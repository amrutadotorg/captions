00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:53.289
I’m very happy to

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:58.539
be here with you, after such a long time and
I missed you all very much.

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:05.580
I know you are very far away from the rest
of them but you are always in My heart and

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.530
you shouldn’t worry about the distance.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.520
We have to realize that we have entered into
a new, a….

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:24.250
This kind of hands you should [HAVE, HAND],
not to hang, if you have to sit properly.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:31.890
You have to understand that we have now entered
into the Kingdom of God and our culture has

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:39.020
to change, our style has to change, our understanding
has to change.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.660
Unless until we change, nobody’s going to
take us seriously.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:50.400
Moreover it’s very difficult to trigger
things if there’s no perfect instrument.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.960
As you know that I went to Russia second time
for the Yoga seminar, where we had people

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.730
from all over the Eastern Block.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.660
That was My idea, to get them there.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.969
And they were from every country, about two
or three people, only.

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:14.390
And very strong, very deep, very understanding.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:23.430
I spoke hardly for 30 minutes and such a miracle,
in fifteen minutes I gave them Realization,

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:34.310
about ten minutes and five minutes I was just
there, and all of them got practically Realization,

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.310
all of them.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.310
Very surprising.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.459
And so deeply, when I walked out of the room,
they all came after Me.

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.510
That you don’t see in western countries,
that kind of a thing.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.810
All of them walked after Me, ran after Me,
they wanted to give their addresses and they

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.230
wanted Me to go to their country and this
and that.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.859
I said: “All right, I’ll come!”

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:57.060
We took their addresses, even from Romania,
everywhere.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.620
And they went back.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.819
And within 8 days one could trigger out the
thing.

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:19.069
It worked, because they were so deep, because
they were so much equipped to trigger the

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:20.069
happening.

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.129
That’s how they triggered their country
and how they worked it out.

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:31.760
So, if we live on a superficial level of Sahaja
Yoga, then we cannot do much for ourselves

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.749
nor for the country and it’s just a wasteful
life, neither here nor there.

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:41.999
Is like a seed, which is sprouted and has
not grown into the tree.

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:47.930
So first of all we have to learn that we have
to become very deep people, very deep, you

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.610
must teach our depth.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:55.260
I’ve heard that people come to Pujas and
things and their main interest is in food.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.959
As soon as the Puja is over you just rush
for food.

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.349
How can you?

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.969
After Puja you get into a mood, after meditation
you get into a mood of meditating nature and

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:11.420
you just sit down and you can’t get up,
because you were fallen into the well and

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.540
sort of thing happens.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.139
How can you just get up and walk for cakes
or things.

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.319
We though can’t think about.

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:22.300
So then judge yourself, how you are, how far
you are.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:33.280
You have to work out your vibrations because
you are going to create that beautiful vision

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.759
in this country, for your children, for yourself
and for the whole country, ultimately for

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:41.700
the whole world.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.699
But if you do not take it up seriously, just
by the way, Sahaja Yoga is just by the way,

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.180
it doesn’t work out.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.680
It has to be way of life.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.250
And in everything that you do it has to be
a Sahaj culture.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:59.539
And in Sahaj culture so many things are to
be understood that this is natural, this is

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:03.400
real and we have to accept the way it is.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.570
So many things are happening the West, which
I think are just destructive, absolutely destructive

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:09.960
to the society.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.590
The society is not at all looked after, here.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:23.150
Maybe I would blame this to the women of Australia
and New Zealand, that women are not understanding

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:32.690
their responsibility and do not understand
what is their [GLORY], also they have not

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:33.840
self esteem.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.830
The other day I was traveling by plane and
most of the ladies were smoking and men were

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.280
not smoking.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.210
Men were looking after the children, the women
were busy smoking like men, you see, looking

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.020
like half men half women.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.919
It’s surprising, this is very destructive.

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:54.229
Because as I have said that that men and women
are like two wheels of a chariot, one on the

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:55.600
left, one on the right.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.409
The left cannot go to the right and right
cannot go to the left.

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:05.400
So we have to understand that our role is
much more important than of the other.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.189
Like the men have an important role, as well
as the women have even more important role.

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:13.630
To be a mother itself is a very big thing.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.520
Why God has given you the motherhood?

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:22.310
Because God thinks you are like the Mother
Earth, that you look after, nourish the child,

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.009
nourish the family, do all these things.

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:32.860
Don’t try to follow the methods of men,
like smoking, drinking, behaving like them.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.100
You just see the trend, how far it is going,
the self-esteem is so low.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:43.680
Now, for women, the other day I was, I was
telling you about the way they are talking

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.970
about sexy, sexy women.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:52.240
I mean it’s…one should be ashamed of saying
such a thing for women.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.860
Because one should take an objection: “We
are not prostitutes that every man should

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.789
look at us and enjoy us.

00:06:57.789 --> 00:06:58.789
Why?

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:04.250
Are we sold out for them or are we something
for show?”

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.810
The women have no self-esteem, they fight
on wrong things, they don’t fight on the

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:09.810
right things.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:14.250
The right is that you should be respected
and you should not be treated like something

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:19.990
on the show, that any man can look at you
and any, that the men should look at you,

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.280
then you have some value.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.280
It’s nonsense.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:29.400
This is not the way to make great nations
and great children and great families.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:37.039
So the society of any country depends on the
women, which is a very solid work, which is

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:39.800
underground, they don’t want to show off.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.449
Any country, which has got good women make
good society.

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:47.629
And I must say the credit goes to Indian women,
in India.

00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:51.469
They have not bothered about these things,
you see, they are not bothered about their

00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:52.990
looks and the sexy nonsense.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:57.860
If somebody says them: “too sexy” I mean
they will slap you, feel very hurt: “What

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.389
is this, what do you think us to be?”

00:08:00.389 --> 00:08:04.389
And to be proud of what work you are doing,
of course you have to work outside and do

00:08:04.389 --> 00:08:08.539
something else, but who will look after the
children, who will manage the households,

00:08:08.539 --> 00:08:11.370
who will keep the peace of the house is to
be seen.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:16.099
So in Sahaj culture one must understand that
women have to be women and men have to be

00:08:16.099 --> 00:08:17.099
men.

00:08:17.099 --> 00:08:20.080
But men must learn to respect the women as
housewives.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.979
[THE AUSTRALIAN DOES] respect them very much.

00:08:22.979 --> 00:08:29.039
If they do not respect their women then also
they will retaliate, they will get rebellier

00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:31.990
and there is all this women’s [REBELLION]
that has started.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:36.070
Is the mistake of men not the women so much,
because they have challenge their personality

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:39.510
so much that now they have started behaving
like this.

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:44.770
So in Sahaja Yoga we respect the women, we
allow them their own freedom, we trust them

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:46.029
and we treat them equal.

00:08:46.029 --> 00:08:47.170
They have to be equal.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.050
They may not be similar but they are equal.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:55.440
The both the wheels have to be equal otherwise
wheel, one is smaller, one is bigger, then

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.010
the chariot will never move forward, it will
go round and round and round.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:04.471
So that is to be understood, that’s very
much important nowadays in the West because

00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:09.260
I find slowly the derailment is towards hell.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:15.350
All these thoughts are going to take people
to nowhere because nobody takes the responsibility

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:20.490
of molding a moral, creating moral values
for children.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:23.209
You have to give proper breeding.

00:09:23.209 --> 00:09:26.339
These days I find children are very undisciplined
here.

00:09:26.339 --> 00:09:28.639
Because we are afraid to face them.

00:09:28.639 --> 00:09:32.750
You have to face them and you have to tell
them that: “This is not so, you are Sahaja

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.880
Yogis and you have to behave like Sahaja Yogis.”

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.620
They have to be modest, they have to be humble.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.320
There should be a kind of an awe for parents.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:46.010
If they don’t have that awe for their parents
how can they have awe for Me or for God?

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:47.010
They cannot.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:48.720
Whatever you may tell them they will not have.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:54.730
If they have no awe at all for the parents
who are Sahaja Yogis that means these children

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:59.860
will become very ward like other children
and that is a very big risk you are running

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:04.040
because I am depending on the children who
are born Realized and I don’t want them

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:09.779
to go haywire because the parents have not
looked after them and faced them.

00:10:09.779 --> 00:10:14.690
So on the whole we must understand the role
of men and women and the respect that you

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:16.100
have to pay to each other.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:20.710
Now, if husband is not respectful to woman
then the children will not be respectful to

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:27.600
her and the whole thing will be finished and
that’s why there is no domination of anyone

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:33.600
as such, there should not be any domination
but everybody has one’s own role and where

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.420
the wife is concerned she should take a decision,
where the man is concerned, he should take

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:42.060
a decision and one must respect it because
these are two different areas in which the

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.720
man has to live and the woman has to live.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:49.750
Wherever this balance goes out, it has gone
out in our country also we should say, in

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:53.720
India, I must say, there are now funny things
are happening thanks to the Muslims, who lived

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:59.320
there and had such an impact that we are having
dowry system and all kinds of other things

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.900
there we have.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.860
But also there are societies, which are trying
to work it out, they are not Sahaja Yogis

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:09.920
but work it out, they are getting improved
and they are trying to change their ways and

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.829
methods and this is coming before the people
to see that things should be all right.

00:11:14.829 --> 00:11:18.579
But supposing the women would have taken some
sort of a weapon in their hands and started

00:11:18.579 --> 00:11:20.570
beating all the men what would have happened?

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.440
You see, you are complementary to each other.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:28.610
So must understand first of all, our role
in Sahaja Yoga that we have to establish our

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:33.240
self-esteem and we have to respect ourselves
and we have to respect others.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:41.680
Because you are all saints and saints have
to respect people…

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:47.079
I’ve been talking all the time.

00:11:47.079 --> 00:11:53.459
So you have to respect the saints that you
are a saint and another one is a saint.

00:11:53.459 --> 00:11:55.139
I always give the example of Namadeva.

00:11:55.139 --> 00:12:01.800
Namadeva was a tailor, the great poet and
a great saint.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:09.519
And he went to see another one who’s name
was Gora Khumbar who was a potter.

00:12:09.519 --> 00:12:15.449
And when he went to see him, Gora Khumbar
was busy knitting the clay to make the pots,

00:12:15.449 --> 00:12:19.430
see, just with his feet he was knitting the
clay.

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:20.660
He looked at him.

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:24.020
When he looked at him, he just stood thoughtless.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:31.300
And then the words he says so beautiful, he
said: “I have come to see the Nirakara,

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:37.920
the Nirguna, the thought...the formless, means
the vibrations.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:43.620
I came to see the vibrations but here it is
in the form, standing”.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:52.050
What an appreciation, what an adoration, from
one saint to another who have never seen the

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:53.050
other person.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:13:01.350
“But I see the whole of this Nirakara, the
Nirguna is in the form of you.”

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.970
Just think of it.

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:05.740
And that is what we have to be.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:11.089
But if we cannot trust other Sahaja Yogis,
we cannot love each other, we cannot understand

00:13:11.089 --> 00:13:14.850
each other that means we are something low,
lower than others.

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:19.250
Some people have a habit of criticizing all
the time: “This is not all right”.

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:22.779
They don’t see that there’s something
wrong with them within themselves that they

00:13:22.779 --> 00:13:24.150
are criticizing others.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:28.180
So there’s no chance for criticizing in
Sahaja Yoga, first thing is that you should

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:33.430
see yourself what you are and where you stand
and how you are going to help yourself first

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:34.430
of all.

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:35.899
Then you can help others.

00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:42.230
But there is no need at all to put a critical
eye on others.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:46.170
Because then you become good for nothing,
you’ve done all the bad things, you see

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:51.279
all the bad things in other people and what
do you develop is a non-collective personality,

00:13:51.279 --> 00:13:57.510
which is such a headache to us and ultimately
you have to go out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:04.100
As I said there are two forces that are working
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:20.779
The first one is the one by which you are
attracted, is called as, is called as the

00:14:20.779 --> 00:14:30.600
centripetal force, centripetal force by which
you are attracted and the another force is,

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.209
is called as the centrifugal force.

00:14:34.209 --> 00:14:40.600
Supposing you have a stone attached to a string,
and you move it with a speed, you see, so

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:46.250
you can keep it moving like that but as soon
as you release it a little bit it can go as

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:47.870
a tangent.

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:54.110
In the same way there are two forces by which
one we are attracted towards Sahaja Yoga,

00:14:54.110 --> 00:15:02.920
we keep one with it, we become part and parcel
of the whole, another one is by which we go

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:03.920
out.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:07.790
Now I find that going out has become a very
strong force.

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:14.470
And I get quite worried about it, not only
that you go out but you go out with very great

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:15.470
problems.

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:24.660
And this is what I’ve seen in
Australia very much working out.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:30.379
First of all if anybody says against Me or
Sahaja Yoga just close your eyes.

00:15:30.379 --> 00:15:35.639
Just say: “We don’t want to hear anything
against it because we have been benefited

00:15:35.639 --> 00:15:41.649
by, we got all the profits out of it and now
you don’t tell us anything.

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:42.970
We don’t want to hear it.”

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:48.410
Just close your eyes and cover your ears and
say: “We don’t want to hear it”.

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:53.569
But we had three cases now where people are
suffering from cancer or this or that, who

00:15:53.569 --> 00:15:54.649
listened to this.

00:15:54.649 --> 00:16:00.620
The man who says may not get it, he may not,
but the one…because he’s already out,

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:05.680
but the one who’s a Sahaja Yogi if he listens
to this thing is very dangerous and should

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:11.140
not listen to anyone like that, who talks
ill about Me or about Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:14.339
This is one point we should understand.

00:16:14.339 --> 00:16:19.899
And then those who find faults with other
Sahaja Yogis are also in trouble.

00:16:19.899 --> 00:16:21.860
You shouldn’t find faults with other Sahaja
Yogis.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:28.069
If you think there’s something wrong with
any Sahaja Yogi you can go and tell the leader.

00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:33.589
If you find anything wrong with the leader
you are welcome to write to Me, immediately.

00:16:33.589 --> 00:16:34.600
You must write to Me.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.029
Is an important thing, because My relationship
with you is tide.

00:16:38.029 --> 00:16:43.750
Leaders are just a myth in a way because I
just telephone to them and tell them because

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:45.329
I can’t telephone to all of you.

00:16:45.329 --> 00:16:46.329
That’s all.

00:16:46.329 --> 00:16:47.570
But it’s a myth.

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:55.890
So anything that you want to do, you must
try to inform Me directly, if they are very

00:16:55.890 --> 00:17:02.680
much hard on you, if they are arrogant, if
they are abusive, if they are taking out money,

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:07.500
anything you find that is not correct you
please let Me know.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:14.760
And immediately from your letter I will know
what is the situation is like and I will let

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.179
you know what is wrong, whether you are wrong
or the leader is wrong.

00:17:18.179 --> 00:17:22.490
But if you just don’t inform Me then I’ll
have to found out Myself.

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:26.630
And by the time I find out I find lots of
harm is done.

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:28.559
So best thing is that you should let me know.

00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:30.830
Because now, today I’m here.

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:37.419
Now I cannot keep attention on Columbia where
I’ve been, I cannot keep attention on America,

00:17:37.419 --> 00:17:40.150
but when I go there My attention is there.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:43.289
But if somebody has any problem they should
write to Me.

00:17:43.289 --> 00:17:50.409
Like this I’ve seen we have got lots of
problems and many Sahaja Yogis have left Sahaja

00:17:50.409 --> 00:17:51.640
Yoga.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.179
Because they never informed Me.

00:17:53.179 --> 00:17:58.100
I can’t understand even now why did they
not write to Me, why did they not telephone

00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.100
to Me.

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:03.670
But for small things they will write, somebody’s
wife is sick, or somebody’s father in law

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:08.330
is in the hospital, or all nonsensical things,
like that they will write.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:12.880
But they will never tell Me that there’s
something is wrong with the leader, till I

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:18.289
discover it, till the whole Sahaja Yoga is
destroyed in that particular city.

00:18:18.289 --> 00:18:23.669
So it’s my humble request that all of you
should know that I’m your Mother, directly.

00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:29.690
I’ve nothing to do with the leaders, as
far as you people are concerned.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:35.000
Any leader who is harsh on you, who’s troublesome
to you, who disciplines you too much, or tries

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.860
to put his ideas all the time on your heads,
or anything like that which you think is curving

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:44.860
your freedom of growth, you must write to
Me and you must know.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:50.330
This is no excuse to say that the leader was
like this, so [UNCLEAR] or “We went away.”

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:51.330
Why did you go away?

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:54.059
What was the need?

00:18:54.059 --> 00:19:00.770
And this I find very common, specially in
Australians and New Zealanders.

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:11.070
Either they become just like complete slaves
or they become absolutely rebellious.

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:13.480
There’s nothing in between.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:19.680
So you have to know that if there is anything
that you find which is trying to dominate

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:24.870
you, you must let us know, and I am always
going to correct and tell them on their faces,

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:27.610
all the leaders, what I think of them.

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:32.940
Because they also know that I’m sitting
down there to look after this.

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:36.890
Of course about leaders I’ve given them
so many times, so many lectures and things

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:42.480
and every time they come to Ganapatipule we
try to meet and talk about it and if there

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.460
is any problem you have to find it pointed
out.

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:49.730
But here I don’t know but in Australia,
specially, the thing what happened, whatever

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:55.510
the leaders were doing, the same thing penetrated
into many Sahaja Yogis and they became sort

00:19:55.510 --> 00:20:04.960
of half leaders and they used to sort of dominate
people and say things which are not at all

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:05.960
Sahaj.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:12.370
Like last year was all right, before that
they started saying Australia is great, we

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:18.110
are the greatest thing, this, that, then half
of the Sahaja Yogis have left them.

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:23.260
Talking so big and bombastically, even the
Indians were surprised, they started looking

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.610
at them thinking what’s gone wrong with
them.

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:30.340
And they reported to Me that: “They would
not listen to anyone, we told them that: ’Please,

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:33.039
better start, we have to go now’ they would
not listen.

00:20:33.039 --> 00:20:35.039
They said: ‘Our leader has to tell us.’.

00:20:35.039 --> 00:20:37.440
They said: “Mother has said”.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.370
“Mother, no, our leader.”

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:44.860
So even the leaders had replaced Me completely
because of these few people who joined hands

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:46.260
with the others like.

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:50.340
We can say, like the bureaucracy of Russia.

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:55.890
There is no bureaucracy, there is no priesthood
in Sahaja Yoga, everybody is equally the same.

00:20:55.890 --> 00:21:02.390
They’re all saints, are to be respected
and all the leaders must respect you and understand

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:03.390
you.

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:08.870
Of course if you have any problems on chakras
that must be told, that is their job and for

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:10.559
that you should be thankful.

00:21:10.559 --> 00:21:14.909
Instead of feeling bad about it you should
be thankful to them that: “Yes, that is

00:21:14.909 --> 00:21:19.260
so and we‘ll try to correct ourselves.”

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:24.570
Now the better part of it that now suddenly
I find there’s a big explosion of Sahaja

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:29.980
Yoga going on in various places where are
least expected like [UNCLEAR] and we have

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:33.049
other places like Turkey and Russia.

00:21:33.049 --> 00:21:35.419
It’s something so remarkable is happening.

00:21:35.419 --> 00:21:42.200
So Sahaja Yoga is taking its fruits well and
maybe these people might grow much faster

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.230
so you have to be careful, you should not
be left behind.

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:50.060
Because there is one thing I’ve given an
indication, I don’t know if you have told

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:57.690
them, last, this Ganapatipule that there is
going to be another jump, another triggering.

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:08.570
I always give the analogy of a air space,
you see, space craft, like we can say the

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:16.820
Sputnik or something, the principle of that,
same is applied to our evolution.

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:21.970
Like first is one container, which has three,
four containers in it.

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:29.810
So the first container goes half way and then
an explosion takes place and then the rest

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:31.309
of it is thrown out.

00:22:31.309 --> 00:22:37.640
So the first speed, that is the velocity that
it has, gets absolutely accelerated and goes

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.730
with a much greater speed.

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:44.309
Then the second one explodes and then the
same thing happens, that’s how the speed

00:22:44.309 --> 00:22:47.159
they ultimately they achieve is very high
up.

00:22:47.159 --> 00:22:55.360
In the same way I feel that in Sahaja Yoga
is now happening and is the time for you to

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.160
know there is going to be another triggering.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:01.210
And that triggering you have to catch up with.

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:07.490
For that you should be prepared, otherwise
you will be left in the container which is

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:09.630
just not to be used to it.

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:15.500
So a new triggering, a new jumping out has
to be done and for that you have to hurry

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.950
up and there’s no time to be lost.

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:24.470
So the most important thing is that we should
develop ourselves into that capacity that

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:29.929
we can jump on to the new triggering that
is going to take place in Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:29.929 --> 00:23:34.529
So I have to warn you though you are few you
have to have a quality, quantity does not

00:23:34.529 --> 00:23:37.960
matter, because so much of quantity might
drop out.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:43.630
So the thing is those who really want to ascent
must understand that we must meditate morning,

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:48.480
evening and we must be absolutely collective.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:53.850
If we are not collective then there’s something
serious with us, something wrong with us and

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:55.500
we have to correct it.

00:23:55.500 --> 00:24:01.230
So these are the things I wanted to tell you
and I must say that the collective here will

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:07.940
now grow very much because of what we did,
today’s miracle that has taken place.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:13.590
Yesterday we had lots of people, every time
I come there are at least three hundred people

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:16.720
and I knew there will be this time also.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:25.770
But what is the difference, when I come they
are there and then they don’t come or even

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:27.700
if they come they disappear.

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:31.130
They must have confidence in you.

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:35.659
First you must have confidence in yourself.

00:24:35.659 --> 00:24:38.750
You must approach them in a way that they
feel confident.

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:43.559
They shouldn’t feel that: “Some silly
stupid people are sitting here just telling

00:24:43.559 --> 00:24:45.150
us about these things”.

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:54.800
But you must have that dignity, you must have
that approach, you must have that understanding,

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:59.600
then only it will work out, otherwise you
cannot work it out.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:09.760
My own idea is that wherever there are very
good deep Sahaja Yogis people stick on.

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.309
Like Austria, I would say.

00:25:12.309 --> 00:25:19.230
In Austria we have quite a lot of [NEW] people
now, [MILAN] we have quite a lot of people.

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:26.809
The reason is both the places, I’ve noticed,
the Sahaja Yogis are of a very great quality.

00:25:26.809 --> 00:25:29.429
They are all working it out.

00:25:29.429 --> 00:25:36.809
Like there’s one boy who has fished out
lots of things from Quran, in German, from

00:25:36.809 --> 00:25:39.480
Quran, what it has to say for Sahaj.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:46.799
And they said there is a Sura called Shasta
Yoga, Shasta Yoga and that Sura is dealing

00:25:46.799 --> 00:25:47.799
with Me.

00:25:47.799 --> 00:25:52.390
Because we will be…it is said that: “We
are going to send and the sent, the One who

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:56.010
is sent will not be acceptable to you.

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:58.020
You will deny, you will defy”.

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:03.090
Everything is described, even that your hands
will speak at the time of Resurrection, all

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:04.770
that in that Sura is given.

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:07.029
It’s very interesting that Sura is.

00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:10.210
So, what I’m saying they are trying to locate
it.

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:14.510
So many things in different things they are
moving now, also they are trying to make very

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:22.700
beautiful paintings and drawings and things,
to be able to explain.

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.840
Also they had TV programs.

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:28.400
So on the TV they told whatever their experience
is, this and that.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:33.899
But if you yourself are not capable, you are
not going to influence anyone even if you

00:26:33.899 --> 00:26:35.440
go to the TV or anywhere.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.990
Nobody’s going to take you seriously.

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:46.409
So you have to be more serious about it and
to be more earnest to do your meditation.

00:26:46.409 --> 00:26:52.260
Now, there’s another aspect of Sahaja Yoga
that we want people to be married.

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:57.360
Married but married is not the last thing,
is not the last thing, is just an assistance,

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:05.840
we can say, a complement from the another
side so that you develop yourself better.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:09.950
But any kind of hindrance in the marriage
can be a great hindrance for your ascent.

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:15.940
So don’t pay any attention to such hindrances,
just get out of it and try to remain your

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:23.159
Self because only it is your Self which is
going to give you joy and ascent, not anybody

00:27:23.159 --> 00:27:24.159
else.

00:27:24.159 --> 00:27:29.610
It will all work out when if you just keep
to your Self and understand that you are important,

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:35.919
you have to look after your ascent, also that
the collective of Sahaja Yoga is important.

00:27:35.919 --> 00:27:41.990
It is very important for all of you because
you are so very few and it has to be worked

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:44.890
out in this country in a big way.

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:49.779
And everybody was asking why is it that in
New Zealand the people are the same, there’s

00:27:49.779 --> 00:27:52.049
not much changing, why not progressing.

00:27:52.049 --> 00:27:58.130
But I’m sure now more will happen and things
the way have triggered out today it might

00:27:58.130 --> 00:27:59.130
work out.

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:05.029
So now this is my own submission about it
and if you think that there’s something

00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:09.900
more I should say about it or something you
want to know you can write to Me, I will definitely

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:10.900
answer such letters.

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:15.649
But I don’t know what to answer to such
letters that: “My husband has run away with

00:28:15.649 --> 00:28:16.929
another woman this thing, that thing”.

00:28:16.929 --> 00:28:20.870
It’s not important, you have been married
so many times in life before.

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:26.610
So what does it matter if he runs away, let
him run away, what to do.

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:36.140
You are a Sahaja Yogi, how many women or how
many men have become Sahaja Yogis in this

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:37.140
world?

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:40.690
So you are so exceptional.

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:45.960
And such exceptional people should not bother
about mundane things and useless things.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.640
They should know their responsibility.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:53.690
It is you who will be responsible for the
emancipation of all the New Zealanders.

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:55.779
And this you must understand.

00:28:55.779 --> 00:28:58.549
You should not try to put your esteem down.

00:28:58.549 --> 00:29:01.210
Try to come up and work it out.

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:04.910
For every nation is important.

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:07.649
Some people are extremely alert and some people
are not.

00:29:07.649 --> 00:29:11.059
But now I’m sure it will work out faster.

00:29:11.059 --> 00:29:17.519
We have lots of people and now try to give
them, give them some tea, something to begin

00:29:17.519 --> 00:29:22.880
with because their attention is on food but
you just don’t start eating [UNCLEAR] otherwise

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:29.780
they’ll think useless people, they are just
trying to…You should show all dignity or

00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:31.070
a hospitality.

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:32.450
Hospitality helps a lot.

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:36.240
That’s a very important thing one should
understand.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:41.650
Like in India if you come, they’ll see ten
times that you have taken your food, they’ll

00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:45.120
call you, somebody’s not there, where are
you, must come and take.

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:49.730
But what I hear is that here nobody calls
anyone, anybody [UNCLEAR] you have your own

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:50.730
food.

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:53.450
Till the guests come outside so nobody says:
“All right.

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:54.450
Will you like…?

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:55.470
Did you have your food or not?

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:56.649
Did you have your breakfast?”

00:29:56.649 --> 00:30:01.280
That’s not the way, we have to be concerned
and we should have those mannerisms, which

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:06.200
are very beautiful of being hospitable to
people, see that they are…

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:12.200
I mean the guests are to be treated in a different
way and the inmates are of a different way

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:16.179
and that’s what whatever you do your children
are going to learn and behave in the same

00:30:16.179 --> 00:30:17.179
manner.

00:30:17.179 --> 00:30:26.450
So we have to get this culture into us by
which we understand the value of other person,

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:33.860
of guests who have come, those who are not
yet Sahaja Yogis, who have yet to become Sahaja

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:36.450
Yogis, who have just got Realization.

00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:44.470
They are to be treated with very great care,
like we can say a seed, which is just sprouted.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:46.309
It’s so delicate.

00:30:46.309 --> 00:30:49.309
The plant is in such a delicate way.

00:30:49.309 --> 00:30:54.120
Now you have to replant it properly into Sahaj
field.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:31:01.080
So what do you do is to take out all the sprouted
ones, slowly one by one, keeping proper distance

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:06.649
between them and try to plant them nicely
into the field of Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:06.649 --> 00:31:12.460
But if you have certain value system, if you
have achieved something, then you shouldn’t

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:16.960
look down upon them or you should not all
the time make fun of them, because some people

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:21.039
are sarcastic, some are all the time smiling,
so they think that: “What is wrong with

00:31:21.039 --> 00:31:23.630
us, why are they smiling, all the time?”.

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:30.279
So there is no need to have artificial smiles,
nor do there’s any need to sort of criticize

00:31:30.279 --> 00:31:37.549
in a way or sometimes [IF] the smile could
be a ridicule, you know people think, they

00:31:37.549 --> 00:31:38.549
misunderstand.

00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:42.470
Or to say that: “Your this bhoot is catching,
that bhoot is catching “ sometimes people

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:44.240
say: “This chakra is catching”.

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.240
Not necessary.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.590
“Gradually, you should say, everything is
going to work out.

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:51.870
If you are not feeling the cool breeze, all
right, let’s see what is the problem is

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:52.870
like.”

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:56.929
But you need not tell them all these things,
this language, this should not be exposed

00:31:56.929 --> 00:32:02.270
to the first comers that they get frightened,
that our this center is catching, that center

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:04.809
is catching, create a big fright.

00:32:04.809 --> 00:32:08.260
So we have to built up their confidence, that’s
very important.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:13.020
Once you have built up their confidence and
once they start feeling the vibrations and

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:17.179
everything, they have to trust you, they have
to believe in you.

00:32:17.179 --> 00:32:26.409
So this is the very small outline of the way
I would like New Zealand to come up and to

00:32:26.409 --> 00:32:31.710
act in a sensible way so that people should
say that New Zealanders are the wisest in

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:32.710
Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:33.710
May God bless you all.

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:34.710
Imagine Greece Sahaja Yoga is only two years
old.

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:35.710
Only two years old.

00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:36.710
Greece.

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:37.710
But that’s a traditional country, see, it’s
an ancient country, and the way the Greeks

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:39.129
have really fallen into Sahaja Yoga is beyond…
