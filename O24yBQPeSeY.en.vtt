00:01:49.792 --> 00:01:54.209
You all have come now to Bangalore,

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.750
and yesterday you had gone to Mysore,

00:01:59.951 --> 00:02:04.144
which was ruled by Mahishasura.

00:02:04.345 --> 00:02:08.247
That’s the reason you didn’t get your
food -

00:02:10.235 --> 00:02:12.550
it crossed you.

00:02:12.751 --> 00:02:18.106
It’s better not to eat food in such places,
isn’t it?

00:02:18.466 --> 00:02:19.822
All right.

00:02:20.023 --> 00:02:26.977
So, it’s a very beautiful place
Bangalore is.

00:02:27.178 --> 00:02:30.885
Climate is beautiful and you’ll find always

00:02:31.086 --> 00:02:36.680
these rakshasas lived in places like this.

00:02:36.881 --> 00:02:39.683
Like in Pune, you have, you know this
Rajneesh was there -

00:02:39.884 --> 00:02:42.844
here is this Mahishasura still.

00:02:43.045 --> 00:02:47.977
They always try to find places which are
cold

00:02:48.178 --> 00:02:52.471
because they have so much heat in their
body.

00:02:54.003 --> 00:03:01.564
Now as you know, there’s one more rakshasa
here who has to be exposed.

00:03:01.987 --> 00:03:07.952
And this, today through our puja, we
should achieve.

00:03:14.705 --> 00:03:20.489
In the olden days, when the Goddess had
to fight the rakshasas,

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:29.522
the rakshasas were not involved in human
beings as such.

00:03:29.723 --> 00:03:33.987
They didn’t become gurus or anything.

00:03:34.188 --> 00:03:39.389
And so, now we find in Kali Yuga,

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:47.172
they have gone into the brains of sadhakas,
of their devotees.

00:03:47.373 --> 00:03:50.398
It’s very difficult to remove them.

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.974
And once they go into the brain
of the sadhakas,

00:03:55.175 --> 00:03:59.540
then sadhakas become, of course, possessed,

00:03:59.761 --> 00:04:05.080
they suffer, they have all kinds
of problems.

00:04:05.281 --> 00:04:09.132
Despite that, they stick onto that person

00:04:09.333 --> 00:04:14.050
because they are mesmerized, very much
mesmerized.

00:04:14.251 --> 00:04:20.437
And this mesmerism makes them absolutely
so strong headed

00:04:20.638 --> 00:04:25.803
that even if they have to die, they
won’t give up their gurus.

00:04:30.739 --> 00:04:37.217
The main thing is that in this Kali Yuga
there are so many sadhakas,

00:04:37.418 --> 00:04:41.358
they are running helter and skelter.
They are running all over,

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:46.147
trying to find out some way of finding
the truth.

00:04:46.348 --> 00:04:52.239
While when the market is on, you know,
you get people to sell it also.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.955
So that’s how so many have come up

00:04:55.156 --> 00:05:00.163
and are trying these things, tricks,
on people all over.

00:05:00.364 --> 00:05:07.191
Most of them have gone to the Western
countries because people have money.

00:05:07.392 --> 00:05:10.956
Thank God we are not so rich in India

00:05:11.157 --> 00:05:16.464
that they could not befool us - especially
in America.

00:05:16.665 --> 00:05:23.523
And Americans took to these people as
a fish takes to water, very surprisingly.

00:05:23.724 --> 00:05:29.242
I went there and told them and warned
them - they wouldn’t listen to me.

00:05:29.443 --> 00:05:33.772
They can’t understand anything that you
can get without money.

00:05:33.973 --> 00:05:40.376
But despite all that, so many of you have
been able

00:05:40.577 --> 00:05:44.538
to come to Sahaja Yoga and get
to the reality.

00:05:44.739 --> 00:05:51.430
It’s your destiny. It’s blessings to you
of your previous lives

00:05:51.631 --> 00:05:55.870
that you could see it so clearly and come
to Sahaja Yoga;

00:05:56.071 --> 00:06:01.226
and now you have grown so much, you have
become so matured

00:06:01.427 --> 00:06:07.951
and you understand what others are doing
is absolutely wrong.

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:16.379
Also somebody told me about this fellow
Boy John (George) misbehaving

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.939
with these homosexuals and all that,

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.289
and calling them “Hare Rama, Hare
Krishna” - all nonsense.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:27.939
Then I discovered that this story is very
prevalent in Kerala,

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.817
where they say that Krishna when He became,

00:06:33.018 --> 00:06:39.815
I mean Vishnu, when He became Mohini,
He had a child from Shiva. Absurd.

00:06:40.016 --> 00:06:42.455
And now, Murti is telling me when I told
you this story,

00:06:42.656 --> 00:06:47.137
you said, “This is blasphemy, this is sin.”
Same way I feel.

00:06:47.338 --> 00:06:51.399
It’s very dangerous also to play about
with a person like Vishnu.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.357
He is a very dangerous deity.

00:06:54.558 --> 00:07:00.006
Shiva, ultimately, is very dangerous but
it takes time with Him.

00:07:00.207 --> 00:07:04.111
But as far as Vishnu is concerned, one has
to be very careful,

00:07:04.312 --> 00:07:08.132
misbehaving like this. I don’t know
what is going to happen to them.

00:07:08.333 --> 00:07:13.663
But they are so stupid, they are so stupid.

00:07:13.864 --> 00:07:20.772
One thing they should judge that if this
thing you are doing is good for them,

00:07:20.983 --> 00:07:26.657
is by God’s blessings, then why should you
get diseases?

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.674
There is a regular one crore of people,
going to a nonsensical place

00:07:32.875 --> 00:07:35.756
where they have this Ayappa business,

00:07:35.957 --> 00:07:40.200
and they wear black dresses for one month,

00:07:40.401 --> 00:07:44.353
and they have their beard and everything.

00:07:44.554 --> 00:07:50.406
They starve themselves, they go up, miles
together they climb,

00:07:50.607 --> 00:07:55.619
do all kinds of things that is a sort
of a suffering for one month.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:02.622
And eleven months they do everything.
This kind of a nonsense, you see.

00:08:02.823 --> 00:08:08.730
So now it has become like a craze like
jogging or something like that in Kerala.

00:08:08.931 --> 00:08:14.200
And this year there were one crore
of people doing this stupid nonsense.

00:08:14.401 --> 00:08:18.593
I mean, even in India we have such stupid
people, you can see that.

00:08:18.794 --> 00:08:25.009
But the number is not so much, I must say,
as it is in America, percentage.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:29.642
In India, we are very conditioned
by this ritualism,

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:32.962
especially in the South we have lots
of ritualistic things.

00:08:33.163 --> 00:08:37.102
And we are impressed by people if you take
out some watches,

00:08:37.303 --> 00:08:40.512
Swiss made watches, or things like that.

00:08:40.713 --> 00:08:43.761
To them, it’s something really remarkable
that how can you have

00:08:43.962 --> 00:08:49.999
Swiss made watches here. Very simple
people.

00:08:50.381 --> 00:08:58.839
They do not understand that none
of the incarnations did these tricks

00:08:59.327 --> 00:09:08.602
and that truth should be based on
the tradition, on the shastras.

00:09:08.803 --> 00:09:13.901
It cannot deviate and whatever deviates

00:09:14.102 --> 00:09:21.365
is actually heretic and also is blasphemy.

00:09:21.566 --> 00:09:28.202
But as I told you the other day that those
people who talk of knowledge, like Sufis,

00:09:28.403 --> 00:09:33.756
who got their realisation, real Sufis, they
were called as heretics -

00:09:33.957 --> 00:09:39.444
they were thrown out of the religion.
Also the Christians -

00:09:39.645 --> 00:09:46.185
the early Christians, who were Gnostics -
were called as mad people, heretics.

00:09:46.386 --> 00:09:50.220
In the same way, those who are following
stupid things,

00:09:50.421 --> 00:09:56.607
and are following something that is very
black and dark, negative,

00:09:56.808 --> 00:10:00.484
will definitely go against Sahaja Yoga

00:10:00.685 --> 00:10:09.016
and will say that this is something heretic
or it is something that is blasphemy.

00:10:09.534 --> 00:10:13.309
But, as you understand now what it is,

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:18.904
we have to bring forth new laws that those
who are not Sahaja Yogis

00:10:19.105 --> 00:10:22.637
are actually, if they are practicing any
religion,

00:10:22.845 --> 00:10:26.917
they are not doing the right thing.

00:10:27.132 --> 00:10:30.850
Slowly slowly, as Vatican is getting
exposed

00:10:31.051 --> 00:10:33.807
and the Christian churches are getting
exposed,

00:10:34.008 --> 00:10:38.381
even in India, so many such organisations
are getting exposed,

00:10:38.582 --> 00:10:43.404
and people are understanding that this is
very wrong.

00:10:44.932 --> 00:10:55.794
These ideas actually have come from
incarnations only,

00:10:55.995 --> 00:11:01.540
like Adi Shankaracharya himself has said,
“Tatatkim, tatatkim, tatatkim” -

00:11:01.741 --> 00:11:04.490
if you have not followed your guru,
then “tatatkim”.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:09.144
So they said now any guru can come
from the jail,

00:11:09.345 --> 00:11:15.854
can be a smuggler, can be anything,
characterless person -

00:11:16.058 --> 00:11:20.091
if you call him a guru, then he is a guru.

00:11:20.497 --> 00:11:26.650
Whatever we call somebody, say we call
somebody as a guru

00:11:27.163 --> 00:11:30.578
and we stick on, “This is my guru.”

00:11:30.779 --> 00:11:35.718
But what did the guru give to you, that
nobody asks.

00:11:35.919 --> 00:11:38.927
We just feel happy, “Oh, very nice.”

00:11:39.128 --> 00:11:44.204
It’s like the worms clinging onto the lotus
and saying, “Oh, we have lotus.”

00:11:44.405 --> 00:11:48.971
What about you, you are a worm still,
what is the use of these lotuses?

00:11:49.172 --> 00:11:53.651
Or whether that is lotus or a snake, God
only knows.

00:11:53.852 --> 00:12:00.349
So a guru who doesn’t talk of realisation,
who doesn’t talk of Kundalini,

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:05.782
who doesn’t talk of ascent, who doesn’t
talk of second birth -

00:12:05.983 --> 00:12:10.456
cannot be a guru - minimum of minimum.

00:12:11.313 --> 00:12:17.587
So like we also believe in say Rama,
“I believe in Rama.” So what?

00:12:17.788 --> 00:12:21.782
Are you obliging Rama or Rama is obliging
you?

00:12:21.983 --> 00:12:25.379
“I believe in Christ” - so what?

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.037
You believe in this, you believe in that -

00:12:28.238 --> 00:12:31.234
it’s such an absurd idea, still I never
understand

00:12:31.435 --> 00:12:35.028
when people say, “I believe in this.”

00:12:35.229 --> 00:12:38.743
But what does that mean, what does that
mean?

00:12:38.944 --> 00:12:41.545
You believe in Christ.

00:12:41.746 --> 00:12:44.551
You are leading a licentious life, you are
doing all kinds -

00:12:44.752 --> 00:12:51.642
but “I believe in Christ, I believe
in God.”

00:12:51.843 --> 00:12:56.922
Doing everything against divinity, and
“I believe”.

00:12:57.267 --> 00:13:01.404
So the question comes: what do you mean
by believing?

00:13:01.605 --> 00:13:07.176
It’s like, “I believe, it is silver” -
so what? It is silver.

00:13:07.377 --> 00:13:11.133
What does it make to you to believe by that
saying something

00:13:11.334 --> 00:13:16.549
you have done great? What is great in that?

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:21.446
Now if you say, “I believe in
Shri Mataji” - so what?

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:28.098
All right, you believe in me because
of certain experiences - still what?

00:13:29.566 --> 00:13:36.454
Mataji should be in your life, should be
in your expression,

00:13:36.655 --> 00:13:42.253
in your behaviour, in your treatment
to others,

00:13:42.454 --> 00:13:46.751
in understanding each other, and loving
each other.

00:13:46.952 --> 00:13:49.818
That is what impresses people.

00:13:50.019 --> 00:13:52.966
People say, “All right, we’ll come to
Mataji, we’ll just pray to Her

00:13:53.167 --> 00:13:56.720
and go away - we’ll not talk to you.” Why?

00:13:56.921 --> 00:14:00.897
“Because we believe in Mataji, finished.”

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.518
So now we have to understand that you
believe in Sahaja Yoga,

00:14:05.719 --> 00:14:10.330
of course, it is Shraddha (faith), it is
not a blind faith, I agreed,

00:14:10.531 --> 00:14:14.741
but still belief has to penetrate into your
being.

00:14:14.942 --> 00:14:19.339
This belief has to act, has to show
results,

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:25.325
it has to work out in every way.

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:29.770
Somebody might say that we believe
in Mataji and She does everything -

00:14:29.971 --> 00:14:32.409
She’ll do bhakti for us.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:37.370
I should sit down and sing the song
of Mataji or what.

00:14:38.524 --> 00:14:44.899
So what is going to come from your side,
that is what we have to understand;

00:14:45.111 --> 00:14:48.449
and once that starts working, then these
demons

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:53.103
and these rakshasas will all vanish,
no problem.

00:14:53.304 --> 00:14:57.626
So: “What am I doing for Sahaja Yoga?”

00:14:57.827 --> 00:15:01.436
We should ask the question, “What am I
doing?”

00:15:01.637 --> 00:15:07.527
Now if you make this instrument, and then
if it is not doing anything,

00:15:07.735 --> 00:15:11.503
what is the use of making the instrument?

00:15:16.137 --> 00:15:20.757
Now you are the light, you have got
enlightenment:

00:15:21.222 --> 00:15:24.198
but what is the use of a light which is
hanging somewhere,

00:15:24.399 --> 00:15:27.900
which is not giving light to anyone?

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:36.105
So when you are giving light to others,
in a very innocent manner,

00:15:36.306 --> 00:15:41.515
in a very reciprocal manner - not this way
that we are giving light

00:15:41.716 --> 00:15:44.803
because we want to have an advantage
over it,

00:15:45.004 --> 00:15:50.001
or we want to show off or any all
nonsensical things that are there.

00:15:50.202 --> 00:15:52.237
Then the derailment starts.

00:15:52.462 --> 00:15:56.700
People start saying, “Oh, I am this,
I am that.”

00:15:57.431 --> 00:16:04.665
But with full understanding, that we are
instruments in the hands of the divinity

00:16:04.866 --> 00:16:11.573
and we are just enjoying that divinity
flowing through us and working out,

00:16:11.774 --> 00:16:14.211
you won’t feel tired, you won’t feel
upset,

00:16:14.412 --> 00:16:19.369
you’ll not be in any way in trouble.

00:16:19.933 --> 00:16:23.440
But this has happened with you.

00:16:23.751 --> 00:16:29.479
You are so matured, but still, we all have
to decide

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:34.703
that now we are going to India to get
ourselves the whole joy of the tour.

00:16:34.904 --> 00:16:37.725
But for what?

00:16:39.197 --> 00:16:43.738
Not to keep to yourself, but to share it
with others.

00:16:43.939 --> 00:16:48.751
This joy is for you to share it with
others.

00:16:48.952 --> 00:16:54.698
Unless and until you learn that, your ego
will come back again and again.

00:16:54.899 --> 00:16:59.727
And also you have seen the way

00:16:59.928 --> 00:17:06.150
people who have been even spreading Sahaja
Yoga got into the mess of ego.

00:17:06.351 --> 00:17:11.954
So one has to be very careful. The more
you are rising in your divinity,

00:17:12.155 --> 00:17:16.811
the more you are maturing, you have
to be very careful.

00:17:17.012 --> 00:17:24.332
See on a tree if you see, if there’s
a leaf, no insect will enter.

00:17:24.533 --> 00:17:30.120
If there’s a flower, the insect will come
and it will make it into a fruit.

00:17:30.321 --> 00:17:36.324
But when it is a fruit, then the insect
will enter and eat it off.

00:17:36.525 --> 00:17:39.794
So when you are becoming a fruit, you have
to be very careful

00:17:39.995 --> 00:17:42.988
that no insect should get into you.

00:17:43.189 --> 00:17:49.414
On the contrary, now you have [the]
capacity to destroy all the insects.

00:17:49.622 --> 00:17:57.521
And that is what is, I would say, is
the state where we should all come up to.

00:17:57.751 --> 00:18:00.081
So you are destroying insects on one side

00:18:00.282 --> 00:18:04.469
and satisfying people on the other side.

00:18:04.817 --> 00:18:11.191
Collectivity is, of course no doubt, is
the only way you can be cleansed;

00:18:11.392 --> 00:18:14.878
but the greater thing is to go out,
all out, to find out,

00:18:15.079 --> 00:18:18.119
“Where can I spread Sahaja Yoga?
Where can I go?

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:22.362
What is the nearest village I can go?
Where will I work it out?”

00:18:22.563 --> 00:18:25.918
All those things the more you think,
the better it is,

00:18:26.119 --> 00:18:30.585
and you start moving in that direction.

00:18:30.786 --> 00:18:33.334
Once you start moving in that direction,
you will be surprised

00:18:33.535 --> 00:18:36.488
Sahaja Yoga will move ahead of you.

00:18:36.689 --> 00:18:39.448
You’ll meet the people whom you want,

00:18:39.649 --> 00:18:44.691
you’ll get all the necessary help that
you want,

00:18:44.892 --> 00:18:47.956
suddenly you’ll find some people who will
come down

00:18:48.157 --> 00:18:52.382
and say, “Now, what can we do for you?”

00:18:52.583 --> 00:18:58.090
Every type of help starts coming to you
the way you expand yourself.

00:18:58.291 --> 00:19:03.810
It’s like the expanding your wings, like
a bird does,

00:19:04.011 --> 00:19:10.881
and then you take off. But if you don’t
extend yourself,

00:19:11.121 --> 00:19:17.120
you keep Sahaja Yoga to yourself only,
it doesn’t work.

00:19:18.494 --> 00:19:22.551
I know you love me very much and you know
I love you very much,

00:19:22.752 --> 00:19:28.700
but don’t you think others should also
share this love,

00:19:28.901 --> 00:19:32.411
others should also have this?

00:19:32.612 --> 00:19:37.350
Now when we start struggling, we also
struggle with people

00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:42.514
who are very difficult - like “my brother,
my brother’s son...”

00:19:42.715 --> 00:19:48.803
Just don’t go near my, get away.
My is the most difficult thing.

00:19:49.004 --> 00:19:53.467
You see, in my family, I don’t touch them

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:56.428
because once you go to my they sit
on your heads,

00:19:56.629 --> 00:20:02.121
or maybe they’ll sit on the heads of the
Sahaja Yogis or something, nothing.

00:20:02.322 --> 00:20:05.041
So don’t go to the people – “it is
my sister,

00:20:05.242 --> 00:20:08.299
she is my sister-in-law”, nothing
of the kind.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:14.090
What you have to do is to see what is
beyond

00:20:14.291 --> 00:20:18.670
and the more you’ll go beyond, the better
it will be.

00:20:20.211 --> 00:20:23.243
See, you can see clearly, we’ve worked
so hard in Maharashtra,

00:20:23.444 --> 00:20:28.915
it is a useless place I find. Maharashtrian
Sahaja Yogis are few, very few,

00:20:29.116 --> 00:20:32.537
but whatever are there are also not
so good.

00:20:32.738 --> 00:20:36.549
While Delhi Sahaja Yogis, now here
in Madras, in Bangalore,

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:40.929
see what nice Sahaja Yogis are there.

00:20:42.051 --> 00:20:45.600
So much work I have done there.

00:20:45.889 --> 00:20:52.119
So those who are very near to you, always
cannot see the greatness of you.

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:57.791
Like if you go near the big mountain, you
cannot see the big mountain,

00:20:57.992 --> 00:21:00.985
you have to be away and then you see.
In the same way,

00:21:01.186 --> 00:21:04.149
when you want to do some work with anyone,

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:07.592
try to see that you are not closely
related,

00:21:07.793 --> 00:21:12.366
nor do you have any connections with them.
Something unknown.

00:21:12.567 --> 00:21:15.797
These people are much better for you
to follow

00:21:15.998 --> 00:21:21.099
and they will keep your attention tight,
absolutely on you.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:26.356
Otherwise, the people who are known
to you will trouble you.

00:21:26.557 --> 00:21:29.640
Now there are many difficulties in
spreading Sahaja Yoga -

00:21:29.841 --> 00:21:35.684
there were many, many more before, slowly
these are coming down.

00:21:35.885 --> 00:21:40.054
Naturally, it is much better than at
the time of Thomas [the Apostle]

00:21:40.255 --> 00:21:44.280
because he had to hide his treatise
to save it from others.

00:21:44.481 --> 00:21:47.660
He thought a day will come when there
will be resurrection time,

00:21:47.861 --> 00:21:51.521
then this treatise would be [revealed].
Imagine, only 48 years back,

00:21:51.722 --> 00:21:57.097
now it would be around 53 or 50 years
back, it was discovered.

00:21:58.641 --> 00:22:03.895
It was not discovered before. He had
to hide it.

00:22:04.096 --> 00:22:06.489
But now we are not to hide.

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:11.840
We are to go all out and must know,
must forgive.

00:22:12.041 --> 00:22:17.001
That, you see, ours is an open place where
anybody can come in.

00:22:17.202 --> 00:22:19.663
So we get all kinds of people - if you go
and meet people,

00:22:19.864 --> 00:22:25.483
also there is all kinds of oppositions,
all these things, doesn’t matter.

00:22:25.684 --> 00:22:30.067
Everything can be overcome, but first is
your own initiative

00:22:30.268 --> 00:22:34.828
and your own lethargy which has to be
overcome.

00:22:37.442 --> 00:22:39.594
Then it will start spreading out.

00:22:39.795 --> 00:22:42.730
Of course, we have already lot of Sahaja
Yogis -

00:22:42.931 --> 00:22:46.833
in Russia, if you see, we have so many,
in thousands.

00:22:47.034 --> 00:22:51.192
But in every place we can have lots
of people now

00:22:51.393 --> 00:22:55.686
and I’m sure this is a nice year where they
say so, predict

00:22:55.887 --> 00:22:58.800
that Sahaja Yoga will grow very much
this year.

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:02.148
So this is the beginning we are starting
today.

00:23:02.364 --> 00:23:05.339
I just wanted to tell you that you have
the power,

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:09.290
you have the shakti within your reach.

00:23:09.491 --> 00:23:14.864
They said it was very cold one day before
I came here,

00:23:15.065 --> 00:23:18.407
I said, “Don’t worry.” I didn’t give
bandhan or anything.

00:23:18.608 --> 00:23:24.154
I just came here and how they know!

00:23:24.355 --> 00:23:28.553
It’s become all right, you are sitting
in your kurta pyjamas.

00:23:28.754 --> 00:23:34.002
Otherwise, you would have been in your
three-piece suits shivering.

00:23:34.203 --> 00:23:39.779
That’s how it works. But you have to be
that way dedicated.

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:44.383
Now for all these: Surya [sun] and Chandra
[moon]

00:23:44.584 --> 00:23:51.459
and all these stars and the whole cosmos
has only one thing to do -

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:57.821
is to see that Sahaja Yoga is spreading
well,

00:23:58.022 --> 00:24:03.237
is settling well and is achieving its goal.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.178
Every element is working it out.

00:24:08.379 --> 00:24:13.149
Everything is working - this Paramchaitanya
is working around in so many ways.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:15.779
You are not to be convinced about me,
I know.

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:17.817
But now you have to be convinced
about yourself

00:24:18.035 --> 00:24:21.680
that you have all the powers within you.

00:24:21.881 --> 00:24:25.054
I mean, I don’t do anything really, to be
very frank.

00:24:25.255 --> 00:24:29.820
If I could do everything, I would not have
had you, I would have done it myself.

00:24:30.021 --> 00:24:33.214
But you have to do it - you are my
channels.

00:24:33.415 --> 00:24:38.684
You are the channels of Shakti. But do it
in a way which is gracious,

00:24:38.885 --> 00:24:42.635
which is beautiful, which is very
satisfying.

00:24:42.836 --> 00:24:48.403
Like yesterday, that musician - he just
wanted to entertain you.

00:24:48.604 --> 00:24:54.600
He wanted to play. I mean, he was
enjoying it.

00:24:54.801 --> 00:25:01.044
In the same way, we should want to do it.
I don’t have to tell you.

00:25:01.245 --> 00:25:06.471
And I am sure, in every area that you work,

00:25:06.672 --> 00:25:10.806
in every personality whom you meet,

00:25:11.007 --> 00:25:14.480
you can start talking about Sahaja Yoga
and tell them.

00:25:14.681 --> 00:25:18.070
It works. It acts.

00:25:18.271 --> 00:25:23.385
Moreover, it is behind you the whole power
of all the deities,

00:25:23.586 --> 00:25:27.634
and in front is Sahaja Yoga running
forward fast, this Paramchaitanya:

00:25:27.835 --> 00:25:30.126
“Now the Sahaja Yogis are coming,
all right,

00:25:30.327 --> 00:25:36.013
let them not eat their food, finished” -
organising.

00:25:36.267 --> 00:25:40.191
Everything so beautifully done. Now
see the arrangements and all -

00:25:40.406 --> 00:25:45.891
I mean, I was thinking such few people
here, and about 20 Sahaja Yogis in Madras -

00:25:46.092 --> 00:25:50.320
can you believe it, all this arrangement?

00:25:51.109 --> 00:25:58.847
How it’s working out, how it is giving
results, it’s really remarkable.

00:25:59.841 --> 00:26:04.819
So have faith in yourself, have faith
in all of them helping you,

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:08.239
not to be nervous and just go ahead.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:13.045
Because the shakti is in you. You have
the power.

00:26:13.246 --> 00:26:17.274
Every kind of power you have, I assure
you, you have every power.

00:26:17.475 --> 00:26:19.504
Ask for it and you’ll
have it.

00:26:19.705 --> 00:26:22.237
Whatever you ask for it, it will happen.

00:26:22.438 --> 00:26:29.704
But don’t hesitate. As I said the other
day, that I make you sit on the throne,

00:26:29.905 --> 00:26:33.750
then also I put the crown on your head.

00:26:33.951 --> 00:26:40.882
And also I say, “Now you are the king,”
but still you are running away

00:26:41.083 --> 00:26:44.352
and not believing me - looking this side
with fear –

00:26:44.553 --> 00:26:47.703
“Am I a king really? How can I be?”

00:26:47.904 --> 00:26:52.077
That’s not the way. Have faith in yourself.

00:26:52.278 --> 00:26:56.224
I am very happy you all have come here.

00:26:56.425 --> 00:26:59.899
We are trying to do whatever is possible

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:06.632
to make you comfortable and for you
to provide whatever is necessary.

00:27:06.833 --> 00:27:11.466
Of course, you are only just Spirits

00:27:11.667 --> 00:27:15.882
and you try to find the comfort of your
Spirit.

00:27:16.083 --> 00:27:21.077
I know that you are very adjusting
yourself.

00:27:21.532 --> 00:27:24.756
Everybody is surprised how you people
from the West -

00:27:24.957 --> 00:27:31.018
who just believe in materialism - can take
to Sahaja Yoga: they are quite surprised.

00:27:32.467 --> 00:27:38.176
But you are all very sweet people,

00:27:38.377 --> 00:27:45.129
I think, something very special who have
come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:46.409 --> 00:27:51.979
And by God’s grace, I’m sure

00:27:52.186 --> 00:27:56.603
you will be the people who will be
the foundation of Sahaja Yoga

00:27:56.804 --> 00:28:07.272
and you will build the great mansion
of Sahaja Yoga

00:28:07.637 --> 00:28:15.929
with your wisdom, faith, shakti and love.

00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:22.280
Today we’ll worship the Shakti - it’s very
much needed -

00:28:22.481 --> 00:28:27.710
the Shakti who destroyed all the devils,
all the rakshasas.

00:28:27.911 --> 00:28:34.178
That is what we are going to worship
today - the Shakti within you and without.

00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:37.446
It’s your desire which is going to work.

00:28:37.647 --> 00:28:42.907
So today we are going to worship
the Shakti itself - Mahakali.

00:28:43.108 --> 00:28:46.210
May God bless you.

00:28:59.471 --> 00:29:03.445
So, today first we’ll have the washing
of Feet

00:29:03.703 --> 00:29:07.403
and with that we’ll have (Hindi)

00:29:11.467 --> 00:29:15.020
one Atharva Shirsha we’ll do

00:29:15.221 --> 00:29:19.780
and then we can have thousand names,

00:29:22.948 --> 00:29:32.532
which are made very easily compiled
together

00:29:32.754 --> 00:29:36.049
by the Noida people, which you can sing.

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:40.459
That’s how we can worship the Shakti.
