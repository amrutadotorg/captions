00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.280
They have asked Me to speak in Hindi language.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.040
I think you people will excuse Me.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.840
Later on I'll explain to you what I said in short.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.360
Today we are standing at a point,

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.920
which we can call as a dividing line

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.520
between materialism and spirituality.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.720
I am going to speak on that subject in Hindi language.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.960
[HINDI ]

01:02:55.480 --> 01:03:01.760
I have told them only the pangs of materialism.

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:06.880
How you people are suffering and how everything is sellable.

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:10.120
Everything becomes sellable, chastity is sellable,

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.880
goodness is sellable, everything is sellable.

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:17.440
Then what happens, that you just have the money, so called,

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.920
for a very short time,

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:22.720
and actually people are bankrupt.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:26.120
Healthwise, mentally they are really bankrupt.

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:30.960
So this materialism is to be understood in the Lakshmi principle,

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:34.480
which is that you should have love.

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:38.080
Lakshmi is the personification of love.

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:43.720
She wears always a pink sari. Pink is the...

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:50.440
... is the representative of her loving character.

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:54.800
So if you can turn everything to love, materialism will be finished,

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.200
because they are on opposite direction.

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.840
And that's what I have tried to explain to them,

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:05.280
by many references here and there, how you can overcome materialism.

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:09.200
I wish somebody could translate this and give it to the people,

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.240
so they can understand.

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:14.080
But I think, with vibrations it will work out better.

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:17.480
May God bless you.

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:20.920
