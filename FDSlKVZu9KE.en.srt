1
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:38,680
Today we are here to celebrate Sahastrar Day.

2
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:56,940
It was not very difficult for Me to open the

3
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:04,820
Sahastrar because there were so many seekers
in this world: because, of course, I had studied

4
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:15,810
also, the permutations and combinations from
which you all are, in a way, suffering. Also,

5
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:30,389
the time had come. I felt [that] horrible
gurus, who are really devils, are trying to

6
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:42,220
capture all the seekers. I thought it's high
time that Sahastrara should be opened out.

7
00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:01,180
It was not like Christ’s crucifixion by
any chance. In those days one had to do lot

8
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:14,099
of tapasya and that’s what He went through.
But in these modern times, what you know 
is much more important than what you do.

9
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:38,300
It is such a universal awareness now because
of maybe, medias, because of communications,

10
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:51,730
because of travelling, that a human mind knows
a lot. It knows so much sometimes that its

11
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,000
brain cannot even bear it. It is so overloaded
with ideas and also the human mind is all

12
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:15,019
the time anxious to grasp, absorb and retain
whatever he thinks is knowledge. But he lacks

13
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:26,810
discretion, so all kind of things are accumulated
in his brain in the modern times. Specially

14
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:34,730
with the advent of all this media like television,
computers. Not a media, but it’s quite a

15
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:51,310
complicated brain again...the man had to know
the technique of all these things very much.

16
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:03,220
And this technique, if he understood, he could
do many things, many more things than your

17
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:10,220
forefathers could do. Thus, materialism started
taking its own development in the minds of

18
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:25,220
people. So the curse of human beings, at that
time, was materialism: when I felt that Sahastrara

19
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:34,070
must be opened out.

20
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:41,070
Before that, people were just simple, innocent:
they all believed in God, they never doubted,

21
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:51,060
and they didn't even seek the Truth. This
materialism created such a competition among

22
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:02,279
human beings, such hypocrisy, that people
started finding out that: this is not honest,

23
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:16,850
materialism is not joy-giving, you can't get
peace out of materialism. Just it started

24
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:27,540
developing into their awareness that this
is not the end of our achievement, this is

25
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:34,540
not what we have to know, this is not what
is going to give us joy and peace.

26
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:44,410
Specially after war, this awareness started
growing very much among young people. This

27
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:55,040
is also because, now, the human awareness
had reached the state of the brain. That's

28
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:05,920
how they started knowing better, absorbing
better and retaining better. You take a little

29
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,350
child of today, he knows much better than
you would have known when you were even 25

30
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:22,350
years of age; because he’s supposed to know
about everything. And thus, there was no movement

31
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:36,779
towards knowing what is the Truth.But, as
this awareness grew more and more, lots of

32
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:54,100
seekers were created on this earth. So many
people, who never knew they were seekers,

33
00:12:55,029 --> 00:13:02,029
suddenly became seekers. It's a atmospheric
effect, I should say. And thus, a new category

34
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:13,610
of people were born, became aware, that they
have to find out the Truth.

35
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:21,810
So, it was all simultaneously, according to
the time, that Sahastrara was to be opened

36
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:38,320
out. And thus, this happened. For us sahaja
yogis, of course, Sahastrara is the biggest

37
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:49,680
event. Or we should say - whatever work all
the incarnations have done, all the seers

38
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:59,389
and saints and prophets have done, this is
the culminating point. They did it for individuals,

39
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:10,279
but to do for masses, that it should go to
every nook and corner of this world, is the

40
00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:24,949
ultimate end of all spiritual growth all over,
in every religion, through every great incarnations

41
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,300
and prophets.

42
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:38,300
What They indicated about future, what They
talked about, what you are to know yourself,

43
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:53,639
that you have to find yourself, that you have
to become a realised-soul, that you should

44
00:14:54,269 --> 00:15:01,269
have atmasakshatkar, that you should be a
wali. All these indications....Even the Buddhists

45
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:16,790
know that Matreya has to come. Ma-treya. “Ma”
is Mother. Three times. Trigunatmika. Even

46
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:24,970
the Greeks had Athena with 3 powers in Her.
So, all of them have been predicting about

47
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:34,970
this time. And that time came and that’s
how I call it the blossom time and the fruits

48
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,269
that are you people.

49
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:49,269
So it is all so much, we can say, in the cosmic
cycle of different seasons - [that] this beautiful

50
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:02,759
time has come and, like the wheel of time,
has to turn and go further - [that] Sahaja

51
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:13,410
Yoga started. Of course, in a very small way,
but has now grown so big all over the world.

52
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:21,389
Here now, there’s another thing that has
happened, which is rather remarkable, that

53
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:36,920
so far, people used to meditate alone and
maybe one of them might get realisation, but

54
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:46,730
there was no phenomena of en masse realisation,
nor of en masse meditation in those days.

55
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:52,769
They all used to disappear into some nook
and corner of a quiet place where they would

56
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:59,769
sit down and meditate. But this en masse realisation,
en masse meditation, en masse understanding

57
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:12,829
and learning about your being was not even
imagined by Me: that it would go to such a

58
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:24,309
limit, to such an extent, with leaps and bounds.
This year specially, it has taken a very new

59
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:34,039
dimension, I think, everywhere and all that
is negative is being exposed in most of the

60
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,320
countries.

61
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:47,320
So this is how, when the Sahastrara opened,
the Kundalini started moving towards this

62
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:57,280
Divine Power, getting connected with It and
was all the time flowing within you, when

63
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:11,490
the nirvikalpa state came. Now when it is
coming through the Sahastrara, one has to

64
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:21,590
know that the Sahastrara has to be clean,
so that the flow of Divine Power is going,

65
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:36,610
penetrating, without any obstacle, without
getting impure, without getting into any kind

66
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:51,919
of problems. So, to get to 
that level, to that state, all the sahaja
yogi, I am happy to know, are trying to work

67
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:11,020
it out, their own individual meditations also,
so that this growth should take place.

68
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:23,240
Thus, you get enlightenment in a full way.
But then one must ask why, for what? What’s

69
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:35,030
the purpose? What’s the aim? The aim is:
your aim is lost. You don’t seek for aims

70
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:47,820
at all anymore. This pendal was built with
such great ability for which we didn't pay

71
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:03,520
anything. Everybody was working here day and
night, in the rainy season, and I was quite

72
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:10,400
worried about them. I said, “What's the
matter?” they said, “We are enjoying,

73
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,080
Mother. We are enjoying!” “What enjoying?”
“We’re enjoying the rain.” All right.

74
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,679
“We are enjoying the cold.” All right.
“Enjoying everything, lifting all these

75
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:26,090
heavy things, everything we are enjoying.”
I was quite surprised at them. Nobody had

76
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:33,090
any complaints, but everybody was just on
the warpath, building this tent for you.

77
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:44,210
So what happens? Once your Sahastrara is clean,
this flow of joy doesn't allow you even to

78
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:53,320
think that you are exerting or you are working.
Normally, if you tell somebody that this is

79
00:20:53,320 --> 00:21:00,320
to be erected [they say] “Aaaaaah!” Some
would faint and some would say, “Ah, this

80
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:09,140
will take at least one year.” Then they'll
start giving excuses. “This pole is no good.

81
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:14,350
That is no good. It won't stand that. There’s
nothing, there's nothing…” Ultimately,

82
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:20,549
you'll find nothing is done. It will lie like
this for years together. “You better get

83
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:27,530
another person. You better buy another one.”
Everything is postponed all the time and nothing

84
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,020
is done.

85
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:36,020
But here, you don't feel you are doing anything.
When you don't feel you are doing anything,

86
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:41,640
how can you say then, “Why?” Because I'm
not doing anything, in any way, so I don't

87
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:48,640
ask question “Why?” Do I? And in any case,
I'm not doing anything. That is the state

88
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:58,720
where you are working in the Divine Plan.
You are doing lot of work, but nobody feels

89
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:14,750
they are doing anything. They all think, we
are absolutely just enjoying ourselves, doing

90
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:22,260
nothing. This kind of a state is the blessing
of Sahastrara because only in your brain you

91
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:32,130
think all these things; labour-saving devices.
I mean, you tell anybody, “You go and telephone

92
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:38,200
to this person.” Immediately, if it is a
modern man, he'll say, “He may not be there.

93
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:44,539
God knows. What’s the use? Telephone may
not be all right.” “Baba, you see! Why

94
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:49,480
don't you see if the telephone is all right
or not?” Before that only he will give this

95
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:56,480
hundred and one explanations that it may not
be all right, it maybe something may be wrong

96
00:22:56,539 --> 00:23:03,539
and just labour-saving, first. That is one
of the tricks of the brain.

97
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:10,220
Then this intelligence cheats you all the
time. It gives you rationality for everything.

98
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:17,220
Like a person kills his father and you ask
him, “Why did you kill?” “Why not? He

99
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:24,299
was so old. He was suffering and I wanted
to have all the property, so I thought better

100
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:31,320
kill him” Like Queen Victoria became very
old, so her son was to think that “I'll

101
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:36,419
never become a king if this lady goes on like
this!”

102
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:43,419
So, the brain starts giving lots of explanation
and cheating – because rationality. It gives

103
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:55,450
rationality and rationality is nothing but
ego or your conditioning. Your ego tells you,

104
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:04,039
“No, this is no good,” so you stick on
to that point, “This is not good.” Then

105
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:11,039
another can ask you why it is not good. “I
think it is not good, so I think.” Or, like

106
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:18,789
some say, “I believe,” but why? But in
Sahaja Yoga answer is simple, “Why do you

107
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:27,279
do it?” - “I enjoy it.” What's the next
answer? “Why are you worried? I am enjoying

108
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:32,370
it.”

109
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:39,370
Now the people who also say like that, because
of their conditionings, “Oh, I am enjoying

110
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:44,880
it.” Somebody will say, “I enjoy my drink.”
Somebody can say, “I enjoy my going to the

111
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,970
church.” Sometimes I say going – something
else, you see, like that. They are enjoying

112
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:56,860
something, which, according to Sahaja Yoga,
we too can never enjoy. But that enjoyment

113
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:03,860
is not collective. That is not supported by
anyone. For example, somebody says, “I enjoy

114
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:13,210
drinking.” Nobody has erected any temple
or any statue of a man who drinks. Have you

115
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:21,510
seen anywhere in the whole world? So, though
he may say that, “I enjoy,” it has no

116
00:25:25,169 --> 00:25:32,169
sanction from the society. People can say,
“I enjoy stealing,” people can say, “I

117
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:43,559
enjoy killing,” but it is very arbitrary,
it is very individual and never supported

118
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:52,020
by the society, even by the modern society
and there's always reaction to it.

119
00:25:53,370 --> 00:26:00,370
But Sahaja Yoga is not like them, when you
say, “I enjoy,” you say it because you

120
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:08,260
have no ego and you have no conditionings.
It's a different situation because now the

121
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:16,330
Sahastrara is opened out. So, on one side,
your ego has gone down, another side, your

122
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:25,110
conditioning is finished. You are no more
conditioned. Like you talk to a Catholic...so

123
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:33,080
I started talking about Christ. Immediately
he said, “Mother, now please.” I said,

124
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:39,690
“I am talking about Christ, not about Catholicism.
Talking of Christ, why are you frightened

125
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:44,620
about?” “Mother, we shouldn't become Catholic
again, you know. That's why we are worried

126
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:44,929
about.”

127
00:26:44,929 --> 00:26:51,929
Babaa! Christ never started Catholicism. So
much so, they have developed a kind of a de-conditioning

128
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:59,940
of their minds, that they start seeing that
whatever these people have done so far was

129
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:09,190
wrong and that "Whatever I have done so far
was absolutely wrong and I'm not going do

130
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:16,440
it." It's a very common thing. I have seen
the people who have worshipped Christ prefer

131
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,529
to worship Ganesha and those who have worshipped
Ganesha prefer to worship Christ. [They are]

132
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:27,720
just the same, the name is different, but
just the same, but they like it: because [to

133
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:34,720
them] Christ means the priest, the confessions,
rosaries and also cemeteries. So they don't

134
00:27:38,929 --> 00:27:45,929
want to have. These conditionings, itself,
start showing their own forms, like devils,

135
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:58,350
and sahaja yogis want to avoid it, or have
nothing to do with them.

136
00:27:59,669 --> 00:28:06,140
I remember in the beginning, we had about
six, seven hippies from England and they had

137
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:12,320
come to Rahuri. We were having a program and
there were five, six real hippies. These were

138
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,960
hippies [who] became sahaja yogis, real hippies
came to the program. I was just sitting like

139
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:24,960
this and suddenly they said, “Ooooh nooooo!”
I said, “What has happened?” I started

140
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:32,480
saying; as if some snake has entered or what
has happened? They were hippies, but with

141
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:40,289
this de-conditioning of the conditions, they
just couldn't bear those same hippies - that

142
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:47,679
they [once] were - coming inside. Because
you start seeing clearly, very clearly, that

143
00:28:54,669 --> 00:29:01,669
all these conditionings had blinded us completely
and misled us into a wilderness.

144
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:13,010
Of course, about ego, in the West people are
extremely conscious. There was a leader’s

145
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:19,549
wife. I said, “Why don't you help your husband?”
She said, “Mother, I’m worried about my

146
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:24,490
ego.” I said, “Why?” “If I start doing
some work, this ego might develop again, so

147
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:31,490
I'm rather worried.” They are so conscious
of it, that this ego should not come back.

148
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:40,770
One fellow who came to Me and I was talking
to him, then he just ran away. I said, “What

149
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:46,940
happened?” So he said, “No, those people
who go close to Mother always develop very

150
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:53,940
bad ego. So I don't want to be there close
with Her.” So, is a such … (laughing)...

151
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:02,520
such a mind that sees madness, that sees insanity,
that sees immaturity, it sees vulgarity, it

152
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:12,919
sees deceit, hypocrisy, everything so clearly:
and in that state, he gets confused and quite

153
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:21,179
upset, wants to run away from everyone.

154
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:28,179
Then we have some sahaja yogis who have such
problems, who come to Sahaja Yoga with problems.

155
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:35,870
Then, these people see them with these problems
they are still continuing. Now the Sahastrara

156
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:42,600
doesn't want to accept it. “It's terrible.
I was like him. No, no, no more. Me, I don't

157
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:49,600
want to be like that.” So, they abhor the
person who was just like them; they just can't

158
00:30:54,149 --> 00:31:01,149
bear him, they just can't tolerate. Then I
would say still you have to grow. You have

159
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:12,490
to grow, your Sahastrara has to be cleansed
out at such a speed, at such a level and stage

160
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:23,600
that, like soap cleanses everything, it should
cleanse everything else, should not be afraid

161
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:31,860
of anything, should not have any worry about
the conditionings of others or ego of others:

162
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:37,090
that is the state now we have to reach.

163
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:44,090
Today is the Sahastrara Day, is the 23rd Sahastrara
Day and I shouldn't expect much, I don't want

164
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:57,450
to say anything much about it: but I wish
and I hope that all the thousand petals of

165
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:06,460
your Sahastraras will be so cleansed that
you will never catch from anybody; you will

166
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:13,460
never be frightened of anybody. You will be
masters of all kinds of curatives and also

167
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:26,500
you will be the one who can give solace, peace
to others; you will be the one who’ll be

168
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:37,830
organising programs outside, you will the
one who will be responsible for Sahaja Yoga.

169
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:49,669
And when that happens, then we can see that
these thousand petals of the Sahastrara have

170
00:32:55,350 --> 00:33:01,700
opened out.

171
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:08,700
These thousand petals are not yet awakened.
They signify the different thousand powers

172
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:25,279
of the Goddess, minimum of minimum. These
thousand ones you can open out yourself by

173
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:40,380
introspection, by looking at yourself, making
fun of yourself.

174
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:48,450
“Know Thyself” means know yourself with
all the defects you have and also the potential

175
00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:57,059
you have and all the good points you have.
So as far as you are concerned, when you are

176
00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:03,580
looking at yourself you should just see to
the defects that you have. “Why do I behave

177
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:10,580
like this? Why do I assert so much? What's
the problem? Why can't I see myself clearly?”

178
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:24,020
With that transparency of your Sahastrara,
you can see your heart, you can see your mind,

179
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:33,679
you can see yourself fully, clearly, what's
wrong with you. This transparency can come

180
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:45,020
only if you have really the pure desire, shuddha
iccha, to be 
of that level. Now, there is no competition

181
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:08,430
between A and B. We don't say that, “You
got the first prize for coming out of the

182
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Sahastrara” (laughing) or we don't say,
“You have the second prize.” There's nothing

183
00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:26,109
like first, second in Sahaja Yoga, because
we are not running the race. There’s no

184
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:37,130
competition between us. Whatever we are doing
is for our own satisfaction. Now think of

185
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:44,480
something. There are five people who are running.
Now they have to think, out of these five

186
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:51,480
people, who goes first. Here it is the other
way round: The five people are meditating;

187
00:35:55,140 --> 00:36:02,140
now everyone individually has to see for himself
if he satisfies himself or not, nobody else

188
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:10,619
is going to give you a certificate. It is
you who has to give certificate to yourself,

189
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:15,550
honestly. It's a very different position.

190
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:22,550
It is you, your Sahastrara and your attention
and you have to see, within yourself, “How

191
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:31,900
far have I realised my own powers, my own
compassion, my own personality?” You’ll

192
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:47,849
have to test it yourself. It is you are the
one who decides. When you are the one who

193
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:59,240
is running, it is you are the one who decides
without running, then what is the question

194
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:09,060
of competition? The whole thing disappears
into nothing.

195
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:21,810
As I told you the other day, an analogy that,
if you are looking at the mirror, then you

196
00:37:26,089 --> 00:37:33,089
are the one who is observing, your reflection
is the one that is observed and there is the

197
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:41,290
action of seeing, so you are in 3 dimensions.
But supposing you become the mirror yourself,

198
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:54,320
the whole process is reversed: You see yourself.
You don't have to see because you are seeing

199
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:05,640
it all the time, it's just spontaneous. In
the same manner, when it comes to Sahastrara,

200
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:15,140
it is your Sahastrara itself gives you the
full idea as to how you are. The diagnosis

201
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:22,410
comes from your own Sahastrara. Your own Sahastrara
tells you what centres are catching because

202
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:30,290
all the peethas of these seven centres are
in the Sahastrara. As if the Sahastrara is

203
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:40,060
now watching yourself and reporting to you,
“See, this is wrong with you. This is wrong

204
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:47,570
with you, this is wrong with you.” So, Sahastrara
being the best well-wisher that you have,

205
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:54,240
gives you the right information about yourself,
so the best is that you correct yourself.

206
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:01,240
So then, achieve that perfect state: that
is what you have to do. But once you have

207
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:10,060
achieved the perfect state, you have achieved
your aim, you have no aim left. Like the lights

208
00:39:10,869 --> 00:39:17,700
now, till you have to make the lights, you
had to work hard, make the lights, put them

209
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:24,700
right, do everything that is necessary. But
once it is made and the light comes into it,

210
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:32,960
then the job of the light is to give the light.
So the first function is over.

211
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:46,790
Now the second function is to give it back.

212
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:56,470
You reach your aim, your destination. For
example, I had to come here. Alright? So I

213
00:39:56,470 --> 00:40:03,470
come all the way from My house, come in the
car, walking and come and sit down here. Now

214
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:11,950
it’s finished that part, over. Now I don'
t have to walk, otherwise I’ll be all the

215
00:40:12,819 --> 00:40:19,819
time running. So, all this mad race of this
brain stops. For what should it be used now?

216
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:34,430
For enjoying the peace, for enjoying the joy,
for enjoying the collectivity. So, the labour

217
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:46,990
or the hard work or you can also say the planning
of the future finishes off. Only thing now

218
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:52,730
you have got it, so better enjoy it.

219
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:59,730
It’s like you are coming from outside, you
are running, you are very hungry, you want

220
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:11,960
to reach home. Once you reach home, then the
food is served to you. Now what's your aim?

221
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:20,510
Nothing, but to enjoy the food for which you
were running. But after that also, if you

222
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:27,510
start running, then one should say it is absolute
stupidity! But the capacity of enjoyment only

223
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:38,420
comes when your Sahastrara is absolutely open.
Otherwise the capacity to enjoy is much less

224
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:50,790
and you become like a person who is running
all the time after something which you never

225
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:57,790
achieve. There are many like that. All their
lives they’re like mad, you know. They are

226
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:06,220
working morning till evening, everyday, achieving
nothing! Next day again get up, again running!

227
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:14,859
All their lives running like this till their
foot is in the grave, they are still running.

228
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:24,099
But after getting to Sahaja Yoga, you stop
all these activities and leave it to your

229
00:42:26,329 --> 00:42:33,329
Sahaja Yoga to work, to your Sahastrara to
work it out. And it works out. You don't have

230
00:42:36,579 --> 00:42:42,099
to rush. You don't have to be so competent.
You don't have to write down everything. You

231
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:49,099
don't have to think of planning everything.
Just everything works out and it works out

232
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:55,950
beautifully. The only thing that one has to
do is to accept whatever is happening for

233
00:42:55,950 --> 00:43:02,950
our good. Even in small, small things. For
today's delay in the puja, is the desire of

234
00:43:08,369 --> 00:43:15,369
some people who wanted to give you some sort
of a … I shouldn't say that, but some secret

235
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:23,690
show was going to be there and they didn't
want any light. So they were thinking, “What

236
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:27,650
will happen – the puja will be over by about
five, then by six o'clock they’ll eat their

237
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:33,880
food, but the sun would be there till nine
o'clock, then how can we show this?” All

238
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:38,890
right, so have it in the night.

239
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:45,890
In every small thing you will see. Some people
were coming from India and they had to bring

240
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:53,190
My two boxes from there and they wouldn't
allow these boxes, they said it is overweight,

241
00:43:53,369 --> 00:43:57,640
overweight. So they didn't know what to do.
They thought that they should send them back

242
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:04,640
and later on it can go till Guru puja or somewhere.
But they thought that there must be some plan,

243
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:13,270
must be some drama. The plane was late [by]
19 hours, so they thought there must be some

244
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:20,630
drama; and then they were put into some sort
of a tourist hotel for that night. Next morning

245
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:32,119
they met two other Indians from, sahaja yogis,
from Poona, two boys. That settled it! My

246
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:47,440
luggage, they could put it in their name and
that’s how the luggage came in. But they

247
00:44:48,329 --> 00:44:55,329
never felt bored: 19 hours. “We had nice
time, Mother, together. We were enjoying and

248
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:01,470
talking,” finished! Nobody feels the time
is passing out. Otherwise, anybody else would

249
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:08,470
have eaten up all the airport personnel and
would have broken all the telephones. Waiting

250
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:16,780
for 19hours, “My God, what is this!!”
Would have given it in the newspapers. Everybody

251
00:45:16,999 --> 00:45:23,630
… this is the greatest crime! While these
were enjoying life nicely.

252
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:30,630
So, we have lost now the sense of aim. We
don't have any aims. We just want to enjoy.

253
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:40,119
It’s a very, very big thing that has happened
because, as you know, the joy in the Sahastrara

254
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:52,130
is nira-ananda, nira-ananda. Of course, Nira
is My name also, but it means pure absolute

255
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:05,220
joy. Nira-ananda. And that nirananda, that
joy has no other hues. It’s just pure, pure

256
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:19,010
joy. Without thinking, it just pours into
it. After all, every activity is for what,

257
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:28,230
for getting some sort of a pleasure, sensation
and also, some people believe, for joy. It’s

258
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:30,230
not.

259
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:35,060
Only after the opening of Sahastrara and the
cleansing of it, then you will know what is

260
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:35,589
joy.

261
00:46:35,589 --> 00:46:42,410
You can't explain it, how you can spend hours
together like this. People don't understand.

262
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:47,970
Like even our mayor was telling Me that, “We
can't sit in the church for more than fifteen

263
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:54,970
minutes. And how people are sitting here for
so many hours. Fifteen minutes we cannot sit,

264
00:46:56,170 --> 00:47:02,960
but how these people are sitting for such
a long time. What are they doing there? What

265
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:08,810
is their entertainment? How can they sit for
hours together, without saying anything, without

266
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:15,810
dropping even a pin, they are just all the
time there. So what have you given them? What

267
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:22,890
is happening to them?” This is very surprising
and remarkable that these people, who are

268
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:31,170
not even sahaja yogis, can see clearly that
you people are least bothered, you are absolutely

269
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:38,170
enjoying life. Whatever you may be doing is
not important, what is important is that,

270
00:47:38,849 --> 00:47:45,849
whether you are working in the office or outside,
you are full of joy, enjoying everything.

271
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:54,260
This is the most important thing in life,
which you can have only through Sahaja Yoga,

272
00:47:54,849 --> 00:48:00,720
because your Sahastraras are open, because
they are opened out.

273
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:07,720
There is now one more thing I have to tell
you, that is very important for all of you

274
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:15,460
to remember: that, while living in this Ocean
of Joy, we have to remember that there are

275
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:27,420
many who have not yet jumped into it, so we
have to bring them in; and it’s such a pleasure,

276
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:35,240
such a joy to give realisation to someone,
extremely joyful.

277
00:48:35,319 --> 00:48:42,319
So we need people who would come and say that
“We’ll definitely come for this [work].”

278
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:52,400
I mean, they should really come forward and,
once they come forward, you'll be amazed how

279
00:48:56,030 --> 00:49:03,030
things will work out. There are many, I know,
who are going all over, everywhere and spreading

280
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:12,130
Sahaja Yoga. So is very important for all
of you to know that you have got the light

281
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:19,630
to be given to others. Come forward. Don't
have fear of your ego, conditionings, nothing.

282
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:26,059
Come forward. You have all the strength, you
have everything within yourself and you will

283
00:49:26,059 --> 00:49:32,640
do everything with such happiness and joy.
Everywhere, in every country people are doing

284
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:37,680
that, but some of them are doing, some of
them are not doing. All of you are quite capable

285
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:44,680
of doing it, so please come forward and see
for yourself what you are capable of.

286
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:54,200
First of all you should have faith in yourself.
If you have no faith in yourself, you cannot

287
00:49:54,200 --> 00:50:01,200
do anything. Have faith. You should have no
fears of any kind. And also to introspect,

288
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:11,940
to see within yourself what's going on. To
be very frank, I find My brain absolutely

289
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:22,780
empty. What I talk from this emptiness, I
don't know. You will also find your brain

290
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:29,780
absolutely empty, and still with that empty
brain, you will be achieving a lot.

291
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:37,800
It’s very remarkable, as you have seen,
that from the candle you get cool breeze.

292
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:44,800
How you can get it from the candle, cool breeze?
You do get.

293
00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:52,109
So, is important to recognise yourself as
a Sahaja yogi and to recognise - what have

294
00:50:57,859 --> 00:51:04,859
you done for Sahaja Yoga? Without doing for
Sahaja Yoga, you cannot enjoy life. That was

295
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:14,450
your aim and that aim you have reached. Now,
if you don't...supposing I have to come and

296
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:18,650
sit on this thing and I don't sit on this
thing, then what's the use of coming here?

297
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:25,650
I came here to tell you something about Sahastrara
and if I don't tell you, then what's the use

298
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:33,359
of My coming here and celebrating Sahastrara
Day? In the same way, when you have reached

299
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:38,710
that state now, what you have to do is not
to use for your own purpose. You have used

300
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:44,730
it, quite a lot, for your health, wealth,
everything. Now what are we doing about Sahaja

301
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:51,730
Yoga? What have we done for Sahaja Yoga? After
some time, you will do a lot and you will

302
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:58,839
never know you have done anything for Sahaja
Yoga. Very surprising, it happens to so many

303
00:51:58,839 --> 00:52:05,839
of you and should happen to all of you. I
hope all of you will realise that your Sahastraras

304
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:13,890
are cleaned, completely. You are perfectly
alright. You don't have to worry about it

305
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:20,890
and you can really go ahead with spreading

306
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:05,650
of 

307
01:09:11,219 --> 01:09:18,219
Sahaja Yoga.

308
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:13,340
May God bless you all.
