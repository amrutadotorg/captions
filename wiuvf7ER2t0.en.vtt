00:06:12.475 --> 00:06:22.891
Today we have all been waiting to celebrate
the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:06:25.942 --> 00:06:33.284
There's so much significant that we are
in a place here,

00:06:34.257 --> 00:06:45.106
the same type of a hut Jesus had when He
was born,

00:06:45.715 --> 00:06:48.770
and the wind was blowing from all sides

00:06:48.971 --> 00:06:57.330
and it was difficult to keep the room very
warm,

00:06:57.531 --> 00:07:05.511
though if it is correct He was not born
in the month of December,

00:07:05.712 --> 00:07:12.746
in a warmer month, not so very cold, maybe
this much as you see;

00:07:12.947 --> 00:07:20.666
so maybe that the climate of today is quite
significant, with the climate

00:07:21.405 --> 00:07:25.039
that He must have felt.

00:07:26.675 --> 00:07:30.411
As for you people, you don't feel any
discomfort in this climate,

00:07:30.612 --> 00:07:36.619
nor in these surroundings nor in the Spartan
living.

00:07:36.899 --> 00:07:41.749
He never felt any discomfort, nor
His Mother.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.962
When our attention is on our Spirit,

00:07:47.163 --> 00:07:59.704
then we do not feel the discomfort of nature
or of worldly things.

00:07:59.905 --> 00:08:08.006
This is the first sign when a Sahaja Yogi
starts

00:08:09.676 --> 00:08:14.089
complaining about comforts,

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:20.161
then the first sign is that he is not
a Sahaja Yogi as yet.

00:08:20.362 --> 00:08:31.128
To begin with you just get absolutely
acclimatized with the climate and enjoy

00:08:34.081 --> 00:08:41.332
the style, the speed, the way it is molding
you.

00:08:41.533 --> 00:08:48.964
There's no friction between the nature and
the body because the Spirit

00:08:49.165 --> 00:08:55.827
which is synchronizer, helps you to become
one

00:08:56.028 --> 00:09:01.032
with this nature and enjoy the best part
of it.

00:09:01.233 --> 00:09:05.622
The way you are enjoying it shows that you
are great Sahaja Yogis,

00:09:05.823 --> 00:09:08.013
and that goes to My credit, I think,

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:16.073
that you people have accepted all
the discomfort as enjoyments.

00:09:18.199 --> 00:09:22.172
Christ coming was a great event as I have
told you

00:09:22.373 --> 00:09:31.245
to establish Agnya Chakra. And He was born
on this Earth

00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:35.936
but much before He was born
in the consciousness

00:09:36.137 --> 00:09:44.949
and that absolute consciousness itself took
birth as Jesus Christ.

00:09:45.203 --> 00:09:49.855
To explain His life is only possible if you
are Realized souls,

00:09:50.056 --> 00:09:55.853
otherwise you cannot explain Christ - what
He was, how He worked -

00:09:56.054 --> 00:10:02.457
still it's very difficult to explain many
things in Sahaja Yoga as you know,

00:10:02.658 --> 00:10:08.429
you just go on seeing things. Today you
saw fountains

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:12.222
coming out of the lake, which nobody can
explain,

00:10:12.423 --> 00:10:16.884
even the engineer said that they can't
explain, nobody can explain it.

00:10:17.085 --> 00:10:22.624
It just happens that the water gets
excited, feels the Divinity

00:10:22.825 --> 00:10:28.323
and starts pouring out its love in a bubbly
manner.

00:10:28.524 --> 00:10:31.928
Can you imagine that even the water can
feel it?

00:10:32.129 --> 00:10:38.763
You have seen how the light can feel it,
in the same way every element can feel it.

00:10:38.964 --> 00:10:43.040
All those elements are within us,
the highest of all,

00:10:43.241 --> 00:10:49.407
as we say, is the light,

00:10:50.379 --> 00:10:57.320
because light has an effect and that is
governed by Jesus Christ.

00:10:57.521 --> 00:11:05.112
Light has an effect, light shows things
that are correct.

00:11:05.313 --> 00:11:13.388
That's the one which makes us understand
all the dimensions of worldly things

00:11:13.589 --> 00:11:22.031
and ultimately when this light comes from
the Spirit and is enlightened by the Spirit,

00:11:22.232 --> 00:11:28.760
then you start seeing the other dimensions
also which sometimes make you laugh,

00:11:28.961 --> 00:11:35.277
sometimes make you smile and sometimes
make you cry also.

00:11:35.831 --> 00:11:42.336
Such a beautiful new dimension you have
achieved through Sahaja Yoga,

00:11:42.537 --> 00:11:47.212
but it was all built in within you and you
had to achieve it.

00:11:47.413 --> 00:11:52.467
People on the other side had to work very
hard,

00:11:52.668 --> 00:11:59.612
like Jesus Christ was born in a small manger
to show

00:11:59.813 --> 00:12:04.282
that Divinity need not be born in royal
families,

00:12:04.483 --> 00:12:08.412
can be born in a manger,

00:12:08.633 --> 00:12:13.036
can be born anywhere, makes no difference
to the Divinity.

00:12:13.237 --> 00:12:21.448
But that has given some funny ideas
to people, that they are saying

00:12:21.649 --> 00:12:28.677
we should make ourselves miserable

00:12:28.878 --> 00:12:35.685
and we should give away everything to God.
God doesn't want anything.

00:12:35.886 --> 00:12:40.472
He cannot have anything, and you cannot
give anything.

00:12:40.673 --> 00:12:45.273
Is a wrong idea that you become like
a pauper and give everything to God.

00:12:45.474 --> 00:12:53.899
He doesn't want that. What He wants that
you have to be happy, joyous and enjoying.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.112
That's the main point.

00:12:56.313 --> 00:13:02.042
Also if you give a little bit, very little
bit to God,

00:13:02.243 --> 00:13:05.045
then He gives you hundred times more.

00:13:05.246 --> 00:13:09.209
That's why you have to give a very wee bit
to God.

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:12.862
But you don't have to hang yourself
by the trees

00:13:13.063 --> 00:13:16.891
to prove that you want to sacrifice.

00:13:17.092 --> 00:13:21.232
Christ has done everything for you. That's
the beauty of His life is

00:13:21.433 --> 00:13:27.016
that from the very beginning of His birth
He has shown that He has enjoyed

00:13:27.217 --> 00:13:34.746
no material well-being, as we call it.

00:13:34.947 --> 00:13:44.140
He has not enjoyed any worldly things as we
know of

00:13:46.354 --> 00:13:51.227
but that just means that He has done that
for us to see

00:13:51.428 --> 00:13:56.912
that there is no need for us to hanker
after worldly things -

00:13:57.113 --> 00:14:01.433
they will hanker after us. You don't have
to worry about these things.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:06.229
What you have to worry is the Spirit,
the main thing.

00:14:07.501 --> 00:14:15.357
All His life, which was very short I should
say, He has been trying,

00:14:15.558 --> 00:14:23.138
He was very much interested in evaluating
people

00:14:23.701 --> 00:14:27.602
because He didn't know what sort of things
these human beings are.

00:14:27.803 --> 00:14:35.175
He was a foreigner for these human beings.
So He tried to evaluate

00:14:35.376 --> 00:14:38.606
and in that evaluation

00:14:39.193 --> 00:14:46.694
He said many things which are very
remarkable, and one has to understand.

00:14:48.162 --> 00:14:53.464
One of the things He said that don't throw
your pearls before people

00:14:53.665 --> 00:15:00.662
who do not want to understand you. For
Sahaja Yogis it is important to understand

00:15:00.863 --> 00:15:06.009
that you should not talk about Sahaja Yoga
to people who are anti-God.

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:09.077
Now he may be your brother, may be your
sister, may be your father,

00:15:09.278 --> 00:15:14.518
may be anyone, there is no need to convince
them about Sahaja Yoga

00:15:14.832 --> 00:15:19.045
because they are not your relations.

00:15:19.873 --> 00:15:22.695
Many people have only this worry how
to convince my husband

00:15:22.896 --> 00:15:29.650
or how to convince my brother, there is
no need at all for you to work it out,

00:15:32.194 --> 00:15:36.163
just give them up on this point.

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:41.332
The another thing He has told us which is
very important, I think,

00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:44.864
that we must forgive.

00:15:45.381 --> 00:15:50.228
He has given the greatest weapon that we
must forgive.

00:15:50.588 --> 00:15:54.321
Now it's such a practical thing to forgive.

00:15:54.522 --> 00:15:58.882
If you just forgive, the person doesn't
exist anymore

00:15:59.083 --> 00:16:04.518
and the person doesn't trouble you anymore,
nor is he in your attention,

00:16:04.719 --> 00:16:11.060
just to forgive is a simplest thing to do
and the highest thing to do

00:16:11.234 --> 00:16:20.228
to get relief from worldly or mental
tortures that we get.

00:16:21.692 --> 00:16:30.274
His life has been a story of spirituality,

00:16:30.475 --> 00:16:35.904
going through all kinds of turmoils and
tortures,

00:16:36.105 --> 00:16:41.148
all types of troubles that the Spirit can
go through,

00:16:41.317 --> 00:16:47.482
to show that nobody can kill that Spirit,

00:16:47.683 --> 00:16:53.891
as it’s said in the Gita: "Nainam chidanti
shastrani, nainam dahati pavakah,

00:16:54.092 --> 00:16:58.063
na chainam kledayantya apo, na shosayati
marutah".

00:16:58.264 --> 00:17:00.923
It cannot be killed, it's an eternal life

00:17:01.124 --> 00:17:04.428
and He tried to prove through His life
the eternity,

00:17:04.629 --> 00:17:10.861
from the beginning to the end He showed
that Spirit is above matter,

00:17:11.062 --> 00:17:15.225
that nothing can dominate Spirit.

00:17:15.426 --> 00:17:19.530
It's a very big thing He has done for us is
to create

00:17:19.731 --> 00:17:28.516
such a big confidence in our Spirit.

00:17:29.193 --> 00:17:31.971
He has proved it beyond doubt.

00:17:32.172 --> 00:17:37.284
I hope you people will understand and will
not bother Me or bother yourself

00:17:37.485 --> 00:17:42.991
with small petty things here and there,
is nothing important.

00:17:43.811 --> 00:17:53.826
Ask for bigger things, eternal things,
valuable things.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.424
Also I am very happy that you like this
place

00:17:58.625 --> 00:18:00.571
and you are enjoying yourself here very
much

00:18:00.772 --> 00:18:03.523
and today we have declared so many
marriages.

00:18:03.724 --> 00:18:06.634
There have been so many events in this
short time.

00:18:06.835 --> 00:18:10.710
So I would like to bless you all for this
Christmas Eve

00:18:10.911 --> 00:18:14.288
and I wish you all very happy Christmas and
Happy New Year.
