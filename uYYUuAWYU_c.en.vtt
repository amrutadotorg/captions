1984-0702 The Experience of Truth (Part II), Hampstead, England

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.892
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.892
The other day I talked to you about the experience of truth.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.892
That the truth has to be felt through your central nervous system.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.892
If anything has to happen to your evolution you have to feel it through your central nervous

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:08.892
system otherwise it is just a projection of your mind which forms it and you are surprised

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:25.892
at yourself. Like we call somebody as a friend and one day we find there is no friendship.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.892
Maybe one day the friend will try to murder you or you may try to murder that person.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:48.892
You just don't understand what happened to that love. Same thing about all our projections, we find it has no basis, it's so superficial.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:59.892
When we realise that all is so superficial, it has no basis, we just get frustrated and

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.892
we start thinking, what is all this, we are playing games.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.892
One can't be sincere. What has happened to us?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.892
Why are we so frivolous? Why are we so superficial?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.892
We may start taking interest in things which look superficially very great, but ultimately

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:39.892
we find that it doesn't have any depth in it and suddenly to our horror we discover

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.892
that everything seems to be relative in this world, nothing is absolute.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.892
So the experience of the truth has to be absolute.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:03.892
Means everybody should feel that way, if not then it is something poetical because each

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.892
poet sees the reality in a different way, describes in a different way.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.892
But if he is a truthful poet he keeps the essence at least the same.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:27.892
But when we say we have to feel the truth, by everyone in an absolute manner, what does

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:43.892
that mean? That means when we get our self realisation, when we think we have got a new awareness

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:56.892
of collective consciousness, that means we are unconnected with the whole, with the absolute,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.892
then everyone of us who is like that should feel the same way.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:15.892
For example there's a person who is sick and you get ten children who are realised souls,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:26.892
that means we say are realised souls, now tie their eyes so that they cannot see at

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.892
all and ask them what centres are catching in this person.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.892
All of them will raise the same finger.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.892
This is the finger that is catching. And if you ask that person relative to that finger, have you got this trouble, he'll say

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.892
yes, but how do you know? How do these children know?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.892
So the truth is felt by everyone the same.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:11.892
Then it is absolute. If somebody sees a blue colour, if somebody sees a red colour then it is not the truth.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:21.892
And you'll be amazed when you become self realised, if you meet people who are self

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:31.892
realised, you'll be amazed they will say the same thing in a different way in a different , but they say the same.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:43.892
It is very amazing that people who were in India, who were in Lebanon, who were in China,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.892
who were in England had nothing to do with each other, had no communication what so ever

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.892
and they say the same thing.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:05.892
So down within us there is something that is absolute that tells us about absolute.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.892
So the second experience should be of absoluteness.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:25.892
The Divine power that is all pervading, if it is truthful, if it is real, then all of

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:34.892
us who are feeling that power through this realisation should receive the same message

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:43.892
as this is the second proof of and you put this

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:55.892
test to anyone who says that this is self realisation.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:06.892
This is a very, very important thing for you to understand that truth has to be one, it

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.892
has to be absolute and if you can establish your report with the absolute you cannot have

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:32.892
any other information but the truth. So as you ascend in Sahaja Yoga you start learning that what ever messages you are getting

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:42.892
is the truth, that all these messages that you are receiving you can your self perceive

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.892
them, can feel them, nobody has to tell you. Even a child can sense it.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:02.892
So you move one step forward into a world call faith, which is the faith of experience.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:11.892
You call say this now, how do you know it is not artificial?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.892
It is real because you have experience of the artificial; and the real and now when

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:26.892
you feel it you can say with faith "yes it is real".

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:42.892
In the same way reality can only be accepted if you go through the experience of truth

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.892
and then have faith.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.892
Human mind is a very wonderful mind.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:06.892
English word mind doesn't explain much though what mind is but in Sahaja Yoga it has been

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:23.892
very clearly explained what human mind creates. Here you see very clearly that on top of the head there, you see a lotus.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.892
You can say how can there be a lotus on top of the head Mother, this sounds very poetic

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:44.892
and something fantastic and even fantasy of course I wish everybody had that lotus blooming.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.892
But very few have it but still they have no doubt.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:59.892
Now this one, when you see the lotus, before that if you see the brain in Sahaja Yoga is

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:07.892
just shown as a hollow thing. There's nothing like brain tissue and all that.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:30.892
But there are two, one is blue the other is yellow [somebody show John, somebody], two

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.892
balloon like structures in the brain.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:48.892
Now when the first balloon only existed, when we were just animals our brain was flat, so

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.892
was the Himalayas. Himalayas represents our brain in the gross life.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.892
So the Himalaya was also flat and our brain was also flat.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:19.892
Then man started hitting with branches when the animals attacked them, they (learned)

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:29.892
how to hit back and another line started which we call as the sun line but we see another

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:43.892
side started developing and the brain got transformed into a new formation of a triangular

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:51.892
thing. This triangular brain, now is like a pyramid I've seen and sometimes I find it swollen

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:03.892
very much more on one side .... So all our problems started from that point

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.892
where we decided that we can do it.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:18.892
We.............................. and then we started doing it that way.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.892
This yellow stuff which we call as ego started pushing the superego in such a manner that

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:34.892
the brain became a prism like structure. But is was important this prism.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.892
The Himalayas also developed a triangular structure.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:52.892
It was very important that it should have happened in the human brain,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:08.892
that we had developed this ego within ourselves. We could have avoided it if we had not committed the mistake at the stage of Adam and Eve,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:16.892
but we did commit, and that short circuit got elongated and our

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:27.892
evolution started going on a different line where we wanted to find out ourselves what

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:36.892
is the truth.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:53.892
So a journey started and started moving so fast that they remain in the state of a balloon

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:05.892
, nothing else but a balloon exists. So we became nothing but balloons floating superficially.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:17.892
The balance was lost completely and the whole problem has started with this balloon, that

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:27.892
we have put in the effort, we can find , we can discover this.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:42.892
Like one scientist was forced by a King that he should try to create gold out of perfume,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:50.892
poor fellow he tried his level best he could not, but as a result he found out how to make

00:14:51.000 --> 00:15:02.892
beautiful china. That's exactly what has happened to human beings, in the search of truth we have discovered

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.892
everything else but the truth.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:17.892
Because truth you cannot discover, as I told you the other day it is a state that one has

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:33.892
to achieve, one has to achieve to receive the truth, to know the truth

00:15:34.000 --> 00:16:22.892
So some people felt that truth is what we have found, like blind people, what ever they

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.892
have found out they called it as truth.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:42.892
Even in India, where people have a great sense of meditation, people committed mistakes and

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:56.892
what they found is the movement on the right hand side and they said yes, there is all

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:06.892
pervading power and that is formless.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:21.892
The left hand people found while praying to God that there are forms so they talked of

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:33.892
the forms. Some talked of the formless and some talked of the form.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:45.892
The right sided people being the worshippers of the Goddess of learning wrote down everything

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.892
as Vedas [most ancient Hindu scriptures] but in the very beginning of Vedas, Vedas means

00:17:52.000 --> 00:18:07.892
to know, and to know means to evolve to become self realised. It is not when I talk to you what you know, is not, the knowledge is which is expressed,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.892
manifested on your central nervous system. The truth.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:26.892
So they wrote down what they found, that we have to first excite or initiate the nature.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:37.892
So they wrote all those things, now that has become an authentic writing, big for intellectuals,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.892
that to after many, many years people they knew it by heart.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:55.892
Authentically you might say that Vedas came only about 800 or something like that, all

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:07.892
that writing, if you go by that you'll be lost into another wild goose chase and those

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:14.892
who read only Vedas can never find that what is supposed to be known.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:21.892
In the first chapter or the first verse of the Vedas that by reading this book if you

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.892
do not get the knowledge no good reading Vedas.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:36.892
But there are books & books & books, libraries & libraries & libraries, all the wild goose

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:52.892
chase. Many of the systems follow, was the system of fearing the God, then finding out the forms

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.892
of God, worshipping God as form.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.892
The incarnations came on this earth and people worshipped them, like Christ.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.892
Now there is a challenge on Christ, these intellectuals will challenge everything because they challenge everything through the intellect.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:18.892
The trouble is that they think they are the wisest. Such wise people they have time for, is impossible.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.892
You have to be a little humble.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:32.892
So the intellectual as usual challenge and the others who just believe without intellectuals

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:45.892
were the people who just believed into things without knowing.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:53.892
Who had just faith, as our emotional songs are, are.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:02.892
All these extreme movements on both the sides created two different types of people, one

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:11.892
who we can call as intellectuals and another as

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:22.892
They did not create self realised people because ego makes a person so superficial and so stupid

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:31.892
that he cannot grasp, it's beyond him. He is so stupid. He cannot grasp the truth.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.892
Is a barrier, is a projection outside, he is a concave personality, is a convex personality.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:50.892
Brain is convex. And the other one is so concave, is so conditioned that you cannot compete.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:58.892
That's how the quality of seekers came on this earth, who are seeking truth.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:10.892
Now we should also know that God must be worried about his creation, he must be worried about

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:22.892
the people who are crated by him, who became human beings, who are seekers, special category.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:30.892
What hypocrites, you cannot tell people, you cannot help them but those who are real seekers.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:41.892
There are many real seekers and he must be worried about all these seekers and he must

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:49.892
have arranged something for them and that is how Christ came on this earth . He came

00:22:50.000 --> 00:23:02.892
on this earth to guide and tell us that you can find the truth by your second birth.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:10.892
You are to be born again. You are to be born again, then there are people who just believe that I am born again, you

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:21.892
see self opinionated, I'm alright! I've found it! Stupid people, they just believe, certify themselves they have found it.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:34.892
They just give themselves a certificate, oh I've found it, but who is the loser?

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:47.892
It's not God. He can reveal himself to you if you want to know him, through your evolution, through

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:56.892
your effortlessness.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:09.892
But as you have seen Patanjali for the real seekers but people took out of Patanjali also

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:19.892
what they tell them is the physical exercise, I mean just imagine, it is like a person who

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:27.892
has been invited to dinner to do dish-washing, it's that stupid.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:38.892
And that book, even today thank God, despite all the intellectuals attacks and all nonsense,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:48.892
he just talked of the formless not of the form so much but he does say that you have

00:24:49.000 --> 00:25:04.892
to neutralise your effort too, you have to neutralise your thought which are and in the

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:12.892
absence of that thought only the Kundalini will rise.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:38.892
Now a vicious circle is created, even when we say we fight with that thought

00:25:39.000 --> 00:26:04.892
a thought in the mind so something has to happen

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:14.892
and that is what happens but is all done by God Almighty within us,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:31.892
that he has made these beautiful chakras. They are made from different elements, the essence of different elements and all incarnations

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.892
of our ascent are placed there to guide those subtle centres.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:50.892
Is already within us, we may not know about it but they exist within us and ultimately

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:59.892
the residual, they call it, the residual power, that is Kundalini; it is residual because

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:10.892
it has created everything but has not manifested itself, is the pure desire to know the truth,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:17.892
pure desire to know the Divine, to become the Divine, is still sleeping.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:33.892
When these chakras are in proper shape it spontaneously rises just like a seed sprouts,

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:42.892
you don't have to do anything to reduce your efforts and your thoughts.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:49.892
Your thoughts are created and they disappear again they come up and disappear, there's

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:57.892
a little gap in between and that gap widens by the ascent of Kundalini and you become

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:06.892
thoughtless without any effort. With effort you cannot, that's the point.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:17.892
This mechanism exists within us. Now if something happens here say for example this is working out, then we go into the mechanism

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.892
of this and try to find out how this is working out.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:33.892
Now if you want to see, you can see the rising of the Kundalini, you can see the breaking

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:41.892
of the Kundalini, you can feel the cool breeze coming out of you.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:29:04.892
Now how it happens it is the cool breeze that emits on top of

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:13.892
your head, is the first sign that your Kundalini awakened and then when you start feeling it

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:23.892
all around now you are in connection with the all pervading power.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.892
Before that we are denying the truth.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:35.892
It's all done by God, by his grace, he's made it all so beautiful, so very, very beautiful,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.892
we don't do a thing, we don't have to do a thing, but that is the point, we cannot do,

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:52.892
that we don't have to do anything about it. Always they ask me, then what must we do, I said you don't do anything, that's the point.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:03.892
Is it too much to accept? But how do we become human beings from monkeys do we

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:11.892
for anything . How does a seed sprout?

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:23.892
By itself spontaneously. In the same way your evolution has to take place spontaneously.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:34.892
And every time somebody has to lead, somebody has to go forward, somebody has to be bold,

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.892
somebody has to conquer.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:48.892
Maybe somebody else would have been better for this job, as I said, I would be very happy

00:30:49.000 --> 00:31:00.892
to retire but that's what it is, it's true. I have to do this job, it is a thankless job no doubt but I have to do it, so what can

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:08.892
I do about it? That should not upset you.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:19.892
That upsets people but I don't do anything actually, it is a myth like the sun shines,

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:28.892
it doesn't do anything does it? But when the sun shines the leaves become green, just happens, I mean the sun doesn't

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.892
take any credit or doesn't say that the trees must offer God their goodness or something

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:42.892
to him. They are not angry with the sun are you?

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:56.892
Because it tans our body. Do you? In the same way it's somebody's nature to do that, and somebody's nature is to ascend

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.892
and to rise people who achieve it, don't you think so?

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:15.892
So there is nothing to feel unhappy about. This is another problem which I told you last time, that in the west it is a really big

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:24.892
hurdle for people. You cannot pay for it, you cannot put in any effort, you cannot do anything about it, it

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:32.892
has to work out otherwise we cannot guarantee that. If it is there it will work out, if it is not there it will not work out.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:43.892
If the desire is pure it will work out and then you have to work it out to keep it there.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:54.892
So by reading about it you may never understand, there are so many people who did

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:04.892
so many people who did Gita , so many people in India who know by heart the whole of Gita,

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:18.892
the meaning, everything but they have sickness, they've ill feelings, they're unhappy or ego

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:31.892
oriented, something wrong, somewhere. Nothing wrong with the scriptures, we have forgotten it is said you are to be born again.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.892
So the third experience should be of transformation.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:49.892
If it cannot bring out the virtue in you, if it cannot give you the strength of your

00:33:50.000 --> 00:34:01.892
spirit, if it cannot transform you then it is not self realisation.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.892
But transformation can be taken like this that people can just change the colour of

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.892
their clothes and say we are transformed, now we have taken a sanyasa, also can be like

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:22.892
that, all such self opinionated people.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:32.892
It's not that, it's no opinion, is to be in that state is important, to be in that state

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:39.892
that's the truth and that's the truth you should ask for, nothing else.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:50.892
Are you transformed by it and the first transformation you feel, before you change your temperament,

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.892
before you change your habit, before you take anything is that your central nervous system

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.892
acquires a new dimension of collective consciousness. Acquires!

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:09.892
You get it. And you can verify it.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:17.892
But human beings still think they have a right to no Mother no much, I don't believe in it.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:25.892
It's alright, who are you, I mean don't believe in yourself.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:32.892
So the first thing that should happen in this experience of transformation or evolution

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:43.892
is that you become, again I say become, become, become collectively conscious, by which you

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:50.892
know your chakras and you know the chakras of others, you know the subtle problems you

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.892
have, the subtle diseases you have, the hidden problems you have.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:02.892
The whole life which was abnormal comes to normal you see because you can see abnormal.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.892
Supposing I am standing on the edge of this and there is no light, I cannot see, I may fall down.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:17.892
I am about to fall down I cannot see but then is light, I see. So why not get into balance.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:25.892
That is enlightenment. If enlightenment doesn't give you the vision of wisdom it is not enlightenment at all.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.892
You drink, you smoke, you see all kinds of things, you have temper everything exists

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.892
and you say oh God I am a very religious person and the second thing that comes to you is

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:51.892
some sort of . So your virtue, your virtue must shine and that's the time is today according

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:58.892
to the Shalivan calendar this is the true faith.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:08.892
This is the yuga when there is, is the age when there is perfection means where you get

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.892
in contact, actual, with actuality.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:27.892
That means you actualise it and that is the time, today, that has come called as Krita

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:39.892
yuga. That means all pervading power is actualised and we feel the manifestation of that power

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:48.892
very, very clearly, on your central nervous system. Because what ever is evolved within you, you feel on your central nervous system.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:59.892
So this new breakthrough is to be seen through and not to be just accepted, not to have blind

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:17.892
faith, nothing of that kind. Then once you come to a certain state then the subject gets deeper and deeper and much

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.892
more intense, but first that state has to be established.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:31.892
Many people have complained to me that Mother Sahaja Yogis who are are rather secretive,

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:42.892
there are no secrets, no secrets but as a boy enters say maybe the first class or the

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.892
first he cannot understand what areas to be discussed.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:55.892
So he might feel this fellow is trying to hide something in his books.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:03.892
One has to grow to bear that truth also to bear that truth he has to develop that power

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:11.892
within ourselves and that state we have to achieve.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:26.892
I requested last time all the people of England especially, because in the map of the Divine,

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:36.892
England represents the heart and the responsibility of heart is the maximum and if they don't

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:45.892
pay attention to their heart the world will have a heart attack.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:53.892
So how important it is that we should seek our ascent as seekers.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.892
Of course I don't say, you don't do this, you don't do that, nothing of the kind, that

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:04.892
is not to be said anymore.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:13.892
Just first get your realisation then you look after your self I don't have to tell you. Then you get your light you yourself will see that you will not put your hand into the

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.892
crocodiles mouth there, are you? But first you must see the crocodile, because if I tell you the crocodile in the darkness,

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:26.892
you say let me try even if you, that's how it works.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:39.892
It’s so beautiful. There’s a very beautiful thing to achieve that’s what we say is the Kingdom of God,

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:50.892
that’s what we say that peace that is that resides within us, that joy,

00:40:51.000 --> 00:41:03.892
that fills the whole world as bliss, complete auspiciousness of God’s being can be ours

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:12.892
if we decide to be there, nobody can force you. No one can.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:23.892
It is you who has to choose it in your own freedom only you can achieve your complete freedom.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.892
May God Bless You.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:42:14.892
H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:27.892
Question: Shri Mataji. What is the … [some words ambiguous] Is there a thing that is ego? Is there such a thing that has ego and where does it come from?

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:40.892
Shri Mataji: ‘Yeh, there is. Quite a horrible one. Ego is a myth though. But the myth is there.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:49.892
It’s a myth. The myth is that we believe that we do something.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:43:01.892
I always give a very apt simile for this that some villagers were ask to go by a plane

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:08.892
and they were told not to carry to much luggage. So they got into the plane and put the luggage on their heads.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:15.892
They were ask: ‘Why are you doing this?’ and they said: ‘We are trying to reduce the weight of the plane.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:26.892
In the same way our ego works. And this ego exists though it’s a myth but the myth exists.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:34.892
When reality comes it disappears like the darkness exists, but when the sun comes it disappears.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:47.892
It comes to us from the idea that we do something. ‘I’, ‘my’, ‘I’. I can do it!

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:56.892
And from the ‚my‘. This is my. Identity, I-ness comes. Now what happens that

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:13.892
when we start working doing anything. See, even garbage cleaning, anything, dish washing,

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:23.892
anything that you think is trivial. ‘Oh, what a work I’m doing? Sparking clean I have done.’

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:33.892
I mean anything you do, you feel: ‘Oh, what a work I have done? But what do we do?

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:45.892
We convert dead from dead. Like this stage they got some plastic which is dead made into this stage

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:55.892
and they’ll think: ‘We made a great job!’ Some dead bricks the brought made this dead hall.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:02.892
And they will say: ‘We have done a great job!’ What do we do? Do we any living work? Nothing!

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:16.892
Do we? We don’t do any living work. That’s another myth. We think we do living work. No, it’s only God.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:23.892
So when we think we are doing something you must know what you are doing is nothing, you are just transforming from dead to dead.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:31.892
As a result what happens is also very dangerous. Supposing you get some bhoot

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.892
because the tree is dead. Tree has to die otherwise you cannot make a chair.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.892
So the tree dies you make it more dead to make a chair.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:50.892
By making a chair you sit on the chair and now you cannot sit on the ground, you become dead with the chair.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.892
You cannot sit on the ground you have to carry the chair all around it becomes a dominating feature.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:01.892
Anywhere you go you have to carry a handy-chair because can’t sit on the ground.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:10.892
So it gives you something called comfort which is really enslaves you.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:19.892
So what do we do is nothing. We are enslaving ourselves. You just detach yourself from this modern world

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.892
and see what slaves we are of so many things we have created.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:31.892
If the electricity goes off the whole London will topple down.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:41.892
We have become slaves of the matter. Just think of it because the dead has sitting on our heads.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:50.892
But this idea, ‘we have done this, we have that’, creates a kind of a balloon in our head,

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:59.892
you see here, which is mister ego. Which is the color of the bile.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:07.892
Such people have the right side working very hard. The right side produces the bile,

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:18.892
because is the sunline. We work when the sun is out and as a result of that we develop this ego within ourselves.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:27.892
So we have ego. But when you become hollow there is nothing like ego.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:37.892
Then He is the Mahat Ahankara. He is the great ego. He does everything. He is the doer, He is the enjoyer.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:50.892
What are we?  We are part and parcel of His being. Just to see, just to feel it.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:57.892
So to think that we do something is wrong, but if you go on saying: ‘No, I don’t do anything!’ then another thing comes in.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:05.892
That’s called as superego. We move like a pendulum from one to another. Then you say:

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.892
‘No, no, no! I’m doing wrong. I should not do like this. It is wrong. Better sit at home.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.892
Become a hippie, smoke some ganja. Finish off life.‘ Don’t do anything!

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.892
Do everything that will take you away from work, effortlessness, laziness, lethargic.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:29.892
Because if you do work you develop ego. So become non-egoistical, but you become superego.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:37.892
So no escape. So what do you do then? Is a problem! You be in the center.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:45.892
Just wait, don’t overdo anything. Be in the center, do everything moderation,

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:51.892
the Kundalini rises and you become that which is beyond ego and superego.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.892
You reach that state, here (Shri Mataji puts Her right hand over Her head). That’s what you have to become,

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.892
which is your right. Which you should get. For that you have become a human being.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:08.892
Why shouldn’t you have it? For that also is ego: ‘Why should I have?’ ‚All right, don‘t have it!‘

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:16.892
The best part of it: Ego makes you stupid, really stupid. This really makes you stupid.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:24.892
Best thing is to see an egoistical man. You’ll feel like laughing because he looks like a … [ambiguous; sounds like ‘bafoo’].

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:33.892
It can be very dangerous also. Like the ego of Hitler – very destructive.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:39.892
So the egoistical man destroys others and the superego-man destroys himself.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:46.892
He is all the time thinking: ‘I’m so bad. I’m no good. I’m good for nothing.’

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:54.892
Both are just the same in My eyes. Is again the mental projections. You are the spirit.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:02.892
You are neither ego nor superego but you are the spirit. Any other question?

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:18.892
Question: Is there such a thing like evil? Shri Mataji: Evil? Of course, there is! Evil is there.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:26.892
Who has told you there is no evil? Evil exists.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:35.892
There are people who are hurt by evil, who are tortured by evil. We see that every day.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:44.892
There are crooks. I don’t know how many varieties of evil there are.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:51:03.892
Evil exists. Is not only ignorance. But in the ignorance the harmful, destructive, sinister ideas that you grow.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:17.892
That is evil. That darkness is not so difficult but in the darkness the thorns that we grow within ourselves.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:27.892
Evil is there. We have to fight it. We are in the shackles of evil no doubt

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:33.892
and evil comes as an attack, unholy attack. You had evil,

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:34.000
say Bauhaus (note: school of modern architecture, founded 1919), I would say were evil people, who attacked you.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:45.892
Your architecture was destroyed, all your beauty was destroyed, everything was destroyed, now what do you have? These pigeon holes?

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.892
And now people become mad in this pigeon hole.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:58.892
It was an unholy attack, see it, so clear. How can you say that there was no evil?

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:09.892
It comes as aggression, it comes as any ideas of disparities.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:24.892
Also it could be very sly and sinister like our gurus have done. It’s very sinister, it comes in the garb of divine,

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:37.892
talks of God and kills you within. Gives you diseases, gives you problems – that’s evil,

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:47.892
that’s evil! To pronounce that you are divine when you are sinister.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:55.892
When you are not a realized soul, is evil.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:08.892
Sometimes I feel in modern times evil is more powerful than the desire of man to rise above it.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:14.892
The desire has to grow stronger. Then what is this? What are the powers of Satan?

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:23.892
Then nothing! They can be finished but if you want to vote for satanic law – have it!

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:31.892
It’s your desire, it’s your decision.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.892
You have to decide now, the time has come, the moment has come for you decide what do you want.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:43.892
It is very painful but it exists. Those who tell you there is no evil,

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:50.892
don’t believe that people, they must be the most sinisterly activating people.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:54:00.892
Take it from Me, those who say like that.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:05.892
I don’t want to be … [ambiguous, sounds like ‘skid’].
