02:59.168 --> 03:02.151
Shri Mataji: Oh you brought it all the way.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.580
Done the havan. The havan is done now? Let me see,

03:05.880 --> 03:07.880
what is the situation.

03:09.918 --> 03:12.018
Put all the fruits and everything.

03:12.173 --> 03:15.173
Yogi: Oh, She’s taking her shoes off.

03:55.186 --> 03:57.380
Shri Mataji: Oh, be seated.

03:57.580 --> 04:00.186
Still the heaviness of the puja is there.

04:06.625 --> 04:08.625
Much clearer.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.458
Be careful, be careful now.

04:15.082 --> 04:17.082
All right?

04:20.789 --> 04:23.989
So now we can leave at 1 o’clock from here?

04:24.590 --> 04:28.191
Brian Bell: Best leave earlier Shri
Mataji. Shri Mataji: Little earlier. All right.

04:28.365 --> 04:32.025
Brian Bell: We should be on the way twenty to, to see the gardens.

04:32.725 --> 04:36.049
Shri Mataji: So the luggage and all that can be sent ahead I think.

04:36.615 --> 04:38.133
All right.

04:38.334 --> 04:42.170
So, first of all, I would like to know your names. Individual names.

04:42.492 --> 04:45.372
Yogi: This is a car
full of people last night who come.

04:45.558 --> 04:47.130
Shri Mataji: So did the havan today?

04:47.330 --> 04:49.658
Yogi: No… Shri Mataji: They were not here. What’s your name?

04:49.848 --> 04:51.848
Yogini: Hansa. Hansa?

04:52.262 --> 04:53.762
Hansa…?

04:53.918 --> 04:55.660
Yogi: Hansa. Shri Mataji: Hansaj!

04:55.860 --> 04:58.418
What’s your name? Another Yogi: Suresh. Shri Mataji: Suresh.

04:58.711 --> 05:00.444
What’s yours?

05:00.601 --> 05:02.601
Yogini: Anish. Shri Mataji: Anish.

05:56.602 --> 05:59.602
Shri Mataji: How are you? What’s your name?

06:00.984 --> 06:05.023
He likes my photograph, see...

06:11.528 --> 06:13.528
What’s your name?

06:25.490 --> 06:27.490
Surrender.

06:27.827 --> 06:29.827
That’s a good thing.

06:31.793 --> 06:34.193
He’s curable, he can be cured.

06:36.988 --> 06:41.488
Give him some of my kum kum to be put in the night for him.

06:45.037 --> 06:49.375
It’s all right. Now, I would like to know
other names also. Now, what’s your name?

06:49.576 --> 06:52.127
Young girl: Rachael. Yogi: Rachael. Shri Mataji: Rachael.

06:52.308 --> 06:55.363
All right, for her she has a little problem here

06:55.563 --> 06:57.660
and it’s not due to the liver

06:57.861 --> 07:03.020
so you treat her liver, she’ll be all
right, perfectly all right here and also,

07:04.020 --> 07:07.320
we get in India something called Multani Mitti.

07:08.298 --> 07:12.898
In India we get something called Multani Mitti. It’s a kind of a...

07:13.132 --> 07:16.832
- Did a yogi give somebody a packet or something?

07:17.646 --> 07:19.879
For treatment of the skin.

07:21.598 --> 07:23.568
Yes, did he give?

07:23.887 --> 07:26.887
Yogi Mahajan? Did he give you? A yogini: No.

07:27.683 --> 07:32.063
Shri Mataji: No. So you see if you use that, that clears your...

07:33.440 --> 07:37.440
Yogi: Sort of ointment is it?
Shri Mataji: It’s a clay, it’s a kind of clay.

07:37.699 --> 07:41.199
It’s a kind of clay that clears it out.

07:43.303 --> 07:46.260
What I can… Yogini: We have got some sort of

07:46.460 --> 07:50.207
solid pieces of clay.

07:50.575 --> 07:53.042
Shri Mataji: Let me have, let us see.

07:59.897 --> 08:03.604
All right. So now, you put your left hand here.

08:03.788 --> 08:06.948
All right Rachael? No, left hand here. This side.

08:07.149 --> 08:10.880
Now, what about your name? Other young girl: Rebecca.

08:12.169 --> 08:15.620
Brian Bell: Rebecca. Shri Mataji:
Rebecca. Brian Bell: Rachael and Rebecca.

08:15.820 --> 08:18.575
Shri Mataji: She’s all right. Children
are all right, both of them are all right.

08:18.776 --> 08:23.482
Little, she has a little liver problem
and mother also has a little liver problem

08:23.682 --> 08:25.580
because she worries a lot

08:25.819 --> 08:29.647
and I’ve already told her. Did you get my message?

08:29.835 --> 08:33.413
You are to stand up on your legs and say that, you see clearly.

08:33.624 --> 08:36.694
After all, no husband should be a dictater.

08:36.895 --> 08:41.826
What love has he given is the point. How much
he has loved is the point, how much compassion

08:42.027 --> 08:47.248
and as you do not force him to come to
Sahaja Yoga, he should not force you to go on an act.

08:47.449 --> 08:51.755
See, the act you don’t like, you don’t like to
go to the sea, you should say, “I don’t like it,

08:51.955 --> 08:54.140
I feel sick, so why do you want to take me?”

08:54.340 --> 08:58.260
So I think you also go for a little
liver treatment, it will be a good idea.

09:01.797 --> 09:03.878
Now, what’s her name?

09:04.728 --> 09:08.628
Brian Bell: Adrian. Shri Mataji:
Adrian, I know. Next to him, yeah.

09:08.829 --> 09:12.389
Brian Bell: This is Margaret.
Shri Mataji: Margaret, Margaret. She's all right.

09:16.679 --> 09:18.379
David, I know.

09:18.794 --> 09:21.866
This one was there at the program.

09:22.046 --> 09:24.113
Were you there for the program?

09:24.328 --> 09:27.195
Brian Bell: He was here for Puja yesterday.

09:27.984 --> 09:31.985
Shri Mataji: And what’s his name?
Brian Bell: Greg. Shri Mataji: Greg.

09:32.204 --> 09:35.442
So how are you, Greg? Are you feeling better now?

09:36.954 --> 09:41.491
Dorothy’s all right, I can see that. Brian Bell: Gladys, this is Gladys.

09:41.692 --> 09:44.980
Shri Mataji: But she told me her
name is Dorothy. Brian Bell: Dorothy’s the…

09:46.430 --> 09:48.447
Shri Mataji: Another one?

09:49.283 --> 09:52.905
She’s Gladys. They look so much the same.

09:54.429 --> 09:57.437
To a Mother, everybody looks the same, I think.

10:00.640 --> 10:04.415
She has been to India and a very nice person.

10:06.331 --> 10:09.415
What have you done to the sweets that she has given us?

10:09.640 --> 10:11.388
Have you’ve been,

10:11.612 --> 10:16.160
- Are you better pack it up properly,
otherwise these Australians will trouble us a lot.

10:18.068 --> 10:20.420
Smuggling business is bad.

10:20.679 --> 10:25.180
You see we couldn’t smuggle all the mangos.
We have brought so many mangoes for all of you

10:25.381 --> 10:29.366
and they wouldn’t allow us to take them in
and I was very angry. I said this is very wrong.

10:29.567 --> 10:35.227
You see, these mangoes, after all, there’s nothing’s
going to go wrong with it, we’re going to all eat it off.

10:35.680 --> 10:37.680
They said no, no.

10:38.088 --> 10:40.757
And they argued and argued and argued.

10:42.567 --> 10:44.567
Now, what’s your name?

10:44.838 --> 10:47.775
Yogi: Bryce. Brian Bell: Bryce.

10:47.976 --> 10:50.951
Shri Mataji: Price? Price, P-R-I-C-E?

10:51.411 --> 10:53.849
Shri Mataji: Bryce, Bryce.

10:54.029 --> 10:59.109
You have different names, isn’t it,
in New Zealand? Little different, yes.

10:59.310 --> 11:01.990
Now, her’s I know. What’s your name?

11:02.191 --> 11:03.940
Yogini: Janie, Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji: Jane?

11:04.140 --> 11:07.082
Brian Bell: Janie. Shri Mataji: Janie, Janie.

11:07.283 --> 11:12.167
This one I know. What’s her name
there? I’ve also know Pritisha, yes.

11:12.355 --> 11:15.919
Brian Bell: Carol and Trisha,
Pritisha? Shri Mataji: I know both of them.

11:16.119 --> 11:20.658
She’s been to a Puja and all that, isn’t it, in India.

11:21.603 --> 11:26.443
Because I was surprised there was no sari for you because

11:26.643 --> 11:31.315
I remember I had chosen a sari
that’s why I asked from where did you get the sari.

11:32.734 --> 11:36.968
Yes, no, but you see this is
surprising because I had bought a sari for you.

11:37.297 --> 11:38.803
Very surprising.

11:39.004 --> 11:42.300
Many things have happened in Sahaja
Yoga which is very shocking sometimes.

11:42.500 --> 11:46.078
How these people come into Sahaja Yoga and sort of,

11:46.278 --> 11:49.187
I just don’t understand why are they there?

11:49.387 --> 11:53.374
We don’t have to have money problems and things like that.

11:53.574 --> 11:56.900
If you - I mean there should be no such problem.

11:57.100 --> 12:00.608
But there are some people who come inside, you see, like

12:01.273 --> 12:05.811
be able to call a fox in sheep’s dress or something like that.

12:06.020 --> 12:07.900
So that is how it has happened.

12:08.100 --> 12:11.528
But definitely I had a sari for you.

12:12.814 --> 12:17.680
I’ll find out, I’ll try to locate it. I’m sorry for that., really.

12:20.813 --> 12:23.351
Brian Bell: The only thing
Mother was that you liked the sari.

12:23.541 --> 12:27.660
Shri Mataji: Oh beautiful! The one you
bought was much better than the one I had bought.

12:33.257 --> 12:37.700
So very nice coming to New Zealand and
yesterday’s program was very encouraging.

12:37.900 --> 12:40.162
There were so many people, I was amazed because

12:40.362 --> 12:44.780
we could not send an article, we could not do the television,

12:44.980 --> 12:46.832
everything was against us and

12:47.032 --> 12:51.860
we could not also have the article in the Eve’s Weekly.

12:52.060 --> 12:54.810
Nothing came out, only on my

12:55.300 --> 12:59.090
just see my photograph, just see.

13:01.759 --> 13:05.328
Brian Bell: Shri Mataji, there are presents,

13:05.529 --> 13:09.020
some little presents for the
people who have been with us,

13:09.220 --> 13:12.570
who has joined us, our overseas...
