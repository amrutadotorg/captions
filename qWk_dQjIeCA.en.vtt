00:02:59.168 --> 00:03:02.151
Shri Mataji: Oh you brought it all the way.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.580
Done the havan. The havan is done now? Let me see,

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.880
what is the situation.

00:03:09.918 --> 00:03:12.018
Put all the fruits and everything.

00:03:12.173 --> 00:03:15.173
Yogi: Oh, She’s taking her shoes off.

00:03:55.186 --> 00:03:57.380
Shri Mataji: Oh, be seated.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.186
Still the heaviness of the puja is there.

00:04:06.625 --> 00:04:08.625
Much clearer.

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:12.458
Be careful, be careful now.

00:04:15.082 --> 00:04:17.082
All right?

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:23.989
So now we can leave at 1 o’clock from here?

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.191
Brian Bell: Best leave earlier Shri
Mataji. Shri Mataji: Little earlier. All right.

00:04:28.365 --> 00:04:32.025
Brian Bell: We should be on the way twenty to, to see the gardens.

00:04:32.725 --> 00:04:36.049
Shri Mataji: So the luggage and all that can be sent ahead I think.

00:04:36.615 --> 00:04:38.133
All right.

00:04:38.334 --> 00:04:42.170
So, first of all, I would like to know your names. Individual names.

00:04:42.492 --> 00:04:45.372
Yogi: This is a car
full of people last night who come.

00:04:45.558 --> 00:04:47.130
Shri Mataji: So did the havan today?

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.658
Yogi: No… Shri Mataji: They were not here. What’s your name?

00:04:49.848 --> 00:04:51.848
Yogini: Hansa. Hansa?

00:04:52.262 --> 00:04:53.762
Hansa…?

00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:55.660
Yogi: Hansa. Shri Mataji: Hansaj!

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.418
What’s your name? Another Yogi: Suresh. Shri Mataji: Suresh.

00:04:58.711 --> 00:05:00.444
What’s yours?

00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:02.601
Yogini: Anish. Shri Mataji: Anish.

00:05:56.602 --> 00:05:59.602
Shri Mataji: How are you? What’s your name?

00:06:00.984 --> 00:06:05.023
He likes my photograph, see...

00:06:11.528 --> 00:06:13.528
What’s your name?

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.490
Surrender.

00:06:27.827 --> 00:06:29.827
That’s a good thing.

00:06:31.793 --> 00:06:34.193
He’s curable, he can be cured.

00:06:36.988 --> 00:06:41.488
Give him some of my kum kum to be put in the night for him.

00:06:45.037 --> 00:06:49.375
It’s all right. Now, I would like to know
other names also. Now, what’s your name?

00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:52.127
Young girl: Rachael. Yogi: Rachael. Shri Mataji: Rachael.

00:06:52.308 --> 00:06:55.363
All right, for her she has a little problem here

00:06:55.563 --> 00:06:57.660
and it’s not due to the liver

00:06:57.861 --> 00:07:03.020
so you treat her liver, she’ll be all
right, perfectly all right here and also,

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.320
we get in India something called Multani Mitti.

00:07:08.298 --> 00:07:12.898
In India we get something called Multani Mitti. It’s a kind of a...

00:07:13.132 --> 00:07:16.832
- Did a yogi give somebody a packet or something?

00:07:17.646 --> 00:07:19.879
For treatment of the skin.

00:07:21.598 --> 00:07:23.568
Yes, did he give?

00:07:23.887 --> 00:07:26.887
Yogi Mahajan? Did he give you? A yogini: No.

00:07:27.683 --> 00:07:32.063
Shri Mataji: No. So you see if you use that, that clears your...

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.440
Yogi: Sort of ointment is it?
Shri Mataji: It’s a clay, it’s a kind of clay.

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:41.199
It’s a kind of clay that clears it out.

00:07:43.303 --> 00:07:46.260
What I can… Yogini: We have got some sort of

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.207
solid pieces of clay.

00:07:50.575 --> 00:07:53.042
Shri Mataji: Let me have, let us see.

00:07:59.897 --> 00:08:03.604
All right. So now, you put your left hand here.

00:08:03.788 --> 00:08:06.948
All right Rachael? No, left hand here. This side.

00:08:07.149 --> 00:08:10.880
Now, what about your name? Other young girl: Rebecca.

00:08:12.169 --> 00:08:15.620
Brian Bell: Rebecca. Shri Mataji:
Rebecca. Brian Bell: Rachael and Rebecca.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.575
Shri Mataji: She’s all right. Children
are all right, both of them are all right.

00:08:18.776 --> 00:08:23.482
Little, she has a little liver problem
and mother also has a little liver problem

00:08:23.682 --> 00:08:25.580
because she worries a lot

00:08:25.819 --> 00:08:29.647
and I’ve already told her. Did you get my message?

00:08:29.835 --> 00:08:33.413
You are to stand up on your legs and say that, you see clearly.

00:08:33.624 --> 00:08:36.694
After all, no husband should be a dictater.

00:08:36.895 --> 00:08:41.826
What love has he given is the point. How much
he has loved is the point, how much compassion

00:08:42.027 --> 00:08:47.248
and as you do not force him to come to
Sahaja Yoga, he should not force you to go on an act.

00:08:47.449 --> 00:08:51.755
See, the act you don’t like, you don’t like to
go to the sea, you should say, “I don’t like it,

00:08:51.955 --> 00:08:54.140
I feel sick, so why do you want to take me?”

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:58.260
So I think you also go for a little
liver treatment, it will be a good idea.

00:09:01.797 --> 00:09:03.878
Now, what’s her name?

00:09:04.728 --> 00:09:08.628
Brian Bell: Adrian. Shri Mataji:
Adrian, I know. Next to him, yeah.

00:09:08.829 --> 00:09:12.389
Brian Bell: This is Margaret.
Shri Mataji: Margaret, Margaret. She's all right.

00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:18.379
David, I know.

00:09:18.794 --> 00:09:21.866
This one was there at the program.

00:09:22.046 --> 00:09:24.113
Were you there for the program?

00:09:24.328 --> 00:09:27.195
Brian Bell: He was here for Puja yesterday.

00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:31.985
Shri Mataji: And what’s his name?
Brian Bell: Greg. Shri Mataji: Greg.

00:09:32.204 --> 00:09:35.442
So how are you, Greg? Are you feeling better now?

00:09:36.954 --> 00:09:41.491
Dorothy’s all right, I can see that. Brian Bell: Gladys, this is Gladys.

00:09:41.692 --> 00:09:44.980
Shri Mataji: But she told me her
name is Dorothy. Brian Bell: Dorothy’s the…

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:48.447
Shri Mataji: Another one?

00:09:49.283 --> 00:09:52.905
She’s Gladys. They look so much the same.

00:09:54.429 --> 00:09:57.437
To a Mother, everybody looks the same, I think.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:04.415
She has been to India and a very nice person.

00:10:06.331 --> 00:10:09.415
What have you done to the sweets that she has given us?

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.388
Have you’ve been,

00:10:11.612 --> 00:10:16.160
- Are you better pack it up properly,
otherwise these Australians will trouble us a lot.

00:10:18.068 --> 00:10:20.420
Smuggling business is bad.

00:10:20.679 --> 00:10:25.180
You see we couldn’t smuggle all the mangos.
We have brought so many mangoes for all of you

00:10:25.381 --> 00:10:29.366
and they wouldn’t allow us to take them in
and I was very angry. I said this is very wrong.

00:10:29.567 --> 00:10:35.227
You see, these mangoes, after all, there’s nothing’s
going to go wrong with it, we’re going to all eat it off.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.680
They said no, no.

00:10:38.088 --> 00:10:40.757
And they argued and argued and argued.

00:10:42.567 --> 00:10:44.567
Now, what’s your name?

00:10:44.838 --> 00:10:47.775
Yogi: Bryce. Brian Bell: Bryce.

00:10:47.976 --> 00:10:50.951
Shri Mataji: Price? Price, P-R-I-C-E?

00:10:51.411 --> 00:10:53.849
Shri Mataji: Bryce, Bryce.

00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:59.109
You have different names, isn’t it,
in New Zealand? Little different, yes.

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:01.990
Now, her’s I know. What’s your name?

00:11:02.191 --> 00:11:03.940
Yogini: Janie, Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji: Jane?

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.082
Brian Bell: Janie. Shri Mataji: Janie, Janie.

00:11:07.283 --> 00:11:12.167
This one I know. What’s her name
there? I’ve also know Pritisha, yes.

00:11:12.355 --> 00:11:15.919
Brian Bell: Carol and Trisha,
Pritisha? Shri Mataji: I know both of them.

00:11:16.119 --> 00:11:20.658
She’s been to a Puja and all that, isn’t it, in India.

00:11:21.603 --> 00:11:26.443
Because I was surprised there was no sari for you because

00:11:26.643 --> 00:11:31.315
I remember I had chosen a sari
that’s why I asked from where did you get the sari.

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:36.968
Yes, no, but you see this is
surprising because I had bought a sari for you.

00:11:37.297 --> 00:11:38.803
Very surprising.

00:11:39.004 --> 00:11:42.300
Many things have happened in Sahaja
Yoga which is very shocking sometimes.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.078
How these people come into Sahaja Yoga and sort of,

00:11:46.278 --> 00:11:49.187
I just don’t understand why are they there?

00:11:49.387 --> 00:11:53.374
We don’t have to have money problems and things like that.

00:11:53.574 --> 00:11:56.900
If you - I mean there should be no such problem.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.608
But there are some people who come inside, you see, like

00:12:01.273 --> 00:12:05.811
be able to call a fox in sheep’s dress or something like that.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.900
So that is how it has happened.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:11.528
But definitely I had a sari for you.

00:12:12.814 --> 00:12:17.680
I’ll find out, I’ll try to locate it. I’m sorry for that., really.

00:12:20.813 --> 00:12:23.351
Brian Bell: The only thing
Mother was that you liked the sari.

00:12:23.541 --> 00:12:27.660
Shri Mataji: Oh beautiful! The one you
bought was much better than the one I had bought.

00:12:33.257 --> 00:12:37.700
So very nice coming to New Zealand and
yesterday’s program was very encouraging.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.162
There were so many people, I was amazed because

00:12:40.362 --> 00:12:44.780
we could not send an article, we could not do the television,

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.832
everything was against us and

00:12:47.032 --> 00:12:51.860
we could not also have the article in the Eve’s Weekly.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.810
Nothing came out, only on my

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:59.090
just see my photograph, just see.

00:13:01.759 --> 00:13:05.328
Brian Bell: Shri Mataji, there are presents,

00:13:05.529 --> 00:13:09.020
some little presents for the
people who have been with us,

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.570
who has joined us, our overseas...
