00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.040
Today we have decided

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.875
to have a puja of Virata

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.124
in the land of Shri Krishna.

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:24.958
As you know, in the growth of Shri Vishnu's manifestation,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.374
He comes into ten incarnations

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.166
and ultimately He manifests Himself as Virat.

00:00:37.624 --> 00:00:54.708
Virat is the brain of the being which can call as God Almighty,

00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:59.040
so the whole central nervous system is worked through

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.550
by Shri Krishna as Vishnu,

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.269
then all this incarnations,

00:01:08.404 --> 00:01:14.029
then Shri Krishna and ultimately as Virat.

00:01:14.321 --> 00:01:18.737
This is the development of our brain

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:23.321
and when we are worshipping Virat,

00:01:23.446 --> 00:01:28.611
we have to know that within us also we have got

00:01:28.611 --> 00:01:34.611
the manifestation of this power of Virat.

00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:38.611
That manifestation which we have

00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:46.611
we can call it as Virat if Shri Krishna is Mahavirata.

00:01:46.653 --> 00:01:49.029
You all know about Virat

00:01:49.154 --> 00:01:52.653
much more than I can tell you today

00:01:52.778 --> 00:01:57.737
because It's the whole,

00:01:57.903 --> 00:02:00.820
It's the totality.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:09.404
And the totality of everything, if that is Virat,

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:12.611
then that is in your brain,

00:02:12.611 --> 00:02:18.611
but reality is in your heart.

00:02:18.653 --> 00:02:22.820
So the totality you may see,

00:02:22.945 --> 00:02:25.029
you may witness,

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:30.611
the reality is the subtlety behind it.

00:02:30.611 --> 00:02:34.362
So the brain which is not ruled by the heart,

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:37.070
which is not nourished by the heart,

00:02:37.195 --> 00:02:39.611
is a very dangerous thing,

00:02:39.611 --> 00:02:43.029
because it creates extroversion,

00:02:43.154 --> 00:02:48.571
and such a person who is without any heart

00:02:48.611 --> 00:02:54.529
tries to do things, becomes very ruthless

00:02:54.611 --> 00:02:57.070
and can be very dangerous.

00:02:57.195 --> 00:03:01.446
It could the other way also within us;

00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:05.154
that if we allow our heart to rule us,

00:03:05.446 --> 00:03:07.611
only live with our emotions

00:03:07.611 --> 00:03:09.903
and not to use our rationality,

00:03:10.029 --> 00:03:15.778
then we can become really very dangerous people to ourselves.

00:03:15.903 --> 00:03:19.112
In the sense, we become lethargic,

00:03:19.237 --> 00:03:24.571
we become indulgent into wrong sort of things.

00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:28.279
And today what one feels that in America

00:03:28.404 --> 00:03:29.862
there's more dominance

00:03:29.903 --> 00:03:33.987
of the left side than of the right.

00:03:35.571 --> 00:03:38.195
Right side is our attention

00:03:38.611 --> 00:03:41.611
and the right side of attention is we can say

00:03:41.611 --> 00:03:45.612
is the liver of God Almighty.

00:03:45.737 --> 00:03:48.529
So now when we have to talk of the totality,

00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:50.862
when we are part and parcel of the totality

00:03:50.987 --> 00:03:56.112
and now we are awakened to that existence of ours

00:03:56.237 --> 00:03:59.611
as the part and parcel of the whole,

00:03:59.611 --> 00:04:01.820
then we have to realize to become the whole

00:04:01.945 --> 00:04:04.362
we have to do something about it.

00:04:04.487 --> 00:04:07.070
Specially in the land of Shri Krishna

00:04:07.195 --> 00:04:10.279
we have to work out this tremendous task

00:04:10.404 --> 00:04:14.820
of creating Viratas out of Sahaja Yogis.

00:04:16.154 --> 00:04:20.611
After going through the various experiences

00:04:20.653 --> 00:04:23.820
of American Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:23.945 --> 00:04:25.653
I've reached a conclusion

00:04:25.903 --> 00:04:29.321
that we have to talk more frankly about things

00:04:29.446 --> 00:04:31.611
than we have been talking before.

00:04:31.611 --> 00:04:36.112
Why there's such a failure of Sahaja Yoga in this great country

00:04:36.237 --> 00:04:40.611
while there are so many seekers.

00:04:41.611 --> 00:04:47.279
The main point is that we do not realize

00:04:47.404 --> 00:04:53.903
that the left side is overpowering this country very much.

00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:59.903
There are people who are active,

00:05:01.611 --> 00:05:06.362
but the percentage is very low

00:05:06.487 --> 00:05:08.695
because of too much of affluence,

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.404
too much of freedom,

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:16.404
the idea of "what's wrong in anything."

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:20.695
People are going towards shamelessness,

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:26.279
immoral life, self-indulgent.

00:05:26.404 --> 00:05:30.487
And this self-indulgence, to protect that,

00:05:30.571 --> 00:05:34.611
people always develop a kind of a ego

00:05:34.611 --> 00:05:39.529
which has no dynamism in it.

00:05:41.237 --> 00:05:45.611
So now the problem lies with Sahaja Yogis,

00:05:45.778 --> 00:05:48.070
not with Sahaja Yoga as such.

00:05:48.195 --> 00:05:51.611
When you see that the land is not so fertile

00:05:51.695 --> 00:05:54.611
and here you have to work very hard,

00:05:54.611 --> 00:05:57.903
the responsibility of all the Sahaja Yogis in America

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:00.237
is to go deep.

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:05.362
You can see wherever the land is not fertile

00:06:05.487 --> 00:06:08.279
the trees go very deep down,

00:06:08.404 --> 00:06:14.612
they dig very deep into the Mother Earth

00:06:14.737 --> 00:06:18.611
for the sap to be sucked in.

00:06:18.653 --> 00:06:22.571
And the same way they grow very high,

00:06:22.611 --> 00:06:28.695
because the strength of their deepening

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.279
gives them this great height.

00:06:31.404 --> 00:06:33.321
So they grow very tall

00:06:33.446 --> 00:06:35.446
and also they are very deep.

00:06:35.571 --> 00:06:38.778
In the same way the Sahaja Yogis of America

00:06:38.903 --> 00:06:40.321
have to work out

00:06:40.446 --> 00:06:43.070
because here it's so much superficiality

00:06:43.195 --> 00:06:45.321
and so much of frivolousness

00:06:45.446 --> 00:06:49.820
and also no meaning to their lives.

00:06:49.945 --> 00:06:51.903
They have no meanings at all

00:06:51.987 --> 00:06:55.653
and they are just frittering away their lives

00:06:55.778 --> 00:06:58.611
with all nonsensical ideas about their emotions

00:06:58.611 --> 00:07:01.154
and their love and all those things.

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:05.529
So what we need today are Sahaja Yogis who are right-sided,

00:07:05.611 --> 00:07:08.611
those who will produce results,

00:07:08.611 --> 00:07:10.611
those who will be dynamic.

00:07:10.611 --> 00:07:14.112
They don't have to worry that somebody is right-sided

00:07:14.237 --> 00:07:15.862
and he'll become right-sided,

00:07:15.987 --> 00:07:18.154
actually that is what is needed today.

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:21.611
Unless and until you have people who are dynamic

00:07:21.611 --> 00:07:23.695
we cannot work it out.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.653
It's a reaction in this country as well as in England,

00:07:26.778 --> 00:07:29.611
in many countries who dominated other people.

00:07:29.611 --> 00:07:32.404
Like you see in this place

00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:35.404
which was actually originally belonged

00:07:35.529 --> 00:07:42.112
to some tribes of Indians

00:07:42.237 --> 00:07:46.611
and the English, the Spanish and all these Europeans came,

00:07:46.611 --> 00:07:48.611
killed them and occupied here.

00:07:48.611 --> 00:07:50.029
It's a highway robbery,

00:07:50.154 --> 00:07:51.653
absolutely highway robbery.

00:07:51.778 --> 00:07:58.029
Because of their arrogance and their aggressiveness,

00:07:58.154 --> 00:08:01.070
they could not see that they were doing such a horrible thing.

00:08:01.195 --> 00:08:04.404
I mean, why call any names of Hitler,

00:08:04.529 --> 00:08:06.611
they're even worse than Hitler,

00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:09.029
because at least Hitler was taken to task,

00:08:09.154 --> 00:08:12.611
he was condemned and people know that it was a mistake.

00:08:12.695 --> 00:08:15.529
But what about those who came all the way from there

00:08:15.611 --> 00:08:18.404
and killed so many people here

00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:22.070
and nicely having a very nice time everywhere

00:08:22.195 --> 00:08:23.611
as great Americans

00:08:23.611 --> 00:08:27.611
and now they are trying to show off everywhere.

00:08:27.945 --> 00:08:30.653
Actually it's such a sinful thing that is done

00:08:30.778 --> 00:08:33.611
that all these souls which have died

00:08:33.695 --> 00:08:35.611
I think have possessed them

00:08:35.695 --> 00:08:40.112
and now today America is on the left hand side.

00:08:40.237 --> 00:08:44.820
The right hand side of Americans is finished now,

00:08:44.945 --> 00:08:48.446
they are on the left hand side, guilty,

00:08:48.571 --> 00:08:51.446
feeling guilty they are taking to indulgences.

00:08:51.571 --> 00:08:53.611
Once you go to the right side, you see,

00:08:53.611 --> 00:08:54.903
you are very disciplined

00:08:55.029 --> 00:09:00.154
and you become very ascetic by temperament,

00:09:00.279 --> 00:09:04.903
I should say, and you want to dominate others

00:09:05.029 --> 00:09:06.695
and you want to capture.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:11.611
But today the situation of England and America is just the same.

00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:14.611
In England the same thing I find with Sahaja Yogis

00:09:14.611 --> 00:09:16.612
they are just lovey-dovey types, you see,

00:09:16.737 --> 00:09:22.446
and all they love Me and love Me and love Me.

00:09:22.611 --> 00:09:25.279
And I just don't understand.

00:09:25.404 --> 00:09:26.611
What's this going on?

00:09:26.611 --> 00:09:28.321
They all love Me

00:09:28.446 --> 00:09:30.611
and they'll bring flowers for Me, finished.

00:09:30.611 --> 00:09:32.945
Is this the way we are going to work our Sahaja Yoga

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:36.611
in that England and in this America?

00:09:36.653 --> 00:09:41.279
"Mother, I love you very much." So what?

00:09:43.778 --> 00:09:48.321
So to become one part and parcel of the whole,

00:09:48.446 --> 00:09:51.404
a drop has to become the ocean,

00:09:51.529 --> 00:09:53.820
you have to become great people,

00:09:53.945 --> 00:09:57.195
you have to be responsible.

00:09:57.321 --> 00:09:59.945
And this lovey-dovey business that you have

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:02.446
has to go out of your mind completely,

00:10:02.571 --> 00:10:05.862
otherwise Sahaja Yoga cannot work out in these two countries

00:10:05.987 --> 00:10:10.611
and you'll be cursed one after another.

00:10:11.321 --> 00:10:13.029
There are shocks after shocks

00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:17.529
that are coming to this country as well as to England.

00:10:17.611 --> 00:10:20.612
But people are not learning any lessons from that,

00:10:20.737 --> 00:10:23.446
still it is all right;

00:10:23.571 --> 00:10:25.903
we get this disease, all right;

00:10:26.029 --> 00:10:27.611
then we glorify it.

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:32.029
If we are suffering from ecological difference,

00:10:32.154 --> 00:10:33.611
still we are glorified.

00:10:33.611 --> 00:10:36.279
If you are using too much of machinery out of balance,

00:10:36.529 --> 00:10:37.945
still we are glorified.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:42.195
Because they just want self-indulgence.

00:10:42.446 --> 00:10:45.321
Just for self-indulgence they don't want to see the point

00:10:45.446 --> 00:10:49.154
that what is going wrong with this country is that,

00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:54.487
that they do not see anything that is reality.

00:10:54.611 --> 00:10:57.279
And the reality, though it is in the heart,

00:10:57.404 --> 00:10:59.279
though it works in the heart, it has to act.

00:10:59.404 --> 00:11:05.945
This has to act and if it does not act,

00:11:09.237 --> 00:11:11.611
this kind of a passive behavior

00:11:11.737 --> 00:11:13.195
is not going to help you.

00:11:13.321 --> 00:11:14.862
Now at this old age of Mine

00:11:14.987 --> 00:11:17.695
I'm traveling from places to places

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.612
and I'm doing so much.

00:11:19.737 --> 00:11:25.945
Now let us think about it: what have we done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:11:26.611 --> 00:11:29.070
Those who see you,

00:11:29.195 --> 00:11:34.695
see you as sometimes as just some hippies with disheveled hairs

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:37.611
and something that kind of a thing.

00:11:37.695 --> 00:11:39.611
This is the report I have,

00:11:39.611 --> 00:11:42.321
from people who came to your centers and things like that.

00:11:42.446 --> 00:11:44.945
"Oh, they are a set of hippies, you see," just like that.

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:47.362
So the first thing a Sahaja Yogi has to do,

00:11:47.487 --> 00:11:49.903
has to make up something of his personality,

00:11:50.029 --> 00:11:53.154
in America is very important.

00:11:53.737 --> 00:11:56.611
They are studying, they are out of job,

00:11:56.903 --> 00:11:58.611
they are doing this, that.

00:11:58.903 --> 00:12:02.112
That sort of people are not going to help Sahaja Yoga at all,

00:12:02.237 --> 00:12:04.112
they'll be liabilities on Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:04.237 --> 00:12:07.987
If you really want to do something you have to become something.

00:12:08.237 --> 00:12:10.279
You have to study, you have to become something,

00:12:10.404 --> 00:12:14.404
you have to have some sort of a degree, diploma, something

00:12:14.529 --> 00:12:17.195
attached to you, you have to mean something.

00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:20.653
Hippies cannot run Sahaja Yoga in America;

00:12:20.778 --> 00:12:28.112
they may run better in India but not here.

00:12:28.237 --> 00:12:30.611
So one has to realize that

00:12:30.653 --> 00:12:32.611
what has gone wrong with us is that

00:12:32.653 --> 00:12:36.862
we are now following a very subtle way

00:12:36.987 --> 00:12:42.362
of the same trends that we have taken.

00:12:42.487 --> 00:13:01.571
After Realization, we think that we are realized souls,

00:13:01.611 --> 00:13:03.611
that we have become yogis now,

00:13:03.653 --> 00:13:07.321
that we are realized souls.

00:13:07.695 --> 00:13:11.029
But one should see

00:13:11.279 --> 00:13:13.695
that we have become realized souls, no doubt,

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:19.611
but whatever bindings we had before coming to Sahaja Yoga

00:13:19.611 --> 00:13:23.695
have become subtler.

00:13:25.611 --> 00:13:34.112
They have not expressed themselves as lights,

00:13:34.237 --> 00:13:38.903
just we believe that we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:43.321
We believe that we have vibrations

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:47.321
and also we can feel the vibrations.

00:13:47.446 --> 00:13:50.653
But still we have not reached that state

00:13:50.778 --> 00:13:55.945
where we have become the totality.

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:59.279
We have to still grow.

00:13:59.404 --> 00:14:02.529
And if you are settled down with your vibrations

00:14:02.611 --> 00:14:04.695
and thinking that you are all right,

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.446
you are sadly mistaken.

00:14:07.571 --> 00:14:11.695
Whatever were our conditionings before coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:15.695
say you were a hippie,

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.653
so the enlightenment has come,

00:14:18.778 --> 00:14:23.611
but then the idea of this love business is there.

00:14:23.695 --> 00:14:26.571
Supposing you were a business man,

00:14:26.611 --> 00:14:28.778
so the enlightenment has come to you

00:14:28.903 --> 00:14:32.820
and you think that Mother should help you in your business,

00:14:32.945 --> 00:14:34.653
that's what it is.

00:14:34.778 --> 00:14:37.611
Supposing now if you were unmarried

00:14:37.695 --> 00:14:39.404
and you are married in Sahaja Yoga,

00:14:39.529 --> 00:14:42.529
then you want that your marriage should be successful

00:14:42.611 --> 00:14:44.653
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:44.778 --> 00:14:51.611
If there has been a problem in your health or something like that,

00:14:51.611 --> 00:14:54.903
then you have become a subtler person that you think,

00:14:55.029 --> 00:14:59.903
"I asked help from Mother for that."

00:15:00.195 --> 00:15:06.321
But we do not think that what have we contributed to Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:07.611 --> 00:15:11.487
We had certain things

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:16.945
which we thought were wrong - maybe that,

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:17.446
but in Sahaja Yoga we do not see those things are with us,

00:15:17.653 --> 00:15:23.154
still continuing with us.

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:27.611
To become Virata we have to really examine ourselves,

00:15:27.611 --> 00:15:32.112
without any anger, malice or anything, but see for ourselves.

00:15:32.237 --> 00:15:35.612
I know people who are small-minded,

00:15:35.737 --> 00:15:40.903
who have jealousies and their jealousies continue.

00:15:41.029 --> 00:15:44.321
Supposing there's a good musician,

00:15:44.446 --> 00:15:48.778
they'll not appreciate if the other person is a musician,

00:15:49.611 --> 00:15:51.112
he will not appreciate,

00:15:51.237 --> 00:15:54.362
he will not encourage that person that,

00:15:54.487 --> 00:15:59.154
"Really I am a musician, he's also a musician, let me help him."

00:16:00.653 --> 00:16:05.404
So the small-mindedness that existed before

00:16:05.529 --> 00:16:08.611
still becomes in a glorified way.

00:16:08.695 --> 00:16:10.611
The person will think that

00:16:10.611 --> 00:16:13.695
"All right, I am a musician and I sing very well

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.611
and I am singing Mother's praise."

00:16:16.611 --> 00:16:19.070
But anybody else who's singing

00:16:20.611 --> 00:16:23.321
will not be appreciated

00:16:23.446 --> 00:16:26.154
to that extent as you should expect

00:16:26.279 --> 00:16:32.237
that you are a part and parcel of the whole.

00:16:33.529 --> 00:16:35.611
This hand, if it feels hurt,

00:16:35.611 --> 00:16:40.778
the another hand immediately helps it.

00:16:44.611 --> 00:16:49.945
In the whole body you see the system is so totally connected.

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:56.070
As soon as you eat food, the digestive system starts working.

00:16:56.195 --> 00:16:58.529
But we should watch ourselves.

00:16:58.611 --> 00:16:59.778
If you have to become deeper,

00:16:59.903 --> 00:17:02.695
we have to watch ourselves where are we lacking.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:04.611
Now how does a tree grow?

00:17:04.611 --> 00:17:05.945
I have told you many times the story

00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:08.903
that there's a little cell at the end of the root

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:11.070
and it knows,

00:17:11.195 --> 00:17:15.154
and it knows one purpose: that it has to become a tree,

00:17:15.279 --> 00:17:16.612
so it goes round.

00:17:16.737 --> 00:17:20.195
It sees a boulder or something, stone, goes round it,

00:17:20.321 --> 00:17:21.695
doesn't fight it.

00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:25.695
Because ultimately what we have to achieve

00:17:26.154 --> 00:17:28.695
is to become the tree,

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.737
so we have to keep that in view,

00:17:31.987 --> 00:17:34.653
that we have to become the tree

00:17:34.903 --> 00:17:38.529
and not some sort of a small little frog here and there

00:17:38.611 --> 00:17:41.029
croaking about Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:41.446 --> 00:17:45.237
No, that's not going to work out!

00:17:45.611 --> 00:17:47.611
And this is what I find

00:17:47.653 --> 00:17:53.695
also very true about people in, say, England, same thing.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.029
The leaders are fighting,

00:17:55.154 --> 00:17:58.112
the leaders are trying to find out ways and methods

00:17:58.237 --> 00:18:00.903
how to improve the quality of Sahaja Yogis,

00:18:01.029 --> 00:18:02.446
but it's the Sahaja Yogis

00:18:02.571 --> 00:18:05.195
who have to know that the responsibility is theirs.

00:18:05.321 --> 00:18:11.862
They have to grow, they have to become Viratas.

00:18:11.987 --> 00:18:13.611
And this is America

00:18:13.611 --> 00:18:16.611
where I told you is the place of Shri Krishna,

00:18:16.611 --> 00:18:19.653
where Shri Krishna became the Virat.

00:18:21.237 --> 00:18:27.695
Unless and until you see for yourself

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:33.029
that we have to do this, we have to become this,

00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:37.653
you are still busy with our little, little silly problems.

00:18:37.903 --> 00:18:39.529
It's a vicious circle,

00:18:39.611 --> 00:18:42.611
as soon as you start worrying about your silly problems

00:18:42.611 --> 00:18:48.029
and your old stuffs still becoming glorified in Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:48.487 --> 00:18:54.321
then you find the vicious circle starts working,

00:18:54.695 --> 00:18:58.404
it doesn't achieve anything,

00:18:58.529 --> 00:19:00.695
it doesn't give you good chances,

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:05.154
it doesn't give you confidence.

00:19:05.279 --> 00:19:10.321
It's such a thing, it's like a packaging as they call it.

00:19:10.446 --> 00:19:15.029
But as soon as you decide, "No, I am going to do it,"

00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:17.070
you people are Sahaja Yogis,

00:19:17.195 --> 00:19:20.195
you know all about Kundalini,

00:19:20.321 --> 00:19:22.611
you know all about awakening,

00:19:22.653 --> 00:19:28.070
you know all about higher stages of attainment,

00:19:28.195 --> 00:19:33.611
you all, everyone is capable of giving Realization to people.

00:19:33.611 --> 00:19:36.611
You know where the thing is stuck,

00:19:36.695 --> 00:19:42.611
everything you know, but now just think about it,

00:19:42.653 --> 00:19:50.903
how many of you have been able to do something about it?

00:19:51.029 --> 00:19:56.862
When people see you their idea about you is very poor.

00:19:56.987 --> 00:20:01.653
They think that you are stuck up with your wives,

00:20:01.778 --> 00:20:04.279
so the wife is very dominating,

00:20:04.404 --> 00:20:06.362
so this is happening.

00:20:06.487 --> 00:20:08.112
Suddenly you go off,

00:20:08.237 --> 00:20:10.862
you see your child, worried about this one, you ...

00:20:10.987 --> 00:20:14.653
Sometimes I am surprised that once they are married,

00:20:14.778 --> 00:20:16.611
they have a child,

00:20:16.611 --> 00:20:20.820
then they become nothing but the parents of the child, finished,

00:20:20.945 --> 00:20:23.029
Sahaja Yoga is finished.

00:20:23.154 --> 00:20:25.611
Then the child becomes important.

00:20:25.695 --> 00:20:32.154
The blessings become the bindings.

00:20:32.611 --> 00:20:36.695
So you have to watch within yourself

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:40.987
that we are here for liberation, for complete freedom.

00:20:41.404 --> 00:20:43.029
But in the subtle way

00:20:43.154 --> 00:20:45.695
all these things go on binding

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:47.778
you and you are attached to it

00:20:47.903 --> 00:20:51.611
and you don't know how they are still tagging you down,

00:20:51.653 --> 00:20:53.404
don't allow you to fly,

00:20:53.529 --> 00:20:54.903
they don't give you the freedom

00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:59.695
that is your own right to have it.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.611
So even if I make a aeroplane,

00:21:02.611 --> 00:21:05.070
I do everything, put the fuel into it,

00:21:05.195 --> 00:21:10.778
I say everything, but doesn't want to fly.

00:21:10.903 --> 00:21:13.404
Now what do you do with such an aeroplane

00:21:13.529 --> 00:21:16.321
which doesn't want to fly?

00:21:16.446 --> 00:21:19.446
This sort of a situation is there

00:21:19.611 --> 00:21:22.820
and this situation makes you so limited

00:21:23.154 --> 00:21:27.611
and so dwarfy. How will you grow?

00:21:27.611 --> 00:21:31.945
Unless and until you grow and you show that

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:33.611
in your day to day life

00:21:33.611 --> 00:21:36.404
into your personality, into everything,

00:21:36.529 --> 00:21:39.862
I assure you nobody is going to be impressed by you.

00:21:39.987 --> 00:21:44.778
Sahaja Yoga is not going to work by advertisement,

00:21:44.903 --> 00:21:47.446
nor by My photographs,

00:21:47.571 --> 00:21:51.903
it's going to work by your work, by your responsibility,

00:21:52.029 --> 00:21:54.446
by your shouldering Sahaja Yoga,

00:21:54.571 --> 00:21:59.404
it's your responsibility to spread Sahaja Yoga and to establish it.

00:21:59.529 --> 00:22:02.695
But first of all your shoulders should be strong.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.070
You are still out of job,

00:22:05.195 --> 00:22:08.321
you are still something, somebody hanging in the air,

00:22:08.446 --> 00:22:12.571
you are still somebody who'll not even look at you.

00:22:12.611 --> 00:22:17.070
Then how can you carry on your shoulders?

00:22:18.903 --> 00:22:23.404
So first thing is to build yourself inside

00:22:23.529 --> 00:22:25.446
as well as outside,

00:22:25.571 --> 00:22:27.321
but such a vicious circle I tell you.

00:22:27.446 --> 00:22:29.611
If you do not go deep into yourself,

00:22:29.611 --> 00:22:32.404
you cannot also get the outside thing,

00:22:32.529 --> 00:22:33.945
so it works hand in hand,

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:36.611
as soon as you start building yourself inside,

00:22:36.695 --> 00:22:39.653
you'll be amazed how things will work out,

00:22:39.778 --> 00:22:43.446
how you'll become dynamic, how you'll become great.

00:22:43.571 --> 00:22:45.029
But you get involved into things

00:22:45.154 --> 00:22:48.778
which are very small and transitory.

00:22:48.903 --> 00:22:53.154
So as I told you before, we are seeking the eternal.

00:22:53.279 --> 00:22:55.820
So the transitory things are to be only used

00:22:55.945 --> 00:23:00.987
very temporarily, what we need is not so important.

00:23:01.321 --> 00:23:04.903
If you can understand this thing clearly,

00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:11.029
that we still are not free, not detached

00:23:11.154 --> 00:23:16.611
from all the things we had before Sahaja Yoga

00:23:16.695 --> 00:23:19.778
and they have become subtler and subtler and subtler.

00:23:19.903 --> 00:23:25.112
We are still only using Sahaja Yoga for that purpose

00:23:25.237 --> 00:23:31.154
and not for spreading the light.

00:23:34.321 --> 00:23:40.029
So what's going to happen?

00:23:41.487 --> 00:23:44.112
This is absolutely,

00:23:44.237 --> 00:23:49.778
absolutely to be really to be understood within yourself.

00:23:49.903 --> 00:23:54.029
Sometimes My lectures, you see, are little harsh,

00:23:54.154 --> 00:23:58.029
people think that Mother had to say these things,

00:23:58.154 --> 00:24:01.112
this is also out of My love for you

00:24:01.362 --> 00:24:05.945
and out of My love for this country.

00:24:06.737 --> 00:24:09.611
You have to really see to yourself,

00:24:09.695 --> 00:24:17.611
"What are we? Where are we?"

00:24:18.653 --> 00:24:24.778
We are not going to end up because Sahaja Yogis we had

00:24:24.903 --> 00:24:33.237
were subnormal people in the society.

00:24:33.611 --> 00:24:36.611
If you see the gurus how they spread themselves,

00:24:36.611 --> 00:24:38.945
though they are false, they are useless

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:42.778
but everybody knows about somebody who comes up. In two months time

00:24:42.903 --> 00:24:46.529
all over the world you can hear about that person.

00:24:46.611 --> 00:24:47.611
What they do,

00:24:47.653 --> 00:24:51.154
they go and first of all see the people who are successful,

00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:53.945
who are prominent in the city.

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:57.029
They never bother about people who are drug addicts,

00:24:57.279 --> 00:25:00.446
or who are suffering from diseases, no nothing doing,

00:25:00.571 --> 00:25:03.903
they have no business with them.

00:25:04.029 --> 00:25:06.404
They'll just attack the people

00:25:06.529 --> 00:25:10.404
who are very successful, who are very rich,

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.903
because they are on top of the society,

00:25:14.029 --> 00:25:15.778
so they'll go and meet people

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.903
and make contacts with them and ask them and this and that

00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:21.611
and then they call them for the program,

00:25:21.653 --> 00:25:23.611
give them all the importance, everything,

00:25:23.611 --> 00:25:24.820
then people start thinking,

00:25:24.945 --> 00:25:28.279
"Oh God! What a great thing it is to be here."

00:25:28.404 --> 00:25:32.321
Then pamper their ego a little bit, this and that's how they spread.

00:25:32.446 --> 00:25:35.279
But there's no reality in it, there's nothing,

00:25:35.529 --> 00:25:36.611
nothing special about it,

00:25:36.653 --> 00:25:39.945
it's all useless, it's all artificial.

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:42.611
But that is how they sell themselves.

00:25:42.611 --> 00:25:44.571
Though we do not want to sell ourselves,

00:25:44.611 --> 00:25:46.070
we have to know that

00:25:46.195 --> 00:25:50.611
unless and until we have some remarkable qualities,

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:53.611
people are not going to look at us,

00:25:53.611 --> 00:25:56.237
because whatever has happened is within ourselves,

00:25:56.487 --> 00:25:58.653
and nobody sees the light,

00:25:58.778 --> 00:26:04.611
it's like a light which is burning, which is covered completely.

00:26:06.321 --> 00:26:08.029
So I've seen that

00:26:08.154 --> 00:26:11.611
I went to Columbia. In Columbia, you'll be amazed

00:26:11.653 --> 00:26:13.820
that people had never known Me,

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:15.611
they had never heard My name,

00:26:15.695 --> 00:26:18.695
but I don't know why but

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:23.237
the crowds were so much that I couldn't enter into the compound

00:26:23.487 --> 00:26:26.279
and with somehow or other I was pushed into it.

00:26:26.529 --> 00:26:28.737
Then in the hall was impossible,

00:26:28.987 --> 00:26:31.611
people were hanging on the â€“

00:26:31.695 --> 00:26:33.404
I thought they were hanging

00:26:33.611 --> 00:26:35.529
from the top, just sitting on the thing to watch Me over.

00:26:35.611 --> 00:26:38.611
So many people in every direction, in every height

00:26:38.695 --> 00:26:42.945
I found people there, I did not know how to settle them down.

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:45.446
But they listened to Me very carefully this thing,

00:26:45.571 --> 00:26:49.029
two days we had the programmed, two days the crowds were there.

00:26:49.154 --> 00:26:52.571
And then when they had to follow-on they came,

00:26:52.611 --> 00:26:55.695
next day they disappeared.

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.404
Same thing in Greece,

00:26:57.529 --> 00:26:59.611
same thing in Turkey.

00:27:00.529 --> 00:27:07.279
So there's definitely something wrong with us.

00:27:07.611 --> 00:27:09.903
Now there's a course coming up,

00:27:10.029 --> 00:27:11.820
people are trying to do the course business,

00:27:11.945 --> 00:27:17.154
but one should know it is not knowledge without love,

00:27:17.279 --> 00:27:18.945
it is love and knowledge.

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:20.611
So how you talk to them,

00:27:20.778 --> 00:27:23.737
how you deal with them is there,

00:27:23.987 --> 00:27:27.237
but your dynamism is going to impress them.

00:27:27.778 --> 00:27:29.903
You can see the film we saw yesterday

00:27:30.195 --> 00:27:33.070
in which the music was there. Now what was it?

00:27:33.321 --> 00:27:35.611
There the energy was dynamic,

00:27:36.611 --> 00:27:39.778
the energy was dynamic, with the music and everything

00:27:40.029 --> 00:27:41.279
and that was showing.

00:27:41.404 --> 00:27:43.778
So you see you got engrossed into it,

00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:46.737
so the movement of that energy, the dynamism of that energy

00:27:47.154 --> 00:27:49.611
really got you engrossed.

00:27:51.611 --> 00:27:55.611
But to be afraid that you'll become right-sided is nonsensical,

00:27:55.611 --> 00:28:02.987
now you are in the center, how can you become right-sided?

00:28:06.529 --> 00:28:12.362
This kind of argument is only to support lethargy,

00:28:12.487 --> 00:28:15.029
then not to have any discipline.

00:28:15.321 --> 00:28:18.029
I was surprised that in Shudy Camp,

00:28:18.279 --> 00:28:22.778
where we have established a school for meditation,

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:25.612
people come every week-end just to spend the week-end,

00:28:25.737 --> 00:28:29.070
they get up at 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock,

00:28:29.195 --> 00:28:30.653
whenever they feel like,

00:28:30.778 --> 00:28:33.611
they are on holidays in Shudy Camp.

00:28:33.903 --> 00:28:38.571
And two days they'll stay there without any meditation,

00:28:38.611 --> 00:28:40.070
without anything.

00:28:40.195 --> 00:28:41.778
We have come to Mother's house, finished.

00:28:41.903 --> 00:28:46.321
Mother has to do all the job for them.

00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:50.279
I mean, for a Sahaja Yogi it is minimum of minimum

00:28:50.404 --> 00:28:52.029
that they should get up early in the morning,

00:28:52.279 --> 00:28:54.653
have their bath and sit down for pujas.

00:28:54.778 --> 00:28:58.653
Is a common thing, all Indians do that way,

00:28:59.154 --> 00:29:01.029
It's a practice.

00:29:01.154 --> 00:29:03.070
Suddenly this country

00:29:03.321 --> 00:29:06.903
or these countries have gone into a kind of a lethargic

00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:08.112
nonsensical life,

00:29:08.237 --> 00:29:12.571
otherwise this country also used to do the same thing.

00:29:13.195 --> 00:29:18.945
And sleeping also: you have to sleep early if you want to,

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:24.611
but one has to think that we have to change our lifestyle,

00:29:24.653 --> 00:29:27.611
we have to change our attitudes,

00:29:27.653 --> 00:29:32.195
so many things, see, like I said simple things, like I said,

00:29:32.321 --> 00:29:34.571
"The day you want to wash your hair,

00:29:34.611 --> 00:29:39.279
put lot of oil in your hair and then wash. We'll become bald."

00:29:39.404 --> 00:29:44.611
Imagine all bald Sahaja Yogis walking.

00:29:44.611 --> 00:29:50.611
They'll think your Mother has so many hair and what about your hair.

00:29:52.653 --> 00:29:56.279
In food also, too much, like

00:29:56.404 --> 00:29:59.237
I don't know here what is the situation, but in England I find

00:29:59.487 --> 00:30:01.611
they take so much of tea,

00:30:01.653 --> 00:30:05.611
all the time the tea is - the kettle is on the thing.

00:30:05.653 --> 00:30:08.321
I mean people are amazed

00:30:08.446 --> 00:30:11.695
when they, people come to Ganapatipule also in India,

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:14.611
we don't take tea so many times,

00:30:14.653 --> 00:30:16.611
I mean twice at the most.

00:30:16.611 --> 00:30:18.611
The whole day people want tea there,

00:30:18.611 --> 00:30:19.778
they don't understand

00:30:19.903 --> 00:30:25.571
how can they go on drinking tea at one o'clock in the night.

00:30:25.903 --> 00:30:35.778
It's like the alcohol has become subtler: tea ,

00:30:35.903 --> 00:30:39.611
otherwise how do you explain?

00:30:39.611 --> 00:30:42.611
You can't take alcohol, so let's have tea,

00:30:42.611 --> 00:30:45.820
then settle down nicely, we are having cup-o-tea,

00:30:45.945 --> 00:30:47.611
in England very common:

00:30:47.611 --> 00:30:50.945
sit down nicely, cup-o-tea.

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:56.571
What work have you done that you are settling down like that?

00:30:56.611 --> 00:31:01.404
Then whenever they'll come, "Haaa,"

00:31:01.529 --> 00:31:03.695
as if they have dug up something,

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:08.945
or they have done the English Channel,

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:11.611
they'll come, even on the television you'll see people,

00:31:11.611 --> 00:31:15.112
they come down, "Haa."

00:31:15.237 --> 00:31:17.070
I don't understand.

00:31:17.987 --> 00:31:20.112
You'll never find any Indian doing that,

00:31:20.237 --> 00:31:23.279
after all in that heat also, he'll never say that,

00:31:23.404 --> 00:31:26.695
because you think, think, think too much, just think,

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:30.029
don't do anything about it.

00:31:30.737 --> 00:31:33.611
Like you file, you see, make a file,

00:31:33.611 --> 00:31:35.529
tomorrow is Mother's puja, all right,

00:31:35.611 --> 00:31:37.611
we'll have this, this, this - filed it.

00:31:37.695 --> 00:31:42.487
At the puja it is not there, why? It's in the file.

00:31:45.778 --> 00:31:54.611
And anything that is before your Realization,

00:31:54.611 --> 00:32:00.029
like people have an idea,

00:31:58.571 --> 00:32:04.611
Labor saving is a very great asset of the Western people.

00:32:00.154 --> 00:32:00.154
like this how to avoid work, you see, labor saving.

00:32:04.653 --> 00:32:06.279
So the labor saving how they will do.

00:32:06.404 --> 00:32:08.611
Supposing, you say, "Please, telephone to such a person."

00:32:08.695 --> 00:32:11.070
"Mother, I think he may not be there."

00:32:11.195 --> 00:32:14.778
"Baba, you telephone and find out."

00:32:15.529 --> 00:32:18.611
So the explanation comes from the brain,

00:32:18.611 --> 00:32:23.112
it may not. So nothing can be achieved.

00:32:23.237 --> 00:32:25.611
So first the labor saving was that

00:32:25.611 --> 00:32:29.862
"Oh, this is anti-culture, we should be â€“

00:32:29.987 --> 00:32:32.112
this is so bad, everything is so bad,

00:32:32.237 --> 00:32:34.862
we should start a very natural life,

00:32:34.987 --> 00:32:37.820
we should lead a very natural thing and that

00:32:37.945 --> 00:32:41.571
we should become primitive," and all that.

00:32:42.404 --> 00:32:47.611
From that if you grow in - from that area if you grow into Sahaja Yoga,

00:32:47.695 --> 00:32:49.903
you become subtler.

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:55.154
So the subtler things that they become is this way:

00:32:55.279 --> 00:32:59.611
that now as it is, you see,

00:33:00.446 --> 00:33:05.112
"We should not do too much of everything, is too much, you see,

00:33:05.237 --> 00:33:07.237
it is too much."

00:33:08.154 --> 00:33:11.195
If you talk to somebody about Sahaja Yoga, they say,

00:33:11.611 --> 00:33:13.611
"It's too much for me."

00:33:13.611 --> 00:33:15.820
Hey, you have no brain or what is it?

00:33:15.945 --> 00:33:19.404
What is too much? Can't take it?

00:33:19.529 --> 00:33:21.612
"Oh it's too much."

00:33:21.737 --> 00:33:25.279
It's a very common experience with Me,

00:33:25.404 --> 00:33:28.695
that when I talk to people they would say, "It's too much."

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:32.279
I mean your brain, is it a limited brain

00:33:32.404 --> 00:33:37.695
or what is it that you can't listen to Me what I am trying to tell you?

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:42.154
And once you start developing this kind of attitude,

00:33:42.571 --> 00:33:44.279
the nourishment cannot reach you,

00:33:44.404 --> 00:33:47.611
supposing the trees say, "Oh it's too much,"

00:33:47.903 --> 00:33:51.695
then what are they going to do?

00:33:53.695 --> 00:33:56.279
Nothing is too much.

00:33:56.404 --> 00:33:59.279
"I have to grow, I have to take all the nourishment,

00:33:59.404 --> 00:34:02.446
I have to become something,

00:34:02.571 --> 00:34:05.611
I have to do such a lot.

00:34:05.611 --> 00:34:06.611
What have I done?"

00:34:06.653 --> 00:34:12.154
Nothing so far. Never be satisfied with yourself.

00:34:12.279 --> 00:34:15.154
I mean, some people who saw My program

00:34:15.279 --> 00:34:18.070
they were all shocked how Mother is going to do it.

00:34:18.195 --> 00:34:23.695
I said, "I know I am going to do it, if I have to do it, I'll do it."

00:34:28.737 --> 00:34:30.903
So this is what should be attitude:

00:34:31.029 --> 00:34:38.070
when you love Me I am your ideal. You must know that.

00:34:38.195 --> 00:34:42.529
If you love Me, then what are you doing about it?

00:34:42.611 --> 00:34:55.070
I am your ideal. You have to reach My style,

00:34:57.695 --> 00:35:01.362
otherwise Sahaja Yoga won't work out in these countries

00:35:01.487 --> 00:35:08.029
which have taken to lethargy as a great culture.

00:35:08.404 --> 00:35:10.695
I asked somebody, "What about your bathing,

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:12.112
why didn't you take bath?"

00:35:12.237 --> 00:35:16.778
He said, "These days it is out of fashion to take bath."

00:35:17.404 --> 00:35:22.778
Everything seems to be out of fashion, whatever is in fashion is horrid.

00:35:23.321 --> 00:35:25.862
"It's very fashionable," is another thing people say,

00:35:25.987 --> 00:35:28.029
"it's very fashionable,"

00:35:28.154 --> 00:35:31.945
and whatever is fashionable looks so ugly to Me.

00:35:33.695 --> 00:35:36.695
Now if you have to take to the Sahaj culture,

00:35:36.945 --> 00:35:40.778
you have to know that we have to have a discipline in our life.

00:35:41.029 --> 00:35:43.195
We have to have education, we have to have a place,

00:35:43.321 --> 00:35:47.778
we have to have a position in the society.

00:35:47.903 --> 00:35:50.571
Because we are not sitting in the Himalayas,

00:35:50.611 --> 00:35:54.611
somewhere lost in the Himalayas sitting there

00:35:54.611 --> 00:36:00.279
and just doing our Tapasya.

00:36:00.404 --> 00:36:08.404
Tapasya is here where you live.

00:36:08.529 --> 00:36:12.571
Otherwise if you say that "All right we have to go to Himalayas

00:36:12.611 --> 00:36:16.321
and there we have to do Tapasya in the cold winds.

00:36:16.446 --> 00:36:18.070
Oh, that's very good."

00:36:18.195 --> 00:36:20.195
Because that looks like something, you see,

00:36:20.321 --> 00:36:23.362
you might have a name, or something like that.

00:36:23.487 --> 00:36:25.404
But Tapasya is here,

00:36:25.529 --> 00:36:27.945
the detachment has to be worked out here.

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:31.029
You get involved into all these things,

00:36:31.154 --> 00:36:33.862
in a way sometimes surprises Me,

00:36:33.987 --> 00:36:37.112
the amount of involvement you have

00:36:37.237 --> 00:36:44.321
in the things which existed in gross form,

00:36:44.446 --> 00:36:47.820
they have become subtler and you are still bound by them,

00:36:47.945 --> 00:36:52.611
there's no freedom.

00:36:56.195 --> 00:36:59.611
And that's why when you see something absurd happening,

00:36:59.611 --> 00:37:02.404
you see something funny happening in Sahaja Yoga,

00:37:02.529 --> 00:37:06.279
it's just the symptom of that thing becoming subtler

00:37:06.404 --> 00:37:11.611
within us and its expressing itself.

00:37:12.446 --> 00:37:14.529
Like sometimes you may not see fire

00:37:14.611 --> 00:37:21.611
but it exists and suddenly you find a blast.

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:28.446
So transformation of course means evolution,

00:37:28.571 --> 00:37:29.611
it also means that whatever basis you had,

00:37:29.653 --> 00:37:31.611
you have to evolve out of it.

00:37:31.611 --> 00:37:40.446
Like a flower blossoming and then becoming the fruit,

00:37:40.571 --> 00:37:45.903
but it has to drop out many things.

00:37:47.611 --> 00:37:53.611
And then with the nature one has to see such a unison.

00:37:55.529 --> 00:38:01.820
In the nature if you see, it sucks the water.

00:38:01.945 --> 00:38:07.321
Then the water is evaporated by the sun.

00:38:07.446 --> 00:38:16.611
Then it becomes a cloud and then the cloud waits,

00:38:16.611 --> 00:38:19.154
because the leaves drop out.

00:38:19.279 --> 00:38:26.154
In the winter time they nourish the tree with their nitrogen;

00:38:26.279 --> 00:38:28.611
when the time is ready,

00:38:28.611 --> 00:38:35.611
then these clouds pour down and again nourish this.

00:38:35.653 --> 00:38:41.029
Such a complete balance is in the nature.

00:38:41.154 --> 00:38:45.195
If it was not, I tell you they would, we would, have said,

00:38:45.321 --> 00:38:49.903
"all bald headed lands here."

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:55.862
If you go to any, any forest, any forest, it's so clean,

00:38:55.987 --> 00:39:00.321
you never have any bad smell anywhere whatsoever.

00:39:00.446 --> 00:39:03.611
There are animals, there are tigers, that, this â€“

00:39:03.611 --> 00:39:06.321
never get any smell anywhere,

00:39:06.446 --> 00:39:08.112
you never even get the smell of a tiger.

00:39:08.237 --> 00:39:13.446
But if you put the tiger in a cage then he starts smelling,

00:39:13.571 --> 00:39:16.862
he's so much bathed in the nature, he lives with the nature,

00:39:16.987 --> 00:39:20.903
and in such balance.

00:39:21.029 --> 00:39:24.404
It's such an understanding among all the animals, everything.

00:39:24.529 --> 00:39:28.279
I don't know how they keep it so clean,

00:39:28.404 --> 00:39:32.112
but as soon as you get some smell,

00:39:32.237 --> 00:39:38.611
you will find out there must be some human being somewhere,

00:39:39.029 --> 00:39:43.279
or some untidiness.

00:39:43.404 --> 00:39:48.195
It's so organized how the leaves grow according to the sun's rays,

00:39:48.321 --> 00:39:49.945
how they organize themselves,

00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:54.571
how they build up themselves.

00:39:54.611 --> 00:39:58.446
So if you really have to get to the nature of Sahaja Yoga,

00:39:58.571 --> 00:40:03.029
we should get all these blessings

00:40:03.154 --> 00:40:05.862
by which we should prosper.

00:40:05.987 --> 00:40:12.820
Not, I mean in money and things, but in every way.

00:40:13.237 --> 00:40:19.446
So it should not be a set of people who are just sort of parasites.

00:40:21.611 --> 00:40:28.112
And I wish for you that you understand what I am saying today

00:40:28.237 --> 00:40:31.611
and I request you, all of you,

00:40:31.611 --> 00:40:34.612
to be alert and dynamic

00:40:34.737 --> 00:40:36.903
and work it out.

00:40:37.029 --> 00:40:39.195
Each single person has to come up.

00:40:39.321 --> 00:40:42.653
It's not going to work out if you wear some saffron clothes

00:40:42.778 --> 00:40:45.695
and go on singing "Hare Rama, Hare Krishna" on the street.

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:51.945
No. It's not going to work out.

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:54.112
Nor it is going to work out if you say,

00:40:54.237 --> 00:40:57.611
"We are Sahaja Yogis, we are such people and this and that."

00:40:57.695 --> 00:41:02.362
Nothing. You have to be something.

00:41:02.487 --> 00:41:06.820
So on one side, the dynamism is to be used for yourself

00:41:06.945 --> 00:41:12.611
and the dynamism is to be used for Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:12.611 --> 00:41:18.154
You need not now worry about right-sidedness.

00:41:18.487 --> 00:41:20.611
Is very common even in ...

00:41:20.611 --> 00:41:23.446
This happened: I found in Holland

00:41:23.571 --> 00:41:28.611
that I married one girl, very dynamic girl, to someone

00:41:28.653 --> 00:41:32.112
and the husband said, "Mother, she doesn't help me."

00:41:32.237 --> 00:41:33.611
I said, "Why?"

00:41:33.611 --> 00:41:36.611
"Because I'm afraid I'll become right-sided."

00:41:36.611 --> 00:41:40.778
I said, "But why did I marry you to this left-sided fellow?

00:41:40.903 --> 00:41:43.404
That you become left-sided?"

00:41:43.529 --> 00:41:45.279
Left-sided is a very good thing

00:41:45.404 --> 00:41:48.154
because you don't have to do anything, just you have to say,

00:41:48.279 --> 00:41:57.321
"I don't want to become right-sided," that's all.

00:41:57.446 --> 00:42:00.362
But right-sidedness means you have to look,

00:42:00.487 --> 00:42:03.446
you have to be alert, you have to be clever

00:42:03.571 --> 00:42:08.611
and you have to know everything.

00:42:08.611 --> 00:42:11.695
You'll sit in the sun, burn your skins,

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:14.279
but look at the sun.

00:42:14.404 --> 00:42:21.529
Are you on the sun line or on the moon line?

00:42:21.611 --> 00:42:27.611
So the swing of all the Western people is on the left hand side.

00:42:27.611 --> 00:42:37.529
Drinking, pubs, like in 24 hours they sleep,

00:42:37.611 --> 00:42:39.195
say maybe fourteen hours,

00:42:39.321 --> 00:42:39.321
maybe eighteen hours,

00:42:40.611 --> 00:42:44.653
rest of the time they drink, that's all.

00:42:44.778 --> 00:42:49.070
We have one house being built next to us,

00:42:49.446 --> 00:42:50.778
when we shifted there, they said,

00:42:50.903 --> 00:42:53.653
"This is practically finished now" - still finishing

00:42:53.778 --> 00:42:55.945
and will take at least three years more maybe,

00:42:56.070 --> 00:42:57.611
may never finish.

00:42:57.653 --> 00:43:01.070
It's like the mathematics, you see, you have this

00:43:01.195 --> 00:43:04.611
that there was a work and somebody came,

00:43:04.695 --> 00:43:07.112
he did one tenth and ran away.

00:43:07.237 --> 00:43:09.820
Then somebody came did one twentieth and ran away.

00:43:09.945 --> 00:43:12.362
Then somebody came he did one fortieth and ran away.

00:43:12.487 --> 00:43:14.611
When will the work finish? It will never finish,

00:43:14.611 --> 00:43:18.611
with such running away people, never finish.

00:43:18.695 --> 00:43:20.778
Same thing is Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:20.903 --> 00:43:22.446
If you put mathematically,

00:43:22.571 --> 00:43:24.778
Sahaja Yoga can never be established in America,

00:43:24.903 --> 00:43:32.112
if you add up more and more of this kind of people.

00:43:32.237 --> 00:43:34.446
So much is happening in this country,

00:43:34.571 --> 00:43:36.195
but you have to see those people, you have to meet those people

00:43:36.321 --> 00:43:41.446
who are at the helm of affairs, who are the people who matter,

00:43:41.571 --> 00:43:46.070
who are scientific, who are talking about something sensible.

00:43:46.195 --> 00:43:50.653
You have to talk to them, get to them.

00:43:53.029 --> 00:43:55.612
We don't need cinema actors and actresses,

00:43:55.737 --> 00:43:59.446
but we need people who are dynamic.

00:43:59.571 --> 00:44:01.195
And this may work out

00:44:01.321 --> 00:44:05.487
if you put your minds to it and we have something to show them.

00:44:08.404 --> 00:44:10.321
I would say that Austria is one place

00:44:10.446 --> 00:44:12.362
where Sahaja Yoga has worked very well,

00:44:12.487 --> 00:44:17.820
Milan is another place and where most of them are professionals.

00:44:18.987 --> 00:44:23.611
It's very surprising, in modern times we are living.

00:44:23.695 --> 00:44:25.903
We are not living in those ancient times

00:44:26.029 --> 00:44:30.112
where the Rishi Munis used to sit under a tree

00:44:30.237 --> 00:44:35.112
and the kings used to come and touch their feet.

00:44:35.237 --> 00:44:36.778
Is the other way round;

00:44:36.903 --> 00:44:43.611
the Rishi Munis have to go and talk to the kings.

00:44:44.903 --> 00:44:48.195
So when we believe that we are Sahaja Yogis

00:44:48.321 --> 00:44:50.279
we have to know that in a subtle way

00:44:50.404 --> 00:44:52.154
we are still caught up into the webs of

00:44:52.279 --> 00:44:57.611
our own understanding about life. So, that we have to change.

00:44:57.611 --> 00:45:01.321
Life for us is nothing but Sahaja Yoga

00:45:01.446 --> 00:45:11.237
and Sahaja Yoga is nothing but enlightening ourselves and others.

00:45:12.321 --> 00:45:16.611
So I hope you will listen to My lecture today,

00:45:16.611 --> 00:45:19.611
you will take the tapes home and listen to them

00:45:19.611 --> 00:45:21.321
again and again.

00:45:21.446 --> 00:45:24.279
Also there's a warning from people that

00:45:24.404 --> 00:45:31.571
"Mother, what they do is to take one tape for one center

00:45:31.611 --> 00:45:34.611
and everybody listens it and then finished."

00:45:34.653 --> 00:45:40.404
Meaning, you all should have one tape each.

00:45:40.529 --> 00:45:42.903
Even that, people don't do.

00:45:43.029 --> 00:45:45.611
Not only that, but now it might be after some time

00:45:45.611 --> 00:45:52.611
only one, one tape in circulation in one country.

00:45:52.695 --> 00:45:56.321
They circulate; say, today in New York, tomorrow in Boston,

00:45:56.446 --> 00:46:01.112
like that. You have to listen to it again and again.

00:46:01.237 --> 00:46:03.611
Sit down with your paper and pencil,

00:46:03.611 --> 00:46:05.611
see for yourself what I am saying.

00:46:05.695 --> 00:46:08.362
Every tape should be with you.

00:46:08.487 --> 00:46:10.611
I mean, these horrible gurus' tapes

00:46:10.611 --> 00:46:14.612
you can hear them in every car, in every place,

00:46:14.737 --> 00:46:17.611
everyone they have it.

00:46:17.653 --> 00:46:22.571
And why is it Sahaja Yogis don't have any tapes with them?

00:46:22.611 --> 00:46:26.611
You can make copies.

00:46:28.237 --> 00:46:31.529
But if you can get it free, they'll like to have.

00:46:31.611 --> 00:46:37.945
That's the first thing, what we can get free, cheaply, easily.

00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:44.404
If you try to save money, the money tries to save itself.

00:46:44.529 --> 00:46:51.070
It's a mutual understanding.

00:46:54.279 --> 00:46:57.612
It's as simple as this: supposing you open only one door,

00:46:57.737 --> 00:46:58.820
no air will come in.

00:46:58.945 --> 00:47:01.695
You open the other door the air will start flowing.

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:06.237
It's a circulation.

00:47:07.778 --> 00:47:10.362
All this can be your own knowledge too,

00:47:10.487 --> 00:47:13.571
I need not say anything, this is all in your brains,

00:47:13.611 --> 00:47:16.612
only open out yourself, you are not free people.

00:47:16.737 --> 00:47:18.362
If you are free like Me,

00:47:18.487 --> 00:47:23.945
you'll see all these things coming from your own brains.

00:47:24.611 --> 00:47:28.862
Specially for America, really, as you know, I am working very hard

00:47:28.987 --> 00:47:31.653
and I want to work it out because,

00:47:31.778 --> 00:47:35.154
if America is not all right, My Vishuddhi is not going to be all right.

00:47:35.279 --> 00:47:39.611
It's going to trouble Me throughout.

00:47:39.695 --> 00:47:44.820
So you have to take it up upon yourself.

00:47:44.945 --> 00:47:51.029
I don't say, "Take the cross."

00:47:51.154 --> 00:47:53.820
You don't have to sacrifice anything,

00:47:53.945 --> 00:48:01.029
but you have to be just aware about what are we,

00:48:01.154 --> 00:48:04.653
what are we doing, where are we?

00:48:04.778 --> 00:48:07.195
And on top of that,

00:48:07.321 --> 00:48:13.154
Sahaja Yogis think they are obliging Sahaja Yoga and Me too.

00:48:13.611 --> 00:48:18.529
This is something. It's to be explained this way:

00:48:18.611 --> 00:48:21.154
I don't need Sahaja Yoga, you need Sahaja Yoga

00:48:21.279 --> 00:48:23.529
and everybody needs Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:23.611 --> 00:48:25.820
You had in this country people like,

00:48:25.945 --> 00:48:28.362
I mean such great, great people you had

00:48:28.487 --> 00:48:31.820
I need not mention - persons like Abraham Lincoln

00:48:31.945 --> 00:48:38.070
who gave such great ideas to the whole world.

00:48:39.321 --> 00:48:41.653
Why not you people be great?

00:48:41.778 --> 00:48:43.611
He was a realized soul, all right,

00:48:43.611 --> 00:48:50.612
but he didn't know anything about Ida, Pingala and Sushumna.

00:48:50.737 --> 00:48:55.529
Why can't you become great like him?

00:49:00.195 --> 00:49:03.279
So on a Virata Puja we have to decide

00:49:03.529 --> 00:49:06.611
that we are all going to express

00:49:06.611 --> 00:49:12.154
the conception that was once the Virat

00:49:12.279 --> 00:49:14.611
as reality in our lives.

00:49:14.695 --> 00:49:21.611
This is what we have to pray from our heart.

00:49:22.487 --> 00:49:26.279
And it's a very good occasion today to do that,

00:49:26.404 --> 00:49:30.154
because we are sitting in a place where there were

00:49:30.279 --> 00:49:36.945
so many of these aboriginal people, you call them, anything.

00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:40.529
They were so sensible,

00:49:40.611 --> 00:49:44.321
as in America you say brass tacks, you see.

00:49:44.446 --> 00:49:52.611
They knew the principle how to lead a real spiritual life.

00:49:52.653 --> 00:49:57.154
They were very free people, extremely free

00:49:57.611 --> 00:50:01.279
and so detached.

00:50:01.404 --> 00:50:03.611
So if you do not correct yourself,

00:50:03.695 --> 00:50:05.945
then there will be a problem on collectivity.

00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:07.612
If there's a problem in collectivity,

00:50:07.737 --> 00:50:10.195
it will reflect on you,

00:50:10.321 --> 00:50:13.362
because you are part and parcel of the whole.

00:50:13.487 --> 00:50:16.321
If there's a problem in the whole being

00:50:16.446 --> 00:50:18.154
there's a problem for you.

00:50:18.279 --> 00:50:20.029
And if there's a problem in one part,

00:50:20.154 --> 00:50:22.446
there's a problem for the whole being.

00:50:22.571 --> 00:50:25.612
Even Roosevelt who was your president once said that

00:50:25.737 --> 00:50:29.279
"Poverty anywhere is a threat to prosperity everywhere."

00:50:29.404 --> 00:50:33.778
He could see this point so clearly.

00:50:33.903 --> 00:50:36.070
You see, all these sayings show us

00:50:36.195 --> 00:50:39.029
that this is a country of Virat,

00:50:39.154 --> 00:50:40.611
where they talk of collectivity,

00:50:40.611 --> 00:50:44.529
they have all the communications

00:50:44.611 --> 00:50:46.404
which are important.

00:50:46.529 --> 00:50:48.611
Every sort of communication is important,

00:50:48.653 --> 00:50:49.820
but for Sahaja Yogis

00:50:49.945 --> 00:50:53.446
it has to be very subtle, very dynamic,

00:50:53.571 --> 00:50:55.529
very beautiful, very loving,

00:50:55.611 --> 00:50:59.820
very impressive, magnetic.

00:50:59.945 --> 00:51:04.321
Then only the communications will work.

00:51:04.446 --> 00:51:08.611
There's no harm in wearing very nice dresses.

00:51:08.611 --> 00:51:13.820
There's no harm in wearing - nice doesn't mean expensive,

00:51:13.945 --> 00:51:21.611
but means which are sensible, dignified.

00:51:21.611 --> 00:51:25.070
We have to build up our personalities,

00:51:25.195 --> 00:51:33.945
that people should feel that "Oh, this is something, eh."

00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:39.903
And your children will also learn from you.

00:51:40.029 --> 00:51:42.695
There's no question of feeling that

00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:43.404
you'll be driven into ego or anything,

00:51:43.611 --> 00:51:51.653
that's finished now, ego is finished here, there's no ego.

00:51:51.778 --> 00:51:56.362
What I find here is a justification

00:51:56.487 --> 00:51:57.612
for doing nothing

00:51:57.737 --> 00:52:05.321
that we do not want to do anything because our ego will come up.

00:52:05.446 --> 00:52:12.279
Very clever.

00:52:15.778 --> 00:52:19.154
So with all this one has to know

00:52:19.279 --> 00:52:21.903
that we are selected people,

00:52:22.029 --> 00:52:25.321
we are chosen people of God.

00:52:25.446 --> 00:52:27.612
He must have selected us with some purpose,

00:52:27.737 --> 00:52:31.321
otherwise there are so many people in this country.

00:52:31.446 --> 00:52:35.321
You are the foundation and you have to be solid people

00:52:35.446 --> 00:52:37.611
to be the foundation.

00:52:38.778 --> 00:52:41.362
Must know our own glory,

00:52:41.487 --> 00:52:44.571
our own speciality

00:52:44.611 --> 00:52:47.154
that why we are selected,

00:52:47.279 --> 00:52:50.112
of all the people why are we there?

00:52:50.237 --> 00:52:56.529
Then, what are we doing about it?

00:52:56.611 --> 00:52:58.611
Normal life you do see that way,

00:52:58.611 --> 00:53:01.903
like if somebody is selected for a post or something,

00:53:02.029 --> 00:53:04.612
out of many, many things, "Oh must be something about me,

00:53:04.737 --> 00:53:07.571
I must show my worth, I must show my value,

00:53:07.611 --> 00:53:09.611
I must show my work," you see,

00:53:09.611 --> 00:53:16.404
and he works hard to prove that the selection was good.

00:53:16.529 --> 00:53:19.446
But in Sahaja Yoga it's the other way round,

00:53:19.571 --> 00:53:21.653
you take it for granted,

00:53:21.778 --> 00:53:24.195
"Oh, we are something great."

00:53:24.321 --> 00:53:31.195
So now settle down with yourself - have a cup of tea.

00:53:34.737 --> 00:53:39.154
I hope it has been understood why I am saying so,

00:53:39.279 --> 00:53:42.362
because I am really concerned about America.

00:53:42.487 --> 00:53:44.611
So many negative forces are working here

00:53:44.695 --> 00:53:49.611
and we have to improve.

00:53:50.695 --> 00:53:53.820
So many things such a big responsibility,

00:53:53.945 --> 00:53:56.778
such a big country, such a vast country,

00:53:56.903 --> 00:54:05.195
so much perversion, so much nonsensical ideologies,

00:54:05.321 --> 00:54:08.529
I mean endless.

00:54:08.611 --> 00:54:14.446
Even if you get fifteen Gorbachevs, you cannot change this country.

00:54:15.279 --> 00:54:17.945
It has gone amuck.

00:54:18.070 --> 00:54:20.611
Everybody's an individual,

00:54:20.611 --> 00:54:23.112
this mad place.

00:54:23.237 --> 00:54:26.279
One Gorbachev can change that country

00:54:26.404 --> 00:54:28.778
which has much more population.

00:54:28.903 --> 00:54:30.820
But no one can change this country

00:54:30.945 --> 00:54:36.070
unless and until you people decide to do something about it.

00:54:37.778 --> 00:54:40.195
So I'm told some people are frustrated

00:54:40.321 --> 00:54:42.945
because there are not so many Sahaja Yogis are coming,

00:54:43.070 --> 00:54:45.404
but may be something wrong with you.

00:54:45.529 --> 00:54:47.112
Maybe that you are not deep enough

00:54:47.237 --> 00:54:52.487
and that you are not so much impressive.

00:54:54.695 --> 00:54:57.029
You have to change your life style,

00:54:57.154 --> 00:55:04.945
you have to be smart people and spartan.

00:55:05.987 --> 00:55:11.612
I hope, I hope again and again that after this Virata's Puja

00:55:11.737 --> 00:55:15.778
you all will come up on the stage as great Viratas.

00:55:15.945 --> 00:55:17.611
May God bless you all.
