WEBVTT

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:33.779
- I bow to all the seekers of Truth.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:40.379
As I told you yesterday that Truth is not a concept

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.659
- [INTERPRETER]

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:51.639
When people start establishing something as Truth

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:55.619
- [INTERPRETER]

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:01.279
- there arises the problem
- [INTERPRETER]

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:08.919
because Truth cannot be organized,

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:16.139
cannot be ordered, cannot be changed - it is what it is.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.999
- [INTERPRETER]

00:04:24.679 --> 00:04:30.779
And today the Truth is, that the time has come

00:04:31.679 --> 00:04:34.819
for people to get their resurrection,

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:43.159
- [INTERPRETER]

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:49.339
that the time has come where people have to ascend to their higher being.

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:56.319
- [INTERPRETER]

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:03.499
As in Koran described very clearly, is Kiama - is the time of resurrection.

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:09.459
- [INTERPRETER]

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:15.279
Said very clearly, that your hands will speak

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.019
- [INTERPRETER]

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:24.499
- and they will give witness about.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:30.919
- This is time of Last Judgment.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:37.679
God is not going to weigh people to judge them.

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:42.659
- [INTERPRETER]

00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:50.079
It is you only, in your ascent, are going to judge yourself.

00:05:50.619 --> 00:05:53.979
- [INTERPRETER]

00:05:54.779 --> 00:06:02.739
And there are people who are a special category today, who are seeking something higher.

00:06:03.179 --> 00:06:09.199
- [INTERPRETER]

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:18.679
- Now, yesterday a question was raised about the religion part.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:23.959
All these religions which have come on this earth,

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:28.819
are product of Divine force.

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:34.279
- [INTERPRETER]

00:06:35.179 --> 00:06:40.879
All the prophets and Incarnations, all of them came on this earth

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:46.799
to propound a special milestone within us.

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:53.619
- [INTERPRETER]

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:01.979
On the tree of life, all of them grew one after another

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:07.379
- [INTERPRETER]
- but people

00:07:11.119 --> 00:07:18.879
took out or removed them from the tree of life saying, "This is my religion, this is my religion."

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:26.339
- [INTERPRETER]

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:32.639
- So believing into something that is dead.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:39.839
So, what we see today, is a mess

00:07:41.219 --> 00:07:47.919
- [INTERPRETER]
- and people can't understand
- [INTERPRETER]

00:07:48.359 --> 00:07:56.559
- how those who profess a particular religion
- [INTERPRETER]
- act just the opposite of it.

00:07:57.059 --> 00:08:04.499
- [INTERPRETER]
- I've seen people who live, say, in Riyadh -

00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:12.379
- [INTERPRETER]
- they don't drink, they don't look at women because they're frightened - their eyes

00:08:12.599 --> 00:08:18.919
will be pierced through or they will be put in the jail, if they do these things.

00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:23.019
- [INTERPRETER]

00:08:23.339 --> 00:08:27.819
- [INTERPRETER]

00:08:28.059 --> 00:08:32.459
- but when they come to London, they drink like nobody's business.

00:08:32.999 --> 00:08:36.439
- [INTERPRETER]

00:08:36.759 --> 00:08:42.159
They have all kinds of relationships which are very ugly.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:49.259
- [INTERPRETER]
- What happens to them that under fear

00:08:50.119 --> 00:08:55.799
they work this way and under freedom they behave in a different manner.

00:08:56.339 --> 00:09:04.159
- [INTERPRETER]

00:09:04.719 --> 00:09:10.199
- Same we can say about political theories.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:09:11.239 --> 00:09:15.939
I went to Russia and Russian people in Russia

00:09:16.299 --> 00:09:20.139
are quite alright under fear

00:09:20.899 --> 00:09:28.939
- [INTERPRETER]
- but when they are given freedom

00:09:29.739 --> 00:09:37.059
- when they are given freedom they behave like anybody else.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:09:37.859 --> 00:09:40.939
And also in America if you go,

00:09:41.999 --> 00:09:46.559
the freedom of people is abandonment.

00:09:47.859 --> 00:09:52.879
[INTERPRETER]

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:59.279
You can't walk on the street of New York with your purse in your hand.

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:03.899
[INTERPRETER]

00:10:04.419 --> 00:10:08.059
- They're all crazy people there.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:10:08.819 --> 00:10:15.939
- Uh... they're so immature,
- [INTERPRETER]
- worse than children even.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:10:16.539 --> 00:10:20.859
- Sometimes you can't understand them.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:10:21.459 --> 00:10:28.139
About two years back we saw a feature from Hollywood

00:10:29.359 --> 00:10:32.799
where they showed, very old -

00:10:33.199 --> 00:10:37.719
about eighty - all the actors and actresses coming for a dance.

00:10:38.299 --> 00:10:44.339
[INTERPRETER]

00:10:44.599 --> 00:10:49.979
They were very stupidly dressed with all their bones showing

00:10:50.359 --> 00:10:53.559
[INTERPRETER]

00:10:54.259 --> 00:10:59.599
- and they had come for a shake dance.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:11:00.119 --> 00:11:05.639
Right from the Limousine when they were getting out they were already shaking.

00:11:05.919 --> 00:11:10.219
[INTERPRETER]

00:11:10.839 --> 00:11:17.179
- So they try to compete with the young.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:11:17.999 --> 00:11:23.659
- So there is no maturity in their freedom.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:11:24.039 --> 00:11:31.939
Is such an abandonment of all the value system, all relationships, such impurities!

00:11:32.379 --> 00:11:35.919
[INTERPRETER]

00:11:37.179 --> 00:11:44.959
I went there in the year 1973 and told them about this AIDS will be coming very soon.

00:11:45.539 --> 00:11:51.179
- Well
- [INTERPRETER]

00:11:51.459 --> 00:11:59.239
- and all the homosexuals were so angry with Me - they were about to beat Me
- [INTERPRETER]

00:11:59.999 --> 00:12:06.379
and even today, it's a martyrdom there for them to get this disease.

00:12:07.379 --> 00:12:12.019
[INTERPRETER]

00:12:12.359 --> 00:12:18.139
- Schizophrenic are so common.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:12:18.359 --> 00:12:22.639
- So what's the use of this freedom?
- [INTERPRETER]

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:29.339
- Man has no wisdom to use his freedom
- [INTERPRETER]

00:12:29.899 --> 00:12:33.739
nor has he any wisdom to use his money.

00:12:34.139 --> 00:12:38.059
[INTERPRETER]

00:12:38.259 --> 00:12:43.779
Anybody who gets an extra money, he goes to something which is self-destructive.

00:12:44.239 --> 00:12:48.679
[INTERPRETER]

00:12:49.839 --> 00:12:55.039
The wisdom is so much lacking; There's no discrimination also

00:12:56.159 --> 00:13:03.439
- [INTERPRETER]
- to decide what is right for you and what is wrong for you.

00:13:03.779 --> 00:13:07.819
- [INTERPRETER]

00:13:08.299 --> 00:13:14.479
So, under these circumstances, the religions, so called, also have to take the shape.

00:13:15.459 --> 00:13:19.919
- [INTERPRETER]

00:13:20.659 --> 00:13:23.959
They are not religions in any way because

00:13:24.879 --> 00:13:28.999
there is no enlightenment within.

00:13:29.599 --> 00:13:33.419
- [INTERPRETER]

00:13:33.819 --> 00:13:37.419
- You do not become anything.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:13:37.999 --> 00:13:43.999
In Sahaja yoga, we have Jews, we have Muslims, we have Christians, we have Hindus -

00:13:44.299 --> 00:13:50.479
- people coming from all sides.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:13:50.999 --> 00:13:55.619
- [INTERPRETER]
- but

00:13:56.739 --> 00:14:02.519
- they do not fight, they do not quarrel,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:14:03.339 --> 00:14:08.899
- there is no hankering after positions
- [INTERPRETER]

00:14:09.459 --> 00:14:14.479
- because they can see themselves clearly.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:14:14.819 --> 00:14:22.659
- and they can see others also very clearly
- [INTERPRETER]
- This is wisdom.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:14:23.599 --> 00:14:28.759
- In the animal kingdom no animal kills another animal.

00:14:29.319 --> 00:14:34.479
- [INTERPRETER]
- Even a tiger doesn't kill another tiger

00:14:34.859 --> 00:14:41.739
- [INTERPRETER]
- There are certain qualities of a tiger, will remain with the tiger

00:14:42.279 --> 00:14:46.659
[INTERPRETER]

00:14:46.899 --> 00:14:51.019
But human-beings are so unpredictable because of their sense of freedom;

00:14:51.279 --> 00:14:55.759
They could be a scorpion one day, tomorrow a tiger and third a serpent.

00:14:56.659 --> 00:14:59.759
[INTERPRETER]

00:15:00.079 --> 00:15:05.099
[INTERPRETER]

00:15:05.719 --> 00:15:11.519
What is the reason for this kind of absurd behaviour?

00:15:12.379 --> 00:15:15.819
[INTERPRETER]

00:15:16.279 --> 00:15:20.699
The reason is that we live with rationality

00:15:21.539 --> 00:15:27.079
- [INTERPRETER]
- and not with logic.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:15:27.619 --> 00:15:31.559
A, even if somebody murders someone, there's a rationality behind it.

00:15:32.439 --> 00:15:36.219
[INTERPRETER]

00:15:37.719 --> 00:15:43.079
The logic can only come when you have achieved an Absolute sense.

00:15:43.639 --> 00:15:48.879
[INTERPRETER]

00:15:49.439 --> 00:15:53.879
As you see here the flowers - everybody sees they're flowers here.

00:15:54.879 --> 00:15:58.839
[INTERPRETER]

00:15:59.059 --> 00:16:03.259
Nobody is going to quarrel with them, whether it is flower or fruit

00:16:04.199 --> 00:16:08.099
[INTERPRETER]

00:16:08.479 --> 00:16:14.719
because they see it, absolutely they know it is flowers, everyone knows they are flowers.

00:16:15.079 --> 00:16:19.979
[INTERPRETER]

00:16:20.859 --> 00:16:26.479
In the same way, unless and until you have knowledge of propriety,

00:16:26.859 --> 00:16:31.659
of right and wrong, how will you say what is right, what is wrong.

00:16:31.919 --> 00:16:39.739
[INTERPRETER]

00:16:40.279 --> 00:16:46.539
- One goes on compromising
- [INTERPRETER]
- with wrong

00:16:47.119 --> 00:16:55.119
- [INTERPRETER]
- and thinks they are doing the best things in the world.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:16:56.339 --> 00:17:01.539
- Everyone thinks they are the chosen ones of God.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:17:02.199 --> 00:17:08.839
Jews thinks they are chosen ones, Muslims thinks they are chosen ones, the Christians think they are chosen ones

00:17:09.739 --> 00:17:16.459
[INTERPRETER]

00:17:17.039 --> 00:17:22.559
- These brands are not going to help anyone.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:17:23.299 --> 00:17:28.179
- In the Bible, in the second verse of second chapter of Mathews,

00:17:28.519 --> 00:17:34.619
Christ has clearly said, "You'll be calling Me, 'Christ, Christ,' I won't recognize you."

00:17:35.459 --> 00:17:41.619
[INTERPRETER]

00:17:42.399 --> 00:17:48.679
What is written between the lines is that, just by calling yourself that you are a follower of

00:17:48.899 --> 00:17:55.759
this one and a follower of that and a follower of that, doesn't give you the right

00:17:57.419 --> 00:18:01.159
to establish yourself as a religious person.

00:18:01.739 --> 00:18:07.399
[INTERPRETER]

00:18:07.599 --> 00:18:12.139
[INTERPRETER]

00:18:14.179 --> 00:18:21.859
- A religious person has a religion within himself
- [INTERPRETER]

00:18:23.299 --> 00:18:31.259
- who has no temptations,
- [INTERPRETER]
- who has no weaknesses,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:18:31.699 --> 00:18:37.739
- who doesn't consider money that important,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:18:38.379 --> 00:18:45.179
- who is love and compassion and generosity,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:18:46.039 --> 00:18:52.059
- who is peace and joy
- [INTERPRETER]
- Such a person

00:18:54.079 --> 00:18:58.719
has the whole personality which is so auspicious.

00:18:59.179 --> 00:19:05.879
- [INTERPRETER]
- Auspiciousness is a coefficience

00:19:07.639 --> 00:19:14.519
- [INTERPRETER]
- which emits the rays of Divinity all around

00:19:15.179 --> 00:19:22.119
- [INTERPRETER]
- and such a person wherever he goes or wherever he moves,

00:19:22.359 --> 00:19:29.699
- he spreads auspiciousness.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:19:30.839 --> 00:19:34.579
- Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

00:19:34.839 --> 00:19:39.279
- [INTERPRETER]

00:19:39.939 --> 00:19:47.439
- How many Christians we'll find who don't have adulterous eyes?
- [INTERPRETER]

00:19:47.759 --> 00:19:52.959
- It's a very subtle thing Christ has said.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:19:54.459 --> 00:19:59.019
The eyes of a rich person has to be innocent,

00:19:59.579 --> 00:20:04.939
- [INTERPRETER]
- devoid of lust and greed.

00:20:05.599 --> 00:20:08.599
- [INTERPRETER]

00:20:09.919 --> 00:20:17.539
- He doesn't profess any religion whatsoever but He's religious
- [INTERPRETER]

00:20:17.979 --> 00:20:24.959
and the eyes are so innocent that when such a person even looks at someone,

00:20:25.359 --> 00:20:29.559
[INTERPRETER]

00:20:30.159 --> 00:20:37.559
- he can bestow benevolence of that person.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:20:39.139 --> 00:20:45.819
This should happen then we can say that there is a person who has religion

00:20:46.239 --> 00:20:51.019
built in his Central Nervous System - in his whole being.

00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:58.339
[INTERPRETER]

00:20:59.519 --> 00:21:05.879
- But everybody can be in religion.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:21:06.619 --> 00:21:13.799
Everybody can get to that state where he can

00:21:14.859 --> 00:21:18.719
judge on an Absolute level.

00:21:19.399 --> 00:21:24.979
[INTERPRETER]

00:21:25.359 --> 00:21:30.019
- We live in the world of relativity
- [INTERPRETER]

00:21:30.419 --> 00:21:37.419
- but then we start living in the world of Absolute.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:21:37.679 --> 00:21:44.819
Now somebody looks a very good person, he knows how to play flute, maybe or he's trying to be

00:21:45.139 --> 00:21:52.819
- very nice and good outwardly, he can make gestures like a saint - how are you to make out?

00:21:53.459 --> 00:21:59.659
[INTERPRETER]

00:21:59.879 --> 00:22:02.959
[INTERPRETER]

00:22:03.319 --> 00:22:09.859
- There's a way.
- [INTERPRETER]
- When you're enlightened, then from your hands

00:22:11.939 --> 00:22:15.039
- the vibrations of cool breeze flow.

00:22:16.179 --> 00:22:21.419
[INTERPRETER]

00:22:21.879 --> 00:22:29.859
- You can feel on these finger-tips
- [INTERPRETER]
- the centers.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:22:31.279 --> 00:22:37.419
- of another person
- [INTERPRETER]
- and if,

00:22:38.779 --> 00:22:43.519
- supposing somebody has cancer
- [INTERPRETER]

00:22:43.859 --> 00:22:50.359
- you can feel that person on your finger-tips.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:22:50.819 --> 00:22:57.479
If you know how just to put the centers alright, you cure the person.

00:22:57.879 --> 00:23:02.359
- [INTERPRETER]

00:23:02.899 --> 00:23:09.639
- So you jump into a new awareness
- [INTERPRETER]

00:23:09.939 --> 00:23:15.019
- higher than the human awareness - much higher -
- [INTERPRETER]

00:23:15.259 --> 00:23:22.659
- of collective consciousness.
- [INTERPRETER]
- That you can feel others

00:23:23.479 --> 00:23:29.279
- [INTERPRETER]
- and you can feel yourself.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:23:30.039 --> 00:23:36.599
- But there are people who are still very limited and stupid.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:23:37.439 --> 00:23:44.179
They identify themselves with some sort of an idea and get stuck with it

00:23:45.079 --> 00:23:49.439
- [INTERPRETER]

00:23:52.439 --> 00:23:57.759
- but if you are an open-minded person,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:23:58.199 --> 00:24:05.179
- I have to tell you the good news
- [INTERPRETER]
- that all such people

00:24:05.579 --> 00:24:12.219
- [INTERPRETER]
- can become enlightened.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:24:13.539 --> 00:24:20.279
- You have to have purity of intelligence.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:24:20.619 --> 00:24:25.119
It's not brilliance that dazzles others or gives big lectures and all that

00:24:25.419 --> 00:24:29.599
[INTERPRETER]

00:24:30.219 --> 00:24:35.579
but pure intelligence means that sees directly the Truth

00:24:36.099 --> 00:24:41.679
- [INTERPRETER]
- which is not

00:24:42.779 --> 00:24:46.919
maligned or spoiled by ideologies

00:24:48.059 --> 00:24:53.839
- [INTERPRETER]
- and theories.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:24:54.619 --> 00:25:00.819
- The intelligence which is so loud
- [INTERPRETER]

00:25:01.259 --> 00:25:06.339
- or is a slave
- [INTERPRETER]
- of other's domination
- [INTERPRETER]

00:25:06.559 --> 00:25:12.879
- cannot be pure intelligence.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:25:14.439 --> 00:25:17.639
But today, as people are getting disillusioned

00:25:19.179 --> 00:25:24.459
- [INTERPRETER]
- many honest and sincere people

00:25:25.199 --> 00:25:30.019
- [INTERPRETER]
- are there, seeking the Truth.

00:25:30.399 --> 00:25:34.339
- [INTERPRETER]
- And if you're honest

00:25:35.939 --> 00:25:39.639
in your seeking, you will have to have it.

00:25:40.359 --> 00:25:47.339
- [INTERPRETER]
- That is your right
- [INTERPRETER]

00:25:48.119 --> 00:25:53.639
- that you have to get.
- [INTERPRETER]
- Then you'll be surprised

00:25:53.999 --> 00:25:57.459
that you'll transcend all limitations of the world.

00:25:57.899 --> 00:26:03.819
[INTERPRETER]

00:26:04.779 --> 00:26:12.459
- You won't have all these ideas which make you small;
- [INTERPRETER]

00:26:12.959 --> 00:26:17.759
- Like a drop becomes the ocean,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:26:17.959 --> 00:26:22.059
that's how your personality becomes very great.

00:26:23.019 --> 00:26:26.359
- [INTERPRETER]

00:26:27.279 --> 00:26:33.899
I'm very fortunate that I'm born at a time when this special work has to be done.

00:26:34.359 --> 00:26:39.619
- [INTERPRETER]

00:26:39.959 --> 00:26:45.999
Is mentioned in one of our old texts that, at the time when there will be

00:26:46.279 --> 00:26:49.879
ghor Kaliyuga - means the worst time in the modern times -

00:26:50.279 --> 00:26:55.019
- [INTERPRETER]

00:26:55.459 --> 00:27:03.139
- those people who are seeking the Truth
- [INTERPRETER]
- in the jungles
- [INTERPRETER]

00:27:03.619 --> 00:27:07.759
- and in the Himalayas,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:27:08.099 --> 00:27:16.059
- will find the Truth - their Kundalini will be awakened.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:27:16.619 --> 00:27:21.019
- And today that time has come.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:27:22.279 --> 00:27:27.779
You have been already explained about this - the knowledge of

00:27:29.439 --> 00:27:37.279
- the roots, the Spirit.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:27:37.979 --> 00:27:42.939
The Spirit is the Truth.

00:27:44.819 --> 00:27:52.459
- [INTERPRETER]
- Truth is the love -
- [INTERPRETER]
- the pure love,

00:27:53.099 --> 00:28:00.779
- [INTERPRETER]
- the All-Pervading love
- [INTERPRETER]
- and that you know through your Central Nervous System -

00:28:01.319 --> 00:28:09.119
- [INTERPRETER]
- not just by reading something
- [INTERPRETER]

00:28:09.859 --> 00:28:17.539
- but as you see the flowers,
- [INTERPRETER]
- in the same way you know the Truth.

00:28:18.039 --> 00:28:24.099
- [INTERPRETER]
- The another thing is,

00:28:24.979 --> 00:28:30.779
in the Nature of Spirit, it is the attention.

00:28:31.859 --> 00:28:39.799
- [INTERPRETER]
- That means the, when the Spirit enters into our attention,

00:28:40.519 --> 00:28:48.359
- [INTERPRETER]
- our attention becomes enlightened.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:28:48.899 --> 00:28:54.679
Sitting down here we can find out about anyone in the whole world.

00:30:26.478 --> 00:30:33.698
- [INTERPRETER]
- She's asking, "Why getting human-beings [UNCLEAR] does it [UNCLEAR] their significance?"

00:30:33.878 --> 00:30:36.898
- the meaning why they get it?

00:30:36.898 --> 00:30:42.458
I was about to tell you today but he told Me that he's already talked about it, so I'll just now tell you.

00:30:43.298 --> 00:30:49.798
[INTERPRETER]

00:30:50.038 --> 00:30:55.178
- [INTERPRETER]
- but I'll tell you in short.

00:30:56.998 --> 00:31:01.238
- Now here you see - just push forward everybody cannot see -

00:31:01.578 --> 00:31:05.198
- [UNCLEAR]
- [INTERPRETER]

00:31:05.898 --> 00:31:13.358
- What's she saying?
- She was asking, why the question is not answered - it will just start
- Annh?

00:31:13.578 --> 00:31:17.398
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:19.338 --> 00:31:26.018
- Now, this is what you are inside - let's see.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:31:26.398 --> 00:31:34.458
Now, on the left-hand side you see a blue line which is, what we call, is the

00:31:34.658 --> 00:31:40.038
Moon channel or you can say the Left Sympathetic Nervous System.This channel gives

00:31:40.278 --> 00:31:47.618
- energy to the Left Sympathetic Nervous System.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:31:47.838 --> 00:31:55.098
- [INTERPRETER]
- and the another one is the right side one, which is

00:31:55.318 --> 00:32:00.838
- yellow colored, goes up there and like a bile color it is,

00:32:01.678 --> 00:32:09.438
- [INTERPRETER]
- is called as the

00:32:09.718 --> 00:32:17.038
- Sun line or Surya Naadi, which gives rise to the Right Sympathetic System.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:32:18.118 --> 00:32:22.778
Now, the central one is the one what we call as the

00:32:23.298 --> 00:32:30.758
Sushumna - is the central path of ascent - which is actually gives, gives,

00:32:31.058 --> 00:32:35.278
I mean, nourishes the Para-sympathetic Nervous system.

00:32:35.838 --> 00:32:43.898
[INTERPRETER]

00:32:44.758 --> 00:32:49.818
Now, in a human-being, out of his freedom

00:32:50.718 --> 00:32:55.018
he can either go to any extreme of left or right.

00:32:55.458 --> 00:32:58.858
[INTERPRETER]

00:32:59.158 --> 00:33:03.218
[INTERPRETER]

00:33:03.458 --> 00:33:10.278
Supposing, he is over-active and futuristic and thinks too much and works too much

00:33:10.738 --> 00:33:17.938
and physically, all the time, working out like jogging, this, that, all sorts of things,

00:33:18.198 --> 00:33:25.298
[INTERPRETER]

00:33:25.558 --> 00:33:31.398
- then he goes to the right side too much
- [INTERPRETER]
- because he's futuristic,

00:33:31.738 --> 00:33:38.378
- [INTERPRETER]
- his feeling
- [INTERPRETER]

00:33:38.638 --> 00:33:46.638
- or he may be successful
- [INTERPRETER]
- and but he develops a tremendous thing called ego.

00:33:47.298 --> 00:33:53.798
- [INTERPRETER]
- Ego is there that, 'I'm doing this and I'm doing that.'

00:33:54.058 --> 00:34:00.518
- [INTERPRETER]
- Actually, we're doing nothing.

00:34:01.118 --> 00:34:06.578
- [INTERPRETER]
- Whatever is dead we convert it;

00:34:07.058 --> 00:34:11.198
Say the wood is dead, we make the roof - we think we make something great.

00:34:12.258 --> 00:34:17.298
[INTERPRETER]

00:34:17.518 --> 00:34:20.998
[INTERPRETER]

00:34:21.378 --> 00:34:26.358
- From dead to another dead
- [INTERPRETER]

00:34:26.638 --> 00:34:31.598
- or from whatever is dead matter, we try to discover something out of that
- [INTERPRETER]

00:34:31.978 --> 00:34:38.638
- and you use the energy of that
- [INTERPRETER]

00:34:39.478 --> 00:34:45.238
but we cannot even create one little atom.

00:34:46.078 --> 00:34:49.698
[INTERPRETER]

00:34:51.098 --> 00:34:57.798
- This is the situation
- [INTERPRETER]
- but we think we're doing this, we're doing that.

00:34:58.218 --> 00:35:05.878
- [INTERPRETER]
- As we give stories of some Indian villagers going by plane -

00:35:06.258 --> 00:35:12.918
- were told not to take too much luggage
- [INTERPRETER]

00:35:13.138 --> 00:35:17.998
- [INTERPRETER]
- because the plane will feel heavy

00:35:18.478 --> 00:35:25.078
- [INTERPRETER]
- so they took all the luggage in the plane but put it on their heads.

00:35:25.598 --> 00:35:29.598
[LAUGHTER] [INTERPRETER]

00:35:30.238 --> 00:35:35.378
They were asked, "Why do you do?" They said, "We're trying to reduce the weight of the plane."

00:35:35.838 --> 00:35:41.638
[INTERPRETER]

00:35:41.958 --> 00:35:47.698
- In the same way, we have our ego, we think that way.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:35:48.718 --> 00:35:55.158
Now this over-activity on the right hand side - ego - harms others -

00:35:56.178 --> 00:36:03.618
- [INTERPRETER]
- doesn't harm you
- [INTERPRETER]

00:36:03.898 --> 00:36:11.478
- but physically can give you tremendous effects.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:36:12.038 --> 00:36:17.658
First of all, as you see, it starts with that yellow second center, called as Swadhishthana,

00:36:18.058 --> 00:36:25.718
- [INTERPRETER]
- which is responsible, which is very much responsible

00:36:25.958 --> 00:36:32.618
- for all kinds of physical and mental activities;
- [INTERPRETER]

00:36:32.858 --> 00:36:39.558
In the sense that it converts the fat cells of the stomach for the use of the brain

00:36:40.158 --> 00:36:44.478
[INTERPRETER]

00:36:44.878 --> 00:36:48.878
to replace the grey - there are cells - when we think too much.

00:36:49.298 --> 00:36:52.738
[INTERPRETER]

00:36:53.098 --> 00:36:59.518
So when we think too much, this poor chakra cannot look after other functions.

00:36:59.938 --> 00:37:06.818
[INTERPRETER]

00:37:07.058 --> 00:37:13.758
Another important work it has got, the liver, the pancreas, the spleen,

00:37:14.218 --> 00:37:18.038
the kidney and with your intestines,

00:37:18.518 --> 00:37:24.098
[INTERPRETER]

00:37:24.338 --> 00:37:32.298
- [INTERPRETER]
- the large intestine, the descending colon of the large intestine, they say.

00:37:32.498 --> 00:37:35.538
[INTERPRETER]

00:37:35.838 --> 00:37:42.098
Now, when these things are neglected, the first thing you get is tremendous heat in the body.

00:37:42.798 --> 00:37:48.838
- [INTERPRETER]
- Tremendous heat

00:37:49.258 --> 00:37:53.858
because the liver is over-active

00:37:54.458 --> 00:38:00.838
- [INTERPRETER]
- Then we see heat passes

00:38:01.178 --> 00:38:06.738
to higher side and one gets uh.. asthma

00:38:07.138 --> 00:38:12.498
- [INTERPRETER]
- because it melts the phlegm

00:38:14.498 --> 00:38:19.358
- It melts the phlegm, phlegm. Doctor, what do you say to the phlegm?

00:38:19.738 --> 00:38:26.458
- Can't get, ment?
- [INTERPRETER]

00:38:27.018 --> 00:38:32.898
As a result of that, you get hay fever, you get sneezing,

00:38:33.138 --> 00:38:39.458
- you get running nose and you get asthma.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:38:39.698 --> 00:38:46.738
- [INTERPRETER]
- Of course, in the medicine, they don't say this.

00:38:47.358 --> 00:38:53.258
- [INTERPRETER]
- They only treat the symptoms - I'm telling you the root cause.

00:38:53.978 --> 00:38:57.398
[INTERPRETER]

00:38:57.998 --> 00:39:02.978
Now, then on the other side, is the - you have got the pancreas.

00:39:03.418 --> 00:39:08.938
- [INTERPRETER]
- The pancreas becomes over-active

00:39:09.258 --> 00:39:15.518
- [INTERPRETER]
- so you develop diabetes.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:39:16.578 --> 00:39:22.118
You'll be amazed, that in India, in a village, people take so much sugar

00:39:22.498 --> 00:39:26.058
that they say, that the spoon must stand in the sugar.

00:39:26.338 --> 00:39:32.378
[INTERPRETER]

00:39:32.618 --> 00:39:37.978
- Nobody gets diabetes
- [INTERPRETER]
- but if you think too much

00:39:38.938 --> 00:39:44.298
all the energy is spent in thinking - you get diabetes; Specially

00:39:44.538 --> 00:39:47.618
people who sit down and plan, plan, plan.

00:39:48.038 --> 00:39:54.958
[INTERPRETER]

00:39:55.258 --> 00:39:59.678
Then you have the third problem, which is more serious,

00:40:00.338 --> 00:40:03.878
- [INTERPRETER]
- is the spleen

00:40:05.398 --> 00:40:10.278
which is like a speedometer, which keeps the rhythm of life with us.

00:40:12.878 --> 00:40:19.578
- Speedome...
- [INTERPRETER]

00:40:19.918 --> 00:40:27.878
- [INTERPRETER]
- Now, the way we, our life is, what the life is - we invite shocks.

00:40:29.138 --> 00:40:36.458
- [INTERPRETER]
- Early in the morning, we see the newspaper.

00:40:36.758 --> 00:40:42.838
- [INTERPRETER]
- Finished. Horrible news, horrible things.

00:40:43.158 --> 00:40:50.938
- This one fighting, that one killing that - all horrible things.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:40:51.438 --> 00:40:56.358
This poor spleen has to produce more Red blood corpuscles

00:40:56.978 --> 00:41:04.958
- [INTERPRETER]
- for emergency.
- [INTERPRETER]
- So under shock it starts producing more RBC's

00:41:05.438 --> 00:41:13.238
- [INTERPRETER]
- Then you eat your food in a hurry, your breakfast you push it in the mouth, somehow

00:41:13.478 --> 00:41:18.558
- [INTERPRETER]
- because all the time you wasted in newspaper reading

00:41:19.078 --> 00:41:23.898
- [INTERPRETER]
- so you have no time to have your breakfast.

00:41:24.198 --> 00:41:31.018
- [INTERPRETER]
- You get into the car and then you find a jam - finished.

00:41:31.838 --> 00:41:37.938
- [INTERPRETER]
- Then you're breaking your head with worrying.

00:41:38.358 --> 00:41:44.438
- [INTERPRETER]
- Again another shock to poor spleen.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:41:44.638 --> 00:41:52.098
It goes on producing RBC's without any rhythm in it - it becomes hectic.

00:41:52.398 --> 00:41:57.658
- [INTERPRETER]
- It is such a hectic life you lead

00:41:58.138 --> 00:42:05.798
- [INTERPRETER]
- Formerly, in the times of My father, I remember, My father used to come

00:42:06.758 --> 00:42:13.338
for, get up very early, go for his film and have his breakfast on the table

00:42:13.598 --> 00:42:18.318
and My mother would be fanning him and he would eat with that rhythm.

00:42:19.538 --> 00:42:26.518
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:27.138 --> 00:42:30.658
My mother used to give him that rhythm - I used to feel.

00:42:31.438 --> 00:42:37.038
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:37.398 --> 00:42:43.178
- [INTERPRETER]
- but nowadays you're so very hectic,

00:42:44.158 --> 00:42:49.958
- [INTERPRETER]
- slaves of our watch,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:42:50.558 --> 00:42:56.378
- every time trying to reach in time.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:42:56.998 --> 00:43:02.278
I've known people, if you just tell them that, "I have to go to the airport," they go crazy.

00:43:02.558 --> 00:43:10.138
- [INTERPRETER]
- "I have to go not you," but still they're crazy.

00:43:10.558 --> 00:43:14.378
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:14.778 --> 00:43:19.938
And they'll go on telling, "Now time go." "I am going but why are you worried, I am going you are not going."

00:43:20.318 --> 00:43:27.818
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:28.598 --> 00:43:34.218
This kind of behaviour spoils the rhythm of our being.

00:43:35.098 --> 00:43:39.618
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:41.478 --> 00:43:47.998
Then is the big problem; The vulnerability is established

00:43:48.398 --> 00:43:52.578
in the spleen and you get blood cancer.

00:43:53.418 --> 00:44:00.818
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:01.038 --> 00:44:05.238
But the cancer is pathological - it comes from the left side;

00:44:05.758 --> 00:44:09.518
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:09.798 --> 00:44:16.578
In the sense, it is triggered by the left side by some proteins.

00:44:16.918 --> 00:44:20.278
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:21.798 --> 00:44:29.798
- But the vulnerability can come from the right side or from the left side.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:44:31.058 --> 00:44:35.898
Now, if you go too much to the left also, there are problems like that.

00:44:36.618 --> 00:44:43.018
- [INTERPRETER]
- I must have given, at least, hundred lectures on this.

00:44:43.518 --> 00:44:46.558
You can get My tapes and find for yourself

00:44:47.338 --> 00:44:52.958
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:53.318 --> 00:44:56.338
- in all details.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:44:56.878 --> 00:45:02.898
But in this short time, I think, I have already told you not to have a futuristic mind.

00:45:03.478 --> 00:45:09.338
[INTERPRETER]

00:45:09.578 --> 00:45:13.418
- Try to be in the present.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:45:14.098 --> 00:45:19.318
Not only it is happening in our everyday life

00:45:19.778 --> 00:45:22.798
but also in religious life I've seen it happens.

00:45:23.338 --> 00:45:28.738
[INTERPRETER]

00:45:28.958 --> 00:45:35.398
When Shri Rama came on this earth, they said, "We believe only in Parshurama," because he's dead now - finished.

00:45:35.658 --> 00:45:40.318
- If he's dead, it's better to believe a person who's dead.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:45:40.658 --> 00:45:44.158
[INTERPRETER]

00:45:44.558 --> 00:45:50.918
Then Shri Krishna came, they said, "We don't believe in you. We believe in Shri Rama," because He's dead.

00:45:51.118 --> 00:45:58.538
[INTERPRETER]

00:45:58.758 --> 00:46:04.238
- They never want to believe in something that is living today
- [INTERPRETER]

00:46:04.598 --> 00:46:12.318
- from where you can gain.
- [INTERPRETER]
- They want to believe in something that is dead and finished

00:46:12.878 --> 00:46:18.698
- [INTERPRETER]
- because you can keep such a person in the pocket.

00:46:19.478 --> 00:46:24.178
- [INTERPRETER]
- Nobody is going to ask you.

00:46:24.518 --> 00:46:28.598
If Christ is not living, He's not going to say, "Why did you do this wrong?"

00:46:29.058 --> 00:46:33.058
[INTERPRETER]

00:46:33.378 --> 00:46:37.918
So, people don't want to take anything in the present but present is the Truth.

00:46:38.438 --> 00:46:43.478
[INTERPRETER]

00:46:43.818 --> 00:46:49.758
The past is finished and the future doesn't exist, so why not get it in the present moment.

00:46:50.218 --> 00:46:55.858
[INTERPRETER]

00:46:56.178 --> 00:47:02.598
Because we cannot live in the present moment with the temperant life, we get into troubles -

00:47:02.838 --> 00:47:10.238
physical, mental, emotional, uh.. material, economic, political - all kinds.

00:47:10.798 --> 00:47:18.378
[INTERPRETER]

00:47:20.978 --> 00:47:27.698
- So, how to come to the center?
- [INTERPRETER]
- The Kundalini

00:47:29.238 --> 00:47:35.898
goes through your centers and brings you in one line.

00:47:36.878 --> 00:47:42.298
- [INTERPRETER]

00:47:42.738 --> 00:47:48.538
- She integrates you
- [INTERPRETER]
- but this knowledge is difficult to digest.

00:47:49.438 --> 00:47:54.778
- [INTERPRETER]
- One of the reasons is, I'm living.

00:47:55.578 --> 00:48:02.018
- [INTERPRETER]
- When I will be dead, then you might build temples for Me.

00:48:02.558 --> 00:48:09.398
- [INTERPRETER]
- But just now in your time, I'm telling you

00:48:09.958 --> 00:48:15.678
- then you won't accept,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:48:15.858 --> 00:48:21.878
- you won't try to understand and learn.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:48:22.798 --> 00:48:26.358
- This is human nature
- [INTERPRETER]

00:48:27.498 --> 00:48:35.258
and this is the reason why all the people, who came on this earth, could not give realization to anyone of them.

00:48:35.498 --> 00:48:41.558
[INTERPRETER]

00:48:41.798 --> 00:48:47.158
Even the Christ disciples felt the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost when He was dead.

00:48:47.658 --> 00:48:52.858
[INTERPRETER]

00:48:53.098 --> 00:48:57.218
- Till the end they were doubting Him.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:48:57.458 --> 00:49:03.718
- They were doubting His Immaculate conception.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:49:06.238 --> 00:49:11.998
- God is miraculous.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:49:12.338 --> 00:49:19.398
- You have to see those miracles after sahaja yoga.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:49:19.638 --> 00:49:24.718
- One after another - you'll be amazed.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:49:25.498 --> 00:49:31.158
- But one has to rise to that awareness.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:49:33.038 --> 00:49:38.478
Now, one of them I told you one side but the another side is weakened, becomes Schizophrenic man

00:49:39.058 --> 00:49:45.438
[INTERPRETER]

00:49:46.118 --> 00:49:52.078
- and all the pathological problems
- [INTERPRETER]
- come from the left side.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:49:55.018 --> 00:50:02.078
I think, this has taken too much time, this answering so I claim, I cannot answer.

00:50:03.058 --> 00:50:08.438
[INTERPRETER]

00:50:11.398 --> 00:50:19.418
[GERMAN?]

00:50:21.538 --> 00:50:29.458
[GERMAN?]

00:50:29.718 --> 00:50:36.198
[GERMAN?]

00:50:37.058 --> 00:50:43.118
[GERMAN?]

00:50:43.478 --> 00:50:47.058
[GERMAN?]

00:50:47.238 --> 00:50:53.958
- [UNCLEAR]
- Shri Krishna, Shree Mataji is the One.
- [SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:50:54.238 --> 00:51:01.538
You should have written them down and I had said that, if you give Me the questions, I will answer them

00:51:01.758 --> 00:51:09.218
when I have to speak but nobody gave Me any questions - I didn't know what to answer; Yesterday I said so.

00:51:11.218 --> 00:51:15.998
- Now there is not so much time, Sir but let's see what is
- There are three questions.

00:51:16.418 --> 00:51:22.658
[SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS] You tell him that yesterday I had said, that if you have any questions,

00:51:22.878 --> 00:51:29.018
then you write them down and then hand it over to Me and then in My speech, I will answer them.

00:51:29.318 --> 00:51:34.558
Now, you see the time is up and again their Nabhi, their

00:51:34.838 --> 00:51:38.278
spleen will become hectic.

00:51:39.138 --> 00:51:44.198
[INTERPRETER]

00:51:44.458 --> 00:51:47.618
[INTERPRETER]

00:51:47.838 --> 00:51:55.338
Now, I will be very happy if you could write down those questions for Me and I'll answer them; I promise you.

00:51:55.738 --> 00:52:01.318
[INTERPRETER]

00:52:01.538 --> 00:52:05.918
But all the people are now anxious to have their realization.

00:52:06.138 --> 00:52:10.798
[INTERPRETER]

00:52:11.238 --> 00:52:18.778
[GERMAN]

00:52:19.438 --> 00:52:26.938
He's saying Shree Mataji, he's saying that You said, "We have time for questions."

00:52:27.158 --> 00:52:31.238
But up to a point. I cannot go on the whole night, Sir.

00:52:33.238 --> 00:52:40.618
Because they never ask any questions, though there's nothing to fight. There isn't so much time. Please be seated. I'll answer all your questions.

00:52:41.258 --> 00:52:45.458
Please. I told yesterday that you give all your questions.

00:52:45.958 --> 00:52:52.958
You should have given Me all your questions when I arrived but no questions till I said, "Alright, let's have one or two questions."

00:52:53.258 --> 00:52:57.718
Alright? Please be seated. I agree with you, I should have answered but

00:52:58.038 --> 00:53:03.978
you have three questions and I'll answer all of them, so now be satisfied, please be seated - thank you.

00:53:04.818 --> 00:53:11.558
[INTERPRETER]

00:53:11.798 --> 00:53:16.198
- [INTERPRETER]
- You should write it down and give it to Me.

00:53:16.838 --> 00:53:22.438
I promise you, I'll send you a letter of answering your questions.

00:53:23.318 --> 00:53:29.018
[INTERPRETER]

00:53:31.278 --> 00:53:41.438
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:41.658 --> 00:53:49.078
So now, those who want to have their Self-realization, have to

00:53:49.278 --> 00:53:53.378
[AUDIENCE]

00:53:53.718 --> 00:54:01.578
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:03.258 --> 00:54:11.018
Yes, that is what I think but he doesn't understand that, you see. Doesn't matter but we'll try if we can give him Self-realization.

00:54:11.478 --> 00:54:15.318
- If it works out, very good; All his questions will be answered in any case.

00:54:16.058 --> 00:54:22.658
- [INTERPRETER]

00:54:23.558 --> 00:54:31.618
It doesn't happen on mental level, you see, it is something, a living process that takes place within. It's not a mental level thing.

00:54:33.038 --> 00:54:40.418
[INTERPRETER]

00:54:40.638 --> 00:54:48.218
One can, at the most, take you to that part or tell you but you have to have it yourself.

00:54:49.478 --> 00:54:52.618
[INTERPRETER]

00:54:55.358 --> 00:54:59.558
Now, those people who want to have realization

00:55:00.678 --> 00:55:03.878
should sit here otherwise, I cannot force it on you.

00:55:04.658 --> 00:55:10.998
- [INTERPRETER]
- is your sweet will.

00:55:11.778 --> 00:55:15.058
[INTERPRETER]

00:55:15.298 --> 00:55:20.678
It will take about ten minutes or fifteen minutes - is your sweet will -

00:55:21.558 --> 00:55:28.518
- [INTERPRETER]
- and those who do not want to have, should leave the hall.

00:55:29.778 --> 00:55:37.458
[INTERPRETER]

00:55:37.718 --> 00:55:41.458
People don't like others to look at them when they are meditating.

00:55:41.678 --> 00:55:46.058
[INTERPRETER]

00:55:49.338 --> 00:55:56.738
- Now those people, who are standing, can also sit here - there's room here.
- [INTERPRETER]
- There's some room here

00:55:56.958 --> 00:56:01.878
Please be seated. Be comfortable. Please be seated - there's room here.

00:56:16.038 --> 00:56:21.378
- Here, there is some room here.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:57:52.036 --> 00:57:55.556
It's very simple, please. You have to do as we did yesterday.

00:57:56.216 --> 00:58:02.456
But those who got realization yesterday, they will re-establish it properly

00:58:03.456 --> 00:58:08.956
and the ones who haven't got it, will get it today, I hope.

00:58:10.536 --> 00:58:16.156
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:16.476 --> 00:58:22.576
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:22.856 --> 00:58:27.116
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:27.356 --> 00:58:30.556
We also have a workshop for you.

00:58:31.496 --> 00:58:39.076
- [INTERPRETER]
- You're not to give any money to anyone,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:58:39.616 --> 00:58:44.676
- there's no business going on.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:58:44.936 --> 00:58:51.096
- You can go and ask them what you want to ask
- [INTERPRETER]

00:58:52.256 --> 00:58:58.536
- and they will work on you and explain to you.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:58:59.716 --> 00:59:04.676
In such a short time, these Austrians have become so knowledgeable

00:59:05.056 --> 00:59:10.456
[INTERPRETER]

00:59:11.096 --> 00:59:17.876
- in the same way, you all could become very knowledgeable.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:59:18.116 --> 00:59:21.896
And all this knowledge is available to you because it is your own.

00:59:22.356 --> 00:59:27.816
[INTERPRETER]

00:59:28.396 --> 00:59:31.936
And the new revolution of a very peaceful type

00:59:32.696 --> 00:59:37.136
within us, is working out in the whole humanity only.

00:59:37.736 --> 00:59:42.496
[INTERPRETER]

00:59:42.696 --> 00:59:46.256
[INTERPRETER]

00:59:46.896 --> 00:59:51.196
- which will manifest
- [INTERPRETER]
- all over

00:59:51.896 --> 00:59:55.176
- [INTERPRETER]
- and as I told you,

00:59:55.556 --> 01:00:01.036
that the One who has created this world will not allow this world to be destroyed.

01:00:01.376 --> 01:00:07.776
- [INTERPRETER]

01:00:11.276 --> 01:00:17.716
Now, I have to make one humble request, is to take out the shoes, to take the help of the Mother Earth, for a while.

01:00:17.996 --> 01:00:22.916
- [INTERPRETER]

01:00:26.636 --> 01:00:30.196
Apart from that, shoes are different styles, so it's better.

01:00:31.016 --> 01:00:35.256
- [INTERPRETER]

01:00:36.036 --> 01:00:41.656
- Now, put both the feet on the Mother Earth
- [INTERPRETER]

01:00:42.256 --> 01:00:48.376
so the Mother Earth sucks in the left and right side problems within us.

01:00:48.996 --> 01:00:55.376
- [INTERPRETER]

01:00:55.976 --> 01:01:01.456
Automatically she sucks in when we start feeling the All-Pervading [power]

01:01:01.936 --> 01:01:07.596
- [INTERPRETER]

01:01:09.796 --> 01:01:16.316
So, the first thing that happens to you, that when the Kundalini crosses this center

01:01:16.576 --> 01:01:20.096
you become absolutely peaceful, without thoughts.

01:01:20.836 --> 01:01:27.356
- [INTERPRETER]

01:01:27.636 --> 01:01:32.596
- You become thoughtlessly aware.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:01:33.616 --> 01:01:39.096
That means, at this center ego and the superego, the conditioning, is sucked in.

01:01:40.396 --> 01:01:47.036
[INTERPRETER]

01:01:47.276 --> 01:01:52.736
You can think, if you want to but no thoughts can invade you.

01:01:53.096 --> 01:01:59.036
[INTERPRETER]

01:02:00.236 --> 01:02:05.956
Then you feel the cool breeze emitting out of your own head

01:02:06.496 --> 01:02:10.916
[INTERPRETER]

01:02:11.196 --> 01:02:18.116
- which you have to feel yourself.
- [INTERPRETER]
- You have to give yourself a certificate.

01:02:18.736 --> 01:02:22.976
[INTERPRETER]

01:02:23.256 --> 01:02:27.936
- You have to be convinced about yourself.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:02:28.396 --> 01:02:34.596
And then you start feeling the cool breeze, all over, in your hands

01:02:34.796 --> 01:02:38.256
[INTERPRETER]

01:02:39.596 --> 01:02:46.076
but sometimes, this center if it is not alright, you may not feel

01:02:46.456 --> 01:02:54.416
though you may get your realization but you may not feel on your finger-tips, if this center is catching, the nerves are little dead, then you may not feel.

01:02:54.776 --> 01:02:59.516
[INTERPRETER]

01:02:59.856 --> 01:03:05.616
[INTERPRETER]

01:03:05.876 --> 01:03:11.296
- [INTERPRETER]
- But with little practice, you do.

01:03:11.636 --> 01:03:15.836
- [INTERPRETER]

01:03:16.096 --> 01:03:21.896
Practise means, understanding where is the problem is and how to remove the hurdles, you get it.

01:03:22.636 --> 01:03:28.716
- [INTERPRETER]

01:03:30.936 --> 01:03:38.716
Now, as we are going to use our left hand to express our power of desire, like this on your lap

01:03:38.936 --> 01:03:45.516
comfortably you have to sit but little straight - not like this or like that but straight

01:03:46.536 --> 01:03:53.756
- [INTERPRETER]

01:03:54.076 --> 01:03:58.456
- [INTERPRETER]

01:03:58.716 --> 01:04:06.476
and the, and the, if there's anything tight, the waist or in the neck or anything, you can loosen it.

01:04:06.936 --> 01:04:12.556
- [INTERPRETER]

01:04:13.036 --> 01:04:18.596
- In short, you should be comfortable.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:04:19.216 --> 01:04:26.076
The right hand should be used for nourishing or

01:04:26.416 --> 01:04:29.956
helping the Kundalini, by putting on different chakras.

01:04:30.496 --> 01:04:38.476
[INTERPRETER]

01:04:38.696 --> 01:04:42.796
- All of you must do it.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:04:44.276 --> 01:04:47.256
- It's very simple.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:04:48.196 --> 01:04:54.416
Now, I'll show you and then, later on, we can close the eyes and do the meditation.

01:04:55.056 --> 01:05:02.236
[INTERPRETER]

01:05:02.656 --> 01:05:08.756
- First we put the right hand on the heart,
- [INTERPRETER]

01:05:09.096 --> 01:05:12.616
where is the reflection of the Spirit.

01:05:13.296 --> 01:05:17.636
- [INTERPRETER]
- You can put it under the coat.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:05:18.876 --> 01:05:25.416
- [INTERPRETER]
- It's very good; So many people have heart troubles and things -

01:05:25.796 --> 01:05:30.176
is a very good thing to put your right hand on your heart.

01:05:30.396 --> 01:05:34.976
[INTERPRETER]

01:05:37.356 --> 01:05:41.196
Now, second

01:05:42.396 --> 01:05:49.016
center we have to attend to, is in the upper part of the abdomen, on the left hand side.

01:05:49.556 --> 01:05:52.756
[INTERPRETER]

01:05:55.216 --> 01:06:00.416
- upper part of the abdomen on the left hand side.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:06:02.036 --> 01:06:08.556
- This gentleman doesn't want to do it so let him go away.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:06:10.016 --> 01:06:14.976
Please. You're already looking not well, why don't you do it?

01:06:16.056 --> 01:06:19.656
[INTERPRETER]

01:06:20.816 --> 01:06:26.696
- [AUDIENCE]
- He says it's his freedom
- Annh?
- It's his freedom not to do it.

01:06:26.896 --> 01:06:34.476
- Annh?
- It's his freedom - doesn't want to do
- Yes, but here others have the freedom that they don't want you to see them;

01:06:35.056 --> 01:06:42.076
- Let them have the freedom.
- [INTERPRETER]
- You should respect their freedom now.

01:06:42.276 --> 01:06:45.676
- [INTERPRETER]
- Who likes others to watch them?

01:06:46.136 --> 01:06:51.636
[INTERPRETER]

01:06:51.896 --> 01:06:59.076
- [INTERPRETER]
- You have to respect their freedom.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:06:59.696 --> 01:07:04.636
- Alright?
- Alright.

01:07:05.816 --> 01:07:11.096
Thank you. When they close eyes, you'll have to close eyes also.

01:07:15.236 --> 01:07:20.676
- We have no right to disturb other people.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:07:21.936 --> 01:07:26.816
They have come for their Self-realization and they have their right to have it

01:07:27.376 --> 01:07:33.076
[INTERPRETER]

01:07:33.756 --> 01:07:39.056
- and it would be sinful to disturb them.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:07:39.536 --> 01:07:44.896
- So I would request you not to disturb them.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:07:49.076 --> 01:07:55.016
[AUDIENCE UNCLEAR]

01:07:57.216 --> 01:08:05.096
Now, please put this right hand in the lower part of your abdomen.

01:08:05.656 --> 01:08:10.236
[INTERPRETER]

01:08:14.976 --> 01:08:21.536
This is the center of your Divine work.

01:08:22.636 --> 01:08:28.996
- [INTERPRETER]
- so you have to have in your consciousness

01:08:30.476 --> 01:08:37.656
the knowledge of the technique.

01:08:38.456 --> 01:08:44.196
- [INTERPRETER]

01:08:44.816 --> 01:08:49.276
Like, when I have to hold something, I know what to do with My consciousness

01:08:49.556 --> 01:08:55.276
[INTERPRETER]

01:08:55.476 --> 01:09:00.256
In the same way, you have to have the Pure Knowledge in your consciousness

01:09:00.496 --> 01:09:05.096
[INTERPRETER]

01:09:06.356 --> 01:09:11.836
- and this is the center that works it out.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:09:12.176 --> 01:09:18.576
Then you go back on your stomach, on the left hand side of the abdomen.

01:09:18.836 --> 01:09:24.116
[INTERPRETER]

01:09:25.136 --> 01:09:30.436
- This is the center of your mastery.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:09:31.536 --> 01:09:36.776
- You have to be the master -
- [INTERPRETER]
- master of yourself.

01:09:37.816 --> 01:09:44.116
- [INTERPRETER]
- No slave of any stupidity
- [INTERPRETER]

01:09:44.596 --> 01:09:50.156
or of any habit or any kind of temptation

01:09:51.076 --> 01:09:57.456
[INTERPRETER]

01:09:57.676 --> 01:10:04.436
- and you have to be the master of the knowledge.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:10:04.836 --> 01:10:11.196
- So this is a very important center within us.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:10:12.256 --> 01:10:20.276
- Now, put this hand back on to your heart
- [INTERPRETER]

01:10:20.476 --> 01:10:24.336
- where resides the Spirit.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:10:25.396 --> 01:10:32.876
Now, this center is very important, about which I was told, you have been informed - is the center, what we call, the Left Vishuddhi,

01:10:33.156 --> 01:10:39.536
on the left hand side, here - between the neck and this shoulder - in this corner.

01:10:39.916 --> 01:10:47.536
To push the hand that side and turn your head to your right and push your hand, as much as you can, on the back side.

01:10:48.336 --> 01:10:53.936
[INTERPRETER]

01:10:54.216 --> 01:11:00.136
[INTERPRETER]

01:11:00.496 --> 01:11:06.356
Now, this center is caught up when you have a guilt or you think, "I'm guilty."

01:11:07.276 --> 01:11:11.116
[INTERPRETER]

01:11:11.476 --> 01:11:15.696
- Nobody has to feel guilty at all,
- [INTERPRETER]

01:11:16.056 --> 01:11:19.836
- nobody has to feel diffident also.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:11:21.236 --> 01:11:26.876
This catch gives you diseases like angina, also spondylitis.

01:11:29.236 --> 01:11:33.516
This catch gives you diseases like angina and spondylitis.

01:11:36.156 --> 01:11:39.756
[INTERPRETER]

01:11:40.556 --> 01:11:48.296
So it's better that you put your hands here, clearly you put your head this side when we do our meditation later on, when I tell you.

01:11:48.936 --> 01:11:54.476
[INTERPRETER]

01:11:54.696 --> 01:11:57.736
Now, please you have to put your hand on your forehead.

01:11:58.336 --> 01:12:04.236
- [INTERPRETER]
- Right hand, right hand
- [INTERPRETER]
- Left hand is towards Me

01:12:04.456 --> 01:12:11.056
- [INTERPRETER]
- Right hand - now press it on both the sides
- [INTERPRETER]

01:12:11.296 --> 01:12:16.196
- and press it hard
- [INTERPRETER]
- Now

01:12:18.196 --> 01:12:24.336
you have to put your hand on the back side of your head and put the load of your head slowly on to it.

01:12:24.676 --> 01:12:32.616
[INTERPRETER]

01:12:33.296 --> 01:12:39.976
- Lastly, you have to stretch your hand.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:12:40.596 --> 01:12:48.536
Stretch your hand and you will have to put your center of your hand on top of your head

01:12:48.896 --> 01:12:55.016
in the fontanel bone area, where it was a soft bone, for your final baptism.

01:12:55.476 --> 01:13:02.636
[INTERPRETER]

01:13:03.456 --> 01:13:10.696
This was a soft bone in your childhood and you stretch your fingers up and press the thing down.

01:13:10.936 --> 01:13:16.436
- Slowly move your scalp, seven times,
- [INTERPRETER]
- clockwise

01:13:16.716 --> 01:13:21.696
[INTERPRETER]

01:13:21.916 --> 01:13:29.236
- [INTERPRETER]
- slowly.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:16:39.921 --> 01:16:44.881
- That's all.
- [INTERPRETER]
- This is time when we have to look to ourselves, not to others.

01:16:45.661 --> 01:16:50.241
[INTERPRETER]

01:16:50.461 --> 01:16:55.101
[INTERPRETER]

01:16:55.481 --> 01:16:59.181
At least keep your eyes shut because the attention has to go inside.

01:16:59.881 --> 01:17:04.981
[INTERPRETER]

01:17:05.321 --> 01:17:10.132
- Till I tell you, please don't open your eyes.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:17:10.592 --> 01:17:16.392
- You have to gain something - nothing has to be gained by Me
- [INTERPRETER]

01:17:16.772 --> 01:17:24.332
- so, be kind to yourself.
- [INTERPRETER]
- It's for your benevolence.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:17:25.592 --> 01:17:31.272
Alright. So, if you put your left hand towards Me

01:17:32.412 --> 01:17:39.692
- [INTERPRETER]
- and both the feet on the ground, straight
- [INTERPRETER]
- and sit little straight

01:17:40.532 --> 01:17:46.032
- [INTERPRETER]
- and close your eyes.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:17:47.412 --> 01:17:51.512
First thing we do, is to put our right hand on our heart.

01:17:52.052 --> 01:17:56.012
[INTERPRETER]

01:17:59.292 --> 01:18:06.052
Here, is the Spirit so, you please ask Me a very fundamental question -

01:18:07.492 --> 01:18:10.412
you may call Me Shree Mataji or Mother -

01:18:10.992 --> 01:18:16.212
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" Ask this fundamental question three times.

01:18:16.552 --> 01:18:23.292
[INTERPRETER]

01:18:23.592 --> 01:18:28.752
[INTERPRETER]

01:18:46.312 --> 01:18:49.592
[Aside - You may turn it little bit, too much]. Now,

01:18:58.472 --> 01:19:01.492
Please put your right hand

01:19:06.152 --> 01:19:10.052
on the upper part of your abdomen, on the left hand side, please.

01:19:10.232 --> 01:19:16.052
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:23.132 --> 01:19:29.312
- Now here, is a very important center
- [INTERPRETER]

01:19:30.092 --> 01:19:37.132
and you have to ask Me a very fundamental question, which is followed by the first one.

01:19:38.352 --> 01:19:43.812
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:44.532 --> 01:19:49.512
If you are your Spirit, you are your master too

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:53.832
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:54.752 --> 01:19:58.792
so, please ask Me a question

01:19:59.592 --> 01:20:05.372
"Mother, am I my own master," ask this question, three times, please.

01:20:05.752 --> 01:20:11.232
[INTERPRETER]

01:20:39.472 --> 01:20:47.172
Now, please hold your right hand in the lower part of your abdomen,

01:20:47.432 --> 01:20:50.952
on the left hand side - keep the left hand towards Me.

01:20:51.672 --> 01:20:56.892
[INTERPRETER]

01:20:57.192 --> 01:21:01.152
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:02.972 --> 01:21:09.092
- This is the center of pure knowledge
- [INTERPRETER]

01:21:09.512 --> 01:21:15.872
- but I cannot force on you.
- [INTERPRETER]
- In your freedom you have to ask for it

01:21:16.152 --> 01:21:22.232
- [INTERPRETER]
- so, please ask six times,

01:21:23.012 --> 01:21:26.032
"Mother, may I have the pure knowledge?

01:21:26.632 --> 01:21:32.952
- [INTERPRETER]

01:21:33.472 --> 01:21:37.992
Six times because this center has got six petals.

01:21:38.312 --> 01:21:42.152
- [INTERPRETER]

01:21:58.572 --> 01:22:04.712
By asking this question, the Kundalini has started, uh..She is awakened.

01:22:05.332 --> 01:22:09.572
- [INTERPRETER]

01:22:10.772 --> 01:22:17.692
To help Her cross all the centers properly, you put your right hand

01:22:18.652 --> 01:22:22.412
on the left hand side of your stomach, in the upper part

01:22:22.992 --> 01:22:29.632
- [INTERPRETER]

01:22:29.892 --> 01:22:35.592
- [INTERPRETER]
- Here, with full confidence,

01:22:36.432 --> 01:22:41.932
please say ten times, "Mother, I am my own master,

01:22:42.192 --> 01:22:49.592
I am my own guru, I am my guide," say this ten times.

01:22:50.152 --> 01:22:55.252
[INTERPRETER]

01:22:55.452 --> 01:22:58.932
[INTERPRETER]

01:23:30.672 --> 01:23:34.672
Now, raise your hand on your heart

01:23:35.712 --> 01:23:42.772
- [INTERPRETER]
- and here, we have to see the greatest truth

01:23:43.692 --> 01:23:50.172
- [INTERPRETER]
- so now, with full confidence in yourself

01:23:50.692 --> 01:23:56.392
please say, "Mother, I am the Spirit." Please say twelve times.

01:23:57.132 --> 01:24:03.032
[INTERPRETER]

01:24:31.812 --> 01:24:36.992
Now, we have to know that the Divine is the ocean and love,

01:24:37.352 --> 01:24:40.872
ocean of love and Grace

01:24:41.252 --> 01:24:46.552
[INTERPRETER]

01:24:46.792 --> 01:24:51.212
but above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness

01:24:51.892 --> 01:24:56.392
[INTERPRETER]

01:24:56.872 --> 01:25:04.032
and whatever mistakes you commit, is capable of completely neutralizing it.

01:25:04.832 --> 01:25:11.052
[INTERPRETER]

01:25:11.272 --> 01:25:15.912
So, have faith in the power of forgiveness of the Divine.

01:25:16.172 --> 01:25:19.552
[INTERPRETER]

01:25:20.472 --> 01:25:26.812
So, raise your right hand in the corner

01:25:27.552 --> 01:25:33.192
of your shoulder and your neck and place your right hand,

01:25:33.832 --> 01:25:40.252
- head towards the right.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:25:41.372 --> 01:25:48.812
- [INTERPRETER]
- Now here, forgive yourself
- [INTERPRETER]
- and say,

01:25:50.252 --> 01:25:55.312
"Mother, I am not guilty at all," sixteen times.

01:25:55.672 --> 01:26:00.632
[INTERPRETER]

01:26:01.272 --> 01:26:07.372
Now, if you still feel guilty, then better punish yourself by saying 108 times.

01:26:07.772 --> 01:26:15.212
[INTERPRETER]

01:26:15.732 --> 01:26:21.032
- You should be pleasantly placed towards yourself
- [INTERPRETER]

01:26:21.692 --> 01:26:27.192
- because you're entering into the kingdom of God.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:26:28.392 --> 01:26:33.372
So now, say it sixteen times, "I am not at all guilty."

01:26:33.732 --> 01:26:37.232
[INTERPRETER]

01:26:41.332 --> 01:26:46.272
Now, raise your right hand to your forehead, across.

01:26:47.112 --> 01:26:52.492
- [INTERPRETER]
- Put your left hand towards Me.

01:26:52.752 --> 01:26:58.352
- [INTERPRETER]
- Now, press on both the sides.

01:26:58.612 --> 01:27:06.672
- [INTERPRETER]
- On this center you have to say, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

01:27:07.492 --> 01:27:11.632
- [INTERPRETER]

01:27:12.232 --> 01:27:16.972
- Now, some people think, it's difficult
- [INTERPRETER]

01:27:17.252 --> 01:27:22.872
- but it is a myth, whether you forgive or don't forgive
- [INTERPRETER]

01:27:23.472 --> 01:27:27.912
but if you do not forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

01:27:28.552 --> 01:27:32.952
[INTERPRETER]

01:27:33.192 --> 01:27:36.692
- So, from your heart you have to say, not how many times,

01:27:37.212 --> 01:27:41.192
[INTERPRETER]

01:27:42.532 --> 01:27:46.152
- "I forgive everyone."
- [INTERPRETER]

01:27:46.672 --> 01:27:52.572
- Now, take your hand on your back side
- [INTERPRETER]

01:27:53.052 --> 01:27:59.432
and put your head on that and put the load of your head, slowly,

01:28:00.132 --> 01:28:04.232
[INTERPRETER]

01:28:04.812 --> 01:28:11.372
Here, for your own satisfaction, you have to say, "O Divine,

01:28:11.772 --> 01:28:19.532
if I've done any mistakes, please forgive me," but only for your satisfaction, not to feel guilty or counting your mistakes.

01:28:20.192 --> 01:28:28.172
[INTERPRETER]

01:28:31.552 --> 01:28:37.772
- Now, please stretch your hand, right hand
- [INTERPRETER]

01:28:38.212 --> 01:28:46.052
- left hand towards Me
- [INTERPRETER]
- and both the feet on the Mother Earth.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:28:46.312 --> 01:28:51.432
Now, put the center of your palm on the fontanel bone area.

01:28:51.852 --> 01:28:56.812
[INTERPRETER]

01:28:57.052 --> 01:29:05.012
- Now, press it hard
- [INTERPRETER]
- and you have to move it seven times, slowly, clockwise,

01:29:06.012 --> 01:29:12.512
- [INTERPRETER]
- Here also I cannot force you

01:29:12.752 --> 01:29:19.152
so you have to say seven times, "Mother, please give me my realization."

01:29:19.692 --> 01:29:26.712
[INTERPRETER]

01:29:27.072 --> 01:29:34.772
- If you like, you can bend your head a little - it will make it easier
- [INTERPRETER]

01:29:35.072 --> 01:29:41.652
- [INTERPRETER]
- Now, press it hard,
- [INTERPRETER]
- stretch your fingers

01:34:46.681 --> 01:34:54.081
a workshop - please, please, please all of you should go

- [INTERPRETER]
- that's the important part
- [INTERPRETER]

01:35:27.641 --> 01:35:33.241
otherwise, next year you'll come and tell Me that, "Mother, I've got cancer, I've got this, I've got that."
