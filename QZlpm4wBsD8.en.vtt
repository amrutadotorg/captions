00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:30.850
Today, we are going to worship the Maha Lakshmi
which I think is very much worshipped in this

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:40.710
country where they worship Her as Maria and
also there’s a swayambu of Maria, you must

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:48.370
have seen. And also there was an apparition
of Her. First I never believed that it could

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:57.090
be, but then after feeling the vibrations,
now I know it was true, that She did appear

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:10.730
here in an apparition. She appeared before
Me, also, you must have seen, in a photograph.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:22.750
This is the principle by which you have risen
to this state. The central path of your ascent

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:30.220
is created by Maha Lakshmi power for the Kundalini
to rise.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:37.110
In the temple of Maha Lakshmi in Kholapur
they always sing the song of “Ude, Ude,

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:45.240
Ambe.” So I asked the people there, “Why
do you sing Ambe’s song in Maha Lakshmi’s

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:54.960
temple?” So they said that, “We don’t
know why we do it, but is it wrong?” I said,

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:06.919
“No, because only in the Maha Lakshmi channel
Kundalini can rise and Kundalini is the Umba.”

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:12.970
That’s how, you see, they understood and
they were really amazed that I explained it

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:19.860
very well ’cause from ancient times this
song has been sung there and they never knew

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:30.970
why this song is sung.
Coming to the point of Maha Lakshmi, we have

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:38.840
to understand what does it do, what it’s
help is that this Maha Lakshmi channel or

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:52.690
the Maha Lakshmi’s powers have created within
us a proper balance, a proper route for Kundalini

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:58.000
to rise.
Left and right has been balanced and She is

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:13.030
the one who creates and makes a wider path
for Kundalini to rise. This is the path of

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:20.720
compassion and love.
Through that compassion and love She creates

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:30.060
this path because She knows that if the path
is not wide enough the Kundalini cannot rise.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:37.930
Ultimately, one reaches a state where you
start seeking and when you start seeking,

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:46.060
your Maha Lakshmi principle has been awakened.
That is awakened and sometimes it is very

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:53.120
strong. Then you start seeking in a mad way.
I am sorry to say that many are already lost

00:08:53.120 --> 00:09:02.160
in seeking, but there are so many who have
now come to the right path and to the right

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.240
ascent.
Another thing this Maha Lakshmi principle

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:15.009
does is to allow the Kundalini’s power to
go to different chakras also. To make a way

00:09:15.009 --> 00:09:23.209
to different chakras and corrects all the
chakras. She is a very flexible force, I should

00:09:23.209 --> 00:09:31.079
say, which guides the Kundalini into different
chakras and She understands which chakra needs

00:09:31.079 --> 00:09:37.050
the help of the Kundalini. So you must have
seen that when the Kundalini rises how She

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:45.800
pulsates, where She goes, where She shows
the need is of your awakening.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:57.720
All this works out because She is full of
compassion and love that you should get your

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:02.980
absolute truth.
We have many problems as it is, you know,

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:11.860
in Sahaja Yoga because when people are ascending
they carry on with them some of their past

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:18.119
stones and they cannot climb. They try then
they fall, they try then they fall, then they

00:10:18.119 --> 00:10:26.689
go up again, they fall. But today I’m going
to tell you about what is the state one has

00:10:26.689 --> 00:10:37.379
to achieve. As Shri Krishna has said it in
the “Gita,” describes Sitha Pragya, the

00:10:37.379 --> 00:10:42.059
second chapter, but it’s very difficult
to understand Him, He is not so clear cut

00:10:42.059 --> 00:10:55.239
as your Mother is.
So people don’t understand what He is saying.

00:10:55.239 --> 00:11:01.179
And they ask the question, “How, how do
you reach that state of Sitha Pragya? How

00:11:01.179 --> 00:11:09.839
do you get to that stage?” But Ganeshwara,
when he wrote his “Ganeshwari,” he called

00:11:09.839 --> 00:11:19.749
it as the Sahaja Stithi, means the state of
Sahaj. He didn’t call Sitha Pragya. He called

00:11:19.749 --> 00:11:33.489
it as Sahaja Stithi, meaning the state of
Sahaj. So he describes the Sahaj in a very

00:11:33.489 --> 00:11:37.660
beautiful manner and very subtle. Of course,
Ganeshwara also, very few people understand,

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:47.019
I think.
A person who reaches that state is like a

00:11:47.019 --> 00:11:59.759
mirror and so many faces pass over that mirror,
so many look into that mirror, so many decorate

00:11:59.759 --> 00:12:07.850
in front of the mirror, but mirror is the
same as it is. So the person who is a Sitha

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:18.399
Pragya or the person who is Sahaja is not
bothered about what is facing him, who is

00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:28.850
facing whom, where he is. He stays within
himself. He contains within himself. Like

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:41.360
the sun. If the sun plays with his different
rays, he is not lost. All the rays again return

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:54.920
to him. In the same way, all the senses that
we have, all the senses that are there do

00:12:54.920 --> 00:13:01.759
play around, but for a person who is in a
Sahaja state it doesn’t matter, it makes

00:13:01.759 --> 00:13:07.420
no difference. He’s not involved. He just
plays around. Again, all of them come back

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:15.660
to him. This is a state you all have to achieve.
Then you are really Sahaja Yogis. But I still

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:22.230
find people lost, getting money out of Sahaja
Yoga, some people lost getting out of leaderships,

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:29.079
some are lost in getting jealousies and envies
and all that.

00:13:29.079 --> 00:13:36.369
So that means a lot of work has to be done,
still, within. There is no need to work as

00:13:36.369 --> 00:13:43.569
such if you leave everything. That’s why
I always say meditate, because when you meditate,

00:13:43.569 --> 00:13:51.949
what happens, that all these things that are
pulling you down are finished.

00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:59.839
Gradually they disappear because you become
yourself. You get contained by yourself and

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:04.790
you are never bored. I am never bored. I don’t
know what boring word means, you see. When

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:10.799
it is with you or alone, I never get bored.
What is there to get bored? If you are not

00:14:10.799 --> 00:14:17.879
involved into anything you never get bored.
Another thing is you rise above all these

00:14:17.879 --> 00:14:24.949
things, like greed. Now people who are greedy
are still involved making money here, making

00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:31.230
money there, all that thing. Those people
who are still full of lust are still making,

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:39.739
organizing, some things like that. But in
a Sahaj Stithi you just watch. You are just

00:14:39.739 --> 00:14:47.850
a witness. You are not lost into anything
that is pulling you down.

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:53.829
This state is not difficult to achieve for
you, at all, because you have crossed over

00:14:53.829 --> 00:15:00.279
your mind. Now all these things come to you
through your mind. I’ve already said that

00:15:00.279 --> 00:15:09.279
mind is a myth, which you must accept. Myth
is that this mind gives you ideas. Some people

00:15:09.279 --> 00:15:14.720
think, “Yes Mother, but – yes Mother,
but – .” This “but” is coming from

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:24.220
your brain, from your mind. The brain is reality,
but not the mind. The mind says “but”

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:29.829
and then you start feeling very depressed
sometimes, unhappy, because some people feel

00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:36.119
even bad because they are very good people,
that there are so few Sahaja Yogis.

00:15:36.119 --> 00:15:45.480
Doesn’t matter. Just watch and this watching
state, this witness state is the Sahaja Stithi.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:53.619
In that you become so subtle, you become yourself,
meaning so subtle that nothing can disturb

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:59.859
you, nothing can change you.
Now see the nature as it is. You know there

00:15:59.859 --> 00:16:08.290
are ninety-two elements and ninety-two elements,
none of them can be, say for example, you

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:20.720
cannot make silver into gold. Gold into silver.
The atoms are so arranged that they have certain

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:29.699
valencies and apart from atom, even molecules
are so arranged that they have their own structure.

00:16:29.699 --> 00:16:36.519
You cannot change. If you try to change then
you will create bombs, atomic bomb, this bomb.

00:16:36.519 --> 00:16:42.639
It’s absolutely destructive. It’s only
human beings who can change, who can transform.

00:16:42.639 --> 00:16:49.799
Now look at the blessings that you are a human
being and you can be transformed and you can

00:16:49.799 --> 00:16:58.970
be made into a new element that is the Self.
This is the specialty of human beings. But

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:04.280
if somebody there is a false guru or somebody,
he tries to do something, you’ll explode.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:11.610
I have seen people who have been to false
gurus, they still faint, they still have problems,

00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:18.860
they still get troubled more than people who
have been without them. They are also all

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:27.250
right now, most of them are improved but this
is one thing one should understand, that in

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:34.760
one way when you are analyzing and when you
are breaking an atom or you are breaking a

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:43.559
molecule and trying to transform, it explodes.
It doesn’t work out.

00:17:43.559 --> 00:17:51.070
The other way round is that when you try to
synthesize, then you can form anything in

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:58.680
the nature. Like, this has now been brought
out by synthesizing, this plastic is created

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:02.940
by synthesizing.
Matter can be synthesized and can be brought

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:15.070
together and human beings have to get synthesized
also. They can be synthesized better than

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:24.040
matter because they change, they transform.
Now say example, there is gold. You make gold

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:35.940
into ornaments, make into anything. It remains
all the time, all the time gold. Gold is gold.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:41.850
It is there. It is not that by changing them
into ornaments it changes. Its element is

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:49.660
there. Gold is there. But for human beings
they get transformed. When they are synthesized.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:19:00.160
This is a very big difference between the
matter and the nature and human beings. Matter,

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:09.790
nature, are different absolutely from human
beings. Human beings, once they are transformed,

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:17.770
it’s like a living process. They become
like flowers but still it is not that you

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:25.270
see in the nature. It’s not the same as
you see in the nature because nature doesn’t

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:35.670
have a mind. It doesn’t have a mind. It
just is under the control of the Divine or

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:45.610
nature that it’s working out that way. But
here you are under your own control. Here

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:54.880
you can control yourself. In this synthesis
which is growing inside you what you find,

00:19:54.880 --> 00:20:01.970
that you are completely in control of yourself.
You know what is happening to you.

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:08.900
Now you start seeing yourself separating from
all these things. Some people come and tell

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:16.190
Me, “Mother, see, my ego is very bad, you
just take it out.” He sees his ego, he sees

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:20.700
what is the problem is. Somebody says, “Mother,
my nabhi is very bad, I’m still busy with

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:32.400
the money.” He sees it. First starts the
knowledge about yourself, we call as self-knowledge.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:38.330
But one has to even go beyond self-knowledge.
By that knowledge, what do you do, we have

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:47.490
to see?
When you have the knowledge, first we say

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:52.050
there’s no knowledge, people have no knowledge,
they are ignorant, there’s darkness, all

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:59.190
that. Now the light has come, you can see.
You can know what’s wrong within you. Now

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:05.770
you start separating yourself from all those
things that you see as wrong with you. You

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:11.110
see them getting out.
So many nonsensical things there are. Like,

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:18.380
we have jealousies, envy, greed and lust.
I mean, it’s horrible things to say on a

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:27.070
Diwali function, see. So the Diwali is that
one by one so many lights are enlightened

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:35.700
and you start seeing it first. First you start
seeing what is wrong with you and then, as

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:45.310
you see it, you don’t want it. Then you
work out to get rid of it, to become clean.

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:55.690
Now this also knowledge disappears. You don’t
have to have any knowledge. You are there.

00:21:55.690 --> 00:22:03.100
You are there. There is no need to know about
your chakras, you are just there. At that

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:13.750
stage nothing matters. You become just like
a stone, I can say. Stone with a brain intact

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:21.900
and a heart intact and a liver intact.
You just don’t mind anything, don’t get

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:32.600
upset with anything. You just enjoy the love
and compassion that’s flowing. And the ripples

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:42.410
that come back to you, even that is lost after
some time and you are just nothing but Sahaj.

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:47.660
That is the state people achieved. In those
days they achieved this state.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:53.040
But with that, what lacking happened, that
they’d get lost. They all got lost. They

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:58.690
couldn’t do anything to others. One person
getting it, becoming great, finished. Or two

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:04.730
persons at the most.
So now Sahaja Yoga stands first of all at

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:12.270
the knowledge state, where you have the knowledge.
First, you should first of all have full knowledge

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:19.030
about yourself. The self-knowledge should
be complete. Then in the third stage we should

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:26.080
say that when the knowledge is full you should
get rid of all those things that you know

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:31.190
about yourself, which are useless, which are
hampering your progress, which you know is

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:34.370
wrong.
Like, I see some dirt falling on my sari,

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:41.390
I’ll just clean it out like that. Then you
start separating yourself into that Sahaja

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:53.710
state. But still in Sahaja Yoga you develop
another dimension which is collective consciousness.

00:23:53.710 --> 00:24:00.180
That is the modern Sahaja Yoga. In the olden
days they didn’t have this, so they just

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:08.480
all got lost. Now you have collective consciousness
and in that collective consciousness you start

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:18.320
feeling others, feeling for others, compassion
for others and you start working out for others.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:22.160
In that also, sometimes, you know, when you
are working around, you think how much money

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:30.340
I can make, what I can achieve as a leader
or some sort of thing is still there.

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:37.110
But this collective consciousness starts growing.
When it starts growing then you become as

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:47.410
I said, drop in the ocean, means complete
ocean. You become complete ocean.

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:53.360
So the ocean has its own mariadas. It doesn’t
bother. It has to live with its mariadas,

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:58.570
it lives with its mariadas. It doesn’t want
to cross any boundaries, all right. Accept

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:05.800
it. It will not cross its boundaries.
In the same way it happens that you are very

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:13.000
self-contained. You are not selfish, but you
become very self-contained. You are contained

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:20.510
within yourself. I know many Sahaja Yogis
are angry that I have not punished many horrible

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:26.150
people who have been troubling Sahaja Yoga.
I don’t have to bother. There’s Paramchaitanya

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:32.470
which is doing a lot of work. Let it look
after it. Why should I bother about anyone?

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:44.640
You see, after all, things are working out
so why to interfere? My job is just to watch,

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:53.930
just to see. That’s sufficient. There’s
no need for Me to kill anybody in this lifetime

00:25:53.930 --> 00:26:01.720
or to destroy. They are destroyed by themselves.
I have told you that I need not expose people,

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:05.190
but whichever country I go, I find people
get exposed.

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:10.940
I run away from there, really, sometimes,
thinking, God knows what more is going to

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:19.080
come. Even little attention on any country,
it just works out. Even without My knowledge,

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:24.130
“Oh My God,” I said, “When did I do
that?”

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:32.760
So one has to become – of course, he becomes
the power of Divine love, no doubt. He becomes

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:39.880
the power of Divine love, but he doesn’t
handle it. Left to this Divine power which

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:47.210
is working, which is also separated from Me,
you’ll be surprised. I am alone. Absolutely

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:55.730
alone. Even this power is separated from Me,
but this power knows what is good for human

00:26:55.730 --> 00:27:01.670
beings, what is good for Sahaja Yoga. It works
on it’s own. I don’t interfere. It’s

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:06.840
a reflex action, believe Me, it’s a reflex
action. Maybe you might say, “Mother, you

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:14.190
have made it.” All right, whatever it is,
but I don’t interfere with it. I don’t

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:18.500
have to tell anything to it. It just works
and it’s working so well.

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:24.290
I’ll give you an example. Once in England
long time back, they said, “Mother, we want

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:27.740
to have a very long summer.” I said, “Why
do you want to ask such things?” “No,

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:31.540
no, Mother, we must have a long summer, a
very long summer, very – ” Three or four

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:40.430
times they said it and it was a very long,
horrible summer in London. And it’s not

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:45.250
like India where we have air conditioning,
fans, something we have, at least hand fans.

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:50.180
There was nothing there. So we didn’t know.
We had a little gallery, we used to sleep

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:59.510
in that. So we went to the shop in England
and we asked in London City, for a fan. So

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:04.550
they said, “All right, after three months.
You order us.” After three months when it

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:09.610
will be very cold they will give us the fan.
We said, “We don’t want any fans.” So

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:15.330
My daughter sent two fans by plane. And that’s
how we managed. You see, Indians, we feel

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:20.830
very hot because we have had a lot of sun
in our country, we feel much hotter than any

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:25.270
one of you. The way you sit in the sun, you
know, we can’t understand. You know, in

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:34.030
India they used to say an Englishman and a
mad dog can only go in the sun. So our situation

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:38.530
is like that, that we cannot go in the sun
because we have had too much.

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:45.320
And this summer, you see, was so tremendous,
so tremendous that after that one thing good

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:52.610
happened. That ochre color appeared on the
leaves and then gradually the red and all

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:59.330
that of the autumn season was best at that
time and then one Sahaja Yogi dreamt that,

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:07.100
“Mother asked me to drive in Her back yard.”
So he told everybody that, “Mother has been

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:12.400
asking me to drive in the back yard.” So
I telephoned to him, I didn’t know he had

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:17.480
dreamt like that, that, “Can you come along
for a while, I want to go and see this autumn

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:24.160
all over England.” So he came and we were
driving, miles together and then they told

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:30.450
Me, “Mother, it was so, he told us that
that was My back yard.” Can you imagine

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:36.690
that he was driving for miles together, beautiful,
just like Canada, the whole England was filled

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:42.320
with the beauty of autumn.
So even if there’s something like that happens,

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:49.090
it is compensated. It is compensated and so
beautiful it was, all the people were out

00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:55.600
in the autumn to see the beautiful colors
of the nature, of different greenery, yellow,

00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:03.590
ochre, all kinds of colors were there. Surprisingly,
in that country you never see all that. And

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:12.940
because of the sun shining so bright, it was
compensated. It was compensated by this Paramchaitanya.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:21.610
So the Paramchaitanya is looking after this.
All these things are managed by Paramchaitanya.

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:28.350
I am doing nothing. I am Nishkriya. I’m
just sitting down and watching. To Me nothing

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:33.780
matters. You see, it’s working out slowly
and steadily. Ha, if you tell Me something

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:38.230
supposing, they said, “Mother, we prayed
to You and it happened.” All right, maybe,

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:45.300
these people must have heard, around Me, Not
me, you see, and they must have done the job

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:49.930
and for that I’m not responsible, in no
way.

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:56.370
Like one lady in Mexico had a son, was very
sick and was about to die. She wrote a letter

00:30:56.370 --> 00:31:01.100
to Me, three letters she wrote that, “My
son is going to die, he’s a young fellow,

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:07.800
studying in Harvard.” I didn’t do anything.
I never wrote to her. Fourth letter came that

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:12.870
he’s completely cured. Now I didn’t do
that because I was just sitting in one place

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:18.900
and how is it, it has worked out.
So everything, you see, you think I do is

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:25.130
not done by Me. Is done by this Paramchaitanya.
Because I’m also separated from you, completely,

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:30.559
absolutely separated. So they say, “You
pray, now.” You can pray. If you pray, you

00:31:30.559 --> 00:31:36.000
pray to these deities that are around, you
pray to all these ganas and all that, not

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.690
to Me. Because I have nothing to do with it.
You see, they don’t tell Me that I have

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:46.830
to do this or I have to do that, so why should
I tell them do this or do that? It is like

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:49.559
that.
And in that state only we can say you are

00:31:49.559 --> 00:31:55.330
in a Sahaja state, where you don’t desire
anything, you don’t want anything. I do

00:31:55.330 --> 00:32:00.679
everything. All kinds of things, I am doing.
Like the sun is doing, I am also doing in

00:32:00.679 --> 00:32:10.250
the sense that I’m looking after things,
flowers, this that. I am also receiving presents

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:18.050
from you, I’m receiving this from you and
then see, I don’t receive anything. I don’t

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:24.090
have anything. I have no interest in it. But
you want to give for your joy, all right,

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:28.550
have it. You want to put flowers, all right,
you can have flowers. Even if there’s flowers

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:36.550
or not makes no difference to Me as a person,
I’m saying. But as Your Mother I love you.

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:42.410
All of you I love. But I don’t do anything
as such to love you. And everybody says, “Mother,

00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:47.140
You love us so much.” When? When did I love
you. I never even kissed you. But you always

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:54.040
say I love you very much. So what is this.
Who is working it out, this? Is something

00:32:54.040 --> 00:33:01.770
which is not Me, beyond Me. This is the state
in which, once we rise, we call it as Sahaja

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:07.740
Stithi. In the Sahaja Stithi you think you
are doing nothing. Everything is working out.

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:14.230
But at this stage if I tell you, you say,
“Oh, we are not doing anything. Why should

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:20.250
we spread Sahaja Yoga, it’s not our job?”
Just now, that’s not your stithi, that’s

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:24.200
why.
So you have to rise up to that state. That’s

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:31.360
only possible when you are in the knowledge
state, where you have self-knowledge, the

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:36.260
knowledge of the whole world. But if you go
beyond knowledge then you must have seen many

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:44.290
a times, I just say something. I just say
something and it is there. I never feel vibrations

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:50.570
of anyone or anything. I don’t feel My Kundalini,
either nor any chakras, nothing, but I know,

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:56.220
know automatically like a computer. But that
computer also I am not. Just it’s trouble,

00:33:56.220 --> 00:34:01.070
it’s difficult to explain to you what is
this stithi is because you have to achieve

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:08.480
it. Once you achieve it then you are in a
very subtle state and that subtle state is

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:18.230
nothing but bliss. But that bliss also you
cannot enjoy. I don’t know how to enjoy

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:25.520
everything. Supposing now you say, “Jai
Mataji.” I forget even you are calling Me.

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:34.230
I also say, “Jai Mataji,” finished.
See it is such a simple thing one has to understand

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:41.159
that the state in which one has to rise is
a state where without doing anything, everything

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:47.139
works out. If that is your state, all right.
But it’s not so. So you have to rise up

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:54.079
to that state by doing. First you have to
do it. First you have to know and then knowledge

00:34:54.079 --> 00:35:00.609
has no need, you don’t have to know, but
first that has to be worked out and brought

00:35:00.609 --> 00:35:05.630
to that level.
Now Diwali has the significance that on Diwali

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:16.109
day, what we do, we put lights all over. So
that we put Sahaja Yoga everywhere. But does

00:35:16.109 --> 00:35:28.589
the light know about itself? Does the candle
knows about itself? She enlightens everything

00:35:28.589 --> 00:35:41.420
but she doesn’t know. Like the moon, which
is giving moonlight, does it know itself?

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:52.140
Does he enjoy? Nothing. In the same way it
happens that on a Diwali day you are, what

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:57.019
you are doing is enlightening people, you
are enlightening them, you are doing all this

00:35:57.019 --> 00:36:02.999
for them, it’s a good idea. You must do
it. But also know that you have to become

00:36:02.999 --> 00:36:12.400
the lamp yourself which doesn’t know yourself.
So there are two messages. The first one is

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:17.549
that we have to enlighten the world, we have
to enlighten others. This is the first one.

00:36:17.549 --> 00:36:26.539
Then we have to become that which is the light
itself and light itself doesn’t know. Yesterday

00:36:26.539 --> 00:36:29.950
you were singing, “You are the light,”
you are this thing. All right, so what? I

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:37.700
was just saying, ‘Yes, I am the light, I
don’t know Myself.” That’s the state

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:42.869
where you don’t know you are the light.
You just don’t know that. It doesn’t come

00:36:42.869 --> 00:36:47.440
into your head. Even so many times you have
sung, you have said thousand names there are,

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:54.410
everything, but it doesn’t come into My
head that this is Me you are talking about.

00:36:54.410 --> 00:37:00.170
Now when I say this I don’t know how you
will react. Because human beings are queer

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:06.829
birds, you see. You tell them something. Maybe
that your ego might come up and you say, “Yes,

00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:12.400
yes, I am also just the same.” There are
many, many who came like that, that, “I

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:17.970
am higher than Mataji.” Ba, ba maybe, I
don’t know. There are many who said that,

00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:23.309
“I am Kalki.” Nowadays there’s one fellow
going round saying, “I am Kalki, I am this,

00:37:23.309 --> 00:37:41.569
I am that.” All right doesn’t matter.
You be that, very good idea.

00:37:41.569 --> 00:37:50.890
But if I say I am Adi Shakti that means I
don’t know what I am, really. I had to say

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:55.890
because people said, “Mother, you have to
declare.” Declare what? Whatever I am, that

00:37:55.890 --> 00:38:00.579
I am.
Now I find by declaration you people started

00:38:00.579 --> 00:38:09.499
growing more, so all right, have it that way.
But there is no need for anyone to declare

00:38:09.499 --> 00:38:14.650
anything or to say anything. That is the state
one has to achieve.

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:22.059
But to get to that state you have to work.
And work is to spread Sahaja Yoga. You have

00:38:22.059 --> 00:38:29.450
to enlighten many lights. That means you will
realize that you are the light which is enlightening

00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:37.339
all that, and then in a subtle way you will
realize that, “I am the light.” Many Sahaja

00:38:37.339 --> 00:38:43.499
Yogis are doing a lot of work and working
it out, spreading Sahaja Yoga. It’s a very

00:38:43.499 --> 00:38:50.059
great thing that has happened. In so many
countries, the way it has spread, it has removed

00:38:50.059 --> 00:38:57.849
the darkness of religion which was outside.
It was darkness of so many – racialism,

00:38:57.849 --> 00:39:06.859
thisism, thatism, all it has removed. So this
has worked out, the cleansing. For you to

00:39:06.859 --> 00:39:16.640
have the clean water to swim.
Once you start doing that then you realize

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:25.269
gradually that now the sea is clean, we just
watch, we just see how it is working. I hope

00:39:25.269 --> 00:39:35.390
in your lifetime only, you achieve this state
where you achieve your complete work of self-realization

00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:39.200
to others.
Those who do not give self-realization to

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:45.099
others, who just come for the pujas, this
thing, are mediocres. They cannot rise very

00:39:45.099 --> 00:39:50.450
high. This coming to puja is what, like, you
just rise higher with the puja then again

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:54.259
you go down.
But those who steadily grow will grow into

00:39:54.259 --> 00:40:00.980
this state, I am sure, in My lifetime I should
be able to see such people who are such that

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:06.029
if they stand here they emit peace, they emit
light, they emit everything. Because they

00:40:06.029 --> 00:40:12.369
are the light. They don’t have to enlighten,
but they are the light. Such a stage has to

00:40:12.369 --> 00:40:19.749
be developed and to be worked out within yourself.
And this state has been described by so many

00:40:19.749 --> 00:40:25.710
poets, so many saints and everything, but
they were at that stage and people thought,

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:29.269
what is this they are talking? They thought
they were mad. Even for Christ, they thought

00:40:29.269 --> 00:40:32.789
He is to be crucified, because they couldn’t
understand it.

00:40:32.789 --> 00:40:39.890
Now you are gradually growing one by one,
step by step, so now you understand this.

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:45.559
You understand Christ, you understand all
these people and at this stage you have still

00:40:45.559 --> 00:40:51.569
to work. Those who do not work for Sahaja
Yoga cannot rise higher. You have to work

00:40:51.569 --> 00:40:59.509
for Sahaja Yoga, you have to spread it more,
you have to work it out, enjoy each other,

00:40:59.509 --> 00:41:08.569
this brotherhood, everything. All the qualities
of a beautiful personality should be there.

00:41:08.569 --> 00:41:16.089
Unless and until you achieve that state, then
you can only rise higher to that stage which

00:41:16.089 --> 00:41:21.289
I am describing is a Sahaja Stithi. In that
state you will be perfect.

00:41:21.289 --> 00:41:28.619
But you must get rid of all these things and
today is a day, also of Maha Lakshmi. The

00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:35.989
first thing is, I think, this madness about
money. This should be understood that it’s

00:41:35.989 --> 00:41:41.269
real madness. Those who are rich have no money.
You ask a rich man, he’ll say, “Oh, I

00:41:41.269 --> 00:41:44.839
have no money.” Why? What is all this? “This
is no money”.

00:41:44.839 --> 00:41:53.989
You ask the poor man, he has no money. A rich
man has no money. So it’s a kind of a greed

00:41:53.989 --> 00:41:59.579
which is never satisfied, which never helps
you. All these little, little things have

00:41:59.579 --> 00:42:05.369
to first drop out. Then your work should cleanse
you. In your work you will know whether you

00:42:05.369 --> 00:42:08.849
are cleansing or not.
In the work you will know how you are doing

00:42:08.849 --> 00:42:16.599
your work. Once that is done, then I think
I am sure some of you will achieve that state

00:42:16.599 --> 00:42:22.130
in My lifetime, in your lifetime.
That’s what I want today to tell you, on

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:27.789
a Diwali day, that we have to become subtler
and subtler and subtler.

00:42:27.789 --> 00:42:36.809
We should not be influenced by outside things.
Like, the outside thing is that, some sort

00:42:36.809 --> 00:42:46.509
of a fashion starts. People who follow fashions
are stupid. They are like blind mices. Anybody

00:42:46.509 --> 00:42:50.900
can lead them into anything, now do this,
they do it. That, they do it.

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:59.160
So if you try to follow any kind of a thought
which is given to us by somebody else, in

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:04.279
that thought you’ll completely lose yourself
and you’ll become, “I am this, I am Christian,

00:43:04.279 --> 00:43:16.549
I am Hindu, I am Muslim, I am Muss leman.”
Stupidity. You are yourself. You are the Spirit.

00:43:16.549 --> 00:43:24.029
And when you become the Spirit then you start
knowing so much and that knowledge is very

00:43:24.029 --> 00:43:29.259
important.
This is the gap between a saint and a normal

00:43:29.259 --> 00:43:35.239
human being, which you have crossed gradually
so you know what are the problems of the human

00:43:35.239 --> 00:43:40.979
beings are and dealing with human beings,
you know how to deal with them.

00:43:40.979 --> 00:43:47.150
In Sahaja Yoga only the collective consciousness,
in modern times, has come. This collective

00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:53.339
consciousness, also the saints had, but they
would not say. They would not say anything.

00:43:53.339 --> 00:43:58.729
They would not bother.
All right, this fellow has this chakra, let

00:43:58.729 --> 00:44:05.130
him go to hell. Doesn’t care. It’s not
a question of not caring, but not bothered.

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:11.819
They were sitting in a state which was just
recording, all right. An ugly man goes before

00:44:11.819 --> 00:44:18.119
the mirror, all right, if a beautiful person
goes before the mirror is all right.

00:44:18.119 --> 00:44:26.529
In the same way these people start allowing
people to pass through but we have to understand,

00:44:26.529 --> 00:44:33.569
still we have to grow. We have to still grow
by working it out. Those people who are working

00:44:33.569 --> 00:44:45.799
it out and spreading it all over are the ones
which are really very much there and to them,

00:44:45.799 --> 00:44:52.779
I must say, the Paramchaitanya is just their
servant.

00:44:52.779 --> 00:45:01.009
I have seen people who desire something, it
works out. They ask for something, it works

00:45:01.009 --> 00:45:07.150
out. For that, now, what should we have, is
the point.

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:13.499
After getting realization, after getting everything,
what should we have that we develop is the

00:45:13.499 --> 00:45:26.829
faith. Faith in yourself. Faith in that you
are the Spirit, that you have the light and

00:45:26.829 --> 00:45:37.489
you have to enlighten others. This faith when
it grows deeper and deeper then you think,

00:45:37.489 --> 00:45:46.269
oh, what I am. I am the Spirit. If you are
the Spirit then this whole nature is with

00:45:46.269 --> 00:45:56.479
you. I know of some Sahaja Yogis. One of them
was a fisherman. He was doing Sahaja Yoga

00:45:56.479 --> 00:46:04.979
work. He has tremendous faith in Me and somehow
he was going to another village to do Sahaja

00:46:04.979 --> 00:46:11.019
Yoga work. When he came out of his little
hut he found it’s all full of clouds, black

00:46:11.019 --> 00:46:18.369
clouds. So he raised his hand and said, “See
now, I’m going for Mother’s work. And

00:46:18.369 --> 00:46:24.390
you dare not start raining. You keep as you
are, hanging there till I finish my work,”

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:29.739
you see. Because he was going by boat. And
other Sahaja Yogis thought, “What is he

00:46:29.739 --> 00:46:34.979
talking about?” They all got into the boat,
they reached the other village. They gave

00:46:34.979 --> 00:46:40.150
realization to others, he finished his lecturing,
everything, he came back on the shore and

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:45.440
he entered his house. When he was closing
the door, “All right, so go ahead,” he

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:50.650
said. And he managed.
So the complete faith that this Paramchaitanya

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:58.609
is like your servant, is all the time waiting
there to serve you. Whatever you say will

00:46:58.609 --> 00:47:05.549
happen. But first you must have complete faith
in yourself that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:47:05.549 --> 00:47:13.210
Even now I find, you see, people have some
lust, some sort of a horrible things in them.

00:47:13.210 --> 00:47:19.319
So first you must be established in Dharma.
Dharma, is, as you know, is righteousness.

00:47:19.319 --> 00:47:23.960
If you are in the righteousness, there’s
no question. There’s no question that this

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:30.589
Paramchaitanya won’t obey you. But supposing
you want today something and it doesn’t

00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:38.109
work out, then even to get disappointed itself
is not a very good thing. Disappointment also

00:47:38.109 --> 00:47:52.479
is a sign of your immaturity. What is there
to be disappointed? Maybe that that was good

00:47:52.479 --> 00:47:56.930
for you.
Supposing I lose My way. I’m going this

00:47:56.930 --> 00:48:03.519
way and I lose My way, I don’t know where
to go. So I get lost, it’s all right. What

00:48:03.519 --> 00:48:08.710
is there? Wherever I am, I am there. How can
I be lost to Myself. And then what I find,

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:14.039
that I had to go that way because I was to
meet somebody, I’ve been wanting to meet

00:48:14.039 --> 00:48:21.799
somebody and meet that person there. Can you
imagine? Such things happen with Me, and even

00:48:21.799 --> 00:48:27.160
if I don’t meet, so what? I was to go that
side. I have to leave some vibrations, perhaps.

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:33.049
It’s like that.
So once you know that whatever you are doing

00:48:33.049 --> 00:48:41.910
in command, full command, full faith, actually
the whole authority comes to you through your

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:47.450
faith which word is satta in Sanskrit, meaning
the truth.

00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:52.859
The truth gives you the authority. If you
have the truth with you, you have the absolute

00:48:52.859 --> 00:49:00.049
truth with you then you have the authority
and the authority is such that that authorizes

00:49:00.049 --> 00:49:07.890
you, not others, but to you. This authority
that you have works and works. I’ve seen

00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:15.009
with simple Sahaja Yogis, very simple uneducated
also, are very powerful Sahaja Yogis, are

00:49:15.009 --> 00:49:21.890
very powerful Sahaja Yogis. But they have
one thing, is faith, complete faith.

00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:31.249
Then another word in Sanskrit is titiksha,
means patience, suboori – patience. You

00:49:31.249 --> 00:49:35.979
must have patience. If you don’t have patience,
you want immediately something to be done.

00:49:35.979 --> 00:49:44.549
How will you see the whole thing working out?
Many people are extremely jittery and very

00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:51.940
fast-running. This world is running so fast
and you are the ones who have stood out and

00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:59.089
watching this rat race. You are not one of
them. So must have titiksha, means you must

00:49:59.089 --> 00:50:07.619
have patience. So you must have faith in yourself
fully and also patience, how Sahaja Yoga is

00:50:07.619 --> 00:50:11.609
working out or how this Paramchaitanya is
working out.

00:50:11.609 --> 00:50:17.160
If it works this way, all right, that way,
all right. It is some meaning. If it works

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:22.739
this way, there’s some meaning. If it is
that way it has some meaning.

00:50:22.739 --> 00:50:34.039
Now another thing which is important is the
faith in your guru. If you have faith in your

00:50:34.039 --> 00:50:41.880
guru, Paramchaitanya is kind to you. It’s
very helpful. But if you doubt, then Paramchaitanya

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:49.339
also doubts you because Paramchaitanya knows
you through your guru, whether it is Me or

00:50:49.339 --> 00:50:56.369
any other real guru, it’s the same. But
with Me, of course, because, you know, I’m

00:50:56.369 --> 00:51:02.999
very forgiving so people start taking liberties.
With another guru, you see, he will beat them.

00:51:02.999 --> 00:51:09.299
He’ll do all kinds of horrible things to
you if you are not there. So I’ve told you

00:51:09.299 --> 00:51:13.670
many stories about the gurus, how they treat
– good gurus – their disciples.

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:19.049
But I forgive. I don’t say anything. Let
it be, it doesn’t matter. Because I think

00:51:19.049 --> 00:51:25.329
by leaving them alone only, they will rise
and they will come up to this stage. But it

00:51:25.329 --> 00:51:33.759
happens sometimes that it may work the other
way round, that if they are forgiven, then

00:51:33.759 --> 00:51:50.969
they take it for granted. So the faith in
yourself is with patience you watch and do

00:51:50.969 --> 00:51:57.660
not get disappointed with anything whatsoever.
Now, just imagine so many people have got

00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:02.319
realization, so many saints in this world,
have you seen? Yesterday I was surprised the

00:52:02.319 --> 00:52:08.859
way the French were singing so well. You know,
first time I had to take a harmonium to teach

00:52:08.859 --> 00:52:18.369
them how to sing one line. Half an hour I
tried, I couldn’t do. The same French have

00:52:18.369 --> 00:52:25.190
reached that state of creativity.
You see, all your potential will rise. It

00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:33.029
will express itself, but be careful not to
get into ego about it. Gradually it will flower

00:52:33.029 --> 00:52:38.619
and others who are surrounding you will get
the fragrance of it and they’ll come to

00:52:38.619 --> 00:52:44.400
Sahaja Yoga. That is the blessing at that
time, the blessing of the real Divine will

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:52.190
be that you’ll be raised to the state which
we call as a perfect, ‘purnattwa’, complete.

00:52:52.190 --> 00:53:00.650
That completeness will come. But you judge
yourself. Are you absolutely one with Sahaj?

00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:06.640
Are you absolutely dedicated to Sahaj?
Or other things are more important to you

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:18.009
than Sahaja Yoga? Then, go ahead.
There is something to be understood very clearly

00:53:18.009 --> 00:53:23.589
that there’s no competition in Sahaja Yoga.
Cannot be. There’s no competition. There’s

00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:32.809
no envy, there is no back biting, nothing.
It is, you are different people. You are saints.

00:53:32.809 --> 00:53:40.839
Your style is different. You are absolutely
above all these things. You cannot be dishonest,

00:53:40.839 --> 00:53:46.099
you cannot cheat people, you cannot do this.
And if you are doing that, even now, then

00:53:46.099 --> 00:53:54.259
please try to understand that you have still
to grow into it. Some big people think they

00:53:54.259 --> 00:54:04.079
are very high up in Sahaja Yoga. It’s not
so, it’s not so. If by thinking what you

00:54:04.079 --> 00:54:13.900
are, then you are lost. What you have to do
is to understand “What have I done? How

00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:19.109
many people have I given realization, to how
many people have talked about it?” People

00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:23.789
are shy, even, to talk about Sahaja Yoga.
I have seen one lady was traveling with Me.

00:54:23.789 --> 00:54:27.900
Very hot. I said, “Ba, ba who is she, this
one? I don’t know.” So she told Me the

00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:32.599
name of her guru. She said, “My guru is
like this, guru like that, like that.” I

00:54:32.599 --> 00:54:36.989
said, “My God, this heat coming out of this
woman and she’s talking so much.” But

00:54:36.989 --> 00:54:42.569
a Sahaja Yogi will not tell anybody what is
Sahaja Yoga. They feel shy. They’ll have

00:54:42.569 --> 00:54:46.960
a hundred friends, they’ll meet a hundred
friends but they will never tell them what

00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:52.999
Sahaja Yoga is. They’ll be shy to tell them.
Ah, they wouldn’t mind going to parties,

00:54:52.999 --> 00:54:56.680
you see, if the others are drinking they’ll
say, “All right, I don’t drink.” But

00:54:56.680 --> 00:55:01.509
they’ll not say, “I’m a Sahaja Yogi,
I cannot drink, by nature I cannot drink.”

00:55:01.509 --> 00:55:06.700
They will not say that.
So this is the third point, one has to know

00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:14.779
the announcement. You must have faith in yourself
and you must announce. All the saints announced.

00:55:14.779 --> 00:55:20.849
They were killed for that, you saw how Socrates
was given poison. Doesn’t matter. Nobody’s

00:55:20.849 --> 00:55:26.410
going to kill you now, in these modern times,
there’s fundamental rights to exist. So

00:55:26.410 --> 00:55:30.839
nobody can kill you, take it from Me, but
you must announce. And the announcement should

00:55:30.839 --> 00:55:38.829
be with full faith and understanding about
Sahaja Yoga, how important it is.

00:55:38.829 --> 00:55:49.950
The purpose is to transform the whole world.
With your transformation the whole world transforms.

00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:55.229
It’s a very complicated thing, otherwise,
Sahaja Yoga is extremely complicated because

00:55:55.229 --> 00:56:00.029
how it works.
The other day, you remember, the mike had

00:56:00.029 --> 00:56:08.249
failed completely and I was giving the lecture
and still I was talking. The mike had failed

00:56:08.249 --> 00:56:14.799
but everybody was listening to Me. What had
happened? Did I enter into the ether? What

00:56:14.799 --> 00:56:19.769
happened? I don’t know. I didn’t even
know that mike had failed. I was thinking

00:56:19.769 --> 00:56:26.420
there is mike, that the way people were listening
to Me, but then they told that half lecture

00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:33.450
was without the mike. And everybody was absolutely
listening to Me.

00:56:33.450 --> 00:56:47.299
You see, it is something that one has to wonder
and appreciate what things are happening now,

00:56:47.299 --> 00:56:54.650
where are we going. We are going into the
Kingdom of God and all the blessings, all

00:56:54.650 --> 00:57:01.739
the bliss will be on you.
Then this bliss, knowledge, everything becomes

00:57:01.739 --> 00:57:09.549
one, nothing but bliss and you are in that
state of bliss which you don’t even know,

00:57:09.549 --> 00:57:17.289
you are just there. The greatest bliss is
that you don’t know even anything, you’re

00:57:17.289 --> 00:57:21.029
just there.
I hope all of you achieve that state with

00:57:21.029 --> 00:57:27.180
this Diwali being done in Portugal, which
is a special place, I think, of Maha Lakshmi

00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:32.989
because She appeared here as they say and
also this swayambu that we have, also is that

00:57:32.989 --> 00:57:37.180
of Maha Lakshmi face, so I’m sure it will
work out for all of you.

00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:45.369
It’s a little subtle state I’m talking
about but it is, I have to tell you, that

00:57:45.369 --> 00:57:52.670
one has to rise up to that state and that
state is very, very easy to achieve for you.

00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:57.769
It slowly, gradually it – then you don’t
have to do anything, you go into a village

00:57:57.769 --> 00:58:02.259
and everything would be there.
See, now, what happened. I went to Cairo.

00:58:02.259 --> 00:58:07.749
Everybody was saluting Me. I was wondering,
what has happened to them? I went to Leningrad,

00:58:07.749 --> 00:58:12.269
thousands came to My program. I asked them,
“How did you come to My program?” They

00:58:12.269 --> 00:58:17.079
said, “It’s obvious from Your face, it’s
obvious.” They just saw a small, little

00:58:17.079 --> 00:58:21.979
advertisement in the newspaper, “It’s
obvious that You are Divine.” That should

00:58:21.979 --> 00:58:28.989
happen. And then you can announce that Sahaja
Yoga is the only way, then you can announce.

00:58:28.989 --> 00:58:34.640
There’s no harm. People feel very shy to
say something to their friends and things.

00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:40.700
And you must know that all of those who you
love, who you know, will go to hell or where

00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:44.999
– they’ll hang in the limbo or what? If
you have achieved it you should pull them

00:58:44.999 --> 00:58:50.660
out also. They may not. They may not be seekers,
doesn’t matter now. I think we are finished

00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:55.950
with the seekers now, must be – we must
have people who are not so seeking, it looks

00:58:55.950 --> 00:59:01.600
like that.
So may God bless you all.
