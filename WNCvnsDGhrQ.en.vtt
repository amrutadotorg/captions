00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:15.472
It’s such a great pleasure to be here in
Colombia; which was my great desire, long

00:01:15.472 --> 00:01:27.551
time back that, somehow if I could come later
to this country, I may be able to start Sahaj

00:01:27.551 --> 00:01:28.551
Yoga here.

00:01:28.551 --> 00:01:36.162
Because I did feel, at that time that there
are lots of seekers and very good people in

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:37.162
Colombia.

00:01:37.162 --> 00:02:02.882
They are the seekers of truth and want to
rise higher in their awareness.

00:02:16.412 --> 00:02:22.308
And as it was desired by me, it has worked
out.

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:34.022
I’m very happy to be here among you people;
and we have people from, also, other countries

00:02:34.022 --> 00:02:45.942
of South America which is a very great thing.

00:02:45.942 --> 00:02:58.693
We started working out in European countries,
which were developed countries we can say,

00:02:58.733 --> 00:03:06.832
but I always had a very earnest desire to
come to the other side, that is the underdeveloped

00:03:06.832 --> 00:03:14.513
countries, where there is culture.

00:03:14.513 --> 00:03:29.053
It has to spread to all the countries.

00:03:29.053 --> 00:03:35.943
No country should say that it did not come
to us, that we did not know the truth, that

00:03:35.943 --> 00:03:47.843
we missed the point.

00:03:47.843 --> 00:04:04.993
As you people are first founders and the foundation
stones of Sahaj Yoga you have to be very careful.

00:04:04.993 --> 00:04:20.503
As I have said, many a times, the knowledge
that we have from science and other things

00:04:20.573 --> 00:04:30.993
is the knowledge of the tree, but Sahaj Yoga
is the knowledge of the roots.

00:04:38.927 --> 00:04:47.160
So, we have to become deeper personalities,
we have to see our own depths and our own

00:04:47.147 --> 00:05:00.412
glories and our own beauties, and to enjoy
them.

00:05:00.492 --> 00:05:10.762
All that beauty we can have; plus you can
see that the human beings are part and parcel

00:05:10.762 --> 00:05:13.732
of one personality.

00:05:22.112 --> 00:05:27.742
But we cannot do it by just lecturing or by
giving sermons.

00:05:27.762 --> 00:05:44.392
But we have to prove it to them by their ascent,
that is, by giving them Self-realisation,

00:05:44.392 --> 00:05:55.832
by the actualisation of the experience.

00:05:58.082 --> 00:06:04.602
In every way we have to tell them that the
truth cannot be found out by paying money

00:06:04.602 --> 00:06:08.542
or making efforts or by sufferings.

00:06:08.542 --> 00:06:24.072
The truth resides within us and we have to
just reconcile to the idea that, so far, we

00:06:24.072 --> 00:06:33.372
have not found it.

00:06:33.372 --> 00:06:36.542
Now the way you will handle them is very important.

00:06:36.542 --> 00:06:41.082
Because they come to my program, get Realisation.

00:06:41.082 --> 00:07:01.592
But when they come back then you have to handle
them very carefully and delicately.

00:07:01.592 --> 00:07:10.462
Also you must understand what is the pulse
of your country, what is the specialty of

00:07:10.462 --> 00:07:15.302
your country.
