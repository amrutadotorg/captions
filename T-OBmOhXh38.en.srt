1
00:00:12,352 --> 00:00:19,781
Now this left-hand side of the heart is
concerned with your mother

2
00:00:19,982 --> 00:00:29,048
and with Shiva, the existence. You get
your existence through your mother.

3
00:00:29,249 --> 00:00:36,266
And Shiva and Parvati they are your
parents, both of them, are your parents,

4
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:41,273
as far as your existence is concerned.

5
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:49,414
And it is such a beautiful center is your
heart center.

6
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:53,867
You want somebody to do something
for you, try this.

7
00:00:54,068 --> 00:00:57,593
You want that somebody should yield
or something,

8
00:00:57,794 --> 00:00:59,734
you find somebody very obstinate, I mean

9
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:03,313
I have told you that you can beat them
with shoes, do all those things.

10
00:01:03,514 --> 00:01:06,281
But there’s a very simple way if you know
how to do it:

11
00:01:06,482 --> 00:01:13,360
you see, you just think of their Hriday,
their heart, and put a bandhan to that.

12
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:19,211
And you can do it so beautifully. You can
melt a person

13
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:23,539
without any difficulties if you know how
to handle their heart.

14
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,328
You have to appeal to their heart.

15
00:01:27,529 --> 00:01:34,783
And that’s the best attraction, I tell you,
and the best secret method by which

16
00:01:34,984 --> 00:01:39,060
you can bring good in them when you are
talking to somebody.

17
00:01:39,261 --> 00:01:43,807
Supposing I, now - intellectually if I
start quarrelling with you,

18
00:01:44,008 --> 00:01:48,386
you will give Me up in no time! But I have
to use your heart power

19
00:01:48,587 --> 00:01:52,684
and I have to enter into your heart, and
that is how it works.

20
00:01:52,885 --> 00:01:55,581
So always when you want to do something
like that,

21
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:59,971
just humble down yourself in your heart,
that is first.

22
00:02:00,172 --> 00:02:03,355
First of all you must humble down yourself
in your heart.

23
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:06,052
And from there work on the heart of other.

24
00:02:06,253 --> 00:02:11,752
Just put a bandhan and you will see,
a person will melt away.

25
00:02:11,953 --> 00:02:15,221
We melt our intelligence, our ego,

26
00:02:15,422 --> 00:02:18,511
everything, even your superego, in your
heart.

27
00:02:18,712 --> 00:02:22,160
So it’s a very easy thing if you know
how to approach people

28
00:02:22,361 --> 00:02:30,472
through their heart. And that is only
possible if you are genuine,

29
00:02:30,673 --> 00:02:35,872
because genuineness is something
that a heart recognizes.

30
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,956
You can befool a person with your
cunning methods,

31
00:02:39,157 --> 00:02:43,636
but the heart will recognize it later on,
and the person will hate you.

32
00:02:43,837 --> 00:02:45,706
Even if you talk to someone, “Oh, thank
you very much,

33
00:02:45,907 --> 00:02:48,065
oh, very good, thank you very much,
very nice.”

34
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:52,042
And the heart knows: “Oh, he is trying
to befool me and he is very cunning.”

35
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,823
The heart is going to hate such a person.

36
00:02:55,024 --> 00:02:58,902
And heart has the eyes to see and feel
the person.

37
00:02:59,103 --> 00:03:01,513
So if you could appeal to somebody’s heart

38
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:06,325
and put a bandhan on the heart you can
melt that person.

39
00:03:06,526 --> 00:03:10,933
And if you love someone and if you want
that person should be corrected -

40
00:03:11,134 --> 00:03:13,549
supposing such a person is a drunkard,

41
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,565
or a person who beats you and is torturing
you,

42
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:21,761
because he’s under the spell of some drugs
or some sort of a foreign thing -

43
00:03:21,962 --> 00:03:28,802
then you just put bandhan to his heart
and you will see, they’ll be changing.

44
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:32,324
They’ll be changing very fast. And that’s
why you say “change of heart”.

45
00:03:32,525 --> 00:03:35,582
Everywhere you’ll find, in every scripture
it is written,

46
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:38,816
change of heart is needed, not the change
of clothes.

47
00:03:39,017 --> 00:03:43,152
So it’s not intellectual changing, but -
or rational changing,

48
00:03:43,353 --> 00:03:49,708
but it is the change of heart, and that is
brought about by moving

49
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:56,152
the heart chakra on the right-hand side
in the clockwise manner -

50
00:03:56,353 --> 00:03:59,784
that is the heart itself, in the clockwise
manner.

51
00:03:59,985 --> 00:04:03,722
If you can do that, you can really do
marvels.

52
00:04:03,923 --> 00:04:10,628
And that’s how, on a collective basis,
the heart is sort of the innermost,

53
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:19,362
innermost string of the collective; one
string that is passing through all of us.

54
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:21,645
So if you could strike at the innermost -

55
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:26,620
because in a 3 and 1\2 circle that’s
the innermost point -

56
00:04:26,821 --> 00:04:30,019
if you touch there, it passes over this.

57
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,550
Supposing you touch somewhere else
then it might break.

58
00:04:33,751 --> 00:04:37,057
But at the beginning if you start striking
it, it goes

59
00:04:37,258 --> 00:04:43,357
very nicely and passes into complete
circumference.

60
00:04:43,558 --> 00:04:47,978
Now the center one I have told you is
the heart plexus,

61
00:04:48,179 --> 00:04:52,721
which we call as cardiac plexus, and
it has got ten (twelve) sub-plexuses.

62
00:04:52,922 --> 00:04:54,968
And the English names for that I will,

63
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,039
again I’m going to give you the complete
list. I don’t know when will I have time

64
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,265
to go through the medical journal, but
I’ll find out all of them.

65
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:05,461
And I’m going to tell you what they call it
in the medical terminology.

66
00:05:05,662 --> 00:05:09,851
But they know that there are ten (twelve)
sub-plexuses which are supplying

67
00:05:10,052 --> 00:05:14,197
to the muscles of the heart, to the lungs
and to the right-side lungs

68
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:19,049
and that’s how they divide it. But they do
not know that it is already three parts

69
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,134
and then there are ten petals which
are working it out –

70
00:05:23,335 --> 00:05:25,760
I’m sorry, twelve petals that are working
it out.

71
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:30,416
So three divided into twelve is four each
side.

72
00:05:30,617 --> 00:05:33,612
But actually it is not so.

73
00:05:33,813 --> 00:05:41,219
It is the twelve petals are together
in the center,

74
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:47,538
and the center one is known as
the “sacred heart”.

75
00:05:47,739 --> 00:05:56,941
In the Bible it is called as “sacred heart”
and this, the sacredness of that heart

76
00:05:57,142 --> 00:06:03,510
in the abstract form is the motherly love
of God.

77
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:07,758
That’s why the Jagadamba, the Mother
of the Universe, resides in that place.

78
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:15,281
And these, those twelve petals act
according to the Mother of the heart,

79
00:06:15,482 --> 00:06:18,484
and that’s why we cannot allot them
to this side or that side,

80
00:06:18,685 --> 00:06:22,967
because it is She who actually makes them
pulsate.

81
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:28,765
So here She becomes the dominant person
and not the heart. There the Spirit rules.

82
00:06:28,966 --> 00:06:33,187
So Spirit has rules by itself, and it is
ruled

83
00:06:33,388 --> 00:06:40,621
with the help of the reflection of God
Almighty Himself.

84
00:06:40,822 --> 00:06:46,371
It is on its own, it is arbitrary. It sees,
it watches, it is the witness.

85
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:50,481
It watches the play of these ten petals –
twelve petals here.

86
00:06:50,682 --> 00:06:56,474
But if it finds that there’s too much
of strain on the center one,

87
00:06:56,675 --> 00:07:02,826
it just switches off. And when it’s
switched off the whole thing stops.

88
00:07:03,027 --> 00:07:08,896
You see? So you must understand the
difference between the other, other chakras

89
00:07:09,097 --> 00:07:14,466
and this one is, that there is the Spirit
on one side

90
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:17,295
and the Mother on the other side,
and on the other side

91
00:07:17,496 --> 00:07:24,527
is a human perfect personality. Three
things altogether.

92
00:07:24,728 --> 00:07:27,957
Now, if you reduce them to our three 
powers, you’d understand it.

93
00:07:28,158 --> 00:07:32,810
On one side is the instrument, or you
can say

94
00:07:33,011 --> 00:07:38,675
the nucleus for the left-hand side working.

95
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,784
In the center it is,

96
00:07:40,985 --> 00:07:44,591
or you can say the left-hand side working,
you can say the Mahakali’s working.

97
00:07:44,792 --> 00:07:48,590
In the center, you can say, it is for
the Mahalakshmi working.

98
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:55,060
And the nucleus for the working
of the right-hand side

99
00:07:55,261 --> 00:07:59,864
is in the heart, on the right-hand side
where Rama resides.

100
00:08:00,065 --> 00:08:05,020
Because we can call it a nucleus. The
reason is He was active, He was active

101
00:08:05,221 --> 00:08:09,661
without feeling, without feeling
the witness state.

102
00:08:09,862 --> 00:08:16,925
Now they combined here where Krishna came
and He felt the witness state.

103
00:08:17,126 --> 00:08:19,948
And He called it as Leela, is the whole
play.

104
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:23,965
Rama never called it as play, but He
called it as play.

105
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:29,895
So that’s why Krishna here is completed
and that’s why we call Him a Sampurna,

106
00:08:30,096 --> 00:08:34,510
is a complete incarnation, at here.

107
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,472
(…) But now, this coming back to the heart
again.

108
00:08:37,673 --> 00:08:40,792
On the right-hand side we have got Rama’s
place.

109
00:08:40,993 --> 00:08:48,284
Now Rama was known for His obedience
to His father, if you know His story.

110
00:08:48,485 --> 00:08:55,339
His father was in Ayodhya, he was ruling
there, and he had three wives.

111
00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:01,621
The third wife had no – I mean, she had
two sons,

112
00:09:01,822 --> 00:09:06,769
but she could not see Rama getting
the throne.

113
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:09,550
She was a very nice mother, but somebody,
you see,

114
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:11,508
some lady went and told something to her

115
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:15,245
and she listened to her and she told
her husband that,

116
00:09:15,446 --> 00:09:20,331
“If you want to give me my boon,
the promised boon,

117
00:09:20,532 --> 00:09:25,074
you have to make Rama go into the jungle
for fourteen years,

118
00:09:25,275 --> 00:09:30,539
and give the throne to my son Bharat.”

119
00:09:32,492 --> 00:09:39,448
And when Dashratha heard this, he fainted,
he fainted with this request.

120
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:42,004
But Rama was there, He heard it

121
00:09:42,205 --> 00:09:46,332
and He immediately told her that “I’m going
to the forest and I’ve accepted it.

122
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:49,612
And you appoint your son as the Bharat,
for me, it’s alright.”

123
00:09:49,813 --> 00:09:54,005
And that’s how He went, you see. Just
to obey the order of His father,

124
00:09:54,205 --> 00:09:57,839
because father had not even ordered,
but because he was compelled.

125
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,503
He had given his wife two boons,

126
00:10:00,704 --> 00:10:04,019
that once you see, in a war she saved
his life, so he said that

127
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,933
“Whenever you want, you can ask 
for these two boons.”

128
00:10:07,134 --> 00:10:10,737
And they were, she never knew that she
would use them in such a funny way.

129
00:10:10,938 --> 00:10:14,770
Later on she repented, because Bharata
came and He refused to accept the throne

130
00:10:14,971 --> 00:10:19,152
and he put only Rama’s slippers there and
ruled there, and everything was different.

131
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:25,238
But Dashratha died, because when Rama
went away, he just died.

132
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:32,511
So you see, Rama’s life shows how
He was obedient

133
00:10:32,712 --> 00:10:36,353
to His parents. He suffered so much.

134
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:41,044
Anyone who has not been respectful
to his parents…

135
00:10:41,245 --> 00:10:49,544
You see, if your parents have been unkind,
you have every right

136
00:10:49,745 --> 00:10:51,730
to tell them that they should not be unkind
to you

137
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:58,481
and that you feel hurt, but you have
no business to answer them back

138
00:10:58,682 --> 00:11:01,966
and you have to be respectful, you have
to be respectful

139
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:06,605
because they represent your primordial
parents.

140
00:11:06,806 --> 00:11:11,801
You are not to shout at them and misbehave.
You have to be respectful to them.

141
00:11:12,002 --> 00:11:15,271
They may be bad people, but you have
to respect them,

142
00:11:15,472 --> 00:11:19,732
because you have chosen them. When you
were born, you chose them.

143
00:11:19,933 --> 00:11:23,847
You could not have been born to them,
you have really chosen them

144
00:11:24,048 --> 00:11:27,015
and you said, “These are going to be
my parents.”

145
00:11:27,216 --> 00:11:31,927
So if they are your parents, they are there
because of certain reasons,

146
00:11:32,128 --> 00:11:33,610
because you have been seeking them

147
00:11:33,811 --> 00:11:37,201
in your previous lives and that’s how
you are there.

148
00:11:37,402 --> 00:11:41,279
(…) You’re not to boss over them,
it’s real, I’m telling you the secret.

149
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,982
Is not for anything for you see, to make
you change your ways or anything,

150
00:11:46,183 --> 00:11:48,505
but I’m just telling you the secret because
you have lost

151
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:53,161
the idea of the secretive methods
of winning over people

152
00:11:53,362 --> 00:11:57,588
and understanding them and managing them,
and really you will have your way.

153
00:11:57,789 --> 00:12:01,038
Only thing is to respect them.
