00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:07.719
First of all we should know what powers
we have got,

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.606
and also we should know how we are going
to preserve those powers

00:00:11.807 --> 00:00:17.780
and what more powers we can very - very
easily achieve.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.129
The first power that you get after
Realisation

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.026
is the greatest power on Earth.

00:00:57.365 --> 00:01:00.708
This is the power of Shri Ganesha.

00:01:04.337 --> 00:01:11.254
It is only He can do this job that you
people are doing today,

00:01:11.455 --> 00:01:16.486
and that power is of raising the Kundalini.

00:01:19.288 --> 00:01:25.542
No one so far in the history
of spirituality

00:01:25.743 --> 00:01:32.060
has ever raised the Kundalini in such
a short time as you people are doing.

00:01:32.261 --> 00:01:37.928
It moves under your fingers; it is
absolutely Shri Ganesha’s power

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:40.869
which is given to you.

00:01:44.247 --> 00:01:49.934
At the time when you are giving
the Realisation,

00:01:51.788 --> 00:01:59.230
even if you are caught up in any one
of your chakras,

00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:04.576
or you have any problem, even if you are
little bit possessed,

00:02:04.777 --> 00:02:11.221
even if you are not such a good sahaj yogi,

00:02:11.422 --> 00:02:15.655
even if you are not that much surrendered
to Mataji,

00:02:15.856 --> 00:02:24.958
even if you don’t have much sense
of obligation about Sahaj Yoga,

00:02:25.161 --> 00:02:30.201
still the Kundalini rises under your
fingers.

00:02:31.677 --> 00:02:37.501
This Ganesh Shakti is given to you
by Shri Ganesh Himself within you;

00:02:37.702 --> 00:02:41.014
to give you the confidence,

00:02:41.215 --> 00:02:45.017
to give you the confidence that
you can raise the Kundalini,

00:02:45.218 --> 00:02:55.746
but not the feeling that you are raising
the Kundalini.

00:02:56.385 --> 00:03:02.334
If you go on without surrendering yourself
to Sahaj Yoga,

00:03:02.535 --> 00:03:07.285
after some time you will lose this power,
very fast.

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:13.235
The another power which you have got

00:03:13.436 --> 00:03:18.765
- at the raising of the Kundalini
of anyone,

00:03:19.064 --> 00:03:26.989
you can notice it that, when the Kundalini
rises, that time

00:03:27.578 --> 00:03:31.871
there will be no obstruction of any kind.

00:03:33.642 --> 00:03:36.618
Whatever may be the obstructions around

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.427
– say there’s a possessed person next door,

00:03:40.628 --> 00:03:45.409
he would not disturb you at that time.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.272
In your family there may be a person
who is a negative person,

00:03:49.457 --> 00:03:55.778
but if you are raising the Kundalini,
at that moment he will be kept quiet.

00:03:56.456 --> 00:03:59.256
At the time when you are moving
your hand on the Kundalini,

00:03:59.457 --> 00:04:03.059
is the greatest power you are using.

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:05.298
I don’t know how much shraddha you have

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:08.948
about yourself and about the power that
you have.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.153
At that time there will be no obstruction

00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:17.531
on your hand by anyone whatsoever!

00:04:17.732 --> 00:04:25.770
Even by mistake, nobody will hold
your hand or touch your hand.

00:04:33.574 --> 00:04:44.375
The second power you have got when
you are raising the Kundalini, that,

00:04:47.101 --> 00:04:52.151
at that time when you’ll be raising
your Kundalini,

00:04:53.013 --> 00:04:59.727
you will be completely attracting
the attention of the another person within,

00:05:02.798 --> 00:05:05.460
like a magnet,

00:05:08.403 --> 00:05:12.315
by which you should understand that
you can raise your Kundalini

00:05:12.516 --> 00:05:16.134
whenever you feel like. When you
are raising the Kundalini, supposing

00:05:16.335 --> 00:05:19.370
there’s lot of noise going on,

00:05:20.607 --> 00:05:25.624
there are all kinds of problems going on –
supposing you are going in the train,

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:31.446
there’s a noise of the train, or any
such thing happening –

00:05:32.088 --> 00:05:38.782
that time your attention will not be
distracted,

00:05:38.983 --> 00:05:46.405
but the attention of the person who is
taking the Realisation from you

00:05:46.606 --> 00:05:51.003
will not be attracted by outside things

00:05:51.204 --> 00:05:54.192
at that time when you are raising
the Kundalini.

00:05:54.393 --> 00:05:57.903
Or - that means that you can give
Realisation at any time,

00:05:58.104 --> 00:06:05.380
because at that time you reside
in the lotus which is closed.

00:06:11.878 --> 00:06:16.173
The other power you have got,

00:06:17.782 --> 00:06:22.418
at the time of Kundalini jagruti
(awakening),

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:30.697
that no baser feelings will rise within
you.

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:36.528
Even if you are a possessed person,
at the time of Kundalini jagruti

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:40.606
you will not have baser feelings, impure
feelings

00:06:40.807 --> 00:06:44.697
about the person whom you are giving
Realisation.

00:06:44.898 --> 00:06:49.729
Maybe before and after, but not during,
when you are giving Realisation,

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.993
these dirty feelings will not come to you.

00:06:53.194 --> 00:06:59.355
Automatically, you don’t have to stop
your mind, automatically it will work out.

00:06:59.809 --> 00:07:03.502
You will be absolutely satisfied, even
if you are hungry

00:07:03.703 --> 00:07:08.002
you will not feel the hunger or any
physical need,

00:07:08.203 --> 00:07:11.627
at the time when you are giving
Realisation.

00:07:11.828 --> 00:07:17.331
There will be no distraction of any kind;
you won’t do anything

00:07:17.532 --> 00:07:26.586
that is indignified at the time when
you will be raising your hand, because

00:07:29.038 --> 00:07:34.717
you are been blessed with dignity.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:39.596
At the time when you are raising
the Kundalini, you will never joke,

00:07:39.797 --> 00:07:43.376
or you’ll never make fun, you’ll not be
frivolous – automatically!

00:07:43.577 --> 00:07:49.313
You try: it won’t work out.

00:07:53.413 --> 00:07:57.753
These are your supporting powers.

00:07:57.954 --> 00:08:03.716
All these five powers I have described
are very few

00:08:04.417 --> 00:08:11.083
of the thousands others, but these are
the five powers of Shri Ganesh.

00:08:19.057 --> 00:08:24.762
Now, these powers can be maintained

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:31.902
if you try to follow Shri Ganesh.

00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:39.486
His foremost quality is that He does not
know any other God or anybody else

00:08:39.687 --> 00:08:42.923
higher than His own Mother.

00:08:43.131 --> 00:08:47.749
A complete dedication and complete
obedience to Mother.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:52.824
I mean, sort of He is made out
of that obedience.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:59.165
Complete love and affection for the Mother.

00:08:59.564 --> 00:09:03.572
He doesn’t argue, He doesn’t question,
He doesn’t do anything,

00:09:03.773 --> 00:09:08.626
and that’s how these powers are, in Him,
the maximum.

00:09:08.981 --> 00:09:15.112
If you think by arguing with Me you are
gaining, you are sadly mistaken.

00:09:16.324 --> 00:09:24.754
You have to keep Me pleased. Even Ganesha
tries every minute to keep Me pleased.

00:09:26.848 --> 00:09:33.584
Is a fact. So, please don’t try
to displease Me.

00:09:33.786 --> 00:09:41.030
I may not say anything because outwardly
I don’t say anything,

00:09:41.231 --> 00:09:44.857
but your powers will be reduced.

00:09:50.613 --> 00:09:59.267
The Ganesha’s fifth power is the power
of wisdom

00:09:59.468 --> 00:10:06.246
and that whatever He knows He can
draw it and write it down.

00:10:08.083 --> 00:10:12.356
Even that power you have got.

00:10:12.557 --> 00:10:19.617
When you are raising the Kundalini, you
talk to the person in such a manner

00:10:19.818 --> 00:10:25.719
that a person becomes wise.

00:10:26.357 --> 00:10:33.076
And you also talk to him only that
which is wisdom

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:41.488
and also you write or show him figures,
automatically which are right.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:47.742
Even if you don’t remember your figures,
they’ll come out right.

00:10:53.026 --> 00:10:58.966
Now the three powers of Adi Shakti work
in you.

00:11:00.098 --> 00:11:03.320
One gives you longevity

00:11:07.227 --> 00:11:11.868
and clear-cut idea about your desires.

00:11:16.112 --> 00:11:19.499
See, if your desires are right,

00:11:20.465 --> 00:11:25.873
all your desires are fulfilled by this
power – all your desires, all!

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:31.016
But the first one, one should know,
that your desires should be right.

00:11:31.217 --> 00:11:35.256
For example, now sahaja yogis want
their ashram.

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:39.962
Why do they want ashram for?

00:11:41.747 --> 00:11:45.371
How many are willing to stay in the ashram?

00:11:48.066 --> 00:11:53.267
How many are going to take their children
in the ashram?

00:11:55.499 --> 00:12:01.128
How many are going to give their exclusive
homes and take their wives

00:12:01.329 --> 00:12:07.609
or take their husbands who are not
sahaja yogis in the ashram?

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.503
And how many of them are wanting only
ashram

00:12:10.704 --> 00:12:15.256
just because they will have some
place to live in a cheap manner?

00:12:16.428 --> 00:12:20.526
What is the purpose of getting ashram?

00:12:21.455 --> 00:12:28.301
Are you sure about it? Have you been able
to find out why do you want an ashram?

00:12:29.238 --> 00:12:32.705
If your desires are clear-cut

00:12:34.728 --> 00:12:41.528
then they will be fulfilled, absolutely
hundred percent.

00:12:43.141 --> 00:12:48.349
That power you can achieve only by putting
your bandhan on your heart.

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:52.295
Whatever desire you have, you say it
and put it on your heart.

00:12:52.496 --> 00:12:57.788
Means you are asking from your heart.
Seven times, you just give it a bandhan,

00:12:57.989 --> 00:13:00.458
and the work will be done.

00:13:02.373 --> 00:13:05.953
But don’t use it for nonsensical things,

00:13:06.154 --> 00:13:11.663
because if you use it for nonsensical
things, this power will go away.

00:13:13.007 --> 00:13:18.525
Use for something special, of a higher
level.

00:13:21.744 --> 00:13:25.772
Now, by your second power

00:13:26.544 --> 00:13:33.907
you will automatically meet people who are
learned and who are sahaja.

00:13:34.479 --> 00:13:39.255
You will also read books which are sahaja.

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:44.440
Even if you have to read some other books,
you will be able to know

00:13:44.641 --> 00:13:48.199
that this is not correct and this is
correct.

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:58.641
And by that you will be enriching your
mind.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.879
When you will start speaking, people will
be amazed.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.863
Those who have never spoken would be
speaking very well.

00:14:06.064 --> 00:14:10.328
Those who have never known poetry will be
writing poetry.

00:14:13.129 --> 00:14:16.598
Lots of things will happen on the field
of art also.

00:14:16.799 --> 00:14:21.842
Those who did not know art will do
marvelously in art.

00:14:24.394 --> 00:14:32.000
But by the first power, which is the Adi
Shakti’s power, or Mahakali’s power,

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:38.634
you get the love of all the people around.

00:14:40.214 --> 00:14:45.040
Everybody will feel magnetically attracted
towards you.

00:14:46.765 --> 00:14:56.890
And you will be always guided by great
souls and angels.

00:14:59.104 --> 00:15:02.876
If you come across anybody who is meeting
an accident,

00:15:03.077 --> 00:15:06.615
you will stop that man from going that way.

00:15:06.816 --> 00:15:10.320
If you are in an accident, everybody
will be saved.

00:15:10.521 --> 00:15:15.844
You will seldom have an accident - if you
have it, you won’t be hurt much. Amazing!

00:15:16.045 --> 00:15:21.877
All these powers come to you because
you are the children of Adi Shakti.

00:15:22.078 --> 00:15:30.778
The whole Universe of the subtle,
Divine Power

00:15:30.979 --> 00:15:36.010
is looking after you individually. You are
all marked,

00:15:36.211 --> 00:15:43.713
the mark is on you, you are bearing
the mark, and They are looking after you.

00:15:51.566 --> 00:16:00.628
So this power of desiring is the power
that protects you.

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:07.263
In all the way that is possible it guides
you,

00:16:08.411 --> 00:16:13.133
it looks after you, it gives you peace.

00:16:19.098 --> 00:16:27.304
And this power gives you tremendous faith
in Sahaj Yoga.

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:35.861
Ultimately you become filled with the joy
of Sahaj Yoga,

00:16:36.062 --> 00:16:43.034
and you don’t like anything else but Sahaj
Yoga. To you, everything is Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:43.235 --> 00:16:45.608
But sometimes, you know, we are identified
with our ego

00:16:45.809 --> 00:16:49.217
and we think our ego is Sahaj Yog,
many-a-times I have seen it.

00:16:49.418 --> 00:16:52.531
People like it because it is identified
with their ego.

00:16:52.732 --> 00:16:59.994
It should be separated from that and should
be brought in our lives.

00:17:00.195 --> 00:17:02.402
In our day-to-day life,

00:17:02.571 --> 00:17:04.907
when we are meeting each other,
when we are talking to each other,

00:17:05.108 --> 00:17:09.913
that joy one should see, one ripple falling

00:17:10.114 --> 00:17:13.933
and another rising, another falling,
as you see in the sea.

00:17:14.134 --> 00:17:19.425
Becoming one with each other.
This power is within you

00:17:20.227 --> 00:17:26.227
and it is working all the time that you
are loved and you are looked after.

00:17:26.821 --> 00:17:31.434
By the middle power, I have told you,
you’ll give Realization to people.

00:17:31.635 --> 00:17:33.797
You’ll be able to tell their chakras.

00:17:33.998 --> 00:17:40.086
You’ll be able to correct your chakras.
This is all by your centre power.

00:17:40.287 --> 00:17:43.759
And by this power only you have

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:47.128
a very great power over your will.

00:17:47.329 --> 00:17:52.790
If you decide that you are going to be
like this, you will be.

00:17:53.942 --> 00:17:57.699
If you want to be a happy person you
will be.

00:17:57.901 --> 00:18:02.937
The transformation will be at your hand.

00:18:03.138 --> 00:18:08.044
You can transform yourself without
any difficulty,

00:18:08.246 --> 00:18:18.296
that will work out, if you use the central
power of Mahalakshmi.

00:18:19.931 --> 00:18:23.896
Of course, you will get better jobs,

00:18:24.097 --> 00:18:27.792
better money, prospects, but not too much
of it.

00:18:27.993 --> 00:18:32.175
So much so, that you will feel very much
satisfied about it,

00:18:32.376 --> 00:18:36.311
so that your attention is more
in the centre.

00:18:36.762 --> 00:18:42.352
All other powers of Mahalakshmi you will
achieve later on.

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:49.670
There are many other powers of Mahalakshmi
which you have to achieve,

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:53.340
but for that your Sushumna has to be
cleaned very much.

00:18:53.541 --> 00:18:56.732
For that, you have to develop detachment
in life.

00:18:56.933 --> 00:19:04.559
Unless and until you develop detachment,
the deeper powers of

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:11.752
Mahalakshmi do not come up. For example,
even in the smaller things,

00:19:11.953 --> 00:19:19.244
like having connection with Me,

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.005
even that one is to be a detached thing.

00:19:24.206 --> 00:19:32.485
Even to say Aarti or to do something,
to come forward, that, “I have to do it.”

00:19:32.686 --> 00:19:38.049
Even to invite Me for dinner or this thing,

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:43.206
every small thing, that “I should do it,”
is also attachment.

00:19:43.407 --> 00:19:46.325
If it works out, well and good; if it does
not work out, well and good.

00:19:46.526 --> 00:19:50.005
You must say that, “Mother, You come.”
But if I cannot come,

00:19:50.206 --> 00:19:53.367
there should not be slightest feeling
and unhappiness,

00:19:53.568 --> 00:19:56.146
but should be accepted as a part of that.

00:19:56.347 --> 00:20:00.444
This detachment has to be developed
for your Mahalakshmi Power.

00:20:00.645 --> 00:20:03.361
Then you go beyond.

00:20:08.902 --> 00:20:13.400
Your timing will be worked out absolutely
correctly –

00:20:13.601 --> 00:20:16.316
you wouldn’t need – you wouldn’t have
to see the time.

00:20:16.517 --> 00:20:20.197
There will be time which will be your own.

00:20:20.398 --> 00:20:24.678
Whenever you will go, you’ll find
everything worked out well.

00:20:24.879 --> 00:20:30.673
So, to preserve this power of time,
you must not hurry-up too much,

00:20:30.874 --> 00:20:33.941
you should not be slaves of watches.

00:20:34.691 --> 00:20:40.232
Just let it go. Do not have any obstinacy
about anything. Just doesn’t matter:

00:20:40.433 --> 00:20:43.701
if it is ten o’clock, alright; if not,
if ten fifteen, doesn’t matter.

00:20:43.902 --> 00:20:48.818
Just allow yourself to be drifted with
the flow of Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:49.019 --> 00:20:52.465
If it works out, well and good, if it does
not work out, well and good.

00:20:52.666 --> 00:20:54.609
Just keep it like that.

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:59.821
Then only you will be surprised how
this Mahalakshmi Power improves,

00:21:00.022 --> 00:21:03.876
and the blessings of this power are
tremendous.

00:21:05.508 --> 00:21:09.118
Like that you have thousand and one powers
already awakened within you.

00:21:09.319 --> 00:21:14.171
For example on Vishuddhi Chakra, you have
sixteen thousand powers,

00:21:16.983 --> 00:21:22.831
and all these sixteen [thousand] powers
are awakened in you, today as you are.

00:21:23.032 --> 00:21:28.185
Sixteen thousand powers are awakened
in you as you are today.

00:21:28.386 --> 00:21:32.795
But when you speak you don’t understand

00:21:32.996 --> 00:21:35.885
that when you are speaking you are
a sahaja yogi,

00:21:36.086 --> 00:21:38.954
with all these powers you are speaking.

00:21:39.633 --> 00:21:43.759
When you eat you don’t understand
that this tongue

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:48.050
belongs to a sahaja yogi; you should not
hanker after anything.

00:21:48.251 --> 00:21:54.791
Like if somebody likes tea, he’ll go on
taking fifteen cups. That’s no good.

00:21:54.992 --> 00:21:59.907
If he is fond of one sort of a food,
he won’t take another food.

00:22:02.865 --> 00:22:06.065
Thinking too much about food all the time,

00:22:06.266 --> 00:22:11.766
asking for food and organizing food
all the time,

00:22:11.967 --> 00:22:16.544
that spoils Vishuddhi very badly.

00:22:16.746 --> 00:22:20.161
Then talking ill about anyone, complaining
about anyone to Me,

00:22:20.362 --> 00:22:24.087
will spoil your Vishuddhi.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.464
If there’s some sense, if I ask, then
is alright,

00:22:26.665 --> 00:22:33.421
but all the time talking ill about each
other will spoil your Vishuddhi.

00:22:33.663 --> 00:22:38.904
If possible, try to talk good about others
- always.

00:22:39.129 --> 00:22:42.572
By telling good about another person,

00:22:43.256 --> 00:22:46.378
you will help yourself and another person.
For example say,

00:22:46.579 --> 00:22:52.983
one Mr. X comes and tells Me something
against Mr. Y – I’m just stunned,

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:59.987
because Mr. Y has come and already
told Me that Mr. X is a fine man.

00:23:00.188 --> 00:23:03.825
So I tell Mr. X, “How do you say that
about Mr. Y,

00:23:04.026 --> 00:23:08.727
because he was praising you?” So he
keeps absolutely

00:23:08.928 --> 00:23:14.209
in a shocked condition and he doesn’t
know how to answer.

00:23:16.343 --> 00:23:22.150
When you judge others, you should know
that you are judged by God.

00:23:22.351 --> 00:23:30.023
If you are judging others, God has judged
you also. So in His judgment

00:23:31.807 --> 00:23:36.409
whatever marks you give to yourself
and to others are not going to be

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:43.695
consulted at all. It is His judgment which
is going to decide how far you are.

00:23:43.895 --> 00:23:47.877
Those who are in Sahaj Yoga today,

00:23:48.078 --> 00:23:53.355
there may be some who think that they are
great sahaj yogis, big people -

00:23:53.556 --> 00:23:59.934
but may be that they are not. And those
who do not

00:24:00.135 --> 00:24:06.909
think that they are any great, they want
to increase and improve their shakti,

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:12.949
they may be the people who are occupying
very high places.

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:16.999
So, under these circumstances one should
never boast

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:22.141
and should not have a wrong, false
estimation about oneself.

00:24:22.342 --> 00:24:29.199
That is the way you can preserve your
powers much better of your Vishuddhi.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.393
If you start talking ill about others
to each other -

00:24:32.594 --> 00:24:35.848
also I’ve seen people start discussing Me,

00:24:36.049 --> 00:24:40.956
and in a very funny way they do it.
I think the best way

00:24:41.157 --> 00:24:47.316
to deal with the problem is not to speak
about Me, and if you have to speak,

00:24:47.517 --> 00:24:51.157
then know that it has to be absolutely
positive.

00:24:51.358 --> 00:24:54.619
Otherwise you are harming yourself
and you are harming others.

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:57.090
Then you don’t blame Me for that.

00:24:57.291 --> 00:25:01.142
So that’s how your Vishuddhi Chakra’s
problems are increasing,

00:25:01.343 --> 00:25:06.566
and they go on increasing. Specially when
you try to confuse yourself

00:25:06.767 --> 00:25:11.271
and quarrel with yourself and think that,
you see, Sahaj Yoga

00:25:11.472 --> 00:25:16.641
has gained by your coming - you catch
Vishuddhi.

00:25:16.842 --> 00:25:20.135
You have gained, not Sahaj Yoga.

00:25:21.175 --> 00:25:26.891
Sahaj Yog is ruled by itself, it doesn’t
need your help.

00:25:27.092 --> 00:25:31.769
If there is Truth, then by accepting Truth
you are enhanced,

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:36.207
your position has gone up, not the position
of the Truth.

00:25:36.408 --> 00:25:39.348
So this idea from your head must go
right away –

00:25:39.549 --> 00:25:43.596
that you have any way obliged the Sahaj
Yoga,

00:25:43.797 --> 00:25:47.181
or that you have obliged God by coming
to Him.

00:25:47.387 --> 00:25:52.629
This idea must go down. This will
definitely make your head again

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:57.788
upside-down, and your Kundalini will be
again back to its own position.

00:25:57.989 --> 00:26:06.416
So to keep up even your Vishuddhi alright
is not easy, according to many.

00:26:06.617 --> 00:26:13.208
But is the easiest when you keep
yourselves in a state of witness.

00:26:13.409 --> 00:26:17.802
And that is possible if you develop
the habit after Realisation

00:26:18.003 --> 00:26:25.172
that everything that you do or want
or face is put into nirvicharita,

00:26:25.373 --> 00:26:29.345
into thoughtless awareness. If you start
that habit,

00:26:29.546 --> 00:26:33.049
you’ll be amazed – your witness state
will improve

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:37.336
and that you will rise in your being.

00:26:37.537 --> 00:26:40.194
This is very important to understand

00:26:40.395 --> 00:26:43.323
that without transformation, you have
no meaning.

00:26:43.554 --> 00:26:49.710
Whatever you have been, have been
useless, of no good.

00:26:49.911 --> 00:26:53.530
Whatever you are transformed, you are
of some use.

00:26:53.731 --> 00:26:56.980
So whatever you have been, you do not
be identified with that.

00:26:57.181 --> 00:27:00.386
But whatever you have to be, you’ll try
to be that.

00:27:00.587 --> 00:27:04.922
And this power you have got, that whatever
you want, you will be that.

00:27:05.123 --> 00:27:08.431
But some people are so funny that if you
ask them, “What do you want to be?”

00:27:08.632 --> 00:27:11.820
They’ll say that, “I want to be a donkey”.

00:27:13.426 --> 00:27:17.483
All such silly and foolish people are
no good for Sahaj Yog,

00:27:17.684 --> 00:27:22.461
once for all you must know. No use
running after such foolish people

00:27:22.676 --> 00:27:28.613
who have no sense at all, and who are such
gone cases. They’ll come back, afterwards.

00:27:28.814 --> 00:27:33.574
But put your attention on positivity
and not on negativity.

00:27:33.775 --> 00:27:37.781
Normally I’ve seen always negative people
turn towards the negative people.

00:27:37.982 --> 00:27:41.801
If there’s one negative person standing,
a person who is negative

00:27:42.002 --> 00:27:46.083
will immediately go and talk to that
person, find out about that person,

00:27:46.308 --> 00:27:49.978
he’ll have sympathy for that person;
he’ll like that person;

00:27:50.179 --> 00:27:54.232
all sorts of things will be there. And
first sign is that such a person

00:27:54.433 --> 00:27:59.854
is a complete negatively possessed being.

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:05.086
Alright. Now if you have done that kind
of a thing, of being possessed

00:28:05.287 --> 00:28:11.488
or by getting impressed by these negative
people, you are out.

00:28:11.689 --> 00:28:15.411
Either you are in the sea or out of it.
How can you both?

00:28:15.612 --> 00:28:18.133
You’d better get out from there and spare
the rest.

00:28:18.334 --> 00:28:23.839
But if you want to be in the sea, then you
must know that you have to know swimming,

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.897
and you have to take pride in swimming.

00:28:27.098 --> 00:28:31.081
Otherwise it has no meaning, it is
of no help.

00:28:31.282 --> 00:28:35.540
Now you have got curative power, you know
that; you can cure people.

00:28:35.741 --> 00:28:41.255
But do not get into that mess, because
there Mahamaya plays Her part!

00:28:41.456 --> 00:28:46.213
If you – if I find that you are getting
into your head the idea

00:28:46.414 --> 00:28:56.781
that you are very much - very much getting
involved into particular case

00:28:56.982 --> 00:29:05.534
of your brother-in-law’s, father-in-law’s,
mother-in-law, then I’ll stop it,

00:29:06.392 --> 00:29:10.859
or you get into trouble. If you start
making money out of it, I’ll stop it.

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:14.327
I’ll do many things by which I’ll just
stop it.

00:29:14.528 --> 00:29:20.092
And then you cannot have that power in you.

00:29:20.293 --> 00:29:23.349
On the contrary, you’ll suffer quite a lot,
because

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:27.203
you do not know how to protect yourself
from all these bad things.

00:29:27.404 --> 00:29:31.515
So, I have to request you that before
starting curing others,

00:29:31.716 --> 00:29:33.677
you first cure yourself fully,

00:29:33.878 --> 00:29:37.689
and also you can use My photographs
for curing other people.

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:42.530
But you must know that there is a very
subtle thing in human beings

00:29:42.762 --> 00:29:45.980
that they want that everybody should
say, “Oh, you are great,

00:29:46.181 --> 00:29:48.767
you have cured so many people!” -

00:29:49.719 --> 00:29:52.938
in a very subtle way, on a very subtle
basis.

00:29:53.363 --> 00:29:56.867
So, one should not bother about all
these things.

00:29:57.068 --> 00:30:00.270
One should keep completely detached
about it.

00:30:00.471 --> 00:30:03.981
Because for one day or two days, or for
say about a year,

00:30:04.182 --> 00:30:08.215
people will run to you, “Get this man
cured, that man cured.”

00:30:08.416 --> 00:30:12.514
And then you’ll find that you have found
nothing, they were all bubbles,

00:30:12.715 --> 00:30:16.944
all lost and completely vanished into
thin air.

00:30:17.145 --> 00:30:22.317
So, do not cure anyone. If you have
to cure people,

00:30:22.518 --> 00:30:26.813
then you please give them the photograph
and ask them to work on them.

00:30:27.014 --> 00:30:30.828
You have got power to handle My photograph
and give it to others.

00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:34.347
You have lots of powers which normally
common people don’t have

00:30:34.548 --> 00:30:38.671
because I do not tell them many things
that I tell you.

00:30:38.872 --> 00:30:44.875
And thus you are a person of a very rare
quality

00:30:45.076 --> 00:30:49.613
and a rare blessing.

00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:53.992
Now write it down how many powers you
have got, go home,

00:30:54.193 --> 00:31:00.711
and you will write a one complete book!
Take it from Me. May God bless you all.

00:31:00.912 --> 00:31:03.880
Try to preserve all your powers.
Respect yourself.

00:31:04.081 --> 00:31:12.296
You are a lamp that is burning a light
which enlightens others in their mind.

00:31:12.497 --> 00:31:20.495
It’s a very great thing: even one person
like that was born

00:31:20.696 --> 00:31:26.050
among millions and billions of people,
and now here we have so many of you.

00:31:26.251 --> 00:31:31.372
But quality-wise if you don’t rise,
it’s going to be a hopeless case.

00:31:31.573 --> 00:31:36.349
So you must improve your quality.
All of you must improve your quality,

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:39.555
individually. Not criticising others,

00:31:39.756 --> 00:31:43.923
not looking at others, but individually
you should understand

00:31:44.124 --> 00:31:49.600
your capacities and how much you have
given to others,

00:31:49.805 --> 00:31:56.069
and how much you have really manifested
out of what you have got.

00:31:57.243 --> 00:32:00.250
You have control over the sun,
over the moon,

00:32:00.451 --> 00:32:05.344
over the tides, and over the sea and all
those things – you have.

00:32:05.544 --> 00:32:10.156
But for that, you have to do little more,
which I’ll tell you some other time.

00:32:10.357 --> 00:32:12.759
Now I don’t want you to control all
these things,

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:17.353
and sit down on top of a hillock and start
showing off!

00:32:17.554 --> 00:32:20.550
Better thing is you work it out first
on human beings,

00:32:20.751 --> 00:32:24.588
and then I’ll give you all these - I’ll
tell you. You already have them awakened,

00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:27.300
but I haven’t told you the trick how
to do it.

00:32:27.501 --> 00:32:30.789
So best keep it to Myself.

00:32:34.381 --> 00:32:36.722
May God bless you all.
