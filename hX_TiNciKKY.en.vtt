WEBVTT

00:04.299 --> 00:07.719
First of all we should know what powers
we have got,

00:07.920 --> 00:11.606
and also we should know how we are going
to preserve those powers

00:11.807 --> 00:17.780
and what more powers we can very - very
easily achieve.

00:46.940 --> 00:52.129
The first power that you get after
Realisation

00:52.330 --> 00:57.026
is the greatest power on Earth.

00:57.365 --> 01:00.708
This is the power of Shri Ganesha.

01:04.337 --> 01:11.254
It is only He can do this job that you
people are doing today,

01:11.455 --> 01:16.486
and that power is of raising the Kundalini.

01:19.288 --> 01:25.542
No one so far in the history
of spirituality

01:25.743 --> 01:32.060
has ever raised the Kundalini in such
a short time as you people are doing.

01:32.261 --> 01:37.928
It moves under your fingers; it is
absolutely Shri Ganesha’s power

01:38.129 --> 01:40.869
which is given to you.

01:44.247 --> 01:49.934
At the time when you are giving
the Realisation,

01:51.788 --> 01:59.230
even if you are caught up in any one
of your chakras,

01:59.431 --> 02:04.576
or you have any problem, even if you are
little bit possessed,

02:04.777 --> 02:11.221
even if you are not such a good sahaj yogi,

02:11.422 --> 02:15.655
even if you are not that much surrendered
to Mataji,

02:15.856 --> 02:24.958
even if you don’t have much sense
of obligation about Sahaj Yoga,

02:25.161 --> 02:30.201
still the Kundalini rises under your
fingers.

02:31.677 --> 02:37.501
This Ganesh Shakti is given to you
by Shri Ganesh Himself within you;

02:37.702 --> 02:41.014
to give you the confidence,

02:41.215 --> 02:45.017
to give you the confidence that
you can raise the Kundalini,

02:45.218 --> 02:55.746
but not the feeling that you are raising
the Kundalini.

02:56.385 --> 03:02.334
If you go on without surrendering yourself
to Sahaj Yoga,

03:02.535 --> 03:07.285
after some time you will lose this power,
very fast.

03:09.606 --> 03:13.235
The another power which you have got

03:13.436 --> 03:18.765
- at the raising of the Kundalini
of anyone,

03:19.064 --> 03:26.989
you can notice it that, when the Kundalini
rises, that time

03:27.578 --> 03:31.871
there will be no obstruction of any kind.

03:33.642 --> 03:36.618
Whatever may be the obstructions around

03:36.819 --> 03:40.427
– say there’s a possessed person next door,

03:40.628 --> 03:45.409
he would not disturb you at that time.

03:45.610 --> 03:49.272
In your family there may be a person
who is a negative person,

03:49.457 --> 03:55.778
but if you are raising the Kundalini,
at that moment he will be kept quiet.

03:56.456 --> 03:59.256
At the time when you are moving
your hand on the Kundalini,

03:59.457 --> 04:03.059
is the greatest power you are using.

04:03.259 --> 04:05.298
I don’t know how much shraddha you have

04:05.499 --> 04:08.948
about yourself and about the power that
you have.

04:09.150 --> 04:14.153
At that time there will be no obstruction

04:14.354 --> 04:17.531
on your hand by anyone whatsoever!

04:17.732 --> 04:25.770
Even by mistake, nobody will hold
your hand or touch your hand.

04:33.574 --> 04:44.375
The second power you have got when
you are raising the Kundalini, that,

04:47.101 --> 04:52.151
at that time when you’ll be raising
your Kundalini,

04:53.013 --> 04:59.727
you will be completely attracting
the attention of the another person within,

05:02.798 --> 05:05.460
like a magnet,

05:08.403 --> 05:12.315
by which you should understand that
you can raise your Kundalini

05:12.516 --> 05:16.134
whenever you feel like. When you
are raising the Kundalini, supposing

05:16.335 --> 05:19.370
there’s lot of noise going on,

05:20.607 --> 05:25.624
there are all kinds of problems going on –
supposing you are going in the train,

05:25.825 --> 05:31.446
there’s a noise of the train, or any
such thing happening –

05:32.088 --> 05:38.782
that time your attention will not be
distracted,

05:38.983 --> 05:46.405
but the attention of the person who is
taking the Realisation from you

05:46.606 --> 05:51.003
will not be attracted by outside things

05:51.204 --> 05:54.192
at that time when you are raising
the Kundalini.

05:54.393 --> 05:57.903
Or - that means that you can give
Realisation at any time,

05:58.104 --> 06:05.380
because at that time you reside
in the lotus which is closed.

06:11.878 --> 06:16.173
The other power you have got,

06:17.782 --> 06:22.418
at the time of Kundalini jagruti
(awakening),

06:22.619 --> 06:30.697
that no baser feelings will rise within
you.

06:31.808 --> 06:36.528
Even if you are a possessed person,
at the time of Kundalini jagruti

06:36.729 --> 06:40.606
you will not have baser feelings, impure
feelings

06:40.807 --> 06:44.697
about the person whom you are giving
Realisation.

06:44.898 --> 06:49.729
Maybe before and after, but not during,
when you are giving Realisation,

06:49.930 --> 06:52.993
these dirty feelings will not come to you.

06:53.194 --> 06:59.355
Automatically, you don’t have to stop
your mind, automatically it will work out.

06:59.809 --> 07:03.502
You will be absolutely satisfied, even
if you are hungry

07:03.703 --> 07:08.002
you will not feel the hunger or any
physical need,

07:08.203 --> 07:11.627
at the time when you are giving
Realisation.

07:11.828 --> 07:17.331
There will be no distraction of any kind;
you won’t do anything

07:17.532 --> 07:26.586
that is indignified at the time when
you will be raising your hand, because

07:29.038 --> 07:34.717
you are been blessed with dignity.

07:35.060 --> 07:39.596
At the time when you are raising
the Kundalini, you will never joke,

07:39.797 --> 07:43.376
or you’ll never make fun, you’ll not be
frivolous – automatically!

07:43.577 --> 07:49.313
You try: it won’t work out.

07:53.413 --> 07:57.753
These are your supporting powers.

07:57.954 --> 08:03.716
All these five powers I have described
are very few

08:04.417 --> 08:11.083
of the thousands others, but these are
the five powers of Shri Ganesh.

08:19.057 --> 08:24.762
Now, these powers can be maintained

08:26.210 --> 08:31.902
if you try to follow Shri Ganesh.

08:32.511 --> 08:39.486
His foremost quality is that He does not
know any other God or anybody else

08:39.687 --> 08:42.923
higher than His own Mother.

08:43.131 --> 08:47.749
A complete dedication and complete
obedience to Mother.

08:47.950 --> 08:52.824
I mean, sort of He is made out
of that obedience.

08:54.980 --> 08:59.165
Complete love and affection for the Mother.

08:59.564 --> 09:03.572
He doesn’t argue, He doesn’t question,
He doesn’t do anything,

09:03.773 --> 09:08.626
and that’s how these powers are, in Him,
the maximum.

09:08.981 --> 09:15.112
If you think by arguing with Me you are
gaining, you are sadly mistaken.

09:16.324 --> 09:24.754
You have to keep Me pleased. Even Ganesha
tries every minute to keep Me pleased.

09:26.848 --> 09:33.584
Is a fact. So, please don’t try
to displease Me.

09:33.786 --> 09:41.030
I may not say anything because outwardly
I don’t say anything,

09:41.231 --> 09:44.857
but your powers will be reduced.

09:50.613 --> 09:59.267
The Ganesha’s fifth power is the power
of wisdom

09:59.468 --> 10:06.246
and that whatever He knows He can
draw it and write it down.

10:08.083 --> 10:12.356
Even that power you have got.

10:12.557 --> 10:19.617
When you are raising the Kundalini, you
talk to the person in such a manner

10:19.818 --> 10:25.719
that a person becomes wise.

10:26.357 --> 10:33.076
And you also talk to him only that
which is wisdom

10:33.740 --> 10:41.488
and also you write or show him figures,
automatically which are right.

10:42.760 --> 10:47.742
Even if you don’t remember your figures,
they’ll come out right.

10:53.026 --> 10:58.966
Now the three powers of Adi Shakti work
in you.

11:00.098 --> 11:03.320
One gives you longevity

11:07.227 --> 11:11.868
and clear-cut idea about your desires.

11:16.112 --> 11:19.499
See, if your desires are right,

11:20.465 --> 11:25.873
all your desires are fulfilled by this
power – all your desires, all!

11:26.920 --> 11:31.016
But the first one, one should know,
that your desires should be right.

11:31.217 --> 11:35.256
For example, now sahaja yogis want
their ashram.

11:36.710 --> 11:39.962
Why do they want ashram for?

11:41.747 --> 11:45.371
How many are willing to stay in the ashram?

11:48.066 --> 11:53.267
How many are going to take their children
in the ashram?

11:55.499 --> 12:01.128
How many are going to give their exclusive
homes and take their wives

12:01.329 --> 12:07.609
or take their husbands who are not
sahaja yogis in the ashram?

12:07.810 --> 12:10.503
And how many of them are wanting only
ashram

12:10.704 --> 12:15.256
just because they will have some
place to live in a cheap manner?

12:16.428 --> 12:20.526
What is the purpose of getting ashram?

12:21.455 --> 12:28.301
Are you sure about it? Have you been able
to find out why do you want an ashram?

12:29.238 --> 12:32.705
If your desires are clear-cut

12:34.728 --> 12:41.528
then they will be fulfilled, absolutely
hundred percent.

12:43.141 --> 12:48.349
That power you can achieve only by putting
your bandhan on your heart.

12:48.550 --> 12:52.295
Whatever desire you have, you say it
and put it on your heart.

12:52.496 --> 12:57.788
Means you are asking from your heart.
Seven times, you just give it a bandhan,

12:57.989 --> 13:00.458
and the work will be done.

13:02.373 --> 13:05.953
But don’t use it for nonsensical things,

13:06.154 --> 13:11.663
because if you use it for nonsensical
things, this power will go away.

13:13.007 --> 13:18.525
Use for something special, of a higher
level.

13:21.744 --> 13:25.772
Now, by your second power

13:26.544 --> 13:33.907
you will automatically meet people who are
learned and who are sahaja.

13:34.479 --> 13:39.255
You will also read books which are sahaja.

13:40.390 --> 13:44.440
Even if you have to read some other books,
you will be able to know

13:44.641 --> 13:48.199
that this is not correct and this is
correct.

13:52.390 --> 13:58.641
And by that you will be enriching your
mind.

13:59.400 --> 14:02.879
When you will start speaking, people will
be amazed.

14:03.080 --> 14:05.863
Those who have never spoken would be
speaking very well.

14:06.064 --> 14:10.328
Those who have never known poetry will be
writing poetry.

14:13.129 --> 14:16.598
Lots of things will happen on the field
of art also.

14:16.799 --> 14:21.842
Those who did not know art will do
marvelously in art.

14:24.394 --> 14:32.000
But by the first power, which is the Adi
Shakti’s power, or Mahakali’s power,

14:32.490 --> 14:38.634
you get the love of all the people around.

14:40.214 --> 14:45.040
Everybody will feel magnetically attracted
towards you.

14:46.765 --> 14:56.890
And you will be always guided by great
souls and angels.

14:59.104 --> 15:02.876
If you come across anybody who is meeting
an accident,

15:03.077 --> 15:06.615
you will stop that man from going that way.

15:06.816 --> 15:10.320
If you are in an accident, everybody
will be saved.

15:10.521 --> 15:15.844
You will seldom have an accident - if you
have it, you won’t be hurt much. Amazing!

15:16.045 --> 15:21.877
All these powers come to you because
you are the children of Adi Shakti.

15:22.078 --> 15:30.778
The whole Universe of the subtle,
Divine Power

15:30.979 --> 15:36.010
is looking after you individually. You are
all marked,

15:36.211 --> 15:43.713
the mark is on you, you are bearing
the mark, and They are looking after you.

15:51.566 --> 16:00.628
So this power of desiring is the power
that protects you.

16:01.890 --> 16:07.263
In all the way that is possible it guides
you,

16:08.411 --> 16:13.133
it looks after you, it gives you peace.

16:19.098 --> 16:27.304
And this power gives you tremendous faith
in Sahaj Yoga.

16:30.824 --> 16:35.861
Ultimately you become filled with the joy
of Sahaj Yoga,

16:36.062 --> 16:43.034
and you don’t like anything else but Sahaj
Yoga. To you, everything is Sahaja Yoga.

16:43.235 --> 16:45.608
But sometimes, you know, we are identified
with our ego

16:45.809 --> 16:49.217
and we think our ego is Sahaj Yog,
many-a-times I have seen it.

16:49.418 --> 16:52.531
People like it because it is identified
with their ego.

16:52.732 --> 16:59.994
It should be separated from that and should
be brought in our lives.

17:00.195 --> 17:02.402
In our day-to-day life,

17:02.571 --> 17:04.907
when we are meeting each other,
when we are talking to each other,

17:05.108 --> 17:09.913
that joy one should see, one ripple falling

17:10.114 --> 17:13.933
and another rising, another falling,
as you see in the sea.

17:14.134 --> 17:19.425
Becoming one with each other.
This power is within you

17:20.227 --> 17:26.227
and it is working all the time that you
are loved and you are looked after.

17:26.821 --> 17:31.434
By the middle power, I have told you,
you’ll give Realization to people.

17:31.635 --> 17:33.797
You’ll be able to tell their chakras.

17:33.998 --> 17:40.086
You’ll be able to correct your chakras.
This is all by your centre power.

17:40.287 --> 17:43.759
And by this power only you have

17:43.960 --> 17:47.128
a very great power over your will.

17:47.329 --> 17:52.790
If you decide that you are going to be
like this, you will be.

17:53.942 --> 17:57.699
If you want to be a happy person you
will be.

17:57.901 --> 18:02.937
The transformation will be at your hand.

18:03.138 --> 18:08.044
You can transform yourself without
any difficulty,

18:08.246 --> 18:18.296
that will work out, if you use the central
power of Mahalakshmi.

18:19.931 --> 18:23.896
Of course, you will get better jobs,

18:24.097 --> 18:27.792
better money, prospects, but not too much
of it.

18:27.993 --> 18:32.175
So much so, that you will feel very much
satisfied about it,

18:32.376 --> 18:36.311
so that your attention is more
in the centre.

18:36.762 --> 18:42.352
All other powers of Mahalakshmi you will
achieve later on.

18:45.630 --> 18:49.670
There are many other powers of Mahalakshmi
which you have to achieve,

18:49.870 --> 18:53.340
but for that your Sushumna has to be
cleaned very much.

18:53.541 --> 18:56.732
For that, you have to develop detachment
in life.

18:56.933 --> 19:04.559
Unless and until you develop detachment,
the deeper powers of

19:06.290 --> 19:11.752
Mahalakshmi do not come up. For example,
even in the smaller things,

19:11.953 --> 19:19.244
like having connection with Me,

19:20.160 --> 19:24.005
even that one is to be a detached thing.

19:24.206 --> 19:32.485
Even to say Aarti or to do something,
to come forward, that, “I have to do it.”

19:32.686 --> 19:38.049
Even to invite Me for dinner or this thing,

19:38.250 --> 19:43.206
every small thing, that “I should do it,”
is also attachment.

19:43.407 --> 19:46.325
If it works out, well and good; if it does
not work out, well and good.

19:46.526 --> 19:50.005
You must say that, “Mother, You come.”
But if I cannot come,

19:50.206 --> 19:53.367
there should not be slightest feeling
and unhappiness,

19:53.568 --> 19:56.146
but should be accepted as a part of that.

19:56.347 --> 20:00.444
This detachment has to be developed
for your Mahalakshmi Power.

20:00.645 --> 20:03.361
Then you go beyond.

20:08.902 --> 20:13.400
Your timing will be worked out absolutely
correctly –

20:13.601 --> 20:16.316
you wouldn’t need – you wouldn’t have
to see the time.

20:16.517 --> 20:20.197
There will be time which will be your own.

20:20.398 --> 20:24.678
Whenever you will go, you’ll find
everything worked out well.

20:24.879 --> 20:30.673
So, to preserve this power of time,
you must not hurry-up too much,

20:30.874 --> 20:33.941
you should not be slaves of watches.

20:34.691 --> 20:40.232
Just let it go. Do not have any obstinacy
about anything. Just doesn’t matter:

20:40.433 --> 20:43.701
if it is ten o’clock, alright; if not,
if ten fifteen, doesn’t matter.

20:43.902 --> 20:48.818
Just allow yourself to be drifted with
the flow of Sahaja Yoga.

20:49.019 --> 20:52.465
If it works out, well and good, if it does
not work out, well and good.

20:52.666 --> 20:54.609
Just keep it like that.

20:54.810 --> 20:59.821
Then only you will be surprised how
this Mahalakshmi Power improves,

21:00.022 --> 21:03.876
and the blessings of this power are
tremendous.

21:05.508 --> 21:09.118
Like that you have thousand and one powers
already awakened within you.

21:09.319 --> 21:14.171
For example on Vishuddhi Chakra, you have
sixteen thousand powers,

21:16.983 --> 21:22.831
and all these sixteen [thousand] powers
are awakened in you, today as you are.

21:23.032 --> 21:28.185
Sixteen thousand powers are awakened
in you as you are today.

21:28.386 --> 21:32.795
But when you speak you don’t understand

21:32.996 --> 21:35.885
that when you are speaking you are
a sahaja yogi,

21:36.086 --> 21:38.954
with all these powers you are speaking.

21:39.633 --> 21:43.759
When you eat you don’t understand
that this tongue

21:43.990 --> 21:48.050
belongs to a sahaja yogi; you should not
hanker after anything.

21:48.251 --> 21:54.791
Like if somebody likes tea, he’ll go on
taking fifteen cups. That’s no good.

21:54.992 --> 21:59.907
If he is fond of one sort of a food,
he won’t take another food.

22:02.865 --> 22:06.065
Thinking too much about food all the time,

22:06.266 --> 22:11.766
asking for food and organizing food
all the time,

22:11.967 --> 22:16.544
that spoils Vishuddhi very badly.

22:16.746 --> 22:20.161
Then talking ill about anyone, complaining
about anyone to Me,

22:20.362 --> 22:24.087
will spoil your Vishuddhi.

22:24.320 --> 22:26.464
If there’s some sense, if I ask, then
is alright,

22:26.665 --> 22:33.421
but all the time talking ill about each
other will spoil your Vishuddhi.

22:33.663 --> 22:38.904
If possible, try to talk good about others
- always.

22:39.129 --> 22:42.572
By telling good about another person,

22:43.256 --> 22:46.378
you will help yourself and another person.
For example say,

22:46.579 --> 22:52.983
one Mr. X comes and tells Me something
against Mr. Y – I’m just stunned,

22:53.190 --> 22:59.987
because Mr. Y has come and already
told Me that Mr. X is a fine man.

23:00.188 --> 23:03.825
So I tell Mr. X, “How do you say that
about Mr. Y,

23:04.026 --> 23:08.727
because he was praising you?” So he
keeps absolutely

23:08.928 --> 23:14.209
in a shocked condition and he doesn’t
know how to answer.

23:16.343 --> 23:22.150
When you judge others, you should know
that you are judged by God.

23:22.351 --> 23:30.023
If you are judging others, God has judged
you also. So in His judgment

23:31.807 --> 23:36.409
whatever marks you give to yourself
and to others are not going to be

23:36.610 --> 23:43.695
consulted at all. It is His judgment which
is going to decide how far you are.

23:43.895 --> 23:47.877
Those who are in Sahaj Yoga today,

23:48.078 --> 23:53.355
there may be some who think that they are
great sahaj yogis, big people -

23:53.556 --> 23:59.934
but may be that they are not. And those
who do not

24:00.135 --> 24:06.909
think that they are any great, they want
to increase and improve their shakti,

24:07.110 --> 24:12.949
they may be the people who are occupying
very high places.

24:13.150 --> 24:16.999
So, under these circumstances one should
never boast

24:17.200 --> 24:22.141
and should not have a wrong, false
estimation about oneself.

24:22.342 --> 24:29.199
That is the way you can preserve your
powers much better of your Vishuddhi.

24:29.400 --> 24:32.393
If you start talking ill about others
to each other -

24:32.594 --> 24:35.848
also I’ve seen people start discussing Me,

24:36.049 --> 24:40.956
and in a very funny way they do it.
I think the best way

24:41.157 --> 24:47.316
to deal with the problem is not to speak
about Me, and if you have to speak,

24:47.517 --> 24:51.157
then know that it has to be absolutely
positive.

24:51.358 --> 24:54.619
Otherwise you are harming yourself
and you are harming others.

24:54.820 --> 24:57.090
Then you don’t blame Me for that.

24:57.291 --> 25:01.142
So that’s how your Vishuddhi Chakra’s
problems are increasing,

25:01.343 --> 25:06.566
and they go on increasing. Specially when
you try to confuse yourself

25:06.767 --> 25:11.271
and quarrel with yourself and think that,
you see, Sahaj Yoga

25:11.472 --> 25:16.641
has gained by your coming - you catch
Vishuddhi.

25:16.842 --> 25:20.135
You have gained, not Sahaj Yoga.

25:21.175 --> 25:26.891
Sahaj Yog is ruled by itself, it doesn’t
need your help.

25:27.092 --> 25:31.769
If there is Truth, then by accepting Truth
you are enhanced,

25:31.970 --> 25:36.207
your position has gone up, not the position
of the Truth.

25:36.408 --> 25:39.348
So this idea from your head must go
right away –

25:39.549 --> 25:43.596
that you have any way obliged the Sahaj
Yoga,

25:43.797 --> 25:47.181
or that you have obliged God by coming
to Him.

25:47.387 --> 25:52.629
This idea must go down. This will
definitely make your head again

25:52.830 --> 25:57.788
upside-down, and your Kundalini will be
again back to its own position.

25:57.989 --> 26:06.416
So to keep up even your Vishuddhi alright
is not easy, according to many.

26:06.617 --> 26:13.208
But is the easiest when you keep
yourselves in a state of witness.

26:13.409 --> 26:17.802
And that is possible if you develop
the habit after Realisation

26:18.003 --> 26:25.172
that everything that you do or want
or face is put into nirvicharita,

26:25.373 --> 26:29.345
into thoughtless awareness. If you start
that habit,

26:29.546 --> 26:33.049
you’ll be amazed – your witness state
will improve

26:33.250 --> 26:37.336
and that you will rise in your being.

26:37.537 --> 26:40.194
This is very important to understand

26:40.395 --> 26:43.323
that without transformation, you have
no meaning.

26:43.554 --> 26:49.710
Whatever you have been, have been
useless, of no good.

26:49.911 --> 26:53.530
Whatever you are transformed, you are
of some use.

26:53.731 --> 26:56.980
So whatever you have been, you do not
be identified with that.

26:57.181 --> 27:00.386
But whatever you have to be, you’ll try
to be that.

27:00.587 --> 27:04.922
And this power you have got, that whatever
you want, you will be that.

27:05.123 --> 27:08.431
But some people are so funny that if you
ask them, “What do you want to be?”

27:08.632 --> 27:11.820
They’ll say that, “I want to be a donkey”.

27:13.426 --> 27:17.483
All such silly and foolish people are
no good for Sahaj Yog,

27:17.684 --> 27:22.461
once for all you must know. No use
running after such foolish people

27:22.676 --> 27:28.613
who have no sense at all, and who are such
gone cases. They’ll come back, afterwards.

27:28.814 --> 27:33.574
But put your attention on positivity
and not on negativity.

27:33.775 --> 27:37.781
Normally I’ve seen always negative people
turn towards the negative people.

27:37.982 --> 27:41.801
If there’s one negative person standing,
a person who is negative

27:42.002 --> 27:46.083
will immediately go and talk to that
person, find out about that person,

27:46.308 --> 27:49.978
he’ll have sympathy for that person;
he’ll like that person;

27:50.179 --> 27:54.232
all sorts of things will be there. And
first sign is that such a person

27:54.433 --> 27:59.854
is a complete negatively possessed being.

28:00.070 --> 28:05.086
Alright. Now if you have done that kind
of a thing, of being possessed

28:05.287 --> 28:11.488
or by getting impressed by these negative
people, you are out.

28:11.689 --> 28:15.411
Either you are in the sea or out of it.
How can you both?

28:15.612 --> 28:18.133
You’d better get out from there and spare
the rest.

28:18.334 --> 28:23.839
But if you want to be in the sea, then you
must know that you have to know swimming,

28:24.040 --> 28:26.897
and you have to take pride in swimming.

28:27.098 --> 28:31.081
Otherwise it has no meaning, it is
of no help.

28:31.282 --> 28:35.540
Now you have got curative power, you know
that; you can cure people.

28:35.741 --> 28:41.255
But do not get into that mess, because
there Mahamaya plays Her part!

28:41.456 --> 28:46.213
If you – if I find that you are getting
into your head the idea

28:46.414 --> 28:56.781
that you are very much - very much getting
involved into particular case

28:56.982 --> 29:05.534
of your brother-in-law’s, father-in-law’s,
mother-in-law, then I’ll stop it,

29:06.392 --> 29:10.859
or you get into trouble. If you start
making money out of it, I’ll stop it.

29:11.060 --> 29:14.327
I’ll do many things by which I’ll just
stop it.

29:14.528 --> 29:20.092
And then you cannot have that power in you.

29:20.293 --> 29:23.349
On the contrary, you’ll suffer quite a lot,
because

29:23.550 --> 29:27.203
you do not know how to protect yourself
from all these bad things.

29:27.404 --> 29:31.515
So, I have to request you that before
starting curing others,

29:31.716 --> 29:33.677
you first cure yourself fully,

29:33.878 --> 29:37.689
and also you can use My photographs
for curing other people.

29:37.890 --> 29:42.530
But you must know that there is a very
subtle thing in human beings

29:42.762 --> 29:45.980
that they want that everybody should
say, “Oh, you are great,

29:46.181 --> 29:48.767
you have cured so many people!” -

29:49.719 --> 29:52.938
in a very subtle way, on a very subtle
basis.

29:53.363 --> 29:56.867
So, one should not bother about all
these things.

29:57.068 --> 30:00.270
One should keep completely detached
about it.

30:00.471 --> 30:03.981
Because for one day or two days, or for
say about a year,

30:04.182 --> 30:08.215
people will run to you, “Get this man
cured, that man cured.”

30:08.416 --> 30:12.514
And then you’ll find that you have found
nothing, they were all bubbles,

30:12.715 --> 30:16.944
all lost and completely vanished into
thin air.

30:17.145 --> 30:22.317
So, do not cure anyone. If you have
to cure people,

30:22.518 --> 30:26.813
then you please give them the photograph
and ask them to work on them.

30:27.014 --> 30:30.828
You have got power to handle My photograph
and give it to others.

30:31.029 --> 30:34.347
You have lots of powers which normally
common people don’t have

30:34.548 --> 30:38.671
because I do not tell them many things
that I tell you.

30:38.872 --> 30:44.875
And thus you are a person of a very rare
quality

30:45.076 --> 30:49.613
and a rare blessing.

30:50.149 --> 30:53.992
Now write it down how many powers you
have got, go home,

30:54.193 --> 31:00.711
and you will write a one complete book!
Take it from Me. May God bless you all.

31:00.912 --> 31:03.880
Try to preserve all your powers.
Respect yourself.

31:04.081 --> 31:12.296
You are a lamp that is burning a light
which enlightens others in their mind.

31:12.497 --> 31:20.495
It’s a very great thing: even one person
like that was born

31:20.696 --> 31:26.050
among millions and billions of people,
and now here we have so many of you.

31:26.251 --> 31:31.372
But quality-wise if you don’t rise,
it’s going to be a hopeless case.

31:31.573 --> 31:36.349
So you must improve your quality.
All of you must improve your quality,

31:36.550 --> 31:39.555
individually. Not criticising others,

31:39.756 --> 31:43.923
not looking at others, but individually
you should understand

31:44.124 --> 31:49.600
your capacities and how much you have
given to others,

31:49.805 --> 31:56.069
and how much you have really manifested
out of what you have got.

31:57.243 --> 32:00.250
You have control over the sun,
over the moon,

32:00.451 --> 32:05.344
over the tides, and over the sea and all
those things – you have.

32:05.544 --> 32:10.156
But for that, you have to do little more,
which I’ll tell you some other time.

32:10.357 --> 32:12.759
Now I don’t want you to control all
these things,

32:12.960 --> 32:17.353
and sit down on top of a hillock and start
showing off!

32:17.554 --> 32:20.550
Better thing is you work it out first
on human beings,

32:20.751 --> 32:24.588
and then I’ll give you all these - I’ll
tell you. You already have them awakened,

32:24.789 --> 32:27.300
but I haven’t told you the trick how
to do it.

32:27.501 --> 32:30.789
So best keep it to Myself.

32:34.381 --> 32:36.722
May God bless you all.
