00:00:00.658 --> 00:00:09.278
1992-10-17 Public Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

00:00:10.224 --> 00:00:14.950
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:29.748
At the very outset, we have to know that truth is what it is.

00:00:30.865 --> 00:00:43.362
We cannot transform it, change it, and even think about it;

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:54.139
unfortunately at this human awareness, we cannot even feel it.

00:00:55.406 --> 00:00:58.668
You have been already told about the subtle system

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:03.252
we have within ourselves.

00:01:03.975 --> 00:01:10.569
This subtle system works out your ascent.

00:01:11.883 --> 00:01:18.164
Whatever I am telling you today you need not accept blindfold.

00:01:18.374 --> 00:01:24.258
But if it is proved, treat it as a hypothesis

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:31.942
and if it is true then you have to accept it as honestly.

00:01:32.143 --> 00:01:37.628
Because it is for the benevolence of you

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.135
and for the benevolence of your country

00:01:41.336 --> 00:01:46.248
and for the benevolence of this world.

00:01:46.449 --> 00:01:52.451
It is the last breakthrough of our evolution into a new awareness

00:01:52.652 --> 00:01:57.488
that we become the Spirit.

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:04.434
The first thing you should know that we are not this body,

00:02:04.635 --> 00:02:08.960
this mind, this ego, these conditionings,

00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:14.235
but we are the pure Spirit.

00:02:16.975 --> 00:02:23.483
And the another truth is that
there is this all pervading power

00:02:23.684 --> 00:02:27.799
of divine love

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.429
which does all the living work.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.658
You see these beautiful flowers, its a miracle.

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:47.146
And you see your own eyes,

00:02:47.347 --> 00:02:51.511
what a camera!

00:02:52.176 --> 00:02:56.716
And this brain, what a computer.

00:02:56.917 --> 00:03:01.038
But we take everything for granted.

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.648
If you ask doctor who runs our heart

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.053
he will say it’s a autonomous nervous system.

00:03:09.254 --> 00:03:14.059
But who is this auto?

00:03:14.853 --> 00:03:19.223
There is a power, which is a living power,

00:03:19.424 --> 00:03:24.360
which does all this living work.

00:03:25.494 --> 00:03:29.849
This is the power of divine love

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:37.123
and this love is the truth.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.791
The first thing is to become the Spirit,

00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:52.426
and the second is to feel,

00:03:52.627 --> 00:03:59.305
to feel the all pervading power of divine love.

00:03:59.506 --> 00:04:03.694
This is not just a lecture

00:04:03.895 --> 00:04:06.407
- or a sermon... - Sorry?

00:04:06.608 --> 00:04:09.623
or a sermon.

00:04:09.824 --> 00:04:20.863
But it is to tell you that you all have your divinity intact.

00:04:21.064 --> 00:04:26.779
Your divinity cannot be destroyed.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.046
It cannot be tarnished.

00:04:31.247 --> 00:04:38.667
Whatever you might have done, your divinity is eternal.

00:04:38.868 --> 00:04:46.078
So the question is only how to manifest that divinity.

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:52.384
When this power, which you call as Kundalini, rises,

00:04:52.585 --> 00:04:54.900
she passes through six centres,

00:04:55.101 --> 00:04:58.417
ultimately breaks through the seventh centre

00:04:58.618 --> 00:05:03.078
which we call as the fontanelle bone area.

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:11.310
So this the actualization of your baptism.

00:05:11.511 --> 00:05:15.819
It is not the false certificate.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:26.662
This power, kundalini power, is the reflection of the holy ghost.

00:05:26.863 --> 00:05:31.629
Holy ghost is no more a mystery.

00:05:33.838 --> 00:05:37.505
When we talk about the God almighty,

00:05:37.706 --> 00:05:45.657
and about the son, then what about the mother?

00:05:48.077 --> 00:05:53.590
Mother is a dove, is the holy ghost.

00:05:53.791 --> 00:05:57.783
It is (inaudible), is the primordial mother,

00:05:57.984 --> 00:06:02.094
which is the holy ghost.

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:06.064
In Greece she is called as Athena

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:11.983
and in India it is called as the Adi Shakti.

00:06:12.645 --> 00:06:20.897
In Gospel of Thomas, Thomas has written that Christ said that

00:06:21.098 --> 00:06:24.015
"this is the mother who conceived me.

00:06:24.216 --> 00:06:28.283
But I have one Great Mother,

00:06:28.484 --> 00:06:34.241
and when she is with the father, I am also with her."

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.598
So there was a primordial mother.

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:47.916
But there is no prayer in the bible also,

00:06:48.117 --> 00:06:52.987
there is no praise of the Mother of Christ.

00:06:53.188 --> 00:07:01.513
They did not even say that she was a Goddess

00:07:01.714 --> 00:07:06.037
or she was Madonna.

00:07:06.238 --> 00:07:10.768
It was the Pagan religion which was before Christianity

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:16.281
which influenced people and this formerly religion.

00:07:16.796 --> 00:07:18.830
It seems Paul hated women

00:07:19.031 --> 00:07:24.740
and he did not want their place in the bible at all.

00:07:24.977 --> 00:07:28.840
And he does not, also now they don’t permit women

00:07:29.041 --> 00:07:33.850
to have the position of priest.

00:07:34.051 --> 00:07:37.820
But not in the in the Indian Scriptures,

00:07:38.021 --> 00:07:46.422
Primordial Mother is reflected as kundalini in us.

00:07:46.623 --> 00:07:53.072
And the God almighty is reflected in our heart as Spirit.

00:07:53.273 --> 00:07:59.448
Now when this kundalini rises, you will be amazed to see

00:07:59.649 --> 00:08:04.777
that she automatically cures

00:08:04.978 --> 00:08:12.014
your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being.

00:08:12.215 --> 00:08:16.813
It’s a fact that many diseases have been cured.

00:08:17.014 --> 00:08:19.259
There are three doctors in India,

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:24.602
who have now got MD in Sahaja Yoga,

00:08:24.803 --> 00:08:30.853
for curing incurable diseases.

00:08:31.054 --> 00:08:35.175
So when this kundalini is traveling through the centres,

00:08:35.376 --> 00:08:39.392
she nourishes them, she integrates them

00:08:39.593 --> 00:08:44.827
and she connects you to this all pervading power.

00:08:46.231 --> 00:08:51.848
First of all you feel absolutely peaceful

00:08:52.049 --> 00:08:57.660
because when she passes through your this (Agnya) centre,

00:08:57.861 --> 00:09:08.259
she breaks the thoughts and between the thought, there is a pause.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.697
Your mind is jumping on the cusp of thoughts,

00:09:11.898 --> 00:09:16.160
coming from the past or present.

00:09:22.409 --> 00:09:29.475
So, when the kundalini rises

00:09:29.676 --> 00:09:34.658
then these thoughts from the past and the future separate

00:09:34.859 --> 00:09:41.141
and between there is a pause, that is the present.

00:09:41.342 --> 00:09:50.344
And in the present you don’t think, there is no thought.

00:09:50.545 --> 00:09:56.817
So you receive your peaceful status.

00:09:57.018 --> 00:10:03.005
You are aware, fully aware but you are thoughtless.

00:10:03.206 --> 00:10:05.389
If you want to think, you can think,

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:11.090
if you don’t want to think you can be at peace with yourself.

00:10:14.902 --> 00:10:19.831
The second stage where this connection with all pervading power

00:10:20.032 --> 00:10:24.078
is fully established, then you receive another awareness

00:10:24.279 --> 00:10:29.076
which you call as doubtless awareness.

00:10:29.588 --> 00:10:36.989
In that state, in that state, you become powerful enough

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:41.323
to give realization to others.

00:10:41.944 --> 00:10:45.252
You can cure others.

00:10:45.453 --> 00:10:49.547
And your personality emits peace.

00:10:51.646 --> 00:10:55.094
The nature of Spirit

00:10:55.295 --> 00:11:01.063
which once come into your attention

00:11:01.264 --> 00:11:05.654
enlightens the attention.

00:11:07.211 --> 00:11:11.605
When the attention is enlightened,

00:11:11.806 --> 00:11:16.415
then your attention becomes active.

00:11:17.788 --> 00:11:24.250
And the attention which is enlightened,

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:36.851
can activate in another person this benevolence.

00:11:40.229 --> 00:11:45.216
This attention becomes innocent.

00:11:45.417 --> 00:11:52.366
Christ has said, thou shall not have adulterous eyes.

00:11:52.567 --> 00:11:59.068
How many Christian have eyes which are innocent?

00:11:59.269 --> 00:12:04.341
Devoid of lust and greed?

00:12:04.542 --> 00:12:16.152
But only after your self realization your eyes start sparkling,

00:12:16.353 --> 00:12:21.441
and they become absolutely innocent.

00:12:21.642 --> 00:12:23.895
And they become so powerful

00:12:24.096 --> 00:12:28.076
that even a glance of such a person

00:12:28.277 --> 00:12:33.522
can do so much good to another one.

00:12:35.577 --> 00:12:45.245
The second great point about Spirit is that it is a universal being.

00:12:45.446 --> 00:12:49.762
In a way, we are universal also.

00:12:49.963 --> 00:12:53.737
If you cut here (any finger) of anyone,

00:12:53.938 --> 00:12:57.780
you will find the same nerve, the same artery,

00:12:57.981 --> 00:13:02.378
the same vessel, the same blood.

00:13:02.579 --> 00:13:07.738
So our differences is only skin deep.

00:13:07.939 --> 00:13:11.124
But Spirit mean the universal being.

00:13:11.325 --> 00:13:18.465
When it comes into your attention, you become an universal being.

00:13:18.666 --> 00:13:25.857
Then automatically you transcend all barriers, of caste,

00:13:26.058 --> 00:13:34.203
of religion, of country, races; everything automatically.

00:13:34.404 --> 00:13:38.769
Sahaja yoga is working in 55 nations

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:43.752
and we have thousands and thousands of sahaja yogis.

00:13:43.953 --> 00:13:48.296
They come to India for a seminar,

00:13:48.497 --> 00:13:54.692
I have never seen them fighting,
quarreling

00:13:54.893 --> 00:13:59.195
on any point whatsoever.

00:13:59.396 --> 00:14:08.037
Because Spirit is the source of the absolute truth.

00:14:09.021 --> 00:14:14.265
We live on a relative world.

00:14:15.148 --> 00:14:18.923
There are so many dogmas,

00:14:19.124 --> 00:14:22.493
there are so many theories,

00:14:22.694 --> 00:14:26.506
so many ideas,

00:14:26.707 --> 00:14:36.797
but once you become the Spirit, all of you see the same thing.

00:14:37.407 --> 00:14:45.230
Supposing you have ten people, children, whose eyes are tied,

00:14:45.431 --> 00:14:51.599
and you ask them who is this man? What is he suffering from?

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:56.768
They will all raise one finger, say like this.

00:14:56.969 --> 00:14:59.500
Then you ask that man, are you suffering

00:14:59.701 --> 00:15:03.537
from some heart trouble?

00:15:03.738 --> 00:15:07.942
He said "yes, but how do you know?".

00:15:08.143 --> 00:15:15.565
Because this finger decodes heart trouble.

00:15:15.766 --> 00:15:21.234
So on your fingertips you will know the truth.

00:15:21.435 --> 00:15:26.259
These days there are many false gurus, prophets,

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:30.645
coming also from India.

00:15:31.032 --> 00:15:40.239
They are only money oriented or power oriented.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:45.059
They can show some sort of a miracle of giving you

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:50.111
a Swiss watch or something like that

00:15:50.312 --> 00:15:54.453
or some rich people diamonds also.

00:15:55.443 --> 00:15:58.313
Those who believe in such things

00:15:58.514 --> 00:16:04.286
cannot believe in God almighty.

00:16:04.487 --> 00:16:10.580
Because for God all these things are dust.

00:16:10.781 --> 00:16:15.195
He doesn’t understand money.

00:16:15.443 --> 00:16:21.853
Even the religions have become power oriented or money oriented.

00:16:22.054 --> 00:16:27.738
They are not Spirit oriented, as they should be.

00:16:27.939 --> 00:16:32.432
This is the reason why we have deviated

00:16:32.633 --> 00:16:38.373
from the real religion which was started.

00:16:38.574 --> 00:16:45.280
All religions were started by real people.

00:16:45.481 --> 00:16:51.425
They were like flowers on the same tree of life.

00:16:51.626 --> 00:16:55.020
But we plucked it

00:16:55.221 --> 00:17:01.270
and now we are fighting with dead flowers.

00:17:01.471 --> 00:17:07.298
How can you fight in the name of God?

00:17:07.605 --> 00:17:12.761
It is illogical.

00:17:13.706 --> 00:17:22.363
So the Spirit is the source of all the knowledge,

00:17:22.564 --> 00:17:27.396
which is pure knowledge.

00:17:30.115 --> 00:17:35.116
All whatever I am saying is absolutely tangible,

00:17:35.317 --> 00:17:39.394
can be proved,

00:17:39.595 --> 00:17:48.142
can be tested. It is scientific, but it is a meta-science.

00:17:48.373 --> 00:17:51.054
Meta-science.

00:17:51.255 --> 00:17:58.903
Because the science is a knowledge,
say, of the tree that has grown out,

00:17:59.104 --> 00:18:03.018
but this is the knowledge of the roots.

00:18:03.219 --> 00:18:06.222
And if you know the knowledge of the roots,

00:18:06.423 --> 00:18:10.814
it’s very simple and fundamental.

00:18:11.015 --> 00:18:20.130
Above all, Spirit is the source of joy.

00:18:20.331 --> 00:18:26.081
It does not have the duality of happiness and unhappiness.

00:18:26.282 --> 00:18:30.586
It is a singular thing

00:18:30.787 --> 00:18:36.875
which you can enjoy but cannot describe.

00:18:37.076 --> 00:18:42.230
All this divinity is within you, all of you;

00:18:42.431 --> 00:18:47.167
and nothing is lost.

00:18:47.368 --> 00:18:51.751
You have to just understand that

00:18:51.952 --> 00:18:58.225
you all can get your Self-Realization tonight.

00:19:00.649 --> 00:19:04.434
First of all, I have to tell you that

00:19:04.635 --> 00:19:10.611
I cannot force self knowledge on you.

00:19:11.314 --> 00:19:15.648
You'll become a collective being,

00:19:15.849 --> 00:19:20.240
by which you know the problems of others.

00:19:20.441 --> 00:19:24.936
And you should know that most of the problems of this world

00:19:25.137 --> 00:19:29.010
are because of human beings.

00:19:29.211 --> 00:19:35.198
And most of the human problems are because of these centres.

00:19:35.399 --> 00:19:39.442
Now if you have centres put right,

00:19:39.643 --> 00:19:43.362
then all the problems are solved.

00:19:43.563 --> 00:19:47.746
There cannot be any war,

00:19:47.947 --> 00:19:52.745
there cannot be any quarrel about anything.

00:19:52.946 --> 00:19:59.956
Also when you are blessed by this all pervading power,

00:20:00.157 --> 00:20:04.355
you have many other powers also.

00:20:04.556 --> 00:20:14.948
Like the agriculture, your country can prosper ten times more.

00:20:15.149 --> 00:20:18.257
All living process is expedited.

00:20:18.458 --> 00:20:19.512
Sorry, Sheri Mataji.

00:20:19.713 --> 00:20:24.088
All living process will be expedited.

00:20:24.289 --> 00:20:28.109
All this sounds very fantastic.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:31.735
But you are fantastic.

00:20:31.936 --> 00:20:38.446
Because you are not yet connected, you don’t know what you are.

00:20:38.647 --> 00:20:41.171
As this (mike) instrument when it is not connected,

00:20:41.372 --> 00:20:44.936
it has no meaning.

00:20:45.137 --> 00:20:49.642
So this connection is to be established.

00:20:49.843 --> 00:20:54.315
Again I would say those who do not want to have Self-Realization

00:20:54.516 --> 00:20:58.785
should leave the hall because it cannot be forced.

00:20:58.986 --> 00:21:03.135
I respect your freedom.

00:21:03.336 --> 00:21:08.951
Christ has said, the meek in heart will inherit the earth.

00:21:09.152 --> 00:21:14.353
So sahaja yoga is not meant for arrogant people,

00:21:14.554 --> 00:21:21.614
nor it is meant for stupid people and idiotic people.

00:21:21.815 --> 00:21:29.260
It is meant for people who really desire to have the higher life.

00:21:29.461 --> 00:21:34.613
You have to have a very pure desire.

00:21:36.185 --> 00:21:38.289
So again I would request you

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:41.626
those who do not want to have their Self-Realization,

00:21:41.827 --> 00:21:45.997
should leave the hall.

00:21:46.198 --> 00:21:50.237
It will hardly take ten minutes.

00:21:50.854 --> 00:21:54.323
It will hardly take ten minutes.

00:21:55.512 --> 00:22:00.170
Please sit down, please be seated all of you.

00:22:18.492 --> 00:22:21.659
I am very happy to see there are so many seekers

00:22:21.867 --> 00:22:27.047
of truth in Rio de Janeiro.

00:22:27.299 --> 00:22:31.068
I have been traveling South America

00:22:31.268 --> 00:22:36.700
and this is the last program I have.

00:22:38.501 --> 00:22:45.938
And everywhere there are one thousand of
people who have got their realization.

00:22:46.377 --> 00:22:50.512
First thing you don’t have to pay for it.

00:22:50.713 --> 00:22:54.130
It is invaluable.

00:22:54.346 --> 00:23:01.813
And I have told you that God does not understand money or banking.

00:23:02.496 --> 00:23:08.287
So today when you have your realization,

00:23:08.488 --> 00:23:14.652
please remember that this is the collective happening.

00:23:15.325 --> 00:23:20.857
You have to come to our collective centre

00:23:21.058 --> 00:23:27.363
so that this connection is properly established.

00:23:27.982 --> 00:23:35.099
You don’t have to fast, or suffer, or go to Himalayas.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:39.659
Christ has already suffered for us.

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:44.040
Are you going to suffer more than he has suffered?

00:23:44.241 --> 00:23:50.204
So all these theories of suffering is all nonsense.

00:23:50.405 --> 00:24:00.145
In short you should be very pleasantly placed to yourself.

00:24:00.877 --> 00:24:07.623
Because you are human beings, epitome of evolution.

00:24:07.824 --> 00:24:16.066
And a little more journey you are going to be in the kingdom of God.

00:24:18.015 --> 00:24:22.577
Now there are three very simple conditions.

00:24:22.778 --> 00:24:29.719
The first on is that you have to be fully self-confident

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:34.811
that you will get your realization.

00:24:36.562 --> 00:24:41.257
Full-confident.

00:24:41.458 --> 00:24:48.098
It follows them that don't condemn yourself for anything.

00:24:48.299 --> 00:24:54.297
It follows that don't condemn yourself or anything.

00:24:54.498 --> 00:25:00.591
You are not to feel guilty at all for anything.

00:25:00.792 --> 00:25:04.019
After all, you have done committed mistakes,

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:08.697
you are human beings, you are not God.

00:25:08.898 --> 00:25:13.875
And this All-Pervading Power is the ocean of forgiveness

00:25:14.125 --> 00:25:17.929
and whatever mistakes you might have committed

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:22.639
it dissolves everything.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:28.074
So please don't feel guilty because the center of the left hand side here,

00:25:28.275 --> 00:25:33.384
this one, gets ruining by feeling guilty.

00:25:33.585 --> 00:25:37.761
Even physically you suffer.

00:25:37.962 --> 00:25:46.258
Either you get angina or spondylitis or many heart problems.

00:25:46.459 --> 00:25:49.840
So what is the need to feel guilty?

00:25:50.041 --> 00:25:54.855
Why should you punish yourself for nothing at all?

00:25:55.056 --> 00:26:02.074
So just now please please tell yourself: "I am not guilty at all".

00:26:03.162 --> 00:26:09.006
Now, the second condition is that -

00:26:09.207 --> 00:26:13.288
this is the second one I said, don't feel guilty, the third one

00:26:13.489 --> 00:26:19.686
is that you have to forgive everyone.

00:26:19.936 --> 00:26:23.330
Now, they say it is very difficult,

00:26:23.531 --> 00:26:30.640
but logically whether you forgive or don't forgive, what do you do?

00:26:30.841 --> 00:26:33.793
You don't do anything.

00:26:33.994 --> 00:26:38.434
But when you don't forgive you play into wrong hands

00:26:38.635 --> 00:26:45.508
those who have harmed you
are happy people.

00:26:45.709 --> 00:26:51.920
And those people like you

00:26:52.121 --> 00:26:57.290
who are suffering are playing into their hands.

00:26:58.634 --> 00:27:03.219
But at this time specially, the center of the Agnya, this one,

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:07.680
the optic chiasma is like this, closed.

00:27:07.881 --> 00:27:11.201
Now, if you have to open this, you have to forgive,

00:27:11.402 --> 00:27:15.690
otherwise it will be like this, constricted.

00:27:15.891 --> 00:27:18.711
It won't open.

00:27:18.912 --> 00:27:22.724
As it is, you have tortured yourself all your life,

00:27:22.925 --> 00:27:27.958
and now if you don't forgive, this will not open

00:27:28.159 --> 00:27:34.617
and you will miss this great opportunity of getting self-realization.

00:27:34.818 --> 00:27:39.786
So when you forgive, it opens like this.

00:27:39.987 --> 00:27:43.543
So don't even think about those people.

00:27:43.744 --> 00:27:46.833
It is a headache.

00:27:47.034 --> 00:27:52.723
In general, you should say: "I forgive everyone".

00:27:52.924 --> 00:27:55.814
That is the best way

00:27:56.015 --> 00:27:59.737
that you will get your self-realization.

00:27:59.938 --> 00:28:03.031
You have to seat very comfortably,

00:28:03.232 --> 00:28:06.898
not in any asana or anything, in a very simple way,

00:28:07.099 --> 00:28:09.835
without any tension.

00:28:10.036 --> 00:28:15.557
[Shri Mataji talks to a man that is sitting in a funny way]

00:28:17.429 --> 00:28:23.903
You have to just take out your shoes because this Mother Earth helps us a lot.

00:28:33.389 --> 00:28:35.461
And relax.

00:28:35.662 --> 00:28:38.445
No tension.

00:28:38.646 --> 00:28:42.854
You have to seat comfortably in your chair.

00:28:43.055 --> 00:28:47.820
Sitting on your chair, you will get your Realization.

00:28:48.021 --> 00:28:50.880
Now you have to put both feet apart each other,

00:28:51.081 --> 00:28:54.268
those who are sitting on the chairs,

00:28:54.469 --> 00:28:59.591
otherwise who are sitting on the ground are perfectly alright.

00:28:59.792 --> 00:29:08.731
Sitting in a sanyasi, say, in a sanya sanasi, you say, called it, without any a...

00:29:11.638 --> 00:29:15.590
Relax, relax your legs.

00:29:15.994 --> 00:29:18.742
It is not the right way.

00:29:18.965 --> 00:29:23.973
Tell him, tell him, relax, relax fully.

00:29:30.952 --> 00:29:33.149
Spread out, spread out.

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:35.415
Now both the feet are away from each other.

00:29:35.616 --> 00:29:38.240
No, no, it is alright.

00:29:38.441 --> 00:29:42.118
On the ground, you can also seat like this, it is alright.

00:29:42.319 --> 00:29:47.137
Not necessary for you, you can, this gentleman, no the another one.

00:29:47.338 --> 00:29:53.350
Yes, sit comfortably, be comfortable.

00:30:01.149 --> 00:30:06.323
Now first thing, we will show you.

00:30:06.524 --> 00:30:13.816
We will show you how you will nourish your own centers.

00:30:21.617 --> 00:30:25.851
Please just focus it and then you have to close your eyes.

00:30:26.052 --> 00:30:30.021
First you have to put your left hand on your lap,

00:30:30.222 --> 00:30:35.243
left hand on your left lap comfortably.

00:30:35.444 --> 00:30:40.326
Please put both your legs apart from each others.

00:30:41.802 --> 00:30:49.076
Now, please remember this left hand suggests

00:30:49.277 --> 00:30:54.608
your desire to have your self-realization.

00:30:54.809 --> 00:30:58.121
Now, the right hand, you are going to use it

00:30:58.322 --> 00:31:02.926
to nourish our centers on the left hand side.

00:31:03.127 --> 00:31:08.762
So we put our right hand on our heart first.

00:31:08.963 --> 00:31:12.535
In the heart resides the Spirit,

00:31:12.736 --> 00:31:17.540
which is the reflexion of God Almighty.

00:31:18.475 --> 00:31:24.876
Now, if you become the Spirit, you become your own master.

00:31:25.077 --> 00:31:32.314
So now, you take your right hand in upper portion of your abdomen

00:31:32.515 --> 00:31:36.632
on the left hand side.

00:31:37.415 --> 00:31:42.638
This is the center of your mastery.

00:31:42.839 --> 00:31:47.100
Later all you will know everything about it.

00:31:47.309 --> 00:31:51.678
You don't have to pay for that knowledge.

00:31:51.879 --> 00:31:54.848
Now you put your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen

00:31:55.049 --> 00:31:58.166
on the left hand side.

00:31:58.367 --> 00:32:04.711
This is the center of Pure Divine Knowledge.

00:32:05.276 --> 00:32:13.159
Now, raise your hand again back onto the

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:17.954
upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

00:32:20.433 --> 00:32:26.737
Now, raise your right hand on the heart.

00:32:26.938 --> 00:32:28.938
Now you have to take your right hand

00:32:29.139 --> 00:32:33.625
in the corner of your neck and your shoulder.

00:32:33.833 --> 00:32:37.545
And turn your head to your right.

00:32:37.746 --> 00:32:42.543
I've already told you what happens

00:32:42.744 --> 00:32:46.863
when this center is out of gear.

00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:53.887
Now please, take your right hand on top of your forehead across

00:32:54.088 --> 00:32:57.845
and put down your head.

00:32:58.858 --> 00:33:05.390
This is the center where you have to forgive everyone in general.

00:33:05.591 --> 00:33:10.884
Now please take your right hand on the back side of your head.

00:33:11.085 --> 00:33:15.822
And push back your head as far as possible.

00:33:16.023 --> 00:33:22.624
Here without feeling guilty, without counting mistakes,

00:33:22.825 --> 00:33:29.232
you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power.

00:33:29.433 --> 00:33:35.162
Now the last center, just watch,

00:33:35.363 --> 00:33:39.791
Stretch your palm fully.

00:33:39.992 --> 00:33:45.523
Now put the center of your palm on top of fontanelle bone area

00:33:45.724 --> 00:33:53.117
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

00:33:53.318 --> 00:33:58.078
Now please put down your head as far as you can.

00:33:58.279 --> 00:34:05.425
Now the important thing is to stretch down your fingers as far as possible.

00:34:05.643 --> 00:34:10.527
So that there is a good pressure on your scalp.

00:34:10.728 --> 00:34:15.111
Now please move

00:34:15.312 --> 00:34:21.630
your scalp slowly seven times clockwise.

00:34:21.831 --> 00:34:26.854
Please take down your hands.

00:34:30.611 --> 00:34:35.509
That is all we have to do.

00:34:43.797 --> 00:34:46.187
Now you all have to close your eyes

00:34:45.588 --> 00:34:50.043
and please don't open till I tell you.

00:34:55.407 --> 00:34:58.975
So put your left hand on your lap, left side

00:34:59.176 --> 00:35:03.761
and right hand on your heart, both feet apart.

00:35:10.572 --> 00:35:16.384
Here you have to ask Me a very fundamental question.

00:35:21.708 --> 00:35:26.106
Three times in your heart.

00:35:26.307 --> 00:35:31.041
You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji, whatever you like.

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:37.760
"Mother, Am I the Spirit?

00:35:37.961 --> 00:35:42.893
Ask this question three times in your heart.

00:35:55.808 --> 00:36:01.089
I've told you that if you become the Spirit,

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:05.569
you become your own master.

00:36:10.961 --> 00:36:13.018
So now, please take your right hand

00:36:13.219 --> 00:36:18.281
on the upper portion of your abdomen and press it hard.

00:36:22.738 --> 00:36:27.519
Here you have to ask another fundamental question.

00:36:29.668 --> 00:36:35.254
"Mother, am I my own master?"

00:37:02.957 --> 00:37:06.879
I have to again tell you that I cannot force

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:14.289
the Pure Divine Knowledge on you, you have to ask for it.

00:37:21.935 --> 00:37:25.537
So please take your right hand

00:37:25.738 --> 00:37:30.370
in the lower portion of your abdomen

00:37:34.363 --> 00:37:41.768
and here you have to ask six times because this center has got six petals.

00:37:46.982 --> 00:37:56.318
Please ask six times: "Mother, please give me Pure Divine Knowledge".

00:38:06.805 --> 00:38:14.071
As soon as you ask for the Divine Knowledge

00:38:14.272 --> 00:38:19.084
the Kundalini starts rising.

00:38:25.809 --> 00:38:32.629
So we have to nourish our upper centers with our full self-confidence.

00:38:38.712 --> 00:38:40.712
So now please raise your right hand

00:38:40.913 --> 00:38:44.056
in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

00:38:44.257 --> 00:38:48.616
and press it hard.

00:38:51.163 --> 00:39:00.727
Now here you have to say with full confidence ten times:

00:39:00.928 --> 00:39:05.657
"Mother, I am my own master".

00:39:26.468 --> 00:39:30.311
I've already told you that the fundamental fact about you

00:39:30.512 --> 00:39:36.020
is that you are not this body, this mind, this ego, these conditionings,

00:39:36.221 --> 00:39:40.446
but you are the pure Spirit.

00:39:50.886 --> 00:39:58.838
So now please leave your right hand onto your heart

00:40:00.698 --> 00:40:07.221
and here with full confidence, please say twelve times:

00:40:07.422 --> 00:40:13.570
"Mother, I am the pure Spirit".

00:40:27.706 --> 00:40:32.924
This All-Pervading Power of Divine Love

00:40:33.125 --> 00:40:38.046
is the ocean of knowledge.

00:40:42.475 --> 00:40:50.300
It is the ocean of compassion and peace.

00:40:52.869 --> 00:40:56.996
It is a ocean of miracles

00:40:57.204 --> 00:41:02.212
But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

00:41:03.752 --> 00:41:07.830
Whatever mistakes you might have commuted can be easily dissolve

00:41:08.031 --> 00:41:13.913
by the power of this ocean of compassion.

00:41:24.287 --> 00:41:29.953
So please forgive yourself and raise your right hand in the corner

00:41:30.154 --> 00:41:36.426
of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right.

00:41:44.515 --> 00:41:54.432
Here you have to say with full confidence sixteen times:

00:41:54.633 --> 00:42:00.407
"Mother, I am not guilty at all".

00:42:30.218 --> 00:42:36.703
I've already told you that whether you forgive or you don't forgive

00:42:36.904 --> 00:42:41.408
you don't do anything.

00:42:44.532 --> 00:42:49.220
But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

00:42:52.227 --> 00:42:55.133
Specially at this time if you don't forgive,

00:42:55.334 --> 00:43:00.375
this constricted Agnya Chakra won't open.

00:43:05.612 --> 00:43:10.401
So I request you that please raise your right hand

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:15.760
on top of your forehead and put down your head.

00:43:22.117 --> 00:43:26.828
And I have to request you to say from your heart not how many times:

00:43:27.029 --> 00:43:32.599
"Mother, I forgive everyone in general".

00:43:55.821 --> 00:43:58.923
Now take your right hand on the back side of your head

00:43:59.124 --> 00:44:03.969
and push back your head as far as possible.

00:44:12.056 --> 00:44:15.423
Here without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

00:44:15.624 --> 00:44:20.743
just for your satisfaction, you have to say:

00:44:31.893 --> 00:44:41.408
"Mother, oh Divine, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me".

00:44:53.713 --> 00:44:57.489
Just for your satisfaction, you have to say from your heart,

00:44:57.690 --> 00:45:02.037
not how many times.

00:45:10.006 --> 00:45:14.466
Now the last center.

00:45:15.006 --> 00:45:20.060
Please stretch your hand fully.

00:45:24.639 --> 00:45:32.810
And put the center of your palm on the fontanelle bone area.

00:45:37.118 --> 00:45:44.375
Please put down your head and remember to stretch back your fingers.

00:45:48.673 --> 00:45:54.907
Here again I cannot force Self-Realization on you,

00:45:55.108 --> 00:45:59.149
you have to ask for it.

00:46:03.806 --> 00:46:09.607
So move your scalp seven times clockwise saying:

00:46:09.808 --> 00:46:15.599
"Mother, please give me Self-Realization".

00:46:56.561 --> 00:47:01.068
Now please take down your hand.

00:47:03.905 --> 00:47:09.068
And open your eyes please, put on your glasses.

00:47:12.116 --> 00:47:18.357
Now please put both the hands like this towards Me.

00:47:22.922 --> 00:47:28.351
Now put right hand like this, bend your head

00:47:28.552 --> 00:47:36.596
and see with your left hand if there is a warm or hot or a cool breeze

00:47:36.813 --> 00:47:43.625
like waves coming out of your fontanelle bone area, bend your head.

00:48:00.901 --> 00:48:07.675
Now please don't doubt, put the left hand towards Me.

00:48:11.073 --> 00:48:14.346
And bend your head again and see with your right hand

00:48:14.555 --> 00:48:21.875
if there is a cool breeze coming out your head, may be warm or hot.

00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:35.848
Some people get it close to their head and some away.

00:48:41.309 --> 00:48:47.402
If it is hot that means you have not forgiven, so please forgive.

00:48:53.880 --> 00:49:01.692
Now, please put again your right hand towards Me.

00:49:04.573 --> 00:49:08.728
And put down your head.

00:49:08.929 --> 00:49:14.389
And see with the left hand again.

00:49:23.995 --> 00:49:29.800
Don't put hand on your head, away from.

00:49:36.193 --> 00:49:40.810
Now, please put both the hands towards Me like this.

00:49:43.553 --> 00:49:48.771
And just don't think, you can do it.

00:49:56.589 --> 00:50:04.366
Now all those who have felt hot, warm or cool breeze

00:50:04.567 --> 00:50:11.772
on the fingertips or on the palm or out of fontanelle bone area,

00:50:11.973 --> 00:50:16.426
please raise both your hands.

00:50:30.386 --> 00:50:36.799
All of you have got it. This is Rio de Janeiro. May God bless you.

00:50:41.733 --> 00:50:46.874
Such spiritual people here.

00:50:47.593 --> 00:50:50.491
This is the All-Pervading Power.

00:50:50.692 --> 00:50:56.496
Now you can put up your hands and ask a question.

00:51:01.122 --> 00:51:05.911
Ask anyone of these questions three times.

00:51:08.138 --> 00:51:12.872
"Mother, is this the Cool Breeze of the Holly Ghost?"

00:51:16.372 --> 00:51:23.989
"Mother, is this the All-Pervading Divine Power?"

00:51:27.318 --> 00:51:31.677
Or "Mother, is this the Paramchaitania?"

00:51:31.878 --> 00:51:37.042
Ask anyone of these questions three times.

00:51:44.565 --> 00:51:47.955
May God bless you.

00:51:48.164 --> 00:51:52.969
You can get more breeze when you ask such a question,

00:51:53.170 --> 00:51:57.187
because that is the truth.

00:52:02.923 --> 00:52:06.165
You ask the question: "Was Christ the Son of God?"

00:52:06.381 --> 00:52:10.217
Just put hands for it.

00:52:17.107 --> 00:52:21.325
You start getting much more.

00:52:21.974 --> 00:52:25.510
That is the truth.

00:52:25.742 --> 00:52:30.398
Now you can find about anyone.

00:52:32.446 --> 00:52:36.953
May God bless you all.

00:52:38.117 --> 00:52:44.907
I am going away tomorrow, I will come back after one year.

00:52:50.734 --> 00:52:55.680
I hope you all will come to the collective

00:52:55.881 --> 00:53:02.669
and learn everything about it and become masters.

00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:13.369
You can see you felt the cool breeze.

00:53:15.412 --> 00:53:20.920
And now you will find your life will be transforming.

00:53:24.428 --> 00:53:29.013
So please now enjoy yourself.

00:53:30.373 --> 00:53:35.349
But please come to the collective, that is very important.

00:53:38.139 --> 00:53:42.029
If a nail is cut, it doesn't grow,

00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:46.654
it has to be the part and parcel of the whole.

00:53:52.196 --> 00:53:57.954
You have brothers and sisters all of the world.

00:54:00.165 --> 00:54:04.657
I know one day all of us will be together.

00:54:07.337 --> 00:54:11.759
In any case, next year I will definitely come.

00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:15.993
Next year I will definitely come.

00:54:19.576 --> 00:54:25.357
If you have any questions, you can write to Me.

00:54:28.391 --> 00:54:32.672
Very nice meeting you together.

00:54:35.196 --> 00:54:40.336
Now please don't do guru shopping,

00:54:41.461 --> 00:54:46.117
because that is the proper disease.

00:54:47.423 --> 00:54:52.703
When we find water in one place, we dig the well there.

00:54:53.907 --> 00:54:58.281
When we find water in one place, we dig the well there.

00:55:03.101 --> 00:55:08.140
You don't go on digging all over.

00:55:10.234 --> 00:55:15.507
There is no marketing here.

00:55:17.789 --> 00:55:21.991
It is all open.

00:55:22.633 --> 00:55:26.695
And you all can have the complete knowledge about yourself

00:55:26.896 --> 00:55:30.679
and about others.

00:55:33.357 --> 00:55:38.208
This is how the whole world is going to change.

00:55:40.466 --> 00:55:46.013
And you are the people who are going to change the world.

00:55:48.568 --> 00:55:52.450
Thank you very much.

00:57:59.653 --> 00:58:01.848
Keep out all these horrible people.

00:58:02.049 --> 00:58:06.285
They are just out to make money. That’s all.

00:58:20.831 --> 00:58:25.049
He too was there and how much he suffered.

00:58:30.404 --> 00:58:34.185
It’s all money making.

00:58:42.657 --> 00:58:47.706
They just mesmerize. That’s why you start giving money, everything.

00:58:47.907 --> 00:58:53.774
People have perhaps sold their houses for these horrible gurus.

00:59:05.121 --> 00:59:09.108
There is no modus operandi that you should know that:

00:59:09.309 --> 00:59:13.606
"How, why, what is it?" You must know everything, isn’t it?

00:59:13.807 --> 00:59:17.072
If it is scientific, you should know what are the centers are,

00:59:17.273 --> 00:59:21.064
how they work out, how to cure them, how to do it,

00:59:21.265 --> 00:59:26.632
everything you should know. You just go on paying money to them.

00:59:37.004 --> 00:59:41.952
Everything should be tangible and logical.

00:59:44.624 --> 00:59:51.275
You will know everything, everything, about your self and about others.

00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:59.957
All these things, you should not be trying.

01:00:11.389 --> 01:00:15.789
If someone doesn’t feel the breeze very well, what should he do?

01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:17.990
It’s alright. You come and see them, you will feel it.

01:00:18.191 --> 01:00:23.247
There must be something wrong here (Vishuddhi).

01:00:27.318 --> 01:00:30.461
Doesn’t matter. Everybody will feel it.

01:00:30.662 --> 01:00:35.339
May be little here with cervical plexus, something wrong there.

01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:41.861
The cervical nerves may be little numb. That’s all. Everybody will feel it.

01:00:53.426 --> 01:01:02.984
Now the thing is that, if they say that you ascent,

01:01:03.185 --> 01:01:06.498
then you must have some powers.

01:01:06.699 --> 01:01:10.273
you must have some powers and you should know everything.

01:01:10.474 --> 01:01:15.064
You should have the full knowledge, how it works.

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:23.112
Don’t believe into anything that is blind.

01:01:44.532 --> 01:01:48.415
She says that she came late tonight, but she felt the breeze.

01:01:48.616 --> 01:01:52.795
And she can feel her chakras, her lower chakra on the right side

01:01:52.996 --> 01:01:55.707
paining, aching. She wants to know what does it mean.

01:01:55.908 --> 01:01:57.908
It’s alright. It will be cured.

01:01:58.109 --> 01:02:02.963
You must be very futuristic, thinking too much.

01:02:40.894 --> 01:02:44.894
The first time he meet you was in Brasilia in 89

01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:50.243
and now after meditation, he feels much much more. And he is so happy.

01:02:50.444 --> 01:02:53.650
Because you see, I have told you, it's a collective.

01:02:53.851 --> 01:02:56.822
If you are in the collective you grow very fast.

01:02:57.023 --> 01:02:59.848
So because you were left alone, that’s why.

01:03:00.049 --> 01:03:03.183
Now you be in the collective you will master it in no time.

01:03:03.384 --> 01:03:07.808
In 8 days these people mastered it.

01:03:15.811 --> 01:03:22.478
Overnight people have given up drugs, alcohol, everything nonsensical.

01:03:29.628 --> 01:03:35.975
Is there any problem to Sahaja Yoga to eating meat or drinking alcohol?

01:03:36.176 --> 01:03:41.200
You just give up whatever is not constructive, because of the light.

01:03:41.401 --> 01:03:43.833
You see the light, and in the light,

01:03:44.034 --> 01:03:46.418
you see what is the snake in your hand,

01:03:46.619 --> 01:03:50.800
you just throw it away yourself. I don’t say anything.

01:04:19.729 --> 01:04:23.010
You are blessed already (...)

01:04:23.211 --> 01:04:25.792
You will know how miracles are there.

01:04:25.993 --> 01:04:29.648
And what blessings you have got. Every moment is a blessing.

01:04:29.849 --> 01:04:36.028
You will be surprised because this, you know God is very efficient.

01:05:00.237 --> 01:05:05.694
While she put her head little back, she felt little round round.

01:05:05.895 --> 01:05:09.934
It’s alright. Might be you are having spondylitis. It’s curable.

01:05:30.598 --> 01:05:33.545
How can we learn to forgive?

01:05:33.746 --> 01:05:38.706
It’s nothing. Just say: "I forgive everyone". That’s all. Finished.

01:05:42.769 --> 01:05:46.956
Just say: "I forgive everyone".  Finished.

01:05:56.163 --> 01:06:00.086
It’s a very innocent question.
