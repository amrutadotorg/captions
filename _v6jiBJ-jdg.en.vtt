WEBVTT

00:13.612 --> 00:17.798
Brothers and Sisters of the World,

00:17.798 --> 00:25.880
It is a great honor for Me to talk about global
problems of women in front of this distinguished assembly.

00:25.880 --> 00:33.105
First of all, I would like to offer My profound
gratitude to the government and people of

00:33.105 --> 00:36.730
our host country, the People’s Republic
of China.

00:36.730 --> 00:42.635
I have had a privilege of visiting China on
two previous occasions, and I am a great admirer

00:42.635 --> 00:48.335
of the wisdom and culture of this great nation
that I have visited.

00:48.335 --> 00:53.865
This is beyond My imagination the most glorious
time in the history of the world, that at

00:53.865 --> 00:58.208
this time we are so much aware of the problems
of women.

00:58.208 --> 01:06.351
Women as a whole have definitely suffered
over the ages, as the previous lady has told

01:06.351 --> 01:14.540
you, because we have not realized what their
importance is and what their proper role is

01:14.540 --> 01:16.185
in human society.

01:16.185 --> 01:22.327
Society itself, which is her creation, tries
to control or put down the womanhood.

01:22.327 --> 01:28.228
In the East, we can say, that due to fundamentalist
influence women have been under great pressure

01:28.228 --> 01:31.782
and their morality is based on fear rather
than freedom.

01:31.782 --> 01:38.875
In the West they have fought for their freedom,
but what they have attained is spurious freedom.

01:38.875 --> 01:44.151
The women in the West have freedom to abandon
all social and moral values.

01:44.160 --> 01:49.473
Thus in the East, we can say, that most of
the women are timid, oppressed and cannot

01:49.473 --> 01:55.623
express themselves, while in the West we find
most of the women are reduced to a sex symbol.

01:56.010 --> 01:58.101
They are keen to expose their bodies.

01:58.101 --> 02:03.994
Their anxiety is to appear in fashion advertisements
and very cheap popularity.

02:03.994 --> 02:09.136
Most of them accepted this position because
otherwise they could not have survived in

02:09.136 --> 02:11.302
that chaotic world of the West.

02:11.302 --> 02:17.171
What most of the women in the East would regard
as very humiliating and degrading is regarded

02:17.171 --> 02:21.243
as something very glorifying in the West.

02:21.573 --> 02:27.351
I have seen both the worlds very deeply and
I feel that unless and until you bring a new

02:27.351 --> 02:34.495
culture by which women from the East and West
can both rise in their own esteem and express

02:34.495 --> 02:40.217
themselves in such a way that they create
high moral standards for their society, women

02:40.217 --> 02:46.201
neither in the East nor in the West will rise
to their full stature of feminine speciality.

02:46.201 --> 02:52.176
The speciality is that if women are respected
for their womanhood, understanding what they

02:52.176 --> 02:58.559
are capable of and how they can empower themselves
with all the education needed, all the security

02:58.559 --> 03:03.162
will be provided to them and they will provide
security to the society.

03:03.162 --> 03:09.424
All the fundamentalists who talk of religion
expect women to be absolutely moral and the

03:09.424 --> 03:10.977
men can do whatever they like.

03:10.977 --> 03:16.560
I feel we have to educate men more than women,

03:16.871 --> 03:23.713
because the idea of war comes also only from the men, in the beginning.

03:24.503 --> 03:30.364
I must admit it is not difficult to collect
money for poor women in the developing countries

03:30.364 --> 03:35.427
and help them to get out of their poverty,
but unfortunately My knowledge is that the

03:35.427 --> 03:43.100
money we are collecting may not reach the
poor women but may end up into the pockets

03:43.100 --> 03:47.030
of the corrupt ministers, bureaucrats and
other people in charge, and ultimately it

03:47.030 --> 03:50.177
will end up in the Swiss Bank.

03:50.177 --> 03:56.044
I do not want to criticize any UN organization
because I know they are very honest in their

03:56.044 --> 04:00.844
purpose, but they must be made aware of what
is happening under the table.

04:00.844 --> 04:08.890
We in India have two very big states
called as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar which are

04:08.890 --> 04:13.283
very much helped by UNICEF as well as the
World Health Organization.

04:13.283 --> 04:18.267
UNICEF started a project called Angan, meaning
“courtyard”, where the children were to

04:18.267 --> 04:20.537
be educated and brought up in a proper shape.

04:20.537 --> 04:27.654
This project is not working at all for the
children, but all the money goes into the

04:27.654 --> 04:32.011
pockets of all the corrupt people who are
in charge of that project and the children

04:32.011 --> 04:37.931
do not even get two percent of what is being
sent for them.

04:39.461 --> 04:46.383
Same with the World Health Organization, which
is sending medicines and equipment to India.

04:46.510 --> 04:51.252
These medicines are sold in the market and
are completely used by the recipients for

04:51.354 --> 04:52.452
their own gains.

04:52.452 --> 04:54.954
The same happens to W.H.O. equipment.

04:54.954 --> 04:59.332
So the poor people never get any benefit and
they remain all the time helpless.

04:59.444 --> 05:04.545
All this money is called dirty money but goes
to the clean Swiss bank.

05:09.046 --> 05:14.895
A large part of the loans which the World
Bank gives to the developing country is also

05:15.007 --> 05:19.724
siphoned back to the personal account of the
corrupt officials maintained in Swiss Bank.

05:20.022 --> 05:24.706
Thus all the developing countries are indebted
to the World Bank but have no money.

05:24.706 --> 05:26.425
The money is in the Swiss Bank.

05:26.539 --> 05:31.990
So I would request you all to take this up
with the Swiss Bank and request them to return

05:31.990 --> 05:38.976
all such money which has been siphoned in
the Swiss Bank [Applause] by very corrupt

05:38.976 --> 05:44.637
people and give this money to the UN so that
the UN can utilize it for the education of

05:44.637 --> 05:53.635
women and other purposes as well as what is
to be given to people under very effective vigilance.

05:53.635 --> 06:00.421
One has to have a very good network of people,
especially women, who are involved and who

06:00.421 --> 06:05.890
are honest, compassionate and who would like
to make the best out of this money, helping

06:05.890 --> 06:09.015
the women who have to achieve social equality.

06:09.015 --> 06:18.193
The main work of womanhood is to create a
good society that would enjoy peace better.

06:18.193 --> 06:24.740
Immorality, corruption and violence are the
two horrible monsters which are eating up our society.

06:24.740 --> 06:29.539
I would blame the mothers of these corrupt
and immoral persons because they failed in

06:29.539 --> 06:31.300
their duty as mothers in their childhood.

06:31.300 --> 06:36.985
The loving training of the mother is the first
and most effective influence in shaping the

06:36.985 --> 06:40.301
children into beautiful citizens.

06:40.780 --> 06:45.748
Mothers who never tried to guide with great
concern and love, or the wives or the daughters

06:45.748 --> 06:50.572
who are falling into the fear of the men or
of the destructive culture, have not done

06:50.572 --> 06:56.294
their duty as integral members of the family
to strengthen the moral fiber of the men.

06:56.294 --> 07:01.452
It is important also to see how children are
treated in these two cultures of East and West.

07:01.452 --> 07:05.558
What we see in the East is that the children
would listen to their mothers if they are

07:05.558 --> 07:08.108
not under fundamentalist culture.

07:08.108 --> 07:14.894
This culture relegates women to the level
of an inferior human being, fit to be dominated

07:14.894 --> 07:16.607
by men and children.

07:16.607 --> 07:18.990
In the West also the same thing happens.

07:18.990 --> 07:22.522
Children don’t respect their mothers, neither
do they listen to them.

07:22.522 --> 07:29.308
I feel this is because, generally, the Western
women spend more time looking after their

07:29.308 --> 07:33.485
bodies and looks than on looking after and
loving their children.

07:33.485 --> 07:38.788
The nexus between the mother and children
weakens and then it is for this reason that

07:38.788 --> 07:42.000
many children become street urchins and violent.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.847
Fortunately there are still many families
in the East and some in the West who deeply

07:46.847 --> 07:52.796
defy the corrupting influence of today and
look after their children and bring them up properly.

07:52.796 --> 07:58.816
But still I must say that the children in
the East are not that much ruined as they are in the West.

07:58.816 --> 08:05.076
The reason, also, is that in the East there
are many people who have not taken to fundamentalist

08:05.076 --> 08:10.067
culture or to the Western culture and have
a very good society and produce children who

08:10.067 --> 08:13.694
are exceptionally good, though this number
may not be very great.

08:13.694 --> 08:19.643
But whatever culture they have inherited,
since long, traditionally, is very much ingrained

08:19.643 --> 08:24.970
in them and to them the moral value system
is the highest, more than money or power.

08:25.975 --> 08:27.807
The West is full of problems.

08:27.807 --> 08:31.937
Though they have money, they don’t have
peace within themselves.

08:33.421 --> 08:39.082
The truth is that women are the potential
power of every civilization and every country.

08:39.082 --> 08:44.839
It is evident that women are the creators
and the preservers of the entire humankind.

08:44.839 --> 08:49.783
This is the role which the almighty God has
given, assigned to them.

08:50.046 --> 08:52.405
Seeds cannot create anything by themselves.

08:52.405 --> 08:57.683
It is the Mother Earth which provides the
flowers and the fruits and other bounties.

08:59.023 --> 09:05.163
Similarly, it is the woman who create the
child, who nurtures the baby and eventually

09:05.163 --> 09:07.163
brings up the citizen of tomorrow.

09:07.163 --> 09:12.274
Women must therefore rank with Mother Earth
as the edifice of the entire humanity.

09:12.274 --> 09:17.505
Unfortunately, men have utilized muscle power
to gain a dominating position over women.

09:17.505 --> 09:27.952
They have not recognized that women are complementary
and equal, but not similar partners in human endeavors.

09:28.311 --> 09:35.121
A society that does not recognize this fundamental
truth and does not give to women their rightful

09:35.121 --> 09:37.121
role is not a civilized society.

09:37.121 --> 09:43.548
In My own country there is a saying in Sanskrit,
“Yatra narya pujyante tatra ramante devata”,

09:43.548 --> 09:50.669
which means that “Where the women are respected
and respectable, there resides the gods of our well-being."

09:50.669 --> 09:58.149
So it is for us, at this moment, to understand
the value of this great power that is given to us by our Creator.

09:58.149 --> 09:59.790
But what do we find?

09:59.790 --> 10:05.618
Whether in the East or in the West, women
have not been able to give a full manifestation of their greatness.

10:05.618 --> 10:12.000
I am not suggesting at all that the only role
of women in human society is that of the mother,

10:12.000 --> 10:16.752
the procreator and preserver of children, or that of a wife, or a sister.

10:16.752 --> 10:23.657
Women have a full right to participate as
equal partners in every aspect of life – social,

10:23.657 --> 10:28.265
cultural, educational, political, economical,
administrative and the rest.

10:28.552 --> 10:34.142
In order to prepare themselves for this all-pervading
role, they must have the right to education

10:34.142 --> 10:35.903
in all branches of knowledge.

10:35.903 --> 10:41.875
But if they are mothers, they have a great
responsibility towards their children as well as their society.

10:41.875 --> 10:47.856
Men are responsible for politics and economics
of the country, but women are responsible for the society.

10:47.856 --> 10:54.212
Women can also support men and they can take
a leading part, of course, in any post, but

10:54.212 --> 10:59.084
it is very important that they should not
forget they are women who have to manifest

10:59.084 --> 11:01.563
deep motherly concern and love.

11:01.563 --> 11:06.195
If they become manly and aggressive, the balance
of the society cannot be maintained.

11:08.851 --> 11:13.579
At the same time I must submit that, while
we ask for the rights of women, we must also

11:13.579 --> 11:17.566
stress the fundamental duties of women to
the human society.

11:17.566 --> 11:26.456
The women in the West, or those who are educated
in the West, also some others I have seen,

11:26.456 --> 11:34.127
have gone to the other extreme when they are
taking to political, economical or administrative roles.

11:34.127 --> 11:41.392
To compete with men they have become much
too self-willed, self-centered and ambitious.

11:41.392 --> 11:47.699
They have no more their soothing, pleasing
qualities which can bring peace and balance.

11:47.699 --> 11:52.714
On the contrary, they become dominating, pleasure-seeking
individuals.

11:52.714 --> 11:58.279
They are far more worried about their physical
attractions than about having a pleasing,

11:58.279 --> 12:00.590
sweet and dignified personality.

12:00.590 --> 12:07.065
They give into their baser self much faster
than men, wittingly or unwittingly.

12:07.065 --> 12:16.182
All this leads to chaotic societies and children
grow up into street urchins, preparing for wars.

12:16.996 --> 12:20.049
What we need is a balance between the two
extremes.

12:20.049 --> 12:25.303
We need women as equal but not similar partners
with men, but with a subtle understanding

12:25.303 --> 12:31.252
of the nature of men and how to bring them
into the center with their inner balance.

12:31.252 --> 12:37.057
We need balanced women in order to have a
balanced human race with peace within itself.

12:37.057 --> 12:42.790
You might say all this is excellent in thought,
but how do we achieve this state of balance?

12:42.790 --> 12:50.010
How do we stem the tide of diseases, corruption,
immorality, immaturity and violence?

12:50.010 --> 12:53.158
How do we end the present state of conflict
and confusion?

12:53.158 --> 12:57.072
How do we bring about peace within every mind
and heart?

12:57.072 --> 13:01.106
I very humbly submit that there is an answer
to these questions.

13:01.106 --> 13:02.795
There is a new way…

13:02.795 --> 13:05.824
Do you want Me to tell the new way?

13:06.374 --> 13:08.374
Moderator: Just tell them.

13:10.528 --> 13:12.528
You have three more minutes.

13:14.347 --> 13:19.889
Whatever I am going to tell you now is not
be taken for granted.

13:19.889 --> 13:26.005
You should, of course, have your minds open
like scientists and treat whatever I am stating as a hypothesis.

13:26.005 --> 13:31.164
If this hypothesis can be proved, then you
have to accept it as honest persons as the

13:31.164 --> 13:34.887
absolute truth because it is for your benevolence.

13:36.275 --> 13:38.274
It is for the benevolence of your family.

13:38.274 --> 13:43.696
It is for the benevolence of your country
and for the benevolence of the whole world.

13:43.696 --> 13:48.711
I am here to tell you about the last breakthrough
of our evolution.

13:48.711 --> 13:55.616
This breakthrough of our evolution in our
awareness has to happen in these modern times

13:55.616 --> 14:02.761
and has been, moreover, recorded in the writings
of many seers.

14:02.761 --> 14:10.121
These are the times called as the “Decadent
Times”, last called by the great saint Vyasa

14:10.121 --> 14:15.830
who has written the Gita, and it is the decadence
of humanity that we see around in every way

14:15.830 --> 14:20.821
possible, and unless and until we improve
that, wars cannot be avoided.

14:20.821 --> 14:24.471
Now I would like to tell the secret knowledge of our inner being

14:24.471 --> 14:26.985
which was known in India thousands of years back.

14:26.985 --> 14:32.168
For our evolution and spiritual ascent there
is a residual power within us which is located

14:32.168 --> 14:34.287
in the triangular bone at the base of our
spine.

14:34.287 --> 14:37.746
This residual power is known as Kundalini.

14:37.746 --> 14:42.857
Though the knowledge of this power was available
thousands of years back in India, the awakening

14:42.857 --> 14:46.604
of the Kundalini was done, traditionally,
on an individual basis only.

14:46.604 --> 14:49.848
One guru would give awakening to one disciple.

14:49.848 --> 14:52.141
As a result of that awakening, what happens

14:52.141 --> 14:55.318
is that you achieve your Self Realization, your Selfhood.

14:55.318 --> 15:00.333
Secondly, when this power is awakened, it
rises and passes through six subtle energy

15:00.333 --> 15:05.205
centers in your body, nourishing them and
integrating them.

15:06.000 --> 15:10.944
Ultimately, this power breaks through the
fontanel bone area called as the Taloo or

15:10.944 --> 15:16.103
the Brahmarandra and connects you to the all-pervading
power of Divine love, which is described in

15:16.103 --> 15:21.429
the Bible also as the cool breeze of the Holy
Ghost also in the Koran as Ruh and also in

15:21.429 --> 15:23.859
the Indian scriptures as Paramchaitanya.

15:23.859 --> 15:26.576
Patanjali has called it as Ritambhara Pragya.

15:26.576 --> 15:31.185
Whatever the name, this is a power which is
all-pervading, which does all the subtle works

15:31.185 --> 15:34.262
of living process, of evolutionary process.

15:34.262 --> 15:39.110
The existence of this all-pervading energy
is not felt before Realization, but after

15:39.110 --> 15:42.000
Self Realization you can feel it on your fingertips

15:42.000 --> 15:46.159
or at the center of your palm or above the fontanel bone area.

15:46.159 --> 15:49.428
Moreover, this process has to be spontaneous,
Sahaja.

15:49.428 --> 15:51.954
Saha means with and ja means born.

15:51.954 --> 15:56.323
That means the right to get this union with
the all-pervading power of Divine love is

15:56.323 --> 15:58.323
the birthright of every human being.

15:58.323 --> 16:00.323
Our mental energies are limited.

16:00.323 --> 16:06.319
Our limited mental energy, which is linear
in movement and has no sustenance of reality,

16:06.319 --> 16:09.252
reaches a point and stops.

16:09.252 --> 16:16.732
From there it boomerangs and all mental, linear
movement comes back to us as a punishment sometimes.

16:16.732 --> 16:22.872
So now we need more energy, higher energy,
deeper energy and for that this happening

16:22.872 --> 16:25.853
has to take place if we don’t want to have
another war.

16:25.853 --> 16:33.620
I must say that in the West, I have met many
people who are true seekers of Truth and are

16:33.620 --> 16:37.175
fed up of artificiality of the Western life.

16:37.175 --> 16:43.124
Also they didn’t know what they were seeking
sometimes and they have made lots of mistakes.

16:43.124 --> 16:48.139
They have gone to false gurus who have taken
lots of money and the people have become bankrupts

16:48.139 --> 16:50.139
and mentally and physically handicapped.

16:50.498 --> 16:58.337
The one thing you must note that the awakening
of the Kundalini and thus achieving Self-Realization

16:58.337 --> 17:02.682
is a living process of evolution for which
we cannot pay anything.

17:02.682 --> 17:05.809
It is like putting a seed in the Mother Earth.

17:05.809 --> 17:09.652
It sprouts because Mother Earth has the power
to sprout it.

17:14.392 --> 17:20.991
Which shows – in the same way we have this
germinating power in the triangular bone which

17:20.991 --> 17:24.484
Greeks called as Sacrum which is a three and
a half coiled energy

17:24.484 --> 17:31.482
which shows that the Greeks knew that this was a sacred bone and hence they gave the same name, Sacrum.

17:31.482 --> 17:37.007
Actually in some people you can see this triangular
bone pulsating and the Kundalini very slowly

17:37.007 --> 17:40.435
rising, but there are many who have got Self
Realization.

17:40.435 --> 17:45.106
Now this Sahaja Yoga is working in 85 nations,

17:45.106 --> 17:49.153
and they have all become extremely peaceful

17:49.153 --> 17:51.280
with each other.

17:51.280 --> 17:58.073
In their hearts, they’re integrated and
they have become extremely loving and compassionate.

17:58.073 --> 18:01.141
I’m sorry I can’t tell you more, but the
time is over.

18:01.141 --> 18:02.514
I hope you don’t mind.

18:02.514 --> 18:07.202
Thank you very much.
