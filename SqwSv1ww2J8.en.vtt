00:00:07.803 --> 00:00:15.142
Yesterday I saw the whole sky was filled with color and light.

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.935
As you know that vibrations have light.

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.374
It’s very light flickering, very small light,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:32.213
each particle of vibration has and you can see that.

00:00:32.377 --> 00:00:40.884
But when there are too many, 
then they can be caught up by your cameras.

00:00:41.058 --> 00:00:46.451
But yesterday I think the clouds got vibrated.

00:00:47.808 --> 00:00:51.654
And is a very great thing to get the clouds vibrated.

00:00:51.761 --> 00:00:55.486
If the clouds are vibrated, the rain will be vibrated.

00:00:55.647 --> 00:01:01.403
If the rain is vibrated, the land will be vibrated.

00:01:01.858 --> 00:01:11.661
All the crops that are to be
germinated will be vibrated too,

00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:18.703
so when it goes into the body of human beings, 
they’ll get also vibrations.

00:01:18.877 --> 00:01:22.050
Is the best way now is to vibrate the clouds, I think,

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.050
if you have to have many more people for Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.717
That’s the idea came into My mind last night

00:01:30.945 --> 00:01:35.250
that why not vibrate all the clouds, that’s the best way.

00:01:38.283 --> 00:01:46.430
Moreover the vibrations are very tiny bit,

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:54.440
with one point going into a half circle normally.

00:01:56.012 --> 00:02:01.579
This half circle then combines to make “Aum” sometimes,

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:09.150
sometimes it makes a chain, sometimes
it gathers together to make crosses.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:16.225
But the basic thing about them is that they can think,

00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:20.769
and think very fast, much faster

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.010
than human beings can think.

00:02:23.171 --> 00:02:27.553
And they are extremely collective, extremely collective.

00:02:27.742 --> 00:02:31.952
So they move together,

00:02:32.845 --> 00:02:37.750
thinking the same way, understanding the same way 
in an absolute manner

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.797
and work out the whole thing

00:02:39.957 --> 00:02:48.867
in a very beautiful silent way that you cannot even feel.
