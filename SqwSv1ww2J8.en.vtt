00:07.803 --> 00:15.142
Yesterday I saw the whole sky was filled with color and light.

00:15.509 --> 00:18.935
As you know that vibrations have light.

00:21.099 --> 00:25.374
It’s very light flickering, very small light,

00:25.540 --> 00:32.213
each particle of vibration has and you can see that.

00:32.377 --> 00:40.884
But when there are too many,
then they can be caught up by your cameras.

00:41.058 --> 00:46.451
But yesterday I think the clouds got vibrated.

00:47.808 --> 00:51.654
And is a very great thing to get the clouds vibrated.

00:51.761 --> 00:55.486
If the clouds are vibrated, the rain will be vibrated.

00:55.647 --> 01:01.403
If the rain is vibrated, the land will be vibrated.

01:01.858 --> 01:11.661
All the crops that are to be
germinated will be vibrated too,

01:11.821 --> 01:18.703
so when it goes into the body of human beings,
they’ll get also vibrations.

01:18.877 --> 01:22.050
Is the best way now is to vibrate the clouds, I think,

01:22.210 --> 01:26.050
if you have to have many more people for Sahaja Yoga.

01:27.550 --> 01:30.717
That’s the idea came into My mind last night

01:30.945 --> 01:35.250
that why not vibrate all the clouds, that’s the best way.

01:38.283 --> 01:46.430
Moreover the vibrations are very tiny bit,

01:46.590 --> 01:54.440
with one point going into a half circle normally.

01:56.012 --> 02:01.579
This half circle then combines to make “Aum” sometimes,

02:01.740 --> 02:09.150
sometimes it makes a chain, sometimes
it gathers together to make crosses.

02:09.150 --> 02:16.225
But the basic thing about them is that they can think,

02:17.611 --> 02:20.769
and think very fast, much faster

02:20.930 --> 02:23.010
than human beings can think.

02:23.171 --> 02:27.553
And they are extremely collective, extremely collective.

02:27.742 --> 02:31.952
So they move together,

02:32.845 --> 02:37.750
thinking the same way, understanding the same way
in an absolute manner

02:37.910 --> 02:39.797
and work out the whole thing

02:39.957 --> 02:48.867
in a very beautiful silent way that you cannot even feel.
