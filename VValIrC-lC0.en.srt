1
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:22,019
Welcome back

2
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:27,979
I guess Indian gurus have been involved over recent years in the West, when the Beatles introduced us to the Maharishi.

3
00:00:27,979 --> 00:00:33,149
The orange people blindly followed the bad one, but they have been others far more credible and far more respectful.

4
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:34,779
My next guest is a Bombay lady

5
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:36,979
Who's following is growing around the world.

6
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:43,679
She says that you have the power to deal positively with every problem from common to cancer.

7
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,879
All you have to do is now have a tap... , tapping that power.

8
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:51,279
Please welcome the lady acclaimed as India's greatest living Saint,

9
00:00:51,279 --> 00:00:59,319
the Mother of Sahaja Yoga, Shri Mataji.
 Welcome.

10
00:00:59,319 --> 00:01:04,379
I know it's ...Welcome to Australia, I know it's very difficult for you, for anyone to sum up one's religion,

11
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,279
but is it possible to say what is Sahaja Yoga?

12
00:01:08,279 --> 00:01:13,079
Sahaja- "saha" means "with"," ja" is "born with you".

13
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:16,279
This is born with you. Within us is the power

14
00:01:16,779 --> 00:01:20,779
which can give us the status of a Spirit.

15
00:01:20,779 --> 00:01:22,509
We are not yet the Spirit.

16
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:25,279
We are at a human level .

17
00:01:25,279 --> 00:01:32,279
And in the evolutionary process we have to now have the breakthrough to become the Spirit.

18
00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:34,369
 That's very essential and is absolutely

19
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:40,279
eventually the all possible natural thing that has to happen.

20
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:47,479
It should happen to all of us and the time has come for you to get to that position where you become the Spirit.

21
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:54,479
All the religions have talked about it and told about it, but people have gone wrong in believing that

22
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:59,479
artificially if you say that you are baptized

23
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:04,779
or you have become a Brahmin or you have become a pire that you have become the Spirit.

24
00:02:04,779 --> 00:02:08,379
It's not that.
It's a happening that has to take place within ourselves

25
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:15,679
Which is a living process, absolutely a living process of living Divine force within ourselves.

26
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:19,479
How does this.. we have heard of lots of yogas,

27
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:23,489
How does this differ from other any yoga?

28
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:28,579
Other yoga's were practiced mostly after getting Realization.

29
00:02:28,619 --> 00:02:33,679
But as it has come from some half-baked people,

30
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:39,079
it is in a very funny way that people follow it as if they have to take all the medicines together.

31
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:42,079
And they don't know any discrimination about it.

32
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:47,279
Unless and until you make this force rise within you, you will not know

33
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:51,279
what type of attention is needed

34
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,579
 and what type of physical exercise is needed.

35
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,079
Indiscriminately people do physical exercises getting into trouble.

36
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:03,079
Now you are speaking of the force. Is it possible to say where this force emanate from?

37
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:09,279
This force is a residual power in our triangular bone called as sacrum.

38
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:11,729
Sacrum

39
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:15,079
Now the sacrum is a word that comes from Greece

40
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:19,659
and that means Greek people knew this was a sacred bone.

41
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:23,849
It rises from there, passes through our six centers

42
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:31,479
piercing through our fontanel bone area and you get the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your head.

43
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:35,279
-That's what Christians refer to it?
- Yes. I mean, Holy Ghost.

44
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:38,079
What is the Holy Ghost? Nobody can explain,

45
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:43,079
but Holy Ghost is very simple to understand. This is the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us.

46
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:46,079
Holy Ghost is the desire of God.

47
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:50,279
God Himself watches the working of the desire.

48
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:56,279
And the desire is that we all should become the Spirit.

49
00:03:56,279 --> 00:04:03,479
And this desire is reflected in our triangular bone, in three and a half coils. When it..

50
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:07,579
 -Is this the central nervous system?
-No. It is in the triangular bone.

51
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:10,579
It's this force. This is the forth force within us. You see,

52
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:13,679
we have sympathetic nervous system, left and right

53
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:17,879
and we have got autonomous, that is an autonomous nervous system and parasympathetic

54
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,879
 and we have also central nervous system.

55
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:22,979
Now this is the system which is not yet working.

56
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:25,279
It is still in the triangular bone.

57
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:30,279
When it rises it gives you you a new dimension of the Spirit.

58
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:34,679
Means the light of the Spirit comes in our attention.

59
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:38,919
In that case what happens. It's very simple to understand that

60
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:44,379
at human level we are not in the absolute state,

61
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:47,279
not in the absolute state. That's why there is a chaos.

62
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,579
Supposing I'm holding a snake in my hands, you see, and there's no light.

63
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:53,779
Somebody tells me that there's a snake. I will not throw it away.

64
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:56,779
I would not like to listen to anybody's advice about it.

65
00:04:56,779 --> 00:04:58,779
But if there's a light, I'll throw it away.

66
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:04,379
 In the same way when you become the Spirit, the light of the Spirit guides you.

67
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:09,679
You become your own master, you become your own guru. You don't have to have any guru for that.

68
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,779
This piercing of the fontanel bone by the Kundalini

69
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:17,079
 gives you the power of the Spirit.

70
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:20,979
But.. you will demonstrate us or at least will give you a chance to demonstrate

71
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:25,079
But you're talking about a physical power of the Spirit that comes out of the top of your head?

72
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,779
-No, it's an energy.
-An energy, alright.

73
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:31,579
It's an energy, which comes out of your fontanel bone area, here,

74
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:35,879
area, touching the Spirit,
but the Spirit actually resides in the heart.

75
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,579
But the main seat of the heart is here in the fontanel bone area.

76
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:43,089
And it pierces through, when it pierces through

77
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:46,979
actually it should pierce, it is not just I say I baptize you, It's not like that.

78
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,779
It has to pierce through that

79
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:52,779
and you have to feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost on top of your head.

80
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:54,679
-Is it there now?
-Yes it is there.

81
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:57,779
-Can I feel it?
- I don’t know if you’ll feel it or not,

82
00:05:57,779 --> 00:05:59,779
because you have to have that sensitivity.

83
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:07,779
Now, it is all around, also that All-pervading Power is there, which makes everything vibrate.

84
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:12,979
But this energy can be felt only when you have got that Realization.

85
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:17,979
Then what happens that all your centers on your fingertips become sensitive.

86
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:24,419
And you can feel this is written in the Quran that your hands will speak when you get to your Resurrection.

87
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:25,479
- Yes.
- This is a Resurrection.

88
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:29,879
But Mataji, you must know, you must realize, I mentioned about Maharishi, about the bad ones,

89
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:32,879
you must live with the sceptics and the doubters because...

90
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,879
-Of course, of course, I’m living with them all the time.
-Because they come before you.

91
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:44,779
Now firstly you see, the great mistake we commit, as far as going to gurus or to anything that is religious,

92
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,379
is that you cannot pay for God.

93
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:50,279
You see it's a living process of a living God.

94
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,359
Now supposing you want to sprout a seed.

95
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:55,079
How much money do you pay to the Mother Earth?

96
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:57,779
It's a very simple thing, but people don't understand.

97
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:00,879
They think that they can purchase everything.

98
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,079
You cannot purchase God.

99
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:07,379
A simple method if you apply to all of them they will all run away.

100
00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:14,779
Yes, now again. I read that the Spirit, this power you speak of, can deal with ...common

101
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:18,479
I'm into the content, but can deal with cancer, with AIDS,
-Yes, yes.

102
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:24,019
I've had some Australians talk about their children being heroin addicts and and

103
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:28,679
Yes, of course, of course, it can, it does. Because see I'll show you now.

104
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:34,079
This is the centre, you can say this is the medulla oblongata

105
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,969
or we can say this is through which the central canal is passing.

106
00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:40,679
Now, the centre is inside here.

107
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:45,179
 Now when we are in the imbalance, say we go too much towards the left side

108
00:07:45,179 --> 00:07:49,679
means we become too emotional or do all kinds of wrong nonsensical conditionings,

109
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:55,179
then or if you go too much to the right in ego and all that, you see, then we break.

110
00:07:55,179 --> 00:07:58,279
Once we break this what happens that

111
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:03,779
the center becomes constricted and the energy becomes constricted.

112
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:08,779
Slowly it breaks the relationship with the head, with the whole

113
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,279
and it becomes malignant. When it becomes malignant

114
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:17,279
it starts overpowering other cells and that's how cancer is settled.

115
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,579
Now when the Kundalini rises what she does

116
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:23,629
she enlightens this centre here, first of all, she brings it back to normal

117
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:29,079
and then she goes up there, pierces through by which she does one great thing

118
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:34,079
is to make you in contact with the All-pervading Power.

119
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:37,279
And once that power starts flowing through you, you don't have to worry.

120
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,249
You become absolutely peaceful, all your troubles are over.

121
00:08:40,249 --> 00:08:43,879
Actually, most of the troubles can be over once you are the Spirit.

122
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:46,409
All right. It's very difficult to understand and

123
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:51,279
Understand ..[...] as I'm doing now. You have offered to give a demonstration with our audience?

124
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,869
-Yes, I think I'll try but it's a very short time.
-Would you like?

125
00:08:53,869 --> 00:08:57,679
And they are all in a hurry I think to catch the buses or something.

126
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,079
 No. no, they've got time to try.

127
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:00,779
All right. Let's see.

128
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:04,779
Now, you just put your hands towards me, just like this.

129
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:12,779
And put your right hand on your heart.

130
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:20,179
and say with full faith in yourself that you are the Spirit.

131
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:23,379
 That's in your heart you have to say. "Mother, I am the Spirit".

132
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:27,079
You can call me Mother or you can call me Shri Mataji.

133
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:29,799
"I am the Spirit". Please say three times

134
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:34,279
with full confidence in yourself.

135
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:47,779
Now put the right hand towards me and see on top of your head

136
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:51,779
 if you are getting a cool breeze coming out of your head.

137
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:57,479
Yes, yes, here. On top of ... some people get it that high.

138
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:02,779
Watch me without thinking. Watch me without thinking.

139
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:05,859
Put your right hand towards me, right, right hand towards me,

140
00:10:05,859 --> 00:10:10,379
right hand towards me and left hand on top of your head.

141
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:14,979
Right hand I am saying, right hand towards me you are doing all wrong.

142
00:10:14,979 --> 00:10:18,969
Now see. Is it all right?

143
00:10:18,969 --> 00:10:22,779
-Are you getting the cool breeze in your head?
-Say yes, if you are.

144
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:29,779
Yes, yes, yes. I can see your eyes are.. Eyes will start glistening, you see, there will be a light in your eyes.

145
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:36,779
Now, are you thinking now? Just watch me without thinking. Let's see, can you do that?

146
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:42,479
Watch me without thinking. Can you do that?

147
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:50,599
You can.

148
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:54,879
You cannot do that otherwise. You see, so you have gone beyond thought.

149
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,279
Now just feel it. Are you feeling it in the hand also? Just let's see.

150
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:01,179
Put your hands up if you've felt some way.

151
00:11:01,219 --> 00:11:03,579
Put up all your hands. All of those who have felt it.

152
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:07,279
Put both the hands. I would like to see both the hands.

153
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,279
Let me show them, Madame.

154
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:11,419
Yes, so many of them who have got it.

155
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:14,879
-Now we have some of your followers here ...
-Yes, who else?

156
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:17,279
-up, up here we had.
-All right, let's see.

157
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:21,059
Those who have felt in the head just put your hands up.

158
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,259
Surprising, the audience seems to be..

159
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:35,739
Yesterday we had 1500 people out there and about 500 people upstairs.

160
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:38,379
-And most of them got Realisation.
-Yes.

161
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:41,779
Now, in fact, we should have said in the past when you've done it in Britain and

162
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:44,579
you've actually through radio and television you've told people

163
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:48,279
-at home to do the same.
-No, it’s Hong Kong. I did it in Hong Kong. Not in a..

164
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:52,849
In Hong Kong people are very sensitive. There are very sensitive people in Hong Kong.

165
00:11:52,849 --> 00:11:57,579
Perhaps they are in trouble now, because they have to go away and all that. May be that is it.

166
00:11:57,579 --> 00:12:00,779
People who are in need are more sensitive, are they?

167
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:03,779
I’d think so, because then they hanker after God.

168
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:09,079
You see, otherwise they think. “We are alright, what to care for God, you see, who is God after all?”

169
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:11,579
So it happens. But it should happen to so many.

170
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:13,779
 I'm surprised they haven't got.

171
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:17,079
Let's see again how many have got it. Let's see.

172
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:19,189
 Put your hands up. Let's see. Just see.

173
00:12:19,189 --> 00:12:19,689
They're reluctant even to put the hand to see, you see?

174
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:25,079
Now just see it on your head.

175
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:29,379
I've been distracted actually. I'm not a fair test for this because I've been watching things happening in this studio.

176
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:31,909
Yes, that's it and they are...

177
00:12:31,909 --> 00:12:34,279
Are you feeling it?

178
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:37,279
No? None of you?

179
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,449
I think there’s something wrong.

180
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:42,379
I can feel the breezes coming from them, I can feel it.

181
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:45,679
Some of them are do feeling it. You see those, who are really feeling it,

182
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:49,579
do not feel ashamed and just say "Yes, we are feeling it. That's the best.

183
00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:53,879
Can you raise your hands now, let's see?

184
00:12:54,609 --> 00:12:58,279
These are all my disciples I think.

185
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:03,279
-Surprising. Otherwise Australians are very good.
-Are they? We were receptive, were we?

186
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:08,279
They are the best people. They are very innocent  and they get their realization very fast.

187
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:11,279
They stick on to it, and they have done wonders. They have done wonders.

188
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:17,079
I should make the point that I saw one of your advertisements in one of the papers today and  I think your..

189
00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:21,769
there is a meeting tonight at the State Theatre in Sydney, but there is no fee charge.

190
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:22,779
Of course not.

191
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:24,779
-You’re not charging?
-No, no, not at all,

192
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:27,279
-You are not rounding up money?
-No.

193
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,179
No, I should make. Alright, we thank you for your time.

194
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:31,079
 You're staying another week or so in Australia?
-Yes.

195
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:35,779
You’ve been to other states, and you are now doing in Sydney?
-Yes. I’ll be going to Melbourne.

196
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,279
-Sydney, Melbourne and New Zealand.
-And to New Zealand also.

197
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:40,779
Alright, we thank you. I'm sure if you'd like to see Mataji,
-Thank you very much.

198
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:44,069
 you could check your regular newspapers and find where she's meeting people.

199
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:46,169
Thank you very much today. Please thank Her Mataji.
