00:00:01.268 --> 00:00:07.800
What a beautiful place, eh? You don't have
something like this in London or in England.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.800
Beautiful! I wonder if you have any cable cars.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.800
Will we have in England any able cars?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.468
Yogis: Scotland, in Scotland.
Shri Mataji: We have?

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.263
Hello, how are you?

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:42.567
Something like Bogota, so far.

00:00:47.697 --> 00:00:53.075
Best place for a honeymoon.

00:00:53.712 --> 00:00:59.800
Best place to come for a honeymoon. Beautiful.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.800
Yogi: Relax a little bit. I know.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.800
Gregoire: It's working now.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.800
Shri Mataji: Is that our, our tent?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.800
Gregoire: This is our...
Shri Mataji: Our tent?

00:01:24.977 --> 00:01:30.800
Shri Mataji: What a place to come to.
Olympia, what a beautiful place, eh?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.800
Aren't you enjoying?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.800
Have you been here before?
Girl: No.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.354
Shri Mataji: Not, have you been? Ah.

00:01:43.554 --> 00:01:47.463
Many of you might have come for the first time even.

00:01:47.663 --> 00:01:53.943
Gregoire: I was here, but I didn't know I
would come back with you. Shri Mataji: With Me.

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.530
Yogi: Shri Mataji, you did
everything, because the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.471
people in the hotel, they
give us the [inaudible].

00:02:01.671 --> 00:02:08.125
They give us the plates, they give us the ghee.
Shri Mataji: Really?!

00:02:11.492 --> 00:02:15.800
They are very nice people
here. Germans are so nice, huh.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.800
They are becoming nice people.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.800
I can manage, I can manage.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.094
I'm all right on the mountains.

00:02:26.294 --> 00:02:28.796
Gregoire: In Marathi?
Shri Mataji: In Marathi.

00:02:28.996 --> 00:02:32.517
Gregoire: Sha...sha...
Shri Mataji: Yes Shaila, Shailavati.

00:02:32.717 --> 00:02:35.800
Shaila is the peak, peak of the mountain.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.800
Born on the peak.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.151
Thank you, such a...
Oh, Shri Ganesha is here!

00:02:45.351 --> 00:02:50.854
Guido: This is a present for you, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: What a beauty.

00:02:51.054 --> 00:02:58.679
There cannot be more beautiful
than this. Oh, what an idea.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.393
Thank you, I will be sitting.

00:03:07.593 --> 00:03:12.593
What a place, eh?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.110
In the Devi Mahatma you must have read that...
Gregoire: I will translate in French if you want?

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.651
Shri Mataji: Yes. It is said that all the
best things are meant for bad, evil people.

00:03:31.851 --> 00:03:38.024
And that's how all your Switzerland
was utilized by all kinds of cults

00:03:38.224 --> 00:03:44.976
and horrible gurus who
came here and settled down.

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:08.679
And people helped them when they
came here because they had money.

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:23.008
But luckily, all our struggle against
them and the fight against them,

00:04:23.208 --> 00:04:28.890
and the fight against them is making
them fall down now, one by one,

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.144
and so many are saved from them.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.286
So all the beautiful places,

00:04:47.486 --> 00:04:53.800
all the beauty that God has created is meant for sages.

00:05:05.664 --> 00:05:09.285
For the yogis.

00:05:09.485 --> 00:05:15.336
And not for these horrible, evil people.

00:05:16.813 --> 00:05:24.813
And also not for the rich who
waste their life in irreligious life.

00:05:32.686 --> 00:05:36.057
And also not for the so-called religious

00:05:36.257 --> 00:05:42.800
who deceive God and make money out of it.

00:05:49.177 --> 00:05:55.373
It is meant or created for
the people who are genuine,

00:05:55.573 --> 00:06:03.162
who are real, who are God's
dear ones, who are blessed.

00:06:12.676 --> 00:06:18.106
In the Bible there is quite a lot of
quoting about blessed are those,

00:06:18.306 --> 00:06:24.699
I would say blessed are
those who are Sahaja Yogis.

00:06:38.647 --> 00:06:45.213
Because they are the only ones who
are capable of becoming the real masters

00:06:45.413 --> 00:06:51.640
who can raise the Kundalini
and make people meet the Divine.

00:06:59.825 --> 00:07:07.825
They do it free, absolutely,
selflessly, because they enjoy it.

00:07:18.545 --> 00:07:24.866
They enjoy everything, that's their reward.

00:07:31.567 --> 00:07:36.997
So now on this mountain where we are,

00:07:37.197 --> 00:07:40.225
is such a pure atmosphere,

00:07:40.425 --> 00:07:48.425
we have to make a very genuine promise.

00:07:54.306 --> 00:08:02.306
That this havan that is going on here is
the power of the Nabhi which is the swaha.

00:08:10.718 --> 00:08:17.665
Which completely consumes all that is evil, digests it

00:08:17.865 --> 00:08:24.319
and uses whatever is good for nourishment.

00:08:34.336 --> 00:08:37.485
In the same way we have to promise

00:08:37.685 --> 00:08:43.971
that we will be consuming

00:08:44.171 --> 00:08:49.237
all that is evil in a way to destroy it

00:08:49.437 --> 00:08:57.437
and we will digest and nourish
ourselves with the Divine knowledge.

00:09:17.651 --> 00:09:23.404
Gregoire: I would like to say it in
another language because it is a promise.

00:10:55.856 --> 00:11:01.288
Shri Mataji: And let this havan also, completely

00:11:01.488 --> 00:11:09.207
use its power as swaha for
Switzerland and for the whole world.

00:11:28.793 --> 00:11:36.793
As you know the Devi is called as
Shaila Putri, meaning born on the peak.

00:11:46.963 --> 00:11:56.355
And the tip of the Sahasrara is also called
as shikara, means the shaila, means the,

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:06.110
what do you call it,
the epitome, the epitome of the peak.

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:20.649
So we are here today to celebrate
on top of this Sahasrara of Switzerland.

00:12:33.074 --> 00:12:36.592
But that's only possible
when we have crossed the brain

00:12:36.792 --> 00:12:44.000
and brain crossing is only possible when
you have the knowledge about Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:52.335 --> 00:13:00.335
You must know about Sahaja Yoga,
people know how to raise the Kundalini. But...

00:13:02.194 --> 00:13:09.396
You have to read, you have to understand
it in every aspect of Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:10.279 --> 00:13:15.357
So this joy will be complete.

00:13:16.583 --> 00:13:23.415
Because when you read about it, you will be
surprised that you already know all this.

00:13:36.244 --> 00:13:44.244
And that you will be surprised that
your mind will discover many more things.

00:13:50.978 --> 00:13:58.978
For discretion, for talking to people
how to bring them round to the right path.

00:14:10.121 --> 00:14:14.633
So one has to know about it,
the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga,

00:14:14.833 --> 00:14:20.754
the inverts, so that you can speak to people.

00:14:29.146 --> 00:14:32.911
There are many who have got Advent
[Gregoire's book] with them just like a Bible

00:14:33.111 --> 00:14:38.787
but nobody has, so many have not read it.

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:59.020
There is no rock of Gibraltar anymore there,
it's on in the back of it that you need not read.

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:16.148
That's a fact, what can I do?

00:15:27.519 --> 00:15:32.420
He didn't translate Me properly.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:37.620
Gregoire: I give the meaning.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.874
Shri Mataji: They told me in America
that my photographs where I am happy

00:15:47.074 --> 00:15:54.637
and laughing one should not
give, should give a very serious face.

00:15:59.705 --> 00:16:03.449
Because this horrible Guru here is called the 'Giggly Guru'

00:16:03.649 --> 00:16:09.845
and because he laughs but you can see
he is sinister, there is no truth in him.

00:16:24.506 --> 00:16:32.506
So now we have to start our
Havan with all sincerity, let us do it.

00:16:39.154 --> 00:16:44.966
108 names, are we not? 108 names.

00:16:45.166 --> 00:16:51.755
Our 108 names. That we must be having.

00:16:53.764 --> 00:16:58.459
So may God bless you.

00:16:58.659 --> 00:17:02.659
Good.

00:17:05.537 --> 00:17:11.800
The horrible thing is... All right.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000
So all those who sat for the
puja should come forward here.

00:17:30.138 --> 00:17:34.250
Gregoire: I always find this lady on the first row.

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:41.081
Shri Mataji: What?
Gregoire: I always find these two ladies on the first row.

00:17:41.281 --> 00:17:45.594
They are following my bad example, Shri Mataji.

00:17:45.794 --> 00:17:51.180
Shri Mataji: I think you remove everything
from there, all that could be removed,

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:56.047
there is no need here, when we
need it we will get it from here, all right?

00:17:56.247 --> 00:18:01.247
Ah. That's better.

00:18:11.375 --> 00:18:17.800
Some put it here up to this point, some
people can come up to this point like that.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.234
This is the point up to this point, move it, move on.

00:18:40.577 --> 00:18:47.116
Just move forward, those who have not done puja before.

00:18:51.899 --> 00:18:59.899
Still move, like that you can move further, here. Yes,
yes move it, move it on. Yes, move it on. Yes, yes.

00:19:05.375 --> 00:19:10.088
Now let them have this, all
of this, can you sit all right,

00:19:10.288 --> 00:19:15.391
you can come here, I mean there
can be one row like that, yes, yes.

00:19:15.591 --> 00:19:23.591
Now you pass it on to everyone, take it, you
have to keep it in your hand, quite a lot.

00:19:24.496 --> 00:19:30.800
There are no categories, no?
They must not have bought some.

00:19:39.337 --> 00:19:44.923
To hold in the thing but there are no leaves
otherwise you can take these maple leaves, are all right?

00:19:45.123 --> 00:19:52.743
Take these maple leaves, yes, good idea,
in any case they are going to fall down.

00:19:53.876 --> 00:19:57.645
You can have some from there if you like.

00:19:57.845 --> 00:20:04.306
[Inaudible], can you get some big
maple leaves from there please?

00:20:07.447 --> 00:20:14.996
Leaves, on the leaves they can
keep it, keep it on the leaves, yes.

00:20:15.941 --> 00:20:20.941
Yes, it's better.

00:20:28.863 --> 00:20:32.143
Get some more leaves, possibly.

00:20:32.343 --> 00:20:39.588
Thomas be careful, I hope it
doesn't fall down on him just like.

00:20:48.157 --> 00:20:55.149
Gavin, come along, come here.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:02.400
You can remove this I think, yes.

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:08.340
Automa.

00:21:11.145 --> 00:21:17.297
Just, yeah yeah let her come, these peaches are [inaudible].

00:21:17.497 --> 00:21:23.075
Or she can come this way, yes, yeah, yeah.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:35.305
Just sit on the sides, Gavin, like that,
because you are not going to do anything,

00:21:35.505 --> 00:21:40.569
so you could face me now.

00:21:41.679 --> 00:21:45.400
You come this side, you come
this side, let us sit that side.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.172
Ha? Let her sit here.

00:21:48.372 --> 00:21:52.132
Gregoire: If Gavin can read it loud
enough, then he should do it.

00:21:52.332 --> 00:21:54.800
Shri Mataji: No, no, he should be here and read it loud.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.839
You give her the asana, I think she
has no asana to sit down, for Anita.

00:22:04.367 --> 00:22:10.992
Take this, please. It's all right.

00:22:12.164 --> 00:22:17.949
Leaves, on the leaves,
pass it on more to everyone.

00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:23.149
Gregoire: Can you pass on the leaves?

00:22:29.555 --> 00:22:34.555
Shri Mataji: Give some to Anita also.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:53.360
Yes, Thank you. No. that's all.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.597
So you look after that side, ha? All right.

00:22:58.797 --> 00:23:03.120
Now where is the camphor,
have you got camphor? All right.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:10.026
So now you can use a candle to light it, I
think,

00:23:10.226 --> 00:23:13.500
use the candle, so let's start it, Gavin.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:17.700
Gavin: Shri Ganesha's mantra.

00:24:58.992 --> 00:25:06.992
These are the seven essences he has described,
seven essences of the centers, the chakras.

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:16.300
Gavin: Now for lighting the fire, we take
the mantra of Shri Agni Devata.

00:25:54.148 --> 00:25:59.148
Let it twirl.

00:26:03.968 --> 00:26:07.773
Loudly. Because everybody should hear

00:26:07.973 --> 00:26:12.540
Gavin: Now we will say the mantras.
Yogi: Can't hear.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:22.747
Gavin: In each mantra we will say, Om Shri Mata,
or whatever name it is, namo namah and then Om...

00:26:22.948 --> 00:26:27.745
Shri Mataji: Can you all hear him?
Stand up. Therefore you say.

00:26:27.945 --> 00:26:31.776
Gregoire: Because his voice is not loud enough.
Shri Mataji: Not a loud speaker, yes.

00:26:31.976 --> 00:26:37.070
Gregoire: He has so many beautiful qualities but...

00:26:38.616 --> 00:26:40.617
Shri Mataji: All right.

00:26:40.817 --> 00:26:43.818
Gregoire: So I will just...

00:26:44.018 --> 00:26:46.625
So that my voice does not get cut.

00:26:46.825 --> 00:26:49.969
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, you are all right.
You have to say, doing God's work.

00:26:50.169 --> 00:26:53.216
Gregoire: So I'm going to say the name first.

00:26:53.416 --> 00:27:01.817
And then we say, Om Tvameva
Sakshat Shri, the name, Swaha.

00:27:02.231 --> 00:27:05.300
Is that correct?

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:11.065
So the first name is the one
that we all have in our heart.

00:27:11.265 --> 00:27:16.265
And this is Shri Mata.

00:27:26.054 --> 00:27:31.300
When we say Om Swaha we take this handful of
rice around our head and we offer it to the fire.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.416
Shri Mataji: All of you should do it also.

00:27:33.616 --> 00:27:38.999
Gregoire: We all do it even if
we don't have rice in our hand.

00:28:02.852 --> 00:28:08.294
And the rhythm is to be a bit more lively.

00:28:19.215 --> 00:28:26.363
Shri Mataji: What is this first name? [inaudible].

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:34.300
Shri Mataji: Correct.
Gregoire: Bhavani.

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:44.300
Nitya.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:55.300
Vishnu-granthi vibhedini

00:29:03.382 --> 00:29:08.253
Bhakti Priya.
Shri Mataji: Clockwise.

00:29:08.453 --> 00:29:12.453
No clockwise.

00:29:17.757 --> 00:29:22.905
Gregoire: Bhakti Gamya.
Shri Mataji: Clockwise.

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:33.634
Gregoire: Nirlepa.

00:29:39.859 --> 00:29:44.585
Sharma dayini.

00:29:51.703 --> 00:29:56.300
Niradhara.

00:30:02.718 --> 00:30:07.300
Niranjana.

00:30:13.159 --> 00:30:18.175
Maha-pataka nashini.

00:30:26.343 --> 00:30:30.819
Nirmala.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:40.914
Nirahankara.

Yogi: Well every quarter of a hour.

00:58:21.784 --> 00:58:24.200
Shri Mataji: I think we should start moving in anything.

00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:28.200
Gregoire: There is a point where you have a beautiful
view Shri Mataji which you wouldn't like to?

00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:33.571
Shri Mataji: No let them go and see the point. We can
go down. And then lunch here we will have it there.

00:58:33.772 --> 00:58:36.157
Gregoire:  No, lunch there is nothing organised, Shri Mataji.

00:58:36.358 --> 00:58:40.200
Because the program is topped with breakfast
so people will have to look for themselves.

00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:45.519
Shri Mataji: So what we can do is go to the airport we can get
some lunch all of us can have it. Those who are coming to the airport.

00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:51.394
Gregoire: Yes. One second [UNCLEAR].
Because Shri Mataji will now go down.

00:58:51.595 --> 00:59:00.417
Those who we still have quite some time and if you go up here there
is a beautiful point where you have the view over the whole thing.

00:59:00.618 --> 00:59:05.917
So you can perhaps stay half an hour or so around
and then Arno is going to tell you how it goes further.

00:59:06.118 --> 00:59:13.526
Shri Mataji: Because you see in one thing you cannot go you have
to take one after another and so some must start going down.

00:59:13.727 --> 00:59:16.219
Those who have seen it.

00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:22.568
Gregoire: Those who are in a hurry go first because we
cannot all go it will take some time before we all can go down.

00:59:22.769 --> 00:59:26.466
So you can look around if you
just go up here it is quite nice.

00:59:26.667 --> 00:59:33.190
And then we will go down. Those who go to
England then we can have eventually some kind of...

00:59:33.713 --> 00:59:36.460
late lunch in the airport in Zurich.

00:59:36.661 --> 00:59:40.768
The British flight is at four o'clock.

00:59:41.549 --> 00:59:43.716
The bus is leaving at one.

00:59:43.917 --> 00:59:49.917
So, well I mean people will wait but let's
try to be all down there by one one fifteen.

00:59:50.118 --> 00:59:54.352
Shri Mataji: You want to come to
me? All right, all right come along.

00:59:56.031 --> 01:00:00.414
Yes, come along. You want to come to Me?

01:00:02.516 --> 01:00:07.200
Gregoire: Where is the ticket of Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji, you have your ticket? Your plane ticket?

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:11.400
Shri Mataji: Yes, I have, I have. I have I'll...

01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:16.259
Gavin: We have little presents for new Sahaja Yogis. New Sahaja Yogis.

01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:21.200
Shri Mataji: There are a few things
we have to distribute before we go. So about 5, 10 minutes more.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:24.001
Gavin: For those who
have been less than one year.

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:28.915
Shri Mataji: She likes to be alone.

01:00:29.116 --> 01:00:32.892
Now, just bring the photographs,

01:00:33.337 --> 01:00:37.200
photographs you have got of mine.

01:00:37.743 --> 01:00:43.200
The photographs of Shri Ganesh and the tapes.

01:00:46.219 --> 01:00:49.320
There are tapes there.

01:00:51.009 --> 01:00:56.329
Gregoire: They are already distributed
Shri Mataji. They were distributed already. The Ganeshas.

01:00:56.530 --> 01:00:59.915
Shri Mataji: All right. Now this
we have got very beautiful music.

01:01:00.116 --> 01:01:04.631
I have not yet translated it but I will
translate made by Nasik Sahaja Yogis.

01:01:04.832 --> 01:01:11.160
If you want you can play if you have a tape
recorder. Start it, I may be able to tell you.

01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:15.753
Now this one is for...

01:01:15.953 --> 01:01:22.093
one we have given to whom did we give
to Holland. Now this is for Switzerland.

01:01:22.751 --> 01:01:26.801
Gregoire: Thank you very much, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Not you.

01:01:31.204 --> 01:01:34.353
Shri Mataji: From every country people should come here.

01:01:34.554 --> 01:01:37.554
Now one from...

01:01:44.267 --> 01:01:47.200
Ah say second country to tell [inaudible].

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:51.200
Gavin: Austria.
Shri Mataji: Austria.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Germany.

01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:01.579
Gavin: Germany.
Gregoire: Germany.

01:02:02.612 --> 01:02:05.574
Shri Mataji: You have got it? You have got this?

01:02:06.266 --> 01:02:09.659
I have given it. You have got this?

01:02:09.859 --> 01:02:14.363
Gavin: It's never there when we want it.
Shri Mataji: That will be the last.

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:17.564
France.

01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:26.106
[UNCLEAR] is not coming?
Gavin: Italy.

01:02:26.307 --> 01:02:30.025
Gregoire: No it's not coming.
Shri Mataji: Italy. It's not coming in that.

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:41.634
What else, now?
Gavin: Belgium.

01:02:41.835 --> 01:02:44.087
Shri Mataji: Yesterday?
Gavin: Belgium.

01:02:44.288 --> 01:02:47.423
Shri Mataji: Belgium I have given. Holland.

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:52.040
Gregoire: Holland.

01:03:01.148 --> 01:03:03.634
Shri Mataji: Spain. Have you got somebody from?

01:03:03.835 --> 01:03:06.343
Yogini: Yes, yes.
Yogis: Antonio?

01:03:06.544 --> 01:03:09.200
Shri Mataji: Antonio is here I never saw him.

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:12.923
That's why I never saw him.

01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:21.200
Very happy to see you here.
Antonio: Thank you very much.

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:25.200
Shri Mataji: May God bless you.
May God bless you. Yeah, good. Now?

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:28.220
Gavin: Greece.
Gregoire: Greece there is nobody.

01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:30.420
Gavin: Nobody come?

01:03:30.806 --> 01:03:35.200
Gregoire: There is [UNCLEAR].
Shri Mataji: We have not done.

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:39.200
Gregoire: How many Sahaja Yogis
are they going to be in Greece?

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:43.579
Yogis: 108!
Gregoire: 108.

01:03:53.842 --> 01:03:59.045
Shri Mataji: Australia.
Gavin: Australia. Mrs. Australia could take it.

01:04:01.865 --> 01:04:03.865
Denise.

01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:16.982
We have. From India,
no India I have given. India I have given.

01:04:17.183 --> 01:04:21.470
But it is from India actually. So what else?

01:04:21.681 --> 01:04:24.868
Argentina.

01:04:25.321 --> 01:04:27.866
Gregoire: Argentina.

01:04:28.464 --> 01:04:32.232
Shri Mataji: And Bolivia.
Everyone: Bolivia!

01:04:59.931 --> 01:05:02.595
Shri Mataji: May God bless
you. How are you feeling? Better?

01:05:02.796 --> 01:05:05.155
Yogi: Yes, yes very good.
Shri Mataji: You are all right?

01:05:05.356 --> 01:05:08.009
Yogi: Yes thank you very much.
Shri Mataji: I am happy.

01:05:09.181 --> 01:05:16.940
So that's how you must hear this. But the only problem is
that we can't hear it. It is very, very silent meditation I think.

01:05:18.345 --> 01:05:21.143
So what should we do? We can't hear it.

01:05:21.344 --> 01:05:25.273
Yogini: We took it already Shri Mataji. We
took the passport out already Shri Mataji.

01:05:25.474 --> 01:05:27.866
Gregoire: Maybe Shri
Mataji you cannot just...

01:05:28.066 --> 01:05:35.317
While we are all gathered here there are
some of us who are plotting to try to...

01:05:35.518 --> 01:05:39.032
We don't know whether it will work
out because it does not depend on us.

01:05:39.263 --> 01:05:46.370
We are trying perhaps to have a program,

01:05:46.570 --> 01:05:52.976
in Athens to have a Sahasrara Day in Delphi.

01:05:58.269 --> 01:06:02.656
Shri Mataji: In the Nabhi. Witness the Sahasrara in the Nabhi.

01:06:12.266 --> 01:06:15.389
From whom?
Child: From all the children.

01:06:15.590 --> 01:06:19.912
Shri Mataji: From all the children.

01:06:22.266 --> 01:06:24.986
Yogi: Shri Krishna.

01:06:25.187 --> 01:06:30.384
Shri Mataji: It's so beautiful.
Yogis: Awwwww.

01:06:37.570 --> 01:06:41.570
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.

01:06:42.843 --> 01:06:46.643
What an idea.

01:06:48.266 --> 01:06:52.412
Olympia, she wants you. That's a dolly baby.

01:06:52.613 --> 01:06:56.264
Gavin: Just to show you. Little tiny one as well.

01:06:56.465 --> 01:06:58.467
Shri Mataji: What's that?

01:06:58.668 --> 01:07:03.225
Gavin: That's for covering the cracks.
Shri Mataji: It's a tiny soul.

01:07:03.426 --> 01:07:06.449
Gregoire: This is for small boots, Shri Mataji.

01:07:08.266 --> 01:07:12.066
Shri Mataji: For mending. This is for building a house.

01:07:12.266 --> 01:07:17.511
For the foundation to be laid. In
India they give like this for a foundation.

01:07:24.023 --> 01:07:26.220
Gregoire: For the children.

01:07:26.421 --> 01:07:30.424
Shri Mataji: And this they give them
when they do the foundation in India.

01:07:30.625 --> 01:07:35.270
For foundation ceremony.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

01:07:35.471 --> 01:07:40.066
Yes? Yes? Yes? Yes?
Yes? You want to come to me?

01:07:44.826 --> 01:07:47.826
Look at this joy.

01:07:54.627 --> 01:07:57.331
Hello. Thank you very much.

01:07:57.532 --> 01:08:03.049
Gavin: This is for the new Sahaja Yogis Mother, one or other of those.
Shri Mataji: For the new Sahaja Yogis one by one. Come along.

01:08:04.690 --> 01:08:07.682
Gregoire: Are you new?
Gavin: One year in Sahaja.

01:08:07.883 --> 01:08:10.049
Shri Mataji: One year, just pass it on.
Yogi: One year?

01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:12.791
Shri Mataji: Take it from Gavin.

01:08:17.432 --> 01:08:20.066
What an idea.

01:08:20.266 --> 01:08:23.318
Gregoire: One per person.
Gavin: Yes? One of either which ever they like.

01:08:23.519 --> 01:08:25.989
Gregoire: One of either.
Gavin: Or there some come from.

01:08:26.190 --> 01:08:32.403
Shri Mataji: What a beautiful piece, huh? This
is from the south. From Kerala. It's beautiful.

01:08:32.604 --> 01:08:38.119
Yogi: Do you give it to Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: No. I didn't say for that.

01:08:41.135 --> 01:08:44.066
It's too beautiful.
Gregoire: One thing per person.

01:08:44.266 --> 01:08:48.842
Shri Mataji: He has from the museum.
So very beautiful. May God bless you.

01:08:49.043 --> 01:08:52.297
Who is this one? There?

01:08:53.258 --> 01:08:56.066
Who are?

01:08:57.851 --> 01:08:59.651
Where did you get it?

01:08:59.852 --> 01:09:05.336
Yogi: This is Andre.
Yogini: The names are all here. The name are here, Mother.

01:09:11.375 --> 01:09:14.375
Shri Mataji: All right. Thank you
very much. Thank you very much.

01:09:14.576 --> 01:09:18.062
Give it to Gavin, he has to carry [inaudible].

01:09:18.267 --> 01:09:21.617
Lots of things to be carried, you know.

01:09:21.818 --> 01:09:25.999
Yogi: Shri Mataji? Shri Mataji?
When we did the account.

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:32.263
After paying everything.
We are left with 7000 Franks!

01:09:50.752 --> 01:09:56.509
Gregoire: I cannot throw it on this side.
Shri Mataji: Come along, come along. Come along.

01:10:18.266 --> 01:10:22.383
Gregoire: Shri Mataji, This is from the English. I am told, I don't know what it is.
Shri Mataji: From the English, what's happening?

01:10:22.584 --> 01:10:25.344
Gregoire: Gavin, this is from the English? I heard.

01:10:25.545 --> 01:10:28.601
Gavin: It's from some English, yes.
Christine, you better come and explain.

01:10:28.802 --> 01:10:32.066
Shri Mataji: What is that?

01:10:32.266 --> 01:10:35.617
What is this from the English? What's that?

01:10:36.266 --> 01:10:38.066
Yogi: This is the cloud!

01:10:39.453 --> 01:10:41.422
This is the cloud!

01:10:46.703 --> 01:10:49.564
Gregoire: Okay. Who else? One year.

01:10:49.764 --> 01:10:53.664
Shri Mataji: See these are the signs. These are the
signs of the vibrations. You see they are forming now.

01:10:53.864 --> 01:10:57.396
See the clouds are forming. Can you see?

01:10:58.131 --> 01:11:01.139
That is the sign of vibrations.

01:11:01.935 --> 01:11:04.065
How they are forming?

01:11:17.878 --> 01:11:21.596
And the two sides of the spinal cord.

01:11:26.878 --> 01:11:29.901
How Beautiful.

01:11:30.729 --> 01:11:33.096
Like the fold of a sari.

01:11:48.266 --> 01:11:50.887
So the clouds have come.

01:11:51.364 --> 01:11:54.942
Christine: This is from England. It is handblown artistry.
Shri Mataji: From where?

01:11:55.143 --> 01:12:00.525
Christine: It is from London, made in London.
Shri Mataji: Really? You have got it in London.

01:12:00.726 --> 01:12:03.712
Christine: Of course it is in glass but we...
Shri Mataji: It is painted?

01:12:03.913 --> 01:12:09.587
Christine: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Beautiful isn't it. Such a beautiful thing.

01:12:10.665 --> 01:12:15.274
They have done it in glass. So beautiful.
Christine: It is handmade in London.

01:12:15.475 --> 01:12:18.336
Shri Mataji: Is it a real conch or a glass?
Christine: Glass, crystal.

01:12:18.537 --> 01:12:22.774
Shri Mataji: Glass, crystal.
Just imagine. What a beautiful piece.

01:12:22.975 --> 01:12:27.373
I'll have to take a stand in India for
that. What a beautiful. Thank you very much.

01:12:27.574 --> 01:12:30.066
From the English.

01:12:30.266 --> 01:12:33.416
Gregoire: Shri Mataji, this is from
Venice. So that Venice can be blessed.

01:12:33.616 --> 01:12:36.969
It is brought by the
Sahaja Yogi from Milano.

01:12:37.170 --> 01:12:39.851
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.
Gregoire: She brought it.

01:12:40.367 --> 01:12:44.367
From Anna, from Milano.
Shri Mataji: Thank you, thank you very much.

01:12:44.568 --> 01:12:48.240
And this one Gavin, Gavin. This is another thing.

01:12:49.163 --> 01:12:51.342
Hello!

01:12:51.819 --> 01:12:55.694
Gregoire: This is from the video crew,
Shri Mataji, I don't. From the video crew.

01:12:55.895 --> 01:12:58.965
Shri Mataji: Video?
Gregoire: Crew?
Shri Mataji: Crew.

01:12:59.166 --> 01:13:02.480
Gregoire: The group who looks after the video.
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.

01:13:02.681 --> 01:13:07.316
Now, this is Anitha.

01:13:08.887 --> 01:13:12.597
Gregoire: Could you please be
seated so everybody will have a chance?

01:13:12.798 --> 01:13:15.238
I'm sorry, I give the bad example.

01:13:15.801 --> 01:13:21.152
You saw the children in Rome.
Shri Mataji: You reach [inaudible] Rome.

01:13:21.352 --> 01:13:26.195
They are really [UNCLEAR].
Gregoire: This is Pandit Bhimsen Joshi in Hounslow, this.

01:13:26.396 --> 01:13:30.672
Pandit Bhimsen Joshi in Hounslow. He sang before.

01:13:33.852 --> 01:13:36.066
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.

01:13:36.266 --> 01:13:40.066
This one Gavin is Pandit Bhimsen Joshi in Hounslow.

01:13:40.267 --> 01:13:42.906
Warren: That's a lovely concert.
Gavin: It's a beautiful concert.

01:13:43.107 --> 01:13:47.114
Shri Mataji: Beautiful.
Bhimsen was in the seventh heaven.

01:14:01.034 --> 01:14:06.065
Just a Gavin to have to bring all these things.

01:14:28.743 --> 01:14:31.828
Shri Mataji: Very independent, very indepentdent.

01:14:32.029 --> 01:14:35.657
Now what are you doing? No, no, no. [Inaudible].

01:14:35.858 --> 01:14:40.774
You can't do that to your
mother. Then she will go away. No.

01:14:41.774 --> 01:14:44.336
She want you to take out the food? All right.

01:14:51.664 --> 01:14:54.219
Gregoire: Why don't you give
the full staff once it is ready?

01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:59.023
Shri Mataji: All right, give me the proper one.
Gregoire: Not the first draft, the full staff.

01:15:00.445 --> 01:15:04.969
Sorry, but I have reactions of bureaucrats. First draft.
Yogini: That's all right sir.

01:15:09.808 --> 01:15:13.144
Shri Mataji: Actually we have
beyond time people, so be careful.

01:15:19.359 --> 01:15:21.637
Be on time.

01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:27.218
You have to wear the shoes. My shoes are here.

01:15:28.632 --> 01:15:34.085
This one you must collect
when it is done. Very important.

01:15:49.337 --> 01:15:54.066
Yogi: Shri Mataji, should we collect
the ashes and put it on the [UNCLEAR].

01:15:54.485 --> 01:15:57.680
Shri Mataji: Of course, you should.

01:16:08.466 --> 01:16:12.266
That's a one-man show. If he's
finished everything will be finished.

01:16:12.466 --> 01:16:14.266
But you can't get back the money, I think.

01:16:14.466 --> 01:16:17.782
Should we put it in the?

01:16:18.172 --> 01:16:21.983
Yogi: We'll put it in the
lake, Mother. It will go in the lake.

01:16:22.183 --> 01:16:24.466
Shri Mataji: All right, I'll take this.

01:16:40.723 --> 01:16:44.074
Shall we end up in a very good mood now.

01:16:45.264 --> 01:16:48.159
I hope to see you for Diwali Puja.

01:16:59.091 --> 01:17:05.380
Wait, wait because there's a case on, so better let him
die after this so he'll take the money to those people.

01:17:07.926 --> 01:17:11.716
Mark Griffinsore also we should get money.

01:17:11.917 --> 01:17:17.560
Gregoire: Shri Mataji also said that she hope to see
all of us in Diwali Puja which will take place in Rome.

01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:21.597
Thank you Guido for organising all this and...

01:17:21.798 --> 01:17:24.364
Yogis: When? When?

01:17:25.661 --> 01:17:28.266
Gavin: 17th weekend, after Diwali?

01:17:29.973 --> 01:17:33.200
Shri Mataji: November 17th.
Gregoire: November 17th in Rome!

01:17:39.103 --> 01:17:43.238
Boy: What is daddy saying? What is daddy saying?

01:17:43.438 --> 01:17:46.265
Shri Mataji: He is saying we are going to have [UNCLEAR] thrown out!

01:17:46.466 --> 01:17:49.664
In Rome you are all going to come there.

01:17:50.466 --> 01:17:54.234
Put it in the swaha.
Gregoire: Put it in the fire.

01:18:05.319 --> 01:18:08.624
We have forgotten this.
And the house would be also om swaha?

01:18:08.825 --> 01:18:12.178
Shri Mataji: What this?
Gregoire: The house? Om swaha?
Shri Mataji: The house is all right.

01:18:17.666 --> 01:18:21.466
Where are this shoes? They're there.

01:18:21.667 --> 01:18:23.667
Yeah?

01:18:24.446 --> 01:18:26.719
Who's shoes are these?

01:18:30.571 --> 01:18:34.466
His shoes are here. These little shoes?
Yogini: Yes.

01:18:37.008 --> 01:18:40.138
Yogi: Oh yes, here they are.
Shri Mataji: I found them.

01:18:40.339 --> 01:18:42.705
Yogi: Thank you, Mother.
Gregoire: Incredible, huh?

01:18:42.906 --> 01:18:47.335
Shri Mataji: So hello. You don't like me because?

01:18:48.079 --> 01:18:52.466
What's she say?
She'll go herself. [inaudible].

01:18:53.135 --> 01:18:55.135
Correct.

01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:06.466
So very soon now then.

01:19:12.119 --> 01:19:16.028
So next holiday we'll enjoy in Rome.

01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:19.481
Make holiday in Rome.

01:22:08.970 --> 01:22:13.016
We are not in India,
very difficult [UNCLEAR]. Catching by [UNCLEAR].

01:22:13.454 --> 01:22:16.466
See this is the western country.

01:22:16.666 --> 01:22:20.466
They won't like it.
They don't like it here.

01:22:20.666 --> 01:22:24.466
That's only in India we can do
it. Everything we do, they like it.

01:22:24.666 --> 01:22:28.658
They enjoy it. They have respect for it.

01:22:28.859 --> 01:22:31.697
We are insulting their faith.

01:22:31.898 --> 01:22:37.541
But we get drugged or alcoholic, that's not faith.

01:22:38.376 --> 01:22:45.344
They have to change this idea. By our very
sane behavior according to their standards.

01:22:45.544 --> 01:22:50.391
Gregoire:...but the place is.
Shri Mataji: The about mountains [UNCLEAR]?

01:22:56.066 --> 01:22:58.813
Yogis: [UNCLEAR]!
Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR].

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:10.866
I can't [UNCLEAR].

01:23:13.617 --> 01:23:17.461
I start moving, it's a mystery to Me too.

01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:23.871
Bye-bye.
Yogis: Bye-bye.

01:23:24.072 --> 01:23:26.652
Shri Mataji: Bye-bye.

01:23:29.566 --> 01:23:31.866
Hope to hear the good news very soon.

01:23:33.604 --> 01:23:36.363
Bye-bye.
Yogi: Bye-bye Shri Mataji.

01:23:39.066 --> 01:23:40.866
Shri Mataji: May God Bless - bye bye!

01:23:41.066 --> 01:23:42.866
Children: Bye bye!

01:23:43.066 --> 01:23:47.984
Shri Mataji: Bye bye!
Bye bye! Bye bye! Bye.

01:23:48.344 --> 01:23:51.344
Bye bye! Bye bye!

01:23:54.761 --> 01:23:56.561
Bye bye!

01:23:56.762 --> 01:23:58.613
Yogis: Bye bye.

01:23:58.814 --> 01:24:00.866
Gregoire: Western style!

01:24:01.066 --> 01:24:03.676
Shri Mataji: Bye bye!

01:24:10.151 --> 01:24:12.644
Extremely [UNCLEAR].
