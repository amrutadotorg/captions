00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So we are just going to say a few things and then I think everybody can ask questions very simply.

2
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So who starts?

3
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Can you hear me?

4
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Can you tell us what happened to Vlodia?

5
00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I think that Satya Yuga will come when the greatest spiritual master in the world will meet a great world leader.

6
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So then we had quite a maya with Mihail Gorbachev.

7
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Mihail Gorbachev is realized.

8
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And she wanted to meet him.

9
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And she wrote to him, she explained to him what should be done in Russia.

10
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And now something a little bit tragic happened.

11
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Because instead of meeting the true spiritual leader, Gorbachev met some false prophet.

12
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:15.000
He met a Chin Nowai, who is sort of a guru in New York, who, you know, it's a joke.

13
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:28.000
He met a Reverend Moon who is a Christian fake guru from Korea.

14
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So the path of auspiciousness which was foreseen then got blocked.

15
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And then very rapidly everything turned upside down.

16
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
You know what happened to Gorbachev?

17
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Then you have Yeltsin.

18
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And, you know, Yeltsin was corrupt.

19
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So, you know, sometimes there are moments in history which are changing the course and then we need to live with it.

20
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So I don't want to spend too much time, but I think Shrimataji had this vision, really, that after communism and capitalism, the societies here could show another way for the world.

21
00:03:48.000 --> 00:04:04.000
But as you know, the Saja Yoga in Russia has been almost destroyed. It was the largest, largest collectivity outside of India.

22
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And then they had a number of problems which I'm not going to discuss. And then, you know, the power of that collectivity was affected.

23
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And even here, you were one thousand people in Kiev. How many are you? 300? 400? You have been melting like snow in the sunshine.

24
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:48.000
So there has been an attack of negativity.

25
00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So we need to regroup and then we will attack with our weapons which are different.

26
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:20.000
These are the Sarvastradayini. She is the one who gives all the weapons.

27
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Sarva means all, astra means weapon. The one who gives all the weapons. So that's one name. Maybe we can take this name together.

28
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:42.000
So, Sri Sarvastradayini.

29
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Shrimataji Shri Nirmala Devi Nanno Nana.

30
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Just when you require mentions the weapons, a thought came into my mind. I had a short interaction with Vladimir this morning about the soul and also about the speech this morning about the different nadis in the body.

31
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:18.000
I thought that our weapons are sometimes of a very gentle nature as well.

32
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And I have to confess I missed the morning meditation in the beginning.

33
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Because I slept so well here.

34
00:07:39.000 --> 00:08:02.000
But then when Vladimir told me about the talk this morning, I remembered that there is a talk where Shrimataji mentions four nadis and one of them is the Amruta Nadi.

35
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Amruta means the nectar which falls from above. I personally, as probably many of you, I really love this aspect of Sahaja Yoga.

36
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And we can definitely consider this Amruta as a weapon.

37
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:59.000
If I may speak as a doctor a little bit here, what happens when this Amruta falls on us?

38
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:09.000
It obviously falls from a region above the Sahasrara.

39
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And from above the Sahasrara.

40
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Eventually, Shrimataji explains the Sahasrara chakra. There are always two aspects. One is the limbic area.

41
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And the other is the way the Sahasrara unfolds like a flower or like a palm tree. Many many nadis are spreading out.

42
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:55.000
So these nadis that are spreading out, they end, medically speaking, in an area which we call the cortex of the brain.

43
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
The cortex of the brain.

44
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:07.000
The nadi is the area that is spreading out. And the cortex of the brain is the cortex of the brain.

45
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:18.000
And that cortex of the brain, I'm not going into details medically, besides the fact that I don't know them myself so well.

46
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And I don't know if you know the details of the brain.

47
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.000
But in that brain cortex, most of our mental activities take place.

48
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:41.000
And all our reactions are taking place, our mental reactions.

49
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And then these mental reactions, somehow they connect to the lower part of the brain, which is the limbic area, where the emotional reactions take place.

50
00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:11.000
So when the vibrations, which you can call as ambros, also falls on our brain, they saturate first the cortex.

51
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And I would say here, I mean, one of the real beauties of Sahaj meditation takes place, because what happens is an orchestration, an orchestration of the activity of the Divine on the individual.

52
00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:08.000
The reason why we can feel so good sometimes, just by coming, I mean, even we were talking about it, when we came here, we came in the hall first, you sit ten minutes, you're feeling so good.

53
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:16.000
In the puja, you're feeling so good. This morning, besides missing the meditation, we just came in here, we felt so good.

54
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And when we came here, we felt so good. We just came in here, we felt so good.

55
00:12:51.000 --> 00:13:12.000
And this, that cortex, that explains to me as a doctor how we can feel so good, because on the further path down towards the limbic area, there is this integration of all our functions, of the brain functions, and that's why we are feeling so good.

56
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:20.000
I would like to add Pollinivivratie to the body organics at a good level, and its••••ion here at the

57
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:27.000
own time, but immediately something else. Please do not go away because we see such an amazing.

58
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
As talked about recently it is not in snacks.

59
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
But, if I may...

60
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
this was a spontaneous input for the thought when collapsing of talking.

61
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.480
And I might give him the mic back.

62
00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:46.800
And I think he has a few corrections to make.

63
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.300
Ha.

64
00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:51.780
Do you think that the water is a good thing?

65
00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:57.300
No, it's just vibration and I'm good, there is a difference.

66
00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.780
Do you think that the water is a good thing?

67
00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.100
Cloud is water.

68
00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.300
And the water is water.

69
00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.300
And the river is water.

70
00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.300
And the water is good.

71
00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:14.300
When we feel good in Puja, we feel the cloud.

72
00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.300
Because it's a gaseous state, condition.

73
00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:22.300
So vibrations are like, you know, like the cloud.

74
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.300
But Amrut is like the river.

75
00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.300
But Amrut is like the river.

76
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.300
It's...

77
00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.300
Okay, just don't let me say that.

78
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.300
It's okay.

79
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.300
We are really lucky to have Karigwe with us.

80
00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.300
I'm very happy with you.

81
00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:14.300
When Vladimir gave us notice that this seminar is happening

82
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.300
and he sent us his sweet invitation,

83
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:22.300
there was not even a moment of thinking if coming, if we should come or not.

84
00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:26.300
We are very happy with the seminar.

85
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:33.300
We are very happy with the moment of thinking.

86
00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:39.300
With so much, all of us recalled the wonderful Christmas Puja we had here

87
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:46.300
and the meditative experience of complete silence in the head that we had in Ukraine.

88
00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:01.300
It's such a quality that the yogis of this country reflect.

89
00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:09.300
And sometimes we are facing difficulties which might be very big difficulties

90
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.300
and we might think that we are not able to overcome them.

91
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.300
And just now you were in such a moment.

92
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:30.300
And I recall a moment when Rego was also there and many others.

93
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:36.300
When we were completely desperate about the development that Sahaja Yoga took

94
00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.300
and this was in Pune in 2007.

95
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.300
It was around Easter Puja, she Jesus Christ.

96
00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:03.300
And we all were really desperate.

97
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.300
And there was no solution on the horizon.

98
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.300
Shrimadaji had stopped talking a couple of years ago.

99
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.300
And things went really wrong.

100
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:29.300
And in that moment of complete desperation, all of a sudden we were in Bratishna

101
00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.300
and Shrimadaji was in her room.

102
00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:36.300
And all of a sudden we hear her voice in her room.

103
00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:59.300
While we were just discussing things in a hopeless situation about the Darshan school.

104
00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:11.300
All of a sudden somebody came out of the room of Shrimadaji and called her scene

105
00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.300
and the person was really really excited.

106
00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:27.300
And when we came inside, Shrimadaji sat there in full splendor, very joyful

107
00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:31.300
and telling us, just give me the plans, give me the plans of Darshan.

108
00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:47.300
And she talked to us, she cracked jokes with us as if she had never stopped talking before.

109
00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.300
We were using so many handkerchiefs.

110
00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:08.300
She can come back in any form, at any moment, in any situation.

111
00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:17.300
And this was a resurrection of Easter.

112
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:34.300
And then in the evening she said, better people don't go home for the puja because they should stay for the puja.

113
00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.300
And at the end of this puja she gave her half an hour speech.

114
00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:56.300
She was addressing and said, I know you would have liked to achieve much more and things did not work the way you wanted.

115
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:14.300
And then she gave us a lot of advice and the main thing which I want to talk about now is that at the end she said,

116
00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.300
your desire is going to work it out.

117
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.300
Your desire is going to work it out.

118
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:44.300
And now we are in such a situation.

119
00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:55.300
And yesterday when Gregor gave his speech pointing out all the details,

120
00:20:55.300 --> 00:21:05.300
drawing a visual map of every situation in such a clear way, the desire manifested.

121
00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:18.300
And now we are in such a situation where we are in such a situation where we are in such a clear way.

122
00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:57.300
And when we had our meditation after that, when we meditated on the heart, I felt the pain in your heart.

123
00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:10.300
And tears were coming from my eyes.

124
00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:16.300
And this went into the ether.

125
00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:26.300
And when at the end of the meditation we were in absolute silence, united, completely one, this went into the ether.

126
00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:45.300
And when yesterday in the puja we were enjoying the music and complete joy, Aladha Dayan.

127
00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:52.300
That's the name of shrimadaji. When we were enjoying this complete joy, this went into the ether.

128
00:22:52.300 --> 00:23:08.300
Aladha Dayan is one of the names of Shrimadaji, gives the complete joy.

129
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.300
And this all goes into the ether.

130
00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:29.300
So whenever we come together as Sahaja Yogis, we create such a collective power which is heard by the Divine.

131
00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:42.300
And when we are in such a situation where we are in such a situation where we are in such a state of silence, we create such a pure desire.

132
00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:50.300
And this pure desire is heard by the Divine.

133
00:23:50.300 --> 00:24:01.300
And if you are sitting there in the last row, very much in the back, your desire is heard by the Divine.

134
00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.300
She will listen to what you pray.

135
00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:22.300
And it's one thing to know about it and it's the other thing as Gregor El so nicely explained is to completely trust.

136
00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:35.300
And the faith above the aagya is shraddha.

137
00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:43.300
We just know that Mother will take care of it.

138
00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:54.300
And this is how we operate on the level that dear Gregor has described yesterday, on the level that is above.

139
00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:04.300
This is when we use our yogic powers.

140
00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:13.300
So we have to be careful with the desire.

141
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:24.300
And Gregor is having a nice surprise for you to lead a meditation at the end.

142
00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:29.300
I think he is going to play a bit with this pure power of desire.

143
00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:45.300
But one thing that impressed me very much about Ukraine was you have these two boxers, Klitschko.

144
00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.300
And they are really good.

145
00:25:55.300 --> 00:26:01.300
I mean one is not boxing anymore, he is a politician. I don't know how he works as a politician but he was a good boxer.

146
00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:15.300
And they were fighting so many great fighters.

147
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:23.300
And they got punched in the face and everywhere so many times.

148
00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:32.300
And their mother of course did not like it but she could bear it.

149
00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:40.300
But she could never bear it if their own sons fight each other.

150
00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:48.300
So she took the promise, never fight against each other.

151
00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:55.300
And they kept to the promise.

152
00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:04.300
Let our desire go in this direction that we never have to fight any brother or sister.

153
00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:18.300
And the divine will clearly accept the opportunity.

154
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:34.300
I just wanted to compliment one thing about this speech at East Puzha.

155
00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:42.300
That Wolfgang has mentioned.

156
00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.300
Because it was extraordinary.

157
00:27:49.300 --> 00:28:01.300
She said, as he said, she said, I know that you had expected, you had wished to achieve much more.

158
00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:16.300
And then she said something like, but if there are all these difficulties it is because I want you to become perfect.

159
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:28.300
There is a little problem with the yogis when everything goes well.

160
00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:37.300
When everything goes well the yogis are on picnic mode.

161
00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:45.300
They are on cruise control.

162
00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:56.300
Life is a nice party and the lila goes on and we all enjoy.

163
00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:06.300
And with this we do not transform.

164
00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.300
Because we are just carried by the blessing.

165
00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:16.300
That we don't transform.

166
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:23.300
So to oblige us to be in perspective.

167
00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.300
To oblige us to witness.

168
00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.300
To oblige me to see my own imperfection.

169
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.300
Otherwise I am going to test me.

170
00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.300
Otherwise I am very lazy yogi.

171
00:29:53.300 --> 00:30:00.300
I was telling a sister from India that, you know, when I do my food show my wife is preparing my food show.

172
00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.300
Otherwise she knows I am not going to food show.

173
00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:06.300
I am from India and I am going to food show.

174
00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:10.300
So I am very happy that I am going to food show.

175
00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:15.300
But when things are tough I prepare my food show myself.

176
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.300
But I am not going to food show myself.

177
00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.300
I am going to food show myself.

178
00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:23.300
So just to give you the idea.

179
00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.300
Don't be fanatics please.

180
00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.300
And don't be fanatics.

181
00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:34.300
Don't go on shubhi, don't go on doing haban.

182
00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:37.300
Otherwise you will do many haban with little power.

183
00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:49.300
Do a few haban with big power.

184
00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:54.300
If you want to make a difference.

185
00:30:55.300 --> 00:31:04.300
And in the meeting don't give bandhan, don't shubhi, don't just meditate and transform and reach the top of the triangle.

186
00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:07.300
This is tough but the only thing we have to do.

187
00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.300
I think we are good.

188
00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:32.300
Do you have a question?

189
00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:36.300
Do you have any questions for Zars?

190
00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:39.300
Or do you want to ask Zars?

191
00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:45.300
The generation of the bandhan and haban is very different.

192
00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:50.300
We are not going to do any bandhan and haban.

193
00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:53.300
So what we need is bandhan and haban.

194
00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:57.300
If we are here then we don't really need any bandhan and haban.

195
00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.300
Yes, you don't.

196
00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.300
If you are here you don't.

197
00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.300
You see but many people think they are here but they are here.

198
00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:24.300
Then they need the bandhan and they need the haban.

199
00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:30.300
It's just we should not be too systematic.

200
00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.300
Nothing too much.

201
00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.300
Havan is good, bandhan is good.

202
00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:43.300
But never too much.

203
00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:48.300
Do you have any questions?

204
00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:50.300
I have no questions.

205
00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:00.300
In 2008, Shri Mataji gave a Shri Guru Guru speech

206
00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:05.300
and She told that you all have become Gurus now.

207
00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:08.300
I have no questions.

208
00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:10.300
I have no questions.

209
00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:12.300
I have no questions.

210
00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:15.300
I want to ask you a question.

211
00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.300
Yes, please.

212
00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:34.300
Everybody was really happy and whenever you tried to say anything to anybody you heard I am my Guru.

213
00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:45.300
People started divorcing the marriage.

214
00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:50.300
I have no questions.

215
00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:52.300
I have no questions.

216
00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.300
I have no questions.

217
00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:59.300
People did not come for collective meditation because at home the vibrations are much better.

218
00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:01.300
I am my Guru.

219
00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:03.300
I have no questions.

220
00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:05.300
I have no questions.

221
00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:07.300
I have no questions.

222
00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:09.300
I have no questions.

223
00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.300
I have no questions.

224
00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:15.300
A part of the speech which is not quoted that often is

225
00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:20.300
and the one who said that he is my Guru, I have no questions.

226
00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:27.300
Shri Mataji said you have to feel cool on your hands and on your head all the time.

227
00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.300
I have no questions.

228
00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:32.300
I am not a Guru.

229
00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.300
I am not a Guru.

230
00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:36.300
I am a Guru.

231
00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.300
Then you are your Guru.

232
00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.300
I am not a Guru.

233
00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:44.300
So let us rather come for feeling cool all the time.

234
00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:49.300
And let us rather come for feeling cool all the time.

235
00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:52.300
Now I am your Guru.

236
00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:54.300
I am your Guru.

237
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:56.300
I am your Guru.

238
00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.300
I have no questions for you.

239
00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.300
I am your Guru.

240
00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:02.300
I will speak to you in a minute.

241
00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.300
One more question.

242
00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:11.300
Why isn't anything said about the importance of giving realization?

243
00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.300
In self realization, spreading realization.

244
00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:22.300
Because it is obvious.

245
00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:39.300
I am not talking about things which are obvious.

246
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:49.300
I am not talking about things which are obvious.

247
00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:59.300
I am not talking about things which are obvious.

248
00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:11.300
I am talking about things which are obvious.

249
00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:20.300
So we spoke about the vibrations, about the importance of feeling the vibrations in the form of the knowing kind.

250
00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:27.300
But sometimes vibrations are different and sometimes they seem or they are not in fact.

251
00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.300
And is there any negativity in this case?

252
00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:41.300
Can there be any negativity in the case of cool vibrations?

253
00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:46.300
I think here what comes into play here is the Hamza Chakra.

254
00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:49.300
It is about discrimination.

255
00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:55.300
I mean it is a very important center which is placed directly under the hagya.

256
00:36:55.300 --> 00:37:08.300
And in thoughtless awareness when we address a situation we do get a clear answer.

257
00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:15.300
If the vibrations are pure vibrations that is what I would say. That is my own practice.

258
00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:22.300
In the beginning of Saja Yoga there were leaders who were taking vibrations all the time.

259
00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:49.300
Today they are no longer in Saja Yoga.

260
00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:59.300
The vibrations are not a GPS system.

261
00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:08.300
You can, if you try to use vibration and you are not at the level of innocence

262
00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:14.300
because you use vibration for your own purpose with a limited mind

263
00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:17.300
then the maya can cheat you through the vibration.

264
00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:33.300
Again, otherwise it would be too simple.

265
00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:37.300
You don't transform, you don't improve but with the vibration you are always okay.

266
00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:42.300
No, the vibration will not be an alternative to transforming.

267
00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:57.300
If everybody feels the same thing then it is fine.

268
00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:06.300
If you take vibrations, some people feel this cold, some people feel this hot

269
00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:13.300
then you need to use your buddhi because buddhi can be vibrated.

270
00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:17.300
Buddhi is enlightened intelligence, discrimination.

271
00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:34.300
In some countries they can't seem to take vibrations.

272
00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:45.300
And the elected complete idiots.

273
00:39:56.300 --> 00:40:03.300
So again, you know, it is inside. No methodology, no system can work.

274
00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:10.300
Not even vibration. If we are where we are inside on our sushuna then it works.

275
00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:26.300
When Shri Mataji withdrew you had some people who started writing procedures.

276
00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:38.300
Procedures for electing council.

277
00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:44.300
Every council must rotate every three years.

278
00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:55.300
You know, procedures and regulations are for non-yogis.

279
00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:02.300
Yogis use their discrimination.

280
00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:11.300
Is leadership bad or good?

281
00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:18.300
Good leadership is good but leadership is bad.

282
00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:27.300
But if you say leadership is bad, what about Shri Mataji?

283
00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:39.300
So, don't believe in rules and regulations.

284
00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:47.300
He has younger brothers who started being important, writing 12 pages of procedures

285
00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:54.300
and I am working with United Nations, I knew what procedures are, I am using it for my job.

286
00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:09.300
I am working with the government and the government is working with the government.

287
00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:16.300
But I am working with the government and I know what procedures are.

288
00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:37.300
Reaction, witnessing, not reacting, meditating and transforming.

289
00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:44.300
And the procedure and the process of the process are very important.

290
00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:47.300
You must be able to do it.

291
00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:49.300
But you need to be able to do it.

292
00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:54.300
And you need to be able to do it in an introspective way.

293
00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:57.300
You need to be able to do it in a real way.

294
00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:01.300
If you want to rotate your council, you rotate.

295
00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:05.300
But if the council works well, let it work.

296
00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:07.300
What is the problem?

297
00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:20.300
I think rotation is a good thing because it's like the air circulates.

298
00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:29.300
But it doesn't need to be three years fixed.

299
00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:34.300
No, for a big country it's one thing, for a small country it's different.

300
00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.300
But it's not the same as a small country.

301
00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:39.300
It's a very small country.

302
00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:42.300
It's a very small country.

303
00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:48.300
So, I will just say a little piece about what was important.

304
00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:57.300
First of all, when you have a big, big, big, big, big,

305
00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:00.300
you have to be able to do it in a real way.

306
00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:02.300
You have to do it in a real way.

307
00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:04.300
It's a very small country.

308
00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:07.300
But we can do it in a real way without a GPS.

309
00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:09.300
Especially with sensor shifts.

310
00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:14.300
It's hard to do, but it's generally a good thing.

311
00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.300
Anyone?

312
00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.300
As for time?

313
00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:27.300
So, what aspects of Ukraine do we have?

314
00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:49.300
It's about reading the mantras with Sri or without Sri, because lately in Ukraine we start to read all the mantras with Sri, regardless which kind of name it is.

315
00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:55.300
Yeah, they mean mistakes in the mantra book.

316
00:44:55.300 --> 00:45:21.300
Which we now are correcting, because they started taking out Sri before many names, which were for instance the one who destroyed sin, Papahari, they were taking away the Sri.

317
00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:39.300
No, what Mother Tod has is you don't say Sri before the name of the rakshasa.

318
00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:52.300
Only before the name of the rakshasa.

319
00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:56.300
Those are the names where she kills, with the very notion.

320
00:45:56.300 --> 00:46:08.300
The question is, where to keep the attention?

321
00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:24.300
At the Sahasrara or Papad?

322
00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:32.300
I think the question is a good catapult into meditation. Thank you.

323
00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:41.300
I don't understand why you are saying that you are not catapulting the whole country.

324
00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:53.300
I am not catapulting the whole country, but I am saying how meditation takes place in your countries.

325
00:46:53.300 --> 00:47:03.300
Can I respond more seriously to the question? Because there is a more serious response.

326
00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:21.300
If you put attention in your Sahasrara, it is still your Sahasrara.

327
00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:40.300
If you put your attention a little bit higher, what is yours?

328
00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:52.300
So you come closer to collective consciousness.

329
00:47:52.300 --> 00:48:04.300
What about the question how meditation takes place in your countries?

330
00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:16.300
I think every country has its own qualities. And according to the qualities, the quality of meditation is like yesterday.

331
00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:28.300
And also today, here we can feel extreme silence, which is apparently a great quality that you have developed.

332
00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:48.320
But the reality is that you can feel even more Self-emis somebody else's their might and1 and take their own

333
00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:57.000
I must say we are lucky in our country is that by tradition we frequently lead in bigger

334
00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.120
groups to meditate.

335
00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:17.120
At some point, Shri Mataji was always pleased when we had ashrams.

336
00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:30.360
And in Austria at some point we have more than 20 ashrams.

337
00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:31.360
We are a rather small country.

338
00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:32.360
At that time we had 7 billion inhabitants.

339
00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:56.280
But

340
00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:05.280
And the Gia always was very pleased. Although in the ashram, living in the ashram was beautiful on one hand and difficult on the other hand.

341
00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:21.280
I myself lived in the ashram for quite a long time in different ashrams.

342
00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:33.280
And what you have to learn when you live in an ashram is a bit to confront your own ego.

343
00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:43.280
If you have many people living in an ashram, the ego is low.

344
00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:52.280
You can't keep to your ego when you live together with other people.

345
00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:03.280
Now we don't have so many ashrams anymore, but we still meet in bigger groups and we meditate.

346
00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:16.280
And if you want to know how do we meditate, of course we all meditate the same.

347
00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:23.280
But one thing, if I talk about Austria, is they still like to meet in bigger groups and meditate.

348
00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:44.280
And we had also very difficult times and in these difficult times people were not really coming to the collective meditations.

349
00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:55.280
We had a mail server for emails instead.

350
00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:59.280
And this was a battlefield.

351
00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:08.280
It was anything else but not meditation for sure.

352
00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:23.280
And when we started meeting again, when we started enjoying ourselves, just having a music program, just singing together, just meditating together, then it really changed.

353
00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:41.280
Because when you meditate together with others, all of a sudden you find out, wow, it's my brother, it's my sister, I love them.

354
00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:45.280
All of a sudden you find out, wow, it's my brother, it's my sister, I love them.

355
00:52:54.280 --> 00:53:00.280
So yoga is always something which rather happens in collectivity.

356
00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:05.280
It's a collective yoga.

357
00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:16.280
Nastubh na patanya, kakai shaletse collective nyavaparosa.

358
00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:24.280
So the next question is how collective questions are solved, the approach to my collective decision.

359
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.280
Collective decision.

360
00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:52.280
I mean the only thing I have, and we have observed is that what we said before to go about that mechanically

361
00:53:52.280 --> 00:54:02.280
and especially to go about it with little envelopes and little papers and make it a democratic process almost

362
00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:16.280
was not what Shri Mataji did when she was around and also she did not emphasize that and somehow it became a practice. Sorry.

363
00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:32.280
Nastubhata, parstaksa sadatamukhata, yavsahajayoje, vyakorasto, yajnipapurci, konverta, nyavireshne rismekh putan, mezro samil ek

364
00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:34.280
nyatte shavabulashrimata che.

365
00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:42.280
So our experience in the early days was whenever there were collective decisions to be made, we were sitting together

366
00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:53.280
and in a joyful mood and in a vibrational mood, one idea came up which was useful and basically supported by everyone

367
00:54:53.280 --> 00:55:03.280
because everyone felt the vibrations and that was the process. And this process I would say includes also a respect for

368
00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:39.280
I would say not only senior yogis but for words of wisdom when they are coming.

369
00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:57.280
And on the other side when decisions arise which we do not agree or which do not feel so right for the moment

370
00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:12.280
and we struggle with them, we can resort to bandhan and the internal reaction.

371
00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:29.280
If I may say also in the context of the whole email communications, when decisions or discussions are done on email

372
00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:40.280
I always saw what a difference it makes when there is an email exchange and when there is an exchange between yogis when they are together.

373
00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:55.180
If I will ask the same question in the Black remembering session which concerns me the most during the

374
00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:16.280
Especially when you are with your friends and youngies who you know very well.

375
00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:23.280
I think that the most important thing is to have a strong relationship with the audience.

376
00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:27.280
Because this is not an atmospheric atmosphere, this is not a real atmosphere.

377
00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:31.280
I think that the most important thing is to have a strong relationship with the audience.

378
00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:36.280
And not only with the audience, but also with the audience.

379
00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:48.280
To have a strong relationship with the audience.

380
00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:53.280
Because everything is about the creativity of the audience,

381
00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:56.280
and the creativity of the audience.

382
00:57:56.280 --> 00:58:00.280
And I think that the audience is very important.

383
00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:26.280
But then it means being collective means you do what the leader wants to do.

384
00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:33.280
It's more subtle than that.

385
00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:37.280
Because if there is a love and respect,

386
00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:48.280
then that leader wants to have a decision process which brings people together.

387
00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:50.280
Because it is love, and it is love which is ensured.

388
00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:53.280
It's not to impose one decision.

389
00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:05.280
So it is a trial and error method.

390
00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:09.280
Every method is good if it works.

391
00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:27.280
There are many interesting stories that we have.

392
00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:30.280
One I want to tell in the ashrams in the early days.

393
00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:41.280
So when you had a problem with somebody, you would study that personality well.

394
00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:55.280
Then you would find a speech where shimadaji addresses all the weaknesses the other person has,

395
00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:57.280
and put it for the morning meditation next day.

396
01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:09.280
Of course somebody might feel offended.

397
01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:22.280
So the person would also choose a speech for the second day, where all the my weaknesses are exposed.

398
01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:24.280
And this is how we learn.

399
01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:41.280
So if we look at all the emails going around, sometimes the game is still wrong.

400
01:00:52.280 --> 01:01:02.280
And don't use quotes of shimadaji to fight. Please.

401
01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:16.280
Sometimes when I see the email exchange on the web, I want to quote Shakespeare.

402
01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.280
So I am quoting.

403
01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:42.280
A tale taught by an idiot, full of sound and fury,

404
01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:57.280
sound and fury, yes, signifying nothing.

405
01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:12.280
So let's not express the sign of resentment, hate, aggression.

406
01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:15.280
Because it does not help.

407
01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:29.280
Again, if we do it, we are fighting at the bottom of the triangle.

408
01:02:45.280 --> 01:03:09.280
Is it good to offer to Havana all that comes to your head right now?

409
01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:13.280
Or is it better to pray the least before I end?

410
01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:17.280
What are you like?

411
01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:30.280
Can you say something?

412
01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:36.280
What I noticed, sometimes people prepare pushes really well.

413
01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:45.280
And that creates its own vibrations.

414
01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:51.280
And sometimes every little thing is written down.

415
01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:58.280
Like you start with this song.

416
01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:04.280
Then for the Ganesha you sing first, namami.

417
01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:09.280
Then comes Jaya Jaya Jammali.

418
01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.280
And so on and on.

419
01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:18.280
That doesn't leave much space for the spontaneous flow.

420
01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:26.280
So if we prepare well, Shimadaji is definitely pleased.

421
01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:39.280
And if we leave a space so that still we can listen to what she tells us to do with the pusha, then it might be even better.

422
01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:54.280
And this is, of course she is always appreciating if the preparations go, she always will love that.

423
01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:00.280
But same with Havana, with everything.

424
01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:12.280
When we over-organize it, as Gregor has mentioned, if too much procedure, then somehow the vibrations might not be able to unfold as they would otherwise.

425
01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:28.280
So, let's go to the next question.

426
01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:45.280
So, there is internal dissonance when Sahaja Yogis have illnesses and bad character.

427
01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:49.280
And spreading Sahaja Yoga, how to overcome it?

428
01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:36.280
If you are a person who is personally ill and has bad character, has the right to spread Sahaja Yoga?

429
01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:51.280
What is the doctor? I would say if someone is ill, you should stay in bed and not do a program.

430
01:06:51.280 --> 01:07:00.280
I would like to ask Dr. Yamoji to tell us that he is in a bad situation and he is in a bad situation.

431
01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:32.280
Is there a situation in which you feel that you are not active in Sahaja Yoga?

432
01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:44.280
It seems it goes with the territory, but I think it is simple. What I feel works with many negative people.

433
01:07:44.280 --> 01:08:08.280
If there is a friendly conversation, really from heart to heart, where we explain that simply it's like there are times for us to be in a bad situation.

434
01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:19.280
You say to everyone that you are not well when you are off and all that.

435
01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:26.280
And you say that in a friendly way so that the other person understands there is a chance that this can be resolved.

436
01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:41.280
And if you are not active in Sahaja Yoga, then you are in a bad situation.

437
01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:52.280
And one thing is always there. If people who are not really alright spread so much Sahaja Yoga, there is a very simple method of how to change that.

438
01:08:52.280 --> 01:09:01.280
And what is the reason why you are not active in Sahaja Yoga?

439
01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:06.280
That those people who are very much in power have too much more problems.

440
01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:17.280
And what is the reason why you are not active in Sahaja Yoga?

441
01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:24.280
Any questions?

442
01:09:53.280 --> 01:10:02.280
I have the desire to live in Ashram. If it's real, I won't show it after that.

443
01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:06.280
Start one.

444
01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:36.280
I have written some wrote it with Emen

445
01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:46.280
So I present a place where there is a big Sahaj Yogi collective.

446
01:10:46.280 --> 01:11:03.280
But we have such tendency which is in fact very common. We have a lot of elder yogis.

447
01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:15.280
And we have a few yogashakti.

448
01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:32.280
And the most of yogashaktis we have in our collective are children of yogis.

449
01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:49.280
Can you give any advice how to attract youth to the collective?

450
01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:56.280
You know a human being is a human being.

451
01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:01.280
Realized soul is a realized soul.

452
01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:08.280
Divine can work through someone who is old.

453
01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:17.280
Divine can work through someone who is young.

454
01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:21.280
It is not so important.

455
01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:27.280
Maybe you don't have youth in your village.

456
01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:31.280
They will be used somewhere else.

457
01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:41.280
But if you have nice old people who have a spiritual power,

458
01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:46.280
the Divine will know how to use that.

459
01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:56.280
So enjoy your old people and don't cry after the missing youth.

460
01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:32.280
There is a question from Sahaj Yogi from the city who is now in the war.

461
01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:38.280
He is like a soldier. So he is listening over for the seminar.

462
01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:44.280
He is appreciating your coming in the conversation and discussing the problem of Ukraine.

463
01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:52.280
And asking what do you see a political solution towards what is now happening in Ukraine.

464
01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:58.280
I thought we were going to end this discussion, not to open another one.

465
01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:08.280
Where there is a will, there is a way.

466
01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:18.280
And I gave some elements of the response.

467
01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:26.280
First of all, instead of seeing the corruption in Russia,

468
01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:31.280
Ukrainians should correct the corruption in Ukraine.

469
01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:42.280
First of all, you have to understand the problems of Ukraine and its people.

470
01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:49.280
This is the basics.

471
01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:57.280
Then, if you want to restore peace in the country, you need to understand how the other side is feeling.

472
01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:02.280
Because negotiation is to understand the other side.

473
01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:08.280
I think that the people of Ukraine should not be afraid of the other side.

474
01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:14.280
Because they will be afraid of the other side's conflict.

475
01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:23.280
So first of all, don't dream about the West.

476
01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:29.280
Slav people have a community of destiny, by history and by geography.

477
01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:44.280
Don't think that the people who are going to save you are coming from Paris and London.

478
01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:56.280
And then there are a number of things that Ukrainian authorities on their side can do to reduce the gap and restore the trust.

479
01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:14.280
But then of course the Russians also need to breach their side of the gap.

480
01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:21.280
This is the second side of the triangle.

481
01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:32.280
And if the time is right, there are things Ukraine can do to restore trust.

482
01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:47.280
You don't want me to continue, right?

483
01:16:51.280 --> 01:17:04.280
Well, you know, if I would like to speak intelligently, I would like to stay one month in the country, I would like to go on the border zone.

484
01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:07.280
I would like to talk to many people, then I would talk to you.

485
01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:27.280
One thing I feel because I'm coming from Switzerland.

486
01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:32.280
We are a very small country.

487
01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:38.280
We have four official languages.

488
01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:49.280
When you get an official paper, often it is in two languages.

489
01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:53.280
Now, if you are confident, remember what I told you.

490
01:17:53.280 --> 01:18:00.280
If you are confident as Ukrainian,

491
01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:04.280
you all speak Russian.

492
01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:16.280
What is the problem if you acknowledge Russia as an official language of Ukraine?

493
01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:29.280
I know some people feel we lose our nationality, but these are people who are insecure.

494
01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:38.280
Look at your history, if you are confident as a nation.

495
01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:46.280
You can have two official languages. We have four.

496
01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:55.280
And in the past we used to fight, but not now.

497
01:18:55.280 --> 01:19:00.280
So you need to give something to reassure, you need to go in the direction of love.

498
01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:03.280
But then of course you need to do it at the right time.

499
01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:08.280
Because on the other hand, on the other side there needs also to be a movement.

500
01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:19.280
We have a strong relationship with the people of the country, but we are not in a situation where we can have a conflict.

501
01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:27.280
When I tell you that you are on the left side of the right agar, it means that you are at the place where you can open the agar.

502
01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:35.280
I have a strong relationship with the people of the country, but I have a strong relationship with the people of the country.

503
01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:42.280
But if you have faith you will be strong and you will not be afraid of losing your nationality.

504
01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:48.280
If you are really Ukrainian, who can prevent you from being Ukrainian? Nobody can.

505
01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:03.280
Only the strong can be compassionate.

506
01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:16.280
I know that you feel under aggression. I understand that.

507
01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:26.280
But take it from the top of the triangle and not from the bottom.

508
01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:37.280
Thank you.

509
01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:56.280
I would like to ask you a question about your attitude towards nationalism and patriotism.

510
01:20:56.280 --> 01:21:17.280
Have you had this kind of talk with the Russian yogis in Russia? Do you plan to have some talks in the near time?

511
01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:22.280
What would you advise Russian yogis in the situation in which you are in Russia now?

512
01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:29.280
I come to Ukraine because Ukrainian yogis have invited me.

513
01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:45.280
So maybe if the Russian yogis would invite me, I would come if I have time.

514
01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:53.280
But I am not coming when I am not invited.

515
01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:57.280
I am not coming when I am not invited.

516
01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:05.280
I would like to ask you a question about your attitude towards nationalism and patriotism.

517
01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:28.280
You see, I think we are going to stay here until the end of the day.

518
01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:45.280
But you know, the intellectual property of Shri Mataji is owned by an IPC which is owning the work of Shri Mataji on behalf of the Sangha.

519
01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:47.280
She gave it to the Sangha.

520
01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:57.280
But I am not going to ask you a question.

521
01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:02.280
I am going to ask you about intellectual property of Shri Mataji.

522
01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:13.560
And intellectual property of Shri Mataji is owned by a

523
01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:18.560
All yogis have decided to put everything on the web.

524
01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:22.560
And the policy of an IPC is the following.

525
01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:36.860
I have a problem with the

526
01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:44.860
Every yogi and yogini have a right to complete free open access to all the work.

527
01:23:44.860 --> 01:24:11.860
But for non yogis some material need to have discriminate access because if a non yogi hear something that Shri Mataji said for yogis only, it is too much instead of taking them in sahaja.

528
01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:13.860
It will make them run away.

529
01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:17.860
But the reason is that the non yogi cannot be a yogi.

530
01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:22.860
So the material needs to be taken into account.

531
01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:24.860
The same thing with Shri Mataji.

532
01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:26.860
He is the one who is going to use common sense.

533
01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:30.860
And he is going to use it to complete free open access to all the work.

534
01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:33.860
So it is the same thing with the picture of Shri Mataji.

535
01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:36.860
We need again to use common sense.

536
01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:42.860
But the reason is that he is the one who is going to use it to complete free open access to all the work.

537
01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:52.860
When we use a picture of Shri Mataji for public program, we should not create an unnecessary problem for the person who come for the first time.

538
01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:04.860
So use your judgment.

539
01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:10.860
If there is a picture with a big crown or svasthika, some people may have a problem.

540
01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:13.860
Because for them svasthika means the nazis.

541
01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:33.860
Of course we will educate them and we will say svasthika is auspicious.

542
01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:38.860
But if you want to bring people in sahaja yoga in the beginning, make it easy.

543
01:25:38.860 --> 01:25:41.860
And then they will take the crown and the svasthika.

544
01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:44.860
But not just in the beginning because they will not understand.

545
01:25:44.860 --> 01:26:10.860
You have given problems in Muslim countries and I don't speak the same thing in Rabat or Istanbul as I can in India.

546
01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:27.860
Because in India there is the notion of avatar but not in Muslim religion.

547
01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:38.860
So in short answer is be discriminate.

548
01:26:44.860 --> 01:27:09.860
So in that case you have to say that some jinnists say that there is no need to put the photo of Shri Mataji at all for public program.

549
01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:18.860
I want to put the picture of Shri Mataji because I am proud of my mother.

550
01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:27.860
I want to put the picture of Shri Mataji because I am proud of my mother.

551
01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:41.860
I gave a program in a street festival on climate change in Geneva.

552
01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:50.860
I gave a program in a street festival on climate change in Geneva.

553
01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:55.860
Climate change meeting.

554
01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:01.860
At the end they are asking to give realization.

555
01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:08.860
No picture of Shri Mataji.

556
01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:11.860
They got the realization in 5 minutes.

557
01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:20.860
So you can't give realization without the picture.

558
01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:32.860
But my desire as a yogi is to glorify Shri Mataji, not to hide her.

559
01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:43.860
But Shri Mataji is the one who gives the evidence.

560
01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:48.860
Thank you.

561
01:29:08.860 --> 01:29:15.580
Please welcome the

562
01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:20.860
medical person.

563
01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:23.860
She is a doctor.

564
01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:26.860
If I can ask medical question.

565
01:29:27.860 --> 01:29:35.860
What is the course of liver cleansing to normalize and balance right side?

566
01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:42.860
What is the treatment for liver to normalize right side?

567
01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:44.860
Liver treatment course.

568
01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:45.860
Thank you.

569
01:29:47.860 --> 01:29:49.860
Liver treatment, no question.

570
01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:53.860
Liver treatment.

571
01:29:56.860 --> 01:30:05.860
Most of us know that Shri Mataji has basically put this discrimination for left side and right side.

572
01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:07.860
Nutrition.

573
01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:34.860
Basically what it is about is that there is these two food substances of protein and carbohydrates.

574
01:30:35.860 --> 01:30:38.860
Which have their specific effects on left and right side.

575
01:30:51.860 --> 01:30:57.860
So if there is too much right side, which also means that the liver has a tendency to be overactive.

576
01:30:58.860 --> 01:31:02.860
You use non-veg food predominantly.

577
01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:10.860
If you have a lot of vegetables, you can use it for a long time.

578
01:31:11.860 --> 01:31:14.860
You can use it for a long time.

579
01:31:15.860 --> 01:31:26.860
Which means non-veg food, vegetables, cooked vegetables, less Shri Mataji for some reason emphasized not too many raw vegetables.

580
01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:29.860
I mean too many raw fruits.

581
01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:35.860
Also for the, even though it is a non-veg food, not too many fruits.

582
01:31:43.860 --> 01:31:49.860
Fruits have a very good cleansing effect, especially taken in the morning on an empty snobber.

583
01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:10.860
But the basic sustaining diet for too much right side is cooked vegetables, rice and other mild carbohydrates.

584
01:32:19.860 --> 01:32:25.860
And the opposite holds true, just to mention it shortly, for people who have a tendency to be too much left sided.

585
01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:31.860
You can eat more protein rich food and avoid the carbohydrates, avoid too much sugar.

586
01:32:45.860 --> 01:32:47.860
So this is basically the balancing effect.

587
01:32:48.860 --> 01:32:52.860
If there is a specific question of someone, you can also come to me afterwards.

588
01:32:55.860 --> 01:33:00.860
And if you have any questions, please let me know in the comments section.

589
01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:27.860
Thank you.

590
01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:27.860
Yes, I have a question with the question.

591
01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:47.860
So the question about the picture was that mother has come with her avatar.

592
01:34:48.860 --> 01:34:57.860
And many people now treat a portrait as like they associate themselves, like they take picture to picture.

593
01:34:59.860 --> 01:35:01.860
And like don't go beyond this.

594
01:35:02.860 --> 01:35:04.860
That was the question from this sister.

595
01:35:05.860 --> 01:35:07.860
It's a little bit complicated.

596
01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:21.860
There is a protocol of the picture of Shri Mataji.

597
01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:29.860
I came once in the ashram in England and I started taking down pictures of Shri Mataji from the world.

598
01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:45.860
And then a rishiogi complained to Shri Mataji, the one who is taking down your pictures.

599
01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:52.860
And then I started taking down pictures of Shri Mataji from the world.

600
01:36:08.860 --> 01:36:14.860
I was told that I have a portrait of Shri Mataji from the world.

601
01:36:14.860 --> 01:36:18.860
And I was told that I have a portrait of Shri Mataji from the world.

602
01:36:30.860 --> 01:36:33.860
I was told that I have a portrait of Shri Mataji from the world.

603
01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:37.860
And I started taking down the photos of Shri Mataji from the world.

604
01:36:37.860 --> 01:36:46.860
And then I started taking down photos of Shri Mataji from the world.

605
01:36:47.860 --> 01:36:50.860
And the photographs were taken from the world.

606
01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:53.860
It was a very complicated process.

607
01:36:54.860 --> 01:36:58.860
And when I took down the photos, I was told that I have a portrait of Shri Mataji from the world.

608
01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:24.860
Okay, some people are not happy what I said about official language.

609
01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:37.860
This is giving me much to much importance.

610
01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:49.860
Because feel completely free to disagree with me. I don't represent anything or anybody in Ukraine.

611
01:37:54.860 --> 01:38:05.860
We had civil wars in our country and we had also external invasions.

612
01:38:06.860 --> 01:38:10.860
And so we had to handle those situations.

613
01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:17.860
And we had to deal with the situation in the best possible manner.

614
01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:20.860
So we had to deal with the situation in the best possible manner.

615
01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:27.860
So you will handle your situation in the best possible manner and you will decide.

616
01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:33.860
I have nothing to say. If you want only one official language, it's fine with me.

617
01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:43.860
I'm just saying that if at some point you come to the point where you want to negotiate, to restore trust, think about the options that you have. That's all.

618
01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:46.860
Then, you know, forget it. Forget what I said.

619
01:39:16.860 --> 01:39:29.860
Because this is not the proper place for the discussion. I am no longer the United Nations and you are not the government. You are not the Ministry of Education.

620
01:39:47.860 --> 01:39:57.860
Can I just say what I observe now?

621
01:39:58.860 --> 01:40:10.860
We are just leaving the level of the top of the triangle.

622
01:40:10.860 --> 01:40:19.860
As Gregor has mentioned, we did not come here to have a political discussion.

623
01:40:20.860 --> 01:40:27.860
Because on that level we cannot solve the things here.

624
01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:39.860
But we have come here to create some waves that come from the collective meditative mood.

625
01:40:40.860 --> 01:40:55.860
And that these waves attract the attention and the love of our mother.

626
01:40:56.860 --> 01:41:09.860
And at the end of this wonderful event, let us keep, please, the attention on that high level and not stepping down a few steps.

627
01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:16.860
Let us keep our hands on that high level and not stepping down a few steps.

628
01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:21.860
Let us please use those powers that make us strong and not those powers that make us weak.

629
01:41:22.860 --> 01:41:30.860
Let us keep the attention on that high level and not stepping down a few steps.

630
01:41:30.860 --> 01:41:41.860
So shall we end on that level?

631
01:41:42.860 --> 01:41:47.860
Thank you very much.

632
01:42:00.860 --> 01:42:25.860
So, Yogini, I ask you if you could share some of your brightest moments of memories with Shomadhi.

633
01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:50.860
It is not a very bright memory, but it fits a little bit to the question which was asked about the liver and the right side.

634
01:42:50.860 --> 01:43:17.860
I was very fond of drinking coffee.

635
01:43:17.860 --> 01:43:42.860
And I used to drink coffee and we were in with Shri Mataji and somehow the coffee came, I like to drink it and someone said, yeah, but not too much of coffee in a bit.

636
01:43:42.860 --> 01:43:59.860
And so I felt happy and I said, okay, I can have one coffee and I have my coffee. And then someone said, yeah, but not too much.

637
01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:09.860
And so she said, you can have lots of coffee, lots of coffee.

638
01:44:09.860 --> 01:44:15.860
So it is just a short and sweet, popped in my mind.

639
01:44:24.860 --> 01:44:30.860
There is one situation in which happened in Prague.

640
01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:44.860
And Shomadhi was supposed to go to Warsaw on the next day and the flight would have gone via Vienna.

641
01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:58.860
And I was supposed to take care of the luggage to be checked in and the tickets and everything.

642
01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:12.860
And as I feel like I want to be a responsible personality, I really took it very serious.

643
01:45:13.860 --> 01:45:21.860
So I checked the tickets, timing, everything, twice.

644
01:45:22.860 --> 01:45:30.860
And Shomadhi's flight was at 10.25 on the next morning.

645
01:45:31.860 --> 01:45:39.860
So then a yogini came and she wanted to, she asked me at what time does Shomadhi have to get up and leave knowing I checked it twice.

646
01:45:40.860 --> 01:45:50.860
I told her the proper time when Shomadhi should better get up.

647
01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:57.860
And she said, I will leave tomorrow. And I told her that I will leave tomorrow.

648
01:45:58.860 --> 01:46:01.860
So we all went to sleep, we got up in the morning, it was 8.30.

649
01:46:02.860 --> 01:46:06.860
And then we went to the bar and we went to the bar and we went to the bar.

650
01:46:07.860 --> 01:46:08.860
I had even time to take a shower.

651
01:46:09.860 --> 01:46:14.860
And then we went to the bar and I was able to bring up the food.

652
01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:19.860
It was about 8.35, 8.45, I was able to go to the bar.

653
01:46:19.860 --> 01:46:23.860
And then somebody came to me and said, should we not be at the airport right now?

654
01:46:28.860 --> 01:46:30.860
And I said, no, no, our flight is at 10.25.

655
01:46:34.860 --> 01:46:36.860
Which turned out to be a slight mistake.

656
01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:42.860
The flight was at 9.25.

657
01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:47.860
I checked it twice.

658
01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:51.860
You can imagine how I felt at that moment.

659
01:46:55.860 --> 01:46:58.860
I wanted to be in the earth warm disappearing in the air.

660
01:47:05.860 --> 01:47:06.860
But I couldn't.

661
01:47:09.860 --> 01:47:16.860
So I had to wake up the yogini who was with Shomadhi and said, we have to fly this in about half an hour.

662
01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:23.860
And I said, I have to fly this in about half an hour.

663
01:47:28.860 --> 01:47:29.860
You can imagine her reaction also.

664
01:47:30.860 --> 01:47:31.860
Yes, I was in the air.

665
01:47:32.860 --> 01:47:33.860
And I felt super guilty.

666
01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:35.860
Yes, I was.

667
01:47:36.860 --> 01:47:37.860
I was in the air and I was able to leave.

668
01:47:38.860 --> 01:47:40.860
So we went to the airport with blue light and...

669
01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:45.860
So we were able to report that we were in the airport.

670
01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:51.860
And we checked in the luggage and five minutes before the departure of the flight everything was checked in.

671
01:48:02.860 --> 01:48:04.860
But the cargo technology of course did not come yet.

672
01:48:08.860 --> 01:48:13.860
And the announcement that they asked all the time for a passenger near my history of Astava did not help.

673
01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:19.860
After the dive-in I was back at my children's room.

674
01:48:21.860 --> 01:48:26.860
I knew that I could press the bargain on its lap and still check in with my parents.

675
01:48:32.860 --> 01:48:41.620
And when the plane got

676
01:48:41.860 --> 01:48:44.860
and rite passed, I think please return it to me.

677
01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:50.460
the flowers and Cimatache started to collect all the flowers.

678
01:48:50.460 --> 01:49:06.460
In the background we had the announcements calling for us.

679
01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:19.460
The sky was bright sunshine.

680
01:49:19.460 --> 01:49:26.460
But inside of me I didn't feel like sunshine.

681
01:49:26.460 --> 01:49:34.460
So ultimately after a very very long time in Cimatache

682
01:49:34.460 --> 01:49:39.460
and I collected all the flowers, we slowly proceeded to the custom control.

683
01:49:39.460 --> 01:50:00.460
And now this lady at the custom control who was a typical old fashioned army soldier person.

684
01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:13.460
I started shouting at Cimatache because she was late.

685
01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:16.460
And it was my fault.

686
01:50:16.460 --> 01:50:21.460
Can you imagine how I felt at that moment?

687
01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:30.460
I felt so super bad and then we went inside.

688
01:50:30.460 --> 01:50:38.460
And Cimatache was just worried about me because I felt so bad.

689
01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:46.460
All the things that happened to her but she was just worried about me.

690
01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:54.460
And that love, that unconditional love just made me burst into tears.

691
01:51:04.460 --> 01:51:08.460
I never had experienced such a love before in my life.

692
01:51:08.460 --> 01:51:29.460
It was a small plane as Austrian Airlines is not such a successful airline.

693
01:51:29.460 --> 01:51:35.220
I was in the middle of the night and I saw three of them sitting on the floor.

694
01:51:35.220 --> 01:51:38.220
So, Shmadezhin was sitting in a row before me.

695
01:51:38.220 --> 01:51:43.220
She said, I'm going to leave.

696
01:51:43.220 --> 01:51:49.220
All of a sudden she turned around with a very cheeky face and she said,

697
01:51:49.220 --> 01:51:52.220
you know, this plane is not going to leave.

698
01:51:52.980 --> 01:52:05.980
And I still am busy with myself.

699
01:52:10.980 --> 01:52:14.980
She turned around again and said, this plane is not going to leave.

700
01:52:22.980 --> 01:52:24.980
Five minutes later, the plane didn't leave.

701
01:52:24.980 --> 01:52:28.980
Five minutes later, the captain said, ladies and gentlemen, due to a technical problem,

702
01:52:28.980 --> 01:52:31.980
we asked you to onboard the plane.

703
01:52:31.980 --> 01:52:34.980
And she said, I'm going to leave the plane,

704
01:52:34.980 --> 01:52:37.980
because ladies and gentlemen, I have a problem with the problem.

705
01:52:37.980 --> 01:52:40.980
But I'm going to leave the plane.

706
01:52:41.980 --> 01:52:43.980
So we had to go back.

707
01:52:43.980 --> 01:52:45.980
That's what I wanted to say.

708
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:48.980
And while going back, Shmadezhin said, I told you.

709
01:52:48.980 --> 01:52:50.980
I'm going to leave.

710
01:52:52.980 --> 01:52:56.980
And then she said, now you shout at this lady, because we cannot go to Vienna.

711
01:52:56.980 --> 01:53:00.980
I'm going to leave the plane, because ladies and gentlemen, I have a problem with the plane.

712
01:53:08.980 --> 01:53:10.980
Which I clearly did.

713
01:53:10.980 --> 01:53:12.980
Which I clearly did.

714
01:53:13.740 --> 01:53:20.740
And when we came out, all the Yobies were there cheering Shmadezhin's back.

715
01:53:30.740 --> 01:53:33.740
Because they told us the next plane will be late after noon.

716
01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:41.500
But the sky before it was, there was no cloud, all of a sudden it was raining outside.

717
01:53:51.500 --> 01:53:54.500
And this was only 15 minutes ago.

718
01:53:58.500 --> 01:54:02.500
And then she said, see, your tears have become the rain.

719
01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:07.500
And you will become the sun, and you will become the peace.

720
01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:14.500
And now you will be the sun, and you will be the sun.

721
01:54:33.740 --> 01:54:36.500
Thank you.

722
01:55:03.740 --> 01:55:05.740
Thank you.
