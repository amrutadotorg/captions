WEBVTT

04:39.400 --> 04:41.520
They are transformed.

04:41.800 --> 04:45.440
Exeter has a speciality I don't know why with this kind

04:45.880 --> 04:49.280
and I'm really amazed that I've been here three times

04:49.920 --> 04:54.240
and people have not taken up life seriously.

04:54.960 --> 04:58.240
They are not taken up

04:58.440 --> 05:02.520
the purpose for which they are born.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.360
It's a sad thing I feel,

05:06.360 --> 05:08.760
but again I wanted to try

05:09.000 --> 05:13.680
that maybe you people will be able to realize

05:13.880 --> 05:17.880
how important it is to get your self-realization.

05:19.960 --> 05:23.880
Already they must have told you about your Kundalini,

05:25.120 --> 05:28.560
the power that works out

05:28.800 --> 05:32.120
this miracle of your second birth

05:32.360 --> 05:34.200
It's already being done by God.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.320
He's put everything down there it's all there.

05:37.520 --> 05:39.520
You are just ready for it.

05:39.720 --> 05:42.040
But you must have the desire.

05:42.240 --> 05:44.960
You must have an ardent desire.

05:45.160 --> 05:49.400
There cannot be any realization for a person

05:49.600 --> 05:52.400
or any development for a person

05:53.400 --> 05:57.600
if the person doesn't desire it.

05:57.840 --> 06:00.560
Your desire is the most important thing.

06:00.760 --> 06:05.280
And you will be amazed that even the Kundalini about which we are talking

06:05.480 --> 06:07.720
is nothing but your primal desire

06:07.920 --> 06:10.040
the power of your primal desire

06:10.280 --> 06:14.040
because all other desires are transitory

06:14.560 --> 06:16.760
- are absolutely temporary -

06:17.000 --> 06:18.840
and they fizzle out.

06:19.040 --> 06:22.160
You want to have a house? Alright you can have a house,

06:22.440 --> 06:25.360
then you want to have something else and then something else.

06:25.560 --> 06:28.800
Economic wants are never sessiable,

06:29.080 --> 06:31.080
So you go on asking for this and that,

06:31.280 --> 06:34.800
then you go to politics for power,

06:35.160 --> 06:38.600
you try to have some emotional experiences,

06:38.800 --> 06:40.360
all these are transitory

06:40.560 --> 06:42.680
and they all vanish into thin air

06:42.880 --> 06:47.360
while the joy of the Spirit is the permanent

06:47.600 --> 06:50.760
but people who are not desiring it

06:50.960 --> 06:52.800
are asking for frivolous things

06:53.040 --> 06:56.840
and things that are of no value at all I tell you

06:57.080 --> 06:59.640
it is of no value to have all these things

06:59.840 --> 07:02.000
because you are so affluent already

07:02.200 --> 07:05.120
still there is no joy there's no happiness,

07:05.320 --> 07:08.120
there is no peace in the family there's no bliss.

07:08.320 --> 07:12.240
So we have to achieve that which is permanent,

07:12.520 --> 07:13.920
which is eternal,

07:14.120 --> 07:15.880
which is promised to us.

07:16.080 --> 07:19.240
You have been very carefully made into this being

07:19.440 --> 07:23.840
The human being is the epitome of the creation

07:24.040 --> 07:26.120
but how far do we value ourselves,

07:26.320 --> 07:29.200
our human existence?

07:29.560 --> 07:32.800
Do we realize that thousands of years

07:33.000 --> 07:35.720
the nature has worked to make us human beings

07:35.920 --> 07:40.120
and that at this time when you have to just become the spirit

07:40.320 --> 07:42.680
we are hesitating

07:43.320 --> 07:46.920
we still are dominated by desires

07:47.120 --> 07:50.000
which are not the primary desires.

07:50.560 --> 07:53.920
Normally when the Kundalini awakens

07:54.960 --> 07:57.200
a person definitely gets transformed

07:57.400 --> 07:59.840
and he gets the power to get over

08:00.040 --> 08:02.680
all the nonsensical ideas about life

08:02.880 --> 08:05.040
all this misidentifications drop out

08:05.240 --> 08:07.280
I have known so many cases

08:07.480 --> 08:11.320
we had a boy who came from some

08:13.240 --> 08:15.320
pub I think and he was shouting at me

08:15.520 --> 08:19.600
but screaming at me and he was very very funny

08:19.800 --> 08:21.440
but he got his realization

08:21.640 --> 08:23.040
lucky he got his realization

08:23.240 --> 08:26.840
from next day he gave up everything

08:27.160 --> 08:30.640
there was no alcoholism the problem which doctors cannot solve

08:30.840 --> 08:32.640
nobody can treat him.

08:32.840 --> 08:34.920
There are so many who were suffering

08:35.120 --> 08:38.000
from diseases which were absolutely incurable

08:38.200 --> 08:39.320
just got all right.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.760
That is physical side,

08:40.960 --> 08:45.080
so many emotional problems like people who were mad lunatic got cured

08:45.720 --> 08:48.000
but the spiritual problem is the main problem

08:48.200 --> 08:50.400
where people go to fake gurus and fake people

08:50.600 --> 08:53.200
pay them lots of money run like mad

08:53.400 --> 08:56.080
and then they come back and find that they

08:56.280 --> 08:58.400
that was a fake guru and they give up.

08:58.600 --> 09:01.040
But why? Why do like the fake guru so much

09:01.240 --> 09:02.360
and not Sahaja Yoga?

09:02.960 --> 09:05.480
We should find out why. Why is it that the fake gurus

09:05.680 --> 09:07.720
in this Exeter we had a fake guru

09:07.960 --> 09:10.280
who had thousands of disciples

09:10.480 --> 09:12.920
and why for Sahaja yoga we can't get people?

09:13.120 --> 09:15.560
The reason is say plain and simple.

09:15.760 --> 09:18.200
I was told that this gentleman

09:18.400 --> 09:20.680
who was supposed to be the Guru

09:20.920 --> 09:21.960
used to drink,

09:22.160 --> 09:23.160
used to have women,

09:23.360 --> 09:24.480
do all kinds of things

09:24.680 --> 09:26.600
and every disciple was allowed to have

09:26.800 --> 09:29.320
any kind of unrighteous life that they wanted.

09:29.520 --> 09:32.120
Because no power was given to the disciples.

09:32.360 --> 09:35.560
Only they had one power is to pay to this horrible man.

09:35.760 --> 09:37.560
That's all the power they had

09:37.760 --> 09:40.280
and they thought that we can purchase this guru,

09:40.480 --> 09:44.360
we can buy this man and by buying this man we are something.

09:44.600 --> 09:47.520
Oh, there's another one who talks that you will become great,

09:47.720 --> 09:49.720
you have to be very great, Christ was nothing,

09:49.920 --> 09:52.218
you are going to become very great.

09:52.800 --> 09:56.320
All such talks sometimes really pamper our ego

09:56.520 --> 09:58.840
and we get driven to that.

09:59.040 --> 10:01.880
One should know that one has to be real

10:02.080 --> 10:03.080
and honest.

10:03.280 --> 10:05.200
If you are not honest to yourself,

10:05.400 --> 10:07.320
how can anybody else make it?

10:07.520 --> 10:09.800
You have to be honest yourself first of all,

10:10.000 --> 10:12.120
that you must know that you want the reality.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.000
And if you want the reality was no you cannot pay for it.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.240
You cannot pay for it.

10:16.440 --> 10:18.840
You have to become - you have to become that.

10:19.040 --> 10:21.680
That becoming is not so difficult.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.800
I tell you it is not at all difficult

10:24.000 --> 10:26.440
because so many people who have got realization in England

10:26.640 --> 10:29.360
they are are in thousands and they are doing very well

10:29.560 --> 10:32.240
they are beautiful people, they are all realized Souls

10:32.440 --> 10:34.280
and they know how to handle the Kundalini.

10:34.480 --> 10:35.760
They also cure people.

10:35.960 --> 10:38.360
Not only that but their lives are changed that patterns are changed

10:38.680 --> 10:41.400
they are very happy joyous people.

10:42.280 --> 10:43.240
This has to happen

10:43.440 --> 10:46.040
the time has come of your resurrection.

10:46.240 --> 10:48.320
The whole of humanity has to rise to it.

10:48.520 --> 10:52.760
This is the only solution that you can think of for all the turmoils,

10:52.960 --> 10:55.320
all the destruction that is facing us today.

10:55.520 --> 10:59.320
But do we realize that we are playing a part in their destruction,

10:59.520 --> 11:02.120
if you do not take to this lift.

11:02.320 --> 11:06.640
This lift is very important in our lives and we have to do it.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.960
I do not know why but

11:09.160 --> 11:10.520
it is really surprising

11:10.720 --> 11:14.600
why people do not want to become themselves.

11:14.880 --> 11:16.720
To be the self is the master.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.720
You are the master of yourself.

11:18.920 --> 11:20.680
You have to be the master of yourself

11:20.880 --> 11:25.360
and not of some sort of silly ideas and stupid things.

11:25.560 --> 11:30.040
If you become the master naturally nothing can dominate you.

11:30.240 --> 11:31.480
You become the free bird,

11:31.680 --> 11:34.000
you become absolutely on top of everything

11:34.200 --> 11:38.000
and you can see everything as just a drama and a witness.

11:38.200 --> 11:39.480
All this is within you.

11:39.680 --> 11:43.760
All these powers are within you because the Spirit is within.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.680
The Kundalini is within.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.520
You have to adjust.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.280
First of all get your realization,

11:50.480 --> 11:53.200
enlightenment and maintain it for a while

11:53.400 --> 11:55.000
and you don't need much effort

11:55.200 --> 11:57.960
because after realization you are really empowered.

11:58.160 --> 11:59.840
You get over your frivolities.

12:00.040 --> 12:01.760
You get over your stupidities

12:01.960 --> 12:06.280
and you get over all these nagging habits that put you down

12:06.480 --> 12:08.600
your self-respect and everything.

12:09.360 --> 12:12.960
Now it is easy for people to go

12:13.160 --> 12:15.960
to any you know whatsoever because you don't have to do anything.

12:16.160 --> 12:19.400
You just have to go pay some money and you become the disciple.

12:19.600 --> 12:22.200
The guru who doesn't do anything he doesn't even travel.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.360
He doesn't do anything. He sits nicely.

12:24.560 --> 12:28.200
You go and give you money and he enjoys your money and he's a parasite.

12:28.840 --> 12:32.160
But here you are the guru, you have to become the guru.

12:32.360 --> 12:35.360
Here you have to become the self, you have to be the guru,

12:35.560 --> 12:38.040
which is the principle already in you

12:38.240 --> 12:39.600
it is to be enlightened.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.840
You cannot depend on anyone.

12:42.040 --> 12:43.480
You have to depend on yourself

12:43.680 --> 12:47.520
and you are already entitle and empower to be that.

12:47.720 --> 12:50.840
Sahaja. Sahaja means: born with you.

12:51.040 --> 12:53.040
Saha is with - born with you.

12:53.240 --> 12:57.120
This power to be united with the divine is with you.

12:57.320 --> 12:58.200
It is within you.

12:58.400 --> 13:01.040
And the time has come. This is the Blossom time.

13:01.240 --> 13:03.000
And this time you have to get it.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.000
If you lack behind you have to face the problems.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.160
You have to face the problems lateron.

13:08.360 --> 13:10.480
So those who call themselves as seekers,

13:10.680 --> 13:14.575
those who say that we are seeking God, we are seeking the truth, must know

13:14.775 --> 13:18.858
that to see the truth is to see the truth within themselves and not without.

13:19.058 --> 13:21.440
If somebody says that, "You are going to fly in the air.

13:21.640 --> 13:23.880
You have to see the stars and  the moons."

13:24.240 --> 13:27.000
That's not way. It is within yourself.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.120
You have to see what you are

13:29.320 --> 13:33.920
and when you start feeling your spirit you start feeling others also.

13:34.240 --> 13:37.040
Because your spirit is the collective being.

13:37.240 --> 13:40.600
You have to become that. Again I say: "You have to become that spirit."

13:40.800 --> 13:43.320
So far your spirit is just watching you.

13:43.520 --> 13:45.520
It doesn't come into the play.

13:45.720 --> 13:47.600
It doesn't come into the play.

13:47.800 --> 13:51.440
It is still there in a state we can call as a witness.

13:51.640 --> 13:53.760
He is witnessing all that you are doing.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
But once the Kundalini rises from its base,

13:57.200 --> 13:59.360
there as you see in the triangular bone,

13:59.560 --> 14:01.800
it comes up, breaks through

14:02.080 --> 14:07.920
and you start felling the existence of spirit

14:08.360 --> 14:10.120
on your nervous system.

14:10.320 --> 14:12.840
You can feel it in your hands.

14:13.040 --> 14:16.840
It is so simple that even children can feel it.

14:17.360 --> 14:21.000
Say for example, in this room you have to put a light.

14:21.240 --> 14:23.840
Just you have to press one button and you get the light.

14:24.040 --> 14:25.360
But it's not so simple.

14:25.560 --> 14:26.880
To look at it look simple,

14:27.080 --> 14:28.600
it looks absolutely life.

14:28.800 --> 14:33.200
If you tell a villager, the one who has never seen how electricity works,

14:33.400 --> 14:36.040
he won't believe it. He won't believe that this is possible.

14:36.240 --> 14:39.320
It is so naive for his mind also that how can it be?

14:39.520 --> 14:41.400
Just you press the button and you get the light.

14:41.640 --> 14:43.720
But you do with the light and how

14:43.920 --> 14:46.720
because there is a mechanism here.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.600
There is an organization behind it.

14:48.800 --> 14:52.000
Then it's a history behind and there is an evolution behind it.

14:52.200 --> 14:56.120
Now we are standing at the last part of our evolution.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.960
The human awareness that it is today

14:59.360 --> 15:01.280
is still not complete.

15:01.480 --> 15:04.160
If it was we would not have been so much confused.

15:04.360 --> 15:07.960
We are confused because our awareness has not reached that stage

15:08.160 --> 15:09.560
where we become the spirit.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.480
Christ has said you are to be born again.

15:11.680 --> 15:13.680
Now there are people I have heard the other day the

15:13.880 --> 15:17.840
one gentleman came and started talking just like a tape recorder

15:18.040 --> 15:21.440
that Christ was just a Kundalini yogi and all that thing.

15:21.640 --> 15:24.760
Who are they to judge Christ? What do they know about him?

15:24.960 --> 15:26.814
What is their power to judge him.

15:27.014 --> 15:30.640
You see, any big Tom and Harry stands up and start talking about anyone.

15:30.880 --> 15:33.360
First of all let us know: "What is your power?"

15:33.560 --> 15:35.560
Let's see what do you know about it.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.120
Have do you found yourself?

15:37.320 --> 15:38.800
Please be honest about it.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.560
Please be honest. That's all is needed.

15:41.760 --> 15:43.680
Because the whole nature,

15:44.160 --> 15:46.360
the whole creation,

15:46.600 --> 15:49.560
all the pervading power of God's love

15:49.840 --> 15:51.520
is trying to do this for you.

15:51.720 --> 15:55.560
Everyone is trying to. I sometimes feel  people are pampered

15:55.760 --> 15:58.730
because the way I see these days miracles happening

15:58.930 --> 16:00.800
to thousands of people getting realization.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.520
I am myself amazed

16:02.800 --> 16:06.280
how the Divine itself

16:06.480 --> 16:08.960
has taken upon itself

16:09.160 --> 16:11.160
to give this realization to you,

16:11.360 --> 16:13.320
to give this experience to you,

16:13.520 --> 16:15.080
to do this for you.

16:15.280 --> 16:17.280
It is something so remarkable.

16:17.480 --> 16:21.600
The whole compassion is working out this great work,

16:21.800 --> 16:25.080
this great drama of giving realizations to you.

16:25.280 --> 16:27.960
Of course if you are not a seeker you will take time.

16:28.160 --> 16:31.640
I mean you can teach people to see. You have to be hungry.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.920
If you are not seeking it's not easy.

16:34.120 --> 16:35.520
I know it is very difficult.

16:35.720 --> 16:39.880
And if you are not seeking you will take I think some time to do it.

16:40.080 --> 16:42.280
Some people who are not seeking

16:42.480 --> 16:44.960
also when they see so many coming to Sahaja Yoga

16:45.160 --> 16:47.920
getting cured, having a better life,

16:48.120 --> 16:51.960
enjoying themselves becoming such good people also follow them

16:52.200 --> 16:55.440
but those who are seekers do not wait for any such things.

16:55.640 --> 16:58.960
They just jump into it, get it and become that.

16:59.360 --> 17:01.600
Are we going to waste our human life?

17:01.800 --> 17:04.400
Are we not going to be what we are meant for?

17:04.600 --> 17:08.240
For example see this instrument is made with such difficulties

17:08.440 --> 17:11.320
and with such care

17:11.520 --> 17:14.760
but if you do not put this to the mains,

17:14.960 --> 17:16.280
what's the use?

17:16.520 --> 17:18.520
What's the use of this instrument?

17:18.720 --> 17:20.520
Is it's a waste? It's just a waste.

17:20.720 --> 17:23.680
And that's what one should know that you should put it to the mains

17:23.880 --> 17:27.640
and put into the mains itself means getting realization.

17:27.840 --> 17:30.720
Yoga means union with the Divine.

17:30.920 --> 17:33.400
The divine power that is all-pervading.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.720
This divine power is there,

17:35.920 --> 17:37.240
we can see its effects.

17:37.440 --> 17:40.640
All the living work is done by that power.

17:40.840 --> 17:43.800
A flower becomes a fruit through that power,

17:44.280 --> 17:46.640
we exist because of that power.

17:46.840 --> 17:49.800
If you see these eyes how beautifully God made,

17:50.000 --> 17:51.640
how beautifully he has made us.

17:51.840 --> 17:54.840
All that is done by this God's loving power

17:55.040 --> 17:57.440
which is all-pervading. It is very subtle.

17:57.640 --> 17:58.680
You cannot feel it

17:58.880 --> 18:02.480
because with this awareness we are not yet that subtle.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.680
Only after realization you can feel that power

18:05.880 --> 18:09.480
and you start feeling it as the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

18:09.680 --> 18:11.440
That should happen to all of you.

18:11.640 --> 18:17.280
Even if it happens you must keep the connection all right.

18:17.480 --> 18:19.120
If you are loosely connected,

18:19.320 --> 18:21.800
if you do not put in effort to keep the connection on

18:22.000 --> 18:23.160
sometimes it drops out.

18:23.360 --> 18:27.000
And that's what I find people become extremely critical

18:27.200 --> 18:32.760
and extremely high-handed.

18:32.960 --> 18:36.120
They think that why should I do thi,s why should I do this?

18:36.360 --> 18:38.160
Because that is how you keep the connection.

18:38.600 --> 18:42.680
You will be amazed that in India thousands of people have got realization in the village

18:42.880 --> 18:47.840
Thousands and in this Exeter how many people are fine today? Three!

18:48.280 --> 18:50.840
You are lagging behind. I am telling you're lagging behind.

18:51.040 --> 18:54.760
Once I go to America, I know,  Americans will take to it very fast

18:54.960 --> 18:59.000
because they are fed up of guru shopping, they are absolutely tired of it.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.760
They don't want to talk about it

19:00.960 --> 19:02.720
and they want to have self-realization.

19:02.920 --> 19:05.360
But here what are we doing?

19:05.720 --> 19:10.160
You can imagine that thousands of people have already got realization.

19:10.360 --> 19:13.840
They are transformed, while people otherwise

19:14.040 --> 19:18.120
who are too much critical, think too much about it, do not get it.

19:18.320 --> 19:22.320
But we must come to logical conclusions.

19:22.520 --> 19:25.960
Without coming to logical conclusion you should not jump on to anything blindly.

19:26.160 --> 19:27.600
That's absolutely wrong.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.160
Use your brains I say.

19:29.360 --> 19:33.200
Like today the gentleman at the BBC asked me that:

19:33.440 --> 19:36.760
"How is it many people are going to these fake gurus

19:36.960 --> 19:38.560
and paying them such a lot of money?"

19:38.760 --> 19:41.320
I said they should use their brains! What has happened to their brains?

19:41.520 --> 19:43.200
Why don't they use their brains?

19:43.400 --> 19:45.720
First of all you cannot pay for God's love.

19:45.920 --> 19:48.280
That's simple, very simple as that.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.880
You cannot pay for His love.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.560
You have never paid.

19:52.760 --> 19:54.760
You never paid for becoming human beings.

19:54.960 --> 19:58.000
You never paid for getting a flower into a fruit.

19:58.200 --> 20:00.800
You cannot pay for all these things.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.120
Secondly you cannot put in any effort for a spontaneous thing.

20:05.720 --> 20:08.200
Whatever is living happens spontaneously,

20:08.400 --> 20:10.680
this is a living process of the Living God.

20:10.880 --> 20:12.400
So, come to right conclusion,

20:12.600 --> 20:17.000
that if anything has to happen to us it has to happen within,

20:17.240 --> 20:20.600
it has to happen in a way where we do not put in any effort,

20:20.800 --> 20:22.640
where we do not pay.

20:22.840 --> 20:25.160
Minimum of minimum this much we should understand

20:25.360 --> 20:27.160
that this cannot be.

20:27.360 --> 20:30.480
Then the person who talks of God of divine love and things,

20:30.680 --> 20:32.800
if he is interested in your purse,

20:33.000 --> 20:34.640
if he's interested in your women,

20:34.840 --> 20:36.640
who leads an unrighteous life

20:36.840 --> 20:38.760
he has no business to be a guru,

20:38.960 --> 20:41.511
he has no business to be there.

20:41.711 --> 20:44.200
Then we have to come to another conclusion -

20:44.400 --> 20:46.880
very positively: We are seekers.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.360
We are seekers of truth.

20:48.560 --> 20:49.760
We are seeking God.

20:49.960 --> 20:51.296
We are seeking the divine

20:51.496 --> 20:54.551
and unless until we find it we are not going to rest.

20:54.751 --> 20:56.679
We have to find it at any cost.

20:56.879 --> 20:58.800
You might have done lots of mistakes, I know.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.280
In seeking people have done lots of mistake. They have gone to wrong places,

21:02.480 --> 21:05.440
they have been hit, people had epilepsy, they had all kinds of things.

21:05.640 --> 21:07.440
I know that. Doesn't matter!

21:07.640 --> 21:11.360
All these things can be corrected and improved.

21:11.560 --> 21:13.720
Because as I told you:

21:13.920 --> 21:16.680
The divine power itself, the divinity itself,

21:17.000 --> 21:19.920
God himself wants to save his creation

21:20.120 --> 21:23.000
because you are the epitome of his creation.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.480
He wants to give you this,

21:24.680 --> 21:27.440
but it is not because you live in a particular place

21:27.640 --> 21:29.840
and if you are arrogant or egoistical

21:30.040 --> 21:32.920
or if you are afraid that he is going to bother about you.

21:33.120 --> 21:36.520
For him the whole race of human beings is just the same.

21:36.720 --> 21:39.560
If you are a human being you can get your realization.

21:39.800 --> 21:42.720
That's all is wanted that you have to be a human being.

21:42.920 --> 21:47.080
And the second is the people who are really seeking get it very fast.

21:47.520 --> 21:50.520
Some people get it very fast and also lose it very fast,

21:50.720 --> 21:52.760
because they do not understand the value of that.

21:52.960 --> 21:55.480
The idea that we have to suffer for spirituality

21:55.680 --> 22:00.920
is absolutely out of take and absolutely out of any context.

22:01.120 --> 22:03.640
Because if you know Christ has suffered for us,

22:03.840 --> 22:05.400
he has suffered for us,

22:05.600 --> 22:08.040
and people said that once he has suffered for us

22:08.240 --> 22:10.680
he sucks in our sins,

22:10.880 --> 22:12.560
he sucks in our Karmas,

22:12.760 --> 22:15.560
then why are you suffering? Why do you want to suffer?

22:15.760 --> 22:17.440
Has he not suffered sufficiently?

22:17.640 --> 22:20.640
He is to be awakened within you. That's what it is.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.040
Once he's awakened within you he sucks in.

22:23.240 --> 22:26.720
As you can see clearly there at the point here,

22:26.920 --> 22:29.880
where it is between the optic chiasma

22:30.080 --> 22:33.560
near the pituitary and the pineal body is placed this subtle Center

22:33.760 --> 22:35.160
which when awakened

22:35.360 --> 22:38.600
sucks in the ego and superego under the sides.

22:39.840 --> 22:42.560
So everything will be forgiven.

22:43.046 --> 22:46.400
There's nothing to worry about the past, nothing to feel guilty.

22:46.600 --> 22:49.400
Everything can be worked out so easily.

22:49.600 --> 22:52.600
If the Kundalini is allowed to rise it can suck in.

22:52.800 --> 22:56.320
Once the center is awakened there's no problem at all

22:56.560 --> 22:58.880
and you get your realization quite all right.

22:59.080 --> 23:01.320
Today I was surprised that at BBC this thing

23:01.520 --> 23:04.280
the gentlemen both of them the producer

23:04.680 --> 23:06.960
and the director both of them got realization.

23:07.160 --> 23:09.720
It's such a good thing to see

23:09.920 --> 23:12.960
that those people who are not so much concerned with spirit

23:13.160 --> 23:16.800
and not concerned with spiritual ascent got the realization.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.040
I was really enamored, I was so very happy about it.

23:20.240 --> 23:24.080
I mean there are people and people who get realised no doubt

23:24.280 --> 23:28.320
like in India, I would say that people understand

23:29.040 --> 23:31.320
who is a real guru and who is not.

23:31.520 --> 23:33.520
Because they are not lying about it.

23:33.720 --> 23:35.908
This is the knowledge about the roots.

23:36.108 --> 23:38.520
While you know about the shoot, you don't know what the roots,

23:38.720 --> 23:40.094
while they know about the roots.

23:40.294 --> 23:41.571
They know what it is,

23:41.771 --> 23:44.840
how to find it, what happens and how you achieve it.

23:45.040 --> 23:46.720
Everyone knows about Kundalini.

23:46.920 --> 23:49.080
You won't find any Indian who doesn't know about Kundalini.

23:49.280 --> 23:52.160
Maybe they are westernized. Westernized I can't say.

23:52.360 --> 23:54.760
But everyone knows it is the Kundalini awakening

23:54.960 --> 23:56.880
by which you get your realization.

23:57.080 --> 24:00.800
So now I have to request again to all of you living in Exeter.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.040
I have a feeling that Exeter has lots of seekers

24:04.240 --> 24:05.960
but they're somehow lost somewhere.

24:06.160 --> 24:07.640
I don't know what's happening to them

24:07.840 --> 24:09.280
and I'm very much concerned

24:09.480 --> 24:12.080
because maybe next time I may not be able to come here.

24:12.280 --> 24:15.640
I come all the way from London just to see them and what I find

24:15.840 --> 24:19.280
that they just take realization and finish off.

24:19.480 --> 24:23.440
It's a very sad thing and it should be so peculiar of this place

24:23.640 --> 24:25.520
that I can't understand what's the reason,

24:25.720 --> 24:27.480
why it happens.

24:27.960 --> 24:30.000
I went to Vienna where

24:30.200 --> 24:34.760
sixty people got realization in first shot

24:35.120 --> 24:37.080
and they are increasing.

24:37.280 --> 24:39.920
Every country is like that. Switzerland, if you go,

24:40.120 --> 24:42.480
there are at least thousand people who have got realization.

24:42.680 --> 24:44.960
Of course London because I have been there for eight years,

24:45.160 --> 24:47.800
so you can imagine there are lots of people who have got realization.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.760
But one has to know that after getting realization

24:50.960 --> 24:53.120
you should not just sit back and say no nothing doing.

24:53.320 --> 24:55.520
You have to see that your connection is established

24:55.720 --> 24:57.640
for which all the knowledge will be given to you

24:57.840 --> 25:00.720
and you see that you retain the position.

25:00.920 --> 25:02.960
It's a very small thing that is to be done.

25:03.160 --> 25:05.440
If you really respect yourself, your life

25:05.640 --> 25:07.800
as such as a human being

25:08.000 --> 25:09.400
as much as I respect it

25:09.600 --> 25:11.880
as much as I love.

25:12.080 --> 25:14.680
I am sure even one thousandth of that

25:14.880 --> 25:17.520
if you could understand what you are you would do it

25:17.720 --> 25:20.520
because you are nothing but the spirit,

25:20.720 --> 25:24.320
the spirit which is the joy the spirit which is the attention

25:24.520 --> 25:28.440
and the spirit that is the complete beauty

25:28.880 --> 25:30.240
this is what you have to be

25:30.440 --> 25:31.720
you don't call yourself ugly

25:31.920 --> 25:36.200
or don't feel at all unhappy that you haven't got this or that

25:36.400 --> 25:37.600
no inadequacy

25:37.800 --> 25:39.080
and no guilt.

25:39.280 --> 25:42.080
Nothing is going to stop you from getting realization.

25:42.320 --> 25:46.320
This is a day when I feel something should happen here

25:46.520 --> 25:49.960
also again and that people should really rise

25:50.200 --> 25:51.400
about petty things

25:51.600 --> 25:53.000
and get to themselves

25:53.200 --> 25:55.320
and develop their realization.

25:55.520 --> 25:59.200
Rome, imagine Rome a place like Rome we have so many Sahaja Yogis

25:59.400 --> 26:00.760
and here is somebody who has come

26:00.960 --> 26:04.200
now we are importing people from outside to come to Exeter

26:04.440 --> 26:07.040
because so many people in London got really fed up

26:07.240 --> 26:09.840
they just don't know what to do with the people in Exeter.

26:10.040 --> 26:14.320
Why, why are they not serious about their lives?

26:14.520 --> 26:17.760
So I would request you today please, for heaven's sake

26:18.200 --> 26:20.800
try to get your realization and establish yourself.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.320
Thank you very much! May God bless you!

26:23.520 --> 26:27.000
Will you please ask me questions. If there are any, I would like to answer them,

26:27.200 --> 26:28.720
but ask questions which are relevant

26:28.920 --> 26:31.240
and not somebody gurus as this and that.

26:31.440 --> 26:33.680
You see if you have got to say something

26:33.880 --> 26:35.560
you should find your own halls and say

26:35.760 --> 26:37.640
but not to represent here some guru.

26:37.840 --> 26:40.312
If he has given you something why here?

26:40.512 --> 26:41.902
Is a simple thing as that.

26:42.102 --> 26:46.062
I would like you to ask me questions which are relevant and sensible.

26:59.480 --> 27:00.480
No questions?

27:01.480 --> 27:02.182
Yes please!

27:02.382 --> 27:06.376
Seeker: Isn't the Kundalini a natural evolutionary process (inaudible)

27:06.576 --> 27:11.640
when a person reaches a certain point (inaudible) evolution (inaudible).

27:11.840 --> 27:13.240
Shri Mtataji: Yes it's true

27:13.440 --> 27:17.600
I agree, agreed with you that evolution happens up to the human stage,

27:17.800 --> 27:20.560
up to the human stage spontaneously is true,

27:20.960 --> 27:23.560
but at the stage of human beings, you see,

27:23.760 --> 27:26.320
we are specially made because we have lifted our head

27:26.520 --> 27:28.960
and this I-ness has come in to us, you see?

27:29.160 --> 27:32.080
The animals don't have that I-ness we have that I-ness.

27:32.280 --> 27:34.600
And because of that happening, what happens?

27:34.800 --> 27:39.240
That it the ego and superego meet here and get calcified

27:39.440 --> 27:42.200
and you become mister X, you become mister Y.

27:42.400 --> 27:45.520
So your awareness is very different from that of an animal.

27:45.720 --> 27:49.360
And in this awareness you must get that you have got your realization.

27:49.560 --> 27:52.000
If you don't get it you cannot use it.

27:52.200 --> 27:54.640
It cannot be like an animal to human being.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.400
It has to be of a

27:56.600 --> 28:00.760
of a nature that you know about it, you are aware of it.

28:00.960 --> 28:03.680
If you are not aware that you have got your realization,

28:03.880 --> 28:06.760
then you won't be able to use it further.

28:06.960 --> 28:10.488
That's why this is important that you should get it in your awareness.

28:10.688 --> 28:11.973
Very good question, I must say!

28:12.173 --> 28:18.800
Seeker: Too many books advising to do special breathing exercies.

28:19.080 --> 28:20.680
Shri Mataji: But breathing exercise...

28:20.880 --> 28:22.400
Seeker:  yet other books say...

28:22.600 --> 28:24.520
Shri Mattaji: Yes, I agree with you. It's very confusing.

28:24.720 --> 28:27.240
You are all right. It's very confusing I agree with you, you see.

28:27.440 --> 28:29.640
Whatever people say you shouldn't believe it.

28:29.840 --> 28:30.902
Now, you must see for you...

28:31.102 --> 28:33.458
Even what I say, you should not believe but keep yourself open.

28:33.658 --> 28:34.320
All right?

28:34.520 --> 28:36.680
Now, some say, you should do breathing exercise.

28:36.880 --> 28:38.360
Now,  you should think about it!

28:38.600 --> 28:40.600
You see by breathing, it's a living process.

28:40.800 --> 28:45.376
What I said, you come to right conclusion that evolutionary process is a living process, all right?

28:45.576 --> 28:47.651
So for living process,

28:47.851 --> 28:50.440
supposing you have to sow a seed, all right?

28:50.640 --> 28:54.040
What do you do? You take a seed and put it in the mother earth

28:54.240 --> 28:57.920
When you put it in the mother earth, she has the capacity to sprout it, all right?

28:58.120 --> 29:02.160
But supposing you... breathing exercises you do or do what ever you like,

29:02.360 --> 29:03.680
it won't, it won't come up.

29:03.880 --> 29:07.800
It will only come up if the person who has authority to enlighten you

29:08.000 --> 29:09.160
can enlighten you

29:09.400 --> 29:12.015
and then once you're enlightened you can enlighten another person.

29:12.215 --> 29:14.975
So that you can verify whether you are enlightened or not.

29:15.175 --> 29:16.680
You can see with your naked eyes

29:16.880 --> 29:18.040
the pulsation of the Kundalini,

29:18.240 --> 29:19.600
the rising of the Kundalini.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.960
You can. You can feel it with the stethoscope.

29:22.160 --> 29:25.181
It comes up on your head here and it breaks.

29:25.381 --> 29:27.760
When it breaks there the sound stops.

29:27.960 --> 29:29.200
You can hear (lab da)

29:29.400 --> 29:31.823
just like the heart beat going up

29:32.030 --> 29:35.390
and it breaks up here and you start feeling the cool breeze coming out of your head,

29:35.590 --> 29:38.302
But the transformation starts working out gradually within you,

29:38.502 --> 29:40.547
which you start seeing and you can verify it.

29:40.747 --> 29:45.152
So, you see - if you say that it is spontaneous, it should happen

29:45.400 --> 29:47.040
but at this stage it cannot,

29:47.240 --> 29:50.040
because you have to enter into the kingdom of God.

29:50.240 --> 29:52.720
You are special people, so you have to be aware of it.

29:52.920 --> 29:54.960
You should know that now I'm here everyone.

29:55.160 --> 29:59.400
We never knew till, till now Darwin put up this theory that we are have evolved, isn't it.

29:59.600 --> 30:02.200
We never knew that we have evolved from amoeba to this stage.

30:02.400 --> 30:05.400
That was all right but today you have to know,

30:05.800 --> 30:08.440
because that is the blessing of God which you should know.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.630
And you should know everything, not only that,

30:10.830 --> 30:12.280
but you should know what are these centers.

30:12.480 --> 30:13.391
How they work out,

30:13.591 --> 30:14.575
how you can handle them,

30:14.775 --> 30:15.831
how can arrange them,

30:16.031 --> 30:17.342
how can you give realization,

30:17.542 --> 30:20.040
how can you raise other's Kundalini. Everything you have to know

30:20.240 --> 30:22.200
Absolutely without paying anything.

30:22.400 --> 30:23.720
All this knowledge you have to have.

30:23.920 --> 30:26.640
Now for breathing. Somebody says you do breathing exercise.

30:26.840 --> 30:30.240
Now, that is also one has to do sometimes in Sahaja Yoga.

30:31.120 --> 30:34.200
But in Sahaja Yoga the first thing is the awakening of the Kundalini.

30:34.800 --> 30:36.760
Because supposing you have a problem

30:36.960 --> 30:38.600
of the center heart, as they call it.

30:38.800 --> 30:41.280
Now here you see the green one

30:41.480 --> 30:43.680
and the yellow one there's another center there.

30:43.880 --> 30:46.957
The green, you see, this green and that green

30:47.157 --> 30:49.640
there is another bluish center, if you see that center one.

30:49.840 --> 30:51.400
If that is out of order,

30:51.600 --> 30:54.120
then you have to do a kind of a breathing exercise.

30:54.320 --> 30:56.120
If that is out of order.

30:56.320 --> 30:57.596
Not otherwise.

30:57.796 --> 31:01.600
You see, it is the way we are doing everything is indiscriminate.

31:01.800 --> 31:05.880
We try to do something which is not necessary

31:06.400 --> 31:08.120
or which is which has no relationship

31:08.320 --> 31:10.320
to our troubles for our weaknesses.

31:10.520 --> 31:13.360
It is like supposing, now I have to go to London.

31:13.560 --> 31:16.800
Now, I don't know how the traffic is going to be on the way, all right?

31:17.000 --> 31:18.960
So I, I before hand,

31:19.160 --> 31:22.720
if I started pushing for the traffic is absurd

31:22.920 --> 31:24.280
because I am not yet facing it.

31:24.480 --> 31:26.800
When the Kundalini moves then only you will know

31:27.000 --> 31:28.080
where the problem is

31:28.280 --> 31:29.920
and then you should try to solve it.

31:30.120 --> 31:34.400
If it is at a lower, lower centers

31:34.600 --> 31:36.840
or at the higher centers you have to do something else.

31:37.080 --> 31:40.160
All the exercises that are told

31:40.800 --> 31:42.760
in the path Anjali Yoga Shastra

31:42.960 --> 31:45.080
are just a wee bit of the whole thing.

31:45.400 --> 31:51.120
There are Astangas there are eight Angas of the yoga.

31:51.320 --> 31:53.640
Out of that one

31:53.840 --> 31:55.480
one of them has got Yama-Niyama,

31:55.680 --> 31:58.520
out of which one-third are the exercises.

31:58.720 --> 32:02.240
These exercises only correct the backbone

32:02.560 --> 32:03.760
the physical side of it,

32:03.960 --> 32:05.200
not the subtler side of it.

32:05.400 --> 32:08.320
So, when you just start looking after your health

32:08.520 --> 32:12.120
or say your physical side you neglect your emotional side.

32:12.520 --> 32:15.040
A person who looks after his health too much

32:15.240 --> 32:17.760
can be a very dry person - absolutely feelingless.

32:17.960 --> 32:19.960
He can become absolutely feelingless.

32:20.160 --> 32:23.960
If somebody dies you won't feel anything, anything. "I become a great saint."

32:24.160 --> 32:25.480
But he'll be a hot-tempered fellow,

32:25.680 --> 32:26.760
extremely hot-tempered.

32:26.960 --> 32:28.640
You can't go near him.

32:28.880 --> 32:31.440
If you go near and very much he may bark or may bite you.

32:31.640 --> 32:33.280
So that sort of a thing might happen.

32:33.480 --> 32:37.920
So you have to understand, in complete integration,

32:38.160 --> 32:39.400
where is the problem,

32:39.600 --> 32:40.920
what is the problem

32:41.200 --> 32:42.880
and what is the treatment needed?

32:43.080 --> 32:46.000
But once it happens to you, then only you will know.

32:46.200 --> 32:49.320
You can verify it, one after another.

32:49.560 --> 32:51.720
So this is what it is. You have to know about it.

32:51.960 --> 32:54.800
Everything you must know, why you are doing what.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.480
This, why you have to do it,

32:56.680 --> 32:59.400
what is the need to do this, what is to need to do that.

32:59.600 --> 33:01.880
But if somebody tells you: "Just do this!

33:02.080 --> 33:03.800
Stand on your heads!" You start doing that.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.760
Why? Why should we stand on our heads?

33:05.960 --> 33:07.680
What is the need to stand on our heads?

33:07.880 --> 33:10.200
Everything should be logical, as I said,

33:10.400 --> 33:12.635
but once you get your realization

33:12.879 --> 33:14.640
the whole thing becomes so logical,

33:14.840 --> 33:17.481
because you start understanding the laws of the Divine.

33:17.681 --> 33:19.840
Once you understand those laws, then you know,

33:20.040 --> 33:22.080
by doing what, you get what.

33:22.520 --> 33:25.320
For example leukemia. A disease like leukemia,

33:25.520 --> 33:26.920
we have cured

33:27.120 --> 33:29.320
and we can cure leucemia a very easily.

33:29.520 --> 33:31.440
Cancer can be cured also.

33:31.800 --> 33:33.520
Now how leucemia is caused?

33:33.880 --> 33:35.640
Perhaps people do not know.

33:35.880 --> 33:40.800
Is caused because a person is very hasty very speedy.

33:41.072 --> 33:42.243
Very is ( ) sort of ( ).

33:42.443 --> 33:45.255
In the morning he takes his breakfast in his hand,

33:45.455 --> 33:46.480
sits on his car

33:46.680 --> 33:50.400
and all the time  is, you seen, in a haste, going for his work

33:50.600 --> 33:54.080
and there's a jam on the way and he's absolutely upset.

33:54.280 --> 33:56.280
This spleen which is on the left-hand side,

33:56.480 --> 34:02.600
you see, has to produce red blood corpuscles for your emergencies

34:02.800 --> 34:05.200
and it becomes crazy, it becomes absolutely crazy.

34:05.440 --> 34:09.720
It doesn't know what to do with the person who's doing three, four simultaneously (inaudible).

34:09.920 --> 34:13.960
When it becomes crazy the situation is created.

34:14.160 --> 34:16.560
The situation for leukemia is created.

34:16.760 --> 34:18.200
And if it is triggered

34:18.480 --> 34:20.480
as a doctor they call it -

34:20.680 --> 34:24.800
they call it as protein 58, protein 52.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.840
Because doctors are honest they don't want to say more than what they know.

34:29.080 --> 34:31.520
But when we know, we can tell you, that what it is.

34:31.720 --> 34:34.920
They say that these proteins entered into us

34:35.120 --> 34:37.800
and they triggered the cancer.

34:38.280 --> 34:39.760
Now what are these proteins?

34:39.960 --> 34:44.440
They say that they come from an area which is built with us since our creation.

34:44.640 --> 34:46.520
We call it as collective subconscious.

34:46.720 --> 34:48.160
All those things you will know,

34:48.360 --> 34:49.200
how they trigger,

34:49.400 --> 34:51.640
how they come in and what happens to you.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.720
It is very simple to understand

34:53.920 --> 34:57.680
because here we are dealing with the principles which created.

34:57.880 --> 35:00.160
Once it gets out of principles

35:00.360 --> 35:02.600
then it gets on, you see, complicated.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.600
But if you know how to handle the principle,

35:04.800 --> 35:06.440
you can correct it and can manage it.

35:06.640 --> 35:07.560
It is a fact.

35:07.760 --> 35:09.320
You can verify it yourself.

35:09.520 --> 35:13.480
And you have to verify it, keep your mind open and see for yourself.

35:14.040 --> 35:16.960
All right, thank you.

35:24.440 --> 35:26.320
Should we have the experience now?

35:26.600 --> 35:27.440
All right!

35:27.640 --> 35:30.080
But you all have to promise me that I will work it out

35:30.280 --> 35:31.720
but you must continue with it.

35:31.920 --> 35:33.280
You should not just give it that way,

35:33.480 --> 35:35.560
because that's not good that's very, very sad.

35:35.760 --> 35:38.160
As Christ has said a parable

35:38.440 --> 35:41.080
that some seeds fell on the rocks.

35:41.880 --> 35:44.960
I saw a beautiful red rocks near Exeter.

35:45.480 --> 35:49.320
I hope also there is very beautiful soil,

35:49.520 --> 35:51.000
which is red and nice.

35:51.200 --> 35:53.520
I saw very good barley fields and other fields.

35:53.720 --> 35:55.080
I hope there are people

35:55.280 --> 35:57.400
who will receive realization

35:57.600 --> 36:02.160
as sprout into beautiful trees of Sahaja Yoga.

36:02.480 --> 36:04.880
May God bless you.

36:06.560 --> 36:08.400
You have to just, now again I'll tell you,

36:08.600 --> 36:10.760
you have to do few things which are simple.

36:10.960 --> 36:11.960
You have to take out your shoes.

36:12.160 --> 36:14.480
For one reason that the mother earth helps us

36:14.680 --> 36:15.920
to suck in the problem, you see?

36:16.120 --> 36:18.560
So just take out your shoes.

36:19.640 --> 36:23.400
Nothing extraordinary has to be done.

36:24.720 --> 36:27.160
Those people can come forward.

36:37.480 --> 36:39.280
How are you today? Are you feeling all right?

36:39.480 --> 36:40.920
This gentleman.

36:41.720 --> 36:43.240
Are you all right?

36:43.800 --> 36:45.480
How are you feeling?

36:46.120 --> 36:46.920
You came!

36:47.120 --> 36:47.600
Seeker: Yeah

36:47.800 --> 36:48.440
Shri Mataji: How are you?

36:48.640 --> 36:49.640
Seeker: I try again.

36:50.960 --> 36:52.640
Shri Mataji: All right.

36:58.080 --> 36:59.835
Just put your hands like this.

37:00.035 --> 37:01.035
It's your own.

37:01.241 --> 37:04.068
I mean you should be cheerful about, absolutely cheerful.

37:04.268 --> 37:08.143
It is just there. You've to find it. That is all.

37:08.744 --> 37:11.664
This is your property which you are going to have.

37:11.960 --> 37:13.480
There's no obligation, nothing.

37:13.680 --> 37:15.200
It's just your own.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.136
Be cheerful about it!

37:17.336 --> 37:19.646
There is nothing to be frightened, nothing is going to happen.

37:19.846 --> 37:20.894
It's very simple.

37:21.094 --> 37:23.816
Just put your hands like this.

37:25.352 --> 37:27.672
Close your eyes! Please close your eyes.

37:27.880 --> 37:30.552
Now don't open your eyes still I tell you, because

37:30.752 --> 37:34.392
the Kundalini doesn't rise above a certain center of Agnya

37:34.640 --> 37:37.800
if your eyes are open out, so please keep them closed.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.920
This just see, this is against hypnotism

37:41.120 --> 37:44.293
where they put some spirits through eyes.

37:44.493 --> 37:46.143
So keep your eyes shut.

37:46.343 --> 37:49.400
Because there is dilatation of the pupil when the Kundalini rises

37:49.600 --> 37:53.717
and if the Kundalini is the eyes are not closed it stops at a point.

37:53.917 --> 37:55.031
So just help yourself.

37:55.231 --> 37:57.840
Little bit cooperate with me and it will work out.

37:58.040 --> 38:00.240
I am sure it will work out.

38:00.520 --> 38:02.400
Just cooperate with me a little bit.

38:02.600 --> 38:04.240
Put both the hands towards me.

38:04.440 --> 38:06.360
Just like this, put both the hands.

38:06.560 --> 38:09.600
If you have anything tight on your body you can loosen it a little bit

38:09.800 --> 38:12.080
and be comfortable. You have to be comfortable.

38:12.280 --> 38:17.120
If anything tight on your body just loosen it, if possible.

38:17.360 --> 38:19.400
Put both the hands towards me.

38:22.760 --> 38:24.360
Just like that.

38:25.055 --> 38:27.535
Keep your eyes shut please.

38:28.680 --> 38:31.000
Now the first thing I have to request you,

38:31.240 --> 38:32.240
that you have to say:

38:32.440 --> 38:33.840
"Mother, I am not guilty."

38:34.040 --> 38:35.720
This you say it, at least three times.

38:35.920 --> 38:37.960
With complete confidence,

38:38.160 --> 38:41.400
with complete belief in yourself that you are not guilty.

38:41.600 --> 38:44.920
Because whatever guilt you think of, it's just a speck.

38:45.120 --> 38:46.800
I'm talking about God

38:47.000 --> 38:49.040
who is the ocean of love,

38:49.640 --> 38:51.120
the ocean of compassion,

38:51.320 --> 38:52.280
ocean of forgiveness.

38:52.480 --> 38:54.400
Whatever you have done just forget it

38:54.600 --> 38:56.000
and say: "Mother, I am not guilty."

38:56.200 --> 38:57.800
First of all you must respect yourself.

38:58.000 --> 39:01.280
If you don't respect yourself it's not going to work out.

39:01.480 --> 39:04.080
Just say: "Mother, I am not guilty."

39:10.000 --> 39:13.040
Three times to say: "Mother, I am not guilty."

39:25.200 --> 39:28.094
Already some people must have started feeling the cool breeze.

39:28.294 --> 39:31.414
Today vibrations are too much.

39:34.440 --> 39:37.400
Now you put your right hand on your heart.

39:40.200 --> 39:41.840
Now ask me a question

39:42.040 --> 39:44.560
"Mother, am I the spirit?"

39:44.760 --> 39:46.440
Ask me a question thrice please.

39:46.640 --> 39:48.720
Just ask me a question with confidence:

39:48.920 --> 39:51.640
"Mother, am I the spirit?"

40:06.280 --> 40:07.640
Now bring that hand down.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.720
You have already started feeling the cool breeze?

40:17.280 --> 40:22.160
Down below - you bring that hand down below on the left hand side on your stomach.

40:24.080 --> 40:25.960
Now here at this point

40:26.160 --> 40:28.640
you have to say, ask a question again:

40:28.840 --> 40:33.542
"Mother, am I my own master? Am I my own guru?"

40:35.360 --> 40:36.760
Because you are!

40:36.960 --> 40:38.840
But just ask the question.

40:39.040 --> 40:43.120
By asking the question the center starts working.

40:47.400 --> 40:50.360
In a humble way, please ask in a humble way

40:50.560 --> 40:53.760
"Mother, am I my own guru?"

41:02.200 --> 41:06.120
Now raise it again, the hand, to your heart

41:06.600 --> 41:11.600
and say: "Mother, I am the spirit."

41:20.000 --> 41:24.200
Now say it 12 times.

41:29.120 --> 41:31.360
With full confidence.

41:31.560 --> 41:35.760
With full confidence say it: "Mother, I am the spirit."

41:49.480 --> 41:54.880
Now put this right hand on the left-hand side of your neck.

41:58.960 --> 42:00.920
Now say: "Mother, I am not guilty."

42:01.120 --> 42:02.400
Say it sixteen times

42:02.600 --> 42:05.840
because this is the punishment for feeling guilty.

42:07.440 --> 42:10.174
It is the worst center all of you have got.

42:10.374 --> 42:15.374
I don't know why you sit down and start feeling guilty for nothing at all.

42:45.080 --> 42:48.280
Now put your right hand again across your forehead,

42:48.480 --> 42:50.960
across your forehead.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.880
And just say one thing twice:

42:55.080 --> 42:57.240
"Mother," - genuinely honestly -

42:57.440 --> 42:58.600
"I forgive everyone."

42:58.800 --> 43:01.520
You have to be honest. If you are dishonest it won't work out.

43:01.720 --> 43:05.440
"Mother, I forgive everyone."

43:05.800 --> 43:09.040
Genuinely, please say that.

43:14.400 --> 43:19.120
This is how I'm teaching you also how to raise your own Kundalini

43:20.360 --> 43:23.560
"I forgive everyone."

43:26.800 --> 43:28.240
Say it twice.

43:28.440 --> 43:30.840
Absolutely genuinely you say it.

43:31.040 --> 43:34.200
"I forgive everyone."

43:34.840 --> 43:37.280
Now put this hand on your head.

43:37.480 --> 43:40.120
Resting on your head in the center.

43:40.600 --> 43:43.840
Try to press it and see if it is hot or cold.

43:44.040 --> 43:45.040
Just see.

43:45.400 --> 43:47.480
At this point

43:47.920 --> 43:49.200
I have to request you

43:49.400 --> 43:52.760
because I cannot get over your freedom.

43:52.960 --> 43:54.160
I can not!

43:54.360 --> 43:56.760
You have to ask for your realization.

43:56.960 --> 43:59.080
I cannot just force you down into it,

43:59.280 --> 44:01.480
so you have to say:

44:02.080 --> 44:04.360
"Mother, please give me my realization."

44:04.560 --> 44:06.360
Just say that at that point.

44:06.560 --> 44:08.480
Unless and until you ask for it I cannot do it.

44:08.680 --> 44:10.520
I just can't do it.

44:10.960 --> 44:13.360
I cannot force you into it.

44:13.560 --> 44:15.279
Press the hand

44:15.625 --> 44:16.739
hard,

44:16.939 --> 44:19.007
hard you press it.

44:23.991 --> 44:27.591
You can press it with fingers if you want.

44:29.480 --> 44:33.200
Now raise your hand and see if there's a cool breeze coming out.

44:34.560 --> 44:36.480
If not put your right hand

44:36.680 --> 44:38.275
and with the left hand you can feel it.

44:38.475 --> 44:40.809
See if there's a cool breeze coming out.

44:55.080 --> 44:56.498
Normally people should feel it

44:56.698 --> 44:59.166
but if you are complicated is rather difficult.

44:59.366 --> 45:01.326
But normally you should.

45:02.440 --> 45:04.800
Whole left is catching.

45:15.840 --> 45:19.360
Put your another hand and see.

45:29.120 --> 45:32.720
Will the Sahaja Yogi's see some of the people?

45:33.280 --> 45:35.400
Because I'm in a hurry to go today, so just -

45:35.600 --> 45:36.760
let's see if you can finish.

45:36.960 --> 45:38.880
See this gentleman maybe. Yes, I don't know.

45:39.080 --> 45:42.240
This one has asked right questions, no doubt.

45:52.320 --> 45:54.800
Yes, they did feel, he did feel. Yes.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.840
What about...?
