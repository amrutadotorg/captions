00:00:00.032 --> 00:00:03.476
Shri Mataji has a big following in Turkey.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.534
Healthy Life Association members are
 Her representatives in Turkey.

00:00:07.544 --> 00:00:13.041
Since 3 years this association is trying
 to spread Sahaja Yoga in Turkey.

00:00:13.097 --> 00:00:16.694
Everyone has a hidden energy inside.

00:00:16.735 --> 00:00:19.493
This energy resides in a triangler bone.

00:00:19.525 --> 00:00:23.745
When this enegy gets awakened, it passes through 
the six centers in the nervous system

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.734
and comes out through 
the seventh center in the head.

00:00:25.774 --> 00:00:29.300
Then it connects with the Cosmos
 and with God.

00:00:29.342 --> 00:00:33.900
Our aim is to awaken this energy.

00:00:34.792 --> 00:00:38.873
The meaning of Sahaja Yoga is to connect 
with the Power of God`s Love.

00:00:38.897 --> 00:00:42.923
The main aim is to awaken 
the energy called Kundalini.

00:00:42.965 --> 00:00:47.586
According to Shri Mataji, Turks are 
very close to spirituel enligtenment.

00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:50.639
Turks come from sufis.

00:00:50.664 --> 00:00:53.371
First of all, they have to 
get their realization.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.447
If they get realization, 
they can cope with everything.

00:00:57.476 --> 00:01:00.906
Shri Mataji says that the only way
 to understand Sahaja Yoga is

00:01:00.922 --> 00:01:03.898
to enter into the state of meditation

00:01:03.946 --> 00:01:05.622
and She takes us in front.

00:01:05.647 --> 00:01:08.642
The master of meditation says that
 the holy air that permeates

00:01:08.682 --> 00:01:11.065
 the Universe exists also around the people.

00:01:11.081 --> 00:01:17.316
According to Her teaching, to feel a breez
e is a step towards realization.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.567
You feel very peacefull with in, 
absolutely peacefull.

00:01:20.586 --> 00:01:25.524
Shri Mataji, the symbol of Sahaja Yoga,
 is leaving Istanbul on Sunday

00:01:25.541 --> 00:01:28.846
but the Healthy Life Association keeps
Shri Mataji`s  teaching,

00:01:28.875 --> 00:01:34.660
 giving lessons in their centers in
 Istanbul and Ankara.

00:01:34.773 --> 00:01:39.858
Indian Yoga master Shri Mataji
came to Istanbul for a seminar.

00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:52.339
There are many followers of 78 years old Shri Mataji`s system
 of awakening the energy in people, i.e. realization in Turkey

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.691
When you are born,
 you have an energy inside you.

00:01:57.717 --> 00:02:01.705
This energy resides in the triangle bone 
at the base of the spine.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.811
Thousands of years ago,
 people do know about this bone.

00:02:03.836 --> 00:02:06.400
Neither do they know that they have 
an energy inside this bone.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.475
When this energy awakens,
 it passes through the six energy centers

00:02:10.507 --> 00:02:14.622
in the parasympathetic nervous system
 and above our head,

00:02:14.655 --> 00:02:18.268
it connects us to all pervading power called Ruh.

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.033
Among Shri Mataji`s followers in Turkey, 
there are many famous people.

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:25.523
Shri Mataji says that Turks are simple and relaxed.

00:02:25.548 --> 00:02:26.976
Wonderful people,

00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:30.843
I would say they are maybe among the best.

00:02:30.868 --> 00:02:35.920
Shri Mataji says that Turkey will easily come out
 of the economic crisis it is currently in.

00:02:35.944 --> 00:02:39.164
First of all, by the grace of God,

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.497
then thanks to realiazed souls

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:44.860
and there are many realiazed souls in Turkey,

00:02:44.876 --> 00:02:50.220
people will find again happiness 
and peace within and without.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.503
Shri Mataji says that people find 
purity and truth in Her,

00:02:54.528 --> 00:02:58.873
She has some warnings to the
 Economy Minister Kemal Dervish.

00:02:58.986 --> 00:03:03.028
I have seen his photograph, 
he is very hard working

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.826
 but I think,he should be a little more relaxed

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.860
because working too hard is harmful to 
the heart and makes it tired.

00:03:09.884 --> 00:03:11.911
He should pay attention to himself

00:03:11.928 --> 00:03:14.112
because he is a very precious person.

00:03:14.144 --> 00:03:20.744
Shri Mataji also gives realization to us 
that is She awakens our inner energy.

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.936
You will be understand, what is all these, 
your hands are  speaking.
