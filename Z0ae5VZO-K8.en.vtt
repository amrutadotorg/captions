00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.452
So today is a day when you have to promise Me

00:00:11.554 --> 00:00:14.454
that you’ll meditate every night,

00:00:14.554 --> 00:00:17.514
every evening, maybe in the morning also.

00:00:17.628 --> 00:00:21.734
Whenever it is possible if you can go into a meditative mood,

00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:27.314
you are in contact with this Divine power.

00:00:27.634 --> 00:00:33.414
Then, whatever is good for you, whatever good for your society,

00:00:33.514 --> 00:00:39.135
for your country, all is done by this Divine power.

00:00:39.278 --> 00:00:42.714
You don’t have to overpower the Divine power,

00:00:42.994 --> 00:00:45.754
you don’t have to order, you don’t have to ask,

00:00:46.074 --> 00:00:53.334
just if you meditate you are one with this All-pervading Power

00:00:53.434 --> 00:00:58.434
which is another great blessing to us.

00:00:59.828 --> 00:01:03.970
Unless and until your Sahasrara is opened

00:01:04.074 --> 00:01:10.534
all the blessings of the Divine power cannot come to you, cannot.

00:01:10.634 --> 00:01:14.294
Maybe you might get some money, you might get some jobs,

00:01:14.394 --> 00:01:16.314
you might get this and that.

00:01:16.554 --> 00:01:20.534
But your own development is only possible when you meditate

00:01:20.634 --> 00:01:26.834
and your Sahasrara is completely open and open to truth.

00:01:27.114 --> 00:01:34.514
Now the truth is that this Divine power is compassion, is love.

00:01:34.874 --> 00:01:37.074
This is the truth.

00:01:37.078 --> 00:01:39.834
They say God is love and God is truth,

00:01:40.074 --> 00:01:45.394
so the equation has to be made that truth is love and love is truth.

00:01:45.507 --> 00:01:48.847
But it’s not a truth that, as you have for your own children,

00:01:49.074 --> 00:01:51.874
you have for your family, attached.

00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:55.066
Attached love is not truth.

00:01:55.434 --> 00:01:57.414
If you are attached to somebody

00:01:57.514 --> 00:02:01.334
then you never see the bad points of that person.

00:02:01.434 --> 00:02:03.454
If you are angry with somebody,

00:02:03.554 --> 00:02:06.774
then you can never see the good points of that person.

00:02:06.874 --> 00:02:11.014
But it’s a complete detached love

00:02:11.114 --> 00:02:14.434
and that love is extremely powerful

00:02:14.794 --> 00:02:19.214
because whenever you project that love to anyone,

00:02:19.314 --> 00:02:22.774
you’ll be surprised, the problems of that person will be solved,

00:02:22.874 --> 00:02:24.816
his personality will improve,

00:02:24.954 --> 00:02:29.994
everything will work out in a very big way and his life will be changed.

00:02:30.242 --> 00:02:34.998
But if you’re attached to anything whatsoever,

00:02:35.482 --> 00:02:46.650
that attachment itself causes problems and doesn’t allow Sahaj to grow.

00:02:46.811 --> 00:02:51.311
This attachment could be any kind, for example,

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:55.503
you can be attached to your country, attached to your society,

00:02:55.554 --> 00:02:58.514
attached to your family, it can be of any kind.

00:02:58.635 --> 00:03:03.916
But when Sahasrara is open, you’ll learn one thing, is detachment.

00:03:03.996 --> 00:03:06.297
It just happens that you get detached.

00:03:06.434 --> 00:03:09.779
Though, I mean, you are not running away.

00:03:09.874 --> 00:03:14.067
As it is in Sahaja Yoga we don’t believe in people who run away

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:19.145
from society and go to Himalayas, all that I call escapism,

00:03:19.216 --> 00:03:20.589
that is not the point.

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:26.060
What happens is that you are there, you see everyone,

00:03:26.155 --> 00:03:30.033
you watch everyone, you know everyone,

00:03:30.095 --> 00:03:34.921
you are close to everyone, but you are a detached person.

00:03:35.074 --> 00:03:40.093
It’s a state of mind that you achieve when Sahasrara is open.

00:03:40.194 --> 00:03:44.936
In that state you are dealing with people,

00:03:45.074 --> 00:03:49.814
you are dealing with problems, you are dealing with situations,

00:03:49.914 --> 00:03:55.354
but you are not involved in it, there’s no involvement;

00:03:55.475 --> 00:03:58.630
and that involvement which you had before

00:03:58.754 --> 00:04:03.659
can never give a complete insight, what is happening,

00:04:03.691 --> 00:04:06.775
what the truth is, about any situation.

00:04:06.874 --> 00:04:09.756
So this detachment helps.

00:04:09.835 --> 00:04:15.801
The greatest thing of the detachment is that you are not affected.

00:04:15.914 --> 00:04:20.174
No use saying that, “oh you are not affected,

00:04:20.274 --> 00:04:26.175
Mother, so how can you feel for another person?

00:04:26.274 --> 00:04:30.580
How can you have compassion for another person?

00:04:30.618 --> 00:04:34.941
Because if you feel for another person

00:04:35.034 --> 00:04:38.154
then only you can solve the problem”.

00:04:38.187 --> 00:04:43.501
But this feeling that you have is again a kind of an attachment.

00:04:43.594 --> 00:04:50.209
It is not a real feeling, because it doesn’t help.

00:04:50.288 --> 00:04:52.714
The person is crying, you are also crying,

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:55.494
the person is trouble, you are also in trouble.

00:04:55.594 --> 00:05:01.044
And this does not help that person, nor will it help you.

00:05:01.114 --> 00:05:05.014
So to have detached in no way means

00:05:05.114 --> 00:05:09.409
you do not feel for another person.

00:05:09.481 --> 00:05:10.854
You do feel.

00:05:10.954 --> 00:05:16.599
You feel the agony of that person, the trouble of that person,

00:05:16.734 --> 00:05:21.601
of the whole society sometimes and of the whole country.

00:05:21.714 --> 00:05:25.077
But that your feeling is so detached

00:05:25.154 --> 00:05:30.234
that the All-pervading Power takes over.

00:05:30.315 --> 00:05:32.541
First we must have full faith

00:05:32.594 --> 00:05:36.903
in the capability of this All-pervading Power.

00:05:36.963 --> 00:05:39.318
As soon as you are detached.

00:05:39.362 --> 00:05:43.142
You say, “You do it” - finished.

00:05:43.205 --> 00:05:45.650
Once you say that, “You are going to do it,

00:05:45.714 --> 00:05:47.834
it’s You who is going to do it,”

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:50.057
whole thing changes completely.

00:05:50.154 --> 00:05:54.934
Because you transfer all your responsibilities, all your problems,

00:05:55.034 --> 00:05:58.374
to this Divine power, which is so powerful,

00:05:58.474 --> 00:06:03.600
which is so capable, which can work out anything.

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:08.952
So whenever you think that this problem you are going to solve,

00:06:09.034 --> 00:06:11.440
you are the one who’s going to do it,

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:17.167
then, alright, the Divine power says: “Alright, try your luck.”

00:06:17.234 --> 00:06:21.087
But if you can really put this problem to the Divine power,

00:06:21.158 --> 00:06:22.814
it will work out.

00:06:22.914 --> 00:06:26.034
We have all kinds of problems in Sahaja Yoga,

00:06:26.155 --> 00:06:29.708
especially when we find that people

00:06:29.772 --> 00:06:32.465
are not so much attracted to Sahaja Yoga,

00:06:32.554 --> 00:06:35.954
they are few in number then you feel very bad about it.

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:39.325
But have you tried to meditate on this point,

00:06:39.394 --> 00:06:44.268
and have you tried to put this problem to the Divine power?

00:06:44.324 --> 00:06:46.054
Why should we worry?

00:06:46.066 --> 00:06:49.200
When we have Divine power available through our Sahasrara,

00:06:49.255 --> 00:06:50.374
why should we worry?

00:06:50.474 --> 00:06:52.614
Why should we think about it?

00:06:52.665 --> 00:06:56.118
Just leave it to the Divine power.

00:06:56.154 --> 00:07:00.354
If that is possible, if that you can achieve,

00:07:00.435 --> 00:07:03.234
which is very difficult for human beings,

00:07:03.356 --> 00:07:05.753
because they live with their ego,

00:07:05.793 --> 00:07:07.714
they live with their conditionings;

00:07:07.795 --> 00:07:12.858
but if that attachment to all these things goes away,

00:07:12.954 --> 00:07:18.274
then what you do is just leave things to this power.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.146
Krishna has said in His Gita:

00:07:21.234 --> 00:07:24.954
“Sarva dharmanam parityajya mamekam sharanam vraja”

00:07:25.059 --> 00:07:26.832
“Forget about all your dharmas”.

00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:31.674
Dharmas means, He means, meaning that we have a dharma of a wife,

00:07:31.827 --> 00:07:36.178
of a husband, of a member of the society,

00:07:36.274 --> 00:07:38.519
all of them have their own dharma.

00:07:38.594 --> 00:07:44.037
But He says “Leave them. And leave it, them to Me and I’ll manage.”

00:07:44.154 --> 00:07:47.607
This is it what we have to learn, is to say that

00:07:47.674 --> 00:07:52.160
“It’s this Divine power which will solve our problems.”

00:07:52.308 --> 00:07:55.628
As human beings it’s a very difficult state

00:07:55.755 --> 00:07:59.895
and this state only can be achieved through meditation.

00:07:59.954 --> 00:08:03.734
But I’m not saying that you go on meditating for hours together.

00:08:03.781 --> 00:08:05.233
That’s not necessary.

00:08:05.274 --> 00:08:10.934
But with full faith in yourself and in the Divine power.

00:08:11.034 --> 00:08:14.294
If you work it out, I’m sure it’s not difficult

00:08:14.394 --> 00:08:18.594
to rise to that state of consciousness.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:21.904
That is what we have to achieve.

00:08:21.952 --> 00:08:25.396
It’s possible for men as well as for women.

00:08:25.476 --> 00:08:29.232
They don’t have to think: “How can we, Mother, do it after all?”

00:08:29.354 --> 00:08:32.594
You see, all such people are no good for Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:32.707 --> 00:08:38.668
Those who have diffidence about themselves cannot do anything.

00:08:38.747 --> 00:08:43.327
But those who are surrendered and those who think they can do it,

00:08:43.474 --> 00:08:53.156
can manage all this transfer of their power to the Divine power.

00:08:53.274 --> 00:08:55.054
Just put it on the Divine power.

00:08:55.154 --> 00:09:00.022
Now supposing I have a car which can drive Me down.

00:09:00.089 --> 00:09:04.585
So, if I have a car then I don’t put bullocks on it,

00:09:04.714 --> 00:09:10.574
that I don’t push My car, I just sit inside and use it.

00:09:10.674 --> 00:09:15.050
In the same way, if you have this great power around you,

00:09:15.154 --> 00:09:20.383
if your Sahasrara is absolutely, completely submerged in it,

00:09:20.514 --> 00:09:26.883
then you’ll be amazed how things work out for yourself.

00:09:27.763 --> 00:09:32.074
I will give you an example of a Sahaja Yogi, he’s no more now,

00:09:32.154 --> 00:09:36.594
he was a fisherman, ordinary fisherman, but also he was educated,

00:09:36.635 --> 00:09:39.992
so he was working in a bank.

00:09:40.071 --> 00:09:43.914
This one was going one day to do some Sahaja Yoga work

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.338
and he had to go by boat.

00:09:46.429 --> 00:09:50.084
So when he came out he saw that the whole place was clouded

00:09:50.194 --> 00:09:53.814
and it was about to burst out into a big havoc.

00:09:53.914 --> 00:10:00.831
So he got very much perturbed about it that – “what is this?”

00:10:00.907 --> 00:10:05.589
Immediately, his Sahasrara was so open and good, immediately he said,

00:10:05.703 --> 00:10:08.834
“Now I leave it to this Divine power

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.169
to stop all these things happening.

00:10:12.274 --> 00:10:15.669
I don’t want it to rain and to have any problem

00:10:15.754 --> 00:10:19.336
till I come back home and go off to sleep”.

00:10:19.394 --> 00:10:22.854
And it was surprising, people told Me that

00:10:22.954 --> 00:10:26.306
“Mother, the clouds and everything were there

00:10:26.372 --> 00:10:32.456
all throughout but it did not rain, did not do anything,

00:10:32.594 --> 00:10:35.861
and there was no chaos of any kind”.

00:10:35.914 --> 00:10:38.885
He went to another island where he had to go,

00:10:38.964 --> 00:10:41.456
he did Sahaja Yoga and came back.

00:10:41.528 --> 00:10:44.258
And then when he went to sleep, then only,

00:10:44.354 --> 00:10:46.514
everything started pouring down.

00:10:46.603 --> 00:10:51.660
So, nature, everything, every leaf, every flower, everything,

00:10:51.764 --> 00:10:54.938
is worked out through the Divine power.

00:10:55.034 --> 00:10:59.074
So we should not have our ego that we can do something ourselves,

00:10:59.163 --> 00:11:00.899
we can manage ourselves.

00:11:00.954 --> 00:11:02.910
Once you have that kind of a thing,

00:11:02.974 --> 00:11:04.934
you are not yet that much developed,

00:11:05.034 --> 00:11:08.664
you are not that much grown up in Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:08.752 --> 00:11:12.734
But to grow up in Sahaja Yoga should not be difficult for you,

00:11:12.834 --> 00:11:15.633
because you have guidelines.

00:11:15.696 --> 00:11:20.268
Those people who got their realization, very few of them,

00:11:20.314 --> 00:11:24.514
like Sufis and we had some saints in India, all of them;

00:11:24.604 --> 00:11:26.382
how much they must have struggled.

00:11:26.469 --> 00:11:29.217
Nobody to guide them, nobody to help them,

00:11:29.274 --> 00:11:32.594
nobody to tell them about what they can achieve.

00:11:32.669 --> 00:11:37.670
And despite that they were very satisfied people,

00:11:37.772 --> 00:11:41.353
very happy people, and they worked it out so well.

00:11:41.467 --> 00:11:46.964
They saw the whole world with another angle, as you can also see,

00:11:47.028 --> 00:11:50.821
but they were not upset and they had such self-confidence,

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:56.937
they had such knowledge of their own

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.175
that they achieved through their meditative process.

00:12:01.274 --> 00:12:02.934
And the way they have written books,

00:12:03.034 --> 00:12:06.286
some of them are so great, it’s very surprisingly,

00:12:06.321 --> 00:12:14.558
how they have achieved these great verses, such full of knowledge.

00:12:14.627 --> 00:12:19.360
One cannot understand that they had no guidance,

00:12:19.434 --> 00:12:22.463
nobody was to tell them.

00:12:22.558 --> 00:12:24.883
But one thing with them was

00:12:24.954 --> 00:12:30.748
that they always tried to look after their Sahasrara.

00:12:30.834 --> 00:12:34.367
Now one thing is there obstructing Sahasrara

00:12:34.443 --> 00:12:40.360
is the movement of your Agnya into thoughts.

00:12:40.434 --> 00:12:44.334
That’s the only thing, that’s the only thing

00:12:44.434 --> 00:12:47.544
that stops your entry into Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:47.694 --> 00:12:51.885
Thoughts are coming all the time,

00:12:51.954 --> 00:12:56.274
because a human being is born who reacts to everything,

00:12:56.324 --> 00:12:58.188
react to this and react to that

00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:01.334
and the thoughts come in and the thoughts go.

00:13:01.378 --> 00:13:03.379
There’s a big crowd of thoughts.

00:13:03.434 --> 00:13:07.434
Because of that your attention cannot cross over Agnya

00:13:07.514 --> 00:13:11.863
and can reside in the Sahasrara.

00:13:11.994 --> 00:13:17.154
So first of all, one should see what sort of thoughts are coming.

00:13:17.187 --> 00:13:19.752
You have to condemn yourself sometimes.

00:13:19.834 --> 00:13:23.061
You have to say: “What nonsense! What have I been doing?

00:13:23.147 --> 00:13:27.299
What’s the matter with me? How could I do all that?”

00:13:27.371 --> 00:13:31.874
Once you start doing that, these thoughts will start disappearing.

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:34.654
These thoughts are coming from two angles,

00:13:34.754 --> 00:13:38.194
one from the ego and another from your conditionings.

00:13:38.306 --> 00:13:42.046
And these are so much built up within you,

00:13:42.139 --> 00:13:47.139
that they don’t allow your agnya to be crossed.

00:13:47.186 --> 00:13:51.590
That’s why we have two Bija mantras of ‘Hum’, ‘Kshum’.

00:13:51.634 --> 00:13:53.974
First one is, when it is conditioning,

00:13:54.074 --> 00:13:56.876
you are endowed with this kind of a fear,

00:13:56.994 --> 00:13:59.514
“I shouldn’t do like this, I shouldn’t do like that,

00:13:59.579 --> 00:14:02.779
it’s not allowed, that is not allowed.”

00:14:02.909 --> 00:14:04.965
That’s the conditioning part of it.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.195
Conditioning can be of many types.

00:14:07.274 --> 00:14:08.734
But the ego part of it is that,

00:14:08.834 --> 00:14:11.502
“I must overpower everybody, I must get this,

00:14:11.554 --> 00:14:15.971
I must be able to rule everyone.”

00:14:16.044 --> 00:14:19.715
These two things are there in the mind

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:23.477
which are all the time crossing over.

00:14:23.572 --> 00:14:29.016
So it’s important that we should go into thoughtless awareness

00:14:29.108 --> 00:14:34.135
and that thoughtless awareness is the real way

00:14:34.234 --> 00:14:39.554
that your Sahasrara can be nourished by the Kundalini.

00:14:39.704 --> 00:14:44.810
Because Kundalini cannot go through, it cannot pass through.

00:14:44.874 --> 00:14:48.739
And for that, as I said, there are two Bija mantras,

00:14:48.874 --> 00:14:51.016
one is ‘Hum’ another ’Kshum’.

00:14:51.114 --> 00:14:54.004
So, if you are conditioned, you are frightened,

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:57.568
you are afraid and you had ideas about yourself.

00:14:57.634 --> 00:15:00.426
These days the way people are describing, they’ll say,

00:15:00.492 --> 00:15:02.037
“I’m an extrovert”.

00:15:02.074 --> 00:15:04.029
Somebody will say, “I’m an introvert”,

00:15:04.131 --> 00:15:10.117
somebody will say “I’m a hippie”, “I’m that”, I’m that.

00:15:10.234 --> 00:15:13.774
All kinds of things they can have attributed to themselves.

00:15:13.874 --> 00:15:19.774
But these ideas are all coming from outside, they are not from inside.

00:15:19.874 --> 00:15:26.379
To get to the inner side of yourself, the subtler side of your being,

00:15:26.442 --> 00:15:30.783
you must allow the Kundalini to go through the Agnya.

00:15:30.874 --> 00:15:33.314
And to cross the Agnya is a very important thing

00:15:33.426 --> 00:15:37.234
in modern times and for that you have to meditate.

00:15:37.339 --> 00:15:41.855
If you can meditate with complete faith in yourself

00:15:41.944 --> 00:15:44.544
this Agnya can be opened out.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:47.190
With surrendering to the Divine,

00:15:47.243 --> 00:15:49.609
you have to surrender yourself to the Divine.

00:15:49.675 --> 00:15:53.601
And when this Agnya opens, you’ll be amazed,

00:15:53.651 --> 00:15:58.410
your Sahasrara is just waiting to transfer,

00:15:58.474 --> 00:16:05.314
to give you all the help that you need through the All-pervading Power.

00:16:05.554 --> 00:16:09.814
Your connection of Sahasrara with

00:16:09.818 --> 00:16:11.998
the All-pervading Power is established.

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:18.909
And by that you’ll be amazed how all these seven chakras work for you,

00:16:18.994 --> 00:16:24.054
how they help you, how they try to give you whatever

00:16:24.154 --> 00:16:27.774
is the real knowledge about everything.

00:16:27.874 --> 00:16:32.702
This real knowledge that you get is very joy giving.

00:16:32.789 --> 00:16:35.574
You can see this real knowledge in everything.

00:16:35.674 --> 00:16:39.374
You don’t have to start reading any book about it.

00:16:39.474 --> 00:16:44.794
In every situation and in every person, in every flower,

00:16:45.034 --> 00:16:52.615
in every natural happening, you see clearly the hand of the Divine.

00:16:52.674 --> 00:17:00.318
Once you see the hand of the Divine your egos start disappearing.

00:17:00.461 --> 00:17:05.659
Once you say that “It’s You. You do everything.”

00:17:05.747 --> 00:17:09.334
Kabira has said something great about this,

00:17:09.434 --> 00:17:18.314
he said that when the goat is alive it goes on saying

00:17:18.382 --> 00:17:21.910
“Mai, mai” - “I am, I am”.

00:17:22.034 --> 00:17:29.794
But when it is slaughtered and its intestines are made into strings,

00:17:29.835 --> 00:17:33.796
which are used for cleaning the cotton, then it said

00:17:33.827 --> 00:17:37.154
“tuhi, tuhi” - “you are, you are, you are”.

00:17:37.223 --> 00:17:41.185
See, in this symbolic way, they have suggested that:

00:17:41.272 --> 00:17:49.256
you have to become dissolved into this Divine power.

00:17:49.361 --> 00:17:52.321
“It’s the Divine power that does everything. What am I?

00:17:52.368 --> 00:17:57.514
I was just a drop and I fell into this ocean of awareness

00:17:57.617 --> 00:18:02.927
of the Divine power and that is taking over and working it out.”

00:18:03.058 --> 00:18:08.673
That will help you a lot to be a great Sahaja Yogi.

00:18:08.794 --> 00:18:14.146
You developed curing powers, but still you are not proud of it.

00:18:14.209 --> 00:18:18.440
You developed, of course, awakening powers, you are not proud of it.

00:18:18.594 --> 00:18:23.274
You develop so many creative powers and you are not proud of it.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:27.860
You become really very, very creative, extremely creative.

00:18:27.994 --> 00:18:29.970
But the greatest thing happend to you

00:18:30.034 --> 00:18:31.994
that you become a global personality.

00:18:32.092 --> 00:18:35.812
So you start seeing the problem of every country,

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:40.153
of every other nation where they have problems.

00:18:40.219 --> 00:18:44.271
But these problems, when you see, you don’t see like other people.

00:18:44.379 --> 00:18:47.486
Because others may like to use it for their own purpose,

00:18:47.594 --> 00:18:50.174
maybe for media, maybe for something.

00:18:50.274 --> 00:18:54.772
But what you want to see is that these problems are solved.

00:18:54.834 --> 00:19:00.542
You see, your powers are so great, with this kind of a mind,

00:19:00.714 --> 00:19:05.354
I would say, which is dominated completely by the Divine power,

00:19:05.442 --> 00:19:10.682
that it, whatever disturbs you,

00:19:10.835 --> 00:19:15.804
immediately it’s taken over and it starts working out.

00:19:15.834 --> 00:19:19.907
Many, many problems have been solved by Sahaja Yoga

00:19:20.034 --> 00:19:24.154
and also they can be solved on a very universal level,

00:19:24.276 --> 00:19:27.096
if you are a global person.

00:19:27.211 --> 00:19:29.020
If you are a global person then

00:19:29.114 --> 00:19:34.725
what happens is that you become a, sort of a, vehicle,

00:19:34.841 --> 00:19:39.141
or you can become like a channel for this Divine power

00:19:39.234 --> 00:19:43.797
to act because you are purely a global personality.

00:19:43.842 --> 00:19:46.074
Not attached to this, attached to that,

00:19:46.114 --> 00:19:50.174
but a pure Sahaja personality which can be used

00:19:50.281 --> 00:19:53.022
by this Divine power very easily.
