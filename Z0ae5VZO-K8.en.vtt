00:08.039 --> 00:11.452
So today is a day when you have to promise Me

00:11.554 --> 00:14.454
that you’ll meditate every night,

00:14.554 --> 00:17.514
every evening, maybe in the morning also.

00:17.628 --> 00:21.734
Whenever it is possible if you can go into a meditative mood,

00:21.834 --> 00:27.314
you are in contact with this Divine power.

00:27.634 --> 00:33.414
Then, whatever is good for you, whatever good for your society,

00:33.514 --> 00:39.135
for your country, all is done by this Divine power.

00:39.278 --> 00:42.714
You don’t have to overpower the Divine power,

00:42.994 --> 00:45.754
you don’t have to order, you don’t have to ask,

00:46.074 --> 00:53.334
just if you meditate you are one with this All-pervading Power

00:53.434 --> 00:58.434
which is another great blessing to us.

00:59.828 --> 01:03.970
Unless and until your Sahasrara is opened

01:04.074 --> 01:10.534
all the blessings of the Divine power cannot come to you, cannot.

01:10.634 --> 01:14.294
Maybe you might get some money, you might get some jobs,

01:14.394 --> 01:16.314
you might get this and that.

01:16.554 --> 01:20.534
But your own development is only possible when you meditate

01:20.634 --> 01:26.834
and your Sahasrara is completely open and open to truth.

01:27.114 --> 01:34.514
Now the truth is that this Divine power is compassion, is love.

01:34.874 --> 01:37.074
This is the truth.

01:37.078 --> 01:39.834
They say God is love and God is truth,

01:40.074 --> 01:45.394
so the equation has to be made that truth is love and love is truth.

01:45.507 --> 01:48.847
But it’s not a truth that, as you have for your own children,

01:49.074 --> 01:51.874
you have for your family, attached.

01:52.066 --> 01:55.066
Attached love is not truth.

01:55.434 --> 01:57.414
If you are attached to somebody

01:57.514 --> 02:01.334
then you never see the bad points of that person.

02:01.434 --> 02:03.454
If you are angry with somebody,

02:03.554 --> 02:06.774
then you can never see the good points of that person.

02:06.874 --> 02:11.014
But it’s a complete detached love

02:11.114 --> 02:14.434
and that love is extremely powerful

02:14.794 --> 02:19.214
because whenever you project that love to anyone,

02:19.314 --> 02:22.774
you’ll be surprised, the problems of that person will be solved,

02:22.874 --> 02:24.816
his personality will improve,

02:24.954 --> 02:29.994
everything will work out in a very big way and his life will be changed.

02:30.242 --> 02:34.998
But if you’re attached to anything whatsoever,

02:35.482 --> 02:46.650
that attachment itself causes problems and doesn’t allow Sahaj to grow.

02:46.811 --> 02:51.311
This attachment could be any kind, for example,

02:51.339 --> 02:55.503
you can be attached to your country, attached to your society,

02:55.554 --> 02:58.514
attached to your family, it can be of any kind.

02:58.635 --> 03:03.916
But when Sahasrara is open, you’ll learn one thing, is detachment.

03:03.996 --> 03:06.297
It just happens that you get detached.

03:06.434 --> 03:09.779
Though, I mean, you are not running away.

03:09.874 --> 03:14.067
As it is in Sahaja Yoga we don’t believe in people who run away

03:14.194 --> 03:19.145
from society and go to Himalayas, all that I call escapism,

03:19.216 --> 03:20.589
that is not the point.

03:20.629 --> 03:26.060
What happens is that you are there, you see everyone,

03:26.155 --> 03:30.033
you watch everyone, you know everyone,

03:30.095 --> 03:34.921
you are close to everyone, but you are a detached person.

03:35.074 --> 03:40.093
It’s a state of mind that you achieve when Sahasrara is open.

03:40.194 --> 03:44.936
In that state you are dealing with people,

03:45.074 --> 03:49.814
you are dealing with problems, you are dealing with situations,

03:49.914 --> 03:55.354
but you are not involved in it, there’s no involvement;

03:55.475 --> 03:58.630
and that involvement which you had before

03:58.754 --> 04:03.659
can never give a complete insight, what is happening,

04:03.691 --> 04:06.775
what the truth is, about any situation.

04:06.874 --> 04:09.756
So this detachment helps.

04:09.835 --> 04:15.801
The greatest thing of the detachment is that you are not affected.

04:15.914 --> 04:20.174
No use saying that, “oh you are not affected,

04:20.274 --> 04:26.175
Mother, so how can you feel for another person?

04:26.274 --> 04:30.580
How can you have compassion for another person?

04:30.618 --> 04:34.941
Because if you feel for another person

04:35.034 --> 04:38.154
then only you can solve the problem”.

04:38.187 --> 04:43.501
But this feeling that you have is again a kind of an attachment.

04:43.594 --> 04:50.209
It is not a real feeling, because it doesn’t help.

04:50.288 --> 04:52.714
The person is crying, you are also crying,

04:52.849 --> 04:55.494
the person is trouble, you are also in trouble.

04:55.594 --> 05:01.044
And this does not help that person, nor will it help you.

05:01.114 --> 05:05.014
So to have detached in no way means

05:05.114 --> 05:09.409
you do not feel for another person.

05:09.481 --> 05:10.854
You do feel.

05:10.954 --> 05:16.599
You feel the agony of that person, the trouble of that person,

05:16.734 --> 05:21.601
of the whole society sometimes and of the whole country.

05:21.714 --> 05:25.077
But that your feeling is so detached

05:25.154 --> 05:30.234
that the All-pervading Power takes over.

05:30.315 --> 05:32.541
First we must have full faith

05:32.594 --> 05:36.903
in the capability of this All-pervading Power.

05:36.963 --> 05:39.318
As soon as you are detached.

05:39.362 --> 05:43.142
You say, “You do it” - finished.

05:43.205 --> 05:45.650
Once you say that, “You are going to do it,

05:45.714 --> 05:47.834
it’s You who is going to do it,”

05:47.899 --> 05:50.057
whole thing changes completely.

05:50.154 --> 05:54.934
Because you transfer all your responsibilities, all your problems,

05:55.034 --> 05:58.374
to this Divine power, which is so powerful,

05:58.474 --> 06:03.600
which is so capable, which can work out anything.

06:03.655 --> 06:08.952
So whenever you think that this problem you are going to solve,

06:09.034 --> 06:11.440
you are the one who’s going to do it,

06:11.499 --> 06:17.167
then, alright, the Divine power says: “Alright, try your luck.”

06:17.234 --> 06:21.087
But if you can really put this problem to the Divine power,

06:21.158 --> 06:22.814
it will work out.

06:22.914 --> 06:26.034
We have all kinds of problems in Sahaja Yoga,

06:26.155 --> 06:29.708
especially when we find that people

06:29.772 --> 06:32.465
are not so much attracted to Sahaja Yoga,

06:32.554 --> 06:35.954
they are few in number then you feel very bad about it.

06:36.089 --> 06:39.325
But have you tried to meditate on this point,

06:39.394 --> 06:44.268
and have you tried to put this problem to the Divine power?

06:44.324 --> 06:46.054
Why should we worry?

06:46.066 --> 06:49.200
When we have Divine power available through our Sahasrara,

06:49.255 --> 06:50.374
why should we worry?

06:50.474 --> 06:52.614
Why should we think about it?

06:52.665 --> 06:56.118
Just leave it to the Divine power.

06:56.154 --> 07:00.354
If that is possible, if that you can achieve,

07:00.435 --> 07:03.234
which is very difficult for human beings,

07:03.356 --> 07:05.753
because they live with their ego,

07:05.793 --> 07:07.714
they live with their conditionings;

07:07.795 --> 07:12.858
but if that attachment to all these things goes away,

07:12.954 --> 07:18.274
then what you do is just leave things to this power.

07:18.860 --> 07:21.146
Krishna has said in His Gita:

07:21.234 --> 07:24.954
“Sarva dharmanam parityajya mamekam sharanam vraja”

07:25.059 --> 07:26.832
“Forget about all your dharmas”.

07:26.863 --> 07:31.674
Dharmas means, He means, meaning that we have a dharma of a wife,

07:31.827 --> 07:36.178
of a husband, of a member of the society,

07:36.274 --> 07:38.519
all of them have their own dharma.

07:38.594 --> 07:44.037
But He says “Leave them. And leave it, them to Me and I’ll manage.”

07:44.154 --> 07:47.607
This is it what we have to learn, is to say that

07:47.674 --> 07:52.160
“It’s this Divine power which will solve our problems.”

07:52.308 --> 07:55.628
As human beings it’s a very difficult state

07:55.755 --> 07:59.895
and this state only can be achieved through meditation.

07:59.954 --> 08:03.734
But I’m not saying that you go on meditating for hours together.

08:03.781 --> 08:05.233
That’s not necessary.

08:05.274 --> 08:10.934
But with full faith in yourself and in the Divine power.

08:11.034 --> 08:14.294
If you work it out, I’m sure it’s not difficult

08:14.394 --> 08:18.594
to rise to that state of consciousness.

08:18.690 --> 08:21.904
That is what we have to achieve.

08:21.952 --> 08:25.396
It’s possible for men as well as for women.

08:25.476 --> 08:29.232
They don’t have to think: “How can we, Mother, do it after all?”

08:29.354 --> 08:32.594
You see, all such people are no good for Sahaja Yoga.

08:32.707 --> 08:38.668
Those who have diffidence about themselves cannot do anything.

08:38.747 --> 08:43.327
But those who are surrendered and those who think they can do it,

08:43.474 --> 08:53.156
can manage all this transfer of their power to the Divine power.

08:53.274 --> 08:55.054
Just put it on the Divine power.

08:55.154 --> 09:00.022
Now supposing I have a car which can drive Me down.

09:00.089 --> 09:04.585
So, if I have a car then I don’t put bullocks on it,

09:04.714 --> 09:10.574
that I don’t push My car, I just sit inside and use it.

09:10.674 --> 09:15.050
In the same way, if you have this great power around you,

09:15.154 --> 09:20.383
if your Sahasrara is absolutely, completely submerged in it,

09:20.514 --> 09:26.883
then you’ll be amazed how things work out for yourself.

09:27.763 --> 09:32.074
I will give you an example of a Sahaja Yogi, he’s no more now,

09:32.154 --> 09:36.594
he was a fisherman, ordinary fisherman, but also he was educated,

09:36.635 --> 09:39.992
so he was working in a bank.

09:40.071 --> 09:43.914
This one was going one day to do some Sahaja Yoga work

09:44.010 --> 09:46.338
and he had to go by boat.

09:46.429 --> 09:50.084
So when he came out he saw that the whole place was clouded

09:50.194 --> 09:53.814
and it was about to burst out into a big havoc.

09:53.914 --> 10:00.831
So he got very much perturbed about it that – “what is this?”

10:00.907 --> 10:05.589
Immediately, his Sahasrara was so open and good, immediately he said,

10:05.703 --> 10:08.834
“Now I leave it to this Divine power

10:08.890 --> 10:12.169
to stop all these things happening.

10:12.274 --> 10:15.669
I don’t want it to rain and to have any problem

10:15.754 --> 10:19.336
till I come back home and go off to sleep”.

10:19.394 --> 10:22.854
And it was surprising, people told Me that

10:22.954 --> 10:26.306
“Mother, the clouds and everything were there

10:26.372 --> 10:32.456
all throughout but it did not rain, did not do anything,

10:32.594 --> 10:35.861
and there was no chaos of any kind”.

10:35.914 --> 10:38.885
He went to another island where he had to go,

10:38.964 --> 10:41.456
he did Sahaja Yoga and came back.

10:41.528 --> 10:44.258
And then when he went to sleep, then only,

10:44.354 --> 10:46.514
everything started pouring down.

10:46.603 --> 10:51.660
So, nature, everything, every leaf, every flower, everything,

10:51.764 --> 10:54.938
is worked out through the Divine power.

10:55.034 --> 10:59.074
So we should not have our ego that we can do something ourselves,

10:59.163 --> 11:00.899
we can manage ourselves.

11:00.954 --> 11:02.910
Once you have that kind of a thing,

11:02.974 --> 11:04.934
you are not yet that much developed,

11:05.034 --> 11:08.664
you are not that much grown up in Sahaja Yoga.

11:08.752 --> 11:12.734
But to grow up in Sahaja Yoga should not be difficult for you,

11:12.834 --> 11:15.633
because you have guidelines.

11:15.696 --> 11:20.268
Those people who got their realization, very few of them,

11:20.314 --> 11:24.514
like Sufis and we had some saints in India, all of them;

11:24.604 --> 11:26.382
how much they must have struggled.

11:26.469 --> 11:29.217
Nobody to guide them, nobody to help them,

11:29.274 --> 11:32.594
nobody to tell them about what they can achieve.

11:32.669 --> 11:37.670
And despite that they were very satisfied people,

11:37.772 --> 11:41.353
very happy people, and they worked it out so well.

11:41.467 --> 11:46.964
They saw the whole world with another angle, as you can also see,

11:47.028 --> 11:50.821
but they were not upset and they had such self-confidence,

11:50.930 --> 11:56.937
they had such knowledge of their own

11:57.120 --> 12:01.175
that they achieved through their meditative process.

12:01.274 --> 12:02.934
And the way they have written books,

12:03.034 --> 12:06.286
some of them are so great, it’s very surprisingly,

12:06.321 --> 12:14.558
how they have achieved these great verses, such full of knowledge.

12:14.627 --> 12:19.360
One cannot understand that they had no guidance,

12:19.434 --> 12:22.463
nobody was to tell them.

12:22.558 --> 12:24.883
But one thing with them was

12:24.954 --> 12:30.748
that they always tried to look after their Sahasrara.

12:30.834 --> 12:34.367
Now one thing is there obstructing Sahasrara

12:34.443 --> 12:40.360
is the movement of your Agnya into thoughts.

12:40.434 --> 12:44.334
That’s the only thing, that’s the only thing

12:44.434 --> 12:47.544
that stops your entry into Sahaja Yoga.

12:47.694 --> 12:51.885
Thoughts are coming all the time,

12:51.954 --> 12:56.274
because a human being is born who reacts to everything,

12:56.324 --> 12:58.188
react to this and react to that

12:58.236 --> 13:01.334
and the thoughts come in and the thoughts go.

13:01.378 --> 13:03.379
There’s a big crowd of thoughts.

13:03.434 --> 13:07.434
Because of that your attention cannot cross over Agnya

13:07.514 --> 13:11.863
and can reside in the Sahasrara.

13:11.994 --> 13:17.154
So first of all, one should see what sort of thoughts are coming.

13:17.187 --> 13:19.752
You have to condemn yourself sometimes.

13:19.834 --> 13:23.061
You have to say: “What nonsense! What have I been doing?

13:23.147 --> 13:27.299
What’s the matter with me? How could I do all that?”

13:27.371 --> 13:31.874
Once you start doing that, these thoughts will start disappearing.

13:31.990 --> 13:34.654
These thoughts are coming from two angles,

13:34.754 --> 13:38.194
one from the ego and another from your conditionings.

13:38.306 --> 13:42.046
And these are so much built up within you,

13:42.139 --> 13:47.139
that they don’t allow your agnya to be crossed.

13:47.186 --> 13:51.590
That’s why we have two Bija mantras of ‘Hum’, ‘Kshum’.

13:51.634 --> 13:53.974
First one is, when it is conditioning,

13:54.074 --> 13:56.876
you are endowed with this kind of a fear,

13:56.994 --> 13:59.514
“I shouldn’t do like this, I shouldn’t do like that,

13:59.579 --> 14:02.779
it’s not allowed, that is not allowed.”

14:02.909 --> 14:04.965
That’s the conditioning part of it.

14:05.020 --> 14:07.195
Conditioning can be of many types.

14:07.274 --> 14:08.734
But the ego part of it is that,

14:08.834 --> 14:11.502
“I must overpower everybody, I must get this,

14:11.554 --> 14:15.971
I must be able to rule everyone.”

14:16.044 --> 14:19.715
These two things are there in the mind

14:19.780 --> 14:23.477
which are all the time crossing over.

14:23.572 --> 14:29.016
So it’s important that we should go into thoughtless awareness

14:29.108 --> 14:34.135
and that thoughtless awareness is the real way

14:34.234 --> 14:39.554
that your Sahasrara can be nourished by the Kundalini.

14:39.704 --> 14:44.810
Because Kundalini cannot go through, it cannot pass through.

14:44.874 --> 14:48.739
And for that, as I said, there are two Bija mantras,

14:48.874 --> 14:51.016
one is ‘Hum’ another ’Kshum’.

14:51.114 --> 14:54.004
So, if you are conditioned, you are frightened,

14:54.050 --> 14:57.568
you are afraid and you had ideas about yourself.

14:57.634 --> 15:00.426
These days the way people are describing, they’ll say,

15:00.492 --> 15:02.037
“I’m an extrovert”.

15:02.074 --> 15:04.029
Somebody will say, “I’m an introvert”,

15:04.131 --> 15:10.117
somebody will say “I’m a hippie”, “I’m that”, I’m that.

15:10.234 --> 15:13.774
All kinds of things they can have attributed to themselves.

15:13.874 --> 15:19.774
But these ideas are all coming from outside, they are not from inside.

15:19.874 --> 15:26.379
To get to the inner side of yourself, the subtler side of your being,

15:26.442 --> 15:30.783
you must allow the Kundalini to go through the Agnya.

15:30.874 --> 15:33.314
And to cross the Agnya is a very important thing

15:33.426 --> 15:37.234
in modern times and for that you have to meditate.

15:37.339 --> 15:41.855
If you can meditate with complete faith in yourself

15:41.944 --> 15:44.544
this Agnya can be opened out.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.190
With surrendering to the Divine,

15:47.243 --> 15:49.609
you have to surrender yourself to the Divine.

15:49.675 --> 15:53.601
And when this Agnya opens, you’ll be amazed,

15:53.651 --> 15:58.410
your Sahasrara is just waiting to transfer,

15:58.474 --> 16:05.314
to give you all the help that you need through the All-pervading Power.

16:05.554 --> 16:09.814
Your connection of Sahasrara with

16:09.818 --> 16:11.998
the All-pervading Power is established.

16:12.090 --> 16:18.909
And by that you’ll be amazed how all these seven chakras work for you,

16:18.994 --> 16:24.054
how they help you, how they try to give you whatever

16:24.154 --> 16:27.774
is the real knowledge about everything.

16:27.874 --> 16:32.702
This real knowledge that you get is very joy giving.

16:32.789 --> 16:35.574
You can see this real knowledge in everything.

16:35.674 --> 16:39.374
You don’t have to start reading any book about it.

16:39.474 --> 16:44.794
In every situation and in every person, in every flower,

16:45.034 --> 16:52.615
in every natural happening, you see clearly the hand of the Divine.

16:52.674 --> 17:00.318
Once you see the hand of the Divine your egos start disappearing.

17:00.461 --> 17:05.659
Once you say that “It’s You. You do everything.”

17:05.747 --> 17:09.334
Kabira has said something great about this,

17:09.434 --> 17:18.314
he said that when the goat is alive it goes on saying

17:18.382 --> 17:21.910
“Mai, mai” - “I am, I am”.

17:22.034 --> 17:29.794
But when it is slaughtered and its intestines are made into strings,

17:29.835 --> 17:33.796
which are used for cleaning the cotton, then it said

17:33.827 --> 17:37.154
“tuhi, tuhi” - “you are, you are, you are”.

17:37.223 --> 17:41.185
See, in this symbolic way, they have suggested that:

17:41.272 --> 17:49.256
you have to become dissolved into this Divine power.

17:49.361 --> 17:52.321
“It’s the Divine power that does everything. What am I?

17:52.368 --> 17:57.514
I was just a drop and I fell into this ocean of awareness

17:57.617 --> 18:02.927
of the Divine power and that is taking over and working it out.”

18:03.058 --> 18:08.673
That will help you a lot to be a great Sahaja Yogi.

18:08.794 --> 18:14.146
You developed curing powers, but still you are not proud of it.

18:14.209 --> 18:18.440
You developed, of course, awakening powers, you are not proud of it.

18:18.594 --> 18:23.274
You develop so many creative powers and you are not proud of it.

18:23.340 --> 18:27.860
You become really very, very creative, extremely creative.

18:27.994 --> 18:29.970
But the greatest thing happend to you

18:30.034 --> 18:31.994
that you become a global personality.

18:32.092 --> 18:35.812
So you start seeing the problem of every country,

18:35.940 --> 18:40.153
of every other nation where they have problems.

18:40.219 --> 18:44.271
But these problems, when you see, you don’t see like other people.

18:44.379 --> 18:47.486
Because others may like to use it for their own purpose,

18:47.594 --> 18:50.174
maybe for media, maybe for something.

18:50.274 --> 18:54.772
But what you want to see is that these problems are solved.

18:54.834 --> 19:00.542
You see, your powers are so great, with this kind of a mind,

19:00.714 --> 19:05.354
I would say, which is dominated completely by the Divine power,

19:05.442 --> 19:10.682
that it, whatever disturbs you,

19:10.835 --> 19:15.804
immediately it’s taken over and it starts working out.

19:15.834 --> 19:19.907
Many, many problems have been solved by Sahaja Yoga

19:20.034 --> 19:24.154
and also they can be solved on a very universal level,

19:24.276 --> 19:27.096
if you are a global person.

19:27.211 --> 19:29.020
If you are a global person then

19:29.114 --> 19:34.725
what happens is that you become a, sort of a, vehicle,

19:34.841 --> 19:39.141
or you can become like a channel for this Divine power

19:39.234 --> 19:43.797
to act because you are purely a global personality.

19:43.842 --> 19:46.074
Not attached to this, attached to that,

19:46.114 --> 19:50.174
but a pure Sahaja personality which can be used

19:50.281 --> 19:53.022
by this Divine power very easily.
