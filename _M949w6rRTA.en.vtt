01:10:19.746 --> 01:10:35.471
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

01:10:35.654 --> 01:10:49.474
These days there are people who are going
all over the places to find out the Truth,

01:10:49.474 --> 01:11:02.614
the enlightenment. And there are so many books
available, so many people who talk about enlightenment.

01:11:02.614 --> 01:11:13.493
And this is only in this special age, which
I call as " the blossom time ", is happening.

01:11:13.493 --> 01:11:21.753
If they are not seeking the Truth, that means
they are not yet evolved as this should have

01:11:21.753 --> 01:11:33.104
been. But this is a special time that we call
as the "Last Judgement" and that time has

01:11:33.104 --> 01:11:42.563
come. In the Koran it's called as Kiyama and
described very clearly what will happen at

01:11:42.563 --> 01:11:57.034
this time. All these have been indicated in
all the books which are, I would say, mystical

01:11:57.034 --> 01:12:05.724
or we can call as religious - whatever you
may call it - the mystic part of it. They've

01:12:05.724 --> 01:12:17.144
all indicated this time, this time by the
end of this century, this should happen. And

01:12:17.144 --> 01:12:30.344
this has bewildered many people, they are
going hither and thither, getting into problems.

01:12:30.344 --> 01:12:49.114
As it's very embarrassing what Dr. Derek Lee
has told Me. Is a fact that I went to Russia

01:12:49.114 --> 01:12:56.854
and a scientist came forward and he said that:
" Mother, I have seen your photographs and

01:12:56.854 --> 01:13:05.334
it says so much because I haven't seen more
than one line showing. " It is very embarassing,

01:13:05.334 --> 01:13:13.094
the whole thing was very embarrassing for
Me. And he said: " I've proved it now, through

01:13:13.094 --> 01:13:19.423
all equations and everything. " And he showed
Me the book which is in Russian language and

01:13:19.423 --> 01:13:28.404
all mathematical calculations, that one has
to go to a vacuum state, a physical vacuum

01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:39.193
state, for Reality to be understood. It was,
I think, too much of science in it.

01:13:39.193 --> 01:13:49.534
For whatever it is, all these ideas, say of
Koran, of Bible, of other religious books,

01:13:49.534 --> 01:13:57.324
all the religious books from India could be
called as a myth and they were treated as

01:13:57.324 --> 01:14:02.803
myths. Many people thought it was just a myth
and they said there's no use believing in

01:14:02.803 --> 01:14:09.894
all these things, there is nothing. And also
through these books, people have been misled

01:14:09.894 --> 01:14:16.414
to do wrong things, so the whole thing got
challenged also in a way: that it's not practical,

01:14:16.414 --> 01:14:22.494
it's not beneficial, is no good.

01:14:22.494 --> 01:14:29.584
But when it becomes a real experience - you
may call it subjective, may call it anything

01:14:29.584 --> 01:14:41.594
- but when it becomes a real experience, then
you start believing in it as Reality. But

01:14:41.594 --> 01:14:51.094
if a scientist proves it with his scientific
knowledge, then I don't know what to say,

01:14:51.094 --> 01:15:03.704
then it really becomes the fact. And when
it becomes the fact it becomes the science.

01:15:03.704 --> 01:15:11.553
Science can be challenged. First of all, science
is amoral. It is not bothered, as a science

01:15:11.553 --> 01:15:19.033
as it exists today, if they create atom-bombs,
they create other things destructive and use

01:15:19.033 --> 01:15:25.464
it for wrong purposes, there is no binding
force on the scientist. They can do whatever

01:15:25.464 --> 01:15:36.533
they like and people can use it the way they
want to use it. But when it comes to Divine

01:15:36.533 --> 01:15:45.894
force, the science is perfect, I must tell
you. You cannot challenge that science, you

01:15:45.894 --> 01:15:59.074
cannot - everything that you know through
the science of Sahaja Yoga, you can easily

01:15:59.074 --> 01:16:01.433
verify it.

01:16:01.433 --> 01:16:12.514
For example, firstly it is said that your
physical elements disappear, it's a fact.

01:16:12.514 --> 01:16:25.293
Without any money, without any fees or anything,
just you get cured of your troubles. And when

01:16:25.293 --> 01:16:32.913
you get cured of your troubles, then you are
amazed how through your own power you have

01:16:32.913 --> 01:16:40.874
been cured. But it happens, it has happened
- you know, we have many doctors here - English

01:16:40.874 --> 01:16:51.114
doctors, not easy to convince - and they have
seen with their own experience that many patients

01:16:51.114 --> 01:17:02.563
who were supposed to be incurable are cured.
They have seen that many drug addicts got

01:17:02.563 --> 01:17:12.594
all right overnight. How? Without paying for
it, without taking any medicine, just through

01:17:12.594 --> 01:17:16.094
their own power of Kundalini.

01:17:16.094 --> 01:17:25.264
Now this power of Kundalini was known all
over the world, I think, because I find in

01:17:25.264 --> 01:17:34.514
their museums Kundalini drawn in the triangular
bone even in Sweden I saw. But I should say,

01:17:34.514 --> 01:17:44.274
it's in Finland, I saw. Then also, I went
to Ukraine in their museum, there are all

01:17:44.274 --> 01:17:55.074
pictures of these chakras and of the Kundalini.
And in a farfetched place like Bolivia, where

01:17:55.074 --> 01:18:04.614
it could not reach there even by air about,
I think, six years back, you find the pictures

01:18:04.614 --> 01:18:16.533
of Kundalini. And Colombia, the ancient Colombia
had created statues in which Kundalini was

01:18:16.533 --> 01:18:24.574
the main thing. So somebody must have told
them or they might have known about Her. But

01:18:24.574 --> 01:18:31.094
somebody went from Italy to Bolivia and the
Bolivian people said " We know all about it,

01:18:31.094 --> 01:18:36.263
yes, we know. But we don't know how to raise
the Kundalini. " And now there are I think

01:18:36.263 --> 01:18:42.364
eight, nine thousand people in that farfetched
place of Bolivia who have got their Realization.

01:18:42.364 --> 01:18:48.444
For which you don't have to pay. Is the main
thing one should understand. It's like you

01:18:48.444 --> 01:18:55.794
don't pay for your breathing, you don't pay
for your digestion - in the same way for your

01:18:55.794 --> 01:19:05.864
ascent to a new life, last, we can say, the
breakthrough of your evolution, for which

01:19:05.864 --> 01:19:15.854
you don't have to pay. As soon as you understand
this point, you'll be amazed that you'll give

01:19:15.854 --> 01:19:23.523
up all nonsensical people who are marketing
their things, selling their things. You see,

01:19:23.523 --> 01:19:34.324
it's something absurd, the absurdity to such
a limit that you become blind and you don't

01:19:34.324 --> 01:19:39.694
know what they are doing, what they're up
to. And don't want to listen to anybody who

01:19:39.694 --> 01:19:44.934
wants to tell you the truth.

01:19:44.934 --> 01:19:55.574
Now if we have to see for our own ascent - as
they say in Koran, Miraj - in India this thing

01:19:55.574 --> 01:20:06.753
is called as Self-realization, Atma Darshan,
or you can call it, Atma Sakshatkar. If you

01:20:06.753 --> 01:20:15.704
really want it - it's very easy and has to
be easy, because it is so vital. And when

01:20:15.704 --> 01:20:23.454
that works out, you actually experience it
and it can be tallied with the description

01:20:23.454 --> 01:20:33.444
of it. The trouble is we are so mental. We
want to derive everything on a mental level.

01:20:33.444 --> 01:20:38.864
But thank God, this scientist has found out
something for your mind to go round and round

01:20:38.864 --> 01:20:44.374
and round and reach the point. Because I think
sometimes this mind, which is filled with

01:20:44.374 --> 01:20:54.134
all kinds of false ideas - sometimes slightly
right ideas or sometimes real ideas - they

01:20:54.134 --> 01:20:59.924
go on bombarding in your head. And this scientist
has said that you have to go to the vacuum,

01:20:59.924 --> 01:21:11.144
which Jung has described as thoughtless awareness,
to become thoughtless. When you become thoughtless,

01:21:11.144 --> 01:21:15.884
then you can see, feel Reality.

01:21:15.884 --> 01:21:25.414
So, what happens, how do we get thought? When
we go to some place, we see something - immediately

01:21:25.414 --> 01:21:32.644
we react, that's our habit. This can be also
proved scientifically why we always react.

01:21:32.644 --> 01:21:42.444
Either we react towards it or we absorb it.
So, all the time our mind is working - and

01:21:42.444 --> 01:21:49.714
it is a wobbly mind. You are all the time
bothered with it and the modern times are

01:21:49.714 --> 01:21:55.054
the worst, though this is a special time,
as I said, because this is the time when people

01:21:55.054 --> 01:22:01.894
think the most and this thinking goes on acting
in such a way that they suffer from all kinds

01:22:01.894 --> 01:22:09.694
of diseases. Also sometimes this mind doesn't
tell you that this is wrong, that is wrong.

01:22:09.694 --> 01:22:16.554
You go on doing things you know, for example,
Hitler, how he behaved, how he killed so many

01:22:16.554 --> 01:22:23.194
people, but he never realized he was doing
something wrong, never. Ultimately, he killed

01:22:23.194 --> 01:22:28.554
himself because he was afraid that he'll be
caught, but not that he repented. So, they

01:22:28.554 --> 01:22:34.273
go on doing wrong things all the time without
knowing that they are doing wrong things.

01:22:34.273 --> 01:22:41.404
Now, to say this is sin, that is sin only
fills people with fear, that's all and guilt.

01:22:41.404 --> 01:22:49.163
But actually when you become the Self, in
the light of the Self, you know what is right

01:22:49.163 --> 01:22:58.354
and what is wrong, what should be avoided,
what is not beneficial for you. You just know,

01:22:58.354 --> 01:23:05.624
because you know about your Self, you get
the Self knowledge that is you can feel your

01:23:05.624 --> 01:23:11.994
centres - has been told to you - on your finger
tips, this again is said in the Koran that

01:23:11.994 --> 01:23:18.474
" at the time of Kiyama - the Last Judgement
- your hands will speak ". But whole thing

01:23:18.474 --> 01:23:26.163
gets perverted sometimes by using it for a
wrong purpose, that's how we have destroyed

01:23:26.163 --> 01:23:35.033
sometimes the real knowledge, the subtle knowledge
of our being. It's nothing to stand for hours

01:23:35.033 --> 01:23:41.444
together on one leg in Himalayas torturing
your body. You don't have to torture your

01:23:41.444 --> 01:23:48.844
body at all. People think that if you have
to perfect yourself, you must torture. This

01:23:48.844 --> 01:23:56.654
body is the temple. What is the use of building
temples after temples when you cannot build

01:23:56.654 --> 01:24:04.134
your own temple? This body is the temple and
why should you torture this body? You must

01:24:04.134 --> 01:24:12.674
look after this body, look after with love,
with respect and then only you will realize

01:24:12.674 --> 01:24:22.654
how important is to have a body. All these
funny ideas, you know, of renunciation and

01:24:22.654 --> 01:24:30.314
all false kind of approach is not going to
help.

01:24:30.314 --> 01:24:36.273
My daughter was coming from India. She said,
there were some fair people travelling with

01:24:36.273 --> 01:24:43.473
us in first class. So, they wouldn't allow
the air hostess to come and serve them, because

01:24:43.473 --> 01:24:50.674
they cannot allow the air hostess to talk
to them. So I said " Did you talk to them?

01:24:50.674 --> 01:24:54.973
" Said "How could I, I'm a woman, who would
talk to me?" Because she's a woman, nobody

01:24:54.973 --> 01:25:02.054
would talk. Then, sat on the ground. There's
no ground but they wouldn't sit on the chair

01:25:02.054 --> 01:25:09.723
and eat the food. For what? Because they are
renouncing everything, I think they have renounced

01:25:09.723 --> 01:25:15.704
their brains, that's what it is.

01:25:15.704 --> 01:25:24.163
All kinds of stupid things people do, for
what? To achieve that state of tranquility,

01:25:24.163 --> 01:25:31.714
the state of Self realization, of Self knowledge.
But just think of it, which is what has to

01:25:31.714 --> 01:25:40.743
happen inside. What's the use of doing something
outside unnecessarily making a mess of yourself

01:25:40.743 --> 01:25:52.654
and of others? It is absurd, the way people
try to understand that by troubling your body,

01:25:52.654 --> 01:26:00.614
by making a mess of your body, making a mess
of the whole society that you can achieve

01:26:00.614 --> 01:26:07.824
something which is so subtle and beautiful.

01:26:07.824 --> 01:26:19.904
Now, the scientists call this All Pervading
Power, or which I say, of Divine love, as

01:26:19.904 --> 01:26:29.214
cosmic energy, or they may call it by any
name. But it's nothing solid, it is Love,

01:26:29.214 --> 01:26:40.594
it is love of God. And this Divine love of
God is an energy that runs the whole universe,

01:26:40.594 --> 01:26:52.394
universes of universes. Just see the miracle
of life. All that is managed by this energy

01:26:52.394 --> 01:27:02.084
of Divine love! Well, we have never felt it
before, so we don't know what it is, but in

01:27:02.084 --> 01:27:08.064
every scripture it's written there - that
there is the power of Divine love. For example,

01:27:08.064 --> 01:27:17.533
in Sanskrit, this is called Parama Chaitanya
or Brahma Chaitanya. In every scripture it

01:27:17.533 --> 01:27:23.544
is being described, but for people it's some
sort of a... unknown thing.

01:27:23.544 --> 01:27:34.154
But now, with science, if it can be proved
that the whole universe is managed by this

01:27:34.154 --> 01:27:44.794
energy which thinks, which understands, which
loves. For example, the same scientist came

01:27:44.794 --> 01:27:51.384
to see Me, to have an interview with Me. He
was smiling all the time and he asked Me very

01:27:51.384 --> 01:27:58.983
interesting questions. One of them he asked
about the picture he had seen. Where? Here

01:27:58.983 --> 01:28:06.394
in this hall. They were singing the song " Sitting
in the heart of the Universe " and all over

01:28:06.394 --> 01:28:11.884
Me came: heart, heart, heart, heart, just
like a doctor would draw the line of the heart

01:28:11.884 --> 01:28:22.783
- so many hearts drawn with the rays of light.
And he asked " What is this, Mother? How do

01:28:22.783 --> 01:28:29.714
they know that they are singing this song?
" I said " Because I know, so they also know.

01:28:29.714 --> 01:28:38.993
" Precisely how do they do things? Because
they know, they know more than anyone can

01:28:38.993 --> 01:28:47.924
know. Not only that but the way our genes
and all those things are there is a very subtle

01:28:47.924 --> 01:28:56.783
thing, no doubt, but is all managed by this
power of Divine love. Please understand: there

01:28:56.783 --> 01:29:08.223
is nothing to fear, nothing to get upset,
nothing to starve, nothing to climb Himalayas,

01:29:08.223 --> 01:29:17.544
nothing needed. This power loves you and it
is around you, here it is. It is everywhere

01:29:17.544 --> 01:29:23.874
and it pulsates, it vibrates, it creates everything.

01:29:23.874 --> 01:29:30.054
Also the scientist told Me about Einstein,
who said that " All these ideas come to me

01:29:30.054 --> 01:29:36.304
not from within but from without as if somebody
is pouring these ideas into me. " And he said

01:29:36.304 --> 01:29:44.723
" I felt the same way and so many scientists
feel that. " Surprisingly, in Russia the scientists

01:29:44.723 --> 01:29:51.753
are very open hearted. And at the time of
Stalin, they were all arrested and put in

01:29:51.753 --> 01:29:56.834
a place called Novosibirsk (?), where they
were living, and there they developed, you

01:29:56.834 --> 01:30:02.943
see, this subtler side - because they were
not allowed very much to do other things.

01:30:02.943 --> 01:30:09.054
So they developed the subtler side of human
beings, and there they found out also about

01:30:09.054 --> 01:30:16.263
auras - he is one of them - auras: that human
beings have auras and from the auras, you

01:30:16.263 --> 01:30:23.713
can diagnose their diseases. But now, after
seeing My photographs and all that he has

01:30:23.713 --> 01:30:29.443
reached the proper conclusion surprisingly.
And I think, I hope I'll be saved from all

01:30:29.443 --> 01:30:36.713
kinds of people who criticize Sahaja Yoga
as a cult or this and that. It is not. It's

01:30:36.713 --> 01:30:40.404
a living process whether you are a hindu,
muslim, christian, anything, is meant for

01:30:40.404 --> 01:30:53.733
you and it is your right, your birth right
to have it. And then after that, once you

01:30:53.733 --> 01:31:00.894
get the sprouting of the seed, you must allow
this tree to grow. Actually, those people

01:31:00.894 --> 01:31:07.914
who talk of social work, talk of helping others,
doing this for them and doing that for them

01:31:07.914 --> 01:31:15.864
have to understand: first you should be empowered,
you must have the power within yourself to

01:31:15.864 --> 01:31:21.354
help others. But if you just come to My program,
they always say " Mother, for Your program

01:31:21.354 --> 01:31:27.753
the whole hall is full. " and then they start
disappearing - specially in England, very

01:31:27.753 --> 01:31:34.683
surprising. England is the heart of the universe,
and how could they be so careless about their

01:31:34.683 --> 01:31:43.614
ascent and so careless about developing their
own huge big tree of love. They are the best

01:31:43.614 --> 01:31:53.253
suited and they have to work it out. But they
don't, they don't take it seriously. Why,

01:31:53.253 --> 01:32:04.654
I don't understand. Maybe they don't know
what they are. They are very powerful people,

01:32:04.654 --> 01:32:14.294
they are, I should say, the instrument of
the Divine. Only thing, they have to develop.

01:32:14.294 --> 01:32:23.203
But they stick on to this or stick on to that
- then you can't grow. This is a seed already

01:32:23.203 --> 01:32:31.374
placed within you - undisturbed, unspoiled.
Only thing is a little water of love has to

01:32:31.374 --> 01:32:41.664
be poured on it, then the seed sprouts, and
when the seed sprouts, it rises, the plumule

01:32:41.664 --> 01:32:50.263
sprouts out into and it rises, goes up and
comes out of your fontanel bone area, which

01:32:50.263 --> 01:33:01.564
is called as Brahmarandra in Sanskrit language,
meaning the hole to feel the Brahma, the All-pervading

01:33:01.564 --> 01:33:02.533
power.

01:33:02.533 --> 01:33:10.174
I've seen people who know also Sanskrit very
well. They are running here organizations,

01:33:10.174 --> 01:33:16.834
but they don't know anything about Kundalini,
it's very surprising. What do they read, I

01:33:16.834 --> 01:33:21.453
don't know. And if you go to them, they'll
argue so much with you that you feel like

01:33:21.453 --> 01:33:28.243
running away from them. Only they know how
to argue. No argument needed actually, it

01:33:28.243 --> 01:33:34.824
is there, within you, this power is. Do you
argue with your stomach how to digest the

01:33:34.824 --> 01:33:42.203
food? And even if you do, will the stomach
understand? It's as stupid as that, to argue

01:33:42.203 --> 01:33:49.314
about something which is so spontaneous, which
is a living process - it's a living process

01:33:49.314 --> 01:33:57.854
of your evolution. Now, by the way, how did
we become human beings? Do we know? And how

01:33:57.854 --> 01:34:04.493
do we become a super human being? If there
is a way, there's a method, you don't have

01:34:04.493 --> 01:34:11.834
to spend anything. But you have to grow. If
you don't grow, it's useless, as Christ has

01:34:11.834 --> 01:34:23.384
described, just as some seeds fell onto the
land which was not fertile. Is it so? Are

01:34:23.384 --> 01:34:30.503
we living in a land which is not fertile for
spirituality or we are running after some

01:34:30.503 --> 01:34:39.394
things which are illusive? Why should we run
after illusive things? Here, you get the experience,

01:34:39.394 --> 01:34:49.414
all right, after that you must grow. If you
grow, you can change this world - it's a global

01:34:49.414 --> 01:34:56.384
movement. Like in Russia, I would say, there
are millions, millions in Russia. While in

01:34:56.384 --> 01:35:07.624
India, too, we have may be millions. And also
Austria - so many countries have got it - Italy,

01:35:07.624 --> 01:35:16.554
imagine. Their people have awakened, so why
not in England? And the leaders of England

01:35:16.554 --> 01:35:25.763
are rather upset with the English. They think
this... " It doesn't work out, Mother. " I

01:35:25.763 --> 01:35:32.844
can't understand. Because this is the seventh
time I'm here, and seventh heavens you have

01:35:32.844 --> 01:35:41.804
to know, that you can know without any difficulties,
without paying anything, the whole knowledge

01:35:41.804 --> 01:35:51.634
is free! Is it because it is free you don't
care? They've asked Me to talk about it. Otherwise

01:35:51.634 --> 01:36:00.273
it's not worth talking about these things.
Your country as such is like really the heart

01:36:00.273 --> 01:36:08.614
and it circulates all over the world. All
your newspapers - they may be useless - but

01:36:08.614 --> 01:36:15.463
they circulate. All your media - whatever
they may publish - it circulates all over

01:36:15.463 --> 01:36:21.114
the world. You don't know about Americans,
though it's supposed to be a very great country.

01:36:21.114 --> 01:36:29.354
We don't know about any other country so much
as we know about England. How? Why? Monarchy

01:36:29.354 --> 01:36:35.963
in so many places, but we know everything
about monarchy from England. Why? How? How

01:36:35.963 --> 01:36:44.644
do we manage? Is worth asking this question:
there's something special about this country.

01:36:44.644 --> 01:36:52.334
I lived here for years, I've worked hard,
I went from North to South, East to West.

01:36:52.334 --> 01:37:00.203
Perhaps, I left no city which I did not visit.
But the situation is such that when they get

01:37:00.203 --> 01:37:04.524
Realization, they are very happy, they start
jumping, and after that they forget about

01:37:04.524 --> 01:37:17.614
it. It's a great responsibility on people
of UK that they can do so much in spirituality.

01:37:17.614 --> 01:37:30.433
Not...it's not something also so cheap that
it can be sold, it's invaluable. It's invaluable.

01:37:30.433 --> 01:37:38.054
It's your right to get it. And also it's your
sensibility that you should grow into it.

01:37:38.054 --> 01:37:47.203
For example, in England, when I first came,
I had to deal with the drug addicts, they

01:37:47.203 --> 01:37:55.484
were the first who came. Perhaps, they were
seeking in drugs the Truth. When they came,

01:37:55.484 --> 01:38:02.284
overnight they gave up their drugs - overnight
- even alcohol - people gave up overnight,

01:38:02.284 --> 01:38:09.994
overnight. Believe Me, they are here now,
I know they are sitting here.

01:38:09.994 --> 01:38:18.664
Now, this is the minimum, and so many people
got cured. I really wanted that something

01:38:18.664 --> 01:38:25.264
should be written about the miracles of Sahaja
Yoga. So I told one gentleman, Englishman

01:38:25.264 --> 01:38:30.544
he is, he wrote to Me " Mother, it's not even
one month, from both the sides, all the letters

01:38:30.544 --> 01:38:34.854
have gone up over my head. I don't know how
to select. So, can you give me some time?

01:38:34.854 --> 01:38:43.894
Myself, I have no time at all. You can select
yourself. " With all this, why don't you experiment

01:38:43.894 --> 01:38:51.604
and why don't you grow? You are very important,
this is what you don't understand: that you

01:38:51.604 --> 01:38:58.054
have been born in this country or you have
come to this country - whatever it is - it

01:38:58.054 --> 01:39:09.453
is a very important, significant place and
a life of yours. But you should understand

01:39:09.453 --> 01:39:18.963
that it's very important and that you should
grow. But it is beyond Me to understand that

01:39:18.963 --> 01:39:29.574
in a place like Austria, in a place like Italy,
how is it, they have understood it and they're

01:39:29.574 --> 01:39:37.304
automatically working it out? I, you know,
I have crossed My 75 years of age and I don't

01:39:37.304 --> 01:39:48.134
know how long I will have to live to face
the English people and how will they understand!

01:39:48.134 --> 01:39:51.844
Sometimes, it's beyond Me.

01:39:51.844 --> 01:40:00.064
But now you will know that it is a science
and the scientists have said that they have

01:40:00.064 --> 01:40:08.574
seen the cosmic energy emitted out of My head.
That's a fact that Sahaja Yogis know. Sahaja

01:40:08.574 --> 01:40:15.873
Yogis know, they have felt it, they have got
this experience. For them, it's nothing new

01:40:15.873 --> 01:40:21.774
- not through science - but they have known
it as an experience.

01:40:21.774 --> 01:40:31.443
Now for you... You are also very well-educated
people, everywhere, you are respected very

01:40:31.443 --> 01:40:40.953
much, it is for you now to evaluate your own
personality and understand: Why are you on

01:40:40.953 --> 01:40:52.314
this earth? What is the purpose? So many of
you got Realization last time, but you are

01:40:52.314 --> 01:40:58.744
nowhere, you've done nothing... I mean, you've
got your Realization, all right. Each person

01:40:58.744 --> 01:41:11.874
can give Realization to thousands of people
if he gets out of his own, I should say, own

01:41:11.874 --> 01:41:23.844
ideas. And this can do such a lot of good
to the whole world. Formerly, in America it

01:41:23.844 --> 01:41:31.183
was terrible, because all kinds of funny people
went there, to make money. So, they told Me

01:41:31.183 --> 01:41:37.394
" If you don't ask for money, Mother, in America
nobody will come. They have to pay for it,

01:41:37.394 --> 01:41:43.334
otherwise they don't value it. " I said " But,
sorry, you cannot, how much, you tell Me how

01:41:43.334 --> 01:41:49.504
much should I charge. How much do you charge
for your mother's love? Then you tell Me how

01:41:49.504 --> 01:41:58.104
much you charge and then we can work it out.
" And it was surprising that it hit their

01:41:58.104 --> 01:42:06.594
heads. Now it's better. Same thing, I have
to request that, please, find out, when you

01:42:06.594 --> 01:42:13.574
have this experience of Kundalini awakening
that you are a chosen person for a special

01:42:13.574 --> 01:42:14.064
work.

01:42:14.064 --> 01:42:26.014
For example now, this instrument, if it is
not connected to the mains, what is the identification,

01:42:26.014 --> 01:42:33.494
what is the purpose? That's why then people
become hippies, they become this, then punks

01:42:33.494 --> 01:42:40.234
- because they have no identification. But
the identification is only one: that you are

01:42:40.234 --> 01:42:48.943
the Spirit, that's the Truth. And it has to
happen to you, that you are the Spirit, you

01:42:48.943 --> 01:42:57.014
have the power of the Spirit. In the light
of the Spirit you start seeing, start seeing

01:42:57.014 --> 01:43:06.004
and understanding so well about all the problems
that are in the whole world and your own problems

01:43:06.004 --> 01:43:16.034
also. It's not only Self knowledge but also
global knowledge of a very subtle nature.

01:43:16.034 --> 01:43:23.894
And that is all is within you, all this horizon
is there waiting for you to greet it. But

01:43:23.894 --> 01:43:35.463
I don't know why people have no confidence
or no understanding. Anything can be done,

01:43:35.463 --> 01:43:42.804
but first of all you must have the pure desire
to become that. Forget about everything else.

01:43:42.804 --> 01:43:52.264
For example, this power of, which resides
in the triangular bone. This bone is called

01:43:52.264 --> 01:44:01.134
as Sacrum, means the Greeks also knew that
this is a sacred bone. This power is of pure

01:44:01.134 --> 01:44:11.713
desire. And if you have the pure desire you
can become so dynamically aware of yourself

01:44:11.713 --> 01:44:21.134
and aware of everything. I was surprised that
in a far-fetched place like Russia we have

01:44:21.134 --> 01:44:28.824
to always take a stadium, you can't do it
in this hall, you cannot manage, I think.

01:44:28.824 --> 01:44:35.683
How is it, in that country it is working?
Because of communism, perhaps. They were so

01:44:35.683 --> 01:44:45.814
oppressed, that all the search started going
inside. But just in such a short time, I was

01:44:45.814 --> 01:44:54.074
surprised, these people, how did they get
it and how did they develop and they are still

01:44:54.074 --> 01:45:00.423
developing, all of them are developing. And
only I am the person allowed in Russia now

01:45:00.423 --> 01:45:13.074
to go and preach - this is also another thing.
This ignorance that we have, the problems

01:45:13.074 --> 01:45:24.213
we have - physical problems, mental problems
- it will all be controlled.

01:45:24.213 --> 01:45:33.153
Now there's a new disease, as you know, Alzheimer.
How it comes? If a person is extremely aggressive

01:45:33.153 --> 01:45:42.524
and torturing people, doing this. When he
gets old, his brain deviates and only that

01:45:42.524 --> 01:45:51.024
bad stuff start working and that person who
is suffering is not aware of it. And you cannot

01:45:51.024 --> 01:46:03.213
cure it, also. But in the lifetime, if you
get your Realization and you become absolutely

01:46:03.213 --> 01:46:13.213
peaceful within yourself, such diseases cannot
touch you, they cannot disturb you and you

01:46:13.213 --> 01:46:23.264
become a loving beautiful person. You don't
bother about what he earns, what the other

01:46:23.264 --> 01:46:29.653
person has got a personality, this, that,
nothing. It's just a subtle love you feel

01:46:29.653 --> 01:46:37.713
for everyone. For everyone, whatever religion
he may belong, whatever country he may belong,

01:46:37.713 --> 01:46:46.254
whatever problems he may have. Can you believe
in a place, in a country like Turkey Sahaja

01:46:46.254 --> 01:46:52.863
Yoga sparked like this. There are two thousand
Turkish people who are meditating and their

01:46:52.863 --> 01:46:58.453
Prime Minister's wife came to see Me, just
to get her Realisation. Now, what is so great

01:46:58.453 --> 01:47:05.764
about? They say Ataturk was their leader and
it is the one who has led the path. Why?

01:47:05.764 --> 01:47:11.754
You had such great people: William Blake and
so many... Shakespeare, this, that - they

01:47:11.754 --> 01:47:18.913
were all realized souls. Their poetry is not
just to read, but to read between the lines

01:47:18.913 --> 01:47:22.153
what they are saying.

01:47:22.153 --> 01:47:30.683
It is very important now, I request you, at
the end of this century, that once you get

01:47:30.683 --> 01:47:38.603
your Realization here, please, grow, become
more collective. Certain funny-funny ideas

01:47:38.603 --> 01:47:44.693
I heard and I was surprised - that the hall
is not all right, and that... - there's nothing

01:47:44.693 --> 01:47:54.814
to do. It's something that happens inside
you, something that works inside and gives

01:47:54.814 --> 01:48:00.814
you that beautiful feeling of being the Self.

01:48:00.814 --> 01:48:09.603
As a result, your health improves, you become
mentally a very satisfied and a very balanced

01:48:09.603 --> 01:48:16.903
person, all your stress, this and that disappears.

01:48:16.903 --> 01:48:27.014
Thirdly, you look much younger than what you
are, because inside you are younger.

01:48:27.014 --> 01:48:34.433
Fourthly, you understand others, you love
others, love to do things for others and all

01:48:34.433 --> 01:48:39.943
these stupid problems of fighting with these,
taking revenge on the person, killing somebody

01:48:39.943 --> 01:48:49.703
- this all disappears. That with the name
of God all these stupid ideas, which has created

01:48:49.703 --> 01:48:58.863
the global problem, will disappear. The time
has come and it is the Last Judgement. I think,

01:48:58.863 --> 01:49:10.234
the levels are changing: those who are chosen,
I should say, this path of Divine love are

01:49:10.234 --> 01:49:15.633
going higher and others, who are negative,
are going downward, they are getting exposed,

01:49:15.633 --> 01:49:23.734
everywhere, they are getting exposed. They'll
be exposed. That is for you to decide which

01:49:23.734 --> 01:49:29.324
way you want to move, what you want to have.

01:49:29.324 --> 01:49:34.264
I think, this is the first time I am saying
this to you, I've never said this way. I told

01:49:34.264 --> 01:49:42.284
you what you are - you are so great, this,
that and this, that - but despite that, if

01:49:42.284 --> 01:49:58.294
you don't realize your value is wasted. So
when you become the Spirit, then everything

01:49:58.294 --> 01:50:08.433
changes for you. I am surprised how people
start understanding the follies of their brothers

01:50:08.433 --> 01:50:15.143
and sisters, who are forming a big society,
things like that.

01:50:15.143 --> 01:50:24.603
For example, they give up drinking. When they
give up drinking in France, Sahaja Yogis were

01:50:24.603 --> 01:50:31.413
thought to be mad - because how can you do
without drinking? And now the French are taking

01:50:31.413 --> 01:50:38.054
to Sahaja Yoga very much. Imagine, French
are much more than they are here. And they

01:50:38.054 --> 01:50:44.863
are saving money because they are not wasting
on anything: no drugs, no smoking, no drinking.

01:50:44.863 --> 01:50:51.834
But we don't say " Don't do it! ", because
otherwise half of you will go away, but it

01:50:51.834 --> 01:50:58.703
just happens to you. For example, if there
is light, you can see everything clearly:

01:50:58.703 --> 01:51:05.663
whatever is destructive, you just don't do
it. But whatever is constructive we accept

01:51:05.663 --> 01:51:11.834
and work it out. Such love and such affection.
For example, these people who were singing,

01:51:11.834 --> 01:51:17.103
they're from all over the world, they are
not only British. Especially the British,

01:51:17.103 --> 01:51:23.274
very difficult to learn Indian language, it's
impossible. And look at them how they are

01:51:23.274 --> 01:51:29.913
singing. And not only that, but singing Indian
classical music, which is a very difficult

01:51:29.913 --> 01:51:39.903
thing. I didn't teach them. It's very surprising,
how things work out. So many artists I know,

01:51:39.903 --> 01:51:49.843
who have earned the world fame with Sahaja
Yoga. But we have an Academy and so many foreign

01:51:49.843 --> 01:51:57.133
boys went there and studied Indian music.
I was amazed: in three months they were singing

01:51:57.133 --> 01:52:04.824
Malkaus raga with all elaborations. Impossible!
How can they do all that? Also there's one

01:52:04.824 --> 01:52:12.754
boy I know - he was hardly fourteen years
of age when he came to Me - and within one

01:52:12.754 --> 01:52:21.893
year's time he is a great violonist, he plays
Mozart without seeing any papers, anything.

01:52:21.893 --> 01:52:30.643
How can do it? He was not like that. And he
writes such beautiful poetry. You can't believe

01:52:30.643 --> 01:52:36.463
it! I asked him " When did you start? " - " After
seeing You, Mother, I don't know why I'm writing.

01:52:36.463 --> 01:52:47.404
" I have seen people, who are scientists have
become poets. Can't understand, how your sleeping

01:52:47.404 --> 01:52:55.933
- or I would say - dormant qualities just
come out. You don't run after success, you

01:52:55.933 --> 01:53:03.024
don't run after competition, but automatically
it happens. For that you don't have to worry

01:53:03.024 --> 01:53:11.534
" I am old, how can it happen? " - nothing.
At any age it can happen to you. At any time

01:53:11.534 --> 01:53:23.353
it can happen to you. So don't doubt about
yourself also. Then you become a very loving

01:53:23.353 --> 01:53:33.433
sweet person, very sensible and dignified.
You don't insult others, don't trouble others,

01:53:33.433 --> 01:53:40.103
but you help, you share the difficulties of
others. Suddenly you find, you've become a

01:53:40.103 --> 01:53:49.373
part and parcel of a great collective which
is working in the whole world. It is very

01:53:49.373 --> 01:53:58.183
surprising, how you have brothers and sisters
all over the world and wherever you go, they'll

01:53:58.183 --> 01:54:06.284
give their life for you. Have you seen such
a family anywhere? Beautiful people!

01:54:06.284 --> 01:54:13.113
So, I have to make a request to you. Today,
of course, I'll try to give you Self-Realisation,

01:54:13.113 --> 01:54:20.984
if possible, it works out. But you must respect,
you must respect and you must grow. All the

01:54:20.984 --> 01:54:24.173
saints have talked about it in India.

01:54:24.173 --> 01:54:37.774
Now, we have here lots of people from, say,
Punjab, the Sikhs are there. And all these

01:54:37.774 --> 01:54:47.353
books have been described for Sahaj. He himself,
Guru Nanaka said " Sahaja samadhi laago ". He

01:54:47.353 --> 01:54:54.603
has used this word, all of them have used
this word. But Indians who are here, I don't

01:54:54.603 --> 01:55:00.863
know, they are... they say " We cannot digest
Sahaja Yoga. " They can only digest pounds,

01:55:00.863 --> 01:55:15.824
I think. Very surprising. It's very surprising
how this materialism has come over. But does

01:55:15.824 --> 01:55:24.173
it give happiness to anyone? Does it give
joy, does it give friendship? Full of jealousy,

01:55:24.173 --> 01:55:32.633
competition - all nonsense is going on. You
overcome all that just like this, you enjoy,

01:55:32.633 --> 01:55:38.843
everything. If somebody has a good furniture,
all right, this is a very nice carpet, all

01:55:38.843 --> 01:55:47.304
right, so what you do, you look at it, you
enjoy. You enjoy whatever is created beautiful.

01:55:47.304 --> 01:55:53.663
You don't think about it, you don't react.
The reaction is that there's joy. What a beauty

01:55:53.663 --> 01:55:59.673
it is! You don't think who has made it, how
much it will cost, nothing. You become thoughtless.

01:55:59.673 --> 01:56:11.403
And thoughtless awareness is nothing but such
a pouring sense of joy. Joy which is neither

01:56:11.403 --> 01:56:19.203
happiness or unhappiness, but singular. You
cannot describe it in words but you can really

01:56:19.203 --> 01:56:26.994
feel it inside yourself, that joy of being
the Self. And that's the time has come for

01:56:26.994 --> 01:56:32.453
you to get it. You are also here for that
and this is the special time when it is going

01:56:32.453 --> 01:56:42.923
to work out. Now you feel also a collective
consciousness, that you can feel on your fingertips

01:56:42.923 --> 01:56:49.713
the chakras, the centres of other people and
who is the other? On your centres you can

01:56:49.713 --> 01:56:54.534
feel your problems, in the same way you can
see the problems of others. If you can cure

01:56:54.534 --> 01:57:00.463
your own centres, you can easily cure the
centres of others. Without any money, without

01:57:00.463 --> 01:57:08.824
any fuss, without anything. It's very, very
simple, it is all built-in within you. All

01:57:08.824 --> 01:57:17.834
this is built-in within you and this built-in
power starts working. You don't have to do

01:57:17.834 --> 01:57:24.074
anything. It's all there, for example you
see so many lights are here: you switch on

01:57:24.074 --> 01:57:32.084
and you get all the lights. But you know how
to switch on: it's all built-in. Again I say,

01:57:32.084 --> 01:57:37.673
you don't have to stand on your heads, you
don't have to break your necks, nothing. As

01:57:37.673 --> 01:57:50.034
you are you are wonderful. And this is your
own individual mother: She is your own, She

01:57:50.034 --> 01:57:58.554
has no other child, and She knows everything
about you. As you have in the tape, you see:

01:57:58.554 --> 01:58:05.514
She knows your past, She knows your aspirations,
She knows you very well and She is the one

01:58:05.514 --> 01:58:13.054
who is going to give your second birth. She
is your mother. She loves you. Now there are

01:58:13.054 --> 01:58:21.223
books saying that if you have the Kundalini,
She disturbs you, it is the modern ones. Well,

01:58:21.223 --> 01:58:26.554
they say that "burns you". She is your mother.
Have you heard, I mean maybe in these modern

01:58:26.554 --> 01:58:33.113
times everything is possible, but can a mother
burn her own child? She has been waiting for

01:58:33.113 --> 01:58:42.443
ages to give you this Realization. For ages
She is within you and now you don't give Her

01:58:42.443 --> 01:58:52.893
a chance to give you a second birth? How can
that be?

01:58:52.893 --> 01:59:01.203
You will understand that all these great incarnations
who came on this earth have helped to build

01:59:01.203 --> 01:59:09.603
up this. They are all there within you, on
these centres, which you'll find out. And

01:59:09.603 --> 01:59:16.203
all these fights going on stupidly in the
name of God or anything is nonsense because

01:59:16.203 --> 01:59:25.703
they are all one. We are only fighting. So
all your global problems, all your fighting

01:59:25.703 --> 01:59:35.484
problems, all your family problems and the
word "problems" disappears. It happens. It

01:59:35.484 --> 01:59:46.893
must happen, because you are specially blessed,
and you are the Spirit. This collectiveness

01:59:46.893 --> 01:59:53.683
gives you the feeling of oneness with others.
Not out of jealousy, not out of greed, not

01:59:53.683 --> 02:00:02.744
out of any carnal love or anything, but it
is just pure love, pure love which you have

02:00:02.744 --> 02:00:10.024
not experienced. All the perversions drop
out... But you don't become sort of an abnormal

02:00:10.024 --> 02:00:18.613
person on the street, you see, walking with
your closed eyes, no. You become an enlightened

02:00:18.613 --> 02:00:26.064
person, absolutely normal. You dress up normally
outside, you can live with your life. But

02:00:26.064 --> 02:00:31.324
then you understand what is your dignity,
your decency and everything. There's no show

02:00:31.324 --> 02:00:41.093
outside of your achievement but you know within
yourself. You also know who is a Realised

02:00:41.093 --> 02:00:52.193
soul and then you meet. There's such a connection.
Has been always, but now it becomes obvious,

02:00:52.193 --> 02:01:01.463
evident and you can work it out. The most
important thing is that your brain opens out

02:01:01.463 --> 02:01:11.693
like this, like a lotus. It opens out. All
the problems of brain drop out. How many diseases

02:01:11.693 --> 02:01:18.653
there are of brain, I wanted to know, so there's
such a big book. I said, "My Goodness, more

02:01:18.653 --> 02:01:26.264
than the petals we have in the brain". And
it can happen to anybody in the modern times.

02:01:26.264 --> 02:01:34.723
It's very common, it's awaiting at your door,
sort. All this can be solved, absolutely you

02:01:34.723 --> 02:01:43.014
can be saved, you can be protected. And every
time you will be feeling this: you are protected,

02:01:43.014 --> 02:01:47.183
there is somebody to protect you, to encourage
you, to look after. Who is that? That is this

02:01:47.183 --> 02:01:56.663
Param Chaitanya. That is this, they call it
Ruh, they call it the All-pervading Power

02:01:56.663 --> 02:02:02.514
of Divine Love, they also call it the Cool
Breeze of the Holy Ghost, as you feel a cool

02:02:02.514 --> 02:02:09.484
breeze on your fingertips. It's all written
there in all the books, but symbolically,

02:02:09.484 --> 02:02:15.004
so people don't understand.

02:02:15.004 --> 02:02:31.153
Once it happens, then you are in another world.
Such miracles, such help and such protection!

02:02:31.153 --> 02:02:39.383
It's a thing where you feel, you can never
be drowned in the ocean of this mad world,

02:02:39.383 --> 02:02:47.653
because now you are in the Ocean of joy. You
are enjoying and this is what you have to

02:02:47.653 --> 02:02:55.413
have. But you must grow, all of you must grow.
I am staying on for one day more just to come

02:02:55.413 --> 02:03:00.324
to follow-up meeting. Also if you have any
complaints you better bring them. But there

02:03:00.324 --> 02:03:04.713
is nothing to complain actually, you should
complain against yourself. Either you are

02:03:04.713 --> 02:03:11.923
lazy, or you are too enthusiastic or you are
infatuated by some sort of a nonsensical guru

02:03:11.923 --> 02:03:16.703
or something is there. Just don't try to criticize
others but see for yourself, introspect: why

02:03:16.703 --> 02:03:30.443
is it, why can't I do it? All this can work
out, I assure you. I assure you very much

02:03:30.443 --> 02:03:36.544
that you should realize that My coming to
England, living here for years together. I

02:03:36.544 --> 02:03:42.744
didn't come for Sahaja Yoga. I came because
My husband got a job here. And then, seeing

02:03:42.744 --> 02:04:01.143
people in England, I thought, they can really
achieve a lot.

02:04:01.143 --> 02:04:19.673
May God bless you all!

02:04:19.673 --> 02:04:25.524
Derek is asking Me, "Better give them Realization."
I know, they are ready to get it, but they

02:04:25.524 --> 02:04:31.564
have to grow, that's the point, I'm telling
you. He feels quite helpless and he doesn't

02:04:31.564 --> 02:04:42.443
know what is the matter with them. I told
him " You grow some beard, moustaches. " Maybe

02:04:42.443 --> 02:04:53.754
a better idea. Might be they're used to things
like that. It's nothing external. It is the

02:04:53.754 --> 02:05:01.873
internal beauty that we have to know.

02:05:01.873 --> 02:05:12.284
Now, it's very simple. If it doesn't shock
you, I'll tell you there are two, three conditions.

02:05:12.284 --> 02:05:24.853
The first one is you have to take out your
shoes, if it doesn't shock. Because this Mother

02:05:24.853 --> 02:05:42.024
Earth helps us a lot - She absorbs all our
problems.

02:05:42.024 --> 02:06:00.804
All right. Now, the second condition is - which
is also not very absurd - that please don't

02:06:00.804 --> 02:06:09.874
feel guilty about anything. It's a fashion:
"I'm very guilty." - "Why are you guilty?"

02:06:09.874 --> 02:06:16.103
- "No, I've to confess - I am very guilty."
- "About what?" - "You know, the other day

02:06:16.103 --> 02:06:24.064
I was eating the food and I was holding knife
on the right hand." - finished. These norms

02:06:24.064 --> 02:06:31.343
are human beings have created this kind of
stupid things for which you should feel guilty.

02:06:31.343 --> 02:06:36.973
And that this center here, on the left hand
side, you get spondylitis, also angina, it's

02:06:36.973 --> 02:06:45.623
a fact - so, not to feel guilty! What are
you guilty about? If you were guilty, you

02:06:45.623 --> 02:06:51.984
would have been in jail, not here. So, please,
first of all, forgive yourself completely.

02:06:51.984 --> 02:07:02.663
You are not guilty, I assure you. There's
a new evolution with people's mind that they

02:07:02.663 --> 02:07:09.524
should feel guilty - finished. If you are
guilty, when it happens, you should have done

02:07:09.524 --> 02:07:18.333
something about it, forget it. Why are you
carrying that load on your left Vishuddhi,

02:07:18.333 --> 02:07:21.393
here? This is the second one.

02:07:21.393 --> 02:07:29.583
And the third one is - I think, is also very
simple - is to forgive yourself, as I said,

02:07:29.583 --> 02:07:35.733
and forgive others. Now, you say " Mother,
we can't, just we can't, it's very difficult.

02:07:35.733 --> 02:07:40.703
" But try to understand the logic: whether
you forgive or don't forgive, what do you

02:07:40.703 --> 02:07:50.843
do? Nothing, just the same. But say, if you
don't forgive, then what happens: you play

02:07:50.843 --> 02:07:58.203
into wrong hands, you torture yourself. So,
just say in your heart " Mother, I forgive

02:07:58.203 --> 02:08:05.304
myself fully, I forgive others fully " - whether
they are in your mind or not, just say that

02:08:05.304 --> 02:08:09.903
and your this center will open now in no time.

02:08:09.903 --> 02:08:20.213
This will all help Me a lot. These tree things
are very important and I know you can get

02:08:20.213 --> 02:08:26.984
your Realization in no time.

02:08:26.984 --> 02:08:34.873
So to put your hands like this towards Me,
like this, just simple, as if you are asking

02:08:34.873 --> 02:08:44.673
for your Self realization, like this. Need
not be higher, just whatever is comfortable.

02:08:44.673 --> 02:08:48.744
People can't believe that sitting in the hall,
how can we get Realization? But you deserve

02:08:48.744 --> 02:09:00.004
it. You get it because that's the time, and
because you are seekers.

02:09:00.004 --> 02:09:09.843
Don't doubt yourself, please. Have your hands
like that. Now, you can close your eyes, if

02:09:09.843 --> 02:09:14.284
you want to. If you don't want to close, don't
close your eyes. Because there is no mesmerism

02:09:14.284 --> 02:09:18.883
going on: at least, I close My eyes.

02:09:18.883 --> 02:09:34.754
Now, put the right hand towards Me, and put
the left hand on top of your fontanel bone

02:09:34.754 --> 02:09:47.204
area. Now, you'll feel some cool or hot breeze,
coming out of your fontanel bone area, which

02:09:47.204 --> 02:09:59.814
was a soft bone in your childhood. Don't put
your hand on top of it, you have to put it

02:09:59.814 --> 02:10:07.274
away from you, and you can move the hand to
see yourself. Don't say that you've got it

02:10:07.274 --> 02:10:12.524
unless and until you've got it. You are not
to cheat ourselves, all right. Now, please,

02:10:12.524 --> 02:10:21.573
put your left hand towards Me and put the
right hand on top of your head. You can bend

02:10:21.573 --> 02:10:33.044
your head, that's better if you bend your
head, and with the right hand you see.

02:10:33.044 --> 02:10:42.294
Once more, please, put your right hand towards
Me, and again with the left hand you see for

02:10:42.294 --> 02:10:50.054
yourself, if there's a cool or a hot breeze
is coming. Now, don't doubt it: if it is coming,

02:10:50.054 --> 02:10:58.504
it is there. Could be hot, it will cool down.
Can move up on the sides and see for yourself.

02:10:58.504 --> 02:11:07.264
Now, open your eyes and put your both the
hands towards Me like this. Now, watch Me

02:11:07.264 --> 02:11:17.154
without thinking, without thinking, just try,
you can do it.

02:11:17.154 --> 02:11:19.764
Ah?

02:11:19.764 --> 02:11:30.694
Now, raise your both the hands towards the
sky like this, push back your head. And ask

02:11:30.694 --> 02:11:36.054
anyone of these three questions three times,
anyone of them:

02:11:36.054 --> 02:11:41.864
First one " Mother, is this the Cool Breeze
of the Holy Ghost? " - first question is " Is

02:11:41.864 --> 02:11:54.134
this the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost? " Second
question is " Mother, is this the All-pervading

02:11:54.134 --> 02:12:09.134
Power of Divine love? " Third question is
" Mother, is this the Ruh, or the Param Chaitanya?

02:12:09.134 --> 02:12:18.884
" Ask anyone of these questions three times
in your heart.

02:12:18.884 --> 02:12:34.934
Now, again put down your hands, that's all.
Now, put your hands like this towards Me,

02:12:34.934 --> 02:12:36.044
just like this.

02:12:36.044 --> 02:12:43.304
All those who have felt cool or hot breeze
on their palms or on their fingertips or out

02:12:43.304 --> 02:12:55.894
of their fontanel bone area, please raise
your both the hands.

02:12:55.894 --> 02:13:03.854
Just look at that! You're proving what I've
said. Just look at that! Now, you've got it,

02:13:03.854 --> 02:13:07.794
now this is a responsibility to grow.

02:13:07.794 --> 02:13:15.593
May God bless you! May God bless you!

02:13:15.593 --> 02:13:25.298
Such a joy, such a happiness! I wish you best
of luck and also wish you a very, very deep

02:13:25.323 --> 02:13:30.483
understanding of your being.
