00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.960
This is the important thing that has to happen to us:

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.720
to become the Spirit, as Christ has told us

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.040
that we have to become the Spirit,
that we are to be born again.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.560
It is again certifying ourselves.
[By saying] that we are born again you do not become!

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.520
Let us accept one thing: we are not
going to live with myths and dishonesty.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.280
If we are going to be honest
with ourselves it is beneficial to us.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.447
It is benevolent for us to be honest with ourselves and
to realise

00:00:43.567 --> 00:00:47.313
that by giving ourselves certificates we do not become
anything.

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:50.153
It’s only a mental projection.

00:00:50.273 --> 00:00:56.665
To reach that absolute stage this Kundalini has to rise.

00:00:56.785 --> 00:01:04.052
There’s no other way out. 
And this is what is the Holy Ghost within us.

00:01:04.172 --> 00:01:08.572
This is the Holy Ghost, it the reflection of the Holy Ghost.

00:01:08.698 --> 00:01:17.060
And Holy Ghost is the energy of God, which is Love, which is His desire.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:24.323
His desire is the Holy Ghost, and is reflected within us as the Kundalini.

00:01:24.443 --> 00:01:32.492
So the desire of God is that you should become the citizen of His Kingdom,

00:01:32.612 --> 00:01:40.692
that you should enter into His Kingdom
and enjoy all the fruits of His blessings:

00:01:40.818 --> 00:01:46.762
understandingly, knowingly, on your central nervous system.

00:01:46.882 --> 00:01:53.181
This is his pure desire, and if that pure desire within us rises,

00:01:53.307 --> 00:01:58.922
then we see that all our desires were useless, and they are not pure, either.

00:01:59.042 --> 00:02:01.292
Because we have some desire, say, for example,

00:02:01.412 --> 00:02:04.925
we want to have a car: all right, have a car; then we want to have a house: have a house.

00:02:05.045 --> 00:02:11.322
They are never satisfied. 
In general, it is said that wants are not satiable

00:02:11.442 --> 00:02:15.463
because they are not [real] wants, they are artificial wants.

00:02:15.583 --> 00:02:22.712
The real want, the real desire, is this one: 
this energy of pure desire

00:02:22.832 --> 00:02:25.918
that says you have to unite,

00:02:26.044 --> 00:02:30.558
unite with the Divine, with the All-pervading Power of God.

00:02:30.678 --> 00:02:35.926
That is our pure desire, and unless and until that desire is completed,

00:02:36.046 --> 00:02:39.497
you may do any kind of things, you may go to all kinds of things,

00:02:39.617 --> 00:02:43.652
try anything: you can never achieve it.

00:02:43.772 --> 00:02:49.182
Now, this is a living process because God is a living being. 
He is not empty words.

00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:53.796
He is not just something like a dead book. He’s not.

00:02:53.916 --> 00:03:03.283
He is a living God. He is a living energy and this is a living process,

00:03:03.403 --> 00:03:08.932
so it has to be spontaneous. It has to be spontaneous if it is living.

00:03:09.052 --> 00:03:15.269
For example, there is a seed and you want to sprout it. 
Can you order it?

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.144
Can you mentally say, “All right, it has now sprouted.”?

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:25.681
Can you say that, “All right, I read these mantras 
to you, or Bible to you,” or do this? Will it rise?

00:03:25.801 --> 00:03:29.983
No, it won’t. It’s a living process.

00:03:30.116 --> 00:03:34.691
You have to place it in the Mother Earth [and] spontaneously it will rise.

00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:38.691
You don’t have to say anything. 
You don’t have to imagine anything. It will rise.

00:03:38.811 --> 00:03:43.329
And that’s what it is, that this Kundalini has to be awakened

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:46.662
in the same manner, in the living process.
