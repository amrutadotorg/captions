00:01.400 --> 00:14.640
In this Maharashtra, people walked miles together, singing the praise of Shri Krishna.

00:15.880 --> 00:19.000
They walked day in and day out.

00:19.240 --> 00:29.040
Some people walked for two months to come to this temple of Shri Krishna at Pandharpur.

00:30.400 --> 00:33.200
And you, too, had to do a little bit of that.

00:37.200 --> 00:54.920
So you can imagine those who must have walked day in and day out, sleeping in the open in between, where there could be snakes or anything, and then taking some food on the way whenever they get it, or maybe fasting.

00:55.800 --> 01:04.920
With great penance they come to this temple, singing the praise of God.

01:07.360 --> 01:12.999
(Speaks aside in Marathi)

01:18.840 --> 01:22.440
So, this penance you also had to go through.

01:22.440 --> 01:30.800
All the saints had to go through penances much more, much much much more than you ever have done or you could ever do.

01:31.999 --> 01:36.000
That was just to improve the quality of your life, quality of your life.

01:37.680 --> 01:42.840
If you live very comfortably, then the quality of your life is not all right.

01:42.840 --> 01:49.920
First of all, you do not understand the miseries and the troubles of other people.

01:52.160 --> 01:58.560
That doesn't mean you break your head with some stones and things like that, doesn't mean that way; I have to stri— tell you the other side of it.

01:58.560 --> 02:03.240
But one should know what people go through.

02:04.880 --> 02:05.999
Through poverty…

02:06.840 --> 02:12.800
Also for achieving God's grace.

02:18.200 --> 02:32.360
And one of the things, I was sure that you'll be reaching very late here; and I told people that no use making food for them, but I just kept quiet because… this was the thing was… there.

02:32.800 --> 02:36.240
But in any case, being Sahaja Yogis, you must have enjoyed it.

02:38.480 --> 02:50.760
And we have organised a program by which you can go and see a temple — which was really My great desire to build a temple like that — which will take about three hours, they were saying.

02:52.440 --> 03:02.240
The [temple] of 108 saints who were born on the… in… on this great land of Maharashtra.

03:03.440 --> 03:05.400
And they have made their statues.

03:05.400 --> 03:09.800
Maybe one or two may be wrong, I don't know, but most of them are there.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.200
All historical ones are there.

03:12.680 --> 03:16.480
So they have arranged your visit to that place, which you should see.

03:22.999 --> 03:26.200
Quality of life has to be improved.

03:28.880 --> 03:32.320
By not showing off; it's not a showing-off.

03:33.800 --> 03:42.040
You see, the cunning of the ego also can be only improved if you go through some hardships [in your life].

03:45.320 --> 03:47.999
Ego can be very much corrected through hardships.

03:52.280 --> 04:01.320
Because we are so much used to comfort and self-indulgence, our ego always is supported.

04:02.320 --> 04:06.760
And, "I don't like it, I like it" — we decide on two points, which is a very wrong thing.

04:06.999 --> 04:13.000
So to improve the quality of life one has to go through troubles.

04:13.999 --> 04:18.640
People very easily in the West say "I'm fed up, I'm tired."

04:18.640 --> 04:22.000
I mean, they don't even think that saying this will hurt another person.

04:22.640 --> 04:24.880
Very common; I mean, I was Myself amazed.

04:25.280 --> 04:32.440
Or, even to say "I hate you" is very easy — the tongue is just not educated properly, the tongue is not educated.

04:34.040 --> 05:03.200
So Sahaja Yoga is the new religion, in which your eyes, your nose, your ears, your tongue — everything, all these organs — are educated, taught — to say things, to hear things, to see things that are genuine, sincere, beautiful, and divine.

05:07.240 --> 05:16.920
If we could develop such organs, we will be the best Sahaja Yogis.

05:19.640 --> 05:21.640
Also, one should not complain.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.440
Anybody who complains is not a Sahaja Yogi.

05:25.080 --> 05:26.480
Your Mother never complains.

05:27.999 --> 05:30.999
When I'm tortured by people — you know that — I never complain.

05:34.999 --> 05:37.640
So you should also not complain about anything.

05:37.760 --> 05:42.080
For physical comfort to complain is the… baser thing.

05:43.280 --> 05:46.200
But even for other things one should never complain.

05:48.320 --> 05:51.400
Be thankful, count your blessings one by one.

05:57.320 --> 06:03.600
The best way to understand it is that we are the gainers in Sahaja Yoga.

06:05.040 --> 06:07.360
We are going to gain out of Sahaja Yoga.

06:08.560 --> 06:11.080
So, there should be only thankfulness.

06:13.560 --> 06:21.000
Thankfulness towards God that He has been kind to give us these things.

06:22.560 --> 06:23.920
That is the main thing.

06:24.120 --> 06:31.000
If you have that thankfulness, you can bear up all kinds of troubles because it cushions you up, gives you a cushion.

06:32.240 --> 06:33.480
And you won't feel it!

06:33.999 --> 06:40.960
Once you are in that ecstasy of thankfulness, you will not feel anything.

06:41.640 --> 06:44.280
Even the thorns of life will not touch you.

06:46.040 --> 06:51.999
So get to that ecstasy, it's such a great protection, it's such a great pleasure, it's such a great blessing!

06:52.520 --> 06:57.999
Get to that ecstasy of feeling how God has been gracious.

07:04.320 --> 07:07.760
You are one of the first Sahaja Yogis from various countries.

07:07.960 --> 07:15.520
Maybe after ten years or so, the other Sahaja Yogis may not have the pleasure of travelling by buses.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.960
(Laughing) May not have all these troubles that you have had.

07:20.999 --> 07:32.999
Maybe that they might get an air-conditioned, beautiful… what do you call… a bedroom, attached bath sort of a place — maybe, I don't know how they change all that (laughs).

07:35.120 --> 07:38.040
And they won't have this kind of variety or anything.

07:38.440 --> 07:53.880
But you are the foundation, so you are to be beaten up properly into proper shape (laughter) and brought out to that level that you can withstand all the [drunks?] and all the problems.

07:54.560 --> 08:10.520
Because the newcomers and poor-quality people can only be sustained by people of strong qualities, loving qualities, beautiful qualities.

08:10.999 --> 08:16.800
And the quality of life is the purpose of this trip.

08:17.400 --> 08:27.999
So, if you still have ideas of your comfort and all that, you better leave them in Switzerland, in Paris, and in England, or America.

08:29.120 --> 08:33.960
Here you have come to take up in yourself the discomfort of life.

08:35.280 --> 08:38.400
Thousands are living like this, in much less conditions.

08:38.880 --> 08:42.000
Why are you so privileged to have all the comforts of life?

08:43.880 --> 08:47.320
Why should you have all the comforts of life?

08:49.000 --> 08:56.240
Even Roosevelt has said that "Poverty anywhere is a threat to prosperity everywhere."

09:00.520 --> 09:04.600
In the body, if there is one place which is sick, you all have to suffer.

09:06.600 --> 09:14.999
So is best in collective consciousness to feel that pain, that trouble also.

09:17.560 --> 09:20.800
They have some other blessings.

09:21.320 --> 09:25.640
They have the blessings that they are not complicated; they are very simp— straightforward.

09:28.999 --> 09:30.920
They are not complicated people at all!

09:31.280 --> 09:33.200
They are very simple straightforward people.

09:33.640 --> 09:40.360
They are poor — maybe — poorer, but they are very rich because they are so generous, they're so generous!

09:42.120 --> 09:45.160
Maybe your health is better, but they look healthier.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.880
At least they manifest as healthier people.

09:48.880 --> 09:58.600
They work much harder than you do; they can withstand much longer the effects of hardships.

09:59.840 --> 10:17.280
So, we have to understand that, as Sahaja Yogis, it's ever our duty to improve the quality of our life, to see to things which are subtler, achieve that subtler… being within us.

10:17.280 --> 10:20.960
To be that subtler being, we should forget about the gross things.

10:20.960 --> 10:22.640
Gross things does not matter at all!

10:24.360 --> 10:27.600
If the attention is still on the gross, the quality will not come up.

10:27.600 --> 10:30.999
To become subtler, give up your complications.

10:32.999 --> 10:34.240
Too many complications!

10:35.320 --> 10:39.720
Psychologists have given you ideas, everybody has given you ideas — and it's all settled down in the head.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.960
Most of it is falsehood, is not the truth.

10:43.200 --> 10:47.480
Because nobody has talked about Brahma, nobody has talked about reality.

10:47.999 --> 10:53.999
So give up your… complications, your fears, your troubles.

10:54.360 --> 10:56.400
Just know that you are the spirit.

10:56.999 --> 10:58.480
And the spirit doesn't suffer.

10:59.200 --> 10:59.999
Doesn't suffer.

11:00.720 --> 11:04.640
If you feel any sufferings, then you should say that it is not the spirit.

11:07.160 --> 11:10.480
So the quality of life has to be improved on this tour.

11:11.280 --> 11:19.000
And they are all sorry that you suffered so much; I mean, they are much more suffering because of that than you thought that you suffered so much.

11:22.040 --> 11:27.640
So today is another day of the pujan (worshipping), and now the time has started.

11:28.360 --> 11:32.400
So, second day has started of the nine days, so we can have the puja.

11:34.840 --> 11:38.720
In India, they have restricted very much.

11:39.280 --> 11:50.720
Unless and until people have achieved the state of doubtless awareness, people don't allow them to touch My Feet, even to wash My Feet.

11:53.400 --> 11:54.400
They are very particular.

11:54.400 --> 11:57.360
Unless and until they have reached the state of doubtless awareness.

11:59.920 --> 12:06.999
At that stage only they allow, while you people are specially blessed because I allow every Dick, Tom and Harry to come to the puja.

12:07.480 --> 12:09.999
Which is a mistake, I know, because it creates problems.

12:15.680 --> 12:22.000
So one should understand that here they are very particular as far as the puja is concerned.

12:23.880 --> 12:31.999
They don't allow any half-baked person to come to puja; if there is slightest doubt about a person, they just tell him, "You are not allowed."

12:32.600 --> 12:44.680
Then the person works it out for puja, that he should become capable of coming to the puja.

12:44.680 --> 12:52.999
While in London or all that, if I say, "Don't come to puja," they will think it's a very good thing; I mean, they will all disappear in the thin air.

12:54.320 --> 12:59.160
Only through puja I can capture some people, but some people react, and it can be very dangerous.

13:00.400 --> 13:12.999
So all this dangerous game that is there in the West is against Sahaja Yoga.

13:15.640 --> 13:22.240
And as it is, in the West it's very difficult to establish Sahaja Yoga, very difficult!

13:22.240 --> 13:23.120
You know the reason.

13:25.320 --> 13:26.320
Is very difficult!

13:27.720 --> 13:30.999
Here you have seen thousands and thousands of people are getting realization.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.440
The time I am spending in the West…

13:34.000 --> 13:39.320
One day spent there — I can give thousands of people realization here.

13:41.040 --> 13:50.320
So it is more for you to develop wisdom and sense of responsibility.

13:52.520 --> 13:55.999
Because it's a very difficult place, West is.

13:56.680 --> 14:04.999
And if you do not want to make it a waste, then you must realize the responsibility that you have.

14:10.960 --> 14:15.160
Still, the West is in the program of Sahaja Yoga.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.200
I never thought I would be able to do [] there.

14:19.800 --> 14:25.280
But somehow it happened that I got to the West.

14:26.120 --> 14:27.999
People are seeking, no doubt.

14:28.680 --> 14:31.520
But the seeking is a fashion there.

14:33.999 --> 14:39.520
The genuineness of the heart you cannot feel also much, because the ego is covering it.

14:40.880 --> 14:47.080
Those who have felt it are really… are gems, actually gems they are!

14:47.800 --> 14:51.480
Are really lotuses born in the mud, I tell you.

14:52.720 --> 15:00.320
The quality of understanding of divi— divine life is very poor, and dharma is also very poor, we've seen it.

15:00.480 --> 15:01.560
I mean, it is so.

15:02.040 --> 15:17.560
So the responsibility of a western Sahaja Yogi is much more than that of Indian Sahaja Yogis — to keep the life very pure, simple, and dedicated.

15:19.360 --> 15:20.800
Is very important!

15:21.360 --> 15:28.320
While the whole of India I can manage single-handed; I really don't need Sahaja Yogis for that, I can tell you.

15:29.480 --> 15:31.680
But if you ask Me about the West… (Laughs)

15:33.080 --> 15:38.200
And all sorts of things they do; I mean, all sorts of tricks they will play, everything they will do to trouble Me.

15:38.480 --> 15:39.520
There's no end to it.

15:45.840 --> 15:54.999
So, one has to understand what sort of lot you are facing; I mean, it's like… [mad], it's like hell, the way things are there.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.600
Just open your eyes and see for yourself.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.999
Now you've seen these simple villagers, seen these simple people.

16:03.480 --> 16:07.440
Today I saw some boys coming on My Feet, about 14 year, 18 year.

16:07.440 --> 16:13.480
See, their Kundalini is just like a big river, just like a plain big river — nothing, no obstruction, nothing!

16:15.999 --> 16:17.560
No complication at all!

16:19.200 --> 16:20.999
Even old women I have seen!

16:21.800 --> 16:24.520
Giving bandhan to them just so sweetly you see them.

16:26.800 --> 16:32.760
So the responsibility is much more, much much more than [].

16:32.760 --> 16:34.000
So, be subtler.

16:35.999 --> 16:37.000
Do not complain.

16:37.999 --> 16:39.999
Develop your subtler being.

16:43.440 --> 16:47.120
Develop your love, your heart.

16:47.680 --> 16:48.240
Open it.

16:50.040 --> 16:57.200
I mean, West may be rich — I agree, they are rich, everything is there, you've got helicopters, this, that — everything. Aeroplanes.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.280
Everything outside.

16:58.640 --> 17:01.480
Inside — there's no riches.

17:02.160 --> 17:03.000
[It's a] [].

17:03.560 --> 17:04.200
They are poor!

17:04.999 --> 17:05.720
Doesn't matter.

17:08.999 --> 17:11.999
So the more you care for riches the worse it will be.

17:11.999 --> 17:18.560
So you forget that part of you and become dedicated to your inner quality of your spirit — which you are!

17:18.560 --> 17:21.200
You are gems, I tell you, you are gems, really!

17:22.600 --> 17:26.120
But we have to increase, we have to get more people to Sahaja Yoga.

17:26.999 --> 17:35.999
It's so difficult, that… imagine, in a temple we had a program — can you think of one church (laughing) where I can hold a program!

17:36.560 --> 17:42.000
In these at least, ten years to come – can you think of any church like that? (Laughs)

17:44.680 --> 17:46.680
Such dumbfounded people!

17:46.960 --> 17:48.640
They have no idea of divinity.

17:48.640 --> 17:52.160
Even Christ comes before them, they will keep Him out of the church.

17:53.800 --> 17:56.320
They've no sensitivity, they are insensitive people.

17:58.800 --> 18:02.640
So your lifestyle, your quality has to improve much more.

18:04.999 --> 18:07.999
And you have to take really yourself to task for it.

18:08.440 --> 18:11.920
Be kind to yourself, be nice to yourself.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.320
But do not indulge.

18:15.600 --> 18:20.960
I'm sure great people will be born in all the Western countries; definitely, I'm sure of it.

18:20.960 --> 18:21.999
Very great people.

18:22.680 --> 18:26.560
And they will really substantiate Sahaja Yoga.

18:26.999 --> 18:30.999
But you should prepare yourself to give them a complete support.

18:32.960 --> 18:33.460
All right?

18:34.320 --> 18:35.120
May God bless you!

18:39.360 --> 18:44.320
(Continues speaking in Marathi)
