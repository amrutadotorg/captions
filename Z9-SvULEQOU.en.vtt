00:00:05.123 --> 00:00:13.859
First and foremost is: time must be given for your development.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.674
Not to show Me or not to show anyone. It is between you and yourself.

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:25.105
You have to work hard to cleanse yourself.

00:00:25.213 --> 00:00:34.695
Easy to live comfortably with all the horrible chakras within us,

00:00:34.775 --> 00:00:39.514
but it is easier also and the best, most enjoyable

00:00:39.594 --> 00:00:45.956
is, to have very clean chakras.

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:52.989
And it comes [by], first of all, is sincerity.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:01:00.911
First of all is complete sincerity. Are we sincere to ourselves?

00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:05.106
Sometimes it is misunderstood. People think if you have to be sincere to ourself,

00:01:05.307 --> 00:01:08.591
we should deny Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:08.792 --> 00:01:14.732
Sahaja Yoga is the union between you and God,

00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:22.717
and the sincerity must be full, must be complete.

00:01:22.918 --> 00:01:30.907
Any kind of insincerity which comes into you is extremely detrimental.

00:01:31.131 --> 00:01:37.341
So you must know that, as your Mother has sincerity about you,

00:01:37.542 --> 00:01:43.956
you must also have sincerity about yourself.

00:01:45.315 --> 00:01:48.147
Then you will start enjoying Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:48.348 --> 00:01:53.302
That is very important to create integration within you

00:01:53.503 --> 00:01:57.365
because if it is sincerity, it comes from your heart.

00:01:57.566 --> 00:02:02.100
If it is coming from your heart then your body, your mind,

00:02:02.301 --> 00:02:09.453
your intelligence, everything will work hard to fulfil it.

00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:15.813
But if it is not coming from your heart it is going to be a superficial thing.

00:02:16.014 --> 00:02:20.748
So you try to feel it from your heart.

00:02:21.126 --> 00:02:26.468
That’s what it means: sincerity. Do not depend on anyone –

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:35.380
your wife, husband, children – nothing – mother, father. It’s your own.

00:02:36.284 --> 00:02:40.570
So you have to work in such a way that you get complete integration

00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:49.161
and the driving force towards integration is a very simple one: is sincerity.

00:02:51.136 --> 00:02:59.559
Thus you will know that automatically you are getting integrated.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.595
The another factor [which] is important is patience.

00:03:05.738 --> 00:03:09.147
You must have patience with others,

00:03:09.348 --> 00:03:15.249
because if you do not have patience, your sincerity will start doubting itself.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.397
So you must have patience and to get patience,

00:03:19.598 --> 00:03:25.736
you must know what you have been so far and where are you.

00:03:25.937 --> 00:03:29.085
When you will know what you were, you will have patience with others,

00:03:29.286 --> 00:03:32.826
tremendous patience.

00:03:32.906 --> 00:03:40.554
And by having patience with others, your sincerity will be all the time complete.

00:03:40.771 --> 00:03:46.407
By your sincerity, you will be completely integrated.

00:03:46.544 --> 00:03:50.083
So we come to the point of sincerity.

00:03:50.284 --> 00:03:56.942
Now let us go deeper into it: how the sincerity is to be maintained.

00:03:57.098 --> 00:04:01.539
First of all we have to make some determinations,

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.238
sankalpas (vows), of being sincere.

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:13.565
Then we have to act by finding out how do we get insincere on what points.

00:04:13.766 --> 00:04:19.086
You are good at analysing, you can find it out: how do you get insincere,

00:04:19.166 --> 00:04:23.171
on what points you get insincere, what are the correcting points.

00:04:23.372 --> 00:04:27.182
Keep a control on your mind to see how does it become insincere.

00:04:27.383 --> 00:04:32.408
You’ll be amazed that it’s simpler to be sincere than to be insincere.

00:04:32.609 --> 00:04:38.375
Is the easiest thing is to be sincere than to be deceiving,

00:04:38.576 --> 00:04:44.388
because you don’t have to think. To be sincere you don’t have to think.

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:47.403
If you have to be insincere you have to think, plan out

00:04:47.483 --> 00:04:55.412
and to find out methods, all the loopholes
and escapes, by which you have to run away.

00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:58.448
If you have to be captive of your sincerity,

00:04:58.649 --> 00:05:01.076
you don’t have to worry about anything

00:05:01.277 --> 00:05:05.339
and that sincerity itself is rewarding.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.164
This principle must be written down in your hearts

00:05:09.365 --> 00:05:13.063
that sincerity itself is rewarding.

00:05:13.264 --> 00:05:17.899
You don’t have to go to anybody else

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:24.275
to ask for the reward of sincerity, sincerity itself rewards you.

00:05:24.476 --> 00:05:28.708
And that’s why you start enjoying your own sincerity.

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:32.474
If you start seeing all these things as a witness,

00:05:32.675 --> 00:05:38.937
that how your sincerity has made you so beautiful, so dignified

00:05:39.138 --> 00:05:45.290
and how you have started rising in your self-esteem,

00:05:45.416 --> 00:05:49.857
you’ll be amazed how sincerity itself is a big force

00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:59.455
which will manifest its living dynamism
in you and you’ll be a transformed person.

00:05:59.656 --> 00:06:05.197
This transformation within you is going to change the whole world.

00:06:05.971 --> 00:06:13.301
The more alert you become the more Divine takes interest in you.

00:06:14.147 --> 00:06:19.419
But this alertness is nothing but the enlightenment of your sincerity.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.296
You’ll be amazed how sincerity is the thing.

00:06:23.497 --> 00:06:30.144
That means you are loyal to yourself. You have to be loyal and not disloyal.

00:06:30.345 --> 00:06:33.912
The loyalty to yourself is sincerity

00:06:33.992 --> 00:06:37.568
and that is how I have managed Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:37.694 --> 00:06:41.112
But sincerity is My nature, I don’t have to strive for it.

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:46.789
I cannot get out of it.
While, if I am your ideal,

00:06:46.869 --> 00:06:51.829
you should try to imbibe My nature within yourself.

00:06:51.988 --> 00:06:58.928
And then you will be amazed how you are connected with Me.

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:04.360
Then we all move like one wave,

00:07:04.561 --> 00:07:09.062
one being, one personality.

00:07:09.263 --> 00:07:17.083
That is the achievement of this Sahasrara Day.

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:24.702
Sincerity of purpose brought in action, not theory and philosophy,

00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:32.956
but in action, active sincerity, in every way, and patience,

00:07:33.157 --> 00:07:38.737
all these things will bring forth the complete integration within.

00:07:40.303 --> 00:07:49.065
Try to become sincere and sincere and sincere and enjoy your sincerity.

00:07:49.984 --> 00:07:53.792
If you can look at yourself as how privileged you are

00:07:53.872 --> 00:08:00.940
and understanding it, understanding what all Sahaja Yoga is,

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:11.053
then you will understand that what a privilege
it is for you to be here, what fortune,

00:08:11.254 --> 00:08:19.426
what reward for what you have done.

00:08:19.627 --> 00:08:32.333
How many lives have been completely rewarded by being here.

00:08:32.687 --> 00:08:40.726
This will help you to do puja in a more sincere manner.

00:08:40.945 --> 00:08:42.836
May God bless you.
