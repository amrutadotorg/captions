1
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,200
I think you can go down. There are lots of seats still vacant.

2
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,240
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

3
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,320
At the very outset

4
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,920
I have to tell you that truth is what it is.

5
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:32,280
You cannot transform it, change it

6
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:39,440
and unfortunately at this human awareness you cannot know it.

7
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,600
Now whatever I am going to tell you today,

8
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,520
you need not believe blind folded. We have already

9
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,200
suffered a lot because of blind faith.

10
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,560
But if it is proved

11
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,120
then as honest people you have to accept it.

12
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,560
Because it is for the benevolence of your being,

13
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,920
for the benevolence of your society,

14
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,680
your city, your country and the world at large.

15
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,960
So one has to understand

16
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,240
that we have not known so far the Absolute Truth.

17
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,000
If we had known the Absolute Truth

18
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,960
there would not have been any problem whatsoever.

19
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,520
Because everybody would see the same truth.

20
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,280
There cannot be so many [dead] dogmas,

21
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,760
so many discussions, arguments, fights and wars.

22
00:06:52,960 --> 00:07:00,120
If everybody sees the same point then who will fight?

23
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,000
For example I am sitting before you, you all see it clearly

24
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,240
and you know it.

25
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,920
So you are not going to fight that I am here or not.

26
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,320
For that we need a last breakthrough of our evolution.

27
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,640
As human beings, still, we have freedom to think whatever we like

28
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,600
but we haven’t got capacity to know the Absolute Truth.

29
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,760
If that is so and if there is a way out,

30
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,120
why not we try for it?

31
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,960
You have been already told about this,

32
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,360
this instrument that is within you.

33
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,600
I've never seen such a big one - today is the only...

34
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,360
In Australia everything is big I tell you.

35
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,520
Very nice.

36
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,280
I mean it can cover a very big hall as we had yesterday.

37
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,520
A day before we had three thousand three hundred people

38
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,960
and this would have been better there.

39
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,600
All right, as it is

40
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,520
this is the subtle instrument that is within us.

41
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,840
It's created through our evolutionary process.

42
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:31,320
As we learn, say, science and other things

43
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,960
from western countries, from Australia, from all

44
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,840
Japanese countries and all that.

45
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,920
We can see the civilization has grown so big

46
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,000
and we do not know our roots.

47
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,880
That’s why, what is happening is, people are waiting for a shock.

48
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,240
Already they are very much upset.

49
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,400
What has gone wrong with us that we should know our roots?

50
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,800
Now if these roots are coming from East or from India

51
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,120
why should we abhor it,

52
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,920
why should we condemn it?

53
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,960
Because it's very important

54
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,320
that we have to seek our roots

55
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,400
and this is the knowledge of the roots.

56
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,040
The human problems

57
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,440
actually cover all the global problems, most of it.

58
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,920
And to solve them

59
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:47,320
we have to see to this inner subtle instrument within us.

60
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,200
When these centers are in jeopardy,

61
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,960
then we get physical, mental, emotional, spiritual,

62
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,960
social, political, all problems -

63
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,960
because problems are caused by human beings

64
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,000
and human beings are in trouble because of these centers.

65
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,760
So if by chance,

66
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,080
you know how to correct your centers

67
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,000
and then to correct others' centers also,

68
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,200
you solve the problem.

69
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,960
Now this power that is being told as ‘Kundalini’,

70
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
is called ‘Kundalini’ because

71
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,600
‘Kundal’ means coils - it is coiled three and a half times.

72
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,360
It has some mathematical calculation.

73
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,400
Now this ‘Kundalini’ when She is awakened

74
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,000
She passes through these centers

75
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,320
and She enlightens them.

76
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,200
She nourishes them and She integrates.

77
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:54,520
Ultimately She pierces through your fontanel bone area -

78
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,800
in Sanskrit we call it ‘Brahmarandra’ -pierces through

79
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:05,160
and becomes one with this all pervading power.

80
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,280
So you achieve two results.

81
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,080
So the truth about you is that

82
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:17,480
you are not this body, mind, your ego, your conditionings.

83
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,400
Because you say this is my ego,

84
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,760
this is my conditioning, this is my house,

85
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,320
this is my wife, my husband.

86
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,760
So this ’my’, who is the ‘my’ there?

87
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,080
So you become the ‘I’, the ‘self’,

88
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,920
that is the ‘Spirit’, which you are!

89
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,880
And the second truth is that there is an All Pervading Power

90
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,120
which does all the living work.

91
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,520
Look at these beautiful flowers; it's a miracle, if you see?

92
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,000
They are different flowers from different seeds of certain heights,

93
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,280
certain shapes, certain colour

94
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,840
and you take it for granted.

95
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,400
You don’t even think about them how they have come out like that.

96
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,960
Who runs our heart?

97
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,440
The doctors will say: autonomous nervous system.

98
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,640
But who is the ‘auto’?

99
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,200
So we never question anything about living process,

100
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,000
because we can’t answer.

101
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,080
This living process

102
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,400
is done by a very subtle energy,

103
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,960
which we can call by any name,

104
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,520
is the ‘divine power of love’.

105
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,600
You can call it as ‘Ruh’ as in Koran,

106
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:49,840
you can call it as ‘Brahmachaitanya’ as in Sanskrit

107
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:56,520
and as ‘Ritambhara Pragya’ by Patanjali.

108
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,480
You can give it any name to it, is different but,

109
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,840
it is a power which we have never felt before

110
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:09,600
which is a subtle power which does all living work.

111
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,520
So, as if,

112
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,560
if you have not reached that source of energy,

113
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:22,360
the whole development outside is collapsing.

114
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,640
Also, supposing this instrument

115
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,000
is not connected to the mains,

116
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,960
then, it has no identity, it has no meaning. Why was it created?

117
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,800
And everywhere these days I find the seekers

118
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,880
are trying to find out their identity.

119
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,800
So what is your identity, is that you are the Spirit,

120
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,880
you are the ‘Spirit’ and this Spirit

121
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:04,440
is the ultimate that you have to become.

122
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,880
Once you become the Spirit,

123
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,680
in the light of the Spirit

124
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,480
you see the Truth.

125
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,120
First of all on your fingertips

126
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,960
you start feeling this cool breeze,

127
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,200
‘cool breeze of the Holy Ghost’, you can call it

128
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,240
or this ‘All pervading power of Divine Love’.

129
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,560
And when you start feeling that power,

130
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,200
is... your body acts like a computer.

131
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,760
You ask any question.

132
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,680
There are many people who don’t believe - there is no God.

133
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:45,840
I think it is very unscientific to say there is no God,

134
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,680
because you have not found out.

135
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,440
Without finding out how can you say there is no God?

136
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,160
They have all kinds of funny stories even about Christ.

137
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,480
They say He was not the son of God. How do you say?

138
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,600
You are not at that point where you can decide,

139
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,600
what is true, what is not.

140
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,840
Just mental projections,

141
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,520
they go on condemning all the great incarnations, and

142
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,960
all the great prophets, and seers and sages

143
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,120
because they are all blind.

144
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,640
Kabira says that, "O God, how am I to explain

145
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,720
to all these people who are blind in this world?"

146
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,120
Kaise samaja hu, sab jagah andha (Hindi to be checked).

147
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,280
So, Sahaja means, ‘Saha” means born,

148
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,520
‘saha’ means ‘with’, ‘ja’  ’born’.

149
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,080
Born with you is the right

150
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,800
to become a ‘yogi’, to have this union, ‘yoga’

151
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,480
with the Divine.

152
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,480
And it is very simple now.

153
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,000
In the modern times it's very simple.

154
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,960
In the olden days there were people

155
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,960
who were trying to give Realization, Self-Realization,

156
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,920
but they would have one or two disciples only.

157
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,680
And will...

158
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,920
they would not reveal the secrets about the ‘Kundalini’,

159
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,720
so clearly.

160
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,720
In the twelfth century

161
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,920
one great poet called Gyaneshwara,

162
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,640
he asked permission from his master -

163
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:39,560
his own brother was his master - that, "Allow me to talk about it.

164
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,200
And I will not do anything

165
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,600
but I'll just talk about it in my book,

166
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,000
‘Gyaneshwari’.

167
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,680
In the sixth chapter He wrote very clearly about it.

168
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:57,480
In Sanskrit we had, fourteen thousand years back

169
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,760
a great Markendeya who had written about it.

170
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,160
Sixth century also ‘Adi Shankaracharya’ wrote about it.

171
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,800
But it was all in Sanskrit, was not available to common people.

172
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,360
After this,

173
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,560
after the twelfth century

174
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,200
when he (Gyaneshwara) wrote it, the people who were in charge of religion

175
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,920
said that this is a

176
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,360
‘nishiddha’, means is something not to be read by anyone,

177
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,800
it's not, because they didn’t know what to do about it.

178
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,080
They had no idea, they had no knowledge.

179
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,720
They had no knowledge about the Divine

180
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,680
and they were in charge of religion, maybe making money.

181
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,880
So the second...

182
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,840
lot of people, saints came up in India

183
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,640
In the sixteenth century

184
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,160
who have talked about it,

185
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,600
all over the country, about this ‘Kundalini’.

186
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,480
In the Bible also it is written

187
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,160
that I will appear before you like ‘tongues of flames’,

188
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,960
and these look like tongues of flames,

189
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,760
very silent, beautiful.

190
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,960
In these colors as shown here, they look like.

191
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,320
And some people have described them, those who have been

192
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,720
moving round the circle.

193
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,120
But, to enter into it, to be -

194
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,120
supposing I see the light, I am not the light.

195
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,200
This is the point many people have missed,

196
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,240
that you have to be not to see something.

197
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,240
And once you become

198
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,920
then you have so many powers within you

199
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,240
that you start manifesting them.

200
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,920
The other day there were some these

201
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,160
‘born again’ people were just...

202
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,280
like mad, were there shouting, shouting.

203
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,640
I said, "You are not 'born again', what are you doing?"

204
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,560
You just call themselves ‘born again’, is not the way.

205
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,440
As we call ourselves Hindus, Muslims, Christians, this -

206
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,840
we are not!

207
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,880
We are really not because

208
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,720
anybody can commit any mistake,

209
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,120
can commit any sin -

210
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,320
you may belong to any religion.

211
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,800
So there's something missing within you and your religion.

212
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,440
It is not innately manifesting within you.

213
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,320
And that's the point we have to be

214
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,760
honest about it.

215
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,560
That our religion and ourselves

216
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,040
are not one with ourselves.

217
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,040
As we can see something,

218
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,240
are we righteous?

219
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,120
Innately are we righteous? We are not.

220
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,720
And there are temptations and temptations,

221
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,520
so what’s wrong?

222
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,200
We do all kinds of

223
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,800
things and as far as the religion is concerned,

224
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,560
still what you find

225
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,560
that the religion is not one with us.

226
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,600
And so many bad things are happening,

227
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,720
you see these Muslims being killed here,

228
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,560
these Israelis are being killed and this, I mean

229
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,960
it is really I can’t understand

230
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,960
how can you do it in the name of God.

231
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,760
Now this Bosnia problem is there and people are

232
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,560
dying and eating each other’s body,

233
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,880
that sort of thing. I mean, can you imagine in modern times

234
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,040
such things are happening all over the world?

235
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,480
And it disturbs you completely -

236
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,440
that "Why is it they don’t want to see the point?"

237
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,680
There's something missing.

238
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:45,120
With all that we have to understand that

239
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:50,440
if we have to solve the problem of religion,

240
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,760
one thing we must know, that all these religions

241
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,680
were born on the same tree of spirituality.

242
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,960
Only we have plucked the flowers.

243
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:07,480
and now we are fighting with the dead flowers.

244
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,000
Then where is the religion?

245
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,560
Religion is this part that is shown as the green colour.

246
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,520
You see the ten petals, the Ten commandments,

247
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:22,840
ten petals. And this is to be awakened.

248
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,280
That's only possible if this ‘Kundalini’ rises.

249
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,320
She is your own power.

250
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,600
She is your own individual mother.

251
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,680
She has recorded everything within Herself,

252
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,880
what you have been doing, what was your past

253
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,280
and what are your problems

254
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,600
and what are your conditionings.

255
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,200
All your ventures She knows.

256
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
It's like a tape recorder.

257
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,640
But She's your mother

258
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,960
and She is anxious to give you your second birth,

259
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:59,000
very anxious, because these are some special times.

260
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,080
I call them Blossom Time.

261
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,560
In the Bible they say it is ‘Last Judgment’

262
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,400
and in the Koran it is called ‘Khayyama’,

263
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,960
is the resurrection time - whatever you may call it.

264
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,960
This is a special time when you are born

265
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,600
and you are all seekers, you are born

266
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,680
to seek the Truth.

267
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,240
Be honest about it

268
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,600
that we have not yet achieved what we wanted

269
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,040
out of whatever religion we follow,

270
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,600
whatever way we worship God.

271
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,960
Some people have some sort of satisfaction

272
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,200
that, "No, no, no, Mother, we are very happy we have got this...

273
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,640
No, that's not so.

274
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,040
With this happening,

275
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,880
the first thing happens to you that

276
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:54,360
you develop a new dimension in your, your awareness.

277
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:01,120
Just now you are not even conscious of your centers.

278
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,320
Then you know your centers on your fingertips,

279
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,480
you can feel them also inside.

280
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,600
Like somebody will come and tell Me, "Mother,

281
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,920
my ‘Agnya’ is caught. Please clear it out.

282
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,960
Meaning what? "I am very egoistical.

283
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,400
My ego is troubling me."

284
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,520
Nobody would say that normally.

285
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,520
Nobody will even think he has ego.

286
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,400
But with this, you get separated

287
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,680
from yourself and you see yourself

288
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,400
and your problems.

289
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,520
So the first thing happens to you,

290
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,680
that you have self-knowledge.

291
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,560
And the second thing then happens to you,

292
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,760
that you have the knowledge of others.

293
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,200
That is the ‘collective consciousness’,

294
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,560
in which sitting down here you can find out

295
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,960
whose chakras are catching where,

296
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,120
what's happening where, what's wrong with somebody.

297
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,320
But you don’t talk the language

298
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,480
as we talk about, "Oh, this one is a corrupt man

299
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,320
or he is just like that, he has this problem".

300
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,840
No, we talk on chakras only.

301
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,880
This is what the disciples of Christ were talking,

302
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,960
the language of chakras.

303
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,680
You say that "this person has this problem,

304
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,320
this person has this problem".

305
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,640
And you start not criticizing, telling him anything,

306
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,320
but if you know how to correct your chakras,

307
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,640
you can correct yours and you can correct others.

308
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,120
This is the power you get which I call it as the

309
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,800
‘collective consciousness’.

310
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,440
Because who is the other?

311
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,640
Is what we say,

312
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,600
the ‘microcosm’ becomes the ‘macrocosm’.

313
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:54,120
The one drop becomes the ocean.

314
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,840
The consciousness of the ocean comes within.

315
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:04,160
This is what is just waiting at your threshold.

316
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,880
You can get it.

317
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,080
It's very easy because it’s your own power

318
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,480
and it manifests,

319
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,960
so that you discover how glorious you are,

320
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,160
how powerful you are.

321
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,720
When this power starts flowing through you

322
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,360
it corrects your chakras no doubt.

323
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,600
But also

324
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:33,480
in the light of your Spirit your attention becomes

325
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,160
very innocent.

326
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,640
Christ had said "Thou shall not have adulteress eyes".

327
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,080
I would like to see

328
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,840
any Christian nation where they don’t have

329
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:52,560
people of this kind.

330
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,440
So

331
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,920
your attention becomes innocent

332
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,920
and wherever you put your attention on,

333
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:05,520
then what happens? It acts, it works.

334
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,400
It works very well.

335
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:13,760
So you become a global personality,

336
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,360
universal personality.

337
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,720
You can spread your attention.

338
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,120
But you become so compassionate,

339
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,600
so compassionate that you never think of harming anyone.

340
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,600
But anything that is harming,

341
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,160
you just put your attention and correct it

342
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,360
in your own life and the lives of others.

343
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,720
It is unbelievable for people

344
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,560
to think that they can be that dynamic and

345
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,080
they can show those results - but they can.

346
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:49,320
Because all these powers are within you.

347
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,680
Please understand

348
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,440
that I have nothing to do with it. It's a living process.

349
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,960
Like in the Mother Earth

350
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,760
if you put one seed it sprouts by itself.

351
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,000
Because the seed has a capacity to sprout

352
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,400
and the Mother also has the capacity to sprout.

353
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,160
It's a built-in capacity.

354
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,080
And when the built-in capacity is there,

355
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:19,280
it just acts as a living process.

356
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,560
So far, at a human level

357
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:29,120
we have all limited memories, limited energies, limited,

358
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:35,720
we can call, intelligence and projection of mind -

359
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,960
and they are mostly artificial.

360
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:44,320
So you jump into reality and you understand what is reality is.

361
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,200
Yet you have not known the reality.

362
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,280
So confused.

363
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,120
What is reality?

364
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,280
And the reality is that you are the ‘Spirit’

365
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,320
and that this all pervading power

366
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,840
is flowing through you as realized souls.

367
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:13,240
As you know the absolute truth, you can find out about anyone

368
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,080
who comes and says, "All right this is religion, this is God",

369
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,920
or say, "This is correct"

370
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:26,360
in every area, in every part of your activities.

371
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,240
Who is the correct man? How will you know?

372
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,480
Who is the one who is telling you the lies and who the one

373
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,560
who is just deceiving you?

374
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,000
As it is, I am ashamed to say,

375
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,400
that from my country so many

376
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,520
have come to loot you,

377
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,440
take advantage of your ignorance.

378
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,600
But even there was one realized soul he would have pointed out

379
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:56,880
that, "These are all thieves, don’t go near them".

380
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:05,960
So this all pervading power is the ocean of knowledge.

381
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,640
I've seen people

382
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,720
who have been ordinary artists have become great artists,

383
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,560
even Australia;

384
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,520
musicians have become great musicians, talented.

385
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,720
But those who were government servants, as most of you might be,

386
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,240
who had nothing to do with art, maybe,

387
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,080
suddenly become artists, poets.

388
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,280
I was Myself surprised because I have always -

389
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,560
as you know my husband has been a

390
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,480
hard-boiled bureaucrat -

391
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,760
and I've seen it,

392
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:48,880
people transforming themselves into such beautiful personalities

393
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,520
and doing good work now,

394
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,160
working out everything so well.

395
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,560
So what happens, that

396
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,000
supposing you are standing in the water,

397
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,840
in the sea and you are getting drowned because of the waves,

398
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,320
but somehow you come on a boat,

399
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,680
then you can see the waves and enjoy them.

400
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,400
But in case you know how to swim,

401
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,200
if you know how to swim you can save others.

402
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,840
This is exactly what happens to you.

403
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,240
It is also true that most of the diseases get cured,

404
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,360
or if you are getting into any diseases,

405
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,680
immediately know that you are getting into this trouble,

406
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,720
immediately. It's not difficult.

407
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,080
Because on the centers you can feel it.

408
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,120
What center is going out of gear

409
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,120
and immediately you know.

410
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,400
If you know how to correct it, you are cured.

411
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,840
You don’t have to pay any medicine -

412
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,040
for medicine or anything.

413
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,040
Specially for diagnosis,

414
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,440
I mean, normally

415
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,480
a patient is killed before he is diagnosed, isn’t it?

416
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,640
But in this the diagnosis is so easy.

417
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,960
On your finger tips you can say what's wrong with you,

418
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,400
what's wrong with others.

419
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:22,200
And you become a very dynamic personality.

420
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,320
You must be knowing, I am 71 years of age.

421
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,840
And practically I am travelling every day.

422
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,320
Tomorrow I am going to New Zeeland early in the morning,

423
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,800
having a program in the evening.

424
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,280
This morning I came, I have a program.

425
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,880
It is working out all right; I mean nothing wrong with Me.

426
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,800
But I never think I am travelling,

427
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,640
I think I am there. As I'm sitting here on a chair,

428
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,960
I am sitting inside the aeroplane.

429
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:53,800
So the first thing that happens to you really is

430
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,560
a new state of your mind

431
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,280
which we call as ‘thoughtless awareness’.

432
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,400
That happens,

433
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,880
say, if you are thinking,

434
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,160
you are thinking about the future or the past.

435
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,320
If I tell you, "Stand in your present" - you cannot.

436
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,280
Present, you cannot, you cannot.

437
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,880
You are either thinking of the future or of the past.

438
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,600
And the thought comes like that, rises,

439
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,360
falls, again comes up, falls, like that.

440
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,800
Now we are jumping on the cusps of these thoughts.

441
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,600
But with the ‘Kundalini’ awakening, these thoughts elongate

442
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,640
and in between them is what we call is the pause,

443
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,760
the ‘vilamba’ where there is no thought.

444
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,720
And you are absolutely aware.

445
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,720
No thought - you are absolutely aware

446
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,840
and you are without any thought,

447
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,400
in your peace. That is how you achieve your peace.

448
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,160
It's no use having

449
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,080
peace foundations which I've seen.

450
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,600
Many people who have peace foundations, peace awards,

451
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,960
they are so hot-tempered

452
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,520
that if you have to talk to them

453
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,360
better have a barge pole in between.

454
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,440
They get awards for peace and peace and peace,

455
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,080
such a lot of money they have collected for peace,

456
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,040
but where is the peace? There is no peace within.

457
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,440
So first you achieve your peace and you watch.

458
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,120
As I said when you get onto a boat you watch.

459
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,320
And when you see the problem you solve it better.

460
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:42,560
If you are in it, you cannot.

461
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:48,440
So also one must know that

462
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,680
this All Pervading Power

463
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:57,120
is the source of all the blessings.

464
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,720
So many blessings are showered on you.

465
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,960
People are writing to Me every day,

466
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,120
at least hundred letters

467
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,920
saying, "This has happened Mother.

468
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,840
You know, this is my blessing.

469
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,240
This was a miracle, that was a miracle."

470
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,120
Now miracle has lost its power in Sahaja Yoga.

471
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,880
"This happened to me, this

472
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,560
happened to my health, this happened to my

473
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,680
writings, this happened to my....

474
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,360
I was going in the plane and what,

475
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,160
how I was saved and how in the

476
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,720
accident I was saved" - so many of them.

477
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,760
They can’t explain.

478
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,040
So that we talk of God who blesses us.

479
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,440
But we never felt that way so directly as we feel it now.

480
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,840
So much so that...

481
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,000
I was ....I told somebody that you better compile them.

482
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,280
Within months' time, he said, "Mother they have come up to my head.

483
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,880
Now you tell me what to compile."

484
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,480
I said, "Forget it".

485
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,960
Because the ocean of blessings,

486
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,120
believe Me, is ocean of blessings.

487
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:09,920
It's the ocean of compassion and love.

488
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,200
It forgives.

489
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,440
Above all it is the ocean of forgiveness

490
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,400
and it forgives.

491
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,080
So, such a great power

492
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,160
which is itself so powerful,

493
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:32,320
this energy starts flowing through you.

494
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,920
And it is everything is tangible.

495
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,600
Now if I say that

496
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,040
diseases are cured -

497
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,160
we have four doctors now in Delhi University

498
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:52,680
who have got their MD (Master’s Degree) in Sahaja Yoga.

499
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,320
It does cure, also cancer,

500
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,600
it cures so many diseases

501
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,800
that I cannot in this short lecture tell you.

502
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,760
But one should come as a seeker of truth,

503
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,600
not just to get yourself cured.

504
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,320
Because you will be cured today,

505
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,640
again you will have another disease.

506
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,680
Best is to get your Self-Realization fully

507
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,800
and establish yourself.

508
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,840
Sometimes these connections are loose

509
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,360
so you have to establish.

510
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,840
And most evident

511
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,960
is that you cannot pay.

512
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,520
You cannot pay for living work.

513
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,880
How much do you pay to Mother Earth?

514
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,600
So you cannot pay.

515
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,440
Everybody thinks

516
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,800
that God has a bank or something and He,

517
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,200
He earns money out of us.

518
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,280
That's your headache. Money is your headache not His.

519
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,360
So you don’t have to pay anything.

520
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,040
It's not like an introductory lecture here

521
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,280
and then you go back and start

522
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,040
paying somewhere else - not that.

523
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,160
You cannot pay for Self-Realization.

524
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,840
You can pay for this hall, maybe.

525
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:14,480
But you can't pay for this Self-Realization.

526
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,560
And once you realize

527
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,640
that what is your worth and value,

528
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,440
you really give up nonsensical things.

529
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,400
Like you belong to this group, you belong to that group

530
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,680
and you follow this type of methodology or that.

531
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,080
But what have you got? Now face it up.

532
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,440
What powers have you got?

533
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,360
Tomorrow you can get cancer,

534
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,720
you can get anything.

535
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,120
One can become mad.

536
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,880
I mean they are saying in America within ten years

537
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:48,560
65 per cent will be schizophrenic. Can you imagine?

538
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,800
Already I think they are very immature people

539
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,080
and if they become schizophrenic, what will happen to this world?

540
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,280
And they are so important.

541
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,720
So there's something going wrong,

542
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:07,720
we have to understand and we have to correct it.

543
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,800
The greatest thing that happens to you

544
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,520
that you enter into the kingdom of God.

545
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,320
No more in the kingdom

546
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,920
of any country, but in the kingdom of God

547
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,440
where you are

548
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,400
drowned in joy,

549
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,000
you are swimming in joy.

550
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,440
What is joy?

551
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,840
Joy is not like happiness or unhappiness.

552
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,120
If your ego is pampered you feel happy

553
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:44,520
and if your ego is punctured you feel unhappy.

554
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,640
But joy is singular.

555
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,400
You just enjoy, anything,

556
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:57,120
anything nice, beautiful without desiring to have it.

557
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,520
Now this power that is within you

558
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,560
is the primordial Mother

559
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:08,600
who is being reflected in you as ‘Kundalini’.

560
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,440
Surprisingly in many religions they have not talked

561
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,520
of the primordial Mother.

562
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:18,720
Like they have the father, the son and the Holy Ghost.

563
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,000
They have never said a word about the Mother,

564
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,160
the feminine part of it - I don’t know.

565
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:27,240
Especially with Bible, I think Mr Paul must have done it.

566
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,440
Cause I don’t know why he is in the Bible. He never saw even Christ.

567
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,680
All such things have happened.

568
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,440
Woman is the ‘shakti’, she's the power

569
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,520
and if you treat her like that then she

570
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:48,280
becomes something else. She is no more a woman.

571
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,240
Is a saying in Sanskrit, ’Yatra naryastu pujynte,

572
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,680
tatra ramante devanta’ [Sanskrit to be checked].

573
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,880
Where the women are respectable or respected,

574
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,920
respectable -

575
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:04,280
they have lost the sense of respectability, of chastity -

576
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,040
there reside Gods.

577
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,480
So all these things also, these ideas of

578
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,360
condemning men or women or this and that and

579
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,520
making divisions and divisions in this division, is never there.

580
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,480
It's the synthesis,

581
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:29,680
internal synthesis of the whole human beings, is the whole

582
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,680
world is going to take place.

583
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,560
As you know Sahaja Yoga is now working  in sixty nations.

584
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,960
Of course India, it is all right, because we in India we have this

585
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,480
tradition.

586
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,840
They know what is Self-Realization.

587
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,680
But in Russia

588
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,960
where they never knew who is God.

589
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,440
You won’t believe

590
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,920
that I can’t hold a program on such a small scale there.

591
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:08,840
Minimum of minimum, sixteen to eighteen thousand people,

592
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,560
a very learned, very learned people.

593
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,640
See, they are scientists and they are doctors.

594
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,160
And the scientists - I started on

595
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,760
science - they said, "Mother we know science, everything.

596
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,400
Now we don’t want to know anymore science.

597
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,400
You tell us why are we on this earth

598
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,000
and you tell us about divine laws.

599
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,680
We don’t want to hear any more about science, had enough of it."

600
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,400
Can you imagine they have bestowed

601
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,280
a very great honor on Me?

602
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,960
St. Petersburg University.

603
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,280
I don’t know if he has told you or not,

604
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,960
but surprisingly,

605
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,720
it's one of the oldest universities

606
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,600
and there have been only ten members so far been

607
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,480
and Einstein is one of them, you see.

608
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,920
I said how, I felt very amazed, was...

609
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,920
I felt very shy with the whole thing.

610
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,040
They said, "Why Einstein? Einstein only worked on matter,

611
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,200
you are working on human beings".

612
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,760
I said, "I am not working; it is their own desire

613
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,880
is working, their own power is..."

614
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,360
So they are so sensitive, I can't understand.

615
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,360
Seventy per cent of

616
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,320
Russians are extremely

617
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:30,120
sensitive to spirituality - all Eastern bloc.

618
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:34,200
We have been busy with our materialism, with our choices this...

619
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,800
Where have we landed?

620
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,560
And when they had the coup I was there,

621
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,240
and I asked, "Aren’t you worried?

622
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,800
Aren’t you worried about this coup?" They said,

623
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,600
"Why? Why should we worry?

624
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,200
We are in the kingdom of God, why should we worry?"

625
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,400
Simple answer.

626
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,840
Such lovely people they are!

627
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,440
They had never known Me, they had

628
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,800
never seen Me, I mean...

629
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,880
And no other ‘guru’ could stay there,

630
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,800
you will be surprised, they threw out all of them.

631
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,120
So this sensitivity comes I don’t know from where.

632
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,960
How they have understood that

633
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,680
reality is the thing we have to achieve now,

634
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,640
that we have to become the ‘Spirit’, the ‘soul’,

635
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:23,560
and not anything else.

636
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:30,320
I was amazed the way these people have reacted!

637
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,960
I don’t want to put a sort of a competition

638
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,880
for you or a challenge for you.

639
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,360
But definitely there's something -

640
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:41,280
despite their very bad government and everything,

641
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:47,880
how they have maintained themselves, so introspective.

642
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,360
I wish

643
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,960
people all over the world understand

644
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,560
that there are problems.

645
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,000
Your children have problems.

646
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,040
Other day I was reading that

647
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:06,960
you cannot avoid small children, teenage children

648
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:11,640
who are not taking drugs.

649
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,960
Why do they take drugs?

650
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,640
They are seeking something.

651
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:23,440
And they can’t find it - out of frustration.

652
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,080
But with Sahaja Yoga

653
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,520
people have given up drugs overnight -

654
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,320
I assure you - there are some sitting here like that.

655
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,320
Overnight they gave up drugs

656
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,320
and whatever damage it had caused them on their brains,

657
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:42,040
they have been recovered.

658
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,360
All these indulgences

659
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,760
that have suffered,

660
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:52,480
because of the genes, I think, genes, must be the [cause]...

661
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,320
The other day I read about the genes that

662
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,440
there are two protective genes within us.

663
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,680
Surprisingly they said

664
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,880
that Asians have them all the time.

665
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,080
So they take time to take to something like that.

666
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,880
One gene

667
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,960
protects you from being violent, angry,

668
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:18,960
hot tempered, cruel

669
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,960
corrupt, all kinds of things.

670
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:27,200
We can call it the father, the sin against the father.

671
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:31,160
And the another gene protects you from indulging

672
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,680
into destructive things: sex,

673
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,880
too much of it, I mean this all kinds of rapes and so many

674
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,920
horrible things that we have never heard of such things

675
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,960
that are going on in these countries,

676
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:47,080
where they are supposed to be developed.

677
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,640
And also indulging into

678
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:56,120
drugs and alcohol and all that.

679
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,520
This protective gene

680
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:03,960
is being absolutely awakened again I have seen

681
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,480
after Realization.

682
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:11,400
Whether you are an Asian or not, makes no difference.

683
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,960
But also look at these Germans.

684
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,120
They say that they are the highest race, you know they feel.

685
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,920
They are the ones who killed small little children in the

686
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:23,240
gas chamber and they saw them suffering.

687
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,480
How could they do it?

688
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,040
And they are supposed to be a very,

689
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,240
what you call them,

690
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,840
higher races. Max Muller says

691
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,440
that they came to India and wrote ‘Vedas’.

692
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,840
How can they write ‘Vedas’, these people?

693
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,080
They are not afraid of God,

694
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,960
the way they have behaved...

695
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,760
But now Sahaja Yogis, the Sahaja Yogis Germans, you should say,

696
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,760
the gentlest people you could think of, gentlest.

697
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,920
They won’t hurt you, I mean, they are so beautiful.

698
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:02,680
So this ‘Kundalini’ is the one, She cleanses all that,

699
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:09,440
makes you peaceful, joyous and collective.

700
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:15,080
Now I hope you all get your Realization tonight.

701
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,440
Have faith in yourself - that's the main thing.

702
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:21,720
You must have faith that you will all get Realization.

703
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,120
I know there are people who have some questions also.

704
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,120
These questions now I can answer - for the last

705
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,040
twenty four years I have been doing this kind of work

706
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,880
all over the world.

707
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,080
So I can answer,

708
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:37,680
because it's just a mental acrobat - I have become quite an expert.

709
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,800
But it is of no use.

710
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,760
By that thing you are not going to get to your Realization.

711
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,560
What you have to ask really is your Self-Realization.

712
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:54,160
This power is the power of pure desire.

713
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:58,640
All other desires, as you know, in economics,

714
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:02,160
that in general that they are not satiable.

715
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:06,360
You may be aware, may not be aware, but this desire is within you,

716
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,280
is to become the Spirit,

717
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,880
to become one with this All Pervading Power

718
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:14,560
and that acts, works and helps you.

719
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,560
Everything is tangible.

720
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:21,360
You will be amazed how it works,

721
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,360
how it helps you!

722
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,320
The second thing I have to tell you

723
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,120
that it is not an individual thing.

724
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,920
It is not that, you can say, "Oh!".

725
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,960
First day you may feel very happy

726
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,920
and very relaxed, on top of the world.

727
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,200
That's not important.

728
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,480
You have to come to the collective.

729
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,280
You must understand

730
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:46,960
the whole knowledge about your internal being

731
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,720
and you have to be with the collective to grow.

732
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,120
Like if I take out one, say

733
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,920
nail out of my fingers, it will never grow.

734
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,880
So it's the

735
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:06,680
whole being, is a living organism.

736
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,440
Only thing, you have to pay

737
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:13,720
some time, as time... for it.

738
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:18,000
They will tell you how to be in meditation, not to do meditation,

739
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,320
how to be in meditation.

740
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,520
So first you get the state of ‘thoughtless awareness’ -

741
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,880
we call it as ‘Nirvichar Samadhi’.

742
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:30,800
And then the state you get is called as ‘Nirvikalpa Samadhi’,

743
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,040
where you get all the powers of raising others' ‘Kundalini’,

744
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,960
giving them Realization, curing, everything.

745
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,640
Those who have never come to the stage become orators.

746
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,800
See these musicians singing Indian songs.

747
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,880
Can you imagine this?

748
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:48,080
I mean, English speaking people, so hard

749
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,560
for Indian music, I tell you,

750
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,080
especially for Indian words.

751
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,800
But when they sing, ask Indians,

752
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,640
they will tell you they sing like Indians...

753
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,440
It was so difficult to teach even one word

754
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,320
to the Englishmen in India -

755
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:06,800
one word. And now you see this.

756
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,440
What has happened to them?

757
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,120
How suddenly they have picked up

758
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:16,520
all the rhythm, all the thing, which is very difficult.

759
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,560
So...

760
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,800
all these powers which are within you,

761
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,960
you have to manifest

762
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,360
and enjoy your virtues, enjoy your virtues.

763
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:31,320
You don’t become proud, but you enjoy them.

764
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,560
You enjoy your generosity,

765
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,680
enjoy your compassion,

766
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:39,960
never feel that you are

767
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,400
taking too much trouble, you are doing this and that, nothing.

768
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,160
You think of others all the time and you live in peace

769
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,440
and create peace all around.

770
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:53,000
We have these people from sixty

771
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,680
nations; they come to India once a year.

772
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,200
I've never seen them quarrelling, fighting,

773
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:05,840
doing anything against each other - never.

774
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:10,040
How do they live from all different countries, from Chinese

775
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,880
to Africans, from Africans to English

776
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:18,200
and from English to Americans and Australians - so many?

777
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,880
In Sydney we have twenty two centers.

778
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:24,560
I must say Australia is one of our

779
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:28,320
very great country which has really

780
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:35,480
very enthusiastically has taken to Sahaja Yoga.

781
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,600
And I am sure also you all will.

782
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,280
We have a great story in our ‘Puranas’ about Australia

783
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,840
which sometimes I'll tell you.

784
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,080
So may God Bless you!

785
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:52,600
And you be confident that you will have your Realization just now.

786
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:57,280
You don’t have to do much - just it will take ten minutes more.

787
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,320
But, of course, I respect your freedom.

788
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,360
If you don’t want to have your Realization,

789
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11,480
you should leave the hall. I cannot force on you.

790
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,960
It is something it cannot be forced.

791
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,800
I respect your freedom out and out.

792
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,200
So, if you want to go, you can go.

793
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:34,120
All of you want Realization - it's very good.

794
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,960
Now one thing that should not upset you,

795
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,320
because I've seen people get upset if I tell them

796
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,040
that you have to take out your shoes.

797
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,480
I hope you won’t be upset with that.

798
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:59,000
You need not take out your socks but your shoes.

799
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,200
I does, sometimes.

800
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,800
Don’t have to say any mantras, nothing,

801
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,960
and you don’t have to concentrate also.

802
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:24,440
Please don’t try to concentrate.

803
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,800
Just keep yourself open.

804
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,720
Don’t force yourself into anything.

805
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:33,080
As I am saying, telling you that

806
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,800
it has become so easy now -

807
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,360
you don’t have to go to Himalayas

808
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,960
and stand on your head or anything.

809
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,400
You have to be very comfortable

810
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,640
and also

811
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:50,760
you should be very much pleasantly placed toward yourself.

812
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,520
Because as I said, you are human beings,

813
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,960
you are at the epitomy of evolution.

814
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:01,880
And you are...  have a right to have this,

815
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:07,240
because you are born at this time with a special purpose.

816
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,600
So in no way you should condemn yourself.

817
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,800
This is the first condition.

818
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:16,680
Have full confidence.

819
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,040
The another thing is you shouldn’t feel guilty at this time;

820
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,600
please don’t feel guilty for anything.

821
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,840
It has become a fashion now to feel guilty for anything.

822
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,640
I mean, even, if supposing you spill some

823
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,520
coffee you go on feeling guilty for your life.

824
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,960
What's this going on?

825
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,120
You must value yourself.

826
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,360
This life is not meant

827
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,880
for feeling bad for small, small things.

828
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:47,160
It is very great, it’s very precious.

829
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,920
So please don’t have any guilt.

830
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:52,600
But if you have, then you catch on this center here.

831
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:59,400
And this is such a dangerous thing because it gives you

832
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,600
what we call as angina.

833
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:07,840
It may give you spondylitis. It may give you very lethargic organs.

834
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,480
So very dangerous is to feel guilt.

835
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:12,800
So why feel guilty unnecessarily?

836
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,520
I tell you if you were guilty, you would have been in jail.

837
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,360
Now you are sitting here, so don’t feel guilty about

838
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,320
anything whatsoever.

839
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:26,640
I assure you, you are not guilty.

840
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:34,120
So, you have to really forgive yourself.

841
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:39,880
Now, the most simple condition is this

842
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:44,360
that you have to forgive everyone.

843
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:47,600
People might say it's very difficult to forgive.

844
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:51,160
But, whether you forgive or not - I am telling the logic,

845
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:54,600
now think about it - whether you forgive or not what do you do?

846
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,280
I don’t do anything.

847
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,520
But when you don’t forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

848
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:06,440
Those who have troubled you, tortured you,

849
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,000
are not feeling bad.

850
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,960
But you are the one who is torturing yourself.

851
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,760
But at this time, the problem is that this centre of Agnya

852
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:21,080
which is like this, absolutely constructed like this, like a cross -

853
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,560
it is on the optic chiasma -

854
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,200
and if you don’t forgive, it won’t open at all.

855
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,400
But if you forgive

856
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,440
it will definitely open and the Kundalini will pass.

857
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:33,960
So, at this juncture you as it is

858
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,640
troubled yourself so much,

859
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,880
at this juncture please,

860
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:41,120
please forgive everyone in general.

861
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:44,640
Don’t even think about them because it is a headache.

862
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:47,680
It's a real headache even to think of these people.

863
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,960
So you just forgive in general.

864
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:54,320
Of course we'll tell you how to do it. It's very simple.

865
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:58,120
Now to begin with you keep your eyes open,

866
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:01,400
I'll show you how you have to

867
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:08,040
yourself enrich your own centers - very simple.

868
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:11,520
So please put your left hand towards Me like this comfortably.

869
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,800
You have to be comfortable. That’s very important.

870
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,920
Please both the feet apart from each other

871
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,680
because these are two powers, left and right.

872
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,880
Put your left hand towards Me on your lap,

873
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,960
just like this.

874
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,800
And now

875
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:34,280
we have to use our left side with our right hand.

876
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:39,920
Now please put your right hand on your heart.

877
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:46,880
This is the center where the Spirit resides.

878
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,680
If you become the Spirit,

879
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,120
you become your own master in the light of the Spirit.

880
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,640
So please take your right hand

881
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,320
in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the liver.

882
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:05,840
All of you should do it, please.

883
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,400
This is the center of your mastery

884
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,960
which is created by great prophets

885
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:18,240
and seers and sages.

886
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,720
Surprisingly the center of pure knowledge

887
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,280
is lower here on the left hand side

888
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:31,240
in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

889
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:38,840
Whatever you have done, forget it, forget it.

890
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:45,680
Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen.

891
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:52,040
Now on your heart.

892
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,960
Now in the corner of your neck and shoulders.

893
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,720
As I have already told you

894
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,920
when this center catches what is the problem.

895
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:06,440
Turn your head to your right, please.

896
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,120
It’s very catching today.

897
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:14,520
Please don’t feel guilty for anything. You must...

898
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:19,760
There.

899
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:23,360
Please take your right hand on top of your forehead across

900
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,960
and bend your head slowly.

901
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:31,440
We have to be humble about it, you see.

902
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:38,320
So here you have to forgive everyone in general.

903
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:46,120
Now take back your right hand on the backside of your head

904
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:49,840
and push back your head as far as possible.

905
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:54,880
Here,

906
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:59,040
without counting your mistakes,

907
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:02,680
without feeling guilty, just for your satisfaction,

908
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,240
you will have to ask forgiveness

909
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:11,520
from this All Pervading Power.

910
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:16,640
Now please stretch your hand or palm fully.

911
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:19,440
Now we go to the last center,

912
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:22,040
so please put the centre of your palm

913
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,360
on top of the fontanel bone area

914
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:30,400
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

915
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:35,160
Now please put down your head.

916
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,120
Now push back your fingers nicely

917
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:42,320
so there's a good pressure on your scalp.

918
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:46,360
Now put down your head and you have to move, move the scalp

919
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:51,080
seven times clockwise very slowly.

920
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,200
That’s all we have to do actually.

921
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,960
But remember you have to push back your fingers.

922
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:11,160
Now you can take out your spectacles

923
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:13,240
because you have to close your eyes.

924
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,320
It might help also your eyesight.

925
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:19,680
Please,

926
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,920
before closing I must tell you again

927
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,920
that please put both the

928
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:26,560
legs apart from each other

929
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:30,440
and the left hand

930
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:36,840
towards Me on your lap comfortably in any way that you like.

931
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:41,840
And then now place your right hand on your heart.

932
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:49,320
Here, I've told you resides the Spirit.

933
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,400
You have to ask Me

934
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:56,880
a very fundamental question about yourself in your heart.

935
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:02,400
So please,

936
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:06,440
ask in your heart, three times.

937
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:10,480
You can call me ‘Mother’ or ‘Shri Mataji’ whatever you like.

938
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,880
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”

939
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,960
Ask this question three times in your heart.

940
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:20,280
"Mother, am I the Spirit?"

941
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,760
Now, I've told you if you become the ‘Spirit’,

942
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:37,480
you become your own master.

943
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,680
So now take down your right hand

944
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,880
in the upper portion of your abdomen

945
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:44,840
on the left hand side.

946
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:50,400
Here,

947
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,520
you have to ask another fundamental question.

948
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:59,960
“Mother, am I my master?”

949
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:05,200
Ask this question three times.

950
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:12,720
I have already told you

951
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:16,280
that I respect your freedom.

952
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,640
And I cannot force

953
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:24,240
divine pure knowledge on you.

954
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,920
So now

955
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,960
please take your right hand

956
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:33,040
in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

957
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:40,160
Here,

958
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,600
you have to ask six times,

959
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:46,840
because this center has got six petals,

960
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:53,800
“Mother, please give me pure knowledge”,

961
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:59,320
or you can say, “Mother please give me divine pure knowledge”.

962
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:04,920
Whatever is divine is pure.

963
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:07,680
Six times.

964
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:10,800
As soon as you start asking

965
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,080
for pure divine knowledge,

966
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:17,840
the ‘Kundalini’ starts rising like a primule.

967
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:23,160
Now we have to

968
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,840
open our higher centers

969
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:31,600
by our self-confidence,

970
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,240
for the Kundalini to pass through.

971
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,680
Now, take your right hand -

972
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:39,080
you are working only on the left hand side -

973
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,360
in the upper portion

974
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:42,600
of your abdomen, on the left hand side.

975
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,280
Press it hard.

976
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:52,440
Now, here with full confidence, please say ten times,

977
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:56,040
“Mother, I am my own master”.

978
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,080
The Kundalini wants

979
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:01,960
you to show yourself confidence.

980
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:11,960
Please say it ten times.

981
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,760
At the very outset, I've told you

982
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,600
that the truth is that you are not this body,

983
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:20,240
this mind, this ego, these feelings,

984
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:23,240
these emotions, these conditionings,

985
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:30,800
but you are the pure Spirit.

986
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:35,440
So, now raise your right hand on top of your heart.

987
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:40,480
And here you have to say again with full self-confidence,

988
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:45,120
“Mother, I am the pure Spirit”.

989
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:46,720
Please say it.

990
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:49,160
Please say it twelve times,

991
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:54,520
“Mother I am the pure Spirit”.

992
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,920
I have already told you

993
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:04,560
that this All Pervading Power

994
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:08,280
is the ocean of knowledge,

995
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,480
ocean of compassion,

996
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:16,080
ocean of blessings, but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

997
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:20,160
And whatever mistakes you might have committed,

998
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:24,320
are easily dissolved by this ocean of forgiveness.

999
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:26,200
So forgive yourself.

1000
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,720
And put your right hand

1001
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,480
in the corner of your neck and shoulder

1002
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:34,560
and turn your head to your right.

1003
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,880
Here,

1004
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,280
with full confidence again,

1005
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:43,120
you have to say sixteen times,

1006
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:46,800
“Mother, I am not guilty at all”,

1007
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,440
“Mother I am not guilty at all”. Please say this.

1008
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,560
Is very important because this center

1009
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:57,640
is catching very much tonight here.

1010
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:08,760
Now I have told you

1011
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:12,240
whether you forgive or you don’t forgive, you don’t do anything.

1012
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:14,080
But if you don’t forgive,

1013
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,560
then you play into wrong hands

1014
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,120
and torture yourself.

1015
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:21,920
Especially at this moment, you should forgive

1016
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:25,960
all of them, without thinking about them, in general,

1017
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:29,520
so that your center opens out.

1018
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:33,840
Otherwise at this important moment,

1019
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:36,680
you may miss your Self Realization.

1020
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,360
It's very important

1021
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:42,560
to forgive all of them from your heart.

1022
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:46,000
Not how many times, it's not the point, from your heart.

1023
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,840
So now please put your right hand

1024
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,800
on you forehead across

1025
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:56,080
and bend your head as much as you can.

1026
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:59,720
And here,

1027
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:04,000
you have to say,

1028
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:09,400
not how many times, but from your heart,

1029
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:15,840
“Mother, I forgive everyone in general”,

1030
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:19,960
from your heart. Please say it from your heart.

1031
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:35,520
And now

1032
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:39,040
please put your right hand on the back side of your head

1033
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:46,800
and push back your head as far as possible.

1034
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,160
Here, without feeling guilty,

1035
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:51,120
without counting your mistakes,

1036
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:54,200
just for your satisfaction,

1037
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,480
you have to say,

1038
01:08:55,680 --> 01:09:00,520
not how many times, but from your heart,

1039
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,560
“Oh, Divine Power,

1040
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:07,640
if I have done any mistake,

1041
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:11,720
knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me”.

1042
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,920
Just say it from your heart.

1043
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:15,640
“O Divine Power,

1044
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:19,480
if I have done anything wrong,

1045
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:24,400
knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me”.

1046
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,680
Now

1047
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:38,760
please stretch your palms.

1048
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,760
Put the center of your palm

1049
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:44,200
on top of your fontanel bone area

1050
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:48,520
which is a soft bone in your childhood.

1051
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,040
Here again,

1052
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:54,320
I cannot force Self-Realization on you. You have to ask for it.

1053
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:57,280
So now push back your fingers - that's important -

1054
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:00,240
and please put down your head.

1055
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:03,400
Now move your scalp with this pressure,

1056
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,280
seven times, saying

1057
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:07,880
seven times,

1058
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:12,920
“Mother, please give me my Self-Realization”,

1059
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:15,640
because I cannot force it on you.

1060
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:21,800
Please push back your fingers.

1061
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,480
Bend your heads; please push back your fingers.

1062
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:32,000
Keep your eyes shut, till I tell you

1063
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,480
please keep them shut.

1064
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:07,160
Please take down your hands

1065
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:12,000
and try to open your eyes slowly.

1066
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:16,440
Push both the hands towards Me.

1067
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:22,880
Now,

1068
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:26,360
put the left hand towards Me like this,

1069
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:30,200
bend your head and see with the right hand

1070
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:36,480
if there is a cool or a warm breeze-like energy

1071
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:39,960
is coming out of your fontanel bone area.

1072
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:43,920
Now don’t doubt, because air conditioning is not in your head.

1073
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:48,560
So just see for yourself. Some people think it is air conditioning.

1074
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:54,040
Some people get it hot.

1075
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,320
Some people get it far,

1076
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:57,560
some closer,

1077
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:00,800
but don’t put your hand on top of your head,

1078
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,280
away from it.

1079
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:03,840
See for yourself,

1080
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:07,240
and if it is hot, that means you have not yet forgiven.

1081
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,480
So please forgive also.

1082
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:11,120
Now,

1083
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:14,280
please put your right hand. Now, bend your head nicely

1084
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:17,120
and see for yourself with the left hand

1085
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:23,320
if there's a cool or a hot breeze-like energy is coming

1086
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:28,560
out of your fontanel bone area.

1087
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:33,640
You have to move your hand up and down, sideways also. All right.

1088
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:38,080
Now do it with the left hand again.

1089
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,640
Little further. Some people get it further.

1090
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:50,160
Bend your heads, that is important, bend your heads.

1091
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:54,760
Now,

1092
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:59,040
please put both your hands towards the sky.

1093
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:01,080
Push back your head

1094
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:04,040
and ask anyone of these three questions,

1095
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:06,840
three times, anyone of them.

1096
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,960
You can say, ”Mother,

1097
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:13,040
is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”,

1098
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:16,000
or ”Mother, is this the

1099
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:19,920
All Pervading Power of Divine Love?”,

1100
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:24,160
or ”Mother, is this the Ruh

1101
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,560
or Paramchaitanya?”.

1102
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,360
Ask anyone of these questions, three times.

1103
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:39,720
Now, just come down.

1104
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,680
Now please put your hands like this

1105
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:50,120
and watch Me without thinking.

1106
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:53,840
Just watch Me without thinking.

1107
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:07,680
All those who have felt

1108
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:11,480
hot or cold breeze on their fingertips,

1109
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:17,720
on their palms or out of their fontanel bone area,

1110
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,080
please raise both your hands.

1111
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:25,960
My God! Look at that.

1112
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,480
I mean most of you.

1113
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:29,840
May God bless you!

1114
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:31,520
It's tremendous.

1115
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:34,160
Some didn’t get it, very few,

1116
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,840
but most of you have got it.

1117
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,960
In any case all of you should get it.

1118
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:42,200
And those who haven’t got

1119
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:46,280
should please later on come to the stage and they will do it.

1120
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:47,760
But in the meanwhile

1121
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:49,560
we'll try something else

1122
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,440
for Realization

1123
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:55,080
and maybe that might help a little bit.

1124
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,960
[Marathi].

1125
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:01,880
See this might help.

1126
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:09,360
This will be only five minutes experiment. Let's see.

1127
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:12,280
Which song will you sing?

1128
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,480
[Marathi].

1129
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:20,560
[Marathi].

1130
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:22,960
This is the song they are going to sing,

1131
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:26,120
was written - Namadeva -

1132
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,760
by Namadeva in the sixteenth century

1133
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:31,760
who went then to Punjab

1134
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,760
and Guru Nanak Sahib, you see,

1135
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:38,600
knew who he was and He asked him to write

1136
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,120
poems in Punjabi language.

1137
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:45,000
And he has done such big compilation, I know that.

1138
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:47,480
This guru

1139
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:48,960
was ...

1140
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,240
he was just a tailor.

1141
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,520
And he went to see, meet

1142
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:57,960
another realized soul who was a potter.

1143
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:04,320
And when he went and saw the potter kneading

1144
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:11,920
the clay with his feet, he just stood there, watching him.

1145
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:14,880
The potter’s name was Gora Kumbhar.

1146
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:19,120
Looked at him and what does he say,

1147
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:22,880
in Marathi says that, but meaning

1148
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:27,000
that, I came to see here

1149
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:28,960
the "formless",

1150
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:32,120
but it is "in the form".

1151
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,120
I see it "in the form".

1152
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:40,880
I mean only a saint can say it to another saint.

1153
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:42,440
That’s what happened

1154
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,080
that he went up to Punjab

1155
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:49,360
where Guru Nanak Sahib

1156
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:53,560
called him, looked after him and asked him and they made beautiful,

1157
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:58,040
I mean such beautiful songs there are and they are in Granth Sahib.

1158
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:01,800
They are all in Granth Sahib.

1159
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:04,680
[unclear].

1160
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,320
This is the folk song

1161
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:11,240
which was written, which says, “Oh, Mother, give me my Realization.

1162
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:14,440
‘Jogwa’ means Yoga - "Please give me that".

1163
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:15,960
All that they sang,

1164
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,320
all the time they have been singing, even now,

1165
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,360
but they don’t know what it is.

1166
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,280
And they are saying, "Oh, Ambe" - means the Kundalini -

1167
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:25,280
"please rise, rise".

1168
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:29,280
And with you can also clap. It will help a lot, I am sure.

1169
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:34,000
This will definitely consolidate your Self-Realization.

1170
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:42,400
It is a village song. It’s a rustic...

1171
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:31,160
Now you feel. Just try to feel now. Let's see.

1172
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:35,600
You must be feeling more, just see.

1173
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:37,120
All right?

1174
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:39,960
Now again, let us see how many of you have really

1175
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:42,400
felt on your finger tips

1176
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:47,160
or from your fontanel bone area or on your palms.

1177
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:51,400
Raise your both the hands.

1178
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:57,400
Oh! So, who didn’t feel before, have felt it - so many of you.

1179
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:00,960
Thank you very much. May God look after you.

1180
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:03,600
And also have wisdom

1181
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:08,200
to respect your freedom,

1182
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:14,560
respect your new status.

1183
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:17,880
The real freedom is now.

1184
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:22,280
So you respect your Self-Realization

1185
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:29,880
and become a fully self-realized personality.

1186
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:33,600
That will help everywhere.

1187
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:38,320
May God bless you all!

1188
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:44,360
Thank you very much, it was wonderful.

1189
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:23,920
You all have paper to know where the centers are

1190
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:26,840
and I hope...

1191
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:28,720
What's it?

1192
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:31,240
...and where you are going to have

1193
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:35,000
a follow-on program.

1194
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:37,800
All right?

1195
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,120
Please, please come.

1196
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:43,200
Do you know?

1197
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:45,520
What's it? They haven’t got paper already?

1198
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:46,960
SY: They have, Shri Mataji.

1199
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:49,200
SM: They all have?

1200
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,040
Where are you having follow on?

1201
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:55,840
Yes, yes, but when are having the follow on, where?

1202
01:28:56,040 --> 01:29:00,280
You don't know.

1203
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:02,680
SY: As you go on out

1204
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:06,000
there are leaflets there which will tell you...

1205
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:08,240
all you need to know about follow-up programs.

1206
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:12,080
Ah, we've got one here, finally.

1207
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:17,960
There's a series of seven programs

1208
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:20,720
beginning on Monday 11th of April

1209
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:25,360
then for six consecutive Thursdays commencing

1210
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:27,600
Thursday 14th of April

1211
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:30,680
at seven thirty to nine thirty

1212
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:33,600
the [Far placed Room], Gorman House Art Center

1213
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:36,720
Ainslie Avenue, Braddon.

1214
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:41,000
And there's a little bracket here, and we will provide

1215
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:44,000
light refreshments to follow.

1216
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:50,480
Again remind you that all Sahaja Yoga programs

1217
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:54,160
are completely free.

1218
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:59,320
There, if you have any questions you want to ask about that

1219
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:02,440
there's two phone numbers here that

1220
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:04,560
will tell you where to ring.

1221
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:06,760
It really tells you everything you want to know

1222
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:08,800
and you can pick up one of these up

1223
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:10,080
as you go out the door.

1224
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:12,760
Now they've got a big supply there.

1225
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:26,120
One other thing, if is anybody here

1226
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,720
who - as soon as Shri Mataji's left -

1227
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:32,320
if there's anybody here who has not felt anything tonight,

1228
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:34,080
I would like to try.

1229
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:38,120
There's probably a very good reasons, as we explained to you earlier.

1230
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:41,880
You have these centers - you can also have blocked centers -

1231
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:45,520
they may be quite easily to clear, might be quite easy to clear and then

1232
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:47,000
[unclear].

1233
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:48,720
Before you leave here tonight

1234
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:50,840
if are any of you didn't feel anything

1235
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:54,960
we'll do our best to make sure you do.

1236
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,600
Thank you.

1237
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:22,760
We're having first series of seven follow up programs

1238
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:25,920
at Gorman House.
