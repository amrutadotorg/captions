00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.160
This Spirit when it manifests, it also gives you a state

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.800
which we call as collective consciousness.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.350
Is the state by which you become you, again I say become

00:00:16.457 --> 00:00:18.920
- it's actualization, it is not just talking -

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.360
you become conscious collective,

00:00:21.493 --> 00:00:22.653
means you become

00:00:22.852 --> 00:00:26.253
conscious of another person's centers on your fingertips.

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:29.173
You also become Self aware,

00:00:29.413 --> 00:00:30.813
you know about yourself,

00:00:30.973 --> 00:00:33.853
what centers are catching, where are we going.

00:00:34.053 --> 00:00:39.293
Like a person who becomes mentally upset, he doesn’t know,

00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:40.653
really becomes mad,

00:00:40.852 --> 00:00:43.893
goes to lunatic asylum and dies, he does not know.

00:00:44.093 --> 00:00:46.852
But in Sahaja Yoga immediately you can find out

00:00:47.013 --> 00:00:50.173
that there’s something going wrong with your mental side.

00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.613
If a person gets into cancer,

00:00:52.813 --> 00:00:57.852
he might get, gets into the state of galloping cancer, about to die,

00:00:58.013 --> 00:01:00.053
then he may discover that he has got cancer.

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:02.613
But in Sahaja Yoga if there’s a little imbalance,

00:01:02.813 --> 00:01:06.533
immediately it shows on your fingertips, and if you know

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:12.173
how to do it, how to correct it, then every problem is solved.

00:01:12.493 --> 00:01:16.013
So as I told you yesterday, yoga has double meaning.

00:01:16.213 --> 00:01:19.253
Yoga means union with the Divine, that’s one.

00:01:19.493 --> 00:01:22.933
and the second one is the expertise, the depthness,

00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:24.933
what we call in Sanskrit kaushalam.

00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.813
You must have a depthness,

00:01:26.894 --> 00:01:30.334
how to handle this all-pervading Power that is flowing through us,

00:01:30.613 --> 00:01:33.933
how to understand ourselves, how to understand others,

00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:38.053
that’s an important part of Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:38.253 --> 00:01:41.773
First of al a little light is enlightened.

00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:44.813
You get the experience of the Spirit to begin with.

00:01:44.973 --> 00:01:46.693
It's an actualization.

00:01:46.852 --> 00:01:49.413
But then you must make it grow.

00:01:49.613 --> 00:01:52.213
Christ has given beautiful parables

00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:55.093
explaining this, the sprouting of the seeds,

00:01:55.293 --> 00:01:57.693
which were thrown on the rocks,

00:01:57.852 --> 00:02:02.013
some were thrown in the good soil and somewhere neglected.

00:02:02.213 --> 00:02:04.733
And we find that everyday happening.

00:02:04.893 --> 00:02:07.693
Thousands come to My program and then I find

00:02:07.852 --> 00:02:09.852
some of them are lost in the rocks,

00:02:10.013 --> 00:02:11.933
some of them are wasted,

00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:14.693
but some of them become huge big trees

00:02:14.852 --> 00:02:18.053
to give shade, joy and support to others.

00:02:18.253 --> 00:02:19.973
We have to change this world.

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:23.053
How are we going to change this world, this horrible world

00:02:23.253 --> 00:02:27.013
which is just under precipices of destruction?

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:30.053
The only way is that we have to change ourselves.

00:02:30.253 --> 00:02:33.253
That’s the transformation just waiting to happen.

00:02:33.334 --> 00:02:35.412
It's nothing that I am doing about you,

00:02:35.493 --> 00:02:37.813
I really tell you, I don’t do anything.

00:02:37.973 --> 00:02:41.333
I don’t do anything, I’m just waiting to get it.

00:02:41.573 --> 00:02:43.613
You just catch upon it and you get it.

00:02:43.813 --> 00:02:47.173
I’m maybe just triggering it, but you can trigger it also.

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:51.613
So one has to understand that you have to be honest to yourself,

00:02:51.813 --> 00:02:53.493
you have to be fair to yourself.

00:02:53.693 --> 00:02:56.613
You have to understand your value, you must know your worth,

00:02:56.813 --> 00:02:58.852
that you are a human being created

00:02:59.013 --> 00:03:02.253
out of small things like amoeba, from carbon,

00:03:02.493 --> 00:03:04.773
and today you are sitting here as human beings,

00:03:04.933 --> 00:03:06.933
you must be something very special.

00:03:07.133 --> 00:03:10.013
And this special thing has to become that thing

00:03:10.213 --> 00:03:12.813
which will make you understand what you are.

00:03:12.973 --> 00:03:15.013
Only thing you are not yet connected.

00:03:15.213 --> 00:03:19.973
Only thing is that you have not yet felt that divinity within you.

00:03:20.173 --> 00:03:22.653
We are all potentially divine.

00:03:22.852 --> 00:03:25.173
We have to just feel that divinity within us.

00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:29.413
But as a result of that, you are such a powerful personality,

00:03:29.613 --> 00:03:31.253
power of love.

00:03:31.493 --> 00:03:34.453
We have never used the power of love,

00:03:34.653 --> 00:03:37.333
We have only used the power of hatred so far.

00:03:37.573 --> 00:03:40.893
Power of love is much above power of hatred.

00:03:41.093 --> 00:03:45.413
It can angle all hatred, can just

00:03:45.613 --> 00:03:48.013
suck in everything that is hatred.

00:03:48.213 --> 00:03:51.573
It’s very simple. Very simple methods are to be put,

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:54.693
only you must have desire to get transformed.

00:03:55.813 --> 00:03:59.213
Now the third thing that happens with Self Realization

00:03:59.533 --> 00:04:06.293
is that you get a state of peace, of bliss and of joy.

00:04:07.852 --> 00:04:11.773
When the Kundalini rises above this Agnya chakra

00:04:11.933 --> 00:04:14.613
you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:04:14.813 --> 00:04:18.173
It's called as Nirvichara Samadhi. Thoughtlessly aware,

00:04:18.333 --> 00:04:20.413
when there is no thought in your mind.

00:04:20.613 --> 00:04:22.253
If you want, you can think.

00:04:22.493 --> 00:04:24.813
If you want you can think, but if you don’t want,

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:27.533
you can be in that state when you don’t think.

00:04:27.733 --> 00:04:29.493
Actually it’s maddening sometimes

00:04:29.693 --> 00:04:33.333
the way man is thinking morning till evening,

00:04:33.573 --> 00:04:37.453
yarns after yarns, useless things, a joyless pursuit.

00:04:37.653 --> 00:04:41.852
But when this thinking stops, you are above the thoughts.

00:04:42.253 --> 00:04:45.493
I would say to give it a similitude,

00:04:45.693 --> 00:04:49.133
that the waves of thought come and go away.

00:04:49.493 --> 00:04:51.733
Another thought comes and goes away.

00:04:51.893 --> 00:04:55.853
We are jumping on the cusp of the thought all the time

00:04:56.053 --> 00:05:02.053
Supposing we can just get

00:05:02.253 --> 00:05:06.173
in the center of the thought,

00:05:06.333 --> 00:05:08.693
that is the present.

00:05:08.852 --> 00:05:12.733
If we can, could stop at the present moment,

00:05:12.893 --> 00:05:14.933
then we are not worried about the thoughts.

00:05:15.133 --> 00:05:17.773
Like the waves of water, if you are in the waves,

00:05:17.933 --> 00:05:19.573
you are frightened of that.

00:05:19.773 --> 00:05:21.693
But supposing you are in a boat

00:05:21.853 --> 00:05:25.493
then you can see the waves and enjoy them.

00:05:25.693 --> 00:05:27.933
In the same way what happens to you

00:05:28.133 --> 00:05:34.533
that you jump up to a higher state of existence

00:05:34.733 --> 00:05:39.173
through which you see the thoughts

00:05:39.573 --> 00:05:42.853
if you want, you don’t want to see you can, you need not see.

00:05:43.053 --> 00:05:48.293
Now the thoughts that you see also, are very wide and deeper

00:05:48.533 --> 00:05:50.453
where you get inspirations.

00:05:50.653 --> 00:05:53.453
That’s why, as Dr. Warren has told you,

00:05:53.653 --> 00:05:56.253
that your creativity improves.

00:05:56.493 --> 00:05:59.813
You can become tremendously dynamic.

00:05:59.973 --> 00:06:02.493
Because your time is not wasted in wasteful things.

00:06:02.693 --> 00:06:04.813
You just know this is it.

00:06:04.973 --> 00:06:08.013
This is the exact, this is what we have to do.

00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:10.973
And that’s how people get rid of

00:06:11.173 --> 00:06:14.013
many of their problems of mental tensions.

00:06:14.213 --> 00:06:17.693
There’s no tension at all. You don’t have any worries.

00:06:17.853 --> 00:06:20.853
You just see the thing like the witness.

00:06:21.053 --> 00:06:23.693
You become the witness of the whole drama.

00:06:23.852 --> 00:06:25.093
When you are in the drama,

00:06:25.293 --> 00:06:27.693
you think you are a part and parcel of the drama

00:06:27.853 --> 00:06:30.013
sometimes you weep with it and cry with it.

00:06:30.213 --> 00:06:33.453
But when the drama is over, you realize it was just a drama.

00:06:33.653 --> 00:06:34.733
“I was not there”.

00:06:34.893 --> 00:06:36.653
In the same way it happens to you,

00:06:36.852 --> 00:06:38.973
that you achieve a witness state.

00:06:39.173 --> 00:06:43.133
It happens to you. Even if you want to get involved, you cannot.

00:06:43.333 --> 00:06:44.773
You just cannot get it.

00:06:44.933 --> 00:06:46.933
That’s how you can solve the problems better

00:06:47.133 --> 00:06:48.973
because you are away from the problems.

00:06:49.173 --> 00:06:51.852
You can see what the problem is, but when you are in it,

00:06:52.013 --> 00:06:55.973
you are upset, full of tension, worries,

00:06:56.173 --> 00:06:59.573
and sometimes people get so upset with it

00:06:59.773 --> 00:07:02.573
that they commit suicides, when they find no solution.

00:07:02.773 --> 00:07:04.533
But if you are away from it,

00:07:04.733 --> 00:07:08.173
then you can definitely solve the problem.

00:07:08.893 --> 00:07:11.613
Now this witness state has to grow within you

00:07:11.813 --> 00:07:16.733
gradually, with little understanding and with little meditation,

00:07:16.893 --> 00:07:20.013
which is very simple, which you can do very easily.

00:07:20.094 --> 00:07:22.174
Nothing has to be done about.

00:07:22.533 --> 00:07:25.253
But first thing you must know, it is actualization,

00:07:25.493 --> 00:07:28.813
it is not your mental projection that is going to do anything.

00:07:28.973 --> 00:07:32.973
Like we may say, "we are all brothers and sisters". We say so.

00:07:33.773 --> 00:07:36.613
But when it comes to wars, we become enemies.

00:07:36.813 --> 00:07:39.693
Even in a family there are brothers and sisters,

00:07:39.852 --> 00:07:42.333
when it comes to property, they fight.

00:07:42.414 --> 00:07:46.248
Not in Sahaja Yoga. You really become part and parcel of each other.
