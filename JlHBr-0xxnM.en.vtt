00:04.000 --> 00:09.160
This Spirit when it manifests, it also gives you a state

00:09.360 --> 00:11.800
which we call as collective consciousness.

00:12.040 --> 00:16.350
Is the state by which you become you, again I say become

00:16.457 --> 00:18.920
- it's actualization, it is not just talking -

00:19.080 --> 00:21.360
you become conscious collective,

00:21.493 --> 00:22.653
means you become

00:22.852 --> 00:26.253
conscious of another person's centers on your fingertips.

00:26.493 --> 00:29.173
You also become Self aware,

00:29.413 --> 00:30.813
you know about yourself,

00:30.973 --> 00:33.853
what centers are catching, where are we going.

00:34.053 --> 00:39.293
Like a person who becomes mentally upset, he doesn’t know,

00:39.533 --> 00:40.653
really becomes mad,

00:40.852 --> 00:43.893
goes to lunatic asylum and dies, he does not know.

00:44.093 --> 00:46.852
But in Sahaja Yoga immediately you can find out

00:47.013 --> 00:50.173
that there’s something going wrong with your mental side.

00:50.733 --> 00:52.613
If a person gets into cancer,

00:52.813 --> 00:57.852
he might get, gets into the state of galloping cancer, about to die,

00:58.013 --> 01:00.053
then he may discover that he has got cancer.

01:00.333 --> 01:02.613
But in Sahaja Yoga if there’s a little imbalance,

01:02.813 --> 01:06.533
immediately it shows on your fingertips, and if you know

01:06.733 --> 01:12.173
how to do it, how to correct it, then every problem is solved.

01:12.493 --> 01:16.013
So as I told you yesterday, yoga has double meaning.

01:16.213 --> 01:19.253
Yoga means union with the Divine, that’s one.

01:19.493 --> 01:22.933
and the second one is the expertise, the depthness,

01:23.133 --> 01:24.933
what we call in Sanskrit kaushalam.

01:25.133 --> 01:26.813
You must have a depthness,

01:26.894 --> 01:30.334
how to handle this all-pervading Power that is flowing through us,

01:30.613 --> 01:33.933
how to understand ourselves, how to understand others,

01:34.133 --> 01:38.053
that’s an important part of Sahaja Yoga.

01:38.253 --> 01:41.773
First of al a little light is enlightened.

01:41.933 --> 01:44.813
You get the experience of the Spirit to begin with.

01:44.973 --> 01:46.693
It's an actualization.

01:46.852 --> 01:49.413
But then you must make it grow.

01:49.613 --> 01:52.213
Christ has given beautiful parables

01:52.533 --> 01:55.093
explaining this, the sprouting of the seeds,

01:55.293 --> 01:57.693
which were thrown on the rocks,

01:57.852 --> 02:02.013
some were thrown in the good soil and somewhere neglected.

02:02.213 --> 02:04.733
And we find that everyday happening.

02:04.893 --> 02:07.693
Thousands come to My program and then I find

02:07.852 --> 02:09.852
some of them are lost in the rocks,

02:10.013 --> 02:11.933
some of them are wasted,

02:12.133 --> 02:14.693
but some of them become huge big trees

02:14.852 --> 02:18.053
to give shade, joy and support to others.

02:18.253 --> 02:19.973
We have to change this world.

02:20.173 --> 02:23.053
How are we going to change this world, this horrible world

02:23.253 --> 02:27.013
which is just under precipices of destruction?

02:27.213 --> 02:30.053
The only way is that we have to change ourselves.

02:30.253 --> 02:33.253
That’s the transformation just waiting to happen.

02:33.334 --> 02:35.412
It's nothing that I am doing about you,

02:35.493 --> 02:37.813
I really tell you, I don’t do anything.

02:37.973 --> 02:41.333
I don’t do anything, I’m just waiting to get it.

02:41.573 --> 02:43.613
You just catch upon it and you get it.

02:43.813 --> 02:47.173
I’m maybe just triggering it, but you can trigger it also.

02:47.333 --> 02:51.613
So one has to understand that you have to be honest to yourself,

02:51.813 --> 02:53.493
you have to be fair to yourself.

02:53.693 --> 02:56.613
You have to understand your value, you must know your worth,

02:56.813 --> 02:58.852
that you are a human being created

02:59.013 --> 03:02.253
out of small things like amoeba, from carbon,

03:02.493 --> 03:04.773
and today you are sitting here as human beings,

03:04.933 --> 03:06.933
you must be something very special.

03:07.133 --> 03:10.013
And this special thing has to become that thing

03:10.213 --> 03:12.813
which will make you understand what you are.

03:12.973 --> 03:15.013
Only thing you are not yet connected.

03:15.213 --> 03:19.973
Only thing is that you have not yet felt that divinity within you.

03:20.173 --> 03:22.653
We are all potentially divine.

03:22.852 --> 03:25.173
We have to just feel that divinity within us.

03:25.333 --> 03:29.413
But as a result of that, you are such a powerful personality,

03:29.613 --> 03:31.253
power of love.

03:31.493 --> 03:34.453
We have never used the power of love,

03:34.653 --> 03:37.333
We have only used the power of hatred so far.

03:37.573 --> 03:40.893
Power of love is much above power of hatred.

03:41.093 --> 03:45.413
It can angle all hatred, can just

03:45.613 --> 03:48.013
suck in everything that is hatred.

03:48.213 --> 03:51.573
It’s very simple. Very simple methods are to be put,

03:51.773 --> 03:54.693
only you must have desire to get transformed.

03:55.813 --> 03:59.213
Now the third thing that happens with Self Realization

03:59.533 --> 04:06.293
is that you get a state of peace, of bliss and of joy.

04:07.852 --> 04:11.773
When the Kundalini rises above this Agnya chakra

04:11.933 --> 04:14.613
you become thoughtlessly aware.

04:14.813 --> 04:18.173
It's called as Nirvichara Samadhi. Thoughtlessly aware,

04:18.333 --> 04:20.413
when there is no thought in your mind.

04:20.613 --> 04:22.253
If you want, you can think.

04:22.493 --> 04:24.813
If you want you can think, but if you don’t want,

04:24.973 --> 04:27.533
you can be in that state when you don’t think.

04:27.733 --> 04:29.493
Actually it’s maddening sometimes

04:29.693 --> 04:33.333
the way man is thinking morning till evening,

04:33.573 --> 04:37.453
yarns after yarns, useless things, a joyless pursuit.

04:37.653 --> 04:41.852
But when this thinking stops, you are above the thoughts.

04:42.253 --> 04:45.493
I would say to give it a similitude,

04:45.693 --> 04:49.133
that the waves of thought come and go away.

04:49.493 --> 04:51.733
Another thought comes and goes away.

04:51.893 --> 04:55.853
We are jumping on the cusp of the thought all the time

04:56.053 --> 05:02.053
Supposing we can just get

05:02.253 --> 05:06.173
in the center of the thought,

05:06.333 --> 05:08.693
that is the present.

05:08.852 --> 05:12.733
If we can, could stop at the present moment,

05:12.893 --> 05:14.933
then we are not worried about the thoughts.

05:15.133 --> 05:17.773
Like the waves of water, if you are in the waves,

05:17.933 --> 05:19.573
you are frightened of that.

05:19.773 --> 05:21.693
But supposing you are in a boat

05:21.853 --> 05:25.493
then you can see the waves and enjoy them.

05:25.693 --> 05:27.933
In the same way what happens to you

05:28.133 --> 05:34.533
that you jump up to a higher state of existence

05:34.733 --> 05:39.173
through which you see the thoughts

05:39.573 --> 05:42.853
if you want, you don’t want to see you can, you need not see.

05:43.053 --> 05:48.293
Now the thoughts that you see also, are very wide and deeper

05:48.533 --> 05:50.453
where you get inspirations.

05:50.653 --> 05:53.453
That’s why, as Dr. Warren has told you,

05:53.653 --> 05:56.253
that your creativity improves.

05:56.493 --> 05:59.813
You can become tremendously dynamic.

05:59.973 --> 06:02.493
Because your time is not wasted in wasteful things.

06:02.693 --> 06:04.813
You just know this is it.

06:04.973 --> 06:08.013
This is the exact, this is what we have to do.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.973
And that’s how people get rid of

06:11.173 --> 06:14.013
many of their problems of mental tensions.

06:14.213 --> 06:17.693
There’s no tension at all. You don’t have any worries.

06:17.853 --> 06:20.853
You just see the thing like the witness.

06:21.053 --> 06:23.693
You become the witness of the whole drama.

06:23.852 --> 06:25.093
When you are in the drama,

06:25.293 --> 06:27.693
you think you are a part and parcel of the drama

06:27.853 --> 06:30.013
sometimes you weep with it and cry with it.

06:30.213 --> 06:33.453
But when the drama is over, you realize it was just a drama.

06:33.653 --> 06:34.733
“I was not there”.

06:34.893 --> 06:36.653
In the same way it happens to you,

06:36.852 --> 06:38.973
that you achieve a witness state.

06:39.173 --> 06:43.133
It happens to you. Even if you want to get involved, you cannot.

06:43.333 --> 06:44.773
You just cannot get it.

06:44.933 --> 06:46.933
That’s how you can solve the problems better

06:47.133 --> 06:48.973
because you are away from the problems.

06:49.173 --> 06:51.852
You can see what the problem is, but when you are in it,

06:52.013 --> 06:55.973
you are upset, full of tension, worries,

06:56.173 --> 06:59.573
and sometimes people get so upset with it

06:59.773 --> 07:02.573
that they commit suicides, when they find no solution.

07:02.773 --> 07:04.533
But if you are away from it,

07:04.733 --> 07:08.173
then you can definitely solve the problem.

07:08.893 --> 07:11.613
Now this witness state has to grow within you

07:11.813 --> 07:16.733
gradually, with little understanding and with little meditation,

07:16.893 --> 07:20.013
which is very simple, which you can do very easily.

07:20.094 --> 07:22.174
Nothing has to be done about.

07:22.533 --> 07:25.253
But first thing you must know, it is actualization,

07:25.493 --> 07:28.813
it is not your mental projection that is going to do anything.

07:28.973 --> 07:32.973
Like we may say, "we are all brothers and sisters". We say so.

07:33.773 --> 07:36.613
But when it comes to wars, we become enemies.

07:36.813 --> 07:39.693
Even in a family there are brothers and sisters,

07:39.852 --> 07:42.333
when it comes to property, they fight.

07:42.414 --> 07:46.248
Not in Sahaja Yoga. You really become part and parcel of each other.
