00:06.924 --> 00:10.801
And Sahaja Yoga is the place where you have to learn,

00:10.881 --> 00:17.173
in every way. For Indians have to learn how to be honest

00:20.173 --> 00:23.572
and English have to learn how to love.

00:23.652 --> 00:28.363
Americans have to learn how to be self-respecting.

00:29.729 --> 00:34.520
All of us have to learn, give up what we had, our identifications,

00:34.600 --> 00:38.739
and have to become subtler and universal

00:38.819 --> 00:43.872
and people of such values that anybody who sees will say

00:43.952 --> 00:49.775
that in America Mother has created Abraham Lincolns,

00:51.152 --> 00:56.757
in Russia Tolstoys, in Maharashtra Shivajis.

00:59.297 --> 01:03.265
I’m too ambitious, I should say,

01:04.464 --> 01:09.153
but I see reality in you and reality in Myself.

01:09.233 --> 01:13.476
On that basis, I say, one has to create

01:13.556 --> 01:18.236
people of that special quality which they have sterling qualities,

01:18.316 --> 01:23.000
sterling qualities, spiritual qualities

01:23.080 --> 01:26.935
which are so subtle, so beautiful,

01:27.015 --> 01:29.876
so sweet, so understanding.

01:29.956 --> 01:32.727
And still, just like steel,

01:32.807 --> 01:40.720
nobody can budge them from their own principles, tatwas.

01:43.228 --> 01:46.987
That is what it is, so simple as that.

01:47.067 --> 01:51.426
And then you start enjoying your love, enjoying your virtues,

01:51.506 --> 01:57.406
enjoying everything and having compassion for others.

01:57.486 --> 01:59.516
Then you don’t catch;

01:59.596 --> 02:03.878
you catch because you don’t have compassion.

02:03.958 --> 02:07.091
In compassion you’ll never catch, never.

02:07.171 --> 02:09.491
A mother never gets a disease from her child.

02:09.571 --> 02:14.638
She never gets a disease from her child, it’s a fact.

02:17.673 --> 02:22.931
Child may be a tuberculosis patient or could be any patient,

02:23.011 --> 02:30.527
she never catches because she loves.

02:32.014 --> 02:35.769
In the same way, when you really love,

02:35.849 --> 02:37.250
you’ll never catch anything.

02:37.330 --> 02:39.591
Then what is the question of what is to clear,

02:39.671 --> 02:42.201
where to clear, what to do – what does it matter?

02:42.281 --> 02:44.241
You are just flowing your heart.

02:44.321 --> 02:47.866
At this moment, My children, My Sahaja yogis

02:47.946 --> 02:53.708
are at that level that they can completely open their heart

02:53.788 --> 02:58.144
without any fear.

03:00.409 --> 03:02.499
It’s a very different stage you have reached now;

03:02.579 --> 03:06.295
you are at a different stage. Just assume your powers.

03:06.375 --> 03:13.544
Know that you are that. Just open your heart.

03:13.624 --> 03:17.136
Like, the other day I saw somebody, he was caught up very badly

03:17.216 --> 03:19.577
from all the sides – not Sahaja yogi, somebody else.

03:19.657 --> 03:20.758
And I asked him,

03:20.838 --> 03:25.158
“How did you manage to get so many bhoots into yourself?”

03:25.238 --> 03:28.364
Every, every guru you name, he is there.

03:28.444 --> 03:29.850
I said, “How did you manage?”

03:29.930 --> 03:34.227
He said, “I have a very open heart.”

03:34.895 --> 03:37.425
“Oh God,” I said.

03:39.479 --> 03:42.810
I said, “It’s like an open window in a dirty place.

03:42.890 --> 03:49.429
You get every smell, every mosquitoes and bugs walking into it.”

03:54.907 --> 03:59.179
So, the fear of opening your heart to that extent,

03:59.259 --> 04:02.944
comes from that, from that experience.

04:03.024 --> 04:09.594
But now, you are at such a stage that, open your heart.

04:11.162 --> 04:16.412
There should be no fear; there will be no problem,

04:16.492 --> 04:21.139
material problems are not difficult to be solved.

04:21.219 --> 04:27.191
Like, somebody was taking My photograph

04:27.271 --> 04:30.165
which was in a silver frame,

04:30.245 --> 04:33.160
and she was rather worried because the customs may stop her

04:33.240 --> 04:36.782
not taking. Of course, photograph they can’t stop,

04:36.862 --> 04:41.588
but maybe the silver frame.

04:41.668 --> 04:48.522
And this gentleman told Me that he was taking it

04:48.602 --> 04:52.570
with him with a frame, silver frame and he thought people will object.

04:52.650 --> 04:54.900
But as soon as they saw the photograph

04:54.980 --> 04:59.613
they said namaskar to the photograph, forgot about the frame.

05:06.728 --> 05:09.919
So many problems can be solved,

05:09.999 --> 05:17.359
material problems – is so simple to be solved, so simple.

05:19.407 --> 05:24.350
Is the easiest to be solved, physical problems also.

05:24.430 --> 05:26.884
I have known of some Sahaja yogis

05:26.964 --> 05:29.427
who have been in Sahaja Yoga six, seven years.

05:29.507 --> 05:31.787
But still they are frightened about their body,

05:31.867 --> 05:35.353
their physical body, the troubles they have had

05:35.433 --> 05:38.740
and this and that. If they can just leave that fear,

05:38.820 --> 05:40.574
they’ll get out of it.

05:40.654 --> 05:44.014
It is such a vicious circle built in.

05:44.094 --> 05:47.430
And the same thing works out with our open heart

05:47.510 --> 05:49.474
surgery as we call it.

05:49.554 --> 05:52.574
We are afraid that our heart will be again

05:52.654 --> 05:54.446
caught up into nonsensical things,

05:54.526 --> 05:57.156
so we don’t want to open our heart.

05:57.236 --> 05:58.957
That fear I can understand.

05:59.037 --> 06:02.774
But now you are Sahaja yogis, finished.

06:03.115 --> 06:07.619
Ask all these people to get lost.

06:07.699 --> 06:13.192
All these fears, you should ask them to get lost.

06:15.651 --> 06:20.801
When you discover that you are the Spirit,

06:20.881 --> 06:25.816
you are that powerful Spirit, just try to steady.

06:25.896 --> 06:30.943
How it feels happy. It’s very simple.

06:31.023 --> 06:34.965
When do you feel really happy? Is when you give something,

06:35.045 --> 06:38.337
not to Mataji only. To Me you are, I know.

06:38.417 --> 06:43.552
If I take something from you, you will feel very happy about it,

06:43.632 --> 06:50.856
I know. But to somebody else; give some love, comfort.

06:50.936 --> 07:00.255
What a great power this voice and this vani has,

07:00.335 --> 07:06.227
that you can comfort others by saying good things.

07:06.307 --> 07:09.654
Can you imagine what a power God has given you?

07:09.734 --> 07:15.258
Without spending a single pi, you can comfort others,

07:15.338 --> 07:19.212
only by saying good things. If you say a vmantra,

07:19.292 --> 07:22.220
you’ll comfort them more in a subtle way.

07:22.300 --> 07:29.968
If you instill love of God within them, it is even greater.

07:30.048 --> 07:40.375
And the joy of that is so much because the Spirit is joy.

07:40.455 --> 07:44.674
The more you open it out, the more light comes in,

07:44.754 --> 07:51.305
more it works out. So give up that fear

07:51.385 --> 07:55.011
which is placed within you in your experiences.

07:55.091 --> 07:58.905
Now, this is a new experience of a new life,

07:58.985 --> 08:04.168
where your energy comes from the Spirit, which is love.

08:04.248 --> 08:06.320
In one word it is love.

08:06.400 --> 08:14.817
And in three words, it is truth, it is attention and it is joy.

08:14.897 --> 08:17.607
All put together it is love.

08:17.687 --> 08:23.579
When you mix them up, it becomes love.

08:23.659 --> 08:29.165
And that is what you have – it’s the great power of love.

08:29.245 --> 08:31.933
Through your attention you love others,

08:32.013 --> 08:35.198
even attention is sufficient.

08:35.278 --> 08:38.654
To be attentive…. see, I needed a handkerchief

08:38.734 --> 08:44.123
All right, that’s true. I needed a handkerchief. I forgot.

08:44.203 --> 08:47.823
I mean, usually I forget all these things.

08:47.903 --> 08:53.766
Then they felt the need, “Mother needs just a handkerchief.”

08:53.846 --> 08:56.032
They brought the handkerchief;

08:56.112 --> 09:05.564
a very simple action, you know, but the attention is on Me.

09:05.644 --> 09:11.500
With little things like handkerchief you can comfort people.

09:11.580 --> 09:14.374
For a Sahaja yogi, even to give a handkerchief itself

09:14.454 --> 09:18.294
is so vibrated, itself.

09:18.374 --> 09:22.763
To win over other people is also this way:

09:22.843 --> 09:28.283
to be kind to them, to give them.

09:28.363 --> 09:33.563
But to give them realization is the highest thing.

09:36.156 --> 09:38.808
Now, when you become subtler and subtler,

09:38.888 --> 09:43.995
you will see that you will not have sympathies with people

09:44.075 --> 09:47.157
who are afflicted, not sympathies,

09:47.237 --> 09:51.487
but you will have love for them.

09:51.567 --> 09:57.168
There is a big difference between sympathy and love.

09:57.248 --> 10:02.698
When you have sympathy means what? You share pathos.

10:02.778 --> 10:06.400
Pathos. If you want to share pathos, share.

10:06.480 --> 10:10.913
Very good idea is to share pathos.

10:10.993 --> 10:17.260
But if you want to share joy,

10:17.340 --> 10:20.861
you will not have sympathy, you’ll have love.

10:20.941 --> 10:24.894
You want to share your joy of your Spirit with another person,

10:24.974 --> 10:27.782
so you may talk to that person in a way

10:27.862 --> 10:32.111
that may not look so much pleasing and falling at his feet,

10:32.191 --> 10:33.993
and – you see, this is the work of politicians

10:34.073 --> 10:37.482
or business people, not yours.

10:37.722 --> 10:39.868
You are not seeking any business out of them;

10:39.948 --> 10:43.169
you want them to come to realization.

10:43.249 --> 10:51.398
So, you have to say things which are wrong very firmly.

10:51.478 --> 10:53.788
With a real firm hand you have to say,

10:53.868 --> 10:57.375
“This is absolutely wrong, absurd.”

10:57.455 --> 10:59.228
You have to convince on that point,

10:59.308 --> 11:01.934
on that if you go on saying, like this, like that,

11:02.014 --> 11:03.717
it will never go into their heads because they are bhoots

11:03.797 --> 11:09.974
and you have to hit them hard. That is also love.

11:10.054 --> 11:18.755
So, love is the strongest thing and the sweetest thing.

11:18.835 --> 11:22.084
Is such a beautiful combination

11:22.164 --> 11:26.462
and the one who has the wisdom, that subtler wisdom,

11:26.542 --> 11:30.857
can only achieve it. Now again the mind will work,

11:30.937 --> 11:33.000
“How to do it?”

11:33.080 --> 11:40.361
So, I think all of you should put this word “how” into the sea.

11:43.290 --> 11:46.547
There is another very good word in English language,

11:46.627 --> 11:48.980
which you should use: “why not!”

11:56.190 --> 12:02.421
That’s the way you can assure yourself, ascertain yourself,

12:02.501 --> 12:10.084
work it out that way into complete blessing of God.

12:10.164 --> 12:13.532
You have to just pass those blessings to others,

12:13.612 --> 12:18.217
that’s all. Nothing more is to be done,

12:18.297 --> 12:22.304
just pass that light to others.

12:22.384 --> 12:25.092
For that, what you need

12:25.172 --> 12:33.258
is a man who has accepted love as his career,

12:33.338 --> 12:36.396
a man who worships love,

12:36.476 --> 12:43.178
a person who thinks love is above all.
