00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.640
For Sahaja Yogis now is very easy to find out if something is real or unreal, if it

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.999
is truth or untruth, it is love or hatred.

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:21.480
Only through vibrations you can do.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.920
But going beyond that, I may say,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.880
beyond that one has to know what are these vibrations

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:33.800
and what are they made of.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.999
What is the subtle force which is behind those vibrations.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.480
We call it Paramchaitanya, alright. Paramchaitanya, so what.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.680
What happens to you when you get Paramchaitanya,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.200
is something to be understood, the subtleties.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.200
As I said, we are made of five elements, alright?

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.999
So when you get your awakening, when
the Kundalini reaches Sahasrara

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:19.999
and opens out your fontanel bone area,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.400
you become one with the Divine power,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.560
then this Divine power itself starts
flowing through you.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.999
A connection is established.

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:35.400
Now when it starts flowing through you,

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.480
this Shakti starts flowing through you, then what happens?

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.999
The subtle part we should understand.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.999
The subtle part is like this, that
these five elements, we are made of,

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:57.680
these vibrations gradually start breaking into

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.200
the subtler form of which they are made.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.960
So the first thing such a person has is the breaks, you see,

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:12.999
as it is said that "Word is God."

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.240
It's said also in the Bible, "The Word is God."

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.400
Now what is this Word?

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.920
Word is a silent, we can say,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.320
silent commandment. We can call it like that.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.840
But from that Word comes, according to Indian Philosophy,

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.840
is another thing that we call as "Bindu"...

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.760
or we can say if Word becomes Naad, is a sound...

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:57.520
and then it becomes the Bindu means one small dot,

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.400
and then from this dot...

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.999
you see, all these five elements start
coming one after another.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.360
The first element that comes out is light...

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.840
"Tej" light ... is the first element that comes out.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.560
So the essence of the first element is light.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.560
We call it Tej, Tejas.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.160
It is written, of course, in Sanskrit

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.999
but we should understand that how the light pervades

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.999
Sahaja Yoga so much and you see the light everywhere.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.440
So the first element which is light and

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:59.280
you can say in English the light's subtle thing is,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.920
we can say, "enlightenment", you can say.

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:12.240
But enlightenment has another meaning, so we can say it is Tej, Tej.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.520
For example a person who gets realization

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.640
has a face which is very radiant, so you can say the "radiance".

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.280
The radiance is the subtlety of the light.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.999
So this radiance starts showing on your face.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.800
Radiance starts expressing itself

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.520
and with that radiance people get impressed

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.999
and they start thinking something special about

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
this personality which has a radiance.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.120
Now you have seen my photographs also wherever they are,

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.720
many a times you find lots of light around.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:02.999
That is nothing but the light in me is giving radiance

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:05.960
because the light becomes subtler.

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:09.360
When the light becomes subtle in me, -- light,

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.440
light is one of the elements -- when it becomes subtler

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.999
then it gives radiance and so

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.080
this is the subtle growth within you that takes place.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.999
Your faces also start shining.

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:33.000
They too have radiance and they too have a kind of a different

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.480
complexion, I would say.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:44.520
This radiance is to be understood, is the subtle of the light

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.680
of which we are made, light in the gross manner.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:55.640
Then after this from the light comes the second thing,

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.999
which we call as Vayu in Sanskrit,

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:01.200
meaning the air.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.999
So the air that we have which is gross air,

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.999
what is subtle of air is the "cool breeze" that you get.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.720
The cool breeze is the subtle of that air.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:22.160
So the subtle of what you understand as cool breeze

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.999
is what we call vibrations, the subtle of that is air;

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:32.999
which is a part and parcel of our making.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.480
So this cool breeze

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:41.200
is the second thing that you start getting subtler and subtler.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:47.680
When your growth takes place, all these subtle things start expressing themselves.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.240
It is not only that you get vibrations

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.360
but you get the cool breeze and that is the subtler

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.360
of air that has built you up.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.800
Then comes the Water.

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:06.360
We are also made of water.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.999
What is the subtle of water is...

00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:21.840
sometimes English language, you know,
becomes little short of expressions... but

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:31.600
they call it...I mean which makes the skin, hard skin soft.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.720
The skin becomes soft.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:44.520
This is another sign of a realized soul that his...

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:51.200
there is some cream they use, isn't it, to soften the face.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:57.400
But this is the water in us, gives us that luster,

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.999
that nourishment to make our skin very soft

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.160
and that softness of the skin becomes very visible.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.640
This is the minimum of minimum, I would say.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.800
But then a person who is a realized soul

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:18.280
becomes very soft person, very delicate.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:25.999
When he talks to some body, in his voice there is warmth

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:34.560
or I should say there is... [Mother speeks Hindi]...

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:40.920
to have that flow, watery flow and coolness of the water.

00:08:40.999 --> 00:08:43.920
So that is the another subtle thing

00:08:43.999 --> 00:08:48.160
that should be expressed in your behavior, on your skin,

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.999
on your dealings with others,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.240
that you should be like the water, which is mobile,

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:02.520
which is cooling, which is soothing, which is cleansing.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:07.120
So this also becomes a part and parcel of your being,

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.999
once you become a realized soul.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.120
With this water you have also another thing

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.999
which we call it as Agni, means the fire.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.320
So you also have fire but it is a very silent fire.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:27.440
It does not burn anybody but it burns all the wrong things within you.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.999
Whatever wrong things you have it burns

00:09:29.999 --> 00:09:32.999
and it burns the wrong things in other people also.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:37.840
For example, a person comes with a great anger towards me.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:43.560
What happens that this anger becomes cooler

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.720
with the fire that is there.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:50.400
Moreover, a realized soul cannot get burnt,

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:56.440
fire cannot burn, the burning cannot come to him.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.999
It is very important to understand.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:05.960
Also if you are doing something wrong, it may burn you,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.360
but if you are a good Sahaja Yogi and
I should say, perfect Sahaja Yogi,

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.800
fire will never burn you.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.280
We have an example of Sita Ji

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.280
that she went into the fire Pariksha... nothing burnt.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.920
So this is what one has to understand,

00:10:23.999 --> 00:10:27.200
that once you get to the subtleties of the fire,

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:34.760
so the fire and the water both of them become sort of Divine.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:40.560
For example, the water which you touch, water you drink,

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:47.000
whatever you put your hand in the water, the water becomes vibrated.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.360
Means What?

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:52.920
The subtleties of the water comes in it, the coolness,

00:10:52.999 --> 00:10:57.640
curing power also comes in that water.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:02.080
So when it becomes subtler, all these powers start showing

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:07.520
which you can see for yourself.
You do not have to experiment.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:15.999
Then the lastly is the Mother Earth... is most important... is Mother Earth.

00:11:15.999 --> 00:11:21.080
There is a photograph you might see
which was taken in Russia in My Dacha

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:26.080
where the Kundalini is in the Mother Earth.
They have shown clearly.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:31.160
It is there and it is the Mother Earth which shows.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:37.280
For example, I have seen flowers, if you keep them in my room, they blossom.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.999
They can become very big like that,

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:44.360
never people have seen such big flowers, sometimes they say.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.160
I am doing nothing. I am just sitting
down and what happens to the flowers?

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:53.600
You see now there this principle of the Mother Earth works...

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.720
the subtle Mother Earth, is works, it's a mother.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.720
And that gives you all the nourishment

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:05.120
and makes you grow healthy,

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:10.560
and this is how this subtlety of the Mother Earth works.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.999
Mother Earth is the one who is giver of virtue to all these flowers

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:21.520
and to all these trees
and to all that, but it also plays a big part in us.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:27.960
It is not only the Mother Earth that exists without our connection

00:12:27.999 --> 00:12:30.360
and we do not respect the Mother Earth.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.560
We have polluted it, we have done all kinds of things,

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.080
we have removed the trees and we have made a mess out of her,

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:43.480
but she is our Mother and so many subtle things of this Mother Earth come into us.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.999
One of them is gravity.

00:12:46.999 --> 00:12:50.320
A person becomes very attractive,

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:55.600
not in the physical sense but in the spiritual sense.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.920
Such a person attracts others.

00:12:58.999 --> 00:13:06.999
They feel attrackted and they feel that something special is about this person.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.120
This is one of the qualities of the Mother Earth.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:15.999
If she had not kept us attracted we
would have fallen off with her movement

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:20.280
and also other qualities of the Mother Earth

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:24.999
start manifesting within us, and we become very,

00:13:24.999 --> 00:13:32.480
I should say, extremely tolerant, patient... person.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.880
Tolerant and patient... extremely tolerant and patient.

00:13:36.999 --> 00:13:41.400
But if you are not tolerant, if you are hot tempered and all that,

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.999
then Mother Earth's
principle is not expressed I should say.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.320
Look at the Mother Earth. How much she tolerates our nonsense,

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:53.720
how many wrong things we do against her, but still she tolerates.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.320
Sri Ganesha's quality is to tolerate, to begin with.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.000
Up to a point, he tolerates. In the same way,

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:07.040
we too become extremely tolerant, patient and forgiving.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.160
This is the minimum of minimum that should happen

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.920
to all the Sahajayogis who have vibrations,

00:14:12.999 --> 00:14:14.999
because now I have told you all the things

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.999
that are expressed in your vibrations.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.800
It is a thing to be understood that

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.480
what you have become now is something very great,

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.800
it has not happened to others,

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:32.440
it has not happened to somebody who is not being a Sahaja Yogi.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.320
You see the people who go to Church

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:39.320
or to Mosques or to Temple, see their faces.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.840
Look at them, how do they look like?

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.520
They haven't got anything from the Temple,

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.560
they haven't got anything from the Mosque,

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:53.080
they haven't got anything from any one of these places where they go to worship.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.160
So, that is artificial.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.760
That has become something, I should say,

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.480
without any connection with the reality.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.760
Only after realization you are connected with reality

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:12.600
and you can get the understanding

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.999
of all these subtleties working through you.

00:15:15.999 --> 00:15:18.800
Why I am telling you this, because I want you

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:24.520
to know and recognize yourself, to understand what you are, what you have got.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:30.240
Once you recognize yourself and understand yourself you can do a lot.
