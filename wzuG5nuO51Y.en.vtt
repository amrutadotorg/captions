00:18:20.518 --> 00:18:28.205
Now we are facing little children.

00:18:28.452 --> 00:18:36.074
They are the ones who are incarnations.

00:18:37.863 --> 00:18:43.677
They are the ones who are going
to lead humanity

00:18:43.878 --> 00:18:52.837
into some great advancement –

00:18:53.038 --> 00:18:58.796
the humanity has to be looked after.

00:18:59.002 --> 00:19:05.170
They are tomorrow’s humanity.
And we are today’s.

00:19:05.371 --> 00:19:11.859
And what are we giving to them
for them to follow?

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:17.057
What is their aim in life?

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:21.836
Very, very difficult to say.

00:19:22.037 --> 00:19:30.659
But with the Sahaja Yoga they will
all go in the proper way,

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:33.922
they’ll behave in a proper way

00:19:34.122 --> 00:19:42.773
and the whole thing will be a different
mass of Sahaja Yogis coming up.

00:19:42.974 --> 00:19:49.220
But it is the duty of bigger Sahaja Yogis
to look after them;

00:19:49.421 --> 00:19:54.730
to have better moral standards,
to have better lives

00:19:54.931 --> 00:20:04.686
so that they follow your life and become
genuinely good Sahaja Yogis.

00:20:04.887 --> 00:20:12.889
It’s a very big responsibility, perhaps
we don’t recognise it, we don’t understand,

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:24.478
but all these are little creatures
which are after the image

00:20:24.679 --> 00:20:32.226
of great souls and they should be
brought up in that way,

00:20:32.427 --> 00:20:40.241
respected in that manner and loved
with great care.

00:20:40.442 --> 00:20:48.222
This is to be understood. The problem
with our elderly people is this,

00:20:48.423 --> 00:20:54.120
that we do not consider them
to be considered,

00:20:54.350 --> 00:21:01.480
to be bothered about, to be understood
about. We think we are too intelligent,

00:21:01.681 --> 00:21:06.717
too good and we need not waste
our energy with them.

00:21:06.918 --> 00:21:10.617
This is the trouble of the elderly
people.

00:21:10.818 --> 00:21:18.277
But today when we are sitting here
to worship Shri Ganesha,

00:21:18.478 --> 00:21:22.759
we should know they are all incarnations
of Shri Ganesha

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:31.650
and they should be given proper attention,
proper understanding about themselves.

00:21:31.851 --> 00:21:41.589
I find certain amount of children who are
very well-behaved, which are very sensible,

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:47.677
and there are some who have no idea
as to what they are doing.

00:21:47.878 --> 00:21:54.083
So it is the duty of the elders to put
ideas into their head,

00:21:54.284 --> 00:22:00.115
to proper understanding about themselves
and the self-respect.

00:22:00.315 --> 00:22:06.808
Same thing I would say for the elder
Sahaja Yogis

00:22:07.008 --> 00:22:11.727
who have to look after their younger
brothers and sisters.

00:22:11.927 --> 00:22:17.765
In this family of ours which we call
as Sahaja Yogis,

00:22:17.965 --> 00:22:24.260
there are all kinds of people, all types,
all behaviours.

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:31.728
Of course, they should not be regimented,
there should not be uniformity,

00:22:31.929 --> 00:22:35.446
but in that variety there should be
with beauty,

00:22:35.646 --> 00:22:43.175
there should be beautiful trend of being
one with each other.

00:22:43.375 --> 00:22:47.950
For that, what should we do,
is the problem.

00:22:48.151 --> 00:22:52.631
What should the elders do to achieve that?

00:22:52.831 --> 00:23:00.916
What is our solid contribution
to their lives?

00:23:01.116 --> 00:23:12.907
The first will be to tell them who is
Shri Ganesha,

00:23:13.494 --> 00:23:21.286
and that what are the qualities of Ganesha,
what does He represent.

00:23:21.487 --> 00:23:27.252
What does He represent, what qualities
He has.

00:23:27.452 --> 00:23:33.490
And once they start understanding, that
though being a little boy,

00:23:33.691 --> 00:23:40.370
He’s so generous, He’s so kind,
He’s so forgiving,

00:23:40.571 --> 00:23:45.748
they’ll be amazed because they are
also small

00:23:45.949 --> 00:23:51.407
and they’ll also take to that kind of life.

00:23:51.608 --> 00:23:57.751
I find some children very sensible,
very good here.

00:23:57.951 --> 00:24:03.999
Some are naughty and some don’t understand
what we are doing here.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:08.702
Whatever it is, they are after all
children.

00:24:08.903 --> 00:24:15.213
And what you have to do is to look
after them, respect them,

00:24:15.413 --> 00:24:23.705
and give them the full idea about
Shri Ganesha.

00:24:23.944 --> 00:24:31.629
I think everybody must have a statue
of Shri Ganesha in your house,

00:24:31.829 --> 00:24:37.383
so the children will see it and ask,
“Who is He? What is He doing here?”

00:24:37.584 --> 00:24:41.603
And you’ll be amazed how they will
understand Him,

00:24:41.804 --> 00:24:47.446
how they will understand His qualities
and how they will work it out.

00:24:47.646 --> 00:24:54.928
It is important for all of you to have
at least one Shri Ganesha in your house,

00:24:55.129 --> 00:25:01.379
so that you can tell your children that,
‘You all have to become like Him’.

00:25:01.579 --> 00:25:06.089
Now what are the qualities of Shri Ganesha?

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:10.439
They won’t understand chastity,
they are too small,

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:14.105
they won’t understand all those qualities.

00:25:14.306 --> 00:25:23.894
But one quality they will understand
is to be honest. Is to be honest.

00:26:04.396 --> 00:26:13.264
Gradually you’ll find all difficult ones
will go down, it will work out that way.

00:26:13.465 --> 00:26:19.104
Because you see, they don’t understand
My lecture,

00:26:19.305 --> 00:26:22.337
they don’t understand what I am saying.

00:26:22.538 --> 00:26:30.274
But one thing is there, if there are some
oppositions within, they will show –

00:26:30.475 --> 00:26:36.559
show very well – because they are
so innocent and so simple,

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:44.989
their innocence will help them to expose
them to reality.

00:26:45.958 --> 00:26:51.818
I hope you all look after your children,
guide them properly

00:26:52.019 --> 00:27:04.911
and take them to a level of understanding
that they understand what is their position,

00:27:05.112 --> 00:27:10.569
what qualities they should have,
why will they be respected.

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:17.336
You’ll be amazed, that their behaviour
will change

00:27:17.537 --> 00:27:21.948
the behaviour of all the other children.

00:27:23.261 --> 00:27:30.153
What I have to say that nobody should think
that you are very grown-up

00:27:30.354 --> 00:27:35.564
because you can keep quiet, sit quietly
and all that, no.

00:27:35.765 --> 00:27:42.721
You are grown-up only if you can imbibe
the qualities of Shri Ganesha.

00:27:42.922 --> 00:27:49.672
I have seen people who are very grown-up
still do not have simple qualities

00:27:49.873 --> 00:27:55.043
of chastity, of honesty.

00:27:55.244 --> 00:28:02.376
They don’t have, and they can’t have,
because they don’t think it is important.

00:28:02.577 --> 00:28:11.108
So, I leave it to you to find out
Shri Ganesha within yourself.

00:28:32.532 --> 00:28:37.690
I enjoy their company because
they are so innocent

00:28:37.891 --> 00:28:46.431
and so simple-hearted and I like them
very, very much.

00:28:54.878 --> 00:29:02.898
So, you should not get afraid or frightened
of their mischief.

00:29:03.063 --> 00:29:08.739
On the contrary, you should know
they deserve much more love,

00:29:08.939 --> 00:29:15.835
much more understanding and much more
scope to grow.

00:29:16.036 --> 00:29:22.389
I hope by the time they will be of your age,
they’ll be great Sahaja Yogis.

00:29:22.589 --> 00:29:25.808
They’ll understand what we are doing here.

00:29:26.014 --> 00:29:33.395
I had to face mountains of nonsense
with the older people,

00:29:33.596 --> 00:29:40.469
but these won’t have that. They’ll be
very simple, very sweet

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:44.406
and they’ll understand love.

00:29:45.644 --> 00:29:50.020
So I would say we can allow these children
to go out and play

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:56.282
and somebody can look after them,
so that you’ll be at peace.

00:30:01.431 --> 00:30:04.529
Who can take them out?

00:30:28.731 --> 00:30:35.346
You can give Me flowers. If you have got
flowers, I’ll take them.

00:30:44.144 --> 00:30:46.623
Thank you.

00:30:47.969 --> 00:30:51.154
Thank you very much.

00:30:52.414 --> 00:30:57.594
What is it? Boy: Chocolate.
Pujari: Chocolate.

00:30:57.795 --> 00:31:00.421
Boy: Yes, chocolate.
Pujari: Chocolate. Chocolate, Shri Mataji.

00:31:00.622 --> 00:31:04.356
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:31:10.085 --> 00:31:12.697
Thank you.

00:31:55.084 --> 00:31:57.758
Thank you.

00:31:58.967 --> 00:32:01.554
Thank you.

00:32:14.955 --> 00:32:17.796
Avinash: Can we have some volunteers?
Please, take the children out.

00:32:17.997 --> 00:32:20.047
Shri Mataji would like the children
to play outside.

00:32:20.248 --> 00:32:23.951
Can we have some mothers, some aunties
if they can please take them out?

00:32:24.217 --> 00:32:27.098
So we can proceed, please.

00:32:27.516 --> 00:32:31.182
Any volunteers, anyone?

00:32:31.809 --> 00:32:34.134
If Yuva Shakti...
