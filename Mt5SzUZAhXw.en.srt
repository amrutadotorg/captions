1
00:00:00,222 --> 00:00:09,547
It is such a great pleasure to see you all
assembled here,

2
00:00:09,748 --> 00:00:20,615
and which is such a far-fetched place, away
from the madding crowd.

3
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:29,257
It's such a beautiful place, and which has
vibrations.

4
00:00:31,401 --> 00:00:35,134
They can't hear you.

5
00:00:36,346 --> 00:00:42,275
Now can you hear Me? All right.

6
00:00:44,588 --> 00:00:47,727
It's all right now.

7
00:00:50,828 --> 00:00:54,474
I selected this place suddenly

8
00:00:54,675 --> 00:01:01,322
from a very thick newspaper, American
newspaper.

9
00:01:01,522 --> 00:01:05,424
The vibrations were just shooting out

10
00:01:05,624 --> 00:01:09,152
and I said, "What is this, coming from
where?"

11
00:01:09,353 --> 00:01:12,590
And there was a little advertisement,

12
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:18,142
and I said, "This is the place where we
have to go."

13
00:01:18,343 --> 00:01:25,891
This place has so many vibrations, even
in the advertisement."

14
00:01:26,335 --> 00:01:32,687
So you can imagine how the guidance comes.

15
00:01:32,887 --> 00:01:40,535
It comes from vibrations, and that's how
I was here

16
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:48,281
and this place was selected by the divine
Force,

17
00:01:48,481 --> 00:01:52,408
and it happened only in one day.

18
00:01:52,608 --> 00:01:57,294
Such a miraculous thing to happen in one
day!

19
00:01:58,398 --> 00:02:04,560
It was taking so much time for them even
to get this,

20
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:09,698
and suddenly I told them, "Better get it."

21
00:02:10,473 --> 00:02:20,180
It all worked out, and we are now here
in the most beautiful atmosphere.

22
00:02:23,322 --> 00:02:30,253
Of course, you know that Red Indians were
driven out

23
00:02:30,453 --> 00:02:39,042
and they came here to hide themselves. They
were hiding themselves in this place

24
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:48,655
so that they should not be crushed and
destroyed forever.

25
00:02:49,512 --> 00:02:56,487
That era is over now, that era
of domination,

26
00:02:56,687 --> 00:03:02,770
of entering into somebody else's land and
occupying it,

27
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,125
and considering it to be a great revelry,

28
00:03:07,326 --> 00:03:13,870
all that is over now, the human
understanding has gone much beyond;

29
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:20,931
and they understand that this is sinful,
this is wrong,

30
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:24,496
whatever we have done was wrong.

31
00:03:24,696 --> 00:03:27,856
But those people are no more.

32
00:03:28,056 --> 00:03:33,542
And the children and the grandchildren
of those children

33
00:03:33,743 --> 00:03:38,890
of these people who were the children
of God, they used to think,

34
00:03:39,091 --> 00:03:42,539
do not like all that;

35
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:49,648
because you have no right

36
00:03:49,848 --> 00:03:57,834
to take somebody's land like that and
occupy it as your own.

37
00:03:58,546 --> 00:04:02,108
Of course, the land doesn't belong
to anyone,

38
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:08,756
but still wherever you are born, that's
your land,

39
00:04:08,956 --> 00:04:17,905
and that land has to be kept with those
who are born here, who own it.

40
00:04:18,105 --> 00:04:24,705
But this kind of aggression has been going
on for ages now.

41
00:04:24,905 --> 00:04:29,486
Now the time has come to finish this,

42
00:04:29,692 --> 00:04:34,636
once for all give up this kind
of adventure,

43
00:04:34,844 --> 00:04:43,159
is to enter into somebody's land or
somebody's house and occupy it.

44
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,930
But there's another kind of aggression
I see now,

45
00:04:47,131 --> 00:04:52,480
is that they enter into the minds
of the people now

46
00:04:52,681 --> 00:05:02,186
through their talk, through their all kinds
of aggressive attitude,

47
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:07,557
and the mind, mind itself becomes a slave.

48
00:05:07,757 --> 00:05:16,019
The present times are like that, I think,
where people have no freedom

49
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:23,936
to think what is right, what is wrong, and
also to take to right things.

50
00:05:24,137 --> 00:05:30,408
They have to accept whatever is happening
around,

51
00:05:30,932 --> 00:05:37,554
whatever is immoral, whatever is
destructive.

52
00:05:37,755 --> 00:05:44,274
One has to accept because still, I think,

53
00:05:44,475 --> 00:05:48,475
we do not have sufficient number of Sahaja
yogis

54
00:05:48,675 --> 00:05:58,411
who can oppose all these adventures
of modern times.

55
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:02,575
We have another kind where we find

56
00:06:02,775 --> 00:06:10,977
these false gurus who aggress - specially
America.

57
00:06:11,636 --> 00:06:18,163
America is really cursed that way because
it had money,

58
00:06:18,363 --> 00:06:23,542
so all the crooks of the world came here -
just imagine.

59
00:06:23,742 --> 00:06:27,200
To have money itself is not a blessing.

60
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:33,020
They all came here and looted rich people

61
00:06:33,296 --> 00:06:37,792
and have made so much money for themself.

62
00:06:40,097 --> 00:06:44,170
This kind of exploitation

63
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:50,127
is very much dangerous, much more,

64
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:55,869
because the mind gets ruined. I have seen
many people were ruined,

65
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:02,019
specially many seekers were ruined
completely.

66
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:10,056
I hope they are born again and get their
Self-realization.

67
00:07:10,256 --> 00:07:13,311
The seeking is there, no doubt,

68
00:07:13,511 --> 00:07:20,001
but all kinds of obstacles have come,
all kinds of temptations are there.

69
00:07:20,202 --> 00:07:30,582
And so, despite all that seeking, earnest
seeking, honest seeking,

70
00:07:30,782 --> 00:07:37,022
they have fallen into traps, which I cannot
explain

71
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:43,071
why should it have happened, but it has
happened - one has to see.

72
00:07:43,272 --> 00:07:50,156
It's a - makes you very miserable, unhappy.

73
00:07:51,184 --> 00:07:56,927
But still so many are there, you are there,
saved now.

74
00:07:57,127 --> 00:08:04,039
And in this Last Judgment you have risen
from that level

75
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,433
to this new level, where I am sure

76
00:08:08,633 --> 00:08:14,195
you will be able to salvage many more.

77
00:08:14,396 --> 00:08:20,893
Each person can salvage at least thousand
people, and so many of you,

78
00:08:21,094 --> 00:08:27,835
if you try that, it would be of a very,
very great,

79
00:08:28,035 --> 00:08:36,881
very great emancipation for this world
which we are all to save.

80
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:46,630
So one must know the first, first duty
of every Sahaja yogi now

81
00:08:46,831 --> 00:08:52,727
is to save others, to talk about Sahaja
Yoga,

82
00:08:52,928 --> 00:09:00,945
to work out Sahaja Yoga in different
places.

83
00:09:01,146 --> 00:09:05,522
For example now, I was surprised that they
are working out

84
00:09:05,722 --> 00:09:13,599
on children who are abused. They are also
in India, we are working out

85
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,454
on various places like prisons, armies.

86
00:09:19,655 --> 00:09:24,309
So you can enter into all kinds
of activities,

87
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:35,960
you can enter into all kinds of aggressed
places and save people.

88
00:09:36,161 --> 00:09:42,468
But worst of all, I think, is the innocence
is under attack

89
00:09:42,668 --> 00:09:46,097
in these Western countries, specially
in America.

90
00:09:46,298 --> 00:09:54,072
The innocence is under attack and this is
something is very dangerous,

91
00:09:54,272 --> 00:10:04,011
because the children get this mutation
at a very young age,

92
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:07,454
and what will happen to them?

93
00:10:07,645 --> 00:10:14,300
So we have to think of all those innocent
children,

94
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:20,563
what we can do for them, how we can save
them,

95
00:10:20,763 --> 00:10:23,676
how we can work it out.

96
00:10:23,877 --> 00:10:29,344
The concern has to now go from yourself
to others.

97
00:10:29,544 --> 00:10:34,678
You got your realization alright; you
corrected yourself,

98
00:10:34,878 --> 00:10:41,949
you are absolutely perfecting yourself;
all this is there,

99
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:46,889
but now what is to be done?

100
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:54,436
For what is this light enlightened here?
It is for others.

101
00:10:54,636 --> 00:11:01,095
So now Sahaja yogis have to live for others,
and not for themselves.

102
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:05,131
They'll have all the energy, they'll have
all the support

103
00:11:05,308 --> 00:11:10,306
and they'll have all the blessings. So we
have to live for others.

104
00:11:10,507 --> 00:11:15,297
And how do we live for others - is very
simple,

105
00:11:15,497 --> 00:11:20,695
is to have concern, concern about
everything.

106
00:11:20,896 --> 00:11:27,112
You have concern about the Mother
Earth, concern about your neighbors,

107
00:11:27,313 --> 00:11:34,541
concern about the people who's suffering
all over the world.

108
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:40,604
If you read the newspaper you will be
amazed how

109
00:11:40,804 --> 00:11:46,366
things are happening, how people are
suffering.

110
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:49,528
We have to understand fundamentally

111
00:11:49,728 --> 00:11:53,837
that unless and until transformation takes
place,

112
00:11:54,037 --> 00:11:59,561
we cannot change this world. And you all
can transform others,

113
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:05,349
so it's your duty, it's your job
to transform other people

114
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:11,096
and tell them what is divine love.

115
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:15,617
Love is the only way now we can work out.

116
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:24,441
It is something like a big, big hole which
should go into this darkness of aggression,

117
00:12:24,642 --> 00:12:32,380
and which will clarify many places, many
hearts, many people.

118
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:43,479
It is a ocean, we should say, ocean
of greatness.

119
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:49,463
This divine love is so great

120
00:12:49,663 --> 00:12:57,854
and so powerful, at the same time so very
gentle

121
00:12:58,054 --> 00:13:03,557
that you can see the nature, how, how
the trees grow:

122
00:13:03,757 --> 00:13:12,995
every leaf gets the sunshine, every tree
has its own position.

123
00:13:13,195 --> 00:13:16,417
We have to learn so much from the nature,

124
00:13:16,618 --> 00:13:22,506
because nature is bound with that love.

125
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:28,358
Nature has no aggressiveness.

126
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:35,910
It is just under the complete control
of the divine love.

127
00:13:36,111 --> 00:13:41,714
With this understanding you should also
know

128
00:13:41,915 --> 00:13:47,985
that when you are getting to Sahaja yogis

129
00:13:48,185 --> 00:13:53,849
what should be your attitude: how you
should move,

130
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:59,463
how you should talk to them, how you should
understand them,

131
00:13:59,663 --> 00:14:03,043
how you should express your love.

132
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:11,020
This is quite possible now, it's not
difficult.

133
00:14:11,221 --> 00:14:16,008
You should not be afraid, not feel shy.

134
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:24,899
But in a sweet manner you can talk to them,

135
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:31,035
you can communicate with them, you can
tell them;

136
00:14:31,626 --> 00:14:39,896
because this was the time, this was
to happen,

137
00:14:40,097 --> 00:14:43,774
that's the reason Adi Shakti had to come.

138
00:14:43,975 --> 00:14:48,100
Without Her, it would not have been
possible.

139
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:52,767
All other incarnations were there,

140
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:57,406
but firstly, they were only on one chakras,

141
00:14:57,606 --> 00:15:01,350
and another one was they had to establish
themselves

142
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:05,948
with other people, with the people around.

143
00:15:06,148 --> 00:15:09,317
They did try and they worked it out,

144
00:15:09,517 --> 00:15:15,471
but it didn't really work in the real sense
of the word.

145
00:15:15,672 --> 00:15:23,257
So Adi Shakti had to come, who has all
of them with Her.

146
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:30,333
They're all with us, all the time wanting
to help you

147
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:39,353
to do everything that you want to achieve.
It is there with -

148
00:15:39,553 --> 00:15:48,566
these holy vibrations are with you

149
00:15:48,766 --> 00:15:53,410
for every kind of good work you want to do,

150
00:15:53,611 --> 00:15:57,617
any kind of Sahaj work you want to do,

151
00:15:57,818 --> 00:16:03,779
these vibrations will definitely be there
to guide you,

152
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:11,992
 to help you, to support you and to love
you. You will be amazed how

153
00:16:12,192 --> 00:16:16,590
people, once they start working for Sahaja
Yoga,

154
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:21,657
how they are blessed from every angle.

155
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:30,572
So, one has to decide in their own minds

156
00:16:30,773 --> 00:16:38,476
that all your dreams have to come true.

157
00:16:38,676 --> 00:16:45,284
So only thing what you have to do is
to know only that

158
00:16:45,485 --> 00:16:53,786
your purpose of life is to spread Sahaja
Yoga.

159
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:58,109
Even now many Sahaja yogis write to Me,

160
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,757
"Mother, this is happening to me, that is
happening,

161
00:17:00,957 --> 00:17:07,534
my father like that, mother like that" -
but very few.

162
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:11,751
Practically this is over now.

163
00:17:12,226 --> 00:17:19,141
They used to write, I should say, all such
letters,

164
00:17:19,341 --> 00:17:24,840
but now I think they are all been perfected,
I don't know what has happened.

165
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:34,645
It's a very unique time where there's light
everywhere,

166
00:17:37,297 --> 00:17:45,895
the nature is absolutely with you. You can
see how nature acts,

167
00:17:46,096 --> 00:17:50,191
how it is trying to help you and support
you,

168
00:17:50,392 --> 00:17:54,612
and how it wants to work out everything
for you.

169
00:17:54,812 --> 00:18:02,027
It is to be just understood and felt

170
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:12,092
that you are something very special, and
that you have all the help,

171
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:19,712
everyone of you. It's not one person,
two persons,

172
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:27,235
it's not ten persons who - it's the whole
lot, as if the whole ocean

173
00:18:27,436 --> 00:18:36,932
is there to help you, help you to swim over
to save so many.

174
00:18:37,132 --> 00:18:45,748
You haven't seen such an ocean where there
is so much depth,

175
00:18:45,949 --> 00:18:51,291
and all the waves try to save you,

176
00:18:51,491 --> 00:19:01,001
to make you float in the realm of joy.

177
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:09,181
All this has happened to you because there
is a purpose.

178
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:14,294
It's not just because you have done poorva
punyas and all that.

179
00:19:14,495 --> 00:19:20,826
Many people say, "Because of previous life
we have got it".

180
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:26,584
That is true. The cause may be that,

181
00:19:26,785 --> 00:19:34,034
but the result is that now you are capable
of giving realization to people,

182
00:19:34,234 --> 00:19:36,840
and this is what you have to do.

183
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:43,169
All the way you have come here in this
wilderness.

184
00:19:44,088 --> 00:19:50,202
From this wilderness only, you will rise

185
00:19:50,403 --> 00:19:54,840
and you will bless all the people
of the world.

186
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,198
Specially America should be blessed again
and again,

187
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:11,743
because it's the Virat, it is Shri
Krishna's land,

188
00:20:12,172 --> 00:20:20,210
because people will always try to follow,
to copy you.

189
00:20:20,756 --> 00:20:26,005
Things will improve

190
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:35,676
if you get the, we can say the blessings

191
00:20:35,877 --> 00:20:41,334
of the various lotuses you have within
yourself, no doubt.

192
00:20:41,534 --> 00:20:47,331
But what about you doing something,

193
00:20:48,244 --> 00:20:56,192
what about you doing something about it?
And this is what is very important.

194
00:20:56,393 --> 00:21:01,811
Now only thing what you have to do about
yourself

195
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:12,209
is to find out about your own activities,

196
00:21:12,454 --> 00:21:16,311
what activities you have been doing.

197
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:23,838
You have to find out what have you done,
and what you can do.

198
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:32,002
When you meditate you think about yourself,
how much you have grown,

199
00:21:32,203 --> 00:21:38,044
what have you done, what have you given
to others.

200
00:21:38,244 --> 00:21:43,369
Whatever you've got, unless and until you
distribute it, it won't increase.

201
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:48,885
That is the fundamental law, and that
works. I've seen people

202
00:21:49,085 --> 00:21:55,188
who are realized souls, who are very good,

203
00:21:55,388 --> 00:21:58,476
who know everything about Sahaja Yog

204
00:21:58,677 --> 00:22:08,169
but are not yet that much confident,
I should say, or that much deep.

205
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:15,738
All this is only possible if you yourself

206
00:22:15,939 --> 00:22:23,986
get into creating new Sahaja yogis,

207
00:22:25,192 --> 00:22:29,942
and more Sahaja yogis - not for popularity,

208
00:22:30,143 --> 00:22:36,444
but for their good and for the good
of the whole.

209
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,860
I was asked that I should come and stay
in America

210
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:48,821
so America will improve very much. So now
here I am.

211
00:22:49,021 --> 00:22:52,193
I came here, I stayed here,

212
00:22:52,393 --> 00:22:59,892
and I am definitely putting all My
attention,

213
00:23:00,092 --> 00:23:07,589
because it's a very important, very, very
important chakra

214
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:14,829
which is this, which is America.

215
00:23:15,072 --> 00:23:28,688
And this very important country is doing
sometimes very stupid things.

216
00:23:28,889 --> 00:23:32,792
I would not say that you enter into
politics - no.

217
00:23:32,993 --> 00:23:38,610
I would not say you get into any opposition
and form a group - no.

218
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:42,744
But you also know that you have powers.

219
00:23:42,944 --> 00:23:48,670
Even your thought, your desire has powers.

220
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:55,107
Try to experiment with it. Once you
experiment, you will find out

221
00:23:55,307 --> 00:24:01,460
that only the attention that you put
to these things, it will work out,

222
00:24:01,745 --> 00:24:05,495
I am sure it will work out.

223
00:24:07,015 --> 00:24:14,476
It is a country which can definitely help

224
00:24:15,856 --> 00:24:20,249
for the emancipation of the whole human
beings.

225
00:24:20,449 --> 00:24:26,280
But on the contrary, it is going
on the other way round.

226
00:24:26,978 --> 00:24:30,202
I mean, American culture, I don't
understand at all

227
00:24:30,403 --> 00:24:38,593
what is American culture is. Is something -

228
00:24:39,371 --> 00:24:43,693
they say something, do something else.

229
00:24:44,328 --> 00:24:53,687
They've no proper value system which is
accepted by everyone,

230
00:24:53,887 --> 00:24:58,891
which is built traditionally from days
together.

231
00:24:59,147 --> 00:25:06,528
The value system is so convoluted,
so twisted

232
00:25:06,729 --> 00:25:12,940
that it's only a Sahaja yogi by his
nobility, by his greatness

233
00:25:13,141 --> 00:25:17,356
can disentangle these people.

234
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:25,085
They have funny ideas, and those funny
ideas should not

235
00:25:25,286 --> 00:25:31,579
deter you, should not stop you; for you
know that they are stupid,

236
00:25:31,779 --> 00:25:41,070
they are destructive and they will destroy
all the, all the good qualities.

237
00:25:41,618 --> 00:25:47,671
You should know that the responsibility
of Americans

238
00:25:47,872 --> 00:25:54,254
is much greater than the responsibility
of any other Sahaja yogis,

239
00:25:54,455 --> 00:26:01,724
because they are accepted and regarded

240
00:26:03,106 --> 00:26:19,395
as the most competent people, as the most
effective people by the divine Power.

241
00:26:19,596 --> 00:26:26,826
Divine Power thinks that now you can go
all ahead,

242
00:26:27,027 --> 00:26:31,357
you can do so much, and let us see.

243
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:36,467
Like we have the power and the machinery,

244
00:26:36,668 --> 00:26:44,285
but the machinery if it doesn't work, what's
the use of the power? It is useless.

245
00:26:44,486 --> 00:26:51,784
So the machinery has to work, and it is
working, it is spreading,

246
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:55,730
but we have to double our efforts.

247
00:26:55,930 --> 00:27:00,842
I was thinking of doing some sort
of a social work here

248
00:27:01,043 --> 00:27:07,220
so that it will go, it will be caught
in the eyes of many people.

249
00:27:08,633 --> 00:27:13,286
On a subtler level we have worked,

250
00:27:36,249 --> 00:27:42,731
but now we have to work it on the surface.

251
00:27:42,931 --> 00:27:52,097
Subtler level we are there, we have
achieved and we can achieve much more.

252
00:27:52,298 --> 00:28:00,030
But we should come out of it and think
what can we do on the surface,

253
00:28:00,231 --> 00:28:08,393
so that people see what is Sahaja Yoga is,
and what it can do to people.

254
00:28:09,405 --> 00:28:18,894
It's your personal behavior, your collective
behavior, your national behavior,

255
00:28:19,095 --> 00:28:27,643
all are going to change the atmosphere
which is supposed to be superficial,

256
00:28:27,843 --> 00:28:32,057
so that that also becomes subtler.

257
00:28:32,257 --> 00:28:38,768
I've been saying this in many places, but
at this puja I think it is important to say

258
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:42,631
that if you are really facing the Adi
Shakti,

259
00:28:42,832 --> 00:28:48,321
then you must know your powers are
boundless.

260
00:28:49,905 --> 00:28:55,457
You have to just assert those powers.

261
00:28:55,761 --> 00:29:01,653
It is not a stationary power. It’s, there's
a movement in it,

262
00:29:01,853 --> 00:29:05,287
and there's a right type of a movement.

263
00:29:05,487 --> 00:29:10,074
It knows where to enter, how to work it
out. Now look at this place.

264
00:29:10,274 --> 00:29:15,808
Can you imagine Me thinking about a place
like this?

265
00:29:16,009 --> 00:29:19,746
But I was just had in mind of course,
I must say,

266
00:29:19,946 --> 00:29:23,662
that we should have some place here,
because

267
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:30,566
the American Sahaja yogis didn't have any
place to meet - that's all.

268
00:29:30,767 --> 00:29:33,735
And see how I got it!

269
00:29:33,935 --> 00:29:39,689
But the desire to do all this

270
00:29:39,889 --> 00:29:46,316
should be there within your subtler level,
and then it works.

271
00:29:46,517 --> 00:29:50,097
It works, it's like a magic, I tell you.

272
00:29:50,297 --> 00:29:56,293
Now you have faith in yourself and decide
about it.

273
00:29:56,494 --> 00:30:04,363
I am so very happy that it has been
achieved

274
00:30:04,563 --> 00:30:10,875
with such ease - unbelievable, with such
ease.

275
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:17,112
Absolutely, nothing great was done.

276
00:30:17,312 --> 00:30:22,345
The way we got this was so simple,

277
00:30:22,545 --> 00:30:28,053
that just like another Sahaja yogi
the person was to sell us

278
00:30:28,254 --> 00:30:35,590
came down so excited, and he just sold it
to us, finished.

279
00:30:36,138 --> 00:30:41,682
We didn't have to do anything to convince
him

280
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:49,146
or to talk to him or reduce the price -
nothing. And he sold it out to us.

281
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:54,932
In the same way whatever on a subtler level
you desire,

282
00:30:55,132 --> 00:31:01,400
it becomes a terrific force which moves
by itself,

283
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:12,701
which knows where to go, how to enter, into
which area, and it gets the thing done.

284
00:31:12,932 --> 00:31:21,991
It's something we all should experience,
and work it out with full confidence.

285
00:31:22,191 --> 00:31:27,846
It is the love that we have, the concern
we have.

286
00:31:28,046 --> 00:31:34,621
This is the power that has given us
Self-realization, and this is the power

287
00:31:34,821 --> 00:31:40,599
that has given us this enrichment
of achievements.

288
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,825
I am sure all of you who are here will
realize

289
00:31:46,025 --> 00:31:51,088
how it was done - I mean, so quickly.
This is one of the things

290
00:31:51,288 --> 00:31:59,807
that should just tell you what we are
capable of doing,

291
00:32:01,145 --> 00:32:04,134
what we are capable of achieving.

292
00:32:04,335 --> 00:32:13,487
And when you think of so many people who
are lost in the mire of ignorance,

293
00:32:13,687 --> 00:32:18,486
we should really feel from inside that
concern

294
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:28,887
and that hankering, "How can I help these
people?"

295
00:32:29,212 --> 00:32:33,453
And you'll be amazed, once you think like
that,

296
00:32:33,654 --> 00:32:37,946
how this divine Power, this Force, will
come in.

297
00:32:38,146 --> 00:32:46,792
Forget about petty things and petty
problems, they're nothing.

298
00:32:46,992 --> 00:32:51,287
You have such a powerful thing behind you.

299
00:32:51,487 --> 00:32:57,159
It's true that all this universe was
created, everything was created

300
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:00,452
and then you were created, and all that
is done.

301
00:33:00,652 --> 00:33:04,998
But the greatest thing this Power has done
is to create

302
00:33:05,198 --> 00:33:09,310
Sahaja yogis. This is the greatest thing.

303
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:17,637
Those who have knowledge, those who have
the pure knowledge

304
00:33:17,838 --> 00:33:25,424
and those who have the divine love in their
heart,

305
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:30,992
what a tremendous personality it is. Just
think of that,

306
00:33:31,192 --> 00:33:39,645
and you will get all the opportunities
to express that love.

307
00:33:39,845 --> 00:33:43,203
So may God bless you.
