00:00:05.726 --> 00:00:12.949
After seeing this love,

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.660
my heart is filled.

00:00:25.482 --> 00:00:30.376
And I am thinking

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:34.273
that love is such a big power

00:00:34.997 --> 00:00:39.691
by which so many people are attracted

00:00:39.867 --> 00:00:42.938
and become happy.

00:00:43.791 --> 00:00:48.902
This is such a surprising thing.

00:00:49.406 --> 00:00:51.286
In this Kali Yuga,

00:00:51.477 --> 00:00:57.461
no one would have seen this greatness of love.

00:01:01.422 --> 00:01:08.539
I think that after seeing this,

00:01:09.208 --> 00:01:14.918
all of you should learn to increase your love.

00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:24.589
And this thing is very easy.

00:01:25.197 --> 00:01:27.225
And you can do it in this way-

00:01:27.426 --> 00:01:33.085
by meditating morning and evening,

00:01:34.025 --> 00:01:40.233
then the bad thoughts in your mind

00:01:41.544 --> 00:01:47.391
which cause jealousy and anger

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:52.336
and you get hurt by small things,

00:01:52.537 --> 00:01:55.980
all such thoughts will end.

00:01:58.632 --> 00:02:02.346
And after that whatâ€™s left

00:02:03.094 --> 00:02:06.237
its Nirmal prem.

00:02:06.945 --> 00:02:09.176
With this love

00:02:09.377 --> 00:02:12.930
you can give the whole world

00:02:13.965 --> 00:02:17.116
a new life.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.280
I have told them in Hindi language

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.880
that love, you can see one person's love

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.560
manifested in so many eyes here.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.480
And when I saw the enthusiasm

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.800
also My heart got filled with great love, greater love.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.800
So one can see how powerful is this love.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:02.320
All kinds of bad feelings, negative thinking

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.880
and also self-destructive elements

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.600
can be corrected and controlled very simply in Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:21.000
if you with sincere heart meditate morning and evening, twice.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.000
That time you shouldn't see your watches, of course,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.800
but enjoy, enjoy your meditation.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.920
That will give you such a strength to love others,

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.120
to forgive others;

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.080
instead of you feeling bad for small, small things,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.600
you feeling irritated

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.840
because you think your self-respect is challenged,

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.600
or else sometimes

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.200
we become aggressive towards some people,

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.360
very aggressive, for no fault of theirs.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.520
Best thing is to see the vibrations of another person.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.280
If the vibrations are bad, no use fighting,

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.040
it will create more confusions.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.240
A person who has very bad vibrations,

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.280
you can't fight with that person, you cannot control that person.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.040
Or a person who is too much of self-importance,

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.720
you should not try to pacify him

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.800
or sort of try to negotiate with him,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.880
or also sometimes people try to pamper his vanity.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.040
By doing that you are spoiling him more.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.360
So the best thing is to show your love

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:13.440
in very sweet and different manner.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.000
I'll give you an example which I've given many a times,

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.760
that I went to see this Gagangarh Maharaj

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.040
who was living on a very high mountain,

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.680
and there was no way of going by car or anything, and I had to walk.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.360
So everybody said, "Mother, why should You go there after all?"

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.680
I said, "You see the vibrations.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.640
Good vibrations coming, all right? That's why I'm going."

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.600
But he had told many people about Me, and he said that

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.840
"Adi Shakti is born in Bombay, why do you come to me?"

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.240
So they told us.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.320
So I said, "I must see this man,"

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.880
and that's how I went to his place to meet him.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.640
Now, he's supposed to control the rain.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.960
He could control the rain. So he was

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.080
sitting there on a stone

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.320
and he was moving his head with great

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.720
agitation when I reached there.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.920
And it was raining so heavily

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.360
that I went up to his place when I was completely drenched.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.960
So I went inside the cave where he used to live,

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.360
and he came back

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.960
with great anger towards the rain.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:56.760
So he said, "Mother, why did You not allow me to control the rain?"

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.400
I said, "I didn't do that."

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.800
"No, You did; because I can always control the rain,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.200
and You were coming all the way with my invitation,

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.160
and this rain should not have misbehaved."

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.920
I said, "No, no, he didn't misbehave."

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.400
So what happened, he was quite in a temper, you know.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.720
I said, "You settle down, I'll tell you what has happened.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.600
See, you have bought a sari for Me

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.280
and you are a sanyasi,

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.720
and I won't take a sari from a sanyasi,

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.160
so the rain has made it convenient.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.080
Now it's all drenched so I'll have to take your sari."

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.080
Immediately, you see, he felt terrible love for Me,

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.320
started crying and he fell at My feet.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.800
And then he said, "Mother, now I know

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.160
what is the greatness of love,

00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:00.120
how it takes you away from mundane things and

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.960
dry behaviour, and takes you to a place

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:10.440
where you can enjoy the showers of love."

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.680
This is one of the stories I am telling you.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.560
But the main thing behind the whole episode is this,

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.080
that you should try your love,

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:30.520
your tricks of pure love, pure love, and it works.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.160
And you must learn, gradually you will learn how to try.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.080
You should not give up.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.200
Some people are very difficult, I agree - very, very difficult.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.680
But at least try with people who are not so difficult.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.040
And you'll be amazed that you'll have a good company

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.400
and lots of friends and friendship,

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.600
as we have here now in Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.280
First time when I came to Delhi I got such a fright of this place,

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.360
because there were very few Sahaja yogis and they brought

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.600
- I don't know why they wanted to do My puja, might be

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.400
Bombay people must have told them, something

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.320
- and they brought kum-kum and everything in a plastic

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.200
little, little bottles - oh, my!

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.880
I really shrunk, you know, with their ignorance.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.400
I said, "Now what to do? What will happen?"

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:28.480
But today, see, same Delhi which has become so great

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:33.400
and so beautiful, and so enthusiastic.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.040
I saw them with their flags and

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.720
I didn't know there's such a procession of flags will be here,

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.160
though we had once or twice, I think, in Cabella.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.720
But how they were enjoying each other!

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.840
It's really remarkable. If you can enjoy love,

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.080
you won't enjoy anything else

00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:01.640
but love for other people, and not for yourself.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.240
On the contrary you will see that your body,

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.440
your mind, your thoughts,

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:14.120
everything are directed towards creating love for others,

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.240
and not for yourself.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.000
The whole attitude changes.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:25.600
Like in the darkness you can't see anything,

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:30.760
but even there's a small light, it spreads all over.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:36.200
Nobody tells the light that, "You have to spread the light

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.440
all over," but it does.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.360
In the same way you all are enlightened people,

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.920
you are all enlightened with love;

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:51.240
and the light of this love spreads automatically,

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.720
spontaneously, sahaj.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.320
I was also very much

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:03.720
enamored the way our Yuva Shakti was dancing and enjoying.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.560
I think it's a very great blessing,

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.320
because these days our young children,

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:13.880
our young people are getting astray.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.400
They are not so badly off as in other countries,

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.400
but quite a big trend is going on

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:24.920
to spoil them and to make them a, what you'd call

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:30.320
a very Westernized, spoiled personality.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.640
But now I saw so many of these dancing together,

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.000
forgetting their caste, creed, everything,

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.840
and enjoying each other's company.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.720
This is something has to happen

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.000
in this country and in every country;

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.520
that we should all feel oneness

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:55.080
and enjoy the oneness with each other.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:00.040
If we do not enjoy we are like a drop outside the ocean,

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.640
which can be dried any time.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.880
But if you are a part and a parcel of that ocean,

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:11.720
then what happens is that every

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:15.160
movement of the ocean you carry with you,

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:20.200
and you are part and parcel of that ocean absolutely,

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:25.200
because you do not have separate identity.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.320
All these things that make a separate identity

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.960
in our society or in our culture

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.800
or in our behavior, in personal lives,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.880
all should be completely curbed down.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.040
And this will settle many problems,

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:50.600
from family life to national life, to international life.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.680
So we should curb down all such feelings of separatedness,

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.200
that we should have a separate house, separate state,

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.160
separate nation.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:07.200
Gradually all nations will become one, I am sure of that;

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.720
because great times are coming,

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:15.680
and so many people at the helm of affairs will take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.760
Once they take to Sahaja Yog,

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.800
then things will be very much different.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.040
Today it is not with them,

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.880
Sahaja Yoga is not with them.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:33.960
They have no knowledge of our great movement of love,

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.920
so they want to have separate of everything.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.640
They don't know tomorrow they will be scorched away

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:46.120
with the heat around or maybe with the rain they'll be washed away,

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:51.000
or maybe that the Mother Earth might absorb them.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:56.600
So we all should be together, whatever may be the differences.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.720
In different families we are born - after all,

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.280
all cannot be born in one family.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.440
But now you belong to Sahaja Yoga family,

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.480
and this Sahaja Yoga family is one.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.880
It doesn't believe in having separate existence

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.800
or separate speciality.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
We are all one with each other,

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.280
and we don't care what sort of differences are outside.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:24.600
I was really very much touched,

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.560
because now the new year is coming with

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.440
a new challenge for all of us

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.800
which we have to accept, that Kali Yuga is over

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.800
and we have to establish the Satya Yuga;

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.920
for which all of you from every country should have thinking,

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.520
how you can do it in your country and in other countries.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.200
What are the problems in another country?

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.360
Put your attention outside, not inside

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.800
this way that you should say

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.000
that I need this, I need that, I need that.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:03.800
We should know what other people need:

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.880
what is their need,

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:11.520
what the people in our society, in our nation,

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:16.040
in our world require?

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.640
Better write them down: what do they require?

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:24.240
It's better, it will work; might be, it might be corrected.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.440
It's very important for Sahaja yogis to sit down

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:32.840
and write down what the world needs, and what is to be done.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.320
It will be a nice idea for all of you

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:40.240
to really aspire for that kind of homogeneous society

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.360
that we have here today.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.240
And we'll be one day, you will be surprised

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.120
that we will be the ones who will guide

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:56.400
and lead the rest of the people with our love, attention and care.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.320
So it's very important time,

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.720
and at this time we should all think on those lines.

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:07.120
Thank you very much. May God bless you.
