WEBVTT

00:05.726 --> 00:12.949
After seeing this love,

00:13.150 --> 00:16.660
my heart is filled.

00:25.482 --> 00:30.376
And I am thinking

00:30.559 --> 00:34.273
that love is such a big power

00:34.997 --> 00:39.691
by which so many people are attracted

00:39.867 --> 00:42.938
and become happy.

00:43.791 --> 00:48.902
This is such a surprising thing.

00:49.406 --> 00:51.286
In this Kali Yuga,

00:51.477 --> 00:57.461
no one would have seen this greatness of love.

01:01.422 --> 01:08.539
I think that after seeing this,

01:09.208 --> 01:14.918
all of you should learn to increase your love.

01:20.875 --> 01:24.589
And this thing is very easy.

01:25.197 --> 01:27.225
And you can do it in this way-

01:27.426 --> 01:33.085
by meditating morning and evening,

01:34.025 --> 01:40.233
then the bad thoughts in your mind

01:41.544 --> 01:47.391
which cause jealousy and anger

01:48.099 --> 01:52.336
and you get hurt by small things,

01:52.537 --> 01:55.980
all such thoughts will end.

01:58.632 --> 02:02.346
And after that whatâ€™s left

02:03.094 --> 02:06.237
its Nirmal prem.

02:06.945 --> 02:09.176
With this love

02:09.377 --> 02:12.930
you can give the whole world

02:13.965 --> 02:17.116
a new life.

02:26.200 --> 02:30.280
I have told them in Hindi language

02:30.480 --> 02:33.880
that love, you can see one person's love

02:34.120 --> 02:37.560
manifested in so many eyes here.

02:37.840 --> 02:40.480
And when I saw the enthusiasm

02:40.760 --> 02:47.800
also My heart got filled with great love, greater love.

02:49.360 --> 02:54.800
So one can see how powerful is this love.

02:55.200 --> 03:02.320
All kinds of bad feelings, negative thinking

03:02.880 --> 03:07.880
and also self-destructive elements

03:08.080 --> 03:13.600
can be corrected and controlled very simply in Sahaja Yoga,

03:13.840 --> 03:21.000
if you with sincere heart meditate morning and evening, twice.

03:21.640 --> 03:25.000
That time you shouldn't see your watches, of course,

03:25.200 --> 03:29.800
but enjoy, enjoy your meditation.

03:30.280 --> 03:33.920
That will give you such a strength to love others,

03:34.120 --> 03:36.120
to forgive others;

03:36.640 --> 03:41.080
instead of you feeling bad for small, small things,

03:41.280 --> 03:45.600
you feeling irritated

03:45.880 --> 03:51.840
because you think your self-respect is challenged,

03:52.040 --> 03:55.600
or else sometimes

03:55.840 --> 04:01.200
we become aggressive towards some people,

04:01.560 --> 04:07.360
very aggressive, for no fault of theirs.

04:07.920 --> 04:13.520
Best thing is to see the vibrations of another person.

04:13.920 --> 04:19.280
If the vibrations are bad, no use fighting,

04:19.640 --> 04:24.040
it will create more confusions.

04:25.160 --> 04:28.240
A person who has very bad vibrations,

04:28.480 --> 04:34.280
you can't fight with that person, you cannot control that person.

04:34.760 --> 04:40.040
Or a person who is too much of self-importance,

04:40.440 --> 04:45.720
you should not try to pacify him

04:46.040 --> 04:52.800
or sort of try to negotiate with him,

04:53.000 --> 04:58.880
or also sometimes people try to pamper his vanity.

04:59.080 --> 05:03.040
By doing that you are spoiling him more.

05:03.240 --> 05:07.360
So the best thing is to show your love

05:07.640 --> 05:13.440
in very sweet and different manner.

05:13.960 --> 05:18.000
I'll give you an example which I've given many a times,

05:18.280 --> 05:21.760
that I went to see this Gagangarh Maharaj

05:22.040 --> 05:25.040
who was living on a very high mountain,

05:25.360 --> 05:29.680
and there was no way of going by car or anything, and I had to walk.

05:29.880 --> 05:33.360
So everybody said, "Mother, why should You go there after all?"

05:33.560 --> 05:35.680
I said, "You see the vibrations.

05:35.880 --> 05:40.640
Good vibrations coming, all right? That's why I'm going."

05:40.840 --> 05:44.600
But he had told many people about Me, and he said that

05:44.800 --> 05:48.840
"Adi Shakti is born in Bombay, why do you come to me?"

05:49.040 --> 05:52.240
So they told us.

05:52.640 --> 05:56.320
So I said, "I must see this man,"

05:57.760 --> 06:01.880
and that's how I went to his place to meet him.

06:02.280 --> 06:06.640
Now, he's supposed to control the rain.

06:07.240 --> 06:11.960
He could control the rain. So he was

06:12.520 --> 06:17.080
sitting there on a stone

06:17.560 --> 06:22.320
and he was moving his head with great

06:22.560 --> 06:26.720
agitation when I reached there.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.920
And it was raining so heavily

06:30.240 --> 06:35.360
that I went up to his place when I was completely drenched.

06:35.680 --> 06:39.960
So I went inside the cave where he used to live,

06:40.400 --> 06:45.360
and he came back

06:45.640 --> 06:49.960
with great anger towards the rain.

06:50.320 --> 06:56.760
So he said, "Mother, why did You not allow me to control the rain?"

06:57.400 --> 06:59.400
I said, "I didn't do that."

06:59.600 --> 07:02.800
"No, You did; because I can always control the rain,

07:03.000 --> 07:06.200
and You were coming all the way with my invitation,

07:06.400 --> 07:09.160
and this rain should not have misbehaved."

07:09.520 --> 07:11.920
I said, "No, no, he didn't misbehave."

07:12.280 --> 07:16.400
So what happened, he was quite in a temper, you know.

07:16.600 --> 07:20.720
I said, "You settle down, I'll tell you what has happened.

07:21.240 --> 07:24.600
See, you have bought a sari for Me

07:24.880 --> 07:27.280
and you are a sanyasi,

07:27.640 --> 07:30.720
and I won't take a sari from a sanyasi,

07:30.920 --> 07:33.160
so the rain has made it convenient.

07:33.360 --> 07:38.080
Now it's all drenched so I'll have to take your sari."

07:38.400 --> 07:43.080
Immediately, you see, he felt terrible love for Me,

07:43.280 --> 07:48.320
started crying and he fell at My feet.

07:48.640 --> 07:51.800
And then he said, "Mother, now I know

07:52.000 --> 07:55.160
what is the greatness of love,

07:55.400 --> 08:00.120
how it takes you away from mundane things and

08:00.360 --> 08:03.960
dry behaviour, and takes you to a place

08:04.160 --> 08:10.440
where you can enjoy the showers of love."

08:11.280 --> 08:14.680
This is one of the stories I am telling you.

08:14.880 --> 08:19.560
But the main thing behind the whole episode is this,

08:19.760 --> 08:24.080
that you should try your love,

08:24.280 --> 08:30.520
your tricks of pure love, pure love, and it works.

08:31.040 --> 08:34.160
And you must learn, gradually you will learn how to try.

08:34.360 --> 08:36.080
You should not give up.

08:36.280 --> 08:40.200
Some people are very difficult, I agree - very, very difficult.

08:40.400 --> 08:44.680
But at least try with people who are not so difficult.

08:44.880 --> 08:48.040
And you'll be amazed that you'll have a good company

08:48.240 --> 08:51.400
and lots of friends and friendship,

08:51.600 --> 08:54.600
as we have here now in Sahaja Yoga.

08:54.960 --> 08:59.280
First time when I came to Delhi I got such a fright of this place,

08:59.560 --> 09:03.360
because there were very few Sahaja yogis and they brought

09:03.560 --> 09:06.600
- I don't know why they wanted to do My puja, might be

09:06.800 --> 09:09.400
Bombay people must have told them, something

09:09.720 --> 09:12.320
- and they brought kum-kum and everything in a plastic

09:12.560 --> 09:15.200
little, little bottles - oh, my!

09:15.400 --> 09:17.880
I really shrunk, you know, with their ignorance.

09:18.120 --> 09:21.400
I said, "Now what to do? What will happen?"

09:21.600 --> 09:28.480
But today, see, same Delhi which has become so great

09:28.760 --> 09:33.400
and so beautiful, and so enthusiastic.

09:33.600 --> 09:36.040
I saw them with their flags and

09:36.240 --> 09:40.720
I didn't know there's such a procession of flags will be here,

09:40.920 --> 09:45.160
though we had once or twice, I think, in Cabella.

09:45.400 --> 09:48.720
But how they were enjoying each other!

09:49.000 --> 09:53.840
It's really remarkable. If you can enjoy love,

09:54.080 --> 09:56.080
you won't enjoy anything else

09:56.280 --> 10:01.640
but love for other people, and not for yourself.

10:02.160 --> 10:06.240
On the contrary you will see that your body,

10:06.440 --> 10:09.440
your mind, your thoughts,

10:09.640 --> 10:14.120
everything are directed towards creating love for others,

10:14.320 --> 10:17.240
and not for yourself.

10:17.480 --> 10:21.000
The whole attitude changes.

10:21.400 --> 10:25.600
Like in the darkness you can't see anything,

10:26.080 --> 10:30.760
but even there's a small light, it spreads all over.

10:30.960 --> 10:36.200
Nobody tells the light that, "You have to spread the light

10:36.800 --> 10:39.440
all over," but it does.

10:39.640 --> 10:43.360
In the same way you all are enlightened people,

10:43.600 --> 10:45.920
you are all enlightened with love;

10:46.280 --> 10:51.240
and the light of this love spreads automatically,

10:51.400 --> 10:54.720
spontaneously, sahaj.

10:55.720 --> 10:58.320
I was also very much

10:58.600 --> 11:03.720
enamored the way our Yuva Shakti was dancing and enjoying.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.560
I think it's a very great blessing,

11:06.760 --> 11:09.320
because these days our young children,

11:09.520 --> 11:13.880
our young people are getting astray.

11:14.240 --> 11:17.400
They are not so badly off as in other countries,

11:17.600 --> 11:20.400
but quite a big trend is going on

11:20.760 --> 11:24.920
to spoil them and to make them a, what you'd call

11:25.120 --> 11:30.320
a very Westernized, spoiled personality.

11:30.600 --> 11:34.640
But now I saw so many of these dancing together,

11:34.840 --> 11:38.000
forgetting their caste, creed, everything,

11:38.200 --> 11:41.840
and enjoying each other's company.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.720
This is something has to happen

11:45.120 --> 11:48.000
in this country and in every country;

11:48.200 --> 11:50.520
that we should all feel oneness

11:50.760 --> 11:55.080
and enjoy the oneness with each other.

11:55.440 --> 12:00.040
If we do not enjoy we are like a drop outside the ocean,

12:00.600 --> 12:02.640
which can be dried any time.

12:02.840 --> 12:05.880
But if you are a part and a parcel of that ocean,

12:06.120 --> 12:11.720
then what happens is that every

12:11.920 --> 12:15.160
movement of the ocean you carry with you,

12:15.360 --> 12:20.200
and you are part and parcel of that ocean absolutely,

12:20.400 --> 12:25.200
because you do not have separate identity.

12:25.560 --> 12:29.320
All these things that make a separate identity

12:29.760 --> 12:33.960
in our society or in our culture

12:34.160 --> 12:38.800
or in our behavior, in personal lives,

12:39.000 --> 12:42.880
all should be completely curbed down.

12:43.240 --> 12:46.040
And this will settle many problems,

12:46.240 --> 12:50.600
from family life to national life, to international life.

12:50.800 --> 12:55.680
So we should curb down all such feelings of separatedness,

12:55.880 --> 12:59.200
that we should have a separate house, separate state,

12:59.400 --> 13:03.160
separate nation.

13:03.560 --> 13:07.200
Gradually all nations will become one, I am sure of that;

13:07.400 --> 13:09.720
because great times are coming,

13:09.920 --> 13:15.680
and so many people at the helm of affairs will take to Sahaja Yoga.

13:15.960 --> 13:17.760
Once they take to Sahaja Yog,

13:17.960 --> 13:20.800
then things will be very much different.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.040
Today it is not with them,

13:24.400 --> 13:26.880
Sahaja Yoga is not with them.

13:27.080 --> 13:33.960
They have no knowledge of our great movement of love,

13:34.360 --> 13:36.920
so they want to have separate of everything.

13:37.120 --> 13:40.640
They don't know tomorrow they will be scorched away

13:40.840 --> 13:46.120
with the heat around or maybe with the rain they'll be washed away,

13:46.320 --> 13:51.000
or maybe that the Mother Earth might absorb them.

13:51.360 --> 13:56.600
So we all should be together, whatever may be the differences.

13:56.960 --> 13:59.720
In different families we are born - after all,

13:59.920 --> 14:02.280
all cannot be born in one family.

14:02.480 --> 14:05.440
But now you belong to Sahaja Yoga family,

14:05.640 --> 14:08.480
and this Sahaja Yoga family is one.

14:08.760 --> 14:11.880
It doesn't believe in having separate existence

14:12.120 --> 14:14.800
or separate speciality.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
We are all one with each other,

14:17.200 --> 14:21.280
and we don't care what sort of differences are outside.

14:21.880 --> 14:24.600
I was really very much touched,

14:24.800 --> 14:28.560
because now the new year is coming with

14:28.760 --> 14:31.440
a new challenge for all of us

14:31.640 --> 14:34.800
which we have to accept, that Kali Yuga is over

14:35.000 --> 14:37.800
and we have to establish the Satya Yuga;

14:38.000 --> 14:43.920
for which all of you from every country should have thinking,

14:44.120 --> 14:47.520
how you can do it in your country and in other countries.

14:47.760 --> 14:50.200
What are the problems in another country?

14:50.480 --> 14:53.360
Put your attention outside, not inside

14:53.560 --> 14:55.800
this way that you should say

14:56.040 --> 14:59.000
that I need this, I need that, I need that.

14:59.240 --> 15:03.800
We should know what other people need:

15:04.160 --> 15:06.880
what is their need,

15:07.080 --> 15:11.520
what the people in our society, in our nation,

15:11.840 --> 15:16.040
in our world require?

15:16.520 --> 15:19.640
Better write them down: what do they require?

15:19.960 --> 15:24.240
It's better, it will work; might be, it might be corrected.

15:24.440 --> 15:27.440
It's very important for Sahaja yogis to sit down

15:27.640 --> 15:32.840
and write down what the world needs, and what is to be done.

15:33.040 --> 15:35.320
It will be a nice idea for all of you

15:35.520 --> 15:40.240
to really aspire for that kind of homogeneous society

15:40.440 --> 15:42.360
that we have here today.

15:42.560 --> 15:45.240
And we'll be one day, you will be surprised

15:45.440 --> 15:49.120
that we will be the ones who will guide

15:49.320 --> 15:56.400
and lead the rest of the people with our love, attention and care.

15:57.440 --> 15:59.320
So it's very important time,

15:59.520 --> 16:02.720
and at this time we should all think on those lines.

16:03.040 --> 16:07.120
Thank you very much. May God bless you.
