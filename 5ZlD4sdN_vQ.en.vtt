00:02.375 --> 00:06.166
Gauri is the Mother of Shri Ganesha

00:12.208 --> 00:15.333
and She produced Shri Ganesha because

00:16.917 --> 00:19.333
She was having a bath,

00:20.166 --> 00:22.667
and to protect Her

00:23.999 --> 00:27.417
chastity She created Shri Ganesha.

00:29.875 --> 00:32.083
In the same way,

00:36.375 --> 00:39.125
Kundalini is the Gauri

00:39.625 --> 00:43.166
and we have got Ganesha sitting

00:44.959 --> 00:47.542
in the Mooladhara Chakra.

00:47.999 --> 00:51.542
So we have Mooladhara as

00:53.375 --> 00:58.583
the abode of the Gauri, of Kundalini,

00:59.834 --> 01:05.166
and the protection of the Kundalini is done by Shri Ganesha.

01:06.417 --> 01:09.667
As you know, Shri Ganesha is the deity

01:10.458 --> 01:14.750
which is for our innocence.

01:16.750 --> 01:23.583
Only Shri Ganesha could be there in that position

01:25.333 --> 01:27.500
because as you know the pelvic plexus looks after

01:27.709 --> 01:31.792
all the excretory functions,

01:32.041 --> 01:37.542
and it is Shri Ganesha only who can really stay there

01:39.083 --> 01:41.250
without getting

01:46.250 --> 01:49.667
dirtied by the surroundings

01:49.999 --> 01:56.041
He is so pure; He is so innocent –

01:59.917 --> 02:04.709
while the Kundalini is the virgin,

02:06.709 --> 02:09.999
the virgin Mother of Shri Ganesha.

02:11.166 --> 02:15.792
People have started talking against

02:16.999 --> 02:20.333
Mary by saying that there was something wrong:

02:20.750 --> 02:23.750
"How could a virgin get a child?"

02:25.875 --> 02:29.417
Because we do not understand it is God

02:30.999 --> 02:35.208
and in the area of God anything is possible.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.959
They're above all these things

02:41.875 --> 02:44.542
and they can create anything

02:47.125 --> 02:49.250
and in any way

02:49.458 --> 02:52.625
Ganesha had to be born out of a virgin

02:52.834 --> 02:56.834
because He was so pure.

03:00.375 --> 03:04.500
So Kundalini has to be supported by Shri Ganesha.

03:05.083 --> 03:07.583
If Shri Ganesha is weak,

03:07.917 --> 03:11.458
then Kundalini cannot be supported.

03:13.625 --> 03:17.208
Shri Ganesha has to support Her

03:19.542 --> 03:22.875
in the awakening part first of all.

03:23.375 --> 03:27.041
When the Kundalini is getting awakened,

03:28.375 --> 03:31.500
Shri Ganesha stops all the functions

03:32.125 --> 03:34.000
that it has to perform.

03:34.291 --> 03:36.999
All the functions are stopped

03:39.208 --> 03:40.792
so that

03:41.917 --> 03:43.834
you must have seen, I sit for nine hours,

03:44.041 --> 03:48.083
ten hours sometimes - I don't get up,

03:49.208 --> 03:51.166
because all functions of Shri Ganesha,

03:51.375 --> 03:55.792
everything stops when the Kundalini is rising.

03:56.375 --> 03:58.875
She is fully supported

03:59.500 --> 04:02.625
and looked after by Shri Ganesha.

04:10.792 --> 04:13.792
The Kundalini is the energy that you know

04:14.208 --> 04:16.542
which gives you your ascent,

04:17.709 --> 04:20.125
but it's a virgin energy.

04:20.999 --> 04:24.875
It's a energy that is detached;

04:25.999 --> 04:30.250
it doesn't get attached to any center,

04:31.792 --> 04:35.250
to any function.

04:35.999 --> 04:38.999
Only one function it has to do,

04:39.625 --> 04:41.166
is to

04:43.709 --> 04:46.208
slowly and steadily

04:50.291 --> 04:53.083
pass through all these centers,

04:53.999 --> 04:57.625
nourish them, give them whatever they like,

04:57.834 --> 05:00.792
whatever they want, whatever they can bear,

05:01.875 --> 05:05.959
and slowly and steadily open the Sahasrara.

05:07.417 --> 05:09.375
She is coiled up in three and a half

05:11.125 --> 05:13.041
coils.

05:13.291 --> 05:15.291
It has a mathematical significance

05:15.542 --> 05:19.458
why three and a half coils she is

05:19.999 --> 05:23.000
- I think in My book I have described about her.

05:25.208 --> 05:26.208
But

05:36.417 --> 05:38.959
though she's a virgin energy,

05:39.291 --> 05:40.999
still she is so wise,

05:41.208 --> 05:43.000
so sensible,

05:43.625 --> 05:46.583
so loving and so caring

05:47.250 --> 05:49.041
that when she rises

05:49.250 --> 05:52.083
She doesn't give any complications to you.

05:56.208 --> 06:00.250
She doesn't even make you feel that she's rising up.

06:00.500 --> 06:01.667
In some people she does,

06:01.875 --> 06:04.250
when the people are not normal,

06:04.458 --> 06:07.667
and some obstruction is there, then you do feel it;

06:08.542 --> 06:10.500
but normally

06:11.500 --> 06:14.417
you do not even feel how she is rising.

06:16.125 --> 06:18.917
She goes up in a way

06:20.750 --> 06:22.458
automatically,

06:23.417 --> 06:26.667
supported by the whole mechanism

06:27.875 --> 06:31.375
when she rises from one center to another center.

06:32.917 --> 06:37.208
The lower center first opens for her to enter in

06:37.458 --> 06:41.542
and then it augments, it closes down

06:41.792 --> 06:44.542
so that it can keep the Kundalini in its place,

06:44.792 --> 06:46.792
then it goes higher,

06:47.333 --> 06:53.750
there again till it pierces through Sahasrara,

06:54.083 --> 07:00.041
this ascending of Kundalini goes on.

07:00.333 --> 07:03.375
This is what is raja yoga.

07:04.834 --> 07:06.917
That is not artificial,

07:07.083 --> 07:11.041
something outside, but the spontaneous working

07:11.250 --> 07:13.834
of the mechanism is raj yoga.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.125
As I always say that when you start the motorcar

07:17.417 --> 07:20.709
all the mechanism starts working by itself,

07:20.917 --> 07:22.500
but by just moving the wheel

07:22.709 --> 07:24.417
you cannot make the car move.

07:24.625 --> 07:28.250
In the same way, when the Kundalini is rising,

07:29.999 --> 07:32.959
she rises spontaneously

07:33.166 --> 07:37.750
and passes through these six centers.

07:38.750 --> 07:42.792
That time she also at Vishuddhi,

07:45.667 --> 07:49.792
she opens the Vishuddhi

07:51.750 --> 07:55.959
and when she emerges through it at that time

07:56.208 --> 07:59.291
the tongue is a little bit pulled in

08:00.250 --> 08:02.458
just to keep the flow on.

08:02.750 --> 08:06.000
This reaction is called as khechari.

08:06.333 --> 08:12.083
So when people are very deeply in meditation,

08:12.458 --> 08:16.125
those who have achieved great heights in meditation,

08:18.125 --> 08:23.709
they find suddenly they get into khechari situation,

08:24.125 --> 08:28.333
or we call as mudra, in that state

08:31.208 --> 08:38.417
as if some nectar starts flowing from your palate.

08:38.834 --> 08:42.999
If you move your tongue upward like that

08:43.208 --> 08:48.166
you'll feel the cool coming down your tongue,

08:48.417 --> 08:50.625
try that.

08:58.750 --> 09:00.999
Now this, you don't have to do

09:01.166 --> 09:04.583
when you are in deep meditative state.

09:04.792 --> 09:07.333
It starts cooling down your tongue slowly

09:07.667 --> 09:12.208
as automatically you get into khechari state.

09:13.083 --> 09:15.834
As far as Sahaja yogis are concerned today,

09:16.041 --> 09:18.959
there are very few who really feel that way.

09:19.417 --> 09:21.999
The reason is you do not meditate.

09:22.250 --> 09:26.709
We do not pay attention to our realization, also.

09:26.959 --> 09:29.500
We talk about it quite a lot, in the West specially

09:29.750 --> 09:33.500
we discuss it more than to do something about it.

09:33.792 --> 09:38.458
We have to meditate every day,

09:38.750 --> 09:42.625
just like washing our hands

09:42.834 --> 09:45.208
or just like cleaning our teeth,

09:45.500 --> 09:47.750
we have to in the morning-time meditate

09:47.999 --> 09:50.834
and also in the evening we have to meditate.

09:51.041 --> 09:53.250
We have to meditate both the times

09:53.500 --> 09:56.375
otherwise we cannot rise, we cannot grow.

09:56.625 --> 09:58.875
Just to think that "We are realized souls"

09:59.083 --> 10:00.417
you do not become.

10:00.667 --> 10:04.041
This cleansing has to be done every day,

10:04.250 --> 10:06.834
every day in an hour.

10:07.792 --> 10:11.542
And this is why none of the experiences which are described

10:11.792 --> 10:14.667
are felt sometimes in Sahaja Yoga

10:14.875 --> 10:16.208
and people ask

10:16.458 --> 10:19.125
"Mother, how it is that we don't feel the khechari?"

10:19.417 --> 10:22.000
Because your attention is not also

10:22.250 --> 10:24.417
there where it should have been.

10:24.792 --> 10:30.333
So one has to try to meditate in such a manner

10:30.542 --> 10:35.166
that it is working of the Kundalini is facilitated.

10:36.375 --> 10:39.208
The chakras are cleansed out

10:39.500 --> 10:44.417
and ultimately you are in a state of meditation.

10:45.250 --> 10:49.458
It's not a question of how to go into meditation,

10:54.417 --> 10:56.500
but is the question

10:58.083 --> 11:02.208
how to be in meditation all the time.

11:03.583 --> 11:06.750
So as you know that Kundalini, when she reaches

11:07.750 --> 11:09.750
the Agnya Chakra

11:09.959 --> 11:12.625
and when She opens Agnya chakra,

11:14.125 --> 11:18.417
then you can be in thoughtless awareness,

11:19.083 --> 11:22.208
then you don't think - thinking just stops.

11:22.417 --> 11:27.291
You watch everything, just watch,

11:27.999 --> 11:30.792
but you do not get involved into what you are watching,

11:30.999 --> 11:36.667
but you just watch and that watching itself

11:37.917 --> 11:40.959
gives you the growth within.

11:41.500 --> 11:46.125
Think of the tree which is, say, in a turmoil or

11:46.333 --> 11:50.333
during earthquake: it won't grow.

11:51.834 --> 11:53.750
When the earthquake stops,

11:53.959 --> 11:56.250
everything becomes quiet,

11:56.500 --> 11:58.000
everything is peaceful,

11:58.208 --> 11:59.999
then only the tree can grow.

12:00.166 --> 12:03.166
In the same way, our growth can only take place

12:03.417 --> 12:06.041
if we are peaceful within ourselves.

12:06.875 --> 12:12.125
So for a Kundalini growing wider and wider

12:12.375 --> 12:14.625
and rising higher and higher,

12:14.834 --> 12:16.583
first thing is we must have

12:16.792 --> 12:18.999
peace within ourselves,

12:20.208 --> 12:23.250
but this peace is possible if you can make really

12:23.500 --> 12:25.000
peace with others.

12:25.750 --> 12:28.083
If you cannot make peace with others

12:28.291 --> 12:30.667
who are in Sahaja Yoga,

12:30.999 --> 12:32.750
who are in the collective,

12:32.999 --> 12:37.208
if you are in a turmoil, this Kundalini can never rise.

12:37.792 --> 12:41.375
That is why collectivity is so important.

12:41.999 --> 12:45.625
Without collectivity your Vishuddhi cannot open,

12:46.375 --> 12:48.208
and without collectivity

12:48.458 --> 12:53.000
you cannot have the growth of your spirituality.

12:54.917 --> 12:56.999
It's the growth of the spirituality

12:57.208 --> 13:01.166
as they say the Tree of Life is upside down

13:01.375 --> 13:04.166
and the roots are in the brain,

13:04.500 --> 13:08.792
and this Kundalini has to go and water that brain,

13:10.458 --> 13:12.999
as we water the roots.

13:13.250 --> 13:15.792
Then it starts growing downward

13:15.999 --> 13:18.583
and that's how you start expanding.

13:18.792 --> 13:21.583
When you start expanding, then you touch

13:21.834 --> 13:23.834
the depth of your divinity.

13:24.041 --> 13:26.709
And once you have touched the depth of your divinity,

13:26.959 --> 13:31.625
then you start working it out in such a manner

13:31.834 --> 13:35.917
that people will know that you are yogiji:

13:36.083 --> 13:38.999
you are people of higher realm,

13:39.166 --> 13:41.041
you have something great.

13:41.291 --> 13:45.417
It's not how many times you read something,

13:45.625 --> 13:48.417
it's not how many times you talk about Sahaja Yoga,

13:48.667 --> 13:51.333
it's not even how many times

13:51.542 --> 13:53.875
you just go on reciting names;

13:54.291 --> 13:58.041
but how many times from your heart

13:58.417 --> 14:01.458
your pure desire is to ascend.

14:01.709 --> 14:04.667
If this pure desire cuts upon you,

14:04.917 --> 14:07.083
then the first thing and the last thing you'll do

14:07.333 --> 14:10.375
is to meditate - you can't do without it.

14:10.959 --> 14:12.999
Even if you try, you can't do without it.

14:13.208 --> 14:17.000
If you will sleep without meditating, you'll think: "Oh,

14:17.583 --> 14:19.959
I have not meditated" - not out of guilt,

14:20.125 --> 14:21.959
but "I have missed something,

14:22.208 --> 14:23.291
I have missed something."

14:23.625 --> 14:25.208
That should happen to us.

14:25.458 --> 14:28.917
So this power of Gauri has to be respected

14:29.125 --> 14:31.000
because she's our mother,

14:31.291 --> 14:33.166
she's our individual mother.

14:33.417 --> 14:35.750
She has given us second birth.

14:35.999 --> 14:39.250
She is the one who knows all about us;

14:39.458 --> 14:41.875
she's so gentle, so kind.

14:42.083 --> 14:44.166
How she slowly rises.

14:44.417 --> 14:45.834
She doesn't give us trouble;

14:46.000 --> 14:48.166
she takes all the trouble of penetrating

14:48.417 --> 14:52.208
through these centers and she gives us this second birth.

14:54.792 --> 14:56.959
Because she understands everything,

14:57.125 --> 15:00.166
she knows everything, she organizes everything,

15:00.417 --> 15:05.250
she brings forth all the beauty that you are.

15:05.500 --> 15:08.750
Once you start developing that beauty within yourself,

15:09.166 --> 15:11.917
then you'll be surprised how powerful you are;

15:12.125 --> 15:15.999
that all these things are of the same nature

15:16.166 --> 15:18.125
is the truth that you discover,

15:18.417 --> 15:24.208
is the same as the beauty, is the same as the joy.

15:24.583 --> 15:27.333
You don't have to think that joy is separate,

15:27.625 --> 15:29.792
truth is different, beauty is different.

15:30.041 --> 15:32.709
Because we are not yet at that point

15:32.917 --> 15:35.500
we just take one facet,

15:35.834 --> 15:38.875
but once we reach that point then

15:39.375 --> 15:42.583
the whole thing seems to be one.

15:42.959 --> 15:47.208
There is no differentiation at all.

15:47.625 --> 15:49.000
It's all one.

15:49.250 --> 15:51.709
Many facets of a diamond

15:51.959 --> 15:53.333
but it's one diamond

15:53.583 --> 15:57.250
and that diamond is your self, your spirit.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.125
So today is a very great day,

16:00.333 --> 16:02.625
we have to thank our, our Kundalini,

16:02.875 --> 16:05.583
the Gauri for giving us realization

16:05.834 --> 16:09.041
and to know that we have to every time awaken Her,

16:09.333 --> 16:11.709
every time we have to expand Her,

16:11.959 --> 16:14.333
and every time to worship Her

16:14.583 --> 16:19.709
so that we always keep our realization intact

16:19.959 --> 16:22.750
and keep our ascent intact.

16:23.041 --> 16:25.166
It is this ascent

16:25.417 --> 16:28.999
which is going to transform all the human beings.

16:29.667 --> 16:32.166
So you have to pray to Her that "keep us pure,

16:32.417 --> 16:34.792
make us pure." She purifies you,

16:34.999 --> 16:37.333
Her job is to purify your chakras,

16:37.542 --> 16:41.542
so "Please purify us, make our hearts clean,

16:41.750 --> 16:44.542
our minds clean, everything clean;

16:44.750 --> 16:46.375
and ultimately

16:46.583 --> 16:51.875
keep our connection forever and everlasting,

16:52.041 --> 16:56.083
so that we feel this beautiful power of God's love

16:56.291 --> 16:58.208
flowing through us."

16:58.458 --> 17:01.041
For that, whatever is necessary you will do.

17:01.333 --> 17:03.166
You will be very much in the collective,

17:03.375 --> 17:05.083
will sacrifice anything

17:05.333 --> 17:09.375
and also will try to be very sensible,

17:09.583 --> 17:11.375
will try to spread Sahaja Yoga,

17:11.583 --> 17:14.250
because when you spread Sahaja Yoga like a tree,

17:14.458 --> 17:16.999
then the depth will grow also.

17:17.417 --> 17:20.792
But it has to be done with the same beauty

17:20.999 --> 17:23.959
as the awakening of the Kundalini.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.959
She has not troubled you,

17:34.166 --> 17:37.875
she has not given any problems to you,

17:39.250 --> 17:42.583
so from that one has to learn

17:43.999 --> 17:49.625
that we have to behave in a manner

17:52.667 --> 17:55.999
the way Kundalini is so gentle,

17:56.500 --> 17:59.709
so sweet, so nice, so effective

17:59.917 --> 18:06.208
and she brings our life to some meaning.

18:06.625 --> 18:14.750
She completes the meaning of our life,

18:15.667 --> 18:18.917
she completes our desires

18:19.166 --> 18:20.959
and she takes us to a point

18:21.125 --> 18:23.208
where we start seeing the whole thing,

18:23.458 --> 18:26.125
the whole universe as one,

18:26.333 --> 18:28.166
all human beings as one.

18:28.417 --> 18:30.709
She gives us collective consciousness.

18:30.917 --> 18:34.999
All this work is done by Kundalini alone.

18:35.208 --> 18:39.917
Of course, if she does not go to any chakras

18:40.083 --> 18:42.166
and does not awaken any deity,

18:42.375 --> 18:44.291
we cannot even have the fruits

18:44.500 --> 18:46.250
of those chakras being awakened.

18:46.458 --> 18:49.875
So it is all her work, all her ascent,

18:50.041 --> 18:54.709
all her understanding and wisdom

18:54.917 --> 18:59.041
which has given us this beautiful state

18:59.291 --> 19:01.875
that we call ourselves as yogis.

19:02.250 --> 19:04.792
So I would request you all

19:05.000 --> 19:07.709
to pay attention to your Kundalini,

19:07.917 --> 19:09.583
try to raise her all the time,

19:09.792 --> 19:11.875
see that you get your vibrations.

19:12.041 --> 19:13.875
Also see that,

19:14.041 --> 19:16.542
not only that you get your vibrations all right,

19:16.792 --> 19:20.417
but also for others you have a different attitude.

19:20.625 --> 19:22.291
Do not criticize others,

19:22.500 --> 19:26.083
do not say anything about how wrong they are,

19:26.291 --> 19:27.959
but just see how right they are

19:28.125 --> 19:31.291
and what good they are capable of.

19:33.083 --> 19:37.500
She is a virgin and still so wise.

19:38.375 --> 19:42.333
In the same way we have to be very wise,

19:42.667 --> 19:44.875
very sensible.

19:45.250 --> 19:48.041
We cannot afford to waste our time now

19:48.250 --> 19:52.542
because we have to save the whole world -

19:52.750 --> 19:54.291
is our responsibility.

19:54.500 --> 19:57.750
If we do not now work out even our own chakras,

19:57.999 --> 19:59.959
we cannot help anyone.

20:00.166 --> 20:04.000
So first of all we must work out our own chakras,

20:04.208 --> 20:06.959
and then we can help the whole world.

20:07.125 --> 20:13.834
It's not something like a cult or an organization

20:14.000 --> 20:17.250
where you just say: "I belong to this cult or this organization.

20:17.458 --> 20:19.208
So it's all right, I'll be saved by God."

20:19.417 --> 20:22.166
That's not promised in Sahaja Yoga.

20:22.750 --> 20:25.875
There's nothing like a ticket to Heaven.

20:26.375 --> 20:28.291
It has to be worked out.

20:28.542 --> 20:31.208
You have to work it out, and work it out

20:31.417 --> 20:34.375
with full understanding as to what is

20:35.291 --> 20:39.500
this Kundalini is and how she works.

20:40.375 --> 20:42.542
May God bless you.

27:33.959 --> 27:37.083
Now the, it is the leaders have to wash My hands.

34:48.083 --> 34:49.417
Now we’ll have to have fourteen ladies –

34:49.667 --> 34:52.041
not seven or six, but at least eight ladies,

34:52.250 --> 34:56.250
if you can manage. How many married ladies are there?

35:17.250 --> 35:20.792
She will put the line for you, then we’ll start.

35:24.417 --> 35:26.250
It should be first going this way,

35:26.500 --> 35:29.625
because you have to put the line there…

38:34.625 --> 38:37.709
Shri Mataji, would you like us to sing “Hansata Ali”?

38:46.959 --> 38:50.417
I think sing one, one in between somewhere there,

38:50.750 --> 38:53.458
because she’s still dying that foot.

38:53.667 --> 39:00.875
Let’s sing this one, “Adi Ma” - “Adi Ma”.

39:01.542 --> 39:03.750
So come along now.

39:53.291 --> 39:57.041
From My purse just give the ….

41:51.166 --> 41:52.959
Now, what else ….

43:32.500 --> 43:35.166
May God bless you.

44:24.417 --> 44:26.083
The other way round, I think.

44:27.750 --> 44:30.458
All right? It’s all right.

46:37.875 --> 46:40.875
Will you read the Horoscope for them?

47:33.208 --> 47:40.625
Must clean up … Girls can wash it out with clean …

47:59.166 --> 48:03.709
Horoscope is read

48:04.291 --> 48:06.250
Dharmasthana.

48:46.250 --> 48:50.041
Dyankaraka - means that gives you the knowledge,

48:50.999 --> 48:52.834
knowledge on your central nervous system

48:53.041 --> 48:56.999
as well as knowledge on your mental level.

49:05.917 --> 49:08.291
“Different quantum”: quantum aunsha.

49:08.583 --> 49:11.583
Also means “part”, is quantum.

49:49.792 --> 49:50.834
And also it’s complete.

49:51.041 --> 49:53.417
They are saying that they’re aunsha Avatara.

49:53.625 --> 49:54.999
That means that’s part of Me.

49:55.208 --> 49:58.417
But in My case it’s all completed.

49:58.667 --> 50:01.583
I mean, it’s really fantastic …

50:25.875 --> 50:27.542
That’s like the cycle.

53:15.208 --> 53:20.000
Fifth, fifth - Sahasrara Day.

54:18.500 --> 54:20.542
That’s what I’m hoping.

54:49.125 --> 54:52.750
I was born also on Wednesday!

56:22.375 --> 56:24.667
Masses, must be.

56:36.083 --> 56:38.667
The last bit, you could read that …

56:44.834 --> 56:46.999
Yes, continue, continue.

57:24.083 --> 57:29.542
Nishkalanka - Kalki.  Nishkalanka. Nishkalankara.

57:38.583 --> 57:41.542
Is the incarnation of Nishkalanka.

58:14.583 --> 58:16.792
You will have to make copies of this.

58:16.999 --> 58:19.667
Maybe you’d better, everybody should have his own copy.

58:19.875 --> 58:23.959
Whenever they need it, then they can read it.
