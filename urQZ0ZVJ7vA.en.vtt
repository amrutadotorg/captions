00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.892
1984-0622 The Experience of Truth - Part 4, London, England

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.892
but we have further, if you go, there’s a mosque. What is that mosque?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.892
It’s called as Hazarat Bhal means one hair of Mohammed Sahib is kept in that place.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.892
I said really, just imagine! One hair of Mohammed Sahib was kept in that place

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.892
and I caught it up at least five miles away.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.892
So that you can imagine that hair may not be aware of the vibrations it has,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.892
but the one who is a human being and a realised soul gets the awareness five miles away from that hair,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.892
that there lies the hair of Mohammed Sahib.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.892
Now for this hair there has been big quarrel and fight and this and that and then it was replaced,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.892
all sorts of things, but ones who were fighting even for that do not know what it is.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:23.892
Just fighting for nothing at all. Like that you can see that those things which have got,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.892
we can say matter in it, same matter becomes a human being after sometime

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.892
through evolutionary process and the same thing which was just a matter

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.892
when it becomes a human being, becomes aware of those divine vibrations.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.892
Before that it can not, so we cancel out all the animals. I had a dog which used to vibrate,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.892
if anybody came used to say Mother what vibrations coming from this dog.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:08.892
And it used to feel if some man with nasty feelings or something would come in the house,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.892
he knew it was, so it used to bark on that.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.892
He knew many things but he was not aware that he had vibrations,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.892
he could not feel himself that he had vibrations.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.892
He kept a very good health and was a pedigree dog but the doctor said that

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.892
this dog is remarkable for his own pedigree, he’s too tall and too broad and very healthy you see,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.892
but because of the vibrations he kept up that kind of health.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.892
So one has to understand that you become the truth,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.892
means your awareness itself becomes aware of Divine.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.892
That your central nervous system, or you can say that your brain evolves to that state

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.892
that you can feel the vibrations. That’s one thing.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.892
Then you can not only feel the vibrations but you can discern them,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.892
you can find out whether these are good vibrations or bad vibrations.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.892
Then you can also say whether these vibrations are partial or full vibrations from the person,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.892
if the person has got some sort of a disease or a trouble,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.892
you can without knowing a word about medicine,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.892
you can say this person is suffering from such and such diseases.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.892
Imagine the computer that we are, we are really the greatest computer

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.892
that anybody can produce. Human beings can’t produce this computer.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.892
The one they have produced is just a copy of this which is not such a great copy also,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.892
because this computer sees something and knows this is this, it doesn’t think.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.892
Can you think of a computer which doesn’t think?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.892
Just without thinking it knows, And that’s the computer we are.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.892
Now this great computer of our brain which just sees and knows, feels and knows,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.892
smells and knows, this special computer becomes a greater,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.892
we can say subtler instrument which knows the divine, which feels the divine,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.892
which understands the divine and can manoeuvre it,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.892
it can manoeuvre it. For example. A person has got some problem,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.892
he is suffering from some disease, take it, he knows how to cure himself,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.892
also he knows how to cure that person.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.892
Now don’t many people who say that we are doing, they are healers,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.892
some people heal also, but it can be very dangerous with these healers,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.892
because these healers are not the people who have any knowledge about the divine.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.892
Some of them could be realised souls, could be,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.892
but they do not know what they are doing, what they have to do and some of them,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.892
most of them are not the ones who are realised souls,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.892
they are the people who use a kind of a spirit.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.892
Like in this England, here in London we had one hospital once upon a time,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.892
called late Doctor Langs Hospital, called as Doctor Langs International Hospital

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.892
or something like that. Now this doctor was dead

00:05:50.000 --> 00:06:01.892
and he manifested into a soldier somewhere in Vietnam and told him that you go and see my son.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.892
And when he came to see the son,. the son said “How do you say that my father is in you?”

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.892
He said. “I’ll tell you the secret talks you had with your father” and he talked to him,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.892
he was amazed. Now he said your father wants me to start a clinic.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.892
So he said “Are you a doctor?” He said “No I’m not a doctor,”

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:30.892
but he said there are many doctors who have died without expressing their skill,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.892
so they would like to help and we should start this clinic.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.892
So the boy agreed and they started a clinic. Now see the father did not posses the boy

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.892
but he did posses another healthy person in Vietnam; where he got a shock,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.892
and he possessed him and then they started their healing process.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.892
So, actually I came to know about them because there was one lady in India who came to me

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.892
and she came to see me because she was suffering from horrible nervous trouble

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.892
and she came before me she was shaking before me just like this, so I said. “What’s this?”

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.892
She said. “This is my nervous trouble.” Then she told me that

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.892
she had some ulcer in her stomach and she had some problem with her ulcer

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.892
and she knew about this Doctor Langs International thing from someone.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.892
So she wrote to him saying that please cure me and one day she was just resting in her bed,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.892
they told her that on such and such a day you rest in your bed and such and such a point,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.892
that we’ll cure you. And she felt this shaking in her body,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.892
the whole shaking came to her as a shock because they didn’t tell that you’ll be shaking.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.892
And after the shaking stopped her ulcer was cured and she felt very much better,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.892
but as the time passed within three years time she discovered that she’s a very nervous woman.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.892
She got frightened of everything and she used to shake and at a very young age

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.892
and her whole body started shaking. And doctors couldn’t understand what sort of a disease is this.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.892
Now this kind of thing can be also so called healing,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.892
but the healing has to have an intelligent answer, after realisation.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.892
Supposing we say Sahaja Yoga can heal cancer,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.892
then we should be able to tell a doctor how we have cured the person of this trouble,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.892
it’s not just I have touched a person and I’ve cured. Yes it has happened that way,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.892
it may happen but that doesn’t mean that there is no explanation for it.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.892
There has to be an intelligent explanation, that on such an such centre we found

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:45.892
that it was exhausted, and when this exhausted centre was triggered by some entity,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.892
then the cancer took place, and what we have done is to put back the centre.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.892
Now the doctor would be surprised because he will be surprised to know

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.892
that we know exactly where the cancer is, we know exactly how to put it right,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.892
and we can give a full explanation to him, from what plexus it has happened,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.892
and what it has gone, he will be surprised.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.892
Then if you give realisation to that doctor, he gets realisation

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.892
and then he himself can cure other people, he can cure himself also,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.892
but it has to have an intelligent explanation.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.892
This is what the truth becomes when you become a realised soul.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.892
If a person is a realised soul, he sees truth so directly and that he can explain it

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.892
so the people can understand what he is going to say and what he is meaning.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:48.892
Its not something ambiguous. For example, now in the Bible we have a word called Holy Ghost.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.892
Now we can say that “Holy Ghost” is a word which we can not explain

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.892
because if we just read Bible you can not understand the Holy Ghost,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.892
because Christ or Holy Ghost are like oceans and you cannot just put it in one little cup

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.892
and say that this is it, and beyond this is nothing.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.892
You have to go beyond it to see there are many cups filled with the knowledge

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.892
and you have to see all of them and find out what is the meaning of the word Holy Ghost,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.892
in other scriptures also. And when you find the similarity between the two,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.892
then you are surprised that this is what Holy Ghost is.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.892
But when we just take Bible as everything you see,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.892
then I have seen people making Bible so small as that, putting in the golden box,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.892
hanging it here. Imagine! It is absolutely absurd.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.892
Bible is to be respected no doubt, it has great knowledge in it

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.892
but as the Bible itself I feel is a microscopic thing, is very microscopic every word is microscopic

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.892
and to go into it’s details and all that you must first get realisation

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.892
and get explanation from other places, other dictionaries which can explain it better.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.892
But when we stick on to one sort of thing, then we are flabbergasted,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.892
like other day we had a controversy about Christ and I told you very frankly

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.892
that Paul is all wrong, he is not a realised soul at all and he doesn’t understand God,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.892
he doesn’t understand religion. And that is what, is when the truth comes to you,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.892
you see everything clearly and all the people, truth being absolute say the same thing.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.892
Take Kahil Gibran, he says the same thing, take your William Blake, in England,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.892
any one you take they say the same thing because there is no difference of opinion

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.892
as far as the truth is concerned, if you are facing the truth.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.892
And the trouble is when you are a human being you can be, also dishonest.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.892
Supposing even if you see that this microscope is placed before me, all right.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.892
Then a person who is not a realised soul can tell a lie also, there was no microscope,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.892
can tell but not a realised soul.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.892
And a person who is possessed may not even see a microscope.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.892
You will be surprised some don’t see me, they see the light, if they are possessed,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.892
their eyes are possessed, if somebody is a drunk fellow he may not even see me,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:28.892
he just walks over me like that. So the awareness before realisation can be blurred

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.892
and there for a simple truthful thing as you see with your own eyes there can be aberrations

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.892
there can be other explanations and other descriptions.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.892
But after realisation the basic truth never changes.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.892
You may say in a poetic way like Paul has said this;

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.892
Paul seems to be a strange man to me,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.892
I may say that he was not honest or somebody may say something

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:07.892
but the truth about Paul is the same but those who are not realised souls will not understand.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.892
They have built big churches in his name, people are going to the church,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.892
now people are flabbergasted, they don’t know what to do,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.892
they have built up the churches in the name of the Christ, everything,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.892
and denies the miracles of Christ, so now what to do?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.892
They are lost. They don’t know how to get over this feeling of frustration,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.892
that they love Christ so much, they adored him

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.892
and they thought him to be such a great personality that The Son of God,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.892
and then now suddenly to say that he has no miracles.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.892
You get a shock, but don’t believe them. Don’t believe them because Christ was a Son of God,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.892
no doubt about it. But how can you explain,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.892
when you just read Bible you cannot see, and then Paul, this Paul who was he?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.892
He should not have been there, he is not a Christian in anyway,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.892
because he had never seen Christ.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:08.892
So this kind of a challenge, only a person who is a realised soul can put it and all realised souls

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.892
will stand by with that person, they’ll have the same voice about it.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.892
Whether you go to the antiquities or you go in the future

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.892
any time a realised soul will come he will say the same thing.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.892
That’s why there is so much similarity, I should say the unity,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.892
in all these people whether it is Lao Tse, or whether it is Mohammed Sahib

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.892
or whether it is Raja Janaka Or Nanakaa they say the same thing.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.892
Now where is the difference that comes in?

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.892
Also we see very clearly when the truth is your own.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:46.892
The difference comes that these incarnations came for a different type of a job.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.892
Like Moses came to establish the void, as we say here, in the centre.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.892
All these Primordial masters came to do that.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.892
So their job was, like we can say like Guru Nanak,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.892
or all these people who were Primordial masters came on this Earth to establish the balance

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.892
and that’s why whatever they have said, all have said the same thing.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.892
Then came Rama. Supposing Rama came on this earth,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.892
he came here to establish the benevolent king.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:25.892
What is a benevolent king, the idea of a benevolent king, so he talks differently,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.892
then came say Krishna. Krishna came to establish the truth

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:40.892
that you have to ascend first and secondly he came to show that the world is just a play of God.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.892
Then came Christ, now Christ came on this earth

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:51.892
to create a full awareness within us that we are the spirit.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:59.892
So the accent of their preaching has been for the purpose they have come.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.892
For example I have to give realisation to people,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.892
I have to raise the Kundalini and I have to explain all of them and integrate them

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.892
so I have to talk about all of them.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.892
But my task is easier because there are sensible people in these days,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.892
but when Christ lived, what sort of people lived there, absolutely cruel, violent, nonsensical.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.892
Mohammed sahib had a very bad time, Guru Nanak had a very bad time,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.892
none of them have such a nice time that I am having.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.892
None of you are going to crucify me.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.892
So you must understand that the truth when it comes to a person like that,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.892
not only that he knows but he can make others also know,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:49.892
this is what William Blake has said. That at this time men of God, that’s you people,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.892
will become Prophets and they will have powers to make others Prophets.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.892
So people sometimes say why didn’t happened earlier?  No that was not the time,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.892
now the blossom time has come, so it is happening.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.892
Then you see the truth in its full extent.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.892
Like at that time this was the situation, today this is the situation and according to the situation

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.892
or the development of tree of life the work is done.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.892
This is what one has to understand, the complete comprehensive idea

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.892
about the spiritual growth of human beings. Unless until you have that kind of an idea,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.892
whatever you have, is like a person is saying that the flower is the tree,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.892
somebody saying that the leaf is the tree, and they are fighting.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.892
Everything is the tree, everything is needed for the tree.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:53.892
So when you understand through your self realisation, that truth is what it is.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.892
We can not change it. So you become the truth and strength of truth comes in you

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.892
and then you’re not afraid of anything. You say it out, loudly.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.892
You say this is the truth, I know this is the truth. People may not accept it, they may crucify you,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:19.892
what they like, but truth is truth and that truth remains for ever and ever, it is eternal.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.892
But this brain that we do not think much of becomes aware of the truth,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.892
this is the blessing of the truth upon us which comes to us

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.892
through our self-realisation or we say through our spirit.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.892
There can be complete seven lectures on truth if I go on but,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.892
I think I have to see to the other side of it, what else it does.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.892
Another thing happens to you is your attention.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:55.892
Now our attention is out side, the reason is our brain has become like a prism

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.892
and the rays that come into us of awareness also are thrown out

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.892
and as a reaction our attention goes outside.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.892
If I tell you take your attention inside you can not take it, just cannot,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.892
something has to happen inside and that’s why when this Kundalini rises within you,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.892
then your attention is attracted inside

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.892
and this happening takes place and then you find that you can enter inside as well as outside,

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.892
but otherwise you cannot. Many people say that we are praying,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.892
now you are praying outside, there is no connection.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.892
First the connection must be established.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.892
So when your attention is outside you react to everything.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.892
For example I come and see these flowers, then I react to it and then I say something,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.892
or another thing I see all the time I am reacting outside.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.892
As a result of all the kind of sensations we get out of our reactions

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.892
our attention becomes absolutely disturbed and we get into lot of troubles.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.892
First of all our eyes are not steady, they go on hovering from here to there,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.892
God knows what are we looking for.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.892
The eyes become impure because we start thinking about things,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.892
as soon as we see something we start thinking and barrier is created.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.892
For example there is a beautiful piece, something very beautiful you see,

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.892
and looking at it if there is a thought you can not enjoy it,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.892
but if there’s no thought, there’s pure rapport, pure connection

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.892
between that beautiful art and yourself,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.892
then you just see it and enjoy that joy of the artist which he has poured into it,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.892
without thinking about it, otherwise normally people will think oh how many pounds can I save?

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.892
Or what should I do? Should I purchase it or not?

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.892
All sorts of nonsensical flippant, cheap ideas can come into your head,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.892
or could be something higher also, this colour is not matched with that and this,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.892
but a person who’s a realised soul will just see.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.892
Just like children, they just look, in the same way, without thinking.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.892
So the first thing that happens to your attention, that the thoughts subside.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:19.892
Thought is the first problem that has started with ego and now when the thoughts subside,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.892
then you become peaceful. People talk of peace, we should have peace,

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.892
how can you have peace? It is not possible, is an impossible situation.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.892
You see we think by thinking by organising by manipulating, we’ll have peace, you cannot.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.892
You cannot have peace that way? How will you have peace?

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.892
When the peace is established on your attention, when your attention is peaceful,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.892
when we are absolutely without any thoughts, then the peace is resides.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.892
After all the peace is disturbed by human beings only, isn’t it?

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.892
It is not disturbed by something else is disturbed by the human beings.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.892
And now if the human beings are not peaceful how can you have peace by talks?

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.892
On the contrary when there are talks be sure that there will be some violent action after that,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:20.892
always it happens, because thought is incapable of keeping your attention in balance.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.892
Now how do you remove the thought from your mind is the problem.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.892
Thoughts are all the time in your mind, if you get possessed you may not have thoughts,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.892
but otherwise which is the other way?

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.892
The other way is the Kundalini when it rises, a thought rises and falls off

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.892
and another thought rises and falls off,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.892
but when the Kundalini rises, then what happens, these thoughts become elongated

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.892
and starts some work inside and there is gap in-between

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.892
and this gap is place of our peace.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.892
If you achieve that peace the world peace can be achieved.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.892
By just taking placards, by shouting for peace, you can not establish peace.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.892
Peace has to come from the hearts of human beings,

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.892
in the hearts of human beings peace can be only established when you establish the spirit within

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.892
it’s core, where it manifests the bliss of peace.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.892
When you start enjoying the bliss of peace you don’t want wars, you don’t think of a wars

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.892
and that is the state where now the human beings have to rise and go to that.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.892
So these horrible times which we call as Kali yuga, the modern times

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:41.892
which are the times of complete illusion and when all the value system is changed,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.892
where everybody seems to be unhappy and sick,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:54.892
is the time also preceding the Kruthayuga, the time where everything will be done,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.892
perfected and established. That’s the meaning of Kruthayuga.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.892
So to begin with primitive times which were called Kritta yuga are established again

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.892
the primitive is again established,

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.892
but here with the awareness, like as I told you the matter becomes aware of itself.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.892
The Kundalini which is a potential thing, which is a potential power of desire within us,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:30.892
which is we can solve the primitive, manifests itself and becomes aware itself.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.892
That is what is Sahaja Yoga today,

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.892
it’s all Sahaja, it’s all spontaneous all life process has been spontaneous,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.892
but today that is what it is.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.892
So spontaneously our attention becomes peaceful, absolutely peaceful,

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:55.892
and when that peace is achieved, that peace is established within your heart through the ascent,

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.892
then every bit of that peace emits peace.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:08.892
Such a person wherever he is, he emits peace, wherever he is, if there is quarrel going on,

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.892
there will be peace. Even we have seen if there one person who is a realised soul in a train,

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.892
and if there is an accident everybody is saved, even one person.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.892
There are many examples where, in a bus there was one lady who was a realised soul

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.892
and the bus fell down with three somersaults and fell on its four legs

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.892
and everybody was safe and the thing started and they tried to find out

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.892
who was the realised soul, because in India we understand these things.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.892
We are more grown up in spiritual sensitivity than in the material sensitivity.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.892
You are very sensitive to material things we should also learn something from you I should say,

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.892
but you should also learn something from us and that is the spiritual sensitivity.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.892
To understand what serenity is and what superficiality is.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.892
So with this attention being absolutely stationed on a balance,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.892
you start seeing the superficiality and you start discarding the superficiality.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.892
You immediately see that this is superficial there’s nothing in it

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.892
and then the attention only accepts whatever is deep, whatever is divine.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.892
The rest of it is rejected, it doesn’t accept, it doesn’t react, it doesn’t say anything about it,

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.892
it doesn’t accept, it has nothing to do with it, it just separated.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.892
The attention keeps a distance from all superficial things, it has no enjoyment.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:41.892
I have seen many Sahaja Yogis, who are here today, who used to indulge in all kinds of things,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.892
all kinds of things which I was amazed. How could they go, because they were Men of God.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.892
But this situation is such, the atmosphere is such, that they were, like that.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.892
They had given up their parents, they had given up everything

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.892
and had really become like vagabonds I should say,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.892
but when they got their realisation they settled down, everything settled down.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.892
And now they know they don’t go to those places now, they just don’t like it,

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.892
they don’t want to see it on the TV. If it’s on the TV, they put it off,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:18.892
because the attention has now the sense, the sense I would say, of purity.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.892
The sense of morality, which morality which we know of is hypocrisy outside.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.892
We are hypocritical but this is inner morality which just keep you moral.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.892
Inner quality, like Christ now, he would not do something filthy, will he?

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.892
Why didn’t do anything like any other person

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.892
why he was not attracted to something that was not good;

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.892
because his attention was pure; it would not accept anything that was not pure.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.892
Like that your attention becomes absolutely pure, your eyes become innocent,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.892
your eyes do not have dirty ideas, lust and greed, but they have purity in them.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.892
And wherever you put your eyes that becomes purer,

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.892
wherever you look that becomes purer and you spread purity through your eyes,

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.892
not lust and greed.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.892
And this is something must happen today because the time has come our eyes are tired,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.892
now tired of looking at all horrible things.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.892
Let us now have those eyes who discard. Then why will they have dirty things?

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.892
It’s only we have created this filth, once we discard it, it will all disappear, its our own creation.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.892
Whom can we blame? Not the birds have done it, nor the tigers have done it,

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.892
or the trees have done it, it’s we the human beings, we have done all this nonsense.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.892
If we get purified everything will be purified.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:58.892
Now the attention becomes, the attention becomes collectively conscious, becomes.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.892
So far your attention is not. Your attention is, you can see a person,

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.892
how his hair is or what dress he is wearing and all these things,

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:14.892
but you can not penetrate into that person to feel what sort of trouble that person has,

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.892
what centre he’s catching, whether he is a good man or a bad man,

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.892
from the divine point of view.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.892
Because your attention has achieved that state of collective consciousness you can understand,

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.892
at a very sight of the person you can say what sort of a person he is.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.892
I mean I have many experiences like that I told once my husband,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.892
that this man has came to loot our country and he was shocked. He said.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.892
How do you pass such a remark, just looking at his face?

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.892
I said he has came to loot our country, and he did it, he did it, within three years time

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.892
and we found out that he looted us out, like that, we can have many people

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:02.892
who are really are at the top of organisations, Governments, this, that, are really cheats.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.892
Are going to one day ruin the whole country or destroy us completely,

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.892
you can see it from the face of it, but that penetration can come only when

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.892
you have those pure eyes, When you are yourself impure how can you see it?

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.892
When your glasses mirror, supposing there is a, your eyes are covered with some colour,

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.892
then how can you see? To see something clearly your eyes must be clear and clean,

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.892
and that’s what happens to us, but there’s nothing wrong,

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.892
once the Kundalini rises he kindles a light, you can see a twinkle in the eyes of a person

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:46.892
who is a realised soul, their eyes are twinkling, and there’s a kind of a light,

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.892
you can see in the eyes of such a person

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.892
and then you know that a such a person is a realised soul.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.892
It’s very simple to make out even the eyes of a bad man and good person

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.892
when you develop your own inner sensitivity

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.892
and this comes through the attention being absolutely at balance,

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.892
no thoughts, rising you look at a person without any barrier.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.892
For example, you see, say I see an Indian and immediately I think,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.892
oh from what country and what part of the country, then who is he, this that, supposing.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.892
So that’s he’s lost that it’s nothing important, what is important is,

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.892
what sort of a person he is He may be your own brother, may be a nasty fellow tomorrow

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.892
he may murder you So it does not matter whatever you have understood through your brain,

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:50.892
is not important, what is important if you are seeing through and through what sort of a person he is.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.892
So the attention has to be purified,

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.892
but that you don’t have to do your Kundalini itself purifies your attention,

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.892
you become collectively conscious, so many things happen to your attention.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.892
Sitting down here you can tell about people, what’s happening to them.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.892
Now the Kritta Yuga means it happens, it is manifested,

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.892
so now the attention manifests itself, it’s another very remarkable thing has happens.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.892
Like I’m sitting here now and I’m thinking of someone, all right,

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.892
I’m thinking of someone, if I want I can think, if I don’t want I need not think, that is the situation,

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.892
but after realisation somebody needs your help, you’ll just think of that person

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.892
and if you think of that person, that person is helped.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.892
Even if the person doesn’t know and he’s thinking of God,

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.892
you may help that person just thinking of him. It happens,

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:56.892
it has happened you must have seen one of these things happened in Bedford is very surprising for people but it’s a fact.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.892
The fact is like this, that some people were going, no,

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.892
one boy See extract from Bedfordshire Journal: Appendix (a) was going on a motor cycle

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.892
and he fell down from a bridge and they called for the ambulance,

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.892
but after some time the boy himself got up and came up

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.892
and they were surprised because they expected him to be dead you see,

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.892
they were surprised how did he walk up.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.892
So they asked him, he said, there was, no I’ll tell you in the hospital;

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.892
they took him to the hospital and there was also police people and he told them that

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.892
I fell down all right, but a lady came in a white car,

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.892
I have a white car, and she came down and she healed me.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.892
They said which lady, he said an Indian lady, she was wearing a white sari,

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.892
they could not believe, said this must be an hallucination.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.892
Next day he saw my photograph, because I was speaking in Bedford at that time

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.892
when he fell down like this, we had a bigger hall than this

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.892
and I was speaking there when this had happened.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:04.892
So they were quite surprised and he said that a little point down below is left there,

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:15.892
she said you come to me and I’ll cure it. …….

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.892
But it’s nothing great it’s nothing special

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:25.892
because if you can receive on the television something from the ether,

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.892
you can always receive at that level also and you can manifest them,

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.892
but in the television what we receive is, it doesn’t manifest

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:42.892
supposing we see some photograph of someone, it doesn’t get up and cure us does it?

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:49.892
It does not, but here attention when you put to it, the attention manifests,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.892
see how fantastic it is. It is very hard to believe but it happens,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.892
it happens, that the attention itself manifests.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.892
So this attention that becomes enlightened becomes one with the divine,

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:14.892
it manifests and it acts and it helps. It is very miraculous.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.892
But now those who are Sahaja Yogis here know a thousand and one stories about it,

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:25.892
it has happened like that, it can happen to you, it can happen to anyone of you.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.892
Like once I remember a girl, she went to a place

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.892
which was a little lonely and some people attacked her

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.892
and some Sahaja Yogis were going by bus, so they just suddenly got down at a place

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.892
and just walked, they didn’t know why they walked there

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.892
and they found that so many people were attacking this girl and they just saved the girl from there.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.892
And they were from a different place and she said how are you all here?

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.892
Oh we don’t know we just felt we should walk this side, so we came,

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.892
we just felt the vibrations we just came walked here, and we saw you in this condition.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.892
It can happen that way, so you become one unit, one unit.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.892
Like the part and parcel of the body.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:15.892
So you become the attention, makes you a part and parcel of the whole body,

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:22.892
but also the awareness of it, like this big finger, is part and parcel of the whole body;

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.892
but is not aware, is not aware that it is part and parcel of the whole body.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:35.892
It acts but there it is aware and it acts without even having any connection outside

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:45.892
like ductless glands it acts and it manifests and it works out the way it has to work out.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.892
It’s such a fantastic thing is the attention that becomes.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:58.892
Then the last and the most important thing is that you become the joy.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.892
Nowadays we have lost the sense of joy.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.892
With the smallest thing we get irritated and angry.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.892
You see the small children running “you should not run here I am disturbed”.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.892
I mean children when they run and the sound they make, so sweet,

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.892
so beautiful, so joy giving, but she can’t bear she’s so tense,

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.892
she’s just waiting to hear, she comes down, there’s one child, she shouts at the child,

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.892
the child cannot even speak, why are you shouting at the child,

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.892
he makes noise he can’t talk, oh then she goes back.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:44.892
All the time you are just waiting to find faults with others, waiting to complain,

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.892
waiting to see what others are doing wrong, not enjoying them at all.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.892
Once I was travelling from Luknow to Delhi in a train

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.892
and we had ladies compartment and we were four ladies,

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.892
but there was only one lady with me and myself and in the other compartment

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.892
there were two young boys and they had met after a long time

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.892
I think they were in college together. And they were hitting each other

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.892
and you know talking with each other you know in such a friendly manner,

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.892
I was just enjoying you know and this lady was so angry,

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.892
she said these stupid fools don’t allow me to sleep,

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.892
I said we sleep every time enjoy the way they are having,

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.892
she said what you are enjoying really enjoying, I am feeling my young age has come,

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.892
and hitting each other and you come along now, what is it this way and that,

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.892
is so interesting such innocent talk they were having, this lady got so infuriated,

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:41.892
and she said no, she said no I’m going to hit them hard,

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:42.892
I said you cant so that, at the most she knocked ten times she knocked I said why are you knocking let it be,

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.892
I am enjoying, so she said no, no I just can’t manage I can’t, then she went out,

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.892
her attention you see would just not allow her to sleep.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.892
She went out shouted at them “ what do you mean by doing like this

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.892
and what do you mean by talking like this”, poor things you know like this,

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.892
I felt so sad, so when she went away, I went and told them doesn’t matter you know

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.892
she’s still her ears are very very sharp you see,

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.892
so when you talk, talk in muffled voices she wont know, but even that she could hear,

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.892
she would not spare them, the whole night you see she didn’t sleep just hearing, are they talking?

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.892
She asked me, don’t you think they’re talking? Now better sleep.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.892
That’s how our attention is, horrible, it can never enjoy anyone.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:38.892
What the birds sing, how the children run and how the people talk, you see enjoy,

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.892
it’s so enjoyable everything is such an enjoyment which we have lost, that sensitivity completely.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:52.892
We cannot enjoy each other but then we enjoy, we just enjoy the person who is a realised soul,

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.892
just sitting with a person, nobodies talking, many a time we Sahaja Yogis travelling together,

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.892
there’s a pin drop silence nobody’s talking and the ticket collector said

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.892
why are you meditating or what, nobody’s talking just sitting enjoying,

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.892
he can’t understand and what’s the matter with these people their not talking,

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.892
nobody talking just enjoying each other, just sitting enjoying the company,

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.892
then nobody bothers about the comfort.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.892
You know sometimes we have our programs where we have thousand people or something

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.892
and also sometimes we go to India, it’s horrible spartan living,

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.892
absolutely spartan to the last we can say,

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.892
and they don’t mind at all and they don’t mind anything.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.892
I said you want to go to the villages but be prepared it’s a horrible place.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.892
Oh no, no Mother we enjoy. They said our Kundalini rises,

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.892
it just goes boom in India and we just enjoy that, we don’t want anything else and it is so difficult

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.892
for them to send them to send back to their own country that you actually push them with a pistol,

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.892
now go back. And they enjoy all the discomfort in that country

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.892
I was surprised absolutely most uncomfortable places there.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.892
But we had four Americans once and three of them ran away, they couldn’t bear it,

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:02.000
they said Mother its too much. and we had to force them,

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:11.892
we said we have to stick them with something and they stick on here but they would not.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.892
They said, no mother it’s too much for us, how can we live like that.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.892
I said what comforts you have in your country, you see all plastics, you eat in plastic,

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:26.892
everything plastic, even for towels you have plastic at least in India you have everything cotton.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.892
You have a plate of say, a beautiful plate of brass to eat food,

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.892
what do you have in your country that you are talking of your comfort

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.892
and they got a little bit I said at least we have motor cars, all right

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:44.892
we have got bullock carts doesn’t matter but it is too much for them to go by a bullock cart

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.892
because you see their body is all shaken up and their attention all outside you see.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.892
So this is what happens your attention becomes balanced,

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.892
attention becomes collectively conscious you start enjoying others

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.892
and this so called comfort which we really vie is zero.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.892
Like here I see if you go to Yorkshire you find people have gone to Brighton. Why?

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.892
For a holiday and the people from Brighton have came to Yorkshire for a holiday.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.892
I said. But why? I can’t understand they can’t sit in the house you see nothing like a Grahasta,

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.892
means the one who stays in the house is there,

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.892
there’s nothing like a householder they are always out,

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.892
out of the house as soon as they get holiday they must pack up and go out,

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.892
some people are just cruising. Why? Why are you cruising?

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.892
You must sit at home, home is the place of bliss, sit down,

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.892
talk together and have some rapport, be nice to each other.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.892
That’s not there you will have a television in between you,

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.892
otherwise if there is no television there is a fight.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.892
Nobody can stand the company of another person even for five minutes either

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.892
you have television or a newspaper or something in between.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.892
There’s nothing like enjoying the company of another person. Why?

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.892
Because our attention is so shaky, it just gets disturbed for nothing at all,

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.892
I mean how can you live in a place, in any place without any sound?

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.892
You want to have a soundless area then why God as given you ears?

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.892
See He has given you the ears to enjoy the music of his rhythm and that you can only feel

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.892
when you become a realised soul before that you are very uncomfortable,

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:35.892
you have all kinds of wrinkles all over, and you ask them why have you got wrinkles?

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.892
Oh God, you know I have neighbours who are young boys, they are all the time singing loudly,

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.892
I will grow old in no time. I said I would go and join them if it was so,

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.892
what is there to feel so bad about it? What is there to feel that you cannot bear it?

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.892
You see, why should you be so tired about it?

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.892
Because our attention makes us tired all the time our attention is,

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.892
and the worst is our attention is on the watch. Watching the time, for what?

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.892
For what are you watching the time, there is no more going to be a war of Waterloo anything.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.892
You don’t have to worry on that point, when the bomb will come, it will come without knowing;

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.892
so why watch the time? After all that’s the only thing that is important isn’t it,

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:26.892
otherwise what is important, is enjoy the time, this moment, every moment has a dynamism in it.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.892
But you are thinking, now to go, now Mother is speaking, whether I’ll get my train or not,

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.892
I should look at my watch now as soon as time is I’ll run.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.892
But I tell you for a Sahaja Yogi the trains will stop, the aeroplanes will stop;

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.892
everything stops for them. Because after all its all God’s realm you are entering into.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.892
Who is greater than God, who is more powerful than Him,

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:52.892
once you enter into His Kingdom everything works out, you know it works out.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.892
Mother we don’t know how it worked out, it works out.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.892
They talk in third person, it works out.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:07.892
So the joy of those happenings, the joy of that blissfullness,

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.892
that security of God, fills you up and when it fills you up

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:19.892
you feel absolutely relaxed. You feel it’s all done for you.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.892
Now the gentleman has gone you need not look at him, actually when he was sitting

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.892
he was having big things and it happens with people,

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.892
because I think he’s a possessed person and with me sitting here sometimes you know,

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.892
they go into contortions and do all kinds of things, better that he’s gone.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.892
But you don’t pay attention to him, he’s nothing important, there’s no need to turn your eyes.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.892
Just now were talking something nice, lets talk of something nice,

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.892
why put the attention to something that’s not so nice.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:53.892
So attention should be at the nice things as we say but it is never. How do we do?

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.892
We do it by enjoying the nice things, by understanding the nice things,

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.892
just our attention goes there and whatever else may be there we just don’t see, we just don’t see.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:13.892
We once went to a place called Nepal, you must have heard about Nepal and Kathmandu

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.892
and my daughters were there with me and normally Indian people are a little bit,

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.892
sort of you see with daughters, they would not carry them to places

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.892
if there are erotics and all that, actually we had never seen erotics in all our lives you see

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.892
because our attention is not there.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.892
So we saw the whole of Nepal we never saw any erotics you see,

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.892
second time I went my disciple was there he was writing a book

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.892
and he said Mother do you know that Nepal has the maximum number of erotics?

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.892
I said no, I never saw. We were moving about with our daughters

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.892
we had never seen any erotics anywhere.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.892
Oh it’s full with that. I said where on top of every temple

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.892
I said why do you see the top of the temple, why don’t you see inside the temple,

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.892
he said no on top of the temple you’ll find lots of these erotics.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:03.892
I said where? You know to my amazement when we went there the Japanese had put up,

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:14.892
long, these wires and what you call them, what you call them those big machine like ladders,

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:21.892
special ladders they have and with the zoom lenses they were taking photographs of these erotics.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.892
I said Baba what’s the matter with these?

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.892
I said what is there to see in that, and they were taking photographs of these.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.892
I said from this distance I can’t see anything. I mean any Indian who goes there,

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:39.892
goes to a temple, his attention is on the Deity and he’s not bothered we never saw these things.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.892
What is there outside?

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.892
And these Japanese are there with the zoom there’s one falling down and holding onto the wire,

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:50.892
another standing on his head trying to arrange the camera, to get what?

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:58.892
That filth, dirt. I was amazed because our attention is used to filth,

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:06.892
you see if you know people who are, called a sweepers in India, they have to clean the,

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:12.892
which is not very good thing, but they do dirt cleaning thing, or the garbage cleaning;

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.892
and they have no nose to feel the dirt or anything. You see they become like animals,

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.892
they can pass through any dirt or filth.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:28.892
Same thing happened to us, we have no sense left of sin. What’s wrong? So what!

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.892
That’s what we have lost sensitivity to sense

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.892
but after realisation you just become sensitivity and you abhor it, you just leave it.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.892
So the discrimination takes place.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.892
You never enjoy a sinful act and the enjoyment of righteousness

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.892
and virtue starts flowering into and you become flowering personality.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.892
You really enjoy yourself, you never say I hate myself

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.892
or you never use this word I hate you and next movement I love you.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.892
That sort of a nonsense goes away from your tongue.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.892
You become beautiful person whose never bored, whose never bored.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:11.892
You enjoy your own company so much even if you are in jail you’re enjoying yourself,

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.892
whether outside, you enjoying yourself because you are there, you are not lost.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.892
So this is how our attention becomes enlightened and you become the joy.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:28.892
And this joy fills you up completely. You become personality of magnetism, complete magnetism.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:34.892
I was surprise that best perfume that they produce in Paris is called as joy,

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:41.892
is the most expensive is joy, I think they have found out that joy has that magnetism in it,

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.892
and it is from pure flowers, actually these flowers we find in India.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.892
I don’t know where you find them here or not, from where the joy is made,

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:54.892
but whatever it is, what I find that the people are hitting the point all right,

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:04.892
in every way this is joy, the perfume. Joy means the joy is the perfume in a human being.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.892
If you have that within you, you may not take bath for ten days

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.892
you will never have a problem of any smelling or anything,

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.892
because you are perfume, you become a perfume.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.892
Anywhere, even some people think of me they get the perfume.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.892
All kinds of perfumes you might say, it happens like that,

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.892
because in the attention the Mother earth which was the element,

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:35.892
the matter becomes the perfume, the causal; causal of the mother earth is perfume,

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.892
it becomes the perfume.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.892
The magnetism of the Mother Earth becomes the magnetism in your personality.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.892
Whatever you have, got it from five elements, goes back into its primitive stage,

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.892
in the sense that it becomes its causal. Like it becomes the glow,

00:50:52.000 --> 00:51:01.892
the phagous is the, the causal of light, the causal of light is phagous, is the glow,

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:07.892
your face glows, your skin glows, there’s a glow on your face.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.892
Sometimes you find glow around the thing, but to see glow is not good,

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:19.892
that I’ll tell you sometimes later, but you do see a person like this has glow on his face.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.892
So you become your primitive, or you can say your causal, of which you are made,

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.892
all your five elements express in it’s causal.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.892
But now the causal is aware, that’s the only difference there is.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:41.892
So you become the joy, source of joy, and the giver of joy and you yourself enjoy yourself,

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.892
because your ‘self’ is so glorious, so great and so joy

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.892
May God Bless You..

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:48.000
End
