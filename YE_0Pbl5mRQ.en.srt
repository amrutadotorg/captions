H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
Press-Conference

2
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:36,920
London, England, July 8, 1999

3
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:49,079
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

4
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:55,891
First of all, it’s important to know what
the truth is.

5
00:03:56,911 --> 00:04:03,760
You find so many people are seeking the truth,
but they don’t know what to find and that’s

6
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:11,080
how they are twisted around, taken to some
sort of a false rites.

7
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:17,150
It’s important first of all to know what
is the truth that we are seeking.

8
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:30,410
The truth is, if I tell you, it’s very simple:
that you are not this body, you are not this

9
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:41,690
mind, you are not this intellect, you are
not these emotions, but you are the pure Spirit.

10
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:47,370
That’s what you have to become – the pure
Spirit.

11
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:59,209
And another truth is that the power that leads
you to the state were you know the truth about

12
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:07,000
yourself, about everything is within you,
this power is within you, is your own.

13
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,510
Born with you, with every human being.

14
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:18,049
That’s surprising: if all the human beings
in the whole world have this power within

15
00:05:18,049 --> 00:05:21,679
their triangular bone - how can we differentiate
them?

16
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:27,390
They are all just the same, everybody has
a power based in their triangular bone known

17
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:35,220
as sacrum, that means the Greeks knew it was
a sacred bone.

18
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:43,239
This fact that there is a power in the triangular
bone was known thousands of years back, I

19
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:47,519
should say, in India and in various countries.

20
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,390
I was surprised – even in Sweden I found,
Norway I found, people were talking about.

21
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:57,560
I don’t know how they came to know about.

22
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:03,939
Specially Moscow I found people who knew about
it.

23
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:05,799
“How do you know?”

24
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:06,829
I asked them.

25
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:08,709
They said: “Our forefathers told us”,
like that.

26
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:17,679
Specially with Indian Americans they are very,
very down-to-earth people, very natural people,

27
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:20,060
I think – they also knew about it.

28
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,090
And Africans also knew about it.

29
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:29,429
But they didn’t know how to raise it.

30
00:06:29,429 --> 00:06:32,029
That was the only problem they had.

31
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:38,799
And though they knew about the centres, about
which just now you have been told, they didn’t

32
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:45,360
know how to enlighten them through this power
– can you imagine?

33
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,209
This knowledge became – sort of - a knowledge
which people would not accept, because we

34
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:54,550
live with science or rationality.

35
00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:01,479
This is something beyond that, but Einstein
has said so, Einstein has said very clearly

36
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:06,150
- that there is a torsion area beyond the
mind.

37
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:16,680
And you have to go to that torsion area where
you can get cognitive science – called science,

38
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,990
but I would say, cognitive personality.

39
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,480
So, how is it going to happen to go beyond
the mind?

40
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,960
If you try anything it is through your mind
only.

41
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,120
Whatever you do is through your mind.

42
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,850
So to go beyond your mind is not possible.

43
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:42,630
Now this power lies in the triangular bone,
which we can see also clearly sometimes in

44
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:46,080
some people who have obstruction, where it
cannot rise.

45
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,560
You see the pulsation in the triangular bone
which is just a bone.

46
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:58,100
But when it rises it is a so smooth movement
of this power.

47
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:03,900
Now there are some people who have written
that this is a very dangerous thing and this

48
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:10,310
happens and that happens, maybe because they
can’t explain, maybe because they don’t

49
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:17,020
know anything about it perhaps, maybe they
do not want to know human beings to have it.

50
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:27,120
Now, this power is kept within us because
now our last breakthrough of our evolution

51
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,160
has to take place.

52
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:36,860
We have to rise to that state which you can
call self-realized or there is 1001 names

53
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,860
for it.

54
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:45,849
So many people had this power within them
- they felt it also but they were not so much

55
00:08:45,849 --> 00:08:47,560
capable I think, of raising the Kundalini.

56
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,620
Sufis, you have heard about.

57
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:59,050
Saints, many saints – William Blake, I would
say, from England, there were so many people.

58
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,780
Shakespeare is another one.

59
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,250
They all were realized souls.

60
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:09,509
The way they have expressed themselves shows
very well how detached they were and how beautifully

61
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:13,069
they understood the reality.

62
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:19,810
So when this Kundalini rises as they have
been told, She passes through these six centres.

63
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:27,699
And these six centres are responsible for
our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual

64
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:28,699
being.

65
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:39,460
So, when these centres go into jeopardy, some
because of exhaustion, maybe something, then

66
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:43,259
it is needed to be nourished and this Kundalini
nourishes them.

67
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:47,550
Not only It nourishes but It also integrates
them.

68
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:53,439
So you get your personality in a state where
you are completely integrated.

69
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:57,020
But then She pierces through your fontanel
bone area.

70
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,590
This is the actualisation of baptism, you
can say.

71
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:07,919
Actually She pierces through and gets you
connected to the all pervading power of Divine

72
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:08,919
Love.

73
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,930
It’s all love, nothing else but love.

74
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,710
Truth is love and love is truth.

75
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:21,090
And when She becomes one with that you are
a transformed personality.

76
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,800
Firstly your centres are enlightened.

77
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:31,780
So your health improves, mentally you get
balanced and also emotionally you understand.

78
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:40,650
But the greatest thing that happens to you
is that you become a new personality with

79
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,009
collective consciousness.

80
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:45,599
Jung has talked about it – “collective
consciousness”.

81
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:48,539
That you can feel another person.

82
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:51,229
You can feel your own centres on your fingertips.

83
00:10:51,229 --> 00:10:57,780
First you feel the cool breeze in your hand.

84
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:05,749
That is the cool breeze described in the bible
as “the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost”.

85
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:08,730
And also in Sanskrit language they call it
“Saleelam, Saleelam”.

86
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,410
In Koran it is described as “Ruh”.

87
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,639
Everywhere it is described with different
names, meaning the same.

88
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:19,010
You start feeling this cool breeze in your
hands, specially on your fingertips and these

89
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:23,540
fingertips denote your different chakras as
shown there.

90
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:31,150
So, if there is something wrong with your
centres, then it is indicated on your fingertips;

91
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:37,020
but if it is something wrong with others also
it is indicated because you become, - again

92
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:43,600
I say, it’s a question of becoming - you
become collectively conscious.

93
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:52,670
But with that you are not disturbed, you are
absolutely at peace with yourself and absolutely

94
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,670
satisfied.

95
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:58,999
How it happens that our mind is always thinking
about the future, about the past.

96
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:07,580
And our mind is dancing over the cusp of these
thoughts, which are like this.

97
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:14,850
But when this Kundalini rises She elongates
them and there is a space in between created

98
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,609
and that space is, what we can say, is the
present.

99
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:25,869
We can be in the future, we can be in the
past, but we cannot be in the present, and

100
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:28,700
when you are in the present you are absolutely
thoughtless.

101
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,510
You just become a witness.

102
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:40,570
A witness state comes into you and you start
watching everything, not reacting.

103
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,430
And absorbing everything, very easy.

104
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,790
It’s a very wonderful thing that happens
to you.

105
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:56,070
So this mechanism is placed within you to
give you that special personality, to give

106
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:01,320
you that new awareness of collective consciousness,
and the last breakthrough of your evolution.

107
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:11,499
Till human awareness you are alright, till
that I must say they still are there somehow.

108
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:17,970
But we are afraid of the future of human beings,
because such a turmoil, so many problems,

109
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:25,100
so many kinds of ideas people have, which
is surprising that in these modern times what

110
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:32,910
people are thinking: they are something absolutely
primitive, I should say, criminal.

111
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:38,049
Violence and things, all this has to disappear.

112
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:44,770
And I was happy to hear that you all want
transformation, the resurrection.

113
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:52,080
You want transformation, and transformation
on a collective scale.

114
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,540
This is quite possible, absolutely possible.

115
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:03,249
Once you are transformed, you become a person
of tremendous love and patience.

116
00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:06,010
You love everything.

117
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,169
You understand everything through love.

118
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:18,840
It’s not love of – some sort of a – expectations,
it’s a love of giving.

119
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:27,210
You just enjoy giving, giving everything is
so enjoyable that time, that state and you

120
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,210
become so peaceful.

121
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:34,060
Then, as you know, the economics is like that,
people will work very hard to have, say, a

122
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:41,590
carpet like this and then this is all done,
then they will have some motorcar, then they

123
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:48,160
want to have a house, I mean, goes on from
one to another, they are never satisfied.

124
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,369
The thing for which you have worked so hard
is finished.

125
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:56,720
Then again starts a new urge to have something
new.

126
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,130
Goes on like that, the whole economics work
like that.

127
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:05,601
But here, once I see this carpet, for example
here, I just go into thoughtless awareness.

128
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:07,450
And what do I see?

129
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:17,260
I see the joy, I feel the joy of the person,
of the artist, who makes and enjoy this.

130
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:26,020
Otherwise thinking, I would think how much
it must have cost, where can I buy this, or

131
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:33,049
if it is mine I would be worried, Oh God,
how I’ve not insured this, which has no

132
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:34,049
meaning.

133
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:38,370
But I cannot enjoy unless and until I become
thoughtlessly aware.

134
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:43,930
Also in our Patanjali Yoga it is written down
as Nirvichara Samadhi.

135
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:50,929
But he has made four stages of the whole thing
is that first is this “Sarvichar”.

136
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:55,580
Sarvichar means “with thoughts” and then
without thoughts, but in Sahaja Yoga it is

137
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,630
not so.

138
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:06,570
It is so quick that you become thoughtlessly
aware first, and then you become doubtlessly

139
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:07,570
aware.

140
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,100
That is there are no doubts about yourself.

141
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:15,530
You know there is a power flowing and you
know by experiment that this power, this power

142
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,640
can cure people, can help others.

143
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,950
And the attention, which is very high.

144
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:27,489
Like I found people say “I like this, I
want this” - that disappears.

145
00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:30,169
Attention goes to others.

146
00:16:30,169 --> 00:16:38,910
You want to see what others would like, others
would feel, and the whole personality gets

147
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:45,039
completely enshrined with the feeling of oneness
with others.

148
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:48,550
It’s something has to happen to all of you.

149
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:57,910
I’m happy I lived in England at least for
20 or 22 years and couldn’t meet you people.

150
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,390
But now, thank God, you people have thought
of it.

151
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,979
Now we live with science and rationality.

152
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:05,729
This is something beyond that, as I told you.

153
00:17:05,729 --> 00:17:11,950
It is beyond science and rationality which
is accepted as cognitive science, people say.

154
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:17,700
And also as I’ve told you Einstein has talked
about the torsion area.

155
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:22,499
But how to achieve it, I don’t think he
has written anything about it.

156
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:30,270
So this is your own power within yourself
for which I don’t have to do anything – they

157
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,039
might have said it, alright.

158
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:33,109
I accept it.

159
00:17:33,109 --> 00:17:36,530
But once it rises in you, it’s like one
candle can enlighten many candles.

160
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:42,669
And that’s how you can spread Sahaja Yoga
very far.

161
00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:50,320
We have, say, they say so, we are now in 72
countries, possibly.

162
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,260
Because one person gets it, he goes to his
country, starts working.

163
00:17:54,260 --> 00:18:00,429
And India, of course, Indians know this very
well, they know they have to achieve only

164
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:01,440
this.

165
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:09,090
Like some people told me that we are like
Indian culture.

166
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:17,060
So, we have taken to Indian style of life
and we are very satisfied.

167
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,660
I said “Is that the end?”

168
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:23,470
We have so many Indians who are following
that culture.

169
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,059
Are they satisfied people?

170
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:27,140
Is that the end?

171
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:32,700
What have you to do according to Indian scriptures
also - that you have to know yourself.

172
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,220
You don’t know yourself.

173
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:39,380
You don’t know what’s wrong with you,
unless and until you can feel your centres

174
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,950
on your fingertips.

175
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:46,479
You will not know what’s wrong with you
– till you end up with something horrible.

176
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:51,820
But as soon as you get your Realisation, immediately
you can feel it on your fingertips - your

177
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,820
problems.

178
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:58,820
Now, supposing you know how to cure it, you
can cure anybody’s and you don’t have

179
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,880
to pay for it.

180
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:05,290
See, again and again I’ve said that “it
is your own, it’s your power.

181
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:08,740
You can’t pay for it.”

182
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:14,890
I don’t know how people believe that for
spirituality you can pay, it cannot be sold.

183
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:17,880
In America it was very difficult.

184
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,220
They all came to me and told me: “You have
to sell it”.

185
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,240
I said: “How?”

186
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,640
They said: “Do something, otherwise nobody
will come to you.”

187
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,239
I said: “But I cannot do something that
is not done.”

188
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:34,600
So they said: “Alright, you do one thing:
take money from them and tell them that when

189
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,789
you come for follow-up you will get back your
money.”

190
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:46,580
So much we are bound by money that if you
have paid the money you think you are bound.

191
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,100
You have to do it.

192
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,850
And absurd things like that human beings think.

193
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:55,559
But why don’t they think that we have to
change this world?

194
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:59,780
They have to have emancipation of human being.

195
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,780
Why now?

196
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:06,720
Instead of doing all kinds of other things,
the best thing is to change yourself, transform

197
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,519
yourself and enjoy.

198
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:11,080
And enjoyment is complete.

199
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,060
Because enjoyment is singular.

200
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:19,240
It is not happiness, unhappiness, it’s just
enjoyment.

201
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,360
You enjoy everything.

202
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,150
Even the smallest thing can give you enjoyment.

203
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:33,000
And then you don’t start feeling depressed
or doing that kind of a tantrums that you

204
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,450
do to trouble others, but you are so much
enjoying and everybody enjoys you also, because

205
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,170
you are so enjoyable.

206
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:46,450
That’s the thing that should happen to human
beings and when it happens it’s something

207
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:52,400
really very, very great and that should happen
to all of you.

208
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,210
And I’ll be very happy, I was told you are
all very great dignitaries here and you can

209
00:20:55,210 --> 00:21:08,480
do a lot and this is how we have a chance
of first of all getting your Self Realisation.

210
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,120
Knowing your Self.

211
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,639
And then helping people.

212
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:17,779
With a genuine love and affection.

213
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:23,763
I don’t know how much I should talk because
we’ve had so many lectures after lectures

214
00:21:23,763 --> 00:21:25,230
and there’s no end to it.

215
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:29,350
But lecturing doesn’t help – it is something
else to work out within yourself.

216
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,500
That is the most important thing.

217
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:36,700
Now, I would like also to have some questions
from you.

218
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:43,580
If you have gone thoughtless I can’t help
it.

219
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:52,389
Question: Have you overcome all the fears
of life?

220
00:21:52,389 --> 00:21:59,240
You are not afraid of death also?

221
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:31,248
Shri Mataji: I don’t know that part, but
definitely I knew that I have to find out

222
00:25:31,248 --> 00:25:39,058
a way and method by which I could give en-masse
realisation.

223
00:25:39,058 --> 00:25:43,397
Because people used to give realisation, no
doubt, but one person used to give to one

224
00:25:43,397 --> 00:25:44,397
person.

225
00:25:44,397 --> 00:25:47,164
One of the reasons maybe because anybody who
was saintly, people used to torture them,

226
00:25:47,164 --> 00:25:48,164
trouble them.

227
00:25:48,164 --> 00:25:49,164
They wouldn’t like a person like that because
that person was something – out of the blue,

228
00:25:49,164 --> 00:25:50,164
you can call it.

229
00:25:50,164 --> 00:25:54,808
So that was an attitude towards a person who
was a realised soul.

230
00:25:54,808 --> 00:26:04,877
Everybody suffered, whether they were Sufis
or they were – otherwise even William Blake,

231
00:26:04,877 --> 00:26:12,688
I mean, everyone whosoever said something
different, people didn’t like.

232
00:26:12,688 --> 00:26:19,418
So maybe that’s the reason they used to
give it to one person.

233
00:26:19,418 --> 00:26:20,548
That was the tradition.

234
00:26:20,548 --> 00:26:26,858
Realisation was such that out of thousands
they used to select one person, work on him,

235
00:26:26,858 --> 00:26:30,678
cleanse him, do this, do that and then give
realisation.

236
00:26:30,678 --> 00:26:31,897
One person.

237
00:26:31,897 --> 00:26:38,527
But I felt that the time has come that you
must give en-masse realisation.

238
00:26:38,527 --> 00:26:44,688
Unless and until people get en-masse realisation,
we cannot change this world.

239
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:48,378
And I worked, I should say, for days together.

240
00:26:48,378 --> 00:26:53,918
Luckily my father was a very social personality,
even my husband was.

241
00:26:53,918 --> 00:26:56,848
So I had a good chance to meet people.

242
00:26:56,848 --> 00:27:03,978
In my own subtle ways I used to find out what
is the permutation and combination of problems

243
00:27:03,978 --> 00:27:08,048
inside the human beings and then how to work
it out.

244
00:27:08,048 --> 00:27:13,478
That’s the only thing I did more, I think,
otherwise so many people used to give Self

245
00:27:13,478 --> 00:27:15,517
Realisation at different times.

246
00:27:15,517 --> 00:27:21,178
But what I found out a method by which thousands
of people can get realisation.

247
00:27:21,178 --> 00:27:23,648
Question: How did you come upon this method?

248
00:27:23,648 --> 00:27:26,108
Shri Mataji: Just, you see, I discovered it.

249
00:27:26,108 --> 00:27:36,878
You see, it’s a thing I worked it out.

250
00:27:36,878 --> 00:27:48,238
Have all gone thoughtless, or what?

251
00:27:48,238 --> 00:27:52,027
Yes, madam?

252
00:27:52,027 --> 00:28:05,767
Question: When you depart from this body,
as this lady was asking, where does the spirit,

253
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,038
where do the energy stay?

254
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:14,168
Shri Mataji: Spirit – it’s a very long
answer, but I would say, Spirit goes according

255
00:28:14,168 --> 00:28:16,868
to its desire, alright.

256
00:28:16,868 --> 00:28:26,158
Now, supposing there is a drunkard, who dies,
now he wants to drink still, even if he’s

257
00:28:26,158 --> 00:28:27,158
dead.

258
00:28:27,158 --> 00:28:34,298
He will hang in somewhere in the limbo, I
think, he will get hold of somebody who drinks

259
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:36,938
a lot.

260
00:28:36,938 --> 00:28:43,247
This side of psychology, people don’t understand
in the west.

261
00:28:43,247 --> 00:28:46,377
Because it’s nothing in the medicine about
this.

262
00:28:46,377 --> 00:28:53,527
The other day I read a very nice article about
it, was published in America.

263
00:28:53,527 --> 00:28:58,008
That Japanese believe that you get possessed
by a spirit.

264
00:28:58,008 --> 00:29:03,318
Even in the bible it is so that you get possessed
by the spirit.

265
00:29:03,318 --> 00:29:09,738
But they have said that 50 to 60% people get
possessed.

266
00:29:09,738 --> 00:29:14,158
Schizophrenia, all kinds of psychological
problems come from that.

267
00:29:14,158 --> 00:29:18,308
Now, in India also we believe in it.

268
00:29:18,308 --> 00:29:25,818
And if you can remove the possession of a
person the person completely changes, no doubt.

269
00:29:25,818 --> 00:29:30,698
But this is still in the realm of science,
you cannot get it.

270
00:29:30,698 --> 00:29:36,647
I mean, I would say that, psychology is still
a childish science and in that realm they

271
00:29:36,647 --> 00:29:40,108
don’t understand what is this possession.

272
00:29:40,108 --> 00:29:47,517
Is a fact that so far they have not gone into
it, but we know in Sahaja Yoga very clearly,

273
00:29:47,517 --> 00:29:56,418
because we get catches on the left hand side,
say here on this thumb, that means a person

274
00:29:56,418 --> 00:29:57,418
is possessed.

275
00:29:57,418 --> 00:30:01,808
Yes, it’s like that, it’s so simple.

276
00:30:01,808 --> 00:30:04,908
And then you can cure that person.

277
00:30:04,908 --> 00:30:06,767
So many persons have been cured.

278
00:30:06,767 --> 00:30:07,928
So many.

279
00:30:07,928 --> 00:30:16,777
Who have given up as lunatics, or schizophrenic
or all kinds have been cured, no doubt.

280
00:30:16,777 --> 00:30:22,678
But it is to be seen and to be worked out,
then you can believe it.

281
00:30:22,678 --> 00:30:26,438
Because people don’t believe that there
is such a thing.

282
00:30:26,438 --> 00:30:28,118
But there is.

283
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:32,997
There is some sort of a negative force which
overpowers human beings, it is true.

284
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,988
I must tell you the truth.

285
00:30:35,988 --> 00:30:49,168
We have had so many cases, even in England,
where people were possessed.

286
00:30:49,168 --> 00:30:50,218
So many cases.

287
00:30:50,218 --> 00:30:58,678
On the contrary I would say that cancer and
all psychosomatic troubles come to people

288
00:30:58,678 --> 00:31:01,248
when they shift to the left side.

289
00:31:01,248 --> 00:31:03,228
Means to the past.

290
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:09,818
Maybe some viruses which are dead long time
back are in our being – that everything

291
00:31:09,818 --> 00:31:11,678
is past is in our being.

292
00:31:11,678 --> 00:31:13,108
So they can attack.

293
00:31:13,108 --> 00:31:18,238
And I’ve told them long time back somehow
through this cognitive knowledge that they

294
00:31:18,238 --> 00:31:23,710
will call by 53 proteins and 63 progenides
[ ? UNCLEAR] I told them.

295
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:28,088
And now they know it is so.

296
00:31:28,088 --> 00:31:32,838
So cancer is curable in Sahaja Yoga, we have
cured cancers, of many people.

297
00:31:32,838 --> 00:31:34,368
Absolutely curable.

298
00:31:34,368 --> 00:31:41,308
We have an hospital in India, already established
near Bombay.

299
00:31:41,308 --> 00:31:44,757
There’s a nice hospital where people are
cured.

300
00:31:44,757 --> 00:31:49,757
And we don’t charge them for any treatment,
only for the stay.

301
00:31:49,757 --> 00:31:59,408
It’s a fact, you see, because people never
talk about it, they never told you.

302
00:31:59,408 --> 00:32:04,108
So you think it’s a, some sort of a mythological
thing, it’s not.

303
00:32:04,108 --> 00:32:11,208
It is there, it exists.

304
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:15,617
So many diseases are not cured because we
don’t know about them.

305
00:32:15,617 --> 00:32:23,658
You see, I was myself in a medical school,
so I know that they know very limited things.

306
00:32:23,658 --> 00:32:26,788
Beyond that, they don’t know.

307
00:32:26,788 --> 00:32:27,788
But in Japan, I was surprised that they believe
in it and they treat people.

308
00:32:27,788 --> 00:32:33,798
Even in India, I mean, they know.

309
00:32:33,798 --> 00:32:45,507
Question: What do you give, provide the definition
of enlightenment?

310
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:59,257
Shri Mataji: Enlightened means a personality,
enlightened personality, I can tell you, is

311
00:32:59,257 --> 00:33:05,757
a person who is beyond his mind.

312
00:33:05,757 --> 00:33:13,007
And he is in contact completely with this
all-pervading power of divine love.

313
00:33:13,007 --> 00:33:21,578
As a result everything in that person is guided,
helped by that divine love.

314
00:33:21,578 --> 00:33:32,608
That power is so great that it looks after
you, it organizes everything, it thinks, it

315
00:33:32,608 --> 00:33:37,238
understands, it is wisdom of all the things.

316
00:33:37,238 --> 00:33:43,738
You become a person who is so collectively
conscious.

317
00:33:43,738 --> 00:33:47,517
Today we need people like that.

318
00:33:47,517 --> 00:33:49,858
Otherwise you always think about yourself.

319
00:33:49,858 --> 00:33:58,098
About others you can only think when you are
collectively conscious.

320
00:33:58,098 --> 00:34:03,517
But these days there are so many people marketing
their spirituality, you see.

321
00:34:03,517 --> 00:34:05,387
That’s also there.

322
00:34:05,387 --> 00:34:08,088
And just people jump to it, I don’t know
why.

323
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:17,867
Why don’t they find out what is the gain,
what did you gain out of it?

324
00:34:17,867 --> 00:34:24,497
Nobody wants to know.

325
00:34:24,497 --> 00:34:45,978
Question: How did you find America?

326
00:34:45,978 --> 00:34:48,848
Shri Mataji: They are antipodes.

327
00:34:48,848 --> 00:34:54,237
I don’t know what to say, they are very
money-oriented, extremely money-oriented.

328
00:34:54,237 --> 00:35:00,418
And they can’t understand me because I’m
not asking for money, you see, they can’t

329
00:35:00,418 --> 00:35:01,418
understand.

330
00:35:01,418 --> 00:35:02,418
It’s very difficult.

331
00:35:02,418 --> 00:35:06,588
And how to penetrate that veil of theirs?

332
00:35:06,588 --> 00:35:16,257
So, this time it has been much better, I should
say, I’ve been there.

333
00:35:16,257 --> 00:35:21,848
I went first, long time back, 1973 I went
there, and I saw the people how mad they were.

334
00:35:21,848 --> 00:35:26,258
After one boy was a 16 years old guru, you
see.

335
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:28,737
They just giving money to him.

336
00:35:28,737 --> 00:35:32,468
So, I asked him “Why they are giving money?”

337
00:35:32,468 --> 00:35:34,007
What is the need to give money like this?

338
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:35,007
To this guru?

339
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:37,358
They said: “Because he is giving us spirit.”

340
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:40,647
Where is he giving you spirit?

341
00:35:40,647 --> 00:35:47,478
And then this fellow, he was wiser than others
I should say, because he settled down as a

342
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:54,117
young one, he married some American lady and
used his money, but all the rest of them,

343
00:35:54,117 --> 00:36:02,938
so many of them, went there to befool them.

344
00:36:02,938 --> 00:36:04,908
It’s endless.

345
00:36:04,908 --> 00:36:07,848
Still going on.

346
00:36:07,848 --> 00:36:21,838
But unless and until you accept the truth,
you cannot change.

347
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:24,498
Accept us in the sense you have to ask for
it.

348
00:36:24,498 --> 00:36:26,498
You should have pure desire.

349
00:36:26,498 --> 00:36:33,538
This Kundalini is the power of pure desire
within you.

350
00:36:33,538 --> 00:36:36,608
When She rises She gives you your pure desire.

351
00:36:36,608 --> 00:36:40,608
Not like this, changing from one to another.

352
00:36:40,608 --> 00:36:44,448
And if you have pure desire only then it works
out.

353
00:36:44,448 --> 00:36:58,387
If you don’t have, it won’t work out - no.

354
00:36:58,387 --> 00:37:01,158
I cannot force it.

355
00:37:01,158 --> 00:37:11,258
Cannot be forced, you see.

356
00:37:11,258 --> 00:37:16,828
Question: How are children, young children?

357
00:37:16,828 --> 00:37:18,017
Shri Mataji: Oh, some of them are great.

358
00:37:18,017 --> 00:37:23,158
These days so many realised souls have been
born, these state [or these days?

359
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:24,588
UNCLEAR] . We don’t understand them.

360
00:37:24,588 --> 00:37:30,068
But there are so many, even in England there
are born so many of them.

361
00:37:30,068 --> 00:37:39,548
Born realized – they are special ones.

362
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:46,408
I mean, this fact, it happens, so many good
things happen to the society, like drug addiction,

363
00:37:46,408 --> 00:37:52,918
over night people in this England gave up
drugs, over night.

364
00:37:52,918 --> 00:38:02,147
I’ve got one land far away from madding
crowd, I should say, in upstate New York,

365
00:38:02,147 --> 00:38:09,887
and I wanted to start a curative centre for
drug addicts, because that is one of the big

366
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:11,678
problems here.

367
00:38:11,678 --> 00:38:14,117
But they said the public won’t allow.

368
00:38:14,117 --> 00:38:15,267
I said: “Why?”

369
00:38:15,267 --> 00:38:17,198
They said: “They go amok.”

370
00:38:17,198 --> 00:38:24,418
This place is so far fetched, you cannot give
a walk all the way – and if, I mean, they

371
00:38:24,418 --> 00:38:27,298
allow me I could help a lot.

372
00:38:27,298 --> 00:38:30,828
But somehow, even in Italy, is difficult.

373
00:38:30,828 --> 00:38:38,098
And the biggest problem today, even in America,
is drug addiction.

374
00:38:38,098 --> 00:38:41,698
Another you can call AIDS.

375
00:38:41,698 --> 00:38:48,068
We tried AIDS also, but AIDS-people are something
wrong with them, they are extremely arrogant.

376
00:38:48,068 --> 00:38:52,968
Quarrelsome, arrogant, they think they are
martyrs - something like that.

377
00:38:52,968 --> 00:38:57,738
We’ve tried, we’ve helped one or two – no
doubt.

378
00:38:57,738 --> 00:38:58,738
But it’s very difficult.

379
00:38:58,738 --> 00:39:01,208
But these drug addicts can’t be helped very
easily.

380
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:06,978
But there is no proper way, if you all can
arrange something - I would like to.

381
00:39:06,978 --> 00:39:13,487
In your, this London city only, I should say,
at least 10 or 11 people like that.

382
00:39:13,487 --> 00:39:15,138
First time I talked they’ve got cured.

383
00:39:15,138 --> 00:39:23,358
They were all doing very well, were very well
educated.

384
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:28,798
All these problems can be solved.

385
00:39:28,798 --> 00:39:33,357
But the government should help, in a way.

386
00:39:33,357 --> 00:39:39,538
Because you know they, so much time even to
take permission for something.

387
00:39:39,538 --> 00:39:45,867
Sometimes like 10 years, 20 years, you go
on applying.

388
00:39:45,867 --> 00:39:49,757
I am already very old and I don’t know what
will happen, if I go on like this.

389
00:39:49,757 --> 00:39:52,147
For 20 years for a permission.

390
00:39:52,147 --> 00:39:53,308
Very difficult.

391
00:39:53,308 --> 00:40:01,468
But you people can organize something like
that.

392
00:40:01,468 --> 00:40:08,928
And I can work it out.

393
00:40:08,928 --> 00:40:15,148
You can see the results.

394
00:40:15,148 --> 00:40:19,588
You can see the results, you can save these
children.

395
00:40:19,588 --> 00:40:20,588
Alcoholism, alcoholism also can be corrected.

396
00:40:20,588 --> 00:40:21,588
Yes, please?

397
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:22,588
Question: Shri Mataji, would you say a few
words about the golden age?

398
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:25,378
The forthcoming golden age?

399
00:40:25,378 --> 00:40:39,039
Shri Mataji: You see, Aquarius, as they say,
Aquarius according to our astrology is the

400
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:40,039
Kundalini.

401
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:48,308
The Kundalini is Aquarius according to Indian,
I should say, Indian science of (HINDI word

402
00:40:48,308 --> 00:40:50,928
– Sir C.P. explains:)

403
00:40:50,928 --> 00:40:51,928
Astrology.

404
00:40:51,928 --> 00:41:00,708
And, you see, they, what they say that this
age of Aquarius is very important, because

405
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:04,528
this will change the lives of people.

406
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:13,358
And that is what they have already described
about this, that now there was Kali Yuga,

407
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:15,658
means the worst possible times.

408
00:41:15,658 --> 00:41:24,428
The whole Kali Yuga means the absolutely the
worst and worst possible time for our destruction.

409
00:41:24,428 --> 00:41:26,708
That was over.

410
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:32,008
Then comes Kruta Yuga, I mean, overlapping.

411
00:41:32,008 --> 00:41:39,788
Now, in Kruta Yuga, this all-pervading power,
they call it Paramchaitanya, becomes active.

412
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:44,038
It starts helping people to come along.

413
00:41:44,038 --> 00:41:48,148
That also has been going on some days.

414
00:41:48,148 --> 00:41:50,488
After this, is Satya Yuga.

415
00:41:50,488 --> 00:41:54,148
It’s the age of truth.

416
00:41:54,148 --> 00:41:57,718
But it’s a last judgement.

417
00:41:57,718 --> 00:42:00,388
If you take to truth, alright, well and good.

418
00:42:00,388 --> 00:42:02,268
But if you don’t take to truth you are judged.

419
00:42:02,268 --> 00:42:03,268
It’s like this.

420
00:42:03,268 --> 00:42:04,418
Now how many people take to truth, very surprising.

421
00:42:04,418 --> 00:42:09,348
Like a place like Russia, you’ll be amazed
- Russia.

422
00:42:09,348 --> 00:42:10,998
Country like Russia.

423
00:42:10,998 --> 00:42:18,838
I went there and I first time went to Saint
Petersburg, that’s Leningrad that time.

424
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:30,928
And when I went to the hall I saw about 2000
people sitting outside.

425
00:42:30,928 --> 00:42:40,398
Because there you have to pay for a hall,
I mean, the hall people.

426
00:42:40,398 --> 00:42:42,168
So, 2000 seats were all occupied inside.

427
00:42:42,168 --> 00:42:46,928
So these people outside, people said: “Maa,
are you not going to give us realisation?”

428
00:42:46,928 --> 00:42:53,018
I said: “How do they know all this?”

429
00:42:53,018 --> 00:42:54,018
Somebody must have told them.

430
00:42:54,018 --> 00:43:00,118
When I went in I said: “Alright, wait, I’ll
come back then I’ll give you Realisation.”

431
00:43:00,118 --> 00:43:02,448
So, I went inside.

432
00:43:02,448 --> 00:43:09,428
Inside there were 2000 people nicely sitting
down, listening to me and then they got their

433
00:43:09,428 --> 00:43:10,428
realisation.

434
00:43:10,428 --> 00:43:11,428
All of them.

435
00:43:11,428 --> 00:43:12,428
I was amazed.

436
00:43:12,428 --> 00:43:13,428
What’s the matter?

437
00:43:13,428 --> 00:43:15,778
How is it they’re working so fast?

438
00:43:15,778 --> 00:43:23,198
And then I came out and I saw there were again
these 2000 still sitting there.

439
00:43:23,198 --> 00:43:25,438
45 minutes they were still.

440
00:43:25,438 --> 00:43:30,358
I said: “Alright, you all come tomorrow
morning, we’ll sit outside.”

441
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:35,258
Now, in Moscow they have huge big places,
huge big compounds and buildings.

442
00:43:35,258 --> 00:43:41,778
I said: “I’ll sit on the steps and I’ll
try to give you realisation.”

443
00:43:41,778 --> 00:43:47,368
You won’t believe – 2000 from inside,
2000 from outside and one thousand extra,

444
00:43:47,368 --> 00:43:54,038
I mean, 5000 people gathered there next morning
and they all got their realisation.

445
00:43:54,038 --> 00:44:00,158
In Moscow, you won’t believe how many people,
if somebody asks me, I cannot say, have got

446
00:44:00,158 --> 00:44:01,158
realisation.

447
00:44:01,158 --> 00:44:04,908
Now, the reason, I reasoned it out what must
be the reason.

448
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:08,498
I asked them: “How is it?

449
00:44:08,498 --> 00:44:11,488
Had you advertised that much?”

450
00:44:11,488 --> 00:44:15,668
“No”, they said, “we saw your photograph.

451
00:44:15,668 --> 00:44:16,868
We knew.

452
00:44:16,868 --> 00:44:18,058
We came.”

453
00:44:18,058 --> 00:44:20,458
So sensitive, I say.

454
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:25,518
And thousands and thousands have got realisation.

455
00:44:25,518 --> 00:44:31,668
These people are so deep, so deep, so humble.

456
00:44:31,668 --> 00:44:42,508
I couldn’t understand why, why are they
so much spiritually endowed, how did they

457
00:44:42,508 --> 00:44:45,778
get all this.

458
00:44:45,778 --> 00:44:52,148
And what I found is that communism has given
them no freedom of any kind.

459
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:59,848
And as a result, I think, they got completely
oppressed and the whole thing growth was inside.

460
00:44:59,848 --> 00:45:09,168
And also if you have read those great novelist,
even Tolstoi, or anyone - they always show

461
00:45:09,168 --> 00:45:19,168
introspection, even by the hero or by the
villain, anybody, they all introspect.

462
00:45:19,168 --> 00:45:25,238
And this is the one, I thought, is the very
deep personalities they develop.

463
00:45:25,238 --> 00:45:29,058
And immediately they got it.

464
00:45:29,058 --> 00:45:33,818
A far fetched place called Togliatti where
they make motorcars, thousands and thousands

465
00:45:33,818 --> 00:45:38,938
– we could not get to any hall, because
formerly, I mean, normally what was the thing

466
00:45:38,938 --> 00:45:50,730
we were taken, we would have to take a stadium
– 18 to 20.000 in Moscow or Leningrad or

467
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:52,398
a big city.

468
00:45:52,398 --> 00:45:54,878
But in Togliatti we didn’t know what to
do.

469
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:56,318
So we just had it in the open.

470
00:45:56,318 --> 00:45:57,318
Thousands and thousands.

471
00:45:57,318 --> 00:45:58,468
But not in England – no.

472
00:45:58,468 --> 00:45:59,548
Much worse is America.

473
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:00,618
I don’t know why.

474
00:46:00,618 --> 00:46:03,238
Even Indians in England are no good.

475
00:46:03,238 --> 00:46:10,378
I just don’t know what happens to them.

476
00:46:10,378 --> 00:46:24,108
They are neither English nor Indian, I think,
something is, but we have very few Indians

477
00:46:24,108 --> 00:46:27,858
even, I must tell you this, very frankly.

478
00:46:27,858 --> 00:46:35,528
But in India we have so many, so thousands
and thousands who have got realisation.

479
00:46:35,528 --> 00:46:42,888
Though Indians know they have to have self
realisation, even here.

480
00:46:42,888 --> 00:46:47,688
But somehow they are fed up, I don’t know
of what.

481
00:46:47,688 --> 00:46:53,348
Even if you read Shakespeare you feel like
understanding that he was a great realised

482
00:46:53,348 --> 00:46:54,348
soul.

483
00:46:54,348 --> 00:47:02,038
What he showed was the futility of human endeavour
in every line, it’s clearly shown.

484
00:47:02,038 --> 00:47:05,618
That’s what he was.

485
00:47:05,618 --> 00:47:14,018
I can’t understand, see, because I’ve
read so much Indian novels and English novels

486
00:47:14,018 --> 00:47:16,278
and English writers.

487
00:47:16,278 --> 00:47:17,898
I find all of them are so enlightened.

488
00:47:17,898 --> 00:47:22,248
Can’t understand what’s happening in England
now.

489
00:47:22,248 --> 00:47:23,248
Why?

490
00:47:23,248 --> 00:47:35,318
Now, 20 years I’ve been in England, first
time I’m meeting people like you.

491
00:47:35,318 --> 00:47:36,898
Why?

492
00:47:36,898 --> 00:47:44,838
I would ask you, people.

493
00:47:44,838 --> 00:47:51,198
Really, I can’t understand.

494
00:47:51,198 --> 00:47:55,038
Even Austria, you have thousands.

495
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:58,518
Italy, where Roman Catholics you know, are
so many.

496
00:47:58,518 --> 00:48:00,448
Italians, wonderful.

497
00:48:00,448 --> 00:48:01,448
Thousands.

498
00:48:01,448 --> 00:48:08,688
But I didn’t live so long there as I‘ve
lived in England.

499
00:48:08,688 --> 00:48:12,808
Moreover, you see, language-wise, I know this
language, though I never studied English,

500
00:48:12,808 --> 00:48:18,258
but I know English language, how to speak.

501
00:48:18,258 --> 00:48:28,878
But there in their language, it’s Italian
or, I don’t know how.

502
00:48:28,878 --> 00:48:37,928
I’m very happy today that you all have come
and I hope now from you it will start going

503
00:48:37,928 --> 00:48:39,608
into other people.

504
00:48:39,608 --> 00:48:47,518
Because it’s very important: we have to
change this world.

505
00:48:47,518 --> 00:48:51,738
And, I would say, they also said, some newspaper
people have come, but I said: “I’m sorry,

506
00:48:51,738 --> 00:48:55,118
I don’t know what they will think of me.”

507
00:48:55,118 --> 00:48:58,018
Because they have never been very supportive.

508
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:01,738
But I think they don’t realise their responsibility.

509
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:02,738
Really!

510
00:49:02,738 --> 00:49:10,798
Sometimes I see newspapers, I think they don’t
realise how much they are harming people by

511
00:49:10,798 --> 00:49:12,048
wrong directions.

512
00:49:12,048 --> 00:49:15,228
By sensational things.

513
00:49:15,228 --> 00:49:21,078
What they have to do is to see what will be
the effect of these things that we are writing.

514
00:49:21,078 --> 00:49:29,058
Is it going to help them to rise above all
these things like jealousies and violence

515
00:49:29,058 --> 00:49:36,508
and all these things that are really completely
corroding our humanity.

516
00:49:36,508 --> 00:49:45,928
So, I think, all those lines, I don’t find
them and by head, I would say, I’ve met

517
00:49:45,928 --> 00:49:47,668
some of them, they were just after me.

518
00:49:47,668 --> 00:49:49,438
“How is it you are in England?”

519
00:49:49,438 --> 00:49:54,008
I said: “Because my husband has a job here,
that’s how I’ve come.”

520
00:49:54,008 --> 00:49:56,248
Then all kinds of funny, funny questions they
were asking.

521
00:49:56,248 --> 00:50:02,968
You know, I was surprised, they are not interested
in spirituality at all.

522
00:50:02,968 --> 00:50:14,498
So, then, whenever they said “Mother, somebody
is coming from there” I said: “Now - please.”

523
00:50:14,498 --> 00:50:17,218
All kinds of things they would say.

524
00:50:17,218 --> 00:50:21,228
“Your country is so poor, what are you doing
here?”

525
00:50:21,228 --> 00:50:24,198
Then I had to tell them why we are poor.

526
00:50:24,198 --> 00:50:33,598
I said: “300 years if you have a guest in
your house without a visa what will happen

527
00:50:33,598 --> 00:50:35,218
to you?”

528
00:50:35,218 --> 00:50:46,498
Then another question: “Why you have got
so many, such a big population, so many children

529
00:50:46,498 --> 00:50:47,498
born?”

530
00:50:47,498 --> 00:50:55,058
I said: “In that also, I would say, that
what I have read about England is this, that

531
00:50:55,058 --> 00:50:58,198
so many children are killed every week, by
the parents even.”

532
00:50:58,198 --> 00:51:07,088
I said: “So, the children must be deciding
to be born in a poor country than in a country

533
00:51:07,088 --> 00:51:09,808
where they can be killed.”

534
00:51:09,808 --> 00:51:13,068
I mean, simple thing like that.

535
00:51:13,068 --> 00:51:17,968
Because children want love, they don’t understand
anything else.

536
00:51:17,968 --> 00:51:20,318
So like that they asked me funny, funny questions.

537
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:26,688
I said: “I am here for spirituality, talking
to about spirituality, and why should I worry

538
00:51:26,688 --> 00:51:33,178
about what I am, what is this and what is
that?”

539
00:51:33,178 --> 00:51:38,148
Say, we have to change our attitude.

540
00:51:38,148 --> 00:51:40,028
Very important.

541
00:51:40,028 --> 00:51:44,558
Of course I know some people who are very
broad, broad minded attitude towards people,

542
00:51:44,558 --> 00:51:45,608
very much.

543
00:51:45,608 --> 00:51:51,208
I’ve known some in India also, but there
are so few.

544
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:57,748
If this thing has to be done it has to be
mass-scale.

545
00:51:57,748 --> 00:52:04,238
Now, we have Sahaja Yogis, many Sahaja Yogis,
I should say, but still I’m not satisfied.

546
00:52:04,238 --> 00:52:10,328
I think we need many more.

547
00:52:10,328 --> 00:52:11,348
Hindustani…

548
00:52:11,348 --> 00:52:12,368
HINDI…

549
00:52:12,368 --> 00:52:26,328
I don’t know why.

550
00:52:26,328 --> 00:52:38,048
Such a big tradition you have in our country.

551
00:52:38,048 --> 00:52:45,418
Instead of bringing that here to this country,
I don’t know what’s happening.

552
00:52:45,418 --> 00:52:48,628
And they are also very, very spiritual people.

553
00:52:48,628 --> 00:52:55,388
There too, you read their books you see, you’ll
be amazed.

554
00:52:55,388 --> 00:52:56,618
Very spiritual.

555
00:52:56,618 --> 00:53:03,378
But suddenly the whole thing has turned round,
I think so that spirituality has lost its

556
00:53:03,378 --> 00:53:04,378
power.

557
00:53:04,378 --> 00:53:10,568
And maybe some, you imported some of the horrible
gurus from there also might be.

558
00:53:10,568 --> 00:53:18,798
That might be another reason, I think so.

559
00:53:18,798 --> 00:53:23,728
But now, I think, they are very much reduced
in number, there are few still going round,

560
00:53:23,728 --> 00:53:24,748
making money, doesn’t matter.

561
00:53:24,748 --> 00:53:31,048
But now you people are very sensible, very
highly placed, you should do something about

562
00:53:31,048 --> 00:53:34,688
it, my request is.

563
00:53:34,688 --> 00:53:43,788
I’m available and never used to say, whatever
you say.

564
00:53:43,788 --> 00:53:46,828
It’s a new mission where you have to do
something.

565
00:53:46,828 --> 00:54:16,668
You are the ones who are going to completely
revolutionize the whole world.

566
00:54:16,668 --> 00:54:20,668
You can do it.

567
00:54:20,668 --> 00:54:24,228
Absolutely everybody is capable of doing that.

568
00:54:24,228 --> 00:54:25,998
Question: Another question: What’s your
opinion of Avataras?

569
00:54:25,998 --> 00:54:28,438
Shri Mataji: Alright, what’s the use of
my opinion about it?

570
00:54:28,438 --> 00:54:29,548
There are Avataras, no doubt.

571
00:54:29,548 --> 00:54:30,548
Alright?

572
00:54:30,548 --> 00:54:31,758
But you don’t believe me when I say that.

573
00:54:31,758 --> 00:54:33,808
Unless and until you experience you shouldn’t
believe even me.

574
00:54:33,808 --> 00:54:36,908
Alright, this is something and because you
asked me I’m saying so.

575
00:54:36,908 --> 00:54:41,018
But I don’t say you believe in some Avataras,
first of all you experience them.

576
00:54:41,018 --> 00:54:48,168
Everything that is now – you will know gradually
into different things and on every centre

577
00:54:48,168 --> 00:54:49,168
there is somebody sitting there.

578
00:54:49,168 --> 00:54:50,168
Who are they and what work they do?

579
00:54:50,168 --> 00:55:00,968
All this is to be consumed and to be seen
and to be experimented.

580
00:55:00,968 --> 00:55:05,948
Now, I say, supposing this centre is catching
…. [UNCLEAR] it is the centre very important

581
00:55:05,948 --> 00:55:12,328
because it is in the optic chiasma like this,
you see, it’s constricted.

582
00:55:12,328 --> 00:55:15,928
Now, how to open this?

583
00:55:15,928 --> 00:55:17,368
Very difficult.

584
00:55:17,368 --> 00:55:20,518
Now, I say, you forgive everybody.

585
00:55:20,518 --> 00:55:25,508
You forgive everybody – it opens.

586
00:55:25,508 --> 00:55:26,878
Why?

587
00:55:26,878 --> 00:55:31,298
Because Christ, Christ is on that centre.

588
00:55:31,298 --> 00:55:33,498
And his message is to forgive.

589
00:55:33,498 --> 00:55:42,478
Is, I mean, you should know who is on which
centre and what works out.

590
00:55:42,478 --> 00:55:45,848
That’s only to be known.

591
00:55:45,848 --> 00:55:51,438
Once you get your Self Realisation, only you
have to know this much, who is the one responsible

592
00:55:51,438 --> 00:55:53,418
for which chakras.

593
00:55:53,418 --> 00:55:54,728
That’s all.

594
00:55:54,728 --> 00:56:02,548
And you, you have to do according to – like
it’s a mantra now, to say that “I forgive

595
00:56:02,548 --> 00:56:03,548
everyone”.

596
00:56:03,548 --> 00:56:07,598
Now, some people would say it’s very difficult
to forgive.

597
00:56:07,598 --> 00:56:11,188
But logically: if you forgive or don’t forgive
– what are you doing?

598
00:56:11,188 --> 00:56:12,388
You don’t do anything.

599
00:56:12,388 --> 00:56:16,668
But if you don’t forgive then you torture
yourself.

600
00:56:16,668 --> 00:56:20,658
That’s why you forgive everyone.

601
00:56:20,658 --> 00:56:23,048
And this opens.

602
00:56:23,048 --> 00:56:27,838
Most constricted – it opens like this.

603
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:34,228
Question: So, which God is for the Kundalini?

604
00:56:34,228 --> 00:56:35,348
Christ is over here.

605
00:56:35,348 --> 00:56:37,118
Which God is in the Kundalini?

606
00:56:37,118 --> 00:56:38,118
In the triangle?

607
00:56:38,118 --> 00:56:43,618
Sahaja Yogi: What is the God or the deity
in the triangular bone, the Kundalini?

608
00:56:43,618 --> 00:56:46,568
Shri Mataji: Kundalini itself.

609
00:56:46,568 --> 00:56:51,008
The Kundalini is your own mother.

610
00:56:51,008 --> 00:56:53,238
Your individual mother.

611
00:56:53,238 --> 00:56:59,378
And She has tape-recorded all your past and
your aspirations, everything.

612
00:56:59,378 --> 00:57:08,468
And She rises because She wants to give you
your second birth, but She is your individual

613
00:57:08,468 --> 00:57:09,468
mother.

614
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:11,749
You don’t share Her with anybody else.

615
00:57:11,749 --> 00:57:16,558
Yours is a different, somebody else’s is
different.

616
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:19,628
Because the tape-recording is different.

617
00:57:19,628 --> 00:57:21,628
And She knows everything about you.

618
00:57:21,628 --> 00:57:27,488
So, when She rises She does, goes very slowly,
without harming you, without troubling you

619
00:57:27,488 --> 00:57:33,998
and pierces through.

620
00:57:33,998 --> 00:57:50,228
We say She is the reflection of the Adi Shakti
who is called as Holy Ghost in the bible.

621
00:57:50,228 --> 00:57:57,118
But She rises without any difficulty.

622
00:57:57,118 --> 00:57:58,628
Hardly any time it takes.

623
00:57:58,628 --> 00:58:01,998
Would they like to have their Self Realisation?

624
00:58:01,998 --> 00:58:06,738
Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji asks if you would
like to experience this and have your Self

625
00:58:06,738 --> 00:58:07,738
Realisation?

626
00:58:07,738 --> 00:58:09,758
Very quick, very easy.

627
00:58:09,758 --> 00:58:12,778
Shri Mataji: Hardly any time.

628
00:58:12,778 --> 00:58:15,058
Now, you forget the past.

629
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:20,238
Another thing you have to do is to forgive
yourself.

630
00:58:20,238 --> 00:58:21,238
And not to feel guilty about anything.

631
00:58:21,238 --> 00:58:33,228
Very important, because if you feel guilty
then this centre catches here on the left.

632
00:58:33,228 --> 00:58:40,378
When it catches here on the left you can get
spondylitis, you can also get angina.

633
00:58:40,378 --> 00:58:42,758
So why, why to feel guilty?

634
00:58:42,758 --> 00:58:46,158
Whatever has happened has happened, forget
everything.

635
00:58:46,158 --> 00:58:48,818
Not to feel guilty – very important.

636
00:58:48,818 --> 00:58:53,968
I know here people feel more guilty, not in
India.

637
00:58:53,968 --> 00:58:59,348
They never feel guilty.

638
00:58:59,348 --> 00:59:01,828
But in the west they do.

639
00:59:01,828 --> 00:59:06,058
But there’s no need, no need to condemn
yourself, you have to have great honour and

640
00:59:06,058 --> 00:59:19,138
love for yourself, because you are special
people and that you are going to help the

641
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:22,048
whole world.

642
00:59:22,048 --> 00:59:26,428
So respect yourself!

643
00:59:26,428 --> 00:59:36,638
As I respect you and love you.

644
00:59:36,638 --> 00:59:45,388
You, please, respect and love yourself.

645
00:59:45,388 --> 00:59:46,848
Alright.

646
00:59:46,848 --> 00:59:56,018
Now, what you have to do is to put both the
hands towards me, like this, just like this,

647
00:59:56,018 --> 01:00:01,208
because I told you these are the endings of
the sympathetic nervous system.

648
01:00:01,208 --> 01:00:08,798
It’s like this – little open, like this.

649
01:00:08,798 --> 01:00:17,088
You don’t have to doubt yourself, by any
chance.

650
01:00:17,088 --> 01:00:19,888
Please, don’t doubt.

651
01:00:19,888 --> 01:00:32,388
Now, you put your left hand like this towards
me and right hand on top of your head here.

652
01:00:32,388 --> 01:00:39,018
On top, means away, not touching the head.

653
01:00:39,018 --> 01:00:46,488
You can bend your head and see for yourself.

654
01:00:46,488 --> 01:00:55,388
Now see, if there is a cool or a hot breeze
coming out of your fontanel bone area which

655
01:00:55,388 --> 01:00:58,848
was a soft bone in your childhood.

656
01:00:58,848 --> 01:01:07,098
Just see for yourself, if there’s a hot
or a cool breeze-like vibrations coming out

657
01:01:07,098 --> 01:01:13,848
of your fontanel bone area which was the soft
bone in your childhood.

658
01:01:13,848 --> 01:01:18,608
Now, you can move your hand and see for yourself.

659
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:25,458
You can move it, sometimes you can feel it
higher, sometimes lower or on the sides.

660
01:01:25,458 --> 01:01:26,458
See for yourself.

661
01:01:26,458 --> 01:01:30,518
If it is hot that means, of course, you have
got your Realisation, but if it is hot that

662
01:01:30,518 --> 01:01:32,868
means you have not forgiven yourself.

663
01:01:32,868 --> 01:01:37,358
Or you have not forgiven others.

664
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:48,138
So, please forgive others, also forgive yourself
fully.

665
01:01:48,138 --> 01:01:50,828
Please forgive.

666
01:01:50,828 --> 01:02:05,658
Now, please put your right hand towards me,
bend your head.

667
01:02:05,658 --> 01:02:18,288
And see for yourself if you have cool or hot
breeze-like vibrations coming out of your

668
01:02:18,288 --> 01:02:28,778
fontanel bone area which was the soft bone
in your childhood.

669
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:33,838
Please try.

670
01:02:33,838 --> 01:02:54,078
Please bend your head and see for yourself.

671
01:02:54,078 --> 01:03:03,408
Now, please take down your hands, both hands
and put them towards me, like this.

672
01:03:03,408 --> 01:03:06,808
And don’t think.

673
01:03:06,808 --> 01:03:11,758
Just don’t think.

674
01:03:11,758 --> 01:03:25,698
Because I already told you, you have a right,
it’s your birthright to have this Yoga,

675
01:03:25,698 --> 01:03:27,678
union with the divine, it’s your birthright.

676
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:47,788
Now, you have to put both your hands towards
the sky like this and push back your head

677
01:03:47,788 --> 01:03:59,588
and ask me – I’ll tell you about three,
three things, three questions you can say.

678
01:03:59,588 --> 01:04:03,968
You have to say one question three times,
only one of them.

679
01:04:03,968 --> 01:04:13,558
For example you can ask, you can call me Mother,
Mother – or Shri Mataji, whatever you like.

680
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:18,418
Mother is, is this the cool breeze of the
Holy Ghost?

681
01:04:18,418 --> 01:04:24,308
Ask in your heart this question “Mother
is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

682
01:04:24,308 --> 01:04:25,308
Ask three times.

683
01:04:25,308 --> 01:04:32,038
Or, you can ask “Mother, is this the all-pervading
power of divine love?”

684
01:04:32,038 --> 01:04:39,198
Or you can ask third question “Mother, is
this the Paramachaitanya or Ruh?”

685
01:04:39,198 --> 01:04:46,228
Ask anyone of these questions, anyone of them,
three times.

686
01:04:46,228 --> 01:04:50,318
Now - let’s have it.

687
01:04:50,318 --> 01:04:59,508
Alright, please put down your hands again
and put them towards me.

688
01:04:59,508 --> 01:05:04,068
Please, don’t doubt, please don’t doubt.

689
01:05:04,068 --> 01:05:07,418
That’s something very important.

690
01:05:07,418 --> 01:05:18,808
If you start feeling a cool or a hot breeze
on your fingertips or on your palm, same or

691
01:05:18,808 --> 01:05:28,928
out of your fontanel bone area, out of your
head, anyone of them, then raise your both

692
01:05:28,928 --> 01:05:33,668
the hands, raise your both the hands – those
who have felt it that way.

693
01:05:33,668 --> 01:05:51,238
Those who have felt the cool breeze in their
hands.

694
01:05:51,238 --> 01:06:16,678
Thank you very much!

695
01:06:16,678 --> 01:06:37,188
Most of you have got it.

696
01:06:37,188 --> 01:06:38,188
Unbelievable…

697
01:06:38,188 --> 01:06:41,058
You got it?

698
01:06:41,058 --> 01:06:43,968
No – not yet?

699
01:06:43,968 --> 01:06:44,968
Alright.

700
01:06:44,968 --> 01:06:48,018
Who didn’t get it now?

701
01:06:48,018 --> 01:06:49,018
She also.

702
01:06:49,018 --> 01:06:50,018
You didn’t get it, madam?

703
01:06:50,018 --> 01:06:51,018
You got it?

704
01:06:51,018 --> 01:06:53,488
They can help you, let us see.

705
01:06:53,488 --> 01:06:55,658
You got it?

706
01:06:55,658 --> 01:06:59,278
You felt the cool breeze?

707
01:06:59,278 --> 01:07:04,418
Now – you felt it.

708
01:07:04,418 --> 01:07:12,818
Keep it like that.

709
01:07:12,818 --> 01:07:29,248
Let it flow as much as possible, is very good.

710
01:07:29,248 --> 01:07:36,208
You all can do this, it’s very simple.

711
01:07:36,208 --> 01:07:38,378
She has it now?

712
01:07:38,378 --> 01:07:41,398
Sahaja Yogi: It’s warm, Mother, it’s warm.

713
01:07:41,398 --> 01:07:43,128
Shri Mataji: It’s warm?

714
01:07:43,128 --> 01:07:51,968
Alright, put her left to the right.

715
01:07:51,968 --> 01:08:02,358
Raise her left.

716
01:08:02,358 --> 01:08:16,208
What’s she catching on?

717
01:08:16,208 --> 01:08:40,438
Sahaja Yogi: It’s left Vishuddhi, Shri Mataji.

718
01:08:40,438 --> 01:08:50,828
Shri Mataji: Left….

719
01:08:50,828 --> 01:09:01,218
Are you Bengali?

720
01:09:01,218 --> 01:09:21,988
Seeker: I am from the Caribbean.

721
01:09:21,988 --> 01:09:46,228
Shri Mataji: Now you just don’t think.

722
01:09:46,228 --> 01:09:54,798
That’s what you should practice a little
bit.

723
01:09:54,798 --> 01:10:00,748
Put your hands towards me, all of you and
don’t think.

724
01:10:00,748 --> 01:10:02,578
What is it?

725
01:10:02,578 --> 01:10:05,358
Did you feel the Kundalini?

726
01:10:05,358 --> 01:10:09,338
Are you feeling it on the head?

727
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:15,728
Warm, so that’s it – put her left to the
right.

728
01:10:15,728 --> 01:10:19,118
Raise her left and put down the right.

729
01:10:19,118 --> 01:10:22,368
It has nothing to do with the air-condition.

730
01:10:22,368 --> 01:10:25,138
You feel it on your fingers – alright?

731
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:26,138
Now better?

732
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:27,138
Now alright?

733
01:10:27,138 --> 01:10:28,198
May God bless you!

734
01:10:28,198 --> 01:10:30,488
Just keep go on like that.

735
01:10:30,488 --> 01:10:31,488
Alright?

736
01:10:31,488 --> 01:10:32,488
Are you feeling?

737
01:10:32,488 --> 01:10:33,488
Cool or hot?

738
01:10:33,488 --> 01:10:34,488
Cool now?

739
01:10:34,488 --> 01:10:35,488
Now she’s got it.

740
01:10:35,488 --> 01:10:36,488
So, thank you very much!

741
01:10:36,488 --> 01:10:37,488
Thank you, all of you!

742
01:10:37,488 --> 01:10:38,488
May God bless you! (quietly)

743
01:10:38,488 --> 01:10:40,878
You have to practice now.

744
01:10:40,878 --> 01:11:52,758
Can you not tell them to come to some follow-up
or some program like that?
