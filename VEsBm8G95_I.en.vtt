00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.640
So, Thomas, I'm really happy to welcome you this evening here to tell us a few of your

2
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:20.160
stories from your time in Sahaja Yoga. When did you join? What year did you get your realization?

3
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:32.000
79, I met, it was not the first time I came across Sahaja Yoga, but just let me briefly

4
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.280
say about this video which we saw just now. It's worth really to spread because I think

5
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.040
it's not so much known how she might have just shown this exercise. And I just want

6
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.520
to use it sometimes briefly just lowering the head like this, breathing in, putting

7
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.360
the attention on sasara and then breathing out when this light comes into sasara. And

8
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:11.340
it's really a nice way to be easily thoughtless. Anyway, yeah, it was 78 actually that I met

9
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:23.020
one Mr. Rustam Borjorje who is known for being one of the prominent yogis in that time. He

10
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:33.060
was an Indian from a well-off family who studied psychritory and he was a doctor, a psychiatrist

11
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:44.180
in London. And somehow he was, had a contact to a German psychologist in my study place

12
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:51.060
which is Freiburg and Breisgau near Basel, near Switzerland and French border. So he

13
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.360
got the chance from this lady to use her practice for learning to get some money also from,

14
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:05.840
I don't know what was the reason, but actually he took some patients from her. And as I studied

15
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:18.160
social work, it was quite normal that people would do some kind of psychological treatment

16
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.640
or whatever it is. And one of my friends in study, my best friends in that time, he went

17
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:33.440
to this lady and met Mr. Rustam Borjorje. When he came back next day in our university,

18
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.480
he told me about this incident that Rustam told about, Sahaja Yoga. And he tried to give

19
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.960
realization also to him, which he did not feel as such, but he told me about it. And

20
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.960
especially he said that this TM business, which I practiced for some years also like

21
00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000
many other in England, many other yogis, that this TM is very bad. And I was just on the

22
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.760
cusp to leave it because I felt like in a glass house and I didn't go in the deeper,

23
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:19.760
fortunately in the deeper areas of this so-called transcendental meditation. And so somehow

24
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.680
this struck me that he said this is a very negative thing. And so I made an appointment

25
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.680
with Rustam Borjorje. And when I came, I felt when he opened the door, I felt a tremendous

26
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.960
power in his personality. I would not say I felt vibrations, but it was some authority

27
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:47.960
I felt from him also because he was a person like this to emit this authority. And so he

28
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:58.000
tried to work on me and I did not feel cool and I did not have extreme strong experience.

29
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000
It was more hot, I remember. He gave me some lemons in the end and said, you should, you

30
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
worked with the lemons on me. He said, you should dump it in the next river, which I

31
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:19.040
did. And also he told me you can meditate also in the church in Freiburg, which has

32
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.040
a beautiful Madonna, which gives vibrations. I did so. And also he gave me the little black

33
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:31.040
and white, this big picture of Shri Mataji. Well, and then time passed and then in the

34
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:39.040
next year, Gregoire and Gregoire had visited Rustam. Gregoire was in Switzerland, it was

35
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:47.040
not so far. So he visited Rustam in this, in my place. And I met Gregoire also. And

36
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:55.040
so everything came into place. And then next year Rustam phoned me and said, you can come

37
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:04.040
to England to meet Shri Mataji. Well, I did so. I booked a flight. At that time already

38
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:12.040
there was very cheap flights. I was a cool student. And when I came, I slept in the airport,

39
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:18.040
in the lawn outside of the airport because the plane came rather late. Next year, I went

40
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:25.040
to Dollis Hills, which was in north, northeast, northwest London. A typical attached raw house

41
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:32.040
with, which was one of the first ashrams in London at that time. So when I arrived, there

42
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:43.040
was hardly anybody there, but somebody told me Shri Mataji is not here. I don't know how

43
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.040
I could not check that before, but it was just a fact Shri Mataji was not here. And

44
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:58.040
they said she is apparently in the north of England. Well, everybody knew where and

45
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:05.040
what. And as I always wanted to go to Scotland, I hitchhiked to Scotland with my army sleeping

46
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:14.040
back. And then I ended up in this so-called loch, loch is the lake in Scotland, they call

47
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:22.040
loch. And it's a place, a small little lake in the highlands north of Edinburgh with a

48
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.040
youth hostel. So I spent two days in this youth hostel and I felt very pleasant, I must

49
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:39.040
say. I remember I was trying to paint something of the landscape, walking around. And next

50
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:47.040
day, I drove with a little highland train back to Edinburgh. And the next stop was Loch

51
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:56.040
Renoch. And Loch Renoch, which I found out two years later, Loch Renoch was exactly the

52
00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:03.040
place where Shri Mataji held a seminar in the hotel, which was the hotel where Peter

53
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:10.040
Pierce and Linda Pierce, who were somehow heads of the M movement in Scotland, they

54
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:18.040
have held seminars there. And Shri Mataji somehow wanted to work out this place. And

55
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:25.040
so it struck me really that in this huge highland, I was coming with a train on that station,

56
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:32.040
stopping at the station without knowing I was about one kilometer from Shri Mataji.

57
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:37.040
It is just one of these miracles. And so I didn't meet her.

58
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.040
Sorry, Thomas, that was while Shrimachi was there, exactly at the same time?

59
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:47.040
Yes, of course. Yeah. When she did the seminar with some yogis, that was what people in

60
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:52.040
London meant when they said she's in North England.

61
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.040
Wow.

62
00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:02.040
So that was just amazing, if I look back. So I came back without my so-called mission

63
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:13.040
accomplished, went back to Germany. That was summer, yeah? It was summer because I was

64
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:21.040
sometimes sleeping outside. I was not really a hippie, but of course, I was in that time.

65
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:30.040
I was about 25 or so. Anyway, so in the winter, in December, I flew again and Ustom had told

66
00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:42.040
me there would be a Buddha, which I didn't know what it was. But I went again, came back,

67
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:48.040
came to Dulles Hills and the preparation was going on for this famous guru,

68
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:54.040
Pudya Vaisvimadaji, declared, I am the one who came to save the humanity. I am the Adi Shakti,

69
00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:01.040
the power of God. You know the whole speech, which is so amazing, where it actually the

70
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:09.040
first time declared herself. And well, I was present in that without my, I was not a

71
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:18.040
without having my realization from her. Having the whole pudya, I mean, everything I went

72
00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:26.040
through, I bowed, I got the book also in the end from Gregoire, the advent arrived in these

73
00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:33.040
days. The Adi Shakti gave a signature. And at the end of the whole thing, we were, I was

74
00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:38.040
sitting with three others in a row and before Shri Mataji and I was introduced like a

75
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:48.040
musical and what, and she was working on some man next to me and I was closing my eyes and

76
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:55.040
so I was sitting, sitting, of course, waiting. And so in one moment, Shri Mataji said,

77
00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:02.040
so open your eyes and how are you? And I said, I am not a man. I am a woman.

78
00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:08.040
And she said, close your eyes. And suddenly there was this movement inside me to my heart.

79
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:15.040
All the, I mean, pain, what you want to say of life or the tragedy. I mean, I was not

80
00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:23.040
especially, I didn't have a tragic life, but as many seekers, we went through some issues.

81
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:29.040
I don't know. It was just coming out. Maybe it was just the joy of the spirit to feel that

82
00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:35.040
complete relief, but it was like pouring out of me. And then one moment she said, now it's

83
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:42.040
coming up now. Laugh it out. And in that moment, it was like a rocket. It was a huge

84
00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:50.040
universe opening. It was just so amazing, beautiful. And I had to laugh really. And I

85
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:55.040
mean, this thoughtlessness and this stage lingered on not in the same way, but it

86
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:03.040
lingered on for, for the next days. And even in the ashram in the night, I woke up and

87
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:10.040
was completely bathed in bliss. And then Shri Mataji was going after the whole ceremony

88
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:19.040
and English people were singing in the same way. And I was just, I was just, I was

89
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:25.040
singing Christmas carols, which was so beautiful. And later in my life, I always was

90
00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:32.040
singing with my children, these, these English carols. And she said, oh, there's a bit

91
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:40.040
left, they are a bit left sided because Jesus was in the cradle. So they are a bit like

92
00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:47.040
that, but she liked them quite a lot, especially, especially away in the manger. She

93
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:52.040
liked quite a lot. And when she walked out of the room, wisdom was beside me and said,

94
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:58.040
said, bow down to her. You will not have the chance so often. So I saw what people did.

95
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:05.040
I didn't know that one can do it actually. So I was bowing down on the earth and Shri

96
00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:13.040
Mataji passed by and said, stopped and said, get up. And how are you now? And I said, oh,

97
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:19.040
I'm fine, but it's not like before. And then she asked me, did you have a guru? I said,

98
00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:25.040
yeah, this is this TM stuff I did for, but not so long. But then she said, yeah, it's

99
00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:31.040
very bad. And you should say, mother, you're my guru. So I put my hands and I said,

100
00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:40.040
are you my guru? And then, woof, again, it was raising tremendously. And I, I was

101
00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:49.040
like, this was a start, which was just so amazing. I think Shri Mataji could do it.

102
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:58.040
She could, I mean, decide to give it. I don't know. But as it is, I coming home in my,

103
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:07.040
to my studies and with the friends and trying to talk about it, it was as usual talking

104
00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:14.040
about the taste of a mango to, to, to somebody who never had a mango before. It's,

105
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:24.040
it's just impossible to describe also the frustration, I must say. And so this was my

106
00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:33.040
start. And later on in that place, Shri Mataji came, Shri Mataji came to that place

107
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:39.040
later, but it was not easy to, to have two, three yogis to work with them. Mostly

108
00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:48.040
they were funny people also. And, but I tried. And so, so

109
00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:53.040
Should I share this photograph of Shumashi when Shumashi came to,

110
00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:59.040
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I can show that.

111
00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:10.040
Is four photographs, which I've, yeah, this is, this is it. So I don't know exactly

112
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:15.040
the ones from the program, which program that was. I think it may have been in

113
00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:23.040
Zurich, but the one below, right below is in Bonn. Bonn was my hometown where I went

114
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:32.040
to school and Gregor had sent me, I think 81, was it 80 or 81, had sent me a letter

115
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:40.040
that Shumashi is doing a tour from Geneva, Lausanne, Zurich, Bern, Basel in Switzerland.

116
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:49.040
And why don't you organize something in Freiburg and whatever. So I organized the

117
00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:56.040
first programs in Germany in Freiburg, exactly in the university where I was, the

118
00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:04.040
Audimax. And the second was in Bonn. So compared to German-Swiss, it was not so

119
00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:14.040
bad received in Freiburg. And so Catherine came with Shumashi, Gregor's wife,

120
00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:22.040
two others. One lady is seen in the pictures. She was Laurent's auntie, I think,

121
00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:31.040
and Laurent also who was there since some month who came. And after this first

122
00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:38.040
program in Freiburg, we drove together with the train to Bonn. So as it was, we

123
00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:43.040
arrived in Bonn and we worked by feet towards the inner town, which is a very

124
00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:51.040
close walk. And this was like a full diving into my past because first we passed

125
00:15:52.040 --> 00:16:01.040
the shop, the toy shop, big toy shop of one of my classmates' father. She went

126
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:09.040
in there and then we went on and she must have asked that he can eat or what.

127
00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:16.040
Or I said we can go to Kauf. Kauf is one of these big department stores where

128
00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:21.040
actually my father was the head of the restaurants all over the place. It was a

129
00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:27.040
department store in all of the big cities of Germany. So I was used to go to this

130
00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:32.040
place where my father worked and it was a special moment, of course, that we went

131
00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.040
to this restaurant. And as you can see in this photo, Shumashi had an ice cream

132
00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:48.040
after the main course. And it was also somehow the moment where this personal

133
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:54.040
report was so relaxed. For example, I remember we walked on the street towards

134
00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:59.040
this place, towards this department store, and she said something and I replied,

135
00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:09.040
aha. And she said, ah, in India we say acha, like confirming something. And like

136
00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:17.040
these little, little things. So in this department store she also bought a toy

137
00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:28.040
and she was trained for her grandson, I think. And the program was organized by

138
00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:34.040
an old friend of mine because I was not there. And actually the hotel also. The

139
00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:39.040
hotel was a disaster because it was so simple because I didn't know anything

140
00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:46.040
about the prestige and the worldly situation of Shumaji as a diplomat's wife

141
00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.040
and all this I didn't know and also I didn't have the money as a student to

142
00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:58.040
invest or I didn't know what to do. Actually I feel very shameful. And in that

143
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:05.040
place, I think after the program, we wanted to eat something and there was a

144
00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:12.040
vina vale downstairs. A vina vale was a chain for chicken, like Kentucky fried

145
00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:18.040
chicken, but in that time it was vina vale. And we brought the chicken up in her

146
00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:24.040
room in the paper, in this aluminum foil paper. We opened it when we all ate

147
00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:34.040
chicken, three of us or so. It was just one of these stories which many of you

148
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:41.040
may know going to McDonald's or whatever it is. And on top of that there was no

149
00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:48.040
soap in the bathroom. And she mentioned that and one year later I went in the

150
00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:53.040
room, in her room in Lausanne in Switzerland and I had bought a soap for her

151
00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:58.040
and I went in the room and out the door and she said, yeah, come in. And I said,

152
00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:06.040
Shumaji, I'm sorry for this hotel and I bought soap for you. And so she took

153
00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:11.040
out from her purse this green Chandrika soap, which you might know, Indian soap,

154
00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:17.040
Ayurvedic soap, and she let me smell that. And I remember it was opening the

155
00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:25.040
vishuddhi. It was such a feeling. And I can say, and she said good smells open

156
00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:31.040
the vishuddhi. So I just know after that it was very difficult for me to smell

157
00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:38.040
artificial smells. I cannot. I mean, all these lush and artificial smells or

158
00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:45.040
incense which are so bad, I cannot bear it. But on the other side, good smells

159
00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:54.040
really open the vishuddhi. So that was the story of the first meeting in Germany.

160
00:19:55.040 --> 00:20:00.040
And you saw also on these pictures, on the upper picture, you saw the farewell

161
00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:07.040
photo on the airport in Dusseldorf. And I with my leather jacket and Shumaji's

162
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:14.040
big smile. And I remember I was in heaven. I mean, it was just amazing to

163
00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:23.040
to pay farewell to her. Like in many, many situations in the world, it's very

164
00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:28.040
special. It was a very special moment. And she gave so much love in that moment.

165
00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:37.040
Yeah, that was the first picture. Yeah, so to say. That was my humble

166
00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:46.040
beginnings. And these experiences, the first experiences kept me going on.

167
00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:54.040
And I mean, many of us know that we go to hills and valleys. Sometimes there's

168
00:20:54.040 --> 00:21:04.040
valleys in life. But then you remember those deep moments and you keep on

169
00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:09.040
going because you know it was real. It was so real, more real than anything

170
00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:15.040
else. And then you keep going. And I kept going for the last now 40, I don't

171
00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:22.040
know, 44 years or so. And it's still that I feel that there's something to

172
00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:28.040
grow. And I feel it's beautiful, especially when I'm here in Capella now.

173
00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:37.040
There's nothing better than deep meditation. That's why whoever listens to

174
00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:43.040
me here, to my humble words, I can only say keep going, keep going and seek

175
00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:52.040
always the deepest moment. Don't give up and somehow keep up the search, the

176
00:21:53.040 --> 00:22:00.040
intensity of our search. This is so important. And then we develop slowly,

177
00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:05.040
slowly, sometimes without feeling even. Yeah.

178
00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:11.040
But certainly one of the things that helps us to keep going in our sahaja

179
00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:19.040
journey are the miracles. No? And you have, I think, so I'd like to ask you

180
00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:25.040
what miracles mean to you. Should I start by showing the picture then of

181
00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:30.040
Hanumanar, of Shri Mataji's Hanumanar? Yeah, please. Yeah, this is something

182
00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:43.040
amazing here. Actually I can say that I was not very fond of miracle photos,

183
00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:49.040
which I took a lot of photos in the past, so I knew what photos can, how

184
00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:55.040
photos can trick you. So many vibrations like flickering lights can be easily

185
00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:02.040
done by long exposures as we know. But Shri Mataji still used them and it's

186
00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:11.040
not up to me to judge that. But as I was always doubting Thomas in the sense

187
00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:22.040
that I stick only to that what I really feel and know and see and feel. And so

188
00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:27.040
in Shvetsingen near Frankfurt in an old castle you had this Hanumanar puja,

189
00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:33.040
which was so beautiful. It was just an amazing talk which you might know,

190
00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:38.040
you must know because it's talking about the whole Ramayana and it's just

191
00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:45.040
very beautiful. And before the puja we went to the market and Ian and me went

192
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.040
to the market, Ian, Paradigm and me, and we wanted to buy some flowers and

193
00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:58.040
fruit and whatever for the puja. So I said why don't we take herbs with us

194
00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:08.040
because there's this story that Hanuman was flying to rescue the brother

195
00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:15.040
of Rama who was near to die and there was only one this Sanjeevani grass which

196
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.040
was growing in some mountains and Hanuman brought the whole mountain because

197
00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:27.040
he could not make out this grass. So then we bought a lot of herbs,

198
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:33.040
the big bush and in the end of the puja I brought this bush in front of her,

199
00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:38.040
Ian and me went to her and she was very enthusiastic, took the whole bush,

200
00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:49.040
took each one of those, smelled it and on the mic commanded how, for what

201
00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:56.040
it is and how good it is and also how it is used in Ayurveda. It was a

202
00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:03.040
beautiful moment for me myself. Then before that there was this picture

203
00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:07.040
which you just showed and I was sitting on the side of the stage and I had

204
00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:12.040
my little camera and took this picture and actually I did not see what I did

205
00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:17.040
in that moment and what my camera did or what Shri Mataji did, let's say.

206
00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:22.040
When it came out, when I exposed the picture because at that time there was

207
00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:30.040
only analog films, I was just what? It was amazing because you can see

208
00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:39.040
Hanuman face in her so clearly, so clearly that it's just stunning and when

209
00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:45.040
I came to Kavella next time, somehow there was a meeting and I showed it

210
00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:50.040
to Shri Mataji and the others and was going around, they were all so amazed

211
00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:58.040
by this photo. Actually I lost the negative and I made a photo from a photo

212
00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:05.040
which is in the castle somehow. So, yeah, this was my personal miracle

213
00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:12.040
and it was a teaching that doubting may be okay but then you get your own

214
00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:19.040
miracle just like this doubting Thomas knew he had to put the finger in

215
00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:27.040
Christ's wound when he appeared after appearing for the, after his death

216
00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:33.040
appearing before the disciples, he was asked to put the fingers to prove

217
00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:39.040
that it's really real Christ. So, like this, I mean, this had maybe I was

218
00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:45.040
doubting Thomas. Sorry, what year was that puja again, Thomas?

219
00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:55.040
About? The 90s, early 90s. Right. But there are not many Hanuman pujas,

220
00:26:55.040 --> 00:27:00.040
it's called Hanuman puja in Germany, Schwezingen. Schwezingen is this place

221
00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:12.040
near Frankfurt and you can easily find it out. And then there's, I have,

222
00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:18.040
next on my list is the picture of Rahuri. Yeah, I sent you some pictures

223
00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:24.040
which, where I can easily think of the situation.

224
00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:30.040
Yeah, let me just share with them. That was the first India tour,

225
00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:37.040
I went, first India tour where I went, it was 84, 85. Yeah, this is it.

226
00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:43.040
This has a special history and a special significance for me also.

227
00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:52.040
I mean, there's so much to say, I mean, this Rahuri was a farm of Dumal.

228
00:27:53.040 --> 00:28:00.040
Dumal had given realizations to 10,000. He was a fantastic man and

229
00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:07.040
unfortunately he died very early somehow. And he was a sugar cane farmer

230
00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.040
and we went to this farm. And as you can see, it's a very rural area,

231
00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:15.040
a little bit you can see it on the house. And she might as well be wearing

232
00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:22.040
this simple cotton saree. And we were sitting in rows before her

233
00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:27.040
with our banana leaves on the ground and eating. So I was sitting a little

234
00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:34.040
bit behind and I saw her sitting there and I was just amazed by her beauty

235
00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:39.040
and the whole setting. And I went with my little camera, very shy,

236
00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:44.040
and with a gesture I asked if I can make a photo. And I made this photo

237
00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:51.040
and she gave me that smile, which is so much personal because she gave it

238
00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:57.040
to me in a way. But it also for me, it expresses, I don't know how you feel

239
00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:05.040
about it, it expresses a big amount of compassion. It's not only a smile,

240
00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:12.040
it's saying don't worry, don't worry, be happy. Don't have a lefty,

241
00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:21.040
shouldy, everything will be okay. And yeah, later on you see, it's funny,

242
00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:26.040
can you see on top of Shrimadaji's head there are three lines. Actually

243
00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:34.040
they are the covers of the house, a tree and the frame of the door.

244
00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:42.040
And sometimes I was wondering, see you have the dark which is the left side

245
00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:51.040
and the middle, the golden color and the red color is supposed to be the

246
00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:58.040
right side. And I was wondering does Shrimadaji at all have a right side

247
00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:07.040
or is everything on the left side, on the Idanadi, what is left side?

248
00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:11.040
Idanadi, yeah, the right is Pingala.

249
00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:17.040
Yeah, so is everything on the left side, everything is in her desire as

250
00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:21.040
she's Shakti, she desires and then it's carried out automatically.

251
00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:25.040
Can it be that she doesn't have any right side?

252
00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:33.040
Maybe somebody who sees that can respond to that. It was just a theory

253
00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:38.040
which once came to me when I saw the picture. But the story is not ending

254
00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:45.040
because I gave away somehow the negative and when you gave away the negative

255
00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:51.040
that's it, you lost the photo or even the photo I lost somewhere or gave to

256
00:30:51.040 --> 00:31:00.040
somebody. And also some years later, Ian suddenly gave me a present of

257
00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:07.040
exactly this picture in a frame and I said, what? From where you have this?

258
00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:12.040
And he said, oh, it's from London and it's very popular in England.

259
00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:19.040
I was just flabbergasted because I mean I lost it and so it was coming back

260
00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:27.040
to me and this is a picture from a picture so the quality also is not so

261
00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:36.040
very good. But yeah, this was the picture which is so much a miracle to me.

262
00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:44.040
I mean when I talk about miracles, I don't expect stars falling from heaven

263
00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:53.040
or comets coming to the earth, though I faced once a comet really,

264
00:31:54.040 --> 00:32:02.040
which was interesting. But anyway, these personal stories, they mean so much

265
00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:09.040
to me and miracles are going on here also, especially in Kabela, every second day.

266
00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:15.040
You think something, you desire something and it happens. It's never ending,

267
00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:22.040
but somehow this word miracle loses really its meaning because it's somehow

268
00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:30.040
you're connected, things just happen. But okay, what was the next picture I sent?

269
00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:35.040
So the next picture was Krishna, let me just line it up so I can share it.

270
00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:45.040
This is Yuna in front of a poster.

271
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:54.040
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Funny situation. You see Rajiv Gandhi, that was the election

272
00:32:55.040 --> 00:33:01.040
of Rajiv Gandhi and posters were all around. And if you look at it and my face,

273
00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.040
you will see amazing similarity.

274
00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.040
It's true.

275
00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:10.040
Especially if you see the upper part, though I was not so plumb in the face like him

276
00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:18.040
at that time. Maybe I would resemble him more now, but the children in the street

277
00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:22.040
or people were giggling Rajiv, Rajiv, they could see that.

278
00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:32.040
And there was the puja before and the puja was in Nasik in the house of Dr. Sangwe,

279
00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:45.040
I think you might find it also if you search for the video, Krishna puja 84, 85.

280
00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:54.040
So in this, Shri Mataji was talking first time about Vishwanenwala Dharma.

281
00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:59.040
She said, oh, people ask me, is it a religion? Yes, of course, it's the religion,

282
00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:08.040
it's the pure universal religion and to make it short, we can call it Vishwa Nirmala Dharma,

283
00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:14.040
the pure religion, universal religion in the name of Nirmala.

284
00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:21.040
So according to that, you will be called Nirmalites, like Christians according to Christ

285
00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.040
are called Christians and you will be Nirmalites.

286
00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:33.040
Applause and laughing and such an easy going atmosphere, especially because in that talk also she,

287
00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:42.040
because marriages were on the way in the tour and some people were already quite tense about it maybe.

288
00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:51.040
And she made up this story about husband and wife and the differences

289
00:34:51.040 --> 00:35:01.040
and I think it wasn't that puja when she said, you know, man, they don't know anything

290
00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:09.040
but you have to know how to handle the man and let's say the man wants to plant a coconut tree.

291
00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:19.040
And you know that the climate and the garden is not made for this, so you don't object,

292
00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:25.040
you don't confront the man with your opinion because you know better what you don't say,

293
00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:32.040
but what you do is you plant the mango tree. When the mangoes come out, the man will say,

294
00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:39.040
look, the coconut is getting mongrose. She was saying it in a very funny way,

295
00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:47.040
it was so hilarious and so beautiful talking about the differences of man and woman,

296
00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:57.040
which she did later on so often and which is I think so important in nowadays time

297
00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:03.040
where everything, the modern world wants to deny all these differences to such an extent,

298
00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:11.040
it's completely ridiculous. So I think one day in Cabela we should collect all her talks about

299
00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:20.040
man and woman because it's really so meaningful, so interesting and such a,

300
00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:32.040
to say, another aspect in modern life or an aspect of life which is missing today.

301
00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:40.040
There was such a collection. I got married in 1990 and I was given the marriage book,

302
00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:47.040
which I've lent sadly to somebody else so I no longer have it, but it had all these

303
00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:53.040
Shamash's talks in there and how to handle the husbands.

304
00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:57.040
How to handle the husbands, yes.

305
00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:04.040
There's one famous talk also in Germany where Gregoire would say,

306
00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:15.040
oh Shamash, is there any good point in being a man? And she said with a very funny gesture and smile,

307
00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:23.040
there may be. And everybody was flat. Is there any point being a man?

308
00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:34.040
Gregoire said. Well, whatever. But the story about this is not ending because in the end of that Krishna pooja,

309
00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:44.040
as you could see in the video before, Shrimadaji was asking people to fix her on the bindi with open eyes

310
00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:50.040
and not flickering the eyes and concentrating on her bindi like that.

311
00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:58.040
So I was sitting 20 meters just straight towards Shrimadaji and I did it in the end of the pooja.

312
00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:06.040
I fixed her completely. And then that point, I mean, she was really answering that look.

313
00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:12.040
And sometimes we all feel Shrimadaji looked at us, looked at us during the pooja, but this was just,

314
00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:23.040
she was just staring at me like I was staring on her bindi. And then I went to a state which was celestial,

315
00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:30.040
not from this world and absolutely I could not bear it anymore after some time. It was for seconds maybe,

316
00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:37.040
but it was so intensive I could not bear it and I closed my eyes. But it was so beautiful.

317
00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:48.040
And then when we get out of that, that's when I come back to the picture of this Rajiv Gandhi.

318
00:38:49.040 --> 00:39:02.040
I had this dick and was dressed as you could see and I was putting myself very serious next to the poster,

319
00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:12.040
though I was not serious at all. Inside it was just, I mean, it was just beautiful, the state after the pooja.

320
00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:19.040
So I did it deliberately, but I stood there like a statue and stood next to it and then immediately children came,

321
00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:34.040
Rajiv, Rajiv, Rajiv, it was a big fun. So this is about, yeah, this is a special moment, it's not a miracle,

322
00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:44.040
but it's a special moment where the depth was so intense and the fun and the joy was parallel to that.

323
00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:55.040
And it's not a contradiction and I want, if people see these reports of us, of yogis from past who saw so many incidents of Shri Mataji talking,

324
00:39:56.040 --> 00:40:08.040
personally, I want really new people also to know that Shri Mataji had this both sides, this very much down to earth side

325
00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:29.040
and the complete diving into the deepest moments was always her aim, that she makes us worthy to be presented to the Almighty,

326
00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:40.040
as customs at one time told it in Ganapati Puri, means to be not only thoughtless, but to have such an ananda, the real joy of the Spirit.

327
00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:49.040
And that was there and it was really joy and worldly joy at the same time. So it really was fantastic.

328
00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:55.040
Yeah, so what was the next picture? Did I send you?

329
00:40:55.040 --> 00:41:01.040
Not some picture, but you said, you mentioned when we were talking before about an incident in Prague?

330
00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:18.040
Oh, yeah, Prague. Prague was near to Munich, it was not so far, so we went to go to the program, the Shri Mataji gave the program there, public program.

331
00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:28.040
So during these two days, some of us, I don't know who was with us, definitely the leaders at that time,

332
00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:41.040
went with Shri Mataji to a dinner or lunch in one of these huge restaurants, you know, Prague is a place of,

333
00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:57.040
what do you call it, Jugendstil, I don't know, this floral art of the beginning of last century is a lot like these windows.

334
00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:01.040
The Muchada, is it Anuvo, I think it is?

335
00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:03.040
Jugendstil?

336
00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:10.040
Jugendstil, Art Deco, I think, whatever. Yeah, and they have a lot of decorations like this.

337
00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:18.040
So one of these huge restaurants, we went and from the lower part there was a huge staircase going up in the upper room,

338
00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:25.040
so you could look down like a gallery and we were sitting there actually with 12 of us,

339
00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:31.040
6 on the one side, 6 on the other side and Shri Mataji on the top of the table.

340
00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:35.040
So it was really feeling like the last supper you can say.

341
00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:44.040
And when I tell you the story you can feel that it was like that,

342
00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:51.040
like what Christ had with His disciples was not more than we had in that moment.

343
00:42:51.040 --> 00:43:02.040
Because one moment Shri Mataji put her attention on a chandelier which was hanging from the gallery down in the staircase area

344
00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:14.040
and how it was exactly, but there were mirrors from both the sides of this chandelier reflecting the chandelier in infinity.

345
00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:24.040
You know all this, if you go to a lift with mirrors inside you can see yourself reflected in infinity.

346
00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:32.040
And so this chandelier also was reflected in the mirrors like in infinity.

347
00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:40.040
And then she said, you know, this is how the creation took place.

348
00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:49.040
There was Shiva and Shakti on both sides and they put Ganesha in between and mirrored Him in infinity.

349
00:43:50.040 --> 00:44:04.040
So the whole creation is like the infinite mirror of Ganesha which is the role model for us but for the whole creation so to say.

350
00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:13.040
So and she was sitting like this in the end of the table putting her arm on the table, doing like this.

351
00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:20.040
There's photos which I always wanted to have, I don't know who, I think Herbert Reininger in Austria had them.

352
00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:26.040
She was doing like this and we all closed our eyes, she closed her eyes and we all closed her eyes

353
00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:31.040
and it was again one of these magic moments with point and complete thoughtlessness.

354
00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:45.040
And we felt the absolute truth in what she said. I mean this is always when she spoke this eternal truth that you just go into thoughtlessness

355
00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:56.040
and there's no way of analyzing it, you just dive into the truth of it and that was one of these moments.

356
00:44:56.040 --> 00:45:10.040
Yeah. After this I think there was a story which she recalled not only one time that she was flying to Vienna from there

357
00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:24.040
and somehow she was not treated very well and some are from the customs I think and Wolfgang had to cry.

358
00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:31.040
Wolfgang from Austria, Wolfgang Hucker and then rain was pouring down and she said, you know, with your tears,

359
00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:44.040
maybe even the clouds open and so this is a little bi-story so to say. Yeah, that was it.

360
00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:53.040
Did you want to tell, you mentioned a show when we were talking before. Is that some special significance to you?

361
00:45:54.040 --> 00:46:07.040
Yeah, that's, I wanted to tell you a very short moment in my life which seems to be so maybe irrelevant,

362
00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:14.040
you see what it was, but for me it was, for my emotions, for my left, it was a big thing.

363
00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:27.040
We had gone to the Riga which is a hill station with a cable in Switzerland, also during the course of the pooja

364
00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:35.040
and that was a miracle by itself because it was completely full, you couldn't see your hands on the way up.

365
00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:45.040
When Szymonzio arrived on the top of the hill, in this hill station, pure sun, and then she said we come to have havan there

366
00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:59.040
and we prepared on the side of it, of this area, we prepared the fire and she asked us to get some leaves to decorate the fireplace

367
00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:08.040
but there was not many leaves, there was just grass in this area, but there was a bush on the slope which was going really deep down

368
00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:21.040
but it was just one metre away from the edge so I just reached out to get these leaves and she was very close by,

369
00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:37.040
maybe three metres or so and she said, take care Thomas. This was it, she took my name, she was caring and it was such a relief for my heart

370
00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:47.040
because I mean, I don't want to talk about the feeling I had before, sometimes you don't feel you're up to the mark.

371
00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:57.040
In the 80s there were some groups coming up in Switzerland and if you were a little bit feeling outside you feel bad or whatever, we are just childish

372
00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:05.040
but with this she opened the whole cosmos of my heart and it was just a little story about that.

373
00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:23.040
But the shawl, the shawl was when we had puja here in Kabela so there was the kitchen still downstairs in the, no it was also still on the bridge, yes.

374
00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:42.040
The first pujas were on the bridge and once there was fires with iron plates directly on the wood fire and she might as well sit on the entrance of the, the upper entrance of the castle

375
00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:56.040
and she was sitting on this big seat and so some ladies were there cooking, preparing, I don't know, biryani maybe or what and I was looking for the potatoes, I don't know

376
00:48:56.040 --> 00:49:11.040
but in any way I was going forth and back and then the pots were brought to her to put something inside, you know like herbs or spices.

377
00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:22.040
So also she was chewing something, maybe cardamon or what which had to be opened by her teeth and she took it and put it inside.

378
00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:38.040
She said I hope you don't mind if I, because nobody minds but I mean she said like that and then, then I was sitting on this bench which was a stone bench on the entrance of the castle which you might know

379
00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:55.040
where nowadays people always wait. So I was sitting just beside her and she was putting these things inside the pots and stirring and I was just, complete admiration of the situation of this fire and she might as well be there

380
00:49:55.040 --> 00:50:18.040
and I said, it matters but it's just like a pooja. She said yes of course it's just the way how to look at it, how you look at it and this again is something so simple but so important if you think of it, if you nowadays sometimes face an over ritualistic attitude

381
00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:38.040
or I would say a tendency, sorry to say it here but it's a good chance to say it here but Sahaja Yoga is not Hinduism and there is a certain tendency to, to, to put too much Hinduism inside yoga because

382
00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:44.040
Yeah and to make things too elaborate I think there's a tendency to make things more elaborate than they need to be.

383
00:50:44.040 --> 00:51:13.040
Yes and ritualistic and whatever you have to know exactly what the coconut is for and when to use this and when to use this and just it goes on my nerves sometimes I must say. I mean if I can, if it goes on my nerves normally nothing goes on my nerves so much but I can, I can say it's, I don't like that very much and you should be a little bit careful that you don't go into that ritualism.

384
00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:22.040
But whatever. So why did you say that? Yeah that, that expresses.

385
00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:28.040
So just in that moment she was just, Shimachi was just cooking but it was like a puja.

386
00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:31.040
No, no, no that she was cooking, she was cooking.

387
00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:35.040
Yeah but it was the same depth, same depth as a puja isn't it?

388
00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:51.040
Yeah I said, Shimadaji it's just like a puja because this, you know, this tearing, putting something inside like a ritual, like something like you put kukum, you put this, and I said it's just like a puja and I really felt it like this.

389
00:51:51.040 --> 00:52:14.040
And she said yes, it's just a question how you look at it. And this throws a light on this question how much you have to have real exact rituals to, to enhance the vibrations, to get the vibrations coming out or how much is it authentic feeling of your heart what you put inside the puja.

390
00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:29.040
That's what I want to express. But one of the puja's, I was building, I was a fireplace man, later I became a salesman in the area of fireplaces and I knew how to build them also.

391
00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:46.040
So I built a pizza oven down at the lower part of the kitchen in the castle and I was sitting with Hermann, an architect from Austria. After the puja I was sitting together with her, the two of us sitting before her.

392
00:52:46.040 --> 00:53:01.040
She wanted to discuss something about the staircase in the reception room with the dining room in the castle, which was not there at that moment, but we both did not get it from the plans we had before us.

393
00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:15.040
We could not understand and how she could know that this staircase nowadays is a complete normal thing and how she could see that, I mean, from the plans is just amazing.

394
00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:29.040
Even an architect could not follow that. But then suddenly she said, Thomas, you got this pizza oven, I should give you something. Then talking again.

395
00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:40.040
Then one moment she had herself covered with a shawl, which was, I mean, her body is not so big and the shawl covered her mostly.

396
00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:52.040
And I was looking at her and she said, she's so beautiful, looks so new, I don't know how I expressed exactly. And she said, oh, you can have it.

397
00:53:53.040 --> 00:54:03.040
I said, shouldn't I? I didn't want to say that. And then she took it off her and threw it on me two meters away.

398
00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:24.040
I had no chance to then accepting it. So this holy peace, I keep it with me, of course. And that was also, of course, a big blessing, but also showing her easy way to make people happy.

399
00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:36.040
And to learn from her, not only the generosity, but the need that another person has, the need for love and when to give it and how to give it to somebody.

400
00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:52.040
And we really should try to copy her in that, in this special, I mean, as I said, it's not only generosity, of course it is, but it's more generosity of the heart to see the other person's need.

401
00:54:52.040 --> 00:55:01.040
So it was really fantastic. Yeah, that's about the shawl, I just keep still keep it at home.

402
00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:14.040
So you also sent me some photographs that you've taken around Kabela's. I'm just going to share the first one now.

403
00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:29.040
See, these are really miraculous. And I still cannot believe it sometimes. This was just in Kazele here, Apukarvela, in the back of the store. I don't even know where it was exactly.

404
00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:53.040
But as you can see, very clearly, there is a big elephant with an eye, and the small one behind. The one in the left side, you cannot see so clearly, but still you can see the trunk, you can see the part of the ear, you can see the eye. And you can see that?

405
00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:55.040
Yes, yes, I can see it. Yeah.

406
00:55:55.040 --> 00:56:18.040
It's just a root coming off before a piece of stone wall or so. But this is all over, and especially in the rocks in Kanta Gubo, the place before Kabela.

407
00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:32.040
Sorry, Thomas, I'm just looking now again at this and really the eye, especially the eye of the second, of the smaller elephant is just full of compassion again, now it seems to me.

408
00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:51.040
Yeah, yeah, I mean, if you see the eye, you can see the whole person, so to say. And so these rocks, which are before Kabela, after years, somebody said to her, Srimadaji, is it the Swayambhu, these rocks?

409
00:56:51.040 --> 00:57:09.040
And she said, you found out this now, as if it was completely clear to everybody. But actually from Germany, when we came to the first puja here, when the castle was bought, we went by bus, I mean, 40 people or so.

410
00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:24.040
That was the good old times when people really were collective. I hope sometimes these things will come back. Nowadays everybody comes with cars or planes. But we went with the bus and we came in the middle of the night, full moon.

411
00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:46.040
Must have been a group of people. Full moon and the moon shining on these rocks. And they look like big claws of huge animals. It was amazing. Just this introduction into the valley was just amazing. And you can see a lot of elephant heads and Ganesha's there.

412
00:57:47.040 --> 00:58:11.040
I think also, in a second, I just want to say that I always find that when we're coming through the valleys, that it looks like the folds of elephant skin to me as well. You have the elephant skin folds around. Dara just put a note that she said that of those two, the smaller one looks like the baby. And she says in Switzerland, there's a waterfall with the same mummy and baby.

413
00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:13.040
Elephant.

414
00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:22.040
So I'm going to share now this, the one that I have, the second picture. Maybe you can just tell us a little bit about that.

415
00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:45.040
Ah, look. Before one pooja, about four years ago, I had a foot soak just before the pooja. And I looked in the river and before me it was like a heart shape. Just if you turn this around, it looked like a heart shape. I took the stone and turned it around and I was shocked.

416
00:58:45.040 --> 00:59:13.040
I mean, what you see, can it be more clear? I put with a little bit oil dots where the eyes are there anyway. And the trunk on the left side, which is one trunk on the left side, was there anyway. But I made it a little bit more clear with some water or oil to show it better. But isn't it amazing?

417
00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:21.040
It is amazing. I thought it must have been a sculpture or something when I was looking at it. I didn't realize it was just a stone you'd found.

418
00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:42.040
It's just a stone. I keep it at home on my altar. And I don't know, it means something that you're given that. And actually we all should be more innocent, maybe like children. But this was just a spontaneous find.

419
00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:48.040
But to show the next one, the next one is for me also the one in the...

420
00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:51.040
Yeah, yeah. Oh no, I have a tree?

421
00:59:52.040 --> 01:00:01.040
The tree is actually next to our place in Germany, but also quite interesting because...

422
01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.040
Yeah, you will see.

423
01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:17.040
Aha, there you see it. I didn't put the lines to make it more clear. Well, you can see, maybe you have a...

424
01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:20.040
No, I don't have a pointer, I'm sorry.

425
01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:22.040
If I move the cursor, you cannot see that.

426
01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.040
No.

427
01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:25.040
Actually in the middle of the...

428
01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.040
Can you see my cursor?

429
01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.040
Yeah, I can see.

430
01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.040
Okay.

431
01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:35.040
Yes, yes, I can see. Move it up a little bit. Up, up, up, up, left. No, no, not too much up.

432
01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:44.040
There's a trunk. There's a teeth on the one side, on the left side.

433
01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.040
A tusk.

434
01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:49.040
Yeah, down there, under the cursor.

435
01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:54.040
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the tusk and this is the trunk, obviously, no?

436
01:00:54.040 --> 01:01:00.040
And the trunk, you can see, it goes down and it's further on, laying.

437
01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:04.040
Oh, yes. Yeah. Wow.

438
01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:06.040
And there's a deep one eye.

439
01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:07.040
There's the eye.

440
01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:10.040
Yes. And you have sort of...

441
01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:12.040
Or is this the eye?

442
01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:19.040
You have Shiva and Shakti, as Shimadali explained it, and they put Ganesha...

443
01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.040
On either side of Ganesha.

444
01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:30.040
Yeah, so the tree is going in. So that was quite near to our place at home.

445
01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:41.040
So let me show you the next one. The next one is in Kabela also, but in Monjardino,

446
01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:48.040
there's a hotel. There's a hotel where we often stayed before.

447
01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:58.040
Yeah. And there's a little brook, a little river, which has hardly any water, but it's washed out

448
01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:04.040
and you can see, sitting on the roots of the tree...

449
01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:10.040
Under the roots of the tree is sitting the baby Ganesha.

450
01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:18.040
And you will see it in the next picture where I've made the lines to make it even more clear.

451
01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:23.040
Well, the next one is without the lines. It's just more closer, you'll see.

452
01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:27.040
Do you have the one with the lines?

453
01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:34.040
Well, I just show this one first. This is a closer up of it. So that people can maybe see it without the lines joining.

454
01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:41.040
Yeah, you can see the trunk with your cursor and there's the one. Yeah.

455
01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:45.040
So now I'll show it where you've joined it in.

456
01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:46.040
Yeah.

457
01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:56.040
And actually, this looks exactly how...

458
01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:07.040
Yeah. The ear really, you can see on the photo before, the ear on the left side is very clearly distinct from the other stone.

459
01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:14.040
The eyes is dark, the left eye you can see clearly, the right eye, I made it very little bit clear.

460
01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:21.040
But this looks exactly how they show the Ashtavinaayaka, the baby elephants in Maharashtra.

461
01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:28.040
They are also a little bit vague or a little bit abstract. They look like that, so to say.

462
01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:34.040
And as he was sitting here under the roots of the tree that was so symbolic.

463
01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:41.040
So, I mean, I don't know, I didn't look for all these, it just happened.

464
01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:49.040
This is the most miraculous thing. I don't go around with the camera to look, oh, do I find something like this?

465
01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:56.040
Yeah. Anything else? What is the time?

466
01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:01.040
I have no more. It's five minutes to the hour.

467
01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:03.040
Yeah.

468
01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:06.040
I don't think I have any more questions for you.

469
01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:13.040
Maybe somebody else wants to ask the question or what?

470
01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:26.040
Thanks, Thomas. It's amazing. When you listen to these stories, you feel like all the deities are sitting here with us.

471
01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:34.040
And there's this, you feel like Mother's here also with us. It's just, thanks so much.

472
01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:43.040
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I hope, of course, that I can convey a little bit the feelings I had in this time.

473
01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:50.040
It shows people who come after us, who come after those people who met Shri Mataji in person,

474
01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:57.040
that they can imagine a little bit the atmosphere and the moments that we shared with her.

475
01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:09.040
And if, I mean, one time I was sitting in Kabela with two Germans whom I hardly knew, and we started to talk.

476
01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:16.040
And everybody was like in competition to tell the stories. It was unbelievable.

477
01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:26.040
And if I just see this moment where some people which I hardly knew told stories that you just cannot imagine,

478
01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:38.040
then how much more we all can contribute to these kind of miraculous stories.

479
01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:47.040
And not only miraculous, but also to throw a light on what it meant for our lives.

480
01:05:48.040 --> 01:06:04.040
Because, you know, Shri Mataji was an expert in so many things that one time I wanted to write something about how much she was a specialist.

481
01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:17.040
Be it in architecture, be it in psychology, be it in relations between husband and wife, be it in politics.

482
01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:25.040
I mean, it's just amazing if you just, sorry to say, but just hear her talks.

483
01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:40.040
Sometimes you cannot grasp the worldly personality also, how much knowledge she had, how much she could work through her complete intuition.

484
01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:48.040
And that's why I said sometimes you don't have a feeling she had ever a right side to express something from her right side.

485
01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:57.040
Everything came from the intuition and the inspiration. And this I have the feeling we should copy that.

486
01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:08.040
Nowadays you sometimes feel so many opinions about things. May it be wars or may it be the virus or whatever it is.

487
01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:18.040
I mean, people discuss, they come together, they discuss about their jobs or this. What's so interesting about it?

488
01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:30.040
It's just like usual people, they come to a party, they discuss the negativity of the money in the state and the tax and whatever.

489
01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:40.040
This is so irrelevant. I mean, I have the feeling we can be very much in this world, but not to be from this world.

490
01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:52.040
I mean, like it is in the Bible said, in this world so we can know all these things. We should be informed, as you said, you should read the news,

491
01:07:52.040 --> 01:08:02.040
know about everything in the world, but at the same time be very detached and don't make it an issue in your head, especially not in your vibrations.

492
01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:15.040
But go to this watchful state of witnessing and from that changing the world, maybe if we can.

493
01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:24.040
Because in this witness state we are in the deep concern without being involved into it.

494
01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:38.040
And so we might change the world more than we know, I don't know, but it's worth trying not to judge or not to be involved, but to just witness.

495
01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:47.040
But certainly, Shamasha can only work through us when we're detached, when we're in a witness state.

496
01:08:48.040 --> 01:09:06.040
Yeah, that's very true. I once had a vision of what one could make a piece of art out of that or a picture that when she went away from us, she was going,

497
01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:15.040
I had this idea, she is going around the world like a layer of a special aura around the world and she's everywhere there.

498
01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:32.040
And whenever somebody goes in the witness state deeply, then this power of her flows like a, what do you call this, when you put juice in a bottle,

499
01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:47.040
you use something like this, what you call that. It's a funnel. A funnel, yeah. So I was imagining to have a funnel and this blessing pouring in and the knowledge pouring into yourself.

500
01:09:47.040 --> 01:10:03.040
It would be nice to make a picture like that once, a yogi sitting there and you see Shri Mataji's power flowing into him when he's going into this deep state of meditation.

501
01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:09.040
Well, I shall remember that image now, Thomas, when I'm meditating, definitely.

502
01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:15.040
Well, I'm not an artist, I cannot, but I could imagine it could be a nice picture.

503
01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:39.040
Okay, that's it. Thank you so much for having me and yeah, I think many, many of us should write down their stories, also make this kind of interview or tell them stories.

504
01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:43.040
Somebody's raised a hand, but please just open your mic and speak.

505
01:10:45.040 --> 01:11:06.040
I just wanted to say that there is now a light that's from what I can see anyway, there's a light that's shining on the photograph behind you, Thomas.

506
01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:10.040
There's a light shining there.

507
01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:18.040
No, no, on the other side, Thomas, on the deities dancing, I think you mean, isn't it?

508
01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.040
Yeah.

509
01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:34.040
I don't know, I cannot see, I see my picture only in small, so I cannot really see what you mean, but in any case, here comes again the doubting Thomas.

510
01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:51.040
And I put some lights in the room and of course they do give also from above some light, but whatever it is, I mean, actually, we don't need this outer light because we have it all inside.

511
01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:02.040
Well, I can just say that my Saazara is beautifully open, so thank you very much for that.

512
01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:09.040
I thank you so much. If this is the result, I'm very, very happy. Thank you so much. So we quit.

513
01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:12.040
Yes, I'm just going to stop the recording.
