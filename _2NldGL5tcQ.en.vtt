Shri Krishna Puja
Cabella Ligure, Italy

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.430
August 16, 1992

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:39.900
Today we have decided to have the puja of
Shri Krishna.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:52.819
We have many a times done this puja and have
understood the essence of Shri Krishna’s

00:08:52.819 --> 00:08:56.799
advent, which was six thousand years back.

00:08:56.799 --> 00:09:15.800
And now, what His manifestation was, what
He wanted to be accomplished has to be done

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.110
in this Kali Yuga.

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:31.790
As it is, this Kali Yuga is going into a new
realm of Satya Yuga, but in between there

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:44.479
is Krita Yuga where this Brahmachaitanya,
or we can say the all-pervading Power of God’s

00:09:44.479 --> 00:09:47.600
love, is going to act.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:58.670
At this time, what is going to happen with
Shri Krishna’s powers – this is what we

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:01.100
have to see.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:07.119
Shri Krishna, as I told you, was the incarnation
also of diplomacy.

00:10:07.119 --> 00:10:16.179
So He plays around quite a lot, and ultimately
He brings forth the untruth and the falsehood;

00:10:16.179 --> 00:10:18.229
but in doing that He judges people.

00:10:18.229 --> 00:10:26.579
So it’s very important that Shri Krishna’s
powers of His diplomacy were to be manifesting

00:10:26.579 --> 00:10:32.109
at this time, when it is the Last Judgment.

00:10:32.109 --> 00:10:45.960
So now whatever we have done wrong before,
whatever karmas which have been done in ignorance

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:53.690
maybe, or maybe deliberately, all of them
will be paid back.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:11:01.910
Those punyas which you have done in previous
lives, this life, will be also rewarded.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:10.570
This is all done through Shri Krishna’s
principles of collectivity, where He collectively

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:13.840
sees the situation.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:26.050
For example, as I told you last time also
that Columbus luckily went to America; luckily,

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:30.870
so we were saved, otherwise we would not have
been here.

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:40.310
And then these Spanish people, bullfighters,
they went and started fighting the poor, unarmed

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:46.680
people who were just very simple owners of
that land.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:52.570
But they went and occupied those lands, and
killed every one of them.

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:57.980
So in America you can’t find anyone, no
doubt, but even in South America you have

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:05.390
to go to Colombia or to Bolivia, to great
heights, to see some aboriginals there; otherwise

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:08.940
most of them are finished.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:14.060
So now in Krita Yuga all these diseases have
started cropping up.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:22.130
But the best part is the drug addiction.

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:31.700
These drugs are made, for your information,
in Bolivia and in Colombia.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:39.860
You drove them down there, so now you have
the drugs and very nicely you are very welcoming

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.590
them.

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:53.010
People went in Nicaragua to help them and
brought back all these horrible drugs to Washington;

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:58.730
and in every elite society they are just discussing
which is the best drug, where is the sale

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:02.630
on and where should they buy the drugs.

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:08.990
So the all of America is now worried how much
drug they can import, and kill themselves

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:11.560
and destroy themselves.

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:17.720
So this destruction has started from inside.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:24.570
Then in addition to that, when I went there
first I told them not to indulge into these

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:40.540
Freudian practices but keep to morality, otherwise
you’ll have problems.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:52.790
So they had first AIDS, secondly now yuppie’s
disease, and all kinds of secret diseases

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.370
they have.

00:13:55.370 --> 00:14:00.609
Among ten people there would be at least one
person who is suffering from that, and among

00:14:00.609 --> 00:14:05.870
twenty people there’ll be at least one person
who must be suffering from schizophrenia.

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:14.950
Because they made every person, every other
country nervous, so now they are getting schizophrenia.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:20.200
Like this we can see even in England.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:32.210
Now in England they came to India as traders,
ordinary traders, and plundered us completely,

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:38.370
no doubt, ruled us for three hundred years
– as I say, it’s gracious hospitality

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:46.070
they had – and then they left us in three
pieces.

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:50.810
And now in their own country there are problems,
all kinds.

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:58.980
First of all nobody wants to call themselves
as English; they all call themselves Welsh

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:03.680
or Scots, or specially the Irish.

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:08.340
And there is always a bomb scare in London,
every time, and for our first program also

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.109
there was a bomb scare.

00:15:11.109 --> 00:15:17.280
So you can imagine these English who tried
to divide us are automatically divided among

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.730
themselves, and now fighting each other.

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:26.160
But there are other problems also like AIDS
and immoral life, everything like that.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.490
Same with the French.

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:35.790
French tried to sell their wine all over,
and bring their horrible bathroom culture

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:36.990
everywhere.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.600
Now they are suffering from it.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:45.389
For example, most of the time they’re drunk
and they have lost all moorings, I mean, they

00:15:45.389 --> 00:15:47.780
have no sense left in their heads.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:53.740
Like a housewife could be a prostitute – allowed
by law.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.590
All such things are happening.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:02.460
Now they are paying, and the worst that they
are paying, all these countries who think

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:06.000
no end of themselves, are recession.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.100
This is also Shri Krishna’s power, because
He’s Kubera.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.750
He’s the one who is the power of wealth.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:21.980
He gave lot of wealth to all these countries,
and now they don’t know what to do with

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:22.980
themselves.

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:28.669
We can see in these fifty years how many things
have happened, but specially these twenty

00:16:28.669 --> 00:16:31.050
years have been really remarkable.

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:41.330
All over the world you can find out there
has been some sort of a complete change, or

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:42.600
an exposure.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:54.040
Even in Italy you see every day this Vatican
is here exposed, or some mafia connections

00:16:54.040 --> 00:17:00.372
are there, or this what you call, people from
the government are exposed.

00:17:00.372 --> 00:17:08.240
I am doing nothing, I’m just sitting here,
but it is working out that way.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:12.340
Since I have been here I don’t know how
many people have gone to jail, God knows.

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:16.240
(I don’t know if she’s not brought My
throat pastilles.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:24.470
I had a bath early in the morning, so a little
bit … This is, Shri Krishna is trying to

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:28.850
fill Me up!)

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:46.360
We Indians are also suffering,because our
past deeds – like we had a caste system.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:50.740
So now the caste system has become the greatest
headache for us in India, that’s the greatest

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:52.840
cancer for us.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:18:02.890
Like that, everywhere these twenty years or
twenty-one years have been … ( … I don’t

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:07.680
know, because morning.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:24.370
Also reaction on Me … ) So like that in
every country, you’ll see gradually, every

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:31.520
country will have to face for what it has
done.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:42.450
Also Shri Krishna’s own style was that He
can never believed in caste system.

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:52.130
He Himself was born in a caste which is a,
what you call is a milkman’s caste, and

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:59.320
then He became a king, of course; but to begin
with, and He lived like an ordinary person.

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:05.910
He used to take the cows outside, look after
them and bring them home.

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:15.520
Now if you see His life you’ll find He is
absolutely very human, the way He used to

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.050
tease His mother, tease other ladies.

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:24.540
All this is extremely human and childlike,
and extremely sweet.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:28.559
But behind that also there was a great significance.

00:19:28.559 --> 00:19:36.760
For example, Shri Radha – as you know, She
was Mahalakshmi – and as Mahalakshmi She

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:43.670
used to put Her feet, take bath in the river
Yamuna, and the ladies would take water from

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:47.740
the same river, carry on their head the pitchers.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:54.880
Now Shri Krishna wanted to raise their kundalini,
so He used to hit them from the back so that

00:19:54.880 --> 00:20:01.640
the water falls on their back, and that vibrated
water would raise their kundalini.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:05.830
This was His childish trick, but it had a
meaning.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:11.499
Another one, when we see Him in ras – “ra”
means energy.

00:20:11.499 --> 00:20:17.309
Radha: “ra” is “energy,” “dha”
means “the one who sustains it” – so

00:20:17.309 --> 00:20:21.190
it is Radhaji who had the energy.

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:28.690
“Sa” means “with,” so when they played
ras, was nothing but to play with the energy.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:34.170
And that’s how He wanted to have a collective
awakening of people, of gopa and gopis, and

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:35.590
He did it.

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:38.900
But then He had to leave and fight this Kamsa.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:46.530
In His own lifetime, as a child or grown-up,
He punished all kinds of devils and women

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:50.970
devils who were like Putna, and all that.

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:56.210
He did it, and in this Kali Yuga also He’s
active.

00:20:56.210 --> 00:21:03.140
We have seen how gradually He has finished
so many false gurus, one by one; somebody

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:08.239
who called himself Shri Krishna, somebody
who called himself as God, something else,

00:21:08.239 --> 00:21:09.239
something else.

00:21:09.239 --> 00:21:14.179
He finished them all, exposed them nicely,
and now we have very few people in the arena

00:21:14.179 --> 00:21:18.100
left for us to fight.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.780
They themselves are trembling and they are
quite frightened of us, because we are standing

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:26.340
on truth.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:34.920
So now, when we have to think about Shri Krishna
who is residing in our Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:41.840
Many people have this problem of left Vishuddhi.

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:50.150
That is because we are more sort of very social
people.

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:56.520
Now in the Western society, the social system
is so rigid that anybody can collapse with

00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:03.140
that, or used to be; now better because of
the, maybe the revolt, anti-culture.

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:09.869
But otherwise if you could put one spoon from
here to there, then you are finished.

00:22:09.869 --> 00:22:16.050
If you start your food with, say, not with
the fish knife but with an ordinary knife,

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:18.460
then you’re finished, you are no good.

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:26.480
And these French have made even much worse
by using a big science out of alcohol.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:33.820
For this alcohol this is the glass, for that
alcohol that is the glass, and all that.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:37.790
So the whole collective was made so rigid.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:40.270
It’s much more rigid than in India.

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:46.020
I used to think Indian collective is quite
rigid because of certain conditionings we

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:57.530
have, but after coming to the West I was surprised
that it is such a conditioning in the heads

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:04.239
of the people, that some of the conditionings
you cannot remove – say from Catholic Church,

00:23:04.239 --> 00:23:06.940
you might say, or from wherever it is.

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:15.441
But when it comes from somebody like Freud
who was absolutely a devil, they just give

00:23:15.441 --> 00:23:19.230
up all these conditionings and take to that.

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:26.220
I cannot understand any country where there
is Catholic Church so predominant, they are

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.410
following Freud.

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:37.100
So this collective rigidity, which was then
because maybe Shri Rama was a very formal

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:44.309
person, because of Him maybe the collective
rigidity might have been in India.

00:23:44.309 --> 00:23:50.610
But in the West it is all mental, it’s absolutely
mental.

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:56.360
If you make this kind of hair then you are
all right, if you put oil then you are absolutely

00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:03.980
lunatic: all kinds of funny ideas were given,
and people started doing like this.

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:05.410
If you don’t put oil at all you’ll become
bald.

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:09.630
If you become bald, then they will have a
business of their wigs.

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:15.520
So the whole thing was money-oriented, and
everything was made so fixed that you had

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.570
to do it so that they could sell their things.

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:23.730
England was, as you know, is tailcoat: you
have to wear a tailcoat if you have to see

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:24.730
the Queen.

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:30.320
I don’t know why you have to wear a tailcoat
to see the Queen, but it’s compulsory, and

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.230
if you don’t wear then you are not allowed.

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:38.071
So they have to borrow these tailcoats and
all that from one shop, which can be tight,

00:24:38.071 --> 00:24:44.850
which can be loose, and everybody looks like
Charlie Chaplin to Me!

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:48.280
They can’t walk straight.

00:24:48.280 --> 00:25:01.020
So this kind of stupid rigidity that came
into the West has really made them very nervous.

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:02.480
People are so nervous here.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:11.559
If you tell some lady that “I am going to
come and have food with you,” she will collapse.

00:25:11.559 --> 00:25:18.109
God knows what she thinks, I mean, it is caring
for the public opinion, or her own conditioning.

00:25:18.109 --> 00:25:24.580
But in an Indian, a housewife, if you tell
her you are going to come, she’ll be the

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:26.010
happiest person.

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:30.640
She’ll be very happy that you are coming
to her house for dinner.

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:35.140
But here even if you say, “I would like
to come and see you in the evening,” they’ll

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.270
say, “All right, come in the pub.”

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:44.720
Because they’re so nervous, they’re not
sure of themself; and this has come, I think,

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:48.260
perhaps from these norms that there have been
created in the West.

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:57.220
In India also we had lots of these ritualism
that came up very serious.

00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:05.790
Like we had people, Jainis who’d pick up
their hair with their hands.

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:17.310
They are not supposed to use any knives or
any scissors or any barbers, so they were

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:19.380
supposed to pick up their hair on their own.

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:24.790
So from their beard, from their this thing,
they would pick up all the time.

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:32.170
That went to such a horrible conditioning
that they would say that if you, even if you

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:37.139
breathe then you can, you might consume some
animals.

00:26:37.139 --> 00:26:42.200
So they would put some sort of a cloth before
their mouth, and all kinds of nonsense they

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.610
did.

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:48.310
At that time Shri Krishna came in.

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:55.240
His own cousin was a tirthankara, you’ll
be surprised, Neminath.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:27:04.170
He became a tirthankara, and that made Shri
Krishna think about it, that this kind of

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:06.440
stupid ritualism that we have.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:12.030
Like in the morning women will get up, in
their sleep they will go, put some water for

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:16.200
tulsi, do this thing, that thing, throw water
here and there.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:22.260
And also the untouchables and touchables;
and you can’t take water from this, you

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:29.930
can’t eat this, you can’t move like that
– all kinds of restrictions, timing, everything.

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:33.930
This time is not good, that time is not good,
this you should not do, that you should not

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:45.190
do, to such an extent that the whole movement
of our country was round these rituals.

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:49.250
I had nephews who used to come to Bombay for
their work.

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:52.410
Every time they went to Lucknow, they would
come with shaven heads.

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:54.240
I said, “What’s the matter?”

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.870
He said, “There are many people in our family
who are old, and when they die we have to

00:27:57.870 --> 00:27:58.870
shave our heads.”

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:03.930
So every time they went there somebody died,
so they came with shaven heads.

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:10.250
Like that such horrible rituals existed, and
even now in the South India there is a lot

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:15.110
of rituals are there, terrible rituals, and
they cannot get out of it, they’re frightened.

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:22.590
If they get out of it then they might be sinners,
or they will go to hell.

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:30.800
So the Indian conditioning was, as far as
these rigidities were concerned for religion,

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:38.980
to be on the right side in such a way that
we should not be caught up without doing this.

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:43.940
So early in the morning they’ll get up and
do the rituals, just without even thinking

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:48.540
about what they’re doing.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:54.890
But in the West the lifestyle is nothing but
rigidity, the whole lifestyle is; there’s

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:56.510
no freedom anywhere.

00:28:56.510 --> 00:29:02.330
And all that then was rewarded by these hippies
and other people, and all of them, and they

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:06.510
fought it, and that thing went to another
extremes.

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:11.550
So from one extreme to another extreme they
went.

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:17.910
Now, how Shri Krishna’s advent changed it.

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:28.940
When Shri Krishna came on this Earth, He said
this is all a leela, it is just a play.

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:33.930
Because you are involved into it, you cannot
see the play.

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:41.769
But if you ascend – if you are in the water
you are afraid of the water, but if you get

00:29:41.769 --> 00:29:49.010
into the boat you can see the water, and if
you know how to swim you can even save the

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:51.680
people who are in the water.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:30:00.570
So He says that if you develop a witness state,
sakshi swarupata, if you develop that state

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:04.070
then you see the whole thing as a drama.

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:06.100
Nothing affects you.

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:12.790
Nothing matters, you don’t worry about anything,
you see the problem above; you are, and you

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:16.710
see the problem, and because you are out of
it, you can solve the problem.

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:26.060
This was His great advent, I would say, that
has taught the first step towards the ascent,

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:29.279
is that you have to become a sakshi.

00:30:29.279 --> 00:30:31.779
You have to become the witness.

00:30:31.779 --> 00:30:36.820
Now let’s see in Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:43.470
In Sahaja Yoga there are different types of
people come from different areas, from different

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:48.279
cultures, because the door is open to everyone.

00:30:48.279 --> 00:30:57.550
Now if an Indian comes in, he will be all
the time watchful about others, and will say

00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:02.540
that “Mother, this man is not doing this,
this man is not doing that.

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:04.730
He should have done footsoaking.”

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:12.009
He’ll find faults with others, all the time
saying that this man is not doing like this,

00:31:12.009 --> 00:31:13.750
and you know.

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:18.410
But in the West they start finding faults
with themselves.

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:24.860
And I receive letters, ten to twelve pages
sometimes, confessing what wrong they have

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:25.860
done.

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:30.940
Who is interested to know, what wrongs you
have done?

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:40.850
I mean, if a lotus is born, nobody wants to
know how many filthy things are inside the

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:41.850
pond.

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:45.060
You are now a lotus.

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:52.190
But it’s so common that they think we must
confess, we must tell Mother what wrong we

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:53.190
have done.

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:56.580
Every moment you are changing, so what is
there to confess?

00:31:56.580 --> 00:32:04.730
And the life is so formal, as I told you,
that people suffer from guilt for anything.

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:12.629
Apart from the influence of this Catholic
Church has conditioned you so much that even

00:32:12.629 --> 00:32:17.560
if you are not a Catholic, you’re a Protestant,
still you have guilt, and as a guilt you develop

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:20.100
this left Vishuddhi.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:27.620
So then this left Vishuddhi is Vishnumaya
– means what?

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:35.090
Once you have this left Vishuddhi you develop
all the problems of the Vishnumaya, and one

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:38.350
of them is the heart.

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:46.970
Because Vishnumaya is an active thing, She
is like electricity; and if you have Vishnumaya

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:50.330
problem, then you become lethargic.

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:52.970
“Oh, I’m so guilty.”

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:53.970
You become depressed.

00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:57.940
That Vishnumaya Principle disappears from
you.

00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:06.990
She’s the one who’s quick, fast, and She
gives the light, and announces to the whole

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:09.920
world what Shri Krishna is.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:16.520
While what happens with such people, Sahaja
yogis who come in, who feel guilty, they say,

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:22.450
“Mother, You know, we thought that if we
do this then our ego will come up.

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:29.840
If we do any work outside and work in some
fields or in some villages, then our ego will

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:30.840
come up.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.960
So we don’t want to do it.”

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:35.340
This is absurd.

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:41.050
It’s like you give light to some light,
and the light says that “I don’t want

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:48.649
to give the light, because maybe this light
might develop an ego.”

00:33:48.649 --> 00:33:49.649
It is absurd.

00:33:49.649 --> 00:33:55.450
But such absurd things Sahaja yogis tell Me.

00:33:55.450 --> 00:34:02.029
For them one has to understand, to get out
of this left Vishuddhi is to become absolutely

00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:08.910
dynamic in Sahaja Yoga, go all out into Sahaja
Yoga.

00:34:08.910 --> 00:34:12.139
Otherwise they can’t get rid of their left
Vishuddhis.

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:22.770
Left Vishuddhi is a thing that’s a very
depressive action on the whole being, and

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:30.090
a person who has left Vishuddhi is always
a very slow person to do anything for Sahaja

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:31.090
Yoga.

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.660
You have not been given light to hide it.

00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:39.990
Christ has said that you don’t put light
under the table.

00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:46.860
So you have been given light to work it out,
to be dynamic, to think what to do, how to

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:48.980
arrange, how to organize.

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:54.410
But if you are guilty, then you will all the
time say, “Oh Mother, it’s very difficult,

00:34:54.410 --> 00:35:00.590
You know, this . . .” Always you’ll find
the other side of the whole joke, just to

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:01.590
avoid.

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:04.940
Now for a Sahaja yogi is to witness himself,
first of all.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.290
That is the introspection.

00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:11.460
He should see for himself, “Where was I,
and I have come here.”

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:16.410
Don’t indulge too much in the past, but
see the distance you have crossed in such

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:18.820
a short time.

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:23.670
Now you have come into the Kingdom of God,
you have all the powers.

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:26.170
I don’t tell lies – it’s a fact.

00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:33.149
I’ll give you an example, if Wolfgang allows
Me to say that.

00:35:33.149 --> 00:35:44.389
Wolfgang was with Me when we were traveling
from Prague to Vienna and the plane, you see,

00:35:44.389 --> 00:35:47.899
he told Me that the plane is at ten-thirty,
but it was at nine-thirty; it was a mistake.

00:35:47.899 --> 00:35:52.370
It’s all right, there can be mistake, of
course, that also is Shri Krishna’s style.

00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:56.269
You can always do mistakes, doesn’t matter.

00:35:56.269 --> 00:36:03.070
So we reached – I mean, why all these things
happen, see, to create an event, a ghatna.

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:08.860
So he was very upset about it that he told
Me a wrong time, and I reached there about

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:09.910
fifteen minutes late.

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:14.720
And there was a ground hostess, horrible,
she started shouting at Me, saying all kinds,

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:18.050
“It’s not fair, You don’t know,” this,
that and everything.

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:24.370
I just didn’t bother about it because I
knew that it was out of mistake we’ve done

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:25.370
it.

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:28.200
And they could have taken away their plane
instead of shouting, but they kept the plane

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:36.170
and shouted at Me, because she wanted to shout,
you see.

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:46.490
Then the plane was filled in with people and
it would not leave, so I asked the engineers.

00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:48.509
They said, “It has been like this for the
half-an-hour.

00:36:48.509 --> 00:36:50.320
We are trying to correct it.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.580
It’s like this.”

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:53.270
So it’s all right.

00:36:53.270 --> 00:37:00.950
He said that “We’ll have to wait till
we put it right.”

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:07.430
But because she shouted at Me, Wolfgang was
full of tears, you see; just look at this

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:10.129
German having so many tears in his eyes!

00:37:10.129 --> 00:37:14.080
Then Alga was telling him that “It’s all
right, doesn’t matter.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:15.899
It’s not your mistake.”

00:37:15.899 --> 00:37:21.450
He was feeling so sad that Mother has been
insulted like this by this lady, because of

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:23.779
my mistake – I mean, it’s love.

00:37:23.779 --> 00:37:26.440
Now the power of his love was so great.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:31.499
At the same moment there were so many, to
about fifty people, Sahaja yogis standing

00:37:31.499 --> 00:37:33.240
on the balcony watching us.

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:41.450
We also felt and they also felt, but they
felt a tremendous cool breeze like a big blow

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:47.139
came to them and blew upon them vibrations,
and they just got enamored.

00:37:47.139 --> 00:37:51.570
And suddenly when they opened their eyes what
they find, the whole sky was filled with clouds.

00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:53.850
There was not a single cloud.

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:58.889
In one second, in one second from where the
clouds came, God knows.

00:37:58.889 --> 00:38:01.269
It was all completely filled with them.

00:38:01.269 --> 00:38:05.519
Then they asked us to get out because they
could not do anything.

00:38:05.519 --> 00:38:08.690
So when we came back it started raining.

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:11.610
When we came in, he got after that lady.

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:13.870
He said, “Now, whom are we to shout?

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:16.560
We can’t catch our planes now.”

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:21.980
And then they announced that all the flights
are cancelled.

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:28.440
So see the power of his love for his Mother
that the whole sky couldn’t bear it, you

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:31.649
see, the, his eyes became the sky.

00:38:31.649 --> 00:38:37.200
And in a second they said, “Mother, we have
never seen such a miracle, that there is not

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:42.250
one single thing and the whole thing was filled
with this.”

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:45.610
So you must know your powers.

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:49.629
That is what is – first of all witness yourself,
is the introspection.

00:38:49.629 --> 00:38:54.800
See for yourself how many powers you have
got.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:39:00.540
Now with your left Vishuddhi you will always
conclude, “Oh, how can I have any powers?

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:04.910
After all, I have done this, I have done that.”

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:11.200
Even if you give somebody hundred pounds and
you tell him that now you go to the market,

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:17.320
buy something, he’ll say, “Oh, what’s
the use of this hundred pounds?” this, that.

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.769
Use it!

00:39:18.769 --> 00:39:20.370
As simple as that.

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:25.490
But then Sahaja yogis start saying that “No,
no, no, no.

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:27.170
Mother says, but how can I have?

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:30.060
How can I have these powers, after all?

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:31.340
It’s not possible.

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:32.629
I’m no good.”

00:39:32.629 --> 00:39:37.550
Because that left Vishuddhi’s all the time
telling that you are good for nothing.

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:47.480
It’s like a leaking hole in your brain that
takes away all the sense, and you accept it.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:53.660
So first thing is to introspect yourself,
and see for yourself how many powers you have

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:54.660
got.

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:59.950
Like in the beginning no Sahaja yogi would
give realization, in India.

00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:02.700
Nobody would even touch anyone.

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:08.670
It so happened that My car failed and I was
late two hours, luckily, and there was a big

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:12.029
meeting and they didn’t know what to do,
so they started giving realization to people.

00:40:12.029 --> 00:40:19.040
And then they realized they can give realization;
otherwise they would not touch anyone.

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:22.249
Now you know that what you can do.

00:40:22.249 --> 00:40:26.029
You also know that whatever you say happens.

00:40:26.029 --> 00:40:27.029
Whatever you want you can get it.

00:40:27.029 --> 00:40:28.029
Try, try, try!

00:40:28.029 --> 00:40:33.340
But if you don’t do it, then you’ll be
all the time half-baked.

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:39.129
Take the experience of your powers, see how
dynamic you are.

00:40:39.129 --> 00:40:44.620
Don’t have formalities about it, just use
it fully, and you will be amazed that you

00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:47.379
have so many powers.

00:40:47.379 --> 00:40:50.270
Somebody told Me that “Mother, You have
given a siddhi to Guido.”

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:53.399
I have given siddhi to all of you.

00:40:53.399 --> 00:40:57.610
I never discriminate; but it’s only he is
very brave, he’s used it left and right.

00:40:57.610 --> 00:41:00.009
He uses left and right.

00:41:00.009 --> 00:41:02.769
If you do not use your siddhis, what can I
do?

00:41:02.769 --> 00:41:08.670
I’ve given you all the siddhis, no doubt
about it, so try.

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:12.629
Like in the beginning Baba Mama told Me that
“How can I write a poem?

00:41:12.629 --> 00:41:17.460
I feel like writing but I am rather frightened,
because I could not even write an essay.”

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:23.910
I used to write essay for all My brothers,
you see, when they were studying.

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:27.389
I was very good at languages.

00:41:27.389 --> 00:41:29.389
But that’s what he said, and now look at
him!

00:41:29.389 --> 00:41:32.119
I told him, “You go ahead and write whatever
you write.”

00:41:32.119 --> 00:41:34.650
He said, “I may write something wrong.”

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:35.910
“It doesn’t matter.

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:36.910
Write it.”

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:41.830
In the same way, somebody wants to paint something,
one should not think how they will criticize

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:46.370
or anything – just paint.

00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:47.590
If you want to sing, just sing.

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:52.470
If you want to do anything, any manifestation,
just do it boldly.

00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:54.030
Go in a big way.

00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:57.779
You’ll be amazed at yourself how you have
achieved it and how you are doing it.

00:41:57.779 --> 00:42:01.200
It has worked with so many artists, you know
that.

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:06.810
That day Debu told you about himself, and
in so many they can tell you that this has

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:08.070
happened to them.

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:11.129
So now the first thing is to know that you
have powers.

00:42:11.129 --> 00:42:12.620
Now believe in them.

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:13.670
Have faith in yourself.

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:18.749
If you have left Vishuddhi, this Vishnumaya
won’t work out.

00:42:18.749 --> 00:42:21.070
But be like Vishnumaya.

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:23.010
Just give up this guilt.

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:25.499
“No, I am a Sahaja yogi.

00:42:25.499 --> 00:42:27.950
I’m not an ordinary person.”

00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:32.590
People sometimes talk to Me and I say, “Do
you know what you are?”

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:33.590
“What, Mother?”

00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:35.800
“You are a Sahaja yogi.”

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:38.859
“Oh, I forgot.”

00:42:38.859 --> 00:42:43.959
“Now go and do it.”

00:42:43.959 --> 00:42:51.749
And the another style of this left Vishuddhi
is this, which one must understand, that it

00:42:51.749 --> 00:42:53.489
tries to give an explanation.

00:42:53.489 --> 00:42:57.930
As I told you many a time, you tell somebody
that telephone to someone.

00:42:57.930 --> 00:43:01.119
First they will say, “He may not be there,
Mother.”

00:43:01.119 --> 00:43:02.369
“Baba, you telephone!

00:43:02.369 --> 00:43:08.160
First find out if he may be there or may not
be there.”

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:10.299
But they would not.

00:43:10.299 --> 00:43:13.609
They would just avoid, and that is another
thing.

00:43:13.609 --> 00:43:16.369
Vishnumaya never avoids, you have seen that.

00:43:16.369 --> 00:43:21.920
Once She has to shine She shines, wherever
She is, whatever She is.

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:24.750
So in the same way we have to be like that.

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:31.209
We have to know that we are special people,
we are chosen, we are angelic and that we

00:43:31.209 --> 00:43:35.900
have entered into the Kingdom of God, and
it will all work out.

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:38.870
Sahaja Yoga is not meant for useless people.

00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:44.329
As I told you, in Marathi, Tukaram has said,
“Yeddya gabalyache kam nave.”

00:43:44.329 --> 00:43:47.309
It’s not meant for lunatics and lousy people.

00:43:47.309 --> 00:43:51.729
It’s meant for somebody who has tyala pahijet
jatiche.

00:43:51.729 --> 00:43:54.049
You need people of character.

00:43:54.049 --> 00:44:00.970
I know that there cannot be many like that,
but there is no place in God’s realm for

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:04.410
many people, for all these useless people.

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:07.689
It’s only for something special.

00:44:07.689 --> 00:44:12.160
These seats are reserved and you have got
your realization now, somehow.

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:18.210
So now try to understand that this Vishnumaya
Principle has to be expressed and has to be

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:21.929
shown, and you introspect yourself: have I
done that or not?

00:44:21.929 --> 00:44:26.470
Don’t be afraid that they say that “But
our ego will come up.”

00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:27.470
Doesn’t matter.

00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:30.230
You will also see your ego.

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:36.860
This is the second part of Shri Krishna’s
play, that in this Krita Yuga you see your

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:37.860
ego.

00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:44.559
There was a lady who was rather not very kind
to some Maharashtrian ladies.

00:44:44.559 --> 00:44:47.380
So I told her, “You have got right side.”

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:48.380
She wouldn’t believe.

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:54.019
She came to see Me in Rome, and she fell down
on right side, completely.

00:44:54.019 --> 00:44:59.479
Then she realized that her right side was
not all right.

00:44:59.479 --> 00:45:05.509
So to know that, whether you have a right
or a left, there’s a very good method, is

00:45:05.509 --> 00:45:06.509
of meditation.

00:45:06.509 --> 00:45:14.519
Now the third situation is that you must accept
whatever is wrong with you.

00:45:14.519 --> 00:45:19.930
If you do not accept, then you have not been
kind to yourself.

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:26.329
That is the central part of it, that you must
accept, “Yes, this is something wrong with

00:45:26.329 --> 00:45:27.329
me.

00:45:27.329 --> 00:45:33.039
I have gone in this part I’m wrong, of my
Vishuddhi, or that part I’m wrong.

00:45:33.039 --> 00:45:35.539
So now I have to improve.”

00:45:35.539 --> 00:45:40.900
Now, right Vishuddhi people will always try
to correct Me.

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:41.900
I’ve seen it.

00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:44.079
It’s very simple for them.

00:45:44.079 --> 00:45:46.269
If I say anything, “No.”

00:45:46.269 --> 00:45:47.269
First words.

00:45:47.269 --> 00:45:49.079
Different types “no’s” there are.

00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:50.089
Sometimes, “No!”

00:45:50.089 --> 00:46:00.620
Sometimes it is “No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no!”

00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:10.529
They will contradict Me or try to put their
own idea, and then they discover that it was

00:46:10.529 --> 00:46:12.929
wrong; they should not have said it.

00:46:12.929 --> 00:46:18.420
Say for example, if I say, “I saw these
things lying here.”

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:19.749
They said, “No.”

00:46:19.749 --> 00:46:26.620
I said, “I saw with My own eyes and once
I see something, you know, it’s registers,

00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:27.640
it’s there.”

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:28.640
“No.”

00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:30.819
I say, “All right, just try to find out.”

00:46:30.819 --> 00:46:31.819
“It’s there.

00:46:31.819 --> 00:46:34.829
How is it we didn’t see?”

00:46:34.829 --> 00:46:40.319
I said, “Because your ‘no’ was written
on your eyes, I think, you couldn’t see

00:46:40.319 --> 00:46:41.319
anything.”

00:46:41.319 --> 00:46:46.410
And then they’ll pull their ears – that’s
the best.

00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:52.360
But if you see that “This is a habit I have
of saying no to things.”

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:56.549
So first of all, I also test you.

00:46:56.549 --> 00:47:01.289
Supposing I say it is just now nine o’clock
in the night, you just say yes; let’s see

00:47:01.289 --> 00:47:02.520
what happens.

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:04.370
Try to see.

00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:14.470
You see, I test you many a times like this
and then I see that some people – if I say

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:19.269
so, all right, if it’s so, if Mother has
said, it is so.

00:47:19.269 --> 00:47:23.429
And then it starts building up their faith
very well.

00:47:23.429 --> 00:47:35.850
I can see they’re, clearly how they are
coming into the realm of real faith, and there

00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:38.130
when I say something absurd they’ll just
smile.

00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:44.049
They know it is Mother is just testing us,
you see, so they just smile.

00:47:44.049 --> 00:47:47.950
They wouldn’t do anything, but they’ll
just smile.

00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:53.420
And then if it is so and if they don’t know,
they’ll say, “Yes, it must be.

00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:56.880
Mother must have done this or said so.”

00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.549
So your testing time is there.

00:47:59.549 --> 00:48:01.059
You have to test yourself.

00:48:01.059 --> 00:48:06.259
As Mohammed Sahib has said, that your hands
will speak and they’ll give witness against

00:48:06.259 --> 00:48:09.449
you – so on your hands you will know.

00:48:09.449 --> 00:48:14.279
Now these hands are the blessings of Shri
Krishna.

00:48:14.279 --> 00:48:21.429
They come out from the same Vishuddhi, and
as you know the pelvic nerves serves it on

00:48:21.429 --> 00:48:22.429
all that.

00:48:22.429 --> 00:48:29.679
And there are two chakras of one Lalita, another
Shri Chakras, all on these both sides; they

00:48:29.679 --> 00:48:32.430
also play into the hands of Shri Krishna.

00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:37.289
With these hands we can feel the vibrations.

00:48:37.289 --> 00:48:42.559
Now if your right Vishuddhi’s too strong
you may not feel, if your left Vishuddhi’s

00:48:42.559 --> 00:48:49.190
too strong you may not feel, but that doesn’t
mean that you haven’t got realization.

00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:50.190
You have got.

00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:52.499
You just work out your hands.

00:48:52.499 --> 00:48:58.770
Now for working your hands, you have to see
that you don’t use them for useless things.

00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:03.829
That’s very important, because you have
special hands.

00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:10.610
These hands are the ones with which you spread
the collectivity.

00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:21.789
Now for example, Italy example this: here
the people when they talk, they’ll go on

00:49:21.789 --> 00:49:26.160
… They don’t know anything what they are
saying, they only know their own, all their

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.589
gestures, and they only can depict.

00:49:28.589 --> 00:49:34.890
For a person who doesn’t know them, on they’ll
go on like this, like this, all the time.

00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:36.230
So this should be reduced.

00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:40.870
There’s no need to use your hands so much
all the time, like this, like that.

00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:46.329
Little bit, but while using the hands also
it should be decent, it should be regulated,

00:49:46.329 --> 00:49:55.589
it should be
very indicative and useful.

00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:59.579
Just showing off your hands is not good.

00:49:59.579 --> 00:50:04.819
It is some sort of a theory came out, I was
told, that you must put your gestures into

00:50:04.819 --> 00:50:07.259
your hands and speak.

00:50:07.259 --> 00:50:10.180
Is all right for people like Hitler, but not
for us.

00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:12.329
For us we should be decent.

00:50:12.329 --> 00:50:16.059
We should, whenever we have to say – now
for example, you want to point out something

00:50:16.059 --> 00:50:17.660
to someone, shouldn’t say “do this.”

00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:21.309
This is Shri Krishna’s finger, you can’t
use it like that.

00:50:21.309 --> 00:50:27.130
Let them do, means supporting everything.

00:50:27.130 --> 00:50:30.049
This looks better.

00:50:30.049 --> 00:50:32.100
These hands are to be used for collectivity.

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:36.229
See, we say “namaste” when we meet others.

00:50:36.229 --> 00:50:39.100
To thousands of people we can say “namaste.”

00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:43.519
But I don’t like the shaking hands business
because it’s no good.

00:50:43.519 --> 00:50:45.640
Shaking hands doesn’t create any collectivity.

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:49.989
On the contrary, you might get all kinds of
pins and needles and all kinds of problems

00:50:49.989 --> 00:50:51.709
from others.

00:50:51.709 --> 00:51:00.170
But when you talk to people also, with these
hands only you can feel them; with these hands

00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:08.009
only you can care for your children; with
these hands only you can suggest your softness,

00:51:08.009 --> 00:51:15.089
your sweetness, and also with the mouth – which
is of course is a part of the Vishuddhi, that’s

00:51:15.089 --> 00:51:17.900
different – but specially hands.

00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:27.680
Your gestures and everything should show very
heartfelt emotions, and then only these gestures

00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:30.100
have some meaning.

00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:34.160
Now in Sahaja Yoga as you know, you hold each
other’s hands and the vibration starts flowing

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:35.910
among yourselves.

00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:44.710
And you can also hear the tabla on your throbbings,
so that shows that they are the communication.

00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:50.900
So these hands, which are really the beginning
of the collectivity – most important, I

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:59.469
would say the most important things are the
hands, which act for your collectivity.

00:51:59.469 --> 00:52:07.670
As far as you are concerned there are many
other angels and other ganas who are standing

00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:08.719
behind you.

00:52:08.719 --> 00:52:15.650
They also, they extend their help to you whenever
you want to communicate something, they also

00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:17.700
do your jobs very well.

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:27.559
So whatever is expressed in your hand or through
your hand, they immediately pick up.

00:52:27.559 --> 00:52:38.120
As you know that Vishuddhi has sixteen petals,
and all ear, nose, throat, eyes, all are guided

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:39.719
by this.

00:52:39.719 --> 00:52:46.789
Also the sub-plexus of this Vishuddhi is this
one, is the Hamsa Chakra.

00:52:46.789 --> 00:52:53.380
So we have these eyes to see, eyes to communicate.

00:52:53.380 --> 00:53:00.779
The pure eyes communicate pure love, purity.

00:53:00.779 --> 00:53:09.089
With the pure eyes you can cleanse people,
with the pure eyes you can help others, you

00:53:09.089 --> 00:53:11.339
can bring peace.

00:53:11.339 --> 00:53:16.059
The purification of the eyes takes place through
your Vishuddhi and Agnya.

00:53:16.059 --> 00:53:20.779
Here both things have to work out.

00:53:20.779 --> 00:53:24.689
The nose is very important.

00:53:24.689 --> 00:53:34.489
Nose has to be pure, in the sense that you
should be able to discard whatever is smelling

00:53:34.489 --> 00:53:39.210
badly, and you should be able to accept whatever
is fragrant.

00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:47.459
It’s very important, because nose is the
speciality of Shri Krishna, I would say, in

00:53:47.459 --> 00:53:55.150
the sense that He’s the Kubera, and the
Kubera has given the nose to the Goddess.

00:53:55.150 --> 00:54:05.600
Some people have a bad habit of moving their
nose just to show disapproval or something

00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:07.189
like this, they go on doing like that.

00:54:07.189 --> 00:54:14.850
This is very wrong, because then you are insulting
yourself, you’re insulting your Kubera power.

00:54:14.850 --> 00:54:18.049
So you have to keep your nose in a dignified
manner.

00:54:18.049 --> 00:54:20.850
It should be a dignified nose.

00:54:20.850 --> 00:54:27.270
It should not be used for doing something
which is undignified, or which expresses contempt.

00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:31.039
Then your teeth are very important.

00:54:31.039 --> 00:54:39.319
You have thirty-two teeth, see: sixteen of
Krishna’s powers divided into, you can say,

00:54:39.319 --> 00:54:40.319
thirty-two.

00:54:40.319 --> 00:54:46.860
These are your teeth on both the sides.

00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:51.679
The right side is on top and the left down
below.

00:54:51.679 --> 00:54:54.819
That is one thing we neglect very much in
the West, I must say.

00:54:54.819 --> 00:54:55.900
In India it is not.

00:54:55.900 --> 00:55:00.759
It is very much we neglect, and that’s what
we have to look after.

00:55:00.759 --> 00:55:11.100
The reason for neglect is that, I would say,
is laziness, must be the laziness, but at

00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:15.240
least twice or thrice you must brush your
teeth.

00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:22.720
Is important, that I need not say, but more
important is to change the brush.

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:32.719
Also you have to use butter, or salt and oil
to rub your gums.

00:55:32.719 --> 00:55:41.019
If you rub your gums properly, you will never
have problems with your teeth and your gums.

00:55:41.019 --> 00:55:46.809
Moreover, every time in the evening you must
again brush your teeth.

00:55:46.809 --> 00:55:51.190
I’ve seen many people who come to Me in
the evening in the program, such a horrible

00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:53.000
smell from their mouth comes out.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:57.939
It is not that it’s a disease but it is,
only thing is that they have not cleansed

00:55:57.939 --> 00:55:59.539
their teeth.

00:55:59.539 --> 00:56:04.019
Also there are people who will not even brush
their teeth, and start eating breakfast.

00:56:04.019 --> 00:56:08.789
I don’t know, it was another theory started,
I think, that you can eat your food without

00:56:08.789 --> 00:56:09.799
brushing.

00:56:09.799 --> 00:56:14.809
Teeth are very important, and one must look
after them.

00:56:14.809 --> 00:56:24.969
On the teeth it depends all the qualities
of your Vishuddhi.

00:56:24.969 --> 00:56:34.049
So one has to look after the teeth in a proper
way, and should never clench and never show

00:56:34.049 --> 00:56:36.420
temper with the teeth.

00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:37.420
It’s a very bad habit.

00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:40.549
Also here is a gesture I have seen that if
they don’t like something, they just go

00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:41.589
on like this.

00:56:41.589 --> 00:56:44.140
It’s a very wrong thing.

00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:52.900
One should avoid that kind of a gesture, and
it’s very dangerous for your teeth.

00:56:52.900 --> 00:57:01.930
So today’s lecture is more sort of medical,
I must say.

00:57:01.930 --> 00:57:17.589
A person who is spiritually endowed has an
expression which can never be aggressive.

00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:25.739
He may not be good-looking, may not be very,
a sort of a attractive personality, but the

00:57:25.739 --> 00:57:32.120
expression on the face is absolutely saintly.

00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:37.200
That is also the blessings of Shri Krishna.

00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:50.150
I have seen people after one year of realization,
and I was surprised how their faces were changed,

00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:54.269
that I could not recognize them who they were.

00:57:54.269 --> 00:58:02.140
The whole thing becomes absolutely mild, soft,
peaceful and very joyous.

00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:08.769
All the qualities of Shri Krishna can be expressed
on your face.

00:58:08.769 --> 00:58:11.559
You can be sometimes mischievous to look at.

00:58:11.559 --> 00:58:22.100
So many expressions there are which come on
the face, and give you a very sweet feeling.

00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:27.769
But some people have a habit of looking in
the mirror all the time, which is very wrong,

00:58:27.769 --> 00:58:30.959
because it gives you a kind of a funny ego.

00:58:30.959 --> 00:58:36.079
Is better to look at Shri Krishna’s photograph
than to look at your own faces, so that your

00:58:36.079 --> 00:58:40.130
face will become like that of Shri Krishna;
instead of you start looking in the mirror

00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:41.380
all the time.

00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:46.950
What will become of you, God knows, because
maybe if you go to your past, God knows what

00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:48.069
you’ll become.

00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:52.269
So also I’m thankful to psychiatrists that
they don’t like narcissism.

00:58:52.269 --> 00:58:57.419
But it’s very dangerous to all the time
watch your face in the mirror, very dangerous.

00:58:57.419 --> 00:59:02.360
It creates a very funny personality, that
you start telling yourself, “Oh, I’m Napoleon.”

00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:07.809
So you become Napoleon, and start behaving
like Napoleon.

00:59:07.809 --> 00:59:12.910
Next day you find one Napoleon walks out of
the bathroom!

00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:21.420
So one has to be careful not to pay so much
attention and importance to your own self,

00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:24.910
but to your Self which is within, which is
your spirit.

00:59:24.910 --> 00:59:31.620
And if you look after that side, then all
these things will happen in such a beautiful

00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:32.680
manner.

00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:36.189
Also the hair are looked after by Shri Krishna.

00:59:36.189 --> 00:59:42.759
Now you see, you know that He’s very fond
of anything that is like butter, so you have

00:59:42.759 --> 00:59:46.150
to put either butter or oil or something in
your hair.

00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:48.860
If you don’t put it you’ll become bald.

00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:53.400
What can – I mean it is after all a karma
phala.

00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:55.289
If you don’t put oil, you’ll become bald.

00:59:55.289 --> 01:00:01.019
So you have to put oil, and oil was put always
before in the West.

01:00:01.019 --> 01:00:05.499
I see all these old films and all that, they’re
all oiled people.

01:00:05.499 --> 01:00:10.819
But now of course, if you don’t want to
put oil in the daytime you can wash it off,

01:00:10.819 --> 01:00:16.230
but at least once a week you must oil your
head.

01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:21.269
Shri Krishna’s star is Saturn, Shani.

01:00:21.269 --> 01:00:30.920
They say that if He gets after somebody, then
nobody can be saved.

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:34.819
If Shri Krishna gets after someone, then nobody
can be saved.

01:00:34.819 --> 01:00:40.430
In the same way, if Saturn gets after someone
then that person is finished, so we say it’s

01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:44.529
for sometimes, it is seven years He’s after
you, or sometimes two-and-a-half years after

01:00:44.529 --> 01:00:45.529
you.

01:00:45.529 --> 01:00:57.549
So this Saturn of Shri Krishna is a, it’s
a quality within us that, supposing if somebody

01:00:57.549 --> 01:01:02.600
troubles us or does something, we don’t
have to do anything.

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:11.610
Now this Shri Krishna policy, this, we can
say, the Shri Krishna’s nature will work

01:01:11.610 --> 01:01:13.789
it out.

01:01:13.789 --> 01:01:23.299
It will inform this all-pervading Power, and
through that this man or this woman, or this

01:01:23.299 --> 01:01:27.509
party or this organization which is trying
to trouble us will be hounded, while we’ll

01:01:27.509 --> 01:01:28.989
be just sitting doing nothing.

01:01:28.989 --> 01:01:34.489
They’ll be just hounded till they jump in
the sea.

01:01:34.679 --> 01:01:38.429
[missing part] plays around, but
He doesn’t forgive.

01:01:38.554 --> 01:01:40.804
He doesn’t believe in forgiveness.

01:01:40.804 --> 01:01:43.964
He says, “Now, you had enough of it.”

01:01:43.964 --> 01:01:50.604
He gives a big, big long rope to hang yourself,
but He never forgives.

01:01:50.604 --> 01:01:53.564
One thing for definite, He never forgives.

01:01:53.564 --> 01:01:58.044
As you must have seen in Mahabharata His own
judgment of things, you see, He doesn’t

01:01:58.044 --> 01:01:59.044
forgive.

01:01:59.044 --> 01:02:00.044
He says, “You have to pay.

01:02:00.044 --> 01:02:03.094
You have to pay for it.”

01:02:03.094 --> 01:02:08.865
Except when, when you transcend.

01:02:08.865 --> 01:02:22.304
If you become a Sahaja yogi, if you have transcended
Vishuddhi, then He cannot do anything like

01:02:22.304 --> 01:02:23.445
that to you.

01:02:23.445 --> 01:02:30.665
But if you have not, if there’s no ascent
you cannot be saved, you cannot be saved from

01:02:30.665 --> 01:02:31.665
Him.

01:02:31.665 --> 01:02:36.635
They say once Mohammed Gajani came to loot
our country – I mean, it’s a story about

01:02:36.635 --> 01:02:39.744
the village folk.

01:02:39.744 --> 01:02:45.715
And there he’s looted Somnath, a big temple
of ours, which had lots of gold, jewelry,

01:02:45.715 --> 01:02:47.505
everything in it.

01:02:47.505 --> 01:02:52.687
So these brahmins were, you see, taking money
from all these people and looting them, and

01:02:52.687 --> 01:03:00.655
putting them in the temple and using them,
and the rest of the people were very poor.

01:03:00.655 --> 01:03:08.475
So it was sort of a reaction in them, and
the story they tell like this: so this Mohammed

01:03:08.475 --> 01:03:13.455
Gajani looted Somnath, is the temple of Mahadeva.

01:03:13.455 --> 01:03:19.174
Now Mahadeva never needs any ornaments or
anything, but they had put this there.

01:03:19.174 --> 01:03:27.895
So Hanumana saw that Mahadeva got out of the
temple and was running, so Hanumana ran after

01:03:27.895 --> 01:03:28.895
Him.

01:03:28.895 --> 01:03:33.175
Then at one point Mahadeva sat down, and Hanumana
came.

01:03:33.175 --> 01:03:36.145
He said, “You are the God of Gods.

01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:37.554
Why are You running?

01:03:37.554 --> 01:03:39.324
What are You afraid of?”

01:03:39.324 --> 01:03:41.645
He said, “You don’t know this Mohammed
Gajani?”

01:03:41.645 --> 01:03:43.324
He said, “No I don’t know.”

01:03:43.324 --> 01:03:45.004
“All right, hide behind a tree.”

01:03:45.004 --> 01:03:46.405
They hid behind a tree.

01:03:46.405 --> 01:03:50.964
So this Mohammed Gajani came and sat down
– this is the folklore I’m telling, folk

01:03:50.964 --> 01:03:54.954
people tell – sat down under that tree.

01:03:54.954 --> 01:04:00.594
And turning to Shri Krishna, he said, “This
horrible thing, if He gets after someone,

01:04:00.594 --> 01:04:02.844
who can be saved?

01:04:02.844 --> 01:04:07.034
Under my nose these brahmins were making money
and all that, putting it in Somnath temple,

01:04:07.034 --> 01:04:09.104
which was not to be done.

01:04:09.104 --> 01:04:14.975
I couldn’t do anything, so He came, and
with this fellow after me I cannot be saved

01:04:14.975 --> 01:04:18.414
either, so I am running away from the temple.”

01:04:18.414 --> 01:04:25.165
So this is the story given by the villagers,
but which shows that if Shri Krishna is after

01:04:25.165 --> 01:04:29.854
somebody, then nobody can save that person,
he has to run away; because He has so many

01:04:29.854 --> 01:04:34.574
tricks and so many styles that you can’t
get out of it.

01:04:34.574 --> 01:04:39.414
He’ll use His brains in so many manners,
and that He’ll put that person right who

01:04:39.414 --> 01:04:41.844
is trying to trouble you.

01:04:41.844 --> 01:04:49.195
So you must have complete faith in the powers
of Shri Krishna which is within yourself,

01:04:49.195 --> 01:04:51.084
which is being aware now.

01:04:51.084 --> 01:04:57.054
And also if you have ascended fully out of
this, then He will not trouble; but if you

01:04:57.054 --> 01:05:01.905
have left Vishuddhi He will trouble you, definitely.

01:05:01.905 --> 01:05:04.794
If you have left Vishuddhi Shri Krishna will
definitely trouble you, and be careful.

01:05:04.794 --> 01:05:07.604
So get rid of your left Vishuddhis now.

01:05:07.604 --> 01:05:08.824
That’s very important.

01:05:08.824 --> 01:05:14.965
Because then Shri Krishna will take your test
and will make you so miserable that you will

01:05:14.965 --> 01:05:16.064
not know why.

01:05:16.064 --> 01:05:20.834
“Mother, You see, I did this, I did this
puja, I did this till, let’s see now, this

01:05:20.834 --> 01:05:23.044
is the situation in my family.

01:05:23.044 --> 01:05:24.425
This is what happened.”

01:05:24.425 --> 01:05:27.714
“All right, are you a Catholic?”

01:05:27.714 --> 01:05:28.714
“Yes.”

01:05:28.714 --> 01:05:29.974
“Feel guilty?”

01:05:29.974 --> 01:05:30.974
“Yes.”

01:05:30.974 --> 01:05:32.994
“So have it.”

01:05:32.994 --> 01:05:33.994
What can I do?

01:05:33.994 --> 01:05:36.185
Shri Krishna cannot be controlled by anyone.

01:05:36.185 --> 01:05:42.854
He does whatever He thinks proper and He is
meant to really punish much more than the

01:05:42.854 --> 01:05:45.844
Mother, I can tell you.

01:05:45.844 --> 01:05:51.514
They say that She’s Adi Rudra, Adi Saumya:
She’s the one who’s very hard and also

01:05:51.514 --> 01:05:55.794
very, very soft, but up to a point.

01:05:55.794 --> 01:05:57.214
He is not.

01:05:57.214 --> 01:05:58.414
Nothing can convince Him.

01:05:58.414 --> 01:06:05.324
Once you get into His control, that He’ll
see to it that you are put right, left, right,

01:06:05.324 --> 01:06:08.044
any way He’ll make you all right.

01:06:08.044 --> 01:06:13.594
So one thing is there, that you should be
sure that you should have your Vishuddhis

01:06:13.594 --> 01:06:20.704
all right, first of all, and also get Shri
Krishna manifesting on others.

01:06:20.704 --> 01:06:22.365
You don’t have to do anything.

01:06:22.365 --> 01:06:24.477
He’ll look after you, everything, and work
it out.

01:06:24.477 --> 01:06:28.885
But left Vishuddhi is a disease of the West.

01:06:28.885 --> 01:06:33.775
I also feel so much from you all that I sometimes
feel like running away to India, because in

01:06:33.775 --> 01:06:35.804
India nobody feels guilty.

01:06:35.804 --> 01:06:37.915
They don’t believe in feeling guilty.

01:06:37.915 --> 01:06:38.965
“What is there?

01:06:38.965 --> 01:06:40.425
We have not murdered anyone.

01:06:40.425 --> 01:06:42.155
Why should we feel guilty?”

01:06:42.155 --> 01:06:45.145
Here it is a disease with everyone, “I feel
guilty.”

01:06:45.145 --> 01:06:52.564
I don’t know who has introduced this idea,
maybe this Catholic Church, but carried too

01:06:52.564 --> 01:06:53.564
far.

01:06:53.564 --> 01:06:59.954
So then we come to the Virata's point, is
here.

01:06:59.954 --> 01:07:06.234
Before that we have to cross the Hamsa; without
that you cannot reach the Virat point.

01:07:06.234 --> 01:07:13.655
So Hamsa is as you know very well, is the
discretion, divine discretion, which must

01:07:13.655 --> 01:07:16.984
be within you.

01:07:16.984 --> 01:07:21.574
Once you develop that, then you don’t commit
mistakes.

01:07:21.574 --> 01:07:27.244
You never commit mistakes – mistakes in
the sense you don’t do things which are

01:07:27.244 --> 01:07:29.814
again pushed back on you, or for which you
have to pay.

01:07:29.814 --> 01:07:32.905
It’s just a very straightforward life.

01:07:32.905 --> 01:07:34.274
“It’s so?

01:07:34.274 --> 01:07:35.635
It’s so.”

01:07:35.635 --> 01:07:41.455
With this discretion, absolutely you have
a complete understanding as to what has to

01:07:41.455 --> 01:07:44.195
be done and what not to be done.

01:07:44.195 --> 01:07:47.434
And if that is established, a discretion is
established.

01:07:47.434 --> 01:07:52.414
In many Sahaja yogis, I must say, discretion
has come even with their left Vishuddhi.

01:07:52.414 --> 01:07:56.635
Even if they have left Vishuddhi they have
this discretion, they know what is right and

01:07:56.635 --> 01:07:57.635
what is wrong.

01:07:57.635 --> 01:08:04.375
With that divine discretion, the first thing
that happens is that people get impressed

01:08:04.375 --> 01:08:05.375
by you.

01:08:05.375 --> 01:08:07.895
It’s real collectivity, it impresses the
collectivity.

01:08:07.895 --> 01:08:13.004
A person who has divine discretion, people
immediately see the wisdom of that person

01:08:13.004 --> 01:08:15.896
and think, “See now, this man, how could
he be?

01:08:15.896 --> 01:08:17.854
He’s so young, how could he be?

01:08:17.854 --> 01:08:20.934
He’s such a child, how could he be?”

01:08:20.934 --> 01:08:30.184
So this divine discretion which is the, here,
Hamsa Chakra’s speciality, when it starts

01:08:30.184 --> 01:08:38.414
manifesting then automatically you impress,
automatically you impress the collectivity.

01:08:38.414 --> 01:08:42.844
This is a very important point one has to
know.

01:08:42.844 --> 01:08:48.185
While introspecting yourself, you just see
if you have developed this quality of divine

01:08:48.185 --> 01:08:49.264
discretion or not.

01:08:49.264 --> 01:08:53.645
For example, there are many I have seen when
they come to the program, they come and tell

01:08:53.645 --> 01:08:56.895
Me, “Mother, some Sahaja yogi told me that
‘You have a bhoot.’

01:08:56.895 --> 01:08:59.244
Have I got a bhoot in me?”

01:08:59.244 --> 01:09:00.925
I said, “Not at all.

01:09:00.925 --> 01:09:03.625
How can there be any bhoot in you?”

01:09:03.625 --> 01:09:09.744
He may be having, but the divine discretion
is not to tell him just now, but to remove

01:09:09.744 --> 01:09:10.744
it.

01:09:10.744 --> 01:09:21.175
So divine discretion gives you a complete
understanding what is the way to handle another

01:09:21.175 --> 01:09:29.244
personality, what is the way to handle a collective,
how to talk to others, how to impress on them

01:09:29.244 --> 01:09:30.865
the right things.

01:09:30.865 --> 01:09:38.794
It’s a very, very expansive manifestation
in so many directions.

01:09:38.794 --> 01:09:42.254
If you have no divine discretion, you’ll
start speaking what you should not speak,

01:09:42.254 --> 01:09:47.165
you’ll start saying at a time when you should
not say.

01:09:47.165 --> 01:09:51.265
I mean, you’ll have no sense at all of any
direction.

01:09:51.265 --> 01:09:58.244
So to have divine discretion is very important,
for which as you know, Hamsa Chakra physically

01:09:58.244 --> 01:10:03.985
as well mentally and also spiritually must
be kept all right.

01:10:03.985 --> 01:10:10.185
In My Hamsas – we had one puja where I talked
about it.

01:10:10.185 --> 01:10:14.675
The last is the Virat: that is the state you
have to reach.

01:10:14.675 --> 01:10:19.954
Is the Virat is here in front, as you know.

01:10:19.954 --> 01:10:29.424
And I was surprised when I went to Nepal,
which is a temple of Shiva there: despite

01:10:29.424 --> 01:10:34.934
they were worshipping Shiva they were putting
all the kumkum here.

01:10:34.934 --> 01:10:39.764
So I thought that they don’t know why they
are putting, because even if you worship Shiva

01:10:39.764 --> 01:10:42.804
you must also worship here, the Virata.

01:10:42.804 --> 01:10:50.854
They don’t put it here – here; because
they’re absolutely hundred percent only

01:10:50.854 --> 01:10:55.424
Shiva worshippers, so why should they put
it here?

01:10:55.424 --> 01:11:05.584
Because somebody who knows, who was gnostic,
has told them that this is the place of Virat.

01:11:05.584 --> 01:11:23.074
Once you get into Virata, then all your ideas
of separating or differentiating goes away.

01:11:23.074 --> 01:11:32.324
You do not have any more ideas of races left,
of nationality, of your city, of your village

01:11:32.324 --> 01:11:33.604
or anything.

01:11:33.604 --> 01:11:40.324
At that stage you don’t belong to any place.

01:11:40.324 --> 01:11:42.574
You belong to every place, and you don’t
belong to every place.

01:11:42.574 --> 01:11:47.984
Such a situation comes in when you don’t
hanker after any particular food, you don’t

01:11:47.984 --> 01:11:57.914
like any particular type of people, you can
adjust yourself into any circumstances, into

01:11:57.914 --> 01:12:02.554
any families, into any kind of people.

01:12:02.554 --> 01:12:04.174
You can live with drunkards.

01:12:04.174 --> 01:12:11.914
I mean I have lived with drunkards – “lived”
means I have shaken hands at least with so

01:12:11.914 --> 01:12:13.284
many of them.

01:12:13.284 --> 01:12:16.494
You can be with any kind of person.

01:12:16.494 --> 01:12:22.044
Nothing bothers you because you are in the
Virata state; because everything is absorbed

01:12:22.044 --> 01:12:25.314
by the Virat, and you do not feel anything.

01:12:25.314 --> 01:12:28.615
Whatever sort of person may be, you do not
feel it.

01:12:28.615 --> 01:12:34.385
The Virat has to suffer, not you, and that
is what is the best state where I want all

01:12:34.385 --> 01:12:40.274
of you to reach, and to become absolutely
free.

01:12:40.274 --> 01:12:46.395
Nothing can impress you, nothing can influence
you, nothing can dissuade you, but you stand

01:12:46.395 --> 01:12:51.914
on your self-esteem and understanding about
yourself, that you’re a Sahaja yogi and

01:12:51.914 --> 01:13:01.944
that you are connected with this power, and
you are a citizen of Kingdom of God.

01:13:01.944 --> 01:13:13.064
At the Virata state there's no doubt left
about it, no doubt, because you become part

01:13:13.064 --> 01:13:17.984
and parcel of the whole, absolutely, and you
can affect anywhere.

01:13:17.984 --> 01:13:20.244
If this finger is hurt, then this finger can
feel it.

01:13:20.244 --> 01:13:29.145
In the same way such a person is felt everywhere,
and not only that, but that person can be

01:13:29.145 --> 01:13:31.064
effective everywhere.

01:13:31.064 --> 01:13:38.224
For that state of reaching to Virat, one should
try to slowly, gradually, “Ya neti neti

01:13:38.224 --> 01:13:40.494
vachanaih nirgama avochu” say.

01:13:40.494 --> 01:13:42.804
You have to go on saying, “This is not my
sister.

01:13:42.804 --> 01:13:44.224
This is not my brother.

01:13:44.224 --> 01:13:46.164
They are all my brothers.

01:13:46.164 --> 01:13:47.734
They’re all my sisters.

01:13:47.734 --> 01:13:51.895
I love them the same as my sisters and my
brothers.

01:13:51.895 --> 01:13:53.484
This is not my family.

01:13:53.484 --> 01:13:56.454
The whole Sahaja Yoga is my family.”

01:13:56.454 --> 01:14:00.194
The whole attention should move like that.

01:14:00.194 --> 01:14:04.744
“This is not only mine, it is everybody’s.

01:14:04.744 --> 01:14:07.304
It belongs to everyone.

01:14:07.304 --> 01:14:09.494
Everybody has a right.”

01:14:09.494 --> 01:14:14.544
That sort of a thing, when it starts growing
from individual, what we call is the “vestiti

01:14:14.544 --> 01:14:21.824
tu sumestiti” in Sanskrit, they say “vestiti
tu sumestiti,” from individual to collective.

01:14:21.824 --> 01:14:28.084
And such a personality then is the most effective
one for any kind of collective work.

01:14:28.084 --> 01:14:32.254
I think for today it’s quite sufficient
for you to know about Vishuddhi Chakra.

01:14:32.254 --> 01:14:38.294
I mean, I have talked about it thousands and
thousands of times, and now this is one of

01:14:38.294 --> 01:14:43.385
the sides which I wanted to say, because I
find that still there are people who do not

01:14:43.385 --> 01:14:46.844
understand that they have to rise above Vishuddhi.

01:14:46.844 --> 01:14:53.475
Otherwise, if they do not ascend over Vishuddhi
they can never be proper Sahaja yogis, they’ll

01:14:53.475 --> 01:14:55.284
be always half-baked.

01:14:55.284 --> 01:15:02.794
So we must try to rise above the Vishuddhi,
the discretion part.

01:15:02.794 --> 01:15:09.244
Then at that point we can never doubt Sahaja
Yoga, can never doubt, and that’s how the

01:15:09.244 --> 01:15:11.854
doubtless awareness can come to us.

01:15:11.884 --> 01:15:13.994
May God bless you.

01:15:26.644 --> 01:15:27.644
All right.

01:15:28.528 --> 01:15:32.838
Shri Krishna Puja is very small that way,
not such a long thing.
