01:21.761 --> 01:25.537
﻿I bow to all the seekers of truth.

01:34.419 --> 01:39.817
It was such a great joy for me,

01:40.017 --> 01:44.092
to come to Venice to meet you again.

01:50.363 --> 01:55.307
And I know there are many seekers in this place

01:58.987 --> 02:02.127
and they are trying to seek the truth.

02:06.942 --> 02:09.637
Without finding the truth

02:11.830 --> 02:15.178
and without becoming that,

02:15.379 --> 02:18.762
we cannot talk of peace.

02:24.279 --> 02:27.665
The peace resides within us,

02:30.322 --> 02:34.937
and the human beings who talk of peace themselves are not peaceful

02:40.743 --> 02:43.177
and how can they bring peace,

02:45.777 --> 02:49.525
when they are not in that state themselves?

02:54.244 --> 02:57.041
To find the truth

02:58.175 --> 03:01.766
we feel we have to put in some efforts,

03:08.618 --> 03:12.925
because you are seekers and

03:13.737 --> 03:18.317
you are frantically trying to find the truth

03:23.827 --> 03:27.139
you go to all kinds of extremes.

03:31.056 --> 03:33.817
You’ve been to drugs,

03:34.108 --> 03:36.999
you’ve been to fake gurus,

03:37.200 --> 03:42.257
you have done that whatever a human being can do.

03:49.396 --> 03:52.327
But I have come to tell you,

03:52.527 --> 03:56.137
you don’t have to do anything of that kind.

04:02.040 --> 04:05.577
As you have become a human being

04:05.823 --> 04:08.351
from the amoeba stage,

04:08.552 --> 04:11.897
spontaneously, in the same way,

04:12.097 --> 04:15.777
you become the Spirit spontaneously.

04:27.705 --> 04:32.817
It is nothing artificial that can work it out,

04:33.425 --> 04:39.217
or human endeavour that can bring forth the result.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.697
The one who has created us,

04:53.278 --> 04:58.762
has already made all the arrangements for our ascent.

05:07.521 --> 05:10.611
With all His love and attention,

05:10.811 --> 05:16.297
He has very delicately made all these beautiful chakras within us.

05:25.224 --> 05:27.751
At human awareness,

05:28.001 --> 05:31.217
we do not know what lies within us,

05:37.470 --> 05:42.057
we do not know what organs there are in our being.

05:48.114 --> 05:52.857
Unless and until there is pain, we do not know that they exist.

05:58.386 --> 06:02.737
In the same way, we are not aware of these centres within us,

06:09.421 --> 06:13.576
nor can we feel the pain of the centres within us,

06:18.662 --> 06:21.836
because they are subtle

06:22.036 --> 06:25.017
and we have to become subtler.

06:30.030 --> 06:33.817
But by mental projection we cannot become subtler,

06:38.511 --> 06:42.508
by projecting outside we cannot become subtler.

06:46.782 --> 06:50.624
It’s the projection inside which will work it out.

06:56.435 --> 07:00.275
Now, you all are paying attention to me, but if I say,

07:00.475 --> 07:05.616
but pay attention to yourself inside, you cannot do it.

07:14.981 --> 07:18.000
This happening of the awakening,

07:18.200 --> 07:20.977
of the Kundalini has to take place.

07:27.774 --> 07:33.678
Now, this Kundalini is actually a name given to the power,

07:33.978 --> 07:39.257
which is going to give us our Self-Realisation.

07:48.191 --> 07:51.180
This is everybody’s individual mother,

07:51.381 --> 07:56.177
because it is she that gives you your second birth.

08:05.110 --> 08:08.377
She knows everything about you

08:10.187 --> 08:14.744
and she’s anxiously waiting to sprout out

08:15.278 --> 08:19.097
and emerge out of the last,

08:19.298 --> 08:21.967
chakra called as Sahasrara.

08:32.141 --> 08:36.177
This happening is real baptism, real,

08:39.674 --> 08:42.077
it is not artificial.

08:43.865 --> 08:48.371
You cannot baptise someone by just putting your hand on that person.

08:53.727 --> 08:57.017
The authority has to come from the Divine,

08:57.217 --> 09:00.057
for a person to baptise.

09:06.249 --> 09:09.817
Such a person is the one who is

09:10.017 --> 09:12.737
already united with the Divine.

09:18.256 --> 09:20.697
Now this Divine power,

09:20.897 --> 09:24.057
the power of love of God,

09:24.257 --> 09:27.448
is all-pervading and everywhere.

09:34.322 --> 09:39.897
It is described in all the great scriptures and by the great saints,

09:45.307 --> 09:48.104
but we cannot feel it.

09:50.608 --> 09:55.377
We see these flowers appearing spontaneously on a tree,

09:55.577 --> 09:59.607
becoming fruits; who does that work?

10:06.604 --> 10:08.977
Who pumps our heart?

10:12.637 --> 10:15.249
Who runs our digestion?

10:18.269 --> 10:23.297
The doctors call it “auto”: who is this “auto”?

10:27.934 --> 10:32.718
If you call a car as “automobile”,

10:32.919 --> 10:38.058
then who is the “auto” in the “automobile”?

10:42.262 --> 10:44.590
Who is the driver?

10:48.653 --> 10:51.497
The driver is the Spirit,

10:55.111 --> 10:59.242
which watches and witnesses whatever we are doing.

11:02.838 --> 11:07.897
And Kundalini is the one which rises

11:08.097 --> 11:12.697
through the six chakras, pierces through the last one here

11:12.897 --> 11:16.817
and then connects you to your Spirit,

11:17.017 --> 11:19.537
to your “auto”.

11:32.071 --> 11:36.252
She is the power of pure desire.

11:38.984 --> 11:41.984
Now, what is our pure desire?

11:43.701 --> 11:47.977
Some people want to have a nice house,

11:48.326 --> 11:51.022
then they want to have a nice car,

11:51.222 --> 11:55.901
then they want to have a helicopter, it goes on and on and on.

12:02.930 --> 12:07.377
In general, our desires are not satiable,

12:13.496 --> 12:18.848
so the desires so-called we have, are not the pure desires.

12:23.601 --> 12:28.582
Unless and until when our desire is fulfilled

12:28.782 --> 12:32.897
and we do not want anything more, that is the pure desire.

12:42.343 --> 12:46.228
Now, this pure desire is the Kundalini

12:46.428 --> 12:51.247
and the desire is only one: to know the Truth,

12:51.524 --> 12:55.417
by the union with the Divine.

13:06.155 --> 13:10.200
In the heart is reflected the God Almighty

13:10.401 --> 13:14.876
and Kundalini is the reflection,

13:15.077 --> 13:19.482
of the Holy Ghost, the power of God,

13:28.965 --> 13:32.857
that is the Primordial Mother reflected within us.

13:35.771 --> 13:40.057
It’s a funny concept, to have a Father God

13:40.257 --> 13:44.577
and a Son God and not a Mother God.

13:51.398 --> 13:54.778
How can you have a son without a mother?

13:57.974 --> 14:00.217
Mother is so important.

14:02.344 --> 14:06.582
So when we say that there is a Holy Ghost,

14:06.782 --> 14:09.488
the third thing, that is the Mother,

14:15.875 --> 14:20.857
that is the Primordial Mother which is reflected within us as Kundalini

14:21.057 --> 14:24.939
and She is the one gives us our Self-Realisation.

14:32.198 --> 14:34.411
Now, when we are seeking the Truth,

14:34.611 --> 14:38.357
we go with some concepts in our mind,

14:45.834 --> 14:50.852
some concepts which have come to us from generations to generations,

14:55.629 --> 15:01.132
and some concepts are such that we ourselves have envisaged,

15:01.735 --> 15:04.236
we ourselves have visualised.

15:13.222 --> 15:16.617
But concepts are all artificial.

15:19.966 --> 15:22.355
Supposing sitting down in India,

15:22.555 --> 15:27.268
I start conceiving “I am in Venice” – will I be there?

15:33.884 --> 15:36.456
It cannot be reality.

15:37.997 --> 15:40.817
It has to be a reality.

15:43.574 --> 15:47.297
So the truth has to be known in reality.

15:52.386 --> 15:56.410
And how do we human beings know the reality,

15:56.611 --> 16:00.962
is through our central nervous system, through our nerves,

16:08.853 --> 16:11.699
not through our brains.

16:15.387 --> 16:20.680
Now, supposing somebody says this is
marble and somebody says this is no marble.

16:25.125 --> 16:27.670
Looking at it, I can say it is marble

16:27.870 --> 16:31.101
because I come from a country of marble myself.

16:36.889 --> 16:39.757
But ordinarily, you just place your hands and see:

16:39.957 --> 16:43.950
if it is marble it will be cold, if it is plastic it won’t be cold.

16:52.769 --> 16:56.977
So you can feel it on your central nervous system.

17:03.207 --> 17:08.283
So when you get your Realisation, when you get your Kundalini,

17:08.483 --> 17:11.937
pierce through your fontanel bone area,

17:12.137 --> 17:16.497
then you do feel the cool breeze on your nervous system,

17:31.099 --> 17:34.208
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost,

17:37.505 --> 17:41.057
as we say, the cool breeze of the Adi Shakti.

17:45.195 --> 17:47.861
Now, the saints who talked about it

17:48.062 --> 17:50.897
were not dishonest people.

17:57.984 --> 18:00.984
Same about the incarnations.

18:05.125 --> 18:08.726
But when you moulded these great saints

18:08.926 --> 18:13.694
and incarnations into concepts, they became dead

18:13.894 --> 18:18.392
and that’s how you find somebody’s talking about truth in the church,

18:18.592 --> 18:23.897
another in the temple and another in the mosque.

18:43.198 --> 18:47.177
Now, Truth cannot be many, it has to be One.

18:54.369 --> 18:56.817
Now, in modern times,

18:57.857 --> 19:02.376
thanks to Sahaja Yoga, it has evolved to such an extent,

19:02.577 --> 19:06.232
that you can feel on your fingertips,

19:06.474 --> 19:09.537
those different chakras.

19:18.125 --> 19:23.337
There are many things which cannot
be explained in the Bible, in the Koran,

19:23.537 --> 19:26.417
or in many of the Indian books.

19:32.081 --> 19:36.736
Unless and until you are a realised soul, you cannot understand them.

19:43.188 --> 19:46.980
Mohammed Sahib has said that at the time of resurrection,

19:47.180 --> 19:49.697
your hands will speak.

19:56.602 --> 20:02.172
He has talked of resurrection much more than the doomsday,

20:13.981 --> 20:18.735
but the people who are in charge of the religion

20:18.935 --> 20:20.936
want to talk of the resurrection,

20:21.137 --> 20:25.516
they want to talk of the doomsday
because then they can frighten people

20:25.716 --> 20:28.137
and make some money out of it.

20:40.234 --> 20:43.672
But logically we can see that how,

20:43.872 --> 20:47.217
the God Almighty, who is Love has created us,

20:47.417 --> 20:52.297
would first give us doomsday and never the resurrection?

21:06.233 --> 21:09.897
So the concept about things must be given up

21:10.097 --> 21:14.417
and must be prepared like a scientist with an open mind,

21:14.617 --> 21:16.697
to see the reality.

21:31.485 --> 21:34.324
You may read any number of books,

21:34.524 --> 21:38.249
you may know all the scriptures by heart,

21:38.450 --> 21:41.241
but unless and until you are a realised soul,

21:41.441 --> 21:45.009
you cannot catch the essence of it.

21:54.690 --> 22:00.255
If you talk about the flower and if you talk about the honey,

22:00.712 --> 22:05.082
one about the form, another about the formless,

22:05.283 --> 22:08.657
you are just talking, talking, talking.

22:18.212 --> 22:22.817
You have to become the bee to taste the honey.

22:28.356 --> 22:32.977
It’s all built-in within you, it’s within you, it is there.

22:38.188 --> 22:41.408
Like a seed has all the maps,

22:41.609 --> 22:44.737
of all its trees that are going to come out of it,

22:44.937 --> 22:48.857
in a microscopic way, you too have the same thing,

22:49.057 --> 22:51.935
which has to just sprout you.

23:04.209 --> 23:09.297
But we live within two boundaries of concepts, with ego

23:09.497 --> 23:14.097
and with our conditionings that we have.

23:23.757 --> 23:26.669
It’s like an egg which is formed.

23:29.858 --> 23:35.297
And for resurrection, that egg has to become, the bird.

23:42.386 --> 23:47.177
Today the time is such that many are just ready to get it.

23:57.859 --> 24:01.017
This is what is the second birth,

24:06.606 --> 24:10.216
and it works out very easily.

24:14.091 --> 24:17.576
You don’t have to do anything about it.

24:20.014 --> 24:22.497
How can you pay for it?

24:25.435 --> 24:30.057
How much do we pay to the Mother Earth for sprouting a seed?

24:34.179 --> 24:37.775
You cannot pay for God’s love, can you?

24:37.976 --> 24:40.425
He doesn’t understand money.

24:45.188 --> 24:49.264
What you have to just do is to get your Realisation,

24:49.465 --> 24:52.552
which is “sahaja”, which is spontaneous, Sahaja,

24:52.753 --> 24:55.373
born with you. It’s spontaneous.

25:05.581 --> 25:07.784
It’s the Yoga which is,

25:07.985 --> 25:13.449
meaning is the union with the Divine – it’s your right to have it.

25:20.514 --> 25:23.177
There is no other way you can have it.

25:25.288 --> 25:29.248
Many people feel that if you do physical exercises

25:29.448 --> 25:32.537
or something like that it is yoga: it’s a misnomer.

25:40.887 --> 25:44.176
If you read Patanjali, it’s such a big book,

25:44.377 --> 25:48.195
out of which only a wee bit is one part of the Ashtanga,

25:48.395 --> 25:54.139
is Yama Niyama, out which a wee bit is the exercises.

26:07.664 --> 26:11.438
Rest of it is all Samadhi yoga.

26:14.297 --> 26:17.734
So the first stage you achieve is thoughtless awareness,

26:17.935 --> 26:23.555
called as Nirvichara samadhi, when
you are aware but beyond the thought.

26:34.105 --> 26:38.531
And when you establish it, then you go to the second stage

26:38.731 --> 26:42.363
called as Nirvikalpa Samadhi, meaning the doubtless awareness.

26:42.563 --> 26:45.137
Then your hands work miracles.

26:57.617 --> 27:03.017
At that stage, you are absolutely in
peace with yourself and with others,

27:08.749 --> 27:11.057
but you emit peace,

27:13.512 --> 27:15.897
you emit auspiciousness.

27:22.628 --> 27:26.497
Even a glance of such an innocent personality

27:26.697 --> 27:29.177
can resurrect another personality.

27:38.446 --> 27:41.897
And in modern times it’s not difficult to achieve,

27:46.666 --> 27:51.576
but many people do not want to believe that it is spontaneous,

27:51.776 --> 27:55.217
that you don’t have to do anything about it,

28:01.690 --> 28:07.283
It's as simple as one enlightened candle can enlighten another candle.

28:13.622 --> 28:19.169
Only you have to work it out when
you have to maintain the candle burning.

28:25.255 --> 28:29.200
That also you can learn in a month’s time at the most,

28:33.391 --> 28:36.065
and you can master it so well,

28:36.266 --> 28:38.953
that you yourself

28:39.154 --> 28:42.457
can do miracles on physical,

28:42.657 --> 28:45.600
mental, emotional and spiritual levels.

28:56.580 --> 29:00.312
You can comfort people by your touch

29:00.520 --> 29:03.462
in their sickness, illness,

29:04.870 --> 29:10.401
you can counsel them like great, knowledgeable saints.

29:22.209 --> 29:27.777
We had so many great saints in the
whole world, they never went to any university,

29:33.466 --> 29:35.897
but what knowledge!

29:38.760 --> 29:41.857
So you get complete knowledge,

29:42.057 --> 29:46.897
which is the knowledge of reality, pouring out of you.

29:57.213 --> 29:59.537
You become dynamic

30:01.486 --> 30:07.195
and all your problems are looked after by these great angels.

30:09.338 --> 30:13.217
All your problems are looked after by these great angels.

30:23.167 --> 30:26.296
But in this country, or in the West,

30:26.496 --> 30:29.419
people are naïve about it.

30:36.451 --> 30:40.737
Their knowledge is that of the tree, but not of the roots.

30:46.371 --> 30:49.707
I think the saints know more about Christ,

30:49.907 --> 30:53.337
much more about Christ than who talk about Christ.

31:09.176 --> 31:11.737
So you become the knowledge,

31:14.272 --> 31:17.337
you become the joy and peace,

31:19.546 --> 31:22.457
but you become the redeemer of others.

31:24.891 --> 31:29.169
You redeem others and evolve them.

31:32.392 --> 31:36.051
As in the evolutionary process one fish came out,

31:36.252 --> 31:40.177
and few came out, and then shoals of them came out,

31:40.377 --> 31:42.399
in the same way, in Sahaja Yoga today,

31:42.599 --> 31:46.114
thousands and thousands people are getting Realisation.

32:00.056 --> 32:04.657
So only thing I have to request you just to receive

32:05.662 --> 32:07.681
your awakening

32:08.837 --> 32:11.890
and establish yourself.

32:21.057 --> 32:24.375
I must say I’m very thankful to the Giunta

32:24.575 --> 32:27.857
which has given this hall free to us,

32:28.057 --> 32:31.535
because the last time we didn’t have any proper hall,

32:31.735 --> 32:36.122
and I didn’t know what happened, I just could not relate myself to,

32:36.322 --> 32:39.509
the crowds that were there properly.

32:53.790 --> 32:57.457
Now there is no need to ask about other people,

32:57.657 --> 33:01.991
other gurus and this and that, it’s all useless just now.

33:09.938 --> 33:12.451
You first become your own master.

33:15.051 --> 33:17.687
I’m not a guru, I’m a Mother

33:19.812 --> 33:23.457
and I have come here to give what you have.

33:26.914 --> 33:29.137
This is all your own.

33:31.079 --> 33:34.137
Maybe I have to just hand over the keys to you,

33:37.912 --> 33:40.421
so that you become your own gurus

33:43.082 --> 33:46.063
and gurus of billions,

33:49.572 --> 33:52.857
but real gurus, Sat Gurus.

33:56.563 --> 33:58.563
May God bless you all.

33:59.969 --> 34:02.057
Thank you very much.

34:53.661 --> 34:56.617
I wish we had more time,

34:56.978 --> 35:01.417
but today is the only day we have together

35:01.710 --> 35:07.177
and in this short time whatever was possible I’ve said to you.

35:18.454 --> 35:21.227
Now, you must be having,

35:21.427 --> 35:24.458
some of you, some problems,

35:24.659 --> 35:29.177
and some questions, I appreciate that.

35:35.563 --> 35:41.016
Now if you have any such problems
or questions, you can write them down

35:41.217 --> 35:45.175
and hand them over to Jeremy here,

35:45.376 --> 35:47.697
which will send it over to me.

35:47.897 --> 35:53.470
And I’ll try to see if I can answer them or satisfy you.

36:07.494 --> 36:12.937
But please, do not – just now I do not want to waste time in that.

36:17.668 --> 36:21.217
Let us have our Realisation because

36:21.417 --> 36:26.547
after the experience it’s better, to understand.

36:34.362 --> 36:39.086
If our eyes are not open we cannot see anything,

36:39.287 --> 36:42.217
and then what’s the use of argument?

36:48.868 --> 36:52.235
Better to open our eyes,

36:54.219 --> 36:56.657
and then see for ourselves.

36:58.894 --> 37:02.977
It will take about fifteen minutes at the most.

37:06.257 --> 37:10.697
I would request you that please do not leave,

37:10.897 --> 37:14.257
before it is over, to disturb others,

37:14.769 --> 37:17.993
but if you have to leave, you can leave before that.

37:18.194 --> 37:23.577
It’s going to be extremely simple and easy for you.

37:35.357 --> 37:37.773
There have been some funny books,

37:37.973 --> 37:41.146
which say that Kundalini awakening is dangerous

37:41.347 --> 37:44.297
and I can’t understand that.

37:55.260 --> 37:58.070
When you were born, your mother took,

37:58.270 --> 38:02.076
all the responsibility and the pain upon herself.

38:09.056 --> 38:13.416
In the same way, the Kundalini, who is your Mother

38:13.689 --> 38:16.937
from such a long time,

38:17.137 --> 38:20.489
is not going to give you any trouble whatsoever.

38:28.621 --> 38:32.663
But you have to know that you must respect your Realisation.

38:32.863 --> 38:35.537
I don’t want that – please, water.

38:41.308 --> 38:43.566
You must respect your Self.

38:46.006 --> 38:49.502
There is no time left now to waste,

38:52.724 --> 38:56.997
you have to enter into the Kingdom of God to enjoy life.

39:01.862 --> 39:04.014
May God Bless you all.

39:10.682 --> 39:15.854
We have to take out our shoes
because this Mother Earth helps us a lot.

39:16.054 --> 39:18.897
So just take out your shoes, not your socks.

39:39.366 --> 39:42.096
Sit very comfortably without any asana.

39:42.297 --> 39:44.777
Sit comfortably in a Sahaj asana,

39:44.977 --> 39:48.137
Sahaj Asana is a spread out legs, spread out legs.

39:48.337 --> 39:52.297
Not any tightening, nothing, just spread out.

39:52.681 --> 39:54.681
Stand up.

39:57.966 --> 40:02.577
Sahaj asana, not to tighten.

40:02.777 --> 40:07.446
Sahaj asana: Sahaj asana is spread out. Spread out.

40:08.586 --> 40:12.750
No restriction of the feet at all. Sahaj asana.

40:14.485 --> 40:18.017
Ya. Be comfortable.

40:18.907 --> 40:22.137
You come forward, the people who are there can come forward?

40:22.337 --> 40:24.537
Yes, please, come.

40:25.067 --> 40:26.857
Come along.

40:27.631 --> 40:29.308
Good idea.

40:29.509 --> 40:33.217
It’s all right, the baby will also sit down, nicely.

40:33.594 --> 40:35.897
Yes, sit down, sit down.

40:37.206 --> 40:40.657
It’s all right, for her it doesn’t matter shoes or anything.

40:41.284 --> 40:43.001
She is all right.

40:43.454 --> 40:45.537
She wants to take out, see?

40:48.873 --> 40:51.445
Children understand it better.

40:51.645 --> 40:53.937
They are not complicated.

41:03.149 --> 41:07.537
Now, as he has told you about the chakras,

41:08.566 --> 41:12.252
I am going to tell you how

41:12.452 --> 41:15.337
to awaken your own Kundalini.

41:26.196 --> 41:29.537
Of course, there is no effort in it,

41:32.894 --> 41:36.660
but as we have to

41:37.398 --> 41:41.497
open different centres with our own will,

41:47.421 --> 41:50.738
we’ll have to just put our hands

41:50.938 --> 41:53.957
on the different centres, that’s all.

41:57.756 --> 42:02.737
On the left-hand we’ll work the whole thing, on the left side.

42:07.764 --> 42:12.136
As you will learn about Sahaja
Yoga, you will know that the left hand,

42:12.337 --> 42:15.645
the left hand represents

42:16.280 --> 42:21.776
the desire, the power of desire, not
the pure desire, but the desire power,

42:21.977 --> 42:25.703
and the right hand represents

42:26.056 --> 42:29.104
the power of action.

42:47.068 --> 42:50.577
So we put our left hand like this

42:51.055 --> 42:53.537
on the lap, comfortably,

43:00.379 --> 43:02.916
and also you can,

43:03.116 --> 43:07.617
if there is any pressure on your neck or on your waist.

43:07.817 --> 43:12.213
Or if you are wearing spectacles also
you can take it out later on when I tell you.

43:26.668 --> 43:30.247
Later on you will have to close your eyes completely,

43:30.447 --> 43:35.137
because the attention has to be sucked in by the Kundalini.

43:43.377 --> 43:47.617
Like my sari, you see: now, when the Kundalini rises,

43:47.817 --> 43:50.657
the attention gets sucked in inside.

43:50.857 --> 43:54.137
It’s spread out: it gets sucked in.

44:03.530 --> 44:09.272
So you have to keep your eyes shut all the
time, there’s no mesmerism here to keep eyes open.

44:17.082 --> 44:20.936
But before that I will tell you about the chakras.

44:24.496 --> 44:29.137
First of all, you’ll have to put your right hand on your heart.

44:32.125 --> 44:33.638
Heart.

44:33.839 --> 44:37.080
Now, here resides your Spirit.

44:38.763 --> 44:43.697
Then you have to put your hand on the upper part of the abdomen,

44:44.216 --> 44:46.457
on the left-hand side.

44:52.011 --> 44:56.142
Then you have to put your hand in the lower part,

44:56.342 --> 45:01.497
of your abdomen, pressing it hard, on the left-hand side again.

45:07.150 --> 45:10.617
Now you have to put it back again,

45:10.817 --> 45:13.443
on the upper part of your abdomen,

45:17.671 --> 45:19.737
then on your heart.

45:21.379 --> 45:26.871
Then in between your left arm,

45:27.071 --> 45:31.177
and your neck or the shoulder, like this,

45:31.377 --> 45:34.629
and turn your head to your right.

45:44.804 --> 45:48.537
Then put your hand on your forehead like this,

45:48.737 --> 45:51.137
pressing on both the sides.

45:57.476 --> 46:01.703
Then, on the back, you have to put your head,

46:01.903 --> 46:06.216
resting on your hand like this, just for a short time.

46:13.163 --> 46:15.577
Then you have to stretch your hand

46:15.777 --> 46:19.417
and put your palm, the centre of your palm,

46:19.617 --> 46:23.127
on top of the fontanel bone area,

46:23.327 --> 46:25.457
stretching your fingers tight.

46:25.657 --> 46:28.777
You have to move your scalp,

46:28.977 --> 46:31.631
in such a way, slowly and slowly.

46:31.831 --> 46:35.697
This hand, like that, spread it, the centre of it here,

46:35.897 --> 46:40.929
and try to move your scalp slowly, slowly, seven times.

46:57.611 --> 47:01.857
That’s all, it’s very simple.

47:02.482 --> 47:06.715
So, now, all of you should just remember one thing,

47:06.915 --> 47:11.217
that we are all going to enter into the Kingdom of God.

47:17.434 --> 47:22.062
And this is what we have been working out for ages

47:22.262 --> 47:25.971
and the time has come this moment to do that.

47:36.022 --> 47:39.576
We should have no guilt about ourselves,

47:42.667 --> 47:45.977
we have done nothing wrong whatsoever.

47:52.467 --> 47:57.737
On the contrary, we should be very pleasantly placed towards us.

48:03.002 --> 48:07.657
Not to be frivolous, but not to be serious either

48:15.729 --> 48:18.040
– in a very joyous mood.

48:21.537 --> 48:24.736
Now, please put the left hand towards me

48:25.192 --> 48:27.897
and please close your eyes.

48:36.836 --> 48:38.937
Close your eyes please,

48:39.137 --> 48:42.175
and put the right hand on your heart.

48:46.902 --> 48:49.257
Now keep your eyes shut

48:51.257 --> 48:53.977
and do not open till I tell you.

48:57.907 --> 49:02.743
Now, at this point you have to ask me a very,

49:02.943 --> 49:05.128
fundamental question.

49:05.329 --> 49:09.559
You can call me Mother or you can call me Shri Mataji,

49:09.759 --> 49:11.777
whatever is convenient.

49:11.977 --> 49:15.852
Say, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

49:16.052 --> 49:18.897
Ask this fundamental question three times.

49:36.569 --> 49:38.417
Three times, please.

49:46.246 --> 49:48.250
Now the second question comes in.

49:48.450 --> 49:51.737
If you are the Spirit you are your master too,

49:51.937 --> 49:54.617
so now put the right hand on,

49:54.985 --> 49:59.097
the upper part of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

50:16.764 --> 50:19.577
Left hand towards me, on the lap.

50:22.485 --> 50:26.097
Now here you ask me again a question three times:

50:26.297 --> 50:30.137
“Mother, am I my own master?

50:31.070 --> 50:33.897
Mother, am I my own guru?

50:34.097 --> 50:37.097
Mother, am I my own guide?”

50:59.221 --> 51:00.814
Now,

51:04.888 --> 51:08.337
please, put this right hand,

51:08.537 --> 51:11.657
in the lower part of your abdomen

51:13.706 --> 51:17.291
on the left-hand side and press it hard.

51:21.070 --> 51:23.777
Here you ask,

51:26.401 --> 51:29.897
for the knowledge,

51:30.563 --> 51:34.697
because I cannot force you,

51:35.989 --> 51:37.989
it is,

51:39.321 --> 51:42.297
your freedom which I respect,

51:42.977 --> 51:45.337
so you have to ask:

51:45.537 --> 51:48.737
“Mother, give me the true knowledge,

51:48.937 --> 51:51.177
of Divine laws,

51:51.413 --> 51:54.697
Mother, give me the pure knowledge.”

51:56.562 --> 52:01.329
This you have to say six times: “Mother, give me the pure knowledge”.

52:01.529 --> 52:05.297
You have to say, I cannot force on you.

52:33.908 --> 52:35.620
Six times.

52:45.122 --> 52:47.457
Goes up in the Swadishthana, you see.

52:50.029 --> 52:55.196
When you say that, now the Kundalini has started moving.

52:55.397 --> 52:59.897
But you do not feel guilty or diffident at all.

53:10.264 --> 53:12.264
With confidence,

53:12.968 --> 53:15.549
you now put your right hand,

53:15.757 --> 53:20.377
in the upper part of your abdomen on the left-hand side, please.

53:30.698 --> 53:33.617
Now here, with full confidence,

53:33.817 --> 53:36.621
to open this centre of this,

53:37.116 --> 53:42.614
Master principle or Guru principle you have to say,

53:42.977 --> 53:47.697
with full confidence, ten times:

53:47.897 --> 53:51.728
“Mother, I am my own master.”

54:00.716 --> 54:02.337
Right Swadishthana.

54:18.190 --> 54:19.621
Good. Good.

54:20.330 --> 54:22.497
Better? Warren: … Better.

54:36.006 --> 54:37.367
Shri Mataji: Better, too.

54:42.795 --> 54:46.657
Now, please, raise,

54:47.151 --> 54:51.384
your right hand again onto your heart.

54:51.613 --> 54:54.258
It seems like this Swadishthana is better.

55:09.681 --> 55:14.896
Here you have to say, again with full confidence,

55:15.104 --> 55:18.457
the greatest truth about yourself:

55:19.604 --> 55:23.841
“Mother, I am the Spirit”.

55:24.041 --> 55:29.217
Say it twelve times, because there
are twelve petals to the heart centre.

55:29.687 --> 55:33.497
“Mother, I am the Spirit”.

55:53.464 --> 55:54.937
Better.

56:20.138 --> 56:23.417
Now. Twelve times, please.

56:36.341 --> 56:38.562
The doors must be open here.

56:38.762 --> 56:43.257
Ah, done. Good. Yes.

56:48.374 --> 56:53.311
Now I have to tell you that

56:53.511 --> 56:59.017
God Almighty is the ocean of love

56:59.217 --> 57:02.572
and ocean of compassion.

57:03.306 --> 57:07.950
But above all, He is the ocean of forgiveness.

57:21.294 --> 57:26.528
And you cannot do anything that cannot be engulfed

57:26.729 --> 57:29.563
by this ocean of forgiveness.

57:38.071 --> 57:40.763
So now please forgive yourself

57:45.352 --> 57:48.137
and forget about the past things.

57:51.756 --> 57:53.608
Be cheerful.

57:55.638 --> 57:58.453
Now put your right hand,

57:58.654 --> 58:01.337
in the corner,

58:01.537 --> 58:05.657
made by your neck and the left shoulder,

58:06.015 --> 58:10.280
from the front side, not from the back. Don’t take the hand to the back.

58:18.754 --> 58:21.635
From the front side, don’t take it backwards side.

58:21.835 --> 58:24.609
No, no, from the front side, you see, across,

58:24.817 --> 58:27.697
take it across, right hand across.

58:33.878 --> 58:36.759
Take it on the back

58:36.959 --> 58:41.794
and now put your head towards the right,

58:42.419 --> 58:44.697
turn your neck towards the right.

58:47.999 --> 58:51.672
Hold it tight. This is the centre catching today mostly,

58:51.872 --> 58:55.209
because we feel guilty for nothing at all.

59:01.022 --> 59:04.731
So please sixteen times, please say:

59:04.931 --> 59:07.577
“Mother, I am not guilty”.

59:31.418 --> 59:33.301
Better.

59:38.578 --> 59:42.097
Sixteen times and, even now if you are feeling guilty,

59:42.297 --> 59:46.377
then you’d better punish yourselves
by saying hundred and eight times!

59:47.412 --> 59:50.097
There’s nothing to feel guilty at all.

01:00:05.364 --> 01:00:06.949
Better.

01:00:09.041 --> 01:00:12.537
It’s yours Warren, left Nabhi is yours.

01:00:12.970 --> 01:00:15.057
It’s not there anymore.

01:00:15.676 --> 01:00:17.264
Gone up.

01:00:22.675 --> 01:00:24.333
Better?

01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:27.747
Now,

01:00:34.316 --> 01:00:38.777
put your hand on top of your forehead across.

01:00:44.336 --> 01:00:47.737
Now here, not how many times

01:00:47.937 --> 01:00:53.417
but from the heart you have to say: “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

01:00:53.788 --> 01:00:56.217
This is the centre of Christ.

01:01:05.282 --> 01:01:08.719
Now we think that it’s very difficult,

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.558
but it’s a myth.

01:01:10.759 --> 01:01:14.628
We do not do anything when we forgive and when we don’t forgive,

01:01:14.829 --> 01:01:20.162
but when we forgive at least we
don’t play into the hands of wrong people.

01:01:48.808 --> 01:01:52.577
Now put your hand on the back of your head

01:01:52.777 --> 01:01:55.083
and push your head backwards.

01:01:55.283 --> 01:01:59.017
Now here, for your own satisfaction you can say:

01:01:59.217 --> 01:02:02.752
“Oh Divine, please forgive me if I have done anything wrong”:

01:02:02.952 --> 01:02:05.737
for your satisfaction, but don’t feel guilty.

01:02:27.978 --> 01:02:31.305
Now put your hand,

01:02:31.543 --> 01:02:34.448
stretch your palm,

01:02:34.697 --> 01:02:39.257
right hand, on top your head, by stretching your hand,

01:02:39.457 --> 01:02:44.257
the centre of it falling on the centre of the fontanel bone area.

01:02:44.457 --> 01:02:48.217
Press it hard and move it seven times.

01:03:06.104 --> 01:03:11.089
And here you have to say seven times,

01:03:11.290 --> 01:03:16.614
because I respect your freedom, that you want your Self-Realisation:

01:03:16.815 --> 01:03:20.486
“Mother, please grant us Self-Realisation”.

01:03:20.693 --> 01:03:26.064
I cannot force it on you, I’m sorry,
so you have to ask for it seven times.

01:04:15.596 --> 01:04:18.335
Now, take down your hands please.

01:04:21.879 --> 01:04:25.217
Please open your eyes slowly.

01:04:28.370 --> 01:04:30.608
Put both the hands like this.

01:04:34.669 --> 01:04:37.577
Now watch me without thinking.

01:04:42.491 --> 01:04:46.512
Put your left hand on top of your head,

01:04:46.712 --> 01:04:50.177
about two – three inches above.

01:04:51.624 --> 01:04:53.485
Left hand, left hand.

01:04:55.878 --> 01:04:58.137
Right hand towards me like this.

01:05:01.249 --> 01:05:03.057
Little higher,

01:05:03.621 --> 01:05:07.497
Little higher. Sometimes it can be very high also with some people.

01:05:11.487 --> 01:05:14.912
Like this, like this. The other should be like this.

01:05:18.919 --> 01:05:21.273
Do you feel the cool breeze?

01:05:26.062 --> 01:05:30.522
Now put the left hand towards me, and put the right hand and see,

01:05:30.723 --> 01:05:32.763
on top of your head.

01:05:40.326 --> 01:05:42.377
On top of your head.

01:05:46.371 --> 01:05:48.617
Again put the right hand towards me please,

01:05:48.817 --> 01:05:52.792
and see on the left-hand side. This is just to balance.

01:05:57.304 --> 01:05:59.817
Good. It’s better.

01:06:03.412 --> 01:06:07.134
Now you put both your hands to the sky, and push back your head

01:06:07.334 --> 01:06:11.020
and ask a question: “Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”,

01:06:16.606 --> 01:06:20.764
“Is this the all-pervading Power of God?”,

01:06:23.978 --> 01:06:26.337
“Is this the Brahma?”

01:06:27.455 --> 01:06:31.215
Ask the question three times. Push back your head.

01:06:34.391 --> 01:06:36.368
Push back your heads.

01:06:37.787 --> 01:06:41.654
Now bring down your hands. Please bring down your hands.

01:06:44.227 --> 01:06:47.769
Now see, in your hands do you feel the cool breeze?

01:06:49.223 --> 01:06:52.977
Be patient with yourself, it would be there. Just feel it.

01:06:56.992 --> 01:06:59.330
Feel the silence within.

01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:08.197
You’ll feel like laughing, some of you.

01:07:15.817 --> 01:07:19.645
Those who have felt the cool breeze on their head

01:07:19.845 --> 01:07:23.617
or in their hands please raise both your hands.

01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:35.417
Or on your head either.

01:07:37.202 --> 01:07:41.657
It’s quite a lot of people have felt on
the first day. And everybody can feel it.

01:07:41.857 --> 01:07:45.648
It’s very simple, Everybody can feel it.

01:07:45.848 --> 01:07:50.630
Those who have not felt can sit for
one minute like that, let’s see. Just see.

01:07:51.306 --> 01:07:54.770
Without thinking. Just watch me without thinking.

01:08:04.616 --> 01:08:07.510
I think you all have not forgiven.

01:08:08.627 --> 01:08:14.160
Just forgive and it will work out.
Just forgive, the pressure is of not forgiving.

01:08:31.886 --> 01:08:37.437
Now let us see how many have felt it in
their head or in the hands, both the hands up.

01:08:47.602 --> 01:08:52.097
Yes. Some of you who didn’t feel are feeling now.

01:08:52.297 --> 01:08:53.961
It’s good!

01:08:56.499 --> 01:08:59.897
Now don’t discuss about it, don’t talk about it.

01:09:05.939 --> 01:09:08.254
They are going to have follow-on?

01:09:19.170 --> 01:09:21.888
All those who have not felt it should also come,

01:09:22.097 --> 01:09:27.297
they are more there, and those who
have felt should also come and get it up,

01:09:39.208 --> 01:09:40.937
because,

01:09:48.893 --> 01:09:52.266
because you have been seeking for ages now.

01:09:58.105 --> 01:10:00.327
Thank you very much.

01:11:03.353 --> 01:11:06.220
If they want to shake hands, they can come.

01:11:07.559 --> 01:11:10.426
If they want to shake hands, they can come.

01:11:20.307 --> 01:11:23.040
Oh, you are all right, you are all right.

01:11:35.757 --> 01:11:38.000
Keep it up, keep it up.

01:11:40.024 --> 01:11:42.080
You’re from where?
