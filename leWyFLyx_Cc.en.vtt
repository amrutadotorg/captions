00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.060
Shri Matajiyi daha öncesinde dinlediğim için
(Because I had listened to Shri Mataji before)

00:00:53.254 --> 00:00:56.800
Herhalde siz de birşeyler söyleyeceksiniz.

Yogi: All one family.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.215
Large family, yeah.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.909
Welcome in the Mother.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.716
Come along.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.336
After we have so many people.

00:01:40.152 --> 00:01:42.281
You could sit here.

00:01:42.306 --> 00:01:43.635
Come, come here.

00:01:44.026 --> 00:01:45.395
You too come here.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.117
Come along.

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:49.713
Don't feel shy now, come along.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.306
Now we, are we all there?

00:02:15.087 --> 00:02:17.936
Enough for the interview.

00:02:24.866 --> 00:02:26.411
Please sit down.

00:02:28.306 --> 00:02:30.095
She wants to interview, no?

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.335
Interviewer: You have got so many guests, so I take some information

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.715
from her and then ask some questions to you.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.528
Yogini:Maybe it's better to ask Shri Mataji.

00:02:37.553 --> 00:02:39.515
Yogini: Have a tea, having a tea you can ask.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.034
All right, you can ask, all right.

00:02:50.835 --> 00:02:52.875
What is the name of the newspaper?

00:02:52.907 --> 00:02:53.823
Interviewer: Günaydın

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.915
Günaydın?

00:02:56.165 --> 00:02:57.272
Is it in English?

00:02:57.297 --> 00:02:59.572
Interviewer: It is Good Morning in English, no, it's Turkish.

00:02:59.597 --> 00:03:00.275
Turkish.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.561
What do you call it in Turkish for United?

00:03:02.586 --> 00:03:03.771
Interviewer: No, Günaydın

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.135
Interviewer: Good morning.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.100
But what is in Turkish I'm saying for that?

00:03:14.125 --> 00:03:16.620
Yogini: In Turkish it's "günaydın"

00:03:16.645 --> 00:03:19.485
In English it means good morning.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.531
Oh, the same way.

00:03:21.562 --> 00:03:25.696
Interviewer: In the morning when you see
somebody you say "günaydın" in Turkish.

00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:29.491
Like in English you say good morning in the morning time.

00:03:29.516 --> 00:03:30.335
I see.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.539
Interviewer: Like hello in the morning.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.036
I heard good night, I said how can there be good night in the newspaper?

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.560
It's one of the famous newspapers in Turkey.

00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:52.460
Interviewer: How long are you going to stay here?

00:03:52.485 --> 00:03:54.093
I'm here till the 4th.

00:03:54.466 --> 00:03:55.746
Interviewer: Four days.

00:03:56.126 --> 00:03:58.379
Interviewer: First time?

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.766
Second time.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.115
Interviewer: Could you tell me about you a bit?

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.915
Myself?

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.355
Interviewer: Yes, yourself.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.756
What should I tell you?

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.363
I was born in India.

00:04:25.205 --> 00:04:30.180
I knew from my childhood that I have to do this work

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.730
of giving self-realization to people.

00:04:37.595 --> 00:04:41.843
It's a, we're born in a royal family, so ours is a royal family.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.120
And they have also a calendar.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.368
But now it's a long time back they were there.

00:04:51.151 --> 00:04:57.075
And my father also was a great soul.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.415
He was a master of 14 languages.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.404
And he translated Quran-e-Sharif into Hindi language.

00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:06.044
Interviewer: All that is his own purpose.

00:05:08.226 --> 00:05:11.932
My mother was a honors of mathematics.

00:05:17.299 --> 00:05:22.580
But my whole idea was to find out a way any method

00:05:22.605 --> 00:05:26.902
by which I could give amass realization.

00:05:26.927 --> 00:05:33.989
Normally they take one disciple, work hard on that disciple and mostly

00:05:34.642 --> 00:05:36.236
it works, then it's all right.

00:05:36.261 --> 00:05:39.176
Otherwise they say, all right, we can't do it every time.

00:06:16.267 --> 00:06:22.379
So in our country this knowledge was known to us for thousands of years.

00:06:22.406 --> 00:06:28.602
But only, I always say poetically that there were very few flowers on the tree of life.

00:06:28.633 --> 00:06:31.067
So they could not become fruits.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.077
But today I think it's a blossom time.

00:06:55.206 --> 00:07:03.307
And in 1970, 5th May, I discovered a method by which

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.040
I could do that in enmass realization

00:07:15.113 --> 00:07:16.935
It's a happening, actually.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.937
It's an actualization and a happening that takes place.

00:07:21.146 --> 00:07:24.986
You can see in so many people when there is obstruction,

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.957
this power that is in the triangular bone is pulsating.

00:07:28.982 --> 00:07:30.635
You can see it in naked eyes.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.095
And you can also see the rising of this power in some people.

00:07:34.404 --> 00:07:38.446
But those who are quite normal, it just shoots off.

00:07:38.706 --> 00:07:42.894
But otherwise, if there is any obstruction, you can see it.

00:07:43.553 --> 00:07:47.068
This power is in the triangular bone called as sacrum.

00:07:47.093 --> 00:07:51.213
That means sacrum is a word comes from the Greeks.

00:07:51.373 --> 00:07:52.975
So the Greeks knew about it.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.404
That's why they called it sacred.

00:08:11.153 --> 00:08:15.333
Translator: In Turkish also we know it as sacrum.

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.935
Interviewer: How do you see it?

00:08:41.755 --> 00:08:47.608
You see, in the people, as I said, there is obstruction and it's rising.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:53.464
Then you can see it moving like a little movement of a wave, you see.

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:57.147
But it is like you can say a seed.

00:08:57.172 --> 00:09:01.078
If you plant it in the Mother Earth, it sprouts by itself.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.855
In the same way, this is the thing is like a primule,

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.602
like the primule is the germ.

00:09:09.627 --> 00:09:12.787
It just comes up by itself.

00:09:29.298 --> 00:09:32.720
Interviewer: How do you get it to move, to move?

00:09:33.012 --> 00:09:35.835
See, it's so spontaneous, spontaneous.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.995
It is built in you and it is built in me, all right?

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:43.775
It's like the Mother Earth is built in you with that power.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.315
And the seed has got built in it.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:50.143
So when you put the seed in the Mother Earth, it sprouts in the same way.

00:10:06.246 --> 00:10:08.717
Interviewer: Maybe you just show the method.

00:10:08.742 --> 00:10:09.762
No, no, no, no method.

00:10:09.787 --> 00:10:13.068
You see, it's just, even if they put hands like this,

00:10:13.093 --> 00:10:14.921
you see, it works.

00:10:14.946 --> 00:10:17.648
Just putting hands like this, it works.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.913
She might have got it.

00:10:19.938 --> 00:10:21.480
Just see, put it on her head.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.775
You feel a cool breeze in the head?

00:10:26.887 --> 00:10:27.815
Your head.

00:10:27.907 --> 00:10:31.848
Now, but just now see, are you, take out the pencil from her head.

00:10:32.359 --> 00:10:34.079
Just put it on her head.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.149
She's got her eyes open, you know.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.278
Yogi: Yes, she's got it.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.571
Are you feeling it?

00:10:43.596 --> 00:10:44.755
Are you feeling?

00:10:48.266 --> 00:10:50.315
Because I could see your eyes.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.946
You see, the blinking is that way.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.340
But now you see.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:58.795
Shining.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.160
Yogini: Shining, sparkling Mother, all the time.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:03.986
Interviewer: What's this?

00:11:07.253 --> 00:11:09.199
That you become the Spirit.

00:11:11.626 --> 00:11:14.707
And it's so joyous, so joy-giving.

00:11:15.995 --> 00:11:17.915
Interviewer: And then, what happens more?

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.631
Now, now, this, with this you can, you become a collective being.

00:11:21.899 --> 00:11:23.864
Now, you can feel others.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.855
These are all the centers, the three centers within us.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.108
You can feel the centers of another person.

00:11:29.133 --> 00:11:30.713
You can cure others.

00:11:31.366 --> 00:11:33.161
You can give them realization.

00:11:33.186 --> 00:11:34.567
Everything you can.

00:11:39.406 --> 00:11:42.427
Centers, subtle centers, energy.

00:12:26.966 --> 00:12:29.317
Medically it can be explained also.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.375
Yogini: She is surprised?

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.782
That's Turkish, that's Turkish character.

00:12:46.764 --> 00:12:48.795
Don't have to work very hard here.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.321
You just get it like that?

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.595
Interviewer: I was afraid.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.375
No, nothing to be afraid of.

00:12:56.649 --> 00:12:57.848
Interviewer: The first time.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.480
Yes, it's just the first time. Just like that.

00:12:59.505 --> 00:13:00.920
That means you are great.

00:13:02.328 --> 00:13:03.730
Interviewer: I am healty

00:13:03.761 --> 00:13:05.176
Yes, you are cool.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.849
You are cool. Very good.

00:13:08.242 --> 00:13:10.715
And not only, but you get the power now.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.125
You can give opinion to them.

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:13.635
You can raise their Kundalini.

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.695
This is called as Kundalini, this power.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.295
You can give them realization.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.194
You can feel it yourself.

00:13:19.219 --> 00:13:21.091
And you can know what's wrong with them.

00:13:21.116 --> 00:13:23.875
Because the Spirit is the collective being within you.

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:24.995
It's the collective being.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.115
So you become collectively conscious.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:30.761
You are human awareness gets a new dimension.

00:13:50.239 --> 00:13:51.939
Is it in Turkish language?

00:13:52.146 --> 00:13:53.323
Yogi: This is Turkish.

00:14:37.112 --> 00:14:39.255
And you feel absolutely relaxed.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.705
Nothing bothers you.

00:14:49.185 --> 00:14:50.185
Great

00:15:03.747 --> 00:15:06.562
Translator: What is she just asking?

00:15:06.587 --> 00:15:08.095
by this energy

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.940
Are capable to move the things?

00:15:10.993 --> 00:15:12.848
No, that's not important.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.230
That's not a very good thing.

00:15:15.261 --> 00:15:20.538
Also things are moved by the another method, which you call as the Great Avidya.

00:15:20.563 --> 00:15:23.776
Means comes from the symmetry, from the Great.

00:15:25.393 --> 00:15:27.079
That's not a good thing.

00:15:50.581 --> 00:15:52.648
Why do they call you Nirmala?

00:15:53.307 --> 00:15:56.678
Nirmala, my name is Nirmala.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:58.260
Nirmala.

00:15:58.660 --> 00:15:59.000
Devi.

00:15:59.954 --> 00:16:02.755
Devi is called to any woman in India.

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:04.480
It's called Nirmala.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.560
That's the name.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.188
That's my name.

00:16:09.556 --> 00:16:11.562
Sahaja Yogini: It means pure.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:15.044
Yes, it means, Nirmala means pure.

00:16:16.073 --> 00:16:17.399
Immaculate.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.733
Nirmala means, but Devi they put to anyone they can call.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:24.710
Just give respect.

00:16:35.087 --> 00:16:38.882
Interviwer: What is your aim in this Sahaja Yoga?

00:16:41.306 --> 00:16:44.995
Just to give joy to everyone, their own joy.

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:49.346
You see, you have got within yourself this joy in a dormant state.

00:16:49.371 --> 00:16:52.101
Just to expose you to that, that's all.

00:16:52.126 --> 00:16:54.818
And you can't pay for it.

00:16:54.843 --> 00:16:57.637
There is no obligation, nothing.

00:17:12.693 --> 00:17:16.494
Like one candle which is enlightened can enlighten another candle.

00:17:25.743 --> 00:17:28.857
Then we realize that we are all one,

00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:31.277
part and parcel of the whole.

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:42.811

00:17:43.586 --> 00:17:46.959
No agitation, no aggression.

00:17:46.986 --> 00:17:51.969
