00:07:19.226 --> 00:07:22.226
The question was asked Me,

00:07:22.435 --> 00:07:26.810
“What Puja we are going to have today?”

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.060
And I kept it a secret.

00:07:36.476 --> 00:07:41.102
Today we should worship

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.935
the Paramachaitanya,

00:07:44.144 --> 00:07:48.019
the All-Pervading Power of God’s Love.

00:07:59.977 --> 00:08:02.393
We are aware

00:08:03.643 --> 00:08:07.184
that Paramachaitanya

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.351
does everything.

00:08:12.768 --> 00:08:15.476
At least mentally we know

00:08:15.685 --> 00:08:18.685
that everything is worked out

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:22.226
by the grace of Paramachaitanya,

00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:26.518
which is the power of the Adi Shakti.

00:08:27.393 --> 00:08:30.393
But still,

00:08:31.894 --> 00:08:36.852
it is not so much in our heart,

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.810
so much in our attention.

00:08:51.185 --> 00:08:54.643
We can consider Paramachaitanya

00:08:54.852 --> 00:08:57.560
like a ocean,

00:08:59.144 --> 00:09:04.185
like a ocean which contains everything within itself.

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.852
Everything, all the working,

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:15.226
everything, is within its own limits.

00:09:15.435 --> 00:09:20.226
So it cannot be compared with anything. You cannot compare it.

00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:23.852
Now, if you see the sun,

00:09:24.602 --> 00:09:27.935
then from the sun

00:09:28.144 --> 00:09:32.435
the rays have to come out, to work it.

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:38.810
If you see somebody,

00:09:40.852 --> 00:09:44.476
say, a person

00:09:45.476 --> 00:09:48.435
who has an authority,

00:09:50.685 --> 00:09:54.685
he has to assert that power -

00:09:55.518 --> 00:09:57.810
outside.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.144
So within himself

00:10:01.393 --> 00:10:04.185
he doesn’t work it out.

00:10:14.435 --> 00:10:17.226
Say, for example, if there’s a seed

00:10:18.268 --> 00:10:20.435
and inside the seed only

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:25.435
the tree grows, and the fruits come out, and

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.060
then they are sold, and people eat it, and

00:10:29.226 --> 00:10:32.768
everything is inside that seed.

00:10:33.977 --> 00:10:37.144
Then that is Paramachaitanya.

00:10:39.727 --> 00:10:46.184
So we are all enveloped in it.

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:52.019
And only the waves that we see,

00:10:52.185 --> 00:10:55.102
and we are on the waves,

00:10:55.268 --> 00:10:59.019
so we see it as

00:10:59.185 --> 00:11:03.351
dislocated, separated.

00:11:03.894 --> 00:11:08.435
Like we feel “this is Germany”

00:11:10.476 --> 00:11:14.602
or “this is England, this is India.”

00:11:14.852 --> 00:11:19.685
These are just folds of the sari

00:11:20.351 --> 00:11:22.393
of Paramachaitanya

00:11:22.602 --> 00:11:25.226
which look separated,

00:11:25.894 --> 00:11:28.768
but they are not separated.

00:11:29.852 --> 00:11:33.185
They are continuous.

00:11:36.185 --> 00:11:39.810
So the connection is absolutely complete.

00:11:40.268 --> 00:11:43.560
If I pull a thread from here,

00:11:43.768 --> 00:11:47.894
the thread will throughout be pulled.

00:11:50.977 --> 00:11:54.894
In the same manner, this Paramachaitanya

00:11:57.935 --> 00:12:01.685
is working within itself.

00:12:03.935 --> 00:12:07.768
And there is nothing without.

00:12:10.685 --> 00:12:14.476
So, when you are Sahaja Yogis,

00:12:18.602 --> 00:12:22.060
it pays special attention to you.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:26.435
Or, I should say, it becomes absolutely

00:12:26.977 --> 00:12:29.102
one with you.

00:12:29.268 --> 00:12:31.643
Whatever you desire,

00:12:31.852 --> 00:12:35.019
whatever you want,

00:12:35.185 --> 00:12:38.727
also will be coming from the same Paramachaitanya,

00:12:38.935 --> 00:12:41.810
if you are one with it.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.935
Like in a, say,

00:12:47.643 --> 00:12:51.184
turbulent ocean

00:12:53.393 --> 00:12:57.560
some drops of water may fly into the air

00:12:57.977 --> 00:13:02.102
and start thinking that “we are above.”

00:13:03.268 --> 00:13:07.560
We’re away from the world, away from the ocean.

00:13:07.768 --> 00:13:11.560
But again they have to fall into the sea.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:18.935
So this formless energy,

00:13:19.935 --> 00:13:25.060
which has all the intelligence, all the coordination,

00:13:25.351 --> 00:13:27.351
all the organizations,

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.102
all the computers,

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:34.144
all the televisions,

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:38.852
all that you can think of communication

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:42.476
and of governing, of administration,

00:13:42.685 --> 00:13:45.435
and above all,

00:13:47.852 --> 00:13:51.185
it is the Love,

00:13:52.102 --> 00:13:55.144
it is the Love of God

00:13:56.476 --> 00:14:00.060
and Love of your Mother.

00:14:05.476 --> 00:14:11.894
So to be one with this Paramachaitanya,

00:14:14.435 --> 00:14:17.393
you have to know

00:14:17.602 --> 00:14:21.602
that you have to become the reality.

00:14:26.768 --> 00:14:31.727
For example, if you take a photograph of Mine, sitting here,

00:14:35.019 --> 00:14:40.476
Maybe My photograph might give you living vibrations, all right,

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.560
though it’s a photograph.

00:14:50.019 --> 00:14:55.184
But, if you take a photograph of somebody else

00:14:58.852 --> 00:15:04.393
it will not work out Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:06.518 --> 00:15:11.393
The reason is, that somebody else has not become the reality.

00:15:11.894 --> 00:15:15.019
It’s like any other painting if you see,

00:15:15.185 --> 00:15:18.102
supposing you see a painting

00:15:18.268 --> 00:15:21.643
where it is raining.

00:15:22.268 --> 00:15:25.268
This rain does not nourish the flowers.

00:15:25.476 --> 00:15:27.768
It does not

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:37.852
wet the cloth of the people who are there.

00:15:38.144 --> 00:15:40.768
It is static.

00:15:41.518 --> 00:15:44.768
So in ignorance,

00:15:45.852 --> 00:15:48.226
in ignorance,

00:15:48.476 --> 00:15:52.643
we just have the

00:15:54.184 --> 00:15:59.102
picture which is static about reality.

00:16:00.643 --> 00:16:03.560
And that is the reason why

00:16:03.768 --> 00:16:07.019
we think we can work it out

00:16:07.602 --> 00:16:10.310
ourselves, everything.

00:16:11.643 --> 00:16:16.727
Now if somebody says that, “I see this picture,

00:16:18.184 --> 00:16:24.184
all right. And I’ll make the rain as a real thing.”

00:16:24.393 --> 00:16:27.894
You cannot. Try anything,

00:16:28.768 --> 00:16:30.518
put whatever color you like.

00:16:30.727 --> 00:16:33.602
It may appear, it will appear

00:16:34.185 --> 00:16:35.560
with effort.

00:16:35.768 --> 00:16:40.977
But it will not have the capacity,

00:16:43.894 --> 00:16:47.226
nor the nature of reality.

00:16:49.935 --> 00:16:53.268
So human beings always deal

00:16:54.310 --> 00:17:00.310
with unreal things, thinking they are doing something great.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.852
We can get flowers which are real, of course.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:07.685
We can feel them.

00:17:10.768 --> 00:17:13.393
We can create plastic flowers.

00:17:13.602 --> 00:17:18.102
We can create paintings, exactly the same as they are.

00:17:18.268 --> 00:17:22.852
But we can’t produce one flower

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:26.518
on our own.

00:17:32.727 --> 00:17:36.226
We’ll have to go to reality

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.393
is that the Mother Earth is going to produce it,

00:17:42.435 --> 00:17:47.310
or the Sun is going to help the Mother Earth.

00:17:52.351 --> 00:17:56.060
So all of you Sahaja Yogis

00:17:58.518 --> 00:18:01.060
have to know

00:18:01.643 --> 00:18:06.019
that in reality you do not do anything

00:18:06.435 --> 00:18:09.810
and everything is done by Paramachaitanya.

00:18:10.184 --> 00:18:14.935
This is the difference between a non-Sahaja Yogi and a Sahaja Yogi.

00:18:15.144 --> 00:18:20.185
A non-Sahaja Yogi does not know.

00:18:21.727 --> 00:18:26.393
And even if he knows, this is not

00:18:26.602 --> 00:18:29.310
the truth in his heart.

00:18:29.518 --> 00:18:32.435
It’s not a part and parcel of his being.

00:18:32.643 --> 00:18:37.184
But a Sahaja Yogi knows that

00:18:37.894 --> 00:18:40.894
reality is Paramachaitanya

00:18:41.102 --> 00:18:45.144
and it is reality that works out everything.

00:18:47.268 --> 00:18:50.435
And then this reality is

00:18:50.643 --> 00:18:53.727
the Divine Love.

00:18:55.351 --> 00:18:58.685
We always separate love from action.

00:18:59.602 --> 00:19:02.935
To us love means

00:19:05.351 --> 00:19:10.685
some sort of a mad behavior towards a person.

00:19:12.935 --> 00:19:17.184
It has no technical know-how, how to love.

00:19:18.019 --> 00:19:22.435
It works without any understanding.

00:19:24.268 --> 00:19:27.060
When we love somebody,

00:19:27.226 --> 00:19:31.184
we don’t know, what do we do?

00:19:32.184 --> 00:19:34.935
We think we love you.

00:19:35.144 --> 00:19:38.351
Tomorrow we start saying, “I hate you.”

00:19:38.894 --> 00:19:41.894
So how can it be love?

00:19:45.727 --> 00:19:49.727
We love our own children, love our own family,

00:19:49.935 --> 00:19:53.435
love our own friends,

00:19:53.685 --> 00:19:56.643
which is so unreal.

00:19:57.852 --> 00:20:00.435
If it was real,

00:20:01.685 --> 00:20:04.393
it would never have failed.

00:20:06.184 --> 00:20:08.727
That you cannot definitely say

00:20:08.935 --> 00:20:11.518
that, all right, today you’ll work for your son

00:20:11.727 --> 00:20:14.435
and be very selfish about your son.

00:20:14.643 --> 00:20:16.894
But you can’t say tomorrow how he will treat you

00:20:17.102 --> 00:20:19.768
or you’ll treat him.

00:20:23.727 --> 00:20:26.768
But Paramachaitanya knows.

00:20:27.768 --> 00:20:31.977
It knows how to express its love.

00:20:33.393 --> 00:20:35.643
Not only that,

00:20:35.852 --> 00:20:40.351
but it’s an eternal feeling of love,

00:20:42.852 --> 00:20:46.643
which may change its hue, color,

00:20:50.268 --> 00:20:52.019
but

00:20:53.226 --> 00:20:57.602
the concern of that love will be the same.

00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:01.602
The essence of love is concern.

00:21:02.643 --> 00:21:06.226
Even if, supposing, somebody does wrong,

00:21:06.435 --> 00:21:10.060
the concern of the Divine would be to correct that person.

00:21:10.226 --> 00:21:12.768
Concern.

00:21:13.144 --> 00:21:16.393
Or if we say as “Hita”,

00:21:16.935 --> 00:21:19.102
is the benevolence.

00:21:19.268 --> 00:21:21.894
So the concern for the benevolence

00:21:22.102 --> 00:21:24.226
will be all the time there,

00:21:24.435 --> 00:21:28.894
whether it may appear to be, sometimes, cruel,

00:21:29.102 --> 00:21:31.602
might appear to be affectionate,

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:33.852
might appear to be over-indulgent.

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:37.727
Whatever it may take a form, like a wave.

00:21:38.685 --> 00:21:42.144
Whichever way it may look, but actually,

00:21:42.852 --> 00:21:45.768
it’s for your benevolence.

00:21:46.768 --> 00:21:50.060
It works for your benevolence.

00:21:50.643 --> 00:21:53.060
Not only your benevolence,

00:21:53.226 --> 00:21:56.935
but the collective benevolence.

00:21:59.019 --> 00:22:02.643
And it knows very well what is to be done

00:22:02.852 --> 00:22:05.727
how it is to be worked out.

00:22:07.852 --> 00:22:11.019
It does not have to go and learn from anywhere

00:22:11.185 --> 00:22:14.643
because the complete knowledge of all this know-how

00:22:14.852 --> 00:22:18.102
also is within itself.

00:22:21.019 --> 00:22:24.184
It’s such a storage

00:22:25.643 --> 00:22:30.727
of wisdom, knowledge and love.

00:22:32.768 --> 00:22:35.894
So it does not deviate.

00:22:36.184 --> 00:22:40.643
Once you become a Sahaja Yogi, the concern

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.977
for your benevolence

00:22:46.184 --> 00:22:49.435
is all the time there.

00:22:49.727 --> 00:22:54.351
Whether you are punished or not is a different point.

00:22:54.727 --> 00:22:58.019
Some people might get a job.

00:22:58.185 --> 00:23:01.560
Some people will not get a job.

00:23:01.768 --> 00:23:03.685
With some people it will work out this way.

00:23:03.894 --> 00:23:06.810
With some people it will not work out that way.

00:23:07.019 --> 00:23:09.268
Then one may say that, “How is it, this Paramachaitanya

00:23:09.476 --> 00:23:11.268
is behaving like this?”

00:23:11.476 --> 00:23:13.393
Is all for your correction.

00:23:13.602 --> 00:23:16.310
Is a big churning.

00:23:16.643 --> 00:23:18.894
Whatever works out for your correction

00:23:19.102 --> 00:23:21.144
and is for your benevolence.

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:23.393
If you understand this point,

00:23:23.602 --> 00:23:27.102
then you’ll never be disappointed in your life.

00:23:34.019 --> 00:23:37.393
And it has no concern

00:23:37.602 --> 00:23:39.935
of its own benevolence,

00:23:40.144 --> 00:23:44.102
because it is complete benevolence itself.

00:23:46.894 --> 00:23:51.185
It never thinks how it is going to be benevolent

00:23:52.144 --> 00:23:57.643
or helpful, because it has no botheration about it.

00:23:57.852 --> 00:24:01.894
A man, say, who has everything,

00:24:02.102 --> 00:24:03.894
worldly things,

00:24:04.102 --> 00:24:06.768
still may be concerned about getting more,

00:24:06.977 --> 00:24:09.268
the greed, there would be.

00:24:09.476 --> 00:24:13.185
But as it is the complete, Purna,

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:16.685
it has no greed.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.810
It’s fully satisfied with itself.

00:24:22.435 --> 00:24:25.643
And because it is so powerful,

00:24:26.268 --> 00:24:28.602
so knowledgeable,

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.977
that it has no doubts,

00:24:32.685 --> 00:24:35.144
no doubts of any kind.

00:24:36.226 --> 00:24:38.685
And because

00:24:39.435 --> 00:24:42.977
there’s nobody which can harm it,

00:24:43.268 --> 00:24:46.268
it has no fear.

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.268
And you all have now felt

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:58.643
that Paramachaitanya,

00:25:00.184 --> 00:25:05.060
should give you a complete fearless life,

00:25:05.226 --> 00:25:08.185
a peaceful life,

00:25:08.727 --> 00:25:10.935
and a joyous life.

00:25:11.185 --> 00:25:16.351
Like a child who finds his mother, then he stops crying,

00:25:18.393 --> 00:25:20.602
no more, now he’s found his mother.

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:24.810
In the same way you have found Paramachaitanya

00:25:25.019 --> 00:25:27.810
and the connection with it.

00:25:28.144 --> 00:25:32.185
So you don’t have to worry for anything,

00:25:32.977 --> 00:25:34.768
don’t have to think about anything,

00:25:34.977 --> 00:25:37.435
you don’t have to plan about anything,

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:40.060
only thing is you have to jump into it,

00:25:40.226 --> 00:25:43.310
just jump into it

00:25:44.727 --> 00:25:49.935
and know that you have become part and parcel of the reality.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:58.268
This if you have understood, I think, we have done a big job.

00:26:01.184 --> 00:26:04.060
Now we are in Germany,

00:26:04.226 --> 00:26:07.351
and you know in Germany

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.810
there have been people who have

00:26:12.184 --> 00:26:16.184
tried to shatter the hopes of human beings.

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.768
But

00:26:19.977 --> 00:26:23.727
even that happening that took place,

00:26:24.351 --> 00:26:28.393
all those horrible things happened, that so many people died,

00:26:28.602 --> 00:26:31.852
of course they are born again, no problem,

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:35.351
and such problems came up

00:26:37.185 --> 00:26:40.268
that they were

00:26:41.727 --> 00:26:44.019
thinking that

00:26:44.518 --> 00:26:47.144
the whole world will be finished.

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:50.351
They were so much worried,

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.727
they thought that the whole world will be finished.

00:26:55.185 --> 00:26:57.144
But did not.

00:26:57.310 --> 00:27:01.518
But this war has taught us a lesson.

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:07.518
It has made us more collective.

00:27:08.102 --> 00:27:11.144
It has made us understand each other.

00:27:12.102 --> 00:27:15.393
Otherwise, how do you come out of the ignorance

00:27:15.602 --> 00:27:18.935
that “we are this country”, “we are that country”,

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:21.185
racialism,

00:27:21.393 --> 00:27:24.102
then this so-called nationalism,

00:27:24.268 --> 00:27:26.351
so-called patriotism -

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:31.019
all these separating forces,

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.894
divisive things.

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:40.560
Saw clearly we are all human beings

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:45.643
and we should be treated as human beings.

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:50.019
If you see the history, after every war

00:27:50.185 --> 00:27:56.435
there has been a speedy movement towards knowledge,

00:27:56.768 --> 00:28:00.184
knowledge of oneness of the world.

00:28:01.351 --> 00:28:03.727
It is something

00:28:05.351 --> 00:28:09.144
like, you have in a spacecraft

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:13.184
that a container is built in,

00:28:14.977 --> 00:28:18.351
one into another,

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:23.935
and the whole thing

00:28:25.184 --> 00:28:30.476
comes into a speed, some velocity,

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:35.602
and then the lower container bursts,

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:38.602
or explodes.

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:42.810
When it explodes, it gives a higher speed

00:28:43.685 --> 00:28:46.144
to the rest of it.

00:28:46.643 --> 00:28:51.685
And so the acceleration of the velocity takes place.

00:28:52.184 --> 00:28:56.184
And that’s how one can go into the space.

00:28:57.768 --> 00:29:00.602
In the same manner,

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:04.310
all these horrible things that have happened

00:29:05.019 --> 00:29:07.935
are explosions

00:29:08.768 --> 00:29:11.768
which brings you

00:29:13.852 --> 00:29:16.768
towards knowledge

00:29:17.019 --> 00:29:18.977
that there’s something wrong with us,

00:29:19.184 --> 00:29:22.894
we are living with something unreal.

00:29:24.435 --> 00:29:29.226
Now the problems, today’s problems as they are,

00:29:35.351 --> 00:29:38.393
like ecology problem,

00:29:41.685 --> 00:29:43.184
AIDS,

00:29:44.268 --> 00:29:46.102
drugs,

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:52.977
all these modern problems and poverty,

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:57.351
if you see it like a witness, you will see

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:00.268
these are quite shocking.

00:30:01.393 --> 00:30:03.810
These are very shocking things.

00:30:04.019 --> 00:30:08.518
And all these shocking things should really shock our mind,

00:30:09.185 --> 00:30:12.226
should really shock our mind.

00:30:12.977 --> 00:30:16.185
Why we have these problems?

00:30:18.685 --> 00:30:22.894
And these problems, some of the stupid leaders think

00:30:23.102 --> 00:30:26.643
that we can solve by making more money.

00:30:27.685 --> 00:30:31.935
We can protect ourselves from ecology if we have more money.

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:36.977
And that we can pollute the atmosphere

00:30:37.185 --> 00:30:39.185
because we will have more money.

00:30:39.393 --> 00:30:41.977
And then we can protect ourselves

00:30:42.184 --> 00:30:44.518
so that everybody will have to have a mask,

00:30:44.727 --> 00:30:47.268
moving about all over the place.

00:30:47.643 --> 00:30:52.060
But we should make more money to protect ourselves.

00:30:52.226 --> 00:30:56.060
Doesn’t matter if there is ecological problem, doesn’t matter.

00:30:57.019 --> 00:30:58.768
So you move about

00:30:58.977 --> 00:31:01.560
like a person who is entering

00:31:01.768 --> 00:31:05.727
into the area which is all full of fumes.

00:31:08.894 --> 00:31:11.768
All these stupid ideas come up because

00:31:11.977 --> 00:31:13.727
they do not see

00:31:13.935 --> 00:31:17.185
that, what is human dignity is,

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:22.351
that human beings are above

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:26.518
everything else - above machinery,

00:31:26.727 --> 00:31:30.685
above all material things of the world.

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:35.560
They will not talk, that we'll balance the machinery. No.

00:31:36.393 --> 00:31:39.226
What they will talk, that we'll make a man

00:31:39.435 --> 00:31:42.102
a greater slave of the machinery

00:31:42.268 --> 00:31:44.184
because he must have money.

00:31:44.351 --> 00:31:48.019
He must have more money, and with this more money,

00:31:48.185 --> 00:31:52.310
we can protect ourselves against this ecological problem.

00:31:52.643 --> 00:31:55.102
It is absurd.

00:31:56.393 --> 00:32:00.144
But if you understand the human dignity,

00:32:00.476 --> 00:32:03.518
then you have to understand that

00:32:03.727 --> 00:32:06.727
as a human being,

00:32:09.435 --> 00:32:13.810
we have to take a very positive,

00:32:14.019 --> 00:32:18.435
wise step to stop all the nonsense we have been doing.

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:25.685
Like, now most of the

00:32:26.894 --> 00:32:28.435
French

00:32:30.102 --> 00:32:31.435
shores,

00:32:32.184 --> 00:32:35.685
the beaches, are polluted.

00:32:36.184 --> 00:32:38.185
Naturally.

00:32:38.852 --> 00:32:40.351
Because they started a funny thing

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:43.310
called “holiday making on the seashore.”

00:32:44.268 --> 00:32:46.060
So this is the result.

00:32:46.226 --> 00:32:48.184
Now, do what you please.

00:32:48.351 --> 00:32:51.643
You cannot do all that. It has stopped.

00:32:51.852 --> 00:32:54.184
So instead of - now human brain is such,

00:32:54.393 --> 00:32:57.727
instead of understanding that we have done something wrong,

00:32:57.935 --> 00:33:01.185
oh, they will say, “We will start some new method

00:33:01.393 --> 00:33:03.810
of cleansing this.”

00:33:04.019 --> 00:33:06.560
They will never condemn

00:33:06.768 --> 00:33:08.727
what has gone wrong with them

00:33:08.935 --> 00:33:12.226
that they have become so addicted to this kind of a

00:33:12.435 --> 00:33:16.019
funny life that they have on the seashores.

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.435
Now, AIDS.

00:33:18.643 --> 00:33:21.685
You’ll be amazed that in America

00:33:22.226 --> 00:33:25.435
why, even they said that

00:33:25.727 --> 00:33:29.268
there were in Los Angeles, itself,

00:33:29.602 --> 00:33:32.894
seven hundred thousand people

00:33:33.435 --> 00:33:36.977
who glorified themselves as martyrs of AIDS

00:33:37.184 --> 00:33:41.019
because they are achieving such a great goal

00:33:42.685 --> 00:33:46.393
of leading a life which is nonsensical,

00:33:46.727 --> 00:33:49.894
as if like a big revolution.

00:33:50.977 --> 00:33:54.768
And thinking that they are very, very

00:33:54.977 --> 00:33:58.351
great revolutionaries, great people,

00:33:58.643 --> 00:34:02.060
that they are supporting this AIDS

00:34:05.019 --> 00:34:09.393
disease and glorifying it.

00:34:10.685 --> 00:34:13.060
Can you believe

00:34:13.351 --> 00:34:17.560
that this kind of

00:34:17.768 --> 00:34:21.685
assertion will be accepted?

00:34:23.102 --> 00:34:25.935
People will laugh at you.

00:34:26.852 --> 00:34:29.810
But everything is so money-oriented.

00:34:30.019 --> 00:34:31.852
They like to advertise it.

00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:34.393
They want to talk about money help.

00:34:34.602 --> 00:34:37.643
They want to say that this is happening because

00:34:39.476 --> 00:34:41.185
if they had more money,

00:34:41.393 --> 00:34:44.768
they would have taken more drugs.

00:34:45.435 --> 00:34:48.184
Because they have no money, that’s why they are thieving.

00:34:48.351 --> 00:34:51.852
So we must give them money so that they can take drugs,

00:34:53.268 --> 00:34:55.977
or they can take to this kind of life.

00:34:56.184 --> 00:34:58.727
On the whole, if you see,

00:34:58.935 --> 00:35:00.977
people have lived

00:35:01.184 --> 00:35:03.935
with something which is so unreal

00:35:04.144 --> 00:35:07.144
all their lives, absolutely unreal.

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:10.935
And when it comes to facing it,

00:35:11.144 --> 00:35:13.518
that we’ve done a mistake,

00:35:13.727 --> 00:35:16.685
we should not have done this mistake;

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:19.602
then they retreat

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:22.894
and take another glorious

00:35:23.102 --> 00:35:26.268
image, artificial and unreal,

00:35:26.476 --> 00:35:29.935
saying  “Oh, we are great, we are martyrs.”

00:35:34.977 --> 00:35:39.768
And this is what is, what we call is Kali Yuga

00:35:39.977 --> 00:35:44.852
where everything that is ignoble, everything that is to be detested,

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:49.226
everything from which we should have protection will become

00:35:49.435 --> 00:35:53.977
the goal of people to achieve.

00:35:54.685 --> 00:35:57.560
I hope you have understood

00:35:57.768 --> 00:36:02.144
that the All-Pervading Power around us

00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:05.019
is the one that is doing Sahaja Yoga,

00:36:05.185 --> 00:36:07.560
is the one that has brought you to Sahaja Yoga,

00:36:07.768 --> 00:36:11.184
and is the one who has given you blessings,

00:36:11.351 --> 00:36:12.643
is Paramachaitanya.

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:17.560
Through which it has worked out.

00:36:17.768 --> 00:36:22.310
So today’s prayer should be that we be more and more aware

00:36:22.518 --> 00:36:26.560
that we are part and parcel of that Paramachaitanya

00:36:26.768 --> 00:36:29.226
and that we can feel that,

00:36:29.435 --> 00:36:33.518
we can use that power, we can work it out.

00:36:33.727 --> 00:36:36.476
If it is felt today that way,

00:36:36.685 --> 00:36:40.102
I think lot of work has been done already

00:36:40.268 --> 00:36:42.102
and may God bless you for that.

00:37:56.435 --> 00:37:57.768
Now.

00:38:00.393 --> 00:38:04.144
So when you are doing this Puja, please remember

00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:07.643
that you are worshipping Me as Paramachaitanya

00:38:07.852 --> 00:38:12.019
and so you have to just think

00:38:12.185 --> 00:38:15.977
that you’re dealing with reality itself.

00:38:20.351 --> 00:38:23.768
With that understanding, you have to do this Puja.

00:38:30.977 --> 00:38:33.268
May God bless you.
