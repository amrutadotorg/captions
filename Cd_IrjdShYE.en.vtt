WEBVTT

07:19.226 --> 07:22.226
The question was asked Me,

07:22.435 --> 07:26.810
“What Puja we are going to have today?”

07:28.060 --> 07:31.060
And I kept it a secret.

07:36.476 --> 07:41.102
Today we should worship

07:41.310 --> 07:43.935
the Paramachaitanya,

07:44.144 --> 07:48.019
the All-Pervading Power of God’s Love.

07:59.977 --> 08:02.393
We are aware

08:03.643 --> 08:07.184
that Paramachaitanya

08:08.810 --> 08:11.351
does everything.

08:12.768 --> 08:15.476
At least mentally we know

08:15.685 --> 08:18.685
that everything is worked out

08:19.310 --> 08:22.226
by the grace of Paramachaitanya,

08:22.435 --> 08:26.518
which is the power of the Adi Shakti.

08:27.393 --> 08:30.393
But still,

08:31.894 --> 08:36.852
it is not so much in our heart,

08:44.060 --> 08:47.810
so much in our attention.

08:51.185 --> 08:54.643
We can consider Paramachaitanya

08:54.852 --> 08:57.560
like a ocean,

08:59.144 --> 09:04.185
like a ocean which contains everything within itself.

09:05.310 --> 09:08.852
Everything, all the working,

09:10.310 --> 09:15.226
everything, is within its own limits.

09:15.435 --> 09:20.226
So it cannot be compared with anything. You cannot compare it.

09:20.435 --> 09:23.852
Now, if you see the sun,

09:24.602 --> 09:27.935
then from the sun

09:28.144 --> 09:32.435
the rays have to come out, to work it.

09:34.810 --> 09:38.810
If you see somebody,

09:40.852 --> 09:44.476
say, a person

09:45.476 --> 09:48.435
who has an authority,

09:50.685 --> 09:54.685
he has to assert that power -

09:55.518 --> 09:57.810
outside.

09:58.060 --> 10:01.144
So within himself

10:01.393 --> 10:04.185
he doesn’t work it out.

10:14.435 --> 10:17.226
Say, for example, if there’s a seed

10:18.268 --> 10:20.435
and inside the seed only

10:20.810 --> 10:25.435
the tree grows, and the fruits come out, and

10:26.310 --> 10:29.060
then they are sold, and people eat it, and

10:29.226 --> 10:32.768
everything is inside that seed.

10:33.977 --> 10:37.144
Then that is Paramachaitanya.

10:39.727 --> 10:46.184
So we are all enveloped in it.

10:48.060 --> 10:52.019
And only the waves that we see,

10:52.185 --> 10:55.102
and we are on the waves,

10:55.268 --> 10:59.019
so we see it as

10:59.185 --> 11:03.351
dislocated, separated.

11:03.894 --> 11:08.435
Like we feel “this is Germany”

11:10.476 --> 11:14.602
or “this is England, this is India.”

11:14.852 --> 11:19.685
These are just folds of the sari

11:20.351 --> 11:22.393
of Paramachaitanya

11:22.602 --> 11:25.226
which look separated,

11:25.894 --> 11:28.768
but they are not separated.

11:29.852 --> 11:33.185
They are continuous.

11:36.185 --> 11:39.810
So the connection is absolutely complete.

11:40.268 --> 11:43.560
If I pull a thread from here,

11:43.768 --> 11:47.894
the thread will throughout be pulled.

11:50.977 --> 11:54.894
In the same manner, this Paramachaitanya

11:57.935 --> 12:01.685
is working within itself.

12:03.935 --> 12:07.768
And there is nothing without.

12:10.685 --> 12:14.476
So, when you are Sahaja Yogis,

12:18.602 --> 12:22.060
it pays special attention to you.

12:22.310 --> 12:26.435
Or, I should say, it becomes absolutely

12:26.977 --> 12:29.102
one with you.

12:29.268 --> 12:31.643
Whatever you desire,

12:31.852 --> 12:35.019
whatever you want,

12:35.185 --> 12:38.727
also will be coming from the same Paramachaitanya,

12:38.935 --> 12:41.810
if you are one with it.

12:43.060 --> 12:45.935
Like in a, say,

12:47.643 --> 12:51.184
turbulent ocean

12:53.393 --> 12:57.560
some drops of water may fly into the air

12:57.977 --> 13:02.102
and start thinking that “we are above.”

13:03.268 --> 13:07.560
We’re away from the world, away from the ocean.

13:07.768 --> 13:11.560
But again they have to fall into the sea.

13:14.560 --> 13:18.935
So this formless energy,

13:19.935 --> 13:25.060
which has all the intelligence, all the coordination,

13:25.351 --> 13:27.351
all the organizations,

13:27.560 --> 13:30.102
all the computers,

13:31.810 --> 13:34.144
all the televisions,

13:34.810 --> 13:38.852
all that you can think of communication

13:39.060 --> 13:42.476
and of governing, of administration,

13:42.685 --> 13:45.435
and above all,

13:47.852 --> 13:51.185
it is the Love,

13:52.102 --> 13:55.144
it is the Love of God

13:56.476 --> 14:00.060
and Love of your Mother.

14:05.476 --> 14:11.894
So to be one with this Paramachaitanya,

14:14.435 --> 14:17.393
you have to know

14:17.602 --> 14:21.602
that you have to become the reality.

14:26.768 --> 14:31.727
For example, if you take a photograph of Mine, sitting here,

14:35.019 --> 14:40.476
Maybe My photograph might give you living vibrations, all right,

14:42.560 --> 14:45.560
though it’s a photograph.

14:50.019 --> 14:55.184
But, if you take a photograph of somebody else

14:58.852 --> 15:04.393
it will not work out Sahaja Yoga.

15:06.518 --> 15:11.393
The reason is, that somebody else has not become the reality.

15:11.894 --> 15:15.019
It’s like any other painting if you see,

15:15.185 --> 15:18.102
supposing you see a painting

15:18.268 --> 15:21.643
where it is raining.

15:22.268 --> 15:25.268
This rain does not nourish the flowers.

15:25.476 --> 15:27.768
It does not

15:33.810 --> 15:37.852
wet the cloth of the people who are there.

15:38.144 --> 15:40.768
It is static.

15:41.518 --> 15:44.768
So in ignorance,

15:45.852 --> 15:48.226
in ignorance,

15:48.476 --> 15:52.643
we just have the

15:54.184 --> 15:59.102
picture which is static about reality.

16:00.643 --> 16:03.560
And that is the reason why

16:03.768 --> 16:07.019
we think we can work it out

16:07.602 --> 16:10.310
ourselves, everything.

16:11.643 --> 16:16.727
Now if somebody says that, “I see this picture,

16:18.184 --> 16:24.184
all right. And I’ll make the rain as a real thing.”

16:24.393 --> 16:27.894
You cannot. Try anything,

16:28.768 --> 16:30.518
put whatever color you like.

16:30.727 --> 16:33.602
It may appear, it will appear

16:34.185 --> 16:35.560
with effort.

16:35.768 --> 16:40.977
But it will not have the capacity,

16:43.894 --> 16:47.226
nor the nature of reality.

16:49.935 --> 16:53.268
So human beings always deal

16:54.310 --> 17:00.310
with unreal things, thinking they are doing something great.

17:02.560 --> 17:04.852
We can get flowers which are real, of course.

17:05.060 --> 17:07.685
We can feel them.

17:10.768 --> 17:13.393
We can create plastic flowers.

17:13.602 --> 17:18.102
We can create paintings, exactly the same as they are.

17:18.268 --> 17:22.852
But we can’t produce one flower

17:23.810 --> 17:26.518
on our own.

17:32.727 --> 17:36.226
We’ll have to go to reality

17:37.060 --> 17:40.393
is that the Mother Earth is going to produce it,

17:42.435 --> 17:47.310
or the Sun is going to help the Mother Earth.

17:52.351 --> 17:56.060
So all of you Sahaja Yogis

17:58.518 --> 18:01.060
have to know

18:01.643 --> 18:06.019
that in reality you do not do anything

18:06.435 --> 18:09.810
and everything is done by Paramachaitanya.

18:10.184 --> 18:14.935
This is the difference between a non-Sahaja Yogi and a Sahaja Yogi.

18:15.144 --> 18:20.185
A non-Sahaja Yogi does not know.

18:21.727 --> 18:26.393
And even if he knows, this is not

18:26.602 --> 18:29.310
the truth in his heart.

18:29.518 --> 18:32.435
It’s not a part and parcel of his being.

18:32.643 --> 18:37.184
But a Sahaja Yogi knows that

18:37.894 --> 18:40.894
reality is Paramachaitanya

18:41.102 --> 18:45.144
and it is reality that works out everything.

18:47.268 --> 18:50.435
And then this reality is

18:50.643 --> 18:53.727
the Divine Love.

18:55.351 --> 18:58.685
We always separate love from action.

18:59.602 --> 19:02.935
To us love means

19:05.351 --> 19:10.685
some sort of a mad behavior towards a person.

19:12.935 --> 19:17.184
It has no technical know-how, how to love.

19:18.019 --> 19:22.435
It works without any understanding.

19:24.268 --> 19:27.060
When we love somebody,

19:27.226 --> 19:31.184
we don’t know, what do we do?

19:32.184 --> 19:34.935
We think we love you.

19:35.144 --> 19:38.351
Tomorrow we start saying, “I hate you.”

19:38.894 --> 19:41.894
So how can it be love?

19:45.727 --> 19:49.727
We love our own children, love our own family,

19:49.935 --> 19:53.435
love our own friends,

19:53.685 --> 19:56.643
which is so unreal.

19:57.852 --> 20:00.435
If it was real,

20:01.685 --> 20:04.393
it would never have failed.

20:06.184 --> 20:08.727
That you cannot definitely say

20:08.935 --> 20:11.518
that, all right, today you’ll work for your son

20:11.727 --> 20:14.435
and be very selfish about your son.

20:14.643 --> 20:16.894
But you can’t say tomorrow how he will treat you

20:17.102 --> 20:19.768
or you’ll treat him.

20:23.727 --> 20:26.768
But Paramachaitanya knows.

20:27.768 --> 20:31.977
It knows how to express its love.

20:33.393 --> 20:35.643
Not only that,

20:35.852 --> 20:40.351
but it’s an eternal feeling of love,

20:42.852 --> 20:46.643
which may change its hue, color,

20:50.268 --> 20:52.019
but

20:53.226 --> 20:57.602
the concern of that love will be the same.

20:57.810 --> 21:01.602
The essence of love is concern.

21:02.643 --> 21:06.226
Even if, supposing, somebody does wrong,

21:06.435 --> 21:10.060
the concern of the Divine would be to correct that person.

21:10.226 --> 21:12.768
Concern.

21:13.144 --> 21:16.393
Or if we say as “Hita”,

21:16.935 --> 21:19.102
is the benevolence.

21:19.268 --> 21:21.894
So the concern for the benevolence

21:22.102 --> 21:24.226
will be all the time there,

21:24.435 --> 21:28.894
whether it may appear to be, sometimes, cruel,

21:29.102 --> 21:31.602
might appear to be affectionate,

21:31.810 --> 21:33.852
might appear to be over-indulgent.

21:34.060 --> 21:37.727
Whatever it may take a form, like a wave.

21:38.685 --> 21:42.144
Whichever way it may look, but actually,

21:42.852 --> 21:45.768
it’s for your benevolence.

21:46.768 --> 21:50.060
It works for your benevolence.

21:50.643 --> 21:53.060
Not only your benevolence,

21:53.226 --> 21:56.935
but the collective benevolence.

21:59.019 --> 22:02.643
And it knows very well what is to be done

22:02.852 --> 22:05.727
how it is to be worked out.

22:07.852 --> 22:11.019
It does not have to go and learn from anywhere

22:11.185 --> 22:14.643
because the complete knowledge of all this know-how

22:14.852 --> 22:18.102
also is within itself.

22:21.019 --> 22:24.184
It’s such a storage

22:25.643 --> 22:30.727
of wisdom, knowledge and love.

22:32.768 --> 22:35.894
So it does not deviate.

22:36.184 --> 22:40.643
Once you become a Sahaja Yogi, the concern

22:42.560 --> 22:45.977
for your benevolence

22:46.184 --> 22:49.435
is all the time there.

22:49.727 --> 22:54.351
Whether you are punished or not is a different point.

22:54.727 --> 22:58.019
Some people might get a job.

22:58.185 --> 23:01.560
Some people will not get a job.

23:01.768 --> 23:03.685
With some people it will work out this way.

23:03.894 --> 23:06.810
With some people it will not work out that way.

23:07.019 --> 23:09.268
Then one may say that, “How is it, this Paramachaitanya

23:09.476 --> 23:11.268
is behaving like this?”

23:11.476 --> 23:13.393
Is all for your correction.

23:13.602 --> 23:16.310
Is a big churning.

23:16.643 --> 23:18.894
Whatever works out for your correction

23:19.102 --> 23:21.144
and is for your benevolence.

23:21.310 --> 23:23.393
If you understand this point,

23:23.602 --> 23:27.102
then you’ll never be disappointed in your life.

23:34.019 --> 23:37.393
And it has no concern

23:37.602 --> 23:39.935
of its own benevolence,

23:40.144 --> 23:44.102
because it is complete benevolence itself.

23:46.894 --> 23:51.185
It never thinks how it is going to be benevolent

23:52.144 --> 23:57.643
or helpful, because it has no botheration about it.

23:57.852 --> 24:01.894
A man, say, who has everything,

24:02.102 --> 24:03.894
worldly things,

24:04.102 --> 24:06.768
still may be concerned about getting more,

24:06.977 --> 24:09.268
the greed, there would be.

24:09.476 --> 24:13.185
But as it is the complete, Purna,

24:14.310 --> 24:16.685
it has no greed.

24:18.560 --> 24:21.810
It’s fully satisfied with itself.

24:22.435 --> 24:25.643
And because it is so powerful,

24:26.268 --> 24:28.602
so knowledgeable,

24:28.810 --> 24:31.977
that it has no doubts,

24:32.685 --> 24:35.144
no doubts of any kind.

24:36.226 --> 24:38.685
And because

24:39.435 --> 24:42.977
there’s nobody which can harm it,

24:43.268 --> 24:46.268
it has no fear.

24:50.560 --> 24:54.268
And you all have now felt

24:54.560 --> 24:58.643
that Paramachaitanya,

25:00.184 --> 25:05.060
should give you a complete fearless life,

25:05.226 --> 25:08.185
a peaceful life,

25:08.727 --> 25:10.935
and a joyous life.

25:11.185 --> 25:16.351
Like a child who finds his mother, then he stops crying,

25:18.393 --> 25:20.602
no more, now he’s found his mother.

25:20.810 --> 25:24.810
In the same way you have found Paramachaitanya

25:25.019 --> 25:27.810
and the connection with it.

25:28.144 --> 25:32.185
So you don’t have to worry for anything,

25:32.977 --> 25:34.768
don’t have to think about anything,

25:34.977 --> 25:37.435
you don’t have to plan about anything,

25:37.810 --> 25:40.060
only thing is you have to jump into it,

25:40.226 --> 25:43.310
just jump into it

25:44.727 --> 25:49.935
and know that you have become part and parcel of the reality.

25:53.060 --> 25:58.268
This if you have understood, I think, we have done a big job.

26:01.184 --> 26:04.060
Now we are in Germany,

26:04.226 --> 26:07.351
and you know in Germany

26:07.560 --> 26:10.810
there have been people who have

26:12.184 --> 26:16.184
tried to shatter the hopes of human beings.

26:17.560 --> 26:19.768
But

26:19.977 --> 26:23.727
even that happening that took place,

26:24.351 --> 26:28.393
all those horrible things happened, that so many people died,

26:28.602 --> 26:31.852
of course they are born again, no problem,

26:32.310 --> 26:35.351
and such problems came up

26:37.185 --> 26:40.268
that they were

26:41.727 --> 26:44.019
thinking that

26:44.518 --> 26:47.144
the whole world will be finished.

26:48.310 --> 26:50.351
They were so much worried,

26:50.560 --> 26:53.727
they thought that the whole world will be finished.

26:55.185 --> 26:57.144
But did not.

26:57.310 --> 27:01.518
But this war has taught us a lesson.

27:04.310 --> 27:07.518
It has made us more collective.

27:08.102 --> 27:11.144
It has made us understand each other.

27:12.102 --> 27:15.393
Otherwise, how do you come out of the ignorance

27:15.602 --> 27:18.935
that “we are this country”, “we are that country”,

27:19.310 --> 27:21.185
racialism,

27:21.393 --> 27:24.102
then this so-called nationalism,

27:24.268 --> 27:26.351
so-called patriotism -

27:26.560 --> 27:31.019
all these separating forces,

27:32.560 --> 27:34.894
divisive things.

27:35.810 --> 27:40.560
Saw clearly we are all human beings

27:42.060 --> 27:45.643
and we should be treated as human beings.

27:46.310 --> 27:50.019
If you see the history, after every war

27:50.185 --> 27:56.435
there has been a speedy movement towards knowledge,

27:56.768 --> 28:00.184
knowledge of oneness of the world.

28:01.351 --> 28:03.727
It is something

28:05.351 --> 28:09.144
like, you have in a spacecraft

28:09.310 --> 28:13.184
that a container is built in,

28:14.977 --> 28:18.351
one into another,

28:20.060 --> 28:23.935
and the whole thing

28:25.184 --> 28:30.476
comes into a speed, some velocity,

28:31.560 --> 28:35.602
and then the lower container bursts,

28:36.310 --> 28:38.602
or explodes.

28:38.810 --> 28:42.810
When it explodes, it gives a higher speed

28:43.685 --> 28:46.144
to the rest of it.

28:46.643 --> 28:51.685
And so the acceleration of the velocity takes place.

28:52.184 --> 28:56.184
And that’s how one can go into the space.

28:57.768 --> 29:00.602
In the same manner,

29:00.810 --> 29:04.310
all these horrible things that have happened

29:05.019 --> 29:07.935
are explosions

29:08.768 --> 29:11.768
which brings you

29:13.852 --> 29:16.768
towards knowledge

29:17.019 --> 29:18.977
that there’s something wrong with us,

29:19.184 --> 29:22.894
we are living with something unreal.

29:24.435 --> 29:29.226
Now the problems, today’s problems as they are,

29:35.351 --> 29:38.393
like ecology problem,

29:41.685 --> 29:43.184
AIDS,

29:44.268 --> 29:46.102
drugs,

29:47.810 --> 29:52.977
all these modern problems and poverty,

29:54.060 --> 29:57.351
if you see it like a witness, you will see

29:57.560 --> 30:00.268
these are quite shocking.

30:01.393 --> 30:03.810
These are very shocking things.

30:04.019 --> 30:08.518
And all these shocking things should really shock our mind,

30:09.185 --> 30:12.226
should really shock our mind.

30:12.977 --> 30:16.185
Why we have these problems?

30:18.685 --> 30:22.894
And these problems, some of the stupid leaders think

30:23.102 --> 30:26.643
that we can solve by making more money.

30:27.685 --> 30:31.935
We can protect ourselves from ecology if we have more money.

30:32.810 --> 30:36.977
And that we can pollute the atmosphere

30:37.185 --> 30:39.185
because we will have more money.

30:39.393 --> 30:41.977
And then we can protect ourselves

30:42.184 --> 30:44.518
so that everybody will have to have a mask,

30:44.727 --> 30:47.268
moving about all over the place.

30:47.643 --> 30:52.060
But we should make more money to protect ourselves.

30:52.226 --> 30:56.060
Doesn’t matter if there is ecological problem, doesn’t matter.

30:57.019 --> 30:58.768
So you move about

30:58.977 --> 31:01.560
like a person who is entering

31:01.768 --> 31:05.727
into the area which is all full of fumes.

31:08.894 --> 31:11.768
All these stupid ideas come up because

31:11.977 --> 31:13.727
they do not see

31:13.935 --> 31:17.185
that, what is human dignity is,

31:18.310 --> 31:22.351
that human beings are above

31:22.560 --> 31:26.518
everything else - above machinery,

31:26.727 --> 31:30.685
above all material things of the world.

31:31.560 --> 31:35.560
They will not talk, that we'll balance the machinery. No.

31:36.393 --> 31:39.226
What they will talk, that we'll make a man

31:39.435 --> 31:42.102
a greater slave of the machinery

31:42.268 --> 31:44.184
because he must have money.

31:44.351 --> 31:48.019
He must have more money, and with this more money,

31:48.185 --> 31:52.310
we can protect ourselves against this ecological problem.

31:52.643 --> 31:55.102
It is absurd.

31:56.393 --> 32:00.144
But if you understand the human dignity,

32:00.476 --> 32:03.518
then you have to understand that

32:03.727 --> 32:06.727
as a human being,

32:09.435 --> 32:13.810
we have to take a very positive,

32:14.019 --> 32:18.435
wise step to stop all the nonsense we have been doing.

32:23.310 --> 32:25.685
Like, now most of the

32:26.894 --> 32:28.435
French

32:30.102 --> 32:31.435
shores,

32:32.184 --> 32:35.685
the beaches, are polluted.

32:36.184 --> 32:38.185
Naturally.

32:38.852 --> 32:40.351
Because they started a funny thing

32:40.560 --> 32:43.310
called “holiday making on the seashore.”

32:44.268 --> 32:46.060
So this is the result.

32:46.226 --> 32:48.184
Now, do what you please.

32:48.351 --> 32:51.643
You cannot do all that. It has stopped.

32:51.852 --> 32:54.184
So instead of - now human brain is such,

32:54.393 --> 32:57.727
instead of understanding that we have done something wrong,

32:57.935 --> 33:01.185
oh, they will say, “We will start some new method

33:01.393 --> 33:03.810
of cleansing this.”

33:04.019 --> 33:06.560
They will never condemn

33:06.768 --> 33:08.727
what has gone wrong with them

33:08.935 --> 33:12.226
that they have become so addicted to this kind of a

33:12.435 --> 33:16.019
funny life that they have on the seashores.

33:16.560 --> 33:18.435
Now, AIDS.

33:18.643 --> 33:21.685
You’ll be amazed that in America

33:22.226 --> 33:25.435
why, even they said that

33:25.727 --> 33:29.268
there were in Los Angeles, itself,

33:29.602 --> 33:32.894
seven hundred thousand people

33:33.435 --> 33:36.977
who glorified themselves as martyrs of AIDS

33:37.184 --> 33:41.019
because they are achieving such a great goal

33:42.685 --> 33:46.393
of leading a life which is nonsensical,

33:46.727 --> 33:49.894
as if like a big revolution.

33:50.977 --> 33:54.768
And thinking that they are very, very

33:54.977 --> 33:58.351
great revolutionaries, great people,

33:58.643 --> 34:02.060
that they are supporting this AIDS

34:05.019 --> 34:09.393
disease and glorifying it.

34:10.685 --> 34:13.060
Can you believe

34:13.351 --> 34:17.560
that this kind of

34:17.768 --> 34:21.685
assertion will be accepted?

34:23.102 --> 34:25.935
People will laugh at you.

34:26.852 --> 34:29.810
But everything is so money-oriented.

34:30.019 --> 34:31.852
They like to advertise it.

34:32.060 --> 34:34.393
They want to talk about money help.

34:34.602 --> 34:37.643
They want to say that this is happening because

34:39.476 --> 34:41.185
if they had more money,

34:41.393 --> 34:44.768
they would have taken more drugs.

34:45.435 --> 34:48.184
Because they have no money, that’s why they are thieving.

34:48.351 --> 34:51.852
So we must give them money so that they can take drugs,

34:53.268 --> 34:55.977
or they can take to this kind of life.

34:56.184 --> 34:58.727
On the whole, if you see,

34:58.935 --> 35:00.977
people have lived

35:01.184 --> 35:03.935
with something which is so unreal

35:04.144 --> 35:07.144
all their lives, absolutely unreal.

35:07.310 --> 35:10.935
And when it comes to facing it,

35:11.144 --> 35:13.518
that we’ve done a mistake,

35:13.727 --> 35:16.685
we should not have done this mistake;

35:17.560 --> 35:19.602
then they retreat

35:19.810 --> 35:22.894
and take another glorious

35:23.102 --> 35:26.268
image, artificial and unreal,

35:26.476 --> 35:29.935
saying  “Oh, we are great, we are martyrs.”

35:34.977 --> 35:39.768
And this is what is, what we call is Kali Yuga

35:39.977 --> 35:44.852
where everything that is ignoble, everything that is to be detested,

35:45.060 --> 35:49.226
everything from which we should have protection will become

35:49.435 --> 35:53.977
the goal of people to achieve.

35:54.685 --> 35:57.560
I hope you have understood

35:57.768 --> 36:02.144
that the All-Pervading Power around us

36:02.310 --> 36:05.019
is the one that is doing Sahaja Yoga,

36:05.185 --> 36:07.560
is the one that has brought you to Sahaja Yoga,

36:07.768 --> 36:11.184
and is the one who has given you blessings,

36:11.351 --> 36:12.643
is Paramachaitanya.

36:14.810 --> 36:17.560
Through which it has worked out.

36:17.768 --> 36:22.310
So today’s prayer should be that we be more and more aware

36:22.518 --> 36:26.560
that we are part and parcel of that Paramachaitanya

36:26.768 --> 36:29.226
and that we can feel that,

36:29.435 --> 36:33.518
we can use that power, we can work it out.

36:33.727 --> 36:36.476
If it is felt today that way,

36:36.685 --> 36:40.102
I think lot of work has been done already

36:40.268 --> 36:42.102
and may God bless you for that.

37:56.435 --> 37:57.768
Now.

38:00.393 --> 38:04.144
So when you are doing this Puja, please remember

38:04.310 --> 38:07.643
that you are worshipping Me as Paramachaitanya

38:07.852 --> 38:12.019
and so you have to just think

38:12.185 --> 38:15.977
that you’re dealing with reality itself.

38:20.351 --> 38:23.768
With that understanding, you have to do this Puja.

38:30.977 --> 38:33.268
May God bless you.
