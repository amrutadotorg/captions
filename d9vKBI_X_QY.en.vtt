00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:15.179
Kundalini has been described fourteen thousand
years back by a great poet called Markandeya

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.720
in our country.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.490
I told you the other day that in Koran it
is described as “Assas” [foundation] and

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:30.660
in Granth Sahib as “Shruti” [revelation]
and in the Bible as the Holy Ghost.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.110
In the Zen system also, it is described of
the Zen system of Bodhidharma it is described

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.840
and also Lao-Tse has described it.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.960
Every one of them has described it.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:52.059
The power of pure desire, which is the
Kundalini, which is in the triangular bone

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.201
of sacrum, gives us this ascent.

00:00:57.201 --> 00:01:05.477
This is the reflection of the Holy Ghost,
is the power we call as Adi Shakti, the Primordial Mother.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.777
And the reflection of God Almighty is in our
heart, which is the Spirit.

00:01:11.901 --> 00:01:19.281
When the union takes places then we say “Yoga”
has happened means the union, “Yoga” also

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.220
means the union.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.240
Thus, our attention becomes enlightened by
the Spirit.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:34.670
When our attention is enlightened by the Spirit
then we become, I say again we become, it’s

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.200
not a mental projection or anything, but actually
you become collectively conscious.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:54.850
That means you start feeling your inner Self,
your centres, your nadis on your fingertips

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.729
and that of others as well.

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:04.652
So first, when the Kundalini awakens it gives
the first state called Nirvichara Samadhi,

00:02:04.652 --> 00:02:08.567
means the one where you become thoughtlessly
aware.

00:02:08.951 --> 00:02:18.244
Now, this is the energy of pure - again I say -
the pure and the holy desire within us.

00:02:18.244 --> 00:02:20.721
All other desires are impure.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.290
That’s why you must have seen, that according
to economics, the wants, in general, are not

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.500
satiable, in particular, they are.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.777
Because you want to have something say, you
want to have a car, then when you get the car

00:02:35.777 --> 00:02:40.026
you want to have a house, then you get
a house you want to have something else, you

00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:43.820
go on shifting from one desire to another,
to another desire.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.657
Because that desire is not satisfying.

00:02:46.657 --> 00:02:56.476
So, this pure Energy within us of our holy
desire is one that is to be one with the Divine,

00:02:56.476 --> 00:02:59.588
with the All-pervading Power of God.

00:02:59.588 --> 00:03:03.293
And unless and until this Desire is awaken within us

00:03:03.293 --> 00:03:08.240
through the spontaneous happening of the living force

00:03:08.317 --> 00:03:14.244
of the living God, you cannot get your Realization.

00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:19.690
This Kundalini rest in the triangular bone
which is sacrum – meaning sacred 

00:03:19.874 --> 00:03:26.492
– that means the Greek knew that this, this one was a sacred place.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.196
But in the last hundred years, lots of funny
people have come around

00:03:31.317 --> 00:03:36.865
and giving very funny ideas even about Kundalini which is not written anywhere in the Shastras [sacred texts].

00:03:37.078 --> 00:03:42.998
This Kundalini is your individual mother,
and how can she trouble you?

00:03:43.107 --> 00:03:49.056
When your mother, physical mother gave you
birth, she took up all the trouble upon herself.
