WEBVTT

00:01.240 --> 00:06.690
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

00:12.651 --> 00:15.106
At the very outset,

00:15.134 --> 00:20.515
I have to tell you that Truth is what it is.

00:20.553 --> 00:23.001
You cannot change it,

00:23.042 --> 00:25.977
you cannot transform it,

00:25.981 --> 00:28.507
you cannot explain it.

00:28.532 --> 00:31.882
Only thing you can experience it.

00:34.837 --> 00:36.944
In this Kali Yuga

00:37.094 --> 00:41.235
there is a special category of people born

00:41.264 --> 00:44.265
in all the countries very surprisingly,

00:44.304 --> 00:48.030
who are seekers of Truth.

00:48.045 --> 00:55.006
And William Blake, the great poet of England

00:55.076 --> 00:57.326
has said that

00:58.665 --> 01:03.479
these men of God will be born during this time

01:03.530 --> 01:06.739
and they will know the truth

01:06.780 --> 01:09.010
So many have said about this.

01:09.037 --> 01:14.197
Even in our old books of prophecies.

01:16.706 --> 01:19.186
You have known so many of them

01:19.266 --> 01:23.034
but especially the one which is described

01:23.105 --> 01:26.599
in Nadi Granth written by Bhrigu Muni

01:26.680 --> 01:29.569
is clearly said that at this time

01:29.620 --> 01:34.474
people will know the Truth through the Kundalini Awakening.

01:34.495 --> 01:37.475
The knowledge of Kundalini was known to us,

01:37.525 --> 01:41.006
I don’t know how many years back.

01:41.096 --> 01:45.739
You cannot say because our history is so unknown.

01:45.795 --> 01:51.530
But at the time of a great saint

01:51.543 --> 01:54.981
called as Macchindra Nath and Gorakh Nath,

01:55.000 --> 01:59.292
they were indulging into

01:59.341 --> 02:02.408
awakening of Kundalini

02:02.457 --> 02:07.832
but the condition was that one Guru should give Realisation to only one person.

02:07.843 --> 02:09.953
Went on like this

02:09.962 --> 02:12.342
till the twelfth century when

02:12.350 --> 02:14.943
Gyandeva first of all asked his Guru,

02:14.950 --> 02:18.272
his own Master was his own brother.

02:18.270 --> 02:19.312
asked him that,

02:19.319 --> 02:24.461
“You please allow me to at least write about Kundalini.”

02:24.500 --> 02:29.548
Because in the Gita it was not described.

02:29.574 --> 02:33.138
Though Shri Krishna has talked of Sthit Pragnya and all those things

02:33.163 --> 02:36.704
but he didn’t talk about:

02:36.717 --> 02:37.723
How to get it?

02:37.752 --> 02:42.021
What is the mechanism within us which works it out?

02:42.081 --> 02:46.812
Then he wrote it in his Gyaneshwari

02:46.860 --> 02:49.610
which is just a, I think,

02:49.669 --> 02:52.389
explanation of Gita very clearly

02:52.460 --> 02:54.893
that there is a power within us.

02:54.894 --> 02:57.763
In the sixth chapter he wrote about Kundalini

02:57.644 --> 03:01.902
but the people who were in charge of religion didn’t want that.

03:01.927 --> 03:04.587
So they said, “This is a Nishiddha (prohibited) part

03:04.647 --> 03:07.949
and you should not read this part of Kundalini.”

03:07.957 --> 03:10.218
But in the sixteenth century

03:10.237 --> 03:13.045
under the guidance of Guru Nanaka,

03:13.086 --> 03:14.086
Namdeva,

03:14.116 --> 03:15.479
Kabira,

03:15.496 --> 03:21.981
all these people, clearly, clearly, very clearly wrote about Kundalini

03:22.027 --> 03:26.281
but the way it was mutilated

03:26.298 --> 03:29.344
by

03:29.365 --> 03:31.907
people which is very surprising.

03:31.925 --> 03:33.737
Everything has been mutilated

03:33.758 --> 03:36.481
but this one was very surprising

03:36.512 --> 03:40.411
because Kabira was in Bihar

03:40.420 --> 03:42.711
and he called Kundalini as Surti.

03:42.730 --> 03:45.311
Very clearly, he said about Surti

03:45.320 --> 03:51.260
but in Bihar, ‘Surti’ is what you call ‘tobacco’.

03:51.282 --> 03:53.040
They call ‘tobacco’ as ‘Surti’,

03:53.043 --> 03:56.116
so you can imagine what is the mutilation.

03:56.122 --> 03:59.313
Now this power is within you.

03:59.362 --> 04:01.213
If I am telling you something today

04:01.234 --> 04:03.014
you need not accept it.

04:03.054 --> 04:05.633
Blind folded acceptance is of no use.

04:05.663 --> 04:09.060
We have had enough problems with blind faiths.

04:09.074 --> 04:11.026
So, first of all

04:11.027 --> 04:12.596
you must get the experience

04:12.608 --> 04:16.430
and then you will not doubt it.

04:16.427 --> 04:20.274
This science was known to us since long

04:20.314 --> 04:22.634
but as it was only done for one person

04:22.663 --> 04:25.884
or say ten persons at the most,

04:25.894 --> 04:28.744
I decided to find out a method by which

04:28.774 --> 04:32.644
an en-masse Realisation could be given.

04:32.665 --> 04:35.536
Luckily my father was a very social person

04:35.615 --> 04:38.235
and I could meet many people.

04:38.286 --> 04:42.579
Even my husband’s life was such that I could meet many people.

04:42.629 --> 04:49.230
So, I worked out the permutations and combinations of human problems

04:49.281 --> 04:51.095
and then I discovered

04:51.141 --> 04:53.814
how we can easily solve this problem

04:53.831 --> 04:55.954
of Kundalini awakening.

04:55.942 --> 04:58.324
Because there are problems

04:58.362 --> 05:00.475
on the way of its ascent

05:00.517 --> 05:04.197
then Kundalini doesn’t, Kundalini doesn’t come up.

05:04.237 --> 05:05.766
Now

05:05.815 --> 05:08.255
there are seven chakras

05:08.317 --> 05:11.125
basically within us.

05:11.168 --> 05:14.252
These seven chakras are responsible

05:14.314 --> 05:18.910
of our physical, mental and emotional being.

05:18.923 --> 05:20.610
There is no doubt about it

05:20.624 --> 05:22.954
but you have to first find out

05:22.947 --> 05:24.040
and then believe in it.

05:24.060 --> 05:26.240
Don’t believe because I am saying so

05:26.261 --> 05:30.543
or anybody says so. You have to experience it and feel it.

05:30.550 --> 05:32.853
There are many ways we can also judge.

05:32.860 --> 05:35.353
For example,

05:35.374 --> 05:36.903
in the Koran,

05:36.913 --> 05:41.853
Mohammed Sahib has said, “At the time of Kayama, means this time of Resurrection,

05:41.894 --> 05:43.754
your hands will speak.”

05:43.793 --> 05:45.713
He also calls it ‘Kayamat’

05:45.757 --> 05:48.767
means ‘those who will not accept will suffer’.

05:48.788 --> 05:51.208
But who will accept their hands will speak,

05:51.228 --> 05:52.499
their

05:52.559 --> 05:55.199
mouth will be shut and their hands will speak?

05:55.269 --> 05:57.459
This is exactly what happens in Sahaja Yoga

05:57.538 --> 06:00.497
that once you get your Self-realisation

06:00.543 --> 06:03.947
you can feel those subtle centres within you.

06:03.983 --> 06:06.100
These subtle centres of energy

06:06.129 --> 06:07.819
are seven in number

06:07.843 --> 06:15.754
and are acting for giving us all kinds of energies.

06:15.803 --> 06:18.670
Now the problem is how to make

06:18.684 --> 06:20.540
people believe in Kundalini.

06:20.553 --> 06:22.440
It’s a difficult task

06:22.442 --> 06:24.331
because you are all intellectuals

06:24.343 --> 06:28.071
and you have had your medical education

06:28.083 --> 06:30.983
from England and all these places you see.

06:30.992 --> 06:32.713
It is more westernised

06:32.726 --> 06:34.988
and to believe in something Indian

06:35.026 --> 06:38.829
is rather difficult for people that it’s all Indian after all.

06:38.867 --> 06:41.976
But actually, even in medical science

06:42.047 --> 06:45.177
we have to understand the limitations of a science.

06:45.206 --> 06:48.187
First of all, science is amoral.

06:50.596 --> 06:53.838
Secondly, it does not go to the roots.

06:53.843 --> 06:58.208
So, it starts like we have to treat a tree.

06:58.213 --> 06:59.858
So, we treat the leaves,

06:59.874 --> 07:01.269
treat the branches

07:01.319 --> 07:03.608
but Sahaja Yoga is going to the roots,

07:03.649 --> 07:05.326
is the knowledge of the roots.

07:05.350 --> 07:09.230
And the roots are the seven chakras and our Kundalini.

07:09.279 --> 07:12.651
Of course, without medical science you cannot also understand Sahaja Yoga.

07:12.672 --> 07:18.805
That is also one of the things because you can relate very easily. It is very scientific.

07:18.821 --> 07:21.581
Now there are three Nadis also

07:21.632 --> 07:24.310
Left, Right and Centre.

07:24.331 --> 07:27.139
Left is called as Ida Nadi,

07:27.220 --> 07:28.939
right as Pingala

07:29.019 --> 07:36.050
and the central one is called as Sushumna Nadi.

07:38.982 --> 07:41.572
Kabira has described it very clearly

07:41.632 --> 07:44.518
and it is in the Granth Sahib

07:44.538 --> 07:48.088
written down but nobody tries to understand

07:48.129 --> 07:49.648
or to go beyond the words.

07:49.668 --> 07:52.818
Just go and read the words that is not going to help.

07:52.838 --> 07:54.248
You have to go beyond it.

07:54.250 --> 07:59.348
It is like this, you see a beautiful picture say where it’s raining,

07:59.379 --> 08:04.008
it’s very beautiful and you are seeing it, that’s all.

08:04.026 --> 08:07.514
But you are not inside it to experience it.

08:07.584 --> 08:10.134
So, to enter inside was difficult one

08:10.204 --> 08:13.716
because of the tradition of giving to one person only,

08:13.745 --> 08:15.194
or to few persons

08:15.204 --> 08:17.266
and secondly the greatest objection

08:17.276 --> 08:21.026
came from people, who were in charge of religion

08:21.045 --> 08:22.545
so called

08:22.570 --> 08:24.560
Nowadays those who are intellectuals,

08:24.581 --> 08:30.802
you should say medias and other people

08:30.831 --> 08:33.939
who have a feeling that they know everything,

08:33.948 --> 08:37.605
they don’t want to take anything, that is to begin with.

08:37.629 --> 08:39.706
This is one of the reasons why

08:39.721 --> 08:44.864
people don’t turn their eyes to the great knowledge we have in this country

08:44.881 --> 08:49.134
I am so very happy today that

08:49.152 --> 08:51.804
Indian Medical Association

08:51.831 --> 08:54.438
has given me this honour first of all

08:54.471 --> 08:57.783
because I could never imagine in my lifetime,

08:57.801 --> 08:59.858
I would be able to talk with you.

08:59.888 --> 09:04.342
I also did my medicine and I knew how difficult it was

09:04.375 --> 09:06.326
and how people were blind.

09:06.395 --> 09:09.722
So, I used to think, “How will I explain to them”,

09:09.763 --> 09:11.047
like Kabira has said,

09:11.046 --> 09:16.287
“Kaise samjhau, sab jag andha” (How to make them understand when the whole world is blind?)

09:16.311 --> 09:18.947
But the time has come because there are seekers now.

09:18.971 --> 09:21.116
And they should also know one more thing,

09:21.130 --> 09:23.557
that this country is the Yogabhoomi.

09:23.591 --> 09:25.596
They have given us science all right

09:25.633 --> 09:27.003
but we will give them Yoga.

09:27.052 --> 09:33.028
We will give them the real basic knowledge

09:33.058 --> 09:38.127
what is the foundation of Medical Science,

09:38.134 --> 09:40.154
is the foundation!

09:40.174 --> 09:44.354
Now by experimenting this and that

09:44.354 --> 09:47.831
also you have seen that it is neutralised by challenges.

09:47.846 --> 09:49.874
Every theory is neutralised

09:49.884 --> 09:52.519
so that means it is not Absolute.

09:52.546 --> 09:56.558
So, we have to go to something that is absolutely Absolute

09:56.596 --> 09:59.556
You have seen that Einstein found out something

09:59.605 --> 10:01.359
then our people are after him

10:01.385 --> 10:04.378
this is wrong, that is wrong, going on like that.

10:04.405 --> 10:07.848
All the time something comes up, people go on criticising

10:07.855 --> 10:12.460
and the whole knowledge goes into oblivion.

10:12.495 --> 10:16.481
So now we have to understand that if this is the Yogabhoomi,

10:16.529 --> 10:18.361
this is our country

10:18.381 --> 10:21.163
and if it has given us such a knowledge,

10:21.190 --> 10:24.461
why should we not also listen to it,

10:24.470 --> 10:29.966
because not only that it will flower your knowledge of medicine,

10:29.990 --> 10:36.731
not only that but it will give you such a confidence while practicing,

10:36.730 --> 10:39.507
while talking about medicine.

10:39.518 --> 10:42.717
Now as it is a subject,

10:42.738 --> 10:44.327
is on medicine

10:44.347 --> 10:47.341
I would like to speak on one of the centres

10:47.371 --> 10:52.018
which is very important because doctors are always affected by that centre.

10:52.034 --> 10:56.068
So, I better tell them what can go wrong with doctors

10:56.094 --> 10:58.394
and what they should be careful about.

11:05.969 --> 11:10.239
It is to be understood that there is a centre,

11:10.288 --> 11:14.799
is the second centre which we call as Swadishthan.

11:14.813 --> 11:16.739
This centre is very interesting.

11:16.774 --> 11:20.659
It comes out of the Solar Plexus

11:20.693 --> 11:24.750
we call it a Nabhi Chakra

11:24.764 --> 11:28.140
and like a lotus and it moves all round you see,

11:28.153 --> 11:32.020
as you can say in gross way it is Aortic Plexus.

11:32.043 --> 11:34.222
It supplies energy to Aortic Plexus.

11:34.254 --> 11:38.710
It is not Aortic Plexus but supplies energy to Aortic Plexus.

11:38.721 --> 11:43.461
Now this centre is very important

11:43.501 --> 11:46.322
because it gives energy to our liver,

11:46.371 --> 11:49.313
to pancreas,

11:49.341 --> 11:52.883
to our spleen, to our intestines,

11:52.898 --> 11:54.043
to our kidneys,

11:54.048 --> 11:57.158
can you imagine such an important centre it is!

11:57.145 --> 11:58.346
This Swadishthan!

11:58.360 --> 12:01.456
But the most important work it does is very...

12:01.480 --> 12:03.806
which I don’t know you will accept or not

12:03.840 --> 12:07.880
but it supplies energy to our grey cells

12:07.895 --> 12:11.150
which we are using all the time.

12:11.135 --> 12:13.118
When we are thinking too much,

12:13.125 --> 12:16.588
when we are acting physically and mentally,

12:16.615 --> 12:21.762
this centre has to supply energy to our brain,

12:21.755 --> 12:25.312
we can call it to our grey cells

12:25.336 --> 12:28.972
which we are using all the time.

12:29.005 --> 12:30.312
When we are doctors,

12:30.340 --> 12:32.620
we are using our grey cells how much?

12:32.633 --> 12:33.353
We have no idea.

12:33.360 --> 12:36.076
There is nobody who has found out

12:36.110 --> 12:37.879
how much we use our brains,

12:37.950 --> 12:42.912
but we are going exhausting our brains and also, we are very futuristic.

12:42.914 --> 12:45.082
All doctors are futuristic.

12:45.105 --> 12:49.826
Maybe they want to find out something

12:49.886 --> 12:51.947
in the pure sense of the word

12:51.964 --> 12:54.557
or maybe they have certain ideas

12:54.578 --> 12:56.364
or maybe it is money,

12:56.375 --> 12:59.384
may be anything but they are very, very futuristic

12:59.395 --> 13:03.057
and in that trend of futuristic behaviour also

13:03.086 --> 13:04.922
there is a big competition

13:04.936 --> 13:06.642
so they don’t know what to do.

13:06.668 --> 13:10.212
They have to be futuristic and think but what will happen.

13:10.222 --> 13:17.691
Now in this kind of movement of the mind

13:17.706 --> 13:18.504
what happens

13:18.534 --> 13:21.093
we start becoming very right sided,

13:21.091 --> 13:22.683
extremely right sided.

13:22.711 --> 13:24.483
Now as a result of that,

13:24.489 --> 13:26.739
as a right sided man, you know

13:26.759 --> 13:29.028
I would say what medically can happen,

13:29.048 --> 13:32.753
of course also happens lot of things mentally also.

13:32.768 --> 13:37.399
But what can happen medically,

13:37.408 --> 13:39.369
this Swadishthan Chakra

13:39.418 --> 13:41.458
which has to supply to your liver.

13:41.469 --> 13:43.168
Why do you call it ‘liver’?

13:43.188 --> 13:44.999
Because of liver we live.

13:44.999 --> 13:49.120
Liver is very important in Sahaja Yoga.

13:49.166 --> 13:52.360
I know that in medicine we don’t know much about liver

13:52.365 --> 13:56.919
and it is absolutely curable in Sahaja Yoga.

13:56.926 --> 13:58.360
But now what happens,

13:58.389 --> 14:03.828
liver is the one which takes all the poison of the body

14:03.846 --> 14:08.385
and throws it into the circulation.

14:08.399 --> 14:10.938
That everyone knows, all right!

14:10.946 --> 14:15.466
Now when liver is looked after it is normal,

14:15.475 --> 14:17.645
then we have also a pancreas,

14:17.676 --> 14:20.306
then we have spleen

14:20.355 --> 14:22.375
and also kidneys

14:22.410 --> 14:25.586
and the last part of intestines,

14:25.635 --> 14:28.951
intestines as a whole but the last part is very important.

14:28.972 --> 14:31.732
So, such a man who is always thinking

14:31.783 --> 14:35.011
all his energy is going to his brain

14:35.023 --> 14:37.403
and all these organs are neglected

14:37.472 --> 14:40.857
and he can be affected by any one of them

14:40.860 --> 14:44.717
So, the first thing he is affected is bad liver.

14:44.740 --> 14:46.523
Now this bad liver

14:46.538 --> 14:50.692
because it cannot throw its heat,

14:50.717 --> 14:52.741
which is the poison of the body

14:52.751 --> 14:54.052
into the circulation.

14:54.101 --> 14:57.251
What happens that it starts, heat starts rising,

14:57.282 --> 15:00.782
this heat goes higher on the right side.

15:00.841 --> 15:02.512
We call it Right Heart

15:02.491 --> 15:05.972
which is the centre which controls the lungs.

15:05.952 --> 15:08.912
So, such a person can get Asthma.

15:08.929 --> 15:11.622
Now Asthma has been cured through Sahaja Yoga,

15:11.649 --> 15:13.212
very simple way.

15:13.283 --> 15:14.819
But it can be cured,

15:14.832 --> 15:20.409
it gets Asthma. We say it is incurable because we don't know about Swadishthan.

15:20.432 --> 15:24.179
Now this same thing happens to our…

15:24.250 --> 15:27.211
when it moves to the left side pancreas.

15:27.240 --> 15:29.641
Mostly people who are sitting on their chairs

15:29.678 --> 15:32.198
and thinking too much and planning too much

15:32.206 --> 15:33.678
get diabetes.

15:38.399 --> 15:41.139
Sugar doesn’t give you diabetes.

15:41.153 --> 15:44.844
In Maharashtra, I don’t know maybe here also in the villages,

15:44.864 --> 15:48.429
a villager will take sugar

15:48.439 --> 15:51.699
in such a way that the spoon must stand at the right angles

15:51.724 --> 15:54.139
That’s the way

15:54.169 --> 15:56.503
a tea has to be made otherwise it is not tea,

15:56.523 --> 15:58.063
but he never gets diabetes,

15:58.038 --> 16:03.652
because he earns without any insurance or anything, spends it sleeps off.

16:03.669 --> 16:05.032
Next day he earns.

16:05.044 --> 16:07.211
He does not have botheration about future.

16:07.235 --> 16:08.335
What he should do?

16:08.394 --> 16:09.840
He should accumulate money

16:09.879 --> 16:12.611
or he should give it to somebody? Nothing.

16:12.611 --> 16:15.566
He just lives with himself.

16:15.580 --> 16:18.846
Now this goes to pancreas,

16:18.876 --> 16:20.456
gives you diabetes,

16:20.466 --> 16:21.285
this heat

16:21.326 --> 16:23.147
Then it goes down

16:23.166 --> 16:26.807
then the kidney, kidney it coagulates.

16:26.817 --> 16:29.027
Now for kidney if you go to dialysis,

16:29.047 --> 16:30.147
I must tell you

16:30.157 --> 16:31.465
not that only you die

16:31.476 --> 16:35.777
but you die bankrupt it is a fact.

16:35.797 --> 16:39.812
Now in no way I want to criticise doctors,

16:39.863 --> 16:41.783
they have to earn after all,

16:41.793 --> 16:43.613
but there is a simple way

16:43.633 --> 16:46.413
of curing this kidney trouble

16:46.393 --> 16:48.293
And once this kidney is cured,

16:48.283 --> 16:50.758
it is cured forever

16:50.765 --> 16:53.479
So, by helping Swadishthan

16:53.485 --> 16:56.895
you can cure also kidney.

16:56.895 --> 16:59.109
But the most difficult thing

16:59.125 --> 17:00.696
is the spleen.

17:00.735 --> 17:04.196
Now in modern times

17:04.237 --> 17:06.053
we are very hectic

17:06.067 --> 17:06.863
For example,

17:06.886 --> 17:10.212
most of the doctors have to get up early in the morning

17:10.232 --> 17:11.732
on duty.

17:11.767 --> 17:14.604
In college we also used to do the same thing.

17:14.606 --> 17:15.624
Then we have no time

17:15.656 --> 17:17.770
to eat our food properly nothing.

17:17.790 --> 17:20.203
And we take our breakfast with us sometimes.

17:20.237 --> 17:21.115
In America

17:21.134 --> 17:23.535
I have seen doctors even brushing their teeth

17:23.555 --> 17:25.831
in the car.

17:25.845 --> 17:27.644
It is the limit of things.

17:27.644 --> 17:30.943
So, in this kind of a hectic life

17:31.003 --> 17:32.163
what happens:

17:32.183 --> 17:33.273
the spleen, poor thing

17:33.314 --> 17:36.894
which has to produce RBCs for emergencies

17:36.913 --> 17:38.031
gets mad.

17:38.053 --> 17:39.903
She can’t understand,

17:39.902 --> 17:42.112
“What is the matter with this gentleman?”

17:42.162 --> 17:47.580
and it cannot also a sort of cooperate

17:47.624 --> 17:49.773
with all the madness we have.

17:49.804 --> 17:51.288
Then we read newspapers.

17:51.304 --> 17:53.617
Reading newspapers in the morning

17:53.644 --> 17:55.387
is a very dangerous thing

17:55.413 --> 17:57.835
because every day you see something horrible

17:57.859 --> 17:59.305
and you get such a fright.

17:59.325 --> 18:02.256
For example, these days our country is in doldrums.

18:02.296 --> 18:03.500
I never read it in the morning

18:03.549 --> 18:04.816
at any cost

18:04.839 --> 18:07.289
But if you read it early in the morning any newspaper

18:07.380 --> 18:09.333
then finished, you will get some…

18:09.355 --> 18:13.036
They only tell you about what has gone wrong;

18:13.056 --> 18:15.306
disasters, accidents,

18:15.365 --> 18:17.810
if not that then political crisis,

18:17.826 --> 18:20.559
this that which upsets you.

18:20.596 --> 18:22.450
Whether you like it or not

18:22.483 --> 18:24.420
but it upsets you.

18:24.445 --> 18:27.859
So, reading newspaper early in the morning,

18:27.875 --> 18:32.392
then just running forward.

18:32.402 --> 18:33.642
No time for wife,

18:33.711 --> 18:35.862
no time for children, nothing.

18:35.902 --> 18:39.792
Formerly I remember that husband used to eat nicely

18:39.811 --> 18:41.053
at about ten o’clock.

18:41.056 --> 18:42.875
The wife used to fan him

18:42.945 --> 18:47.536
because there might be some flies around.

18:47.536 --> 18:49.817
She used to fan

18:49.836 --> 18:55.577
and relaxed way they used to eat food and live relaxed.

18:55.597 --> 18:58.968
Now what you call in Urdu language

18:58.988 --> 19:01.488
‘Kashmakash’ (Mental Struggle) is so much,

19:01.498 --> 19:03.678
that people are just running mad.

19:03.755 --> 19:05.384
They don’t know what to do.

19:05.454 --> 19:06.615
Now they go to the office,

19:06.615 --> 19:08.704
then they find, doctors especially,

19:08.704 --> 19:10.259
the boss is angry

19:10.309 --> 19:12.923
or there is some very serious patient has come,

19:12.930 --> 19:15.039
somebody has died by mistake.

19:15.099 --> 19:19.089
I mean doctors are completely treated

19:19.109 --> 19:20.700
like criminals in America,

19:20.750 --> 19:22.539
absolutely like criminals.

19:22.599 --> 19:24.680
So, this is also coming here.

19:24.693 --> 19:26.513
If they do anything wrong by mistake,

19:26.574 --> 19:29.574
they do something, finished.

19:29.604 --> 19:30.909
Their practice is gone,

19:30.943 --> 19:33.189
they are put in jail.

19:33.203 --> 19:35.951
I mean after all they're human beings

19:35.971 --> 19:38.182
but this consideration is not there

19:38.192 --> 19:43.321
And so, this futuristic life makes them really crazy people.

19:43.372 --> 19:44.922
Then they become very hot tempered.

19:44.932 --> 19:45.957
Liver gives you heat,

19:45.982 --> 19:48.762
you become very hot tempered at the slightest thing,

19:48.792 --> 19:50.137
you just shoot off

19:50.153 --> 19:52.971
and start saying things which you should never have said.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.571
Then you feel guilty.

19:54.587 --> 19:57.958
When you feel guilty you catch this centre here,

19:57.968 --> 19:59.347
left Vishuddhi we call it

19:59.397 --> 20:01.758
by which you develop spondylitis.

20:01.827 --> 20:03.244
If not spondylitis,

20:03.278 --> 20:06.184
there is something horrible thing can happen to you.

20:06.210 --> 20:08.505
Now according to Sahaja Yoga,

20:08.539 --> 20:10.755
we have two types of heart attacks.

20:10.779 --> 20:13.801
One is an active massive heart attack

20:13.839 --> 20:17.553
and another one is what you call lethargic

20:17.586 --> 20:19.386
like angina.

20:19.403 --> 20:23.977
So, the first one which happens

20:23.972 --> 20:25.517
is the massive one

20:25.522 --> 20:29.068
where same thing the heat reaches the heart.

20:29.077 --> 20:30.588
Now say there is a boy

20:30.597 --> 20:32.538
who is playing tennis

20:32.557 --> 20:34.558
at the age of twenty-one or twenty-two

20:34.597 --> 20:37.941
and is drinking also, competing with his father.

20:37.978 --> 20:41.281
So, he gets that massive heart attack

20:41.306 --> 20:43.471
and it is absolutely fatal.

20:43.551 --> 20:45.922
He cannot live after that.

20:45.981 --> 20:48.718
This is a very common case you must have also seen.

20:48.767 --> 20:51.674
I am not telling you something out of the blue.

20:51.688 --> 20:53.894
But the another one is

20:53.916 --> 20:56.826
if you continue with this kind of thing

20:56.837 --> 21:01.295
then maybe one day you might get massive heart attacks

21:01.326 --> 21:03.105
especially the industrialists.

21:03.146 --> 21:06.065
Industrialists are so much futuristic,

21:06.076 --> 21:07.557
so much calculating

21:07.606 --> 21:13.986
that they don’t calculate that this will entail

21:14.000 --> 21:16.471
their own heart trouble

21:16.530 --> 21:20.439
So, this heart suddenly collapses and they die.

21:20.441 --> 21:24.298
This is a, we call it an active heart attack

21:24.363 --> 21:26.002
due to over acting.

21:26.073 --> 21:28.212
Another one is lethargic heart attack

21:28.272 --> 21:29.482
like angina,

21:29.553 --> 21:33.682
that is if this centre is caught here, if you feel guilty.

21:33.712 --> 21:37.413
Some people are very sensitive and very formal type

21:37.472 --> 21:38.785
you know, they feel guilty,

21:38.803 --> 21:40.385
“I should have done this.”

21:40.403 --> 21:41.545
I have known people

21:41.563 --> 21:43.063
who have been crying all their life,

21:43.083 --> 21:46.290
“I spilled coffee on the table of such and such.”

21:46.288 --> 21:49.115
I say, “Let it be, now gone finished. Why are you bothered?”

21:49.111 --> 21:50.645
But they’ll go on and on and on.

21:50.641 --> 21:52.941
It’s a habit they have formed

21:52.990 --> 21:54.911
to feel guilty about this.

21:54.961 --> 21:57.591
So, about anything they start feeling guilty.

21:57.611 --> 22:01.733
In India we are not so much I think formal type

22:01.824 --> 22:03.171
of people, thank God.

22:03.213 --> 22:05.374
So, I find less cases of this

22:05.423 --> 22:09.391
but still there are many people who develop this left side.

22:09.421 --> 22:13.539
Not only with that you develop your spondylitis,

22:13.568 --> 22:17.869
but you develop a situation

22:17.880 --> 22:22.731
where heart cannot pump blood for your brain,

22:22.741 --> 22:25.463
that is angina.

22:25.501 --> 22:29.031
Nobody knows that it comes from this left side problem;

22:29.031 --> 22:31.672
Left side problems come from other things also,

22:31.711 --> 22:35.183
but one of them is feeling guilty.

22:35.200 --> 22:37.145
This is something I am telling you which

22:37.170 --> 22:40.244
is not yet told in medical science.

22:40.259 --> 22:43.296
But I am sure one day we will have it from India.

22:43.323 --> 22:44.483
We will tell these people

22:44.534 --> 22:49.273
what we know about the roots of trouble.

22:49.294 --> 22:51.778
The root of trouble is like that.

22:51.794 --> 22:54.877
So now the last but not the least

22:54.903 --> 22:57.288
is the effect of Swadishthan

22:57.304 --> 23:00.084
is this heat reaches the brain

23:00.134 --> 23:02.884
and gives you paralysis on the left hand side

23:02.884 --> 23:05.544
because you know it crosses over nerves.

23:05.574 --> 23:08.374
So, it gives you a terrible paralysis

23:08.354 --> 23:11.153
on the left-hand side but you feel it on the right-hand side.

23:11.163 --> 23:14.903
Also, nature is the one which tries to stop it.

23:14.923 --> 23:17.963
If you don’t stop, it says, “All right, I will stop your right side.”

23:17.960 --> 23:20.823
Left side will be all right.

23:20.829 --> 23:25.334
Now the one side of life is also right side.

23:25.314 --> 23:29.317
Second side, another side we can say

23:29.294 --> 23:31.203
is the side which is left side.

23:31.263 --> 23:33.523
And the left side and right side when they meet,

23:33.584 --> 23:36.513
you get psychosomatic trouble.

23:36.523 --> 23:39.394
With this Kundalini rising what happens

23:39.384 --> 23:42.013
that it nourishes those centres.

23:42.034 --> 23:44.503
For example, see this is one centre formed

23:44.544 --> 23:46.183
by two left and right side.

23:46.183 --> 23:49.027
This is a centre; left and right side.

23:49.035 --> 23:51.596
Now the Kundalini passes through this.

23:51.625 --> 23:54.866
But supposing you are using right side too much like this

23:54.884 --> 23:56.926
and suddenly left side breaks sometimes

23:56.934 --> 23:58.733
then what happens

23:58.785 --> 24:04.922
that your connection with the main,

24:04.951 --> 24:07.038
you should say

24:07.061 --> 24:08.628
mains is lost.

24:08.662 --> 24:12.509
You are on your own and cancer starts.

24:12.531 --> 24:14.739
Now this cancer can be cured also;

24:14.761 --> 24:16.902
I am sorry to say but it is a fact.

24:16.917 --> 24:17.927
It can be cured.

24:17.942 --> 24:20.847
Cancer can be cured,

24:20.867 --> 24:24.530
not at a galloping stage I think but at an early stage.

24:24.549 --> 24:28.603
We have also tried some galloping stage people.

24:28.623 --> 24:29.863
They have improved

24:29.883 --> 24:33.044
but still I would say it is not guaranteed at that stage.

24:33.058 --> 24:35.429
After all nothing is guaranteed

24:35.499 --> 24:39.090
but still it works and it has worked.

24:39.128 --> 24:42.923
Now when this cancer is caused

24:42.943 --> 24:44.753
you see, what is our job

24:44.780 --> 24:47.193
is to push back this left side with the right

24:47.191 --> 24:50.576
and also through Kundalini awakening to nourish,

24:50.596 --> 24:51.796
nourish the centre

24:51.865 --> 24:55.335
You see this is the basis for our health

24:55.345 --> 24:59.935
our... you can say... mind,

24:59.986 --> 25:03.461
everything it’s a mental, physical and emotional

25:03.551 --> 25:05.382
but also spiritual

25:05.442 --> 25:08.505
because when Kundalini rises like this;

25:08.531 --> 25:13.659
it goes crosses over this fontanelle bone area.

25:13.679 --> 25:16.328
This is Kabira has said,

25:16.388 --> 25:18.538
“Shunya shikhar par anahat baje re.”

25:18.619 --> 25:21.790
Nobody can explain what does he say.

25:21.808 --> 25:23.391
“Shunya shikhar par anahat,”

25:23.413 --> 25:24.270
is the heartbeat.

25:24.292 --> 25:29.153
How can a heartbeat come up? ‘Shunya shikhar’ means ‘on the fontanelle bone area’

25:29.223 --> 25:30.243
He was not mad

25:30.292 --> 25:33.563
but the people who do not understand

25:33.633 --> 25:38.313
cannot think that this Kundalini reaches here. It does.

25:38.343 --> 25:39.863
You can see for yourself;

25:39.893 --> 25:41.413
it does reach here

25:41.462 --> 25:45.960
and once it breaks, this sound is finished

25:45.982 --> 25:47.260
Then on your nerves,

25:47.290 --> 25:50.056
you are amazed on your central nervous system

25:50.115 --> 25:52.435
you start feeling the cool breeze

25:52.496 --> 25:55.961
of the Holy Ghost as they call it in the Bible

25:55.996 --> 26:00.057
or they call it as the Alakh Niranjan

26:00.111 --> 26:02.371
or they call it as Brahma Chaitanya.

26:02.386 --> 26:05.287
You start feeling it on your fingertips,

26:05.307 --> 26:07.471
on your hands, you can.

26:07.497 --> 26:11.780
If you experience that, still you go on saying, “No, no, no. I do not believe in anything.”

26:11.830 --> 26:12.911
It’s all right.

26:12.971 --> 26:15.681
But if you really start moving into that line

26:15.730 --> 26:17.942
and start feeling that,

26:17.961 --> 26:19.712
then you are amazed

26:19.741 --> 26:23.603
because when the Kundalini rises as I told you,

26:23.632 --> 26:25.041
She helps you physically.

26:25.051 --> 26:28.493
I have told you about only one chakra but there are seven chakras.

26:28.511 --> 26:30.323
So, all these seven chakras,

26:30.373 --> 26:34.473
they give permutation, combination of these three channels.

26:34.482 --> 26:36.094
It cures all.

26:36.093 --> 26:42.486
As a result, you start enjoying your life.

26:42.502 --> 26:43.101
You become

26:43.115 --> 26:46.661
what you call a person who is a witness to this whole thing.

26:46.701 --> 26:48.770
The whole thing becomes just a drama

26:48.790 --> 26:50.942
and you start living,

26:50.961 --> 26:53.332
seeing it so clearly.

26:53.332 --> 26:55.838
This is first thing happens to you.

26:55.878 --> 26:59.020
Now if you have something serious

26:59.038 --> 27:01.717
or say something you have to operate somewhere

27:01.729 --> 27:03.767
then you are nervous already,

27:03.778 --> 27:04.640
“How can I do it?”

27:04.680 --> 27:07.108
If you are nervous, then how can you operate?

27:07.170 --> 27:09.866
And also because of specialisation

27:09.886 --> 27:11.815
you can only do one part.

27:11.858 --> 27:14.124
I have known people, surgeons also,

27:14.134 --> 27:16.825
who have opened the body they said, “No this is not my job.

27:16.855 --> 27:19.903
This is the job of that doctor.”

27:19.944 --> 27:23.025
So, you know the complete knowledge

27:23.035 --> 27:24.881
of medical science, complete!

27:24.904 --> 27:26.560
It’s not only surgery,

27:26.567 --> 27:30.858
it’s not only what you call medicine and others;

27:30.858 --> 27:32.942
we have learnt so many.

27:32.951 --> 27:35.651
So, all that becomes a totality.

27:35.680 --> 27:37.105
In totality you know

27:37.111 --> 27:40.141
what is wrong with it on your fingertips.

27:40.156 --> 27:45.336
For diagnosis, you know a patient dies after it

27:45.349 --> 27:47.422
If somebody goes to say

27:47.450 --> 27:50.843
“Houston” for diagnosis,

27:50.848 --> 27:52.132
you should insure him

27:52.138 --> 27:54.771
because maybe he might die with diagnosis only.

27:54.788 --> 27:55.853
It’s like this,

27:55.878 --> 27:58.333
here diagnosis is only on fingertips.

27:58.358 --> 28:00.467
On the fingertips you can feel very easily

28:00.463 --> 28:02.616
what is the central catch.

28:02.604 --> 28:03.757
Now if you learn

28:03.743 --> 28:04.646
or if you know

28:04.644 --> 28:06.987
what are these centres meant for,

28:06.993 --> 28:08.916
if you know what they are related to

28:08.933 --> 28:10.666
as far as your physical side is concerned

28:10.675 --> 28:11.797
for doctors,

28:11.816 --> 28:13.446
then you will know

28:13.468 --> 28:16.428
that this person is suffering from this disease.

28:16.458 --> 28:19.387
Even small children, say ten children,

28:19.387 --> 28:24.161
you tie up their eyes and ask them,

28:24.211 --> 28:25.989
“What is this person suffering from?”

28:26.013 --> 28:28.412
So immediately supposing they give this

28:28.419 --> 28:31.632
you ask that fellow, “What about your throat? Is it all right?”

28:31.618 --> 28:32.942
“Ah no, it is not all right.”

28:32.961 --> 28:34.201
But how do they know?

28:34.199 --> 28:36.659
Because on the fingertip they know,

28:36.675 --> 28:38.229
they show the finger.

28:38.278 --> 28:40.788
So, everybody will say the same thing,

28:40.838 --> 28:42.999
because it is Absolute.

28:43.068 --> 28:44.542
This All-pervading Power

28:44.538 --> 28:46.512
about which people have talked about,

28:46.528 --> 28:48.182
they have called it Brahma Chaitanya

28:48.188 --> 28:50.123
They have called it all kinds of things

28:50.127 --> 28:52.712
but they don’t know what it is.

28:52.712 --> 28:57.007
It is this power that starts flowing

28:57.008 --> 28:58.936
and when it starts flowing through you,

28:58.936 --> 29:01.106
tremendous things happen,

29:01.106 --> 29:03.957
tremendous things happen.

29:03.977 --> 29:05.678
I have known so many bureaucrats

29:05.676 --> 29:07.448
you see, were so much worried, upset;

29:07.478 --> 29:09.948
because they were honest people and were suffering.

29:09.978 --> 29:10.978
They took to Sahaja Yoga.

29:10.988 --> 29:13.837
Their lives are changed now, they are enjoying themselves.

29:13.827 --> 29:15.357
They are not bothered.

29:15.357 --> 29:18.701
Because this not only guides you,

29:18.698 --> 29:20.371
this not only gives you knowledge

29:20.374 --> 29:22.590
but also protects you all the time.

29:22.594 --> 29:23.813
I have seen many doctors

29:23.814 --> 29:25.942
who are doing say heart trouble.

29:25.953 --> 29:29.032
Heart patients they are looking after.

29:29.048 --> 29:31.959
There are doctors who are curing cancer patients

29:31.989 --> 29:36.778
I met one doctor who has a dialysis hospital;

29:36.838 --> 29:41.096
but his kidneys.

29:41.145 --> 29:43.892
I said, “Doctor, how have you got this?”

29:43.885 --> 29:48.612
So, he is just treating only people for dialysis and he gets his kidneys

29:48.635 --> 29:51.342
So, there is no protection.

29:51.353 --> 29:54.933
You should also have the protection as a surgeon has.

29:54.965 --> 29:57.016
He will tie up his hands and everything.

29:57.066 --> 30:01.253
But then otherwise normally doctors have no protection of any kind

30:01.281 --> 30:03.241
when they treat another person

30:03.261 --> 30:04.711
and if they are sensitive,

30:04.771 --> 30:07.807
they may catch from them slowly, slowly the diseases,

30:07.832 --> 30:09.657
which they are going to cure.

30:09.689 --> 30:12.788
This is also a point nobody thinks of.

30:12.785 --> 30:15.498
We are not machines, we are human beings,

30:15.494 --> 30:19.969
we are not a stone, but we are sensitive

30:19.987 --> 30:22.548
and when you see somebody suffering

30:22.557 --> 30:25.273
you catch from them.

30:25.297 --> 30:26.548
You definitely catch

30:26.564 --> 30:29.006
but in Sahaja Yoga you know you are catching.

30:29.033 --> 30:31.706
In Sahaja Yoga you know what you are catching

30:31.726 --> 30:36.026
and you know how to clear it out and how to protect yourself.

30:36.096 --> 30:38.596
Now this is what one doesn’t understand

30:38.655 --> 30:42.093
that all human beings can get their Self-realisation,

30:42.105 --> 30:43.173
all of them.

30:43.200 --> 30:46.329
Only thing if you are thinking

30:46.339 --> 30:49.363
that you are a great scientist

30:49.380 --> 30:53.104
and you are above everything and you have read everything,

30:53.130 --> 30:55.078
“I don’t have to know anything”,

30:55.094 --> 30:56.858
then it doesn’t work.

30:56.874 --> 30:58.249
It cannot force.

30:58.253 --> 31:01.368
Sahaja Yoga cannot force on you its knowledge, nothing.

31:01.403 --> 31:05.027
It respects you, and respects your freedom.

31:05.041 --> 31:06.551
Freedom has been given to you

31:06.582 --> 31:10.082
whether you take to it or don’t take to it, is your own.

31:10.082 --> 31:15.071
But if you want it, if you are really desirous of getting it

31:15.078 --> 31:17.041
then you get it.

31:17.048 --> 31:18.759
But with that you get knowledge

31:18.818 --> 31:20.801
not only about medical science

31:20.788 --> 31:23.222
but also about people.

31:23.266 --> 31:28.521
Now there are so many types of God men coming.

31:28.535 --> 31:30.994
Now how will you know they are not correct?

31:31.010 --> 31:33.010
How will you?

31:33.050 --> 31:37.191
How will you know that Guru Nanaka was a great,

31:37.181 --> 31:39.951
not only saint but an incarnation?

31:39.951 --> 31:41.443
How will you know about Christ?

31:41.493 --> 31:44.144
How will you know about anyone of them

31:44.153 --> 31:45.943
because you don’t know the Absolute?

31:45.963 --> 31:47.321
You are born like that,

31:47.334 --> 31:49.134
but once you are born in Sahaja Yoga,

31:49.183 --> 31:50.673
you become a Yogi.

31:50.723 --> 31:54.209
And then you know exactly that they are all one.

31:54.211 --> 31:55.769
All the Sufis are one,

31:55.770 --> 31:58.479
all these great Prophets are one.

31:58.509 --> 32:03.438
All these we can call them Prophets

32:03.451 --> 32:05.478
and also incarnations,

32:05.484 --> 32:07.807
they're altogether one.

32:07.785 --> 32:09.365
Christ himself has said,

32:09.434 --> 32:11.634
“Those who are not against us are with us.”

32:11.684 --> 32:14.046
But how many Christians understand this?

32:14.075 --> 32:16.756
So, there is no need to have different, different religions.

32:16.760 --> 32:20.540
It’s in one big huge ocean of knowledge

32:20.590 --> 32:24.810
which has different, different, we can say, ports

32:24.861 --> 32:27.618
but that doesn’t mean the ocean is different.

32:27.618 --> 32:29.614
All your problems will be solved

32:29.693 --> 32:33.584
as far as integration of religions are concerned

32:33.604 --> 32:36.034
and you don’t have to give up anything

32:36.036 --> 32:37.634
but respect everything

32:37.635 --> 32:42.263
in the right manner that you know about them.

32:42.271 --> 32:44.031
There is nothing to discard,

32:44.102 --> 32:46.684
nothing to condemn

32:46.701 --> 32:49.582
but you just, to know about them,

32:49.592 --> 32:51.628
then you are amazed

32:51.648 --> 32:54.871
how they are talking the same thing what you are talking.

32:54.878 --> 32:56.731
I have read a book

32:56.731 --> 33:01.611
written by a one great Sufi from Turkey

33:01.623 --> 33:06.508
and another I have read it with our Nisamuddin

33:06.532 --> 33:09.528
here who had written something

33:09.563 --> 33:11.978
and his disciples, just the same,

33:11.971 --> 33:13.818
they write the same thing.

33:13.820 --> 33:15.643
I mean there is no difference

33:15.663 --> 33:17.810
because absolute knowledge is the same,

33:17.840 --> 33:19.730
only expression may be different.

33:19.800 --> 33:22.461
They might use different expressions.

33:22.520 --> 33:26.443
So, you get out of this madness of religion also.

33:26.443 --> 33:29.125
Religion can never teach you to hate anyone,

33:29.134 --> 33:30.005
can never,

33:30.064 --> 33:34.565
because I am talking here about the power of love.

33:34.595 --> 33:38.213
This All-pervading Power is the power of love.

33:38.223 --> 33:39.233
It guides you;

33:39.253 --> 33:40.503
it looks after you,

33:40.554 --> 33:42.989
it cooperates, it coordinates.

33:43.009 --> 33:45.709
It is so efficient a government

33:45.738 --> 33:50.494
that I don’t think we can ever imagine how efficient it is

33:50.518 --> 33:52.834
and it works just like this.

33:52.854 --> 33:54.693
Sometimes it is very amazing

33:54.713 --> 33:57.374
I will tell you now, today a case of a lady

33:57.463 --> 34:01.189
which is a true case. Is she here now?

34:01.193 --> 34:02.798
Mexican, no?

34:02.808 --> 34:04.469
She might be here

34:04.479 --> 34:06.667
See, there's a lady. You are there!

34:06.669 --> 34:08.237
She is a lady here.

34:08.259 --> 34:12.172
She was working with the UN and when I went to New York, she got her Realisation

34:12.231 --> 34:16.132
and she became a very ardent Sahaja Yogi.

34:16.141 --> 34:19.101
It rose to that thing where we call shraddha.

34:23.242 --> 34:25.867
Then she wrote to me three letters

34:25.927 --> 34:30.612
telling me about some disease her son has got

34:30.681 --> 34:34.902
who is only eighteen years of age studying in Harvard University or something.

34:35.001 --> 34:39.629
She said, “Mother this disease some people get it in my family at old age and they die.”

34:39.650 --> 34:41.621
” It’s a special Mexican disease,

34:41.670 --> 34:44.059
it’s a big name as usual you see.

34:44.072 --> 34:48.333
So, I was thinking what to write to her

34:48.331 --> 34:50.682
and we’re just paying attention.

34:50.742 --> 34:54.253
And she said, “Should I bring my child there, what should I do?” and all that.

34:54.262 --> 34:56.063
And the fourth letter I find

34:56.143 --> 35:00.514
that the doctors have said that he is completely cured,

35:00.523 --> 35:02.405
there is nothing in it.

35:02.411 --> 35:04.947
Just imagine how quick it was.

35:07.065 --> 35:08.557
I mean, I was amazed.

35:08.563 --> 35:10.167
There are so many cases like that

35:10.182 --> 35:11.737
but this is something remarkable.

35:11.762 --> 35:14.231
Where is Mexico! I was in Pune

35:14.322 --> 35:18.411
and just see how this Paramchaitanya has done it.

35:19.371 --> 35:21.621
How it is kind!

35:21.681 --> 35:26.039
It is the power of love of God which looks after you.

35:26.048 --> 35:27.778
After all the One who has created us,

35:27.768 --> 35:31.018
the Creator is going to look after us, isn’t it?

35:31.099 --> 35:38.677
But we should have also little attention towards finding out what is the truth.

35:38.684 --> 35:40.487
Don’t accept anything,

35:40.494 --> 35:42.977
you have to find out the truth first of all

35:42.994 --> 35:44.963
and everybody has said that

35:45.023 --> 35:47.558
it is the same thing as everybody has said,

35:47.574 --> 35:49.364
you should know about yourself.

35:50.403 --> 35:52.458
Guru Nanaka’s thing I will say:

35:52.458 --> 35:58.774
Kahe ray Ban khojan Jai, Sada Niwasi Sada Alepa, Tohey sang samai

35:58.786 --> 36:03.418
Pusp maday jo Bas Basat Hai, Mukur Mahey ras chayi

36:03.489 --> 36:08.244
Taisai hi Hari basay nirantar, Ghat hi khojo bhai

36:08.248 --> 36:12.704
Kahay nanak bin aapa chinay, Mitay na bhram ki kai’

36:12.744 --> 36:16.273
He said you must know yourself. “Know thyself” Christ has said.

36:16.364 --> 36:18.554
Everybody has said you should know yourself.

36:18.614 --> 36:20.534
Now what is that knowing yourself?

36:20.583 --> 36:24.540
That is nothing but you are

36:24.579 --> 36:27.590
the principle is that the truth is this

36:27.659 --> 36:31.506
that you are not this body, this mind,

36:31.516 --> 36:33.866
you are not these emotions,

36:33.866 --> 36:36.246
you are not this ego,

36:36.366 --> 36:40.659
you are not these conditionings but you are the pure Spirit.

36:40.659 --> 36:42.813
All our saints have said that.

36:42.833 --> 36:45.452
Now we are not on that path.

36:45.472 --> 36:48.780
We are not looking out for what are we.

36:48.782 --> 36:50.214
If we are the Spirit,

36:50.242 --> 36:53.224
then how are we to become the Spirit?

36:53.242 --> 36:55.524
Now anybody who starts talking like that,

36:55.565 --> 36:58.054
I mean, I was very much opposed by many people

36:58.105 --> 37:00.985
because they thought I was just telling lies,

37:00.974 --> 37:05.241
I am this thing, that thing, but when they got sick, they came to Me.

37:05.241 --> 37:06.853
That’s not the way.

37:06.853 --> 37:12.230
The way is to try to know that we do not know the absolute.

37:12.242 --> 37:14.599
Once you become a little humble about it

37:14.592 --> 37:16.409
that we don’t know the absolute,

37:16.454 --> 37:19.704
so the religion and science become one

37:19.704 --> 37:24.884
because you can explain it scientifically as Dr. U.C. Rai has done

37:24.907 --> 37:28.407
Scientifically, you can explain what happens.

37:28.396 --> 37:30.016
Now you don’t have to become

37:30.016 --> 37:33.289
what you call ‘karm-kandi’, ‘ritualistic’, no need

37:33.318 --> 37:36.059
There is nothing to be done ritualistically, nothing.

37:36.088 --> 37:38.050
Once you are really realised,

37:38.048 --> 37:40.708
you have to do a little meditation everyday,

37:40.719 --> 37:42.159
in the evening.

37:42.168 --> 37:47.905
Now what I also would I should say this Paramchaitanya

37:47.914 --> 37:51.563
that it gave us a chance to have a hospital in Vashi

37:51.565 --> 37:53.913
and the results are very good in Vashi.

37:53.945 --> 37:56.733
They never use to charge anything for the outdoor patients

37:56.733 --> 37:58.036
but they said, “Mother,

37:58.032 --> 37:59.626
please allow us to take ten Rupees.”

37:59.655 --> 38:02.755
I said, “All right, take ten Rupees, is all right for everything."

38:02.766 --> 38:06.255
but the people who are living inside,

38:06.275 --> 38:08.413
they are also paying little amount;

38:08.436 --> 38:11.269
nothing compared to what people pay in the hospitals.

38:11.282 --> 38:14.932
And Dr. Rai has so sacrificingly accepted.

38:14.952 --> 38:17.708
And the doctors are coming from Russia all the way.

38:17.737 --> 38:20.748
You know, Russian doctors are wonderful doctors.

38:20.768 --> 38:23.597
They are very great scientists, I must say.

38:23.668 --> 38:29.786
They have gone very far in scientific approach.

38:29.836 --> 38:32.510
They have tried to find out the energies,

38:32.547 --> 38:33.797
which are subtle energies,

38:33.806 --> 38:35.385
and lots of things they have done,

38:35.396 --> 38:37.246
but specially, they are very much interested

38:37.317 --> 38:42.074
in working through Sahaja Yoga and they are coming down here to work.

38:42.077 --> 38:46.364
Now I would not expect our doctors to come and work like that,

38:46.376 --> 38:48.864
but at least for once a week,

38:48.876 --> 38:50.554
they can give some time

38:50.576 --> 38:57.019
and they can practice Sahaja Yoga just as a blessing to the people.

38:57.021 --> 38:59.422
Our country is full of very poor people,

38:59.431 --> 39:02.351
very, very poor people, extremely poor

39:02.362 --> 39:04.751
and we feel very much concerned.

39:04.782 --> 39:05.959
People always ask Me,

39:05.963 --> 39:07.929
“Yours is such a Yoga Bhoomi

39:07.943 --> 39:09.773
then, the, why the people are poor?

39:09.802 --> 39:11.043
The poor they are,

39:11.052 --> 39:14.708
because they do not follow the right path.

39:14.702 --> 39:16.909
You see, if they follow the right path,

39:16.932 --> 39:19.391
Lakshmi is also there to bless you.

39:19.429 --> 39:21.251
There is nothing to worry about money,

39:21.268 --> 39:22.986
nothing to worry about anything

39:22.992 --> 39:28.836
and you become a person who is absolutely in balance.

39:28.842 --> 39:31.501
As soon as something comes up,

39:31.521 --> 39:32.952
some crisis come up,

39:32.960 --> 39:35.561
immediately you all become silent

39:35.632 --> 39:38.652
and you start seeing what’s wrong,

39:38.661 --> 39:40.032
what is the problem.

39:40.052 --> 39:41.962
Because you are not silent,

39:41.985 --> 39:43.112
always in the conflict,

39:43.125 --> 39:45.062
you cannot see the problem clearly

39:45.085 --> 39:47.062
and you cannot solve it,

39:47.065 --> 39:50.864
but, you actually, you don’t solve any problem.

39:50.885 --> 39:53.235
It is this, I must say this power.

39:53.304 --> 39:56.409
I also tell them I don’t do anything; I am just sitting down;

39:56.409 --> 39:57.754
this power is doing everything.

39:57.750 --> 39:58.904
They don’t believe it

39:58.909 --> 40:00.324
but it is a fact.

40:00.320 --> 40:02.024
I am not doing anything, I am just sitting,

40:02.039 --> 40:05.124
I am not planning, I am not doing anything whatsoever

40:05.135 --> 40:07.215
but this power does everything for us

40:07.264 --> 40:08.434
so why should I do it.

40:08.505 --> 40:12.746
But, it’s rather difficult for human beings to leave things to this power.

40:12.764 --> 40:16.226
Even some doctors, who have been practising Medical Science

40:16.244 --> 40:20.065
have had very funny experiences

40:20.076 --> 40:22.746
Like there’s one Dr. Amjad Ali in Australia

40:22.766 --> 40:24.703
who is very well qualified

40:24.697 --> 40:27.513
and he was experimenting

40:27.516 --> 40:30.947
on some sort of “kya kar rahe they.”

40:34.465 --> 40:36.907
So, you see that what he found

40:36.987 --> 40:41.048
when he went close to them, they start becoming smaller.

40:41.056 --> 40:42.228
He could not experiment.

40:42.233 --> 40:44.588
He said, “How my experiment will go?

40:44.623 --> 40:48.173
Because I cannot! As soon as I go near them, everything disappears,

40:48.173 --> 40:49.380
all the disease disappears,

40:49.403 --> 40:50.360
so what can I do?”

40:50.364 --> 40:52.460
I said, “You don’t experiment with that

40:52.469 --> 40:57.380
but you can experiment with the people who are already sick and do something about it.”

40:57.360 --> 40:58.849
So, there are many things like that.

40:58.849 --> 41:00.951
And another person told me that in England

41:00.949 --> 41:03.320
there is a craze for research.

41:03.360 --> 41:08.869
So, one scientist, they told him, “You find out what is minus 273,

41:08.929 --> 41:10.260
the absolute zero.

41:10.329 --> 41:15.627
So, he said, “I cannot, because the formula is such that some heat will remain always there.”

41:15.628 --> 41:16.647
I said, “All right,

41:16.644 --> 41:18.277
do one thing,

41:18.284 --> 41:21.844
you go and tell them this is absolute and how can we find absolute.”

41:21.860 --> 41:23.641
“We cannot find Absolute.

41:23.675 --> 41:27.032
It is absolutely, absolutely beyond us”.

41:27.041 --> 41:30.711
Then I said, “You use vibrations and you use these Divine vibrations.”

41:30.724 --> 41:33.777
And he achieved it. He got his doctorate and he did it.

41:33.784 --> 41:35.318
So, they asked him, “How did you do it?”

41:35.327 --> 41:37.108
He said, “I cannot explain to you.”

41:37.106 --> 41:38.478
“Because if I talk to them,

41:38.496 --> 41:39.797
they will never listen to me.

41:39.806 --> 41:42.179
These scientists, you know, they think no end of themselves.

41:42.197 --> 41:45.278
How can I tell them that I did it with this Divine Power?”

41:45.293 --> 41:47.896
They cannot believe that there is another big power

41:47.916 --> 41:49.795
After all who runs our heart?

41:49.815 --> 41:52.405
Ask the doctors who runs our heart.

41:52.425 --> 41:54.275
They will say Autonomous Nervous System.

41:54.306 --> 41:56.266
Now who is this Auto?

41:56.275 --> 41:57.813
Ask this question second one.

41:57.826 --> 41:58.903
You can’t answer.

41:58.918 --> 42:00.164
Who is this Auto?

42:00.170 --> 42:01.304
‘Auto’ you don’t know.

42:01.327 --> 42:02.387
They will just…

42:02.407 --> 42:04.730
But they are honest because they say, “We don’t know”

42:04.719 --> 42:07.240
and they have put it the name ‘Autonomous’.

42:07.260 --> 42:10.260
Now I am talking of parasympathetic nervous system,

42:10.264 --> 42:12.061
as you know very well.

42:12.074 --> 42:14.331
And we know very little about parasympathetic.

42:14.344 --> 42:15.370
It’s a fact.

42:15.400 --> 42:16.891
How for other people

42:16.898 --> 42:21.648
I will tell you that in very simple words what is parasympathetic.

42:21.668 --> 42:24.057
Now when there is some emergency,

42:24.047 --> 42:27.579
our sympathetic nervous system which is to the left and right side

42:27.579 --> 42:29.882
go into motion.

42:29.880 --> 42:31.353
Like, we have to run,

42:31.349 --> 42:36.103
then if you are running, our heart will start pumping blood.

42:36.119 --> 42:39.463
But what brings it back to normal,

42:39.478 --> 42:42.119
is the parasympathetic, in simple words.

42:45.989 --> 42:49.202
So, this parasympathetic nervous system,

42:49.215 --> 42:51.413
when it is filled with energy,

42:51.396 --> 42:54.943
when it is filled with energy it just settles down.

42:54.956 --> 42:56.632
It gets nourished

42:56.655 --> 43:00.282
and then it starts working in such a beautiful manner

43:00.306 --> 43:05.103
that you achieve so many things which you could not normally achieve.

43:05.114 --> 43:09.695
First thing that happens that you become a very peaceful personality,

43:11.264 --> 43:13.434
very peaceful.

43:13.454 --> 43:15.606
Because we are thinking,

43:15.610 --> 43:19.617
now the thoughts are rising and falling, again thoughts are rising and falling,

43:19.639 --> 43:21.757
again thoughts are rising and falling.

43:21.780 --> 43:25.666
All the time we are jumping on the cusp of the thoughts.

43:25.686 --> 43:28.927
But there is a space in between

43:28.967 --> 43:31.396
and that is in Sanskrit called ‘vilambha’.

43:31.456 --> 43:34.922
But we can call it ‘pause’ in English language.

43:34.931 --> 43:37.972
Now this is the time

43:37.990 --> 43:41.201
where we never see that point.

43:41.210 --> 43:42.612
We never are there.

43:42.621 --> 43:44.081
So, when we are jumping,

43:44.101 --> 43:46.867
we are jumping in the future or in the past

43:46.864 --> 43:49.153
For example, just now, you are sitting before Me,

43:49.143 --> 43:51.563
maybe you are thinking if they will get a train or not,

43:51.574 --> 43:53.713
a bus or not, this and that,

43:53.773 --> 43:56.184
or maybe you are thinking about your past.

43:56.233 --> 43:58.856
But you cannot be in the centre.

43:58.884 --> 44:00.407
This is the big problem.

44:00.427 --> 44:04.246
You cannot be in the present.

44:04.257 --> 44:07.197
If I say, “Be in the present”, you cannot.

44:07.217 --> 44:09.657
And in the present is reality.

44:09.677 --> 44:14.016
In the present is totality and in the present is silence.

44:14.016 --> 44:15.606
You don’t think.

44:15.615 --> 44:19.001
So, according to even to Patanjali

44:18.996 --> 44:21.501
you have to become Nirvichar.

44:21.510 --> 44:23.952
These thoughts which are bombarding your head,

44:23.942 --> 44:26.632
you have to become in charge of them,

44:26.702 --> 44:28.702
you have to be in control with them.

44:28.692 --> 44:31.188
So, what happens? You become Nirvichar,

44:31.192 --> 44:32.478
without any thoughts.

44:32.512 --> 44:33.947
It’s a thoughtless awareness.

44:33.945 --> 44:36.878
And this thoughtless awareness

44:36.896 --> 44:41.478
is the one that gives you complete peace within yourself.

44:41.485 --> 44:43.409
People talk of peace, other.

44:43.416 --> 44:45.735
I know of people who have got peace awards,

44:45.728 --> 44:48.741
big, big, such hot-tempered people

44:48.751 --> 44:52.324
that you have to approach them with a barge pole.

44:52.333 --> 44:55.934
I don’t know from what angle they are talking about peace

44:55.965 --> 44:58.076
but they have got peace awards.

44:58.096 --> 45:01.708
Big, big people like that I have known who have got peace awards.

45:01.715 --> 45:04.076
Peace has to come within.

45:04.101 --> 45:06.521
When human beings become peaceful,

45:06.525 --> 45:07.815
there won’t be any quarrels,

45:07.856 --> 45:12.050
no fights, no wars and no politics.

45:12.067 --> 45:13.577
If you are peaceful,

45:13.646 --> 45:16.110
then you are so satisfied,

45:16.137 --> 45:20.510
you're as in Hindi, they say, “Apney me hi sama jatey hai,”

45:20.496 --> 45:22.789
you are satisfied with yourself.

45:22.791 --> 45:26.757
You don’t get into the mad rush

45:26.800 --> 45:32.018
of approaching somebody, encroaching somebody,

45:32.056 --> 45:34.175
aggressing on someone;

45:34.186 --> 45:37.876
no, you are with yourself in complete peace.

45:37.896 --> 45:41.065
As a result, so many things happen.

45:41.115 --> 45:44.239
Maybe I am the oldest person living here.

45:44.228 --> 45:47.668
Nobody can be more in age

45:47.717 --> 45:50.034
because I am seventy-four now. I will be seventy-five.

45:50.057 --> 45:51.295
So, you can imagine.

45:51.318 --> 45:56.929
But at peace when you are, you are not having any such ideas of aggression,

45:56.949 --> 45:58.489
aggression or anything.

45:58.489 --> 46:01.070
You become absolutely peaceful

46:01.088 --> 46:04.193
and this peace is very required today

46:04.199 --> 46:06.728
for this world to come to something

46:06.760 --> 46:09.563
which we call as a peaceful world.

46:09.579 --> 46:12.733
By fighting, by quarrelling you can never achieve peace.

46:12.748 --> 46:15.478
I have seen people going with the flags,

46:15.547 --> 46:19.039
now fight for peace and fight for this, no need.

46:19.018 --> 46:22.820
If you become peaceful everything works out so well

46:22.827 --> 46:26.521
and this Paramchaitanya is with you to help you.

46:26.545 --> 46:28.791
There is no need to fight anybody,

46:28.806 --> 46:32.070
to aggress anybody or to trouble anybody

46:32.096 --> 46:35.121
This is very important for doctors

46:35.130 --> 46:37.862
and for also business people

46:37.871 --> 46:39.681
Now the problem of business people

46:39.681 --> 46:42.061
because they told me there are some business people also

46:42.092 --> 46:45.411
is their stress which is a common disease.

46:45.422 --> 46:48.264
They are the same, very futuristic, you know,

46:48.282 --> 46:51.447
all the time calculating, very, very futuristic.

46:51.443 --> 46:53.697
And in America, a new disease has developed,

46:53.713 --> 46:55.364
they call it ‘yuppies disease'

47:09.278 --> 47:11.978
That disease is such a horrible thing it is,

47:12.059 --> 47:15.527
it is that your rational mind just goes out,

47:15.548 --> 47:17.748
your conscious mind just goes out,

47:17.769 --> 47:19.648
you can’t even lift your hand,

47:19.659 --> 47:21.987
you can’t even lift your fingers

47:22.014 --> 47:26.731
and people carry you just like what you can call a

47:26.733 --> 47:28.382
reptile on your body.

47:28.393 --> 47:30.351
You can think all right,

47:30.375 --> 47:35.574
you can talk all right,

47:35.664 --> 47:37.222
you can plan all right,

47:37.235 --> 47:38.882
calculate all right

47:38.882 --> 47:39.961
but you cannot walk,

47:39.942 --> 47:41.181
you cannot lift your hand,

47:41.192 --> 47:43.052
you cannot do anything.

47:43.072 --> 47:45.911
This is a new disease that has come in America

47:45.922 --> 47:50.335
and is spreading all over and I have seen one patient also here.

47:50.355 --> 47:54.684
So, what I am trying to say that going with this your stress,

47:54.686 --> 47:57.074
all kind of things can happen.

47:57.105 --> 48:00.356
Now why this stress is there, that also we should know.

48:01.666 --> 48:03.103
First of all,

48:03.094 --> 48:06.302
the Kundalini has started working in this Kali Yuga

48:06.304 --> 48:07.552
in these times.

48:07.554 --> 48:09.961
Secondly, if you see these two centres,

48:09.978 --> 48:12.458
two Nadis or two channels,

48:12.509 --> 48:14.289
we call Ida and Pingala Nadi.

48:14.298 --> 48:18.594
So, the Pingala Nadi creates Ego within us,

48:18.619 --> 48:20.414
as it is shown there,

48:20.418 --> 48:21.574
you see, the yellow one.

48:21.577 --> 48:25.655
It creates a balloon like.

48:25.670 --> 48:28.996
Then the second one is the Ida Nadi

48:29.030 --> 48:32.385
which also creates a balloon.

48:32.407 --> 48:35.603
Now Ida [Pingala] Nadi creates the ego balloon

48:35.626 --> 48:40.364
and the left side one creates the superego, means conditionings

48:40.387 --> 48:42.284
Now if you are identified with something,

48:42.291 --> 48:44.213
if you are conditioned within you with something,

48:44.231 --> 48:46.202
then these two are there.

48:46.262 --> 48:48.456
But when you are too much right sided,

48:48.492 --> 48:53.099
these are all – you see the ego moves and covers the left side.

48:53.099 --> 48:55.469
So, there is a blockage, complete blockage.

48:55.528 --> 48:57.929
Now whatever problems you have

48:57.989 --> 49:00.485
they cannot pass out of your body.

49:00.492 --> 49:02.775
That makes you weaker and weaker

49:02.782 --> 49:05.715
and that’s how you have stress.

49:05.742 --> 49:07.306
With this Kundalini,

49:07.324 --> 49:09.445
these two move out like that

49:09.503 --> 49:14.204
and is opened out and you become one with this Divine Power.

49:14.233 --> 49:18.327
Now as far as the brain is, for there are some neurosurgeons also,

49:18.353 --> 49:20.496
as far as the brain is concerned,

49:20.556 --> 49:23.317
we know that we use wee part of our brain,

49:23.327 --> 49:25.266
very little part of our brain.

49:25.266 --> 49:29.085
But once you get this Kundalini then it enlightens

49:29.096 --> 49:34.326
so many areas of your head that you just know

49:34.396 --> 49:36.556
Sometimes people ask Me, “Mother, how do you know?”

49:36.596 --> 49:39.356
“I know. I don’t know how I know.”

49:39.367 --> 49:41.007
There is no technique for it.

49:41.007 --> 49:42.177
Just I know.

49:42.197 --> 49:43.936
They say, “Mother, how do you know this thing?

49:43.958 --> 49:44.976
How do you know?”

49:44.987 --> 49:46.286
Somebody wrote me a letter

49:46.307 --> 49:48.626
and I said, “Who has written this letter, I know.”

49:48.637 --> 49:50.025
And I told them,

49:50.025 --> 49:51.496
they said, “Mother, how do you know?”

49:51.525 --> 49:54.786
I said, “I know for definite this is the one who has written.”

49:54.786 --> 49:56.615
I don’t know that person. I have never seen him.

49:56.615 --> 49:58.554
I've never seen his hand writing

49:58.635 --> 50:00.775
but I said, “I know who has written this letter.”

50:00.771 --> 50:02.135
Just I know.

50:02.141 --> 50:05.458
But I wouldn’t say that it’s something great

50:05.488 --> 50:09.097
that I should know because I just know without any work,

50:09.092 --> 50:11.556
without any thinking,

50:11.577 --> 50:15.259
without any managing. Just automatically I know everything.

50:15.327 --> 50:18.867
So, once you become that, you don’t have to worry.

50:18.916 --> 50:23.817
Now, for example, I know, also, a lady doctor in Delhi,

50:23.856 --> 50:25.485
no in Bombay.

50:25.496 --> 50:28.295
She is the one who is a surgeon.

50:28.297 --> 50:34.652
She said, “Mother I could know that this man has tumour,

50:34.652 --> 50:38.652
very much low in his brains but it will come out.”

50:38.663 --> 50:42.402
So, she said, “Then I was just giving vibrations first.

50:42.416 --> 50:45.059
I said let me try first the vibrations on that.”

50:45.056 --> 50:47.659
They said, “No, No, there is no tumour on that side.”

50:47.677 --> 50:50.489
She said, “It is here. I know I can feel it; it is here.”

50:50.487 --> 50:52.818
They wouldn’t, they started arguing with her

50:52.846 --> 50:55.364
and then they found out the tumour where she said,

50:55.376 --> 50:56.753
exactly there.

50:56.766 --> 50:58.094
They said, “How do you know?”

50:58.115 --> 51:00.322
She said, “I don’t know how do I know.”

51:00.346 --> 51:03.474
So even the children can tell where is the problem,

51:03.476 --> 51:07.804
in your head, in your brain, what is happening.

51:07.804 --> 51:13.155
Now to look after your brain is very important that you don’t go into imbalances

51:13.146 --> 51:14.916
because if you go into imbalance,

51:14.965 --> 51:18.650
your right side will develop or your left side will develop.

51:18.668 --> 51:20.929
Actually, the right side develops on the left

51:20.938 --> 51:23.280
and the left side develops on the right.

51:23.257 --> 51:26.668
Now also I don’t know how far the medical science has gone

51:26.717 --> 51:30.608
up to the understanding as to left and right side

51:30.668 --> 51:34.434
are two different complementary systems.

51:34.489 --> 51:36.949
I don’t know if that they accept, do they?

51:40.282 --> 51:46.045
But in Sahaja Yoga you will discover that there are two complementary systems.

51:48.275 --> 51:51.119
One is right sided; one is left sided.

51:51.135 --> 51:55.259
And when the right side is too much then the left side might act

51:55.259 --> 51:58.559
or when the left side is too much, then right side may act.

51:58.568 --> 52:01.159
You see it’s a complimentary two systems

52:01.228 --> 52:03.847
and if you go on one system all the time

52:03.896 --> 52:07.097
then you become right sided or left sided.

52:07.106 --> 52:09.907
Now left sided are the people who are not futuristic

52:09.916 --> 52:13.436
but who are the people who live in the past.

52:13.445 --> 52:17.036
Now of course I don’t want to, just now, discuss about it very much

52:17.059 --> 52:21.862
because it’s also more confusing for people.

52:21.869 --> 52:23.521
Because they don’t want to believe

52:23.539 --> 52:25.918
that there is something like dead souls

52:25.958 --> 52:32.512
or they don’t want to believe in the viruses being dead vegetables

52:32.516 --> 52:35.764
and things like that but it is.

52:35.777 --> 52:37.213
On the left-hand side,

52:37.204 --> 52:40.463
we have got all our past since our creation.

52:40.463 --> 52:42.875
So, if somebody gets virus you give antibiotics,

52:42.889 --> 52:45.894
you do what you like, it won’t go.

52:45.918 --> 52:48.570
Only Sahaja Yoga can drive it out.

52:48.570 --> 52:51.735
Only through Sahaja Yoga you can cure viruses

52:51.750 --> 52:54.659
because only Sahaja Yoga can act on the left side.

52:54.670 --> 52:59.829
Many mad people, crazy people have been cured through Sahaja Yoga.

52:59.840 --> 53:05.853
Also, it gives you a good idea about

53:05.849 --> 53:08.914
how you can show people,

53:08.923 --> 53:11.492
who is mad and who is not mad.

53:11.494 --> 53:14.563
Like I had a program in Pune in the beginning

53:14.563 --> 53:20.943
and they arranged it in a hall which was owned by some Brahmins.

53:20.976 --> 53:24.230
So, when I went there, they said, “No, no, She is not a Brahmin

53:24.215 --> 53:25.880
so we can’t give Her the hall.

53:25.891 --> 53:27.739
So, Sahaja Yogis were mischievous,

53:27.771 --> 53:30.989
they said, “All right, we will give it in the newspaper that they are refusing

53:31.001 --> 53:32.489
because She is not a Brahmin.”

53:32.492 --> 53:35.208
“No, no, don’t do like that we will have it.”

53:35.231 --> 53:37.989
So, I didn’t know what was happening behind the back.

53:38.048 --> 53:39.809
When I went there, I was sitting there.

53:39.818 --> 53:44.273
Very interesting I saw about twenty-five people sitting in front of me shaking

53:44.262 --> 53:45.842
like this

53:45.853 --> 53:46.998
“Mother, stop it, stop it

53:47.012 --> 53:48.393
we know Your powers, stop it.”

53:48.393 --> 53:50.163
I said, “I am not doing anything, you are….”

53:50.182 --> 53:54.030
They said, “Now, also there are people who are shaking like this.”

53:54.023 --> 53:56.460
So, I said, “Ask them, who they are?”

53:56.476 --> 54:00.739
They said, “We are certified mad from Thana.

54:00.746 --> 54:03.106
We have come here with our superintendent

54:03.126 --> 54:05.670
because You had cured one mad man.”

54:05.679 --> 54:09.130
“So”, they said, “Are we also mad?” “Yes, there is something wrong.”

54:09.148 --> 54:10.719
So, the thing was

54:10.739 --> 54:13.998
they were thinking the Brahmins are the highest or something like that.

54:14.028 --> 54:16.382
Is all nonsensical ideas

54:16.411 --> 54:19.190
because Brahmin is that which knows the Brahma,

54:19.211 --> 54:21.889
which knows All Pervading Power.

54:21.911 --> 54:25.742
And because of these funny ideas, they have tortured all the saints.

54:25.802 --> 54:28.260
Specially in Maharashtra

54:28.260 --> 54:32.179
people have tortured all the saints all the time.

54:32.204 --> 54:35.423
So, where you have so many saints

54:35.474 --> 54:36.636
and so many people

54:36.646 --> 54:40.081
then you must know that it was just to work out

54:40.099 --> 54:43.451
the brains of these close-minded people.

54:43.478 --> 54:48.699
But to open them out is only possible I think when they are in difficulties.

54:48.759 --> 54:51.695
When they are not in difficulties they don’t want to accept.

54:51.708 --> 54:54.704
Supposing they are sick then they will come to Me.

54:54.717 --> 54:58.333
Now if you cure somebody sick, you see once he is cured, he is finished.

54:58.338 --> 55:01.684
He doesn’t do any Sahaja Yoga; he doesn’t want to help anyone.

55:01.693 --> 55:05.853
But if there is a person who is healthy,

55:05.884 --> 55:08.188
who is perfectly all right

55:08.184 --> 55:10.639
and who is knowledgeable,

55:10.634 --> 55:13.079
if he comes to Sahaja Yoga, he will be such a help

55:13.079 --> 55:17.581
to this, I should say, to this poor country.

55:17.588 --> 55:20.880
This country is suffering from tremendous poverty.

55:20.898 --> 55:22.744
Now only saying,

55:22.773 --> 55:26.164
“Garibi Hatao, Garibi Hatao, Garibi Hatao” (“Eliminate poverty!”)

55:26.155 --> 55:29.554
I know of one gentleman who was a great corrupt fellow

55:29.574 --> 55:33.030
and who used to live in one room with a little cot.

55:33.050 --> 55:34.882
I said, “Why do you live like this?”

55:34.900 --> 55:37.822
He said, “Because, everybody is garib [poor] so I want to live like garib.”

55:37.831 --> 55:40.052
I said, “Why don’t you give all this money to these garibs?

55:40.070 --> 55:41.911
Why are you lying like this?”

55:41.931 --> 55:44.550
He said, “All right, you suggest to me any organisation

55:44.621 --> 55:48.931
which is absolutely above board and I will move.”

55:48.931 --> 55:51.588
That was a difficult thing, a decision.

55:51.590 --> 55:52.847
But what I am trying to say

55:52.880 --> 55:55.289
only by saying people are garib, garib,

55:55.349 --> 55:57.679
you have to attend to that

55:57.699 --> 56:00.179
and is only possible through Sahaja Yoga.

56:00.190 --> 56:01.320
How?

56:01.326 --> 56:05.885
Sahaja Yoga is practiced mostly by middle class.

56:05.905 --> 56:10.275
Both the sides are – one side are the poor, another side are the rich.

56:10.346 --> 56:13.655
Rich are very few. But more by the middle class.

56:13.668 --> 56:17.545
Then it’s like a river which expands on both the sides

56:17.565 --> 56:22.092
This time I was, I mean, I have been always thinking that

56:22.094 --> 56:24.905
I have to do something for the poor people,

56:24.932 --> 56:28.324
something, always and I have done also, on my own,

56:28.338 --> 56:31.494
but I wanted Sahaja Yogis to contribute, Indian Sahaja Yogis.

56:31.489 --> 56:34.143
So, I told them I want to start a place

56:34.139 --> 56:37.878
where we could have these women

56:37.873 --> 56:41.963
who are standing on the roads with their children asking for alms.

56:42.007 --> 56:44.814
We can have something to help them.

56:44.834 --> 56:48.018
Immediately, I was surprised Sahaja Yogis contributed to me

56:48.047 --> 56:52.237
for that and I was so amazed at their enthusiasm.

56:52.260 --> 56:54.061
I said, “This is the generosity.

56:54.112 --> 56:57.039
This generosity that has come to Sahaja Yogis.”

56:57.050 --> 57:01.630
And then when they said, “Mother this is we have got all this through Sahaja Yoga

57:01.650 --> 57:05.710
We have improved so much that we don’t have to worry.”

57:05.744 --> 57:10.063
And they so generously, I mean a person becomes extremely generous.

57:10.083 --> 57:12.143
He becomes very peaceful;

57:12.164 --> 57:16.514
he becomes generous and he starts enjoying the generosity.

57:16.518 --> 57:19.014
I mean people earn such a lot of money.

57:19.009 --> 57:21.668
Everything they should do there is no harm.

57:21.739 --> 57:24.438
In Sahaja Yoga, there is nothing like sanyasa.

57:24.498 --> 57:26.242
Nobody has to take sanyas.

57:26.228 --> 57:29.003
Nobody has to go out of his family,

57:29.032 --> 57:33.974
out of his … nothing. It’s all here. Why to go anywhere?

57:33.974 --> 57:37.440
So, you have to be a very normal person.

57:37.489 --> 57:39.789
But one thing is important,

57:39.840 --> 57:44.673
you must have the pure desire to get your Realisation.

57:44.692 --> 57:48.731
If you don’t have that pure Realisation then it doesn’t work out.

57:48.742 --> 57:50.574
Apart from that it might work

57:50.592 --> 57:52.213
but you go on dropping down

57:52.224 --> 57:54.786
because if you want to make money out of Sahaja Yoga

57:54.775 --> 57:58.976
or if you want to, say, achieve some power out of it.

57:58.974 --> 58:00.282
You see, you are so powerful

58:00.304 --> 58:03.547
that you don’t have to ask for power or anything.

58:03.572 --> 58:07.097
You don’t know how it works and how it gives.

58:07.103 --> 58:09.887
First of all, only we have to believe

58:09.887 --> 58:15.108
that we are reflections of God Almighty.

58:15.128 --> 58:17.668
We're not just human beings.

58:17.677 --> 58:21.159
Specially, to be born in India

58:21.168 --> 58:23.141
you must have done lots of punyas,

58:23.168 --> 58:27.509
otherwise you cannot be born in this great country I can tell you.

58:27.539 --> 58:31.188
All this, you see, is all nonsense that is going on,

58:31.199 --> 58:34.757
is just skirmishes on the periphery,

58:34.780 --> 58:38.769
but if you see the culture,

58:38.820 --> 58:42.061
the love, affection we have,

58:42.074 --> 58:45.351
the understanding of value system we have,

58:45.355 --> 58:46.621
you can’t imagine it.

58:46.646 --> 58:48.670
When you go abroad, you are amazed.

58:48.686 --> 58:51.590
you don’t know how to tell them.

58:51.605 --> 58:52.920
They're so stupid,

58:52.990 --> 58:56.871
I tell you, very stupid people, nothing to learn from them.

58:56.931 --> 59:01.820
I have been fighting with the stupidity of people specially Americans.

59:01.880 --> 59:06.023
I'm surprised, I think that they are not yet grown up as human beings.

59:06.045 --> 59:08.123
The way they talk, the way they understand.

59:08.135 --> 59:11.818
They only like people who will come and tell them stories

59:11.844 --> 59:14.574
and make fool out of them, make lot of money.

59:14.625 --> 59:16.897
To me they said, “We cannot take to Sahaja Yoga.”

59:16.876 --> 59:17.917
I said, “Why?”

59:17.905 --> 59:19.193
“Because you don’t take money,

59:19.206 --> 59:20.945
what is your validity?

59:20.956 --> 59:23.485
If you don’t take money then you have no validity,

59:23.545 --> 59:26.283
why should we believe in you because …”

59:26.286 --> 59:30.073
I said, “Supposing I take money, then?” “Then we can prosecute you.”

59:30.088 --> 59:32.813
I said, “Go and prosecute all these people who have looted you”.

59:32.827 --> 59:34.933
Nobody could prosecute them.

59:34.947 --> 59:40.619
So, this is we should not look to them for understanding of life.

59:40.623 --> 59:42.018
They have not yet understood.

59:42.038 --> 59:44.179
We have to look to ourselves.

59:44.184 --> 59:46.250
We have such a heritage.

59:46.284 --> 59:48.409
You can imagine, thousands of years back,

59:48.403 --> 59:50.443
we have been talking of Brahma,

59:50.494 --> 59:55.818
we have been talking of absolute truth.

59:55.838 --> 59:59.118
In what country they have this kind of knowledge.

59:59.118 --> 01:00:00.105
No country.

01:00:00.108 --> 01:00:04.472
So, first of all we should be very proud to be an Indian.

01:00:04.489 --> 01:00:05.911
That’s very important.

01:00:05.922 --> 01:00:08.661
Even Sahaja Yogis from abroad they dress up like Indians

01:00:08.702 --> 01:00:10.791
and they have taken to our culture,

01:00:10.791 --> 01:00:12.478
our style of culture.

01:00:12.467 --> 01:00:14.833
I need not tell you about the Western Culture

01:00:14.893 --> 01:00:17.507
as I was really shocked.

01:00:17.514 --> 01:00:20.195
Then I thought I better write down something about them

01:00:20.204 --> 01:00:21.965
as a witness whatever I saw.

01:00:21.963 --> 01:00:24.344
So, there is nothing to learn from them,

01:00:24.414 --> 01:00:28.353
but one day will come, they have to come here.

01:00:28.363 --> 01:00:30.822
All the doctors have to come here.

01:00:30.851 --> 01:00:34.902
I am very thankful, very, very thankful

01:00:34.911 --> 01:00:38.672
to this Indian Medical Association especially.

01:00:38.719 --> 01:00:44.382
I never expected and I am very grateful to them for this

01:00:44.385 --> 01:00:48.432
because I know in this country if the doctors take it up,

01:00:48.452 --> 01:00:52.037
all over the world they will have to understand

01:00:58.125 --> 01:01:04.918
the value of our knowledge of life and of Medical Science.

01:01:04.918 --> 01:01:08.389
I would say that I have seen so many people sitting here

01:01:08.429 --> 01:01:09.790
I don’t know how many are doctors,

01:01:09.798 --> 01:01:13.480
how many are from industries and how many are Sahaja Yogis.

01:01:13.476 --> 01:01:16.990
Whatever it is, one has to know that all of us

01:01:17.003 --> 01:01:20.614
are blessed by the same reflection of God Almighty

01:01:20.673 --> 01:01:23.582
within ourselves which we should experience.

01:01:23.606 --> 01:01:27.072
After that you will tell me what has happened to you,

01:01:27.076 --> 01:01:30.202
what you have felt and what you had.

01:01:30.217 --> 01:01:34.012
It’s a thing, is a matter of your right to have it.

01:01:34.019 --> 01:01:36.642
It’s your right to have that power

01:01:36.653 --> 01:01:39.554
but you have to ask for it.

01:01:39.614 --> 01:01:42.333
If you don’t ask for it, I cannot force it on you.

01:01:42.384 --> 01:01:44.333
Nobody can force it on you.

01:01:44.393 --> 01:01:46.335
It is a very spontaneous happening

01:01:46.414 --> 01:01:51.224
and it works out, so fast, so fast.

01:01:51.224 --> 01:01:53.277
I must tell you in Russia,

01:01:53.284 --> 01:01:55.994
this hall of course has fallen short

01:01:56.054 --> 01:02:01.382
but in Russia you always have it in big-big huge places

01:02:01.391 --> 01:02:04.391
with sixteen thousand, eighteen thousand

01:02:04.472 --> 01:02:08.061
and they are so much

01:02:08.141 --> 01:02:10.748
I don’t know, endowed with shraddha,

01:02:10.739 --> 01:02:13.898
so much that in the program only they get it.

01:02:13.898 --> 01:02:17.518
Only in the program! I could not understand.

01:02:17.528 --> 01:02:20.289
And they had a meeting of the scientists there,

01:02:20.309 --> 01:02:23.037
about two hundred and fifty scientists came.

01:02:23.057 --> 01:02:25.838
So, I started telling them about science to begin with.

01:02:25.907 --> 01:02:29.157
I said better be on their level at least to talk to them.

01:02:29.177 --> 01:02:32.186
So, one of them got up and said,

01:02:32.202 --> 01:02:35.177
“Mother, don’t tell us about this science, we know everything.

01:02:35.197 --> 01:02:37.657
Now, you tell us the science of God,

01:02:37.637 --> 01:02:38.577
science of Divine.

01:02:38.579 --> 01:02:39.786
You tell us about this.”

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:42.528
I was amazed, look at these Russians!

01:02:42.608 --> 01:02:45.148
So, I found out all these countries

01:02:45.159 --> 01:02:49.444
like Bulgaria, Russia, Romania and all these five countries,

01:02:49.449 --> 01:02:52.444
there the people are like clean slates,

01:02:52.432 --> 01:02:54.242
they have no conditioning,

01:02:54.313 --> 01:02:55.753
they don’t know anything about God,

01:02:55.813 --> 01:02:58.693
they don’t know anything about books, nothing.

01:02:58.742 --> 01:03:00.623
Absolutely, they are not conditioned

01:03:00.612 --> 01:03:02.933
and the way they have achieved this Sahaja Yoga

01:03:02.916 --> 01:03:05.074
I have been really amazed at this.

01:03:05.135 --> 01:03:09.547
Romania I was amazed and I just told them,

01:03:09.565 --> 01:03:14.407
one paper I read – not read, I never read – I told them about one thing

01:03:14.427 --> 01:03:17.894
and the medical, same thing like this, was there

01:03:17.914 --> 01:03:20.364
and they gave me a Doctorate,

01:03:20.385 --> 01:03:24.065
not honorary but real Doctorate, on that knowledge.

01:03:24.061 --> 01:03:25.074
Can you imagine?

01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:27.425
I mean it’s not possible.

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:30.096
First, I didn’t know, I have never known these things,

01:03:30.090 --> 01:03:33.016
so one of my disciples, “Mother, you have become a Doctor!”

01:03:33.021 --> 01:03:35.425
I said, “That I think I have, already.”

01:03:35.443 --> 01:03:37.864
“No, no this is a real Doctorate, real.”

01:03:37.914 --> 01:03:40.101
I said, “Really, how they have done?”

01:03:40.103 --> 01:03:41.762
Such sensitive people

01:03:41.762 --> 01:03:44.041
but this sensitivity comes

01:03:44.043 --> 01:03:47.851
perhaps may be that they were very much oppressed and troubled

01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:52.302
and also, they had no conditioning of anything.

01:03:52.289 --> 01:03:56.373
And it’s very surprising they have no sense of possessiveness.

01:03:56.385 --> 01:03:59.635
Their Government said, “You take your own flats and look after.”

01:03:59.655 --> 01:04:03.335
So, they said, “No, no, no we don’t want. You look after.”

01:04:03.346 --> 01:04:05.766
They said, “All right whatever cars you have given, you take them.”

01:04:05.835 --> 01:04:08.428
“No, no, no, no. What a headache. You better look after.

01:04:08.447 --> 01:04:10.293
What is the use of taking them?

01:04:10.342 --> 01:04:13.668
Because after all when we die it will be left here.”

01:04:13.702 --> 01:04:16.158
So, such unconditioned minds

01:04:16.188 --> 01:04:18.258
and such clean slates I tell you!

01:04:18.288 --> 01:04:21.451
In the same way we are also very much,

01:04:21.447 --> 01:04:24.171
Indians are very much capable,

01:04:24.197 --> 01:04:27.421
very much more capable than they are.

01:04:27.411 --> 01:04:28.911
Once they get it, they get it

01:04:28.981 --> 01:04:31.210
and they can go very deep into it

01:04:31.231 --> 01:04:33.800
because our life is very deep.

01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:36.960
Our, culture is very deep.

01:04:37.050 --> 01:04:40.340
We have had thanks to all the Saints and all the Sufis

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:48.480
and all the incarnations that basically our genes are very good.

01:04:48.501 --> 01:04:52.080
But with Sahaja Yoga you can even change the genes,

01:04:52.090 --> 01:04:53.440
we have shown you.

01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:56.879
You can change the genes also in Sahaja Yoga.

01:04:56.879 --> 01:05:00.039
And we should not accept anybody because he says,

01:05:00.099 --> 01:05:04.273
“His genes are bad, so he should be allowed to be what he is.”

01:05:04.344 --> 01:05:05.563
It’s not that.

01:05:05.634 --> 01:05:09.543
Everything changeable and to say that genes are

01:05:09.614 --> 01:05:13.769
just the cause of your own style,

01:05:13.766 --> 01:05:15.150
it’s not so.

01:05:15.155 --> 01:05:18.059
Because one child will have different genes,

01:05:18.079 --> 01:05:20.050
another child will have another genes

01:05:20.070 --> 01:05:21.820
So how can that be?

01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:23.550
So, it’s not from the parents,

01:05:23.550 --> 01:05:25.510
it’s not from anything,

01:05:25.539 --> 01:05:32.778
circumstances but it is with your own reactions to things that you develop genes.

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:36.428
So, what happens with genes is that

01:05:36.448 --> 01:05:41.192
you become a very, very religious man,

01:05:41.282 --> 01:05:44.815
very religious in the real sense

01:05:44.784 --> 01:05:49.445
Not religion because you pray too much nothing but inside,

01:05:49.465 --> 01:05:51.365
inside you are so religious.

01:05:51.385 --> 01:05:53.611
And religion is what is love,

01:05:53.635 --> 01:05:56.865
love for humanity is religion

01:05:56.876 --> 01:05:58.846
and that becomes so innate

01:05:58.856 --> 01:06:01.456
and so in born and you enjoy.

01:06:01.485 --> 01:06:02.815
you see loving people.

01:06:02.806 --> 01:06:05.318
You enjoy giving your love to others.

01:06:05.335 --> 01:06:07.588
Even those who hate you,

01:06:07.596 --> 01:06:10.438
you love to give them love

01:06:10.454 --> 01:06:14.454
because you think hatred after all is due to ignorance,

01:06:14.503 --> 01:06:18.336
is not because he hates you really but ignorance.

01:06:18.416 --> 01:06:21.996
And you start seeing the whole thing in a very different vision.

01:06:22.061 --> 01:06:25.400
So, I have a great vision of our country

01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:30.178
achieving that en masse emancipation,

01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:33.418
awakening and so let the whole world come here.

01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:37.351
Once, they came just to give us slavery.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:41.921
Now, let them come here to learn what is Divine.

01:06:41.931 --> 01:06:43.851
And you all can do it very well.

01:06:43.862 --> 01:06:45.481
You don’t have to read many books,

01:06:45.481 --> 01:06:46.631
nothing of the kind.

01:06:46.641 --> 01:06:48.302
We don’t give also books to people

01:06:48.362 --> 01:06:49.851
because if you give them books

01:06:49.922 --> 01:06:52.986
they will just become masters of the books

01:06:52.986 --> 01:06:56.300
and will not achieve anything they should go deep down

01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:59.362
First of all, they should be themselves

01:06:59.362 --> 01:07:01.682
completely one with the Divine.

01:07:01.679 --> 01:07:03.741
Otherwise they are not entitled,

01:07:03.755 --> 01:07:05.655
they have no powers.

01:07:05.704 --> 01:07:08.781
When you are not empowered, how will you do the job?

01:07:08.784 --> 01:07:11.561
But for that you don’t have to spend too much time,

01:07:11.594 --> 01:07:14.155
five minutes in the morning, ten minutes in the evening.

01:07:14.215 --> 01:07:16.158
If you can meditate nothing like it

01:07:16.161 --> 01:07:17.820
and you will be surprised

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:20.650
that all your thought process will slow down

01:07:20.681 --> 01:07:24.010
so much so that you can see clearly

01:07:24.070 --> 01:07:27.949
what is right, what is wrong.

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:30.139
What’s going wrong with you also

01:07:30.199 --> 01:07:31.730
because you get self-knowledge.

01:07:31.789 --> 01:07:33.639
And also, with others

01:07:33.690 --> 01:07:36.550
because you develop a new dimension

01:07:36.621 --> 01:07:40.340
which we call as collective consciousness,

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.380
Samuhik Chaitanya,

01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:44.000
collective consciousness.

01:07:44.081 --> 01:07:47.965
Sitting down here you can feel the vibrations of Mr. Clinton.

01:07:48.025 --> 01:07:51.954
or you can feel the vibrations of any person anywhere,

01:07:51.974 --> 01:07:53.513
sitting down here.

01:07:53.545 --> 01:07:56.414
Now if you know how to correct these vibrations,

01:07:56.405 --> 01:07:57.853
your own vibrations,

01:07:57.873 --> 01:08:00.355
you can correct the vibrations of others.

01:08:00.425 --> 01:08:03.996
You can correct the vibrations sitting down here

01:08:04.028 --> 01:08:05.996
of other people who are far away.

01:08:05.989 --> 01:08:08.829
But of course, you can also correct the vibrations

01:08:08.878 --> 01:08:11.396
of people who are with you.

01:08:11.426 --> 01:08:13.856
In your family there are people who are mad,

01:08:13.909 --> 01:08:15.296
You can correct them.

01:08:15.318 --> 01:08:17.460
So, we can have very good families

01:08:17.469 --> 01:08:19.720
and we could have very good marriages.

01:08:19.738 --> 01:08:21.680
It has many dimensions Sahaja Yoga

01:08:21.708 --> 01:08:25.623
but today is the day I want to really thank you all

01:08:25.684 --> 01:08:29.573
the medical science people, and the industrialists,

01:08:29.573 --> 01:08:32.222
that they should now take to Sahaja Yoga

01:08:32.283 --> 01:08:34.659
and make the best of their lives,

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:38.619
lives which are brought in this great country of Yoga

01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:40.750
where you can easily achieve.

01:08:40.819 --> 01:08:43.829
In this country, it is so full of vibrations,

01:08:43.909 --> 01:08:46.556
so full of vibrations, you won’t believe.

01:08:46.636 --> 01:08:48.917
I was coming from London with my husband,

01:08:48.987 --> 01:08:51.029
and I told him, “We have touched India.”

01:08:51.037 --> 01:08:53.859
He said, “How do you know?” I said, “See the vibrations all around.

01:08:53.867 --> 01:08:55.909
It’s only in India you feel these vibrations.”

01:08:55.917 --> 01:08:58.159
So, he went to the pilot just to find out.

01:08:58.167 --> 01:09:01.818
He said, “Sir, only a minute back we touched India.”

01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:04.559
So, this is such a great country you have.

01:09:09.048 --> 01:09:11.544
And if we could just develop that feeling

01:09:11.548 --> 01:09:13.514
that we are Indians

01:09:13.548 --> 01:09:16.018
and it is our responsibility

01:09:16.048 --> 01:09:19.008
to see that our knowledge goes all over

01:09:19.048 --> 01:09:21.192
and let people take advantage of it.

01:09:21.282 --> 01:09:23.221
By that we don’t criticise anyone.

01:09:23.311 --> 01:09:25.742
By that we don’t condemn anybody, as I have told you,

01:09:25.811 --> 01:09:30.803
but we give them the basis of all the knowledge,

01:09:30.823 --> 01:09:36.083
and that, in Sahaja Yoga, you can do it very well.

01:09:36.123 --> 01:09:38.821
I would say that instead of reading the book

01:09:38.837 --> 01:09:41.051
better get your Realisation

01:09:41.059 --> 01:09:42.559
because Kabira himself has said it,

01:09:42.628 --> 01:09:45.691
“Padhi Padhi pundit murakh bhayo,

01:09:45.731 --> 01:09:49.971
pundit bhayo na koye, dhai akshar prem ka,

01:09:50.051 --> 01:09:52.311
seekhe to pundit hoye.”

01:09:52.335 --> 01:09:55.435
Even after studying all books and scriptures a scholar becomes a fool, nobody becomes a scholar.

01:09:55.435 --> 01:09:58.615
Whoever learns two and a half words of love, he becomes a scholar.

01:09:58.634 --> 01:10:00.756
Thank you very much.
