38:49.301 --> 38:52.541
I think it came to me about 35 to 40 years back

38:52.541 --> 38:54.341
I cannot say exactly when

38:55.281 --> 38:56.281
and

38:57.521 --> 38:59.781
the music and these ghazals

39:00.601 --> 39:02.881
all that i remember very well

39:03.481 --> 39:07.181
for a long time when we went to india and all that

39:07.961 --> 39:10.461
it was quite lost i mean i could never see him

39:10.681 --> 39:17.001
but suddendly, once, at the airport i saw him and i was extremly happ to see him there

39:18.021 --> 39:22.301
i have not heared his music for so many days

39:22.801 --> 39:25.961
then he said that i would like to sing to you mother sometimes

39:27.241 --> 39:29.021
again we got lost with him

39:30.021 --> 39:34.361
and then the other day when he got Padma Shri i was so happy

39:35.021 --> 39:36.541
then he left

39:42.961 --> 39:45.761
i was so proud because i know

39:45.921 --> 39:49.681
he had to struggle a lot. All the artists have to struggle a lot

39:50.121 --> 39:52.881
you see financially. otherwise also

39:53.661 --> 39:56.621
the saraswati pujaris have always to suffer

39:56.941 --> 40:00.121
from the neglect of laxmi

40:01.141 --> 40:05.461
and I (INAUDIBLE) very much that such a great artist

40:06.041 --> 40:10.001
and he cannot have his proper rewards

40:11.681 --> 40:16.561
and that was the time when they have startet that the classical music was going down and down and down (a little bit there) there?)

40:16.941 --> 40:20.401
all sort of cheap music was comming up

40:22.941 --> 40:25.221
But i am so happy that he has been recognised

40:25.401 --> 40:29.821
(however how much?) and the great artist who have recognised a long time back

40:30.361 --> 40:31.581
and that

40:32.321 --> 40:34.501
he as such a good name everywhere

40:35.381 --> 40:38.661
he is a very good man very innnocent person

40:39.061 --> 40:43.181
and i hope one day he will come to cabella to give us a music conzert
