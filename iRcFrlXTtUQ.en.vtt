00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.280
It is good that all Sahaja Yogis have come together. When we meet like this,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.280
we can discuss many things of mutual interest

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.360
and tell even small details about them to each other

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:29.360
how to clean yourself as your Mother’s name itself is Nirmala and it contains many powers.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:40.200
The first word is NIH which means not.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.120
Something that actually does not exist but appears to exist, is called Mahamaya (illusion).

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.160
In fact it is not there

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.240
but we feel it exists and this is called Mahamaya

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.920
and the whole world is like that.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.960
It is seen but it is not true:

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.960
if we are trapped into it we feel that it is the only thing we have to live for

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.400
Then we feel that economic conditions are unsatisfactory,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.920
social and domestic (family) conditions are bad,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.640
everything around us is bad and we cannot see anything good.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:34.360
Water on the sea surface is very dirty and turbid.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.080
Many objects are seen floating on it. But if we go deep into the sea

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:47.280
there is so much beauty, wealth and power that we forget that on the surface the water is so bad.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.280
The point is that everything that you see around is illusion.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.760
You must remember first of all it is all nothing.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.240
If you have to establish ‘NIH’ you have to tell yourself,not this

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.880
whenever a thought comes, say “not this

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.880
“not this (ya neti neti vachane nigamor avochus)

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.920
another thought comes, say it is not there.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.920
You have to say this again and again.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.160
You have to say this again and again. Then you will understand the meaning of word ‘NIH’.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.200
The illusion that you see is not just the illusion,

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.200
but there is something beyond that.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.240
However, we have wasted so many years of lives in these illusions

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.160
that we give importance to all that actually does not exist

00:02:52.240 --> 00:03:00.960
and in doing that we have made heaps of sins.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:08.520
We have tried to derive the pleasure from many things.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:21.320
We have received nothing from whatever we have tried to enjoy.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.280
Essentially, it is all nothing – tasteless.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.840
So, the outlook should be,

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.600
it is all that nothing, it is all false. Only Brahma is real the rest all is false

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.480
You have to adopt this view point everywhere in life.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.840
Then you will understand the true meaning of Sahaja Yoga

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.960
What happens with most of the Sahaja Yogis after realisation

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.640
is that they think, “now that we are realised we have Mataji’s blessings.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.080
Then why are we not prosperous?”.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.480
That means they think God is in the prosperity

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.920
Inspite of having our realization why our family conditions do not improve?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.920
Instead, you should think that, inspite of the realization why my temperament (swabhav) has not changed.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.800
Then you’ll realise that my swabhav has not changed

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.440
See, how beautiful is this word ‘Swabhav’ –

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.840
‘Swa’ is Atman i.e. the spirit and bhav is the nature.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.640
Have you become the nature of your Self ?

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.000
If you become your self there is so much beauty within,

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.520
that all that goes on outside would appear like drama

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.560
So long as this witness state

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.840
So long as this witness state is not fully awakened within you,

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:44.080
you have not followed the word ‘NIH’ and also you have not practised it

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:55.160
and even now you become s emotional or egoistical

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:04.040
coercive or submissive and feel sad about it,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.440
then the state of being on ‘NIH’ is at the centre of these extremes.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.000
You are neither in this state nor in that.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.880
This state has to be established

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.240
and it can be best achieved in meditation.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:23.920
Just by following the idea of ‘NIH’ in your life you will become (Nirvichar) thoughtless.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.960
First of all, you should become thoughtless

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:40.400
Once you start jumping on a thought however good or bad it may be,

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:53.960
you go into some sort of inertia and in that state you jump from one thought to another

00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:01.480
. So some people have said that a bad thought should be opposed by a good thought.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.400
In other words if a vehicle or train coming from one direction,

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.880
is pushed back by another one, both will stop somewhere at the centre.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.520
It is good

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.520
but occasionally it can become harmful.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:22.160
A bad thought when put down by a good thought remains suppressed

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:31.680
but it can suddenly come up and it happens with many people.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.960
. They press down their normal thoughts

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:39.720
and always tell themselves that they must be good to others and must be well behaved etc.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.400
These people can sometimes be in trouble

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.160
Suddenly they get exasperated and others cannot understand,

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.360
why these well behaved people are annoyed.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.840
Also they lose their inner peace.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.360
All the beauty within them is destroyed.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.360
So we should be always thoughtless.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.840
Ban all thoughts from your mind

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:11.280
and then you would automatically remain at the centre in the Vilamba.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.960
You must make all efforts

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:22.720
Now you would ask “Mother how can we do anything without thinking?”

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.080
But what are thoughts? They are hollow.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:35.240
In thoughtless state you are one with the God’s power

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:40.520
that is, the drop, which is you, comes in the ocean which is God.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.760
Hence His power also comes to you. Does this finger think?

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.800
Is it not still moving?

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.520
Give your thoughts to God

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.240
and ask Him to think about you.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.720
But it is rather difficult, because you are not thoughtless.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:04.840
Many people say “we have surrendered everything”, but it does not happen

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.080
because they do it only in talking.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.480
Surrendering is not just talking.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.400
When you attain thoughtlessness then surrendering is automatic .

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.560
That is you have stopped thinking.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.960
When you stop thinking you come to the centre.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:24.600
When at the centre, immediately you go into thoughtless awareness, i.e. become one with God’s power

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:33.120
and when you are one with the God’s power, He looks after you

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.040
He takes care of your small things also. You will be amazed.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.560
Sometimes try doing things on your own

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.200
Then you’ll experience “Sankalpa vikalpa karoti” (Man proposes and God disposes).

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.680
If you want to go through a particular way, try doing it.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:58.000
All the countries have tried it and failed.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:10.000
It is worth trying and after that you will realise that what you were doing earlier was wrong.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:17.760
So once you are in thoughtlessness you will get all inspirations, all powers and everything.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:32.000
The idea that you get in thoughtlessness is an inspiration.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:37.160
You will be surprised. Everything will come to you as if on a plate.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:42.440
You are standing to give a speech. Just be thoughtless and start.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:49.160
Although you have never given a speech earlier

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.720
or do not even know how to do it

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.080
or have no special knowledge of any subject

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.520
you will speak so well that others will be astonished how you know so much.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.200
But once you are deep in the thoughtless state,

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.080
all comes from there and not from your brain.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.240
I tell you about Me.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.280
You pray ‘Mother kindly see that such and such happens to me’

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.360
and I do not think about that.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.680
It is amazing. I put all that in the thoughtlessness.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:33.800
All machinery is working there

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.920
Just put it to that machinery and it is all ready.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.320
Allow that machinery, you can call it silent machinery, to work.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.160
silent machinery, to work. You should put all your problems to it.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.520
But it is very difficult for intellectuals

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.240
because their habit is to go on thinking about everything

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:59.120
You should be able to go into thoughtlessness while trying to understand a subject.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.040
All becomes clear automatically

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.760
Research that you are doing should also be in thoughtless state.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.920
Let your hands work while you are thoughtless.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.400
You can do your research extremely well in this way. I tell you many things.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:23.360
I have never read science in my life and know nothing about it. Still I tell you all that.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:27.000
Where does all the knowledge come from? From the thoughtlessness;

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:31.360
I only speak and see all that is going on.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.920
It was all kept ready in that computer which is speaking

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:45.160
If you are not in the thoughtless state you do not use your computer and put your brain on top of it.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:54.240
It is such on old computer and lot of accurate work has been done on it.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:12:00.680
You are bound to make mistakes if you use your own brain and do not consult the computer

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.880
It has no meaning.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:09.600
Thus the solution for all this is the prefix “PRA”. We say PRASHIKSHAN (Enlightened Education) in which we use the suffix PRA.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:14.160
[Ndlr – Whenever prefix “PRA” is used (in Sanskrit, Hindi or Marathi) it means enlightened].

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:21.680
All that happens in the thoughtless state is enlightened and thus is PRA.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:28.520
It is so PRACHANDA (Enormous) – here again it is PRA.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.920
Some other words are PRAKASHIT (brought to light),

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.880
PRADNYA (wise),

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.960
where we use the prefix PRA meaning enlightened.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.880
enlightened. Light never talks.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:47.000
If you switch on the light in the room, the light won’t speak or give you any ideas.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.040
. It would just make everything visible

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.800
Same is about the light of thoughtlessness.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:01.520
That ‘NIH’ is common in all such words like ‘Nirvichar’ (thoughtless),

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.400
Nirvajya (Selfless),

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.040
Nirahankar (egoless),

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.720
Nirakar (formless).

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:12.640
Thus lots of words come from the prefix NIH.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:16.160
You establish it and then you come into Nirvikalpa (doubtless state).

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.840
First become thoughtless and then doubtless (Nirvikalpa).

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:24.240
Then all your doubts go and you know that there is some power that works

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:28.720
It works very fast and is all subtle.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:36.400
is all subtle. You will be amazed how it happens

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.840
This is also about time

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.640
. I never see watch.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:49.920
Sometimes it stops and shows, when the time is 3.00 o’clock in the night

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Just to show others I wind my watch.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.960
But my real watch is in the thoughtlessness.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.600
It is permanently stopped.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.000
If anything is to be done, it takes place at the right time.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:08.440
Then there are no regrets whether it is late or not

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.280
Whatever it may be I am where I am.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:18.520
Yesterday, my car failed but I was relaxing because I wanted to see the stars

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.080
That beauty is not visible in London

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.160
and I wanted to see it. Thus I was enjoying the starlit night.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.800
Others were worried and they started giving vibrations (bandhans)

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.040
I told them, why are you wasting your vibrations?

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.800
See the stars which you do not watch often.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.360
I had to see the beauty in the sky.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.680
Its splendour was spread all over the sky

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:45.680
The sky thought Mataji should see it also because (it thinks) She always Her attention only on Sahaja yogis

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:51.520
I wanted to get down and watch it but I was worried that the Sahaja yogis might think that I am in trouble.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.040
So I was just watching the sky from where I was and enjoying it

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:58.640
In short, you should not be a slave of anything.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:05.800
If you are thoughtless God takes you everywhere as if on his hands.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.960
He makes all arrangements.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.880
He knows everything and there is no need to tell him about anything.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.960
But you must see whether you are in the PRAVAHA (main stream) or not.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.560
You should see if you are in God’s Pravaha

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:26.280
If you are not in it then you are stuck up somewhere on the bank;

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:31.200
then current comes and takes you in, twice or thrice but again you are on the bank.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:36.960
Then you say ‘Mataji, nothing goes smoothly for me’. It won’t. Because you are entangled.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:44.560
Shri Ganesha’s praise that you sing is excellent.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:50.520
It says, PADTA PRAVAHI “flowing in the main stream (Pravaha)” which means enlightened main stream

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:56.680
We should swim in the pravaha. You should not bring your own separate, current in it.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:05.920
Pravaha also means enlightened vehicle. again ,"PRA"..who is enlightened

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:16.200
The Arti of Shri Ganesha also says ‘Nirvani Rakshave’, i.e. protect me when I am dying.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:20.000
You also pray ‘Raksha Raksha Parameshwara’ O God protect me,

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.360
, but you want to protect yourself.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:28.240
Why should, then, God protect you? He says, “let him protect himself.”

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:33.360
Then you have all the sufferings of the world upon you like big mountains.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.000
I feel like laughing.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:43.400
These are all like balloons. They have no meaning

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:47.920
What I want to emphasise is that you must learn to go deep within yourself

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.160
and realise all this in the thoughtlessness then you can become Nirvikalpa (doubtless).

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:56.360
You should attain Nirasaktata – Asaktata means attachments..

00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:00.720
You must have no attachment (Nirasakta). We have here, (India) ‘my son, my daughter’.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.400
In England, it is just the opposite.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.680
There, they are not attached to son or daughter

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.760
They are worried only about themselves.

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:14.000
Son is left to the dogs. They even kill their children.

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:17.600
Some might not believe it but they kill.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:22.920
Each week a mother kills two children. They are so cruel.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:41.920
Here you have this attachment; my son, my daughter, my husband, my house etc., everything is mine and at the end your “self” is left out!

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.880
You should say “Nothing is mine and everything is yours.”

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:59.120
Kabir says “so long as a goat is alive it is bleating ‘main, main’ (I, I)

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:10.680
but when it is slaughtered there is no life left, she realizes that I spent my whole life in saying “main, main”.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.800
Those whom I called mine have turned out to be useless

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:21.280
everybody in the family, in the house – all those whom I considered to be mine have turned out to be useless.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.120
They themselves killed me and ate

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.400
Then it realizes it’s mistake

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:35.760
Then someone creates taut strings of its guts and fixes them on an musical instrument.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:40.240
When these strings are pulled they make a sound “Toohie, Toohie” (you alone are.)

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:47.680
You must become like that.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:56.920
Once you are established in the idea I am nought, I have no existence, then only you will understand the word ‘NIH’.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:05.280
Let us consider the word ‘LA’. It is Lalita’s word.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:08.000
My second name is Lalita.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.960
It is the blessing of Devi.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.600
It is Her weapon

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:21.480
When LA i.e. goddess becomes Lalit or when the Shakti becomes Lalit

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:26.080
which means active that is when the vibrations rise within Her

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:29.160
The waves of vibrations which you are feeling on your palms

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:41.840
that shakti when is activated is Lalita Shakti.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.520
It is full of beauty and love

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.760
Most important is that it is love.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:51.960
When the power of love becomes active, it becomes LA Shakti.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.560
She envelops you from all sides.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:00.640
When she is active, what is the worry?

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.000
What is your power?

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:07.960
Can you make even one fruit from tree?

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.000
Show me if you can convert one fruit on a tree

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:15.320
Leave, fruit, you cannot make even a leaf or a root!

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:19.480
Only ‘LA’ shakti does all the work. The realisation that you have got is also from this power.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:23.080
From this Shakti have emerged ‘MA’ Shakti and ‘NIH’ Shakti.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:28.000
‘NIH’ Shakti is Shri Brahmadeva’s Power Shri Saraswati Shakti.

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:33.360
And in Saraswati Shakti you must attain the qualities of ‘NIH’.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:38.600
Attaining ‘NIH’ is you must attain a state of ANASAKTATA ( complete detachment).

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.320
. You must become completely detached.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.280
‘LA’ shakti has love in it

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:48.840
She relates us to others.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:54.240
Word LA comes in words like LALAM, LAVANYA.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.200
All these words have got prefix LA.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:02.160
When we want a child to stop crying we say LA, LA, LA…..

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:05.560
Word LA has a sweetness of its own

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:09.240
and you should impress others with it.

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:13.760
Should use this Shakti while speaking to others.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:22.120
What should you do when this Shakti the power of love, is spread everywhere in the nature.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:26.880
You should leave all thoughts to the first power because thoughts come from the first power.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:30.680
What should you do in the last power, i.e. LA Shakti?

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:38.840
You should enjoy the bliss of love.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.920
How? By becoming TANMAYA (forgetting yourself).

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.200
Has anyone measured how much one loves others?

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:51.600
We should measure it. How you enjoy it?

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.080
Does it occur to you, how much you love others?

00:21:55.160 --> 00:22:02.720
I always enjoy loving others; feel, how the love is flowing everywhere

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.160
I do not know whether you feel or not.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.680
I cannot understand much about human beings.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:14.840
But I feel how the love is flowing all over. It is so joy giving.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:22.800
Like a musician who forgets himself in his own melodies and feels how his music is flowing everywhere.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:28.360
Similarly love must flow without any interruption. That is, the same as Lalam Shakti,

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:32.480
which is the power of waves of vibrations, i.e. Lalita Shakti.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.680
Therefore, you should first achieve Lalita Shakti.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:41.560
You must first find out how is your attitude towards others.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:49.680
Some people of low category look at others with an idea to steal something or to get some benefit.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:55.800
Like when a thief comes he’ll try to see if there are new shoes lying around. He will steal them.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:23:00.520
Then they come in and try to find out if there are rich people around.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:04.680
Where are their pockets and see if they can find their purse.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:13.160
Then if they see a person in power then they shower praises on them,

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:19.720
try to be friendly with them and try to obtain some gains from them.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:32.440
This is the view point of very low category of people who try to obtain benefit from everyone.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:37.720
There are some, who are interested in finding other people’s faults.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:50.240
I do not know what pleasure they get, but they keep looking for other’s shortcomings.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.320
What are they going to gain from such an attitude?

00:23:53.400 --> 00:24:01.160
This way they become aloof and then suffer.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:04.240
Only man can teach how to invite troubles.

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:07.280
It is not possible for Me.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.960
How glad am I to meet all.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:22.240
(shree mataji speaking in marathi )

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:30.560
You should use Lalam Shakti in such a way

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:37.480
that you should go into thoughtlessness while looking at other person.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:43.320
That person also will then become thoughtless.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:49.440
Hence I ask you to do ‘Bandhan’. It is helpful to do ‘Bandhan’ to ‘NIH’ Shakti and ‘LA’ Shakti

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.920
which is transferring ‘LA’ Shakti into ‘NIH’ Shakti.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.360
I have to tell many people to raise their left side and put to the right.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:07.240
I tell those people to raise their left sides, who are very proud or think they are working very hard or are very busy.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:13.200
It is filling our own love into own five elements.

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:20.040
Love in our hearts or the power of that love from our hearts should be filled

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:28.480
into the power of action as if you are painting with colours on a canvas.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:35.520
When the power of love is filled in the power of action in a person, he becomes extremely loving

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.760
and that love gradually shines

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:44.200
through his behaviours and in his personality and flows to others.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.400
In Marathi it is called SNEHALTE.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:51.280
It makes his every action enjoyable to others.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.960
Such person becomes so alluring

00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:06.280
that you feel relaxed and happy in his company for hours.

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:10.120
So, your love should become enjoyable and winning other people’s hearts.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:18.560
This becomes useful in such a way that we get friends

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.640
and the affection for each other grows.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:28.360
Everyone feels that there is a place where one can get all love and affection.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:34.600
Hence we must cultivate the God’s power of Love.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.960
If we get any thought we must tell ourselves that

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.880
we are throwing dirt in the Ganges of God’s power.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:45.160
With this attitude of mind

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:50.840
our ‘LA’ Shakti the power of love will remain absolutely clean

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:55.040
and we will enjoy that cleanliness.

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:59.880
You should never be critical of others.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.720
If you ask me about some person,

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:07.120
I can only tell you regarding his kundalini and on which chakra he is caught at present or gets frequently caught.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:12.360
I cannot understand anything beyond that; but if someone asks me how he is or how his nature is etc

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:15.080
I cannot understand the question.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:18.440
If one comes to me criticizing someone,

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:22.520
I say ‘what is nature ?’ It is so changing!

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:27.360
River is flowing here. Who can tell where it will be in future?

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.960
You have to see where you stand.

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.360
If you are on this side in the dirt,

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:35.640
you are bound to feel it unusual that the river is flowing here.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:39.960
I see from the side of the ocean so I know where this river will join the sea.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:43.280
Transformation is a continuous process in Sahaja yoga.

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.280
So never brand anybody as useless.

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:55.120
Every person changes and he must change.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.720
The work of Sahaja Yoga is to bring about the change.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:07.760
Those who believe in Sahaja Yoga should never say that such and such person has become useless

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:14.960
Everybody must be given the chance.

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.160
You should try to see where you were, where you reached

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.760
and where the river will go further.

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:26.480
If you think this way you will not only respect yourself but will also respect others.

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:30.400
One who has no respect for himself never respects others.

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:38.680
We must develop ‘Lalam’ Shakti.I cannot adequately describe the joy of it even by writing a book,

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:50.600
because it cannot be expressed through words they are very much inadequate.

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:58.440
In other words if you have to describe smile

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:04.840
you can only tell how the muscles move

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:12.320
but you cannot tell the effects of the smiles.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:17.720
You should allow this power to be effective and develop it with this LALAM Shakti.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:23.240
Man gets a kind of beauty, an elegance and good nature from ‘Lalam’ Shakti.

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:29.440
You must see that this power grows through your speech, behaviour and other activities.

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:35.040
Some person’s annoyance is also pleasant.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:40.200
He gets annoyed in one minute and laughs in second minute.

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:49.520
That sweet and pleasant power is called Lalita Shakti.

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.960
People have completely distorted its idea.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:57.920
They say that it is the power of destruction. But it is not at all correct.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:10.600
This power is extremely beautiful, creative and artistic.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:15.240
Suppose you sow a seed,

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:21.160
then some of its parts get destroyed this is also ‘Lalita’ Shakti.

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.000
But the destruction is very gentle and easy.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:28.200
The seed then grows into a tree that has leaves.

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:32.920
Those leaves also fall, which is again very spontaneous.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:45.120
Then come the flowers.

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:52.560
When the flowers become fruits some of its components fall and then come the fruits.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:58.600
Those fruits are also cut for eating

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:02.720
The taste that you get after eating is also this power.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:05.920
In this way these two powers work.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.880
You should understand that you cannot make any statue without cutting and chopping.

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:16.080
If you understand that this chip-chopping is of the same kind,

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:24.320
you should not feel bad, if you have to do it sometimes.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.080
That is also necessary.

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:34.120
But an artist does it artistically whereas an artless person does it bluntly.

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:38.320
So this power depends on how much art is in you.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.960
Some times you look at a picture and you want to keep looking.

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:46.920
If someone asks you what is so nice in that picture, you cannot express it in words.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.480
You only look at the picture

00:31:54.560 --> 00:32:06.680
Some pictures are such that you become thoughtless just by looking at them.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:12.800
In that thoughtless state you are enjoying the whole pleasure of it, and this state is the very best.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:19.920
Instead of comparing it with something or describing it with similes you should enjoy the bliss of this state, to your hearts’ content.

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:29.680
It is called RASASWAD.

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:35.800
There are no words or no expression to describe it.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:42.200
You have to experience it from within. All should have this experience.

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:45.600
The letter MA is very interesting.

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:48.360
‘MA’ is the word of Mahalakshmi.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:58.520
‘MA’ is the power of Dharma (Righteousness) and also the power of our evolution.

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:17.680
In ‘MA’ Shakti you have to put in effort, assimilate and achieve Mastery.

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:25.600
For example, an artist conceives the idea of his creation with his ‘LA’ Shakti,

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:30.000
he puts it practice with ‘NIH’ Shakti

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:38.240
and then uses ‘MA’ Shakti to bring it in conformity with his idea.

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:45.160
At every stage he checks whether it agrees with his idea and tries to improve, if it does not He does that again and again.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:52.240
This is ‘MA’ Shakti.That is, if something is not good do it again, once, twice and so on.

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:56.160
This job of improving involves efforts.

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.400
We have to improve ourselves also.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:02.040
But for this, the evolution would have been impossible.

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.480
God has to make enormous efforts.

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:16.440
We have to accomplish ‘MA’ Shakti and preserve it.

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:22.600
If it is not done, other two powers fall off,

00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:31.360
because this power is the centre of gravity.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:37.480
So you should be at the centre of gravity, and the centre of gravity is ‘MA’ Shakti of our evolution.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:44.080
Other two powers will become active in you only when you grow along the power of evolution.

00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:52.160
But you must fully understand and develop ‘MA’ Shakti.

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:56.160
You should not only depend on God.

00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:01.240
So long as you are not realized, it is alright to say that if God loves you He should come to you,

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.760
but thereafter you cannot say so.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:09.720
For with ‘MA’ Shakti you have to balance other two powers.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:15.640
In melody you balance the tunes; while painting a picture you bring about the balance of different colours.

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:22.000
Similarly you have to achieve the balance of ‘NIH’ Shakti and ‘LA’ Shakti.

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:27.120
You have to work for attaining this balance.

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:32.280
On many occasions you lose it. A Sahaja Yogi who can maintain it, rises to a very high level.

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:35.760
Very emotional Sahaja Yogi is not good.

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:39.000
Similarly very busy Sahaja Yogi is also not very good.

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:46.080
One should activate one’s power of love and continuously monitor it’s progress.

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:52.240
Suppose I follow certain method but even in that every time I do something different.

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:57.240
You must have seen that every time, I come out with something new, some new method.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.480
If this does not work, try some other thing.

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.240
If that also does not work, do something else.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:06.480
If something cannot enter (the body) through the head, try to enter it through the tail.

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:14.080
Sometimes I tell it with a smile or with a cry or try to explain it lovingly, “It should be like this”.

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:18.360
Nobody should fix his method.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:23.400
You rise in the morning apply vermilion, pay obeisance to Mataji; this is all mechanical.

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.920
It is not a living process.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.400
In a living process, you should find out different new methods.

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.160
I always give the example of the root of a tree.

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:49.240
It penetrates deeper and deeper into the soil circumventing the obstacles. It does not fight with them.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:53.960
[The roots] would not have been able to hold the tree without the obstacles.

00:36:54.040 --> 00:37:05.000
Hence the problems are necessary because you cannot progress without the problems.

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:11.760
The power that teaches you how to overcome these problems is ‘MA Shakti’.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:16.960
Therefore it is ‘MA Shakti’ i.e. Mother’s power.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:23.920
For that first thing required is wisdom.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.360
If someone says that I’ve been doing this in the past so I’ll continue doing it.

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:35.760
For example a person is very mild natured and says, “Mother I am very soft what can I do?”

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:38.200
I tell him to change himself and become a lion.

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:44.400
If some other person is a lion I tell him to become a goat. Otherwise it won’t work.

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.880
You have to change your methods.

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:53.720
Person who cannot change his methods cannot spread Sahaja Yoga

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:57.680
because he sticks to only one way, with which people get bored.

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:02.960
You should find new ways. This is how ‘MA Shakti’ works.

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:06.960
Ladies are expert in it.

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:22.560
They make different recipes every day and the husbands are eager to know the menu.

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:35.000
Thus they do not go to the restaurants but come straight home.Ladies are expert in it.

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:52.200
This is the shakti with which you accomplish your balance and concentration.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:39:11.560
When you take it to the highest state, you get the vibrations flow from your balance and wisdom

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:17.080
They will not flow if you do not have wisdom.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:25.680
Person from whom the maximum vibrations are flowing is a wise person; in fact it is his wisdom that is flowing.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:29.200
On this basis, it can be assessed how great Sahaja Yogi you are.

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:35.000
Even if you pretend to be a great Sahaja yogi, it’ll be shown when you come on my Feet and see that catch on your chakras.

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:38.640
You should know when you are caught that you have lost your balance.

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:41.640
The imbalance shows that MA Shakti is weak in you.

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:49.080
The first letter from any real name Mataji is MA that is mother

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:55.040
and this work has been done only by ‘MA’ shakti within me.

00:39:55.120 --> 00:40:01.800
This was not possible if only ‘LA shakti’ or ‘NIH shakti’ were there.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:07.000
I have come with all the three powers but MA shakti is on top.

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:16.280
You have seen that MA shakti is Mother’s power. It must be proved that She is our Mother

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:20.920
Will you accept if someone comes and says “I am your Mother.” You won’t.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.000
Mother must be proved. What is Mother? We have a place in Her heart

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:31.680
We have every right on Her and She has on us, because She loves us very much.

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:34.080
Her love is absolutely NIRVAJYA (disinterested).

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:42.480
She always wishes well of us and has nothing in Her heart except love for us.

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:50.680
You will have faith in the Mother only if you understand that all that decorates you i.e. your spirit, is in Her.

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:53.560
If your mother is dangerous who will believe in Her?

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:56.400
You should prove all these to others.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:03.920
Sahaja Yogi should be able to do that. Other people should realise that he is a wise person.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.400
For that you need the balance;

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:11.960
the balance between the powers of love and action

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:23.400
and it should be so beautiful that people are influenced by such person without their knowledge

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:26.440
Sahaja Yogi should accomplish it

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:33.920
You think at home how to activate these three powers and use them.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.520
‘NIH’ Shakti should give all beauty and creativity to your homes.

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:45.840
You should device new ways and means of contacting the people.

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:49.560
These powers should be used to propagate Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:58.680
For their proper use your ‘NIH’ Shakti i.e. the power of action should be very strong.

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:04.520
Albeit, you must have main ‘LA’ Shakti that is the power of love.

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:09.720
But LA Shakti is to be activated with ‘NIH’ Shakti.

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:12.720
But if one way does not work, find some other way,

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:19.520
try first red and yellow if it does not suit, take yellow and green and if that also does not help do something else

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:23.400
. It would be wise not to be adamant.

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:26.920
An adamant man cannot do anything in Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.040
All that you want to do is to spread Sahaja Yoga for the wellbeing of human beings.

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.120
Then try different ways.

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:41.120
I always fall a prey to your insistence because if I do not do as per your wishes then you’ll be more obstinate.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.200
So I go along with your wishes.

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:48.080
But sometimes I insist on having my way if I want to go somewhere or do something.

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:52.200
Only occasionally I try to have my way but most of the times I do

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:56.360
as per your wishes because I know that human beings are not like me.

00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:02.360
You can never tell what an obstinate person will do, you should not allow him to go to an extremity like removing his own eyes or nose.

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:05.000
Thus one should not challenge obstinacy of a person.

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:08.360
I know all this from ‘MA’ Shakti.

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:13.520
But you should not insist on particular things.

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:16.440
Mataji does not insist. Whatever is there, you should accept

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:22.480
Whatever you do you should have in mind that you are doing an important work. I have no desire.

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:27.240
There is no ‘LA’ Shakti or ‘NIH’ Shakti or ‘MA’ Shakti within me.

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:29.400
There is nothing.

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.880
I even do not know that I am these powers.

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:38.440
I only witness all the play.

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:53.040
When the life is changed like this there will be ‘Siddha’ Sahaja Yogis (i.e. those who have complete mastery over Sahaja Yoga) among human beings.

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:59.400
So far they have not become siddhas.

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:07.680
(asking in Marathi not to disturb )

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:23.760
You have to achieve the mastery.

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:32.560
. Siddha Sahaja Yogi is the one who becomes completely one with God and wins Him over.

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:36.240
He has to do everything for that.

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:39.680
I am now going away for a year

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:43.640
After that, it is to be seen how and where you use your mastery.

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:49.760
Sometimes I tell you not to do certain things You should not feel bad about that.

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:54.920
You should not feel sorry in ‘MA’ Shakti because I must tell you not to do certain things.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.200
But some people feel bad about it.

00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:03.000
There was a yogi in Mumbai, who used to take others on his feet. I did not know anything about it.

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:08.840
Once one of his disciples came to me. I was unaware that he had disciples of his own.

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:13.920
So I asked him why do you take others on your feet? He felt very bad about it.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.200
. I said that the vibrations of both of you have gone down.

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:20.920
So I said, you should take a promise that you’ll not take anyone on your feet.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.400
That’s why your mastery has decreased.

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:26.480
It is absolutely forbidden to take anyone on your feet.

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:29.200
That is the only solution.

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:35.760
You must remember that you have to become master (Siddha).

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:40.640
All others must accept that you are Siddha

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:45.680
It should be clear to them the very moment they see you that you are Siddha.

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:47.680
You must ensure this.

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:50.680
If it happens everything will be fine.

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:58.080
One day I told you that you should invite your friends and relations for lunch or dinner

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:01.480
or for some function or tell them that you are arranging a big puja.

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:17.160
Also call some Sahaja Yogis on that day and give realization to all your guests.

00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:20.120
If you do this for one year it will be very beneficial.

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:27.160
This is a very beautiful talk, it can be translated into English and distributed.

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:29.040
May God Bless You!
