WEBVTT

00:08.107 --> 00:14.169
It is good that all Sahaja Yogis have come together.

00:14.250 --> 00:22.053
When we meet like this, we can discuss many things of mutual interest

00:22.199 --> 00:27.922
and tell even small details about them to each other

00:28.002 --> 00:31.927
how to clean yourself as your Mother’s name itself is Nirmala

00:32.007 --> 00:36.952
and it contains many powers.

00:37.791 --> 00:41.151
The first word is NIH which means not.

00:41.232 --> 00:47.291
Something that actually does not exist but appears to exist,

00:47.397 --> 00:52.850
is called Mahamaya (illusion).

00:53.109 --> 00:57.984
In fact it is not there but we feel it exists

00:58.584 --> 01:04.200
and this is called Mahamaya and the whole world is like that.

01:04.281 --> 01:07.981
It is seen but it is not true:

01:08.101 --> 01:16.133
if we are trapped into it we feel that it is the only thing we have to live for.

01:16.213 --> 01:21.454
Then we feel that economic conditions are unsatisfactory,

01:21.534 --> 01:27.100
social and domestic (family) conditions are bad,

01:27.181 --> 01:33.127
everything around us is bad and we cannot see anything good.

01:33.208 --> 01:38.849
Water on the sea surface is very dirty and turbid.

01:39.015 --> 01:42.711
Many objects are seen floating on it.

01:42.791 --> 01:49.285
But if we go deep into the sea there is so much beauty, wealth and power

01:49.365 --> 01:54.330
that we forget that on the surface the water is so bad.

01:54.411 --> 02:00.235
The point is that everything that you see around is illusion.

02:00.322 --> 02:03.832
You must remember first of all it is all nothing.

02:03.917 --> 02:10.534
If you have to establish ‘NIH’ you have to tell yourself,

02:10.640 --> 02:15.740
whenever a thought comes, say “not this

02:15.820 --> 02:19.678
(ya neti neti vachane nigamor avochus)

02:19.810 --> 02:24.455
another thought comes, say it is not there.

02:24.536 --> 02:28.902
You have to say this again and again.

02:28.982 --> 02:35.678
Then you will understand the meaning of word ‘NIH’.

02:38.345 --> 02:43.940
The illusion that you see is not just the illusion,

02:45.436 --> 02:49.921
but there is something beyond that.

02:50.127 --> 02:56.270
However, we have wasted so many years of lives in these illusions

02:56.351 --> 03:02.650
that we give importance to all that actually does not exist

03:02.743 --> 03:07.436
and in doing that we have made heaps of sins.

03:07.517 --> 03:13.047
We have tried to derive the pleasure from many things.

03:13.128 --> 03:21.752
We have received nothing from whatever we have tried to enjoy.

03:22.965 --> 03:28.195
Essentially, it is all nothing – tasteless.

03:28.275 --> 03:37.029
So, the outlook should be, it is all that nothing, it is all false.

03:39.177 --> 03:43.770
Only Brahma is real the rest all is false.

03:43.851 --> 03:46.815
You have to adopt this view point everywhere in life.

03:46.896 --> 03:50.037
Then you will understand the true meaning of Sahaja Yoga.

03:50.117 --> 03:53.935
What happens with most of the Sahaja Yogis after realisation, is that they think,

03:54.016 --> 03:57.796
“now that we are realised we have Mataji’s blessings.

03:58.836 --> 04:01.922
Then why are we not prosperous?”.

04:02.348 --> 04:08.508
That means they think God is in the prosperity.

04:08.914 --> 04:14.961
Inspite of having our realization why our family conditions do not improve?

04:15.041 --> 04:20.526
Instead, you should think that, inspite of the realization

04:20.654 --> 04:24.900
why my temperament (swabhav) has not changed.

04:24.981 --> 04:32.247
Then you’ll realise that my swabhav has not changed.

04:32.328 --> 04:36.801
See, how beautiful is this word ‘Swabhav’

04:36.882 --> 04:41.230
– ‘Swa’ is Atman i.e. the spirit and bhav is the nature.

04:41.311 --> 04:44.142
Have you become the nature of your Self ?

04:44.223 --> 04:47.797
If you become your self there is so much beauty within,

04:47.878 --> 04:53.120
that all that goes on outside would appear like drama.

04:53.201 --> 04:58.197
So long as this witness state is not fully awakened within you,

04:58.277 --> 05:01.924
you have not followed the word ‘NIH’ and also you have not practised it.

05:02.005 --> 05:07.395
Suppose you are aware that you have not established ‘NIH’ within you

05:07.476 --> 05:11.145
and even now you become s emotional or egoistical,

05:11.225 --> 05:14.608
coercive or submissive and feel sad about it,

05:14.689 --> 05:18.247
then the state of being on ‘NIH’ is at the centre of these extremes.

05:18.934 --> 05:21.740
You are neither in this state nor in that.

05:21.820 --> 05:26.186
This state has to be established and it can be best achieved in meditation.

05:26.267 --> 05:30.986
Just by following the idea of ‘NIH’ in your life
you will become (Nirvichar) thoughtless.

05:31.067 --> 05:34.240
First of all, you should become thoughtless.

05:34.320 --> 05:37.757
Once you start jumping on a thought
however good or bad it may be,

05:37.837 --> 05:39.874
you go into some sort of inertia

05:39.954 --> 05:42.715
and in that state you jump from one thought to another.

05:42.795 --> 05:49.511
So some people have said that a bad thought
should be opposed by a good thought.

05:49.591 --> 05:55.381
In other words if a vehicle or train coming from one direction,

05:55.461 --> 06:00.963
is pushed back by another one, both
will stop somewhere at the centre.

06:01.043 --> 06:04.831
It is good but occasionally it can become harmful.

06:04.911 --> 06:08.958
A bad thought when put down by a good thought remains suppressed

06:09.038 --> 06:14.011
but it can suddenly come up and it happens with many people.

06:14.092 --> 06:19.345
They press down their normal thoughts and always tell themselves

06:19.426 --> 06:24.030
that they must be good to others and must be well behaved etc.

06:24.110 --> 06:29.451
These people can sometimes be in trouble.

06:29.532 --> 06:36.470
Suddenly they get exasperated and others cannot understand,

06:36.551 --> 06:43.361
why these well behaved people are annoyed.

06:43.826 --> 06:50.132
Also they lose their inner peace.

06:50.358 --> 07:00.987
All the beauty within them is destroyed. So we should be always thoughtless.

07:01.068 --> 07:07.105
Ban all thoughts from your mind

07:07.581 --> 07:14.664
and then you would automatically remain at the centre in the Vilamba.

07:16.043 --> 07:20.476
You must make all efforts. Now you would ask

07:20.562 --> 07:25.079
“Mother how can we do anything without thinking?”

07:26.631 --> 07:31.173
But what are thoughts? They are hollow.

07:31.293 --> 07:35.881
In thoughtless state you are one with the God’s power

07:35.980 --> 07:41.688
that is, the drop, which is you, comes in the ocean which is God.

07:41.768 --> 07:45.423
Hence His power also comes to you.

07:45.503 --> 07:50.026
Does this finger think? Is it not still moving?

07:50.107 --> 07:55.011
Give your thoughts to God and ask Him to think about you.

07:55.110 --> 08:01.327
But it is rather difficult, because you are not thoughtless.

08:01.408 --> 08:06.032
Many people say “we have surrendered everything”,

08:06.113 --> 08:11.488
but it does not happen because they do it only in talking.

08:11.568 --> 08:14.707
Surrendering is not just talking.

08:14.788 --> 08:20.410
When you attain thoughtlessness then surrendering is automatic .

08:20.491 --> 08:23.237
That is you have stopped thinking.

08:23.318 --> 08:26.738
When you stop thinking you come to the centre.

08:26.819 --> 08:32.628
When at the centre, immediately you go into
thoughtless awareness, i.e. become one with God’s power

08:32.709 --> 08:36.695
and when you are one with the God’s power, He looks after you.

08:36.776 --> 08:40.673
He takes care of your small things also. You will be amazed.

08:40.754 --> 08:44.609
Sometimes try doing things on your own.

08:44.690 --> 08:51.861
Then you’ll experience “Sankalpa vikalpa karoti”
(Man proposes and God disposes).

08:51.942 --> 08:57.499
If you want to go through a particular way, try doing it.

08:57.580 --> 09:01.722
All the countries have tried it and failed.

09:01.803 --> 09:06.511
It is worth trying and after that you will realise

09:06.591 --> 09:10.851
that what you were doing earlier was wrong.

09:10.931 --> 09:19.477
So once you are in thoughtlessness you will get all inspirations,

09:19.558 --> 09:24.269
all powers and everything.

09:29.554 --> 09:35.370
The idea that you get in thoughtlessness is an inspiration.

09:35.451 --> 09:38.537
You will be surprised.

09:39.011 --> 09:42.962
Everything will come to you as if on a plate.

09:43.149 --> 09:46.286
You are standing to give a speech.

09:46.366 --> 09:48.402
Just be thoughtless and start.

09:48.489 --> 09:56.016
Although you have never given a speech earlier or do not even know how to do it

09:56.097 --> 10:02.464
or have no special knowledge of any subject, you will speak so well

10:02.545 --> 10:08.348
that others will be astonished how you know so much.

10:08.429 --> 10:12.909
But once you are deep in the thoughtless state,

10:12.990 --> 10:18.205
all comes from there and not from your brain.

10:18.505 --> 10:21.460
I tell you about Me. You pray:

10:21.541 --> 10:26.828
‘Mother kindly see that such and such happens to me’

10:26.909 --> 10:31.126
and I do not think about that.

10:31.206 --> 10:36.331
It is amazing. I put all that in the thoughtlessness.

10:36.412 --> 10:39.674
All machinery is working there. J

10:39.755 --> 10:44.755
ust put it to that machinery and it is all ready.

10:44.836 --> 10:49.164
Allow that machinery, you can call it silent machinery, to work.

10:49.245 --> 10:52.648
You should put all your problems to it.

10:52.729 --> 10:56.616
But it is very difficult for intellectuals

10:56.697 --> 11:01.408
because their habit is to go on thinking about everything.

11:01.489 --> 11:05.915
You should be able to go into thoughtlessness

11:08.268 --> 11:12.363
while trying to understand a subject.

11:12.443 --> 11:15.127
All becomes clear automatically.

11:15.208 --> 11:20.711
Research that you are doing should also be in thoughtless state.

11:20.792 --> 11:25.183
Let your hands work while you are thoughtless.

11:25.264 --> 11:29.477
You can do your research extremely well in this way. I tell you many things.

11:29.665 --> 11:33.407
I have never read science in my life and know nothing about it.

11:33.487 --> 11:38.164
Still I tell you all that. Where does all the knowledge come from?

11:38.245 --> 11:42.667
From the thoughtlessness; I only speak and see all that is going on.

11:42.748 --> 11:45.854
It was all kept ready in that computer which is speaking.

11:45.934 --> 11:48.067
If you are not in the thoughtless state

11:48.147 --> 11:52.861
you do not use your computer and put your brain on top of it.

11:52.948 --> 11:58.510
It is such on old computer and lot of accurate work has been done on it.

11:58.590 --> 12:03.048
You are bound to make mistakes if you use your own brain

12:03.128 --> 12:07.554
and do not consult the computer. It has no meaning.

12:07.747 --> 12:11.296
Thus the solution for all this is the prefix “PRA”.

12:11.376 --> 12:17.924
We say PRASHIKSHAN (Enlightened Education) in which we use the suffix PRA.

12:18.005 --> 12:23.352
[Ndlr – Whenever prefix “PRA” is used (in Sanskrit,
Hindi or Marathi) it means enlightened].

12:23.433 --> 12:28.871
All that happens in the thoughtless state is enlightened
and thus is PRA.

12:28.951 --> 12:33.262
It is so PRACHANDA (Enormous) – here again it is PRA.

12:33.342 --> 12:37.614
Some other words are PRAKASHIT (brought to light),

12:37.695 --> 12:43.047
PRADNYA (wise), where we use the prefix PRA meaning enlightened.

12:43.128 --> 12:47.650
Light never talks. If you switch on the light in the room,

12:47.730 --> 12:51.267
the light won’t speak or give you any ideas.

12:51.347 --> 12:54.552
It would just make everything visible.

12:54.632 --> 13:00.131
Same is about the light of thoughtlessness.

13:00.211 --> 13:06.138
That ‘NIH’ is common in all such words like ‘Nirvichar’ (thoughtless),

13:06.218 --> 13:15.836
Nirvajya (Selfless), Nirahankar (egoless), Nirakar (formless).

13:15.917 --> 13:20.074
Thus lots of words come from the prefix NIH.

13:20.154 --> 13:27.335
You establish it and then you come into Nirvikalpa (doubtless state).

13:27.415 --> 13:33.452
First become thoughtless and then doubtless (Nirvikalpa).

13:33.532 --> 13:39.113
Then all your doubts go and you know that there is some power that works.

13:39.193 --> 13:44.484
It works very fast and is all subtle.
You will be amazed how it happens.

13:44.564 --> 13:48.647
This is also about time. I never see watch.

13:48.727 --> 13:54.582
Sometimes it stops and shows, when the time is 3.00 o’clock.

13:54.662 --> 13:57.930
Just to show others I wind my watch.

13:58.010 --> 14:04.284
But my real watch is in the thoughtlessness.
It is permanently stopped.

14:04.364 --> 14:10.200
If anything is to be done, it takes place at the right time.

14:10.280 --> 14:15.301
Then there are no regrets whether it is late or not.

14:15.382 --> 14:18.094
Whatever it may be I am where I am.

14:18.175 --> 14:24.720
Yesterday, my car failed but I was relaxing
because I wanted to see the stars.

14:24.801 --> 14:29.733
That beauty is not visible in London and I wanted to see it.

14:29.813 --> 14:32.786
Thus I was enjoying the starlit night.

14:32.867 --> 14:37.206
Others were worried and they started giving vibrations (bandhans).

14:37.286 --> 14:40.652
I told them, why are you wasting your vibrations?

14:40.732 --> 14:44.964
See the stars which you do not watch often.
I had to see the beauty in the sky.

14:45.045 --> 14:47.531
Its splendour was spread all over the sky.

14:47.612 --> 14:50.438
The sky thought Mataji should see it also

14:50.519 --> 14:53.602
because (it thinks) She always Her attention only on Sahaja yogis.

14:53.683 --> 14:56.049
I wanted to get down and watch it but I was worried

14:56.130 --> 14:59.247
that the Sahaja yogis might think that I am in trouble.

14:59.328 --> 15:02.448
So I was just watching the sky from where I was and enjoying it.

15:02.529 --> 15:05.426
In short, you should not be a slave of anything.

15:05.507 --> 15:12.391
If you are thoughtless God takes you everywhere as if on his hands.

15:12.618 --> 15:14.685
He makes all arrangements.

15:14.852 --> 15:19.484
He knows everything and there is no need to tell him about anything.

15:19.565 --> 15:23.910
But you must see whether you are in the PRAVAHA (main stream) or not.

15:23.990 --> 15:26.720
You should see if you are in God’s Pravaha.

15:26.800 --> 15:31.651
If you are not in it then you are stuck up somewhere on the bank;

15:31.744 --> 15:35.845
then current comes and takes you in, twice or thrice

15:35.925 --> 15:37.849
but again you are on the bank.

15:37.929 --> 15:42.661
Then you say ‘Mataji, nothing goes smoothly for me’. It won’t.

15:47.428 --> 15:49.619
Because you are entangled.

15:49.699 --> 15:55.097
Shri Ganesha’s praise that you sing is excellent. It says,

15:55.424 --> 15:58.388
PADTA PRAVAHI “flowing in the main stream (Pravaha)”

15:58.468 --> 16:01.678
which means enlightened main stream.

16:01.758 --> 16:04.797
We should swim in the pravaha.

16:04.877 --> 16:08.631
You should not bring your own separate, current in it.

16:08.711 --> 16:11.350
Pravaha also means enlightened vehicle.

16:11.430 --> 16:19.841
The Arti of Shri Ganesha also says ‘Nirvani Rakshave’,
i.e. protect me when I am dying.

16:19.921 --> 16:24.058
You also pray ‘Raksha Raksha Parameshwara’

16:24.138 --> 16:26.935
O God protect me, but you want to protect yourself.

16:27.015 --> 16:33.111
Why should, then, God protect you? He says, “let him protect himself.”

16:33.217 --> 16:39.978
Then you have all the sufferings of the world upon you like big mountains.

16:40.575 --> 16:46.324
I feel like laughing. These are all like balloons. They have no meaning.

16:48.291 --> 16:54.607
What I want to emphasise is that you must learn to go deep within yourself

16:54.688 --> 16:59.837
and realise all this in the thoughtlessness then you can become Nirvikalpa (doubtless).

16:59.918 --> 17:03.246
You should attain Nirasaktata – Asaktata means attachments.

17:03.327 --> 17:05.602
You must have no attachment (Nirasakta).

17:05.683 --> 17:07.902
We have here, (India) ‘my son, my daughter’.

17:07.983 --> 17:09.803
In England, it is just the opposite.

17:09.903 --> 17:14.328
There, they are not attached to son or daughter.

17:14.408 --> 17:17.358
They are worried only about themselves.

17:17.438 --> 17:21.075
Son is left to the dogs. They even kill their children.

17:21.155 --> 17:24.408
Some might not believe it but they kill.

17:24.661 --> 17:28.411
Each week a mother kills two children. They are so cruel.

17:28.731 --> 17:36.676
Here you have this attachment; my son, my daughter, my husband, my house etc.,

17:36.757 --> 17:43.061
everything is mine and at the end your “self” is left out!

17:43.361 --> 17:49.401
You should say “Nothing is mine and everything is yours.”

17:50.205 --> 17:56.524
Kabir says “so long as a goat is alive it is bleating ‘main, main’ (I, I)

17:56.605 --> 18:01.639
but when it is slaughtered there is no life left,

18:01.720 --> 18:05.795
she realizes that I spent my whole life in saying “main, main”.

18:05.876 --> 18:09.601
Those whom I called mine have turned out to be useless

18:13.614 --> 18:19.785
– everybody in the family, in the house –

18:19.955 --> 18:27.230
all those whom I considered to be mine have turned out to be useless.

18:27.357 --> 18:34.439
They themselves killed me and ate. Then it realizes it’s mistake.

18:34.520 --> 18:40.486
Then someone creates taut strings of its guts

18:40.597 --> 18:44.076
and fixes them on an musical instrument.

18:44.157 --> 18:48.096
When these strings are pulled they make a sound “Toohie, Toohie”

18:48.176 --> 18:51.407
(you alone are.) You must become like that.

18:51.488 --> 18:53.933
Once you are established in the idea I am nought, I have no existence,

18:54.014 --> 18:57.841
then only you will understand the word ‘NIH’.

19:01.241 --> 19:05.501
Let us consider the word ‘LA’. It is Lalita’s word.

19:05.628 --> 19:08.294
My second name is Lalita.

19:08.374 --> 19:13.173
It is the blessing of Devi. It is Her weapon.

19:13.294 --> 19:21.425
When LA i.e. goddess becomes Lalit
or when the Shakti becomes Lalit

19:21.579 --> 19:29.555
which means active that is when
the vibrations rise within Her.

19:29.752 --> 19:40.886
The waves of vibrations which you are feeling on
your palms that shakti when is activated is Lalita Shakti.

19:41.007 --> 19:46.141
It is full of beauty and love.

19:46.461 --> 19:53.039
Most important is that it is love. When the power
of love becomes active, it becomes LA Shakti.

19:53.119 --> 19:56.305
She envelops you from all sides.

19:56.391 --> 20:03.265
When she is active, what is the worry? What is your power?

20:03.738 --> 20:06.809
Can you make even one fruit from tree?

20:06.889 --> 20:11.575
Show me if you can convert one fruit on a tree.

20:11.655 --> 20:16.311
Leave, fruit, you cannot make even a leaf or a root!

20:16.391 --> 20:18.666
Only ‘LA’ shakti does all the work.

20:18.747 --> 20:21.797
The realisation that you have got is also from this power.

20:21.878 --> 20:24.757
From this Shakti have emerged ‘MA’ Shakti and ‘NIH’ Shakti.

20:24.838 --> 20:28.251
‘NIH’ Shakti is Shri Brahmadeva’s Power
Shri Saraswati Shakti.

20:28.345 --> 20:33.606
And in Saraswati Shakti you must attain
the qualities of ‘NIH’.

20:33.686 --> 20:39.826
Attaining ‘NIH’ is you must attain a state
of ANASAKTATA ( complete detachment).

20:39.906 --> 20:50.093
You must become completely detached. ‘LA’ shakti
has love in it. She relates us to others.

20:50.255 --> 20:54.434
Word LA comes in words like LALAM, LAVANYA.

20:54.514 --> 20:57.294
All these words have got prefix LA.

20:57.374 --> 21:02.888
When we want a child to stop crying we say LA, LA, LA…..

21:02.968 --> 21:09.444
Word LA has a sweetness of its own and
you should impress others with it.

21:09.524 --> 21:14.175
You should use this Shakti while speaking to others.

21:14.255 --> 21:20.878
What should you do when this Shakti the power
of love, is spread everywhere in the nature.

21:20.958 --> 21:28.551
You should leave all thoughts to the first power
because thoughts come from the first power.

21:28.631 --> 21:33.930
What should you do in the last power, i.e. LA Shakti?

21:34.010 --> 21:38.946
You should enjoy the bliss of love.

21:39.026 --> 21:42.711
How? By becoming TANMAYA (forgetting yourself).

21:42.791 --> 21:47.779
Has anyone measured how much one loves others?

21:48.870 --> 21:51.944
We should measure it. How you enjoy it?

21:52.024 --> 21:55.032
Does it occur to you, how much you love others?

21:55.153 --> 22:00.420
I always enjoy loving others; feel,
how the love is flowing everywhere.

22:00.540 --> 22:07.156
I do not know whether you feel or not.
I cannot understand much about human beings.

22:07.236 --> 22:12.637
But I feel how the love is flowing all over.
It is so joy giving.

22:12.717 --> 22:20.310
Like a musician who forgets himself in his own
melodies and feels how his music is flowing everywhere.

22:20.390 --> 22:24.167
Similarly love must flow without any interruption.

22:24.247 --> 22:32.716
That is, the same as Lalam Shakti, which is the power
of waves of vibrations, i.e. Lalita Shakti.

22:33.283 --> 22:36.527
Therefore, you should first achieve Lalita Shakti.

22:36.648 --> 22:42.015
You must first find out how is your attitude towards others.

22:42.095 --> 22:50.264
Some people of low category look at others with
an idea to steal something or to get some benefit.

22:50.344 --> 22:56.744
Like when a thief comes he’ll try to see if there are
new shoes lying around.

22:56.824 --> 22:58.310
He will steal them.

22:58.390 --> 23:04.752
Then they come in and try to find out if
there are rich people around.

23:04.832 --> 23:09.886
Where are their pockets and see
if they can find their purse.

23:09.966 --> 23:15.380
Then if they see a person in power
then they shower praises on them,

23:15.460 --> 23:20.104
try to be friendly with them and try
to obtain some gains from them.

23:20.184 --> 23:33.328
This is the view point of very low category
of people who try to obtain benefit from everyone.

23:33.408 --> 23:40.009
There are some, who are interested
in finding other people’s faults.

23:40.089 --> 23:47.520
I do not know what pleasure they get,
but they keep looking for other’s shortcomings.

23:47.600 --> 23:54.860
What are they going to gain from such an attitude?

23:56.053 --> 23:59.400
This way they become aloof and then suffer.

24:01.353 --> 24:11.560
Only man can teach how to invite troubles.

24:12.855 --> 24:24.678
It is not possible for Me. How glad am I to meet all.

24:25.991 --> 24:35.740
You should use Lalam Shakti in such a way that you should
go into thoughtlessness while looking at other person.

24:35.820 --> 24:43.585
That person also will then become thoughtless.

24:43.665 --> 24:49.541
Hence I ask you to do ‘Bandhan’. It is helpful
to do ‘Bandhan’ to ‘NIH’ Shakti

24:49.621 --> 24:53.091
and ‘LA’ Shakti which is transferring
‘LA’ Shakti into ‘NIH’ Shakti.

24:53.171 --> 24:59.165
I have to tell many people to raise their left side
and put to the right.

24:59.245 --> 25:03.331
I tell those people to raise their left sides,

25:03.411 --> 25:08.162
who are very proud or think they are working
very hard or are very busy.

25:08.242 --> 25:13.443
It is filling our own love into own five elements.

25:14.170 --> 25:23.827
Love in our hearts or the power of that love
from our hearts should be filled into the power of action

25:23.907 --> 25:29.090
as if you are painting with colours on a canvas.

25:29.211 --> 25:35.531
When the power of love is filled in the power
of action in a person,

25:35.611 --> 25:41.621
he becomes extremely loving and that love
gradually shines through his behaviours

25:41.742 --> 25:44.644
and in his personality and flows to others.

25:44.724 --> 25:51.604
In  Marathi it is called SNEHALTE. It makes
his every action enjoyable to others.

25:51.725 --> 25:59.917
Such person becomes so alluring that you feel
relaxed and happy in his company for hours.

26:00.038 --> 26:11.914
So, your love should become enjoyable and winning
other people’s hearts.

26:12.531 --> 26:20.626
This becomes useful in such a way that we get friends
and the affection for each other grows.

26:22.440 --> 26:29.805
Everyone feels that there is a place where one can get
all love and affection.

26:30.011 --> 26:34.250
Hence we must cultivate the God’s power of Love.

26:34.434 --> 26:44.438
If we get any thought we must tell ourselves
that we are throwing dirt in the Ganges of God’s power.

26:44.559 --> 26:51.105
With this attitude of mind our ‘LA’ Shakti
the power of love will remain absolutely clean

26:51.185 --> 26:54.361
and we will enjoy that cleanliness.

26:54.441 --> 26:57.858
You should never be critical of others.

26:57.979 --> 27:02.009
If you ask me about some person, I can
only tell you regarding his kundalini

27:02.130 --> 27:06.152
and on which chakra he is caught
at present or gets frequently caught.

27:06.232 --> 27:13.415
I cannot understand anything beyond that; but if
someone asks me how he is or how his nature is etc.

27:13.495 --> 27:15.892
I cannot understand the question.

27:15.972 --> 27:22.033
If one comes to me criticizing someone,
I say ‘what is nature ?’ It is so changing!

27:22.154 --> 27:29.839
River is flowing here. Who can tell where
it will be in future? You have to see where you stand.

27:29.919 --> 27:36.717
If you are on this side in the dirt, you are bound
to feel it unusual that the river is flowing here.

27:36.797 --> 27:41.358
I see from the side of the ocean so I know
where this river will join the sea.

27:41.438 --> 27:48.525
Transformation is a continuous process in Sahaja yoga.
So never brand anybody as useless.

27:48.605 --> 27:56.590
Every person changes and he must change.
The work of Sahaja Yoga is to bring about the change.

27:56.670 --> 28:04.537
Those who believe in Sahaja Yoga should never
say that such and such person has become useless.

28:04.617 --> 28:08.939
Everybody must be given the chance.

28:09.491 --> 28:18.000
You should try to see where you were, where
you reached and where the river will go further.

28:18.154 --> 28:26.429
If you think this way you will not only respect
yourself but will also respect others.

28:26.509 --> 28:31.770
One who has no respect for himself never respects others.

28:31.850 --> 28:35.131
We must develop ‘Lalam’ Shakti.

28:35.291 --> 28:46.851
I cannot adequately describe the joy of it even by writing
a book, because it cannot be expressed through words

28:47.084 --> 28:50.584
they are very much inadequate.

28:50.664 --> 28:59.496
In other words if you have to describe smile
you can only tell how the muscles move

28:59.823 --> 29:05.881
but you cannot tell the effects of the smiles.

29:06.916 --> 29:14.742
You should allow this power to be effective
and develop it with this LALAM Shakti.

29:14.842 --> 29:22.047
Man gets a kind of beauty, an elegance
and good nature from ‘Lalam’ Shakti.

29:23.480 --> 29:33.908
You must see that this power grows through
your speech, behaviour and other activities.

29:36.849 --> 29:40.839
Some person’s annoyance is also pleasant.

29:41.086 --> 29:47.140
He gets annoyed in one minute and laughs in second minute.

29:47.809 --> 29:58.408
That sweet and pleasant power is called Lalita Shakti.

29:58.529 --> 30:09.634
People have completely distorted its idea.
They say that it is the power of destruction.

30:09.741 --> 30:14.837
But it is not at all correct. This power is
extremely beautiful, creative and artistic.

30:15.031 --> 30:22.354
Suppose you sow a seed, then some of its
parts get destroyed this is also ‘Lalita’ Shakti.

30:22.522 --> 30:28.038
But the destruction is very gentle and easy.

30:28.172 --> 30:34.855
The seed then grows into a tree that has leaves.

30:35.906 --> 30:41.177
Those leaves also fall, which is again very spontaneous.
Then come the flowers.

30:43.098 --> 30:50.246
When the flowers become fruits some of
its components fall and then come the fruits.

30:50.585 --> 31:02.053
Those fruits are also cut for eating. The taste
that you get after eating is also this power.

31:02.174 --> 31:05.379
In this way these two powers work.

31:05.461 --> 31:13.381
You should understand that you cannot make
any statue without cutting and chopping.

31:13.758 --> 31:20.178
If you understand that this chip-chopping
is of the same kind,

31:20.258 --> 31:25.008
you should not feel bad, if you have to do it sometimes.

31:25.096 --> 31:34.158
That is also necessary. But an artist does it
artistically whereas an artless person does it bluntly.

31:34.238 --> 31:38.785
So this power depends on how much art is in you.

31:38.865 --> 31:46.118
Sometimes you look at a picture and you want to keep looking.

31:46.239 --> 31:52.741
If someone asks you what is so nice in that picture,
you cannot express it in words.

31:53.644 --> 31:57.125
You only look at the picture.

31:57.246 --> 32:01.106
Some pictures are such that you become thoughtless
just by looking at them.

32:01.227 --> 32:06.793
In that thoughtless state you are enjoying
the whole pleasure of it, and this state is the very best.

32:06.873 --> 32:12.853
Instead of comparing it with something
or describing it with similes

32:12.948 --> 32:20.317
you should enjoy the bliss of this state, to your hearts’ content.

32:24.128 --> 32:31.702
It is called RASASWAD. There are no words or no expression to describe it.

32:31.823 --> 32:41.405
You have to experience it from within. All should have this experience.

32:43.157 --> 32:48.751
The letter MA is very interesting. ‘MA’ is the word of Mahalakshmi.

32:48.858 --> 32:58.288
‘MA’ is the power of Dharma (Righteousness)
and also the power of our evolution.

32:58.842 --> 33:06.388
In ‘MA’ Shakti you have to put in effort, assimilate and achieve Mastery.

33:06.509 --> 33:13.156
For example, an artist conceives the idea
of his creation with his ‘LA’ Shakti,

33:13.290 --> 33:23.532
he puts it practice with ‘NIH’ Shakti and then uses
‘MA’ Shakti to bring it in conformity with his idea.

33:24.902 --> 33:36.044
At every stage he checks whether it agrees
with his idea and tries to improve, if it does not.

33:36.197 --> 33:40.752
He does that again and again. This is ‘MA’ Shakti.

33:40.919 --> 33:46.564
That is, if something is not good do it again,
once, twice and so on.

33:46.704 --> 34:04.114
This job of improving involves efforts.
We have to improve ourselves also.

34:04.235 --> 34:10.395
But for this, the evolution would have been impossible.
God has to make enormous efforts.

34:10.516 --> 34:17.237
We have to accomplish ‘MA’ Shakti and preserve it.

34:17.974 --> 34:27.688
If it is not done, other two powers fall off,
because this power is the centre of gravity.

34:28.101 --> 34:40.105
So you should be at the centre of gravity,
and the centre of gravity is ‘MA’ Shakti of our evolution.

34:40.378 --> 34:48.005
Other two powers will become active in you only
when you grow along the power of evolution.

34:48.085 --> 34:56.822
But you must fully understand and develop ‘MA’ Shakti.
You should not only depend on God.

34:56.950 --> 35:06.317
So long as you are not realized, it is alright to say
that if God loves you He should come to you,

35:06.438 --> 35:11.953
but thereafter you cannot say so. For with ‘MA’ Shakti
you have to balance other two powers.

35:12.033 --> 35:17.698
In melody you balance the tunes; while painting a picture
you bring about the balance of different colours.

35:17.778 --> 35:22.325
Similarly you have to achieve the balance
of ‘NIH’ Shakti and ‘LA’ Shakti.

35:22.405 --> 35:27.733
You have to work for attaining this balance.
On many occasions you lose it.

35:27.813 --> 35:32.085
A Sahaja Yogi who can maintain it, rises to a very high level.

35:32.165 --> 35:35.566
Very emotional Sahaja Yogi is not good.

35:35.646 --> 35:40.360
Similarly very busy Sahaja Yogi is also not very good.

35:40.440 --> 35:46.830
One should activate one’s power of love
and continuously monitor it’s progress.

35:46.910 --> 35:52.505
Suppose I follow certain method but even in that
every time I do something different.

35:52.585 --> 35:59.641
You must have seen that every time, I come out
with something new, some new method.

35:59.721 --> 36:05.373
If this does not work, try some other thing.
If that also does not work, do something else.

36:05.453 --> 36:11.471
If something cannot enter (the body) through the head,
try to enter it through the tail.

36:11.551 --> 36:18.287
Sometimes I tell it with a smile or with a cry
or try to explain it lovingly, “It should be like this”.

36:18.367 --> 36:20.300
Nobody should fix his method.

36:20.402 --> 36:23.946
You rise in the morning apply vermilion,
pay obeisance to Mataji;

36:24.026 --> 36:26.572
this is all mechanical. It is not a living process.

36:26.652 --> 36:31.915
In a living process, you should find out different new methods.

36:31.995 --> 36:38.782
I always give the example of the root of a tree.

36:38.862 --> 36:46.564
It penetrates deeper and deeper into the soil
circumventing the obstacles.

36:46.644 --> 36:49.619
It does not fight with them.

36:49.699 --> 36:56.932
[The roots] would not have been able
to hold the tree without the obstacles.

36:57.012 --> 37:05.378
Hence the problems are necessary because
you cannot progress without the problems.

37:05.499 --> 37:12.384
The power that teaches you how to overcome
these problems is ‘MA Shakti’.

37:12.966 --> 37:18.210
Therefore it is ‘MA Shakti’ i.e. Mother’s power.

37:18.780 --> 37:22.675
For that first thing required is wisdom.

37:22.796 --> 37:28.317
If someone says that I’ve been doing this
in the past so I’ll continue doing it.

37:28.437 --> 37:34.334
For example a person is very mild natured
and says, “Mother I am very soft what can I do?”

37:34.455 --> 37:40.201
I tell him to change himself and become a lion.

37:40.322 --> 37:47.081
If some other person is a lion I tell him to become a goat.

37:47.285 --> 37:55.424
Otherwise it won’t work. You have to change your methods.

37:55.584 --> 38:01.776
Person who cannot change his methods
cannot spread Sahaja Yoga

38:01.856 --> 38:07.367
because he sticks to only one way,
with which people get bored.

38:07.488 --> 38:15.610
You should find new ways.
This is how ‘MA Shakti’ works.

38:15.891 --> 38:29.397
Ladies are expert in it. They make different recipes every
day and the husbands are eager to know the menu.

38:29.616 --> 38:36.267
Thus they do not go to the restaurants but come straight home.

38:37.180 --> 38:51.905
This is the shakti with which you accomplish
your balance and concentration.

38:52.130 --> 39:07.031
When you take it to the highest state, you get
the vibrations flow from your balance and wisdom.

39:07.333 --> 39:17.427
They will not flow if you do not have wisdom.

39:19.074 --> 39:22.276
Person from whom the maximum vibrations are

39:22.356 --> 39:26.178
flowing is a wise person;
in fact it is his wisdom that is flowing.

39:26.259 --> 39:30.137
On this basis, it can be assessed
how great Sahaja Yogi you are.

39:30.230 --> 39:34.748
Even if you pretend to be a
great Sahaja yogi, it’ll be shown

39:34.828 --> 39:38.296
when you come on my Feet
and see that catch on your chakras.

39:38.376 --> 39:43.117
You should know when you are caught
that you have lost your balance.

39:43.198 --> 39:46.761
The imbalance shows that MA Shakti is weak in you.

39:46.841 --> 39:51.598
The first letter from any real name Mataji is MA that is mother

39:51.678 --> 39:55.334
and this work has been done only by ‘MA’ shakti within me.

39:55.414 --> 40:03.314
This was not possible if only ‘LA shakti’ or ‘NIH shakti’ were there.

40:03.395 --> 40:07.568
I have come with all the three powers but MA shakti is on top.

40:07.648 --> 40:10.461
You have seen that MA shakti is Mother’s power.

40:10.541 --> 40:14.267
It must be proved that She is our Mother.

40:14.347 --> 40:21.025
Will you accept if someone comes and says
“I am your Mother.” You won’t.

40:21.105 --> 40:22.620
Mother must be proved.

40:22.700 --> 40:23.919
What is Mother?

40:23.999 --> 40:31.370
We have a place in Her heart. We have every right on Her
and She has on us, because She loves us very much.

40:31.450 --> 40:34.025
Her love is absolutely NIRVAJYA (disinterested).

40:34.105 --> 40:40.001
She always wishes well of us and has nothing
in Her heart except love for us.

40:40.082 --> 40:43.471
You will have faith in the Mother only if you under

40:43.551 --> 40:47.681
If your mother is dangerous who will believe in Her?

40:47.761 --> 40:53.802
You should prove all these to others.

40:53.883 --> 40:57.490
Sahaja Yogi should be able to do that.

40:57.571 --> 41:03.465
Other people should realise that he is a wise person.

41:05.298 --> 41:13.202
For that you need the balance; the balance
between the powers of love and action

41:13.282 --> 41:19.393
and it should be so beautiful that people are influenced
by such person without their knowledge.

41:19.473 --> 41:24.228
Sahaja Yogi should accomplish it.

41:24.541 --> 41:30.182
You think at home how to activate these three powers and use them.

41:30.262 --> 41:36.280
‘NIH’ Shakti should give all beauty and creativity to your homes.

41:36.360 --> 41:41.456
You should device new ways and means of contacting the people.

41:41.536 --> 41:47.618
These powers should be used to propagate Sahaja Yoga.

41:47.698 --> 41:56.996
For their proper use your ‘NIH’ Shakti
i.e. the power of action should be very strong.

41:57.096 --> 42:02.467
Albeit, you must have main ‘LA’ Shakti
that is the power of love.

42:02.548 --> 42:08.621
But LA Shakti is to be activated with ‘NIH’ Shakti.

42:08.702 --> 42:11.716
But if one way does not work, find some other way,

42:11.797 --> 42:16.251
try first red and yellow if it does not suit, take yellow and green

42:16.331 --> 42:19.370
and if that also does not help do something else.

42:19.451 --> 42:23.954
It would be wise not to be adamant.
An adamant man cannot do anything in Sahaja Yoga.

42:24.034 --> 42:29.410
All that you want to do is to spread Sahaja Yoga
for the wellbeing of human beings.

42:29.491 --> 42:32.188
Then try different ways.

42:32.269 --> 42:36.260
I always fall a prey to your insistence

42:36.340 --> 42:40.891
because if I do not do as per your
wishes then you’ll be more obstinate.

42:40.972 --> 42:43.434
So I go along with your wishes.

42:43.514 --> 42:49.032
But sometimes I insist on having my way
if I want to go somewhere or do something.

42:49.113 --> 42:54.056
Only occasionally I try to have my way but
most of the times I do as per your wishes

42:54.137 --> 42:57.596
because I know that human beings are not like me.

42:57.677 --> 43:01.780
You can never tell what an obstinate person will do,

43:01.861 --> 43:05.661
you should not allow him to go to an extremity
like removing his own eyes or nose.

43:05.742 --> 43:09.017
Thus one should not challenge obstinacy of a person.

43:09.098 --> 43:13.487
I know all this from ‘MA’ Shakti.
But you should not insist on particular things.

43:13.568 --> 43:16.881
Mataji does not insist.
Whatever is there, you should accept.

43:16.961 --> 43:22.608
Whatever you do you should have in mind
that you are doing an important work.

43:22.688 --> 43:29.462
I have no desire. There is no ‘LA’ Shakti
or ‘NIH’ Shakti or ‘MA’ Shakti within me.

43:29.542 --> 43:38.424
There is nothing. I even do not know
that I am these powers. I only witness all the play.

43:41.219 --> 43:45.735
When the life is changed like this there
will be ‘Siddha’ Sahaja Yogis

43:48.919 --> 43:54.702
(i.e. those who have complete mastery over Sahaja Yoga)
among human beings.

43:55.499 --> 44:03.948
So far they have not become siddhas.

44:25.319 --> 44:28.305
You have to achieve the mastery.

44:28.385 --> 44:33.770
Siddha Sahaja Yogi is the one who becomes
completely one with God and wins Him over.

44:33.850 --> 44:40.035
He has to do everything for that.
I am now going away for a year.

44:40.115 --> 44:43.588
After that, it is to be seen how and
where you use your mastery.

44:43.669 --> 44:47.890
Sometimes I tell you not to do certain things.
You should not feel bad about that.

44:47.971 --> 44:53.116
You should not feel sorry in ‘MA’ Shakti because
I must tell you not to do certain things.

44:53.196 --> 44:56.422
But some people feel bad about it.

44:56.502 --> 45:00.340
There was a yogi in Mumbai, who used
to take others on his feet.

45:00.420 --> 45:04.834
I did not know anything about it.
Once one of his disciples came to me.

45:04.914 --> 45:10.582
I was unaware that he had disciples of his own.
So I asked him why do you take others on your feet?

45:10.662 --> 45:16.278
He felt very bad about it. I said that the
vibrations of both of you have gone down.

45:16.358 --> 45:22.143
So I said, you should take a promise
that you’ll not take anyone on your feet.

45:22.223 --> 45:31.034
That’s why your mastery has decreased.
It is absolutely forbidden to take anyone on your feet.

45:31.114 --> 45:37.045
That is the only solution. You must remember
that you have to become master (Siddha).

45:37.125 --> 45:40.318
All others must accept that you are Siddha.

45:40.398 --> 45:44.905
It should be clear to them the very
moment they see you that you are Siddha.

45:44.985 --> 45:50.999
You must ensure this. If it happens everything will be fine.

45:54.264 --> 46:02.165
One day I told you that you should invite
your friends and relations for lunch or dinner

46:02.245 --> 46:08.922
or for some function or tell them that
you are arranging a big puja.

46:09.002 --> 46:17.019
Also call some Sahaja Yogis on that day
and give realization to all your guests.

46:17.099 --> 46:21.076
If you do this for one year it will be very beneficial.

46:21.156 --> 46:27.065
This is a very beautiful talk, it can be
translated into English and distributed.

46:27.146 --> 46:28.586
May God Bless You!
