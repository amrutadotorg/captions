00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.336
It is good that all Sahaja Yogis have come together. When we meet like this, 

00:00:02.336 --> 00:00:07.306
we can discuss many things of mutual interest 

00:00:07.306 --> 00:00:13.278
and tell even small details about them to each other 

00:00:13.278 --> 00:00:30.258
how to clean yourself as your Mother’s name itself is Nirmala and it contains many powers.

00:00:30.258 --> 00:00:39.232
The first word is NIH which means not. 

00:00:39.232 --> 00:00:45.170
 Something that actually does not exist but appears to exist, is called Mahamaya (illusion).

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.139
 In fact it is not there

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:53.409
 but we feel it exists and this is called Mahamaya 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:56.946
and the whole world is like that.

00:00:56.946 --> 00:01:03.918
It is seen but it is not true:

00:01:04.919 --> 00:01:11.924
 if we are trapped into it we feel that it is the only thing we have to live for

00:01:11.924 --> 00:01:13.459
Then we feel that economic conditions are unsatisfactory

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:16.961
, social and domestic (family) conditions are bad,

00:01:16.961 --> 00:01:22.933
 everything around us is bad and we cannot see anything good. 

00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:33.408
Water on the sea surface is very dirty and turbid.

00:01:33.408 --> 00:01:35.409
 Many objects are seen floating on it. 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:36.877
But if we go deep into the sea

00:01:36.877 --> 00:01:38.877
 there is so much beauty, wealth and power

00:01:38.877 --> 00:01:46.852
 that we forget that on the surface the water is so bad.

00:01:46.852 --> 00:01:50.822
The point is that everything that you see around is illusion. 

00:01:50.822 --> 00:01:56.826
 You must remember first of all it is all nothing.

00:01:56.826 --> 00:02:02.297
If you have to establish ‘NIH’ you have to tell yourself,not this

00:02:02.297 --> 00:02:08.903
whenever a thought comes, say “not this 

00:02:08.903 --> 00:02:14.907
 “not this (ya neti neti vachane nigamor avochus) 

00:02:14.907 --> 00:02:19.978
another thought comes, say it is not there. 

00:02:19.978 --> 00:02:21.980
You have to say this again and again. 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.218
You have to say this again and again. Then you will understand the meaning of word ‘NIH’. 

00:02:28.218 --> 00:02:34.223
The illusion that you see is not just the illusion, 

00:02:34.223 --> 00:02:40.227
but there is something beyond that.

00:02:40.227 --> 00:02:45.265
However, we have wasted so many years of lives in these illusions

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:51.203
 that we give importance to all that actually does not exist

00:02:51.203 --> 00:03:00.010
 and in doing that we have made heaps of sins.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:07.549
 We have tried to derive the pleasure from many things.

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:20.341
We have received nothing from whatever we have tried to enjoy. 

00:03:20.341 --> 00:03:24.329
Essentially, it is all nothing – tasteless.

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:29.852
So, the outlook should be, 

00:03:29.852 --> 00:03:32.331
 it is all that nothing,

00:03:32.331 --> 00:03:35.649
 it is all false. Only Brahma is real the rest all is false

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:38.978
 You have to adopt this view point everywhere in life.

00:03:38.978 --> 00:03:41.532
Then you will understand the true meaning of Sahaja Yoga

00:03:41.532 --> 00:03:45.003
What happens with most of the Sahaja Yogis after realisation

00:03:45.003 --> 00:03:48.445
is that they think, “now that we are realised we have Mataji’s blessings.

00:03:48.445 --> 00:03:50.858
Then why are we not prosperous?”.

00:03:50.858 --> 00:03:54.516
That means they think God is in the prosperity

00:03:54.516 --> 00:04:00.961
 Inspite of having our realization why our family conditions do not improve?   

00:04:00.961 --> 00:04:07.463
Instead, you should think that, inspite of the realization why my temperament (swabhav) has not changed. 

00:04:07.463 --> 00:04:11.826
Then you’ll realise that my swabhav has not changed

00:04:11.826 --> 00:04:14.702
 See, how beautiful is this word ‘Swabhav’ – 

00:04:14.702 --> 00:04:18.672
‘Swa’ is Atman i.e. the spirit and bhav is the nature. 

00:04:18.672 --> 00:04:20.674
Have you become the nature of your Self ? 

00:04:20.674 --> 00:04:27.045
If you become your self there is so much beauty within, 

00:04:27.045 --> 00:04:31.546
that all that goes on outside would appear like drama

00:04:31.546 --> 00:04:33.617
So long as this witness state 

00:04:33.617 --> 00:04:38.505
So long as this witness state is not fully awakened within you,

00:04:38.505 --> 00:04:43.138
 you have not followed the word ‘NIH’ and also you have not practised it

00:04:43.138 --> 00:04:54.701
and even now you become s emotional or egoistical

00:04:54.701 --> 00:05:03.674
coercive or submissive and feel sad about it,

00:05:03.674 --> 00:05:08.639
 then the state of being on ‘NIH’ is at the centre of these extremes.

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:11.614
You are neither in this state nor in that.

00:05:11.614 --> 00:05:14.712
This state has to be established

00:05:14.712 --> 00:05:16.966
and it can be best achieved in meditation.

00:05:16.966 --> 00:05:23.957
 Just by following the idea of ‘NIH’ in your life you will become (Nirvichar) thoughtless.

00:05:23.957 --> 00:05:27.927
First of all, you should become thoughtless

00:05:27.927 --> 00:05:40.370
Once you start jumping on a thought however good or bad it may be,

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:53.914
you go into some sort of inertia and in that state you jump from one thought to another

00:05:53.914 --> 00:06:00.731
. So some people have said that a bad thought should be opposed by a good thought. 

00:06:00.731 --> 00:06:07.367
In other words if a vehicle or train coming from one direction, 

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:10.850
is pushed back by another one, both will stop somewhere at the centre. 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.490
 It is good 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.490
 but occasionally it can become harmful.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:22.103
 A bad thought when put down by a good thought remains suppressed 

00:06:22.103 --> 00:06:31.811
 but it can suddenly come up and it happens with many people. 

00:06:31.811 --> 00:06:33.913
. They press down their normal thoughts

00:06:33.913 --> 00:06:39.684
 and always tell themselves that they must be good to others and must be well behaved etc. 

00:06:39.684 --> 00:06:44.357
 These people can sometimes be in trouble

00:06:44.357 --> 00:06:48.127
Suddenly they get exasperated and others cannot understand,

00:06:48.127 --> 00:06:52.321
 why these well behaved people are annoyed. 

00:06:52.321 --> 00:06:56.792
Also they lose their inner peace.

00:06:56.792 --> 00:07:00.316
All the beauty within them is destroyed. 

00:07:00.316 --> 00:07:03.303
So we should be always thoughtless.

00:07:03.303 --> 00:07:05.805
Ban all thoughts from your mind 

00:07:05.805 --> 00:07:11.222
 and then you would automatically remain at the centre in the Vilamba.

00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:14.254
You must make all efforts

00:07:14.254 --> 00:07:22.685
 Now you would ask “Mother how can we do anything without thinking?”

00:07:22.685 --> 00:07:26.037
But what are thoughts? They are hollow.

00:07:26.037 --> 00:07:33.578
In thoughtless state you are one with the God’s power 

00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:38.820
that is, the drop, which is you, comes in the ocean which is God.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:43.081
 Hence His power also comes to you. Does this finger think?

00:07:43.081 --> 00:07:45.116
Is it not still moving? 

00:07:45.116 --> 00:07:50.001
 Give your thoughts to God

00:07:50.001 --> 00:07:51.484
and ask Him to think about you.

00:07:51.484 --> 00:07:54.246
But it is rather difficult, because you are not thoughtless.

00:07:54.246 --> 00:08:02.087
Many people say “we have surrendered everything”, but it does not happen

00:08:02.087 --> 00:08:06.353
 because they do it only in talking.

00:08:06.353 --> 00:08:08.749
Surrendering is not just talking.

00:08:08.749 --> 00:08:10.360
When you attain thoughtlessness then surrendering is automatic .

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.826
That is you have stopped thinking.

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:17.244
When you stop thinking you come to the centre. 

00:08:17.244 --> 00:08:22.876
When at the centre, immediately you go into thoughtless awareness, i.e. become one with God’s power

00:08:22.876 --> 00:08:31.803
and when you are one with the God’s power, He looks after you

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:35.449
 He takes care of your small things also. You will be amazed.

00:08:35.449 --> 00:08:37.750
 Sometimes try doing things on your own

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.127
 Then you’ll experience “Sankalpa vikalpa karoti” (Man proposes and God disposes). 

00:08:41.127 --> 00:08:46.361
If you want to go through a particular way, try doing it. 

00:08:46.361 --> 00:08:56.678
All the countries have tried it and failed. 

00:08:56.678 --> 00:09:09.553
 It is worth trying and after that you will realise that what you were doing earlier was wrong. 

00:09:09.553 --> 00:09:16.439
So once you are in thoughtlessness you will get all inspirations, all powers and everything.

00:09:16.439 --> 00:09:30.953
The idea that you get in thoughtlessness is an inspiration.

00:09:30.953 --> 00:09:36.044
You will be surprised. Everything will come to you as if on a plate. 

00:09:36.044 --> 00:09:41.301
You are standing to give a speech. Just be thoughtless and start. 

00:09:41.301 --> 00:09:48.057
 Although you have never given a speech earlier

00:09:48.057 --> 00:09:52.660
or do not even know how to do it 

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.964
 or have no special knowledge of any subject

00:09:54.964 --> 00:10:00.943
you will speak so well that others will be astonished how you know so much. 

00:10:00.943 --> 00:10:04.350
But once you are deep in the thoughtless state, 

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:08.222
all comes from there and not from your brain.

00:10:08.222 --> 00:10:14.218
 I tell you about Me.

00:10:14.218 --> 00:10:18.225
 You pray ‘Mother kindly see that such and such happens to me’ 

00:10:18.225 --> 00:10:20.319
 and I do not think about that.

00:10:20.319 --> 00:10:23.640
It is amazing. I put all that in the thoughtlessness. 

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:33.779
All machinery is working there

00:10:33.779 --> 00:10:37.877
 Just put it to that machinery and it is all ready. 

00:10:37.877 --> 00:10:44.266
Allow that machinery, you can call it silent machinery, to work. 

00:10:44.266 --> 00:10:48.117
silent machinery, to work. You should put all your problems to it. 

00:10:48.117 --> 00:10:51.499
 But it is very difficult for intellectuals 

00:10:51.499 --> 00:10:54.197
 because their habit is to go on thinking about everything

00:10:54.197 --> 00:10:58.123
You should be able to go into thoughtlessness while trying to understand a subject.

00:10:58.123 --> 00:11:02.999
 All becomes clear automatically

00:11:02.999 --> 00:11:07.718
 Research that you are doing should also be in thoughtless state.

00:11:07.718 --> 00:11:11.899
 Let your hands work while you are thoughtless.

00:11:11.899 --> 00:11:17.345
You can do your research extremely well in this way. I tell you many things.

00:11:17.345 --> 00:11:23.325
I have never read science in my life and know nothing about it. Still I tell you all that.

00:11:23.325 --> 00:11:26.354
Where does all the knowledge come from? From the thoughtlessness;

00:11:26.354 --> 00:11:31.325
I only speak and see all that is going on.

00:11:31.325 --> 00:11:35.495
It was all kept ready in that computer which is speaking

00:11:35.495 --> 00:11:45.119
If you are not in the thoughtless state you do not use your computer and put your brain on top of it. 

00:11:45.119 --> 00:11:55.406
 It is such on old computer and lot of accurate work has been done on it. 

00:11:55.406 --> 00:11:59.868
You are bound to make mistakes if you use your own brain and do not consult the computer

00:11:59.868 --> 00:12:02.061
It has no meaning. 

00:12:02.061 --> 00:12:10.279
Thus the solution for all this is the prefix “PRA”. We say PRASHIKSHAN (Enlightened Education) in which we use the suffix PRA. 

00:12:10.279 --> 00:12:14.115
[Ndlr – Whenever prefix “PRA” is used (in Sanskrit, Hindi or Marathi) it means enlightened]. 

00:12:14.115 --> 00:12:22.455
All that happens in the thoughtless state is enlightened and thus is PRA.

00:12:22.455 --> 00:12:28.460
It is so PRACHANDA (Enormous) – here again it is PRA.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.892
 Some other words are PRAKASHIT (brought to light), 

00:12:30.892 --> 00:12:33.830
PRADNYA (wise),

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:37.920
where we use the prefix PRA meaning enlightened. 

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.851
enlightened. Light never talks.

00:12:41.851 --> 00:12:46.975
If you switch on the light in the room, the light won’t speak or give you any ideas.

00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:50.011
. It would just make everything visible

00:12:50.011 --> 00:12:55.759
Same is about the light of thoughtlessness. 

00:12:55.759 --> 00:13:02.180
 That ‘NIH’ is common in all such words like ‘Nirvichar’ (thoughtless), 

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.355
Nirvajya (Selfless),

00:13:03.355 --> 00:13:05.985
Nirahankar (egoless),

00:13:05.985 --> 00:13:08.435
 Nirakar (formless). 

00:13:08.435 --> 00:13:12.617
Thus lots of words come from the prefix NIH. 

00:13:12.617 --> 00:13:15.285
 You establish it and then you come into Nirvikalpa (doubtless state). 

00:13:15.285 --> 00:13:20.008
 First become thoughtless and then doubtless (Nirvikalpa).

00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:23.216
Then all your doubts go and you know that there is some power that works

00:13:23.216 --> 00:13:28.694
It works very fast and is all subtle. 

00:13:28.694 --> 00:13:36.364
is all subtle. You will be amazed how it happens

00:13:36.364 --> 00:13:39.798
This is also about time

00:13:39.798 --> 00:13:41.604
. I never see watch. 

00:13:41.604 --> 00:13:49.883
Sometimes it stops and shows, when the time is 3.00 o’clock in the night 

00:13:49.883 --> 00:13:53.971
 Just to show others I wind my watch.

00:13:53.971 --> 00:13:56.071
But my real watch is in the thoughtlessness. 

00:13:56.071 --> 00:13:59.349
It is permanently stopped.

00:13:59.349 --> 00:14:02.973
 If anything is to be done, it takes place at the right time.

00:14:02.973 --> 00:14:08.398
 Then there are no regrets whether it is late or not

00:14:08.398 --> 00:14:11.252
Whatever it may be I am where I am.

00:14:11.252 --> 00:14:18.488
Yesterday, my car failed but I was relaxing because I wanted to see the stars

00:14:18.488 --> 00:14:21.409
 That beauty is not visible in London 

00:14:21.409 --> 00:14:23.918
and I wanted to see it.  Thus I was enjoying the starlit night.

00:14:23.918 --> 00:14:27.764
Others were worried and they started giving vibrations (bandhans)

00:14:27.764 --> 00:14:29.764
 I told them, why are you wasting your vibrations? 

00:14:29.764 --> 00:14:31.764
 See the stars which you do not watch often.

00:14:31.764 --> 00:14:35.317
 I had to see the beauty in the sky.

00:14:35.317 --> 00:14:37.481
Its splendour was spread all over the sky

00:14:37.481 --> 00:14:45.837
 The sky thought Mataji should see it also because (it thinks) She always Her attention only on Sahaja yogis

00:14:45.837 --> 00:14:51.462
 I wanted to get down and watch it but I was worried that the Sahaja yogis might think that I am in trouble.

00:14:51.462 --> 00:14:54.276
 So I was just watching the sky from where I was and enjoying it

00:14:54.276 --> 00:14:58.595
 In short, you should not be a slave of anything.

00:14:58.595 --> 00:15:05.747
If you are thoughtless God takes you everywhere as if on his hands.

00:15:05.747 --> 00:15:07.930
He makes all arrangements. 

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:11.854
 He knows everything and there is no need to tell him about anything. 

00:15:11.854 --> 00:15:15.354
But you must see whether you are in the PRAVAHA (main stream) or not. 

00:15:15.354 --> 00:15:19.535
You should see if you are in God’s Pravaha

00:15:19.535 --> 00:15:26.223
 If you are not in it then you are stuck up somewhere on the bank; 

00:15:26.223 --> 00:15:30.358
 then current comes and takes you in, twice or thrice but again you are on the bank. 

00:15:30.358 --> 00:15:33.660
Then you say ‘Mataji, nothing goes smoothly for me’. 

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.914
 It won’t. Because you are entangled.
 

00:15:34.914 --> 00:15:44.932
Shri Ganesha’s praise that you sing is excellent. 

00:15:44.932 --> 00:15:50.485
 It says, PADTA PRAVAHI “flowing in the main stream (Pravaha)” which means enlightened main stream

00:15:50.485 --> 00:15:56.643
 We should swim in the pravaha. You should not bring your own separate, current in it.

00:15:56.643 --> 00:16:05.899
 Pravaha also means enlightened vehicle. again ,"PRA"..who is enlightened

00:16:05.899 --> 00:16:16.174
The Arti of Shri Ganesha also says ‘Nirvani Rakshave’, i.e. protect me when I am dying. 

00:16:16.174 --> 00:16:19.950
You also pray ‘Raksha Raksha Parameshwara’ O God protect me,

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:22.319
, but you want to protect yourself. 

00:16:22.319 --> 00:16:28.217
Why should, then, God protect you? He says, “let him protect himself.” 

00:16:28.217 --> 00:16:33.333
Then you have all the sufferings of the world upon you like big mountains.

00:16:33.333 --> 00:16:34.679
I feel like laughing. 

00:16:34.679 --> 00:16:43.364
These are all like balloons. They have no meaning

00:16:43.364 --> 00:16:47.893
What I want to emphasise is that you must learn to go deep within yourself 

00:16:47.893 --> 00:16:52.073
 and realise all this in the thoughtlessness then you can become Nirvikalpa (doubtless). 

00:16:52.073 --> 00:16:56.556
You should attain Nirasaktata – Asaktata means attachments..

00:16:56.556 --> 00:17:00.752
 You must have no attachment (Nirasakta). We have here, (India) ‘my son, my daughter’. 

00:17:00.752 --> 00:17:02.189
In England, it is just the opposite.

00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:05.623
 There, they are not attached to son or daughter

00:17:05.623 --> 00:17:07.710
They are worried only about themselves.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:13.961
Son is left to the dogs. They even kill their children.

00:17:13.961 --> 00:17:17.843
Some might not believe it but they kill.  

00:17:17.843 --> 00:17:23.147
Each week a mother kills two children. They are so cruel.

00:17:23.147 --> 00:17:41.885
Here you have this attachment; my son, my daughter, my husband, my house etc., everything is mine and at the end your “self” is left out!

00:17:41.885 --> 00:17:46.826
You should say “Nothing is mine and everything is yours.”

00:17:46.826 --> 00:17:59.082
Kabir says “so long as a goat is alive it is bleating ‘main, main’ (I, I)

00:17:59.082 --> 00:18:10.651
but when it is slaughtered there is no life left, she realizes that I spent my whole life in saying “main, main”. 

00:18:10.651 --> 00:18:13.767
Those whom I called mine have turned out to be useless

00:18:13.767 --> 00:18:21.258
everybody in the family, in the house – all those whom I considered to be mine have turned out to be useless.

00:18:21.258 --> 00:18:24.080
They themselves killed me and ate

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:27.355
Then it realizes it’s mistake

00:18:27.355 --> 00:18:35.934
 Then someone creates taut strings of its guts and fixes them on an musical instrument.

00:18:35.934 --> 00:18:40.204
When these strings are pulled they make a sound “Toohie, Toohie” (you alone are.)

00:18:40.204 --> 00:18:47.650
You must become like that.

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:56.883
Once you are established in the idea I am nought, I have no existence, then only you will understand the word ‘NIH’.
 

00:18:56.883 --> 00:19:05.226
Let us consider the word ‘LA’. It is Lalita’s word. 

00:19:05.226 --> 00:19:07.975
My second name is Lalita. 

00:19:07.975 --> 00:19:09.922
 It is the blessing of Devi. 

00:19:09.922 --> 00:19:12.543
 It is Her weapon

00:19:12.543 --> 00:19:21.783
 When LA i.e. goddess becomes Lalit or when the Shakti becomes Lalit 

00:19:21.783 --> 00:19:26.370
which means active that is when the vibrations rise within Her

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.580
The waves of vibrations which you are feeling on your palms

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:42.137
that shakti when is activated is Lalita Shakti.

00:19:42.137 --> 00:19:44.784
 It is full of beauty and love

00:19:44.784 --> 00:19:48.058
Most important is that it is love.

00:19:48.058 --> 00:19:52.239
When the power of love becomes active, it becomes LA Shakti.

00:19:52.239 --> 00:19:55.851
She envelops you from all sides.

00:19:55.851 --> 00:20:00.901
When she is active, what is the worry? 

00:20:00.901 --> 00:20:02.567
What is your power? 

00:20:02.567 --> 00:20:08.258
Can you make even one fruit from tree? 

00:20:08.258 --> 00:20:11.260
 Show me if you can convert one fruit on a tree

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:15.597
 Leave, fruit, you cannot make even a leaf or a root! 

00:20:15.597 --> 00:20:19.279
Only ‘LA’ shakti does all the work. The realisation that you have got is also from this power. 

00:20:19.279 --> 00:20:23.378
From this Shakti have emerged ‘MA’ Shakti and ‘NIH’ Shakti.

00:20:23.378 --> 00:20:28.285
‘NIH’ Shakti is Shri Brahmadeva’s Power Shri Saraswati Shakti.

00:20:28.285 --> 00:20:33.631
And in Saraswati Shakti you must attain the qualities of ‘NIH’.

00:20:33.631 --> 00:20:37.353
Attaining ‘NIH’ is you must attain a state of ANASAKTATA ( complete detachment).

00:20:37.353 --> 00:20:41.618
. You must become completely detached.

00:20:41.618 --> 00:20:44.364
 ‘LA’ shakti has love in it

00:20:44.364 --> 00:20:49.131
 She relates us to others. 

00:20:49.131 --> 00:20:54.538
 Word LA comes in words like LALAM, LAVANYA.

00:20:54.538 --> 00:20:57.473
 All these words have got prefix LA. 

00:20:57.473 --> 00:21:02.457
When we want a child to stop crying we say LA, LA, LA…..

00:21:02.457 --> 00:21:05.848
Word LA has a sweetness of its own 

00:21:05.848 --> 00:21:09.054
 and you should impress others with it. 

00:21:09.054 --> 00:21:14.037
Should use this Shakti while speaking to others. 

00:21:14.037 --> 00:21:22.385
What should you do when this Shakti the power of love, is spread everywhere in the nature.

00:21:22.385 --> 00:21:26.742
You should leave all thoughts to the first power because thoughts come from the first power. 

00:21:26.742 --> 00:21:30.965
What should you do in the last power, i.e. LA Shakti? 

00:21:30.965 --> 00:21:39.108
 You should enjoy the bliss of love. 

00:21:39.108 --> 00:21:40.269
 How?

00:21:40.269 --> 00:21:42.203
By becoming TANMAYA (forgetting yourself). 

00:21:42.203 --> 00:21:45.489
Has anyone measured how much one loves others? 

00:21:45.489 --> 00:21:52.574
We should measure it.  How you enjoy it? 

00:21:52.574 --> 00:21:54.982
Does it occur to you, how much you love others? 

00:21:54.982 --> 00:22:02.996
 I always enjoy loving others; feel, how the love is flowing everywhere

00:22:02.996 --> 00:22:05.457
I do not know whether you feel or not. 

00:22:05.457 --> 00:22:07.234
 I cannot understand much about human beings.

00:22:07.234 --> 00:22:15.122
But I feel how the love is flowing all over. It is so joy giving. 

00:22:15.122 --> 00:22:23.763
 Like a musician who forgets himself in his own melodies and feels how his music is flowing everywhere. 

00:22:23.763 --> 00:22:27.754
Similarly love must flow without any interruption. That is, the same as Lalam Shakti, 

00:22:27.754 --> 00:22:32.362
which is the power of waves of vibrations, i.e. Lalita Shakti. 

00:22:32.362 --> 00:22:35.980
Therefore, you should first achieve Lalita Shakti.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:41.849
You must first find out how is your attitude towards others.

00:22:41.849 --> 00:22:50.881
Some people of low category look at others with an idea to steal something or to get some benefit.

00:22:50.881 --> 00:22:56.091
Like when a thief comes he’ll try to see if there are new shoes lying around. He will steal them. 

00:22:56.091 --> 00:23:00.797
 Then they come in and try to find out if there are rich people around.

00:23:00.797 --> 00:23:04.946
Where are their pockets and see if they can find their purse. 

00:23:04.946 --> 00:23:13.442
Then if they see a person in power then they shower praises on them,

00:23:13.442 --> 00:23:18.488
 try to be friendly with them and try to obtain some gains from them. 

00:23:18.488 --> 00:23:32.720
This is the view point of very low category of people who try to obtain benefit from everyone.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:38.614
There are some, who are interested in finding other people’s faults.

00:23:38.614 --> 00:23:50.111
I do not know what pleasure they get, but they keep looking for other’s shortcomings.

00:23:50.111 --> 00:23:52.563
 What are they going to gain from such an attitude? 

00:23:52.563 --> 00:24:01.426
This way they become aloof and then suffer. 

00:24:01.426 --> 00:24:04.513
 Only man can teach how to invite troubles. 

00:24:04.513 --> 00:24:07.571
 It is not possible for Me.

00:24:07.571 --> 00:24:11.228
 How glad am I to meet all. 

00:24:11.228 --> 00:24:22.526
(shree mataji speaking in marathi )

00:24:22.526 --> 00:24:30.845
You should use Lalam Shakti in such a way

00:24:30.845 --> 00:24:37.742
 that you should go into thoughtlessness while looking at other person. 

00:24:37.742 --> 00:24:43.593
That person also will then become thoughtless.

00:24:43.593 --> 00:24:44.984
Hence I ask you to do ‘Bandhan’. 

00:24:44.984 --> 00:24:48.219
 It is helpful to do ‘Bandhan’ to ‘NIH’ Shakti and ‘LA’ Shakti 

00:24:48.219 --> 00:24:53.984
 which is transferring ‘LA’ Shakti into ‘NIH’ Shakti.

00:24:53.984 --> 00:24:57.361
I have to tell many people to raise their left side and put to the right. 

00:24:57.361 --> 00:25:07.532
I tell those people to raise their left sides, who are very proud or think they are working very hard or are very busy. 

00:25:07.532 --> 00:25:11.858
 It is filling our own love into own five elements.

00:25:11.858 --> 00:25:28.749
Love in our hearts or the power of that love from our hearts should be filled into the power of action as if you are painting with colours on a canvas.

00:25:28.749 --> 00:25:35.359
 When the power of love is filled in the power of action in a person, he becomes extremely loving 

00:25:35.359 --> 00:25:38.593
and that love gradually shines 

00:25:38.593 --> 00:25:43.504
through his behaviours and in his personality and flows to others.

00:25:43.504 --> 00:25:46.703
 In  Marathi it is called SNEHALTE. 

00:25:46.703 --> 00:25:50.617
 It makes his every action enjoyable to others. 

00:25:50.617 --> 00:25:54.277
Such person becomes so alluring

00:25:54.277 --> 00:26:05.609
that you feel relaxed and happy in his company for hours.

00:26:05.609 --> 00:26:09.445
So, your love should become enjoyable and winning other people’s hearts.

00:26:09.445 --> 00:26:17.899
This becomes useful in such a way that we get friends 

00:26:17.899 --> 00:26:20.603
and the affection for each other grows. 

00:26:20.603 --> 00:26:28.251
 Everyone feels that there is a place where one can get all love and affection.

00:26:28.251 --> 00:26:34.363
Hence we must cultivate the God’s power of Love.

00:26:34.363 --> 00:26:38.051
If we get any thought we must tell ourselves that 

00:26:38.051 --> 00:26:40.023
 we are throwing dirt in the Ganges of God’s power.

00:26:40.023 --> 00:26:44.463
With this attitude of mind 

00:26:44.463 --> 00:26:50.174
our ‘LA’ Shakti the power of love will remain absolutely clean 

00:26:50.174 --> 00:26:54.357
and we will enjoy that cleanliness.

00:26:54.357 --> 00:26:59.212
You should never be critical of others. 

00:26:59.212 --> 00:27:01.161
 If you ask me about some person, 

00:27:01.161 --> 00:27:06.423
 I can only tell you regarding his kundalini and on which chakra he is caught at present or gets frequently caught. 

00:27:06.423 --> 00:27:11.560
I cannot understand anything beyond that; but if someone asks me how he is or how his nature is etc

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.772
 I cannot understand the question.

00:27:14.772 --> 00:27:17.770
 If one comes to me criticizing someone, 

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:21.820
I say ‘what is nature ?’ It is so changing! 

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:27.458
River is flowing here. Who can tell where it will be in future? 

00:27:27.458 --> 00:27:30.031
You have to see where you stand. 

00:27:30.031 --> 00:27:32.448
If you are on this side in the dirt, 

00:27:32.448 --> 00:27:34.345
 you are bound to feel it unusual that the river is flowing here.

00:27:34.345 --> 00:27:39.882
 I see from the side of the ocean so I know where this river will join the sea. 

00:27:39.882 --> 00:27:43.277
 Transformation is a continuous process in Sahaja yoga.

00:27:43.277 --> 00:27:46.288
So never brand anybody as useless. 

00:27:46.288 --> 00:27:55.261
 Every person changes and he must change. 

00:27:55.261 --> 00:27:58.009
 The work of Sahaja Yoga is to bring about the change.

00:27:58.009 --> 00:28:07.771
Those who believe in Sahaja Yoga should never say that such and such person has become useless

00:28:07.771 --> 00:28:14.943
Everybody must be given the chance.

00:28:14.943 --> 00:28:17.962
You should try to see where you were, where you reached 

00:28:17.962 --> 00:28:20.126
and where the river will go further.

00:28:20.126 --> 00:28:26.646
 If you think this way you will not only respect yourself but will also respect others.

00:28:26.646 --> 00:28:29.518
 One who has no respect for himself never respects others.

00:28:29.518 --> 00:28:37.795
We must develop ‘Lalam’ Shakti.I cannot adequately describe the joy of it even by writing a book,

00:28:37.795 --> 00:28:50.138
because it cannot be expressed through words they are very much inadequate. 

00:28:50.138 --> 00:28:57.946
 In other words if you have to describe smile 

00:28:57.946 --> 00:29:03.953
you can only tell how the muscles move

00:29:03.953 --> 00:29:11.455
 but you cannot tell the effects of the smiles. 

00:29:11.455 --> 00:29:15.692
You should allow this power to be effective and develop it with this LALAM Shakti.

00:29:15.692 --> 00:29:21.812
Man gets a kind of beauty, an elegance and good nature from ‘Lalam’ Shakti.

00:29:21.812 --> 00:29:28.977
You must see that this power grows through your speech, behaviour and other activities. 

00:29:28.977 --> 00:29:34.173
Some person’s annoyance is also pleasant.

00:29:34.173 --> 00:29:39.304
He gets annoyed in one minute and laughs in second minute.

00:29:39.304 --> 00:29:49.038
That sweet and pleasant power is called Lalita Shakti. 

00:29:49.038 --> 00:29:52.085
People have completely distorted its idea.

00:29:52.085 --> 00:29:57.036
They say that it is the power of destruction. But it is not at all correct. 

00:29:57.036 --> 00:30:09.734
This power is extremely beautiful, creative and artistic.

00:30:09.734 --> 00:30:14.341
Suppose you sow a seed,

00:30:14.341 --> 00:30:20.475
 then some of its parts get destroyed this is also ‘Lalita’ Shakti.

00:30:20.475 --> 00:30:22.348
But the destruction is very gentle and easy.

00:30:22.348 --> 00:30:27.319
The seed then grows into a tree that has leaves.

00:30:27.319 --> 00:30:32.039
Those leaves also fall, which is again very spontaneous. 

00:30:32.039 --> 00:30:44.250
Then come the flowers.

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:51.678
When the flowers become fruits some of its components fall and then come the fruits.

00:30:51.678 --> 00:30:58.206
Those fruits are also cut for eating

00:30:58.206 --> 00:31:01.853
The taste that you get after eating is also this power.

00:31:01.853 --> 00:31:06.485
In this way these two powers work. 

00:31:06.485 --> 00:31:09.003
You should understand that you cannot make any statue without cutting and chopping.

00:31:09.003 --> 00:31:15.192
If you understand that this chip-chopping is of the same kind,

00:31:15.192 --> 00:31:23.882
 you should not feel bad, if you have to do it sometimes. 

00:31:23.882 --> 00:31:25.218
That is also necessary.

00:31:25.218 --> 00:31:33.238
But an artist does it artistically whereas an artless person does it bluntly.

00:31:33.238 --> 00:31:37.436
 So this power depends on how much art is in you.

00:31:37.436 --> 00:31:42.256
Some times you look at a picture and you want to keep looking. 

00:31:42.256 --> 00:31:45.697
If someone asks you what is so nice in that picture, you cannot express it in words.

00:31:45.697 --> 00:31:47.038
You only look at the picture

00:31:47.038 --> 00:31:52.000
Some pictures are such that you become thoughtless just by looking at them.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:32:06.360
 In that thoughtless state you are enjoying the whole pleasure of it, and this state is the very best.

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:19.032
 Instead of comparing it with something or describing it with similes you should enjoy the bliss of this state, to your hearts’ content. 

00:32:19.032 --> 00:32:28.786
 It is called RASASWAD. 

00:32:28.786 --> 00:32:34.904
There are no words or no expression to describe it.

00:32:34.904 --> 00:32:41.332
You have to experience it from within. All should have this experience.

00:32:41.332 --> 00:32:45.800
The letter MA is very interesting.

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.492
‘MA’ is the word of Mahalakshmi.

00:32:47.492 --> 00:32:57.651
‘MA’ is the power of Dharma (Righteousness) and also the power of our evolution.

00:32:57.651 --> 00:33:16.816
In ‘MA’ Shakti you have to put in effort, assimilate and achieve Mastery.

00:33:16.816 --> 00:33:25.523
 For example, an artist conceives the idea of his creation with his ‘LA’ Shakti, 

00:33:25.523 --> 00:33:29.115
 he puts it practice with ‘NIH’ Shakti 

00:33:29.115 --> 00:33:38.839
and then uses ‘MA’ Shakti to bring it in conformity with his idea.

00:33:38.839 --> 00:33:44.271
At every stage he checks whether it agrees with his idea and tries to improve, if it does not He does that again and again.

00:33:44.271 --> 00:33:51.343
This is ‘MA’ Shakti.That is, if something is not good do it again, once, twice and so on.

00:33:51.343 --> 00:33:55.267
This job of improving involves efforts.

00:33:55.267 --> 00:33:57.768
We have to improve ourselves also.

00:33:57.768 --> 00:34:01.630
But for this, the evolution would have been impossible. 

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:04.347
 God has to make enormous efforts. 

00:34:04.347 --> 00:34:16.303
We have to accomplish ‘MA’ Shakti and preserve it. 

00:34:16.303 --> 00:34:21.734
 If it is not done, other two powers fall off, 

00:34:21.734 --> 00:34:30.774
because this power is the centre of gravity.

00:34:30.774 --> 00:34:36.889
So you should be at the centre of gravity, and the centre of gravity is ‘MA’ Shakti of our evolution.

00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:43.840
Other two powers will become active in you only when you grow along the power of evolution.

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:51.936
But you must fully understand and develop ‘MA’ Shakti. 

00:34:51.936 --> 00:34:55.262
You should not only depend on God.

00:34:55.262 --> 00:35:00.363
So long as you are not realized, it is alright to say that if God loves you He should come to you,

00:35:00.363 --> 00:35:02.897
but thereafter you cannot say so. 

00:35:02.897 --> 00:35:09.452
For with ‘MA’ Shakti you have to balance other two powers. 

00:35:09.452 --> 00:35:14.751
 In melody you balance the tunes; while painting a picture you bring about the balance of different colours.

00:35:14.751 --> 00:35:22.264
Similarly you have to achieve the balance of ‘NIH’ Shakti and ‘LA’ Shakti. 

00:35:22.264 --> 00:35:26.224
You have to work for attaining this balance. 

00:35:26.224 --> 00:35:32.044
On many occasions you lose it. A Sahaja Yogi who can maintain it, rises to a very high level.

00:35:32.044 --> 00:35:35.505
Very emotional Sahaja Yogi is not good. 

00:35:35.505 --> 00:35:39.029
 Similarly very busy Sahaja Yogi is also not very good. 

00:35:39.029 --> 00:35:46.120
One should activate one’s power of love and continuously monitor it’s progress.

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:52.298
Suppose I follow certain method but even in that every time I do something different.

00:35:52.298 --> 00:35:57.510
You must have seen that every time, I come out with something new, some new method.

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:59.522
 If this does not work, try some other thing.

00:35:59.522 --> 00:36:01.332
 If that also does not work, do something else. 

00:36:01.332 --> 00:36:07.227
If something cannot enter (the body) through the head, try to enter it through the tail.

00:36:07.227 --> 00:36:14.126
Sometimes I tell it with a smile or with a cry or try to explain it lovingly, “It should be like this”.

00:36:14.126 --> 00:36:18.393
Nobody should fix his method.

00:36:18.393 --> 00:36:22.772
 You rise in the morning apply vermilion, pay obeisance to Mataji; this is all mechanical.

00:36:22.772 --> 00:36:25.941
 It is not a living process. 

00:36:25.941 --> 00:36:32.204
 In a living process, you should find out different new methods.

00:36:32.204 --> 00:36:34.204
I always give the example of the root of a tree.

00:36:34.204 --> 00:36:49.284
It penetrates deeper and deeper into the soil circumventing the obstacles. It does not fight with them.

00:36:49.284 --> 00:36:53.988
[The roots] would not have been able to hold the tree without the obstacles. 

00:36:53.988 --> 00:37:05.030
Hence the problems are necessary  because you cannot progress without the problems. 

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:11.818
The power that teaches you how to overcome these problems is ‘MA Shakti’. 

00:37:11.818 --> 00:37:17.016
Therefore it is ‘MA Shakti’ i.e. Mother’s power. 

00:37:17.016 --> 00:37:24.517
For that first thing required is wisdom. 

00:37:24.517 --> 00:37:28.390
If someone says that I’ve been doing this in the past so I’ll continue doing it. 

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:35.788
For example a person is very mild natured and says, “Mother I am very soft what can I do?”

00:37:35.788 --> 00:37:38.247
I tell him to change himself and become a lion.

00:37:38.247 --> 00:37:44.428
If some other person is a lion I tell him to become a goat. Otherwise it won’t work. 

00:37:44.428 --> 00:37:46.909
You have to change your methods. 

00:37:46.909 --> 00:37:54.054
 Person who cannot change his methods cannot spread Sahaja Yoga

00:37:54.054 --> 00:37:57.305
because he sticks to only one way, with which people get bored.

00:37:57.305 --> 00:38:04.043
You should find new ways. This is how ‘MA Shakti’ works.

00:38:04.043 --> 00:38:07.016
Ladies are expert in it. 

00:38:07.016 --> 00:38:22.604
They make different recipes every day and the husbands are eager to know the menu. 

00:38:22.604 --> 00:38:35.035
Thus they do not go to the restaurants but come straight home.Ladies are expert in it. 

00:38:35.035 --> 00:38:52.226
This is the shakti with which you accomplish your balance and concentration. 

00:38:52.226 --> 00:39:12.464
 When you take it to the highest state, you get the vibrations flow from your balance and wisdom

00:39:12.464 --> 00:39:16.313
They will not flow if you do not have wisdom. 

00:39:16.313 --> 00:39:25.147
Person from whom the maximum vibrations are flowing is a wise person; in fact it is his wisdom that is flowing. 

00:39:25.147 --> 00:39:29.178
On this basis, it can be assessed how great Sahaja Yogi you are.

00:39:29.178 --> 00:39:34.511
Even if you pretend to be a great Sahaja yogi, it’ll be shown when you come on my Feet and see that catch on your chakras.

00:39:34.511 --> 00:39:38.175
You should know when you are caught that you have lost your balance.

00:39:38.175 --> 00:39:41.687
The imbalance shows that MA Shakti is weak in you. 

00:39:41.687 --> 00:39:49.122
The first letter from any real name Mataji is MA that is mother 

00:39:49.122 --> 00:39:55.069
 and this work has been done only by ‘MA’ shakti within me.

00:39:55.069 --> 00:40:01.828
This was not possible if only ‘LA shakti’ or ‘NIH shakti’ were there.

00:40:01.828 --> 00:40:07.035
 I have come with all the three powers but MA shakti is on top.

00:40:07.035 --> 00:40:17.516
You have seen that MA shakti is Mother’s power. It must be proved that She is our Mother

00:40:17.516 --> 00:40:20.083
Will you accept if someone comes and says “I am your Mother.” You won’t.

00:40:20.083 --> 00:40:26.041
Mother must be proved.
What is Mother?
We have a place in Her heart

00:40:26.041 --> 00:40:32.064
 We have every right on Her and She has on us, because She loves us very much. 

00:40:32.064 --> 00:40:34.113
Her love is absolutely NIRVAJYA (disinterested).

00:40:34.113 --> 00:40:42.502
 She always wishes well of us and has nothing in Her heart except love for us.

00:40:42.502 --> 00:40:51.343
You will have faith in the Mother only if you understand that all that decorates you i.e. your spirit, is in Her.

00:40:51.343 --> 00:40:53.611
If your mother is dangerous who will believe in Her? 

00:40:53.611 --> 00:40:56.453
You should prove all these to others. 

00:40:56.453 --> 00:41:02.732
Sahaja Yogi should be able to do that. Other people should realise that he is a wise person.

00:41:02.732 --> 00:41:07.444
 For that you need the balance; 

00:41:07.444 --> 00:41:11.997
the balance between the powers of love and action 

00:41:11.997 --> 00:41:23.435
and it should be so beautiful that people are influenced by such person without their knowledge

00:41:23.435 --> 00:41:26.488
Sahaja Yogi should accomplish it

00:41:26.488 --> 00:41:33.973
You think at home how to activate these three powers and use them. 

00:41:33.973 --> 00:41:39.553
‘NIH’ Shakti should give all beauty and creativity to your homes. 

00:41:39.553 --> 00:41:45.862
You should device new ways and means of contacting the people.

00:41:45.862 --> 00:41:49.605
These powers should be used to propagate Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:49.605 --> 00:41:58.736
For their proper use your ‘NIH’ Shakti i.e. the power of action should be very strong.

00:41:58.736 --> 00:42:09.271
Albeit, you must have main ‘LA’ Shakti that is the power of love. But LA Shakti is to be activated with ‘NIH’ Shakti.

00:42:09.271 --> 00:42:12.770
But if one way does not work, find some other way, 

00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:18.867
try first red and yellow if it does not suit, take yellow and green and if that also does not help do something else

00:42:18.867 --> 00:42:22.927
. It would be wise not to be adamant. 

00:42:22.927 --> 00:42:26.942
An adamant man cannot do anything in Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:26.942 --> 00:42:32.060
 All that you want to do is to spread Sahaja Yoga for the wellbeing of human beings. 

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:34.152
 Then try different ways. 

00:42:34.152 --> 00:42:40.601
 I always fall a prey to your insistence because if I do not do as per your wishes then you’ll be more obstinate.

00:42:40.601 --> 00:42:43.995
So I go along with your wishes. 

00:42:43.995 --> 00:42:48.122
 But sometimes I insist on having my way if I want to go somewhere or do something.

00:42:48.122 --> 00:42:56.414
Only occasionally I try to have my way but most of the times I do as per your wishes because I know that human beings are not like me.

00:42:56.414 --> 00:43:01.678
You can never tell what an obstinate person will do, you should not allow him to go to an extremity like removing his own eyes or nose. 

00:43:01.678 --> 00:43:05.023
Thus one should not challenge obstinacy of a person.

00:43:05.023 --> 00:43:08.401
I know all this from ‘MA’ Shakti.

00:43:08.401 --> 00:43:13.573
 But you should not insist on particular things.

00:43:13.573 --> 00:43:16.481
Mataji does not insist. Whatever is there, you should accept

00:43:16.481 --> 00:43:21.870
Whatever you do you should have in mind that you are doing an important work. I have no desire.

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:27.276
There is no ‘LA’ Shakti or ‘NIH’ Shakti or ‘MA’ Shakti within me. 

00:43:27.276 --> 00:43:29.440
There is nothing.

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.389
 I even do not know that I am these powers.

00:43:32.389 --> 00:43:38.460
 I only witness all the play.

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:53.087
When the life is changed like this there will be ‘Siddha’ Sahaja Yogis (i.e. those who have complete mastery over Sahaja Yoga) among human beings.

00:43:53.087 --> 00:43:57.056
So far they have not become siddhas. 

00:43:57.056 --> 00:44:07.728
(asking in Marathi  not to disturb )

00:44:07.728 --> 00:44:24.645
 You have to achieve the mastery.

00:44:24.645 --> 00:44:32.618
. Siddha Sahaja Yogi is the one who becomes completely one with God and wins Him over. 

00:44:32.618 --> 00:44:36.273
He has to do everything for that.

00:44:36.273 --> 00:44:39.702
I am now going away for a year

00:44:39.702 --> 00:44:43.662
After that, it is to be seen how and where you use your mastery.

00:44:43.662 --> 00:44:48.330
Sometimes I tell you not to do certain things

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:49.783
You should not feel bad about that.

00:44:49.783 --> 00:44:54.135
 You should not feel sorry in ‘MA’ Shakti because I must tell you not to do certain things.

00:44:54.135 --> 00:44:58.247
But some people feel bad about it. 

00:44:58.247 --> 00:45:01.231
There was a yogi in Mumbai, who used to take others on his feet. 

00:45:01.231 --> 00:45:03.050
I did not know anything about it.

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:08.880
Once one of his disciples came to me. I was unaware that he had disciples of his own. 

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.984
 So I asked him why do you take others on your feet? 

00:45:10.984 --> 00:45:11.936
He felt very bad about it.

00:45:11.936 --> 00:45:17.242
. I said that the vibrations of both of you have gone down.

00:45:17.242 --> 00:45:19.205
 So I said, you should take a promise that you’ll not take anyone on your feet.

00:45:19.205 --> 00:45:23.800
That’s why your mastery has decreased.

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.735
 It is absolutely forbidden to take anyone on your feet.

00:45:25.735 --> 00:45:29.253
That is the only solution.

00:45:29.253 --> 00:45:34.222
You must remember that you have to become master (Siddha). 

00:45:34.222 --> 00:45:40.675
All others must accept that you are Siddha

00:45:40.675 --> 00:45:44.896
 It should be clear to them the very moment they see you that you are Siddha. 

00:45:44.896 --> 00:45:47.727
 You must ensure this. 

00:45:47.727 --> 00:45:50.056
 If it happens everything will be fine.

00:45:50.056 --> 00:45:58.118
One day I told you that you should invite your friends and relations for lunch or dinner

00:45:58.118 --> 00:46:01.537
or for some function or tell them that you are arranging a big puja.

00:46:01.537 --> 00:46:17.201
Also call some Sahaja Yogis on that day and give realization to all your guests.

00:46:17.201 --> 00:46:20.178
If you do this for one year it will be very beneficial.

00:46:20.178 --> 00:46:27.191
This is a very beautiful talk, it can be translated into English and distributed.

00:46:27.191 --> 00:46:28.987
May God Bless You!
