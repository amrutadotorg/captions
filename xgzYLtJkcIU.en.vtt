00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.500
Inside. Because it's very hot and inside, the house is very small.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.820
I hope it works out. You see, I didn't expected so many people would be coming.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.480
So, I think, doesn't matter, we'll see about it.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.160
But, tonight became so cold inside the room. I was really frozen.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.800
For us, Shri Mataji, we sat all day in the sunlight

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.660
and we don't feel hot or anything.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.100
It has been very good.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.620
Dnyaneshwar has written about you people. He's calling you people:

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.560
"Maartanda deta pahina".

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.600
The Surya is the Sun, without any heat in it

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.415
He's discribed Sahaja Yogis:  "Maartanda deta pahina".

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.120
They are like Sun but there is no heat in them.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.820
"Andremadji (unsure) a lajjene"

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:16.200
They are like Moon but there is no, no spots on them.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:24.040
"Lajjene" is a spot, is regarded as a kind of a

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.840
thing you're ashamed of.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.140
So without any spots to be ashamed of

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.135
is the description of a Dnyaneshwar about Sahaja Yogis.

00:02:35.445 --> 00:02:36.815
Wonderful description!

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.220
If you - let it be, let it be, let it be there she wants to be with Me.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.360
Now, don't pull her.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.300
Why do you want to pull her? She's quite all right. Come here!

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.860
Come here, come here!

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.280
She's feeling insulted now. Come, come, come, come.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.420
You are all right. Now, you'll have chana? Come here,

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.480
come! Take some chana. Come!

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.180
All right, come. Come along you come with her otherwise she won't come.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.320
Come along.

00:03:11.015 --> 00:03:12.145
Come, come along.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.040
Hello. Now what do you want to eat?

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.040
You like this?

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.520
Good

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.760
Now, sit down. Sit down.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.940
That is sweet.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.640
Now I have this sweet girl!

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.900
And what's your name?

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.420
Alright, you eat that first.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.480
Is, that is tea?

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.280
This is a special drink of Greece it is neutral "salutaries".

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.580
What's it?

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.640
It's a welcome drink. "Salutaries" mixt with water.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.640
Sour

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.360
Yes.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.360
I'll just keep on Me.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.480
Good.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.720
You're supposed to eat this?

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.560
Are you supposed to eat this?

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.520
So many miracles now, endless.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.840
Yes

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.600
We have this journalist from the national radio here

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.860
Oh, here?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.975
He would like an interview if You agree. They just came.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.460
All right, all right.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.460
Is this all right?

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.520
He told that he wants to do this announcement

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.080
now,

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.680
All right.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.280
about Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.180
Please

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.980
We had this meeting.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.980
So let him have a chair or something.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.640
You have [?] again

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.500
Hello

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.820
Sit down please.

00:07:09.875 --> 00:07:11.675
I did this. Please

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.440
You'll translate.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:27.860
Good.

00:07:29.385 --> 00:07:32.395
I'm sorry I don't know Greek language.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.180
He says that it's-

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.220
Come here.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.480
He says that it's nice that there is somebody that can translate for them.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:05.580
Oh, I see.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:17.040
He has few questions to tell you and then if you want to  say something more,

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.400
whatever you wish.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.600
No, better ask him the questions, it's the best.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:22.200
Yes

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.700
Does he know something about Sahaja Yoga?

00:09:35.425 --> 00:09:37.075
[Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi]

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:55.840
He was informed today by a small target but he -

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.080
I see.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:04.300
So, if you ask Me questions and then I'll tell you, even elaborately  you can ask Me questions.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:29.120
You can energize, he's asking, You can energize a very high energy that is in the universe.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:35.780
And you say that this energy is in a - a round way in man.

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:46.900
You, that of course, have been driven in this inner -

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.700
It's better if I translate. Can I translate for you?

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.700
Nuclear or corus [core].

00:13:11.495 --> 00:13:14.095
Can you put the question clear because.

00:13:14.095 --> 00:13:16.775
Can we make [continues in Greek]

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.695
What is it?

00:13:25.695 --> 00:13:28.685
It's too complicated.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:14:00.820
He says: You are able to mobilize, to make active an energy that's inside us

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:08.160
and it's dormant. When you awakened this energy, what did you find?

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.280
What did you discover?

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:11.780
When You came inside your own

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:17.620
Inside, inside your own Self, your own being, core of being.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.840
What did You find?

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:24.155
What did I find or what anybody else finds.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.020
He wants to know, he wants an answer from you but if you...

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.455
No, I mean what happens to people.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:40.680
To people, OK.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:41.400
No, no he's not asking that.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:49.920
He's actually asking you were the first  saw this energy that You could awaken in people.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.980
When You saw it in Yourself,

00:14:52.535 --> 00:14:55.775
he says, what did You see?

00:15:03.265 --> 00:15:07.760
Because human being cannot see, cannot be aware of this energy, of this power.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:11.480
But You are aware of it and of course, what did You see?

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.100
You see-

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.420
When it, when it all started.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:23.340
My problem is that I must be something. I don't want to talk about Myself so much

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:28.660
Because when Christ talked about himself, you see,

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:31.240
what  he told was the truth, you see,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.420
[Journalist talks at the same time]

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:37.775
When he told it was the truth and he said that he was the Son of God.

00:15:37.775 --> 00:15:39.035
That he was.

00:15:39.375 --> 00:15:40.965
We can prove it also

00:15:41.555 --> 00:15:43.075
But they crucified him.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:48.380
So it's better that I don't talk about Myself so much, what I am.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:53.720
Because to understand Me you have to become a Spirit.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:59.160
You have to become the Self-realized soul,  as a twice-born actually.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:48.400
But still I can tell him that on the fifth of May 1970,

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:58.800
I saw the primordial Kundalini like a telescope opening up

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:04.540
and breaking through your Sahasrara, you see I saw it, the primordial.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:59.560
He says he wants to know more about what exactly is this energy that there is in the universe

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:03.300
and what are the results when it's awakened in someone.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:09.360
You see, this is the All-pervading Power all over about which - [problem with the mike]

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.200
This is an energy.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:36.640
So, this is the All-pervading Power which all the scriptures have talked about,

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:40.500
which is the subtle power which we don't see, we don't feel it.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.940
But it does all the living work.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:49.060
For example,  a seed becomes a tree

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:56.700
and the flowers are there but a rose shoot will produce only roses

00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:00.400
And an orange will produce only orange.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:04.380
All this choice and all this work all living work

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:08.400
even the pulsation of our heart is done by this  All-pervading Power.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.560
Come forward.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.940
He is asking for Your help that he may understand.

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.720
Oh, I see.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:29.300
What are the results of the awakening of  this energy inside the human being?

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.140
All right.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:34.740
Now inside the human being, there is this energy

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.140
residing in the sacrum bone.

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.440
It's a, it's in three and a half coils.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:21:00.300
And because the coils are called as "Kundala"

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.780
in Sanskrit language, it's called as Kundalini.

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:03.280
Yes.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:17.680
Now, this energy is placed dormantly within us,

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.960
but when it is awakened

00:21:20.965 --> 00:21:24.115
it passes through subtle six centres

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:31.120
which are responsible for our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.520
Also in Sanskrit they call it "kendra".

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.700
So, in Sanskrit also they call it "kendra".

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.720
Kendra? Yes, we say kendra in Greek also.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.760
In Sanskrit, there is a similar word for this [she forgets to translate]

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.480
I'm sorry.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.480
He says: "The centre is in the centre."

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:51.920
So what happens, I didn't tell what happens.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:59.820
So, when this energy passes through your six centres

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:04.160
what happens that it nourishes these centres.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:09.120
By the nourishment of these centres, your diseases can get cured, first.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:17.960
Then, if you are mentally upset, you can be cured of your tensions and even schizophrenia and all these things.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:23.280
Then, thirdly, your mental capacity increases.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:28.280
And the fourthly, you feel completely joyous.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:37.040
But the most, people who got Self-realization first feel the Collective Consciousness,

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:41.360
which is described by Jung and many others,

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:46.760
that is All-pervading Power, as cool breeze on their fingertips.

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:47.980
Yes.

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:56.020
Actually, Athena is the Primordial Mother.

00:24:56.020 --> 00:25:00.800
And we call her Adi Shakti or Holy Ghost.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:05.780
And she is reflected within us as the kundalini.

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.700
This is the Primordial Mother.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:30.100
He is asking: "When this energy is not awakened in us

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:34.580
is it functioning at all or not at all?"

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:40.760
It is not functioning and we can see that we are not integrated people.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:47.300
Because if you, if you want to do something from your mind, your heart may say "no".

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:51.060
Your attention will say "no".

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.340
So there's no integration.

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:56.960
And secondly, not only that, that when this energy

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:01.180
is not awakened in a person, the religion which is innate,

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.280
within you,  is not awakened.

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:05.380
So you may follow any religion,

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:09.940
but you can do any sins, all of them are just the same.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.120
They are not righteous people,

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.260
they are not peaceful people.

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:19.060
They talk about it; but it's nothing inside, innate.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.660
The religion, the innate religion

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:26.520
Too much of heat.

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:30.500
Doesn't work.

00:27:40.175 --> 00:27:43.525
Too much pressure of energy.
