00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.500
Inside. Because it's very hot and inside, the house is very small.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.820
I hope it works out. You see, I didn't expected so many people would be coming.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.480
So, I think, doesn't matter, we'll see about it.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.160
But, tonight became so cold inside the room. I was really frozen.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.380
 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.800
For us, Shri Mataji, we sat all day in the sunlight

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.660
and we don't feel hot or anything.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.100
It has been very good.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.620
Dnyaneshwar has written about you people. He's calling you people:

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.560
"Maartanda deta pahina".

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.600
The Surya is the Sun, without any heat in it

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.415
He's discribed Sahaja Yogis:  "Maartanda deta pahina".

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.120
They are like Sun but there is no heat in them.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.820
"Andremadji (unsure) a lajjene"

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:16.200
They are like Moon but there is no, no spots on them.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:24.040
"Lajjene" is a spot, is regarded as a kind of a

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.840
thing you're ashamed of.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.140
So without any spots to be ashamed of

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.135
is the description of a Dnyaneshwar about Sahaja Yogis.

00:02:34.135 --> 00:02:35.135
 

00:02:35.445 --> 00:02:36.815
Wonderful description!

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.220
If you - let it be, let it be, let it be there she wants to be with Me.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.360
Now, don't pull her.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.300
Why do you want to pull her? She's quite all right. Come here!

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.860
Come here, come here!

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.280
She's feeling insulted now. Come, come, come, come.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.420
You are all right. Now, you'll have chana? Come here,

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.480
come! Take some chana. Come!

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.240
 

00:03:02.445 --> 00:03:03.445
 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.180
All right, come. Come along you come with her otherwise she won't come.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.320
Come along.

00:03:11.015 --> 00:03:12.145
Come, come along.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.580

Good.

You can energize, he's asking, You can energize a very high energy that is in the universe.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:35.780
And you say that this energy is in a - a round way in man.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.695
What is it?

00:13:25.695 --> 00:13:28.685
It's too complicated.

00:13:28.685 --> 00:13:31.595
 

00:13:31.595 --> 00:13:34.875

He says: You are able to mobilize, to make active an energy that's inside us

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:08.160
and it's dormant. When you awakened this energy, what did you find?

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.280
What did you discover?

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:11.780
When You came inside your own

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:17.620
Inside, inside your own Self, your own being, core of being.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.840
What did You find?

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:24.155
What did I find or what anybody else finds.

No, I mean what happens to people.

No, no he's not asking that.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:49.920
He's actually asking you were the first  saw this energy that You could awaken in people.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.980
When You saw it in Yourself,

00:14:52.535 --> 00:14:55.775
he says, what did You see?

00:14:55.805 --> 00:14:58.335
 

00:14:58.795 --> 00:14:59.805
 

00:15:00.135 --> 00:15:03.265
 

00:15:03.265 --> 00:15:07.760
Because human being cannot see, cannot be aware of this energy, of this power.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:11.480
But You are aware of it and of course, what did You see?

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.100
You see-

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.420
When it, when it all started.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:23.340
My problem is that I must be something. I don't want to talk about Myself so much

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:28.660
Because when Christ talked about himself, you see,

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:31.240
what  he told was the truth, you see,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.420
[Journalist talks at the same time]

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:37.775
When he told it was the truth and he said that he was the Son of God.

00:15:37.775 --> 00:15:39.035
That he was.

00:15:39.375 --> 00:15:40.965
We can prove it also

00:15:41.555 --> 00:15:43.075
But they crucified him.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:48.380
So it's better that I don't talk about Myself so much, what I am.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:53.720
Because to understand Me you have to become a Spirit.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:59.160
You have to become the Self-realized soul,  as a twice-born actually.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.435
 

00:16:03.435 --> 00:16:06.455
 

00:16:06.875 --> 00:16:09.355
 

00:16:09.355 --> 00:16:12.455
 

00:16:12.455 --> 00:16:14.175
 

00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:17.245
 

00:16:17.245 --> 00:16:18.245
 

00:16:19.125 --> 00:16:21.445
 

00:16:21.445 --> 00:16:24.375
 

00:16:24.375 --> 00:16:26.925
 

00:16:26.925 --> 00:16:29.665
 

00:16:29.665 --> 00:16:30.665
 

00:16:31.085 --> 00:16:33.985
 

00:16:33.985 --> 00:16:36.945
 

00:16:37.225 --> 00:16:39.805
 

00:16:39.805 --> 00:16:42.035
 

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:48.400
But still I can tell him that on the fifth of May 1970,

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:49.480
 

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:58.800
I saw the primordial Kundalini like a telescope opening up

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:04.540
and breaking through your Sahasrara, you see I saw it, the primordial.

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:07.760
 

00:17:07.765 --> 00:17:10.795
 

00:17:10.795 --> 00:17:12.325
 

00:17:12.725 --> 00:17:14.765
 

00:17:15.345 --> 00:17:16.345
 

00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:19.635
 

00:17:19.685 --> 00:17:22.995
 

00:17:23.845 --> 00:17:26.885
 

00:17:26.925 --> 00:17:27.925
 

00:17:29.695 --> 00:17:32.445
 

00:17:33.035 --> 00:17:36.025
 

00:17:36.025 --> 00:17:38.785
 

00:17:38.785 --> 00:17:41.605
 

00:17:41.605 --> 00:17:44.965
 

00:17:44.965 --> 00:17:48.035
 

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.960
 

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:59.560
He says he wants to know more about what exactly is this energy that there is in the universe

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:03.300
and what are the results when it's awakened in someone.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:09.360
You see, this is the All-pervading Power all over about which - [problem with the mike]

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.200
This is an energy.

00:18:26.265 --> 00:18:27.265
 

00:18:28.355 --> 00:18:29.355
 

00:18:29.405 --> 00:18:30.395
 

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:36.640
So, this is the All-pervading Power which all the scriptures have talked about,

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:40.500
which is the subtle power which we don't see, we don't feel it.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.940
But it does all the living work.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:49.060
For example,  a seed becomes a tree

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:56.700
and the flowers are there but a rose shoot will produce only roses

00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:00.400
And an orange will produce only orange.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:04.380
All this choice and all this work all living work

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:08.400
even the pulsation of our heart is done by this  All-pervading Power.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.315
 

00:19:11.315 --> 00:19:13.795
 

00:19:13.795 --> 00:19:16.245
 

00:19:16.245 --> 00:19:18.745
 

00:19:18.745 --> 00:19:21.395
 

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.500
 

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.560
Come forward.

00:19:27.565 --> 00:19:30.555
 

00:19:30.765 --> 00:19:33.665
 

00:19:33.665 --> 00:19:35.195
 

00:19:35.515 --> 00:19:38.445
 

00:19:38.445 --> 00:19:41.285
 

00:19:41.285 --> 00:19:44.685
 

00:19:45.895 --> 00:19:48.985
 

00:19:49.075 --> 00:19:51.685
 

00:19:52.765 --> 00:19:55.835
 

00:19:55.835 --> 00:19:58.745
 

00:19:58.965 --> 00:20:01.605
 

00:20:01.605 --> 00:20:05.015
 

00:20:05.265 --> 00:20:08.365
 

00:20:08.365 --> 00:20:11.555
 

00:20:11.555 --> 00:20:13.595
 

00:20:14.155 --> 00:20:16.965
 

00:20:16.965 --> 00:20:19.280
 

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.940
He is asking for Your help that he may understand.

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.720
Oh, I see.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:29.300
What are the results of the awakening of  this energy inside the human being?

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.140
All right.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:34.740
Now inside the human being, there is this energy

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.140
residing in the sacrum bone.

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.435
 

00:20:40.435 --> 00:20:43.325
 

00:20:43.325 --> 00:20:44.580
 

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.440
It's a, it's in three and a half coils.

00:20:47.925 --> 00:20:50.555
 

00:20:50.555 --> 00:20:53.355
 

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.240
 

00:20:54.680 --> 00:21:00.300
And because the coils are called as "Kundala"

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.780
in Sanskrit language, it's called as Kundalini.

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:03.280
Yes.

00:21:05.065 --> 00:21:07.680
 

00:21:07.765 --> 00:21:09.985
 

00:21:09.985 --> 00:21:12.800
 

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:17.680
Now, this energy is placed dormantly within us,

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.960
but when it is awakened

00:21:20.965 --> 00:21:24.115
it passes through subtle six centres

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:31.120
which are responsible for our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.940
 

00:21:35.065 --> 00:21:38.315
 

00:21:38.315 --> 00:21:41.485
 

00:21:41.485 --> 00:21:44.195
 

00:21:44.195 --> 00:21:47.485
 

00:21:47.485 --> 00:21:50.445
 

00:21:50.445 --> 00:21:53.515
 

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.920
 

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.520
Also in Sanskrit they call it "kendra".

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.700
So, in Sanskrit also they call it "kendra".

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.720
Kendra? Yes, we say kendra in Greek also.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.760
In Sanskrit, there is a similar word for this [she forgets to translate]

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:10.300
 

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.480
I'm sorry.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:17.425
 

00:22:17.425 --> 00:22:18.425
 

00:22:18.495 --> 00:22:21.225
 

00:22:21.225 --> 00:22:24.375
 

00:22:24.375 --> 00:22:26.135
 

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.700
 

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.480
He says: "The centre is in the centre."

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.640
 

00:22:37.155 --> 00:22:39.975
 

00:22:39.975 --> 00:22:42.415
 

00:22:42.885 --> 00:22:46.005
 

00:22:46.005 --> 00:22:47.480
 

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:51.920
So what happens, I didn't tell what happens.

00:22:51.925 --> 00:22:52.925
 

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:54.320
 

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:59.820
So, when this energy passes through your six centres

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:04.160
what happens that it nourishes these centres.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:09.120
By the nourishment of these centres, your diseases can get cured, first.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:17.960
Then, if you are mentally upset, you can be cured of your tensions and even schizophrenia and all these things.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:23.280
Then, thirdly, your mental capacity increases.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:28.280
And the fourthly, you feel completely joyous.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:37.040
But the most, people who got Self-realization first feel the Collective Consciousness,

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:41.360
which is described by Jung and many others,

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:46.760
that is All-pervading Power, as cool breeze on their fingertips.

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:47.980
Yes.

00:23:48.375 --> 00:23:51.365
 

00:23:51.365 --> 00:23:52.795
 

00:23:53.155 --> 00:23:55.345
 

00:23:55.345 --> 00:23:58.045
 

00:23:58.405 --> 00:24:00.475
 

00:24:01.515 --> 00:24:04.225
 

00:24:04.225 --> 00:24:05.785
 

00:24:06.475 --> 00:24:09.555
 

00:24:09.555 --> 00:24:12.385
 

00:24:12.385 --> 00:24:13.915
 

00:24:14.295 --> 00:24:16.735
 

00:24:16.735 --> 00:24:19.785
 

00:24:19.785 --> 00:24:21.535
 

00:24:22.325 --> 00:24:24.405
 

00:24:24.405 --> 00:24:27.475
 

00:24:27.475 --> 00:24:30.525
 

00:24:30.555 --> 00:24:33.005
 

00:24:33.005 --> 00:24:35.135
 

00:24:35.595 --> 00:24:36.975
 

00:24:37.515 --> 00:24:40.205
 

00:24:40.205 --> 00:24:43.355
 

00:24:43.355 --> 00:24:46.395
 

00:24:46.395 --> 00:24:49.155
 

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.680
 

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:56.020
Actually, Athena is the Primordial Mother.

00:24:56.020 --> 00:25:00.800
And we call her Adi Shakti or Holy Ghost.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:05.780
And she is reflected within us as the kundalini.

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:09.215
 

00:25:09.215 --> 00:25:12.235
 

00:25:12.235 --> 00:25:14.525
 

00:25:14.525 --> 00:25:17.375
 

00:25:17.375 --> 00:25:19.525
 

00:25:19.525 --> 00:25:21.885
 

00:25:21.885 --> 00:25:24.835
 

00:25:24.835 --> 00:25:27.815
 

00:25:27.815 --> 00:25:29.785
 

00:25:30.125 --> 00:25:31.235
 

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:34.900
 

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.700
This is the Primordial Mother.

00:25:37.705 --> 00:25:40.655
 

00:25:41.605 --> 00:25:44.855
 

00:25:44.885 --> 00:25:47.785
 

00:25:47.785 --> 00:25:50.765
 

00:25:50.765 --> 00:25:53.485
 

00:25:54.975 --> 00:25:56.445
 

00:25:57.375 --> 00:25:59.065
 

00:26:00.715 --> 00:26:03.645
 

00:26:03.645 --> 00:26:05.075
 

00:26:06.115 --> 00:26:09.105
 

00:26:09.105 --> 00:26:12.035
 

00:26:12.035 --> 00:26:15.115
 

00:26:15.115 --> 00:26:16.115
 

00:26:16.295 --> 00:26:17.295
 

00:26:18.355 --> 00:26:20.955
 

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:25.725
 

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:30.100
He is asking: "When this energy is not awakened in us

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:34.580
is it functioning at all or not at all?"

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:40.760
It is not functioning and we can see that we are not integrated people.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:47.300
Because if you, if you want to do something from your mind, your heart may say "no".

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:51.060
Your attention will say "no".

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.340
So there's no integration.

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:56.960
And secondly, not only that, that when this energy

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:01.180
is not awakened in a person, the religion which is innate,

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.280
within you,  is not awakened.

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:05.380
So you may follow any religion,

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:09.940
but you can do any sins, all of them are just the same.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.120
They are not righteous people,

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.260
they are not peaceful people.

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:19.060
They talk about it; but it's nothing inside, innate.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.660
The religion, the innate religion

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:26.520
Too much of heat.

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:30.500
Doesn't work.

00:27:32.915 --> 00:27:33.915
 

00:27:40.175 --> 00:27:43.525
Too much pressure of energy.
