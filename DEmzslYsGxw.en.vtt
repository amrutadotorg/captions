00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:59.282
Today is the first day, New Year's Day, according
to the Shalivahana Calendar, who were My forefathers.

00:02:59.282 --> 00:03:07.412
And in the whole of Maharashtra, it is regarded
as the New Year Day and the best day to start

00:03:07.412 --> 00:03:10.492
anything.

00:03:10.492 --> 00:03:17.232
So today I've decided to have Mahamaya Puja.

00:03:17.232 --> 00:03:30.142
I have never talked about Mahamaya, as it
is not to be talked or told - it's a secret,

00:03:30.142 --> 00:03:34.302
as they say.

00:03:34.302 --> 00:03:44.812
It's the basic of Sahaja Yoga, I should say,
because it's described, when the Goddess comes

00:03:44.812 --> 00:03:53.772
in the Sahasrara, the Shakti, She is Mahamaya
- "Sahasrare Mahamaya," already described.

00:03:53.772 --> 00:04:02.812
She has to be the Mahamaya, means She should
camouflage Herself fully.

00:04:02.812 --> 00:04:12.962
Nobody should be able to know Her as the Goddess,
to begin with; and even if they get Realization,

00:04:12.962 --> 00:04:20.311
they should not reach to the end of it.

00:04:20.311 --> 00:04:22.672
There are many reasons for that.

00:04:22.672 --> 00:04:25.114
The first thing: the job.

00:04:25.114 --> 00:04:28.902
The job of Mahamaya was to give Realization.

00:04:28.902 --> 00:04:37.112
Now, if I had come on a tiger with a sword
in My hand, nobody would have stood near Me.

00:04:37.112 --> 00:04:41.622
You all would have run away from Me.

00:04:41.622 --> 00:04:49.542
In any other form, if the Goddess had come,
She could not have done what She was supposed

00:04:49.542 --> 00:04:50.732
to do.

00:04:50.732 --> 00:04:59.611
Moreover, only if She had come as the Mother
of Christ, or Shri Sitaji, or you can say

00:04:59.611 --> 00:05:03.232
Fatima - they all ended their lives.

00:05:03.232 --> 00:05:10.291
They had to go away from this world so early,
I mean.

00:05:10.291 --> 00:05:13.282
They couldn't do any work whatsoever.

00:05:13.282 --> 00:05:21.092
Now this work, difficult work of giving Realization
to others, is very intricate.

00:05:21.092 --> 00:05:30.621
It has to work out in such a manner that nobody
feels that it is done by some great personality

00:05:30.621 --> 00:05:36.071
or with a great awe or fear.

00:05:36.071 --> 00:05:43.401
So the Mahamaya Incarnation has to come, that
people can come closer.

00:05:43.401 --> 00:05:56.601
Also, it has one advantage, very great advantages,
that when a simple person who's just a housewife

00:05:56.601 --> 00:06:01.961
starts giving Realization, people are flabbergasted.

00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:06.041
Also they think, "If She can do it, why not
we do it?

00:06:06.041 --> 00:06:09.221
After all, She's just an ordinary housewife.

00:06:09.221 --> 00:06:11.041
So, it's all right.

00:06:11.041 --> 00:06:13.751
If She can do something, we can also do it."

00:06:13.751 --> 00:06:23.501
So they have self-confidence, you see, and,
being a Mother, She does Her loving part,

00:06:23.501 --> 00:06:27.232
Her compassion, but the greatest is the patience.

00:06:27.232 --> 00:06:33.142
You see, none of them had so much patience,
all these Incarnations who came.

00:06:33.142 --> 00:06:40.401
You see how they disappeared from this Mother
Earth quickly, I'd say, by some excuse or

00:06:40.401 --> 00:06:41.401
other.

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:49.291
But I had to stay, I don't know how long,
but it has to be done up to a point, this

00:06:49.291 --> 00:06:51.331
work of giving Realization.

00:06:51.331 --> 00:07:04.422
The third thing was that you have to be identified
into My Body, into My cells of My Body, but

00:07:04.422 --> 00:07:13.582
this is a more difficult task because supposing
one of you becomes stupid, becomes foolish,

00:07:13.582 --> 00:07:15.112
quarrelsome.

00:07:15.112 --> 00:07:19.852
Anything you do, any small thing, it hurts
Me.

00:07:19.852 --> 00:07:22.952
It has to, but I don't think about Myself.

00:07:22.952 --> 00:07:25.302
I always think about you.

00:07:25.302 --> 00:07:29.841
So it's an indication to Me that something
has gone wrong somewhere.

00:07:29.841 --> 00:07:32.602
Somebody is doing something wrong to somebody.

00:07:32.602 --> 00:07:35.522
Some Sahaja Yogis are being tortured.

00:07:35.522 --> 00:07:37.371
Some are sick.

00:07:37.371 --> 00:07:42.691
Anything like that, I work it out very intensely
and intimately.

00:07:42.691 --> 00:07:48.732
Recently, today only, they told Me somebody
has got meningitis in Australia.

00:07:48.732 --> 00:07:51.292
Immediately, I gave bandhan.

00:07:51.292 --> 00:07:59.522
I'm sure such a person should be cured if
she has any faith in Me and she's in My being.

00:07:59.522 --> 00:08:04.232
Or somebody is ill somewhere, they tell Me
and such a person is saved.

00:08:04.232 --> 00:08:05.802
They call it a miracle.

00:08:05.802 --> 00:08:08.751
It is not a miracle.

00:08:08.751 --> 00:08:11.362
It's not a miracle.

00:08:11.362 --> 00:08:14.792
It's again the Mahamaya's blessings are like
this.

00:08:14.792 --> 00:08:17.142
You can't see how you are inside Me.

00:08:17.142 --> 00:08:19.072
You can't see your reflection within Me.

00:08:19.072 --> 00:08:20.072
You can't see.

00:08:20.072 --> 00:08:21.471
This is Mahamaya.

00:08:21.471 --> 00:08:27.322
This is the secret part of it, that you don't
know; and then when I feel the pain and if

00:08:27.322 --> 00:08:32.642
I try, look at it, because I have power to
cures, so you get cured.

00:08:32.642 --> 00:08:38.061
You don't know how it happens.

00:08:38.061 --> 00:08:59.031
Collectively, whatever you feel, I get it
in My Body.

00:08:59.031 --> 00:09:06.691
For example, collectively, if you have a left
Vishuddhi, I get it.

00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:12.732
If you have, say, right Vishuddhi, I get it.

00:09:12.732 --> 00:09:21.781
Any Chakra that you catch, collectively, I
get that problem and I have to solve it because

00:09:21.781 --> 00:09:24.422
it troubles Me, so I solve it.

00:09:24.422 --> 00:09:29.431
It's a compulsion that I have to solve it.

00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:33.142
Now in doing so, you see, you might think,
"Mother, we are troubling."

00:09:33.142 --> 00:09:34.281
You are not.

00:09:34.281 --> 00:09:35.931
It's My doing.

00:09:35.931 --> 00:09:39.021
I have taken you into Myself.

00:09:39.021 --> 00:09:41.482
You haven't.

00:09:41.482 --> 00:09:44.831
So you don't have to worry as to, as if you
are troubling Me.

00:09:44.831 --> 00:09:45.831
It's My own doing.

00:09:45.831 --> 00:09:47.052
It's My own work.

00:09:47.052 --> 00:09:48.052
It's My own responsibility.

00:09:48.052 --> 00:09:51.922
And if I have done it, it's done it because
I am supposed to do it.

00:09:51.922 --> 00:09:56.941
That's the job I have to do.

00:09:56.941 --> 00:10:00.132
So there's nothing to feel bad about it.

00:10:00.132 --> 00:10:03.691
But now, what is the purpose?

00:10:03.691 --> 00:10:13.742
As I told you, is that I could come close
to you and I need not, sort of, fill you with

00:10:13.742 --> 00:10:20.961
fear or awedness, or even a feeling that I
am not a human being.

00:10:20.961 --> 00:10:26.172
I behave exactly like human being, I react
exactly like human beings and all these powers

00:10:26.172 --> 00:10:28.362
are hidden within Myself.

00:10:28.362 --> 00:10:32.422
Unless and until you are a realized soul,
you won't understand.

00:10:32.422 --> 00:10:34.211
Whatever you may do, you won't understand.

00:10:34.211 --> 00:10:40.382
Or maybe in the previous life you had your
Realization, or maybe also you have done such

00:10:40.382 --> 00:10:43.642
tremendous punyas that you can recognize.

00:10:43.642 --> 00:10:48.382
There are people like that who have done it.

00:10:48.382 --> 00:11:00.042
But to make it more, sort of, congenial to
you is to become absolutely a human being.

00:11:00.042 --> 00:11:05.672
So I married, I have children, I have grandchildren
and I do shopping, as you see.

00:11:05.672 --> 00:11:08.352
People are surprised how I take Coca-Cola.

00:11:08.352 --> 00:11:11.232
I'm not supposed to take Coca-Cola!

00:11:11.232 --> 00:11:14.431
Or I eat popcorn.

00:11:14.431 --> 00:11:16.042
They're surprised.

00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:19.362
But I have to be just like you.

00:11:19.362 --> 00:11:22.022
But inside I am not.

00:11:22.022 --> 00:11:23.022
Outside I am.

00:11:23.022 --> 00:11:32.792
You see, My attention is such that it penetrates
into everything, and I remember each and every

00:11:32.792 --> 00:11:34.802
thing very well.

00:11:34.802 --> 00:11:37.372
My memory's very good, even at this age.

00:11:37.372 --> 00:11:44.581
So, you see, this attention itself is very
penetrating, and when it penetrates it carries

00:11:44.581 --> 00:11:49.862
with it all the powers that are required,
and acts.

00:11:49.862 --> 00:11:56.502
It's a tremendous machinery, I should say,
which is very subtle and works wonders.

00:11:56.502 --> 00:12:01.562
So you start telling Me that there is a miracle
that has happened, miracle that has happened.

00:12:01.562 --> 00:12:09.062
Nothing is a miracle because if you're all
in My Body and if My Body is divine, then

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:10.081
what is a miracle?

00:12:10.081 --> 00:12:14.941
It's all the communication, as this hand can
communicate with this hand, I communicate

00:12:14.941 --> 00:12:16.282
with you.

00:12:16.282 --> 00:12:25.352
But one thing is definite, that you should
not get lost with this rupa of Mahamaya.

00:12:25.352 --> 00:12:29.261
It's a very dangerous thing because once you
get lost, "Oh, Mother!

00:12:29.261 --> 00:12:35.452
After all" - you see, like that - then it
doesn't act, it doesn't work out.

00:12:35.452 --> 00:12:44.102
It's not a casual thing, but I want to live
very casually Myself to show that I'm casual,

00:12:44.102 --> 00:12:45.732
but I am not.

00:12:45.732 --> 00:12:52.382
While you should not pay your attention casually,
that won't work out because you are in My

00:12:52.382 --> 00:12:53.382
Body.

00:12:53.382 --> 00:13:02.922
Say, every cell in My Body is aware, and every
cell has a reflector.

00:13:02.922 --> 00:13:07.071
I don't know about, you know about it, but
there is a reflector in us, which works on

00:13:07.071 --> 00:13:09.391
remote control.

00:13:09.391 --> 00:13:12.752
So it works on remote control on your attention
also.

00:13:12.752 --> 00:13:14.662
If your attention is not all right, it corrects.

00:13:14.662 --> 00:13:20.331
It puts you - that's the best way we could
evolve human beings.

00:13:20.331 --> 00:13:28.452
There was no other way out, because the attention
of the people is, on the whole, in the whole

00:13:28.452 --> 00:13:31.652
world, is not yet on the Spirit.

00:13:31.652 --> 00:13:35.712
But suddenly, they get a glimpse that there
must be something beyond.

00:13:35.712 --> 00:13:38.691
So many religions have come, so many have
talked about it.

00:13:38.691 --> 00:13:46.592
So, they may say about it, they may talk about
it, but still the consciousness that we have

00:13:46.592 --> 00:13:52.071
to be the Spirit is among very few people
and they are the ones called as the seekers

00:13:52.071 --> 00:13:55.001
of truth, while the rest of the people are
not.

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:56.331
They are busy with this or that.

00:13:56.331 --> 00:13:57.331
"Oh, I'm very happy.

00:13:57.331 --> 00:13:58.553
I'm very happy with myself.

00:13:58.553 --> 00:14:00.511
You enjoy your holiday.

00:14:00.511 --> 00:14:03.131
I'll enjoy my holiday."

00:14:03.131 --> 00:14:05.561
Like that they talk.

00:14:05.561 --> 00:14:13.131
So under these circumstances, one had to come
in a camouflage, enter into like - you see,

00:14:13.131 --> 00:14:18.842
they are like enemies, I would say, enemies
of God's Love.

00:14:18.842 --> 00:14:25.172
So you have to enter into them like a spy,
camouflaging yourself, you see, and make them

00:14:25.172 --> 00:14:26.941
dance here, here and there.

00:14:26.941 --> 00:14:30.172
Let them get lost a little bit here and there.

00:14:30.172 --> 00:14:36.132
Let them see for themselves because with Mahamaya,
you see, She allows you.

00:14:36.132 --> 00:14:41.192
Now, there are some Sahaja Yogis who left
Sahaja Yoga, went off.

00:14:41.192 --> 00:14:45.602
I said, "All right, if they have gone, very
good.

00:14:45.602 --> 00:14:47.831
Good riddance of bad rubbish.

00:14:47.831 --> 00:14:48.831
Doesn't matter."

00:14:48.831 --> 00:14:50.372
And then they again come back.

00:14:50.372 --> 00:14:52.482
"Mother, this happened to us.

00:14:52.482 --> 00:14:54.022
That happened to us.

00:14:54.022 --> 00:14:55.102
Somebody got this.

00:14:55.102 --> 00:14:56.102
Somebody got that.

00:14:56.102 --> 00:15:00.372
We met with an accident, then somebody got
the sickness.

00:15:00.372 --> 00:15:03.172
Somebody is very unhappy.

00:15:03.172 --> 00:15:06.242
We broke our marriage."

00:15:06.242 --> 00:15:17.261
All kinds of things and when they say like
this, I mean, they do like this, I just smile.

00:15:17.261 --> 00:15:18.691
So it's a bad coin.

00:15:18.691 --> 00:15:20.072
All right, doesn't matter.

00:15:20.072 --> 00:15:26.272
Again they come back to Sahaja Yoga, but they
are left behind than others.

00:15:26.272 --> 00:15:31.372
They come up, but slowly, because they have
suffered, so they have come.

00:15:31.372 --> 00:15:37.492
In a way, there's a good example for others
that we don't want to suffer any more.

00:15:37.492 --> 00:15:43.972
The sufferings do not come from Mahamaya,
by any chance.

00:15:43.972 --> 00:15:58.272
On the contrary, once you have called Me the
Mother, you see, there is a protective attention

00:15:58.272 --> 00:15:59.842
on you.

00:15:59.842 --> 00:16:08.902
Then you misbehave, you cross all the limits
and things, then it acts on you.

00:16:08.902 --> 00:16:14.272
This action has taken place in many cases.

00:16:14.272 --> 00:16:20.522
Some of them have come back, some are still
hanging around and are doing wrong things,

00:16:20.522 --> 00:16:25.061
because they have done terribly wrong things
and they know they'll be found out.

00:16:25.061 --> 00:16:29.751
Now the worst thing that happens in Sahaja
Yoga that people try to make money out of

00:16:29.751 --> 00:16:36.691
Me because they know I don't understand money,
I don't understand banking and I'm very bad

00:16:36.691 --> 00:16:43.162
at it; but I'm not.

00:16:43.162 --> 00:16:44.162
I know everything.

00:16:44.162 --> 00:16:45.162
I know everything about everyone.

00:16:45.162 --> 00:16:46.352
They tell me lies.

00:16:46.352 --> 00:16:50.172
I know that they're telling Me lies, but is
allowed.

00:16:50.172 --> 00:16:53.311
Do what you like in Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:53.311 --> 00:16:56.992
You, yourself, will have to pay for it.

00:16:56.992 --> 00:17:03.501
It's something so great with this Mahamaya
rup, that, directly, I don't have to say anything.

00:17:03.501 --> 00:17:05.571
You don't even know that it's done.

00:17:05.571 --> 00:17:08.681
When it happens, they come rushing to Me,
"Mother, it has happened."

00:17:08.681 --> 00:17:16.371
Now, I have not done anything directly, neither
indirectly, but once you go out of the protection

00:17:16.371 --> 00:17:22.131
of your Mother, there are all negative forces
all around you, which also you don't see because

00:17:22.131 --> 00:17:23.652
you are partly blind.

00:17:23.652 --> 00:17:27.752
You couldn't see your Mother and you couldn't
see these negative forces also.

00:17:27.752 --> 00:17:33.751
Then you fall a prey to their talk, things,
whatever it is, or maybe into some paradoxical

00:17:33.751 --> 00:17:35.251
culture, as you have here.

00:17:35.251 --> 00:17:37.691
You may fall a prey to that.

00:17:37.691 --> 00:17:42.831
There's somebody I know in Sahaja Yoga who
has gone now and he's now drinking a lot and

00:17:42.831 --> 00:17:46.951
he's doing all kinds of things.

00:17:46.951 --> 00:17:52.871
So such a person gets lost because of his
doings.

00:17:52.871 --> 00:17:55.571
I am not doing anything to him.

00:17:55.571 --> 00:18:00.561
If you are with Me, if you are in Sahaja Yoga,
you are protected, you are looked after.

00:18:00.561 --> 00:18:06.032
But you have to stick on, you have to have
faith and even if there's any problem, it

00:18:06.032 --> 00:18:07.032
gets solved.

00:18:07.032 --> 00:18:14.022
But those who have gone out of it, who go
beyond My reach, then they suffer.

00:18:14.022 --> 00:18:20.071
So, even indirectly, I would say, I'm not
in any way harming them because I've decided

00:18:20.071 --> 00:18:22.371
not to harm anyone.

00:18:22.371 --> 00:18:23.732
That I have decided on.

00:18:23.732 --> 00:18:27.552
Especially those who call Me "Mother", I don't
want to harm them.

00:18:27.552 --> 00:18:28.552
But they get harmed.

00:18:28.552 --> 00:18:31.141
No doubt, they get harmed very badly.

00:18:31.141 --> 00:18:36.441
So, if it has happened, just take it up, "All
right, doesn't matter.

00:18:36.441 --> 00:18:37.511
Mother forgives everyone.

00:18:37.511 --> 00:18:38.612
It has happened, has happened.

00:18:38.612 --> 00:18:40.922
This is a lesson for me.

00:18:40.922 --> 00:18:45.751
It was something because of it happened and
now I'm back."

00:18:45.751 --> 00:18:52.352
And then you become sometimes a better Sahaja
Yogi than many of them.

00:18:52.352 --> 00:19:01.862
This kind of happening is very common in every
country.

00:19:01.862 --> 00:19:06.202
But you see, this whole culture, I feel, is
so paradoxical.

00:19:06.202 --> 00:19:13.402
Whole culture is so paradoxical, and what
is paid for is something that is ugly.

00:19:13.402 --> 00:19:18.032
What is paid for is something that is sinful.

00:19:18.032 --> 00:19:22.662
Whatever that is filthy, dirty is paid for
and accepted.

00:19:22.662 --> 00:19:29.072
It's very paradoxical because it goes against
growth of spirituality.

00:19:29.072 --> 00:19:33.292
One side, you are spiritual, you want to be
spiritual.

00:19:33.292 --> 00:19:39.241
Another side you have this paradoxical culture,
which takes you down to hell.

00:19:39.241 --> 00:19:43.402
It's like a story once Babamama told Me.

00:19:43.402 --> 00:19:46.882
Very interesting story it is.

00:19:46.882 --> 00:19:54.292
He said that some people did lots of punyas,
so they were taken to heaven, but they saw

00:19:54.292 --> 00:19:56.012
everybody was meditating, nicely enjoying.

00:19:56.012 --> 00:19:57.662
He said, "What is this?

00:19:57.662 --> 00:19:59.972
We did this also with Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:59.972 --> 00:20:02.052
What's the use of doing it here again?

00:20:02.052 --> 00:20:06.502
We should have something else, so let's have
a look at the hell."

00:20:06.502 --> 00:20:12.462
So they went down to see the hell and outside
they were having all these paradoxical culture

00:20:12.462 --> 00:20:16.432
of nude women and nude men dancing, shouting,
screaming.

00:20:16.432 --> 00:20:18.882
Dirty, filthy things going on there.

00:20:18.882 --> 00:20:23.982
So they said, "This seems to be different,
you know."

00:20:23.982 --> 00:20:28.302
So the people who were doing all these acts,
they asked, "Why are you here?"

00:20:28.302 --> 00:20:32.972
They said, "We've come here only for seeing
the hell."

00:20:32.972 --> 00:20:34.362
"Oh, all right.

00:20:34.362 --> 00:20:35.362
There are peepholes.

00:20:35.362 --> 00:20:36.362
You see through them."

00:20:36.362 --> 00:20:40.032
So they had big, big holes, out of which they
started seeing.

00:20:40.032 --> 00:20:48.622
So in one hole they saw people being put into
some sort of a filth, a pus and this and that.

00:20:48.622 --> 00:20:50.332
Another into feces, this, that.

00:20:50.332 --> 00:20:57.692
Another into a sort of a mire out of which
they could not come out, shouting.

00:20:57.692 --> 00:21:03.252
Then there's another one where they were boiled
in the boiling oil and some were beaten up.

00:21:03.252 --> 00:21:06.962
There were snakes and scorpions and this and
that.

00:21:06.962 --> 00:21:08.882
They said, "What is this all?"

00:21:08.882 --> 00:21:10.762
"That is hell you wanted to see.

00:21:10.762 --> 00:21:11.762
That is hell.

00:21:11.762 --> 00:21:12.922
You want to go, you can go there."

00:21:12.922 --> 00:21:17.372
So they said, "What are you doing here?"

00:21:17.372 --> 00:21:20.312
"This is publicity department.

00:21:20.312 --> 00:21:23.292
For hell."

00:21:23.292 --> 00:21:31.942
They ran back to heaven and asked forgiveness
that "We don't want, we don't want this hell,

00:21:31.942 --> 00:21:34.302
had enough of it."

00:21:34.302 --> 00:21:37.712
So, like that, you see, the whole world is
a camouflage.

00:21:37.712 --> 00:21:46.622
If you see, this is an anti-Mahamaya.

00:21:46.622 --> 00:21:51.532
So they say that this maya is created by God.

00:21:51.532 --> 00:21:52.902
No.

00:21:52.902 --> 00:21:59.812
Maya that God has created is this world, this
whole universe and all that.

00:21:59.812 --> 00:22:03.902
But this illusive life is created by human
beings.

00:22:03.902 --> 00:22:10.482
Absolutely, through their projections of their
brains and mental capacities, they have projected

00:22:10.482 --> 00:22:13.192
because money is everything.

00:22:13.192 --> 00:22:17.842
If money is everything, by hook or crook,
if you have to get the money, then do what

00:22:17.842 --> 00:22:18.842
you like.

00:22:18.842 --> 00:22:23.932
And every day you read in the newspaper, I
mean horrible stories about how people want

00:22:23.932 --> 00:22:28.862
to make money, how they want to sell their
daughters, how they want to sell their wives.

00:22:28.862 --> 00:22:32.242
Anything is all right as long as you have
money.

00:22:32.242 --> 00:22:34.972
If you can make money, nothing matters.

00:22:34.972 --> 00:22:45.742
So this is one of the illusions that human
beings have created is what you call is "money

00:22:45.742 --> 00:22:51.962
maya" and, in that, comes also the wealth,
possessions, materialism.

00:22:51.962 --> 00:23:00.852
Everything is created by human beings, and
this creation of materialism then boils you

00:23:00.852 --> 00:23:10.322
down to a personality which is involved in
all sinful act.

00:23:10.322 --> 00:23:14.952
Everything is all right because if money is
all right, materialism is all right.

00:23:14.952 --> 00:23:24.272
For example, the way people went down to America
- Spanish - and killed so many aboriginals

00:23:24.272 --> 00:23:25.272
there.

00:23:25.272 --> 00:23:31.482
Then also English went and all kinds of people
went there in America.

00:23:31.482 --> 00:23:38.692
The way they have tortured is something, is
you cannot think how human beings can behave

00:23:38.692 --> 00:23:48.562
like this towards ordinary people, who are
just simple people living in the jungles.

00:23:48.562 --> 00:23:56.632
How can you do such a thing to them, such
horrible, you can call it a genocide?

00:23:56.632 --> 00:24:00.502
It's really a terrible thing, they did it.

00:24:00.502 --> 00:24:07.092
We know more about these Germans, the way
they behaved recently, but even in those days

00:24:07.092 --> 00:24:09.662
they used to do all kinds of things.

00:24:09.662 --> 00:24:15.052
And the nature, which is a Maya of God, which
how it takes respite.

00:24:15.052 --> 00:24:22.932
There were people in America, Central America,
near River Mississippi in Missouri.

00:24:22.932 --> 00:24:25.842
They're called as rednecks long time.

00:24:25.842 --> 00:24:28.462
He must be remembering this.

00:24:28.462 --> 00:24:34.212
And because they were called rednecks by the
blacks, they used to kill so many blacks,

00:24:34.212 --> 00:24:40.412
they used to hang their children on the tree,
they used to throw their bodies in the river,

00:24:40.412 --> 00:24:48.192
sometimes get them drowned; did all kinds
of things to the black people, under the name

00:24:48.192 --> 00:24:53.922
that they were white people and they're superior
and something like that, behaving worse than

00:24:53.922 --> 00:24:55.452
animals.

00:24:55.452 --> 00:25:04.722
Now you know, there, floods came in, terrible
floods came in and those floods drowned these

00:25:04.722 --> 00:25:10.592
rednecks beyond their necks and so many were
dead.

00:25:10.592 --> 00:25:13.182
One would say that "How could it happen?"

00:25:13.182 --> 00:25:14.182
It is.

00:25:14.182 --> 00:25:21.122
Another example I'll give you is the, you
see, the way Americans were treating all these

00:25:21.122 --> 00:25:29.392
Bolivians and the Colombians, that they would
buy everything from them very cheaply, and

00:25:29.392 --> 00:25:32.442
like wheat and everything, very cheap.

00:25:32.442 --> 00:25:38.832
Just the minimum profits they had, and they
would sell it at a double price and make money.

00:25:38.832 --> 00:25:47.642
All this was really criminal to do from any
point of view, but they were doing it.

00:25:47.642 --> 00:25:56.042
I went to - I don't know what year it was,
1978 or so - into Colombia and there was one

00:25:56.042 --> 00:25:57.212
man came in the party.

00:25:57.212 --> 00:25:58.212
I was with My husband.

00:25:58.212 --> 00:26:02.252
He said, "I've heard You are a great, saintly
person from India.

00:26:02.252 --> 00:26:08.262
Can You give us some blessings that we really
hit these Americans nicely and see them off?

00:26:08.262 --> 00:26:15.862
Because the way they are exposing us to our
poverty and things, they're horrible."

00:26:15.862 --> 00:26:19.512
I said, "Why do you want to hit them?"

00:26:19.512 --> 00:26:21.442
"No, they require it, otherwise they'll not
be all right."

00:26:21.442 --> 00:26:22.612
I was just in the party.

00:26:22.612 --> 00:26:24.252
I didn't want to discuss it.

00:26:24.252 --> 00:26:25.252
"All right."

00:26:25.252 --> 00:26:30.792
And, you know, this cocaine came up there.

00:26:30.792 --> 00:26:35.852
And if you go and see now that place - I've
been to, Bogota, with My husband - it was

00:26:35.852 --> 00:26:41.922
like a shanty town, absolutely like a shanty
town, made of tin and this and that.

00:26:41.922 --> 00:26:46.702
Now, big, big buildings are there, and you
have escalators and everything.

00:26:46.702 --> 00:26:51.522
They used to bring petroleum with the donkey's
cart.

00:26:51.522 --> 00:26:53.702
Can you imagine?

00:26:53.702 --> 00:27:00.172
In such a short time it has become such a
big country and not only that, but now the

00:27:00.172 --> 00:27:05.492
whole America is afraid of them, even Australia.

00:27:05.492 --> 00:27:09.942
The drugs are taken by Americans themselves.

00:27:09.942 --> 00:27:18.052
In Washington there is such a lot of storage
of drugs that they don't know what to do,

00:27:18.052 --> 00:27:20.682
and even the senators are taking to drugs.

00:27:20.682 --> 00:27:21.682
Can you imagine?

00:27:21.682 --> 00:27:26.712
I wouldn't be surprised one day Mr. Clinton
lands up with some drugs.

00:27:26.712 --> 00:27:31.572
The way it is such a fashion, it is such a
fantastic thing for them.

00:27:31.572 --> 00:27:36.932
You go to any party of elite people, which
I have to some time, they only talk about

00:27:36.932 --> 00:27:37.932
drugs, you see.

00:27:37.932 --> 00:27:38.932
"You want?

00:27:38.932 --> 00:27:40.612
Which drug do you like?"

00:27:40.612 --> 00:27:42.372
I said, "I don't like any drug."

00:27:42.372 --> 00:27:43.372
"No.

00:27:43.372 --> 00:27:46.422
If you want, you can get it cheaply in this,
you know, if you go there and get it there."

00:27:46.422 --> 00:27:48.382
They discuss it in the elite parties.

00:27:48.382 --> 00:27:53.282
Also about gurus, you see, which guru you
want.

00:27:53.282 --> 00:27:56.112
"There is a sale on of a such-and-such guru.

00:27:56.112 --> 00:27:58.132
On a bargain you can go."

00:27:58.132 --> 00:27:59.132
Like that.

00:27:59.132 --> 00:28:01.312
You know, it's all so stupid, I tell you.

00:28:01.312 --> 00:28:05.202
I said, "These people are so immature, worse
than children."

00:28:05.202 --> 00:28:08.662
They are not grown up, only in age.

00:28:08.662 --> 00:28:16.082
They have done good maybe in mechanism and
all those things, but that has nothing to

00:28:16.082 --> 00:28:24.482
do with your personality growth, and that's
why I find them just like dwarves the way

00:28:24.482 --> 00:28:27.022
they have attitude towards things.

00:28:27.022 --> 00:28:35.442
And everyone practically must have taken drugs,
everybody except for Asians may not have,

00:28:35.442 --> 00:28:41.342
because now I have learnt that there are two
genes which protect the Asians, but the white

00:28:41.342 --> 00:28:43.632
skin has not those genes which are to protect.

00:28:43.632 --> 00:28:49.462
The other day in the lecture I told them that
there are two genes which are protective,

00:28:49.462 --> 00:28:52.812
found only among Asians, means Chinese and
Indians.

00:28:52.812 --> 00:28:57.432
All the rest of the people don't have those
genes, which should protect them.

00:28:57.432 --> 00:29:03.832
So they are so vulnerable to all these nonsensical
things that are going on, and they take to

00:29:03.832 --> 00:29:04.832
it so easily.

00:29:04.832 --> 00:29:10.352
I used to wonder how these educated, good
people, I mean people of My husband's ranking

00:29:10.352 --> 00:29:12.732
also were stupid like that.

00:29:12.732 --> 00:29:14.862
Every time they would bring a new wife.

00:29:14.862 --> 00:29:20.902
One day they brought, one of them, brought
a wife who was hardly about twenty years of

00:29:20.902 --> 00:29:21.902
age.

00:29:21.902 --> 00:29:23.492
This fellow is at least seventy.

00:29:23.492 --> 00:29:24.492
I didn't know.

00:29:24.492 --> 00:29:25.492
My husband pinched Me.

00:29:25.492 --> 00:29:27.592
He said, "That's his wife.

00:29:27.592 --> 00:29:28.592
All right?

00:29:28.592 --> 00:29:30.572
Don't call her a grand-daughter."

00:29:30.572 --> 00:29:36.042
I used to drop bricks after bricks there.

00:29:36.042 --> 00:29:41.532
Such absurd people coming, and a seventy-year-old
man coming with a lady who's twenty years.

00:29:41.532 --> 00:29:45.942
I mean, you can never think that she could
be his wife.

00:29:45.942 --> 00:29:50.312
At the most a sister-in-law, at the most,
but I thought she was the grand-daughter so

00:29:50.312 --> 00:29:52.042
he pinched Me and told Me that "Don't."

00:29:52.042 --> 00:29:54.422
This is it, you see.

00:29:54.422 --> 00:30:00.162
It's such a paradoxical world that if you
come from Sahaj to this, you see "What's going

00:30:00.162 --> 00:30:01.162
on?

00:30:01.162 --> 00:30:02.162
What are they doing?

00:30:02.162 --> 00:30:04.052
What's the matter with them?"

00:30:04.052 --> 00:30:09.542
Now, taking out clothes, is it something great
to take out clothes, you see?

00:30:09.542 --> 00:30:16.452
In Switzerland, which is such a cold country,
I was wearing My sweater, My coat, covering

00:30:16.452 --> 00:30:22.982
My head, wearing warm socks, everything because
they said, "Let's go out for, just for a drive."

00:30:22.982 --> 00:30:25.962
So, we got down.

00:30:25.962 --> 00:30:29.692
There's one lake called Lausanne.

00:30:29.692 --> 00:30:31.092
Lausanne, there's a very big lake.

00:30:31.092 --> 00:30:33.902
So, as usual, Gregoire ran up to see how is
the situation there.

00:30:33.902 --> 00:30:35.352
He came back with a double speed.

00:30:35.352 --> 00:30:37.452
He said, "No, no, Mother, You can't go there."

00:30:37.452 --> 00:30:38.452
I said, "Why?"

00:30:38.452 --> 00:30:39.452
"No.

00:30:39.452 --> 00:30:40.452
You can't.

00:30:40.452 --> 00:30:41.452
I am sorry.

00:30:41.452 --> 00:30:42.452
You can't.

00:30:42.452 --> 00:30:43.452
Let's go."

00:30:43.452 --> 00:30:44.782
They were all topless women sitting there.

00:30:44.782 --> 00:30:51.462
You know, this - in Australia they had, and
even New Zealand, they had cricket match.

00:30:51.462 --> 00:30:55.622
They're supposed to be very good cricketers.

00:30:55.622 --> 00:30:58.492
And when we opened the TV, the women were
sitting topless.

00:30:58.492 --> 00:30:59.912
We closed it.

00:30:59.912 --> 00:31:04.442
We couldn't see that, but I was told now they're
losing in cricket.

00:31:04.442 --> 00:31:11.282
They will, definitely, compared to Indian
spinners, who are young innocent boys, you

00:31:11.282 --> 00:31:13.342
see - very young, twenty, twenty-one.

00:31:13.342 --> 00:31:18.102
They have to be because there's no innocence,
there's no chastity, there's no respect.

00:31:18.102 --> 00:31:19.962
The women are sitting topless.

00:31:19.962 --> 00:31:21.192
How can they win?

00:31:21.192 --> 00:31:23.592
They're insulting the Goddess there only.

00:31:23.592 --> 00:31:24.692
How can they win?

00:31:24.692 --> 00:31:29.852
They cannot win, and a game like cricket is
something sensible.

00:31:29.852 --> 00:31:36.382
Even, I don't know, in any game if they can
win, because if this - distract the attention

00:31:36.382 --> 00:31:37.382
completely.

00:31:37.382 --> 00:31:39.962
But why do they go like that?

00:31:39.962 --> 00:31:43.552
Are all women trying to become prostitutes?

00:31:43.552 --> 00:31:45.412
What is the sense in it?

00:31:45.412 --> 00:31:47.832
I can't understand.

00:31:47.832 --> 00:31:49.932
And this is something they don't understand.

00:31:49.932 --> 00:31:55.582
If you tell them that, "You see, I was told
that Mrs. Thatcher openly said that in this

00:31:55.582 --> 00:31:59.972
culture women must expose their body."

00:31:59.972 --> 00:32:02.052
There's such a paradox.

00:32:02.052 --> 00:32:03.422
Can't understand.

00:32:03.422 --> 00:32:09.692
They show here Mother Mary as the sublime
personality, and they show here women as the

00:32:09.692 --> 00:32:12.672
- women who are nude.

00:32:12.672 --> 00:32:17.652
They want to become Mother Mary or what do
they want to become?

00:32:17.652 --> 00:32:22.932
And people like this, horrible people like
this Michael Jackson - he is that - are so

00:32:22.932 --> 00:32:24.762
prominent making money.

00:32:24.762 --> 00:32:26.492
I mean, just see the paradox.

00:32:26.492 --> 00:32:37.192
Can you say that this is an advanced country
when the ideas are so, so low?

00:32:37.192 --> 00:32:41.172
How can it be?

00:32:41.172 --> 00:32:48.872
After coming to Sahaja Yoga, you can see for
yourself, but it makes your, these protective

00:32:48.872 --> 00:32:50.392
genes established in you.

00:32:50.392 --> 00:32:53.122
This is the thing in Sahaj Yoga.

00:32:53.122 --> 00:32:55.552
And suddenly, you people have given up all
that nonsense.

00:32:55.552 --> 00:32:57.802
You don't want all that now.

00:32:57.802 --> 00:33:05.452
Actually, if you see it properly from any
logical point of view, you see, without the

00:33:05.452 --> 00:33:10.945
Maya of this nonsense - if you see it, you
can logically understand that it is wrong.

00:33:10.945 --> 00:33:17.012
You see, why do you feel jealous of another
man or woman?

00:33:17.012 --> 00:33:18.351
You feel jealous.

00:33:18.351 --> 00:33:21.922
That means you want just life, isn't it?

00:33:21.922 --> 00:33:28.222
People have murdered, women have murdered
men or women because they were jealous.

00:33:28.222 --> 00:33:36.382
If it was natural and normal and joy giving,
you should not have felt bad about it.

00:33:36.382 --> 00:33:41.462
All these things should logically be understood
that, why we don't like this happening.

00:33:41.462 --> 00:33:44.332
Or this happens to your own daughter, you
may not like.

00:33:44.332 --> 00:33:48.952
Nowadays there are people who like it, also,
to the daughters.

00:33:48.952 --> 00:33:55.052
But - now going to that limit of things, like
there's one person, say, he has something

00:33:55.052 --> 00:33:59.802
to do with the daughter and the whole society's
against it, today.

00:33:59.802 --> 00:34:07.622
But maybe tomorrow, with this Maya, this horrible
devil-maya, which is anti-maya, will work

00:34:07.622 --> 00:34:11.572
out and maybe that nobody will mind it.

00:34:11.572 --> 00:34:13.192
It may be.

00:34:13.192 --> 00:34:21.692
If you people do not hold it right into your
hands, the culture side of Sahaj, I don't

00:34:21.692 --> 00:34:22.942
know what's going to happen.

00:34:22.942 --> 00:34:27.422
If you read newspaper every day, you feel
really dizzy, you don't understand in what

00:34:27.422 --> 00:34:29.471
Maya these people are lost.

00:34:29.471 --> 00:34:31.632
So it's an anti-maya.

00:34:31.632 --> 00:34:35.372
Because Mahamaya has come, so anti-maya has
come.

00:34:35.372 --> 00:34:40.572
Fifty years back or sixty years back, it was
not that bad, I can tell you.

00:34:40.572 --> 00:34:46.052
Once in a while people used to do something
nonsensical, but now it is rampant.

00:34:46.052 --> 00:34:48.612
But it now has become a fashion.

00:34:48.612 --> 00:34:54.592
It's worse than that, is that accepted as
a fashion, and if you're not in it, you're

00:34:54.592 --> 00:34:55.592
out.

00:34:55.592 --> 00:34:59.722
You have to be in the madhouse.

00:34:59.722 --> 00:35:05.012
You should see this clearly because now you
have come into the Maya of God.

00:35:05.012 --> 00:35:12.362
"Maya" also means love, the God's love, and,
in that, your eyes should open out and see:

00:35:12.362 --> 00:35:15.032
what horrible things this they are doing?

00:35:15.032 --> 00:35:16.032
What is this disco?

00:35:16.032 --> 00:35:21.822
You know, in India they brought the disco
and, of course, some boys who were Muslims

00:35:21.822 --> 00:35:29.622
actually were rich and they carried young
girls, because in disco the law was that you

00:35:29.622 --> 00:35:35.902
must bring your partner - young girls who
were adults, maybe not be adults also, and

00:35:35.902 --> 00:35:41.782
started giving them alcohol, drinking and
they got lost.

00:35:41.782 --> 00:35:43.142
The parents wouldn't accept them.

00:35:43.142 --> 00:35:48.832
They had to go to brothels or they were sold
out or I don't know what happened to them.

00:35:48.832 --> 00:35:51.112
But that is the reaction in that country.

00:35:51.112 --> 00:35:53.422
It may be one day they'll be accepted.

00:35:53.422 --> 00:35:59.372
One day we'll have the same thing because
it has such a overpowering effect, and that's

00:35:59.372 --> 00:36:02.142
why the Maya of God is such.

00:36:02.142 --> 00:36:09.462
This, all these beautiful things are there
so you can get lost with it, you can see it,

00:36:09.462 --> 00:36:11.952
you can picture it, you can paint it.

00:36:11.952 --> 00:36:14.292
But no, they are not - they're not interested.

00:36:14.292 --> 00:36:16.012
They'll make this also ugly.

00:36:16.012 --> 00:36:17.612
They'll make every picture ugly.

00:36:17.612 --> 00:36:20.072
They'll make every face ugly.

00:36:20.072 --> 00:36:26.282
So this is the anti-maya that is there and,
for that, you need a Mahamaya to correct it

00:36:26.282 --> 00:36:29.202
and to solve the problem.

00:36:29.202 --> 00:36:34.822
The complete working of the Divine depends
on you people, wherever you are.

00:36:34.822 --> 00:36:43.802
How many you are is not the point - wherever
you are, how intense you are, how you want

00:36:43.802 --> 00:36:50.922
to work it out, how you want to put your attention
to.

00:36:50.922 --> 00:36:58.461
It's very important how you are going to do,
it because you people should understand the

00:36:58.461 --> 00:36:59.461
responsibility.

00:36:59.461 --> 00:37:06.401
This world is getting drowned, and I feel
that at least eighty percent people will be

00:37:06.401 --> 00:37:07.881
finished.

00:37:07.881 --> 00:37:14.492
Ten would be hanging in between in limbo I
think, really, and ten percent will be Sahaja

00:37:14.492 --> 00:37:16.811
Yogis, the way it is moving in the West.

00:37:16.811 --> 00:37:18.731
Maybe in India may not be.

00:37:18.731 --> 00:37:19.731
I can't say.

00:37:19.731 --> 00:37:22.092
India is very fast-moving Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:22.092 --> 00:37:27.201
Also Russia and all these Eastern Bloc people
are just jumping into it.

00:37:27.201 --> 00:37:30.321
I don't know how they have discovered Me so
easily.

00:37:30.321 --> 00:37:31.542
They say My Face is evident.

00:37:31.542 --> 00:37:39.431
I don't know what makes them think.

00:37:39.431 --> 00:37:42.702
The another Maya is of power.

00:37:42.702 --> 00:37:49.692
And the power of money if they can avoid,
then they try to have power over territory,

00:37:49.692 --> 00:37:52.452
of the land, this, that.

00:37:52.452 --> 00:37:57.772
That also made them mad quite a lot in the
past, but now they're all fighting for some

00:37:57.772 --> 00:38:00.802
nonsensical land, which will never belong
to them.

00:38:00.802 --> 00:38:05.282
It stays here permanently, eternally, but
the fights are going on.

00:38:05.282 --> 00:38:11.341
Then, in the name of religion, they're fighting
for this area, that area or they're fighting

00:38:11.341 --> 00:38:19.341
for, say, just for changing their religion
or getting more people in that religion.

00:38:19.341 --> 00:38:23.052
I don't know what is their idea of religion
is.

00:38:23.052 --> 00:38:24.962
Is religion meant for that?

00:38:24.962 --> 00:38:26.372
Just think of it.

00:38:26.372 --> 00:38:27.952
Nobody thinks like that.

00:38:27.952 --> 00:38:30.472
What is it meant for?

00:38:30.472 --> 00:38:36.592
So here, again, the Mahamaya has to work and
the Mahamaya works this way, that She integrates

00:38:36.592 --> 00:38:38.121
all the religions.

00:38:38.121 --> 00:38:43.671
She shows that all religions are the same,
have the same spirituality.

00:38:43.671 --> 00:38:48.851
It's on the same tree of spirituality, they
have grown.

00:38:48.851 --> 00:38:53.022
Instead of making people spiritual, they have
made them money-oriented or they have made

00:38:53.022 --> 00:38:56.042
them power-oriented.

00:38:56.042 --> 00:38:58.022
I mean it's the other way round.

00:38:58.022 --> 00:39:06.161
It's like the tree growing underneath or something,
something absurd that you cannot explain and

00:39:06.161 --> 00:39:09.052
that is the thing is that illusive.

00:39:09.052 --> 00:39:10.732
That illusiveness is called Maya.

00:39:10.732 --> 00:39:17.192
And this illusiveness appeals to many people.

00:39:17.192 --> 00:39:19.911
Appeals - that's the point I'm worried about.

00:39:19.911 --> 00:39:27.061
Something is illusive, then they go on running
after that like a mirage and ultimately they

00:39:27.061 --> 00:39:28.061
are destroyed.

00:39:28.061 --> 00:39:35.712
So what you see, a picture just now, is that
at least so many - ten percent people - will

00:39:35.712 --> 00:39:37.782
be saved, at the most.

00:39:37.782 --> 00:39:43.851
But this is a very sad affair because it has
taken so much effort to make human beings,

00:39:43.851 --> 00:39:49.571
to make them all right, to make them sensible
and now what you find is that they are going

00:39:49.571 --> 00:39:50.811
to be all finished.

00:39:50.811 --> 00:39:57.032
It's too much to bear, too much to believe
in, but it is going to happen, if you people

00:39:57.032 --> 00:39:59.962
do not take it up seriously and work it out.

00:39:59.962 --> 00:40:05.762
For you, also, there should not be any illusions
because many of you are more busy with other

00:40:05.762 --> 00:40:06.762
things.

00:40:06.762 --> 00:40:09.611
To you other things are more important than
Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:09.611 --> 00:40:13.042
But whatever you are doing, you can bring
in Sahaja Yoga into that.

00:40:13.042 --> 00:40:15.782
Into anything you can bring in Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:15.782 --> 00:40:21.452
I said in politics, in agriculture, in social
life, in your jobs, everywhere you can bring

00:40:21.452 --> 00:40:22.452
Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:22.452 --> 00:40:30.331
By your own behavior, by your own intelligence,
you can bring in Sahaja Yoga into every field,

00:40:30.331 --> 00:40:33.611
which you have to think about, "Where can
we take Sahaj Yoga?

00:40:33.611 --> 00:40:34.962
Where can we work it out?"

00:40:34.962 --> 00:40:43.952
And this is what is to get into the Maya of
God, that you get rid of all the illusions

00:40:43.952 --> 00:40:49.322
which are false, which do not allow you to
see the right thing, and then seriously to

00:40:49.322 --> 00:40:52.632
get into the productive side of Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:52.632 --> 00:40:59.022
Can you imagine how productive is Sahaja Yoga,
how the miracles work out, how there is this

00:40:59.022 --> 00:41:03.842
Divine Power is anxious to help, despite all
this Mahamaya and all that.

00:41:03.842 --> 00:41:11.252
I'll give you the example of My grandson now
because this time we had a big Maya on him.

00:41:11.252 --> 00:41:15.592
He was - I told him that, "You should not
go to Cambridge, you know."

00:41:15.592 --> 00:41:19.762
I said, "They don't give admissions normally
and, moreover, it's more sort of theoretical

00:41:19.762 --> 00:41:22.052
things, not actually good for you.

00:41:22.052 --> 00:41:24.942
You'll be bored stupid there, so don't go."

00:41:24.942 --> 00:41:26.312
He wouldn't listen to Me.

00:41:26.312 --> 00:41:30.702
Then he agreed, "All right, if I get admission
in these, these big universities in America

00:41:30.702 --> 00:41:31.702
I'll go."

00:41:31.702 --> 00:41:32.802
But he didn't try.

00:41:32.802 --> 00:41:33.802
Nothing of the kind.

00:41:33.802 --> 00:41:39.782
Last minute we sent him a application and
he sent that application.

00:41:39.782 --> 00:41:40.982
Last minute.

00:41:40.982 --> 00:41:43.342
They said, "You cannot come.

00:41:43.342 --> 00:41:44.342
This is that.

00:41:44.342 --> 00:41:50.552
You have to prepare for this exam, SAT exam,
that exam", and then he got a fright.

00:41:50.552 --> 00:41:51.552
You see, which he learnt.

00:41:51.552 --> 00:41:53.831
"My God, I thought so easy to go to America.

00:41:53.831 --> 00:41:55.482
It is not."

00:41:55.482 --> 00:41:57.972
Even if you certify money it is not easy.

00:41:57.972 --> 00:42:03.182
Then he started thinking that "What was I
thinking about Cambridge, Cambridge so much?

00:42:03.182 --> 00:42:06.732
This is the same, equally the same difficult
thing.

00:42:06.732 --> 00:42:13.212
" Until then he wanted to go for SAT, there
to sit for an exam, but actually the appearing

00:42:13.212 --> 00:42:18.532
of the examination was only after six days
and I thought, "How can he go?

00:42:18.532 --> 00:42:20.762
Six days he cannot prepare even."

00:42:20.762 --> 00:42:22.982
So they said, "You cannot come for SAT here."

00:42:22.982 --> 00:42:24.871
Now he was settled down in India.

00:42:24.871 --> 00:42:26.312
He didn't know what to do.

00:42:26.312 --> 00:42:30.512
Still he was saying, "I'll try for this Cambridge
again and this."

00:42:30.512 --> 00:42:32.202
I said, "Now, forget it."

00:42:32.202 --> 00:42:34.432
He wouldn't listen to Me.

00:42:34.432 --> 00:42:35.911
Then he was very disappointed.

00:42:35.911 --> 00:42:42.392
He telephoned to Me to say that "I think that
if I have to go to America, I'll go in a good

00:42:42.392 --> 00:42:43.392
university.

00:42:43.392 --> 00:42:48.571
Otherwise, no use going to a cheap university;
I can get better education in India."

00:42:48.571 --> 00:42:49.571
So I said, "All right."

00:42:49.571 --> 00:42:53.512
Then I gave a bandhan because he wanted to
go abroad and learn something.

00:42:53.512 --> 00:42:54.512
It's all right.

00:42:54.512 --> 00:42:58.532
Can you imagine, it has worked like a real
miracle.

00:42:58.532 --> 00:43:03.722
The university wrote to him that he is admitted
unconditionally.

00:43:03.722 --> 00:43:04.762
Nobody did anything.

00:43:04.762 --> 00:43:07.292
Nobody wrote anything.

00:43:07.292 --> 00:43:08.562
Nothing.

00:43:08.562 --> 00:43:09.562
They have said it.

00:43:09.562 --> 00:43:14.671
None of them can understand what has happened,
how did they get unconditional admission?

00:43:14.671 --> 00:43:20.492
So, you see, it's a miracle, but before that
this Maya was to be played, otherwise he would

00:43:20.492 --> 00:43:23.621
never have seen the importance of it.

00:43:23.621 --> 00:43:26.101
So, in your lives also, such a Maya plays.

00:43:26.101 --> 00:43:28.282
When you do not want to do the right thing.

00:43:28.282 --> 00:43:29.821
All right, do it.

00:43:29.821 --> 00:43:30.982
You do this.

00:43:30.982 --> 00:43:32.522
All right, do that.

00:43:32.522 --> 00:43:33.522
Do that.

00:43:33.522 --> 00:43:35.232
Ultimately, you learn a lesson.

00:43:35.232 --> 00:43:37.561
I don't say no, if you say, "Mother, I want
to do it."

00:43:37.561 --> 00:43:38.561
"All right, go ahead."

00:43:38.561 --> 00:43:39.561
"I want to do that."

00:43:39.561 --> 00:43:42.062
"Oh, go ahead, whatever you want to do."

00:43:42.062 --> 00:43:46.972
If I find you congenial, I may tell you that
"Better not do, it's not going to help you."

00:43:46.972 --> 00:43:54.752
But then they,when they get a complete disillusionment,
then they take to the right decision, come

00:43:54.752 --> 00:44:01.022
to the right thing because, see, let them
try with their own freedom, but then they

00:44:01.022 --> 00:44:02.811
realize that, "What Mother said was right.

00:44:02.811 --> 00:44:04.401
I should have done that.

00:44:04.401 --> 00:44:05.502
All right."

00:44:05.502 --> 00:44:06.722
So this is it.

00:44:06.722 --> 00:44:11.743
The Maya is like this, that it allows you
to do what you like.

00:44:11.743 --> 00:44:13.292
You use your freedom.

00:44:13.292 --> 00:44:14.532
You go places to places.

00:44:14.532 --> 00:44:16.762
Do what you want to do.

00:44:16.762 --> 00:44:18.462
Whatever you think it proper, you do it.

00:44:18.462 --> 00:44:25.222
All right, this is a part of the Maya, but
Mahamaya is that which brings you back, brings

00:44:25.222 --> 00:44:32.272
you back to normal, brings you back to reality,
to understand.

00:44:32.272 --> 00:44:35.952
It is at that point when you understand Mahamaya.

00:44:35.952 --> 00:44:38.601
Like I would say Russians did.

00:44:38.601 --> 00:44:44.042
How they understood that I'm doing greater
work than Einstein?

00:44:44.042 --> 00:44:46.881
"See, what is Einstein?

00:44:46.881 --> 00:44:49.542
He is just working with the matter.

00:44:49.542 --> 00:44:52.901
You are working with human beings, do You
realize, Mother."

00:44:52.901 --> 00:44:58.332
To them I am higher than all of them, greater
than all of them, which is a fact also, I

00:44:58.332 --> 00:44:59.332
must say.

00:44:59.332 --> 00:45:06.142
It's fact in a way that the way work is done,
but doesn't mean that it's something to be

00:45:06.142 --> 00:45:09.581
ego about it, because if I am made like that,
I am doing it.

00:45:09.581 --> 00:45:10.581
What is so special?

00:45:10.581 --> 00:45:14.182
I've been like this, so I'm like that.

00:45:14.182 --> 00:45:15.762
What is so special?

00:45:15.762 --> 00:45:20.242
One gets the pride and the ego only when you
think you are doing something more beyond

00:45:20.242 --> 00:45:21.242
you.

00:45:21.242 --> 00:45:22.242
You see, it's all there.

00:45:22.242 --> 00:45:23.242
I've already got it.

00:45:23.242 --> 00:45:25.391
Now, see this tent is meant to give shade.

00:45:25.391 --> 00:45:30.851
Now if it is giving shade, should it have
ego?

00:45:30.851 --> 00:45:32.661
Sun is meant to give you light.

00:45:32.661 --> 00:45:37.891
If it is giving light, it's giving light because
God has given him the light to be given, so

00:45:37.891 --> 00:45:39.311
he's giving light to you.

00:45:39.311 --> 00:45:40.801
Should he have ego?

00:45:40.801 --> 00:45:48.542
But you'll be, you see, assume that you have
got something special about you, then you

00:45:48.542 --> 00:45:50.421
have to do that, whatever special you have.

00:45:50.421 --> 00:45:54.242
Now, the flowers are so beautiful, they're
so special, so charming.

00:45:54.242 --> 00:45:57.592
I mean, I couldn't take out My attention from
them, they're so beautiful.

00:45:57.592 --> 00:46:00.702
All right, but if they are so, they are so.

00:46:00.702 --> 00:46:01.812
What is there?

00:46:01.812 --> 00:46:07.042
They're not going to have ego about it, that
"We are so good, we are so beautiful."

00:46:07.042 --> 00:46:10.262
No, none of that.

00:46:10.262 --> 00:46:17.601
So this ego comes when there is again the
Mahamaya part of it, that you are in the Maya

00:46:17.601 --> 00:46:21.341
of your own understanding.

00:46:21.341 --> 00:46:23.831
Now you're Sahaja Yogis.

00:46:23.831 --> 00:46:24.962
You should be very proud.

00:46:24.962 --> 00:46:28.452
You should be, I don't know.

00:46:28.452 --> 00:46:35.012
Look at these horrible people who are not
at all connected with God.

00:46:35.012 --> 00:46:36.212
They have nothing to do.

00:46:36.212 --> 00:46:42.331
Yesterday that lady, she gives Me a lecture
that "Why don't you praise the Lord?," you

00:46:42.331 --> 00:46:43.331
see.

00:46:43.331 --> 00:46:45.032
She's giving Me a lecture.

00:46:45.032 --> 00:46:52.432
So it is just a sort of a assumption that
"I am something great" that makes you ego,

00:46:52.432 --> 00:46:57.012
but that is also a Maya, because you have
to learn.

00:46:57.012 --> 00:47:05.432
Ultimately, your ego breaks and you understand
that "Oh, a Humpty-Dumpty it was."

00:47:05.432 --> 00:47:08.992
Once you discover that, "I don't want to have
an ego any more."

00:47:08.992 --> 00:47:12.752
I mean there are some Sahaja Yogis who refuse
to do any work of Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:12.752 --> 00:47:13.752
I said, "Why?"

00:47:13.752 --> 00:47:18.372
"Mother, we are too intelligent and our intelligence
cheats us and we'll develop ego."

00:47:18.372 --> 00:47:21.002
I said, "Now this is an escape.

00:47:21.002 --> 00:47:27.442
It won't, Sahaja Yoga can never give you ego,
but will give you joy.

00:47:27.442 --> 00:47:29.442
If it is giving you ego, it's not Sahaj.

00:47:29.442 --> 00:47:31.671
It should just give you joy.

00:47:31.671 --> 00:47:37.421
Giving somebody to Realization or somebody
you're curing, somebody being kind, anything,

00:47:37.421 --> 00:47:39.641
it just gives you satisfaction and you enjoy.

00:47:39.641 --> 00:47:40.641
It's a fact.

00:47:40.641 --> 00:47:45.562
I mean, you have come all the way here, you
are playing such good music, all this.

00:47:45.562 --> 00:47:48.702
Now you learnt Indian style, I don't know
how.

00:47:48.702 --> 00:47:50.712
Anybody should be very full of ego.

00:47:50.712 --> 00:47:54.462
But no, in the Maya of your Mother, you just
enjoy.

00:47:54.462 --> 00:47:56.982
Maya should give you enjoyment.

00:47:56.982 --> 00:48:03.492
That's the best thing that this Maya can give,
and you can enjoy it so much.

00:48:03.492 --> 00:48:16.831
I think it is a very beautiful atmosphere
created by this Mahamaya.

00:48:16.831 --> 00:48:21.381
So you can enjoy each other, you can enjoy
My company, you can enjoy nature.

00:48:21.381 --> 00:48:28.591
Such a rapport, such a beautiful understanding
between everything else is there.

00:48:28.591 --> 00:48:34.322
Nobody is bothered as to who is higher, who
is lower, what is the position; how much money

00:48:34.322 --> 00:48:37.062
he has got or what he has got.

00:48:37.062 --> 00:48:38.732
Nothing, just you're all enjoying.

00:48:38.732 --> 00:48:44.932
If somebody has a talent, he enjoys because
he has a talent and the others also enjoy

00:48:44.932 --> 00:48:46.962
because he has talent.

00:48:46.962 --> 00:48:49.492
No jealousies, no rivalries, nothing.

00:48:49.492 --> 00:48:50.752
Somebody sings better, all right.

00:48:50.752 --> 00:48:53.901
They'll tell Me, "Mother, You know, he sings
very well."

00:48:53.901 --> 00:49:03.661
There's one fellow in Paris and he is, I think
he's a black, from the black side, because

00:49:03.661 --> 00:49:08.212
he has very curly hair, a very nice boy.

00:49:08.212 --> 00:49:11.542
So, suddenly, somebody came from Italy.

00:49:11.542 --> 00:49:13.581
"Mother, do You know he dances very well?"

00:49:13.581 --> 00:49:14.581
"How do you know?"

00:49:14.581 --> 00:49:15.581
"I've seen him dancing."

00:49:15.581 --> 00:49:17.881
"So when did you see me dancing?" he asked.

00:49:17.881 --> 00:49:20.612
"You know, you came to that program.

00:49:20.612 --> 00:49:21.612
I saw that."

00:49:21.612 --> 00:49:22.782
In a group he saw him.

00:49:22.782 --> 00:49:25.321
He just got hold of him, "You'd better dance
before Mother."

00:49:25.321 --> 00:49:29.582
It was so much, you see, so joy-giving, this
kind of thing.

00:49:29.582 --> 00:49:37.301
He saw him in some sort of a program where
they were at least two thousand people dancing.

00:49:37.301 --> 00:49:39.232
He picked him out.

00:49:39.232 --> 00:49:45.641
Now, he's from Paris, and he's from Italy,
and how his eyes picked him up and he brought

00:49:45.641 --> 00:49:46.641
him.

00:49:46.641 --> 00:49:47.641
"Mother.

00:49:47.641 --> 00:49:48.641
You'd better dance before Mother, must!

00:49:48.641 --> 00:49:49.782
You are very good."

00:49:49.782 --> 00:49:50.942
And he was.

00:49:50.942 --> 00:49:53.942
But you see I might have missed it or whatever
it is.

00:49:53.942 --> 00:49:56.551
And even if I'd seen it I may not have asked
him.

00:49:56.551 --> 00:50:01.111
But this fellow went down there, and he's
got hold of him and he out put him here.

00:50:01.111 --> 00:50:04.472
I mean, these things are so joy-giving, you
see.

00:50:04.472 --> 00:50:12.032
It is otherwise, in the normal course, what
one would do, come before Me and start dancing,

00:50:12.032 --> 00:50:15.752
whether know or not and try to show off.

00:50:15.752 --> 00:50:16.752
Normally.

00:50:16.752 --> 00:50:22.442
But the one who knows never brought like that,
"Now, come along" and in such an impersonal

00:50:22.442 --> 00:50:25.222
way he saw him and brought him.

00:50:25.222 --> 00:50:32.351
It makes no difference whether they're from
Russia, or from America, or from India.

00:50:32.351 --> 00:50:36.661
So all these differences which are skin deep
are finished.

00:50:36.661 --> 00:50:42.351
And I find everybody appreciates everybody's
talent, everybody, how he speaks and suddenly,

00:50:42.351 --> 00:50:45.121
you'll find someone say, "Oh, he's such a
gem."

00:50:45.121 --> 00:50:46.682
"When did you meet him?"

00:50:46.682 --> 00:50:48.472
"No, I've heard about him."

00:50:48.472 --> 00:50:56.942
You see, all this appreciation and all this
beautiful feeling for others, you see, is

00:50:56.942 --> 00:50:58.242
only possible through Sahaj.

00:50:58.242 --> 00:51:00.661
No jealousies, no rivalries, nothing.

00:51:00.661 --> 00:51:06.372
These come because of an ignorance, which
creates the Maya about yourself, also: "I

00:51:06.372 --> 00:51:07.372
am this.

00:51:07.372 --> 00:51:08.881
I am that."

00:51:08.881 --> 00:51:12.252
And then the "I" comes down like that.

00:51:12.252 --> 00:51:16.522
So all conditionings also can create a Maya.

00:51:16.522 --> 00:51:20.651
Many conditionings are there that "I am from
such a family.

00:51:20.651 --> 00:51:22.352
I am from such a thing."

00:51:22.352 --> 00:51:24.182
That all has to be stopped.

00:51:24.182 --> 00:51:30.492
So today's special day is this of New Year's
where they said, "Now, today's the most auspicious

00:51:30.492 --> 00:51:36.551
day to start something new," and this Mahamaya's
dissolving has to be started.

00:51:36.551 --> 00:51:38.621
Gradually, you should try to understand.

00:51:38.621 --> 00:51:42.321
Many people ask Me, "Mother, how did You do
it?"

00:51:42.321 --> 00:51:43.321
Forget it.

00:51:43.321 --> 00:51:44.321
It's Mahamaya.

00:51:44.321 --> 00:51:45.321
Forget it.

00:51:45.321 --> 00:51:46.661
How did I do it?

00:51:46.661 --> 00:51:48.581
Just forget it.

00:51:48.581 --> 00:51:50.121
That part you need not go into.

00:51:50.121 --> 00:51:51.232
Just enjoy.

00:51:51.232 --> 00:51:55.671
Just enjoy that you are in that Maya and you
are enjoying it.

00:51:55.671 --> 00:51:59.492
It's the best way to enjoy this Mahamaya.

00:51:59.492 --> 00:52:02.742
And today, for the first time, we have this
Puja of Mahamaya.

00:52:02.742 --> 00:52:08.802
Because of Gudipadwa, I thought something
unique must be done which encompasses everything

00:52:08.802 --> 00:52:11.871
of Sahaja Yoga, everything of Sahaja Yoga.

00:52:11.871 --> 00:52:19.222
It's not one incarnation, it's not one nadi,
it's not one Goddess, but all of it is there.

00:52:19.222 --> 00:52:29.171
It's sometimes I say like a film is audio,
visual, everything is there - drama, music,

00:52:29.171 --> 00:52:31.071
also acting.

00:52:31.071 --> 00:52:32.752
Everything is there in a film now.

00:52:32.752 --> 00:52:36.222
I mean that far, everything integrated.

00:52:36.222 --> 00:52:45.992
In the same way, I think Mahamaya has everything
in it: every part that you tell Me, everything

00:52:45.992 --> 00:52:49.492
that you enjoy, everything that you discover.

00:52:49.492 --> 00:52:54.571
Everything is in that vision of Mahamaya,
which has been created for you.

00:52:54.571 --> 00:52:55.212
May God bless you.
