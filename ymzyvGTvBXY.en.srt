1
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:12,090
Today I am feeling rather sad [that] had to
say something, hard things yesterday and you

2
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:19,580
know [a] mother is like that (Mother is referring
to a lecture in Marathi the previous day).

3
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:24,869
You have to correct your children, you have
to tell them something, but you don’t like

4
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:31,060
it and you have to really put up yourself
to that point, that you can say something

5
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,780
to your children.

6
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:42,519
And the effect was good they said, but I didn’t
want them to cry or weep.

7
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:47,719
I want them to be corrected, to understand
the responsibility that they have.

8
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:58,280
We have to understand that we have a responsibility
towards Sahaja Yoga; and that is, if you understand

9
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:04,390
the first responsibility, is that you have
to be very good Sahaja Yogis to begin with;

10
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,580
that’s the greatest.

11
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:11,080
I have seen some very little girls also are
very show-offs: they’ll be the first to

12
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:17,430
sit further, they’ll be attracting my attention,
doing these things.

13
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,370
So they have to be told to behave themselves.

14
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:28,630
There are so many things like that which are
to be told to your children also.

15
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:35,610
Like today so many leaders came and they also
told me what is happening in India now, specially

16
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:45,450
in Maharashtra – but I think it is all over
– that they are taking to Western life,

17
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,430
sitting before the mirror, all the time dressing
up, thinking about their beauty, this, that.

18
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,300
I mean, it was never done before.

19
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,940
And the mothers allow them to do because they
don’t want to face them.

20
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:05,350
And then they see bad pictures and bad films
and things like that, and then they have a

21
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:09,501
bad effect of these bad films and they try
to follow: at the age of sixteen years they

22
00:02:09,501 --> 00:02:13,290
want to fall in love or something like that.

23
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,370
All this nonsense is coming, I know that this
filmmaking is a very dangerous thing these

24
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,370
days.

25
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:24,540
They are making all kinds of films to show
that a sixteen year old girl and an eighteen

26
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,150
year old boy run away from the house because
they are ‘in love’.

27
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,099
And what do they understand of it?

28
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:36,129
No maturity of any kind to have a good married
life.

29
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:39,329
But for a born-realised children it is different.

30
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:41,849
They are very different.

31
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:46,959
Because I have seen the reaction of my own
grandchildren, how they react.

32
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:57,951
So, like one of them said to me, “Can you
imagine grandma that in our gardens, one young

33
00:02:57,951 --> 00:03:02,870
man running, another young woman running after
him, dancing in the garden and kissing.

34
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,310
Is it possible?

35
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,180
The stupid things they do in the films!”

36
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,060
They make fun of all these things.

37
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:17,760
The youngest one, he came once to Cabella
and there was some film made, of one actress,

38
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,010
‘Mandakini’ or something.

39
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,939
She’s a Muslim lady, but she calls herself
‘Mandakini’.

40
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:24,950
“Never see her films!” he says, “very
bad, very bad!”

41
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,150
I said, “What happened?”

42
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,950
“Do you know what she did?

43
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:32,370
She went into the River Ganges with very thin
clothes and she came out and she insulted

44
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,370
all of us.

45
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,370
We don’t see her film."

46
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,579
I said, “Really?

47
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:38,420
But must be, I said, the director."

48
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,840
“Yes, that horrible Raj Kapoor, he’s the
worst.

49
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,590
Thank God he’s dead now."

50
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,590
Imagine!

51
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,790
Even when they were young their reactions
were like this.

52
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,670
Even I have seen my elder one.

53
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,719
She was engaged.

54
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:01,090
She was thinking she’ll select her own.

55
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,919
She wanted to marry somebody and she only
stuck onto one fellow to see him, but to the

56
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,489
end she was saying, “I don’t want to get
engaged till I see this man thoroughly.

57
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:11,340
I have not seen him."

58
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,349
I mean she never gave in fully.

59
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:17,470
So I was we are never bothered about it.

60
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,640
Whenever they are they behave in such a manner.

61
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,030
Like another one in Delhi I asked her, “Why
do you wear these khadi clothes all the time?

62
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,500
Can’t you wear something better?

63
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,880
What will people think, that we don’t give
you any money?”

64
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,260
She said, “No, it’s better.

65
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,440
Nobody looks at you.

66
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,840
It’s a very good idea."

67
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,130
So this is a sign of a really born-realised.

68
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:42,370
I have studied all of them, my grandson and
three children.

69
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,060
There’s no question.

70
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,420
They are so moral, so moral!

71
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:52,670
And we never told them these things.

72
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:56,970
We never told them that, “This is good,”
or, “that good,” or, “you should not

73
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:57,970
do this."

74
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,690
They, themselves [understand].

75
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:07,780
Then my sister’s grandson the other day
we met, he’s only a five year old boy, born-realised.

76
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:15,460
So in Sahaja Yoga we don’t eat paan, so
my sister, another sister, he calls as all

77
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,250
of us as ‘grandmas’, she ate the paan.

78
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,110
He just started fighting, “Why do you eat
paan?

79
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,110
Dirty thing.

80
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,110
Throw away!

81
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,110
I will have nothing to do.

82
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,110
I am kutti with you!”

83
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,110
Means I am now finished with it.

84
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,460
Five year old!

85
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,460
He protested.

86
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,650
And then he suddenly started crying.

87
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,310
I said, “Why are you crying now?”

88
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,740
“All of them are eating paan.

89
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,810
They are all bad people.

90
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,860
I don’t want to have them here!”

91
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,540
I mean in the marriage, they were eating paan!

92
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,560
So, he said he made everybody throw away their
paan!

93
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,230
So I told him, “There are people who don’t
eat paan, don’t take cigarettes and don’t

94
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,440
drink and they are with us.

95
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,550
They are called Sahaja Yogis."

96
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,710
“I am a Sahaja Yogi!” he said.

97
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,250
“I am a Sahaja Yogi!

98
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,840
Well, why do you tolerate, grandma, all these
people?

99
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,160
Tell them off!

100
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,810
They have no business to eat paan."

101
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,370
I was surprised [at] a five year old child.

102
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:10,170
Maybe, you might say, it’s my relationship
or my blood in them or whatever it is.

103
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:15,870
They are really remarkably moral people, remarkably,
for their age.

104
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:22,490
Also they are moral not only for themselves,
but also their friends and everyone, extremely

105
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:27,910
moral.

106
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:32,130
They don’t like people sitting before the
mirror for hours together, never.

107
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,910
They said, “They must be bhoots."

108
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,640
“We had a lady who was working in our house."

109
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,060
She said, “She doesn’t clean my bathroom,
she’s just looking at the mirror and looking

110
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,060
at herself!”

111
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,770
I said, “Isn’t she frightened of herself?”

112
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,530
All kinds of things!

113
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:51,560
They make such fun of all the films, such
films you see.

114
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:58,030
They have seen once there was one film which
my daughters had seen five times, making fun

115
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,190
of the whole thing.

116
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,570
You know, they really make fun of all that.

117
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:05,440
So once my husband had to see that film with
other relations in Calcutta.

118
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,440
He came back.

119
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,170
He said, “Never see that film again!

120
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,970
Never send those children to that film!”

121
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,340
They had already seen it five times!

122
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,240
But such a reaction, you know.

123
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:24,500
They never take to modern ideas [like] answering
back to parents and, “I’ll do what I like!”

124
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,500
Why?

125
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,850
Why don’t they do it?

126
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:32,550
And to me they are absolutely subservient.

127
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,470
If I am having the bath, they’ll put on
the radio.

128
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:40,860
If I come out, they are sitting there with
a towel and powder for my feet.

129
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,550
All the time they are worried about me, why?

130
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:51,080
Not about their parents, so much as they are
worried about me.

131
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,240
This is because they are born realised and
the children who are not, these are half-way

132
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,450
children, they are like that: they get impressed
by this Western thing and all that.

133
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:04,220
So the parents should see and tell them, “What
is this nonsense?”

134
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,100
So many things I can tell you about them.

135
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:11,960
I have been studying them and I was worried
that if these children were not born in my

136
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,770
family, what would have happened to them?

137
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:19,230
They don’t like to hear any funny songs
– nothing.

138
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:23,840
Once, early in the morning, my daughter was
playing some ghazals.

139
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,230
so she got up and came in the room.

140
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,230
She said, “What’s this going on, early
in the morning, crying, crying?

141
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,230
What is this?”

142
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,230
So I said, “This is ghazal."

143
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:36,940
“What a puzzle, early in the morning, to
make everyone weep!”

144
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:41,830
You see, these Lucknow people and all those
are very ghazalias: only in the mind.

145
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:48,640
They never love their wives, never do anything
for them, but they are romantic type.

146
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,950
And these girls know about it.

147
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:53,990
“And we Lucknowas.

148
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,070
We don’t want to marry these!

149
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:01,910
They’re just romancing in their heads and
they don’t love their wives and the wives

150
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,110
also don’t love."

151
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,110
So this is what it is.

152
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,680
I mean, they are so mature.

153
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:16,210
These two were studying in Patna and they
had only one chappal (sandal) left with them,

154
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,520
which was half broken.

155
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,800
So I told, “All right, come along with me
to Delhi.

156
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,660
I’ll buy good chappals for you."

157
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,960
I took them there.

158
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,550
They wouldn’t buy another one.

159
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,820
“One chappal is only.

160
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,680
One chappal and one chappal."

161
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,980
I said, “Why you have come all the way just
to buy only one chappal?”

162
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,220
“Yes, when this will break we will buy another
one."

163
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,220
And the clothes?

164
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,220
Nothing!

165
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,540
I forced on them their clothes.

166
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,540
They wouldn’t take it.

167
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,540
They said, “No, no, no, no!

168
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,540
There’s no need to spend.

169
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,630
Why do you want to spend?

170
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,940
Already we have got so much loan on our head,
of our parents.

171
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:54,529
And why do you want to spend more money?”

172
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:55,529
Even grandson.

173
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,840
He said, “My school is so bad!

174
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,240
All the girls want to talk to me."

175
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,010
And now he’s head of the class, school also.

176
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,060
They’re so wise, so sensible.

177
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:12,110
And it’s an example, before you to see that
your children don’t take to stupid things

178
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,140
of so called romance and all that.

179
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:20,500
They don’t believe in all that.

180
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:27,110
Today I have to tell you because I have got
reports of some girls who have been misbehaving,

181
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,310
sitting before the [mirror].

182
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,310
Why?

183
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,310
Why so much?

184
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:37,570
And I don’t know, I can’t face mirror
for more than for two minutes at the most.

185
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:42,420
Not because I think I have something wrong
with me, but the vibrations start hitting

186
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:46,730
me!

187
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,700
I don’t know how I look or what.

188
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,200
Why should you worry so much?

189
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,580
We should be confident, have self-respect.

190
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:03,680
All is accepted, dirty, filthy, from the West.

191
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,130
And in Sanskrit, as you know I have told you,
they were called as mlecchas.

192
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,860
Mleccha: mala-iccha.

193
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:15,050
They want all dirt and filth, that’s what.

194
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,730
Iccha is the desire; and they take to it.

195
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:22,070
Even in the Muslim culture that is there,
that’s why in Lucknow and all that, I used

196
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:26,070
to get suffocated the way people were romantic.

197
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,070
No sense of proportion.

198
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,310
But, thank God now, Lucknow has changed so
much.

199
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:35,589
I am really amazed how these people just looking
at women: every woman they must see, turn

200
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:36,589
their head at every woman.

201
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:41,630
I mean, their necks might break one day.

202
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,090
But in the West, I have seen, all women look
at the men!

203
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:49,280
First I didn’t understand what is going
on.

204
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,920
All the time like this, like this, like this.

205
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,670
And then they end up in a lunatic asylum.

206
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,220
What will happen otherwise also?

207
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,260
We are Sahaja Yogis.

208
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,770
We have our own traditions.

209
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,370
We are people of very high families.

210
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,870
Why should we take to these dirty things?

211
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:12,170
So I would request you to tell your children
not to be impressed by this dirty, horrible

212
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,370
culture that has evolved.

213
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,240
It was not so bad in the West.

214
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,450
I tell you, it was not.

215
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:26,920
It is now ruined; the whole place They have
no idea as to how filthy it has become.

216
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:37,370
If you are real Sahaja Yogis, you will be
very quiet, unassuming, dignified, mature,

217
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:41,839
as well as you will be very moral.

218
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,120
You have to be very [moral].

219
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,520
And you should only like people who are moral.

220
00:12:49,520 --> 00:13:00,160
This is not to be taught, but to be shown
to the children, how you yourself live.

221
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:09,490
If the mother is all the time busy with her
beauty and this and that, the child also takes

222
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,490
it.

223
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:25,180
All this filth and dirt should not settle
down, at least in Sahaja Yoga.

224
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:30,210
This is what today I wanted to tell you: [about]
these people, really I got worried.

225
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,300
They have no sense of music.

226
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,740
They don’t understand music.

227
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,570
They have no sense of Sahaja Yoga, nothing.

228
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:42,070
They are supposed to be your children!

229
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:49,100
Tomorrow the same children will definitely
cleanse the whole world, but what is your

230
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,100
attention is?

231
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,402
You are giving money to them to do what they
like.

232
00:13:53,402 --> 00:13:57,750
You are not putting your any attention.

233
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,920
Parents are there to correct their children.

234
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,550
They have to.

235
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,700
And if they argue, give them two tight slaps
and they will be all right.

236
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,920
In the West, also, the children are horrible,
absolutely horrible children.

237
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,709
They’ll go on asking you questions, “Why?

238
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:14,709
Why?”

239
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:17,110
Once I was travelling with a child like that
and the mother said, “What to do with this

240
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,110
child?”

241
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,720
I said, “You ask him: ‘Yesterday what
I answered, do you remember that?

242
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,220
Tell me what I answered you!’

243
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,800
” Since that day he stopped [asking] ‘why’.

244
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,350
Children shouldn’t talk so much.

245
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:31,620
They have no understanding of anything, still
little babies.

246
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,029
How are they to talk, as if they are wisdom
personified?

247
00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:38,080
This is all Western new method of educating
their children.

248
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,160
“Let them be what they want, they are free.

249
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,160
So what?”

250
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:48,089
With this method, no artist has been produced,
no musician has been produced, no composer

251
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:49,140
has been produced.

252
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,240
The whole quality has gone down.

253
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:58,820
First you need some discipline in life to
become something.

254
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:04,030
But also it’s very money-oriented in the
West, that if the boy has to clean the car,

255
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,650
you pay him £2.

256
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:10,589
No Sahaja Yogi should do that.

257
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:12,630
He has to do that.

258
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:15,220
He sits in the car, so why shouldn’t he
clean it?

259
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:19,029
He should feel, “This is my responsibility."

260
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:26,180
And a very big problem you will face if your
children turn out to be such horrible ones.

261
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:31,950
Of course, I am trying to make a school here
for the Sahaj children, but the parents should

262
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,209
not spoil them.

263
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:35,110
Same with the western people.

264
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:38,690
Now they have got their children, they are
so attached to their children.

265
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,480
They think it is their own property, they
can do what they like with them.

266
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,640
We made the school.

267
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,100
We paid for the school.

268
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,510
We collected everything, did all that.

269
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:51,900
They are very nicely coming here to take away
their children to their own countries.

270
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:57,250
They cannot think even that they are Sahaja
Yogis [and] they have to be in Ganapatipule

271
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,250
[even] if you are not.

272
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:05,220
They are not going to be like you that, for
some time, take all advantage of Sahaja Yoga

273
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:13,320
and then just become the same stupid fools.

274
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,300
So they decided to take away their children,
this, that.

275
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,751
I told Yogi, “Why are you sending the children
[home]?”

276
00:16:18,751 --> 00:16:20,130
He said, “The parents are…”

277
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:24,100
Who are the parents?

278
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,070
Who are the parents?

279
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,550
So this idea should not be there.

280
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,269
Children are to be involved in the main stream.

281
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:34,990
They should be in the main stream.

282
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,360
They should be here.

283
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,861
Otherwise, we have nothing to do with you
and your children.

284
00:16:38,861 --> 00:16:39,861
Get out!

285
00:16:39,861 --> 00:16:43,670
Now, I have to take a strong view of the whole
thing.

286
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:48,190
I find, specially in Australia, they are becoming
extremely secluded people.

287
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:53,500
Some of them are having, in the ashram, their
own rooms, their own television, their own

288
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,010
this thing, their own cooking.

289
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,590
This own business has to go away.

290
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:00,710
Throw away all such people from the ashrams.

291
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,310
I am surprised at Australians!

292
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:12,630
They got out of the jail and again want to
go into the same jail.

293
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:19,650
Next time all the children have to come to
Ganapatipule; next time, and nobody has to

294
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:20,980
[say], “We have booked their seats.

295
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,100
We have done that."

296
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,100
I told them, “Put them into trouble.

297
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,100
Tell them we can’t send the children.

298
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,670
Let them pay for that then they will understand."

299
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:38,690
Now the last, and not the least, is the way
still we are attached to money.

300
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,660
Sahaja Yoga is free, agreed.

301
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,370
Your Realisation is free.

302
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:54,110
But this time, can you believe, [on] the sixteenth
of November, I telephoned from Russia to find

303
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:58,890
out how much money was collected and there
was very little money there.

304
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:04,030
And such a big programme, such a difficult
programme and such an expensive programme

305
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,429
we had done.

306
00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:08,299
At the right time they let me down!

307
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:10,540
So I had to borrow money to have this programme.

308
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,540
Can you believe it?

309
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:20,480
They don’t feel responsible that they’re
troubling Mother like this!

310
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,890
I was not sure how many are coming, how many
are not coming.

311
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:28,680
First they said only two hundred coming, then
three hundred are coming, then I heard there

312
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,580
were six hundred!

313
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:43,470
Have you got a big bank account here that
you can just do what you like?

314
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,280
So they are not responsible.

315
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:57,600
Next time if you do not pay money till the
end of October, you are out of the tour!

316
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,679
Anywhere!

317
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:06,460
I cannot go on borrowing money like this every
time.

318
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,890
And then I have to return that money to my
husband.

319
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:15,170
It’s a fact!

320
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:18,690
Everybody knows.

321
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:28,770
[In] money matters, also, we have not yet
been able to be real Sahaja Yogis.

322
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:35,240
Now, this Shyamji, has bought these saris
on a little concession and he thought that

323
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,620
he will sell those and whatever concession
he gets it, he will give to Sahaja Yoga.

324
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:42,800
He’s a very honest man.

325
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:48,890
But because some saris were a little less
in price they were not [sold by] Sahaj Yogis,

326
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:53,700
nothing, and they were artificial saris, people
went and bought saris from him.

327
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,090
And none of them bought saris from Shyamji.

328
00:19:56,090 --> 00:20:02,230
They are very vain type.

329
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:06,860
Whatever is the little profit that he will
have, he gives it to me.

330
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,179
We have so much extra expenses.

331
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:15,280
You have no idea!

332
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,290
Same about presents.

333
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:20,840
The money, you people, you gave me about the
presents, also, is so delayed.

334
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:29,840
Just now we have taken thirty-five thousand
pounds, extra, for the musicians, which is

335
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,250
not yet paid back.

336
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:36,600
Here are [the] people, you can ask them, they
are dealing in the bank.

337
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,860
I have paid for this Chindwada house, four
lakhs of rupees already, not a single pie

338
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,929
(1/192 rupee) has been given so far, paid
for.

339
00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:48,010
We have to do so many things.

340
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,900
But so many Sahaja Yogis there are.

341
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,570
I tell them all, “Don’t give me any presents.

342
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,270
I don’t want any presents from you."

343
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:57,270
But you must pay for all these expenses which
are incurred.

344
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:02,920
Today is the first day I am talking about
it, because this time you really put me out

345
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,280
completely.

346
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,390
Absolutely, I was.

347
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:12,760
I didn’t know what will I do.

348
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,929
I never borrow money.

349
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:23,900
Partly I got from Italy and partly I borrowed:
Partly, quite a lot.

350
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,860
After all, everything needs money, you must
understand.

351
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:33,340
So, you see, next time if you do all these
things I’ll cancel the tours.

352
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:41,640
Please, by the end of October, remember all
your money should be there.

353
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:49,230
It’s not proper to say all these things
to you, I know, but you should also know what

354
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,330
trouble I am going through.

355
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,330
For doing what?

356
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:55,760
For your Realisation, for your tours, for
your everything.

357
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:02,040
I don’t need Sahaja Yoga do I?

358
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:16,100
Also, the last thing is this, as I have said,
money is needed just now, but maybe, might

359
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:22,169
be, something might [be] worked out when you
won’t need so much money; may.

360
00:22:22,169 --> 00:22:32,620
It will only work out if you people are sincere.

361
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,160
So many things are to be done here, also.

362
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,049
Of course, I have given a lot of money here.

363
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:42,299
In these four years, I have been able to save
a lot of money, I must say; compared to previous

364
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:46,170
years when you people were managing the money.

365
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,170
Since then I have saved.

366
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:50,200
Because money doesn’t have legs to walk
out!

367
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,800
If you don’t spend, it is there!

368
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,540
“My children, my wife, my house, my everything."

369
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:06,980
What about “my Sahaj Yoga”?

370
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:18,380
It’s your responsibility now: you need it,
your family needs it, your country needs it.

371
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,660
Everybody needs it.

372
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,799
So it is your responsibility.

373
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:29,010
Please understand that you have got Sahaja
Yoga because you are special people.

374
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:33,880
But the speciality is that you are responsible
for the whole world.

375
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,740
Spreading Sahaja Yoga is all right, but to
be responsible.

376
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:49,730
On the whole, of course, it has been really
a very good working out, I agree, but still

377
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:58,870
these are things that are missing which must
be somehow or other corrected: by the leaders,

378
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:03,360
by the world leaders, and coordinated.

379
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,580
It should be done.

380
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,049
After all, you know my age now.

381
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:10,900
You don’t want to trouble me.

382
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:18,059
This is the only kindness I need: not to go
on postponing things, not to go on being irresponsible,

383
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:19,570
that’s all!

384
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:24,049
I have been telling you for the last fifteen
years [that] I don’t want any presents!

385
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:27,470
For presents, for saris, everybody’s anxious.

386
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:32,960
Now this time every country wanted to give
me [a] sari.

387
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,179
Just imagine!

388
00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:36,620
I don’t need that.

389
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:42,110
I don’t know what I will do with it.

390
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:49,190
But full attention to yourself and to the
collective work and to the global work.

391
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:56,580
If I stop this work, it’s very easy, but
you don’t want that.

392
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,390
Even few are coming, whatever it is.

393
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,930
Definitely you tell me [that] so many are
coming – finished!

394
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:06,910
It’s hardly two, three years more, at the
most it will continue.

395
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:10,299
It cannot go on forever.

396
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:17,100
We’ll have to think of something else.

397
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:26,020
And my own style is that, whatever you give
for my pujas, I keep it for Sahaja Yoga only:

398
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:31,440
for the buying of silver, this, that.

399
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,580
So much of silver I have given, so much gold
that is here is my own.

400
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,850
Everything, most of the ornaments are my own.

401
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:42,470
Now what else I should do?

402
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:49,370
Not that I want anything from you, but you
should be responsible and understand.

403
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:51,210
All of you should, please.

404
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:56,020
If you can really think that this is so important.

405
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:01,220
Twelve disciples of Christ worked out Christianity
– only twelve.

406
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:07,760
And they were fishermen: how they did it!

407
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:16,000
All right, so everybody is telling me that,
“Mother you must talk to them and tell them

408
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
about it."

409
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,460
So I have told you.

410
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,289
I have done my job.

411
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:26,480
Now it is for you to think what is good and
what should be done.

412
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:32,740
Sahaja Yoga is your own: is for your children,
is for your family, is for the country, not

413
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,930
only [that, but] for the whole world, where
you live.

414
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:37,450
You are such a great people who are realised-souls.

415
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:43,470
Where are the realised-souls here?

416
00:26:43,470 --> 00:28:52,250
So have self-esteem, then you will feel responsible,
you know, “I am responsible."

417
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:59,919
Thank you very much.

418
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:10,779
May God bless you.
