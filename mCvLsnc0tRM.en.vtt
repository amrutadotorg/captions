00:03:26.083 --> 00:03:27.667
REPORTER: This is Phil Malone for the County Show

00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:29.917
at the Victoria Centre in Palk Road in Wellingborough.

00:03:30.083 --> 00:03:33.542
With me is Mataji, who teaches Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.375
Now, Mataji, what exactly does this yoga involve?

00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:42.667
SHRI MATAJI: Sahaja means: “saha” means with, “ja” is born.

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.125
So whatever is born with you means spontaneous.

00:03:46.375 --> 00:03:51.375
It is a living process of the living force, which is surrounding us,

00:03:51.583 --> 00:03:54.959
which is everywhere, which pulsates in everything.

00:03:55.166 --> 00:03:57.291
And this happening is the breakthrough,

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.834
the ultimate breakthrough into our unconscious;

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.709
can be described psychologically.

00:04:02.917 --> 00:04:04.999
REPORTER: So some people call this self-realization.

00:04:05.166 --> 00:04:06.250
SHRI MATAJI: Same.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.041
REPORTER: Now, Your background is from a Christian family in India.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.083
Yes.

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:13.542
REPORTER: Is Your teaching involved with Christianity or not?

00:04:14.333 --> 00:04:15.333
SHRI MATAJI: It is, of course,

00:04:15.542 --> 00:04:18.417
because Christ is very important for Sahaja Yoga, no doubt.

00:04:18.667 --> 00:04:20.999
But the way we understand Christ

00:04:21.166 --> 00:04:24.041
out of the text of Bible is very limited.

00:04:24.291 --> 00:04:27.667
We have to see to other texts about Him, and expand,

00:04:27.917 --> 00:04:30.000
and explain Him, what He meant,

00:04:30.208 --> 00:04:32.583
because Bible is not sufficient to explain Him.

00:04:32.917 --> 00:04:35.250
REPORTER: So, is Your message one of peace and that’s, in that case,

00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:37.458
peace in the rest of the world or peace within people?

00:04:37.667 --> 00:04:38.999
SHRI MATAJI: Absolutely.

00:04:39.166 --> 00:04:41.792
Peace within will only bring the peace outside.

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:44.667
Whatever we are inside is expressed outside.

00:04:44.875 --> 00:04:46.917
REPORTER: Now, You have had some successes

00:04:47.083 --> 00:04:51.208
in curing people or healing people in the past.

00:04:51.417 --> 00:04:55.625
Is this because You work from the inside out or how do You do it?

00:04:55.875 --> 00:04:58.250
SHRI MATAJI: It’s just very simple because

00:04:58.542 --> 00:05:02.542
you have the vitality, that Force is vitality itself.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.917
And once you have that flowing through you,

00:05:05.083 --> 00:05:08.417
if you give that vitality to someone, that person is revitalized.

00:05:08.625 --> 00:05:10.458
In simple words you can say like that.

00:05:10.667 --> 00:05:14.709
But actually it is a happening within you which takes place.

00:05:14.917 --> 00:05:17.917
There is a residual force, the germinating force you can call it,

00:05:18.083 --> 00:05:19.667
or the ascending force within you,

00:05:19.875 --> 00:05:25.583
which rises and gives you the experience of your Spirit.

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:28.083
Means your Spirit comes into your attention,

00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:31.458
means you can feel it on your central nervous system.

00:05:31.667 --> 00:05:34.166
So you receive the information

00:05:34.375 --> 00:05:37.291
or, we can say, you become enlightened by the Spirit,

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.792
which is the Absolute.

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:42.333
Once you receive the Absolute, as a by-product of that

00:05:42.583 --> 00:05:45.875
all these things drop out, all your maladjustments and everything.

00:05:46.041 --> 00:05:48.041
REPORTER: Now, tonight You’re appearing in Northampton

00:05:48.375 --> 00:05:49.583
at the Guildhall.  SHRI MATAJI: Yes.

00:05:49.792 --> 00:05:52.000
REPORTER: If people went along,

00:05:52.208 --> 00:05:54.625
what would You have to say to them tonight?

00:05:54.834 --> 00:05:57.834
SHRI MATAJI: I’ll have to explain to them what actually they are.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.750
Actually they are the Spirit,

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:01.417
and this body, mind

00:06:01.625 --> 00:06:04.458
and all these things are just the covering.

00:06:04.667 --> 00:06:07.500
Now our attention is at our body level,

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.500
at the level of our mind, or emotions.

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:14.041
But you have to go beyond, and with this happening it happens.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.125
When it happens, you become the twice-born, as they call it,

00:06:17.333 --> 00:06:21.208
like an egg becoming a bird the transformation takes place.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.834
REPORTER: So this second birth coming, some people

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.333
perhaps they believe this would happen when they die.

00:06:27.542 --> 00:06:29.625
SHRI MATAJI: It’s not possible. How can that be?

00:06:29.834 --> 00:06:32.208
That’s a misunderstanding. There are lots of misunderstandings

00:06:32.417 --> 00:06:34.834
we have about these things, which can be removed.

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:39.125
First logically we have to reach certain conclusions, logically.

00:06:39.417 --> 00:06:43.291
So that we don’t put our brain a complete stop,

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.667
we see through our logical understanding

00:06:45.875 --> 00:06:49.125
that what we have to achieve, if it’s a living force.

00:06:49.333 --> 00:06:51.291
Then we achieve it.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.625
Once we achieve it, then we have to verify it

00:06:53.834 --> 00:06:58.000
if it is so or not. It’s all absolutely open.

00:06:58.291 --> 00:07:00.458
REPORTER: So, are Your followers then…

00:07:00.667 --> 00:07:03.417
how do they practice this form of yoga?

00:07:03.625 --> 00:07:06.792
I mean, do they do it in conjunction with other religions, for example?

00:07:06.999 --> 00:07:08.917
SHRI MATAJI: You see, these religions that you see,

00:07:09.083 --> 00:07:11.750
outside they look like different religions

00:07:12.041 --> 00:07:14.041
but actually they are one.

00:07:14.375 --> 00:07:18.667
All these are flowers out of one tree of life.

00:07:18.834 --> 00:07:21.417
They are different flowers to look at, but they are not.

00:07:21.625 --> 00:07:23.917
They are living on the same truth,

00:07:24.083 --> 00:07:25.834
there’s no difference at all between them.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.542
But when you pluck them and call them “this is mine, this is mine,”

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.625
they become dead, ugly, and funny.

00:07:32.834 --> 00:07:36.583
That’s how fanaticism has come. All religions are born out of truth

00:07:36.792 --> 00:07:41.333
and here you find the integration of them, complete integration.

00:07:41.542 --> 00:07:43.792
REPORTER: Well, You’ll be meeting with people from Northampton

00:07:43.999 --> 00:07:46.125
and from the rest of the county in the Guildhall tonight

00:07:46.333 --> 00:07:47.417
and thank You very much for speaking with us.

00:07:47.625 --> 00:07:50.041
SHRI MATAJI: The address is:

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:54.291
Guildhall, St. Giles’ Square, Northampton.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.083
REPORTER: And it starts at about half past seven.

00:07:56.333 --> 00:07:57.959
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, half past seven it will start. I hope to see-

00:07:58.166 --> 00:08:00.417
REPORTER: Thank You very much. This is Phil Malone for the County Show

00:08:00.667 --> 00:08:03.417
at the Victoria Centre, Palk Road, in Wellingborough.

00:08:03.625 --> 00:08:06.625
SHRI MATAJI: Was that good? REPORTER: That’s great, that’s fine, yes, thanks very much.

00:08:06.834 --> 00:08:09.417
...take these flowers with You, all right.

00:08:09.917 --> 00:08:10.917
SHRI MATAJI: You should have asked about gurus,

00:08:11.083 --> 00:08:12.625
I think that’s important. REPORTER: [unclear].

00:08:12.834 --> 00:08:13.959
SHRI MATAJI: That’s very important, you know,

00:08:14.125 --> 00:08:16.875
because all the people are misled by gurus

00:08:17.041 --> 00:08:19.750
and all this hypnotic stuff, and black magic.

00:08:19.959 --> 00:08:22.792
You must save all these people. That’s very important.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
R: Yes, they get confused, do they?

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.917
SHRI MATAJI: Very much confused, you see, the confusion is so much.

00:08:27.083 --> 00:08:29.250
That’s the sign of modern times also.

00:08:29.458 --> 00:08:32.166
You must know what to expect. REPORTER: Mm, yes. Anyway all the best,

00:08:32.375 --> 00:08:33.583
Thanks very much indeed.

00:08:33.792 --> 00:08:34.959
REPORTER: Thank You, OK, [unclear]. SHRI MATAJI: Thank you very much.

00:08:35.125 --> 00:08:36.959
REPORTER: OK, Thank You, [UNCLEAR]. SHRI MATAJI: Sorry I was late,

00:08:37.125 --> 00:08:38.750
but yesterday was such a funny experience.

00:08:38.959 --> 00:08:39.875
We came down

00:08:40.125 --> 00:08:42.750
running out forty miles, and nothing happened.

00:08:42.999 --> 00:08:46.000
Thank you very much, thank you. Good-bye.
