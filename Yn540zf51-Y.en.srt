1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,418
[A little child calls loudly:
“Mataji! Jai!”.]

2
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:22,756
Today's puja we have arranged of Durga
or the Kali.

3
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:32,104
That is the destroying form of the Goddess
of all the evil and negativity.

4
00:00:32,305 --> 00:00:36,522
This we had to do it in France,

5
00:00:36,723 --> 00:00:44,931
because I feel very strongly that day
by day, in general,

6
00:00:45,132 --> 00:00:49,988
France is going down and down and down.

7
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:52,476
While you people are coming up,

8
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:57,839
the rest of the France is in the most
pitiable condition.

9
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:03,981
Firstly, as you understand, is the Catholic
church,

10
00:01:04,182 --> 00:01:09,367
which - perhaps you are not aware of,
perhaps maybe -

11
00:01:09,568 --> 00:01:14,857
because you don't read any other languages,

12
00:01:15,058 --> 00:01:20,807
you just read French compulsorily
by this country.

13
00:01:21,008 --> 00:01:28,299
So you have no international views
or international news

14
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:36,832
that this Catholic church has done
so many horrible things in the past,

15
00:01:37,033 --> 00:01:42,762
that is unbelievable that they have
anything to do with God.

16
00:01:42,963 --> 00:01:52,995
They burnt many cardinals in the hearth -
roasted them.

17
00:01:55,885 --> 00:01:59,913
Not only that, they killed so many people

18
00:02:00,114 --> 00:02:04,063
who ever tried to utter a word about them.

19
00:02:04,264 --> 00:02:08,923
They were much worse than Muslim people.

20
00:02:09,216 --> 00:02:14,079
They went to other countries like South
America, America -

21
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:21,644
all these places they're all Catholics -
even our country.

22
00:02:21,858 --> 00:02:29,850
And they killed millions and millions
of people.

23
00:02:33,074 --> 00:02:37,516
Now as this is Kruta Yuga that has started,

24
00:02:37,717 --> 00:02:40,863
one of the things as I said yesterday
is that:

25
00:02:41,064 --> 00:02:45,438
you will have to pay for whatever you
have done,

26
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:50,039
on mass scale or individual scale.

27
00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:55,797
If that is the case,

28
00:02:55,998 --> 00:03:00,183
then one must know that France has to pay
a lot

29
00:03:00,384 --> 00:03:05,897
and this Catholic church has to pay more.

30
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:11,567
Catholic church has just taken out yarns
out of their heads

31
00:03:11,768 --> 00:03:16,766
and started a theory of original sin.

32
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:22,040
That's how to condemn every other
Incarnation, every other Prophet -

33
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:24,749
that they were all with original sin.

34
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,982
And even they said Mary was born with
original sin,

35
00:03:28,183 --> 00:03:32,530
for many popes they were discussing it.

36
00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:40,401
This shows that this whole hocus-pocus
religion of Catholic church

37
00:03:40,602 --> 00:03:47,359
had to establish itself by forcing people,
by torturing them,

38
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:54,887
by taking all their ideas into their
own control,

39
00:03:55,088 --> 00:04:00,324
give them funny ideas like original sin.

40
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:07,701
Another is that you must confess, giving
them the left Vishuddhis.

41
00:04:07,923 --> 00:04:13,228
They treated women as nothing

42
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:17,561
and to Mother of Mary they called Her
a woman.

43
00:04:17,762 --> 00:04:21,414
And this Paul, as I told you yesterday,
is a fact.

44
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:25,647
Now it's necessary for Sahaja Yogis
to understand

45
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:34,705
how this Catholic church is so dangerous
and has been doing such harm.

46
00:04:34,906 --> 00:04:39,550
As there has been so many books about it -

47
00:04:39,751 --> 00:04:45,413
that you people don't read, because
it's not in French.

48
00:04:45,906 --> 00:04:51,903
There are English books from America -
you must learn English.

49
00:04:52,104 --> 00:04:55,962
It's very important now I feel, that
all the French must know English,

50
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:59,046
they must read English.

51
00:04:59,247 --> 00:05:04,187
French will not give you the international
personality

52
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:08,224
that you are supposed to acquire.

53
00:05:08,438 --> 00:05:12,126
You had some scholarship, not much.

54
00:05:12,327 --> 00:05:15,661
The real scholarship comes from England

55
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:23,614
and also from America in English language,
and also from India.

56
00:05:23,815 --> 00:05:29,150
One gentleman who tried to translate
all these things in UNESCO,

57
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:32,806
he was thrown out by your media.

58
00:05:33,013 --> 00:05:37,987
Your media is taking full advantage that
you don't read any other newspapers;

59
00:05:38,188 --> 00:05:41,546
they are doing whatever they feel like.

60
00:05:41,747 --> 00:05:49,187
All kinds of scandals, all kinds
of sensationalization -

61
00:05:49,388 --> 00:05:53,325
whatever they want to write, they write
in free press.

62
00:05:53,526 --> 00:05:58,809
On one side there's suppression of natural
life of human beings,

63
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,184
let them to go to Freud.

64
00:06:02,385 --> 00:06:05,887
When Freud is the dirtiest man you
could think of,

65
00:06:06,088 --> 00:06:09,255
who has put his ideas into your head.

66
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:16,210
But as if you are already brainwashed
people that you accepted all that.

67
00:06:16,411 --> 00:06:20,450
How could you accept Freud? If Freud
had come to India,

68
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:23,556
they would have killed him in no time!

69
00:06:23,757 --> 00:06:27,643
What happens is that, somehow or other -
I don't know what is the reason,

70
00:06:27,844 --> 00:06:32,248
I don't know where to place it, but
the wisdom is not there.

71
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:36,054
There is no maturity, there is no wisdom.

72
00:06:36,255 --> 00:06:40,871
America I can understand because it is only
two-three hundred years old.

73
00:06:41,072 --> 00:06:45,094
But what about the French? They have
not been able

74
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:50,139
to mature but they have become extremely
frivolous.

75
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,642
Maturity is finished.

76
00:06:53,843 --> 00:07:00,594
One of the reasons could be that they want
that you should be always young.

77
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:07,167
In India, young people are called
as stupid:

78
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:13,736
you call it gadha pachisi, means
at twenty-five years they are donkeys.

79
00:07:13,937 --> 00:07:19,784
They are never regarded as sensible people
to be followed.

80
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:27,612
And gradually by this movement from
Catholic church to Freud,

81
00:07:27,816 --> 00:07:31,540
what has happened that you haven't got
your own personality

82
00:07:31,741 --> 00:07:36,334
to understand what is right and what is
wrong.

83
00:07:36,535 --> 00:07:39,923
Of course, I must say Sahaja Yogis must
have done lots of punyas

84
00:07:40,124 --> 00:07:45,586
and must be very courageous people to be
born in this country.

85
00:07:45,787 --> 00:07:49,726
Otherwise I don't know how you could have
taken your birth here.

86
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:58,490
The law is so funny that they said it
depends on the mood of the magistrate,

87
00:07:58,691 --> 00:08:05,419
As if, you see, the magistrate doesn't
know the law.

88
00:08:06,015 --> 00:08:10,402
Such a stupid country in modern times
I've never known.

89
00:08:10,603 --> 00:08:14,072
Nowhere in the world there's such a stupid
law as it is here.

90
00:08:14,273 --> 00:08:18,330
Of course, in America, there is no justice,
they do what they like.

91
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:24,009
But here is so-called modern people.

92
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:28,418
What is their condition is that they have
no sense of law.

93
00:08:28,619 --> 00:08:31,096
If you ask them, "What is the law?"
They don't care.

94
00:08:31,297 --> 00:08:33,937
It's the mood of the magistrate.

95
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:38,342
Now supposing he has had a big drink
in the last night,

96
00:08:38,543 --> 00:08:42,957
second day he comes with a hangover,
so finished.

97
00:08:43,158 --> 00:08:50,213
And then he will be very much biased
towards the drunkards only.

98
00:08:50,859 --> 00:08:58,498
So, here it is becoming such a horrible
society

99
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:05,825
that Indians would be shocked, beyond
doubt, but nothing but prostitution.

100
00:09:11,006 --> 00:09:15,050
To see and to be seen.

101
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,604
Why?

102
00:09:17,805 --> 00:09:20,585
Every woman has to dress up in such a way

103
00:09:20,786 --> 00:09:27,468
that she should be attractive, for what?
Is she a prostitute?

104
00:09:30,014 --> 00:09:36,647
All kinds of bathroom cultures developed.

105
00:09:36,848 --> 00:09:42,992
For example French bath, you know what
it means, all over the world.

106
00:09:43,193 --> 00:09:49,552
It's a very dirty habit of laziness,
it comes because of drinking.

107
00:09:49,753 --> 00:09:53,382
If you drink too much, next morning you
are so lethargic

108
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:57,972
that you take just a French bath and
go away.

109
00:09:58,173 --> 00:10:00,676
So, please try to remember as French
Sahaja Yogis,

110
00:10:00,877 --> 00:10:06,386
that your task is much more difficult
than the task of other countries,

111
00:10:06,587 --> 00:10:14,708
because it lacks completely wisdom.

112
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:20,586
Neither you'll find in your institutions,
nor in your government,

113
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:28,420
nor in any education.

114
00:10:28,955 --> 00:10:33,856
It's lacking wisdom completely.

115
00:10:35,455 --> 00:10:39,194
And to have wisdom, according to these
Freudian people,

116
00:10:39,395 --> 00:10:43,462
is that you are egoistical!

117
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:51,294
They have such funny ideas from the yarn
of Mr. Freud

118
00:10:51,495 --> 00:10:56,469
that no sensible man would accept.

119
00:10:57,675 --> 00:11:03,396
But people have lost their senses,
and like blotting paper,

120
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:13,760
whatever is filthy, destructive, horrible,
subhuman, they try to absorb.

121
00:11:14,746 --> 00:11:18,936
Supposed to be Christian nation.

122
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:26,974
Please, all Sahaja Yogis must understand:

123
00:11:27,175 --> 00:11:33,250
you must get hold of books and find out,
where are we?

124
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:37,803
I worked very hard in France, you know
that very well.

125
00:11:38,004 --> 00:11:41,054
I used to think, this is the gate of hell.

126
00:11:41,255 --> 00:11:45,018
But it is much worse than that,

127
00:11:45,219 --> 00:11:50,290
it's a mire of filth. And you are born here

128
00:11:50,491 --> 00:11:56,848
and you have become like lotuses,
so fragrant and beautiful,

129
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,805
you'll have to fight it out.

130
00:12:00,006 --> 00:12:02,945
I am always with you, all My powers
with you.

131
00:12:03,146 --> 00:12:06,320
But remember that you have to fight
the society,

132
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:12,065
you have to save so many people, you have
to rescue them.

133
00:12:13,803 --> 00:12:16,758
Children are given liberty, "Do what
you like."

134
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,012
They have no sense of liberty!

135
00:12:20,213 --> 00:12:22,662
Supposing there's an aeroplane,

136
00:12:22,863 --> 00:12:25,665
which was not fixed properly and made
to fly.

137
00:12:25,866 --> 00:12:29,152
What will happen to the aeroplane?

138
00:12:29,353 --> 00:12:35,654
If the children are given liberty without
the right sense of their duty

139
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:40,596
and the right sense about themselves,
what will happen to them?

140
00:12:40,797 --> 00:12:47,954
Why children are born to parents?
It is to get spoiled,

141
00:12:48,155 --> 00:12:53,466
to have liberty or to get some guidance?

142
00:12:53,849 --> 00:12:57,371
You cannot guide your children.

143
00:12:57,572 --> 00:13:03,141
They are so rude, they are so arrogant.

144
00:13:03,342 --> 00:13:09,197
They have gone off, completely.

145
00:13:09,398 --> 00:13:13,110
You know for one month we had to struggle
with these western children.

146
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,539
And we had come to the point of urge
of closing down that school

147
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,849
because they were really violent children,

148
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,050
as if coming from some jungle.

149
00:13:24,257 --> 00:13:28,308
Even the jungle animals have some sense.

150
00:13:29,244 --> 00:13:32,974
So you have to think about your children.

151
00:13:33,175 --> 00:13:36,531
What's going to happen to your children?

152
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:40,622
What is going to be their situation?

153
00:13:40,995 --> 00:13:46,938
If they are going to live in the same
manner in this dirt,

154
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:54,413
these children will turn out to be waste,
just a waste!

155
00:13:54,614 --> 00:14:00,517
They will have no education, no character,
no personality,

156
00:14:00,718 --> 00:14:10,457
they'll end up with AIDS or with drugs
or something like that.

157
00:14:10,658 --> 00:14:16,829
I do not see any future for the children
of France, no future.

158
00:14:20,012 --> 00:14:25,417
And you have to fight that, "We want
to have future for our children,

159
00:14:25,618 --> 00:14:28,277
we don't want them to be ruined."

160
00:14:28,478 --> 00:14:32,494
And you must have courage to fight it.

161
00:14:32,695 --> 00:14:37,005
It's very important to have courage.

162
00:14:37,206 --> 00:14:42,297
If you do not have the courage, you cannot
fight it.

163
00:14:42,498 --> 00:14:48,564
And today's puja is to give that courage
in your hearts.

164
00:14:48,765 --> 00:14:54,644
See it all around you, what's happening?

165
00:14:54,845 --> 00:14:58,567
You are all nicely enjoying yourself
in the realm of God,

166
00:14:58,768 --> 00:15:00,666
you have entered into the Kingdom of God.

167
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:05,148
But what about the rest of the people?

168
00:15:05,366 --> 00:15:10,277
The majority of the people, where are they
going?

169
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:27,590
What is going to be the future of this
horrible Mooladhara place?

170
00:15:29,344 --> 00:15:34,953
Now Freud has been discovered
as a fraudulent man,

171
00:15:35,154 --> 00:15:38,067
and now there are books after so many
years,

172
00:15:38,268 --> 00:15:42,247
when he has already ruined the people
all over the world.

173
00:15:42,448 --> 00:15:46,928
But the worst of all, they have ruined
here.

174
00:15:51,068 --> 00:15:53,791
It's a responsibility specially
of the women I think,

175
00:15:53,992 --> 00:15:57,837
because they are responsible for
the society.

176
00:15:58,038 --> 00:16:03,414
The society of France has gone to dogs

177
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:10,030
and for you to now take up upon yourself

178
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:16,664
to talk against this kind of anarchy

179
00:16:16,865 --> 00:16:22,275
that is working out the destruction
of your families.

180
00:16:24,018 --> 00:16:32,572
If the women decide, I am sure, they
can very, very easily work it out.

181
00:16:32,773 --> 00:16:37,842
Instead of asking for liberation
nonsensical,

182
00:16:38,418 --> 00:16:43,067
you better ask for the ascent of this
country.

183
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:46,429
I know, I've worked very hard and you are
all there.

184
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,422
I am very happy to see that you all
are there

185
00:16:49,623 --> 00:17:01,277
to fulfill the desires of the Divine.

186
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:07,203
Because now you should know in a very
big way,

187
00:17:07,404 --> 00:17:13,235
masses of masses of people will be
destroyed.

188
00:17:17,014 --> 00:17:21,454
Not from without but from within.

189
00:17:23,188 --> 00:17:29,138
Suddenly you'll hear so many millions
disappear with this disease.

190
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:38,099
Also you must protect yourself, all of you:

191
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:45,817
always give yourself a bandhan; always
lead a clean life.

192
00:17:46,018 --> 00:17:52,244
There are certain hygienic rules of Sahaja
Yoga, please try to follow them.

193
00:17:52,445 --> 00:17:55,617
Do not neglect it.

194
00:17:55,818 --> 00:17:59,837
If somebody gets AIDS, you'll not have him
in Sahaja Yoga,

195
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:04,487
whatever may be the conditions, whatever
may be the reason.

196
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:11,980
You have to be very careful, also I would
say never treat a AIDS patient.

197
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:14,766
Like the one yesterday who was arguing
with Me,

198
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:19,083
actually because they have only two types
of people:

199
00:18:19,284 --> 00:18:26,310
one who are arrogant and another one
which always

200
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:33,322
think that it's better they should die.
They have no will to live.

201
00:18:33,523 --> 00:18:38,041
So there are only two types of people,
either right-sided or left-sided.

202
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:42,798
And they can never ascend. We have tried,
we have tried.

203
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:46,108
Of course, one person is living
for the last seven years,

204
00:18:46,346 --> 00:18:51,753
but still he has no faith in himself.

205
00:18:51,954 --> 00:18:57,259
Maybe next generation might be better on,
if they come back.

206
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,628
But as far as this generation is concerned,

207
00:19:01,829 --> 00:19:06,584
you should know your responsibility
is very great.

208
00:19:06,785 --> 00:19:11,528
All the Sahaja Yogis must take a vow

209
00:19:11,729 --> 00:19:16,565
that they'll fight this society and try
to save their country

210
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:22,331
and their countrymen from a complete
disaster.

211
00:19:22,532 --> 00:19:25,900
There is going to be no war,

212
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:31,168
only they will fight themselves and die.

213
00:19:33,144 --> 00:19:35,425
It's a very serious matter.

214
00:19:35,626 --> 00:19:41,002
For that, we decided to have this puja
of Durga today

215
00:19:41,203 --> 00:19:45,471
that all negativity should be destroyed.

216
00:19:45,672 --> 00:19:52,678
So many Deities build up the body of Kali.

217
00:19:52,879 --> 00:19:58,395
Every part of Her body was created
by a Deity, looked after by a Deity,

218
00:19:58,596 --> 00:20:06,380
and is also, later on, is reflected
in you all.

219
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:12,648
So they say that God has made human beings
in His own image,

220
00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:16,470
I would say, I've made you in My own
image,

221
00:20:16,671 --> 00:20:21,584
all the Deities at your disposal.

222
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:26,082
They're all with you, and they have created
you - if you see it minutely -

223
00:20:26,283 --> 00:20:31,572
it is the Deities who have brought forth
all the beauty that you had.

224
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:41,371
They have made all this beautiful
congregation, beautiful transformation,

225
00:20:41,572 --> 00:20:49,227
and they have created such angelic people
out of you.

226
00:20:49,903 --> 00:20:52,499
They are always working it out,

227
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:58,173
but one thing you have to do is to have
the drive.

228
00:20:58,374 --> 00:21:03,525
You had pure desire to ascend, but
for what?

229
00:21:03,726 --> 00:21:08,157
You want to have the light, but for what?

230
00:21:08,358 --> 00:21:12,304
You want to become gurus, for what?

231
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:17,098
To save people, for their salvation.

232
00:21:17,328 --> 00:21:20,742
Only through your channels I can work out
Sahaja Yoga.

233
00:21:20,943 --> 00:21:24,174
If I could work out Myself, I would have.

234
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:28,932
It's not question of killing one rakshasa.

235
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:34,048
God knows how many there are, rakshasas
and rakshasas.

236
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:40,255
And they are everywhere, even within you
they were.

237
00:21:40,456 --> 00:21:43,952
Now they have gone away.

238
00:21:47,296 --> 00:21:53,086
So you have to do full justice to Sahaja
Yoga, that's very important.

239
00:21:53,287 --> 00:21:56,281
I knew the puja would be very late,
because Kali's puja

240
00:21:56,482 --> 00:22:02,845
is always done in the night, after twelve.
So it had to be this way.

241
00:22:03,046 --> 00:22:05,480
Though last night I slept at four o'clock
and I,  tonight,

242
00:22:05,681 --> 00:22:12,676
I don't know what time I will sleep -
it all works out. It's all worked out.

243
00:22:12,877 --> 00:22:15,927
But you have to have deliberations
and you have to think,

244
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:18,740
“What can we do to change this?”

245
00:22:18,941 --> 00:22:25,731
Why not write some books, why not write
some experiences?

246
00:22:25,932 --> 00:22:31,450
Get them published in French only. Let
the French know what’s happening outside.

247
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:35,803
Get some of the books translated –

248
00:22:37,165 --> 00:22:43,419
some American books, some English books.
At least give quotations from there.

249
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:47,774
How they are unaware. First this Catholic
church has to go away.

250
00:22:47,975 --> 00:22:54,207
It will, no doubt, I am sure about it.
They are literally frightened of us.

251
00:23:00,122 --> 00:23:06,759
And we have to now really show them
what we are capable of.

252
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:16,563
And the funniest thing is that a president
has chosen

253
00:23:16,764 --> 00:23:19,131
his lady-friend as the prime minister.

254
00:23:19,332 --> 00:23:26,326
I mean, it’s not possible in any sensible
country. It’s never heard of.

255
00:23:26,527 --> 00:23:31,668
I must say, English are thousand times
better.

256
00:23:32,556 --> 00:23:34,994
They are really very good.

257
00:23:35,195 --> 00:23:39,054
At least, as far as administration
is concerned,

258
00:23:39,255 --> 00:23:43,217
as far as their parliament is concerned.
Their justice is not stupid like this,

259
00:23:43,418 --> 00:23:48,352
it’s based on law, not based on the mood
of a magistrate.

260
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:51,855
How you are still continuing with such
stupidity

261
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:56,772
which are really even before medieval age:

262
00:23:56,973 --> 00:24:02,876
primitive, people are absolutely primitive
to accept such laws.

263
00:24:03,077 --> 00:24:10,996
At least you can write a book about
the strange laws of French, one title.

264
00:24:15,206 --> 00:24:18,837
How it has harmed. There is a very nice
book, “Fraudulent Freud”.

265
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:23,420
Please read that, and see how Freud
has ruined the French,

266
00:24:23,621 --> 00:24:27,054
how their brains are twisted, how they
have twisted ideas.

267
00:24:27,255 --> 00:24:31,453
You are all so intelligent, clever people.

268
00:24:33,826 --> 00:24:41,189
So if not with the sword, Kali has to work
through the pen.

269
00:24:48,114 --> 00:24:54,210
I never knew it was in that bad shape,
though I knew it was.

270
00:24:55,671 --> 00:25:00,836
So this is a challenge for all of us,

271
00:25:01,037 --> 00:25:08,117
and let Me see what you can write, all
of you, put together your experiences:

272
00:25:08,318 --> 00:25:11,648
how the French parents behave, how
the grandparents behave,

273
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:16,089
what’s happening in this country and
all that.

274
00:25:21,391 --> 00:25:25,584
They are living in fool’s paradise.

275
00:25:27,702 --> 00:25:35,942
They don’t know how destruction is just
hanging over their heads.

276
00:25:39,755 --> 00:25:44,976
Though you are all saved, but you have
to think of others,

277
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:52,662
that is what Sahaja Yoga is, that is not
only that we care for the bhaktas –

278
00:25:52,863 --> 00:26:01,302
like Kali just wanted to protect
the bhaktas, the sadhakas.

279
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:11,034
But you have to protect many, many more
people.

280
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:17,973
You have all the powers, just assume them
and use them.

281
00:26:19,775 --> 00:26:22,729
You can do it.

282
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:26,289
Your media is the worst of all

283
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:30,781
and we can start a newspaper also calling
it anti-media.

284
00:26:30,982 --> 00:26:34,205
What can they do to us?

285
00:26:34,406 --> 00:26:39,603
Or some sort of an independent name,
we can give it.

286
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:43,724
And it should be open for people who
are suffering

287
00:26:43,925 --> 00:26:50,363
from media sensationalization.
They can write:

288
00:26:50,564 --> 00:26:54,358
how the media is harming them, how they
are giving false reports and things.

289
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,685
We can! Why not?

290
00:27:00,757 --> 00:27:03,986
I am sure it will work out.

291
00:27:05,567 --> 00:27:10,571
Think it over what you can do with
your pen.

292
00:27:14,303 --> 00:27:18,680
Whatever you have gained, whatever you
are enjoying: beautiful music,

293
00:27:18,881 --> 00:27:22,377
all the pujas, everything. But think
of others.

294
00:27:22,578 --> 00:27:29,071
They are already drunk and tossing
their heads on their pillows.

295
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:35,406
Think of them. They, when will they feel
this joy?

296
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:38,250
I simply feel pity for them

297
00:27:38,451 --> 00:27:42,809
that they should have taken to all these
bad things,

298
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:45,011
because of the suppression of the Catholic
church.

299
00:27:45,212 --> 00:27:47,419
It’s the Catholic church which has
suppressed them,

300
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,781
that’s why they have come to this.
No other way –

301
00:27:50,982 --> 00:27:55,420
reason why they should accept this kind
of thing.

302
00:27:59,709 --> 00:28:04,436
In Sahaja Yoga, we do not do all these
things, we are in the centre.

303
00:28:04,637 --> 00:28:08,658
We do not have this kind of problems,
because we don’t suppress anyone,

304
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:12,983
nor do we go to the other extreme
of indulgences.

305
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:16,633
I think the whole Europe can be divided
into two types of people:

306
00:28:16,834 --> 00:28:21,000
one are Anglo-Saxons, and others are
Latins.

307
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:26,094
Anglo-Saxons are right-sided and the Latins
are left-sided:

308
00:28:26,295 --> 00:28:33,691
they cry, weep, miserable, they indulge
into dirt and filth.

309
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,389
Just these two types they are.

310
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:43,249
Now, unluckily you are in the Latin side.

311
00:28:44,007 --> 00:28:50,358
So here, Catholic church is prospering.

312
00:28:50,993 --> 00:28:56,444
Now, if you see to the Latin side and
understand

313
00:28:56,645 --> 00:29:00,026
to what extent they have gone to the left
side,

314
00:29:00,227 --> 00:29:05,318
and getting to the left side what diseases
you get, very nicely,

315
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:08,812
make a list of them.

316
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:13,485
So what I said will work out in France:

317
00:29:13,686 --> 00:29:17,504
the left-sided incurable diseases.

318
00:29:17,705 --> 00:29:21,279
As it is, you walk on the street, you find
at least three, four

319
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,711
mad people, lunatic people walking,
you’ll find them.

320
00:29:27,514 --> 00:29:32,259
Very simple it is. You don’t have to go
to the lunatic asylum, on the street!

321
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:38,129
They’ll be all talking and saying things,
but it’s all there.

322
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:41,767
“That’s why they drink, that’s why they
are miserable.”.

323
00:29:41,967 --> 00:29:47,528
I do not know what are the statistics
of the diseases.

324
00:29:51,936 --> 00:29:56,773
So the problem is extremely grave,
very grave.

325
00:29:56,974 --> 00:30:00,291
And you have to work it out,

326
00:30:00,492 --> 00:30:05,407
with the gravity of your Gurupada which
you have asked Me the other day –

327
00:30:05,608 --> 00:30:11,354
you asked for the status of a guru,
for ladies as well as for men.

328
00:30:11,555 --> 00:30:16,110
And I said, “All right, start!”

329
00:30:17,403 --> 00:30:22,670
I hope you all have heard the song
I’ve made, for asking.

330
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:25,301
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Marathi]

331
00:30:25,502 --> 00:30:27,085
All right, once they will sing that song.

332
00:30:27,286 --> 00:30:29,582
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Marathi]
All right.

333
00:30:29,783 --> 00:30:40,195
They will sing that song to you. There are
different requests from the Mother,

334
00:30:40,396 --> 00:30:44,559
and in this the last one is that: “Mother,
now you give us

335
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,920
the Gurupada, the status of a guru.”

336
00:30:49,121 --> 00:30:54,669
But every guru has a duty: to cleanse
the society in which he lives.

337
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:57,930
It’s his duty, he has to fight it.

338
00:30:58,131 --> 00:31:02,682
Christ fought it alone, so many saints
fought it alone,

339
00:31:02,883 --> 00:31:07,980
they were treated very badly, put in jail,
given poisons, things, but they fought it.

340
00:31:08,181 --> 00:31:13,281
In the same way you stand on Truth,
and you have to fight it.

341
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:18,914
Because you are saints.

342
00:31:22,446 --> 00:31:24,812
May God bless you.
