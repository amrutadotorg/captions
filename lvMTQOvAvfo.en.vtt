00:03.629 --> 00:29.310
Sahaja Culture and Ego
New Jersey Ashram, USA

00:29.310 --> 00:40.260
October 26, 1985

00:40.260 --> 01:07.240
Today I was thinking of talking, telling you
about the Sahaja Culture.

01:07.240 --> 01:14.770
Now we are formed in dharma, Vishwa Dharma.

01:14.770 --> 01:17.840
But it must have a culture.

01:17.840 --> 01:25.439
So far in all the religions there is no combination
of religion and culture.

01:25.439 --> 01:27.969
No religion has.

01:27.969 --> 01:31.359
That's why everywhere you find different cultures.

01:31.359 --> 01:37.109
Say in India, people who follow Hindu religion
have different cultures in different places.

01:37.109 --> 01:42.740
They are living in Lucknow, or say in U.P.,
they have a Muslim culture.

01:42.740 --> 01:45.020
More Islamic style.

01:45.020 --> 01:50.310
They'll eat in one plate, do all kinds of
things which normally a South Indian won't

01:50.310 --> 01:55.990
do, and the South Indians have a different
culture from Maharashtrians.

01:55.990 --> 02:02.320
So even in a religion like Hindu religion
where culture is important, very important,

02:02.320 --> 02:04.740
we find varieties.

02:04.740 --> 02:10.729
So the cultures get influenced by the neighboring
cultures or surrounding cultures, and that's

02:10.729 --> 02:15.890
how people get lost.

02:15.890 --> 02:20.940
When you establish a religion like this, Vishwa
Dharma, it's not like any other religion.

02:20.940 --> 02:27.640
It's the real religion within us, and this
reality comes to us because now we are one

02:27.640 --> 02:29.120
with the Spirit.

02:29.120 --> 02:35.420
So when we talk of Sahaja Culture, it is the
culture of the Spirit.

02:35.420 --> 02:36.420
Now what is a culture?

02:36.420 --> 02:38.970
First of all let us see what is a culture
is.

02:38.970 --> 02:44.700
So the culture is the pattern of behavior
we have with others.

02:44.700 --> 02:49.760
Is a common pattern of behavior we are supposed
to have with others.

02:49.760 --> 02:54.100
Like in English language, for example, we'll
say "Thank you".

02:54.100 --> 02:58.460
Even if somebody murders, you may say, "Thank
you".

02:58.460 --> 03:05.480
Or the person who murders you can say, "Sorry".

03:05.480 --> 03:10.360
On the phone one may say, just if they say
something you can't hear, "Sorry?"

03:10.360 --> 03:11.360
Every time, "Sorry".

03:11.360 --> 03:13.631
As if "sorry" is a word so easily to be used.

03:13.631 --> 03:16.330
I mean if you are sorry, why are you sorry
for that?

03:16.330 --> 03:17.330
"Sorry?"

03:17.330 --> 03:21.180
On the phone they used to first say, "I beg
your pardon?", was sensible; but now I find

03:21.180 --> 03:24.400
everybody, A to Z, says, "Sorry?"

03:24.400 --> 03:28.140
I mean, it has no meaning, because what are
you sorry about?

03:28.140 --> 03:29.620
Says "Sorry?"

03:29.620 --> 03:31.231
For everything they are sorry.

03:31.231 --> 03:33.330
Or we can say in English language, when we
speak, "I'm afraid".

03:33.330 --> 03:35.790
You see, it's very common, "I'm afraid".

03:35.790 --> 03:37.930
What are you afraid of?

03:37.930 --> 03:39.530
The whole world is afraid of you.

03:39.530 --> 03:48.610
So this is the culture, what we talk of, any
culture as such, becomes artificial, is not

03:48.610 --> 03:50.790
spontaneous, doesn't come from reality.

03:50.790 --> 03:57.980
It has no meaning; sometimes it is pointless,
absolutely pointless to stick to certain cultures.

03:57.980 --> 04:01.390
So the culture of the Spirit doesn't change.

04:01.390 --> 04:07.510
It's universal, and is higher than any other
culture.

04:07.510 --> 04:10.010
Apart from that it integrates all the essences
of all the cultures.

04:10.010 --> 04:18.810
So
it emanates from the spirit.

04:18.810 --> 04:22.160
Now, spirit has two sides.

04:22.160 --> 04:26.842
One side which you see, the another you don't
see, like the moon.

04:26.842 --> 04:32.790
The side you see is outside with other people,
other Sahaja Yogis, other people, other societies,

04:32.790 --> 04:40.570
which are not yourself, absolutely.

04:40.570 --> 04:48.120
The other side you don't see is the relationship
with God Almighty, relationship with your

04:48.120 --> 04:49.290
Mother.

04:49.290 --> 04:58.870
If the other side is not all right, the behavioral
side outside could become artificial, could

04:58.870 --> 05:02.410
become crooked and not Sahaj.

05:02.410 --> 05:06.680
So it's the other way round than any other
culture.

05:06.680 --> 05:08.430
To know any other culture what do we go?

05:08.430 --> 05:13.970
We see how they talk, what is their language,
how they speak, how they behave: all the outside

05:13.970 --> 05:15.350
things we get.

05:15.350 --> 05:21.590
We must know "thank you" if we want to know
English language, must know "thank you", "please",

05:21.590 --> 05:23.210
all that.

05:23.210 --> 05:29.380
But if you want to know the Sahaja culture,
you have to know your Mother, and you have

05:29.380 --> 05:30.730
to know God Almighty.

05:30.730 --> 05:38.190
And the relationship between your Mother and
the God Almighty has to be absolutely perfect.

05:38.190 --> 05:41.700
Then there's no problem.

05:41.700 --> 05:49.740
But that, the relationship, if it is not all
right, you cannot have artificial Sahaj culture.

05:49.740 --> 05:51.710
That is one thing for sure.

05:51.710 --> 05:56.490
Artificial Sahaj culture is not all right.

05:56.490 --> 06:03.311
I would say that India has, in its basics,
the culture of the spirit, India has; because

06:03.311 --> 06:16.380
for traditions and traditions in India, and
for ages, people have been seeking the truth.

06:16.380 --> 06:23.440
Spiritually they are endowed, because of the
saints.

06:23.440 --> 06:31.610
They are blessed specially because they have
been seekers, not of material things, but

06:31.610 --> 06:33.500
of the spirit.

06:33.500 --> 06:41.430
Specially in Maharashtra, we should say, because
the Kundalini is there always like a magnet.

06:41.430 --> 06:47.130
People are attracted because Shri Ganesha
being the magnet, attracted towards God and

06:47.130 --> 06:48.130
spirit.

06:48.130 --> 06:52.840
So they form a pattern, but there is lot of
artificiality in that also has grown.

06:52.840 --> 07:01.960
We must admit that there is lot, lot of artificiality,
falsehood, nonsense that has grown into it,

07:01.960 --> 07:07.610
because the religion fell into the hands of,
spiritual religion fell into the hands of

07:07.610 --> 07:12.400
gross, horrible so-called Brahmins who were
not realized souls.

07:12.400 --> 07:18.620
So the whole culture has become so nonsensical
sometimes that you don't know where to look.

07:18.620 --> 07:29.580
But to have the culture, first of all, culture
is developed through meditation, by facing

07:29.580 --> 07:32.729
yourself.

07:32.729 --> 07:45.110
First of all you should face yourself, how
you feel about your Mother and about God Almighty.

07:45.110 --> 07:52.020
First of all, how much liberty you take of
your Mother?

07:52.020 --> 07:57.350
How much granted, take for granted your Mother?

07:57.350 --> 08:02.710
She's a Mahamaya.

08:02.710 --> 08:06.720
Even the first "M" is difficult to understand.

08:06.720 --> 08:14.990
So when you start taking liberties, all the
time putting your pressure on Her, all the

08:14.990 --> 08:24.759
time trying to attract Her attention, Her
time, or writing letters eleven pages, all

08:24.759 --> 08:26.660
that, is one side.

08:26.660 --> 08:32.000
Another side is complete indifference to your
Mother.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.539
So it is to be known through your heart.

08:34.539 --> 08:37.290
You don't have to talk to Me.

08:37.290 --> 08:41.930
I know whose heart is pulsating.

08:41.930 --> 08:47.680
Perhaps I'm the only person who knows really
what you are.

08:47.680 --> 08:50.250
You may not be knowing yourself also.

08:50.250 --> 08:59.050
I may not say, but I know you in all details,
out of which I may say little bit, because

08:59.050 --> 09:03.860
I am too gentle to say things.

09:03.860 --> 09:06.260
Because again of Sahaj culture.

09:06.260 --> 09:11.760
Because of Sahaj culture, I cannot say everything
to you on your face.

09:11.760 --> 09:17.390
I'm correcting it, trying to correct it, correct
it; if not possible, then I say to you.

09:17.390 --> 09:21.040
Then in that you have to also see how much
worshipful you are.

09:21.040 --> 09:28.370
Some people, though they spend more time with
Me, remain with Me, want to be with Me, it

09:28.370 --> 09:33.600
is only when they feel surrendered, also.

09:33.600 --> 09:36.881
So it should not be confused: if somebody
is spending more time with Me, you should

09:36.881 --> 09:38.710
not condemn yourself for that.

09:38.710 --> 09:40.000
It's all right.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.580
But how far you are surrendered is the point.

09:43.580 --> 09:48.390
Now, if you are surrendered, how do you see
the surrendering in a person?

09:48.390 --> 09:54.770
You see it has one side and the another is
the expression.

09:54.770 --> 10:04.340
Say a person who is surrendered doesn't talk
much to Me, doesn't talk, he listens, doesn't

10:04.340 --> 10:05.340
talk.

10:05.340 --> 10:10.710
Common sense, he listens.

10:10.710 --> 10:16.890
Even people who are very good, I've seen when
I'm talking, they'll put in their own words

10:16.890 --> 10:19.300
in between.

10:19.300 --> 10:21.779
People who are very good, I should say.

10:21.779 --> 10:24.490
So the surrendering is not full.

10:24.490 --> 10:26.750
Then the time, they become very conscious
of the time.

10:26.750 --> 10:31.600
Who has made the time?

10:31.600 --> 10:35.110
But the person won't come directly and tell
Me, but tell somebody else, "Go and tell Mother,

10:35.110 --> 10:37.490
She has to go at this time."

10:37.490 --> 10:46.220
I know everything, who tells whom, who goes
to whom, who is telling someone, who is time-bound.

10:46.220 --> 10:49.760
And then I flout it.

10:49.760 --> 10:56.220
I know what time to reach, what is the auspicious
time, how it will work out.

10:56.220 --> 10:59.950
Surrendering has to be to that point, that
you shouldn't worry.

10:59.950 --> 11:04.130
I would say Dumahl is one of them who is a
very great surrendered fellow.

11:04.130 --> 11:07.330
When I went there I was very tired, and he
said.

11:07.330 --> 11:09.610
"Mother, if You want to rest You can rest."

11:09.610 --> 11:10.779
I said, "Yes, I want to rest."

11:10.779 --> 11:12.140
So he just left Me alone.

11:12.140 --> 11:17.950
I was really very tired because I had a very
long journey, and then this and that, and

11:17.950 --> 11:21.209
then I went down all the way there.

11:21.209 --> 11:24.530
I thought, "I'll lie down, and sleep off.

11:24.530 --> 11:31.800
" Of course, as I know that everything has
to be done at right time, I just went down.

11:31.800 --> 11:42.200
And we had a program of My reception at one
place in a village, and they were all waiting

11:42.200 --> 11:45.170
for Me there.

11:45.170 --> 11:46.170
And I was sleeping; he wouldn't wake Me up.

11:46.170 --> 11:47.170
He wouldn't wake Me up.

11:47.170 --> 11:50.650
He said, "Everything will be all right.

11:50.650 --> 11:53.800
Tell them when Mother will come."

11:53.800 --> 11:58.420
So there was sun on, they were all sitting
under the tree, sun was scorchingly hot.

11:58.420 --> 12:03.330
They were nicely having a nice nap under the
tree and all that.

12:03.330 --> 12:08.339
All the villagers arrived, everybody arrived,
everything worked out.

12:08.339 --> 12:12.890
And when I got up it was about five-thirty,
then he told Me that, "Mother, I didn't tell

12:12.890 --> 12:13.990
You the program."

12:13.990 --> 12:15.230
He never tells Me.

12:15.230 --> 12:19.160
If I get something written, well and good,
but, "You were sleeping, I didn't want to

12:19.160 --> 12:20.160
disturb You."

12:20.160 --> 12:21.160
"What's the program?"

12:21.160 --> 12:22.160
"It was at three o'clock."

12:22.160 --> 12:23.160
I said, "Three o'clock.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.160
Why didn't you tell Me?

12:24.160 --> 12:26.350
Why didn't you wake Me?"

12:26.350 --> 12:29.530
He said, "You were awake, I knew You were
awake, Mother.

12:29.530 --> 12:30.530
It's all right."

12:30.530 --> 12:38.840
So we started off at six o'clock.

12:38.840 --> 12:39.950
Sun had gone down.

12:39.950 --> 12:46.830
By that time they arranged beautiful lights
and fireworks and everything, and all the

12:46.830 --> 12:50.610
rushing about was finished, they're very well
settled.

12:50.610 --> 12:55.750
And the people from distant villages had also
arrived, and they had organized them so well,

12:55.750 --> 13:00.860
and they had a proper time, and are very happy
that I came late because sun was not there,

13:00.860 --> 13:02.210
so scorchingly hot.

13:02.210 --> 13:09.000
By the time we reached about seven o'clock
it was night and they illumined the lights,

13:09.000 --> 13:15.010
and the diwali like this was put up everywhere,
and they got everything, they had sufficient

13:15.010 --> 13:16.899
time to do everything.

13:16.899 --> 13:25.990
Then Dumahl said, "I knew, Mother, You are
awake, and You were managing."

13:25.990 --> 13:29.980
If one can understand that, then you will
not try to organize Me.

13:29.980 --> 13:33.550
You can just tell Me, "We have to leave at
this time."

13:33.550 --> 13:39.730
But if I don't have to leave, I will not leave
whatever you may do.

13:39.730 --> 13:48.380
In My own sweet way; you will never find Me
obstinate, but I am.

13:48.380 --> 13:51.710
Because I know what is right is what is right,
and has to be done that way.

13:51.710 --> 13:55.350
But otherwise I'm very calm, I am not bothered.

13:55.350 --> 14:01.120
I never organize you, I never hurry you, I
never do anything that should upset you.

14:01.120 --> 14:10.930
Spirit is never upset, never excited, never
hurries, and never is what you call that "go-go"

14:10.930 --> 14:13.050
business.

14:13.050 --> 14:14.880
Like now, we have to go to the airport.

14:14.880 --> 14:19.900
You'll find everybody was like an aeroplane
- round, round, round, round.

14:19.900 --> 14:20.900
What has happened?

14:20.900 --> 14:21.900
"Oh, we had to go?

14:21.900 --> 14:22.900
We'd.."

14:22.900 --> 14:23.900
"We have to go, all right.

14:23.900 --> 14:24.900
So what?"

14:24.900 --> 14:31.079
The whole thing is, all these excitements
and all these things come to us because we

14:31.079 --> 14:32.399
are outside.

14:32.399 --> 14:34.310
But if you are one with your spirit you're
absolutely calm, absolutely calm, "All right,

14:34.310 --> 14:38.910
we have to go, all right, we'll reach there.

14:38.910 --> 14:40.320
Doesn't matter."

14:40.320 --> 14:45.680
The other day we had to go for some shopping,
I was trying to buy some saris for Indian

14:45.680 --> 14:46.680
ladies.

14:46.680 --> 14:47.890
We got lost.

14:47.890 --> 14:49.380
I never bothered them at all.

14:49.380 --> 14:52.240
They were going round and round, and round
and round.

14:52.240 --> 14:56.300
And then Danny realized and said, "I think
perhaps we had to leave vibrations in all

14:56.300 --> 14:57.300
these places."

14:57.300 --> 14:58.820
I said, "Correct."

14:58.820 --> 15:01.770
And for about two hours I think, we were roaming
about.

15:01.770 --> 15:03.769
Anybody else would be saying, "What's this?

15:03.769 --> 15:06.620
You can't find the place, what's the matter
with you?”

15:06.620 --> 15:07.620
Calm.

15:07.620 --> 15:12.839
We reached the shop at the right time, got
everything at the right time, did everything,

15:12.839 --> 15:14.130
came back at right time.

15:14.130 --> 15:17.370
Everything was first class, nothing went wrong.

15:17.370 --> 15:21.870
But anybody in My place, I tell you, that
time would have been, "Oh God, this, that."

15:21.870 --> 15:22.870
Why are you saving time?

15:22.870 --> 15:27.880
For what are you saving time?

15:27.880 --> 15:31.920
So we miss the present, and that's one thing
spirit never misses.

15:31.920 --> 15:34.870
It's always in the present.

15:34.870 --> 15:38.630
That's the reality.

15:38.630 --> 15:44.880
Now in the West people are very futuristic,
extremely futuristic, and their futuristicness

15:44.880 --> 15:50.780
sometimes takes them to points, say for example
if they have to go by train.

15:50.780 --> 15:54.100
So instead of arriving at the right station,
they'll go to the station which is further

15:54.100 --> 15:56.100
on.

15:56.100 --> 15:57.790
And then again they'll arrive at the further
on.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.320
The train will never reach them.

16:00.320 --> 16:03.940
Sort of temperament they have.

16:03.940 --> 16:10.620
So one should not plan at all anything like
that, that fixes you.

16:10.620 --> 16:15.570
But at this moment, if I have to be told that
we have to go at this time, is all right,

16:15.570 --> 16:16.570
finished now.

16:16.570 --> 16:18.720
At this moment I've told, is recorded, finished.

16:18.720 --> 16:19.720
All right?

16:19.720 --> 16:22.160
So it's gone into the memory.

16:22.160 --> 16:23.830
There's nothing to worry about it now.

16:23.830 --> 16:26.310
Now, present moment, what are we doing?

16:26.310 --> 16:30.160
In a very calm way, witness it.

16:30.160 --> 16:32.910
Witness yourself, now, witness yourself.

16:32.910 --> 16:36.450
"Where is my mind going?"

16:36.450 --> 16:41.920
Now somebody who has to cook must be thinking,
"Oh, I have to get this, I have to get that."

16:41.920 --> 16:46.950
Once you start saying that "I have to do it",
you'll never be able to do it that way.

16:46.950 --> 16:53.660
But you said, "All right, just now I'm in
meditation."

16:53.660 --> 16:57.260
Every moment, "I am in meditation."

16:57.260 --> 17:03.680
Everything will walk up to you, even matter,
and you'll get the right things at the right

17:03.680 --> 17:06.250
place.

17:06.250 --> 17:10.809
You'll meet right people at the right place.

17:10.809 --> 17:14.220
The other day we were just walking, strolling
around.

17:14.220 --> 17:16.220
Whom do we find there?

17:16.220 --> 17:17.220
Carolyn.

17:17.220 --> 17:19.010
She just walked out.

17:19.010 --> 17:23.470
There is she, I mean I met her.

17:23.470 --> 17:25.370
She said, "Christine is just next door."

17:25.370 --> 17:29.580
I said, "Let's go," and you should have seen
the joy on her face when she came down, and

17:29.580 --> 17:31.250
she saw Me.

17:31.250 --> 17:35.770
Beautiful experience for Me and her, she was
so happy.

17:35.770 --> 17:38.530
Then we went together.

17:38.530 --> 17:45.530
So when you have so much tied down with your
watch, that means you are not tied down with

17:45.530 --> 17:47.900
your spirit.

17:47.900 --> 17:55.779
So a Sahaja yogi, if he sees watch, then he's
not a Sahaja yogi.

17:55.779 --> 18:00.950
But the other side could be that the Sahaja
yogis are never in time where they have to

18:00.950 --> 18:02.570
be.

18:02.570 --> 18:04.970
Very common in England.

18:04.970 --> 18:08.880
I reach always first, to open the door.

18:08.880 --> 18:16.060
And to clean it also sometimes.

18:16.060 --> 18:24.059
Now, to take for granted things, as you say,
take for granted, that's not the way Sahaja

18:24.059 --> 18:25.059
Yoga is.

18:25.059 --> 18:27.929
You have to be alert, alert, absolutely alert.

18:27.929 --> 18:31.880
If you are alert, immediately you'll know
"I have to go now at this time.

18:31.880 --> 18:34.140
I have to do it.

18:34.140 --> 18:38.010
I have to get this thing now."

18:38.010 --> 18:41.770
If you have to miss something, you are supposed
to miss it.

18:41.770 --> 18:43.320
That's what it is.

18:43.320 --> 18:48.559
So, there's a beautiful thing written down,
like they say, "Jai sei rakhahu tase hi rahun"

18:48.559 --> 18:53.960
- "The way You keep me, the way I am, will
be happy."

18:53.960 --> 18:58.559
So, satisfaction towards yourself, your spirit,
is important.

18:58.559 --> 19:06.600
Because ego will plan out, "Oh, we'll go there,
we must get for Mother, say, daisies", we

19:06.600 --> 19:07.600
decide.

19:07.600 --> 19:08.600
"Must get daisies."

19:08.600 --> 19:09.800
You don't find daisies, you're disappointed.

19:09.800 --> 19:10.800
Why not?

19:10.800 --> 19:15.020
These are all My flowers, whether they are
daisies or not, they look so nice.

19:15.020 --> 19:18.570
Whatever you get, you get it.

19:18.570 --> 19:20.470
That's the thing wanted.

19:20.470 --> 19:26.720
You know that, that the Divine is working
out everything for you.

19:26.720 --> 19:31.370
When you are supposed to get something else,
better have it.

19:31.370 --> 19:39.080
Even by mistake, if I lay My hand upon some
things, like a book or something, immediately

19:39.080 --> 19:43.390
I'll open it out and see why this book has
come in My attention; why this fellow has

19:43.390 --> 19:47.669
come in My attention; why this is happening.

19:47.669 --> 19:53.651
And immediately I find that there’s some
connection, something has to be done, something

19:53.651 --> 19:57.140
has to be said, something has to be worked
out.

19:57.140 --> 20:08.520
So for a person who is imbibed with the culture
of spirit, the Sahaj culture, impresses others

20:08.520 --> 20:12.600
by his calmness and relaxed attitude.

20:12.600 --> 20:16.870
Relaxation never means lethargy, by any chance.

20:16.870 --> 20:18.929
It doesn't mean lethargy.

20:18.929 --> 20:21.880
Lethargy is against relaxation.

20:21.880 --> 20:24.950
A person who is relaxed cannot become lethargic.

20:24.950 --> 20:30.460
"Relaxed" means a person who’s alert and
calm.

20:30.460 --> 20:42.580
These two things for human beings is an impossibility,
because if they are alert, if they are alert

20:42.580 --> 20:44.830
then they're not calm.

20:44.830 --> 20:51.000
If they're unhappy, sad, then they think they
are very, very calm.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.780
So this is one of the things one has to remember,
that you have to witness yourself all the

20:55.780 --> 20:57.690
time.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.760
Not to condemn yourself, but witness.

20:59.760 --> 21:03.299
Now I said the word "witness" means "detached".

21:03.299 --> 21:08.781
Now what happens with this, when you start
condemning yourself, you miss every good point.

21:08.781 --> 21:20.270
For example, you have some experience of a
sudden height being achieved.

21:20.270 --> 21:21.679
All right?

21:21.679 --> 21:28.590
At that point you should catch hold of it,
hold on to it, keep doing, but don't forget

21:28.590 --> 21:32.369
that you may go back, no.

21:32.369 --> 21:36.460
And then wait for another higher moment to
come, hold on to it.

21:36.460 --> 21:39.169
That's how you climb Himalayas.

21:39.169 --> 21:41.500
But not that, "Oh Ma.

21:41.500 --> 21:44.970
Now it's all right, but what will happen next?"

21:44.970 --> 21:52.260
Then you are gone down, because you have to
face yourself in the way, knowing what are

21:52.260 --> 21:53.260
your powers.

21:53.260 --> 21:57.900
You are a spirit now, you are no more an ordinary
human being, so you have no business to condemn

21:57.900 --> 22:04.059
yourself, or to degrade yourself, or in any
way to feel unhappy.

22:04.059 --> 22:05.070
No way.

22:05.070 --> 22:06.600
Past is past.

22:06.600 --> 22:09.140
What happened a moment before is finished.

22:09.140 --> 22:10.140
"Now I am going to rise.

22:10.140 --> 22:15.520
Now I am going to rise."

22:15.520 --> 22:27.850
So a person who has a Sahaja culture is not
only spontaneous, but is inspired, is a inspired

22:27.850 --> 22:29.840
personality.

22:29.840 --> 22:40.480
A person who is of that kind, an inspired
visionary, then other people get impressed

22:40.480 --> 22:47.570
by such a person that, "See, there's a man
who's inspired, who talks in an inspired way,

22:47.570 --> 22:52.080
in a way that is something very different
from others."

22:52.080 --> 22:58.120
Something new he says, new that is nourishing.

22:58.120 --> 23:05.200
Such a personality - like the other day, you
see, we heard the lectures of so many people,

23:05.200 --> 23:11.669
and when the New Zealand Prime Minister was
coming C.P. said, "Now let's go back, because

23:11.669 --> 23:13.090
we'll have a little tea or something."

23:13.090 --> 23:14.919
I said: "No, you listen to this man.

23:14.919 --> 23:15.919
He's a realized soul."

23:15.919 --> 23:16.919
He said, "Really?"

23:16.919 --> 23:18.230
I said, "Yes, you listen to him."

23:18.230 --> 23:22.190
First everybody was, "He's sitting in New
Zealand, such a little titwit of a country,

23:22.190 --> 23:24.110
what is he going to speak?"

23:24.110 --> 23:26.080
You see, they were moving about, making a…

23:26.080 --> 23:30.870
Within two minutes he captured everybody's
attention, you see, and he was bubbling with

23:30.870 --> 23:37.559
everything, so beautifully, and he spoke all
the points so much different, and so much

23:37.559 --> 23:39.070
new and so much better.

23:39.070 --> 23:40.070
C.P.

23:40.070 --> 23:41.070
was amazed.

23:41.070 --> 23:42.070
He said, "How do You know?"

23:42.070 --> 23:47.030
I said, "I know, because when I was in New
Zealand I told them he's a realized soul."

23:47.030 --> 23:51.169
And our own Prime Minister is also a realized
soul.

23:51.169 --> 23:54.740
You'll be surprised, after our Prime Minister
finished his lecture and all that, after two

23:54.740 --> 24:00.659
or three lectures he was to go; then he turned
round and went to this Australian [Shri Mataji

24:00.659 --> 24:05.520
may have meant New Zealand] Prime Minister,
only him, went and congratulated him, congratulated

24:05.520 --> 24:06.520
him.

24:06.520 --> 24:09.330
Congratulated and said something very close
to him.

24:09.330 --> 24:13.020
And the fellow again, you see, flew up into
joy.

24:13.020 --> 24:14.799
We see it's all there.

24:14.799 --> 24:16.700
And then he came away.

24:16.700 --> 24:17.700
Why?

24:17.700 --> 24:22.810
Because one realized soul understands another
realized soul, and everybody was amazed: why

24:22.810 --> 24:26.950
did he turn to this man alone, and went and
congratulated him?

24:26.950 --> 24:34.080
So such a large country like India represented
by our Prime Minister, goes down all the way

24:34.080 --> 24:39.770
to a little country like New Zealand which
is nothing compared to India, and congratulates.

24:39.770 --> 24:42.500
And that's a developed country, this is a
developing country.

24:42.500 --> 24:45.050
Is something people did not understand.

24:45.050 --> 24:48.700
And the whole joyous atmosphere both of them
shaking hands created.

24:48.700 --> 24:58.280
This is Sahaja culture, in which you recognize
a realized soul, the dignity of a realized

24:58.280 --> 24:59.550
soul.

24:59.550 --> 25:05.770
So when it comes to relating to others, first
and foremost are Sahaja yogis.

25:05.770 --> 25:13.169
But I've seen most of the people are more
congenial with others, and less congenial

25:13.169 --> 25:15.980
with Sahaja yogis.

25:15.980 --> 25:22.330
They try to criticize Sahaja yogis all the
time, and I test them.

25:22.330 --> 25:23.700
I sometimes say, "All right.

25:23.700 --> 25:27.030
I don't think this fellow is very good" and
all that.

25:27.030 --> 25:31.370
But when the other person turns round and
shows compassion and says, "No, Mother, I

25:31.370 --> 25:35.789
think it will work out" then I like it.

25:35.789 --> 25:37.500
I like that.

25:37.500 --> 25:40.840
Or else sometimes I say, "Oh, let them go
away.

25:40.840 --> 25:44.140
There should be no more food for them, it's
all right."

25:44.140 --> 25:47.820
No, Mother, we've made food for them."

25:47.820 --> 25:52.190
So the culture of Sahaj is to give.

25:52.190 --> 25:58.480
Give, and give, and give, and never ask for
a reward.

25:58.480 --> 26:00.929
Never thinks, "What I have to get".

26:00.929 --> 26:07.610
After all, you have got the highest that anybody
could get.

26:07.610 --> 26:13.170
They said the three heights a human being
can achieve in spirituality, which you all

26:13.170 --> 26:15.440
got in no time.

26:15.440 --> 26:22.669
It's called as salokya, samipya, sanidya.

26:22.669 --> 26:27.950
Salokya is that you should be able to see
God.

26:27.950 --> 26:31.600
That you got.

26:31.600 --> 26:38.780
Samipya is the closeness with God.

26:38.780 --> 26:43.860
Sanidya is the togetherness, togetherness.

26:43.860 --> 26:52.030
You have got all these three.

26:52.030 --> 26:55.539
In one incarnation you've got it.

26:55.539 --> 27:08.800
When Gods incarnated before, nobody knew that
they were Gods.

27:08.800 --> 27:12.520
So even they got it, they never knew.

27:12.520 --> 27:18.270
Very few people knew about them.

27:18.270 --> 27:27.600
But even when Christ said He was the Son of
God, who, how many believed Him?

27:27.600 --> 27:30.030
They crucified Him.

27:30.030 --> 27:33.330
Because they were not realized souls.

27:33.330 --> 27:38.980
But by giving you realization I have given
you that capacity to get all these three blessings

27:38.980 --> 27:40.980
at one shot.

27:40.980 --> 27:45.940
I speak your language, I speak your style,
I live with your style, and you understand

27:45.940 --> 27:46.940
Me.

27:46.940 --> 27:48.150
There is no problem.

27:48.150 --> 27:53.710
But with other Gods, imagine if I were Mahakali
today, what would have happened.

27:53.710 --> 28:00.870
You would be all upside-down there hanging,
seeing Me from the other way round.

28:00.870 --> 28:05.350
I don't know what would have happened - or
any one of them.

28:05.350 --> 28:16.059
So the three blessings that a saint is promised,
you've got all of them.

28:16.059 --> 28:22.560
But because you've got them, you don't understand.

28:22.560 --> 28:24.039
You take it for granted.

28:24.039 --> 28:27.049
There's no shraddha.

28:27.049 --> 28:35.760
With this experience there should be tremendous
faith.

28:35.760 --> 28:43.669
Faith is a thing that resides between Me and
you, in between.

28:43.669 --> 28:47.790
Is we can say, the ocean of joy that is in
between.

28:47.790 --> 29:00.049
Whatever I emit to you is that shraddha, and
when you are drenched into it, the joy of

29:00.049 --> 29:08.940
that shraddha makes everything so sahaj.

29:08.940 --> 29:15.970
But for that you must open your hearts.

29:15.970 --> 29:25.690
A Sahaja yogi who is secretive, who is insular,
who is jealous, who separates himself from

29:25.690 --> 29:28.669
others is no good.

29:28.669 --> 29:31.720
Open your heart.

29:31.720 --> 29:37.820
Give away your things, doesn't matter.

29:37.820 --> 29:44.289
Matter has only one value, that it can communicate
your Sahaj culture.

29:44.289 --> 29:59.370
Little things, you see, I see something that
you have got beautiful, and in My Mahamaya

29:59.370 --> 30:03.730
acting on Myself I say, "Oh, that's very beautiful."

30:03.730 --> 30:12.770
and then they say, "Mother, You gave us this."

30:12.770 --> 30:15.640
"Ah, sorry."

30:15.640 --> 30:21.020
And then I feel very ashamed of Myself, that
this is not Sahaj culture, you see.

30:21.020 --> 30:24.820
But the joy is so much that I can't help it
sometimes I say, "Oh, I - it's so beautiful,

30:24.820 --> 30:26.080
this one."

30:26.080 --> 30:30.220
"You gave us, Mother."

30:30.220 --> 30:35.260
And the whole rapport and the whole feeling;
I feeling a little shy about it, and all,

30:35.260 --> 30:42.590
they're so beautiful, so dramatic; so dramatic
it is, so poetic.

30:42.590 --> 30:45.870
Only at that point I feel ashamed of Myself.

30:45.870 --> 30:52.440
Of course to be human being you should be
ashamed of yourself sometimes.

30:52.440 --> 30:53.830
Otherwise the drama is not complete.

30:53.830 --> 31:00.490
So the whole thing is so beautiful and so
joyous.

31:00.490 --> 31:05.600
But that gentleness towards others and yourself
should be there.

31:05.600 --> 31:11.820
Now if you become unhappy and serious, you
are very unkind to yourself and to others.

31:11.820 --> 31:17.710
Anybody who is a serious person, sits with
a serious face, know that he is not a Sahaja

31:17.710 --> 31:19.270
yogi at all.

31:19.270 --> 31:22.659
They should be bubbling with laughter, joy
all the time.

31:22.659 --> 31:27.820
I cannot be serious for more than, I think,
five seconds perhaps.

31:27.820 --> 31:30.230
I don't know.

31:30.230 --> 31:34.630
I try, because lectures should be serious
to go into the hearts of the people.

31:34.630 --> 31:41.500
But there's not, and you can see that even
when I'm getting angry, My eyes betray Me,

31:41.500 --> 31:47.160
and there's a twinkle of laughter in the eyes.

31:47.160 --> 31:52.580
That's how a person should be, and don't worry
what others have to say.

31:52.580 --> 31:58.929
You see, the culture where people are just
glum like this, is the same as the people

31:58.929 --> 32:00.350
where they are frivolous.

32:00.350 --> 32:08.929
Now as we can say American culture is to be
frivolous, stupid, you see, I won't be surprised

32:08.929 --> 32:11.170
supposing your Prime Minister tomorrow starts
wearing a sari, just to amuse you.

32:11.170 --> 32:20.809
Anything is possible with them, just to amuse
you, you see, too - for cheap popularity.

32:20.809 --> 32:22.950
Anything frivolous, stupid, they will do.

32:22.950 --> 32:30.490
But supposing, you see, it is say an English
old conservative personality, then a lady

32:30.490 --> 32:39.370
might wear a very official dress with the
lines and this and that, and like a man she

32:39.370 --> 32:45.020
might become very soon, like that, develop
a very serious face.

32:45.020 --> 32:48.830
But both things are nonsensical, has no meaning.

32:48.830 --> 32:56.380
You have to be natural, and natural everything
is always bubbling with joy.

32:56.380 --> 32:58.110
And a message.

32:58.110 --> 32:59.110
And a message.

32:59.110 --> 33:06.970
These flowers are the message of My coming,
writ large on them.

33:06.970 --> 33:14.200
So a person who is a Sahaj culture man should
emit that message to others, people should

33:14.200 --> 33:16.039
see, "Oh, this is the man.

33:16.039 --> 33:18.570
He is the sahaja fellow."

33:18.570 --> 33:19.570
You can see that clearly.

33:19.570 --> 33:21.120
There's no seriousness, there's no unhappiness,
nothing.

33:21.120 --> 33:27.200
Supposing I have said something that might
be upsetting you, forget it.

33:27.200 --> 33:33.580
If you cannot forget that, then you have not
listened to Me.

33:33.580 --> 33:36.510
But "forget" doesn't mean that you do not
act upon it.

33:36.510 --> 33:42.419
"Acting upon it" means that you face yourself
and see for yourself how you have ascended

33:42.419 --> 33:45.620
and how far you have to go, not how you'll
fall down.

33:45.620 --> 33:51.380
So it is all the time acting on both sides,
as I'm telling you in My lecture, that on

33:51.380 --> 33:57.690
one side you'll see to yourself as relationship
with Me, and relationship with others.

33:57.690 --> 34:11.310
For a Sahaja yogi it should not matter whether
you are in a palace or on the street.

34:11.310 --> 34:15.299
The first encounter with the first Sahaja
yogis - we have only one surviving, now here

34:15.299 --> 34:22.809
sitting down - they couldn't bear, for them
it was difficult to be in the beautiful atmosphere

34:22.809 --> 34:23.809
of India.

34:23.809 --> 34:29.760
The reason is, they were analyzing: they have
no good bathrooms, no showers.

34:29.760 --> 34:33.159
But you have the whole sky.

34:33.159 --> 34:35.799
You have all the mountains.

34:35.799 --> 34:37.119
You have all the trees.

34:37.119 --> 34:40.129
You have got all the waters flowing.

34:40.129 --> 34:46.879
But you want to have a little shower, in which
you can't even move.

34:46.879 --> 34:53.559
Just an idea, just an idea of comfort.

34:53.559 --> 34:59.480
You have no comforts, if you ask Me, compared
to what we have in India.

34:59.480 --> 35:01.109
No comforts at all.

35:01.109 --> 35:07.229
I mean, ask any Indian girl to come and stay,
she will cry.

35:07.229 --> 35:13.219
Even I think here the President, the President
has to wash his utensils perhaps, maybe.

35:13.219 --> 35:15.380
What a comfort.

35:15.380 --> 35:18.999
There's no division of labor.

35:18.999 --> 35:23.700
Now in our country we have servants, but "servants"
doesn't mean that we cheat them anything else.

35:23.700 --> 35:26.319
They eat the same food as we eat.

35:26.319 --> 35:28.200
They live the same way we live.

35:28.200 --> 35:32.180
But they do different type of work, because
they don't have the same mental capacity to

35:32.180 --> 35:34.440
be the President.

35:34.440 --> 35:39.069
The President does some other work.

35:39.069 --> 35:42.440
You have no comfort of any kind, you take
it from Me.

35:42.440 --> 35:45.490
Food matter, you get everything processed
food.

35:45.490 --> 35:50.489
Imagine, any time you might be developing
cancer due to processed food.

35:50.489 --> 35:53.099
What is your speciality then?

35:53.099 --> 35:54.839
Try to understand.

35:54.839 --> 36:00.000
What is the kind of food: it's not fresh,
God knows how it is processed, how it is preserved,

36:00.000 --> 36:01.089
from where it is coming.

36:01.089 --> 36:07.180
Suddenly in London they said that, "Don't
eat this kind of food," you see, "because

36:07.180 --> 36:09.529
it has got something contaminated."

36:09.529 --> 36:13.920
So everybody rushes, you see, to the store
room, because we have to store up all these

36:13.920 --> 36:14.920
things.

36:14.920 --> 36:15.920
You can't get at the right….

36:15.920 --> 36:19.440
"Oh it's there"; then you start throwing them
out.

36:19.440 --> 36:29.480
It's a mad racing because people think that,
"God knows what we are eating today, is it

36:29.480 --> 36:30.670
correct or not?"

36:30.670 --> 36:34.509
So food-wise you are zero.

36:34.509 --> 36:41.490
Best thing is to live in the villages or in
the forests, to get the fresh fruits, wash

36:41.490 --> 36:51.529
them in clean flowing water of a river, eat
it nicely and sit down enjoying the sun.

36:51.529 --> 36:58.420
The comfort of the spirit is the thing we
have lost, and those who seek the comfort

36:58.420 --> 37:04.349
of the spirit are Sahaja yogis, not otherwise.

37:04.349 --> 37:08.249
Comfort of the spirit comes in giving.

37:08.249 --> 37:15.529
Say I've borrowed some money from you, I won't
be comfortable till I've paid you back.

37:15.529 --> 37:22.059
Going further with it, supposing you are caught
up into something, you have got some problems.

37:22.059 --> 37:26.730
I'll somehow or other manage that you'll come
close to Me somewhere, and work it out on

37:26.730 --> 37:28.440
you, clear you out, finished.

37:28.440 --> 37:33.499
Till then I won't be comfortable; though I'll
suffer, I'll have pains, I'll have this, that.

37:33.499 --> 37:37.299
As soon as I came here, left Nabhi was like
this going on.

37:37.299 --> 37:38.299
Corrected it.

37:38.299 --> 37:41.640
I took it upon Myself, I sucked it into Me.

37:41.640 --> 37:44.930
So they are adventurous.

37:44.930 --> 37:50.329
"Oh I will not touch, I am catching, he's
catching."

37:50.329 --> 37:51.329
Finished.

37:51.329 --> 37:55.920
But now the compassion can only work out if
you have that kind of a spirit, otherwise

37:55.920 --> 37:57.069
you cannot.

37:57.069 --> 37:58.789
It becomes sympathy.

37:58.789 --> 38:04.410
For example there's one person, Mr. A. or
Miss A. or Mrs. A., whatever it is.

38:04.410 --> 38:09.839
I mean, I'm just talking of a common personality,
and that person is catching.

38:09.839 --> 38:13.800
I would say in an ashram, that person should
clear out.

38:13.800 --> 38:19.099
But all the ashramites will catch from that
person, and that person will never be all

38:19.099 --> 38:20.369
right.

38:20.369 --> 38:23.210
There's a very nice joke about it.

38:23.210 --> 38:26.690
There was a lady, she wanted to reduce herself.

38:26.690 --> 38:29.029
So there was a machine like a rolling-pin.

38:29.029 --> 38:33.099
They said, "If you rub it, then you will reduce."

38:33.099 --> 38:37.849
So she brought, poor thing, she brought the
machine and she started rolling it.

38:37.849 --> 38:48.709
She found that the rolling-pin became fat,
instead of she reducing.

38:48.709 --> 38:53.059
Same thing is in Sahaja yoga.

38:53.059 --> 38:56.319
Instead of Sahaja yogis correcting the others,
they get contaminated.

38:56.319 --> 38:58.160
That's why I said, "Don't have anybody in
the ashram."

38:58.160 --> 39:01.849
Because you sympathize.

39:01.849 --> 39:07.029
You do not try to correct that person, in
a way that you can correct within yourselves,

39:07.029 --> 39:09.489
suck it within yourself as your Mother does,
and do it.

39:09.489 --> 39:14.660
I do it for thousands and thousands and thousands;
you have to do it for one or two, so you are

39:14.660 --> 39:15.660
never bothered.

39:15.660 --> 39:17.269
And that's how you become strong.

39:17.269 --> 39:21.709
Not by shunning them, running away from them
or condemning yourself, or saying that: "We

39:21.709 --> 39:26.029
must save ourselves on the boat."

39:26.029 --> 39:27.029
No.

39:27.029 --> 39:28.490
Through adventure.

39:28.490 --> 39:30.380
"Let's see what happens".

39:30.380 --> 39:33.229
Tamara was telling Me, "Nothing catches me,
Mother, what is it?"

39:33.229 --> 39:35.859
I said: "But who will catch you?

39:35.859 --> 39:41.549
Those who will catch will be hurt themselves."

39:41.549 --> 39:45.030
So what is it, that Bhairava is to be established.

39:45.030 --> 39:51.750
Sidha kala mane Bhairav' - as you have to
establish Shri Ganesha, you have to establish

39:51.750 --> 39:54.509
also Bhairava, and Hanumana on the right side.

39:54.509 --> 40:00.440
If these three deities you establish within
yourself, nothing, nothing on this earth can

40:00.440 --> 40:01.440
catch you.

40:01.440 --> 40:05.000
You'll catch it for a while.

40:05.000 --> 40:08.709
But what I find now, I came to this ashram,
everybody's left Nabhi caught up.

40:08.709 --> 40:13.249
Everybody's left Agnya caught up.

40:13.249 --> 40:14.789
So then I get the pain.

40:14.789 --> 40:15.789
Everyone.

40:15.789 --> 40:18.650
I mean, I have put you inside My body, do
you know that?

40:18.650 --> 40:24.359
You are part and parcel of My body, you are
the cells in My body.

40:24.359 --> 40:33.239
And when you catch, I also catch; not catch,
but I really get the pain, but I clear it.

40:33.239 --> 40:36.170
In the same way, I have given you powers.

40:36.170 --> 40:43.690
Every power I have, I have given you.

40:43.690 --> 40:51.089
But you have to develop it and you have to
be adventurous.

40:51.089 --> 40:56.449
But on the contrary, once we have ashrams,
everybody settles down, "Oh, now, very comfortable,

40:56.449 --> 40:57.449
very cheap."

40:57.449 --> 41:00.630
Very economical, that's the first comfort.

41:00.630 --> 41:11.140
It's surprising, for a Western person, it
is very important that it should be economical,

41:11.140 --> 41:19.509
surprising, affluent people think more of
saving money than the people who are poor.

41:19.509 --> 41:28.759
And English are the last word, save pounds,
at the cost of others.

41:28.759 --> 41:32.440
On the contrary if you go to India, where
they’ll be very happy, they'll invite you

41:32.440 --> 41:33.680
in their house.

41:33.680 --> 41:37.279
Whatever they have they will give it to you,
"Eat, eat, eat."

41:37.279 --> 41:38.279
They'll force you.

41:38.279 --> 41:40.029
They'll be very happy to give.

41:40.029 --> 41:43.630
But in England it's very dangerous, you see.

41:43.630 --> 41:47.049
Sometimes in the ashram they may not even
have food for Me.

41:47.049 --> 41:48.739
Really.

41:48.739 --> 41:51.479
And if you tell them, "I know.

41:51.479 --> 41:52.479
I know."

41:52.479 --> 41:53.479
You know.

41:53.479 --> 41:54.479
Finished.

41:54.479 --> 41:55.479
Then what do you say?

41:55.479 --> 41:57.029
They already know it, now what to do?

41:57.029 --> 41:58.160
They know.

41:58.160 --> 42:06.329
So with the affluence miserliness grows, and
money-orientation.

42:06.329 --> 42:11.749
In India also I've seen people who get little
more money than the rest become very money-oriented.

42:11.749 --> 42:16.619
Money becomes everything, money becomes the
power, money becomes their life.

42:16.619 --> 42:20.420
Sahaja yogi doesn't care for money.

42:20.420 --> 42:25.509
Just.. is the dust of our Mother's feet.

42:25.509 --> 42:28.470
What is money, what is wealth?

42:28.470 --> 42:33.750
And when they do like that, then their money
problems are solved.

42:33.750 --> 42:36.699
If you have a money problem, know that there's
a problem.

42:36.699 --> 42:42.729
If you are very particular about money.

42:42.729 --> 42:47.349
I am, in a way, because if I have to give
somebody, I remember it.

42:47.349 --> 42:51.329
But I've seen people who are very anxious
to tell Me that, "You have to pay this man

42:51.329 --> 42:52.329
so much, that man so much."

42:52.329 --> 42:53.329
That's wrong.

42:53.329 --> 42:55.670
That's not your look-out.

42:55.670 --> 43:00.869
That's very, very wrong to tell Me that, "You
have to pay this man or that man."

43:00.869 --> 43:02.730
It's not important.

43:02.730 --> 43:06.479
Even if I don't pay, I pay him.

43:06.479 --> 43:12.400
So in relationship with Me, you are not to
tell Me that, "You have to pay so much money

43:12.400 --> 43:16.460
to him, this much money should be paid, this
is what he owes You."

43:16.460 --> 43:17.539
Nothing of the kind.

43:17.539 --> 43:20.059
Let the person come and tell Me.

43:20.059 --> 43:21.410
Why are you telling?

43:21.410 --> 43:26.069
That kind of a message if you give Me, you
are lost.

43:26.069 --> 43:31.460
Or if you come and tell Me for somebody else
that, "Mother, time is up, we have to go.

43:31.460 --> 43:33.709
Somebody is hurrying You up."

43:33.709 --> 43:40.069
If somebody is hurrying Me, tell him, "Don't
hurry Mother."

43:40.069 --> 43:52.099
You must know that your kundalinis were not
raised with just your own kundalini, but something

43:52.099 --> 43:53.869
that is working it out.

43:53.869 --> 43:58.730
Something very tremendous, a big organization.

43:58.730 --> 44:02.619
You can't see it, it is microscopic.

44:02.619 --> 44:06.799
You must know, nobody got realization like
that, did they?

44:06.799 --> 44:08.999
Thousands getting realization, what's happening?

44:08.999 --> 44:11.369
There must be something about…

44:11.369 --> 44:16.589
Now how can you tell anything to such an organization?

44:16.589 --> 44:17.589
They don't like it.

44:17.589 --> 44:19.009
They know it.

44:19.009 --> 44:23.020
Actually they are the ones who know, not the
English.

44:23.020 --> 44:26.019
They know what is to be done.

44:26.019 --> 44:32.849
So your relationship with Me acts as your
culture.

44:32.849 --> 44:39.299
So it is a Mother's cult, you can call it,
the Mother's culture.

44:39.299 --> 44:41.961
How we are connected with our Mother.

44:41.961 --> 44:48.759
I have seen people, if somebody is rude to
them, they get very angry.

44:48.759 --> 44:52.170
But if somebody is rude to Me they don't feel
angry.

44:52.170 --> 44:56.220
It should be the other way round.

44:56.220 --> 44:59.380
Now I'll give you an example.

44:59.380 --> 45:05.779
This Merv Griffin was funny, and both our
PRO’s were very angry.

45:05.779 --> 45:07.479
It was natural and very…

45:07.479 --> 45:10.619
I mean, I liked it, but I calmed them down.

45:10.619 --> 45:12.769
And Worlikar of course was on top of this
thing.

45:12.769 --> 45:15.740
But the other fellow would not.

45:15.740 --> 45:19.009
He was giving arguments.

45:19.009 --> 45:20.539
I was just watching.

45:20.539 --> 45:24.170
I mean, if somebody had said this to his mother...

45:24.170 --> 45:32.220
There's another one there, he never came to
receive Me at the airport.

45:32.220 --> 45:42.599
So Worlikar said, "If your own mother had
come, you would not have gone?"

45:42.599 --> 45:46.519
Then one can give explanation, "Oh, but our
Mother is Adi Shakti.

45:46.519 --> 45:48.739
My mother is not, she's helpless."

45:48.739 --> 45:49.739
It's not.

45:49.739 --> 45:54.880
To show your respect, to show your love, you
have to go; for your own gain, not for Her

45:54.880 --> 45:55.880
gain.

45:55.880 --> 45:59.549
For your own gain.

45:59.549 --> 46:03.190
This relationship is for your own gain.

46:03.190 --> 46:12.809
Supposing if you strike oil, is it for your
gain or for the gain of the oil?

46:12.809 --> 46:19.369
If you get to the Source, is it for the Source
to gain anything, or it is for you to gain

46:19.369 --> 46:20.369
anything?

46:20.369 --> 46:23.150
Logic, simple logic.

46:23.150 --> 46:32.309
So in that culture, you see, you really thrive
and you become extremely a happy person, a

46:32.309 --> 46:34.829
joyous person.

46:34.829 --> 46:44.170
And the expression of such a person is so
different, because such a person, as I told

46:44.170 --> 46:50.949
you, rises above and sees the problems of
others, the decadence of the society, sees

46:50.949 --> 46:56.259
all the problems of the world.

46:56.259 --> 47:00.000
Not only that, but knows the solutions.

47:00.000 --> 47:09.809
We are not like these ordinary people who
have racialism, this.. other diseases, I don't

47:09.809 --> 47:12.760
know what sort of diseases they have, I also
forget.

47:12.760 --> 47:15.490
Racialism now, it's another stupid nonsense,
you know.

47:15.490 --> 47:17.029
What is racialism?

47:17.029 --> 47:22.599
God has made somebody's color like this and
somebody's color like that, and those same

47:22.599 --> 47:34.150
racists are trying to tan their faces.

47:34.150 --> 47:41.079
So in this culture of ours we are not bothered
about superficial things.

47:41.079 --> 47:50.059
What we are bothered about is our inner cleanliness,
inner beauty, but that doesn't mean that you

47:50.059 --> 47:55.859
should move about like primitive people, no.

47:55.859 --> 47:58.880
But if there is inner beauty, then outer beauty
comes.

47:58.880 --> 48:01.459
You will never find Me dirtily dressed.

48:01.459 --> 48:07.079
You will never find Me without a sari on,
even when I sleep I wear a sari, because in

48:07.079 --> 48:18.160
the night also I have to work, so how can
I go in My dressing-gown to the other world?

48:18.160 --> 48:25.359
So a person who is a Sahaja yogi has to be
an extremely neat and a clean person, but

48:25.359 --> 48:28.989
not to tell others, but should be himself
or herself.

48:28.989 --> 48:33.769
That's one of the things are very important,
because others will see you, like loonies,

48:33.769 --> 48:36.119
who's going to believe you?

48:36.119 --> 48:42.329
So the one effect is from the Mother, you
take from the Source, for what?

48:42.329 --> 48:51.180
To be that illuminated quality, in you, so
that others see you as something great and

48:51.180 --> 48:55.229
adore you, worship you.

48:55.229 --> 49:00.319
This is this far we have come, now, how your
personality should be.

49:00.319 --> 49:06.259
But now, when you are dealing with others,
know that they are human beings made by God,

49:06.259 --> 49:11.349
not by Sahaja yogis by any chance.

49:11.349 --> 49:16.200
And they will be tomorrow's Sahaja yogis,
may be higher Sahaja yogis than you.

49:16.200 --> 49:23.049
So when we are dealing with others also, talk
to them in a gentle way.

49:23.049 --> 49:24.069
Be kind to them.

49:24.069 --> 49:27.940
Of course we are against gurus, against cults,
against all these people.

49:27.940 --> 49:35.479
But as soon as they come, if you say: "Oh,
you are a bhoot", the person will do right-about-turn

49:35.479 --> 49:39.369
and go away.

49:39.369 --> 49:50.150
So you are not given this power to be abrupt
or to be arrogant with others, not given.

49:50.150 --> 49:57.859
Now all such people are coming down, calming
down because they see that what helps is your

49:57.859 --> 50:02.630
gentle, kindly, firm attitude.

50:02.630 --> 50:05.609
Only after Sahaja Yoga you can combine all
these qualities.

50:05.609 --> 50:14.559
You'll be firm, you'll be alert, you'll be
gentle and compassionate, smiling, but not

50:14.559 --> 50:16.359
making fun of others.

50:16.359 --> 50:26.359
So then you become a personality who is alert:
to see what is the reaction they're having

50:26.359 --> 50:29.319
on others, this is very important to be seen.

50:29.319 --> 50:32.689
So now you start witnessing others.

50:32.689 --> 50:34.839
What is your reaction on others?

50:34.839 --> 50:40.459
I have seen many a times, a new Sahaja yogi
comes in.

50:40.459 --> 50:47.529
The person is trying to say something, and
the girl starts giggling or laughing.

50:47.529 --> 50:52.420
One should not, at that time, because the
person might think that, "They're making fool

50:52.420 --> 50:57.650
of me, or they're thinking that I'm a stupid
person, or something wrong with me."

50:57.650 --> 51:01.449
That person will become self-conscious, I
won't be able to give realization to that

51:01.449 --> 51:02.609
person.

51:02.609 --> 51:09.599
But if somebody is sitting before Me and I'm
trying to help that person, know that it's

51:09.599 --> 51:16.109
a very important moment of this gentleman's
life.

51:16.109 --> 51:18.170
We have got it, so what?

51:18.170 --> 51:25.259
When we are pulling out somebody, when we
are helping out somebody, do we laugh?

51:25.259 --> 51:34.170
That's the time you have to be very concerned
and very much serious, to do the job.

51:34.170 --> 51:39.579
Every quality and mood has its own place,
like nose is at its own place, eyes at its

51:39.579 --> 51:40.579
own place.

51:40.579 --> 51:50.279
In the same way, all these moods that we have,
have their own places.

51:50.279 --> 51:55.979
And that is what is lost in modern society.

51:55.979 --> 52:03.099
So when I am trying to help somebody, you
should be all concern about that person.

52:03.099 --> 52:06.779
How does this come in to us from the Source?

52:06.779 --> 52:09.910
How much you are concerned about Me?

52:09.910 --> 52:16.449
Supposing I am thirsty, you will feel thirsty.

52:16.449 --> 52:19.150
You'll immediately say, "Mother, I'll get
You some water."

52:19.150 --> 52:23.219
But you may not even ask Me, just bring it
here, keep it there.

52:23.219 --> 52:26.180
Or just make some tea for Me or look after
Me.

52:26.180 --> 52:29.589
Do this or do that.

52:29.589 --> 52:32.769
In little, little things you should watch.

52:32.769 --> 52:36.410
The concern is not in saying something, asking
something.

52:36.410 --> 52:37.880
You don't ask.

52:37.880 --> 52:47.249
Don't ask Mother, you just do it.

52:47.249 --> 52:51.609
That's how, when you start doing it, you will
understand what you are doing to others.

52:51.609 --> 52:59.401
So the reflection on others, how they reflect
about you also is very important, and you

52:59.401 --> 53:03.449
have to be alert.

53:03.449 --> 53:06.489
Suddenly you say something, and everybody
disappears.

53:06.489 --> 53:10.460
You must know they are not yet Sahaja yogis,
they are to be brought in, so you have to

53:10.460 --> 53:16.790
very carefully bring them around.

53:16.790 --> 53:23.809
Then with Sahaja yogis, among yourselves how
you behave is extremely important for others

53:23.809 --> 53:25.769
to see.

53:25.769 --> 53:33.660
We must cherish each other's company, we must
cherish.

53:33.660 --> 53:38.450
To meet some Sahaja yogi somewhere, "Ah, what
a joy it is to see someone, to talk to someone

53:38.450 --> 53:39.729
on the phone."

53:39.729 --> 53:46.900
But because we are so insular, so selfish,
so greedy, and sometimes very circumcised

53:46.900 --> 53:55.779
[should read 'circumscribed'] I should say,
or absolutely engulfed into our past, we cannot

53:55.779 --> 54:02.479
do that, we do not feel that joy, we cannot
adore another Sahaja yogi, we do not enjoy

54:02.479 --> 54:08.069
another Sahaja yogi, we cannot cherish his
company.

54:08.069 --> 54:12.839
That means this finger cannot feel this finger.

54:12.839 --> 54:17.790
It's like a developing, what you call, a disease
called leprosy.

54:17.790 --> 54:20.400
Nerves are finished.

54:20.400 --> 54:22.789
Nerve endings are not there.

54:22.789 --> 54:31.739
You cannot feel the joy of other Sahaja yogis.

54:31.739 --> 54:38.660
And this is only possible if you get over
your personal interests.

54:38.660 --> 54:46.859
When people come in Sahaja Yoga in the beginning,
they have personal interests, like say somebody

54:46.859 --> 54:54.089
is trying to sell something, so they would
like to sell it to Sahaja yogis.

54:54.089 --> 54:58.680
Or they are arranging something, they would
like Sahaja yogis to do it.

54:58.680 --> 55:02.630
See, personal interest, to use Sahaja yogis
for their own purposes.

55:02.630 --> 55:11.499
As a result of that I've seen some people
become so insular that nobody helps them,

55:11.499 --> 55:15.819
no work is done by them; if there's a telephone,
nobody will say, "I'll get it."

55:15.819 --> 55:18.609
That's American quality, they'll say, "I'll
get it."

55:18.609 --> 55:20.380
Is regarded good.

55:20.380 --> 55:27.049
Not in England, they'll be all sitting, quiet.

55:27.049 --> 55:32.239
Even when they have eaten the food, they have
to pay the money, they'll look this side,

55:32.239 --> 55:36.739
and some poor Indian student will pay for
all of them.

55:36.739 --> 55:38.279
"I won't look", they say.

55:38.279 --> 55:39.279
"Now paid."

55:39.279 --> 55:40.559
Now they are normal.

55:40.559 --> 55:44.749
It's very low-level.

55:44.749 --> 55:50.349
Is extremely low-level behavior.

55:50.349 --> 56:02.059
And this is what one has to learn, that you
have to cherish others, give presents to others.

56:02.059 --> 56:11.049
"You're going there; “Oh, now…"; like
the other day I met a lady, she had liked

56:11.049 --> 56:15.759
one of My rings of emerald.

56:15.759 --> 56:22.219
That's My family ring so I can't give away,
you see, I'll have to ask C.P. and he may

56:22.219 --> 56:27.099
not like it, because after all I have no right
on it, I have to give it to My children, all

56:27.099 --> 56:28.099
right?

56:28.099 --> 56:32.189
But I found an emerald somewhere, beautiful,
so I kept it with Me.

56:32.189 --> 56:34.349
The other day when I gave her, she was so
enamored.

56:34.349 --> 56:38.179
I said, "You liked My ring, I couldn't give
you My ring, so.."

56:38.179 --> 56:41.699
She said to Me, "You mean to say, I would
have taken Your ring?"

56:41.699 --> 56:46.009
I said, "I would have forced it on you, but
I couldn't give you, so I thought of it.

56:46.009 --> 56:48.880
I just saw it somewhere so I got it for you."

56:48.880 --> 56:49.880
She said, "How thoughtful."

56:49.880 --> 56:53.209
But it's all in My head.

56:53.209 --> 57:02.719
I, whenever I get it, a chance, you see, so
somebody says, "Oh, I like it", keep it in

57:02.719 --> 57:03.719
mind.

57:03.719 --> 57:06.709
Next time, even a flower.

57:06.709 --> 57:11.599
You must cherish their companies, because
it's such a great thing to have somebody who

57:11.599 --> 57:14.890
understands you, your spirit, and they have
the spirit.

57:14.890 --> 57:16.630
Such a great thing.

57:16.630 --> 57:21.829
How can you be unkind to each other?

57:21.829 --> 57:24.009
That hurts Me the most of all.

57:24.009 --> 57:33.490
And the first thing and the foremost thing
you have to give Me is congenial, beautiful,

57:33.490 --> 57:41.880
loving group, that they love each other.

57:41.880 --> 57:46.199
If that's achieved, that you really love,
beyond your personal considerations.

57:46.199 --> 57:53.729
I mean, of course, in Sahaja Yoga there are
now not many people who try to make money,

57:53.729 --> 57:55.859
but try to make comfort for themselves.

57:55.859 --> 57:59.319
They must have the best room, they must have
the best place, they must have...

57:59.319 --> 58:02.420
"I didn't get this, I should have it, this,
that."

58:02.420 --> 58:03.789
Try to do more than others.

58:03.789 --> 58:09.980
I know sometimes people take advantage of
you, but they will go out of Sahaja Yoga very

58:09.980 --> 58:10.980
soon.

58:10.980 --> 58:15.420
So be sure that you become generous about
it, very generous.

58:15.420 --> 58:26.880
And generosity should start from your own
Sahaja yogi brothers and sisters.

58:26.880 --> 58:36.229
In the culture of Sahaja Yoga we have to have
a full imbibement bubbling through our nerves,

58:36.229 --> 58:40.130
the sense of chastity.

58:40.130 --> 58:45.799
That is a must, whether you like it or not.

58:45.799 --> 58:57.640
There should be no bad intentions about any
other person, of relationships which are not

58:57.640 --> 58:58.640
pure.

58:58.640 --> 59:11.059
Absolutely pure relationships, pure eyes without
any adultery, adulteration I would call it.

59:11.059 --> 59:20.640
Clean eyes is the basic of Sahaja Yoga.

59:20.640 --> 59:27.489
Steadfast clean eyes, because your eyes are
very powerful.

59:27.489 --> 59:32.989
You don't know how powerful they are.

59:32.989 --> 59:44.670
So to make it that way, to practice, move
your attention inward and towards the Sahasrara.

59:44.670 --> 59:45.670
You can.

59:45.670 --> 59:50.219
With your eyes you suck in.

59:50.219 --> 59:57.549
Even by looking at Me with the shraddha, with
the joy, you just suck it inside, My image.

59:57.549 --> 01:00:05.420
Put it on your Sahasrara, put it in your heart,
you can do it.

01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:07.719
It's very joy giving.

01:00:07.719 --> 01:00:13.509
When you put it in the Sahasrara, then you
get the knowledge.

01:00:13.509 --> 01:00:20.699
When you put it in your heart, you get the
joy; and when you put it on your liver, then

01:00:20.699 --> 01:00:26.049
you get the power of action.

01:00:26.049 --> 01:00:32.289
From the photograph also you can do it, suck
in, move it.

01:00:32.289 --> 01:00:43.249
But that is shown in the way you behave towards
others, completely confident, gentle; no arrogance.

01:00:43.249 --> 01:00:55.969
Neither the neck up like that or like that,
but in the center in a very dignified manner.

01:00:55.969 --> 01:01:10.319
So in the culture of Sahaj, because the spirit
is the dignity, is the majesty, is the glory

01:01:10.319 --> 01:01:14.019
of God, you have to judge yourself.

01:01:14.019 --> 01:01:20.329
"Did I say something which is not respecting
my spirit?

01:01:20.329 --> 01:01:27.209
Did I do something that is not glorious?"

01:01:27.209 --> 01:01:31.489
Like I've seen people, when I'm there, they'll
go on asking Me hundred questions.

01:01:31.489 --> 01:01:33.529
"Should it be white towel?

01:01:33.529 --> 01:01:34.529
Green towel?

01:01:34.529 --> 01:01:39.339
Should I do this, should I do that?"

01:01:39.339 --> 01:01:40.739
Why?

01:01:40.739 --> 01:01:42.979
Because we don't live with choices.

01:01:42.979 --> 01:01:48.039
We live with whatever we get it, and there
is dignity in that.

01:01:48.039 --> 01:01:54.469
If you start doing choices, it's stupid.

01:01:54.469 --> 01:01:59.220
In a group of Sahaja yogis, the food, "What
will you have?"

01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:03.339
They'll take forty-five minutes to decide,
if you go in a restaurant, because the first,

01:02:03.339 --> 01:02:08.119
the consciousness, "We are paying for it",
and somebody will have this, somebody will

01:02:08.119 --> 01:02:09.119
have that.

01:02:09.119 --> 01:02:11.459
The poor waiter will run away.

01:02:11.459 --> 01:02:14.630
But why should we have different?

01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:18.940
It's just the same.

01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:26.349
Whatever Mother is having we'll have, finished.

01:02:26.349 --> 01:02:29.699
But if not that, at least whatever everybody
is having, "Why have separately?"

01:02:29.699 --> 01:02:34.150
Choices are not there in Sahaja Yoga, remember
this word very clearly.

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:37.900
Choices of this, choices of that, I don't
like it, I like that.

01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:42.670
This is not good, that is not good.

01:02:42.670 --> 01:02:50.789
Because we need everything on the level of
vibrations, then the choice is coming.

01:02:50.789 --> 01:03:00.549
Like, if the vibrations are not good we'll
not say it, but we'll not have it.

01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:05.559
But not question of whether green or red or
yellow or white.

01:03:05.559 --> 01:03:09.440
And that is what they are making fool out
of you.

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:15.079
They will put one name, Cartier, finished.

01:03:15.079 --> 01:03:18.609
People will pay any amount for that Cartier.

01:03:18.609 --> 01:03:23.959
Is any ordinary stuff, it is nothing special.

01:03:23.959 --> 01:03:26.059
But you see that ego, "I've got the Cartier.

01:03:26.059 --> 01:03:31.329
I paid more to show that I've paid more, that
I've been a fool."

01:03:31.329 --> 01:03:39.459
To pay more for something that's so cheapish;
that's what they're playing upon - remember

01:03:39.459 --> 01:03:40.459
that.

01:03:40.459 --> 01:03:48.589
So you have to understand that when you are
a Sahaj personality, you have your own dignity.

01:03:48.589 --> 01:03:51.980
These things do not give dignity to you.

01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:58.420
You give them dignity.

01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:07.369
But that doesn't mean tomorrow you come like
a clown, or like a limbo on your nose.

01:04:07.369 --> 01:04:12.890
Of course I must see the other point always,
because it just slips out that side.

01:04:12.890 --> 01:04:20.250
When you become dignified, you will wear always
something that is dignified.

01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:22.039
You will do all that is dignified.

01:04:22.039 --> 01:04:24.700
Is automatically you become dignified.

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:28.089
It's nothing artificial.

01:04:28.089 --> 01:04:35.709
So dignity that comes, as you see your Mother.

01:04:35.709 --> 01:04:42.039
Whatever you give Me in Puja I take it, all
right, but otherwise you cannot give Me anything

01:04:42.039 --> 01:04:43.039
else.

01:04:43.039 --> 01:04:49.279
If you give Me, I'll return it, somehow.

01:04:49.279 --> 01:04:52.489
Somehow I'll return it.

01:04:52.489 --> 01:04:58.920
A person who is money-oriented cannot have
dignity, because you see him like a beggar.

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:02.040
See, if there’s money-orientation is too
much, he comes down to that level, you can

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:04.510
see it, there cannot be dignity there.

01:05:04.510 --> 01:05:09.009
A man who is power-oriented is an idiot.

01:05:09.009 --> 01:05:11.700
He looks like an idiot.

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:13.169
So we cannot become idiots.

01:05:13.169 --> 01:05:14.169
All right.

01:05:14.169 --> 01:05:16.779
So we cannot be power-oriented.

01:05:16.779 --> 01:05:24.970
The one who is sort of a romantic or a love-oriented,
is a stupid fellow.

01:05:24.970 --> 01:05:27.259
He behaves like a stupid fellow.

01:05:27.259 --> 01:05:30.599
On the street they go on kissing each other
all the time.

01:05:30.599 --> 01:05:32.160
"Where are you going?"

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:39.079
"To the divorce case, but last bit we are
thinking of having some kisses."

01:05:39.079 --> 01:05:42.970
Self-respect is the thing.

01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:44.369
Self is your spirit.

01:05:44.369 --> 01:05:47.589
The respect of the spirit should give you
that dignity.

01:05:47.589 --> 01:05:53.709
But in privacy you are gentle with your husband,
you are gentle with your wife.

01:05:53.709 --> 01:06:00.949
You must learn how to be gentle with her in
privacy, not in public.

01:06:00.949 --> 01:06:02.669
That's horrible.

01:06:02.669 --> 01:06:03.829
Specially in India.

01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:07.650
I am told that people go round with that romanticism
and all that.

01:06:07.650 --> 01:06:13.989
So please, don't do all those romantic stuff
in India, it's very embarrassing for Me, very

01:06:13.989 --> 01:06:15.140
embarrassing.

01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:20.140
So we cannot do things which embarrasses our
Mother.

01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:24.919
Once you start knowing that, "This will embarrass
Mother, we can't do this", automatically you

01:06:24.919 --> 01:06:25.919
are helping.

01:06:25.919 --> 01:06:32.400
So when it is related with Me, immediately,
"What will Mother think of in me?

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.519
Is this the way to behave towards Mother?"

01:06:34.519 --> 01:06:46.269
Immediately you will get the reward, as that
thing working through you, as if you become

01:06:46.269 --> 01:06:47.390
that nature.

01:06:47.390 --> 01:06:50.789
Sahaja culture is a sahaja nature.

01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:53.939
Automatically you will do it.

01:06:53.939 --> 01:07:00.910
You'll talk in that manner, you will speak
in that manner, you’ll live in that manner.

01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:07.190
I mean, I have seen people who have never
known Me, on a trunk call or a telephone,

01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:08.390
they recognize.

01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:13.219
They know I am something special; if they
are sensitive enough.

01:07:13.219 --> 01:07:17.759
From My photograph, the way I sit, the way
I talk, immediately everyone asks.

01:07:17.759 --> 01:07:21.589
The other day where I went for the meeting
with My husband, everybody was asking, "Who

01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:22.589
is this lady?"

01:07:22.589 --> 01:07:23.589
"Who is this lady?"

01:07:23.589 --> 01:07:27.660
"Who is this lady?"

01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:29.009
There's something in the personality.

01:07:29.009 --> 01:07:35.730
I talk to everyone nicely, I'm very sweet.

01:07:35.730 --> 01:07:39.309
We cannot be slavish, and we cannot enslave
anyone.

01:07:39.309 --> 01:07:47.280
We have to cherish, even human beings we have
to cherish, because they are us.

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:53.140
Not to despise anyone, not to laugh at anyone.

01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:59.720
In the culture of Sahaj, you have to become
an expert: expertise.

01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:07.599
Expertise comes through your adherence to
your Mother.

01:08:07.599 --> 01:08:12.279
Expertise: you all should be an expert, and
who will give you the certificate is your

01:08:12.279 --> 01:08:14.809
Mother only - who else?

01:08:14.809 --> 01:08:23.880
I may not say so, but your spirit will say
that, and not your ego.

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:30.159
In this short time whatever was possible,
it's such a big subject, culture is; you cannot.

01:08:30.159 --> 01:08:36.949
But I've talked to you, I would not say in
a very analytical way, but in a very synthetic

01:08:36.949 --> 01:08:39.119
manner.

01:08:39.119 --> 01:08:41.920
So I've given you very synthesis of the whole
thing.

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:48.779
"Analytical" would be one, two, three, four,
five - cut short - two, three, four, five,

01:08:48.779 --> 01:08:49.809
like that.

01:08:49.809 --> 01:08:51.889
It's not like that.

01:08:51.889 --> 01:08:54.250
And that is how you have to speak to people.

01:08:54.250 --> 01:08:59.199
One, this is so; two, this is so; three, this
is so; finished.

01:08:59.199 --> 01:09:01.099
You are not Sahaja yogis.

01:09:01.099 --> 01:09:08.230
In your speeches if you talk like that, finished.

01:09:08.230 --> 01:09:14.299
But before saying something or doing something,
give a little idea where you are leading the

01:09:14.299 --> 01:09:20.579
people, so they are not frittered away, attention
is not frittered away.

01:09:20.579 --> 01:09:32.469
Give a little idea, as I say, or else while
talking, bring them to a point which is important,

01:09:32.469 --> 01:09:38.350
so that they wait in the sentence to come
to that point.

01:09:38.350 --> 01:09:45.009
But make the whole sentence look so, that
it is going towards certain points, so always

01:09:45.009 --> 01:09:54.500
a Sahaja yogi must make a point out of what
they talk, not just babbling, talking.

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:58.489
What is the point you are going to make?

01:09:58.489 --> 01:10:04.000
Whatever they do, they have to know, "What
are we going to achieve out of it?"

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.179
Now, marriage.

01:10:05.179 --> 01:10:07.869
"What are we going to achieve out of marriage?"

01:10:07.869 --> 01:10:11.710
A family, house, everybody has, even a donkey
has that.

01:10:11.710 --> 01:10:13.849
What's so great?

01:10:13.849 --> 01:10:19.570
We are going to achieve a family unit where
realized souls are to be born, we're going

01:10:19.570 --> 01:10:31.340
to look after them in a proper way, and then
we are going to emit that unit into this world,

01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:39.179
like a sparkling diamond set in the beautiful
setting of a family, giving light to the whole

01:10:39.179 --> 01:10:42.219
world.

01:10:42.219 --> 01:10:52.480
So one's life should not be pointless, and
talk should not be pointless, and every moment

01:10:52.480 --> 01:11:03.369
should be filled with achievements of your
visions and dreams, slowly and steadily, which

01:11:03.369 --> 01:11:09.210
is not at all difficult.

01:11:09.210 --> 01:11:15.469
If you can get rid of ego and superego, finished,
that's all - simple as that.

01:11:15.469 --> 01:11:25.570
May God bless you all.

01:11:25.570 --> 01:11:35.659
Mm.. good.. nice.. relaxed, eh?

01:11:35.659 --> 01:11:37.679
Relaxed.

01:11:37.679 --> 01:11:39.699
Witness.

01:11:39.699 --> 01:11:49.250
Everyone cleared out, I think.

01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:50.250
And no more…

01:11:50.250 --> 01:11:56.409
one more thing I must say last, as I've said
it before, which I've not said here, no-one

01:11:56.409 --> 01:12:01.640
is going to say that bhoot did it, because
such a person will be sent away to the bhoot

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:05.030
clan, not to Sahaja Yoga.

01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:09.989
Don't put your responsibility on the bhoots.

01:12:09.989 --> 01:12:14.860
Either you are a bhoot or you are a Sahaja
yogi, one of the two, you can't be both.
