Sahaja Culture and Ego
New Jersey Ashram, USA

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:40.260
October 26, 1985

00:00:40.260 --> 00:01:07.240
Today I was thinking of talking, telling you
about the Sahaja Culture.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.770
Now we are formed in dharma, Vishwa Dharma.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.840
But it must have a culture.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:25.439
So far in all the religions there is no combination
of religion and culture.

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.969
No religion has.

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:31.359
That's why everywhere you find different cultures.

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:37.109
Say in India, people who follow Hindu religion
have different cultures in different places.

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:42.740
They are living in Lucknow, or say in U.P.,
they have a Muslim culture.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.020
More Islamic style.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.310
They'll eat in one plate, do all kinds of
things which normally a South Indian won't

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.990
do, and the South Indians have a different
culture from Maharashtrians.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.320
So even in a religion like Hindu religion
where culture is important, very important,

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.740
we find varieties.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.729
So the cultures get influenced by the neighboring
cultures or surrounding cultures, and that's

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.890
how people get lost.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.940
When you establish a religion like this, Vishwa
Dharma, it's not like any other religion.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.640
It's the real religion within us, and this
reality comes to us because now we are one

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.120
with the Spirit.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.420
So when we talk of Sahaja Culture, it is the
culture of the Spirit.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.420
Now what is a culture?

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.970
First of all let us see what is a culture
is.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.700
So the culture is the pattern of behavior
we have with others.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.760
Is a common pattern of behavior we are supposed
to have with others.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.100
Like in English language, for example, we'll
say "Thank you".

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.460
Even if somebody murders, you may say, "Thank
you".

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:05.480
Or the person who murders you can say, "Sorry".

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.360
On the phone one may say, just if they say
something you can't hear, "Sorry?"

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.360
Every time, "Sorry".

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.631
As if "sorry" is a word so easily to be used.

00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:16.330
I mean if you are sorry, why are you sorry
for that?

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.330
"Sorry?"

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.180
On the phone they used to first say, "I beg
your pardon?", was sensible; but now I find

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.400
everybody, A to Z, says, "Sorry?"

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.140
I mean, it has no meaning, because what are
you sorry about?

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.620
Says "Sorry?"

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.231
For everything they are sorry.

00:03:31.231 --> 00:03:33.330
Or we can say in English language, when we
speak, "I'm afraid".

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.790
You see, it's very common, "I'm afraid".

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.930
What are you afraid of?

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.530
The whole world is afraid of you.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:48.610
So this is the culture, what we talk of, any
culture as such, becomes artificial, is not

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.790
spontaneous, doesn't come from reality.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:57.980
It has no meaning; sometimes it is pointless,
absolutely pointless to stick to certain cultures.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.390
So the culture of the Spirit doesn't change.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.510
It's universal, and is higher than any other
culture.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.010
Apart from that it integrates all the essences
of all the cultures.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:18.810
So
it emanates from the spirit.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.160
Now, spirit has two sides.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.842
One side which you see, the another you don't
see, like the moon.

00:04:26.842 --> 00:04:32.790
The side you see is outside with other people,
other Sahaja Yogis, other people, other societies,

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:40.570
which are not yourself, absolutely.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:48.120
The other side you don't see is the relationship
with God Almighty, relationship with your

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.290
Mother.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:58.870
If the other side is not all right, the behavioral
side outside could become artificial, could

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.410
become crooked and not Sahaj.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.680
So it's the other way round than any other
culture.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.430
To know any other culture what do we go?

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.970
We see how they talk, what is their language,
how they speak, how they behave: all the outside

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.350
things we get.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:21.590
We must know "thank you" if we want to know
English language, must know "thank you", "please",

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.210
all that.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:29.380
But if you want to know the Sahaja culture,
you have to know your Mother, and you have

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.730
to know God Almighty.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:38.190
And the relationship between your Mother and
the God Almighty has to be absolutely perfect.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.700
Then there's no problem.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:49.740
But that, the relationship, if it is not all
right, you cannot have artificial Sahaj culture.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.710
That is one thing for sure.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.490
Artificial Sahaj culture is not all right.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:03.311
I would say that India has, in its basics,
the culture of the spirit, India has; because

00:06:03.311 --> 00:06:16.380
for traditions and traditions in India, and
for ages, people have been seeking the truth.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:23.440
Spiritually they are endowed, because of the
saints.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:31.610
They are blessed specially because they have
been seekers, not of material things, but

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.500
of the spirit.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:41.430
Specially in Maharashtra, we should say, because
the Kundalini is there always like a magnet.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:47.130
People are attracted because Shri Ganesha
being the magnet, attracted towards God and

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:48.130
spirit.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:52.840
So they form a pattern, but there is lot of
artificiality in that also has grown.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:07:01.960
We must admit that there is lot, lot of artificiality,
falsehood, nonsense that has grown into it,

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:07.610
because the religion fell into the hands of,
spiritual religion fell into the hands of

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.400
gross, horrible so-called Brahmins who were
not realized souls.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:18.620
So the whole culture has become so nonsensical
sometimes that you don't know where to look.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:29.580
But to have the culture, first of all, culture
is developed through meditation, by facing

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.729
yourself.

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:45.110
First of all you should face yourself, how
you feel about your Mother and about God Almighty.

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:52.020
First of all, how much liberty you take of
your Mother?

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:57.350
How much granted, take for granted your Mother?

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:02.710
She's a Mahamaya.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:06.720
Even the first "M" is difficult to understand.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:14.990
So when you start taking liberties, all the
time putting your pressure on Her, all the

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:24.759
time trying to attract Her attention, Her
time, or writing letters eleven pages, all

00:08:24.759 --> 00:08:26.660
that, is one side.

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:32.000
Another side is complete indifference to your
Mother.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.539
So it is to be known through your heart.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:37.290
You don't have to talk to Me.

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:41.930
I know whose heart is pulsating.

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:47.680
Perhaps I'm the only person who knows really
what you are.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.250
You may not be knowing yourself also.

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:59.050
I may not say, but I know you in all details,
out of which I may say little bit, because

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:03.860
I am too gentle to say things.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.260
Because again of Sahaj culture.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:11.760
Because of Sahaj culture, I cannot say everything
to you on your face.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:17.390
I'm correcting it, trying to correct it, correct
it; if not possible, then I say to you.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:21.040
Then in that you have to also see how much
worshipful you are.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:28.370
Some people, though they spend more time with
Me, remain with Me, want to be with Me, it

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:33.600
is only when they feel surrendered, also.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.881
So it should not be confused: if somebody
is spending more time with Me, you should

00:09:36.881 --> 00:09:38.710
not condemn yourself for that.

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:40.000
It's all right.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.580
But how far you are surrendered is the point.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:48.390
Now, if you are surrendered, how do you see
the surrendering in a person?

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:54.770
You see it has one side and the another is
the expression.

00:09:54.770 --> 00:10:04.340
Say a person who is surrendered doesn't talk
much to Me, doesn't talk, he listens, doesn't

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.340
talk.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:10.710
Common sense, he listens.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:16.890
Even people who are very good, I've seen when
I'm talking, they'll put in their own words

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.300
in between.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.779
People who are very good, I should say.

00:10:21.779 --> 00:10:24.490
So the surrendering is not full.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.750
Then the time, they become very conscious
of the time.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:31.600
Who has made the time?

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.110
But the person won't come directly and tell
Me, but tell somebody else, "Go and tell Mother,

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:37.490
She has to go at this time."

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:46.220
I know everything, who tells whom, who goes
to whom, who is telling someone, who is time-bound.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.760
And then I flout it.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:56.220
I know what time to reach, what is the auspicious
time, how it will work out.

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.950
Surrendering has to be to that point, that
you shouldn't worry.

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:04.130
I would say Dumahl is one of them who is a
very great surrendered fellow.

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:07.330
When I went there I was very tired, and he
said.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.610
"Mother, if You want to rest You can rest."

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:10.779
I said, "Yes, I want to rest."

00:11:10.779 --> 00:11:12.140
So he just left Me alone.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:17.950
I was really very tired because I had a very
long journey, and then this and that, and

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:21.209
then I went down all the way there.

00:11:21.209 --> 00:11:24.530
I thought, "I'll lie down, and sleep off.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:31.800
" Of course, as I know that everything has
to be done at right time, I just went down.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:42.200
And we had a program of My reception at one
place in a village, and they were all waiting

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.170
for Me there.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:46.170
And I was sleeping; he wouldn't wake Me up.

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:47.170
He wouldn't wake Me up.

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:50.650
He said, "Everything will be all right.

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:53.800
Tell them when Mother will come."

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:58.420
So there was sun on, they were all sitting
under the tree, sun was scorchingly hot.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:03.330
They were nicely having a nice nap under the
tree and all that.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:08.339
All the villagers arrived, everybody arrived,
everything worked out.

00:12:08.339 --> 00:12:12.890
And when I got up it was about five-thirty,
then he told Me that, "Mother, I didn't tell

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:13.990
You the program."

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:15.230
He never tells Me.

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:19.160
If I get something written, well and good,
but, "You were sleeping, I didn't want to

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.160
disturb You."

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.160
"What's the program?"

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.160
"It was at three o'clock."

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.160
I said, "Three o'clock.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.160
Why didn't you tell Me?

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.350
Why didn't you wake Me?"

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:29.530
He said, "You were awake, I knew You were
awake, Mother.

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:30.530
It's all right."

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:38.840
So we started off at six o'clock.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:39.950
Sun had gone down.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:46.830
By that time they arranged beautiful lights
and fireworks and everything, and all the

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:50.610
rushing about was finished, they're very well
settled.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:55.750
And the people from distant villages had also
arrived, and they had organized them so well,

00:12:55.750 --> 00:13:00.860
and they had a proper time, and are very happy
that I came late because sun was not there,

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.210
so scorchingly hot.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:09.000
By the time we reached about seven o'clock
it was night and they illumined the lights,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.010
and the diwali like this was put up everywhere,
and they got everything, they had sufficient

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:16.899
time to do everything.

00:13:16.899 --> 00:13:25.990
Then Dumahl said, "I knew, Mother, You are
awake, and You were managing."

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:29.980
If one can understand that, then you will
not try to organize Me.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:33.550
You can just tell Me, "We have to leave at
this time."

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:39.730
But if I don't have to leave, I will not leave
whatever you may do.

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:48.380
In My own sweet way; you will never find Me
obstinate, but I am.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.710
Because I know what is right is what is right,
and has to be done that way.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:55.350
But otherwise I'm very calm, I am not bothered.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:14:01.120
I never organize you, I never hurry you, I
never do anything that should upset you.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:10.930
Spirit is never upset, never excited, never
hurries, and never is what you call that "go-go"

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:13.050
business.

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.880
Like now, we have to go to the airport.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:19.900
You'll find everybody was like an aeroplane
- round, round, round, round.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:20.900
What has happened?

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:21.900
"Oh, we had to go?

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:22.900
We'd.."

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:23.900
"We have to go, all right.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:24.900
So what?"

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:31.079
The whole thing is, all these excitements
and all these things come to us because we

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:32.399
are outside.

00:14:32.399 --> 00:14:34.310
But if you are one with your spirit you're
absolutely calm, absolutely calm, "All right,

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:38.910
we have to go, all right, we'll reach there.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:40.320
Doesn't matter."

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:45.680
The other day we had to go for some shopping,
I was trying to buy some saris for Indian

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:46.680
ladies.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:47.890
We got lost.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:49.380
I never bothered them at all.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:52.240
They were going round and round, and round
and round.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.300
And then Danny realized and said, "I think
perhaps we had to leave vibrations in all

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.300
these places."

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.820
I said, "Correct."

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.770
And for about two hours I think, we were roaming
about.

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:03.769
Anybody else would be saying, "What's this?

00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:06.620
You can't find the place, what's the matter
with you?”

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:07.620
Calm.

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:12.839
We reached the shop at the right time, got
everything at the right time, did everything,

00:15:12.839 --> 00:15:14.130
came back at right time.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:17.370
Everything was first class, nothing went wrong.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:21.870
But anybody in My place, I tell you, that
time would have been, "Oh God, this, that."

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:22.870
Why are you saving time?

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:27.880
For what are you saving time?

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.920
So we miss the present, and that's one thing
spirit never misses.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.870
It's always in the present.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:38.630
That's the reality.

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:44.880
Now in the West people are very futuristic,
extremely futuristic, and their futuristicness

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:50.780
sometimes takes them to points, say for example
if they have to go by train.

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.100
So instead of arriving at the right station,
they'll go to the station which is further

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.100
on.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.790
And then again they'll arrive at the further
on.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:00.320
The train will never reach them.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.940
Sort of temperament they have.

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:10.620
So one should not plan at all anything like
that, that fixes you.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:15.570
But at this moment, if I have to be told that
we have to go at this time, is all right,

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:16.570
finished now.

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:18.720
At this moment I've told, is recorded, finished.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.720
All right?

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.160
So it's gone into the memory.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.830
There's nothing to worry about it now.

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:26.310
Now, present moment, what are we doing?

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:30.160
In a very calm way, witness it.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.910
Witness yourself, now, witness yourself.

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:36.450
"Where is my mind going?"

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:41.920
Now somebody who has to cook must be thinking,
"Oh, I have to get this, I have to get that."

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:46.950
Once you start saying that "I have to do it",
you'll never be able to do it that way.

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:53.660
But you said, "All right, just now I'm in
meditation."

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.260
Every moment, "I am in meditation."

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:03.680
Everything will walk up to you, even matter,
and you'll get the right things at the right

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.250
place.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:10.809
You'll meet right people at the right place.

00:17:10.809 --> 00:17:14.220
The other day we were just walking, strolling
around.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.220
Whom do we find there?

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:17.220
Carolyn.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.010
She just walked out.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:23.470
There is she, I mean I met her.

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:25.370
She said, "Christine is just next door."

00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:29.580
I said, "Let's go," and you should have seen
the joy on her face when she came down, and

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.250
she saw Me.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:35.770
Beautiful experience for Me and her, she was
so happy.

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:38.530
Then we went together.

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:45.530
So when you have so much tied down with your
watch, that means you are not tied down with

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:47.900
your spirit.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:55.779
So a Sahaja yogi, if he sees watch, then he's
not a Sahaja yogi.

00:17:55.779 --> 00:18:00.950
But the other side could be that the Sahaja
yogis are never in time where they have to

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:02.570
be.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:04.970
Very common in England.

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:08.880
I reach always first, to open the door.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:16.060
And to clean it also sometimes.

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:24.059
Now, to take for granted things, as you say,
take for granted, that's not the way Sahaja

00:18:24.059 --> 00:18:25.059
Yoga is.

00:18:25.059 --> 00:18:27.929
You have to be alert, alert, absolutely alert.

00:18:27.929 --> 00:18:31.880
If you are alert, immediately you'll know
"I have to go now at this time.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.140
I have to do it.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:38.010
I have to get this thing now."

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:41.770
If you have to miss something, you are supposed
to miss it.

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:43.320
That's what it is.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:48.559
So, there's a beautiful thing written down,
like they say, "Jai sei rakhahu tase hi rahun"

00:18:48.559 --> 00:18:53.960
- "The way You keep me, the way I am, will
be happy."

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:58.559
So, satisfaction towards yourself, your spirit,
is important.

00:18:58.559 --> 00:19:06.600
Because ego will plan out, "Oh, we'll go there,
we must get for Mother, say, daisies", we

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.600
decide.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.600
"Must get daisies."

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:09.800
You don't find daisies, you're disappointed.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:10.800
Why not?

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:15.020
These are all My flowers, whether they are
daisies or not, they look so nice.

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:18.570
Whatever you get, you get it.

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:20.470
That's the thing wanted.

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:26.720
You know that, that the Divine is working
out everything for you.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:31.370
When you are supposed to get something else,
better have it.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:39.080
Even by mistake, if I lay My hand upon some
things, like a book or something, immediately

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:43.390
I'll open it out and see why this book has
come in My attention; why this fellow has

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:47.669
come in My attention; why this is happening.

00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:53.651
And immediately I find that there’s some
connection, something has to be done, something

00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:57.140
has to be said, something has to be worked
out.

00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:08.520
So for a person who is imbibed with the culture
of spirit, the Sahaj culture, impresses others

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:12.600
by his calmness and relaxed attitude.

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:16.870
Relaxation never means lethargy, by any chance.

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:18.929
It doesn't mean lethargy.

00:20:18.929 --> 00:20:21.880
Lethargy is against relaxation.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.950
A person who is relaxed cannot become lethargic.

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:30.460
"Relaxed" means a person who’s alert and
calm.

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:42.580
These two things for human beings is an impossibility,
because if they are alert, if they are alert

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:44.830
then they're not calm.

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:51.000
If they're unhappy, sad, then they think they
are very, very calm.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.780
So this is one of the things one has to remember,
that you have to witness yourself all the

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:57.690
time.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:59.760
Not to condemn yourself, but witness.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.299
Now I said the word "witness" means "detached".

00:21:03.299 --> 00:21:08.781
Now what happens with this, when you start
condemning yourself, you miss every good point.

00:21:08.781 --> 00:21:20.270
For example, you have some experience of a
sudden height being achieved.

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:21.679
All right?

00:21:21.679 --> 00:21:28.590
At that point you should catch hold of it,
hold on to it, keep doing, but don't forget

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:32.369
that you may go back, no.

00:21:32.369 --> 00:21:36.460
And then wait for another higher moment to
come, hold on to it.

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:39.169
That's how you climb Himalayas.

00:21:39.169 --> 00:21:41.500
But not that, "Oh Ma.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.970
Now it's all right, but what will happen next?"

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:52.260
Then you are gone down, because you have to
face yourself in the way, knowing what are

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.260
your powers.

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:57.900
You are a spirit now, you are no more an ordinary
human being, so you have no business to condemn

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:04.059
yourself, or to degrade yourself, or in any
way to feel unhappy.

00:22:04.059 --> 00:22:05.070
No way.

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:06.600
Past is past.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.140
What happened a moment before is finished.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:10.140
"Now I am going to rise.

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:15.520
Now I am going to rise."

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:27.850
So a person who has a Sahaja culture is not
only spontaneous, but is inspired, is a inspired

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:29.840
personality.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:40.480
A person who is of that kind, an inspired
visionary, then other people get impressed

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:47.570
by such a person that, "See, there's a man
who's inspired, who talks in an inspired way,

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:52.080
in a way that is something very different
from others."

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:58.120
Something new he says, new that is nourishing.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:05.200
Such a personality - like the other day, you
see, we heard the lectures of so many people,

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:11.669
and when the New Zealand Prime Minister was
coming C.P. said, "Now let's go back, because

00:23:11.669 --> 00:23:13.090
we'll have a little tea or something."

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:14.919
I said: "No, you listen to this man.

00:23:14.919 --> 00:23:15.919
He's a realized soul."

00:23:15.919 --> 00:23:16.919
He said, "Really?"

00:23:16.919 --> 00:23:18.230
I said, "Yes, you listen to him."

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:22.190
First everybody was, "He's sitting in New
Zealand, such a little titwit of a country,

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:24.110
what is he going to speak?"

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:26.080
You see, they were moving about, making a…

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:30.870
Within two minutes he captured everybody's
attention, you see, and he was bubbling with

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:37.559
everything, so beautifully, and he spoke all
the points so much different, and so much

00:23:37.559 --> 00:23:39.070
new and so much better.

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:40.070
C.P.

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:41.070
was amazed.

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:42.070
He said, "How do You know?"

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:47.030
I said, "I know, because when I was in New
Zealand I told them he's a realized soul."

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:51.169
And our own Prime Minister is also a realized
soul.

00:23:51.169 --> 00:23:54.740
You'll be surprised, after our Prime Minister
finished his lecture and all that, after two

00:23:54.740 --> 00:24:00.659
or three lectures he was to go; then he turned
round and went to this Australian [Shri Mataji

00:24:00.659 --> 00:24:05.520
may have meant New Zealand] Prime Minister,
only him, went and congratulated him, congratulated

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.520
him.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.330
Congratulated and said something very close
to him.

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:13.020
And the fellow again, you see, flew up into
joy.

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.799
We see it's all there.

00:24:14.799 --> 00:24:16.700
And then he came away.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:17.700
Why?

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:22.810
Because one realized soul understands another
realized soul, and everybody was amazed: why

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:26.950
did he turn to this man alone, and went and
congratulated him?

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:34.080
So such a large country like India represented
by our Prime Minister, goes down all the way

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:39.770
to a little country like New Zealand which
is nothing compared to India, and congratulates.

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:42.500
And that's a developed country, this is a
developing country.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.050
Is something people did not understand.

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:48.700
And the whole joyous atmosphere both of them
shaking hands created.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:58.280
This is Sahaja culture, in which you recognize
a realized soul, the dignity of a realized

00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.550
soul.

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:05.770
So when it comes to relating to others, first
and foremost are Sahaja yogis.

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:13.169
But I've seen most of the people are more
congenial with others, and less congenial

00:25:13.169 --> 00:25:15.980
with Sahaja yogis.

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:22.330
They try to criticize Sahaja yogis all the
time, and I test them.

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:23.700
I sometimes say, "All right.

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:27.030
I don't think this fellow is very good" and
all that.

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:31.370
But when the other person turns round and
shows compassion and says, "No, Mother, I

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:35.789
think it will work out" then I like it.

00:25:35.789 --> 00:25:37.500
I like that.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.840
Or else sometimes I say, "Oh, let them go
away.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.140
There should be no more food for them, it's
all right."

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:47.820
No, Mother, we've made food for them."

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:52.190
So the culture of Sahaj is to give.

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:58.480
Give, and give, and give, and never ask for
a reward.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.929
Never thinks, "What I have to get".

00:26:00.929 --> 00:26:07.610
After all, you have got the highest that anybody
could get.

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:13.170
They said the three heights a human being
can achieve in spirituality, which you all

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:15.440
got in no time.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:22.669
It's called as salokya, samipya, sanidya.

00:26:22.669 --> 00:26:27.950
Salokya is that you should be able to see
God.

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:31.600
That you got.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:38.780
Samipya is the closeness with God.

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:43.860
Sanidya is the togetherness, togetherness.

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:52.030
You have got all these three.

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:55.539
In one incarnation you've got it.

00:26:55.539 --> 00:27:08.800
When Gods incarnated before, nobody knew that
they were Gods.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:12.520
So even they got it, they never knew.

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:18.270
Very few people knew about them.

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:27.600
But even when Christ said He was the Son of
God, who, how many believed Him?

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.030
They crucified Him.

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:33.330
Because they were not realized souls.

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:38.980
But by giving you realization I have given
you that capacity to get all these three blessings

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:40.980
at one shot.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:45.940
I speak your language, I speak your style,
I live with your style, and you understand

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:46.940
Me.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:48.150
There is no problem.

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:53.710
But with other Gods, imagine if I were Mahakali
today, what would have happened.

00:27:53.710 --> 00:28:00.870
You would be all upside-down there hanging,
seeing Me from the other way round.

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:05.350
I don't know what would have happened - or
any one of them.

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:16.059
So the three blessings that a saint is promised,
you've got all of them.

00:28:16.059 --> 00:28:22.560
But because you've got them, you don't understand.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.039
You take it for granted.

00:28:24.039 --> 00:28:27.049
There's no shraddha.

00:28:27.049 --> 00:28:35.760
With this experience there should be tremendous
faith.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:43.669
Faith is a thing that resides between Me and
you, in between.

00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:47.790
Is we can say, the ocean of joy that is in
between.

00:28:47.790 --> 00:29:00.049
Whatever I emit to you is that shraddha, and
when you are drenched into it, the joy of

00:29:00.049 --> 00:29:08.940
that shraddha makes everything so sahaj.

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:15.970
But for that you must open your hearts.

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:25.690
A Sahaja yogi who is secretive, who is insular,
who is jealous, who separates himself from

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:28.669
others is no good.

00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:31.720
Open your heart.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:37.820
Give away your things, doesn't matter.

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:44.289
Matter has only one value, that it can communicate
your Sahaj culture.

00:29:44.289 --> 00:29:59.370
Little things, you see, I see something that
you have got beautiful, and in My Mahamaya

00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:03.730
acting on Myself I say, "Oh, that's very beautiful."

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:12.770
and then they say, "Mother, You gave us this."

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:15.640
"Ah, sorry."

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:21.020
And then I feel very ashamed of Myself, that
this is not Sahaj culture, you see.

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:24.820
But the joy is so much that I can't help it
sometimes I say, "Oh, I - it's so beautiful,

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:26.080
this one."

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:30.220
"You gave us, Mother."

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:35.260
And the whole rapport and the whole feeling;
I feeling a little shy about it, and all,

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:42.590
they're so beautiful, so dramatic; so dramatic
it is, so poetic.

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:45.870
Only at that point I feel ashamed of Myself.

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:52.440
Of course to be human being you should be
ashamed of yourself sometimes.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.830
Otherwise the drama is not complete.

00:30:53.830 --> 00:31:00.490
So the whole thing is so beautiful and so
joyous.

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:05.600
But that gentleness towards others and yourself
should be there.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:11.820
Now if you become unhappy and serious, you
are very unkind to yourself and to others.

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:17.710
Anybody who is a serious person, sits with
a serious face, know that he is not a Sahaja

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:19.270
yogi at all.

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:22.659
They should be bubbling with laughter, joy
all the time.

00:31:22.659 --> 00:31:27.820
I cannot be serious for more than, I think,
five seconds perhaps.

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:30.230
I don't know.

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:34.630
I try, because lectures should be serious
to go into the hearts of the people.

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:41.500
But there's not, and you can see that even
when I'm getting angry, My eyes betray Me,

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:47.160
and there's a twinkle of laughter in the eyes.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:52.580
That's how a person should be, and don't worry
what others have to say.

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:58.929
You see, the culture where people are just
glum like this, is the same as the people

00:31:58.929 --> 00:32:00.350
where they are frivolous.

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:08.929
Now as we can say American culture is to be
frivolous, stupid, you see, I won't be surprised

00:32:08.929 --> 00:32:11.170
supposing your Prime Minister tomorrow starts
wearing a sari, just to amuse you.

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:20.809
Anything is possible with them, just to amuse
you, you see, too - for cheap popularity.

00:32:20.809 --> 00:32:22.950
Anything frivolous, stupid, they will do.

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:30.490
But supposing, you see, it is say an English
old conservative personality, then a lady

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:39.370
might wear a very official dress with the
lines and this and that, and like a man she

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:45.020
might become very soon, like that, develop
a very serious face.

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:48.830
But both things are nonsensical, has no meaning.

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:56.380
You have to be natural, and natural everything
is always bubbling with joy.

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:58.110
And a message.

00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:59.110
And a message.

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:06.970
These flowers are the message of My coming,
writ large on them.

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:14.200
So a person who is a Sahaj culture man should
emit that message to others, people should

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.039
see, "Oh, this is the man.

00:33:16.039 --> 00:33:18.570
He is the sahaja fellow."

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:19.570
You can see that clearly.

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:21.120
There's no seriousness, there's no unhappiness,
nothing.

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:27.200
Supposing I have said something that might
be upsetting you, forget it.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:33.580
If you cannot forget that, then you have not
listened to Me.

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:36.510
But "forget" doesn't mean that you do not
act upon it.

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:42.419
"Acting upon it" means that you face yourself
and see for yourself how you have ascended

00:33:42.419 --> 00:33:45.620
and how far you have to go, not how you'll
fall down.

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:51.380
So it is all the time acting on both sides,
as I'm telling you in My lecture, that on

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:57.690
one side you'll see to yourself as relationship
with Me, and relationship with others.

00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:11.310
For a Sahaja yogi it should not matter whether
you are in a palace or on the street.

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:15.299
The first encounter with the first Sahaja
yogis - we have only one surviving, now here

00:34:15.299 --> 00:34:22.809
sitting down - they couldn't bear, for them
it was difficult to be in the beautiful atmosphere

00:34:22.809 --> 00:34:23.809
of India.

00:34:23.809 --> 00:34:29.760
The reason is, they were analyzing: they have
no good bathrooms, no showers.

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:33.159
But you have the whole sky.

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:35.799
You have all the mountains.

00:34:35.799 --> 00:34:37.119
You have all the trees.

00:34:37.119 --> 00:34:40.129
You have got all the waters flowing.

00:34:40.129 --> 00:34:46.879
But you want to have a little shower, in which
you can't even move.

00:34:46.879 --> 00:34:53.559
Just an idea, just an idea of comfort.

00:34:53.559 --> 00:34:59.480
You have no comforts, if you ask Me, compared
to what we have in India.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.109
No comforts at all.

00:35:01.109 --> 00:35:07.229
I mean, ask any Indian girl to come and stay,
she will cry.

00:35:07.229 --> 00:35:13.219
Even I think here the President, the President
has to wash his utensils perhaps, maybe.

00:35:13.219 --> 00:35:15.380
What a comfort.

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:18.999
There's no division of labor.

00:35:18.999 --> 00:35:23.700
Now in our country we have servants, but "servants"
doesn't mean that we cheat them anything else.

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:26.319
They eat the same food as we eat.

00:35:26.319 --> 00:35:28.200
They live the same way we live.

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:32.180
But they do different type of work, because
they don't have the same mental capacity to

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:34.440
be the President.

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:39.069
The President does some other work.

00:35:39.069 --> 00:35:42.440
You have no comfort of any kind, you take
it from Me.

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:45.490
Food matter, you get everything processed
food.

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:50.489
Imagine, any time you might be developing
cancer due to processed food.

00:35:50.489 --> 00:35:53.099
What is your speciality then?

00:35:53.099 --> 00:35:54.839
Try to understand.

00:35:54.839 --> 00:36:00.000
What is the kind of food: it's not fresh,
God knows how it is processed, how it is preserved,

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.089
from where it is coming.

00:36:01.089 --> 00:36:07.180
Suddenly in London they said that, "Don't
eat this kind of food," you see, "because

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:09.529
it has got something contaminated."

00:36:09.529 --> 00:36:13.920
So everybody rushes, you see, to the store
room, because we have to store up all these

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:14.920
things.

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:15.920
You can't get at the right….

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:19.440
"Oh it's there"; then you start throwing them
out.

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:29.480
It's a mad racing because people think that,
"God knows what we are eating today, is it

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.670
correct or not?"

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:34.509
So food-wise you are zero.

00:36:34.509 --> 00:36:41.490
Best thing is to live in the villages or in
the forests, to get the fresh fruits, wash

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:51.529
them in clean flowing water of a river, eat
it nicely and sit down enjoying the sun.

00:36:51.529 --> 00:36:58.420
The comfort of the spirit is the thing we
have lost, and those who seek the comfort

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:04.349
of the spirit are Sahaja yogis, not otherwise.

00:37:04.349 --> 00:37:08.249
Comfort of the spirit comes in giving.

00:37:08.249 --> 00:37:15.529
Say I've borrowed some money from you, I won't
be comfortable till I've paid you back.

00:37:15.529 --> 00:37:22.059
Going further with it, supposing you are caught
up into something, you have got some problems.

00:37:22.059 --> 00:37:26.730
I'll somehow or other manage that you'll come
close to Me somewhere, and work it out on

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:28.440
you, clear you out, finished.

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:33.499
Till then I won't be comfortable; though I'll
suffer, I'll have pains, I'll have this, that.

00:37:33.499 --> 00:37:37.299
As soon as I came here, left Nabhi was like
this going on.

00:37:37.299 --> 00:37:38.299
Corrected it.

00:37:38.299 --> 00:37:41.640
I took it upon Myself, I sucked it into Me.

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:44.930
So they are adventurous.

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:50.329
"Oh I will not touch, I am catching, he's
catching."

00:37:50.329 --> 00:37:51.329
Finished.

00:37:51.329 --> 00:37:55.920
But now the compassion can only work out if
you have that kind of a spirit, otherwise

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.069
you cannot.

00:37:57.069 --> 00:37:58.789
It becomes sympathy.

00:37:58.789 --> 00:38:04.410
For example there's one person, Mr. A. or
Miss A. or Mrs. A., whatever it is.

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:09.839
I mean, I'm just talking of a common personality,
and that person is catching.

00:38:09.839 --> 00:38:13.800
I would say in an ashram, that person should
clear out.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:19.099
But all the ashramites will catch from that
person, and that person will never be all

00:38:19.099 --> 00:38:20.369
right.

00:38:20.369 --> 00:38:23.210
There's a very nice joke about it.

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:26.690
There was a lady, she wanted to reduce herself.

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:29.029
So there was a machine like a rolling-pin.

00:38:29.029 --> 00:38:33.099
They said, "If you rub it, then you will reduce."

00:38:33.099 --> 00:38:37.849
So she brought, poor thing, she brought the
machine and she started rolling it.

00:38:37.849 --> 00:38:48.709
She found that the rolling-pin became fat,
instead of she reducing.

00:38:48.709 --> 00:38:53.059
Same thing is in Sahaja yoga.

00:38:53.059 --> 00:38:56.319
Instead of Sahaja yogis correcting the others,
they get contaminated.

00:38:56.319 --> 00:38:58.160
That's why I said, "Don't have anybody in
the ashram."

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:01.849
Because you sympathize.

00:39:01.849 --> 00:39:07.029
You do not try to correct that person, in
a way that you can correct within yourselves,

00:39:07.029 --> 00:39:09.489
suck it within yourself as your Mother does,
and do it.

00:39:09.489 --> 00:39:14.660
I do it for thousands and thousands and thousands;
you have to do it for one or two, so you are

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:15.660
never bothered.

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:17.269
And that's how you become strong.

00:39:17.269 --> 00:39:21.709
Not by shunning them, running away from them
or condemning yourself, or saying that: "We

00:39:21.709 --> 00:39:26.029
must save ourselves on the boat."

00:39:26.029 --> 00:39:27.029
No.

00:39:27.029 --> 00:39:28.490
Through adventure.

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:30.380
"Let's see what happens".

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:33.229
Tamara was telling Me, "Nothing catches me,
Mother, what is it?"

00:39:33.229 --> 00:39:35.859
I said: "But who will catch you?

00:39:35.859 --> 00:39:41.549
Those who will catch will be hurt themselves."

00:39:41.549 --> 00:39:45.030
So what is it, that Bhairava is to be established.

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:51.750
Sidha kala mane Bhairav' - as you have to
establish Shri Ganesha, you have to establish

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:54.509
also Bhairava, and Hanumana on the right side.

00:39:54.509 --> 00:40:00.440
If these three deities you establish within
yourself, nothing, nothing on this earth can

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.440
catch you.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:05.000
You'll catch it for a while.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.709
But what I find now, I came to this ashram,
everybody's left Nabhi caught up.

00:40:08.709 --> 00:40:13.249
Everybody's left Agnya caught up.

00:40:13.249 --> 00:40:14.789
So then I get the pain.

00:40:14.789 --> 00:40:15.789
Everyone.

00:40:15.789 --> 00:40:18.650
I mean, I have put you inside My body, do
you know that?

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:24.359
You are part and parcel of My body, you are
the cells in My body.

00:40:24.359 --> 00:40:33.239
And when you catch, I also catch; not catch,
but I really get the pain, but I clear it.

00:40:33.239 --> 00:40:36.170
In the same way, I have given you powers.

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:43.690
Every power I have, I have given you.

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:51.089
But you have to develop it and you have to
be adventurous.

00:40:51.089 --> 00:40:56.449
But on the contrary, once we have ashrams,
everybody settles down, "Oh, now, very comfortable,

00:40:56.449 --> 00:40:57.449
very cheap."

00:40:57.449 --> 00:41:00.630
Very economical, that's the first comfort.

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:11.140
It's surprising, for a Western person, it
is very important that it should be economical,

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:19.509
surprising, affluent people think more of
saving money than the people who are poor.

00:41:19.509 --> 00:41:28.759
And English are the last word, save pounds,
at the cost of others.

00:41:28.759 --> 00:41:32.440
On the contrary if you go to India, where
they’ll be very happy, they'll invite you

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.680
in their house.

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:37.279
Whatever they have they will give it to you,
"Eat, eat, eat."

00:41:37.279 --> 00:41:38.279
They'll force you.

00:41:38.279 --> 00:41:40.029
They'll be very happy to give.

00:41:40.029 --> 00:41:43.630
But in England it's very dangerous, you see.

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:47.049
Sometimes in the ashram they may not even
have food for Me.

00:41:47.049 --> 00:41:48.739
Really.

00:41:48.739 --> 00:41:51.479
And if you tell them, "I know.

00:41:51.479 --> 00:41:52.479
I know."

00:41:52.479 --> 00:41:53.479
You know.

00:41:53.479 --> 00:41:54.479
Finished.

00:41:54.479 --> 00:41:55.479
Then what do you say?

00:41:55.479 --> 00:41:57.029
They already know it, now what to do?

00:41:57.029 --> 00:41:58.160
They know.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:06.329
So with the affluence miserliness grows, and
money-orientation.

00:42:06.329 --> 00:42:11.749
In India also I've seen people who get little
more money than the rest become very money-oriented.

00:42:11.749 --> 00:42:16.619
Money becomes everything, money becomes the
power, money becomes their life.

00:42:16.619 --> 00:42:20.420
Sahaja yogi doesn't care for money.

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:25.509
Just.. is the dust of our Mother's feet.

00:42:25.509 --> 00:42:28.470
What is money, what is wealth?

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:33.750
And when they do like that, then their money
problems are solved.

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:36.699
If you have a money problem, know that there's
a problem.

00:42:36.699 --> 00:42:42.729
If you are very particular about money.

00:42:42.729 --> 00:42:47.349
I am, in a way, because if I have to give
somebody, I remember it.

00:42:47.349 --> 00:42:51.329
But I've seen people who are very anxious
to tell Me that, "You have to pay this man

00:42:51.329 --> 00:42:52.329
so much, that man so much."

00:42:52.329 --> 00:42:53.329
That's wrong.

00:42:53.329 --> 00:42:55.670
That's not your look-out.

00:42:55.670 --> 00:43:00.869
That's very, very wrong to tell Me that, "You
have to pay this man or that man."

00:43:00.869 --> 00:43:02.730
It's not important.

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:06.479
Even if I don't pay, I pay him.

00:43:06.479 --> 00:43:12.400
So in relationship with Me, you are not to
tell Me that, "You have to pay so much money

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:16.460
to him, this much money should be paid, this
is what he owes You."

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:17.539
Nothing of the kind.

00:43:17.539 --> 00:43:20.059
Let the person come and tell Me.

00:43:20.059 --> 00:43:21.410
Why are you telling?

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:26.069
That kind of a message if you give Me, you
are lost.

00:43:26.069 --> 00:43:31.460
Or if you come and tell Me for somebody else
that, "Mother, time is up, we have to go.

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:33.709
Somebody is hurrying You up."

00:43:33.709 --> 00:43:40.069
If somebody is hurrying Me, tell him, "Don't
hurry Mother."

00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:52.099
You must know that your kundalinis were not
raised with just your own kundalini, but something

00:43:52.099 --> 00:43:53.869
that is working it out.

00:43:53.869 --> 00:43:58.730
Something very tremendous, a big organization.

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:02.619
You can't see it, it is microscopic.

00:44:02.619 --> 00:44:06.799
You must know, nobody got realization like
that, did they?

00:44:06.799 --> 00:44:08.999
Thousands getting realization, what's happening?

00:44:08.999 --> 00:44:11.369
There must be something about…

00:44:11.369 --> 00:44:16.589
Now how can you tell anything to such an organization?

00:44:16.589 --> 00:44:17.589
They don't like it.

00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:19.009
They know it.

00:44:19.009 --> 00:44:23.020
Actually they are the ones who know, not the
English.

00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:26.019
They know what is to be done.

00:44:26.019 --> 00:44:32.849
So your relationship with Me acts as your
culture.

00:44:32.849 --> 00:44:39.299
So it is a Mother's cult, you can call it,
the Mother's culture.

00:44:39.299 --> 00:44:41.961
How we are connected with our Mother.

00:44:41.961 --> 00:44:48.759
I have seen people, if somebody is rude to
them, they get very angry.

00:44:48.759 --> 00:44:52.170
But if somebody is rude to Me they don't feel
angry.

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:56.220
It should be the other way round.

00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:59.380
Now I'll give you an example.

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:05.779
This Merv Griffin was funny, and both our
PRO’s were very angry.

00:45:05.779 --> 00:45:07.479
It was natural and very…

00:45:07.479 --> 00:45:10.619
I mean, I liked it, but I calmed them down.

00:45:10.619 --> 00:45:12.769
And Worlikar of course was on top of this
thing.

00:45:12.769 --> 00:45:15.740
But the other fellow would not.

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:19.009
He was giving arguments.

00:45:19.009 --> 00:45:20.539
I was just watching.

00:45:20.539 --> 00:45:24.170
I mean, if somebody had said this to his mother...

00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:32.220
There's another one there, he never came to
receive Me at the airport.

00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:42.599
So Worlikar said, "If your own mother had
come, you would not have gone?"

00:45:42.599 --> 00:45:46.519
Then one can give explanation, "Oh, but our
Mother is Adi Shakti.

00:45:46.519 --> 00:45:48.739
My mother is not, she's helpless."

00:45:48.739 --> 00:45:49.739
It's not.

00:45:49.739 --> 00:45:54.880
To show your respect, to show your love, you
have to go; for your own gain, not for Her

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:55.880
gain.

00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:59.549
For your own gain.

00:45:59.549 --> 00:46:03.190
This relationship is for your own gain.

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:12.809
Supposing if you strike oil, is it for your
gain or for the gain of the oil?

00:46:12.809 --> 00:46:19.369
If you get to the Source, is it for the Source
to gain anything, or it is for you to gain

00:46:19.369 --> 00:46:20.369
anything?

00:46:20.369 --> 00:46:23.150
Logic, simple logic.

00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:32.309
So in that culture, you see, you really thrive
and you become extremely a happy person, a

00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:34.829
joyous person.

00:46:34.829 --> 00:46:44.170
And the expression of such a person is so
different, because such a person, as I told

00:46:44.170 --> 00:46:50.949
you, rises above and sees the problems of
others, the decadence of the society, sees

00:46:50.949 --> 00:46:56.259
all the problems of the world.

00:46:56.259 --> 00:47:00.000
Not only that, but knows the solutions.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:09.809
We are not like these ordinary people who
have racialism, this.. other diseases, I don't

00:47:09.809 --> 00:47:12.760
know what sort of diseases they have, I also
forget.

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:15.490
Racialism now, it's another stupid nonsense,
you know.

00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:17.029
What is racialism?

00:47:17.029 --> 00:47:22.599
God has made somebody's color like this and
somebody's color like that, and those same

00:47:22.599 --> 00:47:34.150
racists are trying to tan their faces.

00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:41.079
So in this culture of ours we are not bothered
about superficial things.

00:47:41.079 --> 00:47:50.059
What we are bothered about is our inner cleanliness,
inner beauty, but that doesn't mean that you

00:47:50.059 --> 00:47:55.859
should move about like primitive people, no.

00:47:55.859 --> 00:47:58.880
But if there is inner beauty, then outer beauty
comes.

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:01.459
You will never find Me dirtily dressed.

00:48:01.459 --> 00:48:07.079
You will never find Me without a sari on,
even when I sleep I wear a sari, because in

00:48:07.079 --> 00:48:18.160
the night also I have to work, so how can
I go in My dressing-gown to the other world?

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:25.359
So a person who is a Sahaja yogi has to be
an extremely neat and a clean person, but

00:48:25.359 --> 00:48:28.989
not to tell others, but should be himself
or herself.

00:48:28.989 --> 00:48:33.769
That's one of the things are very important,
because others will see you, like loonies,

00:48:33.769 --> 00:48:36.119
who's going to believe you?

00:48:36.119 --> 00:48:42.329
So the one effect is from the Mother, you
take from the Source, for what?

00:48:42.329 --> 00:48:51.180
To be that illuminated quality, in you, so
that others see you as something great and

00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:55.229
adore you, worship you.

00:48:55.229 --> 00:49:00.319
This is this far we have come, now, how your
personality should be.

00:49:00.319 --> 00:49:06.259
But now, when you are dealing with others,
know that they are human beings made by God,

00:49:06.259 --> 00:49:11.349
not by Sahaja yogis by any chance.

00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:16.200
And they will be tomorrow's Sahaja yogis,
may be higher Sahaja yogis than you.

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:23.049
So when we are dealing with others also, talk
to them in a gentle way.

00:49:23.049 --> 00:49:24.069
Be kind to them.

00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:27.940
Of course we are against gurus, against cults,
against all these people.

00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:35.479
But as soon as they come, if you say: "Oh,
you are a bhoot", the person will do right-about-turn

00:49:35.479 --> 00:49:39.369
and go away.

00:49:39.369 --> 00:49:50.150
So you are not given this power to be abrupt
or to be arrogant with others, not given.

00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:57.859
Now all such people are coming down, calming
down because they see that what helps is your

00:49:57.859 --> 00:50:02.630
gentle, kindly, firm attitude.

00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:05.609
Only after Sahaja Yoga you can combine all
these qualities.

00:50:05.609 --> 00:50:14.559
You'll be firm, you'll be alert, you'll be
gentle and compassionate, smiling, but not

00:50:14.559 --> 00:50:16.359
making fun of others.

00:50:16.359 --> 00:50:26.359
So then you become a personality who is alert:
to see what is the reaction they're having

00:50:26.359 --> 00:50:29.319
on others, this is very important to be seen.

00:50:29.319 --> 00:50:32.689
So now you start witnessing others.

00:50:32.689 --> 00:50:34.839
What is your reaction on others?

00:50:34.839 --> 00:50:40.459
I have seen many a times, a new Sahaja yogi
comes in.

00:50:40.459 --> 00:50:47.529
The person is trying to say something, and
the girl starts giggling or laughing.

00:50:47.529 --> 00:50:52.420
One should not, at that time, because the
person might think that, "They're making fool

00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:57.650
of me, or they're thinking that I'm a stupid
person, or something wrong with me."

00:50:57.650 --> 00:51:01.449
That person will become self-conscious, I
won't be able to give realization to that

00:51:01.449 --> 00:51:02.609
person.

00:51:02.609 --> 00:51:09.599
But if somebody is sitting before Me and I'm
trying to help that person, know that it's

00:51:09.599 --> 00:51:16.109
a very important moment of this gentleman's
life.

00:51:16.109 --> 00:51:18.170
We have got it, so what?

00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:25.259
When we are pulling out somebody, when we
are helping out somebody, do we laugh?

00:51:25.259 --> 00:51:34.170
That's the time you have to be very concerned
and very much serious, to do the job.

00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:39.579
Every quality and mood has its own place,
like nose is at its own place, eyes at its

00:51:39.579 --> 00:51:40.579
own place.

00:51:40.579 --> 00:51:50.279
In the same way, all these moods that we have,
have their own places.

00:51:50.279 --> 00:51:55.979
And that is what is lost in modern society.

00:51:55.979 --> 00:52:03.099
So when I am trying to help somebody, you
should be all concern about that person.

00:52:03.099 --> 00:52:06.779
How does this come in to us from the Source?

00:52:06.779 --> 00:52:09.910
How much you are concerned about Me?

00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:16.449
Supposing I am thirsty, you will feel thirsty.

00:52:16.449 --> 00:52:19.150
You'll immediately say, "Mother, I'll get
You some water."

00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:23.219
But you may not even ask Me, just bring it
here, keep it there.

00:52:23.219 --> 00:52:26.180
Or just make some tea for Me or look after
Me.

00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:29.589
Do this or do that.

00:52:29.589 --> 00:52:32.769
In little, little things you should watch.

00:52:32.769 --> 00:52:36.410
The concern is not in saying something, asking
something.

00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:37.880
You don't ask.

00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:47.249
Don't ask Mother, you just do it.

00:52:47.249 --> 00:52:51.609
That's how, when you start doing it, you will
understand what you are doing to others.

00:52:51.609 --> 00:52:59.401
So the reflection on others, how they reflect
about you also is very important, and you

00:52:59.401 --> 00:53:03.449
have to be alert.

00:53:03.449 --> 00:53:06.489
Suddenly you say something, and everybody
disappears.

00:53:06.489 --> 00:53:10.460
You must know they are not yet Sahaja yogis,
they are to be brought in, so you have to

00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:16.790
very carefully bring them around.

00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:23.809
Then with Sahaja yogis, among yourselves how
you behave is extremely important for others

00:53:23.809 --> 00:53:25.769
to see.

00:53:25.769 --> 00:53:33.660
We must cherish each other's company, we must
cherish.

00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:38.450
To meet some Sahaja yogi somewhere, "Ah, what
a joy it is to see someone, to talk to someone

00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:39.729
on the phone."

00:53:39.729 --> 00:53:46.900
But because we are so insular, so selfish,
so greedy, and sometimes very circumcised

00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:55.779
[should read 'circumscribed'] I should say,
or absolutely engulfed into our past, we cannot

00:53:55.779 --> 00:54:02.479
do that, we do not feel that joy, we cannot
adore another Sahaja yogi, we do not enjoy

00:54:02.479 --> 00:54:08.069
another Sahaja yogi, we cannot cherish his
company.

00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:12.839
That means this finger cannot feel this finger.

00:54:12.839 --> 00:54:17.790
It's like a developing, what you call, a disease
called leprosy.

00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:20.400
Nerves are finished.

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:22.789
Nerve endings are not there.

00:54:22.789 --> 00:54:31.739
You cannot feel the joy of other Sahaja yogis.

00:54:31.739 --> 00:54:38.660
And this is only possible if you get over
your personal interests.

00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:46.859
When people come in Sahaja Yoga in the beginning,
they have personal interests, like say somebody

00:54:46.859 --> 00:54:54.089
is trying to sell something, so they would
like to sell it to Sahaja yogis.

00:54:54.089 --> 00:54:58.680
Or they are arranging something, they would
like Sahaja yogis to do it.

00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:02.630
See, personal interest, to use Sahaja yogis
for their own purposes.

00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:11.499
As a result of that I've seen some people
become so insular that nobody helps them,

00:55:11.499 --> 00:55:15.819
no work is done by them; if there's a telephone,
nobody will say, "I'll get it."

00:55:15.819 --> 00:55:18.609
That's American quality, they'll say, "I'll
get it."

00:55:18.609 --> 00:55:20.380
Is regarded good.

00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:27.049
Not in England, they'll be all sitting, quiet.

00:55:27.049 --> 00:55:32.239
Even when they have eaten the food, they have
to pay the money, they'll look this side,

00:55:32.239 --> 00:55:36.739
and some poor Indian student will pay for
all of them.

00:55:36.739 --> 00:55:38.279
"I won't look", they say.

00:55:38.279 --> 00:55:39.279
"Now paid."

00:55:39.279 --> 00:55:40.559
Now they are normal.

00:55:40.559 --> 00:55:44.749
It's very low-level.

00:55:44.749 --> 00:55:50.349
Is extremely low-level behavior.

00:55:50.349 --> 00:56:02.059
And this is what one has to learn, that you
have to cherish others, give presents to others.

00:56:02.059 --> 00:56:11.049
"You're going there; “Oh, now…"; like
the other day I met a lady, she had liked

00:56:11.049 --> 00:56:15.759
one of My rings of emerald.

00:56:15.759 --> 00:56:22.219
That's My family ring so I can't give away,
you see, I'll have to ask C.P. and he may

00:56:22.219 --> 00:56:27.099
not like it, because after all I have no right
on it, I have to give it to My children, all

00:56:27.099 --> 00:56:28.099
right?

00:56:28.099 --> 00:56:32.189
But I found an emerald somewhere, beautiful,
so I kept it with Me.

00:56:32.189 --> 00:56:34.349
The other day when I gave her, she was so
enamored.

00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:38.179
I said, "You liked My ring, I couldn't give
you My ring, so.."

00:56:38.179 --> 00:56:41.699
She said to Me, "You mean to say, I would
have taken Your ring?"

00:56:41.699 --> 00:56:46.009
I said, "I would have forced it on you, but
I couldn't give you, so I thought of it.

00:56:46.009 --> 00:56:48.880
I just saw it somewhere so I got it for you."

00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:49.880
She said, "How thoughtful."

00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:53.209
But it's all in My head.

00:56:53.209 --> 00:57:02.719
I, whenever I get it, a chance, you see, so
somebody says, "Oh, I like it", keep it in

00:57:02.719 --> 00:57:03.719
mind.

00:57:03.719 --> 00:57:06.709
Next time, even a flower.

00:57:06.709 --> 00:57:11.599
You must cherish their companies, because
it's such a great thing to have somebody who

00:57:11.599 --> 00:57:14.890
understands you, your spirit, and they have
the spirit.

00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:16.630
Such a great thing.

00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:21.829
How can you be unkind to each other?

00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:24.009
That hurts Me the most of all.

00:57:24.009 --> 00:57:33.490
And the first thing and the foremost thing
you have to give Me is congenial, beautiful,

00:57:33.490 --> 00:57:41.880
loving group, that they love each other.

00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:46.199
If that's achieved, that you really love,
beyond your personal considerations.

00:57:46.199 --> 00:57:53.729
I mean, of course, in Sahaja Yoga there are
now not many people who try to make money,

00:57:53.729 --> 00:57:55.859
but try to make comfort for themselves.

00:57:55.859 --> 00:57:59.319
They must have the best room, they must have
the best place, they must have...

00:57:59.319 --> 00:58:02.420
"I didn't get this, I should have it, this,
that."

00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:03.789
Try to do more than others.

00:58:03.789 --> 00:58:09.980
I know sometimes people take advantage of
you, but they will go out of Sahaja Yoga very

00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:10.980
soon.

00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:15.420
So be sure that you become generous about
it, very generous.

00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:26.880
And generosity should start from your own
Sahaja yogi brothers and sisters.

00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:36.229
In the culture of Sahaja Yoga we have to have
a full imbibement bubbling through our nerves,

00:58:36.229 --> 00:58:40.130
the sense of chastity.

00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:45.799
That is a must, whether you like it or not.

00:58:45.799 --> 00:58:57.640
There should be no bad intentions about any
other person, of relationships which are not

00:58:57.640 --> 00:58:58.640
pure.

00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:11.059
Absolutely pure relationships, pure eyes without
any adultery, adulteration I would call it.

00:59:11.059 --> 00:59:20.640
Clean eyes is the basic of Sahaja Yoga.

00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:27.489
Steadfast clean eyes, because your eyes are
very powerful.

00:59:27.489 --> 00:59:32.989
You don't know how powerful they are.

00:59:32.989 --> 00:59:44.670
So to make it that way, to practice, move
your attention inward and towards the Sahasrara.

00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:45.670
You can.

00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:50.219
With your eyes you suck in.

00:59:50.219 --> 00:59:57.549
Even by looking at Me with the shraddha, with
the joy, you just suck it inside, My image.

00:59:57.549 --> 01:00:05.420
Put it on your Sahasrara, put it in your heart,
you can do it.

01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:07.719
It's very joy giving.

01:00:07.719 --> 01:00:13.509
When you put it in the Sahasrara, then you
get the knowledge.

01:00:13.509 --> 01:00:20.699
When you put it in your heart, you get the
joy; and when you put it on your liver, then

01:00:20.699 --> 01:00:26.049
you get the power of action.

01:00:26.049 --> 01:00:32.289
From the photograph also you can do it, suck
in, move it.

01:00:32.289 --> 01:00:43.249
But that is shown in the way you behave towards
others, completely confident, gentle; no arrogance.

01:00:43.249 --> 01:00:55.969
Neither the neck up like that or like that,
but in the center in a very dignified manner.

01:00:55.969 --> 01:01:10.319
So in the culture of Sahaj, because the spirit
is the dignity, is the majesty, is the glory

01:01:10.319 --> 01:01:14.019
of God, you have to judge yourself.

01:01:14.019 --> 01:01:20.329
"Did I say something which is not respecting
my spirit?

01:01:20.329 --> 01:01:27.209
Did I do something that is not glorious?"

01:01:27.209 --> 01:01:31.489
Like I've seen people, when I'm there, they'll
go on asking Me hundred questions.

01:01:31.489 --> 01:01:33.529
"Should it be white towel?

01:01:33.529 --> 01:01:34.529
Green towel?

01:01:34.529 --> 01:01:39.339
Should I do this, should I do that?"

01:01:39.339 --> 01:01:40.739
Why?

01:01:40.739 --> 01:01:42.979
Because we don't live with choices.

01:01:42.979 --> 01:01:48.039
We live with whatever we get it, and there
is dignity in that.

01:01:48.039 --> 01:01:54.469
If you start doing choices, it's stupid.

01:01:54.469 --> 01:01:59.220
In a group of Sahaja yogis, the food, "What
will you have?"

01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:03.339
They'll take forty-five minutes to decide,
if you go in a restaurant, because the first,

01:02:03.339 --> 01:02:08.119
the consciousness, "We are paying for it",
and somebody will have this, somebody will

01:02:08.119 --> 01:02:09.119
have that.

01:02:09.119 --> 01:02:11.459
The poor waiter will run away.

01:02:11.459 --> 01:02:14.630
But why should we have different?

01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:18.940
It's just the same.

01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:26.349
Whatever Mother is having we'll have, finished.

01:02:26.349 --> 01:02:29.699
But if not that, at least whatever everybody
is having, "Why have separately?"

01:02:29.699 --> 01:02:34.150
Choices are not there in Sahaja Yoga, remember
this word very clearly.

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:37.900
Choices of this, choices of that, I don't
like it, I like that.

01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:42.670
This is not good, that is not good.

01:02:42.670 --> 01:02:50.789
Because we need everything on the level of
vibrations, then the choice is coming.

01:02:50.789 --> 01:03:00.549
Like, if the vibrations are not good we'll
not say it, but we'll not have it.

01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:05.559
But not question of whether green or red or
yellow or white.

01:03:05.559 --> 01:03:09.440
And that is what they are making fool out
of you.

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:15.079
They will put one name, Cartier, finished.

01:03:15.079 --> 01:03:18.609
People will pay any amount for that Cartier.

01:03:18.609 --> 01:03:23.959
Is any ordinary stuff, it is nothing special.

01:03:23.959 --> 01:03:26.059
But you see that ego, "I've got the Cartier.

01:03:26.059 --> 01:03:31.329
I paid more to show that I've paid more, that
I've been a fool."

01:03:31.329 --> 01:03:39.459
To pay more for something that's so cheapish;
that's what they're playing upon - remember

01:03:39.459 --> 01:03:40.459
that.

01:03:40.459 --> 01:03:48.589
So you have to understand that when you are
a Sahaj personality, you have your own dignity.

01:03:48.589 --> 01:03:51.980
These things do not give dignity to you.

01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:58.420
You give them dignity.

01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:07.369
But that doesn't mean tomorrow you come like
a clown, or like a limbo on your nose.

01:04:07.369 --> 01:04:12.890
Of course I must see the other point always,
because it just slips out that side.

01:04:12.890 --> 01:04:20.250
When you become dignified, you will wear always
something that is dignified.

01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:22.039
You will do all that is dignified.

01:04:22.039 --> 01:04:24.700
Is automatically you become dignified.

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:28.089
It's nothing artificial.

01:04:28.089 --> 01:04:35.709
So dignity that comes, as you see your Mother.

01:04:35.709 --> 01:04:42.039
Whatever you give Me in Puja I take it, all
right, but otherwise you cannot give Me anything

01:04:42.039 --> 01:04:43.039
else.

01:04:43.039 --> 01:04:49.279
If you give Me, I'll return it, somehow.

01:04:49.279 --> 01:04:52.489
Somehow I'll return it.

01:04:52.489 --> 01:04:58.920
A person who is money-oriented cannot have
dignity, because you see him like a beggar.

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:02.040
See, if there’s money-orientation is too
much, he comes down to that level, you can

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:04.510
see it, there cannot be dignity there.

01:05:04.510 --> 01:05:09.009
A man who is power-oriented is an idiot.

01:05:09.009 --> 01:05:11.700
He looks like an idiot.

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:13.169
So we cannot become idiots.

01:05:13.169 --> 01:05:14.169
All right.

01:05:14.169 --> 01:05:16.779
So we cannot be power-oriented.

01:05:16.779 --> 01:05:24.970
The one who is sort of a romantic or a love-oriented,
is a stupid fellow.

01:05:24.970 --> 01:05:27.259
He behaves like a stupid fellow.

01:05:27.259 --> 01:05:30.599
On the street they go on kissing each other
all the time.

01:05:30.599 --> 01:05:32.160
"Where are you going?"

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:39.079
"To the divorce case, but last bit we are
thinking of having some kisses."

01:05:39.079 --> 01:05:42.970
Self-respect is the thing.

01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:44.369
Self is your spirit.

01:05:44.369 --> 01:05:47.589
The respect of the spirit should give you
that dignity.

01:05:47.589 --> 01:05:53.709
But in privacy you are gentle with your husband,
you are gentle with your wife.

01:05:53.709 --> 01:06:00.949
You must learn how to be gentle with her in
privacy, not in public.

01:06:00.949 --> 01:06:02.669
That's horrible.

01:06:02.669 --> 01:06:03.829
Specially in India.

01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:07.650
I am told that people go round with that romanticism
and all that.

01:06:07.650 --> 01:06:13.989
So please, don't do all those romantic stuff
in India, it's very embarrassing for Me, very

01:06:13.989 --> 01:06:15.140
embarrassing.

01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:20.140
So we cannot do things which embarrasses our
Mother.

01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:24.919
Once you start knowing that, "This will embarrass
Mother, we can't do this", automatically you

01:06:24.919 --> 01:06:25.919
are helping.

01:06:25.919 --> 01:06:32.400
So when it is related with Me, immediately,
"What will Mother think of in me?

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.519
Is this the way to behave towards Mother?"

01:06:34.519 --> 01:06:46.269
Immediately you will get the reward, as that
thing working through you, as if you become

01:06:46.269 --> 01:06:47.390
that nature.

01:06:47.390 --> 01:06:50.789
Sahaja culture is a sahaja nature.

01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:53.939
Automatically you will do it.

01:06:53.939 --> 01:07:00.910
You'll talk in that manner, you will speak
in that manner, you’ll live in that manner.

01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:07.190
I mean, I have seen people who have never
known Me, on a trunk call or a telephone,

01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:08.390
they recognize.

01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:13.219
They know I am something special; if they
are sensitive enough.

01:07:13.219 --> 01:07:17.759
From My photograph, the way I sit, the way
I talk, immediately everyone asks.

01:07:17.759 --> 01:07:21.589
The other day where I went for the meeting
with My husband, everybody was asking, "Who

01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:22.589
is this lady?"

01:07:22.589 --> 01:07:23.589
"Who is this lady?"

01:07:23.589 --> 01:07:27.660
"Who is this lady?"

01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:29.009
There's something in the personality.

01:07:29.009 --> 01:07:35.730
I talk to everyone nicely, I'm very sweet.

01:07:35.730 --> 01:07:39.309
We cannot be slavish, and we cannot enslave
anyone.

01:07:39.309 --> 01:07:47.280
We have to cherish, even human beings we have
to cherish, because they are us.

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:53.140
Not to despise anyone, not to laugh at anyone.

01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:59.720
In the culture of Sahaj, you have to become
an expert: expertise.

01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:07.599
Expertise comes through your adherence to
your Mother.

01:08:07.599 --> 01:08:12.279
Expertise: you all should be an expert, and
who will give you the certificate is your

01:08:12.279 --> 01:08:14.809
Mother only - who else?

01:08:14.809 --> 01:08:23.880
I may not say so, but your spirit will say
that, and not your ego.

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:30.159
In this short time whatever was possible,
it's such a big subject, culture is; you cannot.

01:08:30.159 --> 01:08:36.949
But I've talked to you, I would not say in
a very analytical way, but in a very synthetic

01:08:36.949 --> 01:08:39.119
manner.

01:08:39.119 --> 01:08:41.920
So I've given you very synthesis of the whole
thing.

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:48.779
"Analytical" would be one, two, three, four,
five - cut short - two, three, four, five,

01:08:48.779 --> 01:08:49.809
like that.

01:08:49.809 --> 01:08:51.889
It's not like that.

01:08:51.889 --> 01:08:54.250
And that is how you have to speak to people.

01:08:54.250 --> 01:08:59.199
One, this is so; two, this is so; three, this
is so; finished.

01:08:59.199 --> 01:09:01.099
You are not Sahaja yogis.

01:09:01.099 --> 01:09:08.230
In your speeches if you talk like that, finished.

01:09:08.230 --> 01:09:14.299
But before saying something or doing something,
give a little idea where you are leading the

01:09:14.299 --> 01:09:20.579
people, so they are not frittered away, attention
is not frittered away.

01:09:20.579 --> 01:09:32.469
Give a little idea, as I say, or else while
talking, bring them to a point which is important,

01:09:32.469 --> 01:09:38.350
so that they wait in the sentence to come
to that point.

01:09:38.350 --> 01:09:45.009
But make the whole sentence look so, that
it is going towards certain points, so always

01:09:45.009 --> 01:09:54.500
a Sahaja yogi must make a point out of what
they talk, not just babbling, talking.

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:58.489
What is the point you are going to make?

01:09:58.489 --> 01:10:04.000
Whatever they do, they have to know, "What
are we going to achieve out of it?"

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.179
Now, marriage.

01:10:05.179 --> 01:10:07.869
"What are we going to achieve out of marriage?"

01:10:07.869 --> 01:10:11.710
A family, house, everybody has, even a donkey
has that.

01:10:11.710 --> 01:10:13.849
What's so great?

01:10:13.849 --> 01:10:19.570
We are going to achieve a family unit where
realized souls are to be born, we're going

01:10:19.570 --> 01:10:31.340
to look after them in a proper way, and then
we are going to emit that unit into this world,

01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:39.179
like a sparkling diamond set in the beautiful
setting of a family, giving light to the whole

01:10:39.179 --> 01:10:42.219
world.

01:10:42.219 --> 01:10:52.480
So one's life should not be pointless, and
talk should not be pointless, and every moment

01:10:52.480 --> 01:11:03.369
should be filled with achievements of your
visions and dreams, slowly and steadily, which

01:11:03.369 --> 01:11:09.210
is not at all difficult.

01:11:09.210 --> 01:11:15.469
If you can get rid of ego and superego, finished,
that's all - simple as that.

01:11:15.469 --> 01:11:25.570
May God bless you all.

01:11:25.570 --> 01:11:35.659
Mm.. good.. nice.. relaxed, eh?

01:11:35.659 --> 01:11:37.679
Relaxed.

01:11:37.679 --> 01:11:39.699
Witness.

01:11:39.699 --> 01:11:49.250
Everyone cleared out, I think.

01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:50.250
And no more…

01:11:50.250 --> 01:11:56.409
one more thing I must say last, as I've said
it before, which I've not said here, no-one

01:11:56.409 --> 01:12:01.640
is going to say that bhoot did it, because
such a person will be sent away to the bhoot

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:05.030
clan, not to Sahaja Yoga.

01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:09.989
Don't put your responsibility on the bhoots.

01:12:09.989 --> 01:12:14.860
Either you are a bhoot or you are a Sahaja
yogi, one of the two, you can't be both.
