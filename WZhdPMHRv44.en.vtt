00:00:07.619 --> 00:00:12.780
So we have to give up our misidentifications with our previous styles of life,

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.935
previous type of living, previous type of executing any work

00:00:19.015 --> 00:00:22.790
and we have to understand that we are not to plan.

00:00:22.876 --> 00:00:29.865
This house is built for Me. I’m the power behind the whole universe,

00:00:29.945 --> 00:00:33.359
so you don’t have to plan, you just start off.

00:00:33.445 --> 00:00:39.917
But once you start planning then you depend 
on yourselves, which is a very limited thing.

00:00:39.997 --> 00:00:44.371
You just start planning and you are left behind.

00:00:44.451 --> 00:00:45.726
Just get to it.

00:00:45.806 --> 00:00:51.697
When you start thinking of any problems and all that, 
then you are lagging behind. Just start off

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:55.543
and everything will come forward, 
you’ll find everything it will all be there

00:00:55.623 --> 00:00:58.060
just before you, before your eyes.

00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:04.018
Like the other day they said we don’t find a wood 
we need very much of a particular thickness.

00:01:04.104 --> 00:01:09.851
And they were trying to sort of reduce 
the thickness by rubbing it

00:01:09.931 --> 00:01:17.426
with some very, very harsh type of noisy stuff, 
which nobody could bear.

00:01:17.512 --> 00:01:23.141
So, I just said, “What, what kind of a thing you want? See ahead of you.”

00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:27.043
And just in front of them was lying that same type of wood that they wanted.

00:01:27.128 --> 00:01:32.085
Just ahead of them. It was just there. You see how it’s happening? What’s working out?

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:34.958
It’s the Hanumana who works out many things for you.

00:01:35.038 --> 00:01:41.083
It is the Gauri who is to be adored. And it’s the duty 
of Hanumana to help you out. He plays tricks with you.

00:01:41.163 --> 00:01:45.709
Always, you see he is the one who makes you think, 
he makes you plan,

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.268
he makes you everything and then topples you down.

00:01:48.355 --> 00:01:54.242
You see, that is his style, always. 
And he has made mischief with so many people like that.

00:01:54.322 --> 00:02:00.394
You see, he made them think, plan, plan, plan, plan 
and ultimately they find all plans fail.

00:02:00.494 --> 00:02:04.118
So, if you are too organized, you’ll never enjoy.

00:02:04.198 --> 00:02:09.699
You have to enjoy each other’s company, 
you have to enjoy all little little things there are.

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:15.712
If there is everything perfect, or absolutely sort of a machine-like,

00:02:15.792 --> 00:02:19.400
when you go on tick-tick-tick-tick-finished, there’s no enjoyment.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.203
You have to lose your way somewhere. You have to find something out.

00:02:24.283 --> 00:02:27.548
You have to go about, you have to ask someone.

00:02:27.628 --> 00:02:31.774
Like making mistakes also is important. Sometimes if you make mistakes,

00:02:31.854 --> 00:02:36.462
like somebody makes mistake by putting the thing in an angular way,

00:02:36.542 --> 00:02:42.262
a decoration in an angular way, 
and it turned out to be a very beautiful thing, you see.

00:02:42.342 --> 00:02:46.652
So making mistakes is also good. 
This is what I’m trying to show to all of you.

00:02:46.732 --> 00:02:51.315
By mistake also, if you are driven to someplace 
you might find something very great.

00:02:51.315 --> 00:02:55.254
So, our time is never wasted. Wherever we are, we are.

00:02:55.334 --> 00:02:58.565
We are never lost. We are never lost for anything.

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:00.227
Time stops for us.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:07.411
So once you understand that we are not to worry 
about these things, which the people worry.

00:03:07.492 --> 00:03:13.235
We are not to worry about things for which people just give their lives.

00:03:13.315 --> 00:03:16.887
We are here for joy. And joy will come to us, whatever it is.

00:03:16.967 --> 00:03:22.668
So we should seek joy, happiness, friendship 
and this is a very, very good opportunity.
