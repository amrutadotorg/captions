00:14.549 --> 00:14.799
Try to Become Aware

00:14.559 --> 00:14.809
Shrirampur, India, 21 December 1989

00:14.570 --> 00:14.820
…. Backwards, those who haven’t got space
please move backwards. Be sensible. You all

00:14.619 --> 00:14.869
can see Me very well and those who are far
away are closer to Me; is a fact. When I say

00:14.759 --> 00:15.009
the truth, the Vishnumaya is there. Please
be seated. Hello. Uska kya naam? Jenny, you

00:14.759 --> 00:15.009
go that side. Don’t sit with men. Must keep
a discipline on yourself. Those who are sitting

00:14.759 --> 00:15.009
here please move to the left. Keep a distance.
Now, you are such great Sahaja Yogis, ancient

00:14.759 --> 00:15.009
Sahaja Yogis. People look forward to you for
discipline and sense. Mostly those who are

00:14.759 --> 00:15.009
very new try to come forward. I’ve seen
that. I can understand if you are a leader

00:14.759 --> 00:15.009
if you are sitting in front. But otherwise
what is the need to sit in front? Good. Please

00:14.759 --> 00:15.009
be seated. The further you are, you will feel
more vibrations. You can; for this you can

00:14.759 --> 00:15.009
testify. The closer you are you’ll feel
less. That’s My trick. [Hindi]

00:14.759 --> 00:15.009
Now see, are you feeling more vibrations there?
Jenny, there, see yourself. All right? I never

00:14.759 --> 00:15.009
tell lies. I’ll have some water. [Hindi]
No, no, why don’t you have a proper seat?

00:14.759 --> 00:16.420
[Hindi] You better have a seat. [Hindi] I’ve
been telling them about something which you

00:16.420 --> 00:23.420
need not know. I hope you didn’t understand.
Sometimes I have to speak in English when

00:27.960 --> 00:33.089
I want them not to know anything about you.
It’s quite mutual.

00:33.089 --> 00:40.089
All right, so I’m sorry for this delay but
it so happened that they never told Me anything.

00:40.129 --> 00:45.110
I didn’t know that is such a beautiful place
is here. Otherwise I would never have taken

00:45.110 --> 00:51.629
you down there for any problem because actually
this is the one that’s also a problem. God

00:51.629 --> 00:58.629
willing Me, we may buy this place. So I must
praise you for your patience and for your

01:19.550 --> 01:26.550
sweetness about it that delays do not matter
as long as we have the Pujas. I hope you all

01:28.479 --> 01:35.479
have rested very well and your stomach must
be also resting a little bit because you had

01:35.899 --> 01:42.280
a very severe type of an attack of people
who wanted to feed you and it was too much

01:42.280 --> 01:49.280
starting from Aurangabad to this place. This
is good once in a while to allow your stomach

01:49.890 --> 01:51.170
to rest.

01:51.170 --> 01:58.170
Now, I don’t know what to tell you because
as it is you know that we have big plans,

02:00.209 --> 02:06.810
when we, and when I say “we” I mean the
Paramchaitanya and all the deities put together,

02:06.810 --> 02:13.810
to expand Sahaja Yoga. It’s not necessary
how many things you give Me. It’s not necessary

02:13.980 --> 02:20.720
at all. It’s not necessary how many of us
are there. What's more important is how many

02:20.720 --> 02:27.720
people you give realization to. And secondly,
how are you? Have you evolved? Have you really

02:31.870 --> 02:38.870
become independent and you can get rid of
all your conditionings, your ego? And have

02:40.640 --> 02:47.640
you become a very mild, beautiful, compassionate,
collective personality? So it’s a question

02:48.560 --> 02:55.560
of introspection, seeing ourselves. It’s
very important. If we do not have a proper

02:57.030 --> 03:04.030
car we cannot drive. In the same way if our
being is in a funny situation then you cannot

03:06.190 --> 03:13.190
ascend; that’s a fact. So we have to understand
that the amount we enjoy everything is the

03:20.290 --> 03:27.290
sign how much we have achieved. If there’s
a little cup then a very little joy can go

03:30.940 --> 03:36.430
into it. But if there’s a large cup it gets
much more joy in it. But if it is like an

03:36.430 --> 03:43.430
ocean all the rivers of joys fall into it.
So it is the amount of enjoyment you have.

03:44.630 --> 03:51.630
Not fun, I mean enjoyment. I’m not saying
frivolousness, cheapishness, but a very majestic,

03:52.730 --> 03:59.330
deep enjoyment that you have within yourself,
which just bubbles into you, makes you very

03:59.330 --> 04:06.180
happy, and you don’t know why you are happy,
just enjoying your happiness. Then one has

04:06.180 --> 04:12.630
to say that you have really become a Sahaja
Yogi. And then, at that stage you want to

04:12.630 --> 04:17.819
share it. Don’t you keep it to yourself.
You’ll work very hard, do everything that

04:17.819 --> 04:24.270
is possible under the sun. Your mind will
think how to spread it, how to give this joy

04:24.270 --> 04:30.300
to others. You won’t be happy unless and
until you communicate with others. So first

04:30.300 --> 04:37.300
you become the capitalist and then you become
a communist.

04:37.889 --> 04:44.889
So first thing is how far we are enjoying.
Second is what have we got in our mind now,

04:47.360 --> 04:53.199
how are we going to expand Sahaja Yoga outside.
First, the light has to improve and automatically

04:53.199 --> 05:00.050
the light has to spread. What is the relationships
we have with ourselves, which I have told

05:00.050 --> 05:05.909
you before also, don’t form groups. This
is the country; that is the country. I would

05:05.909 --> 05:12.909
request you to change the buses and put different
people into the buses and let us see if they

05:13.669 --> 05:20.669
reach in one piece or not or there is a big
quarrel and a fight. If there is any quarrel

05:21.610 --> 05:28.610
or argument then drop that person on the way
and let him come by another bus. We don’t

05:32.740 --> 05:39.740
want argumentative spoiled sports with us.
So just put them on the ground, I tell you.

05:39.909 --> 05:44.370
And it’s a, it’s definitely, you must
know that I am telling you in the presence

05:44.370 --> 05:50.879
of everyone, anybody who is difficult just
ask him to get down here, “Please be here.

05:50.879 --> 05:57.879
Some bus will be coming and take you.” So
try to find out who are the spoiled sports.

05:59.539 --> 06:03.770
Another thing is some people have developed
a habit of moving their neck a bit too much.

06:03.770 --> 06:08.139
Even in singing they move their neck so much,
then their body. You can move your body but

06:08.139 --> 06:13.460
not the neck. Neck should be moved with the
body. Yesterday I had a problem with My liver.

06:13.460 --> 06:19.180
Then I thought you all have livers. But then
it was Vishuddhi and Vishuddhi must have come

06:19.180 --> 06:25.319
from the way you people move your neck. Like
if you say, “Yes, yes, yes, yes.” Or if

06:25.319 --> 06:30.719
you don’t want to say also, if I’m saying
anything you’ll go on like this, nodding.

06:30.719 --> 06:35.800
So don’t do all these things. That spoils
your Vishuddhi. As it is you have bad Vishuddhis,

06:35.800 --> 06:42.800
thanks to this Roman Catholic Church and the
other church which just talks. So please try

06:42.919 --> 06:49.719
to keep your neck in line with your body all
the time and even if you have to move, move

06:49.719 --> 06:55.729
very slightly your neck, not with jerks, and
don’t go on nodding. While music time I’ve

06:55.729 --> 07:02.729
seen many people do not move their body. But
if you see the Indians, they move their body.

07:03.800 --> 07:07.869
So this is one of a very small thing but is
important because your Vishuddhis have to

07:07.869 --> 07:13.449
be all right. There should be no problem on
your Vishuddhis. For liver also, there are

07:13.449 --> 07:19.729
some people I see still with liver who are
very thin people. They should be asked to

07:19.729 --> 07:26.729
stand in the water for one hour and clear
out themselves. If you are very thin, be sure

07:29.300 --> 07:36.300
it is not a normal thing. It is not natural.
It is abnormal to be very thin. So work it

07:36.849 --> 07:43.029
out ‒ it’s all your liver ‒ and later
on you can have a session of checking yourselves

07:43.029 --> 07:48.069
somewhere sitting. Before meditation you can
check yourselves what is wrong with you before

07:48.069 --> 07:52.039
My photograph and then you should go into
meditation.

07:52.039 --> 07:58.099
So now we are here on a pilgrimage to achieve
a higher state of awareness. Awareness is

07:58.099 --> 08:05.099
the main point, you should be absolutely aware.
As we were coming, I just said, “Now, this

08:09.719 --> 08:13.699
is wrong road.” They said, “How do you
know Mother?” I said, “Just I know. Just

08:13.699 --> 08:20.699
find out.” Just to know everything you need
not do anything about it. But that is the

08:22.729 --> 08:29.009
sign that you have become very aware. To be
aware of everything, it is not like sitting

08:29.009 --> 08:36.009
down here that you should say, “Oh, it’s
very beautiful. Oh, it’s very grand.”

08:36.110 --> 08:41.349
That’s not the point ‒ not to certify,
not to criticize ‒ but how much do you know.

08:41.349 --> 08:48.349
Feel it in the atmosphere. Because we have
a very big brain and we have two loops in

08:50.110 --> 08:57.110
our head, is not one brain but two loops.
And when the awareness starts giving you light

09:00.339 --> 09:07.339
you start knowing within yourself everything
and you are silent. You don’t have to assert,

09:10.550 --> 09:17.550
manipulate or to exert yourself but just to
know. And that’s a very beautiful thing

09:19.670 --> 09:26.670
one has to do. Those people who do not feel
vibrations must feel their vibrations in these

09:27.019 --> 09:34.019
two. They have to feel their vibrations in
these two. And those who are still complaining

09:36.170 --> 09:43.170
about their troubles and stomachs and livers
and this and that should get treated immediately

09:43.680 --> 09:50.680
and get well.

09:51.060 --> 09:56.509
Another thing which I can tell you which is
very important that in India you must comb

09:56.509 --> 10:02.560
you properly because they think you are all
beggars. Only the beggars have hair like this.

10:02.560 --> 10:09.079
Please put oil and make your hair properly.
They’ll not have any respect for you. You

10:09.079 --> 10:15.050
must have properly combed hair, groomed hair.
Otherwise they think you are something mad,

10:15.050 --> 10:20.100
or you are hippies or something gone wrong
with you. They don’t appreciate this fashion.

10:20.100 --> 10:27.100
Please make your hair properly, absolutely
in a proper way as they used to do. When we

10:27.519 --> 10:33.440
saw your western pictures when we were young,
they all were very well-groomed people. Now

10:33.440 --> 10:40.440
suddenly this fashion stupid has come to make
you all bald-headed and then to sell their

10:41.189 --> 10:48.189
‒ what you call them ‒ wigs. So this stupid
idea is wrong. Will you please now see that

10:50.440 --> 10:56.800
your hair are properly groomed and not to
have any hair on your, this thing. It’s

10:56.800 --> 11:02.610
a sign of stupidity in this country. Anybody
has, who has hair on the forehead it’s a

11:02.610 --> 11:09.610
sign of stupidity. We call it as “giprya”.
I asked Neeta what is the fashion now. She

11:13.269 --> 11:19.019
told Me in Marathi it is “giprya”. “Giprya”
means a person who gets mad or lunatic as

11:19.019 --> 11:25.129
the hair, hair you see like that. At least
we Sahaja Yogis should not follow such stupid

11:25.129 --> 11:32.129
fashions. They now take out hair like this,
you see. I just don’t know, like moustaches

11:32.430 --> 11:39.430
coming out of the head. You should be proud
of your forehead. It’s the Ekadesha. You

11:44.610 --> 11:51.610
have to fight the whole world with this Ekadesha
of yours. So please see that you keep your

11:52.029 --> 11:58.860
forehead absolutely open, hair properly done
and oily. That will also soothe you. In the

11:58.860 --> 12:04.060
night you can put some oil and it will soothe
you. You’ll find it very much better; specially

12:04.060 --> 12:09.689
for liver patient is very important. They
must put oil in their heads because they are

12:09.689 --> 12:16.680
dried out people. There’s no fat in their
hair and the hair do not grow. They become

12:16.680 --> 12:23.569
immediately bald as soon as they achieve twenty-five
to thirty years of age. I don’t want to

12:23.569 --> 12:30.569
have bald-headed Sahaja Yogis. Otherwise you’ll
have to wear the [shadings] like the Hare

12:31.180 --> 12:38.180
Rama Hare Krishna. If you make such clownish
appearances I’m worried about you because

12:40.420 --> 12:47.420
you don’t see the point what I am trying
to make. Look after your hair; it’s very

12:48.750 --> 12:50.100
important.

12:50.100 --> 12:57.100
All right, now last but not the least is a
request that we are here for meditation. Though

13:01.089 --> 13:05.360
we may sleep late I always get up at four
o’clock. Whatever time you may sleep, get

13:05.360 --> 13:10.120
up at four o’clock, do your meditation.
You can go after to sleep again. But that’s

13:10.120 --> 13:15.209
the best time to get up, have your baths,
whatever way you want, or wash yourself and

13:15.209 --> 13:20.889
just go for meditation. And then you can sleep
off again. That time you will find you will

13:20.889 --> 13:27.889
be quite alert and awake. It’s not so difficult.
You’ll all be awakened. I will awaken you.

13:30.639 --> 13:36.220
But please see that you get up in the morning,
do your meditation from four to five and then

13:36.220 --> 13:40.930
go off to sleep.

13:40.930 --> 13:47.610
We have to write a book about the Sahaj culture.
But it is going to come out of you people.

13:47.610 --> 13:53.259
If I write something then I am manipulating
you, I’m trying to tell you, but you have

13:53.259 --> 14:00.259
to write something yourself. You have to bring
out what is Sahaj culture is. You are already

14:01.999 --> 14:08.800
manifesting it without My telling you now.
So what is the Sahaj culture, how we work

14:08.800 --> 14:15.800
it out, ourselves, our things ‒ I don’t
tell you all these things into details. Also,

14:16.509 --> 14:23.319
try to judge where is your attention, what
are you doing about your attention. All the

14:23.319 --> 14:30.319
time keep an attention on your attention.
Where is my attention? Mr. Attention, where

14:30.379 --> 14:36.550
are you lost? And that will work out for you.
So now for today it’s sufficient.

14:36.550 --> 14:42.290
Already we are very late and I hope My lecture
doesn’t go over your heads or on the sides

14:42.290 --> 14:47.379
of your ears. It should go inside and you
should record it and whatever I am saying

14:47.379 --> 14:47.629
it’s very important. May God bless you all.
[Hindi]

14:47.540 --> 14:47.810
Will you please polish those things some time
and show them? All right. [Hindi]

14:47.810 --> 14:50.509
All the small children can come ‒ up to
ten years.
