Guru Puja
Cabella Ligure (Italy), 23 July 2000.

00:06:02.346 --> 00:06:14.724
Today we are here to know about guru principle.

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:24.146
What does a guru do.

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:49.180
Whatever you have, all the precious things
within you, he discovers them for your knowledge.

00:06:51.586 --> 00:06:58.620
Actually it is all there - everything.

00:06:59.565 --> 00:07:11.281
All the knowledge, all the spirituality, all
the joy, is there.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:23.366
(little laughter as a dog walks on stage)
Right time! (more laughter).

00:07:23.391 --> 00:07:30.774
It's all contained within you.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:51.361
Only thing the Guru does (is) makes you knowledgeable
about your knowledge, about your own spirit.

00:07:51.386 --> 00:07:58.705
Everyone has the Spirit within himself.

00:07:58.776 --> 00:08:05.006
Everyone has the spirituality within himself.

00:08:05.006 --> 00:08:10.976
There is nothing that you get from outside.

00:08:10.976 --> 00:08:24.418
But before getting this knowledge, you are
dealing, or you are living in ignorance.

00:08:24.443 --> 00:08:35.440
In that ignorance you do not know what treasure
you have got within yourself.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:49.692
So the guru's job is to make you know what
you are.

00:08:49.914 --> 00:08:53.975
That is the first step.

00:08:54.182 --> 00:09:08.126
That it starts, that awakening within you
by which you know that you are not this outside

00:09:08.126 --> 00:09:11.458
world, this is all an illusion.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:20.616
And you start getting enlightened within yourself.

00:09:20.862 --> 00:09:28.247
Some people get full light and some people
get it gradually.

00:09:28.358 --> 00:09:34.656
Essence of all the religions is that you should
know yourself.

00:09:34.656 --> 00:09:44.099
Those people who are fighting in the name
of religion, you have to go and ask them,

00:09:44.313 --> 00:09:53.859
you have to enquire from them, "Did your religion
make you know yourself?"

00:09:54.010 --> 00:10:00.116
If all the religions have said one thing [it's
that], you have to do all these things just

00:10:00.116 --> 00:10:03.522
to know yourself.

00:10:05.625 --> 00:10:09.356
But people get into rituals.

00:10:09.356 --> 00:10:16.116
They think that [by] doing all these rituals
they are near God.

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:28.407
They live in ignorance absolutely about themselves,
and day in and day out they work out something,

00:10:28.432 --> 00:10:33.636
which is nothing to do with yourself'.

00:10:33.661 --> 00:10:42.026
Lots of acrobats, prayers, pujas, these things
go on.

00:10:42.152 --> 00:10:45.681
Because it is all ignorance.

00:10:45.887 --> 00:10:56.868
People go on paying them money and they become
very rich and their interest is only money.

00:10:57.096 --> 00:11:08.172
They want to take all your money, absolutely,
and make a fool out of you.

00:11:08.212 --> 00:11:11.126
They pamper your ego.

00:11:11.126 --> 00:11:24.066
With pampering of that ego you just start
drifting into the ocean of illusion and you

00:11:24.066 --> 00:11:32.766
are drowned into that illusion, thinking that
you are very religious and you are just in

00:11:32.766 --> 00:11:35.886
connection with God, which you are not.

00:11:36.036 --> 00:11:41.292
To know God you should know your Self first.

00:11:41.419 --> 00:11:46.417
Without knowing that, you cannot know God.

00:11:46.504 --> 00:11:53.106
That's essential, that you should know your
Self.

00:11:53.106 --> 00:11:58.646
But when you know yourself, you know partly.

00:11:58.646 --> 00:12:03.766
The experience is not sufficient.

00:12:03.766 --> 00:12:07.551
The knowledge has to come.

00:12:07.765 --> 00:12:14.652
And the guru gives the knowledge about your
Self.

00:12:14.803 --> 00:12:18.852
Now you have to tally it.

00:12:18.963 --> 00:12:23.235
You should find out whatever your guru has
told you.

00:12:23.298 --> 00:12:25.513
Is it true or not?

00:12:25.538 --> 00:12:28.038
Is it correct or not?

00:12:28.244 --> 00:12:33.016
Or is it just another illusion?

00:12:33.016 --> 00:12:40.744
Now in this ascent people get into lots of
problems.

00:12:40.911 --> 00:12:46.016
First and foremost is the ego problem, especially
in the west.

00:12:46.016 --> 00:12:54.277
Ego stands up and you start thinking you are
great, you are better than others, and there

00:12:54.277 --> 00:12:57.606
is something special about you.

00:12:57.662 --> 00:13:07.015
This ignorance is more dangerous than the
worldly ignorance, I think, because in the

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:19.762
worldly ignorance, you do feel the consequences
of wrong things.

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:32.860
But when you are half way, when your ignorance
is that about yourself, when you are going

00:13:33.034 --> 00:13:42.196
to a higher realm, then one should always
understand that you cannot have ego.

00:13:42.196 --> 00:13:56.061
Then what starts is introspection.

00:13:56.355 --> 00:14:05.272
You start looking at yourself, what's wrong
with you.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:11.466
When you understand that you have ego, you
start looking at yourself.

00:14:11.466 --> 00:14:24.666
Or when you find there is something missing
or something wrong, then also, you start introspecting.

00:14:24.666 --> 00:14:33.331
This should be a very, very honest, very honest
effort.

00:14:33.474 --> 00:14:38.912
Some people in Sahaja Yoga, at a very early
stage start thinking they that they are very

00:14:38.937 --> 00:14:44.242
great and they don't need any introspection.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:55.685
And they rise again into the clouds of ignorance
without achieving Selfhood, or I can call

00:14:55.685 --> 00:14:58.593
it Self realisation.

00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:07.049
So you have to introspect and see for yourself
what have you been doing, what are you,

00:15:07.327 --> 00:15:11.515
how far you have come.

00:15:11.594 --> 00:15:16.905
How much -- please don't translate just now
all right?

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:22.216
You can do it later on.

00:15:22.279 --> 00:15:26.786
You must hear with full concentration.

00:15:26.786 --> 00:15:34.679
Even if you don't understand it will work
-- now the style of such a person changes

00:15:34.704 --> 00:15:35.719
gradually.

00:15:35.744 --> 00:15:36.976
How?

00:15:36.976 --> 00:15:50.055
First of all a person who is extremely aggressive,
hot-tempered, and full of ego, starts becoming

00:15:50.055 --> 00:15:54.126
very gentle and mild.

00:15:54.206 --> 00:16:07.789
Another type which is frightened and afraid
and very cautious starts becoming fearless.

00:16:07.948 --> 00:16:13.516
At that stage you have no fears.

00:16:13.516 --> 00:16:23.935
You are sure that you are on the right path
and you are moving on the right lines.

00:16:24.102 --> 00:16:27.316
You are not easily disturbed there.

00:16:27.341 --> 00:16:38.365
But still you have to rise higher and higher;
where, when you meditate, you understand there

00:16:38.365 --> 00:16:42.790
is something wrong within yourself.

00:16:42.853 --> 00:16:49.296
You have achieved your Self realisation; you
have got the blessings of Self realisation.

00:16:49.296 --> 00:16:58.236
Your health is good, you have got all kinds
of blessings which you cannot count.

00:16:58.236 --> 00:17:09.270
All that is there but...still you have to
go further.

00:17:09.357 --> 00:17:23.966
And that is to understand all the knowledge
about Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:24.149 --> 00:17:32.156
You have to understand through your mental
capacity, first, to begin with, then you have

00:17:32.156 --> 00:17:37.967
to verify how far it is correct.

00:17:38.086 --> 00:17:52.316
How far you have understood it, how far you
have worked on it, how far you know.

00:17:52.459 --> 00:18:08.331
And when you start seeing yourself, you start
entering into the realm of Bhakti.

00:18:08.441 --> 00:18:18.200
You become a mild person, become a sweet person,
you don't talk too much, you don't harass

00:18:18.225 --> 00:18:30.016
anyone; you are a very pleasant person, very
gentle, very understanding.

00:18:30.016 --> 00:18:41.156
This person has to verify how he is behaving
towards others.

00:18:41.156 --> 00:18:54.643
Now the attention starts moving from oneself
to another and you start seeing how you behave.

00:18:54.755 --> 00:18:59.230
How you love.

00:18:59.255 --> 00:19:04.121
What is the quality of your compassion?

00:19:07.498 --> 00:19:20.536
When you love somebody without any expectations,
just love, then you are absolutely dedicated

00:19:20.536 --> 00:19:28.198
to that person, absolutely; you just obey.

00:19:28.285 --> 00:19:31.990
You will do anything for that person.

00:19:32.164 --> 00:19:39.445
If there is this love which you call as surrender.

00:19:39.445 --> 00:19:43.146
This is just the love.

00:19:43.146 --> 00:19:52.016
Surrender is nothing but the love, and that
love which is extremely joy-giving.

00:19:52.016 --> 00:20:07.081
this bhakti starts, this dedication starts,
and you are cleansed by that bhakti.

00:20:07.144 --> 00:20:20.505
All the bad qualities you have, you can call
them, all the deficiencies you have, all the

00:20:20.505 --> 00:20:29.692
problems you have, you understand and you
get over it.

00:20:29.867 --> 00:20:43.776
Now if you see somebody with the same qualities,
with the same troubles, you in the love of

00:20:43.801 --> 00:20:49.577
that person you try to tolerate.

00:20:49.602 --> 00:20:57.535
Such a person just tolerates.

00:21:02.889 --> 00:21:13.061
There is no aggression, and these people forgive.

00:21:13.196 --> 00:21:19.255
Realised Souls go on forgiving; their capacity
to forgive is tremendous.

00:21:19.255 --> 00:21:25.892
They do not bear any malice against anyone.

00:21:25.917 --> 00:21:29.575
They don't have any anger about anyone.

00:21:29.639 --> 00:21:36.210
They just go on tolerating and forgiving and
forgiving.

00:21:36.313 --> 00:21:47.261
This forgiveness is just a music, I should
say, of your bhakti.

00:21:47.372 --> 00:21:55.065
The amount of forgiveness these masters could
have can be seen from [the] life of Christ.

00:21:55.065 --> 00:22:01.700
They are tortured, crucified - most of the
saints were tortured.

00:22:01.725 --> 00:22:04.272
People never liked them.

00:22:04.297 --> 00:22:18.485
And they were crucified, but as you know that
they never resented, they never take a revenge,

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:24.995
they never did anything which was not compassionate.

00:22:24.995 --> 00:22:30.429
They had compassion, and compassion for such
people

00:22:30.623 --> 00:22:37.084
they felt that 'Oh God, please forgive them.

00:22:38.615 --> 00:22:43.491
What they are doing they don't know'.

00:22:43.516 --> 00:22:46.357
Extremely compassionate.

00:22:46.382 --> 00:22:50.336
And they are that, that becomes their nature.

00:22:50.336 --> 00:23:01.785
When it becomes their nature they become people
with complete peace.

00:23:01.785 --> 00:23:05.498
They are not disturbed.

00:23:05.523 --> 00:23:15.029
They are never disturbed with whatever is
happening and they think it's God's will.

00:23:15.054 --> 00:23:23.020
Because nothing can disturb them, nothing
can upset them.

00:23:23.045 --> 00:23:30.471
They just enjoy their devotion.

00:23:30.566 --> 00:23:36.060
Devotion to their guru, maybe.

00:23:36.108 --> 00:23:41.291
Devotion to God.

00:23:41.497 --> 00:23:53.046
In that devotion they may write beautiful
poetry, they may go on dancing, they may go

00:23:53.046 --> 00:24:01.796
on singing, because the peace is within and
they are enjoying themselves.

00:24:04.591 --> 00:24:13.468
When they are alone, they are never alone,
they enjoy themselves.

00:24:13.493 --> 00:24:27.562
They know that - "We are one with the Divine"
- and the blessing of the Divine they enjoy.

00:24:27.587 --> 00:24:33.058
Another thing is they never take to artificiality.

00:24:33.083 --> 00:24:43.976
They are never worried, never upset, they
are neither futuristic nor think of the past,

00:24:43.976 --> 00:24:46.696
but they are in the present.

00:24:49.327 --> 00:24:55.896
When they are in the present, they are absolutely
silent.

00:24:55.896 --> 00:25:02.749
If there is any problem, or anything happens
to them,

00:25:02.888 --> 00:25:07.460
they immediately go into thoughtless awareness.

00:25:08.761 --> 00:25:14.445
That is what their capacity is.

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:22.426
To become a guru you have to develop that
personality; not to be bound by anything.

00:25:22.426 --> 00:25:26.402
Now I'll tell you my own example.

00:25:26.561 --> 00:25:33.242
I never hurry, I'm never bothered about time.

00:25:33.267 --> 00:25:41.776
Once I was going to America - because if you
are sure the Divine has plans for you, you

00:25:41.776 --> 00:25:48.574
are not bothered, the Divine is looking after
you so why to bother -- I was going to America

00:25:48.599 --> 00:25:50.506
and one child fell down.

00:25:50.506 --> 00:25:57.794
I was just about to get up and go and broke
her arm.

00:25:57.819 --> 00:26:02.936
And when I saw the child I said "All right,
I'll put that child right".

00:26:02.936 --> 00:26:05.344
"But," they said, "You are going to America!"

00:26:05.369 --> 00:26:08.429
I said, "I'll go in any case!

00:26:08.454 --> 00:26:14.506
"So I cured the child, it took about half
an hour, and then I came out "All right, let's

00:26:14.506 --> 00:26:16.078
go to the airport".

00:26:16.103 --> 00:26:20.606
They said "Mother you are very late" I said,
"I'm never late.

00:26:20.606 --> 00:26:22.790
Let's go!".

00:26:22.815 --> 00:26:31.210
We went there, to the airport, and the plane
by which I was going was out of order, so

00:26:31.235 --> 00:26:35.027
there was another plane going to Washington
not to New York,

00:26:35.052 --> 00:26:38.871
and I wanted to go to Washington only!

00:26:39.085 --> 00:26:46.796
So just imagine how things work out, and we
call them 'Sahaja'.

00:26:46.821 --> 00:26:54.430
It has worked out 'Sahaja'.

00:26:58.799 --> 00:27:02.939
That means it's a effortless.

00:27:03.971 --> 00:27:22.646
But first of all your personality should be
such that your devotion is so great that Divine

00:27:22.646 --> 00:27:34.128
is compelled to look after you...compelled
to look after you!

00:27:34.153 --> 00:27:47.469
You have to understand that Divine force is
around you, and this Divine force is absolute

00:27:47.494 --> 00:27:51.436
guarantee for your safety.

00:27:51.436 --> 00:27:56.640
For everything that you want to do.

00:27:58.005 --> 00:28:03.056
You can say that "Mother you are very powerful".

00:28:03.056 --> 00:28:05.765
You can become also very powerful!

00:28:05.861 --> 00:28:16.266
If you get completely dedicated to the Divine
work, you will also have all the powers and

00:28:16.266 --> 00:28:26.049
the Divine will provide all the necessary
work that you want to do, necessary time that

00:28:26.074 --> 00:28:27.565
you have to have.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:33.563
Everything is provided by the Divine.

00:28:33.609 --> 00:28:44.835
But the compassion, when it extends from other
people to God, or to Divine person, or to

00:28:44.869 --> 00:29:00.757
your guru, then it becomes very easy to live,
very simple to live, no complications, everything

00:29:00.757 --> 00:29:06.746
is sorted out, and you are not bothered about
anything.

00:29:06.746 --> 00:29:13.569
You just close your eyes and things work out.

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:23.576
Everything works out as if that's your will,
but you don't have to will it, don't have

00:29:23.576 --> 00:29:28.876
to think about it, it just works out, but
Divine looks after everything.

00:29:28.876 --> 00:29:38.016
It looks after your comfort, looks after your
health, everything.

00:29:38.016 --> 00:29:51.866
And this Divine help, you do not seek, you
do not ask for, but you are a personality

00:29:51.866 --> 00:29:56.035
for which the Divine is responsible.

00:29:56.122 --> 00:30:02.029
You are a special responsibility of the Divine.

00:30:02.054 --> 00:30:07.941
And it knows what is good for you and what
is not.

00:30:07.966 --> 00:30:16.866
It's an example, I can give many where I,
supposing, I thought somebody is coming to

00:30:16.866 --> 00:30:24.108
meet me, and people told me "Mother, he's
very negative", He will never come,

00:30:24.133 --> 00:30:26.674
 he'll never come.

00:30:26.881 --> 00:30:33.497
All positive things will happen, and if a
negative things take place, then you will

00:30:33.522 --> 00:30:36.164
use your compassion.

00:30:36.189 --> 00:30:42.067
If it is negative you'll use your compassion
and you'll solve the problem.

00:30:42.131 --> 00:30:52.117
You can solve the problems of your own, of
your surroundings, of your community.

00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:56.265
So now you have got your Self realisation.

00:30:56.290 --> 00:31:00.001
How far you have gone in that I don't know.

00:31:00.081 --> 00:31:08.102
I have a complaint about women, so many ladies,
that they don't meditate.

00:31:08.459 --> 00:31:15.956
That they are not looking after themselves,
they are not realised souls, and that's why

00:31:15.956 --> 00:31:24.173
many men want to divorce them because they
think these women are good for nothing.

00:31:24.261 --> 00:31:31.411
And some men also are like that.

00:31:31.451 --> 00:31:41.926
To solve this problem you have to have compassion,
and you have to, somehow or other, with compassion,

00:31:41.926 --> 00:31:48.716
you should win over the partner of your life.

00:31:48.741 --> 00:31:54.216
After all men are much more busy than women
are.

00:31:54.216 --> 00:31:59.266
But women indulge into so many other things.

00:31:59.266 --> 00:32:05.280
They have to look after their family, their
children, their everything.

00:32:05.795 --> 00:32:15.516
And their mind is involved into all such mundane
things that they have no time to meditate.

00:32:15.516 --> 00:32:19.073
Without meditation you cannot rise.

00:32:19.098 --> 00:32:22.786
You have to meditate.

00:32:22.786 --> 00:32:25.029
People think that: "Now we have got realisation,
so it's all right".

00:32:25.054 --> 00:32:26.218
No!

00:32:26.243 --> 00:32:32.775
Every day you must meditate because that's
the cleansing that takes place.

00:32:33.276 --> 00:32:38.103
With the cleansing you understand.

00:32:38.128 --> 00:32:47.254
You understand what is needed and what is
not needed, you are cleansed out.

00:32:47.341 --> 00:32:49.726
That is done by Divine.

00:32:49.726 --> 00:32:58.486
But you must religiously meditate.

00:32:58.486 --> 00:33:07.485
Gradually you will find your meditation will
become very deep.

00:33:07.516 --> 00:33:19.256
You will become very, very deep and your powers
will start showing.

00:33:19.256 --> 00:33:25.776
When you are anywhere, negativity will run
away.

00:33:25.776 --> 00:33:32.418
All sorts of problems can be solved.

00:33:32.443 --> 00:33:37.053
Whatever you want to do is available to you.

00:33:37.078 --> 00:33:46.936
Whatever is your desire to help others or
give to someone, you just get it.

00:33:46.936 --> 00:33:52.046
Is my own experience I'm telling you.

00:33:52.046 --> 00:34:02.137
You have to meditate at least 10 minutes every
evening, and morning about 5 minutes.

00:34:02.162 --> 00:34:07.756
With complete devotion, with complete admiration.

00:34:07.756 --> 00:34:18.546
I have seen some people here, such bhakti,
such devotion, which is shraddha - is higher

00:34:18.546 --> 00:34:24.446
than bhakti - that it becomes part and parcel
of your being.

00:34:24.446 --> 00:34:29.576
It just envelops you completely.

00:34:29.576 --> 00:34:35.583
When you have that shraddha, it is very miraculous.

00:34:35.608 --> 00:34:39.139
It works so many miracles.

00:34:39.164 --> 00:34:46.891
It's true some people were cured only thinking
of me, is a fact.

00:34:47.018 --> 00:34:54.536
But that doesn't mean that they had the shraddha
of that level, but that means that they have

00:34:54.536 --> 00:34:57.145
to develop shraddha.

00:34:57.170 --> 00:35:06.195
Now how to develop a shraddha, which is a
natural light of the Spirit.

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:19.026
Because people are trying very hard to develop
shraddha, but shraddha cannot be developed

00:35:19.026 --> 00:35:26.576
by mental activity, by any activity, but meditation
of silence.

00:35:26.576 --> 00:35:33.556
If you do the meditation .... I have always
told you to do meditation.

00:35:33.556 --> 00:35:38.940
I immediately know a person who has been meditating
and who has not been.

00:35:39.225 --> 00:35:47.776
They'll come to my puja, all right; and they'll
talk about Sahaja Yoga, they'll go out and

00:35:47.776 --> 00:35:50.968
do it for popularity.

00:35:50.993 --> 00:35:53.466
Many people are like that.

00:35:53.466 --> 00:35:58.136
They go out, and for popularity they work
it out.

00:35:58.136 --> 00:36:04.701
But inside they have not yet traced their
own Self.

00:36:04.741 --> 00:36:12.928
So at this development stage you should be
encouraged, and [should be] understood that

00:36:12.968 --> 00:36:22.396
you can reach that state very easily through
meditation and introspection.

00:36:22.396 --> 00:36:33.386
With introspection you will develop a new
quality of understanding that, you will find

00:36:33.386 --> 00:36:36.646
solutions to things.

00:36:36.671 --> 00:36:42.326
That is another quality a person who is a
realised soul has.

00:36:42.326 --> 00:36:50.020
It can find solutions to all your problems.

00:36:50.115 --> 00:37:00.461
It can, he can suggest what is the way you
can be helped.

00:37:00.596 --> 00:37:05.899
Then a kind of a brotherhood out of the shraddha
develops.

00:37:05.924 --> 00:37:12.446
You may be giving big lectures on Sahaja Yoga,
you may be doing all kinds of things, but

00:37:12.446 --> 00:37:19.573
unless and until you have shraddha, you cannot
rise.

00:37:19.598 --> 00:37:29.115
And this shraddha is a kind of a love within
you, I should say, which spreads like gentle

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:41.946
fire which doesn't burn, which doesn't give
heat, but cold, beautiful breeze-like feeling

00:37:41.946 --> 00:37:45.636
within, which makes you understand.

00:37:45.636 --> 00:37:53.264
You will never talk ill about a sahaja yogi,
never.

00:37:53.289 --> 00:37:59.166
I never listen to anybody who tells me something
against sahaja yogi.

00:37:59.166 --> 00:38:08.105
Up to a point, when it is a collective complaint,
then I am little bit bothered and I talk about

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:10.296
it to the leader.

00:38:10.359 --> 00:38:16.976
But otherwise if one person comes and tells
me this and this, I just tell that person

00:38:16.976 --> 00:38:20.945
"You introspect yourself , it's not so".

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:33.906
Finding faults with others is a common game
all human beings play.

00:38:33.906 --> 00:38:36.445
They never see their own faults.

00:38:36.477 --> 00:38:40.545
What's the use of finding faults of others?

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:46.369
By finding faults with others you're not going
to be helped.

00:38:46.394 --> 00:38:52.512
Try to find faults within you, which you can
cure, which you can help,

00:38:52.687 --> 00:38:57.347
which you can work it out.

00:38:57.372 --> 00:39:05.882
It's a responsibility you have, you must know,
to yourself that you better find out your

00:39:05.907 --> 00:39:10.256
defects and get them corrected.

00:39:10.256 --> 00:39:17.842
But some people are very proud of their fondness
-- they talk like this,

00:39:17.867 --> 00:39:20.546
"I like this, I like that".

00:39:20.546 --> 00:39:24.465
But what about the Spirit?

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:29.236
You like this, you like that, then what about
your Spirit?

00:39:29.236 --> 00:39:31.026
Does it like?

00:39:31.026 --> 00:39:36.036
Does it enjoy?

00:39:36.036 --> 00:39:40.196
They'll go on saying "I like this, I don't
like this, I don't like that!"

00:39:40.196 --> 00:39:44.726
It's very common in the West.

00:39:44.726 --> 00:39:48.956
Now see, some ladies have made this beautiful
carpets for me.

00:39:48.956 --> 00:39:57.026
They are so thick that when I walk on them
I little bit lose balance, but the love with

00:39:57.026 --> 00:40:06.641
which they are made, makes me so joyous, so
happy, that you can't imagine

00:40:06.666 --> 00:40:10.184
 what I feel about them.

00:40:10.184 --> 00:40:15.822
This joy, this ocean of joy, is within you.

00:40:15.847 --> 00:40:27.504
And when it starts stirring up, it doesn't
torment you, it gives you beautiful -- I don't

00:40:27.505 --> 00:40:36.593
know how to use words to express that -- it's
like a drizzle on your being, it's like a

00:40:36.618 --> 00:40:39.305
grace on your being.

00:40:39.305 --> 00:40:43.902
The love of other people enthrals you.

00:40:44.822 --> 00:40:57.515
You don't ask for it, but if you see a person
who is very loving and kind, there is real

00:40:57.515 --> 00:41:00.755
friendship in that kind of relationship.

00:41:00.755 --> 00:41:06.887
But talking ill about sahaja yogis, it's very
wrong.

00:41:06.912 --> 00:41:13.381
And then talking to everyone that "this is
wrong with this person, he had done this,

00:41:13.406 --> 00:41:22.944
he had done that", is very, very wrong and
creating a collective feeling against the

00:41:22.969 --> 00:41:26.716
person -- instead of helping that person.

00:41:26.716 --> 00:41:30.218
Always people are in trouble.

00:41:30.243 --> 00:41:33.649
Then collectively you must help that person.

00:41:33.674 --> 00:41:35.197
Not talk ill of that person.

00:41:35.222 --> 00:41:44.806
May be some mistakes, but if you start talking
against that person and saying that 'This

00:41:44.806 --> 00:41:51.254
is wrong with him, that is wrong with him',
then you are not a sahaja yogi.

00:41:51.279 --> 00:42:00.737
You are a sahaja yogi as long as you can see
your own defects through introspection.

00:42:01.753 --> 00:42:07.318
Now many of you, I should say most of you,
have got your realisation.

00:42:07.421 --> 00:42:10.413
You had the experience.

00:42:10.438 --> 00:42:16.638
But some of you don't have the knowledge.

00:42:16.663 --> 00:42:22.919
That knowledge you should acquire, and verify
whether that knowledge

00:42:22.944 --> 00:42:25.975
 is really there or not.

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:40.626
Like in America, in the N.I.H., which is an
Institute for Health, they wanted to test

00:42:40.626 --> 00:42:45.015
a sahaja yogi, and there were doctors.

00:42:45.015 --> 00:42:49.197
And one doctor came forward and said "All
right, tell me on your vibration

00:42:49.222 --> 00:42:51.515
 what's wrong with me".

00:42:51.515 --> 00:43:00.275
So the girl said, "Sir, something wrong with
your heart" and he said, "It's correct" because

00:43:00.275 --> 00:43:10.089
he has had a bypass only one month back and
he was out of hospital.

00:43:10.114 --> 00:43:13.835
Absolutely correct, and this surprised them.

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:19.205
That diagnosis, you see, kills the patient
half way.

00:43:19.205 --> 00:43:26.233
So this is the very easy way to diagnose a
person, just by feeling the vibration.

00:43:26.258 --> 00:43:31.226
And they have given us such a good attention,

00:43:31.251 --> 00:43:37.856
they want to develop Sahaja Yoga in their hospitals.

00:43:41.713 --> 00:43:50.741
So you should also testify yourself, examine
yourself and find out about yourself,

00:43:50.766 --> 00:43:54.906
 what are you?

00:43:55.683 --> 00:44:06.906
Say husband and wife -- now the wife meditates,
she knows everything, she knows about her

00:44:06.906 --> 00:44:27.024
husband, what's wrong with him and she doesn't
tell him.

00:44:27.175 --> 00:44:36.123
She tolerates, she doesn't complain, she doesn't
ask for anything, she just tolerates.

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:46.435
And this tolerance convinces the husband that
she's a higher personality than himself.

00:44:46.482 --> 00:44:53.930
He may be anything, but he then understands
that this is what she has achieved,

00:44:53.955 --> 00:44:57.077
 a great personality.

00:44:57.102 --> 00:45:03.856
We have so many imperfections, especially
morally, in the West, people are really, I

00:45:03.856 --> 00:45:07.093
tell you, like one snake has bitten them.

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:17.856
The things that people do here never come
into the minds of people who are not developed.

00:45:17.856 --> 00:45:29.663
So development has meant all kinds of abandonment,
all kinds of vagabond temperament, and they

00:45:29.806 --> 00:45:35.948
think they are very free and they can go about
and enjoy.

00:45:35.973 --> 00:45:45.716
This style is very common, but you just judge
yourself.

00:45:45.741 --> 00:45:48.695
Are you one of these type?

00:45:48.695 --> 00:45:55.336
Or are you one of the people who are higher
than you in their ascent.

00:45:55.336 --> 00:45:58.655
It's a process, I must confess.

00:45:58.655 --> 00:46:04.125
It is not just [that] you get to that point.

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:13.596
Sometimes even very new sahaja yogis are better
than very old sahaja yogis, but because they

00:46:13.596 --> 00:46:16.876
had a very strong desire.

00:46:16.901 --> 00:46:19.136
What are we seeking?

00:46:19.136 --> 00:46:26.686
We should understand why we were seeking -- because
we wanted to know ourselves.

00:46:26.686 --> 00:46:32.562
Somehow, we knew that we have to know ourselves,
and we did not know.

00:46:32.601 --> 00:46:33.958
So we seek.

00:46:33.983 --> 00:46:35.038
We seek.

00:46:35.379 --> 00:46:40.911
We do all kinds of things, I mean all wrong
things also in the name of seeking.

00:46:40.958 --> 00:46:49.797
But it is this seeking brings you to Sahaja
Yoga.

00:46:49.932 --> 00:46:57.175
Then you have to get your Self realisation,
which is very easy through Kundalini.

00:46:57.175 --> 00:47:01.394
Kundalini works out most of the things, most
of the things.

00:47:01.419 --> 00:47:09.861
Like somebody told me that overnight she gave
up drinking and smoking -- overnight.

00:47:11.809 --> 00:47:15.946
I mean I don't tell that, I never say that.

00:47:15.977 --> 00:47:22.446
But just overnight she gave up, and she said
"I was very particular about my hair dress

00:47:22.557 --> 00:47:29.165
and I used to make my hair dress in a different
manner, going to the hairdressers, spending

00:47:29.165 --> 00:47:32.386
so much time with the beautician, this, that".

00:47:32.386 --> 00:47:34.730
She said, "I gave it up".

00:47:34.755 --> 00:47:43.886
Also she said "I used to wear dresses which
were not very moral, then I started respecting

00:47:43.886 --> 00:47:47.876
my body and I started wearing proper dress".

00:47:47.876 --> 00:47:57.445
All this knowledge comes to you, spontaneously
it is within you, because it is all your own.

00:47:57.470 --> 00:48:01.966
Also if your guru tells you, you are guided.

00:48:01.991 --> 00:48:05.611
Guru's job is to guide people.

00:48:05.802 --> 00:48:10.196
So at this juncture, what is lacking?

00:48:10.196 --> 00:48:14.418
What is lacking in Sahaja Yoga?

00:48:14.443 --> 00:48:16.918
That I have to tell you.

00:48:16.973 --> 00:48:23.621
There are so many collective disasters we
have - all kinds of.

00:48:23.646 --> 00:48:33.435
We had many earthquakes, we had many floods,
rain, then the muds - mud came down like a

00:48:33.435 --> 00:48:41.035
river; and so many disasters in the world
and sahaja yogis are saved from that.

00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:46.891
All the sahaja yogis are saved from that,
no doubt, but after being saved,

00:48:46.916 --> 00:48:50.043
 what is your understanding?

00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:52.767
What do you know?

00:48:52.792 --> 00:48:56.513
Why these disasters are coming?

00:48:56.538 --> 00:49:01.254
Because Sahaja Yoga is not very collective.

00:49:01.279 --> 00:49:04.035
It has to become very collective.

00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:08.142
It has to spread much more, all over.

00:49:08.221 --> 00:49:12.366
It has to go to many people, which we don't
do.

00:49:12.391 --> 00:49:16.858
We are at a standstill, or little bit we do
it.

00:49:16.937 --> 00:49:18.954
But go all out!

00:49:18.979 --> 00:49:21.989
Look at Christ's twelve disciples!

00:49:22.014 --> 00:49:26.714
Of course the people went into wrong things.

00:49:26.793 --> 00:49:34.279
But how they worked and how intensively they
did it.

00:49:34.304 --> 00:49:44.046
That intensity if you don't have, and if you
do not completely dedicate to the spreading

00:49:44.046 --> 00:49:52.396
of Sahaja Yoga, then collective problems cannot
be solved.

00:49:52.421 --> 00:49:58.126
You are busy with your daily mundane things,
and your other jobs and everything; it's all

00:49:58.151 --> 00:50:01.880
right, in Sahaja Yoga no objection.

00:50:01.905 --> 00:50:14.371
But you should have your attention more on
to this side of life that - 'What are we doing

00:50:14.396 --> 00:50:16.201
for the collective?

00:50:16.226 --> 00:50:18.177
Are we talking about it?

00:50:18.202 --> 00:50:20.107
Are we spreading Sahaja Yoga?

00:50:20.132 --> 00:50:24.686
Are we making people know about it?'

00:50:24.686 --> 00:50:28.786
I was surprised, once I was coming by plane

00:50:28.811 --> 00:50:36.803
and a lady sat next to me and had very bad vibrations.

00:50:40.138 --> 00:50:49.893
I put myself into bandhan, and I asked her
what is she doing for her spirituality, and

00:50:49.918 --> 00:50:53.445
she gave the name of 'Bahai' people.

00:50:53.445 --> 00:50:56.505
"My God" I said.

00:50:56.505 --> 00:51:01.995
If these people spread out, they are so spread
out, they are so many!

00:51:01.995 --> 00:51:03.986
So, what will happen?

00:51:04.011 --> 00:51:06.186
Disasters!

00:51:06.186 --> 00:51:14.235
They are such negative people, impossible
that they can do any good to the world.

00:51:14.235 --> 00:51:23.716
And like that you see, anybody, false guru,
how people are driven to them, how they take

00:51:23.716 --> 00:51:26.306
to them, and how they spread their message.

00:51:26.306 --> 00:51:35.186
I have seen people singing on the road, singing
the praise of their guru, and also wearing

00:51:35.186 --> 00:51:39.966
funny dresses -- we don't want that kind of
a thing.

00:51:39.991 --> 00:51:46.608
But of course you have got the knowledge,
of course you are realised souls.

00:51:46.633 --> 00:51:50.859
But what have you done for Sahaja Yoga is
the point.

00:51:50.914 --> 00:51:57.468
You have to spread Sahaja Yoga...everywhere.

00:51:57.753 --> 00:52:07.285
For example, you wear a badge, then they will
ask you "What is this supposed to be?"

00:52:07.285 --> 00:52:11.430
Then you have to tell them what is it, something.

00:52:11.455 --> 00:52:14.155
You start talking about Sahaja Yoga only!

00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:17.296
Talk nothing else but Sahaja Yoga.

00:52:17.321 --> 00:52:24.076
You have to go on talking about Sahaja Yoga,
spreading Sahaja Yoga: unless and until you

00:52:24.076 --> 00:52:29.856
do it, it won't become collective, and all
the disasters, which are due to collective

00:52:29.856 --> 00:52:34.430
nonsense, you get it.

00:52:35.391 --> 00:52:38.817
You are saved from so many things.

00:52:38.842 --> 00:52:44.063
Say even if there's pollution, for a sahaja
yogi it won't matter.

00:52:44.088 --> 00:52:51.494
Even if there is a disaster of an earthquake
the sahaja yogi will be saved.

00:52:51.519 --> 00:52:55.046
But why not save the whole world?

00:52:55.071 --> 00:53:03.086
Calamities after calamities are coming, and
if you have compassion you must think of the

00:53:03.086 --> 00:53:08.954
people who can get into any calamity or into
any trouble.

00:53:08.979 --> 00:53:13.966
Of course I can cure many people, no doubt.

00:53:13.966 --> 00:53:18.435
But I don't know how to make Sahaja Yoga very
collective.

00:53:18.435 --> 00:53:27.285
Now you are so many people here, you all can
start giving realisation to at least 100 people.

00:53:27.285 --> 00:53:29.096
Go everywhere.

00:53:29.096 --> 00:53:32.433
Talk about Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:32.458 --> 00:53:40.405
Sing the praise of the Divine, and you will
save the whole world.

00:53:40.405 --> 00:53:49.496
It is not by saving some few people you can
have the great Satya Yuga, but you have also

00:53:49.496 --> 00:53:52.076
to save this Mother Earth.

00:53:52.076 --> 00:53:54.655
You have to save the people who are in it.

00:53:54.655 --> 00:54:01.311
I mean, the way these people are, I have seen
so many of them on the television.

00:54:01.336 --> 00:54:06.277
They, shamelessly they are talking about something
which they don't know.

00:54:06.302 --> 00:54:10.035
And they have thousands and thousands of people
behind them.

00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:13.608
Not that the people are stupid.

00:54:13.633 --> 00:54:23.715
Not that they want to go on a wrong path,
but these people who are false, or who are

00:54:23.715 --> 00:54:29.508
wrong, know how to entice them, how to capture
them, how to talk to them.

00:54:29.564 --> 00:54:39.475
But a sahaja yogi, you see, if he sees somebody
with a negative vibrations will run away.

00:54:39.704 --> 00:54:46.473
He will escape such a society, will not go
near them, and will say "Oh, very bad vibrations,

00:54:46.515 --> 00:54:48.328
we don't want!".

00:54:48.353 --> 00:54:56.488
So you have to be courageous and get into
these places, talk to people and make it collective.

00:54:56.513 --> 00:55:02.005
Otherwise you cannot save this world from
the wrath of God.

00:55:02.005 --> 00:55:04.930
God is wrathful, no doubt.

00:55:05.462 --> 00:55:09.195
For you, he'll save you, but what's the use?

00:55:09.195 --> 00:55:13.093
We have to save this Mother Earth.

00:55:13.118 --> 00:55:20.906
And for that you have to be prepared, you
have to work it out, and whenever you get

00:55:20.906 --> 00:55:24.040
a chance you must spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:55:24.065 --> 00:55:28.566
Some people told me "Mother, if you come then
it will be All right" Why?

00:55:28.566 --> 00:55:34.106
What's so much? .... you can be also like
me.

00:55:34.106 --> 00:55:36.539
You can talk about it to people.

00:55:36.564 --> 00:55:43.562
I started Sahaja Yoga with one person and,
that time, it was complete darkness everywhere.

00:55:43.587 --> 00:55:50.340
No seekers, nothing, and horrible people,
but it worked and it cleared.

00:55:50.365 --> 00:55:55.680
So one person can get so many sahaja yogis,
why not you people do the same

00:55:55.705 --> 00:55:57.624
and talk about it.

00:55:57.649 --> 00:56:06.594
Your behaviour, your style, everything will
definitely impress them.

00:56:06.619 --> 00:56:17.312
One has to work it out in such a manner that
you achieve our goal of collective consciousness.

00:56:17.494 --> 00:56:21.158
It is not only for sahaja yogis, it's for
everyone.

00:56:21.191 --> 00:56:27.886
So that all these calamities that are happening,
horrible things that are happening, will stop.

00:56:27.886 --> 00:56:31.829
Completely stop, I assure you, it can be stopped.

00:56:31.932 --> 00:56:34.364
Because you are always saved.

00:56:34.389 --> 00:56:38.955
So all people who will be getting realisation
will be saved.

00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:46.015
Why not talk openly about it telling people
that if we do wrong, if we are immoral, if

00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:58.206
we are cheats, if we try to oppress others
and we become so much a power of destruction

00:56:58.231 --> 00:57:10.038
then this collective disasters will be there
and I think we'll be responsible for that.

00:57:10.307 --> 00:57:15.366
Everything you take up, any subject you take
up, you don't have to start an organisation

00:57:15.391 --> 00:57:17.176
to fight it.

00:57:17.201 --> 00:57:23.764
But only your power of convincing people and
bringing them to Sahaja Yoga will make such

00:57:23.789 --> 00:57:25.435
a difference.

00:57:25.435 --> 00:57:30.066
I hope you will understand as a guru what
you have to do.

00:57:30.066 --> 00:57:39.785
As a guru there are so many things and as
your character, yesterday, as they showed

00:57:39.785 --> 00:57:48.856
how Lao Tse has written about the masters,
how they were above all of it, above turmoil,

00:57:48.881 --> 00:57:55.213
above jealousies, above talking loose.

00:57:55.269 --> 00:58:02.100
They are so great, they are the masters and
they will be the masters and you will be the

00:58:02.125 --> 00:58:05.725
gurus if you try to do that.

00:58:05.725 --> 00:58:08.332
This is what you have to achieve.

00:58:08.357 --> 00:58:15.409
I know some have achieved it, but most of
you have to achieve, with compassion and love.

00:58:15.436 --> 00:58:18.436
May God Bless You All
