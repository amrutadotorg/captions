00:11.389 --> 00:14.849
Guru Puja – Avignon, France
July 8, 1990

00:14.849 --> 00:27.560
In Sahaja Yoga the Guru Puja has a very different
significant from any other Guru Puja.

00:27.560 --> 00:47.780
When you worship your Guru, you are also worshiping
the Guru within you.

00:47.780 --> 01:06.560
This is not in any other Guru-disciple system,
because in you, the Guru, the master has been

01:06.560 --> 01:09.770
awakened.

01:09.770 --> 01:18.930
And so, when you are worshiping your Guru,
then this master within you is also worshipped,

01:18.930 --> 01:26.990
you respect it, you glorify it, you awaken
it, and you manifest it.

01:26.990 --> 01:38.400
This, we have to realize that in Sahaja Yoga,
if you are a Sahaja Yogi.

01:38.400 --> 01:52.520
Now, the quality of Guru first and foremost
is that he makes you meet God, means he raises

01:52.520 --> 02:05.810
the Kundalini and establish the relation between
the All Pervading Power, and as your Guru

02:05.810 --> 02:12.050
is Adi Shakti, you make that person meet also
the Adi Shakti.

02:12.050 --> 02:20.950
So you have a double advantage, that at the
same time, when you give them Realization,

02:20.950 --> 02:30.569
not only that you make them feel the union
with the Divine Power, but you can make them

02:30.569 --> 02:36.080
meet the Divinity Itself, the source of Divine
Power.

02:36.080 --> 02:43.739
So your responsibility as Sahaja Yogis is
very great, because in you is - there is the

02:43.739 --> 02:44.739
Guru.

02:44.739 --> 02:53.580
Now in our mantras we say that, “Mother,
I am my own Guru”.

02:53.580 --> 03:03.800
But saying that, do we realize that, “If
I am my own Guru,” this “I” and “my

03:03.800 --> 03:09.520
Guru,” between the two, “What have I achieved?

03:09.520 --> 03:12.030
Where am I?

03:12.030 --> 03:13.790
Can I guide myself?

03:13.790 --> 03:21.250
Have I got the light of the Spirit on my attention
so well- established and manifested that I

03:21.250 --> 03:24.549
can guide myself and guide others later on?”

03:24.549 --> 03:36.550
First of all, in the Guru principle it is
important that you see to yourself the introspection:

03:36.550 --> 03:39.220
“Can I be my own Guru?

03:39.220 --> 03:43.959
Have I become my own Guru?”

03:43.959 --> 04:00.129
Now, in your case your Guru is a Mother, a
woman, so it has to be among women that the

04:00.129 --> 04:08.450
development of their Guru qualities have to
be very well manifested.

04:08.450 --> 04:11.689
But it’s just the way it is not.

04:11.689 --> 04:19.799
For them, they are still the mothers or they
are the wives or they are Sahaja Yoginis.

04:19.799 --> 04:27.450
But they don’t realize that you are also
the Gurus.

04:27.450 --> 04:34.779
Because your Mother is a Guru, because She’s
a woman and you have to be also of that quality,

04:34.779 --> 04:39.420
that people should say, “Look at this woman,
she’s such a Guru.”

04:39.420 --> 04:46.550
But still, as I hear from the different leaders
that the ladies are absolutely still very

04:46.550 --> 04:52.659
much far away and are very few who can be
called as real Sahaja Yoginis.

04:52.659 --> 04:57.630
It’s a sad thing to hear.

04:57.630 --> 05:08.890
Because if you still keep to all these mundane
things of womanhood and the drawbacks of womanhood,

05:08.890 --> 05:14.339
which has come out of domination maybe, because
of always they were shown to be something

05:14.339 --> 05:22.979
lower, especially in the Christian religion,
they were never regarded as something holy.

05:22.979 --> 05:30.399
They have this kind of a diffidence in them
that they don’t understand, that dharma

05:30.399 --> 05:34.830
can be established more by women than by men.

05:34.830 --> 05:43.610
And the Guru’s work is to establish the
dharma - in the society, in the family, in

05:43.610 --> 05:45.020
relationships.

05:45.020 --> 05:51.280
All these Gurus, which are representing all
these great symbols here, have done nothing

05:51.280 --> 05:54.390
but have established dharma.

05:54.390 --> 06:00.580
But first of all, before establishing the
dharma, we should watch ourselves, “Have

06:00.580 --> 06:05.300
we got dharma within ourselves or not?”

06:05.300 --> 06:20.260
First of all, the quality of a person who
has dharma is that he listens to others, he

06:20.260 --> 06:21.900
obeys.

06:21.900 --> 06:25.729
And this is something has gone wrong with
the western women, I think, that they have

06:25.729 --> 06:31.149
forgotten how to listen to others, how to
obey others.

06:31.149 --> 06:38.570
That’s why their children also don’t obey
them.

06:38.570 --> 06:42.469
Obedience, if you do not have, nobody’s
going to obey you.

06:42.469 --> 06:45.770
First, you must learn to obey.

06:45.770 --> 06:55.950
A person like Kabira, because he was born
of a unknown cast, people didn’t know what

06:55.950 --> 07:05.279
he was born from, and he could not go directly
to any Guru.

07:05.279 --> 07:16.380
So you heard about Ramana, great Guru of those
days, who used to go to the river Ganges every

07:16.380 --> 07:19.220
morning to have his bath.

07:19.220 --> 07:28.370
So one day on his steps Kabira kept lying,
and in the darkness the Guru could not see,

07:28.370 --> 07:33.400
and he touched him with his feet.

07:33.400 --> 07:34.470
He said, “Who are you?”

07:34.470 --> 07:38.500
So he said, “I’m Kabir, and I’m your
disciple.”

07:38.500 --> 07:40.180
And he got hold of his feet.

07:40.180 --> 07:45.050
And when he got hold of his feet, he said,
“All right, come along.”

07:45.050 --> 07:52.469
And then he became such a great saint in India.

07:52.469 --> 07:55.370
People know him more than they know his Guru;
he became so great.

07:55.370 --> 07:58.870
The basic thing is humility.

07:58.870 --> 08:06.940
Yesterday you saw how the musician was humble,
all the time he was humble, he didn’t know

08:06.940 --> 08:09.510
how to express his humility every time.

08:09.510 --> 08:18.630
All the time he was humble, because in humility
only you can receive the blessings, you can

08:18.630 --> 08:24.399
receive the quality that is of your Guru.

08:24.399 --> 08:35.210
Now, for a Guru as you have seen that in My
own way, in My own image you have to come

08:35.210 --> 08:36.490
up.

08:36.490 --> 08:40.250
First of all your life should be absolutely
transparent.

08:40.250 --> 08:43.870
Transparency is the essence of Sahaja Yoga.

08:43.870 --> 08:48.250
Everybody should know what you are doing,
where you are going, what is the way you live,

08:48.250 --> 08:52.390
what is the way you are behaving.

08:52.390 --> 09:00.300
I have seen people, who are Gurus, also in
the sense that we call them leaders, or we

09:00.300 --> 09:04.320
can call them sub-Gurus, or they can not be
called as priest, but I can say communication

09:04.320 --> 09:06.940
centers as they are.

09:06.940 --> 09:13.080
In them you find that they are very fussy
type of people.

09:13.080 --> 09:21.700
Always think about their body, always think
about their comfort, always grudge about what’s

09:21.700 --> 09:27.420
- nobody looked after them, as if they suffer
from persecution-mania.

09:27.420 --> 09:31.650
Or they will grudge about food, “I didn’t
eat my food for one day.”

09:31.650 --> 09:32.650
Doesn’t matter.

09:32.650 --> 09:39.830
For a Guru it’s better to starve for about
three, four days nicely, so that you get over

09:39.830 --> 09:41.820
this idea of hunger.

09:41.820 --> 09:47.980
You’ll be surprised since I’m here I have
not eaten anything much, just drinking something

09:47.980 --> 09:55.890
because just the Guru has no hunger, because
it is in your stomach the Guru - vibrations

09:55.890 --> 09:58.920
are so much that you don’t feel like eating
anything.

09:58.920 --> 10:04.260
So, then what do you eat and how do you eat
and all these things that we have given up

10:04.260 --> 10:06.050
to come to Sahaja Yoga.

10:06.050 --> 10:11.440
So even if leaders have this nonsense in their
head, “What do you get to eat,” I mean,

10:11.440 --> 10:19.180
this is the basics, absolutely, and when I
hear some people telling Me, “Oh, what did

10:19.180 --> 10:24.030
they eat and how did they eat” and all,
it’s like I feel they are like tourists

10:24.030 --> 10:26.020
in Sahaja Yoga.

10:26.020 --> 10:31.990
Just come in Sahaja Yoga like tourists, you
see, to see places and go round and to know

10:31.990 --> 10:37.500
where you get, in what restaurant you get
good food and cheaply.

10:37.500 --> 10:48.870
All this is so basically, absolutely not a
manifestation of Guru principle.

10:48.870 --> 10:54.120
Now you have seen your Guru as She is.

10:54.120 --> 11:00.360
I do not know what I eat, what they give Me,
what I want.

11:00.360 --> 11:06.650
They go on giving Me whatever they think I
like, and I just don’t know if I like that

11:06.650 --> 11:08.090
thing or not, or what is it.

11:08.090 --> 11:11.390
If they ask Me, “Mother, what will You have?”

11:11.390 --> 11:14.010
I said, “What will I have, I don’t know
really, what will I have?

11:14.010 --> 11:15.010
Anything.”

11:15.010 --> 11:20.660
So there has to be no choices, first of all
not to waste your attention on choices.

11:20.660 --> 11:22.380
Of course, only on vibrations.

11:22.380 --> 11:29.850
I mean, supposing, you go to a restaurant,
find all kinds of funny vibrations there,

11:29.850 --> 11:34.100
people are getting drunk or anything, then
of course you should say, “but all the choices

11:34.100 --> 11:38.360
must be based on vibrations and not on material
things.”

11:38.360 --> 11:43.490
That you get something nice there, “let’s
go there,” and they’ll travel for fifty

11:43.490 --> 11:46.160
miles to go eat something nonsensical.

11:46.160 --> 11:50.710
It should be all nonsense for all Sahaja Yogis.

11:50.710 --> 11:54.410
And when I said “Sahaja Yogi” it means
also “Sahaja Yoginis”.

11:54.410 --> 12:02.550
So the food part of it is aswadha, we should
not have any taste for any special food.

12:02.550 --> 12:10.170
Specially in France to say that people may
not like, but French are very, very conscientious

12:10.170 --> 12:13.840
or aware about the food part.

12:13.840 --> 12:19.160
I don’t know how far they make really good
food, but at least they think they eat very

12:19.160 --> 12:20.800
good food.

12:20.800 --> 12:27.930
So, the eating of good food is a kind of a
addiction.

12:27.930 --> 12:34.100
It’s a kind of an addiction; it’s something
like drug that you must have good food.

12:34.100 --> 12:39.560
So Zen started this system of what they call
the tea ceremony.

12:39.560 --> 12:46.490
In the tea ceremony what they did, I mean,
I have been through that and it’s really

12:46.490 --> 12:48.060
quite a test of people.

12:48.060 --> 12:55.110
With Me it was all right, but the rest of
them got really frightened.

12:55.110 --> 13:02.230
That in the tea ceremony whatever rituals
they do they give you a tea, which is so bitter,

13:02.230 --> 13:06.290
we can say quinine raised to power 108, it’s
like that.

13:06.290 --> 13:13.100
And they give you very nicely, handle you
with such ritual that you have to take it.

13:13.100 --> 13:18.350
So first they say, “You see the cup without
thinking”.

13:18.350 --> 13:21.640
So he tried to make thoughtless awareness
through the cup.

13:21.640 --> 13:24.940
I don’t know how much one can achieve with
that.

13:24.940 --> 13:36.310
But that tea that you take once your tongue
is good for anything.

13:36.310 --> 13:42.490
And to compensate it they give you something
sweet, which is again sweetness raised to

13:42.490 --> 13:48.880
power 108, so sweet that it becomes bitter,
so sweet.

13:48.880 --> 13:51.400
So this is just to conquer the tongue.

13:51.400 --> 14:01.550
Zen must have thought that better give them
this tea ceremony where there is no tea, there’s

14:01.550 --> 14:08.231
nothing but just you really give such shocks
to your tongue, so that after that you can

14:08.231 --> 14:11.260
eat whatever you get.

14:11.260 --> 14:16.570
And that’s why you must know that these
Japanese can eat anything.

14:16.570 --> 14:22.320
They have solved their food problem because
they can eat anything.

14:22.320 --> 14:30.180
They can just fish out some crabs or could
be some prawns.

14:30.180 --> 14:35.130
Just peel them out like peanuts and eat them
like that.

14:35.130 --> 14:39.950
I think Zen has solved this problem for them,
because they have food shortage and this is

14:39.950 --> 14:44.060
how they can eat everything, they can eat
the bark of the tree, they can eat the snake,

14:44.060 --> 14:49.570
they can eat the lizards, they can eat the
frogs, everything they can eat, so all their

14:49.570 --> 15:00.470
eating problems are solved in that country
by Zen, I think, because you have no taste.

15:00.470 --> 15:05.589
But in this I think the worst are, in the
whole world are Indians.

15:05.589 --> 15:10.870
They are the fussiest people for food, because
their women have spoiled them.

15:10.870 --> 15:15.290
They know very good cooking and they know
how to handle their husbands by cooking very

15:15.290 --> 15:16.290
well.

15:16.290 --> 15:20.520
And the way they cook food for them, you see,
the men have to go back to Indian food.

15:20.520 --> 15:25.190
Even if they travel the whole world, they’ll
need Indian food, they can’t get over their

15:25.190 --> 15:26.320
tongues.

15:26.320 --> 15:31.950
It is such a big conditioning in India of
food that I just don’t know how will they

15:31.950 --> 15:37.240
get out the absolutely the basics which are
important.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.589
Gandhiji tried that very much in the ashram.

15:39.589 --> 15:47.240
(Shri Mataji laughing) He used to give horrid
food, boiled food with the oil of mustard

15:47.240 --> 15:51.279
on top and then nobody could eat that raw.

15:51.279 --> 15:53.430
And he used to make everybody eat that.

15:53.430 --> 16:00.180
Not only that, he would make them clean the
bathrooms, WC’s, everything so that you

16:00.180 --> 16:03.589
get rid of your nose also, that you need everything.

16:03.589 --> 16:07.089
Because so many people you will, while eating
also in India will put something to their

16:07.089 --> 16:09.370
noses, you see they smell everything.

16:09.370 --> 16:13.850
So they are oversensitive to their tongue
and to their nose, but not to their eyes,

16:13.850 --> 16:16.089
to eyes they are not.

16:16.089 --> 16:23.010
For eyes I would say the most sensitive people
are Japanese and Chinese and also the western

16:23.010 --> 16:27.529
people are very much sensitive because they
don’t like to see anything dirty, filthy

16:27.529 --> 16:28.529
or ugly.

16:28.529 --> 16:38.330
Indians won’t mind any dirt, filth, anything,
just like dogs and what you call horses or

16:38.330 --> 16:42.170
buffalos, they can walk through any dirt,
filth, anything.

16:42.170 --> 16:48.490
Nothing matters to them, anything ugly -ugly
building or an ugly dress or anything is all

16:48.490 --> 16:49.490
right for them.

16:49.490 --> 16:52.340
It doesn’t matter, to their eyes it doesn’t
matter at all.

16:52.340 --> 16:56.940
Only thing kitchen should be clean and they
are all the time in the kitchen.

16:56.940 --> 17:00.490
So we don’t have to learn all these bad
things from Indians, there are some good things

17:00.490 --> 17:04.559
they have, but there are certain things – these
are very bad conditionings.

17:04.559 --> 17:07.850
And the next to that are, I think, the French.

17:07.850 --> 17:12.339
But if you eat English food you can become
quite good because there’s no taste in English

17:12.339 --> 17:26.300
food.

17:26.300 --> 17:32.670
So I have no problem anywhere because I think
I have no taste at all and I can eat anything

17:32.670 --> 17:37.250
any way it is cooked, it’s all right, I
don’t bother about what is cooked, what

17:37.250 --> 17:39.270
is not cooked.

17:39.270 --> 17:44.920
But if you have some French people for a dinner
in a restaurant they’ll spend 45 minutes

17:44.920 --> 17:46.530
deciding what they are going to eat.

17:46.530 --> 17:48.650
And, what a waste of energy!

17:48.650 --> 17:51.990
Forty-five minutes just to decide what they
are going to eat.

17:51.990 --> 17:54.050
After all what is so great, what you are going
to eat?

17:54.050 --> 17:57.440
It’s all there, just one thing that everybody
should have.

17:57.440 --> 18:01.650
So for Sahaja Yogis it’s important to give
up this idea, “I will have this.”

18:01.650 --> 18:09.810
First of all nobody should ask, “What will
you have?” - to Me also.

18:09.810 --> 18:13.630
I do not like people asking Me questions,
“What will You have?”, because I’ve

18:13.630 --> 18:29.200
to think about it and I want to be in Nirvichara.

18:29.200 --> 18:43.309
So, this is a one big ordeal, which we do
not understand, how much we are attached to

18:43.309 --> 18:47.590
food and food goes in the stomach.

18:47.590 --> 18:53.380
And not only that it spoils our Guru system,
but also spoils our physical system.

18:53.380 --> 18:56.640
So we should try not to look at food.

18:56.640 --> 19:03.070
That’s why fasting was told to the all the
people who wanted to develop their Gurupada,

19:03.070 --> 19:06.890
so that they should not fast.

19:06.890 --> 19:14.320
But they do not fast normally because they
think of food, so there’s no fasting.

19:14.320 --> 19:19.910
I mean, fasting means that you go into nirvichara
and don’t think of food, but they are all

19:19.910 --> 19:25.210
the time thinking of food, so it has no meaning
and you are just the same whether you eat

19:25.210 --> 19:27.180
it or not, your mind is eating it all the
time.

19:27.180 --> 19:36.220
Then you start thinking, “When will I end
my fast and know where will I go to have what?”

19:36.220 --> 19:41.350
So this is a very basic thing that we should
get rid of our habits, of our conditionings,

19:41.350 --> 19:45.680
“What we are going to have and what food
we are going to have.”

19:45.680 --> 19:53.170
Our children also should be given a proper
training about it that it’s all right, sometimes

19:53.170 --> 19:56.660
there is no salt, sometimes there’s no sugar,
doesn’t matter.

19:56.660 --> 20:01.040
And sometimes there’s nothing, doesn’t
matter, nothing important for a Sahaja Yogi,

20:01.040 --> 20:08.299
you can live without food for days together,
no problem.

20:08.299 --> 20:14.720
So for a Sahaja Yogi there’s nothing like
taste of food and hunger.

20:14.720 --> 20:21.840
There’s only one hunger is to be purified,
to be clean.

20:21.840 --> 20:28.040
This is one of the things that dirties our
mind, we should say, that we think about food

20:28.040 --> 20:33.610
all the time.

20:33.610 --> 20:38.220
Even in Russia I found people carried all
Indian things there, they were cooking all

20:38.220 --> 20:41.340
Indian things, and I am poor thing I can’t
eat anything.

20:41.340 --> 20:45.220
So they cooked, brought everything for Me,
thinking I’m an Indian, but they don’t

20:45.220 --> 20:50.020
know I am Zen, I cannot, I do not have sense
of taste.

20:50.020 --> 20:53.910
So one to get over taste one has to work out.

20:53.910 --> 20:57.240
It’s an experiment you have to do with ourselves.

20:57.240 --> 21:03.640
Unless and until we introspect ourselves and
do experiments we cannot rise.

21:03.640 --> 21:07.700
Because though the Kundalini is trying Her
level best, but your conditionings are so

21:07.700 --> 21:14.460
great that it cannot pierce through and cannot
melt you onto that Guru level.

21:14.460 --> 21:20.400
If you see the lives of all these Gurus, they
were married, they had children, they lived

21:20.400 --> 21:21.730
a normal life.

21:21.730 --> 21:28.320
But in their own personal life they were absolutely
detached people.

21:28.320 --> 21:33.950
So first detachment should come from food.

21:33.950 --> 21:37.750
And there whatever you like you just don’t
eat.

21:37.750 --> 21:41.230
That’s the best way, because already because
of liking something.

21:41.230 --> 21:43.400
Supposing if somebody’s fond of ice-cream.

21:43.400 --> 21:47.360
He must have already spoiled his liver, so
they give up.

21:47.360 --> 21:51.670
If you like pasta, give up pasta.

21:51.670 --> 21:56.750
If you like something else, just give up,
don’t ask for it and don’t eat it at all

21:56.750 --> 22:01.760
so that you see your mind will get little
bit detached from it.

22:01.760 --> 22:11.240
It’s very easy to achieve this detachment,
I think, if you work it out in a sensible

22:11.240 --> 22:12.240
way.

22:12.240 --> 22:13.300
Just try to punish your body.

22:13.300 --> 22:18.490
You see, if you are your Guru, you better
take hold of first of all your body and your

22:18.490 --> 22:19.490
conditionings.

22:19.490 --> 22:22.210
You have to treat your body with this thing.

22:22.210 --> 22:27.110
I am told many girls who have married abroad
are still making their Indian food and eating

22:27.110 --> 22:28.470
this, horrible it is.

22:28.470 --> 22:30.170
They should starve.

22:30.170 --> 22:35.410
If they starve for say about five-six days
or maybe eight days, then they’ll eat any

22:35.410 --> 22:37.200
food in any case.

22:37.200 --> 22:39.620
That’s why the fasting is given.

22:39.620 --> 22:44.820
So one should adjust oneself to any kind of
food you can have.

22:44.820 --> 22:50.820
And if you want to survive then you eat anything,
so just make it a point that you get rid of

22:50.820 --> 22:59.040
this very simple conditioning you have - of
liking the food that you want to eat and you

22:59.040 --> 23:00.110
don’t want to have.

23:00.110 --> 23:05.340
I think as Sahaja Yogini or Sahaja Yogi who
cannot get rid of this little thing, then

23:05.340 --> 23:09.050
how can you call him a Sahaja Yogi, I don’t
know, he’s very a-Sahaj.

23:09.050 --> 23:11.460
Because the other day I met one lady.

23:11.460 --> 23:14.140
I said, “What is the matter, where have
you been?”

23:14.140 --> 23:17.000
She said, “I’ve been looking out for some
sort of an Indian ingredient.”

23:17.000 --> 23:20.580
I said, “How can you get it here in Spain?

23:20.580 --> 23:21.580
You cannot.

23:21.580 --> 23:22.580
Why?”

23:22.580 --> 23:24.140
“Because they asked me to make Indian food.”

23:24.140 --> 23:25.140
All right.

23:25.140 --> 23:26.480
Without that can’t you make Indian food?

23:26.480 --> 23:30.880
What is the need to run all the way whole
day for a one small little thing called hinh.

23:30.880 --> 23:34.120
There’s a big name for that, it’s a small
little thing.

23:34.120 --> 23:38.179
Just to get that she had to run all over the
places to get it.

23:38.179 --> 23:46.230
So for people who are Sahaja Yogis if they
are Sahaj whatever is available you can make

23:46.230 --> 23:50.280
something nice out of it and eat it.

23:50.280 --> 23:58.700
So that shows what shows sagacity, shows strupti,
shows your satisfaction.

23:58.700 --> 24:04.460
And that is one of the manifestations of a
Guru that he’s a satisfied soul.

24:04.460 --> 24:07.170
He’s just self-contained, doesn’t bother.

24:07.170 --> 24:14.080
Now, for example, some people, specially in
the West, thank God, they are not spoiled

24:14.080 --> 24:18.299
by their wives so much, they don’t have
so much of conditioning, they can eat anything.

24:18.299 --> 24:23.630
I’ve seen that when they come on the India
tour, all the Indians say, “O, horrid food

24:23.630 --> 24:29.390
was given and the poor things were eating
that horrid food and this and that.”

24:29.390 --> 24:32.270
And I asked them, “Which place you like
the best?”

24:32.270 --> 24:33.270
They said, “Brahmapuri.”

24:33.270 --> 24:34.270
I said, “Eh?

24:34.270 --> 24:37.330
They were saying Brahmapuri had the worst
food and everybody is complaining.”

24:37.330 --> 24:38.330
“No, no.

24:38.330 --> 24:43.110
Brahmapuri was the best, because we could
bathe in the river and we could sing and we

24:43.110 --> 24:44.110
could enjoy it.”

24:44.110 --> 24:51.250
You see, that’s the sign of one thing to
get rid of your bad habits of food business.

24:51.250 --> 24:57.960
Now the second part is for the body you need
comforts.

24:57.960 --> 25:06.650
I must congratulate the Western Sahaja Yogis
that they may be coming from any walk of life,

25:06.650 --> 25:10.220
I must say, the Indians have to learn from
them.

25:10.220 --> 25:14.410
They may be coming from any position or status.

25:14.410 --> 25:21.320
All of them enjoy the comfort of the Spirit
when they travel in the Tour.

25:21.320 --> 25:27.370
They do not ask for, “ Why I haven’t got
a chair, I haven’t got a bed, I haven’t

25:27.370 --> 25:28.670
got a proper things.”

25:28.670 --> 25:37.490
In this way you see you will realize that
the body comfort is of no importance.

25:37.490 --> 25:40.890
It’s we have just spoilt our body, there’s
no need, no need.

25:40.890 --> 25:43.120
Body you put it anywhere will sleep in any
case.

25:43.120 --> 25:49.040
If you cannot sleep for two nights, all right,
put on some music for one night or two nights

25:49.040 --> 26:03.970
as we had here, you will sleep anyway.

26:03.970 --> 26:12.240
So this is the second point is that we have
to give up body comfort.

26:12.240 --> 26:21.970
But the third point where I think the Western
people falter is their materialistic attitude.

26:21.970 --> 26:28.179
Materialistic attitude and their fondness
of their eyes.

26:28.179 --> 26:33.780
So one of them is the worst of all, I mean,
the worst in worst of all is that you can

26:33.780 --> 26:40.780
never have, that’s such a big blot if you
have that is to have a roving eye and things

26:40.780 --> 26:41.860
like that.

26:41.860 --> 26:45.630
Out of question, that’s out of question
for women or for men.

26:45.630 --> 26:48.500
They are not Sahaja Yogis by any chance.

26:48.500 --> 26:54.020
They have to have very clean eyes.

26:54.020 --> 26:56.169
That part is all right.

26:56.169 --> 27:00.490
And the second part is the greed, lust and
greed.

27:00.490 --> 27:08.860
Of course, with Sahaja Yoga maybe the lust
part is over, but greed is still there with

27:08.860 --> 27:12.010
so many who get lost.

27:12.010 --> 27:17.330
So I would say Indians do not have this lust
problem, but they still have greed, greed

27:17.330 --> 27:18.330
problem.

27:18.330 --> 27:26.520
Means they want to buy something like a radio,
some electrical stuff they must buy.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.400
If they come abroad they must buy something.

27:28.400 --> 27:32.380
It’s all right, if you get it, well and
good, if you don’t get it, well and good

27:32.380 --> 27:33.560
- it should be.

27:33.560 --> 27:39.660
But for a Westerner, you see, he would not
like to give up his furniture, which his great

27:39.660 --> 27:40.660
grandmother had.

27:40.660 --> 27:43.840
Though he can’t sit on it because it’s
so old.

27:43.840 --> 27:45.480
If he sits on it will be break.

27:45.480 --> 27:50.620
But he must keep it to show off that, “I
had a great grandmother who gave this unique

27:50.620 --> 27:51.620
chair.”

27:51.620 --> 27:56.260
According to Indian standards it’s junk,
absolute junk.

27:56.260 --> 28:00.210
Because it is good for nothing you put it
in the drawing room, nobody can sit on it

28:00.210 --> 28:02.160
and it looks junky.

28:02.160 --> 28:06.280
But according to the western mind the older
it is, the better - whether it is a junk or

28:06.280 --> 28:11.520
it is a jewel, he’ll have so many junks
in the house and they will sell like hot cakes.

28:11.520 --> 28:16.220
Because there’s a very subtle materialistic
attitude towards matter that, “This will

28:16.220 --> 28:21.200
sell like hot cakes if I sell it because there
must be another mad westerner who’d like

28:21.200 --> 28:22.200
to buy that junk.”

28:22.200 --> 28:23.330
You see.

28:23.330 --> 28:29.440
So that this junk that you have in the house
is better to get rid of because God knows

28:29.440 --> 28:32.520
how many people must have used it, it’s
like a grave in the house.

28:32.520 --> 28:34.039
It’s a grave.

28:34.039 --> 28:36.940
So to have then also the antique jewelry.

28:36.940 --> 28:39.380
Antique jewelry is another mind.

28:39.380 --> 28:48.840
Antique is a - what you can say - is the fad
or addiction of the western people.

28:48.840 --> 28:49.840
Antique.

28:49.840 --> 28:50.850
For us nothing is antique.

28:50.850 --> 28:55.600
Because we still produce antique things, beautiful
things so Indians don’t understand the value

28:55.600 --> 28:56.600
of antiques.

28:56.600 --> 29:01.780
They don’t understand how these people are
so mad after torn things and broken things

29:01.780 --> 29:04.799
and dirty things and filthy things.

29:04.799 --> 29:07.919
But the western mind has been brought up that
way.

29:07.919 --> 29:12.500
And these antique things I have seen that
once I went to somebody’s house, you see,

29:12.500 --> 29:16.240
and he asked Me with very great honor to sit
on his chair.

29:16.240 --> 29:21.419
As soon as I sat on the chair I thought there
were snakes and were scorpions all biting

29:21.419 --> 29:22.419
Me.

29:22.419 --> 29:24.010
I got a fright, I got up.

29:24.010 --> 29:25.270
I said, “What is it?”

29:25.270 --> 29:29.900
He said, “This is from great, great, great
grandmother, you see, she gave us this thing.”

29:29.900 --> 29:33.730
I said, “It will break, I better sit outside.”

29:33.730 --> 29:42.030
So this also madness of this antique is so
much that it is unbelievable how people go

29:42.030 --> 29:43.030
into it.

29:43.030 --> 29:49.200
So there’s a joke in India; there’s a
very great writer called as Princhan, he wrote

29:49.200 --> 29:59.110
about two Englishmen going on the road of
Benares when they were hit by a lota, that

29:59.110 --> 30:03.500
they use for their bathrooms - fell on their
feet.

30:03.500 --> 30:10.669
And it fell on their feet and he jokingly
says on the feet where all the bureaucrats

30:10.669 --> 30:11.669
fall.

30:11.669 --> 30:15.160
Means, all Indian bureaucrats used to fall
at the feet of the English at that time, so

30:15.160 --> 30:16.320
he made a joke.

30:16.320 --> 30:20.169
But doesn’t matter, then the English, you
see, looked at that thing and they were very

30:20.169 --> 30:21.169
angry.

30:21.169 --> 30:23.920
Immediately they took to law, “You have
to come to the courts, you have to come to

30:23.920 --> 30:29.890
the police and we’ll going to report this
has fallen there, it has hit us” and all

30:29.890 --> 30:30.890
that.

30:30.890 --> 30:36.640
So there was a clever man, he knew the English
or the western mind, he said, “Sir, do you

30:36.640 --> 30:39.490
know this, this lota has very valuable.”

30:39.490 --> 30:40.780
They said, “Why?”

30:40.780 --> 30:44.970
“Because this one was used by Akbar the
Great.

30:44.970 --> 30:46.190
So ancient it is.”

30:46.190 --> 30:47.190
They said, “Really?”

30:47.190 --> 30:52.980
“Yes it is and, you know, you just don’t
quarrel with them and ask them for this lota.”

30:52.980 --> 30:56.900
And he told in Indian language to them that,
“I’ve befooled this people, I’ve told

30:56.900 --> 31:06.679
them that this lota belonged to Akbar and
you have to take this lota and use this lota

31:06.679 --> 31:10.610
to just to befool them.”

31:10.610 --> 31:14.740
So then they asked, “But all right, we’ll
forgive you, we’ll not take you to any courts

31:14.740 --> 31:17.580
or anything, but you just give us this lota.”

31:17.580 --> 31:19.380
They said, “No, we can’t.”

31:19.380 --> 31:20.460
They said, “Why?”

31:20.460 --> 31:22.679
“Because it’s such an antique piece, you
see.”

31:22.679 --> 31:27.050
In India you won’t find anybody respecting
antique pieces, especially in Benares nobody

31:27.050 --> 31:28.050
bothers.

31:28.050 --> 31:29.960
(Laughter) So they said, “Really?”

31:29.960 --> 31:35.549
“Yes, it belonged to Akbar and, you know,
my father was - my forefathers worked with

31:35.549 --> 31:37.680
him, so he gave us this lota, we can’t give
you, we are sorry, you see.”

31:37.680 --> 31:42.570
“No, no, no, no, please give us, you see,
and we’ll no take you to the police.”

31:42.570 --> 31:45.390
“All right, you charge us, whatever money
you charge us” and all that.

31:45.390 --> 31:50.290
In those days they paid one thousand rupees,
this is equal to now one carore, I think.

31:50.290 --> 31:56.500
They gave these English paid them and bought
that lota, which had nothing to do with Akbar

31:56.500 --> 31:58.610
or anyone.

31:58.610 --> 32:04.460
So this madness of antique has to go away
from our minds, it’s such a built-in thing

32:04.460 --> 32:08.450
within us, that we always talk of antiquities.

32:08.450 --> 32:13.720
Perhaps maybe because of wars everything was
destroyed and whatever was in the olden times

32:13.720 --> 32:17.970
was something very beautiful and good and
now we are not making very good things, perhaps,

32:17.970 --> 32:19.630
maybe that is the reason.

32:19.630 --> 32:22.620
But now we are making nice things, we can
make.

32:22.620 --> 32:27.630
Now in England I was surprised the old crafts
are coming up, everywhere I go the old crafts

32:27.630 --> 32:28.780
are coming up.

32:28.780 --> 32:35.830
So to respect antiques means you just stop
making the old craft revive.

32:35.830 --> 32:40.950
Because you pay so much to the antiques, the
same thing made today won’t fetch the same

32:40.950 --> 32:42.350
price as it was.

32:42.350 --> 32:50.500
Now this has ruined our creativity, ruined
our hand work and it has ruined our whole

32:50.500 --> 32:56.440
- I think the quality of our life, because
the way we are mad after antiques.

32:56.440 --> 33:02.049
So this also should go from your head that
anything antique is something good.

33:02.049 --> 33:06.950
It’s a - it’s a very superficial value
if you see to it.

33:06.950 --> 33:09.860
Because people I have seen think that antique
is something expensive.

33:09.860 --> 33:15.510
It’s just a marketing style that people
have felt that this is expensive, that is

33:15.510 --> 33:20.680
expensive, so it’s something great, to wear
something stupid and to say that this is antique

33:20.680 --> 33:24.130
jewelry and go about.

33:24.130 --> 33:29.120
I mean, God knows how many people must have
used it and must have worn it and what must

33:29.120 --> 33:31.440
be the feelings of that person.

33:31.440 --> 33:38.320
So we have to understand that this conditioning
that we have in our heads, that we must have

33:38.320 --> 33:45.570
something antiques with us, keep something
of such value.

33:45.570 --> 33:50.309
I mean, these questions never arose before,
so it’s not written in any books.

33:50.309 --> 33:54.720
Anyone of the books of the Gurus is not written
that, “Don’t care for antiques.”

33:54.720 --> 34:00.679
They have written, “Don’t drink, don’t
smoke”, all other things which spoils your

34:00.679 --> 34:01.679
Nabhi.

34:01.679 --> 34:03.180
They’ve written all these things.

34:03.180 --> 34:06.880
But they have not written that, “Don’t
worry about antiques so much.”

34:06.880 --> 34:13.809
You see, and I find that’s a craze nowadays
and so we have to tell people that we have

34:13.809 --> 34:14.809
to be careful.

34:14.809 --> 34:19.559
Moreover I feel the way people have gone to
drugs and that, maybe that because they used

34:19.559 --> 34:22.979
so much antiques that the bhoots from the
antiques must have caught.

34:22.979 --> 34:26.499
Can’t understand that why people are so
melancholy, all the time crying, weeping,

34:26.499 --> 34:28.769
and all that.

34:28.769 --> 34:36.419
So the conditionings of these matter as we
think it to be is to be absolutely taken out.

34:36.419 --> 34:41.269
Of course, I mean in certain countries we
should say that the antique things were made

34:41.269 --> 34:42.740
were good and nice.

34:42.740 --> 34:47.739
But only because something is antique should
not be respected because of its intrinsic

34:47.739 --> 34:56.119
value of aesthetics that – it’s all right,
but one has to see first of all the vibrations

34:56.119 --> 34:57.250
of everything.

34:57.250 --> 35:02.940
If the vibrations are good then you should
accept, otherwise not, because we have the

35:02.940 --> 35:10.920
language of vibrations and we have to use
the language of vibrations.

35:10.920 --> 35:17.250
Once you start using the language of vibrations
you’ll be surprised how you will get complete

35:17.250 --> 35:25.529
picture as to what is to be done.

35:25.529 --> 35:33.710
So to get rid of these three conditionings
too, for our body it’s very important, and

35:33.710 --> 35:39.160
the worst thing for a Sahaja Yogi to think
that he’s sick.

35:39.160 --> 35:43.980
Is a sort of a tarnishing the name of Sahaja
Yoga.

35:43.980 --> 35:50.079
If you are still feel you are sick you better
get out of Sahaja Yoga.

35:50.079 --> 35:56.609
Because either you get well or you are not
a Sahaja Yogi, one of the two things.

35:56.609 --> 36:01.690
If you are a Sahaja Yogi you have to see that
you get well and if there are certain problems

36:01.690 --> 36:02.809
also, doesn’t matter.

36:02.809 --> 36:09.530
Now for example, supposing, I have certain
problems which I know because of Sahaja Yoga,

36:09.530 --> 36:14.670
because of My position as the Mother, maybe
position as Adi Shakti.

36:14.670 --> 36:19.960
Certain physical things I have to face, parasympathetic
working I have to face.

36:19.960 --> 36:22.619
But I go through it, is accepted.

36:22.619 --> 36:27.289
You have to accept your body as it is and
you are not to sort of say that, “I’m

36:27.289 --> 36:32.220
not well” or “There’s something wrong
with me” and go on complaining like some

36:32.220 --> 36:34.430
old hag.

36:34.430 --> 36:37.150
Never think you are old, first of all.

36:37.150 --> 36:42.589
Never think that you have gone old or you
are no good.

36:42.589 --> 36:43.589
Look at your Mother.

36:43.589 --> 36:44.589
I never think that way.

36:44.589 --> 36:46.210
Yesterday half of you were sleeping.

36:46.210 --> 36:51.930
I was just still alert and listening to the
music and today I’m again alert here.

36:51.930 --> 36:57.530
So if you have a Guru then that image should
be with you that we, “Look at our Mother.

36:57.530 --> 37:00.690
She’s so old, how much She travels, how
much She does”.

37:00.690 --> 37:04.829
All right, you might say, “She’s the Adi
Shakti”, but little bit of shakti you too

37:04.829 --> 37:05.829
have.

37:05.829 --> 37:10.109
And that shakti is to be shown by your full
dynamism.

37:10.109 --> 37:17.759
If you have no dynamism and if you still feel
very weak that means you are not a Sahaja

37:17.759 --> 37:18.759
Yogi.

37:18.759 --> 37:24.160
So just ask for, ask for any amount of energy,
can come to you.

37:24.160 --> 37:25.710
That dynamism, it should be there.

37:25.710 --> 37:31.489
Now this I would say for the physical self
that one has to know that you are all younger

37:31.489 --> 37:37.089
and getting younger and younger, but not the
stupidity of youth, but gravity, the gravity

37:37.089 --> 37:38.809
of the age.

37:38.809 --> 37:46.250
Actually I‘ve seen children who are born
realized, they are very grave, they won’t

37:46.250 --> 37:48.819
do anything that is not dignified.

37:48.819 --> 37:56.049
And they will never, I’ve never heard them
talking to some of - the Sahaja Yoginis have

37:56.049 --> 38:00.119
a bad habit of talking tac, tac, tac, tac,
tac, tac among themselves, it’s a very bad

38:00.119 --> 38:01.119
habit.

38:01.119 --> 38:04.569
Which shows that they still very much lacking.

38:04.569 --> 38:08.400
Just wearing saris or wearing bindis you do
not become a Sahaja Yogini.

38:08.400 --> 38:09.920
First of all, what is the gravity?

38:09.920 --> 38:12.739
You should only speak whenever it is necessary.

38:12.739 --> 38:18.609
So I’ve seen these Sahaja Yogis who are
born realized children they stand like this

38:18.609 --> 38:24.579
before Me and they say very few words, but
beautiful words they speak.

38:24.579 --> 38:31.480
And say things, which you can remember all
the time - that you just do not go on wasting

38:31.480 --> 38:32.480
anything.

38:32.480 --> 38:37.390
And they’re extremely obedient, so from
them one can learn that these are born realized

38:37.390 --> 38:42.480
and the way their Guru principle is acting
- are we also acting the same way?

38:42.480 --> 38:47.160
Or we are doing something that is not good
for our ascent.

38:47.160 --> 38:52.440
So even after coming to Sahaja Yoga if you
do not try hard to introspect yourself, you

38:52.440 --> 38:58.019
have missed the point that you compare yourself
with your Guru - all the time.

38:58.019 --> 39:04.719
Then everything has to be understood in the
right perspective that we are Sahaja Yogis.

39:04.719 --> 39:08.609
Now for a Sahaja Yogi first and foremost thing
that he has to have love.

39:08.609 --> 39:13.650
First, for others, not for himself.

39:13.650 --> 39:17.960
If you are all the time worried about yourself,
“My body is such, my this thing such and

39:17.960 --> 39:20.930
I have to do this and that” then you don’t
love others.

39:20.930 --> 39:23.509
But do you seek to the comfort of others?

39:23.509 --> 39:27.170
Do you feel the compassion of other Sahaja
Yogis?

39:27.170 --> 39:29.519
Do you feel, “What have I to bring for them?

39:29.519 --> 39:30.519
What is missing in them?”

39:30.519 --> 39:37.009
Do you work it out, do you go out of the way
to help them?

39:37.009 --> 39:39.020
First of all Sahaja Yogis.

39:39.020 --> 39:42.400
Now Sahaja Yogis are different things.

39:42.400 --> 39:47.619
I’ve seen many Sahaja Yogis will go and
take the side of the non-Sahaja Yogis and

39:47.619 --> 39:49.749
try to debase the Sahaja Yogis.

39:49.749 --> 39:51.430
Is a very wrong thing.

39:51.430 --> 39:57.579
You belong to this new race and the people
who do not belong to this new race and if

39:57.579 --> 40:02.190
they are attacking anybody, these are your
hands, your feet, your head.

40:02.190 --> 40:08.450
And if they attack it, it is duty bound that
you help them instead of helping others.

40:08.450 --> 40:10.869
Maybe something wrong with this person, doesn’t
matter.

40:10.869 --> 40:13.619
You need not show all the fair play there.

40:13.619 --> 40:17.130
In that place you should support a Sahaja
Yogi out and out.

40:17.130 --> 40:22.130
Later on you may correct and you may tell
that person, “You should not have done like

40:22.130 --> 40:23.950
this, it was wrong”.

40:23.950 --> 40:28.869
So this dignity and this understanding comes
only through silence.

40:28.869 --> 40:34.859
But if you are chirping all the time, talking
tac, tac, tac, tac, tac, tac, tac, tac, it

40:34.859 --> 40:37.660
can never, never can make you deeper person.

40:37.660 --> 40:40.890
You’ll be just flying in the air with all
that.

40:40.890 --> 40:46.599
So for women now is best is to take to mauna,
is to keep quiet, just keep quiet.

40:46.599 --> 40:48.469
They all the time want to talk.

40:48.469 --> 40:53.329
This I’ve heard from all the leaders that
is a big problem with women.

40:53.329 --> 40:57.009
They just go on talking stories, telling stories.

40:57.009 --> 41:03.760
But if you ask them to come and speak, they’ll
start shaking.

41:03.760 --> 41:09.440
How many can give speeches - women?

41:09.440 --> 41:17.349
If you understand that if you cannot give
a speech, you better not talk also.

41:17.349 --> 41:21.170
You should be able to give a speech, because
your Mother is a woman, She gives speeches.

41:21.170 --> 41:23.799
Why can’t you give some speech?

41:23.799 --> 41:24.799
You cannot.

41:24.799 --> 41:26.829
If I make you stand, you will be shaking,
I know that.

41:26.829 --> 41:30.289
But if it comes to murmuring souls, you are
there.

41:30.289 --> 41:33.369
So that is one thing – women have to be
very careful.

41:33.369 --> 41:39.420
And as today is the Guru Puja I have to tell
you things not as a Mother, but as your Guru.

41:39.420 --> 41:44.359
That if you have to ascend the best thing
is for you to stop talking.

41:44.359 --> 41:46.390
Maunam sarvatha sadhanam.

41:46.390 --> 41:53.680
Maun means to keep quiet, is the - it gives
you all kinds of facilities, just keep quiet.

41:53.680 --> 41:57.559
If somebody’s talking too much, just keep
quiet.

41:57.559 --> 42:00.539
If somebody’s trying to criticize, keep
quiet.

42:00.539 --> 42:06.690
That’s your silence, that’s your right,
that’s your domain that you can keep silent.

42:06.690 --> 42:07.819
Just watch that person.

42:07.819 --> 42:13.390
If it comes then to answer, then you can answer.

42:13.390 --> 42:18.060
But if somebody’s trying to attack you just
keep silent.

42:18.060 --> 42:23.849
But this silence has to be established and
one should only establish by not talking too

42:23.849 --> 42:24.849
much.

42:24.849 --> 42:29.730
I’ve seen also when I am sitting here, I’ve
seen women talking among themselves and this

42:29.730 --> 42:31.049
is very wrong.

42:31.049 --> 42:33.089
You must learn the silence.

42:33.089 --> 42:36.880
Like yesterday I saw so many ladies also were
walking out, walking in.

42:36.880 --> 42:38.480
In the church will you do that?

42:38.480 --> 42:40.359
You won’t do it.

42:40.359 --> 42:45.089
In the church there is no Christ, there’s
a horrible priest sitting there, but you - you

42:45.089 --> 42:46.089
cannot do it.

42:46.089 --> 42:48.809
You all keep quiet, you sit there nicely.

42:48.809 --> 42:53.530
I’ve never seen anybody walking out here
and there and doing all kinds of things, putting

42:53.530 --> 42:56.220
the children in front like that, making them
sleep.

42:56.220 --> 42:57.220
Never.

42:57.220 --> 43:01.950
Can you do that in the church?

43:01.950 --> 43:06.549
What a discipline people observe in that church,
which is an artificial place.

43:06.549 --> 43:12.719
And where you are now, that kind of a silence
has to be there and that kind of understanding,

43:12.719 --> 43:15.160
that depth, that awe has to be there.

43:15.160 --> 43:19.910
But because we have not yet developed that
Guru, if we have developed it then immediately

43:19.910 --> 43:25.099
it will work out, you’ll see your gravity
will show in your behavior.

43:25.099 --> 43:36.759
So this is for - our attention not to be wasted.

43:36.759 --> 43:42.200
To discuss somebody, to discuss about others’
characters we have no business.

43:42.200 --> 43:45.599
Do we discuss the character of one hand to
another hand?

43:45.599 --> 43:50.420
To discuss about what has happened about marriages,
things like that.

43:50.420 --> 43:55.170
Also marriage is just - in Sahaja Yoga it’s
not such an important thing.

43:55.170 --> 43:57.390
Some people pay too much attention to marriage,
you see.

43:57.390 --> 43:58.780
A marriage becomes a headache.

43:58.780 --> 44:00.969
Also then, “What about my marriage?”

44:00.969 --> 44:04.239
Then again ten minutes you see that person,
“What about my marriage?”

44:04.239 --> 44:06.029
Again after ten minutes, “What about my
marriage?”

44:06.029 --> 44:07.269
You want to run away.

44:07.269 --> 44:12.670
I mean, you see, it’s something becomes
like a mania for people, “What should we

44:12.670 --> 44:13.670
do?”

44:13.670 --> 44:17.719
And the whole thing is all depends, and the
whole programming depends on how you are going

44:17.719 --> 44:19.160
to get married.

44:19.160 --> 44:26.339
So you have come to Sahaja Yoga, you are Sanyasis.

44:26.339 --> 44:32.450
You are not married people in a way, you are
married only to Sahaja Yoga, that’s your

44:32.450 --> 44:34.200
husband, that’s your wife.

44:34.200 --> 44:37.969
And the so-called husband and wife are there.

44:37.969 --> 44:42.709
But if they are not Sahaja Yogis then you
are unmarried, definitely.

44:42.709 --> 44:45.980
So too much attention is paid in Sahaja Yoga
to marriages.

44:45.980 --> 44:53.859
I’ve seen that before, before marriage - before
Sahaja Yoga, marriage was a joke.

44:53.859 --> 45:00.979
Every third day there was a divorce and people
would run away and do all kinds of things.

45:00.979 --> 45:06.729
Then when they got married after Sahaja Yoga
they are the greatest romantic people ever

45:06.729 --> 45:08.230
known in the whole world.

45:08.230 --> 45:12.059
I mean, all Romeo and Juliets going about,
I just don’t understand.

45:12.059 --> 45:15.789
Even in the Indian villages people complain
that, “What sort of these people are?

45:15.789 --> 45:20.289
I mean, they have no sense at all and the
way they go round, are they the saints?”

45:20.289 --> 45:29.990
So that saintliness, that sanyasta, that asceticism
has to be expressed in our married life.

45:29.990 --> 45:35.910
I don’t mean that you don’t have relationship
with your husband but in a very private way.

45:35.910 --> 45:42.009
It’s has to be extremely private and it
should not be such a great thing to go into

45:42.009 --> 45:43.009
romanticism.

45:43.009 --> 45:47.539
You’ll ruin the whole of Sahaja Yoga in
the West if you start doing that nonsense.

45:47.539 --> 45:53.219
Because also there’s an idea about it that,
you see, you fall in love.

45:53.219 --> 45:55.640
But then you’ll fall, that’s the first
point is.

45:55.640 --> 45:58.049
You’ll fall, you won’t to rise.

45:58.049 --> 46:03.589
So this attachment and this worry about the
husband and this and that, I mean, you can

46:03.589 --> 46:07.109
carry on with any kind of a husband and wife
if you are a Sahaja Yogi, should be able to.

46:07.109 --> 46:09.569
I mean, I know that’s very simple.

46:09.569 --> 46:13.800
It’s, your husband is a study, wife is a
study, that’s all.

46:13.800 --> 46:16.109
You study a person, what sort of a person
is.

46:16.109 --> 46:20.680
But for that you have to have the witness
state and you have to see, you have to be

46:20.680 --> 46:21.680
detached.

46:21.680 --> 46:24.950
So in marriages one has to be detached.

46:24.950 --> 46:30.140
But on the contrary I find that just after
the marriage they want to organize some special

46:30.140 --> 46:36.089
thing for them to go to some sort of a honeymoon
or some sort of a thing.

46:36.089 --> 46:39.410
I don’t know how these ideas crawl up.

46:39.410 --> 46:44.099
These are coming from the old conditionings
of things and after honeymoon they come and

46:44.099 --> 46:46.029
say, “Mother, this marriage is not going
to work out.”

46:46.029 --> 46:50.740
So it’s better to do slow and steady and
then decide.

46:50.740 --> 46:54.789
Because you just jump into honeymoon mood
and come back and say, “Mother, this I have,

46:54.789 --> 46:58.261
I have started thinking and I don’t think.”

46:58.261 --> 47:04.829
I know of a lady who was jumping with a Indian
gentleman and she was on her way to Australia

47:04.829 --> 47:08.900
in Singapore, she telephones that, “Mother,
I don’t think this marriage will work out.”

47:08.900 --> 47:13.589
And here everybody complain to Me, “Mother,
these two are behaving in such a manner that

47:13.589 --> 47:16.969
Indians are rather embarrassed.”

47:16.969 --> 47:20.599
So the sense of shame you must learn from
Indians.

47:20.599 --> 47:26.039
They never, husband and wife, never sit together
in India, is regarded as bad manners and it

47:26.039 --> 47:27.839
should be with you also.

47:27.839 --> 47:33.579
That even in the Puja, even in anything they
are sitting in the public, what is the need

47:33.579 --> 47:36.469
to show your relationship in the public?

47:36.469 --> 47:38.329
It’s only in the private.

47:38.329 --> 47:44.390
This is one of the things one if you start
understanding, there will be a proper adjustment.

47:44.390 --> 47:50.829
Men should be with men in the public, women
should be with the women together.

47:50.829 --> 48:00.009
But the women or men, whatever they are, whatever
are their bad, bad points should not be brought

48:00.009 --> 48:01.009
back.

48:01.009 --> 48:09.249
Like, I would say the men have jealousies
and they have power orientation and they discuss

48:09.249 --> 48:15.099
about leadership and they every, they get
a shock if you tell them that you are not

48:15.099 --> 48:19.289
going to be a leader, as if they think leadership
is something very concrete.

48:19.289 --> 48:23.891
It’s the greatest myth ever going, is this
leadership.

48:23.891 --> 48:28.961
There’s nothing like leaders in this Sahaja
Yoga, it’s just a joke.

48:28.961 --> 48:32.260
And your Mother is very good at playing serious
jokes.

48:32.260 --> 48:38.360
So be careful - don’t be childish about
it, you have to understand that this is a

48:38.360 --> 48:45.849
big joke going on and it’s just a testing
point and if I test you wrong, you can tell

48:45.849 --> 48:50.410
Me, but I think this has worked well, because
I can test people very well on that level

48:50.410 --> 48:54.739
and immediately I know when the person gets
onto the horse of ego.

48:54.739 --> 49:02.900
So, for your mental attitude has to be different
and our priorities have to change.

49:02.900 --> 49:05.449
Our priorities have to change.

49:05.449 --> 49:07.019
What are our priorities?

49:07.019 --> 49:11.369
First and foremost thing is our ascent, is
the first priority.

49:11.369 --> 49:15.059
For our ascent whatever is needed has to be
done.

49:15.059 --> 49:17.119
If you have to punish your whole body, all
right.

49:17.119 --> 49:19.660
If you have to punish yourself, all right.

49:19.660 --> 49:23.420
If you have a conditioning, get rid of it.

49:23.420 --> 49:29.329
Just introspect yourself, that is Self Realization,
is to know yourself.

49:29.329 --> 49:36.630
When you know yourself and know what is clinging
onto it, just to remove it completely, work

49:36.630 --> 49:39.730
it out the way you like, work it out the way
you like.

49:39.730 --> 49:55.079
You see, it is very important that the body,
mind, everything should be your slaves.

49:55.079 --> 49:59.880
Nothing should dominate you; you should be
on top of everything.

49:59.880 --> 50:02.839
How dare your body ask for anything?

50:02.839 --> 50:05.950
How dare your mind tell you anything?

50:05.950 --> 50:07.890
How this conditioning works on you?

50:07.890 --> 50:10.670
“I am a Sahaja Yogi, I’m above everything.”

50:10.670 --> 50:16.209
Like the lotuses come out of the ponds, you
have come out of it.

50:16.209 --> 50:22.099
We have so many proofs to show that you are
realized souls.

50:22.099 --> 50:26.549
I’ll show you some photographs that I have
to show that there is light.

50:26.549 --> 50:29.809
I can put light into you, they are all enlightened.

50:29.809 --> 50:34.089
But in My presence if you become the light,
you must carry the light also.

50:34.089 --> 50:36.979
Not only in My presence, but when you go out.

50:36.979 --> 50:41.920
But one of the reasons, I think, when I tell
something people just start thinking about

50:41.920 --> 50:45.319
whom Mother is talking, they never think,
“She’s talking about me”.

50:45.319 --> 50:50.880
That’s the only way you can penetrate within
yourself and you see that, “Mother is talking

50:50.880 --> 50:54.890
about me, She’s correcting me all over and
She’s telling me.”

50:54.890 --> 50:59.509
Then only it will penetrate and it will work
out.

50:59.509 --> 51:04.920
The priorities have to be changed and the
first and foremost is your ascent, and the

51:04.920 --> 51:06.489
Spirit, and Sahaja Yoga.

51:06.489 --> 51:13.670
The rest is negligible, nothing important.

51:13.670 --> 51:22.989
Then the faith that there is this All Pervading
Power, which is looking after us, is very

51:22.989 --> 51:25.390
important.

51:25.390 --> 51:29.829
This time the musicians came all the way,
I must tell you the story of their travel.

51:29.829 --> 51:34.630
They came and they said that there’s a train
from Kiev and they also bought the tickets

51:34.630 --> 51:40.130
so got into the train and they were off-loaded
before the Hungarian border.

51:40.130 --> 51:45.980
They didn’t know what to do, they had no
visas, nothing and not so much money also.

51:45.980 --> 51:46.980
They thought, “We are on the train.”

51:46.980 --> 51:51.440
Said, “No, you have to go cross over and
go to Budapest”, and they didn’t know

51:51.440 --> 51:53.920
where, they were standing on the road.

51:53.920 --> 51:59.650
And, but they were all laughing and enjoying”,
must be something in store for us.”

51:59.650 --> 52:03.809
Nobody felt that they were in trouble or in
anything, so surrendered.

52:03.809 --> 52:07.280
“So suddenly, – they said, – the custom
people came and surrounded them and they said,

52:07.280 --> 52:12.000
“What’s the matter, how are you here with
all these bags and baggages?”

52:12.000 --> 52:13.619
So they said, “Why are you here?”

52:13.619 --> 52:17.780
They said, “We have come for a concert and
this, and musicians we are and all.”

52:17.780 --> 52:20.290
And some or other they started melting away.

52:20.290 --> 52:22.079
And then they gave them Realization.

52:22.079 --> 52:24.140
Six of them got Realization.

52:24.140 --> 52:26.349
Now can you believe the power of love.

52:26.349 --> 52:32.339
And the custom officers they offered their
own cars, took them down to the other side.

52:32.339 --> 52:34.940
It’s never happened with custom officers
- imagine.

52:34.940 --> 52:39.549
It would be like shaving their teeth off,
I tell you, the way (Shri Mataji laughing)

52:39.549 --> 52:45.640
if you can do that to the custom officer,
but it happened.

52:45.640 --> 52:48.450
And they came to the other side and left them
there.

52:48.450 --> 52:52.650
Now they didn’t know what to do, they wanted
to go to Budapest, they had to walk about

52:52.650 --> 52:55.190
two miles or something to the station.

52:55.190 --> 53:01.609
So they waiting there well, they said that,
“Mother, You sent maybe two Yugoslavs came

53:01.609 --> 53:05.680
in a big bus of 49 people - all vacant.

53:05.680 --> 53:09.390
They stopped the bus and said, “What is
it, why are you here?”

53:09.390 --> 53:11.670
So they said, “This is our problem and we
have to go”.

53:11.670 --> 53:12.890
So they got into the bus.

53:12.890 --> 53:17.569
When he was driving them down, they thought
of talking to him that, “Why not you take

53:17.569 --> 53:19.160
us to Milan?”

53:19.160 --> 53:23.329
And they managed.

53:23.329 --> 53:24.819
And they were in Milan.

53:24.819 --> 53:27.380
It’s so remarkable.

53:27.380 --> 53:34.759
So to have faith completely in yourself and
in that Power, which is surrounding you.

53:34.759 --> 53:42.660
And once you have that faith you will realize
that though it is so helpful to you, it is

53:42.660 --> 53:50.660
so kind to you, on the same level if you think
it, it can be very harmful.

53:50.660 --> 53:59.489
So then never listen to the Guru ninda, means
anybody talks anything ill about your Guru,

53:59.489 --> 54:03.930
just put your hands to your ears, absolutely
immediately.

54:03.930 --> 54:09.390
I’ve known of a person who was - did that
caught cancer, and another now in jail, another

54:09.390 --> 54:10.390
one there.

54:10.390 --> 54:16.150
So anybody is saying like that just put your
hands, because now you know that – what

54:16.150 --> 54:17.599
is your Guru.

54:17.599 --> 54:21.579
So you should never hear anything against
your Guru from anyone.

54:21.579 --> 54:26.489
The other day one gentleman asked Me a question,
a newsman.

54:26.489 --> 54:29.670
He said that, “I am told You have made a
castle for Yourself.”

54:29.670 --> 54:33.859
I said, “I have paid for it, I’ve made
it also, it was a horrid place, no doubt.

54:33.859 --> 54:37.170
But there are only Sahaja Yogis staying there,
I’m not staying there.”

54:37.170 --> 54:38.170
That’s the best part.

54:38.170 --> 54:39.720
But that’s all I said.

54:39.720 --> 54:45.119
But on the contrary, they never go and ask
these questions to any gurus on anything.

54:45.119 --> 54:46.839
Because the disciples say, “Yes, so what?

54:46.839 --> 54:51.079
We want to give to our guru money and this
and that”.

54:51.079 --> 54:52.079
They never ask.

54:52.079 --> 54:56.759
But through Sahaja Yoga or Myself I have cured
so many people of incurable diseases, I could

54:56.759 --> 54:58.239
have minted money.

54:58.239 --> 55:03.390
For curing one cancer patient I could have
made a castle, Myself.

55:03.390 --> 55:07.150
So when people say like that you should say,
“Do you know how many people She has cured?

55:07.150 --> 55:14.519
How much money She could have taken from them
if She was a doctor or She was a false Guru?

55:14.519 --> 55:17.749
How much money She would have made out of
all of them?”

55:17.749 --> 55:21.410
Then they will understand, you see, because
they have been materialistic they talk like

55:21.410 --> 55:22.410
that.

55:22.410 --> 55:28.569
And their attitude is very different and so
to tell them off is the best way because I’ve

55:28.569 --> 55:36.059
seen that these press people are absolutely
harassed by the disciples of the false Gurus.

55:36.059 --> 55:40.900
Just they cannot criticize; they cannot say
a word against such false Gurus.

55:40.900 --> 55:49.759
While I find that Sahaja Yogis still lack
that complete faith in themselves and complete

55:49.759 --> 55:50.759
assertion.

55:50.759 --> 55:52.959
Where you have to assert, you must assert.

55:52.959 --> 55:59.420
For example, anybody says something wrong
against Me, you have to assert, must say,

55:59.420 --> 56:01.069
“No, not possible, it’s not!”

56:01.069 --> 56:06.970
But I’ve seen some people asking Me funny
questions for a Sahaja Yogis also.

56:06.970 --> 56:14.039
So the first part is that to see how much
we are sensitive to spirituality.

56:14.039 --> 56:19.420
I’ve seen Sahaja Yogis supporting somebody
who is so negative, you can’t even bear

56:19.420 --> 56:25.930
that person and - such a person is something
great, while somebody who is so good they

56:25.930 --> 56:27.499
cannot make it out.

56:27.499 --> 56:31.769
So what’s the use, your computer is so faulty,
you’ll do, I mean, the planes will have

56:31.769 --> 56:37.209
to run up and down if you have such a computer
as Sahaja Yogis are, because they just judge

56:37.209 --> 56:38.839
the other way round.

56:38.839 --> 56:44.150
A person who is good in Sahaja Yoga, who has
got vibrations, he may be simple, he may be

56:44.150 --> 56:48.849
unassuming, he may not be so rich, he may
not be so educated, may not be from some good

56:48.849 --> 56:54.640
university, is he anything, but you must see
the vibrations of that person, what sort of

56:54.640 --> 56:57.479
vibrations that person has and then you should
judge.

56:57.479 --> 57:04.309
Instead of that if you judge that person only
because he’s very good to talk and he talks

57:04.309 --> 57:07.519
well and very scholarly or something like
that, that’s not the point.

57:07.519 --> 57:09.390
The point is what are his vibrations?

57:09.390 --> 57:14.099
And once you see those vibrations and judge
them on vibrations, then you are a Sahaja

57:14.099 --> 57:18.519
Yogi, otherwise I would not call you at all
a Sahaja Yogi, but for a Guru it is very important.

57:18.519 --> 57:25.400
I have seen sometimes even the leaders supporting
somebody who is absolutely horrid; I can’t

57:25.400 --> 57:28.099
bear that person, even for five minute.

57:28.099 --> 57:34.430
But here the Guru sends him over to Me, “Oh,
Mother, he’s so good, you know, he donated

57:34.430 --> 57:35.430
so much money”.

57:35.430 --> 57:36.430
It doesn’t matter.

57:36.430 --> 57:37.900
You donated money, so what?

57:37.900 --> 57:39.680
Who asked him to donate money?

57:39.680 --> 57:44.459
But he should not donate his bhoots to us
now anymore, we don’t want his bhoot.

57:44.459 --> 57:45.709
So that’s what it is.

57:45.709 --> 57:50.779
So the judgment should be correct about a
person when you say that, “This man is not

57:50.779 --> 57:52.730
good or that is not good.”

57:52.730 --> 57:58.519
But mostly Gurus themselves are caught up
and then they have ambitions and if somebody

57:58.519 --> 58:03.029
doesn’t listen to them or somebody wants
to give a lecture at a wrong time and somebody

58:03.029 --> 58:06.589
says, “You shouldn’t talk like this”
or something, then they get angry.

58:06.589 --> 58:11.390
They are very hot tempered and they provoke
people, they say things sometimes and when

58:11.390 --> 58:13.789
people react, they say, “You are a bad Sahaja
Yogi.”

58:13.789 --> 58:15.049
That’s not the way.

58:15.049 --> 58:23.960
First of all a Guru or a leader has to be
himself a very mild, gentle, and a good person.

58:23.960 --> 58:28.990
He has to be in such a way he should not demand
anything, should not ask for anything, never

58:28.990 --> 58:30.329
demand anything.

58:30.329 --> 58:35.759
Anybody who demands can not be a Guru.

58:35.759 --> 58:38.689
Respect is to be commanded and not to be demanded.

58:38.689 --> 58:47.960
And so everything works out well if you understand
that once you rise in your ascent, in your

58:47.960 --> 58:53.779
wisdom, in your awareness and in your Spirit,
automatically all these things happen, you

58:53.779 --> 58:57.960
don’t have to ask for anything, you don’t
have to plead for anything, you don’t have

58:57.960 --> 59:00.359
to complain for anything, everything works
out.

59:00.359 --> 59:06.660
You are looked after by all the ganas, by
all the angels, they are there, you are on

59:06.660 --> 59:07.660
the stage.

59:07.660 --> 59:10.439
But if you are half faith then they play tricks
with you.

59:10.439 --> 59:15.770
You see, they play tricks, they make you falter,
you have problems, you go here, you go there,

59:15.770 --> 59:20.039
all these things happen and then you say,
“Mother, how is it this happened?”

59:20.039 --> 59:25.830
Because they are also jokers, so they play
jokes with you and they make problems for

59:25.830 --> 59:28.609
you just to make you understand that you are
doing wrong.

59:28.609 --> 59:35.249
So we are on a stage where there’s a beautiful
security, everything is there and we have

59:35.249 --> 59:41.410
to give to the world such a great thing like
Sahaja Yoga, which is for the emancipation

59:41.410 --> 59:46.849
of the whole world, as you realize, and so
also I hope you realize your responsibilities.

59:46.849 --> 59:52.799
There are so many things one has to understand,
how one has to be as a Guru, how he has to

59:52.799 --> 59:55.099
act and how he has to work out.

59:55.099 --> 01:00:00.420
Now I’ve given so many lectures on Guru
thing, but for today’s lecture only I have

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:08.859
to say that first thing to have a Guru system
you must have complete humility.

01:00:08.859 --> 01:00:18.640
Now, with Me, I would say, I am too simple
and I am Mahamaya, so you be very careful.

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:22.930
You cannot take liberties with Me, you cannot
take.

01:00:22.930 --> 01:00:28.509
If you try to take too much liberties that
means you are not a disciple.

01:00:28.509 --> 01:00:32.269
A disciple has to keep a distance from the
Guru.

01:00:32.269 --> 01:00:36.960
You cannot just take liberties, walk into
My room every time, sit there for hours together,

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:37.960
chit-chat with Me, nothing.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:40.670
You have no right.

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:46.450
Only when I call you, when I ask for you,
you should come.

01:00:46.450 --> 01:00:52.599
Then you should not force things on the Guru
that, “Please, come and listen to this or

01:00:52.599 --> 01:00:54.499
do this”, that should not be said.

01:00:54.499 --> 01:00:58.900
For example, yesterday nobody told Me there
are going to be these music programs or anything

01:00:58.900 --> 01:00:59.950
arranged.

01:00:59.950 --> 01:01:04.500
So we have to report everything to your leader
or to Me.

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:08.130
All those things that you want to do and it
should be really transparent.

01:01:08.130 --> 01:01:09.930
Like this hand (Shri Mataji shows Her right
hand) knows everything that this hand (Shri

01:01:09.930 --> 01:01:11.230
Mataji shows Her left hand) is doing.

01:01:11.230 --> 01:01:12.950
And this hand (Shri Mataji shows Her left
hand) knows everything that this hand (Shri

01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:13.950
Mataji shows Her right hand) is doing.

01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:16.970
In the same way everybody should know each
other.

01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:21.509
Then the Gurus should not have jealousies
for each other.

01:01:21.509 --> 01:01:28.529
It’s I’m just telling you because also
I found out that there are certain jealousies.

01:01:28.529 --> 01:01:34.670
And when they talk there is a little bit of,
“Ah, he’s good, but this, this, this.”

01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:40.329
When they enjoy each other’s company because
they have reached a certain state and they

01:01:40.329 --> 01:01:41.979
understand, “This is the state we are in.”

01:01:41.979 --> 01:01:47.789
When they each other’s company fully and
appreciate each other much more than anybody

01:01:47.789 --> 01:01:51.529
else - the Guru’s company.

01:01:51.529 --> 01:01:58.269
All the company of the leaders, if they enjoy
each other.

01:01:58.269 --> 01:02:04.009
And there’s no jealousy, there’s no fight,
there’s no problem but just the enjoyment

01:02:04.009 --> 01:02:06.619
of the company, then they should know that
they have become Guru.

01:02:06.619 --> 01:02:10.680
Now all of them never fought with each other,
they supported.

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:14.700
Actually it is one Principle was born again
and again.

01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:20.460
But only the satanic people they’ll fight
among themselves, not the godly.

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:27.939
And also they will talk against the person
who is a realized soul or who is an Incarnation,

01:02:27.939 --> 01:02:29.019
but never against themselves.

01:02:29.019 --> 01:02:34.759
It’s very surprising that the satanic people
though they fight among themselves, there

01:02:34.759 --> 01:02:38.349
are jealousies; they’ll never talk of each
other.

01:02:38.349 --> 01:02:41.749
But here I find that in Sahaja Yoga we have
freedom.

01:02:41.749 --> 01:02:46.579
But freedom is not abandonment, is the freedom
with complete rules and regulations of the

01:02:46.579 --> 01:02:50.970
Divine with us and we have to know them that
this is the Divine Law.

01:02:50.970 --> 01:02:59.239
So all of us are now sitting like in a big
vimana like an aeroplane and we all have to

01:02:59.239 --> 01:03:07.740
land into the beautiful area, but first of
all we have to develop that humility in your

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:11.179
heart - complete humility and surrender, that’s
very important.

01:03:11.179 --> 01:03:17.709
Unless and until you have that humility and
surrender in your heart, Guru principle can

01:03:17.709 --> 01:03:18.839
not be awakened.

01:03:18.839 --> 01:03:22.839
First you have to be the disciple and then
the Guru.

01:03:22.839 --> 01:03:25.410
So you have to develop that humility.

01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:32.009
And that humility comes very easily if you
love Me, respect Me.

01:03:32.009 --> 01:03:37.000
It’s not only love, but respect.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:54.869
That respect has to be there and then people
will respect you.

01:03:54.869 --> 01:04:13.049
May God bless you!

01:04:13.049 --> 01:04:47.699
* * *
***NO FINAL VERIFICATION FROM THIS POINT ON***

01:04:47.699 --> 01:05:47.449
Shri Mataji speaks about music performance
during a concert:

01:05:47.449 --> 01:06:52.759
This is a very, you see, pure raga and the
purity of it to be maintained is very difficult

01:06:52.759 --> 01:11:33.500
as he has shown here little bit here and there
to slip out in

01:11:33.500 --> 01:13:15.320
the playing of notes.

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:30.770
It forms another raga, you see, it’s very
delicate raga – like somebody says the path

01:13:30.770 --> 01:15:16.020
of

01:15:16.020 --> 01:21:19.580
God is like a very, very slim road.

01:21:19.580 --> 01:30:38.760
One side is a big, a huge mountain, another
side is a big valley.

01:30:38.760 --> 01:37:24.060
In the same way this raga is a - raga which
can only be taught by a very good Guru.

01:37:24.060 --> 01:38:26.480
And only can be learned very well by a very
good disciple, also.

01:38:26.480 --> 01:40:05.050
Because it is so delicate that slipping this
side or that side you just get into another

01:40:05.050 --> 01:40:37.130
raga as he has shown you just now.

01:40:37.130 --> 01:42:36.360
So the purity of it and this is the real beauty
of this raga is.

01:42:36.360 --> 01:44:16.140
I had heard this raga once upon a time by
a very great singer, called Roshnara Begum

01:44:16.140 --> 01:44:34.750
and the one he was singing – just I asked
My sister, “What is the bondage?”, because

01:44:34.750 --> 01:44:44.180
I remember the song, but didn’t remember
the exact words, you see.

01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:48.540
Just now she told Me.

01:44:48.540 --> 01:45:02.630
And she is another great, great singer, Roshnara
Begum, and the way she was singing, you know,

01:45:02.630 --> 01:45:12.560
as if the whole Puria - the whole building
of Puria she made it manifest – really.

01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:15.960
She made it manifest – the whole Puria raga.

01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:27.460
Say, such a beautiful thing and that is what
it is that here is a sign of a person who

01:45:27.460 --> 01:45:46.280
has done it so much with that purity of raga,
is the point - the purity of raga.

01:45:46.280 --> 01:46:23.260
And it’s very good for Sahaja Yogis to know
that the purity of understanding of that

01:46:23.260 --> 01:46:35.239
if you go a little bit this side, a little
bit this side you get away from Sushumna.

01:46:35.239 --> 01:46:36.239
* * *

01:46:36.239 --> 01:46:46.750
After puja explanation
(Sahaja Yogis show

01:46:46.750 --> 01:47:02.210
the miracle photographs and Shri Mataji explains)

01:47:02.210 --> 01:47:30.230
When the changes taking place, actually it’s
My name in Arabic, the changes taking place

01:47:30.230 --> 01:47:32.780
now.

01:47:32.780 --> 01:47:50.490
This is another one.

01:47:50.490 --> 01:48:14.760
This is My name, this one is My name in Arabic
language in the other, in other direction.

01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:46.611
Then it becomes, then it becomes Omkara in
other direction and Omkara becomes like a

01:48:46.611 --> 01:48:54.440
heart and with so many lines, there were no
lines, nothing.

01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:55.440
The lights become Omkara.

01:48:55.440 --> 01:49:10.460
Now, this is before the Puja they started
with the photograph.

01:49:10.460 --> 01:49:14.350
This is another series.

01:49:14.350 --> 01:49:34.810
So the music started and
the photograph started changing.

01:49:34.810 --> 01:50:15.489
Started going into different shapes.

01:50:15.489 --> 01:50:24.280
This one is easy languishes.

01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:52.310
The lights going into shapes.

01:50:52.310 --> 01:51:19.450
This

01:51:19.450 --> 01:51:21.410
is before that.

01:51:21.410 --> 01:51:58.040
Now they are writing My name, these lights
are writing My name, started writing.

01:51:58.040 --> 01:52:13.739
Now this

01:52:13.739 --> 01:52:16.510
is another one.

01:52:16.510 --> 01:52:29.950
How

01:52:29.950 --> 01:52:49.940
the form’s changing.

01:52:49.940 --> 01:53:55.720
Now

01:53:55.720 --> 01:54:49.290
see how the forms have changing.

01:54:49.290 --> 01:55:27.410
Here the vibrations are dancing.

01:55:27.410 --> 01:55:31.320
Vibrations are dancing, just see there.

01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:33.680
Then the Sahasrara.

01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:50.390
Then I disappear into light.

01:55:50.390 --> 01:57:36.340
One, two, three and then they all become lights
which show

01:57:36.340 --> 01:57:40.750
one by one.

01:57:40.750 --> 01:59:03.610
... These

01:59:03.610 --> 02:17:06.039
are

02:17:06.039 --> 02:58:40.109
the vibrations.
