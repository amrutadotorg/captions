00:00:02.484 --> 00:00:08.158
It's a great day today for the whole world

00:00:08.505 --> 00:00:18.616
that we are celebrating this Diwali Puja in America.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.140
It's very important.

00:00:25.672 --> 00:00:37.187
Here where people have been able to earn money,
to have lots of money sometimes,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:45.220
and are also people who are ruined completely because of money.

00:00:48.253 --> 00:00:55.410
When we talk of Diwali we should understand

00:00:55.468 --> 00:01:01.299
that why on a Diwali day we have all these lights.

00:01:01.778 --> 00:01:15.037
What is the combination of lights and the
Lakshmi who was born in the water,

00:01:15.354 --> 00:01:17.805
who stands in the water?

00:01:18.698 --> 00:01:21.674
Why this combination is there?

00:01:22.386 --> 00:01:33.898
She was standing in the water, as we know,
a symbol of prosperity;

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:43.622
 that is built in the human awareness that it can, he can prosper.

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:46.227
Animals don't prosper.

00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:55.573
They all have their maryadas, trees have their
maryadas, only the human being can prosper.

00:01:55.598 --> 00:02:01.225
But if they have no sense of their own maryadas

00:02:01.298 --> 00:02:07.754
then there's very ruinous, are ruinous for the whole world.

00:02:08.816 --> 00:02:21.035
So the lights are there that all the people
who have Lakshmi's blessings must enlighten themselves,

00:02:21.713 --> 00:02:27.210
 must have lights, and they should enlighten others also.

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:36.483
But actually, as soon as they get the Lakshmi
- so-called - they become absolutely blind,

00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:46.258
and they forget what is behind
the blessings of the Lakshmi.

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:54.982
First of all, as we see, how this symbol of Lakshmi represents -
I have told you before also -

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:06.520
 that a person who has Lakshmi should
be very generous.

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:14.327
One hand she's giving to others.

00:03:14.686 --> 00:03:24.674
A person who is miserly with Lakshmi is absolutely
against the principle of Lakshmi.

00:03:25.097 --> 00:03:30.424
And such a miserly person never can enjoy the blessings;

00:03:30.905 --> 00:03:37.696
 and gradually he starts becoming poorer and poorer.

00:03:37.902 --> 00:03:43.854
When you start giving with the left hand,
that means

00:03:44.012 --> 00:03:49.452
you have opened the door for your Lakshmi to come in.

00:03:50.014 --> 00:03:58.707
Then comes the grace of Lakshmi on you.

00:03:58.994 --> 00:04:12.318
And this grace of Lakshmi also has another
aspect, that you must give protection.

00:04:13.595 --> 00:04:25.341
Those who are people with money should protect
like this - protect who?

00:04:25.618 --> 00:04:36.645
Protect the people who are in trouble, people
who are having lots of cruelty on them,

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.241
orphan children who need your help.

00:04:41.828 --> 00:04:50.808
All these should be looked into, and the protection
to the people who are dependent on you.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.100
So this has to be done with the right hand.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.657
That's the symbol of Lakshmi.

00:05:00.086 --> 00:05:09.360
And there are two hands up there, which you
have seen, with the pink color lotus.

00:05:09.817 --> 00:05:17.240
Pink color lotus suggests that you must have
love in your heart.

00:05:17.424 --> 00:05:22.230
Pink is the symbol of love and compassion.

00:05:22.971 --> 00:05:32.048
As I've told you before also, a person who
has Lakshmi should have

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:38.357
a house where everybody's invited.

00:05:38.595 --> 00:05:47.734
Like the lotus invites all the insects, even
the beetles who have got lots of thorns,

00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:56.299
and the beetle comes and sleeps the whole night
very comfortably, and the lotus closes its petals

00:05:56.521 --> 00:06:01.782
 so that the beetle has no trouble to
be comfortable.

00:06:01.887 --> 00:06:13.238
So these houses must accept guests, any kind
they are, and they should be treated

00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:23.550
very well, just like as if the Gods have come into your house.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:31.542
I've seen people who are poor are much more
hospitable than the people who are rich.

00:06:31.636 --> 00:06:34.320
Same way about the countries.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:43.218
Countries which are poor are much more hospitable
than the countries which are rich.

00:06:43.308 --> 00:06:49.177
It's very surprising that rich countries have
their immigrations,

00:06:49.204 --> 00:06:57.489
 they have all problems of avoiding people,
 guests in their own countries.

00:06:57.581 --> 00:07:03.521
So they are going really in the wrong way as far as

00:07:03.546 --> 00:07:06.556
 the Lakshmi symbols are concerned.

00:07:06.783 --> 00:07:12.688
The another very important symbol is that
she stands on a lotus.

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:21.848
It's all glorified, all beautiful lotuses
carrying her: but lotus suggests that she

00:07:22.235 --> 00:07:34.071
throws no pressures, no imbalances, no power around.

00:07:34.404 --> 00:07:41.939
But in these countries where people have money,
they try to throw power all around.

00:07:42.069 --> 00:07:46.710
And one who has money becomes the more powerful person.

00:07:46.818 --> 00:07:50.448
Everything becomes power.

00:07:51.214 --> 00:07:54.997
Money is power, love is power.

00:07:55.568 --> 00:08:07.238
This power has no divinity in it, but a power
of oppression and aggression and self-importance.

00:08:08.061 --> 00:08:13.375
All these symbols of the Lakshmi are very

00:08:13.518 --> 00:08:17.890
convincing, that today when we say that somebody has got money,

00:08:17.915 --> 00:08:23.605
or some country or nation, they are just
the opposite of what they should have been.

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:28.340
The reason is they are not enlightened.

00:08:28.935 --> 00:08:37.253
They have to have lights in their heart, as
we see that in Diwali, there has to be the light;

00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:50.809
 and without enlightenment these rich
people, so-called Lakshmipathis, become nonsensical.

00:08:51.017 --> 00:08:54.526
That's why there has to be the light.

00:08:54.642 --> 00:09:02.571
Because with Lakshmi one can become absolutely
blind - so-called Lakshmi, doesn't give you

00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:09.851
proper understanding as to what it means that
you have got money, that you are rich.

00:09:09.892 --> 00:09:11.532
What does that mean?

00:09:11.874 --> 00:09:15.088
That's why one has to have the lights.

00:09:15.239 --> 00:09:22.947
Unless and until you have light of divinity
within you, you won't understand

00:09:23.365 --> 00:09:26.426
 the great symbol of Lakshmi.

00:09:26.619 --> 00:09:34.754
But in Sahaja Yoga we believe that the Lakshmi
must become Mahalakshmi.

00:09:36.563 --> 00:09:42.723
Man has to become greater, [SOUNDS LIKE MAHAMANAVA].

00:09:43.039 --> 00:09:44.693
What does that mean?

00:09:44.795 --> 00:09:48.706
That she has to become the Mahalakshmi.

00:09:48.828 --> 00:10:04.798
Mahalakshmi is a Deity which makes you absolutely
satisfied with whatever you have.

00:10:05.069 --> 00:10:07.235
Complete satisfaction.

00:10:07.378 --> 00:10:17.899
Not only that, but you start thinking that
"Whatever I have is not sufficient -

00:10:18.026 --> 00:10:20.699
 I have to have something else!

00:10:20.799 --> 00:10:27.809
Not money, not more cars, not more televisions
and things,

00:10:27.903 --> 00:10:34.570
but I have to have something else
that will give me real satisfaction."

00:10:35.688 --> 00:10:42.387
You know the law of economics is that you
are never satisfied.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:50.388
Nothing is satiable, so you go on buying from
one to another to another to another, another.

00:10:50.745 --> 00:10:56.983
But when the Mahalakshmi principle shines in you,

00:10:57.089 --> 00:11:02.224
then you do not want any more.

00:11:02.827 --> 00:11:09.924
You want to give it to others and you want
to enjoy your generosity.

00:11:10.178 --> 00:11:16.664
That is the first sign that you are moving
now from Lakshmi to Mahalakshmi.

00:11:17.053 --> 00:11:24.839
Till the Lakshmi principle, you were blind;
and whatever it was,

00:11:24.939 --> 00:11:31.204
you were more asking for more things
and more things, and more things.

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:41.120
After this is over, then you have the light
enlightenment.

00:11:41.438 --> 00:11:54.960
When you have done all the four things properly
- that is generosity, protection and hospitality and compassion -

00:11:55.570 --> 00:12:05.882
 then you get into another mood of movement

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:13.675
because you know nothing is satisfying, nothing is satiable.

00:12:14.024 --> 00:12:20.823
Running from one thing to another, then that
to another, that to another.

00:12:21.141 --> 00:12:31.721
And when such people get collective, they
start ways and methods of attracting people

00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:34.807
how they could extract money.

00:12:35.016 --> 00:12:36.656
There's so many ways.

00:12:37.243 --> 00:12:42.513
Like in our Italy when I was there, I wanted to buy shoes.

00:12:42.626 --> 00:12:48.014
We went to the shop and they had only one type of shoe.

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:52.434
That kind I don't wear, so said, "No."

00:12:52.459 --> 00:12:55.969
Now, "Only this year this kind."

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.020
"Only this kind?"

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:01.410
"Every shop will have this."

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:06.847
I said, "People have no sense, they have no life within them.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:10.810
So next year, you'll have another style."

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:18.271
Whatever is produced is always new, and these
shoes that were made last year

00:13:18.326 --> 00:13:23.921
 or before that are put into some sort of a junk.

00:13:24.725 --> 00:13:27.475
It's a very big business.

00:13:27.523 --> 00:13:38.266
So it is the big business that starts in this
manner, and many people become bankrupt,

00:13:38.375 --> 00:13:46.845
many people completely lose their dignity, and
fall into the trap of immorality.

00:13:47.947 --> 00:13:51.741
So this Lakshmi principle if you forget,

00:13:51.796 --> 00:13:56.515
 in a proper way you cannot go to the Mahalakshmi principle.

00:13:56.926 --> 00:14:09.407
And in the Mahalakshmi way you can find another
kind of personalities,

00:14:09.717 --> 00:14:14.323
because if you have the light in your heart,

00:14:14.379 --> 00:14:21.294
then you start seeing that this money business is of no satisfaction.

00:14:21.461 --> 00:14:25.946
You go on changing from one to another.

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:29.361
So then you think, "What should we do?"

00:14:29.504 --> 00:14:34.893
With this light in your heart, you find out that you have to follow

00:14:34.972 --> 00:14:41.115
now the principle of Mahalakshmi otherwise you'll be lost.

00:14:41.327 --> 00:14:49.358
So when you think of Mahalakshmi you start
seeking, seeking the way by which

00:14:49.413 --> 00:14:55.536
 you can really have a real satisfaction of life.

00:14:57.638 --> 00:15:02.728
I mean a country like America where people
have so much money and everything,

00:15:02.879 --> 00:15:09.398
 they have also the maximum number of seekers - maximum.

00:15:09.898 --> 00:15:17.366
When I first came to America I was shocked
that though there was Mahalakshmi principle,

00:15:17.517 --> 00:15:24.135
they did not know what to seek and they all
followed all kinds of false gurus.

00:15:24.613 --> 00:15:32.221
They had become mad, I think, because they
couldn't understand what is to befall be followed.

00:15:32.435 --> 00:15:39.845
For that they started following all kinds of false gurus,

00:15:40.614 --> 00:15:48.534
who were themselves slaves of Lakshmi - Lakshmitattwa - slaves in the
sense 'who were against' Lakshmitattwa.

00:15:48.685 --> 00:15:55.596
And that's how they all were lost, so many
of were lost in this country, and I was shocked

00:15:55.675 --> 00:15:59.961
the way they were following wrong type of
people I just thought that

00:15:59.993 --> 00:16:04.703
there's something really needed to be done to this country.

00:16:04.894 --> 00:16:08.818
And for nine years I never came to America.

00:16:09.064 --> 00:16:15.550
I am sorry for that, because the seekers were
moving in the opposite direction.

00:16:15.887 --> 00:16:23.823
They were not in the understanding as to what
the seeking is for.

00:16:23.929 --> 00:16:27.048
What are you seeking?

00:16:27.434 --> 00:16:38.606
Somebody came saying that "You are, I am a
sixteen-year-old and I can make you all realized souls."

00:16:38.712 --> 00:16:48.074
And I'm told that he put some vermilion
kumkum in a gun and blasted it,

00:16:48.146 --> 00:16:52.318
and people felt they were all, already have gone to heavens.

00:16:52.517 --> 00:16:58.457
Such idiotic behavior; how it came into their heads, I don't know.

00:16:58.712 --> 00:17:02.291
How did they become so idiotic, I can't understand.

00:17:02.692 --> 00:17:09.577
So I went back and I said: "I can't help these people much."

00:17:13.016 --> 00:17:16.804
Then a kind of another fashion started.

00:17:17.118 --> 00:17:24.368
Like if you went to any party or anything
they would say, "Now see, another guru has come.

00:17:24.559 --> 00:17:26.868
He's much cheaper.

00:17:27.115 --> 00:17:30.488
And But also there's a sale on."

00:17:31.053 --> 00:17:35.013
And I would say "Look at these women and men

00:17:35.147 --> 00:17:43.023
who are supposed to be the leaders of the world,
 and how can they talk like this?"

00:17:43.232 --> 00:17:50.182
It was a very common thing among the rich people to talk like that.

00:17:51.539 --> 00:18:00.242
This country has been blessed with very, very
great people, as you know, very great.

00:18:00.984 --> 00:18:05.176
Abraham Lincoln - what sort of a man he was.

00:18:05.206 --> 00:18:08.115
Or even say George Washington.

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:13.637
All these people showed the quality of Mahalakshmi.

00:18:13.662 --> 00:18:24.231
But they didn't much think of them, and they started working out
 a new method of capturing the whole world,

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:32.994
 because, then the idea of power came into their heads;
 that with money we can purchase everything.

00:18:33.564 --> 00:18:38.802
We can make everybody dance to our tune if we have money.

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:51.319
All this attitude towards money
and human beings was absolutely satanic -

00:18:51.466 --> 00:18:57.532
to such an extent that their own country started getting ruined.

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:00.841
What happened to the family system?

00:19:01.106 --> 00:19:02.754
What has happened?

00:19:02.859 --> 00:19:04.514
Why the family got ruined?

00:19:04.539 --> 00:19:09.740
Because of the wrong ideas about Lakshmi principle.

00:19:09.858 --> 00:19:14.401
The women got lots of money out of divorce.

00:19:14.599 --> 00:19:20.831
So I've met one lady, she had divorced
her husband eight times, from this country,

00:19:20.917 --> 00:19:25.185
now I'm told she has divorced the nintandh one.

00:19:25.303 --> 00:19:27.746
And she has become very rich.

00:19:27.891 --> 00:19:30.040
But she has no shame.

00:19:30.217 --> 00:19:38.156
And she is telling everybody that "Get a divorce,
 that's the best way, that's the advantage of coming to America."

00:19:38.324 --> 00:19:45.751
So what is the problem that human beings don't have enlightenment.

00:19:45.965 --> 00:19:53.279
And if they get money, and if they are hankering after things,

00:19:53.424 --> 00:19:55.755
they have to go to hell, no doubt about it -

00:19:56.082 --> 00:20:03.423
and do all kinds of things which was never done
 in the history of this world.

00:20:03.726 --> 00:20:08.177
I need not tell you all the absurd nonsensical things they do.

00:20:08.404 --> 00:20:19.793
Then started a negatives force of drug,
drinking and all kinds of things.

00:20:20.163 --> 00:20:28.772
I mean such blindness, such stupidity, that you can't understand.

00:20:28.917 --> 00:20:38.065
As if their brains were completely curtailed
 by the activity of moneymaking.

00:20:38.416 --> 00:20:47.252
I've seen people choosing their suits
and clothes that when they will die,

00:20:47.329 --> 00:20:50.593
what they are going to wear.

00:20:50.626 --> 00:20:52.950
It sounds funny.

00:20:53.065 --> 00:21:00.109
Even their dog dies they make such elaborate arrangements.

00:21:00.283 --> 00:21:09.517
They choose even their coffin -
which one they would like to use for burying.

00:21:09.801 --> 00:21:16.347
So with the money a new problem started, was the choice.

00:21:16.481 --> 00:21:18.696
What choice you have.

00:21:18.855 --> 00:21:24.223
And people played with that choice.

00:21:25.142 --> 00:21:33.070
They can befool you and tell you what is the best.

00:21:33.195 --> 00:21:39.256
I don't know why, but moneyed people are mostly idiotic,

00:21:39.651 --> 00:21:45.357
 if not very immoral. Idiotic, absolutely idiotic.

00:21:45.553 --> 00:21:47.864
Anybody can [INAUDIBLE] befool them.

00:21:48.206 --> 00:21:56.945
So, God knows what is the speciality that the people
 who are very rich can be very cunning,

00:21:57.068 --> 00:22:06.039
can be very immoral, can be self-destroying;
but mostly they are idiotic people.

00:22:06.173 --> 00:22:15.987
Because the way they talk, you don't know where to look;
what they say about things you don't understand.

00:22:16.246 --> 00:22:21.733
So then it's become the country of idiots and stupid people,

00:22:21.821 --> 00:22:24.225
and you don't know how to deal with them

00:22:24.287 --> 00:22:31.808
and how to talk to them about, about the higher life.

00:22:31.953 --> 00:22:39.712
This Lakshmitattwa has to become a much bigger principle,

00:22:39.823 --> 00:22:57.711
which we call as the 'emancipated personality'.

00:22:58.373 --> 00:23:04.573
Or we can say 'person endowed with Mahalakshmi principle'.

00:23:07.581 --> 00:23:13.771
Such a person may be cheated by others, may be troubled by others,

00:23:13.925 --> 00:23:21.958
but such a person has its own inner power
 to overcome all such hurdles.

00:23:22.465 --> 00:23:31.471
So this Mahalakshmi principle should be established:
but one would say "Why?

00:23:32.248 --> 00:23:38.182
What is the advantage of having Mahalakshmi principle?"

00:23:47.192 --> 00:23:56.308
When the Mahalakshmi principle comes,
 then there are nine Lakshmis which are described,

00:23:56.333 --> 00:24:04.204
navadha, nine, which get completely manifested in a human being.

00:24:04.696 --> 00:24:08.657
One of them as we call as Gruhalakshmi.

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:12.129
Gruhalakshmi means the family.

00:24:13.003 --> 00:24:19.446
The wife becomes a very wonderful person.

00:24:19.618 --> 00:24:24.791
She doesn't object to things, she doesn't react,

00:24:24.935 --> 00:24:33.554
 but she is very sensible and she builds  up
all her children in a beautiful manner.

00:24:33.869 --> 00:24:40.559
On the contrary, where she is not a Gruhalakshmi

00:24:40.646 --> 00:24:47.760
she takes pride in working out something like men.

00:24:48.066 --> 00:24:56.571
Means to her, her job is important, her bank balance is important.

00:24:56.805 --> 00:25:06.128
But the real bank balance of a Gruhalakshmi
is her family and her children.

00:25:06.637 --> 00:25:12.392
If she doesn't have that, she will be just

00:25:12.488 --> 00:25:18.661
thinking that she is very great,
she can complete with this man or that man.

00:25:20.888 --> 00:25:27.029
Women don't understand that their greatest capacity is to love.

00:25:27.606 --> 00:25:35.323
How is it that Lakshmi is a woman and all the Goddesses are women?

00:25:35.577 --> 00:25:41.193
And what is the quality of these Goddesses

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:49.737
 is to bestow blessings on people of their own nature,
of their own qualities.

00:25:51.900 --> 00:26:00.629
So to think that we are better off than men
because we have more money is the greatest idiocity.

00:26:01.586 --> 00:26:08.645
You may have money, but your children will be ruined,
your family will be ruined.

00:26:08.835 --> 00:26:18.928
When you make a good family, then you create a beautiful,
very beautiful, universe around;

00:26:19.055 --> 00:26:27.796
and universes after universes like this can create
a beautiful universe in the whole world.

00:26:28.356 --> 00:26:32.856
There's nothing to sacrifice, but to enjoy everything.

00:26:32.975 --> 00:26:41.406
As I said, you enjoy your hospitality,

00:26:41.671 --> 00:26:53.131
 you enjoy your generosity - which you do not
 feel is a misery or a trouble to you -

00:26:53.455 --> 00:26:56.407
but you just enjoy.

00:26:56.554 --> 00:26:59.293
At least I enjoy.

00:26:59.551 --> 00:27:04.925
If I can give something to someone, that's the greatest blessing.

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:13.578
So the idiotic people, they believe that generosity is stupidity,

00:27:13.714 --> 00:27:17.589
while they are the real stupidity.

00:27:17.738 --> 00:27:27.346
So to create a proper home for your children is a very great work today,

00:27:27.472 --> 00:27:30.048
 and it has to be done.

00:27:30.935 --> 00:27:35.432
Again there, selfishness comes.

00:27:35.992 --> 00:27:42.782
Human beings have so many, such hurdles in life because,

00:27:43.087 --> 00:27:48.404
I don't know why, he doesn't enjoy everything.

00:27:49.342 --> 00:27:56.821
So the selfishness comes in and they will only love their own children,

00:27:56.935 --> 00:27:59.902
 they will only love their own husbands,

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:04.350
 or they will love only their own wives.

00:28:04.488 --> 00:28:07.046
This doesn't create a good family.

00:28:07.141 --> 00:28:11.019
I am talking about the global family.

00:28:11.136 --> 00:28:20.660
For us everybody is a realized soul
and their family and our family is one.

00:28:20.898 --> 00:28:25.722
But then they will create problems, talk ill, gossip.

00:28:25.826 --> 00:28:33.433
I am surprised even in Sahaja Yoga
we have many women who just go on gossiping,

00:28:33.647 --> 00:28:35.957
 their style was gossiping.

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:43.395
Because I am talking about Lakshmi and Mahalakshmi
I have to warn the women

00:28:43.442 --> 00:28:54.741
because they are the ones who will create the great principles,
the great symbols of Lakshmi and Mahalakshmi.

00:28:55.172 --> 00:29:01.646
So gossiping is a very common disease even today in Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:02.056 --> 00:29:07.196
I've seen then [SOUNDS LIKE while inside],
 five or six Sahaja Yoginis meet,

00:29:07.329 --> 00:29:09.636
they go on talking, talking, talking -

00:29:09.661 --> 00:29:13.707
I don't know what do they talk - never about Sahaja Yoga, never.

00:29:13.745 --> 00:29:20.341
What they talk is 'what's wrong with another person',
 'who is a wrong type of a person'

00:29:20.394 --> 00:29:22.599
- that we call 'gossip'.

00:29:22.624 --> 00:29:28.637
And this gossip has created big problems for us in the collective.

00:29:29.473 --> 00:29:32.273
So best thing I would advise to keep quiet.

00:29:32.298 --> 00:29:35.442
Even when they come to my house they talk.

00:29:35.473 --> 00:29:39.895
They have no sense that they should keep quiet.

00:29:40.282 --> 00:29:46.783
Without quietude you cannot enjoy the cool vibrations of the Divine.

00:29:47.534 --> 00:29:58.587
Just go on gossiping and talking is not a sign
of very developed people in Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:58.836 --> 00:30:06.054
That's why the first thing is that women
 should become much more compassionate,

00:30:06.079 --> 00:30:10.985
much more tolerant and enjoyable.

00:30:11.493 --> 00:30:15.054
Because you meet somebody, they will start immediately telling you,

00:30:15.103 --> 00:30:18.985
 "That is wrong with this person, this is wrong with that person..."

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:21.120
But there's no need.

00:30:21.275 --> 00:30:25.119
But they will only come and give you bad news - all kinds.

00:30:25.162 --> 00:30:31.281
But they enjoy, giving the bad news,
that they think they are very important.

00:30:31.741 --> 00:30:39.934
And when they think they are important,
they can be very dangerous people, very dangerous.

00:30:42.398 --> 00:30:49.726
 Because I think it's the women who have to work
 it out much more than men,

00:30:50.408 --> 00:30:53.810
 to understand the value of Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:54.265 --> 00:30:58.108
Because their own children are concerned,

00:30:58.253 --> 00:31:02.940
their family is one of the units of Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:03.073 --> 00:31:07.374
I am saying this because now I have been noticing it very common,

00:31:07.407 --> 00:31:17.126
 that the women in Sahaja Yoga are not up to the point
 as they should have been.

00:31:17.667 --> 00:31:19.805
They gossip too much.

00:31:19.994 --> 00:31:25.810
So they should take to mauna I think,
take to complete silence, not talk.

00:31:26.191 --> 00:31:36.331
Those who are really very much effective,
who are doing the great work, are always quiet.

00:31:36.481 --> 00:31:37.994
They don't talk.

00:31:38.039 --> 00:31:43.232
I have seen they don't even come and see me, just recede back,

00:31:43.666 --> 00:31:51.876
while the women who think they are something special -
 they are the most dangerous.

00:31:51.908 --> 00:32:04.714
So the power of Lakshmi that actually first falls
on the shoulder of women should be Mahalakshmi's.

00:32:04.993 --> 00:32:20.355
And this one is, is a challenge to all the Sahaja Yoginis
to behave themselves,

00:32:20.718 --> 00:32:27.021
and to become greater women than all the
 rest of the women of the world.

00:32:27.159 --> 00:32:32.326
We have some very, very good, very great Sahaja Yoginis, no doubt.

00:32:32.351 --> 00:32:39.745
But their style is different,
and they are working out things in such a manner

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:42.913
 that it's absolutely adorable.

00:32:43.119 --> 00:32:46.143
They are just working for Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:46.237 --> 00:32:52.872
They do not bother about their personal relationships,
or their personal eminence,

00:32:52.983 --> 00:32:57.863
they just want to help Sahaja Yoga in every way.

00:32:59.102 --> 00:33:03.501
Then there is another Lakshmi called as Gajalakshmi.

00:33:03.856 --> 00:33:07.052
Actually it means Gaja means elephant.

00:33:07.428 --> 00:33:14.081
What is the quality of an elephant is that
the elephant walks with a certain gait,

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:17.898
which is the movement on both the sides.

00:33:18.103 --> 00:33:27.165
As I've said you, I've seen people, especially women,
who walk like horses, really -

00:33:27.498 --> 00:33:29.581
they just walk like horses.

00:33:29.606 --> 00:33:40.425
So once a dance teacher told me,
"Should I start, Mother, a dance school?"

00:33:40.661 --> 00:33:44.041
I said, "Better start a dance school, doesn't matter.

00:33:44.143 --> 00:33:50.003
But are you sure you can teach them to dance
 or they will be just galloping?"

00:33:50.145 --> 00:33:51.502
"Why?"

00:33:51.588 --> 00:33:57.447
"Because what I've seen of women here that
they walk like horses, I must say.

00:33:57.610 --> 00:34:04.812
How can these women who walk like horses can
[laughs] can do dance, Indian dance specially.

00:34:04.837 --> 00:34:06.439
It's very difficult."

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:12.776
So, now we have to see what is the gait, how you walk.

00:34:13.681 --> 00:34:19.615
Do you walk like an elephant, or you walk like a horse?

00:34:19.761 --> 00:34:25.896
Especially for men, men should not walk like elephant
but should walk like horses, all right.

00:34:30.252 --> 00:34:35.573
But the worst thing that has happened is that men dress up like women

00:34:35.598 --> 00:34:37.711
and women dress up like man.

00:34:37.736 --> 00:34:39.370
Now what to do?

00:34:39.395 --> 00:34:46.742
Why this kind of a mad transformation taking place?

00:34:46.773 --> 00:34:50.493
Why do they take to such things?

00:34:50.535 --> 00:35:03.419
For, what is the advantage of becoming a woman
when he is a man, and a woman becoming a man?

00:35:03.455 --> 00:35:09.515
That is the reason, it which shows, that they
want to have some change -

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:11.445
 some change is important.

00:35:11.735 --> 00:35:15.825
You'd like to change your dress,
you'd like to change your houses,

00:35:15.848 --> 00:35:18.660
even your sexes you want to change.

00:35:18.685 --> 00:35:27.682
But why not change your complete being through self-realization.

00:35:28.402 --> 00:35:33.532
That is very important, to understand that
we are transformed,

00:35:33.651 --> 00:35:39.317
and we must have our own dignity of Sahaja Yoga -

00:35:39.706 --> 00:35:47.867
 the way we behave, the way we move about and work.

00:35:49.101 --> 00:35:56.489
My experience is that once they come to Sahaja Yoga, mostly,

00:35:56.514 --> 00:36:03.757
they become very, very beautiful people;

00:36:04.319 --> 00:36:13.567
and that gradually start growing like
flowers, fragrant with their compassion and love.

00:36:13.929 --> 00:36:20.371
But also there are people who do not understand how to grow.

00:36:20.889 --> 00:36:26.846
They have their own small circle into which they move,

00:36:27.096 --> 00:36:32.248
and they get just stagnated, they become dwarfed.

00:36:32.409 --> 00:36:37.411
And then such Sahaja Yogis have to leave Sahaja
Yoga.

00:36:37.871 --> 00:36:47.805
So it is the responsibility of all the Sahaja
Yogis to watch and see how far their mind is working.

00:36:48.661 --> 00:36:50.716
Where are they going?

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:52.795
What are they doing?

00:36:52.836 --> 00:37:02.038
How are they achieving their status as Sahaja Yogis?

00:37:03.232 --> 00:37:16.390
So these Lakshmi and, Lakshmis I would say,
and also the Lakshmipatis in Sahaja Yoga have

00:37:16.468 --> 00:37:22.275
to be very different than the other people
who have money.

00:37:24.589 --> 00:37:36.019
Mahalakshmi principle should give you a very sober,
 balanced, affectionate and loving temperament.

00:37:36.793 --> 00:37:42.015
If it doesn't give you, then you should know
there's something missing.

00:37:42.159 --> 00:37:48.770
After all, you have come to Sahaja Yoga
not for anything else but for your growth.

00:37:49.072 --> 00:37:59.698
And to keep that growth on, you have to acquire
a sense of understanding what should be your,

00:37:59.771 --> 00:38:10.076
your personality - relative to others, relative
to other people who are still seeking,

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:18.194
who are still blind, we have to achieve a global emancipation.

00:38:18.403 --> 00:38:23.569
I know that's my vision is, and the other day we were counting

00:38:23.617 --> 00:38:26.568
 how many projects have started.

00:38:26.593 --> 00:38:29.325
So, we had to stop at 35.

00:38:29.421 --> 00:38:38.416
Already 35 projects have started in India, also in other countries,

00:38:38.886 --> 00:38:46.305
and they are only for emancipating human beings.

00:38:47.791 --> 00:38:56.076
But firstly, as I told you, to do work in
Sahaja Yoga you have to be a detached person.

00:38:56.307 --> 00:39:03.575
That is the quality of a Mahalakshmi principle,
that such a person is detached.

00:39:04.427 --> 00:39:08.758
He is not attached to things which are worthless.

00:39:08.903 --> 00:39:14.432
But that doesn't mean that you take a sanyasa
and run away from the family,

00:39:14.457 --> 00:39:18.516
run away from your household, run away from ...

00:39:18.636 --> 00:39:22.119
 that's not detachment, that's running away.

00:39:22.411 --> 00:39:29.592
But detachment is that when you have everything,
still you are detached:

00:39:29.649 --> 00:39:38.446
 in the sense you do not feel concerned
 about your own gain out of this.

00:39:39.626 --> 00:39:48.721
Such things can happen, very easily, if you really introspect.

00:39:49.094 --> 00:39:54.089
And introspection is the best way of meditation.

00:39:54.332 --> 00:40:00.335
First introspect and then meditate, then you will grow.

00:40:00.371 --> 00:40:09.791
And the real joy of yourself, of your Spirit,
will really give you such enjoyment

00:40:09.896 --> 00:40:15.219
that you will not take to stupid, insignificant things.

00:40:15.244 --> 00:40:23.153
But you will become very significant people
in Sahaja Yoga who will do such wonderful work

00:40:23.315 --> 00:40:29.792
 that everybody will be amazed that an
ordinary human being,

00:40:29.817 --> 00:40:34.895
 how can he achieve such things, how can he work it out?

00:40:34.975 --> 00:40:41.064
As I've told you before, that after realization
you become extremely creative -

00:40:41.195 --> 00:40:47.025
 creative in everything, specially in giving realization
to others,

00:40:47.168 --> 00:40:55.248
and also creating creative in your life of art,

00:40:55.273 --> 00:41:01.412
 music, poetry, drama, writing - all kinds of things you do.

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:05.436
We have seen now so many cases who have never been

00:41:05.461 --> 00:41:12.847
 on the stage, even, have given very great, inspiring lectures.

00:41:12.999 --> 00:41:17.871
So the creativity comes like an inspiration for others.

00:41:17.992 --> 00:41:20.463
They see you and they feel inspired.

00:41:20.751 --> 00:41:25.042
You are not the one who goes into the shadow and sits back.

00:41:25.082 --> 00:41:27.184
But openly you come out.

00:41:27.209 --> 00:41:36.574
With no pride or no sort of aggression, but
complete humility;

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:40.844
 and you give such beautiful feelings to others,

00:41:40.869 --> 00:41:45.874
such understanding about yourself and about the other

00:41:45.899 --> 00:41:48.548
through yourcollective consciousness.

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:55.049
See about collective consciousness and other
things, so many people have talked.

00:41:55.074 --> 00:41:59.808
The other day you saw it, there were so many people like Jung

00:41:59.913 --> 00:42:08.522
and also there were other scientists and also other philosophers who
have talked about it.

00:42:08.547 --> 00:42:13.957
But you have got it, you have the experience
of collective consciousness.

00:42:14.095 --> 00:42:20.218
Despite that, if you are lagging behind

00:42:20.243 --> 00:42:24.994
in your progress of Sahaja Yoga, in Sahaja Yoga,
that means there is something wrong.

00:42:25.019 --> 00:42:28.962
Some sort of a load you are carrying on your head.

00:42:29.105 --> 00:42:34.296
But through our attachments, there could be loads on your head.

00:42:34.529 --> 00:42:40.785
In Sahaja Yoga you are involved with everything and you are detached.

00:42:40.972 --> 00:42:46.549
And such a miracle happens to you which
you know very well, I don't have to describe it.

00:42:46.989 --> 00:42:52.919
So a new personality with a Mahalakshmi principle comes in.

00:42:53.033 --> 00:42:58.148
Mahalakshmi principle is the one which takes you to your seeking

00:42:58.196 --> 00:43:01.836
and when you have found out the reality,  the truth,

00:43:02.157 --> 00:43:04.173
 then you progress.

00:43:04.198 --> 00:43:09.342
With Mahalakshmi principle only, you get your
realization.

00:43:09.367 --> 00:43:15.063
You know that very well, that through the
Mahalakshmi channel only you rise,

00:43:15.088 --> 00:43:17.750
and you get your realization.

00:43:17.893 --> 00:43:28.693
So to become a great Sahaja Yogi,
 you have to look after your Mahalakshmi principle.

00:43:28.718 --> 00:43:34.308
Now there are people I have seen who care for cheap popularity.

00:43:35.291 --> 00:43:39.297
I have known people who will do everything
for others,

00:43:39.322 --> 00:43:42.720
do this, do that, but only for popularity.

00:43:42.783 --> 00:43:50.662
There's no - essentially understood - they
have not essentially understood that

00:43:50.687 --> 00:43:54.680
 whatever you are doing, is it for cheap popularity?

00:43:55.155 --> 00:43:58.784
You don't have to fight an election in Sahaja Yoga,

00:43:58.882 --> 00:44:01.959
you don't have to cast your votes in an election.

00:44:01.984 --> 00:44:08.951
But what happens daily, the person who has
that dynamism of Sahaja Yoga

00:44:09.013 --> 00:44:12.341
 just comes up. Everybody knows.

00:44:12.513 --> 00:44:22.751
Not talking, not impressing, not showing off,
not going after cheap popularity,

00:44:22.776 --> 00:44:29.301
 but growing within - for that I cannot say what you have to do.

00:44:29.326 --> 00:44:32.493
How does a tree grow? By itself.

00:44:32.592 --> 00:44:36.305
You are living examples of Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:36.481 --> 00:44:39.591
So how will you grow by yourself?

00:44:39.775 --> 00:44:46.238
By yourself you'll grow - is a promise that
is given to you by the Divine.

00:44:46.349 --> 00:44:53.697
But allow it to grow, through introspection and meditation,

00:44:54.080 --> 00:45:00.141
 and what we call complete dedication and devotion.

00:45:00.207 --> 00:45:08.600
The other day I told you about the word shraddha
- it's not just praying, it's not just having faith,

00:45:08.731 --> 00:45:14.568
but shraddha is that you have it in your heart -

00:45:14.664 --> 00:45:22.118
the enjoyment of achievement through your devotion and dedication,

00:45:22.215 --> 00:45:25.344
 that should be called as shraddha.

00:45:25.413 --> 00:45:28.858
With that thing only it will work out.

00:45:29.017 --> 00:45:34.035
But you have to have faith in yourself and
faith in Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:34.167 --> 00:45:39.303
You know you have got it, those people were
talking about it, but you have got it -

00:45:39.308 --> 00:45:41.819
 you know what is collective consciousness.

00:45:41.902 --> 00:45:44.758
You know that you are in the collective consciousness.

00:45:44.842 --> 00:45:48.981
But how far you have grown into it is to be seen.

00:45:49.006 --> 00:45:50.567
It's very important.

00:45:50.591 --> 00:45:57.344
For that, I need not in this short time describe
to you all the qualities of the Lakshmi but

00:45:57.368 --> 00:46:07.155
try to understand that a person who has Lakshmi
principle has to have all these special qualities

00:46:07.179 --> 00:46:11.721
otherwise he is not the worshiper of Lakshmi.

00:46:12.649 --> 00:46:18.121
And that's how I would today bless you all with the proper wisdom

00:46:18.146 --> 00:46:21.980
and the proper understanding of the Lakshmi principle

00:46:22.047 --> 00:46:25.771
 through the lights which are enlightened within your heart.

00:46:25.795 --> 00:46:27.375
May God Bless You.

00:46:35.666 --> 00:46:38.687
May God Bless You.
