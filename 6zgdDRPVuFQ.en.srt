1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:16,630
Today we have gathered here to worship Shri 
Krishna’s incarnation.

2
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:26,650
As you know that Shri Krishna is the incarnation 
of Narayana, of Shri Vishnu.

3
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:36,620
So in every incarnation they carry all their 
qualities, all their powers and all their

4
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,280
nature with them.

5
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:55,680
So when He incarnated He had all the qualities 
of Narayana and then that of Rama, but every

6
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:09,200
incarnation tries to rectify whatever in their 
previous life has been misunderstood and have

7
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,539
been carried to the extremes.

8
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:32,719
That’s why they have to come back again 
and again.

9
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:45,630
So as Shri Vishnu, when He thought of taking 
His incarnation, because He is the one who

10
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,590
is the preserver.

11
00:01:47,590 --> 00:02:03,859
He’s the preserver of this creation and 
also the preserver of dharma.

12
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:14,410
So when He took His incarnation He had to 
see that people keep to their dharma.

13
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:24,910
By keeping the dharma all right only, you 
could get your realization.

14
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:33,849
So the job was quite difficult one, I should 
say, to keep people in the central path of

15
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:37,989
Mahalakshmi.

16
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:52,890
So by first incarnation, you can say that, 
He tried to create a benevolent king, as Shri

17
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:53,890
Rama.

18
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,060
Socrates has described a benevolent king.

19
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:05,890
But as a result of that, people started thinking 
if they have become queen and king, born in

20
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:16,079
the family of royalty, then they are gods.

21
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:22,780
Shri Rama was the Purushottama – means He 
was the best among all the human beings.

22
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:31,269
That means He incarnated as a human being, 
total human being, showing all the qualities

23
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:33,400
of human beings.

24
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:46,329
Like He was, He married the Lakshmi principle 
that was Sita, and then also He lived a normal

25
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:47,329
married life.

26
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:57,900
When He gave Her up He lived like an ascetic 
to show how a man should lead his life in

27
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,110
a proper dharma as a married man.

28
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:11,529
And even when the wife has gone away, how 
He was leading a life of complete chastity.

29
00:04:11,529 --> 00:04:16,530
And He never had another marriage, though 
many people said that “You should have another

30
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,130
marriage.”

31
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:31,840
So the system that was the best, to have a 
monogamy, He followed it.

32
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:39,790
By His life, He showed how a husband should 
be with his wife.

33
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:44,530
But then later on He had another role as the 
king.

34
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:52,870
When He became the king then He found out 
that people were criticizing Him because He

35
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:57,520
brought Sita back from Ravana.

36
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:04,580
So Shri Rama decided to send Her away from 
Him.

37
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:13,270
How many people in this world, who are in 
power, would be that sensible about that power

38
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:21,250
that they have, that they have to behave in 
a manner that they should be ideals, for all

39
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,780
other people who are working under them, for 
the administration, for looking after the

40
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,560
country?

41
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:40,520
But Sitaji also, because She was also Mahalakshmi, 
She understood everything, the whole play,

42
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:49,479
and She went away and then Shri Rama also 
taught how to rule the people.

43
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:53,729
So they say the most ideal kingdom was Ramaraj.

44
00:05:53,729 --> 00:06:04,379
When Rama ruled this world there was peace, 
no competitions, everyone was joyous and happy

45
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:17,449
because He was the one who was emitting fair 
play and dharma, joy, bliss and peace.

46
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:24,990
So there was no need to have any struggle, 
no competition, no fighting, nothing.

47
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:34,259
So this Benevolent King came as a incarnation 
to show us how a king should be, and He lead

48
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:43,360
a life of a serious type, very dedicated and 
serious type of life, how a benevolent king

49
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,080
should be.

50
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:55,050
As a result of His incarnation – always 
people take to something, something which

51
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,290
is not normal.

52
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:07,690
So because He lived as an ascetic people started 
following asceticism.

53
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:14,740
“We’ll not marry, we’ll not have our 
wives, we’ll live like Rama,” all these

54
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,379
things they started, so asceticism grew up.

55
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:25,210
Before that, before Shri Rama all the saints 
used to marry, they used to have wives they

56
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,440
used to have children, they lived a very normal 
life.

57
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:34,169
Only they were saints because they were very 
highly evolved people and they lived in ashrams

58
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:44,310
doing the work of realization and also other 
corrections in human beings.

59
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:55,300
Now when Shri Rama came, people thought that 
“He was Shri Rama, so let us be like Him.

60
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,810
Because He lived like an ascetic let us also 
live like an ascetic.”

61
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:10,180
So this foolish idea of asceticism crawled 
in and then people became very austere type,

62
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,849
very austere.

63
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:19,800
Nobody would laugh, nobody would smile, everything 
was very serious, absolutely, and everything

64
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,610
was done in a very dry manner.

65
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:32,380
So many seekers did not marry but apart from 
seekers many seers and saints also did not

66
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:39,010
marry and because they had no balance, because 
marriage gives you a balance, they became

67
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:46,650
very dry people, very hot tempered people, 
and we have some examples of some rishis who

68
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:55,750
are known for their hot temper and their ascetic 
qualities by which they could destroy anyone,

69
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:01,580
make them into ashes – in Sanskrit it’s 
called as Bhasma Karoti.

70
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:13,030
So these qualities developed, that is the 
time Shri Krishna came back, from Shri Rama’s

71
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:16,720
incarnation He came back as Shri Krishna.

72
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:29,020
Sri Krishna’s incarnation came to show that 
this whole Creation is fun, is Leela.

73
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:32,760
That’s why He’s Leeladhar, He’s called 
as Leeladhara.

74
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:44,351
He was the one who showed that everything 
is fun, there’s nothing to be serious, nothing

75
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:49,340
to be dry, nothing to be ascetic but the whole 
life is a fun.

76
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:57,010
He gave this idea because people had become 
so austere.

77
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:05,470
And then also a kind of a funny Brahminism 
started, like they would not eat, they created

78
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:09,100
a caste system which started developing.

79
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:15,880
The caste was determined by birth, which was 
wrong, and they could not eat food.

80
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:22,890
Then the Brahminism started growing up, quite 
strong, and these Brahmins started dominating

81
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,410
others.

82
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:43,780
So Shri Krishna came and He came as a son 
of a milkman (gwale ki ladke).

83
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:53,950
But they were rich milkmen, very rich milkmen.

84
00:10:53,950 --> 00:11:03,800
Now that is the time, you see, the whole play 
was brought forth, and the play was quite

85
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:17,790
cruel I should say, because one horrible devil, 
rakshasa, somehow or other used a lady who

86
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:34,690
was mother of Kamsa, and she is the mother 
also of, you can say grandmother of Shri Krishna.

87
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:42,080
So she had a son who was also a rakshasa, 
so it’s all a play of the same.

88
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:51,630
So He had an uncle who was a devil, who was 
a rakshasa and He was supposed to kill this

89
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:57,170
uncle – see the play, this is a drama all, 
just see the drama as it worked out.

90
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:05,080
He was supposed to kill this uncle who was 
very powerful and who was a devil.

91
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:20,680
So in His childhood He used to play, He used 
to play with milkmaids and with other ladies.

92
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,340
He was very young, He was about five years 
of age.

93
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:32,670
And He did all kinds of pranks and He did 
all kinds of leelas, like He killed one snake,

94
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:38,170
very big snake – a cobra – very well known 
cobra.

95
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:47,880
And also He killed many rakshasas and rakshasinis 
with His power – in a play.

96
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:53,140
Just in a play, He used to do it, and you 
must have read the stories about Him – how

97
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:59,890
He showed that there is no need to have a 
big army of people as Shri Rama had – He

98
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:07,910
didn’t use any monkeys or anyone, though 
Hanumana was always, was sitting on His chariot.

99
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:12,460
But He never used all these outside powers.

100
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:22,250
Only whatever He had the weapons that He used, 
to show that there is no need to use any army

101
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:29,750
or other people to kill a rakshasa.

102
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,040
And all was in a very playful manner.

103
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:44,370
At the time of Shri Rama He was not supposed 
to know that He was an incarnation but it

104
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:53,500
was reflected to Him by various methods that 
He was an incarnation and still He would not

105
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,740
accept it because He was not supposed to know.

106
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:01,880
It’s something like Mahamaya.

107
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:12,930
But say all the cameras are now giving you 
all the evidence of the real Mahamaya, what

108
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,930
She is like.

109
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:23,040
But one may try to show that you don’t remember, 
you don’t have, you have no memory of it.

110
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:29,760
Because if you remember it then your action 
would not be human, they would become divine

111
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:36,250
actions, and that may be not all right for 
human beings because they won’t be able

112
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:42,990
to stand, or they’ll be frightened, they’ll 
be such an awe.

113
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:50,380
So Shri Krishna normally behaved like a very 
ordinary person.

114
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:57,310
Like in His childhood, He was very fond of 
butter.

115
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,950
And as you know butter is very good for the 
throat.

116
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:05,500
For Vishuddhi I’ve told you many-a-times 
that on your tea you put some butter and take

117
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:10,320
it so that your throat which is dried out 
will feel better.

118
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:19,760
So He was very fond of butter and He would 
go and make His friends help Him, and made

119
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:26,560
a pyramid out of them, would climb up and 
break the butter container and would eat all

120
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,530
that butter like a little baby.

121
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:32,330
So one day His mother said, “All right, 
why did you eat butter?”

122
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,690
He said, “I never ate.”

123
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,950
She said, “Then what is this on your mouth?”

124
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:39,440
He said, “This is, all these boys have put 
it on my mouth.”

125
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,550
You see, to Him, even telling such little, 
little lies also was a fun, with the mother

126
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,550
to that extent.

127
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,100
Like “don’t tell lies!

128
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,140
You must not!”

129
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,720
No, there was no fun in this kind of thing.

130
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,790
So He told her a lie.

131
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,820
“See now, these people have put it on my 
mouth.

132
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:02,690
They have eaten all the butter and now I am 
the one you are catching!” you see.

133
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,030
So she said, “Really?

134
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,370
Open your mouth!”

135
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:14,120
So He opened His mouth and there She saw all 
this [universe] (Mother points to the solar

136
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,680
system which is part of the puja decoration 
backdrop) in the mouth.

137
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,880
The whole universe moving in the Vishuddhi, 
the complete Vishuddhi chakra she saw, and

138
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,270
she just bowed to Him.

139
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:29,830
Then He says, “Why are you bowing to Me?” 
as if nothing has happened.

140
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:43,220
So, you see, all His pranks and all His childish, 
sweet lies, were just to create a feeling

141
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:52,630
of understanding, and it’s regarded as something 
very sweet, according to the Indians, or we

142
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:57,770
can say according to the eastern ideas, that 
children are naughty like that with the mother.

143
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:03,980
They all enjoy the naughtiness of the children, 
little naughtiness here, naughtiness there.

144
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:16,360
And the strictness of children to a great 
extent, also is there because, I think, people

145
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,421
are not attached to their children.

146
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:19,019
They don’t love their children.

147
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:24,790
They love their carpets, love everything else 
because they can sell it, but they can’t

148
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,250
sell their children.

149
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,679
And that kills the joy.

150
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:39,669
So the children and the parents are separated 
by materialistic ideas that this material

151
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:43,529
is more important than their own children.

152
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:48,340
So in His childhood He has shown lots of pranks 
and lot of things, and the way He used to

153
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,980
steal also.

154
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,220
Now stealing is supposed to be bad.

155
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:57,019
Some, belongs to somebody else, if you steal, 
is bad.

156
00:17:57,019 --> 00:18:01,080
But He was stealing only the butter of His 
mother that He had made them.

157
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,950
And He used to steal the butter of all the 
ladies who used to take down to Mathura, where

158
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:14,500
Kamsa was ruling, and this butter was eaten 
by all the rakshasas there and they were becoming

159
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,240
very powerful.

160
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,370
So He thought best thing is to go and eat 
all the butter so that these ladies won’t

161
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,639
be able to go and sell it.

162
00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:31,899
Also if you see it significantly is this that 
we starve our children, we starve our families,

163
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:32,899
just to have some money.

164
00:18:32,899 --> 00:18:39,970
Money orientation is there, that you can go 
and sell your butter to somebody.

165
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:45,600
With this idea – everything to be sold out, 
we have to sell out this, we have to sell

166
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,090
out that.

167
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:50,889
Nothing is going to be kept with ourselves.

168
00:18:50,889 --> 00:18:58,980
So the children are the only permanent liabilities, 
so the children are treated as if they are

169
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:04,090
just burdens while all other things are good 
because you can sell it.

170
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:10,080
So the whole value system, if it runs down 
to money, then children have no place in the

171
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,710
family.

172
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:22,789
According to Sahaja Yoga, children are more 
important than all the wealth of the world

173
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:25,519
and they are to be looked after that way.

174
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:30,730
Of course they should be told what is dignity 
is, how to behave themselves.

175
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:35,769
But their little, little pranks are to be 
understood and enjoyed because only as children

176
00:19:35,769 --> 00:19:41,450
they can do pranks, not as grown ups, so they 
should have that much freedom to play pranks

177
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:45,029
and to play some tricks on you.

178
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:51,710
Otherwise, they’ll become very serious people 
and might become ascetic.

179
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:58,279
Those parents who are very strict, their children 
are never normal; they either are extremely

180
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:08,100
perverse, rebellious or they are quiet down 
and they cannot face life.

181
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:16,470
So both are of the same style because one 
cannot face life another cannot be faced by

182
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,470
life.

183
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,470
It’s like this.

184
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,470
Nobody can face such people.

185
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,610
So you have to treat you children with great 
love and understanding but they should know

186
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:27,549
if they misbehave then this love will be finished.

187
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:29,340
So children only care for love.

188
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,549
They don’t know money.

189
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:31,760
They don’t know anything.

190
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:37,499
So the love that is you establish in your 
child becomes very precious thing.

191
00:20:37,499 --> 00:20:45,380
So the system of Sahaja Yoga is based on divine 
love and it can only work when people are

192
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,380
loving.

193
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:51,779
If they love money, if they love power, if 
they love their reputation, they love this,

194
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:58,519
love that, and not their own children or their 
families then they are absolutely losing a

195
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:05,299
very big part of the society and God knows 
what’s going to happen to these children

196
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:07,659
if you do not have love for your children.

197
00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:12,379
In Shri Krishna’s life, you can see various 
things He has shown.

198
00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:22,559
In His, you can say in His epic or in His 
biography if you see, you will find how many

199
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:27,419
facets of life He has handled with such beauty.

200
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:36,190
Then in His childhood, then He goes and kills 
the devil of Kamsa.

201
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:40,330
That too, how beautifully He does it.

202
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,509
How He kills the people who are surrounding 
Him.

203
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:53,120
How He knows their secrets, how they can be 
killed, it shows complete brilliance and very

204
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,600
beautiful organizing the whole thing.

205
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:07,720
Now imagine one Krishna fought, one Krishna 
fought the whole army of that Kamsa, how He

206
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,899
must have done it, because after all He’s 
Viraat.

207
00:22:11,899 --> 00:22:19,750
And the, all the powers that are of this all-pervading 
Power are in His hands.

208
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,309
He can do whatever He likes.

209
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:24,740
He can play around as He likes.

210
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:33,990
He can finish off anybody He wants, and it 
is so easy for Him to manage all these things

211
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,270
simultaneously.

212
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:39,140
Then came His life when He became the king.

213
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:48,169
When He became the king He wanted, I should 
say in a way that, He wanted to establish

214
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:53,879
people in dharma and He needed the help of 
the five elements.

215
00:22:53,879 --> 00:23:00,910
So He made them into five ladies whom He married; 
so He has five wives but they are five elements,

216
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:03,279
part and parcel of His being.

217
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:11,470
But He was Yogeshwara, absolutely detached 
in His yoga, but He had, for practical purposes

218
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,570
we can say, five wives.

219
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:18,899
And they were sixteen thousand women who became 
His wives.

220
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:24,090
These sixteen thousand women are nothing but 
His sixteen thousand powers because you know

221
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:34,390
His chakras they have got sixteen petals and 
these sixteen petals multiplied by the Virata’s

222
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:40,379
one thousand petals each – so it comes to 
sixteen thousand powers.

223
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:47,320
So these sixteen thousand powers were incarnated 
as women, were taken away by some horrible

224
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:52,619
king and He went there, fought that king and 
brought these ladies.

225
00:23:52,619 --> 00:24:00,870
Now, even now it is so that even an old man, 
has a young lady with Him, people will never

226
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:01,960
think that there is good relationship.

227
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,179
They’ll always think there must be something 
wrong.

228
00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:09,940
So He had to marry them, because He had to 
keep these ladies, so He married them.

229
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:14,799
But mother’s position is different because 
mother can have thousand children.

230
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:20,970
But poor man, even if he has one woman around 
him, everybody will say he’s a bad person.

231
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:26,700
So He had to marry all of them, so-called 
marriage, and these sixteen thousand powers

232
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:34,679
stayed with Him by which He established our 
Vishuddhi Chakra.

233
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:40,320
Now when we have our Vishuddhi problems we 
have to know what are the deities on both

234
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,940
the sides and what were their qualities which 
are lacking in us – that’s why we are

235
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,940
suffering.

236
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:55,419
Let’s see the right side Vishuddhi when 
we catch.

237
00:24:55,419 --> 00:25:05,259
Shri Krishna’s essence is sweetness – madhuriya, 
madhuriya.

238
00:25:05,259 --> 00:25:06,529
And His power was Radha.

239
00:25:06,529 --> 00:25:11,389
“Ra” is energy “dha,” means the one 
who has sustained the energy.

240
00:25:11,389 --> 00:25:14,450
And Her power was, She was called as Ahlada.

241
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:17,929
“Ahlada” means joy giving qualities She 
had.

242
00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:26,690
So Shri Krishna’s qualities were that He 
was Yogeshwara, so He was the witness and

243
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:27,789
sweetness.

244
00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:39,710
Now a person who shouts and screams and talks 
loudly and loses his temper in a very loud

245
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:48,830
voice, or who speaks very loudly all the time, 
they all suffer from the right Vishuddhi..

246
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:54,799
So one should understand that even when you 
have to scold somebody, you have to just say,

247
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:55,799
“What are you doing?

248
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:56,799
Why are you doing like this?”

249
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:01,350
Otherwise “I give you, oh do like this?”

250
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,350
Finished!

251
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,730
Right Vishuddhi over.

252
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,519
It’s finished now.

253
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:11,100
So for the right Vishuddhi we use the mantra 
of Vitthala and Rukmini, these two persons.

254
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:16,820
You see it is very significant that also, 
because they say that there was a pundalikaksh,

255
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:21,100
one boy who was serving his parents.

256
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:29,970
And his parents were sleeping, he was pressing 
their feet when Vitthala and His power Rukmini,

257
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,360
they appeared in the door.

258
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,059
But he said, “Now keep quiet.

259
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:38,590
My parents are sleeping so you stay there!”

260
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:44,789
So he had one brick near him which he threw 
and asked them, “You stay on that.”

261
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:50,539
So They kept quiet, They kept quiet because 
they are sleeping.

262
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:52,960
Now this is the thing is.

263
00:26:52,960 --> 00:27:04,640
On the right side if you are talking loudly, 
if you talk too much, if you intimidate people

264
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,799
with your talking then you catch on right 
Vishuddhi.

265
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:16,369
So for that best is to take some rest and 
give some rest to your right Vishuddhi by

266
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:18,649
stopping your talk.

267
00:27:18,649 --> 00:27:21,539
Go into mauna they say, just don’t talk.

268
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:26,389
For some time if you don’t talk you will 
see that your Vishuddhi will be improved,

269
00:27:26,389 --> 00:27:28,820
your problems will be improved.

270
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:35,129
So as it happens, the right side, what happens 
is that the heat starts coming from the stomach.

271
00:27:35,129 --> 00:27:37,879
It’s all in one play.

272
00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:44,690
From the, we can say, not from the stomach 
but actually from the liver, the heat starts

273
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:45,690
rising.

274
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:51,659
It first goes into right heart, as a result 
you might become a very hot-tempered husband

275
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:53,299
or a father or something.

276
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:56,360
You might get asthma, anything, with that 
right heart.

277
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,429
Then it passes on to your right Vishuddhi.

278
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:05,149
When it goes to your right Vishuddhi then 
you become a very irritable, hot-tempered

279
00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:06,149
person.

280
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:08,249
All the time you shout at someone.

281
00:28:08,249 --> 00:28:09,610
Nobody can talk to you.

282
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:12,590
If somebody has to talk to you, he has to 
use a barge pole in between.

283
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,700
God knows what time he’ll shout at you.

284
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:20,539
Or maybe, I’ve seen many women lose their 
hearing or men lose their hearing when there

285
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:22,879
is somebody who is shouting at them.

286
00:28:22,879 --> 00:28:29,350
So shouting is a very bad thing for others 
and also for yourself because, of course,

287
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:34,780
your Vishuddhi goes out, after some time you 
voice goes out, after some time you cannot

288
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:39,029
talk, and sometimes they have to just keep 
quiet.

289
00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:47,499
But for others it’s even worse because if 
you use your anger in that manner then that

290
00:28:47,499 --> 00:28:53,259
person might be just frightened of you, might 
develop inferiority complex, might become

291
00:28:53,259 --> 00:28:59,460
a left sided person, might catch some bhoots 
or God knows what can happen to a person who

292
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,279
has somebody all the time shouting at him.

293
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,190
But the worst physical thing could be that 
he could become deaf.

294
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:16,200
So from Shri Krishna’s life one has to learn 
that how He would just play His flute and

295
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:27,759
the whole atmosphere used to become absolutely 
quiet, without any ripple of any trouble,

296
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:35,919
any idea of disturbance, just peaceful.

297
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,419
But in modern times the other way round.

298
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:43,730
They have the music where the right Vishuddhi 
is about to break or burst.

299
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:46,769
I don’t know what sort of a music it is.

300
00:29:46,769 --> 00:29:54,580
When they listen to this music, you see, then 
it excites, then it excites you.

301
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,230
It doesn’t make you peaceful.

302
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:00,789
It excites you, excites you more and more.

303
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:09,379
But, as Shri Krishna becomes Virata, your 
limbic area also gets numbed with it.

304
00:30:09,379 --> 00:30:16,370
And when this shouting music is too much then 
they have to use loud speakers and shout much

305
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,370
more.

306
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:22,509
Then they have to put something near the ear 
to hear something otherwise they have no excitement.

307
00:30:22,509 --> 00:30:31,710
All the exciting, we can say all the exciting 
cells become numbed.

308
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:40,200
And you have to really go in for tremendous 
effort to create that excitement in those

309
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,320
numbed cells.

310
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:47,929
So it’s very dangerous throughout, if you 
see that it starts from the liver, goes to

311
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:53,929
the right heart, then to Vishuddhi and then 
in the brain.

312
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:59,309
So then you take to drugs because your brain 
is numbed out.

313
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:05,200
So you take to drugs and when you take to 
drugs then you feel that you are all right.

314
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,049
Then again you feel that this drug is not 
sufficient then you take stronger drugs.

315
00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:11,330
Then you take more drugs.

316
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,220
It goes on one after another.

317
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:18,019
Ultimately, it reaches a stage when you are 
nowhere.

318
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:25,320
So it is all self-destructive.

319
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:42,830
(Shri Mataji coughs) I am also using My right 
Vishuddhi too much.

320
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:55,340
For right Visuddhi you have to learn to have 
mauna, means silence.

321
00:31:55,340 --> 00:32:00,450
Those who think, who are very dominating, 
who are talking in a very dominating manner,

322
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:07,700
whose right Vishuddhi is catching, should 
become silent and should, at least for some

323
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,669
time, should not talk at all.

324
00:32:10,669 --> 00:32:17,149
Maybe you might fix one day, say you can do 
it on a … say “I’ll not talk on Monday.”

325
00:32:17,149 --> 00:32:22,080
But supposing Monday you have to work, so 
you should say “I’ll not talk on Sunday.”

326
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,132
But human beings are such that if they decide 
that they will not talk on Sunday, then Sunday

327
00:32:26,132 --> 00:32:35,200
they will talk the most!

328
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:41,120
And this shouting and then intimidating people 
– you have no right.

329
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,919
You have no business to shout at anyone whatsoever.

330
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,059
What is the need to shout?

331
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:52,169
After all, you are a human being, another 
one is a human being.

332
00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:58,139
God has not given anybody whether it is a 
husband, wife, children or anyone.

333
00:32:58,139 --> 00:33:03,330
But I find even these days children shout, 
the mother shouts, the father shouts.

334
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:08,340
If you go in the house, you feel like running 
back because you’ll find, hear, nothing

335
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,559
but shouts.

336
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:17,739
So this kind of a family system will rock, 
completely finish that family and there will

337
00:33:17,739 --> 00:33:24,909
be no beautiful relationship between each 
other and between the other people.

338
00:33:24,909 --> 00:33:30,049
Sometimes who can say, the whole country is 
having nothing but shouting at one and shouting

339
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,049
at another.

340
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:33,830
All over you go you find nothing but shouting.

341
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:39,590
Even if you take your car little bit this 
side there will be a shouting, I mean.

342
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:44,519
For the slightest excuse, they start shouting 
and spoiling their right Vishuddhi.

343
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:50,539
Now, for politicians, they think it’s the 
best way to shout because they can really

344
00:33:50,539 --> 00:33:53,960
impress people by their shouts you see.

345
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,700
So they shout a lot, tell people this that.

346
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:01,470
When they speak, you should hear there’s 
no sweetness in their tongue, nothing of the

347
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,470
kind.

348
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:05,429
But they shout and by shouting a person gets 
frightened.

349
00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:06,679
“All right, you want the vote?

350
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:08,190
We’ll give you but don’t shout.”

351
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:14,060
That’s how many people get elected and become 
big and think that they are very successful

352
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,520
because they have been shouting (laughter).

353
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:22,130
Then they have training for shouting and they 
go in for higher and higher education in shouting,

354
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:29,190
how to shout, how to intimidate people by 
the loud voices.

355
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:33,890
For Sahaja Yogis it doesn’t behove.

356
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:40,429
Sahaja Yogi has to be a very sweet person 
to talk, extremely sweet.

357
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:51,850
Now when you are thinking of, say, Shri Rama 
as a person who was a king, and then you have

358
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:55,620
got Shri Krishna who was a diplomat.

359
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:59,280
So what is the divine diplomacy?

360
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,160
You don’t have to shout, but you change 
the subject.

361
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:14,200
If you want to bring somebody to a, some, 
conclusion – then best thing is first you

362
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:20,490
change the subject and gradually, if you are 
clever enough, then you go on changing, changing

363
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:24,970
and you bring it back to the right thing.

364
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:27,810
That’s the clever thing to do.

365
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:32,600
Otherwise, just by shouting if somebody may 
say, “Yes, all right, I’ll do it,” by

366
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,850
the time you are gone they’ll say, “Yah, 
I’ll do it.”

367
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:39,300
That means something else.

368
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:45,340
So you see, he might say, “yes” and “yah” 
anytime.

369
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:51,450
So to have a complete rapport with another 
person is to play with that person.

370
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:54,310
That’s what I did also in Russia.

371
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:58,430
I went round and round and round and round 
and brought him to the point that we have

372
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:02,240
to be very independent thing, and I managed 
it.

373
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,830
That is Shri Krishna’s style.

374
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,670
You see, because to face it.

375
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:12,410
Supposing somebody says, “Oh this is my 
idea; I’ve decided to do this and that and

376
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:17,690
everything,” then you should say slowly, 
“All right, now I would say what you are

377
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:19,900
saying is correct, absolutely correct.

378
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:25,070
I agree with you and what do you think about 
the other thing?”

379
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,350
something like that.

380
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:30,420
And then you should say, “Now, I can suggest.

381
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:35,940
But I would like to suggest,” like this, 
“if you can agree to it.”

382
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:41,300
You see, gradually if you go and talk like 
this things can work out and people can feel

383
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:50,910
really that you have taken time and you have 
spent that much time and have accepted their

384
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,710
proposal and things.

385
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,420
And they don’t feel bad.

386
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:06,050
So one has to know that what is the essence 
of all this diplomacy.

387
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:14,720
Can you tell me?

388
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:25,420
What is the essence of this diplomacy?

389
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:28,230
Is benevolence.

390
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:34,420
You have to achieve the benevolence of the 
whole humanity.

391
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,960
This is the essence of it.

392
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,220
If you are doing it, you are not doing for 
yourself, for your gain.

393
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:42,300
You are not doing for the gain of any particular 
person.

394
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:48,640
But you are doing it for the benevolence of 
the whole humanity.

395
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:53,310
So once, you know this is the essence, so 
what is the need to shout?

396
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:56,720
By shouting you are not going to achieve anything.

397
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,030
So to play around with it and bring it to 
that point which is benevolence.

398
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:08,180
Like Krishna was asked that “You said that 
you have to tell the truth and it has to be

399
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,390
also very pleasing.

400
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,000
Satyam vadet, priyam vadet.”

401
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,880
He said, “how can it be?

402
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,150
These two things cannot be.

403
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:22,260
Supposing you tell the truth people may not 
like it, may not please that person.

404
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,430
So He said, “No.

405
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:28,690
It should be ‘Satyam vadet, hitam vadet, 
priyam vadet.'”

406
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:37,410
That “Tell the truth, tell for the benevolence 
and tell the pleasing thing.”

407
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:42,540
Supposing you tell somebody the truth, he 
may not like that at that time.

408
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:45,500
Supposing you tell that person, “Now don’t 
go today by plane.”

409
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,480
He will not like it, “What do you mean?

410
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,710
I’m going to go.”

411
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,130
“No please don’t go.

412
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,349
I request you.”

413
00:38:52,349 --> 00:38:57,770
Then he finds out that day the plane went 
and had a crash.

414
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:01,710
So he thinks, “This was good because for 
my benevolence this has worked out.

415
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,960
So this is something so good.”

416
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,610
So immediately, he feels obliged to you and 
he feels that you have told him the truth

417
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:12,730
by which it was his benevolence and that’s 
why he’s pleased.

418
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:18,740
So in the long run if you talk something for 
the benevolence of a person, for the benevolence

419
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:26,800
of the spirit, then such a person immediately 
thinks that we have really done such a great

420
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:36,120
obligation on him, that you have saved him.

421
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:43,900
If even you have to tell some lies for the 
benevolence, it does not matter.

422
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:48,230
It will not have any effect because Shri Krishna, 
which is the deity, knows it.

423
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:53,410
For example, a man is coming to kill somebody 
and you know where that man is hiding.

424
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:56,000
He comes and asks you “Where is that man?”

425
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,230
Are you supposed to tell him the truth “All 
right, he’s there.

426
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,330
Go and kill him”?

427
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:02,330
No.

428
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:03,330
So what do you have to tell?

429
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:05,560
You have to tell him that “See.

430
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,700
I’m not going to tell you.

431
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,190
I don’t know.

432
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,190
Doesn’t matter.”

433
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:15,830
Because what he is asking is unauthorized 
is anadhikar.

434
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:20,420
He had no business, he has no authority to 
ask such a question.

435
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:24,930
And he had no authority to extract the answer 
from you.

436
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:28,380
Whether you give him the answer or not answer 
is your right.

437
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:34,020
If you understand that, it is not for the 
benevolence for the man who wants to kill,

438
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:39,890
because tomorrow he will be hanged, and not 
also for the benevolence of the person whom

439
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:41,760
he is seeking out.

440
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,720
So if you do like that then there is no problem.

441
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:52,720
You’ll find most of the people will just 
like you because they will know that you are

442
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,620
sincere, very honest, that you want to be 
benevolent.

443
00:40:55,620 --> 00:41:03,680
Now as you know I have told all of you everything, 
whatever I felt like about you, most of the

444
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:09,070
time I should say, not all of the time, but 
of course most of the time.

445
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:12,460
I have to also tell lies little bit.

446
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:18,630
But whatever I do you will find out is for 
your benevolence, is for your good.

447
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,330
I have to tell you.

448
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:22,550
I cannot run away from that.

449
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,670
I have to face it.

450
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:29,220
So you cannot run away from telling people 
what you think is right for them.

451
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:33,590
Specially those about whom you are in charge.

452
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:38,340
Like you have children, you’ve got a family, 
you’ve got other relations, of whom you

453
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:45,210
are in charge then best thing is that you 
have to tell them frankly what you think and

454
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,530
what is right.

455
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:48,580
It’s your duty.

456
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,190
Then people escape it also.

457
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:54,390
Many people who don’t want to face their 
children, I have seen, they’ll give them

458
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,980
toys, toys after toys.

459
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,761
They will not like to face their children, 
tell them, “No, I don’t like it.

460
00:41:58,761 --> 00:41:59,761
This is not good.

461
00:41:59,761 --> 00:42:02,480
I would like you to do like this and this.”

462
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:09,670
So discipline doesn’t mean, discipline doesn’t 
mean something very dominating of one person

463
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:15,740
or two persons, but discipline means that 
whatever we do has to be for the benevolence

464
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:20,160
of your spirit and the spirit of others.

465
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:28,040
That is what is the Sahaj discipline where 
you do everything for the benevolence of others

466
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:32,090
and for the benevolence of your own ascent.

467
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:37,970
Once you have established this idea of hita, 
of this benevolence, you have known the life

468
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:44,500
of Christ, life of Mohammed, life of all these 
great people.

469
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:49,740
Because what They have done is for the benevolence 
of the people.

470
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:54,840
So I would say now we have the left Vishuddhi 
and you know very well that left Vishuddhi

471
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:58,180
is the lightning, in the lightning.

472
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:00,420
Now what is lightning?

473
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:05,920
He just shouts and roars.

474
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:13,860
So a person who has got left Vishuddhi should 
actually become a person who can shout and

475
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:22,770
who can scream and who can, I should say, 
expose others as She did.

476
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:25,240
In the same way, you have to do it.

477
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:29,380
In that you should not be afraid, you should 
not worry, and you should not think “How

478
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:31,090
can I do it after all?”

479
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:38,670
But mostly the people who feel guilty is a 
type which has lost his confidence and the

480
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:44,490
ego has entered into the left side – it’s 
a very complicated situation.

481
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:48,790
So we have to be on the lookout that we are 
not guilty, it’s very important.

482
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:52,010
Guilty for this, guilty for that, it’s just 
a myth.

483
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:56,800
We want to escape reality that’s why we 
say we are guilty.

484
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,420
So you have to face, face it, your reality.

485
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:05,830
Try to find out what’s wrong with you and 
what’s wrong with another person and face

486
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:06,830
it.

487
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:13,980
That is much better than to just say, “Oh 
I feel very guilty,” and sitting down, because

488
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:26,370
Vishnumaya is nothing but like an electricity 
and electricity exposes people, she screams

489
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:33,430
at people, shouts at people, she roars at 
people.

490
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:37,360
So if you have a left Vishuddhi then you have 
to use these methods.

491
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:44,200
I would say a person who has an inferiority 
complex should go to the sea and address the

492
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:50,170
sea and tell, “I am the lord of the sea, 
I am this, I am that!” loudly.

493
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:55,020
Those people who cannot speak on the stage, 
cannot come on the stage, they should go – also

494
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,830
same way – when they try they’ll become 
great speakers.

495
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:04,370
It will be a very good idea for you to go 
and just to give a big lecture and with that

496
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:15,820
big lecture you can always show that you are 
not suffering from any inferiority complex

497
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:20,310
but you are expressing yourself in a clear-cut 
way.

498
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:29,340
So now you will see the power of Shri Krishna 
is of the throat, of the right side, where

499
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,380
what is the power He has got?

500
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:37,070
The power is that He is sweetness.

501
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:41,750
He has the power of the shouting – or you 
can say with which, the vocal chord as you

502
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:44,060
call it.

503
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:51,150
He is the power of the vocal chord but how 
does He use His power is for sweetness is

504
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:52,810
a contrast.

505
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:57,550
And the same thing happens with Vishnumaya 
too.

506
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:03,720
Now Vishnumaya is the potential power in the, 
say, in the clouds, is a potential one.

507
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:11,600
But what She does is to scream, shout and 
show Her existence, that She exists.

508
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:16,460
Now all these photographs that you get and 
all these miraculous photographs you have

509
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:20,090
been showing me are because of Vishnumaya.

510
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:23,480
She is the one, as electricity, She acts.

511
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:27,540
And She is the one who manages all these things 
very well.

512
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:34,850
So though She is the sister of Shri Krishna 
She is in a way very much subtler because

513
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:37,580
She helps you in such a subtle manner.

514
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:43,220
Now this mic [microphone] it has electricity 
in it – you’ll be surprised My vibrations

515
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:45,430
are passing through this.

516
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:52,600
It is bombarding this and from here, they 
are going anywhere you want them to go.

517
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:57,280
You can put a computer on the other side and 
you can computerize Me.

518
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:06,560
It is such a remarkable thing that the one 
which is supposed to shout, scream and roar

519
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:15,040
is the one which is on the left hand side 
so that it exists in the people in a potential

520
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,040
way.

521
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:26,901
In the people who are feeling guilty, who 
are suffering from inferiority complex, who

522
00:47:26,901 --> 00:47:30,340
are sly, who feel they are good for nothing.

523
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,050
She exists in them.

524
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:33,530
See the contrast again.

525
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:44,040
She exists in them that Her power, She exists 
in a person, or expresses in a person who

526
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:49,690
is not self confident.

527
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:55,000
And then She asserts Her power by which persons 
become self confident.

528
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:01,080
This is how Her working comes in and that 
is potentially within us also.

529
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:07,540
So when we talk of Vishnumaya we have to know 
that She is sitting down there.

530
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:13,670
Any moment we decide, we can become great 
speakers, we can expose people.

531
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:17,410
We’ll be like lightning, we can roar.

532
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:19,940
But normally we are not.

533
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:25,840
So it gives balance to both sides of people.

534
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:33,260
But in the center when you rise – the kundalini 
rises – most of the people have their Vishuddhi

535
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:36,070
caught up, most of the people.

536
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:40,500
So they have to either see that they are not 
guilty or they have to see that there is no

537
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:44,940
shouting – nothing – they are not aggressive 
in their shouts.

538
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:52,200
And, plus, they have to see that they are 
completely in balance with themselves.

539
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:58,550
So they are in the central path by which they 
become sweet, kind and nice.

540
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:01,830
Now there are many people who artificially 
become sweet.

541
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:02,970
Artificially.

542
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:08,720
They have to take out some money so they’ll 
be extremely sweet and nice.

543
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:15,720
Such people are really going to go to hell 
because they are using the power of Shri Krishna

544
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:20,560
in a very absurd manner and for that, they 
cannot be spared.

545
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:23,850
So those who are artificially sweet are good 
for nothing.

546
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:32,230
You have to be really sweet and kind if you 
think of Him as the One who is Narayana, who

547
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:44,850
is Shri Rama, who is Shri Krishna and who 
is the Lord of your Vishuddhi.

548
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:49,760
So we have to control, not to feel guilty 
again, because there might be some people

549
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,880
who might be feeling that “Mother is saying 
to me.”

550
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:57,220
I’m not saying to anyone as such, it’s 
a general talk.

551
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:02,020
So what I’m saying is that if you are a 
person who is a shouting type, please bring

552
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:09,020
it round and keep it in check and take rest, 
give rest to your throat.

553
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:13,950
Some people are very happy if they are told 
that “Today collector sahib is in rest.”

554
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:18,370
They said, “Permanently or for a short time?”

555
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:22,720
Because he’s the one, if he’s a shouting 
fellow, nobody wants to see him.

556
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:27,690
No one likes any person who shouts, no one 
likes.

557
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:30,330
Even the nearest and dearest don’t like 
it.

558
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:36,780
Of course they tolerate, is different, but 
they don’t like it they don’t want it.

559
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:42,510
So for us it is important to understand that 
our Vishuddhi is to be kept clear first of

560
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:50,070
all we must have a beautiful heart, a very 
clean heart, where there is a fragrance of

561
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:55,150
Shri Krishna’s melodious music.

562
00:50:55,150 --> 00:51:00,672
Unless and until we have a beautiful, sweet 
music in our heart we can never be, never

563
00:51:00,672 --> 00:51:03,090
be good Sahaj Yogis.

564
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:13,450
I hope today’s evening puja, though has 
been rather late, doesn’t matter, will help

565
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:17,940
you to think about it, improving your Vishuddhi, 
working it out.

566
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:26,260
And then to look at the Viraat and find out 
what’s wrong with you, get it corrected

567
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:37,270
– which can be done by anyone – and see 
that you just have a full idea about yourself,

568
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:38,270
about your Vishuddhi.

569
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:43,520
And that’s only possible, only again it’s 
a vicious circle, if you have a good Vishuddhi.

570
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:48,950
If you don’t have a good Vishuddhi you can 
never see yourself because at the Vishuddhi

571
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:52,260
point only, you become the witness.

572
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:55,400
You are just a witness when you are at a Vishuddhi 
point.

573
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:59,050
So you have to be at the Vishuddhi a witness.

574
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:05,720
If you have achieved the witness nature then 
you can see in your Vishuddhi what’s wrong

575
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:11,420
with you, what’s wrong with your problems, 
with your atmosphere, everything, and you

576
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:15,730
will end up here only thinking, “Oh, this 
is the one that is wrong.”

577
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:23,230
So today, when we are worshipping Shri Krishna, 
we should know that our Vishuddhis and our

578
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:31,910
brain, because ultimately He becomes the brain, 
Shri Krishna becomes the brain.

579
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:35,750
That’s what I told you that the fat of the 
stomach goes in the brain.

580
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:43,670
So Shri Narayana enters into the brain and 
becomes what we call as Viraat, Akhbar.

581
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:52,990
And when He becomes Akhbar, then He’s the 
brain in the big macrocosm.

582
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:55,490
He’s the brain.

583
00:52:55,490 --> 00:53:03,770
So people who worship Shri Krishna become 
brainy people without ego.

584
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:08,150
Their brain develops and they have no ego 
about it.

585
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:17,230
Egoless intelligence, which I call as the 
pure intelligence, starts manifesting.

586
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:31,850
May God bless you all.

587
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:47,960
After this puja now you know that I’m going 
to Finland and you should see My itinerary.

588
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,080
It’s terrible.

589
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:56,960
And from Finland to Moscow, Moscow to India, 
India to Japan, and Japan to Los Angeles and

590
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,550
Los Angeles to New Zealand, New Zealand to 
Australia.

591
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:03,380
So this will be like this everyday practically, 
I think.

592
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:09,230
But whatever it is I’m going now and now 
you have some time.

593
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:16,660
We have lot of time now in between till I 
come in October to trouble you again.

594
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:23,190
So in this time you all should decide what 
you are going to do, how are you going to

595
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:26,931
help Sahaja Yoga, how you are going to work 
it out.

596
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:34,060
This is very important because I don’t need 
any Sahaja Yog, you need it and all the rest

597
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:35,210
of the world needs it.

598
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:37,500
But despite that I’m working so hard.

599
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,360
So you have to think that “Mother is now 
gone out, doesn’t matter.

600
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:45,040
We are going to work it out and we are going 
to find out what we can do about it.”

601
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,630
So please work out something till I come back.

602
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:55,410
I’ll be back here again in October, then 
we’ll see what we can do and achieve further.

603
00:54:55,410 --> 00:55:01,540
But let’s see what you have achieved and 
bring them to some conclusions, bring them

604
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:02,980
to some fruits.

605
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:06,110
And that is what I’m expecting.

606
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:13,990
Now I have to thank all the people who have 
done so much for Sahaja Yoga already and all

607
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:19,380
the centers and all the countries where Sahaja 
Yoga started and is growing so much.

608
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:25,640
I don’t know if you know the names of all 
the leaders or not, but it is worth knowing

609
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:33,740
all the leaders of all the countries and paying 
your attention to them and praying that they

610
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:44,610
should be able to deliver blessings of Sahaja 
Yoga to everyone.

611
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:52,990
Also they should be able to have visions, 
to see what they can do and how they can combine

612
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:57,190
different countries and how they can work 
out through their own countries.

613
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:03,420
So this is what it is and I have to thank 
all the leaders of the world and all the people

614
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:12,010
wherever I have been so far, for the arrangements 
and everything they did.

615
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:15,640
They worked very hard and achieved such a 
lot of things.

616
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:21,060
And I have to thank also the Sahaja Yogis 
who are with them, who have helped so much.

617
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:25,240
Thank you very much, all of you.

618
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,880
All right.

619
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:35,830
In today’s puja we’ll have first a Shri 
Ganesha’s three mantras and then we’ll

620
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:41,151
have hundred and eight names of Shri Krishna 
– if they have.
