00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:16.560
You can't imagine how a Mother who has so many beautiful children

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.320
sees them in such joyous mood

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.880
with their families, their children, nicely settled down.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:35.520
It's very satisfying to see you all so much

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:43.320
in joy and complete oneness with the Divine.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.800
One has to realize only one thing:

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.320
that though you are many,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.080
still compared to the population of this world, we are very few

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.320
who really know the true knowledge, the real knowledge.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.400
You are the people who are knowledgeable, no doubt,

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:16.240
but also knowledge which is not being adorned with truth

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.840
or which is not the true knowledge has no meaning.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
All that vanishes into thin air because it is artificial.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.560
By your Kundalini awakening you all have achieved

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.480
that state where we can say you know.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.720
You know what is the real knowledge is,

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.000
but think of the people who do not know what knowledge is.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.640
We take, for example we say that

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.800
our knowledge is nothing but love,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.480
but one should understand the discrimination.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.320
The knowledge that is love within you

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.160
is just emitting out from your being.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.160
You don't have to assert, you don't have to think,

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.800
you don't have to read some sort of a poetry

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.360
or go into some romantic mood

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:26.240
just pure love which emits, and this is the knowledge also.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.920
How you have to relate it is this way:

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.520
the knowledge that you have about yourself is evident,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.880
is absolutely expressed on your fingertips,

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.480
and about others also.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.320
You know about others and about yourself.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:56.520
This is the greatest subtle knowledge you have.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.400
No one knows like that.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.480
Apart from you people, no one knows about themselves or about others.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.640
So this knowledge that has come to you,

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.080
which is extremely subtle,

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.240
extremely secretive, absolutely secret.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.000
If you know about somebody, you know.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.000
Others do not know that you know about them,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.400
and so this knowledge that you have got is nothing but love.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.160
It's very difficult to make knowledge and love put together,

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.720
because our idea of knowledge is very different,

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.240
what we read from the books.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.320
How can you love from the books?

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.080
What love means, our attachments

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.000
to us, in ignorance we get attached

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.520
to people, to children, to family, to things.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.560
By getting attachment it is proved that we do not have the knowledge.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.000
If you have the knowledge then all attachments

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.400
should just drop out and you should become a global personality,

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.200
a drop in the ocean.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.440
For example, we are attached to many things,

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.400
like we are attached to our family.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.480
Something happens in the family we get very disturbed,

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.880
we can't bear it.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.360
If anything happens to our children, we feel horrible,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.320
it's just the whole world is falling on you.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.400
Then from family you move on. You are attached to your friends,

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.880
to your neighbors; you are also attached to your country.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.920
Attachment to your country is also not knowledge.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.880
Once you are a realized soul,

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.720
you just start seeing your country clearly:

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:03.160
what wrong it has got, what ignorance it has got,

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.640
in what darkness it exists,

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.920
and in what way it is quarrelling, fighting for rights and things.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.640
But with the knowledge that you have within yourself,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.480
you see it so clearly what is the problem of your country

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:27.240
then you try to improve that through your love,

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.680
means the power of your knowledge is love.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.320
If you have all the knowledge within you,

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.800
and if you are just sitting at home and meditating, it has no meaning.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.000
What you have to go is to go about, tell people

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.240
you have to meet other people, your friends, your family

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.800
and other relations about your knowledge.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.680
If you cannot do that, then your knowledge is not with love.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.480
It's such a connection between the two.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.160
You feel like telling everybody that you've got your realization.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.320
You feel like telling everyone that you are a realized soul,

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.560
but in that you feel that you are expressing your ego.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.080
All right, by some other ways, some other methods,

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.040
you can express to them that you have the true knowledge.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.000
When you have the false knowledge you can get ego.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.920
You can think that "I know so much, I know about this,

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:37.840
I know the color of the carpets, all the shades, everything."

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.400
Any stupid thing if you know, you think that you are very great.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.400
That's the sign of stupidity in your head also,

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.920
that you think this is very great to know.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.000
Now we have discovered

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:57.440
that through all kinds of acquiring knowledge in the whole world,

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.800
what we have achieved? Nothing.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.800
There are wars going on.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.640
There's all kinds of destructions coming in.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.520
I saw on the television this George.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.800
It's a whirlwind which is going round and is killing so many people;

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.240
is destroying so many people without understanding what he is doing,

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.200
but he's there and he's acting very well.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.520
So is it that he doesn't understand,

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.440
or is it that he understands

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.960
and that he is doing something just to correct people?

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.640
This also we should have full idea.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.640
Like yesterday when I came here it was raining heavily,

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.320
and then I sat down and suddenly it stopped,

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.080
stopped till the whole program was over.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.720
Till I spoke it was not working,

00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.400
but suddenly when you started clapping, also it started clapping

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:08.640
that's what it was. So even the nature knows who you are,

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.320
but you must know the nature, this is the point.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:18.920
Nature will act according to what your level of spirituality is.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.440
Surprisingly I always felt

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.480
that there cannot be levels of spirituality.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.560
I felt that once you get realization you are there,

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.560
but later on discovered I was wrong; it is not so.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.600
Even after getting realization, I found

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:41.560
people had so many obstructions in rising.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.800
There were so many temptations which were keeping them down.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:53.480
So one had to work out on different chakras, different nadis,

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.480
somehow or other to make you perfect,

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.360
because the perfection within only will give you

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.400
the authority to use this knowledge.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.280
There are as I told you two ways of doing it.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.360
The other day I told you that you should not react.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.880
It's human nature to react.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.600
It's absolutely human,

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.560
but if you have to become superhuman, you should not react.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.400
By not reacting you will grow, definitely you'll grow,

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.400
but if you react then you cannot grow,

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:32.440
because you are working under the pressure of other thing

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.520
that is not yourself.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.360
Now supposing as I said I see these carpets,

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.640
I know the color and this and that,

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.080
and I react to it - finished.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.880
I will not have any sense of judgment if I react to it,

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.880
but if I don't react,

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.320
then I'll know whether these carpets have got vibrations or not.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.840
Are they emitting vibrations or not?

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.640
Now what are these vibrations? That is the love.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.640
So the communication is like this: if you have the light

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.000
you can see things.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.640
So when you see things the light is there,

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.480
and light gives you the perception,

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.240
gives you the vision to see things.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.400
In the same way when you are enlightened,

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.440
what happens that these vibrations start flowing,

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.000
just like the light,

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:29.320
and in that light you can see things which are good and which are bad.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:37.320
But sometimes you put the same parameters as human beings do.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:42.560
Like you go to some house, a very nice house, very good house.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.560
All these things make you very happy;

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.960
but actually, what about that house?

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:56.480
Is it having good vibrations or it's having bad vibrations?

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.720
Is it worth living there or not?

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.240
Like the other day they told Me they can

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.200
get a very nice place in Milan,

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.000
little beyond Milan, on rent, very cheap.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.640
I said, "Why is it so cheap?"

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.480
Immediately I felt the vibrations of the place.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.160
I said, "Did you go and see the vibrations of that place?"

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.320
They went and saw - this was all burning.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.640
Then they found out that there was a Scientology there for years together.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.240
I said, "That's not the place where you can live.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.040
You have to have a very pure place.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.280
Even hut of a poor man would be better

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.160
than this comfortable so-called place."

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.440
So one has to use the vibrations all the time

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.680
to understand everything that you are doing.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.200
In that also it can be misleading them.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.960
Some people feel vibrations

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.160
and they tell Me, "Mother, I felt the vibrations

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.960
and I felt I should marry this man."

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.800
I said, "You did fel the vibrations?"  "Yes"

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.640
"Yes I did, very much, and I must marry this man."

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.720
And when I see the man I see the bhoot in him.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:13.680
I said, "My God, what sort of vibrations this lady

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.000
has felt about him?"

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.520
So in your judgment what is there: there's no pure knowledge.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:24.080
So see how, how connected they are

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.080
vibrations which is love;

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:33.480
and also the other thing which you have to have is the knowledge,

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.240
the pure knowledge, the true knowledge.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:42.280
We can say that pure knowledge and true knowledge is like the energy

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.400
like electricity.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:51.880
And the way you feel it, the way you understand it,

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:56.400
it exists. That is love.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.480
People don't understand also what is the love is.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.400
They get mad after someone and say that,

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:08.400
"Mother, I say I think that I am in love with that person."

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.800
And after five days they'll come and say,

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.640
"Mother, no, I won't have anything to do with that person."

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:19.800
Why? Because you have not got the pure knowledge.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.280
You did not feel the pure knowledge

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.240
in that person through your vibrations.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.520
Now see how connected it is.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.360
Like we can say the sun and the sunlight,

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.920
what is the difference between the two?

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.640
Sun is there. When sun comes, there's sunlight.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.600
So what is the difference?

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:45.320
Or we can say the moon and the moonlight; what is the difference?

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.320
There is no difference in these two things

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.720
one is the moon and another is the light.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:59.720
So all these things are very, very confusing,

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.800
that we don't understand how confused we are about it,

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:09.920
and we don't understand how our vibrations can mislead us.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:15.320
Because vibrations are there, all right,

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.800
but sometimes even if they are missing,

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.720
just to justify yourself you will say,

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:27.640
"We have vibrations and we feel that it's very good, excellent,"

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:31.320
and later on you'll discover that it's not so.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.000
So even now when we are realized souls,

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:40.800
we should know what is encompassing us, which is around us;

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:46.160
what is that which makes us feel that

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.400
it's all right, it is good, we should have it.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:56.920
Once we start understanding that vibrations of pure knowledge

00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:00.080
are of a very different nature,

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.040
then you're not attached to that person,

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.320
you're not attached to that family,

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.560
you're not attached to that country - nothing.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:14.160
But what you feel is the pure vibrations coming to you.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.160
This is the point which is very confusing

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:21.520
when you say, "My vibrations are good. I like those vibrations"

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:27.320
and while you jump into the ocean of filth.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.400
Many people have asked Me, "Mother,

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.720
why is it sometimes we make mistakes?"

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:38.160
You do not make mistakes. It's your ignorance, which is darkness,

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:42.840
and that's why whenever you plunge into it you fall into trouble.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:51.320
So to understand that our knowledge has to be completely clear.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:55.840
Like in our house supposing we have a lamp that's dirty,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.080
you cannot get the light.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.880
In the same way if our heart is not clean

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:05.320
specially our heart, if it is not clean,

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:10.320
then we start doing things believing that it's right,

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:14.560
and by which we hurt yourself or others.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.640
It's a very, very common error in human nature

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:23.480
to identify wrong things as right

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:31.800
and just to make themselves look such a great, such a divine thing.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.880
As I told you now there are people who want to

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.400
say, divide the country;

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.480
simple reason they want to divide.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.120
Now they want to divide this thing

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.560
because they want to have importance.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.240
The few people who want their importance

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.480
will instigate others, tell them, "All right, we must have freedom.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:57.040
If we have freedom we'll have this country for ourselves

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.000
then we can develop ourselves."

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.920
Or a part of the country which is richer, which is better off,

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.560
they will think that "It's all right, we'll have

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.800
all the money to ourselves, we'll have everything to ourselves,"

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:13.880
so they divide. They can divide in the name of religion,

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.320
in the name of prosperity - whatever it is.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:22.840
But if you divide the country actually you are facing a big problem,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.240
because you have seen that wherever people divide they fall into

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:37.800
a kind of a dark, dark dungeon from where they cannot come out.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.920
It's just a few people

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:46.760
whose ego is that they want to have some land as their own,

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:51.520
but they die; not only die, some of them are murdered,

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.800
and like that idea

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:59.080
that idea that "We'll have this possession of the land" goes away.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:03.720
So in the same way we can see on smaller things also.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:07.160
In smaller things also we are very much identified,

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.080
that "If I have this thing then everything will be fine."

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:15.400
You cannot understand how people just jump at things and say,

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.000
"Oh Mother, this is ours,

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:25.000
this is ours, we must do this for ourselves," openly.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:28.440
They don't think it's wrong to say that

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.880
"This is my country; I must do for my country."

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:36.400
And another says that "This is my country; I must do for my country."

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.080
As long as there is this "my and I"

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.320
that means there is no knowledge.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.960
The knowledge as I told you, pure knowledge

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.840
is that which gives you a pure light.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.240
Pure light means pure vibrations.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.240
Now vibrations can be misleading as I told you,

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:58.600
or could be the quantity of vibrations can be less or more.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:03.160
But there's another way to see - is to see for yourself,

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.720
why do you want to do a particular thing?

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:12.400
Mental also you can use, parameter of mental understanding.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:17.000
"Why do I want to do it? What is the gain for all the people?"

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.320
If you start thinking from that angle

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.320
that "What is the gain for others, what will they gain by this,

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.720
why should I do it?" - you'll be amazed.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.640
You will get the real picture of what you are doing.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:34.360
So you must keep yourself all the time

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.040
in a state where you witness yourself.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:42.640
You see yourself, that "Why am I doing this? What is the purpose?"

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.320
Sometimes it could be some conditioning,

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:49.320
could be some sort of a psychological thing, could be anything.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:53.920
But if you start watching carefully "Why I'm doing it?"

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:58.040
you'd be amazed that your vibrations itself

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.000
will start telling you on your fingertips.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.720
But sometimes the vibrations are so superficially coming,

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:09.080
"Ah, I got the vibrations, I'm this, I'm that."

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.920
For this reason I am saying again and again,

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.520
though you are such a nice family of Mine

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.720
and we are all so much blessed

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:20.680
and we have so much of knowledge with us,

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.840
we should be very wise.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.240
If there is no wisdom, if there is no wisdom,

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:33.080
we can never understand what we are doing.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.320
Now to develop this wisdom, what have you to do?

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.920
See every time, if I say anything they'll come otherwise,

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:44.840
"Mother, how do we get wisdom? What is the way to get the wisdom?"

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.480
Wisdom you have already within you,

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:51.320
Shri Ganesha is already there, who gives you the wisdom.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.720
But you must take to Shri Ganesh.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.720
There I find people become so much addicted to Shri Ganesh

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:03.920
that they lose His identity completely,

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:11.000
they become very slavish about the whole thing

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.720
and they just believe that,

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:18.920
oh, they are very spiritual, they are very great.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:23.200
All these false ideas are no good.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:27.680
Does your Ganesha gives you wisdom?

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:33.880
Now you must count, how many wise things have you done so far?

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:38.640
Where did you take a very wise decision?

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.640
Have you been wise to do something,

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.240
or you have been just doing it because you are identified

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:51.000
with a particular type of life or particular type of answer?

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:56.560
So wisdom is a thing that gives you, first of all, complete peace.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:01.320
If your wisdom is developed then you become very peaceful.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.680
Because whatever people may say, whatever they may do,

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.480
whatever aggression they may do, whatever it is, you are peaceful.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:13.320
And you see the stupidity of the other person, of the other nations,

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.640
and you understand why they are doing it.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.640
This wisdom is such an important thing in human being,

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:25.480
because animals don't have so much wisdom as we have.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:29.600
Sometimes of course, sometimes we have even less than animals have.

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:33.720
But still, by experience, you see,

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:37.240
we have to learn that we have been making mistakes.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.000
So many mistakes we have committed so far.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:45.400
Now are we going to commit more mistakes or are we going to be wise?

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:49.120
Wisdom is not apparent outside.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:54.560
You can't say somebody is wise by looking at that person,

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:59.200
but in vibrations you will know that that person is extremely wise.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.400
He may speak; he may not speak.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:06.840
If he speaks he'll speak about something so deep,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.320
so wise, and so nice, without hurting you.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.000
This kind of a temperament

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:18.480
if you develop is to become wise for every question.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:22.400
For example, some are very attached to their children;

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:27.240
so much attached that they forget that they are part and parcel

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.560
of this divine Force,

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.400
and they just start doing all kinds of things.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:36.800
The other day I met one lady whose son was very sick,

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.040
and she took him to the hospital

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.640
and doctors gave him all kinds of medicines,

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.920
and he became even worse.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.240
Then she telephones to Me, "Mother, I don't know what happened,

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:51.800
I went to the doctor and doctor gave him this and that treatment,

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.080
and the child has become sick."

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.640
But why didn't you ask Me before?

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.400
Why did you go to the hospital first?

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:04.000
Lack of wisdom. I'm there, why don't you ask?

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.640
We had one case here in Cabella.

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:12.240
There was one child who fell down and broke his arm.

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.480
Now the mother didn't show any wisdom.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.640
She took the child to the hospital

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.080
and the doctor said, "Tomorrow we are going to operate her

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:23.120
and put some artificial arm inside."

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:27.640
But the father was sensible. He said, "All right, tomorrow, no?

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.760
Today I'll take the child at home."

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.800
He brought the child to Me in the night about three o'clock.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.080
I said, "All right." I put it right.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.480
Next day when he took it to the hospital the doctor said,

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.640
"But now there's no need to operate because his arm is all right."

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.080
See the difference?

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:48.920
One is worried, immediately they'll go to the doctor,

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:52.880
instead of consulting Me, asking Me. They are Sahaja yogis,

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:57.000
but they will go and ask the doctor to do something or other.

00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:00.760
Once the doctors start doing something then they'll come to Me.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:05.840
There's lots of miracles must have taken place

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.240
about Sahaja Yoga, I must say,

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:12.400
and in that you should see the wisdom helps you.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:16.000
Of course My attention is there always, no doubt,

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:22.480
but still you should not take it for granted; you have to ask.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:26.160
One day, you see, I was just sitting; I just thought

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:31.480
that I should telephone somebody in the ashram of New York.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.600
I never telephone there.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:41.240
So I found out the phone number, we telephoned and asked if ...

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:49.440
I said, "Is the child all right?" So the leader there was surprised,

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.200
because that boy had fallen in the water

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.480
and was in the water for quite some time,

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.880
and he was all filled with water, even his brain was

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:02.960
filled with water. As usual there were some doctors who said

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.800
that he cannot survive and even if he survives,

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:10.320
his brain has so much water that he cannot be normal.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:16.800
So I just said that "Don't worry." I didn't know. Nobody told Me.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:21.160
"Don't worry. The boy will be all right completely."

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:25.120
So they were surprised how I said so.

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.560
Firstly how I knew

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.080
that the boy had fallen, there was some boy like that.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:34.760
And then they didn't know how I said he'll be all right,

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:39.240
and he was all right. He's perfectly all right.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:44.800
So they were surprised at My knowing about it

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:51.720
how is it that Mother knows that there's a boy who is so sick?

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:56.800
Here I will say it is pure knowledge.

00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:00.920
You see, My attention is always around you people

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.720
always dealing with you people.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:09.720
And how I know is this: that this attention of Mine is global

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:14.160
so anything happens to you, any upsetting takes place, any,

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:19.800
I should say, deviation takes place

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.240
My attention is there.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.800
And immediately I know there's something wrong somewhere,

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.960
and I don't know how My attention goes to particular places,

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:33.480
which makes it

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:39.480
life better, it helps people in need.

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.520
I don't do anything about this attention

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.560
but this attention is the wisdom,

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.000
the wisdom that spreads all over.

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:52.920
With that wisdom you know what's wrong with another person

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:57.840
or any other organization that is in Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.120
Everything you come to know.

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:04.360
If you want to know it's different, it just you know.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.640
Like you spread out everywhere.

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.320
For example, if you have to telephone,

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.240
then you have to use the telephone,

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:14.080
but for Me I don't have to use the telephone, I just know.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:18.920
So this has come from a pure innocent wisdom.

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:23.120
The innocent wisdom is just like a child

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.320
It is everywhere, and it communicates

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:31.280
and it tells what's the matter, what's the problem is.

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:35.240
Many people have been cured with Sahaja Yoga, many have been cured.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.440
Now if they can say that "Mother, how did we get cured,

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.520
what have You done? Did You see our chakras?

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:44.360
Did You find out what was wrong with us?"

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:48.480
No, I haven't. I haven't, but I leave it,

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:53.280
in My wisdom I leave it to Paramchaitanya to do the job.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:56.160
This is the main point is, that can you leave

00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:00.800
that can you leave everything to Paramchaitanya in your wisdom?

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.960
If you cannot, then yet you have not felt

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:08.320
the real knowledge within you.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.680
That is the level of some people are.

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:14.520
I am not now so sure about those who get realization

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.520
are all so much filled with pure knowledge.

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.560
Some of them are, but not all of them.

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:26.840
With experience they learn. With meeting people, they learn.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.240
But as the wisdom, pure wisdom, is difficult for them

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:39.560
because they do not rely entirely on the Paramchaitanya.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:45.720
Everything happens, just Paramchaitanya knows,

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.960
it understands, it organizes, it loves,

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:53.680
it does everything. That's the Energy it is. It does everything.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:59.040
And how it manages, how we call coincidences are really organized

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.920
by Paramchaitanya.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:05.640
As I told you yesterday the way the rain was,

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:12.560
the rain came and went away. It has wisdom.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:17.720
Innately it knows I am sitting here, the program is going to start

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.400
stops!

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.320
Flowers know Me.

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.080
You don't know, when we have flowers,

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.920
they are of this size, I don't do anything to them;

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:30.440
they start growing, growing like this, they blast like that.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.160
Now one would say, "Mother, how do they know?"

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:38.080
Because they are natural. We are unnatural.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:42.920
We have taken so many artificialities as part and parcel of life.

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:47.800
See all kinds of courtesies, this, that - all that's not necessary.

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:51.800
All these stupid practices

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.920
that we have adopted sometimes keep us away

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:59.760
from pure knowledge. And when there's no pure knowledge,

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.720
we don't know anything what's happening.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:05.280
We just get frightened for small things, upset for something.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:08.080
I mean it's something very surprising to see

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:11.240
Sahaja yogis getting upset.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:15.280
Among the hundred people if supposing there's a problem,

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:23.800
so if you are a Sahaja yogi you have to just witness, and see.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:28.800
If you cannot do that then you are not a Sahaja yogi.

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:35.240
But it's not like practicing, you know, like they say

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:40.800
if you have to have the blessings of Shiva,

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.160
you must say a hundred-and-eight times His name.

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.160
That's not the way - He doesn't like it.

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:52.240
You see, nobody likes that kind of a murmuring.

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:55.600
You see somebody comes and takes your name all the time

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.000
near your door, you will throw him out.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.600
So that's not the way, this is a wrong idea

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.560
that you go on taking the name of somebody

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:08.760
and that deity will help you.

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:13.840
First of all you have to become wise enough to understand

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.800
that you are a part and parcel of Paramchaitanya.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.000
Everything will work out by that,

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:26.240
and it works out so beautifully.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:30.120
Of course some people have hard time, I don't say they don't have.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:34.680
But it is not hard, because if you are one with Paramchaitanya

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:38.160
and you know that it is doing the job, you are not feeling

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:43.560
that hardness or sickness or anything.

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:47.600
All the people who'll write to Me about their problems,

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.480
I don't know what to say.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:53.240
Could just say that "Do you believe in Paramchaitanya?"

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:58.480
All right. It knows. It knows what is to be done.

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:03.080
It knows what is to be corrected. It knows what is to be said.

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:07.600
See, it can create poetry, it can create music, it can create everything;

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:11.760
but do you leave everything to the Paramchaitanya?

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:14.320
This is the second point in wisdom:

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:19.800
do you have wisdom to leave everything to Paramchaitanya?

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.560
After experiencing also.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:25.400
Like there was one lady who was going in the car

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:31.480
and she found her car and the brakes weren't braking,

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:35.400
and she didn't know what to do. Now if the brakes are no more,

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.840
how will she manage? It was in Germany,

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.560
and all the cars were moving very fast

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:44.120
and she didn't know what to do. So she put her head

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:52.000
on the steering wheel and she said, "I leave it to Paramchaitanya."

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.560
She said, she leaves it to Me - all right, this is the same.

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:59.800
So by saying that, what happened? She said, "Mother I don't know,

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:03.680
when I raised my head I found my car was taken

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:12.920
on one side of the road and nobody was there.

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.160
All the cars were passing by,

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:18.400
but somehow or other this car was taken there

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.160
very nicely by some Force."

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:26.640
So the wisdom lies in understanding the working of Paramchaitanya:

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:31.080
how it guides you, how it helps you, how it preserves you;

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:34.000
how, depending on Paramchaitanya,

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:40.680
you can continue to be living very happily.

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:45.800
I think in Sahaja Yoga we have lost very few Sahaja yogis.

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:49.080
They live for long, they don't die,

00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:53.560
and if you ask their experiences, it's very amazing

00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:56.240
how it works out.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:00.720
If they don't want to live also they can pass,

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:03.960
but if they want to live, Paramchaitanya takes over

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.720
and you can live long.

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:09.480
But living long doesn't mean that you go on bothering yourself

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.240
as to what you will do with your money,

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:16.320
how will you live, what will be the source.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:19.880
All these nonsensical things, worries, come to you, all right.

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:26.240
Then the Paramchaitanya says, "All right, go on worrying."

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:30.240
If you go on worrying, all right go on worrying, doesn't matter.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.960
What will happen?

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.480
Whatever has to happen will happen.

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:38.120
But Paramchaitanya can interfere,

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:41.000
in case you leave it to Paramchaitanya.

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:46.000
It's said many a times, "Leave it to God, leave it to God,"

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:50.640
but "God" means ... I don't know what they mean by God.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.120
God means Paramchaitanya,

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:59.840
God means living divine Force that is working everything.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.880
So the another way of looking at it

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:05.640
is the wisdom that we should understand,

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:11.840
that each and every particle of this world is created by Divine,

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.600
by the divine Force.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:18.560
And this particle and everything is completely under

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:23.560
the guidance and supervision of Paramchaitanya.

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:28.640
Nothing can move unless until Paramchaitanya works on them.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:33.000
It is something so connected; globally it's so much there

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:35.640
that people don't realize

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:40.320
what they are doing, what they should have done.

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:44.840
I mean on many scales you find something happening.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.840
Like supposing something is happening now in America.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:56.120
Just try to find out what America has done to other countries;

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.720
immediately you'll get the answer.

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:02.680
So also it takes

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:07.840
full care of the persons who believe in Paramchaitanya,

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.320
who give everything in the hands of Paramchaitanya.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:15.840
We give things to the police, we'll give to the doctors,

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.160
we give it to the some civil people,

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.800
civil what you call them, engineers

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.480
to do some things.

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:33.320
But they can make mistakes; they can create problems.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:36.080
But you leave it to Paramchaitanya.

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:40.920
It's something so remarkable that in My own life

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:46.320
I have seen that all the time it works for Me.

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:50.560
I was building a house in Pune

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:55.720
and we had to put a slab - very, very big slab

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:59.920
needed about three hundred bags of cement for that.

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:03.520
So I got the cement and I got the people,

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:06.600
but they said, "You're to start early in the morning

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:10.280
and you can finish next morning, twenty-four hours."

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:15.360
I said, "All right." So at about five o'clock I told,

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.760
"Let's go, the work is over."

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.840
They said, "How do you know?" I said, "I know, let's go and see."

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.880
So imagine, which was going to finish

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.080
after twelve hours was already finished

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:29.160
and all the workers were walking about.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.400
And everybody said, "Mother, it's a miracle.

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:35.400
How can such a big slab be laid in such a short time?"

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:38.080
I said, you see, to make them understand I said,

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:41.160
"Must be Hanumana must have done the job."

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.320
But all these people, all these deities

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:46.640
are part and parcel of that Paramchaitanya.

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:49.640
Now you are worshipping the Mother.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.840
To worship the Mother is the biggest thing because

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:57.360
all these deities and everybody are Her children,

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:00.520
under Her command, under Her desire.

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:09.120
So to worship the Mother, the story of as you know about Ganesha,

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.400
that the Mother said that

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:14.560
"The one who goes round the Mother Earth three times,

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:17.760
I will give Him a present."

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.320
So Shri Ganesha thought in His wisdom,

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:24.080
"Who is greater than My Mother? No one else."

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:26.640
Because He knew He cannot compete with His brother

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:35.080
who has got a peacock for a conveyance.

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:42.800
So He said, "How can I go round and win over this person?"

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:47.120
So best is to take to wisdom.

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:51.840
"My Mother is greater than everything else."

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:55.640
So He went around His Mother three times and He got the prize,

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:59.200
and the other brother was just still moving on.

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:03.560
When He came back He found that the present is already lost.

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:09.880
So again and again I'll say it is the wisdom that helps you,

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:14.200
the wisdom to leave everything to Paramchaitanya.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.960
And this is something,

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:20.320
for a modern person, very difficult to understand.

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:22.760
He can't calculate two plus two.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:27.640
He's so bad because of this computers and things like that,

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:30.360
is absolutely hopeless

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:38.600
as far as any mathematical calculations are needed or...

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:41.040
Now I am, I must say,

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:45.240
I don't know how to handle any computer or any calculator;

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:49.840
but if you ask Me just like that, "Mother, how much will it be?"

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:56.000
I'll say so much, and it will be that. It will be that.

00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:01.840
But I am so sure about it, it cannot be anything else but that,

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.800
and it works that way.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:10.360
Sometimes of course, if I want to tell some wrong thing

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:12.480
just to mislead the person

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:16.800
then I may say something, but normally I know it is that.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.880
But I know not like the way we know;

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:24.400
I just know it, that's what it is, just know it.

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:32.080
So I am not saying that you develop your knowledge to that extent

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:35.280
that you can do it, but your wisdom.

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:39.360
If you start using your wisdom, it will always come handy.

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:44.320
In anything that you do, think of the wisdom.

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:48.680
My advice to you is

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:55.000
that as your Mother loves the whole world, loves all of you,

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:59.080
and cares for those who haven't even got realization,

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:05.320
you should also strive to create more people for Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:09.160
But in that if you start behaving in a manner all the time saying,

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:13.160
"You are catching this, you are a bhoot, you are this, you are that."

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:19.160
I never said that to anyone, so you shouldn't say like that.

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:22.440
That's no love, that's no understanding.

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:27.200
The understanding is that you were just the same as the person was

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.400
and now you are knowledgeable,

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:33.400
so you must use your knowledge to correct that person,

00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:36.760
not to put him down.

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:40.160
And that correction is also not verbal;

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:44.840
it's just through your vibrations you can correct the other person.

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:49.400
Most of the Sahaja Yoga work sometimes I've seen that it stops

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:53.920
because we are very methodical, we become like great teachers,

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:59.680
we start telling them stories, and then they get fed up with you.

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:04.480
So when you are handling other people, as I said,

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.240
we have to spread the knowledge, very important,

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:09.640
we cannot keep it to ourselves.

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:13.440
But it's not for any ambition, for any leadership,

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:15.320
for any kind of recognition;

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:21.920
but just the use of our wisdom, use of our knowledge

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:25.800
that we want to help others out of love.

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:29.720
Not for any recognition, not for any position, nothing.

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:33.000
Just we want to do it because we love them.

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:38.840
And I am sure this will work out very effectively.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000
And the person who will be helped, or the persons who will be helped

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:46.400
will be just, be bound to you

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:49.320
because they find the true knowledge.

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.400
But supposing somebody comes to you and says

00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:53.400
"I know the true knowledge."

00:43:53.560 --> 00:44:00.480
You say, "You might be knowing, but I have to know what you know."

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:04.680
Then you ask that person; then he'll give you a big lecture.

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.760
You should say, "No, that's not the thing."

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:09.320
Just smile. Say, "That's not the thing."

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:17.120
The thing is, true knowledge is a part and parcel of your being.

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:25.880
It's just within you. It is not some sort of a concrete stuff

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.040
that you have read or you have understood,

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:32.240
but it just has become a light within you,

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:37.560
and that light is there. It has no ...

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:41.480
it's no necessity for you to be very well educated,

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.160
or to be very intelligent,

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:46.520
or to be very highly placed, not necessary.

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:52.400
It is how your heart is clean.

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.640
In the heart it resides.

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.560
Imagine, all other knowledge resides in the brain,

00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:02.080
while the pure knowledge resides in the heart. Very surprising.

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:08.400
But we do not know also that actually our heart rules the head.

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:14.280
There are seven auras around the heart which control the brain

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:19.840
in such a manner that we act in the hands of the Paramchaitanya.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.080
Unless and until your heart is clean,

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:28.480
unless and until in your heart you have a beautiful image

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:39.200
of a person who is very, very pure,

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:44.400
you cannot, you cannot do anything mentally.

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:48.240
And from your heart if you have to do, your heart has to be

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:52.240
very clean and extremely wise.

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:57.800
This is the point one has to jump into: that your heart, is it wise?

00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:01.920
For example, to get attached to someone too much,

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:06.480
identified with some much shows that your heart is not clean.

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:09.800
It has so many bondages.

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:13.200
Open your heart, fully.

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:18.720
And that's why they say that the Goddess resides in the Heart,

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:20.960
in the center Heart.

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:26.080
She resides in the center Heart because She's so balanced.

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:29.640
She resides in the center Heart as Shakti,

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:34.960
and She gives you all that you want.

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:38.800
Within you She's settled down as many things.

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:40.920
You know the Shlokas which says

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:46.720
that She's settled within us like knowledge,

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:50.160
She's settled within us as memory,

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:52.800
She is settled within us as sleep,

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:58.880
also She's settled within us as illusion, bhranti.

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.560
She's the one who puts us into illusions

00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:06.920
because we are not yet fully perfected.

00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:20.080
We have to become paripakwa - means absolutely, absolutely matured.

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:25.000
Till we are matured this Mother Herself puts you into illusions

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:29.080
and plays around, so that you learn how to be wise.

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:32.280
So one should understand that She's playing around with you.

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:35.360
And you should try to be very careful

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:39.440
and not to be falling into Her maya,

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:41.640
because if She puts you in the maya,

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:45.280
you'll go round and round and you will reach nowhere.

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:50.000
So this power of bhranti is also very important,

00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:55.120
this delusion you can call it, or else you can call it

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.840
a thing by which She creates a drama,

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:05.760
in which you become like a stupid man being found out.

00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:09.680
So this stupidity and all that

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:15.000
can be removed by this bhranti that She creates.

00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:21.160
And this power of bhranti is because of human beings as they are,

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:25.480
because they will not understand something straightforward;

00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:27.480
so it has to go round and round,

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:29.240
till they reach a point to understand

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:32.280
that it was the play of the Mother

00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:37.000
that brought them to this shore of wisdom.

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:41.520
So for us it is important to see that

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:46.080
so much has been done by Paramchaitanya for us,

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:48.680
the Mother has done so much for us.

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:52.840
Now what are we going to do ourselves

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:56.480
to get all these powers that She has given us,

00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:00.200
to be completely enlightened and developed?

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:02.640
What have we done so far?

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:15.320
Nothing to be done as such but to develop a kind of a deep devotion,

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:21.960
deep understanding; and that depth is possible, absolutely possible,

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:27.240
because now you are on your way to that perfection.

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:30.840
So today in Cabella is the last puja,

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.360
and I want to tell you as a Mother

00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:38.960
that you all should depend on Paramchaitanya.

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:43.120
That's very important, to depend on Paramchaitanya.

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:46.560
Also there's a habit of many people

00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:48.840
to put the blame on others, like,

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.360
"I got caught up from this person and got caught up from that person."

00:49:53.520 --> 00:50:01.200
You are caught up by yourself only. All such ideas are of no use.

00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:02.680
Face yourself,

00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:04.400
find out about yourself,

00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:08.280
and you have to perfect yourself. That's so important,

00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:11.360
because at this juncture of the time

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:14.680
people think that something great is going to happen.

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:16.400
I don't know.

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:20.320
Two thousand years according to them would be something great,

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:23.640
but I don't know, because is all man-made,

00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:27.480
all this two thousand year and three thousand year is man-made.

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:33.600
But I Myself feel, as predicted by many, that possibly

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:38.280
because of your understanding and your wisdom

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:42.080
I'm sure something great may happen in this world,

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:46.720
and things may be brought to a proper level

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:49.280
of understanding of spirituality.

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:53.080
Because this is the Last Judgment, and in this Last Judgment

00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:58.480
you have to play a very vital role, which I am sure you can do it,

00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:03.800
if you decide to achieve something for the future.

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:06.760
May God bless you.
