00:00:04,341 --> 00:00:12,338
Adi Shakti Puja. Nirmal Nagari, Canajoharie, NY (USA),
2 July 2000.

2
00:00:13,128 --> 00:00:18,320
Today we have come here to do the Adi Shakti Puja.

3
00:00:20,651 --> 00:00:28,064
I have already told you about the Adi Shakti,  how

4
00:00:30,485 --> 00:00:36,236
She had to work out so many things in this world —

5
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:43,663
first to create and then

6
00:00:46,084 --> 00:00:50,023
to create human beings through evolutionary process.

7
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:55,566
After that, to comfort.

8
00:00:58,661 --> 00:01:04,456
Then to counsel.

9
00:01:05,794 --> 00:01:12,273
So many people here came on this Earth just to do the counselling.

10
00:01:14,011 --> 00:01:17,875
They told what was wrong, what was right,

11
00:01:18,403 --> 00:01:21,943
what should we do, what we should not do,

12
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:29,443
what is self-respect and what is the

13
00:01:32,514 --> 00:01:38,979
duty of a human being as a superior-most creature.

14
00:01:40,072 --> 00:01:41,976
So many of Them came on this Earth.

15
00:01:42,865 --> 00:01:46,677
One after another, in every country, They came

16
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,898
and Their counselling formed religions.

17
00:01:53,542 --> 00:01:56,544
Of course, you see the mess of the religions

18
00:01:56,785 --> 00:01:59,697
and that’s how Their life was wasted,

19
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:06,466
that They formed religions after religions,

20
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:13,744
by which only human beings were divided,

21
00:02:16,465 --> 00:02:20,983
divided to such an extent they hate each other.

22
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:26,519
Hateful, somebody’s born in an X religion,

23
00:02:27,351 --> 00:02:31,755
he hates the person who follows the Y religion.

24
00:02:32,728 --> 00:02:35,785
While Those who came as counsellors

25
00:02:36,762 --> 00:02:39,955
talked about complete unity,

26
00:02:40,896 --> 00:02:43,777
complete oneness of human race,

27
00:02:44,089 --> 00:02:50,339
despite that, human brain, in its freedom,

28
00:02:50,992 --> 00:02:54,605
did all kinds of wrong things

29
00:02:55,211 --> 00:03:00,062
and created a country or,

30
00:03:00,256 --> 00:03:06,626
you can say the whole world, full of lots of problems

31
00:03:06,992 --> 00:03:10,407
arising out of religion.

32
00:03:11,443 --> 00:03:18,002
How can it be that religion makes you hate somebody?

33
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:23,509
Religion is there to understand love,

34
00:03:23,901 --> 00:03:26,877
imbibe love and compassion.

35
00:03:29,817 --> 00:03:37,706
So the third thing one had to do is the Adi Shakti’s job,

36
00:03:39,091 --> 00:03:42,585
that is the one Kundalini within us.

37
00:03:44,327 --> 00:03:51,679
And, by the awakening, we got pure knowledge, absolute knowledge,

38
00:03:52,821 --> 00:03:57,521
pure knowledge that it cannot be challenged.

39
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:00,802
Absolute it is!

40
00:04:01,718 --> 00:04:06,077
Whatever you know after Realization is absolute.

41
00:04:08,256 --> 00:04:13,197
If you know that, then what you have to understand,

42
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:19,409
that everything has to be united.

43
00:04:21,206 --> 00:04:27,607
You cannot have fights and you cannot hate anyone.

44
00:04:28,796 --> 00:04:31,835
If that thing starts happening,

45
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:37,063
all the problems of the world will be finished.

46
00:04:37,556 --> 00:04:40,344
So the first thing, redemption,

47
00:04:40,743 --> 00:04:44,092
that is the quality of the Adi Shakti,

48
00:04:44,905 --> 00:04:52,074
was to redeem people of their all wrong ideas about others.

49
00:04:53,517 --> 00:04:58,209
Firstly, as we know, there are six enemies we have got.

50
00:04:59,745 --> 00:05:05,400
And unless and until we can conquer those six enemies,

51
00:05:05,832 --> 00:05:09,627
we cannot be a religious person. That is what is said,

52
00:05:09,992 --> 00:05:14,073
but actually the all religions are based only

53
00:05:14,284 --> 00:05:19,153
on prospering those six enemies that we have within ourselves.

54
00:05:21,836 --> 00:05:24,824
When you see this clearly, you start seeking,

55
00:05:25,134 --> 00:05:28,046
you start seeking, seeking

56
00:05:30,007 --> 00:05:34,215
earnest, the Truth.

57
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:39,154
And the revelation of truth,

58
00:05:39,575 --> 00:05:44,744
absolute truth, can only come through your evolution,

59
00:05:44,904 --> 00:05:46,877
through your reformation

60
00:05:47,203 --> 00:05:53,833
that you become person who knows the Truth.

61
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:59,538
For that, Adi Shakti’s ascent is important within you,

62
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,491
which is your Kundalini.

63
00:06:02,314 --> 00:06:05,607
And when this thing takes place,

64
00:06:06,803 --> 00:06:11,239
automatically you drop all those six enemies that you have.

65
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:18,987
You become a beautiful human being.

66
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,794
Like lotus, when it is in the very germinating state,

67
00:06:26,521 --> 00:06:30,822
it looks like all other small

68
00:06:34,235 --> 00:06:38,537
animals, or small, you can say, very, very,

69
00:06:38,764 --> 00:06:41,382
small dirty things that are in the pond.

70
00:06:43,793 --> 00:06:46,574
And then, once it starts coming out,

71
00:06:47,471 --> 00:06:54,525
coming out of that horrible water,

72
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:58,982
it becomes such a beautiful flower,

73
00:06:59,692 --> 00:07:05,078
rises up and opens out.
In the same way, a Sahaja Yogi,

74
00:07:05,562 --> 00:07:11,720
though he lives along with all these horrible things
that are going on,

75
00:07:12,873 --> 00:07:16,359
but flowers like a lotus.

76
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:19,897
It doesn’t have all these insects,

77
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:25,082
all this dirt and filth of that water in which it lives.

78
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:30,232
It sucks only the pure water

79
00:07:30,821 --> 00:07:35,776
and the remnant, the others remain there as it is.

80
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:39,250
So what is left within you

81
00:07:39,695 --> 00:07:45,048
is nothing but purity, beauty and fragrance,

82
00:07:46,315 --> 00:07:49,140
just like a lotus.

83
00:07:50,755 --> 00:07:56,887
Then there is no more the problem of getting attacked

84
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:02,209
by all of these small, small creatures in the water

85
00:08:02,848 --> 00:08:06,181
or all the dirty things that are in the water.

86
00:08:09,553 --> 00:08:13,151
And this state that you have achieved now,

87
00:08:13,923 --> 00:08:18,544
I’m very happy to see so many people in America have achieved it.

88
00:08:19,952 --> 00:08:22,302
You see, it’s a very great blessing,

89
00:08:22,917 --> 00:08:28,476
because America is the leading country in so many ways.

90
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:33,798
One can say that it has made lots of money.

91
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:40,893
That is not the criteria of becoming a very good Sahaja Yogi.

92
00:08:42,582 --> 00:08:45,573
What you get is the satisfaction,

93
00:08:46,514 --> 00:08:54,359
satisfaction that you enjoy whatever you have
and whatever others have.

94
00:08:56,405 --> 00:08:59,431
And the second thing that happens to you,

95
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:02,145
you become absolutely collective.

96
00:09:02,982 --> 00:09:05,180
This has to happen.

97
00:09:06,153 --> 00:09:12,099
But I find still people have not understood
the meaning of collectivity.

98
00:09:12,938 --> 00:09:18,503
For example, family is very, very weak here.

99
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:27,401
Family that has been created by natural relationships

100
00:09:28,027 --> 00:09:31,836
is not so much respected as it should have.

101
00:09:32,983 --> 00:09:37,587
It’s all because, based on money, so people start

102
00:09:39,869 --> 00:09:43,915
quarrelling, fighting and even killing each other.

103
00:09:46,756 --> 00:09:52,503
Now the basis of family is love and compassion.

104
00:09:53,247 --> 00:09:57,322
Those who do not have this cannot have good families.

105
00:09:58,496 --> 00:10:01,627
I’ve seen even among Sahaja Yogis sometimes,

106
00:10:01,957 --> 00:10:05,615
some people who are working for money,

107
00:10:06,494 --> 00:10:11,802
who are educated, sometimes look down upon people

108
00:10:12,444 --> 00:10:14,578
who are not so well off.

109
00:10:14,817 --> 00:10:18,660
Or maybe the housewives who are working in the house,

110
00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:22,836
looking after the children, building up the families

111
00:10:22,994 --> 00:10:29,517
are not treated with respect as some secretary in the

112
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,153
some organization.

113
00:10:34,744 --> 00:10:38,847
I don’t know why this kind of a manliness comes into women.

114
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:43,044
Why should they think they are something higher

115
00:10:43,224 --> 00:10:45,770
than the women who are working hard

116
00:10:45,914 --> 00:10:50,566
in the household, cooking, looking after children,

117
00:10:51,092 --> 00:10:55,910
bearing all the brunt of the society.

118
00:10:57,482 --> 00:11:03,172
This is something, I feel, is a part which is lacking very much

119
00:11:03,467 --> 00:11:07,333
in America and also Western countries.

120
00:11:08,313 --> 00:11:10,873
When money becomes important,

121
00:11:11,566 --> 00:11:13,981
if when money is important,

122
00:11:14,277 --> 00:11:20,306
then the Lakshmi principle is not respected.

123
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:22,338
Very surprising.

124
00:11:22,447 --> 00:11:26,119
Money is the part which is the blessing of the Lakshmi,

125
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:28,547
but the Gruha Lakshmi is the one

126
00:11:28,663 --> 00:11:31,975
who is a householder, is not respected.

127
00:11:33,186 --> 00:11:35,681
And with this, I tell you,

128
00:11:36,315 --> 00:11:40,679
there’s a… very, very wrong things can happen.

129
00:11:41,646 --> 00:11:45,423
You can work, you can be educated,

130
00:11:45,783 --> 00:11:49,678
but you should be able to look after your family

131
00:11:50,054 --> 00:11:55,304
and look after their comfort and look after their unity.

132
00:11:56,651 --> 00:12:00,035
Instead of that, educated women,

133
00:12:00,258 --> 00:12:03,258
I call them manly women,

134
00:12:03,561 --> 00:12:08,213
educated women think that they are something higher,
they are sadly mistaken.

135
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:12,698
In no way, a man is higher than a woman.

136
00:12:13,752 --> 00:12:16,772
So this kind of a disparity that exists

137
00:12:17,343 --> 00:12:20,739
and one starts thinking that: “We are earning.

138
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,887
We are educated”

139
00:12:23,306 --> 00:12:26,355
are really manly women, I must say.

140
00:12:27,193 --> 00:12:31,470
But the women who work very hard in a household with love,

141
00:12:32,565 --> 00:12:36,496
look after the children, look after the family,

142
00:12:36,813 --> 00:12:41,393
are in no way less than these people who are working in the office.

143
00:12:42,597 --> 00:12:45,359
So, such women must be respected

144
00:12:45,964 --> 00:12:49,267
by their husbands, by the men,

145
00:12:49,592 --> 00:12:51,899
members  of the family — not only that,

146
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:55,310
but all the Sahaja Yogis must respect such women,

147
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:58,866
who are doing such a difficult task.

148
00:12:59,731 --> 00:13:03,013
I’ve been a housewife and I know what it is

149
00:13:04,038 --> 00:13:07,534
to run the house, to look after the children,

150
00:13:07,831 --> 00:13:11,940
to look after the complete organization

151
00:13:12,388 --> 00:13:16,261
and looking after the expenditure

152
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:19,593
of the money, if that is limited.

153
00:13:20,998 --> 00:13:24,374
This ego has to go.

154
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:29,818
The other day, one lady, she came in interview and asked Me

155
00:13:30,034 --> 00:13:35,761
that: “How is it, in this world of men, you are so much respected?”

156
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:41,458
World of men —I was really laughing.

157
00:13:41,826 --> 00:13:46,059
What makes her think that is the world of men, I can’t understand.

158
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:48,979
Can they exist without women?”

159
00:13:49,491 --> 00:13:54,273
But I was amazed at her question because she said

160
00:13:54,414 --> 00:13:59,321
that: “Even in the jail, criminals are so much respectful,

161
00:13:59,804 --> 00:14:01,491
how is it possible?

162
00:14:01,686 --> 00:14:05,523
How can they have so much respect for a women?”

163
00:14:06,316 --> 00:14:10,080
I said: “I can’t understand one thing,

164
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:14,068
that criminals have got mothers or not?”

165
00:14:16,361 --> 00:14:19,318
They are all males, don’t they have a mother?

166
00:14:19,794 --> 00:14:24,770
They all have a mother and they respect the mother.

167
00:14:25,997 --> 00:14:28,044
That’s the point one should know,

168
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:32,437
that woman is a much more important thing

169
00:14:32,731 --> 00:14:37,189
than the man is, as far as the children are concerned.

170
00:14:38,674 --> 00:14:42,482
But I’ve seen even some ladies,

171
00:14:42,603 --> 00:14:46,204
who think they are very capable, try to control everything

172
00:14:46,911 --> 00:14:48,785
and create problems.

173
00:14:50,326 --> 00:14:53,414
And mother’s job is not to control.

174
00:14:54,163 --> 00:14:57,590
Her job is to love, to give compassion

175
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:01,275
and this is the quality of women is lost

176
00:15:01,491 --> 00:15:04,434
in these Western, so-called advanced,

177
00:15:05,855 --> 00:15:09,201
It is a very dangerous thing. I personally think

178
00:15:09,511 --> 00:15:14,177
that, if such a thing happens, families will be destroyed.

179
00:15:14,437 --> 00:15:19,752
Nobody will have respect for the lady who looks after the family.

180
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:24,633
And she is more than a prime minister, I would say, in a family

181
00:15:25,088 --> 00:15:28,427
and she’s to be respected and to be understood.

182
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:33,662
Today, I think it is important to say

183
00:15:34,103 --> 00:15:38,559
that all of you should understand the value of women

184
00:15:38,861 --> 00:15:40,829
who are housewives.

185
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,644
It’s a tremendous job

186
00:15:44,746 --> 00:15:48,021
to be a housewife. I have gone through it and I know what it is.

187
00:15:50,321 --> 00:15:53,465
If the respect for the housewife is not given…

188
00:15:54,597 --> 00:15:59,292
She will also look after the children.

189
00:16:00,641 --> 00:16:02,948
Children are tomorrow’s citizens.

190
00:16:03,331 --> 00:16:06,901
Who will groom them? Who will bring them up?

191
00:16:07,996 --> 00:16:11,415
All those manly women don’t also have children sometimes,

192
00:16:11,906 --> 00:16:14,588
so they don’t know what is the problem of children.

193
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:18,915
At least those who are solving the problem of their children,

194
00:16:19,001 --> 00:16:22,334
you must understand their responsibility.

195
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:28,132
This is a very, very crucial point, I think on which

196
00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:31,627
all the Western societies are collapsing,

197
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:35,442
because in their culture there is no place for the mother.

198
00:16:39,544 --> 00:16:42,429
So, the women should not feel in any way less

199
00:16:42,624 --> 00:16:45,437
if they are mothers and looking after the household.

200
00:16:45,632 --> 00:16:48,169
They should not feel inferior to anybody

201
00:16:48,285 --> 00:16:51,660
who thinks that they are something great.

202
00:16:53,384 --> 00:16:56,896
Basically, the families have to be good.

203
00:16:57,689 --> 00:17:01,028
This collectivity must work first in the family.

204
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,454
The children are to be groomed properly.

205
00:17:04,887 --> 00:17:07,410
They are to be brought up in a proper way.

206
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:10,677
As it is, in these days, you know what is happening to the children.

207
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:15,069
When I read about it, I’m really shocked that

208
00:17:16,195 --> 00:17:20,824
children are just treated as if they’re some unwanted stuff.

209
00:17:21,952 --> 00:17:24,470
They are not given any attention.

210
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:29,835
Ultimately, the children become drug addicts,

211
00:17:30,196 --> 00:17:33,628
they become vagabonds or anything. They can become anything,

212
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:37,205
because there’s so much, so much neglect

213
00:17:37,422 --> 00:17:40,494
and so much of hatred for children.

214
00:17:42,185 --> 00:17:46,649
So one has to first remember that, for collectivity,

215
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,918
you must look after your children.

216
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,366
Not only that, with love and compassion,

217
00:17:58,584 --> 00:18:04,915
not as somebody who is trying to become a despot out of it,

218
00:18:05,348 --> 00:18:09,770
but a person who is a source,

219
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:13,700
who is a source of joy and compassion.

220
00:18:15,264 --> 00:18:19,101
In one of My lectures, I talked to you about

221
00:18:19,245 --> 00:18:22,671
the emotional intelligence.

222
00:18:25,699 --> 00:18:28,382
That is what we should try to imbibe.

223
00:18:29,097 --> 00:18:32,774
Emotional intelligence, that means

224
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,065
the intelligence that is based on emotions.

225
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:42,798
Unless and until we become emotionally intelligent,

226
00:18:42,935 --> 00:18:44,991
our society cannot work.

227
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:50,212
In an emotional intelligence, you care

228
00:18:50,981 --> 00:18:53,308
and you enjoy caring.

229
00:18:54,232 --> 00:18:59,043
You do everything for others

230
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:03,341
with a great emotional understanding.

231
00:19:03,515 --> 00:19:06,484
Not for one child, not for one son,

232
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:12,298
but for everyone you have to be emotionally intelligent.

233
00:19:13,761 --> 00:19:17,411
Some children are born like this, but some are to be made like that,

234
00:19:17,901 --> 00:19:21,197
that they should be emotionally intelligent.

235
00:19:22,873 --> 00:19:28,030
Because, if the mother and father are money-oriented,

236
00:19:28,672 --> 00:19:33,402
very selfish, they wouldn’t allow their child

237
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:36,092
to give anything to others.

238
00:19:36,706 --> 00:19:41,429
So such a child will grow into a very funny type of a person

239
00:19:42,144 --> 00:19:46,953
and will never do anything for anybody not even for his own country.

240
00:19:47,278 --> 00:19:51,215
Why should he? Everything for selfishness.

241
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:55,672
Then such people indulge into corruption,

242
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,758
indulge into all kinds of things,

243
00:19:58,953 --> 00:20:02,970
which are only selfish in attitude.

244
00:20:04,462 --> 00:20:07,117
Now we are talking of collectivity.

245
00:20:07,816 --> 00:20:11,104
In collectivity, we do for others.

246
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,450
We enjoy doing for others.

247
00:20:15,237 --> 00:20:19,231
We love giving things to others, not for yourself,

248
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:22,953
because your children will also become the same kind

249
00:20:23,148 --> 00:20:25,636
and they will only bother about themselves.

250
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:32,912
This emotional intelligence has to be brought in our life.

251
00:20:33,497 --> 00:20:38,147
In our pattern that we have, are we emotionally

252
00:20:38,956 --> 00:20:45,114
intelligent or we are just intelligent or emotional?

253
00:20:46,008 --> 00:20:47,608
Both things are wrong.

254
00:20:47,897 --> 00:20:51,381
If you are just intelligent, you can become very dry person.

255
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:57,590
You may just have few friends maybe, you may not have

256
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,190
and you will always try to preserve yourself away

257
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,925
from the collectivity.

258
00:21:05,803 --> 00:21:09,922
And if you are emotional, you’ll be attached to only one person,

259
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:15,446
attached to one child, attached to one person,

260
00:21:15,806 --> 00:21:18,893
to someone, even in the society.

261
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,653
For no rhyme or reason. Why? Why are you attached to one person?

262
00:21:25,629 --> 00:21:28,643
Why you bothered about one person only?

263
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:32,869
All such people fall into such terrible play.

264
00:21:33,287 --> 00:21:35,471
In the politics you have seen how,

265
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,772
people try to help their own sons

266
00:21:37,873 --> 00:21:40,326
and own daughters and this and that.

267
00:21:40,427 --> 00:21:43,016
And we Indians have suffered a lot with this

268
00:21:43,325 --> 00:21:46,088
kind of an emotional attachment.

269
00:21:51,178 --> 00:21:56,096
So, according to ethics,

270
00:21:57,134 --> 00:22:02,191
emotional intelligence is the highest quality,

271
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:07,484
by which you give to others,

272
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:12,701
you care for others, for everyone

273
00:22:13,934 --> 00:22:17,028
and you become very, very collective.

274
00:22:20,677 --> 00:22:24,556
Now exclusiveness is another fashion

275
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,327
that’s very miserable, it’s exclusive.

276
00:22:28,069 --> 00:22:30,914
because you don’t want to be one of the multitudes.

277
00:22:31,023 --> 00:22:33,341
You want to be exclusive.

278
00:22:34,318 --> 00:22:41,926
You should be exclusive in emotional intelligence,
not on other things.

279
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:45,670
That is the best thing that you can have.

280
00:22:46,044 --> 00:22:50,227
As I agree, I am just a woman and just a mother,

281
00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:57,209
but what I have is really the emotional intelligence,

282
00:22:57,627 --> 00:23:03,988
ocean of it, and from that I know about everyone,

283
00:23:05,703 --> 00:23:07,895
I understand about everyone.

284
00:23:08,552 --> 00:23:13,752
And all this work has been done because of that quality in My head.

285
00:23:14,106 --> 00:23:19,535
I’m not attached to one person or to one style.

286
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:24,244
Whatever you say, I can understand,

287
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,125
because I am at a level

288
00:23:26,263 --> 00:23:30,166
where I can understand everything that you are doing.

289
00:23:31,146 --> 00:23:36,396
To achieve that, you try to develop emotional intelligence.

290
00:23:37,246 --> 00:23:41,624
Here the children won’t even give a toy to somebody to play with.

291
00:23:43,852 --> 00:23:48,503
Even the mother is like that, the father is like that,
extremely selfish

292
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:53,528
and: “We must have our own, you see, everything should be our own.”

293
00:23:54,631 --> 00:24:00,378
This has to go. This has to go, from Americans especially, because

294
00:24:00,515 --> 00:24:05,796
they are the leading nation in this kind of selfishness.

295
00:24:08,377 --> 00:24:12,048
What selfishness they have done, I need not count,
but you know that.

296
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:15,956
You go and ask the people of Canada, Mexico,

297
00:24:16,165 --> 00:24:18,502
Peru, all this, they will tell you.

298
00:24:19,396 --> 00:24:22,317
Being selfish, they are not ashamed.

299
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,922
They are exploiters, they are not ashamed.

300
00:24:28,475 --> 00:24:33,769
Nobody can even tell them,
because they think they are very rich people.

301
00:24:35,052 --> 00:24:40,115
But all these riches will not give them the joy of life.

302
00:24:41,586 --> 00:24:46,974
Joy of life is only in the emotional intelligence.

303
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:51,170
If you don’t have that, it becomes very dry.

304
00:24:51,372 --> 00:24:54,949
Life becomes very odd, unbearable, horrible

305
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:59,954
and even the family gets broken,

306
00:25:00,805 --> 00:25:03,833
if there is no emotional intelligence in the family.

307
00:25:04,883 --> 00:25:07,075
I have known so many women

308
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:10,004
who have had three marriages, five marriages.

309
00:25:10,105 --> 00:25:11,728
I don’t know how they can do it.

310
00:25:11,965 --> 00:25:16,120
But they’ve done because of this lack of emotional intelligence.

311
00:25:17,705 --> 00:25:22,307
It is something that is a sense of giving.

312
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:27,175
It's not that your sacrifising anything, no.

313
00:25:27,421 --> 00:25:29,050
That’s also another idea,

314
00:25:29,187 --> 00:25:32,223
that we are to bear this —nothing of the kind.

315
00:25:33,586 --> 00:25:36,470
Look at the life of Christ, He gave His life.

316
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,650
Why? What was the need for Him to do that?

317
00:25:40,531 --> 00:25:42,802
Behind Him was the Truth.

318
00:25:43,617 --> 00:25:46,819
When you have the Truth with you, the light of the Truth,

319
00:25:46,931 --> 00:25:49,834
the force of the Truth, the strength of the Truth,

320
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:53,466
you become emotionally intelligent.

321
00:25:55,043 --> 00:25:58,586
You understand that, if you really love something,

322
00:25:58,752 --> 00:26:04,492
then you have to undergo every kind of trouble.

323
00:26:04,948 --> 00:26:07,304
You have to tolerate lot of nonsense.

324
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:09,287
I know it’s too much to say,

325
00:26:09,431 --> 00:26:15,804
but I thought that, for this special Puja, I should say something

326
00:26:15,963 --> 00:26:17,766
about the family life.

327
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:22,462
In our ashrams or in our programs

328
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:26,911
or wherever we are, we should remember this point,

329
00:26:27,207 --> 00:26:32,918
that: “Are we having that emotional intelligence

330
00:26:33,055 --> 00:26:35,623
when we are trying to talk among Sahaja Yoga?”

331
00:26:37,476 --> 00:26:41,724
Why do I need to be every place to tell them? What is the need?

332
00:26:42,264 --> 00:26:43,836
You can tell them.

333
00:26:44,226 --> 00:26:47,378
If you have that emotional intelligence,

334
00:26:47,724 --> 00:26:50,550
everybody will listen to you. Why not?

335
00:26:50,814 --> 00:26:53,338
Not necessary I should go everywhere

336
00:26:53,472 --> 00:26:56,257
and talk to them. How many countries can I do?

337
00:26:57,151 --> 00:26:59,696
And the reaction to it is so beautiful

338
00:26:59,927 --> 00:27:03,043
and so nice. It’s very surprising.

339
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:07,218
Like in a country like Benin country, all Muslims there,

340
00:27:07,536 --> 00:27:12,424
all black people, they all have become Sahaja Yogis. Nine thousand.

341
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:16,524
How could I capture that?

342
00:27:17,026 --> 00:27:21,106
Just think of that. Nine thousand people come to you!

343
00:27:21,718 --> 00:27:24,754
Then also other countries I have seen.

344
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:29,204
Just this is the power of emotional intelligence

345
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:31,850
that captures the heart of the people.

346
00:27:33,156 --> 00:27:37,790
You may have any amount of property, money, everything,

347
00:27:37,978 --> 00:27:40,992
people will abhor you. Alright.

348
00:27:41,649 --> 00:27:44,252
So you may say: “What’s wrong? What’s wrong with this?”

349
00:27:44,597 --> 00:27:52,978
That you are harming the greatest thing, is the human being.

350
00:27:54,811 --> 00:27:58,113
And the politicians they are horrible, as they say.

351
00:27:58,748 --> 00:28:01,957
Why? Because they have no emotional intelligence.

352
00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:09,782
Also as administrators, they are very much difficult,

353
00:28:09,876 --> 00:28:12,133
because they have no emotional intelligence.

354
00:28:14,331 --> 00:28:19,135
All these people are devoid of that great quality

355
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:21,385
of emotional intelligence.

356
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:24,904
If your country is very progressive,

357
00:28:25,048 --> 00:28:28,633
I must say, you must progress in emotional intelligence.

358
00:28:29,488 --> 00:28:31,897
That way, they have philanthropists, I know.

359
00:28:32,383 --> 00:28:34,719
Americans are known to be philanthropists.

360
00:28:35,066 --> 00:28:38,815
But behind that is they want to have power.

361
00:28:41,815 --> 00:28:44,252
They want to rule people with that money.

362
00:28:45,586 --> 00:28:50,246
It’s not emotional intelligence, it’s they just want to rule.

363
00:28:50,671 --> 00:28:54,024
If they start some sort of a charity,

364
00:28:54,543 --> 00:28:58,668
that is just to have a big name on the television,

365
00:28:58,906 --> 00:29:04,575
or to have a very great advertisement about, “Oh, him!”

366
00:29:04,778 --> 00:29:07,900
and then he moves like a tycoon all over.

367
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,961
We part of their  [UNCLEAR]   we part of their property

368
00:29:13,676 --> 00:29:16,906
work it out and make such a fuss about it,

369
00:29:17,187 --> 00:29:20,000
because they want to cash everything…

370
00:29:20,209 --> 00:29:22,575
Cash has been lots of cashed  in

371
00:29:23,542 --> 00:29:25,702
You are Sahaja Yogis.

372
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,425
You have to send waves of emotional intelligence.

373
00:29:30,923 --> 00:29:35,041
You have to send love to all over the world.

374
00:29:35,653 --> 00:29:39,771
You have to show how you can, with love, win over.

375
00:29:40,442 --> 00:29:44,430
It is also possible, if you are not so attached.

376
00:29:44,898 --> 00:29:48,194
If you are attached, say to your country only—

377
00:29:48,491 --> 00:29:50,171
now this is a bigger issue —

378
00:29:50,392 --> 00:29:54,281
then you will try to exploit other countries,

379
00:29:54,578 --> 00:29:57,974
take advantage of them, try to run them down.

380
00:29:58,247 --> 00:30:01,016
But if you are emotionally attached to your country,

381
00:30:01,241 --> 00:30:05,683
then you’ll bring good name to your country by doing real good work.

382
00:30:07,009 --> 00:30:10,709
I don’t know why people do not know how to discriminate.

383
00:30:11,459 --> 00:30:14,596
Why are they so selfish, trying to bring them up,

384
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,897
trying to do all the good things for themselves?

385
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:26,761
There is a very great chance for all of you

386
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:30,525
to get this within your reach,

387
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:32,856
because you are all Sahaja Yogis.

388
00:30:33,223 --> 00:30:35,336
You have become like lotuses.

389
00:30:35,646 --> 00:30:39,455
And the lotus has the fragrance which spreads all over

390
00:30:40,426 --> 00:30:44,401
and, days together it stays in the water, in that dirty water,

391
00:30:44,689 --> 00:30:47,509
and it spreads the fragrance.

392
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:50,943
With that fragrance also, you can do lots of things,

393
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:55,283
that the bees come there, they sleep in that

394
00:30:56,192 --> 00:30:59,040
beautiful house of the lotus

395
00:30:59,494 --> 00:31:03,353
and in the night it closes down very carefully.

396
00:31:03,684 --> 00:31:06,569
All kinds of things that come from the flower

397
00:31:10,964 --> 00:31:22,783
to take the beauty

398
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,770
of that flower,

399
00:31:25,097 --> 00:31:28,971
we can say, because you can extract also

400
00:31:29,112 --> 00:31:31,752
the essence of that, which has fragrance.

401
00:31:32,386 --> 00:31:36,534
You can also get some honey out of that.

402
00:31:36,764 --> 00:31:40,659
Whatever is possible, everybody comes to that flower.

403
00:31:41,558 --> 00:31:45,035
That doesn’t mean that flower in any way is weak,

404
00:31:45,207 --> 00:31:49,318
but that’s its quality, that’s its strength,
that’s its understanding.

405
00:31:52,499 --> 00:31:56,336
That’s what you are. You are all made into lotuses.

406
00:31:57,289 --> 00:32:00,295
You are not made into some sort of creeps

407
00:32:00,454 --> 00:32:05,365
or some sort of stupid donkeys, no!

408
00:32:06,718 --> 00:32:12,048
You are the people who are to give fragrance of your love,

409
00:32:12,308 --> 00:32:15,798
fragrance of your compassion to others.

410
00:32:15,993 --> 00:32:17,954
And you should feel happy about it.

411
00:32:18,726 --> 00:32:20,839
That doesn’t mean that you give up this,

412
00:32:20,947 --> 00:32:22,736
give up that. Nothing of the kind.

413
00:32:23,154 --> 00:32:25,447
But it means that, whatever you have,

414
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,036
whatever is your possibility, capability,

415
00:32:28,209 --> 00:32:32,413
you must try to do for others, give it to them.

416
00:32:33,522 --> 00:32:36,276
And the more you do in this collectivity…

417
00:32:36,493 --> 00:32:40,402
That’s what is very important, at least for America,

418
00:32:40,611 --> 00:32:43,799
because everybody is trying to follow America,

419
00:32:44,872 --> 00:32:47,952
money-making business, this business, that thing.

420
00:32:49,752 --> 00:32:51,590
But you are all Sahaja Yogis,

421
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:54,764
so what you have to do is take

422
00:32:55,997 --> 00:33:01,369
advantage of your achievement and give this to others,

423
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:05,848
give Realisation to others. Many people who get Realisation

424
00:33:06,121 --> 00:33:08,329
don’t even bother about it.

425
00:33:09,165 --> 00:33:11,876
They just don’t go and spread Sahaja Yoga.

426
00:33:12,417 --> 00:33:14,378
They are not bothered about it.

427
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:17,112
Which is sometimes very shocking to Me,

428
00:33:17,349 --> 00:33:19,274
because what was the need for Me

429
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:23,286
to go around the whole world with all the mad people living,

430
00:33:23,473 --> 00:33:25,823
and talking to them about Sahaja Yoga?

431
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:29,385
In the same way, you should also feel now

432
00:33:29,602 --> 00:33:32,351
that:  “We have to do this work, we have to change the world.

433
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:34,643
We have to get them into Sahaja Yoga.”

434
00:33:34,788 --> 00:33:36,972
Why can’t we? We are so many people.

435
00:33:37,117 --> 00:33:39,172
Christ had only twelve disciples,

436
00:33:39,316 --> 00:33:41,690
and how much they spread Christianity!

437
00:33:42,677 --> 00:33:46,693
What about you people? You are so well equipped,

438
00:33:46,866 --> 00:33:48,943
you have so much of knowledge,

439
00:33:49,206 --> 00:33:53,451
absolute knowledge and experience.

440
00:33:54,093 --> 00:33:56,934
So if you have the experience and the knowledge,

441
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,480
you can capture the people.

442
00:34:00,128 --> 00:34:03,605
But there is some sort of a lurking ambition,

443
00:34:05,321 --> 00:34:09,432
which goes against, against the culture of Sahaja Yoga.

444
00:34:10,109 --> 00:34:11,774
You want to be leader,

445
00:34:11,861 --> 00:34:13,665
or you want to put down somebody,

446
00:34:13,788 --> 00:34:16,607
or you think no end of yourself. That’s no good.

447
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:20,090
And also they do Sahaja Yoga or spread Sahaja Yoga

448
00:34:20,198 --> 00:34:22,132
because they want to enhance themselves.

449
00:34:25,173 --> 00:34:29,625
This is not the way. The way is a complete surrendering,

450
00:34:30,299 --> 00:34:34,005
complete surrender to the work of Sahaja Yoga.

451
00:34:34,848 --> 00:34:38,584
It’s possible, it’s not difficult at all, as I’m telling you.

452
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,559
It’s very, very simple.

453
00:34:40,732 --> 00:34:42,979
Only thing, you should understand

454
00:34:43,102 --> 00:34:48,022
that you have a special place in the whole universe today.

455
00:34:50,025 --> 00:34:52,088
You are not to rot.

456
00:34:52,787 --> 00:34:55,117
You are not to waste your life.

457
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:59,003
We have started marriages,

458
00:34:59,256 --> 00:35:02,336
and in America also they said.
I said: “Alright, we’ll have marriages.”

459
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:05,769
But these marriages, what is the outcome?

460
00:35:06,013 --> 00:35:09,173
If they are like all other ordinary marriages, what’s the use?

461
00:35:09,748 --> 00:35:12,257
What are they doing for others?

462
00:35:12,511 --> 00:35:14,897
What sort of children they are producing?

463
00:35:15,187 --> 00:35:17,003
You have to see to it

464
00:35:17,251 --> 00:35:21,713
that you become married couples in Sahaja Yoga.

465
00:35:22,131 --> 00:35:26,012
Your family should be a different type,

466
00:35:26,631 --> 00:35:29,668
your love for your family should be of a different type.

467
00:35:30,373 --> 00:35:33,648
The whole family of Sahaja Yoga also needs your family.

468
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:38,037
So, for everyone, you must have compassion and love.

469
00:35:39,031 --> 00:35:41,188
I know some people grow very fast,

470
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:44,375
but some don’t, because they lack this

471
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:48,033
balance between emotion and intelligence.

472
00:35:48,508 --> 00:35:52,395
This balance has to be completely established.

473
00:35:52,611 --> 00:35:57,429
And I know, one day, this America will lead so many people,

474
00:35:57,695 --> 00:36:02,758
so many people, thousands, in Sahaja Yoga.

475
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:06,522
So far, whatever was wrong was adopted:

476
00:36:07,021 --> 00:36:10,583
drug addiction starts, then another thing starts.

477
00:36:10,828 --> 00:36:16,077
All kinds of nonsensical things started in this country.
Why?

478
00:36:18,394 --> 00:36:22,489
Now, the new lotuses that are there,

479
00:36:22,792 --> 00:36:26,007
they have to change the atmosphere of this lake,

480
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:29,319
where all kinds of dirty things are coming up,

481
00:36:29,694 --> 00:36:33,415
immoral things are coming up, ruining the whole world.

482
00:36:34,063 --> 00:36:36,789
So, in our general attitude also,

483
00:36:37,943 --> 00:36:41,672
we should try to see: “Are we really following?

484
00:36:42,176 --> 00:36:44,736
Are we really doing what is to be done?

485
00:36:44,945 --> 00:36:47,340
What are we doing for morality?”

486
00:36:48,147 --> 00:36:51,342
That’s a very important point in Sahaja Yoga,

487
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:55,489
how you dress, how you walk, how you talk,

488
00:36:55,771 --> 00:36:57,861
everything’s very important,

489
00:36:58,381 --> 00:37:01,835
and all other things that you have, you should try.

490
00:37:02,341 --> 00:37:08,153
How to create, and all these things of different, different Chakras,

491
00:37:08,578 --> 00:37:10,979
you should try to concentrate on them

492
00:37:11,152 --> 00:37:13,532
and see for yourself what are you doing?

493
00:37:15,162 --> 00:37:17,736
What are you making out of your life?

494
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:21,083
You are Sahaja Yogis. You are special people.

495
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:24,148
You are not ordinary. I want to tell you

496
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:27,746
that you should have self-esteem. Try to understand

497
00:37:28,864 --> 00:37:31,475
what is your quality, what are you.

498
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:35,701
Thank you very much.
May God bless you!
