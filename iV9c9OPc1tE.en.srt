1
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:27,240
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:39,080
At the very outset you have to know that truth is what it is.

3
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,080
We cannot change it.

4
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,360
We cannot transform it

5
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,760
and we cannot conceptualize it.

6
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:56,240
Also unfortunately at this human awareness

7
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,040
we cannot feel the truth,

8
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,680
so something has to be done,

9
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,960
something has to work out in our human awareness

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,120
in the evolutionary process.

11
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,680
We have become human beings from amoeba.

12
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,560
How did we become?

13
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,120
And if we are human beings

14
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,440
have we reached the Absolute State? We have not.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,640
If we had reached the absolute state

16
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,320
then there would have been no problems

17
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,560
because everybody would have seen the same thing,

18
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,640
would have understood the same thing

19
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,360
and felt the same thing

20
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,280
but because we are living in a relative world

21
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,000
we have all these problems.

22
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:08,480
As it is, most of the problems are created

23
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,360
by human beings.

24
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,840
If you see ecological problems,

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,640
if you see economic problems, political problems,

26
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,560
physical problems,

27
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,240
mental problems, family problems,

28
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,880
all of them are related to human beings.

29
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:40,960
So we have gone wrong somewhere,

30
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,320
there’s something that’s a missing point

31
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,200
which we have not realized.

32
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,880
The advancements we have made in our civilization,

33
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,800
say in science,

34
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,480
has reached such a stage that we had to create atom bomb,

35
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,560
hydrogen bomb.

36
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,200
So all these mental efforts we have put in also boomerang on us

37
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,080
and create our destruction.

38
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,960
In every way we get frustrated,

39
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,680
and we start seeking what’s the matter?

40
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,840
Then we turn to religion

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,240
and we find in religion also

42
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,200
it just words, words and words.

43
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,040
Whatever is written in the Bible,

44
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,840
same about written in Koran if you read it, or Dhammapada

45
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,160
or Gita everywhere is about just the same,

46
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,320
there’s not much of a change.

47
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,960
But still we may follow any religion,

48
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,160
so-called following I would say.

49
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:57,480
Still a human being belonging to any religion can commit any sin,

50
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,360
any sin.

51
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,440
There’s no binding force on him of that religion.

52
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,680
Why is it all these great religions,

53
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,240
which were created by great incarnations

54
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,680
and great prophets

55
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,760
have taken such a deviated path,

56
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,320
and why we have not been able to achieve

57
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,080
whatever they have promised to us?

58
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,880
What is the reason why we could not achieve that?

59
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,360
What has gone wrong?

60
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,080
If you read Koran you will be amazed,

61
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,720
the description of what was the vision of Mohammad Sahib

62
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,040
is far away from the Muslims as they are.

63
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,600
Same about Christians you can say.

64
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:02,040
When Christ has said “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.”

65
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,360
Difficult to find Christians who don’t have.

66
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,400
In this way we have to realize on one side

67
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,840
whatever mental efforts we are putting,

68
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,080
or on the other side whatever

69
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,360
physical or emotional efforts we are putting,

70
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,480
have come back to us,

71
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,480
destroying us.

72
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,880
We can see the result very clearly

73
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,400
why all these problems are there.

74
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,960
Still we adhere to something which is not reality.

75
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,320
We go on clinging to it

76
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,320
because perhaps we are born like that.

77
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,680
Perhaps we think that that’s we have done now all our lives

78
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,440
so why give up.

79
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,480
And the forefathers have done the same,

80
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,440
you are doing the same.

81
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,080
But now a new category of very honest people are there

82
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,560
in this world who are seeking beyond.

83
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,480
William Blake has called them men of God,

84
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,680
those who will seek the truth

85
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,600
and they will make other people also godly.

86
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,440
That’s the time has come, this resurrection time has come we should say

87
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,040
or this is the Last Judgment.

88
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,160
This Last Judgment is going to be done

89
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,520
by this Kundalini, the power within you.

90
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,960
This is your own power

91
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,520
which has to be awakened

92
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,040
and once it is awakened it passes through these centers as told to you

93
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,760
and lets you know that these are your problems.

94
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,800
These are the problems of your chakras.

95
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,480
They may be physical, may be emotional,

96
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:05,560
they may be, could be also spiritual.

97
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,440
And once you know these problems

98
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,720
and if you know how to solve these problems

99
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:18,480
you can be a very normal, sensible, balanced personality.

100
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,960
That’s not the only thing that happens

101
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,520
when you get your self realization.

102
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,400
Firstly what happens to you is that

103
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,960
when the Kundalini passes through your Agyna chakra

104
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,320
then you become thoughtlessly aware.

105
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:44,160
If you see all the sciences they have created about religion,

106
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:49,080
talks and the whole thing, it’s just mental.

107
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,960
It’s not inside, it’s not innate, built within.

108
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,000
So one thought rises, another thought falls.

109
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,160
Another thought rises and falls down,

110
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,040
some come from the future, some come from the past,

111
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,800
and we are jumping on the cusp of these thoughts.

112
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,720
But if you say now, this is the present,

113
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,840
stop your mind at the stop point

114
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,640
which is the present, you can’t,

115
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,760
you just can’t do it.

116
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,960
Between these thoughts there is a gap.

117
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,520
This gap is the present, but it’s so small, it’s so small

118
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,120
that you cannot find it.

119
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,680
But when the Kundalini passes through,

120
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,920
then this center, then these two institutions as you see them,

121
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,880
the conditioning and the ego are just sucked in.

122
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,720
As a result you become thoughtlessly aware.

123
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,560
Means there is no thought.

124
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,680
But you are absolutely aware, very much more aware.

125
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,040
For example if you look at this beautiful hall

126
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,960
with the thoughtless awareness,

127
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,520
then the whole picture becomes clear

128
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,160
like a photo in your mind,

129
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:18,040
whole thing is stored up into every detail so clearly

130
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,560
because present is the truth,

131
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,240
past is finished and future doesn’t exist.

132
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,520
So to come to the present you have to have

133
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,800
this new awareness called as thoughtless awareness.

134
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,440
But when She crosses over

135
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,400
and pierces through your fontanel bone area

136
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:43,040
which is the actualization of your baptism.

137
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,960
Just people talk of baptism, “Come along I’ll baptize you”.

138
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,560
It’s not possible that way.

139
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,080
It’s just an artificial ritual.

140
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,080
Try to understand, this is not going to render

141
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,640
that actual happening within you

142
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,640
which is going to make you grow spiritually.

143
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,320
So the actualization of baptism takes place

144
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,120
and you can feel also from your fontanel bone area

145
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:12,520
a kind of a cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming in.

146
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,200
You feel extremely relaxed.

147
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,560
Secondly that you jump into another higher awareness

148
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,480
which we call, as collective consciousness.

149
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,440
This means that

150
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,200
not only that you can you feel your own centers on your fingertips,

151
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,280
because these cool vibrations you can call

152
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,840
them start flowing through your own hands,

153
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,200
you can feel them.

154
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,240
But also you get information about others

155
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,360
as well as about yourself on these fingertips.

156
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:57,920
Automatically you become like a person who is a computer.

157
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,800
It starts working in such a wonderful manner

158
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,200
that you can find out about any disease,

159
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,720
any trouble without going through all the diagnosis or anything,

160
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,640
and if you know how to cure these troubles, physically, mentally,

161
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,680
you can definitely cure yourself and also others

162
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,520
if you have reached that state

163
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,400
and have permanently achieved it.

164
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,240
This is what has to happen to us.

165
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,680
All of us have to achieve that state

166
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,120
which is your right to achieve it.

167
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,880
Sahaja means with you is born.

168
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,160
This yoga means the union.

169
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:47,400
The union with this All Pervading Power of God’s love.

170
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,360
It exists or not, we have never bothered to find out.

171
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,280
We see these beautiful flowers,

172
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,320
very beautiful flowers and everything around.

173
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,840
When I came from Sydney I saw the beauty,

174
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,480
the nature had just spread for the pleasure of human beings,

175
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,960
we never even think how it has happened,

176
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,560
what has worked it out, all these living things.

177
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,880
We don’t even think how this eye of ours

178
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:21,080
is such a beautiful camera, how it has been made,

179
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,080
how is it this brain which is such a great computer,

180
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,840
how is it made. Who has made it?

181
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,360
They may say it is autonomous but who is this auto?

182
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,040
We have never tried to find out.

183
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,480
That there is this All Pervading Power of God’s love

184
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,840
which has done all this living work

185
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and now for us it is to feel that,

186
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,840
that is the yoga is, the union with that Divine.

187
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,520
It’s not physical, it’s not mental,

188
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,800
but it is spiritual where

189
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,280
you start first time feeling this All Pervading Power.

190
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,320
Then only you have to know how to use this power

191
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,200
which flows through you.

192
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,920
But it moves very slowly and people,

193
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,280
you see this is not a plastic work

194
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,200
that you can go on producing many

195
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,640
and we don’t have any organization as such,

196
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,680
we do not organize people

197
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,360
and we do not take any money at all, you cannot.

198
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,520
How much can you pay for this Divine Work?

199
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,720
How much do we pay to Mother Earth for what she gives us

200
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,800
all these beautiful flowers?

201
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,280
She doesn’t understand money, so you cannot pay for it.

202
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,440
But there are many, many organizations afloat,

203
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,080
which are taking money, which are giving you mental heat

204
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,720
and people run after them,

205
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,280
they like to go on working out that yarn

206
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,080
that they have spun for you.

207
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,000
One has to go beyond this mind to feel the spirituality.

208
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,760
With this mind, that is human mind, you cannot understand it,

209
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,960
you have to have Divine mind.

210
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,080
But once you get your realization

211
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,680
your mind also gets enlightened,

212
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,160
and when your mind is enlightened, you can perceive,

213
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,960
penetrate into every situation

214
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:20,440
in such a deeper manner and the way you can improve it.

215
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,800
I can tell you a simple analogy to understand.

216
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:31,760
Supposing you are standing in the sea and the sea is rough,

217
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,040
you are afraid of the waves, very much afraid.

218
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,680
But supposing somebody puts you on the boat,

219
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,800
and then you can see those waves and enjoy them.

220
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,280
But supposing you learn how to swim

221
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,080
then you can jump in and save them.

222
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,360
It is not any brainwashing

223
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,840
or any sort of a bombardment of words,

224
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,760
but it is something that happens to you.

225
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,360
You become something as you have become human beings,

226
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,640
you become realized souls

227
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:09,640
as a result of this last breakthrough of your evolution.

228
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,560
This is happening everywhere no doubt

229
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,440
and it’s working out very well in,

230
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,840
I think they told me, 62 countries

231
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,280
but at least I know of definitely of 52 countries

232
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,880
where there We have got very strong centers

233
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,760
where it is working out.

234
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,920
Now whatever we are telling you here

235
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,400
you need not accept blindfolded.

236
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,400
Blind faith is of no use.

237
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,680
First of all you must experience.

238
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,400
Just like a hypothesis I am putting this before you,

239
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,680
but you should have an open mind of a scientist.

240
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,400
Just open your mind and see for yourself it works.

241
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,280
If it works then you have to accept.

242
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,480
If you are honest you have to accept.

243
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,240
If it doesn’t work. If it works with many,

244
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,760
why not try and work it out.

245
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,080
Most of the people do get their realization. I have seen it.

246
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,040
It’s a wonderful thing that is happening

247
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,200
that masses of people can get realization.

248
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,480
Depends on also certain places like Russia I was amazed.

249
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,360
Where they have not heard the name of God

250
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,920
they have never heard the name of Christ.

251
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,960
They were not allowed to read Bible or any book,

252
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,800
they had no religion at all.

253
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,680
They believed in no religion.

254
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:27,320
Where thousands and thousands come to My program

255
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,200
and they all get their realization.

256
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,840
In a small place called Togliati

257
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,640
there are 22 thousand Sahaja Yogis practicing Sahaja Yoga.

258
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,560
Can you imagine it? I was so amazed.

259
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,000
Same about Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland.

260
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,320
I was amazed how these people, Czechoslovakia,

261
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,160
how they have taken to Sahaja Yoga so fast,

262
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,680
just like fish to water,

263
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,400
how they realized it, and nobody else,

264
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,320
all these false people, could not go there,

265
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,160
nothing could work out.

266
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,600
Only thing that has really worked out there

267
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,200
is something that is genuine. That is Sahaja Yoga.

268
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:15,360
One has to realize that as we are not in the Absolute State,

269
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,080
we have to reach to the Absolute State.

270
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,440
That desire should be there.

271
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,840
If that desire is there it works out

272
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,840
without any difficulty.

273
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,320
It is your own power which manifests

274
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,400
and gradually you can manifest them in such a way

275
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:36,480
that you can do so many things like giving realization to others,

276
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:43,200
curing others and also enjoying it,

277
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:49,320
because when the attention is filled with the light of the Spirit,

278
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,600
it fills you up with complete joy,

279
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,600
and joy has not two sides like happiness and unhappiness.

280
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:04,200
It’s singular, it’s absolute and you are then,

281
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:11,760
they say they are swimming in the ocean of joy.

282
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,600
So beautiful it is.

283
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:21,280
This new race, we can call it.

284
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,720
The new society, is already formed.

285
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,640
It’s there, they’re angel-like people, beautiful.

286
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,720
I never tell them, don’t drink, don’t smoke,

287
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,200
don’t take drugs, nothing of the kind. I don’t tell them,

288
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,760
it just automatically drops out

289
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,840
because in the light they see the ignorance that they had.

290
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,440
They see the darkness and they just drop it.

291
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,280
We don’t have to tell them anything,

292
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,920
not to brainwash them or anything; it just works automatically.

293
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,520
You don’t have to follow any kind

294
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,760
of a fundamental groups or things, nothing of the kind.

295
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,880
You just know this is fundamental because you have got

296
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,880
the light within you, then they see the goodness,

297
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,440
then they see the oneness of all the religions.

298
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,040
So if you know the oneness of all the religions,

299
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,120
why will you be fundamentalist?

300
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,320
If you belong to one organization or to another church

301
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,200
or to another religion then you fight.

302
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,800
When you get into compartments like this, then only you fight.

303
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,760
Everybody thinks we are the chosen ones,

304
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,240
that’s how we have this fundamentalism now,

305
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,200
knocking at our doors. So to get rid of it

306
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,200
the best thing is. First of all

307
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,680
you have to become a universal being,

308
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,720
and this Spirit is the Universal Being.

309
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,680
Once you become the Universal Being

310
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,720
then you will be surprised to see it,

311
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,120
that all these differences you saw because of complete ignorance.

312
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,760
For example there is light you can see each other here,

313
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,560
but supposing there is complete pitch darkness,

314
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,360
you don’t know who’s sitting here, who is right, who is left..

315
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,680
You don’t know how to walk.

316
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,960
You may trample over people, you may just get frightened,

317
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,480
you may run helter skelter.

318
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,520
But if there is light you see things so clearly.

319
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,680
In the same way Sahaja Yoga works first.

320
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,760
Some people get not all the light I should say,

321
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,440
but they do get a little light, a glimmer of light,

322
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,960
and then it starts expanding. And when it expands

323
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,880
you will be amazed how things work out.

324
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,960
Also I have seen people after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

325
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,640
they become extremely intelligent, absorbent,

326
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,160
and a kind of a very dynamic personality comes in them.

327
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,560
Now you have seen these Australians singing Sanskrit songs.

328
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,840
I mean imagine, Sanskrit,

329
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,920
even these English lived in India for 300 years,

330
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,640
they couldn’t learn one sentence of Hindi language,

331
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,960
leave alone Sanskrit, but the way they are singing with such

332
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,840
clarity, even the Indians are surprised

333
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,280
at how they are singing our songs in Sanskrit language.

334
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,880
It is an impossibility,

335
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,520
you cannot think of a Western person singing like this

336
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,920
with all the rhythm and the melody and all that

337
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,520
and in no time they pick it up.

338
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,960
There are artists and artists who have now got world fame in India

339
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,440
after coming to Sahaja Yoga. We have got here also

340
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,480
some artists who were painters and have become very,

341
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,600
have got a good name for themselves. Everything changes.

342
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,440
You become on top of the world but you don’t become competitive,

343
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,800
you start enjoying each other.

344
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,840
Such a brotherhood, such love, such friendship,

345
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,120
that you become one drop becoming an ocean,

346
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,240
microcosm becoming the macrocosm.

347
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,440
We talk about these things but we have never achieved it.

348
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,080
Now the time has come for us to achieve all this.

349
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,280
In this one lecture I know I can’t talk much.

350
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,800
Last year also I was here

351
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,280
and Lord Mayor was here also to grace the occasion.

352
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,240
I found him to be a remarkable person,

353
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,800
the way he got his realization.

354
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,120
You are especially blessed people I think,

355
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,000
Newcastle with this beautiful lake here

356
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:21,480
and beautiful surroundings, and I hope that

357
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,080
