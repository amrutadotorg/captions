00:02.111 --> 00:08.089
Today is the sixth day of Navaratri.

00:19.546 --> 00:24.039
There have been many incarnations
of the Goddess

00:24.064 --> 00:28.384
for different, different purposes.

00:32.635 --> 00:41.505
But when the great saints
introspect themselves,

00:41.530 --> 00:45.046
who were worshipping the Mother,

00:45.079 --> 00:55.469
they found out that what
She has done for us.

00:56.631 --> 01:00.071
The other day I told you
the dharma

01:00.096 --> 01:07.641
is the innate valency of human beings.
And they are ten.

01:07.666 --> 01:14.520
This is already established within us,
but we deviate,

01:14.545 --> 01:19.544
deviate from dharma and all
the problems come in,

01:19.569 --> 01:26.880
because to leave the dharma
is not a human quality.

01:28.496 --> 01:35.921
But Goddess Herself has done so many
things for us already, within us,

01:35.946 --> 01:39.670
though we are not aware of it.

01:40.279 --> 01:45.563
It is said that “ya Devi sarva
bhuteshu” -

01:45.588 --> 01:50.746
"all those whom You have created",
- means mostly the human beings -

01:50.771 --> 01:58.194
"What do You do? As what do You exist
inside the human beings? ”.

02:00.593 --> 02:07.083
Now, just introspect if you have
these qualities within you or not,

02:07.124 --> 02:16.647
because they are given to you by
the Goddess, by the Shakti within you.

02:19.377 --> 02:26.933
Like: ”Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
shanti rupena samstitha”.

02:26.958 --> 02:34.747
is very important, that You exist
within the human beings as peace.

02:34.772 --> 02:41.585
Do you find thus human beings
who are peaceful within and without?

02:41.610 --> 02:46.456
Very difficult. But She has given
you that,

02:46.481 --> 02:51.233
She has given you that peace
which you have to achieve.

02:51.258 --> 02:58.528
Now it comes, because you have fallen
off your human dharmas.

02:58.553 --> 03:02.877
So this peace that She has given you,
you have to achieve

03:02.902 --> 03:08.833
through your ascent, through
the Kundalini awakening.

03:08.858 --> 03:18.901
You are excited, all right.
Or, you want to take revenge,

03:18.926 --> 03:26.050
you want to hurt others,
you want to trouble others;

03:26.075 --> 03:30.327
you enjoy sometimes,
even as sahaja yogis

03:30.352 --> 03:36.994
people enjoy hurting others,
troubling others.

03:37.019 --> 03:41.004
So, the second one She says is:

03:41.029 --> 03:48.016
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
pritti rupena samsthita”.

03:48.041 --> 03:52.430
Pritti  is the quality of loving,

03:52.455 --> 04:00.300
that a human being has been given
the quality of loving.

04:00.325 --> 04:03.530
But, it’s not there.

04:03.555 --> 04:10.586
Because first nonsensical thing
human beings have is jealousy.

04:12.594 --> 04:17.357
Now, supposing I give some present
to somebody,

04:17.382 --> 04:20.008
and some present to another one.

04:20.033 --> 04:25.720
Even in Sahaja Yoga they feel
jealous. Very surprising.

04:25.745 --> 04:31.605
How can you, when the Goddess
has given you the quality to love?

04:31.630 --> 04:40.447
Very, very common nonsense about it
is that human beings are very jealous.

04:40.472 --> 04:44.207
But as sahaja yogis you should
not do,

04:44.232 --> 04:49.541
because that quality that the Goddess
has given you is of loving.

04:49.566 --> 04:53.524
That quality should be shown -
on the contrary you are very jealous.

04:53.549 --> 04:59.101
That means you are not a sahaja yogi,
blessed by Shri Mataji - no.

04:59.126 --> 05:03.762
If you are blessed, then you will have
no jealousy whatsoever.

05:03.787 --> 05:08.811
And this jealousy sometimes it goes
to this extent that

05:08.836 --> 05:18.110
"Now, we are, say, from Cabella,
so you are from Albera. Finished!"

05:18.135 --> 05:22.692
These so close to each other.

05:22.717 --> 05:30.443
Just like the two nostrils together.
But there will be jealousy.

05:30.468 --> 05:34.913
There will be jealousy about,
”Why not Mother come to my country,

05:34.938 --> 05:38.782
if You can go to that country”.

05:38.807 --> 05:42.102
So this comes also from the ignorance
that

05:42.127 --> 05:48.032
“This is mine, this is mine,
this is yours”.

05:48.897 --> 05:58.194
This jealousy starts in such a funny
manner that we do not realize also

05:58.219 --> 06:07.189
that She has given us the power to love.
Tremendous power to love.

06:08.995 --> 06:13.349
Inauspicious power, our cannot be.

06:13.374 --> 06:18.869
But auspicious, dharmic power
to love somebody.

06:18.894 --> 06:26.449
Means without any lust and greed,
without any jealousy.

06:26.474 --> 06:30.978
But the human mind has developed
itself so cunning

06:31.003 --> 06:36.155
that it is proud that it can be
jealous of someone.

06:36.180 --> 06:41.498
Out of this jealousy only greed
comes in, as I told you.

06:41.523 --> 06:47.249
Is a fact, because you feel jealous
- so you want to buy the same thing.

06:47.274 --> 06:50.416
Then you must compete with others.

06:50.441 --> 06:56.887
If somebody has got a job better than
yours, then you must compete with him.

06:58.641 --> 07:05.091
These things are all destructive and
the powers of Goddess are constructive.

07:05.116 --> 07:13.545
She gives you all the powers
that are absolutely constructive.

07:13.570 --> 07:19.371
Then She says, “Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu”,
the saints have said it,

07:19.396 --> 07:22.878
- "kshama rupena samsthita”.

07:22.903 --> 07:29.437
Kshama is what you call
is the forgiveness.

07:29.462 --> 07:33.293
Forgiveness from the heart.

07:33.318 --> 07:38.657
All right, somebody has been cruel
to you, has been nasty to you,

07:38.682 --> 07:41.639
has exploited you, has troubled you,

07:41.664 --> 07:47.516
but you have the power, greater power
to forgive.

07:47.541 --> 07:53.169
Do we use that power to forgive?

07:57.037 --> 08:04.601
Then for relaxing also, what does
She do, that She gives you the sleep.

08:04.626 --> 08:09.817
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
nidra rupena samsthita”.

08:09.842 --> 08:14.817
When you are tired and you
can’t sleep

08:14.842 --> 08:21.259
She makes you sleep. She relaxes you.
So the power of relaxation She does

08:21.284 --> 08:25.469
because She acts through parasympathetic
nervous system.

08:25.494 --> 08:30.344
The sympathetic nervous system
can excite you, can depress you.

08:30.369 --> 08:36.290
But the parasympathetic relaxes you,
relaxes your heart,

08:36.315 --> 08:40.337
relaxes your body and completely
feel relaxed

08:40.362 --> 08:44.363
and sleeping in the lap of your Mother.

08:44.388 --> 08:48.841
But there are many people
who cannot sleep.

08:49.507 --> 08:56.854
Because they are thinking about
something they have to achieve.

08:56.879 --> 09:02.131
If you cannot sleep, then something
wrong with you.

09:02.156 --> 09:06.235
And when you cannot sleep
I also cannot sleep.

09:06.260 --> 09:13.189
Whatever collectively happening
also works on Me.

09:13.214 --> 09:19.868
Anything wrong you do, that works
on Me, specially collectively.

09:19.892 --> 09:27.581
So you cannot sleep because you are
thinking of things which are of no value.

09:27.606 --> 09:29.971
Now, to overcome that in Sahaja Yoga

09:29.996 --> 09:33.452
we know we have to go into
thoughtless awareness.

09:33.477 --> 09:37.753
But when your ego is working or...

09:37.778 --> 09:42.317
This child is very disturbing. I've seen
him all the time running about.

09:42.342 --> 09:47.606
Better tell him. Whose son is he?

09:51.764 --> 09:56.850
You see, in India you’ll find children
absolutely keeping quiet.

09:56.875 --> 10:04.628
Why? Because the mother takes up
the responsibility to train the child.

10:04.653 --> 10:08.403
So many programs you have had,
have you ever seen

10:08.428 --> 10:12.116
any child running about? Yesterday also
they were running about here.

10:12.141 --> 10:17.958
The reason is mother doesn’t take
responsibility as a mother

10:17.983 --> 10:22.459
to see that the children are properly
brought up.

10:22.484 --> 10:26.759
Even you are so old, but I have
to tell you.

10:26.784 --> 10:32.628
Whatever is good for you, for your
society, a new generation that has come.

10:32.653 --> 10:38.522
In this new generation if you still
are not behaving in a proper way,

10:38.547 --> 10:42.645
in abnormal way, how can you
impress others?

10:42.670 --> 10:46.217
So, Mother has to tell you.

10:51.404 --> 11:00.326
The most interesting thing that
the Mother has put in you is

11:00.351 --> 11:06.714
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
bhranti rupena samsthita”.

11:06.739 --> 11:10.534
She puts you into delusion,

11:10.559 --> 11:15.276
because sometimes the children
cannot understand

11:15.301 --> 11:21.657
unless and until they face the delusion.
They have to face the delusion.

11:21.682 --> 11:27.285
She allows, allows you to go wrong

11:27.310 --> 11:32.006
to a point where you discover
you are lost.

11:32.031 --> 11:35.267
Very important it is that She plays,

11:35.292 --> 11:39.019
this is the Mahamaya part
as they say.

11:39.044 --> 11:43.210
And this is discussed
in every religion

11:43.235 --> 11:48.079
that we get lost with this delusion.

11:48.104 --> 11:52.683
Now, what are the delusions
we have?

11:52.708 --> 11:56.613
We have the delusions
of ego.

11:56.638 --> 12:01.891
Ego for men as if they are
very powerful,

12:01.916 --> 12:08.466
that they can do what they like and they
are not going to be punished for it.

12:08.491 --> 12:12.881
For women they too behave
in the same manner.

12:12.906 --> 12:17.747
They don’t understand that
this is a delusion

12:17.772 --> 12:26.265
the Mother has given into us for us
to find out that we are in the wrong.

12:26.290 --> 12:31.412
Because if you tell somebody,
“This is wrong, you don’t do it”,

12:31.437 --> 12:36.498
still they are not matured enough
so they’ll go on doing wrong things.

12:36.523 --> 12:41.762
So the Mother says, “All right, go on.
Very nice, very good. Very good thing.

12:41.787 --> 12:46.154
You’ll jump in the sea? – Jump”.

12:46.644 --> 12:53.229
Then when you realize that you
have been in a delusion,

12:53.254 --> 12:56.317
then only you can return back.

12:56.342 --> 13:00.651
Otherwise without any problem
you cannot return.

13:00.676 --> 13:11.935
So many of you are so obstinate,
so self-conscious.

13:11.960 --> 13:16.700
Whatever one may tell you,
you will not listen.

13:16.725 --> 13:23.286
Whatever way you may try to convince,
on a mental level, you won’t.

13:23.311 --> 13:29.321
So, the bhranti, the delusion,
is beyond the mind.

13:29.346 --> 13:32.644
It is beyond the mind.

13:32.669 --> 13:39.677
It works out sometimes very well
for difficult people.

13:40.053 --> 13:47.329
Now, when you are in a position
of a Mother

13:47.354 --> 13:54.283
you don’t want Your child to be ruined, naturally.

13:54.308 --> 13:58.756
She feels responsible,
and She thinks that:

13:58.781 --> 14:02.814
“Now they have got connection
with the Divine,

14:02.839 --> 14:06.283
and this connection should not
be broken,

14:06.308 --> 14:11.396
that they should be all the time
blessed and be happy.

14:11.421 --> 14:15.072
All this is within us,

14:15.710 --> 14:21.418
within us, built-in, from our
very childhood,

14:21.443 --> 14:28.304
but we forget, slowly, slowly
we start losing it.

14:28.329 --> 14:33.397
Maybe the conditioning is such
or maybe the ego is such,

14:33.422 --> 14:41.130
and maybe that they forget that
they are realized souls.

14:41.155 --> 14:47.050
I’m talking to you - to people who are
realized souls. I’m not talking

14:47.075 --> 14:53.738
to people who are already lost or who
may be on their way to Sahaja Yoga.

14:53.763 --> 14:58.200
But the way you are brought up,
the way you have been told

14:58.225 --> 15:05.958
very sweetly with love, with affection,
with kindness,

15:05.983 --> 15:11.483
and if you don’t understand that,
then you go into bhranti.

15:11.508 --> 15:13.617
For example, it is also said that,

15:13.642 --> 15:20.554
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
lajja rupena samsthita”.

15:21.371 --> 15:26.990
Lajja, I don’t know how to describe,
it’s not shyness.

15:27.015 --> 15:36.066
It is a kind of a shame about
your body.

15:37.330 --> 15:44.030
Now they have beauty contests. India
also they had beauty contest.

15:44.055 --> 15:48.633
Why are you writing?
What is he writing?

15:48.658 --> 15:53.825
There’s no need to write, there will be
a tape. Alright?

15:54.876 --> 15:58.042
Lajja rupena samsthita:

15:58.067 --> 16:04.234
means you have to have shame
of your body.

16:05.123 --> 16:08.901
That’s specially for women.

16:08.926 --> 16:17.557
As a child you will see, women are
very shy.

16:17.582 --> 16:20.638
See, little girls, they are
very shy.

16:20.663 --> 16:23.601
That shyness gradually disappears,

16:23.626 --> 16:27.101
but in the beginning they are
even shy of Me.

16:27.126 --> 16:31.561
They come before Me, they’ll put down
their head.

16:31.586 --> 16:36.712
They’ll not even say Namaste.
Very sweet.

16:37.321 --> 16:40.691
And they don’t like people wearing
funny dresses.

16:40.716 --> 16:45.930
I remember My granddaughter once,
she saw one magazine

16:45.955 --> 16:50.811
in which there was a lady in a swimming
dress. She said, “What are you doing?

16:50.836 --> 16:55.907
Better wear your dress, otherwise
my Grandma will come and hit you hard”.

16:55.932 --> 17:00.941
To that lady was saying that; and then
she opened and saw a man’s dress

17:00.966 --> 17:05.847
with just a small, little knicker.
I don’t know why they do it.

17:05.872 --> 17:09.947
And then she said, “This one is, seems
to be absolutely shameless fellow.

17:09.972 --> 17:13.281
He is going to have a bad time now.”
And she closed it.

17:13.306 --> 17:16.965
And then she told the maidservant,
“Burn this, burn this off.

17:16.990 --> 17:23.850
I don’t want to see.” Such a little
girl she knew that it was wrong.

17:23.875 --> 17:31.027
But the way nowadays we are going
about with the show of our body,

17:31.052 --> 17:39.757
and sometimes I feel that all these
designers will die

17:39.782 --> 17:47.177
or will get bankrupt, because people
wear such little clothes these days.

17:47.202 --> 17:51.994
There is no space for any artist

17:52.019 --> 18:01.646
to show his work or to show his art
how he can dress you up.

18:01.671 --> 18:08.711
In Japan I asked them how - this is long
time back, now Japanese are Americans

18:08.736 --> 18:12.920
but at that time - I said, “How is it
you wear these dresses, these kimonos,

18:12.945 --> 18:20.588
done so well, very expensive and
it takes time to wear that?”.

18:21.023 --> 18:26.236
So they said that, “You see, if God
has made a beautiful body,

18:26.261 --> 18:29.887
then it is His art,

18:29.912 --> 18:37.577
and we have to make our art
decorate it.

18:37.602 --> 18:42.554
So what we do is to make our art
to decorate it.”

18:42.579 --> 18:46.813
I really liked it, because in India
same thing.

18:46.838 --> 18:50.422
If there is a lady she has
to wear a sari,

18:50.447 --> 18:54.116
which is being made very artfully,
very beautifully,

18:54.141 --> 19:00.367
just to decorate her body,
just to respect the body.

19:00.883 --> 19:06.665
But this seems to have gone
with the influence of America,

19:06.690 --> 19:10.763
I should say, which are, they are
brainless people, absolutely brainless,

19:10.788 --> 19:15.980
nothing to learn from them.
Only two-hundred-year-old people

19:16.005 --> 19:19.672
and we start behaving in their
manner,

19:19.697 --> 19:22.723
we don’t see even what is happening
to their country,

19:22.748 --> 19:28.106
what sort of people they are,
how they live, what is their idea,

19:28.131 --> 19:32.701
what is their goal in life. Every false
guru has exploited them,

19:32.726 --> 19:36.853
because they are brainless.
If they had brains

19:36.878 --> 19:39.642
they would never have accepted
them.

19:39.667 --> 19:42.724
Ha, they have brains how to run
a computer

19:42.749 --> 19:46.094
and how to run a television -
mechanical things.

19:46.119 --> 19:51.687
But as far as their own body is concerned,
they don’t know how to manage.

19:51.712 --> 19:58.498
In India they had a beauty competition
and many sensible people opposed it,

19:58.523 --> 20:03.389
because it’s like selling your body
and making money.

20:03.414 --> 20:07.837
What is the difference between
prostitution and this?

20:07.862 --> 20:14.409
If you get money by selling your body,
then it’s prostitution.

20:14.434 --> 20:18.063
You are not supposed to sell
your body.

20:18.088 --> 20:23.205
That’s not what Goddess has done
to you.

20:23.230 --> 20:28.457
But you should dress up well, different,
different occasions are there,

20:28.482 --> 20:32.371
for those occasions you have to wear
the way it is.

20:32.396 --> 20:36.456
The other day I gave a very nice
sari which is,

20:36.481 --> 20:39.932
we call as paithani to one lady
as a present.

20:39.957 --> 20:47.998
And we had a function for a book,
was inaugurated,

20:48.023 --> 20:51.910
and this lady came there. So I said,
“Why didn’t you wear a paithani?”

20:51.935 --> 20:56.008
She said, “What, there is
no wedding on.

20:56.033 --> 21:02.563
How can I wear for this function
paithani? There has to be a wedding.”

21:02.589 --> 21:07.992
Very sweet – “in the wedding
I can wear.”

21:08.017 --> 21:15.712
It is all, you see occasions, places
which are to be celebrated.

21:15.737 --> 21:18.915
Like in India, when women go
to the temple

21:18.940 --> 21:22.519
or to worship the idols or anything,

21:22.544 --> 21:30.974
then they will wear all that is necessary
to face the Goddess, after all.

21:30.999 --> 21:36.684
Imagine people coming for this program
here wearing,

21:36.709 --> 21:43.920
I don’t know what they call it, but like
jute, jute clothes - like hippies,

21:43.945 --> 21:48.087
what would happen to Me? I would disappear
in thin air, I can tell you this much.

21:48.112 --> 21:51.122
So, one has to have respect
for the body.

21:51.147 --> 21:57.908
That is what She has said first -
that “Lajja rupena samsthita”.

21:57.933 --> 22:03.901
Now you might say that there are people
who are taking the bath in the river

22:03.926 --> 22:08.302
and this and that, and give
justification.

22:08.327 --> 22:12.885
But you are saints! You are
realized souls!

22:12.910 --> 22:16.110
You don’t have to see those people
who are not yet realized

22:16.135 --> 22:19.563
and who are misbehaving.

22:19.588 --> 22:25.397
You must do what a saint should do.

22:25.851 --> 22:30.048
There are so many qualities that
the Goddess has given you.

22:30.073 --> 22:34.934
Another is kshudha rupena
samstitha.

22:34.959 --> 22:41.365
She’s the One who has given us hunger.
We have to eat our food.

22:41.390 --> 22:45.482
Nowadays there’s a fashion of becoming
thin or whatever you may call.

22:45.507 --> 22:49.125
And you know so many diseases
have developed.

22:49.150 --> 22:54.445
Anorexia, this thing, that thing,
because women want to eat little.

22:54.470 --> 22:58.906
You can change the things
that you are eating,

22:58.931 --> 23:04.531
but it’s not the aim of life to only
look after your body.

23:04.556 --> 23:12.141
Body is not the only important thing.
What is important is your Spirit.

23:12.536 --> 23:17.262
And She is the One who gives you
the Kundalini.

23:17.287 --> 23:22.155
She is the One who give you a method
by which you’ll ascend.

23:22.180 --> 23:26.520
But all the time worried about
their body.

23:26.545 --> 23:33.196
This is something I can’t understand.
Specially the women who are the shakti.

23:33.221 --> 23:41.626
Then another point is that they
follow a fashion.

23:42.488 --> 23:46.563
Fashion is madness.

23:47.778 --> 23:54.105
When I was young I used to wear
My blouses like this only.

23:54.130 --> 23:56.833
But in India also fashion started.

23:56.858 --> 24:01.301
They used to increase the size
of the sleeves,

24:01.327 --> 24:07.932
then decreased the size of the sleeves,
then some went up to here.

24:07.957 --> 24:12.210
I thought, “What is this nonsense?
Why waste money like this?”.

24:12.235 --> 24:14.440
You have a particular design,

24:14.465 --> 24:18.447
and this is traditionally accepted
design, that you should have.

24:18.472 --> 24:22.144
Why do you want to go on increasing
and decreasing

24:22.169 --> 24:27.113
the size of your sleeves, according
to the fashion. “This is the fashion”.

24:27.138 --> 24:33.462
Who makes the fashion? Devi?
Devi has made the fashion?

24:33.487 --> 24:40.434
Who has made the fashion? Is these
hungry, greedy people

24:40.475 --> 24:45.459
who are befooling you. And you are
trying to follow fashions.

24:45.484 --> 24:49.973
Now, for example, I told that you must
put oil in your head,

24:49.998 --> 24:55.065
at least on Saturday put sufficient oil
and then wash your head.

24:55.090 --> 25:00.216
But you’ll not do that and then
you’ll start losing your hair.

25:00.241 --> 25:05.510
I can understand if you have no time,
you are a very busy man - but why?

25:05.535 --> 25:12.159
Why not do something where it is
needed to look after yourself also.

25:12.184 --> 25:15.831
So, you’ll look after your body
to thin down, you’ll lose your hair,

25:15.856 --> 25:18.689
eyesight will be weak, your teeth
will be falling,

25:18.737 --> 25:24.520
and you will become very soon
an old hag.

25:25.136 --> 25:31.150
Same with the men, nowadays men are
also going to beauty parlor, I’m told.

25:31.174 --> 25:34.531
Too much money I think, and stupidity
together.

25:34.556 --> 25:40.149
There is no need. If you lead
a good, healthy life

25:40.174 --> 25:44.030
- you have to exercise and meditate.

25:44.055 --> 25:48.603
If you meditate you become peaceful.

25:48.628 --> 25:54.107
With that peace, you’ll be amazed,
you’ll have so much of energy.

25:54.140 --> 26:02.515
So much energy is wasted in thinking.
And what do you think?

26:02.540 --> 26:05.928
If you ask somebody: “What are you
thinking?”

26:05.953 --> 26:10.537
“Everything.” But “everything”
means what?

26:10.562 --> 26:16.390
Why do you think so much?
What is the need to think?

26:16.415 --> 26:23.420
It’s a habit, human habit to go on
thinking about everything.

26:23.445 --> 26:28.722
For example, just now, there are
three carpets here.

26:28.747 --> 26:36.359
Now, if I put attention on it I’ll just
see how nice they are; I’ll just enjoy

26:36.384 --> 26:41.113
- enjoy what the artists have done,
that’s all.

26:41.138 --> 26:45.899
No words - nothing. Just the enjoyment
within yourself.

26:45.924 --> 26:49.467
But if you ask somebody else,
he’ll just start saying,

26:49.492 --> 26:52.219
“Oh, this is not good.
That’s not good.

26:52.244 --> 26:56.646
This much some price, that price,
this thing, that thing.”

26:56.671 --> 27:00.542
The joy of that artist is finished.

27:00.567 --> 27:06.563
You cannot get that joy,

27:07.920 --> 27:15.646
that joy about which we are seeking.
What we are seeking is joy,

27:15.671 --> 27:20.882
and even when you have got a way
of doing it you do not achieve it.

27:20.907 --> 27:26.760
Because thinking is a reaction,
reaction to everything,

27:26.785 --> 27:30.032
and it makes the life so miserable.

27:30.057 --> 27:34.755
It makes the life of the person who
thinks and of others also.

27:34.780 --> 27:40.568
I’ll give you an example. This whole
thing we got it done

27:40.593 --> 27:45.816
just because it’s very heavy rains
and also we have

27:45.841 --> 27:49.692
problems of sometimes snowing.

27:49.724 --> 27:52.968
So I thought that’s a nice thing
to have a nice thing done

27:52.993 --> 27:56.394
and it’s very well done, we got it.

27:56.419 --> 28:02.334
Now, there are thinking people
in this Italy. Lots of them.

28:02.359 --> 28:08.995
That’s why it’s not progressing.
Now, we applied three years back.

28:09.020 --> 28:14.278
Three years they kept our money
locked up in the bank, imagine.

28:14.303 --> 28:18.864
And first time they said, “All right,
everything is fine, it’s all right.

28:18.889 --> 28:25.138
You can have it.” It had seventy
signatures

28:25.163 --> 28:28.839
of these Italians, so-called.

28:28.864 --> 28:33.310
And then they came round to say,
the same people,

28:33.335 --> 28:37.949
“No, no, no, you must change it
to copper”. I said, “Why?”

28:37.974 --> 28:42.742
“Because copper will be aesthetically
very good.”

28:42.767 --> 28:47.254
But don’t they know, stupid people,
that copper will look the same

28:47.279 --> 28:54.346
as they are looking? After one month
only they will have the same colour?

28:54.967 --> 28:58.162
This is the idea of aesthetics,
and now I have told them,

28:58.187 --> 29:03.572
“We don’t want your land, you keep it
to yourself, give us back our money.”

29:03.597 --> 29:07.204
With a simple thing like that.

29:07.229 --> 29:14.163
Why? Because they have a committee,
there is “rejune, bijune, sijune”.

29:14.188 --> 29:17.374
You have to go through all that
nonsense,

29:17.399 --> 29:20.280
because they all sit down on chairs,
very seriously,

29:20.305 --> 29:23.605
“We must discuss, we must consult,
we must ask everyone,

29:23.630 --> 29:28.681
and then this and that”. And ultimately
what comes?

29:28.706 --> 29:33.582
No progress of any kind. There is
no peace.

29:33.607 --> 29:38.120
Maybe, I don’t know, maybe some
underhand dealings are needed,

29:38.145 --> 29:43.432
for which they are feeling shy to tell
Me. I don’t know what is the thing is,

29:43.457 --> 29:49.283
but still I can’t understand when
the one office says “Yes”

29:49.308 --> 29:57.004
and again, when it comes back to it,
it says “No”. Three years.

29:57.029 --> 30:04.917
So, what I am trying to say that
thinking too much is a sign of ego.

30:04.942 --> 30:10.271
But, they don’t find any solutions,
no solutions of any kind.

30:10.296 --> 30:16.580
They’ll never hit the solution. Because
they are just discussing,

30:16.605 --> 30:23.452
arguing, thinking - they have
no solutions.

30:29.703 --> 30:39.688
Now, it is important that sahaja yogis
have to do introspection,

30:39.713 --> 30:47.418
introspection - inward. Introspection
is inward-looking.

30:47.443 --> 30:51.383
Inward-looking. “Why I am thinking?
What am I thinking?

30:51.408 --> 30:54.987
What is the need to think?”.

30:55.738 --> 31:02.345
You will become Nirvichara. Don’t allow
your mind to befool you.

31:02.370 --> 31:06.593
This mind is like a monkey, I tell you,
it’s really like a monkey.

31:06.618 --> 31:10.542
And when it starts working it makes you
jump from this end to that end,

31:10.567 --> 31:15.901
that end to that end. And if you reach
some conclusions, so-called,

31:15.926 --> 31:21.941
and if it is not achieved then you are
the most miserable person.

31:21.966 --> 31:31.420
I have seen people thinning down only
thinking about something which is absurd.

31:31.445 --> 31:34.273
And you can see out of this thinking
what comes out

31:34.298 --> 31:40.920
on a global level also. What is
the need to go to the moon?

31:40.945 --> 31:44.605
So many people are starved,
are dying out.

31:44.630 --> 31:49.111
What is the need to go to Mars?

31:49.136 --> 31:53.578
What are they going to get from there?
Because they formed a habit.

31:53.603 --> 31:56.297
First they came to India, then went
to China,

31:56.322 --> 32:02.542
then went to this, then went to that;
they can’t sit down, settle down.

32:02.567 --> 32:06.689
They can’t settle down in the house
also.

32:06.714 --> 32:11.273
Specially men. If you are travelling
by train,

32:11.298 --> 32:16.321
even if the train stops for two minutes
men must get out.

32:16.354 --> 32:20.188
The wife will be worried now. And while
the train will be moving

32:20.213 --> 32:23.597
then they’ll jump in.

32:23.622 --> 32:28.858
It’s a cracked brain, I think, like a -
even why say they are like a monkey?

32:28.883 --> 32:32.927
Because monkeys won’t do that.

32:32.952 --> 32:39.942
It’s that they cannot stationary
remain in one place.

32:39.967 --> 32:45.158
Now, in meditation you have
to sit down, in one place,

32:45.183 --> 32:50.438
not to jump from here to there,
there to there. This is very difficult.

32:50.463 --> 32:55.420
Women have other problems.
While cooking they’ll meditate.

32:55.445 --> 32:57.724
They have no time!

32:57.749 --> 33:01.989
They have their friends, they have
to go to shopping,

33:02.014 --> 33:07.164
to buy things and fill the house
with all kinds of rubbish.

33:07.189 --> 33:11.323
They have no time for anything.
They are also very adventurous.

33:11.348 --> 33:14.814
They want to do business, they want
to do this, they want to do that.

33:14.839 --> 33:18.261
For meditation they have no time.

33:18.286 --> 33:26.244
So, settling down is very important.
Settle down with yourself.

33:26.664 --> 33:33.775
So, once someone told Me, “Mother, if
we settle down, we’ll become very fat.”

33:35.248 --> 33:40.984
All right, doesn’t matter -
but you settle down.

33:41.995 --> 33:47.800
All sorts of excuses are there
not to meditate.

33:47.825 --> 33:54.956
“Yes, I meditate, Mother, but you know,
so difficult in these modern times.

33:55.631 --> 34:00.060
There are crises in our lives,
there are problems in our lives.”

34:00.085 --> 34:04.499
But actually you’ll be amazed, when
there’s a crisis, say, in My family

34:04.524 --> 34:08.793
or in Sahaja Yoga, immediately
I become thoughtless.

34:08.818 --> 34:11.062
Spontaneously I become thoughtless,

34:11.087 --> 34:17.045
because the problem will be solved
by the Paramchaitanya.

34:17.070 --> 34:21.213
The Paramchaitanya is going to solve
the problem, why should I think?

34:21.238 --> 34:24.362
Forget it. Let the Paramchaitanya
look after.

34:24.387 --> 34:27.376
If you don’t depend on your
Paramchaitanya,

34:27.401 --> 34:31.366
it doesn’t help you. Doesn’t give you
any solutions.

34:31.391 --> 34:39.422
Then you go on round and round and round
with your brain and work it out.

34:39.926 --> 34:45.438
This is what you have to know definitely
that you are connected

34:45.463 --> 34:50.053
to the all-pervading Power
of Divine love.

34:50.078 --> 34:55.999
This is not love which is stupid -
love that thinks.

34:56.024 --> 35:01.713
Love that is truth. Love that is
joy.

35:01.738 --> 35:09.530
All this is built in within you, and now
you have got realization,

35:09.555 --> 35:18.873
so instead of evolving yourself, you just
jump into things which are of no value.

35:19.406 --> 35:26.555
And so many Sahaja Yogis get lost.
I was recently told by someone

35:26.580 --> 35:29.064
that we have lost about hundred
sahaja yogis,

35:29.089 --> 35:35.883
because they started following another
sahaja yogi, who started seeing things.

35:36.407 --> 35:39.999
So they also wanted to see.

35:40.024 --> 35:48.608
If you can see something that means
you are not there, simple thing.

35:50.482 --> 35:56.535
If I am, say, on the top of a mountain,
then I’m there.

35:56.560 --> 36:00.156
But if I am away from the mountain
I can see it.

36:00.181 --> 36:05.865
The more you see something that means
you are away from it.

36:05.890 --> 36:08.388
Did you follow this point?

36:08.413 --> 36:16.268
So, the subtle, the sukshma,
state is that

36:16.293 --> 36:21.708
where you are yourself that.

36:22.156 --> 36:26.704
So, how can you see yourself?

36:26.729 --> 36:30.958
This is the point Sahaja Yogis must
understand. Anybody who can –

36:30.983 --> 36:34.883
“Mother, oh no he can see, he saw
auras around You,

36:34.908 --> 36:41.095
he can see this thing.” So,
how can you see?

36:41.120 --> 36:46.311
Because you are that, you can’t see.
So, all such people

36:46.336 --> 36:50.505
who are very popular sometimes,
in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga

36:50.530 --> 36:58.540
try to control you and befool you.
And then you are thrown out.

36:58.820 --> 37:04.176
Now, this is what we call is
the judgement.

37:04.201 --> 37:11.259
There are sieves and sieves and sieves
through which you have to pass.

37:11.625 --> 37:18.055
Where you get enamoured by this or that, or you fall for this or that,

37:18.080 --> 37:26.251
all these things are there in a step-
by-step how you are arriving.

37:27.601 --> 37:35.409
You are arriving at that point where
your destruction is sure.

37:35.434 --> 37:42.738
Because you have to become the Spirit.
You have to rise in spiritual life.

37:42.763 --> 37:48.593
And if your movement is downward,
who can help you?

37:48.618 --> 37:55.648
This is a very interesting time as I told
you, is the time of judgement.

37:55.673 --> 38:02.028
And at this time we have to be careful
that we are our own judges.

38:02.053 --> 38:06.851
Nobody has to tell you that you are
catching this one and catching that one.

38:06.876 --> 38:12.913
You yourself can feel it what chakras
you are catching.

38:12.938 --> 38:17.028
Whatever I may try on My own

38:17.053 --> 38:21.667
to suck in all your problems,
do whatever is possible,

38:21.692 --> 38:29.193
to keep you rising and rising and rising,
but what I feel

38:29.218 --> 38:41.598
that this method of helping you
will not make you so strong,

38:41.623 --> 38:45.696
because you’ll always think that,
“After all, Mother will suck my problem.”

38:45.721 --> 38:50.610
If I get hundred letters, out of them
ninety-nine are of sahaja yogis

38:50.635 --> 38:57.068
who are suffering from this trouble
or that trouble. I’m amazed,

38:57.093 --> 39:05.134
you have all these qualities already
awakened in you, they are in you.

39:06.577 --> 39:09.449
You use them.

39:10.864 --> 39:13.452
Somebody will say, “That fellow
is troubling me,

39:13.477 --> 39:19.503
that wife is troubling me, the husband
troubling me.” Just forgive!

39:19.528 --> 39:26.441
Just forgive! Your power of forgiveness
is poor.

39:26.466 --> 39:30.626
Moreover, more than what the saints
have written

39:30.651 --> 39:40.145
you have got the power of truth.
You know the reality.

39:40.450 --> 39:47.015
Much more than those saints who
have praised the Goddess.

39:47.579 --> 39:51.717
If you could just think as to what
level you are sitting

39:51.742 --> 39:59.102
you wouldn’t fall, you wouldn’t go
down that much.

39:59.127 --> 40:05.068
Only problem is you have to know that
your ascent has to be spiritual,

40:05.093 --> 40:12.571
and already these qualities are very
well balanced and put within you.

40:12.596 --> 40:18.537
More than dharma. Dharma maybe,
you have a power

40:18.562 --> 40:27.410
to give up or to fall down, but these
powers are never destroyed within you.

40:27.659 --> 40:35.715
I remember once I went to America
first time and I met one gentleman.

40:35.740 --> 40:38.382
The next day he came and he told Me,
“Mother, I am changed,

40:38.407 --> 40:41.988
I am changed, I am changed.”
“What happened?”

40:42.013 --> 40:47.357
“You know, I used to hate my uncle,
I never wanted to talk to him,

40:47.382 --> 40:53.102
very angry with him, but this time,
just imagine,

40:53.127 --> 40:58.376
yesterday I met him, I went and hugged
him, and kissed him, and I said,

40:58.401 --> 41:01.131
‘Now, I have forgiven you,
completely forgiven you,

41:01.156 --> 41:05.520
now don’t think about feeling guilty
about it.

41:05.545 --> 41:10.112
He started looking at me
like this.’”

41:10.760 --> 41:12.905
So, with the Kundalini awakening

41:12.930 --> 41:18.619
all these beautiful qualities you have
will come up.

41:18.644 --> 41:24.111
And then your generosity,

41:25.758 --> 41:32.280
your beautiful being, which is
enlightened by the Spirit

41:32.305 --> 41:39.154
will prove to the world that Sahaja
Yoga is the truth.

41:40.637 --> 41:48.921
Yesterday’s beautiful dramas
have shown us,

41:48.946 --> 41:54.053
but it should not be a mental
satisfaction within you,

41:54.078 --> 41:56.500
that “I have got the realization,
now I am this”.

41:56.525 --> 42:04.244
No. No. No mental. It’s a state,
it’s a state,

42:04.269 --> 42:08.848
and that state to achieve, you have
to really meditate

42:08.873 --> 42:18.684
and find time for meditation
every night, every morning.

42:18.709 --> 42:22.925
The more you’ll meditate the better
it will be.

42:22.950 --> 42:32.847
No excuses are to be given or to be
convincing to yourself.

42:32.872 --> 42:39.093
Everything is unimportant. Your ascent
is very important,

42:39.118 --> 42:44.804
if you really want to save this world
from - in this Kali Yuga.

42:44.829 --> 42:49.677
I think today I have made it
very clear to you

42:49.702 --> 42:55.644
what qualities already are instilled
within you.

42:55.669 --> 43:02.225
They are there. They are not dharmas,
but qualities.

43:02.250 --> 43:04.792
They are just within you,

43:04.817 --> 43:11.362
only thing you have turned your attention
to something opposite,

43:11.387 --> 43:16.477
otherwise all these qualities are
already instilled within you.

43:16.502 --> 43:23.641
They are already there. And nothing can
destroy them, except for you yourself.

43:23.666 --> 43:28.252
If you have destroyed them,
nobody can help.

43:28.277 --> 43:32.119
May God bless you all.
