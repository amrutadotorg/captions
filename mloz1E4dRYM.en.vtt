00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.269
But with this power you become so

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.910
much full of compassion.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.120
Then your attention goes from you to others.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.239
What you can do for others? How can you give them realization and suddenly  you discover

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.599
that around you is so many destructive forces, so many disturbing forces,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.200
so many problems, suddenly you find the discipline.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:39.230
If you can transform human being, but it's no question of transformation. I would say it is the question of evolutionary

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:45.079
processes and when this takes place you find you are transformed completely.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.900
And thousands have to be transformed.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.799
Thousands and thousands and millions and millions, but somehow

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.739
America has a different type of approach

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.649
to

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:58.270
spirituality.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.330
They think, if I don't take money then something wrong with me.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.930
I must accept money .

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.450
They have told me so many things, some experts came and told me.

00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:12.686
Explained to me all the economics and all that, which I don't understand.

00:01:13.199 --> 00:01:16.755
And they think, that it should be saleable.

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.209
Can't understand  this  kind of a thing, how much will you pay first Christ?

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:26.749
How much will you pay for any

00:01:26.876 --> 00:01:28.876
saintly personality?

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:32.050
Because
It is

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.710
this value can not be charged.It's invalueable.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.430
Something that's the most invaluable for you

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.970
Is to know yourself.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:51.190
if you have not known yourself, you're still going round and round and round in the mad rush of thinking.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.090
Even Einstein, you'll be surprised, has talked about it, that he was trying to find

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.858
the theory of relativity

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.950
and just he couldn't find it.

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:11.179
So he went into his garden and was playing with soap bubbles and suddenly from somewhere unknown, that's what he says,

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:13.959
the theory of relativity

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:18.439
dawned upon him and he called that unknown area

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:26.779
he calls them by a name and that name is rather to me not so precise.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.510
But he says there is an area

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.429
Which you can exploit, by which you can

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.190
understand

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.139
for the future

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:46.099
generation, for the future scientist, where you get the ideas from there, and he said for that you must have

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.739
a kind of a personality, that can perceive

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.419
that torsion area, from where the ideas are coming.

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.639
If you can enter into the that area,  you can get

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.759
the full idea as to

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:07.429
what is reality.

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:12.269
He calls it cognitive, he says

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.939
this is a cognitive science and such a person can tell you so many things

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:21.168
which will you put it to the scientific test, you'll find it's

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:28.098
absolutely correct. And this is what happened to him because himself was a realized soul and

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.059
many people like Newton himself was a realized soul.

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:40.609
Abraham Lincoln was a realized soul, but they could not tell about it to others ,because nobody would believe and

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:47.430
anybody trying to tell anything they just used to torture them. Every saint, real saint

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.530
I mean, has been tortured,  every sufi has been tortured.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.510
In our country especially many saints have been very badly treated.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.730
Also in other countries. Why?

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:08.329
Because they are only one and maybe people were jealous, that how could they know so much, how could they talk about so many things?

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:17.659
Now with all this, now only think if I have done anything is very simple that I thought no use

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:24.348
giving this realization to one or two person , which was a tradition to give to only one to one.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.219
But now I felt it won't work out.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.190
We have to have it for the masses.

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:38.989
And I just what I did was to find out a method  by which I can give a mass realization.

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:45.558
That's all, which is a simple thing and that is working and it worked very well.

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:47.839
As I said, in America

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:54.169
they just think of this another achievement of human beings, that they know about money.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:01.430
So money, money, money, everything money, so they can't understand even spirituality without money.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.270
But in a place like, we can say, Russia.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:12.639
Russia people, Russian people had no freedom as you have and they had oppression

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.879
from all sides in there.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.630
As you know the

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.039
whole thing was a

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:27.039
communistic country and in that communism they were completely oppressed.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.310
So as a result

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.310
they went inside themselves and tried to find out

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.400
solutions inside.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.470
So when they saw me.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.550
Just seeing me,  I don't know how

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:46.900
thousands of them came now we have thousands and thousands and thousands of people in Russia alone.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.630
Also in other some countries, I mean,

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.130
I mean I see here,

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.290
I'm just thinking in Russia we have to take

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.170
they cannot put it in a hall. We have to have a big tent or

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:09.730
olympics where they had some sort of a thing like that. So the trouble is we should give up this idea

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.639
that I can find it for myself. This is very very common, you cannot.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.690
This is the only evolution in which you

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.259
have to get it from an enlightened person.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.230
You have to humble on this point that

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.239
I can't get it on my own, I can find my own,way you cannot

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.160
you'll be lost. You have to have somebody, who is already enlightened.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.670
Now how to get an enlightened person also. How to?

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:47.410
Because after realization you know the absolute truth on your fingertips you can feel

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.410
the centers of other person.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.979
If something is fishy, you can feel it.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.730
If somebody is cheating, you can feel it ,everything ,your fingers speak.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:06.610
This is what Muhammad Sahib has said:  At the time of resurrection your hands will speak. Clearly, how can hand speak?

00:07:07.096 --> 00:07:12.455
This is how. Because all these five fingers are the centers, sixth and seventh center.
