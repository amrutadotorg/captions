1
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:15,762
So where is the attention placed in the human being?

2
00:00:15,842 --> 00:00:19,422
It is not a fixed point.

3
00:00:20,594 --> 00:00:32,461
You can say, attention is the surface or the edge of awareness.

4
00:00:37,715 --> 00:00:46,425
Wherever we are made aware, the attention gets diverted to that point.

5
00:00:56,477 --> 00:01:05,885
If you can find some analogy,

6
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:12,219
all the files (filings) of iron

7
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:19,652
have got a power to be attracted towards the magnet.

8
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:28,290
Where is that power, you cannot locate – it is all over.

9
00:01:28,382 --> 00:01:35,581
Wherever the magnet is placed the files are attracted.

10
00:01:35,702 --> 00:01:41,070
Our attention is also like that,

11
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:47,814
that wherever we are attracted, our attention goes there.

12
00:01:51,204 --> 00:01:56,938
It is existing in the whole body,

13
00:01:57,018 --> 00:02:02,269
in the sense that it can be diverted anywhere, outside the body.

14
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:10,971
Also inside the body, in case if there is any pain or there is any trouble.

15
00:02:15,925 --> 00:02:23,549
It floats over the nerves,

16
00:02:24,308 --> 00:02:29,865
it floats over the whole nervous system,

17
00:02:33,492 --> 00:02:41,438
but there is a controlling centre in the brain.

18
00:02:42,891 --> 00:02:57,084
If it is hit then we can remain conscious, but without any attention.

19
00:03:02,852 --> 00:03:11,405
Also, if somebody is hit on the Vishuddhi Chakra, it can happen.

20
00:03:11,485 --> 00:03:16,452
It can happen even in the lower chakras if somebody is hit.

21
00:03:16,532 --> 00:03:30,645
That portion will lose its attention because you cannot feel, in that part.

22
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:43,598
The difference is this, that you can pay attention to those points,

23
00:03:43,678 --> 00:03:46,005
if you want to, even if they are numbed.

24
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:49,878
For example, if my hand is numb I can pay attention to that,

25
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:54,612
means I can look at it, I can think of it,

26
00:03:54,692 --> 00:04:04,195
but there is a point in our being [which], if that is hit

27
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:11,025
then we cannot even think, we are just lying unconscious they say,

28
00:04:11,105 --> 00:04:17,132
but eyes are open, hands are moving, legs are moving.

29
00:04:17,212 --> 00:04:24,452
That point is at the point of Vishuddhi Chakra here.

30
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:29,572
And if yo u can draw a line from here

31
00:04:29,652 --> 00:04:41,555
to the point where is the peetha of Vishuddhi Chakra is inside, inside the brain;

32
00:04:43,712 --> 00:04:52,132
along that line if you are hit anywhere you become attention-less,

33
00:04:52,212 --> 00:04:54,805
you cannot pay attention anywhere.

34
00:05:07,832 --> 00:05:19,295
This line passes through, also, Agya Chakra.

35
00:05:20,075 --> 00:05:28,198
Because when this point is connected with Vishuddhi Chakra at the back,

36
00:05:28,278 --> 00:05:35,278
in here, and at the peetha inside, then a kind of a triangle is formed

37
00:05:35,358 --> 00:05:42,175
and all this line or this area can affect your attention.

38
00:05:43,805 --> 00:05:48,998
Your heart is moving, your limbs are moving

39
00:05:49,078 --> 00:05:53,075
but you are not paying attention anywhere.

40
00:06:07,085 --> 00:06:18,452
So when you pay attention to something, actually you pay attention, normally

41
00:06:20,778 --> 00:06:24,345
– when you are not realised –

42
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,495
through your brain centres.

43
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:41,018
After realisation, you can pay attention 
through your other centres also. You do pay.

44
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:48,935
This is a very big difference between a person 
who is realised and who is not realised.

45
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:57,092
Or you can say that you can become effective

46
00:06:57,172 --> 00:07:01,335
through your other centres by paying attention to them.

47
00:07:04,745 --> 00:07:12,635
You can feel the centres which are obstructed in your body, 
which you never felt before.

48
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:20,225
Not only that, but you can feel the centres of other people.

49
00:07:20,305 --> 00:07:32,075
That means your central nervous system is being blessed by a new awareness

50
00:07:32,172 --> 00:07:38,592
by which it can convey to you, communicate to you,

51
00:07:38,672 --> 00:07:44,445
the attention paid by your centres and also it can take your attention

52
00:07:44,525 --> 00:07:49,772
in a subtler way into the centres of others.

53
00:07:50,505 --> 00:07:57,835
So, first thing that happens to you is that your attention becomes subtler.

54
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:12,135
Attention becoming subtler means you start understanding deeper things.

55
00:08:13,635 --> 00:08:23,692
For example, a bird can see a flower but cannot feel the beauty of a flower.

56
00:08:26,185 --> 00:08:33,232
And a unrealised person can see the beauty of a flower,

57
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:37,695
but cannot see the vibrations of the flower.

58
00:08:39,498 --> 00:08:47,535
So you become subtler, your attention becomes subtler.

59
00:08:52,672 --> 00:08:59,552
You definitely are at a higher evolutionary stage than the other people are.
