00:05:01.201 --> 00:05:06.875
It's a great day today for the whole world

00:05:07.222 --> 00:05:17.333
that we are celebrating this Diwali Puja in America.

00:05:19.867 --> 00:05:22.857
It's very important.

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:35.904
Here where people have been able to earn money,
to have lots of money sometimes,

00:05:36.437 --> 00:05:43.937
and are also people who are ruined completely because of money.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:54.127
When we talk of Diwali we should understand

00:05:54.185 --> 00:06:00.016
that why on a Diwali day we have all these lights.

00:06:00.495 --> 00:06:13.754
What is the combination of lights and the
Lakshmi who was born in the water,

00:06:14.071 --> 00:06:16.522
who stands in the water?

00:06:17.415 --> 00:06:20.391
Why this combination is there?

00:06:21.103 --> 00:06:32.615
She was standing in the water, as we know,
a symbol of prosperity;

00:06:33.496 --> 00:06:42.339
 that is built in the human awareness that it can, he can prosper.

00:06:42.654 --> 00:06:44.944
Animals don't prosper.

00:06:45.008 --> 00:06:54.290
They all have their maryadas, trees have their
maryadas, only the human being can prosper.

00:06:54.315 --> 00:06:59.942
But if they have no sense of their own maryadas

00:07:00.015 --> 00:07:06.471
then there's very ruinous, are ruinous for the whole world.

00:07:07.533 --> 00:07:19.752
So the lights are there that all the people
who have Lakshmi's blessings must enlighten themselves,

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:25.927
 must have lights, and they should enlighten others also.

00:07:26.816 --> 00:07:35.200
But actually, as soon as they get the Lakshmi
- so-called - they become absolutely blind,

00:07:35.558 --> 00:07:44.975
and they forget what is behind
the blessings of the Lakshmi.

00:07:45.286 --> 00:07:53.699
First of all, as we see, how this symbol of Lakshmi represents -
I have told you before also -

00:07:54.046 --> 00:08:05.237
 that a person who has Lakshmi should
be very generous.

00:08:05.616 --> 00:08:13.044
One hand she's giving to others.

00:08:13.403 --> 00:08:23.391
A person who is miserly with Lakshmi is absolutely
against the principle of Lakshmi.

00:08:23.814 --> 00:08:29.141
And such a miserly person never can enjoy the blessings;

00:08:29.622 --> 00:08:36.413
 and gradually he starts becoming poorer and poorer.

00:08:36.619 --> 00:08:42.571
When you start giving with the left hand,
that means

00:08:42.729 --> 00:08:48.169
you have opened the door for your Lakshmi to come in.

00:08:48.731 --> 00:08:57.424
Then comes the grace of Lakshmi on you.

00:08:57.711 --> 00:09:11.035
And this grace of Lakshmi also has another
aspect, that you must give protection.

00:09:12.312 --> 00:09:24.058
Those who are people with money should protect
like this - protect who?

00:09:24.335 --> 00:09:35.362
Protect the people who are in trouble, people
who are having lots of cruelty on them,

00:09:35.567 --> 00:09:39.958
orphan children who need your help.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:49.540
All these should be looked into, and the protection
to the people who are dependent on you.

00:09:49.787 --> 00:09:53.817
So this has to be done with the right hand.

00:09:54.127 --> 00:09:58.374
That's the symbol of Lakshmi.

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:08.084
And there are two hands up there, which you
have seen, with the pink color lotus.

00:10:08.534 --> 00:10:15.957
Pink color lotus suggests that you must have
love in your heart.

00:10:16.141 --> 00:10:20.947
Pink is the symbol of love and compassion.

00:10:21.688 --> 00:10:30.765
As I've told you before also, a person who
has Lakshmi should have

00:10:31.567 --> 00:10:37.074
a house where everybody's invited.

00:10:37.312 --> 00:10:46.451
Like the lotus invites all the insects, even
the beetles who have got lots of thorns,

00:10:46.538 --> 00:10:55.016
and the beetle comes and sleeps the whole night
very comfortably, and the lotus closes its petals

00:10:55.238 --> 00:11:00.499
 so that the beetle has no trouble to
be comfortable.

00:11:00.604 --> 00:11:11.955
So these houses must accept guests, any kind
they are, and they should be treated

00:11:12.058 --> 00:11:22.267
very well, just like as if the Gods have come into your house.

00:11:22.387 --> 00:11:30.259
I've seen people who are poor are much more
hospitable than the people who are rich.

00:11:30.353 --> 00:11:33.037
Same way about the countries.

00:11:33.087 --> 00:11:41.935
Countries which are poor are much more hospitable
than the countries which are rich.

00:11:42.025 --> 00:11:47.894
It's very surprising that rich countries have
their immigrations,

00:11:47.921 --> 00:11:56.206
 they have all problems of avoiding people,
 guests in their own countries.

00:11:56.298 --> 00:12:02.238
So they are going really in the wrong way as far as

00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:05.273
 the Lakshmi symbols are concerned.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:11.405
The another very important symbol is that
she stands on a lotus.

00:12:11.516 --> 00:12:20.565
It's all glorified, all beautiful lotuses
carrying her: but lotus suggests that she

00:12:20.952 --> 00:12:32.788
throws no pressures, no imbalances, no power around.

00:12:33.121 --> 00:12:40.656
But in these countries where people have money,
they try to throw power all around.

00:12:40.786 --> 00:12:45.427
And one who has money becomes the more powerful person.

00:12:45.535 --> 00:12:49.165
Everything becomes power.

00:12:49.931 --> 00:12:53.714
Money is power, love is power.

00:12:54.285 --> 00:13:05.955
This power has no divinity in it, but a power
of oppression and aggression and self-importance.

00:13:06.778 --> 00:13:12.092
All these symbols of the Lakshmi are very

00:13:12.235 --> 00:13:16.607
convincing, that today when we say that somebody has got money,

00:13:16.632 --> 00:13:22.322
or some country or nation, they are just
the opposite of what they should have been.

00:13:23.447 --> 00:13:27.057
The reason is they are not enlightened.

00:13:27.652 --> 00:13:35.970
They have to have lights in their heart, as
we see that in Diwali, there has to be the light;

00:13:36.109 --> 00:13:49.526
 and without enlightenment these rich
people, so-called Lakshmipathis, become nonsensical.

00:13:49.734 --> 00:13:53.243
That's why there has to be the light.

00:13:53.359 --> 00:14:01.288
Because with Lakshmi one can become absolutely
blind - so-called Lakshmi, doesn't give you

00:14:01.628 --> 00:14:08.568
proper understanding as to what it means that
you have got money, that you are rich.

00:14:08.609 --> 00:14:10.249
What does that mean?

00:14:10.591 --> 00:14:13.805
That's why one has to have the lights.

00:14:13.956 --> 00:14:21.664
Unless and until you have light of divinity
within you, you won't understand

00:14:22.082 --> 00:14:25.143
 the great symbol of Lakshmi.

00:14:25.336 --> 00:14:33.471
But in Sahaja Yoga we believe that the Lakshmi
must become Mahalakshmi.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:41.440
Man has to become greater, [SOUNDS LIKE MAHAMANAVA].

00:14:41.756 --> 00:14:43.410
What does that mean?

00:14:43.512 --> 00:14:47.423
That she has to become the Mahalakshmi.

00:14:47.545 --> 00:15:03.515
Mahalakshmi is a Deity which makes you absolutely
satisfied with whatever you have.

00:15:03.786 --> 00:15:05.952
Complete satisfaction.

00:15:06.095 --> 00:15:16.616
Not only that, but you start thinking that
"Whatever I have is not sufficient -

00:15:16.743 --> 00:15:19.416
 I have to have something else!

00:15:19.516 --> 00:15:26.526
Not money, not more cars, not more televisions
and things,

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:33.287
but I have to have something else
that will give me real satisfaction."

00:15:34.405 --> 00:15:41.104
You know the law of economics is that you
are never satisfied.

00:15:41.277 --> 00:15:49.105
Nothing is satiable, so you go on buying from
one to another to another to another, another.

00:15:49.462 --> 00:15:55.700
But when the Mahalakshmi principle shines in you,

00:15:55.806 --> 00:16:00.941
then you do not want any more.

00:16:01.544 --> 00:16:08.641
You want to give it to others and you want
to enjoy your generosity.

00:16:08.895 --> 00:16:15.381
That is the first sign that you are moving
now from Lakshmi to Mahalakshmi.

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:23.556
Till the Lakshmi principle, you were blind;
and whatever it was,

00:16:23.656 --> 00:16:29.921
you were more asking for more things
and more things, and more things.

00:16:30.407 --> 00:16:39.837
After this is over, then you have the light
enlightenment.

00:16:40.155 --> 00:16:53.677
When you have done all the four things properly
- that is generosity, protection and hospitality and compassion -

00:16:54.287 --> 00:17:04.599
 then you get into another mood of movement

00:17:04.677 --> 00:17:12.392
because you know nothing is satisfying, nothing is satiable.

00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:19.540
Running from one thing to another, then that
to another, that to another.

00:17:19.858 --> 00:17:30.438
And when such people get collective, they
start ways and methods of attracting people

00:17:30.636 --> 00:17:33.524
how they could extract money.

00:17:33.733 --> 00:17:35.373
There's so many ways.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:41.230
Like in our Italy when I was there, I wanted to buy shoes.

00:17:41.343 --> 00:17:46.731
We went to the shop and they had only one type of shoe.

00:17:46.827 --> 00:17:51.151
That kind I don't wear, so said, "No."

00:17:51.176 --> 00:17:54.686
Now, "Only this year this kind."

00:17:55.977 --> 00:17:57.737
"Only this kind?"

00:17:57.737 --> 00:18:00.127
"Every shop will have this."

00:18:00.127 --> 00:18:05.564
I said, "People have no sense, they have no life within them.

00:18:05.687 --> 00:18:09.527
So next year, you'll have another style."

00:18:09.837 --> 00:18:16.988
Whatever is produced is always new, and these
shoes that were made last year

00:18:17.043 --> 00:18:22.638
 or before that are put into some sort of a junk.

00:18:23.442 --> 00:18:26.192
It's a very big business.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:36.983
So it is the big business that starts in this
manner, and many people become bankrupt,

00:18:37.092 --> 00:18:45.562
many people completely lose their dignity, and
fall into the trap of immorality.

00:18:46.664 --> 00:18:50.458
So this Lakshmi principle if you forget,

00:18:50.513 --> 00:18:55.232
 in a proper way you cannot go to the Mahalakshmi principle.

00:18:55.643 --> 00:19:08.124
And in the Mahalakshmi way you can find another
kind of personalities,

00:19:08.434 --> 00:19:13.040
because if you have the light in your heart,

00:19:13.096 --> 00:19:20.011
then you start seeing that this money business is of no satisfaction.

00:19:20.178 --> 00:19:24.663
You go on changing from one to another.

00:19:25.127 --> 00:19:28.078
So then you think, "What should we do?"

00:19:28.221 --> 00:19:33.610
With this light in your heart, you find out that you have to follow

00:19:33.689 --> 00:19:39.832
now the principle of Mahalakshmi otherwise you'll be lost.

00:19:40.044 --> 00:19:48.075
So when you think of Mahalakshmi you start
seeking, seeking the way by which

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:54.253
 you can really have a real satisfaction of life.

00:19:56.355 --> 00:20:01.445
I mean a country like America where people
have so much money and everything,

00:20:01.596 --> 00:20:08.115
 they have also the maximum number of seekers - maximum.

00:20:08.615 --> 00:20:16.083
When I first came to America I was shocked
that though there was Mahalakshmi principle,

00:20:16.234 --> 00:20:22.852
they did not know what to seek and they all
followed all kinds of false gurus.

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:30.938
They had become mad, I think, because they
couldn't understand what is to befall be followed.

00:20:31.152 --> 00:20:38.562
For that they started following all kinds of false gurus,

00:20:39.331 --> 00:20:47.251
who were themselves slaves of Lakshmi - Lakshmitattwa - slaves in the
sense 'who were against' Lakshmitattwa.

00:20:47.402 --> 00:20:54.313
And that's how they all were lost, so many
of were lost in this country, and I was shocked

00:20:54.392 --> 00:20:58.678
the way they were following wrong type of
people I just thought that

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:03.420
there's something really needed to be done to this country.

00:21:03.611 --> 00:21:07.535
And for nine years I never came to America.

00:21:07.781 --> 00:21:14.267
I am sorry for that, because the seekers were
moving in the opposite direction.

00:21:14.604 --> 00:21:22.540
They were not in the understanding as to what
the seeking is for.

00:21:22.646 --> 00:21:25.765
What are you seeking?

00:21:26.151 --> 00:21:37.323
Somebody came saying that "You are, I am a
sixteen-year-old and I can make you all realized souls."

00:21:37.429 --> 00:21:46.791
And I'm told that he put some vermilion
kumkum in a gun and blasted it,

00:21:46.863 --> 00:21:51.035
and people felt they were all, already have gone to heavens.

00:21:51.234 --> 00:21:57.174
Such idiotic behavior; how it came into their heads, I don't know.

00:21:57.429 --> 00:22:01.008
How did they become so idiotic, I can't understand.

00:22:01.409 --> 00:22:08.294
So I went back and I said: "I can't help these people much."

00:22:11.733 --> 00:22:15.521
Then a kind of another fashion started.

00:22:15.835 --> 00:22:23.085
Like if you went to any party or anything
they would say, "Now see, another guru has come.

00:22:23.276 --> 00:22:25.585
He's much cheaper.

00:22:25.832 --> 00:22:29.205
And But also there's a sale on."

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:33.730
And I would say "Look at these women and men

00:22:33.864 --> 00:22:41.740
who are supposed to be the leaders of the world,
 and how can they talk like this?"

00:22:41.949 --> 00:22:48.899
It was a very common thing among the rich people to talk like that.

00:22:50.256 --> 00:22:58.959
This country has been blessed with very, very
great people, as you know, very great.

00:22:59.701 --> 00:23:03.893
Abraham Lincoln - what sort of a man he was.

00:23:03.923 --> 00:23:06.832
Or even say George Washington.

00:23:07.007 --> 00:23:12.354
All these people showed the quality of Mahalakshmi.

00:23:12.379 --> 00:23:22.948
But they didn't much think of them, and they started working out
 a new method of capturing the whole world,

00:23:23.097 --> 00:23:31.711
 because, then the idea of power came into their heads;
 that with money we can purchase everything.

00:23:32.281 --> 00:23:37.519
We can make everybody dance to our tune if we have money.

00:23:37.767 --> 00:23:50.036
All this attitude towards money
and human beings was absolutely satanic -

00:23:50.183 --> 00:23:56.249
to such an extent that their own country started getting ruined.

00:23:56.707 --> 00:23:59.558
What happened to the family system?

00:23:59.823 --> 00:24:01.471
What has happened?

00:24:01.576 --> 00:24:03.231
Why the family got ruined?

00:24:03.256 --> 00:24:08.457
Because of the wrong ideas about Lakshmi principle.

00:24:08.575 --> 00:24:13.118
The women got lots of money out of divorce.

00:24:13.316 --> 00:24:19.548
So I've met one lady, she had divorced
her husband eight times, from this country,

00:24:19.634 --> 00:24:23.902
now I'm told she has divorced the nintandh one.

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:26.463
And she has become very rich.

00:24:26.608 --> 00:24:28.757
But she has no shame.

00:24:28.934 --> 00:24:36.873
And she is telling everybody that "Get a divorce,
 that's the best way, that's the advantage of coming to America."

00:24:37.041 --> 00:24:44.468
So what is the problem that human beings don't have enlightenment.

00:24:44.682 --> 00:24:51.996
And if they get money, and if they are hankering after things,

00:24:52.141 --> 00:24:54.472
they have to go to hell, no doubt about it -

00:24:54.799 --> 00:25:02.140
and do all kinds of things which was never done
 in the history of this world.

00:25:02.443 --> 00:25:06.894
I need not tell you all the absurd nonsensical things they do.

00:25:07.121 --> 00:25:18.510
Then started a negatives force of drug,
drinking and all kinds of things.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:27.489
I mean such blindness, such stupidity, that you can't understand.

00:25:27.634 --> 00:25:36.782
As if their brains were completely curtailed
 by the activity of moneymaking.

00:25:37.133 --> 00:25:45.969
I've seen people choosing their suits
and clothes that when they will die,

00:25:46.046 --> 00:25:49.310
what they are going to wear.

00:25:49.343 --> 00:25:51.667
It sounds funny.

00:25:51.782 --> 00:25:58.826
Even their dog dies they make such elaborate arrangements.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:08.234
They choose even their coffin -
which one they would like to use for burying.

00:26:08.518 --> 00:26:15.064
So with the money a new problem started, was the choice.

00:26:15.198 --> 00:26:17.413
What choice you have.

00:26:17.572 --> 00:26:22.940
And people played with that choice.

00:26:23.859 --> 00:26:31.787
They can befool you and tell you what is the best.

00:26:31.912 --> 00:26:37.973
I don't know why, but moneyed people are mostly idiotic,

00:26:38.368 --> 00:26:44.074
 if not very immoral. Idiotic, absolutely idiotic.

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:46.581
Anybody can [INAUDIBLE] befool them.

00:26:46.923 --> 00:26:55.662
So, God knows what is the speciality that the people
 who are very rich can be very cunning,

00:26:55.785 --> 00:27:04.756
can be very immoral, can be self-destroying;
but mostly they are idiotic people.

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:14.704
Because the way they talk, you don't know where to look;
what they say about things you don't understand.

00:27:14.963 --> 00:27:20.450
So then it's become the country of idiots and stupid people,

00:27:20.538 --> 00:27:22.942
and you don't know how to deal with them

00:27:23.004 --> 00:27:30.525
and how to talk to them about, about the higher life.

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:38.429
This Lakshmitattwa has to become a much bigger principle,

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:56.428
which we call as the 'emancipated personality'.

00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:03.290
Or we can say 'person endowed with Mahalakshmi principle'.

00:28:06.298 --> 00:28:12.488
Such a person may be cheated by others, may be troubled by others,

00:28:12.642 --> 00:28:20.675
but such a person has its own inner power
 to overcome all such hurdles.

00:28:21.182 --> 00:28:30.188
So this Mahalakshmi principle should be established:
but one would say "Why?

00:28:30.965 --> 00:28:36.899
What is the advantage of having Mahalakshmi principle?"

00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:55.025
When the Mahalakshmi principle comes,
 then there are nine Lakshmis which are described,

00:28:55.050 --> 00:29:02.921
navadha, nine, which get completely manifested in a human being.

00:29:03.413 --> 00:29:07.374
One of them as we call as Gruhalakshmi.

00:29:07.567 --> 00:29:10.846
Gruhalakshmi means the family.

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:18.163
The wife becomes a very wonderful person.

00:29:18.335 --> 00:29:23.508
She doesn't object to things, she doesn't react,

00:29:23.652 --> 00:29:32.271
 but she is very sensible and she builds  up
all her children in a beautiful manner.

00:29:32.586 --> 00:29:39.276
On the contrary, where she is not a Gruhalakshmi

00:29:39.363 --> 00:29:46.477
she takes pride in working out something like men.

00:29:46.783 --> 00:29:55.288
Means to her, her job is important, her bank balance is important.

00:29:55.522 --> 00:30:04.845
But the real bank balance of a Gruhalakshmi
is her family and her children.

00:30:05.354 --> 00:30:11.109
If she doesn't have that, she will be just

00:30:11.205 --> 00:30:17.378
thinking that she is very great,
she can complete with this man or that man.

00:30:19.605 --> 00:30:25.746
Women don't understand that their greatest capacity is to love.

00:30:26.323 --> 00:30:34.040
How is it that Lakshmi is a woman and all the Goddesses are women?

00:30:34.294 --> 00:30:39.910
And what is the quality of these Goddesses

00:30:40.037 --> 00:30:48.454
 is to bestow blessings on people of their own nature,
of their own qualities.

00:30:50.617 --> 00:30:59.346
So to think that we are better off than men
because we have more money is the greatest idiocity.

00:31:00.303 --> 00:31:07.362
You may have money, but your children will be ruined,
your family will be ruined.

00:31:07.552 --> 00:31:17.645
When you make a good family, then you create a beautiful,
very beautiful, universe around;

00:31:17.772 --> 00:31:26.513
and universes after universes like this can create
a beautiful universe in the whole world.

00:31:27.073 --> 00:31:31.573
There's nothing to sacrifice, but to enjoy everything.

00:31:31.692 --> 00:31:40.123
As I said, you enjoy your hospitality,

00:31:40.388 --> 00:31:51.848
 you enjoy your generosity - which you do not
 feel is a misery or a trouble to you -

00:31:52.172 --> 00:31:55.124
but you just enjoy.

00:31:55.271 --> 00:31:58.010
At least I enjoy.

00:31:58.268 --> 00:32:03.642
If I can give something to someone, that's the greatest blessing.

00:32:04.207 --> 00:32:12.295
So the idiotic people, they believe that generosity is stupidity,

00:32:12.431 --> 00:32:16.306
while they are the real stupidity.

00:32:16.455 --> 00:32:26.063
So to create a proper home for your children is a very great work today,

00:32:26.189 --> 00:32:28.765
 and it has to be done.

00:32:29.652 --> 00:32:34.149
Again there, selfishness comes.

00:32:34.709 --> 00:32:41.499
Human beings have so many, such hurdles in life because,

00:32:41.804 --> 00:32:47.121
I don't know why, he doesn't enjoy everything.

00:32:48.059 --> 00:32:55.538
So the selfishness comes in and they will only love their own children,

00:32:55.652 --> 00:32:58.619
 they will only love their own husbands,

00:32:58.807 --> 00:33:03.067
 or they will love only their own wives.

00:33:03.205 --> 00:33:05.763
This doesn't create a good family.

00:33:05.858 --> 00:33:09.736
I am talking about the global family.

00:33:09.853 --> 00:33:19.377
For us everybody is a realized soul
and their family and our family is one.

00:33:19.615 --> 00:33:24.439
But then they will create problems, talk ill, gossip.

00:33:24.543 --> 00:33:32.150
I am surprised even in Sahaja Yoga
we have many women who just go on gossiping,

00:33:32.364 --> 00:33:34.674
 their style was gossiping.

00:33:34.737 --> 00:33:42.112
Because I am talking about Lakshmi and Mahalakshmi
I have to warn the women

00:33:42.159 --> 00:33:53.458
because they are the ones who will create the great principles,
the great symbols of Lakshmi and Mahalakshmi.

00:33:53.889 --> 00:34:00.363
So gossiping is a very common disease even today in Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:00.773 --> 00:34:05.913
I've seen then [SOUNDS LIKE while inside],
 five or six Sahaja Yoginis meet,

00:34:06.046 --> 00:34:08.353
they go on talking, talking, talking -

00:34:08.378 --> 00:34:12.424
I don't know what do they talk - never about Sahaja Yoga, never.

00:34:12.462 --> 00:34:19.058
What they talk is 'what's wrong with another person',
 'who is a wrong type of a person'

00:34:19.111 --> 00:34:21.316
- that we call 'gossip'.

00:34:21.341 --> 00:34:27.354
And this gossip has created big problems for us in the collective.

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:30.990
So best thing I would advise to keep quiet.

00:34:31.015 --> 00:34:34.159
Even when they come to my house they talk.

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:38.612
They have no sense that they should keep quiet.

00:34:38.999 --> 00:34:45.500
Without quietude you cannot enjoy the cool vibrations of the Divine.

00:34:46.251 --> 00:34:57.304
Just go on gossiping and talking is not a sign
of very developed people in Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:57.553 --> 00:35:04.771
That's why the first thing is that women
 should become much more compassionate,

00:35:04.796 --> 00:35:09.702
much more tolerant and enjoyable.

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:13.771
Because you meet somebody, they will start immediately telling you,

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:17.702
 "That is wrong with this person, this is wrong with that person..."

00:35:17.727 --> 00:35:19.837
But there's no need.

00:35:19.992 --> 00:35:23.836
But they will only come and give you bad news - all kinds.

00:35:23.879 --> 00:35:29.998
But they enjoy, giving the bad news,
that they think they are very important.

00:35:30.458 --> 00:35:38.651
And when they think they are important,
they can be very dangerous people, very dangerous.

00:35:41.115 --> 00:35:48.443
 Because I think it's the women who have to work
 it out much more than men,

00:35:49.125 --> 00:35:52.527
 to understand the value of Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:52.982 --> 00:35:56.825
Because their own children are concerned,

00:35:56.970 --> 00:36:01.657
their family is one of the units of Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:06.091
I am saying this because now I have been noticing it very common,

00:36:06.124 --> 00:36:15.843
 that the women in Sahaja Yoga are not up to the point
 as they should have been.

00:36:16.384 --> 00:36:18.522
They gossip too much.

00:36:18.711 --> 00:36:24.527
So they should take to mauna I think,
take to complete silence, not talk.

00:36:24.908 --> 00:36:35.048
Those who are really very much effective,
who are doing the great work, are always quiet.

00:36:35.198 --> 00:36:36.711
They don't talk.

00:36:36.756 --> 00:36:41.949
I have seen they don't even come and see me, just recede back,

00:36:42.383 --> 00:36:50.593
while the women who think they are something special -
 they are the most dangerous.

00:36:50.625 --> 00:37:03.431
So the power of Lakshmi that actually first falls
on the shoulder of women should be Mahalakshmi's.

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:19.072
And this one is, is a challenge to all the Sahaja Yoginis
to behave themselves,

00:37:19.435 --> 00:37:25.738
and to become greater women than all the
 rest of the women of the world.

00:37:25.876 --> 00:37:31.043
We have some very, very good, very great Sahaja Yoginis, no doubt.

00:37:31.068 --> 00:37:38.462
But their style is different,
and they are working out things in such a manner

00:37:38.487 --> 00:37:41.630
 that it's absolutely adorable.

00:37:41.836 --> 00:37:44.860
They are just working for Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:44.954 --> 00:37:51.589
They do not bother about their personal relationships,
or their personal eminence,

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:56.580
they just want to help Sahaja Yoga in every way.

00:37:57.819 --> 00:38:02.218
Then there is another Lakshmi called as Gajalakshmi.

00:38:02.573 --> 00:38:05.769
Actually it means Gaja means elephant.

00:38:06.145 --> 00:38:12.798
What is the quality of an elephant is that
the elephant walks with a certain gait,

00:38:13.137 --> 00:38:16.615
which is the movement on both the sides.

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:25.882
As I've said you, I've seen people, especially women,
who walk like horses, really -

00:38:26.215 --> 00:38:28.298
they just walk like horses.

00:38:28.323 --> 00:38:39.142
So once a dance teacher told me,
"Should I start, Mother, a dance school?"

00:38:39.378 --> 00:38:42.758
I said, "Better start a dance school, doesn't matter.

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:48.720
But are you sure you can teach them to dance
 or they will be just galloping?"

00:38:48.862 --> 00:38:50.219
"Why?"

00:38:50.305 --> 00:38:56.164
"Because what I've seen of women here that
they walk like horses, I must say.

00:38:56.327 --> 00:39:03.529
How can these women who walk like horses can
[laughs] can do dance, Indian dance specially.

00:39:03.554 --> 00:39:05.156
It's very difficult."

00:39:05.237 --> 00:39:11.493
So, now we have to see what is the gait, how you walk.

00:39:12.398 --> 00:39:18.332
Do you walk like an elephant, or you walk like a horse?

00:39:18.478 --> 00:39:24.613
Especially for men, men should not walk like elephant
but should walk like horses, all right.

00:39:28.969 --> 00:39:34.290
But the worst thing that has happened is that men dress up like women

00:39:34.315 --> 00:39:36.428
and women dress up like man.

00:39:36.453 --> 00:39:38.087
Now what to do?

00:39:38.112 --> 00:39:45.459
Why this kind of a mad transformation taking place?

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:49.210
Why do they take to such things?

00:39:49.252 --> 00:40:02.136
For, what is the advantage of becoming a woman
when he is a man, and a woman becoming a man?

00:40:02.172 --> 00:40:08.232
That is the reason, it which shows, that they
want to have some change -

00:40:08.257 --> 00:40:10.162
 some change is important.

00:40:10.452 --> 00:40:14.542
You'd like to change your dress,
you'd like to change your houses,

00:40:14.565 --> 00:40:17.377
even your sexes you want to change.

00:40:17.402 --> 00:40:26.399
But why not change your complete being through self-realization.

00:40:27.119 --> 00:40:32.249
That is very important, to understand that
we are transformed,

00:40:32.368 --> 00:40:38.034
and we must have our own dignity of Sahaja Yoga -

00:40:38.423 --> 00:40:46.584
 the way we behave, the way we move about and work.

00:40:47.818 --> 00:40:55.206
My experience is that once they come to Sahaja Yoga, mostly,

00:40:55.231 --> 00:41:02.474
they become very, very beautiful people;

00:41:03.036 --> 00:41:12.284
and that gradually start growing like
flowers, fragrant with their compassion and love.

00:41:12.646 --> 00:41:19.088
But also there are people who do not understand how to grow.

00:41:19.606 --> 00:41:25.563
They have their own small circle into which they move,

00:41:25.813 --> 00:41:30.965
and they get just stagnated, they become dwarfed.

00:41:31.126 --> 00:41:36.128
And then such Sahaja Yogis have to leave Sahaja
Yoga.

00:41:36.588 --> 00:41:46.522
So it is the responsibility of all the Sahaja
Yogis to watch and see how far their mind is working.

00:41:47.378 --> 00:41:49.433
Where are they going?

00:41:49.487 --> 00:41:51.512
What are they doing?

00:41:51.553 --> 00:42:00.755
How are they achieving their status as Sahaja Yogis?

00:42:01.949 --> 00:42:15.107
So these Lakshmi and, Lakshmis I would say,
and also the Lakshmipatis in Sahaja Yoga have

00:42:15.185 --> 00:42:20.992
to be very different than the other people
who have money.

00:42:23.306 --> 00:42:34.736
Mahalakshmi principle should give you a very sober,
 balanced, affectionate and loving temperament.

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:40.732
If it doesn't give you, then you should know
there's something missing.

00:42:40.876 --> 00:42:47.487
After all, you have come to Sahaja Yoga
not for anything else but for your growth.

00:42:47.789 --> 00:42:58.415
And to keep that growth on, you have to acquire
a sense of understanding what should be your,

00:42:58.488 --> 00:43:08.793
your personality - relative to others, relative
to other people who are still seeking,

00:43:08.857 --> 00:43:16.911
who are still blind, we have to achieve a global emancipation.

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:22.286
I know that's my vision is, and the other day we were counting

00:43:22.334 --> 00:43:25.285
 how many projects have started.

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:28.042
So, we had to stop at 35.

00:43:28.138 --> 00:43:37.133
Already 35 projects have started in India, also in other countries,

00:43:37.603 --> 00:43:45.022
and they are only for emancipating human beings.

00:43:46.508 --> 00:43:54.793
But firstly, as I told you, to do work in
Sahaja Yoga you have to be a detached person.

00:43:55.024 --> 00:44:02.292
That is the quality of a Mahalakshmi principle,
that such a person is detached.

00:44:03.144 --> 00:44:07.475
He is not attached to things which are worthless.

00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:13.149
But that doesn't mean that you take a sanyasa
and run away from the family,

00:44:13.174 --> 00:44:17.233
run away from your household, run away from ...

00:44:17.353 --> 00:44:20.836
 that's not detachment, that's running away.

00:44:21.128 --> 00:44:28.309
But detachment is that when you have everything,
still you are detached:

00:44:28.366 --> 00:44:37.163
 in the sense you do not feel concerned
 about your own gain out of this.

00:44:38.343 --> 00:44:47.438
Such things can happen, very easily, if you really introspect.

00:44:47.811 --> 00:44:52.806
And introspection is the best way of meditation.

00:44:53.049 --> 00:44:59.052
First introspect and then meditate, then you will grow.

00:44:59.088 --> 00:45:08.508
And the real joy of yourself, of your Spirit,
will really give you such enjoyment

00:45:08.613 --> 00:45:13.936
that you will not take to stupid, insignificant things.

00:45:13.961 --> 00:45:21.870
But you will become very significant people
in Sahaja Yoga who will do such wonderful work

00:45:22.032 --> 00:45:28.509
 that everybody will be amazed that an
ordinary human being,

00:45:28.534 --> 00:45:33.612
 how can he achieve such things, how can he work it out?

00:45:33.692 --> 00:45:39.781
As I've told you before, that after realization
you become extremely creative -

00:45:39.912 --> 00:45:45.742
 creative in everything, specially in giving realization
to others,

00:45:45.885 --> 00:45:53.965
and also creating creative in your life of art,

00:45:53.990 --> 00:46:00.129
 music, poetry, drama, writing - all kinds of things you do.

00:46:00.367 --> 00:46:04.153
We have seen now so many cases who have never been

00:46:04.178 --> 00:46:11.564
 on the stage, even, have given very great, inspiring lectures.

00:46:11.716 --> 00:46:16.588
So the creativity comes like an inspiration for others.

00:46:16.709 --> 00:46:19.180
They see you and they feel inspired.

00:46:19.468 --> 00:46:23.759
You are not the one who goes into the shadow and sits back.

00:46:23.799 --> 00:46:25.901
But openly you come out.

00:46:25.926 --> 00:46:35.291
With no pride or no sort of aggression, but
complete humility;

00:46:35.397 --> 00:46:39.561
 and you give such beautiful feelings to others,

00:46:39.586 --> 00:46:44.591
such understanding about yourself and about the other

00:46:44.616 --> 00:46:47.265
through yourcollective consciousness.

00:46:47.387 --> 00:46:53.766
See about collective consciousness and other
things, so many people have talked.

00:46:53.791 --> 00:46:58.525
The other day you saw it, there were so many people like Jung

00:46:58.630 --> 00:47:07.239
and also there were other scientists and also other philosophers who
have talked about it.

00:47:07.264 --> 00:47:12.674
But you have got it, you have the experience
of collective consciousness.

00:47:12.812 --> 00:47:18.935
Despite that, if you are lagging behind

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:23.711
in your progress of Sahaja Yoga, in Sahaja Yoga,
that means there is something wrong.

00:47:23.736 --> 00:47:27.679
Some sort of a load you are carrying on your head.

00:47:27.822 --> 00:47:33.013
But through our attachments, there could be loads on your head.

00:47:33.246 --> 00:47:39.502
In Sahaja Yoga you are involved with everything and you are detached.

00:47:39.689 --> 00:47:45.266
And such a miracle happens to you which
you know very well, I don't have to describe it.

00:47:45.706 --> 00:47:51.636
So a new personality with a Mahalakshmi principle comes in.

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:56.865
Mahalakshmi principle is the one which takes you to your seeking

00:47:56.913 --> 00:48:00.553
and when you have found out the reality,  the truth,

00:48:00.874 --> 00:48:02.890
 then you progress.

00:48:02.915 --> 00:48:08.059
With Mahalakshmi principle only, you get your
realization.

00:48:08.084 --> 00:48:13.780
You know that very well, that through the
Mahalakshmi channel only you rise,

00:48:13.805 --> 00:48:16.467
and you get your realization.

00:48:16.610 --> 00:48:27.410
So to become a great Sahaja Yogi,
 you have to look after your Mahalakshmi principle.

00:48:27.435 --> 00:48:33.025
Now there are people I have seen who care for cheap popularity.

00:48:34.008 --> 00:48:38.014
I have known people who will do everything
for others,

00:48:38.039 --> 00:48:41.437
do this, do that, but only for popularity.

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:49.379
There's no - essentially understood - they
have not essentially understood that

00:48:49.404 --> 00:48:53.397
 whatever you are doing, is it for cheap popularity?

00:48:53.872 --> 00:48:57.501
You don't have to fight an election in Sahaja Yoga,

00:48:57.599 --> 00:49:00.676
you don't have to cast your votes in an election.

00:49:00.701 --> 00:49:07.668
But what happens daily, the person who has
that dynamism of Sahaja Yoga

00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:11.058
 just comes up. Everybody knows.

00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:21.468
Not talking, not impressing, not showing off,
not going after cheap popularity,

00:49:21.493 --> 00:49:28.018
 but growing within - for that I cannot say what you have to do.

00:49:28.043 --> 00:49:31.210
How does a tree grow? By itself.

00:49:31.309 --> 00:49:35.022
You are living examples of Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:35.198 --> 00:49:38.308
So how will you grow by yourself?

00:49:38.492 --> 00:49:44.955
By yourself you'll grow - is a promise that
is given to you by the Divine.

00:49:45.066 --> 00:49:52.414
But allow it to grow, through introspection and meditation,

00:49:52.797 --> 00:49:58.858
 and what we call complete dedication and devotion.

00:49:58.924 --> 00:50:07.317
The other day I told you about the word shraddha
- it's not just praying, it's not just having faith,

00:50:07.448 --> 00:50:13.285
but shraddha is that you have it in your heart -

00:50:13.381 --> 00:50:20.835
the enjoyment of achievement through your devotion and dedication,

00:50:20.932 --> 00:50:24.061
 that should be called as shraddha.

00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:27.575
With that thing only it will work out.

00:50:27.734 --> 00:50:32.752
But you have to have faith in yourself and
faith in Sahaja Yoga.

00:50:32.884 --> 00:50:38.020
You know you have got it, those people were
talking about it, but you have got it -

00:50:38.025 --> 00:50:40.536
 you know what is collective consciousness.

00:50:40.619 --> 00:50:43.475
You know that you are in the collective consciousness.

00:50:43.559 --> 00:50:47.698
But how far you have grown into it is to be seen.

00:50:47.723 --> 00:50:49.284
It's very important.

00:50:49.308 --> 00:50:56.061
For that, I need not in this short time describe
to you all the qualities of the Lakshmi but

00:50:56.085 --> 00:51:05.872
try to understand that a person who has Lakshmi
principle has to have all these special qualities

00:51:05.896 --> 00:51:10.438
otherwise he is not the worshiper of Lakshmi.

00:51:11.366 --> 00:51:16.838
And that's how I would today bless you all with the proper wisdom

00:51:16.863 --> 00:51:20.697
and the proper understanding of the Lakshmi principle

00:51:20.764 --> 00:51:24.488
 through the lights which are enlightened within your heart.

00:51:24.512 --> 00:51:26.092
May God Bless You.

00:51:34.383 --> 00:51:37.404
May God Bless You.
