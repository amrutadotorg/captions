00:04:40.545 --> 00:04:51.525
Today, we are going to worship Shri Krishna.

00:04:51.525 --> 00:04:57.655
See how cold it was about three o'clock.

00:04:57.655 --> 00:05:08.645
Now the reason is this, that Shri Krishna
did little mischief with Indra.

00:05:08.645 --> 00:05:18.604
Indra, who is a God, or you can call semi-God,
for looking after the rain.

00:05:18.604 --> 00:05:24.085
So, Indra got very angry.

00:05:24.085 --> 00:05:36.494
You see all such semi-Gods are very sensitive
people, at the smallest thing they get angry

00:05:36.494 --> 00:05:46.535
and irritated and they start using their powers
to express their anger.

00:05:46.535 --> 00:05:58.655
So he started pouring rain on all the gopas
and Shri Krishna, who were looking after the

00:05:58.655 --> 00:06:06.365
cows.

00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:17.115
And the rain was so heavy that they thought
that the whole land will be completely submerged.

00:06:17.115 --> 00:06:48.685
So Indra was very happy to spoil the game
of Shri Krishna, and he thought he was very

00:06:48.685 --> 00:06:50.615
successful.

00:06:50.615 --> 00:07:08.615
So, Shri Krishna lifted a mountain on His
finger, and all these people who were getting

00:07:08.615 --> 00:07:12.095
drowned, went under that mountain.

00:07:12.095 --> 00:07:19.975
This is Shri Krishna's style.

00:07:19.975 --> 00:07:24.835
My style is different.

00:07:24.835 --> 00:07:31.405
I told Indra that you can't misbehave with
me, you can't.

00:07:31.405 --> 00:07:41.205
So far I'm not harmed you in any way and
I'm not irritated you.

00:07:41.205 --> 00:07:50.445
Of course it's going to be Shri Krishna's
Puja, but that doesn't mean that you should

00:07:50.445 --> 00:07:56.625
try to show off your powers before me.

00:07:56.625 --> 00:08:04.825
Sometimes I wonder these Devas - Semi-Gods,
they are realized souls or not, because why

00:08:04.825 --> 00:08:10.825
do they get angry like this for small things.

00:08:10.825 --> 00:08:21.665
Whatever it is, he could be reconciled and
now it's become warm, I must say.

00:08:21.665 --> 00:08:38.285
With Sahaja Yoga you can do many many things,
but you must know what you can do.

00:08:38.285 --> 00:08:52.085
For that, Krishna is a very good example.

00:08:52.085 --> 00:08:54.484
He started Sahaj culture.

00:08:54.484 --> 00:09:06.735
Culture, I'm saying - He didn't give realization
to anyone, but He gave the idea of Sahaj culture.

00:09:06.735 --> 00:09:08.825
How?

00:09:08.825 --> 00:09:23.685
- Before him came Shri Ram, who was Maryada
Purushotama, who was a man very particular

00:09:23.685 --> 00:09:26.765
about everything.

00:09:26.765 --> 00:09:36.605
I mean, like He threw out His wife because
He was a king and a king cannot have a scandal,

00:09:36.605 --> 00:09:39.414
especially from His wife.

00:09:39.414 --> 00:09:46.795
So He threw Her out - it was not Kali Yuga,
that's why.

00:09:46.795 --> 00:10:00.145
And His father ordered him to go, not only
His father so much as His stepmother, to go

00:10:00.145 --> 00:10:04.804
in an exile into a forest.

00:10:04.804 --> 00:10:13.135
So He agreed, after all He was Maryada Purushotama.

00:10:13.135 --> 00:10:21.615
So whatever His father said, He agreed, whatever
His mother said, He agreed, and went into

00:10:21.615 --> 00:10:27.835
the forest, stayed there fourteen years.

00:10:27.835 --> 00:10:32.805
This is the obedience to the father.

00:10:32.805 --> 00:10:37.084
There was no need, His father was not God.

00:10:37.084 --> 00:10:52.084
He was God, but in those days it was important
to make people, not only respect the parents

00:10:52.084 --> 00:11:00.474
but also to obey them, that was the time.

00:11:00.474 --> 00:11:12.615
In His time there were many munis, and many
saints and many also hatha yogis.

00:11:12.615 --> 00:11:25.344
And these, even before him, used to make people
practice very strict type of discipline and

00:11:25.344 --> 00:11:35.904
if they did not practice the discipline, they
had to do a lot of penance.

00:11:35.904 --> 00:11:44.784
And, so many people who tried also, never
reached the goal, because of the strictness

00:11:44.784 --> 00:12:01.075
and complete discipline about following the
path of spirituality.

00:12:01.075 --> 00:12:05.135
Recently I was reading a book called "Peaceful
Warrior".

00:12:05.135 --> 00:12:14.735
There they have described an American seeking
the truth, and the guru of that fellow really

00:12:14.735 --> 00:12:23.414
really takes him to such a horrible severe
task - that my granddaughter said, I am very

00:12:23.414 --> 00:12:27.784
angry with such a Guru, she couldn't bear
it.

00:12:27.784 --> 00:12:36.175
So ultimately he finds that he is the existence.

00:12:36.175 --> 00:12:42.425
So that was the practice followed after Shri
Rama.

00:12:42.425 --> 00:12:53.015
People would leave their wives, children,
go to Himalayas and sit there and practice

00:12:53.015 --> 00:12:55.985
meditation.

00:12:55.985 --> 00:13:12.975
It was a very rigorously followed, or I should
say, a very moral society - so very moral.

00:13:12.975 --> 00:13:24.625
But it was out of fear, the whole morality
came through fear, which is also repeated

00:13:24.625 --> 00:13:25.625
in other religions.

00:13:25.625 --> 00:13:32.375
Now I would say that Islam today, has taken
that form, it is the fear.

00:13:32.375 --> 00:13:38.585
They are not doing it out of freedom.

00:13:38.585 --> 00:13:47.105
Also Christians, same thing, and Hindus - I
don't know - halfway this side, and half way

00:13:47.105 --> 00:13:53.575
that side.

00:13:53.575 --> 00:13:59.835
Even among Sikhs there's terrible disciplining.

00:13:59.835 --> 00:14:06.905
So much so that, as punishment you have to
clean the shoes of all the people.

00:14:06.905 --> 00:14:10.655
I don't know if it is to beat yourself with
shoes or another.

00:14:10.655 --> 00:14:17.465
But quite a lot of punishment is there.

00:14:17.465 --> 00:14:31.535
Then came Shri Krishna and He saw the situation
- that the way people are really now fasting.

00:14:31.535 --> 00:14:43.715
If you really go through the rituals of Hindu
religion, out of one week, you will be fasting

00:14:43.715 --> 00:14:46.765
for six days at least.

00:14:46.765 --> 00:14:55.525
One day you might eat some sort of a food,
then you'll have to visit all kinds of places.

00:14:55.525 --> 00:15:05.535
Now, recently they had to go, as you know,
to Amarnath, and so many died there.

00:15:05.535 --> 00:15:13.735
So now they said "we have got Nirvana, we
died while doing this, so we have got Nirvana".

00:15:13.735 --> 00:15:20.665
This kind of a very funny idea was existing.

00:15:20.665 --> 00:15:29.185
That we have Nirvana now, we have achieved
whatever we wanted and now we are dead, so

00:15:29.185 --> 00:15:34.045
many are dead, so those who were not dead
were repenting why they were not dead - it

00:15:34.045 --> 00:15:39.875
would have been much better, they would have
got their Nirvana.

00:15:39.875 --> 00:15:51.195
So, even in this Kali Yuga these ideas are
prevalent.

00:15:51.195 --> 00:16:00.095
Even in India, people have very severe types,
especially in south I have seen, they do all

00:16:00.095 --> 00:16:10.505
kinds of nonsense for the atonement or maybe
for something they are asking.

00:16:10.505 --> 00:16:16.375
All this nonsense was too much for Shri Krishna.

00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:23.625
He couldn't understand that they are going
to destroy their lives with this kind of ritualistic

00:16:23.625 --> 00:16:30.505
gruelling, then what will remain out of them
for Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:30.505 --> 00:16:33.255
So He's the one who started Sahaj culture.

00:16:33.255 --> 00:16:48.805
He said "let us enjoy, we must have enjoyment,
Nirmala Anand - pure joy".

00:16:48.805 --> 00:16:53.615
How do we have pure joy by?

00:16:53.615 --> 00:17:04.495
- He had this rakhi bandhan by which, apart
from your wife, everybody is your sister or

00:17:04.495 --> 00:17:05.495
mother.

00:17:05.495 --> 00:17:08.595
I must say it is quite true about Indians.

00:17:08.595 --> 00:17:14.365
Not in the north so much because of Islamic
influence, but in the south it is so.

00:17:14.365 --> 00:17:18.545
In Maharastra it is so.

00:17:18.545 --> 00:17:30.125
And then He started also this Holi, in which
you should play with colors, maybe to get

00:17:30.125 --> 00:17:33.585
rid of the color barriers we have, maybe.

00:17:33.585 --> 00:17:40.915
In America it is a very good idea to play
with colors and put some black on the whites

00:17:40.915 --> 00:17:48.115
and some whites on the black and they can
see for themselves how stupid it is to fight

00:17:48.115 --> 00:17:56.015
in the name of color.

00:17:56.015 --> 00:18:07.655
He used to play with children who were looking
after cows, just like a very ordinary person.

00:18:07.655 --> 00:18:12.195
He never tried to show off His powers.

00:18:12.195 --> 00:18:22.195
He never tried to stand out, never would dress
up in a very special way, never.

00:18:22.195 --> 00:18:28.015
Just like an out ordinary cowherd.

00:18:28.015 --> 00:18:35.405
And His relationship with His mother, Yeshoda
- she was not His mother - was also extremely

00:18:35.405 --> 00:18:37.335
beautiful.

00:18:37.335 --> 00:18:46.965
There are so many beautiful poems written
about His childhood.

00:18:46.965 --> 00:18:54.545
That, He's the one who is in charge of the
whole universe.

00:18:54.545 --> 00:19:04.835
As a little boy used to put His finger into
His mouth wondering - how can a Divine Virata

00:19:04.835 --> 00:19:13.745
do that?

00:19:13.745 --> 00:19:16.095
What is His thinking like a child?

00:19:16.095 --> 00:19:18.215
All His actions of children.

00:19:18.215 --> 00:19:22.035
Yesterday's song, as you heard it, is this.

00:19:22.035 --> 00:19:26.495
All these little, little actions are described
very well.

00:19:26.495 --> 00:19:31.065
Especially by another very great poet, Surdas,
who was blind.

00:19:31.065 --> 00:19:40.585
His childhood is described in a very beautiful
manner and the description of His relationship

00:19:40.585 --> 00:19:47.455
with His mother is very natural and very sweet.

00:19:47.455 --> 00:19:52.535
It was not like this, as modern times, a carpet
is spoiled, "Oh, the carpet you have spoiled

00:19:52.535 --> 00:19:57.155
it, I'll hit you hard, this carpet you have
spoiled".

00:19:57.155 --> 00:20:04.225
They have more interest in their things than
in their own children.

00:20:04.225 --> 00:20:12.025
But according to our culture, if the child
breaks anything, you have to say this "very

00:20:12.025 --> 00:20:15.085
good you have broken, some badha has gone
away".

00:20:15.085 --> 00:20:24.625
Never to scold a child for doing anything
which you think is destructive - because then

00:20:24.625 --> 00:20:29.095
he will definitely become destructive.

00:20:29.095 --> 00:20:34.335
So to understand a child, I think you must
read those poems, beautiful poems, which are

00:20:34.335 --> 00:20:38.365
written about Shri Krishna.

00:20:38.365 --> 00:20:49.435
I don't know how their imagination reached
that beautiful height of pure joy.

00:20:49.435 --> 00:21:01.185
So towards our children also, we have to be
extremely sweet and nice and forgiving.

00:21:01.185 --> 00:21:08.615
But some children, of course, I meet are difficult,
but they also can be corrected if you really

00:21:08.615 --> 00:21:12.015
apply Shri Krishna's methods to him.

00:21:12.015 --> 00:21:24.715
Now when He went to college, or we can say
in to the school of a Sandipanimuni, the guru.

00:21:24.715 --> 00:21:30.145
The guru's wife was very kind.

00:21:30.145 --> 00:21:34.905
But the guru was strict.

00:21:34.905 --> 00:21:45.245
And his wife used to look after him and when
she gave him something for food when they

00:21:45.245 --> 00:21:52.405
would go and bring some woods from the forest.

00:21:52.405 --> 00:21:57.615
It is very subtle, you know the whole thing
is.

00:21:57.615 --> 00:22:05.895
He went there and His friend was carrying
the food.

00:22:05.895 --> 00:22:13.095
His friend was carrying the food and Shri
Krishna was busy cutting the wood, imagine?

00:22:13.095 --> 00:22:20.685
Shri Krishna was cutting the wood for the
mother.

00:22:20.685 --> 00:22:26.925
I mean, for the mother He could do anything,
He was God.

00:22:26.925 --> 00:22:36.965
So no work for the mother was menial or lower.

00:22:36.965 --> 00:22:48.655
But the other fellow, the friend of His, he
was very hungry, so he ate all the food and

00:22:48.655 --> 00:22:51.385
nothing was left.

00:22:51.385 --> 00:22:56.705
So when he came down, he got very much worried.

00:22:56.705 --> 00:23:04.735
He went and told his guru that "I ate all
the food and I didn't share it with Shri Krishna".

00:23:04.735 --> 00:23:15.605
The guru got very angry, very angry and he
said "now, you will be cursed with permanent

00:23:15.605 --> 00:23:16.605
poverty".

00:23:16.605 --> 00:23:28.775
But the mother said "no, not permanent - till
you meet Shri Krishna again".

00:23:28.775 --> 00:23:36.905
That's how she tried to give, we call it Upashad,
in that you give another curse, which can

00:23:36.905 --> 00:23:40.895
neutralize partly.

00:23:40.895 --> 00:23:50.665
The same friend, was Sudama, and he was very
very poor.

00:23:50.665 --> 00:24:00.735
Now see the Sahaj ways of Shri Krishna, He
always used to remember Sudama and He told

00:24:00.735 --> 00:24:08.235
His wife that I really I don't know, he's
cursed, I don't know what must be his condition,

00:24:08.235 --> 00:24:09.675
where he must be?

00:24:09.675 --> 00:24:19.915
Now the friendship - He was a king, such intimacy
of feeling with a friend.

00:24:19.915 --> 00:24:23.395
He said "I used to go with him, I used to
collect the woods.

00:24:23.395 --> 00:24:29.275
I mean, imagine all these little, little things
had such a big importance for him.

00:24:29.275 --> 00:24:36.365
So, He was not only worried about the whole
world, as He should have been, but also about

00:24:36.365 --> 00:24:39.665
Sudama - When will I meet him?

00:24:39.665 --> 00:24:42.595
When will I see him again?

00:24:42.595 --> 00:24:47.454
Where must be his house?

00:24:47.454 --> 00:24:48.975
How he must be living?

00:24:48.975 --> 00:24:59.045
All these very delicate feelings He had for
His friend.

00:24:59.045 --> 00:25:04.355
Just like a Sahaja Yogi.

00:25:04.355 --> 00:25:14.765
In the Sahaja style, we worry about the whole
world and also individually we are worried.

00:25:14.765 --> 00:25:26.595
We come to know about one person who has fallen
sick, who has a problem, something is serious.

00:25:26.595 --> 00:25:38.865
All the Sahaja Yogis think of him and are
worried about him, they may have everything,

00:25:38.865 --> 00:25:44.865
but still they are worried, what is happening
to such and such person.

00:25:44.865 --> 00:25:55.675
How many of us know each other's names - I
mean He knows everybody's name - practically.

00:25:55.675 --> 00:26:08.575
And how we care for them, how we respect them,
how we love them and how we have pure relationships.

00:26:08.575 --> 00:26:17.605
Today is also the day of Rakshabandhan, which
is a very great thing that we should have

00:26:17.605 --> 00:26:21.115
pure relationships.

00:26:21.115 --> 00:26:32.685
I've seen in, say Maharashtra, men won't go
and talk to women much and women won't go

00:26:32.685 --> 00:26:36.695
and talk to men.

00:26:36.695 --> 00:26:46.615
And once, somebody remarked - "Then what are
you women doing, talking to women only?".

00:26:46.615 --> 00:26:49.785
So, I said what are we to talk to you?

00:26:49.785 --> 00:26:54.695
You are talking about your office, we are
talking about our houses and homes.

00:26:54.695 --> 00:26:58.715
What is there to talk to you?

00:26:58.715 --> 00:27:04.735
The western culture is different, they will
force you.

00:27:04.735 --> 00:27:09.485
They'll make one man sit here and next to
him should be a woman, somebody else's wife,

00:27:09.485 --> 00:27:12.505
then another man and then somebody else's
wife.

00:27:12.505 --> 00:27:19.455
How can you have intimacy?

00:27:19.455 --> 00:27:30.495
This kind of idea, which is A-Sahaj, has slipped
into immorality.

00:27:30.495 --> 00:27:36.505
There's no need for men and women to sit like
that, what is the need, I just don't understand.

00:27:36.505 --> 00:27:39.065
Compulsorily you have to sit.

00:27:39.065 --> 00:27:50.865
I've had a bad time, I tell you, with my husband's
job, I never liked it.

00:27:50.865 --> 00:27:55.695
What is there to talk to these men, after
all, I don't know anything about banking,

00:27:55.695 --> 00:28:00.905
I don't know shares, I don't know stock exchange,
what it is.

00:28:00.905 --> 00:28:06.775
Or I don't know profits, and this and that
- that part is zero.

00:28:06.775 --> 00:28:14.885
Then, I don't know about office, I don't know
many other things men talk about, so what

00:28:14.885 --> 00:28:20.834
is there to talk to them - it is so very difficult.

00:28:20.834 --> 00:28:28.145
And whenever I said something, I really dropped
a brick.

00:28:28.145 --> 00:28:37.125
Once in a party, they were offering drinks
to everyone and this, so I said "I will have

00:28:37.125 --> 00:28:41.325
a soft drink".

00:28:41.325 --> 00:28:43.935
So the valet came and gave me a soft drink.

00:28:43.935 --> 00:28:53.035
The valet was having a bow, and a white shirt,
that's all, absolutely A-Sahaj methods.

00:28:53.035 --> 00:29:02.905
Black bow, white shirt, black coat, black
pant, all just the same - whether it is an

00:29:02.905 --> 00:29:05.665
ambassador or a valet.

00:29:05.665 --> 00:29:08.635
You can't make it out who is who.

00:29:08.635 --> 00:29:31.915
So I drank, you know, and when it was finished
I gave it to an ambassador, a very well known

00:29:31.915 --> 00:29:32.915
ambassador.

00:29:32.915 --> 00:29:38.105
To me there was no difference at all, when
they are just say walking the same way, talking

00:29:38.105 --> 00:29:40.935
the same way.

00:29:40.935 --> 00:29:46.815
So A-Sahaj the whole thing is.

00:29:46.815 --> 00:29:55.245
They say they have so many Embassies, for
what I don't know and there what they have,

00:29:55.245 --> 00:29:59.755
always drinks, parties - shake hands, shake
hands.

00:29:59.755 --> 00:30:04.755
Your hands will break, I tell you.

00:30:04.755 --> 00:30:08.025
Most A-Sahaj method is to shake hands.

00:30:08.025 --> 00:30:14.145
Why not say Namaste, it is better, and you
know me.

00:30:14.145 --> 00:30:17.865
Sometimes I used to get such heat.

00:30:17.865 --> 00:30:22.535
Like yesterday you have shown that the ice
melted.

00:30:22.535 --> 00:30:26.395
The same thing used to happen to me.

00:30:26.395 --> 00:30:31.595
Mostly they were very hot people and I didn't
know what to do, I used to stand on one side

00:30:31.595 --> 00:30:33.735
just feeling shy.

00:30:33.735 --> 00:30:39.835
But this method of hand shaking is absolutely
A-Sahaj.

00:30:39.835 --> 00:30:50.275
And worse than that is French method, is to
kiss, and like it or not - you are kissed.

00:30:50.275 --> 00:30:52.475
Or to hug somebody.

00:30:52.475 --> 00:31:05.035
The first time I gave realization to one English
gentleman, he just lifted me up like that.

00:31:05.035 --> 00:31:18.655
I said " all right - it's just out of joy
he has done it, it's all right".

00:31:18.655 --> 00:31:25.095
But there is no openness, there's no openness
of heart.

00:31:25.095 --> 00:31:31.065
You go to a party, you have to be dressed
up like this only, if you are not dressed

00:31:31.065 --> 00:31:34.345
up like that, then you are useless.

00:31:34.345 --> 00:31:38.445
If you go for a death also.

00:31:38.445 --> 00:31:43.135
Somebody died, a great friend, a nice man.

00:31:43.135 --> 00:31:46.145
So I was told I had to wear a black sari.

00:31:46.145 --> 00:31:51.395
Black blouse, everything black.

00:31:51.395 --> 00:31:56.645
I said, "I have no sari, black without border,
you know".

00:31:56.645 --> 00:32:00.334
So they said "you don't go".

00:32:00.334 --> 00:32:03.795
I said "Very good idea".

00:32:03.795 --> 00:32:07.405
Because I don't know these A-Sahaj methods.

00:32:07.405 --> 00:32:15.935
You are not supposed to cry or weep there,
no, you have to keep quiet.

00:32:15.935 --> 00:32:24.985
Then when you go there, the body is lying
there, and after a prayer is said, you are

00:32:24.985 --> 00:32:27.365
supposed to drink champagne.

00:32:27.365 --> 00:32:37.805
I mean, imagine it, how can you, no feelings,
for that body which is lying there dead.

00:32:37.805 --> 00:32:44.515
And everybody very happy, and if somebody
looked unhappy, they would ask "what's wrong,

00:32:44.515 --> 00:32:47.385
are you all right?".

00:32:47.385 --> 00:32:50.775
No consciousness that we have lost a friend
here.

00:32:50.775 --> 00:32:58.315
This is the A-Sahaj style when it comes to
grief.

00:32:58.315 --> 00:33:13.895
When it comes to joy it is A-Sahaj, when it
comes to grief it is A-Sahaj.

00:33:13.895 --> 00:33:25.395
We have to be Sahaj, in the sense that whatever
we do, we do it spontaneously.

00:33:25.395 --> 00:33:27.745
Not with deliberations.

00:33:27.745 --> 00:33:32.695
We have some very anglicized people in India
also.

00:33:32.695 --> 00:33:44.334
And the lady of the house died
and I went to see - and in India the body

00:33:44.334 --> 00:33:48.975
is taken down on the ground.

00:33:48.975 --> 00:33:55.895
So they were discussing what to do, what time
to start the funeral and all that.

00:33:55.895 --> 00:34:02.355
So one lady, who is a very well known person
in India, she said "you should not do it before

00:34:02.355 --> 00:34:04.125
twelve o'clock".

00:34:04.125 --> 00:34:05.365
I said "why"?

00:34:05.365 --> 00:34:07.595
She said, "Because I'll have to wear white".

00:34:07.595 --> 00:34:09.305
"That's true".

00:34:09.305 --> 00:34:15.585
"And I'll have to go to the bank to get my
diamonds to match with the white sari".

00:34:15.585 --> 00:34:20.815
I said "What is this?"

00:34:20.815 --> 00:34:31.495
Such filth of materialism.

00:34:31.495 --> 00:34:42.334
It is going too far, we are going away from
our feelings, from our emotions, which are

00:34:42.334 --> 00:34:51.265
genuine, which are there all the time, you
don't have to think about them, they exist

00:34:51.265 --> 00:34:54.365
all the time.

00:34:54.365 --> 00:34:59.625
But you think "Now, should I cry or not?

00:34:59.625 --> 00:35:03.095
Should I laugh or not?

00:35:03.095 --> 00:35:07.125
It's so spontaneous.

00:35:07.125 --> 00:35:12.425
If you have joy, you are spontaneous.

00:35:12.425 --> 00:35:18.115
You express your joy spontaneously.

00:35:18.115 --> 00:35:29.065
Of course, not in an uncultured way, but in
a very cultured way.

00:35:29.065 --> 00:35:37.365
Now, what 's the meaning of the Sahaj culture
- this culture, is something that is, you

00:35:37.365 --> 00:35:48.765
are groomed, you are brought up, in a very
natural manner, that you develop a culture.

00:35:48.765 --> 00:36:02.015
A small, like, a child like, simple innocent
behavior.

00:36:02.015 --> 00:36:20.855
It is Shri Krishna's introduction of idea
of pure joy - Nirmala Anand, which came as

00:36:20.855 --> 00:36:31.885
a great relief to Indian people because they
were following Shri Ramachandra.

00:36:31.885 --> 00:36:36.645
But then abandonment started.

00:36:36.645 --> 00:36:50.135
The problem is, if you make them strict, they
become like starched clothes I think, that

00:36:50.135 --> 00:36:55.625
you can't wear them.

00:36:55.625 --> 00:37:01.005
Or if you allow them - no, no, you must enjoy,
you must enjoy, all right, you allow them,

00:37:01.005 --> 00:37:05.345
do what you like.

00:37:05.345 --> 00:37:11.454
If you allow them to do what you like, then
they start doing all kinds of things.

00:37:11.454 --> 00:37:19.115
In India, we had lots of horrible things,
which I dare not even tell you - in the name

00:37:19.115 --> 00:37:20.115
of enjoyment.

00:37:20.115 --> 00:37:30.425
But Shri Krishna Himself has been very much
misrepresented by stupid people like Vidyapati.

00:37:30.425 --> 00:37:38.074
He was a great poet and he used Krishna and
Radha as Romeo and Juliet.

00:37:38.074 --> 00:37:46.355
That's the greatest insult to the purity of
their relationship.

00:37:46.355 --> 00:37:52.334
You must have seen many pictures like that,
in Kangra Shaili, and this shaili, and that

00:37:52.334 --> 00:37:53.334
shaili.

00:37:53.334 --> 00:38:00.405
It's all nonsense.

00:38:00.405 --> 00:38:15.765
They could not show the reality of their relationship,
but some sort of a very vulgar expression.

00:38:15.765 --> 00:38:24.355
Because I think these poets and these artists
at that time had some hidden suppressed feelings

00:38:24.355 --> 00:38:34.225
within themselves and they used Shri Krishna
for that.

00:38:34.225 --> 00:38:39.965
All kinds of romanticism is attached.

00:38:39.965 --> 00:38:45.345
Sometimes I feel that people have not understood
Shri Krishna.

00:38:45.345 --> 00:38:51.225
But there's a nice story about Him.

00:38:51.225 --> 00:39:03.954
That once, His wives, He had many wives, that
is also another controversial point.

00:39:03.954 --> 00:39:14.055
He had many wives, because these were sixteen
thousand powers of Shri Krishna, who had taken

00:39:14.055 --> 00:39:22.835
birth and were captured by one king and kept
in the prison.

00:39:22.835 --> 00:39:29.295
So He had to release them, they were released.

00:39:29.295 --> 00:39:36.955
Now how are they to live with Shri Krishna,
He was a young man - so He married all of

00:39:36.955 --> 00:39:39.015
them.

00:39:39.015 --> 00:39:43.085
That is the case of Mohammed Sahib also.

00:39:43.085 --> 00:39:49.005
He married all sixteen of them, they were
his powers.

00:39:49.005 --> 00:39:57.735
For a young man to keep sixteen thousand women
like a harem, what people would have thought

00:39:57.735 --> 00:40:00.235
of Him.

00:40:00.235 --> 00:40:02.335
So He married all of them.

00:40:02.335 --> 00:40:13.575
And another point about His life is, that
once these all these ladies, and He had also

00:40:13.575 --> 00:40:14.725
five wives.

00:40:14.725 --> 00:40:23.605
These five wives were the causal of the five
elements.

00:40:23.605 --> 00:40:30.795
So He had to go.

00:40:30.795 --> 00:40:39.025
Once, these ladies wanted to go to see one
great saint.

00:40:39.025 --> 00:40:45.585
And the river, which was there, was all completely
flooded.

00:40:45.585 --> 00:40:52.505
So, they came to Shri Krishna and told Him
that "How are we to cross? - because this

00:40:52.505 --> 00:40:55.625
is over flooded.

00:40:55.625 --> 00:40:59.905
He said "That's very easy to cross that river.

00:40:59.905 --> 00:41:07.445
This river is called as the Virgin River,
Nirmada, now they are having big fights over

00:41:07.445 --> 00:41:10.755
it in India nowadays, a big politics.

00:41:10.755 --> 00:41:24.124
So you go and tell her that "Oh River, if
Shri Krishna is a complete celibate personality,

00:41:24.124 --> 00:41:37.255
perfect brahmachari, if that is the truth,
you go down".

00:41:37.255 --> 00:41:44.735
And the river went down - and they crossed
over.

00:41:44.735 --> 00:41:49.245
Then they went and worshipped the saint and
when they came back to the bank of the river

00:41:49.245 --> 00:41:54.384
it was again very much flooded.

00:41:54.384 --> 00:41:57.015
So they went to that saint and asked him "Now,
how are we to go back?".

00:41:57.015 --> 00:41:59.045
He said "How did you come?".

00:41:59.045 --> 00:42:06.884
They said "this is what Shri Krishna asked
us to tell the river".

00:42:06.884 --> 00:42:15.985
"Alright, you go and tell the river that this
saint has not eaten any food whatsoever, nothing",

00:42:15.985 --> 00:42:24.855
while they saw him eating plates after plates,
if this is the truth, then you better recede.

00:42:24.855 --> 00:42:32.565
So, they went down and told the river, and
the river went down.

00:42:32.565 --> 00:42:39.085
They were amazed that this man ate such a
lot of things and this river has gone down

00:42:39.085 --> 00:42:42.185
thinking this is the truth.

00:42:42.185 --> 00:42:51.745
That means -
what has been their character?.

00:42:51.745 --> 00:42:53.715
They're abhogis.

00:42:53.715 --> 00:43:07.905
They're abhogis means, they do not get, indulge
into it, they eat, all right, but they don't

00:43:07.905 --> 00:43:14.945
care, they don't have that feeling of eating,
and feeling of enjoying the food, and nothing

00:43:14.945 --> 00:43:18.175
of the kind, they are just eating.

00:43:18.175 --> 00:43:29.505
And this gentleman with seventeen, I should
say sixteen thousand and five wives, is called

00:43:29.505 --> 00:43:34.145
as Brahmachari, because they are not involved.

00:43:34.145 --> 00:43:41.875
They are in Sar state.

00:43:41.875 --> 00:43:49.925
With such a great immaculate personality like
Shri Krishna, the way they have created this

00:43:49.925 --> 00:43:53.205
nonsense of romanticism.

00:43:53.205 --> 00:44:08.015
For America, I think they have gone too far
with the freedom they have.

00:44:08.015 --> 00:44:18.475
As people with Shri Krishna's blessings became
free from all the rules, regulations and got

00:44:18.475 --> 00:44:19.505
abandoned.

00:44:19.505 --> 00:44:29.355
But America has gone much worse and not only
that, but the films they are producing are

00:44:29.355 --> 00:44:39.495
very dangerous films and really damaging the
whole world.

00:44:39.495 --> 00:44:46.144
They don't know what sin they are committing,
for thousands and thousands of people in the

00:44:46.144 --> 00:44:58.475
world have taken to all kinds of very destructive
ugly ideas.

00:44:58.475 --> 00:45:07.265
Freud, all right, he's ousted - finished,
he's done already a great harm.

00:45:07.265 --> 00:45:19.644
But what about these films, they are now very
much impressing our Indian directors.

00:45:19.644 --> 00:45:25.235
I think all these directors are guiding Indians
to hell.

00:45:25.235 --> 00:45:30.634
The whole thing is so absurd and so dirty.

00:45:30.634 --> 00:45:34.835
For an Indian mind it is really inconceivable.

00:45:34.835 --> 00:45:47.364
Even, I have seen Americans can't bear it,
it has gone that bad.

00:45:47.364 --> 00:45:53.925
Then other things have started with this freedom
that we have.

00:45:53.925 --> 00:46:06.175
Imagine if Shri Krishna was here, He would
never have put any oil in His head, He would

00:46:06.175 --> 00:46:11.045
have never combed His hair, as He must have
His [indistinct].

00:46:11.045 --> 00:46:17.585
And He might have worn some mod dresses from
America.

00:46:17.585 --> 00:46:22.624
Otherwise, you cannot exist.

00:46:22.624 --> 00:46:25.785
All the junk now has gone all over the world.

00:46:25.785 --> 00:46:39.505
Selling in Moscow, selling in all the developing
countries.

00:46:39.505 --> 00:46:47.124
Only thing, when it was declared that they
have AIDS - people used to buy even second

00:46:47.124 --> 00:46:51.335
hand from the tourists - they threw away all
that.

00:46:51.335 --> 00:46:58.835
They are carrying AIDS all over and drugs
all over.

00:46:58.835 --> 00:47:04.075
It's a destructive force.

00:47:04.075 --> 00:47:16.175
It's a destructive force, which is very active
in this Kali Yuga and so we have to have many

00:47:16.175 --> 00:47:21.945
Sahaja Yogis to fight this destructive force.

00:47:21.945 --> 00:47:32.465
And when they are destructive they are not
hypocritical, that's they think is a very

00:47:32.465 --> 00:47:33.465
great quality.

00:47:33.465 --> 00:47:39.015
But at least with hypocracy you can save some
people but when it's just an open thing everybody

00:47:39.015 --> 00:47:43.815
starts doing that.

00:47:43.815 --> 00:47:52.935
So when you think the time Shri Krishna lived
and the beautiful time they had, of such clean

00:47:52.935 --> 00:48:09.085
life and how He killed all these demons, is
something so beautiful, so energy giving.

00:48:09.085 --> 00:48:16.445
But how many demons there are nowadays in
this world - is it one? is it two?, is it

00:48:16.445 --> 00:48:17.445
ten?

00:48:17.445 --> 00:48:23.364
One is finished, another comes up like a mushroom
that is finished, third one comes up like

00:48:23.364 --> 00:48:25.155
a mushroom.

00:48:25.155 --> 00:48:36.295
And the most fertile land is America.

00:48:36.295 --> 00:48:42.505
So you all have to pay attention to this land
of Shri Krishna.

00:48:42.505 --> 00:48:52.245
Especially Shri Krishna should really start
using His Sudarshana Chakra, would be a good

00:48:52.245 --> 00:48:54.465
idea.

00:48:54.465 --> 00:48:55.465
The time has come.

00:48:55.465 --> 00:48:59.335
That's why I gave you the conch.

00:48:59.335 --> 00:49:05.175
To declare the time has come to clean this
America.

00:49:05.175 --> 00:49:07.215
That is the thing we have to do.

00:49:07.215 --> 00:49:17.095
Today when we worship Shri Krishna, you must
awaken within you yourself that consciousness,

00:49:17.095 --> 00:49:23.385
that now Shri Krishna is within all of you.

00:49:23.385 --> 00:49:35.495
And by your communication, because He's collective,
by your speech, by your songs, by all that

00:49:35.495 --> 00:49:47.465
you use to communicate with others, should
carry the message of peace, of love, of compassion,

00:49:47.465 --> 00:49:53.275
of truth and above all of Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:53.275 --> 00:49:58.027
MAY GOD BLESS YOU !!!
