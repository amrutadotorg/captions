00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:15.200
Now it says, that all of you who are one in your spirit

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.720
this is all description of Sahaja Yoga today

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.640
is the future, the present that you will get it

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.880
at this time what is going to happen, it is so beautifully shown,

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.640
you will be surprised, that you all will become one in the universe

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.640
the spirit of the universe will be satisfied

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.200
with the yadnyas they are going to,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.560
with the five ceremonies you are going to.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.040
How [inaudible] he said it three hundert years back.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.640
And then You should give us the milk of Your blessings,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.280
by getting the complete satisfaction from Us.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.400
That time all the horrible, evil people

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.520
will be ruined and their plan will be  spoiled

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.880
and people will take to righteousness.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.560
This is the description they [inaudible]

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:51.160
and that time there will be a tremendous friendship

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.040
of the spirit among people.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.000
Those who are in ignorance will get light.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.480
The whole universe will see the light,

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.560
the sun of one universal religion.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.480
What ever you will desire, what ever they will desire,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.480
they will get it.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.040
All the human beings.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.880
Worshipp?

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:05.040
Then you will meet Us, there will be a shower of blessings

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.840
and of course of Chaitanya, then you will meet, that's Me, ah.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.920
[Here Mother speaks in Hindi]

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.880
[Here Mother speaks in Hindi]

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.200
This is the description of Sahaja Yogis, what must be said today

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.880
that they will be the forrests

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.960
like [inaudible], means in many thousands

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:50.040
like moving forrests of huge trees,

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.000
of blessing giving, of giving blessings,

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.320
trees that gives blessings and can give -

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.320
Kalpataru is the tree that gives you whatever you want

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.600
and they will be like the moving forrests,

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.440
means all of you are like that, great

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.880
that you will be like the great trees,

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.120
like this trees are, great trees which are moving,

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.600
but which are bestowing blessings upon others,

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.200
giving them what they want, Kalpataru.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.080
They will be now you people,

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.440
they will be the ocean or

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.000
talking, oceans of talking or bubbling

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.520
Amrutha, Amrutha is a nectar, the nectar of life.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.000
You will be the oceans of the bubbling nectar

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.480
which are talking, like this ocean here.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.880
See the trees and the ocean, the ocean that talks of,

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.360
in a way that it just ammits nectar,

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.640
the nectar of bliss, that's you people.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.080
Now the day will be like the moon witout any spots on it,

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:34.880
immaculate [inaudible] which has no spots, non colour on it,

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.240
colour [inaudible] on it, no blemish, without any blemish.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:52.600
Like the sun which have got, sun, the sun which is without any heat,

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.760
that is you, the sun.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.560
Now all such people who will be righteous,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.520
who will stand for the right, for the truth

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.960
are going to be related to each other,

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.960
are going to be related in the whole world.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.880
Now with this beginning - [Shri Mataji talks aside in Hindi]

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.720
With this beginning we understand

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:33.880
that the great saints of Maharashtra in that time,

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.800
the greatest was Ganeshwara,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.680
because He saw the future that's going to come

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.040
and He told people about you,

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.960
that the man of God will become prophets

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.160
and they will have powers to make others prophets.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:53.080
Now we do not realize what are we when we become Sahaja Yogis.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:59.880
We become so much still worried about things which have no value.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.920
If you see in the ultimate

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.040
all the things have no value, because they are so temporary

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.720
and if you go on wasting your energy

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.520
about things that have no spiritual value,

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.880
that doesn't matter, you are going to waste your life,

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.320
because now you are there what is described,

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.880
the oceans which are talking nectars, oceans of talking nectars,

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.920
nectar, not the nectar that we understand,

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.840
nectar of spiritual bliss.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.000
You are that and when you are that,

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:44.760
then what is expected of you about yourself, just find out.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.280
You just find out yourself reflect back

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.560
what is expected of me of myself?

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.720
What am I doing about it?

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:56.480
I am worried about this nonsense, that nonsense

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:04.920
and I am supposed to be the ocean of blissfull nectar.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:13.920
I am supposed to be the forrest of the Kalpatarus,

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.720
the trees that give the boon to the people,

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.360
huge big trees and then what am I doing?

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:28.000
My giving-capacity is so low, what do I give up?

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.040
I don't even have attention

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:35.800
that can absorb the energy of the Divine.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.960
The attention should be such

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.640
that I should be able to absorb the attention of the Divine.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.000
Instead of that my attention is on wrong things.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.200
And what am I doing?

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.960
What do I do about myself is that

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:57.400
I am not trying to manifest that special quallity,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.040
the highest quallity, the one that I am.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:05.840
I am born after it, I have been born so many times,

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.240
I have been a saint, I have been going arround seeking God

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.440
I have been going arround and again when I am born in this life-time

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.280
for such a tremendous task again I am lost

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.560
with the same nonsense?

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.680
And still moving about with the same nonsense.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.280
If you understand that

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.000
then you will know that what importance it has today

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:32.080
on this day of our international seminar.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.240
Internationally you are all related to each other and to nobody.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.680
Internationally.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.760
You are all relations to each other.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:49.160
These are the relations which are relations of deep friendship.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.360
Friendship has no [inaudible], has no lust, no gread, nothing,

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.280
it's just friendship.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:00.280
Pure relationship and we are that because we have left ...

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.320
What is the matter with you, Madame?

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.000
Will you please go and - that side!

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:08.960
This is not to be done, [inaudible], please sit down!

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.600
Hello, get out! This is not to be done when I am speaking.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.240
What are you doing?

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.200
I just don't understand.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:47.560
Am I talking just a odd which has any meaning or not

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.240
in your hearts or I am just talking without a meaning?

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.280
Sometimes I don't understand if I am talking to real Sahaja Yogis

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.880
or I am talking to some walls here

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.680
that who are not bothered about what I am talking.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.400
Bring down to your attention

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.440
what am I saying. It is important.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.440
Otherwise how are you going to learn?

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.080
Where is your attention?

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.920
So it's all right to say that it is all love,

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.000
it's all affection, it's all goodness,

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.480
it's all very sweet thing, you see,

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.000
but you must know that you have to come up.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:48.120
These trees have come up after a great struggle,

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:54.800
against the whole atmosphere, against the whole surroundings.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.360
They have come up on their own,

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:02.000
except for the Mother Earth to [inaudible].

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:09.920
So you people must know that you all are here to come up,

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:17.360
to fight yourself, find out what's wrong with you.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.560
What is your attention first of all?

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.120
The attention has to move in such a manner

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.720
that outward you grow

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:35.320
and inward you hold fast to your Mother.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.720
With complete respect.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.680
Those who cannot do it are absolutely useless.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:46.400
If any tree doesn't try to hold fast this Mother Earth

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.600
it will fall out.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:53.240
I mean it is just what it is doing and for which it is rewarded.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.800
It's nothing to do with the Mother Earth.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.520
The Mother Earth has this speciality.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.400
[Here Mother speaks in Hindi]

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.400
This Mother Earth has this speciality

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.280
and if this Mother Earth

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:13.440
is not going to be linked by you, by your [inaudible].

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.200
Continious identification,

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:24.600
or you are going to fall out like a dead tree.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:29.240
So it is very important to understand that you are great,

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.120
no doubt, these trees are great,

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.720
they are forced through, they have come up

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:40.680
but where is your attention and what are you here for?

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:47.000
What is needed to stick in,

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:54.280
sticking to things which are against your growth?

00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:01.280
Bothered about things which go against you all the time?

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.200
The first and foremost thing that goes against us

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.480
is our own nonsensical ego.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.400
You must understand this ego is the one,

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.600
is the greatest barriere within us

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.440
and we have to get out of it.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:22.160
The Kundalini has to rise like the tree has this [inaudible].

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:31.360
And the ego is the biggest, biggest hurdle for most of it.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.800
It appears in many ways,

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.200
we fight the Mother Earth which is giving you the source.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.560
You are the very [inaudible] of that Mother.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.040
She has created you, She has made you.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.440
Because of Her you have come up. You are fighting Her

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.960
[inaudible] Her, going against ...

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.200
This is your ego, how will you grow?

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:58.040
And once you start growing the sun can help you.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:04.000
The sky, everything can help you, the nature can help you,

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.440
but you must have complete desire to rise

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:11.160
about your dwarvness,

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.640
about your selfishness,

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:20.480
about your conditionings and especially your ego.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.120
All this when we say that you are this,

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.720
there is no need to be puffed up,

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.800
you see, if I tell a little tree that you are going to be a big tree

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.520
it doesn't mean that it becomes a big tree.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:39.640
One has to become the big tree by pushing forward

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:49.840
and that quallity like Ganeshvara, like Tucarama, like Ramdas

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.080
you all have to become that qualility.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:58.920
They never saw Me, I just nurrished them, without [inaudible] Me,

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:05.160
but they nurrished theselves on their own virtues,

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.120
on their own qualilities, on their own greatness.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.400
You have to be great like them.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:20.560
Instead of that if you live with false emotions about yourself,

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:28.720
artificial things, absurd ideas,

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.720
all nonsense that we have gathered through our [inaudible],

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:37.080
through our rationality, through our reading, through our Gurus

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:42.200
and through our own mental projections

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.800
are going to be extremely dangerous

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
for the growth of every individual Sahaja Yogi

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.560
and as a whole also it will effect.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:58.240
So we have to take a vow

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:03.720
that we are going to behave in a manner

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.920
which beholds our advent and [inaudible]

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:14.520
our advent at this time which is being described

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:24.000
and prophesized. Prophecy was made long time.

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:36.240
If we understand that we have come on this Earth for that purpose

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:41.600
we'll really separate ourselves from all the rest of the nonsense

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:47.720
that goes on and try to rise towards the sky

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:51.080
as these trees have done.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:18:00.880
We should not follow any other Sahaja Yogi

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:06.680
in all anti-growth activities

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.680
and anyone who tries to create a kind of a group

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.280
or tries to impress you by saying

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.280
that he can teach you something higher, [inaudible]

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.960
all kinds of technices and this and that you have to do.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:27.080
First of all you must know that Sahaja Yoga is a growth within

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.440
and that growth expresses itself outsides.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.280
So that within growth is to be done by you fully,

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.680
with full understanding.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.360
Then I don't have to tell you about anyone

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:45.960
You won't will be volnerable to nonsensecall talk and jabbering.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.360
You have some people who are intellectuals.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:54.920
Intellectuals have a bad habbit of intellectuallizing everything.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:59.360
Intellegence is nothing for God, because God has created it.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.880
So you have to see through that.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.160
There are some people who are very emotional

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.120
and try to express themselves emotional.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.360
You have to get out of those ideas

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.040
and you have to understand

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:19.600
that emotions can play a very dangerous role in life.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:26.360
Now we  have decided to have so many marriages in Bordi,

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.760
which is a very nice thing and auspicious thing.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.320
I am very happy about it,

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.400
that we are going to have so many marriages, it is auspicious,

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:39.680
because marriages are supported, blessed by God.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.440
Yours is special, because I am sitting here before you,

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.920
for these marriages.

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.280
But don't make a fuzz out of the marriage.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:55.640
Don't create a problem by becoming superficial about marriage.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.600
These are the marriages of Brahma-Eka

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.640
where one feels the one-ness of the spirit

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.320
of the all-pervading power.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:10.040
Try to know that these marriages are done among saints

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.960
and not among ordinary people.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.880
Try to respect the inner quallity of a person.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:22.160
If somebody is a Sahaja Yogi of high quallity that must be respected

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:27.680
and that must be done and not the outer quallities.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.760
The outward quallities are nonsensically.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.360
You must respect each other when you marry,

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.720
because you are all saints.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.760
You are saints of very high quallity, I have told you

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:43.200
and the potential is so great, which is allready described

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:49.560
that only your assumption can get you that way.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.040
The whole world is hoping to happen these things,

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.520
that they should get such people on this Earth,

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.080
so they are described.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:23.320
The whole world is watching your progress,

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.120
the whole world is expecting this to happen,

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:30.880
the whole world has allready pronounced it

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.560
and where are we?

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.520
Where are we? Our progress is so slow.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.600
We are worried about stupid things,

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:43.000
material things, worldly things,

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:46.480
superficial things, artificial things.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.280
So one has to understand that you are here today

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:59.280
for this international seminar - promise Me.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:14.480
Everybody seems to be younger than Me in this group,

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:19.480
but you have to promise that Mother we'll work with the same zeal,

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:24.520
with the same attention as You are

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:29.800
and try to settle ourselves

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.160
fight for yourselves within.

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.760
We talk to much, talk to much, do nothing.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.720
Try to reserve your energy in that silent dignity.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.600
You must have full  ideas to what you are.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:00.360
You must understand, what have you been up to,

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:01.520
what have you done about it?

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.640
Talking, talking, talking -

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.360
that's not the way it is going to work out.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:12.320
The atmosphere is nice, everything is fine,

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.800
the future seems very jubilant, everything is fine,

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.960
but the highest about everything is

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.120
the hope of your Mother

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:32.320
that you are going to emancipate the whole world.

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.480
Give attention to that!

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.720
Think about it, that you are going to do that.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:48.640
You have to be them, walking, talking, moving

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:57.280
forrests of that divine love, that dambara pragnya.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:02.720
I hope you understand, today is a very important day,

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:10.360
I feel that if this holy session works out well

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:18.080
maybe we'll might achieve a lot next year.

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:48.320
Now so We have looked forward to a Puja today

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:53.040
and try to absorb.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.880
My chakras worked very hard

00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:02.120
and actually I find it sometimes impossible to accept the Puja.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:09.080
Today is a Puja of a great day and a great time.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:18.480
At this time a big resservoire has to be opened out,

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.440
but it is  to be channelized to people

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:27.200
and how can I channelize to people who are filled with vanity,

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:33.560
with stupidity or with small-mindedness?

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:43.280
We have to be large, huge, big-hearted, great people.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.600
We are all born again who were great today again,

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:53.440
but somehow you are still mixed up with your surrounding.

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.800
So try to understand your own importance

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.120
and the importance of the time.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:06.160
Is to worship yourself, to worship, but to be worshippable.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:10.640
You all think that only by dressing up properly

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.800
or by pushing up any show like that

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.520
we become worshippable, but we do not.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:22.160
We should be worshippable to ourselves,

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:28.520
to see that whatever we are doing it has that grace and beauty,

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.280
the love and the greatness

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:34.920
of the saints who are very great saints,

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:38.640
not ordinary but tremendous saints,

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:44.080
but it is been described actually

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:48.800
that Ganeshwara in this poem has really worshipped you.

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:51.960
I wish we had people like Ganeshwara,

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.480
but they are all inside My body.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:30:01.000
You are all outside and whatever is said has to be fullfilled,

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.640
not only that, but whatever is said is the truth.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:09.120
For all these Pujas you must have that depth, that greatness

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:14.840
of those great saints who came on this Earth

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:18.480
who worked for you, created this atmosphere,

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:20.400
think of them, what they have done,

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:25.080
they have fought, all the time, they were tortured,

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.840
they had none of these facilities as you have,

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:30.400
they had none of this enjoyment, nothing of that kind,

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:34.800
while you got it all, everything on the plate.

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:40.400
So be deserving people, authorized people

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.840
and work it out in that way.

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:46.200
Otherwise this world we cannot change.

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:51.880
This Puja has a very special significance upon you

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.280
and has to be done by people

00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:03.200
who know that they are these great personalities.

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:04.400
It has nothing to do

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:08.120
with your so called artificial positions in life

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:11.200
or anything that is outside,

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.600
is the inside.

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:21.360
In this seminar one should not talk too much about outside-things,

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:28.280
but just talk about God, about your Mother or about Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.880
Best thing is to talk about your Mother,

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:33.520
so you neutralize it [inaudible]

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:37.320
and it works out, it works out.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:40.440
It is a simple thing one has to understand

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:44.760
that God has been so kind to you, so kind.

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.840
You don't have to fight for your saintliness,

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.760
nothing, you are all brothers and sisters.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.720
You are all here, so much close to them, you are not alone.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:03.400
You are so great that you can know what you are.

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:09.720
Who told them, who looked after, who helped them?

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:15.600
Today you are just like V.I.P.s

00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:19.520
So please try to understand

00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:23.120
that you have to have a very humble attitude

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:28.240
towards all these saints and towards Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:31.160
Try to absorb as much as possible.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.920
be kind to yourself.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.240
May God bless you all.

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.800
Now today the problem is always there,

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.720
who is going to do the worship and worships Me.

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.600
I would say for today there should be no such choice

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.000
who is going to do it.

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.640
It can be just washed without anybody touching that water,

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.400
is the best idea.

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:51.240
Now all the girls who are going to get married, please come forward.

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:02.400
You have to cover your heads.

01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:35.360
Cover your heads please, all those who are getting married.

01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:13.360
You are entering into a married life

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:16.440
and you have been worthy so far

01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:22.400
and now you have to enter into another life of marriage

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:26.040
and it is a great responsibility on all of you

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:30.920
to see that you make your marriages successfull.

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:35.560
It is your responsibility much more than that of your men

01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:39.720
and you have to see that you behave in such a manner

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:46.760
that it creates a proper motherhood within yourself

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:51.480
and a disciplin that you want your children to imbibe

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:53.360
and your husband.

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.640
You have seen your motherhood [inaudible]

01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:59.800
and we are sitting for nine to ten hours sometimes at one place

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.960
not even getting out of this place,

01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:08.240
but I have seen people that they can't sit for two hours

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:11.120
and a place, even if they are meditating all this

01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:13.800
and they'll get up, disturb everybody else and come down.

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:16.840
This is a sign that we lack in our discipline,

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:21.000
that our parentship did not [inaudible], that we did not discriminate.

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:24.560
So now first thing is that, you have to have a perfect discipline

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:29.080
of your temperament and that is a sign that you are the people

01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:31.200
who represent this Mother Earth,

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:34.280
who has a special wisdom

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:40.240
and a special power to express depht.

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:45.320
So all of you have to be extremely carefull

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:52.280
that whatever you do will be reflected in the whole family

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:58.040
and in the whole Sahaja Yoga system.

01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:02.320
Now when you get married to your husband

01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:05.360
try to understand that you are the Mother Earth

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:07.080
and you have to give

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:09.080
and because you have powers to give

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:12.440
because you have so  many shaktis within you you have to give.

01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:15.280
That means you are superior in a way, that you can give,

01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:17.840
so that your ego should not stand up all the time and say,

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.760
why should I give, why should I?

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:23.240
And then you will start enjoying this womanhood.

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:27.840
So try to be good Mothers,

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:32.280
good wives and responsible Sahaja Yoginis.

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.720
Those who after marriage

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:37.640
try to deveate their husbands from Sahaja Yoga

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:40.760
are really most [inaudible: cursedly?].

01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:46.280
You should have sweet tongue for others, be carefull what you talk.

01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:49.800
You have to be responsible, you are special people

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.600
that you are married in Sahaja Yoga.

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:55.200
I hope you will keep this in your mind.

01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:16.720
Now this time [inaudible] I  have to do this speech

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:19.200
but I'll ask somebody else to do it

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:24.840
but you should touch each other and do it [inaudible] in a symbole.

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:03.680
You all should touch each other, come forward!

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:07.600
Touch there and you will be really first.

01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:11.960
You are first [inaudible].

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:30.200
You have to touch these feet.

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:45.640
Everybody must know that there have to be discipline.

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:49.440
And the body is not to be made work out in such a way

01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:52.805
that it should dominate you.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:58.480
At the time of meditation the body should be your slave, completely.

01:30:35.170 --> 01:30:42.770
This is the, these are the virtues of a worship.

01:30:43.410 --> 01:30:47.610
The power of worship, actually it works.

01:30:50.170 --> 01:30:54.570
She is alone without Shiva, all these [inaudible] without Shiva.

01:40:20.850 --> 01:40:25.370
[inaudible: Rupam?] means an auspicious personality,

01:40:25.570 --> 01:40:29.010
means auspicious personality, [inaudible: rupam?].

01:44:33.690 --> 01:44:38.010
Now the married women all done My [inaudible] go back

01:44:38.370 --> 01:44:42.170
that the married women can go.

01:45:48.890 --> 01:45:51.330
All married women should come here.

01:45:51.530 --> 01:45:56.650
A married woman has many [inaudible] come infront!

01:46:07.970 --> 01:46:10.130
Married in Sahaja Yoga,

01:46:10.330 --> 01:46:13.410
those who are married in Sahaja Yoga.

01:46:23.450 --> 01:46:27.170
All the ladies who are married in Sahaja Yoga.

01:46:40.330 --> 01:46:42.290
That's all?

01:46:42.570 --> 01:46:46.770
All those who got married in Sahaja Yoga allready.

01:50:11.010 --> 01:50:15.490
All those who want to take photograph can come.

01:55:00.890 --> 01:55:03.930
Now you can all go and sit down.

01:55:51.330 --> 01:55:59.330
Now the thing is all Sahaja Yoga terminologie has integrated.

01:56:00.010 --> 01:56:05.130
If you say "success" it means good reputation

01:56:05.370 --> 01:56:08.330
that has come out of righteousness.

01:56:08.530 --> 01:56:12.010
Anybody who has a success is not  a perfect fellow

01:56:12.250 --> 01:56:13.690
who has [inaudible].

01:56:13.890 --> 01:56:17.050
In Sanskrit-language it is said the other way round,

01:56:17.250 --> 01:56:18.490
if you have got so far something,

01:56:18.690 --> 01:56:20.650
supposing somebody who becomes a minister,

01:56:20.850 --> 01:56:25.210
for all practical purposes he is supposed to be a person

01:56:25.410 --> 01:56:28.570
who has got success in the english sense,

01:56:28.930 --> 01:56:33.130
but in the Sanskrit-language the [inaudible: yesha?] means a person

01:56:33.450 --> 01:56:37.570
who achieves something which gives him good reputation,

01:56:37.810 --> 01:56:41.130
righteous reputation, reputation of virtue.

01:56:41.490 --> 01:56:44.570
Such a person need not be a very wealthy man

01:56:44.770 --> 01:56:48.650
need not be so successfull as a minister or a primeminister,

01:56:48.850 --> 01:56:52.610
but a success that gives you great reputation.

01:56:52.850 --> 01:56:55.770
and a success of the saints, the [inaudible: vidyesha?].

01:56:56.010 --> 01:56:57.770
So one of [inaudible]

01:56:57.970 --> 01:57:00.290
that in Sahaja Yoga all the words, now rupa,

01:57:00.490 --> 01:57:04.490
Rup can mean in a normal way is that just the goodness

01:57:04.930 --> 01:57:07.530
but in Sahaja Yoga it [inaudible: do not mean the?] goodness.

01:57:08.050 --> 01:57:13.850
It means the look or the appearence that is blissfull.

01:57:16.530 --> 01:57:18.770
You see, that means blessing.

01:57:19.050 --> 01:57:23.850
The faith that gives blessings and not negative.

01:57:26.610 --> 01:57:32.410
So it's an integrated termonology, one word means many things.

01:57:37.490 --> 01:57:40.010
People should not confuse because good looks

01:57:40.210 --> 01:57:43.570
can be like a cinema-actress, that's not [inaudible: good look?].

01:57:43.770 --> 01:57:46.730
Good look means "not glamorous", you see?

01:57:46.970 --> 01:57:52.690
A look that is blissfull, auspicious.

02:06:17.290 --> 02:06:19.330
This is the first bliss to show

02:06:19.530 --> 02:06:24.450
that you ask something for your body from your Mother,

02:06:24.650 --> 02:06:26.170
which attends humility

02:06:26.370 --> 02:06:31.410
that oh Mother, please give me a morsel of food.

02:06:32.490 --> 02:06:34.210
It is a sign of humility,

02:06:34.410 --> 02:06:40.610
whatever Mother gives me will be the blissfull thing, it [inaudible] us.

02:06:41.050 --> 02:06:44.290
Now the second part of it, worldly part.

02:08:16.410 --> 02:08:19.370
You see, She gives me the bliss of Yoga,

02:08:19.570 --> 02:08:25.210
the joy of Yoga and the joy of complete freedom. Mukta.

02:08:25.610 --> 02:08:28.410
[inaudible: Muktiir], complete divine.

02:08:28.690 --> 02:08:31.170
The joy of Nirmal.

02:09:57.410 --> 02:10:00.010
Nira means the One that is been described,

02:10:00.210 --> 02:10:03.090
so far the One who is being described.

02:10:03.450 --> 02:10:05.770
Like scriptures and things is Nira,

02:10:06.010 --> 02:10:08.810
which has come out of our minds and kept over.

02:10:09.050 --> 02:10:12.850
So She is the One who makes us penetrate

02:10:13.170 --> 02:10:16.050
into the meanings of this.

02:10:18.730 --> 02:10:21.570
Whatever is manifested or expressed,

02:10:21.770 --> 02:10:24.250
She is the One who makes us penetrate,

02:10:24.490 --> 02:10:28.130
because She gives you that subtler attention.

02:10:31.450 --> 02:10:33.690
She is the One who is the Om Kara,

02:10:33.930 --> 02:10:39.170
which is the bija-akshara, is the main-syllable,

02:10:43.530 --> 02:10:48.690
the One who opens the Mokshas door.

02:10:54.010 --> 02:10:58.370
She is the One who should give me alms of realization.

02:10:58.570 --> 02:11:03.650
[inaudible] is all the way of saying something in a very humble way.

02:11:03.890 --> 02:11:08.890
The humble way that gives Me the alms of realization.

02:11:10.530 --> 02:11:15.690
Like a beggar would say that I beggar please give me realization,

02:11:15.930 --> 02:11:19.330
I am a beggar at your door.

02:12:31.050 --> 02:12:36.410
This is the One who gives the prologue in a drama,

02:12:36.650 --> 02:12:40.690
is the One who holds the course in a show,

02:12:41.090 --> 02:12:43.290
where the [inaudible] are there,

02:12:43.530 --> 02:12:44.690
is called as the shukradara,

02:12:44.890 --> 02:12:47.930
the One who is the holder of the thread.

02:12:48.250 --> 02:12:53.250
She is the one who holds all the Shukras in Her hand,

02:12:53.490 --> 02:12:54.610
all the threads in Her hand

02:12:54.850 --> 02:12:57.450
and just breakes us through all the drama.

02:12:57.650 --> 02:13:01.530
It's all Her own style, it's true, I agree.

02:13:33.330 --> 02:13:35.610
She keeps and naturally, you see, if you don't give Him peace,

02:13:35.890 --> 02:13:40.250
He destroys the world, so keep Him pleased all the time.

02:13:40.610 --> 02:13:42.130
That's what the women must understand,

02:13:42.330 --> 02:13:45.250
they must keep their husbands peace.

02:14:55.290 --> 02:14:58.650
Kashmira Tripureshwari means to be in Sahasrara.

02:14:59.010 --> 02:15:02.570
The Himalayas are the Sahasrara and Kashmir is there.

02:15:02.810 --> 02:15:05.170
So Kashmir, you see, is there.

02:15:05.370 --> 02:15:08.490
Tripura is because She killed the -

02:15:09.250 --> 02:15:11.450
There are two meanings for Tripura,

02:15:11.650 --> 02:15:16.090
one is meaning that She killed that horrible demon called Tripura

02:15:16.330 --> 02:15:19.410
and Tripura means "of the three worlds".

02:15:19.650 --> 02:15:21.690
She is the beauty of the three worlds, Tripurasundari.

02:15:21.930 --> 02:15:27.450
I mean the beauty is not to be confused, it should be integrated.

02:15:34.530 --> 02:15:41.730
She opens the door of the heavens, because [inaudible].

02:15:51.170 --> 02:15:55.930
Niranan, it should be same thing like in English, the second birth.

02:16:29.490 --> 02:16:32.930
You are complete, [inaudible] when you are complete,

02:16:33.170 --> 02:16:37.090
because you see after Sahasrara you have to become perfect.

02:16:43.210 --> 02:16:46.130
Victory, it gives victory, victory over ignorance

02:16:46.330 --> 02:16:48.690
by giving realization.

02:16:51.410 --> 02:16:56.330
Graces, grace, She is the ocean of grace.

02:17:12.570 --> 02:17:14.810
With Her black hair ...

02:17:20.010 --> 02:17:23.810
She uses Her hair to give you realization.

02:17:26.090 --> 02:17:28.770
All the tricks ... ah?

02:17:33.090 --> 02:17:36.130
Ananda, vidya-ananda.

02:17:36.330 --> 02:17:41.250
She gives you the food of joy all the time.

02:17:46.570 --> 02:17:51.370
She gives you actualization of realization.

02:17:51.570 --> 02:17:54.330
Actualization of realization.

02:19:16.410 --> 02:19:19.210
Daksha came as Ali.

02:19:26.850 --> 02:19:31.290
He came as Ali, that's why you are [inaudible] of Daksha.

02:21:04.570 --> 02:21:07.850
[inaudible]

02:30:31.170 --> 02:30:35.570
There are seven colours in this [inaudible]

02:31:33.850 --> 02:31:38.890
Let Me have Aarti after the Havan,

02:31:39.090 --> 02:31:40.850
we'll have Aarti after the Havan,

02:31:41.050 --> 02:31:43.810
now you all do your collective Namaskar.
