00:00:14.878 --> 00:00:20.560
I bow all the  seekers of spirit.

00:00:22.767 --> 00:00:28.427
The seeking of spirit has been described

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.443
by so many people from ancient times.

00:00:31.787 --> 00:00:34.736
It is nothing new that I’m telling you

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.106
that a human awareness reaches a point

00:00:39.265 --> 00:00:44.390
where it starts seeing that there has to be something beyond

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:47.508
and at that time  the seeking starts.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.107
And the person starts looking forward to  something

00:00:51.504 --> 00:00:54.577
that will make that person the spirit,

00:00:54.805 --> 00:01:00.743
as all this scriptures have described and talked about it.

00:01:01.476 --> 00:01:06.261
There is no amount of talking is going to improve on that

00:01:06.414 --> 00:01:11.520
because, spirit is within us it resides within us in our heart .

00:01:11.781 --> 00:01:16.076
Now as it is you must have heard many people talking about it

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:20.676
that you have to be spirit that

00:01:20.926 --> 00:01:26.781
you have to get your self realization,
you have to  have self knowledge you have to know yourself

00:01:27.076 --> 00:01:32.051
but in Sahaja Yoga today what one has to do is to establish that

00:01:32.164 --> 00:01:36.296
to actualize that make it an experience of your own

00:01:36.437 --> 00:01:40.296
and this is a very big gift I think a very unique discovery

00:01:40.444 --> 00:01:43.902
that has come to us that we can actualize.

00:01:44.118 --> 00:01:46.567
Now  we have to understand one simple think

00:01:46.704 --> 00:01:49.413
that when this spirit manifest within us,

00:01:49.532 --> 00:01:53.828
what should happen on the very gross level what should happen.

00:01:54.022 --> 00:01:56.751
Firstly it must be invigorated,

00:01:56.888 --> 00:02:00.138
means you must get more energy in the body,

00:02:00.251 --> 00:02:03.408
You must feel physical limit.

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.973
By going to any process or any method or any experience

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:13.705
if health wise if you cannot improve then must know that it is not the spirit.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.606
Because spirit is complete health,

00:02:17.674 --> 00:02:21.145
or it never get sick, that is what Spirit is.

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:24.537
So first thing that should happen to you, is that

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.845
it should  be an invigorating life a very dynamic life.

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:33.503
Second thing that should happen to you is, that you become a very peaceful

00:02:33.628 --> 00:02:37.612
and a relax personality, not like the ones who were agitated

00:02:37.703 --> 00:02:39.832
and very angry and shout.

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:45.093
There is nothing to shout and get angry its a kind of a fear this people have perhaps

00:02:45.195 --> 00:02:49.183
that if the truth they face, or the reality that comes

00:02:49.308 --> 00:02:51.032
they will have no place in this world.

00:02:51.112 --> 00:02:55.187
That might be one of the reasons which makes them agitated.

00:02:55.301 --> 00:02:58.441
A person  like Christ, about who people talk

00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:02.668
and think that the Christ was, is in their pocket.

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:06.353
You must know that first and foremost thing the greatness of Christ

00:03:06.441 --> 00:03:10.965
was that, He used a weapon of forgiveness.

00:03:11.113 --> 00:03:14.137
He was such a peaceful person, on the cross also

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.184
that He said that forgive those

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:21.769
who are doing this O Father,
because they do not know what they are doing.

00:03:21.872 --> 00:03:26.944
That kind of a personality, you can say is a spiritual personality.

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.136
and not a person who gets agitated and hot tempered

00:03:31.216 --> 00:03:33.077
and start shouting at people.

00:03:33.228 --> 00:03:38.054
The time today is extremely precarious, which we do not realize.

00:03:38.145 --> 00:03:42.148
For example, if you ask these people if Christ comes and stands here

00:03:42.225 --> 00:03:44.356
how will they recognize Christ?

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.381
Is there any way of recognizing Christ?

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.034
They might be those who crucified Christ,
because they did not recognize at that time.

00:03:53.287 --> 00:03:56.174
How we will recognize Christ, is a very simple question.

00:03:56.243 --> 00:03:58.136
which we never try to answer.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.868
There’s no way to understand how we are going to recognize Christ.

00:04:03.096 --> 00:04:09.316
A very very simple question has no answer because you can't.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.154
You cannot recognize Him.

00:04:11.392 --> 00:04:14.782
Because your awareness cannot make you understand.

00:04:14.885 --> 00:04:18.786
Like somebody told me that there’s somebody who claims that he is Christ.

00:04:18.888 --> 00:04:22.676
I said all right, ask him to  walk on the water.

00:04:23.413 --> 00:04:28.874
If he can walk on the water then think that is Christ.
That's one of the qualities of Christ

00:04:29.684 --> 00:04:35.358
Now, whatever is the quality of a particular advent
is to be seen in that advent.

00:04:35.517 --> 00:04:38.987
Every advent has a particular quality

00:04:39.041 --> 00:04:43.089
which is being already described in the ancient books.

00:04:43.313 --> 00:04:47.119
You should not accept anybody
because he says I'm this  and I'm that.

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:50.643
This is the problem with us, that we get ourselves value,

00:04:50.825 --> 00:04:53.467
to some sort of mental conception live with  it,

00:04:53.565 --> 00:04:56.626
our forefathers lived with it, their forefathers have lived with it

00:04:56.681 --> 00:04:59.901
and ultimately we find there is nothing left.

00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:04.555
So one has to know that when you,

00:05:04.668 --> 00:05:08.369
at least when you say that you believe in Christ,

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.317
how will you recognise if Christ comes.

00:05:11.488 --> 00:05:12.962
Is there any matter?

00:05:13.053 --> 00:05:16.681
Is there any shown matter that will tell you that He is Christ?

00:05:16.917 --> 00:05:17.917
There is!

00:05:18.103 --> 00:05:21.324
You should become the spirit. You have vibrations.

00:05:21.483 --> 00:05:22.591
You feel coolness.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.078
You have a new awareness a vibrated awareness, the fifth dimension

00:05:26.146 --> 00:05:31.305
within you rises into that point  by which, when you ask,

00:05:31.827 --> 00:05:33.638
"Is this Christ?"

00:05:33.854 --> 00:05:38.640
The vibrations will flow, tremendously.

00:05:39.377 --> 00:05:41.372
You will know, this is Christ.

00:05:41.463 --> 00:05:45.417
If he is  a fake person, you might even get blisters in your cap,

00:05:45.565 --> 00:05:49.011
you might even get terrible heat from such a person.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.112
But if it is Christ, you'll get tremendous breeze in your hand.

00:05:54.555 --> 00:05:59.122
This is the sign how to make out whether he is Christ or not.

00:05:59.395 --> 00:06:02.926
That’s why he said that you will be calling me Christ, Christ

00:06:03.037 --> 00:06:08.080
I won’t recognize you, neither you will recognize Him.
That's a fact.

00:06:08.193 --> 00:06:10.961
You live with an idea with a mental projection

00:06:11.172 --> 00:06:15.043
and then you came all your

00:06:15.645 --> 00:06:19.787
possibilities, chances of your ascent.

00:06:20.036 --> 00:06:23.509
You must keep yourself open like a scientist  does,

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:27.126
keep yourself open. Your mind should be open.

00:06:27.226 --> 00:06:30.091
You should not close down by any dogma

00:06:30.194 --> 00:06:34.011
or any time off such theory that makes you

00:06:34.113 --> 00:06:40.052
completely excluded from the rest of the thing,

00:06:40.143 --> 00:06:43.257
or which makes you non reflect,

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:46.705
which makes you a person who cannot reflect,

00:06:46.864 --> 00:06:50.701
cannot think anymore about.

00:06:51.034 --> 00:06:57.143
Such a personality who developed,
which is going to be very, very dangerous for you.

00:06:57.404 --> 00:07:01.248
So the personality should be open,

00:07:01.917 --> 00:07:06.412
should be receptive you understand.

00:07:06.494 --> 00:07:10.517
Now, as I told you yesterday back it is a spontaneous happening

00:07:10.582 --> 00:07:14.150
is the happening off the living process within you.

00:07:14.303 --> 00:07:17.155
It is nothing to do with artifical things.

00:07:17.418 --> 00:07:21.599
Of course in the churches were established
they try to be good to people in the sense

00:07:21.679 --> 00:07:25.039
they told them that to be in the balance
you keep the balance another

00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:29.372
but it went too far with certain things like baptism, I think

00:07:29.463 --> 00:07:32.585
that where they everybody started putting their hands

00:07:32.631 --> 00:07:36.845
on top of anyone I'm said that your baptised

00:07:37.413 --> 00:07:39.469
that's not proper

00:07:39.549 --> 00:07:42.863
but you call [....Hindi] means it is unauthorized.

00:07:43.016 --> 00:07:46.111
To baptize someone is not the authority

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:52.082
that you can get from any school colleges
but you have to get it from God.

00:07:52.229 --> 00:07:55.658
If you are a realized soul then you can baptize others.

00:07:55.783 --> 00:07:58.482
Everybody cannot baptize, everyone.

00:07:58.599 --> 00:08:03.978
Even, I don't think Christ disciples baptize anyone, they did not.

00:08:04.288 --> 00:08:06.931
It is later on, I don't know how it croul

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:12.458
into the organization, that you could ask somebody
to go and baptize someone.

00:08:12.688 --> 00:08:14.442
William Blake has clearly said,

00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:19.123
that the priest cursed me on my head and I cried and wept.

00:08:19.295 --> 00:08:22.467
Actually, that person who has to baptize,

00:08:22.547 --> 00:08:24.371
has to be realized soul

00:08:24.463 --> 00:08:27.302
because, baptism means awakening of the Kundalini

00:08:27.414 --> 00:08:31.107
and breaking up this fontanel bone area

00:08:31.213 --> 00:08:36.853
open to the subtle and that
you cannot do it, so you better not do it.

00:08:36.978 --> 00:08:38.630
You are unauthorized.

00:08:38.971 --> 00:08:45.618
in all humbleness and humility one
must understand that that is not your job.

00:08:48.165 --> 00:08:51.887
Say for example, I do not know anything about the machinery,

00:08:52.013 --> 00:08:54.012
or about a car

00:08:54.138 --> 00:08:56.598
I start driving, what will happen?

00:08:56.744 --> 00:09:00.804
But same thing happens with people who do not have the authority

00:09:00.907 --> 00:09:03.674
to do God's work, start doing God's work.

00:09:03.777 --> 00:09:08.354
they lang everybody into difficulties,
and ultimately they neutralize themselves.

00:09:08.547 --> 00:09:11.345
It is high time for all of them now to see,

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:16.447
that what they have to do, all these institutions, is no dogma

00:09:16.584 --> 00:09:19.305
nothing like that, but what you have to do

00:09:19.419 --> 00:09:23.562
is to transform people through their Kundalini awakening.

00:09:23.676 --> 00:09:26.666
through their real baptism.

00:09:28.035 --> 00:09:30.280
This is what people have realized

00:09:30.337 --> 00:09:34.521
that there’s something wrong somewhere
that we are not connected to the mains.

00:09:34.695 --> 00:09:37.697
When it happens, the first thing that happens to you

00:09:37.832 --> 00:09:40.320
that you become collectively conscious as

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.562
Warren has told.

00:09:42.664 --> 00:09:45.250
this collectively consciousness is nothing but

00:09:45.318 --> 00:09:49.090
that your attention itself, your attention which is felt

00:09:49.198 --> 00:09:52.550
on the central nervous system gets enlightened.

00:09:53.198 --> 00:09:57.760
in the sense that as like ether, when you touch ether

00:09:57.887 --> 00:10:02.175
you can communicate anything from here to every place.

00:10:02.425 --> 00:10:08.417
In the same way, when you touch that All Pervading Power

00:10:08.624 --> 00:10:12.114
you can communicate through that power,

00:10:12.375 --> 00:10:17.160
anywhere sitting down, it is collectively conscious.

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:22.524
Moreover collectively conscious means that, you can feel a person

00:10:22.639 --> 00:10:25.178
whether he is the person he is

00:10:25.345 --> 00:10:29.099
allright or he has a problem or his...

00:10:29.224 --> 00:10:32.844
Kundalini is in this part of the body or

00:10:32.947 --> 00:10:35.180
if he has got some disease,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.445
you can feel also about yourself.

00:10:37.537 --> 00:10:38.999
That’s the sign of light,

00:10:39.112 --> 00:10:42.207
that you automatically feel how the person is.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:44.461
You may not of [INAUDABLE] a meeting

00:10:44.572 --> 00:10:48.351
say it loudly or you may not try to inform the person

00:10:48.429 --> 00:10:53.170
the other lady came to me and she was,
she was having cancer no doubt.

00:10:53.641 --> 00:10:57.753
But I didn't tell him, I tried and I think now she is cured.

00:10:57.982 --> 00:10:59.944
So, you don’t have to tell a person

00:11:00.024 --> 00:11:02.370
because you don’t have to achieve anything by telling,

00:11:02.414 --> 00:11:05.201
what you have to do is to achieve if she can be all right

00:11:05.284 --> 00:11:07.003
if you can give them realization.

00:11:07.197 --> 00:11:10.322
But your attitude is not to cure people.

00:11:10.425 --> 00:11:12.341
That's not the attitude of the Divine.

00:11:12.443 --> 00:11:14.122
Because it has got common sense.

00:11:14.258 --> 00:11:18.173
If you know that a certain car is going to be a junk forever,

00:11:18.246 --> 00:11:22.060
it is of no use, you don’t repair such cars.

00:11:22.491 --> 00:11:26.517
So, despite the affection and compassion you have for everyone,

00:11:26.653 --> 00:11:30.165
you want to see that by giving realization to this man

00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:33.405
who is absolutely good for nothing and all that

00:11:33.496 --> 00:11:38.205
you are just doing, throwing pearls before him.

00:11:39.056 --> 00:11:42.787
So you don’t even want to talk to such a man about realization,

00:11:42.882 --> 00:11:44.594
leave alone giving realization.

00:11:44.733 --> 00:11:48.497
This is such a headache to give realization to a man

00:11:48.546 --> 00:11:50.972
who is absolutely against God.

00:11:51.071 --> 00:11:55.028
Like Hitler for example, if he says that
"Mother, give me realization."

00:11:55.165 --> 00:11:57.516
What should I do?

00:11:58.212 --> 00:11:59.425
It is just like that.

00:11:59.606 --> 00:12:03.763
So you have to have basically a temprament of seek.

00:12:03.935 --> 00:12:06.963
If you are a seeker, then you get your realization

00:12:07.077 --> 00:12:10.376
and you become collectively conscious.

00:12:11.136 --> 00:12:16.292
With collective consciousness
you can also raise the Kundalini of people.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:18.809
You can cure.

00:12:19.127 --> 00:12:21.444
You can mentally improve them.

00:12:21.637 --> 00:12:24.078
You can settle them with peace.

00:12:24.204 --> 00:12:26.751
Then sitting down here,

00:12:26.839 --> 00:12:30.592
you can tell about everyone, what’s wrong with that person,

00:12:30.666 --> 00:12:34.780
and sitting down here, you can try to help others.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:39.131
It is not a difficult thing at all, because you become that.

00:12:39.223 --> 00:12:41.260
Like, you have seen a television.

00:12:41.385 --> 00:12:46.385
if it puts to the mains,
it start acting in such a fantastic manner,

00:12:46.485 --> 00:12:51.145
that nobody can believe that this little box can behave like this.

00:12:51.268 --> 00:12:55.750
In the same way this little box start
behaving in that fantastic manner.

00:12:55.868 --> 00:13:01.266
This should happen to you, otherwise
you should not believe that you have got realization.

00:13:01.592 --> 00:13:03.354
It is not a 'make believe' thing.

00:13:03.529 --> 00:13:06.056
It is not just a mental understanding,

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.884
that you are twice born, it is none of these things.

00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:12.460
It is something that has sprouted within you, which has to

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.290
If you are lower [INAUDABLE]

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.657
and if you really respect yourself,

00:13:16.804 --> 00:13:20.141
as people seeking the truth and nothing else,

00:13:20.238 --> 00:13:24.175
it happens to you, and grow completely in your growing.

00:13:25.356 --> 00:13:32.925
Secondly, what happens to you is that
you start understanding that it is the truth. How?

00:13:33.137 --> 00:13:36.224
Because supposing there were, as I told you,

00:13:36.318 --> 00:13:38.805
that there was a gentleman whose father was sick,

00:13:38.965 --> 00:13:41.984
and we did not know about it.
He wanted to know about his father.

00:13:42.097 --> 00:13:46.649
So I said, all right.
Put your hands and ask how is your father.

00:13:46.745 --> 00:13:51.670
He just asked his father and got
a burning sensation on this finger here.

00:13:52.291 --> 00:13:57.592
So he asked Me, so I called it,
I said this finger relates to this portion,

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.191
and these are the center’s of your father.

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:04.912
If it is so, then you better ask your father

00:14:04.952 --> 00:14:08.237
but I’m sure he must be down with very bad bronchitis.

00:14:08.472 --> 00:14:10.742
He telephoned to his mother in Scotland

00:14:10.861 --> 00:14:15.862
because she came on the phone and she said,
your father is down with very bad bronchitis.

00:14:16.014 --> 00:14:19.321
Sitting down there, I told him how you can cure him,

00:14:19.409 --> 00:14:23.896
and after that four,five hours he was out.

00:14:24.368 --> 00:14:25.488
It can be done.

00:14:25.737 --> 00:14:28.565
You are that fantastic, you are that glories.

00:14:28.663 --> 00:14:31.440
So your attention becomes enlightened.

00:14:31.599 --> 00:14:36.714
There is no question of you trying to put some spirits into things

00:14:36.774 --> 00:14:38.841
and do all these useless things.

00:14:38.909 --> 00:14:43.517
Only thing you have to do is, to awaken the spirit in that person

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.755
who is sick and the spirit takes over.

00:14:48.747 --> 00:14:51.609
Because it becomes also the truth.

00:14:51.864 --> 00:14:55.103
You start understanding that this the truth.

00:14:56.759 --> 00:14:58.680
Because you verified.

00:14:58.799 --> 00:15:00.960
Every moment, you verify.

00:15:01.056 --> 00:15:02.557
First the thing it's a fluke.

00:15:02.709 --> 00:15:04.481
Sometimes you think by chance,

00:15:04.838 --> 00:15:08.913
you think, "Oh maybe so", like later on, start seeing

00:15:09.062 --> 00:15:11.080
that it is true. It is so.

00:15:11.224 --> 00:15:15.224
You put ten children, if they are realized souls
and there are many these days,

00:15:15.287 --> 00:15:19.374
even in your country, we have seen lots of children
who are born realized.

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:24.664
You should tie up their eyes and put one person in front of them

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:29.349
and you asked them, "What’s the matter with this man?"
you tell us what's the thing.

00:15:29.534 --> 00:15:32.133
They raise one finger, this finger, supposing.

00:15:32.388 --> 00:15:35.582
You asking, "Did you have a heart attack?"
This shows the heart.

00:15:35.699 --> 00:15:40.543
"Yes I have. How do?" I said,
"All of them are showing one finger. This is the heart."

00:15:42.162 --> 00:15:45.281
And then you start understanding that, this is the truth.

00:15:45.377 --> 00:15:51.569
There is no argument, there is no other opinion about it,

00:15:51.729 --> 00:15:55.803
only one opinion, because truth is absolute!

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:59.132
Somebody says, this is Christ, somebody says that is Christ,

00:15:59.212 --> 00:16:01.671
somebody says this is Krishna, that is Rama.

00:16:01.754 --> 00:16:03.531
It is never like that!

00:16:03.627 --> 00:16:07.722
It is one. The truth is one, you cannot have two opinion.

00:16:07.887 --> 00:16:13.926
And is absolutely your subject, becomes enlightened
and  you can say this is the truth.

00:16:15.136 --> 00:16:20.086
So the second thing that happens to you,
that you start knowing the truth, which is absolute.

00:16:21.104 --> 00:16:23.843
Now, if you put your hands say like this.

00:16:23.914 --> 00:16:26.140
now, as you have become and a computer,

00:16:26.241 --> 00:16:28.543
you are a computer, which has starting.

00:16:28.655 --> 00:16:32.776
Even all these instruments that have come
are parallel to our evolution.

00:16:32.935 --> 00:16:35.061
Whatever is within us, has come.

00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:37.399
But, if you see a computer,

00:16:38.559 --> 00:16:41.776
it has to think. But without thinking,

00:16:41.903 --> 00:16:45.795
I mean, I look at you, I know you are there.
I don’t have a think about it.

00:16:46.081 --> 00:16:47.744
This kind of a computer

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.443
human beings will take thousands of years,
even to make

00:16:50.538 --> 00:16:53.530
that just thinks and spontaneously knows.

00:16:54.006 --> 00:16:56.470
We are already such a big computer, but

00:16:56.581 --> 00:17:00.076
we are even become absolute computers, when

00:17:00.195 --> 00:17:02.986
we start asking a question, "Is there God?"

00:17:03.322 --> 00:17:06.250
Now those who are atheist, if they ask the question,

00:17:06.348 --> 00:17:08.692
they start getting cool breeze on the hands.

00:17:09.951 --> 00:17:13.034
You ask any absolute question, "Was Christ the son of God?"

00:17:13.146 --> 00:17:15.028
Why should people accept Bible?

00:17:15.122 --> 00:17:17.677
Why should they accept anything?
The accept this.

00:17:17.844 --> 00:17:23.288
Because if you ask, you get the breeze,
cool breeze in the hands as an answer.

00:17:23.463 --> 00:17:25.292
Then you know it as a truth.

00:17:25.408 --> 00:17:28.733
But could be, people should know that, how is it absolute?

00:17:28.831 --> 00:17:33.862
I’ll tell you an example like us we have some fanatics here
in India we also have lots of fanatics.

00:17:34.127 --> 00:17:38.022
and in Pune they have arranged my program in a hall

00:17:38.154 --> 00:17:42.601
where, which was belonging to brahmins
they another type of

00:17:42.694 --> 00:17:45.982
twice born people. Self certified.

00:17:46.694 --> 00:17:50.000
So, they learned that I’m not a brahmin.

00:17:50.119 --> 00:17:53.664
So they were very angry and said,"We can not have your program."

00:17:53.819 --> 00:17:59.323
And our, these organizers did not tell me that
"Mother they don’t want to have your program,

00:17:59.433 --> 00:18:01.595
because you are not a brahmin." nothing they told me.

00:18:01.754 --> 00:18:06.360
But  they went and told that, "All right. If you don’t want
to have will publish it in the newspaper, because

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.127
Mataji is not a brahmin,

00:18:08.253 --> 00:18:10.722
so they don’t want to have the program there."

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:13.164
This was too much for them, to take upon themselves,

00:18:13.189 --> 00:18:17.085
So they said, "No, no, no, no. If you have published
it in the newspaper, let's have the program."

00:18:17.296 --> 00:18:19.780
So I said, "I start the speaking",

00:18:19.963 --> 00:18:22.132
and I just say spontaneously

00:18:22.266 --> 00:18:27.103
I said, "Please come forward those who are boothing that
the real brahmins."

00:18:27.621 --> 00:18:29.798
Four, five of them, you see walked.

00:18:30.112 --> 00:18:34.317
Of course, I mean, in India you don’t find
people of this kind, normally.

00:18:34.429 --> 00:18:36.465
They don’t challenge a seat normally.

00:18:36.536 --> 00:18:41.517
So they came forward and sat down
and their hands where shaking, like this. You see.

00:18:42.105 --> 00:18:45.483
So I said,"Now, if you are real brahmins,why are you shaking?"

00:18:45.661 --> 00:18:47.171
"You should not shake before Me."

00:18:47.289 --> 00:18:50.668
They said, "Mother we are shaking because you are Shakti,
You are the power."

00:18:50.745 --> 00:18:52.104
"That's why we are shaking."

00:18:52.241 --> 00:18:54.133
I said, "No, nobody is shaking here."

00:18:54.354 --> 00:18:57.245
So they said, "No, but these three, four are shaking,
who are they?"

00:18:57.353 --> 00:18:59.678
I said, "Go and ask them. Who are they?"

00:18:59.789 --> 00:19:01.745
So, they went and asked, "Who are you?"

00:19:01.825 --> 00:19:05.684
They said, "We are certified lunatics, coming from lunatic asylum,

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.226
our doctor has brought us

00:19:07.293 --> 00:19:10.387
that because one of us was cured by Mataji,
so we are here."

00:19:10.467 --> 00:19:13.851
Let's us see. There is no difference between those
lunatics and you.

00:19:13.992 --> 00:19:16.916
You’re shaking the same way and they’re also shaking.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:21.175
So, this fanaticism is making you shake.

00:19:23.213 --> 00:19:28.477
And this is the main point is, that when you become the truth,

00:19:28.637 --> 00:19:31.721
you start understanding the absolute nature of truth.

00:19:31.833 --> 00:19:34.905
There is no another, for truth.

00:19:35.263 --> 00:19:38.798
If this is so, this is so. If this is so, this is so.

00:19:38.921 --> 00:19:40.737
You cannot compromise.

00:19:40.891 --> 00:19:44.026
You cannot make it little different,

00:19:44.188 --> 00:19:45.887
you cannot synthesize it.

00:19:46.062 --> 00:19:50.638
You cannot analyze it. It is so, it is so, it is so.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.926
And you get confirmed about it, when you

00:19:54.037 --> 00:19:57.953
growing in your awarness,
you start finding out that this is the truth.

00:19:58.436 --> 00:20:03.569
So, you understand the truth through your mental activity first,

00:20:03.715 --> 00:20:07.908
through your rationality is goes in to your logic
and then you start accept it.

00:20:08.265 --> 00:20:12.005
But third thing that happens to you, ist the best of all.

00:20:12.121 --> 00:20:16.740
Is the third thing that you see the whole world as fun.

00:20:17.189 --> 00:20:19.842
You see the whole world as a big joke.

00:20:20.007 --> 00:20:23.116
You see the whole world as a witness.

00:20:23.244 --> 00:20:25.873
Like a thougth rises within us and falls off,

00:20:25.993 --> 00:20:28.044
and another thought rises and falls off.

00:20:28.132 --> 00:20:30.181
When we are on the waves of the thought,

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:34.540
we are frighten, we have fear, we have worries,
we have jealousies and all these things.

00:20:34.755 --> 00:20:37.108
But supposing you get into the boat,

00:20:37.291 --> 00:20:40.214
then you start watching waves with fun.

00:20:40.397 --> 00:20:44.075
in the same way, you jump onto such an awareness

00:20:44.163 --> 00:20:48.127
where you start watching the whole thing as a joke.

00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:50.424
As a fun, as a play.

00:20:50.551 --> 00:20:54.045
And the whole thing becomes a play to your mind, you start seeing.

00:20:54.194 --> 00:20:57.164
And then the joy, stars pouring in you.

00:20:57.443 --> 00:21:01.684
Like you all say that, Mona Lisa painting is very good.

00:21:02.082 --> 00:21:03.202
How do you know?

00:21:03.362 --> 00:21:05.267
Why should wait about Mona Lisa?

00:21:05.581 --> 00:21:09.581
She is not one of these modern women.

00:21:09.768 --> 00:21:14.015
She is a very old fashioned woman, quite plump.

00:21:14.103 --> 00:21:17.763
And why do you say that that painting is so beautiful?
What is so much about it?

00:21:17.904 --> 00:21:22.047
Now, if you are a realized soul, you can see it gives vibrations.

00:21:22.476 --> 00:21:24.361
It soothes your Spirit.

00:21:25.083 --> 00:21:27.259
That's why, it is the best.

00:21:27.523 --> 00:21:29.284
If you go to the Sistine Chapel,

00:21:29.487 --> 00:21:32.606
of the Vatican.

00:21:32.883 --> 00:21:36.451
What Michelangelo has done is nothing,
but he has created vibrations,

00:21:36.532 --> 00:21:38.352
tremendous vibrations.

00:21:38.501 --> 00:21:40.831
And you see Christ, how they are show Christ?

00:21:40.973 --> 00:21:43.083
A robust, tall

00:21:43.208 --> 00:21:46.034
fellow standing there, throwing people here and there.

00:21:46.118 --> 00:21:48.058
This is, what is happen today.

00:21:48.201 --> 00:21:49.999
This is the time of judgement.

00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:54.064
and the whole thing is nothing but the Kundalini they've shown,
and at agnya chakra

00:21:54.144 --> 00:21:57.759
Christ is sierving there and throwing people
this side and that side.

00:21:58.315 --> 00:22:00.770
This is what it is. He is depicted there

00:22:00.865 --> 00:22:03.939
through His own understanding, because was a realized soul.

00:22:04.063 --> 00:22:05.504
He shows it very clearly.

00:22:05.638 --> 00:22:08.814
But then on the altar you find a lanky panky

00:22:08.941 --> 00:22:12.777
Christ, you see, absolutely like a TV  patient about to die,

00:22:12.883 --> 00:22:17.988
only the bones, you see covered with the what you call a skin.

00:22:18.173 --> 00:22:22.174
How can Christ be like that! Is silly [INAUDABLE] .

00:22:22.868 --> 00:22:25.768
Like these people who try onces to carry the cross.

00:22:25.903 --> 00:22:28.501
And they will know that He could no be like that.

00:22:28.643 --> 00:22:32.111
He could not be such a lanky panky. He is a Person of Joy,

00:22:32.262 --> 00:22:35.855
health, happiness and exuberance.

00:22:35.917 --> 00:22:40.839
How can be anyone who is a man of God, is sickly,

00:22:42.749 --> 00:22:51.017
agitated, hot temper and horrible looking.
He has to have that serene on his face.

00:22:51.172 --> 00:22:58.535
He has to have that beautiful soothing, impression on others.

00:22:58.699 --> 00:23:06.521
How can it be that a person who is such a
great incarnation came on this earth

00:23:06.618 --> 00:23:09.436
to be a bony structure like that?

00:23:09.557 --> 00:23:11.002
This is what it is.

00:23:11.066 --> 00:23:15.592
We have such misconceptions about all of them, such misconceptions,

00:23:15.709 --> 00:23:18.667
and we want to put all this conception on God,

00:23:18.715 --> 00:23:21.050
but you cannot conceptualize.

00:23:21.585 --> 00:23:27.106
The thing that stands between you and yourself is your ego,

00:23:27.392 --> 00:23:32.318
an your conditiion. Both things stand against, theiy are like barriers.

00:23:32.524 --> 00:23:36.974
When this Kundalini rises, as you see here. Is not here.

00:23:37.141 --> 00:23:42.010
When she rises and crosses over this center.
(Yogi: I didnt put a chart...)

00:23:42.565 --> 00:23:49.510
Then what happens your ego and superego,
it represents your conditioning, is sucked in.

00:23:49.899 --> 00:23:55.398
When it is sucked in, that is the, that is the center of Christ,
when is awaken within you,

00:23:55.517 --> 00:23:58.846
He sucks in. That's the place where He is at the cross.
Tomorrow,

00:23:58.926 --> 00:24:03.596
I think they’ll bring the chart and I'll be able
to explain in more details.

00:24:03.729 --> 00:24:10.856
And that is the time when you are neither the ego nor the superego
and you become the self. The joy starts singing [INAUDABLE].

00:24:10.951 --> 00:24:12.880
Whole thing is joy.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.424
The joy starts coming in you.

00:24:15.861 --> 00:24:18.627
The all other pursuits are joyous.

00:24:18.843 --> 00:24:21.422
There is no joy in the whole things,

00:24:21.758 --> 00:24:27.069
and joy doesn't have duality like happiness or unhappiness.

00:24:27.237 --> 00:24:29.943
Happiness comes to you when your ego is pampered.

00:24:30.106 --> 00:24:33.987
And unhappiness comes to you,
when your conditionings troubles you.

00:24:34.229 --> 00:24:36.741
But, joy has no duality.

00:24:36.901 --> 00:24:41.983
It's just a feeling of complete elevated soul.

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:48.450
You feel completely elevated about everything else,
enjoy the bliss of God.

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.749
Actually, if you see, I mean

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.640
Mona Lisa's painting even

00:24:52.768 --> 00:24:55.950
you feel the joy is pouring, just like torrential rain.

00:24:56.318 --> 00:25:02.980
The person who did it, must have been the one
who has felt that joy, has broughten.

00:25:03.322 --> 00:25:08.218
But, if there is a person who is always thinking,

00:25:08.464 --> 00:25:13.192
and trying to think it out, what should be done.

00:25:13.862 --> 00:25:21.636
Then, he doesn't get the joy at all.
You look at a thing, and there is a thought in between.

00:25:21.804 --> 00:25:23.545
It kills the joy completely.

00:25:23.665 --> 00:25:28.286
Supposing I am here and I see something beautiful here,
and I start thinking about it,

00:25:28.416 --> 00:25:31.362
then I start thinking, "How much it must have cost,

00:25:31.456 --> 00:25:35.666
how to insure it. What to do with it", but there is no thought.

00:25:35.877 --> 00:25:39.981
The complete creation of that beauty, flows inside you.

00:25:40.096 --> 00:25:41.216
Just like joy.

00:25:41.345 --> 00:25:45.393
And this is, what has to happen to you, if you become the spirit.

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:50.147
If it does not happen to you, don't believe in anyone.
Also me.

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:52.170
You should not beleive,

00:25:52.326 --> 00:25:57.987
into anything, unless and until you get your spirit
which manifest all this things.

00:25:58.194 --> 00:26:02.824
It has nothing to do with your intellectualizing, your
your analyses, or anything.

00:26:02.914 --> 00:26:05.956
It is something that you have within yourself. It's your own.

00:26:06.019 --> 00:26:12.813
It is within you, and you have to get it within yourself,
by your own achievements.

00:26:12.906 --> 00:26:17.871
In the sense your own Kundalini rises and touches here
and opens it out.

00:26:18.096 --> 00:26:21.669
Now, as I told you, what I do is a simple thing.

00:26:22.304 --> 00:26:29.257
That I enlighten and alight, which is ready

00:26:29.346 --> 00:26:33.810
which is a, which is again in turn, becomes enlightened

00:26:33.897 --> 00:26:36.067
and can enlighten other light.

00:26:36.383 --> 00:26:39.039
Now, this Dr. Warren who was here, you have seen.

00:26:39.188 --> 00:26:41.288
He came to Me with his friend.

00:26:41.581 --> 00:26:45.226
and he just telephoned to Me, had nothing,
had just the telephone number.

00:26:45.396 --> 00:26:48.842
and when he telephoned to Me, he came to Me,
he got his realisation

00:26:48.962 --> 00:26:52.980
and he must have given realization in thousands.

00:26:53.223 --> 00:26:57.006
In the same way, you can also give realization to people.

00:26:57.268 --> 00:27:00.531
That’s how we can spread the knowledge,

00:27:01.191 --> 00:27:03.155
that is reality.

00:27:03.501 --> 00:27:06.871
knowledge of God's law's,

00:27:07.126 --> 00:27:14.168
of Divine mechanism within us, how it works.

00:27:14.891 --> 00:27:21.300
It is not, that everyone can get it.

00:27:21.483 --> 00:27:26.224
I must say that, that I do not say that
all off you will get it.

00:27:26.544 --> 00:27:32.319
But should get it. That's my desire is, if you get it,
you're very fortunate

00:27:32.894 --> 00:27:36.030
you have found, what you have been finding it.

00:27:36.435 --> 00:27:40.906
And if you don’t get it, I would say that I'll try again.

00:27:41.267 --> 00:27:44.547
It has to happen to you,

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:47.773
and that, it should happen in a way

00:27:47.949 --> 00:27:54.740
that it becomes part and parcel of your central nervous system
that you can manouver it.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:00.396
So, I have to tell you one thing. The One who has created us,

00:28:00.534 --> 00:28:05.457
is anxious that you enter into His Kingdom,

00:28:05.575 --> 00:28:08.396
and enjoy the bliss of His truth.

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:11.676
May God bless you. I would like you

00:28:11.788 --> 00:28:14.663
to ask me questions. But not like the way yesterday it happened.

00:28:14.766 --> 00:28:18.347
People said that,"Mother don't ask to him to ask questions,
because as soon as

00:28:18.437 --> 00:28:22.541
they, you asked them to ask questions,
they start behaving like devils."

00:28:22.655 --> 00:28:25.232
There is no need to be aggressive with Me.

00:28:25.326 --> 00:28:28.457
What is the need? I have come here to give, what is your own.

00:28:28.528 --> 00:28:33.870
Why should you be angry with me?
I just don't understand, the psychology.

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:38.334
I have not come to take away anything from you.
(Yogi: I think they are outside

00:28:38.787 --> 00:28:42.195
Yogi: They are not in here)
All right. Ask your questions please.

00:28:42.602 --> 00:28:48.471
(Someone is asking a question to Shri Mataji. But it's not clear.)

00:29:02.191 --> 00:29:03.775
What is he say?

00:29:04.619 --> 00:29:07.512
He said, just just a moment, he said that,

00:29:07.647 --> 00:29:11.934
as you have said, [INAUDABLE]  universal and

00:29:12.518 --> 00:29:16.998
that it is reality, but everybody is concept
the reality may be different.

00:29:17.139 --> 00:29:18.982
Yes, it is so. I know that.

00:29:19.392 --> 00:29:23.828
It is too, that the concept has to be different, isn't it?

00:29:24.442 --> 00:29:26.863
Has to be different because

00:29:27.388 --> 00:29:32.595
everybody has their own brain,
to understand, and thinking to their brain.

00:29:33.058 --> 00:29:35.149
But when you become the reality,

00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:39.070
then there is no more concept, this reality is sucked.

00:29:39.892 --> 00:29:45.585
Because you start working through your consciousness,
through your central nerves system.

00:29:45.731 --> 00:29:49.940
It is no more a concept, it becomes the reality itself.

00:29:50.365 --> 00:29:56.174
That's true that it has to be different,
naturally, I understand that.

00:29:56.289 --> 00:29:59.394
I don't mind having them different concept,

00:29:59.466 --> 00:30:03.627
but, don’t believe in your concept.
Because it has given no results.

00:30:04.902 --> 00:30:09.404
It has shown no result so far, that's all.

00:30:11.887 --> 00:30:13.887
Yogi: Concept is dissolved.

00:30:13.912 --> 00:30:18.041
Concept is dissolved. Yes that is what's happened,
concept is dissolved. This is the reality.

00:30:18.113 --> 00:30:21.187
For example supposing, I'm not  seeing this

00:30:21.578 --> 00:30:24.477
church and some people say that's in a church

00:30:24.525 --> 00:30:28.163
I may have some funny concept about church.
I have not seen it. All right?

00:30:28.263 --> 00:30:34.781
when I come and I see it for myself, and I know this it is so.
I have no concept, I know what it is, it’s like that.

00:30:35.057 --> 00:30:39.766
Simple, very it's common sense,
I tell you, it is really common sense.

00:30:39.979 --> 00:30:43.497
Actually will be shocked how people live in concepts.

00:30:43.775 --> 00:30:47.727
Sometimes i'm really surprised how they are build upon their

00:30:47.918 --> 00:30:50.918
lives after  lives of  falsehood.

00:30:52.021 --> 00:30:57.510
It's a really surprising, but they live
because you see, ego likes the myth.

00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.482
It wants to live with myth.

00:30:59.578 --> 00:31:03.278
Like Hitler believing that they are superior race. Imagine.

00:31:03.562 --> 00:31:08.104
He kill millions and millions of people with that kind
of a myth that he had in his head

00:31:08.223 --> 00:31:13.627
Like so many thinks he is the greatest religious man in that God,
it's going to put him in his throne

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:19.442
It’s true, you see. You see the effects
of this concepts everywhere.

00:31:22.689 --> 00:31:25.310
The problem is, the concept only

00:31:25.469 --> 00:31:28.556
that's the main problem why we're fighting.

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:33.075
Now, see. Let one by one, right please.

00:31:33.232 --> 00:31:37.512
Now, who? One this side, one this side.

00:31:42.645 --> 00:31:48.242
"He’s asking you to speak about the love and compassion
of the divine Mother. And her qualities."

00:31:48.361 --> 00:31:51.134
Now, This is embarassing. Isn't it?

00:31:51.813 --> 00:31:54.712
How can a Mother talk about her love?

00:31:55.076 --> 00:31:58.134
You can judging by the Mother Earth.

00:31:58.876 --> 00:32:02.209
Mother Earth has the capacity, who nourishes.

00:32:03.085 --> 00:32:06.096
She has a capacity to soothe us.

00:32:06.402 --> 00:32:10.513
She has a capacity, to sustain all that we do,

00:32:10.761 --> 00:32:12.596
how cruel we have been with her.

00:32:12.752 --> 00:32:17.486
First of all, we commit all kinds of sins, we do all kind of
wrong things on her back.

00:32:18.079 --> 00:32:20.486
Then we extract.

00:32:20.724 --> 00:32:26.993
For our stupid ideas of having all kinds of things of extracting.

00:32:27.346 --> 00:32:29.951
Still, she doesn't say anything.

00:32:30.435 --> 00:32:32.945
She doesn't bother about those things.

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:36.791
But sometimes if you go to far with her,
then she punishes.

00:32:37.074 --> 00:32:41.112
She does punishes. Like you have earthquakes,
you have  many things like that.

00:32:41.375 --> 00:32:43.807
But she has a very special capacity,

00:32:44.022 --> 00:32:47.438
which is in Sanskrit described as the "Tambara".

00:32:47.605 --> 00:32:51.222
Means, by which she creates seasons to please us.

00:32:51.488 --> 00:32:53.825
To make us happy. That innocence,

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:58.203
creation of seasons that she has. You see the flowers,
you see the everything

00:32:58.307 --> 00:33:04.382
how she makes a life so beautiful humanes, so joyful.

00:33:04.637 --> 00:33:10.372
That thing is 'pragya' means the knowledge which is enlightened.
When you get that knowledge,

00:33:11.472 --> 00:33:14.268
then you are amazed how [INAUDABLE]  she is.

00:33:14.562 --> 00:33:17.628
How she looks after little, little,

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:20.551
and how she soothes.

00:33:21.436 --> 00:33:26.477
And I do quite some thimes [INAUDABLE]  how I try to console people.

00:33:26.705 --> 00:33:28.360
In my own symbol.

00:33:28.552 --> 00:33:33.869
One day,there is a very great saint living in a mountain

00:33:34.023 --> 00:33:37.533
who I think, his legs and hands are broken and all disappear

00:33:37.679 --> 00:33:40.594
he lives in a cave, some like a monch.

00:33:40.858 --> 00:33:45.440
And, he can not move, so got a tiger so he can move.

00:33:45.648 --> 00:33:49.189
And I told the people I must see him, he is my son.

00:33:49.275 --> 00:33:53.096
They said " Mother, you don't like these gurus.
Why you want to see him?

00:33:53.188 --> 00:33:55.033
That time, he is real one.

00:33:55.181 --> 00:33:58.288
They said, "How will you ??",
I said, "Feel his vibrations."

00:33:58.415 --> 00:34:01.942
They said "Yes, lot's of vibrations."
I went to see this gentlemen.

00:34:02.198 --> 00:34:07.580
Now, he is a very evolve personality
and he can control the rain.

00:34:07.758 --> 00:34:12.924
So when I was going up the hill, it started raining heavily

00:34:13.067 --> 00:34:15.616
and he was very angry with the rain.

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:18.928
Actually he felt that, "Whats happen, this rain is

00:34:19.041 --> 00:34:21.136
completely drenching my Mother.

00:34:21.408 --> 00:34:24.058
She is coming up, and I can't even control this rain.

00:34:24.079 --> 00:34:26.960
What will she think. I sit here and she has to come up to see me."

00:34:27.056 --> 00:34:30.178
Because, he has broken legs and broken hands.

00:34:30.535 --> 00:34:33.367
And when I went to talk to him, He was sitting

00:34:33.508 --> 00:34:37.102
on a little stone and just doing like this, with anger.

00:34:37.384 --> 00:34:39.850
So, I just smiled at him and sat.

00:34:39.906 --> 00:34:46.244
Then he came, he said, "Is it that you control my ego,
who did all this that you make

00:34:46.287 --> 00:34:52.039
this place like this. You come to my house
and I can not welcome you properly?"

00:34:52.178 --> 00:34:55.395
I said, "No at all, why you get angry?

00:34:55.509 --> 00:34:58.177
I know you have bought a sari for Me,

00:34:58.349 --> 00:35:03.919
and I don't take a sari from a sanyasi,
becouse I'm [INAUDABLE] , I'm the one who has a household.

00:35:04.043 --> 00:35:07.823
Then how will I get a sari
unless and untill this sari is not drenched.?"

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:11.533
The whole thing become such a sweet thing. Really.

00:35:11.713 --> 00:35:13.806
He forgot his all temper and everything.

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.038
"How do you know Mother, I have a sari for you?"

00:35:16.179 --> 00:35:19.986
"I know you bought a sari for Me,
so I have to change it and how will I change"

00:35:20.056 --> 00:35:24.299
So, the whole thing soothe down and he was normal.
But I said [INAUDABLE] .

00:35:24.588 --> 00:35:30.018
I'm permeating, and the whole place must be drenched.
This is, is the joy of loving.

00:35:30.143 --> 00:35:34.549
So, why you should felle bad about it?
And that is how you soothe down.

00:35:34.948 --> 00:35:38.987
So, the mothers love is such, that She

00:35:39.112 --> 00:35:41.448
soothes you, she knows your problems,

00:35:41.574 --> 00:35:43.653
she knows that you make mistakes.

00:35:43.832 --> 00:35:46.395
Like, I tell you about Mr. Warren,

00:35:46.481 --> 00:35:50.200
one of his stories. When he ..... he can tell one after another.

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:54.879
One day, I was in Singapore
and we are going to have a program.

00:35:55.066 --> 00:35:59.114
So, I said, "We go about six o clock.
It's all right becouse I have to see somebody

00:35:59.208 --> 00:36:00.896
Why do you have to go

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:06.598
They said, "No, no, we must go make arrangements
another lady who was organising even very much more worried.

00:36:06.723 --> 00:36:09.570
So, they have decided, we must go to the hall.

00:36:09.671 --> 00:36:14.504
I said, "I'm go out and wait for [INAUDABLE] ."
But they just thought, better go.

00:36:14.663 --> 00:36:16.672
So, they took a

00:36:16.906 --> 00:36:21.753
plane two hours earlier and went to the place of organizing.

00:36:22.877 --> 00:36:30.351
When, I were there, I saw that when my car
reached there, their car also reached there they just came down at that time

00:36:30.492 --> 00:36:32.006
And I knew why it happened,

00:36:32.092 --> 00:36:35.092
I said, "All right come drive a but, they feel very embarrassing"

00:36:35.155 --> 00:36:37.027
Becouse they came with such a

00:36:37.105 --> 00:36:41.722
determination that they have to reach there,
and same time I arrived there.

00:36:42.433 --> 00:36:45.691
So, I went draw walk, when I came back

00:36:45.972 --> 00:36:48.582
they said, "Mother we are sorry."

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.083
I said, "What happen?

00:36:50.317 --> 00:36:52.228
They said,"We reached there, all right.

00:36:52.408 --> 00:36:56.955
but from the airport to this place,
there was such a bad jam, they have never see.

00:36:57.291 --> 00:36:59.580
So, we thought we better drive through the

00:36:59.689 --> 00:37:03.025
sideway, so we got stucked into the mud.

00:37:03.172 --> 00:37:05.830
Then we start pulling the car out.

00:37:05.931 --> 00:37:09.228
and all our clothes were dirty,
then we had a very bad time.

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:12.189
And we have arrived, after You have arrived.

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:13.767
I said, "It's all right."

00:37:13.907 --> 00:37:18.259
Now, we never do such a thing Mother,
we should have coming with you. It was a mistake.

00:37:18.376 --> 00:37:20.863
So, like that litle little things

00:37:21.065 --> 00:37:23.213
Mother teaches you, how to be

00:37:23.378 --> 00:37:25.488
all right, how to be on the right path.

00:37:25.644 --> 00:37:30.495
But it is never a big pinch, never a big
punishment. Because you are children.

00:37:30.675 --> 00:37:33.774
So, here this life by which
you should advanced

00:37:33.867 --> 00:37:36.163
you should go further, you should be encouraged.

00:37:36.265 --> 00:37:41.805
But if you ego get's pampered, and you think
I am a great Sahaja Yogi. There are many who behaving like that

00:37:42.001 --> 00:37:44.852
And then they have this correction point.

00:37:45.064 --> 00:37:50.641
That's how it works out. And gradually I find,
people come up very sweetly understanding

00:37:50.711 --> 00:37:53.735
that we should not try to

00:37:53.946 --> 00:37:57.712
do things which are no all right.
And we should try to do something

00:37:57.790 --> 00:37:59.860
that is helpful, which is very collective.

00:37:59.969 --> 00:38:03.345
And that's what it is, and it works in a such a beatiful manner

00:38:03.454 --> 00:38:08.813
that you don't have to should to anyone,
or to do anything. Whole thing works out beautifully.

00:38:09.041 --> 00:38:14.028
The blessings are so great like Krishna has said (in Hindi)

00:38:14.122 --> 00:38:16.450
He says, when yoga takes place

00:38:16.849 --> 00:38:20.084
then, "kshema" - that means

00:38:20.357 --> 00:38:23.021
the well-being of a person [INAUDABLE] .

00:38:23.232 --> 00:38:25.138
Even material you are [INAUDABLE] .

00:38:25.279 --> 00:38:28.234
in so many ways. Is very suprising, is [INAUDABLE] .

00:38:28.625 --> 00:38:34.524
You are helped in material in so many ways. There was a girl,
a little girl about ten years. She wrote to Me,

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:38.987
But I am dying to see you.
How can I come to India, I have no money to travel

00:38:39.483 --> 00:38:43.444
And she wrote a letter to Me.
I just get the letter and I didn't answered her.

00:38:43.601 --> 00:38:45.997
And eight years later she had a field day

00:38:46.161 --> 00:38:49.471
in her school. So she took a trinket from her house

00:38:49.565 --> 00:38:54.369
just to sell it in the field. So the teachers said,
"This is real gold, how can you sell this here?"

00:38:54.478 --> 00:38:57.229
She couldn't believe.
She went to her mother, she said

00:38:57.395 --> 00:39:00.981
This trinket of our house, is real gold.
She couldn't believe either

00:39:01.067 --> 00:39:05.568
So they wen to the goldsmith,
and goldsmith said "Yes, it is."

00:39:05.787 --> 00:39:06.936
It is gold.

00:39:07.099 --> 00:39:15.817
And he valued with the price which he wanted to buy was exactly
the same as they would have to pay for their travel both of them.

00:39:16.551 --> 00:39:19.200
So, it is in such a sweet manner.

00:39:19.509 --> 00:39:23.043
You see, you must know, a loving mother
when you are asleep

00:39:23.168 --> 00:39:24.787
she looks after you.

00:39:25.037 --> 00:39:26.982
When you awake, she looks after you.

00:39:27.115 --> 00:39:31.794
But she doesn't show that you are someting

00:39:32.005 --> 00:39:33.294
more then others,

00:39:33.528 --> 00:39:36.826
better then others. She doesn't like
you to have your ego.

00:39:36.936 --> 00:39:38.755
but she wants that you to share.

00:39:38.951 --> 00:39:40.841
Share your love with everyone.

00:39:41.239 --> 00:39:46.221
That's the greates joy for Me
to see when the Sahaja Yogis meet each other.

00:39:46.455 --> 00:39:48.126
When they would, you should see

00:39:48.275 --> 00:39:50.205
How they  meet and

00:39:50.283 --> 00:39:55.008
how they hold each other to themselves.
Just pure love and pure understanding.

00:39:55.086 --> 00:39:56.682
Is the greatest thing to see.

00:39:56.784 --> 00:39:58.684
I'm happyyou asked such a nice question

00:39:58.777 --> 00:40:04.787
but I feel rather embarassed, because
it is realy so great to enjoy your love from everyone.

00:40:04.896 --> 00:40:06.896
May God bless you.

00:40:08.227 --> 00:40:10.618
Yogi: this fire by Adi Shankara...

00:40:11.007 --> 00:40:20.976
Ah, you must read Adi Shankaracharya to know the love of God,
love of Mother. I mean he was a child, a beautiful child.

00:40:21.325 --> 00:40:25.647
Even Christ has said, "behold the mother".

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:27.975
Behold the mother.

00:40:28.459 --> 00:40:29.897
It's very significant.

00:40:34.381 --> 00:40:36.076
Is water in this.

00:40:42.701 --> 00:40:45.314
Should have a Realization.

00:40:47.453 --> 00:40:50.203
Yogi: Ok. So we have it now?

00:40:51.578 --> 00:40:54.515
Have I answered your all questions, this side?

00:40:54.881 --> 00:40:58.858
Just on,  All right.

00:41:02.621 --> 00:41:05.059
Loudly please.

00:41:05.219 --> 00:41:06.703
Yogi: loudly!

00:41:38.177 --> 00:41:41.370
Yogi: She's refereing to the, how you said

00:41:41.581 --> 00:41:44.222
how you would you recognise Christ you referd to that.

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:46.636
So she raises the question,

00:41:46.985 --> 00:41:49.831
what is your idea, your theorie

00:41:50.112 --> 00:41:55.095
your concept on Christ, will he be coming on a white horse

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:57.520
is he going to come and is this going to happen.

00:41:57.633 --> 00:42:00.984
Yes, this is going to happen. No doubt!

00:42:01.306 --> 00:42:03.836
[INAUDABLE]  that's a fact.

00:42:04.125 --> 00:42:08.126
Yes, but that doesn't going to give any [INAUDABLE].

00:42:08.345 --> 00:42:11.142
He's not going to ask you any questions.

00:42:11.392 --> 00:42:13.407
He's not to going to give any answer.

00:42:13.539 --> 00:42:18.305
No realization, nothing. Just [INAUDABLE]

00:42:18.423 --> 00:42:21.194
He has eleven powers of destruction

00:42:21.334 --> 00:42:24.524
is called as ekadesha. Once he arrives

00:42:24.702 --> 00:42:29.087
you will have no place to hide your faces if you are [INAUDABLE]

00:42:29.138 --> 00:42:32.058
[UNCLEAR]  ....right now

00:42:32.229 --> 00:42:34.784
at this moment.

00:42:34.955 --> 00:42:39.877
Otherwise [INAUDABLE]  . Is a fact, no doubt. [INAUDABLE]

00:42:43.089 --> 00:42:45.743
[UNCLEAR]

00:42:48.563 --> 00:42:53.941
Becouse that's what you ???
I don't want to ??? It's a fact.

00:42:59.458 --> 00:43:02.005
That will be last [INAUDABLE]

00:43:05.573 --> 00:43:08.862
Already he has startet working in us

00:43:08.955 --> 00:43:12.589
All [INAUDABLE]  are also what Krishna has said

00:43:13.074 --> 00:43:18.991
According to Sahaja Yoga there are eleven destroying powers.

00:43:19.071 --> 00:43:23.975
They are here, which we call as ekadesha rudra.

00:43:24.168 --> 00:43:30.747
And when people get any [INAUDABLE]  disease, all this centers [INAUDABLE] .

00:43:31.425 --> 00:43:36.210
So, the destruciton now [INAUDABLE].

00:43:36.397 --> 00:43:40.614
You did not get [INAUDABLE] .

00:43:46.716 --> 00:43:53.263
Yogi: One more and this is the last. Yes

00:43:54.505 --> 00:44:02.264
a visitor is asking a question, but it is not audible

00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:24.352
Yogi: I'm sorry, I can't...
would you please stand and just say it again.

00:44:24.969 --> 00:44:27.476
Shri Mataji: Make it short.
Yogi: make it briefly.

00:44:31.984 --> 00:44:34.760
Yogi: the idea of [INAUDABLE].

00:44:35.221 --> 00:44:37.720
that one soul [INAUDABLE]  another soul

00:44:37.954 --> 00:44:42.673
Visitor: not clear

00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:58.161
Yogi: I think you have a, another concept about healing

00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:59.984
but let's finalise it

00:45:00.102 --> 00:45:08.091
Yogi: She is talking about a healing process, and
is there any particular way, we should do this.

00:45:08.349 --> 00:45:12.045
No, no. You should never bother about the source

00:45:12.202 --> 00:45:13.354
[INAUDABLE]

00:45:13.503 --> 00:45:19.089
Christ has said that, leave
them alone they have nothing to do with [INAUDABLE]

00:45:19.543 --> 00:45:23.278
Living souls you would say, or death souls?

00:45:23.531 --> 00:45:25.000
Yogi: living

00:45:25.185 --> 00:45:31.675
living. Now the living soul,
they not talk to another soul unless there [INAUDABLE]  spirit.

00:45:32.135 --> 00:45:37.626
At that level you need to speek
to each other on a very different language.

00:45:37.799 --> 00:45:40.442
The language is different, the style is different

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:44.005
and the communication is different.
The whole priority changes.

00:45:44.083 --> 00:45:46.130
You become a different person.

00:45:46.325 --> 00:45:47.622
All right?

00:45:48.294 --> 00:45:54.273
That the egg becomes a bird, and
the birds have a different language among themselves.

00:45:54.453 --> 00:45:56.016
Yogi: That's fine she's happy.

00:45:56.125 --> 00:46:00.289
She's happy about it. All right.

00:46:02.258 --> 00:46:04.453
All right.
Yogi: Ok, that's it Mother.

00:46:04.789 --> 00:46:08.406
All right, are you all satisfied?

00:46:09.039 --> 00:46:11.844
Now, just one or two more. All right.

00:46:12.092 --> 00:46:14.609
Four, ah that for me...
Yogi: One of the men.

00:46:14.671 --> 00:46:17.541
All right. [INAUDABLE]

00:46:17.738 --> 00:46:22.248
Question: What is a death soul?
It just acts as a death soul or living soul?

00:46:22.631 --> 00:46:24.271
What did he say?

00:46:24.904 --> 00:46:28.544
Yogi: What if a death soul is acting like a living soul?

00:46:29.724 --> 00:46:32.864
Oh, it's a very big question my child.

00:46:32.935 --> 00:46:37.427
I'll tell you later on, after the program. All right.
It [INAUDABLE]  my lecture. Doesn't matter.

00:46:37.552 --> 00:46:38.748
[INAUDABLE]

00:46:38.959 --> 00:46:44.210
We are made of [INAUDABLE], all right. And then is
Kundalini within us and also the spirit.

00:46:44.436 --> 00:46:49.078
Now, if a death sould [INAUDABLE]

00:46:49.211 --> 00:46:52.976
What happens, that the earth element [INAUDABLE]

00:46:53.125 --> 00:46:54.874
water element also comes out

00:46:55.031 --> 00:46:57.031
the rest of the trhee element remain

00:46:57.158 --> 00:47:00.455
and the spirit and the Kundalini means top of that.

00:47:00.713 --> 00:47:04.002
And that is the death soul. And the living soul with a person

00:47:04.143 --> 00:47:07.166
which has got the spirit, and thinks that is a soul,

00:47:07.314 --> 00:47:10.003
I don't know [INAUDABLE]

00:47:10.194 --> 00:47:12.823
But [INAUDABLE]  person,

00:47:13.034 --> 00:47:21.137
who is living, has got a spirit, has
got a Kundalini and has got a ....

00:47:21.356 --> 00:47:24.354
Yogi: 5 elements
Shri Mataji: also the, all five elements.

00:47:24.471 --> 00:47:28.588
representing in those centers. But

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:31.315
when he becomes a realized soul,

00:47:31.393 --> 00:47:34.496
then he is not as a

00:47:34.691 --> 00:47:39.684
living soul.
But he's called as an enlightened soul.

00:47:43.456 --> 00:47:46.837
Visitor is asking a question.

00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:10.714
Yogi: She's peda grow on her own.
She has lot of

00:48:11.183 --> 00:48:15.988
good experiences, but she' also had a lot of pain.
Is an nessesary experience

00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:18.058
that she should have the pain?

00:48:18.238 --> 00:48:20.542
No, not nessesary at all.

00:48:20.683 --> 00:48:22.527
Actually you got some good experiences.

00:48:22.676 --> 00:48:24.402
[INAUDABLE]

00:48:24.590 --> 00:48:29.201
The good experience should not [INAUDABLE]

00:48:29.334 --> 00:48:34.006
Now, what is the experience you get first of all.
You get the coole breeze coming out of your head.

00:48:34.279 --> 00:48:35.537
On the very gross level.

00:48:35.779 --> 00:48:39.928
And out of you head and there should
bee cool breeze you should feel arround.

00:48:40.272 --> 00:48:42.678
Then the second experience we should have is

00:48:42.811 --> 00:48:45.717
that you should be peaceful with yourself.

00:48:45.827 --> 00:48:49.633
Absolutely silent, and there is no problem at all.

00:48:49.851 --> 00:48:53.946
And, if you get any pain. Suposing
after Realization also

00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:57.133
you might be some sort of [INAUDABLE]

00:48:57.242 --> 00:49:00.860
as soon as put your hand there you can get rid of that pain.

00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:06.102
So, it is the experience that you have had,
should be an experience [INAUDABLE]

00:49:06.555 --> 00:49:09.985
And, if it a person who has given you realization,

00:49:10.126 --> 00:49:13.086
you [INAUDABLE]

00:49:13.484 --> 00:49:15.797
You see, this is a [INAUDABLE]

00:49:16.062 --> 00:49:20.056
the guru that give you realization,
that makes you an expert.

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:23.400
Visitor talks, bu it's not clear.

00:49:28.017 --> 00:49:32.002
[INAUDABLE]

00:49:32.205 --> 00:49:36.158
Yogi: She wasn't just refering to phycical pain,
she was refering to

00:49:36.518 --> 00:49:39.712
pain in face up to life and so.

00:49:40.329 --> 00:49:42.009
Be in what?

00:49:42.306 --> 00:49:45.416
Yogi: pain in facing up to life's problems and wider

00:49:45.713 --> 00:49:47.548
meaning of her pain.
Shri Mataji: All right.

00:49:47.728 --> 00:49:51.212
That must stop, that must stop completely.

00:49:51.532 --> 00:49:54.228
Becouse you start to see the whole thing

00:49:54.884 --> 00:50:00.572
as a drama. You are so detached see the
whole thing. You solve the problem.

00:50:00.736 --> 00:50:02.511
You see the things,

00:50:02.699 --> 00:50:05.014
if you become,

00:50:05.374 --> 00:50:08.577
the spectator of the whole drama,

00:50:09.077 --> 00:50:11.842
and you know that you can cure

00:50:11.998 --> 00:50:15.342
you don't feel the pain. You get [INAUDABLE]

00:50:17.178 --> 00:50:20.546
All rigth? May god bless you!
Yogi: Ok, let's have it.

00:50:20.874 --> 00:50:25.562
All right. One more [INAUDABLE]

00:50:25.648 --> 00:50:29.569
What is it?

00:50:29.968 --> 00:50:37.501
Visitor is asking: I have two questions, actually.
What is your feeling [INAUDABLE]

00:50:37.846 --> 00:50:42.524
Yogi: What is the base of cause of disease?

00:50:43.266 --> 00:50:45.266
Is inbalance.

00:50:45.407 --> 00:50:49.576
Tomorrow I'm going to thell you all about. Is inbalances.

00:50:50.248 --> 00:50:53.091
Yogi: Second.
Shri Mataji: Second one?

00:50:53.434 --> 00:50:56.193
Visitor...

00:50:56.529 --> 00:50:58.241
I'm not [INAUDABLE]

00:50:58.437 --> 00:51:02.116
If that is Shri Sai Nath. He gives it perfectly all right

00:51:02.257 --> 00:51:06.798
[INAUDABLE]

00:51:07.392 --> 00:51:12.321
[INAUDABLE]

00:51:13.493 --> 00:51:15.222
[INAUDABLE]

00:51:15.683 --> 00:51:18.019
Yogi: Can you speek about carma?

00:51:18.246 --> 00:51:20.815
Ah. The carma a [INAUDABLE]  thing.

00:51:20.995 --> 00:51:24.714
but actually, what you do [INAUDABLE]

00:51:25.027 --> 00:51:28.714
is activated with you ego.

00:51:29.378 --> 00:51:32.151
And when the Kundalini rises,

00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:33.769
when She

00:51:34.058 --> 00:51:36.058
passes through this center

00:51:36.417 --> 00:51:40.159
that is sucked in. That's why it has said, Christ

00:51:40.377 --> 00:51:42.347
forgive us [INAUDABLE]

00:51:42.745 --> 00:51:47.206
since he's taking our work, he died for our sin.

00:51:47.487 --> 00:51:50.161
In the sense that carma is sucked by Him.

00:51:50.552 --> 00:51:51.654
And we

00:51:51.919 --> 00:51:54.240
are left without an ego,

00:51:54.358 --> 00:51:57.568
and it is only the ego that has [INAUDABLE]

00:51:57.912 --> 00:52:02.583
Once the ego is sucked in there is no carma left.

00:52:06.302 --> 00:52:08.302
[INAUDABLE]

00:52:09.958 --> 00:52:11.388
All rigth.

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:15.732
Now, let's ask one more question,
all right? They are anxious

00:52:15.998 --> 00:52:17.639
to have we the experience.

00:52:17.873 --> 00:52:20.859
Please ask. One question more.

00:52:21.483 --> 00:52:24.078
Visitor: You mean we create karma?

00:52:24.812 --> 00:52:27.219
Yogi: Do you mean that, do we create karma?

00:52:27.399 --> 00:52:28.562
Yes, we do!

00:52:28.828 --> 00:52:30.789
Where we do action,

00:52:30.937 --> 00:52:31.937
you see,

00:52:32.086 --> 00:52:36.965
karma is only the myth that human beings have. Animals don't have.

00:52:37.277 --> 00:52:39.958
They don't have this problem. The problem is

00:52:40.114 --> 00:52:43.739
when ego [INAUDABLE]  of you head,

00:52:43.864 --> 00:52:45.965
then we develope a personality.

00:52:46.083 --> 00:52:49.950
Which is I. I'm Mr. so, I'm Mrs.

00:52:50.169 --> 00:52:51.872
The I ness we develope.

00:52:52.098 --> 00:52:56.965
When we develope I'ness,
we think that we are uniques. This is a big [INAUDABLE]

00:52:57.333 --> 00:52:59.262
Like a, I give a

00:52:59.356 --> 00:53:02.684
an expample from the villagers [INAUDABLE]

00:53:02.794 --> 00:53:05.301
that you don't have to take to much luggage

00:53:05.465 --> 00:53:06.911
on an aeroplane.

00:53:07.279 --> 00:53:09.991
So, they sat in the aeroplane

00:53:10.101 --> 00:53:12.436
and they put all their luggage on their heads.

00:53:12.561 --> 00:53:15.131
and the said, "Now we should lessing the weight.

00:53:15.239 --> 00:53:19.579
of the aeroplane. It is something like that with our karma.

00:53:19.861 --> 00:53:23.197
That we take the responsibility of doing the work.

00:53:23.393 --> 00:53:26.852
Why we [INAUDABLE]  , you see [INAUDABLE]

00:53:26.977 --> 00:53:28.117
Is all there.

00:53:28.359 --> 00:53:31.797
[INAUDABLE]  said, so we mak them ???. All right.

00:53:31.977 --> 00:53:35.258
Death from the death to the death. That's all we do.

00:53:35.532 --> 00:53:37.266
We make [INAUDABLE]

00:53:37.711 --> 00:53:39.711
We make this, we make that

00:53:39.812 --> 00:53:43.461
and then we start using matter for our comfort.

00:53:43.578 --> 00:53:46.899
And then, matter sits on our head. We can't get rid of it.

00:53:47.415 --> 00:53:50.555
Our spirit is supressed becouse of the matter.

00:53:50.883 --> 00:53:52.570
And then we have to

00:53:52.789 --> 00:53:55.688
use the matter, otherwise we just can't exsist.

00:53:56.102 --> 00:53:59.547
So, what we are doing is, we are creating death after death.

00:53:59.907 --> 00:54:02.672
But, not the scenery we [INAUDABLE]

00:54:02.836 --> 00:54:06.477
We can not transform one flower to a fruit. Can we?

00:54:06.751 --> 00:54:07.992
We can not do it!

00:54:08.303 --> 00:54:13.788
So, what ever is done is done by
God Allmighty, By His living powers.

00:54:14.194 --> 00:54:20.647
Whatever being is all there [INAUDABLE]

00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:27.547
Yogi: Ok. Let's everyone slip their shoes off.

00:54:27.961 --> 00:54:30.594
So, let's us do make the better contact with the Earth.

00:54:30.829 --> 00:54:33.610
Shri Mataji: What is ....?
yogi: and put your hands up.

00:54:35.696 --> 00:54:38.891
Yogi: So, they recording?

00:54:40.748 --> 00:54:44.438
Yogi: Be comfortable, sit with your hands on your lap.

00:54:46.501 --> 00:54:51.420
When Shri Mataji asks, just close the eyes.

00:54:54.957 --> 00:55:01.332
Speaking every day....

00:55:01.871 --> 00:55:05.834
Yogi: All that you do at this stages, be hungry for it!

00:55:06.186 --> 00:55:08.506
And do ask hungry for it in you heart.

00:55:08.733 --> 00:55:11.959
Please Mother, give me my realization!

00:55:12.233 --> 00:55:16.482
Becouse you have to desire it.
And that's where She can not cross your freedom.

00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:20.235
If you don't want it, then as She says you are free to go.

00:55:20.532 --> 00:55:21.774
But if you wanted

00:55:21.923 --> 00:55:24.617
put your hands up and ask humbly in your heart

00:55:24.796 --> 00:55:27.414
"Please Mother, give me my realization".

00:55:27.859 --> 00:55:29.859
We have to humble us all down.

00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:35.262
Now, we have to put our hands just like this.

00:55:36.262 --> 00:55:38.798
Yesterday I told you, day before,

00:55:38.923 --> 00:55:45.310
that left hand presents, our desire
and the right hand our action.

00:55:46.927 --> 00:55:51.440
So we have to [INAUDABLE]  put it in you lap,

00:55:51.573 --> 00:55:54.026
like this. With your finger stretched,

00:55:54.143 --> 00:55:57.120
and sit comfortable. That's very important to sit comfortable.

00:55:57.261 --> 00:55:59.708
[INAUDABLE]

00:55:59.865 --> 00:56:03.333
Shoes go back, ounder the chair,

00:56:03.466 --> 00:56:05.856
and put your feet straight. Like this.

00:56:06.036 --> 00:56:09.848
On the ground, not teaching each other.

00:56:13.082 --> 00:56:15.311
Put the left hand on your lap,

00:56:16.473 --> 00:56:18.108
and the right hand

00:56:18.366 --> 00:56:22.225
[INAUDABLE]  put the both of your hands on your lap.

00:56:22.623 --> 00:56:24.452
And now, close your eyes.

00:56:24.882 --> 00:56:28.327
Now, don't open you eyes till I tell you.

00:56:28.538 --> 00:56:30.608
Becouse Kundalini want rise

00:56:31.045 --> 00:56:34.756
[INAUDABLE]  something has to happen within.

00:56:34.951 --> 00:56:37.522
So, just keep your eyes

00:56:38.093 --> 00:56:39.702
completely closed

00:56:39.906 --> 00:56:41.906
till I tell you.

00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:46.694
Now, put your right hand

00:56:49.545 --> 00:56:51.545
on your heart.

00:56:51.842 --> 00:56:55.038
on the lefhand side and press it.

00:56:56.226 --> 00:56:58.584
Now, you are the Spirit,

00:56:58.779 --> 00:57:01.045
and the Spirit resides in your heart.

00:57:01.436 --> 00:57:05.048
So, you have to just ask a questions three times.

00:57:05.712 --> 00:57:08.595
Mother, am I the spirit?

00:57:08.759 --> 00:57:10.759
Just ask, in a humble way,

00:57:11.025 --> 00:57:12.759
and full confidence.

00:57:12.907 --> 00:57:16.181
Mother, am I the spirit?

00:57:20.063 --> 00:57:25.196
Please don't feel guilty. That is one thing
I'm requesting, not to feel guilty at this moment.

00:57:25.290 --> 00:57:29.376
Forget the past, just forget the past.

00:57:52.622 --> 00:57:55.962
Now, keep the right and, left hand as it is

00:57:56.126 --> 00:57:57.774
bring the left hand down.

00:57:57.884 --> 00:58:00.619
on you stomach, on the lefthand side.

00:58:00.697 --> 00:58:05.416
to the center which is of the Primordial master.

00:58:05.768 --> 00:58:08.299
right hand sorry, left hand towards Me

00:58:08.417 --> 00:58:12.361
left hand. Sorry I made a mistake, left hand towards Me.

00:58:13.986 --> 00:58:17.478
And right hand the stomach and press it hard.

00:58:17.681 --> 00:58:21.338
Press it hard on your lefthand side of your stomach.

00:58:21.745 --> 00:58:25.705
Put the right hand on the lefthand side of the stomach.

00:58:27.126 --> 00:58:33.266
At this point, you have to say with full confidence

00:58:33.697 --> 00:58:37.369
Mother, I'm my own guide.

00:58:37.666 --> 00:58:40.314
Mother, I'm my own guru.

00:58:40.439 --> 00:58:43.650
Mother, I'm my own master.

00:58:44.673 --> 00:58:46.673
With full confidence.

00:58:50.219 --> 00:58:52.219
Try to sit comfortably.

00:59:06.215 --> 00:59:09.713
Now, this has to be said ten times.

00:59:09.893 --> 00:59:14.306
Because we have ten benances.
Human beings have to ten benances.

00:59:14.431 --> 00:59:16.830
So, we have to say ten times.

00:59:34.406 --> 00:59:38.456
Now, please put your right hand again to nurish,

00:59:39.073 --> 00:59:41.073
on your heart.

00:59:43.205 --> 00:59:45.916
Here you now assert

00:59:46.096 --> 00:59:49.994
by saying "Mother, I am the spirit."

00:59:52.596 --> 00:59:55.064
Please say, twelve times.

00:59:56.689 --> 01:00:01.158
To assert, without feeling guilty. Without feeling guilty.

01:00:01.315 --> 01:00:04.801
Without feeling guilty, you must assert

01:00:06.535 --> 01:00:07.660
and

01:00:07.926 --> 01:00:12.024
Mother, I am the spirit.

01:00:25.975 --> 01:00:27.975
Twelve times, please.

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.920
Please don't feel guilty.

01:00:38.193 --> 01:00:41.123
Next thing could be to put your right hand on the

01:00:41.248 --> 01:00:45.123
base of your neck, on your shoulder on the lefthand side.

01:00:45.365 --> 01:00:46.685
Right hand.

01:00:47.229 --> 01:00:51.443
From front, on the left hand side.

01:00:52.861 --> 01:01:00.249
Here, you hold it tight. From the front you take your hand [INAUDABLE].

01:01:01.394 --> 01:01:05.568
And hold it tight. Here we say "Mother,

01:01:06.155 --> 01:01:11.861
I'm not guilty, please say sixteen times, please say it.

01:01:14.266 --> 01:01:18.002
It's too much...

01:01:25.611 --> 01:01:28.030
Please say it with

01:01:28.176 --> 01:01:33.089
all your understanding that, "Mother, I'm not guilty".

01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:17.263
Now, put your right hand across your forehead.

01:02:17.968 --> 01:02:22.597
Across your forehead at this one you have to say,

01:02:22.668 --> 01:02:26.145
"Mother, I forgive everyone."

01:02:26.596 --> 01:02:31.739
Please say "Mother, I forgive everyone."

01:02:41.737 --> 01:02:46.470
It is very easy to say, just say and it will workout.

01:02:52.196 --> 01:02:57.979
Now, put your right hand
on the back of your head. Hold it tight.

01:02:58.218 --> 01:03:01.384
If the know the optic loop, where it is placed,

01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:03.641
on the back of your head.

01:03:04.013 --> 01:03:10.817
At this point, you have to now say
without feeling guilty, you have to say

01:03:10.902 --> 01:03:15.347
that is, If I have done any mistakes,
"Oh Lord please forgive me", that's all.

01:03:15.378 --> 01:03:19.207
But don't feel guilty.
Please don't feel guilty, don't count them,

01:03:19.333 --> 01:03:22.935
just say that "Please forgive me."

01:03:23.771 --> 01:03:26.756
From your heart.

01:04:20.129 --> 01:04:23.547
Now, put your hand on the top of your head.

01:04:23.662 --> 01:04:27.662
Put it just on top, your hand your palm should touch

01:04:27.773 --> 01:04:33.420
the fontanel bone area,
where you have a soft bone in your childhood.

01:04:33.512 --> 01:04:37.734
And press it, and try to move it clockwise.

01:04:37.868 --> 01:04:43.137
Now, at this point as a said,
I cannot cross your freedom and

01:04:43.453 --> 01:04:48.836
you have to ask for your realisation, otherwise I cannot force it.

01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:51.482
Then just say seven times

01:04:51.588 --> 01:04:56.056
Mother, I want my realisation.
Please give me realisation.

01:04:56.839 --> 01:04:59.022
Seven time.

01:05:08.224 --> 01:05:10.476
Shri Mataji blows...

01:05:51.171 --> 01:05:54.659
Now, raise your hand and seek if there is a cool breeze coming in.

01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:14.801
Now, change your hand please.

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:18.660
Put your right hand down,
and the left hand on top of your head.

01:06:18.732 --> 01:06:21.584
And now see, [INAUDABLE] .

01:06:53.170 --> 01:06:55.383
You got it, most of you.

01:06:56.052 --> 01:06:58.464
All can raise both your hands.

01:06:58.796 --> 01:07:04.700
On top of your head,
open your eyes. Please take m higer, higher.

01:07:05.699 --> 01:07:08.405
And now ask a question, in your heart.

01:07:08.468 --> 01:07:11.653
Is this the wind of the Holy Ghost?

01:07:11.871 --> 01:07:13.616
Is this the Brahmachaitanya?

01:07:13.779 --> 01:07:19.842
Is this the call pervading power of love of God's all living work?

01:07:35.815 --> 01:07:37.672
Now feel it yourself.

01:07:41.629 --> 01:07:46.395
Those who are proper on second time, must have definitely felt it.

01:07:46.528 --> 01:07:51.599
But I tell you today what is
to done tonight and work it out would be better.

01:07:51.969 --> 01:07:55.215
You may get a photograph [INAUDABLE].

01:07:55.425 --> 01:07:59.825
In the beginning, is better to use my
photograph because it has got vibrations.

01:07:59.935 --> 01:08:06.498
Now what you can do is the put a candle in front of the photograph, and you can see the vibrations are coming from the photograph.

01:08:06.570 --> 01:08:10.181
Now, put the left hand towards photograph
and the right hand like this, just now you can do it

01:08:10.233 --> 01:08:12.812
put the left hand towards me at the right hand like this.

01:08:12.961 --> 01:08:15.555
Now this is the balance. This is the balance [INAUDABLE]

01:08:15.648 --> 01:08:19.593
Put left hand towards Me, and right hand out like this at the back.

01:08:19.704 --> 01:08:22.283
You see like this so we are [INAUDABLE]

01:08:22.536 --> 01:08:26.003
All right. Now see on the left hand if it is coming.

01:08:33.696 --> 01:08:37.005
You're all thoughtless, if you see that.

01:08:39.426 --> 01:08:44.124
Now, you put your right hand towards Me and your left hand up.

01:08:47.217 --> 01:08:48.762
Heart.

01:08:50.465 --> 01:08:52.846
You have to believe that you are the spirit.

01:08:52.967 --> 01:08:54.391
that's all we believe,

01:08:54.488 --> 01:08:58.000
Your believe in yourself. Tthat's all we have to believe in

01:08:58.517 --> 01:09:01.072
that you are the spirit.

01:09:06.349 --> 01:09:07.714
Good?

01:09:09.195 --> 01:09:14.729
All right. Then I teach you how to raise
your Kundalini tonight when you go home.

01:09:15.034 --> 01:09:17.859
So this is what you can do on the photograph

01:09:17.974 --> 01:09:20.481
and you can see that it starts moving

01:09:20.669 --> 01:09:25.312
from both your hands. At the most of very much, sort of intention

01:09:25.449 --> 01:09:29.024
and If you are very sick, then you can take a

01:09:29.525 --> 01:09:34.027
little bowl of water with little salt in it, and put your feet in

01:09:34.537 --> 01:09:38.489
that bowl and take the vibrations from the photograph.

01:09:38.691 --> 01:09:43.580
But if you feel cool breeze in your hand and
cool breeze moving in this hand. Then everything is perfect.

01:09:43.721 --> 01:09:45.951
Now you have to learn, tomorrow I'll tell you

01:09:46.132 --> 01:09:50.295
what it means how to use it,
how to become a master. Is a simple thing.

01:09:50.507 --> 01:09:54.428
Now today, I teach you how to raise
your own your Kundalini . Which is your own.

01:09:54.663 --> 01:09:58.162
Now put your left hand in front of the Kundalini, here.

01:09:58.388 --> 01:10:01.578
All of you sitting down.
Can you see me? Put your left hand like this.

01:10:01.637 --> 01:10:06.412
Just like this in front. Like this in front. This hand like this.

01:10:07.142 --> 01:10:08.911
The right hand has to be moved

01:10:09.123 --> 01:10:13.493
up, front, down, back. Like that clockwise.

01:10:13.789 --> 01:10:17.936
We have to raise. Now, let us raise our Kundalini. Start it moving,

01:10:18.194 --> 01:10:21.789
slowly, like this, like this, like this.

01:10:22.039 --> 01:10:28.175
Throw your hands up, absolutely lose and then give it a twist.

01:10:28.981 --> 01:10:32.284
Throw your head back, and now give it a knot.

01:10:33.296 --> 01:10:36.859
That's one, we have to do it trice. Again let's do it!

01:10:37.137 --> 01:10:41.073
Hold the hand in front and start moving it.

01:10:46.493 --> 01:10:49.524
Take it up through your hands and

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:52.369
just give it a twist and here it is.

01:10:52.568 --> 01:10:55.695
Third time we have to give give three twist.

01:10:56.454 --> 01:10:59.033
You can do it at home.

01:11:02.624 --> 01:11:04.444
Throw  back your hands

01:11:04.687 --> 01:11:08.607
head and hands loose, and give it one,

01:11:09.484 --> 01:11:11.745
then the second one,

01:11:12.551 --> 01:11:17.844
and then the third one like this. Now see if you ???

01:11:29.078 --> 01:11:33.469
Now, that's one thing more one must learn, how to give

01:11:33.845 --> 01:11:36.939
protection to your aura? That is very important!

01:11:37.197 --> 01:11:39.299
Protection to your aura, I wish

01:11:39.445 --> 01:11:42.873
people knew how to do it,
they would have saved themselves in many troubles.

01:11:43.052 --> 01:11:46.059
Iis to put your left hand like this.

01:11:46.801 --> 01:11:49.126
And with the right hand you move it

01:11:49.332 --> 01:11:53.196
Like this, from here. Move it, one

01:11:54.871 --> 01:11:58.450
Go back. Two.

01:12:02.795 --> 01:12:05.328
Is Three,

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:09.564
Four

01:12:13.173 --> 01:12:15.323
Five

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:18.680
Six

01:12:21.977 --> 01:12:23.097
Seven

01:12:24.583 --> 01:12:31.030
This is how you give protection to yourself. Now, see you vibrations.

01:12:34.057 --> 01:12:35.930
All right? Is better.

01:12:36.176 --> 01:12:39.588
Now, what happens that when you are judging other’s vibrations,

01:12:39.722 --> 01:12:44.111
you can just start judging like this,
it's all right. Or giving bandage like this.

01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:46.767
bandage of love. Because it is felt your hands

01:12:46.868 --> 01:12:48.503
when you move your hands actually

01:12:48.665 --> 01:12:51.601
the powers is flowing to, through your hands [INAUDABLE].

01:12:51.738 --> 01:12:53.325
So watch your manouvering

01:12:53.472 --> 01:12:57.170
So you give it a bandhan, like you have a [INAUDABLE].

01:12:57.379 --> 01:12:59.601
like that to him, and then sit the vibrations.

01:12:59.763 --> 01:13:02.064
Now, if you want to see your own vibrations

01:13:02.217 --> 01:13:06.557
you give yourself a bandhan like
this, and then see your own rubbish.

01:13:08.687 --> 01:13:13.845
You try tonight. Don’t talk too much
about it, don't argue. You are beyond mind.

01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:16.120
And that’s why I don’t argue about it.

01:13:16.425 --> 01:13:18.877
The becoming is the most important part

01:13:19.087 --> 01:13:21.626
that it is the difficult part of Sahaja Yoga.

01:13:21.786 --> 01:13:24.023
It is like no other thing that

01:13:24.115 --> 01:13:28.162
here, unless and until become it is of no use. You have to become

01:13:28.486 --> 01:13:34.949
then you have to grow, then you
have to become the expert, ultimately the master.

01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:38.228
That’s what it is. And for whrich you can not pay.

01:13:38.455 --> 01:13:40.275
May God bless you.

01:13:45.484 --> 01:13:50.643
Yogi: [INAUDABLE]  Tomorrow night program is here.

01:13:51.377 --> 01:13:52.908

01:13:53.027 --> 01:13:55.994

01:13:56.176 --> 01:14:02.223
Please give your address and telephone
number. We’ll contact you to let you know the followup meetings.

01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:07.836

01:14:08.715 --> 01:14:14.843
We’ll see you tomorrow night. Good evening.

01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:34.959
Those who want to meet Shri Mataji tomorrow evening,
She will spare a few minutes to meet you all. Tonight

01:14:35.062 --> 01:14:38.525
She’s just come back from San Diego, and rather tired.

01:14:38.581 --> 01:14:40.753
So, tomorrow evening it will be a good chance.

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:45.400
She’ll spend some time with you all here after the program.

01:14:46.211 --> 01:14:48.312
Yogini: [INAUDABLE]  Shri Mataji some tea?

01:14:48.422 --> 01:14:51.453
Yogi: No, no let's go.

01:14:51.937 --> 01:14:53.617
How are you?

01:14:53.882 --> 01:15:00.470
Shri Mataji: Lookin fine.
"I assume so." [INAUDABLE]

01:15:17.192 --> 01:15:23.065
Someone: It's shameful what She said.
Yogi: We will do something. Thank you very much.

01:15:38.332 --> 01:15:41.699
Anybody going to the seminar at the weekend?

01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:46.715
Would you be kind enough to just have
a word with Brian Bell, who’s standing here with his hand up.

01:15:46.901 --> 01:15:50.737
Because you may be able to help
with transport arrangements for other people.

01:15:50.852 --> 01:15:51.982
It’s a long way

01:15:52.083 --> 01:15:57.149
Brian will deal with those people
going to the seminar, who may be able to help with transport.
