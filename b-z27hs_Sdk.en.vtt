00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.880
The fear comes from left-side.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.520
So the most were the dominated people and few were dominating.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.240
This is the reason.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.920
Most were the people who were dominated and few were dominating

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.840
and out of fear, they created fear .

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.600
So now Sahaj Yogis should have no fear.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.480
Nobody is going to dominate.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.040
Let’s come out.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.960
No fear of any kind. Alright? That is first theory.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.840
You have achieved this much today.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:03.360
No fear of anyone in this world. Even of God because he loves you.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:10.640
One should not work anything because you are afraid of me, I hate that idea. No!

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.800
Because I love you.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.200
Very much

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.000
No fear of any kind.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.760
In this totality a world has to be created of people, by the people,

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:42.520
who have no fear. This fear has to be given up.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.360
Behind all this nonsensical nervousness is fear.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.960
So for that, what She does is to give Abhaydaan

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.720
Under Her protection you are beyond fear, you are protected.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.360
But if you do not want to believe in yourself,

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:11.160
and you don’t believe into Her protection, then no body can help you,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.480
because everything is mythical for you.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.720
In every venture that we take up we should not have any fear

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.480
because God is with you. Is a fact, is the truth. You just try.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.400
But when you try through your ego you fall into the trap of fear.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.680
because when a person who is egoistical tries to dominate others

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.000
he sees himself in the mirror and thinks

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.760
that the other person will dominate him.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.440
That’s how this fear creeps in, into our minds,

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.880
and we start getting all kinds of these stupid tantrums

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.160
out of this mythical fear.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.240
The fear is created by our ego.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.840
A person who has no ego, he’ll have no fear

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.480
because he has not harmed anyone. Why should he have any fear?

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.800
And such a man, or such a woman, will be looked after by God,

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:23.960
because God takes over. When you surrender your ego to God He takes over.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.560
But those who have ego He says, “All right, go ahead,

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.040
use your ego, try to protect yourself, cut your throat.”

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.040
if you believe that God is Almighty and you are connected with God,

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.960
then why should you have any fear of anything?

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.840
Love each other; respect each other; respect yourself

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.280
and all the time say one mantra within yourself

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.600
“I am a Sahaja Yogi.”

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.440
It says everything about your responsibilities,

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.880
what are your aspirations, what you are.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.560
You are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.400
Being reborn by Adi Shakti Herself.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:23.480
Now the name of your Mother is very powerful.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:37.520
You know that is the most powerful Name than all other names, the most powerful mantra.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.720
But you must know how to take it.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.400
With that complete dedication you have to take that Name.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.800
Not like any other name.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.760
You know that in India when take the name of Guru,

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.080
they pull their ears for taking the name of the Guru.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:07.640
Means, “While taking the Name if I am making any mistakes, please forgive me” - means that.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:14.880
This mantra is a very powerful mantra.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:23.520
Only what you need is the dedication, the dynamite of dedication.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.120
Just the Name;

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.880
which means Nishkalanka, which means Nirmala,

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.960
which means completely without any mala.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.360
What is this, mala? Is this mire.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.880
Without any mire. Nih. Absolutely.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.920
The joy at the Sahasrara is called as Nirananda, since long.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.880
Since ancient times called Nirananda or Nirmalananda.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:11.800
So many call it as Nirmalananda or Nirananda.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:19.080
That joy is the joy that you enjoy even when you get crucified.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.760
That joy, you enjoy even when you are poisoned.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.840
Even on your deathbed, you enjoy that joy.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.920
That joy is Nirananda.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.920
So be prepared for the second phase.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.680
You are in the front.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.000
It’s very little time I need.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:58.120
But I need really people with steadfast wisdom and dedication; steadfast.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:07.280
Even for a second it should not go this side or that side.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:19.720
Then, we can progress faster, we can go ahead to fight the battle.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:28.880
So, first of all, you should not have any fear about anything.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.160
If you have done nothing wrong,

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.080
if you are on the right path, you will be always protected.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:41.000
Now remember this: you will be always protected.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.280
Remember this and believe in this,

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.440
that, "I am always protected".

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.880
This is something very difficult,

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.840
because perhaps our mind gives ideas,

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:59.640
"Oh God, what will happen now; what is going to happen? This thing, that thing".

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.680
So, first and foremost thing, as I said,

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:09.800
is to be fearless - to make the Goddess express Herself.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.320
Another thing, a child doesn’t have any fear.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.200
A child doesn’t have any fear.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.440
Ganesha has no fear at all.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.800
In the same way you should have no fear, no fear at all, no fear.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.120
As long as your Mother is with you why should you have any fear?

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.520
Fear of this, fear of that, “I am frightened."

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.640
“I can’t do this,” “I can’t do that." That children never do.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.840
They’ll try everything, if you tell them.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:45.520
You should have no fear. I don’t know what fear is.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.200
In the same way you should have no fear, no fear of anything.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.600
Nothing is going to go wrong with you. But don’t do wrong things.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.960
If you do wrong things it will repel, it will work out on you.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.000
But don’t do wrong things, be straight forward

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.240
and nothing can harm you, nothing can harm you.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.840
We have had so many experiences of this,

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.920
how everywhere laid down for you, everybody is looking after you.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
There are so many Deities who are working out things out for you.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.120
But you have to be, you have to be, extremely careful

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.240
that you do not develop this fear business.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.200
Because fear takes you to the Left side and once you go to the left side,

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.080
you know the problems of the Left side is. First of all, you go against Ganesha.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.880
Ganesha is standing at the base of the Left.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:38.120
And then you develop cancers, you develop all these things, fear, fear, fear

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.760
and emotional problems and all these things come.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.480
In emotions you should be bubbling with joy.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:50.280
Joy is your emotion.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.960
In action you should be thoughtless.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.760
And in ascent you should be surrendered.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.440
That’s all, it’s very simple, three mantras are very simple for children.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.120
They are like that.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.680
But there is one point

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.200
on which one should not be very sure:

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:25.400
that you have absolutely reached the last truth.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.480
You have to be careful on this point very much.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:34.640
I have seen people who go very high in Sahaja Yoga,

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:40.440
come up very high, and suddenly they go down very low.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:44.320
Makes Me very sad, extremely sad.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.920
The reason is that they have no faith

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:55.800
– faith in themself and faith in Sahaj.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.160
This is the faith which is missing.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:04.120
You have to have faith in yourself and faith in Sahaj.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:10.520
Sahaj means there is the divine Power,

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:18.680
and this all-pervading divine Power is looking after us.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:25.000
It is now felt also, you have felt it.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.280
It’s not that only by saying it’s there

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.680
– you have known that it is so.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.680
But even knowing that,

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.640
it has not become such a faith within you.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.840
But this is the faith about Christ has talked.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.400
This is the faith with an enlightened mind,

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.400
not the blind faith.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:48.520
And with the blind you might make mistakes,

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.600
while with the enlightened one if you have faith

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:58.200
you become extremely powerful, extremely powerful.

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.760
There cannot be any problems

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.280
if your faith is enlightened.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.320
So now, you see in Sahaja Yoga

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.800
many people who are very steady,

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.120
who are upright,

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.040
who are very valuable.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:25.920
They are like the people who know they are standing on the rocks.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.280
But those who are not yet so steady are the people,

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.760
they think they are still dwindling

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:39.800
on some sort of a funny waters of this life.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:46.120
The rocks have been there, you’re standing on the rocks;

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.640
and also that has come out of faith

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.280
that nothing can disturb us, that faith,

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.360
nothing can trouble us.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.040
As far as Christ is concerned, naturally,

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.080
I mean, He knew everything,

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.640
so He was sure about it.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.800
He never bothered, He never dwindled, He never doubted.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.760
He knew that, that He is the Son of God,

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.800
and that was the fact that He knew very well.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.920
And He never challenged it, He never doubted it, nothing.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.280
It is so.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:26.920
And that’s why He, I say, was standing on the rocks;

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.400
while the other people,

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.320
even Sahaja yogis,

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.920
have to become like Christ

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.440
as far as the faith is concerned.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:47.680
This faith is to be understood.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.840
This is an enlightened faith.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:55.560
Like Christ – He went into crucifixion,

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.480
He went into all kinds of things,

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:02.760
just because He knew it was just a drama

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:07.520
and He was doing all this just in a drama, playing;

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.360
and there’s nothing serious,

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.160
nothing is going to matter, and that He’s going to resurrect Himself.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.920
He played the drama.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.480
To Him it was nothing very serious.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:28.280
He saw people making fun of Him, mocking at Him.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:32.760
He also in His heart knew everything that

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:37.480
“These people who are mocking don’t know what I am.”

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.720
But at the same time,

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.960
He was the embodiment of faith:

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:50.880
faith in Himself

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:56.040
and in this all-pervading Power.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.800
This never lets you down,

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:04.280
but for that you have to have absolute faith.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:10.440
Supposing I have someone on whom I have faith,

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:15.080
naturally I will give him all the work,

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.680
I will trust everything,

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.080
I’ll keep the keys with him or the money with him,

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.480
never doubt such a person.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:31.480
In the same way if you have faith – faith in yourself,

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:39.040
faith in Sahaja Yoga where you are established

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:43.240
– you’ll be surprised how things will work out,

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.200
how life will improve

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:52.880
and you will be standing on the rocks, you’ll feel that way.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.560
You’ll have no doubts,

00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:00.400
you’ll have no problems, no diseases.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:07.640
So, this is such a state

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.840
– only with faith.

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.000
But now this faith, how do you get?

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:17.280
The problem is, how to get to this faith?

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.400
There’s no course about it,

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.560
there’s no literature about it,

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.200
there’s no lecture about it.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:30.000
But there is an awakening within you

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:34.760
which will ask this

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.400
“What am I?” – this awakening,

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.200
“What am I? What have I achieved?”

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:46.200
You see, this will question

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.120
“What is it that I have achieved?

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.840
What have I got out of Sahaja Yoga?”

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.920
All these questions will come to you.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.440
But if you have faith,

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.280
not the blind but the enlightened

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.840
which is established by many miracles in life,

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.640
many things in life;

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.520
small, small things you’ll find there have been miracles,

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.320
small, small things.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.760
There have been miracles even in big things,

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.920
in so many things where you never expected this will happen.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.960
So now you know, very well settled,

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:25.760
that you are now very nicely in Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.040
For example, it starts raining.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.560
Half of you would get worried about it why it’s raining,

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.280
but they will know that there’s a very beautiful roof,

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.120
nothing can happen.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.680
Let it rain as much as it likes.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:43.840
And then you’ll have faith that it is not going to rain,

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.840
it’s not going to drench us.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:51.400
In the same way this faith within us

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:55.840
has to be absolutely solid,

00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:00.200
and that makes you extremely strong

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.920
and makes you responsible

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.600
for the resurrection of thousands

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.840
and thousands and thousands and thousands of people.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.800
The other day, I met a lady.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:20.080
She told of a miracle in her life, how she was saved.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:25.720
She was about to die, she came across an accident, all kind...

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:30.160
But how she was saved, while her husband,

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.560
he succumbs to all kinds of things. So I said:

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.160
"What do you mean, how it happened?" She said:

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.840
"Mother, it's nothing but Shraddha!"

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:44.960
Shraddha is dedication, surrendering.

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:50.280
"Surrendering, because I'm surrendered!"

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:54.720
But I said: "How?" "That, I don't know, I'm just surrendered.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:20:01.080
I feel so comfortable, so lively and so much out of fear

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.440
when I know I'm surrendered,

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.560
completely surrendered to my Spirit!"

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.120
And this what it is what we have to learn

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.560
when we meditate, that we have to surrender.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.240
Muhammad has called "Islam". Islam means surrender,

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.400
though they don't surrender -otherwise you see...-

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:23.280
but what is that you must surrender

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:27.640
to your global nature, to your higher nature.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.840
You hold your breath three times.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:39.240
And think in your heart that I am the mother of the universe

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.000
That’s all! This will… This has to be corrected

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.160
That’s a problem there, that’s why.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.000
Unless and until you correct this problem, the attention,

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.640
but not only attention but kundalini goes there.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.680
So you have to correct that thing.

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.120
Which I noticed yesterday: you have a center heart

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:57.680
But you have come to SY now I mean a few days back

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.240
You’ll get corrected in no time. Alright?

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:08.840
They have to put your right hand towards the photograph,

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.880
the left hand here

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:19.400
And you have to hold your breath. All of you can do it.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.400
Hold your breath

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:26.080
And say: Jagadamba, Jagadamba, Jagadamba.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:30.280
You are holding the breath; so how can you say?

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.400
You have to think.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.720
Now leave it.

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:49.240
And then hold it once more.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.680
Put your left hand. Right hand towards Me.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:00.040
Good. Now leave it.

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.920
Again hold it.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:17.720
Now leave it. Alright?

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.000
May God bless you.
