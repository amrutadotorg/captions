00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:15.563
I’ll talk before and then at the time you
can just tell me what time it is.

00:00:15.764 --> 00:00:22.542
The radio is off? You can keep it till
eight o’clock and…

00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:45.940
So happy to wait on you.

00:00:52.758 --> 00:00:58.936
Today we are celebrating a day

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:06.678
which is a very, very important,

00:01:06.894 --> 00:01:12.588
absolutely the most important, we can say,
day,

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:19.346
when such a great happening took
place.

00:01:20.417 --> 00:01:25.161
And it had to take place that way –

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.090
it was all in a way destined.

00:01:41.211 --> 00:01:45.809
In my last lectures I have told you

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:54.734
how Christ was created first
in the heavens.

00:01:56.389 --> 00:02:05.980
In the Devi Mahatmya, if you read that,
He was created as Mahavishnu

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:16.280
and is mentioned very clearly, that first
He was created as an egg.

00:02:16.604 --> 00:02:23.784
It is written in this book, which perhaps
was written about 14,000 years back.

00:02:24.496 --> 00:02:29.059
It’s a book that predicts about Christ,

00:02:30.365 --> 00:02:35.247
and that is why people in the West,
specially,

00:02:35.448 --> 00:02:38.964
offer an egg to each other as a friend.

00:02:39.165 --> 00:02:45.256
The first existence came on this Earth
as an egg, that was Christ,

00:02:45.457 --> 00:03:00.056
and part of it was kept in that state
and the rest of it was used

00:03:01.062 --> 00:03:10.502
by the Holy Ghost, by Mahalakshmi,
to create Christ out of it.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.306
In that ancient book He was called
as Mahavishnu;

00:03:16.507 --> 00:03:19.626
means the greater form of Vishnu.

00:03:19.827 --> 00:03:22.860
But actually Vishnu is the father

00:03:23.061 --> 00:03:28.923
and He is the Son created by the Holy
Ghost.

00:03:29.124 --> 00:03:33.880
After my lecture I would like, if you have
the book, to read it out to them,

00:03:34.081 --> 00:03:39.023
the whole texts of how Christ was created.

00:03:40.062 --> 00:03:48.806
And when He was created, He cried
for His Father,

00:03:50.466 --> 00:03:54.362
as He cried also on the cross once.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:01.047
And He cried for years.

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:09.187
And then Christ, in Mahavishnu state
was blessed by His Father

00:04:09.388 --> 00:04:14.407
who said that, “Your position will be
placed higher than Mine.

00:04:14.608 --> 00:04:18.420
And You will be the Adhara,” means
the ‘Support of the Universe’.

00:04:18.621 --> 00:04:24.166
See, how from Mooladhara He becomes
the Adhara.

00:04:27.495 --> 00:04:32.566
This was all done at the heavenly stage -

00:04:32.775 --> 00:04:36.531
Vaikuntha stage you can say.

00:04:37.323 --> 00:04:43.272
Then He was given birth by the Holy Ghost,

00:04:43.473 --> 00:04:48.443
who was the mother of Christ on this
Earth,

00:04:48.644 --> 00:04:54.936
who was nobody else but was the incarnation
of Mahalakshmi; means She was Radha.

00:04:55.137 --> 00:05:01.420
Ra-dha. ‘Ra’ means energy, ‘dha’ means
the one who sustains the energy.

00:05:06.107 --> 00:05:11.272
There are many aspects of Easter one
has to understand,

00:05:12.536 --> 00:05:18.920
but the most of all is why did He die and
why was He resurrected?

00:05:19.121 --> 00:05:24.189
This point I have not yet touched, perhaps,
so clearly.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.663
That’s the point I want to tell you today.

00:05:27.864 --> 00:05:32.273
It’s only you people can understand
the importance of the life of Christ.

00:05:32.474 --> 00:05:41.206
And when it is said that you have to get
your realisation through Christ,

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:46.734
it means that He had to pierce through
the Agnya chakra.

00:05:46.972 --> 00:05:52.351
He had to be there. If He had not created

00:05:52.552 --> 00:05:58.169
this gap in the gate, we could never have
got realisation.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:04.956
That is why it is said that you are to pass
through

00:06:05.157 --> 00:06:14.254
the gates of heaven only with the grace
of Christ.

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:17.482
Of course, that doesn’t mean churches,
it doesn’t mean at all churches.

00:06:17.683 --> 00:06:21.091
That you understand as sahaja yogis that
you have to pass through the Agnya chakra.

00:06:21.292 --> 00:06:26.340
Ultimately that’s the most difficult point
where human beings have to pass.

00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:34.326
Because, at the Agnya chakra, your ego
and superego are fully grown.

00:06:34.527 --> 00:06:38.786
At the human stage only this ego
is developed.

00:06:38.987 --> 00:06:43.368
Now how to overcome the ego was a point.

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:50.574
And to overcome the ego, Christ had
to do this.

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:57.837
When He was created in the beginning
as Shri Ganesha -

00:06:58.837 --> 00:07:07.396
you know the story how He was created,
that the mala,

00:07:07.597 --> 00:07:18.008
is the - from the body of Parvati, the Holy
Ghost, was taken out,

00:07:18.209 --> 00:07:24.816
because before Her marriage, She was -

00:07:25.017 --> 00:07:32.521
She had to cover Herself for Her bath
with many scented things.

00:07:32.722 --> 00:07:37.726
And it was taken out, all these things,
and Her vibrations came out.

00:07:37.927 --> 00:07:41.748
And She created this child just to protect
Her chastity;

00:07:41.949 --> 00:07:47.664
outside Her bathroom She put him. And
you know the whole story about it.

00:07:47.865 --> 00:07:53.725
Now there was a part of the element
of the earth in that child.

00:07:53.926 --> 00:07:57.595
Pruthvi-tattwa, was there.

00:07:57.796 --> 00:08:09.458
All other centres - all other centres have
got some elements in them.

00:08:09.659 --> 00:08:15.291
Some elements like pruthvi-tattwa is there,
earth element;

00:08:15.492 --> 00:08:20.335
then you have got water element, then
you have got air element,

00:08:20.536 --> 00:08:29.696
and when you come to this it is the light
element, it’s the light.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:36.051
And at this point, at Agnya chakra,

00:08:36.357 --> 00:08:42.160
He had to cross the last element, that
was the light element.

00:08:42.361 --> 00:08:46.424
That means He had to come out into
the true form

00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:55.204
of only the Divine Power, the Omkara,
the vibrations you can call it;

00:08:55.405 --> 00:09:03.237
or the absolute -

00:09:03.438 --> 00:09:08.227
you call it logos or something like that?
The first sound, Brahma.

00:09:08.428 --> 00:09:11.739
So He had to become the principle
of Brahma.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.662
To become the principle of Brahma,

00:09:13.863 --> 00:09:18.706
He had to get rid of all other elements
within Him.

00:09:18.907 --> 00:09:25.124
So the last was also the light element,
which He had to cross through.

00:09:25.325 --> 00:09:30.359
So He had earth element in Him, as He
was of the mala,

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:35.534
and all other elements within Him.
But when it comes to the Agnya,

00:09:35.735 --> 00:09:39.392
He had to give up all the elements,
that He had to die

00:09:39.593 --> 00:09:42.375
the death of all these elements that were
within Him,

00:09:42.576 --> 00:09:47.819
to become complete, absolutely pure
Spirit.

00:09:50.391 --> 00:09:56.081
What He did on subtle form works out
on the gross form,

00:09:57.174 --> 00:10:04.850
and to do that He had to die. And
whatever died in Him,

00:10:05.051 --> 00:10:08.221
was that little element of earth element
and other elements,

00:10:08.422 --> 00:10:13.063
and what came out of Him was pure Spirit.

00:10:13.264 --> 00:10:16.123
[To somebody: “Just move forward.”]

00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:21.265
Was pure Spirit that was resurrected;
the pure Spirit,

00:10:21.466 --> 00:10:28.543
the pure Brahma-Tattwa which had formed
the body of Christ,

00:10:28.744 --> 00:10:32.922
which was the body of Christ.

00:10:35.705 --> 00:10:39.738
And this happening came -

00:10:39.939 --> 00:10:47.247
Christ has done what was predicted
about Him -

00:10:47.747 --> 00:10:54.506
that He is the saviour, because He passed
through that gate

00:10:54.707 --> 00:10:59.872
to take people from this bodily existence,

00:11:00.073 --> 00:11:06.289
means the one that depends on the elements,

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:10.094
to that existence which is Spirit.

00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:17.586
So the resurrection is where you become,
from your attention,

00:11:17.787 --> 00:11:22.393
you jump into the attention of the Spirit.

00:11:22.594 --> 00:11:29.916
When you feel your attention, when you
become the Spirit.

00:11:30.117 --> 00:11:38.322
That is the happening which has happened
to you also.

00:11:38.523 --> 00:11:45.155
But He became pure Spirit, pure Brahma
Tattwa when He was resurrected.

00:11:45.356 --> 00:11:54.729
And the resurrection is a happening
of the Divine Power

00:11:54.930 --> 00:12:04.413
which came from Mooladhara chakra as just
earth element, started growing.

00:12:04.614 --> 00:12:08.854
It took its birth from there, came up
to Agnya chakra.

00:12:09.055 --> 00:12:17.250
There Christ was created to pass through
all the elements,

00:12:17.451 --> 00:12:22.660
ultimately to enter into the Sahasrara

00:12:22.861 --> 00:12:28.321
to become a complete Brahma Tattwa.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:39.999
And this was a very difficult thing,
was very experimental.

00:12:40.208 --> 00:12:45.849
And the experiment was quite a dangerous
one.

00:12:47.391 --> 00:12:54.085
It could have failed also, because He had
in Him

00:12:54.317 --> 00:13:01.682
that human element, the body element
which suffered.

00:13:03.009 --> 00:13:09.118
And He suffered, because this body element
suffers, not the Spirit;

00:13:09.319 --> 00:13:13.154
Spirit does not suffer. The body element
suffers.

00:13:13.363 --> 00:13:23.532
So He had to suffer that body element
and to get over it, to get out of it.

00:13:25.339 --> 00:13:36.950
And to get out of it He had to have
a tremendous courage.

00:13:38.071 --> 00:13:43.378
It was such a difficult operation.

00:13:44.132 --> 00:13:47.706
Without Him nobody could have achieved.

00:13:47.907 --> 00:13:50.931
He knew it was predestined,

00:13:51.132 --> 00:13:58.765
but it was one of the most difficult things
to happen.

00:13:58.966 --> 00:14:05.002
I wonder how many Christians know
the significance of an egg.

00:14:05.203 --> 00:14:13.471
Now egg signifies a stage where you are
before realisation,

00:14:13.672 --> 00:14:20.987
when you are in your eggshell; that you
are Mr. X, you are Mrs. Y, all that.

00:14:21.188 --> 00:14:25.367
But when you mature fully inside,

00:14:25.568 --> 00:14:30.781
the bird is ready and that is the time
you are hatched.

00:14:30.982 --> 00:14:34.541
This is the time you get twice born.

00:14:34.742 --> 00:14:39.372
So, actually the resurrection of Christ
signifies that,

00:14:39.573 --> 00:14:45.276
and that’s why we give that egg to people
saying,

00:14:45.477 --> 00:14:52.202
“You are an egg”, a reminder of that, and
this egg can become the Spirit.

00:14:52.403 --> 00:14:56.700
And also it is written that it was an egg
when He came.

00:14:56.901 --> 00:15:03.993
First He was created as an egg. Half of it
remained as Shri Ganesha

00:15:04.194 --> 00:15:08.368
and half of it became Mahavishnu.

00:15:08.569 --> 00:15:14.429
Then He came on this earth and He departed
with all His elements

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:19.272
and the pure vibrations formed His body,

00:15:19.473 --> 00:15:27.534
and He remained there within all of you,
to be awakened.

00:15:27.735 --> 00:15:35.591
And when the Kundalini takes your attention
through that point,

00:15:35.792 --> 00:15:40.265
there you also become the Spirit.

00:15:40.589 --> 00:15:45.372
That’s why He said that, “I’m the gate,
I’m the door.”

00:15:45.573 --> 00:15:50.309
He didn’t say, “I’m the destination.”
He said, “I’m the door,”

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:54.069
because you cannot become Christ.

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:57.866
That’s why he didn’t say, “I’m the
destination,” that you have to achieve Him.

00:15:58.067 --> 00:16:03.499
But He has created this space for you.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:11.890
You can become spiritually awakened;
you can become your Spirit.

00:16:12.099 --> 00:16:17.617
But Christ is an incarnation, He was
the Son of God.

00:16:17.818 --> 00:16:23.380
And so He is an incarnation, and that
incarnation came on this earth

00:16:23.581 --> 00:16:32.378
just to pull you out of your elements,
to make you become the Spirit.

00:16:32.604 --> 00:16:39.284
Now how is it that it was the most
difficult thing?

00:16:39.485 --> 00:16:47.085
Because human beings have created in their
heads all kinds of artificial barriers.

00:16:47.286 --> 00:16:50.760
You see, whatever we think and whatever
we do with our mind

00:16:50.961 --> 00:16:54.769
is all dead, is man-made, is artificial.

00:16:54.970 --> 00:17:00.457
Because reality is beyond your mind;
it is not in your mind.

00:17:00.658 --> 00:17:03.151
You cannot conceive it; you cannot hold it.

00:17:03.352 --> 00:17:08.704
Whatever is in your mind is not
the reality, it is beyond.

00:17:08.905 --> 00:17:14.853
So, for a human being to accept something
that is beyond mind

00:17:15.054 --> 00:17:17.328
had become so difficult at the time
of Christ,

00:17:17.529 --> 00:17:19.994
because of Romans and all these people
coming up.

00:17:20.195 --> 00:17:23.770
And we are repeating the history again.

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:27.574
They were so ego-oriented, they were
so full of ego

00:17:27.775 --> 00:17:37.246
that to destroy their ego somebody had
to do this to create a passage.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.677
By His death so many things are proved,
that all those who crucified Him

00:17:43.878 --> 00:17:47.707
were stupid people, they were ego-oriented,
they were blind.

00:17:47.908 --> 00:17:51.154
They could not see what He was.

00:17:51.355 --> 00:17:56.920
They could not see what a genuine
personality He was.

00:17:57.121 --> 00:18:00.960
They crucified Him.

00:18:03.183 --> 00:18:07.847
I mean, it’s the greatest stupidity. And
they crucified Him,

00:18:08.048 --> 00:18:11.438
it was all known because these people
were so stupid

00:18:11.639 --> 00:18:15.014
that they would have only crucified Him,
what else they could do?

00:18:15.238 --> 00:18:19.691
Because they couldn’t bear, with their
little egos, somebody who is so simple,

00:18:19.892 --> 00:18:23.029
who is so genuine, who is so true.

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:32.015
So they crucified Him and that crucifixion
came as a breakthrough for us.

00:18:32.216 --> 00:18:36.257
But message for us is the resurrection
part.

00:18:36.458 --> 00:18:41.492
Message for us is the resurrection, and
not crucifixion.

00:18:41.693 --> 00:18:45.561
Crucifixion is not the message, because
He’s done it for us.

00:18:45.762 --> 00:18:51.539
This is the point where Jews must
understand.

00:18:52.284 --> 00:18:55.842
The other day I was reading - today only -

00:18:56.043 --> 00:19:04.104
some discussion with the Archbishop
of Canterbury took place.

00:19:04.305 --> 00:19:08.752
And the fellow who was asking him was
asking him questions

00:19:08.953 --> 00:19:13.682
as if he was asking questions to God.

00:19:14.616 --> 00:19:18.780
In a way he said so also that, “I would
ask this question to God,

00:19:18.981 --> 00:19:22.401
that, why is it so many Jews were killed?”

00:19:22.602 --> 00:19:25.317
They asked for it.

00:19:25.518 --> 00:19:29.751
They wanted that they must suffer

00:19:29.952 --> 00:19:33.366
because they wouldn’t give the credit
of suffering to Christ.

00:19:33.567 --> 00:19:37.061
They thought, “We all have to suffer.”
Ego. It’s ego.

00:19:37.262 --> 00:19:42.409
“How dare anybody suffer for us? We must
suffer separately.”

00:19:43.259 --> 00:19:44.710
They couldn’t give that credit to Christ

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:52.981
and all the later thinking was that,
“We must suffer.”

00:19:53.182 --> 00:20:01.261
So, whatever you think, comes into action
on this gross level,

00:20:01.462 --> 00:20:06.753
so Mr. Hitler was born and he made them
suffer.

00:20:10.427 --> 00:20:18.285
And the stupidity of human beings
is responsible

00:20:18.486 --> 00:20:23.481
for all the problems that are created
on this earth.

00:20:23.682 --> 00:20:26.430
The other question was, “How the children
get leukemia?”

00:20:26.631 --> 00:20:28.423
He would ask God, “How children get it?”

00:20:28.624 --> 00:20:34.330
If the parents are so frantic and speedy,
children have to get it.

00:20:35.459 --> 00:20:40.192
If you are not relaxed person when you
are married

00:20:40.393 --> 00:20:44.020
and when you are going to have a baby,
you are thinking of divorces

00:20:44.221 --> 00:20:48.271
and all sorts of nonsense, that franticness
will work on the child.

00:20:48.472 --> 00:20:51.569
Psychologically it is a left-side problem,
and the child has to be

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:59.370
a patient of leukemia as soon as he is
born. That is what it is.

00:21:03.384 --> 00:21:10.992
So the problems are created by human beings
because of their stupidity.

00:21:11.193 --> 00:21:13.988
There is no problem that God has created
for you.

00:21:14.189 --> 00:21:17.627
He’s solved all your problems. All your
problems He solves;

00:21:17.828 --> 00:21:21.773
you have seen in Sahaj Yoga how He solves
your little, little problems even.

00:21:21.974 --> 00:21:27.750
But we create problems for ourselves
by our stupidity,

00:21:27.951 --> 00:21:38.039
by our addiction to elements, to material
things,

00:21:38.494 --> 00:21:43.466
to material habits. Matter sits on our
head.

00:21:47.272 --> 00:21:58.084
That is on the, we can say, on the level
of the earth element.

00:21:59.363 --> 00:22:04.437
Then we have other problems like
emotional attachments:

00:22:04.638 --> 00:22:07.992
“This is my daughter; this is my child;
this is my; this is mine;

00:22:08.193 --> 00:22:11.867
I’m so attached to my child.”

00:22:14.825 --> 00:22:19.349
Then, “This is my country. This is your
country.”

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:23.330
We create problem. This Falkland camp...
Falkland this thing

00:22:23.531 --> 00:22:26.914
is an artificial problem, you can see
that.

00:22:27.115 --> 00:22:30.147
I mean, when these people went there,
these Spaniards,

00:22:30.348 --> 00:22:32.961
they all should be driven back to Spain.

00:22:33.162 --> 00:22:37.902
And all from Brazil should be driven back
to Portugal.

00:22:38.103 --> 00:22:42.510
What are they doing there if this is
the situation?

00:22:42.711 --> 00:22:46.531
But they are all human beings! What is
this territory business?

00:22:46.732 --> 00:22:50.161
So let human beings live happily wherever
they are.

00:22:50.362 --> 00:22:53.053
What are they going to get out of this
territory?

00:22:53.254 --> 00:22:57.558
God never created Argentina, Chile, England
and all that,

00:22:57.759 --> 00:23:03.461
He created one homogeneous structure,
and it is to look after each other.

00:23:03.662 --> 00:23:06.448
Like a heart is created, a liver is
created,

00:23:06.649 --> 00:23:09.689
a brain is created, a nose is created.

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:14.758
If they start fighting - say this eye
starts fighting this eye.

00:23:14.959 --> 00:23:20.324
We laugh, but we human beings do the same
thing.

00:23:21.147 --> 00:23:23.616
We are all the time doing like this.

00:23:23.817 --> 00:23:29.885
This is the stupidity of human beings,
which is creating problem.

00:23:30.086 --> 00:23:33.071
And when you become very stupid,
somebody horrible

00:23:33.272 --> 00:23:36.176
takes advantage of that and comes
on this earth

00:23:36.377 --> 00:23:43.070
just like Hitler, and he tries to put you
right.

00:23:43.648 --> 00:23:49.993
You don’t need all that. You need only
wisdom and your realisation.

00:23:50.194 --> 00:23:54.025
And that is what is done today that you
have got realisation.

00:23:54.226 --> 00:24:00.870
So Easter for sahaj yogis all over
the world, is the most important happening,

00:24:01.071 --> 00:24:04.878
because if it had not happened it would
not have been possible

00:24:05.079 --> 00:24:08.395
to give realisation to people.

00:24:12.409 --> 00:24:14.766
I think Gavin will read it out to you
later on

00:24:14.967 --> 00:24:18.444
about what is written about Christ in Devi
Mahatmya.

00:24:18.645 --> 00:24:23.331
This book was written about 14,000 years
back by Markandeya.

00:24:23.532 --> 00:24:29.012
So imagine, 14,000 years back he knew,
being a seer, just like Blake,

00:24:29.213 --> 00:24:33.825
what was going to happen when Christ
was to come.

00:24:34.026 --> 00:24:36.638
But He was called as Mahavishnu. He was
not Vishnu,

00:24:36.839 --> 00:24:40.025
He was the son of Vishnu.

00:24:43.355 --> 00:24:51.234
And how many Christians understand about
Easter? They don’t.

00:24:51.435 --> 00:24:54.612
They - it’s - Christianity today is nothing
but a mental activity,

00:24:54.813 --> 00:24:57.255
that’s all, which is dead; nonsense it is.

00:24:57.456 --> 00:24:59.821
Just like any other nonsensical religion,
it has become

00:25:00.022 --> 00:25:04.340
another foolish, stupid religion, which has
no meaning.

00:25:04.541 --> 00:25:08.361
Unless and until you get your realisation,
unless and until you feel the vibrations,

00:25:08.562 --> 00:25:13.232
unless and until you feel this Divine
Surrounding Power, how will you understand?

00:25:13.433 --> 00:25:15.409
Because that’s the only thing that is
truth;

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:18.380
that’s the only thing that is reality,

00:25:18.581 --> 00:25:22.972
and unless and until you achieve it, how
will you know about Christ?

00:25:23.173 --> 00:25:27.421
And fighting about Him; how can you fight?
I can’t understand really.

00:25:27.622 --> 00:25:33.152
To me, it’s stupidity gone to another
extreme.

00:25:33.691 --> 00:25:37.439
By this thing, what you do actually,
is to use

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:42.389
all these great incarnations to kill each
other. Can you imagine?

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:46.972
The things that came to elevate you,
to make you into higher living

00:25:47.173 --> 00:25:50.742
are now used, the same things, the names
are used

00:25:50.943 --> 00:25:53.679
to kill each other, to bring down each
other.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.204
At the most, if you reach a point where
you don’t understand,

00:25:57.405 --> 00:26:01.122
then they start saying, “It’s a mystery.”

00:26:01.323 --> 00:26:04.563
What is the mystery? In Sahaj Yoga
there’s no mystery.

00:26:04.764 --> 00:26:08.986
It’s all just there.

00:26:09.435 --> 00:26:13.672
To me, human beings are a mystery.

00:26:13.873 --> 00:26:18.704
I don’t understand them. I can’t
understand.

00:26:18.905 --> 00:26:25.427
The resurrection of Christ has to now be
collective resurrection.

00:26:25.628 --> 00:26:33.109
This is what is Maha Yoga. Has to be
the collective resurrection

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:35.589
and for this collective resurrection,

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:40.283
first of all sahaj yogis must decide to be
collective.

00:26:40.484 --> 00:26:47.234
Because through Kundalini awakening,
you cross, no doubt, you cross through,

00:26:47.435 --> 00:26:52.717
but you enter an area of collectivity.

00:26:52.918 --> 00:26:58.453
And if you do not allow that collectivity
to permeate into you,

00:26:58.654 --> 00:27:01.178
then you come down.

00:27:01.379 --> 00:27:07.082
Supposing you become a state beyond
the element,

00:27:07.283 --> 00:27:10.641
the state where you are a collective being;

00:27:10.842 --> 00:27:13.366
you are aware of the collective being;

00:27:13.567 --> 00:27:16.924
you are aware that you are a part and
parcel of the whole;

00:27:17.125 --> 00:27:21.654
you are aware that you have to help
your nose and your eyes

00:27:21.855 --> 00:27:24.187
because you are part and parcel
of the whole.

00:27:24.388 --> 00:27:27.112
You reach that stage where you understand
that,

00:27:27.313 --> 00:27:32.216
“I am as important as other cells are, and
other cells are to be helped by me

00:27:32.417 --> 00:27:36.613
and they have to sustain me, we are one.”
There should be complete concord.

00:27:36.814 --> 00:27:42.587
This awareness comes after realisation,
and if you do not understand

00:27:42.788 --> 00:27:47.419
that this awareness, that this collective
awareness

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:53.417
is the only way you can stay in that area.
Otherwise you get out.

00:27:53.618 --> 00:28:03.743
You start having your smaller wells and
you just go down into them.

00:28:04.724 --> 00:28:09.481
The more you start to expand yourself,
you rise higher

00:28:09.698 --> 00:28:14.501
and then you are again with your badhas
or whatever it is.

00:28:14.702 --> 00:28:19.150
But if you think that, “I have to live
for the whole.

00:28:19.351 --> 00:28:26.181
I’m responsible for the whole. I’m
responsible for creating

00:28:26.577 --> 00:28:32.529
a nucleus of a cell which is going to look
after the whole,

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:35.557
and if I fall down the rest also suffers.

00:28:35.758 --> 00:28:40.982
I have no business to fall down because
I have been resurrected to this point.

00:28:41.183 --> 00:28:46.751
I have entered into the state of
collectivity, where my being,

00:28:46.952 --> 00:28:50.300
which is the Spirit, is the collective
being

00:28:50.501 --> 00:28:53.543
and I have to stay there, I have to be
there;

00:28:53.744 --> 00:28:58.219
I cannot fall, it’s not the way I can
live.”

00:28:58.443 --> 00:29:03.522
But I have seen after realisation also,
people cannot get out of their shells.

00:29:03.723 --> 00:29:08.758
They still remain in the shell. They cannot
spread their wings

00:29:08.959 --> 00:29:16.531
and sing, and get out of their shell and
just fly.

00:29:16.732 --> 00:29:21.764
They cannot do it. They still stick on to
their small ways of life,

00:29:21.965 --> 00:29:24.780
in a smaller ways, in every way.

00:29:24.981 --> 00:29:29.590
In a holiday you go, you want to have
a separate holiday. Why?

00:29:29.791 --> 00:29:33.200
This is the holiday time, holy-day as they
say.

00:29:33.401 --> 00:29:38.132
Holy day. This is the holy-day. When you
are with other sahaja yogis

00:29:38.333 --> 00:29:42.827
you are really enjoying the holiday. Where
do you enjoy a holiday otherwise?

00:29:43.028 --> 00:29:48.623
Which is the other way? To be with them
is the real holiday.

00:29:49.107 --> 00:29:54.953
And that is why one should understand that
you should expand your collectivity.

00:29:55.154 --> 00:29:58.474
If you do not expand your collectivity
you are just a waste.

00:29:58.675 --> 00:30:02.931
You are a wasteful creation of sahaj yogis,

00:30:03.132 --> 00:30:06.918
which I’m sorry to say, will go down.

00:30:07.119 --> 00:30:09.189
Such people show also, in the beginning,

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:13.691
gradually they start getting better and
better and better.

00:30:13.892 --> 00:30:16.518
And once you are there in full state,
you really enjoy each

00:30:16.719 --> 00:30:19.191
other’s company without having any fears
about them,

00:30:19.392 --> 00:30:21.629
without having any possessiveness about
them,

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:28.446
without having any kind of expectation,
but just enjoying each other.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:34.546
That has to happen. Like all our cells
in our body are like that.

00:30:34.747 --> 00:30:42.381
If they can do it, why not we? Because
we have so much of sense;

00:30:42.582 --> 00:30:46.241
at least we think we have more sense
than the cells have.

00:30:46.442 --> 00:30:49.206
At least it is expected, because we have
evolved so much

00:30:49.407 --> 00:30:52.019
from a unicell to this state.

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:56.603
And then you are the epitome of God’s
creation;

00:30:56.804 --> 00:31:00.249
you are the topmost people. Then why not?

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:03.547
When you are resurrected, the first thing
that should happen to you

00:31:03.748 --> 00:31:07.304
is to understand that you are no more
an individual,

00:31:07.505 --> 00:31:11.634
but you are a collective being. You are
no more an individual.

00:31:11.857 --> 00:31:21.223
All things which make you circumcise
your individuality - throw that away.

00:31:21.952 --> 00:31:25.240
You are no more an individual. All problems
which come to you

00:31:25.441 --> 00:31:34.340
as individual problems are absolutely
useless, false, wasteful.

00:31:34.541 --> 00:31:39.465
Think of the collective problems. I enjoy
such people.

00:31:39.666 --> 00:31:44.964
Like the other day Fergie was anxious
to know about Bristol -

00:31:45.165 --> 00:31:50.413
which points are there, which are giving
vibrations from the Mother Earth.

00:31:50.614 --> 00:31:53.759
He’s worried about the whole of Bristol -
all the Jamaicans,

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:59.288
then about the whole Britain - British
people,

00:31:59.489 --> 00:32:03.283
and then of the whole world you should be.
That’s what one should think.

00:32:03.484 --> 00:32:06.731
One should not think, “How will my daughter
get married?

00:32:06.932 --> 00:32:09.084
How can I get a ticket to go there?”

00:32:09.285 --> 00:32:11.656
All these nonsensical ideas should be
given up

00:32:11.857 --> 00:32:14.955
because you are now entered into
the Kingdom of God

00:32:15.156 --> 00:32:18.222
and He is going to look after you.

00:32:18.452 --> 00:32:23.170
Because that state you establish within
yourself that you are a collective being.

00:32:23.371 --> 00:32:26.927
All other things will drop out. Gradually
everybody will be molded.

00:32:27.128 --> 00:32:32.067
Even the most difficult I have seen,
have improved.

00:32:32.268 --> 00:32:35.469
But what about you, the one who is
improving everybody else,

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:38.472
what about you? How far you are there?

00:32:38.673 --> 00:32:41.714
How far in your faith that you know that,

00:32:41.915 --> 00:32:44.995
“I have entered into the Kingdom of God

00:32:45.196 --> 00:32:49.798
and that every action mine is looked
after and guided

00:32:49.999 --> 00:32:52.556
by His power and I’m aware of it.

00:32:52.757 --> 00:32:56.587
I’m aware that I have entered into
the Kingdom of God

00:32:56.788 --> 00:32:59.624
which is expressed through my
collectivity.”

00:32:59.825 --> 00:33:04.938
So collectivity is the nature
of a sahaj yogi.

00:33:05.922 --> 00:33:09.068
And that’s what one has to realise.

00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:12.297
May God bless you all.

00:33:12.604 --> 00:33:17.477
Is it all right now? Just time.

00:33:20.885 --> 00:33:25.881
How I manage it, without looking
at the watch?

00:33:59.586 --> 00:34:02.920
Come forward. There’s some people standing.

00:34:03.121 --> 00:34:07.766
Come forward. I’ll have some water.

00:34:08.227 --> 00:34:11.191
First some tea.

00:34:31.126 --> 00:34:37.973
I mean, all these lectures if you could
tape [Hallo, Athena, hallo!] –

00:34:38.953 --> 00:34:44.086
if you could tape all these and sort of
send some of them to France and –

00:34:44.287 --> 00:34:48.356
or from Lille they have come both of them –

00:34:48.557 --> 00:34:55.283
and I think it should work out.

00:34:55.483 --> 00:34:58.770
Because first the people come in, then
they disappear.

00:34:58.971 --> 00:35:05.002
As usual, that’s the common feature,
you see. Then gradually they…

00:35:06.293 --> 00:35:09.054
Yogi: Mother?
Shri Mataji: It’s lovely.

00:35:09.255 --> 00:35:11.899
Yogi: If someone makes a list of Your
lectures,

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:16.049
what You’ve been speaking about, as it
was along which we got one,

00:35:16.272 --> 00:35:18.679
we can print a list each month
on a newsletter,

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.333
so the people in other centres can write
and ask for tapes in writing,

00:35:21.534 --> 00:35:23.529
ask which wants…
Shri Mataji: That’s a good thing.

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:28.022
You must every time I speak you will give
it a heading.

00:35:28.223 --> 00:35:32.637
All that we should. What is it?

00:35:32.838 --> 00:35:34.698
Is it coming?
Yogi: The radio programme.

00:35:34.898 --> 00:35:38.260
Shri Mataji: Ah, is it coming?

00:35:40.365 --> 00:35:43.344
It’s still time.

00:35:44.006 --> 00:35:47.572
Yes, that is important. I agree

00:35:47.773 --> 00:35:52.565
that we must have a list of things where…

00:35:52.766 --> 00:35:55.267
You have to give it a title - you see,
I have no titles,

00:35:55.468 --> 00:35:59.406
but you have to give a title. For example
what you can say

00:35:59.607 --> 00:36:07.483
is the Resurrection of Christ, or something
about Easter.

00:36:14.714 --> 00:36:18.410
Actually you can contact this Bishop
of Canterbury.

00:36:18.611 --> 00:36:27.457
This - you know... Poor man, he is not such
a staunch Christian, I feel, the way…

00:36:29.438 --> 00:36:32.353
I think next time you may write a letter
to him,

00:36:32.554 --> 00:36:35.341
and some of you can go and see him.

00:36:35.542 --> 00:36:38.617
And Gregoire comes, and three-four people
you should ask for a thing.

00:36:38.817 --> 00:36:42.828
And you should say - today’s, can you get
today’s Times?

00:36:43.029 --> 00:36:45.067
Or if you can telephone to my servant,

00:36:45.268 --> 00:36:49.432
tell him not to throw today’s newspaper,
he’s a good thrower

00:36:49.633 --> 00:36:52.328
Very good at throwing. Can somebody
telephone to him?

00:36:52.528 --> 00:36:57.673
Is a phone here available? John?

00:36:57.873 --> 00:37:01.711
Yogi: He used to be in the cathedral
of Saint-Albans. Shri Mataji: Eh?

00:37:01.911 --> 00:37:04.624
Yogi: He used to be in the cathedral
of Saint-Albans. You know?

00:37:04.825 --> 00:37:07.740
He was there when You were there.
Gavin: When You were in St. Albans,

00:37:07.941 --> 00:37:10.807
when Djamel was living at St. Alban,
You visited there,

00:37:11.007 --> 00:37:13.382
he was the bishop there. That time.
Yogi: He was the bishop there.

00:37:13.582 --> 00:37:16.695
Shri Mataji: How was he?
Yogi: I didn’t know him at that time,

00:37:16.896 --> 00:37:20.573
but soon after You visited, he got
promoted.

00:37:20.774 --> 00:37:24.776
Shri Mataji: Really? Good idea!

00:37:24.977 --> 00:37:29.659
So we can write to him. [Yogi: Yes] I might
have met him there also, possibly.

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:35.090
Might have seen him.
[Yogi: “It’s quite possible, yes”]

00:38:06.294 --> 00:38:12.982
Gavin, you have to collect my passport
tomorrow. All right?

00:38:13.183 --> 00:38:18.695
Then I would say, on 5th of May,

00:38:18.896 --> 00:38:22.965
if you people could collect some money
for this building.

00:38:23.166 --> 00:38:27.863
That’s a good day, when you can give it
to me, or to Gregoire [Yogi: Yes],

00:38:28.064 --> 00:38:32.227
and we can put that money in the bank,
we have opened now an account for that.

00:38:32.428 --> 00:38:36.368
Any amount that people want to give,
and the first amount –

00:38:36.583 --> 00:38:40.264
and also Lille people wanted to give
some money.

00:38:40.465 --> 00:38:43.795
I told them that’s for our, you should
give it for our building account,

00:38:43.995 --> 00:38:48.322
because we have to have a building now,
it’s absolutely eminent.

00:38:48.523 --> 00:38:52.350
Before I go back, you could have money

00:38:52.551 --> 00:39:01.091
for which you can also tell Warren

00:39:01.292 --> 00:39:03.957
that this is what is decided.

00:39:04.158 --> 00:39:09.503
Then the first amount should go on the 5th,
would be a good idea.

00:39:09.704 --> 00:39:15.651
And I’ve got the account number also,
so you can send it

00:39:15.852 --> 00:39:20.377
in the name of Gregoire, and the account
number I’ll give it to you.

00:39:20.578 --> 00:39:26.562
If you want, it should be all right.

00:39:26.769 --> 00:39:31.104
Gavin: May I ask You to find out how many
people are about to go to Paris from here?

00:39:31.304 --> 00:39:35.511
Shri Mataji: Now. Now, for Paris, the thing
is, it is on Tuesday,

00:39:35.712 --> 00:39:38.991
the programme is on Tuesday.

00:39:39.905 --> 00:39:46.119
And she has arranged that we go to Lille
on Sunday.

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:51.551
So if you come to Lille on Sunday,

00:39:51.761 --> 00:40:00.426
after the programme, if you want, you all
can go to Paris,

00:40:00.638 --> 00:40:08.126
and stay in the ashram there. Or is it
possible in Lille?

00:40:09.863 --> 00:40:13.824
Is there any place where we can take it
on rent for a night somewhere?

00:40:14.025 --> 00:40:16.442
Yogi: No problem, Mother.
Shri Mataji: What is it?

00:40:16.643 --> 00:40:19.170
Yogi: No problem.
Shri Mataji: No problem? Sure?

00:40:19.371 --> 00:40:22.358
Yogi: There’s definitely place.

00:40:22.605 --> 00:40:26.670
Shri Mataji: All right, so one night you
can stay in Lille. Will be good idea.

00:40:26.871 --> 00:40:29.947
Yogi: If there are enough people we could
also take a bus. Shri Mataji: Hm?

00:40:30.148 --> 00:40:32.340
Yogi: We could take a bus to travel.
Shri Mataji: Good.

00:40:32.541 --> 00:40:36.893
Yogi: If there are enough people, we just
have to find out how many want to get there.

00:40:37.094 --> 00:40:41.009
Shri Mataji: Now, from Lille then we go
to Paris.

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:44.560
In Paris you have a big place to the…

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:51.541
that will be the Monday, Tuesday,

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:58.813
and Wednesday we have this Puja,
in the morning time perhaps,

00:41:00.108 --> 00:41:03.579
and I would like to come back if possible
on the 6th.

00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:08.943
If 5th is all right, all right, otherwise
6th you can put it.

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:19.751
Somebody is working it out in Brussels!

00:41:19.952 --> 00:41:23.153
Did you write to that doctor? [Yogi:
“Yes, Mother…”] Good.

00:41:23.354 --> 00:41:26.762
Have you kept his address? [Yogi: Yes…]

00:41:31.271 --> 00:41:34.484
I think on Gavin I put too much pressure
also sometimes.

00:41:34.685 --> 00:41:39.560
Somebody must try to share that also.
And you should find out.

00:41:39.761 --> 00:41:44.280
It’s easy to telephone to him, I know his
number very well.

00:41:44.481 --> 00:41:47.833
But you can find out, all of you, if he
needs any help.

00:41:48.034 --> 00:41:51.328
Magda, sometimes you can telephone
to him [Magda: “Yes, Shri Mataji”],

00:41:51.529 --> 00:41:55.497
and find out if he needs any help, for
writing some letters or something,

00:41:55.698 --> 00:41:59.202
and also for typing anything –

00:41:59.403 --> 00:42:03.121
anybody who wants to help him, you see,
it’s essential,

00:42:03.321 --> 00:42:07.689
because I trouble him quite a lot.

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:13.439
And also you have a little account for
sending letters and things,

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:19.842
and for telephones, a little account can
be made. Everybody should -

00:42:20.043 --> 00:42:25.416
now, because we are expanding, we have
to have a proper system

00:42:25.616 --> 00:42:30.773
by which we work it out. So many letters
come to me every day,

00:42:30.974 --> 00:42:34.969
and I’m so lazy, I just can’t… I don’t
know.

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:40.203
I think if I write now, then another will
come tomorrow, so I wait for a while.

00:42:40.404 --> 00:42:44.474
Then I - but my attention is there. If you
write to me,

00:42:44.674 --> 00:42:47.118
I’m very happy because I know what is
happening.

00:42:47.319 --> 00:42:51.405
But don’t write very long letters, you
know.

00:42:54.392 --> 00:42:57.455
I like, I enjoy them, but if they are too
long,

00:42:57.656 --> 00:43:00.383
then, you know, the main thing is left out.

00:43:00.584 --> 00:43:08.554
We have to be to the point and properly
with the protocol and all that.

00:43:08.755 --> 00:43:13.742
There’s one gentleman who writes to me
regularly from India.

00:43:13.943 --> 00:43:16.743
His name is Mr. Brahme, Mr. Brahme.

00:43:16.944 --> 00:43:24.113
And he writes only two sentences:
one is that, “Mother,

00:43:24.459 --> 00:43:29.900
please bless me that I will be a good
sahaja yogi”,

00:43:30.101 --> 00:43:34.998
“Mother, please bless the whole world
that they become sahaja yogis,

00:43:35.199 --> 00:43:37.712
and the Sahaja Yoga spreads,

00:43:37.913 --> 00:43:45.072
and your most loving son at Your Lotus
Feet, so and so.” That’s all.

00:43:48.538 --> 00:43:54.759
Every - regularly, I must have so many
letters from him, that’s all.

00:43:56.918 --> 00:43:59.875
It’s good after all: whenever you write
praise and all that it’s good.

00:44:00.076 --> 00:44:05.546
But sometimes you know, we go on writing –

00:44:05.747 --> 00:44:12.371
like one gentleman has written, “I’ve been
working for two years,

00:44:12.572 --> 00:44:19.145
I’ve done everything, I’ve done nimbu,
I’ve done this,

00:44:19.346 --> 00:44:23.453
I’ve done this, I’ve done that and I’ve not
felt the vibrations”, you see.

00:44:23.656 --> 00:44:28.610
But the list of things he gave, you see,
made me laugh really:

00:44:28.811 --> 00:44:33.378
“Oh My, you must be fed up!”

00:44:34.364 --> 00:44:38.035
And the simple thing he is doing wrong,
which people didn’t understand

00:44:38.235 --> 00:44:40.759
that is he is doing Gayatri mantra.

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:46.345
If you do Gayatri mantra, it doesn’t
work out.

00:44:46.862 --> 00:44:51.141
I mean, this is so common, I mean, while
we are here,

00:44:51.342 --> 00:44:57.679
Gayatri mantra if people have done,
their right side is so much horrible,

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:03.724
and it doesn’t work out at all. So you have
to neutralise it with Lord’s Prayer,

00:45:03.925 --> 00:45:06.765
and with forgiveness to others,

00:45:06.966 --> 00:45:13.727
with the right hand towards the photograph
and left hand outside.

00:45:13.928 --> 00:45:18.964
And never to say Gayatri mantra again,
you see? But that’s what it is.

00:45:19.165 --> 00:45:25.208
But these small, small things people don’t
notice when I’m treating others.

00:45:25.425 --> 00:45:29.762
And I don’t know how to talk about it,
one by one,

00:45:29.963 --> 00:45:33.123
because when it comes before me, I know
the solution.

00:45:33.324 --> 00:45:37.222
So it’s better that you people note it down
what Mother does at that time.

00:45:37.423 --> 00:45:45.943
Now this Gayatri mantra is one of the worst
curses on human beings, I think.

00:45:46.145 --> 00:45:49.471
It is so right-sided.

00:45:50.379 --> 00:45:52.756
An Indian, if he does Gayatri mantra,

00:45:52.957 --> 00:46:03.055
he becomes ten times worse that any
westerner. Think of it.

00:46:03.256 --> 00:46:06.731
Now, can you read it? Now is it started?

00:46:07.027 --> 00:46:12.095
Yogis: Somebody has to set the frequency…
The right frequency for …

00:46:18.791 --> 00:46:25.667
Shri Mataji: Why not start the radio?
Yogi: I think everything’s on.

00:46:25.883 --> 00:46:31.521
Shri Mataji: Is there no radio there?
(Yogi: “Yes, Mother.”) What’s happening?

00:46:40.424 --> 00:46:44.162
Shri Mataji: Loudly, I can’t hear.

00:46:47.352 --> 00:46:51.568
Yogi: It begins after five, Mother.

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:12.542
Shri Mataji: Is it?

00:47:20.394 --> 00:47:23.276
More loudly.

00:48:16.612 --> 00:48:22.140
Is it yours? [Yogi: “No, Mother… it’s
a hour-long programme, Mother...”]

00:48:22.346 --> 00:48:25.623
[Yogi: “You see, we didn’t take all
of it…”] All right, all right.

00:48:31.204 --> 00:48:37.458
That’s better.

00:48:40.663 --> 00:48:46.069
You have to go through all nonsense
to listen to some sense of that.

00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:54.751
Gavin, what have you got? You read
the Bible, I think?

00:48:54.951 --> 00:48:59.602
Gavin: Yes. It’s a very appropriate psalm
we’ve discovered, Mother, very short…

00:48:59.803 --> 00:49:02.403
Shri Mataji: Must be, must be. Gavin: ...
for the ashrams. Shri Mataji: Eh?

00:49:02.604 --> 00:49:06.918
Gavin: It’s for the ashrams.
Shri Mataji: Lovely.

00:49:08.713 --> 00:49:13.007
Gavin: “Psalm 133.

00:49:13.294 --> 00:49:16.025
(1) Behold, how good and how pleasant it is

00:49:16.234 --> 00:49:20.584
for brethren to dwell together in unity!

00:49:20.785 --> 00:49:24.089
(2) It is like the precious ointment upon
the head,

00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:28.672
that ran down upon the beard, even
Aaron’s beard:

00:49:28.883 --> 00:49:32.834
that went down to the skirts of his
garments;

00:49:33.037 --> 00:49:39.874
(3) As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew
that descended upon the mountains of Zion:

00:49:40.075 --> 00:49:46.581
for there the Lord commanded the blessing,
even life for evermore”.

00:49:46.782 --> 00:49:54.032
Shri Mataji: See? Very beautiful you found
out, I must say.

00:50:01.937 --> 00:50:06.283
Now what is it? Devi Mahatmya you read
it out.

00:50:06.484 --> 00:50:11.277
[“SRIMAD DEVI BHAGAVATAM,”
BOOK 9, CHAPTER 3]

00:50:11.491 --> 00:50:17.241
Gavin: “Narayana said:– ‘O Devarshi!
The egg (born of Mula Prakriti)

00:50:17.442 --> 00:50:22.960
that was floating in the waters for a
period equal to the life period of Brahma,

00:50:23.168 --> 00:50:28.330
now in the fullness of time separated
into two parts.

00:50:28.531 --> 00:50:31.715
Within that egg there was a powerful child,

00:50:31.916 --> 00:50:38.207
lustrous like one thousand millions
of suns.” Shri Mataji: Suns. See.

00:50:38.408 --> 00:50:44.739
Gavin: “This child could not suck Mother’s
milk as it was forsaken by Her.

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:50.403
So, being tired of hunger, the child, for
a moment, cried repeatedly”.

00:50:50.604 --> 00:50:54.240
Shri Mataji: Forsaken because He had
to grow!

00:50:54.441 --> 00:50:58.959
Gavin: “The child that will become the lord
of countless Brahmandas (universes) -”

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:02.757
Shri Mataji: Countless Brahmandas.
Brahmandas are universes.

00:51:02.958 --> 00:51:05.792
Gavin: “…now an orphan having no father
nor mother

00:51:05.993 --> 00:51:10.271
began to look upwards from the waters.

00:51:10.506 --> 00:51:15.278
This boy came to be denominated afterwards
by the name of Maha Virat

00:51:15.479 --> 00:51:19.522
when He became gross and grosser.

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:27.461
As there is nothing finer than radium, so
there is nothing grosser than Maha Virat.

00:51:27.799 --> 00:51:31.637
The power of this Maha Virat, one-sixteenth
of that of Shri Krishna,

00:51:31.837 --> 00:51:38.362
the Highest Self. But this boy…”
Shri Mataji: That is Yehova.

00:51:40.001 --> 00:51:43.287
Gavin: “…But this boy, (born of
the Prakruti Radha),

00:51:43.488 --> 00:51:49.084
is the Sole Stay of all this Universe”…
Shri Mataji: Sole Stay.

00:51:49.285 --> 00:51:54.153
Gavin: “… He is denominated by the name
Maha Vishnu.

00:51:54.354 --> 00:51:59.008
In his every pore countless universes
are existing.

00:51:59.209 --> 00:52:04.132
So much so that even Shri Krishna could
not count them.

00:52:04.333 --> 00:52:08.074
If it were possible to count the number
of dust particles,

00:52:08.275 --> 00:52:12.825
it is impossible to count the number
of the universes.

00:52:13.026 --> 00:52:17.536
So there are endless Brahmas, Vishnus,
and Maheshwaras.

00:52:17.737 --> 00:52:22.857
In every Brahmanda, there is Brahma,
Vishnu, and Mahesha.

00:52:23.058 --> 00:52:28.873
Each Brahmanda extends from Patala
to the Brahmaloka.

00:52:29.074 --> 00:52:32.210
The abode of Vaikuntha is higher than that

00:52:32.411 --> 00:52:38.035
(that is, it is situated outside
of Brahmanda),

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:42.181
again the abode of Goloka is fifty koti
yojanas

00:52:42.382 --> 00:52:48.328
(that is 50 x 10 x 4 x 2 million miles)
higher than Vaikuntha.

00:52:48.592 --> 00:52:56.742
This Goloka Dhama is eternal and real
as Shri Krishna is eternal and real.

00:52:56.943 --> 00:53:02.382
This world composed of seven islands
is surrounded by the seven oceans.

00:53:02.583 --> 00:53:08.190
Forty-nine Upa Dvipas (smaller islands
adjacent to them) exist here.

00:53:08.391 --> 00:53:12.757
Besides there are countless mountains
and forests.

00:53:12.958 --> 00:53:16.523
Higher than this earth is the Brahmaloka
with seven heavens,

00:53:16.724 --> 00:53:19.844
and below this, are the seven Patalas.

00:53:20.045 --> 00:53:23.928
This is the bounding limit of Brahmanda.

00:53:24.129 --> 00:53:26.884
Just above this earth there is
the Bhurloka,

00:53:27.085 --> 00:53:31.190
above is Bhuvaloka, then Swahaloka,
then Janahloka,

00:53:31.391 --> 00:53:34.463
then Tapahloka, then Satyaloka, and
above that …”

00:53:34.664 --> 00:53:39.361
Shri Mataji: Mahaloka. Mahaloka not there?
Maha. Gavin: Brahmaloka.

00:53:39.562 --> 00:53:43.103
Shri Mataji: Bhur, Bhuvah, Swaha.
They call it Brahma.

00:53:43.304 --> 00:53:45.439
Gavin: Bhur, Bhuva, Swaha.
Shri Mataji: Swaha, Tapah.

00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:47.360
Gavin: Janah.
Shri Mataji: Janah. Tapah.

00:53:47.561 --> 00:53:51.200
Gavin: Satya and Brahmaloka.

00:53:51.401 --> 00:53:55.540
“The splendor of Brahmaloka is like that
of molten gold.

00:53:55.741 --> 00:54:01.661
But all the substances whether outside
or inside this Brahmaloka, are transient.

00:54:01.862 --> 00:54:06.541
When this Brahmanda dissolves, everything
dissolves and is destroyed.

00:54:06.742 --> 00:54:10.124
All are temporary like bubbles of water.

00:54:10.325 --> 00:54:15.264
Only Goloka and Vaikuntha are eternal.

00:54:15.479 --> 00:54:20.328
In every pore of this Maha Virat is
existing one Brahmanda.

00:54:20.547 --> 00:54:23.663
What to speak about…”. Shri Mataji: Hm.
Pore means any – every –

00:54:23.864 --> 00:54:27.477
what you call this, pore of the skin.

00:54:27.688 --> 00:54:34.189
One Brahmanda exists in Christ.
[Aside] Thank you.

00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:36.836
Gavin: “What to speak of others when
even Krishna cannot count

00:54:37.037 --> 00:54:39.764
the number of these Brahmandas.

00:54:39.972 --> 00:54:44.252
In every Brahmanda there is Brahma,
Vishnu and Mahesha.

00:54:44.453 --> 00:54:46.660
O Child Narada! In every Brahmanda,

00:54:46.861 --> 00:54:52.031
the number of the gods is three kotis
or 30 millions.

00:54:52.232 --> 00:54:55.368
Some of them are the Dikpatis (the Regents
of the quarters);

00:54:55.569 --> 00:54:58.687
some are the Dikpalas (the Rulers
of the quarters),

00:54:58.888 --> 00:55:02.104
some are asterisms, and some are planets.

00:55:02.305 --> 00:55:06.950
In the Bhurloka, there are four Varnas
(Brahmins, etc.,)

00:55:07.167 --> 00:55:10.589
and in the Patalas there are Nagas.

00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:15.659
Thus the Universe exists composed
of moveable and non-moveable things.

00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:19.248
(This is Brahmanda Vivriti).

00:55:19.449 --> 00:55:22.230
O Nârada! Now the Virat Purusha

00:55:22.446 --> 00:55:25.590
began to look up to the skies again
and again

00:55:25.791 --> 00:55:31.078
but He could not see anything within
that egg except the void.

00:55:31.279 --> 00:55:37.180
Then distressed with hunger He cried out
repeatedly and became merged in anxiety.

00:55:37.381 --> 00:55:39.994
Next moment getting back His consciousness,

00:55:40.195 --> 00:55:43.894
He began to think of Krishna, the Highest
Person

00:55:44.095 --> 00:55:48.311
and saw there at once the eternal light
of Brahma.

00:55:48.512 --> 00:55:52.460
He saw there His form as deep blue like
new rain-cloud;

00:55:52.661 --> 00:55:56.155
with two bands [Original text reads
“hands”], garment of a yellow color,

00:55:56.356 --> 00:56:00.554
sweet smile on His face, flute in His hand

00:56:00.755 --> 00:56:06.259
and He seemed to be very anxious to show
His Grace to Devotees.

00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:10.737
Looking at the Lord, His Father, the boy
became glad and smiled.

00:56:10.956 --> 00:56:16.609
The Lord, the bestower of boon, granted
Him boons appropriate for that moment.

00:56:16.813 --> 00:56:20.171
Oh child, let you possess knowledge
like me,

00:56:20.372 --> 00:56:23.277
let your hunger and thirst vanish:
let you ...”

00:56:23.478 --> 00:56:28.171
Shri Mataji: See. Hunger and thirst vanish.
He fasted for forty days.

00:56:28.372 --> 00:56:31.716
See, all the indications are there.

00:56:31.979 --> 00:56:34.610
Gavin: “…let you be the holder
of innumerable Brahmandas

00:56:34.811 --> 00:56:39.557
till the time of Pralaya (the universal
dissolution).

00:56:40.217 --> 00:56:42.671
Be without any selfishness,

00:56:42.879 --> 00:56:47.063
be fearless and the bestower of boons
to all.

00:56:47.264 --> 00:56:52.674
Let not old age, death, disease, sorrow
or any other ailings afflict thee.”

00:56:52.875 --> 00:56:57.407
Shri Mataji: This is a sign of a Brahma
Shakti.

00:56:57.611 --> 00:57:03.125
He Himself has said before that the Brahma
Shakti, or the Spirit

00:57:03.326 --> 00:57:09.656
does not die, does not get old and all
that, and He is telling him all that.

00:57:10.787 --> 00:57:15.674
Gavin: “Thus saying, He repeated thrice
on his ear the six-lettered great Mantra

00:57:15.875 --> 00:57:21.621
“Om Krishnaya Swaha” worshipped by
the Vedas with their Amgas,

00:57:21.822 --> 00:57:27.146
the Giver of desires and the destroyer
of all troubles and calamities.

00:57:27.347 --> 00:57:29.879
O Brahma’s Son! Thus giving the mantra,

00:57:30.096 --> 00:57:34.108
Shri Krishna arranged for His feeding thus.

00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:38.867
In every universe whatever offerings will
be given to Shri Krishna,

00:57:39.068 --> 00:57:43.967
one sixteenth of that will go to Narayana,
the Lord of Vaikuntha,

00:57:44.168 --> 00:57:49.670
and fifteen sixteenth is to go to this boy
the Virat. Shri Krishna…”

00:57:49.871 --> 00:57:52.681
Shri Mataji: He is Narayana also,
Shri Krishna is Narayana, you see.

00:57:52.882 --> 00:57:59.103
So one sixteenth will go to Narayana
and fifteen sixteenth to His son.

00:57:59.746 --> 00:58:03.013
Gavin: “Shri Krishna did not allot any
share for Himself.

00:58:03.213 --> 00:58:09.291
Himself transcending all the Gunas, full,
He is always satisfied with Himself.

00:58:09.513 --> 00:58:13.085
What necessity is there for any further
offerings?

00:58:13.286 --> 00:58:15.932
Whatever the people offer with devotion,

00:58:16.133 --> 00:58:20.687
the Lord of Lakshmi, the Virat eats
all these.

00:58:20.888 --> 00:58:25.723
Bhagavan Shri Krishna giving thus to
the Virat the boon and the mantra,

00:58:25.924 --> 00:58:32.122
said, “Oh child, say what more you desire.
I will give you that instantly.”

00:58:32.416 --> 00:58:36.775
The Virat boy hearing thus the words
of Shri Krishna spoke.

00:58:36.976 --> 00:58:41.417
“O, Thou Omnipresent, I have got no
desires whatsoever,

00:58:41.618 --> 00:58:46.692
save this that as long as I live, whether
for a short time or for a long time,

00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:51.189
me have pure bhakti towards Thy Lotus
Feet.”

00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:54.558
Shri Mataji: That’s why always Christ has
these fingers like this,

00:58:54.759 --> 00:59:01.088
one denoting towards Shri Krishna and
another towards Vishnu.

00:59:02.319 --> 00:59:05.998
He’s talked of His Father throughout.

00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:10.743
“For a short time or for a long time”:

00:59:10.943 --> 00:59:15.714
He lived for a short time and for a long
time.

00:59:21.468 --> 00:59:25.358
Gavin: “‘In this world he is Jivanmukta
(liberated whilst living)

00:59:25.559 --> 00:59:30.646
who is your Bhakta; and that bewildered
fool is dead while living

00:59:30.847 --> 00:59:33.559
who is devoid of any Bhakti to Thee.

00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:37.139
What needs he to perform Japam, asceticism,

00:59:37.350 --> 00:59:41.527
sacrifice, worship, holding fasts and
observances,

00:59:41.728 --> 00:59:46.120
going to sacred places of pilgrimages
and other virtuous acts

00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:49.678
if he be without any bhakti to
Shri Krishna?

00:59:49.879 --> 00:59:53.484
Vain is his life who is devoid of any
devotion to Shri Krishna,

00:59:53.685 --> 00:59:57.179
under Whose Grace he has obtained his life

00:59:57.380 --> 01:00:01.207
and Whom he does not now pay homage
and worship.

01:00:01.408 --> 01:00:07.030
He is endowed with Shakti as long as Atma
resides in his body;

01:00:07.231 --> 01:00:11.924
no sooner the Atma departs from his body
all the Shaktis accompany him.

01:00:12.125 --> 01:00:17.602
O Great One! And Thou art the Universal
Atman who transcends Prakriti,

01:00:17.803 --> 01:00:20.942
Who is All will, the Primeval Person -‘”
Shri Mataji: See?

01:00:21.143 --> 01:00:25.397
Gavin: “…and of the nature of the Highest
Light.

01:00:25.667 --> 01:00:30.039
O Child!” Thus saying, the Virat boy
remained silent.

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:34.210
Shri Krishna then spoke in sweet words,

01:00:34.411 --> 01:00:38.985
“Oh child, let you remain as fresh as ever
like Me.

01:00:39.186 --> 01:00:45.634
You will not have any fall even if
innumerable Brahmas pass away.

01:00:45.835 --> 01:00:51.141
Let you divide yourself in parts and turn
into smaller Virats in every universe.”

01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:53.214
Shri Mataji: That’s what He did.

01:00:53.415 --> 01:00:57.507
Gavin: “Brahma will spring from Your navel
and will create the cosmos.

01:00:57.708 --> 01:01:01.328
From the forehead of that Brahma will
spring eleven Rudras

01:01:01.528 --> 01:01:04.854
for the destruction of the creation.”
Shri Mataji: See.

01:01:05.055 --> 01:01:07.702
Gavin: “But they will all be parts
of Shiva.”

01:01:07.903 --> 01:01:11.087
Shri Mataji: That is given by Shiva to Him.

01:01:11.288 --> 01:01:17.376
You see, the eleven parts are given to this
child by Shiva.

01:01:18.718 --> 01:01:22.120
Gavin: “The Rudra named Kalagni, of these
eleven Rudras,

01:01:22.321 --> 01:01:27.290
will be the destroyer of all this Vishvas
(the cosmos).

01:01:27.491 --> 01:01:31.414
Besides, from each of your sub-divisions,
the Vishnu will originate

01:01:31.615 --> 01:01:37.157
and that Bhagavan Vishnu will be
the Preserver of this Vishvu world.

01:01:37.358 --> 01:01:41.908
I say that under My favour you will always
be full of bhakti towards Me

01:01:42.157 --> 01:01:48.360
and no sooner you meditate on Me, you
will be able to see My lovely form.

01:01:48.561 --> 01:01:53.294
There is no doubt in this; and your
Mother, Who resides in My breast,

01:01:53.503 --> 01:01:56.878
will not be difficult for you to see.”

01:01:57.079 --> 01:02:00.666
Shri Mataji: Better to see. Gavin: “Let
you remain here in ease and comfort.

01:02:00.867 --> 01:02:09.164
I now go to Goloka.” Saying thus Shri
Krishna, the Lord of world, disappears.

01:02:10.109 --> 01:02:15.686
Shri Mataji: See, it’s so clear cut. Better
send it to this Archbishop of Canterbury.

01:02:15.913 --> 01:02:19.311
What does he understand about Christ?

01:02:19.514 --> 01:02:25.162
That every pore of His skin is one
Brahmanda.

01:02:26.281 --> 01:02:28.715
So He became very gross, you see,

01:02:28.916 --> 01:02:32.303
in the sense that He came down
on this earth, you see,

01:02:32.504 --> 01:02:35.734
and then He became the Spirit.

01:02:37.576 --> 01:02:41.408
That’s why it is said, His “only Son.”

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:51.941
Yogi: Mother?

01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:01.127
Shri Mataji: What is happening?

01:03:03.398 --> 01:03:05.948
Nothing?

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:11.606
Yogi: Mother, may I read something for You?
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes.

01:03:12.147 --> 01:03:14.872
Yogi: Paul, Paul Duncan and I have written
this. Shri Mataji: Eh?

01:03:15.073 --> 01:03:16.957
Yogi: Paul Duncan and I have written this
for You.

01:03:17.158 --> 01:03:20.294
It’s called “Resurrection Sunday.”

01:03:20.495 --> 01:03:23.260
“We wandered lost in this confused age /

01:03:23.461 --> 01:03:26.734
You came to us like rain to a scorched
plain /

01:03:26.935 --> 01:03:29.070
We made so many foolish mistakes /

01:03:29.271 --> 01:03:32.120
But You laughed and loved us even more. /

01:03:32.321 --> 01:03:36.680
We walked always seeking Messiah’s return /

01:03:36.881 --> 01:03:39.175
And then You came with open arms. /

01:03:39.376 --> 01:03:42.019
We closed our hearts and ran our love dry /

01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:45.134
And You refreshed us with cooling Grace. /

01:03:45.335 --> 01:03:47.534
Mother, O Mother, River of Love /

01:03:47.735 --> 01:03:49.621
You wash our troubles away. /

01:03:49.823 --> 01:03:52.339
Mother, O Mother, Ocean of Joy /

01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:54.866
You are opening our flowers. /

01:03:55.067 --> 01:03:58.664
We struggled hard inside our shells /

01:03:58.865 --> 01:04:02.270
You took the eggs and made the doves. /

01:04:02.471 --> 01:04:05.941
We cried for love and forgot how to be /

01:04:06.142 --> 01:04:09.239
You wiped our tears and make us see. /

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:12.155
We needed the fulfillment of Christ’s
words /

01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:16.054
And then Mother Mary, You gave us
true second birth. /

01:04:16.257 --> 01:04:18.986
We languished in our man-made tombs /

01:04:19.213 --> 01:04:22.674
Divine Redeemer, You rolled away
the stone. /

01:04:22.875 --> 01:04:25.072
Mother, O Mother, River of Love /

01:04:25.307 --> 01:04:27.313
You wash all troubles away. /

01:04:27.514 --> 01:04:29.394
Mother, O Mother, Ocean of Joy /

01:04:29.613 --> 01:04:33.114
You open all the flowers.”

01:04:36.203 --> 01:04:39.592
Shri Mataji: So beautiful, I think.
Very beautiful.

01:04:39.793 --> 01:04:44.817
It’s like a mantra working on my
vibrations.

01:04:54.405 --> 01:04:57.322
So now all our programmes are fixed
for different days,

01:04:57.523 --> 01:05:04.698
and now I have received a letter from –
again from him, Jim,

01:05:04.899 --> 01:05:10.031
saying that he would like to have
a programme from the 15th of June now.

01:05:10.235 --> 01:05:17.913
And I personally think that he has put
last two days –

01:05:18.114 --> 01:05:25.945
one day to Norwich, and then one day
in Cambridge, then Norwich,

01:05:26.146 --> 01:05:36.033
I think 17th is Cambridge, 18th Norwich
and again Cambridge, and then Puja.

01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:40.214
Best is to keep two days in Cambridge –
first Norwich,

01:05:40.415 --> 01:05:43.593
that will be - what date did I tell you
to have Norwich?

01:05:43.794 --> 01:05:46.381
Yogi: The 18th, Jai Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: 18th should be Norwich,

01:05:46.582 --> 01:05:54.101
19th and 20th Cambridge, and 21st will
be the Puja. All right?

01:05:54.302 --> 01:05:58.697
Just change that much, otherwise it’s
perfectly alright.

01:06:02.158 --> 01:06:07.625
What else? Kevin, how are you?

01:06:07.826 --> 01:06:10.740
Yogi: Sorry, Shri Mataji…
Shri Mataji: Hot? Very hot?

01:06:10.941 --> 01:06:16.158
Yogi: No, I was late, I didn’t have time
to change my clothes.

01:06:16.359 --> 01:06:19.131
Shri Mataji: You are all right!

01:06:23.932 --> 01:06:26.175
You are all right.

01:06:26.386 --> 01:06:31.601
You see, when the Mother has seen you
in your “birthday suits”

01:06:31.802 --> 01:06:38.274
why should you worry about any dress
with your Mother, isn’t it?

01:06:41.065 --> 01:06:45.365
There is no formality with the Mother.

01:06:45.565 --> 01:06:47.646
It’s all right, She likes to see you
properly clad,

01:06:47.846 --> 01:06:51.811
but there’s nothing, no formality.

01:06:52.012 --> 01:06:55.645
[Aside, to somebody:] Thank you, that’s
all, thank you very much.

01:06:56.154 --> 01:06:58.205
[To the yogi] But you look serious, that’s
what I want to know.

01:06:58.405 --> 01:07:02.488
Yogi: Oh, I’m worried whether the Divine
is coming through on the tape.

01:07:02.689 --> 01:07:04.550
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.
Yogi: Because I don’t know!

01:07:04.751 --> 01:07:09.200
Shri Mataji: Yes, I was wondering what’s
the matter, why are you so serious –

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:14.380
no, I just thought, maybe because now
you are married

01:07:14.581 --> 01:07:19.226
and you are thinking of a married life now,

01:07:20.274 --> 01:07:26.045
what to do, and - No? No problems?
Yogi: No, no.

01:07:26.971 --> 01:07:29.997
Shri Mataji: You see, when you even tell
somebody, “You have to get married”,

01:07:30.198 --> 01:07:36.448
suddenly they … as if somebody has stuck
a pistol!

01:07:36.649 --> 01:07:41.850
That’s the first reaction I have seen
many-a-times.

01:07:42.051 --> 01:07:45.506
Pat has not come today? Yogini: No, Grazyna
is not very well, Mother.

01:07:45.707 --> 01:07:48.914
Shri Mataji: Hmm?
Yogini: Grazyna is still not very well...

01:07:49.115 --> 01:07:50.943
Shri Mataji: I know, poor thing.

01:07:51.143 --> 01:07:56.073
Yogini: They’d like to come and see You
next week…

01:07:56.542 --> 01:08:00.343
Shri Mataji: I have told - her problem
is basically something different,

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:04.622
and I have told the solution and I’ve asked
Gavin, Gavin to find out.

01:08:04.823 --> 01:08:07.848
Did you ask Sarah?
Gavin: I didn’t get the chance just yet.

01:08:08.049 --> 01:08:12.145
Shri Mataji: But Sarah is here, you can
talk to her.

01:08:12.346 --> 01:08:18.383
You see, we have a, we had a doctor
in India called Dr. Shirolkar,

01:08:18.584 --> 01:08:21.007
and he devised an operation – you might
have heard his name

01:08:21.207 --> 01:08:22.706
[Yogini comments probably on name,
Shri Mataji: “Ah”] –

01:08:22.907 --> 01:08:27.981
to strengthen the … - Who is crying
so much?

01:08:28.181 --> 01:08:30.283
Just see the child -

01:08:30.502 --> 01:08:35.728
the lower wall, the lower wall of
the uterus, you see?

01:08:35.929 --> 01:08:39.167
And that operation somebody must be
doing here also, I’m sure.

01:08:39.368 --> 01:08:43.298
Yogini: Yes, she had it. Shri Mataji: Eh?
Yogini: She had it done.

01:08:43.561 --> 01:08:47.984
Shri Mataji: She had that operation?
Yogini: She did, but it’s still… she still…

01:08:48.192 --> 01:08:51.006
Shri Mataji: No, but then she conceived
very early then. [Yogini: “Sorry?”]

01:08:51.207 --> 01:08:55.406
You have to wait after that to develop
into a proper…

01:08:55.607 --> 01:09:00.085
she had that kind of an operation, did she?
Yogini: I think she did it, yes.

01:09:01.204 --> 01:09:04.211
Shri Mataji: Then she should have waited
to see that the wall is fully developed,

01:09:04.411 --> 01:09:11.177
I think if she had allowed to - I’m going
to work out something else for her.

01:09:12.872 --> 01:09:18.794
You can have another layer just to make it
strong, you see? [Yogini: “Yes.”]

01:09:28.121 --> 01:09:31.301
Any other problems?

01:09:37.484 --> 01:09:43.565
[To a yogini] How are you now? Gail?
All right?

01:09:47.424 --> 01:09:49.325
Don’t do any heavy work, but walking
is good.

01:09:49.526 --> 01:09:52.694
In Regent Park, you can go in the morning
for a walk, not in (unclear word)

01:09:52.895 --> 01:09:56.572
but it’s a good place to walk about
little bit.

01:09:56.773 --> 01:09:59.180
[To another yogini] How are you? Why don’t
you sit on a chair,

01:09:59.381 --> 01:10:03.812
will be better, better. Better sit down
on a chair.

01:10:04.013 --> 01:10:08.942
Go. Go there, to sit down.

01:10:11.205 --> 01:10:14.494
So how are you? [Yogini: “I’m all right…” ]
Good.

01:10:14.695 --> 01:10:20.891
I’m happy you could come. I’m happy
you could come.

01:10:27.034 --> 01:10:31.257
Received any letter? He is telephoning me,

01:10:31.458 --> 01:10:36.510
he is telling me that he is trying to get
the permission and this and that,

01:10:36.711 --> 01:10:39.872
he’s going to write to me again. His style
is like this.

01:10:40.081 --> 01:10:48.215
You see, he doesn’t want to talk about it
unless he really gets the permission.

01:10:48.557 --> 01:10:52.140
Yogini: I wrote to him.
Shri Mataji: You've written to him, yes.

01:10:52.379 --> 01:10:55.589
He telephones to me.

01:11:02.311 --> 01:11:07.851
All suspiciousness, you see, because he is
in the Air Force,

01:11:08.052 --> 01:11:11.259
and the government is suspicious
of foreigners, you see,

01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:16.966
marrying any Air Force this thing, you see.

01:11:18.586 --> 01:11:21.870
I just don’t understand.

01:11:22.807 --> 01:11:25.579
So I would say take my passport, you have
to walk like a criminal

01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:27.865
with your passport number, this, that,

01:11:28.066 --> 01:11:32.771
and you have to get my visas in Rome
and these places.

01:11:32.972 --> 01:11:36.711
But I think he can do it, Dinesh knows
how to do it.

01:11:36.912 --> 01:11:38.973
Tell him to go to Varad, Varad Rajan,

01:11:39.174 --> 01:11:43.321
he’ll give him, because is a diplomatic
passport.

01:11:52.163 --> 01:11:56.820
How are you now, Kay, are you better? Hm.

01:12:00.487 --> 01:12:03.987
Bala, what about your chickenpox?

01:12:05.543 --> 01:12:09.122
Gone?
Bala: It’s gone.

01:12:11.814 --> 01:12:14.851
Shri Mataji: Djamel, how are you?

01:12:16.494 --> 01:12:21.444
Djamel: I’ve got the Agnya problem.
Shri Mataji: Agnya?

01:12:30.903 --> 01:12:35.675
On the day of Resurrection Agnya should
clear out.

01:12:35.914 --> 01:12:40.164
Somebody has done everything for us, you
see? Best is to rely on that, all done!

01:12:40.365 --> 01:12:43.959
What, so why should we worry?

01:12:46.281 --> 01:12:49.071
Hm, better.

01:12:50.873 --> 01:12:54.003
Hm. Everything is done for you,

01:12:54.204 --> 01:12:57.824
I mean, lucky people I must say.

01:12:58.025 --> 01:13:02.600
Like guests, you see? That till, all
others have to do everything for you,

01:13:02.801 --> 01:13:06.627
and you have the fruits of it. Isn’t it?
A good situation.

01:13:06.828 --> 01:13:14.103
But still you look so worried.

01:13:17.017 --> 01:13:23.107
As we say, there’s a dog walking under
a cart.

01:13:23.323 --> 01:13:29.105
He looks very worried because he thinks
he is carrying the cart, you see.

01:13:29.306 --> 01:13:37.162
And the poor – the one, one, the bullocks
which are pulling the cart are quite happy.

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:45.980
Better now?

01:13:47.950 --> 01:13:54.226
Is it true that in Islam they hate dogs?
Yogi: No, Mother.

01:13:54.427 --> 01:13:58.962
Shri Mataji: No? No. They don’t hate dogs.

01:13:59.163 --> 01:14:04.719
In Iran they – I don’t know why they hate
dogs so much.

01:14:04.922 --> 01:14:08.646
Somebody was telling me that they ill-treat
dogs, absolutely.

01:14:08.847 --> 01:14:12.014
I said, “Surprising it is.”
Yogi: Same in Malaysia.

01:14:12.215 --> 01:14:14.498
Shri Mataji: Hm? Yogi: They are not well
treated, animals in general

01:14:14.699 --> 01:14:16.375
are not well treated.
Shri Mataji: They?

01:14:16.576 --> 01:14:20.919
Yogi: They are very badly treated, You
know? Shri Mataji: Badly treated.

01:14:21.143 --> 01:14:27.632
Because, you see, they have become little
insensitive to animals, I think so.

01:14:27.834 --> 01:14:30.870
Like here people treat the dogs very
kindly,

01:14:31.071 --> 01:14:34.974
but their children very unkindly.
Is the other way round.

01:14:35.175 --> 01:14:39.400
I mean, it’s - just don’t understand, it’s
a mystery as I said.

01:15:02.342 --> 01:15:05.058
Those who want to see me, can come.

01:15:05.259 --> 01:15:10.514
Tomorrow evening I’ll be at home.

01:15:12.371 --> 01:15:14.835
All right?

01:15:16.463 --> 01:15:19.689
About, say, six o’clock.

01:15:20.071 --> 01:15:25.298
Then Sahasrara Puja must be fixed in the
evening, so that everybody can make it.

01:15:25.499 --> 01:15:29.604
Say about seven o’clock, that would be
good.

01:15:29.805 --> 01:15:35.126
Many people can come there – evening
because it’s a Wednesday or something.

01:15:35.358 --> 01:15:39.511
It’s a Wednesday? [Gavin: “Yes”] So Tuesday-
Wednesday Thursday- Friday, perhaps?

01:15:39.712 --> 01:15:43.165
Gavin: No, it’s a Wednesday.
Shri Mataji: It’s a Wednesday?

01:15:43.857 --> 01:15:45.947
Are you sure?

01:15:46.147 --> 01:15:49.021
Because if second is Tuesday…
Gavin: No, second is Sunday.

01:15:49.222 --> 01:15:52.294
Shri Mataji: Hm? Second is Tuesday.
Gavin: No, it’s Sunday.

01:15:52.495 --> 01:15:55.790
Shri Mataji: Is a Sunday. Then it’s all
right, Wednesday.

01:15:55.991 --> 01:16:00.932
So one should try to have it about seven
o’clock,

01:16:01.133 --> 01:16:04.076
so that others can come in for the puja.

01:16:04.277 --> 01:16:07.845
Now, is it over? Or…

01:16:09.036 --> 01:16:12.681
Yogi: … John Glower is here, and he’s
supposed to be …

01:16:12.882 --> 01:16:16.190
Shri Mataji: Where is he?

01:16:18.465 --> 01:16:21.726
So we can start the puja business because
otherwise it will get very late.

01:16:21.927 --> 01:16:27.152
All right? [Yogi: “Yes.”] When you, when
you get it…

01:16:27.379 --> 01:16:31.523
Yogi: …called Sahaja. Sahaja comes from
Indian language and it means

01:16:31.724 --> 01:16:35.403
“born with you”, or “spontaneous”, because
essentially Yoga

01:16:35.604 --> 01:16:39.323
isn’t just something that allows to keep
fit as has become in the West now.

01:16:39.524 --> 01:16:43.052
Yoga means union, union of your Self and
your Spirit,

01:16:43.253 --> 01:16:50.345
or of your Spirit and the Great Spirit,
which is the Divine, or God (…).

01:16:50.546 --> 01:16:54.504
And in that in fact your Spirit – which
again people nowadays

01:16:54.705 --> 01:16:56.813
don’t even know exists, most of them
usually feel embarrassed

01:16:57.014 --> 01:17:00.212
when you talk about souls and Spirit,
in fact is a reality.

01:17:00.436 --> 01:17:04.499
It is that within which is the true nature,

01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:10.242
its qualities are pure bliss, pure
consciousness and truth.

01:17:10.443 --> 01:17:15.887
And if one can experience that Spirit
consciously, then obviously

01:17:16.110 --> 01:17:19.045
one can be a very blissful person and not
have the problems that most people have.

01:17:19.246 --> 01:17:22.802
The question is: how do you get it? And
Sahaja means it is spontaneous,

01:17:23.010 --> 01:17:27.489
in other words something now for the first
time has made spontaneous

01:17:27.690 --> 01:17:33.173
Self-Realization, or knowing yourself fully
possible for the first time.

01:17:33.374 --> 01:17:35.259
Interviewer: You say “something”. Just
what is this something?

01:17:35.459 --> 01:17:40.550
Yogi: This something is the fact that in
the sacrum bone,

01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:44.927
which is the bone at the base of the spine,
is a being,

01:17:45.128 --> 01:17:48.536
that we call Kundalini, people in the East
call it as Kundalini.

01:17:48.736 --> 01:17:53.298
The Christians also have come across it,
but they called it Holy Spirit.

01:17:53.499 --> 01:17:55.890
Jesus has talked about it too. And …
Interviewer: The fact that the Christians

01:17:56.091 --> 01:17:58.536
that it is in the bone, they wouldn’t like.
Yogi: No, they wouldn’t, no, they wouldn’t

01:17:58.737 --> 01:18:01.199
but nevertheless Christ talked about it,
that’s the essential thing,

01:18:01.399 --> 01:18:05.270
not that the Christians would necessarily;
but rather what Christ said.

01:18:05.471 --> 01:18:13.429
Now, somehow this being, which is
the Divine inside,

01:18:13.630 --> 01:18:19.624
has to link up the individual Spirit - we
say the Atma, the personal Spirit -

01:18:19.825 --> 01:18:24.041
with the One, the Divine, right? And
the way that happens

01:18:24.242 --> 01:18:29.791
is that the Kundalini rises up the spine,
enlightens Spirit,

01:18:29.992 --> 01:18:34.164
and pierces – it goes to actually seven
subtle centres called chakras –

01:18:34.372 --> 01:18:36.778
which I will tell about in a minute if you
like –

01:18:36.979 --> 01:18:40.673
until it pierces the fontanel bone on top
of the head,

01:18:40.874 --> 01:18:42.967
this top chakra, the top center.

01:18:43.168 --> 01:18:46.360
When that happens, the personal spiritual
reality inside,

01:18:46.561 --> 01:18:49.251
which is the Spirit and the subtle centres
and the Kundalini,

01:18:49.452 --> 01:18:52.318
which is latent if you like Divine power
within,

01:18:52.519 --> 01:18:55.799
all are brought into the conscious nervous
system for the first time.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.978
Interviewer: If this is there, or has been
there all the time,

01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:00.891
why is it that it hasn’t happened before?
Yogi: Why it hasn’t happened before,

01:19:01.092 --> 01:19:03.433
well, it happened before in a few cases,

01:19:03.634 --> 01:19:07.222
there have been enlightened people who were
great saints,

01:19:07.423 --> 01:19:09.878
people with immense courage and spiritual
power

01:19:10.079 --> 01:19:11.937
who did have their Self-Realisation before,

01:19:12.137 --> 01:19:15.921
I mean you could say that Lord Buddha
was a man

01:19:16.129 --> 01:19:19.852
who, because of his great perfection,
attained his spiritual life,

01:19:20.053 --> 01:19:21.854
in other words the Kundalini came up fully,

01:19:22.055 --> 01:19:25.214
and he was totally as we’d say
God-realised, in other words

01:19:25.422 --> 01:19:28.952
he became a hollow personality flowing
as if played through, his ego just went,

01:19:29.153 --> 01:19:32.554
as well as his conditionings went, and he
was just as the Spirit.

01:19:32.770 --> 01:19:35.227
And now it happens to anybody, and this is
the main thing,

01:19:35.428 --> 01:19:38.295
this is the interesting, exciting and
thoroughly enjoyable thing;

01:19:38.496 --> 01:19:41.795
but now, it isn’t a case that just a few
sages go and live on a mountain

01:19:41.996 --> 01:19:43.976
in a pure, absolutely perfect knowledge

01:19:44.177 --> 01:19:47.651
may at the end of all [unclear] time
get their Self-Realisation:

01:19:47.852 --> 01:19:51.131
now, any of us who desire it, any of us
who are seeking it,

01:19:51.331 --> 01:19:53.881
genuine seekers can get their
Self-Realisation.

01:19:54.082 --> 01:19:57.361
And the reason for that is that an Indian
lady, called Mataji,

01:19:57.561 --> 01:19:59.913
Her Holiness Mataji Nirmala Devi,

01:20:00.114 --> 01:20:04.923
has come absolutely foremost to give
this gift of Self-Realisation,

01:20:05.131 --> 01:20:07.791
by which – not that She is a guru who has
come just to,

01:20:07.992 --> 01:20:11.129
you know, have people sit at Her feet,
and pay money and so on;

01:20:11.330 --> 01:20:13.731
on the contrary, She said you can’t pay
for the Divine,

01:20:13.932 --> 01:20:18.514
you can’t pay for your Yoga, your Union
with your Spirit and God.

01:20:18.715 --> 01:20:23.628
It happens spontaneously, and the reason
it happens, is because in Her presence

01:20:23.829 --> 01:20:28.439
vibrations which come from Her, or even
from the photograph of Her,

01:20:28.648 --> 01:20:31.465
come in through the upper side
of the hands,

01:20:31.666 --> 01:20:35.564
and that acts as a trigger for
the Kundalini which is residing,

01:20:35.765 --> 01:20:38.386
which as you say we don’t know about,
which may have been there –

01:20:38.587 --> 01:20:41.960
is there nevertheless whether we know
about it or not - at the base of the spine.

01:20:42.161 --> 01:20:44.805
This rises up and that cool breeze,

01:20:45.012 --> 01:20:46.672
what you feel as cool breeze in your hands,
all right?

01:20:46.873 --> 01:20:49.532
Vibrations flowing from Mataji
in full-fledged form –

01:20:49.733 --> 01:20:53.059
the Kundalini then comes up and you begin
to feel things in your…

01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:55.710
Interviewer: There are many people that - do you know that the real fact is,

01:20:55.911 --> 01:20:56.877
and I have to say this…
Yogi: Yes.

01:20:57.078 --> 01:20:59.153
Interviewer: …is that there are lots and
lots of people

01:20:59.353 --> 01:21:01.241
who are saying very similar types
of things;

01:21:01.465 --> 01:21:08.048
and also lots of people, let’s have it,
just… (indistinct words), you know.

01:21:08.249 --> 01:21:11.843
What’s the difference between this one
and the rest? Yogi: Right.

01:21:12.044 --> 01:21:13.703
There are lots of differences, but
admittedly,

01:21:13.904 --> 01:21:17.557
because of the age we’re living in, because
there are so many things around,

01:21:17.758 --> 01:21:23.170
some of which have been absolutely proved
by psychologists and other people,

01:21:23.371 --> 01:21:27.249
just intelligent people, to be absolutely
dangerous and damaging to people.

01:21:27.450 --> 01:21:29.683
That has to tell you the difference,
you have to have a discernment.

01:21:29.884 --> 01:21:33.353
Discernment, as I said beforehand is that
you have to judge Mataji,

01:21:33.553 --> 01:21:37.663
you have to judge Sahaja Yoga on what you
feel about it I suppose, right?

01:21:37.864 --> 01:21:40.708
Before your Realisation. And also using
consent.

01:21:40.947 --> 01:21:44.215
But Mataji’s message is this: you can’t pay
for the Divine, absolutely not,

01:21:44.416 --> 01:21:46.946
it’s satanic to try and pay for the Divine.

01:21:47.170 --> 01:21:50.563
Secondly, if a thing is genuine, you are
not going to get bad side effects,

01:21:50.764 --> 01:21:53.521
you are not going to feel ill: if a thing
is holy and is good and pure

01:21:53.722 --> 01:21:58.780
you’ll feel good; and it will be obvious in
your whole personality (indistinct words).

01:21:58.981 --> 01:22:01.799
And equally,

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:06.656
you can’t come to this spiritual
Realisation, or God you could say,

01:22:06.857 --> 01:22:09.800
or your Spirit or the truth, you can’t come
to that

01:22:10.024 --> 01:22:14.030
on a path which is unrighteous, you can’t
come to that on a path

01:22:14.230 --> 01:22:19.762
of unholiness, of immorality, or
of extreme behaviour.

01:22:19.964 --> 01:22:23.124
Interviewer: But you know, there are lots
of others who tell exactly the same words.

01:22:23.325 --> 01:22:25.563
Then  what’s the difference between
yourselves and say Raja Yoga?

01:22:25.764 --> 01:22:27.128
Now they don’t get money either.

01:22:27.336 --> 01:22:29.107
Yogi: The fact is that we have the actual
happening,

01:22:29.307 --> 01:22:31.845
which you can feel inside yourself, you
feel the cool breeze.

01:22:32.046 --> 01:22:35.469
When you get Realisation, and anybody
gets it - you don’t have to pay for it -

01:22:35.670 --> 01:22:38.973
you feel the cool breeze in your hands
coming from the picture or from Mataji.

01:22:39.181 --> 01:22:41.207
As soon as you actually feel, and you have
to verify for yourself,

01:22:41.414 --> 01:22:43.993
and you might say “there’s a cool breeze”,
doesn’t make a cool breeze;

01:22:44.194 --> 01:22:46.741
but if you feel the cool breeze you can’t
really deny it.

01:22:46.942 --> 01:22:49.181
Secondly, you feel cool which comes out
of your head,

01:22:49.382 --> 01:22:51.588
when you get Realisation, not before.

01:22:51.789 --> 01:22:55.812
Thirdly, you begin to feel all this
extremely subtle, very sensitive

01:22:56.013 --> 01:23:00.836
and beautifully made creation which is
the human personality.

01:23:01.037 --> 01:23:04.468
You begin to feel its subtleties.
Interviewer: Where does this all lead us?

01:23:04.669 --> 01:23:07.662
Where is it going to take us? Yogi: It
takes us into the future, absolutely,

01:23:07.863 --> 01:23:11.054
or you could say into the present; it takes
you to yourself.

01:23:11.255 --> 01:23:15.551
When the Kundalini goes through the second
to the top chakra - the sixth chakra,

01:23:15.752 --> 01:23:17.846
you come into the present and you enter
a state

01:23:18.047 --> 01:23:20.570
of thoughtless awareness, spontaneously.
It’s absolutely natural,

01:23:20.771 --> 01:23:23.316
it just happens, when the Kundalini
reaches that point.

01:23:23.517 --> 01:23:30.599
The reason for that is that, suppose you
are thinking,

01:23:30.815 --> 01:23:34.804
you can’t possibly be in the present, you
can’t be aware of the actually present.

01:23:35.005 --> 01:23:37.367
You can be aware of just what’s just
passed,

01:23:37.568 --> 01:23:39.437
or what’s going to happen in a very short
time,

01:23:39.638 --> 01:23:41.885
but you can’t be aware of the absolute
present.

01:23:42.086 --> 01:23:45.406
So the only way to be in the present,
absolutely, is to be thoughtless,

01:23:45.607 --> 01:23:50.723
and the Kundalini does this, when it
crosses that point on the forehead.

01:23:50.924 --> 01:23:54.266
Then you just become thoughtlessly aware
and we are in that state all the time.

01:23:54.467 --> 01:23:57.606
All we do is in that state. It sounds
strange, but it’s a reality.

01:23:57.807 --> 01:24:00.580
The cares go, the troubles go, your
problems go, as these chakras

01:24:00.781 --> 01:24:03.361
get cleared out by the Kundalini rising up,

01:24:03.562 --> 01:24:06.319
it clears out all the awful things that
cause the problems;

01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:10.245
and you become in the end a joyful being.

01:24:10.446 --> 01:24:13.076
Interviewer: And should you be interested,
She is holding a meeting at Caxton Hall

01:24:13.277 --> 01:24:19.820
on Wednesday the fourteenth of April
at 7pm, everyone is welcome.

01:24:33.728 --> 01:24:37.700
Yogi: This is what was just set up before
doing that.

01:24:39.836 --> 01:24:46.956
Shri Mataji: Ah? Now, the one point that’s
very important to be said

01:24:47.157 --> 01:24:53.074
on such interview, you see, is that you
become empowered by your own powers.

01:24:53.275 --> 01:24:58.146
You yourself know, you can feel it,
the other person, you can feel yourself

01:24:58.347 --> 01:25:03.970
and you know how to maneuver, you see,
this Kundalini of others;

01:25:04.171 --> 01:25:06.279
you can give Realisations to others;

01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:10.288
you can cure others; your power is
released.

01:25:10.489 --> 01:25:14.741
Your power of your Spirit is released
on your central nervous system.

01:25:14.949 --> 01:25:17.357
That would be really convincing; that is
not my power,

01:25:17.558 --> 01:25:20.898
it’s your own power you can feel.

01:25:21.896 --> 01:25:26.214
Yogini: Mother, it seems, through talking
of other groups,

01:25:26.415 --> 01:25:29.528
they do all say very much the same
as we do,

01:25:29.729 --> 01:25:34.756
but the only thing that we should say –
really has to be convincingly -

01:25:34.957 --> 01:25:38.210
is that we do have such powers.
Shri Mataji: That’s it.

01:25:38.411 --> 01:25:40.245
Yogini: That’s it.
Shri Mataji: Just talking is very easy.

01:25:40.445 --> 01:25:43.262
You see, if read some books, they talk.

01:25:43.463 --> 01:25:46.670
See, they read a Sahaj Yoga book, they can
say, “I have a Kundalini awakening.

01:25:46.871 --> 01:25:49.563
I can see the chakras. I can…” All right,
say!

01:25:49.764 --> 01:25:53.059
Ask them, “Can you feel our chakras?”
[Yogi: “That’s all.”]

01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:57.747
That’s all. Then what do they agree?

01:25:57.948 --> 01:26:01.959
Then what do they say; are they going
to come?

01:26:02.571 --> 01:26:04.228
Yogini: Some of them have done, yes,
Mother, we were...

01:26:04.429 --> 01:26:06.698
Shri Mataji: I think you should go and meet
them, again and again.

01:26:06.899 --> 01:26:09.950
(Yogini: “Yes, Mother.”) You see,
Amar Samati asked –

01:26:10.151 --> 01:26:14.014
he went to Santa Cruz, absolutely a new
place.

01:26:14.215 --> 01:26:16.550
And he met people and talked to them and
told them,

01:26:16.751 --> 01:26:20.608
“See, you are not feeling anything, why are
you adhering to any group, for what?

01:26:20.809 --> 01:26:24.318
For paying money? For what? Because you
have been doing it,

01:26:24.519 --> 01:26:26.762
but you are not feeling any vibrations,
nothing;

01:26:26.962 --> 01:26:30.818
you are not feeling anything, you have
no powers.” And he convinced them.

01:26:31.019 --> 01:26:33.567
And he said, “There will be at least five
to six hundred people,” and there were –

01:26:33.768 --> 01:26:37.461
more than that, for that programme.

01:26:37.662 --> 01:26:39.363
That’s what you have to go and tell them,
“What have you got?

01:26:39.564 --> 01:26:42.280
You haven’t got any powers. We have,
we can feel you.

01:26:42.481 --> 01:26:47.139
We know this is what, this is your chakra
is here, that is there.” That’s the thing.

01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:51.547
Yogini: Mother, there is a very funny
story, we went to see some Buddhists,

01:26:51.748 --> 01:26:55.566
and I asked one of them (...) what
enlightenment was.

01:26:55.767 --> 01:26:58.341
Shri Mataji: Hm. Yogini: And he gave me
a very flurry answer.

01:26:58.542 --> 01:27:03.265
And I said to him, “Do you think you will
get it in this lifetime?”

01:27:03.466 --> 01:27:06.380
And he says: “Oh I don’t know, I think it
might be possible.”

01:27:06.581 --> 01:27:09.521
And I said, “Well, how would you know it
when you get it?”

01:27:09.722 --> 01:27:12.616
He said, “Oh, I suppose it will dawn on me
one day.”

01:27:12.817 --> 01:27:14.874
And as he said that, his Kundalini came up!

01:27:15.090 --> 01:27:16.416
Shri Mataji: It will what, it will what?

01:27:16.617 --> 01:27:19.181
Yogini: He said, “I suppose it will dawn
on me one day.”

01:27:19.405 --> 01:27:22.993
And as he said it his Kundalini came up.

01:27:26.279 --> 01:27:28.730
Shri Mataji: Good.

01:27:32.190 --> 01:27:35.494
I’m also sending – you see these… Somehow,
with my husband’s job,

01:27:35.695 --> 01:27:39.242
I meet people who are seekers and who are
placed at the helm of affairs.

01:27:39.443 --> 01:27:41.018
I’m sending them books, you see?

01:27:41.219 --> 01:27:47.999
And I want to send one of the, one of our
books, to Indonesia.

01:27:48.207 --> 01:27:50.907
There’s an ambassador from Indonesia
who’s very anxious,

01:27:51.108 --> 01:27:54.119
so he has been writing to my husband that,
“You haven’t sent the book as yet.”

01:27:54.319 --> 01:27:57.366
So we’ll have to send it there.

01:28:05.999 --> 01:28:08.713
Yogini: Mother, Warren has sent this
cassette up,

01:28:08.914 --> 01:28:12.947
it’s the first VHS copy of the…
(inaudible audio)

01:28:17.234 --> 01:28:22.494
Shri Mataji: Oh all right, let’s see.
Can we see here?

01:28:30.625 --> 01:28:34.111
I don’t know what nail paint these people
have put, I don’t know.

01:28:34.334 --> 01:28:40.078
Indian. Doesn’t go with any English
nail paint remover.

01:28:40.278 --> 01:28:42.955
Can you believe it?

01:28:44.718 --> 01:28:48.389
Shines, though…

01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:57.152
I’ll just come back from -

01:28:57.542 --> 01:29:02.069
It’s a good one, no doubt. And it’s come
out very well.

01:29:18.122 --> 01:29:21.607
…and also it shakes a little bit, but
doesn’t matter,

01:29:21.808 --> 01:29:23.686
but doesn’t matter, we can’t help it,
you see,

01:29:23.902 --> 01:29:30.679
because originals we have in any case
and, but these must be transferred.

01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:33.951
But all the new ones should be done
on VHS, you see.

01:29:34.152 --> 01:29:36.708
That’s a better new system to use, you see?

01:29:36.924 --> 01:29:43.218
That’s a better idea I think, than to use
the, that one and then transfer it.

01:29:43.418 --> 01:29:47.318
It’s quite good, I mean, as far as …
I mean, it gives - it fits all right,

01:29:47.518 --> 01:29:49.502
but could be better if you have direct.

01:29:49.703 --> 01:29:54.093
But as it is we don’t want them to be lost,
everybody would like to hear,

01:29:54.294 --> 01:29:57.054
and some of them are very powerful
in Houston and all that.

01:29:57.255 --> 01:30:00.719
Have you got Houston one here?

01:30:00.982 --> 01:30:03.516
Gavin: There is at least one Houston,
Mother, I don’t know where it is now,

01:30:03.717 --> 01:30:06.452
maybe Warren will send.
Shri Mataji: Alright, so ask him

01:30:06.653 --> 01:30:11.856
to send some Houston things for people
to see, they were very powerful.

01:30:12.065 --> 01:30:14.465
Specially on Christ I spoke very well.

01:30:14.698 --> 01:30:22.003
And why don’t you send this one
to Houston people,

01:30:22.268 --> 01:30:25.824
the one on the Easter day, will be good
idea, you see?

01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:33.284
And if he wants to hear also, Mr. Tricky
Fellow, he could, you see.

01:30:33.485 --> 01:30:39.205
No wonder, because of pressures on him,
you see?

01:30:39.451 --> 01:30:42.635
You see, that is being a cult, it will
become a cult,

01:30:42.835 --> 01:30:47.684
Unity Church will become a cult once
he starts tolerating everything.

01:30:47.885 --> 01:30:50.200
Just write to him that, “You’ll become
a cult then,

01:30:50.401 --> 01:30:53.659
you don’t become a living church.

01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:59.716
The living things know how to discard,
what to accept.”

01:31:01.082 --> 01:31:03.911
Please sit down.

01:31:07.356 --> 01:31:10.810
Yogi: Excuse me, Mother, is this light
disturbing You?

01:31:11.011 --> 01:31:13.850
Shri Mataji: This is what?
Yogi: Do you mind this light on?

01:31:14.051 --> 01:31:17.496
Shri Mataji: I didn’t see it!
Yogi: Oh.

01:31:21.481 --> 01:31:23.410
Shri Mataji: I think this gives a better
picture. Yogi: It does.

01:31:23.610 --> 01:31:27.381
Shri Mataji: It does. Yes.

01:31:30.882 --> 01:31:35.149
You can get people from say Lille have
come,

01:31:35.358 --> 01:31:39.820
who else from – London, you see,
the new people,

01:31:40.021 --> 01:31:42.462
if they don’t come forward, then how will I
know them, you see,

01:31:42.662 --> 01:31:45.219
some of the new people whom I’ve not met
should come forward,

01:31:45.419 --> 01:31:49.100
you see, will be good idea. You must tell
your names to me and…

01:31:49.301 --> 01:31:53.175
[Yogi: “Gary”]. What’s it? [Yogi: “Gary”]
Gareth. [Yogi: “Gary”]

01:31:53.376 --> 01:31:58.191
Gary, Gary, all right. Gary.

01:32:04.672 --> 01:32:08.250
Anybody else from Lille? Patrick, you can
come along.

01:32:08.450 --> 01:32:12.652
You come along – now, what’s your name?
Christopher.

01:32:12.853 --> 01:32:15.922
Christopher I don’t know. Christopher
and Gary.

01:32:16.123 --> 01:32:20.280
Now, who else is there?

01:32:20.481 --> 01:32:23.349
A new one? Come along. Patrick you
come, and you come along.

01:32:23.549 --> 01:32:28.020
You also come, because you’ve come
from outside.

01:32:30.196 --> 01:32:34.089
Hilary, is it all right? You’ve changed
a little bit, is it all right?

01:32:34.290 --> 01:32:37.045
[Yogini: “Yes, Mother”] Little bit,
because you see,

01:32:37.246 --> 01:32:39.799
it’s no use going up and down
[Yogini: “Yes”],

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.447
so is best is to finish with Norwich,
[Yogini: “Yes, Mother”]

01:32:42.648 --> 01:32:44.552
and then be in Cambridge [Yogini: “Yes”].

01:32:44.753 --> 01:32:48.722
Yogini: Mother, did I understand you were
going to spend two evenings in Cambridge,

01:32:48.923 --> 01:32:51.299
and then the puja the following day.
Shri Mataji: Yes.

01:32:51.499 --> 01:32:53.878
[Yogini: “Or is it one evening?”] No, no,
that’s how, that’s how, that’s what it is.

01:32:54.079 --> 01:32:57.026
[Yogini: “Two programmes”] 18th at Norwich
[Yogini: “Yes”]

01:32:57.227 --> 01:33:01.228
and 19th and 20th Cambridge
[Yogini: “Yes”],

01:33:01.429 --> 01:33:06.206
and 21st the Puja. 21st is a Sunday, isn’t
it? Yogini: I hope so, Mother, yes.

01:33:06.407 --> 01:33:08.769
Shri Mataji: I hope so, [Yogini: “Yes”]
because you see,

01:33:08.969 --> 01:33:11.662
some people will have to come from here
for Puja. [Yogini: “Yes, Mother”]

01:33:11.863 --> 01:33:15.880
Just find out, is it a Sunday, 21st?

01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:22.378
All right. Come along, come forward.

01:33:29.076 --> 01:33:31.012
Yogi: No, it’s a Monday.
Shri Mataji: Ah.

01:33:31.222 --> 01:33:34.994
I would say David, you come along,
David Prole,

01:33:35.195 --> 01:33:40.220
please come along, to wash my feet.
And Kay, Kay?

01:33:40.421 --> 01:33:43.401
The other Kay, come along, yes. Good.

01:33:47.704 --> 01:33:51.248
And Samson, where is he? Oh…

01:33:51.934 --> 01:33:57.055
I call him Samson, his name is Simon
I always call him Samson.

01:33:57.596 --> 01:34:02.047
I can’t forget Samson, you know, nobody is
a Samson here, just imagine!

01:34:02.247 --> 01:34:06.248
Yogi: Caleb, Mother. Shri Mataji: Eh?
Yogi: Caleb. Caleb’s the one, Mother.

01:34:06.449 --> 01:34:10.489
Shri Mataji: Who? [Yogis: “Caleb”]
He is Samson? Who is Samson?

01:34:10.690 --> 01:34:16.059
Yogi: Magda’s son, Caleb.
Shri Mataji: Caleb is Samson?

01:34:16.377 --> 01:34:19.298
I didn’t know!

01:34:26.266 --> 01:34:30.370
So Maria, what is it now, next year will
you do for Greece, hm?

01:34:30.571 --> 01:34:36.126
Maria: Next year, as You wish Mother, we
can do it this year if You like.

01:34:36.327 --> 01:34:40.426
Shri Mataji: I think it’s too early. We’ll
have to go, prepare, do something there…

01:34:40.627 --> 01:34:43.138
Maria: We have to go at least one month
in advance, Mother,

01:34:43.339 --> 01:34:46.860
before You come, to prepare something.
Shri Mataji: Yes.

01:34:47.068 --> 01:34:51.576
Maria: And then we’ll have to stay after …
in order to establish something.

01:34:51.777 --> 01:34:57.550
Shri Mataji: You’ll have to stick on there.
Maria: I have written to Maria (Fujami?)

01:34:57.751 --> 01:35:01.883
and I have not received an answer yet,
inviting her to come over here.

01:35:02.083 --> 01:35:04.819
Shri Mataji: That’s what I’m saying.
Now come along,

01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:07.943
you both can wash my feet first of all.

01:35:08.144 --> 01:35:13.686
One by one, so this space is given to
others to also come along.

01:35:13.887 --> 01:35:16.906
You just move on.

01:35:17.106 --> 01:35:19.710
Let it be now, it’s not ready, just good,
you see,

01:35:19.911 --> 01:35:23.888
you can put it on one side, this one put it
on the here.

01:35:28.706 --> 01:35:34.706
Now you can light it. You both come along
first of all to wash my feet.

01:35:34.907 --> 01:35:38.999
Now what I’m saying, somebody who has
to put the water should be here,

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:42.972
and Gavin, you better guide what is to be
read and what is to be done.

01:35:43.173 --> 01:35:46.090
Now come along, both of you come. One
of you should drop the -

01:35:46.291 --> 01:35:50.645
yes, you put the water, come along, she can
do it, come that side.

01:35:50.846 --> 01:35:56.050
Now you, be careful, that’s all fallen off.
Yes.

01:35:57.646 --> 01:36:02.682
Why don’t you put the light at the back
there, somebody can gradually - with care,

01:36:02.883 --> 01:36:06.338
somebody with great care has to do it,
there’s oil in it,

01:36:06.539 --> 01:36:10.232
it’s very heavy, it’s very heavy!

01:36:13.804 --> 01:36:17.619
Now, come along. Yes.

01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:21.100
Would be better if you put it there and
then light it.

01:36:21.301 --> 01:36:24.913
Put it right first of all. I think Marcus
knows how to do it, Marcus?

01:36:25.121 --> 01:36:28.665
Come along. Yes. You come along, you also.

01:36:28.866 --> 01:36:32.151
What about your watch, is it all right?
Good.

01:36:32.352 --> 01:36:38.690
Wipe - now rub it, rub hard, rub hard,
rub it hard.

01:36:52.190 --> 01:36:56.877
Where is the matchbox? With sahaja yogis
you won’t find matchboxes!

01:36:58.450 --> 01:37:02.272
Rub it hard. Yes.

01:37:22.476 --> 01:37:25.879
They have offered it now. No need of…

01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:28.502
Yogi: Say all Mother’s mantras.

01:37:28.703 --> 01:37:35.910
Om Twameva Sakshat, Shri Mahalakshmi,

01:37:36.111 --> 01:37:41.383
Mahasaraswati, Mahakali,

01:37:41.636 --> 01:37:46.802
Trigunatmika, Kundalini Sakshat,

01:37:47.003 --> 01:37:50.511
Shri Adi Shakti Sakshat,

01:37:50.725 --> 01:37:56.438
Shri Bhagavati Sakshat, Shri Mataji,

01:37:56.639 --> 01:38:03.072
Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

01:38:03.273 --> 01:38:10.340
Om Twameva Sakshat, Shri Kalki Sakshat,

01:38:10.541 --> 01:38:14.108
Shri Adi Shakti Sakshat,

01:38:14.309 --> 01:38:19.931
Shri Bhagavati Sakshat, Shri Mataji,

01:38:20.132 --> 01:38:26.506
Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

01:38:26.707 --> 01:38:33.690
Om Twameva Sakshat, Shri Kalki Sakshat,
Shri Mataji: See now.

01:38:33.891 --> 01:38:37.039
Shri Sahasrara Swamini

01:38:37.239 --> 01:38:41.399
Moksha Pradayini Mataji

01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:48.772
Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

01:38:48.972 --> 01:38:53.163
Shri Mataji: [Aside to the person] May God
bless you. Now let them come here.

01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:06.145
Rub it hard. Here. Void.

01:39:06.361 --> 01:39:09.203
[Gospel of Matthew: 6,1-6.16-18]
Then Christ said unto his disciples:

01:39:09.404 --> 01:39:13.431
²Therefore, when thou doest thine alms,
do not sound a trumpet before thee,

01:39:13.632 --> 01:39:16.446
as the hypocrites do in the synagogues
and in the streets

01:39:16.647 --> 01:39:18.665
that they may have glory of men.

01:39:18.866 --> 01:39:22.077
Verily I say unto you, They have their
reward.

01:39:22.278 --> 01:39:27.293
³But when thou doest alms, let not thy left
hand know what thy right hand doeth

01:39:27.494 --> 01:39:31.861
⁴that thine alms may be in secret; and thy
Father which sees thee in secret,

01:39:32.062 --> 01:39:35.434
himself shall reward thee openly.

01:39:35.635 --> 01:39:39.410
⁵And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be
as the hypocrites are,

01:39:39.611 --> 01:39:41.551
for they love to pray standing
in the synagogues

01:39:41.752 --> 01:39:45.414
and in the corners of the streets that they
may be seen of men.

01:39:45.615 --> 01:39:48.487
Verily I say unto you, They have their
reward.

01:39:48.688 --> 01:39:52.413
⁶But thou, when thou prayest, enter
into thy closet,

01:39:52.614 --> 01:39:56.458
and when thou hast shut thy door, pray
to thy Father which is in secret;

01:39:56.659 --> 01:40:00.636
and thy Father which sees thee in secret
shall reward thee openly.

01:40:00.837 --> 01:40:04.911
⁷But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions
as the heathen do,

01:40:05.112 --> 01:40:08.445
for they think that they shall be heard
for their much speaking.

01:40:08.646 --> 01:40:11.997
⁸Be not ye therefore like unto them,
for your Father knows

01:40:12.198 --> 01:40:15.357
what things ye have need of before
ye ask him.

01:40:15.558 --> 01:40:18.844
⁹After this manner pray therefore:

01:40:19.045 --> 01:40:23.712
Our Father who are in heavens,
Hallowed be thy name.

01:40:23.913 --> 01:40:25.812
¹⁰Thy kingdom come.

01:40:26.058 --> 01:40:30.456
Thy will be done in earth, as it is
in heaven.

01:40:30.657 --> 01:40:36.228
¹¹Give us this day our daily bread and
forgive us our trespasses,

01:40:36.445 --> 01:40:40.111
as we forgive those who trespass
against us;

01:40:40.312 --> 01:40:45.588
¹³And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil,

01:40:45.789 --> 01:40:49.967
for thine is the kingdom, the power
and the glory,

01:40:50.167 --> 01:40:54.900
forever and ever. Amen.

01:41:04.574 --> 01:41:06.652
Yogi: From the Gospel of Saint John.

01:41:06.852 --> 01:41:10.098
Shri Mataji: Good. Water… you take out
in… this water.

01:41:11.503 --> 01:41:13.666
¹Now before the feast of the passover,

01:41:13.867 --> 01:41:15.763
when Jesus knew that his hour was come

01:41:15.964 --> 01:41:18.854
that he should depart out of this world
unto the Father,

01:41:19.055 --> 01:41:23.333
having loved his own which were in the
world, he loved them unto the end.

01:41:23.534 --> 01:41:25.654
²And supper being ended,

01:41:25.855 --> 01:41:28.468
the devil having now put into the heart
of Judas Iscariot,

01:41:28.669 --> 01:41:30.866
Simon’s son, to betray him;

01:41:31.067 --> 01:41:34.647
³Jesus knowing that the Father had given
all things into his hands,

01:41:34.848 --> 01:41:38.335
and that he was come from God, and went
to God;

01:41:38.536 --> 01:41:41.485
⁴He riseth from supper, and laid aside
his garments;

01:41:41.686 --> 01:41:44.528
and took a towel, and girded himself.

01:41:44.729 --> 01:41:47.488
⁵After that he poureth water into a bason,

01:41:47.689 --> 01:41:50.291
and began to wash the disciples’ feet,

01:41:50.492 --> 01:41:54.527
and to wipe them with the towel wherewith
he was girded.

01:41:54.728 --> 01:41:58.372
⁶Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter
saith unto him,

01:41:58.573 --> 01:42:01.684
Lord, dost thou wash my feet?

01:42:01.885 --> 01:42:04.004
⁷Jesus answered and said unto him,

01:42:04.205 --> 01:42:09.101
What I do thou knowest not now; but thou
shalt know hereafter.

01:42:09.302 --> 01:42:12.724
⁸Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never
wash my feet.

01:42:12.925 --> 01:42:17.593
Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not,
thou hast no part with me.

01:42:17.802 --> 01:42:20.924
⁹Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord,
not my feet only,

01:42:21.124 --> 01:42:24.029
but also my hands and my head.

01:42:24.230 --> 01:42:28.192
¹⁰Jesus saith unto him, He that is washed

01:42:28.393 --> 01:42:32.433
needeth not save to wash his feet, but
is clean every whit:

01:42:32.634 --> 01:42:35.509
and ye are clean, but not all.

01:42:35.710 --> 01:42:38.870
¹¹For he knew who should betray him;
therefore said he,

01:42:39.071 --> 01:42:41.392
Ye are not all clean.

01:42:41.593 --> 01:42:44.384
¹²So after he had washed their feet, and
had taken his garments,

01:42:44.585 --> 01:42:47.292
and was set down again, he said unto them,

01:42:47.493 --> 01:42:49.517
Know ye what I have done to you?

01:42:49.718 --> 01:42:54.218
¹³Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say
well; for so I am.

01:42:54.419 --> 01:42:57.208
¹⁴If I then, your Lord and Master, have
washed your feet;

01:42:57.409 --> 01:42:59.980
ye also ought to wash one another’s feet.

01:43:00.181 --> 01:43:03.889
¹⁵For I have given you an example, that
ye should do as I have done to you.

01:43:04.090 --> 01:43:06.352
¹⁶Verily, verily, I say unto you,

01:43:06.553 --> 01:43:09.013
The servant is not greater than his lord;

01:43:09.214 --> 01:43:12.557
neither he that is sent greater than he
that sent him.

01:43:12.758 --> 01:43:18.195
¹⁷If ye know these things, happy are ye
if ye do them.

01:43:31.617 --> 01:43:33.581
Other yogi [continues]: ¹⁸I speak not
of you all:

01:43:33.782 --> 01:43:36.484
I know whom I have chosen:

01:43:36.685 --> 01:43:39.361
but that the scripture may be fulfilled,

01:43:39.562 --> 01:43:44.468
He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up
his heel against me.

01:43:44.674 --> 01:43:46.769
¹⁹Now I tell you before it come,

01:43:46.969 --> 01:43:51.868
that, when it is come to pass, ye may
believe that I am he.

01:43:52.069 --> 01:43:55.006
²⁰Verily, verily, I say unto you…
Shri Mataji: Loudly.

01:43:55.207 --> 01:43:58.789
Yogi: He that receiveth whomsoever I send
receiveth me;

01:43:58.990 --> 01:44:03.571
and he that receiveth me receiveth him
that sent me.

01:44:03.772 --> 01:44:07.218
²¹When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled
in spirit,

01:44:07.419 --> 01:44:10.930
and testified, and said, Verily, verily,

01:44:11.131 --> 01:44:15.365
I say unto you, that one of you shall
betray me.

01:44:15.566 --> 01:44:21.322
²²Then the disciples looked upon one
another, doubting of whom he spake.

01:44:21.523 --> 01:44:27.476
²³Now there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom
one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.

01:44:27.677 --> 01:44:29.949
²⁴Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him,

01:44:30.150 --> 01:44:34.253
that he should ask who it should be
of whom he spake.

01:44:34.454 --> 01:44:40.414
²⁵He then lying on Jesus’ breast saith
unto him, Lord, who is it?

01:44:40.615 --> 01:44:44.579
²⁶Jesus answered, He it is, to whom…

01:44:44.780 --> 01:44:46.008
Shri Mataji: Now somebody else should
read, because he has to wash…

01:44:46.208 --> 01:44:48.326
Yogi: I shall give a sop, when I have
dipped it.

01:44:48.527 --> 01:44:51.632
And when he had dipped the sop, he gave
it to Judas Iscariot,

01:44:51.833 --> 01:44:54.696
the son of Simon.

01:44:54.897 --> 01:44:57.152
Shri Mataji: Simon, you come.

01:44:57.353 --> 01:45:01.497
You come, both of you, then David will
do it also.

01:45:01.697 --> 01:45:06.527
He has to wash. Who else is there? David
and who else?

01:45:07.123 --> 01:45:11.812
Let Pat come to join David. Pat is there?
Come along.

01:45:12.012 --> 01:45:15.765
Yes. You wash my feet.

01:45:21.181 --> 01:45:23.863
Rub it hard.

01:45:27.371 --> 01:45:30.320
Other yogi: ²⁷And after the sop Satan
entered into him.

01:45:30.530 --> 01:45:35.636
Then Jesus said unto him, That thou
doest, do quickly.

01:45:35.837 --> 01:45:37.851
²⁸Now no man at the table knew

01:45:38.052 --> 01:45:40.981
for what intent he spake this unto him.

01:45:41.182 --> 01:45:44.528
²⁹For some of them thought, because Judas
had the bag,

01:45:44.729 --> 01:45:48.413
that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those
things

01:45:48.614 --> 01:45:51.432
that we have need of against the feast;

01:45:51.633 --> 01:45:54.737
or, that he should give something
to the poor.

01:45:54.938 --> 01:45:59.733
³⁰He then having received the sop went
immediately out: and it was night.

01:45:59.934 --> 01:46:03.044
³¹Therefore, when he was gone out,
Jesus said,

01:46:03.287 --> 01:46:07.949
Now is the Son of man glorified, and God
is glorified in him.

01:46:08.150 --> 01:46:10.496
³²And if God be glorified in him,

01:46:10.697 --> 01:46:16.829
God shall also glorify him in himself,

01:46:17.030 --> 01:46:19.572
and shall straightway glorify him.

01:46:19.773 --> 01:46:24.007
³³Little children, yet a little while I am
with you.

01:46:24.208 --> 01:46:29.218
Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto
the Jews,

01:46:29.419 --> 01:46:34.587
Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now
I say to you.

01:46:34.788 --> 01:46:37.060
³⁴A new commandment I give unto you,

01:46:37.261 --> 01:46:40.722
That ye shall love one another; as I have
loved you,

01:46:40.923 --> 01:46:44.212
that ye shall also love one another.

01:46:44.413 --> 01:46:48.628
³⁵By this shall all men know that ye are
my disciples,

01:46:48.829 --> 01:46:52.623
if ye have love one to another.

01:46:52.824 --> 01:46:59.066
³⁶Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither
goest thou?

01:46:59.267 --> 01:47:03.200
Jesus answered him, [Whither] I go,

01:47:03.438 --> 01:47:08.661
thou canst not follow me now; but thou
shalt follow me afterwards.

01:47:08.862 --> 01:47:13.559
³⁷Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot
I follow thee now?

01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:16.282
I will lay down my life for thy sake.

01:47:16.485 --> 01:47:21.408
³⁸Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down
thy life for my sake?

01:47:21.609 --> 01:47:24.435
Verily, verily, I say unto thee,

01:47:24.636 --> 01:47:31.948
The cock shall not crow, till thou hast
denied me thrice.

01:47:41.576 --> 01:47:43.363
Shri Mataji: It’s all right. Put it
a little bit…

01:47:43.563 --> 01:47:45.677
Other yogi: ¹Let not your heart be
troubled:

01:47:45.878 --> 01:47:50.285
ye believe in God, believe also in me.

01:47:50.512 --> 01:47:54.752
²In my Father’s house are many mansions:

01:47:54.953 --> 01:47:58.399
if it were not so, I would have told you.

01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:00.877
I go to prepare a place for you.

01:48:01.078 --> 01:48:04.015
³And if I go and prepare a place for you,

01:48:04.250 --> 01:48:08.442
I will come again, and receive you unto
myself;

01:48:08.643 --> 01:48:13.392
that where I am, there ye may be also.

01:48:13.609 --> 01:48:18.803
⁴And whither I go ye know, and the way
ye know.

01:48:19.581 --> 01:48:25.150
⁵Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not
whither thou goest;

01:48:25.351 --> 01:48:28.586
and how can we know the way?

01:48:28.837 --> 01:48:35.527
⁶Jesus saith unto him, I am the way,
the truth, and the life:

01:48:35.728 --> 01:48:40.081
no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

01:48:40.282 --> 01:48:45.206
⁷If ye had known me, ye should have known
my Father also:

01:48:45.407 --> 01:48:50.650
and from henceforth ye know him, and have
seen him.

01:48:51.278 --> 01:48:57.413
Shri Mataji: “Have seen Him”: see, this
point they miss!

01:49:01.576 --> 01:49:07.422
Yogi: ⁸Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us
the Father, and it sufficeth us.

01:49:07.623 --> 01:49:11.275
⁹Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long
with you,

01:49:11.476 --> 01:49:15.398
and yet hast thou not known me, Philip?

01:49:15.599 --> 01:49:18.824
He that hath seen me hath seen the Father;

01:49:19.025 --> 01:49:22.883
and how sayest thou, Show us the Father?

01:49:23.092 --> 01:49:29.279
¹⁰Believest thou not that I am in
the Father, and the Father in me?

01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:33.490
The words that I speak unto you I speak
not of myself:

01:49:33.691 --> 01:49:38.527
but the Father that dwelleth in me,
he doeth the works.

01:49:38.728 --> 01:49:44.084
¹¹Believe me that I am in the Father,
and the Father in me:

01:49:44.285 --> 01:49:49.239
or else believe me for the very
works’ sake.

01:49:49.791 --> 01:49:55.634
¹²Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that
believeth on me,

01:49:55.835 --> 01:50:00.606
the works that I do shall he also do;

01:50:00.807 --> 01:50:06.277
and greater works than these shall he do;
because I go unto my Father.

01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:10.459
¹³And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name,
that will I do,

01:50:10.660 --> 01:50:14.376
that the Father may be glorified
in the Son.

01:50:14.577 --> 01:50:21.432
¹⁴If ye shall ask any thing in my name,
I will do it.

01:50:24.756 --> 01:50:28.247
Shri Mataji: Good, beautiful. Come.
Good, now:

01:50:28.448 --> 01:50:33.730
you can take this water in something
else this side. Take it.

01:50:38.558 --> 01:50:43.290
Take the other one now, better…

01:50:46.583 --> 01:50:50.801
Good. Yogi: ¹⁵If ye love me, keep my
commandments.

01:50:51.002 --> 01:50:56.083
Shri Mataji: Loudly. Yogi: ¹⁵If ye love me,
keep my commandments.

01:50:56.298 --> 01:51:01.475
¹⁶And I will pray the Father, and he shall
give you another Comforter,

01:51:01.718 --> 01:51:05.393
that he may abide with you for ever;

01:51:05.594 --> 01:51:09.627
¹⁷Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world
cannot receive,

01:51:09.828 --> 01:51:13.369
because it seeth him not, neither knoweth
him:

01:51:13.570 --> 01:51:20.381
but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you,
and shall be in you.

01:51:20.582 --> 01:51:25.415
¹⁸I will not leave you comfortless: I will
come to you.

01:51:25.615 --> 01:51:29.912
¹⁹Yet a little while, and the world seeth
me no more;

01:51:30.113 --> 01:51:36.370
but ye see me: because I live, ye shall
live also.

01:51:36.570 --> 01:51:41.044
²⁰At that day ye shall know that I am
in my Father,

01:51:41.244 --> 01:51:45.188
and ye in me, and I in you.

01:51:45.389 --> 01:51:49.097
²¹He that hath my commandments, and
keepeth them,

01:51:49.298 --> 01:51:53.858
he it is that loveth me: and he that
loveth me

01:51:54.059 --> 01:51:56.984
shall be loved of my Father and I will
love him …

01:51:57.185 --> 01:52:00.738
Shri Mataji: See now: First Commandment
he said, that you love each other.

01:52:00.939 --> 01:52:04.239
The disciples must love each other, he
didn’t say any Dick, Tom and Harry.

01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:07.503
First love the disciples, all of you should
love each other,

01:52:07.704 --> 01:52:10.436
that’s the main thing is. First thing
is that.

01:52:10.637 --> 01:52:16.735
Second is, “My father”. See
the relationship.

01:52:17.871 --> 01:52:23.037
Yogi: … and I will love him, and will
manifest myself to him.

01:52:23.238 --> 01:52:27.697
²²Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord,

01:52:27.898 --> 01:52:33.759
how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself
unto us, and not unto the world?

01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:37.657
²³Jesus answered and said unto him,

01:52:37.858 --> 01:52:40.851
If a man love me, he will keep my words:

01:52:41.052 --> 01:52:44.928
and my Father will love him, and we will
come unto him,

01:52:45.128 --> 01:52:48.048
and make our abode with him.

01:52:48.249 --> 01:52:53.140
²⁴He that loveth me not keepeth not
my sayings:

01:52:53.341 --> 01:52:58.512
and the word which ye hear is (not) mine,
but the Father’s which sent me.

01:52:58.713 --> 01:53:03.893
²⁵These things have I spoken unto you,
being yet present with you.

01:53:04.171 --> 01:53:07.651
²⁶But the Comforter, which is the Holy
Ghost,

01:53:07.852 --> 01:53:10.987
whom the Father will send in my name,

01:53:11.188 --> 01:53:15.761
he shall teach you all things, and bring
all things to your remembrance,

01:53:15.962 --> 01:53:19.456
whatsoever I have said unto you.

01:53:19.657 --> 01:53:24.650
²⁷Peace I leave with you, my peace I give
unto you:

01:53:24.861 --> 01:53:28.529
not as the world giveth, give I unto you.

01:53:28.730 --> 01:53:33.661
Let not your heart be troubled, neither
let it be afraid.

01:53:33.862 --> 01:53:36.981
²⁸Ye have heard how I said unto you,
I go away,

01:53:37.182 --> 01:53:41.980
and come again unto you. If ye loved me,

01:53:42.181 --> 01:53:45.802
ye would rejoice, because I said, I go
unto the Father:

01:53:46.003 --> 01:53:49.593
for my Father is greater than I.

01:53:56.798 --> 01:54:00.010
Shri Mataji: Good. Start it with the high
tones, will keep it up, you see.

01:54:00.210 --> 01:54:02.297
The thing is people must hear you.

01:54:02.497 --> 01:54:06.021
Good. Now just see the hands - vibrations.

01:54:06.222 --> 01:54:10.105
Gavin: And now I have told you before
it come to pass,

01:54:10.322 --> 01:54:14.936
that, when it is come to pass, ye might
believe.

01:54:15.137 --> 01:54:17.527
³⁰Hereafter I will not talk much with you:

01:54:17.728 --> 01:54:23.182
for the prince of this world cometh, and
hath nothing in me.

01:54:23.383 --> 01:54:26.719
³¹But that the world may know that I love
the Father;

01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:31.743
and as the Father gave me commandment,
even so I do.

01:54:31.944 --> 01:54:37.279
Shri Mataji: Hm!
Yogi: Arise, let us go hence.

01:54:39.345 --> 01:54:45.419
¹I am the true vine, and my Father is
the husbandman.

01:54:45.620 --> 01:54:51.357
²Every branch in me that beareth not fruit
he taketh away:

01:54:51.558 --> 01:54:55.219
and every branch that beareth fruit,
he purgeth it…

01:54:55.420 --> 01:54:59.914
Shri Mataji: See!
Gavin: …that it may bring forth more fruit.

01:55:00.939 --> 01:55:05.745
³Now ye are clean through the word which
I have spoken unto you.

01:55:05.946 --> 01:55:11.038
⁴Abide in me, and I in you.

01:55:11.239 --> 01:55:16.503
As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself,
except it abide in the vine;

01:55:16.704 --> 01:55:21.603
no more can ye, except ye abide in me.

01:55:21.819 --> 01:55:25.629
⁵I am the vine, ye are the branches:

01:55:25.830 --> 01:55:28.919
He that abideth in me, and I in him,

01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:32.545
the same bringeth forth much fruit:

01:55:32.746 --> 01:55:36.928
for without me ye can do nothing.

01:55:37.691 --> 01:55:43.099
⁶If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth
as a branch, and is withered;

01:55:43.300 --> 01:55:49.201
and men gather them, and cast them into
the fire, and they are burned.

01:55:49.844 --> 01:55:53.587
⁷If ye abide in me, and my words abide
in you,

01:55:53.788 --> 01:55:58.612
ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be
done unto you.

01:55:58.813 --> 01:56:03.534
⁸Herein is my Father glorified, that ye
bear much fruit;

01:56:03.735 --> 01:56:07.643
so shall ye be my disciples.

01:56:08.882 --> 01:56:13.586
⁹As the Father hath loved me, so have I
loved you:

01:56:13.787 --> 01:56:17.198
continue ye in my love.

01:56:17.415 --> 01:56:21.777
¹⁰If ye keep my commandments, ye shall
abide in my love;

01:56:21.994 --> 01:56:28.593
even as I have kept my Father’s
commandments, and abide in his love.

01:56:30.833 --> 01:56:32.558
¹¹These things have I spoken unto you,
Shri Mataji: All right. Now come along.

01:56:32.759 --> 01:56:36.323
Gavin: ... that my joy might remain in you,
Shri Mataji: Now come.

01:56:36.524 --> 01:56:42.025
John and Don. Yes. Just take it ...

01:56:42.226 --> 01:56:46.923
Gavin:  and that your joy might be full.
Shri Mataji: ... in the bowl.

01:56:47.464 --> 01:56:54.227
¹²This is my commandment, That ye love
one another, as I have loved you.

01:56:57.659 --> 01:57:00.619
¹³Greater love hath no man than this,

01:57:00.820 --> 01:57:05.522
that a man lay down his life for his
friends.

01:57:05.723 --> 01:57:11.644
¹⁴Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever
I command you.

01:57:12.804 --> 01:57:15.669
¹⁵Henceforth I call you not servants;

01:57:15.870 --> 01:57:19.674
for the servant knoweth not what his lord
doeth:

01:57:19.890 --> 01:57:22.220
but I have called you friends;

01:57:22.421 --> 01:57:28.796
for all things that I have heard of my
Father I have made known unto you.

01:57:41.769 --> 01:57:48.882
Shri Mataji: Rub it hard. Hard. Hm.
Very hard.

01:57:49.083 --> 01:57:52.440
Yogi: ¹⁶Ye have not chosen me, but I have
chosen you,

01:57:52.641 --> 01:57:56.897
and ordained you, that ye should go forth
and bring forth fruit,

01:57:57.098 --> 01:58:01.286
and that your fruit should remain: that
whatsoever ye shall ask

01:58:01.487 --> 01:58:05.629
of the Father in my name, he may give
it to you.

01:58:05.830 --> 01:58:09.848
¹⁷These things I command you, that ye love
one another.

01:58:10.049 --> 01:58:14.360
¹⁸If the world hate you, ye know that it
hated me before it hated you.

01:58:14.561 --> 01:58:17.633
Shri Mataji: Throughout one Commandment.
Just see. Because He knew

01:58:17.834 --> 01:58:22.487
that if you don’t love each other, nobody
is going to believe you.

01:58:23.226 --> 01:58:28.595
Yogi: ¹⁹If ye were of the world, the world
would love his own:

01:58:28.806 --> 01:58:33.428
but because ye are not of the world, but
I have chosen you out of the world,

01:58:33.636 --> 01:58:36.916
therefore the world hateth you.

01:58:37.117 --> 01:58:39.832
²⁰Remember the word that I said unto you,

01:58:40.033 --> 01:58:43.273
The servant is not greater than his lord.

01:58:43.474 --> 01:58:48.205
If they have persecuted me, they will also
persecute you;

01:58:48.407 --> 01:58:53.569
if they have kept my saying, they will
keep yours also.

01:58:53.770 --> 01:58:58.524
²¹But all these things will they do unto
you for my name’s sake,

01:58:58.744 --> 01:59:02.095
because they know not him that sent me.

01:59:02.296 --> 01:59:08.932
²²If I had not come and spoken unto them,
they had not had sin…

01:59:09.133 --> 01:59:13.201
Shri Mataji: They had…?
Yogi [repeats]: They had not had sin.

01:59:13.402 --> 01:59:17.881
But now they have no cloak for their sin.

01:59:18.406 --> 01:59:22.379
²³He that hateth me hateth my Father also.

01:59:22.580 --> 01:59:27.089
²⁴If I had not done among them the works
which none other man did,

01:59:27.314 --> 01:59:34.795
they had not had sin: but now have they
both

01:59:35.025 --> 01:59:39.160
seen and hated both me and my Father.

01:59:39.361 --> 01:59:41.286
But this cometh to pass,

01:59:41.487 --> 01:59:45.094
that the word might be fulfilled that
is written in their law,

01:59:45.319 --> 01:59:53.217
They hated me without a cause.
Shri Mataji: See. Very true.

01:59:53.649 --> 01:59:58.499
Yogi: ²⁶But when the Comforter is come,
whom I will send unto you from the Father,

01:59:58.700 --> 02:00:02.733
even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth
from the Father,

02:00:02.933 --> 02:00:07.440
he shall testify of me:
Shri Mataji: Spirit of Truth is the point.

02:00:07.649 --> 02:00:13.203
You see, you get the Spirit of Truth and
then testify, you can testify.

02:00:13.404 --> 02:00:15.984
Yogi: ²⁷And ye also shall bear witness,

02:00:16.185 --> 02:00:19.666
because ye have been with me from
the beginning.

02:00:19.867 --> 02:00:22.863
Shri Mataji: From the very beginning.

02:00:25.523 --> 02:00:28.601
Though in Hebrew it may not be he or she,
I think so.

02:00:28.802 --> 02:00:34.440
Not sure, but you see, must be some sort
of a gender person.

02:00:41.329 --> 02:00:45.061
Now stop your movement, just stop it.

02:00:45.269 --> 02:00:52.947
Just keep it steady. Absolutely. Steady it.

02:00:53.190 --> 02:00:55.836
Yogi: ¹These things have I spoken unto you,
Shri Mataji: You still you are moving.

02:00:56.036 --> 02:00:58.193
Yogi: that ye should not be offended.

02:00:58.394 --> 02:01:02.204
²They shall put you out of the synagogues:
yea, the time cometh,

02:01:02.405 --> 02:01:05.444
that whosoever killeth you will think that
he doeth God service.

02:01:05.645 --> 02:01:08.232
[Shri Mataji: “Better. Put your hands
towards me.”] Yogi: ³And these things will

02:01:08.433 --> 02:01:12.329
they do unto you, because they have not
known the Father, nor me.

02:01:12.530 --> 02:01:16.543
⁴But these things have I told you, that
when the time shall come,

02:01:16.744 --> 02:01:19.277
ye may remember that I told you of them.
[Shri Mataji: “All right?”]

02:01:19.478 --> 02:01:24.599
And these things I said not unto you at
the beginning, because I was with you.

02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:28.643
⁵But now I go my way to him that sent me;

02:01:28.844 --> 02:01:32.298
and none of you asketh me, Whither
goest thou?

02:01:32.499 --> 02:01:37.366
⁶But because I have said these things unto
you, sorrow hath filled your heart.

02:01:37.567 --> 02:01:43.061
⁷Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is
expedient for you that I go away:

02:01:43.269 --> 02:01:46.655
for if I go not away, the Comforter will
not come unto you;

02:01:46.856 --> 02:01:50.032
but if I depart, I will send him unto you.

02:01:50.233 --> 02:01:53.150
⁸And when he is come, he will reprove
the world of sin,

02:01:53.351 --> 02:01:55.861
and of righteousness and of judgment.

02:01:56.062 --> 02:01:59.539
⁹Of sin, because they believe not on me;
¹⁰Of righteousness…

02:01:59.740 --> 02:02:03.769
Shri Mataji: I think you stand up, and say,
you see, because people can’t hear you.

02:02:03.970 --> 02:02:06.875
See now how clearly, again, just read it.

02:02:07.076 --> 02:02:09.291
How clear it is. What a nice chapter today.

02:02:09.492 --> 02:02:14.223
Yogi: ⁷Nevertheless I tell you the truth;
It is expedient for you that I go away:

02:02:14.424 --> 02:02:17.841
for if I go not away, the Comforter will
not come unto you;

02:02:18.042 --> 02:02:21.420
but if I depart, I will send Her unto you.

02:02:21.621 --> 02:02:24.710
⁸And when She is come, She will reprove
the world of sin,

02:02:24.911 --> 02:02:27.869
and of righteousness and of judgment:

02:02:28.070 --> 02:02:30.422
⁹Of sin, because they believe not on me;

02:02:30.623 --> 02:02:34.862
¹⁰Of righteousness, because I go to my
Father, and ye see me no more;

02:02:35.063 --> 02:02:38.946
¹¹Of judgment, because the prince of this
world is judged.

02:02:39.147 --> 02:02:43.523
¹²I have yet many things to say unto you,
but ye cannot hear (bear) them now.

02:02:43.724 --> 02:02:46.194
Howbeit when She, the Spirit of truth,
is come,

02:02:46.395 --> 02:02:51.754
She will guide you into all truth: for She
shall not speak (of) himself;

02:02:51.955 --> 02:02:56.981
but whatsoever She shall hear, that shall
She speak:

02:02:57.182 --> 02:03:01.740
and She will shew you things to come.
Shri Mataji: Whatsoever She saw.

02:03:01.948 --> 02:03:03.725
Yogi (repeats): … and SHE will shew you
things to come.

02:03:03.926 --> 02:03:08.469
Shri Mataji: No, before this sentence,
what is it?

02:03:09.986 --> 02:03:13.124
Yogi (repeats): ¹³Howbeit when Her,
the Spirit of truth, is come,

02:03:13.359 --> 02:03:17.961
She will guide you into all truth: for She
shall not speak of Herself;

02:03:18.162 --> 02:03:25.808
but whatsoever She shall hear, that
shall She speak:

02:03:26.009 --> 02:03:28.513
and She will shew you things to come.

02:03:28.714 --> 02:03:31.867
¹⁴She shall glorify me: for She shall
receive of mine,

02:03:32.068 --> 02:03:34.347
and shall shew it unto you.

02:03:34.548 --> 02:03:38.410
¹⁵All things that the Father hath are mine:
therefore said I,

02:03:38.611 --> 02:03:42.805
that She shall take of mine, and shall
shew it unto you.

02:03:43.006 --> 02:03:46.198
¹⁶A little while, and ye shall not see me:
and again, a little while,

02:03:46.399 --> 02:03:50.064
and ye shall see me, because I go
to the Father.

02:03:54.039 --> 02:03:58.644
Shri Mataji: Now better? Yes, better.

02:04:03.135 --> 02:04:07.422
Better now? Just see on his head. Are
you alright?

02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:12.420
He is alright. Alright. Now.

02:04:13.261 --> 02:04:16.246
May God bless you.

02:04:18.144 --> 02:04:23.986
Other yogi: ¹⁷Then said some of his
disciples among themselves,

02:04:24.187 --> 02:04:27.577
What is this that he saith unto thee,

02:04:27.777 --> 02:04:31.372
What is this that he saith unto us,

02:04:31.573 --> 02:04:36.131
A little while, and ye shall not see me:

02:04:36.332 --> 02:04:42.662
and again, a little while, and ye shall
see me:

02:04:42.863 --> 02:04:47.170
(and), Because I go unto the Father?

02:04:47.371 --> 02:04:54.042
¹⁸They said therefore, What is this that
he saith, A little while?

02:04:54.243 --> 02:04:58.355
He cannot tell what he saith.

02:04:58.556 --> 02:05:06.594
¹⁹Now Jesus knew that they were desirous
to ask him, and said unto them,

02:05:06.797 --> 02:05:11.657
Do ye inquire among yourselves of that
I said,

02:05:11.858 --> 02:05:15.488
A little while, and ye shall not see me:

02:05:15.689 --> 02:05:22.357
and again, a little while, and ye shall
see me?

02:05:22.616 --> 02:05:30.117
²⁰Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye
shall weep and lament,

02:05:30.318 --> 02:05:36.279
but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall
be sorrowful,

02:05:36.574 --> 02:05:42.554
but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.

02:05:42.755 --> 02:05:47.370
²¹A woman when she is in travail hath
sorrow,

02:05:47.571 --> 02:05:50.596
because her hour is come:

02:05:50.797 --> 02:05:55.235
but as soon as she is delivered
of the child,

02:05:55.436 --> 02:06:00.105
she remembereth no more the anguish,

02:06:00.306 --> 02:06:06.105
for joy that a man is born unto the world.

02:06:06.306 --> 02:06:13.069
²²And ye now therefore - and ye now
therefore have sorrow:

02:06:13.270 --> 02:06:20.830
but I will see, but I will see you again,
and your heart shall rejoice,

02:06:21.046 --> 02:06:25.194
and your joy no man taketh from you.

02:06:25.395 --> 02:06:29.931
²³And in that day ye shall ask me nothing.

02:06:30.132 --> 02:06:35.532
Shri Mataji: In that day, you see? You
shall ask me nothing.

02:06:39.453 --> 02:06:44.074
Yogi: Verily, verily, I say unto you,
Whatsoever ye shall ask

02:06:44.275 --> 02:06:49.731
the Father in my name, he shall give
it you.

02:06:49.932 --> 02:06:53.678
²⁴Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my
name:

02:06:53.879 --> 02:07:01.173
ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy
may be full.

02:07:01.374 --> 02:07:05.039
²⁵These things have I spoken unto you
in proverbs:

02:07:05.240 --> 02:07:11.112
but the time cometh, when I shall no more
speak unto you in proverbs,

02:07:11.313 --> 02:07:16.225
but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.

02:07:16.426 --> 02:07:19.849
²⁶At that time of day ye shall ask in my
name:

02:07:20.050 --> 02:07:27.370
and I say not unto you, that I will pray
the Father for you:

02:07:27.571 --> 02:07:32.806
²⁷For the Father himself loveth you,
because ye have loved me,

02:07:33.007 --> 02:07:37.780
and have believed that I came from God.

02:07:37.981 --> 02:07:43.810
Shri Mataji: Beautiful. Now what more
you want? Said everything!

02:07:47.700 --> 02:07:52.652
Read the Resurrection part, somewhere.

02:07:55.287 --> 02:08:01.064
All right. First here make…

02:08:02.104 --> 02:08:07.846
this side. Did you tell?

02:08:08.820 --> 02:08:11.408
Good. Here.

02:08:30.494 --> 02:08:33.884
Now put your hands towards me.

02:08:39.504 --> 02:08:44.251
All right? Good.

02:08:46.979 --> 02:08:56.150
Now. Can we – I was thinking – all right,

02:08:56.426 --> 02:09:00.678
for Mandy and Magda,

02:09:01.465 --> 02:09:05.317
you can come and wash my hands.

02:09:17.537 --> 02:09:20.843
Ken, one of the things.

02:09:25.963 --> 02:09:29.509
If you can bring a bucket or something
you can put on that…

02:09:29.725 --> 02:09:34.099
Yogi: [John, 19.41] ⁴¹Now in the place
where he was crucified there was a garden;

02:09:34.334 --> 02:09:40.327
and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein
was never man yet laid.

02:09:40.528 --> 02:09:45.476
⁴²There laid they Jesus therefore because
of the Jews’ preparation day;

02:09:45.751 --> 02:09:49.983
or the sepulchre was nigh at hand.

02:09:50.184 --> 02:09:54.368
¹The first day of the week cometh Mary
Magdalene early,

02:09:54.569 --> 02:09:57.412
when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre,

02:09:57.613 --> 02:10:01.131
seeth the stone taken away from
the sepulchre.

02:10:01.332 --> 02:10:05.157
[Shri Mataji: “Get a bucket or something”.]
Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter,

02:10:05.358 --> 02:10:10.099
and to the other disciple, whom Jesus
loved, and saith unto them,

02:10:10.300 --> 02:10:13.055
They have taken away the Lord out
of the sepulchre,

02:10:13.256 --> 02:10:16.193
and we do not know where they have laid
him. [Shri Mataji: “Some bucket”.]

02:10:16.394 --> 02:10:21.747
³Peter therefore went forth, and that other
disciple, and came to the sepulchre.

02:10:21.948 --> 02:10:26.450
⁴So they ran both together: and the other
disciple did outrun Peter,

02:10:26.651 --> 02:10:29.303
and came first to the sepulchre.

02:10:29.504 --> 02:10:35.046
⁵And he stooping down, and looking in,
saw the linen clothes lying;

02:10:35.247 --> 02:10:37.135
yet went he not in.

02:10:37.336 --> 02:10:40.021
⁶Then cometh Simon Peter following him,

02:10:40.222 --> 02:10:44.811
and went into the sepulchre, and seeth
the linen clothes lie,

02:10:45.012 --> 02:10:49.642
⁷And the napkin, that was about his head,
not lying with the linen clothes,

02:10:49.843 --> 02:10:53.273
but wrapped together in a place by itself.

02:10:53.474 --> 02:10:55.632
⁸Then went in also that other disciple,

02:10:55.833 --> 02:11:00.039
which came first to the sepulchre, and he
saw, and believed.

02:11:00.242 --> 02:11:05.571
⁹For as yet they knew not the scripture,
that he must rise again from the dead.

02:11:05.772 --> 02:11:11.346
¹⁰Then the disciples went away again
unto their own home.

02:11:11.547 --> 02:11:14.985
¹¹But Mary stood without at the sepulchre
weeping:

02:11:15.186 --> 02:11:19.487
and as she wept, she stooped down, and
looked into the sepulchre,

02:11:19.688 --> 02:11:22.592
¹²And seeth two angels in white sitting,

02:11:22.793 --> 02:11:25.347
the one at the head, and the other
at the feet,

02:11:25.548 --> 02:11:28.287
where the body of Jesus had lain.

02:11:28.488 --> 02:11:33.093
¹³And they say unto her, Woman, why
weepest thou?

02:11:33.294 --> 02:11:37.367
She saith unto them, Because they have
taken away my Lord,

02:11:37.568 --> 02:11:40.672
and I know not where they have laid him.

02:11:40.873 --> 02:11:44.501
¹⁴And when she had thus said, she
turned herself back,

02:11:44.702 --> 02:11:50.277
and saw Jesus standing, and knew not
that it was Jesus.

02:11:50.478 --> 02:11:53.914
¹⁵Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why
weepest thou?

02:11:54.125 --> 02:11:56.554
Whom seekest thou?

02:11:56.755 --> 02:12:00.517
She, supposing him to be the gardener,
saith unto him,

02:12:00.721 --> 02:12:06.232
Sir, if thou have borne him hence, take
(tell) me where thou hast laid him,

02:12:06.432 --> 02:12:09.300
and I will take him away.

02:12:09.501 --> 02:12:12.766
¹⁶Jesus saith unto her, Mary.

02:12:12.967 --> 02:12:20.822
She turned herself, and saith unto him,
Rabboni; which is to say, Master.

02:12:21.023 --> 02:12:24.162
Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not;

02:12:24.363 --> 02:12:27.516
for I am not yet ascended to my Father:

02:12:27.717 --> 02:12:30.807
but go to my brethren, and say unto them,

02:12:31.008 --> 02:12:34.376
I ascend unto my Father, and your Father;

02:12:34.577 --> 02:12:39.056
and to my God, and your God.

02:12:48.357 --> 02:12:52.246
Shri Mataji: Left is catching. Just rub
this left foot.

02:12:52.446 --> 02:12:56.625
Rub it. Just rub the left. All right.

02:12:56.865 --> 02:13:04.585
See, these two, two fingers up here, see,
Vishuddhi and Agnya. Rub it hard.

02:13:13.797 --> 02:13:18.564
Other yogi: ¹⁸Mary Magdalene came and told
the disciples that she had seen the Lord,

02:13:18.765 --> 02:13:22.912
and that he had spoken these things
unto her.

02:13:23.113 --> 02:13:27.255
¹⁹Then the same day at evening, being
the first day of the week,

02:13:27.456 --> 02:13:30.449
when the doors were shut where
the disciples were assembled

02:13:30.650 --> 02:13:34.761
for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood
in the midst,

02:13:34.962 --> 02:13:39.155
and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.

02:13:39.356 --> 02:13:46.016
²⁰And when he had so said, he shewed
unto them his hands and his side.

02:13:46.217 --> 02:13:50.886
Then were the disciples glad, when they
saw the Lord.

02:13:51.087 --> 02:13:54.899
²¹Then said Jesus to them again,
Peace be unto you:

02:13:55.100 --> 02:14:00.182
as my Father hath sent me, even so
send I you.

02:14:00.383 --> 02:14:04.210
²²And when he had said this, he breathed
on them,

02:14:04.411 --> 02:14:09.780
and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy
Ghost:

02:14:09.981 --> 02:14:15.475
²³Whose soever sins ye remit, they are
remitted unto them;

02:14:15.676 --> 02:14:20.941
and whose soever sins ye retain, they
are retained.

02:14:21.142 --> 02:14:25.629
²⁴But Thomas, one of the twelve, called
Didymus,

02:14:25.830 --> 02:14:29.189
was not with them when Jesus came.

02:14:29.390 --> 02:14:34.147
²⁵The other disciples therefore said unto
him, We have seen the Lord.

02:14:34.348 --> 02:14:40.280
But he said unto them, Except I shall see
in his hands the print of the nails,

02:14:40.481 --> 02:14:43.031
and put my finger into the print
of the nails,

02:14:43.232 --> 02:14:47.861
and thrust my hand into his side, I will
not believe.

02:14:48.062 --> 02:14:52.222
²⁶And after eight days again his disciples
were within,

02:14:52.423 --> 02:14:58.203
and Thomas with them: then came Jesus,
the doors being shut,

02:14:58.404 --> 02:15:02.572
and stood in the midst, and said, Peace
be unto you.

02:15:02.773 --> 02:15:09.132
²⁷Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither
thy finger, and behold my hands;

02:15:09.333 --> 02:15:13.935
and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it
into my side:

02:15:14.136 --> 02:15:17.327
and be not faithless, but believing.

02:15:17.528 --> 02:15:23.431
²⁸And Thomas answered and said unto him,
My Lord and my God.

02:15:23.632 --> 02:15:30.494
²⁹Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because
thou hast seen me, thou hast believed:

02:15:30.695 --> 02:15:35.298
blessed are they that have not seen,
and yet have believed.

02:15:35.499 --> 02:15:39.978
³⁰And many other signs truly did Jesus
in the presence of his disciples,

02:15:40.179 --> 02:15:43.993
which are not written in this book:
³¹But these are written,

02:15:44.194 --> 02:15:48.730
that ye might believe that Jesus is
the Christ, the Son of God;

02:15:48.931 --> 02:15:53.387
and that believing ye might have life
through his name.

02:15:53.587 --> 02:15:57.685
Shri Mataji: He tried to awaken their
Kundalini.

02:15:59.663 --> 02:16:03.902
It’s not written in this book; I wish they
had written.

02:16:04.103 --> 02:16:07.152
Many Christians would have been saved.

02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:11.946
All right. So better? Wash my hands.

02:16:13.636 --> 02:16:21.737
Yes, two for one hand. Wash it. Hard.
Hold the another one.

02:16:24.894 --> 02:16:28.854
Yogini: After these things Jesus shewed
himself again to the disciples at the sea …

02:16:29.055 --> 02:16:33.508
Shri Mataji: Stand up and read loudly,
I can’t hear you.

02:16:35.350 --> 02:16:37.898
Yogini: ¹After these things Jesus shewed
himself again

02:16:38.098 --> 02:16:41.160
to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias;

02:16:41.376 --> 02:16:44.349
and on this wise shewed he himself.

02:16:44.614 --> 02:16:48.831
²There were together Simon Peter, and
Thomas called Didymus,

02:16:49.032 --> 02:16:52.346
and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee,

02:16:52.547 --> 02:16:57.086
and the sons of Zebedee, and two other
of his disciples.

02:16:57.286 --> 02:17:00.732
³Simon Peter saith unto them, I g
a fishing.

02:17:00.962 --> 02:17:03.972
They say unto him, We also go with thee.

02:17:04.173 --> 02:17:07.852
They went forth, and entered into a ship
immediately;

02:17:08.053 --> 02:17:11.038
and that night they caught nothing.

02:17:11.239 --> 02:17:14.789
⁴But when the morning was now come,
Jesus stood on the shore:

02:17:14.990 --> 02:17:18.776
but the disciples knew not that it was
Jesus.

02:17:18.977 --> 02:17:23.114
⁵Then Jesus saith unto them, Children,
have ye any meat?

02:17:23.315 --> 02:17:26.999
They answered him, No. ⁶And he said
unto them,

02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:32.557
Cast the net on the right side of the ship,
and ye shall find. They cast therefore,

02:17:32.758 --> 02:17:36.928
and now they were not able to draw it
for the multitude of fishes.

02:17:37.129 --> 02:17:40.997
⁷Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved
saith unto Peter,

02:17:41.198 --> 02:17:46.096
It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard
that it was the Lord,

02:17:46.297 --> 02:17:49.768
he girt his fisher’s coat unto him,
(for he was naked,)

02:17:49.969 --> 02:17:53.081
and did cast himself into the sea.

02:17:53.282 --> 02:17:57.006
⁸And the other disciples came in a little
ship;

02:17:57.207 --> 02:18:01.037
(for they were not far from land, but as it
were two hundred cubits,)

02:18:01.238 --> 02:18:04.052
dragging the net with fishes.

02:18:04.253 --> 02:18:09.400
⁹As soon then as they were come to
the land, they saw a fire of coals there,

02:18:09.601 --> 02:18:14.159
and fish laid thereon, and bread. ¹⁰Jesus
saith unto them,

02:18:14.494 --> 02:18:17.433
Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.

02:18:17.634 --> 02:18:20.909
¹¹Simon Peter went up, and drew the net
to land

02:18:21.110 --> 02:18:24.599
full of great fishes, an hundred and
fifty-three:

02:18:24.800 --> 02:18:30.289
and for all there were so many, yet was
not the net broken.

02:18:30.490 --> 02:18:33.456
¹²Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine.

02:18:33.657 --> 02:18:37.023
And none of the disciples durst ask him,
Who art thou?

02:18:37.224 --> 02:18:39.614
knowing that it was the Lord.

02:18:39.815 --> 02:18:45.144
¹³Jesus then cometh, and taketh the bread,
and giveth them, and fish likewise.

02:18:45.345 --> 02:18:49.322
¹⁴This is now the third time that Jesus
shewed himself to his disciples,

02:18:49.523 --> 02:18:53.097
after that he was risen from the dead.

02:18:53.298 --> 02:18:57.292
¹⁵So when they had dined, Jesus saith
to Simon Peter,

02:18:57.493 --> 02:19:01.309
Simon, son of Jonas… Simon, son of Jonas

02:19:01.510 --> 02:19:05.015
lovest thou me more than these? He saith
unto him, Yea, Lord;…

02:19:05.216 --> 02:19:08.764
Shri Mataji: See the vibrations, are better
now. Yogini: …thou knowest that I love thee.

02:19:08.965 --> 02:19:13.362
He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.
Shri Mataji: We’ll give something else…

02:19:13.578 --> 02:19:19.328
¹⁶He saith to him again the second time,
Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?

02:19:19.529 --> 02:19:23.735
He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest
that I love thee.

02:19:23.936 --> 02:19:27.246
He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.

02:19:27.447 --> 02:19:32.713
¹⁷He saith unto him the third time, Simon,
son of Jonas, lovest thou me?

02:19:32.932 --> 02:19:37.537
Peter was grieved because he said unto him
the third time, Lovest thou me?

02:19:37.738 --> 02:19:40.949
And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest
all these things;

02:19:41.149 --> 02:19:48.218
thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith
unto him, Feed my sheep.

02:19:48.419 --> 02:19:53.086
¹⁸Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When
thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself,

02:19:53.287 --> 02:19:57.601
and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but
when thou shalt be old,

02:19:57.801 --> 02:20:01.502
thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and
another shall gird thee,

02:20:01.702 --> 02:20:04.621
and carry thee whither thou wouldest
not go.

02:20:04.822 --> 02:20:09.991
¹⁹This spake he, signifying by what death
he should glorify God.

02:20:10.192 --> 02:20:15.004
And when he had spoken this, he saith
unto him, Follow me.

02:20:15.228 --> 02:20:20.374
²⁰Then Peter, turning about, seeth
the disciple whom Jesus loved following;

02:20:20.575 --> 02:20:24.396
which also leaned on his breast at supper,
and said,

02:20:24.597 --> 02:20:28.202
Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?

02:20:28.403 --> 02:20:33.540
²¹Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord,
and what shall this man do?

02:20:33.741 --> 02:20:39.196
²²Jesus saith unto him, If I will
[Shri Mataji: “Honey”…]

02:20:39.397 --> 02:20:41.817
that he tarry till I come, what is that
to thee?

02:20:42.018 --> 02:20:44.832
[Shri Mataji: Honey, honey… honey.]
Yogini: Follow thou me.

02:20:45.033 --> 02:20:47.735
²³Then went this saying abroad among
the brethren,

02:20:47.936 --> 02:20:51.290
that that disciple should not die:

02:20:51.491 --> 02:20:55.667
yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall
not die;

02:20:55.868 --> 02:21:00.884
If I will that he tarry till I come, what
is that to thee?

02:21:01.119 --> 02:21:06.124
²⁴This is the disciple which testifieth
of these things, and wrote these things:

02:21:06.325 --> 02:21:09.850
and we know that his testimony is true.

02:21:10.051 --> 02:21:12.677
²⁵And there are also many other things
which Jesus did,

02:21:12.878 --> 02:21:18.434
the which, if they should be written every
one, I suppose that even the world itself

02:21:18.635 --> 02:21:21.934
could not contain the books that shall
(should) be written.

02:21:22.159 --> 02:21:24.288
Shri Mataji: Ah, you see, He said that,
“Thou shalt not die.”

02:21:24.489 --> 02:21:29.055
What does that mean? Nobody dies, isn’t it?

02:21:29.256 --> 02:21:34.200
And that you’ll be revived, you’ll have
an Eternal Life!

02:22:23.092 --> 02:22:28.813
Good. Now …

02:22:29.014 --> 02:22:32.097
that should do.

02:22:45.049 --> 02:22:48.324
Just pour it.

02:22:50.848 --> 02:22:56.405
Yes. Is it over?

02:23:00.709 --> 02:23:06.378
You didn’t show - read the Resurrection
itself.

02:23:21.128 --> 02:23:24.873
... you should pour some honey also,
pour something.

02:23:25.074 --> 02:23:29.253
Better. Honey is there.

02:23:31.503 --> 02:23:34.392
Pour all that.

02:23:41.204 --> 02:23:44.789
It’s good. That will do.

02:23:44.990 --> 02:23:49.939
Now. More milk.

02:23:51.430 --> 02:23:54.772
More milk.

02:23:56.513 --> 02:23:59.532
Gavin? [Gavin: “Yes, Mother”]

02:24:12.468 --> 02:24:15.659
More milk.

02:24:41.593 --> 02:24:44.563
Good.

02:25:05.657 --> 02:25:07.646
Gavin: [John 20: 19-23] 36And as they thus
spake, Jesus himself

02:25:07.847 --> 02:25:13.302
stood in the midst of them, and saith unto
them, Peace be unto you.

02:25:13.503 --> 02:25:18.266
³⁷But they were terrified and affrighted,
and supposed that they had seen a spirit.

02:25:18.467 --> 02:25:21.034
³⁸And he said unto them, Why are ye
troubled?

02:25:21.235 --> 02:25:24.704
and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?

02:25:24.905 --> 02:25:29.805
³⁹Behold my hands and my feet, that it is
I myself:

02:25:30.006 --> 02:25:35.387
handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not
flesh and bones, as ye see me have.

02:25:35.588 --> 02:25:38.367
Shri Mataji: That’s it!

02:25:38.568 --> 02:25:43.570
Gavin: ⁴⁰And when he had thus spoken,
he shewed them his hands and his feet.

02:25:43.771 --> 02:25:47.038
⁴¹And while they yet believed not for joy,
and wondered,

02:25:47.238 --> 02:25:52.082
he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?

02:25:52.282 --> 02:25:56.759
⁴²And they gave him a piece of a broiled
fish, and of an honeycomb.

02:25:56.960 --> 02:26:01.556
⁴³And he took it, and did eat before them.

02:26:02.044 --> 02:26:06.968
⁴⁴And he said unto them, These are
the words which I spake unto you,

02:26:07.169 --> 02:26:10.946
while I was yet with you, that all things
must be fulfilled,

02:26:11.146 --> 02:26:14.385
which were written in the law of Moses,
and in the prophets,

02:26:14.585 --> 02:26:18.934
and in the psalms, concerning me.

02:26:19.351 --> 02:26:26.055
⁴⁵Then opened he their understanding,
that they might understand the scriptures,

02:26:26.255 --> 02:26:29.059
⁴⁶And said unto them, Thus it is written,

02:26:29.260 --> 02:26:31.884
and thus it behoved Christ to suffer,

02:26:32.085 --> 02:26:36.730
and to rise from the dead the third day:

02:26:36.933 --> 02:26:40.515
⁴⁷And that repentance and remission
of sins should be preached

02:26:40.715 --> 02:26:46.885
in his name among all nations, beginning
at Jerusalem.

02:26:47.086 --> 02:26:51.246
⁴⁸And ye are witnesses of these things.

02:26:51.447 --> 02:26:54.713
⁴⁹And, behold, I send the promise of my
Father upon you…

02:26:54.914 --> 02:27:00.509
Shri Mataji: Behold? Gavin: ... I send
the promise of my Father upon you:

02:27:00.710 --> 02:27:03.507
but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem,

02:27:03.708 --> 02:27:06.893
until ye be endued with power from on high.

02:27:07.093 --> 02:27:12.033
Shri Mataji: Just read this one:
“I’ll tarry you…”.

02:27:12.234 --> 02:27:15.954
Gavin: I’ll tarry you in the city of Jerusalem,
Shri Mataji: I’ll have some more water.

02:27:16.155 --> 02:27:19.749
Gavin: until ye be endued with power
from on high.

02:27:19.950 --> 02:27:25.098
Shri Mataji: Again, please. I didn’t follow
every word.

02:27:25.299 --> 02:27:28.632
“I will tarry you…”. Yes.

02:27:28.833 --> 02:27:32.121
Gavin [repeats:] Behold, I send the promise
of my Father upon you:

02:27:32.340 --> 02:27:35.729
but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem,

02:27:35.930 --> 02:27:40.515
until ye be endued with power from on high.

02:27:40.716 --> 02:27:43.351
Shri Mataji: See?

02:27:47.526 --> 02:27:50.203
Gavin: And he led them out as far
as to Bethany,

02:27:50.404 --> 02:27:54.966
and he lifted up his hands, and blessed
them.

02:27:55.167 --> 02:27:58.962
⁵¹And it came to pass, while he blessed
them, he was parted from them,

02:27:59.163 --> 02:28:02.075
and carried up into heaven.

02:28:02.276 --> 02:28:07.224
⁵²And they worshipped him, and returned
to Jerusalem with great joy:

02:28:07.425 --> 02:28:13.144
⁵³And were continually in the temple,
praising and blessing God.

02:28:14.747 --> 02:28:21.706
Shri Mataji: It’s promised! I’ve said it
many-a-times, you are promised!

02:28:23.858 --> 02:28:26.844
Very good.

02:29:14.589 --> 02:29:19.042
How I think should we do -

02:29:19.243 --> 02:29:24.590
we’ll have food and then have havan?
What is it?

02:29:27.194 --> 02:29:29.848
Is food ready or…

02:29:30.049 --> 02:29:33.598
We can have havan and then have the food,
whichever way you see.

02:29:33.799 --> 02:29:38.512
I’m free tonight, for the whole night.

02:29:42.077 --> 02:29:45.885
Whatever you say. Why this?

02:29:46.086 --> 02:29:51.048
Gavin: Mother, for this puja we don’t give
You a sari.

02:29:51.249 --> 02:29:55.197
Shri Mataji: Oh, good.
Gavin: We give You something more symbolic.

02:29:55.398 --> 02:30:00.140
Shri Mataji: That’s good. May God
bless you.

02:30:12.907 --> 02:30:18.898
Beautiful. Can I open?

02:30:32.351 --> 02:30:34.954
Beautiful.

02:31:16.293 --> 02:31:19.357
[Somebody: “Can you help?”

02:31:24.087 --> 02:31:28.961
A yogini: “Comes off, Mother…”].
Gavin: What a granthi!

02:31:40.375 --> 02:31:43.853
Shri Mataji: Really beautiful, Gavin.

02:31:44.068 --> 02:31:47.292
Really beautiful.

02:31:48.819 --> 02:31:53.877
What’s in there? Gavin?

02:31:54.175 --> 02:31:59.597
That’s not good, that’s too much.

02:32:09.308 --> 02:32:13.065
I don’t know how you could think of all
these things, this is too much.

02:32:13.266 --> 02:32:17.355
Yogini: Mother? Mother? It’s a real egg.
Shri Mataji: It’s a real egg.

02:32:17.556 --> 02:32:20.905
Yogini: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: I know, I could feel the -

02:32:21.106 --> 02:32:26.240
could feel it. Must be duck’s egg.
Or something.

02:32:26.441 --> 02:32:29.127
Or something. It’s very big, eh?
Some yogis: Goose.

02:32:29.327 --> 02:32:31.611
Yogini: It’s a goose egg.
Shri Mataji: Hm?

02:32:31.812 --> 02:32:34.961
Yogini: Goose egg.
Shri Mataji: Goose egg.

02:32:36.473 --> 02:32:39.362
Very well done.

02:32:41.654 --> 02:32:44.290
Good. All right. And this one is? [A ring]

02:32:44.491 --> 02:32:47.598
It’s too much, Gavin, it’s too much.

02:32:47.799 --> 02:32:50.716
Very beautiful.

02:32:52.562 --> 02:32:55.303
Thank you.

02:32:55.504 --> 02:32:58.368
Gavin and yogis: Jai Mataji.

02:33:00.363 --> 02:33:03.054
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much,
thank you.

02:33:03.255 --> 02:33:05.661
It’s so beautiful, you can’t imagine.
Very beautiful.

02:33:05.868 --> 02:33:11.857
It has that pradakshina round the Spirit.

02:33:12.058 --> 02:33:16.068
See? It’s beautiful. What a choice,
it's a beauty.

02:33:16.269 --> 02:33:20.021
We shouldn’t spend money on gold.

02:33:22.711 --> 02:33:25.241
It’s beautiful.

02:33:29.622 --> 02:33:34.265
It’s too much, you shouldn’t give
so expensive things to me.

02:33:34.466 --> 02:33:37.752
Where did you get this egg?

02:33:39.198 --> 02:33:42.004
Real beauty I think.

02:33:43.036 --> 02:33:46.135
It’s quite an antique.

02:33:47.199 --> 02:33:51.360
Could you do it carefully, again,
tie it up.

02:33:55.868 --> 02:33:58.360
What an idea.

02:33:59.234 --> 02:34:03.698
I wish the egg that walks becomes
like this,

02:34:03.899 --> 02:34:09.062
all adorned, with all the beauty.

02:34:09.286 --> 02:34:12.169
All the precious things.

02:34:13.615 --> 02:34:18.288
Yes? You brought this for me?

02:34:19.207 --> 02:34:22.847
Hello, what’s that? This is what? This is
what you’ve got?

02:34:23.047 --> 02:34:30.326
Eh? What’s this for? Now what is there?
This.

02:34:30.732 --> 02:34:36.221
Hm?  It’s flower? This is - flower?

02:34:41.818 --> 02:34:46.527
What happened? You’ve been crying!

02:34:49.907 --> 02:34:52.597
Don’t cry.

02:34:54.045 --> 02:34:58.911
Did you see this one is? What’s that?

02:34:59.240 --> 02:35:03.593
She is becoming a farmer or what?

02:35:05.278 --> 02:35:07.940
See this flower.

02:35:09.861 --> 02:35:12.250
Good?

02:35:27.189 --> 02:35:29.682
Nice.

02:35:36.885 --> 02:35:39.861
So what about chana?

02:35:44.151 --> 02:35:46.628
Now what’s that?

02:35:47.210 --> 02:35:50.338
She is getting taller!

02:35:51.795 --> 02:35:56.142
So now, what is the programme, next?
Is - what about dinner?

02:35:56.343 --> 02:36:03.134
Or should we have the puja first? Who is
the in-charge?

02:36:06.089 --> 02:36:11.094
I was saying that Nick should be in charge
of this place

02:36:11.297 --> 02:36:14.307
and Norman should assist him,

02:36:14.508 --> 02:36:18.224
and they should form all the rules and
regulations of this place.

02:36:18.425 --> 02:36:22.832
And when Harry comes, his wife will look
after the cooking side of it,

02:36:23.033 --> 02:36:26.295
and the cleanliness of the place, because
she’ll stay at home,

02:36:26.496 --> 02:36:30.467
and Harry will look after the Puja part.

02:36:34.031 --> 02:36:36.260
I think to the other ashram also, whatever
is needed

02:36:36.461 --> 02:36:42.307
you must do the needful, make it
a comfortable place.

02:36:58.909 --> 02:37:06.505
And, any other problems with this place?
You have got sufficient

02:37:06.706 --> 02:37:15.813
rugs and carpets to spread here? Nick?

02:37:16.014 --> 02:37:18.893
Nick: We have about fourteen, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Hm?

02:37:19.094 --> 02:37:22.516
Nick: We have about fourteen carpets…
Shri Mataji: Forty carpets.

02:37:22.716 --> 02:37:25.756
Nick: Fourteen, that You bought for us.
Yogini: Fourteen.

02:37:25.957 --> 02:37:28.497
Shri Mataji: Forty. Yogini: Fourteen.
Shri Mataji: Fourteen. Yogini: Yes.

02:37:28.706 --> 02:37:31.443
Yogi: It’s all the carpets You bought
for us… (inaudible), Mother.

02:37:31.644 --> 02:37:39.534
Shri Mataji: Yes. That’s true, but what
about for people in the bedrooms,

02:37:39.735 --> 02:37:43.324
are they all right for them or they need
something more?

02:37:43.525 --> 02:37:48.790
Yogi: I think there are a few, Mother, that
still need some flooring. Shri Mataji: Hm?

02:37:48.991 --> 02:37:52.169
Yogi: There are some rooms that still need
carpets, Mother.

02:37:52.370 --> 02:37:54.987
Shri Mataji: They have parquet.

02:37:55.188 --> 02:38:01.197
But maybe you might need some - these
carpets you brought, the other ones,

02:38:01.398 --> 02:38:04.417
door-to-door ones, have you spread them
somewhere?

02:38:04.618 --> 02:38:07.453
Yogi: Some of them, Mother. Most of them
come in this area, here.

02:38:07.654 --> 02:38:13.286
Shri Mataji: Area, hm. Yes.

02:38:14.537 --> 02:38:19.560
Do you know, these are little small for
the bedrooms, I think.

02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:25.299
If there’s any need of anything you should
let us know,

02:38:25.500 --> 02:38:30.256
but you must keep some rooms vacant for
the guests who are coming here. All right?

02:38:30.457 --> 02:38:32.535
Yogi: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Some rooms must be kept.

02:38:32.736 --> 02:38:35.774
Norman, you would just go and see what
you would like to keep some of them,

02:38:35.975 --> 02:38:40.848
comfortable ones, for the guests who come
from anywhere else?

02:38:41.049 --> 02:38:47.290
And what about the food arrangements,
are all right?

02:38:47.490 --> 02:38:49.988
Yogi: No, I think this is being sorted out
now, Mother.

02:38:50.189 --> 02:38:53.165
Shri Mataji: Hm?
Yogi: We are sorting this out now, Mother…

02:38:53.366 --> 02:38:57.163
Shri Mataji: What about the gas, gas
connection?

02:38:57.364 --> 02:39:01.681
Yogi: Gas is on, Mother. Other yogi:
It’s on, Mother. Shri Mataji: It’s on.

02:39:02.603 --> 02:39:06.719
I mean, if you need, let me know.

02:39:06.920 --> 02:39:09.575
I don’t know what are your needs, it’s such
a huge thing

02:39:09.775 --> 02:39:15.273
that I can’t make out what you need and
what you want.

02:39:23.441 --> 02:39:26.578
Is done very well, I should say.

02:39:29.333 --> 02:39:33.244
Agnya is done very well and all these
things.

02:39:42.036 --> 02:39:48.390
Now what’s that? It’s a cake! All right.

02:39:48.591 --> 02:39:52.431
So, can you hold it for me? [Yogini:
“Yes, Mother”].

02:39:52.632 --> 02:39:56.969
Now, should I cut the cake first, and then
take the flowers, all right?

02:39:57.177 --> 02:40:03.060
Thank you. So this is to celebrate
the resurrection of Christ.

02:40:03.261 --> 02:40:07.872
And resurrection of all the sahaja yogis.
May God bless you all.

02:40:08.073 --> 02:40:15.807
Thank you. Just beautiful. May God
bless you.

02:40:17.533 --> 02:40:20.777
Hm. Good. Thank you.

02:40:20.978 --> 02:40:26.881
Hm. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

02:40:31.342 --> 02:40:34.311
Very good vibrations.

02:40:34.538 --> 02:40:38.736
Put your hands under my feet, let’s see,
under, like that.

02:40:38.937 --> 02:40:41.742
Now put your head down there, let’s see.

02:40:41.943 --> 02:40:45.825
Beautiful, good, great.

02:40:46.033 --> 02:40:49.282
Now let’s see her. Let her come also.

02:40:49.483 --> 02:40:53.700
Come along, put your foot, hands, too.

02:40:53.932 --> 02:40:58.091
So, you have to tell me your names again.
What’s your name?

02:40:58.339 --> 02:41:00.038
Girl: Lisa. Shri Mataji: Hm?
Girl: Lisa.

02:41:00.239 --> 02:41:04.817
Shri Mataji: Lisa. I know.

02:41:06.918 --> 02:41:13.478
Do you like this kind of dress, Lisa?
Next time for you also.

02:41:17.398 --> 02:41:24.281
New one for Bumble – good, she is all
right, I think she is all right -

02:41:34.502 --> 02:41:40.754
one for Athena, one for Olympia. They’ll
wear this kind of a dress. Eh?

02:41:40.955 --> 02:41:43.972
How will they look, very sweet. Let them
wear saris,

02:41:44.173 --> 02:41:48.837
I think, next time - that would be
the best.

02:41:49.038 --> 02:41:57.634
Imagine, Athena and Olympia wearing that.

02:41:58.324 --> 02:42:01.257
Now, it’s better.

02:42:03.478 --> 02:42:06.328
Thank you very much.

02:42:16.913 --> 02:42:19.500
May God bless you.

02:42:21.075 --> 02:42:23.567
What is it now, Gavin?

02:42:23.768 --> 02:42:26.622
Gavin: Mother, with Your permission,
Arneau has written a dedication.

02:42:26.823 --> 02:42:29.665
Shri Mataji: Who? Gavin: Arneau sent it.
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.

02:42:29.866 --> 02:42:32.717
Gavin: And then we’d like to sing Your
aarti, and then You could have Your supper.

02:42:32.918 --> 02:42:35.923
Shri Mataji: All right. What is?
Gavin: After this

02:42:36.124 --> 02:42:38.472
we’ll sing Your aarti, and then You may
have Your supper.

02:42:38.673 --> 02:42:44.018
Shri Mataji: All right. Please. All right,
come along.

02:42:44.219 --> 02:42:47.114
Gavin (reads): “Mother, for Your birthday,
we have made a pledge:

02:42:47.393 --> 02:42:50.807
we should dedicate our life to Sahaja Yoga.

02:42:51.015 --> 02:42:56.836
What is this pledge, and to what extent
can we follow this pledge?

02:42:57.037 --> 02:43:01.950
We have to be collectively surrended
to our Beloved Mother.

02:43:02.153 --> 02:43:08.538
We are collective the moment our Spirit
rejoins Your Heart, Mother.

02:43:08.739 --> 02:43:15.307
We are collective the moment Your Smile
irradiates our beings.

02:43:15.508 --> 02:43:19.972
We are collective the moment Your eyes
of love and compassion

02:43:20.173 --> 02:43:25.747
pour into our heart their Divine flow
of unequalled beauty.

02:43:25.948 --> 02:43:31.538
We are collective the moment Your heart
touches with softness and peace

02:43:31.740 --> 02:43:35.694
the inner part of our Selves;

02:43:35.895 --> 02:43:40.064
collective means one heart, in the Heart
of the Divine.

02:43:40.265 --> 02:43:44.673
One smile, in the Smile of God Almighty;

02:43:44.874 --> 02:43:52.002
one joy melted in the Divine Joy of Your
Glory, You, our Beloved Mother.

02:43:52.203 --> 02:43:57.631
One sound, expressed through the extremely
beautiful melody of Your Voice;

02:43:57.832 --> 02:44:01.827
then, we surrender to You.

02:44:02.028 --> 02:44:05.363
Surrender is a happening;

02:44:05.564 --> 02:44:12.615
it is the exchange of love between
the Mother and the child.

02:44:13.228 --> 02:44:16.483
Let us melt Your Heart,

02:44:16.684 --> 02:44:21.480
let us dissolve ourselves in the inner part
of Your Heart;

02:44:21.691 --> 02:44:26.169
so that we can see and feel the glory
of Your Becoming;

02:44:26.370 --> 02:44:33.035
the tenderness of Your Face and the grace
of Your Hands.

02:44:34.298 --> 02:44:41.311
But surrender is more: surrender is action
magnified through collectivity.

02:44:41.530 --> 02:44:45.254
How can we love You, Mother, if we do
not act?

02:44:45.455 --> 02:44:49.551
How can we follow You if we don’t find?

02:44:49.752 --> 02:44:52.276
How can we be the Golden Builders,

02:44:52.477 --> 02:44:57.862
if we do not build Your love and compassion
in our hearts?

02:44:58.063 --> 02:45:02.303
Let us pray to You, Mother, to be Your
soldiers,

02:45:02.504 --> 02:45:06.402
the soldiers of truth and of righteousness.

02:45:06.603 --> 02:45:09.211
Please, take out our passivity.

02:45:09.412 --> 02:45:14.605
Kill our inaction. Destroy our apathy.

02:45:14.806 --> 02:45:18.558
Brothers and sisters, let us wake up
to gain the battlefield:

02:45:18.759 --> 02:45:22.595
are we sahaja yogis or are we cowards?

02:45:22.803 --> 02:45:27.265
Do we realise that we are the children
of Adi Shakti?

02:45:27.466 --> 02:45:31.693
Do we see, every second of our life,
that She is Almighty,

02:45:31.894 --> 02:45:38.593
that everything which lives and pulsates
comes from Her, and goes to Her?

02:45:38.794 --> 02:45:46.225
That the whole universe is in Her command,
and bows at Her Lotus Feet?

02:45:46.434 --> 02:45:51.449
That all the angels are protecting us,
to win the war?

02:45:51.650 --> 02:45:55.129
We are not allowed to sit down, we have
to stand up,

02:45:55.330 --> 02:46:00.395
to take the sword, to hold it firm in our
hands:

02:46:00.596 --> 02:46:06.750
what is more glorious and beautiful than
to fight alongside our Beloved Mother?

02:46:06.951 --> 02:46:12.007
When in the middle of the battlefield
we feel all is against us,

02:46:12.208 --> 02:46:16.999
let us just pronounce Her Name in our
heart:

02:46:17.266 --> 02:46:20.022
Your Name, Mother, like a pure river,

02:46:20.223 --> 02:46:24.089
cleans and eliminates our fears and doubts,

02:46:24.314 --> 02:46:28.706
fills us with confidence and joy, courage
and faith,

02:46:28.907 --> 02:46:32.852
because Your Name is the Name of God
Almighty;

02:46:33.053 --> 02:46:38.168
let us collectively surrender to You,
extreme beauty,

02:46:38.369 --> 02:46:43.668
extraordinary glory, eternal purity,

02:46:43.869 --> 02:46:49.443
cosmic power, greatest love,

02:46:49.651 --> 02:46:55.185
unsurpassed splendour shining all over
the universe -

02:46:55.386 --> 02:46:59.840
Mother, Mother of all the Mothers,

02:47:00.041 --> 02:47:06.152
Mother of Your devoted children, this is
our pledge;

02:47:06.353 --> 02:47:13.786
and with Your grace and blessings,
therefore reside in our heart forever”.

02:47:17.739 --> 02:47:20.715
Shri Mataji: What beauty.

02:47:45.002 --> 02:47:50.902
Beautiful. More than any aarti.

02:47:54.805 --> 02:47:59.179
He realises, he realises the dimensions,

02:47:59.380 --> 02:48:04.547
all the dimensions of this great time
he realises, you see;

02:48:04.748 --> 02:48:08.419
you can see it very clearly.

02:48:13.295 --> 02:48:16.771
It will work out; as I told you the other
day, infrastructure, you see,

02:48:16.972 --> 02:48:19.503
has to work out, first of all, and
the Kundalini will work out,

02:48:19.704 --> 02:48:24.093
and then it will spark. Nothing to be
disappointed, it will work out.

02:48:24.294 --> 02:48:26.630
Kundalini will work out, but you have
to be very strong

02:48:26.831 --> 02:48:33.809
about certain things, of loving others.
Strong to love, is the point;

02:48:34.711 --> 02:48:41.501
of giving, of sacrificing, forbearing,
enjoying it.

02:48:45.604 --> 02:48:49.429
Mildness, sweetness, gentleness,
graciousness towards others;

02:48:49.637 --> 02:48:53.959
and towards yourself you have to be firm.

02:49:02.442 --> 02:49:05.885
May God bless you all. May God bless you.

02:49:06.086 --> 02:49:09.133
May God bless you all.

02:49:11.242 --> 02:49:16.131
Whatever is said in this prayer, be your
own;

02:49:16.332 --> 02:49:18.943
may it happen to you;

02:49:19.144 --> 02:49:25.309
may it give you the manifestation
of what is desired.

02:49:25.887 --> 02:49:28.598
May God bless you.

02:49:44.642 --> 02:49:53.253
I was thinking, David, you can along with
Don and Gavin and all such people, you see,

02:49:53.454 --> 02:49:59.366
those who can talk to Mr. Bishop [of]
Canterbury fellow,

02:49:59.567 --> 02:50:03.198
could go and see him, some of you, could
go and see him,

02:50:03.399 --> 02:50:07.773
and tell him that this is the what it is,
just for yourself;

02:50:07.974 --> 02:50:11.253
if She is the Comforter, if She is the One
who has come,

02:50:11.462 --> 02:50:17.231
will it not be amiss for you,

02:50:18.669 --> 02:50:23.862
why not you first see Her and judge Her?

02:50:24.063 --> 02:50:28.423
Yogi: Mother, Mother, the man on the radio
said that

02:50:28.624 --> 02:50:36.016

could be a hour-long programme.

02:50:36.217 --> 02:50:38.541
