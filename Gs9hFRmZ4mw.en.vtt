00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:06.780
Yeah, it's not necessary. [MARATHI]

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.020
[MARATHI]

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.760
- You can hear Me otherwise, can't you?
- Yes, Mother.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.260
I wanted to thank you all for coming to the airport.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.800
I know you would not stop coming whatever I may tell you

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.460
and everywhere is just the same

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:15.900
but when I left the people in Canberra, I was sad because after a year I'll meet them

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.340
but then to see you all here again, I felt alright.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:32.080
It always happens like that specially for children; They grow so much in one year

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.960
and still they remember Me very well.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.900
We have to be careful about them and look after them well.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.760
They're all very sweet and beautiful.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.920
I'm going to see this preschool year how it is working for small children.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.240
I know the atmosphere in Australia

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.980
is not very congenial for children's growth.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:23.240
Firstly is this drug business is too much - so to be very careful with your children. You must talk to them,

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.320
you must look after them, you must know what they are doing, where are they going - keep company with them,

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.120
make friends with them. You should find out what are their friends are like -

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.740
not to curb down their freedom or their sense of self-respect should not be challenged

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.740
but you can tell them that you are sahaja yogis and you're great.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:00.340
Also should warn them about these things because there's a big attack on the innocence, I think, from every angle.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.000
They're trying on these children and using them for something very dangerous.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.720
I was surprised that in Miami 12 year children were carrying pistols in their hands and killing people, you see.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.900
So we have to be now very careful. There are some negative forces just

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.360
starting a kind of a destruction of the innocence

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.340
and you have to be careful where they go, what are their interests are.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:44.160
Try to talk to them all the time. It is always a worry to Me about them

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:53.620
because you both are working sometimes. Then somebody else should look after the child. Don't leave the child alone.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.460
First thing is to look after the child for any mother and then the job.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.000
You can reduce lot of your expenses by that.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.620
Say, if you have to go to a job, you have to wear dresses everyday, you have to go a hairdresser -

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:22.000
all these thing [UNCLEAR] been reduced and enjoy looking after your children,

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:29.160
at least till they are grown up enough to understand what is good for them and what is bad for them.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.060
And you can never forgive yourself if your child get ruined because of neglect.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:43.880
It's nice now we are sahaja yogis and you understand what these children are. They are special children you have

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.340
and you understand their value.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:57.980
Also for all of you, I find such beautiful faces like

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:04.240
flowers. We have to understand that

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.140
you have got this Divine power now within you, it's flowing through you

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:20.720
but you have to give it to others. Unless and until the tree grows, it cannot go deeper

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:29.300
and then when you go deeper into yourself, you'll find that this Divinity is waiting

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.560
just to give you a greater understanding of yourself

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.960
and about the problems of the world.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:49.940
You understand that this transformation is so important and all of you have to work it out

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:59.740
in your own lives; It's not how many books you read about Divine,

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:07.600
it's not about how many lectures you listen to about sahaja yoga - it is what you practise.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.060
You have to practise righteousness, you have to practise kindness,

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.920
you have to practise sharing with others

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.960
and always introspect yourself - that's very important as the Russians are very introspective.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:31.080
You have to introspect to see, "Why am I doing this, what is the necessity to do this?"

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:39.880
And as you have the light within you, you can see it clearly, as there are many superficial things, superfluous thing

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:46.140
which we do. We hurt each other as a matter of habit sometimes.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.260
Try to find out, don't feel guilty, just face it.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.980
It's so nice to love someone

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:04.420
without any reward, without any expectations - just to love in the pure way.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:10.780
As it is I am so happy to see that such pure relations exists among all of you.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.920
Absolutely, I have not seen anyone, sort of, carrying on with somebody's wife or somebody's sister or something

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:26.620
and that you have such nice married life and such beautiful children to look after.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.620
So family is a very great thing for sahaja yog.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:38.660
The family unit has to be absolutely pure, simple

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:44.280
and understanding. Also the balance that we have now

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:52.240
we know how far to go with things so we need not go on buying things, so many things that

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:57.840
all the plastic fills the house. Try to keep to more artistic things,

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:04.640
develop your artistic talents - we have lot of scope in sahaja yoga.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:10.460
This is for everyday, day to day mundane life, is very important

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:19.180
that we should try to be competitive with others

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:27.520
in righteous, in goodness, in being kind to others - not jealous

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:34.740
about somethings that are so frivolous and which anybody can buy.

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:39.060
As you know we are different people, very different.

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:47.020
In the evolutionary process you have achieved this, you must be some great people in your last lives.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:54.600
I think that you are seeking; There may be many, many more in every country and specially in your country

00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:02.420
who are seeking the truth, who are not satisfied by going to the church or going to the temple or just going to some mosque

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:09.660
and they must be wanting to know what is further, what is the Absolute what we have to do but deal with them carefully.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:15.460
Do not force your ideas. They might, by your own life

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:23.440
and your transformation, your happiness and joy, your family life, they might themselves see it so clearly.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:31.040
So in a very gentle way you will spread the good news of sahaja yoga.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.160
Have you any questions now that to know you?

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:46.040
[UNCLEAR] what do you think of the school in India?

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:51.020
- Beg Your pardon?
- You saw the school in India?
- Yes
- What do you think?
- That was very, very good.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:58.940
- The children really made a ice pack factory just to build their vibrations on [UNCLEAR] up to the Spirit.
- Yeah.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:06.240
And also, you see, we have used the colours which will suit the children and we've got all the things and

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:14.420
I'm going to make the teachers also wear clothes that will appeal to teachers and not to be like military dresses, you see.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:22.280
[LAUGHTER] I'm already looking out for some sweet designs for children to wear

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:29.120
because they should know that world is not a  military world but it's world of happiness and joy

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.600
and a sense of beauty comes to them when they see something nice and beautiful.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:39.880
So also like keeping the rooms tidy,

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.520
is easier if you make a beautiful room.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:50.720
If it's a beautiful room the children want to keep the beauty, they want to maintain it beautifully.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:58.140
Also in the school we'll be introducing arts, crafts, so many things, horse-riding,

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:05.640
mountaineering - all these subjects we're going to have for that. I'm sorry you all missed it.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:12.740
[ALL LAUGH]

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:29.820
- It's so nice having all the children from all the countries coming.
- Beg your pardon?
- It's so nice having the children coming from all the countries around the world.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:35.560
- Yeah.
- together
- because, yes and of all the religions - it's such an integration, you know

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:40.820
and they do not have these conditionings or anything and you should see the way

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:46.700
the children greet each other and they haven't got racialism, nothing - you're not to tell them because they're so innocent

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:50.680
and once they develop in that atmosphere, they become perfectly alright.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:05.800
Also we are starting a school there which is called as Arts and Crafts - 21 Arts and Crafts.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:11.820
We're going to teach women how to cook - that's very important. [LAUGHTER]

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:19.000
You can also have one like that because the best way to win your husband is through his stomach. [LAUGHTER]

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:27.860
All agree with it? [LAUGHTER N CLAPPING]

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:34.800
So those who want to enrol should give Me [LAUGHTER]

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.800
So it's done now, I think, I'll go and rest for a while.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:48.320
uh. [UNCLEAR] [LAUGHTER]

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:55.520
[UNCLEAR] so what have you to say about art side of sahaja yog?

00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:02.720
- Well it's [UNCLEAR]
- No, I must potentially think.
- Is a nice intention.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:11.320
Because your creativity becomes so active all the time flowing in you.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.980
Only thing you have to know the technique, that's all. But you never get bankruptcy of creativity after coming to sahaja yog.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:23.860
[UNCLEAR - AND I'M SURE, EVEN SPIRIT?] [LAUGHTER]

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:34.860
Also one more thing about that, about art that I have seen now people have started appreciating

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:40.280
every kind of art - not the uh..  only this type or that type

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:47.880
but every kind of art, they want to see the beauty in it because if once you go to the essence of the beauty,

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:55.540
essence of the beauty, then you start seeing it in everyone because sahaja yoga deals with the essence

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:04.400
and anything that you see, a human-being also, in essence

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:12.800
human-being is a beautiful thing and if you see the essence of that personality then

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:20.060
you get over all these ideas of differentiation or judging others

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:27.220
or thinking that you are the best and rest are bad - all these things just neutralize because you know they are human-beings

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:33.920
and as human-beings everybody is capable of attaining that beauty that is within.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:41.580
After all, we are all one if you see - we laugh the same way. What ever may be you get somebody say

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:49.260
from America or from India or from Australia - they laugh the same way, they cry the same way, they feel the same way so,

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:56.120
I mean, it's just skin deep difference, I think, we have and in sahaja yoga we just get rid of that.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:04.060
It is such a vision of Mine of a very beautiful world

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:09.920
where all wars will end, all problems will end because now you know the Absolute Truth,

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:17.000
so there's no discussion, no argument, nothing. I've seen you people never argue with each other,

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:25.060
I've never seen you quarrelling with each other; Sometimes you pull each other's legs that's good [[LAUGHTER]. That's a good thing.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:30.960
That you must do, I think, that's important. Thats brings out little humour.

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:45.060
- [MARATHI] How much time more?
- [MARATHI]
- Annh?
- [MARATHI]

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:25.380
- Shree Ma, can I [UNCLEAR]

Alright, they'll meet us again after half an hour and we'll be out there. I think, they want to interview Me.

Uh..What's a Goddess - [UNCLEAR] She 's like a [UNCLEAR] with many facets to Her

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:14.860
- I'll put a straight question up to you.
- [UNCLEAR] 
- Just say that someone, a being [UNCLEAR] Divine?

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:23.580
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:32.960
I don't see it that way, I don't see it [UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:39.600
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:47.440
[UNCLEAR] fixes up bits and pieces. You also have grains of sand on the beach [UNCLEAR]

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:53.720
little tiny little, little grains make up the beach in the same way all parts of creation [UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:23:54.200 --> 00:24:02.460
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION] right, thanks.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:13.700
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:20.400
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:30.180
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:38.680
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:43.060
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION] the last time She was here

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:50.560
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:59.140
My wife [UNCLEAR CONVERSATION] Indian lady coming to a public program and She believes in [UNCLEAR]

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:07.700
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:16.280
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:23.080
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:29.560
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:37.540
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:44.360
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:52.300
I mean, I had a little cancer, skin cancer on my hands - it just disappeared.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:59.740
- [UNCLEAR]
- The fact that you've got this energy. It's not [UNCLEAR]

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:07.480
total pragmatic and very reasonable, acts and it's intelligent and it has wisdom

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:14.980
- [UNCLEAR]
 - I know you find something like a cancer disappeared
- Ah.. well, [UNCLEAR]

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:21.340
I would say, I got vibrations, they flow from my hands and I just try this and it's

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:25.380
- it finally disappeared.
- Was it a miracle?

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:31.920
I can't regard it so much as miraculous as another stage of the natural process

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:39.740
in our words - this is something about the life force really [UNCLEAR]

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:47.320
- And what part is Shree Mataji playing in that process?
- Well, She [UNCLEAR] the Great carrier. She is the first

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:54.640
great yogini who is actually in the world behind the process realizations [UNCLEAR].

00:26:55.060 --> 00:27:02.660
I mean, this something absolutely unique and this master of the Kundalini, which is a fact - is the most ancient [UNCLEAR]

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:09.280
and it is straight running through this [UNCLEAR] tradition in the world [UNCLEAR] Kundalini.

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:17.280
- [UNCLEAR]
- Well She says quite specifically, "When you know yourself, you know who I am."

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:25.340
She is not here to set Herself up; We have to realize who She is

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:33.160
- and that's how I [UNCLEAR]
- But I [UNCLEAR] Goddess
- Well, that's right

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:41.620
- [UNCLEAR] She Herself visited Bombay
- But the thing is that you need to realize that

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:45.860
Saying is one thing - is a concept - realizing is just fun.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:54.620
How does that help in with yoga or union, in a Christian society? [UNCLEAR] viewing someone else's perhaps Divine motive?

00:27:54.900 --> 00:28:02.140
I must admit I have pathological suspicion for Indian [UNCLEAR] and in the Christian society

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:10.120
I've never been involved with recognised churches because they right from my earliest times [UNCLEAR]

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:17.920
[UNCLEAR]

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:24.860
step towards the realization of the human potentials and trouble of the whole church things and gives you something but

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:31.840
you know, a lot of it is just taken on fight. I think, fight is the easiest thing in this respect - you cannot even know.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.520
- and this is the next stage.
- Thanks. Great

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:42.580
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:49.440
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:56.400
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:03.480
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:12.420
- Absolutely. 
- [UNCLEAR]
- Haan, the thing that is that, look, you just get a facilitator, a carrier

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:20.480
I mean, look,  let's [UNCLEAR] whatever job you've got, you've got a tremendous tension, you've got all this [UNCLEAR]

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:27.700
[UNCLEAR] now you can cope you have a tremendous strength.

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:34.920
- [UNCLEAR]

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:38.320
- The human potential has not been tapped really.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:48.860
But do you also realize  that maybe we needed a different society which is still worse, which is absolutely focused on materialism and power

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:52.840
[UNCLEAR]

00:29:53.180 --> 00:30:01.100
[UNCLEAR]

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:09.160
It is materialism. Let's [UNCLEAR] what flows and disrupts the society is what flows out of the people

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:17.120
[UNCLEAR] their desire for material things like you also [UNCLEAR] with him or he also [UNCLEAR]

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:26.020
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:34.220
- [UNCLEAR]
- Right.
- Did you get a feeling then something's happening or was just this

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:42.200
- [UNCLEAR]
- I know what you're suggesting. Yeah, nothing to add my suggestion - it was just a pragmatic fact.

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:48.760
You just realizing the [UNCLEAR] through the system and hands. [UNCLEAR]  It's a fact. It wasn't a suggestion

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:55.740
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- And what about this shoe business?
- That's very traditional that came out of

00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:03.540
[UNCLEAR] and it was about, you see, projecting as a [UNCLEAR] to the earth

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:09.880
allowing the earth to receive the things which are really disturbing our personal lives

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:17.040
- and if it's done with the energy field over here [UNCLEAR]
- Yeah [UNCLEAR]

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:26.820
[UNCLEAR] '97

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:34.520
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:41.340
This is the thing about [UNCLEAR] It's not this what happened or that what happened - the whole thing comes down to you

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:48.720
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:54.580
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:59.620
If there's blockages in the system it will stop at here because

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:06.500
the nerve plexus is here. The wave signals down to our hands [UNCLEAR]

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:12.700
so if you feel blockage here [UNCLEAR]

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:23.380
- [UNCLEAR] you get interested in sahaja yoga?
- Annh, should we say, very slowly.

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:30.820
I went to dinner with some friends and had a picture hidden in some flowers one of the television

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:38.220
and seemed to be of an Indian lady so our major reaction was, "Ha, what are they up to here?" and they [UNCLEAR]

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:45.760
it seemed interesting so we said, "Come along to  meeting," and so we to a meeting and saw a video tape.

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:54.840
I don't recall brightly about the meeting except that what was being said about Shree Mataji that time was very pragmatic

00:32:55.780 --> 00:33:03.420
very much conversant you know, so She was appealing to something in me but I had always felt that the

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:11.480
The religions of the world were all rather exclusive clubs and there wasn't a claim to be any way for something to be done

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:18.440
in way of, you know, philosophic ways of life

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:26.100
and here is Someone saying that , "These were all part of a one scheme," and then over a period of about, it's more than six months actually,

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:34.060
I slowly, sort of,  edged my way into this and getting more and more information and feeling more

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:40.620
personally and realizing that there was in fact something going on physically in me.

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:48.880
- And what was that that was happening physically?
- Well, two things. One, at that time I had just come out of hospital having had a prolapse disc

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:57.260
in my right leg, which was virtually useless, and just before I discovered sahaja yoga, I was given the good news that

00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:04.240
that was as far as I was going to go. I had a catapult built -

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:12.260
a special sort of plastic arrangement in my shoe to keep my foot straight - [UNCLEAR] you can't expect any more.

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:19.800
This is as fast, you've got to put up with it. Well, I noticed, even in the first six months, that this,

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:28.220
that healing process was continuing and I can only put that down now to my starting to practice sahaja yog

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:35.620
Uh.. and it has continued. Have been years but it is contrary to medical expectation.

00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:43.140
I still have problems. I'm by no means cured, I can't say that but compared with

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:49.660
what I was like when the period of healing supposedly up

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:57.180
- I'm 300, 3000 % better.
- Is that a miracle?
- No, no, don't think it's a miracle.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:05.560
It is the use of a power that we all have that we can exercise it. Nothing but sahaja yoga is doing, is teaching us how to exercise it.

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:12.560
- And this is a power you can actually feel, is it?
- Yes, yes. That is what,

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:21.140
should we say that is the actualization, what happens when you get yours, what we call Self- realization - an awakening of this energy that

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:27.580
exists in everybody and you don't feel it. It's not something that we say,

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:35.260
we say, "Ah, well, you know we've done this Aabra ka Daabra and there you are. Now you are a sahaja yogi, you've got your Self-realization."

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:43.700
Doesn't work like that. It is something that you actually feel on your Central Nervous System, usually as a coolness either on the palm of your hand

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:51.980
and from the fontanel bone area on the top of the head. Now it's interesting that they call it fontanel bone because

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:59.960
that means fountain. So why is it a fountain? [UNCLEAR] fountain of something coming out of your head and that's what you actually feel

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:08.240
sort of cool coming out of your head and in your hands. Some people feel in your fingers, some people feel it all over them.

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:16.080
Everybody is different but they definitely feel something. In fact, if they don't feel something, then they haven't got their Self- realization.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:22.980
- And what is this Self-realization? What form is it? Like how does it happen? What is it?
- Well. at the base of the spine

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:31.660
there is a bone called the sacrum bone. If we stop to see, "Why is it called sacrum bone? Why is it the sacred bone?"

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:39.320
I mean to say it is a meaningful terminology. Uh.. there is within that bony area

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:45.980
this sleeping energy, if you like, this potential energy that needs to be awakened in a human-being.

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:53.560
And through the medium of somebody like Shree Mataji uh.. this awakening is possible;

00:36:53.840 --> 00:37:01.880
Don't ask me how She does it, I don't know. To use Her terminology, once it is enlightened it's like getting a candle you can light another candle.

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:09.320
Until it's lit, it's no good to you and what happens is, She, She asks

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:15.960
the people that She's giving Self-realization to go through certain, to put their hands on the parts of the body

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:23.740
and to say certain things. Perhaps, the most important is getting the energy passed here, which is the narrow gate,

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:31.380
Christ talked about. And She requires people to be literally forgiving, which people find very hard to do.

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:36.500
Often the people that come up after a program haven't had any sensation.

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:43.040
It is because they have been unable to forgive. So, in a sense it is subtle

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:48.160
but it is expressing itself on the Central Nervous System

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:52.940
Sahaja yogi, what is She? Is She a Divine being? [UNCLEAR]

00:37:53.760 --> 00:38:01.760
In [UNCLEAR - HERSELF?] is a Being who is Divine Power. What is a Divine being? No, She is not a Divine being in the sense that

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:08.440
She has normal parents. She was born in this world so it's, it's semantic,

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:15.940
[UNCLEAR] what a Divine being is but, I think, the soul occupies the body - here we have Divine being.

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:20.720
Did She [UNCLEAR - CLAIMS?] to the miracles?

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:29.740
No, She does do miracles but She doesn't claim to do. Most of the miraculous things have happened because of

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:38.040
- the people having this energy awakened.
- Did She [UNCLEAR - AWAKE THE ENERGY?]?
- Yes She has.
- So therefore she has to be some [UNCLEAR]
- She's a trigger, She's a trigger.

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:42.560
- She is a catalyst, yeah.

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:49.560
How does that feel that saying you are being in a Christian society believe someone else another being perhaps, is Divine?

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:57.660
Well initially not too well [UNCLEAR] told but then I came to realize that that's not actually what we are talking about.

00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:03.000
We're talking about a capacity, not talking about the person, talking about the capacity

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:09.740
so that's [UNCLEAR] it's not great, that's separate

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:17.680
from Her as a girl and in sense this is the same thing. Her capacity to revive this energy

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:25.260
is separated from the light that we see in Shree Mataji.

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:33.920
And [UNCLEAR] it's quite fascinating to watch it. Sometimes She is totally the wife of Mr. Srivastava

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:40.500
the [UNCLEAR] manages the United Nations

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:47.100
other times She is something else again which is quite amazing and you see this change often taking place.

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:52.760
- Better described as a Goddess hence [UNCLEAR]
- I personally think She is - yes.

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:59.220
- A Goddess?
- A Goddess so much over the Gods but as,

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:06.900
I think, that She shows all the signs and says all the things that might make me to believe that She is the person [UNCLEAR]

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:13.920
- [UNCLEAR] the Comforter
- So she is Christ's Mother?

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:21.640
- Yes, She is.
- So She is a Divine being?
- Yes, I'll say so - personally I'll say so.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.880
Thanks, thanks again. Just get your [UNCLEAR]

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:43.120
- Thanks once again. So when did, when did this happen to you? [UNCLEAR]

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:50.920
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:59.100
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:05.180
- Tomorrow what should we expect? [UNCLEAR]

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:12.060
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:20.100
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:28.060
- [UNCLEAR CONVERSATION] SHREE MATAJI
- She comes up to explain how this works. She doesn't have to do anything.
- Alright.

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:36.160
What we do, we have a introduction program, 15 minutes and in between music - about six musicians here travel.

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:44.200
This is a part of the whole program, the whole exercise. [UNCLEAR]

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:49.980
- She says that their music specialists have a particular type of function [UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:56.340
She says that their music which is the heart's [UNCLEAR]

00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:02.980
so we have one, two songs then Shree Mataji will come. She will give Her talk, She will answer

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:09.340
usually asks the audience have any questions, then She gives Self-realization.

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:18.300
So that [UNCLEAR]

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:25.700
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION] What type of questions do you expect first timers over there, lot of people

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:32.960
[UNCLEAR] but mainly questions people first time are vegetarianism, reincarnation

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:40.100
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:46.420
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:54.300
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:42:54.560 --> 00:43:01.880
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:08.720
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:15.200
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:23.680
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:33.780
[INAUDIBLE N UNCLEAR]

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:42.500
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:49.960
No, I mean, [UNCLEAR CONVERSATION] but I certainly can feel life

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:57.420
in a born realized [UNCLEAR] because once you have Kundalini awakening

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:05.220
you can see things more clearly, I mean, [UNCLEAR]

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:13.040
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:20.300
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:28.460
Now as a sahaja yogi what's the difference in your thinking [UNCLEAR]

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:36.640
- [UNCLEAR]
- There was a conscious decision this time?
- Yeah,

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:44.680
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION] then I realized that

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:52.360
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:44:52.740 --> 00:45:00.360
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION] this world is crazy as it is and this is no ways it's going to change, change the inside

00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:08.400
I mean, it's helpless situation always talking, business just - She was going to change the inside.

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:16.740
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:32.540
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:39.200
the grey ones that last in the frame. Michelangelo used it also - they work

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:46.560
they're like an instrument for the Divine power or whatever. Everything rise in the nature

00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:54.400
they go through and the arch is eternal [UNCLEAR], Shakespeare [UNCLEAR] all these great souls

00:45:54.960 --> 00:46:02.680
and people remember them [UNCLEAR] I mean, they remember something that's eternal

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:10.000
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:17.820
It's in every field of life, walk of life, it's not something, as long as

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:25.920
you know yourself then there's help for the world and it first happens in collective [UNCLEAR]

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:49.860
- How has sahaja yoga changed your life?
- I feel [UNCLEAR]

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:56.060
in a realistic way and I see [UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:46:56.340 --> 00:47:04.120
and there's no way you can't [UNCLEAR] you must know

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:10.820
- certainly what's right.
- You were, you were seven when you first started
- Yes.
- Ten years over

00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:15.180
- What's the difference in your thinking now - you were seven year old [UNCLEAR]?

00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:22.720
I've grown up, I should say. Of course, I mean, everyone has their ups and downs but knowing

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:30.400
the Spirit within you, I mean, I'm not a great saint or anything, I'm not anything special but you learn how to say things like that

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:36.880
you learn how to view the world as is and hopefully help to change it

00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:44.320
this mankind if you can change one by talking. I mean, it's obvious you have to change the inside

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:51.140
and it's through this Kundalini awakening of Self-realization [UNCLEAR] that this happens.

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:59.660
- And what is there, is there a conversion process or..?
- It's an evolutionary process and it's what's been preached

00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:07.020
and prophesied for centuries all the great saints and great poets talk about it and

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:15.280
William Blake said, "Men will become prophets and your hands will speak." Once Kundalini is been awakened, you feel as the coolness in hands -

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:23.020
- that's the physical proof, I mean, the benefits are just countless.
- And that's real?
- It's real,

00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:30.220
you feel on your Central Nervous System and that's one of the truths of life and

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:37.060
I mean, it just sounds great but it's not, you feel for sure and [UNCLEAR]

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:44.660
- And what's Shree Mataji's place in all this?
- She's the catalyst [UNCLEAR] I mean you can [UNCLEAR] example

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:51.880
Her whole family is involved in the Gandhi's, Gandhi's movement, I mean, She's been through all that

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:59.900
the long processes of life [UNCLEAR] having family, then being a Mother, now She's a grand-mother. Now Her husband is

00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:07.180
retired. She's travels a lot endlessly  - who in the world does that - name me one person.

00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:14.600
She works all Her time to enlightening [UNCLEAR] with this knowledge that She has

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:21.080
and [UNCLEAR] let the opportunity pass [UNCLEAR] some other claim.

00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:26.840
[UNCLEAR] Is She a Divine being, is She like any one else?

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:34.440
[UNCLEAR - IF YOU FEEL?] physically and if you say what's happened, people have been cured from cancer, people have been cured from endless things

00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:42.460
and now man is walking after having Her medicine - She didn't cure them physically [UNCLEAR] in a way from magic wand

00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:48.940
it's because of in the awakening inside that he could walk on himself. Kundalini awakening

00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:56.360
if you coolness in your hands you can fix any problem in your life and if that happens worldwide

00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:00.640
to thousands then just think who She must be - She's not just anyone.

00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:06.360
- So, who is She?
- I think, She is the Redeemer - I mean, it's very personal

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:13.760
some more aspect [UNCLEAR] but it's time the people, uh.. sort of, stopped what they're doing

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:21.480
- and think about what they're doing in their lives.
- What's your [UNCLEAR]?
- Someone who can enlighten humanity and bring them,

00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:29.420
bring their Spirit to their attention, I mean, [UNCLEAR]

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:35.900
nothing all these theories are fair - communism is fair, democracy is fair -

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:43.080
means what's democracy if we are not free inside. As human-beings we're bound by conditions, we're bound by

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:49.520
money, we're bound by time. How can we be preaching democracy if we're not free,

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:54.640
how can we be preaching communism - all these, all these things.

00:50:54.880 --> 00:51:02.800
- So She is, in your eyes, She is a Divine being very specifically?
- Not such - it's a fact because I felt it physically

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:11.100
If She, if She can raise Kundalini, I mean, saints, thousands of years ago, used to, you know, stand on one leg and do tapasya

00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:19.080
in Himalayas for lifetimes and without achieving [UNCLEAR - LEAST?], if She can do it right now

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:26.280
and on the spur of the moment for thousands, then there must be something about Her being Divine. She must hold

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:33.200
Divine energy within Her and [UNCLEAR] you should doubt that, if you feel

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:41.060
- in a physical [UNCLEAR] that's enough specific way of proving the same.
- Thanks for same.

00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:46.380
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:53.840
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:51:54.040 --> 00:52:01.560
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:09.420
- [UNCLEAR] What are you expecting?
- [UNCLEAR]

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:15.460
- And what have I basically [UNCLEAR]
- They're sahaja yogis as well.
- They are.

00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:20.920
And the who is the coordinator - Baba Mama, we call him

00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:24.600
- he's actually Shree Mataji's brother
- Alright.

00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:30.860
He's once the [UNCLEAR]

00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:37.860
benefactor [UNCLEAR] in India [UNCLEAR] Shree Mataji

00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:46.040
- and play the programs - it's just fantastic.
- How is it different than, sort of, mainstream traditional Indian music?

00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:52.160
- or is it just classical?
- No, a lot of devotional songs. Some of them are just classical
- [UNCLEAR]

00:52:52.360 --> 00:53:00.300
Yes, traditional songs written by saints thousands of years ago like Adi Shankaracharya wrote some amazing poetry

00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:07.700
and put it to music and I mean, they've got some ancient Indian literature to music

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:13.940
- and it's just fantastic.
- Okay, what's the musicians point of view?

00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:20.620
- Is it the melody or the rhythm or what's the attraction of Indian music for you - what do you, what do you say?

00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:28.800
Oh it's the opposite too. [UNCLEAR] there must be, they must have actually become a balance between two and through sahaja yoga

00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:36.580
[UNCLEAR] I mean, integration of Kundalini risen above the brain integrates everything

00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:44.300
in us - music, arts, planning whatever, I mean, we can all do that thing and feel integrated as a body

00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:50.960
- and music is just that, a tool of a Divine energy for everyone to

00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:59.100
- This is, is it [UNCLEAR]

00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:06.660
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:13.940
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:21.420
No, if it's an evolutionary process, it must happen to you, it must help you in your life.

00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:29.060
If it doesn't, then, I mean, it's anything, if you can go on to anything in your life [UNCLEAR]. You sit with us too,

00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:34.640
you sit with two thousand of others, if it works, then you take it.

00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:41.460
Do you think this should be in [UNCLEAR] there should be more hundred followers in Australia [UNCLEAR]

00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:49.800
Everyone must know, at least have the opportunity to know if, I mean, if [UNCLEAR] has opportunity

00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:56.920
to be able to change themselves and then change the world as yourself.

00:54:57.140 --> 00:55:04.980
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:12.540
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:17.180
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:24.640
Whether it be twenty thousand or it be one hundreds, as long as somebody with substance can say

00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:32.220
[UNCLEAR] as long as someone benefits in the end that's all, that's important

00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:39.160
if only one person only comes back, as long as they got a goal over it, as long as they're sincere

00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:46.840
and they sincerely want to hope to change their life, then that's great -

00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:54.060
- whoever, whoever comes, that's just great.
- Yeah, yeah [UNCLEAR]

00:55:54.340 --> 00:56:01.260
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:07.940
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION] You were talking about the coolness

00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:15.580
Starts in the center of the palm and also coming through the fontanel bone area, that's the physical proof

00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:23.040
that you have Kundalini awakening. If you feel heat, for example, it's say, flushing out

00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:29.500
any imbalances within you. If you feel nothing then it hasn't been awakened, it's very clear cut

00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:36.380
but the result of that awakening is what usually makes people stay.

00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:42.500
If it changes [UNCLEAR]

00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:51.100
- And what are You doing? You're having [UNCLEAR] 
- I didn't [UNCLEAR]

00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:55.340
[UNCLEAR]

00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:05.740
That's tomorrow night. Is that drying You physically? Is it

00:57:06.260 --> 00:57:13.080
- No, not [UNCLEAR]
- No. What I hear, an experience?
- I enjoy. No problem, I enjoy it.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:18.380
- What sort of responses have You been getting from people in this trip?
- Very good, I must say.

00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:24.960
Suddenly they have come up with this new urge

00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:34.380
- and the questions they ask also are very sensible.
- What about, what about asking [UNCLEAR]?

00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:40.200
- They ask questions about the Kundilini
- Yeah

00:57:40.460 --> 00:57:44.820
- uh.. whether it's an energy or whether it's a

00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:53.300
- something material.
- Yeah. Is it - how do You spell it?

00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:57.880
Kundilini - k-u-n-d-i-l-i-n-i

00:57:58.060 --> 00:58:06.060
- How do you explain it today, what do You say about?
- It's an energy, it's an energy but you can see the movement of the energy in some people.

00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:15.520
If there is a, say problem, on any one of your centers, then you see the pulsation

00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:24.040
- even on the triangular bone in a very strong way the bone starts pulsating just like heart.
- Yeah so this physical vibrate

00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:30.720
- Yes that is - you can see it physically.
- If You had any, what decide to say that tonight?

00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:34.500
- Tonight [UNCLEAR], I mean, what are the Russian scientists?

00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:39.160
- Russian scientists are, you see, they are fed up with science, they say.
- Are they?

00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:47.320
Really. They say, "Now give us Self-realization." They're very deep people, I must say because - haan, very

00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:55.180
because one of the scientist asked Me a question there that, "You tell us how did You cure people

00:58:55.380 --> 00:59:01.200
just while you were having the mass program?" I said, "I don't know if somebody is cured."

00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:05.560
He said, "Yes my friend was cured and how did You cure?"

00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:11.900
- For example, we have doctor here
- Yes
- he had eczema for, I don't know, how many years. "Doctor, how many years?"

00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:19.300
- [UNCLEAR] Shree Mataji.
- Annh?
- [UNCLEAR]
- Three days he was cured.

00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:29.080
- And that was just through the awakening process, was it?
- Not the awakening also, you see, it's the vibrations.

00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:36.900
You see, if you put, if you put your, if I put hand in this water,

00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:43.600
- Uh.. what do we see?
- Vibration, you don't see

00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:50.120
but once you have got realization, then you can see in the sky

00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:58.180
- there, there, they are there - see all of them are like this. Can you?
- [UNCLEAR]

00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:05.500
- No, no, not in [UNCLEAR], in the sky
- Yeah.
- You see, it's little bit you can see like small commas,

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:14.380
sparkling commas - you see it finally? Alright, give Me My [UNCLEAR]

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:18.760
You can see it clearly - I can see it.

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:27.140
- [UNCLEAR]
- You see, it's a subtle thing na, so you have to be subtle yourself, you see.

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:34.400
but then you see some sort of loops. Now let's see. Can you see some loops

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:43.400
- Are you alright?
- Just a second Shree Mataji.

01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:12.240
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:18.240
- And then what are we looking out at, Shree Mataji?
- You see, you see, when you see in the sky

01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:26.220
- Alright so, where do we start from, Shree Mataji? You had better hold it
- You have to get your realization. Alright, let's see, let's start that way.

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:34.800
Alright, now, just raise his Kundilini. If you can take out your shoes, will be better because, you see, this Mother Earth gives us,

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:41.000
She sucks in all our problems also quite a lot - you are not aware of it, you see, but she does.

01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:47.260
- So we're going to have connection with the earth.
- Yeah, yes, that's very important - it's like the earth feel
- Alright.

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:05.740
- Now, the first thing you'll feel like a cool breeze in your hand
- I can feel the Sun on that palm

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:12.660
No, not the... there's cool breeze as yet? You have to forgive, you have to forgive everyone

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:22.180
- I can feel the cool breeze there.
- See.
- But that's from your hair
- No, no - you'll feel it now.

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:27.020
- [UNCLEAR] it again.
- Again, haan

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:36.600
- I can't feel it - warm
- Alright, raise it again, doctor. You see, it's a very subtle thing, na so it takes...

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:43.180
- I can feel something cool on there.
- Alright, let's put it up.

01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:51.720
Now, in this hand?

01:02:54.460 --> 01:03:01.240
- I can feel the rush of there, Your hand
- No, no, just see that, don't doubt it, it's there. Just see now.

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:15.640
- What am I going to feel?
- You feel a little cool breeze going in, you see. I think the [UNCLEAR]
- It's not there?
- Too much thinking

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:23.220
- See, too much thinking
- Too much thinking, that is my problem
- Yes. Let Me correct that part

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:30.440
- It's too much thinking, you see, it's alright.
- [UNCLEAR]
- Hmm, you'll be alright

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:40.220
In Auckland one interviewer felt like cool balls of ice

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:47.660
- What do I feel like?
- You'll feel the same way, you'll feel the cool breeze. You see, this part is too much thinking and not forgiving.

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:55.480
- Just forgive, forgive everyone. See this is like a mountain here, you see.
- Hmm, hmm - that's true - too much thinking
- Hmm.

01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:03.660
Futuristic planning, futuristic personality. First you'll feel very relaxed also.

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:11.820
No thought - hmm, better.

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:18.580
Now in the hand? Take out your coat, I think it'll be better because

01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:22.880
- I can feel my hands cool
- Cool you're feeling [SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS] It's alright.

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:28.120
- But I still think it is the breeze.
- No - the breeze from where? Just see, the trees are just silent.

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:35.420
It's started. These trees are silent, aren't they? Just a [UNCLEAR]

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:39.660
Not even a leaf is moving. Now can you feel the cool breeze in your hands?

01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:44.980
Haan, you'll also feel out of your head

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:53.240
- Can You feel any? Can the doctor feel any?
- No, not yet. This is quite heavy here.

01:04:53.860 --> 01:05:01.400
- It's a thick head.
- You have to just say to your Kundilini  is your mother - so you have to just say in your heart seven times,

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:05.300
"Mother please come in my head," and she comes, she does come.

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:20.180
Hmm. Now [UNCLEAR]

01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:30.220
- Works very hard. [UNCLEAR]
- I'm a hard case
- No, no, no you got it. It's final. Just see on the head

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:38.160
- And what am I meant to feel?
- [UNCLEAR]
- Yes, it is

01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:55.160
You see, this Kundilini, is the power of pure desire. Pure desire - all desires you have,

01:05:55.380 --> 01:06:01.640
supposing you want to have a coat, then you like to have a shirt, then you'll have to have a car, then

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:07.880
a house - goes on and on and on but this thing is a desire which fulfills. Now, let's see, it's shaking -

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:15.940
why it's shaking the hand? You see, too much of right side - see. I told you - put him left to the right.

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:24.100
- It will last. See now, it should not shake
- That's because I have my hands up, I feel

01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:32.420
- That won't shake. Sit comfortably. Still shaking, see. [SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS]

01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:40.900
- See, the trouble is
- What does that mean?
- That means you are running a very hectic life.
- Quite possibly very hectic life.

01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:48.220
- But that's just nervous.
- Yes, it means you're nervous and that shows immediately.

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:52.780
- That nervousness is shown. See now, on head

01:06:57.100 --> 01:07:02.400
- And what's that suggesting? Is the Kundilini arising?
- Arising but she is, she is, she is nourishing

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:06.340
your nerves, so you are feeling that - should be alright.

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:16.420
You have to steady down. You people have a very hectic, heavy life.

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:21.880
Better now, see much better.

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:32.060
Hmm - better? [UNCLEAR]

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:36.100
My head is actually

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:48.280
not very comfortable position.

01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:56.760
- [UNCLEAR]
- Sit back, relax
- Relax, sit absolutely comfortable

01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:00.120
- See now, hands are better now [UNCLEAR - FEEL NOW?]

01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:08.740
- So what's state of my nerves?
- The state is that you're crossed this part but you haven't yet crossed this part - alright?

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:22.580
You relax, you'll feel relaxed yourself, don't have any thoughts in your mind.

01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:38.220
Hmm. Feel this center?

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:45.380
Your hands have become steady

01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:52.740
Hmm

01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:10.200
- Better?
- Yes, very well.
- You relax, hmm?
- My surroundings are a nice afternoon

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:17.280
- No, no keep your both the feet on the ground.
- Alright
- Nothing to do, you are quite shaking

01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:27.020
One has to accept the truth, you see, that's the problem with you.

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:34.380
[UNCLEAR] left right, [UNCLEAR - WHOLE?] sympathetic.

01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:44.180
- What does the Truth have to do with the nervous system?
- Haan, just. Now you are feeling these vibrations in the hands, the coolness in hand

01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:48.920
You see, now this is how you become

01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:53.600
a person who has got Collective Consciousness.

01:09:53.820 --> 01:10:00.180
That means, with this you can feel your own centers and you feel others

01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:09.140
and you can also feel the centers of others on your finger-tips. It is already described in Koran, very clearly,

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:15.460
that, "At the time of resurrection the hands will speak and they'll give witness against you."

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:22.920
Just now your hands were giving witness that you lead a very hectic life and that, as if, you are against yourself in a way.

01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:30.960
Better.

01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:44.500
But in the collective, when we have masses, it works much faster

01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:50.620
Just in 10-15 minutes thousands can get realization.

01:10:53.400 --> 01:11:00.720
In the same state. Now see the cool is there; Come and see.

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:09.560
- They all know this very well - have the full idea.
- They have experienced this, Mother?
- Yeah, they're experts, you know, they are all experts.

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:18.460
- [UNCLEAR] you've got a very big one. [UNCLEAR] Yeah, must feel it now, the cool breeze.

01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:25.200
- Alright?
- It's a subtle feeling in the hands, subtle

01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:31.320
- I'm trying very hard, Shree Mataji
- You can't feel it anything? Nothing cool on your hand?

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:37.920
- Annh?
- [UNCLEAR]
- Yeah, this side. Now?

01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:47.280
I could feel a little bit of cool on my palm, [SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS] That's because of probably  this hand [ALL LAUGH]

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:59.280
And now there are no leaves moving - haan! See, now see with the other hand also once again.

01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:04.800
See the other hand, raise the other hand.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:17.480
- Now?
- Umm, I'm trying very hard.
- Can't get any cool breeze? It's up there
-

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:27.560
- We all can feel it. Annh. Now?
- Yeah, little bit.

01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:33.500
[SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS] You're not get away, You are not get me to admit it. [LAUGHTER]

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:38.880
- There are all these people can they feel?
- Of course. They are experts.

01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:46.100
- You can feel it, you can all feel it, can you?
- Yeah, yeah
- Of course they can feel, they can cure, they can
- So what's the matter with me?

01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:52.220
- Thank You very much! [ALL CLAP]
- [UNCLEAR]

01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:59.560
[UNCLEAR -SHOWS?] your relaxation. Actually, little bit you have to fix your connection

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:06.940
- So I have to be faithful with myself [UNCLEAR].
- Of course, you should not be blind at all about it

01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:14.560
You have to be very truthful with yourself and you should find out yourself and

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:21.860
you should certify yourself. Nobody is going to certify you though we feel it, you see, on your head you will feel but

01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:29.800
- also your this center is not alright very much, the way they were shaking
- Yeah
- that shows also you write too much - do you write?

01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:38.000
Use your right hand too much so that's why there's a little tension but it's alright, it will all work out

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:45.520
- I feel better already. Okay, are you ready?
- Sure.

01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:54.000
- His face is changed
- In what way? [UNCLEAR] bad experience. Am I different from

01:13:55.200 --> 01:14:02.260
- when we started that experience or ?
- Of course.
- In what way?
- You relaxed and

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:07.440
you grow younger.

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:12.700
- But some would say, "Of course, I'll be relaxed." I mean, nice surroundings
- No

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:19.200
- You inspect me in a very serene way
- Even if you are in the bathroom, you'll feel the same - anywhere. Nothing to do with surroundings as such.

01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:25.880
It's something inner happening which takes place, that's how, as a result of that you feel that way

01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:34.780
and it's been described in many ways even in, in the Bible they say, "I'll appear before you like tongues of flames."

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:42.160
So, these centers that are within you - the subtle centers - they really look like a flames, very

01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:49.940
gentle flames of different colours but in the brain they are about thousand, like petals but they are like

01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:55.660
flames, you can say, because the petals don't open and close like that - see very [UNCLEAR] see there

01:14:56.140 --> 01:15:02.800
way the limbic area is covered like this and when it opens, it opens like this

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:09.900
but see, now in your case your right side is more active. What you have done, you've covered it like that.

01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:17.980
so we had to put a little balance so we raised your left more and put you to the right. By doing that,

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:21.740
little bit [UNCLEAR - TURN?] then we could open it.

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:29.720
- Did You do this on a large scale and You do this with a lot of people?
- That's, if there are many people, it works faster.

01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:36.860
Then I don't have to touch anyone, just works but because you're alone here working it out, that's why it took time.

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:44.280
- But it's a collective happening.
- Is that message, suggestion?
- No, no suggestion is there, nothing

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:51.080
but only thing is that, tell them how to have their Self-confidence with themselves because

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:57.600
mostly they're diffident and things like that so I have to just tell them there are different centers on the left-hand side

01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:04.920
and you just put your left hand towards Me - means it's symbolic that your desire is there and then you have to just nourish

01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:12.400
yourself because then you know what it is like. Nourish yourself and then suddenly you find, you become cool

01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:19.400
- and your hands you start feeling.
 - How do You explain that, how do you explain this power You have to work this feeling?

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:26.980
Then it's like the Mother Earth. How do you explain how Mother Earth gives us this flowers?

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:33.520
It's the living process, is the evolutionary process and this is now the last breakthrough.

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:39.980
At human awareness we do not know the Absolute. We have no

01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:46.140
Absolute knowledge and that's why we fight, you see,

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:54.000
but if everybody knows the same thing, there's no quarrelling, no fighting, nothing but we live in a relative world.

01:16:55.080 --> 01:17:01.520
To get out of this relativity we have to be the Absolute and Absolute is your Spirit, which is actually in the heart

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:10.380
but what happens that this part, this is the center of, this is the seat of the heart -

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:17.740
the fontanel bone area - the seat of the heart so as soon as you touch that, the Spirit

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:25.260
is manifested on your Nervous System. So first you get it, this feeling,

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.580
then gradually it grows, you see, because it's a subtle feeling - starts growing.

01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:38.960
With these you can easily make out what's wrong with yourself, first of all. That's now your this thing was shaking too much, you see, these.

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:46.520
This is the thing for too much thinking. This center is futuristic, creative also -

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:54.280
person is creative; Gets this problem with this one and the whole hand was shaking,

01:17:54.540 --> 01:18:00.860
right specially - means you are very right sided and according to us, a right sided person

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:06.760
is a person who is more an extrovert - you can call -

01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:13.260
a person who is always planning, thinking, futuristic, also physical uh..

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:21.100
- problems show on this finger.
- But why have You been called to awake this feeling [UNCLEAR]?

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:27.480
- Why, why, why have I been
- Why have You been called to do this, to be the catalyst?

01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:34.900
I mean, somebody has to be called, I mean, it's uh.. Me has called, now you may be called.

01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:40.820
- You see, it is the
- So you [UNCLEAR - LOOK ON?] as the Divine power that You have?

01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:47.780
You see, I, I don't say I have that power because, you see, I'm rather careful about Myself. Trouble is,

01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:53.200
Christ was the Son of God; I know for definite He was.

01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:59.040
But when He said that they crucified Him. You see, people don't want to accept the Truth.

01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:05.000
When He died then you build His temples and things like that but till He lived nobody listened to Him.

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:09.040
So best is not to tell them about Yourself - that's My own style.

01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:16.020
- But You, You have a remarkable power, how do You used for Yourself? Who is Shree Mataji?

01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:22.000
- I. I see My, I cannot put Myself into any category what to do.

01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:29.060
I don't see Myself - I, there's nothing to see. I know that this work has to be done by Me. I see this

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:37.480
- This is why I'm on this earth.
 - But You don't explain that power. How do You explain this power? Where does it come from?

01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:42.860
- and why You?
- I think, I was chosen for this, perhaps.

01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:51.220
- That's all I can say - for this work.
- You've been described as the Redeemer, as a Goddess,

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:57.280
- [UNCLEAR]
- Divine - what do You say about those description?
- Must be something like that

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:04.180
You see, it all started with, in the West by some people from England

01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:10.200
wanted to know about the Holy Ghost that Christ has said, "I'll send you."

01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:18.880
So they went to many people, tried to find out and tallying it but when they came to Me, they found that I can do all these three things very well.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:24.320
First thing because I can cure people, I can give comfort

01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:32.820
and I can counsel them, I can tell them all about it about all this subtle knowledge which they do not know

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:38.860
then I redeem them because they can get this breakthrough.

01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:44.560
That's how they're changed but I never say what I am. It is for them to judge.

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:51.220
- Did You say that you work miracles? 
- I didn't say that also.
- That is something I can't do. These other people also can't do.

01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:58.760
I also don't say that because in these days of darkness, it's better not to claim anything so I don't say that.

01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:06.080
But those who have seen it - miracles they have seen, so they say it miraculous

01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:12.680
but no use, you see, now, for example we have some photographs with us - tremendous - so many photographs we have

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:20.020
which you can call them absolutely miraculous, out of the blue - but you show it to somebody who's not a realized soul,

01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:24.640
they will say, "It's just a," - no use showing them.

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:32.920
You see, human-beings don't believe in God in the real sense of the word. They don't know there's Divinity.

01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:38.720
They don't also have faith in themselves, you see. So from this stage they must rise little higher.

01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:44.280
As My father used to say that, "Those who are on the ground floor

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:50.820
must at least come to the second, third floor to know that there's something beyond otherwise how will they come to You."

01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:57.820
- You come from a Christian background
- Yes, I do.
- what changed Your way from Christianity?
- What?

01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:03.500
- turned You away from Christianity? Did Christianity [UNCLEAR]
- I'm not at all, I'm the greatest Christian, I think

01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:07.980
because I know about Christ everything and I work out through Him -

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:12.560
I'm the greatest Christian; Christians don't practice Christianity at all - they don't.

01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:20.800
They're just the other way round. Christ has said, "You'll be calling Me 'Christ, Christ' I won't recognize you."

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:28.860
I'm not against Christ, I'm very much for Him and I can't tolerate the way people talk about Him -

01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:37.300
- just I can't tolerate, is all falsehood.
- So where do You see Yourself in relations, in relation to Christ?

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:44.160
- Just explain that relationship as a, as the Redeemer. Explain that to me.

01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:51.640
He has already talked about Me like the Holy Ghost and all that but it is for you to find out. You have to see, I don't want to see.

01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:56.940
You have to find out if I'm the Redeemer or not; What He has said about the Holy Ghost.

01:22:57.140 --> 01:23:02.540
First of all, they have cancelled any feminine power in the Bible, by Mr. Paul and company.

01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:09.340
Paul is just a, like somebody who entered into Christianity.

01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:16.980
He never saw Christ, nothing of the kind. He saw a very good platform for Christians. Just jumped into it, organized the whole thing -

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:25.100
He was an organizer, thought it was a nice platform for him, then Augustine did the same but there's still hope because

01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:32.380
Thomas - disciple of Christ - he went to India through uh..

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:39.480
Egypt. There he has written his treatise which are now being decoded and all that

01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:46.460
after forty-eight years and he said the same thing what I am saying that, "It's a experience, there's a spontaneity,

01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:52.560
it's collectivity," everything he has talked about but, I think, that book is banned, perhaps, I don't know.

01:23:53.960 --> 01:24:01.080
You talked about  this Kundalini, this physical thing, kind of a thing. How can You explain that just what is it - Kundalini?

01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:09.220
Is the, is a power within us, all the time waiting within us to give us our second birth in the sense

01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:15.200
that, like I would say that now you have this instrument here

01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:22.220
and it has to be connected to the mains, isn't it, otherwise it has no meaning. In the same way it is coiled up within us

01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:27.160
and just it connects you to the mains, that's all - it's that simple

01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:34.220
- So we connect with one and all?
- Yes, you get connected with this All-Pervading Power

01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:40.240
- and this All-Pervading Power everybody is connected; You can call the subtle of all the elements it is.
-

01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:46.460
And then once you are connected with that, just like remote control you say

01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:54.260
or a remote uh.. way of, the way your television works, you see - everybody feels the same because they are connected.

01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:59.940
Can You explain the miracles that happened ?- You work, people say that You were working them.

01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:06.040
For instance, what happened the next year? Do You think your presence in that conference [UNCLEAR],

01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:10.440
- that had anything to do with what happened there the next year?
- Yes but they are very deep people.

01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:15.560
- No, why do You think it, how did You affect what was going  to happen the next year?

01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:21.700
- You see, actually - how can you explain now how did this flower came out of a seed - tell Me?

01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:27.780
It's a living process, it's built-in; It's all built-in within you and just works.

01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:35.240
- So what special message did You give those delegates when I went back home?
- That you have to become one with the Divine,

01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:41.820
you have to get your transformation if you want to see human-beings saved, being saved

01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:50.080
and this whole world is to be saved, then you have to take to it. But it's a hypothesis world, you see, you need not accept Me blindly.

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:57.420
-  It's a hypothesis but if it works, then as honest people you must accept it.
 - But You still claim

01:25:57.700 --> 01:26:02.800
[ASIDE CONVERSATION]

01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:09.780
I do not claim anything because I know to claim anything means you have to go to courts - but it works.

01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:19.080
I'd like to get You to explain this earlier better [UNCLEAR]

01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:27.580
- what the roles
- What the?
- roles, what the Redeemer should
- roles. What was the role of Christ?

01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:37.140
What is the role of Shri Krishna, what was the role of Shri Rama?

01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:45.960
They were like human-beings - Christ came up to this point,

01:26:49.060 --> 01:26:56.520
this point and now the last center has to be opened out; Somebody has to do that -

01:26:57.100 --> 01:27:03.340
- it could have been you or it could have been Me - anyone could have been.
- There is a call - You have been called.

01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:07.360
- That's a fact.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:15.740
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:24.440
- Shree Mataji can you tell us what the Redeemer is?
- Redeemer is a person

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:32.420
who gives you your second birth, who connects you to this All-Pervading power,

01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:38.540
who makes your Spirit enlighten your attention.

01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:46.420
When your Spirit is enlightening your attention, your attention itself becomes effective.

01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:49.740
You pay attention to something, it works.

01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:54.860
It's, human-being is a  very big thing.

01:27:56.040 --> 01:28:01.740
We do not know the capacity of a human-being how he's made - is a very special thing -

01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:05.120
is the epitome of evolution.

01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:13.000
Like, we will say, you take a small little television set to a remote village. They'll say, "What is this box,

01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:19.020
good for nothing?" - but once you put to the mains, then they will know how fantastic it is.

01:28:19.620 --> 01:28:27.120
In the same way the man has to discover his own glory, his greatness. He's getting lost in the superficialities.

01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:34.920
- And You're the person who can awake their feeling in people. You are the
- No, it's their own power, it's within you.

01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:40.380
It's like one enlightened light can enlighten another. Like these people can do the same.

01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:45.220
So, it's one candle which was enlightened is enlightening another candle.

01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:50.720
But You have been called to do it and there is a Divine calling.

01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:59.680
Whichever way you want to call it, you can call it but actually, it had to be done - that's all I can say.

01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:07.420
- As such, do You view Yourself as a Divine being with this power?
- Nai, It's better you find out about Me.

01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:11.980
Suppose, if I say, "I'm Divine," must you believe it? - you should not. What's the use of

01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:18.820
- A lot of these people say You are Divine being and in fact a Goddess.
- They, they, because, because, because, because they have experienced,

01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:26.660
they have felt it, they have got their realization. They can cure people, they can redeem people,

01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:33.880
they can raise the Kundalini and their lives are changed, you see, so many were there drug addicts -

01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:41.600
overnight they have given up, there were alcoholics - they have given up alcohol; They are leading a very sane married life,

01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:47.780
they have beautiful children, they are beautiful people and we are this time,

01:29:48.020 --> 01:29:53.720
we had a seminar in India - every year we have - we had people from fifty-five nations -

01:29:55.080 --> 01:30:02.040
are such beautiful people. There are about five thousand people, no problem, no fight, nothing.

01:30:04.180 --> 01:30:08.240
Just enjoying each other, helping each other

01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:17.300
- These vibrations , what are they?
- These are the ones which this power is flowing through you - that's how you feel them -

01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:23.080
is all around and then you should know only how to use this power;

01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:31.300
This is the power which is already there, it is - this is one of the Truths which you have to feel. Once you start feeling on your Central Nervous system -

01:30:32.300 --> 01:30:37.760
to feel on your Central Nervous System , is the knowledge - and then you should know how to use this power.

01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:41.700
What does this mean, what does that mean - that's all.

01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:45.480
How do You do that on a mass scale?

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:56.460
This is very simple. You see, I make them touch their different centers

01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:01.820
and they ask for it - that's all. [UNCLEAR] works out.

01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:06.400
- And how do you explain that power which [UNCLEAR]
- It's there

01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:15.660
It's there, I should say. How do you explain the power of the Mother Earth - you can tell Me that?

01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:23.100
She doesn't claim anything, She's there. You know that if you put some seed into earth, it will sprout - that's all.

01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:31.600
Simple as that. It cannot be explained, it is to be felt and to be understood and to be used.

01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:40.660
How do you explain electricity - any power whatsoever? How do you explain your power of looking at Me? It's there - that's all.

01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:48.740
Would You disagree with Me when I call You Divine, a Goddess? Would You disagree with the scriptures out there or not?

01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:57.120
I'll not agree on this angle. Now I've become very clever because the way people have tortured all these great Incarnations

01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:02.040
and all these prophets, I'm not going to run any risk like that.

01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:09.180
What sort of law they say is safe for women in society in groups like aborigines [UNCLEAR]?

01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:15.200
- aborigines in particular [UNCLEAR]
- Of course very much, they are very much needed

01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:22.140
You see, they are on the contrary not so complicated but, I would say, the modern man is much more complicated

01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:28.520
than these aboriginals are. They have  gone little further than they should have. Say, supposing you start from here.

01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:35.240
You come up to a point, here you have to rise. Now they have grown like that. Now because of their ego they cannot come back.

01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:41.140
but these people can be brought in - there are many aboriginals who have got realization. All religions -

01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:48.540
you see, we have Muslims, we have Jews who -  now the Jews are the ones who really worship Christ because they know what Christ is.

01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:56.840
- Who in Your mind is perhaps the saddest person? Is it the person who finds Truth and then goes away

01:32:57.480 --> 01:33:02.820
from there? Who would you describe as the one, perhaps, who is needy this much?

01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:09.800
You see, I have had many mishaps, specially, in this country. They came into sahaja yoga, like Muslims,

01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:17.860
and then, I think, they became like Paul or something - they wanted to assert their power because they thought that's everything

01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:26.340
and then they started making money,  without telling Me - all such things, you see, these things, these are wrong sometimes and if you do not meditate and

01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:33.120
put your correction permanently, then you can fall. Still in your ascent there could be a problem.

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:39.140
- So people have been evolved with the sahaja yoga movement and then left

01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:43.920
- Some
- because they, because they found to make money, Mother?
- Yes money - money they made

01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:50.360
and we had someone who was a homosexual and

01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:58.360
he was alright to begin with but again he was caught up with the same. Then he started troubling sahaja yogis,

01:33:59.060 --> 01:34:06.620
then we have people who are, sort of, running after women, sort of people. There was one like that

01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:13.740
- and then the women complained that , "Mother, you see, this man is no good."
- What was that? What was [UNCLEAR]?

01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:21.040
You see, just troubling women, harassing women and it came back to him, somehow or the other, the same thing.

01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:25.700
He started doing it, you see, they are not such uh..

01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:30.800
ardent seekers - they are not the people who are seriously seeking

01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:39.260
so then they go waste. Like we had somebody - we brought him here all the way. He was an artist, he became a great artist and all that

01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:47.540
and he wanted to become the leader of [UNCLEAR] and all that - sit on the horse earlier and put the hat on

01:34:48.220 --> 01:34:55.620
- so among thousands there could be few also.
- What about those people perhaps who have, had to leave the

01:34:56.660 --> 01:35:03.360
movement and have been emotionally affected by what they've been through?

01:35:03.580 --> 01:35:08.220
No, you see, they are not emotionally or anything - they just tell lies.

01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:11.940
They have been very unkind to us - we've done so much for them.

01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:20.440
Worked so hard on them, everything we've done what was possible under the Sun but they have no sense of responsibility,

01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:27.180
they have no self-respect and the way they have lynched people and troubled them is very wrong.

01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:33.540
- What sort of lies did they tell about
- What?
- What sort of lies did they tell about sahaja yoga?
- Lies?

01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:39.240
I don't know what they say. One of them started saying, "I'm Maha Mataji - I'm the great Mataji."

01:35:39.660 --> 01:35:43.940
And everybody ran away from that person because God knows what was he up to.

01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:49.020
They, then now he's no where, no where [UNCLEAR]

01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:55.820
What about crimes did You have actually threatened people that they will contract AIDS and cancer [UNCLEAR]?

01:35:56.920 --> 01:36:02.900
I'm not that kind. You see, when, when these people go away

01:36:04.140 --> 01:36:10.560
uh.. actually they do not go away, we have to ask them to get out - very difficult. They don't want to leave.

01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:18.680
Very difficult to ask them to get out but when we have to ask them to get out we say that, "You meditate at home, purify yourself and then come

01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:25.400
because you shouldn't spoil others." Then they get angry and then they start. It's always in, you see, it's always so

01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:34.280
because they think that we have asked them to go and all that; We cannot have such bad apples to spoil all of them. You see, they have no right to do that.

01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:41.040
A lot of them now might say that they didn't feel
- They are living in?
- they didn't feel. They are frightened.

01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:48.420
Yeah, might have been because, you see, we had one leader here who was, who became a Hitler

01:36:48.660 --> 01:36:55.880
but these people never told Me he was like that. I discovered it Myself. You see, there was one fellow who suddenly became like that.

01:36:56.400 --> 01:37:02.600
And specially, in Australia I had very bad experiences of three leaders who did that way.

01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:08.840
- What does that do then to Your credibility?
- You see because I am now all over the world, you see,

01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:14.980
and when they came they were very nice people. Actually they were the first who came to seek, seeking

01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:20.360
and they said, "We can start the work and all that alright." They were very good to begin with

01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:28.820
but then suddenly I don't know how - you see because, I think, they gave up meditation, they gave up their practices to keep themselves

01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:35.220
pure. Like if you don't cleanse yourself, you get dirty - that might have happened to them - I don't know what happened

01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:43.200
but normally I don't think, they are against Me, they are more against these people. I don't think they have reported things against to Me or some.

01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:50.680
- Does that upset that this sort of things happen that
- No, we have to take it
- what it does, it does to Your entity?
- See, it's not upsetting but uh..

01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:56.900
I feel that one learns to experience uh..

01:37:57.100 --> 01:38:00.160
that you should have a better watch on them or things like that.

01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:07.800
You see, in other countries like India, England and all that we have a better system because we have Chartered Accountants appointed

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:15.600
who go through the accounts and things, see things what these people are doing - I never collect money - I don't know what they're doing and how they are

01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:21.960
but in Australia I couldn't get anybody like that. Now we have 3-4 Chartered Accountants

01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:30.580
and things will work out. Is actually, it starts with money only. I think, it starts with money. First is that, I think, that

01:38:30.980 --> 01:38:37.320
they'll start collecting money saying that, "This is for this project and this is for this," something like that

01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:41.420
and these people without asking Me just start giving the money.

01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:50.060
Then they think that they're now making some money out of it. Now, then they think that it's better to put a fear

01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:56.840
in their minds. Even they say that,"You should not write to Mother anything about it. We'll do it," and

01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:03.560
I don't know why but in Australia people very much accept the situation like that.

01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:10.780
It's more in Australia. In other countries they'll just write to Me immediately because I've told them always to write to Me.

01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:17.840
- Where do You get Your money from to run all this?
- I don't get any money whatsoever. Only when I travel My husband used to

01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:24.460
pay - he used to pay for halls also. First time when I, twice when I came to Australia, I paid for the halls and everything

01:39:24.980 --> 01:39:32.460
but now these people - they have self-respecting, so they pay for the hall. This is hired; This is purchased or hired? - I don't know.

01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:40.260
- Purchased. 
- Purchased. This is purchased by these people. They are living - I don't know their accounts and all that. I'm not [UNCLEAR - INTERESTED?]

01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:48.180
Only thing, when I travel, now they've opened a international fund - which I don't know what they're doing about it

01:39:48.380 --> 01:39:52.960
and that's how they pay internationally and that's how I travel.

01:39:53.280 --> 01:40:00.240
- What's the message tomorrow night which You're to bring to them? Is that
- Is that, you should all get your Self- realization,

01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:07.380
you should know yourself because you do not know yourself and by knowing yourself you'll know everybody else

01:40:07.620 --> 01:40:14.360
and then by that you will know how great you are; You'll develop that self-respect within yourself.

01:40:15.060 --> 01:40:22.140
You will know what is virtue is; You will be proud of your virtues and the so called ideas

01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:30.480
about righteousness just become part and parcel of you. You become righteous. You don't have to tell them, "Do this, do that," they just do it.

01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:37.220
I'll give you an example like, supposing we are standing in darkness - can't see - and we are holding on to a snake, supposing,

01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:45.360
and you are obstinate. Somebody says, "This is a snake." You will never drop it because you are obstinate, you can't see

01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:53.040
till that things bites you. But supposing, there is little light, then you yourself drop it out. In the same way it worked out.

01:40:53.800 --> 01:41:01.460
But in India, you see, I don't have so much problems because we traditionally we know about it very well. This has been going on for ages

01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:08.760
but traditionally it was such that only one master had only one disciple only till the 12th century.

01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:17.300
In the 12th century, one great saint called Gyaneshwara, he wrote a book - treatise about Gita. In that

01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:24.800
he requested his guru to give permission, at least, to write about it. Then in the sixth chapter he wrote it.

01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:31.400
After that many poets in India have written, many people have said it and uh..

01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:39.620
- Why don't You like Paul?[UNCLEAR]
- Annh?
- Why don't You like Paul [UNCLEAR]?
- Paul is the one who's ruined us completely.
- How?

01:41:40.380 --> 01:41:47.320
See, because he took our attention from Spirituality to organisation. He organised us, you see.

01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:55.040
See, organisation is wrong - you cannot organise God. You cannot organise, you cannot organise Christ, you see.

01:41:55.760 --> 01:42:00.020
So this is the mistake. Once you get organised, then you are finished.

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:05.900
- What is your relationship with God?
- God? [SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS]. I think, you better find out,

01:42:06.180 --> 01:42:13.780
I don't want to say anything because saying anything, why should you believe Me? Again I say. I don't want to say anything. You find out what is My relationship

01:42:14.100 --> 01:42:20.180
to God. Must be something special but for that

01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:27.820
- everybody has to come up to a point because I don't want to force My ideas or anything.
- More special than anyone else here?
- Yes.

01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:37.140
You see, supposing I'm talking to you about something histology then you have to bring a microscope, isn't it, to see it?

01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:43.380
What's the use of talking about it? So once you have that microscope, you can see yourself.

01:42:43.900 --> 01:42:51.060
- So You are above us? You are, in a [UNCLEAR - WAY?] a Divine being.
- I'm not going to say that either,

01:42:52.460 --> 01:42:57.900
- in no way.
- Thanks Shree Mataji, [UNCLEAR] thanks very much!

01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:07.240
Alright, yeah, yeah - sorry. Just another quickie.

01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:13.780
- Hmm, I should have asked this earlier. About the talks of true and false prophets.
- Yeah

01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:16.960
How do You recognize the difference between those two?

01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:23.040
First thing is that anybody looks at your pockets, you can know - first thing.

01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:31.240
- Secondly,
- What do You mean by that?
- Just if they ask money, if, like Rolls Royces they buy,

01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:37.260
see out of your money, they make business out of your money - naturally

01:43:37.540 --> 01:43:45.060
such a person - I don't understand even banking, you'll be surprised, but apart from that it's better to do this way

01:43:45.260 --> 01:43:51.560
that you find out the people who are following that master.

01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:59.280
What sort of people they are? Are they righteous, are they happy with each other, are they collective,

01:43:59.860 --> 01:44:07.840
what is the difference because if you want to go to a master you want to have something more than what you have - isn't it?

01:44:08.020 --> 01:44:14.860
Then you should see what have they got from it and then go - just blind-folded you should not join something

01:44:15.780 --> 01:44:21.160
and you should not believe anyone blindly but they're all can be found out because they are in the market.

01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:28.180
they're marketing everything - everything they are marketing. So many have been found out now recently we had

01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:34.080
horrible report about Muktanand; If you read, you won't eat food for eight days - you better read that.

01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:37.620
- Why You a true prophet?
- Annh?
- Why you a true prophet?

01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:46.320
- Why...?
- Why are You a true prophet?
- I'm not saying that - did I? No I said you must
- But you're not a false prophet?

01:44:46.540 --> 01:44:53.160
I did not say that also. Whether I am false or not, you better judge it yourself

01:44:53.800 --> 01:45:01.480
by talking to all these people, first of all, and then if I take any money from you, then you cancel it.

01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:09.500
Then what you have to see is that what you gain out of Me. If you gain something out of Me, well and good otherwise why should you

01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:13.240
have a prophet? What is the need to retain a prophet?

01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:19.360
- So, You not admit to be a Divine being or a Goddess but You admit to being a prophet.

01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:26.440
No, I'm not saying that. You're just trying to put into My mouth something which I will not accept - I never said anything.

01:45:26.740 --> 01:45:32.240
I said you better get your realization. Once you get your realization, then you will know about Me better.

01:45:32.620 --> 01:45:39.000
Is not proper to know Me without getting that special status of Spirituality.

01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:47.420
See, I'm not saying anything, I'm not claiming anything, I've never claimed anything because I know how dangerous it is to claim something.

01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:54.840
But what is the need to claim, I mean, what do I gain out of it - nothing. I mean, I'm not fighting for elections,

01:45:55.260 --> 01:46:00.900
I'm not asking for any position - nothing. 
So why should I claim anything, what is the need?

01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:07.000
I'm here just to give you your own key, that's all, so why should I claim?

01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:13.840
- Thanks Shree Mataji! It's okay.
- You understand. May God bless you!
- Thank you very much.

01:46:17.860 --> 01:46:22.740
- Any more questions?
- No more questions. You've questioned Me, I think.

01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:29.360
- I'd like to well
- Please come to the program.
- Yeah, we'll [UNCLEAR] tomorrow, for sure.
- Yes, yes

01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:36.380
- Sure we'll be there.
- If it is something uh.. worth telling people, I think, you journalist

01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:44.300
- have to know your responsibilities.
- Can I represent
- I think, you Russian journalist are so good
- Are they?

01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:52.520
[UNCLEAR - INDEED OR AGREED?] They published about Me in magazines which is given to all the

01:46:52.780 --> 01:47:00.140
- the aerofloat planes and everything
- Yeah.
- They're so full [UNCLEAR N INAUDIBLE]

01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:08.360
I, I never did anything for them as such, as I do here but the way they were open-minded, so open-minded

01:47:08.740 --> 01:47:12.220
even the Ministers came to My program.

01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:18.760
- Have I, is there something in their psyche, their personality might not be
- See, they're not so conditioned

01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:25.300
we're very conditioned. At least it's, we are very conditioned by ideas, things like that and they are the ones

01:47:25.500 --> 01:47:32.660
they themselves go and find out. They don't listen to anybody like that, they just go and find out themselves.

01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:41.160
And I had met only two, three Russians who went down and told, "Mother, is coming." Also they are quite sensitive, I think, because

01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:47.100
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

01:47:47.340 --> 01:47:52.780
No, they didn't accept all these false gurus. They threw them out one by one -

01:47:53.460 --> 01:47:59.800
they wouldn't accept - and, I don't know, what sensitivity they have that because

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:06.120
some people told Me they dreamt about Me uh.. that I'm coming and all that

01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:12.520
but I, I don't know how they take to Me so much and can you believe that we had to hire

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:20.080
uh.. stadiums for 16000 people, 14000 people minimum and they all got realization

01:48:20.340 --> 01:48:26.100
What [UNCLEAR]

01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:33.020
[UNCLEAR] there're other, perhaps,  religions

01:48:33.620 --> 01:48:36.800
[UNCLEAR] other ways of thinking

01:48:37.020 --> 01:48:43.860
Oh, this is the integration of all the religions. We prove that they are all related to each other

01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:50.680
and it's only we are fighting, as I told you, with the flowers which are dead

01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:56.560
and saying, "This is mine, this is mine." Those flowers were grown on the same tree of spirituality;

01:48:56.760 --> 01:49:01.980
They're all related to each other - we can explain. Even logically we can explain everything,

01:49:02.420 --> 01:49:08.740
but, you see, when they are so self-opiniated, everybody thinks, you see, for example, you see, Indians think Hindus are the best,

01:49:09.020 --> 01:49:17.140
all the Muslims think they are the best and the Jews think they are the chosen ones, the Christians thinks nothing better than that - so what can you do to them?

01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:24.060
- If some people generally they try to be good to their fellow-men I think
- That's limited

01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:32.000
- [UNCLEAR]
- You see, when you do something - yes. If you do something good to others, you see, still you develop a kind of a ego, very subtle it is

01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:39.000
- Yeah
- but in this you don't say that
- So you're not after anything?
- No - in this what happens, your ego is opened out

01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:45.500
so when you're doing something, you don't say you're doing it - like he said, "It's coming, it's going."

01:49:45.860 --> 01:49:52.180
- He didn't say, "I'm raising," - nothing. I, I is not there. "It's coming," you become a third person.
- Sure. Do You think there's a, there's a

01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:58.380
danger in talking about being connected with other individual thinking

01:49:58.580 --> 01:50:05.900
with which the universal [UNCLEAR]. You think, there is a danger in [UNCLEAR] like tend to lose our identity

01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:14.160
- to be cut off from
- No, on the contrary you really know your identity better because you don't know yourself, you don't know much - what do you know?

01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:21.440
- I mean
- I have a personal idea because
- That's outwardly, inwardly you don't know why these problems are there,

01:50:21.700 --> 01:50:28.760
- why things happen to you - you don't know anything.
- So, You basically have to say that people rather forget everything that You [UNCLEAR]

01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:36.920
- you know your essence, you see, you know your essence. For example, now supposing, this tree is sick. Now I try to put some medicine on it -

01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:45.160
- it cannot be cured - you have to go to the roots
- Yeah
- so you go to your roots and find out your roots and you know what it is - it's very simple.

01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:53.460
- [UNCLEAR] that we have inside that's the [UNCLEAR - CAVE?]
- Beg your pardon?
- The Kundalini is the cave

01:50:53.760 --> 01:51:00.740
The Kundalini is the connection and you enter into the Kingdom of God - is what it is, as simple as that.

01:51:02.300 --> 01:51:09.980
What sort of [UNCLEAR] saying that in Australia 600 practising followers.

01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:16.960
- What about worldwide? Is there..
- I am very bad at accounts. Steven, can you say how many there are in the world?

01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:25.560
- See, I'm very bad at accounts, I can't say but there might be [UNCLEAR]
- But do You think the gurus take very much, charge money

01:51:25.780 --> 01:51:32.380
- [UNCLEAR] the other way
- Yeah
- Yeah

01:51:32.780 --> 01:51:40.380
They are thrown out in no time. Now I know where to put My finger. You see, before that I thought that how can these

01:51:40.580 --> 01:51:47.580
people make money? I trusted them because basically I think, human-being is a good being and he wants to be good

01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:55.060
but sometimes these things come up. Here, you see, in the West you have certain problems which I can never understand like homosexuality

01:51:55.940 --> 01:52:02.880
uh.. coming back in sahaja yoga or something like making money and all - I can't understand.

01:52:03.240 --> 01:52:10.000
Say for an Indian, no body would touch the money anymore but I find here they because

01:52:10.220 --> 01:52:16.460
- What's Your view on homosexuality?
- Annh?
- What do Your view on homosexuality?
- You see, then you become normal.

01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:23.820
You see, a homosexual becomes normal, he marries nicely, then he leads a very normal life.

01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:31.880
- So, he becomes a heterosexual?
- A normal, yes. You see, it comes out of hatred for women sometimes, it comes for hatred of men sometimes

01:52:32.100 --> 01:52:38.840
acquired for, because of certain experiences maybe, or maybe some thing in the atmosphere. I don't know how they become that way

01:52:39.080 --> 01:52:46.660
- but in any case in sahaja yoga they get corrected completely - they lead a very normal life.
- So they come back to the normal?

01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:51.920
Yes, they become very normal - that's the point - in every way. They become extremely normal people.

01:52:52.140 --> 01:52:56.700
So, what about Christian homosexuals? What's your view on that?

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:03.540
Is wrong - how can you have the clergymen like that. The other day only I read in the newspaper that in America

01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:11.500
they said that, "If the women want to have ordain, they wanted to be ordained, then they should be warned that the clergymen harass them."

01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:18.980
I mean, this is not possible if they are religious - how can you do that, isn't it? It's very funny. That means the religion is outside, it's not thing inside.

01:53:19.180 --> 01:53:24.680
You see, you may be Christian, Hindu, Muslim - you do all kinds of sins, how can you be anything?

01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:29.660
- What about women in Church? Is there a place for women in Christian Church?

01:53:30.060 --> 01:53:38.080
Of course, it should be but somehow or other they cancelled. They never talked about Holy Ghost, that's the feminine power

01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:45.520
and they never talked about Mother of Christ in that way. For us She's a Goddess - for us She's a Goddess.

01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:52.740
Thanks, Shree Mataji [UNCLEAR]

01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:57.900
I don't know what all these people going to do if they have the time for the rest of the afternoon?

01:53:58.160 --> 01:54:04.040
Ah, they enjoy themselves. They are never bored - that's one thing, they are never bored - they enjoy themselves.

01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:09.300
- Good! what are you doing Nick?
- [UNCLEAR]

01:54:18.300 --> 01:54:25.540
So, who other, so through Self-realization who else gets with psychological problems Shree Mataji

01:54:25.740 --> 01:54:33.280
- Of course.
- Psychological problems?
- Of course, of course. Psychological - see, physical, psychological

01:54:33.660 --> 01:54:38.660
spiritual. Spiritual problems come because so many

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:44.520
-  false gurus are there and they create problems
- False?
- Gurus
- Yeah, false gurus

01:54:44.900 --> 01:54:50.540
- so they create problems in the Kundalini and they
- So, so something like homosexuality comes.

01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:57.420
- This is a proper mean, person's Kundalini - yeah
- It makes you normal person and

01:54:57.620 --> 01:55:03.900
actually what happens you become really a free personality in the sense that nothing dominates you.

01:55:04.340 --> 01:55:09.580
No addictions, no ideologies, nothing - you're free absolutely

01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:17.500
and you are capable to be free because people are not capable to be free that's why this problem is there.

01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:24.440
Democracy becoming demonocracy - why? Because we cannot bear the freedom but after this freedom

01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:28.680
you are wise as well as free.

01:55:30.060 --> 01:55:36.880
So you don't even to be, it mustn't be like [UNCLEAR] the ideology or anything like

01:55:37.460 --> 01:55:43.800
We don't believe in ideologies as such but we know the essence of all the ideologies are the same.

01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:50.620
For example now, take it say, capitalism. Now I'm, if I have powers, I am a capitalist

01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:55.560
but I can't live with My capital, I have to distribute so I am the greatest communist.

01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:59.880
- Hmm, hmm. So you're being just [UNCLEAR]
- Yeah

01:56:00.140 --> 01:56:07.160
- So all ideologies merge together - it's complete integration, it's complete.
- Yeah
- When did You [UNCLEAR]Quiz Pass? Where is that?
- Pardon?

01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:14.000
- The UN Organisation's quiz pass. Did you win that one year- the Quiz Pass in the UN?

01:56:15.220 --> 01:56:22.900
Not Me, uh.. no, no not Me. My husband was Secretary General there and

01:56:23.620 --> 01:56:29.760
the Queen has given him this highest award - the highest - which I think, Reagan has got only

01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:37.820
- and My husband has got this highest award,
- Really?
- Yes, of Knighthood and also he's got 31 awards more

01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:45.600
- Yeah
- from major awards. He's a very unique person 32 awards but he openly says, "It's all because of my wife

01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:52.080
-  I've got blessings because of Her because She does good to others that's why I've got blessings."

01:56:52.300 --> 01:57:00.160
- He was, he was with the United Nations and
- He was, now he's in Delhi nowadays. He's writing a book about Lal Bahadur Shastri

01:57:00.940 --> 01:57:08.140
- so he's there. He talks to Me on the phone.
- Right. Do You one would You be busy this afternoon, do You have any more engagements this afternoon?

01:57:08.380 --> 01:57:14.080
- Tomorrow do You have any other engagements before the?
- I'm always engaged somehow
- Yeah

01:57:14.340 --> 01:57:21.140
- We have people here. With problems they come, I have to solve problems and things.
- What do You think of this ashram? Is it the first time You've been here?

01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:27.680
- It's very nice. It's one of the oldest ones they started off and it's very good and a very nice people here

01:57:28.060 --> 01:57:31.520
and the first time I came to Australia, I came here, this ashram.

01:57:31.820 --> 01:57:38.160
- Do You think Australia has a, has a unique place on the world or is it any different, any special place?
- Very much, very much, you see.

01:57:38.540 --> 01:57:45.580
Basically, they don't know, they're not aware but they're very innocent people - they're extremely innocent -

01:57:45.780 --> 01:57:51.280
Australians are, and their innocence is exploited

01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:59.060
and they are trying to follow these countries which are not so innocent like America or France. I don't think

01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:06.360
- they're very innocent countries.
- Hmm, hmm. It would be better [UNCLEAR - TURN?]
- Yes
- Turn our back against [UNCLEAR]

01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:13.860
You should look at, into yourself. They are very innocent, no doubt - you have innocence

01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:18.960
personification here, I think, they're extremely innocent, that's always what My ideas of Australians are.

01:58:19.300 --> 01:58:26.600
- Is it a good thing?
- It's very nice to be innocent because you're powerful. Innocence has it's own power.
- Yeah, yeah

01:58:26.820 --> 01:58:34.300
- But there's such an attack of innocence -  [UNCLEAR] it's so perverted.
- You lose it, you lose innocence?
- No you never lose

01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:42.640
never lose - that's the best part of it - never lose it. It can be covered, it will be clouded but you don't lose it - it's always there.

01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:49.720
In sahaja yoga it always comes back - that's what I found sahaja yogis in Australia, they're very innocent, very innocent.

01:58:49.980 --> 01:58:57.480
- So innocent that anybody tells them, "Give so much money," they will give;
- Yeah
- They'll not even ask Me - so simple!

01:58:57.820 --> 01:59:03.660
I told them, "Why don't you ask Me for what is this money, where is it going?"

01:59:05.240 --> 01:59:13.180
- They must worry about the [UNCLEAR].
- Now I warned them, all of them, that, "You have to write to Me directly.
- Yeah.
- if there's any such thing."

01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:18.760
- So they won't [UNCLEAR]
- Yeah, I warned them, very much, before

01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:28.980
because they're so innocent. This has not happened anywhere else but in Australia - because they don't inform Me.

01:59:29.400 --> 01:59:35.820
They go on suffering, they don't tell Me anything that people have been frightened and all that - they never tell Me.

01:59:36.520 --> 01:59:42.200
So this is a sign of innocence that you should accept this kind of a domination of someone

01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:51.600
- But obviously, it's not doing Your credibility any good because
- No, credibility is not like that because, you see, human-beings have

01:59:51.820 --> 01:59:59.320
been given a freedom to go to Hell or go to Heaven. There I cannot play any role. I cannot bind them to Me, you see.

01:59:59.720 --> 02:00:06.760
- Yeah
- It's your choice - you can go to Hell or you can go to Heaven; I can only tell them the path of Heaven

02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:14.860
but if they want to go to Hell, I cannot stop them - that's one thing - because God has given you this freedom. Human-beings have got this freedom, animals don't have any.

02:00:15.300 --> 02:00:22.300
Only the human-beings have got this freedom, you see, so it is for them to use whichever way they want to use -

02:00:22.640 --> 02:00:29.760
how can I stop them? I, I do not govern them, I do not control them - they are controlled by themselves.

02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:34.040
Is alright, that's [UNCLEAR]

02:00:40.340 --> 02:00:47.060
- Terrific! Thanks, Shree Mataji, thanks very much.
- May God bless you!
- Yes. May God bless You! Thanks for [UNCLEAR]

02:00:47.380 --> 02:00:52.220
[CLAPPING]

02:00:52.580 --> 02:00:57.120
- that's the biggest audience I've ever heard.
- It is, it is
- a lot of my programs, they're going to be on TV

02:00:57.320 --> 02:01:02.220
- It is
- [UNCLEAR] I hope these people are writing this book.

02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:06.280
- Alright, anyway, enjoy yourself so thanks Shree Mataji.
- May God bless you!

02:01:06.540 --> 02:01:09.800
- and hope to see You tomorrow.
- Yes, that's very kind of you.

02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:17.600
- You'll be there right around, won't You? [UNCLEAR]
- You see, first they have some little music for - one, one song they sing.

02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:24.880
That's before I come and then I speak about this, the Truth part of it

02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:31.600
- introduction tomorrow and day after tomorrow, I'll explain more
- Good!
- Alright?
- So you're going to get people back for second go?

02:01:31.800 --> 02:01:39.360
- On the second night, they come back on the second night too.
- You are coming second night?
- No, no let the people come, the audience come back to You on the second night

02:01:39.740 --> 02:01:46.480
- Or is it two different audiences?
- No same, they repeat. They always, they always repeat.

02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:52.420
- Yeah, good.
- Bring more friends, more people. Second day we have more people, much more.

02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:57.680
- I didn't get your name?
- Mark.
- Mark?
- Mark Warren.

02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:28.620
- Did you offer them some tea or not?
- We did, Mother.
- Give them some cold drink to drink.

02:02:29.300 --> 02:02:32.680
It's very hot, very hot for them.

02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:39.040
Let them sit in the shade, I think.

02:03:00.540 --> 02:03:04.300
- What's it?
- It seems the clouds are almost clear.

02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:10.740
You wanted the Sun, so it's alright.

02:03:16.820 --> 02:03:20.720
- We're all finished now.
- Unnh? It was nice.

02:03:23.060 --> 02:03:30.100
Because we have to give it to the B.B.C.  also something they wanted to have so I'll tell them this one is sufficient for them

02:03:31.160 --> 02:03:38.280
because when I'm there, they are not there so we'll never meet. Funny way how to [UNCLEAR]

02:03:45.260 --> 02:03:48.220
Ha!
