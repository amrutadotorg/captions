1
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:59,780
Today 

2
00:00:59,780 --> 00:03:22,859
is 

3
00:03:22,859 --> 00:13:12,649
the day we 

4
00:13:12,649 --> 00:20:02,830
are celebrating Easter.

5
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:17,820
Easter is extremely symbolic, of - not only
of Christ, but also for all of us.

6
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:31,299
In that the most important day is that of
resurrection.

7
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:47,289
The resurrection of Christ has 
the message of Christianity, not the cross.

8
00:20:47,289 --> 00:21:01,269
Through resurrection Christ had shown that
one can be resurrected with the body that

9
00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:07,640
you have.

10
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:18,950
And without His resurrection, we could not
have managed the crossing of Agnya chakra,

11
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:23,230
no doubt.

12
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:36,620
His life was very short of, we can say three
and half years only, He lived there.

13
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:47,049
He came to India and He met Shalivahana, and
Shalivahana asked His name.

14
00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:48,440
He told him His name was Isa Masih.

15
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:57,000
But He said, "I am coming from the country
where there are malichchas, mala-ichchha.

16
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:08,289
They have ichchha of mal, desire to get dirty,
and I don't know how to live there.

17
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:10,770
To Me, this is My country."

18
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:21,799
But Shalivahana said that, "You should go
back and save Your people and give them Parama

19
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,920
Nirmala Tattwam.

20
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:34,000
So He went back, and as it is, within three
and half years He was crucified.

21
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:44,600
At the time of His death He said so many beautiful
things for forgiveness, but ultimately He

22
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,940
said "Behold the Mother."

23
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:53,680
That means you should hope for the Mother.

24
00:22:53,680 --> 00:23:04,649
And in His lifetime He also said that, "I'll
send you the Holy Ghost Who will comfort you,

25
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:11,519
counsel you and also redeem", means resurrect
you.

26
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:20,890
All these things He had said it because He
knew what was the whole plan.

27
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:29,820
Also He said that, "You may say anything against
Me or do anything against Me, but anything

28
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:37,159
against the Holy Ghost I will not tolerate.

29
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:42,010
I will not tolerate at any cost."

30
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:51,250
Which is true also, so it is very dangerous
also to go against the Holy Ghost.

31
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,450
No doubt about it.

32
00:23:53,450 --> 00:24:01,309
It's not Me that is dangerous, but these Deities
are extremely dangerous.

33
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:11,600
So, in Sahaja Yoga you are all resurrected
with your body.

34
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:19,600
Before this you were not connected to the
All Pervading Power, and whatever you did

35
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:25,720
was through your mind or through your emotions.

36
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:44,210
But you did not come out of that grave of
emotions and your desires, your actions and

37
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:48,769
your ego.

38
00:24:48,769 --> 00:24:54,570
After realization now you know how free you
have become.

39
00:24:54,570 --> 00:25:08,169
How you have developed your own personality.

40
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:20,039
There are so many instances which we can talk
about Christ, that He said, "Know Thyself"

41
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:21,149
throughout.

42
00:25:21,149 --> 00:25:25,081
He knew without knowing yourself, you won't
be resurrected.

43
00:25:25,081 --> 00:25:29,929
But Sahaja Yoga is the other way round.

44
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:35,790
You get your resurrection and you know yourself.

45
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:44,399
It's a very Sahaja, sweet way of getting realization.

46
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:53,029
But if you see to the life of Christ, He has
talked about murmuring souls.

47
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:59,720
We too have in Sahaja Yoga, because it's open
to everyone, all kinds of people come.

48
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:10,470
We find very shallow people coming to Sahaja
Yoga who try to express their shallowness

49
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:25,850
and talk in a very, in a very loose way, about
Sahaja Yoga, about the work of Sahaja Yoga.

50
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:34,120
So that was inevitable, but what Christ has
said that you have to be careful about the

51
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,070
murmuring souls.

52
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:40,970
And this is exactly - we have to be very careful.

53
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:48,100
When you come to Sahaja Yoga, in the beginning,
you may come across such people who are murmuring

54
00:26:48,100 --> 00:27:01,750
souls, you may be enticed by them because
they are a kind of, we should say, messengers

55
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,440
of negative forces.

56
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:10,080
And these messengers of negative forces, you
should try to find out.

57
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:16,529
They'll complain about this, complain about
that, they talk in a very loose manner, and

58
00:27:16,529 --> 00:27:29,840
when you see that they are not talking in
a positive way, you should run away from them.

59
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:36,309
Because only by getting your resurrection
you are not all right.

60
00:27:36,309 --> 00:27:42,340
After getting your resurrection, after your
Self-realization, you have to grow.

61
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:52,240
And for that growth we have to be very careful
about how we get impressed by all these, I

62
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,139
should say, very frivolous people.

63
00:27:56,139 --> 00:28:02,690
Those who grow into it become beautiful angels.

64
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,179
No doubt about that.

65
00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:11,400
But that is one thing one has to know is to
respect your Self-realization.

66
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,340
You shouldn't worry about what others are
talking, what others are saying, what they

67
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:24,159
are criticizing, but you should look at yourself
and all the time try to grow into your depth.

68
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:30,100
It's a very great chance of life that you
are being resurrected, and this is the last

69
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,529
breakthrough, as you know, of our evolution.

70
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:39,970
But now you should leave your mind on one
side; because this mind, if you go on working

71
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:48,399
with it, you cannot go beyond mind and Sahaja
Yoga you can achieve by going beyond your

72
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:49,740
mind.

73
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:54,990
Then you know yourself, because you get Self-knowledge.

74
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,649
You know about your centers.

75
00:28:57,649 --> 00:28:59,899
You know about the centers of others.

76
00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:08,440
All this is available to you, but you have
to become a subtler and subtler person.

77
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,509
Not a gross personality.

78
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:19,080
If you become subtler and subtler, you will
be amazed how you will develop your inner

79
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:24,510
powers in so many different ways.

80
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:30,490
But there are people in Sahaja Yoga, I have
seen, who are very ambitious.

81
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:36,350
And they start saying that, "Mother, we want
to be God realized.

82
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:39,039
I want to be this and do that."

83
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:46,180
There is no office going on here that you
give somebody a promotion.

84
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,520
You have to grow yourself.

85
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:53,030
Then they start proclaiming, "I am this, I
am that."

86
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,179
We call them 'Mahayogis'.

87
00:29:55,179 --> 00:30:00,529
Some of them had started saying that they
have reached very high positions and they

88
00:30:00,529 --> 00:30:05,049
ended up in the lunatic asylum.

89
00:30:05,049 --> 00:30:13,669
All such suggestions if people give you, then
you should shun such people.

90
00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:20,620
But there are also other people who join such
a bombastic fellow.

91
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:30,179
So, you must remember that this last judgment
is working and all the time there is a big

92
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:41,510
sieving out, a very big arrangement of choices.

93
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:47,009
Those who are subtle, start getting subtler
and subtler and subtler.

94
00:30:47,009 --> 00:30:57,220
But those who are frivolous, gross, idiotic,
stupid, they start frittering away.

95
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:06,929
So this last sieving starts very fast, working
out where we realize that where are we.

96
00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:11,460
Now what is the criteria for that?

97
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:19,190
First is your compassion.

98
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:26,279
Your compassion must be discrete.

99
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:30,830
Sometimes people only have compassion for
negative people.

100
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:39,840
After Sahaja Yoga you should know for whom
you should have your compassion.

101
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:47,460
With vibrations you can find out, very easy
to find out with vibrations - what sort of

102
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,570
a person you are facing.

103
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:53,299
But first you must have vibratory awareness.

104
00:31:53,299 --> 00:32:05,990
If you don't have vibratory awareness, you
won't be able to find out at all what is correct

105
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,929
and what is incorrect.

106
00:32:07,929 --> 00:32:14,630
So it is important that you all must mediate.

107
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:19,200
Without criticizing yourself, anything, you
can just meditate everyday.

108
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,760
Is very important!

109
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:29,259
I immediately know who is the person who is
meditating and who is not meditating.

110
00:32:29,259 --> 00:32:30,259
Immediately!

111
00:32:30,259 --> 00:32:39,720
The person who meditates is very clearly an
angel.

112
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:51,629
The whole reaction, the whole behavior, the
whole attitude of such spiritual maturity

113
00:32:51,629 --> 00:32:52,629
manifests.

114
00:32:52,629 --> 00:32:57,809
And you are amazed.

115
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,690
As you know Sahasrare Mahamaya.

116
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,850
It's not easy to understand Me.

117
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:10,990
For the time being you might know what I am,
but suddenly you will forget.

118
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:14,659
That's the trick.

119
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:20,590
Because if you know Me in full ways, you won't
even sit here.

120
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:24,450
You won't even come nearer to Me.

121
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:33,250
So that Mahamaya is acting all the time, but
that's the only way you can judge people.

122
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:37,190
This last judgment is not a easy thing.

123
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:41,510
Even if you put thousands of judges, they
cannot do this judgment.

124
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:49,509
All the time you have to know what is what.

125
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:56,640
And somehow I know everything, but I will
never show that I know.

126
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:07,820
That's how I work it out, and gradually I
know what I have to do about that person.

127
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:14,680
This resurrection of yours is much more blessed
than that of Christ.

128
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:18,570
He was alone; people wouldn't recognize Him.

129
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:26,550
He had to show His marks where they had put
nails on His hands and feet.

130
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:30,280
But today that is not the situation.

131
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:36,570
Only thing is, first of all you have to recognize
Me.

132
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,040
That's all.

133
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,139
Need not know Me.

134
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:41,139
It's not easy.

135
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:47,780
It's difficult to know Me, but if you recognize
Me, that's all.

136
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,940
And it all depends on your sensitivity.

137
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:59,390
Your resurrection has to be complete and you
have to mature in Sahaja Yoga.

138
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:05,480
If you cannot mature, I will say you should
leave Sahaja Yoga.

139
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:14,940
Go out for a while, where you will understand
what's going on, then you'll come back.

140
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:26,470
In Sahaja Yoga, like Christ sacrificed His
life, is not expected of you to sacrifice

141
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,470
your life.

142
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,710
Your Mother doesn't want that.

143
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:40,589
But you have to do some sacrifices, like you
have to stay in uncomfortable places in Ganapatipule

144
00:35:40,589 --> 00:35:43,490
sometimes, or somewhere.

145
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:54,309
You have to face many odds while traveling,
also coming down here may not be so comfortable

146
00:35:54,309 --> 00:35:58,030
as you are at your place.

147
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:03,250
But the main sacrifice is of your ego.

148
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,309
You have to crucify your ego.

149
00:36:05,309 --> 00:36:15,020
The ego is the one, which teaches you all
these nonsensical tantrums that people know.

150
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:27,450
If you can surrender your ego - just surrender
your ego - that surrendering can help you.

151
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:36,700
But if you surrender your ego by thinking
about it, then you are using your mental capacity.

152
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:44,130
Everything you do like that is through your
mental capacity, by which you are using your

153
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,410
ego.

154
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:54,360
So the best way is to meditate, to go into
thoughtless awareness and there automatically

155
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,790
you are surrendered.

156
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:59,410
Now what do I have to have from you?

157
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:00,410
Nothing!

158
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:01,410
I don't want anything.

159
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:03,420
I don't want to have anything.

160
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,790
You are the ones who try to give Me this and
give Me that.

161
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:09,750
I am trying to run away from all that.

162
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:15,359
Just for your satisfaction also, I agree.

163
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:23,310
I don't have to do Sahaja Yoga Myself, but
that's the love of your Mother.

164
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:32,569
That She wants to save as many as possible
- all that are created on this Earth - to

165
00:37:32,569 --> 00:37:34,420
give them their resurrection.

166
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:38,619
This is a special time and you are My channels.

167
00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:47,829
You can go all over and spread Sahaja Yoga
and try to help others to come out of it.

168
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:55,990
Today is a day of promises, where we have
to promise ourselves that we'll grow in a

169
00:37:55,990 --> 00:38:08,280
very deeper understanding, or feeling, or
in sensitiveness of Sahaja Yoga.

170
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:15,750
This growth has to take place for which I
have to meditate.

171
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,329
This is a very important thing.

172
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:24,609
Secondly, people say that here people are
very miserly.

173
00:38:24,609 --> 00:38:27,770
They are not willing to do this.

174
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:32,630
They don't want to pay any money for this,
pay any money for that.

175
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:36,390
I think generosity is one expression of your
love.

176
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,550
You will give Me, all right.

177
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:45,880
When it comes to expenses, either I pay or
somebody bears the burden.

178
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:54,160
Now things have improved, but still we should
know that this tremendous work has to be done

179
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,510
and we need money for that.

180
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:00,190
I don't need, I spend My own money.

181
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:11,140
But generosity is the best and this generosity
is very, very important for Sahaja Yogis.

182
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:16,780
I have seen people are very meticulous sometimes,
very calculating.

183
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:20,950
They will tell Me, "Bring some sarees for
them."

184
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:23,599
Take some sarees, all right, very good idea.

185
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,860
And they say, "We don't like it, we don't
want to buy."

186
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,980
I am not doing any business.

187
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:32,620
I buy it because you wanted, I have selected
it.

188
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,450
Then to say, "we don't want to have it."

189
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:39,869
There's no business, there's no marketing
going on.

190
00:39:39,869 --> 00:39:47,020
And this is the problem when I don't understand
Sahaja Yogis that they should know Mother,

191
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,720
Herself, has put in Her money.

192
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:56,599
So what is there also, they should say, "take
little more for Sahaja Yoga."

193
00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:02,500
After all such a big organization going on,
and there are so many countries who cannot

194
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:07,450
pay a single farthing, for them also one has
to pay.

195
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:11,120
Now, Christ was sold for thirty rubles.

196
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:16,670
You can imagine, He was sold for thirty rubles.

197
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:25,839
So that shows that when you do not try to
understand the financial difficulties of the

198
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:34,270
organizers and you do not help, you are really
selling the Christ within you.

199
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:42,329
You cannot sell Christ, you cannot sell Sahaja
Yoga.

200
00:40:42,329 --> 00:40:45,850
But that doesn't mean you exploit it.

201
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:51,890
So I have to tell you that I was Myself surprised
in north India where I least expected people

202
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:56,599
are extremely generous, extremely generous.

203
00:40:56,599 --> 00:41:08,690
And then generosity helps you, in a way that
our Lakshmi Tatwa is to be awakened.

204
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:15,260
I had to bring in this point because I have
complaints from people that people are reluctant

205
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:20,730
to pay for anything like this.

206
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:28,839
It's very remarkable that some people take
over, but everybody must contribute.

207
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:34,079
It's important, because you are doing God's
work.

208
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:39,859
You have to also come forward to do other
things that are there without grudging.

209
00:41:39,859 --> 00:41:40,940
Enjoying it!

210
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:48,410
I was happy the posters were put by the Sahaja
Yogis, and you can see the whole place vibrated.

211
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:53,099
You could see how it has worked out.

212
00:41:53,099 --> 00:42:00,030
So everybody must go all out to do everything
that is possible.

213
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:07,549
Nothing else is needed but your full heart
into Sahaja Yoga.

214
00:42:07,549 --> 00:42:09,570
Then you will see how you will grow.

215
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:16,020
It is only through your heart you will receive
all your nourishment for your spirituality.

216
00:42:16,020 --> 00:46:31,490
So open 

217
00:46:31,490 --> 01:52:22,559
your heart, do 
not calculate so much.
