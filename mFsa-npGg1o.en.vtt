33:52.712 --> 33:59.360
I wanted to be with you people
on a Christmas day,

33:59.704 --> 34:03.248
but it never happened before.

34:03.448 --> 34:09.409
It has so chanced that I have to be here
with you today and on the New Year.

34:09.610 --> 34:12.581
Something good has to happen
I hope next year,

34:12.782 --> 34:16.485
some good luck has to come.

34:20.712 --> 34:28.596
Christ’s work was very unique. The whole
thing was a very unique thing,

34:28.797 --> 34:35.932
was planned in such a manner that
He was to be born

34:36.133 --> 34:42.659
in a place which was very humble,
very humble place.

34:42.860 --> 34:48.706
Because He came to teach us humility.

34:48.906 --> 34:56.781
The word ‘teaching’ in English language
means telling about it, talking about it.

34:58.468 --> 35:08.565
But when I say ‘teach’ I mean create,
to activate this humility.

35:08.766 --> 35:15.554
Actually He came on this earth
first of all

35:17.515 --> 35:23.679
to create a space within us,
at the Agnya chakra,

35:24.996 --> 35:32.422
by removing the hurdles of the ego,
hurdles of the ego.

35:34.906 --> 35:39.022
He had to talk of humility that time,

35:39.222 --> 35:44.644
because Romans were ruling and they
were very arrogant,

35:44.844 --> 35:53.860
very crude, uncouth, underdeveloped,
we should say, not at all evolved.

35:54.082 --> 36:01.915
Like, you can say some of the animals,
which came into being

36:02.117 --> 36:07.243
and were thrown out of the evolutionary
process later on because they were useless,

36:07.444 --> 36:15.315
too aggressive or too big for their size
or some sort of a thing like that.

36:15.515 --> 36:18.718
In the same way Romans were.

36:20.062 --> 36:25.717
If you see their body, even now,
painted sometimes,

36:25.917 --> 36:29.882
you’ll find that it was not like
a human body, it was like

36:30.083 --> 36:33.636
some animals you see, the muscles
and all that was very grotesque.

36:33.836 --> 36:41.280
There was no softness, no roundishness,
on their faces.

36:41.612 --> 36:48.879
So, this ego of Romans affected everyone
whom they ruled

36:49.079 --> 36:54.593
because when you have somebody
as an ideal before you,

36:54.793 --> 37:02.569
and always people see who dominates them,
and then such a person becomes their ideal.

37:02.769 --> 37:09.134
So you start imbibing that kind
of a character within yourself.

37:09.335 --> 37:14.188
You see, somebody who is condescending,
you also become suddenly condescending.

37:14.388 --> 37:17.822
You see somebody who is very egoistical
and tries to show off,

37:18.023 --> 37:23.564
you also put up air. You can see this
everyday happening,

37:23.765 --> 37:31.351
that a boss comes in who is a very,
very airy person,

37:31.552 --> 37:34.832
everybody in the office is like that.

37:36.147 --> 37:39.358
And that’s how Romans affected the people
in those days

37:39.558 --> 37:42.362
by creating their own ideals, people
thought they are the ideals,

37:42.563 --> 37:50.515
they are the best, because they had
produced results according to them.

37:51.073 --> 37:55.144
They were so powerful, they thought
this was the power.

37:55.344 --> 38:00.915
And that’s why they followed their methods,
many people who were not even Romans.

38:01.115 --> 38:06.437
The another humbler group was
affected because

38:06.637 --> 38:10.208
they were hurt, their ego was hurt.

38:10.408 --> 38:14.507
So they became equally violent

38:14.708 --> 38:19.681
in the sense that they were so touchy
that you could not say anything to them,

38:19.882 --> 38:25.819
they would just come and bark on you,
frightened people.

38:27.546 --> 38:32.911
This kind of character is very dangerous
also,

38:33.173 --> 38:38.250
because that gives you some sort of very
bad diseases: can give you leprosy,

38:38.450 --> 38:41.242
people develop leprosy with that kind
of character,

38:41.442 --> 38:43.865
if you develop a barking temperament

38:44.065 --> 38:48.394
of a nature by which you just jump
at people.

38:48.594 --> 38:54.977
Nerves become absolutely
sort of shattered by it,

38:55.178 --> 39:00.617
and the leprosy is the disease
of the nerves.

39:00.817 --> 39:06.872
Those people who always keep themselves
under such strain

39:07.332 --> 39:10.020
and jump at every person who comes
along

39:10.220 --> 39:15.036
are very dangerously placed as far
as their nerves are concerned.

39:18.152 --> 39:23.802
And then a horrible type of virus
you know that which creates leprosy

39:24.003 --> 39:29.474
attacks these nerves, can attack because
they are very vulnerable,

39:29.675 --> 39:33.377
these kind of people who jump
on the others.

39:33.579 --> 39:36.415
That’s why there was so much leprosy,
in that small little place

39:36.616 --> 39:42.802
there were so many lepers, because
their nerves were shattered.

39:47.338 --> 39:50.403
In those circumstances Christ was born.

39:50.603 --> 39:54.257
But He was not only born just for Romans
or for anyone,

39:54.458 --> 39:57.233
but He was born for the whole world.

39:57.433 --> 40:02.765
Because ego had started growing in human
beings at that time

40:02.966 --> 40:08.270
and had developed quite a lot as far
as the Romans were concerned.

40:08.708 --> 40:14.602
And that demarcated the way human
beings were going on.

40:14.803 --> 40:21.272
So they had to be controlled first of all,

40:21.473 --> 40:25.170
and Christ had to come at a time where

40:25.371 --> 40:31.001
a balance between ego and superego
was to be established.

40:34.629 --> 40:36.926
So the first thing that was said
about Christ throughout

40:37.127 --> 40:43.880
in all these music and songs you have
heard now is that ‘Peace on Earth.’

40:46.739 --> 40:51.231
He came to create peace on earth.

40:52.910 --> 40:58.877
That’s only possible when you are
in balance, first of all,

40:59.077 --> 41:02.848
secondly when you are Realized.

41:03.049 --> 41:06.499
Both things should be there. If only you
get your Realization

41:06.700 --> 41:11.880
and there is no balance in you,
there cannot be peace.

41:12.466 --> 41:20.729
But peace never means in any way,
is a personality that recedes back,

41:20.929 --> 41:25.462
runs away from situations,
escapist,

41:25.662 --> 41:30.837
who does not want to face the reality -
never means that.

41:31.310 --> 41:38.552
Christ is pictured very differently
from what He was.

41:39.180 --> 41:42.430
He was the healthiest personality
you could think of,

41:42.633 --> 41:47.019
and the humblest man you could
think of.

41:47.220 --> 41:53.294
And He would not stand any nonsense,
nobody could take liberties with Him.

41:53.495 --> 41:57.930
But He would not Himself take liberties
with others, of course no question.

41:58.130 --> 42:04.638
Extremely compassionate, extremely
kind, but very powerful.

42:04.839 --> 42:07.950
This is the balance.

42:11.766 --> 42:15.929
So He came on this earth to create
peace within our minds.

42:16.130 --> 42:19.929
On this earth there is no peace, why?
What’s wrong?

42:20.130 --> 42:22.991
It’s only the human beings are not
peaceful.

42:23.192 --> 42:30.219
When this peace will be settled
within yourself? Who is violent?

42:30.420 --> 42:34.411
Human beings are violent to each other.

42:36.084 --> 42:40.687
Ego developed subtler ways and
subtler ways.

42:40.888 --> 42:48.144
Then, provocative ways started
coming up also from the superego,

42:48.345 --> 42:54.474
sly methods from the superego.
The conflict started.

42:56.178 --> 43:02.560
And at that time, to overcome
that conflict,

43:04.098 --> 43:09.123
the best thing was to create a space
in Agnya,

43:09.324 --> 43:13.442
in the center, in thoughtless awareness.

43:14.572 --> 43:18.669
That’s how Christ had to come
on this earth.

43:19.229 --> 43:25.138
The birth is very, very symbolic.

43:26.506 --> 43:35.163
Because He’s nothing but Chaitanya,
He’s nothing but the Word as you call it,

43:35.364 --> 43:40.607
Logos – I don’t know what all words
you have got in language,

43:40.807 --> 43:45.241
the Shabda, as they call it,
is the Aumkara –

43:45.441 --> 43:52.270
He was to be born in this way, because
He had no body,

43:57.388 --> 44:01.122
and the subtlest of subtle He had to be.

44:01.403 --> 44:09.796
Because the work was very subtle, Sukshma,
that’s why He was born like that.

44:10.036 --> 44:14.649
It’s very poetic to see Him lying down
in a manger, for people,

44:14.888 --> 44:24.005
that look at this: the King of Heaven
should…

44:25.271 --> 44:28.646
[Shri Mataji: It’s all right. Now she does
that to understand.

44:35.693 --> 44:39.318
(To the little girl who wants again
something:) Don’t go near that.]

44:45.918 --> 44:59.052
So the story of His birth was very
interesting tale.

45:01.568 --> 45:08.567
It was very symbolic that He came
in a humble place,

45:09.972 --> 45:13.194
because people were so proud
of their money,

45:13.395 --> 45:17.843
so arrogant because of their power
that they had.

45:18.043 --> 45:22.489
Even today all the Christian nations
are like that.

45:22.833 --> 45:27.004
Surprisingly, Christian nations should be
so arrogant

45:27.167 --> 45:35.286
and so power-drunk and think no end
of themselves because they are affluent.

45:37.112 --> 45:41.609
Think of the Christian nations being
very poor,

45:41.810 --> 45:45.614
do you think they would have had
racial problem?

45:48.597 --> 45:55.161
They don’t have racial problems
with Arabs. Not at all.

45:56.958 --> 46:01.335
As simple as that. No problem with Arabs.

46:01.517 --> 46:06.973
They have no race, Arabs have no race,
they have money, money race.

46:07.277 --> 46:12.574
Those people who hanker after money
are only bowing down to money.

46:12.894 --> 46:17.160
They have no respect for anything
else but for money.

46:21.280 --> 46:26.732
Those who have money and think
of money

46:26.933 --> 46:34.316
are another lot which is going to go out
of the circulation of evolution.

46:34.516 --> 46:37.941
They are going out already.

46:38.324 --> 46:42.623
The second lot is the one which was
like Romans.

46:42.824 --> 46:48.847
They had a fall, they were all finished
because they were power-drunk.

46:49.066 --> 46:57.659
They drank away, their civilization
completely finished off and they are out.

46:59.831 --> 47:03.209
You’ve seen Portugal, you’ll be amazed,
it’s happening there.

47:03.409 --> 47:07.611
The ego of Portuguese was so great,
you can’t believe

47:07.811 --> 47:12.358
that that country is a desolate country,
there’s nothing now,

47:12.559 --> 47:16.737
big-big, huge big buildings, which you see

47:16.937 --> 47:19.754
and you know they must have been rich
once upon a time.

47:19.954 --> 47:22.626
And there’s nothing left with them
except for their antique shops

47:22.827 --> 47:25.859
which are never open.

47:26.868 --> 47:34.066
This kind of a ego is again revived

47:36.003 --> 47:45.417
and that revival came up, imagine,
in the name of Christ. Imagine!

47:47.152 --> 47:52.253
They purchased people to be
converted as Christians.

47:52.646 --> 47:54.391
They gave them money,

47:54.591 --> 48:00.894
is all money, money propositions,
money enterprise going on.

48:03.253 --> 48:08.085
Jews the same, then the Christians
the same.

48:08.286 --> 48:11.975
He was born in a manger.

48:12.682 --> 48:23.277
For a little child to be put in a manger
by the Mahalakshmi, it’s too much.

48:23.683 --> 48:26.079
See how symbolic it is, Mahalakshmi,

48:26.279 --> 48:34.261
was not Lakshmi, but Mahalakshmi to put
the child in the manger.

48:35.644 --> 48:37.965
No place.

48:38.165 --> 48:46.099
We have at least Chelsham Road,
Warwick Road,

48:46.300 --> 48:53.363
Bramham Gardens, Brompton Square.

48:56.144 --> 48:59.935
But the child was born and was put
in the manger,

49:00.140 --> 49:04.800
the humblest thing in this world
is a manger.

49:06.430 --> 49:10.863
The humblest of all, a crib,

49:11.191 --> 49:15.626
the Highest is put in the manger.

49:19.753 --> 49:22.699
So, what do we do?

49:23.421 --> 49:25.599
We think we should also sleep in a manger,

49:25.800 --> 49:32.130
we’ll become like Christ. There are people
who believe in such nonsensical things.

49:32.331 --> 49:35.854
They think that, you see if they have
all the money,

49:36.055 --> 49:39.988
they drink and do all kinds of things,
you see -

49:40.296 --> 49:43.785
I met one man one day,

49:44.546 --> 49:48.988
he was all drunk lying near a church.

49:49.730 --> 49:52.398
He was saying: “I’m Christ, I’m Christ.”

49:52.598 --> 49:58.371
He must have had got this idea that
he’s lying there because he’s very humble.

49:58.845 --> 50:03.243
This kind of ridiculous caricature

50:03.444 --> 50:09.594
of the whole beautiful symbol is followed
everywhere.

50:14.894 --> 50:19.800
So the arrogant and the egoistical might
say that: “Why, if He was the King,

50:20.001 --> 50:25.775
why was He born in the manger?
Why was He kept in the manger?”.

50:25.976 --> 50:30.058
Everybody will have their own concept.

50:32.538 --> 50:38.153
Even there are people in India, who are
stupid people, not wise,

50:38.354 --> 50:44.035
who say that He must have done lots
of bad karmas to be born like that.

50:45.566 --> 50:54.029
Because to them, karmas give you more
money, I mean, God is not so unintelligent.

50:54.230 --> 51:00.847
If you do good karmas you become men
of God, you become seekers.

51:04.121 --> 51:08.996
You get the blessings of God by your good
karmas, you’ll become religious people,

51:09.196 --> 51:13.287
not moneyed people who can go to pubs
and waste their lives.

51:13.488 --> 51:18.884
This is the idea they have got that
by doing good karmas you become rich,

51:19.085 --> 51:25.972
and become even worse for next life.
Some people may believe like that.

51:27.512 --> 51:32.153
But He never did any karmas.
He was in akarma Himself,

51:32.354 --> 51:35.109
so no question of His punishment
and all that,

51:35.309 --> 51:39.560
because just a drama, but very
symbolic it is.

51:39.761 --> 51:46.226
Now see, a little child put in the manger,
no comfort.

51:46.503 --> 51:51.944
Can there be any comfort in a manger?
Think like that.

51:52.145 --> 51:56.792
All the Christian nations are after
their comforts.

51:59.305 --> 52:01.800
Aren’t we?

52:02.581 --> 52:07.855
What we think is not comfortable,
it should be comfortable.

52:08.076 --> 52:15.558
Christians should never seek comfort, that
is one of the messages of Christ’s birth.

52:18.594 --> 52:22.113
If they seek comfort then they are away
from Christ,

52:22.314 --> 52:26.066
because He was born in a manger.

52:26.626 --> 52:30.550
No comfort was provided for Him.

52:33.672 --> 52:38.891
But that doesn’t mean that you should
assume some sort of a funny habitation,

52:39.091 --> 52:43.302
it doesn’t mean that also, I mean I have
to tell the other side of it, you see.

52:43.503 --> 52:48.012
Copying Him is not the way, is not
the way by copying Him

52:48.213 --> 52:53.981
that you will become Christ, but
by imbibing His qualities within you.

52:54.182 --> 52:56.519
I’ve known people who live in a pigsty,

52:56.726 --> 53:02.146
but once they get to a better life
they want everything else.

53:03.883 --> 53:13.644
So imbibing the quality of humility
and adjustment.

53:19.628 --> 53:23.175
Humility and adjustment.

53:26.081 --> 53:29.970
Anywhere you are put, anytime.

53:30.171 --> 53:35.998
Very particular about time. If somebody
has to come at ten o’clock,

53:36.199 --> 53:39.435
and if he has to do a job, if it is
[that] he’s delayed by five minutes,

53:39.636 --> 53:45.464
he starts breaking all the heavens,
just can’t bear it,

53:46.606 --> 53:50.352
he can’t bear it, five minutes he has
to wait.

53:50.552 --> 53:54.456
And if he has to wait ten minutes,
he’s out for a pub, finished.

53:54.657 --> 53:59.787
He cannot be pacifying himself unless
and until he takes a drink.

53:59.988 --> 54:05.265
This is the situation of a volcanic
human mind.

54:09.178 --> 54:12.601
So the peace has to come.

54:16.406 --> 54:21.368
How? If you seek comfort you’ll become
lazy lumps.

54:21.569 --> 54:26.054
You’ll sleep off, you’ll be lotus-eaters.

54:27.152 --> 54:33.172
But if you not seek comfort, then
peace will come.

54:37.615 --> 54:40.924
Because for our own comfort, for our
selfish comfort

54:41.125 --> 54:44.185
of this body we torture everybody else.

54:44.385 --> 54:47.672
The other day only I was telling that
only in the Western countries it is so,

54:47.881 --> 54:50.359
not in India.

54:50.881 --> 54:53.178
If somebody’s sleeping even till twelve
o’clock

54:53.355 --> 54:58.483
you cannot wake up that person,
is a irreligious act.

54:58.684 --> 55:01.455
I mean in India anybody who sleeps
after six o’clock

55:01.656 --> 55:04.679
he’ll feel ashamed of himself to be
sleeping that time.

55:04.880 --> 55:06.836
He’ll be apologetic the whole day

55:07.036 --> 55:08.608
and he’ll say that, “Oh, God, I’m sorry
I slept.”

55:08.808 --> 55:14.844
It’s regarded as sinful to sleep so late
as six o’clock in the morning.

55:15.281 --> 55:18.812
I mean, any country like that.

55:25.274 --> 55:30.819
So comfort has no end. There’s no end
to it.

55:31.019 --> 55:37.141
Comfort crawls upon you, what is comfort?
Let us see, very simple.

55:37.342 --> 55:41.563
In Christ’s symbolic life, its very deep
significance is this:

55:41.764 --> 55:46.621
that comfort is nothing but the matter
overpowering the Spirit.

55:46.822 --> 55:49.503
Do you see that point?

55:49.703 --> 55:53.064
If you are sitting on a chair, then
you can’t sit on the ground.

55:53.264 --> 55:56.191
If you are sitting on a sofa set you
can’t sit on a chair.

55:56.391 --> 56:00.588
If you are sitting on a velvet, then you
cannot sit you know on an ordinary thing.

56:00.789 --> 56:04.767
Is the matter always overpowering
the Spirit and He was the Spirit,

56:04.968 --> 56:09.758
what does it matter to Him? Whether
straw or anything?

56:16.023 --> 56:21.051
It is insurmountable, nothing can
displease the Spirit

56:21.251 --> 56:26.414
of these material things, I mean the matter
otherwise will take over.

56:30.480 --> 56:34.551
That is the thing is, one has
to understand,

56:36.867 --> 56:39.416
that He was the Spirit and if you have
to become the Spirit,

56:39.617 --> 56:44.327
first of all, try to give up your comforts,
lash your bodies a little bit,

56:44.527 --> 56:47.096
I’m sorry on a Christmas day I have
to say that,

56:47.296 --> 56:49.804
because He was also lashed that way.

56:50.005 --> 56:54.705
If you see on the day He was born,
for a mother to put the child

56:54.906 --> 57:00.679
in a crip that was a manger is too much
of a sacrifice.

57:02.415 --> 57:04.587
How much you want to do for your
children, you see,

57:04.788 --> 57:08.744
dress them up properly, do this, do that.

57:08.945 --> 57:13.805
But the child was to be put in a manger,
was put in a manger,

57:14.005 --> 57:22.390
just for you people to learn that comfort
crawls on the Spirit.

57:25.250 --> 57:31.659
We always seek the comfort. This one
thing is the message to all of us.

57:31.860 --> 57:37.486
If you seek your room, “I must have
a bathroom attached to that.”

57:37.687 --> 57:43.992
Again comfort. “What about my wife,
where is she going to sleep?”

57:44.192 --> 57:51.484
She’ll sleep as others are sleeping.
And you’ll sleep as others are sleeping.

57:52.961 --> 57:57.812
Nobody is going to die of that be sure,
I can assure you.

57:58.013 --> 58:00.405
Sahaj Yoga is very hard thing that way
you see,

58:00.605 --> 58:04.461
very few people die once they come
to Sahaj Yoga.

58:06.144 --> 58:12.054
Some of them should. But they don’t.

58:12.617 --> 58:15.287
They continue, they go on giving
Realization,

58:15.487 --> 58:19.867
they go on doing everything, still
they continue.

58:21.588 --> 58:28.828
Escape all the accidents, escape
all the problems and they continue.

58:31.078 --> 58:35.586
But this is a short time which must
be used.

58:35.786 --> 58:39.992
It’s a very, very concrete thing I wanted
to tell you today.

58:40.192 --> 58:44.427
It’s nice to talk of Christ’s birth,
be happy about it, sing songs,

58:44.627 --> 58:47.833
go into a mood like that, but really
I tell you,

58:48.033 --> 58:59.172
it’s a very symbolic case for all of us
to know that He slept in a manger.

58:59.642 --> 59:05.578
And the another symbolicism is that,
what did we offer Him?

59:06.265 --> 59:10.186
What did this world offer Him at that time?

59:10.387 --> 59:16.408
The another symbolicism is that they
offered Him a manger.

59:18.875 --> 59:23.732
Are we going to do the same to our Mother?

59:29.793 --> 59:33.211
This is one thing one has to know.

59:35.312 --> 59:40.221
Manger is, after all, is all right,
it doesn’t catches anything,

59:40.422 --> 59:44.326
it has no left Nabhi, right Nabhi, nothing.

59:44.526 --> 59:48.859
It doesn’t have all these problems.
There are no thorns,

59:49.060 --> 59:55.928
there’s no Agnya, there’s nobody
screwing up into Your stomach,

59:56.129 --> 01:00:01.484
suddenly feel, “Oh God, don’t want
to see”.

01:00:02.191 --> 01:00:10.086
So you are the thistles in that manger
which have to be soft

01:00:10.398 --> 01:00:13.711
to give comfort to Christ.

01:00:14.063 --> 01:00:22.617
You have to become so soft and so sweet,
so clean and pure,

01:00:22.818 --> 01:00:29.031
because a new babe is going to be put
in the manger.

01:00:32.707 --> 01:00:36.913
You are the kushas, is the thistle.

01:00:37.788 --> 01:00:41.725
And for a yogi the kushasana is the one
who sits on the kusha only.

01:00:41.949 --> 01:00:44.527
So He was a yogi, He came on the kusha,
all right.

01:00:44.727 --> 01:00:52.629
But now, what about you? To receive
Him in the manger, this is the manger.

01:00:53.453 --> 01:00:57.014
The Mother is preparing the manger

01:00:57.215 --> 01:01:05.879
to make the child feel very happy
and comforted, the thistles.

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:16.455
Adamance, obstinacy, harshness, ugliness:

01:01:21.253 --> 01:01:24.812
all must be curbed down.

01:01:26.771 --> 01:01:31.024
It’s very symbolic, it’s very symbolic
I must say His birth;

01:01:31.224 --> 01:01:35.890
why, why, one should think, why was He
born like that?

01:01:38.242 --> 01:01:41.029
People might give any amount
of interpretations,

01:01:41.229 --> 01:01:44.742
but I know because I’ve done it.

01:01:47.102 --> 01:01:50.665
I’m trying to soften you, I’m trying
to mold you,

01:01:50.866 --> 01:01:54.000
sometimes I have to be harsh with you.

01:01:54.319 --> 01:02:00.184
Sometimes I have to be angry with you,
sometimes I have to tell you off.

01:02:00.384 --> 01:02:05.578
Just now there are some who are catching
so much on the Void,

01:02:05.779 --> 01:02:09.234
that My stomach is screwing up.

01:02:10.811 --> 01:02:14.502
It’s all right with Me, cause I’m supposed
to be that,

01:02:14.702 --> 01:02:18.133
I’m so fortunate that I have to face
all that.

01:02:18.333 --> 01:02:22.068
But what about Christ within us?

01:02:23.609 --> 01:02:28.559
You are not going to be happy
with yourself,

01:02:29.192 --> 01:02:32.164
with your being, with your Spirit,

01:02:32.364 --> 01:02:39.112
unless and until you create a manger
of very soft thistles.

01:02:43.535 --> 01:02:47.688
You yourself you are not going to enjoy.

01:02:47.912 --> 01:02:52.385
You think that by justifying your egos,
by justifying your arrogance,

01:02:52.585 --> 01:02:55.925
by justifying all that you are doing
to each other -

01:02:56.125 --> 01:03:00.096
some people are busy making money
out of Sahaj Yoga, some people are busy

01:03:00.297 --> 01:03:03.693
deceiving others, some are telling lies,
some are creating problems,

01:03:03.893 --> 01:03:06.791
some are beating wives and some wives
are provocating husbands,

01:03:06.992 --> 01:03:10.129
what is all this going on?

01:03:10.768 --> 01:03:15.140
We are creating a beautiful manger
for Christ,

01:03:16.768 --> 01:03:23.179
to create the peace on earth.
We have to be peaceful!

01:03:24.385 --> 01:03:32.126
To be peaceful one has to be humble,
this is the message of Christ, humble.

01:03:33.278 --> 01:03:37.773
If you become humble, peace will come.

01:03:38.110 --> 01:03:42.937
Humble is a good word, I don’t know
if it explains what it means.

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:51.023
Humble means: “Not asking for your
own comfort, but comfort of others”.

01:03:52.567 --> 01:03:56.273
When others are before you,

01:03:59.911 --> 01:04:04.231
that is humility. It’s not: “Thank you
very much.”

01:04:04.432 --> 01:04:08.994
You kill somebody and then tell to the dead
person: “I’m sorry I killed you” – finished.

01:04:09.195 --> 01:04:14.088
In English language is over. Once
you have said: “I’m sorry,” finished.

01:04:14.288 --> 01:04:20.343
“Yes, I know,” and the another is “I know.”
“Why did you do it?” “I know”. Finished.

01:04:20.544 --> 01:04:28.070
If he knows, then it’s all right.
Then there’s no punishment. No.

01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:33.617
You don’t know,

01:04:34.555 --> 01:04:38.976
you are all the Spirit, so beautiful.

01:04:39.827 --> 01:04:44.429
You are to be chiseled out, all right,
that’s My job.

01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:47.607
You are to be cleaned out, that’s My job,
all right.

01:04:47.807 --> 01:04:56.039
Kundalini awakening is My job, agreed,
but maintenance is yours.

01:04:58.323 --> 01:05:02.328
On the contrary sometimes I feel,

01:05:03.476 --> 01:05:08.015
because I do all this, the maintenance
is poor, very, very poor.

01:05:08.215 --> 01:05:13.672
Like in India I see some people try
to help us, by giving us money, you see.

01:05:13.872 --> 01:05:16.791
We didn’t earn the money ourselves,
you see, somebody donated money

01:05:16.992 --> 01:05:22.907
and they built some wells, all are
dilapidated and finished,

01:05:23.108 --> 01:05:29.498
free gift, nobody wants to look after it.
It’s human nature.

01:05:29.699 --> 01:05:33.353
If you don’t work hard for your
maintenance,

01:05:33.554 --> 01:05:35.776
and just leave it to Mother, “Oh,
She will cure us,

01:05:35.976 --> 01:05:40.159
let us continue what we want to do,
She’s coming after all,

01:05:40.359 --> 01:05:43.828
She’s going to look after us”,
we’ll lag behind.

01:05:44.028 --> 01:05:50.920
That’s why My presence can be sometimes
in a way not so fruitful.

01:05:51.121 --> 01:05:54.625
My presence in England

01:05:57.167 --> 01:06:00.500
is good up to a point,

01:06:01.225 --> 01:06:06.539
and afterwards it should not be there
for some time.

01:06:08.804 --> 01:06:11.465
I love you very much, you know that,
very much.

01:06:11.665 --> 01:06:15.410
I - England is My heart, and I have
to be here,

01:06:15.610 --> 01:06:19.863
and this Christmas I wanted to celebrate
with you and the New Year with you

01:06:20.063 --> 01:06:24.744
just out of My own desire. But I have
to make you understand

01:06:24.945 --> 01:06:32.601
that you have to work harder and harder
to keep yourself clean.

01:06:33.787 --> 01:06:40.280
Get rid of your problems, come up,
do not say that,

01:06:40.481 --> 01:06:44.970
“Yes, it is like this Mother.” All the time
you are reporting to Me,

01:06:45.171 --> 01:06:47.518
“Still Mother I’m catching, see now
this is happening,”

01:06:47.719 --> 01:06:51.672
as if it’s a boastful thing to say.

01:06:52.901 --> 01:06:56.875
“I will get all right, I have to be
all right,

01:06:57.075 --> 01:07:01.789
now Mother has gone, let Me show Her
when I come back”.

01:07:05.101 --> 01:07:08.149
When I once went to Bombay, Raulbai
did not come to see Me

01:07:08.349 --> 01:07:11.709
for seven days and she was in Bombay,
she had arrived to see Me.

01:07:11.914 --> 01:07:15.542
So I asked them, “What’s the matter,
is she keeping all right, is she all right?

01:07:15.742 --> 01:07:21.156
Then why didn’t she come to see Me?”
I was thinking what’s the matter with her.

01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:25.250
She came to see Me after seven days.
She said, “Mother, I’m sorry

01:07:25.451 --> 01:07:28.097
I didn’t come to see You because
I was caught up this time,

01:07:28.297 --> 01:07:32.398
I wanted to cleanse myself before showing
My face to You.”

01:07:37.619 --> 01:07:43.131
So, cleansing is to be done, maintenance
is to be done,

01:07:43.331 --> 01:07:50.351
raising of the Kundalini, collectivity,
collectivity:

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:53.588
look after each other, you have to only
support Sahaj Yogis

01:07:53.789 --> 01:07:57.671
and not others, outsiders, they are
outsiders, they are not us,

01:07:57.872 --> 01:08:00.608
we are Sahaj Yogis, and those who try
to support others

01:08:00.808 --> 01:08:06.495
are no more Sahaj Yogis, they get out
of Sahaj Yoga would be better for us.

01:08:06.696 --> 01:08:10.398
Whatever we are, we are among ourselves.

01:08:10.599 --> 01:08:13.417
Outsiders are outsiders, we have to love
each other,

01:08:13.617 --> 01:08:16.553
we have to respect each other as saints.

01:08:16.753 --> 01:08:20.956
Nobody has to say anything harsh things
to each other. No.

01:08:21.157 --> 01:08:24.867
Be kind, loving, affectionate.

01:08:25.703 --> 01:08:30.116
Curb down your tongues, be humble.

01:08:30.343 --> 01:08:36.091
Humility, humility is the thing one
has to be.

01:08:36.291 --> 01:08:42.094
Write it down with big words, be humble,
be humble, be humble.

01:08:44.937 --> 01:08:52.211
And when you become humble, such peace
will reign,

01:08:54.724 --> 01:08:59.115
and you will feel so nice, being humble,
there’s nothing wrong.

01:08:59.315 --> 01:09:01.337
Christ has gone to this extent to say

01:09:01.537 --> 01:09:06.248
that somebody slaps on this face you turn
the other. Be humble.

01:09:06.448 --> 01:09:10.258
With Romans there was no other way out.

01:09:15.564 --> 01:09:19.724
There was no other way out. Also,
He preached humility,

01:09:19.924 --> 01:09:23.836
throughout He preached humility.

01:09:24.036 --> 01:09:26.549
You be humble to each other, that’s all.

01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:29.187
You need not be humble to others, because

01:09:29.388 --> 01:09:33.183
no one can now torture the saints, is over,
that situation is over,

01:09:33.384 --> 01:09:36.484
but you be humble to each other.

01:09:39.648 --> 01:09:44.836
Humble in your demands of life.

01:09:45.066 --> 01:09:48.136
That doesn’t mean that you should
become people

01:09:48.337 --> 01:09:52.118
[Aside: Just keep it there.] Just that
you become people

01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:57.771
of a strange characters, you see,

01:09:57.972 --> 01:10:03.575
that doesn’t mean that, should be
decent, with decorum,

01:10:03.776 --> 01:10:11.429
as Christ was when He was born.
But you should be humble.

01:10:11.854 --> 01:10:15.744
Try to mould your bodies, make them
lighter

01:10:15.944 --> 01:10:19.393
in the sense that you can sit anywhere,
you can move anywhere,

01:10:19.594 --> 01:10:24.281
you can lie everywhere - you are all
young people,

01:10:25.186 --> 01:10:28.070
adjust yourself.

01:10:28.337 --> 01:10:30.212
If somebody has one room you should say,

01:10:30.422 --> 01:10:34.203
“All right, doesn’t matter, I can live
in the corridor, don’t worry.”

01:10:34.489 --> 01:10:37.380
But they will be first jumping,
I’ve seen that,

01:10:37.581 --> 01:10:41.575
to the room which has the attached bath.

01:10:41.808 --> 01:10:44.537
How many of you have rooms with
attached baths, let’s see?

01:10:44.737 --> 01:10:49.531
Raise the hands, living in the ashram.

01:10:51.926 --> 01:10:57.703
Better give up. Better give up.

01:10:58.158 --> 01:11:01.451
See now? Better give up.

01:11:01.652 --> 01:11:06.477
All of you give up your rooms and stay
in rooms which are shared.

01:11:06.678 --> 01:11:09.929
Now it’s all right for you not to share
because you are husband and wife,

01:11:10.129 --> 01:11:13.578
but need not ask for attached bath.

01:11:19.827 --> 01:11:22.727
Comforts are to be given up for others,
not for you.

01:11:22.927 --> 01:11:27.773
You should make others comfortable,
not yourself.

01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:35.777
Sometimes I’m surprised at human beings
how they allow others to eat anything,

01:11:35.977 --> 01:11:40.599
the way they are self-centered is
something surprising.

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:46.385
But after Sahaj Yoga you change!
You enjoy giving comfort to others,

01:11:46.586 --> 01:11:53.109
saying comforting words to others,
sweet things to others, you enjoy that!

01:11:53.454 --> 01:11:59.387
Christ was given the crib of a manger

01:11:59.587 --> 01:12:04.512
and He came to comfort you, to give
you peace

01:12:04.712 --> 01:12:11.096
and He came as a Saviour, can you
imagine the contrast?

01:12:11.296 --> 01:12:17.919
You are the saviours of the whole
universe now, as He was Saviour.

01:12:18.119 --> 01:12:24.649
But, you cannot be selfish, you cannot
be comfortable.

01:12:24.849 --> 01:12:27.338
You have to be like Christ, He used
to live wherever He liked:

01:12:27.538 --> 01:12:31.640
He lived in forest, He lived anywhere.

01:12:31.967 --> 01:12:38.969
Just working hard for people, He would
never even have His food sometimes.

01:12:41.129 --> 01:12:47.540
He lived under all circumstances,
under all conditions;

01:12:47.741 --> 01:12:52.312
He never asked for any comfort, nothing.

01:12:53.594 --> 01:12:57.677
He was a carpenter, He never even
used a glove.

01:12:57.877 --> 01:13:01.234
Here you must have gloves.

01:13:02.457 --> 01:13:06.473
You must have socks, you must have shoes,

01:13:06.673 --> 01:13:10.291
you must have a shaving this, He never
shaved even,

01:13:10.492 --> 01:13:14.062
that doesn’t mean you grow your beard.

01:13:19.561 --> 01:13:23.672
But He was a very clean person.

01:13:29.470 --> 01:13:35.398
He lived with the minimum of minimum, that’s
what one has to do, is to reduce things.

01:13:36.609 --> 01:13:39.116
You know, I have everything that one
can think of,

01:13:39.316 --> 01:13:44.523
but I can live with the minimum of minimum,
I can live with two saris,

01:13:44.752 --> 01:13:47.898
and sometimes with one.

01:13:49.281 --> 01:13:55.179
You should be able to live with minimum
of minimum, that’s the point is.

01:13:59.441 --> 01:14:03.578
And that is what one has to learn
from His life is

01:14:03.779 --> 01:14:07.565
that we are the saviours today,

01:14:07.766 --> 01:14:14.925
and Saviour lived just like a humble
person,

01:14:15.125 --> 01:14:20.588
very elite in His behavior, very dignified.

01:14:20.788 --> 01:14:23.248
He was not behaving like a beggar going,
“heh, heh, heh,” like that.

01:14:23.449 --> 01:14:26.337
some of them, you are like that also,
you see, you go about like this,

01:14:26.538 --> 01:14:31.422
when you talk, like this you go about,
that’s not the way!

01:14:31.623 --> 01:14:38.459
With dignity, with your magnificence,
with your gravity, move about.

01:14:38.659 --> 01:14:45.633
Actually those who are really great,
those who are the real emperors,

01:14:45.833 --> 01:14:50.159
do not need anything. Ah, what can
dominate them, tell Me?

01:14:50.359 --> 01:14:52.795
If you are the emperor of this world,

01:14:52.995 --> 01:14:55.235
if you know you are the queen
of this world,

01:14:55.436 --> 01:15:00.043
what is more important, what comfort
can dominate?

01:15:00.244 --> 01:15:06.389
What material thing can charm such
a person?

01:15:06.589 --> 01:15:11.305
Because that person is above, that’s
badshah, that’s the king,

01:15:11.505 --> 01:15:17.413
that’s the real sign of a king,
king of heaven,

01:15:17.614 --> 01:15:22.791
not of England, or of any place,
but of heaven.

01:15:22.992 --> 01:15:28.372
And that’s what you are, you are
the citizens of that kingdom,

01:15:28.572 --> 01:15:35.297
to you these things should be absolutely
useless.

01:15:37.693 --> 01:15:44.711
The beauty of the matter should be seen,
not the possession of it.

01:15:47.189 --> 01:15:49.605
Beauty is the comfort,

01:15:49.805 --> 01:15:53.466
not what you feel in the body, like
having comfortable things.

01:15:53.666 --> 01:15:58.304
Beauty is so comforting, people do not know

01:15:58.642 --> 01:16:01.890
how comforting is the beauty.

01:16:04.159 --> 01:16:09.274
And that I’m sure while we are celebrating
His birth today,

01:16:09.474 --> 01:16:19.426
we glorify Him, by accepting a kind
of a martyr Spirit,

01:16:19.627 --> 01:16:23.523
a Spirit in which you are dedicated,

01:16:24.164 --> 01:16:28.047
in which you do not demand anything,
but you give.

01:16:28.248 --> 01:16:31.226
You do not ask for anything, but you give.

01:16:31.427 --> 01:16:35.257
Even today I received letter from people
saying that:

01:16:35.458 --> 01:16:43.015
“Please, I want a job, can you help Me,
will You bring?”.

01:16:43.962 --> 01:16:49.922
All sort of things like that. It can be
any sort of a nonsense.

01:16:50.123 --> 01:16:52.638
Of course, I mean, one can have
all that kind of thing,

01:16:52.838 --> 01:16:58.394
but ask for one and that is the Spirit.

01:16:58.594 --> 01:17:01.867
And once you ask for that,

01:17:03.354 --> 01:17:08.224
nothing higher to what you’ve asked for.

01:17:08.425 --> 01:17:14.994
Then you don’t want anything else,
the enjoyment is complete.

01:17:15.195 --> 01:17:19.749
So to celebrate His birthday and to rejoice
in that,

01:17:19.949 --> 01:17:23.795
is to rejoice in our

01:17:26.017 --> 01:17:35.544
adequacies. If you are adequate you do not
hanker after your inadequacies, don’t you?

01:17:35.745 --> 01:17:39.859
If you are complete, if you are full,
if you are satisfied

01:17:40.059 --> 01:17:43.294
you do not hanker, do you?

01:17:43.887 --> 01:17:48.417
So enjoy your adequacies, your
completeness,

01:17:48.617 --> 01:17:58.872
your fullness, and your complete
satisfaction, enjoy that.

01:17:59.073 --> 01:18:02.476
Ultimately, all these things lead to some
sort of a satisfaction.

01:18:02.677 --> 01:18:06.084
Of course, I don’t know if you get
any satisfaction out of that,

01:18:06.284 --> 01:18:12.875
but the real satisfaction that is within
you is the Spirit, you enjoy that.

01:18:14.591 --> 01:18:20.488
This is for yourself, and for others
you are a comforter to others.

01:18:20.688 --> 01:18:24.359
It’s not that anybody who talks to you
will come and complain to Me:

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:27.888
“Mother, he has bitten me.

01:18:29.146 --> 01:18:35.622
I had a meeting with another scorpion,
he bit me.

01:18:37.715 --> 01:18:42.130
I touched somebody and he hit me.”

01:18:44.432 --> 01:18:48.480
Comfort. You are a thing of comfort
to others,

01:18:48.681 --> 01:18:54.800
believe Me, you are. Comfort others.

01:18:57.563 --> 01:19:04.075
So those who comfort others do not
bother about their comfort.

01:19:04.276 --> 01:19:10.036
The shepherds, simple people,

01:19:10.237 --> 01:19:17.044
in this cold, imagine they were outside,
and they saw the vision of the angel.

01:19:17.245 --> 01:19:21.788
It can only be seen by people who
are humble,

01:19:22.036 --> 01:19:25.583
who are leading a humble life,

01:19:25.971 --> 01:19:32.302
He appeared to them and the another
was, vision, to the Wise.

01:19:33.938 --> 01:19:36.821
So only the humble people and the wise
people -

01:19:37.021 --> 01:19:39.673
wisdom, common sense and wisdom.

01:19:39.873 --> 01:19:43.687
Those who are not wise can never
understand, can never understand,

01:19:43.887 --> 01:19:48.281
those who are intelligent and intellectuals
are not wise people at all,

01:19:48.482 --> 01:19:53.708
they are stupid, you know that they
are stupid people.

01:19:54.114 --> 01:20:01.345
Wisdom. So the three wise men and
the shepherd is another great symbolism,

01:20:01.545 --> 01:20:08.513
those who will understand Sahaja Yoga -
simple people, shepherds.

01:20:12.448 --> 01:20:15.958
And another are the wise.

01:20:17.755 --> 01:20:23.919
Only the wise can understand the star.

01:20:27.769 --> 01:20:31.021
So many must have seen the star.

01:20:32.697 --> 01:20:35.049
Wise men from the East. It’s true.

01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:39.294
Eastern people are much more wiser
than other people, no doubt about it.

01:20:39.494 --> 01:20:43.113
But why? Let’s see why they are wiser.

01:20:43.313 --> 01:20:49.997
Eastern are wiser, up to a point.

01:20:55.051 --> 01:21:00.044
In your body, there is East and West
if you see.

01:21:00.551 --> 01:21:09.029
East is left side and West is right side.

01:21:09.646 --> 01:21:18.607
Eastern are the left sided, nearer
the heart.

01:21:19.021 --> 01:21:22.781
But not the Eastern most are Japanese,
horrible people,

01:21:22.982 --> 01:21:29.156
Japanese, horrible, then the - all these
people who are selling you

01:21:29.357 --> 01:21:32.485
these drugs and all that, they are
worst of all.

01:21:32.685 --> 01:21:37.960
But those who know and are left-sided,

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:48.668
the combination of knowledge and love,
knowledge and compassion.

01:21:48.869 --> 01:21:52.902
If there is no love, if there is
no compassion,

01:21:53.102 --> 01:22:00.282
I mean you, just can’t talk to that
person. He’s like a stick!

01:22:00.482 --> 01:22:04.830
I mean, in a dried stick what vibrations
can I give, you just tell Me?

01:22:05.031 --> 01:22:10.185
A dried stick, straightforward dried stick,
you see.

01:22:10.590 --> 01:22:12.880
What vibrations I can give to a dried
stick?

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:23.174
There should be some sort of a greenery
in it, isn’t it? Little bit at least.

01:22:23.375 --> 01:22:28.092
If it is too much of water also it is
spoiled, can be rotten.

01:22:28.292 --> 01:22:35.672
But if it is a dry stick straightforward,
you know what I mean, dry sticks are -

01:22:35.839 --> 01:22:38.168
then how can you give vibrations
to such a person?

01:22:38.368 --> 01:22:40.568
You cannot. You cannot raise such a person.

01:22:40.769 --> 01:22:46.122
So, first thing is love, and wisdom
comes through love.

01:22:46.650 --> 01:22:52.529
Wisdom doesn’t come through intelligence,
it comes through love.

01:22:52.737 --> 01:22:59.226
When you love someone, you get the light
of wisdom.

01:22:59.427 --> 01:23:02.187
By thinking you can never become wise,
you can become stupid,

01:23:02.388 --> 01:23:09.386
absolutely stupid, but by loving you can
become very wise.

01:23:09.587 --> 01:23:12.960
Then I see Sahaj Yogis suddenly they
say some things extremely wise,

01:23:13.161 --> 01:23:17.396
something great, suddenly say something
that’s so sweet

01:23:17.597 --> 01:23:21.570
and so nice, I said: “That’s it, the heart
has opened out”.

01:23:21.771 --> 01:23:24.547
The fragrance of wisdom comes from
the heart

01:23:24.747 --> 01:23:28.915
and that is symbolic now, that three
of them came,

01:23:29.115 --> 01:23:33.396
and they were who? Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha.

01:23:36.645 --> 01:23:41.763
They came to see Christ – Brahma, Vishnu,
Mahesha.

01:23:45.869 --> 01:23:48.864
See the vibrations.

01:23:58.422 --> 01:24:02.325
Because They only can recognize,

01:24:05.411 --> 01:24:12.146
not ordinary people, Romans, no.

01:24:15.889 --> 01:24:18.802
So They came.

01:24:19.168 --> 01:24:24.036
So we have to be humble and we have
to be wise.

01:24:24.794 --> 01:24:31.005
Wisdom is such a, such a diamond,

01:24:31.206 --> 01:24:35.033
it has so many facets that I cannot
describe to you in a short time,

01:24:35.234 --> 01:24:38.349
one day I’ll talk about wisdom.

01:24:39.855 --> 01:24:44.832
But it’s all common sense, so sweet,
so beautiful,

01:24:45.032 --> 01:24:48.593
where to say what, how to change
the subject,

01:24:48.793 --> 01:24:56.808
where to assert more, where to handle
a situation in a strong way,

01:24:57.008 --> 01:25:05.763
is to, where to be a gentleman and where
to be uncouth,

01:25:06.835 --> 01:25:11.933
where to shout at people and where to be
quiet and humble and sweet.

01:25:12.134 --> 01:25:16.544
All such a judgment you see, is all
that is wisdom, you see.

01:25:16.934 --> 01:25:20.311
Is a center of gravity,

01:25:20.511 --> 01:25:23.870
and to achieve that you have to give up
your extreme behavior.

01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:31.216
Obstinacy is the first thing that should be
given up, for all wisdom, obstinacy.

01:25:39.737 --> 01:25:42.458
To have a son like Christ was such
a great boon

01:25:42.658 --> 01:25:49.851
I mean, so confident You know, feel,
“adhara”, the complete rapport is there,

01:25:50.052 --> 01:25:55.771
no problem of any kind, to have a son
like Him,

01:25:56.996 --> 01:26:02.154
completely obedient, absolutely 100%
obedience and humility

01:26:02.355 --> 01:26:07.305
and understanding of Your Being.

01:26:09.922 --> 01:26:13.052
No problems.

01:26:15.117 --> 01:26:19.311
You are all My sons too, and made
after Him,

01:26:19.512 --> 01:26:23.896
after the same pattern as I made Christ.

01:26:24.489 --> 01:26:29.232
I’m proud of you, you are My children,

01:26:29.844 --> 01:26:35.615
come up to it, and you have an example
already created for you.

01:26:37.796 --> 01:26:42.289
Before you is Christ, you see Him,
what a support it was,

01:26:42.490 --> 01:26:45.592
I never had any complaints of any kind,
no upset,

01:26:45.792 --> 01:26:49.812
He would never be upset, no question!

01:26:50.012 --> 01:26:51.450
He would never tell Me, “I’m upset,” never,

01:26:51.651 --> 01:26:58.802
this word doesn’t exist in the dictionary
of wise.

01:27:02.844 --> 01:27:08.474
You are never - how can you be upset,
when you are set once for all?

01:27:10.945 --> 01:27:14.547
This word must go from the dictionary
of many Sahaj Yogis who use it,

01:27:14.748 --> 01:27:17.979
problems and upset.

01:27:22.553 --> 01:27:26.323
You solve the problem, give the solutions.

01:27:26.524 --> 01:27:30.513
No problems, only solutions.

01:27:34.208 --> 01:27:37.724
That’s the way a son should be to a mother,

01:27:37.924 --> 01:27:43.701
that she can depend on him, absolutely,
no problems there, nothing,

01:27:43.901 --> 01:27:49.755
I mean, you have a son born like Christ,
what is there to worry about anything?

01:27:53.211 --> 01:28:02.325
Even the one word He said: “Behold
the Mother”, is a mantra,

01:28:02.526 --> 01:28:07.716
is the greatest mantra that I use.

01:28:08.524 --> 01:28:13.190
When your attention is here and there,
I just say that mantra to you,

01:28:13.390 --> 01:28:20.811
as a command it is! And so humble,
so confident: “Behold”.

01:28:21.011 --> 01:28:27.029
“Behold” doesn’t mean look, no, it’s a very
humble way of addressing,

01:28:27.229 --> 01:28:30.164
‘behold,’ it’s something glorious,
something great,

01:28:30.364 --> 01:28:34.703
behold it, accept it, understand.

01:28:34.903 --> 01:28:38.605
It was such a mutual understanding
of support and love

01:28:38.805 --> 01:28:41.919
that should exist between us.

01:28:42.636 --> 01:28:48.247
No secretiveness, no formalities,
no exclusiveness.

01:28:51.022 --> 01:28:53.820
No exclusiveness, all enjoyments must
be together.

01:28:54.021 --> 01:29:00.289
Now all your ideas of having separate
enjoyments

01:29:00.490 --> 01:29:04.206
must be given up for a change.

01:29:04.406 --> 01:29:12.212
Holiday is when you are in the company
of your, no more holidays, Sahaj Yogis.

01:29:12.413 --> 01:29:14.929
All these things must be given up.

01:29:15.129 --> 01:29:18.929
This is all against Christ’s behavior.

01:29:19.129 --> 01:29:23.482
He never had a holiday, never.

01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:30.052
This is holidaying.

01:29:33.522 --> 01:29:37.265
Holiday comes from the word holy day.

01:29:37.465 --> 01:29:41.574
Every day that is spent, every minute
that is spent

01:29:41.775 --> 01:29:46.929
in the company of Christ is a holy day.

01:29:49.785 --> 01:29:50.979
So they must have brought it down,

01:29:51.179 --> 01:30:00.226
Christ to Spirit and Spirit to spirits
and spirits to other things. I’m sure.

01:30:00.426 --> 01:30:07.853
I mean, that way, human beings are very
great at deriving at right points, you see,

01:30:08.053 --> 01:30:10.754
and jumping into ditches directly.

01:30:10.954 --> 01:30:15.378
So they must have done it so sweetly,
beautifully,

01:30:15.578 --> 01:30:24.761
that’s what it is wisdom, wisdom,
all the time, wisdom.

01:30:24.961 --> 01:30:31.734
Wise man is never cunning, never sharp.
Is something I cannot describe also.

01:30:31.934 --> 01:30:36.634
And who is the wisest of all is Shri
Ganesha, who is the embodiment of wisdom.

01:30:36.834 --> 01:30:39.571
Ask Him for wisdom.

01:30:39.772 --> 01:30:45.013
He gives you the wisdom to do anything,
ask Him for wisdom.

01:30:46.533 --> 01:30:50.998
Today I just think of how many Christmas
I must have passed,

01:30:51.199 --> 01:30:53.710
I’ve never talked about Christ so much,

01:30:53.911 --> 01:30:59.249
with that intimacy. Such a relationship,

01:30:59.450 --> 01:31:07.813
such a relationship of, so near and
so far - because He knew who I was.

01:31:09.508 --> 01:31:14.920
That awe, that respect, that humility,

01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:20.671
is hard to find in any disciple, even
in a disciple, in your own son!

01:31:20.872 --> 01:31:25.536
Is so close, but complete understanding.

01:31:29.075 --> 01:31:34.626
That oneness has to be developed.

01:31:34.826 --> 01:31:38.366
Gradually we are all developing it, I know,

01:31:38.566 --> 01:31:42.151
but these are the days of speed and
we have to speed up a little more

01:31:42.351 --> 01:31:45.302
in the right direction.

01:31:46.482 --> 01:31:52.763
So now, as desired by you, we have
a white Christmas outside.

01:31:52.964 --> 01:31:54.546
[Some yogis say: “Jai Shri Mataji”].

01:31:54.747 --> 01:32:02.763
Then as you have desired that “Wash me
and I shall be whiter than snow”

01:32:03.979 --> 01:32:06.958
is been blessed,

01:32:09.190 --> 01:32:13.815
think of all the nice things we have
done together

01:32:14.016 --> 01:32:18.734
and that we are going together to do it
later on:

01:32:18.935 --> 01:32:22.467
that’s how you solve your past and future
problem.

01:32:22.668 --> 01:32:28.911
And Christ came on this Earth to expand
your present.

01:32:29.145 --> 01:32:33.292
So Christ who is the present Christ,

01:32:34.177 --> 01:32:40.817
today, who is born in you, is to be
looked after.

01:32:41.526 --> 01:32:46.672
He’s not the Christ of the Bible, but
the Christ of your heart,

01:32:46.873 --> 01:32:51.396
which is born within you is to be
looked after.

01:32:54.550 --> 01:33:00.309
Bible is so symbolic that it will take
years and years

01:33:00.510 --> 01:33:05.053
for people to understand it,
it’s too symbolic.

01:33:05.253 --> 01:33:13.482
But at least you can understand it, but
other human beings cannot understand.

01:33:14.717 --> 01:33:18.023
So one has to only understand through
your own Spirit,

01:33:18.224 --> 01:33:23.666
that is the Christ born within you, which
must be looked after.

01:33:23.866 --> 01:33:29.083
Put Him in a very soft heart, if you
have thistles,

01:33:30.443 --> 01:33:33.224
He’s a collective being.

01:33:33.424 --> 01:33:41.771
If you affect the collectivity,
then He’s affected. Look after Him.

01:33:46.331 --> 01:33:51.281
So they say Merry Christmas is enjoyment
for joy.

01:33:51.482 --> 01:33:56.661
Out of peace comes the joy, light of joy,
happiness.

01:33:56.861 --> 01:34:02.171
I wish peace for the whole world,
for the whole nations,

01:34:02.372 --> 01:34:06.610
to understand to give up all the strives,

01:34:06.810 --> 01:34:13.388
all the false battles, for money and
for power,

01:34:14.165 --> 01:34:19.505
all wrong ideas that they are different
from each other,

01:34:19.706 --> 01:34:25.202
and come under the banner of Sahaja Yoga

01:34:25.402 --> 01:34:30.107
and enter into the Kingdom of God,

01:34:30.872 --> 01:34:35.854
where they are invited with all respect
and love.

01:34:36.054 --> 01:34:39.980
I wish peace to all of them, to all
the countries,

01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:49.318
all the human beings, in their families,
in their hearts, with their children.

01:34:51.272 --> 01:34:59.835
With all of them, let there be peace,
let their heart emit peace,

01:35:00.036 --> 01:35:09.763
their tongues speak with peace,
their eyes see nothing but peace.

01:35:13.883 --> 01:35:19.024
All this has to change, tremendous change
has to take place,

01:35:19.224 --> 01:35:22.828
the whole universe has to take
a different turn.

01:35:23.028 --> 01:35:28.498
All that is hatred, hateful, ugly,
has to vanish,

01:35:28.698 --> 01:35:32.843
and the peace has to prevail, which is
not the peace of the dead

01:35:33.044 --> 01:35:38.513
but peace of the living, that has to come,
of the wise.

01:35:39.234 --> 01:35:43.419
I bless all of you to be the channels
of that peace,

01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:49.944
to be beautiful channels of that peace,
to be glorious channels of that peace,

01:35:50.144 --> 01:35:56.729
to be great children of your Mother,
who is so proud of you.

01:35:56.930 --> 01:35:59.927
May God bless you.

01:37:22.042 --> 01:37:23.739
There’s a mantra for the Goddess:

01:37:23.939 --> 01:37:28.453
"Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu,
shanti rupena samsthita":

01:37:28.654 --> 01:37:35.296
Oh Goddess who resides through all
this creation created,

01:37:35.497 --> 01:37:39.995
all that is created, as peace.

01:37:40.838 --> 01:37:47.109
So you have to seek peace that is
your Mother.
