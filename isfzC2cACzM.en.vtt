00:03:45.872 --> 00:03:56.593
Today we have assembled here to celebrate the Sahasrara Day

00:03:56.858 --> 00:04:04.667
which was opened in 1970 on this date.

00:04:04.827 --> 00:04:20.159
I find this beautiful canopy is like our Sahasrara,

00:04:22.299 --> 00:04:25.939
and so very apt

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:33.958
to have this beautiful arrangement for Sahasrara Day.

00:04:38.359 --> 00:04:46.239
We have to understand what happens when the Sahasrara opens.

00:04:47.331 --> 00:04:53.759
When the Kundalini passes through the five centers,

00:04:53.958 --> 00:05:00.879
it enters into the area which we call as limbic area.

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:08.798
This area is all surrounded by thousand nerves.

00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.999
And when these nerves get enlightened,

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:20.419
they look like flames of vibgyor colors, seven colors,

00:05:20.579 --> 00:05:33.929
and very mildly, beautifully shining, emitting peace.

00:05:36.178 --> 00:05:44.059
But when the Kundalini starts emitting its vibration

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:49.368
on the sides,

00:05:59.743 --> 00:06:07.107
all these nerves get enlightened gradually

00:06:07.267 --> 00:06:17.890
and start moving on all directions, opening the Sahasrara.

00:06:18.731 --> 00:06:23.125
And then the Kundalini

00:06:28.655 --> 00:06:42.273
emerges out through the fontanel bone area

00:06:42.433 --> 00:06:46.747
which we call as Brahmarandhra.

00:06:46.907 --> 00:06:49.859
Randhra means "the hole"

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:58.028
and the Brahma is the all-pervading Power of God's love.

00:06:58.188 --> 00:07:09.442
So it enters into the subtle energy which is all-pervading

00:07:09.602 --> 00:07:13.002
which we do not feel normally.

00:07:13.503 --> 00:07:22.520
But then the Chaitanya, the vibrations

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:36.874
which are the part and parcel of this energy, all-pervading Power,

00:07:37.034 --> 00:07:41.728
the Paramachaitanya,

00:07:41.888 --> 00:07:49.211
they start entering into our brain;

00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:58.002
and showering their blessings, in the limbic area they assemble.

00:08:00.158 --> 00:08:07.889
Now the limbic area is connected to all the area of the brain

00:08:08.049 --> 00:08:12.840
and also to the nerves.

00:08:14.162 --> 00:08:20.442
So it starts flowing onto the nerves,

00:08:20.602 --> 00:08:26.451
giving you the new awareness of collective consciousness

00:08:26.611 --> 00:08:29.562
called as samuhik chetana.

00:08:29.722 --> 00:08:34.520
So you get a new chetana, a new awareness

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:45.601
which is showered upon your limbic area.

00:08:47.064 --> 00:08:55.864
The working of these Chaitanya waves is very interesting.

00:08:56.024 --> 00:09:05.520
They are normally formed like small commas,

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:12.241
but then they go into different forms.

00:09:12.401 --> 00:09:17.201
They make themselves into swastikas,

00:09:17.361 --> 00:09:25.121
as the four-limbed symbol of innocence.

00:09:27.201 --> 00:09:35.489
Or they become the Aumkara, as you know how Aum is written,

00:09:35.649 --> 00:09:47.329
which is the symbol of our doing, our awareness.

00:09:47.961 --> 00:10:01.186
So when they form the swastika they try to nourish the left side,

00:10:01.346 --> 00:10:05.738
and when they form the Aumkara they nourish the right side.

00:10:05.898 --> 00:10:11.499
Left and right sympathetic nervous system they nourish.

00:10:13.401 --> 00:10:21.281
But Sahasrara is to be kept open

00:10:21.441 --> 00:10:25.520
it's rather difficult for people

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.775
because it's a vicious circle.

00:10:28.935 --> 00:10:34.281
First these vibrations should enter into your brain

00:10:34.441 --> 00:10:39.570
through the Brahmarandhra when it is opened out,

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:44.115
and they should nourish your nerves

00:10:44.275 --> 00:10:50.225
by which your left and right side open out;

00:10:50.385 --> 00:10:58.755
and so more Chaitanya can flow down all these centers.

00:10:58.915 --> 00:11:06.646
But if your Sahasrara is not properly opened,

00:11:06.806 --> 00:11:11.334
this process doesn't take place.

00:11:11.494 --> 00:11:17.787
As a result of that, the chakras don't open,

00:11:17.947 --> 00:11:31.975
the Kundalini only as very few strands is kept in the spinal cord,

00:11:32.135 --> 00:11:43.478
and the new strands cannot rise because your chakras are not open.

00:11:43.638 --> 00:11:52.321
So in Sahaja Yoga it is very important to keep your Sahasrara open,

00:11:52.481 --> 00:11:56.760
otherwise there's a vicious circle.

00:11:57.744 --> 00:12:02.355
To keep the Sahasrara open is in a way very easy,

00:12:02.515 --> 00:12:05.811
as well as difficult.

00:12:05.971 --> 00:12:09.238
As you have known in the Devi Mahatmyam

00:12:09.398 --> 00:12:16.673
that at Sahasrara, Mahamaya comes.

00:12:16.833 --> 00:12:22.057
She is a Mahamaya: not easy to recognize Her,

00:12:22.217 --> 00:12:24.895
not easy to know Her.

00:12:25.055 --> 00:12:27.867
She lives just like you,

00:12:28.027 --> 00:12:31.243
She moves just like you,

00:12:31.403 --> 00:12:38.521
and you can never make out Her real nature.

00:12:38.681 --> 00:12:42.660
She is in the form of Mahamaya.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:54.282
So at the Sahasrara, to recognize the Mahamaya is another vicious circle.

00:12:54.442 --> 00:12:56.962
You may say that why should it be Mahamaya?

00:12:57.122 --> 00:13:02.570
should have been better as starkingly some other form.

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:06.377
But any other form could not have worked out Sahaja Yoga

00:13:06.537 --> 00:13:10.531
in modern times;

00:13:10.691 --> 00:13:16.808
because people would have been frightened and upset

00:13:16.968 --> 00:13:20.247
and they would never have taken to Sahaja Yoga,

00:13:20.407 --> 00:13:22.839
because they had no discretion already

00:13:22.999 --> 00:13:26.440
within them to know what is right, what is wrong.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:33.148
That is why it had to be in the Mahamaya form.

00:13:33.308 --> 00:13:38.792
In the Mahamaya form you have to recognize.

00:13:38.952 --> 00:13:43.576
This is another test because Mahamaya you cannot recognize,

00:13:43.736 --> 00:13:47.270
while you have to recognize.

00:13:48.821 --> 00:13:54.259
But in Sahaja Yoga you have seen so many photographs

00:13:54.419 --> 00:13:58.852
which should convince you people mentally

00:13:59.012 --> 00:14:02.943
about this Mahamaya swarupa.

00:14:03.103 --> 00:14:08.925
You can see mentally, you can understand there's something very different.

00:14:09.085 --> 00:14:12.477
Even when I came to Napoli,

00:14:12.637 --> 00:14:16.673
the policeman and everybody was given a photograph

00:14:16.833 --> 00:14:19.991
and they all recognized that there is something very different,

00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:24.395
they all wanted to shake hands with Me.

00:14:24.555 --> 00:14:27.383
This is one way.

00:14:27.675 --> 00:14:32.356
Another way is that you start seeing the blessings,

00:14:32.516 --> 00:14:38.085
and you start seeing how you become so progressively

00:14:38.245 --> 00:14:43.725
better materially, physically, emotionally, and spiritually.

00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:50.646
Still on a mental level most of the people recognize.

00:14:50.806 --> 00:15:01.765
But unless and until it is recognized in the heart,

00:15:02.878 --> 00:15:07.205
it's no recognition.

00:15:08.285 --> 00:15:22.445
Already the heart is surrounded by seven auras of the seven chakras.

00:15:24.605 --> 00:15:29.764
And the spirit, the Atma, resides in the heart.

00:15:32.105 --> 00:15:36.125
As it is, on top of your head here

00:15:36.285 --> 00:15:41.486
resides the God Almighty, Sadashiva.

00:15:41.646 --> 00:15:47.225
So when Kundalini touches that point

00:15:47.385 --> 00:15:50.303
your spirit gets awakened

00:15:50.463 --> 00:15:55.742
and the light of the spirit starts spreading,

00:15:57.743 --> 00:16:03.712
and it starts acting on your central nervous system;

00:16:03.872 --> 00:16:09.600
because automatically the vibrations,

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:14.479
the Chaitanya flow into your brain

00:16:14.639 --> 00:16:19.254
who enlighten your nerves.

00:16:20.478 --> 00:16:30.685
But still the recognition on the heart is not there.

00:16:30.845 --> 00:16:36.287
Even without that you start feeling the cool breeze,

00:16:36.447 --> 00:16:39.425
you can raise the kundalini of others

00:16:39.585 --> 00:16:42.953
you can cure people,

00:16:43.113 --> 00:16:46.148
you can do many things,

00:16:46.308 --> 00:16:53.748
but still it is not yet felt in the heart so much.

00:16:56.309 --> 00:17:01.845
That's why we have music, art

00:17:02.005 --> 00:17:11.974
all these things start opening your heart.

00:17:12.134 --> 00:17:14.173
But still it is not recognition,

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:20.722
because recognition is a mental activity of the heart.

00:17:20.882 --> 00:17:25.300
How can heart have a mental activity?

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:31.728
This is another problem you all can face, and I know that

00:17:31.888 --> 00:17:37.075
that recognition, if it is a mental activity of the heart,

00:17:37.235 --> 00:17:39.995
how do we do it?

00:17:41.365 --> 00:17:46.528
Say, if you are a Christian born in a Christian family,

00:17:46.688 --> 00:17:49.563
as soon as you see the photograph of Christ,

00:17:49.723 --> 00:17:54.218
immediately you feel it is Christ, you see - something here.

00:17:54.378 --> 00:17:58.207
Or if you are a Hindu, if you see the photograph of Shri Rama,

00:17:58.367 --> 00:18:01.808
immediately you know it's Shri Ram, you see - there's a kind of a thing,

00:18:01.968 --> 00:18:06.168
recognition in the heart.

00:18:08.328 --> 00:18:13.082
But the recognition of somebody living with you

00:18:13.242 --> 00:18:15.995
is very, very difficult,

00:18:16.155 --> 00:18:24.315
and you live on the cusp of your mental activities only.

00:18:24.475 --> 00:18:29.262
But to go deep down into your heart,

00:18:29.422 --> 00:18:33.688
"What should we do?" people tell Me.

00:18:33.848 --> 00:18:40.250
"Mother, how should we get into our heart?

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:48.171
How this mental activity can be performed through the heart?"

00:18:48.331 --> 00:18:55.491
Now you must remember that heart is absolutely connected with brain,

00:18:57.209 --> 00:19:00.338
absolutely connected.

00:19:01.586 --> 00:19:07.708
It's not disconnected thing if it was, it would not have worked out.

00:19:08.635 --> 00:19:16.105
When heart fails, after some time brain also fails;

00:19:16.265 --> 00:19:21.637
the whole body goes out of order.

00:20:04.071 --> 00:20:15.105
So this mental activity of the heart is to be understood this way,

00:20:17.585 --> 00:20:22.253
that as soon as you see the danger,

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:26.802
without even thinking, in a reflex way

00:20:26.962 --> 00:20:33.524
your heart starts pumping more blood and you get palpitation.

00:20:37.065 --> 00:20:39.595
You don't have to think, there's no mental activity;

00:20:39.755 --> 00:20:42.365
just you see supposing a tiger standing before you,

00:20:42.525 --> 00:20:46.185
immediately the heart will start pumping.

00:20:46.345 --> 00:20:50.193
It's a reflex action.

00:20:51.904 --> 00:20:56.547
Now how this activity takes place, one may say,

00:20:56.707 --> 00:20:59.955
is that because it is built in within you

00:21:00.115 --> 00:21:03.483
that as soon as you see some emergency

00:21:03.643 --> 00:21:09.228
your sympathetic nervous system goes into activity,

00:21:09.722 --> 00:21:12.701
and you start feeling the fear,

00:21:12.861 --> 00:21:18.222
you start feeling that there should be some protection,

00:21:18.382 --> 00:21:21.222
that you should do something about it.

00:21:21.382 --> 00:21:24.951
But you do not think, you just run,

00:21:25.111 --> 00:21:27.622
you run as fast as possible.

00:21:27.782 --> 00:21:29.184
You don't think about it

00:21:29.344 --> 00:21:31.428
"what I should do, where I should run?"

00:21:31.588 --> 00:21:38.180
just you go on running away from the danger.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.707
And how do you do that?

00:21:40.867 --> 00:21:46.826
Because it is built in within you, all this, in your brain

00:21:46.986 --> 00:21:53.177
that as soon as the heart starts pumping too much blood,

00:21:53.337 --> 00:21:59.954
it should just make the legs work and the hands work and you should run.

00:22:00.114 --> 00:22:05.301
Or we can say it is in the central nervous system built in,

00:22:05.461 --> 00:22:07.781
the fear.

00:22:10.195 --> 00:22:16.463
Any reaction, any response like that is built in within you.

00:22:17.423 --> 00:22:25.382
But the response to the spirituality is not yet manifested.

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:34.986
It is manifested. It is all built, no doubt,

00:22:35.146 --> 00:22:39.745
but it is not yet manifested.

00:22:40.618 --> 00:22:44.689
And how will it manifest?

00:22:44.849 --> 00:22:50.360
That's what people ask Me, "Mother, how will it manifest?"

00:22:51.253 --> 00:22:57.528
Through your past

00:22:57.688 --> 00:23:00.328
you have learnt that you have to be afraid of this,

00:23:00.488 --> 00:23:02.528
you have to be afraid of that.

00:23:02.688 --> 00:23:05.787
Also in this lifetime you have learnt many things.

00:23:05.947 --> 00:23:09.627
For a child may put his hand to the candle, won't feel, be frightened;

00:23:09.787 --> 00:23:14.041
but a grown-up would, because of an experience.

00:23:14.201 --> 00:23:18.328
With the experience gradually you built in

00:23:18.488 --> 00:23:26.127
that reaction of reflex within you, so that you'll try to save yourself.

00:23:27.344 --> 00:23:32.460
Now what experience you should have

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:38.133
to build that in your heart, is the point.

00:23:39.139 --> 00:23:47.696
And the experience is of your own divinity,

00:23:47.856 --> 00:23:54.841
of your own spirituality.

00:23:57.136 --> 00:24:04.859
Once you start developing that experience,

00:24:05.019 --> 00:24:09.697
then you know that you are a divine person.

00:24:09.857 --> 00:24:18.132
Unless and until you are aware fully that you are a divine person,

00:24:18.292 --> 00:24:25.092
howsoever faith you may have in Me, the recognition is not complete

00:24:25.378 --> 00:24:29.299
because who is recognizing Me is a blind person.

00:24:29.459 --> 00:24:32.889
If a blind person is recognizing Me,

00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:37.870
it won't have that response of the heart.

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:43.122
So first you have to recognize yourself to be a divine person,

00:24:43.282 --> 00:24:46.841
to have faith in yourself.

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:52.101
We do not have faith in ourselves, though we are Sahaja Yogis

00:24:52.261 --> 00:24:57.020
If there’s any problem, they will write a letter to Me.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:01.542
If they are sick they’ll write a letter to Me.

00:25:01.702 --> 00:25:07.260
If there’s any family questioning they’ll write to Me

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:13.888
If there’s somebody bothering them with some questions they’ll ask Me.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.598
But if you become introspective and meditative

00:25:21.758 --> 00:25:25.065
then you touch that divinity within you.

00:25:25.225 --> 00:25:30.779
When you touch that divinity you know you are a divine person.

00:25:30.939 --> 00:25:33.319
So, in Sahastrara Puja, actually,

00:25:33.479 --> 00:25:38.562
you have to recognise your own divinity, that you are divine,

00:25:38.722 --> 00:25:42.067
by experiencing your divinity.

00:25:42.227 --> 00:25:47.034
How do you experience your divinity?

00:25:48.177 --> 00:25:54.642
That you give realisation to others.

00:25:54.802 --> 00:26:00.055
It’s a great experience to give realisation to others.

00:26:00.215 --> 00:26:03.288
Not only that, you give realisation

00:26:03.448 --> 00:26:06.719
but you can tell about their chakras,

00:26:06.879 --> 00:26:09.524
you know what’s wrong with them

00:26:09.684 --> 00:26:15.864
you are quite confident. And mentally you know

00:26:16.024 --> 00:26:20.229
that, “Yes, yes, it’s working” you’ll say,

00:26:20.389 --> 00:26:23.613
without getting involved into it as “I do it!” You’ll say,

00:26:23.773 --> 00:26:29.338
“Mother, it’s working. It’s happening. It’s this thing, that thing.”

00:26:29.498 --> 00:26:37.945
But you never introspect, “How is it I am working?

00:26:39.175 --> 00:26:43.737
How I’m working it out?

00:26:43.897 --> 00:26:47.177
How I can feel it?

00:26:47.337 --> 00:26:51.680
What has happened to me?

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:55.057
What has improved in me?

00:26:55.217 --> 00:26:58.057
What has sharpened in me?

00:26:58.217 --> 00:27:02.496
What is the development in me?

00:27:02.656 --> 00:27:07.229
What is the transformation?”

00:27:09.729 --> 00:27:12.988
Once you start thinking about it

00:27:13.148 --> 00:27:22.828
the experience of your own being, then a kind of a feeling

00:27:22.988 --> 00:27:26.847
feeling – toward the Mahamaya, develops.

00:27:27.007 --> 00:27:29.818
Feeling. Again, I say ‘feeling’.

00:27:29.978 --> 00:27:36.133
Like feeling of fear, feeling of happiness, feeling of depression.

00:27:36.293 --> 00:27:42.876
Any feeling you develop. And this feeling,

00:27:43.036 --> 00:27:49.566
you could call a feeling of gratitude, feeling of love,

00:27:49.726 --> 00:27:55.966
feeling of oneness, feeling of joy.

00:27:56.126 --> 00:28:01.765
All this starts working in your heart

00:28:01.925 --> 00:28:12.908
and then you feel the responses.

00:28:14.424 --> 00:28:20.369
If, supposing, the sea is responding to moon

00:28:20.529 --> 00:28:24.594
that means it has that mobility in it to respond.

00:28:24.754 --> 00:28:28.129
A stone will not react to the moon.

00:28:28.289 --> 00:28:30.564
In the same way: in your heart

00:28:30.724 --> 00:28:34.932
these waves of these feelings are created

00:28:35.092 --> 00:28:38.111
by the experience of spirituality,

00:28:38.271 --> 00:28:44.379
by the experience of your own being.

00:28:44.539 --> 00:28:49.380
And then you start expressing them.

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:56.939
And I could make it out. Such a person may not be so much talkative,

00:28:57.099 --> 00:29:02.707
may not know much about Sahaja Yoga, but in the heart,

00:29:02.867 --> 00:29:08.612
in the heart he feels a response.

00:29:08.772 --> 00:29:15.856
Is something to be achieved because you know

00:29:16.016 --> 00:29:20.314
that the center of heart is placed here.

00:29:20.474 --> 00:29:25.849
The peetha, the seat, of the Heart, is on Brahmarandhra.

00:29:26.009 --> 00:29:29.857
If your heart is not open,

00:29:30.017 --> 00:29:37.156
in the heart if you do not have those responses built-in,

00:29:39.576 --> 00:29:43.590
they need not be of awe or fear.

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:49.171
But a natural protocol that develops.

00:29:49.331 --> 00:29:52.211
Then you can never do wrong

00:29:52.371 --> 00:29:58.201
because you know what ever is good in your heart.

00:29:58.361 --> 00:30:00.639
Supposing you love somebody from your heart

00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:05.028
you are not going to harm that person.

00:30:05.188 --> 00:30:09.867
In the same way, when you start feeling those responses

00:30:10.027 --> 00:30:11.627
in your heart,

00:30:11.787 --> 00:30:13.918
you can never do wrong because

00:30:14.078 --> 00:30:17.367
they are now manifesting which were built within you.

00:30:17.527 --> 00:30:21.758
Because there was spirituality, there was that divinity

00:30:21.918 --> 00:30:27.733
which was built in. Now it is manifesting.

00:30:27.893 --> 00:30:32.581
And then you do not worry about things

00:30:32.741 --> 00:30:37.068
and you do not do anything outwardly.

00:30:37.228 --> 00:30:43.894
It is said in Upanishads like Shandilya Upanishad, Kathopanishad

00:30:44.054 --> 00:30:48.023
that once you know the Brahma,

00:30:48.183 --> 00:30:52.303
then all the outside things like wearing a thread of Yagyopaveeta

00:30:52.463 --> 00:30:57.615
and all that, should be thrown away – it’s not necessary –

00:30:57.775 --> 00:31:01.634
because now you got the sutra (thread) within yourself.

00:31:01.794 --> 00:31:05.751
Then you should give up all those outward things

00:31:05.911 --> 00:31:11.177
because inside is all built-in now, is expressing itself.

00:31:11.337 --> 00:31:14.029
And such a person automatically

00:31:14.189 --> 00:31:20.535
becomes a yogi of very high caliber.

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:26.376
There was one gentleman in Calcutta, His name is Mr. Khan,

00:31:26.536 --> 00:31:32.724
though he is a Hindu gentleman and a great scientist of physics.

00:31:33.494 --> 00:31:39.859
He was developing those feelings

00:31:40.874 --> 00:31:47.373
and one day he was taking his bath in a bathtub and fell down

00:31:47.533 --> 00:31:53.868
on his back. And it completely broke and some of the splinters

00:31:54.028 --> 00:32:00.054
went into the brain and he was in complete coma.

00:32:00.214 --> 00:32:06.670
So much so that doctors gave up complete hope about him, saying that,

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:13.455
“He can never come back to life.” And he was in the intensive care.

00:32:13.615 --> 00:32:21.662
But just before falling he called – responses – “Ma!” That’s all.

00:32:21.822 --> 00:32:26.318
Then I was in Delhi. They informed Me that he has fallen

00:32:26.478 --> 00:32:31.080
and this is what has happened. I said, “Alright.”

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:35.028
I just paid attention to him. Gave a bandhan.

00:32:35.188 --> 00:32:40.347
Next day he opened his eyes. The doctors could not believe it.

00:32:40.507 --> 00:32:44.645
And then they removed him to the another ward

00:32:44.805 --> 00:32:47.421
where Sahaja Yogis went and said, “We’ll give you vibrations.”

00:32:47.581 --> 00:32:50.065
He said, “But I’m not feeling any pain, nothing.”

00:32:50.225 --> 00:32:54.091
He’s looking ten years younger now and so different.

00:32:54.251 --> 00:32:59.702
Now the experience: this is a complete thing for him now.

00:32:59.862 --> 00:33:06.862
He is absolutely into his divinity. So he says, “Mother,

00:33:07.022 --> 00:33:13.929
I am a person now who doesn’t think about anything.

00:33:14.089 --> 00:33:17.902
About life, death, anything. About my children.

00:33:18.062 --> 00:33:22.281
Now I know who You are. I know that I am under your protection.

00:33:22.441 --> 00:33:24.895
I don’t have to worry.”

00:33:25.055 --> 00:33:29.559
Another case was a Dr. Worlikar who had a very bad heart

00:33:29.719 --> 00:33:37.377
so they made a by-pass for him. A great devotee.

00:33:37.537 --> 00:33:40.776
And his by-pass went out of order perhaps

00:33:40.936 --> 00:33:44.875
and he had a very massive heart attack. He, again, went into coma.

00:33:45.035 --> 00:33:48.641
They put him in the hospital. His aorta, in the beginning,

00:33:48.801 --> 00:33:52.482
was eighty per cent clogged. So only twenty per cent was opened.

00:33:52.642 --> 00:33:58.588
There was no hope. So they did this by-pass for him

00:33:58.748 --> 00:34:03.141
and he just said, “Please send word to Mother.”

00:34:03.301 --> 00:34:07.962
That he need not have done also but doesn’t matter.

00:34:08.122 --> 00:34:14.128
And I just put bandhan to him. I was in Australia.

00:34:14.288 --> 00:34:18.303
He, again, was a given-up case.

00:34:18.463 --> 00:34:21.908
And they said, “Now, how can we have another by-pass.

00:34:22.068 --> 00:34:24.634
This pass is finished now, what should we do?”

00:34:24.794 --> 00:34:27.035
They were about to operate him and thinking about it

00:34:27.195 --> 00:34:29.995
when he opened his eyes and he told the doctor.

00:34:30.155 --> 00:34:32.315
“Doctor, I am feeling all right. I don’t know what has happened.

00:34:32.475 --> 00:34:36.431
I’m feeling perfectly all right. Can I sit up?”

00:34:36.591 --> 00:34:40.922
So the doctor couldn’t understand. He felt his heart.

00:34:41.082 --> 00:34:45.478
He said, “His heart is doing very well. What has happened?”

00:34:45.638 --> 00:34:48.328
So, they put him on the test and they found out

00:34:48.488 --> 00:34:52.902
that his old aorta was opened out completely which never happens

00:34:53.062 --> 00:34:57.616
in the history of medicine.

00:34:59.831 --> 00:35:03.792
Now this experience that he had about

00:35:03.952 --> 00:35:10.119
is also because of his divinity that I could work on him

00:35:10.279 --> 00:35:12.459
– the connection was so good –

00:35:12.619 --> 00:35:14.985
and it worked.

00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:21.609
But if you mentally go on analysing everything

00:35:21.769 --> 00:35:26.018
and mentally understanding Sahaja Yoga

00:35:27.236 --> 00:35:32.007
you cannot reach that state of divinity

00:35:32.167 --> 00:35:36.583
from where you receive all the blessings.

00:35:36.743 --> 00:35:41.120
It starts pouring on you in every way.

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:44.529
If you hear the way these people were helped

00:35:44.689 --> 00:35:49.209
as far as the money was concerned,

00:35:49.369 --> 00:35:52.889
as far the buildings were concerned,

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:56.680
the transport was concerned – everything –

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:59.251
as if somebody’s working it out.

00:35:59.411 --> 00:36:03.732
Even if you are mentally Sahaja Yogis, all these things work out.

00:36:03.892 --> 00:36:09.182
But you are definitely helped when your divinity

00:36:09.342 --> 00:36:13.727
is manifesting in a very, very big way,

00:36:13.887 --> 00:36:21.742
in a such a big way that it is not possible otherwise.

00:36:21.902 --> 00:36:24.682
These are not miracles.

00:36:24.842 --> 00:36:27.750
For human beings these might be miracles,

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:29.992
but for God it is not.

00:36:30.152 --> 00:36:33.264
After all the whole world He has created,

00:36:33.424 --> 00:36:35.624
the whole Universe He has created,

00:36:35.784 --> 00:36:38.293
universes of universes He has created

00:36:38.453 --> 00:36:42.297
so what is so great for Him?

00:36:42.929 --> 00:36:51.575
But this is the faith with experience not a blind faith.

00:36:51.735 --> 00:36:55.262
Faith with experience.

00:36:55.422 --> 00:36:59.735
And through introspection, “Why do I do this?

00:36:59.895 --> 00:37:05.457
Why should I do like this?” “Why shouldn’t you do like that?”

00:37:05.617 --> 00:37:08.492
This introspection should start.

00:37:08.652 --> 00:37:14.967
When you are introspecting then this depth moves further

00:37:15.127 --> 00:37:17.111
but more through meditation.

00:37:17.271 --> 00:37:22.529
That’s why I always tell you that please get up in the morning

00:37:22.689 --> 00:37:25.112
and do your meditation and get up in the evening

00:37:25.272 --> 00:37:28.655
and do your meditation. At least before going to bed,

00:37:28.815 --> 00:37:31.783
you should get to it.

00:37:31.943 --> 00:37:36.958
That’s the only way you can go deeper into your divinity

00:37:37.118 --> 00:37:43.438
which is the source of all creativity, source of all the innocence,

00:37:43.598 --> 00:37:48.758
is the source of all the knowledge

00:37:48.918 --> 00:37:53.791
and the source of all the joy.

00:37:53.951 --> 00:37:57.462
So when you get it into your Sahastrara

00:37:57.622 --> 00:38:00.457
– yes, it is true Sahastrara was opened out

00:38:00.617 --> 00:38:03.749
because of that you got this mass realisation.

00:38:03.909 --> 00:38:04.972
That’s true.

00:38:05.132 --> 00:38:09.754
But now the quality has to go up. Quantity is quite big.

00:38:09.914 --> 00:38:12.820
The quality has to grow of the Sahastrara.

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:21.181
And the Sahastrara is the only instrument

00:38:21.341 --> 00:38:26.405
which is going to work out Sahaja Yoga in the modern times.

00:38:26.565 --> 00:38:35.270
If we realise that heart plays the most important role in Sahastrar.

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:38.885
Just here is the heart center.

00:38:39.045 --> 00:38:43.965
How important it is that you have to recognise through your heart

00:38:44.125 --> 00:38:46.155
otherwise this centre won’t open.

00:38:46.315 --> 00:38:49.142
Then how do you get your realisation?

00:38:49.302 --> 00:38:51.320
What a beautiful connection made:

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.807
that this centre here is the seat of the heart,

00:38:54.967 --> 00:38:58.716
is the peetha of the heart. And this has to open out.

00:38:58.876 --> 00:39:01.505
Then only does Kundalini comes in.

00:39:01.665 --> 00:39:06.295
So all this machinery is connected and made in such a manner

00:39:06.455 --> 00:39:10.695
that you have to understand the importance

00:39:10.855 --> 00:39:17.244
of heart connected through this brain

00:39:17.404 --> 00:39:22.812
which is absolutely integrated with heart.

00:39:22.972 --> 00:39:27.793
Sahastrara is the one to be preserved

00:39:27.953 --> 00:39:31.655
by putting left to the right, right to the left and

00:39:31.815 --> 00:39:36.540
everything, opening it out but by recognition.

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.872
With introspection also, you can ask,

00:39:39.032 --> 00:39:40.753
“Why can’t I recognise that way?

00:39:40.913 --> 00:39:44.501
Why can’t I do that way? What is my interest?”

00:39:44.661 --> 00:39:47.315
Now, if you come to Sahaja Yoga for making

00:39:47.475 --> 00:39:51.857
some sort of a power game, you want to have a power,

00:39:52.017 --> 00:39:55.762
you are finished. You want to have money or some sort of a business,

00:39:55.922 --> 00:39:58.677
you are finished. Anything else you try

00:39:58.837 --> 00:40:02.597
like making something for your children or for your marriage

00:40:02.757 --> 00:40:08.437
or family or any such outward things if you come to Sahaja Yoga

00:40:08.597 --> 00:40:12.996
this won’t work out. But just to expand your heart,

00:40:13.156 --> 00:40:15.557
to spread your love to everyone,

00:40:15.717 --> 00:40:19.157
to feel their love within your heart and then

00:40:19.317 --> 00:40:25.317
to put yourself into a position when it responds,

00:40:25.476 --> 00:40:29.796
the heart responds, to divinity within you and

00:40:29.956 --> 00:40:40.114
to your Mother with full mental activity of the heart.

00:40:40.275 --> 00:40:44.511
Today’s subject may sound rather difficult for you to understand

00:40:44.671 --> 00:40:48.871
but I had to say this one day because we are quite satisfied

00:40:49.031 --> 00:40:52.551
with a little of the Kundalini coming out of our head.

00:40:52.711 --> 00:40:55.551
There’s so much to come out. So much divinity is there

00:40:55.711 --> 00:40:58.671
which has to come out and if you have to ascend

00:40:58.831 --> 00:41:01.911
and if you are the foundation of that new age

00:41:02.071 --> 00:41:07.223
which is going to transform the whole world we’ll have to work hard.

00:41:07.383 --> 00:41:10.858
We shouldn’t say, “I don’t know how to get up in the morning.

00:41:11.018 --> 00:41:15.790
I don’t know.” You are on a warpath. You are soldiers now.

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:19.523
And you have to work it out if you have to fight

00:41:19.683 --> 00:41:25.457
the forces of ignorance and darkness.

00:41:25.617 --> 00:41:31.817
This has to be worked out. This has to be paid attention to.

00:41:31.977 --> 00:41:37.699
So what you have to do is absolutely decide within yourself today

00:41:37.859 --> 00:41:41.142
that, “We are going to work it out in such a way

00:41:41.302 --> 00:41:44.822
that we will all become very powerful Sahaja Yogis

00:41:44.982 --> 00:41:50.539
and through us the whole world is going to be saved.”

00:41:50.699 --> 00:41:55.338
It’s a very important thing for all of you to understand.

00:41:55.498 --> 00:41:58.621
Today is the Sahastrara Day which, of course, I agree

00:41:58.781 --> 00:42:04.981
that I opened the last chakra. But, further to go, to grow,

00:42:05.141 --> 00:42:08.631
you have to get to meditation

00:42:08.791 --> 00:42:13.239
where you become silent and your Tree of Life will grow

00:42:13.399 --> 00:42:18.243
in silence, not in a turmoil. If you understand that,

00:42:18.403 --> 00:42:23.846
please work it out in such a manner that you all become

00:42:24.013 --> 00:42:31.458
completely aware of your divinity by which you can see.

00:42:32.966 --> 00:42:37.494
If you have to see the image you have to have a very good mirror.

00:42:37.654 --> 00:42:43.057
In the same way, if you have to feel the Mahamaya

00:42:43.217 --> 00:42:50.023
you have to have a complete, pure, divinity manifesting in you.

00:42:50.245 --> 00:42:51.365
May God bless you.
