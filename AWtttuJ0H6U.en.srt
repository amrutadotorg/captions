1
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:09,395
Now, we have decided not to have\h
too many marriages in Switzerland,\h\h

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:16,080
because, as you see now, we cannot go up\h
to that point where we can have marriages.

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,800
It’s all full of snow, you cannot have\h
fire, you cannot have all the arrangements.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,400
Even a garland of flowers\h
may cost you fifty pounds.

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,140
And it’s not going to be cheaper marriage,\h
in the sense that everything is so expensive,\h\h

6
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,120
even if you find out in the market.

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,850
Now I have to make a request to you people: those\h
who want to get married in Switzerland should be\h\h

8
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,430
mostly the people who want to remarry, or those\h
people who can not at all afford to go to India.

9
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:47,760
But try to help the people who do not have enough\h
to go to India, that they get married in India.

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,460
It’s much easier, it’s much\h
[inaudible], much more simple.

11
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:52,470
All right?

12
00:00:52,470 --> 00:01:06,510
So, if you understand that, if you can go\h
to India and if you have leave, then do it.

13
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,830
It’s better to do it there.

14
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:17,040
And you need not jump…They say that [Indian\h
saying], means a person who is very anxious\h\h

15
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,010
to get married, doesn’t even raise the\h
head-dress here, he ties upon his knee.

16
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,090
So one should not be that much excited.

17
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,650
Take a very sensible view of the whole\h
thing, those who want to get married.

18
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,740
And we have decided on the people\h
who could marry in Switzerland.

19
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:45,940
So those who have no money or something,\h\h

20
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:50,380
apart from this you should try to help\h
them if possible, every way possible.

21
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,000
I will also try to help.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,230
Now another thing I have to say\h
is that you all have to send some\h\h

23
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:03,370
money for My travel, because I have to travel now.

24
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:08,020
We have been traveling throughout\h
England, again I have to travel;\h\h

25
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:13,450
and if there is no travel money,\h
you know who has to pay the amount.

26
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:19,150
But the people will be again\h
replacing the money of the travel,\h\h

27
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,110
which will again be there ready for other travel.

28
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,110
As it is, for India and all\h
that, you don’t have to pay.

29
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:33,130
But, I think that, if you decide that I have to\h
travel, that you should pay for My traveling,\h\h

30
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,925
then it is better that you should\h
send some money for the traveling.

31
00:02:36,925 --> 00:02:42,730
We have been all over the country and, so\h
far, nobody has paid anything for travel.

32
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,060
So please try to send the\h
traveling money to Gavin Brown,\h\h

33
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:52,450
and all the money that you want to\h
contribute to him and the travel.

34
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:57,220
Now another one, we have decided\h
now to keep the emergency money.

35
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,780
Plus, if you people donate\h
more than the travel money,\h\h

36
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:07,690
or the money you want to donate for the programs\h
and all that, should be in the emergency money.

37
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:14,980
It can be used for other things\h
like mailing, for photography\h\h

38
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:22,705
or any kind of such expenses where you\h
have to have a hall – all these things.

39
00:03:22,705 --> 00:03:29,410
Certain people, like Isle of Wight people have\h
sent five-hundred pounds for the program, within\h\h

40
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:35,440
three persons it was too much so I decided to\h
pay half of it to them back to the travel money.

41
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:43,660
Then we have to buy one tape recorder which will\h
cost about sixteen hundred, fifty in the market,\h\h

42
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:50,260
for which we have money – not the whole but we\h
have lot of it – and we have to buy that also.

43
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:56,020
So the only now money left with us is\h
emergency money and the travel money.

44
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,510
Out of it, the travel money is very limited.

45
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:05,410
If I have to travel, then either I pay and\h
then we reimburse, or something like happens.

46
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:09,340
It’s a big problem, because how\h
to adjust it and how to do it?

47
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,040
So keep it free from all these problems.

48
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,730
If you people donate some money for\h
the travel money to Gavin Brown,\h\h

49
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:24,010
it will be easier, which will\h
be again replaced by the people.

50
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,220
But just now the traveling is\h
important, for which you have to pay.

51
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:33,790
And the rest of it, just now, is that we\h
don’t have to pay much for anything else.

52
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,040
So that all the money should transfer to\h\h

53
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,381
the travel money – for the time\h
being, only for the time being.
