00:00:03.349 --> 00:00:17.443
I’ve been desiring all the time that
I should go to Turkey or Tunisia

00:00:17.644 --> 00:00:22.761
where there could be an entry into
the Islamic world,

00:00:26.902 --> 00:00:37.077
because they have been promised that
they will be resurrected,

00:00:37.705 --> 00:00:41.831
and that resurrection has to take place.

00:00:42.032 --> 00:00:45.105
For that I have to venture

00:00:45.306 --> 00:00:50.766
and give them their resurrection which is
promised by Mohammed Sahib,

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:56.725
I mean that’s My duty; and not only duty,
but I’m bound by it,

00:00:56.926 --> 00:01:01.858
that I have to tell them about their
resurrection and to save them.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.287
They deserve it, no doubt.

00:01:10.882 --> 00:01:14.504
When all the religions prospered

00:01:15.551 --> 00:01:19.609
in a very funny manner, I would say,
separately,

00:01:19.825 --> 00:01:22.505
everyone thinking they are the best,
the chosen ones,

00:01:22.706 --> 00:01:28.422
the highest ones, the greatest ones,
believing in themselves,

00:01:30.527 --> 00:01:34.707
they started going down and down and down.

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:43.907
The reason is, you see, there is no respect
for each other.

00:01:46.647 --> 00:01:52.236
And the respect is not there because
there is no respect for oneself.

00:01:52.437 --> 00:01:55.809
If you respect yourself, you respect others
also.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.306
But when you have no respect for yourself,
you cannot respect others;

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:03.773
but you should bombastically say that,

00:02:03.974 --> 00:02:07.598
“I’m this, I’m that, I’m that” –
any religion.

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:12.489
Then your ego works,

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:21.320
and ego makes you a person who does not
know about yourself.

00:02:21.521 --> 00:02:29.008
If somebody has respect for oneself,
he will never push forward,

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:38.715
he will never try to be something
prominent, he’ll never try to show off.

00:02:38.916 --> 00:02:49.186
On the contrary such a person would be
hesitant to do something

00:02:49.387 --> 00:02:56.179
out of the way, something arbitrary,

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:06.406
something showy, because it is absurd,
and it is stupid.

00:03:06.607 --> 00:03:13.771
So to do something stupid is a sign of ego,

00:03:13.972 --> 00:03:20.176
absolutely ego makes you stupid, and
ultimately with it you become idiotic.

00:03:22.977 --> 00:03:28.318
So the respect for oneself has to be
developed and as Sahaja Yogis

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:35.957
you have to respect yourself: “We are
Sahaja Yogis, so how can we do like that?”

00:03:36.158 --> 00:03:40.307
As I told you that if you teach your
children all the time that,

00:03:40.508 --> 00:03:44.472
“You are Sahaja Yogis, you are something
exceptional”,

00:03:44.673 --> 00:03:48.832
then they will have respect for themselves,
self-respect.

00:03:49.033 --> 00:03:50.848
Is a very good word, “self-respect”,

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.766
I don’t know how many people know about it.
Only when they are insulted or troubled

00:03:54.967 --> 00:03:58.223
they think of their self-respect, otherwise
they go amok

00:03:58.424 --> 00:04:03.452
and behave in such a manner that as if
they have no self-respect of any kind.

00:04:05.033 --> 00:04:09.577
So as Sahaja Yogis we have to have
self-respect.

00:04:09.778 --> 00:04:16.578
And when we have to have Sahaja Yoga
as our manifestation,

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:25.760
as our personality, as Yogis, we have
to have a sense of self-respect.

00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:29.467
And even now you can find on the periphery
you find many people

00:04:29.668 --> 00:04:35.224
who lack self-respect and understanding.

00:04:36.147 --> 00:04:42.609
Some people are still sort of parasitic.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.854
Some people hang on to things when they
are told not to hang on,

00:04:48.055 --> 00:04:52.103
to take it easy, to work it out, they
try to assert,

00:04:52.304 --> 00:04:56.685
“No, we’ll be there, we are going to be
there, we are going to fight it out.”

00:04:56.894 --> 00:05:00.811
That’s not for a self-respecting person;

00:05:03.111 --> 00:05:06.175
it’s a foolish thing to do.

00:05:06.512 --> 00:05:12.870
Like two persons were going, one up
on the staircase, another coming down.

00:05:13.071 --> 00:05:18.143
So the one who was going up in his ego,
he says,

00:05:18.344 --> 00:05:22.387
“You better move; I don’t move for fools.”

00:05:22.588 --> 00:05:27.707
So the another one says, “I do”
and he moved.

00:05:31.006 --> 00:05:36.133
So this is what is the sign of a sensible,
wise, self-respecting person.

00:05:36.341 --> 00:05:43.644
He doesn’t go into fights, he doesn’t go
into unnecessary discussions

00:05:43.845 --> 00:05:51.907
and arguments and assertiveness, but
he sees – “Wait, is it worth it?”

00:05:52.108 --> 00:05:54.957
But when it comes to protection of truth,

00:05:55.158 --> 00:06:01.558
he stands up and he can find lot of courage
for the truth.

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:05.004
I think self-respect is the first beginning
for Sahaja Yoga,

00:06:05.205 --> 00:06:09.666
is to develop self-respect in their inner
being

00:06:09.867 --> 00:06:14.719
as well as in their manifestation.

00:06:15.894 --> 00:06:20.186
It shows very well in protocol also,

00:06:20.387 --> 00:06:26.071
like I’ve seen people who - supposing
I have to go to Brighton,

00:06:26.272 --> 00:06:30.302
“Mother is going, all right, we’ll go
in Her car.”

00:06:32.554 --> 00:06:35.732
If it was for My love, that’s different;

00:06:35.933 --> 00:06:40.430
but just to save some money, “Let’s just
jump into the car”.

00:06:41.326 --> 00:06:44.623
That’s not a sign of a good Sahaja Yogi.

00:06:44.824 --> 00:06:49.771
Then it is also in power, when they have
to express their power, you see.

00:06:49.972 --> 00:06:52.489
Like the other day one girl came to Me,

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.311
she had given realization, she was
all right.

00:06:55.512 --> 00:06:59.949
Second day she came, “Mother, I lost
my vibrations.”

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.001
I said, “Why, what happened? With whom
were you talking?”

00:07:04.202 --> 00:07:06.740
So she told Me the name of a lady who
was asked

00:07:06.941 --> 00:07:14.356
to get out of Sahaja Yoga, Alice, and
she talked to Alice.

00:07:14.557 --> 00:07:16.671
This Alice was allowed to come
to the program

00:07:16.872 --> 00:07:19.500
but she took over as if she is a great
Sahaja Yogini

00:07:19.701 --> 00:07:23.298
explaining Sahaja Yoga to this lady and
finished her vibrations.

00:07:23.499 --> 00:07:29.463
Now this lady is such an important thing
because she was going to Florida.

00:07:31.652 --> 00:07:34.261
If she is just allowed to come in
the program she thinks

00:07:34.462 --> 00:07:36.763
she is now a very big Sahaja Yogini and
she can talk to anyone

00:07:36.964 --> 00:07:42.926
whatever she wants to, and spoil
the vibrations of another person.

00:07:43.127 --> 00:07:47.236
If I’ve appointed somebody as a leader,
it is not on the basis of their looks

00:07:47.437 --> 00:07:53.434
or education or anything, but on their
vibrations and their dedication.

00:07:55.777 --> 00:07:59.957
So the Sahaja Yogis have to seriously think
about it.

00:08:00.158 --> 00:08:03.085
Such people are always around to show off
their knowledge.

00:08:03.286 --> 00:08:07.484
You see, in Sahaja Yoga is so easy,
the knowledge part of it, it’s very easy.

00:08:07.685 --> 00:08:12.755
Anybody who is intelligent enough can read:
this is the chakras, this is this,

00:08:12.956 --> 00:08:20.922
they can give big lectures, explain this
deity sits on this chakra. It’s so simple.

00:08:24.327 --> 00:08:33.894
But the compassion and knowledge,
hand in hand, makes a Sahaja Yogi.

00:08:34.095 --> 00:08:38.566
Now some people have another style,
is of compassion.

00:08:38.767 --> 00:08:41.253
Naturally compassion is always sympathy,
as I told you,

00:08:41.454 --> 00:08:47.665
except when it is with knowledge is
all right.

00:08:47.866 --> 00:08:51.049
But just compassion -

00:08:51.589 --> 00:08:56.697
with compassion they will always sympathize
with all the bhootish people.

00:08:56.898 --> 00:09:01.013
If there’s one bhootish person in Sahaja
Yoga, he’ll bring ten more on Me,

00:09:01.214 --> 00:09:06.848
“Mother, look after this person, look after
this person, look after that person.”

00:09:07.049 --> 00:09:10.622
Firstly because that person was damaged

00:09:10.823 --> 00:09:16.623
and secondly because that damaged
personality thinks that,

00:09:16.824 --> 00:09:20.429
“Another is damaged, let us save this
damaged person.”

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:24.673
All right, if it is so, first of all you
should be all right,

00:09:24.874 --> 00:09:29.942
and tell that person to “work on yourself”,
because if you try to help that person,

00:09:30.143 --> 00:09:34.221
your negativity will increase. You’ll go
from bad to worse.

00:09:34.422 --> 00:09:42.443
Always sympathies will go to a person
who is not all right, we should say.

00:09:42.644 --> 00:09:46.137
So you tell such a person, “All right,
you work it out this way,

00:09:46.338 --> 00:09:49.978
but I have nothing to do with you”,
or send that person

00:09:50.179 --> 00:09:54.815
to somebody who is an egoistical,
so they share better.

00:09:55.016 --> 00:09:59.003
There’s complimentary between the two,
and it works out better

00:09:59.204 --> 00:10:03.679
and saves Me a little worry.

00:10:04.942 --> 00:10:09.267
But beyond all this the combination
of these two

00:10:09.468 --> 00:10:13.413
actually must emit vibrations.

00:10:14.153 --> 00:10:20.897
It is how many vibrations you have within
yourself is the point which one should see.

00:10:22.256 --> 00:10:25.582
First the vibrations when they are,

00:10:25.783 --> 00:10:30.670
how are we to know we are all right
as far as vibrations are concerned?

00:10:30.871 --> 00:10:40.657
What is the sign of being a good Sahaja
Yogi, or we are really Sahaja Yogi,

00:10:40.858 --> 00:10:47.013
is that we develop a kind of a detachment.

00:10:50.268 --> 00:10:55.267
First the detachment comes naturally
because you are away from your body,

00:10:55.468 --> 00:11:01.371
so you are not bothered about your body,
you don’t think about it.

00:11:01.572 --> 00:11:04.715
That doesn’t mean you do not look after it.

00:11:04.916 --> 00:11:09.174
It doesn’t mean that you don’t have
any sense of how you look

00:11:09.375 --> 00:11:14.399
and how you move about, because you
have to be decently dressed also.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:19.200
But attachment means that all the time
thinking,

00:11:19.401 --> 00:11:22.082
“This chakra is catching, that chakra
is catching,

00:11:22.283 --> 00:11:27.921
my head is catching, my Agnya is catching,
this is happening.”

00:11:28.185 --> 00:11:34.364
This is the subtler way how Sahaja Yoga
can ruin you, is this all the time thinking,

00:11:34.565 --> 00:11:38.631
“This is wrong, this is wrong”, condemning
yourself.

00:11:38.832 --> 00:11:41.047
So this detachment has to be there about
yourself,

00:11:41.248 --> 00:11:45.306
“No, doesn’t matter, so what, I’m like
a barometer.

00:11:45.507 --> 00:11:48.118
If I go near somebody and if I catch
well and good, you see,

00:11:48.319 --> 00:11:50.872
I’m just helping that person, well
and good.”

00:11:51.073 --> 00:11:56.070
Or you give yourself a bandhan and just
approach somebody.

00:11:56.271 --> 00:12:01.336
So worrying too much about your chakras
is not a very good thing

00:12:01.537 --> 00:12:07.195
for the progress of Sahaja Yoga. On the
contrary, you should try to meditate,

00:12:07.396 --> 00:12:12.588
don’t think of individual chakras, just
meditate with your heart.

00:12:12.789 --> 00:12:19.710
So now you will see from My lecture,
or whatever you call this,

00:12:19.911 --> 00:12:26.974
is that you have to have a heart which
is open to Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:27.175 --> 00:12:31.964
When your heart is open, first of all
you forgive yourself

00:12:32.165 --> 00:12:36.153
and you forgive others, and you don’t see
to your individual chakras

00:12:36.354 --> 00:12:41.565
or bother about others, in the way that
you are concerned

00:12:41.766 --> 00:12:47.604
about one individual, but you look
at the whole as a whole.

00:12:47.805 --> 00:12:52.448
You will then start talking about Sahaja
Yoga – “How is Sahaja Yoga spreading,

00:12:52.649 --> 00:12:55.704
how many people are getting realization,

00:12:55.905 --> 00:12:59.869
how much responsibility I have done,
I should”.

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:02.514
“I have done” means not ego out of it, but,

00:13:02.731 --> 00:13:07.590
“I should do? What work can I do here?

00:13:08.616 --> 00:13:14.153
What mistakes we Sahaja Yogis have
committed that it has not worked out?

00:13:14.354 --> 00:13:19.650
What is the situation? How I can help?”.

00:13:19.851 --> 00:13:22.518
This kind of a, you see, sort of as if,

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:26.374
like you really become a light and you
want to give light.

00:13:26.575 --> 00:13:28.979
So what’s wrong with the lamp which
is not giving light?

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:37.249
But you don’t think about yourself, you
think as a body, the whole thing.

00:13:37.631 --> 00:13:43.693
This is the first thing is to open
your heart.

00:13:44.505 --> 00:13:53.487
As soon as you open your heart you will
widen yourself, you’ll grow.

00:13:54.107 --> 00:14:02.679
For that you need not condemn yourself but
opening your heart is – look at this ocean,

00:14:03.046 --> 00:14:08.802
how it is touching all the shores but it is
in itself, in its own maryadas.

00:14:09.003 --> 00:14:13.095
If you try to press the ocean from any side
it will show on the other side.

00:14:13.296 --> 00:14:17.634
You cannot press it. It has its height,
it has its limitations,

00:14:17.835 --> 00:14:20.844
it stays in its own limitations.

00:14:21.045 --> 00:14:25.115
So open-hearted person is like this,
it touches every shore

00:14:25.316 --> 00:14:29.046
but keeps to itself, to its own maryadas.

00:14:29.247 --> 00:14:34.283
So this understanding if it comes,
the expansion also is in such a manner

00:14:34.484 --> 00:14:38.124
that you do not go into individual corners
and individual places,

00:14:38.325 --> 00:14:44.060
but you keep to yourself and you touch
everyone.

00:14:48.501 --> 00:14:51.481
This is the opening of the heart when
we say.

00:14:51.682 --> 00:14:57.889
Then a Sahaja Yogi will have automatically
a proper discretion,

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:06.191
discretion how far to say, how far not
to say, how far to go, how far to behave.

00:15:06.392 --> 00:15:09.697
Immediately you can find out a Sahaja Yogi
who tries to show off

00:15:09.898 --> 00:15:14.059
and wants to talk about something they
don’t know

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:21.081
and gets hold of ten people around you
and talk about Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:22.552 --> 00:15:27.002
Anybody who sits round like that, never go
near that person.

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:35.677
I discovered a horrible woman in England
who used to do that.

00:15:35.878 --> 00:15:42.860
And then she formed a group against
the whole system,

00:15:43.061 --> 00:15:52.632
but she caught hold of the leader itself and
all of them had to get out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:55.547 --> 00:16:02.416
So one has to understand that we have
to be simple people,

00:16:02.617 --> 00:16:08.122
not complicated. For that heart has to be
open –

00:16:08.323 --> 00:16:12.002
that’s all I can say, open your heart.

00:16:12.415 --> 00:16:16.670
Not, it’s not imaginary, it is a state
I think,

00:16:16.871 --> 00:16:25.739
in which you have to be stationed to be
self-satisfied.

00:16:26.376 --> 00:16:31.037
This is a very good way of approaching
Sahaja Yoga

00:16:31.238 --> 00:16:35.009
for yourself and for others.

00:16:37.168 --> 00:16:41.857
If you want Me to say – rather
embarrassing –

00:16:42.058 --> 00:16:45.815
but if you put Me in your heart, heart has
to increase

00:16:46.016 --> 00:16:51.796
because of My size, you see.
You can’t help it.

00:16:55.327 --> 00:16:58.003
It has to grow.

00:16:58.711 --> 00:17:01.776
So that’s the best, easiest way to do it,
you see?

00:17:01.977 --> 00:17:05.661
You are such lucky Sahaja Yogis that
I’m there with you.

00:17:05.862 --> 00:17:08.370
You don’t have to do anything. Put Me
in your heart, finished.

00:17:08.571 --> 00:17:12.493
You are all right now, no problem.

00:17:15.749 --> 00:17:21.849
Not that “I love you, Mother”, but is
the point is,

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:25.447
“I put you in my heart.”

00:17:26.283 --> 00:17:35.536
But don’t ever think like this: “Mother
loves me, because I can cook for Mother,

00:17:35.737 --> 00:17:40.648
because I can look after Her sari, I can
press Her sari” - then it’s ego.

00:17:40.849 --> 00:17:43.375
The other way round becomes immediately
ego, I tell you.

00:17:43.576 --> 00:17:51.375
I didn’t know but there are instances of
this kind. Immediately it becomes an ego.

00:17:52.135 --> 00:17:56.788
But if you say, “How much I love Mother” -
just admire yourself -

00:17:56.989 --> 00:18:00.961
“Oh, I love Mother so much.”

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:09.717
And you’ll feel very fine within your
heart, as so joy-giving.

00:18:10.083 --> 00:18:17.187
Imagine people who never had Me with them,
who came on this earth,

00:18:17.388 --> 00:18:21.606
had to fight for dharma, had to fight
for righteousness

00:18:21.807 --> 00:18:25.816
and for truth, how they must have fought.

00:18:26.017 --> 00:18:33.134
But I am before you, so it is, “How much
I love my Mother”.

00:18:34.715 --> 00:18:41.690
Is a very simple method, a basic method
for every Sahaja Yogi

00:18:41.891 --> 00:18:46.161
to discover oneself, and to develop
oneself.

00:18:52.750 --> 00:19:03.307
Then the discretion, the light, everything
just starts emitting.

00:19:03.508 --> 00:19:09.348
You see yourself in that light and you walk
in that light

00:19:10.291 --> 00:19:14.279
and people see that you have light.

00:19:17.908 --> 00:19:22.074
Now you are convinced about Me. You have
seen

00:19:22.275 --> 00:19:27.117
photographs, you have seen the sun,
the reaction, everything you have seen it.

00:19:27.318 --> 00:19:33.498
So now that you can love such a person,

00:19:34.286 --> 00:19:45.594
itself is a very big boon for us that we
love Mother.

00:19:47.296 --> 00:19:52.322
Even if you think that I have not yet said
“hello” to you,

00:19:52.523 --> 00:19:56.977
or sometimes I may not look at you – maybe.

00:19:58.201 --> 00:20:01.745
But it’s not Me – it’s you.

00:20:01.946 --> 00:20:06.162
I, in any case, love the whole world –
is no question!

00:20:06.584 --> 00:20:09.366
Nobody more, nobody less.

00:20:09.567 --> 00:20:13.139
But how far you are closer to Me depends
on you, you see,

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:21.225
because I’m a fixed quantity. How far you
move towards Me is the point.

00:20:21.592 --> 00:20:24.719
I’m a fixed quantity and sometimes people
are amazed that,

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:30.608
“Why Mother was not all right with us
this time?”

00:20:30.809 --> 00:20:37.021
Actually, I stand wherever I am, but you
have moved away.

00:20:37.222 --> 00:20:42.032
So all kinds of discretions start flowing
into you.

00:20:45.733 --> 00:20:51.034
Even you are convinced that I’m
the Adi Shakti

00:20:51.235 --> 00:20:58.197
and there are so many convincing facts
that you have – photographs are there,

00:20:58.398 --> 00:21:04.081
and all happenings are there, miracles,
everything, everything is there -

00:21:06.345 --> 00:21:12.868
still you are floating, floating on these
ideas

00:21:15.163 --> 00:21:21.177
that, “Oh, look at this, this is Mother’s
photograph, this is what has happened.”

00:21:21.378 --> 00:21:23.965
Still you are floating.

00:21:26.983 --> 00:21:31.053
If you really want to go deep down,

00:21:32.483 --> 00:21:36.383
you have to just feel your heart.

00:21:37.615 --> 00:21:40.635
There you’ll find the miracle.

00:21:40.836 --> 00:21:45.162
These outside miracles are to push you in

00:21:45.363 --> 00:21:50.246
and there you will grow, and grow in
a better way.

00:21:50.447 --> 00:21:56.358
That’s the only thing we have to find out
and discover.

00:21:56.559 --> 00:21:59.926
This will really help Sahaja Yogis who are
new, you see,

00:22:00.127 --> 00:22:04.818
when they will see how you love Mother.

00:22:05.875 --> 00:22:11.896
Yesterday only we had parked our car
in a funny way perhaps, maybe,

00:22:12.097 --> 00:22:17.300
and they were all about to quarrel
and fight Mr Guido.

00:22:17.501 --> 00:22:20.043
They might have beaten him, beaten him
also,

00:22:20.244 --> 00:22:21.607
but he said - “Why did you park here?”

00:22:21.808 --> 00:22:23.903
He said, “It’s my Mother who has come,
I’ve parked it here

00:22:24.104 --> 00:22:28.111
because my Mother can’t do this”, finished.

00:22:28.392 --> 00:22:35.413
As it is anybody who loves his mother, as
it is, is regarded something very good.

00:22:36.281 --> 00:22:39.110
Now the mother is horrid;

00:22:39.311 --> 00:22:43.788
still if you tell them, “My mother is
horrid”, people won’t like it.

00:22:43.989 --> 00:22:49.549
But you say that, “I love Adi Shakti.”

00:22:52.621 --> 00:22:57.041
[Shri Mataji: Who is it?
Yogi: Oh. Put him out.

00:22:57.242 --> 00:23:00.018
Shri Mataji: Who is he?
Yogi 2: What does he?

00:23:00.219 --> 00:23:01.832
Yogi: Mr Mauro (?) from Switzerland,
Shri Mataji.

00:23:02.033 --> 00:23:04.370
Shri Mataji: Eh?
Yogi: Mr Mauro from Switzerland.

00:23:04.571 --> 00:23:06.749
Shri Mataji: Who?
Yogi: Mr Mauro from Switzerland.

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:10.656
Shri Mataji: Eh?
Yogis: Switzerland…

00:23:15.282 --> 00:23:17.154
Yogi: They came without asking.

00:23:17.355 --> 00:23:21.023
Shri Mataji: Put your hand on his heart,
doctor.

00:23:21.698 --> 00:23:26.869
See, this is how we help. He didn’t
understand what I was talking.

00:23:31.711 --> 00:23:34.454
Put your hand on his heart. Yogi: He never
should come without asking us.

00:23:34.655 --> 00:23:35.917
Shri Mataji: No, it’s all right, it will be
all right.

00:23:36.118 --> 00:23:41.120
Yogi: He should never come without
asking us. Shri Mataji: Is all right.

00:23:43.686 --> 00:23:46.968
(Aside) What to do, open the window.

00:23:56.311 --> 00:23:59.995
Open the window perhaps, maybe.

00:24:08.902 --> 00:24:13.923
Yogi: Yes. Are there certain modifications?
Shri Mataji: Eh?

00:24:28.607 --> 00:24:34.507
Correct, you are there. Is Nicholas, na?
Yogis: Yes.

00:24:34.708 --> 00:24:37.713
Shri Mataji: He is very good.

00:24:48.377 --> 00:24:51.519
Are you all right now?

00:24:58.788 --> 00:25:02.366
Absolutely, in the beginning if you pick
people up, you have to tell him

00:25:02.567 --> 00:25:08.686
just for the puja it’s too much vibrations
and too much for themselves to absorb.

00:25:08.887 --> 00:25:12.488
So you have to be careful. But this Nicholas
is all right, he has suffered so much

00:25:12.689 --> 00:25:19.193
that it’s good for him that he came
to the puja, must be about him.

00:25:23.289 --> 00:25:26.065
But now only you must choose people
who can come to puja;

00:25:26.266 --> 00:25:30.814
everybody can’t bear, you see, this is
too much of vibrations.

00:25:31.408 --> 00:25:36.512
But, you see, I know who can come very
easily [of them?],

00:25:36.713 --> 00:25:39.629
Very poor things - some of the seekers have
suffered so much

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:45.662
that one puja can settle them down
completely.

00:25:48.181 --> 00:25:52.473
It’s all right now, see. Are you all right
now? Person: Yes.

00:25:52.674 --> 00:25:56.877
Yogi: He will never again. Shri Mataji: Eh?
Yogi: He will never again.

00:25:57.078 --> 00:26:00.999
Shri Mataji: He doesn’t enquire. You know,
you know you have a right.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.053
You are on the right path.]

00:26:07.655 --> 00:26:11.949
So we again go back to the same point
is of self-respect.

00:26:12.594 --> 00:26:19.532
When you reach that state of love,

00:26:19.733 --> 00:26:25.865
respect yourself, then you don’t condemn.

00:26:27.468 --> 00:26:30.927
“Because I love Mother, how can I do
such a thing that will bring

00:26:31.128 --> 00:26:38.549
bad name to Her? That’s not behooving
the way I should be.

00:26:38.749 --> 00:26:43.992
I have to behave in a way that My Mother
likes.”

00:26:44.542 --> 00:26:48.865
The whole all question is solved because
you have “Somebody” before you,

00:26:49.066 --> 00:26:53.207
and you know what I like and what I
don’t like.

00:26:53.831 --> 00:26:59.806
So always you’ll try to do things which
will be pleasing to Me;

00:27:00.007 --> 00:27:08.888
but actually it is not such a material
pleasing but is the essence of it,

00:27:10.177 --> 00:27:24.093
the essence of pleasing, and that if you
know what will make Me feel pleased…

00:27:24.294 --> 00:27:26.818
Actually, I get lost when I think about
My pleasing,

00:27:27.019 --> 00:27:31.297
I think, there’s nothing that pleases Me
or displeases Me.

00:27:31.498 --> 00:27:36.791
But maybe the Deities part of it, maybe
that part of Me, maybe that,

00:27:36.992 --> 00:27:42.606
because They always do things which
will please Me. They know.

00:27:42.807 --> 00:27:48.817
So in the same manner, if you can really
work it out,

00:27:49.399 --> 00:27:55.040
you’ll get that inner inspiration and
understanding.

00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:05.583
The essence of everything, we are
on the principle of it, the Tattwa.

00:28:05.784 --> 00:28:12.159
So the essence of everything if you catch…
“What is the essence of this?”

00:28:14.328 --> 00:28:17.944
Now put that test to anything.

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:29.762
Just on the essence if you try to live,
the rest is looked after.

00:28:30.835 --> 00:28:34.189
So the self-respect, the essence of
self-respect is:

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:38.230
“because I’m a Sahaja Yogi,

00:28:38.646 --> 00:28:43.910
because I have got Self Realization and
because I love my Mother”.

00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:47.332
This is the essence.

00:28:49.777 --> 00:29:00.977
If we can look to the essence of flowers –
why there are so many varieties?

00:29:02.646 --> 00:29:07.547
So many varieties of flowers, just see.
Just tremendous. Why?

00:29:07.748 --> 00:29:14.540
Because essence of beauty, the aesthetics
of beauty, is variety.

00:29:15.979 --> 00:29:20.904
Every leaf, if you take out each leaf

00:29:21.105 --> 00:29:27.673
it cannot be matched with anyone in the
whole world, exactly it will not be.

00:29:28.699 --> 00:29:34.431
So the essence of aesthetics is variety.

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:38.857
So we have to have Sahaja Yogis
of different varieties,

00:29:39.058 --> 00:29:45.962
of different nature, of different humour,
to humour ourselves.

00:29:46.163 --> 00:29:49.915
We are not to have everybody just the same.

00:29:50.116 --> 00:29:57.892
But in the essence of it, all of them have
to love the Mother.

00:29:58.343 --> 00:30:02.515
Then the best of yours that you enjoy
the most,

00:30:02.716 --> 00:30:10.190
not the flowers so much, not the nature so
much, nothing more than other Sahaja Yogis.

00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:14.466
Once you start enjoying other Sahaja Yogis
and their company,

00:30:14.667 --> 00:30:17.476
then you have achieved it.

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:24.984
I mean, imagine enjoying every human being
who is a Sahaja Yogi

00:30:26.359 --> 00:30:32.103
and their company, then it’s more than
sufficient. What more do you want?

00:30:32.304 --> 00:30:37.870
You don’t enjoy other people, you don’t
enjoy other things so much.

00:30:38.071 --> 00:30:43.045
But if you are in a beautiful place and
beautiful circumstances

00:30:43.246 --> 00:30:49.083
and you are with other Sahaja Yogis also,
then nothing like this.

00:30:49.284 --> 00:31:00.453
It becomes doubly enjoyable, I should say,
and every moment becomes an experience,

00:31:00.654 --> 00:31:05.957
every person becomes an experience,
is like a wave of joy.

00:31:06.158 --> 00:31:12.447
Every person you meet, every collectivity
you meet, every ashram you go to,

00:31:12.648 --> 00:31:17.915
it creates a beautiful wave in your heart
of joy.

00:31:19.528 --> 00:31:26.510
My joy is silent, but when I meet somebody,
then it shows itself up.

00:31:26.711 --> 00:31:34.135
It comes up like a wave or sometimes
as you see these drops from the ocean

00:31:34.336 --> 00:31:38.619
breaking on the shores, beautiful drops.
We call them tushhaar -

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:43.225
in Sanskrit language there’s a beautiful
name for that, tushhaar –

00:31:44.411 --> 00:31:53.022
and then the waves go back to your heart.
So beautifully is the relationship

00:31:53.247 --> 00:31:58.639
and you just watch it as a witness and
see the joy.

00:32:00.569 --> 00:32:08.348
Then everything melts away, all your
knowledge so-called,

00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:13.204
all your pains, all your troubles,
all your past,

00:32:13.405 --> 00:32:20.288
all your future, but you remain in
the presence, in meditation,

00:32:20.489 --> 00:32:24.905
watching all this beautiful happening.

00:32:25.106 --> 00:32:33.257
May God all of you understand.
May God in all of you

00:32:33.458 --> 00:32:39.777
as Spirit emit that experience
all the time to all of you.

00:32:39.978 --> 00:32:43.021
May God bless you.

00:32:47.496 --> 00:32:56.502
This is the sari from Greece. Just see
that art of Greece expressed,

00:32:59.225 --> 00:33:01.655
beautiful.
Gregoire: It’s like the Aegean sea.

00:33:01.856 --> 00:33:07.212
Shri Mataji: Eh?
Gregoire: The water is like the Aegean sea.

00:33:09.911 --> 00:33:14.296
Shri Mataji: It’s beautiful. Like in
the sea you have

00:33:14.497 --> 00:33:20.576
blue and emerald, both colors, the same
way it is.
