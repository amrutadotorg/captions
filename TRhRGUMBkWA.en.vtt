WEBVTT

00:17.151 --> 00:20.057
Shri Mataji: Yes. Seeker: Shri Mataji,
could you say something

00:20.258 --> 00:25.768
about collective and the need for people
who have been realized

00:25.969 --> 00:31.768
to be together?
Shri Mataji: What did he say?

00:33.040 --> 00:37.079
Yogi: Mother, could you please say
something about the collective

00:37.280 --> 00:40.118
and the need for realized souls to be
together?

00:40.319 --> 00:44.185
Shri Mataji: Oh, all right. That’s a very
nice suggestion.

00:44.386 --> 00:48.751
I would like to say something about
collectivity.

00:49.296 --> 00:53.726
So far as you know, in the history
of spirituality

00:53.927 --> 00:58.019
people have got realization. Many people
have got it.

00:58.220 --> 01:02.217
One after another, many people got it

01:02.418 --> 01:12.000
but I would say one in a million, one
in a ten million, like that,

01:12.960 --> 01:18.942
because we have to have some people to talk
about it, to begin with.

01:19.143 --> 01:22.999
We always see what was written in the past,
you see,

01:23.200 --> 01:28.479
but those people who got realization
single-handed suffered a lot,

01:28.680 --> 01:34.997
and they could not transmit what it was
needed to be given to others

01:35.198 --> 01:39.020
in a way that would be acceptable.

01:39.880 --> 01:43.332
Now as you see, any discovery is made,

01:43.533 --> 01:47.559
like that people can benefit individually.

01:47.760 --> 01:52.860
Every person can say, “Oh, I have got it.
So I can have it in my house,” you see;

01:53.083 --> 01:57.879
but it is of no value. It is of no value,
I can tell you.

01:58.080 --> 02:01.502
I would say a personality like Christ came
on this earth.

02:01.703 --> 02:04.569
We had Christianity; what have they
done about it?

02:04.770 --> 02:08.791
I mean, it’s a sad affair. I mean, to think
such a personality to come

02:08.992 --> 02:12.842
and what a great job He has done
to establish Himself on Agnya chakra,

02:13.043 --> 02:17.474
what people have done out of it, you see.
The reason was He was seldom;

02:17.675 --> 02:20.621
He was alone. It was not a mass thing.

02:20.822 --> 02:23.120
That was not the time, because He had
to establish this center.

02:23.320 --> 02:25.920
Without that it could not be mass,
all right?

02:26.120 --> 02:28.485
It could not be an en masse realization

02:28.699 --> 02:31.992
but He talked about, “You have to be born
again,” and all that.

02:32.193 --> 02:37.800
But the whole thing fizzled out because
they could not get to the essence of it.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.080
One person of that caliber coming on
this earth

02:42.280 --> 02:47.824
found it impossible to convince people
and talk about it.

02:48.025 --> 02:55.782
So one has to understand that anything
that is evolutionary

02:55.983 --> 03:02.319
first happens to one or two persons only,
but then it happens to many people.

03:02.519 --> 03:05.988
Now in Sahaja Yoga there’s another problem
apart from that,

03:06.189 --> 03:08.757
that it is happening to many people,
it is there, no doubt.

03:08.958 --> 03:11.052
Thousands are getting realization, it’s
no doubt.

03:11.253 --> 03:14.927
It’s working out that way, that now
the evolution has come

03:15.128 --> 03:17.359
to this stage, as I say it’s the blossom
time,

03:17.560 --> 03:20.759
many flowers are there and they have
to become the fruits.

03:20.960 --> 03:24.549
But now why is it necessary to have
collectivity

03:24.750 --> 03:27.103
when people are getting realization
like that,

03:27.304 --> 03:30.319
is a very important point one has
to understand.

03:30.520 --> 03:38.000
The thing is that now, when you are getting
realized, what is happening to you?

03:38.192 --> 03:40.639
You are getting related to the whole.

03:40.840 --> 03:44.758
Our microcosm is getting related
to the macrocosm.

03:44.959 --> 03:48.818
Say your body is there and you are
sleeping.

03:49.019 --> 03:53.953
First you get a little awakening. You open
your fingers, all right?

03:54.154 --> 03:56.640
Then you open your, another finger.

03:56.840 --> 04:02.640
Now there is a little trouble on your
finger and you can’t see anything.

04:02.840 --> 04:06.920
So you open your eyes and you pay
your attention to your hands.

04:07.121 --> 04:11.484
So that trouble may be all right but you
need another hand to help me.

04:11.685 --> 04:16.570
So you want the another hand also to be
awakened to that point, like that.

04:16.771 --> 04:21.280
So when the Sahaja Yogis are getting
awakened more and more, you see,

04:21.480 --> 04:24.440
the problems that are facing us, we can
solve them better,

04:24.640 --> 04:27.984
because so many people are working out
the problem.

04:28.185 --> 04:32.543
Do you understand My point now? Together!
When we are together

04:32.744 --> 04:37.120
we understand now there’s a problem,
now I’m going to America.

04:37.520 --> 04:45.508
I’ve gone in 1970 - 1973 first, I think,
yes.

04:45.709 --> 04:49.290
1973 I went first. I was alone!

04:49.491 --> 04:52.050
I mean, I gave them very good lectures,

04:52.280 --> 04:56.399
we had very big halls filled up and
everything – but everything fizzled out.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.895
The reason is the people who got
realization

04:59.096 --> 05:01.560
didn’t have anybody to look after them,

05:01.760 --> 05:06.738
was nobody to support them, give them
assistance, so they got lost.

05:06.939 --> 05:09.879
I mean, they are there, some of them
are here and there.

05:10.080 --> 05:16.440
Now what has happened now? Today when
I’m going to America everybody is praying.

05:16.641 --> 05:21.039
In Australia they are praying. In India
they are praying.

05:21.240 --> 05:24.297
Like attention, you’ll be surprised some
people are coming from India

05:24.498 --> 05:28.559
to go down to America. Some are coming
from Australia to go down to America.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.119
Some are coming from France, some
from Switzerland.

05:31.320 --> 05:35.200
They are all rushing to America. Now
the job is in America.

05:35.400 --> 05:39.982
All right, so, like the attention you see,
as soon as somebody pricks Me here,

05:40.183 --> 05:43.750
My hand goes there, My head goes there,
everything works it out.

05:43.951 --> 05:49.319
So the collective working-out effort is
going to solve the problem.

05:49.520 --> 05:52.113
But supposing if this finger is fighting
with this finger,

05:52.314 --> 05:54.460
can I write anything?

05:54.661 --> 05:59.254
Or if they are secluded and alone, can I
use them?

05:59.455 --> 06:06.680
All this body has to become absolutely
in concord with each other.

06:06.880 --> 06:11.486
But so many are still sleeping. Those who
are awakened at least

06:11.687 --> 06:16.759
must stick together. Otherwise Sahaja Yoga
cannot work out.

06:16.960 --> 06:20.840
Today I find it much easier to give
realization, much easier.

06:21.029 --> 06:25.369
I was struggling with six people for four
years in your London.

06:25.570 --> 06:28.086
Four years, six people.

06:28.286 --> 06:30.009
But once they got realization

06:30.210 --> 06:33.231
it started working faster and the more
people we get –

06:33.432 --> 06:39.736
because the channel that is to be used
is like nerves in the body.

06:39.937 --> 06:43.120
You become a nerve of that body which
is awakened,

06:43.320 --> 06:46.523
and once the nerves start working out
together

06:46.724 --> 06:49.920
realizing that there’s one force that is
flowing through them,

06:50.120 --> 06:57.678
all of you have to work it out together
with understanding of the Divine.

06:57.879 --> 07:01.555
It works faster. Any person whose all
nerves are at work

07:01.756 --> 07:08.080
will be much more dynamic than a person
who is half-dead or is full-dead.

07:08.799 --> 07:12.639
So you can understand how collectivity
is important.

07:12.840 --> 07:19.920
Then another thing is that going to a very
enjoyable part of it,

07:20.121 --> 07:25.440
that when the Sahaja Yogis are collectively
there, they really enjoy.

07:25.640 --> 07:28.760
Because for the first time you start
enjoying human beings,

07:28.961 --> 07:31.929
first time. Before this you never enjoyed
them.

07:32.130 --> 07:35.680
You enjoyed flowers, you enjoyed everything
else, but not human beings.

07:35.880 --> 07:38.491
Pure enjoyment of human beings starts
coming

07:38.692 --> 07:41.162
when you become fully realized.

07:41.363 --> 07:45.039
I’ll give you an example. We went
to Calcutta for one day

07:45.240 --> 07:50.799
and I was in a room in one hotel

07:51.000 --> 07:55.759
and there were three, four Sahaja Yogis
in another hotel - another room,

07:55.960 --> 08:00.119
and one gentleman came to Me for his
realization.

08:00.320 --> 08:04.719
And when I raised his thing, the Kundalini,
you see, they all got vibrated

08:04.920 --> 08:09.967
and they all rushed to My room to know
“What has happened,

08:10.168 --> 08:13.479
suddenly how is it we got such joy
within ourselves”.

08:13.680 --> 08:17.066
They came to see, and this man was there.
He was a great soul

08:17.267 --> 08:19.557
and they felt the vibrations, tremendous,
you see.

08:19.758 --> 08:25.560
So it is not the happening of an individual.
It is the happening of the whole.

08:25.724 --> 08:28.646
And the individual effort is going to be
absolutely useless.

08:28.847 --> 08:32.850
It will be all neutralized. If you sit
at home, do your meditation,

08:33.051 --> 08:38.170
it won’t work out. You won’t go very far.
Because the whole has to come up.

08:38.371 --> 08:46.759
I’ll give an example that when you churn
the butter -

08:46.960 --> 08:50.439
in India, I don’t know, we don’t do that
way; we do it very naturally –

08:50.640 --> 08:56.719
you put a little butter inside that and
then again you start churning.

08:56.920 --> 09:01.558
So the butter starts gathering round that
butter, all of it comes together.

09:01.759 --> 09:06.080
But some particles are left out.
They stick to the sides, stick to that.

09:06.251 --> 09:12.920
They are no more as butter; they are thrown
away as buttermilk. Is as simple as that.

09:13.121 --> 09:17.441
You see, the more you gather together,
you really enjoy

09:17.642 --> 09:22.156
the spirit of friendship, spirit of mirth,

09:22.357 --> 09:28.358
spirit of love in pure form.

09:28.559 --> 09:32.810
So far the love is biased. There’s sex,
there’s lust,

09:33.011 --> 09:36.759
there’s money, there’s this, there’s
relationship.

09:36.959 --> 09:40.907
This is, “You are British; so I must love
you,” “I am Indian; so I must love you.”

09:41.109 --> 09:44.858
All these nonsensical barriers are there.
There you love a human being

09:45.059 --> 09:50.279
because he is a human being and he is
a yogi, speaks the same language.

09:50.480 --> 09:54.187
Now today I have attended a wedding party

09:54.388 --> 09:58.077
and the bride and the bridegroom said,
“We are coming to Paris with you, Mother.

09:58.278 --> 10:03.352
There are hundred people coming to Paris,
because we have to change Paris”, you see.

10:03.553 --> 10:05.644
“But,” I said, “you are recently married.
Now better enjoy

10:05.845 --> 10:07.537
your honeymoon.” They said, “What are
we going to enjoy?

10:07.738 --> 10:10.479
We’ll enjoy there our honeymoon”, so they
are coming up there.

10:10.680 --> 10:13.080
Even if I tell them, “You don’t come,” they
won’t listen.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.602
They will enjoy their honeymoon there only.

10:15.823 --> 10:18.154
I never said, “You come”, on the contrary,
I’m saying, “You go away.

10:18.355 --> 10:20.581
I will give you money to enjoy your
honeymoon wherever you feel like.”

10:20.782 --> 10:23.719
They wouldn’t go, because they know where
enjoyment lies,

10:23.919 --> 10:28.943
with their brothers, with friends and
sisters. It’s absolutely so,

10:29.144 --> 10:35.999
I tell you, that the enjoyment of human
beings has not been there.

10:36.200 --> 10:39.971
Now there are people who live in India,
who live in Australia,

10:40.172 --> 10:42.879
who live here, all over the places,

10:43.080 --> 10:46.477
but when the Sahaja Yogis go to India
you should see them,

10:46.678 --> 10:52.267
the way the Sahaja Yogis in the villages,
the way they embrace them,

10:52.468 --> 10:56.320
the way they feel the oneness. Never they
have felt like this for a white skin.

10:56.520 --> 10:58.731
If they saw a white skin they would
just run away

10:58.932 --> 11:01.256
and hide themselves under this thing,
you see.

11:01.457 --> 11:04.893
And even now people are sometimes frightened
to see a white skin in a village.

11:05.094 --> 11:07.759
They say, “Oh, God, they have come just
to destroy us!” or something like that.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.429
But now that’s over. Now it’s a human
being,

11:10.683 --> 11:12.775
a human being is coming. They are
all embracing.

11:12.976 --> 11:17.234
For there is nothing like a black or
a white or anything left now.

11:17.435 --> 11:23.133
It’s such a love that grows and
an understanding.

11:23.334 --> 11:27.408
That’s only possible if you learn how
to live collectively.

11:27.609 --> 11:33.599
And collectivity also teaches you where
you are. Very important it is.

11:33.800 --> 11:36.999
A person who has not lived collectively
cannot understand.

11:37.200 --> 11:40.253
I have seen people who have their own
families, live with their families,

11:40.454 --> 11:44.571
they are Sahaja Yogis - but once they come
to the ashram

11:44.772 --> 11:47.559
they know they are not yet there.

11:47.792 --> 11:51.801
Because you have to adjust, you have
to learn to adjust,

11:52.002 --> 11:57.895
you can’t have private bathroom to yourself,
private room to yourself.

11:58.096 --> 12:01.492
All right, you can have if you want to have,
but you should also know how to adjust.

12:01.693 --> 12:05.484
As you know, I live very comfortably
Myself, but if it comes to living

12:05.685 --> 12:09.079
I can live anywhere, I have no problem
of comfort or anything.

12:09.280 --> 12:14.040
In the same way we are not barred from
enjoyment. Because of all these things,

12:14.240 --> 12:18.129
the way we carry our bathrooms with us,
we do not enjoy life.

12:18.330 --> 12:22.604
[You] see, [you] want to have everything
absolutely first class that has, say,

12:22.805 --> 12:26.457
that even when we go to the picnic we take
all the metropolitan with us.

12:26.658 --> 12:29.992
In the same way we cannot enjoy life.
We cannot enjoy nature.

12:30.193 --> 12:35.681
We cannot enjoy anything as long as we
become just an individual,

12:35.882 --> 12:39.200
“Oh, I am the one who is going to get it.”

12:39.401 --> 12:44.229
The last of all we must know by
individualism we become malignant.

12:44.430 --> 12:48.095
I don’t say become communist, because
that’s another malignancy;

12:48.296 --> 12:52.361
but by becoming individuals we become
malignant. What is malignancy?

12:52.562 --> 12:57.040
That an individual cell takes up upon
itself, “I will grow, I will grow.”

12:57.241 --> 13:01.104
It doesn’t know how to grow with the whole.
It has no coordination with the whole.

13:01.305 --> 13:05.119
That’s why you say it is a cancer.

13:05.320 --> 13:08.944
Cancer is nothing but is a malignant cell
which is alone

13:09.145 --> 13:15.339
and is saying that, “I have to achieve it.
I can do it, I can manage it”.

13:15.540 --> 13:18.603
And once it starts growing like that,

13:18.804 --> 13:22.079
whosoever it touches, that person becomes
the same.

13:22.280 --> 13:26.760
All these ideas – we are higher race
or we are greater people,

13:26.960 --> 13:30.882
we are moneyed people, we are something
special,

13:31.083 --> 13:34.310
we are of this club – all this disappears.

13:34.511 --> 13:39.773
It’s all nonsensical. We are identified
with nonsensical things

13:39.974 --> 13:44.359
and making ourselves miserable and others
also miserable.

13:44.560 --> 13:48.914
And then you give up all that. Suddenly you
find, “Oh, what enjoyment!”

13:49.115 --> 13:55.070
You don’t want anything, you just want
to be in the company of Sahaja Yogis.

13:55.271 --> 13:59.039
I have seen people, ambassadors,
very highly placed people,

13:59.240 --> 14:03.565
just getting lost with the Sahaja Yogis.

14:03.766 --> 14:07.749
The other day I had a businessman from
Bombay. I took him down with Me

14:07.950 --> 14:15.596
to a place called Gurai; and it was all
in a mess,

14:15.797 --> 14:19.000
in the sense there were no proper
bathrooms, there were…

14:19.200 --> 14:22.890
It was just like a God-forsaken place,
I tell you.

14:23.091 --> 14:26.079
And there weren’t even places to sit down
properly,

14:26.280 --> 14:31.039
only the beach and the palm trees and
all sorts of thing was there.

14:31.240 --> 14:34.759
And the man got lost into that, absolutely
lost.

14:34.960 --> 14:37.320
And he said, “I never wanted this day
to finish.

14:37.520 --> 14:41.279
Is the only day I’ve really enjoyed myself
thoroughly”.

14:41.480 --> 14:47.045
Because there was such spontaneity,
such spontaneous love,

14:47.246 --> 14:53.719
such attention and such purity
in the atmosphere.

14:53.920 --> 14:58.337
To enjoy that purity you have to be
in the collective.

14:58.538 --> 15:02.464
Sitting down in the room, you can’t
understand, there is no reflection of you.

15:02.665 --> 15:06.160
You can’t understand where are you, how far
you are going.

15:06.360 --> 15:08.839
Collectivity is the most important thing,

15:09.040 --> 15:14.679
and those who try to break the collectivity
are doing anti-Sahaja activity.

15:14.880 --> 15:21.919
[You] see, we call it a-Sahaja movement
or you can say a-Sahaja activity.

15:22.120 --> 15:26.637
You have to be one with the whole. Those
who have tried to separate themselves,

15:26.838 --> 15:30.540
all of them go down in Sahaja Yoga.

15:30.741 --> 15:38.263
Try to be one with everyone, to share
and enjoy everybody’s being,

15:38.464 --> 15:44.011
because God has created you so
beautifully. You are so beautiful.

15:44.212 --> 15:48.790
And the enjoyment should not be lost
because you have certain barriers;

15:48.991 --> 15:51.861
like some people can’t take out their
shoes, I mean, just imagine

15:52.062 --> 15:55.079
how much they are identified with their
shoes.

15:55.280 --> 15:59.197
They can’t take out their shoes. To that
extent they are stupid!

15:59.398 --> 16:01.931
[You] see, all this kind of stupidity
drops out

16:02.132 --> 16:05.280
once you meet really wise people around
you.

16:05.480 --> 16:10.451
To get rid of all these nonsensical ideas,
which have really

16:10.652 --> 16:18.682
haunted your head all these days, you get
rid of them and you really enjoy everyone,

16:18.883 --> 16:23.280
whether he is a doorman or he is
a chairman,

16:23.480 --> 16:27.200
all of them are men for you. It’s nothing
more than that.

16:27.440 --> 16:32.119
All that drops out and you start enjoying
your Self.

16:32.320 --> 16:37.320
That’s why collectivity is the only way
I can work out Sahaja Yoga.

16:37.521 --> 16:44.279
I can’t think I can work out through
the people who are separated, divided.

16:44.480 --> 16:48.069
It is said, Christ has said also that…

16:48.270 --> 16:52.576
They said, “What have we to do?” He said,

16:52.777 --> 16:56.288
“When you love each other you have done
the greatest justice to Me”.

16:56.489 --> 17:01.320
It’s true. And when I hear the loving
conversation of the Sahaja Yogis

17:01.521 --> 17:04.560
I feel the happiest. That’s the greatest
happiness for Me,

17:04.760 --> 17:09.705
that all of you should love each other
in purity, without any return,

17:09.906 --> 17:15.080
only for love’s sake you all should love
each other. And that is what it is!

17:15.265 --> 17:19.640
And also Krishna has said, “Wherever people
are there gathered together

17:19.841 --> 17:22.603
in the name of God, I reside within them”.

17:22.804 --> 17:26.644
So in that joint - so-called joint, because
you are all one,

17:26.880 --> 17:31.880
moving with one rhythm, with one
understanding, with one language,

17:32.081 --> 17:36.760
so you all should always meet, call each
other and have rapport with each other.

17:36.961 --> 17:43.596
It’s so beautiful. It’s musical.
It’s poetical. Do you understand that?

17:43.797 --> 17:46.659
May God bless you.

17:51.888 --> 17:55.080
And see for yourself when you cut out
your collectivity.

17:55.281 --> 17:57.755
Just abuse yourself at that point.

17:57.956 --> 18:00.028
That this is one thing you are trying
to teach Me now,

18:00.229 --> 18:03.879
I’m not going to listen to this nonsense.

18:04.080 --> 18:06.561
We are collective being otherwise also.

18:06.762 --> 18:11.481
I mean, we cannot, people cannot take even
drinks without somebody being there.

18:11.682 --> 18:15.011
You can’t take your food alone. In so many
things, I mean,

18:15.212 --> 18:20.119
if you are not absolutely a recluse
you can’t live alone.

18:20.320 --> 18:23.945
Then in religion, in the seeking,

18:24.146 --> 18:29.957
especially in the realm of God, how can
it be?

18:30.158 --> 18:33.547
You all have to be there.

18:39.375 --> 18:42.919
I think it was a very good question,
rightly asked.

18:43.120 --> 18:47.048
This individualism must be given up.

18:47.480 --> 18:51.144
That doesn’t mean you all should dress up
like military people –

18:51.345 --> 18:54.559
that’s not necessary –

18:54.760 --> 18:58.239
or you should all behave in the same
manner – that’s not necessary.

18:58.440 --> 19:01.560
Variety brings all the beauty. But that
doesn’t mean that

19:01.761 --> 19:09.104
if I say it is East you should say it is
West.

19:12.080 --> 19:18.290
That’s the main trouble is, I think,
isn’t it?

19:19.266 --> 19:23.399
That you can’t agree to each other.

19:23.600 --> 19:28.058
What’s the problem in collectivity,
you think.

19:31.687 --> 19:34.851
I can ask the question.

19:44.880 --> 19:51.355
Must get out of individual limitations.

20:00.480 --> 20:03.688
I think everybody should for some time go
and live in an ashram,

20:03.889 --> 20:06.960
is a good idea. But ashram must be such
where there is collectivity.

20:07.160 --> 20:11.600
In the ashram if they are fighting and
quarrelling -

20:13.927 --> 20:17.944
then what’s the use of being in the ashram
also? But I leave it to you.

20:18.145 --> 20:21.639
It’s all freedom to you. You just decide
yourself.

20:21.840 --> 20:25.738
I have not put any rules and regulations
on you much,

20:25.939 --> 20:32.439
because I want you to use your wisdom
and put everything right yourself.

20:32.640 --> 20:39.022
You are all very wise people but must have
concord.

20:39.223 --> 20:43.455
Listen to others. Talk to them. Find out
what’s the problem is.

20:43.656 --> 20:46.919
On small, small things people fight.
It’s a very wrong thing.

20:47.120 --> 20:52.280
Moreover, you have to have one person
as a leader to whom you should listen to.

20:52.480 --> 20:55.834
If I find that fellow is useless I’ll throw
him away. You know that very well.

20:56.035 --> 20:58.172
Throw him away, not in the way people
throw away,

20:58.373 --> 21:00.905
but he’ll just get out of Sahaja Yoga.
You know that very well.

21:01.106 --> 21:04.530
So there should be no problem. But
everybody should not

21:04.731 --> 21:09.278
try to dominate each other. That’s a wrong
idea.

21:09.479 --> 21:16.753
Try to change your attitude. As I would
say, how far can you adjust?

21:16.954 --> 21:21.599
How far can you accommodate? Let’s see
that way.

21:21.800 --> 21:25.937
You have to learn that from Me, isn’t it?

21:27.489 --> 21:31.760
You must find out ways and methods
of accommodating yourself with others.

21:31.961 --> 21:34.662
Just try to learn. It’s not difficult.

21:34.863 --> 21:39.956
That’s the whole attitude of life, is
of competition and this and that -

21:40.181 --> 21:42.843
should be changed. You must compete
in loving,

21:43.045 --> 21:46.989
compete in doing good things, compete
at working for others.

21:47.190 --> 21:51.265
Like “I’ve opened the door, now I’ll not
take the phone”. Is very common.

21:51.466 --> 21:57.399
“I’ve washed the things this morning, then
I will not wash in the evening”.

21:57.600 --> 22:00.961
Then people start taking advantage as this.
Let them take advantage;

22:01.162 --> 22:07.661
it is a disadvantage for them. Actually,
if you see the other side,

22:09.543 --> 22:14.449
compete in service, compete in love,
compete in good things,

22:14.650 --> 22:19.760
of saying good words, of communicating
in a sweeter way

22:19.960 --> 22:23.654
that others feel happy, making others
happy.

22:23.855 --> 22:30.639
Try to change your attitude towards others

22:30.840 --> 22:33.800
and you’ll really enjoy, I tell you, you’ll
enjoy. That’s the way.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.906
You know, if you say something to hurt
someone and upset someone,

22:38.107 --> 22:41.560
it must be upsetting you definitely.
You may not show but it must be,

22:41.760 --> 22:45.671
because whatever you do to others comes
back to you. Straightforward march,

22:45.872 --> 22:51.378
I tell you. It doesn’t stay there
altogether; it comes back to you.

22:52.324 --> 22:56.439
So just try to be kind to others.

22:56.640 --> 22:59.919
You may say that the other may try to harm
you, doesn’t matter.

23:00.120 --> 23:03.960
Nobody can harm you because you are
the Spirit. Who can harm you?

23:04.161 --> 23:08.326
You are the Spirit. So just try
to understand the person.

23:08.527 --> 23:12.170
I tell you, after some time you’ll find
that person will become very soft.

23:12.371 --> 23:15.440
So many Sahaja Yogis have become
like that automatically.

23:15.640 --> 23:22.656
They all are here for seeking God, isn’t it?
So to help them you have to be patient.

23:23.720 --> 23:26.119
Give up your old methods and ways, I must
tell you:

23:26.320 --> 23:32.930
to be curt, to be stern, to be angry,
there’s no need at all!

23:35.608 --> 23:39.919
I’m telling you from My experience.
I’ve tried all these things.

23:40.120 --> 23:44.147
It works, isn’t it? It does work.

23:47.136 --> 23:54.698
And you have to have faith in them and
faith in their ascent, in their quality.

23:55.884 --> 23:59.114
I like people who praise others to Me.

23:59.315 --> 24:06.000
I don’t like people who criticize others.
Try to support each other, help each other

24:07.160 --> 24:12.803
and never talk about their past or anything
like that; it’s very sad.

24:13.004 --> 24:17.307
Sometimes I’ve seen people are very hard
and in anger they say things

24:17.507 --> 24:19.949
which one should never say. It’s not
gracious.

24:20.150 --> 24:25.406
It’s not in the mannerism of Sahaja Yogis.
You should never say these things.

24:25.607 --> 24:29.199
Do I ever say anything like that to you
about your past?

24:29.400 --> 24:31.959
When you write to Me, even if I know
everything about you,

24:32.139 --> 24:34.440
did I ever mention those things to you
at all?

24:34.625 --> 24:36.720
Then why should you say things of the past?

24:36.921 --> 24:41.359
I have heard these things people just
rake it up and flung it back.

24:41.560 --> 24:45.710
I have heard this kind of thing that they
bring it on other people, it’s not good.

24:45.911 --> 24:50.439
One should be very gracious, very kind,

24:50.640 --> 24:55.962
and understand that everybody has
tremendous potentiality.

24:57.179 --> 25:04.772
Respect, respect and respect. Respect
yourself and you’ll respect others.

25:04.991 --> 25:08.791
I hope now you won’t have problem
of collectivity after this lecture,

25:09.001 --> 25:12.402
and if you have, you can listen to this
lecture again and again;

25:12.603 --> 25:18.200
and My special humble request that try
to curb down your angles.

25:18.401 --> 25:22.761
Automatically other angles will calm down.

25:24.600 --> 25:29.440
But if it is a non-Sahaja Yogi then you all
should fight it together.

25:29.636 --> 25:32.079
All should join together if [it] is
a non-Sahaja Yogi.

25:32.280 --> 25:38.003
Nobody dare torture you or trouble you.
Those days are gone now.

25:38.204 --> 25:41.304
None of you will be troubled.

25:43.320 --> 25:48.920
These are all satanic forces and they can
work through you also.

25:49.120 --> 25:53.640
You must know when they give you such
ideas to fight and to quarrel.

25:53.840 --> 26:00.000
Understand that this is anti-God. You are
doing God’s work.

26:00.360 --> 26:05.959
You have to move towards more
understanding, more coordination;

26:06.160 --> 26:11.360
because this is such a tremendous work
and of such a sublime nature,

26:11.560 --> 26:15.823
that we have to be sublime ourselves.

26:19.680 --> 26:25.864
All right, now is there any other question?
[It] was a very nice suggestion

26:26.065 --> 26:31.634
but don’t give Me such big suggestions
that I have to speak for half an hour.

26:36.529 --> 26:39.333
Sahaja Yogini: Mother, when you say
collective consciousness,

26:39.534 --> 26:44.638
does that exclude all the people who are
not Sahaja Yogis,

26:44.839 --> 26:48.023
so does that mean that Sahaja Yogis
are isolating themselves

26:48.224 --> 26:52.303
from the 90% of the people who are not
Sahaja Yogis?

26:52.511 --> 26:56.868
Shri Mataji: What is she  saying? I just
couldn’t hear. Can you come?

27:00.423 --> 27:04.359
You come here and tell Me. Yes,
it’s all right.

27:04.707 --> 27:08.078
Sahaja Yogini: When you are talking about
being collectively conscious,

27:08.279 --> 27:12.420
that excludes the people who are not Sahaja
Yogis and therefore the Sahaja Yogis

27:12.621 --> 27:15.315
are isolating themselves from the people,
from the majority of the other people.

27:15.516 --> 27:18.239
Shri Mataji: Oh, that’s it. No, no, no.

27:18.440 --> 27:22.360
She says that when collectively Sahaja
Yogis become one

27:22.560 --> 27:26.959
then those who are not Sahaja Yogis are
isolated. It’s not so.

27:27.160 --> 27:31.276
You see, Sahaja Yogis have to be strong
enough. Now take it like this,

27:31.477 --> 27:35.844
that there are people, say, who are
in the water

27:36.045 --> 27:38.904
and some people are in the boat,
all right?

27:39.105 --> 27:44.181
Now the people who are in the boat are
in the boat, so they are in a way

27:44.382 --> 27:48.720
different from the people who are in the
water. That’s the situation is, all right?

27:48.920 --> 27:54.640
Now the people in the boat have to save
the people who are in the water, all right?

27:54.840 --> 27:57.094
So what I am saying that those who are
in the boat

27:57.295 --> 27:59.639
must first of all be united,

27:59.840 --> 28:02.651
and then with full strength pull them out.
Why this collectivity?

28:02.852 --> 28:05.941
Is just to pull out the rest of them.

28:06.142 --> 28:11.921
This collectivity is just to achieve their
emancipation,

28:12.122 --> 28:17.291
their realization, all right? It doesn’t
mean that they should exclude.

28:17.492 --> 28:21.799
Actually the whole collectivity is to bring
those people out.

28:22.000 --> 28:27.315
But, you see, there are lots of anti-God
activities going on in this world,

28:27.516 --> 28:31.781
you know that. For example, there’s a guru
who makes lots of money, all right?

28:31.982 --> 28:36.357
And he has destroyed many people. Now
they come to Me and they are saved.

28:36.558 --> 28:41.359
So he may send somebody here paid
for a job just to disturb us.

28:41.560 --> 28:45.028
Then the duty of all the Sahaja Yogis is to
get together and see that, to tell him that,

28:45.229 --> 28:49.217
“You see, now you are doing wrong.
Your guru has done wrong to us

28:49.418 --> 28:52.250
and he is going to do wrong to others.
Why do you join with that?”

28:52.451 --> 28:54.559
On that point everybody should be one.

28:54.760 --> 28:59.919
But if they are not strong and if they are
not one, they cannot pull out others.

29:00.120 --> 29:02.645
You see, My point is like that. Not
to exclude -

29:02.846 --> 29:10.667
is all, collectivity is to include everyone
inside. All right?

29:16.111 --> 29:21.359
I mean to say, there is no specialization
in Sahaja Yoga, in simple words.

29:21.560 --> 29:26.895
Everybody is a doctor of everything.

29:41.174 --> 29:46.786
I mean to say that all the Sahaja Yogis
must form a strong group

29:46.986 --> 29:51.469
by which they achieve enlargement
of Sahaja Yoga,

29:51.670 --> 29:53.940
getting more people into Sahaja Yoga,

29:54.141 --> 29:58.942
more people benefitted by Sahaja Yoga,
all right?

29:59.143 --> 30:02.262
All - anywhere I have seen, wherever
there is collectivity,

30:02.463 --> 30:05.504
like I would say, Australia has the maximum
collectivity,

30:05.705 --> 30:09.847
or India of course it has, but Australia,

30:10.048 --> 30:13.759
in all the European countries, or I should
say the western-styled communities,

30:13.960 --> 30:20.119
Australia has the maximum collectivity
and they have achieved the maximum results.

30:20.320 --> 30:24.040
Only in Sydney, today only, Warren told Me

30:24.240 --> 30:30.199
that the halls like this get packed
for programmes.

30:30.400 --> 30:34.440
Melbourne, there is no room for new people
who are coming,

30:34.641 --> 30:36.744
and it’s such a big compound I’m amazed,

30:36.945 --> 30:40.586
I mean, how many must be going there.
And it is because of collectivity.

30:40.787 --> 30:44.654
And as soon as I went there it started
gathering up.

30:44.855 --> 30:48.159
But before that the people were fighting
among themselves

30:48.360 --> 30:50.645
and many people ran away from Sahaja Yoga

30:50.846 --> 30:55.759
because they thought, “These people are
fighting, what are they going to give us?”

30:55.960 --> 31:03.061
Maximum is in Australia, I think. Then is
Austria is having some problem there,

31:03.262 --> 31:08.510
and as soon as the problem came in,
the whole thing became a very small group.

31:08.711 --> 31:12.083
Again that problem is over now; positivity
has come;

31:12.284 --> 31:15.639
the people have joined together; again
it has flourished.
