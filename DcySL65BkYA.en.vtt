00:09.170 --> 00:12.268
Warren’s words have really moved my heart,

00:12.469 --> 00:20.085
and if England is my heart, England should
also feel moved:

00:22.439 --> 00:26.929
that’s the spirit of Shri Ganesha.

00:29.933 --> 00:39.728
And I must say that I have seen so many
things in Warren,

00:41.252 --> 00:43.863
which are very heartening.

00:44.064 --> 00:46.294
Whenever I have felt desperate about
things, you see,

00:46.495 --> 00:57.262
seeing him I felt I must do something more,

01:02.467 --> 01:07.180
because he really loves me very much,
I have seen that,

01:12.690 --> 01:15.978
with complete selfless dedication.

01:16.179 --> 01:29.939
But ‘dedication’ is a word which doesn’t
have that beauty of love.

01:30.140 --> 01:34.793
I mean, if I’m sitting down he’ll
immediately worry

01:34.994 --> 01:41.235
if I have got the tea, or if I need some
heating,

01:41.436 --> 01:46.576
or little things here and there, and I
watch — I’m surprised.

01:47.084 --> 01:51.461
Like any other Sahaja Yogi he’ll be
jumping up here and there

01:51.662 --> 01:56.046
and finding out things to adjust.

01:57.132 --> 02:05.501
And even if I really once say that,
“Maybe,”

02:06.994 --> 02:11.995
he just doesn’t do it, just doesn’t do it.
He said, “That’s it, settled!”

02:12.196 --> 02:16.582
I have never seen him asking me to give
him time to meet him, never.

02:16.783 --> 02:23.511
Not even once he said, “Mother, I must come
and see you!” nothing, never!

02:24.162 --> 02:33.386
I have not known how much money he spent
all throughout his trip.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.970
I don’t know, really.

02:36.171 --> 02:41.393
And I was wanting somebody to say that,
“Mother, we must pay for his travel!”

02:41.594 --> 02:45.900
because he’s really spent all his money.

02:46.527 --> 02:51.950
And I was happy that David brought this
point to me, I was very happy.

02:58.738 --> 03:03.355
One thing I feel [is] that you cannot ask
for love,

03:03.556 --> 03:07.289
that’s something you cannot do.

03:08.979 --> 03:13.436
It’s a very difficult thing to ask somebody
to love,

03:13.637 --> 03:17.958
but that, I think, is the point one should
see.

03:18.159 --> 03:22.364
When you think of Shri Ganesh,

03:22.971 --> 03:28.039
you just have to know that He loves
the Mother so much

03:28.240 --> 03:35.906
that even a slightest hint, He knows what
I want, He knows.

03:36.107 --> 03:39.545
He knows me too well.

03:44.157 --> 03:51.671
He’s not at all so compassionate as myself,

03:51.872 --> 03:57.281
because He cannot forgive those who try
to insult me, He cannot.

03:57.482 --> 04:03.555
Those who try to cheat me, those who try
to be arrogant or egoistical.

04:03.756 --> 04:08.195
He doesn’t, he doesn’t believe in that,
He cannot.

04:08.396 --> 04:10.528
He wants to punish.

04:10.729 --> 04:14.773
He’s ready to punish, very anxious
to punish such people.

04:14.974 --> 04:19.874
But if I say, “No. Spare him,” He listens
to me.

04:20.075 --> 04:26.731
That’s His quality: He cannot bear anything
against me, cannot bear it!

04:28.208 --> 04:34.439
And left to Him, I think I don’t know how
many Sahaj Yogis would have been there.

04:35.843 --> 04:41.349
Even to say, “No Mother!” itself, He cuts
you out on that point.

04:41.550 --> 04:46.746
But I don’t want that it should happen,
because He doesn’t know

04:46.947 --> 04:56.303
that you are still needing help, and
attention, and tremendous compassion.

04:59.437 --> 05:04.754
But you can only know your Mother through
shraddha, through faith.

05:04.955 --> 05:08.664
And what he says is true. And why this
faith?

05:08.865 --> 05:13.312
I mean you see miracles every day, not
only to him:

05:13.513 --> 05:17.314
such games, such plays, such things going
on;

05:17.515 --> 05:22.075
how I have been able to express myself
slowly.

05:22.276 --> 05:25.547
I don’t want to give you any shocks.

05:25.748 --> 05:36.624
So in a very beautiful manner I have tried
to bring forth the play of the Divine.

05:39.374 --> 05:45.892
But I feel that, even now, people get
into arguments:

05:46.093 --> 05:48.620
if I say, “No, this won’t work out.
That’s not good,”

05:48.821 --> 05:52.187
I have to spend at least four, five hours

05:52.388 --> 05:55.339
going round and round and bringing
the point to the heads of people that,

05:55.540 --> 05:59.592
“No, that’s not good, that won’t help you.”

06:00.973 --> 06:03.357
But once I asked him, “How is it you are
so obedient?”

06:03.558 --> 06:06.657
I mean, whatever I say just he gets a hint,
he’ll agree.

06:06.858 --> 06:11.731
He said, “Mother, I once learned a lesson:
that’s my own marriage.

06:11.932 --> 06:15.958
And You didn’t say no, but You did say
to me that,

06:16.159 --> 06:20.411
‘If it makes you happy.’ You didn’t say,
‘It will make you joyous,’

06:20.612 --> 06:21.944
and I have learned a lesson from that.”

06:22.145 --> 06:26.383
But we don’t learn our lessons is [what]
the point is.

06:28.327 --> 06:33.842
We don’t learn our lessons. We argue:

06:37.271 --> 06:39.525
that comes from ego.

06:39.726 --> 06:44.614
If we have superego we, we make others mad!

06:44.815 --> 06:48.443
Like somebody came from America and mean,
he was just mad

06:48.643 --> 06:54.031
that he must come and see me. And I’m
so busy, I have no time, you know that.

06:54.232 --> 06:56.524
I have to correct this book, I have
to correct that book.

06:56.725 --> 06:59.806
Now we have to do this Advent, and that
is to be done.

07:00.007 --> 07:05.822
I have to look after my household, and
this and that. I am so busy.

07:06.996 --> 07:10.126
But the person really made them mad, that
he must see me!

07:10.327 --> 07:13.410
Now if you come from America, that doesn’t
mean that you must see me,

07:13.611 --> 07:17.188
because you never took time with me. I am
busy here now.

07:17.389 --> 07:24.243
When I went to America, it’s all right;
which is true.

07:24.444 --> 07:28.896
And we do not realise that what we are
doing [is]

07:29.097 --> 07:31.875
that we don’t love Mother, we don’t love
Her.

07:32.076 --> 07:37.830
We think of our needs, our impressions,
our talking, it’s a fact.

07:38.031 --> 07:43.114
Like somebody I asked, “All right you
speak, you are a good speaker.”

07:43.315 --> 07:45.636
All right, the person starts speaking,

07:45.837 --> 07:49.882
and he becomes egoistical. How can you be?

07:52.628 --> 07:55.984
If you just start giving a good speech, you
become egoistical.

07:56.185 --> 07:58.395
Somebody made good photographs, so I said,
“These are good photographs.”

07:58.596 --> 08:01.846
He becomes egoistical! You cannot praise
anyone in this country —

08:02.047 --> 08:04.640
it’s the worst thing. He says, “Agnya
is clear.”

08:04.841 --> 08:07.480
I don’t know what sort of an Agnya is clear
here!

08:07.681 --> 08:09.974
You cannot praise. I mean I try to be nice.

08:10.175 --> 08:14.695
I say, “Oh, your photographs are very nice.”
Immediately the person becomes egoistical.

08:14.896 --> 08:18.669
You give some work to someone, “All right
you do this work, postering.”

08:18.870 --> 08:21.718
Somebody is doing postering: his ego
goes up!

08:21.919 --> 08:24.807
What is this? Like a balloon?

08:25.008 --> 08:28.370
There’s no depth. There’s no gravity.

08:28.571 --> 08:31.272
Now why? This is the question.

08:31.473 --> 08:35.702
He asked me many a times, “Why it
happens, Mother?”

08:35.932 --> 08:39.716
The reason is — I told them the other day,
I think they have a tape on this;

08:39.917 --> 08:43.047
you can go through that — but a simple
thing is that,

08:43.248 --> 08:49.517
that we have lived a superficial life here.
We are superficial people.

08:49.718 --> 08:55.205
Because the society is such, this machine
has made us like this,

08:55.406 --> 08:58.522
and we have read books. We have
pampered egos.

08:58.723 --> 09:03.468
Our forefathers went and fought in other
countries thinking no end of themselves.

09:03.669 --> 09:08.226
Then we had this war. With the war we
became also nonsensical,

09:08.427 --> 09:12.041
either aggressive, or we have become with
superego. We have bhoots.

09:12.242 --> 09:15.668
We have conditionings. All these things
are there.

09:15.869 --> 09:20.285
We are not our genuine Self, it’s the
point.

09:20.486 --> 09:25.650
So, I think the being that is going to be
enlightened by your Spirit

09:25.851 --> 09:29.133
is covered with ego, and on top of that,

09:29.334 --> 09:32.835
is a sheen of that superficial being that
you have.

09:33.036 --> 09:37.872
So, “Mother says”. All right. “Mother did
this” All right:

09:38.073 --> 09:43.225
nothing goes inside I feel. There’s no
love.

09:44.907 --> 09:49.669
If you are in love with someone, even if
the person is in that vicinity anywhere…

09:49.870 --> 09:52.284
you know Mother is in London, just think,
“Mother is in London.”

09:52.485 --> 09:56.094
Just think! If you love me, just think.

09:56.295 --> 10:00.360
What a happy thought it is:

10:02.984 --> 10:07.521
“She’s in England!” It’s a happy thought.

10:10.311 --> 10:12.533
Think on those lines. But it does not
work out

10:12.734 --> 10:17.190
because that genuine thing that is inside,

10:17.391 --> 10:22.591
is covered with ego or superego, your
bhoots are in between.

10:22.792 --> 10:28.084
So, what happens [is] that you live with
that superficial nonsense.

10:28.285 --> 10:33.557
Nothing goes inside. It’s all that level.

10:34.295 --> 10:36.636
You ask anyone, they’ll say, “I’m
all right.

10:36.836 --> 10:41.360
I’m like this, I’m like that.” [not very
well] Why?

10:41.948 --> 10:45.463
Nothing goes inside, why?

10:45.664 --> 10:48.646
Because, the genuine Self is lost.

10:48.847 --> 10:53.555
What is going to enlighten you? It’s not
your artificial thing.

10:54.372 --> 10:59.342
You know artificial fibre, if you have
artificial fibre,

10:59.902 --> 11:02.745
it doesn’t penetrate anything.

11:02.946 --> 11:07.743
It can penetrate into everything, but
nothing can penetrate into it.

11:07.944 --> 11:14.226
Like that, that artificial thing on us,
and we live with it, all the time.

11:15.147 --> 11:18.611
Now why he said about Maharashtra?
Because Maharashtrians

11:18.812 --> 11:22.711
are not exposed to artificiality, they
don’t know what is artificiality.

11:22.912 --> 11:26.580
People think they are stupid, they are
foolish, they are no good for business,

11:26.781 --> 11:28.926
they are not good for this, they are not
good for that.

11:29.127 --> 11:34.787
But the main thing is that their genuine
being is not covered with any nonsenses:

11:34.988 --> 11:37.530
“I am something!”

11:37.730 --> 11:42.900
I have never seen Warren feeling that way,
and that’s something surprising.

11:43.742 --> 11:46.554
I have never seen him feeling that he’s
important,

11:46.755 --> 11:52.450
that he should be near me, he should be
in my company — never!

11:52.760 --> 12:00.184
Never even I have heard him anywhere
around. I have to call for him.

12:00.385 --> 12:04.837
Unless and until I call him, he’ll never
come before me.

12:05.218 --> 12:09.920
He wants to see if I need him, otherwise
he’s not bothered.

12:12.285 --> 12:19.173
He just feels that I’m around, “Mother
is somewhere.”

12:19.374 --> 12:21.108
Unless and until [I call him]. But if I
tell him,

12:21.309 --> 12:22.854
“Warren, I want…” wherever he may be,

12:23.055 --> 12:25.597
he’ll just rush and come. It’s a very good
example for you.

12:25.798 --> 12:27.901
I am happy there are some examples
of this kind.

12:28.102 --> 12:32.278
There are many others; I am not saying
it’s only Warren.

12:34.927 --> 12:39.959
And then, if you take up any responsibility
in Sahaj Yoga,

12:40.160 --> 12:43.675
then you start thinking you are great,
you are a great Sahaj Yogi:

12:43.876 --> 12:46.823
you have done this, you have put
the postering, you have done this.

12:47.024 --> 12:51.869
This shows the calibre, shows the calibre.

12:54.304 --> 13:01.125
People from absolutely dead conditions
have risen so high,

13:01.326 --> 13:04.349
and while people from quite normal
conditions are nowhere there,

13:04.550 --> 13:08.290
just they are just there, why?
(The) Calibre.

13:08.490 --> 13:11.635
Now everybody has that calibre. What
I am trying to say:

13:11.836 --> 13:13.815
every one of us have the calibre.

13:14.016 --> 13:24.039
But it is not evident in everyone because
the amount of covering they have

13:24.801 --> 13:30.657
Everybody has capacity to love, everyone
has capacity.

13:30.858 --> 13:38.170
But if you have covered yourself completely
with artificiality you cannot love.

13:38.371 --> 13:42.054
Now if you ask me, “Mother, how to love?”
what am I to tell you?

13:42.263 --> 13:49.311
I love you, no doubt. I love all of you.
I love you very much.

13:50.290 --> 13:53.139
I am bothered about you. But what I find
then,

13:53.340 --> 13:58.066
when I am bothered about somebody, that
person starts taking advantage.

13:58.267 --> 14:01.439
I don’t mind [if you] take advantage,
but by taking advantage

14:01.640 --> 14:05.115
that person goes down completely.

14:08.631 --> 14:10.603
If I am bothered about something,

14:10.804 --> 14:16.038
then [that] one immediately starts thinking
they are very important,

14:16.649 --> 14:20.273
that, “Mother is so much bothered about
me!”

14:21.876 --> 14:25.093
Now try to understand that this is
a country

14:25.301 --> 14:29.956
which is my heart, is my heart itself.

14:32.573 --> 14:37.688
And Sahasrara is nothing else but it’s
heart.

14:38.909 --> 14:43.050
Have you noticed how it is nicely managed
already

14:43.251 --> 14:49.700
that, if Kundalini has to break, it has
to break through the heart chakra?

14:49.901 --> 14:55.414
If your heart is not all right, it cannot
break, your Kundalini at Sahasrara.

14:55.615 --> 14:57.544
Have you seen that?

14:57.745 --> 15:07.163
That the Brahmarandhra, the last opening,
is on the heart chakra.

15:10.319 --> 15:13.024
I know everyone very well.

15:13.225 --> 15:17.667
There are people who are mediums with us.
I know that.

15:17.868 --> 15:21.560
But they don’t know they’ll go to Hell.

15:21.885 --> 15:26.071
It’s a very dangerous time you are in —
be careful!

15:26.272 --> 15:30.234
And that makes me feel even worse when
I think that they don’t know

15:30.435 --> 15:40.962
on what horrible times your feet are
dangling.

15:43.168 --> 15:45.959
So don’t play games!

15:46.160 --> 15:52.019
I know English language has its own styles
and things,

15:52.220 --> 15:56.795
English mannerism has its own ways,
methods.

15:56.996 --> 16:00.720
Forget that you are English!

16:04.613 --> 16:07.560
That’s the best way.

16:09.437 --> 16:15.139
English think that, “We are different
people.

16:15.340 --> 16:19.627
We are of the heart you see — great
people!”

16:19.828 --> 16:24.046
In Italy I told one journalist lady who had
come, very good lady.

16:24.247 --> 16:27.376
She said, “Mother, one thing I didn’t like
the sentence you said

16:27.584 --> 16:31.324
that, ‘England is the heart.’ Agh,

16:32.223 --> 16:37.996
how can it be? Horrible?” She couldn’t
believe it.

16:38.197 --> 16:39.996
She said, “Only because You said I
tolerate it,

16:40.197 --> 16:44.089
but anybody else saying it I would not
tolerate!”

16:45.620 --> 16:50.551
So how far we have gone down as English,

16:50.760 --> 16:55.604
you must see the reputation of English
abroad.

16:55.965 --> 17:02.936
And advancement we have made is to reach
the status of punk rocks!

17:05.088 --> 17:08.055
So when there is such a situation in
a country,

17:08.256 --> 17:13.370
how serious we have to be about it.

17:14.233 --> 17:17.715
Because this country is going to save
the world or is going to mar the world,

17:17.916 --> 17:24.230
because it is at the Sahasrara. Where
Mother is to be accepted.

17:24.619 --> 17:29.275
Whether Mother is to be settled and
worshipped and adored.

17:31.354 --> 17:37.782
But do we have that seriousness
of understanding

17:37.983 --> 17:42.281
that we are born at a time when
the responsibility is much more on us?

17:42.482 --> 17:44.654
We don’t realise that we are born
in the heart, means

17:44.855 --> 17:49.676
our responsibility is much, much more
than other people have.

17:51.851 --> 17:56.906
On the contrary, “We are born on the heart,
so we are great people!” — finished!

18:01.999 --> 18:08.379
There are certain things which you follow,
simple things, is going to help you.

18:08.580 --> 18:14.901
The other day I met somebody who had
a nonsensical thing like a Hamsa [catch].

18:15.102 --> 18:18.634
I said, “Hamsa, how can you have? Are
you putting oil everyday?

18:18.835 --> 18:23.688
Are you putting ghee everyday?” He said,
“No!” I said, “Why?

18:25.069 --> 18:29.330
Is a simple thing like that, why don’t you
do everyday?”

18:31.794 --> 18:35.265
“Mother is here. She’ll look after us.”

18:36.550 --> 18:40.684
The responsibility is not felt because
there’s no seriousness about it!

18:40.885 --> 18:43.831
You don’t know!

18:44.988 --> 18:51.569
The job is great, you can do it, you have
the calibre.

18:51.770 --> 18:54.331
Face yourself up, every one of you.

18:54.532 --> 18:58.393
It’s not facing others. face yourself up!

18:59.996 --> 19:02.468
And I find, really I must say Italians,

19:02.669 --> 19:09.937
really I must say what Warren says,
is true, it’s true.

19:13.072 --> 19:16.148
We have Antonio with us in the house,
I see:

19:16.349 --> 19:21.998
He’s very different from all other English
people.

19:24.339 --> 19:28.827
He’s very different. He’s so balanced,
he’s so much there.

19:29.028 --> 19:31.970
Then, then there are some people, funny
people,

19:32.171 --> 19:34.024
I have seen, they have been with us,
so far, so:

19:34.225 --> 19:37.134
They will go and do this course, they will
go to this, that.

19:37.335 --> 19:39.482
It’s nonsense going on all the time!

19:39.683 --> 19:42.890
And one person like that can spoil all
of them.

19:43.091 --> 19:47.856
We have so many stupid people on the
periphery in Sahaj Yoga in England.

19:48.057 --> 19:51.252
We do not have so many numbers anywhere
else on the periphery.

19:51.453 --> 19:56.969
We have tremendous people, as well as some
people who are really horrid.

19:57.170 --> 20:00.561
I was trying to make a black list
everywhere,

20:00.762 --> 20:07.482
and we had the maximum number in
England! Maximum number in England.

20:10.998 --> 20:13.789
Now when I am going and leaving you here,

20:13.990 --> 20:16.103
you see my heart wrenches really sometimes,

20:16.304 --> 20:22.044
because I know you are not yet matured
enough. But why not mature?

20:23.622 --> 20:27.159
Because there’s no seriousness about it.

20:28.697 --> 20:32.729
Then they will come, “We need a leader,
somebody.” Why?

20:32.930 --> 20:35.406
Why do you want somebody to hit you
on your head all the time,

20:35.638 --> 20:41.493
to tell you things like that? With your own
dignity, why not come up?

20:44.875 --> 20:47.541
Now I am going, you all have to work it
out.

20:47.742 --> 20:53.689
So when you go to India, even Indians
say that English are the worst.

20:54.689 --> 20:56.270
There’s the certificate.

20:56.471 --> 21:03.152
And you have to be the best people, better
than even Australians!

21:05.778 --> 21:06.609
That’s so simple.

21:06.810 --> 21:10.776
Because now we are at Sahasrara,
working at Sahasrara.

21:10.977 --> 21:14.423
Do you see? Why I have to say all these
things?

21:14.624 --> 21:20.773
Because you are born, you are born
in this country.

21:23.377 --> 21:26.776
You are the people.

21:26.977 --> 21:30.039
But whatever I say is, “Mother speaks
very well.

21:30.240 --> 21:33.663
Let’s have a tape. All right, very nice
to hear!

21:33.864 --> 21:38.441
It’s a great entertainment you know,
Mother is talking! She talks very well.”

21:38.642 --> 21:40.971
[But] it doesn’t go inside, anything!
It doesn’t go.

21:41.180 --> 21:47.262
It’s like a plastic on top, complete
plastic cover.

21:53.003 --> 22:01.388
So, one has to learn certain things, a few
things are, like Vishuddhi Chakra:

22:01.589 --> 22:04.779
now English don’t talk, but they move
their heads too much.

22:04.980 --> 22:11.570
If they say yes, they’ll go on saying yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

22:11.771 --> 22:15.813
All the time their necks are moving.
I mean they have long necks,

22:16.014 --> 22:22.727
and they must go on moving their necks
all the time. There’s no need.

22:23.909 --> 22:28.424
Why to bend your neck so much?

22:29.273 --> 22:33.237
Even if they say something, “Yes, yes,
yes, yes.”

22:33.438 --> 22:36.943
Like they’ll say, “Today’s programme
went very well.”

22:37.144 --> 22:41.372
“Yes, yes, yes!” Themselves certifying it.

22:41.573 --> 22:46.431
But they don’t see, because they don’t
want to see it,

22:47.887 --> 22:49.622
that’s Vishuddhi Chakra.

22:49.823 --> 22:53.379
You don’t talk, because when you talk,
horrible things come out,

22:53.580 --> 22:56.852
so you’re so afraid of talking that you
just don’t talk.

22:57.053 --> 23:00.449
But talk to yourself on the mirror, talk
to yourself.

23:00.650 --> 23:07.773
See how you can respect, how you can be
kind, how you could be nice.

23:07.974 --> 23:11.770
But no, the practice is more of sarcasm,

23:11.971 --> 23:17.380
more of saying harsh things, horrible
things,

23:18.404 --> 23:20.623
and that’s it.

23:20.824 --> 23:25.682
It should have, I know is a flair, it
should have a beautiful thing.

23:25.883 --> 23:33.540
It should not be serious sermon, no.
But say something sweet and nice.

23:35.441 --> 23:41.286
It’s so evident when I say something sweet.

23:41.487 --> 23:52.263
Like the other day, we were in France,
and I asked Guido,

23:52.464 --> 23:56.337
“You’d better speak in Italian and
somebody should translate you.”

23:56.538 --> 23:59.364
On the way I was just thinking, “Who
will translate Guido,

23:59.565 --> 24:08.499
because somebody who knows French and
Italian well, who will do that?”

24:08.700 --> 24:13.999
And when I entered the hall I saw Ruth,
you see, standing there with her.

24:14.200 --> 24:18.839
I had not seen her. I didn’t know she
was there. She had come all the way.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.365
And all the way she’s run from there,

24:21.566 --> 24:26.418
and now she’s holding in her hand this mic,
and she is holding fort.

24:26.619 --> 24:32.006
You know, my heart became so large,
and I really felt like embracing her.

24:32.209 --> 24:37.379
And the eyes you see, spoke what I felt.

24:37.580 --> 24:40.551
The way she came round you see, she was
there.

24:40.752 --> 24:45.436
I was worried who will translate and there
she was.

24:45.637 --> 24:48.099
You see, I also get help like this,

24:48.300 --> 24:52.994
when people love me I know I get help.

24:53.195 --> 24:57.280
But if they don’t love me there are
obstructions, problems, this, that.

24:57.481 --> 25:03.642
All nonsense -  you get so fed up you don’t
want to see them, sometimes it happens.

25:03.843 --> 25:07.334
But if there is love, you know the whole
communication works through love,

25:07.535 --> 25:11.590
this subtle love. The whole ether has got
this subtler love,

25:11.791 --> 25:14.795
every matter has got this subtler love,
everything has.

25:14.996 --> 25:19.404
And the whole thing goes into waves and
you just get the message.

25:19.605 --> 25:22.255
But if you are not on that reception point

25:22.456 --> 25:27.838
or if you are not there nothing works:
neither you nor me.

25:28.039 --> 25:33.286
It’s a mutual thing. I help you, but you
help me too. What’s me is you.

25:33.487 --> 25:37.667
But you are not at that level because you
are on superficiality.

25:37.868 --> 25:42.316
And because of this superficiality, also,
you are not collective.

25:42.517 --> 25:47.594
But the sense of collectivity is very, very
tricky also, one must understand.

25:47.795 --> 25:53.138
Some people start forming groups and they
think they have been collective.

25:55.448 --> 26:02.450
Forming a group is a sign of most
uncollective behaviour.

26:03.243 --> 26:04.904
But they think, “We have been very
collective,

26:05.105 --> 26:09.990
we have been very nice, you see!”
Very happy people!

26:11.366 --> 26:17.864
So what I have to tell you is that you
[should] understand your responsibility.

26:18.197 --> 26:25.127
You are in the head office, in the head
office.

26:26.674 --> 26:28.469
And the people who are not in the head
office

26:28.670 --> 26:32.863
are doing much, much better than you.

26:34.284 --> 26:38.657
Then the whole office has to collapse.

26:44.509 --> 26:48.300
Suddenly I hear a news that somebody
is fighting with someone.

26:48.501 --> 26:55.747
Again he is gone back to his normal self.
Only in England.

26:57.196 --> 27:02.957
He gets re-possessed. Again he is left out,
again he is re-possessed.

27:03.158 --> 27:08.712
Again he is clearer, again he is
re-possessed.

27:09.410 --> 27:16.041
Because there is no seriousness about it.

27:16.323 --> 27:27.190
The faith that is serious gives you awe.

27:29.514 --> 27:34.374
It gives you a feeling of joy, but there
is awe.

27:34.580 --> 27:40.522
You love that awe, enjoy that awe.

27:42.109 --> 27:48.407
Mother is around. What are we doing?
Where are we?

27:48.608 --> 27:55.481
And that’s the first sign, that’s the first
sign, that you are realising

27:55.704 --> 28:00.250
who is your Mother — first sign is.

28:05.558 --> 28:08.985
It is very easy just to jump into it,

28:09.186 --> 28:13.455
just like your Kundalini awakening,
I can tell you.

28:17.052 --> 28:20.400
And Americans you know are speedy people.

28:20.600 --> 28:27.323
I knew if they start, they have to just
start, that’s the point. I know that.

28:27.524 --> 28:31.376
Americans have to just start, and they’ll
shoot off,

28:31.577 --> 28:34.680
and they shoot off very fast. They have
speed.

28:34.881 --> 28:43.513
If they take the speed you must know
what they are capable of.

28:43.714 --> 28:46.264
There’s another one that’s coming up
very well,

28:46.465 --> 28:51.514
which I must tell you, is Munich. I didn’t
want to go there.

28:51.715 --> 28:57.171
There was a Polish, stupid, woman, she told
me all wrong about Munich people.

28:57.372 --> 29:00.604
So I thought, “If this is the sample, I’d
better not go.”

29:00.805 --> 29:05.529
Then I felt the vibrations: and tremendous
vibrations!

29:05.730 --> 29:10.702
And the seriousness with which they were
hearing me, the intensity,

29:10.903 --> 29:14.486
as if there was a mathematical class
or some sort of a science class

29:14.687 --> 29:20.984
I was talking about, with complete
attention, not even blinking

29:21.785 --> 29:29.768
Absolute absorption of every word I was
saying.

29:29.969 --> 29:32.346
I was amazed at these people.

29:32.552 --> 29:38.058
And once the Germans get to Sahaj Yoga,
God save you all!

29:39.114 --> 29:42.842
I can assure you, you cannot come up
to their levels,

29:43.049 --> 29:45.762
because they have built up themselves
like that.

29:45.963 --> 29:50.386
They are built up people. They are people
of discipline.

29:50.587 --> 29:56.064
And when they will come to Sahaj Yoga
you will see what will happen.

29:56.265 --> 30:03.430
So all this lovey-dovey business, and this
kind of a what you call this,

30:03.631 --> 30:05.291
I don’t know in English word what you call.
Sahaj Yogi: Wishy-washy.

30:05.492 --> 30:08.006
Shri Mataji: Wishy-washy is different.
What I am saying is a person

30:08.207 --> 30:11.156
who is neither here nor there: all the time
bending like this.

30:11.357 --> 30:15.620
Lecha-pecha as we call in Hindi language.

30:17.275 --> 30:22.169
And also telling me, “I am like this!”
All this nonsense!

30:22.391 --> 30:26.393
How many will be left out? I don’t know.

30:26.997 --> 30:34.586
So, if I say anything, just know that
I know what it is.

30:35.620 --> 30:39.050
I know what is going to happen.

30:39.724 --> 30:43.084
But you won’t learn your lessons, I know.

30:43.285 --> 30:48.811
If I told somebody, “Don’t. Go back!”
or, “Stay back!”

30:49.012 --> 30:53.756
that person learns ultimately that, “This
was the thing, correct. Mother said it.”

30:53.957 --> 30:58.422
But how many times? It is the point now.

31:02.398 --> 31:05.434
So now, I am going away.

31:05.635 --> 31:11.569
I want to tell you that we all have to be
serious people.

31:11.770 --> 31:16.003
Whatever mistakes you have committed,
forget it.

31:17.674 --> 31:21.427
Be serious people! Those who are
egoistical, trying to form groups,

31:21.628 --> 31:24.338
are mediums like, they talk like stupid
people,

31:24.539 --> 31:28.396
trying to organise programmes in a stupid
way,

31:28.597 --> 31:34.649
giving big lectures, should come down
to normal now! Nothing doing!

31:36.348 --> 31:41.345
Be serious! We have to be alert.

31:41.546 --> 31:48.164
Those who will sleep now will lose
completely.

31:49.660 --> 31:54.009
I must warn you. It’s important. Time
is short.

31:54.210 --> 31:58.514
You are important people, no doubt
about it.

31:58.715 --> 32:05.571
But if you are no good, you will be losing
your position completely.

32:07.800 --> 32:16.803
The day when I am thinking of going
to India - for a Mother,

32:17.004 --> 32:22.642
she’s more worried about people who are
still not there. She is always worried.

32:22.843 --> 32:25.201
It’s like a boat is going.

32:25.402 --> 32:30.968
I’ve got many people in the boat quite
settled down, even from England.

32:31.169 --> 32:37.113
But there are many still halfway in the
water, you see, coming up, going down.

32:37.314 --> 32:39.199
You are not worried about the people who
are on the boat,

32:39.399 --> 32:44.205
but you are worried about the people
who are still halfway.

32:44.689 --> 32:49.339
And that worry is on my head.

32:50.482 --> 32:55.458
I am serious. The climate is serious.
The weather is serious.

32:55.664 --> 32:59.930
How it rained and rained and rained today!

33:02.552 --> 33:06.770
The whole nature is bothered.

33:07.989 --> 33:14.110
Don’t think that only if you are educated,
uneducated,

33:14.311 --> 33:17.601
you come from this sort of a life or that -
that’s nothing important,

33:17.802 --> 33:21.656
Spirit is above all these things.

33:21.857 --> 33:27.795
But to make the Spirit shine, you see,
to work on your nerves,

33:28.011 --> 33:33.591
that sheen [of superficiality] has to go
away, otherwise it will never work.

33:36.691 --> 33:44.406
Whatever you do, it should please me,
it’s one of the ways. It should please me.

33:48.974 --> 33:52.422
That’s one of the signs. So how do we
do it?

33:52.623 --> 33:58.251
Put me in your heart! Just try to put me
in your heart, it’s very simple.

33:58.452 --> 34:03.465
I am before you now. I am in person.

34:06.100 --> 34:11.769
I was trying to give Realisation to one
of my relations just today.

34:11.970 --> 34:13.700
And I said that, “You don’t close your
eyes.”

34:13.901 --> 34:17.066
He said, “No, I’m not looking at your face

34:17.267 --> 34:21.978
because when I see you, I feel you are
my aunt.

34:22.179 --> 34:27.260
But I am just looking at your feet so that
I shouldn’t feel anymore

34:27.461 --> 34:31.257
that you are my aunt. You are very great.

34:31.458 --> 34:35.544
And your face is the one that puts me
into illusions.”

34:35.745 --> 34:40.156
He could see it’s a Mahamaya. He said,
“Only at your feet I look.

34:40.357 --> 34:45.524
And through your feet only I can get over
this barrier, this feeling.”

34:45.725 --> 34:52.443
In the same way when I am a Mahamaya,
I know I am, I had to be.

34:54.814 --> 35:02.469
But you have to put my feet into your
heart.

35:08.295 --> 35:13.419
Just my feet into your heart.

35:14.112 --> 35:21.278
Because photo, face, everything might be
an illusion.

35:22.495 --> 35:31.217
Might be by seeing my face, you do not get
over your barriers.

35:35.247 --> 35:39.478
To say, “I must see Mother.” “I must
do this.”

35:39.679 --> 35:43.538
“Mother must come to my house.” “She must
have food at my place.”

35:43.739 --> 35:46.826
“She must visit my home.” All this is
so stupid,

35:47.027 --> 35:51.548
I cannot understand what’s the matter
with these people!

35:56.903 --> 35:59.014
Mother, please come in my heart.

35:59.215 --> 36:02.200
Let me clean my heart so that you are
there.

36:02.401 --> 36:06.396
Put your feet into my heart.

36:07.761 --> 36:12.713
Let your feet be worshipped in my heart.

36:13.069 --> 36:16.845
Let me not be in delusion.

36:17.059 --> 36:20.484
Take me away from illusions.

36:20.685 --> 36:23.169
Keep me in reality.

36:23.370 --> 36:28.251
Take away the sheen of superficiality.

36:28.452 --> 36:32.280
Let me enjoy your feet in my heart.

36:32.481 --> 36:37.216
Let me see your feet in my heart.

36:37.962 --> 36:41.054
Only such people.

36:41.641 --> 36:44.658
Even Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha have
done that.

36:44.859 --> 36:48.512
So don’t you think you have to do it?

36:50.930 --> 36:53.646
So humble down yourself!

36:53.847 --> 36:57.622
Humble down yourself in your heart.

36:57.823 --> 36:59.891
Humble down in your heart.

37:00.092 --> 37:04.473
Enjoy your humility. Enjoy your virtues.

37:04.674 --> 37:09.861
The greatest virtue of a Sahaj Yogi
is humility.

37:10.638 --> 37:16.286
Now, so many things you have seen
to convince you.

37:16.487 --> 37:21.872
But in no way it can mean any kind
of subjection,

37:22.073 --> 37:27.364
because what subjection you can give me?
Think of that.

37:28.721 --> 37:35.396
When every subjection is a blessing,
what subjection you are giving me?

37:37.428 --> 37:41.023
Every feeling in the heart is a blessing.

37:41.229 --> 37:50.222
Just now you feel it and you feel the joy,
in your heart.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.528
Then what is your subjection? About what?

37:54.729 --> 37:59.358
I can understand people who are just newly
come, who are good for nothing.

37:59.559 --> 38:01.946
But you are not on the periphery.

38:02.147 --> 38:05.763
But some of them do go into periphery
in no time.

38:05.964 --> 38:10.212
You give them some work — finished!
If I am sweet to someone — finished!

38:10.413 --> 38:13.792
If I see someone — finished! I mean,
this is too much.

38:13.993 --> 38:17.736
I can’t even be nice to you.

38:25.319 --> 38:32.168
If you do any mistakes or anything, then
you get your left Vishuddhi.

38:32.369 --> 38:35.124
You’ve done your mistake, all right,
finish it.

38:35.325 --> 38:38.112
You love me. Maybe there’s something
wrong in the love

38:38.313 --> 38:40.109
or maybe something has happened,
doesn’t matter.

38:40.310 --> 38:46.511
“Now, I’m going to be cautious. I’m not
going to make any mistakes.

38:46.712 --> 38:51.332
How could I do this mistake? Because
I was not fully in love.

38:51.533 --> 38:54.670
If I had loved something, I would have
not done such a mistake!”

38:54.871 --> 38:58.752
All right, so develop your love.
No. you will do,

38:58.953 --> 39:03.379
“I feel guilty because I have done
such a thing.”

39:04.769 --> 39:09.511
So you miss this and that both. So your
mistake becomes a barrier again.

39:09.712 --> 39:12.755
Don’t feel guilty about it. We have
to progress further.

39:12.956 --> 39:15.329
Forget the past. Forget the past. Forget
the past.

39:15.530 --> 39:20.086
We have to go further. We have to be
serious people.

39:21.816 --> 39:27.944
When we talk, we should talk with that
dignity of that awe.

39:30.975 --> 39:32.670
That’s very important

39:32.871 --> 39:38.057
and once you develop that awe your
Ekadasha will disappear.

39:40.197 --> 39:45.343
Ekadasha will disappear. Just think
of the awe.

39:54.249 --> 40:02.098
See the silence and the joy, and the joy
of the awe

40:02.299 --> 40:06.611
is deep, very deep, like a sea.

40:07.545 --> 40:10.043
(The) sea on superficial level is very
turbulent,

40:10.244 --> 40:14.570
but inside is silent, absolutely silent.

40:14.771 --> 40:21.175
Feel that depth. Without awe, you cannot
go down.

40:25.259 --> 40:31.917
I have sometimes even said little loudly
some things to Warren, I know,

40:32.131 --> 40:36.634
but it’s never, never felt with him. But
with some people I have never said

40:36.835 --> 40:41.722
because I know the person won’t take it
from me.

40:44.941 --> 40:51.938
But he never feels that I have said
anything wrong or to hurt him in any way,

40:55.588 --> 41:00.072
that’s the sign of complete awe.

41:05.770 --> 41:10.488
And it’s just a wee bit of penetration,

41:10.704 --> 41:15.394
a very little bit of penetration
[that’s needed].

41:15.595 --> 41:21.229
Forget the self-importance. Forget the
greatness that you think about yourself.

41:21.430 --> 41:28.872
When you become the zero then you become
the Mother.

41:31.173 --> 41:36.379
As long as you are like a cup, you are
small.

41:36.580 --> 41:41.689
When the boundaries of the cups are broken,
there’s no more a cup.

41:43.831 --> 41:47.226
And this is what today I have to tell you.

41:47.427 --> 41:56.085
Today is the eleventh day and ten days,

41:56.744 --> 42:01.531
out of which nine days were the periods
of fights.

42:01.732 --> 42:05.528
Tenth day is the period of victory.

42:05.729 --> 42:10.154
Now eleventh day is of enjoyment.

42:10.636 --> 42:18.338
But how can the people who do not have
the awe, enjoy? I cannot understand.

42:21.023 --> 42:27.881
Because Ekadasha forms the barrier.

42:28.104 --> 42:32.400
And the barrier of Ekadasha, you know
what it is.

42:33.861 --> 42:42.029
Feel the awe and you’ll go deep into your
heart, deep into your heart.

42:42.245 --> 42:49.910
Because you are at a point where just you
have to have the gravity to go down.

42:51.522 --> 42:56.672
[It’s] working out: try to keep that.

42:58.195 --> 43:01.811
Slowly and slowly you all have come up
to a point;

43:02.012 --> 43:08.329
only thing is now develop your depth.
Go deep down.

43:08.529 --> 43:10.758
I know there are frivolous people

43:10.959 --> 43:15.659
but they’ll all be dropped out in no time.
Don’t worry about them.

43:15.859 --> 43:18.575
I know what people are doing, how they
are behaving.

43:18.776 --> 43:25.536
I know every one of you very well,
each one of you.

43:28.253 --> 43:31.533
So, respect your body, respect yourself,

43:31.734 --> 43:35.912
keep your hamsas all right at least.

43:37.596 --> 43:42.258
And I am sure, if you become serious
about it…

43:42.459 --> 43:47.243
you need a serious understanding of the
whole thing, that’s what is lacking.

43:47.444 --> 43:50.070
Because if you love someone,

43:50.271 --> 43:54.685
the whole thing becomes an entire
possession sort of thing,

43:54.886 --> 43:58.910
the entire being is so seriously involved
into it

43:59.110 --> 44:04.499
that you cannot afford to miss anything.

44:04.705 --> 44:09.376
And that’s what is going to help you.

44:12.801 --> 44:18.537
But seriousness never means you are
not enjoying.

44:20.365 --> 44:26.311
Enjoyment is so deep: it’s pouring into
the heart.

44:26.512 --> 44:32.868
I play with you. I always try to say things
that will please you.

44:33.069 --> 44:36.666
And it should please you much more that
I have said — what today is that —

44:36.867 --> 44:42.977
how to reach your depths, to reach that
gravity

44:43.178 --> 44:45.752
that will make you the gurus.

44:45.953 --> 44:50.800
Today I had to talk to you like a guru,
because I feel

44:51.001 --> 44:58.731
that now the time has come for all of you
to become gurus of the right type.

44:58.932 --> 45:08.175
Not with egos or talking big and creating
a big sort of a show out of you.

45:08.376 --> 45:13.252
But a definite depth within you

45:13.453 --> 45:18.767
that people see that, “Here is a beacon
of Mother.”

45:21.048 --> 45:26.526
And it is so fantastic!

45:26.974 --> 45:32.202
The whole thing is so great, to be that.

45:32.417 --> 45:36.229
This is what the gurus used to do,
first of all,

45:36.430 --> 45:41.003
is to cleanse people, clear them out, take
out their barriers,

45:41.204 --> 45:47.026
make them take out their egos, by hanging
them round, putting them on top of a well,

45:47.227 --> 45:50.108
putting them down five, six times, dipping
them down.

45:50.309 --> 45:53.835
They used to do all this for what?

45:54.512 --> 46:01.139
But now you can do it because I am before
you!

46:07.445 --> 46:11.061
Because I have come.

46:20.711 --> 46:26.483
This is the reason. Understand what Warren
has, so rightly, said.

46:26.684 --> 46:32.336
You might say that “Mother was working
through him.” Maybe.

46:33.153 --> 46:37.808
But, I always work through you if you are
one with me.

46:38.009 --> 46:41.703
Even when I am speaking, you are speaking.

46:41.904 --> 46:47.909
And when you are speaking, I am speaking.
You know that.

46:48.726 --> 46:56.355
But with all this, that awe is very
important.

47:02.996 --> 47:10.222
And that gives you the love that thinks:

47:12.008 --> 47:17.986
complete integration of your heart and
your brain.

47:18.187 --> 47:22.793
The love that thinks is thoughtful,
the love that thinks.

47:22.994 --> 47:29.215
And then the third integration: the love
that acts.

47:29.666 --> 47:37.355
But first this integration must be brought
in: the love that thinks,

47:40.208 --> 47:47.401
which understands, which feels.

47:47.602 --> 47:53.147
And then the love that acts.

47:55.802 --> 48:02.101
But the basic is the love — it starts from
the heart — is the love.

48:20.430 --> 48:26.113
I think you’d better take my tape today
and listen to it.

48:26.314 --> 48:31.871
Meditate. Meditate on that.

48:32.470 --> 48:41.469
I want to see my children in England
develop the depth

48:42.358 --> 48:51.931
in language, in speech, in feelings,
in expressions, in the personality.

48:53.305 --> 48:57.745
It’s only the awe that will make it.

48:57.946 --> 49:01.784
But awe which is not frightening, but awe
that’s joy-giving.

49:01.985 --> 49:05.215
This is the integration of it.

49:05.668 --> 49:14.813
Awe that is joy-giving, is not frightening.

49:17.171 --> 49:19.157
Open your hearts!

49:19.358 --> 49:24.059
But it doesn’t mean you should be
frivolous, [but] with all the care.

49:24.260 --> 49:29.952
Have you seen a lotus opening? How
beautifully it opens:

49:30.153 --> 49:37.143
slowly, every petal so careful not to hit
each other. Slowly it opens out.

49:37.344 --> 49:45.481
And then the fragrance starts pouring
in the most dignified manner.

49:45.695 --> 49:53.258
Such a flower only can be offered at the
Lotus feet of the Adi Shakti, isn’t it?

49:57.215 --> 50:00.384
May God bless you.

50:14.001 --> 50:17.211
May God bless you.
