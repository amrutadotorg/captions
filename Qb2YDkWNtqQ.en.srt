1
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,680
We read like mad,

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,440
we listen to people like mad,

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:22,760
we like those who give us feed for our mental being.

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,280
They're so mental, so argumentative,

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,080
think no end of their intelligence,

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,440
that you have to just say, “All right, namaskar.”

7
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,680
You can't fight their mental attitude.

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,920
That's why Christ

9
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,320
is to be worshipped

10
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,280
by people who are so very mental.

11
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,760
And this mental nonsense has given

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,280
such a sense of superiority to people.

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,680
“Oh, whatever we do, what's wrong? What's wrong?”

14
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,680
They cannot correct themselves

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,680
because unless and until you cross this limit of mental being,

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,840
you cannot see yourself.

17
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,520
You cannot introspect . You cannot see yourself.

18
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,760
You'll see others, “These Sahaja Yogis are like this,

19
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,280
Sahaja Yoga is like that,” all kinds of things.

20
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,000
But you can't see yourself,

21
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,080
because the whole thing is mental.

22
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:53,080
This mental attitude should be completely curbed

23
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,920
through the help of our Lord Jesus Christ.

24
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,080
But He's also mental,

25
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,920
in your brains Christ is also mental, now what to do?

26
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,920
The One who broke the mental attitude is also a mental -

27
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,440
you have made Him into mental, like a statue

28
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,760
of stone.

29
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,080
So, firstly we have to tell ourselves,

30
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,680
“Now don't think, don't think, don't think, don't think.”

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,520
Four times,

32
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,600
and then you can rise above.

33
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,000
And this is very important.

34
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:50,000
In meditation you have to go beyond the mind.

35
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,680
And thanks to Christ that He’s sitting at the Agnya

36
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,440
to finish off this nonsense of mental being.

37
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,520
I think people should stop reading also perhaps, maybe.

38
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,080
Even My lecture becomes mental, what to do?

39
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,680
I mean everything goes into their head becomes mental, somehow.

40
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,680
And then they ask Me questions, “Mother, did You say it this way,

41
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,280
what did You -” I said, “I said it to make you thoughtless.

42
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,680
Just to stun you,

43
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:36,680
I didn’t say this to sit down and analyze and do, no, no.

44
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:44,080
I said this that you become absolutely shocked and stunned.”

45
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,520
So the best thing for all of you is

46
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,680
to become thoughtless.

47
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,080
That’s the blessing of Christ,

48
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,840
that’s what He worked it out for you.

49
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,000
And I am sure,

50
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,680
if you work it out that don’t pay attention to others.

51
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,840
Don’t react,

52
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,200
just don’t react.

53
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,680
Everything they will see, they’ll react.

54
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,000
What is the need?

55
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,280
What is the use?

56
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,200
What are you going to do with that reaction?

57
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,520
This reaction creates nothing but ripples of thoughts

58
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,000
in your mind, I’ve told you hundreds of times.

59
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,200
And now you have to become

60
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,080
absolutely thoughtless

61
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,440
after this puja.

62
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,840
If that happens, I think we have achieved a lot.

63
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,840
That’s the biggest blessing that Christ has given you,

64
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,080
which you should really enjoy.

65
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:20,080
Then only this Akash Tattwa in you will work.

66
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,680
And how it works?

67
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,680
Through your attention,

68
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,080
it works with Me as you know.

69
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,160
With My attention I work out many things.

70
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,080
How?

71
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,680
Just My attention has become thoughtless,

72
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,920
just thoughtless.

73
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,440
It goes wherever it goes, it works.

74
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,600
But if you put your attention for thought all the time

75
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,520
for thinking,

76
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,840
then it doesn’t do the work that it has supposed to do.

77
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,160
Attention works marvelously

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,680
if you are thoughtless, otherwise it doesn’t.

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,440
So it has to rise from your own self.

80
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,840
Then from others

81
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,840
to the higher level of humanity,

82
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,000
where you are in communication with the sky,

83
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,000
with, we can call it as the

84
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:44,160
tanmatra, or the essential, or the essence

85
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,440
of ether.

86
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,680
With ether you can have television, you can have telephone.

87
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,920
It's a miracle otherwise.

88
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,200
But with this tanmatra,

89
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,680
sitting down here

90
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,080
you can do the job.

91
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,680
It works,

92
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,200
just attention works. I know that.

93
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,280
You also know very well.

94
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,920
You don't have to ask Me to put the attention,

95
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,680
you just put the attention and it will work out.

96
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,000
It’s a very important thing that you have got.

97
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,080
I think that is the first thing -

98
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,680
once you have,

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,600
no problem.

100
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,680
But we start manifesting from the earth element.

101
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,680
Then from the agni(fire) element, then from the jala (water) element,

102
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,600
and then we come to tejas (light),

103
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,840
where the face starts shining.

104
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,160
But lastly we get this thoughtless awareness

105
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,760
by which our attention is absolutely free to do

106
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,360
some special work.

107
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,680
But if you are all the time thinking,

108
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,200
then poor this attention

109
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,520
is so busy, you know, so very busy.

110
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,760
You don't have to ask Me then,

111
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,080
"Mother, please pay attention." You can pay attention,

112
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,920
and you can work it out.

113
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:42,360
In this attention, you don't feel

114
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,680
what you've got, what you are standing,

115
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:52,520
what you are wearing, what others are doing - no, nothing.

116
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,680
You are one with yourself.

117
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,680
And it's a life full of humor.

118
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,680
So much humor.

119
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,080
So much of joy.

120
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,280
So much of happiness

121
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,600
that you don't care for anything

122
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,760
that normally people care for.

123
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,080
So,

124
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:31,760
as it is now Sahaja Yoga has worked in so many countries.

125
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,680
I'm so very proud of you, very proud.

126
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,680
And now it is also going to African countries,

127
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,080
is a very great satisfaction for Me.

128
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,680
And you all can do it;

129
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,680
you all can work it out.

130
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:57,680
Only thing, become thoughtlessly aware,

131
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,200
as the blessing of Christ.

132
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,680
If it works,

133
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:09,360
you will be absolutely enjoying yourself.

134
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,360
So may God bless you.
