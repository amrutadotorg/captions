00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:32.071
 Sorry I am late, my granddaughter is
a little sick and I stayed back to make her better.

00:03:33.121 --> 00:03:40.276
 First I will speak in English and then in Hindi.

00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:52.176
Today we are going to worship Raja Lakshmi,

00:03:54.333 --> 00:04:02.345
means the Goddess which rules the kings.

00:04:08.826 --> 00:04:19.607
It's a very important thing today to understand
that something has basically gone wrong

00:04:21.272 --> 00:04:27.909
in the working of our political systems

00:04:32.182 --> 00:04:47.848
and why the people have lost their sense of justice,

00:04:49.015 --> 00:04:53.574
fair play and the benevolence of the people.

00:04:54.882 --> 00:04:59.991
Where have we gone wrong that this is being lost?

00:05:04.609 --> 00:05:06.880
It's not only in India,

00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:14.198
it's not only in Japan or in England

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:22.369
or any other place where we think there is democracy.

00:05:34.217 --> 00:05:44.887
First and foremost thing is that all these
countries, even those who have got their freedom,

00:05:47.271 --> 00:05:54.517
started following those countries which were
supposed to be highty (sic) and mighty

00:05:54.707 --> 00:06:02.042
and very powerful. Like America, like Russia,
like China, England,

00:06:06.595 --> 00:06:17.546
without understanding how far they have reached in delivering the
goods that they are supposed to do.

00:06:21.976 --> 00:06:32.973
In any case in a country like England, you see the monarchy,
the way it has been working is shocking,

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:44.600
 absolutely shocking. The way
they have acted towards their ministers

00:06:44.792 --> 00:06:55.879
like Cromwell, you feel as if some primitive people
are trying to manage something.

00:06:57.661 --> 00:07:06.784
so cruel, the Queens so cruel, so character-less,so irresponsible.

00:07:06.911 --> 00:07:14.054
They had no character to be Kings and Queens.

00:07:19.771 --> 00:07:26.771
There was no surrendering
to the Raja Lakshmi principle of one's being.

00:07:30.353 --> 00:07:38.248
Then of course, it became independent. And
even now I find such stupid things they're doing.

00:07:40.353 --> 00:07:52.511
Even in France the President has a keep, they run after money,
little money here and there.

00:07:54.432 --> 00:08:02.212
There are people in every country
who are really of very, very low level and

00:08:02.462 --> 00:08:08.512
who are trying to look after the welfare of
the people.

00:08:13.904 --> 00:08:19.629
Also if you read the history of Samurai and
all those people in Japan you are shocked,

00:08:20.854 --> 00:08:25.479
they thought no end of themselves, they had
no connection with the public and the way they behaved.

00:08:27.732 --> 00:08:32.766
Then you go to the communist countries also the same sort of thing.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:44.752
There also those who came in power
became really like despotic rulers.

00:08:46.596 --> 00:08:53.237
Then we have on the other side
Mr. Hitler who came thinking no end of himself.

00:08:54.489 --> 00:09:01.489
Spain, as you know was ruined by Franco.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:07.183
One cannot understand how these people without any character,

00:09:07.944 --> 00:09:18.401
without anyhigher qualities than the rest of the people can
look after their well-being. Impossible!

00:09:26.091 --> 00:09:31.937
I should say in our own country we had great Kings, very great,

00:09:33.078 --> 00:09:44.306
because our heritage is great and
we had saints who really ruled the Kings,

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:51.251
 like Shivaji had a guru who was a great saint, everybody.

00:09:52.641 --> 00:09:59.664
Janaka had a guru, everybody had a guru.
Even Shri Rama had a guru.

00:10:00.754 --> 00:10:10.583
But they were real gurus. They were the people
who really lived the life of saints,

00:10:10.701 --> 00:10:15.851
they were real saints, inside, outside.

00:10:16.193 --> 00:10:28.976
And the people also accepted
the kings who had spiritual background.

00:10:30.509 --> 00:10:34.969
Those who respected spiritual people.

00:10:35.745 --> 00:10:43.074
So, the whole trend in this country was very, very different till
sometime.

00:10:45.394 --> 00:10:52.663
 I don't know when the English came what happened to them.

00:10:53.632 --> 00:10:56.870
 The majority of the people didn't like

00:10:57.116 --> 00:11:04.584
the way the English were living, their style,
their methods, they didn't appreciate.

00:11:05.693 --> 00:11:12.693
But these Kings and Queens of different states
they started feeling that

00:11:13.711 --> 00:11:18.500
they are very sophisticated people
and we should have their culture.

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:24.923
And so many of these Queens, the modern ones who smoke,
who drink,

00:11:26.309 --> 00:11:36.579
tell Me that it was taught by their governess who came either
from Sweden or from England or from Australia.

00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:47.571
And they picked up these things. Of course the men
also thought that we are very backward,

00:11:47.633 --> 00:11:52.555
you see, that's the idea they gave them,
"You are very backward people,

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:58.862
you don't know how to smoke, you don't know how to drink,
you have no ballroom dancing," this that.

00:11:58.997 --> 00:12:04.973
Even our military got corrupted with it. In the
military

00:12:05.324 --> 00:12:08.272
is all English style things still going on.

00:12:08.796 --> 00:12:14.056
I don't know when will they stop.
They don't know anything about our own country.

00:12:14.328 --> 00:12:20.311
They'll know about England, and you ask them
anything about England they'll know.

00:12:20.608 --> 00:12:28.260
The whole education system came through English,
but all about England and western life

00:12:28.469 --> 00:12:35.625
than about Indian life. Nobody
ever cared for Indian things, you see.

00:12:38.336 --> 00:12:46.273
Even in medicine same thing happened.
Nobody wanted to listen to any Vaidya or anyone.

00:12:46.381 --> 00:12:51.535
They thought oh, these are useless primitive people, backward.

00:12:56.087 --> 00:13:01.875
So even one country, which was really,
I should say, had spirituality

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:11.002
ruling in the politics also went down like
this.

00:13:12.841 --> 00:13:22.642
Before independence in this country I remember
we had to fight the British,

00:13:24.372 --> 00:13:28.933
and what patriotism people had at that time.

00:13:30.402 --> 00:13:35.394
I remember once we had gone to see a hockey match,

00:13:36.048 --> 00:13:43.304
and My father always had a national flag on it, that time
it was not national it was congress flag in the car.

00:13:43.947 --> 00:13:47.606
 So the soldiers came, they said, "Take down this flag."

00:13:48.273 --> 00:13:54.350
So My driver got down he said," You cut my
throat first and then you take down the flag".

00:13:55.033 --> 00:14:02.572
We all children joined him and they were shocked, went back.

00:14:05.251 --> 00:14:10.640
Such enthusiasm, such patriotism

00:14:11.251 --> 00:14:15.749
came at that time when we were fighting these people.

00:14:20.491 --> 00:14:28.750
But they divided us and created a problem for us. And you
know before we could enjoy any fruits of our freedom,

00:14:29.294 --> 00:14:36.294
we were fighting, we were divided.

00:14:37.789 --> 00:14:44.793
 I don't know whom to blame for that.
If we had not accepted this division,

00:14:46.533 --> 00:14:52.830
there would have been no problem. But they accepted it.

00:14:53.366 --> 00:14:57.458
Now, poor Bangladeshi's are so,  so, so poor.

00:14:59.006 --> 00:15:02.009
If they were one with India, they would have been much better.

00:15:02.555 --> 00:15:07.297
And whatis Pakistan? It's just an empty place you know,

00:15:08.073 --> 00:15:14.301
no industries, nothing. That's why they are all the time
talking about Kashmir, Kashmir they have nothing else.

00:15:14.808 --> 00:15:21.808
Their own country people are having fights, this that, but that's,
there's no growth.

00:15:22.472 --> 00:15:27.366
Now they cut out only this India.

00:15:28.287 --> 00:15:38.002
Now here after all this happening,
you know any war, any kind of crisis like that,

00:15:38.339 --> 00:15:42.596
 immediately changes the value system.

00:15:43.378 --> 00:15:47.178
Not that in the west there were no value systems, there were,

00:15:47.352 --> 00:15:52.424
but the war completely changed them in the same way in India also.

00:15:53.447 --> 00:16:04.259
Politicians, those who lost their lives in the fights,
or those who stood for something good

00:16:06.451 --> 00:16:13.693
were regarded as no ideal. And people
took a U-turn, absolutely a U-turn

00:16:14.412 --> 00:16:17.733
and they became very self-centered,

00:16:18.098 --> 00:16:23.723
only worried about their own personal things,
their families, or maybe...

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:33.168
accumulation of money and transferring
of money from here to Switzerland. I mean

00:16:33.287 --> 00:16:39.811
something, I mean I tell you I've gone through
My life with the people who were fighting,

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:47.650
fighting for freedom. I mean they could not
even think of these things.

00:16:48.547 --> 00:16:56.254
I know My father, I know My mother, I know their friends, I
know so many people who were in our family

00:16:56.469 --> 00:17:02.860
used to come, so many Sikhs and so many other
people, Muslims even.

00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:07.524
They could not think

00:17:07.828 --> 00:17:14.241
taking any money, I mean  it was really regarded as very low-level.

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:25.450
For what to take? of

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:37.228
What is the need? If you are satisfied in your heart of what
you wanted, you got, you've got your freedom, now finished.

00:17:38.419 --> 00:17:44.216
But how these people who were absolutely at the bottom,

00:17:44.401 --> 00:17:50.322
who did nothing for the country,
sacrificed nothing for the country,

00:17:50.747 --> 00:17:55.780
 just came up on top and all the good people went down.

00:18:04.001 --> 00:18:12.053
If you read the history of Shivaji, Rana Pratap,
or any of them Shalivahana anyone,

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:22.370
you'll be surprised how they used to worship Shakti.
All the Kshatriyas used to worship Shakti,

00:18:25.363 --> 00:18:30.179
and they would go up to a point and not beyond.

00:18:30.426 --> 00:18:35.823
Up to the point till the dharma was there.
That history I cannot repeat it to you.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:43.582
But in a subtle way one feels that this partition suddenly

00:18:44.176 --> 00:18:52.301
changed the attitude of people,

00:18:52.723 --> 00:18:56.981
or I should say those who were very low-levelthey came up.

00:19:00.843 --> 00:19:04.441
I remember I was here at that time, partition time,

00:19:05.576 --> 00:19:15.781
and I was married and three people came to Me.

00:19:15.846 --> 00:19:23.750
 I was sitting outside in the garden,
knitting something for My child because I was pregnant.

00:19:24.673 --> 00:19:31.570
So they came, and they looked at Me and they
said, "Can we have one room in your house?"

00:19:33.336 --> 00:19:38.807
I said, "Why not, I've got it. It's a very
big house of My father.

00:19:39.002 --> 00:19:44.029
I'll give it to you."They said, "We need for one
or two months. We are refugees."

00:19:44.409 --> 00:19:52.033
"All right, and it has an outside door, you
need not bother us and there's also kitchen

00:19:52.221 --> 00:19:56.128
attached and a bathroom attached. You can do whatever you like."

00:19:56.336 --> 00:20:01.622
 Just I offered. In the evening My brother came,

00:20:02.223 --> 00:20:08.022
elder brother and My husband and both of them were friends and

00:20:08.816 --> 00:20:13.096
they just started shouting at Me,
these people were in the other room.

00:20:13.674 --> 00:20:18.793
"What do you mean by keeping such people? Who are they?
What will they do?" and this and that.

00:20:19.071 --> 00:20:20.793
I said, "What will they do?

00:20:23.349 --> 00:20:25.418
They may steal something from Me.

00:20:25.484 --> 00:20:36.172
So what is there in this house to steal? They are refugees,
look nicepeople. To Me, I have approved them

00:20:36.503 --> 00:20:38.844
because of vibrations they're all right."

00:20:39.092 --> 00:20:42.567
"No, no, no, no, no better throw them away!"

00:20:44.375 --> 00:20:50.521
I said, "Look at these people, without even
talking to them, knowing them, suddenly

00:20:50.721 --> 00:20:56.921
you are asking them to get out only because they are refugees."

00:20:58.588 --> 00:21:06.815
Then I did feel that in this country a new
wave had started, that a person is not respected

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:16.394
if he has no money, he's not trusted if you
have no money. Actually it is the other way round

00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:19.528
those who have money, you better never trust them.

00:21:21.402 --> 00:21:25.312
And those who don't have money
are much more honest people in this country

00:21:25.368 --> 00:21:29.084
 than the people who have money, who are all cheats practically.

00:21:33.331 --> 00:21:40.665
So it happened like this and I said, "No they
are going to stay here," I put down My foot.

00:21:41.617 --> 00:21:45.387
I said, "This house My father has given Me

00:21:45.887 --> 00:21:48.519
and they are going to stay here."

00:21:50.815 --> 00:21:53.401
Poor things they stayed for a month

00:21:53.567 --> 00:21:55.698
in a very, I think,

00:21:56.999 --> 00:21:59.261
must be very much embarrassed.

00:22:00.462 --> 00:22:03.969
And while they were there

00:22:04.472 --> 00:22:09.798
so many Sikhs, that time it was
a big organization - Sikhs and RSS were one,

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:12.661
and they came to My house

00:22:12.923 --> 00:22:17.244
and said, "We have heard there is
a Muslim staying with you." There was a Muslim.

00:22:18.936 --> 00:22:21.776
"And we're going to kill that Muslim."

00:22:23.111 --> 00:22:24.048
I said,

00:22:24.209 --> 00:22:27.502
"What makes you think
there's a Muslim?"  "We've got reports."

00:22:27.876 --> 00:22:34.230
I said, "Wrong, there is
no Muslim in the house." I told him a lie.

00:22:37.422 --> 00:22:38.741
So they said,

00:22:39.217 --> 00:22:43.708
" How are we to believe you?"
I said, "See I'm wearing this thing.

00:22:45.144 --> 00:22:49.247
I am a Hindu lady. How will I keep a Muslim in my house?

00:22:49.982 --> 00:22:51.929
We're all frightened of them

00:22:53.792 --> 00:22:56.191
and there's no one like that."

00:22:56.888 --> 00:23:01.848
Somehow or other they believed Me.
I told a complete lie but they believed Me.

00:23:03.314 --> 00:23:06.933
They had brought lots of those

00:23:08.209 --> 00:23:11.681
swords with blood.

00:23:12.525 --> 00:23:15.134
But I was not afraid and I told them

00:23:15.285 --> 00:23:17.956
in a very determined manner.

00:23:20.153 --> 00:23:27.111
Anybody else in My place would have said,
"All right, all right there is one you can take away."

00:23:31.947 --> 00:23:37.630
Then these three persons who were there left My house

00:23:38.327 --> 00:23:42.275
and one of them is a very famous actress,

00:23:43.878 --> 00:23:47.141
another one is a very famous poet

00:23:47.236 --> 00:23:51.239
and another one is a very, very famous writer.

00:23:53.217 --> 00:23:56.039
And it so happened that

00:23:56.571 --> 00:24:00.533
they wanted to make a film about young people

00:24:01.065 --> 00:24:05.150
and I was the chairman of that, vice chairman of that,

00:24:06.342 --> 00:24:09.247
and they wanted to call this actress.

00:24:10.119 --> 00:24:12.067
I said, "Don't tellher My name."

00:24:12.238 --> 00:24:14.559
Because I had lost her completely.

00:24:15.473 --> 00:24:18.614
I'd just said, "Let it be wherever they are, let them be.

00:24:18.971 --> 00:24:22.691
"There's no sort of - I never made any enquiries or anything.

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:25.234
"Don't tell them My name."

00:24:26.794 --> 00:24:27.825
They said "Why?"

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:31.210
I said, "For some reason you just don't tell her My name,

00:24:32.141 --> 00:24:35.997
otherwise she'll be compelled to say yes, which I don't want."

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:39.116
So when they went to her and asked her,

00:24:39.927 --> 00:24:45.559
she said, "I must get a sari,
I must get a chappal, I must get a purse to match,

00:24:45.797 --> 00:24:49.913
I must get this, all this you have to pay,
plus so much money you'll have to pay."

00:24:50.141 --> 00:24:53.536
They said, "Ours is a charitable." She said, "Whatever it is."

00:24:54.544 --> 00:24:57.506
I said, "All right, give her whatever she
asks for ."

00:24:58.615 --> 00:25:01.374
Then I went for the opening ceremony

00:25:03.178 --> 00:25:05.178
and she saw Me

00:25:05.857 --> 00:25:11.637
and she couldn't control herself,
tears started rolling down. Just came and fell at My feet.

00:25:12.182 --> 00:25:17.032
She said, "How are you here after such a long time?"

00:25:18.498 --> 00:25:22.204
So they said, "She's the one who's making this film."
"What?

00:25:23.829 --> 00:25:29.960
She's making this film,
why didn't you tell me? My God, my God."

00:25:30.488 --> 00:25:34.764
She couldn't help it, she was crying,
crying, crying, crying. I said, "Now it's all right."

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:36.981
She said, "You take money from me.

00:25:37.349 --> 00:25:42.339
I'll pay for the whole making of the film.
You don't know this lady. You don't know her.

00:25:42.846 --> 00:25:46.646
What She's done for me, nobody would do she had done."

00:25:48.061 --> 00:25:51.558
She said, "She never told us anything how
are we to know?"

00:25:52.856 --> 00:25:57.170
Such a change that she immediately telephoned her husband

00:25:57.447 --> 00:26:01.266
and to this great poet, they all came running and they all saw.

00:26:01.964 --> 00:26:04.884
But a small good gesture

00:26:06.407 --> 00:26:08.407
of administration,

00:26:08.947 --> 00:26:13.588
that was My house given to Me by My father.

00:26:15.391 --> 00:26:19.450
That time of course My husband and My brother

00:26:19.624 --> 00:26:23.967
didn't know how to trust people.

00:26:27.006 --> 00:26:30.980
But I trusted them, fully.

00:26:33.149 --> 00:26:39.982
They were saying, "They will cut your throat."
Why? Why will they cut My throat? For what?

00:26:41.095 --> 00:26:43.978
All kinds of funny things they were thinking.

00:26:44.486 --> 00:26:50.890
And the worst thing I felt was they
were afraid because they had no money.

00:26:54.624 --> 00:26:58.496
That is the beginning of the end, I think.

00:26:59.955 --> 00:27:05.341
In our country this struggle for money started after that.

00:27:07.989 --> 00:27:11.932
Without money people started suffering very much.

00:27:12.835 --> 00:27:19.710
Poor people don't mind because they are used to it.
Whatever money they have, they eat and sleep off.

00:27:20.612 --> 00:27:24.543
There were not also very, very poor people as they are today

00:27:24.947 --> 00:27:27.335
but they were poor people no doubt.

00:27:28.157 --> 00:27:31.396
But what I realized at that moment,

00:27:32.118 --> 00:27:36.799
that the people who have any position

00:27:37.129 --> 00:27:44.129
or any power or anything are
literally frightened of everybody else.

00:27:47.027 --> 00:27:51.202
This is the beginning of our downfall.

00:27:53.337 --> 00:27:55.795
We got frightened.

00:27:57.327 --> 00:28:00.743
Those who were in charge got frightened

00:28:01.426 --> 00:28:10.247
that I may lose my seat or
I may lose my money, I may lose my power.

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:17.023
That fright kept them absolutely mad.

00:28:18.236 --> 00:28:22.353
Supposing I am left with no money. So what? What happens?

00:28:25.562 --> 00:28:32.562
All these thoughts started coming
after that partition, I felt it's everywhere.

00:28:35.348 --> 00:28:37.573
While I'll tell you in My childhood,

00:28:37.946 --> 00:28:42.468
My father never used to lock the house,
it was a very big house he never use to lock.

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:47.521
And we had a very beautiful gramophone
will all that horn sort of a thing.

00:28:49.093 --> 00:28:53.450
And one day one thief came and stole that.

00:28:56.060 --> 00:29:01.045
So next day we discovered, My father said,

00:29:01.467 --> 00:29:04.308
"Poor thing, he was fond of music

00:29:04.637 --> 00:29:09.168
so he's taken away doesn't matter,
but he didn't take the records now what will he

00:29:09.469 --> 00:29:11.469
use, he must have records."

00:29:12.092 --> 00:29:15.407
So My Mother started teasing him, "All right you advertise now.

00:29:15.854 --> 00:29:22.830
The one who has stolen our gramophone
should come and take the records they are available for him."

00:29:24.359 --> 00:29:26.359
It's so natural you know.

00:29:27.549 --> 00:29:29.932
He just felt we have money after all.

00:29:30.329 --> 00:29:32.329
This fellow doesn't have money

00:29:33.138 --> 00:29:38.358
and he wants to listen to music you see.

00:29:39.425 --> 00:29:46.670
 So My father said, "All right." Otherwise
he was a criminal lawyer My father knew law very well.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:49.394
Was not a stupid fool

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:57.015
but he couldn't understand this fellow has
only taken gramophone only without the records.

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:04.375
He said, "he must not have found it, you see it was there kept
and all that." My Mother said, "You better advertise it."

00:30:08.852 --> 00:30:11.724
He was a politician also.

00:30:12.755 --> 00:30:19.155
So that time, the feeling among the politician was to

00:30:19.493 --> 00:30:24.349
how to raise the standard of these people who are

00:30:25.317 --> 00:30:27.931
not having what we are having.

00:30:32.011 --> 00:30:34.946
All the people who had money

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:38.736
donated lavishly to so many things.

00:30:40.681 --> 00:30:45.339
I mean in My place there was one Rahbahadur Laxminarayan,

00:30:45.758 --> 00:30:53.153
Most of the things that he donated
all his money, everything to a big university.

00:30:53.875 --> 00:30:59.513
happened in those days were done by charity people.

00:31:00.786 --> 00:31:04.277
I mean they never thought our children should have so much money,

00:31:04.609 --> 00:31:07.880
crores and crores and crores, they never thought like that.

00:31:09.225 --> 00:31:13.643
Whatever limited money they had they wanted to donate

00:31:15.326 --> 00:31:17.851
and do something good for others.

00:31:18.346 --> 00:31:20.227
So when the Raja Lakshmi,

00:31:21.624 --> 00:31:25.732
Lakshmi that is the one responsible

00:31:26.387 --> 00:31:32.865
for looking after the benevolence
of the people, when She acts people think

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:35.173
that they have,

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:41.795
not even think they do it automatically,
that they are there forbenevolence.

00:31:44.947 --> 00:31:49.749
They don't have to tell themselves, it's just that they feel that

00:31:50.247 --> 00:31:54.640
it is their job, this is what they have to do,

00:31:55.133 --> 00:32:01.036
is to look after the people they are
to be brought to better levels of life.

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:06.476
This is what they think, they don't think like party politics,

00:32:08.204 --> 00:32:12.813
who is coming up, whom to kill, nothing of the kind.

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:23.861
Under the influence of the Goddess of Lakshmi, which rules

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:28.732
the political side, we can say the kingdoms and all that,

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:34.667
first thing is generosity.

00:32:37.532 --> 00:32:39.854
First thing is generosity.

00:32:40.841 --> 00:32:45.664
For example, Mahavira was meditating

00:32:45.871 --> 00:32:51.964
and while coming out His cloth - He had one
cloth around His body, dhoti and He had covered himself.

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:56.561
And the upper cloth just got

00:32:57.157 --> 00:32:59.339
caught up in the bushes.

00:32:59.827 --> 00:33:04.247
So he cut it out and came out
with half the cloth. It was in His own palace.

00:33:08.378 --> 00:33:11.744
So Shri Krishna wanted to take His test.

00:33:12.202 --> 00:33:16.259
He said, "See I have no clothes, I'm just naked."

00:33:16.533 --> 00:33:20.255
He came before Him like a beggar. "You have this,

00:33:20.955 --> 00:33:26.065
why don't you give Me this cloth?
You can go to your palace and wear your dress."

00:33:26.855 --> 00:33:29.751
He said, "All right." He took it out and gave it  to him.

00:33:33.175 --> 00:33:34.997
And then He got some

00:33:35.408 --> 00:33:39.566
leaves and all that, covered Himself,
went to His palace and got dressed.

00:33:40.034 --> 00:33:42.034
But now these Jains, you know,

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:44.476
they make His

00:33:44.643 --> 00:33:54.035
statue so big, insult Him completely
by showing all kinds of nonsensical private parts to the details.

00:34:01.864 --> 00:34:08.945
This is what is, where you have no worshipping of the Goddess.

00:34:10.612 --> 00:34:15.392
Goddess is Shri Shobha, She's the One

00:34:16.243 --> 00:34:19.459
who decorates you. She's a mother.

00:34:21.596 --> 00:34:28.212
She decorates you with ornaments,
She decorates you with beautiful clothes, She's your mother.

00:34:28.905 --> 00:34:30.525
She does it.

00:34:31.709 --> 00:34:33.880
Like Raja Janaka,

00:34:34.036 --> 00:34:38.414
He was the king, so he had to wear

00:34:39.462 --> 00:34:44.744
ornaments, he had to wear
beautiful clothes, He had to do everything.

00:34:45.457 --> 00:34:47.540
And when Nachiketa went to Him

00:34:47.964 --> 00:34:54.621
he was quite surprised that why my guru has sent him to
this King who is wearing all kind of dresses and this and that

00:34:54.959 --> 00:34:59.285
and he also had a big function of dancing and this.

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:07.620
He said, "He's not a saint so why my guru touches His feet? He's
a king."

00:35:09.584 --> 00:35:15.015
Of course Raja Janaka knew what he was thinking about.

00:35:16.513 --> 00:35:19.039
He said, "Why have you come here Nachiketa?"

00:35:19.331 --> 00:35:24.254
He said, "I'm here to get my Self Realization."

00:35:26.125 --> 00:35:30.770
He said, "You can take all My kingdom but
not easy to give you Self Realization."

00:35:32.123 --> 00:35:39.987
He said, "All right, whatever you say I'll do."

00:35:40.813 --> 00:35:48.924
So He put a big sword on his head and asked
him to sleep. He couldn't sleep at all.

00:35:52.446 --> 00:35:55.904
Then they were having a bath,
he said, "Come and have bath in the river."

00:35:56.457 --> 00:36:01.707
People came and told that
there's fire and everybody is running away

00:36:02.972 --> 00:36:07.448
and Raja Janaka was in His meditative mood, He was just sitting
quietly.

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.582
Nachiketa got a little upset.

00:36:11.038 --> 00:36:15.274
Then they said, "The fire is coming here
and all these cloths are going to be burnt."

00:36:15.797 --> 00:36:21.244
So Nachiketa ran out to save his things but still

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:27.417
He was meditating. Then they came out

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:34.733
and Nachiketa found that nothing that was burnt was there.

00:36:35.021 --> 00:36:38.193
It was just an illusion for people.

00:36:39.282 --> 00:36:41.674
He was amazed.

00:36:43.057 --> 00:36:47.089
Then he realized what was wrong with him,

00:36:47.526 --> 00:36:49.526
that he was

00:36:50.364 --> 00:36:53.859
doubting the Divine power Itself.

00:36:54.441 --> 00:36:58.538
The one who was Janaka, who was a King

00:36:58.788 --> 00:37:00.829
was not bothered about His own

00:37:01.179 --> 00:37:05.386
powers, these are what?
Because he is today, this you have to do it.

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:09.687
Because I'm married, I have to wear a Mangal Sutra.

00:37:10.219 --> 00:37:14.061
So this is for the parampara for the tradition style.

00:37:15.033 --> 00:37:21.790
But inside He was a saint,a very high,

00:37:28.263 --> 00:37:31.798
high level of saintliness.

00:37:33.012 --> 00:37:35.091
 When this thing happens

00:37:36.874 --> 00:37:41.372
that you get some position,

00:37:41.706 --> 00:37:45.775
any power, even in Sahaja Yoga I was surprised.

00:37:46.453 --> 00:37:54.361
If somebody becomes leader, I don't know what happens
to him. It is a myth.

00:37:54.737 --> 00:37:58.037
There's nothing like leadership in Sahaja Yoga, nothing like that.

00:37:58.751 --> 00:38:04.286
It's just a myth. But suddenly people jump up.

00:38:09.234 --> 00:38:14.258
It is ego that gets pampered.

00:38:15.543 --> 00:38:22.558
But this ego can be easily managed if you worship the Raja Lakshmi.

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:28.776
She is the giver of balance.

00:38:30.987 --> 00:38:37.019
Firstly, She rides on the elephant.

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:49.639
Is not easy for a lady to climb
on an elephant, I have done it, it's not easy.

00:38:52.074 --> 00:38:57.901
Without fear, She sits straight

00:39:00.311 --> 00:39:05.431
with a complete balanced attitude.

00:39:07.994 --> 00:39:13.255
And Her blessings are tremendous.

00:39:15.281 --> 00:39:26.360
The first blessing one gets, is the imbibment of

00:39:28.144 --> 00:39:34.392
dignity. Dignity of a King, dignity of a Queen.

00:39:34.686 --> 00:39:41.879
You are a Queen so you can't behave like street women.

00:39:47.481 --> 00:39:52.178
With Her blessing first of all you get that dignity.

00:39:53.043 --> 00:40:00.812
That dignity is full of love. Love for others.

00:40:01.996 --> 00:40:09.150
That personality emits nothing
but love and benevolence for others, nothing else.

00:40:13.429 --> 00:40:21.150
Wherever She looks, in every glance She blesses people.

00:40:22.042 --> 00:40:28.906
She doesn't expect anything.
She is a queen, what can you give to the Queen?

00:40:30.058 --> 00:40:35.195
She's the highest of all in every way, what can you give to Her?

00:40:36.146 --> 00:40:43.247
All these politicians and all these so-called
presidents of all these countries are beggars.

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:52.757
All the time give me this, give me this,
like greedy people going around are beggars, they are not

00:40:53.015 --> 00:41:01.248
the people who can rule. Hankering after things.

00:41:04.865 --> 00:41:07.978
So first thing is the sign,

00:41:08.448 --> 00:41:17.912
is that such a person has a personality that
just blesses people, thinks of their benevolence,

00:41:18.348 --> 00:41:30.084
cares for each and every person who comes
along. This is a blessing of the Goddess.

00:41:34.094 --> 00:41:45.426
Then the second blessing of the Goddess is
that you develop a kind of a temperament,

00:41:46.465 --> 00:41:51.670
which is very dignified, but also very humorous

00:41:54.053 --> 00:41:57.602
and understanding what other people are like.

00:42:02.107 --> 00:42:07.748
There's a story of a king who was going on
a horse and he met a drunkard. So you can

00:42:08.065 --> 00:42:14.357
say these our drunkard can be compared to our politicians.

00:42:16.187 --> 00:42:22.002
So the drunkard stopped. He said, "I want to buy your horse."

00:42:22.744 --> 00:42:28.858
People said, "Do you know what he is?" "Yeh I know
he's a King. All right. So what? I want to buy his horse."

00:42:29.755 --> 00:42:34.274
He said, "All right not today,
tomorrow we'll sell the horse to you."

00:42:34.881 --> 00:42:41.060
So went away. Next day he was called.
So he came with folded hands bent down.

00:42:42.254 --> 00:42:49.038
He said, "What, you were the one
who was going to buy my horse, what has happened to you?

00:42:49.284 --> 00:42:50.843
I want to sell it to you."

00:42:51.264 --> 00:43:02.461
He said, "Sir, the one who wanted to buy is
dead. I'm an ordinary person."

00:43:14.499 --> 00:43:22.324
Such a personality, such solid personality I should say,

00:43:22.882 --> 00:43:26.428
that anybody would have been angry,

00:43:26.849 --> 00:43:33.793
would have said beat this man,
throw him away, he talks to me like this, behaves like this.

00:43:37.943 --> 00:43:42.966
What the king said was remarkable.

00:43:43.497 --> 00:43:52.947
Because he knew he's drunk, he knew he's not in his senses,

00:43:55.874 --> 00:44:02.462
that's why he's talking. Didn't get angry with him, he said,
"All right come along tomorrow, I'll sell you the horse."

00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:08.827
That's only possible if you have
this Raja Lakshmi in you otherwise

00:44:09.277 --> 00:44:13.904
you would never behave like this.
Now what about today's politicians anywhere?

00:44:14.982 --> 00:44:18.170
They even shoot people, they kill people,

00:44:18.681 --> 00:44:24.707
they arrest them, they put them into trouble I mean.
All kinds of things they are doing.

00:44:36.067 --> 00:44:40.700
Such people have no right to call anybody as criminals.

00:44:43.561 --> 00:44:45.569
But we accept.

00:44:46.291 --> 00:44:53.164
As in Hindi we say, "Aaj kal ka jamana he aisa hai." We accept it,

00:44:54.362 --> 00:44:57.745
all such people as our gurus.

00:45:01.685 --> 00:45:11.405
Then Raja Lakshmi is the one
who stands on dharma. She stands on dharma.

00:45:13.543 --> 00:45:21.610
If there is some adharmi then she will not bless that person.

00:45:23.206 --> 00:45:25.789
Adharmi is to be taken out.

00:45:31.382 --> 00:45:43.033
But if he's not, then he will go all out to save that person.

00:45:44.021 --> 00:45:50.559
But if he finds he's adharmic he will not.

00:45:52.535 --> 00:46:04.940
It's a kind of a Divine discretion
he should have as to whom to be kind and whom to be punishing.

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:10.816
That divine discretion should be there in a person

00:46:12.698 --> 00:46:21.670
otherwise you can play into the hands of ten people who are around
you, teaching you something, doing something.

00:46:27.196 --> 00:46:37.985
One day I was in My mother's place Nangaon,
and there was one gentleman who impressed our Yogi very much.

00:46:39.103 --> 00:46:46.856
I just kept quite. He was a big politician and

00:46:50.037 --> 00:46:54.797
he told Me, "We have to do like this and we have to do."
I said, "All right, all right, all right."

00:46:55.805 --> 00:47:02.575
Then three, four professors
from the university came to tell Me, "Mother,

00:47:03.383 --> 00:47:09.220
he's a politician, be very careful. He's a very bad man, be careful
about him."

00:47:09.844 --> 00:47:15.233
I said, "What do you know about him?" They said, "He's a
politician." I said, "There are so many politicians."

00:47:15.819 --> 00:47:18.193
"But he's not a good man." "But what do you mean?"

00:47:19.032 --> 00:47:21.365
I said, "Now you sit down and I'll tell you.

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:28.836
This man has eloped with the wife of a Brahmin. He himself is not a
Brahmin

00:47:29.336 --> 00:47:32.138
and this child is from him to him

00:47:33.391 --> 00:47:36.961
and how much he has

00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:43.702
deceived people everything I know. They were shocked.

00:47:48.116 --> 00:47:52.371
"You know Mother?"
"Of course I know him."

00:47:53.759 --> 00:47:58.352
"Then why do You allow him to come close to You?"

00:47:59.955 --> 00:48:12.272
"Do you think he is close to Me?"
I said, "You're sadly mistaken. But it's nice he's come to Me

00:48:12.948 --> 00:48:16.610
because he's been troubling people too much and I'll correct him."

00:48:16.761 --> 00:48:20.332
While some people thought he was a great achievement we have got

00:48:20.619 --> 00:48:26.272
and some of them came to tell Me
to be careful of this man without knowing what he was.

00:48:30.744 --> 00:48:34.897
This kind of a Divine discretion has to be there.

00:48:35.684 --> 00:48:44.998
If a King does not have that
Divine discretion then he can punish the good and he may

00:48:47.784 --> 00:48:57.244
help the bad people. But this Divine discretion
disappears when you are self-centered.

00:48:57.909 --> 00:49:04.906
That's the main point, is a complete detachment about
the power should be there. Complete detachment.

00:49:06.323 --> 00:49:10.855
Why should Raja Lakshmi care for anything? What does She care?

00:49:13.210 --> 00:49:23.542
But now there are some who'll pamper a person with this and that
and then they feel ah ha we're on top of the world.

00:49:25.477 --> 00:49:34.680
They just pamper, pamper and pamper
the ego of a politician and he thinks he is a very big man.

00:49:36.679 --> 00:49:41.699
Then in the election he doesn't
understand why he's on the ground.

00:49:44.824 --> 00:49:53.318
So with this self-dignity, self-knowledge, you know what you are.

00:49:55.271 --> 00:50:00.893
Whatever you may tell Me, whatever
you may say to Me, I'll listen, all right all right all right,

00:50:02.267 --> 00:50:08.251
but I don't accept anything as something great.

00:50:10.406 --> 00:50:14.840
Because if I am that, what is there to be great?

00:50:16.503 --> 00:50:27.415
Now supposing this is a lamp here.
So is it great or not great? It is a lamp.

00:50:30.529 --> 00:50:40.962
So if I'm Adi Shakti, I'm Adi Shakti,
so what? If you are a king you are a king so what?

00:50:42.068 --> 00:50:46.017
I mean, if you're an impostor then you might feel your ego

00:50:46.748 --> 00:50:50.844
but if you are really the King then you won't feel.

00:50:53.146 --> 00:51:05.351
If you are under the influence
of the Goddess then that is the only thing you enjoy.

00:51:07.362 --> 00:51:19.311
The rest of it is nothing. Whether you have diamonds or you
have silver or you have anything makes no difference at all.

00:51:26.701 --> 00:51:35.427
Now how people misuse the scriptures also
one should see. That Raja Lakshmi is sitting

00:51:35.590 --> 00:51:42.590
on the elephant all right,
so they should have all very big cars, you see.

00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:48.465
She is sitting on the elephant because
elephant is the highest animal,

00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:56.222
is very kind, very forgiving and
has such a tremendous memory.

00:51:56.847 --> 00:52:02.168
That's why She's sitting on an elephant.

00:52:04.943 --> 00:52:09.804
She's not sitting there to show off,

00:52:12.027 --> 00:52:17.200
but She's sitting there to see around, what is happening

00:52:17.541 --> 00:52:24.541
avalokan, She can see around
what is happening, to be at a higher place.

00:52:28.815 --> 00:52:38.271
That's why a King is made to sit
on a higher pedestal. But the purpose is not to show off.

00:52:39.343 --> 00:52:44.017
But the purpose is that from that state

00:52:44.739 --> 00:52:52.168
he can see others better, he can be watchful of others.

00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:11.565
If somebody gets a high position
then they think they are the owners of that position.

00:53:13.611 --> 00:53:24.733
This has all come because the brain has gone
upside down I think. How can it be logically?

00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:40.518
Now if you are this throne is given,
all right, so with the throne I sit on this, but this throne

00:53:41.834 --> 00:53:48.834
cannot give Me anything,
I can give something to this throne.

00:53:51.926 --> 00:53:58.980
The King has to think he is obliging
all these things that he is sitting on them because he is a King.

00:53:59.611 --> 00:54:06.174
On the contrary he thinks all these things
are important because something is lacking in him or what?

00:54:08.834 --> 00:54:14.942
And that's why when they come to do Raj they start

00:54:15.298 --> 00:54:19.429
gathering things which are useless absolutely, clutter up their

00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:25.303
houses, homes, everything with something that is useless.

00:54:26.256 --> 00:54:32.431
All their dignity, everything, is itself a decoration on them

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:39.696
and to show that they're Kings of course they are given a crown,

00:54:42.057 --> 00:54:46.613
they are given a big necklace,
they have to wear something here because they are Kings.

00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:50.513
But these are

00:54:52.369 --> 00:54:58.950
not actually his decorations but
these things get decorated by a King.

00:55:00.479 --> 00:55:12.527
For example, you get some lanky panky fellow
from the street, half starved, who is a beggar, say for example,

00:55:13.576 --> 00:55:23.684
and put those ornaments on him and
all the dresses of a King. Put him on the stage,

00:55:24.099 --> 00:55:32.070
everybody will start laughing.
Nobody will think that he is a King by any chance.

00:55:33.409 --> 00:55:38.055
Because he doesn't have that dignity,
doesn't have that face, he doesn't have that body,

00:55:38.261 --> 00:55:42.488
he doesn't have that mind, he doesn't have that wisdom.

00:55:44.147 --> 00:55:48.406
So how is he a King? Like, there was one King

00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:54.411
who tried to make his shoes of pearls.

00:55:55.998 --> 00:56:02.750
But he was so stupid looking,
you know, that when I saw the pearls I said,

00:56:03.344 --> 00:56:08.399
"This is the man only who can
think like this." So stupid it is to look at.

00:56:09.038 --> 00:56:15.166
I was so - of these pearls being put on his shoes.

00:56:16.906 --> 00:56:21.822
So there are many such things
these days all of these stupid people are doing.

00:56:22.841 --> 00:56:30.814
There are big, big cartoons coming
out and you can see for yourself how stupidly they live.

00:56:31.802 --> 00:56:34.479
To Me it's such a difference I tell you,

00:56:37.922 --> 00:56:43.448
such a difference. To them all these things are so important,

00:56:47.322 --> 00:56:51.392
which if they don't have they'll buy and put it.

00:56:54.542 --> 00:56:59.384
I know of a gentleman who came with a garland

00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:08.088
to our program, I mean to our dinner.
I asked him, "Why are you carrying the garland?"

00:57:08.584 --> 00:57:14.120
"See after all you see I was garlanded so I'm keeping the garland."

00:57:14.782 --> 00:57:20.836
We didn't know what to do. We Indians
will never take a garland, first of all, anybody gives you

00:57:21.414 --> 00:57:25.746
they'll put it, except for the Gods.
They will take it out immediately.

00:57:26.322 --> 00:57:32.511
Another lady who came to see Me and she said, "I don't
understand these Indians, I bought a garland,

00:57:32.718 --> 00:57:36.317
I put it in my neck so they were all laughing on the street at me."

00:57:39.153 --> 00:57:48.656
You Indians understand how subtle it is,
just see, that you can't put garland, you're not God.

00:57:49.474 --> 00:57:53.895
You cannot buy a garland and put it in your neck and walk out.

00:57:54.086 --> 00:57:56.818
Innately you have to be that.

00:58:00.695 --> 00:58:08.258
So the person who is innately a King
has the blessings of the Raja Lakshmi.

00:58:11.131 --> 00:58:16.633
Then what does She do? What does She do to such a man?

00:58:18.577 --> 00:58:32.632
What She does is first his name is written on the hearts of
the people whom he rules. She writes it with her own hands.

00:58:38.095 --> 00:58:43.974
They adore him, they admire him

00:58:44.213 --> 00:58:51.086
and they try to imbibe his qualities within himself.

00:58:55.418 --> 00:59:07.529
Another blessing of Raja Lakshmi is
that She grants a particular type of a body,

00:59:07.606 --> 00:59:14.606
which has a coefficience, which gives vibrations.

00:59:18.652 --> 00:59:27.143
They may not be selfish people to make a big

00:59:27.244 --> 00:59:31.865
advertisement about themselves,
talking about themselves, this that.

00:59:32.425 --> 00:59:36.795
But the way they are wherever they are, they show.

00:59:42.467 --> 00:59:48.636
We had many like these in our times also.

00:59:50.238 --> 00:59:59.786
Maybe that people didn't accept them, maybe they are nowhere
now, some new Johnnies are looking to be more jumping.

01:00:02.363 --> 01:00:09.285
But whatever name is written in the heart of the
people, are people who are blessed by Raja Lakshmi.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:17.840
So what a politician has to understand
that he has not to make money,

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:26.834
he does not have to have a big show about himself,

01:00:29.467 --> 01:00:33.201
he does not have to do anything,

01:00:33.245 --> 01:00:39.700
that is like laundering the money from the country,

01:00:40.596 --> 01:00:43.977
he does not have to kill others who oppose him,

01:00:44.018 --> 01:00:49.145
he doesn't have to shout at those who trouble them. But
what has he to do?

01:00:50.289 --> 01:00:51.889
He has to remember that.

01:00:52.541 --> 01:00:57.708
"I'm here for the fame of a good man."

01:01:00.752 --> 01:01:06.780
He should worry about the fame he'll be leaving after his death.

01:01:08.495 --> 01:01:16.733
He should see to it that his fame is safe.
For example, see Shri Rama

01:01:17.033 --> 01:01:24.654
who was a King of benevolence, no doubt about it.

01:01:25.145 --> 01:01:33.543
But His own wife when somebody challenged
that She has lived with Ravana

01:01:33.786 --> 01:01:41.689
and how can She be pure. He knew that She was pure,
still He decided that He will ask Her to go

01:01:41.830 --> 01:01:53.033
because to keep the show, to keep the whole image
of a King and He sent Her away.

01:01:57.064 --> 01:02:04.951
But nowadays you find somebody's brother employed
in America, sister employed there

01:02:05.016 --> 01:02:14.573
and he has made his uncle has made a big house and his
wife has accumulated so much money. It is all going on.

01:02:17.319 --> 01:02:20.565
 Everybody will talk like that about that person,

01:02:21.933 --> 01:02:29.327
that he is just money oriented, he just spends money on
nonsensical thingsand he is just exploiting us. Everybody will talk

01:02:30.287 --> 01:02:38.716
but nobody will tell him on the face.
So what you have to worry is about

01:02:39.105 --> 01:02:46.105
absolute correct character. These days this is another
point.

01:02:47.075 --> 01:02:51.294
Every politician must have three, four keeps otherwise
he is not a politician.

01:02:51.723 --> 01:02:57.198
Likewe had Nawabs, we had one Nawab in Lucknow
who had hundred and sixty five wives.

01:02:58.698 --> 01:03:03.645
He thought if he doesn't have hundred and sixty five,
people won't accept him as a Nawab.

01:03:06.959 --> 01:03:13.499
So this is another inferiority complex
that you should have some women around you

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.077
so that people will say what a powerful man he is.

01:03:25.119 --> 01:03:30.581
Now those days are gone now, now Satya Yuga has started.

01:03:32.085 --> 01:03:45.460
In Satya Yuga I assure you anybody
who is not blessed by Raja Lakshmi will have to go to jail

01:03:46.531 --> 01:03:49.689
 or will have to leave the seat,

01:03:50.228 --> 01:03:57.228
will be thrown away or will be as they say,
"Doubly dying go to the waste, dust".

01:03:59.590 --> 01:04:06.590
It has to go, they'll be all exposed whatever tricks
they may try

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:17.413
and they will have the consequence
of being artificially the rulers.

01:04:20.151 --> 01:04:30.195
But the genuineness is the sign that the Queen of

01:04:30.350 --> 01:04:40.634
In Satya Yuga it'll happen blessings the goddess of
Raja Lakshmi is residing in that person.

01:04:46.208 --> 01:04:53.208
I'm sure. But even in Sahaja Yoga
I find people doing politics sometimes I'm amazed.

01:04:58.267 --> 01:05:08.862
People think politics means keeping groups, making
groups, telling things from here to there, there to there.

01:05:09.776 --> 01:05:14.009
That shows you lack collectivity.

01:05:16.541 --> 01:05:22.038
A person who is a Sahaja Yogi will try to cement everyone together

01:05:22.895 --> 01:05:27.018
 because the power lies in collectivity.

01:05:29.892 --> 01:05:40.118
To break the collectivity for anything is
very dangerous for that person as well as for others.

01:05:44.118 --> 01:05:47.911
So now you have entered into the kingdom of God,

01:05:49.667 --> 01:05:55.663
you are now sitting in the court of God Almighty.

01:05:58.645 --> 01:06:06.349
Here, of course, as courtiers you
have to dress up well, sit properly,

01:06:07.132 --> 01:06:10.960
take up your seats, you have to be systematic

01:06:11.555 --> 01:06:16.079
and above board because you are Sahaja Yogi's.

01:06:17.213 --> 01:06:18.994
You are not ordinary people.

01:06:20.264 --> 01:06:22.098
You are special people.

01:06:22.402 --> 01:06:26.237
How many people in this world are going to be Sahaja Yogi?

01:06:29.157 --> 01:06:40.819
You are special people, so try to make yourself
such beautiful instruments

01:06:41.053 --> 01:06:48.658
of Raja Lakshmi that people when they will
see you they will vote for you

01:06:49.175 --> 01:06:56.278
and tomorrow you will rule the world. [Applause]

01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:06.419
I do not want you to get out of politics or get in politics

01:07:07.164 --> 01:07:11.606
but you have to first get the blessings of Raja Lakshmi

01:07:12.250 --> 01:07:16.807
and then only you should understand what's wrong with our country,

01:07:17.268 --> 01:07:25.874
what we have to do, what is the purpose,
why do we want to become politicians,

01:07:26.491 --> 01:07:29.687
 what we have to do, we have to have plans,

01:07:30.612 --> 01:07:37.153
what is your project, all these things now
put your attention from yourself to outside.

01:07:37.921 --> 01:07:45.509
Like that day I received a letter saying,
my father is sick then my mother is sick then

01:07:45.847 --> 01:07:50.990
my son is sick," and this and that and that
and that. Such people can't do much.

01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:56.953
When the war of independence started in India

01:07:57.509 --> 01:08:01.691
we gave up our studies, gave up our parents,
gave up everything, we were very young people.

01:08:02.585 --> 01:08:08.369
So now you have to know that if you have to really take to politics

01:08:09.991 --> 01:08:16.597
you have to have the blessings of Raja Lakshmi
and for that you have to build up yourself

01:08:17.010 --> 01:08:19.874
with that dignity, with that sense.

01:08:22.437 --> 01:08:30.078
 I bless you from My heart that in
every country such people will come up.

01:08:31.072 --> 01:08:32.913
May God bless you.
