00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:09.387
Today we have assembled here to celebrate
the birth of Christ.

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:19.216
When you think of His birth one knows that
He was born in a very humble place

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.774
and all His life He lived in a very humble
way.

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:36.200
Also, as Sahaja yogis, you know that He was
the incarnation of Shri Ganesha

00:00:36.377 --> 00:00:43.373
which is, in essence, is innocence and He
was

00:00:46.472 --> 00:00:55.986
crucified due to the stupid understanding
of blind people.

00:00:58.677 --> 00:01:05.487
He was the eternal child and it’s so sad
that

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:17.412
when we talk about Christ and Christianity

00:01:17.613 --> 00:01:22.464
we feel that Christianity has gone just
the other way around,

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:26.643
on the other side of Christ.

00:01:26.844 --> 00:01:31.864
If one is construction, the another is
destruction

00:01:33.183 --> 00:01:37.945
and if one is innocence, another is cunning.

00:01:38.146 --> 00:01:44.829
If you see the Christian nations, it's very
surprising where we have got Christianity

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.996
in its practice; it's very surprising that
innocence has no place, no respect,

00:01:53.197 --> 00:02:02.004
chastity has no place, no respect, which
was the essence of Christ,

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:06.204
He was made of it.

00:02:09.825 --> 00:02:15.938
It is sometimes shocking how these so-called
Christian nations

00:02:16.138 --> 00:02:20.075
have maligned Christ to that extent

00:02:22.522 --> 00:02:27.448
and how they have ruined so many people
with their stupid ideas

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:34.712
of allowing people to indulge into all kinds
of filthy things.

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:40.941
And the second point is very important,
to see how

00:02:41.142 --> 00:02:46.112
He was born in a very humble abode,

00:02:46.313 --> 00:02:50.305
He lived in a very humble way.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.568
He was a son of a carpenter so He lived
like a carpenter,

00:03:00.261 --> 00:03:07.230
but in the Western life people are so
materialistic

00:03:07.431 --> 00:03:13.514
and to them to live lavishly, to show off
their wealth

00:03:13.715 --> 00:03:18.915
and to plunder people, plunder countries
after countries

00:03:19.116 --> 00:03:23.767
for material gain is a common thing.

00:03:23.968 --> 00:03:32.218
They do not feel also that it is wrong and
they are quite proud of it.

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:38.072
And the third great thing about Christ was
that

00:03:38.273 --> 00:03:44.866
He wanted people to love each other and
to be humble,

00:03:45.067 --> 00:03:53.349
but the arrogance and the cruelty that one
has seen of the Christian nations

00:03:53.550 --> 00:04:00.770
one cannot understand how are they anywhere
near Christ.

00:04:01.788 --> 00:04:07.571
He has said about, "Blessed are those who
are meek".

00:04:07.772 --> 00:04:13.490
Where are those meek people living? Not
in the western countries,

00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:18.891
not in the countries where Christ is
worshipped, where temples are raised,

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:27.185
are raised in His honor and have been
worshipping the Mother for so many years.

00:04:27.386 --> 00:04:32.789
What a sinful thing it is to do to Christ.

00:04:33.235 --> 00:04:39.591
Is the greatest sin that we say that we are
following Christ

00:04:39.792 --> 00:04:43.050
and to do all these horrible things,

00:04:43.232 --> 00:04:49.146
all such people have to go to hell
of the worst type, no doubt about it.

00:04:49.347 --> 00:04:52.924
They may not realize but they are already
getting into it,

00:04:53.093 --> 00:04:56.439
they are already having this problem.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:02.183
They are worse than people who crucified
Christ, this is every-day crucifixion.

00:05:02.384 --> 00:05:07.862
So it's a great occasion today to celebrate

00:05:08.063 --> 00:05:14.108
the birth of Christ, who came on this earth
to help us in our resurrection,

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:18.142
to talk about the Holy Ghost.

00:05:18.842 --> 00:05:24.489
He was bearing all the brunt of the people,
everything,

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.540
but the outcome of that life is so
horrifying that sometimes I get worried

00:05:29.741 --> 00:05:34.347
that I hope they don't make something out
of Me like that.

00:05:34.548 --> 00:05:39.825
It is such a stupid ideas people have
in the west,

00:05:40.026 --> 00:05:45.574
that for any sensible man he can see the way

00:05:45.775 --> 00:05:53.468
they are emotional, romantic, nonsensical.
They have no respect

00:05:54.144 --> 00:05:58.711
for themselves and to follow Christ with
that kind of an attitude is, I think is,

00:05:58.912 --> 00:06:04.908
they have no business, they have no right,
but it has happened.

00:06:05.109 --> 00:06:11.771
Now you people are born again as Christ
has said, "You are to be born again".

00:06:11.972 --> 00:06:17.767
You have achieved that state which Christ
was talking about.

00:06:17.968 --> 00:06:24.621
You are the special type of people. I never
had such hopes I must say.

00:06:24.822 --> 00:06:30.835
The first encounter was so horrible that I
didn't think that many will come out of it

00:06:31.036 --> 00:06:34.443
but so many of you have come out of it

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:41.238
and have really glorified the name of
Christ, no doubt about it, and keep it up.

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:44.353
I would request you now to know that you
are Sahaja yogis

00:06:44.554 --> 00:06:47.763
and that you are the followers of Christ.

00:06:47.964 --> 00:06:52.955
You are the Gnostics as described, you are
the ones who know

00:06:53.156 --> 00:06:58.810
and that's how you have to help people
to emancipate.

00:06:59.011 --> 00:07:07.251
It is very surprising that I saw that
the Western life,

00:07:07.452 --> 00:07:16.296
the stupid, destructive ideas, did not kill
the innocence.

00:07:16.497 --> 00:07:25.077
Like the clouds, all these affectations
were there

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:30.230
but once the Kundalini rose the innocence
started expressing itself.

00:07:30.431 --> 00:07:39.318
But still, I would say that this kind
of lovey-dovey stuff

00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:45.730
must be given up. It is just most
un-Christian

00:07:45.931 --> 00:07:51.556
because if you see His life, it was a life
of a tapasvi,

00:07:51.757 --> 00:07:59.299
a man who lived in a very detached manner,
in nisanga.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.851
So for Sahaja yogis who are coming from
Christian life

00:08:04.052 --> 00:08:08.478
have to understand if they have to get rid
of it, they should be like that.

00:08:08.679 --> 00:08:13.226
But on the contrary, see the interest
in marriages,

00:08:13.427 --> 00:08:20.545
the interest in all this kind of thing and
after marriage - is a bit too much.

00:08:22.817 --> 00:08:27.846
It is so much in it, I mean it’s absurd,
it's absurd in Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:28.047 --> 00:08:35.536
It's one of the lifestyles, is alright, one
of the part, it's not everything;

00:08:35.737 --> 00:08:41.329
and it covers the whole entire personality
of a Christian personality.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:47.564
Not with Muslims or Hindus, I've seen that.
I mean, I'm married too.

00:08:47.765 --> 00:08:54.565
But it doesn't cover My whole entire being
with it. How can it?

00:08:54.766 --> 00:08:59.429
And that's the problem is - that once
marriage system starts, anything starts,

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:04.727
“oh it becomes so important” and I'm faced
with problems all the time.

00:09:04.928 --> 00:09:07.949
The marriage is performed then letters will
be coming,

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.891
“this has happened to my marriage”.
They must get married,

00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:13.958
nobody is such that, supposing now one is
finished,

00:09:14.167 --> 00:09:19.623
live without marriage, they cannot do it,
just can't live.

00:09:19.824 --> 00:09:23.070
Christ never got married.

00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:28.542
They cannot have that tapasvita in them
and they depend so much,

00:09:28.743 --> 00:09:32.206
they'll ruin their wives, they'll ruin
their husbands, they'll ruin Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:32.407 --> 00:09:35.142
They'll take them away - but it's something
surprising -

00:09:35.343 --> 00:09:42.282
the importance of Sahaja Yoga is so
minimized by this Christian mind,

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:48.350
[that?] I don't know from where these ideas
have come to you.

00:09:50.376 --> 00:09:57.441
It's a juxtaposition as you can call it,
juxtaposition.

00:09:57.642 --> 00:10:03.087
There is no similarity between the life
Christ must have thought

00:10:03.288 --> 00:10:06.155
people would lead and the people are
leading.

00:10:06.379 --> 00:10:12.502
So it is necessary for Sahaja yogis to have
a dignity and a sense

00:10:12.703 --> 00:10:15.451
and to know that they are grounded
in Sahaja Yoga

00:10:15.652 --> 00:10:23.529
and marriage and all those things are just
subsidiary. It's not the end of life.

00:10:24.536 --> 00:10:30.351
And when I see that happening I am rather
surprised in Sahaja Yoga

00:10:30.552 --> 00:10:36.546
I have to marry people because I believe
that one should lead a proper married life.

00:10:36.747 --> 00:10:41.665
Because if you just take up a sanyasa
without going through this married life,

00:10:41.866 --> 00:10:46.046
you can be very much hypocritical.

00:10:46.247 --> 00:10:50.657
But that doesn't mean that marriage is
everything.

00:10:50.858 --> 00:10:57.624
It's not so important, it's just something
has to happen.

00:10:57.825 --> 00:11:02.151
It's not even important than any puja;

00:11:02.352 --> 00:11:07.897
it's not even important than praying to Me;

00:11:08.098 --> 00:11:12.062
it's not even important than meditating;

00:11:12.263 --> 00:11:19.113
it's not important at all than even eating
your food.

00:11:20.759 --> 00:11:25.072
The more I know you start making of it
you fall into the same trap

00:11:25.273 --> 00:11:28.440
from where I pulled you out.

00:11:29.297 --> 00:11:36.997
So as I, the other day I was telling people
about what they have to do

00:11:37.198 --> 00:11:45.236
about these caste system we have in India.
So in the society of Sahaja yogis,

00:11:45.437 --> 00:11:50.995
it should be only a one day affair or two
day affair at the most.

00:11:51.608 --> 00:11:57.064
But so much importance, husband, wives,
getting married,

00:11:57.257 --> 00:12:02.643
then solving their problems, I get
a headache with them.

00:12:02.844 --> 00:12:05.824
And they'll always come "my wife, you know,
she's like this,

00:12:06.025 --> 00:12:09.822
and wife's sister like that, and wife's
this".

00:12:10.023 --> 00:12:14.008
I mean, one should be ashamed even to say
that "my wife".

00:12:14.209 --> 00:12:19.973
In India nobody says like that. I don't
think anybody will say "my wife".

00:12:20.174 --> 00:12:25.996
It's not done. At the most they'll say
"my children's mother",

00:12:26.197 --> 00:12:31.701
and if you have no children you don't say
anything.

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:41.433
So this is the doom from which you have
come out. Please try to understand.

00:12:42.379 --> 00:12:47.736
From hell we have come out, absolutely
wrong ideas we had,

00:12:47.905 --> 00:12:56.377
from there we have come out, now be
dignified, be sensible.

00:12:57.268 --> 00:13:01.973
An over-importance to such un-important
thing

00:13:02.174 --> 00:13:06.099
will not allow you to rise very high
in life.

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.446
But I don't say you don't marry, you must
marry.

00:13:08.647 --> 00:13:14.580
Of course, if you have a Sahaja yogini who
is also a good Sahaja yogini and she knows

00:13:14.781 --> 00:13:19.968
about Sahaja Yoga and then of course you
are helped much more, definitely.

00:13:20.136 --> 00:13:27.556
You get much more power, much more
understanding, much more joy

00:13:27.757 --> 00:13:33.453
and it's very good but the entire
relationship is so important

00:13:33.654 --> 00:13:39.726
on small, small things, this is just beyond
Me to understand.

00:13:39.927 --> 00:13:44.954
Then I see that then the girls fall in love
with the man whom they marry, finished;

00:13:45.155 --> 00:13:48.655
the man is finished, the woman is finished.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:56.443
Today I am taking this great occasion
to tell you

00:13:56.644 --> 00:14:02.533
that Christ was born to Immaculata;

00:14:06.812 --> 00:14:12.244
and that's how I have given you your second
birth

00:14:13.968 --> 00:14:17.453
and you are so pure.

00:14:18.032 --> 00:14:23.010
So all the impurities, you must see them
clearly.

00:14:23.211 --> 00:14:30.188
I know you don't like them but they still
creep from here and there.

00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:35.341
Of course if the society you see in the west
is a society which

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:38.727
of course there is no family, no wife,
nothing of the kind,

00:14:38.928 --> 00:14:43.571
so it's just slightly better than that -
but again you get stuck.

00:14:43.772 --> 00:14:48.487
If you have to come up to this stage, you
have to give up the staircase.

00:14:48.683 --> 00:14:52.454
You think that you have achieved a lot
because now you have a settled family

00:14:52.655 --> 00:14:57.387
and settled children and you are only worried
about your own children all the time.

00:14:57.588 --> 00:15:06.388
No, it's another temptation; it's [a] very
big temptation.

00:15:08.531 --> 00:15:16.901
So on the great occasion of the birth
of Christ we have to say to ourselves

00:15:17.102 --> 00:15:23.550
that we are dedicated to Sahaja Yoga,

00:15:25.457 --> 00:15:31.120
that's the main thing, everything is
subsidiary.

00:15:32.615 --> 00:15:38.423
I hope you'll understand that we are now

00:15:38.624 --> 00:15:42.625
on the cusp of a wave from where we are
going to jump onto another wave,

00:15:42.826 --> 00:15:48.204
which will be much higher than this, but
you must have the worthiness.

00:15:48.405 --> 00:15:53.193
If you are not sea-worthy you’ll be
drowned,

00:15:55.219 --> 00:15:59.681
so we have to develop that worthiness -
and we have Christ before us.

00:15:59.882 --> 00:16:04.010
What a life, what a life it was.

00:16:04.211 --> 00:16:09.379
He lived like a human being in a humble
way and what a life.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:18.608
And how truthfully forthright He was to say
everything so clearly.

00:16:18.809 --> 00:16:21.482
In the same way you'll have your strength

00:16:21.683 --> 00:16:25.551
when you will know that you are much more
than a married man

00:16:25.752 --> 00:16:30.881
and you are much more than your nationality.

00:16:31.082 --> 00:16:34.488
You are a higher personality,

00:16:34.689 --> 00:16:41.049
a Sahaja yogi who is dwelling in the bliss
of the Kingdom of God.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:48.255
That's the bliss, not the family bliss and
the children bliss, but the bliss of God.

00:16:48.456 --> 00:16:51.553
May God bless you.
