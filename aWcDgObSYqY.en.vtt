WEBVTT

02:18.310 --> 02:25.310
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

02:26.580 --> 02:33.580
At the very outset we have to understand that
truth is what it is. We cannot conceptualize

02:39.420 --> 02:46.420
it. We cannot organize it. And we cannot use
it for our own purposes. Moreover, with the

02:52.010 --> 02:59.010
blinkers on both the sides like a horse, with
all our conditionings, we cannot find the

03:01.380 --> 03:08.380
truth. We have to be free people. We have
to be open-minded people, like scientists,

03:09.730 --> 03:16.730
to see for ourselves what is the truth. If
somebody preaches something, professes something,

03:20.590 --> 03:27.590
says something, is not to be accepted blindfolded.
As I told you yesterday, that the essence

03:31.840 --> 03:38.840
of all the religions is to find the eternal
and to treat the transitory in its own understanding

03:42.459 --> 03:49.459
and in its own limitations. That’s why we
have lost our balance. If we are really the

03:50.150 --> 03:57.150
people who want to know the truth, we have
to know that at human awareness we cannot

04:03.889 --> 04:10.609
know it. It becomes a concept.

04:10.609 --> 04:17.609
You have to have the spiritual awareness,
but spiritual awareness is a state of your

04:19.190 --> 04:26.190
being, where you become the spirit. Again
the word I’ll say – “become.” It’s

04:27.240 --> 04:33.930
not artificially certifying somebody that
now you have become a Hindu or a Christian

04:33.930 --> 04:40.930
or a Muslim, you become anything. Because
you may be a Muslim, Christian, Hindu, anything,

04:41.200 --> 04:48.200
you can commit any sin. You can do anything
that is wrong. Nothing from inside is going

04:49.760 --> 04:56.760
to stop you. So all these things have become
so much outward that now there are people

04:59.690 --> 05:06.690
who have started saying there is no God, there
is nothing like religion, which is not true.

05:08.460 --> 05:15.460
First of all when we say there is nothing,
or there is not God, we should find out, have

05:16.650 --> 05:23.650
we been able to find out about it or just
in our ego we are saying there is no God?

05:25.890 --> 05:32.890
Have we been able to work it out to see if
there is God or not? You do not judge God

05:33.440 --> 05:40.370
by the people who talk about God. Anybody
can talk about God because they think there’s

05:40.370 --> 05:46.500
no law that can catch them. They can talk
against Him, they can talk for Him, they can

05:46.500 --> 05:51.690
do the way they like. They can even make money
by talking against God and against all the

05:51.690 --> 05:58.690
prophets – that’s a very good way of making
money, blackmail. But does that mean that

05:59.550 --> 06:06.550
whatever is written is a bible, or whatever
is black and white, is to be taken that seriously?

06:11.110 --> 06:18.110
So first of all, we have to be little independent
to be free, to know that if you have to know

06:20.400 --> 06:27.400
the spirit - as they said “know thyself”
- then you have to know it on your central

06:28.500 --> 06:35.500
nervous system. As I can feel this is cold
or hot, you have to feel the divine power

06:43.090 --> 06:50.090
which is all-pervading, which is the truth,
which manifests the truth, because it is the

06:52.300 --> 06:59.300
love of God. You have to first feel it on
your central nervous system, which is the

07:04.090 --> 07:06.330
bodha.

07:06.330 --> 07:13.330
Now one may say that in the West we have advanced
so much, all right. We have gone too far with

07:17.470 --> 07:24.470
everything. But if we see, when we started
with science, what have we produced? Hydrogen

07:27.060 --> 07:34.060
bomb, atom bomb, all kinds of devils sitting
on our heads. You take to any enterprise that

07:36.400 --> 07:43.400
we did, we go to extremes. There is no balance.
Any mental projection is linear, it moves

07:46.319 --> 07:52.900
in one line and then recoils back, and then
you are shocked. Now you have got acid rain.

07:52.900 --> 07:59.900
You produced machinery, all right. Machinery
is for you, you are not for machinery. And

08:02.479 --> 08:09.479
thus, there is no balance between you and
the machinery, no balance between you and

08:10.360 --> 08:17.360
the science. It is just like going amok with
anything that you get into your hand. And

08:18.449 --> 08:25.449
this balance you can only have when you become
the spirit. You see beautiful chandeliers

08:27.910 --> 08:34.910
here, beautifully made, but unless and until
there is light what is the meaning of these

08:35.940 --> 08:42.940
chandeliers? Nothing. In the same way, if
you do not have the light of the spirit shining

08:45.260 --> 08:51.319
in your attention, you will not know your
meaning. Like this instrument – unless and

08:51.319 --> 08:57.020
until it is connected to the mains, it is
useless. Unless and until we are connected

08:57.020 --> 09:04.020
to the mains, we do not know the absolute,
and that’s why all these problems are there.

09:05.310 --> 09:12.310
Now when I am talking about this instrument,
which lies within us, one has to again know

09:18.880 --> 09:25.880
that this is the knowledge of the roots. And
to know the knowledge of the roots, you have

09:26.870 --> 09:33.870
to become a subtler personality. With a gross
mind, you cannot see it. To become the subtler

09:35.420 --> 09:41.870
personality, minimum of minimum, you have
to know that so far you have not known the

09:41.870 --> 09:48.870
roots. If you had known, there would be no
problem. But there’s something has gone

09:50.040 --> 09:57.040
wrong somewhere in every human enterprise,
even in religions, that’s why today we find

10:00.829 --> 10:07.829
this kind of a farce going on. And what is
gone wrong is that we have to seek the eternal.

10:16.550 --> 10:23.550
Maybe it might look a little different, for
example Buddha and Mahavira did not talk about

10:24.510 --> 10:31.510
God at all. I also did not talk about God
for four years, at least three years. As soon

10:36.060 --> 10:42.610
as you talk of God, again people start jumping,
“When can we become God?” – this is

10:42.610 --> 10:46.300
the first question.

10:46.300 --> 10:53.130
So first you become the self –the first
step. That’s why they did not talk. They

10:53.130 --> 11:00.130
said first you become yourself. Unless and
until you have your eyes, how can you see

11:00.779 --> 11:07.779
the colors? So first have your eyes. It is
for your benevolence that you better get what

11:15.070 --> 11:22.070
you deserve, what is your own. It’s your
birthright as a human being to become the

11:23.820 --> 11:30.390
spirit. That is what Sahaja Yoga is – Saha
means “with” and ja is “born.” Born

11:30.390 --> 11:37.390
with you is the right to get this yoga, is
the union with the Divine. It’s your birthright

11:43.370 --> 11:50.370
as a human being. You are as I told you at
the epitome of evolution. And it has to work

11:52.810 --> 11:59.810
out, but please open your hearts and open
your minds. Just open it and see for yourself,

12:01.380 --> 12:07.510
it will work, I know. Yesterday it has worked.
It is going to work out today also. But by

12:07.510 --> 12:14.510
thinking about it, you cannot conceptualize.
This is the biggest problem of our seeking

12:16.950 --> 12:23.950
that we run after some sort of a concept.

12:24.260 --> 12:31.260
Now here you have seen this instrument is
the most beautiful instrument that is created

12:31.420 --> 12:38.420
within us during the process of our evolution.
The first one is the most beautiful one because

12:40.440 --> 12:47.440
it stands for our innocence. This innocence
is the one which gives us real support, real

12:51.760 --> 12:58.760
strength. And you’ll be surprised it is
never destroyed. It may be overshadowed, there

13:02.570 --> 13:09.570
may be clouds. Maybe it may look to be a very
dark sky. Maybe a hopeless case. Some people

13:11.690 --> 13:18.690
might say that we have destroyed our innocence.
It cannot be destroyed. Whatever you might

13:20.740 --> 13:27.740
have done, this is one center which cannot
be destroyed. You may have problems with it

13:28.480 --> 13:34.870
but it cannot be destroyed. It is such a wonderful
center you have got, which has got four petals,

13:34.870 --> 13:41.870
which looks after the pelvic plexus, looks
after all the excretion within us.

13:44.050 --> 13:51.050
In our own freedom, so-called, we do all kinds
of things which may not be benevolent for

13:54.000 --> 14:01.000
ourselves, doesn’t matter. Kundalini cannot
be destroyed - the source which is going to

14:08.010 --> 14:15.010
give you the self-realization, I say She is
your individual Mother. And this Mother is

14:18.699 --> 14:25.279
such a loving Mother and She knows each and
everything about you - from your past, from

14:25.279 --> 14:32.279
your past lives - She knows you very well.
She is just waiting for a chance that She

14:33.810 --> 14:40.810
can be awakened and She can give you your
second birth. When you were born, your mother

14:41.990 --> 14:44.410
suffered for you – you did not suffer.

14:44.410 --> 14:49.970
So to say that Kundalini awakening gives this
kind of a nonsense and that kind of a nonsense

14:49.970 --> 14:56.970
is all falsehood. Absolutely falsehood. And
it is so absurd that how can a mother give

15:00.529 --> 15:07.529
you problems? I mean, I don’t know about
some mothers are funny also – that’s all

15:07.649 --> 15:14.649
human problems. But this is a Divine Mother.
She’s not going to give you trouble. But

15:16.649 --> 15:23.649
these problems that have come are coming from
people who have no authority, who have no

15:24.230 --> 15:29.070
education, who do not know what Kundalini
is. Some say it is in the stomach, some say

15:29.070 --> 15:36.070
in the head, some say in the legs. Those who
have no character of their own, because they

15:36.430 --> 15:43.430
have to be pure people themselves, try all
kinds of nonsensical tricks and create problems

15:44.970 --> 15:51.970
on the sympathetic nervous system and they
call it as something that it is the problem

15:52.149 --> 15:59.149
of the Kundalini. Kundalini will never give
you any problems. On the contrary, when She

16:00.019 --> 16:06.709
rises and when you get your awakening, the
first thing that is established is thoughtless

16:06.709 --> 16:07.410
awareness.

16:07.410 --> 16:14.410
For when a thought rises, falls, another thought
rises, falls, and the Kundalini makes the

16:18.949 --> 16:25.949
thoughts smaller and in between at the present.
It makes you stop in the present and you grow

16:28.560 --> 16:34.740
in the present, and the thoughts, if you want
to think you can think, if you don’t want

16:34.740 --> 16:39.670
to think, it is not like a madhouse going
on all the time, you don’t know how to stop

16:39.670 --> 16:46.670
it. This works out with the Kundalini’s
awakening when She crosses this center of

16:50.100 --> 16:54.259
ours, which we call as Agnya chakra.

16:54.259 --> 17:00.220
Now we should not have, again I say, blinkers
about Christ. Let us see what people have

17:00.220 --> 17:07.220
to say about Christ in other shastras and
scriptures. Who was He? Because people did

17:10.510 --> 17:17.510
not allow Him to manifest for more than four
years and in four years what can you do? You

17:17.550 --> 17:24.550
cannot do anything. I must tell you in London
I came, My husband was selected for a job

17:25.459 --> 17:31.919
and that’s how we are here, and for four
years I was struggling with seven of them,

17:31.919 --> 17:37.840
just struggling. Giving realization was such
a difficult subject to the English people

17:37.840 --> 17:44.840
at that time. They are hard nuts, I know.
But once they break, they are the best. I

17:46.830 --> 17:53.790
think the best are the hardest. And it worked,
it clicked.

17:53.790 --> 18:00.790
I am surprised that I had to work very hard
but they are such a foundation of Sahaja Yoga.

18:02.639 --> 18:07.980
Immediately they went all out and very scholarly
also – a lot of scholarship in them. Found

18:07.980 --> 18:14.860
out all about Kundalini, everything from wherever
– your libraries are so well-equipped. And

18:14.860 --> 18:21.860
I was surprised, it was all there. They studied
Sanskrit. Now can you imagine these people

18:23.240 --> 18:30.240
English singing Sanskrit song with that speed?
They could not even say one sentence in Hindi

18:31.070 --> 18:35.659
when they were in India. Three hundred years
they were there, they could not speak one

18:35.659 --> 18:42.659
sentence you will be surprised. We had to
tell them in English how to speak Hindi. Like

18:43.750 --> 18:49.880
you have to say “open the door” – is
in Hindi, is darwaja khol do. They couldn’t

18:49.880 --> 18:55.480
say it. So we had to say, “there was a banker”
or something like that – means “close

18:55.480 --> 19:01.880
the door” – “there was a banker.”
They couldn’t speak Hindi. Sanskrit is very

19:01.880 --> 19:07.810
far off. And now look at them, what has happened
to them. And Indian music is such a difficult

19:07.810 --> 19:13.899
music, you have to really, it is a question
of penance, tremendous penance. Now we have

19:13.899 --> 19:20.230
people who play beautiful tabla, beautiful
instruments not only but sing so well. Swiss,

19:20.230 --> 19:27.230
the hardest nuts you can ever think of, they
are - you’ll be amazed the Swiss the way

19:29.429 --> 19:36.429
they sing, tremendous manifestation in such
a short time. Of course they can also sing

19:39.690 --> 19:45.179
English very well, they know English music
very well, or should say Western music very

19:45.179 --> 19:52.179
well. But to learn this difficult melodies
of India is remarkable. I am myself surprised

19:52.980 --> 19:53.940
at this.

19:53.940 --> 20:00.940
So what happens in the second center when
it enters, you just become dynamic, because

20:01.950 --> 20:08.950
the second center is for aesthetics and for
creativity. Now we have, like My brother who

20:10.020 --> 20:17.020
was a chartered accountant, he was very bad
at all the languages. Very bad, of course

20:17.599 --> 20:24.520
Sanskrit was out of question. Now he is making
poetry in Sanskrit and in Urdu language and

20:24.520 --> 20:30.510
also in Marathi, which is the most difficult
language. This is the second center. When

20:30.510 --> 20:37.510
Kundalini nourishes that center, like a very
beautiful Mother she nourishes. You must have

20:37.909 --> 20:44.909
heard about some great artists – Amjad Ali,
he was here – after realization he became

20:46.040 --> 20:52.159
such a great artist. There are so many artists.
In India, they understand. They want to sing

20:52.159 --> 20:58.190
before Me. I mean I don’t know how to say
that now only one person can sing. Because

20:58.190 --> 21:05.190
their Kundalini goes up, and the creativity
becomes so tremendously active and so dynamic.

21:05.550 --> 21:12.550
At the same time, that person becomes very
mild, very sweet, very compassionate. Like

21:15.099 --> 21:21.340
there’s one great singer. She’s a Muslim
lady, I will not name her.

21:21.340 --> 21:24.990
She wanted to sing and she sent Me word, “Please
allow me to sing in Your birthday.”

21:24.990 --> 21:27.109
And I said, “All right, give her a chance.”

21:27.109 --> 21:34.109
So she came down. And the lady who was playing
harmonium – she came and told Me, “This

21:34.639 --> 21:41.580
lady is just an atom bomb, You don’t know
how she gets angry if there’s one note I

21:41.580 --> 21:43.500
play wrong.”

21:43.500 --> 21:49.359
I saw her but she was very silently playing
– nothing doing, she never got angry with

21:49.359 --> 21:54.149
anyone. So in the interval, this lady comes
and tells Me, “That see in Your presence,

21:54.149 --> 22:01.149
I don’t know what has happened to this lady.
This tiger has become like a cow. How is it?”

22:02.859 --> 22:06.270
I said, “See her Kundalini has come up.”

22:06.270 --> 22:13.270
So this violence, this anger, this temper
is not your creation, it’s the creation

22:15.609 --> 22:22.609
of your liver. Your liver is little out of
order because of many things, and the temper

22:25.090 --> 22:32.090
is there. Now when the temper is too much,
you don’t know what to do. I mean you can

22:32.349 --> 22:38.710
do whatever you like. In your temper after
all, it’s like a drunken personality. You

22:38.710 --> 22:45.710
have to approach a person in a temper with
a barge pole. But all this temper, everything,

22:46.280 --> 22:53.280
becomes so cool and so beautiful. It’s very
surprising. A very dynamic person becomes

22:54.419 --> 23:01.419
extremely compassionate, extremely compassionate,
and I’ve had such beautiful experiences

23:02.200 --> 23:09.200
of their compassion that it’s not easy to
describe.

23:09.750 --> 23:16.750
Now also they say that there are certain nationalities
which has got a trait like this and a trait

23:17.290 --> 23:24.290
like that, everything dissolves. Everything
dissolves because of this center which is

23:26.190 --> 23:33.190
so creative and which also gives you the manifestation
of pure knowledge - pure knowledge. For example

23:37.929 --> 23:44.929
you start feeling on your finger tips – you
just start feeling on your finger tips. Like

23:45.889 --> 23:52.889
today only, somebody came and told Me, “That
Mataji my Agnya is catching.” Agnya is this

23:53.550 --> 24:00.550
center - means “I’ve got my ego on.”
Will anybody say like that? On the contrary

24:01.040 --> 24:04.760
if you tell somebody, “You have got your
ego,” they’ll show you that they have

24:04.760 --> 24:10.970
their ego on. It’s very dangerous to say
to somebody that your ego is on. But just

24:10.970 --> 24:16.849
because of self knowledge - pure knowledge
- you know that this Mr. Ego is sitting here

24:16.849 --> 24:23.849
and I cannot cross through and there’s a
blockage here, which I have to take it out.

24:28.250 --> 24:32.510
It’s so innate within you, everything, only
thing is your connection has to be made.

24:32.510 --> 24:39.510
Once the connection is made, immediately you
know about yourself. And this center which

24:40.320 --> 24:47.320
is responsible for creating all kinds of funny
thoughts and horrible creativity becomes so

24:49.340 --> 24:54.580
benevolent, so soothing, so beautiful.

24:54.580 --> 25:01.580
Apart from that, as I told you just now, these
people who could not even say one word in

25:02.720 --> 25:09.609
Hindi language have started singing Sanskrit
and this - specially the one they sang, the

25:09.609 --> 25:16.609
first one - many Indians cannot sing that
way I can tell you, they can’t. It’s not

25:17.750 --> 25:24.750
easy. It’s a very great tongue twister first
of all the language is. Apart from that, to

25:24.899 --> 25:31.899
sing in such a correct pronunciation is so
difficult but they have done it. So in Sahaja

25:36.129 --> 25:42.879
Yoga, an artist who is struggling today may
become a great artist tomorrow. But still

25:42.879 --> 25:48.950
I would say these are temptations. You’ll
become a great artist, you’ll start earning

25:48.950 --> 25:55.040
more money, this, that…but that’s not
the one. You have to really be satisfied with,

25:55.040 --> 25:58.460
you will never be satisfied with that.

25:58.460 --> 26:05.460
So you move to the third center which we call
as the Nabhi chakra. This center is, on one

26:10.369 --> 26:17.369
side, is made of water and another side with
fire. Around it are our ten valencies, which

26:20.320 --> 26:27.320
we can call as our innate religion within
ourselves. Now this Nabhi itself - or we can

26:30.679 --> 26:37.679
call the solar plexus or we can say the Navel
chakra - gives us, as soon as the Kundalini

26:43.669 --> 26:50.619
rises, she awakens this and the light when
it spreads, you become religious. I don’t

26:50.619 --> 26:57.490
have to tell you anything, you just become.
I don’t have to say that you don’t take

26:57.490 --> 27:03.040
drugs. You just don’t take it. Overnight
I have seen people have given up drugs. Overnight,

27:03.040 --> 27:08.580
alcoholism. Overnight, everything. And they
enjoy their virtues. That’s the best part

27:08.580 --> 27:15.580
of it. Some people think, well then what is
the fun? What is this that you take something

27:16.919 --> 27:23.919
in the pub and next day you have hangover.
Here you take something and next day you are

27:24.500 --> 27:31.500
much better off. It never comes down. It never
gives you a reaction. It’s not artificial.

27:32.250 --> 27:39.250
It’s not intoxicating. It is from your nerves
it’s bubbling out.

27:39.820 --> 27:46.619
So this is the center which is very important
in us because most of us have a problem with

27:46.619 --> 27:53.619
this center. And here we have a capacity by
this center that we enjoy our generosity.

28:08.780 --> 28:15.629
Now all matter whatever it is - we are materialistic,
materialistic, it is a good idea to be materialistic.

28:15.629 --> 28:22.629
But the matter is, the aesthetics of matters
are, that you can give it to others suggesting

28:24.200 --> 28:31.200
your love in it. I think that’s the only
thing the matter can do. And in a very special

28:32.980 --> 28:39.980
way you can express that love. For example,
somebody likes a particular thing - you go

28:41.369 --> 28:48.369
all the way to get it and give that small
thing, very small thing, to the person and

28:52.220 --> 28:59.220
the joy, not out of the money that you have
spent, but the feelings you have expressed

29:00.480 --> 29:07.480
of knowing what that person would love. And
this kind of a depth develops within you.

29:14.379 --> 29:21.379
Such lovable beautiful society you enter into.
And you don’t need anything because everybody

29:25.589 --> 29:32.589
is looking after your needs. Now I have told
them I love flowers because I don’t take

29:32.690 --> 29:37.119
anything else. So you must see whenever I
come My house is so filled with flowers that

29:37.119 --> 29:41.490
My husband was saying, “Let us go live in
the garden and let the flowers be here.”

29:41.490 --> 29:48.490
So you see the joy of giving, comes from this
center. And whatever you eat, whatever you

29:57.530 --> 30:04.530
have to eat, whatever is good for you, you
eat. You don’t have to bother as to what

30:04.800 --> 30:10.580
to eat, what not to eat – you just eat whatever
is good for you, benevolent for you. You become

30:10.580 --> 30:17.580
so wise and also you please others. You don’t
displease others by saying, “This is bad

30:18.740 --> 30:25.000
food, I want that.” ’I want’ goes away.
What do you want?

30:25.000 --> 30:27.720
[speaks aside]

30:27.720 --> 30:34.720
So the, like you could say a candle which
is not enlightened, is waiting to be enlightened,

30:37.659 --> 30:44.659
is asking for the light – “I want light.”
But once it is enlightened, it gives light

30:44.780 --> 30:51.780
to others, automatically - supposed to be.
In the same way you also start giving your

30:52.800 --> 30:59.800
light, your love, your joy to others, automatically.
I don’t have to tell you. Nobody has to

31:02.330 --> 31:08.429
go through any Ten Commandments anymore. Those
days are gone. Now automatically you become

31:08.429 --> 31:15.429
like that - very beautiful people, very affectionate
and glorious, I should say. If you see the

31:24.270 --> 31:31.270
glow on the face of Sahaja Yogis, the face
itself is radiant. Many people drop out their

31:33.409 --> 31:40.409
ten years to twenty years in their age and
they are so enthusiastic, never get tired,

31:42.200 --> 31:48.879
especially in England I’ve seen – or also
in the West I would say everywhere – people

31:48.879 --> 31:50.690
get very really tired.

31:50.690 --> 31:55.940
On the television also you find people will
come and sit down “huh…” Young people,

31:55.940 --> 32:02.940
they’ll talk ten times, they’ll say “huh…
Why are we so tired?” Because we think too

32:08.139 --> 32:15.139
much. All energy is wasted in thinking, so
no energy left to enjoy anything whatsoever.

32:15.300 --> 32:22.300
For example, you have to have people for dinner,
they think what to bring, how to make it formal,

32:22.770 --> 32:28.310
what to do, this thing, that thing, so agitated
and so nervous about the whole thing – when

32:28.310 --> 32:35.099
the guests come in, they feel like running
away. Because so much of tension of thinking,

32:35.099 --> 32:41.240
thinking, thinking….. Planning, planning,
planning, planning, planning… Ultimately

32:41.240 --> 32:44.599
the whole joy has disappeared.

32:44.599 --> 32:51.599
So the second center which is there, it does
a very miraculous thing, is to provide the

32:55.480 --> 33:02.129
grey cells in our brain, when we are using
it for thinking, and also it looks after your

33:02.129 --> 33:09.129
liver, your pancreas, your spleen, your kidneys
and lower part of your abdomen. Instead of

33:13.580 --> 33:19.899
doing that, poor thing is busy only sending
grey cells to your brain because thinking,

33:19.899 --> 33:26.899
thinking, thinking, thinking, like mad. So
you develop all other diseases – liver trouble,

33:27.200 --> 33:34.200
which is very common. Then you develop diabetes
– very common. Yesterday at least there

33:37.320 --> 33:44.169
were ten people who said we have diabetes.
Now diabetes you do not develop by taking

33:44.169 --> 33:50.329
too much sugar – take it from Me. In India
if you go to a village, you’ll see that

33:50.329 --> 33:56.300
he takes sugar in such a manner that in the
cup the spoon must stand at right angles,

33:56.300 --> 34:03.300
otherwise he won’t take it. But he never
gets diabetes. The reason is he doesn’t

34:03.690 --> 34:10.669
think of tomorrow - he just works hard, eats
his food and sleeps off, nicely. He doesn’t

34:10.669 --> 34:17.669
take sleeping pills either. So this diabetes
comes by over-thinking and can be easily cured

34:19.530 --> 34:25.099
if you can take to Sahaja Yoga, which I’ll
tell you how we’ll stop our thinking at

34:25.099 --> 34:30.139
this, I’ve already told you, at this point.

34:30.139 --> 34:35.210
Then the third disease which is even more
dangerous than this, is the disease which

34:35.210 --> 34:42.210
we call as blood cancer. Blood cancer is caused
only to people who think too much. It can

34:43.810 --> 34:50.040
even be to the children if the mother is very
meticulous, particular about her carpets or

34:50.040 --> 34:54.839
her house, everything you know and even a
rat doesn’t enter that house. But she is

34:54.839 --> 34:59.970
very careful that all her things are properly
done, her sink doesn’t have even so much

34:59.970 --> 35:06.970
of, little bit of a spot left in it. All the
time, thinking, planning, thinking, planning.

35:10.920 --> 35:17.920
This affects the child and a child also can
get blood cancer. Blood cancer you get it

35:19.329 --> 35:26.089
because your spleen is a speedometer- is the
one which gives you the rhythm of life, rhythm

35:26.089 --> 35:33.089
of life. Now when we are hectic people, all
the time under shock, then this goes out of

35:37.030 --> 35:38.990
order.

35:38.990 --> 35:45.990
For example in the morning we get up and see
the newspaper and what you find, these Iranians

35:49.700 --> 35:56.700
have killed someone – such a shock. Then
an accident, then… I mean newspaper will

35:57.579 --> 36:04.450
never give good news, will they? Will they
give news, how many people got realization

36:04.450 --> 36:10.990
or something is working out all, all right?
No something horrible that should shock your

36:10.990 --> 36:17.990
heads, shock your limbic area – otherwise
you’ll not take it seriously. So, once you

36:18.099 --> 36:24.920
read that, you don’t know your system is
a very delicate system, it gets a shock. And

36:24.920 --> 36:28.970
then you get into your car, without taking
your breakfast, or maybe in your hand is the

36:28.970 --> 36:33.900
breakfast because you are late. On the way
there is a jam – you are shouting, screaming

36:33.900 --> 36:40.900
- somehow or other you reach the office and
there is the boss barking.

36:42.600 --> 36:49.600
This is how we live, under complete tension.
We are supposed to be free people. In the

36:50.050 --> 36:57.050
night if you sing loudly the neighbor will
come and put you to the police station. I

36:57.390 --> 37:04.390
mean you can’t do anything. There’s no
freedom. You have to be bound by the watch.

37:05.120 --> 37:11.840
This is the time, exact you have to reach
there. So all these things, pressures, and

37:11.840 --> 37:18.840
all these things work on us and we become
hectic. And for emergency, this spleen is

37:21.520 --> 37:28.520
the one which releases red blood corpuscles
– RBCs. But if you are all the time like

37:28.870 --> 37:35.870
this hectic, that poor spleen becomes mad.
It doesn’t know what to do. It starts producing

37:38.120 --> 37:45.120
more cells, more cells and then it thinks
it’s a mad person I am fixed with because

37:45.350 --> 37:47.580
I don’t know when to act, when not to act.

37:47.580 --> 37:52.250
So the vulnerability is there, and suddenly
with some other shock, you might get blood

37:52.250 --> 37:58.600
cancer and then the doctors will certify you
are going to die after one month. Finished,

37:58.600 --> 38:05.600
prepare for your burial. And the whole house
is crying. But we have cured, I mean Sahaja

38:10.450 --> 38:17.450
Yoga has cured blood cancer of many people
just by this Kundalini awakening because as

38:22.650 --> 38:28.810
soon as the Kundalini is awakened, too much
movement this side and that side, this all

38:28.810 --> 38:33.520
the time going on, in the center – this
is the left and the right side of the sympathetic

38:33.520 --> 38:40.520
– so just the Kundalini passes through,
strings through and brings it back and nourishes

38:43.590 --> 38:50.590
it. The problem is over. And though they were
certified to be dead, after even four years

38:51.800 --> 38:58.800
they are all right, working all right, the
certificate is cancelled. Even vulnerability

39:04.540 --> 39:11.540
to cancer, or to all incurable diseases, are
because of these centers going out of place.

39:17.550 --> 39:24.550
Now we have the center which we call here
as the heart center. It controls the left

39:25.890 --> 39:32.890
and right, both – so we have a left and
right heart in Sahaja Yoga. As you know that,

39:38.220 --> 39:45.220
this sternum bone creates the antibodies for
you. And these antibodies fight your diseases.

39:49.740 --> 39:56.740
So when this center goes out, this is the
center which sends all the messages to these

40:00.350 --> 40:07.350
antibodies. Now this is the center of a mother.
When your motherhood is challenged, you develop

40:13.050 --> 40:15.290
breast cancer.

40:15.290 --> 40:22.290
Supposing a man is a flirt and his wife is
worried, she might get a breast cancer, because

40:23.870 --> 40:30.870
her motherhood is challenged and her sense
of security is very disturbed. As a result

40:37.600 --> 40:44.600
of that, she gets this problem. Also if you
are too much of a thinker, and you think too

40:48.260 --> 40:54.040
much and you’re very, what we call the right-sided,
the futuristic planner, I mean people plan

40:54.040 --> 41:01.040
it for ten years. They plan even their deaths,
what dress they are going to wear and where

41:01.670 --> 41:08.670
they are going to be buried, up to that point.
All this futuristic planning creates such

41:11.250 --> 41:18.250
tremendous heat in the body because the liver,
which is supposed to absorb all the heat,

41:19.310 --> 41:26.310
is neglected by this center. As a result that
heat travels up and you develop asthma. Now

41:28.250 --> 41:35.250
we had yesterday, at least five or six people
who came with asthma. Asthma is absolutely

41:37.900 --> 41:43.980
curable. But do you know this is the center
of a husband, or of the father. Now if I am

41:43.980 --> 41:47.980
telling you, you should not be shocked, because
later on you’ll find it.

41:47.980 --> 41:54.980
Now if you are a bad husband, you can get
asthma. Or if your wife is a shrew, you might

41:55.700 --> 42:02.700
get an asthma. Or if you are a very bad father,
you might get an asthma. Or if your father

42:05.330 --> 42:12.330
is not kind to you, you might get an asthma.
If you have not forgiven your father, you

42:12.780 --> 42:19.020
might get asthma. Now can you believe it,
just forgiving your father, you can get out

42:19.020 --> 42:26.020
of your asthma permanently. Sahaja Yoga has
cured asthma of so many people. Believe it

42:26.650 --> 42:33.650
or not, it works. It looks so funny but our
relationships, our parents we have chosen

42:37.840 --> 42:44.460
when we came on this Earth. I know they are
wrong, they are obstinate, they’re headstrong,

42:44.460 --> 42:50.270
they may be drunkards, whatever they are.
But even if you leave them, because so many

42:50.270 --> 42:56.120
people leave the parents, still forgive them
and forget. Otherwise you carry the problems

42:56.120 --> 42:56.370
with you.

42:56.280 --> 43:03.280
The left heart is the place of the mother.
Now if your mother has been hard with you,

43:06.940 --> 43:13.940
if you have had very bad experiences, you
will have problems of the left heart. Center

43:14.410 --> 43:19.110
heart is very important where your sense of
security should be established. You’ll be

43:19.110 --> 43:25.160
surprised in the disease called AIDS, it is
the center heart which is out. We have tried

43:25.160 --> 43:31.910
to cure, and we cured also 3, 4 people from
AIDS, but they have no will-power to continue

43:31.910 --> 43:38.300
with Sahaja Yoga, they want to die. And they
have made a big martyrdom out of it, you see

43:38.300 --> 43:44.610
they are martyrs, great martyrs of a great
principle they have established. It’s impossible

43:44.610 --> 43:50.240
to convince to them, that this is unnatural
that you are doing and that you should give

43:50.240 --> 43:56.390
it up and you should live, why should you
die? No, we are martyrs for such a big principle

43:56.390 --> 44:03.390
we have established. To do something out of
the way and new is the modern fashion. Anything

44:03.770 --> 44:10.770
- will do something with the hair, with the
nose, with the eyes, with the ears, with the

44:11.990 --> 44:18.990
clothes. That’s all you can do. To such
an extent that they do not realize that whatever

44:21.690 --> 44:23.850
is new may not be good for you.

44:23.850 --> 44:29.050
For example, everyday we eat our dinner. Supposing
we want to eat the table because it is new

44:29.050 --> 44:36.050
– is it a sensible thing? Anything that
is new, is not good. But anything that is

44:37.280 --> 44:44.200
old, may not be good also. So you have to
have that wisdom which comes to you through

44:44.200 --> 44:50.150
Sahaja Yoga. There is no other way out - you
have to become the spirit, and you have to

44:50.150 --> 44:54.430
see in the light of the spirit, what is right
and what is wrong.

44:54.430 --> 45:01.430
So then wecome to this center which is, we
call as the Vishuddhi – this has sixteen

45:02.910 --> 45:08.820
petals, looks after the cervical plexus. Now
this is a very very important center and this

45:08.820 --> 45:15.240
is the center is for communication. For example,
when you talk, you communicate through your

45:15.240 --> 45:20.570
hands. You shake hands, you touch somebody,
and you can communicate. Even if you cannot

45:20.570 --> 45:27.570
talk, with your hands you can communicate.
Also when we think we are very responsible,

45:30.620 --> 45:37.620
this center goes out. Like some people were
traveling by plane - they were from villages,

45:38.910 --> 45:45.190
they did not know what was a plane. They were
told to take less luggage because it should

45:45.190 --> 45:51.040
not be a weight for the plane. So they got
into the plane and put all of the luggage

45:51.040 --> 45:58.040
on their heads. And they said that “We are
trying to reduce the weight of the plane.”

45:58.250 --> 46:05.250
In the same way, we are also... actually the
One - which is all-pervading power, which

46:05.880 --> 46:10.210
has created us, created this universe and
has brought us to this level of human beings

46:10.210 --> 46:17.210
- is doing everything. But we think we are
responsible, we have to do it. But once you

46:17.370 --> 46:24.370
become a Sahaja Yogi you just do it, no doubt.
But you don’t think that you are doing anything.

46:24.630 --> 46:30.660
You just say its happening. And what a beautiful
feeling it is. Then you don’t have blood

46:30.660 --> 46:37.660
pressures, you don’t have headaches, you
don’t have tensions – no, because we are

46:38.290 --> 46:45.290
not doing it. It is just done and you find
it’s all done.

46:46.090 --> 46:53.090
Now on this center when we come, as I’ve
told you, your thinking is controlled by you,

46:54.300 --> 47:00.520
you can control. If you want you can think
or you don’t think. But in that silence

47:00.520 --> 47:07.520
you feel your peace. If there’s too much
of crowds, too much of problems, suddenly

47:08.730 --> 47:15.730
you become the witness. You start seeing everything.
Seeing the problem, what it is. Unless and

47:18.190 --> 47:23.760
until you can see the problem you cannot solve
it. Because you are in the problem, you just

47:23.760 --> 47:29.880
get upset. But if you are out of the problem,
you can see it. And that’s what happens

47:29.880 --> 47:36.880
to you when you become thoughtlessly aware
when this center opens out.

47:37.140 --> 47:44.140
Last but not the least is the center of limbic
area which is very important. Now I do not

47:46.130 --> 47:53.130
know it has been discovered or not, but it
will be very soon discovered, that very strong

47:53.180 --> 47:59.790
things like cracks and all that have got sulfuric
acid in it, and that doesn’t go anywhere

47:59.790 --> 48:06.790
in the body, just rushes into the limbic area.
Now this limbic area is a hollow place which

48:07.570 --> 48:14.570
has got all cells here very sensitive to joy
and happiness. But they become numb, so numb

48:16.290 --> 48:22.490
that ordinary music you cannot hear - somebody
has to scream at you, has to shout at you,

48:22.490 --> 48:28.620
he has to jump on it, otherwise you cannot
enjoy. Then it has to be worse and worse and

48:28.620 --> 48:35.060
worse and worse… I don’t know now with
cracks, later on they might develop something

48:35.060 --> 48:42.060
even more poisonous, because it has to excite
this limbic area which is such an important

48:42.800 --> 48:49.800
thing. But as soon as the Kundalini enters
into that area, limbic area, she soothes it

48:51.420 --> 48:58.420
and it opens - opens like a lotus, thousand
petalled lotus. It opens and then the Kundalini

49:05.000 --> 49:12.000
emerges out of your fontanelle bone area and
gets connected to the all-pervading power.

49:12.650 --> 49:18.950
Then you start feeling the cool breeze in
your hands. You can feel it all over. Some

49:18.950 --> 49:24.580
people in the beginning who felt cool breeze,
could not believe it – so they closed doors,

49:24.580 --> 49:31.270
everything and sat down to see, still they
were feeling it. But it works, works in the

49:31.270 --> 49:38.270
sense that you get empowered. You become peaceful,
you become the witness, you become the wise

49:41.170 --> 49:47.550
and you become empowered that you can give
realizations to others like this, that you

49:47.550 --> 49:54.550
can raise the Kundalini like this and you
can establish that connection. You can do

49:55.570 --> 50:02.570
it. And this is what is your right to have
it. This is what will give you meaning. Otherwise

50:02.880 --> 50:09.600
so far whatever we have been doing is very
frustrating.

50:09.600 --> 50:15.050
Now yesterday I said some questions can be
asked but I haven’t seen any questions whatsoever.

50:15.050 --> 50:22.050
That means you have no questions? Or there
are some questions we can deal with it for

50:48.570 --> 50:55.570
about 5 minutes. There’s one there, please..

51:01.110 --> 51:08.110
Question: INAUDIBLE, but someone else (a yogi
near Mother?) repeats the question:

51:22.619 --> 51:27.420
[What is the process by which you one stops
thinking?]

51:27.420 --> 51:34.420
It’s very simple. When the Kundalini settles
down there, what happens, as I told you, there

51:35.950 --> 51:42.950
is Christ – Christ is awakened and He sucks
in these two institutions which you see there,

51:43.119 --> 51:50.119
the yellow and the blue. These are – one
is, the blue one is our conditioning and the

51:50.380 --> 51:57.380
yellow one is our ego. So both these are sucked
in like that. These are sucked in because

51:58.790 --> 52:05.790
it is said that He died for our sins, didn’t
He? He suffered for us. Now also that’s

52:06.650 --> 52:12.720
why yesterday I’ve said are we going to
suffer more than Him? We don’t have to suffer.

52:12.720 --> 52:19.720
Only awaken Him at Agnya. We are all right,
this is the process, it opens out. All right?

52:21.290 --> 52:28.290
That’s why I said you must forgive, because
He said you have to forgive and when you forgive

52:28.770 --> 52:32.490
you can ask for forgiveness, that’s why
we do both the things – one in the front

52:32.490 --> 52:38.380
and one in the back.

52:38.380 --> 52:39.670
Please get up.

52:39.670 --> 52:45.480
[How do you raise the Kundalini?]

52:45.480 --> 52:50.820
Automatically, I’ll tell you how. Please,
you see like if you have to sprout a seed

52:50.820 --> 52:55.150
you have to just put it in the Mother Earth.
How do you do it? The Mother Earth has got

52:55.150 --> 53:02.150
the capacity and the seed is built-in within
it. Now it is all built-in within you, all

53:03.510 --> 53:08.880
right. And just you are here, I can raise
it – anybody can raise it, those who have

53:08.880 --> 53:13.840
got the capacity – Sahaja Yogis can raise
your Kundalini also.

53:13.840 --> 53:20.840
[Question from the floor, : You talk about
always thinking. You talk about, like, if

53:21.960 --> 53:28.960
you think too much, you can actually create
illness and the problems in your life. How

53:33.810 --> 53:38.950
do You organize Your time and Your work and
everything, but You don’t think about it?]

53:38.950 --> 53:45.050
Oh, because the Divine Power does for Me.
Everything is done by Divine Power. Why should

53:45.050 --> 53:52.050
I think – let it think for Me. You see I
travel every day – I sleep at 2 o’clock

53:59.030 --> 54:06.030
in the night, get up about 5 o’clock in
the morning and I travel everywhere. And I’m

54:06.460 --> 54:12.900
now 67 years of age, all right, so what. Divine
Power is looking after Me, it’s working

54:12.900 --> 54:19.900
out everything. I am just moving about nicely
enjoying everything.

54:23.180 --> 54:30.180
But you have to believe that you can get realization.
You need not believe in the Divine Power,

54:36.690 --> 54:41.880
but you just first believe that you can get
realization and you get it and get in connection

54:41.880 --> 54:46.000
with it. It just works. It is the subtlest
of subtle.

54:46.000 --> 54:53.000
[Yogi, repeating the question: How can we
utilize the divine power in our relationships

54:55.720 --> 54:58.500
and all the problems?]

54:58.500 --> 55:05.500
You see first of all you have to give to others.
Unless and until you open one door, all right

55:07.300 --> 55:12.570
that’s Divine Power there. But unless and
until you open other door, it won’t come

55:12.570 --> 55:18.490
in your life. So you have to open the other
door also. There’s where we fail, we want

55:18.490 --> 55:25.490
to use Sahaja Yoga for our own purpose, for
our own – my brother, my sister, my son,

55:25.740 --> 55:32.740
all sorts of my, my, my… There there’s
problem – but open it out. Everything works

55:35.550 --> 55:42.550
out. You must learn to give. This is free.

55:46.130 --> 55:53.130
[Question inaudible]

55:53.340 --> 55:58.350
It is situated on top of the brain where it
is above the brain, and it is covered with,

55:58.350 --> 56:05.350
the doctors say that it is 988 nerves - because
I don’t want to quarrel with them. But there

56:09.290 --> 56:16.100
are 1000 nerves which cover it. And when it
is enlightened you’ll be surprised, you’ll

56:16.100 --> 56:23.100
see a beautiful lotus opening in all colors,
very very silent flames, and they are so peace-giving,

56:31.010 --> 56:38.010
looks so beautiful. Because when any nerve
gets enlightened, the light of that flame

56:43.060 --> 56:50.060
looks like a petal. It’s very beautiful,
it is. But it has to open out. Just now it

56:50.410 --> 56:57.109
is covered by our conditioning and our ego.
Like we have become like an egg we can say.

56:57.109 --> 57:02.170
That’s why in Sanskrit language, a person
who has known the brahma, the all-pervading

57:02.170 --> 57:09.170
power, is called as dvijaha and a bird is
also called as dvijaha - means born twice.

57:12.990 --> 57:19.990
First as an egg, then it becomes a bird – human
being and a realized soul. These are the two

58:25.410 --> 58:26.690
stages.

58:26.690 --> 58:29.260
[Question inaudible]

58:29.260 --> 58:36.260
You see the thing is that now there are social
conditions which are very bad, people are

58:36.430 --> 58:43.170
homeless, they are on the streets. Now thinking
about it you are not going to help them, are

58:43.170 --> 58:50.030
you? No. Which is the best way is to empower
yourself, all right? Now see for example,

58:50.030 --> 58:57.030
in the villages of India where I work, people
have given them alcohol, they have given up

59:00.030 --> 59:07.030
all bad habits, they have become very dynamic,
they have become very well off, they are living

59:07.050 --> 59:14.050
very well. In London, if you want to work,
I am sure you can get a home, no problem.

59:17.240 --> 59:21.850
You see the Asians who have come here, I am
an Asian though I didn’t come as an immigrant,

59:21.850 --> 59:28.850
they are becoming very rich, because they
work very hard, very hard, so those who want

59:29.290 --> 59:34.730
to… in London. But in India it may not be.
But despite that, after Sahaja Yoga they have

59:34.730 --> 59:41.050
improved so much – they have become so dynamic,
they have become so hopeful of life. But if

59:41.050 --> 59:48.050
you just think that life is good for nothing,
let us now drink and be merry then it won’t

59:49.250 --> 59:50.359
work out.

59:50.359 --> 59:55.200
These homeless and all these conditions are
all such – because it is an artificial condition

59:55.200 --> 01:00:02.200
you know, many people have houses but they
don’t want to give it for people to live.

01:00:02.350 --> 01:00:09.350
Now if those people get transformation, they
won’t behave like that. You see the whole

01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:14.980
behavior will change when the emancipation
of the society comes up. But I have seen in

01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:21.980
the villages of India there’s a complete
transformation. The social conditions are

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:29.340
much worse but Indians are more satisfied
people, they are not so much. Here even, supposing

01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:34.960
you offer a house, they will say, “No, I
don’t like this house.” You offer a job,

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:38.980
they’ll say, “I don’t want this job.”
All these things are there – also too much

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:45.980
of choices. But if you decide, London is not
difficult place I tell you to work hard and

01:00:46.350 --> 01:00:53.350
get a house, not difficult, they can do it.
But people don’t work here, don’t work.

01:00:54.690 --> 01:01:00.410
There are so many old people who haven’t
got anybody to help them. But these people

01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:07.090
will never go and help them. They can earn.
This is a place where anybody can earn I think,

01:01:07.090 --> 01:01:12.180
because I know people, Asians, who have come
here without any money are very rich today

01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:18.780
- all have got big big cars, nice houses,
this, that. You can see that they are very

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:19.230
hardworking.

01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:24.970
And then divorces, everybody third day if
you divorce someone what will happen to you?

01:01:24.970 --> 01:01:29.700
You’ll end up without a home. No respect
for the wife, the wife has no respect for

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:36.700
the house. All upside down society. There’s
a big quarrel going on between husband and

01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:42.200
wife – how can you have a home with this
husband and wife fighting? Even TV if you

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:47.800
open, nothing but fighting - you just don’t
want to hear anyone. See we had to decide

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:54.080
on certain things – that if we have to make
a home, then we have to understand our role

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:54.920
in life.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:02:01.920
For a woman and a man, I agree, they are equal,
no doubt. But they are like two wheels of

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:09.990
a chariot which has some distance but they
are not similar. And no use fighting with

01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:14.650
each other – when you can’t live without
each other, why should you fight? And the

01:02:14.650 --> 01:02:21.650
children are on the streets. Every child I
find 18 years of age is out of the house.

01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:28.540
I mean here the little children are killed
– why? In India, I cannot think of such

01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:35.540
a thing. The reason, though they are very
poor, the reason is they know what is love.

01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:43.609
And that is what I feel that the society has
to little bit take to Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:43.609 --> 01:02:50.430
Now we have so many marriages in Sahaja Yoga
– I mean 1% marriages fail, 1%. They have

01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:55.350
beautiful children, they are living very well,
they have good houses. Those who were really

01:02:55.350 --> 01:03:02.350
hippies had nothing, are having nice houses
and everything they have. Also some of them,

01:03:03.310 --> 01:03:10.310
were “Oh, so I am now fortunately, I am
without job.” And I said, “What, you are

01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:17.180
very fortunate?” “Yea, now I am without
job. Very happy about it.” So I told the

01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:24.180
gentleman that if you are not going to stick
to one job, you are not going to come to Sahaja

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:31.840
Yoga. And that fellow today has a big car,
a nice wife, children and a house.

01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:41.770
So all these ideas of stupid freedom must
be given up. One has to come to a balance

01:03:46.119 --> 01:03:53.119
and value your life. You must value it. Human
life is very valuable. With what great difficulty

01:03:54.960 --> 01:04:01.960
God has created you and what are we doing
with it? The whole society has to take a turn

01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:20.780
and think of living happily – if the husband
and wife, I mean such a relationship, husband

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:29.500
and wife cannot live together, then how do
we expect this world to have United Nations?

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:33.920
We cannot – it is falsehood.

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:40.920
In Sahaja Yoga we don’t have divorces – we
have sometimes, sometimes we have, is allowed.

01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:53.070
But that is mostly when they are married beforehand
– fallen in love, now they are rising in

01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:56.869
love, falling in love again, again falling,
rising in love again… how many times they

01:04:56.869 --> 01:05:03.869
fall in love God only knows. It’s a funny
stuff going on. We have to face the reality.

01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:14.369
So just worrying about these things, what
we should do, is to first of all become wise

01:05:14.369 --> 01:05:21.369
and understand the problems. We can all solve
it. It is very simple, it is very simple to

01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:24.830
solve the problems.

01:05:24.830 --> 01:05:31.830
First of all we have to enter into the Kingdom
of God. And secondly, that it solves your

01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:42.599
problems. Just worrying about poor people,
it’s also a kind of a fashion these days.

01:05:42.599 --> 01:05:47.470
Because when I went to Switzerland, I met
a lady. She said, “I am very guilty.”

01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:48.460
I said, “Why?”

01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:49.210
“Because of Afghanistan.”

01:05:49.210 --> 01:05:50.359
I said, “Are you Afghani?”

01:05:50.359 --> 01:05:53.160
“No, but I am guilty about Afghanistan.”

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:57.500
“What have you got to do with Afghanistan?”

01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:58.040
“Nothing.”

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:05.040
So it’s kind of an idea - what are we doing
about it? But a Sahaja Yogi does, Sahaja Yogi

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:15.080
finds out ways and methods of creating a convenient
life – a life where you can earn, you can

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:28.560
live… we do it – we have done, I have
so many examples. Because it’s a collective

01:06:31.410 --> 01:06:38.240
life also you help each other. We didn’t
have rich people in Sahaja Yoga many because

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:43.099
they seldom come to Sahaja Yoga. They go to
false gurus because they can purchase the

01:06:43.099 --> 01:06:50.099
guru – they can’t purchase Me. So mostly
the rich never come here. Bureaucrats also

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:56.700
don’t come, politicians don’t come. So
those people who come to Me are the people

01:06:56.700 --> 01:07:03.700
who can easily solve the problem because they
are so collective, they can solve the problem.

01:07:07.810 --> 01:07:14.810
You’ll be surprised, I went to Turkey – My
husband was not so for it – everybody said,

01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:23.050
“That’s a Muslim country, this, that.”
I went to a Muslim country that was Turkey,

01:07:23.050 --> 01:07:30.050
and a woman, I just said I must go. But I
was surprised, they worshipped Mother, they

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:37.930
worshipped their mothers. And they were so
beautiful – so many. In one shot, we got

01:07:37.930 --> 01:07:44.930
70 people – serious Sahaja Yogis. But do
you know when I reached there, people from

01:07:45.450 --> 01:07:52.450
America, from Australia, from all over the
world arrived there in Turkey to help Me.

01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:58.920
I mean I was so enamored to see My children
coming, arriving there on their own - those

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:05.920
who could afford it. And the Turkish people
were so beautiful, I tell you. I found they

01:08:06.930 --> 01:08:09.000
are the same everywhere.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:16.000
There’s only a skin deep difference, I tell
you, otherwise we are just the same. So all

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:25.000
these problems can be easily solved – there’s
nothing so serious about it. There is

01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:07.650
a very great thing no doubt, but unless and
until you are connected, it is like telephoning

01:09:16.270 --> 01:09:23.270
without connection. There are people in India
who’ll go on saying “Rama Rama Rama Rama

01:09:27.279 --> 01:09:33.210
Rama” like that. And the chakra of Rama
itself will be caught. They’ll be saying

01:09:33.210 --> 01:09:39.540
“Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva” and the heart
chakra, where Shiva resides, it will be caught.

01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:46.540
The reason is, supposing you want to meet
the Queen – now if you go to Buckingham

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:55.810
Palace and go on saying “Elizabeth, Elizabeth,
Elizabeth” – you’ll be arrested! And

01:09:55.810 --> 01:10:02.810
you’ll end up in a jail!

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:12.400
So you must have some connection, there should
be some protocol. Now if it is for kings and

01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:25.050
prime ministers, what about God? He’s not
in your pocket. But once you are realized,

01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:34.020
even once you take the name, it is sufficient.
What is there? He’s at your disposal all

01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:41.020
the time there. But you have to have connection.
Now you are the citizens say of England, or

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:46.570
some place, all right so your government is
looking after you. Whether you are satisfied

01:10:46.570 --> 01:10:51.980
or not is not the point. But they are looking
after you. But if you enter into the Kingdom

01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:58.980
of God, then see the efficiency of this Kingdom.
You’ll be amazed if I tell you how things

01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:09.980
work out. So amazing

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:48.920
it is, so amazing. See first of all they say
Kundalini has to rise. Then it sometimes comes

01:11:55.690 --> 01:12:02.690
back to the centers which are needing more
help. So it is like a rope you can say, which

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:10.400
has many strings in it, very thin ones just
like a hair, and one by one they open out.

01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:20.780
So first, very few of them pierce through,
open out the Sahasrara, by which you relax

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:29.500
and the chakras open out more. It goes on
like that. But once you are connected properly

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:38.040
then there’s no problem. But it is instantaneous,
no doubt about it. But for that you have to

01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:49.110
come to our centers, don’t have to pay anything,
just spend some time and you have to master

01:12:50.070 --> 01:12:52.950
it, that’s all.

01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:59.950
There’s a question, what purpose do we have
on this planet?

01:13:01.469 --> 01:13:08.469
The purpose of our existence is to prove that
God’s creation is the most successful thing.

01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:20.320
That’s the purpose.

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:27.320
About Me, I will not talk - I am sorry. You
better get your realization and try to find

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:50.020
out about Me, because those who have talked
- you see human beings are mad people, you

01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:56.540
don’t know. Christ said “I am the Son
of God” – which He was no doubt. And He

01:13:56.540 --> 01:14:02.670
saidthat, “I am the door” – which He
was, no doubt. But they crucified Him. They

01:14:02.670 --> 01:14:09.540
gave poison to Mohammed Sahib. They killed
so many saints. I know human beings very well,

01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:15.639
so please I am not going to talk to you about
Myself at all. You better get your self-realization

01:14:15.639 --> 01:14:22.639
- try to know Me. Because I have to do some
jobs, all right and for that, I want to live.

01:14:27.739 --> 01:14:34.739
People are really sometimes so funny. Even
otherwise they behave in such a funny manner

01:14:35.130 --> 01:14:41.460
that I can’t understand. As if I am going
to take away their property or something.

01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:48.460
I am here to give you something that is very
important. Sort of you can say I am here to

01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:56.750
complete the work of Christ, Mohammed and
all of them.

01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:15.940
Yes please…. When you will give to others,
you will receive the blessings. That’s what

01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:44.830
it is absolutely 100%. He said so many things.
I mean just explaining Sahaja Yoga throughout

01:15:45.650 --> 01:15:51.070
I think.

01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:58.070
[Question inaudible]

01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:08.860
That

01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:21.000
should not be the question just now, all right.
Because to say anything about it, you know

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:28.000
what happens with people. So this can be discussed
later on, when we get our self-realization.

01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:37.070
Certain things at a level can be discussed
and this is what happened with all of them

01:16:37.410 --> 01:16:44.410
because they had very little time to talk
to you. And that’s why everything has been

01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:51.920
misinterpreted, misused, because to understand
the truth, to bear it also, one has to have

01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:04.760
self-realization. This I have found out. If
you are not a self realized person you can’t

01:17:05.290 --> 01:17:12.290
bear the truth, you cannot – it’s too
much for human mind to grasp and to allow

01:17:14.210 --> 01:17:21.210
it to be a part and parcel of their understanding.
Truth is too much for them.

01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:29.620
So the first thing should be that we get our
self-realization. Yes, my child…

01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:31.420
[Initial question inaudible.

01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:37.060
Mother: Can you get up, please?

01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:43.590
Questioner: Yes, of course

01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:48.489
Mother: Thank you.

01:17:48.489 --> 01:17:55.489
Questioner: Do the colors of the chakras change
all the time?[… INAUDIBLE]

01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:08.550
But the auras you see sometimes are these
colors only. But sometimes you are more strong

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:15.550
with one center, so that color shows. They
do not change, they are just the same.

01:18:18.239 --> 01:18:22.940
All right I think now it is 10 o’clock so
we’ll take about 10 minutes more and let

01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:29.810
us finish with our self-realization which
is going to take only 10 minutes. Those who

01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:36.680
do not want to have should please leave, they
should not sit here and just watch other people.

01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:43.160
That’s the only kindness I request of them
– that if you do not want to have self-realization,

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:49.790
it’s better that you should leave. Those
people who are standing, could not get place,

01:18:49.790 --> 01:18:56.790
can come here or you can also give them places
if you want to give some places. No, not for

01:18:57.620 --> 01:19:02.620
Sahaja Yogis, I said for others – for others,
for outsiders, Sahaja Yogis can stand up.

01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:09.620
At the very outset you have to now understand
that we are going to enter into the Kingdom

01:19:45.739 --> 01:19:52.739
of God and hence we have to little bit unload
ourselves. One of the conditions is that we

01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:11.290
should not feel guilty – one should not
feel guilty at all. Yesterday, same problem

01:20:11.290 --> 01:20:17.450
I said, but you were still feeling guilty.
Also it’s a fashion. Also I think the language

01:20:17.450 --> 01:20:22.350
is such – all the time sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry… Even when we used to receive telephones

01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:26.950
we used to say “I beg your pardon.” But
now it is sorry, sorry, sorry – ten times

01:20:26.950 --> 01:20:33.000
sorry. What is there to be so sorry?

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:38.250
So we have to be pleasantly placed towards
ourselves. We have to respect ourselves. We

01:20:38.250 --> 01:20:45.250
have to be happy about ourselves. This is
first thing is not to feel guilty about anything

01:20:45.690 --> 01:20:52.690
- just believe that you have done nothing
wrong which cannot be dissolved by this great

01:20:53.930 --> 01:21:00.930
power of forgiveness. Please believe Me. But
if you want to stick onto a feeling like that

01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:08.980
– “No, no, I am guilty” – it’s only
mental. Animals don’t feel guilty about

01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:16.480
anything – a dog will bark, tiger will eat
anything that it wants to. It’s only human

01:21:16.690 --> 01:21:22.440
beings who feel that way – that I’ve done
this wrong, I’ve done that wrong. All right,

01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:26.400
so not to feel guilty that’s one point.

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:33.400
The second one is to forgive everyone, which
is very difficult for many people. I don’t

01:21:38.670 --> 01:21:45.670
know how many mounds of unhappiness is in
the head because we cannot forgive. Mounds,

01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:53.020
it’s not kilos and kilos. Yesterday I found
most of them had not forgiven and I had to

01:21:56.730 --> 01:22:03.730
go on putting balm on their heads to take
out. So you must cooperate. Just forgive,

01:22:04.239 --> 01:22:11.239
just forgive everyone. First of all forgive
yourself and forgive everyone. And be pleasantly

01:22:16.210 --> 01:22:21.370
placed towards yourself. There’s no Greek
tragedy going on here – no tragedy. We are

01:22:21.370 --> 01:22:28.370
in a very beautiful atmosphere and we are
going to go into the most beautiful area within

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:39.280
ourselves, that is our spirit. So we have
to be very light about it.

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:47.520
All right, with all this understanding, I
have to request you that we have to take out

01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:56.830
your shoes because this Mother Earth also
helps us a lot. And not to be serious – not

01:23:13.070 --> 01:23:20.070
to be serious about it. It’s not frivolous,
but it’s fun.

01:23:31.730 --> 01:23:38.730
So you have to put your left hand towards
Me, which represents your desire to get realization.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:57.000
If all the Sahaja Yogis could also sit down
it would be very nice. Please be seated and

01:23:58.050 --> 01:24:04.000
don’t move about. Left hand towards Me like
that – be comfortable, if you want you can

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:10.350
put it on your lap or you can put it up if
you want to. Then the right hand needs to

01:24:10.350 --> 01:24:17.350
be used for nourishing your centers on the
left-hand side. Now I’ll show you how we’ll

01:24:24.050 --> 01:24:29.690
be nourishing. Before that, please remember
that put your both the feet apart from each

01:24:29.690 --> 01:24:36.690
other – not too much, but slightly. Now,
left hand towards Me. I’ll show you before

01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:47.350
and then we can close our eyes and work it
out.

01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:54.350
Put your right hand on your heart – in the
heart resides the Spirit and Kundalini is

01:25:00.190 --> 01:25:07.190
the reflection of the Holy Ghost, of the Adi
Shakti, within us, while the Spirit is the

01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:15.420
reflection of God Almighty. So we put our
attention to our heart first. Then we take

01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:29.020
our right hand in the upper portion of our
abdomen on the left-hand side and press it

01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:36.900
hard. This is the center of our mastery. We
take down our right hand on the lower portion

01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:45.300
of our abdomen and press it hard. This is
the center of pure knowledge that manifests

01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:55.860
on our central nervous system. We take back
our hand in the upper portion of our abdomen.

01:26:05.150 --> 01:26:12.150
And again we take it in the heart, in the
upper portion of our heart. Then we take it

01:26:15.410 --> 01:26:22.410
in the corner of our neck and our shoulder
and put your head to the right. This is the

01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:35.920
center we catch when we feel guilty. Then
we take our hand on our forehead and slowly

01:26:44.170 --> 01:26:51.170
bring down our head on it to rest. Here we
press it on both the sides and this is the

01:26:54.940 --> 01:27:01.940
center to forgive. We take back our hand on
the back side of our head and put our head

01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:17.680
resting on it - this is the center for asking
forgiveness without feeling guilty. We stretch

01:27:20.670 --> 01:27:27.670
our hand, with the center of our palm, we
put it on our head in the soft bone area of

01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:38.460
our childhood, called as fontanelle bone area,
and slowly we put down our head. Here we stretch

01:27:40.090 --> 01:27:47.090
our fingers and move our scalp carefully with
pressure, slowly, clockwise, seven times.

01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:07.380
That’s all we have to do.

01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:25.920
Now please close your eyes and don’t open
them until I ask you to open because attention

01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:34.560
has to go inside. Put your left hand towards
Me. Now first you will feel thoughtless – so

01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:40.250
don’t fight with your thoughts. Automatically
everything will work out. Don’t fight with

01:28:40.250 --> 01:28:47.250
your thoughts, just keep watching and ultimately
you will feel cool breeze coming out of your

01:28:49.090 --> 01:28:55.160
fontanelle bone area and you’ll also start
feeling cool breeze all around you which is

01:28:55.160 --> 01:29:01.770
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, the cool
breeze of the all-pervading power as described

01:29:01.770 --> 01:29:08.770
by Adi Shankaracharya, Salilam, salilam – it’s
cool, and cool.

01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:16.400
So now, we put our left hand this way towards
Me and the right hand on the heart. Here you

01:29:23.239 --> 01:29:30.239
have to ask Me a very fundamental question,
three times – “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:40.500
In your heart, ask the question “Mother,
am I the Spirit?” If you are the spirit

01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:55.090
you are your master, because in the light
of your spirit you know what is right and

01:29:55.090 --> 01:29:58.730
what is wrong – you can guide yourself.

01:29:58.730 --> 01:30:05.510
So put your right hand in the upper portion
of your abdomen on the left-hand side, and

01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:12.510
here please ask Me a question again three
times – “Mother, am I my own master?”

01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:23.300
“Mother, am I my own master?”

01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:32.800
As I have told you that I will not cross your
freedom, I respect your freedom, and only

01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:43.760
if you want I can bestow this pure knowledge
on yourself, otherwise I cannot. So please

01:30:47.180 --> 01:30:54.180
put your right hand in the lower portion of
your abdomen and ask the question, “Mother”

01:30:56.040 --> 01:31:03.040
- or you can request “Mother please give
me pure knowledge.” Say this six times because

01:31:13.390 --> 01:31:20.390
this center has got six petals. “Mother,
please give me pure knowledge.”

01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:36.830
Now all the prophets of the past and the saints
and seers have built up for us a center of

01:31:42.110 --> 01:31:49.110
mastery. But to open the center we have to
have all the confidence, so please raise your

01:31:54.410 --> 01:32:01.410
hand and put it in the upper portion of your
abdomen on the left-hand side and say with

01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:10.050
full confidence to nourish this center, ten
times, “Mother, I am my own master.” Please

01:32:19.810 --> 01:32:26.810
say this ten times.

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:39.680
Now we have to know that we are not this body,
we are not this mind, we are not these emotions,

01:32:46.090 --> 01:32:53.090
we are not this intellect. We are not our
conditionings or are we our ego. We are pure

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:05.530
spirit. So now raise your hand to your heart
and with full confidence say twelve times

01:33:05.530 --> 01:33:12.530
“Mother, I am the spirit.” Please say
twelve times, “Mother, I am the spirit.”

01:33:21.710 --> 01:33:28.710
You have to know that this Divine Power is
the ocean of love and compassion. It is the

01:33:36.219 --> 01:33:43.219
ocean of joy and bliss but above all it is
the ocean of forgiveness, so there is no mistake

01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:54.500
that you have committed which cannot be dissolved
by this ocean. So please forgive yourself

01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:06.280
and put your right hand in the corner of your
neck and your shoulder and turn your head

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:15.040
to your right. Here you have to say with complete
confidence again, “Shri Mataji, I am not

01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:29.550
guilty at all.” Or you can call Me Mother
– “Mother, I am not guilty at all.”

01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:51.120
Sixteen times- please say this sixteen times.

01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:06.560
Now one has to know whether you forgive someone
or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything

01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:19.800
– it’s a myth. But if you don’t forgive,
then you play into wrong hands. So put your

01:35:20.250 --> 01:35:27.250
right hand on your forehead and please bend
your head, resting on the hand as much as

01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:39.120
you can and now press it on both the sides.
And here please, please, say it from your

01:35:42.420 --> 01:35:49.420
heart “Mother, I forgive everyone.” Please
say it from your heart - please say it, otherwise

01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:59.830
again I will have to work very hard on you.
So please say it from your heart – “Mother,

01:35:59.830 --> 01:36:06.810
I forgive everyone.” You are not going to
miss your self-realization for not forgiving,

01:36:06.810 --> 01:36:13.810
please. How many lives you have been seeking
the truth that this time you are not going

01:36:22.780 --> 01:36:25.250
to miss it out.

01:36:25.250 --> 01:36:32.250
Now take back your hand on the back side of
your head and push back

01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:25.820
your head as much as you can resting on
your

01:39:24.980 --> 01:39:31.980
hand

01:39:55.390 --> 01:40:02.390
and here for your own satisfaction, without
feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

01:40:19.070 --> 01:40:26.070
please say, “Oh Divine, if

01:40:37.750 --> 01:40:44.750
I

01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:17.160
have done any mistakes, please forgive me.”

01:41:35.239 --> 01:41:42.239
TAPE ENDS
