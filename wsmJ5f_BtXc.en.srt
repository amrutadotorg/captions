1
01:04:28,891 --> 01:04:33,661
There is a divorce possible, both for the husband, also for wife.

2
01:04:33,798 --> 01:04:36,588
But that's very very rare, extremely rare, 

3
01:04:36,708 --> 01:04:39,208
so far I have seen is very rare.

4
01:04:39,350 --> 01:04:48,270
So one should marry with a very open heart
because you are marrying in Sahaja Yoga.

5
01:04:48,270 --> 01:04:56,720
Is no other binding force for you but your
love and affection and care for each other.

6
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:04,210
Now as you have got a bride and you have got
a husband I will tell you one thing that Sahaja

7
01:05:04,210 --> 01:05:15,240
Yoga will grow much more now because of you
being there as couples who follow Sahaja Yoga,

8
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:19,920
and who will have children of very great spiritual
character.

9
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:24,600
There are many saints who want to be born
on this Earth.

10
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:30,799
All these saints will be born to you, because
you are Sahaja Yogis and you are at a level

11
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:39,049
of that great consciousness which we call
as Atma Sakshatkar (Self-realisation).

12
01:05:39,099 --> 01:05:43,089
Or they call it (Bali?) in their language, (Bali?) 

13
01:05:43,169 --> 01:05:46,559
or (?) all these words are there 

14
01:05:46,579 --> 01:05:48,722
depending on the quality.

15
01:05:48,749 --> 01:05:53,309
So, with this idea you are doing a great work, 

16
01:05:53,802 --> 01:05:57,872
great thing to allow these great souls to come on this Earth,

17
01:05:58,032 --> 01:06:02,792
but your life also should be absolutely clean, Nirmala. 

18
01:06:02,842 --> 01:06:07,439
Try to be very kind to each other and nice to each other,

19
01:06:07,504 --> 01:06:11,279
is very easy in Sahaja Yoga, because 

20
01:06:11,779 --> 01:06:14,665
as you know that everything that you think, 

21
01:06:14,705 --> 01:06:20,016
everything that you do is all Sahaja. 

22
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:24,886
So there is no question of any problems coming in. 

23
01:06:26,068 --> 01:06:34,668
I wish you all very great love, prosperity
and joy and that you all develop in Sahaja

24
01:06:34,668 --> 01:06:41,368
Yoga in a very great love and understanding;
forgetting what is what was your past what

25
01:06:41,368 --> 01:06:48,759
was your religion, what was your caste, what
was your country.

26
01:06:48,798 --> 01:06:50,179
Forget everything!

27
01:06:50,179 --> 01:06:56,707
We are all really human beings and now we
are realised souls so there is no difference

28
01:06:56,707 --> 01:06:57,918
like this.

29
01:06:57,918 --> 01:07:03,777
And all of you should prosper in such a manner
that other people should see you and try to

30
01:07:03,777 --> 01:07:04,938
follow you.

31
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:08,438
It’s a big, very big responsibility.

32
01:07:08,438 --> 01:07:11,438
I hope you understand and realise.

33
01:07:11,438 --> 01:07:21,317
Thank you, may God bless you.

34
01:07:21,317 --> 01:07:29,417
Now, first thing you have to do is to accept
the Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

35
01:07:29,417 --> 01:07:39,119
This is the religion which is a universal
religion which encompasses all the religions,

36
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:46,120
respects all the great incarnations, knows
about them and all the good things that are

37
01:07:46,144 --> 01:07:49,903
told in all the religions it accepts.

38
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:55,630
It’s one religion which is not outside.

39
01:07:55,661 --> 01:07:58,430
Outside religions have created problems.

40
01:07:58,430 --> 01:08:05,997
You know they just create differences and
divides people, it’s divisiveness, divides

41
01:08:06,011 --> 01:08:07,091
people.

42
01:08:07,111 --> 01:08:08,781
But this is one religion.

43
01:08:08,837 --> 01:08:14,846
But this one religion was there amongst sufis
among all the saints.

44
01:08:14,846 --> 01:08:22,566
All those people who were born realised souls,
they had the same religion and that religion

45
01:08:22,566 --> 01:08:24,437
of humanity we follow.

46
01:08:24,437 --> 01:08:27,997
This religion is not outside it is inside.

47
01:08:27,997 --> 01:08:32,127
It’s inside, within yourself; is awakened.

48
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:36,326
And here we respect all the great incarnations.

49
01:08:36,326 --> 01:08:40,926
All the great religions we respect, not only
that [but] we follow [them].

50
01:08:40,926 --> 01:08:45,167
But we do not believe in any differentiation
or superiority.

51
01:08:45,167 --> 01:08:51,517
So, first, we have to accept that you belong
to this religion then there won’t be any

52
01:08:51,517 --> 01:08:59,937
fights about small things, like, “I belong
to this caste, this community, this religion,

53
01:08:59,937 --> 01:09:01,767
this country,” nothing.

54
01:09:01,767 --> 01:09:08,896
You are beyond that, and thats what we have
to establish if you want to have real peace

55
01:09:08,896 --> 01:09:11,956
and joy and blessings of the Divine.

56
01:09:11,956 --> 01:09:17,826
So this is the first thing that we have to
do [in the marriage vows], is to accept.

57
01:09:20,246 --> 01:09:25,016
And this we do it in the presence of fire.

58
01:09:25,336 --> 01:09:30,696
Fire, because the fire burns out everything,

59
01:09:30,876 --> 01:09:35,866
The fire rises above gravity, that's the only thing that rises above gravity.

60
01:09:35,876 --> 01:09:40,736
And that, we worship fire, we have worshipped innocence

61
01:09:40,796 --> 01:09:44,238
We make it a witness of what we are doing. 

62
01:09:44,328 --> 01:09:49,488
So that this fire can completely clear

63
01:09:49,608 --> 01:09:56,668
all our problems, all our difficulties in life by giving this light. 

64
01:09:57,028 --> 01:10:01,638
Same fire can enlightened your life. 

65
01:10:01,808 --> 01:10:06,228
But if you go wrong the same fire can burn your life. 

66
01:10:06,398 --> 01:10:10,178
So be careful, this is what it is, it is to give you light

67
01:10:10,428 --> 01:10:12,928
 and  (show) you the right path.
