Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Bhagavati Mataji

00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:19.874
Shri Nirmala Devyai Namoh Namah.

00:03:20.082 --> 00:03:27.205
Shri Mataji: Why these twenty-one names are taken before every puja,

00:03:27.406 --> 00:03:30.562
even before the today renovation of it?

00:03:30.763 --> 00:03:35.607
First you have to worship Shri Ganesha.

00:03:35.808 --> 00:03:39.528
But even before worshipping why these names are taken,

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:43.147
is important to understand, everything has a why.

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:53.435
Because these are the twenty-one channels within your Sushumna,

00:03:53.636 --> 00:03:56.560
twenty-one channels, we should say, in this

00:03:56.761 --> 00:04:01.793
complete Ida, Pingala and Sushumna Nadi.

00:04:01.994 --> 00:04:05.415
So to raise you,

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:17.981
absolutely to give you the ascent, twenty- one channels in Ida, Pingala, Sushumna.

00:04:18.214 --> 00:04:21.916
So one would say seven channels in the Sushumna Nadi.

00:04:22.117 --> 00:04:30.920
But these seven channels are divided multiplied by seven into three.

00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:36.465
So every channel has got twenty-one (inner? Unclear) channels.

00:04:40.235 --> 00:04:46.226
So Sushumna Nadi has got also twenty-one channels.

00:04:47.315 --> 00:04:49.803
Left-hand side Nadis are as you know that –

00:04:50.004 --> 00:04:53.820
perhaps you know, I don’t know if you know the names or not.

00:04:54.068 --> 00:04:57.856
And the right hand side also, like Gayatri,

00:04:58.057 --> 00:05:02.621
Parvati and all these are on the righ hand side.

00:05:02.822 --> 00:05:09.980
And the left ones are called as Chamundi,

00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:15.413
and all these left-sided things, there are seven of them.

00:05:16.597 --> 00:05:25.695
Now, the central path has got twenty-one channels and has got twenty-one powers.

00:05:25.896 --> 00:05:30.567
And their deities are named

00:05:32.109 --> 00:05:36.789
according to the twenty-one aspects of Shri Vishnu.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.725
And that’s why these twenty-one aspects are first said,

00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:46.345
so that within you all these twenty-one channels are awakened.

00:05:46.546 --> 00:05:49.695
Within you, first of all.

00:05:49.896 --> 00:05:56.956
Puja is a double thing, that a cup has to be made

00:05:57.157 --> 00:06:02.201
and then this source has to be opened out.

00:06:02.402 --> 00:06:09.762
So you are the cup. The Sushumna is the channel you have by which you suck in.

00:06:09.963 --> 00:06:14.512
So to open the Sushumna these twenty-one names are said.

00:06:15.816 --> 00:06:19.684
Now, why first Shri Ganesha?

00:06:19.885 --> 00:06:26.625
Because Shri Ganesha is the beginning of the desire. And the end of the desire.

00:06:26.826 --> 00:06:29.892
You start with Ganesha and end up with Ganesha.

00:06:30.093 --> 00:06:32.259
And that’s why Shri Ganesha is worshipped.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.064
Is the other way round now, the source.

00:06:36.335 --> 00:06:40.616
When you direct your attention to the source you worship it,

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:49.375
and when you want to incite or open out your own being, then you chant it.

00:06:51.324 --> 00:06:55.168
This is the difference between worship and a mantra.

00:06:55.369 --> 00:07:00.047
If you just say mantra, you open yourself up.

00:07:00.248 --> 00:07:07.107
But when you worship and chant, then you tap the source.

00:07:07.911 --> 00:07:12.762
I don’t know if I’ve said this before or not.
Yogi: No, no, no. Shri Mataji: No? All right.

00:07:12.843 --> 00:07:15.330
That’s how you understand the puja part.

00:07:15.531 --> 00:07:23.172
Now, those who are newcomers, their cup is completely useless.

00:07:23.373 --> 00:07:26.653
And when you excite the deities, they get busy opening their cups,

00:07:26.854 --> 00:07:29.292
everybody’s cups also. So it’s a double work.

00:07:29.493 --> 00:07:33.302
But if your cup is ready, it’s very easy to fill in.

00:07:36.774 --> 00:07:43.760
So now these twenty-one names I think you should take 
again with the understanding, is better. All right.

00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:51.878
Pujari: Om Shri Keshavaya Namah, Om Shri Narayanaya Namah,

00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:58.596

Pujari: Now we have the mantra for pranayama.

00:09:08.777 --> 00:09:11.179
Shri Mataji: This is the Gayatri, the right side.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:16.818
Is the right side, and these are all the seven centers on physical level.

00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:20.969
Pujari: Pranayama. Shri Mataji: Pranayama is the same thing. Is for –

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:25.062
Prana is right side. It’s physical side. You are opening the right side.

00:09:25.143 --> 00:09:28.676
You see, this Gayatri mantra you say. Bhur Bhuva Swaha and all these things.

00:09:28.757 --> 00:09:31.864
Now, Bhu is Pruthvi, Bhuva is Antariksha,

00:09:32.065 --> 00:09:35.259
you see, like that, it’s all the centers [Pujari: “Swaha”],

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:40.193
the essence of the centers, you see? Now, Antariksha –

00:09:40.394 --> 00:09:43.501
you’ll be surprised that you are the essence of all the Antariksha,

00:09:43.702 --> 00:09:47.481
your centers are. Yes.

00:09:51.747 --> 00:09:54.942

00:09:55.142 --> 00:10:03.750
Paramatma Devata, Devi Gayatri chandah. Pranayame viniyogah.”

00:10:19.224 --> 00:10:23.154
Shri Mataji: You do it only with the one nose? Yogi: Both noses. (Not audible)

00:10:23.235 --> 00:10:26.915
Shri Mataji: Both the noses. Prana: Prana is right side.

00:10:26.996 --> 00:10:29.819
Prana shakti is right side, Mana shakti is left side.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:33.917
So Prana shakti you are exciting

00:10:34.768 --> 00:10:39.775
because this prana is the one which spreads in the body,

00:10:39.976 --> 00:10:45.166
gives you the balance, which takes in and gives out.

00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:50.173
