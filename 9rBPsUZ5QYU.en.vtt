00:00:06.173 --> 00:00:10.293
Then we worship Gauri, that is the Kundalini,

00:00:10.373 --> 00:00:16.225
because through Kundalini only we get to our ascent.

00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:22.967
Kundalini is the power, residual power, of the Mahakali.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:26.077
And She is settled in the triangular bone, as you know,

00:00:26.157 --> 00:00:36.117
and is worshipped as a “Kanya”, because though She
is married, yet She’s a Virgin, so She’s worshipped there.

00:00:36.197 --> 00:00:41.106
After that, the Kundalini has to rise
through the central path of Sushumna

00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:47.756
which is guarded and nurtured by Mahalakshmi,

00:00:47.836 --> 00:00:52.774
so we have to worship Mahalakshmi’s force,
that’s how we worship Her.

00:00:52.854 --> 00:01:00.239
Through the Mahalakshmi we prepare
the path for Kundalini to cross over.

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:06.519
When the Kundalini crosses the
Mahalakshmi path, it comes up to the Sahasrara

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:13.343
and breaks the Brahmarandra, becoming
One with the All Pervading Power of Shiva Tattva.

00:01:13.423 --> 00:01:20.881
Because Sadashiva is on our
fontanelle bone – is, His Legs are resting

00:01:20.961 --> 00:01:23.762
on our fontanelle bone area.

00:01:23.842 --> 00:01:28.843
When the Kundalini touches His feet,

00:01:28.923 --> 00:01:38.452
then the Shiva Tattva in our heart, which is the
Spirit, is enlightened and we get the enlightenment.

00:01:38.532 --> 00:01:43.870
This is the yoga which we achieve through our Sahaja system.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.640
And that is why we have now worshipped the Mahalakshmi.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:57.644
After that, now we have to in… we have to
invite, avahana as they call it, innovation;

00:01:57.724 --> 00:02:01.565
invite the deity of Shiva and Parvati,

00:02:01.645 --> 00:02:12.539
and then we have to put our hearts to pour its love,

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:16.286
which is called as “abhisheka”, through the symbol of water.

00:02:16.366 --> 00:02:25.055
The… the water container is like a heart
which pours the water all the time on the Feet,

00:02:25.135 --> 00:02:30.134
showing that it is our heart which is pouring our love on
Shiva,

00:02:30.214 --> 00:02:34.675
by which we win Him over and call Him, invite Him.

00:02:34.755 --> 00:02:42.422
And after that, we will give Him what
He likes the most, is the Bel Patra,

00:02:42.502 --> 00:02:49.046
which is a leaf which has got three leaves on one stem,

00:02:49.126 --> 00:02:53.921
which means His three powers, Trigunatmika, three powers.

00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:58.442
So with our three powers, ours trigunas, our three powers,

00:02:58.522 --> 00:03:02.475
we surrender ourselves to Shiva and by that,

00:03:02.555 --> 00:03:09.099
we show that
we give our trigunas to You, so that we become gunateet.

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:13.592
This is what is the Shiva puja.

00:03:13.673 --> 00:03:15.859
May God bless you!
