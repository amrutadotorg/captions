1
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,800
I am very happy to see you all here.

2
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:12,390
I went to Iran in the year 1971, and I was
surprised that the people there were just

3
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:20,090
prepared to get their realization; and at
that time, you had this king ruling there.

4
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:27,000
We had a program in some hall and many people
got their realization.

5
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,759
And after that, all these problems came in
and I couldn’t keep contact with them at

6
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:41,899
all; but they must be somewhere, all of them
who got their realization at that time.

7
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:50,659
Also some people were cured with Sahaja Yoga.

8
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:58,159
Now the time has come for us to be awakened.

9
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:05,289
All these problems of fundamentalism, which
have not only troubled you – they have fundamentalism

10
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:13,470
everywhere, the whole world – there are
Christians who are fundamentalists, there

11
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,750
are Jews who are fundamentalists, all kinds
of things they are doing.

12
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:31,019
As you have seen that, how so many Muslims
were killed in Yugoslavia, and now many Muslims

13
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:32,550
are killing.

14
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:39,329
It’s going on between this and that area.

15
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:44,909
Nobody has business to kill anyone, but it
is happening.

16
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:51,940
The reason is that it has gone into their
heads that they are perfect, they have got

17
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,940
everything.

18
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,799
This is the worst thing that has happened
in the name of God.

19
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:08,790
God can never make some people available to
religion and others not.

20
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:20,409
These are all great saints, seers, prophets,
incarnations, born on the same tree of life.

21
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:28,580
Only people pluck those flowers, and they
are fighting with these dead flowers.

22
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,750
Everybody is in danger of this.

23
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,750
Everybody.

24
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:44,930
Now these Shias who are in Iraq are in danger;
they are hounded out by this Saddam Hussein.

25
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,670
For no reason.

26
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:58,519
Kurds are in another trouble; it is impossible
to understand that they never see that they

27
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:03,400
are doing such horrible things in the name
of God.

28
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,200
So, awakening is needed.

29
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,969
Unless and until you are awakened, you never
understand it.

30
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:19,070
Now there’s a Sahaja Yogi who is a Muslim,
and his wife is a French lady.

31
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:25,090
They have written a very nice book explaining
Koran very clearly.

32
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:40,509
We had about 62 people from different countries,
like Algeria, all these other countries around

33
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:51,720
Mediterranean Sea, African countries – Senegal
– who were communists, and they think now

34
00:04:51,720 --> 00:05:01,520
they have lost their faith in communism, so
maybe the people might fall into fundamentalism,

35
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,060
and they are very much worried about it.

36
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:12,750
So they are all coming to India for about
five days, they are going to have a proper

37
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,560
understanding of Sahaja Yoga.

38
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:21,760
Sahaja Yoga is the culmination of all the
religions.

39
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,060
As Mohammed Sahab has said, “You have to
be a wali."

40
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:31,360
He has talked about resurrection, Kiyama,
a complete chapter is there.

41
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,380
But they don’t want to talk about it.

42
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:41,229
And the shariat that they are using is actually
from the five angels from the five books.

43
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:48,740
The third book of Jeremiah, where in English
they call it Jeremiah, where Moses is the

44
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:56,919
one who talked of this shariat because when
He came from the mountain of Toor he found

45
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:06,520
the people were absolutely getting into complete
decadence conditions, absolutely.

46
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,940
All kinds of horrible things they were doing.

47
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,060
He got a fright.

48
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:16,210
He said, “How can I tell them about these
Ten Commandments; they will never listen to

49
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:20,360
Me, they have gone beyond any redemption."

50
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,699
So then, because they were so badly o , He
made these rules of shariat.

51
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:31,590
For the Jews, not for the Muslims.

52
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,789
That time there were no Muslims.

53
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:41,849
But the Muslims took all these five angels
as a part of their religion.

54
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:49,600
Out of that, they picked up this and they
started using this shariat.

55
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,060
Shariat is not in Koran.

56
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,569
Mohammed Sahab did not take a note of it,
I think.

57
00:06:55,569 --> 00:07:03,720
Shariat is in this another five books of the
Old Testament.

58
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:12,310
So this was taken over so much by the Muslims
because other religions are more money-oriented.

59
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,940
Christian religion is more money-oriented.

60
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,639
They want to make money in the name of God.

61
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,240
But Muslims thought better to take to power.

62
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,560
So they made it power-oriented.

63
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,009
To make it power-oriented, they had to suppress
the people, they had to tell them that, “You

64
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:33,360
can’t do this, you can’t do that, this
is not proper, that is not proper, otherwise

65
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:41,229
if you do like this, we’ll cut your throat
or your hands will be cut."

66
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:45,130
And they do all these things, no doubt, because
I’ve been to Iraq.

67
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:54,449
On every Friday people are buried alive in
the hot sand.

68
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:59,900
Only their heads are kept out, and so may
people go to watch it.

69
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,250
They really enjoy watching them.

70
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,690
So horrible it is.

71
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:11,139
They are just burning inside, the hot sand
is burning them, they can’t get out, and

72
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:16,050
only you can see their faces and then they
ultimately die.

73
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:22,250
This kind of cruelty, how can’t be possible
for God to do, because He is Rahimmath, He

74
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:27,300
is Rahim.

75
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:34,219
And it is even worse than gas chamber I can
tell you, because you see in front of you

76
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:37,419
somebody dying like that.

77
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:43,240
But when they are there, they don’t drink,
they don’t smoke.

78
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,360
They do it; secretly they do.

79
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,970
Once I was traveling from Riyadh to London
and I slept o .

80
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,670
When I opened My eyes they were all in burka.

81
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,840
They had come in burka, they had covered themselves
up and everything.

82
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:04,690
When I got up I saw very fashionable ladies,
very fashionable.

83
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,550
I thought we stopped somewhere, or what.

84
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:11,459
So I asked the air hostess, “Did we stop
somewhere?”

85
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:14,170
Said, “No, it’s a direct fight."

86
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,920
I said, “How these ladies, how have they
come in?”

87
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,110
They said, “They are the same.

88
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,700
You see they are wearing the burka and all
that."

89
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:28,440
Now see, this is what, they were painting
themselves, they were all doing everything.

90
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,310
So this is unnatural.

91
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,630
Mohammed Sahab was a very practical man.

92
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:37,060
He would never have said something unnatural.

93
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,890
Is very unnatural.

94
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:42,740
Of course, he asked the women to cover themselves
up.

95
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:46,710
Also one of the reasons is that the place
is full of dust.

96
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:50,649
Even the men cover their heads bound like
that.

97
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:52,240
So full of dust.

98
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,930
And He respected women so much.

99
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:07,810
He thought that the women should not be abused
as prostitutes, so He said whatever it is

100
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,769
because there were very few men, very few.

101
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:13,300
Most of the young men had died.

102
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,300
And so many women.

103
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,650
He said, “You marry five times will be alright,
but marry.

104
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:23,579
Don’t have women who are like prostitutes."

105
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:29,120
So, to give importance to marriage, He married
himself.

106
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,800
And He made others also marry.

107
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,529
But it’s not compulsory that you should
marry.

108
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:38,430
Under those circumstances –in Sanskrit we
call it samayachar, the time, that was the

109
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:44,700
time – and according to the time, these
people found out things, what is to be done

110
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,620
for that particular time.

111
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,720
Now for example, now we have drugs.

112
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,860
They didn’t have drugs at that time.

113
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,709
Even Mohammed Sahab time, there was no smoking.

114
00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:04,310
He, of course, He knew about the alcohol,
so He said no more alcohol.

115
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:09,950
But there was no smoking, so Muslims think
that if you smoke, it’s alright because

116
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,080
it’s allowed.

117
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,600
It’s an escape, you know, just an escape.

118
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,760
Now the drugs also, I was surprised in these
Arabic countries they’re taking drugs.

119
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,529
Young people are taking drugs.

120
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:25,630
Quite a lot.

121
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,290
Even ladies take drugs there.

122
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,269
It’s very surprising.

123
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:35,850
The reason for that is again, that in the
Koran there’s no word of drugs.

124
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,920
Now Koran itself was not written at the time
of Mohammed Sahab as you know very well.

125
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:46,690
There’s a very great scholar who has written
about it, that Mohammed Sahab got all these

126
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:52,269
inspirations, and He told people to write
who were of His age group, his friends and

127
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:54,240
things, very reliable people.

128
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,870
But they couldn’t write anything.

129
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,490
So they remembered everything by heart.

130
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,380
Forty years, they didn’t write.

131
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:06,180
Then they were getting old, so they asked
their children to learn how to write, and

132
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,769
they told the children.

133
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:14,070
So now from Mohammed Sahab to these people,
which was kept in their memory, then it was

134
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:17,010
even to the children.

135
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:24,010
So you can imagine there is authenticity of
Koran could be also little bit doubted, because

136
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,579
maybe there are certain things that have gone
wrong.

137
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:32,839
I tell you, the biggest mistake was this,
that it was said that Mohammed Sahab said

138
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:34,970
that I am the last prophet.

139
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,070
He never said that.

140
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:43,200
If He had said it, why should He talk about
Kiyama?

141
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,300
About the future?

142
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,420
If He was the last, He should have done with
the Kiyama part, why did He keep it hanging

143
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,750
in the air?

144
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,110
That shows He never said it.

145
00:12:54,110 --> 00:13:01,410
But apart from that, their word is that He
was the seal.

146
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:04,040
It means also stamp.

147
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,100
Even in Arabic language it means stamp.

148
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,050
So He is one of the stamps.

149
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:17,590
Like in the Indian scriptures, we have the
Primordial Master.

150
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:27,430
Then we have this Master incarnates, like
in Iran, you had Zoroaster.

151
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:31,540
According to Sahaja Yog, Zoroaster was the
same.

152
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:39,399
Five Zoroasters came there to preach about
God and religion.

153
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:45,070
These were the people who are now in India,
who ran away from there, we call them Iranians,

154
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,070
you see.

155
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,070
They ran away.

156
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:57,420
This is Persepolis, you know that where Shiraz,
near Shiraz, where the capital was there,

157
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,000
at that time.

158
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:10,920
Now all that was over and then they didn’t
want to say that Mohammed Sahab was one of

159
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,540
the incarnations of the Primordial Master.

160
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,920
They wouldn’t say that.

161
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:21,880
What they said, that He was the last.

162
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:27,800
Now logically we must understand, if He was
the last, then why did He talk about resurrection?

163
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:34,149
About the future?

164
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:38,730
Also He showed tremendous respect for Christ
and His Mother.

165
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,649
Even in the Bible there is no respect at all.

166
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:42,960
She is called as a ’woman’ in the Bible.

167
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,720
But He said that nobody dare say anything
against Her character.

168
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,100
Because He knew what She was.

169
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,639
Many things could not be explained that time.

170
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:59,802
Also all the time the war was going on, you
know that, and there were tribes who were

171
00:14:59,802 --> 00:15:04,959
attacking them; He had to go from here to
there and they were all destroyed.

172
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,009
Quite a lot of people were destroyed there.

173
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:17,750
So many people were destroyed in these wars
and in these big invasions of the other people.

174
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,730
Even Mohammed Sahab was given poison.

175
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,470
All the time people were after His life.

176
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,430
And in that whatever was possible, He has
explained it, whatever was possible in that

177
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,430
short time.

178
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,660
Beautiful things.

179
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:34,140
I mean Islam is one of the highest things
you can think of.

180
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:38,220
But, Muslims are nowhere near Islam.

181
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,829
Muslims are here, Islam is there.

182
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:43,130
Like in any religion.

183
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,850
I will tell you about Christianity.

184
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:51,769
Christianity, when Christ died, this fellow
Mr.

185
00:15:51,769 --> 00:16:05,199
Paul, who was a Roman executive, or bureaucrat,
working with the government.

186
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:14,980
So, he thought that all the blame of the death
of Christ will fall upon the Roman government.

187
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:19,990
So first thing He said, that Christ was killed
by Jews, so condemn them.

188
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:26,940
Poor things, for years together, these Jews
were condemned, and every action has a reaction:

189
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:33,320
because they were condemned, so now they have
become aggressive.

190
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:38,720
Then this Paul thought that this is a very
good platform, he can jump on it.

191
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:47,310
And he found this fellow whose name was Peter,
who was the weakest disciple of Christ.

192
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:54,680
Christ had said that the Satan will take you
over.

193
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,680
Had said it.

194
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,149
In the Bible it is.

195
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:03,490
So he got hold of this fellow, Peter, and
both have joined hands, and they re-edited

196
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,490
Bible.

197
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:09,661
Despite that there are lots of truths there
left, but they re-edited, and in that, He

198
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:19,430
said that Christ said that Peter will establish
a church, and I give him the key.

199
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,430
It’s impossible.

200
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,290
See now, we have so many Sahaja Yogis.

201
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:29,740
Among them, the one who is the weakest, good
for nothing, for whom I say that Satan will

202
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:34,460
take over, do you think he will be appointed
as the head?

203
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,460
Not possible!

204
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:40,860
That’s how this horrible Roman Catholic
church started.

205
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:50,080
Now the less said the better about Roman Catholic.

206
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,320
They are, firstly, very money-oriented people.

207
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,730
So many things are coming out about them that’s
shocking.

208
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:04,100
Very licentious, horrible people; they have
been abusing children, their priests have

209
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:14,720
been doing all kinds of things, and their
church itself has counterfeited ten million

210
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,290
dollars.

211
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,850
Counterfeited.

212
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,290
And distributed this through their bank.

213
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:25,350
Why should any divine person think of having
a bank?

214
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:28,160
They have a bank of their own.

215
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,160
Can you imagine?

216
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,050
And in the bank they use the counterfeited
money.

217
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:36,180
And that counterfeited money is distributed.

218
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:45,180
I have now, recently, living in Italy, so
many things are coming out about this church.

219
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:51,680
Now the latest is that this Pope has taken
five hundred thousand pounds as a kickback

220
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,600
from one man.

221
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,430
This man was arrested.

222
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:59,790
And he said that, “This man has taken a
kickback from me, but I have been giving him

223
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:02,270
since long."

224
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:08,320
And now, it was also said that, I mean it’s
there, that he has a keep.

225
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:15,950
He had her there in Warsaw, and he has brought
her here.

226
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:21,910
And this book, there is one book, ‘In The
Name of God’ where this author, English

227
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:31,190
author, American, he’s American, he has
pointed out that this Pope murdered the previous

228
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,290
Pope.

229
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:38,480
He has been a politician, he has sent lots
of, of course it was in time also, lots of

230
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:46,140
bombs and things to Warsaw, to Poland, and
many people were killed.

231
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:56,520
I mean a divine person, why should any divine
person do all these things?

232
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,960
This shows that all these, even Hindus are
terrible people if you want to hear about

233
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,180
them also, it’s terrible.

234
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:10,250
I don’t know how they are Hindus, because
it’s written in the Gita, that in everybody’s

235
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,260
heart, there is the Spirit.

236
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,870
So how can you have caste system?

237
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:23,600
And his own book, that is Gita, was written
by an illegitimate child of a sherwoman.

238
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,380
So this caste system was created later on
by these so-called Brahmins who never knew

239
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,070
what is Brahma is.

240
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:36,080
Then Buddhists, another nonsense they are,
terrible.

241
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,170
Recently this Dalai Lama, he’s a beggar,
he’s begging everywhere money, you see,

242
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:48,000
he has got so many wrinkles that you can count
them.

243
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,591
He said, surprisingly, that we cannot have
one universal religion because we are all

244
00:20:54,591 --> 00:20:55,591
different people.

245
00:20:55,591 --> 00:21:00,470
Because they want to fight.

246
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:03,940
Because if you are one religion, then who
will fight?

247
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,250
They want to fight and kill others.

248
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:12,830
So this great power of killing others will
be lost once you become one religion.

249
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,440
So he says, we don’t believe in universal
religion.

250
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,480
We are all different people.

251
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,980
How are we different?

252
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:29,559
See, if you cut your hand, the same bone,
the same nerves, the same arteries, veins,

253
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:34,000
everything in everyone, whether you are Irani,
India, English, America.

254
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:43,850
There is no difference at all, it is skin
deep, absolutely skin deep.

255
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,220
What is the difference?

256
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:50,550
We laugh the same way, we cry the same way.

257
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:53,990
We don’t cry from our ears.

258
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,600
We cry from our eyes only.

259
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,350
All of us.

260
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,150
What is the difference is?

261
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:06,000
All our hair, you see, grow out of our head.

262
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,460
They don’t grow through our nose or something
like that.

263
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:14,700
It’s a funny thing, you know, that “we
are different."

264
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,160
We are not.

265
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,390
I mean it’s surprising.

266
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:24,180
How can they say such a thing about God that
He created us different?

267
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,660
Of course, there’s a skin difference.

268
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:32,040
It is, after all, supposing you wear all just
the same.

269
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,530
It would have been so boring.

270
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:41,050
Everybody looks the same like a laboratory,
you see, there’s no expression of anything,

271
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:50,350
the same nose, the same eyes, and you wouldn’t
be able to make out who is who.

272
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:57,300
So the variety was created, the variety was
created, just to create beauty.

273
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,010
Is important that there should be variety.

274
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:05,370
Whatever God has done for our good, we always
make a mess out of it.

275
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,860
That’s specialty of human beings.

276
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,910
Whatever good things He creates or does that,
we can easily make a mess out of it.

277
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:16,980
So it’s important we all should get our
realization first.

278
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,230
We all have to become the ‘wali.’

279
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:23,180
Wali you have to be.

280
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:28,060
And once that happens, then you will be surprised,
you will know Mohammed Sahab much better,

281
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:36,600
you know Islam much better, and you know all
the religions, that are contained together.

282
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,010
So many things happen now.

283
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:42,240
Tomorrow’s lecture I am going to tell you
all about it, what great things are going

284
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:50,800
to come once we all become one with this Ruh,
with all this All-pervading.

285
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,910
They have talked about Ruh.

286
00:23:53,910 --> 00:24:00,980
But Islam is only nothing but Ruh, while the
Muslims [are] least bothered.

287
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,750
Where is the Ruh?

288
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,830
They never find out.

289
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:07,490
Only thing they know is to kill somebody,
or to … this thing.

290
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:13,380
Really, it is impossible to understand this
fighting business – is so much.

291
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,930
Go on fighting.

292
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:24,370
They are, actually I should say, little naive,
so their fundamentalism is open.

293
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,080
Christians are no less fundamentalists.

294
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,010
Tremendous fundamentalists they are.

295
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:36,470
In England, there’s only one religion, is
this Church of England.

296
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:42,500
Other religions are not religions at all,
only Church of England.

297
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,670
Great fundamentalists.

298
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,840
Apart from Catholic Church.

299
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,300
Now, how far they are going, they are very
liberal.

300
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:55,100
First they said, some of them said, that Christ
was a homosexual.

301
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:59,630
Can you imagine such a thing to be said?

302
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:00,630
Alright.

303
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:05,590
So now they are having homosexual marriages.

304
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:11,540
In the Church.

305
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:16,380
This is the situation of all the religions
today.

306
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:23,080
All kinds of stupid things they are doing
in the name of God.

307
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:30,430
How can in the church you marry such things,
and then you can adopt a child and do like

308
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,430
that?

309
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,550
Because, reason is, they want money.

310
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:43,470
So, now, if you want to have money, you have
to, it’s like an election, you, like the

311
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,470
votes.

312
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:48,561
So far, these votes, you have to accept whatever
they say.

313
00:25:48,561 --> 00:25:55,290
There are no fundamental principles, there
is no fundamental value system.

314
00:25:55,290 --> 00:26:01,430
Whatever people say, “Alright, we’ll do
that."

315
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:05,280
This is how the religion has been to this
time.

316
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:09,540
And I don’t know how many more stupid things
they are going to do, and how many people

317
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,410
they are going to kill in the name of God.

318
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:14,600
All of them think that God is in their pocket.

319
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:19,390
Whether you are Christian, Hindu, Muslim,
anything.

320
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:21,770
One can commit any sin.

321
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:24,310
There’s no restriction.

322
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:28,550
But a Sahaja Yogi cannot.

323
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:33,180
Sahaja Yogi has to practice what he preaches.

324
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:39,510
If he doesn’t do it, he gets out of Sahaja
Yoga.

325
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,070
But he does it.

326
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:45,710
I don’t have to say, “These are Ten Commandments,”
nothing.

327
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:52,640
You get the light of your spirit, and you
yourself look after yourself, I don’t have

328
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,640
to bother.

329
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,120
You become your own masters, your prophets,
and you look after yourself.

330
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,510
I don’t have to bother about it.

331
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:04,900
It is as simple as that.

332
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:11,950
And nowhere, in all these religions, there
is even an essence of love that is God.

333
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:16,180
Whether it is this or that.

334
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:22,150
They are all full of greed and lust.

335
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,150
Absolutely.

336
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:29,580
Sometimes I feel at the helm of a airs, we
have people who are much worse than us.

337
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,720
Much worse than even ordinary people.

338
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,300
They do all kinds of nonsensical things.

339
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:38,160
In Riyadh, you have todo five times namaz.

340
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:49,140
These mutawahs, they are standing with hunters,
you see, they close all the shops, five times.

341
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:59,290
Now, if any lady is there or somebody, if
she doesn’t cover her head fully, they’ll

342
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:03,410
come and hit you.

343
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:07,720
They may not be Muslims, but you are supposed
to cover your head.

344
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:13,320
Such injustice, and no freedom of any kind.

345
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:18,520
While the prince and princess with their horrible
life they are leading, horrible.

346
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:26,301
And the other people also, the sheiks, are
… you know what kind of people they are.

347
00:28:26,301 --> 00:28:29,000
They have no right to call themselves Islamic.

348
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,920
No right.

349
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,799
No character, nothing.

350
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,460
Horrible people.

351
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:42,740
So now, we have to understand now that all
of us should take to something that is reality,

352
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:47,000
and must awaken ourselves to that reality,
to enjoy life.

353
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,690
Now time has come for you to enjoy.

354
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:52,200
We have had enough of this nonsense.

355
00:28:52,200 --> 00:29:01,200
Now we can stop it and finish it o .
Doctor must have told you how physical, emotional,

356
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,300
mental problems can be solved so easily with
this.

357
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:11,190
Also material problems can be solved.

358
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:19,160
All of you understand the importance of your
own personalities, because you are Iranians

359
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,630
here.

360
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:28,450
If you want to save your people, you have
to work it out yourself.

361
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:32,540
We have already some Iranians who are Sahaja
Yogis.

362
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,660
I don’t know if you have met them.

363
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:43,710
There are some Sahaja Yogis already – Iranians
– they come to Turkey and go back.

364
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:51,500
We are going to have a Diwali Pūjā in Turkey,
where all these Eastern Block and Russians

365
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:55,850
are going to come, and all these Muslims might
come also.

366
00:29:55,850 --> 00:30:04,230
They have given us a very nice place also,
might have that there.

367
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:09,290
Will be a good idea to meet all of the people
who are enlightened.

368
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:15,700
One good thing about Russians and these Communist
countries is that their government may be

369
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,850
bad, but you see, they are very open-hearted.

370
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:25,570
I mean they are so sensitive to spirituality.

371
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:32,540
In one place called Togliatti, there are 22,000
Sahaja Yogis practicing.

372
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,920
Just like that.

373
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,000
Spreading so fast.

374
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,140
They are so open-minded.

375
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:45,860
They are so susceptible, they are so sensitive.

376
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:51,210
Just seeing My photograph, can you imagine,
thousands of them came.

377
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,210
I said how?

378
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:57,140
They said it is, you can see Mother.

379
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:01,410
And all these people, Rajneesh, they just
threw them out.

380
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:02,870
Except for these Azerbaijanis.

381
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:06,630
Poor things, they smuggle Koran there.

382
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:10,110
And this is, Americans are doing this trick.

383
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:14,740
You see, Americans are very clever, they want
to create problems.

384
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:20,450
So they gave them these Korans, and they were
smuggling.

385
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:24,940
Saddam Hussein they are trying to reclaim
somehow or other.

386
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:30,340
They could have arrested him long time back.

387
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,620
But he’s still there.

388
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:35,140
What are they up to, these Americans?

389
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:40,920
They themselves gave him so many ships and
things, and later on they are bombarding their

390
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,920
own ships.

391
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:51,590
The Germans built his bunk, and they said
this bunk, you cannot destroy because we have

392
00:31:51,590 --> 00:32:00,770
built it, we know what it is.

393
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:04,030
So all the European countries have this Mr.

394
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:06,350
Saddam Hussein, and now he is on their back.

395
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:14,450
So, it’s a big game of politics – nonsense
that’s going on.

396
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:21,370
All these things will soon be disappearing
because people know now.

397
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,680
Everybody’s getting exposed.

398
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:29,370
And I’m sure some sensible people will stand
up and say that stop all this nonsense now,

399
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:32,120
let’s stick to reality.

400
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:38,420
If you have any questions, I would like to
answer you also.

401
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:42,480
Man spoke.

402
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:58,590
Was worried that 
the situation in Iran is affecting the people’s

403
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,590
spirituality.

404
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:04,730
They no longer believe in Koran.

405
00:33:04,730 --> 00:34:00,680
A woman he knows whose children and grandchildren
were killed has stopped praying altogether.

406
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,600
Actually you must get your connection.

407
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,930
You should get connected to God Almighty.

408
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:09,419
Then there’s no need even to pray, just
you desire, it works out.

409
00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:18,330
I want you Iranians to really get in connection
with God Almighty, and all your desires will

410
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:19,330
be fulfilled.

411
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:21,200
But first the connection must be there.

412
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:33,170
Without the connection, if you are praying,
what’s the use?

413
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:37,940
Many people in Iran also think the same way
as you are saying, very much.

414
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:59,950
But they are little helpless because they
are not free, you see.

415
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:14,240
I have this great feeling for Iran.

416
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,210
Fatima was there.

417
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:20,760
Her two children were killed there.

418
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,960
That’s a very sad story.

419
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:35,880
And now, despite all oil and everything, I
have heard that people are getting very poor

420
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:42,390
there, and even small children of 12 years
or so are carrying guns in their hands.

421
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:46,210
It’s a mad world.

422
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:51,640
We have a company of shipping, Indo–Iran.

423
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:56,200
And the officers who go there and come tell
us the story about it.

424
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:02,910
Already there is one doctor who has married
an Indian girl who is a Sahaja Yogi.

425
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,400
But they are all afraid to talk about Sahaja
Yoga.

426
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:10,100
Because, you see, it’s a military rule there.

427
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,840
You cannot say anything.

428
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,970
But there are.

429
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:21,150
But outside Iran, you can work it out.

430
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:29,570
It’s a very silent revolution that’s going
on in the whole world.

431
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:34,170
Now in Sahaja Yoga there are fifty-five countries.

432
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:39,119
Fifty-five countries.

433
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,100
And they all love each other.

434
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:50,050
Never a problem of any quarreling, fighting,
nothing.

435
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:55,370
Tremendous love.

436
00:36:55,370 --> 00:37:03,360
So all this racialism, all these artificial
barriers which separates human beings, is

437
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:09,380
absolutely finished, and you will be amazed
that you have friends everywhere.

438
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:17,190
We have one Iranian girl who came from Iran
to Rome.

439
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:19,460
She went to the ashram.

440
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:22,460
Immediately they said, “Yes, yes, come along."

441
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:25,370
She’s staying there.

442
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,530
And then she met Me.

443
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:32,090
Because she had her realization in, I think,
in Turkey.

444
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:37,170
Then she went back, then she came, and she
came to this ashram.

445
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:41,150
She is very nicely settled there.

446
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:49,660
So, all over the world, people are there,
your brothers and sisters will be very happy

447
00:37:49,660 --> 00:38:00,870
to help you in every way that is possible.

448
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:23,960
It is not for any money, for any favor, anything,
but it is for love.

449
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,980
Any other question?

450
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:31,980
They have all got realization!

451
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:38,640
Your namaz is nothing but realization, that’s
what it is.

452
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,350
Islam means surrender.

453
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:45,270
Islam itself means surrender.

454
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:53,500
And the whole namaz is nothing but awakening
of the Kundalini.

455
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:58,580
But they don’t understand.

456
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:03,560
Like a physical exercise they do namaz.

457
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,070
Nothing goes in the heart.

458
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:11,820
The religion is not inside.

459
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:17,720
It’s all outside.

460
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,230
Without love, what is religion?

461
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,600
Because God is love.

462
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,950
He is truth.

463
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:50,430
But truth

464
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,450
is love.

465
00:39:52,450 --> 00:40:00,290
Everywhere we are getting one or two Iranians
coming to the program.

466
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:01,350
Everywhere.

467
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:04,170
But in Turkey we had many.

468
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:09,600
They come to Turkey – they’re allowed
– I think, to come for holidays or something.

469
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,500
So we had many there and now they have gone
back.

470
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:27,370
And secretly they are spreading Sahaja Yoga
there, giving realizations to people.

471
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:32,810
Also in ancient times, the son of Rama went
through Iran.

472
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:34,790
His name was Luv.

473
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:37,420
He went to Caucasus.

474
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:40,860
That’s why the Russians are called as Slavs.

475
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:45,440
You see, his name was Luv – slav – with
love.

476
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:53,750
Now this is said in our Puranas, that when
He went there, there was a temple of a Goddess

477
00:40:53,750 --> 00:41:02,100
called Hindulika, on the way, in Iran itself,
there was this temple but I don’t know the

478
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:10,190
exact spot where it is, and they used to worship
the goddess in those days.

479
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:19,410
But then the whole thing was very different.

480
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:43,210
They used to worship women, mothers, very
much in those days.

481
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:47,410
Question: Is there a center in Israel?

482
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:52,080
Shri Mataji: We have a center in Israel.

483
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,930
There is a center in Israel.

484
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:58,870
There are 20 people who are Sahaja Yogis.

485
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:06,630
What happened, from Russia, those Jews who
went there, they started a center.

486
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:18,060
Lady: [worried about the problems in that
region affecting people, in the same way as

487
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,580
in Iran.]

488
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:26,760
Shri Mataji: They have gone o their heads,
I think.

489
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:34,100
They have suffered so much, and that reaction
is there.

490
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:37,170
And so many bad things they are doing, you
see.

491
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:44,430
So what happens, always anger always begets
anger.

492
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:50,420
They got it from Hitler, so now they are giving
it back.

493
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:52,530
Horrible things are happening there.

494
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:58,520
But gradually I’m sure the election was
good they said, the Premier is a good person.

495
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,710
But it’s wrong.

496
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:11,460
It’s wrong to behave like that.

497
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:16,910
They also suffered a lot.

498
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:19,660
All the sufferings are now coming out.

499
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:27,360
It’s all human creation, this kind of hatred.

500
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:32,640
First of all, that they killed Christ, so
they were treated as something very low.

501
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,619
Also they were regarded as a low race.

502
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:41,170
They suffered a lot.

503
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:45,480
This Freud, he was a Jew.

504
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:52,811
And what he did, that he thought that in Christian
religion, there is this original sin, so he

505
00:43:52,811 --> 00:43:55,230
started his own theory.

506
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:59,700
So many jumped on him and they started worshipping
him.

507
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:04,360
Of all kinds of things, it is very difficult.

508
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:10,680
But do you know that the Jews ultimately lost
everything.

509
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:14,730
They came to India and settled in Kashmir.

510
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:17,520
And they are even now called as Kashman Jew.

511
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:25,120
Their surnames are ‘Jew.’

512
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:30,190
And also Moses died in India.

513
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:59,950
He died in India.

514
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:57,350
So I’ll take your leave now.

515
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:00,050
May God bless you.

516
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:01,380
Very nice to have met you.

517
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,310
Now I can see great hope for Iran.

518
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:05,539
Very great hope.
