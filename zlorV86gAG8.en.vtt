00:00:09.203 --> 00:00:18.114
The lotus of your Sahasrara is open now.

00:00:19.684 --> 00:00:25.943
It must open more and more and more

00:00:26.144 --> 00:00:28.854
and should not suddenly collapse,

00:00:28.884 --> 00:00:32.894
again open, again collapse.

00:00:37.016 --> 00:00:42.516
It's a very complicated phenomena you can see in the West

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:45.948
and you can be very much surprised sometimes.

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.384
To Me it's sometimes very shocking to see.

00:00:49.585 --> 00:00:53.297
Suddenly someone will come, "Oh, I'm very nervous about this thing.

00:00:53.498 --> 00:00:55.451
I'm very nervous about that."

00:00:55.532 --> 00:00:57.252
Another person will come and tell Me,

00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:02.476
"I want to leave Sahaja Yoga now." Another one comes and tells me,

00:01:02.677 --> 00:01:08.434
"Oh, it's too much, I cannot go any further with it."

00:01:14.216 --> 00:01:20.020
So we must realize that there is something very peculiar

00:01:20.221 --> 00:01:22.568
within us,

00:01:22.769 --> 00:01:26.979
something absurd within us. That's why it happens.

00:01:27.188 --> 00:01:30.259
We go forward, backwards, forward, backwards all the time.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.530
What is this pendulum?

00:01:34.775 --> 00:01:39.688
That cannot be Sahasrara. Sahasrara is not a pendulum,

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:42.548
it is a lotus.

00:01:46.586 --> 00:01:51.142
So the pendulum is the chitta, is the attention;

00:01:51.343 --> 00:01:54.225
the attention that moves from left to right,

00:01:54.426 --> 00:01:59.762
right to left, goes on
like that all the time.

00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:11.982
But the area of Sahasrara is the realm of God.

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:21.049
When the Brahmarandra opens fully,

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.375
then the heavens open within yourself.

00:02:29.654 --> 00:02:38.207
The Kundalini, which has risen up and given you Realization,

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:42.020
creates that subtle opening, by which

00:02:42.221 --> 00:02:46.142
the Divine starts pouring all its
subtleties inside

00:02:46.343 --> 00:02:49.080
your brain.

00:02:51.026 --> 00:02:55.026
But if you are pressing it from both the sides with these balloons,

00:02:55.227 --> 00:02:58.595
sometimes opening, sometimes closing, sometimes opening,

00:02:58.796 --> 00:03:03.118
the Divine recedes Its attention. You must know that.

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.202
The attention is receded back and if it is done many a times,

00:03:07.403 --> 00:03:11.270
the Divine doesn't bother.

00:03:16.418 --> 00:03:20.691
So it is you who has to achieve that state

00:03:20.892 --> 00:03:26.360
and all of us can achieve that state of Nirvikalpa.

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.621
In that there is just progression.

00:03:33.822 --> 00:03:37.560
After Nirvikalpa you cannot come down.

00:03:37.761 --> 00:03:40.175
If somebody is still

00:03:40.376 --> 00:03:42.105
going up and down, up and down,

00:03:42.306 --> 00:03:48.501
he should know he is still not up to the point

00:03:48.702 --> 00:03:52.292
and he should face up to himself

00:03:52.493 --> 00:03:56.673
and tell himself or herself that

00:03:56.874 --> 00:04:03.369
"No, I have to be into Nirvikalpa,

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.288
where I do not come down."

00:04:08.781 --> 00:04:12.808
The people who are not in the Nirvikalpa state

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:19.188
are not going to be saved. I am very sorry to say that.

00:04:25.756 --> 00:04:30.677
They are not going to be saved.

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:35.099
They will be punished.

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:40.865
May not be in the same way those who are not Realized souls,

00:04:41.066 --> 00:04:45.714
but they will not occupy

00:04:45.915 --> 00:04:50.407
the seats in the realm of God Almighty.

00:04:51.466 --> 00:04:56.911
At least you must reach the state of Nirvikalpa.

00:04:59.547 --> 00:05:03.558
Do not blame any circumstance.

00:05:03.871 --> 00:05:09.738
Do not blame your father, mother, brother, atmosphere, this, that.

00:05:09.953 --> 00:05:13.953
There's no need to blame anyone.

00:05:16.837 --> 00:05:19.888
“Because somebody came, we were influenced.”

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:22.221
What is the matter with you?

00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:25.630
I am here, you are not influenced by Me.

00:05:25.831 --> 00:05:30.049
How are you influenced by somebody who is so stupid, obviously,

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.335
so dominating?

00:05:37.227 --> 00:05:41.484
That means - what is your level?

00:05:43.814 --> 00:05:47.693
So tomorrow I've decided to tell you

00:05:47.774 --> 00:05:52.334
how to be at the state of Nirvikalpa.

00:05:55.774 --> 00:06:00.854
As I said, we can approach mentally;

00:06:01.094 --> 00:06:03.534
but mentally if I say you take this medicine

00:06:03.734 --> 00:06:07.174
and you do not take the medicine, then it’s just a mental thing.

00:06:07.374 --> 00:06:10.734
The medicine is kept on the cupboard, you are just the same.

00:06:10.934 --> 00:06:15.254
And then you'll say, "Mother, yes we listened to your lecture."

00:06:17.534 --> 00:06:21.934
So the key note

00:06:22.134 --> 00:06:28.374
of tomorrow's puja, as I've decided,

00:06:28.574 --> 00:06:34.974
that you have to be at the Nirvikalpa state.

00:06:43.694 --> 00:06:53.214
You can say this Sahasrara Day is a very big day

00:06:53.414 --> 00:06:57.814
because I never threw such an ultimatum before.

00:06:58.134 --> 00:07:02.974
Because now we are established

00:07:03.174 --> 00:07:07.414
as Vishwa Dharma,

00:07:07.614 --> 00:07:11.534
as the Universal Religion.

00:07:12.494 --> 00:07:17.254
We are not like other religions

00:07:17.454 --> 00:07:23.614
where, after the death of the incarnations,
people started the religion

00:07:23.814 --> 00:07:28.534
and did whatever they wanted to do with that.

00:07:29.814 --> 00:07:37.134
In our living time

00:07:37.334 --> 00:07:44.014
we are going to make ourselves that instrument

00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:48.914
which will represent the Vishwa Dharma.
