1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,320
Today, I have taken up the subject of Left Vishuddhi

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,440
because I felt that I must one day speak on this subject.

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:22,360
That this is absolutely not intelligible to God that you are guilty.

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,920
For what?

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,720
Guilty for what are you?

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,360
If you ask yourself you will say, “Oh, we are
guilty because we crucified Christ.” – at the most.

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,800
That is the maximum guilt a human being
can say on his head. “We crucified Christ.”

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,560
“We tortured all the saints.” All right.

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,760
But by being guilty what do you get?

10
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,080
Do you get Him back? Can you go back
and correct that situation? You cannot.

11
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,360
But harping upon that, you do get into your sub-conscious mind.

12
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:10,280
You get into a position where you are
no more normal to receive the love of God.

13
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,320
You recede into a corner of your mind which is darkness,

14
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,520
which is ignorance, which is blindness;

15
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:29,560
where you cannot receive that beautiful
ray, that eternal flow that’s coming in.

16
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:36,080
You hide yourself at the back and then you say, “What about the sun?

17
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:42,040
I cannot receive it because I don’t deserve it.”

18
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:51,640
Behind all this ego-orientation in the West though
I wish they were purely egoistical – they are not.

19
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:59,280
All this ego recedes back into that
little pouch, what we call ‘the guilt’.

20
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,120
You say something to someone.

21
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,800
It’s not saying that thing at that stage

22
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,920
that, “I’ve said it, all right I’ve said it
and I take the responsibility. It’s good.”

23
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:15,120
Not that way. But you come back
home, “Oh, I should not have said that!”

24
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,960
So you wobble between one kind of action into another kind,

25
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,560
from an aggressive to the another one of a receding type.

26
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,600
And this wobbling really is very, very troublesome.

27
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:40,520
It can go on too much, the oscillation could be
so much that it can make you absolutely frantic,

28
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:46,160
diffident and sometimes useless.

29
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:55,680
On the contrary, God wants to find
human beings who are cheerful people,

30
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,680
who are happy people, who are thankful to Him for His blessings.

31
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:09,920
The most unhappy animal in this world
is a human being. Can you believe that?

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,640
Animals don’t know happiness and unhappiness, also a good point is.

33
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,000
But the most unhappy human being and the most complicated human being

34
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,240
has become so over, you see, self-destructive

35
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,200
that a destruction force has built within himself.

36
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,040
Now think of that force that has built you up into a human:

37
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,360
how with care and love, without your knowledge, without troubling you.

38
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,880
Even when you were born you never knew what was the pain of the birth;

39
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,680
your mother took over it.

40
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:55,240
He’s made you a human being so
carefully, delicately he’s built you up.

41
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:02,680
For what? What is the fruit of this beautiful flower?

42
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:09,600
Why the flower starts hitting itself?
Have you ever heard of anyone like that?

43
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:17,320
This is the worst disease with which we, in the West, suffer.

44
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:23,800
French, yes, we had at least double the number
of people than we have here today, surprisingly,

45
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:30,920
but all of them had the same problem
and I think all their psychologists,

46
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:44,200
psychoanalysts, the books, the writers,
the philosophers, everyone has done to them;

47
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:50,000
they have given you the ideas and everybody accepts them

48
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,080
and they curse themselves morning till evening,

49
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,880
walking with so many wrinkles on the forehead.

50
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,480
When you ask them they will say, “Mother we are very unhappy people.”

51
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,560
It’s like asking unhappiness to come and decorate you.

52
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:19,520
But it has a subtler meaning, of which people are not aware.

53
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,400
These are the times when you have to get your Realisation,

54
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,240
this mass Realisation has to work out, is all prophesised,

55
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,800
and very important times are these.

56
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:40,840
All the stars are acting to help us.
The whole Universe is helping them.

57
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:47,400
All the elements are helping us. We are on the stage.

58
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,960
But when the actors arrive on the stage they are finished!

59
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,520
They can’t act, they can’t do anything, they can’t play their game.

60
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,640
They are so involved with their different roles.

61
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,440
And that is why one has to understand the subtler effect of it.

62
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,080
Then only you will get rid of this guilt.

63
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,280
You are playing into the hands of negative forces,

64
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:22,160
they are not less than any atomic bombs, built within yourself.

65
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,040
Now what is the way it works out, I think people do not realise it.

66
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:35,680
It’s a very subtle method. Let’s see the atomic
bomb, hydrogen bomb, what will you do there?

67
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:41,360
They will separate something which should not be separated.

68
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:48,520
We break atom which is not divisible into its divisible parts.

69
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:55,680
So we put a pressure to break them.

70
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,360
And when that breaking force, that aggression I would say,

71
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:09,120
is worked out, that becomes another destructive force.

72
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:17,920
So whatever effort we have put into
that multiplies; it’s not the same force.

73
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,880
And that we use for our destruction.

74
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:27,040
I mean, this, only human being can
do, to create things to destroy himself.

75
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,840
But this force which works within our
minds, within ourselves, within our being

76
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,680
– where we actually really hate ourselves, sometimes I feel,

77
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,240
the way we are destroying ourselves –

78
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:46,480
this force we build within ourselves thanks
to many nonsensical writers and conditioners,

79
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,160
and people who talk of conditioning really condition you much worse!

80
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,680
You should be singing and chirping like a bird.

81
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,200
You should be laughing and enjoying life like a flower.

82
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:05,840
But I find human beings faces, all, looking so very unhappy.

83
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,080
What’s the reason?

84
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:14,440
The reason is you are separated from your own being,

85
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,240
the being that integrates you. You are completely disintegrated.

86
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:29,720
When you disintegrate a hydrogen atom,
you form a very big force [that is] built into it.

87
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,720
In the same way, you are disintegrating your being:

88
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,560
your physical being on one side, your mental being on another side,

89
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,720
your spiritual being on another side.

90
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,440
There’s no integrating point.

91
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:51,720
And when you cannot feel that integration you feel guilty,

92
00:08:51,800 --> 00:09:00,560
but that guilt is just a symptom of a
very big destructive force built-in you.

93
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:07,520
This is the way we are going to destroy ourselves.

94
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,360
No other way.

95
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,720
Our destruction is not going to come to
us from outside, that can be controlled.

96
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,280
It’s going to come from within, within ourselves.

97
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:28,960
Everything we do now, after disintegration, is further disintegration

98
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:35,880
or further building up that negative force within ourselves.

99
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:46,000
But to integrate it, to make you feel
complete integration with all your being,

100
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:53,040
is only possible if you can somehow
or other get to that integrating force

101
00:09:53,120 --> 00:10:00,520
which is still there and is quite deep.

102
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,840
That’s the last chance I would say now. That has to win.

103
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,720
The way the negative forces have set in motion,

104
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,160
of which you may not be aware at all, you may not be aware,

105
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,880
you don’t know what darkness is there.

106
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:30,720
And to fight it, what one has to do is to
bring in that light of the Spirit which integrates.

107
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,960
Darkness always disintegrates you.

108
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,600
For example there is complete darkness all right,

109
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,680
I can’t feel you, I don’t know who you are,
where you are sitting, [then] we are all separated.

110
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,240
I can’t see you, I don’t know who you people are here.

111
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:51,560
I wouldn’t know where is the window, where is
the door. I’ll hold this and say, “This is the Truth.”

112
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,400
All disintegrated personality.

113
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,800
And disintegrated people always see
aberrations, they see different things,

114
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,520
different auras, different things.

115
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:11,560
So these forces are built within us, of negativity,

116
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:17,000
when we go to the extremes of negativity.

117
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:26,680
So, in the Kundalini shastra, we can say
that the left and right side, when used too much,

118
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:33,240
you build up these forces in the head of
eleven Rudras, of the eleven destructive forces.

119
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,320
A cancer patient develops it.

120
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,480
But even before developing cancer people can develop it.

121
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:47,200
And there are so many things that can create this

122
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,160
that sometimes one would feel, in this vicious circle,

123
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,720
that how are you going to patch up the whole society?

124
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:06,240
And there’s only one thing that will
save the situation – it’s Self-realisation.

125
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:13,120
All other things are destroying,

126
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,680
are absolutely confusing.

127
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,320
But there’s only one thing if you can do, it saves the whole thing.

128
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:25,760
Like putting on the light – finished!

129
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:31,040
But people don’t understand the importance of Self-realisation,

130
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,600
because some people ask me, “What’s the
use of getting the cool breeze in the hand?”

131
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,520
Now see the big canvas of the whole
thing, the whole cosmos, in a jeopardy.

132
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,840
See what’s happening to human beings today.

133
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,280
And if they are to be saved [there’s] no use being unhappy.

134
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,240
Like in France they said, “You cannot
Mother, say you are a very happy person.”

135
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:04,920
I said, “Why?” “Because that means you are ignorant of the shocks.”

136
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,280
You see? I have to say, “I am very unhappy,”
you see. I have to paint some lines here to show

137
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:16,760
that I’m very deeply concerned, worried about the whole world.

138
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:23,320
But what is the solution have you
got? You want me to be like you only?

139
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,800
Is that the solution?

140
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:33,040
That if ten people are weeping you also
join them weeping? Is that the solution?

141
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:40,520
And the one and only method that we have,

142
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:48,440
which has been already told and prescribed and has been prophesised,

143
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:53,680
nobody seeks it! No one seeks it!

144
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,400
What is the destination? And the destination is the Spirit.

145
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:06,520
And today, the background is so black and so dark

146
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:13,720
that this solution is the end of everything.

147
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,800
But do we realise this?

148
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,720
On the contrary the vicious circle builds in within us all the time.

149
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:29,600
“Oh, see how the world is miserable! How can I be happy?”

150
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,760
“I am so unhappy in life!”

151
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:40,800
I have yet to come across a person before
Realisation saying that, “I am a happy person.”

152
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,640
Maybe ego-oriented people might
say, “I am happy.” meaning, “My ego [is]”.

153
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,480
If he goes in a swanky car or something
like that he’s very happy, on top of the world!

154
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,720
After ten minutes you see him [looking miserable].

155
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:02,280
And this vicious circle is set in. This
ego-oriented circle, or another one, it sets in.

156
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,600
Another vicious circle and another
vicious circle and another vicious circle,

157
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,760
we go on from one to another,

158
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:19,400
moving on the wheels after wheels
without realising that, “Where we are going?”

159
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,280
And this vicious circle has to be broken

160
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:36,720
by one faith, by one understanding, that God is forgiveness,

161
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,680
God is love.

162
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:51,560
When we feel love for anyone without any
lust and greed, then that is God’s love within us.

163
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:58,880
That He is the embodiment of that pure love

164
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,520
which just loves,

165
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:10,160
which has given you this beautiful human
life and wants to make you more beautiful.

166
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:18,400
He created all this creation for you and that He
wants you to enjoy the bounties of this creation.

167
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,840
He wants you to enjoy the citizen of
his realm and the Kingdom of his Grace.
