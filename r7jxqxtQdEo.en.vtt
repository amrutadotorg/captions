WEBVTT

00:02.579 --> 00:06.596
Today we are here

00:10.775 --> 00:17.146
to celebrate Sahasrar Day.

00:27.048 --> 00:35.211
It was not very difficult for Me to open
the Sahasrar

00:35.412 --> 00:39.178
because there were so many seekers
in this world:

00:39.379 --> 00:49.361
because, of course, I had studied also
the permutations and combinations

00:49.562 --> 00:56.760
from which you all are, in a way,
suffering;

00:58.167 --> 01:02.753
also, the time had come.

01:02.959 --> 01:10.394
I felt [that] horrible gurus, who are
really devils,

01:10.595 --> 01:16.661
are trying to capture all the seekers.

01:16.862 --> 01:24.225
I thought it’s high time that Sahasrara
should be opened out.

01:33.168 --> 01:39.237
It was not like Christ’s crucifixion
by any chance.

01:39.438 --> 01:45.409
In those days one had to do lot of tapasya

01:45.610 --> 01:50.796
and that’s what He went through.

01:51.042 --> 01:57.681
But in these modern times, what you know

02:00.724 --> 02:06.468
is much more important than what you do.

02:07.542 --> 02:15.243
It is such a universal awareness now

02:15.444 --> 02:20.501
because of maybe, medias, because
of communications,

02:20.702 --> 02:28.718
because of travelling, that a human mind
knows a lot.

02:28.919 --> 02:34.934
It knows so much sometimes that its brain
cannot even bear it.

02:36.212 --> 02:39.904
It is so overloaded with ideas.

02:40.105 --> 02:46.588
And also the human mind is all the time
anxious

02:46.789 --> 02:54.602
to grasp, absorb and retain whatever
he thinks is knowledge.

02:54.803 --> 02:59.885
But he lacks discretion, so all kind
of things are accumulated

03:00.086 --> 03:03.016
in his brain in the modern times.

03:03.217 --> 03:16.665
Specially with the advent of all these
media like television, computers.

03:16.866 --> 03:23.097
Not a media, but it’s quite a complicated
brain again.

03:23.851 --> 03:28.396
The man had to know the technique of all
these things very much.

03:28.597 --> 03:36.878
And this technique, if he understood,
he could do many things,

03:37.079 --> 03:43.010
many more things than your forefathers
could do.

03:46.898 --> 03:56.186
Thus, materialism started taking its own
development in the minds of people.

03:56.387 --> 04:02.011
So the curse of human beings, at that time,
was materialism:

04:03.688 --> 04:09.526
when I felt that Sahasrara must be opened
out.

04:10.377 --> 04:15.797
Before that, people were just simple,
innocent: they all believed in God,

04:15.998 --> 04:25.233
they never doubted, and they didn’t even
seek the Truth.

04:25.948 --> 04:36.753
This materialism created such a competition
among human beings, such hypocrisy,

04:36.954 --> 04:46.780
that people started finding out that
this is not honest,

04:47.830 --> 04:56.493
materialism is not joy giving, you can’t
get peace out of materialism.

04:56.698 --> 04:59.647
Just it started developing into their
awareness

04:59.848 --> 05:03.402
that this is not the end of our
achievement,

05:03.603 --> 05:06.778
this is not what we have to know,

05:06.994 --> 05:13.411
this is not what is going to give us joy
and peace.

05:13.612 --> 05:21.022
Specially after war, this awareness started
growing very much among young people.

05:24.229 --> 05:28.113
This is also because,

05:28.314 --> 05:34.856
now, the human awareness had reached
the state of the brain.

05:35.057 --> 05:42.593
That’s how they started knowing better,
absorbing better and retaining better.

05:44.711 --> 05:48.029
You take a little child of today, he knows
much better

05:48.230 --> 05:53.007
than you would have known when you were
even 25 years of age;

05:53.208 --> 05:58.904
because he’s supposed to know about
everything.

06:01.651 --> 06:16.774
And thus, there was no movement towards
knowing what is the Truth.

06:17.218 --> 06:21.975
But, as this awareness grew more and more,

06:22.696 --> 06:28.406
lots of seekers were created on this earth.

06:29.382 --> 06:33.789
So many people, who never knew they were
seekers, suddenly became seekers.

06:33.990 --> 06:39.591
It’s a atmospheric effect, I should say.

06:40.067 --> 06:45.899
And thus, a new category of people were
born,

06:46.106 --> 06:52.587
became aware that they have to find out
the Truth.

06:52.788 --> 07:02.147
So, it was all simultaneously, according
to the time,

07:02.348 --> 07:07.676
that Sahasrara was to be opened out.

07:10.210 --> 07:14.921
And thus, this happened.

07:15.122 --> 07:21.109
For us Sahaja Yogis, of course, Sahasrar
is the biggest event.

07:21.310 --> 07:27.818
Or we should say – whatever work all
the incarnations have done,

07:28.019 --> 07:32.242
all the seers and saints and prophets
have done -

07:32.443 --> 07:35.884
this is the culminating point.

07:36.085 --> 07:42.661
They did it for individuals, but to do
for masses,

07:42.862 --> 07:52.112
that it should go to every nook and corner
of this world,

07:52.758 --> 07:59.010
is the ultimate end of all spiritual growth
all over,

07:59.211 --> 08:07.294
in every religion, through every great
incarnations and prophets.

08:07.495 --> 08:13.487
What they indicated about future, what they
talked about,

08:13.688 --> 08:26.337
what - you are to know yourself, that you
have to find your Self,

08:26.538 --> 08:29.836
that you have to become a realised soul,

08:30.037 --> 08:38.008
that you should have Atma Sakshatkar,
that you should be a wali.

08:38.209 --> 08:43.176
All these indications.

08:43.422 --> 08:47.968
Even the Buddhists know that Matreya has
to come.

08:48.169 --> 08:53.945
Ma-treya. “Ma” is Mother. Three times.
Trigunatmika.

08:54.146 --> 09:01.131
Even the Greeks had Athena with three
powers in Her.

09:01.332 --> 09:06.172
So, all of them have been predicting about
this time.

09:06.373 --> 09:14.463
And that time came and that’s how I call it
the blossom time

09:14.685 --> 09:20.148
and the fruits that are you people.

09:20.349 --> 09:31.600
So it is all so much, we can say, in
the cosmic cycle of different seasons –

09:31.809 --> 09:36.984
[that] this beautiful time has come and,
like the wheel of time,

09:37.185 --> 09:43.996
has to turn and go further - [that] Sahaja
Yoga started.

09:44.197 --> 09:51.663
Of course, in a very small way, but has
now grown so big all over the world.

09:53.131 --> 10:00.008
Here now, there’s another thing that has
happened,

10:00.209 --> 10:11.219
which is rather remarkable, that so far,
people used to meditate alone

10:11.420 --> 10:15.705
and maybe one of them might get
Realisation,

10:15.906 --> 10:20.041
but there was no phenomena of en masse
Realisation,

10:20.242 --> 10:23.829
nor of en masse meditation in those days.

10:24.030 --> 10:27.519
They all used to disappear into some
nook and corner

10:27.720 --> 10:31.623
of a quiet place where they would sit down
and meditate.

10:31.824 --> 10:39.995
But this en masse Realisation, en masse
meditation,

10:40.196 --> 10:47.026
en masse understanding and learning about
your being

10:47.227 --> 10:52.059
was not even imagined by Me:

10:52.260 --> 10:59.143
that it would go to such a limit, to such
an extent, with leaps and bounds.

10:59.344 --> 11:08.414
This year specially, it has taken a very
new dimension, I think, everywhere

11:08.615 --> 11:16.242
and all that is negative is being exposed
in most of the countries.

11:16.569 --> 11:22.594
So this is how, when the Sahasrara opened,

11:22.795 --> 11:28.588
the Kundalini started moving towards
this Divine Power,

11:28.789 --> 11:39.539
getting connected with It and was all
the time flowing within you,

11:39.865 --> 11:43.778
when the Nirvikalpa state came.

11:44.146 --> 11:50.127
Now when it is coming through
the Sahasrara,

11:50.460 --> 11:58.163
one has to know that the Sahasrara has
to be clean,

11:58.364 --> 12:12.427
so that the flow of Divine Power is going,
penetrating,

12:12.593 --> 12:18.368
without any obstacle, without getting
impure,

12:18.569 --> 12:25.695
without getting into any kind of problems.

12:26.024 --> 12:34.764
So, to get to that level, to that state,

12:34.965 --> 12:40.760
all the Sahaja Yogi, I am happy to know,
are trying to work it out,

12:40.961 --> 12:51.016
their own individual meditations also, so
that this growth should take place.

12:52.911 --> 13:00.809
Thus, you get enlightenment in a full way.

13:01.010 --> 13:06.787
But then one must ask why, for what?
What’s the purpose?

13:06.988 --> 13:15.283
What’s the aim? The aim is: your aim
is lost.

13:15.902 --> 13:20.437
You don’t seek for aims at all anymore.

13:21.134 --> 13:33.259
This pendal was built with such great
ability for which we didn’t pay anything.

13:33.460 --> 13:39.103
Everybody was working here day and night,
in the rainy season,

13:39.304 --> 13:44.319
and I was quite worried about them.
I said, “What’s the matter?”

13:44.520 --> 13:47.917
They said, “We are enjoying, Mother. We are
enjoying!” “What are you enjoying?”

13:48.118 --> 13:52.508
“We’re enjoying the rain.” All right.
“We are enjoying the cold.” All right.

13:52.709 --> 13:58.421
“Enjoying everything, lifting all these
heavy things, everything we are enjoying.”

13:59.209 --> 14:03.148
I was quite surprised at them. Nobody had
any complaints,

14:03.349 --> 14:11.877
but everybody was just on the warpath,
building this tent for you.

14:13.398 --> 14:17.744
So what happens? Once your Sahasrara
is clean,

14:17.945 --> 14:24.547
this flow of joy doesn’t allow you even
to think

14:24.748 --> 14:27.628
that you are exerting or you are working.

14:27.829 --> 14:34.165
Normally, if you tell somebody that this
is to be erected [they say], “Aaaaaah!”

14:34.366 --> 14:42.183
Some would faint and some would say,
“Ah, this will take at least one year.”

14:42.384 --> 14:45.172
Then they’ll start giving excuses.
“This pole is no good.

14:45.373 --> 14:50.568
That is no good. It won’t stand that.
There’s nothing, there’s nothing”.

14:50.769 --> 14:56.183
Ultimately, you’ll find nothing is done.
It will lie like this for years together.

14:56.354 --> 15:00.850
“You better get another person. You better
buy another one.”

15:01.051 --> 15:05.074
Everything is postponed all the time and
nothing is done.

15:05.275 --> 15:09.652
But here, you don’t feel you are doing
anything.

15:10.787 --> 15:14.559
When you don’t feel you are doing anything,
how can you say then, “Why?”

15:14.760 --> 15:20.883
Because I’m not doing anything, in any way,
so I don’t ask question “Why?” Do I?

15:21.084 --> 15:25.034
And in any case, I’m not doing anything.

15:26.905 --> 15:37.651
That is the state where you are working
in the Divine Plan.

15:37.852 --> 15:46.552
You are doing lot of work, but nobody feels
they are doing anything.

15:46.753 --> 15:52.179
They all think, we are absolutely just
enjoying ourselves, doing nothing.

15:52.380 --> 15:57.864
This kind of a state is the blessing
of Sahasrara.

15:58.065 --> 16:05.913
Because only in your brain you think
all these things, labour-saving devices.

16:06.114 --> 16:10.141
I mean, you tell anybody, “You go and
telephone to this person.”

16:10.342 --> 16:14.673
Immediately, if it is a modern one,
he’ll say, “He may not be there.

16:14.873 --> 16:17.617
God knows. What’s the use? Telephone
may not be all right.”

16:17.818 --> 16:23.556
“Baba, you see! Why don’t you see
if the telephone is all right or not?”

16:23.757 --> 16:27.372
Before that only he will give this hundred
and one explanations

16:27.573 --> 16:32.401
that it may not be all right, it maybe
something may be wrong

16:32.602 --> 16:39.996
and - just labour-saving, first thing.
That is one of the tricks of the brain.

16:40.197 --> 16:44.219
Then this intelligence cheats you
all the time.

16:44.420 --> 16:47.677
It gives you rationality for everything.

16:47.878 --> 16:50.974
Like a person kills his father and you ask
him, “Why did you kill?”

16:51.175 --> 16:54.591
“Why not? He was so old. He was suffering

16:54.792 --> 17:00.202
and I wanted to have all the property,
so I thought better kill him.”

17:02.166 --> 17:06.938
Like Queen Victoria became very old,
so her son was to think that,

17:07.139 --> 17:12.366
“I’ll never become a king if this lady
goes on like this!”

17:15.775 --> 17:20.273
So, the brain starts giving lots
of explanation and cheating –

17:20.474 --> 17:24.022
because rationality.

17:24.403 --> 17:31.957
It gives rationality and rationality is
nothing but ego or your conditioning.

17:32.158 --> 17:35.926
Your ego tells you, “No, this is no good,”

17:36.127 --> 17:40.053
so you stick on to that point,
“This is not good.”

17:40.254 --> 17:43.804
Then another can ask you why it is not
good.

17:44.005 --> 17:47.553
“I think it is not good, so? I think.”

17:47.754 --> 17:51.973
Or, like some say, “I believe,” but why?

17:52.174 --> 17:59.133
But in Sahaja Yoga answer is simple,
“Why do you do it?” – “I enjoy it.”

17:59.334 --> 18:06.373
What’s the next answer? “Why are you
worried? I am enjoying it.”

18:08.610 --> 18:11.995
Now the people who also say like that,

18:12.196 --> 18:16.003
because of their conditionings, “Oh,
I am enjoying it.”

18:16.204 --> 18:18.757
Somebody will say, “I enjoy my drink.”
Somebody can say,

18:18.958 --> 18:21.267
“I enjoy my going to the church.”

18:21.468 --> 18:25.775
Sometimes I say going – something else,
you see, like that.

18:25.976 --> 18:27.583
They are enjoying something,

18:27.784 --> 18:31.911
which, according to Sahaja Yoga, we too
can never enjoy.

18:32.080 --> 18:39.182
But that enjoyment is not collective.
That is not supported by anyone.

18:39.383 --> 18:43.873
For example, somebody says, “I enjoy
drinking.”

18:44.074 --> 18:50.223
Nobody has erected any temple or any
statue of a man who drinks.

18:50.424 --> 18:54.553
Have you seen anywhere in the whole world?

18:56.390 --> 19:07.509
So, though he may say that, “I enjoy,”
it has no sanction from the society.

19:08.352 --> 19:13.675
People can say, “I enjoy stealing,” people
can say, “I enjoy killing,”

19:13.876 --> 19:21.208
but it is very arbitrary, it is very
individual and never supported

19:21.409 --> 19:25.776
by the society, even by the modern society

19:26.895 --> 19:30.860
and there’s always reaction to it.

19:31.504 --> 19:35.961
But Sahaja Yoga is not like them. When
you say, “I enjoy,”

19:36.162 --> 19:41.678
you say it because you have no ego and
you have no conditionings.

19:41.879 --> 19:47.459
It’s a different situation because now
the Sahasrara is opened out.

19:47.660 --> 19:50.284
So, on one side your ego has gone down,

19:50.485 --> 19:57.127
another side your conditioning is finished.

19:57.328 --> 19:59.383
You are no more conditioned.

19:59.584 --> 20:06.614
Like you talk to a Catholic… so I started
talking about Christ.

20:06.815 --> 20:09.220
Immediately he said, “Mother, now, please.”

20:09.420 --> 20:14.308
I said, “I am talking about Christ,
not about Catholicism.

20:14.530 --> 20:17.034
Talking of Christ, what are you frightened
about?”

20:17.235 --> 20:19.330
“Mother, we shouldn’t become Catholic
again, you know.

20:19.531 --> 20:24.486
That’s why we are worried about.”
Baba, Christ never started Catholicism.

20:24.695 --> 20:32.659
So much so, they have developed a kind
of a de-conditioning of their minds,

20:33.048 --> 20:40.054
that they start seeing that whatever these
people have done so far was wrong,

20:40.255 --> 20:43.271
and that “Whatever I have done so far
was absolutely wrong

20:43.472 --> 20:49.621
and I’m not going do it.” It’s a very
common thing.

20:49.822 --> 20:54.327
I have seen the people who have worshipped
Christ prefer to worship Ganesha

20:54.528 --> 20:57.487
and those who have worshipped Ganesha
prefer to worship Christ.

20:57.688 --> 21:03.460
Just the same, the name is different,
but just the same, but they like it:

21:03.661 --> 21:08.222
because [to them] Christ means the priest,
the confessions,

21:08.423 --> 21:18.208
rosaries and also cemeteries. So they
don’t want to have.

21:19.097 --> 21:31.110
These conditionings, itself, start showing
their own forms, like devils,

21:31.319 --> 21:35.701
and Sahaja Yogis want to avoid it, or have
nothing to do with them.

21:35.902 --> 21:41.723
I remember in the beginning, we had about
six, seven hippies from England

21:41.924 --> 21:46.157
and they had come to Rahuri. We were
having a program

21:46.358 --> 21:48.914
and there were five, six real hippies.
These were hippies

21:49.115 --> 21:52.707
[who] became Sahaja Yogis, real hippies
came to the program.

21:52.908 --> 21:57.910
I was just sitting like this and suddenly
they said, “Ooooh nooooo!”

21:58.111 --> 22:01.391
I said, “What has happened?” I started
seeing;

22:01.592 --> 22:05.209
as if some snake has entered or what
has happened?

22:05.410 --> 22:13.513
They were hippies, but with this
de-conditioning of the conditions,

22:13.714 --> 22:21.450
they just couldn’t bear those same hippies –
that they [once] were – coming inside.

22:22.483 --> 22:30.314
Because you start seeing clearly, very
clearly,

22:30.515 --> 22:36.012
that all these conditionings had blinded us
completely

22:36.213 --> 22:42.385
and misled us into a wilderness.

22:42.809 --> 22:49.437
Of course, about ego, in the West people
are extremely conscious.

22:49.638 --> 22:53.077
There was a leader’s wife. I said,
“Why don’t you help your husband?”

22:53.278 --> 22:57.744
She said, “Mother, I’m worried about
my ego.” I said, “Why?”

22:57.945 --> 23:03.853
“If I start doing some work, this ego might
develop again, so I’m rather worried.”

23:04.054 --> 23:09.805
They are so conscious of it, that this ego
should not come back.

23:10.006 --> 23:15.200
One fellow who came to Me and I was
talking to him,

23:15.401 --> 23:19.922
then he just ran away. I said,
“What happened?”

23:20.123 --> 23:23.844
So he said, “No, those people who go close
to Mother always develop very bad ego.

23:24.045 --> 23:31.549
I don’t want to be there close with Her.”
So, it’s a such -

23:31.750 --> 23:38.602
such a mind that sees madness, that sees
insanity,

23:38.803 --> 23:41.915
that sees immaturity, it sees vulgarity,

23:42.116 --> 23:47.730
it sees deceit, hypocrisy, everything
so clearly:

23:47.931 --> 23:51.456
and in that state, he gets confused
and quite upset,

23:51.657 --> 23:55.594
wants to run away from everyone.

23:57.316 --> 24:02.850
Then we have some Sahaja Yogis who have
such problems,

24:03.051 --> 24:07.111
who come to Sahaja Yoga with problems.

24:07.312 --> 24:11.374
Then, these people see them with these
problems they are still continuing.

24:11.574 --> 24:14.371
Now the Sahasrara doesn’t want
to accept it.

24:14.572 --> 24:18.146
“It’s terrible. I was like him. No, no,
no, no more.

24:18.347 --> 24:21.252
Me, I don’t want to be that kind.”

24:21.453 --> 24:29.258
So they abhor the person who was just
like them;

24:29.459 --> 24:35.923
they just can’t bear him, they just can’t
tolerate him.

24:36.124 --> 24:41.051
Then I would say still you have to grow.

24:41.477 --> 24:46.804
You have to grow, your Sahasrara has to be
cleansed out

24:47.005 --> 24:53.400
at such a speed, at such a level and stage

24:53.601 --> 24:58.194
that, like soap cleanses everything,
it should cleanse everything else,

24:58.395 --> 25:05.482
should not be afraid of anything, should
not have any worry

25:05.683 --> 25:10.140
about the conditionings of others or ego
of others:

25:10.341 --> 25:13.238
that is the state now we have to reach.

25:13.439 --> 25:19.600
Today is the Sahasrara Day, is the 23rd
Sahasrara Day

25:20.977 --> 25:30.096
and I shouldn’t expect much, I don’t want
to say anything much about it:

25:30.297 --> 25:37.453
but I wish and I hope that all the thousand
petals of your Sahasraras

25:37.654 --> 25:42.452
will be so cleansed that you will never
catch from anybody;

25:42.653 --> 25:45.241
you will never be frightened of anybody.

25:45.442 --> 25:51.666
You will be masters of all kinds
of curatives

25:51.867 --> 26:04.396
and also you will be the one who can give
solace, peace to others;

26:04.597 --> 26:09.722
you will be the one who will be organising
programs outside,

26:09.923 --> 26:16.347
you will be the one who will be
responsible for Sahaja Yoga.

26:18.870 --> 26:22.670
And when that happens, then we can see

26:22.871 --> 26:30.345
that these thousand petals of the Sahasrara
have opened out.

26:37.703 --> 26:48.668
These thousand petals are not yet awakened.

26:48.869 --> 27:02.648
They signify the different thousand powers
of the Goddess, minimum of minimum.

27:03.624 --> 27:09.178
These thousand ones you can open out
yourself

27:09.379 --> 27:18.688
by introspection, by looking at yourself,
making fun of yourself.

27:18.889 --> 27:24.926
“Know Thyself” means know yourself
with all the defects you have

27:25.127 --> 27:30.490
and also the potential you have and all
the good points you have.

27:30.691 --> 27:35.078
So as far as you are concerned, when you
are looking at yourself

27:35.279 --> 27:39.506
you should just see to the defects that
you have.

27:39.737 --> 27:46.618
“Why do I behave like this? Why do I
assert so much?

27:46.819 --> 27:53.709
What’s the problem? Why can’t I see myself
clearly?”

27:53.910 --> 28:00.868
With that transparency of your Sahasrara,
you can see your heart,

28:01.069 --> 28:08.429
you can see your mind, you can see yourself
fully, clearly,

28:08.630 --> 28:11.915
what’s wrong with you.

28:12.435 --> 28:22.173
This transparency can come only if you
have really

28:23.378 --> 28:32.224
the pure desire, shuddha iccha, to be
of that level.

28:32.886 --> 28:42.203
Now, there is no competition between
A and B.

28:42.404 --> 28:48.282
We don’t say that, “You got the first prize
for coming out of the Sahasrara”

28:48.483 --> 28:54.230
or we don’t say, “You have the second
prize.”

28:54.950 --> 28:59.622
There’s nothing like first, second
in Sahaja Yoga,

29:00.963 --> 29:09.326
because we are not running the race.
There’s no competition between us.

29:09.527 --> 29:13.653
Whatever we are doing is for our
own satisfaction.

29:13.854 --> 29:19.013
Now think of something. There are five
people who are running.

29:19.214 --> 29:24.632
Now they have to think, out of these five
people, who goes first.

29:24.833 --> 29:31.161
Here it is the other way round: the five
people are meditating;

29:31.362 --> 29:39.707
now everyone individually has to see for
himself if he satisfies himself or not,

29:40.251 --> 29:42.565
nobody else is going to give you
a certificate.

29:42.766 --> 29:48.083
It is you who has to give certificate
to yourself, honestly.

29:48.284 --> 29:51.586
It’s a very different position.

29:51.787 --> 29:57.493
It is you, your Sahasrara and your
attention

29:57.694 --> 30:01.521
and you have to see, within yourself,

30:01.722 --> 30:08.757
“How far have I realised my own powers,

30:08.958 --> 30:16.465
my own compassion, my own personality?”

30:16.909 --> 30:26.269
You’ll have to test it yourself. It is you
are the one who decides.

30:26.470 --> 30:29.745
When you are the one who is running,

30:29.946 --> 30:36.988
it is you are the one who decides without
running,

30:37.189 --> 30:41.682
then what is the question of competition?

30:43.955 --> 30:51.962
The whole thing disappears into nothing.

30:52.763 --> 30:56.866
As I told you the other day, an analogy

30:57.067 --> 31:05.849
that, if you are looking at the mirror,
then you are the one who is observing,

31:06.050 --> 31:14.792
your reflection is the one that is observed
and there is the action of seeing,

31:14.993 --> 31:23.341
so you are in three dimensions. But
supposing you become the mirror yourself,

31:26.777 --> 31:33.290
the whole process is reversed: You see
yourself.

31:33.491 --> 31:36.435
You don’t have to see because you are
seeing it all the time,

31:36.636 --> 31:38.793
it’s just spontaneous.

31:38.994 --> 31:44.214
In the same manner, when it comes
to Sahasrara,

31:44.415 --> 31:50.692
it is your Sahasrara itself gives you
the full idea as to how you are.

31:50.877 --> 31:55.276
The diagnosis comes from your own
Sahasrara.

31:55.696 --> 31:59.321
Your own Sahasrara tells you what centres
are catching

31:59.522 --> 32:05.306
because all the peethas of these seven
centres are in the Sahasrara.

32:05.579 --> 32:13.117
As if the Sahasrara is now watching
yourself

32:13.318 --> 32:16.204
and reporting to you, “See, this is wrong
with you.

32:16.405 --> 32:19.043
This is wrong with you, this is wrong
with you.”

32:19.244 --> 32:23.558
So, Sahasrara being the best well-wisher
that you have,

32:23.759 --> 32:26.476
gives you the right information about
yourself,

32:26.677 --> 32:30.270
so the best is that you correct yourself.

32:30.471 --> 32:38.490
So then, achieve that perfect state:
that is what you have to do.

32:38.691 --> 32:41.127
But once you have achieved the perfect
state,

32:41.328 --> 32:46.019
you have achieved your aim, you have
no aim left.

32:46.384 --> 32:51.922
Like the lights now, till you have to make
the lights, you had to work hard,

32:52.123 --> 32:59.196
make the lights, put them right, do
everything that is necessary.

32:59.397 --> 33:02.027
But once it is made and the light comes
into it,

33:02.228 --> 33:11.937
then the job of the light is to give
the light.

33:12.138 --> 33:16.444
So the first function is over.

33:18.895 --> 33:25.107
Now the second function is to give it back.

33:26.181 --> 33:29.722
You reach your aim, your destination.

33:29.923 --> 33:32.510
For example, I had to come here. All right?

33:32.711 --> 33:37.814
So I come all the way from My house,
come in the car,

33:38.015 --> 33:45.561
walking and come and sit down here.
Now it’s finished that part, over.

33:45.762 --> 33:51.497
Now I don’t have to walk, otherwise
I’ll be all the time running.

33:51.698 --> 33:57.422
So, all this mad race of this brain stops.

33:57.623 --> 34:03.096
For what should it be used now?

34:03.648 --> 34:09.514
For enjoying the peace, for enjoying
the joy,

34:09.715 --> 34:14.383
for enjoying the collectivity.

34:14.771 --> 34:19.930
So, the labour or the hard work

34:20.131 --> 34:23.878
or you can also say the planning
of the future finishes off.

34:24.079 --> 34:29.038
Only thing now you have got it, so better
enjoy it.

34:29.913 --> 34:38.817
It’s like you are coming from outside,

34:39.018 --> 34:42.798
you are running, you are very hungry,
you want to reach home.

34:42.999 --> 34:47.488
Once you reach home, then the food
is served to you.

34:47.689 --> 34:50.783
Now what’s your aim?

34:50.984 --> 34:55.224
Nothing, but to enjoy the food for which
you were running.

34:55.425 --> 34:59.041
But after that also, if you start running,

34:59.248 --> 35:04.956
then one should say it is absolute
stupidity.

35:05.659 --> 35:14.514
But the capacity of enjoyment only comes
when your Sahasrara is absolutely open.

35:14.715 --> 35:19.821
Otherwise, the capacity to enjoy is much
less

35:20.022 --> 35:24.506
and you become like a person who is running
all the time

35:24.707 --> 35:30.726
after something which you never achieve.
There are many like that.

35:30.927 --> 35:34.777
All their lives they are like mad,
you know.

35:34.978 --> 35:41.292
They are working morning till evening,
every day, achieving nothing.

35:41.493 --> 35:46.247
Next day again get up, again running.
All their lives running like this,

35:46.448 --> 35:52.490
till their foot is in the grave, they are
still running.

35:53.333 --> 36:01.351
But after getting to Sahaja Yoga, you stop
all these activities

36:01.552 --> 36:08.956
and leave it to your Sahaja Yoga to work,
to your Sahasrara to work it out.

36:09.157 --> 36:16.470
And it works out. You don’t have to rush.
You don’t have to be so competent.

36:16.671 --> 36:20.220
You don’t have to write down everything.
You don’t have to think

36:20.421 --> 36:27.584
of planning everything. Just everything
works out and it works out beautifully.

36:27.785 --> 36:34.682
The only thing that one has to do is to
accept whatever is happening for our good.

36:34.883 --> 36:39.080
Even in small, small things.

36:40.065 --> 36:45.187
For today’s delay in the puja, is
the desire of some people

36:45.388 --> 36:48.778
who wanted to give you some sort of a …
I shouldn't say that,

36:48.979 --> 36:58.289
but some secret show was going to be there
and they didn’t want any light.

36:58.490 --> 37:02.663
So they were thinking, “What will happen –
the puja will be over by about five,

37:02.864 --> 37:06.129
then by six o’clock they’ll eat their food,
but the sun would be there

37:06.330 --> 37:10.257
till nine o’clock, then how can we show
this?”

37:10.458 --> 37:14.371
All right, so have it in the night.

37:14.572 --> 37:19.903
In every small thing you will see.

37:20.104 --> 37:25.015
Some people were coming from India and
they had to bring My two boxes from there

37:25.216 --> 37:30.721
and they wouldn’t allow these boxes,
they said it is overweight, overweight.

37:30.922 --> 37:33.916
So they didn’t know what to do. They
thought that they should send them back

37:34.117 --> 37:40.124
and later on it can go till Guru puja
or somewhere.

37:40.325 --> 37:45.268
But they thought that there must be some
plan, must be some drama.

37:45.469 --> 37:52.021
The plane was late [by] 19 hours, so they
thought there must be some drama;

37:52.222 --> 38:00.288
and then they were put into some sort
of a tourist hotel for that night.

38:00.489 --> 38:14.530
Next morning, they met two other Indians
from, Sahaja Yogis, from Poona, two boys.

38:14.976 --> 38:20.666
That settled it! My luggage, they could
put it in their name

38:20.867 --> 38:27.447
and that’s how the luggage came in.
But they never felt bored: 19 hours.

38:27.648 --> 38:31.006
“We had nice time, Mother, together.
We were enjoying and talking”,

38:31.207 --> 38:35.156
finished! Nobody feels that time is passing
out.

38:35.357 --> 38:44.492
Otherwise, anybody else would have eaten up
all the airport personnel

38:44.693 --> 38:47.950
and would have broken all the telephones.

38:48.151 --> 38:51.184
“Waiting for 19 hours, my God, what is
this!”

38:51.385 --> 38:55.841
Would have given it in the newspapers,
everyone, as this is the greatest crime!

38:56.042 --> 39:01.000
While these were enjoying life nicely.

39:01.350 --> 39:07.787
So, we have lost now the sense of aim.
We don’t have any aims.

39:07.988 --> 39:11.271
We just want to enjoy.

39:12.672 --> 39:16.377
It’s a very, very big thing that has
happened

39:16.578 --> 39:24.966
because, as you know, the joy in the
Sahasrara is nira-ananda, nira-ananda.

39:25.167 --> 39:35.488
Of course, Nira is My name also, but it
means pure absolute joy.

39:35.689 --> 39:38.971
Nira-ananda.

39:40.256 --> 39:45.553
And that nirananda, that joy has no other
hues.

39:45.754 --> 39:50.284
It’s just pure, pure joy.

39:50.909 --> 39:54.460
Without thinking, it just pours into it.

39:54.661 --> 39:57.304
After all, every activity is for what?

39:57.505 --> 40:01.925
For getting some sort of a pleasure,
sensation

40:02.126 --> 40:06.139
and also, some people believe, for joy.
It’s not.

40:06.340 --> 40:10.037
Only after the opening of Sahasrara
and the cleansing of it,

40:10.238 --> 40:14.227
then you will know what is joy. You can’t
explain it,

40:14.428 --> 40:19.502
how you can spend hours together like this.
People don’t understand, you know.

40:19.703 --> 40:22.112
Like even our mayor was telling Me that,

40:22.313 --> 40:25.309
“We can’t sit in the church for more
than fifteen minutes.

40:25.510 --> 40:30.519
And how people are sitting here for
so many hours?

40:30.720 --> 40:34.634
Fifteen minutes we cannot sit, but how
these people are sitting

40:34.835 --> 40:38.643
for such a long time?  What are they
doing there?

40:38.844 --> 40:43.469
What is their entertainment? How can they
sit for hours together?

40:43.670 --> 40:47.426
Without saying anything, without dropping
even a pin,

40:47.627 --> 40:50.397
they are just all the time there.

40:50.598 --> 40:54.268
So what have you given them? What is
happening to them?”

40:54.469 --> 41:00.518
This is very surprising and remarkable
that these people,

41:00.719 --> 41:03.894
who are not even Sahaja Yogis, can see
clearly

41:04.095 --> 41:09.269
that you people are least bothered, you
are absolutely enjoying life.

41:09.470 --> 41:14.609
Whatever you may be doing is not important,
what is important is

41:14.810 --> 41:18.504
that, whether you are working in the office
or outside,

41:18.705 --> 41:23.316
you are full of joy, enjoying everything.

41:23.517 --> 41:26.331
This is the most important thing in life,

41:26.532 --> 41:30.680
which you can have only through Sahaja
Yoga,

41:30.881 --> 41:37.418
because your Sahasraras are open, because
they are opened out.

41:37.619 --> 41:42.460
There is now one more thing I have
to tell you,

41:42.661 --> 41:47.546
that is very important for all of you
to remember:

41:47.747 --> 41:56.032
that, while living in this Ocean of Joy,
we have to remember

41:56.233 --> 42:00.373
that there are many who have not yet jumped
into it,

42:00.574 --> 42:05.780
so we have to bring them in; and it’s such
a pleasure, it’s such a joy

42:05.981 --> 42:11.324
to give realisation to someone, extremely
joyful.

42:11.525 --> 42:16.478
So we need people who would come and
say that,

42:16.679 --> 42:21.805
“We’ll definitely come for this [work].”

42:23.102 --> 42:28.191
I mean, they should really come forward

42:28.392 --> 42:35.260
and, once they come forward, you’ll be
amazed how things will work out.

42:35.461 --> 42:40.531
There are many, I know, who are going
all over, everywhere

42:40.732 --> 42:43.776
and spreading Sahaja Yoga.

42:43.977 --> 42:49.167
So is very important for all of you to know
that you have got the light

42:49.368 --> 42:52.991
to be given to others. Come forward.

42:53.192 --> 42:57.586
Don’t have fear of your ego, conditionings,
nothing. Come forward.

42:57.787 --> 43:01.672
You have all the strength, you have
everything within yourself

43:01.873 --> 43:06.156
and you will do everything with such
happiness and joy.

43:06.357 --> 43:08.911
Everywhere, in every country people
are doing that,

43:09.112 --> 43:12.064
but some of them are doing, some of them
are not doing.

43:12.265 --> 43:18.624
All of you are quite capable of doing it,
so please come forward

43:18.825 --> 43:23.474
and see for yourself what you are
capable of.

43:25.228 --> 43:28.449
First of all, you should have faith
in yourself.

43:28.650 --> 43:32.527
If you have no faith in yourself, you
cannot do anything.

43:32.728 --> 43:38.825
Have faith. You should have no fears
of any kind.

43:39.026 --> 43:49.497
And also, to introspect, to see within
yourself what’s going on.

43:49.698 --> 43:53.996
To be very frank, I find My brain
absolutely empty.

43:54.197 --> 43:57.695
What I talk from this emptiness, I don’t
know.

43:57.896 --> 44:02.715
You will also find your brain absolutely
empty,

44:03.040 --> 44:09.599
and still with that empty brain, you will
be achieving a lot.

44:09.800 --> 44:14.148
It’s very remarkable, as you have seen that
from the candle you get cool breeze.

44:14.357 --> 44:17.894
How you can get it from the candle,
cool breeze?

44:18.095 --> 44:21.371
You do get.

44:22.679 --> 44:28.236
So, is important to recognise yourself
as a Sahaja Yogi

44:28.437 --> 44:37.590
and to recognise what have you done
for Sahaja Yoga.

44:38.733 --> 44:42.802
Without doing for Sahaja Yoga, you cannot
enjoy life.

44:43.003 --> 44:47.905
That was your aim, and that aim you have
reached.

44:48.106 --> 44:51.409
Now, if you don’t… supposing I have to come
and sit on this thing

44:51.610 --> 44:56.677
and I don’t sit on this thing, then what’s
the use of coming here?

44:57.691 --> 45:01.166
I came here to tell you something about
Sahasrara

45:01.367 --> 45:04.761
and if I don’t tell you, then what’s
the use of My coming here

45:04.962 --> 45:07.998
and celebrating Sahasrara Day?

45:08.183 --> 45:11.622
In the same way, when you have reached
that state now,

45:11.823 --> 45:14.156
what you have to do is not to use for your
own purpose.

45:14.357 --> 45:18.991
You have used it, quite a lot, for your
health, wealth, everything.

45:19.192 --> 45:22.557
Now what are we doing about Sahaja Yoga?

45:22.758 --> 45:26.008
What have we done for Sahaja Yoga?

45:26.936 --> 45:29.585
After some time, you will do a lot and
you will never know

45:29.786 --> 45:32.914
you have done anything for Sahaja Yoga.

45:33.115 --> 45:40.798
Very surprising, it happens to so many
of you and should happen to all of you.

45:40.999 --> 45:46.916
I hope all of you will realise that your
Sahasraras are cleaned, completely,

45:47.117 --> 45:50.048
you are perfectly all right, you don’t have
to worry about it,

45:50.249 --> 45:58.329
and you can really go ahead with spreading
of Sahaja Yoga.

45:58.530 --> 46:00.682
May God bless you all.
