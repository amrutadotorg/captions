WEBVTT

00:00:01.207 --> 00:00:09.347
Today is Shivratri and in Shivratri we
are going to worship Lord Shiva.

00:00:14.501 --> 00:00:33.011
On the outside, we are our body and its
various aspects like mind, ego, intellect
etc.

00:00:37.418 --> 00:00:49.428
All these are outside and in the
outer realm we can control them.

00:00:50.548 --> 00:01:07.418
Similarly, whatever is created in the
universe,

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.985
we can know it and we can
put it to use.

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:29.629
In the same way, whatever elements
are there in the Earth, and whatever
grows out of it, we can use them.

00:01:32.768 --> 00:01:46.238
We can gain complete supremacy
over all this. But all this is an outside
covering.

00:01:50.514 --> 00:02:07.344
What we are within, is the Spirit.
Whatever is outside is mortal.

00:02:09.376 --> 00:02:18.116
Whatever is born, will die. What
is created, will be destroyed.

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:25.929
But within our innermost is our Atma,
who is our Shiva,

00:02:26.168 --> 00:02:38.638
which is a reflection of Sadashiva,
it is indestructible, selfless and
free-spirited.

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:45.519
It is not wrapped in anything, it is
unblemished.

00:02:52.978 --> 00:03:00.168
By identifying ourselves with that Shiva
or getting illuminated with the Light
of that Shiva,

00:03:01.663 --> 00:03:16.923
we also slowly become ascetic. On the
outside is just a covering.

00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:31.241
It remains as it is. But within the
innermost, is the atma which is
unalterable, indestructible,
immortal.

00:03:32.794 --> 00:03:40.464
It is always emitting light from its
position.

00:03:40.731 --> 00:03:49.151
Then after Self-realization our life
becomes Divine, magnificent and holy.

00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:59.131
Therefore, it is essential for a human
being to attain self realization.

00:03:59.647 --> 00:04:03.317
Without that, we cannot have balance
in our life

00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:14.741
and cannot be truly collective, cannot
have true love.

00:04:16.158 --> 00:04:22.548
And above all, we cannot know the
Truth.

00:04:24.278 --> 00:04:29.748
So, all the knowledge which is called
pure knowledge

00:04:29.944 --> 00:04:37.114
can be understood only in the light of
the Spirit.

00:04:38.556 --> 00:04:44.106
When one becomes enlightened by the
light of the Spirit,

00:04:46.505 --> 00:04:52.275
then his eyes also become pure.
He just watches.

00:04:52.947 --> 00:05:01.767
While watching, he does not get
involved in anything.

00:05:01.767 --> 00:05:10.331
Just by watching, he gets the complete
knowledge of that thing.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:20.450
But when a person is not Self-realized,

00:05:21.263 --> 00:05:27.300
then in a way, he always thinks only
of himself.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:36.746
He thinks, what will he eat today, when
and at whose place did he get good
food,

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.873
what food should be arranged today.

00:05:40.731 --> 00:05:48.121
Or he thinks: “Where should I go today?

00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:53.351
At which place will I feel my
importance? Where will people believe
in me?

00:05:53.447 --> 00:05:57.227
In which gathering will I gain
prominence?”

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:04.565
The other style of person will think
about how to make more money,

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.840
The other style of person will think
about how to make more money,

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.288
gain the entire wealth of the worlds
and put the world right.

00:06:12.173 --> 00:06:18.223
Another kind of person thinks, only
about his children, grandchildren,
relatives, etc.

00:06:18.223 --> 00:06:20.710
Another kind of person thinks, only
about his children, grandchildren,
relatives, etc.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.962
Another kind of person thinks, only
about his children, grandchildren,
relatives, etc.

00:06:23.962 --> 00:06:32.131
These kinds of thoughts which are self
-centred like: “What is my position?

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:40.800
These kinds of thoughts which are self
-centred like: “What is my position?

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:52.069
What great advantage I will get out of
this? What clothes should I wear.

00:06:52.069 --> 00:07:02.456
How should I impress people so they
think how clever I am, how great I am?”

00:07:02.456 --> 00:07:09.682
How should I impress people so they
think how clever I am, how great I am?”

00:07:09.682 --> 00:07:15.177
How should I impress people so they
think how clever I am, how great I am?”

00:07:15.231 --> 00:07:19.541
Another person is one who considers
himself very humble

00:07:19.541 --> 00:07:29.628
and keeps bowing before everyone, to
show how he respects everyone?

00:07:29.628 --> 00:07:34.128
How cultured I am?

00:07:34.516 --> 00:07:40.426
The third person says, I am so learned
and will have a discussion with
intellectuals

00:07:40.426 --> 00:07:45.870
and read many books to show off his
knowledge.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:57.257
to show off his knowledge.

00:07:57.257 --> 00:08:03.248
to show off his knowledge.

00:08:03.248 --> 00:08:08.234
And another one thinks like this about
his music or art.

00:08:08.234 --> 00:08:11.439
And another one thinks like this about
his music or art.

00:08:11.439 --> 00:08:21.346
How best to impress others is what
man thinks most.

00:08:21.346 --> 00:08:25.744
People also do lots of social work, it’s
not that they don’t do it.

00:08:25.744 --> 00:08:31.178
For example, if someone is drowning
and another person jumps in to save
him,

00:08:31.178 --> 00:08:35.985
he does so with the feeling that the
same ”I”ness that exists within him,

00:08:35.985 --> 00:08:40.380
it also exists in the other person.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.547
He doesn’t think consciously that the
man is drowning and must be saved.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:50.390
Man also does many bigger things than
this. He also sacrifices for his country

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:54.850
because he thinks that this is my
country and the people of my country
should be happy.”

00:08:54.850 --> 00:09:00.174
In this way sublimity begins to arise
within him. Greatness begins to
manifest in him.

00:09:00.174 --> 00:09:03.681
Then someone thinks that “My art
should spread in such a way

00:09:03.681 --> 00:09:10.274
that the art of my country gets spread
all over the world.”

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:18.640
In this way man becomes happy seeing
himself getting dissolved in the
collective.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:25.570
But in all this, there is in him an
expectation for victory,

00:09:25.906 --> 00:09:32.806
recognition and praise from others.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:37.320
That is why he gets stuck in the whirl of
joy and sorrow.

00:09:37.897 --> 00:09:42.777
It is expected by him that his name
should appear everywhere,

00:09:42.777 --> 00:09:47.460
that people should respect him greatly
and give him recognition,

00:09:47.856 --> 00:09:52.826
and wherever he is, he should never be
insulted.

00:09:52.826 --> 00:09:56.316
and wherever he is, he should never be
insulted.

00:09:57.111 --> 00:10:05.371
No matter how great an organiser a
person may become, if he is not self
realised,

00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:16.213
then the center of his being-the point
of “I”,the ego- remains focused on
himself.

00:10:16.213 --> 00:10:21.811
Even if the circle of his influence
becomes vast, his attention does not
extend

00:10:23.274 --> 00:10:26.194
to that circle but remains centered only
on that “I”.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:38.420
But when he becomes one with his
Spirit, then he thinks differently.

00:10:39.646 --> 00:10:45.256
Then for everything he thinks, how to
use this thing

00:10:45.948 --> 00:10:50.848
for the benefit of society and for the
world at large.

00:10:51.106 --> 00:10:58.666
What can be done for people who are
suffering internally and what should be
done about it.

00:10:58.975 --> 00:11:03.115
His whole thinking shifts from self
-interest to these things.

00:11:03.577 --> 00:11:07.847
When he looks at a tree, he thinks

00:11:07.847 --> 00:11:13.480
how beautifully God has made this tree.
If only, I too were so beautiful.

00:11:13.498 --> 00:11:19.888
If only I too, were shade giving so that
people would come and rest in my
shade.

00:11:19.888 --> 00:11:22.813
But I am not like that. I should become
like that

00:11:22.912 --> 00:11:26.992
and then, he begins to sing in praise of
that tree.

00:11:26.992 --> 00:11:31.529
If he sees the Himalayas then he starts
singing praises of the Himalayas.

00:11:31.569 --> 00:11:37.179
But the one who constantly seeks for
self realisation, who does not know his
Spirit,

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:41.990
will keep singing his own praises,
“That I went to the Himalayas.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:46.831
I did this in the Himalayas.Make my
grave in the Himalayas.

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:53.205
Put the flag of my country in the
Himalayas”.

00:11:53.654 --> 00:12:02.134
Like this there are two levels or two
types of human beings.

00:12:02.487 --> 00:12:09.537
The ones who are Realized souls and by
the Light of the Spirit,

00:12:11.647 --> 00:12:17.377
they see everything.

00:12:18.251 --> 00:12:25.471
They never think that by doing this or
that,

00:12:25.471 --> 00:12:32.748
they will get a great name, or people
will praise them.

00:12:32.892 --> 00:12:41.582
Even if someone kills them, tortures,
deceives

00:12:41.582 --> 00:12:48.230
or criticizes them, they never mind it.

00:12:48.666 --> 00:12:54.146
Like you can see Jesus Christ who was
crucified.

00:12:54.467 --> 00:13:02.627
But while on the cross, he prayed that
“O Lord of the universe,

00:13:02.682 --> 00:13:08.672
forgive them, for they do not know what
mistake they are committing”.

00:13:08.672 --> 00:13:13.942
Because He was concerned that when
these people have tormented Him so
much, don’t know what will happen to
them?

00:13:16.851 --> 00:13:23.681
Anyone who is self-realized, he is
indifferent.

00:13:23.681 --> 00:13:28.474
He has no allurement within him that
this has to happen,

00:13:29.272 --> 00:13:34.692
this has to be done, he does not have
resolve for something.

00:13:35.132 --> 00:13:39.502
If it gets done, fine, If it doesn’t then
also it’s alright.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:47.460
And when he does not seek praise or
fame,

00:13:47.715 --> 00:13:53.315
when there is no expectation in him,
he does not get stuck into the whirl of
joy and sorrow.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.146
The joy and sorrow are identical for him.

00:13:58.668 --> 00:14:03.378
If there is sorrow, he can face that and
if there is joy, he witnesses that also.

00:14:03.429 --> 00:14:06.559
And he understands that it is like day
and night.

00:14:08.967 --> 00:14:14.597
He himself is overwhelmed with joy
because he knows that the spirit
is the source of joy.

00:14:14.893 --> 00:14:20.473
Immersed in the source of bliss.
He does not hanker after anything.

00:14:20.812 --> 00:14:24.162
He never has a longing

00:14:24.162 --> 00:14:28.433
to seize what belongs to others, or to
manipulate things for himself.

00:14:28.433 --> 00:14:30.366
Such thoughts never arise in his mind.

00:14:30.569 --> 00:14:34.189
He never has to control his mind.

00:14:34.189 --> 00:14:40.196
They say that “control your mind,
control your senses.”

00:14:40.196 --> 00:14:43.738
But in his case, everything comes under
complete control.

00:14:43.738 --> 00:14:47.615
He has no desire to control anything,

00:14:47.615 --> 00:14:53.785
he never feels tempted to have
something,” and then dying to get that.

00:14:53.785 --> 00:14:59.809
There are such people who run after
something new as if

00:14:59.809 --> 00:15:03.675
their whole life depends on it and when
they get that,

00:15:03.675 --> 00:15:06.992
then they start running after something
else.

00:15:06.992 --> 00:15:11.801
When they cannot get it, then they feel
so upset about it,

00:15:11.801 --> 00:15:16.339
that they think their whole life is
finished.

00:15:16.691 --> 00:15:23.610
Then the attention of such a person

00:15:24.131 --> 00:15:30.851
is very scared and they are very
cautious and alert about everything.

00:15:30.851 --> 00:15:35.280
But a Realized Soul’s attention is such
that he moves through life knowing
everything. There is so much power in
his attention (Chita) that where his
attention goes,

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:40.954
it starts working. ‘Chitta’ or attention is
the gift of Shri Brahamdeva.

00:15:42.914 --> 00:15:48.544
When only the Brahma remains of
Brahamdeva,

00:15:50.231 --> 00:15:58.781
then this attention becomes so
powerful, so loving,

00:15:59.361 --> 00:16:05.811
so knowledgeable and so capable,

00:16:06.472 --> 00:16:10.982
that it does its work in a very easy way.

00:16:12.125 --> 00:16:19.715
What it means is that the attention of
such a person becomes one with the
Param Chaitanya or Divine vibrations

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:26.401
and when oneness with this
paramchaitanya happens,

00:16:26.401 --> 00:16:29.723
then the Param Chaitanya does all the
work.

00:16:29.723 --> 00:16:41.741
So whatever work of this world is to be
done, it is done by the Brahma Shakti,
by the Param Chaitanya.

00:16:42.301 --> 00:16:51.201
When a person is doing these deeds
then at that time he does not think that
he is doing it.

00:16:51.516 --> 00:16:55.506
Does not mean that he has no feeling
about it.

00:16:56.020 --> 00:17:01.128
He just thinks that it is happening. It is
occurring.

00:17:01.128 --> 00:17:05.234
This is getting materialised. It is like to
get to a state of inaction.

00:17:05.234 --> 00:17:11.456
Because Param Chaitanya does
everything and I am just a medium in
between.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:17.473
It happens only through the light of the
Spirit. Otherwise it can never happen.

00:17:17.473 --> 00:17:20.841
If a person says, “I do all the work and
leave it to God,”

00:17:20.841 --> 00:17:24.970
it doesn’t happen that way and it is a
lie. One who thinks like that

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:28.547
is deceiving himself and is standing
upon untruth.

00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:32.366
The truth is that Param Chaitanya is
doing everything

00:17:32.366 --> 00:17:39.372
in a very easy manner. Such beautiful is
its skill and its tactics

00:17:39.372 --> 00:17:43.237
that a person wonders at how it does
its work.

00:17:43.485 --> 00:17:53.805
And When a man accepts that
chaitanya in his huge heart

00:17:56.171 --> 00:18:08.521
in the form of immense faith and his
whole heart,(inaudible)

00:18:08.521 --> 00:18:15.359
his entire being becomes so illuminated
by the power of that Spirit

00:18:15.359 --> 00:18:26.484
that he attains oneness with that subtle
consciousness.

00:18:26.599 --> 00:18:31.240
That oneness is so amazing.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.921
Many people tell me, “Mother, such a
great miracle happened,

00:18:34.992 --> 00:18:40.912
I merely prayed, and the work was
done! Such a big miracle happened.”

00:18:41.154 --> 00:18:47.794
We do not do any deeds. Param
chaitanya performs all the deeds.

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:52.600
All deeds are done by Him, it is only our
illusion that makes us think we are
doing them.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:56.651
We can only take some dead thing and
make other dead things from it –

00:18:56.651 --> 00:19:00.641
like from silver we make jewellery and
then think what a great thing we have
done.

00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:05.561
But all the living work is done by the
Param Chaitanya

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:11.290
and this donation of Param chaitanya
that we have received,

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:18.111
the experience of it is only through
Self-realization.

00:19:18.405 --> 00:19:22.380
Because Param Chaitanya is the Adi
Shakti

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:30.181
who is the Power of the Desire of Shri
Shiva.It is His light.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:40.540
By the grace of this Param Chaitanya
only, you will be doing everything

00:19:40.962 --> 00:19:46.952
and when this happens within you,you
can become wonderful people.
Wonderful.

00:19:48.393 --> 00:19:55.773
But when the feeling comes in you that
“I” am doing this,“I” have done this,

00:19:56.109 --> 00:20:01.290
”I” want to do this or any kind of
forceful thought,whatever it may be

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:07.730
then it means that you have not yet got
the light of the Spirit within you.

00:20:09.388 --> 00:20:13.408
So, all the work is being done by Param
chaitanya..

00:20:18.186 --> 00:20:21.996
You have entered a state of non-action,
‘akarma’, when you are not doing
anything at all.

00:20:21.996 --> 00:20:25.372
Like if this bulb says that I am giving
electricity, then it is wrong.

00:20:27.843 --> 00:20:34.533
Those who are Realized souls, within
them this Param Chaitanya is doing
everything.

00:20:34.677 --> 00:20:39.477
The one who has made you, given you
shape your body,

00:20:39.477 --> 00:20:43.559
whatever is made is by the blessings of
Param chaitanya.

00:20:43.559 --> 00:20:48.135
After becoming human beings, you
have now become realized souls,After
becoming human beings, you have now
become realized souls,

00:20:48.135 --> 00:20:58.579
So how can such a person be egoistical,

00:21:00.796 --> 00:21:04.376
when he knows that “I can do nothing”.

00:21:05.135 --> 00:21:08.625
Like there is an artist holding a brush in
his hands

00:21:08.625 --> 00:21:13.767
and the brush knows,“I do nothing; it is
the artist who creates.”

00:21:13.767 --> 00:21:20.951
Let me tell you about Krishna, the flute
of Shri Krishna said

00:21:21.583 --> 00:21:28.443
that why do people say, “I am
emanating sound? It is krishna who
plays through me. I am hollow.”

00:21:28.676 --> 00:21:35.336
So this hollowness which is called
egolessness,

00:21:35.336 --> 00:21:42.630
which when gets established within us
fully, then we can think

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:51.659
that what I thought that ‘I am doing this
work or that work’

00:21:51.659 --> 00:21:58.165
is actually so troublesome.

00:21:58.345 --> 00:22:02.925
Because I was doing this work and ‘I’
did that work

00:22:02.925 --> 00:22:07.609
and it did not produce any result, so I
become very upset.

00:22:09.213 --> 00:22:15.683
So now I did this and got a great name
and it goes to my head.

00:22:18.592 --> 00:22:33.632
But (a Realized Soul knows) “I” have not
done this work,It is all the skill of the
Param Chaitanya, so whatever has
happened is alright.

00:22:33.635 --> 00:22:39.205
Supposing we lost our way, we took the
wrong way.

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:45.350
At that time one may think that I have
gone the wrong way,it was a big
mistake,

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:47.378
I should not have come this way.

00:22:47.788 --> 00:22:54.628
But a Realized Soul thinks this had to
happen,it may have been necessary to
go that way, so I am going.

00:22:54.628 --> 00:22:59.366
So he does not feel bad, he is not in
pain.

00:22:59.383 --> 00:23:06.183
He is not going to think, why did I come
this way, had I not come this wayit
would have been better,

00:23:06.183 --> 00:23:10.745
I should not have come the wrong
way.He does not think like that. He says,
“It’s all right”.

00:23:11.164 --> 00:23:17.514
You may put a thousand dishes before
him and ask, “how is it?”He’ll say, “very
good.”

00:23:17.667 --> 00:23:25.167
Offer him just a little sauce or some
greens and “how was it?” He will
say,“excellent”.

00:23:26.452 --> 00:23:29.822
You might wonder, “What kind of person
is this? He seems to have no sense of
taste –

00:23:29.822 --> 00:23:33.556
whatever you give him, he says it’s very
good!”

00:23:33.556 --> 00:23:40.400
What kind of person is he? You keep
him in a palace and he can live like a
king.

00:23:40.623 --> 00:23:44.353
You keep him in the forests and he will
live there.

00:23:45.123 --> 00:23:48.323
You make him sit on a tree, he will
remain sitting on the tree.

00:23:48.355 --> 00:23:54.175
How can he complain when he knows
that Param Chaitanya itself is moving
him from one place to another,

00:23:54.175 --> 00:23:56.442
then to whom can he complain?

00:23:56.938 --> 00:24:03.698
If you hit him, he will say all right
and if you garland him, he will say all
right.

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:10.881
No difference is to be seen in both the
situations because the Spirit does not
get attached to anything.

00:24:13.222 --> 00:24:19.992
(Inaudible) He can be, in any kind of
crowd or meeting, he will never be
affected as he is satisfied in his Spirit.
When you get stuck on things like

00:24:19.992 --> 00:24:29.099
“my reputation, I am an important
person, I am inferior or I am highly
respected,”

00:24:29.099 --> 00:24:32.819
then you feel, why did they treat me
this way?

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:41.157
But in reality, the one who has become
truly content within does not feel such
things at all.

00:24:41.157 --> 00:24:44.020
He remains content in his own Spirit

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:50.430
He remains content in his own Spirit
– he does not indulge in any
complaints or idle talk.

00:24:51.867 --> 00:24:55.807
When he wants to talk, he talks. When
he doesn’t want to talk, he does not.

00:24:56.317 --> 00:24:58.887
If someone says something, he listens.If
these are words of wisdom,he listens to
it and if they are words of ignorance,
then also he listens to it.

00:24:59.177 --> 00:25:04.917
If these are words of wisdom,

00:25:04.917 --> 00:25:06.734
He knows if it’s ignorance or wisdom.

00:25:06.817 --> 00:25:11.810
Suppose someone asks him, “How are
the people of this community?”

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:17.780
He will simply say, they are all right,
they have these qualities and these
shortcomings.

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:24.426
He will just describe them, but he will
never say “I hate them”,I condemn
them, I despise them. Never.

00:25:24.426 --> 00:25:31.246
He will simply say, they are all right,
they have these qualities and these
shortcomings.

00:25:31.246 --> 00:25:36.320
He will just describe them,

00:25:36.477 --> 00:25:45.157
but he will never say “I hate them”,I
condemn them, I despise them. Never.

00:25:45.157 --> 00:25:49.540
He will never utter such words, because
to hate is a sin,

00:25:49.582 --> 00:25:55.892
and he can never commit a sin.
Whatever he does, will be virtue.

00:25:55.892 --> 00:26:01.108
Try to understand that if he has killed
someone.Now the Devi is there, the
Devi has to kill the Bhoots.

00:26:01.108 --> 00:26:06.053
That is not a sin, She has to kill them.If
she does not kill them, then it is sin.

00:26:06.263 --> 00:26:13.223
So he doesn’t miss out on his work.
What he has to do, he does.

00:26:13.223 --> 00:26:16.180
Because Param Chaitanya is killing.
Who am I to kill?

00:26:17.237 --> 00:26:21.857
If param chaitanya wants to kill
someone, it does.

00:26:22.765 --> 00:26:26.615
If param chaitanya says, do this work,
then I do that.

00:26:26.693 --> 00:26:32.203
However, before invoking the name of
Param Chaitanya,one should at least be
one with the Param Chaitanya.

00:26:32.203 --> 00:26:37.145
Otherwise you blame him for acts done
by you,when he is not sitting in your
pocket, is he?

00:26:37.145 --> 00:26:41.535
If you are in that state, and you have
achieved that higher state

00:26:41.535 --> 00:26:46.242
where you are one with Param
Chaitanya.

00:26:46.458 --> 00:26:52.690
Then only whatever you consider
wrong, you can speak against it.

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:57.104
So many great saints have spoken to so
many people, you are so bad,

00:26:57.104 --> 00:27:00.215
you are so wicked, why do you do like
this.

00:27:00.215 --> 00:27:02.970
They told them everything on their
face, without any fear.

00:27:03.409 --> 00:27:06.639
Because they knew it is the work of
param chaitanya,

00:27:06.639 --> 00:27:08.910
what is there to fear.At the most they
will be jailed for that.

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:12.300
Socrates was poisoned. Did he fear
anyone?

00:27:12.675 --> 00:27:15.545
He said alright make me drink poison or
any other drink.

00:27:15.545 --> 00:27:20.564
You give him any temptation, or do
whatever,what he considers as truth he
will state that only.

00:27:21.127 --> 00:27:23.957
Because Param Chaitanya only will
make him speak that.

00:27:24.693 --> 00:27:30.893
Whenever he has to speak the truth, he
will only speak the truth and he will be
honest about it.

00:27:33.374 --> 00:27:36.264
His intelligence will be able to identify
every truth

00:27:36.464 --> 00:27:38.952
and will be able to recognize who is
true and who is false.

00:27:38.952 --> 00:27:43.279
His intelligence will be very penetrating.
We can call his intelligence wisdom.

00:27:43.279 --> 00:27:46.236
Because his intelligence is enlightened
by the light of the spirit.

00:27:47.156 --> 00:27:53.516
With one glance, he can identify the
level of anyone

00:27:54.212 --> 00:27:59.962
and then Param Chaitanya informs him
how to fix that person.

00:28:00.365 --> 00:28:04.385
Many times, people tell me, you
shouldn’t have said that

00:28:04.385 --> 00:28:09.005
or you shouldn’t have done that but
later when they see the outcome,

00:28:09.005 --> 00:28:12.413
they agree it was good that you said
it.Had you not said that it would not
have happened.

00:28:15.252 --> 00:28:21.042
So, Param Chaitanya does everything
and gains out of it.

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:29.440
We cannot even enjoy its results. Param
chaitanya only enjoys its actions.

00:28:29.912 --> 00:28:32.562
We are only watching the Divine play.

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:40.090
If at all we can enjoy something then it
is only the Divine play of the Spirit.

00:28:40.918 --> 00:28:50.561
Now spirituality is the science of the
Light of the Spirit,its working

00:28:50.561 --> 00:28:55.762
and its Divine play.

00:28:57.548 --> 00:29:04.028
If one truly understands this,

00:29:04.414 --> 00:29:09.104
then he can understand that the
science of this entire creation
emanates from the Spirit

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.540
and till this science becomes a part of
our being,

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:22.120
the outside science is absolutely
useless, because there is very little
science in that

00:29:22.317 --> 00:29:28.067
and it only explains a little about gross
matter.

00:29:28.067 --> 00:29:36.629
There is no balance, no sociability,
no humanity,

00:29:37.144 --> 00:29:42.404
no love, no art, no poetry,

00:29:42.404 --> 00:29:48.692
no respect.There is nothing human in it.
It is like a question.

00:29:52.826 --> 00:29:59.916
To understand all this, to understand
science also, man needs the Light of
the Spirit.

00:30:00.452 --> 00:30:07.432
you can understand all those
extremities of Science that have not
been revealed so far.

00:30:07.432 --> 00:30:11.515
you can understand all those
extremities of Science that have not
been revealed so far.

00:30:11.515 --> 00:30:14.293
On top of that they ask Me, Mother how
do You know? How do I know?

00:30:14.293 --> 00:30:19.038
I don’t. But everything is known(to Me).

00:30:22.107 --> 00:30:29.687
The one who knows everything, it is not
necessary that He reveals everything to
all.

00:30:30.089 --> 00:30:32.739
Because everyone must know how to
understand it also.

00:30:33.753 --> 00:30:38.133
It is not necessary that He goes on
giving sermons to everyone. Let it be
wherever it is.

00:30:38.155 --> 00:30:41.305
When the time comes,then only one
should explain everything.

00:30:41.575 --> 00:30:47.385
Even in Sahaja Yoga, many people get
upset.

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:53.090
My father is not in Sahaja yoga, my
mother,

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:57.466
brother, are not in Sahaja Yoga.Let it be.

00:30:58.209 --> 00:31:04.809
At least you are in Sahaja Yoga. You live
within yourself. Because as much as a
person remains joyful with himself,

00:31:05.226 --> 00:31:09.316
he cannot remain so with anyone else,
because everything is within you.

00:31:10.437 --> 00:31:14.797
To think this(person) is not in it(sahaja
yoga), that(person) is not in it,

00:31:14.797 --> 00:31:19.843
to think like this means that passages
of your heart are still not fully open.

00:31:19.843 --> 00:31:23.890
That’s why we think like that. Those who
are self realised

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:29.519
are your father, brother, sister, they do
not have any such questions.

00:31:31.665 --> 00:31:37.245
This question arises only for those
people who are still half in darkness
and half in light.

00:31:37.245 --> 00:31:42.764
They keep thinking that my brother is
still caught up in this, my sister is
caught up in that.

00:31:44.742 --> 00:31:49.292
They will come into Sahaja Yoga by
themselves. You cannot force anyone.

00:31:49.665 --> 00:31:53.065
A realized Soul thinks like this.

00:31:53.065 --> 00:32:01.670
He keeps watching everyone and
enjoys it.

00:32:02.482 --> 00:32:05.462
He even enjoys the madness of human
beings

00:32:05.462 --> 00:32:08.372
and also enjoys their wisdom.

00:32:09.128 --> 00:32:13.138
If someone speaks foolishly, then also
he enjoys it

00:32:13.138 --> 00:32:16.797
and if someone speaks sensibly, then
too.

00:32:17.448 --> 00:32:21.338
In everything, he sees the source of joy.

00:32:21.881 --> 00:32:26.156
If someone lives in a demented manner,
then also he feels,

00:32:26.156 --> 00:32:32.492
what a drama this is. Like a playwright
writes about a play

00:32:32.694 --> 00:32:37.004
where they show a demented person
or an angry person is shown

00:32:37.697 --> 00:32:40.897
and he becomes a subject of joke.

00:32:41.257 --> 00:32:50.227
So when a Realized Soul watches an
angry person,then what does he think
immediately,

00:32:50.227 --> 00:32:55.817
wow he is really getting angry. Now he
is getting more angry.

00:32:55.817 --> 00:33:01.429
So far it was only at his agnya chakra
but now it has risen to the sahasrara.

00:33:01.429 --> 00:33:05.700
He keeps wondering what will happen
next

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:09.333
– yet he does not worry. He starts to
think,

00:33:09.333 --> 00:33:14.979
the way this person’s temper is rising,
his head might just burst.

00:33:14.979 --> 00:33:18.448
Then he calmly says, lets cool down a
bit and then think.

00:33:18.448 --> 00:33:21.057
The other person says leave it. I
understand him.

00:33:21.057 --> 00:33:24.292
He simply says alright, understand it
then. I too understand you.

00:33:24.292 --> 00:33:27.664
And then, just sitting there, if you ask
him to write a play,

00:33:27.664 --> 00:33:32.650
he will create such a humorous one –
portraying human behaviour so vividly
– that you would be rolling on the floor
laughing.

00:33:33.784 --> 00:33:41.134
His sight is not an entangled vision

00:33:41.959 --> 00:33:46.179
but an unstained and pure sight, or a
witness state.

00:33:46.179 --> 00:33:52.199
With that witness state vision, he
picturises society in such a beautiful
way

00:33:52.199 --> 00:33:57.556
that without laughing you cannot think
of any other reaction and say, what a
beautiful picture has been drawn.

00:33:58.171 --> 00:34:04.011
Even in the most serious situations you
can understand that many things

00:34:04.011 --> 00:34:07.475
which appear grave actually

00:34:07.475 --> 00:34:13.402
carry a big hidden message.

00:34:13.408 --> 00:34:17.878
When we witness war, we naturally feel
very anxious

00:34:17.878 --> 00:34:23.575
and we think, what is happening? Why
are innocent, simple people being
killed?

00:34:23.575 --> 00:34:28.453
But if such an anxious state arises in a
self-realized person,

00:34:28.453 --> 00:34:35.610
then that very feeling is
instantaneously communicated to the
Param Chaitanya and then that tyrant
who commits such acts

00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:39.485
he will be taken to task and given due
suitable treatment.

00:34:40.031 --> 00:34:44.561
That anxiety only manifests in a way.

00:34:44.773 --> 00:34:48.103
If something is delightful, that is
perfectly fine.

00:34:48.103 --> 00:34:51.975
But when something is such that makes
you anxious

00:34:51.975 --> 00:34:56.523
then that makes one wonder, why are
such things are taking place? This
should not happen

00:34:56.523 --> 00:35:01.901
and then immediately, its remedial
action happens. Many such things keep
happening in this manner.

00:35:02.411 --> 00:35:08.921
Like I can tell about myself, when I first
went to Russia

00:35:08.921 --> 00:35:15.423
then after staying there for 7-8 days I
returned home,

00:35:15.423 --> 00:35:19.881
and it came up for discussion that
again I have to go back to Russia for
another Sahaja yoga seminar there.

00:35:19.881 --> 00:35:23.170
At My home everyone said, you just
been there

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:25.925
and again you are going for two or three
days.What’s the point of going again?

00:35:25.925 --> 00:35:28.311
Let it go, there are others who can
handle it.

00:35:28.311 --> 00:35:31.084
But I said: “No, I must go there.

00:35:31.084 --> 00:35:35.001
They asked why? I said, because I have
to break the Eastern Block(countries).

00:35:35.001 --> 00:35:37.506
They asked how will it break? I replied,
“it will just break.”

00:35:37.506 --> 00:35:42.970
People from Eastern Block countries
will come there and when these people
from Eastern Block

00:35:44.599 --> 00:35:52.589
get their Self Realisation and return to
their countries, then the Param
Chaitanya will start working there,

00:35:53.011 --> 00:35:57.561
even if there is only one person from
each of those countries.” The surprising
thing about this is that

00:35:57.561 --> 00:36:01.367
I spoke only for forty-five minutes there
and in the next fifteen minutes,gave
Realization,

00:36:01.367 --> 00:36:05.715
and when these people returned to
their countries, the work got done
there.

00:36:07.105 --> 00:36:13.705
So for the work of Param Chaitanya, it is
necessary that Self-realized people
should be there.

00:36:14.797 --> 00:36:24.957
It is their instrument. The work of Param
Chaitanya gets done through the desire
of Self-realized people.

00:36:25.145 --> 00:36:32.576
If you have a desire, the work can be
done but there should be purity too
in your desire.

00:36:32.576 --> 00:36:39.622
It should not be a desire in which you
are selfish, or a desire in which you
think about yourself only.

00:36:39.622 --> 00:36:47.067
Because this work gets done by the
power of the Spirit. The Atma is our
Shiva,

00:36:47.067 --> 00:36:51.123
who as I have already told you is
absolutely uninhibited, dispassionate,

00:36:52.393 --> 00:37:02.123
formless, unceasing and eternal. It is of
that nature.

00:37:02.717 --> 00:37:11.417
Therefore when a person becomes self
realised, you will find all these qualities
in him.

00:37:11.417 --> 00:37:13.777
If these qualities are not in you, then
like I said

00:37:13.777 --> 00:37:17.980
from the outside you may have all
these covers,

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:22.634
you may be a king or anything but from
within, you are dispassionate,

00:37:23.157 --> 00:37:28.587
detached, you are not attached to
anything.

00:37:28.666 --> 00:37:34.616
From within you do not curse anyone,

00:37:34.818 --> 00:37:41.618
nor do you hanker after anything or
devour anyone. All these six enemies
get detached from within.

00:37:41.706 --> 00:37:47.616
The greatest Light of Spirit is that you
do not have to make any effort.

00:37:48.843 --> 00:37:54.073
They say that keep your mind under
control. There is no need. You do not
have to control anybody.

00:37:54.073 --> 00:37:57.412
As you keep growing deeper in your
Self-realized state,

00:37:57.412 --> 00:38:01.949
the darkness keeps getting eliminated
in that light.

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:07.070
This is a very big gain and whoever has
not gained this benefit,

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:12.805
he should know that his Self realization
has not fully matured.

00:38:12.805 --> 00:38:16.941
If our self realisation has matured
completely,

00:38:16.941 --> 00:38:22.724
then in our lives, in the society around
us, in our Sahaja Yoga community,

00:38:22.724 --> 00:38:30.562
everywhere, a new type of person
should develop,

00:38:30.562 --> 00:38:37.817
who is identified with the Spirit, who is
overwhelmed by the Light of Spirit, in
whom one can have spiritual vision of
Shiva.

00:38:37.984 --> 00:38:43.994
Now you have seen Lord Shiva. When
Shiva got married, his wife

00:38:44.266 --> 00:38:52.736
was the sister of Vishnuji. Vishnuji
himself was Kubera(God of wealth).

00:38:52.946 --> 00:39:00.504
So it was Kubera’s sister whom He(Shri
Shiva) was marrying. He sat on his
Nandi(Shri Shiva’s bull),

00:39:00.504 --> 00:39:06.339
without any reins or anything, just
sitting astride with both legs spread
out

00:39:06.339 --> 00:39:10.550
and Nandi was coming, galloping and
He(Shri Shiva) sitting over it with very
little clothes on Him.

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:17.097
All this is an expression that he had no
perseverance to anything,

00:39:17.097 --> 00:39:20.158
He had no thoughts that “I must have
this.”

00:39:20.158 --> 00:39:26.297
Otherwise, anyone would think, I am
marrying Kubera’s sister, “Which
clothes should I wear?

00:39:27.337 --> 00:39:31.507
In which chariot should I go?” Clothes
would be tailored ten days in advance,

00:39:31.507 --> 00:39:36.631
shoes selected, the whole appearance
prepared, then only He would go for His marriage.

00:39:36.729 --> 00:39:44.819
But Lord Shiva thought, I am getting
married, that’s all I know. He didn’t think
about anything else.

00:39:44.821 --> 00:39:48.531
He didn’t think about anything else.
And those who accompanied him

00:39:48.531 --> 00:39:53.405
were like him, some had only one eye,
some had their limbs deformed,

00:39:53.405 --> 00:39:55.953
yet he took them all along,
unconcerned.

00:39:55.953 --> 00:40:02.495
This symbolically means that when you
have the Light of the Spirit within you

00:40:03.078 --> 00:40:07.738
then you can have any deformity in
your body, anything,

00:40:08.124 --> 00:40:11.104
any type, any kind of funny face,

00:40:11.104 --> 00:40:17.097
but when you have that light, then
Shiva accepts you and takes you along
in His marriage procession.

00:40:17.265 --> 00:40:21.095
Everyone present was surprised,
wondering, what kind of groom is this

00:40:21.168 --> 00:40:24.064
riding on Nandi, legs spread aside on
two sides.

00:40:24.064 --> 00:40:27.723
But he was free spirited, inconsiderate,
and disinterested.

00:40:27.748 --> 00:40:34.248
People must have talked among
themselves, what kind of groom is
coming in this way?

00:40:34.248 --> 00:40:38.497
This was not liked by Shri Parvati,
because she knew

00:40:38.497 --> 00:40:46.504
that Her husband is the embodiment of
the pure spirit. That is why He is called
detached.

00:40:46.504 --> 00:40:54.284
In this two aspects of our own being
are revealed. One is on the outside, is
the Vishnu form

00:40:54.284 --> 00:41:00.101
and within is our Shiva form.

00:41:00.509 --> 00:41:09.849
We have to be like Shiva, free,
disinterested and detached.

00:41:09.849 --> 00:41:14.963
If we become the spirit then any kind of
attachment cannot be within us.

00:41:14.963 --> 00:41:22.139
Then outwardly, you may be Krishna or
anyone,

00:41:22.139 --> 00:41:26.742
but the Shiva within you shall remain
established.

00:41:26.956 --> 00:41:34.466
When you have become the Spirit form,
then the outer form does not remain
important anymore.

00:41:34.466 --> 00:41:40.309
Then your feelings for such things will
change completely.

00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:43.381
Then your feelings for such things will
change completely.

00:41:43.381 --> 00:41:51.192
There is a beautiful example of this
from Shri Eknath ji’s life, He once
carried the ‘kaawad’ ( vessel containing
holy water) all the way to Dwarka

00:41:51.192 --> 00:41:55.463
to offer water there after climbing up
the hill.

00:41:55.463 --> 00:41:59.689
He was deeply immersed in devotion.
Many people had gone along with him,
each carrying their ‘kaawad’ filled with
holy water.

00:42:00.485 --> 00:42:07.525
But there he saw a donkey, dying of
thirst

00:42:07.525 --> 00:42:10.278
and so he made him drink the water,
(which was meant to be offered to the
temple deity).

00:42:10.278 --> 00:42:17.583
People said, what are you doing? You
walked for so long carrying this vessel
filled with holy water and now you have
given it to this donkey?

00:42:18.099 --> 00:42:22.969
Eknath replied, don’t you know that my
Krishna Himself came down to drink
this water.

00:42:22.969 --> 00:42:29.867
Only a Realized Soul can understand
such subtle feelings of bhakti.

00:42:29.867 --> 00:42:33.961
Outwardly to say that we brought the
kaawad

00:42:33.961 --> 00:42:38.802
and we offered it to the deity. Who are
we?

00:42:39.037 --> 00:42:43.827
When this feeling breaks, when the
feeling of I’ness is not there,

00:42:43.827 --> 00:42:48.998
there was this poor thirsty creature
lying there and it was given the water
to drink,

00:42:48.998 --> 00:42:52.166
it’s all right, the Param Chaitanya has
done this work. Who are we in
this(work).

00:42:53.622 --> 00:42:58.282
That is why many things about saints
that we could not understand before,

00:42:58.282 --> 00:43:01.675
you will now be able to understand,
because now you have attained Self-
Realisation.

00:43:01.675 --> 00:43:03.662
You too will perform such deeds.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:08.160
The imprudence we had about these
saints,

00:43:08.367 --> 00:43:12.557
that their lives seemed insane to us
was because we ourselves were insane.

00:43:12.557 --> 00:43:16.572
When you go to a lunatic asylum, even
a sane person appears mad.

00:43:16.676 --> 00:43:21.496
In the same way they(saints) came into
this mad world and tried to make us
understand (the truth),

00:43:21.496 --> 00:43:26.759
but nobody understood them. Instead,
people troubled them and harassed
them

00:43:26.759 --> 00:43:31.256
because they were identified with the
spirit and established in Shiva tatwa, so
they were of the form of Shiva.

00:43:31.256 --> 00:43:37.076
Such a person who is established in
Shiv principle, he may live in whichever
way outwardly, but his Shiva principle

00:43:37.076 --> 00:43:39.953
manifests as light, it glows outside.

00:43:40.395 --> 00:43:46.415
The greatest thing is generosity. This
generosity is the power of Shiva

00:43:46.415 --> 00:43:56.714
Shiva is so generous hearted that he
gives boons even to demons.

00:43:58.408 --> 00:44:01.133
Why? Because He gives the boons.

00:44:01.133 --> 00:44:04.027
Now, some people come to me and ask,
Mother please give us boons.

00:44:04.027 --> 00:44:07.528
I know very well that these people are
very bad, still I say, alright you want
boons, here take it.

00:44:07.528 --> 00:44:13.245
The Param Chaitanya will take care of
them; what do I have to do?

00:44:14.719 --> 00:44:18.119
Even demons were granted boons,
come on you want it, here it is.

00:44:18.119 --> 00:44:21.946
come on you want it, here it is.
Absolutely generous,

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:25.850
what you may call, blind generosity.

00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:29.463
But actually, it is not blind generosity
because there is complete faith that
Param Chaitanya is there,

00:44:29.463 --> 00:44:33.745
it is my power only and it is doing all
the work. I just say, take it.

00:44:33.745 --> 00:44:38.814
After taking it(the boons) from here, on
the way Lord Vishnu ruined
his(demon’s) condition.

00:44:39.685 --> 00:44:45.085
The one who knows everything, for him
there is no concern,

00:44:45.085 --> 00:44:49.102
what will happen to him or what will not
happen. He knows everything.

00:44:49.128 --> 00:44:54.948
Similarly, one who is established in Shiv
principle, he is completely content
within himself.

00:44:55.124 --> 00:45:00.914
He knows everything and understands
everything, but he will not say it.

00:45:01.286 --> 00:45:07.366
He knows everything. And the greatest
power of Shiva is love,

00:45:08.363 --> 00:45:17.693
power of love, in which there is no
expectation of return, no expectation of
return, unconditional love.

00:45:18.846 --> 00:45:26.146
His compassion is so powerful that you
will be surprised to see such compassion.

00:45:26.146 --> 00:45:31.317
Many people say to me, Mother, why
did you help that man? He is such a
bad person;

00:45:31.317 --> 00:45:37.080
he did this and that. Well, what can I
do? He came to me, so it happened –
let it be

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:40.274
Whatever happened, happened, let it
go.

00:45:40.274 --> 00:45:43.797
It is compassion, what else can one do?
Who can stop it?

00:45:43.797 --> 00:45:48.442
When the whole body is filled with
compassion, then whoever comes near,

00:45:48.442 --> 00:45:53.375
this body will act through its
compassion. This body will not give up.
What can be done?

00:45:53.375 --> 00:45:58.838
Similarly, in a Self-realized person, the
power of compassion grows

00:45:59.178 --> 00:46:05.478
and it is so addictive that one does not
enjoy it alone. His very nature becomes
like this, that he becomes extremely
powerful.

00:46:05.478 --> 00:46:09.546
Once you become self realised, you
simply cannot sit quietly, no matter
what you do.

00:46:09.546 --> 00:46:13.026
You will feel alright, I have experienced
it – now let ten others drink this nectar,
then only we will enjoy.

00:46:13.026 --> 00:46:18.631
Let’s see, come along make this(man)
self realised, make that man self
realised.

00:46:19.171 --> 00:46:23.247
Let’s see, come along make this(man)
self realised, make that man
self realised.

00:46:23.247 --> 00:46:27.373
He will not face troubles. People will
harass you and speak ill of you.

00:46:27.373 --> 00:46:32.060
But it will not affect you at all, because
you have become

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:35.462
like a brush in the hands of the Divine
Artist, the Param Chaitanya.

00:46:35.462 --> 00:46:39.451
He is not bothered. The artist knows it
all, what am I to do in this.

00:46:39.451 --> 00:46:44.299
I am just watching this picture being
created.

00:46:44.299 --> 00:46:53.795
Similarly, his nature is inherently
detached so that he becomes
immensely powerful.

00:46:53.805 --> 00:47:07.145
His fear and concerns all vanish and he
is able to do this beautiful works in a
very skillfully.

00:47:07.145 --> 00:47:09.087
People are amazed, how he did this.

00:47:09.234 --> 00:47:15.684
And he explains things so beautifully
that if someone has ego,

00:47:15.684 --> 00:47:18.322
he will never go and tell him directly
that you are very egoistic. Never.

00:47:18.322 --> 00:47:23.907
A Self-Realised person will never say
that. Not like some Sahaja Yogis tell
others, you have a Bhoot in you.

00:47:23.907 --> 00:47:30.063
One should not say that. Let me tell you
by an example of this, about Shri
Ramdas Swami.

00:47:30.332 --> 00:47:35.932
Once, Shivaji had a little pride, because
he was building a great fort

00:47:35.932 --> 00:47:38.795
and thousands of people were working
in it. He began to feel egoistically

00:47:38.795 --> 00:47:45.577
that I am sustaining so many people. At
that time Ramdas Swami arrived there,

00:47:45.577 --> 00:47:51.442
he used to appear wherever he was
required. He saw that he(Shivaji) had
become egoistic,

00:47:51.442 --> 00:47:54.454
but he didn’t say anything. Nearby
there was a large rock.

00:47:54.454 --> 00:47:56.414
Ramdas Swami said, break this rock
very slowly.

00:47:56.444 --> 00:48:01.414
As they kept breaking that, it became
smaller and smaller till about the size of
a coconut.

00:48:01.488 --> 00:48:04.748
He(Ramdas Swami) took that in his
hand and banged it on the ground.

00:48:04.748 --> 00:48:08.738
To everyone’s surprise, inside that rock
there was water and within the water
was a frog.

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:14.650
At that moment, Shivaji immediately fell
at the feet of Ramdas Swami’s, realising
that the one who gives life,

00:48:14.650 --> 00:48:20.151
also provides you with water, then who
am I to think that I am the giver? How
he(Ramdas Swami) broke his(Shivaji’s)
ego!

00:48:20.151 --> 00:48:26.005
You will be surprised that even science
says that a frog can survive without air

00:48:26.005 --> 00:48:28.662
as long as it is in water.

00:48:32.014 --> 00:48:35.724
Now if you have to break someone’s
ego,

00:48:35.724 --> 00:48:38.418
you don’t have to tell him that you are
very egoistical.

00:48:39.883 --> 00:48:42.763
You only have to think that he is very
egoistical

00:48:42.763 --> 00:48:46.783
and then the Param Chaitanya will
arrange for that and will itself break his
ego.

00:48:48.444 --> 00:48:54.744
But first of all, a Realized soul has to
think that

00:48:54.774 --> 00:49:00.454
Now, I have surrendered myself to Lord
Shiva, I am surrendered to my Spirit.

00:49:00.538 --> 00:49:05.898
Because of my Spirit only this Param
Chaitanya is doing all this work

00:49:05.898 --> 00:49:11.939
and that is why I am not worried about
anything. Who can be my enemy?

00:49:11.982 --> 00:49:17.612
Who can kill me? I am living in the
supreme being.

00:49:17.612 --> 00:49:21.654
When he is doing everything, then what
am I doing?”

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:30.200
When one has a feeling like this, then
one can say that we have recognized
Shiva within.

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:34.207
We understand our outer being and all
else very well and also our dignity

00:49:34.207 --> 00:49:39.537
but we must recognise this Shiva which
is within us, which is in our innermost
being.

00:49:39.537 --> 00:49:46.914
The one who is the support of our
entire power, which we call as Sat-
Chit-Ananda,

00:49:46.914 --> 00:49:49.980
we should worship that Shiva.

00:49:50.213 --> 00:49:53.253
Eternal Blessings to You all.
