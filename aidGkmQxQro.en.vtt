00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.240
It wasn't just done out of the blue.
It was Her choosing the names,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.120
explaining the meaning,
and that yogi writing it down

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.440
in Marathi or Sanskrit.
Then the translation

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.440
She had to correct also.
She didn't like some of the translations

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.680
that yogi would do.
So, it was very much an evolving process

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.160
of the names—just Her names.
So there's a lot of power in that.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.320
We don't want to alter
or change any of that.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.600
We have a mantra book.
It's been done by Shri Mataji,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.360
blessed by Shri Mataji.
And even things like the chakra chart.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.160
I remember, I would say
it was like 1971 or '72.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.360
I was a little girl.
I was sitting in the back.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.640
There were about 150 people
in the public program,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:00.080
and I was doing my homework on a slate—
we call it a Marathi pati—with chalk.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.360
I was doing my times tables because
my exam for math was the next day.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.240
I was nine or ten years old.
Suddenly, She called my name

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.480
and said, "Give me your slate."
I honestly thought

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.040
She was checking my homework.
I got really nervous, thinking,

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.600
"Oh my God, now the whole 150 of them
are going to know I made a mistake

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.400
in my times table."
So I went with the pati, the slate.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.680
She turned it around to the side
which was blank,

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.600
and She drew a chakra chart.
It was just a triangle with three nadis,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.520
with the little lotus on the top
and the Sushumna in the middle.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.800
Then She showed everybody.
Everybody came closer to look

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.640
at this diagram
of what the subtle system looks like,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.040
because there was no chart.
This was the very early '70s.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.880
I know I was super relieved
that it was not my homework

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.840
She wanted to check.
But there’s a little sweet story there:

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.280
when I gave the slate to Her,
She did look at my times tables.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.000
I was so nervous She was going to
find a mistake.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.640
I don't recall much, but when I went
and sat down in the back,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.040
She had put a little tick mark.
She had actually checked it.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.000
Talk about multitasking!
Here She is drawing the chakra chart,

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.200
and then She checks my homework
and puts a little tick.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.680
It was very intimate.
Soon enough, one of the yogis,

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:51.913
Maureshwar, was inspired
to draw a chakra chart.

00:02:51.913 --> 00:02:53.360
He was an artist, only 12 or 13.
He came to Shri Mataji,

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.200
and of course, She was happy
that he was doing it,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:04.160
but there were many corrections.
The spelling of Muladhara...

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.600
I mean, it went through three or four
corrections before the final

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.840
chakra chart was approved.
Then we had one chakra chart made

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.840
for the whole collective
that had to go everywhere She went.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.560
We had to take it until somebody said,
"It's not working.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.280
There are programs everywhere.
We need more than one chakra chart."

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.840
So, it was very much
organic learning as we went.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.640
Attention was always on Shri Mataji.
Again, with puja specifically,

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.040
I feel like we have to ready ourselves
before any puja.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.400
For us, the puja—
doesn't matter what it's called,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.640
Krishna, Ganesh, whatever—
is an Atma-Paramatma puja.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:55.200
We really have to be ready within us
that today, on this day,

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.200
my Atma is going to connect
to the all-pervading Paramatma.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:10.960
That feeling is Bhakti, it's adoration.
As a poet, you could write poetry on that.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:17.920
Honestly, it's such a deep meaning.
It's that connection that we came here for.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.040
She chose us, right?
We came into Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.880
We were chosen by the Paramatma,
by the All-Pervading, to be Her children.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:34.880
And we need to stand up to it.
We need to keep that as a priority.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.880
It's okay if you forget a little something
in the offering of it,

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.840
because that's an external puja.
I am not saying we should break protocols

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.440
that have been going on,
but I think the inside puja

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:56.720
is a lot more precious,
where you absolutely have to remember

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.400
why you are here, what is your purpose,
and what is this puja about.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.080
It's for you.
These 300 Atmas have to connect to Her,

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.520
the Paramatma.
Once that is okay, things are just...

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.000
the vibrations flow.
I don't even know.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:28.000
I've made so many mistakes in pujas,
in Sakshat pujas, in the offerings.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.600
I can give quick examples.
She came in 1985 to San Diego.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.800
We got married in '84.
I was the first Indian Yogini

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.240
who came from India.
I was only 22,

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.000
with no experience in puja preparation.
Shri Mataji arrived in San Diego,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.720
so I prepared what I thought
should be for puja.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.840
Now, I had a little bit of experience
in India with the grown-ups,

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.400
but I never was doing it all—
like the whole puja preparation.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:09.840
I was too young.
Anyway, I knew that sandalwood

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:16.160
pleases the Divine.
We have this in Marathi called sahan khod.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.680
Sahan is the stone,
and khod is the sandalwood.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.400
You make this fresh sandalwood paste, right?
You put water and you keep rubbing.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.720
So I made a small container of it.
Shri Mataji came and saw

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.240
the puja preparation.
It was only me;

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.120
they were all Americans in the ashram.
No other Indian had been matched

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.760
to an American yet.
She looked at it and said,

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.480
"Is it a sandalwood paste?
How did you make it?"

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.960
I said, "Shri Mataji, with hand."
So She said, "Only this much?"

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.600
I had a little small container.
But then She said,

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:03.440
"Okay, now put it on My feet."
I thought when you put it on the feet,

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.840
we're going to put it
on the top of the feet.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:12.000
But She wanted the whole soles
of the feet rubbed

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.480
with that little sandalwood paste.
I felt so ashamed because it was like

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.960
two teaspoons that I had made.
She has two feet with all the soles

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.800
She wanted covered,
because She said that the sandalwood

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:41.120
absorbs the heat. It's very cooling.
I understood, okay, it's my Nabhi too.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.120
I should have been generous, right?
How long does it take

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:50.080
to make a little bit more paste?
But again, nobody was there to guide me.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.480
There were no aunties, no grown-ups,
no Indians even in Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.160
So, next year,
I made a nice full katori of it.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:04.880
Same thing—that's '86 or '87,
another puja.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.000
She looks at it and She goes,
"Ah, but My feet are not hot."

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.160
When I made the large amount,
She didn't need it.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.240
But when I didn't make enough,
She wanted it for Herself.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.960
That taught me that we don't know anything.
We really don't know anything

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:28.160
with the Divine.
We are human. We are realized humans,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:34.800
but Divinity is Divinity.
You cannot second guess.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:40.240
You cannot think ahead.
You have to let go completely

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:49.200
and do it with joy.
Even when She would say,

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:57.040
"Where is your attention?"
Marathi language is strong,

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:02.480
so we get told this since we are little
by uncles and aunties—

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.240
there's no reaction.
It's like, "Oh yes, where is my attention?"

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.640
and you move on.
You fix yourself so you don't make

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:15.040
that mistake again.
You might make another mistake,

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:19.920
some completely different one,
but there's that relationship.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:25.760
It's a symbiotic relationship.
As much as we needed Her, She needed us.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.200
We are the foundation of Sahaja Yoga.
In America in the '80s,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.040
Sahaja Yoga was not big;
you could count on your fingers and toes

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:46.160
how many yogis were there in '85 or '86.
One cannot exist without the other;

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:51.440
God cannot exist without His devotees
and devotees cannot exist without God.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:58.160
So, we are all in it together.
We should keep that feeling

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:03.520
that all of us are one,
and all of us are wanting

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:09.680
to connect to Her.
So, what protocol can you break?

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:17.600
Like, how much dirt can a little drop
of water collect

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.480
that the ocean cannot clean?
It just doesn't work like that.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:28.000
You can be as polluted as you are,
but in Her presence, by Her grace,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:37.200
it's no more. That is a reality.
In pujas, I have seen sometimes

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:47.040
older yogis correcting newer ones a lot,
which causes a reaction or fear in them

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.160
because they feel,
"Oh, I broke some protocol."

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.880
And they did. But if you are open
to the grace of Shri Mataji,

00:10:54.880 --> 00:11:00.240
if your heart is clean,
there is no mistake you can make.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:06.000
I am not saying don't follow protocol.
Absolutely, there were certain protocols

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.560
that She Herself wanted.
She made it easy for us by telling us,

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.960
for example, don't draw swastikas
the other way—it's a Hitler sign,

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:19.600
it's evil, it's negative.
She told us all these things,

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:24.000
so don't make such mistakes.
But be a little fluid.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:32.000
There's no need for left Vishuddhi
because something is missing.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.600
The reason I say that is because
all the years that I was attending

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:50.160
to Shri Mataji, it was extremely fluid.
There was no recipe or prescription

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:58.640
for doing anything a particular way.
She was not that; She was so much more

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:03.040
and beyond that.
As long as the vibrations were flowing,

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.840
as long as your Atma was open to Her...
you absolutely had to open

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.520
yourself to Her.
Like you're facing the sun and the flower

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:18.240
has to face the sun to receive the rays.
The flower just has to be open,

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:23.040
face the sun, and receive.
Then things work out.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.760
The flower blooms.
It doesn't have to do anything.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:31.280
It just has to open itself
to the grace of the Divine,

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.200
and it is going to blossom.
Nothing can stop it.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.760
I don't know if any of this
helps with the questions.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.920
I've heard there are some questions
which I can answer the best I can,

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:52.640
but I cannot say that every puja
was the same way,

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:59.440
because She would switch things up.
In the pujas in the '80s and '90s—

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:11.440
mostly '90s—She would just look
and direct you with just a look.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:18.000
So, even though all the trays were ready
and we were decorating the feet,

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:25.280
She would put her hand out.
I am decorating Her feet,

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.920
but She wanted bangles put on
at the same time.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:33.600
You cannot do that physically.
So, you did what She said.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.800
You just finish whatever you were doing,
go put the bangles on,

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.720
go back, and decorate.
It was absolutely fluid.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:47.680
Even though there was some structure,
you had to do what She wanted.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:52.160
You just had to pay attention to Her,
no matter what was going on around you.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:19.280
It felt so natural. It wasn't ritual.
It was just this play between the Divine

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.840
and the few humans
that were on the stage.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.640
In that context, I would like to share
some joyful stories.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:35.120
Krishna Puja in the mid-90s—
I want to say it's 1997,

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:43.760
but I am not 100% sure which year.
The Americas used to host

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:47.600
Krishna Puja in Cabella.
We were there as hosting countries:

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:57.419
Canada, South America, North America.
This puja, Anand Murdeshwar—

00:14:57.419 --> 00:15:02.480
an amazing flautist, as you know—
would come every year

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.880
for Krishna Puja.
The puja is going on.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.760
Shri Mataji is on stage.
The Devi Puja is going on,

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.760
so the ladies are holding the sari,
and there are two ladies

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:16.800
decorating the feet.
With me was a Sahaja Yogini

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.520
from South America.
She didn't speak English, and she was

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.920
the one the country chose
to decorate Shri Mataji's feet.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.960
So, we both are on the stage.
We met at the feet.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.120
I didn't know who she was;
we didn't know each other,

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.840
not even names.
Somebody must have told her,

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.200
"Just follow her."
So we were on the stage

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:40.560
decorating the feet.
This has never happened to me

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:45.040
in prior pujas or pujas after,
but this particular puja,

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:53.280
the music and bhajans were amazing,
and Shri Mataji was absolutely

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:57.440
enjoying the music.
In that enjoyment,

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:03.200
and in Her form of Shri Krishna,
She was moving Her feet.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.320
Like when you keep tal (rhythm).
She wasn't doing it with Her hand,

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:12.480
but She was moving Her feet.
Her feet were vibrating;

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.040
She wasn't lifting them off,
but they were moving.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.600
Now we have to draw the swastikas
on moving feet.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.120
This lady, it's the first time
she's looking at me, like,

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:28.080
"How should we hold the feet?"
I said, "No, no."

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:34.240
She didn't know; she was brand new.
I said, "No, we just have to decorate

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:40.400
the feet while they're dancing, really."
So, again, She's not lifting them

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.960
off the ground,
but they're definitely moving.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:48.480
This had never happened before.
She would always keep Her feet

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:58.720
very still while we were decorating them,
bending over to correct us.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:20.240
This one, now the feet are moving,
so we had to decorate

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.880
like catching the wave.
When it's a little still,

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.120
you make a line.
Then you make another line.

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.560
So, it's not a straight line, right?
It's choppy.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.120
Anyway, the swastikas are done,
and the joy pours.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:40.480
She was thoroughly enjoying it.
Whenever there was a high note,

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.960
the feet went a little bit higher,
like the heels were up.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.360
We were trying to make the swastikas
look good,

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:56.560
so they match in the photograph.
It was a very beautiful moment.

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:01.280
She was enjoying us.
Her feet were dancing

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:14.160
in a vibrating way.
For me, it felt like I was in Gokul

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.880
with Shri Krishna dancing.
He's like, "You want to paint my feet?

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:22.400
Try it. Let's see if you can do it."
That kind of mischief.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.080
I hope you guys feel the vibrations
of this moment

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:31.440
because it was so precious that She was
in that element of Shri Krishna.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.760
After the beautiful puja,
lots of vibrations,

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.560
the heart was bursting with joy
because of Her joy.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:53.360
Then we go to the castle.
Everybody leaves, the hubbub dies down.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:58.400
She changes from the puja sari
to the sari She wears at night

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:03.440
to go to sleep.
That's when She saw Her feet.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.880
She looked at them, and literally,
they looked like a kid

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:10.160
had drawn a swastika.
They did not look like

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.600
nice, smooth swastikas.
So I'm pulling my ears, thinking

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:19.520
she hadn't even looked down earlier.
That's when She saw them.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.000
As soon as She looked down,
She had this big smile,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.040
and She said, "That is Sri Krishna."
It was such a beautiful moment.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:42.945
It reminded you—we already felt it.
The whole Cabella collective said

00:19:42.945 --> 00:19:45.920
after that puja
that it was so powerful and so joyful.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:50.320
The word that kept coming
was "joyful" and "light."

00:19:51.280 --> 00:20:01.520
It was a whole different feeling
created by Her joy to be with us.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:25.440
She was enjoying us and the music.
The other story is equally beautiful.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:32.240
This is another year, mid-90s,
on a Saturday.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:36.800
Shri Mataji, after waking up,
was going to meet different people,

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.160
but then She had a little bit
of free time.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:47.280
Puja was on Sunday, Krishna Puja.
She came out

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.880
into the Cabella living room.
There's a balcony

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.880
outside the living room,
so She wanted the doors open

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.160
and She came out.
She's standing in the balcony

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:03.200
looking down.
It's many levels, right?

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:08.080
Seven floors or whatever.
She's looking down

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.280
at all this hubbub of activity.
The children are playing,

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:17.200
the groceries are coming,
and She's watching all that happening

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:22.080
from way up there.
Nobody looks up; they are all

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:28.000
going to the kitchen or doing their job.
So She stood there, watching everybody,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:44.080
and She looked very pleased.
She comes inside the living room

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:48.480
and said,
"See what's going on downstairs."

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:54.240
I could tell from Her body language
that She was pleased with something.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:02.400
So I go all the way down to the kitchen,
which is in the basement.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:06.320
Next to the kitchen is the dining room.
As I'm coming down,

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:10.400
I start hearing music.
When I go to the dining room,

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:20.800
it was a very surreal feeling.
There were about 80 or 90 yogis.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:29.120
Since Krishna Puja was the next day
and we were the hosting countries,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.560
one of the things we did on Saturday
was have fresh butter ready.

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:41.120
In Italy, you buy this Italian cream
in glass bottles.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:51.040
You buy maybe 100 or 200 bottles
because each bottle makes only about

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:55.200
one tablespoon of butter.
You needed to fill that handi,

00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:01.600
the whole butter pot.
The way you did it was

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.120
by shaking the bottles
so that the butter would separate

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:12.640
from the whey.
So now you have to shake by hand.

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:17.280
It takes 20 to 25 minutes
to make one tablespoon of butter

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:20.480
by shaking the bottle.
We used to always co-opt people,

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:24.640
asking whoever is around in the castle,
"Come, please help us make butter."

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:29.520
This day, there were probably
30 countries represented—

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:39.680
people who had just come to meditate
were grabbed to help.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.040
So now everybody is gathered
around the dining table,

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:46.160
sitting, standing,
and they're shaking the butter.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.240
They all have two bottles,
one in each hand.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:53.520
This Romanian Yogini who had
a beautiful voice started singing.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:57.920
As she's singing,
they're shaking the butter.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:04.560
You should feel the vibrations of this:
30 countries making butter

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:09.600
for Shri Krishna Puja.
There were no instruments, no tabla,

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:14.640
nothing fancy—just bangles.
The bangles are going jing, jing, jing,

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:20.157
and the lady was singing,
and people were matching the sound

00:24:20.157 --> 00:24:24.960
of their bangles to the singing.
That became an instrument.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:32.000
It was magical.
I was watching and, again,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:42.000
that feeling of "This is Gokul."
No language, but she was singing

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.560
simple songs that everybody could sing.
She was the main singer,

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:50.560
and everybody was the chorus.
The cooking happening in the kitchen

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.760
stopped.
They could feel the vibrations

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.880
automatically,
so they all came and joined.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:03.440
Now we have 100-plus yogis
around the dining table

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:08.640
shaking for 30 minutes,
singing beautifully.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:19.040
After seeing that, I came up.
In the meantime, while I was gone,

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.800
She went and changed.
One of the duties of anyone

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.240
attending to Shri Mataji
was that She would give instructions—

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.560
"I want to wear this sari for Puja,"
or "I want to wear this

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:33.200
for the entertainment night."
You were the one preparing everything,

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:40.960
and if She changed Her mind last minute,
you were there to immediately change

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:46.400
or press the sari.
Nothing was laid out;

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:50.480
She was not "ready"
for anything specific.

00:25:53.040 --> 00:26:00.080
But while this was happening downstairs,
She went and changed into a beautiful

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:04.560
Chanderi sari in a Gujarati style—
the style of Radha—on Her own.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:08.560
This was not very often; She went,
opened the cupboard, got Her sari out,

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.320
changed completely,
and became Shri Radha.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:25.440
When I came up, She was dressed
in what looked almost like a Puja sari.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:44.560
She was sitting reclined
on that white couch in the living room,

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:52.240
Her eyes almost closed but with
this beautiful smile on Her face.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.520
I walked in and realized
I had to be very quiet.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.520
I kind of hid behind because I saw
She had changed

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:11.360
and was enjoying the vibrations.
After some time, She said,

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:18.800
"Huh, Puja is done."
Here we were, and the backdrop

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.360
wasn't even up
because the Puja was Sunday.

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:26.720
Poor Dave and the group were on
the Puja stage preparing for Sunday.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:32.560
But She said, "Puja is done."
I was surprised.

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:42.240
She was just so happy and said,
"See, it's the right day for Puja

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.960
because it's Shaniwar."
Shaniwar in Marathi is Saturday—

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:49.440
Shani is Saturn,
the planet of Vishuddhi.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:58.400
The Puja was on the right day.
What set it off was these hundred yogis—

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:08.160
their joyful, spontaneous,
collective love for Shri Mataji.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.560
It was collectivity
with 30 or 40 countries.

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:15.680
It was absolutely joyful,
it literally drew people in

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:21.200
from the kitchen,
and it was totally spontaneous.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:30.960
The Puja had happened in essence.
I remember the following year,

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:36.240
I kind of sheepishly asked Shri Mataji,
"This year, would You like to have Puja

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:40.240
on Saturday instead of Sunday?"
Now I'm thinking, wow,

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:44.000
it should be on Saturday.
She said, "No, no, no.

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:52.400
The musicians are coming to perform
on Saturday evening,

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.840
and it's convenient for the yogis
to have it on Sunday."

00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:02.800
So, that never came up again.
It was always on Sundays.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:13.760
This is a beautiful story
of how Pujas were very alive.

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:20.160
It was a living process, not a ritual.
It was a symbiotic play between

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:28.000
the Divine and us realized souls.
We were all one,

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:35.680
She taking us all under Her pallu
(protection) and moving us along

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:40.960
to the next level in our evolution.
That was the goal of Puja:

00:29:40.960 --> 00:30:01.360
to make us go deeper and grow within.
So, if people have questions, honestly,

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.440
just surrender the questions
to Shri Mataji.

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:09.600
You will find your answers.
I really want you all to feel

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:15.840
what a joy every Puja was.
I know some Pujas were tough,

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:25.040
like Guru Pujas, where She was strict.
But there was a big change inside

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:29.040
that would happen for each Puja,
and you felt it.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:33.680
Every Puja was a growth.
Thank you so much, everybody.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.468
Thank you.
Jai Shri Mataji.
