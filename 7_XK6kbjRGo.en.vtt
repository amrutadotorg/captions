03:27.127 --> 03:35.866
Today we have gathered here to do
the Sahastrara puja.

03:36.858 --> 03:44.038
Sahastrar, the word ‘sahastr’, in Sanskrit
language, means ‘one thousand’.

03:44.239 --> 03:54.700
And there are one thousand petals
in our brain, which get enlightened.

03:54.901 --> 04:01.345
Of course, the doctors are quarrelling
on that point, but forget about them.

04:01.639 --> 04:09.518
Now these petals are kept ready
for our enlightenment,

04:10.424 --> 04:18.479
and these are really the nerves,
one thousand nerves,

04:18.680 --> 04:24.090
which are there for the enlightenment
of the brain.

04:24.598 --> 04:35.807
So when the Kundalini rises, she enlightens
those one thousand nerves

04:36.008 --> 04:45.100
which become like a –

04:45.301 --> 04:57.601
as you see here, the shape of these
flames – like a petal.

04:58.426 --> 05:08.096
And that’s why it is called as ‘Sahastrara’
- is the centre of Sahastrara.

05:08.297 --> 05:16.085
In the human beings it is a very important
centre,

05:16.286 --> 05:23.580
because this is the only centre by which
we think

05:23.781 --> 05:31.679
and we try to stop whatever we don’t like.

05:32.473 --> 05:40.143
This is the centre which reacts, reacts
in such a manner

05:40.344 --> 05:48.182
that, without any discretion we start
saying, ‘no’ to this, and, ‘no’ to that,

05:48.383 --> 05:53.664
on small things also. Like somebody might
say, “I don’t like this carpet,”

05:53.865 --> 05:58.661
“I don’t like this house,” “I don’t
like that.”

06:01.939 --> 06:07.953
This language itself shows that – who
are you? First find out!

06:08.154 --> 06:12.868
But you cannot become yourself unless
and until this Sahastrara,

06:13.069 --> 06:21.947
this brain is opened out and the Kundalini
becomes one with the Paramchaitanya.

06:23.979 --> 06:33.116
Before that, you are in complete ignorance
about what is good and what is bad.

06:33.317 --> 06:39.384
Whatever you think [that], for this brain,
is good, you do it.

06:39.585 --> 06:44.242
But whatever is really good, you do
not know,

06:44.443 --> 06:48.625
because you do not know the Reality.

06:49.657 --> 06:54.340
Now we have to understand the consciousness
that we have:

06:54.541 --> 07:01.134
consciousness of being alive, consciousness
of so many things we have,

07:01.335 --> 07:06.788
and the so-called knowledge we have
about everything.

07:07.367 --> 07:14.209
All that consciousness is stored near
the liver – for your information –

07:14.455 --> 07:17.386
by this diaphragm.

07:17.587 --> 07:23.113
But then, this consciousness starts rising,
higher and higher.

07:23.314 --> 07:27.846
Then you become aware. In the evolutionary
process,

07:28.047 --> 07:33.100
you become aware, aware of things.

07:33.301 --> 07:40.639
Without going through your brain, you just
become aware. And how?

07:40.840 --> 07:46.634
Not by thinking, not by understanding
or seeing,

07:46.835 --> 07:52.932
but you become aware because
your brain has now

07:53.133 --> 08:00.366
started working in a manner that’s very,
very sensitive.

08:00.567 --> 08:06.377
So you just become aware of some sort
of a fear,

08:06.578 --> 08:13.114
or maybe some sort of a goodness
or anything. But it goes even further.

08:13.353 --> 08:18.534
The growth of consciousness, which becomes
aware, goes further:

08:18.735 --> 08:28.747
where you start liking a person,
or disliking a person.

08:30.518 --> 08:35.786
But, still it’s nothing definite and sure.

08:35.987 --> 08:40.422
You dislike a person because he has
a particular type of a face,

08:40.623 --> 08:44.381
maybe eyes or maybe anything.

08:45.354 --> 08:52.410
Or maybe because you have known
somebody who has been very nice,

08:52.611 --> 08:58.738
so you start transferring that image
onto others.

08:58.939 --> 09:06.985
With these transferred images, you can
hate or love someone.

09:07.186 --> 09:12.888
Then you start saying, “I hate this,
I hate that,”

09:13.440 --> 09:18.138
which has no, actually, substantial
meaning.

09:18.339 --> 09:26.866
You hate it because, perhaps, maybe such
and such person looks like somebody.

09:27.223 --> 09:31.285
Now you go further with it, then you see
that, such and such person –

09:31.486 --> 09:35.133
now I’m not talking about things, but
about persons -

09:35.334 --> 09:42.946
such and such person has done this harm to me
- something positive (may mean "negative").

09:43.147 --> 09:49.295
So you start feeling that you should hate
that person.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.646
Now you start hating that person.
With that hatred

09:53.847 --> 09:58.261
you develop new faculties [of] how to harm
that person.

09:58.462 --> 10:02.708
Then you start thinking how to destroy
that person,

10:02.909 --> 10:08.288
how to make his life miserable.

10:08.489 --> 10:14.219
Then you may beat that person, you may
shout at that person,

10:14.420 --> 10:18.497
you may try to kill that person. You can
do anything.

10:18.698 --> 10:24.071
So now the awareness is going towards
another direction, which is darkness,

10:24.272 --> 10:29.907
which is not light, because in the light
you won’t do such a thing.

10:30.108 --> 10:35.985
In the light you see everybody, everybody
is sitting, you know how far you are,

10:36.186 --> 10:41.227
where you are sitting. If you want to go
out, you know how to walk out.

10:41.428 --> 10:46.238
But when, in the darkness you are there,
you just don’t understand

10:46.439 --> 10:54.178
and you go on behaving in a manner
which is, which cannot be explained

10:54.379 --> 10:58.581
otherwise, except that, because you are
a human being.

10:58.782 --> 11:03.829
Animals don’t do like that. Animals have
limitation [on them].

11:04.030 --> 11:10.820
The animals, if they find something wrong,
something absolutely

11:11.027 --> 11:15.962
harmful done to them, then they will attack
or run away,

11:16.163 --> 11:21.184
but they do not carry a kind of a hatred
or anything.

11:21.385 --> 11:25.907
But they can carry the impression of fear,
could be,

11:26.108 --> 11:32.179
of some sort of a harm done to them.
But human beings are not like that.

11:32.380 --> 11:41.728
Human beings don’t have any particular
reason, as such, to hate someone.

11:41.929 --> 11:48.664
But why it works out? Because they are
involved in their ego.

11:48.865 --> 11:58.208
Egoistical person feels that he has a right
to do what he wants to do:

11:58.441 --> 12:05.246
he can kill anybody, he can bomb anyone,
he can do whatever he likes.

12:06.135 --> 12:11.647
But a person who is not doing that,
is the other way round:

12:11.848 --> 12:16.689
he is frightened, he is afraid of someone.

12:16.890 --> 12:21.684
Now the awareness moves on. This is
a subtler awareness,

12:21.885 --> 12:28.730
because, if you are afraid of somebody,
you would not like to go to his house,

12:28.931 --> 12:34.409
you will avoid him in the street,
all things you can do.

12:34.610 --> 12:39.111
So all this kind of knowledge about other
human beings also

12:39.312 --> 12:42.788
accumulates in your mind.

12:42.989 --> 12:52.139
Then this thing starts working on
a collective level,

12:52.340 --> 12:56.801
because you think, “This group is very bad.
They are good.

12:57.002 --> 13:01.825
These are bad. They are excellent!”
like that, it works out.

13:02.026 --> 13:08.761
In your own mind you think that somebody
has a group,

13:08.962 --> 13:13.318
and the other group is better or that group
is better.

13:13.519 --> 13:23.379
And collectively, then, you start working
out your whole temperament, your awareness.

13:23.580 --> 13:27.623
Like once people decide that say,
for example,

13:27.824 --> 13:35.642
that black people are to be finished,
so all the white people can join together.

13:35.843 --> 13:43.827
Or like at the time of Hitler, he decided
that all other human beings but Germans

13:44.028 --> 13:49.229
were useless. So he gathered people around
his thought and ideas.

13:49.430 --> 13:54.350
And this collective awareness just
comes to,

13:54.551 --> 13:58.569
I don’t know how, but it enters into
the minds of many.

13:58.770 --> 14:04.219
They never challenge it, they never ask
[about] it, whether it is correct or not.

14:04.420 --> 14:11.045
So this grows more and more and more,
and then it becomes like a –

14:11.642 --> 14:17.718
country-wise, you can say – an awareness
of this kind of a feeling.

14:17.919 --> 14:27.461
But whether it is correct or not is not
understood, is not known.

14:27.662 --> 14:33.105
So, what is important [is] that you should
know Reality,

14:33.306 --> 14:37.926
you should know exactly what is right
and what is wrong.

14:38.127 --> 14:48.063
For that, as I told you, there is this
great power of Kundalini within you.

14:48.618 --> 14:51.752
She is the one, She passes through
all these centres,

14:51.953 --> 14:58.198
enlightens them first of all, so your
awareness gets enlightened.

14:58.399 --> 15:03.843
And when She pierces through Sahastrara,
She joins you

15:04.044 --> 15:12.319
to this All-pervading Power which is
Knowledge,

15:13.612 --> 15:20.444
which is love, which is Truth.

15:21.890 --> 15:26.252
So, after that, you immediately know –

15:26.909 --> 15:31.074
some people don’t know immediately,
but some people do –

15:31.275 --> 15:40.074
that what we have been thinking so far,
of separating ourselves from others

15:40.275 --> 15:44.227
by thinking they are not all right, they are
wrong, they are whatever it is –

15:44.428 --> 15:48.505
this disappears. This disappears
completely,

15:48.706 --> 15:52.458
and then you realise that your awareness
itself,

15:52.664 --> 15:58.095
awareness itself is dominated by so many
other circumstances.

15:58.296 --> 16:02.302
For example, where you were born, what
your parents taught you,

16:02.503 --> 16:05.399
what experiences you have had.

16:05.600 --> 16:10.628
And then you realise that it was all wrong,
because it’s not Reality.

16:10.829 --> 16:16.124
Whatever feelings you have, whatever
ideas you have

16:16.325 --> 16:23.584
about another person or about other nation,
all of them are not correct.

16:23.785 --> 16:31.642
Because now your Sahastrara is awakened,
that it is connected now

16:31.843 --> 16:38.328
to the All-pervading Power. So this
starts flowing into you.

16:38.529 --> 16:47.579
This - I should say - enlightened awareness,
it starts flowing down into your being,

16:47.780 --> 16:55.819
in your brain, and then on your nerves
you can feel that awareness.

16:56.020 --> 17:02.197
Now once you want to know about something,
whether it is right or wrong –

17:02.398 --> 17:06.015
absolute right and wrong, it’s not [a]
question of relative –

17:06.216 --> 17:11.069
you just have to put your hands towards
that person,

17:11.270 --> 17:14.259
or towards that thing or whatever it is:

17:14.460 --> 17:19.039
immediately on these vibrations you
will know.

17:19.240 --> 17:23.967
So what are these vibrations, is this
Paramachaitanya,

17:24.168 --> 17:31.054
we call it ‘Brahmachaitanya’, which starts
flowing through your finger tips.

17:31.260 --> 17:36.194
Now you start feeling what chakras
they are catching,

17:36.395 --> 17:43.658
whether they are right or wrong, and your
discretion improves immensely.

17:43.859 --> 17:47.581
The brain, which was putting you
in delusions

17:47.782 --> 17:52.444
and wrong type of life, immediately
corrects itself.

17:52.645 --> 17:58.132
For example, I’m walking in a place
with my eyes closed,

17:58.333 --> 18:05.017
and there is a big ditch. I can’t see it,
I’m just walking.

18:05.218 --> 18:08.461
And suddenly I open my eyes and see
the ditch:

18:08.662 --> 18:12.587
immediately I know it’s wrong and I give up
and come away.

18:12.788 --> 18:18.618
In the same way it happens to you when
your Sahastrara is enlightened.

18:18.819 --> 18:24.675
Whatever you had gathered, knowledge,
whatever you think was right,

18:24.876 --> 18:30.325
whatever was your dream and your aims
of life, all these aspirations,

18:30.526 --> 18:33.055
they melt away.

18:33.256 --> 18:40.187
And then you take to reality and you start
seeing the reality of everything.

18:40.388 --> 18:48.785
Unless and until you see that reality, you
will be going with [the] other crowd:

18:48.986 --> 18:51.315
“These people are saying so, so let’s
do that.”

18:51.516 --> 18:56.810
“They are saying so, so let’s do that”.
But you cannot see whether it is correct

18:57.011 --> 19:03.117
or not, it’s good for you or not, or
whether it is going to help you.

19:03.318 --> 19:09.311
This kind of thing is so common
in the whole world

19:09.512 --> 19:16.208
and that’s why there is so much problem.
Because they don’t know the reality.

19:16.409 --> 19:21.013
Once you know the reality, most of
the problems can be finished,

19:21.214 --> 19:25.012
because this brain itself is creating
problems.

19:25.213 --> 19:31.206
First of all, it commits all kinds
of atrocities, violence, everything;

19:31.407 --> 19:37.342
then it also justifies itself, and then
it does even worse things.

19:37.543 --> 19:44.831
All this, they used to call it as ‘sin’, but
now in Sahaja Yoga, that’s finished now.

19:45.053 --> 19:49.854
Whatever your brain was contaminated with
is now cleansed.

19:50.055 --> 19:54.648
It has got the knowledge and through
the knowledge you can make out

19:54.849 --> 19:59.916
what is right and what is wrong.
Up to this point is all right.

20:00.117 --> 20:08.847
But then you must have full understanding
that, whatever [is] right, is right,

20:09.048 --> 20:15.108
and whatever [is] wrong is wrong, and we
should not do anything that is wrong,

20:15.309 --> 20:21.109
always do the right. You have to decide
on that point.

20:21.310 --> 20:26.435
”Now we have to do the right only,
never the wrong”.

20:26.636 --> 20:31.826
This, when it comes to your mind, then
what starts is your determination:

20:32.027 --> 20:37.606
what we call as devotion, dedication,
surrendering.

20:39.849 --> 20:47.924
With that, you give up all your false ideas
and all your false pride,

20:48.125 --> 20:51.007
all other things that you have been doing
so far,

20:51.208 --> 20:57.396
and immediately you become a different
person, a beautiful person.

21:00.620 --> 21:06.059
Now the third thing that happens to you,
which never happened to you before,

21:06.260 --> 21:13.481
[is] that you feel that: “Unless and until
I give the same state to other people

21:13.682 --> 21:19.970
it won’t be all right, it won’t be -
all right for me to talk to them”.

21:20.171 --> 21:23.508
So you start talking to your brothers,
sisters.

21:23.709 --> 21:28.378
Then you start talking to other people,
then you start talking to...

21:28.579 --> 21:32.172
[the] whole nation you can talk about
Sahaja Yoga,

21:32.373 --> 21:39.697
that, “I have gained so much, I have got
these things; so now, why not you take it?”

21:39.898 --> 21:43.417
But to expect that by talking,
by discussion,

21:43.618 --> 21:48.131
by arguments, by sermoning…
they will never take.

21:48.332 --> 21:56.039
Because their brain, as I told you, is just
the same - still full of ignorance.

21:56.240 --> 21:59.891
So what you have to do is to raise
their Kundalini.

22:00.092 --> 22:04.996
Once you raise their Kundalini and their
brain opens,

22:05.197 --> 22:11.190
then they are on the same line as yourself.
They don’t have to worry

22:11.391 --> 22:19.581
about what is good and what is bad,
they know [it] themselves.

22:22.400 --> 22:29.176
Now that is what is very important.
To correct this world is very important:

22:29.377 --> 22:33.708
that you all should know what is right
and what is wrong.

22:33.909 --> 22:41.248
And you have a vehicle of Paramachaitanya
to know what is wrong and what is right.

22:41.449 --> 22:46.272
Now this strength starts moving and,
as you see, there are

22:46.473 --> 22:51.047
so many people, today, with their open
Sahastrara.

22:51.248 --> 22:57.715
So opening Sahastrara was the most
important part of the evolutionary process.

22:57.916 --> 23:03.080
All the evolution process brought human
beings to what level?

23:03.299 --> 23:11.130
We had wars, we had all kinds of silly
programmes

23:11.376 --> 23:17.906
by which we really ruined so many
countries, so many people.

23:18.649 --> 23:26.629
Now when you are one with that
All-pervading Power: It’s a pure power.

23:26.830 --> 23:32.675
It’s a nirmal power. Absolutely pure
power.

23:32.876 --> 23:38.662
That gives you complete sense and complete
understanding

23:38.863 --> 23:46.842
as to how you should move, how you should
live, and what you should have.

23:47.179 --> 23:51.759
This is what is Self-realisation, they say.

23:51.960 --> 23:57.940
But I would say that Self-realisation is
much further than that.

23:58.141 --> 24:05.269
Even if your brain is enriched by
the Knowledge, the Real Knowledge,

24:05.470 --> 24:09.678
still there are other things which you
should have.

24:09.879 --> 24:15.854
And the most important thing is that
you have to be

24:16.055 --> 24:21.536
completely aware – again I say word
‘aware’ –

24:21.737 --> 24:31.206
of where you stand in this big plan
of world global transformation.

24:31.407 --> 24:35.927
What is your position? What are you
supposed to do

24:36.128 --> 24:42.750
for this global transformation? What is
your position?

24:42.964 --> 24:49.644
Where do you stand? What is the work
for you to be done?

24:49.845 --> 24:57.725
Now you’ve got this compulsion on you,
that, “I have to do something.”

24:57.926 --> 25:03.918
When this compulsion starts working
on you, which is not dreadful,

25:04.119 --> 25:11.609
which is not annoying, but very peaceful
and joyful,

25:11.810 --> 25:17.747
which says that, “I have to see that others
also know themselves!”

25:17.948 --> 25:24.019
So to know themselves is, first of all
you must know your own chakras.

25:24.694 --> 25:30.047
Yes, many people get their Realisation,
I know, very quickly.

25:30.248 --> 25:34.408
But they do not settle down with
their chakras.

25:34.609 --> 25:39.088
They have to see to their chakras: why you
have problems on your chakras.

25:39.289 --> 25:42.961
They will know they have problems,
but they still go on

25:43.162 --> 25:47.834
without paying attention or without looking
at it.

25:48.035 --> 25:52.369
To them it is a kind of a

25:55.136 --> 26:01.000
by the way [style], you can say: that,
“These problems are with me doesn’t matter.

26:01.201 --> 26:08.279
But what does it matter as long as I am
working out Sahaja Yoga?”

26:08.465 --> 26:12.918
It is not only for others, but for yourself
also!

26:13.119 --> 26:18.152
Is important that you should get your
chakras corrected.

26:18.353 --> 26:23.516
That’s the most important thing for you,
and then you will have Self-knowledge,

26:23.717 --> 26:27.643
in the sense [that] you will know what is
the defect, where is the defect,

26:27.844 --> 26:34.040
”What am I doing wrong? What should I do?”
And then when you correct it,

26:34.241 --> 26:38.434
when you correct those centres, then
your awareness,

26:38.635 --> 26:43.359
I would say, will be really, fully
enlightened about all the world.

26:43.560 --> 26:46.917
Now, it’s a tremendous thing – it’s very
tremendous.

26:47.118 --> 26:52.590
Because if you have to transform this mad
world into something very sane,

26:52.791 --> 26:57.121
and if we have to give them all
Self-realisation,

26:57.322 --> 27:03.227
imagine the task, how great it is, how many
people we need to do it.

27:03.404 --> 27:11.012
But if your willpower is strong about it
and you see – you feel compelled to do it.

27:11.213 --> 27:16.144
But normally, you see, we are compelled
because we have to run our houses,

27:16.345 --> 27:20.797
we have to earn money, we have to do this,
we have to do that.

27:20.998 --> 27:28.241
That you can do. But main object of your
life is to transform people

27:28.450 --> 27:36.266
and to work it out, this transformation –
for the global peace.

27:36.467 --> 27:40.403
I don’t know [if] it has been predicted
or not,

27:40.604 --> 27:43.703
that a complete transformation will take
place,

27:43.904 --> 27:48.503
but they have talked about transformation.
I don’t know that part,

27:48.704 --> 27:55.025
and I just don’t bother my head as to how
many people are getting transformed.

27:55.226 --> 28:00.420
But after transformation you must settle
down.

28:00.621 --> 28:05.572
First of all you should see if you are
a peaceful person,

28:05.732 --> 28:10.393
if there’s peace in your heart.
If you have no peace in your heart

28:10.594 --> 28:15.407
then you are not a Sahaja Yogi.
If you get excited

28:15.608 --> 28:22.115
and if you start shouting at people and all
that, it means you are not Sahaja Yogis.

28:22.316 --> 28:28.869
You have to have a very, very peaceful
temperament, that is very important.

28:29.070 --> 28:34.881
Now with that peace what should be there,
[is] pure compassion.

28:36.809 --> 28:42.581
What you are doing is not for your benefit
or as such,

28:42.782 --> 28:52.157
but because you are compelled by this Force
to do good for others, to transform them.

28:52.358 --> 28:57.788
This is the greatest good you can do
to others, that their brains are put right,

28:57.989 --> 29:02.667
they get rid of their diseases, they get
rid of their problems. It’s all there.

29:02.868 --> 29:07.670
But, the first thing and the most important
thing that happens

29:07.871 --> 29:11.327
[is] that they get the power to transform
others.

29:11.528 --> 29:17.703
When you have that power to transform
others you should not waste it,

29:17.904 --> 29:22.601
you should not use it for yourself. That
means the growth is not complete.

29:22.802 --> 29:29.420
You must talk about it, you must tell
about it, and you must work it out.

29:29.621 --> 29:33.194
Wherever it is possible you have to work
it out.

29:33.395 --> 29:38.845
This is the way we can spread people
on a global level,

29:39.046 --> 29:42.369
who can get complete transformation.

29:42.570 --> 29:48.077
All our problems, whether in India
or anywhere,

29:48.278 --> 29:57.184
is because of human beings, because they
have been not enlightened.

29:57.385 --> 30:02.981
See, if you are enlightened you’ll have
no problem of any quarrelling

30:03.182 --> 30:06.629
or any fighting and all that.

30:06.830 --> 30:13.555
If you are enlightened, then you will think
about others,

30:13.756 --> 30:18.968
others as if they are your own, bother
your heads about them.

30:19.169 --> 30:23.705
You will not think about yourself anymore.

30:23.906 --> 30:30.029
If you are enlightened then [there's]
no question of any violence in your head.

30:30.230 --> 30:33.920
Nowadays in the name of religion,
in the name of everything,

30:34.121 --> 30:36.469
there is so much of violence.

30:36.692 --> 30:41.859
This violence can be easily corrected
if they all become Sahaja Yogis.

30:42.060 --> 30:47.319
Think, if all people become Sahaja Yogis,
how will they quarrel, for what?

30:47.520 --> 30:51.382
So this religion is there, but above
all these religions

30:51.583 --> 30:56.288
is the religion of Sahaja Yoga, where
you become one.

30:56.489 --> 31:01.184
And there all these quarrels of religions
will disappear.

31:01.773 --> 31:04.770
This is not the only problem we have
as human beings,

31:04.971 --> 31:08.377
we have some other problems also,
very serious.

31:08.578 --> 31:16.302
That is, we have a hankering.

31:17.033 --> 31:22.789
We are very greedy. We cannot adjust
yourself to any other circumstances.

31:22.990 --> 31:26.958
We want to live in complete comfort and
this and that.

31:27.151 --> 31:32.639
But after this you can sleep anywhere, you
can eat anywhere, you need not eat.

31:32.818 --> 31:42.838
You become a person who is above all these
needs, all these demands, absolutely.

31:56.894 --> 32:02.470
Then you don’t worry, you don’t worry.
There’s worry for what?

32:02.671 --> 32:06.963
Supposing I get lost somewhere and the car
is going in a wrong way:

32:07.164 --> 32:11.527
all right, I have to go that way,
that’s why I’m going like that.

32:11.728 --> 32:14.479
What is there to feel upset about it?

32:14.680 --> 32:21.664
So many things, small, big, happen in your
life for which you get upset.

32:21.865 --> 32:26.324
But now, with this blessing of Sahastrara,

32:26.525 --> 32:32.558
you’ll be amazed, there is help
from Paramchaitanya.

32:32.780 --> 32:41.662
And that means a tremendous help, because
it acts globally, it acts individually,

32:41.863 --> 32:48.770
it acts on communities, it acts on nations,

32:48.971 --> 32:58.019
because there is a Divine – what we call
‘Divine’ – where is a Divine play going on.

32:58.220 --> 33:03.601
And this Divine play plays tremendous
beautiful things,

33:03.802 --> 33:08.085
by which people start correcting
themselves.

33:08.286 --> 33:11.634
So, you should never be nervous, you should
never be upset,

33:11.835 --> 33:16.929
because you have the Divine Power
within you, and it will correct.

33:17.130 --> 33:22.958
It can correct anyone. I mean, recently
we had a case of one boy

33:23.159 --> 33:28.731
who was hit by a truck and they said
his lungs were smashed.

33:28.932 --> 33:33.509
Now, with the lungs smashed, nobody has
heard that they become normal.

33:33.715 --> 33:37.292
Not only they became normal, but he started
breathing normally.

33:37.493 --> 33:43.564
And now he is all right. Is only this work
is done by Paramchaitanya.

33:43.765 --> 33:48.054
You don’t have to do anything. Any problem
comes before you,

33:48.255 --> 33:54.840
before it really touches you, is solved
by the Paramchaitanya.

33:55.602 --> 34:02.621
But you must have full faith in yourself
and in Paramachaitanya

34:02.822 --> 34:08.223
and believe that you are a realised-soul.
Nobody can harm you.

34:08.424 --> 34:12.858
If they try to harm you, for the time
being, all right, you may suffer,

34:13.059 --> 34:18.053
but you don’t also feel the sufferings
and you get out of it.

34:18.254 --> 34:24.655
Such a security, such a proper guidance
is there.

34:24.856 --> 34:28.884
Also you are saved from all kinds
of attacks

34:29.085 --> 34:33.530
and all kinds of mistakes that you commit.

34:33.731 --> 34:41.021
It’s all such a big – I would say,
a Computer of Knowledge.

34:41.222 --> 34:48.077
He knows, It knows what you are doing
and what you should not do,

34:48.278 --> 34:54.012
where you are going and what should
not be your way.

34:54.213 --> 35:00.503
He knows, It knows everything, knows
everything about you.

35:00.704 --> 35:06.048
So then you have to become aware of It.

35:06.249 --> 35:10.693
Now this is the stage where I would say
that you have to be aware

35:10.894 --> 35:18.483
that you are realised-souls, you are
different,

35:18.684 --> 35:24.162
very unique. You are realised-souls,
you are not ordinary people.

35:24.363 --> 35:34.140
And that you are protected by this
Paramchaitanya. Nothing can change you,

35:34.341 --> 35:41.690
nothing can trouble you, nothing can
overpower you.

35:41.891 --> 35:46.953
Because you are not aware, also, of this
Paramachaitanya,

35:47.154 --> 35:50.938
that’s why you, a little bit, get worried.
And people write to me,

35:51.139 --> 35:55.182
“Mother, my - something wrong with
my daughter, something this thing."

35:55.383 --> 36:01.062
Everything can be corrected
by Paramchaitanya,

36:01.263 --> 36:05.312
if you know how to leave it to That,

36:06.129 --> 36:11.265
if you understand how you are one
with that Paramchaitanya,

36:11.466 --> 36:19.722
you are a part and parcel of that. And that
Paramchaitanya is looking after you.

36:19.923 --> 36:24.640
You don’t have [a] very conscious effort,

36:24.841 --> 36:30.659
there’s no need to have very conscious
effort. Accept life as it is.

36:30.860 --> 36:35.064
As it is, whatever life is there, accept.
Don’t retaliate,

36:35.265 --> 36:38.848
don’t get angry, don’t get upset.
Just accept.

36:39.049 --> 36:43.905
And you’ll enjoy the same life which
was irritating you!

36:44.106 --> 36:50.118
You will see the enjoying part of that,
and it will be so beautiful

36:50.319 --> 36:54.675
the way you will see that you’ll get over
all your problems,

36:54.876 --> 36:57.408
you’ll get over all your enemies.

36:57.609 --> 37:04.988
And a kind of a very fresh, beautiful
existence you’ll have.

37:05.189 --> 37:12.310
So now, as you are all Sahaja Yogis,
is a very great position.

37:12.511 --> 37:19.950
With that, if you humble down, humble down,
then you’ll be amazed to see

37:20.151 --> 37:27.259
that, you are absolutely in contact with
this Paramchaitanya;

37:27.460 --> 37:32.086
not only that, but you have become
Paramchaitanya.

37:35.051 --> 37:39.584
With this Paramchaitanya you can do
anything.

37:39.785 --> 37:46.100
I need not tell you what you can do,
because some of you may not believe.

37:46.301 --> 37:52.183
But that’s [what] my own experience is,
that, if you are the Paramchaitanya,

37:52.384 --> 37:57.668
if you know you are the Paramchaitanya,
then it keeps your dignity,

37:57.869 --> 38:04.079
it keeps your position, it keeps your world
and looks after you.

38:04.280 --> 38:09.421
And whatever is just said or desired,
you just get it.

38:09.622 --> 38:15.534
Your desires also change. Your desires
are not for stupid things,

38:15.735 --> 38:20.344
but for something that is very noble.

38:21.400 --> 38:27.353
Like, you want to transform people, you
want to do Sahaja Yoga work.

38:27.560 --> 38:31.598
All these desires are fulfilled fully,

38:31.799 --> 38:37.892
when you want to do it, you like it and
you think of it.

38:38.093 --> 38:42.028
It is something, even seeing something:

38:42.229 --> 38:46.696
if you see something and you are stunned
by that!

38:46.897 --> 38:55.732
Immediately Paramchaitanya will take over
and you will have no problems, no problems.

38:55.933 --> 39:04.178
Because the way we react to all these
difficulties and to so-called odds in life

39:04.379 --> 39:07.602
becomes a play, just a play.
You are amazed!

39:07.803 --> 39:11.979
You looked at it and finished!
Look at that, and finished!

39:12.180 --> 39:19.928
That is how it is the light, which goes into
the darkness and finishes the darkness.

39:20.129 --> 39:24.799
The darkness is finished, and our problems
are finished also.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.552
So this is what is our awareness has
to become.

39:28.753 --> 39:32.383
Awareness has to become Paramachaitanya.

39:32.584 --> 39:37.764
Then you get all the ideas, everything
that are Divine.

39:37.965 --> 39:45.457
But not only that, but also the help of
the Divine, all the solutions of the Divine.

39:45.658 --> 39:50.588
It’s something amazing! And everything
quietens down,

39:50.789 --> 39:57.097
everything settles down, and you are
amazed, watching all this,

39:57.298 --> 40:03.126
that you are the centre of doing
all these things.

40:03.327 --> 40:06.979
You are not aware that you are doing,
and you are this.

40:07.180 --> 40:11.651
That ego part is missing. But you
see it’s all happening around you,

40:11.852 --> 40:16.504
and then you are amazed how it is
happening.

40:16.705 --> 40:22.324
The whole lifestyle changes, the whole
understanding changes,

40:22.525 --> 40:29.008
and you become a great source of happiness,
joy and knowledge to others.

40:29.209 --> 40:35.474
You don’t have to study anything, you don’t
have to know much,

40:35.642 --> 40:41.803
but you will know about everything,
what is right and what is wrong.

40:42.954 --> 40:48.701
And then only you can tell the things
with complete authority

40:48.902 --> 40:54.235
that, “This is not right!” Like today,
we had a discussion on this point

40:54.436 --> 40:59.230
about the economic position and
the economics of modern times.

40:59.431 --> 41:07.057
I said, “Is all wrong, because it is
self-destructive.”

41:07.258 --> 41:13.732
It destroys the nations, if not your
nation, other nations.

41:13.933 --> 41:23.037
Then it also destroys your family life.
It destroys your value system.

41:23.238 --> 41:30.484
It completely destroys you. So what sort
of an economics is this?

41:30.685 --> 41:41.618
It’s just a show, just a, like a, you can
say, a balloon: it can burst any moment.

41:41.819 --> 41:45.159
I have seen people who are very rich,
very this thing,

41:45.360 --> 41:50.763
think no end of themselves [then] become
bankrupt. And very bankrupt become rich.

41:50.964 --> 41:57.703
So it’s [a] kind of a turmoil in which
they are jumping,

41:57.904 --> 42:03.987
from one shore to another shore. But
you are not. You watch that drama.

42:04.188 --> 42:10.619
You see all that drama, and with your peace
you can see everything, very calmly.

42:10.820 --> 42:15.020
Not, it’s not difficult for you to create
more people like this.

42:15.221 --> 42:21.760
It’s not difficult to transform this world.
The time has come, just ripe time.

42:21.961 --> 42:26.210
Like when the proper time comes,
the blossom time comes,

42:26.411 --> 42:31.823
so many flowers become fruits. So,
like that, you all have become.

42:32.024 --> 42:37.259
Now it is for you to create seeds to spread
Sahaja Yoga.

42:37.460 --> 42:42.600
You are at that level of awareness now
where Paramchaitanya is with you,

42:42.801 --> 42:48.763
absolutely part and parcel of you,
absolutely with you to give you

42:48.964 --> 42:57.924
all necessary help, all necessary prestige,
and also the personality.

42:59.637 --> 43:02.443
May God bless you all.
