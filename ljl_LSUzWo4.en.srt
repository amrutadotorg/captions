00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:23,740
Shri Krishna -Virata Puja
“Rise above the Ego to enter Virata’s

2
00:07:55,659 --> 00:08:02,659
Kingdom”
September 9, 1999

3
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:16,569
Cabella, Italia

4
00:08:56,393 --> 00:08:58,673
Tonight we

5
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:12,150
are going to worship Shri Krishna as Virat.
First is important to understand the incarnation

6
00:09:15,318 --> 00:09:27,545
of Shri Krishna. Krishna word comes from the
word Krishi. Krishi means agriculture. He’s

7
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:39,806
sown the seeds of spirituality. And for that,
first of all, He had to think, “Where are

8
00:09:39,952 --> 00:09:52,246
we as far as spirituality is concerned, how
is the land?” So what had happened at the

9
00:09:52,271 --> 00:10:01,896
time of Shri Rama that He created lots of
maryadas and by these maryadas people started

10
00:10:01,921 --> 00:10:07,411
mentally thinking about it, “I am not supposed
to do that, I am not supposed to do this.”

11
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:15,712
It was just a mental binding – it was not
spontaneous, it was not sahaj. As a result

12
00:10:15,737 --> 00:10:24,283
people became extremely serious. They wouldn’t
talk much and they wouldn’t laugh; they

13
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:27,306
wouldn’t enjoy anything.

14
00:10:27,331 --> 00:10:34,541
So Shri Krishna decided that “First of all
we must remove them from this conditioning.

15
00:10:35,306 --> 00:10:43,041
And this conditioning has to be removed in
such a manner that they enjoy themselves.”

16
00:10:49,345 --> 00:10:56,391
Then He found out, there were three suggestions
as far as achieving the goal was concerned.

17
00:10:56,416 --> 00:11:11,541
So first one, as He says, is to become a realized
soul, Sthitapragya, to go beyond all temptations,

18
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:24,033
go beyond all ego, go beyond all kinds of
conditioning and to become a Sthitapragya.

19
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:39,303
Sthitapragya is where he doesn’t feel like
ordinary people attracted towards things,

20
00:11:39,866 --> 00:12:00,577
but he’s absolutely detached. And
this detached person doesn’t take to any
grievances, jealousies, all these things.

21
00:12:01,538 --> 00:12:18,561
That He told. But how to achieve it He never
told. And the second thing He described is

22
00:12:18,616 --> 00:12:25,616
that you must work. You have to work. After
all, you have got all the human tendencies

23
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:34,583
– is to work. But the fruit of the work,
you leave it at the Lotus Feet of God or you

24
00:12:34,886 --> 00:12:41,169
may call the divine Power. This is another
trick of His, because He realized how human

25
00:12:41,188 --> 00:12:46,657
beings were twisted and how they had a ego.
If you tell them something, how they’ll

26
00:12:46,657 --> 00:12:53,657
misinterpret it. So He took the other way
round, that tell them something absurd. Now

27
00:12:53,728 --> 00:13:08,031
whatever work you do, your ego is intact and
with that ego, you can never give it up at

28
00:13:08,318 --> 00:13:15,689
the Lotus Feet of the Divine, then impossible.
So He made a impossible situation, that after

29
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:23,900
some time people will realize that this cannot
be done and they’ll give up this idea of

30
00:13:24,558 --> 00:13:32,603
leaving everything at the Lotus Feet of the
Divine. This was the one how He prepared the

31
00:13:32,628 --> 00:13:35,718
land.

32
00:13:35,718 --> 00:13:50,793
Second thing He said, “Pushpam phalam toyum.
Flowers, fruit and water. Whatever you offer

33
00:13:50,818 --> 00:13:59,632
Me, I will take it. I’ll take it.” But
when you do that, when you do that you must

34
00:13:59,657 --> 00:14:15,293
have ananya bhakti. Ananya means completely
single-minded bhakti, when there is not the

35
00:14:15,318 --> 00:14:25,252
other. This is only possible after realization.
Only after realization you can put the fruits

36
00:14:25,277 --> 00:14:34,262
of your work at the Lotus Feet of the Divine.
And only after Self-realization you can have

37
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:45,549
ananya bhakti – means the devotion which
is singular. These absurd conditions He put

38
00:14:45,578 --> 00:14:50,688
for human beings because they were so much
complicated.

39
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:55,308
So many people tell Me, “Mother we are doing
ananya bhakti.”

40
00:14:55,308 --> 00:14:55,558
“How?”

41
00:14:55,448 --> 00:15:01,568
“Because we are singing on the street, we
are taking the name of God all the time. We

42
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:09,885
are going to Pandharipur, you see, in rags
and for one month we walk singing, singing,

43
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,650
singing.”

44
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:22,493
This kind of absurd ideas about bhakti, He
never gave. But it is the way He wanted to

45
00:15:22,518 --> 00:15:29,667
neutralize the absurdities of human beings,
that they thought this was the bhakti. Which

46
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:37,803
is not. Ananya bhakti is only possible when
you are realized soul, when you are connected

47
00:15:37,828 --> 00:15:41,258
with the Divine, when there’s not the other.

48
00:15:41,258 --> 00:15:53,393
This is how He tried to make three-way attack
I should (say), on human beings, in a way,

49
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:58,018
on their stupidity. Because He thought that
“If I tell them directly do like this, do

50
00:15:58,018 --> 00:16:04,508
like that, then they’ll say, ‘Of course
we did it, and still we never achieved it.’”

51
00:16:04,508 --> 00:16:12,885
In India there’s a big cult, we can call
it – people who go to Pandharipur. For one

52
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:22,049
month they walk in rags, singing the songs
and on the way they go on eating food at different

53
00:16:22,117 --> 00:16:28,908
places. According to them this is ananya bhakti,
and they achieve nothing. They have become

54
00:16:28,908 --> 00:16:39,408
very sick and very tired and have a very bad
old age. But who can tell them? They are all

55
00:16:39,558 --> 00:16:51,313
lost in it. So this is a way one could tackle
human beings to show their stupidity. And

56
00:16:51,338 --> 00:16:57,248
so many people come and ask Me, as I told
you, that “How is it we do so much bhakti

57
00:16:57,248 --> 00:17:01,677
of Shri Krishna and we have achieved nothing?”

58
00:17:01,677 --> 00:17:10,343
So He’s the One who prepared the land for
sowing. We can say He’s the One who was

59
00:17:10,368 --> 00:17:16,927
like a very great agriculturist. So His name
was Krishi – Krishna. There are so many

60
00:17:16,927 --> 00:17:23,398
things I have told you about Him: how His
name came as Krishna, then as how He was called

61
00:17:23,398 --> 00:17:36,408
as Radha, who was Radha, who was Krishna and
all those things. But when He talked of these

62
00:17:36,858 --> 00:17:43,858
things also He told that you should become
Sthitapragya. That is they call as Gyana Yoga.

63
00:17:44,828 --> 00:17:52,228
Gyana means knowledge. So, you should get
absolute knowledge. That He didn’t say how.

64
00:17:52,358 --> 00:17:58,955
That you know, what is absolute knowledge,
which you can feel it on your finger tips

65
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,770
in Sahaja Yoga.

66
00:18:03,002 --> 00:18:10,244
Another thing is, His specialty was to create
discretion in people. He thought by doing

67
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:16,658
all these things in a stupid manner, they
might develop a discretion to know that this

68
00:18:16,658 --> 00:18:23,038
is not the way you can achieve anything. You
have to get your Self-realization. Discretion

69
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:33,533
was very important. At this juncture, when
we are facing a sort of a challenge of this

70
00:18:34,068 --> 00:18:42,025
new millennium – that the whole world is
going to be destroyed and all those things

71
00:18:42,108 --> 00:18:50,197
people are talking – it is really very important
to know through discretion what is good and

72
00:18:50,222 --> 00:18:59,900
what is bad. One may talk of something as
very good, something as very bad. But the

73
00:19:00,025 --> 00:19:09,096
divine Discretion is very, very different.
Very different and which acts by Itself. Once

74
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:14,978
you are in the realm of divine Discretion
you cannot commit mistakes – even if you

75
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:16,432
want to do it.

76
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:28,323
I’ll give you My example. We went to buy
a house and the fellow was, you see, like

77
00:19:28,348 --> 00:19:36,202
a beggar he came. He said, “We have nothing.
We have no food. They have taken away all

78
00:19:36,227 --> 00:19:43,833
our things and we are just absolutely starving.”
When they said that, when he said that “We

79
00:19:43,858 --> 00:19:49,438
are starving, we have nothing,” so I felt
pity for him.

80
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:53,418
I said, “All right, increase the price.”
First we increased the price.

81
00:19:53,418 --> 00:19:56,747
Still he was saying, “No, no give us more.”

82
00:19:56,747 --> 00:20:03,048
Still we increased the price. I told My husband,
“You increase the price.” Though reluctantly,

83
00:20:03,048 --> 00:20:06,878
he increased the price. Third time again we
increased the price.

84
00:20:06,878 --> 00:20:13,878
Then he said, “No, we’ll have something
more than that, a little more.”

85
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:19,398
Immediately you see, this Discretion worked
and I said, “These are hypocrites.” I

86
00:20:19,398 --> 00:20:26,633
just left them and sat in the car – at the
right moment. That was not such a good proposition

87
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:34,471
or anything. But I could see they, I’m buying
it out of My pity; you may call it compassion.

88
00:20:35,247 --> 00:20:41,578
But above the compassion was this Discretion,
which said, “Nothing doing, You better get

89
00:20:41,578 --> 00:20:48,763
out of it.” So this divine Discretion is
a very, very important thing, which we should

90
00:20:48,788 --> 00:20:56,503
see how it works and should be satisfied with
it. Not to feel bad, that you have missed

91
00:20:56,528 --> 00:21:02,788
a chance or anything, but you must feel very
happy that this thing has happened and that

92
00:21:02,788 --> 00:21:07,878
your divine discretion has taken on.

93
00:21:07,878 --> 00:21:14,798
So sometimes it appears that, in that divine
discretion you may do something wrong, you

94
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:21,798
have done something wrong. But if it is divine,
ultimately it will turn out to be very good.

95
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:31,108
I gave you a very basic example. But that
is also very true when you practice Sahaja

96
00:21:34,318 --> 00:21:44,322
Yoga. The discretion of divine Discretion
is extremely important to play a very great

97
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:53,702
part in our lives, because this divine Discretion
gives us the real joy of our being, of our

98
00:21:53,727 --> 00:21:55,424
self, of Sahaja Yoga.

99
00:21:57,408 --> 00:22:06,952
So the third point was for Him to make people
joyous and happy. But with all these maryadas

100
00:22:06,977 --> 00:22:15,732
of Shri Rama, He didn’t know how to do it.
So to give people joy He said, “All right,

101
00:22:15,757 --> 00:22:24,057
let us dance, let us sing, let us play Holi,
all sorts of things,” and with that He really

102
00:22:24,082 --> 00:22:32,158
originated many things which were sort of
not serious. May look frivolous, but in that

103
00:22:32,183 --> 00:22:43,123
there was joy expressing. All that He did
to give them a full idea as for a Sahaja yogi

104
00:22:43,148 --> 00:22:50,048
or for a, you can say, for a self realized
soul, what should be the attitude towards

105
00:22:50,048 --> 00:22:58,492
everything. But it is not that you have to
do it, but it just works out, it is like that,

106
00:22:58,517 --> 00:23:09,596
that in the state of Sahaj, you enjoy everything.
Enjoyment. And that is what His idea was,

107
00:23:09,737 --> 00:23:17,543
to create a sense of joy among people. Many
people – there are lots of critics – have

108
00:23:17,568 --> 00:23:21,108
criticized this part of His life. According
to them, religion means you should become

109
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:30,063
just old. At the age of twenty years you should
become an old man of eighty years – something

110
00:23:30,088 --> 00:23:39,923
like that, funny ideas of religious achievement.
But He talked of joy and He never talked of

111
00:23:39,948 --> 00:23:46,918
renunciation. He never talked that “You
give up your family, you give up your children,

112
00:23:46,918 --> 00:23:55,308
you give up everything,” never, never. He
said, “You must enjoy, enjoy with detachment.”

113
00:23:55,858 --> 00:24:01,977
For people it is very difficult to understand
how can it be it is without detachment. With

114
00:24:01,977 --> 00:24:09,593
attachment you can never enjoy. If you are
attached to something, you cannot enjoy anything

115
00:24:09,618 --> 00:24:15,247
in a full way. Like, supposing you are attached
to your child. Very simple thing, you are

116
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:21,678
attached to your child. You’re attached
to your child, then you will be bothered about

117
00:24:21,678 --> 00:24:26,478
things which should not be there, which will
not give joy to the child either. You’ll

118
00:24:26,478 --> 00:24:34,293
not allow your child, say, to go out or to
talk to people, whatever it is – all kinds

119
00:24:34,318 --> 00:24:43,913
of restrictions you will put. But if you have
really the divine discretion, then you will

120
00:24:43,938 --> 00:24:50,568
know with whom he should talk, where he should
go, what he should enjoy and you will see

121
00:24:50,568 --> 00:24:54,175
that he enjoys life.

122
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:02,580
Any attachment with anything doesn’t give
you the full view of that person, of that

123
00:25:02,605 --> 00:25:14,245
thing. If you are detached, then you can see
it, say, from above … above him, above the

124
00:25:14,418 --> 00:25:21,218
thing. If you are detached, you become thoughtlessly
aware, also. As I said, now, see the carpets

125
00:25:21,218 --> 00:25:29,862
are there. They are very, very beautiful carpets.
Now if they are here, if they are Mine, I’ll

126
00:25:29,887 --> 00:25:34,517
be worried, I’ll be all the time worried
because I am attached – that these carpets

127
00:25:34,517 --> 00:25:40,808
should not be spoilt, something will go wrong.
But if I’m not attached, I’ll look at

128
00:25:40,808 --> 00:25:47,808
those carpets and what do I see? The joy.
The joy that is put in by the artist who has

129
00:25:48,517 --> 00:26:02,583
made them. And that joy really tries to reflect
in Me also. That joy comes in Me. So to have

130
00:26:02,608 --> 00:26:11,630
anything, attachment to anything, there will
be joy … I should say there’ll be happiness

131
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:21,583
but not joy. Because joy is single and happiness
is double – happiness and unhappiness.

132
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:26,887
So even if I try to enjoy something, I’ll
think, “Oh, still there, this, this point

133
00:26:26,887 --> 00:26:36,567
is there.” But joy is all pervading. It
has no boundaries. And you just get dissolved,

134
00:26:36,598 --> 00:26:44,972
you get dissolved in the ocean of joy. That
was what Shri Krishna’s idea was, that cut

135
00:26:44,997 --> 00:26:54,247
out these maryadas. Nowadays we see the maryadas
of so many things are really useless. For

136
00:26:54,856 --> 00:27:02,017
example, you have discovered the maryadas
of religion. See when they live in maryadas

137
00:27:02,228 --> 00:27:10,661
then what happens? They sort of coggle it
or they have all kinds of germination inside

138
00:27:11,678 --> 00:27:20,075
like the pond, which is absolutely bound,
it is not flowing like river. So like that,

139
00:27:20,888 --> 00:27:33,802
you see, it becomes a kind of a closed mind
with these maryadas. And when you have this

140
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:41,122
maryadas, you start thinking, “Whether I
should do it or not; whether I’ll enjoy

141
00:27:41,147 --> 00:27:47,278
it or not.” With these maryadas only, you
kill the joy.

142
00:27:47,303 --> 00:27:53,397
Now we have other maryadas about, say, we
have country … as I said about the religion.

143
00:27:53,397 --> 00:27:59,818
Now many people who love to come to Sahaj
Yoga, but because they have maryadas of silly

144
00:27:59,818 --> 00:28:06,818
things of their religion, they cannot come.
They think, “This is our religion,” while

145
00:28:07,168 --> 00:28:12,928
they don’t understand. Falsehood becomes
the maryadas and they don’t understand that

146
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:18,438
what is the maryada actually made by the religion
also.

147
00:28:18,438 --> 00:28:24,968
You see now in Islam what is happening is.
With these maryadas, they want to have another

148
00:28:24,968 --> 00:28:32,552
country, this thing, that thing. In other
Christian religion also same thing happening.

149
00:28:32,637 --> 00:28:39,397
Also in Hindu religion. All these maryadas
are really stagnating them completely, and

150
00:28:39,397 --> 00:28:48,092
they are getting crushed into it. There’s
no discretion. Because they have said it,

151
00:28:48,117 --> 00:28:56,212
they do it. They are so much blind-folded
about it, that they cannot see what is right

152
00:28:56,237 --> 00:29:03,237
and what is wrong. But after Sahaj, you can
see, you can laugh at them and you can see.

153
00:29:03,358 --> 00:29:10,793
Then we have social maryadas. Social maryadas
are there which are sometimes, when abandoned

154
00:29:10,818 --> 00:29:17,818
can become very horrid also. Like in the West
now, the women think that the less dress they

155
00:29:18,098 --> 00:29:28,153
wear, the more beautiful they are. This is
a new thing they have started. Now this absurd.

156
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:35,943
If you see the discretion behind is very simple:
that we have been animals and now we don’t

157
00:29:35,968 --> 00:29:44,472
want to have any clothes because we were animals.
Is a animal heritage that if … that’s

158
00:29:44,497 --> 00:29:51,803
why so many women do not want to wear full
dresses. It’s just animal behavior. So the

159
00:29:51,828 --> 00:29:58,828
maryada of – good maryadas also people can
give up saying that “We don’t want any

160
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:05,137
maryadas. We are free; we can do whatever
we like.” But in that freedom what do you

161
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:12,137
achieve? Your animal instinct works in that
freedom and you think you are a very free

162
00:30:12,162 --> 00:30:13,308
personality.

163
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:19,558
Then we have maryadas of our country. God
has not made different, different countries

164
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:26,763
at all. Nor it is true there are different
countries, but variety is there. Variety of

165
00:30:26,788 --> 00:30:33,788
people, variety of places is there. These
varieties must be accepted as something very

166
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:41,558
artistic and one should not get ruined and
confused with those ideas that “We are Americans,

167
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:47,438
we are Indians, we are this and we are that.”
You’re not. Now you can know after Sahaja

168
00:30:47,438 --> 00:30:54,438
Yoga, that you are all Sahaja yogis and you
don’t belong to any country as such. The

169
00:30:54,588 --> 00:30:57,548
country may belong to you, but you don’t
belong to the country.

170
00:30:57,573 --> 00:31:06,453
I mean the work is today to understand that
if you really want to care for all these countries

171
00:31:06,478 --> 00:31:14,763
and all that, then you must do some work – work
of Sahaja Yoga so that people get rid of these

172
00:31:14,788 --> 00:31:21,517
silly ideas of fighting for territory, for
this, for that. All over the world there’s

173
00:31:21,517 --> 00:31:28,517
going on, “We want this land; we want that
land.” Land belongs to God, not to human

174
00:31:28,647 --> 00:31:34,877
beings. And what is the use of fighting for
land? I don’t understand. But this confusion

175
00:31:34,877 --> 00:31:40,798
is there and illusion is there. And people
work out on this confusion and illusion to

176
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:45,918
such an extent that they ruin their lives,
the lives of their children. So many people

177
00:31:45,918 --> 00:31:54,307
are lost, so many people are in the lunatic
asylum, I should say, because they end up

178
00:31:54,678 --> 00:32:01,678
in some sort of a refugee camp. They are having
a good house, nicely living there. Then you

179
00:32:01,678 --> 00:32:09,121
become a refugee. Why? Because they believe
that they can have their own land, they can

180
00:32:09,146 --> 00:32:14,968
have their own place and they should live
there.

181
00:32:14,968 --> 00:32:22,092
This idea comes, I think, from some stupid
leaders who want to have for themselves these

182
00:32:22,117 --> 00:32:29,693
lands and that’s how people fight for land.
There’s no need to fight for land or fight

183
00:32:29,718 --> 00:32:36,127
for your country or fight for this or fight
for that. But the situation is such that unless

184
00:32:36,127 --> 00:32:43,127
and until you fight, you cannot get to the
truth. And that’s why if you remember that

185
00:32:43,318 --> 00:32:51,174
Shri Krishna told Arjuna that “You fight.
Fight. You have to fight, that’s your work.

186
00:32:51,237 --> 00:32:57,698
You have to fight these people, because they
are the people who do not live with dharma.

187
00:32:57,698 --> 00:33:01,408
They are adharmis, so you have to fight.”

188
00:33:01,408 --> 00:33:09,643
And that is how his fighting was so much justified,
because after fighting the war they got back

189
00:33:09,668 --> 00:33:18,063
what they deserved. They were deceived, and
this is what Shri Krishna said that “You

190
00:33:18,088 --> 00:33:26,348
should not by any chance become a slave of
these people, but you fight it back.”

191
00:33:28,699 --> 00:33:35,838
So fighting also is justified in the divine
discretion. Is again the divine discretion

192
00:33:36,257 --> 00:33:41,357
where you have to fight because you don’t
want to be a slave. If you are a slave, you

193
00:33:41,357 --> 00:33:48,863
are no good. So for that you can fight. But
when people start fighting for separation

194
00:33:49,218 --> 00:33:56,816
of a territory, is not correct. On the contrary,
one should never think of separating from

195
00:33:56,941 --> 00:34:04,328
the main lands. Because it creates lots of
problems. But now we believe in the global

196
00:34:04,367 --> 00:34:11,188
religion. We believe in the global territory.
We don’t have to ask for anything. Anywhere

197
00:34:11,188 --> 00:34:20,393
you go, you are the citizen of that place.
Anybody who wants to go to Russia ever, the

198
00:34:20,418 --> 00:34:23,987
whole Russians will be with you. You go to
America, they’ll be with you. That’s how

199
00:34:23,987 --> 00:34:30,918
because all these are ideas of human beings,
and if the human beings get transformed there

200
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:37,918
will be no problem of any war or any territory
to be achieved.

201
00:34:38,197 --> 00:34:46,012
This was the divine Discretion of Shri Krishna,
which is instilled within us. As you know

202
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:58,027
that this is a part and parcel of the Vishuddhi
Chakra, where Shri Krishna resides; but when

203
00:34:58,316 --> 00:35:09,373
He rises to your Sahasrara, when He rises
to that level, then He becomes Virata. So

204
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:22,632
Virata’s Chakra is placed in the head, here
above the Agnya, and this Virat is the form

205
00:35:22,657 --> 00:35:33,183
of Shri Krishna who has risen above the Agnya.
When you are risen above the Agnya, you become

206
00:35:33,268 --> 00:35:43,783
a part and parcel of Virata’s land, we can
say. Because, unless and until you are above

207
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:52,882
your ego, you are still involved with yourself
and with wrong ideas of maryadas. But when

208
00:35:52,907 --> 00:36:00,832
you rise above that and you become the Virat,
the great, then you are in the land of Virata.

209
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:09,519
And Virata’s powers are tremendous. Has
been seen by Arjuna – the form of Virat.

210
00:36:09,988 --> 00:36:18,152
The power of Virat becomes so tremendous that
it acts globally. It acts in such a manner

211
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:31,554
that you sit here and anywhere it can act.
You have seen that now. Many a times people

212
00:36:31,617 --> 00:36:38,907
say, “Mother it’s a miracle. My mother
was sick and she was not here and I just prayed

213
00:36:38,927 --> 00:36:45,617
and she got all right.” This is all the
power of Virat.

214
00:36:45,617 --> 00:36:54,143
The power of Virata is that it can penetrate
into the subtle side of human beings in such

215
00:36:54,168 --> 00:37:01,563
a manner that everything we are connected
with. We are not separate. And every drop

216
00:37:01,588 --> 00:37:09,273
is connected with the ocean. We are connected
with the whole universe. And when you become

217
00:37:09,298 --> 00:37:20,383
a citizens, I should say, of Virat, then all
the things with which you are connected also

218
00:37:20,418 --> 00:37:33,983
get your vibrations, your ideas, your ambitions.
Everything passes through that and it works

219
00:37:34,008 --> 00:37:35,766
– it works.

220
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:42,918
You have seen how many miracles have taken
place in your lives. It is the Virata Shakti

221
00:37:42,985 --> 00:37:57,358
that works. Now for that we have to know how
to do worship of Virata. First of all you

222
00:37:57,558 --> 00:38:07,855
have to rise above your ego – very important.
Otherwise how can you worship? There is your

223
00:38:08,566 --> 00:38:17,402
ego standing in between and how can you rise
up to the point of Virat? You have to pass

224
00:38:17,478 --> 00:38:27,603
through that. Once you are above your ego,
you enter into the kingdom of Virata. There

225
00:38:27,628 --> 00:38:36,285
the King is the Virat and you are the subject
who are looked after completely by Virata

226
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:40,058
Shakti, by the power of Virata.

227
00:38:40,058 --> 00:38:47,632
But at that stage you become really a universal
personality, in a way, because whatever are

228
00:38:47,657 --> 00:38:54,617
problems universally – now not necessarily
that they should be attached to you or connected

229
00:38:54,617 --> 00:39:01,617
to you. Supposing a person is of that level.
Now there may be a war in some other country

230
00:39:02,367 --> 00:39:13,746
– it can stop. Somebody who is being oppressed
can win over. Anywhere your compassion moves

231
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:20,488
it works out. Whenever your attention will
go, it will work out. And sometimes you are

232
00:39:20,488 --> 00:39:27,318
surprised as to how it works, “Mother, how
these things work out? How coincidences … how

233
00:39:27,318 --> 00:39:34,822
these coincidences have taken place?” Only
thing is you have crossed that state of your

234
00:39:34,847 --> 00:39:41,718
ego and have gone into the state of Virat,
which is a very important thing to do – is

235
00:39:41,718 --> 00:39:48,718
to enter into the area of Virata. Then you
don’t think, “This is your country. This

236
00:39:48,847 --> 00:39:50,887
belongs to you, that belongs to you.”

237
00:39:50,887 --> 00:39:58,902
This belonging business finishes off. Then
you belong to Virat. And He uses you for His

238
00:39:58,927 --> 00:40:07,226
own purpose in the sense that when your whole
thinking is different – becomes global thinking,

239
00:40:07,398 --> 00:40:17,671
then He acts. And then His powers are many-fold.
And Krishna’s power is that He uses a conch

240
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:25,993
to call people. I have given conches to all
the leaders. So we have to now announce and

241
00:40:26,018 --> 00:40:37,269
call people. But at the level of Virat, you
don’t have to do all that. At the level

242
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:47,913
of Virat it just – people see, they’ll
know. Just they will watch you and they will

243
00:40:47,938 --> 00:40:57,012
know. Just they will think you are human beings
and you are so sweet, so good, just like gems

244
00:40:57,058 --> 00:41:04,058
shining all the time. So, they’ll be impressed.
This comes through the Virata’s blessing.

245
00:41:04,238 --> 00:41:11,824
When you become that, then you forget about
other things like you have big positions or

246
00:41:11,858 --> 00:41:19,513
anything, you come from a very rich family
or that – all these nonsensical things which

247
00:41:19,538 --> 00:41:28,613
are actually not true. And all these things
on which you want to exist are no more. People

248
00:41:28,638 --> 00:41:41,853
like to show off their wealth, some people
like to be very sort of demonstrative of what

249
00:41:41,878 --> 00:41:50,691
they think they are. But in the case of a
person who rises above his ego, and he’s

250
00:41:50,788 --> 00:41:58,894
a part and parcel of that Virata shakti, enters
into the kingdom of Virata, he knows he is

251
00:41:58,937 --> 00:42:07,333
very small. He is very small compared to that
and he just dissolves into that Shakti. And

252
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:14,793
this should happen to us that we should humble
down. We should humble down and know that

253
00:42:14,818 --> 00:42:22,590
our powers, whatever we have, if they give
us ego, we should get rid of it. We should

254
00:42:22,855 --> 00:42:31,121
not have that ego. We should get rid of it
and we should actually achieve that state

255
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:38,683
where you can be called as citizens of the
Virata’s Power.

256
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:44,230
May God bless you all.

257
00:44:43,223 --> 00:44:47,293
Now when you are entering into the kingdom
of Virata, you have

258
00:48:13,805 --> 00:48:20,805
to be

259
00:44:47,576 --> 00:44:57,871
like children. You are children there. As
children you enter. As Christ has said, “When

260
00:44:57,896 --> 00:45:01,346
you enter into the Kingdom of God
you have to

261
00:45:01,354 --> 00:45:04,571
be like children.” And that’s what you
have to

262
00:45:04,596 --> 00:45:06,688
be today, all of you to

263
00:45:06,713 --> 00:45:11,032
be innocent like children. You have to

264
00:45:11,057 --> 00:45:15,158
be innocent like children.
