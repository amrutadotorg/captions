1
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:08,060
Today is the birthday of Guru Nanaka.

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,410
It is being celebrated through-out the world

3
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:19,720
with so much of zeal that I have not seen in India.

4
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,760
For the first time it has been advertised in so many papers and by different means.

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,980
Guru Nanaka always talked of Sahaja Yoga.

6
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:33,720
Everything else, He said, is just showing off.

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,470
About religion He said that observing fasts, going on pilgrimage, etc.,

8
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:42,050
are just meant to show off.

9
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:47,950
Now you have to discover the power that is within you and establish it.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,100
Guru Nanaka kept on repeating the same thing again and again.

11
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:58,970
He never talked of rituals:

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:07,420
But when Guru Teg- Bahadur came, tomorrow is his martyrs day,

13
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:13,900
He was also of the same opinion

14
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:18,470
but when there was the last Guru,

15
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:26,020
war was being fought. So he prescribed Kada (iron bangle), long hair (not to cut hair) etc.

16
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:33,370
All this was prescribed by him. But Guru Nanaka always talked of the spirit.

17
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,370
Everything else is of no value,

18
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,670
He explained it very clearly, but no one heeded what He wrote.

19
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:44,870
They will just put a finger on the couplet and read it out.

20
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,870
Could we understand him this way?

21
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,900
If we go through His writings properly and absorb it,

22
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:56,350
then the whole Shabad-Jalam (confusion), in which most of the people are caught, will come to an end.

23
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,570
See the condition of Sikhs!

24
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:04,400
They are not looking within themselves, which they should.

25
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,620
Without looking within oneself, how could one follow Sikh religion?

26
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:14,050
Only this is the teaching of Guru Nanaka, this is what is called `Sikhi’ (learning).

27
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,470
This you have got in written, read it.

28
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:23,470
All the saints of that age, before that age and after that,

29
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,820
you have the discretion to know who is a saint and who is not.

30
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:35,880
All the Gurus incorporated their poems and experiences in Guru Grantha and that is why Guru Grantha is revered so much.

31
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:45,560
All the people, who were renowned as great Gurus at that time,

32
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,760
had done great work and were spiritual,

33
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,600
all their work was consolidated and put into Guru Granth Sahib.

34
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
That is what we do in Sahaja Yoga.

35
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:00,360
We do not follow any particular saint or incarnation; we respect all of them.

36
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,960
This is what He did at that time. But whatever was said, was lost in words.

37
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,040
People did not go deeper in them.

38
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:22,360
That is why Kabira has written `even the scholars went on reading and reading like fools, without absorbing anything That is how a race of fools was created.

39
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:39,920
Now there is no war being fought but they are so conditioned that they will wear Turbans, keep swords and combs etc.

40
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,520
But they have no objection in consuming Alcohol.

41
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,520
All the Gurus warned the disciples about the evil effects of alcohol.

42
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,320
Any one talking of consciousness could never support wine.

43
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:58,000
On the one side they will consume alcohol, on the other they wear turbans, keep swords and combs, and they are very conditioned about that!

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,600
They wish to create a clan and be part of that clan.

45
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:10,640
If they are busy doing all these things, when is the inner transformation going to take place, that He has talked about?

46
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,920
They have taken to this kind of ritualism and as a result have come outside.

47
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,200
Their attention is outside, they understand everything that is outside.

48
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:28,480
To direct these people towards Sahaja yoga, should not be difficult because we (Sahaja Yogis) are doing what the He preached.

49
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,280
He did not accomplish it; this is the difference that we have been doing it and He didn´t.

50
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,520
They talked of achieving `Sahaja Samadhi’.

51
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,720
How? It will happen thanks to Kundalini, even this fact was made clear.

52
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,840
But who would raise the Kundalini? This He didn´t mention.

53
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:51,120
Guru Nanaka gave realization to only two of his disciples.

54
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,200
If one Guru gives realization to only two of his disciples, how effective can it be?

55
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,280
So, people took His external form and started their work.

56
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:10,440
Huge Gurudwaras were built. But there is no use.

57
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:19,160
Very few evolved beings were made, the remaining is just a race of Sardars. How could truth be told to them?

58
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:29,400
But now Sikhs have started coming to Sahaja Yoga, I have seen. At least 8 – 10 sikhs come regularly

59
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,520
with turbans on. May be some of them are coming without turbans.

60
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,720
There are also One is Namdhari Sikhs. Namdhari Sikhs believe in Me.

61
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,640
There are many Namdhari Sikhs in Bankok.

62
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,800
As many as fifty-sixty of them come to the Programme.

63
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,800
They wear white turbans.

64
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:56,320
I do not know what is their speciality, but they follow what Guru Nanak has said.

65
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:05,120
That is how diversions are created and people start fighting amongst themselves. What for?

66
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:21,440
Guru Nanaka said that I am prophet of Mohammedans and Guru of Hindus.

67
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,040
Until one is realized one cannot understand this.

68
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:32,320
But it was necessary to prepare us for this day.

69
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:39,880
Now it is our duty to work-out what they said.

70
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:47,960
Things, however, went in opposite direction and many seekers were lost, no-one knows where!

71
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,160
I was talking about Gyan Deva, how great He was.

72
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,160
He belongs to Nath cult.

73
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,520
He wrote about Kundalini.

74
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,240
His disciples call themselves varkaris.

75
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,240
They make a show.

76
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:12,760
They take two big heavy cymbals in their hands, weighing one kg together, beating these cymbals all the way long they go to Pandhari Nath, Pandhar Pur.

77
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:19,120
The clothes they wear are called lattar, they are made up of jute and are torn.

78
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,240
They consider themselves to be very sacrificing and It takes them one month to reach there, beating the cymbals.

79
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,240
All the way they chew tobacco.

80
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:33,400
These Varkari people have created this cult.

81
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:41,680
The speciality of this cult is that they take procession of Gyan Deva on a palanquin.

82
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:49,200
Gyan Deva never afforded shoes when he was alive, but people place his slipper, in the palanquin and take the procession from one village to another.

83
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,560
When they reach a village, as the palanquin arrived the villagers offer them food and refreshment.

84
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,560
Then they go to another village, again villagers offer them food as the palanquin had arrived.

85
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,800
It is a new method of beggary.

86
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:08,400
Thirdly, He was born in Alandi, near Pune.

87
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,040
Later he went to Niwase, there He ....

88
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:27,080
Women there take earthen pots with Tulsi in them and filled with soil, at least 3 – 4 kg,

89
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,560
lift it on their heads and walk-in procession to Anandi.

90
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,920
This I have seen myself.

91
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,920
I do not understand, why they do so.

92
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:42,120
People have made lot of money in the name of Gyna Deva.

93
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,360
But I do not how people can believe in them.

94
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,160
All His purpose has forfeited.

95
00:08:52,160 --> 00:09:06,680
One fellow gives big big lecture on Gyan Deva and earns a lot of money, speaks whatever he feels like and there are people listen to him.

96
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,080
People are full of blind faith!

97
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,400
Same is the case with Guru Nanaka.

98
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,760
No one knows what He actually said and what he didn´t.

99
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,320
People have made Chandigarh, Guru Nanaka talked of Chandi.

100
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,320
He talked of My incarnation on the earth.

101
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,320
He explained everything.

102
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,760
But no one reads or listen to that.

103
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,760
All of the prophets and Gurus have been treated like that.

104
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,360
Now you have got the self-realisation.

105
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:41,080
ou people have experienced the truth. So, you cannot accept the falsehood.

106
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,640
If some falsehood emerges out of Sahaja, it will be destroyed.

107
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:50,120
So many people have got their self-realization in the world, now falsehood cannot be spread.

108
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,720
Whatever I have told in Sahaja Yoga is taped and recorded.

109
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,720
No one could change it.

110
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,200
This is why I didn´t write book.

111
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:04,960
People should listen to tapes, but they go on reading books without understanding.

112
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:12,280
It is better to have fewer books and there should be more to listen.

113
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,120
Listening to the tapes will definitely have impact on their minds.

114
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,120
People take book reading as a means of entertainment.

115
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,120
What is the use of it?

116
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,240
Now we will see what happens to Sahaja Yoga.

117
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,120
I do not know.

118
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,960
But now Sahaja Yogis have reached a level from where they cannot go astray, I believe.

119
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,960
Do not take to wrongdoings.

120
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:46,960
We have to learn from the life of Guru Nanaka, from what He said, He wrote a bunch of books, if we read Gurbani, it says `know thyself´.

121
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:54,160
But what people are doing! However, in Sahaja Yoga such things will not happen since I have made them all mature.

122
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,160
They cannot change now.

123
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,960
No harm could be done now, even if someone wants to; what has happened has happened.

124
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:09,480
He was disrespected, He had hard times, a lot was created by Him,

125
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:16,720
but there is a point I would mention that He did not give self-realisation, He didn´t make people experience.

126
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:27,440
And now, you may blame anyone, but it can happen only by awakening not by making changes in some scripture.

127
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:37,520
This is what we should learn from Him that we will not go astray or we will notdraw any other meaning of it (Sahaja yoga), this is important.

128
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:46,480
We are Sahaj yogis and we understand Sahaja Yoga so deeply that now there is no need to draw any other meaning of it.

129
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,240
Still there are people, one or two, who start dictating – “Do this way or that way”.

130
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,240
It is all useless.

131
00:11:52,240 --> 00:12:05,760
All falsehood, without any truth in it. They dictate – “Do this way or that way”

132
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:14,480
I have never said so, yet people are doing what I have never said.

133
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,000
So now when they will listen and learn.

134
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,520
By reading it cannot be conceived that much, as much can be conceived by listening.

135
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,160
They will understand Mother has not said that therefore they will not do that.

136
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,600
But because of old Sanskara (conditioning) we keep on observing certain rituals.

137
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,240
Secondly, they want to practise, what they have been practising since their birth.

138
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,880
So long as we do not get rid of our conditionings, we shall not understand real Sahaja Yoga.

139
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,880
I have made you very special people.

140
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,640
You are special people.

141
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,200
You know the real meaning of religion.

142
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,440
You know everything, you know about yourself and about others.

143
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,440
You could give realisation to people.

144
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,720
So now you have become perfect.

145
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,600
So, what is there to go astray now? You cannot fall.

146
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,840
So today I thought of the pains of Guru Nanaka.

147
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,760
How much he tolerated! His wife was not cooperative at all.

148
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,560
He had problems, even then He did so much.

149
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,000
What people have made of his achievements?

150
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:28,920
These people are misusing Lord Christ, Mohammad Sahib and, above all, Guru Nanaka because he was the last incarnation.

151
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,080
He worked a lot.

152
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,920
Shirdi Sainath incarnated after him.

153
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,120
He said there is no need, there is no use doing anything, He said clearly,

154
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:49,200
whatever is started, people spoil it after some time, because they are not awakened.

155
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,160
After awakening, things change of course.

156
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,160
People become one, they become wise.

157
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,640
Without realization it is difficult.

158
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:03,160
So, Sai Nath did not anything, He did not organise people, He did not unite people, nothing.

159
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,160
He had disciples, that is all.

160
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,400
I have also not organised.

161
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
We have no organization.

162
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:20,000
People automatically get organized after awakening, the way different organs of the body are organized.

163
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:28,680
So, without any organization everything is going on immaculately in Sahaja Yoga.

164
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:37,320
My eternal blessings to you all.

165
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:44,240
You have to keep in mind that we have not to pervert what we have achieved.

166
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,240
It is most sacrilegious.

167
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,440
Do not pervert it, for any reason.

168
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,440
Perversion should not be allowed.

169
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,640
My eternal bless
