WEBVTT

00:02.430 --> 00:07.550
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:08.830 --> 00:12.470
We have to understand

00:12.710 --> 00:18.630
that God has created us as human beings with a purpose.

00:19.150 --> 00:21.830
But in those modern times,

00:22.070 --> 00:24.150
when we don’t even believe in God,

00:24.390 --> 00:29.070
or on a, in a Creator, or any such energy that exists,

00:29.310 --> 00:31.430
it’s very hard to talk of God

00:31.630 --> 00:33.630
and to introduce

00:33.910 --> 00:38.390
Him to be the One who has made us human beings.

00:38.630 --> 00:42.070
But even Darwin

00:42.310 --> 00:45.630
said that if man has come so far

00:45.910 --> 00:51.230
he will have to go a little further to understand himself.

00:51.470 --> 00:53.910
I would suggest that

00:54.110 --> 00:57.230
one has to only understand one point,

00:57.470 --> 01:00.310
that whatever we have so far known

01:00.550 --> 01:04.390
has been the knowledge of the tree.

01:04.710 --> 01:09.830
But we have to have the knowledge of the roots.

01:10.110 --> 01:12.550
To get the knowledge of the roots,

01:12.870 --> 01:16.390
we have to become subtler than what we are.

01:16.630 --> 01:21.550
This awareness, this human awareness, cannot take us that side.

01:21.790 --> 01:27.230
For example, you are all listening to Me very intensely,

01:27.470 --> 01:30.710
but if I say “Please take your attention inside”,

01:30.910 --> 01:32.910
you’ll say “How? Mother it’s impossible."

01:33.150 --> 01:35.910
'How do we take our attention inside?”

01:36.150 --> 01:39.630
It’s only possible when something happens within you

01:39.830 --> 01:43.830
that your attention is drawn inside,

01:44.070 --> 01:46.230
then only you will come to know

01:46.430 --> 01:51.910
that you are a beautiful instrument made through ages.

01:52.230 --> 01:56.990
All these centres that are shown here represent

01:57.190 --> 02:01.830
your evolutionary process, one by one, how you evolved,

02:02.070 --> 02:04.270
through ages

02:04.470 --> 02:09.470
to this stage of evolution.

02:09.670 --> 02:15.470
And now after evolving up to the human stage,

02:15.710 --> 02:18.310
what do we have to do?

02:18.550 --> 02:22.870
So we come to right conclusions about ourselves first of all,

02:23.070 --> 02:26.430
that we have to become something more,

02:26.630 --> 02:29.630
something has to happen to us.

02:29.910 --> 02:32.150
Now so far in our evolution

02:32.470 --> 02:36.630
whatever has happened, has happened in our awareness,

02:36.830 --> 02:39.070
in Sanskrit called 'cheytana';

02:39.310 --> 02:45.990
means, a horse can go through a dirty lane,

02:46.230 --> 02:48.550
a dog can go through a dirty lane,

02:48.790 --> 02:51.990
but a human being cannot, he just can’t bear it.

02:52.230 --> 02:54.270
He’ll vomit, he’ll refuse,

02:54.470 --> 02:59.230
he'll not accept at any cost to pass through something very filthy.

02:59.510 --> 03:04.870
So our awareness towards dirt, filth, towards beauty,

03:05.070 --> 03:08.910
has definitely got a new dimension.

03:09.190 --> 03:13.950
And this new dimension that we have got is not sufficient enough

03:14.150 --> 03:18.190
because still we have not understood why are we here,

03:18.390 --> 03:20.750
why all this has been done

03:20.950 --> 03:26.150
to create us into such a beautiful personality,

03:26.470 --> 03:29.470
what is the purpose of this creation.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.150
And in this confusion only,

03:32.390 --> 03:37.950
we really fall into the traps of not understanding

03:38.150 --> 03:40.910
that there must be some power that does it.

03:41.150 --> 03:44.710
It is very easy to deny the power of God

03:44.990 --> 03:47.990
because who is there to challenge it?

03:48.190 --> 03:50.830
Or who is going to say that "How dare you deny?"

03:51.070 --> 03:55.110
Supposing you have a policeman, he is elected by you,

03:55.310 --> 03:59.950
so you cannot overthrow him, or you have to listen to him.

04:00.150 --> 04:02.550
But God is not elected by you,

04:02.790 --> 04:04.790
He is appointed by Himself.

04:04.990 --> 04:09.790
So as He is there you can always say whatever you like about Him.

04:10.070 --> 04:14.150
But the same thing is to understand

04:14.390 --> 04:19.470
that actually human beings don't do any work which is living.

04:19.670 --> 04:24.550
We cannot transform one flower into a fruit.

04:24.750 --> 04:26.590
Even one.

04:26.790 --> 04:30.910
What we do is to take some dead things, make buildings,

04:31.150 --> 04:35.310
make beautiful furniture, make these carpets, all manmade,

04:35.550 --> 04:40.950
every sort of thing, and then we start thinking, “Oh, we are great”.

04:41.150 --> 04:46.230
Even the science can only find whatever is available

04:46.510 --> 04:50.550
or can be seen through these eyes or felt through these senses.

04:50.830 --> 04:54.590
It cannot go beyond it, and even if it sometimes goes,

04:54.790 --> 04:58.910
like the auras and all that they see, they cannot explain it.

04:59.150 --> 05:03.630
For example if, if there is any doctor they will understand

05:03.950 --> 05:06.270
that doctors are honest on this point,

05:06.470 --> 05:10.310
that acetylene and adrenaline,

05:10.550 --> 05:12.790
acetylcholine and adrenaline,

05:12.990 --> 05:17.990
two chemicals - which are chemicals, just chemicals -

05:18.230 --> 05:21.470
react differently in the body,

05:21.790 --> 05:24.790
and they say that the mode of action of these two,

05:24.990 --> 05:29.630
we cannot explain - why it is augmentation or why it is relaxation.

05:29.910 --> 05:35.790
They admit it. So many things we have not been able to explain.

05:36.150 --> 05:39.990
Now, if I say this is a beautiful instrument,

05:40.230 --> 05:45.070
and it is fantastic to believe that we are great,

05:45.310 --> 05:48.390
I would just give another simple example,

05:48.630 --> 05:51.790
that if you have to come to this room

05:52.030 --> 05:54.510
and there is no light, I just tell you,

05:54.710 --> 05:57.990
"All right, push that button and you will get lights everywhere".

05:58.230 --> 06:00.310
Now it happens! It becomes a fantastic thing

06:00.510 --> 06:02.790
for a person who has never seen electricity,

06:02.990 --> 06:05.670
who has never known anything, who has no knowledge of electricity,

06:05.870 --> 06:08.470
that only you press one button and you get it.

06:08.670 --> 06:11.150
But behind all this organism,

06:11.350 --> 06:14.790
behind all this working, all that is done,

06:14.990 --> 06:17.230
there is a big history.

06:17.430 --> 06:20.990
There are lots of people who have worked to achieve this.

06:21.230 --> 06:24.310
People have sacrificed so much to achieve this,

06:24.550 --> 06:26.710
but we are taking the benefit of that

06:26.910 --> 06:28.670
as today we are enjoying electricity.

06:28.870 --> 06:32.470
How many people must have died discovering it?

06:32.870 --> 06:35.790
How many people must have sacrificed their life

06:35.990 --> 06:40.310
for discovering the use of it for the masses?

06:40.590 --> 06:44.310
In the same way we must understand that

06:44.550 --> 06:49.550
maybe that we are something fantastic, reach a conclusion

06:49.790 --> 06:53.550
that we have to just feel it.

06:53.950 --> 06:58.070
And unless and until you feel that greatness within you,

06:58.310 --> 07:02.630
you should not just deny that you can achieve it.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.270
You have to achieve it!

07:04.510 --> 07:06.550
Actually, if you do not achieve it

07:06.790 --> 07:09.910
you will fall short of your evolution.

07:10.110 --> 07:12.150
Today in the world if you see,

07:12.350 --> 07:16.790
everywhere I go there are so many seekers, so many seekers!

07:16.990 --> 07:20.230
Such a time was never there before, say about fifty years back

07:20.470 --> 07:22.630
we did not know the word “seekers”.

07:22.830 --> 07:24.830
People did not believe that there are seekers,

07:25.030 --> 07:28.630
but today you find so many seekers all over the world.

07:28.830 --> 07:31.830
They have gone to all kinds of other alternative things,

07:32.070 --> 07:35.710
they have tried to find out if they can find truth

07:35.990 --> 07:39.990
by altering their lives, by doing this or by doing that.

07:40.230 --> 07:44.430
The reason is, they are not at all satisfied with what they see.

07:44.630 --> 07:48.230
They are intelligent enough to see that it’s not the end

07:48.430 --> 07:52.630
of our lives and we don’t live just for insurances.

07:53.070 --> 07:55.910
Now, then one starts thinking

07:56.150 --> 07:58.310
that if these are the seekers in this world,

07:58.550 --> 08:01.990
why so many have come on this earth?

08:02.230 --> 08:05.070
This is a special time, already predicted

08:05.310 --> 08:07.790
thousands and thousands of years back.

08:08.030 --> 08:12.630
In every kind of prediction they have talked about it.

08:12.990 --> 08:15.710
There was a book called 'Nadi Granth', written

08:15.910 --> 08:18.430
you can’t say how many years back, but was revised

08:18.630 --> 08:22.910
only three hundred years back by another person called Bhujander.

08:23.150 --> 08:25.790
Now this Nadi Granth is written by a person

08:25.990 --> 08:31.230
who is actually the starting point of astrology in India,

08:31.470 --> 08:35.470
the one who started. The whole astrology has been started from India

08:35.710 --> 08:37.830
and this is the man, Bhrigu, who did it.

08:38.030 --> 08:41.710
And he wrote this Nadi Granth in which he has described -

08:41.910 --> 08:45.110
according to him, he said it in Sanskrit language

08:45.310 --> 08:48.830
but was again translated and brought to up to date level,

08:49.070 --> 08:52.790
that in 1970 something will happen,

08:52.990 --> 08:56.630
a personality will come on this earth who will

08:56.910 --> 09:01.390
give realization to thousands of people by a sahaja method.

09:01.710 --> 09:04.830
It’s clearly written down, you’ll be amazed to know that it is so,

09:05.030 --> 09:06.470
because we have a book,

09:06.670 --> 09:09.390
in that book all these prophecies are written.

09:09.630 --> 09:12.590
And what will happen? The Kundalini will rise

09:12.910 --> 09:14.990
and people will get their realization.

09:15.230 --> 09:18.150
To Indians, Kundalini is not a new knowledge.

09:18.390 --> 09:22.630
Of course, there are some people who went from

09:22.830 --> 09:28.070
other countries and tried to study about Kundalini.

09:28.310 --> 09:31.190
Now when such people come to India

09:31.390 --> 09:33.630
they do not reach the roots at all.

09:33.830 --> 09:37.030
They are just caught up by people who want to make money out of them

09:37.230 --> 09:38.750
or to mislead them.

09:38.990 --> 09:41.990
It’s a big market there for all such things.

09:42.230 --> 09:44.270
And now when these people also came,

09:44.470 --> 09:47.430
specially the Germans, when they came to India,

09:47.630 --> 09:49.990
they were caught up into such mess

09:50.230 --> 09:52.910
and they were given books which were nothing but

09:53.150 --> 09:56.310
just the opposite of what Kundalini is.

09:56.550 --> 10:01.230
It’s about the people who are doing tantrism.

10:01.470 --> 10:05.710
And tantrism is a system in which people do anti-God activity.

10:05.990 --> 10:08.590
With anti-God activity you get all kinds of

10:08.870 --> 10:12.270
horrible experiences of God and the Kundalini,

10:12.470 --> 10:13.990
and they have described all of them,

10:14.190 --> 10:18.470
as if they are the real effects of Kundalini.

10:18.710 --> 10:22.150
It's like the knowledge of a naive villager coming

10:22.390 --> 10:27.110
and putting his hand into the holes of a plug

10:27.310 --> 10:30.830
and saying that electricity gives you a big shock.

10:31.070 --> 10:32.950
So, it is even worse than that

10:33.150 --> 10:35.470
because Kundalini never gives you trouble.

10:35.670 --> 10:37.430
She is your mother.

10:37.630 --> 10:40.470
She is settled down here in the triangular bone, as you see,

10:40.710 --> 10:42.630
is called as 'sacrum'.

10:42.910 --> 10:47.910
Now this sacrum bone is - sacrum means sacred.

10:48.150 --> 10:49.790
And when I ask people,

10:49.990 --> 10:55.630
that how is it that this bone is called as sacred in Greek?

10:55.910 --> 10:57.990
When I went to Greece I asked the people,

10:58.230 --> 11:00.110
“Why do you call this a sacrum?”

11:00.310 --> 11:03.550
Then they told Me that they had a report long time back,

11:03.790 --> 11:07.030
before Alexander went to India,

11:07.230 --> 11:10.550
and there was a report between Indo-Aryan groups

11:10.790 --> 11:13.790
and they told that this bone should be called as 'sacrum'.

11:13.990 --> 11:15.790
Now imagine that this bone specially

11:15.990 --> 11:18.630
should be called as sacrum and no other bone.

11:18.830 --> 11:23.150
So this bone has got this three and a half coiled energy,

11:23.390 --> 11:25.310
settled down inside there.

11:25.550 --> 11:27.830
Now, some of these books that I’ve read,

11:28.070 --> 11:29.910
such big books written on Kundalini -

11:30.110 --> 11:32.990
some of them say the Kundalini is here, somebody says in the nose,

11:33.230 --> 11:34.630
somebody says somewhere else -

11:34.910 --> 11:39.470
means they are just, just using the ignorance of people

11:39.710 --> 11:43.150
to print something, write something, and just mislead them,

11:43.350 --> 11:45.150
to make some money out of these books.

11:45.390 --> 11:47.550
So far I’ve not written any book.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.550
I am sorry, I’ve not yet done any of that work so far.

11:50.790 --> 11:52.830
But anything can be written in the book.

11:53.030 --> 11:55.110
Whatever is written in the book is not the truth

11:55.350 --> 11:56.870
and you should not accept it.

11:57.070 --> 11:58.910
How much does it take to print a book?

11:59.150 --> 12:01.630
You people are living in such an advanced country.

12:01.910 --> 12:05.070
You know it hardly takes anything to write a book about anything,

12:05.310 --> 12:07.390
especially about God and His work.

12:07.630 --> 12:11.630
Because even, you'll be amazed that Hitler used to talk about God,

12:11.910 --> 12:13.750
Napoleon used to talk about God.

12:13.950 --> 12:16.070
All these horrible people used to talk about God,

12:16.310 --> 12:19.270
and sometimes they believed that God was in their favour

12:19.470 --> 12:22.990
because they thought they were rather successful.

12:23.390 --> 12:27.910
Now, these books or whatever they have told you, is not true.

12:28.150 --> 12:32.790
This is the truth, that the Kundalini lies in your sacred bone,

12:32.990 --> 12:34.630
called sacrum.

12:34.910 --> 12:38.430
You can see the pulsation of the Kundalini at the time

12:38.630 --> 12:41.910
when the Kundalini is raised. Not in everyone,

12:42.110 --> 12:44.150
if you have got a blockage

12:44.390 --> 12:46.430
in that another center that is there,

12:46.630 --> 12:50.070
or the upper, this centre, then this Kundalini - because

12:50.310 --> 12:55.630
this is the pure desire of becoming one with God.

12:55.990 --> 12:59.150
This is the purest desire which you have

12:59.350 --> 13:04.710
and when it is awakened it makes an effort, a tremendous effort.

13:04.990 --> 13:10.070
But I have seen some people have Kundalinis which are just hurt,

13:10.310 --> 13:16.150
like a beaten up snake, you see, it just tosses.

13:16.390 --> 13:19.830
It tosses itself on all the sides and tries to get out

13:20.070 --> 13:23.390
but it cannot because the gentleman or the seeker

13:23.630 --> 13:26.470
who has got this Kundalini within himself, his own mother,

13:26.670 --> 13:30.030
has hurt Her so much that She cannot raise her head,

13:30.230 --> 13:35.790
she is very tired and she wants the supply of pure energy to rise.

13:36.150 --> 13:41.270
So when people are here I have to tell you one thing, that

13:41.550 --> 13:45.550
it’s nice that you have come for realization, you should take it.

13:45.870 --> 13:48.790
But you can’t demand it, you can’t demand it.

13:48.990 --> 13:52.430
For today I found one gentleman was just shaking before Me like this.

13:52.630 --> 13:56.230
All the time. So he said, “Why am I shaking before You?”

13:56.430 --> 14:00.630
I said, “Because your nerves are out. You are a nervous person.

14:00.910 --> 14:03.070
That’s why you are shaking. All your nerves are out,

14:03.310 --> 14:06.150
I have to steady them, otherwise the Kundalini won’t rise

14:06.350 --> 14:08.310
and you won’t feel the cool breeze,

14:08.510 --> 14:12.550
because Kundalini is now attending to those nerve centers

14:12.790 --> 14:15.790
which are absolutely overdone.

14:15.990 --> 14:18.270
They are absolutely fagged out and tired."

14:18.470 --> 14:20.630
He is a young man, about twenty five years,

14:20.830 --> 14:23.830
I am an old woman, but I said, “Look at my hands, are not shaking.

14:24.070 --> 14:26.230
Why should your hands shake like an old man

14:26.470 --> 14:28.550
of eighty years all the time? You must think about it."

14:28.790 --> 14:31.630
Why should they think it should happen?

14:31.910 --> 14:38.110
So this is what it is, that some people get it.

14:38.310 --> 14:41.550
Most of them get it. But some cannot get it.

14:41.790 --> 14:44.310
Now the attitude should be little different

14:44.550 --> 14:47.150
from what you have towards anybody else.

14:47.390 --> 14:51.070
Here you have to get something out of Me.

14:51.310 --> 14:53.990
You have to make use of Me.

14:54.230 --> 14:58.230
Not that I have to use you for any purpose whatsoever.

14:58.470 --> 15:03.070
It should be clear cut that you are asking for something.

15:03.310 --> 15:06.230
You deserve it, no doubt!

15:06.470 --> 15:08.630
It’s like you go to the bank, all right,

15:08.830 --> 15:10.470
there’s a banker sitting there.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.270
If you have some money in the bank,

15:12.470 --> 15:15.030
you can go and talk to him but you can’t be rude with the banker.

15:15.230 --> 15:17.710
You have to say, "All right, I have got this money with you,

15:17.910 --> 15:19.230
please may I have?”

15:19.430 --> 15:21.790
Now the Grace of God is so gracious,

15:21.990 --> 15:24.230
that it gives you manifold much more

15:24.470 --> 15:27.150
than what you have really reserved in the bank.

15:27.350 --> 15:29.350
I can see that working out so well.

15:29.550 --> 15:33.790
So we have to understand that we are made in our own glory,

15:33.990 --> 15:36.550
God has made us a fantastic thing,

15:36.790 --> 15:41.630
we are a great instrument that has to receive it's blessings.

15:41.830 --> 15:44.910
And as this instrument is put to the mains,

15:45.110 --> 15:46.870
once you put to your mains,

15:47.070 --> 15:50.990
you will be surprised how fantastic you are.

15:51.310 --> 15:55.310
It’s amazing how people are not aware of themselves.

15:55.550 --> 15:58.190
It is amazing how people do not know,

15:58.390 --> 16:00.630
how precious they are to the Divine.

16:00.910 --> 16:04.910
Human beings are the epitome of this creation.

16:05.150 --> 16:08.470
Forget the moon, forget the sun, forget this earth,

16:08.710 --> 16:11.630
everything is nothing, it’s at your feet.

16:11.910 --> 16:14.310
You are the highest that God has created

16:14.550 --> 16:17.230
and the way we fritter away our life for nothing at all,

16:17.470 --> 16:21.150
for superficial things, is something very, very surprising.

16:21.390 --> 16:25.990
We are not at all aware that how much the nature has worked for us,

16:26.190 --> 16:27.790
to make us human beings.

16:27.990 --> 16:31.630
And once you realize that you are the Spirit -

16:31.910 --> 16:33.150
realize doesn’t mean

16:33.350 --> 16:36.630
that you just realize it through a mental process,

16:36.910 --> 16:41.230
it is a happening within you, which takes place. You become that!

16:41.470 --> 16:45.270
And once you become that, you’ll be amazed

16:45.470 --> 16:50.630
that your becoming will prove that you are really the epitome,

16:50.870 --> 16:53.790
you are the meaning, you are everything

16:53.990 --> 16:57.910
and without you, the creation has no meaning at all.

16:58.230 --> 17:01.790
It’s like a tree which has now the flowers,

17:01.990 --> 17:03.710
and they have to become the fruits,

17:03.910 --> 17:06.390
otherwise the tree has no meaning at all.

17:06.710 --> 17:12.150
But whatever we do mentally is artificial.

17:12.470 --> 17:16.790
Because it has no roots attached to it,

17:16.990 --> 17:19.150
it has no moorings to it.

17:19.430 --> 17:24.230
Now your, say your politics or your economics, all is artificial.

17:24.510 --> 17:27.390
But in that also you can find a lot of truth.

17:27.670 --> 17:32.230
For example, economics says that wants in general are not satiable.

17:32.470 --> 17:34.510
Individual wants can be satisfied,

17:34.710 --> 17:36.750
but wants in general are not satiable,

17:36.950 --> 17:41.070
means this matter cannot give us satisfaction.

17:41.310 --> 17:44.190
If it could then we would have been satisfied with one thing,

17:44.390 --> 17:47.150
but we buy one thing, then we buy, want to buy another thing

17:47.390 --> 17:49.790
and then we want to buy another thing and still we are

17:49.990 --> 17:54.790
the most dissatisfied souls ever living on this earth.

17:54.990 --> 17:59.510
Now economics another, then politics we can see,

17:59.710 --> 18:04.630
is that people talk of say, communism, they talk of socialism,

18:04.910 --> 18:08.150
they talk of democracy, of capitalism.

18:08.390 --> 18:12.230
It's also artificial to Me, it's just a play of human beings.

18:12.470 --> 18:17.910
Because when you say you are a capitalist - what is your capital?

18:18.150 --> 18:20.630
This you can’t take with you. It's of no use.

18:20.910 --> 18:23.230
You don’t want to share it. What's the use of such a capital?

18:23.430 --> 18:25.430
While I would say I am a capitalist

18:25.630 --> 18:27.790
because I have all the powers within Myself.

18:28.070 --> 18:29.430
And I am the greatest communist

18:29.630 --> 18:32.910
because I can't live without sharing it. I just can’t help it.

18:33.150 --> 18:34.510
You see, people can’t understand Me.

18:34.710 --> 18:36.630
They think, "You are a nicely married lady,

18:36.910 --> 18:40.470
your husband is such a nice person, is such a nice gentleman,

18:40.670 --> 18:42.870
he loves you so much, he cares for you so much.

18:43.070 --> 18:46.190
You are a grandmother,you are a mother and why are You doing all this

18:46.390 --> 18:48.550
and running about everywhere, talking to people?

18:48.790 --> 18:52.710
They can’t understand this communism which is so important to Me

18:52.910 --> 18:56.630
that I cannot get My joy without sharing it with others.

18:56.830 --> 19:01.150
It's something which people have to gradually take in

19:01.390 --> 19:03.630
and once they take in, they become themselves.

19:03.830 --> 19:07.550
It’s my job that I have to give you what you have.

19:07.790 --> 19:10.910
It’s your own. I do not do anything about it,

19:11.150 --> 19:13.230
it's your own. All you are built in that way.

19:13.470 --> 19:16.990
Only thing what I do, like a candle which is enlightened

19:17.230 --> 19:20.550
can enlighten any other candle, which is ready.

19:20.870 --> 19:23.150
But some people will escape saying, “I’m not ready”.

19:23.350 --> 19:25.790
Now, you let Me find out if you are ready or not.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.190
That’s another side of it.

19:27.390 --> 19:29.990
“Mother, we are sinners, we are not ready.”

19:30.230 --> 19:32.110
Now you let Me do the job for you.

19:32.310 --> 19:34.030
I may be able to put the candle right.

19:34.230 --> 19:37.630
Why do you condemn yourself? This is the other side of it.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.830
Sometimes people get into ego moods

19:40.070 --> 19:42.310
and sometimes they get into such a superego mood

19:42.550 --> 19:45.630
that they say,” Mother, oh we are no good, we are sinners,

19:45.830 --> 19:48.390
we have done this, we have done that.” Now forget it!

19:48.630 --> 19:51.790
If I don’t know the job then I better not do it.

19:51.990 --> 19:53.870
But I think I know it, I have done it.

19:54.070 --> 19:57.910
So let Me do it, and let us see if I can give what you have.

19:58.150 --> 20:01.710
Because that is supposed to be God’s promise, that

20:01.910 --> 20:04.270
you have to get your resurrection,

20:04.470 --> 20:08.150
that you have to become self-realized, that you are to be born again

20:08.390 --> 20:11.110
and all this has been done within you with this aim

20:11.310 --> 20:12.670
and is not to be wasted.

20:12.870 --> 20:15.550
I don’t know how many in Melbourne are going to get it.

20:15.750 --> 20:18.910
How many are going to get it in Sydney, that’s besides the point.

20:19.150 --> 20:22.230
It depends on how much you care for yourself.

20:22.470 --> 20:26.630
But wherever I go I will try my level best to do it.

20:26.870 --> 20:29.950
Now, how I cure people and what happens -

20:30.150 --> 20:33.110
actually curing is not at all My job,

20:33.310 --> 20:36.190
it's just a by-product by which you get cured completely.

20:36.390 --> 20:41.190
Because once you get your absolute and you get to the source

20:41.390 --> 20:45.630
which is all pervading, which starts flowing through you,

20:45.910 --> 20:47.990
then your problem is solved.

20:48.230 --> 20:50.830
You never get exhausted, you never get upset.

20:51.070 --> 20:53.870
It’s all solved. The whole energy works it out.

20:54.070 --> 20:56.150
So the compassion that people talk of

20:56.390 --> 20:57.870
that we are very compassionate

20:58.070 --> 21:01.390
and we are very peace loving and all that, is so superficial.

21:01.630 --> 21:03.790
This is the compassion that it works.

21:03.990 --> 21:07.150
It works, it doesn’t talk, it just works.

21:07.390 --> 21:09.470
This is the peace that exists,

21:09.710 --> 21:13.230
that you feel is expressed within you and without.

21:13.470 --> 21:14.910
A person of that calibre

21:15.110 --> 21:18.150
if he stays with other people who are turbulent,

21:18.350 --> 21:21.830
who are volcanic, who are violent,

21:22.070 --> 21:26.550
they become peaceful. It works.  That’s what it is.

21:26.830 --> 21:32.310
You must know that whatever people are saying to you, it must work.

21:32.550 --> 21:35.630
Like going to other gurus, to other people,

21:35.830 --> 21:39.710
you should know that it has not given you any power of your own.

21:39.910 --> 21:41.910
Leave alone whatever they have to say about Me,

21:42.150 --> 21:44.150
I am this, I am that, I am that. Forget it.

21:44.390 --> 21:48.070
What I am saying, what are you?

21:48.310 --> 21:51.550
You have to receive your own significance.

21:51.790 --> 21:54.390
You have to understand your own meaning

21:54.590 --> 21:57.190
and if it works in you then it’s all right.

21:57.390 --> 22:01.630
That’s what you should ask anyone if you go to and say that

22:01.910 --> 22:05.310
“Can you give me my own powers, not your powers?”

22:05.550 --> 22:07.990
You may be very great and you might be doing something.

22:08.230 --> 22:10.710
But people are so ridiculously superficial,

22:10.910 --> 22:14.470
so ridiculously superficial that a person if he buys

22:14.710 --> 22:18.430
fifty-eight Rolls Royce out of the money of loots that they have,

22:18.630 --> 22:21.430
out of these people who go to them,

22:21.630 --> 22:24.150
we think “Oh, he has fifty-eight Rolls Royce.”

22:24.390 --> 22:27.390
He, such a man can impress these English

22:27.630 --> 22:29.670
who could not be impressed by anything else,

22:29.870 --> 22:33.190
if he has a big cavalcade or a big procession

22:33.390 --> 22:38.550
of these fifty-eight looted Rolls Royce on the road,

22:38.790 --> 22:40.710
then people say, “Oh! what a guru he is,

22:40.910 --> 22:43.470
he’s got fifty-eight Rolls Royce.”

22:43.750 --> 22:47.550
Yes, you won’t believe, and he wanted to have the fifty-ninth one.

22:47.790 --> 22:49.110
And he went away to America.

22:49.310 --> 22:50.430
And he wrote a letter saying that

22:50.630 --> 22:52.230
"If you give me the fifty-ninth I’ll come".

22:52.470 --> 22:54.750
The poor boys, you see,

22:54.950 --> 22:58.830
they suffered, they ate only potatoes, they starved themselves.

22:59.070 --> 23:01.710
They have - they are fifty thousand still in U.K.,

23:01.910 --> 23:05.110
absolutely cabbages, lost people, absolutely lost.

23:05.310 --> 23:07.870
You can’t talk to them. They shake when you go before them.

23:08.070 --> 23:10.470
They can’t understand, it is all finished there,

23:10.670 --> 23:12.790
nothing, they are all lost people.

23:13.070 --> 23:15.470
And if you go and tell them “How can you

23:15.750 --> 23:19.390
get a Rolls Royce for a sadhu? He's a sanyasi, he says.

23:19.590 --> 23:21.590
How can you give him a Rolls Royce?”

23:21.790 --> 23:25.270
So they say, “We have got the Spirit”,

23:25.470 --> 23:27.990
means some spirit has possessed them, you see,

23:28.230 --> 23:31.830
“We have got the Spirit and we have to give just metal.

23:32.070 --> 23:33.630
What is in Rolls Royce? Is metal."

23:33.790 --> 23:37.070
But why don’t they think, why does the guru

23:37.270 --> 23:39.070
think that this metal is precious?

23:39.270 --> 23:42.350
You see, we don’t use our brains at all when you go to gurus,

23:42.550 --> 23:45.430
surprisingly. If he says, "I will make you fly".

23:45.630 --> 23:49.070
All right, at least you should ask the guru to fly.

23:49.310 --> 23:51.350
Why not make him fly and see if he can fly or not.

23:51.550 --> 23:54.150
At least minimum of minimum that he should do, isn’t it?

23:54.390 --> 23:56.750
But that also we never do, we just accept it.

23:56.950 --> 24:01.230
Because he has a big organisation and he has a big publicity,

24:01.470 --> 24:04.750
because you can pass through seven rooms to reach him and all that.

24:04.950 --> 24:08.230
He creates a feeling, and then you think “Oh, it’s great to fly”.

24:08.470 --> 24:12.310
And if somebody says that, "Go and ask that guru to fly",

24:12.510 --> 24:16.350
people don’t like it. They don’t want to hear anything about it.

24:16.550 --> 24:20.070
And then you pay thousands and thousands of pounds to them.

24:20.310 --> 24:23.910
You end up as penniless people, as epileptic people,

24:24.150 --> 24:26.470
and you can’t understand what wrong it was.

24:26.710 --> 24:29.470
You didn’t use your brains!

24:29.710 --> 24:31.790
You didn’t use your brains I would say.

24:31.990 --> 24:34.310
I know, I must condemn all these devilish people

24:34.550 --> 24:37.470
who have ruined so many seekers because they are seeking truth.

24:37.790 --> 24:40.350
They are my children, they’re my own, I know.

24:40.550 --> 24:44.710
I feel very sorry for them. You don’t know how much I want to work,

24:44.910 --> 24:47.470
that I should save all of them, but

24:47.670 --> 24:52.150
I also should tell you that this is your mistake, you misunderstand.

24:52.390 --> 24:55.150
You don’t know that you can’t pay for your realization,

24:55.390 --> 24:59.230
you can’t pay for God.

24:59.470 --> 25:01.910
Christ was bought for 30 rupees.

25:02.150 --> 25:04.910
It's a very good example to understand.

25:05.150 --> 25:08.790
He was bought to be killed.

25:08.990 --> 25:12.470
Another example is that when people were selling some things

25:12.670 --> 25:17.310
in the temple, He took a big whip and whipped them,

25:17.550 --> 25:21.270
absolutely in a great temper. Who said on the cross, that

25:21.470 --> 25:24.990
“Please God forgive them for they do not know what they are doing.”

25:25.230 --> 25:30.790
But now it is so sad that if you do like that

25:31.070 --> 25:33.150
you won’t be able to forgive yourself.

25:33.390 --> 25:36.150
Christ maybe, but you may not be able to forgive yourself

25:36.390 --> 25:41.830
for doing all these mistakes and committing such horrible injuries

25:42.070 --> 25:46.310
upon yourself and troubling your Kundalini to that extent.

25:46.550 --> 25:52.390
This Self-realization you have been seeking for ages, many lives.

25:52.630 --> 25:55.870
You have been seekers for many lives and the time has come,

25:56.070 --> 26:00.790
this great time of resurrection, the great time of your judgement.

26:00.990 --> 26:04.470
At this time you should take it, take it up

26:04.670 --> 26:08.710
that you have to be self-realized! Only this is my message to you.

26:08.910 --> 26:13.990
I hope you will understand it. May God bless you.

26:14.310 --> 26:16.630
I would like you to ask Me some questions

26:16.910 --> 26:20.030
because today is the first day. But ask relevant questions.

26:20.230 --> 26:23.870
Some people, you see, just ask questions just to show off.

26:24.070 --> 26:26.270
Then I would say they should take another hall

26:26.470 --> 26:30.990
to give a lecture there. But normally -

26:31.230 --> 26:33.870
yes, some people start giving another lecture to Me, you see,

26:34.070 --> 26:36.310
and instead of My lecture, I have to listen to their lecture,

26:36.550 --> 26:38.350
which has no relevance to it, you see.

26:38.550 --> 26:43.110
So I would request you not to waste others’ time. Be civil to them,

26:43.310 --> 26:47.070
and ask questions which are relevant to the subject.

26:47.310 --> 26:49.990
Thank you very much.

27:03.230 --> 27:05.910
Right. Any questions?

27:06.310 --> 27:08.550
Each night Mataji is going to be speaking here.

27:08.790 --> 27:12.470
Keep the cane on one side.

27:15.550 --> 27:17.550
Each night Mataji is going to be speaking here.

27:17.790 --> 27:20.350
She’ll be talking tomorrow night about

27:20.550 --> 27:24.150
the centers that lie up to the heart,

27:24.350 --> 27:27.790
and the next night the centers that lie to the Sahasrara,

27:27.990 --> 27:31.710
in particular the chakra of the Sahasrara.

27:31.910 --> 27:37.150
So, any particular questions about the individual centers within us,

27:37.390 --> 27:41.390
We can ask tomorrow.
she’ll be explaining on a day-by-day basis.

27:41.630 --> 27:44.830
So any questions thus far?

27:45.550 --> 27:49.790
I'd like to know if having a vertebrae in the spine out of place

27:50.270 --> 27:53.550
interferes with the rising of the Kundalini?

27:53.750 --> 27:56.030
Does having a vertebrae out of place in the spine

27:56.270 --> 27:58.390
interfere with the rising of Kundalini?

27:58.590 --> 28:00.830
It does to some extent, it does.

28:01.070 --> 28:03.070
Definitely it does, but we can put it right.

28:03.310 --> 28:06.070
The vertebrae can be put right and the Kundalini can be brought in.

28:06.270 --> 28:08.990
It does. So many things do happen, if you have -

28:09.230 --> 28:11.190
you are a person over read;

28:11.390 --> 28:13.790
if you have read too many books and the books are in your head,

28:13.990 --> 28:17.070
I have to empty that also.

28:20.030 --> 28:24.150
I actually do this work as a profession and I find that

28:24.390 --> 28:29.550
if the subtle center is fixed, the spinal problems just disappear.

28:29.830 --> 28:32.830
I used to have three and four adjustments a week,

28:33.070 --> 28:36.150
to correct my spine and now I have none at all.

28:36.390 --> 28:40.630
So first fix the subtle within us and then the gross part,

28:40.830 --> 28:44.990
the spinal misalignments and so on, will just get better.

28:48.990 --> 28:51.070
Any others?

28:55.830 --> 28:58.870
May I ask another question?
Yes.

29:02.470 --> 29:07.790
Do you feel that there can be a difference between, in marriage,

29:08.070 --> 29:13.470
that people can be married on earth, in a seemingly holiness,

29:14.150 --> 29:17.310
that there is really a difference in a marriage of souls,

29:17.630 --> 29:22.070
than there is in many marriages, so-called marriages.

29:23.190 --> 29:24.990
[...]

29:25.230 --> 29:31.070
I’m not too sure, but, earthly marriages which seem to be ok,

29:31.310 --> 29:34.630
but - did you saying a mismarriage of souls?

29:34.910 --> 29:38.390
Perhaps, but maybe there is some sort of

29:38.630 --> 29:42.310
mismarriage in some way of souls of those same people.

29:42.630 --> 29:46.470
Can there be a perfectly “normal” - as we call it, earthly marriage,

29:46.790 --> 29:52.990
and perhaps a mismarriage of souls, in a heavenly sense?

29:53.310 --> 29:57.550
You see the Spirit in every being is perfect.

29:57.830 --> 30:01.830
Everybody’s Spirit is perfect. There’s no imperfection with it.

30:02.110 --> 30:06.550
But some people have a more reflection of the Spirit

30:06.790 --> 30:09.990
in their character, and some people don’t have.

30:10.310 --> 30:18.150
They have more darkness and more we can say,

30:18.510 --> 30:21.630
outward look or materialistic you can call them,

30:21.910 --> 30:24.630
or you can call them, they are over-romantic type,

30:24.830 --> 30:28.710
any sort of thing which is outside. But doesn’t matter.

30:28.910 --> 30:32.110
We have seen people who have been married before,

30:32.310 --> 30:34.150
they said they are mal-adjusted.

30:34.430 --> 30:39.230
I would say ninety percent such marriages are now doing well.

30:39.550 --> 30:42.550
But maybe, there could be terrible difference also

30:42.790 --> 30:45.550
between the two persons, as you say. It's possible.

30:45.830 --> 30:49.630
But that is to be seen. Just now you should not worry about it.

30:49.830 --> 30:53.070
If there is any mal-adjustment, it might be put right.

30:53.310 --> 30:54.910
If it doesn’t work out

30:55.110 --> 30:59.390
then you have to work out the correction as far as possible.

30:59.670 --> 31:01.990
See it is said 'Karmanye vadhikaraste',

31:02.230 --> 31:04.670
is that with which we can do the work.

31:04.990 --> 31:07.390
We can work it out as far as possible.

31:07.630 --> 31:11.230
But if it doesn’t work, forget it. That’s it.

31:11.430 --> 31:14.230
But once you are a realised soul,

31:14.430 --> 31:18.910
you become so congenial, so tolerant, so understanding.

31:19.150 --> 31:22.830
Actually your being itself corrects the other person.

31:23.110 --> 31:26.390
But maybe some people can be such gone cases,

31:26.630 --> 31:29.630
that whatever you may try they may not come back.

31:29.910 --> 31:32.710
So it's not important to worry about those things.

31:32.990 --> 31:35.070
We’ll see later on how the thing is

31:35.270 --> 31:38.990
and how it has to be worked out, all right?

31:39.790 --> 31:43.910
Could You please explain more about the realization process

31:44.150 --> 31:46.390
when it comes out of the top of your head.

31:46.670 --> 31:49.710
Could You explain Self-realization, and in particular

31:49.910 --> 31:51.550
how it manifests on your hands

31:51.790 --> 31:54.710
and how it comes out of the top of your head.

31:54.990 --> 31:57.710
It just comes out.

31:59.870 --> 32:01.950
You see, how will you explain

32:02.150 --> 32:06.150
how does a primule or the germ of a seed comes out?

32:06.390 --> 32:08.870
It’s like that, it’s a living process as I said.

32:09.070 --> 32:13.150
The Kundalini rises and when She enlightens all other centers

32:13.390 --> 32:16.550
She passes through them and then when She comes up here,

32:16.830 --> 32:20.550
at this point, this point is very important in human beings,

32:20.790 --> 32:24.430
is bestowed or, we can say the -

32:24.670 --> 32:28.870
it is governed by the deity of Lord Jesus Christ.

32:29.070 --> 32:33.910
And He sucks in these two institutions called ego and super-ego.

32:34.150 --> 32:37.630
By that there’s an opening made and the Kundalini just

32:37.830 --> 32:40.990
jets out and you can feel it coming out of your head.

32:41.190 --> 32:45.470
This is the actualisation of baptism. It’s not something artificial,

32:45.710 --> 32:49.510
that you take water and put it on somebody’s head and say that

32:49.710 --> 32:55.710
"you are baptised" and hear the child is screaming with that baptism.

32:57.070 --> 33:02.230
So it’s an actualisation, it’s a living process, how it works.

33:02.630 --> 33:08.310
But while rising of course lots of things happen, like the

33:08.550 --> 33:13.550
chakras go into various moods, they try to sustain the Kundalini,

33:13.790 --> 33:17.230
they try to keep it there. All these things happen.

33:17.510 --> 33:22.990
These happen when the Kundalini is awakened, not before that.

33:23.390 --> 33:26.310
That’s why, like somebody talks of Raja Yoga,

33:26.550 --> 33:30.030
that you cut your tongue, push it back and do the 'kechari'

33:30.230 --> 33:34.150
and by that you can raise your Kundalini. And it is absurd, you see.

33:34.390 --> 33:36.190
Like the car has not started,

33:36.390 --> 33:39.310
so you move the wheels and the car will start.

33:39.550 --> 33:41.190
But when the Kundalini is rising,

33:41.390 --> 33:43.990
this tongue is little bit pulled inside no doubt,

33:44.190 --> 33:45.710
automatically. You don’t feel it also.

33:45.910 --> 33:48.390
Slightly it is pulled inside and is released again.

33:48.630 --> 33:50.870
But by cutting this tongue and putting it back

33:51.070 --> 33:52.390
do you think the Kundalini will rise?

33:52.630 --> 33:54.910
It's so superficial, it’s so artificial.

33:55.110 --> 33:56.910
And that’s how they have done all these things.

33:57.110 --> 33:59.950
Even now, for example Hatha Yoga that we do,

34:00.150 --> 34:02.030
is -of course Hatha Yoga is ashtanga,

34:02.230 --> 34:05.630
it is not only one that we call as yoga, is standing on your head,

34:05.790 --> 34:07.790
It's not the only thing. It is ashtanga.

34:07.990 --> 34:10.310
There are eight things and in that also, 'Ishvara pranidhana',

34:10.510 --> 34:13.830
means the establishment of God, is the first thing.

34:14.070 --> 34:16.430
Because before the Kundalini has started

34:16.630 --> 34:20.310
if you start doing any exercises, you may be harming yourself.

34:20.510 --> 34:22.430
Because you don’t know where is the problem.

34:22.630 --> 34:24.110
Supposing you have a problem in the stomach

34:24.310 --> 34:27.310
and you are doing the exercises of the nose, what’s the use?

34:27.550 --> 34:31.230
You will spoil the nose as well as the stomach is already bad.

34:31.470 --> 34:33.630
So it's very indiscriminate. It’s very scientific.

34:33.910 --> 34:36.790
The mantras are the same thing. Where to say which mantras,

34:36.990 --> 34:40.630
what chakras are catching, which deity is to be awakened,

34:40.910 --> 34:42.790
we must know all the science behind it.

34:42.990 --> 34:45.790
And everybody knows, there is no secret about it.

34:45.990 --> 34:47.870
There is not the thing you come here inside,

34:48.070 --> 34:50.950
and you will pay Me three hundred pounds and I'll give you a mantra.

34:51.150 --> 34:53.470
All right, that mantra you are not to tell anybody,

34:53.790 --> 34:55.630
because that mantra means nothing, you see.

34:55.870 --> 34:58.030
There was a fellow who paid three hundred pounds,

34:58.230 --> 35:00.350
and I asked him what was the mantra. He said “tinga”.

35:00.550 --> 35:02.550
Now if you tell an Indian he will just laugh,

35:02.790 --> 35:05.590
if he hears what it means, it means this.

35:05.870 --> 35:07.910
Can you imagine such nonsense?

35:08.110 --> 35:10.630
And don’t tell anybody! It’s a big Mafia.

35:10.910 --> 35:13.070
Don’t tell anybody, just keep quiet.

35:13.310 --> 35:17.710
If you tell anybody, then - because you have found out.

35:19.390 --> 35:23.790
So you cannot give one mantra. Is another funny idea people have

35:23.990 --> 35:26.550
that you just give one mantra to somebody.

35:26.830 --> 35:29.710
Of course, I mean if you have a problem at a particular point

35:29.910 --> 35:34.310
one can say that, "At this time you say this mantra to clear out".

35:34.550 --> 35:36.910
But then later on you don’t go on with it.

35:37.150 --> 35:41.230
Then you do the one which where you need, require. Isn’t it?

35:41.470 --> 35:44.630
I'ts simple as that. Supposing you are suffering from some trouble,

35:44.830 --> 35:46.910
we take medicine for that particular thing.

35:47.150 --> 35:49.350
And then, when we are suffering from another trouble

35:49.550 --> 35:52.550
we take another medicine for that particular thing.

35:52.790 --> 35:56.470
We don’t go on taking the same medicine, whether it is anything.

35:56.790 --> 35:58.630
So it is a very scientific knowledge,

35:58.910 --> 36:00.390
which you will pick up in no time.

36:00.630 --> 36:05.590
Eight days are sufficient to learn the whole of Sahaja Yoga.

36:05.950 --> 36:09.070
Once you get your realisation, that’s the main point is.

36:09.390 --> 36:13.790
Excuse me. Does meat eating interfere with all this?

36:14.750 --> 36:15.990
What is it?

36:16.270 --> 36:18.790
Does meat eating interfere with this process?

36:18.990 --> 36:23.070
No, not at all, not at all. But you see, you have to understand,

36:23.310 --> 36:25.630
what sort of a personality you are.

36:25.910 --> 36:29.150
If you are the right sided personality then you should not eat meat,

36:29.390 --> 36:31.830
you should take to something milder,

36:32.070 --> 36:34.870
you can, I call them grass eating, you can do.

36:35.070 --> 36:38.790
But if you have say, you are a left sided person,

36:38.990 --> 36:40.510
then you have to take meat.

36:40.710 --> 36:42.550
You see, I would say in general that

36:42.790 --> 36:45.150
Australians should not eat so much meat as they eat.

36:45.350 --> 36:49.150
They eat meat too much.They should take more vegetables.

36:49.390 --> 36:51.030
But Indians should eat some meat

36:51.230 --> 36:53.630
because otherwise they’ll become cowards.

36:53.910 --> 36:56.070
So it is what sort of a personality it is.

36:56.270 --> 36:58.230
I don’t know from where this idea has come,

36:58.430 --> 37:00.710
that vegetarianism is going to take to God.

37:00.910 --> 37:02.790
In India most of the people are vegetarians

37:02.990 --> 37:04.790
because they can’t afford it, you see.

37:04.990 --> 37:08.790
No, no, no, I don't care about that vegetarianism to take to God...

37:09.070 --> 37:12.990
Now, yes, but it is not important for everyone. What I’m saying,

37:13.230 --> 37:16.150
as it is, we have to understand, we have to be discreet,

37:16.390 --> 37:18.830
we have to understand who needs what.

37:19.070 --> 37:21.230
Everybody need not take vegetarian food.

37:21.470 --> 37:23.830
Everybody need not take non-vegetarian food.

37:24.070 --> 37:26.710
It’s the 'prakriti' they call it, nature of a person.

37:26.910 --> 37:29.870
You must find out what is the nature of the person is.

37:30.070 --> 37:33.030
If he, supposing he is suffering from high blood pressure,

37:33.230 --> 37:38.390
and other things like that, he has to take to food which is,

37:38.590 --> 37:42.950
which will control his, I mean which will give him another side;

37:43.150 --> 37:45.630
means he should stop eating meats and things like that.

37:45.910 --> 37:48.790
All right? So he, he balances himself, to balance himself.

37:49.070 --> 37:52.950
The whole food theory is to be understood through

37:53.270 --> 37:56.190
the understanding of your being first of all,

37:56.390 --> 37:57.750
what sort of a being you are,

37:57.950 --> 38:00.590
and what is lacking in you is to be supplemented.

38:00.790 --> 38:02.830
So we just can’t say that,

38:03.070 --> 38:05.470
now so many people now, and doctors if you go to them they’ll say,

38:05.710 --> 38:08.830
“Cut down your sugar”, general. But it's absurd.

38:09.070 --> 38:11.270
Sugar is very important for liver.

38:11.470 --> 38:13.830
If you don’t take sugar I don’t know what will happen to you,

38:14.070 --> 38:16.630
you will become like sticks, you see, absolutely like sticks.

38:16.910 --> 38:20.190
If those people who are right-sided,if they don’t take sugar at all,

38:20.390 --> 38:21.710
I don’t know what’s going to happen to them.

38:21.910 --> 38:24.190
They'll be very irritable, hot-tempered,

38:24.390 --> 38:27.910
absolutely stick-like people.They’ll hit you like a stick, you know.

38:28.150 --> 38:30.790
So that’s something, a general statement like that,

38:30.990 --> 38:32.910
is very dangerous, just not to have.

38:33.150 --> 38:35.110
But what is the science behind it?

38:35.310 --> 38:37.550
Carbohydrates are very important for the body,

38:37.830 --> 38:39.830
especially if you are thinking too much,

38:40.070 --> 38:42.790
if you are a futuristic person, if you are right sided,

38:42.990 --> 38:46.910
it’s absolutely essential that you must have sufficient carbohydrates.

38:47.150 --> 38:49.790
We have treated so many liver patients with sugar.

38:49.990 --> 38:52.630
So this kind of a general statement even - sorry for,

38:52.910 --> 38:55.310
I must say that doctors should not feel hurt,

38:55.550 --> 38:57.910
but is a very general statement doctors also make.

38:58.150 --> 39:00.790
No doubt about it, without going into it to find it,

39:00.990 --> 39:06.070
it’s very easy to say, “Now you all should stop sugars.” Why?

39:06.790 --> 39:09.910
Our forefathers ate sugars. They were healthier people than us,

39:10.110 --> 39:12.710
I tell you. All of us are sick now, this way or the other.

39:12.910 --> 39:15.270
If physically you are all right, mentally we are out.

39:15.470 --> 39:17.270
If we are mentally out,

39:17.470 --> 39:19.910
then we think that physically we are all right.

39:20.110 --> 39:24.830
So we have a satisfaction but I think both are just the same.

39:25.550 --> 39:28.390
So we have to be discreet in anything that we do.

39:28.630 --> 39:31.430
It cannot be a fad, it cannot be an -ism,

39:31.630 --> 39:34.270
it cannot be a hard and fast line.

39:34.470 --> 39:37.150
It's all made for you. God has made everything for you.

39:37.350 --> 39:41.550
You must understand what we should eat, what will suit us.

39:41.870 --> 39:44.110
That is to be found out on a person,

39:44.310 --> 39:46.310
what sort of a personality he is.

39:46.550 --> 39:50.070
In our Sahaja Yoga many people take to vegetables,

39:50.310 --> 39:53.350
and many people have to take to meat eating.

39:53.550 --> 39:56.030
And by that they have improved their health very much.

39:56.230 --> 39:58.550
He is one who was suffering from high blood pressure,

39:58.790 --> 40:01.750
God knows how many things. He just dropped it like that.

40:01.950 --> 40:07.310
And he keeps low on meats I think.

40:09.790 --> 40:16.390
Do You find that today many people are more sicker, not to think of

40:16.630 --> 40:22.070
they look older, seeking the health than fifty years ago and...

40:22.310 --> 40:26.430
Do you find that more people today are sicker,

40:26.630 --> 40:30.790
in general, than they were fifty years ago?

40:31.150 --> 40:32.310
No doubt.

40:32.550 --> 40:33.550
Why?

40:33.870 --> 40:35.790
Because a time has come, to see.

40:35.990 --> 40:38.790
This is the time you are born for this.

40:39.070 --> 40:42.030
Many children are born realised these days, so many children.

40:42.230 --> 40:46.270
Now we have in our ashram about nine children, very beautiful ones,

40:46.470 --> 40:49.230
all born realised, absolutely they are.

40:49.470 --> 40:51.830
You can talk to them better than you can talk to,

40:52.070 --> 40:54.150
even a very well educated person.

40:54.390 --> 40:57.270
When I talk to them I just find I am just one with them.

40:57.470 --> 40:59.910
So this is the time, the resurrection time,

41:00.150 --> 41:03.310
this is the time that is the Last Judgement, and that’s why

41:03.550 --> 41:06.430
so many have taken birth for their judgement, all right?

41:06.630 --> 41:08.630
No I didn't ask this kind of seeking.

41:08.910 --> 41:11.470
I asked seeking the health, malaj.

41:11.710 --> 41:13.990
Physically sickening.

41:14.310 --> 41:18.190
She’s asking whether more people are sicker today

41:18.390 --> 41:21.270
than they were fifty years ago. But I fear if the question is obvious.

41:21.470 --> 41:24.190
so I think medical science and statistics have proven this,

41:24.390 --> 41:26.830
so I don’t think there’s any question there.

41:27.070 --> 41:28.070
No, no, but what’s she saying physically?

41:28.310 --> 41:30.790
You want to know why, she wants to know why

41:30.990 --> 41:33.070
Because you think they are physically sick, is it?

41:33.310 --> 41:37.350
Your judgement, no. You see they are physically sick

41:37.590 --> 41:41.910
because they have lost their roots.

41:42.230 --> 41:46.150
They have gone to extremes and imbalances.

41:46.510 --> 41:48.390
We cannot go to imbalance, you see.

41:48.630 --> 41:51.430
Religion is to keep yourself in balance.

41:51.630 --> 41:55.430
There are ten religions in the human being, like ten valencies.

41:55.630 --> 41:59.070
As carbon has four valencies, we have ten valencies.

41:59.310 --> 42:01.630
about which all the primordial masters

42:01.830 --> 42:04.110
who came on this earth have taught.

42:04.350 --> 42:07.110
Like Lao Tze, like Socrates,

42:07.310 --> 42:12.270
we can say Abraham, Moses and many in India also.

42:12.470 --> 42:15.190
They came and told us that we should keep the balance,

42:15.390 --> 42:20.430
balance our life, keep in the center for the ascent.

42:20.670 --> 42:23.350
If you are not balanced you cannot ascend.

42:23.590 --> 42:26.630
But people have gone to extremes. They are faddists.

42:26.870 --> 42:29.990
Whatever you tell them, if you tell them that see,

42:30.230 --> 42:32.550
"now you are not well, so you do something."

42:32.830 --> 42:37.030
They will do it so much that they’ll outwit everything, you see.

42:37.230 --> 42:40.550
They always go to the extreme of everything.

42:40.790 --> 42:44.790
So, that’s how the problems are there. But doesn’t matter.

42:45.070 --> 42:48.150
But moreover we are sick because we are seeking,

42:48.470 --> 42:50.630
because we are not satisfied.

42:50.910 --> 42:55.790
We feel unhappy, we can’t sleep, we don’t know why we are living.

42:58.270 --> 43:00.310
Is the other way round.

43:00.510 --> 43:02.350
We are not seeking because we are sick,

43:02.550 --> 43:06.310
but we are sick because we are seeking.

43:08.230 --> 43:12.910
Why is the Kundalini identified with female form?

43:13.230 --> 43:13.710
What?

43:13.910 --> 43:17.390
Why is Kundalini identified as a female form?

43:17.670 --> 43:20.630
Because it is the Power of God,

43:20.910 --> 43:23.950
and God is regarded as "He",

43:24.150 --> 43:27.310
and the Kundalini as the Mother.

43:27.550 --> 43:31.310
He as the Father, and the Holy Ghost as the Mother.

43:31.550 --> 43:32.830
She’s the Holy Ghost.

43:33.070 --> 43:36.110
So because He’s the Father, we have to have a lady with Him.

43:36.310 --> 43:38.070
So we call Her the Mother.

43:38.310 --> 43:40.430
And one should not feel bad about it,

43:40.630 --> 43:44.030
men should not feel bad at all because you all had a mother.

43:44.230 --> 43:46.430
You could not have come on this earth without a mother.

43:46.630 --> 43:49.470
You just can’t help it, that’s how the nature is.

43:49.750 --> 43:52.830
You have to accept the fact.

43:53.070 --> 43:56.790
Mother is a surety, isn’t it?

44:00.550 --> 44:02.030
Yes, please.

44:02.230 --> 44:03.790
Just first he and then you.

44:04.070 --> 44:06.110
Does Mother have a guru and

44:06.310 --> 44:09.910
what point did She gained Self-realization?

44:10.150 --> 44:12.270
Do you have a guru and at what stage

44:12.470 --> 44:14.430
did You receive Self-realization?

44:14.670 --> 44:17.430
I neither have a guru nor I want you to have a guru.

44:17.630 --> 44:19.950
You better become your own gurus.

44:20.150 --> 44:22.230
Secondly I’ve been born like that,

44:22.470 --> 44:24.630
I never got any realization or anything.

44:24.830 --> 44:27.630
I just got realization, I should say human realization

44:27.830 --> 44:30.870
when I understood what was the problem with human beings.

44:31.070 --> 44:34.230
I worked on the all permutations and combinations of human beings,

44:34.470 --> 44:37.190
because I wanted to have an en-masse media,

44:37.390 --> 44:39.990
by which I could give realization to thousands of people.

44:40.230 --> 44:44.390
Because any discovery which is made and is not brought to that level

44:44.630 --> 44:50.750
it is absolutely detrimental to the growth.

44:51.070 --> 44:54.950
For example, you see, Jesus was crucified. Why?

44:55.150 --> 45:00.630
Because He was alone! Only for His mother, nobody knew what He was.

45:00.910 --> 45:02.790
At that time He could not achieve this,

45:02.990 --> 45:05.990
because you all were not there at the time.

45:06.310 --> 45:11.630
And also other people - you know how the saints have suffered,

45:11.910 --> 45:14.470
how every prophet has suffered because

45:14.670 --> 45:18.350
because they could not create a mass understanding of it.

45:18.550 --> 45:21.990
So at a certain point it has to become a mass thing.

45:22.230 --> 45:25.830
In the tree of life there are only three or four

45:26.030 --> 45:28.790
flowers in the beginning, but when it grows,

45:29.030 --> 45:32.910
when the blossom time comes, then so many flowers are there

45:33.150 --> 45:35.630
and they become the fruits.

45:35.990 --> 45:40.550
So I, I just saw that this is the time I have to do this job.

45:40.790 --> 45:43.350
So you would call it My "human" realization

45:43.550 --> 45:45.910
when I understood human beings.

45:46.150 --> 45:48.950
Of course even now sometimes I get shocked the way they behave,

45:49.150 --> 45:55.950
I mean, I just don’t understand, but I think now I understand them.

45:56.950 --> 46:00.470
So those people who can’t quite understand that answer,

46:00.670 --> 46:01.870
don’t think about it too much.

46:02.070 --> 46:03.710
There's another gentlemen who was asking a question.

46:03.910 --> 46:06.790
Mother has to be somebody special, but find out for yourself.

46:06.990 --> 46:11.150
That’s the best way.
You don’t worry about Me, you worry about yourself.

46:11.390 --> 46:14.190
I must be someone, all right. Even if I’m not, doesn’t matter.

46:14.390 --> 46:16.470
If you are going to get it, why not have it?

46:16.790 --> 46:19.550
Who? The gentlemen there. Yes, please.

46:19.790 --> 46:23.190
Is that phase that You've given today, tomorrow, next day,

46:23.390 --> 46:25.910
I think on the [unclear] to call wholly

46:26.150 --> 46:29.070
or it just continues, or it stops like this.

46:29.310 --> 46:33.310
No, tonight She just gave an introductory lecture.

46:33.630 --> 46:35.110
Tomorrow night and the next night

46:35.310 --> 46:37.390
She will cover completely the subtle body.

46:37.630 --> 46:39.390
All right.

46:39.750 --> 46:42.070
The whole system.

46:42.350 --> 46:45.630
But You shouldn’t come late tomorrow.

46:47.630 --> 46:49.910
What if we can't get the three days?

46:50.150 --> 46:50.950
What is she saying?

46:51.150 --> 46:53.470
If you can’t get the three days and you seriously want

46:53.710 --> 46:56.150
to settle into it, the film is being taken. They'll be showing it.

46:56.390 --> 46:58.790
But why are you worried? Let us see for the present.

46:58.990 --> 47:03.230
Why should be in the future? You will get it. Why not?

47:03.470 --> 47:04.950
Why makes you, what makes you think,

47:05.150 --> 47:07.190
if you don’t get it, you are not going to miss it.

47:07.390 --> 47:08.790
We have people here,

47:08.990 --> 47:12.390
we have luckily an ashram, a beautiful place, you’ll like it,

47:12.630 --> 47:15.910
you can go there, they will give it to you.

47:17.990 --> 47:20.190
Listen, may I ask a question please?

47:20.390 --> 47:20.950
Yes.

47:21.150 --> 47:25.230
What is the first step to Self-realization?

47:25.510 --> 47:29.830
What is the first step to Self-realization?

47:30.150 --> 47:34.230
There is nothing like first, second. It's not a course, you see.

47:34.470 --> 47:38.910
The Kundalini, it's an awakening within us which takes place,

47:39.150 --> 47:41.710
which is like a living process. All right?

47:41.910 --> 47:45.150
So the Kundalini rises and shoots off here.

47:45.390 --> 47:51.310
Now, some people feel the Kundalini wobbling down there, down below.

47:51.750 --> 47:54.030
Some people feel it in the stomach.

47:54.230 --> 47:57.870
Some people feel it here; some people feel it here;

47:58.070 --> 48:01.830
but most of them feel it here only, jetting out like cool breeze.

48:02.070 --> 48:04.990
So you just can’t say what is the first step,

48:05.230 --> 48:08.870
depends on how it rises.

48:09.150 --> 48:11.390
So, everybody doesn’t feel the same way,

48:11.590 --> 48:16.230
So I can’t say that this is the first stage. All right?

48:17.710 --> 48:20.990
Of course first you feel thoughtlessly aware.

48:21.230 --> 48:24.510
You become thoughtlessly aware, first thing that should happen to you

48:24.710 --> 48:26.830
when the Kundalini crosses this center.

48:27.070 --> 48:30.230
When it comes out of it, you start feeling the cool breeze here,

48:30.430 --> 48:33.110
and you start feeling the cool breeze in your hands,

48:33.310 --> 48:35.470
and you start feeling the cool breeze around.

48:35.710 --> 48:38.550
That’s the second stage where it can go

48:38.830 --> 48:41.270
but some people really are so great

48:41.470 --> 48:44.550
that they become absolutely doubtlessly aware,

48:44.830 --> 48:46.750
what we call as Nirvikalpa. They achieve that.

48:46.990 --> 48:49.070
Some of them are really, they are just there.

48:49.270 --> 48:52.350
They are so beautifully made that they just become that.

48:52.550 --> 48:55.950
There’s no question left in their mind but they become so powerful.

48:56.150 --> 48:59.150
I’m amazed sometimes how they become so solid,

48:59.350 --> 49:01.630
really understanding themselves.

49:01.910 --> 49:05.310
So there are some people, I've known, who are very, very great

49:05.550 --> 49:08.550
and they just start emitting vibrations,

49:08.790 --> 49:12.150
they start giving realization, they start curing people.

49:12.390 --> 49:15.230
They can do it!

49:16.710 --> 49:18.790
So don’t condemn yourself in any way.

49:18.990 --> 49:21.870
That’s first condition in Sahaja Yoga.

49:22.070 --> 49:24.790
So should we now have realization?

49:24.990 --> 49:27.190
Those people are sitting very much behind

49:27.390 --> 49:31.630
should come in line with others, will be better idea.

49:32.670 --> 49:37.470
Yes, just move in, as much as possible, nearer.

49:38.390 --> 49:40.790
If you just slip your shoes off it helps you to...

49:40.990 --> 49:44.630
Yes, it is much better, because this Mother Earth helps you.

49:44.910 --> 49:48.310
Better to take out your shoes, will help.

49:51.390 --> 49:55.550
If some people want to sit on the ground, also it’s all right,

49:55.790 --> 49:58.190
but you should not be very far away

49:58.390 --> 50:03.910
because it’s better to attend to them. All right?

50:04.230 --> 50:05.830
If there are chairs here, yes.

50:06.070 --> 50:07.150
There are plenty there.

50:07.390 --> 50:08.150
Good.

50:08.390 --> 50:09.350
There are plenty of chairs here.

50:09.550 --> 50:12.790
The children can come here, come along, come and sit here.

50:13.030 --> 50:17.630
There’s a lot of room for the children. Children are the best.

50:17.910 --> 50:20.150
I’m very happy to see them here.

50:20.390 --> 50:23.630
All right, come along, sit down, sit down. Please come along.

50:23.910 --> 50:28.790
Look at their confidence! Sit down. Oh, great.

50:29.070 --> 50:30.430
Just slip your shoes off.

50:30.710 --> 50:34.390
Just slip out your shoes, all right? Great people.

50:34.630 --> 50:38.310
You too, you too. Yes, please take out his shoes.

50:38.550 --> 50:43.550
Just help him. You see, look at him, how he is alert.

50:45.670 --> 50:49.430
There are so many children as I told you, are realised souls.

50:49.670 --> 50:53.470
And we have to understand them. All right.

50:54.230 --> 50:58.870
So now, you have to just put your hands towards Me like this.

50:59.070 --> 51:01.790
Simple. Put your both the feet on the ground.

51:01.990 --> 51:05.870
Touch the Mother Earth with your feet, just. And be relaxed.

51:06.070 --> 51:09.830
You are not to do anything that will make you tense,

51:10.070 --> 51:14.790
means if you have anything tight here, or tight there just loosen it.

51:15.110 --> 51:18.350
Do not tighten your body also too much, don’t push back your head,

51:18.550 --> 51:23.790
or push forward, just be in a relaxed way, sit straight.

51:24.070 --> 51:26.350
Put your hands towards Me like this.

51:26.590 --> 51:29.870
And as I said the first condition is,

51:30.110 --> 51:35.350
to say that “Mother I am not guilty”, at least sixteen times.

51:35.550 --> 51:38.910
Is a punishment for people who feel that way.

51:40.710 --> 51:45.550
Before we start, let us tell ourselves that we are not guilty,

51:45.790 --> 51:49.990
because I am talking of God Almighty.

51:50.470 --> 51:53.390
He is the source of all joy,

51:53.670 --> 51:56.190
but He is the ocean of love,

51:56.390 --> 51:58.830
He’s the ocean of forgiveness,

51:59.070 --> 52:01.230
He’s the ocean of compassion.

52:01.470 --> 52:03.910
And what mistakes can we commit?

52:04.230 --> 52:09.790
So don’t start with your guilt at all. You are all God’s people,

52:10.070 --> 52:11.790
you must get your realization.

52:11.990 --> 52:14.110
So, just tell yourself,

52:14.310 --> 52:17.150
closing your eyes, in your heart,

52:17.390 --> 52:19.710
“Mother I am not guilty”. You say it sixteen times,

52:19.910 --> 52:22.550
is the best way, because there are sixteen petals here,

52:22.750 --> 52:26.790
and this is the center gets blocked if you feel guilty.

52:27.950 --> 52:32.550
Please close your eyes, and don’t open your eyes till I tell you.

52:32.790 --> 52:34.230
Now, just close your eyes, see.

52:34.430 --> 52:38.630
Do you feel the cool breeze in your hand? The children?

52:38.830 --> 52:41.270
Yes, that’s it. The children are already feeling it,

52:41.470 --> 52:45.310
all born-realised. Just imagine.

52:51.430 --> 52:56.230
Look at that. You should, you should have brought our children also,

52:56.470 --> 53:02.070
so sweet they are. Are you feeling?

53:02.310 --> 53:07.230
Good. You are all realised souls, that’s why you’ve come here.

53:07.790 --> 53:13.790
Now, the left hand, as I said, is the power of desire,

53:13.990 --> 53:16.790
so you put it towards Me, left side.

53:16.990 --> 53:19.430
That means you have to desire your realization.

53:19.670 --> 53:21.830
Keep it comfortably on your lap, it’s all right.

53:22.070 --> 53:25.470
Now, the right hand represents the power of action,

53:25.710 --> 53:29.630
so we have to use right hand to symbolically suggest

53:29.910 --> 53:34.030
our desire through this action.

53:34.270 --> 53:36.830
First of all put your right hand - don’t open your eyes,

53:37.070 --> 53:40.270
please don’t open your eyes at any cost, that’s important.

53:40.510 --> 53:41.990
Because if you open your eyes,

53:42.190 --> 53:45.990
the Kundalini won’t rise above Agnya Chakra.

53:46.230 --> 53:49.830
Now put your right hand on your heart.

53:51.390 --> 53:54.150
Don’t worry about anything, whether you are going to get it or not,

53:54.390 --> 53:56.870
but just put it - put little -

53:57.070 --> 54:02.430
sit little straight, you should not slouch down, yes.

54:02.750 --> 54:06.550
Put your - please put it on your heart.

54:06.790 --> 54:11.750
And now say in your heart that “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

54:11.950 --> 54:14.630
Ask a question.

54:19.910 --> 54:23.550
Because Spirit resides in the heart.

54:23.790 --> 54:28.110
Just ask a question, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

54:28.310 --> 54:31.470
Ask three times.

54:36.390 --> 54:38.230
It's cool.

54:39.910 --> 54:45.630
Now put down your right hand on your stomach, on the left-hand side.

54:45.910 --> 54:48.830
Now this is your guru principle, is your master principle,

54:49.070 --> 54:50.910
which has to be awakened.

54:51.150 --> 54:55.710
So you say, ten times,

54:55.910 --> 55:00.550
“Mother, I am my own guru, I am my own master.”

55:00.830 --> 55:06.630
Just assert it, it's there. You just have to say it before Me.

55:08.390 --> 55:12.110
“I am my own master.”

55:12.350 --> 55:14.190
If you have been to some gurus or anything,

55:14.390 --> 55:17.550
it will be all neutralised with it.

55:17.830 --> 55:19.710
So just say “Mother, I am my own master.”

55:19.910 --> 55:23.230
Because these gurus, actually kill that Spirit in you,

55:23.590 --> 55:27.230
kill that principle in you.

55:33.670 --> 55:37.310
Please say it ten times.

55:43.390 --> 55:48.550
Now again raise your right hand to your heart.

55:48.990 --> 55:50.990
And now with full confidence in yourself,

55:51.230 --> 55:54.150
because as you know, you are the temple of God,

55:54.390 --> 55:58.910
say that “Mother, I am the Spirit.”

55:59.230 --> 56:03.990
Say it twelve times, “Mother I am the Spirit.”

56:17.790 --> 56:21.230
It's on the Void. You put your hand.

56:27.990 --> 56:33.390
All right. You can use the light behind Me. You put that.

56:33.790 --> 56:41.750
Now, raise the same hand higher, onto the forehead.

56:43.270 --> 56:46.790
We have missed one center where you had to say

56:46.990 --> 56:50.790
“Mother I’m not guilty”. Because the Spirit cannot be guilty.

56:51.070 --> 56:54.550
It is sinless. But here at this point

56:54.790 --> 56:58.150
you have to say “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

56:58.430 --> 57:02.150
Now some of them said that “Mother it is difficult to forgive.”

57:02.390 --> 57:07.230
But it is a myth that you are not forgiving. It’s absolutely myth.

57:07.470 --> 57:10.310
You are doing nothing to that person who has harmed you,

57:10.550 --> 57:12.430
or to those persons who have harmed you.

57:12.670 --> 57:14.270
You are just harming yourself.

57:14.470 --> 57:16.150
So just put your hand across,

57:16.390 --> 57:20.950
hold it tight and say “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

57:21.150 --> 57:24.150
Hold it, just press it a little bit from both the sides.

57:24.390 --> 57:27.990
Hold it properly and just press it.

57:28.990 --> 57:32.710
Squeeze in, I think, towards the center,

57:32.950 --> 57:39.310
so that all extremes will disappear in the center.

57:42.470 --> 57:46.630
Now put this hand on top of your head,

57:47.270 --> 57:49.030
near the fontanelle bone area,

57:49.230 --> 57:54.070
where you had a very soft bone as a child.

57:54.430 --> 57:56.990
Try to press it with your palm.

57:57.230 --> 58:02.230
Try to press it with your palm. It’s quite heavy still.

58:02.550 --> 58:05.830
At this point I can’t cross your freedom.

58:06.070 --> 58:08.830
So you have to say, “Mother, I want realization,

58:09.070 --> 58:10.590
please give me realization."

58:10.790 --> 58:13.870
You have to ask for it, otherwise I cannot force it into you.

58:14.110 --> 58:17.550
Say it seven times please.

58:26.630 --> 58:29.990
It's there. Still some Void.

58:30.230 --> 58:33.390
Void and Agnya.

58:35.790 --> 58:39.390
Now you raise the same hand for a while, on top of your head,

58:39.630 --> 58:41.430
and see if there’s a cool breeze coming in.

58:41.630 --> 58:46.630
Just move it forward, backwards.

58:47.230 --> 58:51.550
See if there’s a cool breeze coming out. Good? All right.

58:51.790 --> 58:55.990
You can change over now. Don’t open your eyes, but change over.

58:56.230 --> 58:59.350
See from the other hand. Put the right hand towards Me,

58:59.590 --> 59:01.630
and put the left hand on top of your head,

59:01.830 --> 59:05.910
and see if there’s a cool breeze coming in.

59:21.230 --> 59:27.470
First you will feel it on top of your head and then in your hands.

59:53.990 --> 59:56.910
You can always change your hand and see.

59:57.230 --> 59:58.990
Once this hand, once that hand.

59:59.230 --> 01:00:02.470
But don’t open your eyes. But put the other hand towards Me.

01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:12.310
It’s very cool.

01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:50.790
Now, if you have felt on your head

01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:52.990
just try to put your hands towards Me,

01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:57.390
and see that, if you are feeling it in your hands.

01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:04.630
Further, you are seeing at the back, now see it in front.

01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:09.670
Now in the hands you might feel it, just try in your hands.

01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:21.430
You may raise your hands high, up like this. You can open your eyes

01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:25.430
and raise your hands like this. And ask a question,

01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:28.390
that, “Is this the power of God?

01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:33.550
Is this the power of Holy Ghost?

01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:38.790
Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?” Just ask the question.

01:01:53.070 --> 01:01:56.550
Are you feeling it? Something happening in the fingers,

01:01:56.790 --> 01:02:02.470
You’ll feel very relaxed, first of all. Extremely relaxed.

01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:08.230
All right? Now just see if it is happening.

01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:17.910
In your hands. Just see in your hands. Put them back.

01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:23.310
All right? Is there now? Not yet?

01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:26.070
How many of you are feeling the cool breeze in the head?

01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:30.230
Please raise your hands. It's good?

01:02:30.590 --> 01:02:33.630
And in the hands?

01:02:34.070 --> 01:02:38.790
Only in the hands. All right, it will work out.

01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:41.230
Now keep your eyes open.

01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:46.550
I’ll tell you another way, how you can raise your own Kundalini.

01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:49.470
You just watch Me and you do the same.

01:02:49.790 --> 01:02:50.910
You put your left hand,

01:02:51.110 --> 01:02:53.990
near towards your Kundalini like this, while sitting down.

01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:57.790
Let’s see. Now, sit little erect, all right?

01:02:57.990 --> 01:03:02.070
Now. And then, this right hand is to be used like this,

01:03:02.310 --> 01:03:04.590
you put the right hand across,

01:03:04.790 --> 01:03:09.310
front, below, back, up. Like that.

01:03:09.550 --> 01:03:14.630
You move the right hand like this.

01:03:15.110 --> 01:03:20.150
Just start moving it. Now bring it higher, over your head,

01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:26.230
put it high, and just turn it, give it a twist and tie it up.

01:03:27.310 --> 01:03:33.230
Try again please. Put this hand in front like this,

01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:37.150
with the right hand you start moving in this manner,

01:03:37.390 --> 01:03:38.870
which is a clockwise manner.

01:03:39.070 --> 01:03:41.790
Just start moving, move it properly, that’s very important.

01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:43.790
Keep one hand steadily moving.

01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:47.990
Now give it a twist again and one other knot.

01:03:48.310 --> 01:03:52.270
There are three powers, so for the third power we give three knots,

01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:57.070
not putting down our hands. Now let’s do again.

01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:05.870
Now put it up. Tie it up once, you don’t put down the hands.

01:04:06.070 --> 01:04:09.990
Again, give it a twist,

01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:14.990
knot, another one, nicely.

01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:19.470
Now see if you are feeling the cool breeze.

01:04:30.070 --> 01:04:33.910
Feeling?

01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:37.470
You can open your eyes.

01:04:42.070 --> 01:04:44.830
Now more people must be feeling cool breeze in their heads.

01:04:45.070 --> 01:04:47.830
It's so high as that, some people are feeling, yes, too.

01:04:48.070 --> 01:04:52.990
You can feel it higher, lower, anywhere. Just see.

01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:58.430
If you don’t feel it you have to say,

01:04:58.670 --> 01:05:00.950
“Please give me realisation Mother”, that’s all.

01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:06.030
You have to ask for it, that’s all, with your full heart.

01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:11.390
It’s there. All right? Good. Just ask for it.

01:05:11.630 --> 01:05:17.150
Just for the asking, because that’s your own right.

01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:22.150
All right? All the children have got it; beautifully.

01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:24.630
So may God bless you all.

01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:27.350
I’ll be here tomorrow again,

01:05:27.550 --> 01:05:31.790
and I’ll tell you about the imbalances we have, how we create them,

01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:34.390
how to get over them.

01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:38.830
In two lectures I hope I’ll be able to cover lot of things.

01:05:39.110 --> 01:05:42.470
But as you know, knowledge is like an ocean,

01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:45.790
and I don’t know how many lectures so far I have given,

01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:50.550
thousands, and so many are on the tape,

01:05:50.790 --> 01:05:52.310
and you can listen to them,

01:05:52.550 --> 01:05:55.990
about various dimensions of our Spirituality.

01:05:56.310 --> 01:05:59.830
What is the Spirit, how it manifests,

01:06:00.070 --> 01:06:03.470
what is the creation, everything is there.

01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:07.390
You can come to our ashram, which is a very beautiful place,

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:11.150
and can listen to it, you can borrow from them

01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:13.710
and enjoy it for yourself.

01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:16.630
Tomorrow I hope to see you again, and day after,

01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:21.310
so I establish this realization with you.

01:06:21.630 --> 01:06:25.870
I would request you to bring some salt, sugar and water tomorrow,

01:06:26.070 --> 01:06:31.790
which I can vibrate for you, which will be a good thing to take.

01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:36.470
Just bring little bit not much is needed, just to vibrate.

01:06:36.790 --> 01:06:39.990
Thank you very much.

01:06:46.990 --> 01:06:51.790
I think tonight we’ll let Mother go home. She’s had a long day.

01:06:52.070 --> 01:06:55.030
And take the chance of meeting Her tomorrow night…

01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:57.350
I’ll meet everyone, individually, tomorrow,

01:06:57.550 --> 01:06:59.990
because today they fixed Me up with everything,

01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:05.110
television, radio, this, that. I was rushing everywhere, you see,

01:07:05.310 --> 01:07:09.550
and, I came in the morning by plane and you know what it is like.

01:07:09.790 --> 01:07:12.550
So if you could excuse Me today,

01:07:12.790 --> 01:07:15.230
tomorrow I'll be definitely here for a longer period,

01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:17.550
and I’ll meet all of you individually.

01:07:17.790 --> 01:07:19.390
And also if you have any questions,

01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:24.230
it’s better that you write them down in a paper and bring it here.

01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:25.550
Another thing I would suggest,

01:07:25.790 --> 01:07:27.310
that you must take the books, if you got the books.

01:07:27.550 --> 01:07:28.070
Yes.

01:07:28.310 --> 01:07:29.990
Books, but don’t read them tonight

01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:33.310
because again your head will be off.

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:37.070
But you can take the photograph, and

01:07:37.310 --> 01:07:40.270
you can put your hands towards the photograph

01:07:40.510 --> 01:07:43.070
with a light before it. Because photograph has got vibrations.

01:07:43.310 --> 01:07:45.310
It has the same coefficient, it gives vibrations.

01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:47.190
Luckily, you see, very good.

01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:49.870
So if you put your left hand toward the photograph,

01:07:50.070 --> 01:07:51.990
first, with a light,

01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:54.630
you will start gradually feeling the cool breeze,

01:07:54.910 --> 01:07:56.230
right hand outside like that,

01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:58.710
you see like an outlet given.

01:07:58.990 --> 01:08:01.790
The whole thing that’s wrong there, passes out of this hand.

01:08:02.030 --> 01:08:04.110
Then you put your right hand towards the photograph,

01:08:04.310 --> 01:08:05.870
and the left hand outside.

01:08:06.070 --> 01:08:08.830
At this time, before sleeping if you do it,

01:08:09.070 --> 01:08:13.110
you can have a little basin of water,

01:08:13.310 --> 01:08:15.190
in which you can put some salt,

01:08:15.390 --> 01:08:19.630
and put your feet in it so the water sucks in problems within you.

01:08:19.830 --> 01:08:22.070
It’s very interesting to use all the five elements.

01:08:22.310 --> 01:08:23.950
We are using light,

01:08:24.150 --> 01:08:27.790
we can use the water, every sort of thing is to be used,

01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:29.910
just to give us proper balance.

01:08:30.150 --> 01:08:34.790
So, I hope you take the photograph and do the needful tonight.

01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:37.030
And don’t discuss about it, talk about it,

01:08:37.230 --> 01:08:40.110
because you cannot understand it with this limited brain.

01:08:40.310 --> 01:08:43.030
It’s an unlimited space where you have gone.

01:08:43.270 --> 01:08:46.790
Thank you very much. May God bless you.

01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:55.190
As you leave tonight, for those people who would like to follow it up

01:08:55.390 --> 01:08:58.910
we are very happy to let you know, where we meet each week,

01:08:59.110 --> 01:09:01.990
so that you could learn about Kundalini,

01:09:02.230 --> 01:09:05.670
about the chakras and develop your realization.

01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:08.910
So give to the person standing at the back

01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:10.350
your address and your telephone number.

01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:12.470
Why don’t you tell them address now? No harm.

01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:13.510
No, certainly.

01:09:13.710 --> 01:09:17.630
And the telephone number it's better if you write it down.

01:09:18.310 --> 01:09:20.630
Also give your name, but also...

01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:27.190
We have the ashram, the center is at 1267 Burke Road Kew.

01:09:27.390 --> 01:09:27.950
Again.

01:09:28.150 --> 01:09:31.870
1267 Burke Road Kew.

01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:34.310
Is it very easy to get to the road,

01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:37.430
there's two tram stop practically on the doorstep.

01:09:37.630 --> 01:09:39.630
However, that address is written

01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:41.630
or it's stamped on the bottom of a sheet

01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:44.070
that is enclosed in the little booklet that we have

01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:47.190
at the back of the hall. Our phone number also is there.

01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:51.950
It's 801696. You’re very welcome to come and see us.

01:09:52.150 --> 01:09:56.630
On Sunday as at the moment we’re planning to have a workshop,

01:09:56.910 --> 01:10:00.150
where you are all welcome to come and spend time with Mother,

01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:03.430
and She will be able to talk to you more closely and

01:10:03.670 --> 01:10:07.230
show you in more practical ways how Sahaja Yoga,

01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:11.390
how this Kundalini awakening can work within you.

01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:15.990
When Mother said "bring salt sugar and water", it's to bring

01:10:16.230 --> 01:10:20.030
a small quantity of those particular substances because they can act

01:10:20.230 --> 01:10:24.910
upon our subtle body because they embody some of the essences

01:10:25.150 --> 01:10:27.830
that we have within ourselves. Just a small quantity

01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:30.470
in an opened packet, you know, so that it's easy, easy to reach, ok?

01:10:30.710 --> 01:10:33.550
Plastic bag or something.

01:10:33.790 --> 01:10:34.990
Take the addresses then.

01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:39.990
Oh, yes. And just for your own sake as much as anything,

01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:45.030
what often happens is, you know, it's quite hard to even comprehend

01:10:45.230 --> 01:10:47.510
what's gone on this evening, ok.

01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:52.790
You’ve come along, you've been given realization and you know

01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:56.430
it’s way beyond our own comprehension as to what's really happened

01:10:56.670 --> 01:11:00.070
and it's so easy to go away and think, "Oh, no, no.

01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:03.070
They were telling me stories. It couldn’t possibly be true."

01:11:03.310 --> 01:11:06.990
It is true, believe it. We can help you find that out,

01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:11.150
and establish it within yourself and just to help you,

01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:13.150
if you can give us your names and addresses.

01:11:13.390 --> 01:11:16.070
I’m certainly not forcing you to do it or anything like that

01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:18.830
but if you can do that, then we can keep in touch with you

01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:21.470
and help you establish it further.

01:11:21.710 --> 01:11:26.390
One instant God. I mean afterall, you must know that sometimes,

01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:29.550
it may take little time. Of course, it works instantly,

01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:32.190
but if something wrong inside then it takes time.

01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:34.990
So give more time to yourself, little patience with yourself,

01:11:35.230 --> 01:11:37.230
as I have patience with you.

01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:39.390
You must have some patience with yourself

01:11:39.630 --> 01:11:42.950
and just try to understand that this has to work out.

01:11:43.150 --> 01:11:44.630
That’s very important.

01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:48.430
If it has not worked out, it will have to be worked out.

01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:51.150
May God bless you.
