00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:12.560
So I think is very important
for you to worship the Adi Shakti

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:19.880
and the Adi Kundalini. Is
absolutely without understanding,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:29.760
absolutely you cannot understand
how you have become a saint.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.250
When you will know within yourself
you have got all these centers,

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.180
and these centers have to be awakened

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.880
through the awakening of the Kundalini,

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:51.860
and that the Kundalini expresses
Herself through your fingertips.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:01.650
Unless and until you fully identify with this knowledge

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.580
there's always a possibility that you will deviate

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.710
from the path of your perfection.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.250
Many people who come to Sahaja Yoga, I have seen,

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.960
they meet some Sahaja Yogis who are half way

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.080
and because they are mental, they start arguing,

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.900
"How is it this is this way, how is it, it is this way?

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.860
How is it he's a Sahaja Yogi, he behaves like that?"

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.950
There are so many ways of people relating

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.810
to the power of the Divine.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.300
I have told you in the beginning that God felt lonely

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.970
and that's why He created this Adi Shakti

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.350
and through Her the whole universe was created.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:05.290
But also true that as you are seeking,

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.740
also the Divine is seeking you.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:17.290
Also that your seeking is absolutely awarded

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:25.050
if you understand the simple thing about Divine:

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.010
that it is the One that has given you intelligence.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.180
It is the One that has given you wisdom.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.350
It is the One which has given you

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.530
whatever you have- as you were singing that,

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.080
"Whatever we have is given by You".

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.790
If that is the case that all that you have

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.440
is given by your Kundalini,

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.340
by this mother power of your Kundalini,

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.300
then is very important to understand what is the need

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:12.170
of keeping Her happy and Her satisfaction.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:21.140
You must try to see what makes Her happy.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.750
As I said, there's a relationship

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:32.480
between the realized souls and the Divine.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.540
The Divine is happy when you are happy.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.410
Or we can say, when the Divine makes you happy

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.050
and you are happy, then the Divine is happy.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.100
It's such a relationship.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.430
And it's so close, it's so close,

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.890
we can say as the sun has sun's rays,

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.990
or the moon has its own moonlight.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:16.420
It is so close, it's so ingrained, so much built in

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.840
and that should give you full control over yourself

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.380
and over your development.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:35.430
They describe it in various
ways that you must surrender.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.050
Now

00:04:45.645 --> 00:04:50.780
one surrenders, of course, with fear.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.399
If somebody comes with a sword and
says, "All right, you surrender," you may.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.869
But as soon as that person will disappear,
you'll take out another sword and cut his throat.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.339
That surrender has no meaning.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:10.650
That surrender is a surrender
which is just forced onto you.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.780
All such surrenders have been creating problems,

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.570
because it has a reaction.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:26.790
But your surrender to Divine is extremely joy giving.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:42.890
Like a salt which dissolves into the sea automatically,

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.790
into the water automatically,

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:56.730
that soluble nature is really joy giving.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.770
If you can just feel that within yourself,

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.160
that you are one with the Divine.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.450
You are dissolved in the ocean of the Divine.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:20.820
And then what takes your
form is nothing but extreme love,

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:27.420
compassion and, as a result, extreme joy.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:34.600
Many people tell Me that, "Mother,
it's very difficult to forgive someone."

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:40.580
But I think it's very horrible not to forgive someone.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.620
There's a great joy in forgiving,

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.340
very great joy in forgiving.
And as soon as you forgive,

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:55.840
the Divine takes over and Divine will look after you.

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.950
Nobody can disturb you.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.600
But first you must surrender to the Divine,

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.040
that is what is forgiveness.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.760
Just don't bother yourself as to punish somebody

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.700
or to do something against somebody.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.890
The Divine takes over from you

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.990
and does whatever is needed,

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:28.860
and in such a beautiful manner
that it is worth seeing how it works.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:34.420
Adi Shakti's power, this Divine,
is described in every religion.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.860
say in Islam called ruh;

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:41.840
in the Bible is called as All Pervading Power;

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.220
is called as allak - that which cannot be seen;

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:52.180
Niranjana, the One which is
beyond any attachment sort of thing.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.980
All these words are used for this Divine Power.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.740
People have heard about it, people have sung about it;

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:06.500
but unfortunately very few people felt it,

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:11.660
and when they felt it they didn't
know how to give it to others,

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.200
how to make others feel it.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.890
So whatever they talked became sort of a story

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:20.140
or something nonsensical.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:24.120
Nobody could believe that
they have felt anything like that

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:30.240
or could imagine that there is
such a Power really existing.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:36.280
Now, luckily, it has become
quite a universal fact for all of you,

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.560
that you know there is this Power.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.110
You're sure about this Power

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:47.490
because you can feel it within yourself.

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.630
And when you feel it, you feel very joyous.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:57.010
You can make out whether
somebody is telling you the truth or not,

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:02.820
because you can see on the vibrations on this,

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:12.350
I should say, the Power of Adi Shakti.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.790
She tells you the truth.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.830
If somebody has done some harm to you, for example,

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:27.670
now you may say that,
"Mother, if you forgive that person

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:31.630
then it's not the truth because
he has definitely harmed,

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:37.060
and if I forgive that means I
accept that he has not harmed me."

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.610
This kind of argument is possible.

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.530
Now you will see, you'll be surprised

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:45.400
that you forgive that person,

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.190
because the truth is whether
you forgive or you don't forgive,

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.210
you don't do anything.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:54.890
That's the truth.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:59.640
So out of compassion if you forgive someone,

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.300
compassion becomes the truth.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:07.180
Is the compassion that tells you the truth.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.520
So all the absolute truth that you know is

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:15.360
through the compassion of the Divine Power.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:20.270
Maybe sometimes people say,
"We saw the vibrations, Mother,

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:23.640
and we felt this way and still it happened."

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:26.780
It makes no difference.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.840
Whatever has happened has happened, doesn't matter.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:34.080
You have felt the vibrations,
and you asked the vibrations

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:38.510
and you acted upon the vibrations, that's all.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:43.330
Whether it turned out to be
that way or not is different.

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.930
Because it had to be the other way round.

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:50.540
Some drama is going on. Is the chitvilas,

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:55.570
is the enjoyment of the chitta of the Divine.

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:58.470
So, it's a play going on.

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:04.930
If you can see that play then
you don't get disturbed - it's a play.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:13.880
How it works, how it is
organized, is not your headache.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:19.390
You just have to see the play
of the Divine, how it works out.

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:24.060
We have seen now, all of you, which
you call as miracles have happened.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:28.170
"Mother, this miracle has
happened, that miracle has happened

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:35.900
and I know is all the miracle of the Divine."

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:44.740
Despite that, our faith in the Divine
is not so much enlightened faith.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.870
When you have the enlightened faith,

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:54.600
you don't worry about things
which are very important in life.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:12:00.640
It works out, well and good, if it
doesn't work out, well and good.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:05.960
It should not be assumed that
once you are a realized soul

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:11.840
that the whole world can fall at your feet.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:15.620
Not necessarily. It's a play.

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:23.710
It's a beautiful enjoyment of
the attention of the Adi Shakti.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:27.250
So if you can become the witness,

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:31.020
if you can really become
the witness of the whole thing,

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:38.630
then what happens you grow spiritually much closer.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:44.820
I should say you get dissolved in the Divine Power.

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:47.880
That dissolution has to take place.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:51.800
That's why today's puja is very important for you,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.540
because if it was not Adi Shakti
Who had taken an incarnation,

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.840
this work could not have been done.

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:07.100
This could not have been.
Because it had to be something

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:19.200
that would encompass all the
angularities of this human life,

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:23.270
all the aspects of this human life.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:27.040
It had to be such an Incarnation

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:35.230
that could absolutely see human being as a whole,

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:39.750
not only his physical self, mental self, emotional self

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:47.580
or his particular ideologies, or
his particular domination - no,

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.810
as a whole, as a human being.

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:55.340
And human being, as I told you, is all inside,

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.860
all of them are just the same.

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:08.230
Some are more sensitive and seeking, genuinely,

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:12.310
some are not seeking genuinely,

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:15.960
and some are not seeking at all.

00:14:16.041 --> 00:14:19.820
But the seeking also is given to you by Adi Shakti.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:25.870
So, you have to worship. And is the
best way to please your own Kundalini,

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:29.440
your own Mother who has given you this birth.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.716
May God bless you.
