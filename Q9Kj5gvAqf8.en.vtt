00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.679
One has to realize that

00:00:11.038 --> 00:00:15.198
modern times are the times of confusion.

00:00:15.896 --> 00:00:18.166
You don't know what you want.

00:00:18.932 --> 00:00:22.426
You don't know what you want to ask.

00:00:23.096 --> 00:00:29.143
You don't know whatever you are doing is right or wrong.

00:00:29.223 --> 00:00:34.564
Confusion is necessary.

00:00:34.644 --> 00:00:38.165
Without confusion, we are not desperate.

00:00:38.245 --> 00:00:43.257
Without desperation we do not seek.

00:00:44.152 --> 00:00:51.444
But confusion is only visible

00:00:51.524 --> 00:00:57.671
when a person reaches a certain area of awareness

00:00:57.751 --> 00:01:02.168
or we can say a degree of awareness.

00:01:02.248 --> 00:01:07.463
Say, at a stage when Moses came on this earth

00:01:07.543 --> 00:01:10.764
when the desperation was different,

00:01:10.844 --> 00:01:16.924
that they wanted to get out of slavery.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.430
It was a different style of understanding they had.

00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:30.841
How to organize a society on a particular pattern

00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:40.081
so you achieve the maximum
amount of efficiency out of that society.

00:01:40.818 --> 00:01:43.586
And it was an emergency.

00:01:44.393 --> 00:01:55.633
It was a very touch and go
position for the Jews at that time.

00:01:56.718 --> 00:02:01.935
It has happened in many countries, in many generations,

00:02:02.015 --> 00:02:08.529
that they reached a state where
they felt extremely desperate.

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:15.903
The slavery of man was very apparent at that time.

00:02:15.983 --> 00:02:19.230
But before that, people didn't feel bad about the slavery.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.998
They had accepted it. They had taken it for granted.

00:02:23.078 --> 00:02:26.788
And then a time came when they felt, "This is slavery,

00:02:26.868 --> 00:02:30.223
and we are not going to have any more of it."

00:02:32.414 --> 00:02:37.598
And a leader came. That leader worked it out for them.

00:02:37.678 --> 00:02:42.799
Today in these modern times we
have a very subtle type of slavery

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.779
which is every day eating us,

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.285
which is so self-destroying

00:02:48.365 --> 00:02:52.605
that we are not even aware of it, and we get destroyed.

00:02:53.906 --> 00:02:59.266
This destruction is working in so many ways

00:03:01.534 --> 00:03:08.673
that, if we do not really awaken ourselves to the truth,

00:03:09.677 --> 00:03:16.646
there is a possibility that nothing
will be left out of this creation.

00:03:16.726 --> 00:03:20.074
There are people who give big lectures.

00:03:20.154 --> 00:03:24.122
I have met many big people from United Nations

00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:27.110
and from all these big, big agencies.

00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:31.615
They talk about the coming destruction, the future shock,

00:03:31.696 --> 00:03:34.761
and this going to happen. 
They book big books. They discuss.

00:03:34.842 --> 00:03:36.774
They sit on the street, they'll discuss.

00:03:36.855 --> 00:03:38.850
They are in a pub, they are discussing.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.511
They are in a party, they are discussing.

00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:44.916
But they do not realize what it means.

00:03:44.996 --> 00:03:50.422
This destruction is a kind of a destruction

00:03:50.502 --> 00:03:54.104
that has never taken before.

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:59.069
Because this destruction is going to come from within

00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:01.544
and not from without.

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:07.843
We have reached a certain depth in our awareness.

00:04:07.923 --> 00:04:14.176
And if we do not touch the source of our sustenance,

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.670
this destruction is going to work out.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.507
Now for many people it is, "Oh forget it, forget it.

00:04:21.587 --> 00:04:22.866
We'll see about it."

00:04:22.947 --> 00:04:26.021
Some people are of this opinion, 
"All right. Forget it. What?

00:04:26.102 --> 00:04:28.224
Destruction? All right. Doesn't matter

00:04:28.558 --> 00:04:30.957
We'll see tomorrow."

00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:34.903
And some of them I've seen are sitting down waiting,

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:39.028
"Oh God, thank God there's
destruction, so this all is finished. Ha!

00:04:39.108 --> 00:04:41.008
We don't have to bother our heads.

00:04:41.088 --> 00:04:43.645
Thank God, there is destruction promised."

00:04:46.546 --> 00:04:52.006
Whatever attitude one may take, one has to realize

00:04:52.086 --> 00:04:55.406
that these are very serious things.

00:04:56.029 --> 00:05:01.060
The creation has reached its maximum growth now.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:06.791
The growth is expressed as human beings.

00:05:06.871 --> 00:05:11.431
These human beings are the actors on the stage.

00:05:12.058 --> 00:05:18.299
Whole nature is working out this new happening.

00:05:19.688 --> 00:05:23.393
Now only one thing has to happen to you is

00:05:23.473 --> 00:05:28.765
that you have to get connected with the Divine.

00:05:29.314 --> 00:05:32.874
You have to get connected with the whole.

00:05:33.603 --> 00:05:41.645
You have to know your own meaning,
and you have to know your purpose.

00:05:41.725 --> 00:05:50.525
If this can happen to you, then you are in the other world.

00:05:51.228 --> 00:05:53.443
You are made for this.

00:05:53.523 --> 00:05:55.642
You are made a human being with a purpose.

00:05:55.722 --> 00:05:56.720
We must think.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.822
All the scientists must ask
once at least this question, "Why?

00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:05.509
Why are we made human beings?

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:10.509
From animal stage, why have we
come to this stage? What is the reason?"

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.382
This question is working in the
unconscious of every seeker today.

00:06:17.462 --> 00:06:21.758
That's how we have so many seekers all over the world.

00:06:21.838 --> 00:06:27.212
And these seekers are just
trying to find out why are we here.

00:06:27.292 --> 00:06:35.815
Some of them find an answer
sometimes in some material well-being.

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:39.916
Say our strikes nowadays - railways.

00:06:39.996 --> 00:06:46.356
Well it's very narrow view of the
whole thing - very narrow view.

00:06:46.436 --> 00:06:49.500
"You want to have more pay? All right, have it."

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.729
Then what?

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:53.794
Those who talk of communism...

00:06:53.874 --> 00:06:56.393
I've been to Moscow, I am again going back.

00:06:56.473 --> 00:07:01.172
I mean if you ask them they
say, "Oh we haven't got joy as yet."

00:07:01.252 --> 00:07:04.063
I am not against communism or against democracy.

00:07:04.143 --> 00:07:07.391
Both things are just jokes to Me.

00:07:07.471 --> 00:07:11.471
You are neither communistic nor democratic.

00:07:11.978 --> 00:07:17.364
Only after realization you can become both simultaneously.

00:07:17.444 --> 00:07:20.510
Because you have no powers to be capitalistic or democratic,

00:07:20.591 --> 00:07:21.930
you have no power to vote.

00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:26.671
You don't know anything about yourself.
What are you voting for? You can't see.

00:07:26.752 --> 00:07:34.229
Unless and until there is light,
unless and until we can see,

00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:37.102
how are we going to vote for?

00:07:37.182 --> 00:07:40.561
For example we vote a person - for what?

00:07:40.641 --> 00:07:44.027
"Oh! He's a very nice man," all right.

00:07:44.107 --> 00:07:46.762
What is nice about him?

00:07:46.842 --> 00:07:49.282
How do you know he's a nice man?

00:07:49.876 --> 00:07:52.874
How do you know he will not be a bad man?

00:07:52.954 --> 00:07:58.083
Can you say that today the one who
looks like a nice, a very nice person,

00:07:58.163 --> 00:08:04.481
will not emit scorpions or snakes all around him?

00:08:04.561 --> 00:08:08.600
A person who apparently looks a beautiful personality

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.567
may turn out to be a horrid person.

00:08:11.647 --> 00:08:14.810
There is no absolute way of judging anyone.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:18.021
So how are we to vote any?

00:08:19.828 --> 00:08:24.933
If you think that you know how to judge,

00:08:25.013 --> 00:08:29.663
then, I think, you have to still learned.

00:08:29.743 --> 00:08:33.166
Because still you make lots of
mistakes, you will not admit that

00:08:33.246 --> 00:08:35.395
"I don't know." That's the point.

00:08:35.475 --> 00:08:38.227
Once you reach that state of saying, "I don't know.

00:08:38.307 --> 00:08:41.535
I say this is a nice man, but I can't say.

00:08:41.615 --> 00:08:43.488
I'm not sure about this person."

00:08:43.568 --> 00:08:48.000
That's the point where you reach,
when you are unsure about it.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:54.760
that you want to know surely if
something is really truthful and honest.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.019
Our sense of honesty and everything is so superficial -

00:09:00.099 --> 00:09:01.834
is so superficial.

00:09:01.914 --> 00:09:04.834
For us, honesty means if you give me five pounds,

00:09:04.914 --> 00:09:09.917
I'll return five pounds to you.
Is done. Finished. It's honest.

00:09:09.997 --> 00:09:12.878
Everything is so superficial.

00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:17.338
That's why we can never be satisfied.

00:09:17.418 --> 00:09:22.590
Even if you get ten percent more
pay or twenty percent more pay,

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:26.506
you are not going to be happy. Take it from Me.

00:09:26.586 --> 00:09:30.891
Material things do not give us happiness. Never.

00:09:30.971 --> 00:09:34.694
But I do not say that we do not need material things.

00:09:34.774 --> 00:09:37.892
We need material things.

00:09:38.714 --> 00:09:47.269
But matter is something like a
cup which has the nectar in it.

00:09:47.349 --> 00:09:53.368
If you are thirsty, you cannot
take it from an empty cup, anything.

00:09:53.448 --> 00:09:57.752
It may be a cup of gold, what
does it matter, difference to you?

00:09:57.832 --> 00:10:01.789
You must have something to quench your thirst.

00:10:01.869 --> 00:10:06.329
And that thirst, unless and until it is quenched,

00:10:07.722 --> 00:10:09.788
you are not going to be happy.

00:10:09.868 --> 00:10:11.839
And what is that thirst?

00:10:11.919 --> 00:10:16.608
Is this that still you have not known yourself.

00:10:16.688 --> 00:10:22.167
It's a very unconscious thirst.

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:24.847
It comes - you don't know what you are seeking.

00:10:24.927 --> 00:10:26.966
You don't know why you are unhappy,

00:10:27.046 --> 00:10:29.859
you don't know what you want.

00:10:29.939 --> 00:10:33.455
That is the unconscious which is working it out.

00:10:33.535 --> 00:10:38.507
But the time has come that you should know what you are,

00:10:38.587 --> 00:10:41.727
and what is your glory, what is your greatness,

00:10:41.807 --> 00:10:43.761
what are your powers.

00:10:43.841 --> 00:10:47.008
They're all built within yourself.

00:10:47.088 --> 00:10:52.798
All these days when you grew
up in your evolutionary process,

00:10:52.878 --> 00:10:57.427
all these things were built within you as shown here.

00:10:57.507 --> 00:10:59.948
They are all there.

00:11:00.028 --> 00:11:04.108
Actually I am just a catalyst you can say.

00:11:04.705 --> 00:11:08.474
Just a candle which is enlightened.

00:11:08.554 --> 00:11:12.155
And this candle, when touches another candle which is ready,

00:11:12.235 --> 00:11:14.010
that gets enlightened.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:17.299
I mean you may give it a big scientific name,

00:11:17.379 --> 00:11:20.683
and charged personality, this, that. 
I don't understand.

00:11:20.763 --> 00:11:22.538
It's very simple for Me.

00:11:22.618 --> 00:11:24.673
We are all ready for it.

00:11:24.753 --> 00:11:28.581
I just touch you and you get
enlightened, and you get the light,

00:11:28.661 --> 00:11:32.050
and when you touch someone,
that person also gets enlightened.
