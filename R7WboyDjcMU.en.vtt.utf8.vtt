00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:37.500
- I bow to all the seekers of Truth.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.100
As I told you yesterday that Truth is not a concept

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.380
- [INTERPRETER]

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.360
When people start establishing something as Truth

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.340
- [INTERPRETER]

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.000
- there arises the problem
- [INTERPRETER]

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.640
because Truth cannot be organized,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.860
cannot be ordered, cannot be changed - it is what it is.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.720
- [INTERPRETER]

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.500
And today the Truth is, that the time has come

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.540
for people to get their resurrection,

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.880
- [INTERPRETER]

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.060
that the time has come where people have to ascend to their higher being.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:00.040
- [INTERPRETER]

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.220
As in Koran described very clearly, is Kiama - is the time of resurrection.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.180
- [INTERPRETER]

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.000
Said very clearly, that your hands will speak

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.740
- [INTERPRETER]

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.220
- and they will give witness about.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.640
- This is time of Last Judgment.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.400
God is not going to weigh people to judge them.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.380
- [INTERPRETER]

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.800
It is you only, in your ascent, are going to judge yourself.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.700
- [INTERPRETER]

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:06.460
And there are people who are a special category today, who are seeking something higher.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.920
- [INTERPRETER]

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:22.400
- Now, yesterday a question was raised about the religion part.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.680
All these religions which have come on this earth,

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.540
are product of Divine force.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.000
- [INTERPRETER]

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.600
All the prophets and Incarnations, all of them came on this earth

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.520
to propound a special milestone within us.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:57.340
- [INTERPRETER]

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.700
On the tree of life, all of them grew one after another

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.100
- [INTERPRETER]
- but people

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:22.600
took out or removed them from the tree of life saying, "This is my religion, this is my religion."

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:30.060
- [INTERPRETER]

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:36.360
- So believing into something that is dead.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:43.560
So, what we see today, is a mess

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:51.640
- [INTERPRETER]
- and people can't understand
- [INTERPRETER]

00:05:52.080 --> 00:06:00.280
- how those who profess a particular religion
- [INTERPRETER]
- act just the opposite of it.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:08.220
- [INTERPRETER]
- I've seen people who live, say, in Riyadh -

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:16.100
- [INTERPRETER]
- they don't drink, they don't look at women because  they're frightened - their eyes

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:22.640
will be pierced through or they will be put in the jail, if they do these things.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.740
- [INTERPRETER]

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.540
- [INTERPRETER]

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.180
- but when they come to London, they drink like nobody's business.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.160
- [INTERPRETER]

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.880
They have all kinds of relationships which are very ugly.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:52.980
- [INTERPRETER]
- What happens to them that under fear

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:59.520
they work this way and under freedom they behave in a different manner.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:07.880
- [INTERPRETER]

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.920
- Same we can say about political theories.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.660
I went to Russia and Russian people in Russia

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.860
are quite alright under fear

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:32.660
- [INTERPRETER]
- but when they are given freedom

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:40.780
- when they are given freedom they behave like anybody else.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.660
And also in America if you go,

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.280
the freedom of people is abandonment.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:56.600
[INTERPRETER]

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:03.000
You can't walk on the street of New York with your purse in your hand.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:07.620
[INTERPRETER]

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.780
- They're all crazy people there.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:19.660
- Uh... they're so immature,
- [INTERPRETER]
- worse than children even.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.580
- Sometimes you can't understand them.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:31.860
About two years back we saw a feature from Hollywood

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.520
where they showed, very old -

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:41.440
about eighty - all the actors and actresses coming for a dance.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:48.060
[INTERPRETER]

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:53.700
They were very stupidly dressed with all their bones showing

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.280
[INTERPRETER]

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:03.320
- and they had come for a shake dance.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:09.360
Right from the Limousine when they were getting out they were already shaking.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.940
[INTERPRETER]

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:20.900
- So they try to compete with the young.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:27.380
- So there is no maturity in their freedom.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:35.660
Is such an abandonment of all the value system, all relationships, such impurities!

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.640
[INTERPRETER]

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:48.680
I went there in the year 1973 and told them about this AIDS will be coming very soon.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:54.900
- Well
- [INTERPRETER]

00:09:55.180 --> 00:10:02.960
- and all the homosexuals were so angry with Me - they were about to beat Me
- [INTERPRETER]

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:10.100
and even today, it's a martyrdom there for them to get this disease.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:15.740
[INTERPRETER]

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:21.860
- Schizophrenic are so common.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.360
- So what's the use of this freedom?
- [INTERPRETER]

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:33.060
- Man has no wisdom to use his freedom
- [INTERPRETER]

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:37.460
nor has he any wisdom to use his money.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:41.780
[INTERPRETER]

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:47.500
Anybody who gets an extra money, he goes to something which is self-destructive.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.400
[INTERPRETER]

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:58.760
The wisdom is so much lacking; There's no discrimination also

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:07.160
- [INTERPRETER]
 - to decide what is right for you and what is wrong for you.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:11.540
- [INTERPRETER]

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:18.200
So, under these circumstances, the religions, so called, also have to take the shape.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:23.640
- [INTERPRETER]

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.680
They are not religions in any way because

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.720
there is no enlightenment within.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.140
- [INTERPRETER]

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:41.140
- You do not become anything.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:47.720
In Sahaja yoga, we have Jews, we have Muslims, we have Christians, we have Hindus -

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:54.200
- people coming from all sides.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:59.340
- [INTERPRETER]
- but

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:06.240
- they do not fight, they do not quarrel,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:12.620
- there is no hankering after positions
- [INTERPRETER]

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:18.200
- because they can see themselves clearly.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:26.380
- and they can see others also very clearly
- [INTERPRETER]
- This is wisdom.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:32.480
- In the animal kingdom no animal kills another animal.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:38.200
- [INTERPRETER]
- Even a tiger doesn't kill another tiger

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:45.460
-  [INTERPRETER]
- There are certain qualities of a tiger, will remain with the tiger

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.380
[INTERPRETER]

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:54.740
But human-beings are so unpredictable because of their sense of freedom;

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.480
They could be a scorpion one day, tomorrow a tiger and third a serpent.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.480
[INTERPRETER]

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:08.820
[INTERPRETER]

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:15.240
What is the reason for this kind of absurd behaviour?

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.540
[INTERPRETER]

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.420
The reason is that we live with rationality

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:30.800
- [INTERPRETER]
- and not with logic.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:35.280
A, even if somebody murders someone, there's a rationality behind it.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.940
[INTERPRETER]

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:46.800
The logic can only come when you have achieved an Absolute sense.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:52.600
[INTERPRETER]

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.600
As you see here the flowers - everybody sees they're flowers here.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.560
[INTERPRETER]

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:06.980
Nobody is going to quarrel with them, whether it is flower or fruit

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.820
[INTERPRETER]

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:18.440
because they see it, absolutely they know it is flowers, everyone knows they are flowers.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:23.700
[INTERPRETER]

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:30.200
In the same way, unless and until you have knowledge of propriety,

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:35.380
of right and wrong, how will you say what is right, what is wrong.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:43.460
[INTERPRETER]

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.260
- One goes on compromising
- [INTERPRETER]
- with wrong

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:58.840
- [INTERPRETER]
- and thinks they are doing the best things in the world.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:05.260
- Everyone thinks they are the chosen ones of God.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:12.560
Jews thinks they are chosen ones, Muslims thinks they are chosen ones, the Christians think they are chosen ones

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:20.180
[INTERPRETER]

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:26.280
- These brands are not going to help anyone.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:31.900
- In the Bible, in the second verse of second chapter of Mathews,

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:38.340
Christ has clearly said, "You'll be calling Me, 'Christ, Christ,' I won't recognize you."

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:45.340
[INTERPRETER]

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:52.400
What is written between the lines is that, just by calling yourself that you are a follower of

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:59.480
this one and a follower of that and a follower of that, doesn't give you the right

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:04.880
to establish yourself as a religious person.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:11.120
[INTERPRETER]

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:15.860
[INTERPRETER]

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:25.580
- A religious person has a religion within himself
- [INTERPRETER]

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:34.980
- who has no temptations,
- [INTERPRETER]
- who has no weaknesses,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:41.460
- who doesn't consider money that important,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:48.900
- who is love and compassion and generosity,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:55.780
- who is peace [UNCLEAR]
- [INTERPRETER]
- Such a person

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:02.440
has the whole personality which is so auspicious.

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:09.600
- [INTERPRETER]
- Auspiciousness is a coefficience

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:18.240
- [INTERPRETER]
- which emits the rays of Divinity all around

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:25.840
- [INTERPRETER]
- and such a person wherever he goes or wherever he moves,

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:33.420
- he spreads auspiciousness.
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.300
- Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:43.000
- [INTERPRETER]

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:51.160
- How many Christians we'll find who don't have adulterous eyes?
- [INTERPRETER]

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:56.680
- It's a very subtle thing Christ has said.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:02.740
The eyes of a rich person has to be innocent,

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:08.660
- [INTERPRETER]
- devoid of lust and greed.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.320
- [INTERPRETER]

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:21.260
- He doesn't profess any religion whatsoever but He's religious
- [INTERPRETER]

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:28.680
and the eyes are so innocent that when such a person even looks at someone,

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:33.280
[INTERPRETER]

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:41.280
- he can bestow benevolence of that person.
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:49.540
This should happen then we can say that there is a person who has religion

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:54.740
built in his Central Nervous System - in his whole being.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:19:02.060
[INTERPRETER]

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:09.600
- But everybody can be in religion.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:17.520
Everybody can get to that state where he can

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:22.440
judge on an Absolute level.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:28.700
[INTERPRETER]

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:33.740
- We live in the world of relativity
- [INTERPRETER]

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:41.140
- but then we start living in the world of Absolute.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:48.540
Now somebody looks a very good person, he knows how to play flute, maybe or he's trying to be

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:56.540
- very nice and good outwardly, he can make gestures like a saint - how are you to make out?

00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:03.380
[INTERPRETER]

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.680
[INTERPRETER]

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:13.580
- There's a way.
- [INTERPRETER]
- When you're enlightened, then from your hands

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.760
- the vibrations of cool breeze flow.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:25.140
[INTERPRETER]

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:33.580
- You can feel on these finger-tips
-  [INTERPRETER]
- the centers.
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.140
- of another person
- [INTERPRETER]
- and if,

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:47.240
- supposing somebody has cancer
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:54.080
- you can feel that person on your finger-tips.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:20:54.540 --> 00:21:01.200
If you know how just to put the centers alright, you cure the person.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:06.080
- [INTERPRETER]

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:13.360
- So you jump into a new awareness
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:18.740
- higher than the human awareness - much higher -
- [INTERPRETER]

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:26.380
- of collective consciousness.
- [INTERPRETER]
- That you can feel others

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:33.000
- [INTERPRETER]
- and you can feel yourself.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:40.320
- But there are people who are still very limited and stupid.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:47.900
They identify themselves with some sort of an idea and get stuck with it

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:53.160
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:01.480
- but if you are an open-minded person,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:08.900
- I have to tell you the good news
-  [INTERPRETER]
- that all such people

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:15.940
-  [INTERPRETER]
- can become enlightened.
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:24.000
- You have to have purity of intelligence.
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:28.840
It's not brilliance that dazzles others or gives big lectures and all that

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:33.320
[INTERPRETER]

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:39.300
but pure intelligence means that sees directly the Truth

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:45.400
- [INTERPRETER]
- which is not

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:50.640
maligned or spoiled by ideologies

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:57.560
-  [INTERPRETER]
- and theories.
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:04.540
- The intelligence which is so loud
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:10.060
- or is a slave
-  [INTERPRETER]
- of other's domination
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:16.600
- cannot be pure intelligence.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:21.360
But today, as people are getting disillusioned

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:28.180
- [INTERPRETER]
- many honest and sincere people

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:33.740
-  [INTERPRETER]
- are there, seeking the Truth.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:38.060
- [INTERPRETER]
- And if you're honest

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:43.360
in your seeking, you will have to have it.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:51.060
- [INTERPRETER]
- That is your right 
- [INTERPRETER]

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:57.360
- that you have to get.
-  [INTERPRETER]
- Then you'll be surprised

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:01.180
that you'll transcend all limitations of the world.

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:07.540
[INTERPRETER]

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:16.180
- You won't have all these ideas which make you small;
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:21.480
- Like a drop becomes the ocean,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:25.780
that's how your personality becomes very great.

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:30.080
- [INTERPRETER]

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:37.620
I'm very fortunate that I'm born at a time when this special work has to be done.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:43.340
- [INTERPRETER]

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:49.720
Is mentioned in one of our old texts that, at the time when there will be

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.600
ghor Kaliyuga - means the worst time in the modern times -

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.740
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:06.860
- those people who are seeking the Truth
-  [INTERPRETER]
- in the jungles
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:11.480
- and in the Himalayas,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:19.780
- will find the Truth - their Kundalini will be awakened.
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:24.740
- And today that time has come.
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.500
You have been already explained about this - the knowledge of

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:41.000
-  the roots, the Spirit.
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:46.660
The Spirit is the Truth.

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:56.180
-  [INTERPRETER]
- Truth is the love -
-  [INTERPRETER]
- the pure love,

00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:04.500
-  [INTERPRETER]
- the All-Pervading love
- [INTERPRETER]
- and that you know through your Central Nervous System -

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:12.840
-  [INTERPRETER]
- not just by reading something
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:21.260
- but as you see the flowers,
-  [INTERPRETER]
- in the same way you know the Truth.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:27.820
- [INTERPRETER]
- The another thing is,

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:34.500
in the Nature of Spirit, it is the attention.

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:43.520
-  [INTERPRETER]
- That means the, when the Spirit enters into our attention,

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:52.080
- [INTERPRETER]
- our attention becomes enlightened.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:58.400
Sitting down here we can find out about anyone in the whole world.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:05.920
-  [INTERPRETER]
- She's asking, "Why getting human-beings [UNCLEAR] does it [UNCLEAR] their significance?"

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:09.120
- the meaning why they get it?

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:14.680
I was about to tell you today but he told Me that he's already talked about it, so I'll just now tell you.

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:22.020
[INTERPRETER]

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:27.400
- [INTERPRETER]
- but I'll tell you in short.

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:33.460
- Now here you see - just push forward everybody cannot see -

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.420
- [UNCLEAR]
- [INTERPRETER]

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:45.580
- What's she saying?
- She was asking, why the question is not answered - it will just start
- Annh?

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:49.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:58.240
- Now, this is what you are inside - let's see.
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:06.680
Now, on the left-hand side you see a blue line which is, what we call, is the

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:12.260
Moon channel or you can say the Left Sympathetic Nervous System.This channel gives

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:19.840
- energy to the Left Sympathetic Nervous System.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:27.320
- [INTERPRETER]
- and the another one is the right side one, which is

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:33.060
- yellow colored, goes up there and like a bile color it is,

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:41.660
-  [INTERPRETER]
- is called as the

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:49.260
- Sun line or Surya Naadi, which gives rise to the Right Sympathetic System.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:55.000
Now, the central one is the one what we call as the

00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:02.980
Sushumna - is the central path of ascent - which is actually gives, gives,

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:07.500
I mean, nourishes the Para-sympathetic Nervous system.

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:16.120
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:22.040
Now, in a human-being, out of his freedom

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:27.240
he can either go to any extreme of left or right.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:31.080
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:35.440
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:42.500
Supposing, he is over-active and futuristic and thinks too much and works too much

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:50.160
and physically, all the time, working out like jogging, this, that, all sorts of things,

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:57.520
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:03.620
- then he goes to the right side too much
-  [INTERPRETER]
- because he's futuristic,

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:10.600
-  [INTERPRETER]
- his feeling
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:18.860
- or he may be successful
- [INTERPRETER]
- and but he develops a tremendous thing called ego.

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:26.020
- [INTERPRETER]
- Ego is there that, 'I'm doing this and I'm doing that.'

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:32.740
-  [INTERPRETER]
- Actually, we're doing nothing.

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:38.800
-  [INTERPRETER]
- Whatever is dead we convert it;

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:43.420
Say the wood is dead, we make the roof - we think we make something great.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:49.520
[INTERPRETER]

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:53.220
[INTERPRETER]

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:58.580
- From dead to another dead
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:03.820
- or from whatever is dead matter, we try to discover something out of that
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:10.860
- and you use the energy of that
- [INTERPRETER]

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:17.460
but we cannot even create one little atom.

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:21.920
[INTERPRETER]

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:30.020
- This is the situation
- [INTERPRETER]
- but we think we're doing this, we're doing that.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:38.100
- [INTERPRETER]
- As we give stories of some Indian villagers going by plane -

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:45.140
- were told not to take too much luggage
- [INTERPRETER]

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:50.220
- [INTERPRETER]
- because the plane will feel heavy

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:57.300
- [INTERPRETER]
- so they took all the luggage in the plane but put it on their heads.

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:01.820
[LAUGHTER] [INTERPRETER]

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:07.600
They were asked, "Why do you do?" They said, "We're trying to reduce the weight of the plane."

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:13.860
[INTERPRETER]

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:19.920
- In the same way, we have our ego, we think that way.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:27.380
Now this over-activity on the right hand side - ego - harms others -

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:35.840
- [INTERPRETER]
- doesn't harm you
- [INTERPRETER]

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:43.700
- but physically can give you tremendous effects.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:49.880
First of all, as you see, it starts with that yellow second center, called as Swadhishthana,

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:57.940
-  [INTERPRETER]
- which is responsible, which is very much responsible

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:04.840
- for all kinds of physical and mental activities;
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:11.780
In the sense that it converts the fat cells of the stomach for the use of the brain

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:16.700
[INTERPRETER]

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:21.100
to replace the grey - there are cells - when we think too much.

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.960
[INTERPRETER]

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:31.740
So when we think too much, this poor chakra cannot look after other functions.

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:39.040
[INTERPRETER]

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:45.980
Another important work it has got, the liver, the pancreas, the spleen,

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:50.260
the kidney and with your intestines,

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:56.320
[INTERPRETER]

00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:04.520
- [INTERPRETER]
- the large intestine, the descending colon of the large intestine, they say.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.760
[INTERPRETER]

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:14.320
Now, when these things are neglected, the first thing you get is tremendous heat in the body.

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:21.060
- [INTERPRETER]
- Tremendous heat

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:26.080
because the liver is over-active

00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:33.060
- [INTERPRETER]
- Then we see heat passes

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:38.960
to higher side and one gets uh.. asthma

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:44.720
-  [INTERPRETER]
- because it melts the phlegm

00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:51.580
- It melts the phlegm, phlegm. Doctor, what do you say to the phlegm?

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:58.680
- Can't get, ment?
- [INTERPRETER]

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:05.120
As a result of that, you get hay fever, you get sneezing,

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:11.680
- you get running nose and you get asthma.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:18.960
-  [INTERPRETER]
- Of course, in the medicine, they don't say this.

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:25.480
-   [INTERPRETER]
- They only treat the symptoms - I'm telling you the root cause.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:29.620
[INTERPRETER]

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:35.200
Now, then on the other side, is the - you have got the pancreas.

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:41.160
- [INTERPRETER]
- The pancreas becomes over-active

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:47.740
- [INTERPRETER]
- so you develop diabetes.
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:54.340
You'll be amazed, that in India, in a village, people take so much sugar

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:58.280
that they say,  that the spoon must stand in the sugar.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:04.600
[INTERPRETER]

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:10.200
- Nobody gets diabetes
- [INTERPRETER]
- but if you think too much

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:16.520
all the energy is spent in thinking - you get diabetes; Specially

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.840
people who sit down and plan, plan, plan.

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:27.180
[INTERPRETER]

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:31.900
Then you have the third problem, which is more serious,

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:36.100
-  [INTERPRETER]
- is the spleen

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:42.500
which is like a speedometer, which keeps the rhythm of life with us.

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:51.800
- Speedome...
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:36:52.140 --> 00:37:00.100
-  [INTERPRETER]
- Now, the way we, our life is, what the life is - we invite shocks.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:08.680
- [INTERPRETER]
- Early in the morning, we see the newspaper.

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:15.060
-  [INTERPRETER]
- Finished. Horrible news, horrible things.

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:23.160
- This one fighting, that one killing that - all horrible things.
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:28.580
This poor spleen has to produce more Red blood corpuscles

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:37.180
- [INTERPRETER]
- for emergency.
- [INTERPRETER]
- So under shock it starts producing more RBC's

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:45.460
-  [INTERPRETER]
- Then you eat your food in a hurry,  your breakfast you push it in the mouth, somehow

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:50.780
- [INTERPRETER]
- because all the time you wasted in newspaper reading

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:56.120
-  [INTERPRETER]
- so you have no time to have  your breakfast.

00:37:56.420 --> 00:38:03.240
- [INTERPRETER]
- You get into the car and then you find a jam - finished.

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:10.160
- [INTERPRETER]
- Then you're breaking your head with worrying.

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:16.660
- [INTERPRETER]
- Again another shock to poor spleen.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:24.320
It goes on producing RBC's without any rhythm in it - it becomes hectic.

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:29.880
- [INTERPRETER]
- It is such a hectic life you lead

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:38.020
- [INTERPRETER]
- Formerly, in the times of My father, I remember, My father used to come

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:45.560
for, get up very early, go for his film and have his breakfast on the table

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:50.540
and My mother would be fanning him and he would eat with that rhythm.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:58.740
[INTERPRETER]

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:02.880
My mother used to give him that rhythm - I used to feel.

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:09.260
[INTERPRETER]

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:15.400
- [INTERPRETER]
- but nowadays you're so very hectic,

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:22.180
- [INTERPRETER]
- slaves of our watch,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:28.600
- every time trying to reach in time.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:34.500
I've known people, if you just tell them that, "I have to go to the airport," they go crazy.

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:42.360
- [INTERPRETER]
- "I have to go not you," but still they're crazy.

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:46.600
[INTERPRETER]

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.160
And they'll go on telling, "Now time go." "I am going but why are you worried, I am going you are not going."

00:39:52.540 --> 00:40:00.040
[INTERPRETER]

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:06.440
This kind of behaviour spoils the rhythm of our being.

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:11.840
[INTERPRETER]

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:20.220
Then is the big problem; The vulnerability is established

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:24.800
in the spleen and you get blood cancer.

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:33.040
[INTERPRETER]

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:37.460
But the cancer is pathological - it comes from the left side;

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:41.740
[INTERPRETER]

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:48.800
In the sense, it is triggered by the left side by some proteins.

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:52.500
[INTERPRETER]

00:40:54.020 --> 00:41:02.020
- But the vulnerability can come from the right side or from the left side.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:08.120
Now, if you go too much to the left also, there are problems like that.

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:15.240
- [INTERPRETER]
- I must have given, at least, hundred lectures on this.

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:18.780
You can get My tapes and find for yourself

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:25.180
[INTERPRETER]

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.560
- in all details.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:35.120
But in this short time, I think, I have already told you not to have a futuristic mind.

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:41.560
[INTERPRETER]

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:45.640
- Try to be in the present.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:51.540
Not only it is happening in our everyday life

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.020
but also in religious life I've seen it happens.

00:41:55.560 --> 00:42:00.960
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:07.620
When Shri Rama came on this earth, they said, "We believe only in Parshurama," because he's dead now - finished.

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:12.540
- If he's dead, it's better to believe a person who's dead.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:16.380
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:23.140
Then Shri Krishna came, they said, "We don't believe in you. We believe in Shri Rama," because He's dead.

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:30.760
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:36.460
- They never want to believe in something that is living today
- [INTERPRETER]

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:44.540
- from where you can gain.
- [INTERPRETER]
- They want to believe in something that is dead and finished

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:50.920
- [INTERPRETER]
- because you can keep such a person in the pocket.

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:56.400
- [INTERPRETER]
- Nobody is going to ask you.

00:42:56.740 --> 00:43:00.820
If Christ is not living, He's not going to say, "Why did you do this wrong?"

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:05.280
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:10.140
So, people don't want to take anything in the present but present is the Truth.

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:15.700
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:21.980
The past is finished and the future doesn't exist, so why not get it in the present moment.

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:28.080
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:34.820
Because we cannot live in the present moment with the temperant life, we get into troubles -

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:42.460
physical, mental, emotional, uh.. material, economic, political - all kinds.

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:50.600
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:59.920
- So, how to come to the center?
- [INTERPRETER]
- The Kundalini

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:08.120
goes through your centers and brings you in one line.

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:14.520
- [INTERPRETER]

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:20.760
- She integrates you
- [INTERPRETER]
- but this knowledge is difficult to digest.

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:27.000
- [INTERPRETER]
- One of the reasons is, I'm living.

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:34.240
- [INTERPRETER]
- When I will be dead, then you might build temples for Me.

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:41.620
- [INTERPRETER]
- But just now in your time, I'm telling you

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:47.900
- then you won't accept,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:54.100
- you won't try to understand and learn.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:58.580
- This is human nature
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:07.480
and this is the reason why all the people, who came on this earth, could not give realization to anyone of them.

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:13.780
[INTERPRETER]

00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:19.380
Even the Christ disciples felt the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost when He was dead.

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:25.080
[INTERPRETER]

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:29.440
- Till the end they were doubting Him.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:35.940
- They were doubting His Immaculate conception.
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:44.220
- God is miraculous.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:51.620
- You have to see those miracles after sahaja yoga.
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:56.940
- One after another - you'll be amazed.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:03.380
- But one has to rise to that awareness.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:10.700
Now, one of them I told you one side but the another side is weakened, becomes Schizophrenic man

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:17.660
[INTERPRETER]

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:24.300
- and all the pathological problems
- [INTERPRETER]
- come from the left side.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:34.300
I think, this has taken too much time, this answering so I claim, I cannot answer.

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:40.660
[INTERPRETER]

00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:51.640
[GERMAN?]

00:46:53.760 --> 00:47:01.680
[GERMAN?]

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:08.420
[GERMAN?]

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:15.340
[GERMAN?]

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:19.280
[GERMAN?]

00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:26.180
- [UNCLEAR]
- Shri Krishna, Shree Mataji is the One.
- [SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:33.760
You should have written them down and I had said that, if you give Me the questions, I will answer them

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:41.440
when I have to speak but nobody gave Me any questions - I didn't know what to answer; Yesterday I said so.

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:48.220
- Now there is not so much time, Sir but let's see what is
- There are three questions.

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:54.880
[SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS] You tell him that yesterday I had said, that if you have any questions,

00:47:55.100 --> 00:48:01.240
then you write them down and then hand it over to Me and then in My speech, I will answer them.

00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:06.780
Now, you see the time is up and again their Nabhi, their

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:10.500
spleen will become hectic.

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:16.420
[INTERPRETER]

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:19.840
[INTERPRETER]

00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:27.560
Now, I will be very happy if you could write down those questions for Me and I'll answer them; I promise you.

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:33.540
[INTERPRETER]

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:38.140
But all the people are now anxious to have their realization.

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:43.020
[INTERPRETER]

00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:51.000
[GERMAN]

00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:59.160
He's saying Shree Mataji, he's saying that You said, "We have time for questions."

00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:03.460
But up to a point. I cannot go on the whole night, Sir.

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:12.840
Because they never ask any questions, though there's nothing to fight. There isn't so much time. Please be seated. I'll answer all your questions.

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:17.680
Please. I told yesterday that you give all your questions.

00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:25.180
You should have given Me all your questions when I arrived but no questions till I said, "Alright, let's have one or two questions."

00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:29.940
Alright? Please be seated. I agree with you, I should have answered but

00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:36.200
you have three questions and I'll answer all of them, so now be satisfied, please be seated - thank you.

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:43.780
[INTERPRETER]

00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:48.420
- [INTERPRETER]
- You should write it down and give it to Me.

00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:54.660
I promise you, I'll send you a letter of answering your questions.

00:49:55.540 --> 00:50:01.240
[INTERPRETER]

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:13.660
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:21.300
So now, those who want to have their Self-realization, have to

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:25.600
[AUDIENCE]

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:33.800
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:43.240
Yes, that is what I think but he doesn't understand that, you see. Doesn't matter but we'll try if we can give him Self-realization.

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:47.540
- If it works out, very good; All his questions will be answered in any case.

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:54.880
- [INTERPRETER]

00:50:55.780 --> 00:51:03.840
It doesn't happen on mental level, you see, it is something, a living process that takes place within. It's not a mental level thing.

00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:12.640
[INTERPRETER]

00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:20.440
One can, at the most, take you to that part or tell you but you have to have it yourself.

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:24.840
[INTERPRETER]

00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:31.780
Now, those people who want to have realization

00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:36.100
should sit here otherwise, I cannot force it on you.

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:43.220
- [INTERPRETER]
- is your sweet will.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.280
[INTERPRETER]

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:52.900
It will take about ten minutes or fifteen minutes - is your sweet will -

00:51:53.780 --> 00:52:00.740
- [INTERPRETER]
- and those who do not want to have, should leave the hall.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:09.680
[INTERPRETER]

00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:13.680
People don't like others to look at them when they are meditating.

00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:18.280
[INTERPRETER]

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:28.960
- Now those people, who are standing, can also sit here - there's room here.
- [INTERPRETER]
- There's some room here

00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:34.100
Please be seated. Be comfortable. Please be seated - there's room here.

00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:53.600
- Here, there is some room here.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:16.560
It's very simple, please. You have to do as we did yesterday.

00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:23.460
But those who got realization yesterday, they will re-establish it properly

00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:29.960
and the ones who haven't got it, will get it today, I hope.

00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:37.160
[INTERPRETER]

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:43.580
[INTERPRETER]

00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:48.120
[INTERPRETER]

00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:51.560
We also have a workshop for you.

00:53:52.500 --> 00:54:00.080
- [INTERPRETER]
- You're not to give any money to anyone,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:05.680
- there's no business going on.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:12.100
- You can go and ask them what you want to ask
- [INTERPRETER]

00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:19.540
- and they will work on you and explain to you.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:25.680
In such a short time, these Austrians have become so knowledgeable

00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:31.460
[INTERPRETER]

00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:38.880
- in the same way, you all could become very knowledgeable.
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:42.900
And all this knowledge is available to you because it is your own.

00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:48.820
[INTERPRETER]

00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:52.940
And the new revolution of a very peaceful type

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:58.140
within us, is working out in the whole humanity only.

00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:03.500
[INTERPRETER]

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:07.260
[INTERPRETER]

00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:12.200
- which will manifest
- [INTERPRETER]
- all over

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:16.180
- [INTERPRETER]
- and as I told you,

00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:22.040
that the One who has created this world will not allow this world to be destroyed.

00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:28.780
- [INTERPRETER]

00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:38.720
Now, I have to make one humble request, is to take out the shoes, to take the help of the Mother Earth, for a while.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:43.920
- [INTERPRETER]

00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:51.200
Apart from that, shoes are different styles, so it's better.

00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:56.260
- [INTERPRETER]

00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:02.660
- Now, put both the feet on the Mother Earth
-  [INTERPRETER]

00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:09.380
so the Mother Earth sucks in the left and right side problems within us.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:16.380
- [INTERPRETER]

00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:22.460
Automatically she sucks in when we start feeling the All-Pervading [power]

00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:28.600
- [INTERPRETER]

00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:37.320
So, the first thing that happens to you, that when the Kundalini crosses this center

00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:41.100
you become absolutely peaceful, without thoughts.

00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:48.360
- [INTERPRETER]

00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:53.600
- You become thoughtlessly aware.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:56:54.620 --> 00:57:00.100
That means, at this center ego and the superego, the conditioning, is sucked in.

00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:08.040
[INTERPRETER]

00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:13.740
You can think, if you want to but no thoughts can invade you.

00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:20.040
[INTERPRETER]

00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:26.960
Then you feel the cool breeze emitting out of your own head

00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:31.920
[INTERPRETER]

00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:39.120
- which you have to feel yourself.
- [INTERPRETER]
- You have to give yourself a certificate.

00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:43.980
[INTERPRETER]

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:48.940
- You have to be convinced about yourself.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:55.600
And then you start feeling the cool breeze, all over, in your hands

00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:59.260
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:07.080
but sometimes, this center if it is not alright, you may not feel

00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:15.420
though you may get your realization but you may not feel on your finger-tips, if this center is catching, the nerves are little dead, then you may not feel.

00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:20.520
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:26.620
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:32.300
- [INTERPRETER]
- But with little practice, you do.

00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:36.840
- [INTERPRETER]

00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:42.900
Practise means, understanding where is the problem is and how to remove the hurdles, you get it.

00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:49.720
- [INTERPRETER]

00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:59.720
Now, as we are going to use our left hand to express our power of desire, like this on your lap

00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:06.520
comfortably you have to sit but little straight - not like this or like that but straight

00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:14.760
- [INTERPRETER]

00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:19.460
- [INTERPRETER]

00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:27.480
and the, and the, if there's anything tight, the waist or in the  neck or anything, you can loosen it.

00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:33.560
- [INTERPRETER]

00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:39.600
- In short, you should be comfortable.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:47.080
The right hand should be used for nourishing or

00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:50.960
helping the Kundalini, by putting on different chakras.

00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:59.480
[INTERPRETER]

00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:03.800
- All of you must do it.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:08.260
- It's very simple.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:15.420
Now, I'll show you and then, later on, we can close the eyes and do the meditation.

01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:23.240
[INTERPRETER]

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:29.760
- First we put the right hand on the heart,
- [INTERPRETER]

01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:33.620
where is the reflection of the Spirit.

01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:38.640
- [INTERPRETER]
- You can put it under the coat.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:46.420
- [INTERPRETER]
- It's very good; So many people have heart troubles and things -

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:51.180
is a very good thing to put your right hand on your heart.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:55.980
[INTERPRETER]

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:02.200
Now, second

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:10.020
center we have to attend to, is in the upper part of the abdomen, on the left hand side.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.760
[INTERPRETER]

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:21.420
- upper part of the abdomen on the left hand side.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:29.560
- This gentleman doesn't want to do it so let him go away.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:35.980
Please. You're already looking not well, why don't you do it?

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:40.660
[INTERPRETER]

01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:47.700
- [AUDIENCE]
- He says it's his freedom
- Annh?
- It's his freedom not to do it.

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:55.480
- Annh?
- It's his freedom - doesn't want to do
- Yes, but here others have the freedom that they don't want you to see them;

01:01:56.060 --> 01:02:03.080
- Let them have the freedom.
- [INTERPRETER]
- You should respect their freedom now.

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:06.680
- [INTERPRETER]
- Who likes others to watch them?

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:12.640
[INTERPRETER]

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:20.080
- [INTERPRETER]
- You have to respect their freedom.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:25.640
- Alright?
- Alright.

01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:32.100
Thank you. When they close eyes, you'll have to close eyes also.

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:41.680
- We have no right to disturb other people.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:47.820
They have come for their Self-realization and they have their right to have it

01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:54.080
[INTERPRETER]

01:02:54.760 --> 01:03:00.060
- and it would be sinful to disturb them.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:05.900
- So I would request you not to disturb them.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:16.020
[AUDIENCE UNCLEAR]

01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:26.100
Now, please put this right hand in the lower part of your abdomen.

01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:31.240
[INTERPRETER]

01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:42.540
This is the center of your Divine work.

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:50.000
- [INTERPRETER]
- so you have to have in your consciousness

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:58.660
the knowledge of the technique.

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:05.200
- [INTERPRETER]

01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:10.280
Like, when I have to hold something, I know what to do with My consciousness

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:16.280
[INTERPRETER]

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:21.260
In the same way, you have to have the Pure Knowledge in your consciousness

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:26.100
[INTERPRETER]

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:32.840
- and this is the center that works it out.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:39.580
Then you go back on your stomach, on the left hand side of the abdomen.

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:45.120
[INTERPRETER]

01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:51.440
- This is the center of your mastery.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:57.780
- You have to be the master -
- [INTERPRETER]
- master of yourself.

01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:05.120
- [INTERPRETER]
- No slave of any stupidity
- [INTERPRETER]

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:11.160
or of any habit or any kind of temptation

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:18.460
[INTERPRETER]

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:25.440
- and you have to be the master of the knowledge.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:32.200
- So this is a very important center within us.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:41.280
- Now, put this hand back on to your heart
- [INTERPRETER]

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:45.340
- where resides the Spirit.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:53.880
Now, this center is very important, about which I was told, you have been informed - is the center, what we call, the Left Vishuddhi,

01:05:54.160 --> 01:06:00.540
on the left hand side, here - between the neck and this shoulder - in this corner.

01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:08.540
To push the hand that side and turn your head to your right and push your hand, as much as you can, on the back side.

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:14.940
[INTERPRETER]

01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:21.140
[INTERPRETER]

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:27.360
Now, this center is caught up when you have a guilt or you think, "I'm guilty."

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:32.120
[INTERPRETER]

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:36.700
- Nobody has to feel guilty at all,
- [INTERPRETER]

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:40.840
- nobody has to feel diffident also.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:47.880
This catch gives you diseases like angina, also spondylitis.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:54.520
This catch gives you diseases like angina and spondylitis.

01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:00.760
[INTERPRETER]

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:09.300
So it's better that you put your hands here, clearly you put your head this side when we do our meditation later on, when I tell you.

01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:15.480
[INTERPRETER]

01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:18.740
Now, please you have to put your hand on your forehead.

01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:25.240
- [INTERPRETER]
- Right hand, right hand
- [INTERPRETER]
- Left hand is towards Me

01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:32.060
- [INTERPRETER]
- Right hand - now press it on both the sides
-  [INTERPRETER]

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:37.200
- and press it hard
- [INTERPRETER]
- Now

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:45.340
you have to put your hand on the back side of your head and put the load of your head slowly on to it.

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:53.620
[INTERPRETER]

01:07:54.300 --> 01:08:00.980
- Lastly, you have to stretch your hand.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:09.540
Stretch your hand and you will have to put your center of your hand on top of your head

01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:16.020
in the fontanel bone area, where it was a soft bone, for your final baptism.

01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:23.640
[INTERPRETER]

01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:31.700
This was a soft bone in your childhood and you stretch your fingers up and press the thing down.

01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:37.440
- Slowly move your scalp, seven times,
- [INTERPRETER]
- clockwise

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:42.700
[INTERPRETER]

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:50.240
- [INTERPRETER]
- slowly.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:56.000
- That's all.
- [INTERPRETER]
- This is time when we have to look to ourselves, not to others.

01:08:56.780 --> 01:09:01.360
[INTERPRETER]

01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:06.220
[INTERPRETER]

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:10.300
At least keep your eyes shut because the attention has to go inside.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:16.100
[INTERPRETER]

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:23.200
- Till I tell you, please don't open your eyes.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:29.280
- You have to gain something - nothing has to be gained by Me
- [INTERPRETER]

01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:37.220
- so, be kind to yourself.
- [INTERPRETER]
- It's for your benevolence.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:44.160
Alright. So, if you put your left hand towards Me

01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:52.580
- [INTERPRETER]
- and both the feet on the ground, straight
- [INTERPRETER]
-  and sit little straight

01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:58.920
- [INTERPRETER]
- and close your eyes.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:04.400
First thing we do, is to put our right hand on our heart.

01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:08.900
[INTERPRETER]

01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:18.940
Here, is the Spirit so, you please ask Me a very fundamental question -

01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:23.300
you may call Me Shree Mataji or Mother -

01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:29.100
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" Ask this fundamental question three times.

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:36.180
[INTERPRETER]

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:41.640
[INTERPRETER]

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.480
[Aside - You may turn it little bit, too much]. Now,

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:14.380
Please put your right hand

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:22.940
on the upper part of your abdomen, on the left hand side, please.

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:28.940
[INTERPRETER]

01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:42.200
- Now here, is a very important center
- [INTERPRETER]

01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:50.020
and you have to ask Me a very fundamental question, which is followed by the first one.

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:56.700
[INTERPRETER]

01:11:57.420 --> 01:12:02.400
If you are your Spirit, you are your master too

01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:06.720
[INTERPRETER]

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:11.680
so, please ask Me a question

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:18.260
"Mother, am I my own master," ask this question, three times, please.

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:24.120
[INTERPRETER]

01:12:52.360 --> 01:13:00.060
Now, please hold your right hand in the lower part of your abdomen,

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:03.840
on the left hand side - keep the left hand towards Me.

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:09.780
[INTERPRETER]

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:14.040
[INTERPRETER]

01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:21.980
- This is the center of pure knowledge
- [INTERPRETER]

01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:28.760
- but I cannot force on you.
- [INTERPRETER]
- In your freedom you have to ask for it

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:35.120
- [INTERPRETER]
- so, please ask six times,

01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:38.920
"Mother, may I have the pure knowledge?

01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:45.840
- [INTERPRETER]

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:50.880
Six times because this center has got six petals.

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:55.040
- [INTERPRETER]

01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:17.600
By asking this question, the Kundalini has started, uh..She is awakened.

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:22.460
- [INTERPRETER]

01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:30.580
To help Her cross all the centers properly, you put your right hand

01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:35.300
on the left hand side of your stomach, in the upper part

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:42.520
- [INTERPRETER]

01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:48.480
- [INTERPRETER]
- Here, with full confidence,

01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:54.820
please say ten times, "Mother, I am my own master,

01:14:55.080 --> 01:15:02.480
I am my own guru, I am my guide," say this ten times.

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:08.140
[INTERPRETER]

01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:11.820
[INTERPRETER]

01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:47.560
Now, raise your hand on your heart

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:55.660
- [INTERPRETER]
- and here, we have to see the greatest truth

01:15:56.580 --> 01:16:03.060
- [INTERPRETER]
- so now, with full confidence in yourself

01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:09.280
please say, "Mother, I am the Spirit." Please say twelve times.

01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:15.920
[INTERPRETER]

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:49.880
Now, we have to know that the Divine is the ocean and love,

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:53.760
ocean of love and Grace

01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:59.440
[INTERPRETER]

01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:04.100
but above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness

01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:09.280
[INTERPRETER]

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:16.920
and whatever mistakes you commit, is capable of completely neutralizing it.

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:23.940
[INTERPRETER]

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:28.800
So, have faith in the power of forgiveness of the Divine.

01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:32.440
[INTERPRETER]

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:39.700
So, raise your right hand in the corner

01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:46.080
of your shoulder and your neck and place your right hand,

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:53.140
- head towards the right.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:17:54.260 --> 01:18:01.700
- [INTERPRETER]
- Now here, forgive yourself
- [INTERPRETER]
- and say,

01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:08.200
"Mother, I am not guilty at all," sixteen times.

01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:13.520
[INTERPRETER]

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:20.260
Now, if you still feel guilty, then better punish yourself by saying 108 times.

01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:28.100
[INTERPRETER]

01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:33.920
- You should be pleasantly placed towards yourself
- [INTERPRETER]

01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:40.080
- because you're entering into the kingdom of God.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:46.260
So now, say it sixteen times, "I am not at all guilty."

01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:50.120
[INTERPRETER]

01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:59.160
Now, raise your right hand to your forehead, across.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:05.380
- [INTERPRETER]
- Put your left hand towards Me.

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:11.240
- [INTERPRETER]
- Now, press on both the sides.

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:19.560
- [INTERPRETER]
- On this center you have to say, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:24.520
- [INTERPRETER]

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:29.860
- Now, some people think, it's difficult
- [INTERPRETER]

01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:35.760
- but it is a myth, whether you forgive or don't forgive
- [INTERPRETER]

01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:40.800
but if you do not forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:45.840
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:49.580
- So, from your heart you have to say, not how many times,

[INTERPRETER]

01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:59.040
- "I forgive everyone."
- [INTERPRETER]

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:05.460
- Now, take your hand on your back side
-  [INTERPRETER]

01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:12.320
and put your head on that and put the load of your head, slowly,

01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:17.120
[INTERPRETER]

01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:24.260
Here, for your own satisfaction, you have to say, "O Divine,

01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:32.420
if I've done any mistakes, please forgive me," but only for your satisfaction, not to feel guilty or counting your mistakes.

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:41.060
[INTERPRETER]

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:50.660
- Now, please stretch your hand, right hand
- [INTERPRETER]

01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:58.940
- left hand towards Me
- [INTERPRETER]
- and both the feet on the Mother Earth.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:04.320
Now, put the center of your palm on the fontanel bone area.

01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:09.700
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:17.900
- Now, press it hard
- [INTERPRETER]
- and you have to move it seven times, slowly, clockwise,

01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:25.400
-  [INTERPRETER]
- Here also I cannot force you

01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:32.040
so you have to say seven times, "Mother, please give me my realization."

01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:39.600
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:47.660
- If you like, you can bend your head a little - it will make it easier
- [INTERPRETER]

01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:54.540
-  [INTERPRETER]
- Now, press it hard,
-  [INTERPRETER]
- stretch your fingers

- Very few have not felt
- [INTERPRETER]
- but we have

01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:53.460
a workshop - please, please, please all of you should go

01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:59.560
clarify yourself, grow yourself out

- You have to grow
-  [INTERPRETER]
- that's the important part
-  [INTERPRETER]

01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:32.620
otherwise, next year you'll come and tell Me that, "Mother, I've got cancer, I've got this, I've got that."
