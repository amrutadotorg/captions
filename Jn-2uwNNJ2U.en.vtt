WEBVTT

00:00:02.162 --> 00:00:07.062
Today we have gathered here to worship Shiva.

00:00:09.145 --> 00:00:26.425
Many hymns have been written about Shiva and the
Great Shiva is said to have various methods
(UNCLEAR - sacramental?) and deeds/work done.

00:00:27.518 --> 00:00:39.738
The biggest blessing of Shiva is that because of
Him we all are enunciated/placed here today.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:53.793
Because of Him our existence is, that's why
we should thank That Shiva who gave us a
vision/sight towards Him.

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:06.729
The manifestation of this material life
is supported by Brahma, Ganesha and Vishnu.

00:01:06.755 --> 00:01:26.935
But its destination is that of Shiva as well,
moving towards Whom we must first
acquire the qualities of Shiva.

00:01:28.393 --> 00:01:44.423
His foremost quality is forgiveness. He is
nothing but forgiveness, but which path
should we take to achieve that forgiveness?

00:01:44.423 --> 00:01:58.475
Misuse, He forgave many demons and gave blessings
to them but it was misused by the demons.

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:14.641
Then those demons are reborn with their
demonic (UNCLEAR) and they...

00:02:16.395 --> 00:02:29.115
We should emulate His forgiveness
and not His (UNCLEAR).

00:02:29.132 --> 00:02:39.362
When people come to Sahaja Yoga, they do not
understand how much enlightenment and love
they have received.

00:02:39.676 --> 00:02:53.266
One must first love. When love completely
blossoms in a person, then detachment
/neutrality comes in him.

00:02:53.697 --> 00:03:08.267
When a person loves everything, loves everyone,
he fills them all within himself, but he
is not absorbed/engrossed by anyone.

00:03:08.267 --> 00:03:18.045
As is the case with ordinary people, they get
engrossed in small things by saying,
'This is mine, this is mine.'

00:03:18.107 --> 00:03:24.587
They will fight for it, lose their
self-respect for it,

00:03:24.587 --> 00:03:30.527
will do all kinds of such activities for it
which will later on make them feel ashamed.

00:03:31.704 --> 00:03:39.194
But the person who loves everything
remains untouched by it.

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.509
Means he will always keep blessing that thing.

00:03:44.878 --> 00:03:56.358
He will always have a worthy feeling towards it.
He will think that that person is being
(UNCLEAR - harmed?) through me.

00:03:56.358 --> 00:04:05.308
Like a father spoils his child, then
he does not love him, he harms him.

00:04:05.365 --> 00:04:16.755
The biggest rule is that love should be
benevolent. If love is harming the child,
then it is not love.

00:04:18.948 --> 00:04:31.368
It should be known that Shiva has powers that
flow within us, and therefore His love is
limitless/boundless.

00:04:31.368 --> 00:04:46.644
It is true that He loved demons as well.
But He has a third eye which can reduce
all the demons to ashes at once.

00:04:46.716 --> 00:04:55.136
You don't have such an eye. So in the
beginning, love simple and easy going people.

00:04:55.136 --> 00:05:02.837
Then love the difficult people. Loving
monsters/demons is not a beneficial thing.

00:05:03.745 --> 00:05:10.615
You should be indifferent to demons. Even to
fight with them - they are demons after all.

00:05:10.615 --> 00:05:14.685
So getting angry with them will only
increase your ego.

00:05:14.685 --> 00:05:20.429
Therefore, your loving sight towards them
should be such that you remain indifferent.

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:26.676
Or you should have a type of compassion
for them, "Oh, what is it, they are devils."

00:05:26.957 --> 00:05:32.237
And you are sitting in the Kingdom,
and these people are demons.

00:05:32.336 --> 00:05:38.156
When this feeling awakens within you, then
the principle of Shiva will be awakened.

00:05:38.844 --> 00:05:49.364
Shiva is the embodiment of love, He is
love personified and there should be
surrender in love, devotion and knowledge.

00:05:49.364 --> 00:05:55.746
Suppose you have devotion towards someone,
you believe in someone and you get to know

00:05:55.746 --> 00:06:00.829
that this man is very wicked
and he takes a lot of our money,

00:06:00.829 --> 00:06:05.880
he has troubled me in such and such a way,
then all your love will be lost for him,

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:13.163
you will lose your faith in him. Thus love
is generated from knowledge and devotion as well.

00:06:13.163 --> 00:06:20.356
Means in knowledge you know what the
truth is, and when you do devotion
towards that truth,

00:06:20.356 --> 00:06:35.143
knowing that truth when you have faith in it,
that is, when you are devoted in the light
of that Truth, then you know what love is.

00:06:35.143 --> 00:06:41.536
Loving any human being blindly, having
blind love for anyone, is not acceptable
to Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:41.536 --> 00:06:47.642
For Me too, until you have gained/received
something, why do you come on My feet.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:55.750
When you have not known anything then
it's not proper for you to believe in Me.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:04.575
You must first know what I am, you must
first fully attain/receive that Truth,

00:07:04.575 --> 00:07:11.755
you must know it within yourself in your
consciousness, and then your devotion
will have some meaning.

00:07:11.755 --> 00:07:17.354
Otherwise, by saying, ‘Mataji, Mataji,
Mataji,’ Mataji will not have any
relationship/connection with you.

00:07:17.489 --> 00:07:25.029
But you will only be connected when
you know what is the Truth about Mataji.

00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:32.408
Touch the feet only after knowing that
truth. Even now when we went there,
a lady came on My feet.

00:07:32.408 --> 00:07:42.019
There is no benefit from that. You don't
know anything about Me, you don't understand
anything (UNCLEAR) then why My (UNCLEAR)

00:07:44.799 --> 00:07:50.679
In our Maharashtra, people are suffering from
a disease of giving them My darshan/sight.

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:56.524
If I don't allow them to see Me, then
it's all over, then they think that
I have made them completely a pauper.

00:07:58.159 --> 00:08:05.889
This is not the case. Eligibility to
take darshan or being entitled to
go somewhere does not mean that

00:08:05.889 --> 00:08:11.852
I have challenged your ego or I
have defied your ego.

00:08:11.852 --> 00:08:20.590
This simply means that the faith to
receive the Darshan has not yet
been awakened in you.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:24.503
This means that you might have
devotion towards Mataji,

00:08:24.503 --> 00:08:28.577
but you haven't really known Her truly,
so why touch Her feet?

00:08:28.577 --> 00:08:34.698
By doing this you can correct/clear this
question once for all that you will
never touch the feet of other Gurus;

00:08:34.698 --> 00:08:36.548
First know the truth about them.

00:08:36.548 --> 00:08:41.232
See their few disciples, what is
their behaviour, then know this.

00:08:41.232 --> 00:08:56.319
So what is called Shraddha(Devotion), that is Shiva's
presence in the devotees; He resides in the devotees
in the form of devotion and then it should be said,

00:08:59.439 --> 00:09:10.110
now how much balance there is in this
faith - but very few people have the
balance of the principle of Shiva.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:19.184
Because He is The Unseen, He has never
incarnated, after knowing Him (UNCLEAR)

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:34.770
So more than that, what is called its
joy, because how else should one
know That One desirous thing?

00:09:35.866 --> 00:09:47.726
The reflection of the Spirit in our heart is
Shiva Himself. And the reflection of this
Spirit gradually manifests itself.

00:09:47.726 --> 00:09:51.777
Now you have found the Spirit in the
form of Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:51.917 --> 00:09:57.177
In Sahaja Yoga you have known, verified
and witnessed your Shiva principle.

00:09:57.177 --> 00:10:02.564
After understanding that Truth
you have now reached this state,

00:10:02.564 --> 00:10:08.018
that with faith and the support of this Truth,
you can do anything.

00:10:08.018 --> 00:10:19.090
But as soon as your faith, as your
sight became subtle,

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:27.571
As soon as you were able to know
(UNCLEAR - possible?), in the same way
Shiva's powers also got manifested.

00:10:28.231 --> 00:10:39.761
So, at the time when the principle had to be
sacrificed or explained, Shiva came to our
void in the form of a Guru (UNCLEAR).

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:49.580
In today's time we should know that
Shiva is the Rudra.

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:57.386
One of His powers is Rudra Shakti.
Out of them, eleven Rudras are
active/functional today.

00:10:58.467 --> 00:11:07.437
Those who will work against Sahaja Yoga
will be affected by this Rudra.

00:11:07.437 --> 00:11:17.611
Those who come to Sahaja Yoga and show
demonic tendencies will be affected
by this Ekadasha Rudra.

00:11:18.128 --> 00:11:24.638
The first thing you know is that Ekadasa
Rudra is very predominant in Cancer.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:36.380
Similarly, those people who come to Sahaja Yoga
and then quarrel amongst themselves,
create animosity in one another,

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:44.759
will show enmity, or will not have the awareness
of Sahaja Yoga, will not participate in it,

00:11:44.759 --> 00:11:50.658
or those who do not come to the collective,
the power of Ekadasha will be activated for them.

00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:59.341
As much as it is helpful to you, to the same
extent Shiva's power is destructive for you.

00:11:59.566 --> 00:12:05.026
Because Shiva's power is helpful to you
it will take you to a deeper level,

00:12:05.026 --> 00:12:12.468
it will fill you with love and the greatest
thing, it will bring joy to your life,

00:12:12.468 --> 00:12:19.610
It will fill very pore of yours with joy;
every moment of yours will be blissful.
This is the power of Shiva,

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:28.963
but when you go against Shiva,
betray Shiva, then this very power

00:12:28.963 --> 00:12:33.823
it will give you the antidote(Maarak), which
we call centripetal and centrifugal force.

00:12:35.175 --> 00:12:44.505
So the power which has attracted you, the
power that has made you (UNCLEAR) will
leave you and you will become (UNCLEAR).

00:12:45.185 --> 00:12:51.425
So as you progress, accordingly you
should stick to Sahaja Yoga very closely.

00:12:51.881 --> 00:12:57.901
Sahaja Yoga has its doors open for all kinds
of people. Whoever wants can come into this.

00:12:57.919 --> 00:13:01.699
This does not mean that every person
is a Sahaja Yogi later on.

00:13:01.699 --> 00:13:05.682
Any person can walk around with the label
of Sahaja Yoga saying he is a Sahaja Yogi.

00:13:05.682 --> 00:13:09.270
Because here one does not get any
certificate that one is a Sahaja Yogi.

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:19.385
But we should know that when we have come
to Sahaja Yoga, to what extent are we
ready to give something for it.

00:13:20.408 --> 00:13:26.671
Here I always tell the people of Bombay
that you people do not pay attention
to Bombay, you have become so ill

00:13:26.671 --> 00:13:37.440
This puja should be done very nearby (UNCLEAR),
means who will spend money to go from here to there,
"Mother, please come to our house to do the puja"

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:42.425
Then Shiv Shakti will shower on you
and when the Power of Shiv affects you

00:13:43.039 --> 00:13:47.479
then you will be surprised that,
"Oh, we do Sahaja Yoga in our homes,"

00:13:47.479 --> 00:13:50.493
"We worship the Devi then why
are we in trouble."

00:13:51.031 --> 00:13:56.221
You cannot even go to the centre,
then how will you go to Alibag from here.

00:13:56.272 --> 00:14:02.132
The people from Bombay don't move at
all. Nobody moves in Bombay.
Whatever they are stuck in,

00:14:02.132 --> 00:14:06.542
now have to go to the office, work,
earn money, this and that, wife and kids,

00:14:06.542 --> 00:14:11.739
this, that and that, all that is important
and Sahaja Yoga is not important.

00:14:11.739 --> 00:14:19.564
In the same way, for Shiva also you will become
secondary and then gradually you will become tertiary,
no one knows in which state you may go.

00:14:20.457 --> 00:14:25.907
There should be a firm grip on the Shiva tattva;
one should completely clinch on to it.

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:34.051
You must get completely engrossed into it
and with all your heart be one with it.

00:14:34.051 --> 00:14:40.382
The principle of Shiva is the most important
of all things. Only when we know/realize this,
then the worship of Shivaratri has any meaning.

00:14:40.655 --> 00:14:46.035
As they said in this, "Mother, it has
become very cold here, it has never
been this cold before,"

00:14:46.061 --> 00:14:49.641
This means that the principle of
Shiva is important.

00:14:49.641 --> 00:14:55.681
Egoists will run after this, will run
after that and many of you will get
temptations in Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:55.681 --> 00:15:01.260
Many people will get money immediately,
will get jobs, this will happen, that
will happen, they will have children,

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:08.400
even after doing all sorts of things in the world
if you give into temptation and (UNCLEAR)

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:13.781
Then the principle of Shiva will
immediately withdraw Itself
and will take away your life too.

00:15:14.787 --> 00:15:23.377
That is why today I'm telling you all (UNCLEAR)
and this is a sign/signal for you, is a warning,
that those who have come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:15:23.377 --> 00:15:32.972
should keep their life clean, be
calm in their behavior, and keep their
minds steady. This is very important.

00:15:32.972 --> 00:15:41.531
If your attention is wandering here and there,
here and there, procrastinating, then you
need to fix your attention in meditation.

00:15:41.531 --> 00:15:47.747
By being unified, by being collective, establish
the principle of Shiva within yourself, pray

00:15:47.911 --> 00:15:58.411
and the third thing is to give the highest
importance to the principle of Shiva and
get rid of the devil in you, leave the anger.

00:15:58.411 --> 00:16:02.646
It doesn't mean that a gentleman went
from here, fell in love with everything,

00:16:02.646 --> 00:16:06.444
and after going (UNCLEAR),
"Mother, I just love them."

00:16:07.543 --> 00:16:15.859
Among all this, Shiva is deeply embedded
within you, so that you get the discretion -

00:16:15.859 --> 00:16:25.606
you meditate, this has to be done,
whether this thing is right or not,
this should be done or not.

00:16:25.927 --> 00:16:31.687
If you don't know, you can ask Me.
"So I thought that this is to be done,"

00:16:31.687 --> 00:16:45.101
So, we cannot do anything about it,
because the principle of Shiva is so fierce,
so awful/dreadful, (UNCLEAR),

00:16:46.121 --> 00:16:54.105
which I'm always afraid of, that My children
have not yet grown up, have yet not improved properly,

00:16:55.454 --> 00:17:05.344
have not come on the proper path, and
if Lord Shiva's eyes open somehow,
then only (UNCLEAR - burn?) the doomsday

00:17:06.022 --> 00:17:10.942
thus it's absolutely necessary that
we become very good children.

00:17:12.936 --> 00:17:22.956
This happens especially that if Shiva is
watching, leave those alone who are bad, evil.

00:17:22.956 --> 00:17:28.056
Don't ask them (UNCLEAR) ask yourself,
correct yourself, improve yourself.

00:17:28.056 --> 00:17:33.960
Every time this question comes up that
Sahaja Yoga has done a lot for us,
what have we done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:17:36.504 --> 00:17:41.934
Every day at least one principle of the
[UNCLEAR - earth?] should be kept on Sahaj Yoga.

00:17:43.388 --> 00:17:48.848
and if nothing else could be done then
at least one principle of the
[UNCLEAR - earth?] for Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:50.197 --> 00:17:57.687
So when a person thinks in this way that,
what has he done for Sahaja Yoga,
what has he done for the collective,

00:17:57.733 --> 00:18:04.133
so Shiva will also feel that, "Yes,
the children are growing up, let
them flourish and move forward."

00:18:04.133 --> 00:18:07.638
One should be very cautious about
this principle of Shiva.

00:18:07.638 --> 00:18:12.224
Until you discover the essence(principle)
of the Spirit, you are in ignorance.

00:18:12.224 --> 00:18:19.278
Even after having the knowledge, if
you touch a snake, it will bite you.

00:18:19.278 --> 00:18:24.716
You must never have heard of a snake
biting an animal - a bull or a cow

00:18:26.123 --> 00:18:34.513
because the snake is in bondage and the
cow is also in bondage. Scorpions never bite.

00:18:35.707 --> 00:18:39.557
Horses never bite cows,
cows never bite horses.

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:45.870
What is the reason? That they are
all animals in bondage and you
are a human being today.

00:18:46.057 --> 00:18:50.897
There is so much difference, you
are Yogis(saints), from a human
being you have become a Yogi.

00:18:50.897 --> 00:18:59.342
Even after becoming a yogi, you do not
give up your ego, you do not know your
greatness, you do not know your kingship.

00:18:59.342 --> 00:19:11.547
You are seated here, there is no decorum
in you, there is no greatness in you,
how are you a Sahaja Yogi.

00:19:11.736 --> 00:19:17.926
Even now you misbehave for a few pennies,
you keep on fussing over small things.

00:19:18.466 --> 00:19:26.546
Leaving aside all these small things, leaving
aside all the petty things, there should
be expansiveness in the Shiva principle.

00:19:26.546 --> 00:19:33.873
One must attain His vastness, and in that
vastness one thinks that Shiva is the ocean.

00:19:34.161 --> 00:19:42.211
He is the ocean and we have to dissolve in
that ocean and become as vast as that ocean.

00:19:42.211 --> 00:19:49.755
Until that expansiveness comes into
our character, it will be very
wrong to call ourselves Sahaj Yogisccwc.

00:19:51.008 --> 00:20:00.102
Whenever I Myself look at it, I too
sometimes feel guilty that why
have I given love to Sahaj Yogi.

00:20:00.102 --> 00:20:04.850
When will the lotus' blossom in this mud
or will I be left sitting with the worms?

00:20:05.225 --> 00:20:10.784
Therefore every Sahaja Yogi has to
take a pledge today that, 'With
our Shiva principle

00:20:10.784 --> 00:20:18.627
we will spread that fragrance in every part
of our body so that the whole world will
say that Sahaja Yogis are people to be seen.'

00:20:18.627 --> 00:20:23.516
They steal, they cheat, they do
mischief, they boss around,

00:20:24.021 --> 00:20:29.151
and do all kinds of disgraceful things
of the world, such cannot be Yogis.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:37.130
Either they can be Namdev, Kabir or
Tukaram or any other such saints
who may have been there,

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:41.304
- Would they ever have done anything
wrong in their life? Could they ever do it?

00:20:41.982 --> 00:20:51.319
So even now whatever you people want (UNCLEAR)
give up all and stand up in complete
detachment in the Shiva principle.

00:20:51.514 --> 00:20:58.034
Just as your Mother's name is Nirmal,
I bless you all to become Nirmal.

00:20:58.034 --> 00:21:03.899
And till now you have understood
everything from Me, but this eye
of Shri Shiva which is within Me,

00:21:03.899 --> 00:21:09.280
it hits with a tremendous force,
so be careful, be cautious.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:17.806
May God give you all wisdom and with
these vibrations may you know what
is good and what is bad.

00:21:17.806 --> 00:21:22.907
“I felt, I thought, “This language
does not suit Sahaja Yogis.”

00:21:24.496 --> 00:21:28.796
Today the worship of Shiva will be
very short; It does not require much.

00:21:28.796 --> 00:21:35.656
But the fact is that Shiva, Who is
eternal and infinite, is seated
within us. After awakening Him

00:21:35.731 --> 00:21:44.121
ask Him for just one thing, there is
just request for one thing that we
should always remain engrossed in Shiva,

00:21:44.121 --> 00:21:52.817
"And we, let us just be one with You,
in Your essence, in Your company,
in Your love, in Your ideals,"

00:21:52.817 --> 00:21:59.241
"May we thrive in Your vastness/expansiveness
and remain grounded in joy."

00:21:59.241 --> 00:22:02.562
This is what you have to ask/request
from Him and this will fill you with joy.

00:22:03.004 --> 00:22:06.044
May God grant wisdom to all of you!
