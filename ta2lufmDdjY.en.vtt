00:00.060 --> 00:11.520
Now the question he asked me was, in the 
nature of an  enquiry of a person who wants  

00:11.520 --> 00:18.240
to find out, what is the proof that there is God.

00:18.240 --> 00:24.900
How are we to convince people, what is God?

00:24.900 --> 00:31.770
That we have to achieve something, 
as far as God is concerned?

00:32.490 --> 00:37.380
How are we to convince them that we 
have got all these centers within  

00:37.380 --> 00:43.710
us and that you have to achieve that realization?

00:43.710 --> 00:48.480
And also how are we to prove to others 
that you have achieved your realization?

00:48.480 --> 01:00.180
This is the question which everyone 
who is not yet a fully Sahaja Yogi  

01:00.180 --> 01:05.700
would feel and ask you questions 
and you should have answers to it.

01:05.700 --> 01:14.070
The first and foremost question is 
how do we prove that there is God?

01:14.070 --> 01:22.050
Because you assumed that there is God 
because somebody has said, “There is God."

01:22.050 --> 01:29.100
Now what are the ways of 
proving this that there is God?

01:29.100 --> 01:35.280
So we have to attack the question,  

01:35.280 --> 01:43.800
first from the reasoning point of view 
that we should be able to tell people  

01:43.800 --> 01:51.690
that there is God through reason not through 
experiencing because they are to be prepared for it.

01:51.690 --> 02:01.050
There will be many who really do not believe 
in God but just out of fashion they’re saying,  

02:01.050 --> 02:05.340
“All right we accept” because they want 
to keep up peace and the compromise.

02:08.160 --> 02:15.150
But how you start about 
convincing them rationally?

02:15.150 --> 02:20.460
Perhaps I spoke in one of My lectures if you 
have that, I don’t know if you have got it.

02:20.460 --> 02:26.130
But we can prove it – the existence of God.

02:26.130 --> 02:34.485
You may call it God or nature or 
whatever it is, from many point of view.

02:34.485 --> 02:40.560
For example in short we can say, “There are 
many scientific things we cannot explain”.

02:40.560 --> 02:52.560
We cannot explain how the periodic laws were 
established without somebody being there.

02:52.560 --> 03:04.410
Periodic laws of chemical substances 
or the elements that exist on this  

03:04.410 --> 03:09.960
Earth is so regular and so properly 
plotted down that you can see there  

03:09.960 --> 03:12.150
must be some plotter otherwise it cannot be done.

03:12.150 --> 03:16.650
I mean if you want to avoid it, you 
can avoid it but there must be someone.

03:16.650 --> 03:20.580
Say we come in this room and find 
everything properly organized,  

03:20.580 --> 03:22.620
lit up and we should know there 
must be somebody who has done it.

03:27.330 --> 03:35.160
Then a very good example is given 
by a very good French biologist,  

03:35.160 --> 03:48.210
he says that if you use law of chance, the 
law of chance states that – if you have got  

03:48.210 --> 03:58.020
fifty red pebbles and fifty white pebbles put 
in a jar and if you shake that jar it goes into  

03:58.020 --> 04:07.740
a chaotic condition and the distribution 
of these pebbles is in a chaotic way.

04:07.740 --> 04:17.640
To bring them back to their normal condition of 
having the red on one side and the white on the  

04:17.640 --> 04:26.460
other side, you go on shaking it as many times 
as you like and they have found out – there’s  

04:26.460 --> 04:32.820
minimum of minimum so many times it has to 
be done otherwise it cannot be worked out.

04:32.820 --> 04:37.200
This is all done by chance.

04:37.200 --> 04:40.290
You see by chance when it has 
to come to normal condition.

04:40.290 --> 04:44.790
How many chances you have to take?

04:44.790 --> 04:47.580
There’s a certain amount of a formula.

04:47.580 --> 04:50.490
Something raised to power ‘n’, call it ‘n’.

04:50.490 --> 05:06.660
So as a biologist he tried to calculate that if 
matter has to become living, then to get to that  

05:06.660 --> 05:21.900
density how many years are required by the law of 
chance to bring forth a living cell – one cell?

05:21.900 --> 05:28.110
And he found out that billions and 
billions and billions of years,  

05:28.110 --> 05:39.150
if this law of chance works out then only 
one unicellular animal can be created.

05:40.960 --> 05:51.190
But in this short time from when the Earth 
receded from the Sun and then cooled down  

05:51.190 --> 05:59.650
and then life came into being, then human 
beings were created who are very complicated.  

05:59.650 --> 06:05.530
It is such a short time, compared to 
that time which is required by chance,

06:05.530 --> 06:10.750
that he has proved mathematically that 
it is an impossibility, it cannot happen.

06:10.750 --> 06:14.530
It is that fantastic.

06:14.530 --> 06:20.680
This is a scientific very good proof 
of a biologist that there is somebody,  

06:20.680 --> 06:22.270
a juggler, who is doing that job.

06:22.270 --> 06:27.040
You may call Him ‘God’; you may call Him 
‘Nature’ whatever is, but the nature thinks.

06:27.040 --> 06:34.630
People like Yung have proved the 
existence of collective consciousness.

06:34.630 --> 06:46.480
The existence of unconscious, which gives us 
dreams through which we get universal symbols.

06:46.480 --> 06:52.570
All over the world whether we are 
in India or in England or anywhere.

06:52.570 --> 06:59.230
The symbols are the same and he has done 
experiments with thousands of people.

06:59.230 --> 07:05.020
On the medical science also one 
can say as you know that one of  

07:05.020 --> 07:14.110
the arguments we put in for is that 
acetylene and adrenaline which are  

07:14.110 --> 07:19.780
two chemicals when they are in the body 
– human body, they act very arbitrarily.

07:19.780 --> 07:25.240
Means they have to augment – 
mean to contract or to relax.

07:25.240 --> 07:29.320
Those who relax must relax; those 
who have to contract must contract.

07:29.320 --> 07:32.350
But those who are supposed 
to be contracting relax,  

07:32.350 --> 07:36.790
while those who are supposed 
to be relaxing contract.

07:36.790 --> 07:41.560
So they have not been able to explain and 
they have written, all of the doctors,  

07:41.560 --> 07:47.740
they say that the mode of conduct of these 
chemicals in the body one cannot say.

07:47.740 --> 07:58.510
Another thing is that one of the very very 
important arguments that people have given  

07:58.510 --> 08:04.930
is this that supposing a foreign 
body goes inside the human body,  

08:04.930 --> 08:09.850
there’s always a tendency to 
throw it out as soon as possible.

08:09.850 --> 08:12.250
Supposing something goes into 
your throat, you cough out.

08:12.250 --> 08:15.460
Supposing something goes in the 
blood, they will try to throw it away.

08:15.460 --> 08:17.290
That’s the system it is.

08:17.290 --> 08:25.750
But when the fetus is formed in the 
body, then not only it is kept there,  

08:25.750 --> 08:29.500
it is nurtured, looked after and 
thrown out at the right time.

08:29.500 --> 08:34.450
How can you explain that?

08:34.450 --> 08:37.330
There are thousand and one explanations people  

08:37.330 --> 08:39.610
have tried to give but none 
of them are satisfactory.

08:39.610 --> 08:46.330
Then this Earth is spinning with such a 
speed and we are kept glued to this Earth,  

08:46.330 --> 08:47.680
we never even feel the speed.

08:47.680 --> 08:55.510
And so many things like that people have been 
able to say and the so many scientists have  

08:55.510 --> 09:03.550
felt that, there is some force which 
is beyond us which is very dynamic,  

09:03.550 --> 09:06.580
which acts in such dynamic 
ways that we cannot explain.

09:06.580 --> 09:14.290
So we come to a point where we tell people that 
there is some force which we have to discover.

09:14.290 --> 09:22.030
Now then as Sahaja Yogis you can 
say that this hankering to seek.

09:22.030 --> 09:26.470
After a certain level of evolution  

09:26.470 --> 09:29.830
because some people do not have 
at all seeking, you know that.

09:29.830 --> 09:33.280
They are just seeking food 
– to eat just like animals.

09:33.280 --> 09:35.290
Some people are seeking power.

09:35.290 --> 09:39.430
Some people are seeking money also.

09:39.430 --> 09:45.010
But there are so many people who 
are seeking something beyond.

09:45.010 --> 09:52.690
This seeking has come to us and this seeking that  

09:52.690 --> 09:59.890
has come to us has led us to some sort 
of a path by which we should find out.

09:59.890 --> 10:05.830
Now you have seen with your naked 
eyes, a Kundalini rising at My Feet.

10:05.830 --> 10:11.410
You have seen the pulsation of the 
Kundalini taking place. That nobody can do.

10:11.410 --> 10:13.570
There is no mesmerism, nothing.

10:13.570 --> 10:22.090
When the Kundalini rises, with the stethoscope 
you can feel the rising of the Kundalini.

10:22.090 --> 10:28.810
With the rising of Kundalini you have known 
that we have cured people of different diseases.

10:28.810 --> 10:30.430
Even a person who was just dying,  

10:30.430 --> 10:37.510
whom doctor had decided that they are dead 
and to be buried very soon, have been cured.

10:37.510 --> 10:44.020
And it is so dynamic, the dynamism I’ll tell you.

10:44.020 --> 10:48.580
It’s so dynamic – like we 
can take the case of Eddy’s

10:48.580 --> 10:48.850
brother.

10:48.850 --> 10:53.770
That he was so very sick and they said,  

10:54.520 --> 10:57.220
“He has got blood cancer, he’s 
going to die within eight days”.

10:57.220 --> 11:02.050
I mean he just told Me this, 
that’s all and he’s cured.

11:02.050 --> 11:06.805
Then Linda told Me that her mother 
was always angry with Peter.

11:06.805 --> 11:10.810
[Mother speaks aside – “Where is she gone?

11:10.810 --> 11:15.850
Where is she?

11:15.850 --> 11:29.260
Linda!”] – So she told Me that the 
mother would never talk to Peter,  

11:29.260 --> 11:31.960
she was very angry with him always, 
she would never talk to him.

11:31.960 --> 11:39.130
But she told Me all these things and suddenly she  

11:39.130 --> 11:42.880
found that now she’s become very good 
and congenial and nice and talking.

11:42.880 --> 11:50.230
You have seen such transformations 
coming among many, many, many people.

11:50.230 --> 11:55.450
How people are changing, transforming, this 
is absolutely dynamic; you cannot do it.

11:55.450 --> 12:03.820
So many sick people are suddenly 
cured only through attention you know.

12:03.820 --> 12:23.200
There must be something about it and that is 
how you have to convince people about Sahaja.

12:23.200 --> 12:30.730
But after getting realization you just see the 
Kundalini, you see the rising of the Kundalini.

12:30.730 --> 12:35.110
You also feel the vibrating force of Kundalini.

12:35.110 --> 12:40.990
You also see how you got cured, 
how you got out of your problems.

12:40.990 --> 12:46.300
How you were in trouble?

12:46.300 --> 12:49.210
What problems you had?

12:49.210 --> 12:57.940
You had seen all these things and 
these things happen to you also.

12:57.940 --> 13:05.500
Some of you were drug addicts, some of you 
were suffering from some mental troubles.

13:05.500 --> 13:07.390
Some were having physical problems.

13:07.390 --> 13:13.090
All these, you see, are cured and 
you are much better people now.

13:13.090 --> 13:21.610
This has happened to you very easily 
without much effort being put into.

13:21.610 --> 13:25.720
It is not possible to get 
rid of these things easily.

13:25.720 --> 13:31.690
Definitely you can raise the 
Kundalini, you can feel the Kundalini.

13:31.690 --> 13:39.070
You can, you know for definite that 
when you say that person has got this  

13:39.070 --> 13:43.270
left Swadishthana or anything everybody 
says the same and you are sure of it.

13:43.270 --> 13:48.850
It is not possible for everyone 
to say the same thing, even the  

13:48.850 --> 13:52.690
children saying the same thing about a 
person and he says also it is verified.

13:52.690 --> 14:04.660
So part of it comes to you in complete 
proof that there is something about it.

14:04.660 --> 14:16.870
Second part also comes to 
you as a proof because now  

14:16.870 --> 14:18.700
you know there are vibrations flowing into you.

14:18.700 --> 14:20.170
There’s no jugglery about it.

14:20.170 --> 14:26.410
And then you can feel it very clearly.

14:26.410 --> 14:31.570
You have raised the Kundalini of many people.

14:31.570 --> 14:35.920
You have given them realization; even 
the photograph has given realization.

14:35.920 --> 14:40.225
You know for definite it is so.

14:40.225 --> 14:47.020
And also you know that if you want 
to ask any fundamental questions,  

14:47.020 --> 14:52.120
you get answer as a great flow of vibrations.

14:52.120 --> 14:56.110
So when you ask the question 
[Mother speaks aside].

14:56.110 --> 15:03.550
When you ask the question, 
“Whether there is God?”,  

15:03.550 --> 15:10.060
Immediately you get tremendous 
vibrations proving that there is.

15:10.060 --> 15:18.460
You ask the some questions, which 
you know for definite and say,  

15:18.460 --> 15:28.990
“Is it so?” And you know that it is not so, 
definitely you do not get any vibrations.

15:28.990 --> 15:35.620
That’s how relatively you know when do you 
get vibrations when you don’t get vibrations.

15:35.620 --> 15:41.140
If you ask a very big fundamental question, 
you get vibrations of a very strong nature.

15:41.140 --> 15:43.570
But in ordinary things you might get a little.

15:43.570 --> 15:47.980
So it proves that the vibrations 
speak to you as vibrations.

15:50.510 --> 15:58.370
This should prove that there is God 
because you have asked on vibrations  

15:58.370 --> 16:04.730
and you have found that there are 
vibrations and that there is God.

16:04.730 --> 16:15.140
Now what happened in the case of Buddha 
that He got realization as you got it and  

16:15.140 --> 16:18.650
He had no way of finding out 
whether there is God or not.

16:18.650 --> 16:20.420
So He said, “There is no 
God, only there is ‘self'”.

16:20.420 --> 16:24.410
But you have gone beyond it.

16:24.410 --> 16:34.970
So if you find seventy percent 
of the proof through your own  

16:34.970 --> 16:38.060
experiencing it and raising 
of the Kundalini and all that.

16:38.060 --> 16:43.820
Then the thirty percent, whatever it is, is 
to be ascertained through the vibrations.

16:43.820 --> 16:48.530
And when you ascertain it through the 
vibrations – for example I say, “This is hot”.

16:48.530 --> 16:50.030
How do I know?

16:50.030 --> 16:52.310
By feeling it itself, it is hot.

16:52.310 --> 16:56.450
Now anything that makes Me hot is hot.

16:56.450 --> 16:59.870
But relatively I know this is 
hot, that is hot, that is cold.

16:59.870 --> 17:07.850
In the same way on vibrations also you can ask 
various questions and find out ‘yes’ and ‘no’  

17:07.850 --> 17:18.380
and then you can believe it – that there is God 
Almighty and this all pervading power exists,  

17:18.380 --> 17:22.670
not only exists but operates, 
the rest of it is all a myth.

17:22.670 --> 17:32.240
But when you rise in Sahaja Yoga being Sahaja,  

17:32.240 --> 17:38.810
you take it for granted, as we 
take everything for granted.

17:38.810 --> 17:47.720
All the trees growing, the mango tree giving 
a mango, guava tree only gives guavas.

17:47.720 --> 17:55.550
We never try to find out how in one little seed 
so much is built in, so much is programmed.

17:55.550 --> 18:01.430
We take it for granted all these 
great miracles of the world.

18:01.430 --> 18:05.510
In the same way we take this 
miracle also for granted.

18:05.510 --> 18:08.120
This is what ‘maya’ is.

18:08.120 --> 18:13.070
That is makes everything 
look so simple and straight.

18:13.070 --> 18:15.860
And you just start taking it for granted.

18:15.860 --> 18:30.860
Then you have to understand that it is 
not to be taken for granted but is to  

18:30.860 --> 18:38.270
be very much respected, worshipped and accepted.

18:38.270 --> 18:49.940
The amount of preparation you have, 
the amount of strength you have,  

18:49.940 --> 18:54.170
that is the amount of truth you are going to get.

18:54.170 --> 19:01.160
Truth also weighs you very clearly 
whether you can receive it or not.

19:01.160 --> 19:09.320
There is no diplomacy that can work this out.

19:09.320 --> 19:10.670
No cheating, nothing.

19:10.670 --> 19:12.890
Truth knows how far you are.

19:12.890 --> 19:23.420
The more you become stronger, the more the truth 
manifest through you and you receive the truth.

19:23.420 --> 19:31.250
Just now some of you are still 
little babies of three months  

19:31.250 --> 19:32.600
and four months and something like that.

19:32.600 --> 19:44.630
And still sometimes taken for granted you do 
things which you should not do and harm yourself.

19:44.630 --> 19:49.670
Its only question of harming yourself 
not harming Me or harming Sahaja Yoga,  

19:49.670 --> 19:52.310
which cannot be harmed, but you harm yourself.

19:52.310 --> 19:57.350
So one has to be very careful 
one should understand the laws  

19:57.350 --> 20:09.410
and regulations as Gavin had read the 
last time, the statutes of God’s laws.

20:11.430 --> 20:16.260
You must understand how it works.

20:16.260 --> 20:21.270
You cannot take law into your 
hands by taking it for granted.

20:21.270 --> 20:27.780
Law operates and it knows everything.

20:27.780 --> 20:31.110
It is the law of love.

20:31.110 --> 20:35.640
That’s why it allows you to 
make little mistakes to learn.

20:35.640 --> 20:42.960
But it will not protect you when you start 
saying that, 'all right I want to do it on my own'.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.970
“All right”, it says, “All right go ahead”.

20:44.970 --> 20:54.810
So one has to know that this 
law operates not blindly,  

20:54.810 --> 21:03.150
lovingly and it tries to teach you also sometimes 
that don’t do this wrong and don’t do that wrong.

21:03.150 --> 21:13.230
But when it comes to real punishment, the 
punishment is that this law leaves you alone.

21:13.230 --> 21:23.520
It just lets you go; the attention recedes, 
that is the worst thing that can happen to anyone.

21:23.520 --> 21:28.470
That you are not in the attention 
of God is the worst thing.

21:28.470 --> 21:35.130
So even if you make mistakes doesn’t matter.

21:35.130 --> 21:43.890
Pray for the attention of God always because 
the attention of God is the law – 'law of love'.

21:43.890 --> 21:50.610
You cannot cheat it. Everything is known.

21:50.610 --> 21:58.530
Every word you say is known, 
every word you don’t say is known,  

21:58.530 --> 22:02.250
every thought that comes in you is known.

22:02.250 --> 22:12.330
So purify yourself with love, understanding.

22:12.330 --> 22:17.970
Try to purify and tell yourself that, “I 
have to purify myself as much as possible”.

22:17.970 --> 22:21.420
With purification only, you 
will have the proper strength.

22:21.420 --> 22:27.540
If you have not purified, then there won’t 
be any strength for you to bear the truth.

22:27.540 --> 22:36.960
Once you bear the truth, your own life 
will convince people that you are Divine.

22:36.960 --> 22:40.380
Your face will convince people.

22:40.380 --> 22:45.750
Everything that you do will convince people 
that you are Divine and whatever you say,  

22:45.750 --> 22:49.050
people will know it is 
coming through Divine Force.
