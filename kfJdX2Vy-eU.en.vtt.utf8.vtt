00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.040
According to the calendar,

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.800
this year there are ten days of Navaratri,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.000
not of nine.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.040
Nine are the days,

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.760
in the night,

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.040
when the Goddess had to fight the demons

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:12.280
and to save Her children from the effects of negativity.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.520
On one side,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.200
She was ocean of love and compassion,

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.240
and on the other side,

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.400
She was protecting them like a tigress.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.800
Because the times

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.240
were such that nobody could meditate,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.360
nobody could take the name of God,

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.920
nobody could think even of self-realization.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.360
But those who are sitting here today,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.560
you have been there also in those days,

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:05.080
and you were all saved for today, for this day,

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.600
so that you can achieve your Self Realization.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.320
The form of the Goddess in those days

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.840
was not Maya Swarupi.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.680
She was in Her real form,

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.040
and that created a great awe,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.480
even among the disciples.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.320
So the question of giving them

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.080
Self Realization was not there.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.160
First of all, they were to be saved.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.640
So like nine months the mother has to keep the child

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.200
in her womb, for these nine months,

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.080
or you can say nine yugas, nine times,

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.480
you all have been saved properly,

00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:01.600
and on the tenth month you are given your birth.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.600
Also this birth is always after seven days of nine months.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.880
So we had to wait

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.840
for some time till it matures.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.120
Now the tenth Navaratri today

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.320
is to celebrate actually the Adi Shakti.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.360
So today we are really going to worship the Adi Shakti.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.680
On one side the Adi Shakti is Mahakali,

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.600
on the other side, She is Mahasaraswati,

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.280
in the center She is Mahalakshmi,

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.640
and also She is the Amba,

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.880
the One Who is the Kundalini.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.240
But She is also beyond that.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.080
She's parashakti;

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.200
She's beyond all the powers.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.520
Because She is the generator of power.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.600
So, She has to be beyond all that.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.400
So today when we are worshipping Her,

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.560
we have to worship Her in all these forms.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.080
So you understand that the tenth day

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.400
that we are having Navaratri for the first time

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.040
in the calendar is because

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.960
today is the day when we are worshipping Adi Shakti.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.040
Adi Shakti was never worshipped before, never.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.160
But, this time, when I went to Calcutta,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.080
I told them that "You better worship Adi Shakti today."

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.160
And they were surprised,

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.440
"Why today Mother is asking

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.240
for Adi Shakti to be worshipped?"

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.520
So when I went back to Poona,

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.600
they told Me that Adi Shakti, as you know,

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.720
is the Saptashringi,

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.480
means the One with seven peaks.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.480
She rests on the seven peaks,

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.440
means on the Sahasrara, on the seven, seven chakras.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.440
She rules all the seven chakras.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.600
They told me that when we had the puja in Calcutta,

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.000
same time, that's the only time

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.080
when those who follow Saptashringi,

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.240
which are very few people, all of them come there,

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.920
and there they come, first of all

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.120
the people from Her mother's side come down.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.080
So the mother's side of the Adi Shakti

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.200
are regarded as Vaishnavites, the one who follow Vishnu.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.080
So they come first there to worship Her,

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.320
and then the father-in-law's side,

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.360
that is Shiva's side, comes in, Sadashiva's side.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.480
That's exactly that time when we had the puja.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.200
They have these two groups together to worship.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.160
So now we have among ourselves people of two types.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.160
One are, we can call the one who worship Brahmadeva

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.080
on the right hand side,

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.520
and the people who worship Shiva on the left hand side.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.120
Both sides have to meet at a point,

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.240
and that point has come,

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.280
that we have to worship

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.480
the complete integrated form of all these powers,

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.320
which has manifested within us.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.640
Now when they say there is only one God,

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.520
all right there is one God.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.800
But one God has got a head,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.120
He's got His liver,

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.240
He's got His stomach,

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.880
He's got His nose.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.520
He's got everything.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.480
Just like as human beings are.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.120
Because they say so,

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.080
that God made human beings in their own image.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.760
So then He has different parts in the bodies,

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.440
and He has to run those different parts.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.360
And for these different parts,

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.200
He has to have Deities,

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.480
and these Deities are to be understood.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.200
And unless und until you understand

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.920
and worship those Deities,

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.560
you cannot awaken those Deities within yourself.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.880
But they all are part and parcel of the Adi Shakti.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.400
Are completely under the control of the Adi Shakti.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.880
Yesterday you heard about the powers of the Adi Shakti.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.040
It's like

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:45.960
a tortoise takes his whole body inside his shell,

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.880
in the same way

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.040
I have withdrawn all these powers within Myself.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.080
I mean, you cannot discover them easily.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.480
You cannot find them out easily.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.160
Except for these modern cameras,

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.560
which are trying to cheat us.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:11.800
They are the ones who are giving My forms and things to you.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.600
Because there is light

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.840
in these vibrations,

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.800
and when these vibrations are emitted,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.920
you start seeing them in these cameras,

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.440
even if they may not be very sensitive,

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.560
but somehow people catch it.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.160
There have been so many miraculous photographs, as you know.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.880
One photograph you must have seen

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.200
where Shri Ganesha Himself is standing behind Me.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.560
Now you don't see anyone standing just now here.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.480
But you don't know what's happening.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.840
And this is what one has to understand,

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:06.200
That we have entered into a new realm of God's magic.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.400
And His magic works, in so many ways.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:18.120
Of course, sometimes, you also get lost.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:26.120
Because of your previous problems you get dragged down.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:30.920
You get tempted.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:36.360
Sometimes you get also dominated

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:41.520
by negative forces and you fall down.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.080
And this is a very sad thing

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.320
that should happen to any Sahaja Yogi.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.080
Because perhaps you do not know your past,

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.200
and you do not know how you have struggled,

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:03.160
how you have worked hard to come up to this level.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.840
And after coming to this level,

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.400
if you do not try to go higher,

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.560
then

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:18.480
either you'll be stuck on the same place,

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.760
or maybe that you may be thrown down.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:28.800
So for you to know that you are a Sahaja Yogi,

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:34.520
you are not a wife, husband, mother, father,

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.840
you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.960
Like I'm the Adi Shakti,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.440
like that you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:46.000
So "My main job now is to give realization to others.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:51.120
And because all My relationships are already fixed properly,

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:56.080
I don't have to worry about any Deity, about any God,

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:00.160
They all work out very efficiently, everything."

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:04.720
Now the description yesterday as you read of the Goddess,

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.360
that Her hands were throwing

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.080
all the arrows with such a speed that

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.160
as if one felt that She was dancing.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.600
Is a fact, no doubt,

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.880
but you don't see that.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:25.080
You cannot see that every hair of Mine is like an arrow.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.240
And it works so tremendously.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.640
But to you I'm just sitting here quietly,

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.520
just like you as you are sitting.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.000
But it's not so.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.200
It's something much more.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:48.120
Now when they show a lion or a tiger,

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.800
as My vahana,

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.320
then you have to understand that they show,

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.120
actually they are.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.960
Actually they are.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.040
It's not that they are symbolically, actually they are.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.160
So the dignity of a tiger,

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.040
I have told you many a times how dignified it is.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:11.360
Because I sit on him, he's so dignified.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.600
If he has to eat the meat, he'll kill one cow or anything,

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.400
eat the meat, leave it for others.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.800
It's so dignified.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.640
And once a month he eats.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:30.480
So even to get a vahana of this kind,

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.640
this was to be evolved from amoeba stage to this stage.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.680
Otherwise he would not have been here.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.360
In the same way you are evolved,

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:47.520
and in you are these, all these vahanas also there.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.480
And they work out

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.560
very quickly all that you want.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.360
You desire something;

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.160
you'll be surprised immediately you'll find it works out.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.320
You ask for something, immediately it works out.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:13.080
But there should be a complete dedication in Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.040
When I say Sahaj Yog,

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:21.520
you know that is the yoga of your attention with My Feet.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.880
That's what it is.

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.520
But if you are still moving with your egos

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.160
and if you are still thinking on those lines

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:41.320
that "We are something and we can start our own Sahaj Yog,

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.560
we can work out this way and that way,"

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.320
or "My wife is like that, my child is like that,

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.360
my husband is like that."

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:52.400
You have to give up all these problems on one side.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:57.240
Otherwise, you will not ascend.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.320
It was not difficult for Me to give you Realization,

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.720
because you were just ready for that.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:08.000
But to keep your light on, you have to work hard.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.000
Now tiger remains at its own position.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.800
He doesn't change.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.600
Lion remains at his own position,

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.080
and they are all available, all the time,

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.760
in their own position.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.920
All the Devatas and Gods are in Their own positions

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.280
with Their own qualities, They are there.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.400
Nowhere, none of these Gods have described that

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.440
They give you moksha. Except for the Goddess.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:39.280
She's the only One who gives you Realization.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.600
Because She's in charge of all the seven chakras.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.320
She holds all these seven chakras,

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:50.400
and on these seven chakras She can work it out.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.560
So there's a big history,

00:15:54.760 --> 00:16:01.800
evolution of all those things even in the Virata's body,

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.560
and also in you people.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.560
So you have to cope with it.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.800
If you cannot cope with it,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.480
then it won't work out.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.960
Now the problems we have, in the West, as you know,

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.880
are stupid problems

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:24.080
which are not suitable to any Sahaja Yogi.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.560
Attachment.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.960
First they were not attached to their wives

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.200
or to their children, now they're attached like glue.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:44.040
I do not say you give up your children or your wife,

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:48.280
but your attachment should be with Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.720
Once the blessings of Sahaja Yoga comes to you,

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.160
they will flow to your children,

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.760
to your wife, to everyone, to your country,

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.000
to the whole world.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.720
Now supposing this is the attachment,

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.280
a very simple electrical thing.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.360
So if its attachment is not to the mains,

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.240
and anywhere else, what's the use?

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.560
It cannot give electricity to anybody else.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.240
Is a simple logic,

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:24.280
that you should be attached to the source of energy first.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.520
Simple logic.

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:31.040
And then, that energy can flow to others.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.520
If you yourself you are not attached

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.400
to that source of energy,

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:41.560
how can that power flow anywhere?

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.160
It's a simple thing we do not understand in Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.120
And so our attachments

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:57.920
start getting rusted and we don't understand

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.160
what has happened to us.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.960
You are not attached to the main source!

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.440
And that's the only attachment you need.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:16.240
And then the whole thing will flow to the other end.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.240
So, we have these kinds of attachments.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:28.520
Then we are attached to so many miserable things we like,

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.120
which make us miserable.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:43.120
For example, we are attached, to say,

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:49.240
some sort of a stupid entrepreneur fashion.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.440
We're attached to it.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.920
Whether it is in Sahaj culture or not,

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.920
we are attached to it.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:08.120
And all these attachments are not to the source,

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:09.960
to the source of joy,

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.520
to the source of knowledge,

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.800
to the source of energy which ascends you.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.680
This is the reason why

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.640
our situation

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:32.240
of collective ascent is poor.

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:44.560
Now the Adi Shakti's work is to give you Realization first,

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:51.600
second is to give you life,

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.360
to comfort you.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.120
If you have physical problems,

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.040
She will look after you.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.240
She'll go all out.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.440
If you've mental problem,

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.560
She will try to solve.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.160
So, She's a comforter;

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.840
She gives you the comfort.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.280
At the same time, She protects you.

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.600
I've seen many people, even now,

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.000
get frightened very soon,

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.200
at the slightest thing.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.240
Why should you be frightened?

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.760
There's a tiger standing.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:32.960
You can't see him, may be today he might be in the picture.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.080
And your Mother is so powerful.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.880
You have to understand how powerful She is.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.360
This is, the understanding is not in your heads.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.120
Sometimes your wives are more powerful

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.920
or your children are more powerful.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.000
When you know that your Mother is so powerful

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.200
- She's your Mother.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:01.520
Then you should be absolutely secured.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.880
And then things work out.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.520
I'll give you an example of one gentleman

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.960
whom I met in Madras

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.720
once, not many years back,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.520
about I think two, three years back or so.

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:23.600
He was such a seeker, immediately he recognized Me.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.640
And then he went down to Bombay, posting was there,

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.240
and he received a letter saying that his mother

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.240
on death bed. So he went down.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.440
The doctor said that "She has a galloping cancer

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.480
and she's going to die in no time."

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.920
He knows, "My Mother is Adi Shakti."

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.880
Just took My photograph, sat before Me,

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.800
said, "Mother, I've nothing to say,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.760
whatever You think proper for my mother, please do that."

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.960
Just he said so. He's connected.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.320
They said three days after, "She's going to die."

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.360
Three days after she got out of the hospital.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:00.560
He took him down to Bombay, showed him in a hospital,

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.720
in cancer hospital.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.920
They said, "She has no cancer, nothing,

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.320
she's completely cured."

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:15.480
If the energy is not allowed to flow,

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.080
you are still worried about your wife,

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.240
you're worried about your house,

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.160
you're worried about your children,

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.440
you're worried about this,

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.280
about "my children, my house, my wife"

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:30.600
this "my" when it drops,

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.400
then I can work.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.120
But it should not be taken

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.360
that I'm saying you become ascetics, no way.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.600
No saints were ascetics,

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.760
they all had wives, they all had children.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:51.400
But all their attention was at the Lotus Feet of the Mother.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.440
As Guru Nanaka has said

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.440
that a little boy is playing with his kite,

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.520
the kite is going all over,

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.800
and he is talking to his friends, joking, this thing,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.960
but his attention is on the kite.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.280
There's a lady who is cleaning her house

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.600
with a little child on her waist,

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:20.320
and she's cleaning the house and grooming it.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.440
She's doing everything, but her attention is on her child.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.160
Then there are ladies in India, as you know,

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.160
they have three, four pitchers filled water

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.160
and they walk with both the hands like this.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.960
They know how to balance it.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.960
They're talking to each other, laughing, making fun,

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:43.200
pulling legs. But the attention is on the pitchers.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.000
My attention is always on your Kundalini.

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:56.920
You cannot play tricks in Sahaja Yog, take it from Me.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.120
Anybody who tries to play any trick

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.720
will be very badly punished.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.960
So please be very, very careful not to be dishonest,

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.480
and not to play tricks in Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.760
I won't do anything, but here they are!

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:18.520
You see already, with all his teeth.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.320
They're all fixed quantities, I have told them.

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.800
They're are fixed quantities.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.680
They know what to do, and they will do it.

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.560
So there is no need to play any tricks in Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:41.000
This is another mistake of Sahaja Yogis,

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.200
that they think they can play tricks with Me

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.560
or with Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.920
When those things come into your head,

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:54.080
I would say these are demonic ideas,

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:57.360
because they will destroy you completely.

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.080
On one side Sahaja Yoga is a blessing,

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:06.360
absolutely blessing on the ascent you go ahead like that.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.480
You go to a height,

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.200
but you must know also, you've reached the height;

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.560
you have to be very careful to be there.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.080
Because once you fall from that height,

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.440
how deep you'll go?

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:24.360
Is logical again to see that you'll fall very low.

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:31.080
So here you are having the blessings,

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:36.040
all the beauties, all the love, all the joy,

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:43.000
all the knowledge, all the friends, all the care.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:49.760
And there, if you don't want to be here,

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.600
just because you are playing tricks,

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.800
you want to be here and play tricks, that is not possible.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000
That doesn't work out,

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.800
you are immediately thrown out,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.480
and once you are thrown out, God knows where you'll go.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.760
That's not our lookout.

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.320
But you are thrown out by these.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:18.320
So one has to know that the Deities are extremely alert.

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:27.320
And They're watching all of you.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.200
Because They have to guard you,

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.240
They have to look after you,

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.360
They have to help you,

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.240
They have to do everything for you.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.480
They have to work out everything for you.

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.280
They are the Ones who create flowers for you;

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.440
They're doing all kinds of good things for you.

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.480
But, at the same time,

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.920
They are only attached to Me,

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.960
all of Them,

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.800
not to you.

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.600
Because you are My children,

00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.600
They are looking after you.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.680
Once you try to misbehave,

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:07.600
you are finished and you go down.

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:15.440
But the compassion of your Mother is so great,

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.920
that She always tries to forgive,

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:26.080
give chances and tells those Deities to keep quiet.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:30.240
Of course They obey - up to a point.

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:35.280
But if you want to be nasty people,

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.240
if you want to be cruel,

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:42.200
if you want to be sinful

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:45.240
and stay in Sahaja Yoga, you cannot.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.240
It's not like any religion as you saw yesterday

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.360
that you commit any mistakes,

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:54.760
do what you like, kill anyone, cheat anyone,

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.240
and still be there.

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:57.920
It's not like that.

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:07.440
Here you have to be Sahaja Yogi

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:10.560
in the real sense of the word.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:15.760
And this is why one has to understand.

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.240
There are some Sahaja Yogis have come, they can't get in,

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.560
I think the doors are closed.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:35.960
So, now such a tremendous Power,

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:39.200
so alert, so affectionate,

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.880
so kind

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.680
is there.

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:54.160
And a Mother, Who is your teacher.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:59.400
Mother teaches children with love.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.720
Not only that,

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:03.960
but you never even felt how I taught you Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.360
You just learnt it like that.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.680
It's a child's play for you.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.520
It's such a difficult and subtle subject;

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.520
you picked it up without any difficulties.

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.400
So artfully it was done,

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.240
beautifully it was done,

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.400
built in within you, now you know this is Sahaja Yog,

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.640
this is not Sahaj Yoga.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:29.400
All this knowledge came to you so sweetly.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.040
The way you sing Indian musics, you see,

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.200
even the Indians are surprised,

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.200
they can't sing like you sometimes.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.720
Those who had come to My program, they saw you.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.080
Some musicians, they said,

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.680
"We were really ashamed.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:45.320
How could these people sing so well?

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:50.560
And pronounce everything so well?"

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:58.520
And you have to trust this Power fully!

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:03.400
Those days, when people were in difficulties,

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.480
they were always attacked,

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.600
they had not got their Self Realization,

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:12.520
they had to put their trust into the Divine Power.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.920
They had to put.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.240
But now when you have got Realization,

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.360
you have got your freedom.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.200
Should never forget that you have to trust

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.520
this Divine Power.

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:34.600
All the time that It will look after you.

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:40.320
Now, how do we play tricks in Sahaja Yoga?

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.200
Some lazy lumps come into Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.920
Absolute lazy lumps, means they must be left-sided

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.440
or whatever it is.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.360
And if you tell them,
"You better do this work."

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.440
"No Mother, I won't do this work,

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.680
because my right side will come up."

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.880
Very common trick.

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.520
Is a very common trick,

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.520
"I can't do this work!"

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.920
When it comes to work, they'll just run away.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.720
How many people work?

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.320
Very few.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.360
The other day I went to the kitchen,

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:21.520
and I asked this Indian girls what's happening,

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.720
they said, "They are all running away.

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.360
Nobody's here to help us."

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.400
Nobody wants to take responsibility.

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:35.120
But the trick is that it is played on Sahaja Yoga,

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:39.320
that "If I do this thing I will become right-sided."

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:42.040
But if you become left-sided,

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.280
this one is there.

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:50.560
Is very nice you have put him here, I am very happy.

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:59.320
So, all lethargic people, lazy lumps,

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.160
always do that.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.400
Now, somebody is told that

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:06.560
"You have to get up in the morning."

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.200
They feel terrible about it,

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.000
"Oh! How to get up?"

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.120
But if you go back into your own background,

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.120
you'll say you must have taken drugs,

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.120
you must have taken alcohols,

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:19.040
you must have taken all these left-sided things,

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.600
that's why you cannot get up in the morning!

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.800
Now, how will you

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:30.960
finish or neutralize those bad habits that you had?

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.240
How will you do it?

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.920
If you start getting up early in the morning,

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:41.240
slowly the habit will be formed,

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.440
and you can get rid of it.

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:49.000
It's just to make yourselves available

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.360
when the morning sun is about to come.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:59.320
Alcohol itself is such a left-sided nonsense.

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:02.280
So much so that once the Goddess drank

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.440
all the alcohols of the world.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:10.200
You won't believe, all the alcohols!

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:19.520
Saints like Sainath smoked all the tobacco of Maharastra,

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:22.640
but still they are smoking.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:29.080
Like Shiva drank the whole of the poison

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.840
because He is the giver of life.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.280
Whatever They have worked so much,

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.560
so sincerely,

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:43.720
earnestly with complete concentration.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.160
You see Me working like that,

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:49.320
but They have also worked the same way.

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:54.760
So don't take things for granted!

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:00.240
I have told many of you to write down,

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.480
what have I done for Sahaja Yoga today?

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:08.400
For myself I'll do everything - I'll paint my house,

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:14.600
I'll paint my kitchen, everything,

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.800
I'll have a nice sari done up, blouse done up.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.640
Myself.

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:24.880
What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:29.440
How many presents I have given to others?

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:34.560
How many letters I've written to others?

00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:38.160
What experiences I have written down?

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.560
Above all,

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.680
how many times I have felt the love of my Mother in my heart?

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:50.200
But I'll tell you the reason in the West

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.320
why the big problem is, I've discovered it now.

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.160
As I discovered Sahaja Yoga,

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:57.320
also I've discovered the secret

00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:00.440
which I am telling you today.

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:12.600
This is also the Shakti of penetration

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:22.320
that one can find out the demons,

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.040
how they work in our minds,

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.440
how they prosper.

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.360
I think I've told some people,

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.600
but I am going to tell you all.

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:36.440
When we are children,

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:39.600
till the age of five years,

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:42.080
we are ego-oriented

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:46.160
in the sense that we are just looking after ourselves.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:49.600
You give ten toys to ten children,

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.080
they'll take their toys and play with each other,

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:55.280
don't talk to anyone, they'll just go and play.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.600
They'll not disturb another one,

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.200
it's all parallel living.

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:01.320
They won't disturb.

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:03.120
If they disturb, they might beat,

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.160
they might do something else nonsensical.

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:08.440
This might be due to some sort of a bhoot in them

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.440
as children.

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:15.160
But when they are five years of age,

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:19.000
supposing now, you ask somebody, a child from here,

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.480
"See now, what do you see?"

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:23.480
He says, "I see a tiger here, and these flowers,

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.120
this, this, all this I see."

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:27.160
But if you make him stand there,

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.480
supposing somebody's standing that side,

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:32.560
what will he see? Still he will say he sees tiger,

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:36.400
flowers, this that. You try.

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:40.480
Because he cannot see the point of view of another person.

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.600
He's just busy with his ego.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:47.960
Now the whole culture in the West, I have found now

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.560
- I don't know, formally it was not so,

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:54.680
parents had a great grip over the children,

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:56.880
and they had responsibility of children,

00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:00.680
they behaved well so that children should be all right.

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:04.840
Not like before the children they go on fighting
with each other.

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:07.200
I mean, they must be fighting little bit,

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.240
but in the bedrooms they must be doing.

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:13.240
Because I have not seen films, when I was young,

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.320
where the husband/wife are only all the time fighting,

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:18.280
or going for divorce.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.280
No, at all, understanding between husband and wife,

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:23.320
but when it is another woman or another man,

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.440
their face is going like this.

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.240
If you see on the street

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.560
two people going with each other like this,

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:33.720
then you know these two are not husband and wife.

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.400
This is modern times.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.080
These are modern times.

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.000
And the West is the worst.

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:47.920
So what happens that the parents are also not grown up,

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:51.120
they are not matured, they have no sense of responsibility.

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:54.000
They have got children, how to behave with the husband,

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.400
specially the women here are extremely,

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.640
extremely dominating and stupid.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:01.920
I must say.

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.440
They don't know anything about cooking;

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.280
they don't know anything about anything.

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.360
They can only carrier girls, they can go,

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:13.320
sit in the bank and write something.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.080
And they're extremely stupid;

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.640
they don't know how to handle their husbands,

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.720
they don't know how to handle their children.

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.240
They have had no training.

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:25.480
Their mother's paid no attention to them.

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.560
No disciplining at all.

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:32.760
So this-ego oriented child is still ego-oriented.

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:35.520
No love, no affection.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:38.400
We would say My Mother was a very strict person.

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:39.800
Extremely strict.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.120
But she was extremely loving also - extremely loving,

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:46.400
extremely strict, just like Jagadamba.

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.360
I mean, she would make us cook food,

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.320
even the handle how you hold.

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:54.200
She would tell us, "This is not the angle,

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.520
it's not the way, you do this way!

00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:59.720
Why are you standing like this?

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.600
Where is your attention?"

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.480
And no questions were to be asked.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:08.080
All that disciplining and all that thing

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:12.240
which came to us in our childhood is today helpful to us.

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:16.040
And they were extremely loving.

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.520
They were for our benevolence,

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.800
whatever they did were for our benevolence.

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:23.920
But I think, specially in Switzerland,

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:27.240
I always felt that the mothers are uneducated

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.560
and they're extremely jealous of their daughters also.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:35.280
Our mothers, My mother was very well educated,

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.080
but her mother was not.

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:40.240
But she was a wise woman.

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:44.040
She had her sense of responsibility,

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.680
she knows she was a mother

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:47.840
and she has to behave herself.

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:50.720
She has not to be childish and stupid.

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:55.120
So because that love was not given to these ladies,

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.720
they are still ego-oriented.

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.200
They're still babies.

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.920
They're not yet grown up.

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:09.480
Still they cannot see the other person's point of view

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:12.400
and they become extremely obstinate:

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.680
"No, this is true!"

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.440
Now let us face it,

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.240
today you have had this Puja of Adi Shakti,

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.320
is a dangerous one,

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:23.160
because this is like a mirror

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:26.400
where you will have to see yourself

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:30.520
clearly, face yourself.

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:38.680
To dominate your husband is a stupid nonsense.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:42.160
Because you don't know

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.440
how to handle your husband, that's why.

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:49.120
I would say Indian women dominate

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.680
their husbands all right, in a way.

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:54.760
The husbands can't do without their wives,

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:57.000
can't do without their wives.

00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:00.040
They don't know even how to pack their things,

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.280
they don't know how to even make tea,

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.040
they don't know how to boil an egg,

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:06.320
they don't know anything.

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:10.200
They don't know even how to lock the house,

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.800
open

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:21.160
even open the wardrobe,

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:22.800
how to spread a bed.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.600
They don't know anything whatsoever that is practical.

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.040
I mean I would say that

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.080
my husband would always come and ask Me,

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:37.960
"Is this tie all right?"

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:40.040
I mean this is since long, now he knows I'm Adi Shakti,

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.360
but before also.

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:45.800
He used to come and ask,

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.640
"Is it all right?" "No, no it's no good."

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:49.880
All right, he would change.

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:55.280
But because you are not grown up,

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:56.560
you are not matured,

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.440
you don't know how to handle your husbands.

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.440
You try to dominate.

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.560
And then the children learn from you,

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:04.840
they also try to dominate you.

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:12.240
Apparently, you must understand,

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:15.200
it is

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.320
the authority coming from the top.

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:22.000
Like I always will say,

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:24.920
"I am not God, Sadashiva is God."

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:28.280
Gregoire was quiet shocked when I told him first this thing.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.680
But I am God also.

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:34.960
Without Me what is He? I'm His Power.

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:37.200
He's powerless.

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:42.480
But let Him be God, good.

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:48.880
Because if you have to blame someone,

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:52.040
you blame Him, He's God.

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:56.240
But I have to work hard to keep Him pleased.

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:59.120
Otherwise you know, He doesn't care for anyone.

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:02.280
He'll just destroy, that's all He knows.

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:05.000
He'll destroy you,

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:07.120
anybody tries to play any tricks with Me,

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:11.160
He'll destroy you so badly that for lives together

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:13.000
you cannot become a human being.

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:15.360
He's like that, a terrible fellow.

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:19.320
He's the One Who has done all these things, you know.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.400
So, we have to grow.

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:29.560
We have to grow as wise women,

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:37.360
as women who are like the Mother Earth, as I told you.

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.200
And when you ask me that

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:44.320
"Mother, You work so hard, and You look so fresh."

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:47.400
Because I enjoy it.

00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:50.000
It's like a music to Me.

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.360
Doing work is a music to Me.

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:55.440
Cooking is a music to Me.

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:58.280
Everything is a music to Me.

00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.520
Do you get tired of music?

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:03.200
On the contrary you feel fresh.

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.280
And when I kill demons,

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.120
as you must have seen there,

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:12.280
I get more enlightened, more light comes into Me.

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:15.240
It's the other way round.

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:23.320
So, I have to make you understand that

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:29.480
today please have full introspection,

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:32.200
soul search.

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:36.320
Find out what's wrong with us.

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:41.400
Do not pamper your ego,

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.520
because ego makes you idiotic,

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.240
that you must have seen.

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.360
We have some people in Sahaja Yoga

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:49.160
who are like that, idiots.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:51.520
But they think knowing of themselves.

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:52.760
We all know that.

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:56.880
We have to have some buffoons also in the circus.

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:06.160
But we have to have lions and tigers.

00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:14.760
What impresses the people are the lions and the tigers

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:17.880
and not the buffoons.

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:22.040
So, it is important, let us have the introspection

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:24.080
and see for ourselves

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:28.280
how much we have done for Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:34.560
Of course, I have to congratulate you for one thing.

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:38.000
Because, you know, I am like that.

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:42.400
I have done nothing to be like that, I'm just like that,

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.240
I am.

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:46.040
So I'm the Power!

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:49.560
If I have the Power, because I am the Power.

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:57.400
What is there to feel very elated about it?

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:02.560
I do not feel that way at all.

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:09.240
But if I do not use My Power,

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:14.000
then I become like a human being.

00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:18.280
Why I am the Goddess?

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:22.400
Because I use every bit of My Power.

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:28.480
And if you people do not use your power,

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:32.360
out of any nonsense, any fear you may have.

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:37.280
You may have any kind of a temptation,

00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.880
or restriction, anything.

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:44.560
If you're not going all out to use your power of love,

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:47.400
then you cannot ascent.

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:51.080
So the whole thing if you see so clearly,

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:54.320
the whole Power of your Mother is of love.

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:59.400
Whatever She does is out of Her love for Her creation.

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:08.000
And the introspection starts,

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.880
but it should not be late.

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.240
I used to say since long

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:13.560
the way they are exhausting the Mother Earth,

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:15.080
making so many things.

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:16.800
You must have heard Me saying this,

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.200
for the last eighteen years I've been saying this.

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:22.240
Today now ecological problems

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:25.200
standing like a rakshasa before you.

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:27.640
Now what do you do with him?

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.160
So you face then.

00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:40.240
Automatically you have to face yourself, your destruction.

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:44.440
Introspection, if you do not do now,

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:49.480
you'll face it at a time when it will be very late.

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:53.640
So don't be just satisfied with yourself,

00:47:53.840 --> 00:48:00.000
that you have now Sahaja Yogi, so done.

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:04.800
If you have come to My Puja of course,

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:07.360
like if you fall into the sea,

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:11.160
the sea has a power to absorb you.

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:14.640
But also has a power to throw you back on the shores.

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:17.520
It acts both ways.

00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:23.440
So why can't I go deep into Sahaja Yoga?

00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:35.280
There are excuses also: I have got no time, I am very busy,

00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:37.720
I am working in the office, I am doing that.

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:39.920
Then you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:45.360
All your time is for Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:49.840
But because of that,

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:53.360
Sahaja Yoga gives you sufficient time to do everything.

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:01.000
I know of people,

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:03.880
whom I suddenly find in the Pujas,

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:07.680
sometimes in Vancouver, sometimes in San Diego,

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:09.760
sometimes here.

00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:12.440
I said, "How are you here, what about your business?"

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:14.440
He said, "The business has brought us here,

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:17.120
exactly on this date."

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:23.120
When this Power is so great, to realize it,

00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:26.320
to know how great it is,

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:29.800
then you leave everything to this Power.

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:32.920
It works out for you everything.

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.240
So today we are talking about Shakti,

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:41.480
about the Power of the Goddess,

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:46.000
which are much more to be discovered

00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:49.280
and too intricate,

00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:53.680
very well balanced and extremely efficient.

00:49:56.160 --> 00:50:01.520
But whatever work these Powers have done within you,

00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:04.800
please try to respect them.

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:16.480
Please, try to assimilate them,

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:21.120
and let your being grow.

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:24.520
Don't say that "Now I'm married,"

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:26.760
or that "I've got pregnancy,"

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:30.960
that "I've got children, I've got jobs," nothing.

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:35.080
Everything becomes perfect,

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:39.200
as soon as you perfect yourself.

00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:44.360
Everything is related to your perfection.

00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:48.040
Then you don't ask Me question,

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:50.000
"What job I have to do Mother,

00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:55.120
what I have to achieve?"

00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:58.040
Nothing.

00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:04.320
You just see your way through and everything works out.

00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:12.880
So, all the demons were killed,

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:17.160
they are again back in their own seats.

00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:19.800
The worst thing is they have entered

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.440
into the heads of the seekers,

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:25.640
because they have come as gurus now.

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:30.200
They've come as Catholic Church,

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:32.480
as Protestant Church,

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:36.280
as all kinds of temples

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:40.240
and all kinds of fundamentalist and all that.

00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:43.400
All they look like rakshasas also,

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.680
if you look at them.

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:51.040
And when they influence you, they go into your heads.

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:53.200
But after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:55.360
even those heads are cleansed

00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:58.480
and you are all right, out of it.

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:01.720
But then what to do with this,

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.720
with doing all this work,

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:12.240
cleansing, and giving joy, and everything, then what to do?

00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:16.480
You have to give it to others!

00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:20.680
This is your responsibility.

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:25.200
So first of all your character, your behavior,

00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:29.880
your relationships should be so pure

00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:33.160
that, by itself, it will emit light.

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:39.040
Like if you have a very clean glass,

00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:41.520
the light can pass.

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:50.280
But also, Kundalini being the pure desire,

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:55.400
you must have a very fervent and extremely bubbling,

00:52:55.600 --> 00:53:02.360
you can call it a absolutely pouring out desire

00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:06.440
whom to give vibrations, now, whom to give realization.

00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:10.320
You give it to the trees,

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:13.360
you give it to the dogs, you give it to anyone,

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:17.360
and if you find human beings also give them.

00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:21.160
Rather difficult.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.480
So, that has to be done.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.440
But whatever you are doing,

00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:39.600
keep attention in your connection.

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:42.200
But here they are doing Sahaja Yoga,

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:44.200
and there your connection is loose,

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:46.320
then what you are giving? Sahaja Yog or what?

00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:49.400
You are giving darkness?

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:53.120
Your are giving ignorance.

00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:58.040
You are giving madness.

00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:04.120
So, to this powerful Shakti

00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:11.320
you must all the time keep connection, and keep Her pleased.

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:13.920
Like the protocol

00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:18.080
is very important because all these you see.

00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:24.800
They have the protocol sense, because They are fixed.

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:30.120
You should also fix your protocol properly.

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:36.800
It's rather

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:46.760
difficult or embarrassing

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:51.480
as a human being for Me to tell you

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:54.680
what should be the protocol of the Goddess. Really.

00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:56.920
But I have to tell you;

00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:59.880
because I don't want you should be harmed.

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:03.400
But the protocol must be observed

00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:10.760
and could be understood very well.

00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:15.080
Of course, it's much better now.

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:22.160
First time they had My Puja, in Delhi,

00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:26.720
they did My aarti with a plastic plate,

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:30.840
and the kum-kum was kept in plastic boxes,

00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:33.840
and I was so much worried about these people

00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:37.040
that My whole body had shrunk like this controlling Them,

00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:39.320
"Now don't do anything!"

00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:45.280
If you see My photograph you'll see Me very different.

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:48.920
I was so surprised they didn't know what to do.

00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:54.200
All right, now, please also

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:59.760
pay attention to your protocol.

00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:03.160
For example people walk just early in the morning

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:06.400
in their pajamas, that's not proper.

00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:08.880
You must dress up properly.

00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:13.360
You're going, you don't know what Adi Shakti is.

00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:16.200
Or you know?

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:19.720
If you know then you are going to face Adi Shakti.

00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:25.600
Protocol must be understood.

00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:33.000
For that, luckily, in India, people have lot of sense;

00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:36.320
also they are sometimes missing in it.

00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:43.440
So, protocol is very important

00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:46.000
because These will be really furious

00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:49.040
if you don't keep the protocol.

00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:58.440
That is extremely important.

00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:01.760
That's why Christ has said

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:04.560
He'll "tolerate anything against Myself,

00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:07.760
but nothing against the Holy Ghost."

00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:11.280
And also He has said that,

00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.600
"Beware of the murmuring souls"

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:18.360
because if you murmur on My back, I hear everything.

00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:21.760
They're reporting all the time.

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:26.320
If you do anything on My back, I know what's happening.

00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:33.520
I give time. But then it acts.

00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:40.000
It's for your benevolence, for your good,

00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:45.120
for your ascent for which you have fought for ages!

00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:48.000
You must respect yourself

00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:52.160
that you are seekers,

00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:55.440
and now you have found out the truth.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.480
So, make a crown out of it,

00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:00.680
and put it on your head.

00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:03.920
Now you are like lords.

00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:11.280
Unless and until

00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:17.640
you know what powers you have and how you got them,

00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:20.360
and you remember it,

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:25.880
and also this truth becomes part and parcel of you,

00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:29.160
your growth is going to be difficult.

00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:31.200
You'll be neither here nor there,

00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:34.080
hanging in the air like a pendulum going here to there,

00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:36.280
left to the right, right to the left.

00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:39.520
And a Sahaja Yogini should be ashamed to say

00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:43.200
that "I'll go on the left, or I'll go on the right."

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.520
How can you be so vulnerable?

00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:51.600
Because you have not grown.

00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:55.840
You have to be like Rock of Gibraltar.

00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:00.360
How can you catch?

00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:05.160
All right, if you think somebody is extremely negative,

00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:07.640
don't go near that person.

00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:13.440
But you cannot become a dainty darlings.

00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:23.680
My children are viras, shivalrous.

00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:26.360
They have to be.

00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:28.560
You are My children.

00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:32.240
You are no more Christians, Hindus, Muslims,

00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:40.320
you are no more all these horrible demonic people,

00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:42.960
but you are My children and you have to be brave,

00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:44.680
you have to be righteous,

00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:46.560
you have to be good, you have to be compassionate,

00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:48.920
you have to be dynamic.

00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:51.320
That's the minimum.

00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:56.920
I hope after this Puja you'll sit down,

00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:59.920
meditate and do introspection,

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:05.840
and find out, "Why I do it? What is the problem?"

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:11.640
Say, some people yesterday were dozing off, I saw them.

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:14.600
Because of left Nabhi.

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:18.640
So correct your left Nabhi.

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:30.960
But if you are really connected with this Divine Power,

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:34.400
you may keep awake for three days and three nights,

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:35.840
you'll not be tired.

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:38.280
It has happened with you sometimes.

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:40.560
But attention should be on the Power,

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.400
attention should be on the connection

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.960
that we have with this Power.

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:49.480
Then only. Otherwise you'll be exhausted, naturally.

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:53.720
Everything's so logical, so logical it is.

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:58.880
Thank God, and thank yourself,

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.400
thank your luck you're so fortunate

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:05.120
that you are very few who have achieved this connection,

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:08.000
and that you are sucking that power

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.280
within yourself so easily.

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.520
And what are you, why are you behaving

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:18.120
like this ordinary street people with your stupid questions?

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:30.560
You'll be surprised that Goddess,

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:35.400
in previous lives, never spoke so much as I've spoken.

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:39.400
One or two words were sufficient,

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:45.360
like She said, "Hoo!" and killed this, "Ha!" finished that.

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:47.440
All these things She managed

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:49.800
only by saying "Hoo, Ha, Hee, Hey".

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:55.880
But They never gave Realization to anyone,

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:58.560
none of the Incarnations.

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:01.520
They said, "No, no, no, no, no not Me.

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:05.600
Not Me, sorry, I'm not going to do it.

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:09.800
They must have seen human beings how stupid they are.

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:13.000
"Oh God, nothing. I'm all right.

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:16.960
I can go to jungle for fourteen years,

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:22.760
I can do the driver's job with Arjuna,

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:27.160
or I can get crucified, or I can take poison,

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:30.240
but don't tell Me to deal with human beings!

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:32.440
No, no, no, no.

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:36.880
Is better to go to a zoo than to go to this."

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:41.680
And that's why none of Them, none of Them,

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.360
and some of Them did not even talk about it,

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:47.560
thinking that "If We talk, they'll say,

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:50.640
"Then why not give us the Realization?"

01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:54.440
None of them.

01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:02.360
So this is the Adi Shakti's compassion, love, and confidence

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:07.600
that you should have also confidence.

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.120
Not only that I have given you Realization,

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:11.640
but I have given you powers

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:14.640
that you can give Realizations to others.

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:17.400
None of these Incarnations did that,

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.680
which you are doing today.

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.520
With all Their Powers, They did not do it,

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.560
while you can do it,

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:34.760
despite the fact the instruments are not so strong,

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:38.640
not so Divine.

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:46.440
But still, still, we have to come up,

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.240
and work out in our own lives

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:56.720
the priorities that we have.

01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:00.920
For the Gods the priorities were only Divine work,

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.920
nothing else.

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:06.400
Nobody took up a job, nobody.

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:11.760
Nobody went to university, nobody studied.

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:17.240
Only thing They did

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:24.000
was the work of God.

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:33.320
So you do everything else as work of God

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.960
and that's how the energy will flow into you.

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:43.880
When you start doing the work of God,

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:47.200
everything you do becomes work of God

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:52.000
in the sense that you do the work of God, you decide,

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:54.760
"I'm going to do the work of God," then God takes over.

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:56.800
He does all the rest of the things,

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.080
you do only the work of God, He takes over.

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:05.120
I hope you understand this, try.

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:08.480
Try.

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:11.120
Have confidence.

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:19.160
And also thank God there is Someone, like your Mother,

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:21.440
Who can tell you what's wrong with you.

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:23.640
Thank God!

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:26.240
Even your mothers didn't tell you what was wrong,

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:29.360
because they were so frightened of you.

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:35.280
And don't say then - then, when you say something,

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:38.000
"Mother, my heart catches."

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.680
I mean, what can you do, then?

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:48.000
If you understand that this is for your improvement

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:52.440
I am doing it, it's out of love, out of concern,

01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:56.560
then you'll work it out.

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:02.560
But I don't think it is so much of a mental understanding,

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:08.000
but it's the understanding of a higher level,

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:12.920
where it becomes just part and parcel of your awareness.

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:15.680
"How can it be wrong?

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:20.040
It's all has to be good for me, everything is good for me."

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:25.840
Last but not the least,

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:30.800
one must understand that as all these seven chakras

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.000
I am working on are in a collective way held

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:37.760
by Me in My Virata.

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:40.720
The quality of Viratangana is that,

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:46.000
that She creates this universal awareness within us,

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:48.640
the collectivity.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:56.000
And, if you do not realize that in modern times

01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:03.120
we are in a spiritual path in a collective way only.

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.600
This is what it is.

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:12.680
Because we have reached to the state of Sahasrara

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:19.680
and here we have to have a collective working only,

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:22.920
there's no other way out!

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:29.720
This is what is to be absolutely realized.

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:36.720
Anybody who tries to harm the collectivity by bad behavior,

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:38.960
or by anything,

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.400
will be thrown out, no doubt,

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:46.720
but also will fall into wrong hands.

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:51.560
So collectivity is the work of Adi Shakti.

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:54.280
Because at the Sahasrara,

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:56.200
at the Sahasrara,

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:59.720
at the Sahasrara is the rule of Virata.

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:03.240
And the Power of Virata is the Viratangana.

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:06.360
Is the One Who does collectivity.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.080
This is the most important point we must know

01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:15.720
if we cannot be collective - because of anything,

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:19.200
jealousy maybe, inferiority complex maybe, any,

01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:21.400
anything which is coming from behind

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:23.960
like a worm crawling up -then,

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:26.400
know that something wrong with you,

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.640
nothing wrong with the collectivity.

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:32.520
Don't criticize the collectivity,

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:36.720
till I Myself find it out, and I'll put it right.

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:40.120
Keep to the collectivity, wisely

01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:46.320
and earnestly and try to keep the collectivity together.

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:54.360
Try to help to keep the people collective to enjoy together.

01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:57.080
Don't criticize each other;

01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:59.600
only criticize yourself.

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:02.600
If you are in the habit of criticism,

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:04.680
better criticize yourself.

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:07.960
It's better, because these are habits also.

01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:11.440
People, specially I've seen people in the West,

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.000
they react to everything.

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:14.400
If they see this carpet,

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:16.160
"Uh! I don't like it!"

01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:18.360
But this is not yours, not made for you,

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:20.200
what have you got to do with it?

01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:23.320
"No, I don't like it!" But it's not yours,

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:25.320
what's the question?

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:28.360
It's lying here, why should you be so upset about it?

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:33.160
"I don't like that person! I don't like that dress!"

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:36.400
Who are you?

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.680
"I don't like."

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:46.600
This is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga - "I don't like."

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:52.960
There is a way of saying things.

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:57.160
But there is no need to say anything whatsoever.

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:05.840
So all this kind of bumptiousness

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:10.800
and showing off is against collectivity.

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:15.360
Then there are some other stupid type of people

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:18.560
who are always there to take My photograph I've seen.

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:22.040
You tell them, "Don't be so forward, don't go."

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:25.360
"No, I will, I don't do this, I am not. Finished!"

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:29.400
But they, some of them are really confirmed,

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:34.480
certified I think, stupid, idiots.

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:36.280
They cannot be improved.

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:39.520
But I told you that don't make them your ideals,

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:42.600
don't follow their images.

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:47.440
So then, we come to this point,

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:54.400
that Adi Shakti's work is the most important work

01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:57.880
in the whole creation.

01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:00.160
All right killing the demons was over,

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:02.280
what is it?

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:03.520
Done!

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:08.160
Saraswati's work was done, She created dinosaurs so what?

01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:09.760
Mahalakshmi's work was done.

01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:12.880
She brought you to human level, all right, so what?

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:16.800
But the climax is now that you have got your Realization,

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000
that you have got this special quality,

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:24.360
that now you have entered into the Kingdom of God.

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:26.760
So now behave yourself.

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:30.600
And also you must have that dignity to know that,

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:34.640
now we have entered into the Kingdom of God.

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:42.400
I've seen, once I was going to see the President of India.

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:45.560
But to Me he was another human being,

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:47.800
I mean, it never goes into My head this presidentship

01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:49.280
and all that.

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:50.680
I was walking up,

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:53.240
and those who were walking with Me became very conscious,

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:54.200
you see, like this.

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:56.240
I said, "What's the matter with these people?

01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:58.680
Have they seen some ghost or something?"

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:01.240
Just going on the steps.

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:04.880
And they were some people standing with, you see,

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:07.800
spears and things as guards,

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.360
or whatever it is. So, I was just laughing at all that.

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:14.440
But these people became very conscious.

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:19.040
When you are entering into the Kingdom of God,

01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:23.840
how conscious you should be about your behavior!

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:29.880
How you should be,

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:32.640
how you should behave?

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:46.040
Just feel the uniqueness of your personality

01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:49.400
that you are in the Kingdom of God already.

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:51.080
Just feel it.

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.240
If you can feel only that,

01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:58.440
then you will know what a place of pride you have got

01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:01.600
and how dignified you should be.

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:04.120
How beautiful you should be.

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:12.400
How neat and clean and sweet you should be.

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:17.800
How much maryadas you must know, everything.

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:28.880
And when you will realize that now you are the coveted,

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:37.120
or we can say the highest citizens of the Kingdom of God,

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:44.360
then you have to prove that you have really realized it.

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:46.960
That you really feel that.

01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:52.640
And you should feel extremely joyful, happy.

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:56.360
Like yesterday, at the smallest thing everybody's laughing

01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:58.080
like the other street people.

01:13:58.280 --> 01:13:59.520
It's not the Sahaja Yoga.

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:01.640
If there was a big joke or something, laugh,

01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:04.600
otherwise somebody is talking, you're laughing.

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:09.600
I was surprised, you're Sahaja Yogis.

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:13.520
Think of saints doing this, will they do?

01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:16.440
You are saints;

01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:19.720
you are munindras with smanana,

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:24.960
with your meditation you have become the kings.

01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:31.600
How can you behave in a indignified manner?

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:36.480
Now, try to assume your position!

01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:40.760
Try to feel it.

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:46.320
Yesterday, of course, when the last song started,

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:53.600
it did penetrate, I know, into many souls, to many hearts,

01:14:54.480 --> 01:15:00.560
that unique joy, which we call as nirananda.

01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:03.120
I did feel it yesterday.

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:07.280
But keep it up, it's just to be kept very safely

01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:11.440
into your Khumbas, is the Kundalini.

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:14.120
And She is the One Who has come up.

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:17.280
So, My idea was that

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:21.040
today is not only the worship of the Khumba,

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:25.640
where the Kundalini resides,

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:30.720
but the Khumba becomes like a flower pot.

01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:36.360
It's like that, that has happened

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:40.520
and then it can also, as somebody said that,

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:46.800
"Mother these flower pots also can become table lamps."

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:50.240
I said, "See, now, you've said it!"

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:54.640
So the Khumba becoming flowers, and flowers becoming light,

01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:00.440
and the lights with fragrance!

01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:03.360
I hope you'll understand My vision

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:05.320
and you'll stand by Me,

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:07.280
you'll come up to that.

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:11.520
I depend on you entirely for My vision.

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:15.080
We have to change this whole world into a beautiful place.

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:19.480
Now for that not much sacrifice is needed.

01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:22.720
You're already blessed, you don't have to do much,

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:29.800
only thing is keep your attention on the source of Power.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.840
May God bless you.

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:40.320
Ah? Thank you.

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:43.960
Mathias says, "We promise." You all say that.

01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:58.600
Thank you very much.

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:18.080
You should all write some of the miracles,

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:22.400
and how things work out.

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:27.120
Like we went to Paris,

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:30.440
and they wanted to buy some saris for the ladies here,

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:34.280
and nowhere we could get anything forty-five inches.

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:36.240
Either it was thirty-six inches,

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:39.440
or it was fifty-eight inches.

01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:45.560
Then while going in the car, suddenly I said, "Now stop!"

01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:48.400
They said, "What Mother? In the street?" I said,

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:51.480
"In the street only there is somebody selling the saris."

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:54.560
And we got them.

01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:59.000
Another - you have seen already

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:02.560
in the Ganapatipule Ganesh Puja,

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:10.080
that how we had a jackpot for your presents.

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:14.680
You used to always bring presents, very expensive and

01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:19.560
of no artistic value, anything,

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:21.480
wasting so much money.

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:25.800
Even national Pujas, you could not get anything.

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:31.640
And how we got this, just the same way.

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:34.520
Coming from the airport I just said,

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:36.520
"Now there's something here!"

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:38.320
They said, "Mother, nothing there's a shop."

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:40.040
I said, "Let's go and see!"

01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:44.080
Just we went round, and there all this things at a song.

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:47.080
Now same thing happened in America,

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:50.200
I went down, I said, "The China is in trouble,

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:51.840
let's buy something Chinese."

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:53.960
So we went to the Chinese shops;

01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:58.120
they were so expensive, very expensive.

01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:00.600
And I turned the corner and I said,

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:03.280
"All right let me go into a little lane,"

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:07.240
and there it was, a shop which sold everything very cheaply,

01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:09.200
for again forty percent less.

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:11.560
Something has to do with forty percent.

01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:17.320
And just by chance only, I think,

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:21.480
hundred meters away they were selling at five times more,

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:24.760
six times more. And why it is?

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:27.920
So now you also try.

01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:32.280
But desire should be pure, understanding should be pure.

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:34.240
So I just thought that these Sahaja Yogis

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:37.000
spend so much money, waste so much money,

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:39.760
and get something which is of no value.

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:42.600
Because all the presents you give Me, actually,

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:46.040
I have been asking them to stop it, and stop it and stop it.

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:47.480
Now from individual,

01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:50.600
we have brought it to the level of national.

01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:52.480
But even in the national,

01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:55.520
I think we now should just have no national,

01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:57.440
but one international, if you can manage next year

01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:59.040
if you people agree.

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:01.960
But whatever it is,

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:04.960
whatever you give Me, I'm not going to sell it,

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:06.680
I'm not going to give it to anyone,

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:08.720
it should be such that we can keep

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:11.440
for the progeny to see what you have given.

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.680
It is the value of this is this,

01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:16.760
not the value how much you spent.

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:19.560
So, there is no need for individually

01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:23.000
to give Me any presents at all, I know you love Me.

01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:26.240
And now, I don't know, I've been telling the leaders

01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:29.280
that "Please don't ask for the national present,

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:30.960
now don't waste money."

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:33.200
But I don't know if they are not yet agreeing,

01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:36.280
and if they agree we can stop this.

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:38.720
And have even international present

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:41.520
which could be also brought down.

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:43.960
Because you know, I don't need anything.

01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:45.960
But it works.

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:47.680
It works.

01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:50.480
Like I said, "You give Me ivory this time,"

01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:52.800
and ivory was so very expensive, everything,

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.440
again that also we found it at a such a cheap place.

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:01.000
And once you gave Me the ivory,

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:03.720
you won't believe, I read in the newspaper

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:06.720
that ivory used to be five hundreds dollars per kilo,

01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:10.400
now in America it is three dollars per kilo.

01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:14.400
It's true or not?

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:18.360
And also the idea is to give more encouragement

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:20.880
to handicrafts and to art,

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:22.880
because so many times I have told that

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:27.640
a little of a clay you can take and make it

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:31.000
into a beautiful thing which is worth such a lot.

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:33.320
So, why should we exhaust this Mother Earth?

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:37.120
Why not we have few artistic nice things,

01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:40.400
instead of having so many things?

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:43.640
But if you go in the shops now you don't get anything.

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:46.200
You don't get silk, you cannot get this,

01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:47.840
you cannot get that.

01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:50.560
So difficult to get anything natural,

01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:54.800
because people have only making unnatural things.

01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:59.880
Whatever it is, in that also you should create beauty.

01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:01.680
If you start creating beauty,

01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:03.760
then we'll try to preserve it

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:07.160
and use it sparingly instead of having thousands

01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:10.600
of nonsensical things, everything disposable.

01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:12.280
After sometime,

01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:15.440
we'll have to have human beings who are disposal.

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:17.440
We'll have to dispose them off.

01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:18.840
How will they live on this earth

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:20.720
if we do not understand that

01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:25.960
we have to live on this earth with its limitations.

01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:29.360
See, I've been telling you, many times,

01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:33.320
take to artistic things, take to handmade things,

01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:35.040
more to handmade.

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:38.120
Don't go too much to this.

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:41.400
At least, even if you have to buy something

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:45.320
which is, say, artificial,

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:49.040
at least see to it that it is artistic.

01:22:55.320 --> 01:23:01.120
So, the once you have a great desire

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:04.480
- today is the day they want in the whole world to pray

01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:06.800
for the preservation of Mother Earth,

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.040
that's why I started this topic,

01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:12.760
that we should pray that we all should develop art,

01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:17.000
develop for ourselves, give as presents to others,

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:22.240
and also to use artistic things, made of artist.

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:24.800
We can have few things,

01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:29.880
but artistic which expresses art.

01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:34.120
Not cheap things.

01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:37.400
In the whole of France

01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:43.160
what I saw was that into everything this plastics has crept

01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:47.240
in whether it is cotton, whether it is silk,

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:49.000
whether it is wool.

01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:52.280
It can enter into everywhere

01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:57.600
except for the brains of human beings. It's horrible.

01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:59.880
So, whatever it is,

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:06.160
in that also see that you buy artistic things,

01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:13.880
not plain, horrible, cheap things.

01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:18.120
All right? So this is what we have to today,

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:22.280
also, you have to pray to Me when you are doing puja,

01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:26.960
that "Oh, Mother, Oh Mother, please save our earth,

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:29.840
and give people wisdom,

01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:33.080
that they should behave themselves.

01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:34.400
And they should be conscious".

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:38.400
And every Sahaja Yogi should be conscious

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:42.440
about how much energy he is using of electricity,

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:48.640
of telephones, or of water or of anything.

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:52.200
We have to be frugal about it.

01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:55.880
If we do not take the responsibility of these things,

01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:58.520
then it will not penetrate anywhere else.

01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:01.240
It is for you to do it.

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:07.320
You have to take it up in your everyday life

01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:11.360
as a part and parcel of your life

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:16.480
that you try to save the energy of this Mother Earth.

01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:18.720
Is very important.

01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:24.720
So today is the day they have sent a special prayer,

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:27.880
of course it's done by some churches of whatever it is,

01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:29.560
but I think is a good day,

01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:31.400
because they must have thought today

01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:33.560
is the day of the Goddess,

01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:37.200
and that's how they've asked for.

01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:42.840
May God bless you.

01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:15.920
And fourteen married ladies

01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:24.440
who have not been yet for My puja.
