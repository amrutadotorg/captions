WEBVTT

00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:03.959
Shivaratri Puja, Pune,
17 March 2002.

00:14:00.601 --> 00:14:09.768
Tonight we have gathered here to do Shri Shiva Puja.

00:14:19.809 --> 00:14:28.850
Those people who have a clean heart can only do Shiva Puja.

00:14:30.351 --> 00:14:38.017
Those whose heart is not clean cannot do Shiva Puja.

00:14:39.309 --> 00:14:44.975
It's a simple principle of Shri Shivaratri.

00:14:56.892 --> 00:15:01.975
As you have seen yesterday, we have snakes,

00:15:03.017 --> 00:15:07.601
or, these are horrible snakes

00:15:12.309 --> 00:15:17.100
guiding behind the Shiva Linga.

00:15:18.934 --> 00:15:26.434
The significance is this - those who are clean in heart,

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:34.100
who are full of love for others,

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:46.934
are always guarded by the power of Shiva,

00:15:47.184 --> 00:15:49.850
which are the snakes.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:57.850
It's a symbolic thing, to say, very symbolic.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:03.184
But I must say that animals understand

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:10.017
Divine force much better than human beings, much better.

00:16:11.434 --> 00:16:14.434
Because they have a clean heart.

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:24.684
Whatever is their lifestyle built by nature,

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.684
they carry on with it.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:32.975
But there's no malice, there's no jealousy,

00:16:33.017 --> 00:16:38.017
there's not all these mean things in their heart.

00:16:38.476 --> 00:16:41.476
They do it because it is supposed to be.

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:49.100
But the quality of human beings is only one

00:16:50.184 --> 00:16:55.476
- and that is how much they love and forgive.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:03.309
Loving capacity of human beings are such by

00:17:03.684 --> 00:17:07.850
which they conquer all their negative forces -

00:17:07.934 --> 00:17:12.309
they can, easily, see that it's not good

00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:15.476
to have all these qualities,

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:20.100
or maybe that they understand it's not noble

00:17:20.184 --> 00:17:25.850
to indulge into all these inhuman behaviour.

00:17:28.934 --> 00:17:35.476
They are not bound to indulge into all these things.

00:17:37.309 --> 00:17:44.850
Neither they are asked to be,

00:17:46.934 --> 00:17:55.768
but suddenly they get lured by such things which has got hatred,

00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:04.100
jealously and greed.

00:18:07.476 --> 00:18:09.934
You see how Shiva lives.

00:18:11.351 --> 00:18:13.184
He lives in the Himalayas.

00:18:14.601 --> 00:18:19.601
See what clothes He wears, what He eats.

00:18:20.017 --> 00:18:26.184
He has no demand for anything because He's complete, He's perfect.

00:18:29.601 --> 00:18:33.809
Such a personality is Shiva's.

00:18:34.184 --> 00:18:38.017
And if you are worshipping Him,

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:41.809
you should find out within your heart

00:18:42.351 --> 00:18:51.850
what sort of feelings you have, what sort of malice you nurture.

00:18:51.934 --> 00:18:58.351
These days in India, greed has become the main point.

00:18:59.768 --> 00:19:03.643
They are so mean and so low.

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:13.975
Which impossible to understand that they think money is everything,

00:19:15.809 --> 00:19:19.850
which is not in the culture of Indians, no, no.

00:19:20.184 --> 00:19:21.850
In no way.

00:19:22.184 --> 00:19:25.768
But somehow they have picked it up,

00:19:26.059 --> 00:19:28.351
in the foreign countries perhaps,

00:19:28.768 --> 00:19:31.184
and it is spreading very much now,

00:19:31.476 --> 00:19:34.351
that money is the most important thing.

00:19:36.017 --> 00:19:37.768
Think of Shiva.

00:19:38.809 --> 00:19:41.017
He never thought of money.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:47.017
He never wanted any money.

00:19:48.809 --> 00:19:51.100
He never wanted to show off himself.

00:19:54.476 --> 00:19:59.643
There is such a difference between Shiva and Shakti.

00:20:01.017 --> 00:20:03.017
In their whole attitude.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:08.434
Because Shiva is absolutely a liberated personality,

00:20:08.643 --> 00:20:10.434
he's not bothered.

00:20:12.017 --> 00:20:13.476
If the people

00:20:13.684 --> 00:20:16.975
are indulging into wrong things, he'll destroy - finished!

00:20:19.351 --> 00:20:20.768
He doesn't want to cure,

00:20:20.975 --> 00:20:23.351
He doesn't want to improve, nothing of the kind.

00:20:23.768 --> 00:20:26.768
But for the Shakti it is important,

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:31.768
because this is Her child, this universe is Her child.

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:34.934
All this is created by Her,

00:20:34.975 --> 00:20:37.601
so naturally She is worried

00:20:37.975 --> 00:20:40.142
and She doesn't like people

00:20:40.434 --> 00:20:44.643
who try to take to mean things and nonsense.

00:20:48.017 --> 00:20:54.768
First of all it was human beings started indulging in power.

00:20:55.850 --> 00:21:00.934
They moved from countries to country to empower themselves.

00:21:00.975 --> 00:21:03.100
Where is that power gone? Finished.

00:21:05.518 --> 00:21:10.226
Then, after that, what happened with them

00:21:10.518 --> 00:21:15.518
is that they left their style with others.

00:21:17.934 --> 00:21:19.934
And now it seems

00:21:19.975 --> 00:21:24.643
it is very common to see people shamelessly being greedy.

00:21:28.809 --> 00:21:33.351
For them, is the solution, is Shiva.

00:21:34.809 --> 00:21:37.142
All such people will be destroyed. First of all

00:21:37.518 --> 00:21:43.518
they will be exposed and then they will be destroyed,

00:21:43.934 --> 00:21:46.351
to the last bit of it.

00:21:48.809 --> 00:21:51.142
Another thing is that

00:21:52.518 --> 00:21:58.267
Shiva respects a person who has a good character;

00:21:58.643 --> 00:22:01.643
a person with a good character.

00:22:03.017 --> 00:22:07.142
And if anyone is bad charactered

00:22:08.934 --> 00:22:16.267
or indulges into bad things, Shiva won't spare them.

00:22:17.643 --> 00:22:24.850
So the Shakti creates, protects, looks after them, brings them up.

00:22:25.267 --> 00:22:29.518
But Shiva is sitting there, just to destroy!

00:22:30.934 --> 00:22:36.518
Very important, this destruction is very important.

00:22:36.934 --> 00:22:39.934
The Shakti doesn't show those qualities.

00:22:39.975 --> 00:22:42.142
She may destroy some rakshasas,

00:22:42.518 --> 00:22:45.975
but He can destroy nations after nations.

00:22:47.434 --> 00:22:54.934
First of all the ego you have - who will destroy that?

00:22:55.017 --> 00:23:01.267
, Shiva. Shiva is in your Sahasrara.

00:23:01.684 --> 00:23:03.934
He is sitting in the Sahasrara;

00:23:04.017 --> 00:23:07.518
now remember, on top of everything.

00:23:09.684 --> 00:23:21.100
The other day I saw one gentleman from the Broadcasting, a newsman,

00:23:21.142 --> 00:23:28.100
who was very, very stupid and was talking, very harshly.

00:23:29.684 --> 00:23:35.434
And I saw his Ekadesha Rudra "My God" I said,

00:23:36.267 --> 00:23:40.267
"This one is now going to be in trouble. "

00:23:40.684 --> 00:23:45.934
What is Ekadesha is nothing but the eleven powers of Shiva.

00:23:46.017 --> 00:23:49.309
They build up here

00:23:49.684 --> 00:23:52.476
and give you all kinds of diseases;

00:23:52.643 --> 00:23:55.809
the worst of all is cancer.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:24:00.684
And I knew that this fellow is going to have a very bad time.

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.975
He is not a Sahaja Yogi, how am I to tell him?

00:24:05.017 --> 00:24:07.017
How anybody has to tell him?

00:24:08.434 --> 00:24:11.850
But it comes from this Ekadesha Rudra.

00:24:12.309 --> 00:24:17.434
Now these are eleven powers of Shiva, very well described.

00:24:17.809 --> 00:24:21.975
Now these powers start working on people,

00:24:22.017 --> 00:24:24.017
even on Sahaja Yogis,

00:24:24.809 --> 00:24:29.684
if they do not follow the principle of Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:34.975
He is, I should say, watching everything.

00:24:36.017 --> 00:24:39.100
Every part of your life He watches.

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:46.142
How you behave, what you do, what is your dharma

00:24:46.601 --> 00:24:48.434
- He watches all that.

00:24:48.809 --> 00:24:52.809
And so many saints have warned you,

00:24:52.934 --> 00:24:56.142
so many incarnations have warned you;

00:24:56.601 --> 00:25:00.267
but I tell you if don't listen to them,

00:25:00.518 --> 00:25:04.017
then Shiva is not going to listen.

00:25:04.434 --> 00:25:06.684
He doesn't listen to anyone.

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:10.684
If he's angry, he's angry.

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:15.184
Whatever it is, very difficult to convince Him

00:25:15.601 --> 00:25:20.726
that 'Please spare this person, it's alright. Forgive.

00:25:21.309 --> 00:25:23.934
' But his basic quality is forgiveness,

00:25:24.309 --> 00:25:28.309
can you imagine? His basic quality is forgiveness.

00:25:28.684 --> 00:25:34.684
But if He doesn't forgive, then you are finished.

00:25:36.684 --> 00:25:41.184
Up to a point maybe He might forgive, but after that..

00:25:41.601 --> 00:25:45.975
It's a very, very difficult situation.

00:25:46.017 --> 00:25:50.975
And I find that people don't realise

00:25:51.017 --> 00:25:53.601
what Shiva is.

00:25:54.975 --> 00:25:58.518
In the south we have two types of people worshipers.

00:25:58.684 --> 00:26:01.309
One are shaivaites, another vaishnavaites.

00:26:02.684 --> 00:26:05.017
They are having a big fight between them.

00:26:05.476 --> 00:26:07.184
Now it is less, much less.

00:26:07.601 --> 00:26:13.476
What is the work of Vishnu is to give you realisation,

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:17.601
emancipation of human beings, evolution of human beings.

00:26:18.975 --> 00:26:27.100
But if you fail in your goodness, in your dharma,

00:26:27.184 --> 00:26:32.768
then Shiva comes in your life.

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.476
We have to understand

00:26:36.684 --> 00:26:40.476
that we are all surrounded by their powers,

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:43.601
we are all made by their powers,

00:26:44.975 --> 00:26:48.975
is the Shakti who is protecting you.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:55.601
But to an extent. She cannot go above Shiva,

00:26:58.017 --> 00:27:00.184
She cannot cross Him.

00:27:02.768 --> 00:27:08.601
These days you find so many people indulging into politics

00:27:09.017 --> 00:27:11.184
- it's all money-making propositions.

00:27:12.601 --> 00:27:17.100
They all try to make money, it's not politics!

00:27:17.184 --> 00:27:22.184
They don't do any good to the whole communities, nowhere

00:27:22.601 --> 00:27:26.850
- either under fear or under abandonment.

00:27:26.934 --> 00:27:34.184
They behave in such a manner that they are not afraid of God,

00:27:34.601 --> 00:27:41.184
they are not afraid of His own attention on them.

00:27:42.601 --> 00:27:47.100
Perhaps they don't know that they are under the attention of Shiva.

00:27:48.975 --> 00:27:50.975
He's watching each and every person,

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:57.643
whether you are Australian, English or Indian.

00:27:59.017 --> 00:28:05.100
Whatever religion you may follow, He's watching them.

00:28:05.768 --> 00:28:08.975
This is a thing one has to understand.

00:28:10.351 --> 00:28:12.351
And once you understand this,

00:28:13.768 --> 00:28:19.017
you will accept that you have to be good and dharmic people.

00:28:19.476 --> 00:28:21.975
You have to be good character people.

00:28:23.351 --> 00:28:26.643
Why people talk of good character?

00:28:27.017 --> 00:28:28.975
Try to understand!

00:28:29.351 --> 00:28:33.351
It's stupidity these days when people don't believe in it.

00:28:35.768 --> 00:28:37.768
People are doing all kinds of things,

00:28:37.809 --> 00:28:47.934
they are drinking, they are playing this...money business.

00:28:48.351 --> 00:28:50.476
All kinds of things they are doing

00:28:50.768 --> 00:28:59.768
without having any fear of the wrath of God.

00:29:00.934 --> 00:29:02.975
And that wrath comes from Shiva.

00:29:04.351 --> 00:29:05.975
I would like to warn you all,

00:29:06.351 --> 00:29:09.267
though you are all my children - be careful!

00:29:10.643 --> 00:29:13.100
Try to weigh every step that you take.

00:29:15.518 --> 00:29:17.850
Of course I am there to support you, to help you,

00:29:18.059 --> 00:29:18.975
to protect you.

00:29:19.351 --> 00:29:22.518
But, not beyond Shiva,

00:29:23.934 --> 00:29:25.518
I can't go beyond Him.

00:29:26.934 --> 00:29:35.768
It's such a power of Shiva, it's such an authority of Shiva.

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:41.267
And to worship Him means to worship goodness in Him.

00:29:43.518 --> 00:29:48.934
The goodness could be compassion, could be love,

00:29:48.975 --> 00:29:51.768
could be forgiveness, anything.

00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:53.975
He likes only good people,

00:29:54.351 --> 00:29:56.975
and He will protect only good people.

00:29:57.351 --> 00:30:02.142
For example, some people are very power oriented,

00:30:02.518 --> 00:30:07.017
some are money oriented and some are power oriented.

00:30:07.142 --> 00:30:11.351
And the power oriented also do it for money sometimes,

00:30:11.809 --> 00:30:13.351
that's the aim.

00:30:13.809 --> 00:30:16.643
They'll not stay in Sahaj.

00:30:17.017 --> 00:30:19.643
They will be displaced.

00:30:20.017 --> 00:30:21.850
They do it, and then come and ask for forgiveness,

00:30:22.267 --> 00:30:25.142
"Oh Mother forgive us, we have done it".

00:30:25.518 --> 00:30:28.975
But try not to do anything of that kind.

00:30:29.142 --> 00:30:34.975
I, of course, forgive you, but Shiva, He won't, He won't.

00:30:37.434 --> 00:30:38.934
He will take you to task

00:30:38.975 --> 00:30:40.184
and then you will come to Me "Mother,

00:30:40.476 --> 00:30:42.850
You must save us!" It's very difficult.

00:30:43.267 --> 00:30:46.934
From His clutches it is very difficult.

00:30:46.975 --> 00:30:50.267
Also He's a very forgiving person.

00:30:50.643 --> 00:30:53.934
He forgives you, many things.

00:30:54.017 --> 00:30:57.142
Because of Me also He forgives.

00:30:57.518 --> 00:31:00.643
But, after some time when He takes over,

00:31:01.934 --> 00:31:05.267
there's no appeal, there's no safety.

00:31:05.684 --> 00:31:08.267
I do not want to frighten you,

00:31:08.684 --> 00:31:12.017
but I want to tell you the truth, it is the truth.

00:31:12.434 --> 00:31:15.684
You have to try to be good people.

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:22.850
You have to try to be really good character people.

00:31:23.267 --> 00:31:27.142
I am told some people who are in Sahaja Yoga

00:31:27.518 --> 00:31:33.142
indulge in money laundering and all that.

00:31:33.934 --> 00:31:36.850
Also some of them have very bad characters,

00:31:37.309 --> 00:31:39.267
they run after girls

00:31:39.601 --> 00:31:44.100
and they try to look at the girls and all sorts of things.

00:31:44.142 --> 00:31:49.017
Now this has ruined the west especially.

00:31:49.434 --> 00:31:52.809
Also our Indians are learning from it.

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:58.809
As it is, we have to respect ourselves.

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:05.142
If we don't respect ourselves, and we try to misbehave,

00:32:08.975 --> 00:32:13.518
I can only help you with your Kundalini.

00:32:15.309 --> 00:32:19.809
But if you go too much beyond it,

00:32:19.934 --> 00:32:23.309
Ekadesha Rudra will catch, no doubt.

00:32:25.809 --> 00:32:30.975
It's a very big barrier on your forehead.

00:32:32.017 --> 00:32:40.934
Eka-desha Rudra, and it is so effective nowadays, so much active.

00:32:41.309 --> 00:32:45.726
All kinds of diseases which are coming out, is all incurable,

00:32:46.059 --> 00:32:48.142
are because of Ekadesha.

00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:57.809
And also those who are suffering from possessions.

00:32:59.809 --> 00:33:03.434
The other day I met somebody who was very much caught-up.

00:33:05.809 --> 00:33:09.017
And the Ekadesha was working.

00:33:09.434 --> 00:33:14.892
I found out that he is very fanatically

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:19.809
influenced by something.

00:33:21.809 --> 00:33:24.100
I don't want to name it,

00:33:24.434 --> 00:33:30.434
but these, we have found out, are not correct things.

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:33.892
In every religion we have

00:33:34.184 --> 00:33:38.184
people who are spreading nonsensical ideas.

00:33:38.601 --> 00:33:42.100
Now if you don't have discretion about it,

00:33:42.184 --> 00:33:44.017
nobody can help you.

00:33:44.434 --> 00:33:47.017
You should have a full discretion

00:33:47.434 --> 00:33:53.100
as to what is right and what is wrong.

00:33:56.184 --> 00:33:59.601
Then Shiva is with you.

00:33:59.975 --> 00:34:02.392
But if you indulge

00:34:02.684 --> 00:34:09.975
into all such nonsensical things, it is self-destructive, I must say

00:34:10.017 --> 00:34:15.309
But to the Self which is destructive is the power of Shiva.

00:34:16.684 --> 00:34:21.309
What we call the Self here, is the power of Shiva.

00:34:23.684 --> 00:34:27.309
He destroys by many ways, by many ways.

00:34:29.684 --> 00:34:32.184
You can lose your reputation,

00:34:32.601 --> 00:34:35.184
you can lose your health,

00:34:36.601 --> 00:34:39.601
you can lose your wealth,

00:34:41.017 --> 00:34:42.975
everything can happen to you

00:34:43.184 --> 00:34:47.100
till you are completely finished and that

00:34:51.975 --> 00:34:54.684
I have known people on the death-bed also,

00:34:54.975 --> 00:34:57.975
start talking about money,

00:34:58.017 --> 00:35:01.059
'What should she get, money, how will he get money,

00:35:01.392 --> 00:35:02.476
and this and that'.

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:05.892
Instead of talking about God

00:35:06.184 --> 00:35:09.684
or Self Realisation, they are talking like this.

00:35:11.476 --> 00:35:13.934
It's such a noble thing.

00:35:14.975 --> 00:35:20.309
But if you see Shiva, He doesn't possess anything,

00:35:20.768 --> 00:35:22.601
He doesn't want anything.

00:35:24.975 --> 00:35:26.850
Whatever you give to him,

00:35:26.934 --> 00:35:29.601
as a samarpana or anything,

00:35:29.975 --> 00:35:37.476
that He doesn't accept, and He passes on to the Shakti,

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:39.850
"You do whatever you want to do. "

00:35:39.934 --> 00:35:44.768
She's the one who is working out everything

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:51.184
to benefit you to make you happy. He's not bothered.

00:35:51.601 --> 00:35:55.601
In this case, you have to please Shiva!

00:35:56.017 --> 00:35:58.476
He will not try to please you,

00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:01.850
you have to go all the way to please Him.

00:36:01.934 --> 00:36:06.601
It is a very difficult personality of Shiva.

00:36:09.017 --> 00:36:14.184
In the Koran, it is not written separately

00:36:14.392 --> 00:36:21.100
for Allah or for Shiva, it is not differentiated.

00:36:21.809 --> 00:36:25.017
Because the people with whom He had to deal

00:36:25.351 --> 00:36:28.017
were all uneducated, stupid people.

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:30.768
So He didn't give all the details that

00:36:30.809 --> 00:36:33.975
God is in different forms.

00:36:34.351 --> 00:36:36.975
So there is only one Allah they know.

00:36:37.351 --> 00:36:41.017
But they don't do anything that

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:45.768
shows the differentiations of their jobs and work.

00:36:47.809 --> 00:36:51.768
It is the Shakti who loves, I agree.

00:36:51.809 --> 00:36:56.643
But She too, can get angry very much.

00:36:59.017 --> 00:37:01.975
And once She gets angry, there is no end to it!

00:37:05.351 --> 00:37:08.184
Now I have to tell you, as Sahaja Yogis,

00:37:08.643 --> 00:37:13.100
that you develop your qualities to please the Shiva.

00:37:16.476 --> 00:37:23.768
It's too much of hankering, too much of 'wants'.

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:29.975
All this is not necessary.

00:37:30.351 --> 00:37:34.643
Of course I want you to live well, and beautifully,

00:37:34.809 --> 00:37:38.267
not stupidly - to go into jungles

00:37:38.643 --> 00:37:41.768
or to behave like hippies - that's not the point.

00:37:41.809 --> 00:37:43.643
The point is,

00:37:44.017 --> 00:37:52.643
from your heart, the attachment to things must go away.

00:37:53.017 --> 00:37:57.476
A person who is a Shiva Bhakti

00:38:00.934 --> 00:38:03.643
- he doesn't care for money, he doesn't know about money.

00:38:04.518 --> 00:38:09.934
He is a very generous person, extremely. He's just generous.

00:38:09.975 --> 00:38:15.017
People may say, "Stupid"- the way he goes on, the way he works it.

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:18.267
But I don't think so.

00:38:18.643 --> 00:38:26.975
That's not at all the description.

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:33.768
The description of a man

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:41.100
who is a bhakta of Shiva has no interest in money,

00:38:41.518 --> 00:38:43.518
is very generous.

00:38:43.934 --> 00:38:47.975
Anything you ask from that, he'll give.

00:38:48.351 --> 00:38:50.809
Mahavira's was like that.

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:57.017
Mahavira had gone for his meditation in his own garden

00:38:58.267 --> 00:39:05.518
and Vishnu as Shri Krishna

00:39:05.934 --> 00:39:07.351
came and told him that,

00:39:07.809 --> 00:39:09.643
"See, I have no clothes.

00:39:10.017 --> 00:39:14.643
You have got this cloth, why don't you give me half of it?"

00:39:15.017 --> 00:39:21.934
He said, "All right, you can have it. You can have the whole. "

00:39:23.017 --> 00:39:29.142
Because he said this, "My house is here, I'll just wear my clothes"

00:39:29.518 --> 00:39:31.643
What he did was not

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:36.934
to show that nudity is a very great thing.

00:39:36.975 --> 00:39:39.434
But if you see the Jains, what to do,

00:39:39.809 --> 00:39:47.934
they make big, big statues of Mahavira

00:39:48.142 --> 00:39:50.934
showing Him completely nude.

00:39:50.975 --> 00:39:54.100
I mean, this is the perversion of human mind.

00:39:55.142 --> 00:39:57.100
Why He did it, we should know.

00:39:57.142 --> 00:40:00.267
He was so detached, so detached, to

00:40:00.643 --> 00:40:04.017
give away the clothes, what is the harm?

00:40:04.434 --> 00:40:06.934
It was not to show-off or anything.

00:40:07.017 --> 00:40:12.684
But the generosity, people don't understand.

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:16.434
And the Jainies are the least generous!

00:40:19.142 --> 00:40:25.850
So the quality of all these great incarnations is also not understood.

00:40:26.267 --> 00:40:34.434
Because a kind of an illusion is there.

00:40:34.809 --> 00:40:41.850
For example, Shiva is always with very few clothes, very few.

00:40:44.267 --> 00:40:48.434
And what does he eat? No-one knows.

00:40:49.809 --> 00:40:54.684
What is his desires and what does he want? No-one knows.

00:40:56.100 --> 00:41:00.934
A person with a great knowledge of music will sing before him,

00:41:01.017 --> 00:41:02.100
He's alright.

00:41:02.142 --> 00:41:05.850
Or even any madcap comes and sings, He's alright.

00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:10.850
For Him it doesn't matter,

00:41:11.309 --> 00:41:16.850
He's not meticulous about how the music is and what the notes are,

00:41:17.309 --> 00:41:20.434
whether it is alright or not, no.

00:41:20.809 --> 00:41:23.100
He is beyond all these things.

00:41:23.142 --> 00:41:27.684
He is beyond all these formalities that we have about everything,

00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:30.934
he is beyond.

00:41:31.309 --> 00:41:36.601
He is spirituality itself, he is beyond all these things.

00:41:36.975 --> 00:41:42.267
Whether you are a musician or you are an artist,

00:41:42.601 --> 00:41:47.601
whatever it is you are, He'll enjoy.

00:41:47.975 --> 00:41:52.017
He's the enjoyer, and He'll enjoy -

00:41:52.434 --> 00:41:58.434
whatever is simple, whatever is given with the heart, He'll enjoy.

00:41:58.809 --> 00:42:01.809
Whatever is expressed with the heart, He'll enjoy.

00:42:01.934 --> 00:42:06.142
He is not a conditioned person,

00:42:06.601 --> 00:42:11.017
that it should be modern, it should be such and such.

00:42:11.434 --> 00:42:12.975
He is not conditioned.

00:42:13.017 --> 00:42:17.975
He doesn't think that way like human beings who will sit down

00:42:18.017 --> 00:42:23.184
and make a meticulous everything, does it fit into it or not.

00:42:23.601 --> 00:42:27.100
Even, even for art,

00:42:27.184 --> 00:42:32.975
even for anything that is created out of somebody's heart,

00:42:33.017 --> 00:42:36.434
they will try to discourage that person.

00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:42.184
I have seen people, they have such conditioning.

00:42:42.601 --> 00:42:45.975
And one thing about Shiva, he has no

00:42:46.017 --> 00:42:49.601
conditioning of anything, nothing.

00:42:50.184 --> 00:42:53.100
That's why they call him a mast-maulaa

00:42:53.184 --> 00:42:56.017
- He is not at all conditioned.

00:42:56.476 --> 00:42:59.017
If you have any conditioning in your mind,

00:42:59.226 --> 00:43:01.017
then you are not a Shivabhakta.

00:43:01.476 --> 00:43:04.601
It's all right, you should dress up well, you should do this …

00:43:04.975 --> 00:43:08.601
but you should not have conditioning that 'If you don't do that

00:43:08.975 --> 00:43:17.017
you are being out of cast, out of fashion, out of this …'.

00:43:18.476 --> 00:43:23.476
It is very difficult for people not to accept.

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:28.184
All kinds of fashions are coming nowadays, all kinds.

00:43:28.601 --> 00:43:32.100
I tell them, "What is this?" "Oh this is the fashion. "

00:43:32.184 --> 00:43:35.309
Is it some God behind this fashion,

00:43:35.768 --> 00:43:38.934
or is there some deity who is telling you these fashions?

00:43:39.309 --> 00:43:41.768
Today it comes, tomorrow it will disappear.

00:43:42.934 --> 00:43:44.850
So, what I am saying,

00:43:44.934 --> 00:43:49.100
that if you have to worship Shiva,

00:43:49.184 --> 00:43:52.100
you should de-condition yourself.

00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:55.934
You are living in the world of Sahasrara.

00:43:56.768 --> 00:44:01.100
Now, somebody is not properly dressed - finished!

00:44:01.184 --> 00:44:04.768
Somebody is over-popularly dressed - finished!

00:44:04.934 --> 00:44:09.768
Human beings have a capacity to criticise everyone.

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:15.351
And to criticise everyone, this is nothing fundamental

00:44:15.768 --> 00:44:19.184
because if you do it on vibrations, one can understand.

00:44:19.601 --> 00:44:21.768
But not on vibrations, just

00:44:21.809 --> 00:44:27.184
because 'this is not the fashion, that is not the fashion'.

00:44:28.601 --> 00:44:32.100
What is the fashion of Shiva, tell me.

00:44:32.476 --> 00:44:34.601
Has He any fashions?

00:44:36.017 --> 00:44:38.351
Anything you give Him, He's happy.

00:44:38.768 --> 00:44:41.351
Whatever you give Him, He eats that.

00:44:41.768 --> 00:44:50.351
He is full of such appreciation because He is personified as Joy.

00:44:51.017 --> 00:44:53.809
He is peace and He is joy.

00:44:54.184 --> 00:44:57.850
If you are worshippers of Shiva,

00:44:57.975 --> 00:45:04.351
then you should not have any conditioning of any kind.

00:45:07.184 --> 00:45:11.351
I mean, normally I also wear simple saris, very simple.

00:45:11.768 --> 00:45:16.476
And it happens that people think I am a very poor woman.

00:45:16.850 --> 00:45:18.476
I am poor

00:45:19.934 --> 00:45:24.975
because I don't care for money, I don't bother.

00:45:25.351 --> 00:45:34.975
So, we should know that Shiva is the poorest man, purest God.

00:45:35.351 --> 00:45:40.934
He doesn't wear any alankaras, he doesn't wear anything, just

00:45:41.975 --> 00:45:44.975
he lives with his own body.

00:45:45.351 --> 00:45:51.809
Because he is nothing but embodiment of enjoyment,

00:45:52.267 --> 00:46:00.643
nothing but complete form of enjoyment and joy.

00:46:02.017 --> 00:46:06.643
So another quality of Shivabhakta* should be joy.

00:46:07.975 --> 00:46:11.643
You should be joyous about everything

00:46:12.017 --> 00:46:16.768
- whatever you see, whatever type of person you see.

00:46:16.975 --> 00:46:19.100
So the only way you can do, is

00:46:19.518 --> 00:46:23.351
give up human quality of criticism

00:46:26.267 --> 00:46:28.518
- to criticise others.

00:46:28.934 --> 00:46:32.100
Like if the English go into the Indian house,

00:46:32.518 --> 00:46:33.768
they say "We don't like it. "

00:46:33.850 --> 00:46:35.100
"Yes, what, what you don't like?"

00:46:35.518 --> 00:46:38.100
"We didn't like the carpet. "

00:46:38.518 --> 00:46:44.351
'I don't like it' itself is against your Shakti.

00:46:44.809 --> 00:46:48.809
Then, if supposing an American goes to an English home,

00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:51.934
he'll say, "I don't like it. " It's very common.

00:46:51.975 --> 00:46:55.518
All the people say "I don't like it", "I didn't like that".

00:46:55.934 --> 00:46:57.643
Who are you

00:46:58.017 --> 00:47:01.267
to say 'I don't like it' or 'I like it'.

00:47:01.643 --> 00:47:06.017
People don't realise that by saying all these things,

00:47:06.142 --> 00:47:10.643
you are showing that there is no Shiva principle in you.

00:47:14.017 --> 00:47:17.850
I can understand somebody who cannot walk, alright,

00:47:18.267 --> 00:47:23.934
for such a person is allowed to use some sticks or something,

00:47:23.975 --> 00:47:25.975
allowed.

00:47:26.434 --> 00:47:27.934
But if he says "I don't like that person

00:47:28.142 --> 00:47:30.518
because he doesn't use the stick.",

00:47:30.934 --> 00:47:34.809
shows that he is such an egoistical fellow;

00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:38.850
himself is using the stick and

00:47:39.184 --> 00:47:42.351
he wants to create what, warns or what,

00:47:42.559 --> 00:47:45.267
in a democratic country, that people should

00:47:45.559 --> 00:47:50.267
walk with the sticks in their hands. It is very difficult.

00:47:50.643 --> 00:47:53.518
In the west it is very common, you see,

00:47:53.934 --> 00:47:55.850
to have this kind of a hat,

00:47:56.267 --> 00:47:59.100
to have this kind of a dress,

00:47:59.142 --> 00:48:01.017
to wear this kind of a cheroot.

00:48:01.309 --> 00:48:04.934
All kinds of things have a conditioning.

00:48:06.017 --> 00:48:11.434
Nowadays the hairstyle has become very funny with women.

00:48:11.809 --> 00:48:15.100
Because they don't put oil in their hair.

00:48:16.142 --> 00:48:22.017
They will not have any grease in their hair.

00:48:22.434 --> 00:48:25.809
If somebody's going to meet them they will wash their hair.

00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:29.100
I don't think it looks very nice.

00:48:29.142 --> 00:48:30.434
Of course I don't say that

00:48:30.809 --> 00:48:35.684
you need not have so much of oil on your face and ears.

00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:39.142
But, what is so important?

00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:51.017
In life, is also this is another thing that we are very self-centred.

00:48:52.518 --> 00:48:54.809
We want to impress people.

00:48:56.309 --> 00:49:03.100
If I wear a dress or anything, it should impress.

00:49:04.142 --> 00:49:07.809
I mean, even it impresses - what?

00:49:08.850 --> 00:49:12.850
If a snake comes along, he will bit you, whatever dress

00:49:13.684 --> 00:49:17.309
you might be wearing, whatever country you might be from.

00:49:17.684 --> 00:49:25.434
All this kind of identification, it doesn't behove a Shivabhakta.

00:49:27.809 --> 00:49:30.434
A Shivabhakta has to be just

00:49:30.809 --> 00:49:35.434
absolutely lost in the raptures of joy.

00:49:37.601 --> 00:49:43.017
Very particular about hairdress, very particular about dresses

00:49:43.226 --> 00:49:45.975
- I don't know what they are particular about.

00:49:46.017 --> 00:49:50.017
With all that, what do they gain? Nothing.

00:49:51.434 --> 00:49:53.476
Do they become popular?

00:49:54.267 --> 00:49:56.768
And this kind of popularity,

00:49:57.100 --> 00:50:00.601
which is so skin-deep, what's the use?

00:50:01.975 --> 00:50:06.601
You must have respect, respect of your being.

00:50:06.975 --> 00:50:12.850
As not only human beings, but as Sahaja Yogis.

00:50:13.934 --> 00:50:15.975
You are Sahaja Yogis.

00:50:16.017 --> 00:50:21.684
We are Shiva's bhaktas, we don't care.

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:24.684
We are not bothered.

00:50:26.017 --> 00:50:30.934
Whatever it is, Shiva is there within us

00:50:31.184 --> 00:50:41.017
and we shine with that power within us that is of Kundalini.

00:50:43.184 --> 00:50:45.934
You may be very well dressed, you may be anything.

00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:48.601
If your vibrations are bad, what's the use?

00:50:49.975 --> 00:50:51.768
If you cannot judge people

00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:54.768
by their vibrations,by nonsensical things

00:50:55.100 --> 00:51:00.392
like their dress and moustaches, is it of any value?

00:51:00.684 --> 00:51:06.017
In Sahaja Yoga your value system has to be Sahaj.

00:51:08.476 --> 00:51:10.684
I have seen many people,

00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:13.975
"I don't like their house, I didn't like this …"

00:51:14.017 --> 00:51:19.684
'I don't like' is the sentence, is nishidda,

00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:23.476
is to be given up by Sahaja Yogis.

00:51:26.850 --> 00:51:29.184
If you don't like anything, you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:39.309
Now, of course, I mean, if there is somebody who is anti-Sahaj and all that,

00:51:39.768 --> 00:51:44.184
but still by saying 'I don't like', what are you going to gain?

00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:47.975
It's a waste of energy.

00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:57.100
Because of this, in Sahaja Yoga I have seen,

00:51:57.184 --> 00:52:01.309
people have created problems for Me, so many problems.

00:52:01.768 --> 00:52:06.184
Only because they are such much 'self' oriented.

00:52:08.601 --> 00:52:12.601
"This man is bad, that woman is bad, he is this, that …"

00:52:12.975 --> 00:52:14.309
Sometimes I am surprised.

00:52:14.601 --> 00:52:17.601
Because when those people come to me,

00:52:17.934 --> 00:52:21.184
I am amazed that they are very nice people.

00:52:22.601 --> 00:52:26.100
But people are very self-centred, also.

00:52:26.392 --> 00:52:31.184
Like I have seen people who are not bothered

00:52:31.601 --> 00:52:38.476
to come to meetings, to pujas.

00:52:39.850 --> 00:52:42.017
Because they have got work.

00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:50.100
Altogether there are eleven pujas, but they don't come.

00:52:52.476 --> 00:52:55.100
Because they are very busy.

00:52:56.476 --> 00:52:58.768
At least to one puja you should come.

00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:08.476
But those who are Shivabhaktas only enjoy nothing but pujas.

00:53:09.017 --> 00:53:11.017
Nothing else

00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:18.351
Their whole being is absolutely vibrated by Shiva bhakti.

00:53:18.768 --> 00:53:21.476
To them, that's the most important thing to do.

00:53:22.850 --> 00:53:25.768
Also there are people in Sahaja Yoga

00:53:25.809 --> 00:53:29.100
who are trying to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:29.476 --> 00:53:32.975
Very wrong, very wrong, very wrong.

00:53:34.351 --> 00:53:38.768
Sahaja Yoga is to give you punyas,

00:53:38.809 --> 00:53:41.184
to give you blessings,

00:53:41.643 --> 00:53:44.809
and if that is not in your mind,

00:53:45.267 --> 00:53:46.184
better give up Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:46.434 --> 00:53:49.768
You can join some business or something

00:53:49.809 --> 00:53:52.643
of malpractices very easily, very easily.

00:53:53.017 --> 00:53:55.267
Till you end up in the jail you are there.

00:53:58.643 --> 00:54:04.100
But to enjoy your spiritual powers

00:54:04.476 --> 00:54:07.100
you must learn certain things.

00:54:07.476 --> 00:54:10.975
And one of them is de-condition yourself

00:54:11.351 --> 00:54:14.975
- 'I don't like it' or 'I like it' -

00:54:15.267 --> 00:54:19.518
this sentence must go away from your tongue!

00:54:24.809 --> 00:54:25.934
Likes and dislikes

00:54:25.975 --> 00:54:28.934
are only for people who have limited vision.

00:54:31.975 --> 00:54:35.267
You should learn to appreciate.

00:54:35.643 --> 00:54:37.975
Your power of appreciation will show

00:54:38.351 --> 00:54:41.392
how spiritually you are endowed.

00:54:44.768 --> 00:54:50.267
And your power of observation

00:54:50.559 --> 00:54:52.768
will show what do you observe.

00:54:53.850 --> 00:54:56.643
For example, some people will come and tell me,

00:54:56.850 --> 00:55:01.267
"I didn't like that lady, she was wearing a funny sari. "

00:55:02.643 --> 00:55:04.267
I mean, what is this?

00:55:06.643 --> 00:55:11.850
"I didn't like her, because she was putting her hand on her head".

00:55:12.267 --> 00:55:14.142
So what?

00:55:15.518 --> 00:55:18.351
Because you make your own images of people, and you want

00:55:19.809 --> 00:55:22.809
everybody to be like that, otherwise you don't like it.

00:55:23.267 --> 00:55:26.934
Whether you like it or don't like it, nobody's going to change.

00:55:27.975 --> 00:55:30.267
Why waste your energy?

00:55:32.017 --> 00:55:35.351
Sometimes there are musicians who are not so good.

00:55:42.267 --> 00:55:50.434
I remember, once I went home and I asked my father,

00:55:50.809 --> 00:55:52.850
"How does this musician sing?"

00:55:53.267 --> 00:55:57.100
He says, "He's very courageous, very courageous. "

00:55:57.142 --> 00:55:59.100
I said, "Why, what happened?"

00:55:59.351 --> 00:56:03.934
He said, "He sings without bothering about it

00:56:03.975 --> 00:56:06.392
and he goes out of tune sometimes,

00:56:06.601 --> 00:56:08.809
he goes out of taala, doesn't matter,

00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:10.142
but he sings.

00:56:10.518 --> 00:56:12.267
He's very courageous, himmatwala"

00:56:12.643 --> 00:56:16.809
So, that's how he used to appreciate, I have seen.

00:56:16.850 --> 00:56:22.142
When this fellow started singing, I saw he was like that,

00:56:22.518 --> 00:56:27.518
but my father was saying "Wa-wa, wa-wa" and encouraging him.

00:56:27.934 --> 00:56:31.850
You see, I have seen in my father these divine qualities,

00:56:32.267 --> 00:56:35.142
how he used to tolerate,

00:56:35.518 --> 00:56:39.684
how he used to - I mean not tolerance also, just appreciation.

00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:43.518
Of any kind of thing he used to appreciate.

00:56:43.684 --> 00:56:46.726
That's what, if the Sahaja Yogis have that

00:56:47.017 --> 00:56:52.017
condition of appreciation they will enjoy everything.

00:56:52.226 --> 00:56:55.434
Because you kill your enjoyment, do you know that?

00:56:57.850 --> 00:57:01.434
You are all variety of people here, all variety of dresses,

00:57:01.601 --> 00:57:06.309
all variety of families and so many countries you are here.

00:57:06.684 --> 00:57:10.100
To Me you are nothing but Sahaja Yogis, my children, that's all.

00:57:12.142 --> 00:57:15.601
Now I don't go on judging you on your dress, or

00:57:15.768 --> 00:57:18.684
on what your hairstyle is, no.

00:57:20.142 --> 00:57:23.309
All modern things are extremely conditioning.

00:57:25.309 --> 00:57:31.309
And they condition you so much that you get irresponsible.

00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:34.850
As Sahaja Yogis you get irresponsible.

00:57:35.309 --> 00:57:40.100
Your first and foremost responsibility is Sahaja Yoga.

00:57:40.142 --> 00:57:43.017
Because you should know what a work it is.

00:57:44.434 --> 00:57:50.934
It is such a great work, to transform the whole world - that is My vision.

00:57:51.309 --> 00:57:54.601
And this old age I think the same.

00:57:54.975 --> 00:57:59.309
Now, if that is My vision, what should be your attitude?

00:57:59.684 --> 00:58:03.934
That we should go all out to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:06.017
That's the main thing.

00:58:06.434 --> 00:58:13.601
I call you for these pujas just to renovate, I should say,

00:58:13.975 --> 00:58:17.309
to give you more of energy and all that.

00:58:17.684 --> 00:58:20.518
But if you are just taking it as a great

00:58:20.768 --> 00:58:23.768
blessings and sitting at home it's of no use.

00:58:24.934 --> 00:58:26.850
You must spread Sahaja Yoga!

00:58:26.934 --> 00:58:30.100
I was surprised that they said

00:58:30.392 --> 00:58:36.601
in Lucknow there are only 200 Sahaja Yogis. How can that be?

00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:39.100
First time I went to Lucknow,

00:58:39.309 --> 00:58:41.684
there were at least three thousand Sahaja Yogis

00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:45.184
and we had not fixed any hall or anything.

00:58:45.601 --> 00:58:49.684
And can you imagine, suddenly I find so many people.

00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:53.975
How is it there can be two hundred Sahaja Yogis?

00:58:54.017 --> 00:58:59.184
Either you are telling lies, or you are good for nothing.

00:59:00.601 --> 00:59:03.601
So the responsibility of all the Sahaja Yogis,

00:59:03.850 --> 00:59:08.934
of all the Sahaja Yogis, first and foremost,

00:59:09.309 --> 00:59:11.100
is to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:59:12.184 --> 00:59:14.309
How many people have you given realisation?

00:59:15.684 --> 00:59:17.934
Where have you talked about Sahaja Yoga?

00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:21.684
I have seen even in the plane, if you are travelling,

00:59:21.975 --> 00:59:26.726
anyone who is there will tell Me "My guru is this,

00:59:27.017 --> 00:59:29.684
you know, such a great guru, this that. "

00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:33.476
Openly, shamelessly, about horrible gurus!

00:59:34.059 --> 00:59:40.975
While you people are very shy to talk about Sahaja Yoga.

00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:45.184
Never publicly unless and until

00:59:45.601 --> 00:59:49.975
you have a programme, and public programme and all that.

00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:56.975
You have no time, also, for Sahaja Yoga, very busy people.

01:00:01.476 --> 01:00:08.726
So, if you have to follow Shiva and His blessings all the time,

01:00:08.934 --> 01:00:10.476
His protection to you...

01:00:10.768 --> 01:00:18.184
then you have to be Sahaja Yogis of very high quality.

01:00:20.601 --> 01:00:23.601
It shows when you go all out

01:00:24.017 --> 01:00:25.934
to spread Sahaja Yoga.

01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:31.184
That is the thing missing.

01:00:31.601 --> 01:00:34.476
I am very happy that in Australia

01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:37.184
Sahaja Yoga has spread so much.

01:00:37.601 --> 01:00:40.934
I don't know what has happened.

01:00:41.351 --> 01:00:44.850
In a far fetched place like Australia.

01:00:45.768 --> 01:00:49.017
In the beginning I had some set-backs

01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:53.892
but now it has spread. Also in Austria it has spread.

01:00:54.059 --> 01:00:56.768
And also in Italy.

01:00:58.850 --> 01:01:03.850
But otherwise, just doesn't spread. What's the matter?

01:01:03.975 --> 01:01:07.809
The matter is the leaders are not going all-out.

01:01:08.184 --> 01:01:12.100
Say, for in England I travelled from north to south,

01:01:12.476 --> 01:01:15.017
east to west in all the directions.

01:01:17.768 --> 01:01:23.184
We have very poor, very poor Sahaja Yogis there.

01:01:23.643 --> 01:01:28.768
You have to go to universities, to younger people.

01:01:29.850 --> 01:01:35.809
If hippy-ism can spread, why not Sahaja Yoga?

01:01:37.809 --> 01:01:43.351
It spread like wild-fire, why not Sahaja Yoga?

01:01:43.768 --> 01:01:50.351
All these things are there, which I have to warn you - be careful!

01:01:51.768 --> 01:01:55.476
If you have got Realisation, you have a responsibility

01:01:55.934 --> 01:02:01.017
- to give realisation to others, and to spread Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:07.975
If you can't do it, then God save you.

01:02:08.351 --> 01:02:09.768
I have nothing to say.

01:02:11.809 --> 01:02:13.809
You have to introspect,

01:02:14.267 --> 01:02:16.267
'What have I done for Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:17.643 --> 01:02:19.267
What have I got from Sahaja Yoga?'

01:02:21.643 --> 01:02:25.476
And I am sure after this Shiva puja,

01:02:25.726 --> 01:02:30.351
you will dedicate yourself to Shiva principle within you.

01:02:30.643 --> 01:02:34.643
Shiva principle doesn't 'stir out',

01:02:35.017 --> 01:02:43.768
it's very, very stern, it's very powerful.

01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:52.267
You have to dedicate, and you have to surrender.

01:02:52.643 --> 01:02:58.975
Above every other job, above every other performance,

01:02:59.351 --> 01:03:01.267
the highest is this.

01:03:01.643 --> 01:03:09.518
So, with this, I ask Shiva to give you blessings,

01:03:09.934 --> 01:03:11.850
complete blessings,

01:03:12.267 --> 01:03:18.142
so that you get transformed into the personality of Shiva.

01:03:18.518 --> 01:03:19.142
May God bless you all
