00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:03.959
Shivaratri Puja, Pune,
17 March 2002.

00:13:59.969 --> 00:14:09.136
Tonight we have gathered here to do Shri Shiva Puja.

00:14:19.177 --> 00:14:28.218
Those people who have a clean heart can only do Shiva Puja.

00:14:29.719 --> 00:14:37.385
Those whose heart is not clean cannot do Shiva Puja.

00:14:38.677 --> 00:14:44.343
It's a simple principle of Shri Shivaratri.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:01.343
As you have seen yesterday, we have snakes,

00:15:02.385 --> 00:15:06.969
or, these are horrible snakes

00:15:11.677 --> 00:15:16.468
guiding behind the Shiva Linga.

00:15:18.302 --> 00:15:25.802
The significance is this - those who are clean in heart,

00:15:30.218 --> 00:15:33.468
who are full of love for others,

00:15:36.468 --> 00:15:46.302
are always guarded by the power of Shiva,

00:15:46.552 --> 00:15:49.218
which are the snakes.

00:15:50.468 --> 00:15:57.218
It's a symbolic thing, to say, very symbolic.

00:15:58.218 --> 00:16:02.552
But I must say that animals understand

00:16:03.218 --> 00:16:09.385
Divine force much better than human beings, much better.

00:16:10.802 --> 00:16:13.802
Because they have a clean heart.

00:16:16.218 --> 00:16:24.052
Whatever is their lifestyle built by nature,

00:16:24.468 --> 00:16:26.052
they carry on with it.

00:16:26.468 --> 00:16:32.343
But there's no malice, there's no jealousy,

00:16:32.385 --> 00:16:37.385
there's not all these mean things in their heart.

00:16:37.844 --> 00:16:40.844
They do it because it is supposed to be.

00:16:43.218 --> 00:16:48.468
But the quality of human beings is only one

00:16:49.552 --> 00:16:54.844
- and that is how much they love and forgive.

00:16:57.218 --> 00:17:02.677
Loving capacity of human beings are such by

00:17:03.052 --> 00:17:07.218
which they conquer all their negative forces -

00:17:07.302 --> 00:17:11.677
they can, easily, see that it's not good

00:17:12.218 --> 00:17:14.844
to have all these qualities,

00:17:15.218 --> 00:17:19.468
or maybe that they understand it's not noble

00:17:19.552 --> 00:17:25.218
to indulge into all these inhuman behaviour.

00:17:28.302 --> 00:17:34.844
They are not bound to indulge into all these things.

00:17:36.677 --> 00:17:44.218
Neither they are asked to be,

00:17:46.302 --> 00:17:55.136
but suddenly they get lured by such things which has got hatred,

00:17:55.468 --> 00:18:03.468
jealousy and greed.

00:18:06.844 --> 00:18:09.302
You see how Shiva lives.

00:18:10.719 --> 00:18:12.552
He lives in the Himalayas.

00:18:13.969 --> 00:18:18.969
See what clothes He wears, what He eats.

00:18:19.385 --> 00:18:25.552
He has no demand for anything because He's complete, He's perfect.

00:18:28.969 --> 00:18:33.177
Such a personality is Shiva's.

00:18:33.552 --> 00:18:37.385
And if you are worshipping Him,

00:18:37.468 --> 00:18:41.177
you should find out within your heart

00:18:41.719 --> 00:18:51.218
what sort of feelings you have, what sort of malice you nurture.

00:18:51.302 --> 00:18:57.719
These days in India, greed has become the main point.

00:18:59.136 --> 00:19:03.011
They are so mean and so low.

00:19:05.218 --> 00:19:13.343
Which impossible to understand that they think money is everything,

00:19:15.177 --> 00:19:19.218
which is not in the culture of Indians, no, no.

00:19:19.552 --> 00:19:21.218
In no way.

00:19:21.552 --> 00:19:25.136
But somehow they have picked it up,

00:19:25.427 --> 00:19:27.719
in the foreign countries perhaps,

00:19:28.136 --> 00:19:30.552
and it is spreading very much now,

00:19:30.844 --> 00:19:33.719
that money is the most important thing.

00:19:35.385 --> 00:19:37.136
Think of Shiva.

00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:40.385
He never thought of money.

00:19:43.468 --> 00:19:46.385
He never wanted any money.

00:19:48.177 --> 00:19:50.468
He never wanted to show off himself.

00:19:53.844 --> 00:19:59.011
There is such a difference between Shiva and Shakti.

00:20:00.385 --> 00:20:02.385
In their whole attitude.

00:20:02.468 --> 00:20:07.802
Because Shiva is absolutely a liberated personality,

00:20:08.011 --> 00:20:09.802
he's not bothered.

00:20:11.385 --> 00:20:12.844
If the people

00:20:13.052 --> 00:20:16.343
are indulging into wrong things, he'll destroy - finished!

00:20:18.719 --> 00:20:20.136
He doesn't want to cure,

00:20:20.343 --> 00:20:22.719
He doesn't want to improve, nothing of the kind.

00:20:23.136 --> 00:20:26.136
But for the Shakti it is important,

00:20:26.218 --> 00:20:31.136
because this is Her child, this universe is Her child.

00:20:31.218 --> 00:20:34.302
All this is created by Her,

00:20:34.343 --> 00:20:36.969
so naturally She is worried

00:20:37.343 --> 00:20:39.510
and She doesn't like people

00:20:39.802 --> 00:20:44.011
who try to take to mean things and nonsense.

00:20:47.385 --> 00:20:54.136
First of all it was human beings started indulging in power.

00:20:55.218 --> 00:21:00.302
They moved from countries to country to empower themselves.

00:21:00.343 --> 00:21:02.468
Where is that power gone? Finished.

00:21:04.886 --> 00:21:09.594
Then, after that, what happened with them

00:21:09.886 --> 00:21:14.886
is that they left their style with others.

00:21:17.302 --> 00:21:19.302
And now it seems

00:21:19.343 --> 00:21:24.011
it is very common to see people shamelessly being greedy.

00:21:28.177 --> 00:21:32.719
For them, is the solution, is Shiva.

00:21:34.177 --> 00:21:36.510
All such people will be destroyed. First of all

00:21:36.886 --> 00:21:42.886
they will be exposed and then they will be destroyed,

00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:45.719
to the last bit of it.

00:21:48.177 --> 00:21:50.510
Another thing is that

00:21:51.886 --> 00:21:57.635
Shiva respects a person who has a good character;

00:21:58.011 --> 00:22:01.011
a person with a good character.

00:22:02.385 --> 00:22:06.510
And if anyone is bad charactered

00:22:08.302 --> 00:22:15.635
or indulges into bad things, Shiva won't spare them.

00:22:17.011 --> 00:22:24.218
So the Shakti creates, protects, looks after them, brings them up.

00:22:24.635 --> 00:22:28.886
But Shiva is sitting there, just to destroy!

00:22:30.302 --> 00:22:35.886
Very important, this destruction is very important.

00:22:36.302 --> 00:22:39.302
The Shakti doesn't show those qualities.

00:22:39.343 --> 00:22:41.510
She may destroy some rakshasas,

00:22:41.886 --> 00:22:45.343
but He can destroy nations after nations.

00:22:46.802 --> 00:22:54.302
First of all the ego you have - who will destroy that?

00:22:54.385 --> 00:23:00.635
, Shiva. Shiva is in your Sahasrara.

00:23:01.052 --> 00:23:03.302
He is sitting in the Sahasrara;

00:23:03.385 --> 00:23:06.886
now remember, on top of everything.

00:23:09.052 --> 00:23:20.468
The other day I saw one gentleman from the Broadcasting, a newsman,

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:27.468
who was very, very stupid and was talking very harshly.

00:23:29.052 --> 00:23:34.802
And I saw his Ekadesha coming up: "My God" I said,

00:23:35.635 --> 00:23:39.635
"This one is now going to be in trouble."

00:23:40.052 --> 00:23:45.302
What is Ekadesha is nothing but the eleven powers of Shiva.

00:23:45.385 --> 00:23:48.677
They build up here

00:23:49.052 --> 00:23:51.844
and give you all kinds of diseases;

00:23:52.011 --> 00:23:55.177
the worst of all is cancer.

00:23:55.218 --> 00:24:00.052
And I knew that this fellow is going to have a very bad time.

00:24:00.468 --> 00:24:04.343
But he is not a Sahaja Yogi, how am I to tell him?

00:24:04.385 --> 00:24:06.385
How anybody has to tell him?

00:24:07.802 --> 00:24:11.218
But it comes from this Ekadesha Rudra.

00:24:11.677 --> 00:24:16.802
Now these are eleven powers of Shiva, very well described.

00:24:17.177 --> 00:24:21.343
Now these powers start working on people,

00:24:21.385 --> 00:24:23.385
even on Sahaja Yogis,

00:24:24.177 --> 00:24:29.052
if they do not follow the principle of Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:30.468 --> 00:24:34.343
He is, I should say, watching everything.

00:24:35.385 --> 00:24:38.468
Every part of your life He watches.

00:24:40.468 --> 00:24:45.510
How you behave, what you do, what is your dharma

00:24:45.969 --> 00:24:47.802
- He watches all that.

00:24:48.177 --> 00:24:52.177
And so many saints have warned you,

00:24:52.302 --> 00:24:55.510
so many incarnations have warned you;

00:24:55.969 --> 00:24:59.635
but I tell you if you don't listen to them,

00:24:59.886 --> 00:25:03.385
then Shiva is not going to listen.

00:25:03.802 --> 00:25:06.052
He doesn't listen to anyone.

00:25:08.468 --> 00:25:10.052
If he's angry, he's angry.

00:25:10.468 --> 00:25:14.552
Whatever it is, very difficult to convince Him

00:25:14.969 --> 00:25:20.094
that 'Please spare this person, it's alright. Forgive.

00:25:20.677 --> 00:25:23.302
' But his basic quality is forgiveness,

00:25:23.677 --> 00:25:27.677
can you imagine? His basic quality is forgiveness.

00:25:28.052 --> 00:25:34.052
But if He doesn't forgive, then you are finished.

00:25:36.052 --> 00:25:40.552
Up to a point maybe He might forgive, but after that..

00:25:40.969 --> 00:25:45.343
It's a very, very difficult situation.

00:25:45.385 --> 00:25:50.343
And I find that people don't realise

00:25:50.385 --> 00:25:52.969
what Shiva is.

00:25:54.343 --> 00:25:57.886
In the south we have two types of people worshipers.

00:25:58.052 --> 00:26:00.677
One are shaivaites, another vaishnavaites.

00:26:02.052 --> 00:26:04.385
They are having a big fight with each other.

00:26:04.844 --> 00:26:06.552
Now it is less, much less.

00:26:06.969 --> 00:26:12.844
What is the work of Vishnu is to give you realisation,

00:26:13.218 --> 00:26:16.969
emancipation of human beings, evolution of human beings.

00:26:18.343 --> 00:26:26.468
But if you fail in your goodness, in your dharma,

00:26:26.552 --> 00:26:32.136
then Shiva comes in your life.

00:26:34.468 --> 00:26:35.844
We have to understand

00:26:36.052 --> 00:26:39.844
[that] we are all surrounded by their powers,

00:26:40.218 --> 00:26:42.969
we are all made by their powers.

00:26:44.343 --> 00:26:48.343
It's the Shakti who is protecting you.

00:26:48.468 --> 00:26:54.969
But to an extent. She cannot go above Shiva,

00:26:57.385 --> 00:26:59.552
She cannot cross Him.

00:27:02.136 --> 00:27:07.969
These days you find so many people indulging into politics

00:27:08.385 --> 00:27:10.552
- it's all money-making propositions.

00:27:11.969 --> 00:27:16.468
They all try to make money, it's not politics!

00:27:16.552 --> 00:27:21.552
They don't do any good to the whole communities, nowhere.

00:27:21.969 --> 00:27:26.218
Either under fear or under abandonment.

00:27:26.302 --> 00:27:33.552
They behave in such a manner that they are not afraid of God,

00:27:33.969 --> 00:27:40.552
they are not afraid of His own attention on people.

00:27:41.969 --> 00:27:46.468
Perhaps they don't know that they are under the attention of Shiva.

00:27:48.343 --> 00:27:50.343
He's watching each and every person,

00:27:52.218 --> 00:27:57.011
whether you are Australian, English or Indian.

00:27:58.385 --> 00:28:04.468
Whatever religion you may follow, He's watching them.

00:28:05.136 --> 00:28:08.343
This is a thing one has to understand.

00:28:09.719 --> 00:28:11.719
And once you understand this,

00:28:13.136 --> 00:28:18.385
you will accept that you have to be good and dharmic people.

00:28:18.844 --> 00:28:21.343
You have to be good-charactered people.

00:28:22.719 --> 00:28:26.011
Why people talk of good character?

00:28:26.385 --> 00:28:28.343
Try to understand!

00:28:28.719 --> 00:28:32.719
It's stupidity these days when people don't believe in it.

00:28:35.136 --> 00:28:37.136
People are doing all kinds of things,

00:28:37.177 --> 00:28:47.302
they are drinking, they are playing this...money business.

00:28:47.719 --> 00:28:49.844
All kinds of things they are doing

00:28:50.136 --> 00:28:59.136
without having any fear of the wrath of God.

00:29:00.302 --> 00:29:02.343
And that wrath comes from Shiva.

00:29:03.719 --> 00:29:05.343
I would like to warn you all,

00:29:05.719 --> 00:29:08.635
though you are all my children - be careful!

00:29:10.011 --> 00:29:12.468
Try to weigh every step that you take.

00:29:14.886 --> 00:29:17.218
Of course I am there to support you, to help you,

00:29:17.427 --> 00:29:18.343
to protect you.

00:29:18.719 --> 00:29:21.886
But, not beyond Shiva,

00:29:23.302 --> 00:29:24.886
I can't go beyond Him.

00:29:26.302 --> 00:29:35.136
It's such a power of Shiva, it's such an authority of Shiva.

00:29:36.218 --> 00:29:40.635
And to worship Him means to worship goodness in you.

00:29:42.886 --> 00:29:48.302
The goodness could be compassion, could be love,

00:29:48.343 --> 00:29:51.136
could be forgiveness, anything.

00:29:51.218 --> 00:29:53.343
He likes only good people,

00:29:53.719 --> 00:29:56.343
and He will protect only good people.

00:29:56.719 --> 00:30:01.510
For example, some people are very power oriented,

00:30:01.886 --> 00:30:06.385
some are money oriented and some are power oriented.

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:10.719
And the power oriented also do it for money sometimes,

00:30:11.177 --> 00:30:12.719
that's the aim.

00:30:13.177 --> 00:30:16.011
They'll not stay in Sahaj.

00:30:16.385 --> 00:30:19.011
They will be displaced.

00:30:19.385 --> 00:30:21.218
They do it, [and] then come and ask for forgiveness,

00:30:21.635 --> 00:30:24.510
"Oh Mother forgive us, we have done it".

00:30:24.886 --> 00:30:28.343
But try not to do anything of that kind.

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:34.343
I, of course, forgive you, but Shiva, He won't, He won't.

00:30:36.802 --> 00:30:38.302
He will take you to task

00:30:38.343 --> 00:30:39.552
and then you will come to Me "Mother,

00:30:39.844 --> 00:30:42.218
You must save us!" It's very difficult.

00:30:42.635 --> 00:30:46.302
From His clutches it is very difficult.

00:30:46.343 --> 00:30:49.635
Also He's a very forgiving person.

00:30:50.011 --> 00:30:53.302
He forgives you, many things.

00:30:53.385 --> 00:30:56.510
Because of Me also He forgives.

00:30:56.886 --> 00:31:00.011
But, after some time when He takes over,

00:31:01.302 --> 00:31:04.635
there's no appeal, there's no safety.

00:31:05.052 --> 00:31:07.635
I do not want to frighten you,

00:31:08.052 --> 00:31:11.385
but I want to tell you the truth, it is the truth.

00:31:11.802 --> 00:31:15.052
You have to try to be good people.

00:31:16.468 --> 00:31:22.218
You have to try to be really good-charactered people.

00:31:22.635 --> 00:31:26.510
I am told some people who are in Sahaja Yoga

00:31:26.886 --> 00:31:32.510
indulge in money laundering and all that.

00:31:33.302 --> 00:31:36.218
Also some of them have very bad characters,

00:31:36.677 --> 00:31:38.635
they run after girls

00:31:38.969 --> 00:31:43.468
and they try to look at the girls and all sorts of things.

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:48.385
Now this has ruined the west especially.

00:31:48.802 --> 00:31:52.177
Also our Indians are learning from them.

00:31:54.218 --> 00:31:58.177
As it is, we have to respect ourselves.

00:31:58.218 --> 00:32:04.510
If we don't respect ourselves, and we try to misbehave,

00:32:08.343 --> 00:32:12.886
I can only help you with your Kundalini.

00:32:14.677 --> 00:32:19.177
But if you go too much beyond it,

00:32:19.302 --> 00:32:22.677
Ekadesha Rudra will catch, no doubt.

00:32:25.177 --> 00:32:30.343
It's a very big barrier on your forehead.

00:32:31.385 --> 00:32:40.302
Ekadasha Rudra, and it is so effective nowadays, so much active.

00:32:40.677 --> 00:32:45.094
All kinds of diseases which are coming out, is all incurable,

00:32:45.427 --> 00:32:47.510
are because of Ekadesha.

00:32:49.969 --> 00:32:57.177
And also those who are suffering from possessions.

00:32:59.177 --> 00:33:02.802
The other day I met somebody who was very much caught-up.

00:33:05.177 --> 00:33:08.385
And the Ekadesha was working.

00:33:08.802 --> 00:33:14.260
I found out that he is very fanatically

00:33:14.468 --> 00:33:19.177
influenced by something.

00:33:21.177 --> 00:33:23.468
I don't want to name it,

00:33:23.802 --> 00:33:29.802
but these, we have found out, are not correct things.

00:33:31.218 --> 00:33:33.260
In every religion we have

00:33:33.552 --> 00:33:37.552
people who are spreading nonsensical ideas.

00:33:37.969 --> 00:33:41.468
Now if you don't have discretion about it,

00:33:41.552 --> 00:33:43.385
nobody can help you.

00:33:43.802 --> 00:33:46.385
You should have a full discretion

00:33:46.802 --> 00:33:52.468
as to what is right and what is wrong.

00:33:55.552 --> 00:33:58.969
Then Shiva is with you.

00:33:59.343 --> 00:34:01.760
But if you indulge

00:34:02.052 --> 00:34:09.343
into all such nonsensical things, it is self-destructive, I must say

00:34:09.385 --> 00:34:14.677
But to the Self which is destructive is the power of Shiva.

00:34:16.052 --> 00:34:20.677
What we call the Self here, is the power of Shiva.

00:34:23.052 --> 00:34:26.677
He destroys by many things, by many things.

00:34:29.052 --> 00:34:31.552
You can lose your reputation,

00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:34.552
you can lose your health,

00:34:35.969 --> 00:34:38.969
you can lose your wealth,

00:34:40.385 --> 00:34:42.343
everything can happen to you

00:34:42.552 --> 00:34:46.468
till you are completely finished and fagged out.

00:34:51.343 --> 00:34:54.052
I have known people on the death-bed also,

00:34:54.343 --> 00:34:57.343
start talking about money,

00:34:57.385 --> 00:35:00.427
'What should she get, money, how will he get money,

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:01.844
and this and that'.

00:35:03.218 --> 00:35:05.260
Instead of talking about God

00:35:05.552 --> 00:35:09.052
or Self Realisation, they are talking like this.

00:35:10.844 --> 00:35:13.302
It's such a noble thing.

00:35:14.343 --> 00:35:19.677
But if you see Shiva, He doesn't possess anything,

00:35:20.136 --> 00:35:21.969
He doesn't want anything.

00:35:24.343 --> 00:35:26.218
Whatever you give to him,

00:35:26.302 --> 00:35:28.969
as a samarpana or anything,

00:35:29.343 --> 00:35:36.844
that He doesn't accept, and He passes on to the Shakti,

00:35:37.218 --> 00:35:39.218
"You do what you want to do."

00:35:39.302 --> 00:35:44.136
She's the one who is working out everything

00:35:44.468 --> 00:35:50.552
to benefit you to make you happy. He's not bothered.

00:35:50.969 --> 00:35:54.969
In this case, you have to please Shiva!

00:35:55.385 --> 00:35:57.844
He will not try to please you,

00:35:58.218 --> 00:36:01.218
you have to go all the way to please Him.

00:36:01.302 --> 00:36:05.969
It is a very difficult personality of Shiva.

00:36:08.385 --> 00:36:13.552
In the Koran, it is not written separately

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:20.468
for Allah or for Shiva or all these it is not differentiated.

00:36:21.177 --> 00:36:24.385
Because the people with whom He had to deal

00:36:24.719 --> 00:36:27.385
were all uneducated, stupid people.

00:36:27.468 --> 00:36:30.136
So He didn't give all the details that

00:36:30.177 --> 00:36:33.343
God is in different forms.

00:36:33.719 --> 00:36:36.343
So there is only one Allah they know.

00:36:36.719 --> 00:36:40.385
But they don't know anything that

00:36:40.468 --> 00:36:45.136
shows the differentiations of their jobs and work.

00:36:47.177 --> 00:36:51.136
It is the Shakti who loves, I agree.

00:36:51.177 --> 00:36:56.011
But She too, can get angry very much.

00:36:58.385 --> 00:37:01.343
And once She gets angry, there is no end to it!

00:37:04.719 --> 00:37:07.552
Now I have to tell you, as Sahaja Yogis,

00:37:08.011 --> 00:37:12.468
that you develop your qualities to please the Shiva.

00:37:15.844 --> 00:37:23.136
It's too much of hankering, too much of 'wants'.

00:37:25.468 --> 00:37:29.343
All this is not necessary.

00:37:29.719 --> 00:37:34.011
Of course I want you to live well, and beautifully,

00:37:34.177 --> 00:37:37.635
not stupidly - to go into jungles

00:37:38.011 --> 00:37:41.136
or to behave like hippies - that's not the point.

00:37:41.177 --> 00:37:43.011
The point is,

00:37:43.385 --> 00:37:52.011
from your heart, the attachment to things must go away.

00:37:52.385 --> 00:37:56.844
A person who is a Shiva Bhakta

00:38:00.302 --> 00:38:03.011
- he doesn't care for money, he doesn't know about money.

00:38:03.886 --> 00:38:09.302
He is a very generous person, extremely. He's just generous.

00:38:09.343 --> 00:38:14.385
People may say, "Stupid"- the way he goes on, the way he works it.

00:38:14.468 --> 00:38:17.635
But I don't think so.

00:38:18.011 --> 00:38:26.343
That's not at all the description.

00:38:30.468 --> 00:38:33.136
The description of a man

00:38:33.468 --> 00:38:40.468
who is a bhakta of Shiva has no interest in money,

00:38:40.886 --> 00:38:42.886
he's very generous.

00:38:43.302 --> 00:38:47.343
Anything you ask from that, he'll give.

00:38:47.719 --> 00:38:50.177
Mahavira's was like that.

00:38:50.218 --> 00:38:56.385
Mahavira had gone for his meditation in his own garden

00:38:57.635 --> 00:39:04.886
and Vishnu as Shri Krishna

00:39:05.302 --> 00:39:06.719
came and told him that,

00:39:07.177 --> 00:39:09.011
"See, I have no clothes.

00:39:09.385 --> 00:39:14.011
You have got this cloth, why don't you give me half of it?"

00:39:14.385 --> 00:39:21.302
He said, "All right, you can have it. You can have the whole. "

00:39:22.385 --> 00:39:28.510
Because he said this, "My house is here, I'll just wear my clothes"

00:39:28.886 --> 00:39:31.011
What he did was not

00:39:31.468 --> 00:39:36.302
to show that nudity is a very great thing.

00:39:36.343 --> 00:39:38.802
But if you see the Jains, what to do,

00:39:39.177 --> 00:39:47.302
they make big, big statues of Mahavira

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:50.302
showing Him completely nude.

00:39:50.343 --> 00:39:53.468
I mean, this is the perversion of human mind.

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:56.468
Why He did it, we should know.

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:59.635
He was so detached, so detached. So,

00:40:00.011 --> 00:40:03.385
give away the clothes, what is the harm?

00:40:03.802 --> 00:40:06.302
It was not to show-off or anything.

00:40:06.385 --> 00:40:12.052
But the generosity, people don't understand.

00:40:12.468 --> 00:40:15.802
And the Jainies are the least generous!

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:25.218
So the quality of all these great incarnations is also not understood.

00:40:25.635 --> 00:40:33.802
Because a kind of an illusion is there.

00:40:34.177 --> 00:40:41.218
For example, Shiva is always with very few clothes, very few.

00:40:43.635 --> 00:40:47.802
And what does he eat? No-one knows.

00:40:49.177 --> 00:40:54.052
What is his desires and what does he want? No-one knows.

00:40:55.468 --> 00:41:00.302
A person with a great knowledge of music will sing before him,

00:41:00.385 --> 00:41:01.468
He's alright.

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:05.218
Or even any madcap comes and sings, He's alright.

00:41:07.677 --> 00:41:10.218
For Him it doesn't matter,

00:41:10.677 --> 00:41:16.218
He's not meticulous about how the music is and what the notes are,

00:41:16.677 --> 00:41:19.802
whether it is alright or not, no.

00:41:20.177 --> 00:41:22.468
He is beyond all these things.

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:27.052
He is beyond all these formalities that we have about everything,

00:41:27.468 --> 00:41:30.302
he is beyond.

00:41:30.677 --> 00:41:35.969
He is spirituality itself, he is beyond all these things.

00:41:36.343 --> 00:41:41.635
Whether you are a musician or you are an artist,

00:41:41.969 --> 00:41:46.969
whatever it is you are, He'll enjoy.

00:41:47.343 --> 00:41:51.385
He's the enjoyer, and He'll enjoy -

00:41:51.802 --> 00:41:57.802
whatever is simple, whatever is given with the heart, He'll enjoy.

00:41:58.177 --> 00:42:01.177
Whatever is expressed with the heart, He'll enjoy.

00:42:01.302 --> 00:42:05.510
He is not a conditioned person,

00:42:05.969 --> 00:42:10.385
that it should be modern, it should be such and such.

00:42:10.802 --> 00:42:12.343
He is not conditioned.

00:42:12.385 --> 00:42:17.343
He doesn't think that way like human beings who will sit down

00:42:17.385 --> 00:42:22.552
and make a meticulous everything, does it fit into it or not.

00:42:22.969 --> 00:42:26.468
Even, even for art,

00:42:26.552 --> 00:42:32.343
even for anything that is created out of somebody's heart,

00:42:32.385 --> 00:42:35.802
they will try to discourage that person.

00:42:37.218 --> 00:42:41.552
I have seen people, they have such conditioning.

00:42:41.969 --> 00:42:45.343
And one thing about Shiva, he has no

00:42:45.385 --> 00:42:48.969
conditioning of any kind, nothing.

00:42:49.552 --> 00:42:52.468
That's why they call him a mast-maulaa

00:42:52.552 --> 00:42:55.385
- He is not at all conditioned.

00:42:55.844 --> 00:42:58.385
If you have any conditioning in your mind,

00:42:58.594 --> 00:43:00.385
then you are not a Shiva bhakta.

00:43:00.844 --> 00:43:03.969
It's all right, you should dress up well, you should do this,

00:43:04.343 --> 00:43:07.969
but you should not have conditioning that 'If you don't do that

00:43:08.343 --> 00:43:16.385
you are being out of cast, out of fashion, out of this'.

00:43:17.844 --> 00:43:22.844
It is very difficult for people not to accept.

00:43:24.218 --> 00:43:27.552
All kinds of fashions are coming nowadays, all kinds.

00:43:27.969 --> 00:43:31.468
I tell them, "What is this?" "Oh this is the fashion. "

00:43:31.552 --> 00:43:34.677
Is it some God behind this fashion,

00:43:35.136 --> 00:43:38.302
or is there some deity who is telling you these fashions?

00:43:38.677 --> 00:43:41.136
Today it comes, tomorrow it will disappear.

00:43:42.302 --> 00:43:44.218
So, what I am saying,

00:43:44.302 --> 00:43:48.468
that if you have to worship Shiva,

00:43:48.552 --> 00:43:51.468
you should de-condition yourself.

00:43:52.218 --> 00:43:55.302
You are living in the world of Sahasrara.

00:43:56.136 --> 00:44:00.468
Now, somebody is not properly dressed - finished!

00:44:00.552 --> 00:44:04.136
Somebody is over-popularly dressed - finished!

00:44:04.302 --> 00:44:09.136
Human beings have a capacity to criticise everyone.

00:44:10.468 --> 00:44:14.719
And to criticise everyone, this is nothing fundamental

00:44:15.136 --> 00:44:18.552
because if you do it on vibrations, one can understand.

00:44:18.969 --> 00:44:21.136
But not on vibrations, just

00:44:21.177 --> 00:44:26.552
because 'this is not the fashion, that is not the fashion'.

00:44:27.969 --> 00:44:31.468
What is the fashion of Shiva, tell me.

00:44:31.844 --> 00:44:33.969
Has He any fashions?

00:44:35.385 --> 00:44:37.719
Anything you give Him, He's happy.

00:44:38.136 --> 00:44:40.719
Whatever you give Him, He eats that.

00:44:41.136 --> 00:44:49.719
He is full of such appreciation because He is personified as Joy.

00:44:50.385 --> 00:44:53.177
He is peace and He is joy.

00:44:53.552 --> 00:44:57.218
If you are worshippers of Shiva,

00:44:57.343 --> 00:45:03.719
then you should not have any conditioning of any kind.

00:45:06.552 --> 00:45:10.719
I mean, normally I also wear simple saris, very simple.

00:45:11.136 --> 00:45:15.844
And it happens that people think I am a very poor woman.

00:45:16.218 --> 00:45:17.844
I am poor

00:45:19.302 --> 00:45:24.343
because I don't care for money, I don't bother.

00:45:24.719 --> 00:45:34.343
So, we should know that Shiva is the poorest man, purest God.

00:45:34.719 --> 00:45:40.302
He doesn't wear any alankaras, he doesn't wear anything, just

00:45:41.343 --> 00:45:44.343
he lives with his own body.

00:45:44.719 --> 00:45:51.177
Because he is nothing but embodiment of enjoyment,

00:45:51.635 --> 00:46:00.011
nothing but complete form of enjoyment and joy.

00:46:01.385 --> 00:46:06.011
So another quality of Shiva bhakta* should be joy.

00:46:07.343 --> 00:46:11.011
You should be joyous about everything

00:46:11.385 --> 00:46:16.136
- whatever you see, whatever type of person you see.

00:46:16.343 --> 00:46:18.468
So the only way you can do, is

00:46:18.886 --> 00:46:22.719
give up human quality of criticism

00:46:25.635 --> 00:46:27.886
- to criticise others.

00:46:28.302 --> 00:46:31.468
Like if the English go into the Indian house,

00:46:31.886 --> 00:46:33.136
they say "We don't like it. "

00:46:33.218 --> 00:46:34.468
"Just, what, what you don't like?"

00:46:34.886 --> 00:46:37.468
"We didn't like the carpet. "

00:46:37.886 --> 00:46:43.719
'I don't like it' itself is against Shiva Shakti.

00:46:44.177 --> 00:46:48.177
Then, if supposing an American goes to an English home,

00:46:48.218 --> 00:46:51.302
he'll say, "I don't like it. " It's very common.

00:46:51.343 --> 00:46:54.886
All the people say "I don't like it", "I didn't like that".

00:46:55.302 --> 00:46:57.011
Who are you

00:46:57.385 --> 00:47:00.635
to say 'I don't like it' or 'I like it'.

00:47:01.011 --> 00:47:05.385
People don't realise that by saying all these things,

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:10.011
you are showing that there is no Shiva principle in you.

00:47:13.385 --> 00:47:17.218
I can understand somebody who cannot walk, alright,

00:47:17.635 --> 00:47:23.302
for such a person is allowed to use some sticks or something,

00:47:23.343 --> 00:47:25.343
allowed.

00:47:25.802 --> 00:47:27.302
But if he says "I don't like that person

00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:29.886
because he doesn't use the stick.",

00:47:30.302 --> 00:47:34.177
shows that he is such an egoistical fellow;

00:47:34.218 --> 00:47:38.218
himself he is using the stick and

00:47:38.552 --> 00:47:41.719
he wants to create what, votes or what,

00:47:41.927 --> 00:47:44.635
in a democratic country, that people should

00:47:44.927 --> 00:47:49.635
walk with the sticks in their hands. It is very difficult.

00:47:50.011 --> 00:47:52.886
In the west it is very common, you see,

00:47:53.302 --> 00:47:55.218
to have this kind of a hat,

00:47:55.635 --> 00:47:58.468
to have this kind of a dress,

00:47:58.510 --> 00:48:00.385
to wear this kind of a cheroot.

00:48:00.677 --> 00:48:04.302
All kinds of things have a conditioning.

00:48:05.385 --> 00:48:10.802
Nowadays the hairstyle has become very funny with women.

00:48:11.177 --> 00:48:14.468
Because they don't put oil in their hair.

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:21.385
They will not have any grease in their head.

00:48:21.802 --> 00:48:25.177
If somebody's going to meet them they will wash their hair.

00:48:26.218 --> 00:48:28.468
I don't think it looks very nice.

00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:29.802
Of course I don't say that

00:48:30.177 --> 00:48:35.052
you need not have so much of oil on your face and ears.

00:48:35.468 --> 00:48:38.510
But, what is so important?

00:48:41.218 --> 00:48:50.385
In life, is also this is another thing that we are very self-centred.

00:48:51.886 --> 00:48:54.177
We want to impress people.

00:48:55.677 --> 00:49:02.468
If I wear a dress or anything, it should impress.

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:07.177
I mean, even it impresses - what?

00:49:08.218 --> 00:49:12.218
If a snake comes along, he will bit you, whatever dress

00:49:13.052 --> 00:49:16.677
you might be wearing, whatever country you might be from.

00:49:17.052 --> 00:49:24.802
All this kind of identification, it doesn't behove a Shiva bhakta.

00:49:27.177 --> 00:49:29.802
A Shiva bhakta has to be just

00:49:30.177 --> 00:49:34.802
absolutely lost in the raptures of joy.

00:49:36.969 --> 00:49:42.385
Very particular about hairdress, very particular about dresses

00:49:42.594 --> 00:49:45.343
- I don't know what they are particular about.

00:49:45.385 --> 00:49:49.385
With all that, what do they gain? Nothing.

00:49:50.802 --> 00:49:52.844
Do they become popular?

00:49:53.635 --> 00:49:56.136
And this kind of popularity,

00:49:56.468 --> 00:49:59.969
which is so skin-deep, what's the use?

00:50:01.343 --> 00:50:05.969
You must have respect, respect of your being.

00:50:06.343 --> 00:50:12.218
As not only human beings, but as Sahaja Yogis.

00:50:13.302 --> 00:50:15.343
You are Sahaja Yogis.

00:50:15.385 --> 00:50:21.052
We are Shiva's bhaktas, we don't care.

00:50:22.468 --> 00:50:24.052
We are not bothered.

00:50:25.385 --> 00:50:30.302
Whatever it is, Shiva is there within us

00:50:30.552 --> 00:50:40.385
and we shine with that power within us that is of Kundalini.

00:50:42.552 --> 00:50:45.302
You may be very well dressed, you may be anything.

00:50:45.677 --> 00:50:47.969
If your vibrations are bad, what's the use?

00:50:49.343 --> 00:50:51.136
If you cannot judge people

00:50:51.468 --> 00:50:54.136
by their vibrations,by nonsensical things

00:50:54.468 --> 00:50:59.760
like their dress and moustaches, is it of any value?

00:51:00.052 --> 00:51:05.385
In Sahaja Yoga your value system has to be Sahaj.

00:51:07.844 --> 00:51:10.052
I have seen many people,

00:51:10.468 --> 00:51:13.343
"I don't like their house, I didn't like this …"

00:51:13.385 --> 00:51:19.052
'I don't like' is the sentence, is nishiddha,

00:51:19.468 --> 00:51:22.844
is to be given up by Sahaja Yogis.

00:51:26.218 --> 00:51:28.552
If you don't like anything, you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:51:32.468 --> 00:51:38.677
Now, of course, I mean, if there is somebody who is anti-Sahaj and all that,

00:51:39.136 --> 00:51:43.552
but still by saying 'I don't like', what are you going to gain?

00:51:45.468 --> 00:51:47.343
It's a waste of energy.

00:51:51.468 --> 00:51:56.468
Because of this, in Sahaja Yoga I have seen,

00:51:56.552 --> 00:52:00.677
people have created problems for Me, so many problems.

00:52:01.136 --> 00:52:05.552
Only because they are so much 'self' oriented.

00:52:07.969 --> 00:52:11.969
"This man is bad, that woman is bad, he is this, that …"

00:52:12.343 --> 00:52:13.677
Sometimes I am surprised.

00:52:13.969 --> 00:52:16.969
Because when those people come to me,

00:52:17.302 --> 00:52:20.552
I am amazed that they are very nice people.

00:52:21.969 --> 00:52:25.468
But people are very self-centred, also.

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:30.552
Like I have seen people who are not bothered

00:52:30.969 --> 00:52:37.844
to come to meetings, to pujas.

00:52:39.218 --> 00:52:41.385
Because they have got work.

00:52:43.468 --> 00:52:49.468
Altogether there are eleven pujas, but they don't come.

00:52:51.844 --> 00:52:54.468
Because they are very busy.

00:52:55.844 --> 00:52:58.136
At least to one puja you should come.

00:52:59.218 --> 00:53:07.844
But those who are Shiva bhaktas only enjoy nothing but pujas.

00:53:08.385 --> 00:53:10.385
Nothing else

00:53:11.468 --> 00:53:17.719
Their whole being is absolutely vibrated with Shiva puja.

00:53:18.136 --> 00:53:20.844
To them, that's the most important thing to do.

00:53:22.218 --> 00:53:25.136
Also there are people in Sahaja Yoga

00:53:25.177 --> 00:53:28.468
who are trying to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:28.844 --> 00:53:32.343
Very wrong, very wrong, very wrong.

00:53:33.719 --> 00:53:38.136
Sahaja Yoga is to give you punyas,

00:53:38.177 --> 00:53:40.552
to give you blessings,

00:53:41.011 --> 00:53:44.177
and if that is not in your mind,

00:53:44.635 --> 00:53:45.552
better give up Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:45.802 --> 00:53:49.136
You can join some business or something

00:53:49.177 --> 00:53:52.011
of malpractices very easily, very easily.

00:53:52.385 --> 00:53:54.635
Till you end up in the jail you are there.

00:53:58.011 --> 00:54:03.468
But to enjoy your spiritual powers

00:54:03.844 --> 00:54:06.468
you must learn certain things.

00:54:06.844 --> 00:54:10.343
And one of them is de-condition yourself

00:54:10.719 --> 00:54:14.343
- 'I don't like it' or 'I like it' -

00:54:14.635 --> 00:54:18.886
this sentence must go away from your tongue!

00:54:24.177 --> 00:54:25.302
Likes and dislikes

00:54:25.343 --> 00:54:28.302
are only for people who have limited vision.

00:54:31.343 --> 00:54:34.635
You should learn to appreciate.

00:54:35.011 --> 00:54:37.343
Your power of appreciation will show

00:54:37.719 --> 00:54:40.760
how spiritually you are endowed.

00:54:44.136 --> 00:54:49.635
And your power of observation

00:54:49.927 --> 00:54:52.136
will show what do you observe.

00:54:53.218 --> 00:54:56.011
For example, some people will come and tell me,

00:54:56.218 --> 00:55:00.635
"I didn't like that lady, she was wearing a funny sari. "

00:55:02.011 --> 00:55:03.635
I mean, what is this?

00:55:06.011 --> 00:55:11.218
"I didn't like her, because she was putting her hand on her head".

00:55:11.635 --> 00:55:13.510
So what?

00:55:14.886 --> 00:55:17.719
Because you make your own images of people, and you want

00:55:19.177 --> 00:55:22.177
everybody to be like that, otherwise you don't like it.

00:55:22.635 --> 00:55:26.302
Whether you like it or don't like it, nobody's going to change.

00:55:27.343 --> 00:55:29.635
Why waste your energy?

00:55:31.385 --> 00:55:34.719
Sometimes there are musicians who are not so good.

00:55:41.635 --> 00:55:49.802
I remember, once I went home and I asked my father,

00:55:50.177 --> 00:55:52.218
"How does this musician sing?"

00:55:52.635 --> 00:55:56.468
He says, "He's very courageous, very courageous. "

00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:58.468
I said, "Why, what happened?"

00:55:58.719 --> 00:56:03.302
He said (?), "He sings without bothering about it

00:56:03.343 --> 00:56:05.760
and he goes out of tune sometimes,

00:56:05.969 --> 00:56:08.177
he goes out of taala, doesn't matter,

00:56:08.218 --> 00:56:09.510
but he sings.

00:56:09.886 --> 00:56:11.635
He's very courageous, himmatwala"

00:56:12.011 --> 00:56:16.177
So, that's how he used to appreciate, I have seen.

00:56:16.218 --> 00:56:21.510
When this fellow started singing, I saw he was like that,

00:56:21.886 --> 00:56:26.886
but my father was saying "Wa-wa, wa-wa" to him and encouraging him.

00:56:27.302 --> 00:56:31.218
You see, I have seen in my father these divine qualities,

00:56:31.635 --> 00:56:34.510
how he used to tolerate,

00:56:34.886 --> 00:56:39.052
how he used to - I mean not tolerance also, just appreciation.

00:56:39.468 --> 00:56:42.886
Of any kind of thing he used to appreciate.

00:56:43.052 --> 00:56:46.094
That's what, if the Sahaja Yogis have that

00:56:46.385 --> 00:56:51.385
condition of appreciation they will enjoy everything.

00:56:51.594 --> 00:56:54.802
Because you kill your enjoyment, do you know that?

00:56:57.218 --> 00:57:00.802
You are all variety of people here, all variety of dresses,

00:57:00.969 --> 00:57:05.677
all variety of families and so many countries you are here -

00:57:06.052 --> 00:57:09.468
to Me you are nothing but Sahaja Yogis, my children, that's all.

00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:14.969
Now I don't go on judging you on your dress, or

00:57:15.136 --> 00:57:18.052
on what your hairstyle is, no.

00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:22.677
All modern things are extremely conditioning.

00:57:24.677 --> 00:57:30.677
And they condition you so much that you get irresponsible.

00:57:31.677 --> 00:57:34.218
As Sahaja Yogis you get irresponsible.

00:57:34.677 --> 00:57:39.468
Your first and foremost responsibility is Sahaja Yoga.

00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:42.385
Because you should know what a work it is.

00:57:43.802 --> 00:57:50.302
It is such a great work, to transform the whole world - that is My vision.

00:57:50.677 --> 00:57:53.969
At this old age also I think the same way.

00:57:54.343 --> 00:57:58.677
Now, if that is My vision, what should be your attitude?

00:57:59.052 --> 00:58:03.302
That we should go all out to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:58:03.677 --> 00:58:05.385
That's the main thing.

00:58:05.802 --> 00:58:12.969
I call you for these pujas just to renovate, I should say, or

00:58:13.343 --> 00:58:16.677
to give you more of energy and all that.

00:58:17.052 --> 00:58:19.886
But if you are just taking it as a great

00:58:20.136 --> 00:58:23.136
blessings and sitting at home it's of no use.

00:58:24.302 --> 00:58:26.218
You must spread Sahaja Yoga!

00:58:26.302 --> 00:58:29.468
I was surprised that they said

00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:35.969
in Lucknow there are only 200 Sahaja Yogis. How can that be?

00:58:36.468 --> 00:58:38.468
First time I went to Lucknow,

00:58:38.677 --> 00:58:41.052
there were at least three thousand Sahaja Yogis

00:58:41.468 --> 00:58:44.552
and we had not fixed any hall or anything.

00:58:44.969 --> 00:58:49.052
And can you imagine, suddenly I find so many people.

00:58:50.468 --> 00:58:53.343
How is it there can be two hundred Sahaja Yogis?

00:58:53.385 --> 00:58:58.552
Either you are telling lies, or you are good for nothing.

00:58:59.969 --> 00:59:02.969
So the responsibility of all the Sahaja Yogis,

00:59:03.218 --> 00:59:08.302
of all the Sahaja Yogis, first and foremost,

00:59:08.677 --> 00:59:10.468
is to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:59:11.552 --> 00:59:13.677
How many people have you given realisation?

00:59:15.052 --> 00:59:17.302
Where have you talked about Sahaja Yoga?

00:59:17.677 --> 00:59:21.052
I have seen even in the plane, if you are travelling,

00:59:21.343 --> 00:59:26.094
anyone who is there will tell Me "My guru is this,

00:59:26.385 --> 00:59:29.052
you know, such a great guru, this that. "

00:59:29.468 --> 00:59:32.844
Openly, shamelessly, about horrible gurus!

00:59:33.427 --> 00:59:40.343
While you people are very shy to talk about Sahaja Yoga.

00:59:41.468 --> 00:59:44.552
Never publicly unless and until

00:59:44.969 --> 00:59:49.343
you have a programme, and public programme and all that.

00:59:51.468 --> 00:59:56.343
You have no time, also, for Sahaja Yoga, very busy people.

01:00:00.844 --> 01:00:08.094
So, if you have to follow Shiva and His blessings all the time,

01:00:08.302 --> 01:00:09.844
His protection to you...

01:00:10.136 --> 01:00:17.552
then you have to be Sahaja Yogis of very high quality.

01:00:19.969 --> 01:00:22.969
It shows when you go all out

01:00:23.385 --> 01:00:25.302
to spread Sahaja Yoga.

01:00:28.218 --> 01:00:30.552
That is the thing missing.

01:00:30.969 --> 01:00:33.844
I am so very happy that in Australia

01:00:34.218 --> 01:00:36.552
Sahaja Yoga has spread so much.

01:00:36.969 --> 01:00:40.302
I don't know what has happened.

01:00:40.719 --> 01:00:44.218
In a far-fetched place like Australia.

01:00:45.136 --> 01:00:48.385
In the beginning I had some set-backs

01:00:48.468 --> 01:00:53.260
but now it has spread. Also in Austria it has spread.

01:00:53.427 --> 01:00:56.136
And also in Italy.

01:00:58.218 --> 01:01:03.218
But otherwise, just doesn't spread. What's the matter?

01:01:03.343 --> 01:01:07.177
The matter is the leaders are not going all-out.

01:01:07.552 --> 01:01:11.468
Say, for in England I travelled from north to south,

01:01:11.844 --> 01:01:14.385
east to west in all the directions.

01:01:17.136 --> 01:01:22.552
We have very poor, very poor Sahaja Yogis there.

01:01:23.011 --> 01:01:28.136
You have to go to universities, to younger people.

01:01:29.218 --> 01:01:35.177
If hippy-ism can spread, why not Sahaja Yoga?

01:01:37.177 --> 01:01:42.719
It spread like wild-fire, why not Sahaja Yoga?

01:01:43.136 --> 01:01:49.719
All these things are there, which I have to warn you - be careful!

01:01:51.136 --> 01:01:54.844
If you have got Realisation, you have a responsibility

01:01:55.302 --> 01:02:00.385
- to give realisation to others, and to spread Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:03.468 --> 01:02:07.343
If you can't do it, then God save you.

01:02:07.719 --> 01:02:09.136
I have nothing to say.

01:02:11.177 --> 01:02:13.177
You have to introspect,

01:02:13.635 --> 01:02:15.635
'What have I done for Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:17.011 --> 01:02:18.635
What have I got from Sahaja Yoga?'

01:02:21.011 --> 01:02:24.844
And I am sure after this Shiva puja,

01:02:25.094 --> 01:02:29.719
you will dedicate yourself to Shiva principle within you.

01:02:30.011 --> 01:02:34.011
Shiva principle doesn't 'stir out',

01:02:34.385 --> 01:02:43.136
it's very, very stern, it's very powerful.

01:02:46.218 --> 01:02:51.635
You have to dedicate, and you have to surrender.

01:02:52.011 --> 01:02:58.343
Above every other job, above every other performance,

01:02:58.719 --> 01:03:00.635
the highest is this.

01:03:01.011 --> 01:03:08.886
So, with this, I ask Shiva to give you blessings,

01:03:09.302 --> 01:03:11.218
complete blessings,

01:03:11.635 --> 01:03:17.510
so that you get transformed into the personality of Shiva.

01:03:17.886 --> 01:03:18.510
May God bless you all.
