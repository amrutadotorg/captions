00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.920
face yourself

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.279
for becoming

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.640
and then

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.640
the preparation is done

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.200
to become something

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.879
and on the whole when you know that it

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.079
is your ego and superego

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.079
which are loading you up

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.840
you have to scan them out with vibrato

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.840
awareness

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.840
now there are two

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.360
types of

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:19.360
attention we have to pay

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.360
first is a constant attention

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.280
that is a routine of a sahaja yogi

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.840
and the second one is the emergency

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.840
attention

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.640
i've been saying that all the sahaja

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.680
yogis must start

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.680
writing their diaries

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.439
one with every day's experiences

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:49.360
if you know that you have to write a

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.360
diary you'll keep your mind alert

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.759
and another one whenever you get any

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.360
special idea

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.960
of the past or of the future also to jot

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.040
it down so like that you should have two

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.439
dice

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.280
for your constant attention you have to

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.560
fix up your mind

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.520
on certain facts the first one as i said

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.640
that

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.640
if you keep a diary

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.599
then you will know that you have to

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.640
remember what important things have

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.959
happened

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.360
so your attention will be alert and

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.480
you'll be looking out for such points

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.920
where what is the thing you see

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.840
and you'll be amazed if you make your

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.080
attention alert

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:38.000
what new things come to you

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.959
very brilliant ideas

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.239
and the miracles of life and the

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.640
miracles of

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:49.440
god's beauty and his auspiciousness his

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.280
greatness his kindness his blessings how

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.680
they work out if you start writing every

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.879
day

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.360
even two lines about it

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:59.840
it will make your mind constantly

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:04.319
involved with it

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:09.519
that's a human style of doing things

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.519
also you can mention in the diary

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.959
what happened did you could you do your

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.720
meditation did you get your time for

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.400
meditation

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.879
a little bit as if you are

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.760
appearing for some sort of a examination

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.680
or something you

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.959
prepare a little note like that did i

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.959
get up in the morning did i

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.840
then any special thought or any special

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.400
movement

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.360
in the center or left or right also

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.360
should be mentioned so that

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.799
you keep a watch on your mind it's a

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:50.000
very good thing to maintain a diary

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:52.159
also you will see progressively how your

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.200
ideas are changing

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:57.680
how new priorities are settling down how

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.959
you give more importance

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.280
to real things and very little to unreal

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.280
things

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.760
i think this is a very very practical

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:10.560
side of human beings

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.200
that one should have a diary same

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.000
diaries after sometimes

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.120
will become historical things and people

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.639
would like to see

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.840
what you all have written not to be

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.800
hypocritical about it or deceptive about

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.880
it

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:32.080
but quite truthful and understanding

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.560
you should jot down few lies just before

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.560
sleeping

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:44.720
now we have to see that we have

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:47.600
problems for superego and ego

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.040
now superego is the left side as

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.759
darkness

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:56.800
tamagura and our past

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:58.160
those who have left side problems should

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.560
think of the future

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.840
use them balance if they think of the

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:07.039
future

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:11.360
for example a person

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:13.600
who is lethargic should take to working

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.840
put your mind into working for the

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.199
future planning what to do where to go

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.880
how to do that will keep you

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:27.120
away from drag up the

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:29.039
left side and

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.360
gradually then you can balance yourself

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.360
also

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:43.039
now the right side

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:45.280
of a person when it is activated very

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:45.280
much

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.680
he has to balance it

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.360
not with the left side but with the

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:59.840
center

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.840
that is a person who is very hardworking

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:12.479
must develop a witness statement

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:14.960
you try to do a work any work

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:17.280
indulge into work in thoughtless

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:21.919
awareness

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:26.240
as a witness whatever work you are doing

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:26.240
you just say that i am not doing it

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.960
this you can do it after realization

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.240
become thoughtlessly aware

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:37.120
and start doing your work

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.039
so the compensation of the left side is

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.720
done by movement to the right

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:43.600
and of the right side movement in the

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.919
center left side is the tamaguna

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.759
right side is the rajoguna the center is

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:50.560
the septum

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:51.599
still these are three good eyes that's

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.160
not the state

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:55.919
which you have to achieve about this

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.800
i'll tell you tomorrow more

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:58.800
how to go further

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:07.280
after scanning out which side is weak

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:09.120
you should plan out your style of life

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.639
for example if you are extremely

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.919
lethargic you cannot get up in the

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:13.680
morning

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:17.039
you feel very sleepy in the night you do

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:19.120
not feel alerted then start planning

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:21.520
as to what will you do how will you get

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.280
up even puja is a good idea

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.639
home is a good idea do something like

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.720
that you see so that

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:28.400
you have to do something what you call

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.880
the kriya is the action

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.479
get into the action some sort of action

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:36.240
you're going to

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:37.680
in sahaja yoga as well as in your daily

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.319
life

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.080
you'll be able to change that mood and

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:43.759
come to the right side

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.199
and then you go to the move your

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:50.160
movement should be towards the

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:50.160
satyaguna is to watch everything

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.360
now at this point where you are in the

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.360
center

00:07:56.879 --> 00:07:59.840
you have to see

00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:03.520
how much you are misidentified

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.280
so supposing you are at the first stage

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:14.560
of left side then you will just

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.840
do dreaming oh this person is so much

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.759
identified that one is so much

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.720
identified as if you are the best

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:22.240
is human nature you see well that person

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.319
is like that he's like that

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.319
this is very bad in the society that is

00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:28.560
going bad in the society

00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:30.400
it's better then we can also go to this

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.000
limitless to that guru is very bad

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.240
and that one is another mad gap like

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.240
that this is all day dreaming going on

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.680
how far it is affecting you how far you

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.640
are improving by that is not

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:42.560
it's just you see thinking analyzing it

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.560
it's insane this stuff

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.000
sitting down and just analyzing it's

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:49.040
amazing stuff

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.040
the second thing could be

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.880
when you come to the second side of it

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.560
is the kriya

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.640
then what happens when you start doing

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.399
it

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.920
then at least your attention is on what

00:08:58.399 --> 00:09:01.760
you are doing

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.080
it's not allowed to drift into something

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.600
and which goes into any nonsense and can

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.160
i mean then you don't know from where

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.320
the funny thoughts are coming

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.320
so you start doing something you can go

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.160
and plant some trees or you can go and

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.839
plant some

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.360
flowers or if you want you can do some

00:09:15.839 --> 00:09:20.560
cooking you can do some work

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:24.240
take to work that will help you

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:26.640
any work but while doing the work

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.240
the problem will be you'll develop ego

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.600
that's why when you are developing the

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.560
ego

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.279
you have to tell yourself you are not

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.080
doing mister

00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:37.200
this you are not doing this is not doing

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.600
you are not doing

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.279
if you go on suggesting to yourself mr

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.720
ego will not come

00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:44.720
and then many things you see which

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.200
normally trouble you and trouble others

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.760
like

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.440
you have cleaned the room all right then

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.680
somebody comes and spoils it you get

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.360
angry with that person

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.040
naturally because you think you have

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.640
done

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.920
first of all you don't clean the room if

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.600
you clean the room then you'll be

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:02.080
prepared it will be dirty otherwise you

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.080
do clean

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:08.880
now if it is dirty well and good if it

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.880
is not directed well and good

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:16.000
this type of attitude you should take

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:18.880
to jump onto saturn on sattva guna you

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.079
start accepting it you become extremely

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:23.440
mild

00:10:20.079 --> 00:10:26.800
you become a mild personality then

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:29.680
at that time you do not discuss as to

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:31.120
oh i don't like it this was wrong this

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.800
should not have been all these things do

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:36.640
not come to you in saturn

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:38.480
you start seeing it that time you see

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:41.920
that all right doesn't matter it's done

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:45.279
it's time on the contrary you feel hurt

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:47.519
if you are a satyaguni that

00:10:45.279 --> 00:10:50.160
by any suggestion you have suggested

00:10:47.519 --> 00:10:50.160
your ego

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.880
can you get that point you feel ashamed

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.519
of your ego i mean to say

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.800
if you are a sabzi for example even to

00:10:57.519 --> 00:11:01.519
say that this is my car

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.560
you will feel shy that's a sattvuli

00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:04.480
style

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.399
or even to say why did you spoil my

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.320
carpet i mean in india nobody will say

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:10.000
i can tell you this regarded bad manners

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.440
absolute bad manners

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.800
if anybody comes to your house and the

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.200
carpet is well they sell it doesn't

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.480
matter

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.120
even it is brought i don't know let it

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.120
be auto burnt

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.800
they'll never say that you're burnt by

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:24.160
carpet or done anything to my

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.959
is regarded bad manners like here you

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.760
see

00:11:24.959 --> 00:11:28.160
somebody sleeping somebody makes the

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.600
noise

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.279
the person who is sleeping will never

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.079
say that you are making noise

00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:36.880
let me get it he'll just get up and ask

00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:36.880
do you need anything

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.040
that's difficult for people here to

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:43.360
understand because ego is

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.720
just sitting on there but these bad

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.160
manners

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:48.160
there you will find when you will go to

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.279
india you'll find this these are bad

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.240
manners

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:53.200
to say that or to say oh i feel very

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.959
comfortable

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.680
i mean to say i feel comfortable is bad

00:11:54.959 --> 00:12:00.880
manners i mean they never say

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:02.720
i like it so what

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.720
all these words are not to be said if

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.680
you are in satragoni then you just don't

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:10.480
say

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:12.880
you say do you like it is it comfortable

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:16.240
would like to have this before attention

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.240
goes from your side

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.000
you understand that

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:24.320
that is the style one has to develop

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.240
then you are a satwa guri

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.440
otherwise you are still on ego trip you

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:32.079
see whatever you may say

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:32.079
i don't like that i don't i who are you

00:12:33.279 --> 00:12:36.320
first of all ask the question who are

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.240
you

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:41.360
if god says i don't like you i can

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:44.000
understand the reasons

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:47.440
but for you to say i don't like it after

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.440
all how did you come on this earth

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:53.920
how did you get a human birth

00:12:52.399 --> 00:12:56.320
how did you get all these things nothing

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.320
like that

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.040
who am i

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:07.600
i am nothing everybody who thinks i am

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.440
something he should know

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.040
that he is nothing makes no difference

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.480
to god whether he exists or does not

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:15.440
exist you see

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.440
he's not he's just

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:21.680
so this point if you understand that

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.760
even if you do something any work you do

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:26.880
or anything you are doing

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:29.279
you are just doing it because you want

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.279
to do it

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:36.800
that is how you come on to satyaguna

00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:38.320
but normally it doesn't happen it

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.320
happens the other way around for example

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:44.720
a person

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:48.160
is say

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:50.320
doing something by any chance

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.680
he feels hurt or he thinks that whatever

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.839
he's done is no good

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.880
people don't appreciate or maybe he

00:13:53.839 --> 00:13:56.959
might think that

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:58.959
oh it's not up to the point or whatever

00:13:56.959 --> 00:14:01.199
it is

00:13:58.959 --> 00:14:03.199
then the reaction for him is not that he

00:14:01.199 --> 00:14:03.839
does not like to rise to satyaguna but

00:14:03.199 --> 00:14:06.959
he rises

00:14:03.839 --> 00:14:08.959
he goes back to them

00:14:06.959 --> 00:14:10.160
all right i'll not do it i'll sleep over

00:14:08.959 --> 00:14:12.959
it let them do it

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.959
why should i do it

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:17.600
so the training that you have to have

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:21.199
through your rajaguna

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:22.160
goes the waste it's just a training

00:14:21.199 --> 00:14:25.760
period

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:27.519
that you have you are doing something

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:31.440
now in the training period you have to

00:14:27.519 --> 00:14:34.720
learn only how to

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:37.040
come in the center for example now

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:40.240
water is required for you to swim if

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:40.240
there is no water you cannot say

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.160
all right in the same way rajoguna is

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:47.519
required for you

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:49.360
to come to satyukra

00:14:47.519 --> 00:14:52.160
if you do not do any work you cannot

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.160
come to satoku

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:56.000
so you are just working just to train

00:14:54.959 --> 00:14:58.560
yourself

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.440
to be a witness now do you follow that

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.360
point

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.639
you are not doing it because you like

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.480
particular thing you are used to

00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:05.040
particular thing because you want to be

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.079
this

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.079
this is not the way it is

00:15:08.959 --> 00:15:13.519
you are just doing it to learn how to be

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:16.880
patient

00:15:13.519 --> 00:15:20.079
to practice your patience

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:22.880
to see how much patient you are

00:15:20.079 --> 00:15:24.320
once you start doing it you'll be amazed

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:27.839
that you will never feel the burden of

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.839
the work

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:34.560
but it never happens most of the people

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.440
if they find their work is not effective

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:40.079
they'll go back to tamagona

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.440
there are many attitudes say is working

00:15:40.079 --> 00:15:41.759
then he thinks why should i do all the

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.240
work

00:15:41.759 --> 00:15:45.839
others are not doing she'll go back to

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.600
their states

00:15:45.839 --> 00:15:49.120
but those who are not working will not

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:51.040
think that this person is working let me

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:54.399
also work

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:56.320
it's other way around you see

00:15:54.399 --> 00:15:58.720
this can be an attitude of some people

00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:01.839
that if this person

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:06.079
is working let him work

00:16:01.839 --> 00:16:08.320
this is even a meaner stuff avoid just

00:16:06.079 --> 00:16:09.680
you go to a restaurant and somebody

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:12.639
takes out the purse others start looking

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:17.199
this side that's what you mean

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:18.560
i mean everybody should come forward

00:16:17.199 --> 00:16:20.399
and once you are paid you played it

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.880
finished then you just don't start

00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:26.160
counting

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:26.160
why did i pick once you try

00:16:26.399 --> 00:16:31.120
or any work has to be done go forward

00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:34.399
with it do it with your heart

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:36.079
don't worry if others have not done it

00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:37.920
just do it for its pleasure and the

00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:39.839
pleasure only you will get

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.680
well you will do it with the

00:16:39.839 --> 00:16:43.040
understanding that it's a training

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.600
period you are better trained than the

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.600
other one is

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.000
you are at a higher class than the other

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:53.120
one so we have to

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.120
be at a higher class

00:16:53.759 --> 00:17:00.240
for that this is just a training on

00:16:56.959 --> 00:17:03.279
and that's how we can really

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:04.079
put our preparation into practice into

00:17:03.279 --> 00:17:07.280
all details

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:10.079
to see how we work out our ego

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.799
and superego today in the morning i have

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:14.160
told you that

00:17:10.799 --> 00:17:17.199
your intellect must

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.000
imbibe this within itself all right and

00:17:17.199 --> 00:17:22.319
now i'm telling

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.319
you that your action

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:27.439
action that you do must

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:36.000
be every time branded by you as

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.000
just your training

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:42.480
any action you do sometimes you have to

00:17:39.919 --> 00:17:44.559
drive for miles together

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:46.080
you're trying your patience you see them

00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:46.480
doing everything say they have to do go

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.440
for

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:51.360
say helicopter or say if they have to

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:55.120
drop from the

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.120
what you call them drop down

00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:00.480
parachutes or helicopter you take away

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.960
or whatever it is

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.760
you go on doing it again and again isn't

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.760
it

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.440
you practice it again you drop many

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:09.520
times you break your legs you break your

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:12.400
hands you do this and do that

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:14.000
then you become a master you understand

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:16.320
my point

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.080
driving same way till you become a

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.000
master you go on in the same way

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:22.640
you are doing this work just to master

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.520
your patience

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.520
and that your love

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:31.679
is your love how much you love really

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:34.480
if you really love someone you are never

00:18:31.679 --> 00:18:34.480
tired of working

00:18:37.039 --> 00:18:41.440
you are never upset with working but if

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.679
you don't love

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.799
you start counting how much money how

00:18:43.679 --> 00:18:48.480
much work

00:18:44.799 --> 00:18:50.799
how many hours how much to be paid

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:53.919
all artificiality comes because there is

00:18:50.799 --> 00:18:53.919
no love involved in you

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:58.000
whatever you don't want to do you don't

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.000
do it

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:03.600
to begin with to begin with you just

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:07.280
don't do what you don't like

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:08.240
to begin with but once you have mastered

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.480
that

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:13.600
then you have to master it that you do

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.600
something that you don't like

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:18.080
like meeting some buddhist for example

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:21.840
you don't want to meet

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:24.400
you want to run but you go little nearer

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.520
you see then develop a immunity for

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:28.720
these buddhis

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.720
after some time will not cast

00:19:29.679 --> 00:19:33.760
you have to develop the immunity isn't

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:38.000
it otherwise one person comes and

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:40.000
everybody's head goes out

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
it's not the fellow improving you all go

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.799
out

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.919
so all these things are all these events

00:19:44.799 --> 00:19:49.280
are for your

00:19:45.919 --> 00:19:49.280
training your immunity

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:55.679
your immunity is to be trained

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:59.440
and when it is so when we are training

00:19:55.679 --> 00:19:59.440
ourselves we should take it as a job

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:06.960
but the attitude should be extremely

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:10.400
positive

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:13.760
extremely positive and

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:18.000
all that is should be expressed in your

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:21.200
notebook whether you got dejected

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:24.000
or you got upset and disgusted you want

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:27.919
to run away from it all sorts of things

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.919
it's just a training to your mind

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.799
whatever is the situation wherever one

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:38.000
has to live

00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:41.679
whatever one has to do

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:45.200
you should do whatever may be the

00:20:41.679 --> 00:20:45.200
circumstances conditions

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.880
you'll be amazed you will not even know

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.320
what you have eaten in the morning what

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.000
you have it means

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.600
whether you are eaten or not you will

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.799
not

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.799
you will not fuss about it

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:02.559
do not worry about it you will not think

00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:06.159
about it

00:21:02.559 --> 00:21:06.159
but this being

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:16.080
the a is to reach the satavura

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:16.880
every other thing becomes 0. the

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.360
greatest

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:22.720
hurdle comes to sahaja yogis i've seen

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.720
when they start organizing

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:27.360
they start organizing something now

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:29.919
somebody wants something

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:31.200
so they'll run up to get the thing for

00:21:29.919 --> 00:21:33.280
that person

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.960
now just have said that you must look

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:36.880
after the needs of others

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.960
but if i'm sitting here and there's a

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:41.600
lecture on then you better be

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.640
just listening to me you see this also

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:45.120
is

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:46.480
that how to have your prayers at this

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:49.600
time one

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:52.240
something working on you

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:54.159
this is the first thing you have to do

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.640
not that at this time you go

00:21:54.159 --> 00:21:56.640
and cook

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:02.640
you have known the story of two sisters

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:06.640
attending on christ

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:09.760
all right so at this time

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:13.280
what is your first job is to try

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:15.200
to be more exposed to me

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.400
so that automatically you go into your

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:21.760
subtotal

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:24.080
this is the best but if i am not there

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:26.480
and when you are alone or when we are

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:30.159
with other sahaja yogis

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:31.200
you must now compete in rising higher

00:22:30.159 --> 00:22:33.280
and higher

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:35.679
from tamaguna to rajaguna and from

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:37.760
rajaguna to sato

00:22:35.679 --> 00:22:39.039
but actually by realization you have

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:43.520
gone beyond

00:22:39.039 --> 00:22:46.880
these three ones you have gone beyond it

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.880
actually that is what has happened

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:52.559
but like clouds they cover you again and

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.559
again

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:57.280
and when the sky is covered with those

00:22:55.679 --> 00:22:59.520
clouds

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:03.120
you cannot see the sun you cannot see

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:03.120
the moon you cannot see the stars

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.720
so we have to know how these clouds are

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.960
coming into us

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:10.400
and that's how we go into our complete

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:12.960
analysis

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:14.240
how these clouds are coming to us we

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:17.760
find out about our

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:20.400
different chakras what are the chakras

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.400
we are catching

00:23:21.039 --> 00:23:25.280
here comes the another constant

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:28.480
attention

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:30.080
towards our channel are our vibrations

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:33.520
all right or not

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:36.320
why are we getting our vibrations

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:37.919
if not what chakra am i catching what

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:40.559
must be the catch

00:23:37.919 --> 00:23:42.400
i must raise my kundalini see for myself

00:23:40.559 --> 00:23:45.039
where is the catch

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:47.120
do i do my meditation or not if i do it

00:23:45.039 --> 00:23:50.480
am i doing it just dozingly or

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:53.039
am i really in it am i

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.919
really feeling it or not am i alert or

00:23:53.039 --> 00:23:57.360
not

00:23:53.919 --> 00:24:00.240
all this is to be assiduously

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:02.080
sincerely absolutely truthfully should

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:05.279
be worked out

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:07.840
because it is a process between

00:24:05.279 --> 00:24:07.840
yourselves

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.840
see it's a very funny it is so funny

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:20.960
relationship

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:20.960
that it is satisfied with happening

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:26.480
you have to be satisfied with yourself

00:24:24.559 --> 00:24:28.400
there's nobody mataji is not concerned

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:33.840
nobody is concerned it is you

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:33.840
are concerned with yourself

00:24:34.159 --> 00:24:36.240
you
