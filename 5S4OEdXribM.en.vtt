Shri Ganesha Puja. Cabella Ligure (Italy), 10 September 1995.

00:00:08.836 --> 00:00:13.192
With all the Ganapatis sitting around me

00:00:13.352 --> 00:00:17.211
and you all the ganas sitting in front of me,

00:00:17.453 --> 00:00:20.437
I don’t know what to say.

00:00:22.953 --> 00:00:26.660
It’s remarkable, very remarkable,

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.598
because most of you come from a culture

00:00:31.758 --> 00:00:35.528
which has never shown any respect of Shri Ganesh.

00:00:35.688 --> 00:00:39.626
They never realised how important it was that,

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:43.975
without Shri Ganesha’s qualities,

00:00:45.648 --> 00:00:50.719
we cannot achieve anything in our life.

00:00:53.063 --> 00:01:00.930
The idea of everyday, moment-to-moment enjoyment has destroyed them.

00:01:01.281 --> 00:01:06.594
And also the desire to know the Divine

00:01:15.436 --> 00:01:18.508
vanishes also in the thin air

00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:25.063
because you get lost into this moment-to-moment enjoyment

00:01:26.305 --> 00:01:30.531
till you get destructive, completely destroyed.

00:01:31.156 --> 00:01:39.859
But I really don’t understand how you have achieved this state

00:01:40.164 --> 00:01:44.930
where you see [that] the purity is so important to life;

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:53.890
that Ganesha’s qualities, His value system

00:01:55.296 --> 00:02:00.161
and His innocence are to be imbibed.

00:02:04.418 --> 00:02:14.508
I feel very gratified that such a thing has happened now in your lives

00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:20.453
and you all are so much in praise for Shri Ganesha.

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:28.972
Shri Ganesha is there from our childhood.

00:02:29.132 --> 00:02:33.059
Yesterday you saw the children, how they were so beautiful

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.731
and entertained us the most.

00:02:35.891 --> 00:02:39.168
Everybody had a smile on their face and I said,

00:02:39.328 --> 00:02:44.154
“Don’t laugh,” because if you laugh they feel a little offended

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:48.055
and they think that you are laughing at them.

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:59.227
The enjoyment that we had from that drama of children

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:05.777
was more than what one would expect

00:03:05.937 --> 00:03:11.047
from adults doing that kind of a drama just to entertain us.

00:03:11.207 --> 00:03:17.071
It might be some sort of a very subtle joy of Shri Ganesha

00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:19.528
that made us so happy.

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:26.165
We all have Shri Ganesh settled very nicely within ourselves

00:03:26.325 --> 00:03:33.130
and, in you, awakened; awakened in such a manner

00:03:34.067 --> 00:03:38.993
that, in your free will also, you do not want to do things

00:03:39.153 --> 00:03:43.075
that will go against Shri Ganesha.

00:03:44.145 --> 00:03:49.571
His manifestation within you is so evident.

00:03:49.731 --> 00:03:54.911
you see your faces – they are so beautifully shining,

00:03:55.356 --> 00:03:57.903
so very different from other people.

00:03:58.996 --> 00:04:02.364
One day I was travelling from London

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.750
and there was one Indian lady who came to see me and she said,

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.133
“I was surprised to see your disciples. Their faces were shining

00:04:14.293 --> 00:04:22.035
with such light. I have never seen any disciples like that.”

00:04:22.707 --> 00:04:27.586
I asked her, “Who are you?”

00:04:27.746 --> 00:04:31.617
She said, “I am married in Guru Nanak’s family

00:04:31.882 --> 00:04:37.399
and all the people in his family are just the opposite

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:40.434
[of] what Guru Nanak was.”

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.934
So I said, “Because they worship Shri Ganesha.”

00:04:47.989 --> 00:04:53.352
So she said that, “In our family nobody worships Shri Ganesh.”

00:04:53.512 --> 00:04:56.707
I said, “It cannot be possible! How is it?”

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:05.356
They believe in nirakar, in the formless God of chaitanya.

00:05:06.457 --> 00:05:10.379
I said, “But who is the source of that chaitanya?

00:05:10.723 --> 00:05:13.532
Why don’t they find out who is the source?”

00:05:13.692 --> 00:05:18.625
So they said that Nanaka has only talked up to this point.

00:05:18.785 --> 00:05:21.551
He’s not talked about the source.

00:05:25.121 --> 00:05:28.075
I said, “Better find out,

00:05:28.621 --> 00:05:33.000
because in this book maybe some things have been taken away.”

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.860
And then somebody gave me a passage where he had described

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.981
the innocence, the Deity of Shri Ganesha also.

00:05:44.043 --> 00:05:50.762
He had described that the whole Creation was done by the Mother

00:05:51.106 --> 00:05:52.735
and not by the Father.

00:05:52.895 --> 00:05:55.829
It’s very surprising because nirakaris,

00:05:55.989 --> 00:06:01.250
those people, who don’t believe in the forms of God,

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.696
always talk of Father, not of the Mother.

00:06:04.856 --> 00:06:16.465
It is true also about Christianity, also about Islam,

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:21.543
also about the Jews.

00:06:22.598 --> 00:06:27.977
All of them, they talk of the Father and not of the Mother,

00:06:28.137 --> 00:06:30.535
nor about Shri Ganesh.

00:06:32.316 --> 00:06:39.704
It seems, in the ancient times they believed in child God,

00:06:39.864 --> 00:06:47.524
even in China, even in Greece and also in many other countries

00:06:47.684 --> 00:06:53.325
who were supposed to be primitive. But they all believed in the child God.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.961
So now, when we deal with our children,

00:07:01.121 --> 00:07:07.008
we should know that they are just like Shri Ganesh:

00:07:07.168 --> 00:07:11.449
they are very innocent, very simple;

00:07:11.887 --> 00:07:17.469
except in cases sometimes [where] they are affected by some things

00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:20.324
and they lose their moorings.

00:07:24.184 --> 00:07:31.196
But Shri Ganesha’s greatest contribution to Sahaja Yoga is

00:07:31.356 --> 00:07:36.262
that He makes you feel My vibrations.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:43.997
He makes you feel the beauty of purity and simplicity.

00:07:44.793 --> 00:07:49.137
[It’s] only possible if Shri Ganesha is awakened within you.

00:07:50.417 --> 00:07:56.391
Also the Kundalini won’t rise without the sanction of this ‘chancellor’.

00:07:56.551 --> 00:07:59.848
He’s the one sitting on Mooladhara.

00:08:00.621 --> 00:08:04.277
But you should know He is on every chakra.

00:08:05.387 --> 00:08:14.844
Innocence cures all the maladies, physical, mental, emotional,

00:08:15.004 --> 00:08:17.277
specially the spiritual one.

00:08:18.317 --> 00:08:22.801
But Shri Ganesha’s quality, the most important, is

00:08:24.512 --> 00:08:28.856
that He believes in emitting vibrations,

00:08:29.637 --> 00:08:36.387
He believes in projecting His vibrations to everyone.

00:08:37.262 --> 00:08:46.145
That is the quality now [that] I feel all of you, as Sahaja Yogis, can use.

00:08:47.731 --> 00:08:54.853
You got your Realisation without any effort I should say.

00:08:55.013 --> 00:08:56.707
It was Sahaj.

00:08:57.332 --> 00:09:03.836
The life before Self-realisation was different.

00:09:03.996 --> 00:09:06.351
You got your transformation

00:09:06.511 --> 00:09:16.402
and you have jumped into the new era of Meta Science.

00:09:17.438 --> 00:09:19.938
But here now we have to see

00:09:20.098 --> 00:09:25.188
whatever we have got, what are we to do with it?

00:09:25.348 --> 00:09:30.127
You, of course, know that you have to give Realisations to others,

00:09:30.287 --> 00:09:38.508
you have to cure people, you have to love them

00:09:38.668 --> 00:09:41.274
and you have to be compassionate

00:09:41.434 --> 00:09:49.235
but apart from that, now the deliberations about yourself have to start.

00:09:49.395 --> 00:09:54.040
That is through Shri Ganesha’s powers that are within you.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:10:03.647
You should see that you can emit your powers your energy to others.

00:10:03.818 --> 00:10:06.537
You can project it to others.

00:10:06.826 --> 00:10:14.849
Now, for example, If somebody comes to you, meets you,

00:10:15.935 --> 00:10:21.873
if you know how to deliberately project your energy.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:27.031
This is a new type of meditation you have to practise now:

00:10:27.191 --> 00:10:31.851
that to emit your energy, project your energy to others.

00:10:32.011 --> 00:10:35.382
You don’t have to say anything, you don’t have to talk

00:10:35.542 --> 00:10:40.039
but just feel deliberately – again I say deliberately.

00:10:40.199 --> 00:10:43.140
It’s not sahaj, it’s not spontaneous.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.484
This is what you have to practise,

00:10:45.644 --> 00:10:52.058
is to emit your energy of your innocence of Shri Ganesha to others

00:10:52.229 --> 00:10:57.811
so, when they see you, their innocence would be awakened.

00:10:58.685 --> 00:11:01.367
Now, for example, say

00:11:05.889 --> 00:11:11.411
we had some problems in London and Sahaj Yogis told me,

00:11:11.571 --> 00:11:15.328
“Mother, there are still some men are looking at us.”

00:11:15.488 --> 00:11:21.031
And some said that, “There are many women who are looking at us.”

00:11:21.191 --> 00:11:25.425
It was a mutual sort of a thing going on.

00:11:26.855 --> 00:11:34.644
I said, “You can project your energy in such a manner

00:11:35.535 --> 00:11:42.765
that that projection will stop all this kind of stupid behaviour of other people

00:11:42.925 --> 00:11:49.495
and also make them understand, respect you and feel your dignity.”

00:11:50.565 --> 00:11:52.496
Not very difficult.

00:11:52.847 --> 00:11:57.625
But, on the contrary, as the culture is

00:11:57.785 --> 00:12:03.590
to attract men and attract women it will diminish.

00:12:06.041 --> 00:12:08.914
The energy will diminish.

00:12:09.074 --> 00:12:16.027
When you feel your own dignity and serenity

00:12:17.128 --> 00:12:22.975
and [realise] that you are now Self-realised people,

00:12:23.135 --> 00:12:25.459
you are not ordinary people

00:12:25.619 --> 00:12:30.932
a kind of majestic personality develops within you.

00:12:31.674 --> 00:12:40.678
That majestic personality really can have a tremendous effect

00:12:40.838 --> 00:12:44.330
on the surrounding people – tremendous!

00:12:45.697 --> 00:12:49.451
It’s a kind of a deliberate projection you should start.

00:12:49.611 --> 00:12:55.507
I don’t know that side, that how to project it

00:12:55.667 --> 00:12:58.943
or how to deliberately do this.

00:12:59.103 --> 00:13:02.178
It’s just spontaneous with me, it just happens.

00:13:02.338 --> 00:13:05.795
But you can achieve it yourself with [a] little practice.

00:13:05.955 --> 00:13:18.131
Try to face such people, not with disdain or contempt,

00:13:18.291 --> 00:13:22.338
but just your majestic personality.

00:13:23.353 --> 00:13:27.197
This personality is here now, you see,

00:13:28.095 --> 00:13:31.837
is sitting in such a majestic manner

00:13:33.025 --> 00:13:39.123
and is also giving the vibrations to others.

00:13:39.283 --> 00:13:48.588
The whole figure is doing something suddenly to people.

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:55.717
To expect that the whole world will change spontaneously,

00:13:55.877 --> 00:13:59.080
I don’t think is alright.

00:13:59.385 --> 00:14:04.654
Because, you know, the world is so chaotic, full of so much chaos,

00:14:04.814 --> 00:14:08.181
so much ego, so much conditioning.

00:14:08.728 --> 00:14:15.998
But something within you can rise above others

00:14:16.158 --> 00:14:26.580
with your sense of dignity, with your complete Selfhood,

00:14:27.017 --> 00:14:29.248
where you stand with yourself.

00:14:29.408 --> 00:14:33.185
You are not to be rude, you are not to be egoistical,

00:14:33.345 --> 00:14:37.990
you need not say things if you don’t want to say anything.

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:46.197
Just that silent personality can emit such beautiful vibrations,

00:14:46.446 --> 00:14:51.464
which you have. You have stored up a lot of vibrations within yourself.

00:14:51.624 --> 00:14:58.233
And this storing up is showing on your faces, which I said are shining.

00:14:59.006 --> 00:15:01.844
But the innocence that you have,

00:15:02.727 --> 00:15:07.871
you have to be proud of it, very much proud of it.

00:15:08.031 --> 00:15:15.093
Even now sometimes you feel that people will say

00:15:15.253 --> 00:15:19.061
you are not properly dressed up

00:15:19.221 --> 00:15:22.597
or maybe you are ugly looking or all kinds of things

00:15:22.757 --> 00:15:25.863
that they expect every other person to be.

00:15:26.023 --> 00:15:29.057
It’s a funny thing that in this world

00:15:29.218 --> 00:15:32.566
all human beings expect others to be very good.

00:15:32.726 --> 00:15:35.043
Everybody should be a hero or something

00:15:35.203 --> 00:15:37.894
– what about themselves they never think!

00:15:38.054 --> 00:15:41.246
So now you have become heroes in the sense that

00:15:41.406 --> 00:15:45.309
spiritually you are much higher than all of them.

00:15:45.469 --> 00:15:50.926
So this projection, when it starts – I am saying again ‘deliberate’ –

00:15:51.086 --> 00:15:55.777
then you should not be afraid that, “I will develop my ego.”

00:15:55.937 --> 00:15:58.980
You should not be afraid that, “I’ll get some conditionings.”

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:04.598
But just, in the way, with the understanding,

00:16:04.758 --> 00:16:10.863
that you have these powers within you, beautifully expressing themselves,

00:16:11.023 --> 00:16:12.992
as a child does.

00:16:13.445 --> 00:16:19.121
If there is one child, it can entertain at least hundred people.

00:16:19.281 --> 00:16:23.473
What is so sweet about the child? Is the innocence:

00:16:23.633 --> 00:16:29.402
the way he speaks, the way he talks, the way he behaves,

00:16:29.562 --> 00:16:33.949
the way he expresses his love. It’s so simple

00:16:34.109 --> 00:16:42.554
but it has something in the essence, this innocence of Shri Ganesha.

00:16:43.062 --> 00:16:48.465
Anywhere there’s a question of children,

00:16:48.625 --> 00:16:52.609
the whole world get worried about it,

00:16:52.867 --> 00:16:56.707
the whole world wants to solve the problem.

00:16:56.867 --> 00:17:03.043
If a child is in trouble, anywhere all over the world

00:17:03.203 --> 00:17:07.191
it will be circulated that such and such a thing is happening

00:17:07.351 --> 00:17:11.434
to such a child and everybody will be worried.

00:17:11.594 --> 00:17:17.340
If they see a child anywhere, the faces change;

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.934
you see the faces, the expression changes, automatically.

00:17:22.094 --> 00:17:26.461
Because that child is emitting that innocence;

00:17:26.976 --> 00:17:35.238
without any deliberations, without any special way of doing it,

00:17:35.398 --> 00:17:37.757
but just spontaneously.

00:17:38.625 --> 00:17:45.840
But then you grow, you start growing, growing with others

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.738
who are also not innocent. You have to meet them.

00:17:49.898 --> 00:17:52.738
You can’t run away from the society.

00:17:52.898 --> 00:18:00.789
You start getting all the rapport with such people

00:18:01.148 --> 00:18:05.536
who are talking about things

00:18:05.696 --> 00:18:09.691
– actually, those who are criticising Shri Ganesha.

00:18:09.851 --> 00:18:13.859
Gradually, your innocence starts dying out

00:18:15.312 --> 00:18:19.098
and you feel sometimes inferior to all those

00:18:19.258 --> 00:18:25.102
who are supposed to be very great warriors against innocence.

00:18:26.984 --> 00:18:33.871
In the sense that – when I was in London

00:18:34.031 --> 00:18:38.465
I saw they all used to laugh at me because I had this kumkum.

00:18:38.625 --> 00:18:42.465
But I used to think they don’t know why I am wearing it.

00:18:42.625 --> 00:18:44.593
So, it’s so ignorant they are:

00:18:44.754 --> 00:18:48.348
very ignorant people that they don’t know in India

00:18:48.508 --> 00:18:51.473
all the married women have to wear this.

00:18:51.633 --> 00:18:56.957
Even the Muslims wear that; they also wear mangalsutra.

00:18:57.117 --> 00:18:58.699
So I said that,

00:18:58.859 --> 00:19:03.215
“This is just written down, on my head, that I am a married woman.”

00:19:03.375 --> 00:19:06.668
It’s just to tell people ‘don’t bother me.

00:19:06.828 --> 00:19:13.078
I have got my husband behind me and he can take you to task.’

00:19:14.101 --> 00:19:19.012
This kind of ignorance is so much in the West

00:19:19.172 --> 00:19:24.277
and still they think they are a higher race, they are greater people.

00:19:24.437 --> 00:19:28.976
They don’t know even small, small things about life.

00:19:29.523 --> 00:19:32.785
For the innocence, I think

00:19:32.945 --> 00:19:38.015
they have lost any knowledge about it, long time back.

00:19:40.171 --> 00:19:44.301
And that’s how it is a society, today,

00:19:44.461 --> 00:19:50.746
which has absolutely lost its own moorings.

00:19:50.906 --> 00:19:52.762
Every individual is separate,

00:19:52.922 --> 00:19:57.176
every individual is doing something and they don’t know each other.

00:19:57.336 --> 00:20:03.543
Without innocence you cannot have a rapport with other people.

00:20:03.703 --> 00:20:07.957
Because that means you have some sort of a lust

00:20:08.117 --> 00:20:11.402
or greed behind the whole thing.

00:20:11.562 --> 00:20:17.059
So much so now, it’s become so boring the whole thing,

00:20:17.219 --> 00:20:22.598
that even once I told this Sahaj Yogi that, if you are going there,

00:20:22.758 --> 00:20:26.113
there’s a family and they have a daughter,

00:20:26.273 --> 00:20:31.117
so just give this present to her – a simple thing!

00:20:32.234 --> 00:20:37.105
Now this yogi was quite an elderly person, not a young boy.

00:20:37.265 --> 00:20:40.590
He said, “Mother, I’d better not go.” I said, “Why?”

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:43.480
“Because they will misunderstand me.”

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.324
“What will they misunderstand?”

00:20:45.484 --> 00:20:49.551
“Why am I giving a present to this girl?”

00:20:49.711 --> 00:20:52.387
I said, “But it’s I am giving. What is the harm?”

00:20:52.547 --> 00:20:56.113
“No!” That’s the psychology. He was himself a psychologist.

00:20:56.273 --> 00:21:00.652
That’s the psychology. “So I cannot take this present for that girl!”

00:21:00.812 --> 00:21:05.551
I mean, I was [amazed]: for Indians, you don’t understand this kind of a fear.

00:21:05.711 --> 00:21:08.113
But then I noticed it’s too much

00:21:08.273 --> 00:21:12.176
that they don’t want to be with any woman,

00:21:12.336 --> 00:21:15.324
they don’t want to be alone with any woman.

00:21:15.484 --> 00:21:19.144
And they said Mother, “You don’t know these women!

00:21:19.304 --> 00:21:22.613
They will make a rape case out of us!” “But how?”

00:21:22.773 --> 00:21:32.285
“They do!” So the whole idea is to challenge the innocence of people.

00:21:32.445 --> 00:21:39.828
For that, I must say, they made this Freud into a god

00:21:40.078 --> 00:21:44.980
because of his writings. I don’t know how they accept, also, such writings.

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:47.207
I just can’t understand how they accept.

00:21:47.367 --> 00:21:52.937
Because I think they have no idea as to what they are.

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:57.957
Somebody asked me about Freud, “Then what did he say?

00:21:58.117 --> 00:22:01.613
Why are people so much against him? Why are you so against?”

00:22:01.773 --> 00:22:06.371
I said, “He said that there’s a bad relationship between the mother and the son.”

00:22:06.531 --> 00:22:12.199
He just jumped. “He said so? My goodness! Thank God he never came to India,

00:22:12.359 --> 00:22:17.629
otherwise we would have cut him into pieces and put them in the Indian Sea!”

00:22:17.789 --> 00:22:22.859
I said, “But why spoil the purity of Indian Sea also?”

00:22:24.835 --> 00:22:27.783
He was so annoyed and angry, he said,

00:22:27.943 --> 00:22:30.112
“How could they tolerate such a nonsense?

00:22:30.272 --> 00:22:33.566
How could they accept such nonsense against the mother?

00:22:33.726 --> 00:22:38.012
They have no purity?” I said, “That’s the trouble with them.”

00:22:38.172 --> 00:22:41.202
Now the trouble is that the brain developed too much,

00:22:41.362 --> 00:22:46.077
ego developed too much and any such stupid idea

00:22:46.529 --> 00:22:51.703
– it’s much worse than stupid – was accepted.

00:22:51.863 --> 00:22:55.871
And that is how I find it’s so boring:

00:22:56.031 --> 00:23:04.124
every time anywhere you go it’s nothing but this sex business.

00:23:04.284 --> 00:23:08.191
It’s too much. I can’t understand how people go on tolerating.

00:23:08.351 --> 00:23:14.204
It’s alright, at the most, in some adult films you might show some nonsense,

00:23:14.364 --> 00:23:18.168
but every time you see something you find

00:23:18.328 --> 00:23:22.832
suddenly this kind of nonsensical scene is coming,

00:23:22.992 --> 00:23:26.559
this bedroom scenes, these scenes, and people like it.

00:23:26.719 --> 00:23:33.867
They pay for it. They want to have all aspects of it.

00:23:35.117 --> 00:23:40.145
It is such a natural thing. What is there to talk about it all the time?

00:23:40.305 --> 00:23:42.309
I don’t understand.

00:23:42.469 --> 00:23:46.551
It’s only the development of the brain, of such a manner,

00:23:46.711 --> 00:23:49.996
that every kind of nonsense it wants to accept.

00:23:50.156 --> 00:23:52.176
“So what? What’s wrong?”

00:23:52.336 --> 00:23:56.121
“Well, you’re mad! That’s what. You go to lunatic asylum.”

00:23:56.281 --> 00:23:59.926
Lunatics also talk like that. “So what’s wrong?”

00:24:00.086 --> 00:24:05.355
Same way. Because of such acceptance, they don’t know how much

00:24:05.515 --> 00:24:10.441
people have ruined their family life, their children’s life.

00:24:10.601 --> 00:24:16.746
In every way, we find that the whole society is full of this nonsense

00:24:16.906 --> 00:24:21.707
and specially in the television – Italy specially.

00:24:21.867 --> 00:24:27.305
I mean, certain buttons you should not press,

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:29.965
you should be very careful,

00:24:30.125 --> 00:24:32.901
otherwise you don’t know what you face and you go for vomiting.

00:24:33.061 --> 00:24:37.211
You see, as Indians – first reaction is to vomit.

00:24:38.687 --> 00:24:47.254
But for people who have not yet realized the value of this innocence

00:24:47.414 --> 00:24:53.641
can be easily taken up by this kind of nonsense that’s going on.

00:24:56.172 --> 00:25:00.434
Whatever it is, through the blessings of Shri Ganesha,

00:25:00.594 --> 00:25:07.828
you are all transformed. You are on a different line.

00:25:08.906 --> 00:25:13.980
Yesterday these two musicians were surprised how you were praising Ganesha.

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:18.066
They couldn’t believe it, how you could praise Shri Ganesh,

00:25:18.226 --> 00:25:22.590
because you haven’t even heard the name of Shri Ganesha before

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:27.488
I said, “They see what Shri Ganesha has done to them,

00:25:27.648 --> 00:25:32.644
how He has made their attention so beautiful

00:25:32.804 --> 00:25:36.980
that they enjoy all the beautiful things of the world,

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:40.476
all the innocent things of the world.”

00:25:40.812 --> 00:25:45.535
And there are many people like them, I can tell you, who are struggling.

00:25:45.695 --> 00:25:48.895
Not that all the society has accepted this nonsense.

00:25:49.055 --> 00:25:50.621
There are many who are struggling

00:25:50.781 --> 00:25:56.098
because I know in England they published a book about what children have to say

00:25:56.258 --> 00:26:00.147
about the politicians: very sweet, sweet things, very sweet.

00:26:00.306 --> 00:26:03.854
And those books [that] were published were five thousand books because

00:26:04.015 --> 00:26:07.301
if you publish five thousand, you get it cheaper or something like that.

00:26:07.461 --> 00:26:12.039
And in one day all the books were sold out – in one day.

00:26:13.773 --> 00:26:17.934
That shows that there are so many people still

00:26:18.094 --> 00:26:23.629
who are respecting their innocence and they want to be innocent

00:26:23.789 --> 00:26:25.388
and they want to enjoy it.

00:26:25.548 --> 00:26:28.887
But a society has to be created of that kind.

00:26:29.047 --> 00:26:34.277
For that, you must have a kind of a personality.

00:26:34.437 --> 00:26:41.648
You know that I was in London and once I went to Greece.

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:44.865
And the ministers’ wives also came to meet me.

00:26:45.025 --> 00:26:47.932
I was surprised. Normally they don’t do. So they said,

00:26:48.092 --> 00:26:53.020
“You see, our husbands told us if you want to see serenity personified,

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:56.961
then you must see Mrs. Shrivastava.”

00:26:57.469 --> 00:27:01.746
I was surprised [that] in Greece they are talking of serenity!

00:27:01.906 --> 00:27:06.465
In these modern times anybody talking about purity!

00:27:06.625 --> 00:27:10.340
I just couldn’t understand, but I felt at the back of their mind

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:17.059
their tradition, whatever it is, these men could see

00:27:17.219 --> 00:27:20.879
that simple thing in me and they went and told them.

00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:23.251
And they all enjoyed my company very much.

00:27:23.411 --> 00:27:26.496
I was making them laugh and telling them things and all that.

00:27:26.656 --> 00:27:29.012
And one of them then turned around and said,

00:27:29.172 --> 00:27:32.613
“Mrs. Shrivastava, you are just like a child!” “I said, “Really?”

00:27:32.773 --> 00:27:34.855
“No, we enjoyed your company so much!”

00:27:35.015 --> 00:27:37.684
And when I was coming, they were in tears.

00:27:37.844 --> 00:27:42.973
So what I am saying that: whatever innocent personality you have,

00:27:43.133 --> 00:27:46.809
you have to project now, to project towards others.

00:27:46.969 --> 00:27:50.707
Say somebody is trying to be funny with you

00:27:50.867 --> 00:27:53.699
just with one glance you can put that person right,

00:27:53.859 --> 00:27:59.199
that you don’t like it. Just to say you don’t like it.

00:27:59.359 --> 00:28:02.500
In a way that’s a projection.

00:28:03.375 --> 00:28:07.387
Around your society, around where you are working,

00:28:07.547 --> 00:28:12.691
you will also find people who have no sense of innocence.

00:28:12.851 --> 00:28:16.020
And it’s disgusting to be with them.

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:21.855
But as you have powers, you must use [them] – is to project.

00:28:22.015 --> 00:28:25.699
I see with Sahaja Yogis, they don’t even cure people.

00:28:25.859 --> 00:28:29.855
They’ll tell me, “Mother, he is to be cured. That is to be done.”

00:28:30.015 --> 00:28:33.121
But you are so many, why do you need me to do that now?

00:28:33.281 --> 00:28:37.066
You all can cure a patient. You can help the patient.

00:28:37.226 --> 00:28:41.582
Why can’t you do it? What is the need for me to do it?

00:28:41.742 --> 00:28:45.348
You have those qualities within you

00:28:45.508 --> 00:28:48.824
because potentially you had them before

00:28:48.984 --> 00:28:53.223
and now they are enlightened through the grace of Shri Ganesha.

00:28:53.383 --> 00:28:57.352
Now, what you have to do is to assert them.

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:04.746
In that, of course, you must remember not to use your ego,

00:29:04.906 --> 00:29:08.996
not to use your mind. So somebody would say that,

00:29:09.156 --> 00:29:13.816
“Mother, without mind how can you impress others?

00:29:13.976 --> 00:29:17.551
How can you have a rapport with others?” It’s very simple.

00:29:17.711 --> 00:29:21.387
Just go thoughtless. Once you are thoughtless,

00:29:21.547 --> 00:29:27.371
you are in the Realm of the Divine, and then the Divine takes charge.

00:29:27.531 --> 00:29:31.152
And it will start emitting such beautiful vibrations

00:29:31.312 --> 00:29:36.348
that you will be amazed at yourself how things are working out.

00:29:36.508 --> 00:29:39.977
It is not a coincidence we should say.

00:29:40.851 --> 00:29:45.902
Like once I was going somewhere and they told me that,

00:29:46.062 --> 00:29:49.488
“You have to be very careful!” I said, “Why?”

00:29:49.648 --> 00:29:53.191
“Because in the night, you see, these Naxalites (Indian communists) are here

00:29:53.351 --> 00:29:56.455
and they might just kill you.” I said, “It’s alright!”

00:29:56.615 --> 00:30:00.195
He said, “No, it’s very late. You be careful!”

00:30:01.281 --> 00:30:04.347
So, the gentleman with me was very much worried.

00:30:04.507 --> 00:30:06.809
He said, “You take out your ornaments, everything.”

00:30:06.969 --> 00:30:10.110
He put them under the seat and did all that.

00:30:11.336 --> 00:30:17.105
So, as soon as we reached that place where many Naxalites were standing

00:30:17.265 --> 00:30:21.038
with their lanterns and with their sticks,

00:30:22.515 --> 00:30:26.496
so I told the driver that, “For one minute you stop the car.”

00:30:26.656 --> 00:30:29.220
He said, “No, I will not!” “No, you stop!”

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:34.090
I looked at them and I don’t know what happened – they just moved on.

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:37.105
I said, “Now speed up the car.”

00:30:37.265 --> 00:30:39.551
You see, it is the power that you have.

00:30:39.711 --> 00:30:44.531
Unless and until you use this power of love and compassion,

00:30:44.828 --> 00:30:52.101
you will not know what you have got. And that comes from your Shri Ganesh.

00:30:52.367 --> 00:30:56.039
You see, how children understand love.

00:30:56.374 --> 00:31:01.952
If you are nice to them, how they react. Maybe sometimes they do not,

00:31:02.112 --> 00:31:07.890
but ninety-nine percent [of] children, I have seen, they really react to love.

00:31:08.367 --> 00:31:13.129
In our school in Dharamsala there were two children

00:31:13.289 --> 00:31:17.840
and they were very troublesome to begin with

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.787
and the parents were worried about them.

00:31:20.947 --> 00:31:23.289
They sent them to Dharamsala

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:28.324
and otherwise they were very demanding as the modern children are.

00:31:28.484 --> 00:31:31.996
“You buy this. You buy that. Go here. We want MacDonald!”

00:31:32.156 --> 00:31:36.707
This, that was going on. When they went to the school for one year,

00:31:36.867 --> 00:31:39.684
they came back and the parents asked them,

00:31:39.844 --> 00:31:42.622
“Now, what do you want?” They said, “We don’t want anything!”

00:31:42.782 --> 00:31:45.772
“You don’t want anything? You want to go to MacDonald’s?”

00:31:45.932 --> 00:31:48.793
They were American. “No, no, we don’t want to go to MacDonald.

00:31:48.953 --> 00:31:54.836
We want to sit here and watch Mother’s videos.”

00:31:56.117 --> 00:31:58.834
They said, “Suddenly, what has happened to them? They were so troublesome.

00:31:58.994 --> 00:32:03.699
Why are they now so much changed? What’s the matter with them?”

00:32:03.859 --> 00:32:07.230
So then they said, “What about food? Whatever you cook, we’ll eat.

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:08.598
We are not bothered.”

00:32:08.758 --> 00:32:11.637
And they were amazed how these children had changed!

00:32:11.797 --> 00:32:14.059
But then they said, “We must go out somewhere.

00:32:14.219 --> 00:32:16.770
We must see the river, we must see the mountain.”

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:20.809
“Alright, that we’ll do.” Then again they came home

00:32:20.969 --> 00:32:24.934
– no demands, nothing. They didn’t want to go for any shopping

00:32:25.094 --> 00:32:28.927
or asking for any shirts or blouse or nothing.

00:32:29.087 --> 00:32:34.235
Very much satisfied, dignified.

00:32:35.172 --> 00:32:39.622
So they said, “What’s the matter with you? You don’t want anything?”

00:32:39.782 --> 00:32:42.543
“No we want something but we don’t know how to tell you.”

00:32:42.703 --> 00:32:45.445
“What is it?” “Because you don’t have that.

00:32:45.605 --> 00:32:48.228
You can’t get it in the market.” “Well, what is it?”

00:32:48.388 --> 00:32:52.957
They said, “Can you get us a pendant of Shri Mataji?”

00:32:53.117 --> 00:32:56.594
So sweetly, you know, they said. That’s all.

00:32:57.102 --> 00:32:59.504
But they said, “You don’t have?” “No, we don’t have any.”

00:32:59.664 --> 00:33:03.286
“So you just get us the pendant of Shri Mataji, that’s all.”

00:33:03.446 --> 00:33:11.256
I mean so deep expression. You don’t want anything else.

00:33:12.039 --> 00:33:14.965
I mean, I know the children, I have met them,

00:33:15.125 --> 00:33:17.325
but I have not been with them for a long time,

00:33:17.485 --> 00:33:19.835
I have never been so close to them, nothing,

00:33:19.995 --> 00:33:24.313
but look at the love that they have.

00:33:24.539 --> 00:33:27.825
And they were telling me in the school in the beginning

00:33:27.985 --> 00:33:30.903
that anybody goes to trouble us, we said,

00:33:31.063 --> 00:33:33.114
“Now we are going to inform Shri Mataji!”

00:33:33.274 --> 00:33:36.356
“No, no, no, don’t inform Her.” “Why?”

00:33:36.516 --> 00:33:40.926
“Because She will not love me any more!” Can you imagine?

00:33:41.086 --> 00:33:47.700
The value of my love is so much understood by these little, little children

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:53.997
and so much they admire, they want it.

00:33:54.157 --> 00:34:00.082
It has no material gain by that, nothing.

00:34:00.242 --> 00:34:05.060
All this really shows that Christ as He has said it, that,

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:09.187
“You have to be like small children to enter into the Kingdom of God.”

00:34:09.347 --> 00:34:12.676
Without that, you cannot enjoy anything.

00:34:12.836 --> 00:34:16.840
Like yesterday’s programme was really, I must say

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.689
– these Swiss have worked very hard.

00:34:18.849 --> 00:34:21.661
They are very hard working I know, but not to this extent

00:34:21.821 --> 00:34:27.532
that they started singing Indian music so well in such a combination

00:34:28.938 --> 00:34:31.918
and we enjoyed all that very much.

00:34:32.078 --> 00:34:38.594
Now imagine these Swiss who are overactive, always working,

00:34:40.093 --> 00:34:45.559
they have no time to think about creating something innocent,

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:50.571
creating something sweet of this kind.

00:34:50.782 --> 00:34:55.676
And the way they did it shows, really, that they love Shri Ganesha

00:34:55.836 --> 00:35:02.848
and they understand the value of Shri Ganesha’s manifestation in them.

00:35:03.008 --> 00:35:07.786
I was really surprised how they could learn all this Indian music

00:35:07.946 --> 00:35:11.371
and so many sitting together and singing that song.

00:35:11.531 --> 00:35:14.575
And there were some Indians, I said, “Can you sing like this?”

00:35:14.735 --> 00:35:17.293
They said, “No.” I said, “Look at these Swiss.”

00:35:17.453 --> 00:35:21.582
This is the power of Shri Ganesha’s love.

00:35:21.742 --> 00:35:26.606
Because they were to celebrate Shri Ganesha’s birthday,

00:35:26.766 --> 00:35:31.161
so they got equipped from within.

00:35:31.321 --> 00:35:35.887
But if they had not projected it there would have been nothing.

00:35:36.047 --> 00:35:39.770
So whatever He is giving you, whatever He is creating in you,

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:47.254
this beautiful innocence, this beautiful fragrance of your living,

00:35:47.414 --> 00:35:50.184
every moment, when you are enjoying it,

00:35:50.344 --> 00:35:53.434
also know that we have to give it to others.

00:35:53.594 --> 00:35:57.957
We have to pour this into others.

00:35:58.117 --> 00:36:01.442
And it will work out, I know it will work out.

00:36:01.602 --> 00:36:05.395
It is so tremendous. His powers are so tremendous.

00:36:05.555 --> 00:36:10.723
Yesterday you saw that in the children’s program

00:36:10.883 --> 00:36:15.668
that nobody could beat him, even Shiva, anyone.

00:36:15.828 --> 00:36:19.934
And Shiva had to cut His head

00:36:20.094 --> 00:36:24.582
because He didn’t know how to overpower Him otherwise.

00:36:24.742 --> 00:36:30.604
This is what we have to understand, that if you are innocent,

00:36:30.764 --> 00:36:34.786
nobody can cheat us, nobody can trouble us,

00:36:34.946 --> 00:36:39.395
because in innocence you become a person

00:36:39.555 --> 00:36:42.965
who doesn’t care for what is happening to you.

00:36:43.125 --> 00:36:47.263
You become a person who tolerates everything thinking these are…

00:36:47.423 --> 00:36:53.032
you don’t even think, you feel they are something, stupid people, that’s all.

00:36:53.836 --> 00:36:59.645
It is a story about a king in China, as I am going to China.

00:36:59.805 --> 00:37:01.215
There was a king in China.

00:37:01.375 --> 00:37:05.036
They are very wise people, I must say Chinese are extremely wise.

00:37:05.196 --> 00:37:15.536
And he decided to win a cocks’ fight. It’s a cocks’ fight.

00:37:15.696 --> 00:37:19.969
Imagine the king thinking like that! But it’s all child’s play.

00:37:20.555 --> 00:37:23.926
So he went to one great saint and told him that,

00:37:24.086 --> 00:37:29.059
“How will you train a cock to fight the other cocks?”

00:37:29.219 --> 00:37:31.161
He said, “Leave the cock with me.”

00:37:31.321 --> 00:37:37.200
So he left the cock there and he trained him very well

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:41.952
because when the king arrived after one month before the fight,

00:37:42.112 --> 00:37:44.788
he said, “See now, take this cock it’s your one.”

00:37:44.948 --> 00:37:48.788
He said, “This one? This one is not doing anything, just standing straight.

00:37:48.948 --> 00:37:52.522
He said, “Yes, yes. That’s it. You take it.”

00:37:52.682 --> 00:38:00.627
So he took that cock and put him in that contest.

00:38:00.963 --> 00:38:04.065
So all the cocks were together.

00:38:04.612 --> 00:38:08.811
They started troubling this cock, which was just standing like this as if,

00:38:08.971 --> 00:38:12.194
“Some stupid people are trying to trouble me.”

00:38:12.354 --> 00:38:15.424
He wouldn’t touch them, he wouldn’t react, nothing of the kind,

00:38:15.584 --> 00:38:17.686
he was just standing straight.

00:38:17.846 --> 00:38:22.350
So all the cocks were surprised that, “This one is not protesting.

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:27.671
He’s just bearing up everything and he’s not bothered as to what we are doing.”

00:38:27.831 --> 00:38:31.999
One by one all the cocks disappeared from the field

00:38:32.159 --> 00:38:35.678
where they were having these fights.

00:38:35.838 --> 00:38:40.151
And this was the only cock which stood up.

00:38:40.323 --> 00:38:46.014
So the king was surprised. He took him to the saint and he said,

00:38:46.174 --> 00:38:50.686
“This one has become a saint now. So it’s better you keep it with you!”

00:38:50.846 --> 00:38:55.052
He’s such a saint that they were all trying to trouble him and he was least bothered.

00:38:55.213 --> 00:38:58.437
He was looking like this, left side, right side, both sides.

00:38:58.597 --> 00:39:02.897
He thought, “What’s going on with these people? Why are they behaving like this?”

00:39:03.057 --> 00:39:07.639
So this is what I have to tell you that your personality itself

00:39:07.799 --> 00:39:13.401
is made like that and now you worship Him so much [that] He’s within you.

00:39:13.561 --> 00:39:22.995
And any kind of problems that you have will be really solved very easily

00:39:23.155 --> 00:39:26.218
if you take to your innocence.

00:39:26.647 --> 00:39:31.542
And that will create coincidences, as they call it.

00:39:31.702 --> 00:39:37.085
But I would say it’s not coincidence, it’s the vibrations.

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:41.049
And you’ll be amazed how things are solved.

00:39:41.209 --> 00:39:43.448
They’ll say, “Mother, this had happened, that had happened.”

00:39:43.608 --> 00:39:46.307
Now see, the other day, it rained so much.

00:39:46.467 --> 00:39:48.581
It rained so much so that they said,

00:39:48.741 --> 00:39:53.635
“It has become knee-deep mud here and Mother what are we to do?”

00:39:53.795 --> 00:39:56.032
I said, “It’s alright. Leave it to Him.”

00:39:56.192 --> 00:40:01.666
Next day it was very hot. Imagine underneath these things,

00:40:01.826 --> 00:40:07.866
the whole thing got dried out and today you are here for the puja.

00:40:08.397 --> 00:40:15.393
It’s an impossible thing that there could be such a change in the weather

00:40:15.553 --> 00:40:20.686
that one day it rains so heavily and second day

00:40:20.928 --> 00:40:24.698
the whole thing gets absolutely dried out.

00:40:24.858 --> 00:40:30.221
It’s His work, because He’s so much powerful.

00:40:30.381 --> 00:40:36.304
You have come to worship Him, so first of all cleansing has to be done

00:40:36.464 --> 00:40:41.548
and He did the cleansing by putting the rain here.

00:40:41.708 --> 00:40:46.596
It’s so heavy rains and some of the part of the rains

00:40:46.756 --> 00:41:00.351
which came near this Palazzo Dorio they turned into ice (hail).

00:41:00.511 --> 00:41:02.845
I don’t know what is English word is [for] that.

00:41:03.005 --> 00:41:08.002
So they all started and the whole thing went round the house.

00:41:08.162 --> 00:41:14.745
They were all forming into little, little ice-balls, falling nearby.

00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:21.016
Now it is something unbelievable that all over it has just rained

00:41:21.176 --> 00:41:24.758
only near our house it is the ice-balls are coming.

00:41:24.918 --> 00:41:28.555
We can call it ‘miracles’, we can call it anything,

00:41:28.715 --> 00:41:33.547
but it is Shri Ganesha’s, we should say, sensitivity

00:41:33.707 --> 00:41:38.031
that He thought that, “Now this rain is going near my Mother’s house,

00:41:38.191 --> 00:41:43.305
so let us make some sort of a beautiful ice-balls.”

00:41:43.465 --> 00:41:46.594
And I went out and I saw, and I was amazed

00:41:46.754 --> 00:41:51.203
how it was all around my house [that] there were ice-balls.

00:41:51.363 --> 00:41:58.910
What He can do, what he’s capable is absolutely unbelievable.

00:41:59.566 --> 00:42:02.662
How He guides you and how He helps you.

00:42:02.822 --> 00:42:05.067
How He takes you to [the] right path.

00:42:05.227 --> 00:42:07.676
Not only that [but] how He protects you.

00:42:07.836 --> 00:42:13.051
All the time He is with you because you have become His ganas now.

00:42:13.211 --> 00:42:17.645
You are His ganas, so He protects you, looks after you,

00:42:17.805 --> 00:42:22.770
gives you all the guidance. He takes you to the right path.

00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:27.137
He takes you to the righteous road.

00:42:27.297 --> 00:42:31.332
He gives you all that is dharmic to enjoy.

00:42:31.492 --> 00:42:34.043
You always meet friends here and there.

00:42:34.203 --> 00:42:36.457
You think it’s a coincidence – it is not.

00:42:36.617 --> 00:42:39.059
And that is how He works.

00:42:39.219 --> 00:42:48.793
He works with all His beautiful, sweet, loving attention on you

00:42:48.953 --> 00:42:51.434
because you are His ganas.

00:42:51.594 --> 00:42:54.477
But the ganas have to work!

00:42:55.820 --> 00:43:01.218
As I say that, in our body there are ganas

00:43:01.405 --> 00:43:09.863
and they fight the disease, they fight the problems that are in the body

00:43:10.023 --> 00:43:15.973
those antibodies which are the ganas of Shri Ganesha.

00:43:16.133 --> 00:43:19.043
In the same way, you are also His ganas.

00:43:19.203 --> 00:43:22.504
He does all this for you. He protects you, He loves you,

00:43:22.664 --> 00:43:25.578
He gives you all the good time.

00:43:26.523 --> 00:43:28.942
Then what are we doing about it?

00:43:29.102 --> 00:43:34.270
It should not be one-sided. When He does all this for you

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:38.032
then what should we do about Shri Ganesh?

00:43:38.594 --> 00:43:42.457
What can we do as antibodies?

00:43:42.617 --> 00:43:54.369
You don’t have to fight the enemies with any sword or any kind of a weapon.

00:43:54.971 --> 00:44:01.392
The enemies you can conquer by simple, two, methods.

00:44:01.579 --> 00:44:08.014
One is try your love, your pure love on them. Try that.

00:44:08.174 --> 00:44:10.600
You may melt away many people.

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:17.772
Or else, if that is not working, then what should you do

00:44:17.932 --> 00:44:22.584
is to sit down and meditate and give bandhans.

00:44:22.744 --> 00:44:26.340
There are ways of giving bandhans. The bandhan works so fast

00:44:26.501 --> 00:44:31.199
and so beautifully that you are amazed how it has worked!

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:34.058
Because you are so powerful.

00:44:34.219 --> 00:44:37.310
The way you give bandhan, [if] anybody else can give

00:44:37.471 --> 00:44:42.748
it is not going to work! It’s only you, the Sahaj Yogis, can give bandhan.

00:44:42.908 --> 00:44:46.178
There are different types of bandhans you have to give.

00:44:46.338 --> 00:44:50.342
And all that works out so well.

00:44:50.502 --> 00:44:54.022
So we have to have now faith in our own powers

00:44:54.182 --> 00:45:00.038
and we have to know that we are now empowered by Shri Ganesha

00:45:00.198 --> 00:45:03.221
to do the work of Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:03.478 --> 00:45:08.366
To do the work of Sahaja Yoga is not to feel that you are doing it,

00:45:08.526 --> 00:45:11.526
but it is Shri Ganesh who is doing it.

00:45:12.877 --> 00:45:16.327
You will be surprised – giving Realisations to people

00:45:16.487 --> 00:45:20.151
is the greatest joy Sahaja Yogis can have.

00:45:20.893 --> 00:45:24.780
And then you don’t have to think that you have done it

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:28.319
– then is the best – but if you think you have done it then,

00:45:28.479 --> 00:45:31.116
“I am very tired,” or “I have done this!”

00:45:31.276 --> 00:45:35.991
Many people come and tell me, “Mother, we have done this, we have done that!”

00:45:36.151 --> 00:45:41.355
That means they are just feeling the strain of doing any work.

00:45:42.659 --> 00:45:45.663
But you are not to feel any strain.

00:45:45.823 --> 00:45:50.069
His powers are within you, you can see it. Believe me!

00:45:50.229 --> 00:45:52.999
Believe in yourself. Have confidence in yourself

00:45:53.159 --> 00:45:55.444
– confidence and faith in yourself.

00:45:55.604 --> 00:46:00.561
And [know] that you are a storehouse of innocence

00:46:00.721 --> 00:46:04.455
which is nothing but compassion and love.

00:46:05.658 --> 00:46:07.538
If you have that faith

00:46:07.698 --> 00:46:13.034
you will definitely develop a beautiful way of talking to others,

00:46:14.572 --> 00:46:22.612
of having [a] relationship with others.

00:46:24.276 --> 00:46:31.760
It is something that is really a gift of Shri Ganesh.

00:46:32.830 --> 00:46:36.291
I don’t think I every shouted at anyone.

00:46:37.463 --> 00:46:41.155
Even on my children, I have never shouted, never.

00:46:41.315 --> 00:46:44.538
I have never got into a fury or a temper

00:46:44.698 --> 00:46:46.881
because I think I can manage without it.

00:46:47.041 --> 00:46:50.905
Of course, I had to correct, I had to tell people.

00:46:51.065 --> 00:46:55.983
But one thing I have seen [is] that everybody has been afraid of one thing

00:46:56.143 --> 00:47:00.569
– that somehow I should never drive out somebody from Sahaja Yoga,

00:47:00.729 --> 00:47:03.491
because Sahaja Yoga is such a joy,

00:47:03.651 --> 00:47:06.834
it is such an energy-giving thing,

00:47:06.994 --> 00:47:16.494
it is such a light that you feel absolutely confident about yourself.

00:47:17.947 --> 00:47:20.522
So to ask you to leave Sahaja Yoga

00:47:20.682 --> 00:47:26.772
is the greatest punishment because you can’t leave me now.

00:47:26.932 --> 00:47:31.553
It’s difficult. You just can’t leave me! It’s impossible!

00:47:31.713 --> 00:47:35.639
And that is what it is that you also develop those qualities

00:47:35.799 --> 00:47:37.666
that you can’t leave.

00:47:38.323 --> 00:47:43.913
See, a child, if it is lost, I mean, the parents just go off,

00:47:44.073 --> 00:47:46.096
they don’t know how the child is lost.

00:47:46.256 --> 00:47:52.531
But supposing, some son of theirs is a very bad boy,

00:47:52.691 --> 00:47:57.967
is misbehaving, is doing all kinds of wrong things, they don’t mind.

00:47:58.127 --> 00:48:00.819
But when they are young, they are innocent

00:48:00.979 --> 00:48:05.467
it’s some sort of a tremendous attachment to them

00:48:05.627 --> 00:48:11.006
and understanding that “They are our children, we have to look after them.”

00:48:11.166 --> 00:48:15.186
So [it’s] this innocence that attracts you,

00:48:15.346 --> 00:48:21.826
that keeps you wondering about your children, about other children.

00:48:21.986 --> 00:48:26.404
And I was very happy the way you gave a present to Guido

00:48:26.564 --> 00:48:30.233
because he’s doing a very difficult task, I must say.

00:48:30.393 --> 00:48:36.358
And this appreciation shows that to you it’s very valuable

00:48:36.518 --> 00:48:39.553
that your children are looked after.

00:48:39.713 --> 00:48:42.928
But you are also a child of your Mother.

00:48:43.088 --> 00:48:47.444
As a result, you have all these powers within yourself.

00:48:47.604 --> 00:48:53.834
But you must know how to smile. You must know how to win over people.

00:48:53.994 --> 00:48:57.436
Still there are some Sahaj Yogis and some Sahaj Yoginis

00:48:57.596 --> 00:49:02.397
who are still rather stiff! I find them little stiff type

00:49:02.557 --> 00:49:04.420
and they can’t give up their stiffness.

00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:07.936
Maybe they think no end of themselves or whatever it is.

00:49:08.096 --> 00:49:09.951
Then they will not enjoy Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:10.112 --> 00:49:13.595
Of course, mentally of course they understand Sahaj Yog and all that

00:49:13.756 --> 00:49:22.158
but they cannot enjoy fully Sahaj Yoga and all its mirth, its joyous moments.

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:27.069
Today is to celebrate His birth

00:49:27.229 --> 00:49:32.655
and He was the first God that was created on this Earth;

00:49:32.815 --> 00:49:38.682
because he’s also auspiciousness, he’s also Holiness.

00:49:39.338 --> 00:49:44.116
So the Primordial Mother didn’t want to create this world

00:49:44.276 --> 00:49:50.745
without first creating the holiness, the auspiciousness, the purity.

00:49:51.393 --> 00:49:54.659
And that’s why He was first created.

00:49:55.409 --> 00:50:00.522
Created on this Earth with vibrations, just [a] bundle of vibrations:

00:50:00.682 --> 00:50:04.073
so that He can look after all the people

00:50:04.487 --> 00:50:12.112
who are going to come from ages to ages,

00:50:12.534 --> 00:50:17.097
to guide them always on the right path.

00:50:17.283 --> 00:50:22.038
So He is supposed to be in charge of our conscience,

00:50:22.198 --> 00:50:26.366
the conscience that eats you up sometimes, that says,

00:50:26.526 --> 00:50:29.077
“This is not alright. This I should not have done.

00:50:29.237 --> 00:50:31.186
That I should have not done.”

00:50:31.346 --> 00:50:36.678
But one should try to take very great pride in it.

00:50:36.838 --> 00:50:40.022
Like there was one gentleman, an Indian

00:50:40.182 --> 00:50:43.514
– Indians can be exceptionally innocent sometimes, exceptionally,

00:50:43.674 --> 00:50:47.444
you can’t understand them! So I told him,

00:50:47.604 --> 00:50:51.303
“Why did you give up your land?”

00:50:51.463 --> 00:50:55.514
He said, “Mother, I thought that later on, when my children will grow,

00:50:55.674 --> 00:50:59.996
I might become greedy and I may not give this land to my brother,

00:51:00.156 --> 00:51:04.179
who deserves it because I’m too clever, I can cheat him.

00:51:04.339 --> 00:51:06.256
So I thought it’s better to give up.

00:51:06.416 --> 00:51:08.827
So I gave up the land to my brother.”

00:51:08.987 --> 00:51:13.182
And he so innocently was telling me that,

00:51:13.619 --> 00:51:19.389
“I should not become greedy because maybe that my children will grow up

00:51:19.549 --> 00:51:22.491
and I will feel that I must give all this to my children,

00:51:22.651 --> 00:51:26.889
so I decided to give up the land just now to my own brother.”

00:51:27.049 --> 00:51:28.895
But I said, “What about your brother?”

00:51:29.056 --> 00:51:32.541
He said, “He deserves, he needs. I don’t need so much land.

00:51:32.701 --> 00:51:35.631
I am doing very well in life. That’s why I have given.”

00:51:35.791 --> 00:51:40.014
“But legally?” “Legally,” he said, “it was not in his name,

00:51:40.174 --> 00:51:43.170
but I thought it’s better that I give it to him now.

00:51:43.330 --> 00:51:45.999
Later on I might become a bad man.”

00:51:46.159 --> 00:51:49.810
So the innocence works out in such a manner.

00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:52.522
And very sweet, sweet stories I have got to tell you.

00:51:52.682 --> 00:51:57.240
There’s one Sahaj Yogi who was a little boy, say about sixteen years of old,

00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:01.749
he came to me and he said, “My mother has some badhas and the father, too.

00:52:01.909 --> 00:52:03.327
I don’t know what to do.

00:52:03.487 --> 00:52:06.663
Now supposing I leave my father and mother,

00:52:06.823 --> 00:52:12.636
then will the badhas also leave me?” I said, “Maybe. May not be. Depends on…”

00:52:13.229 --> 00:52:16.100
“Then what is the need for people to leave their parents

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:20.264
when they are eighteen years of age? Why do people leave their parents

00:52:20.424 --> 00:52:24.569
at the eighteen years of age? Because, you see, it will be a big loss.”

00:52:24.729 --> 00:52:30.584
I said, “Why?” “Firstly, if I start smoking who will stop me?”

00:52:30.744 --> 00:52:34.280
Such an innocent thing. “If I start smoking,

00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:38.647
only my father can slap me on the face, nobody else.

00:52:38.807 --> 00:52:41.491
So he can save me from the smoking.”

00:52:41.651 --> 00:52:46.014
I was amazed at his innocence, the way he was saying that,

00:52:46.174 --> 00:52:48.889
“I want my father to be there to slap me.”

00:52:49.049 --> 00:52:52.444
And then he said, “And then my mother, she’s the one

00:52:52.604 --> 00:52:57.100
who corrects me every point; so if she goes away, if I am not with her,

00:52:57.260 --> 00:53:01.725
who will correct me? Who will tell me don’t do this and don’t do that?”

00:53:01.885 --> 00:53:06.342
I never understood that, look at this boy of sixteen years

00:53:06.502 --> 00:53:10.599
– he’s an Indian – telling me that his parents’ utility is

00:53:10.759 --> 00:53:15.987
that they are the only people who can stop him from doing wrong things!

00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:21.530
Because he was a born-realised and he could see that,

00:53:21.690 --> 00:53:26.319
“if I try to do something wrong it’s only my parents can tell me.”

00:53:26.479 --> 00:53:31.952
So this innocence always seeks [a] virtuous life,

00:53:32.112 --> 00:53:37.670
this better life and it doesn’t assert on others.

00:53:37.830 --> 00:53:41.491
But it’s, somehow or other, when there is innocence

00:53:41.651 --> 00:53:44.639
– just like you people are now Self-realised people –

00:53:44.799 --> 00:53:49.155
in the light of your Self, you don’t want to do something

00:53:49.315 --> 00:53:53.616
that is not innocent, that is not simple.

00:53:53.776 --> 00:53:56.600
For example, I have never seen such honest people

00:53:56.760 --> 00:54:00.420
as we have in Sahaja Yoga. Absolutely honest, I mean,

00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:04.202
they don’t want to take even a single pie (1/192 Rupee) out of things.

00:54:04.362 --> 00:54:07.233
Of course, there have been some horrible people, also,

00:54:07.393 --> 00:54:10.155
who made lots of money out of Sahaj Yog, doesn’t matter;

00:54:10.315 --> 00:54:13.905
but most of you have become so honest.

00:54:14.065 --> 00:54:16.764
I mean there’s so much corruption in this world

00:54:16.924 --> 00:54:20.776
and to see people who are so honest.

00:54:21.181 --> 00:54:24.722
Now the greatest quality, as you know, of Shri Ganesha’s

00:54:24.882 --> 00:54:29.600
I was told yesterday, that for them their Mother is the most important.

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:35.557
What Mother says and what Mother does, that’s the most important thing.

00:54:35.767 --> 00:54:41.381
I mean, it is so much that I really can’t understand

00:54:41.541 --> 00:54:45.947
how you people are so much fond of me.

00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:57.530
Because I think that, whatever you think about me mentally

00:54:57.690 --> 00:55:00.733
is nothing compared to what you have within yourself

00:55:00.893 --> 00:55:04.264
and that is Shri Ganesha’s, again, the quality.

00:55:04.424 --> 00:55:06.420
Because He’s so attached to me

00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:10.327
that he will fight his Father, he will fight everybody.

00:55:10.487 --> 00:55:12.249
That’s what you are.

00:55:12.409 --> 00:55:14.592
Anything against me, you cannot tolerate,

00:55:14.752 --> 00:55:18.608
anything wrong said against me you cannot follow.

00:55:18.768 --> 00:55:23.459
I have seen people getting furious if somebody said a word against me.

00:55:23.619 --> 00:55:30.225
So this quality of love for me is coming from Shri Ganesha within you.

00:55:30.385 --> 00:55:33.334
But the another quality, as I said, is that

00:55:33.494 --> 00:55:38.256
He makes the ganas work and so you have to work it out.

00:55:38.416 --> 00:55:43.983
Yesterday’s thing has shown me how this collectivity

00:55:44.143 --> 00:55:50.780
of Switzerland has come up so well, so well.

00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:58.334
And it was really showing how we can progress. You all have talents.

00:55:58.494 --> 00:56:01.809
Not that only Swiss have. You all have talents.

00:56:01.969 --> 00:56:05.499
You all have understanding. You are all intelligent.

00:56:05.659 --> 00:56:10.913
All of you are special people and you have to work out in collective way

00:56:11.073 --> 00:56:16.108
and also individual way to show your quality of Shri Ganesh,

00:56:16.268 --> 00:56:18.514
the way He has the rhythm within Him.

00:56:18.674 --> 00:56:22.405
He’s very rhythmic and yesterday those two big musicians sitting,

00:56:22.565 --> 00:56:28.303
he said, “Mother, they are so rhythmically clapping, they are rhythmic.

00:56:28.463 --> 00:56:32.350
There’s no, ‘ha, ha, hoo, hoo,’ just clapping and so rhythmic.

00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:34.631
Nobody makes a mistake.”

00:56:34.791 --> 00:56:38.194
Then they said, “When they sing also, nobody’s out of tune.”

00:56:38.354 --> 00:56:42.686
Normally, if ten people are singing, without proper training,

00:56:42.846 --> 00:56:46.846
then this are in alto, tenor, bass, everything, they go on.

00:56:47.007 --> 00:56:51.124
And you don’t know on what swar (note) they have taken, on what note they are singing.

00:56:51.284 --> 00:56:56.280
But they were yesterday very amazed that all of you were singing on the same note;

00:56:56.440 --> 00:57:00.319
you wouldn’t leave the note and come onto another note.

00:57:00.479 --> 00:57:04.905
That shows that the rhythm of Shri Ganesha is working in you

00:57:05.065 --> 00:57:12.608
and His understanding of music, which is one of His qualities is:

00:57:12.768 --> 00:57:24.096
that He dances on the music of which Nataraja, the Father Shiva has taught Him.

00:57:24.862 --> 00:57:29.334
It’s very rhythmic. That part, I think, a little bit, Sahaja Yogis are missing:

00:57:29.494 --> 00:57:34.194
that when they dance they need not be, all of them, in [a] very rhythmic pattern.

00:57:34.354 --> 00:57:37.905
They’re alright, but still one has to learn [a] little more

00:57:38.065 --> 00:57:40.490
rhythmic pattern, would be a good idea.

00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:43.959
As the Shri Ganesha, which is such a big stomach that He has,

00:57:44.119 --> 00:57:50.866
He dances so well, so lightly He lifts his body and the way He works it out, it’s amazing.

00:57:51.026 --> 00:57:56.772
How does He do it with such a…and a short person with such thick legs?

00:57:56.932 --> 00:58:04.413
He is very light and the lightness comes because of innocence – Mooladhar.

00:58:04.573 --> 00:58:09.319
If the Mooladhara is alright, then lightness is there.

00:58:09.479 --> 00:58:17.053
You have seen in Maharashtra how these people were playing the Lezim (dance)

00:58:17.213 --> 00:58:23.764
with such speed and with such lightness:

00:58:23.924 --> 00:58:26.350
they were lifting their legs and hand.

00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:31.885
It was really amazing how they were doing it.

00:58:32.994 --> 00:58:38.092
And it is only the innocence of these people of the villages

00:58:38.252 --> 00:58:42.170
that they don’t understand much of this nonsense.

00:58:42.330 --> 00:58:46.084
They don’t know what is going on with all these things.

00:58:46.244 --> 00:58:48.959
They earn their living, they are farmers,

00:58:49.119 --> 00:58:54.069
and then in the evening they just sleep off in complete innocence.

00:58:54.229 --> 00:58:58.022
They do not plan, they do not sit down and find out

00:58:58.182 --> 00:59:06.381
how to kill somebody, maybe something how to rob somebody

00:59:06.541 --> 00:59:09.663
or another bad things that people think

00:59:09.823 --> 00:59:13.267
– the bad action that comes into their minds. There is no time for that.

00:59:13.427 --> 00:59:16.513
They work the whole day. In the evening, nicely they sleep.

00:59:16.673 --> 00:59:22.256
Or else they will have a bhajan mandeley where they will all sing together

00:59:22.416 --> 00:59:24.397
in a very beautiful manner.

00:59:24.557 --> 00:59:30.444
So it’s a real sahaj style where we don’t have to think

00:59:30.604 --> 00:59:33.788
about killing anybody or to murder anybody.

00:59:33.948 --> 00:59:39.788
Like all these cults, they have weapons with them! I can’t understand.

00:59:39.948 --> 00:59:46.092
Even I was told that in Poland our Pope maharaj sent lots of weapons there.

00:59:46.252 --> 00:59:51.444
What is the need for anybody who is spiritual to have weapons around

00:59:51.604 --> 00:59:54.178
and think of violence and killing people?

00:59:54.338 --> 00:59:56.975
Because there is no innocence at all. You can see that.

00:59:57.135 --> 01:00:00.983
If you are innocent your power is your innocence,

01:00:01.143 --> 01:00:05.999
you don’t have to have weapons and guns and things.

01:00:06.159 --> 01:00:12.491
All these religions, so-called, are using nothing but weapons and guns

01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:16.725
and all kinds of killing objects and they are also killed.

01:00:16.885 --> 01:00:22.639
It’s a funny thing going on in the name of God, in the name of Shri Ganesh.

01:00:22.799 --> 01:00:24.920
There is no need for us to fight.

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:29.475
There is no need for us to think that we’ll kill this man or kill that one.

01:00:29.635 --> 01:00:33.256
Only you have to just desire, project your energy

01:00:33.416 --> 01:00:36.436
and you will see [that] the person will disappear.

01:00:36.596 --> 01:00:39.147
He’ll either become a transformed person

01:00:39.307 --> 01:00:43.323
or he will not be there to trouble you.

01:00:44.158 --> 01:00:49.280
So, one thing I have to again stress is that we must know our qualities

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.682
and our powers.

01:00:53.151 --> 01:00:57.483
Many people I know could never come on the stage and speak also.

01:00:57.643 --> 01:01:02.666
I said, “You get along – finished! Start it.” It worked out.

01:01:03.307 --> 01:01:07.561
Anything, you just project. “I can do it! Why can’t I do it?”

01:01:07.721 --> 01:01:11.221
To say, “I can’t. I am sorry.”

01:01:11.494 --> 01:01:13.009
This ‘sorry’ is so common now.

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:16.372
On the telephone also people will say “sorry”.  I said, “What ‘sorry’?”

01:01:16.533 --> 01:01:18.592
All the time, “sorry, sorry, sorry.”

01:01:18.752 --> 01:01:21.600
We used to say, “I beg your pardon,” – was sensible.

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:26.991
But the way people are, “Poor me, you know. How can I do it?”

01:01:27.151 --> 01:01:32.920
All such people are not yet aware of their powers that they have.

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:35.428
You can do it, everything. You can.

01:01:35.588 --> 01:01:39.819
Everything can be managed; after all, you have the power.

01:01:39.979 --> 01:01:44.663
In that power you must know that you are not going to do something indiscreet,

01:01:44.823 --> 01:01:47.014
you are not going to spoil anybody,

01:01:47.174 --> 01:01:52.045
but your power itself will show that this power

01:01:52.205 --> 01:02:00.600
is really of love, affection, compassion for the transformation of the whole world.

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:03.795
I am thinking of the complete global transformation,

01:02:03.955 --> 01:02:09.721
which, I know, is a mad dream, but still I think like that,

01:02:09.923 --> 01:02:15.311
because I see you all, then I think you all can do it

01:02:15.471 --> 01:02:22.971
and when I see the Shri Ganesha in you, I am sure it will work out.

01:02:23.752 --> 01:02:29.428
So, in my lifetime I have seen so many Sahaj Yogis, all over.

01:02:29.588 --> 01:02:33.459
How things are worked out: you have heard about in Brazil

01:02:33.619 --> 01:02:36.694
and also in Argentina, most unexpected.

01:02:36.854 --> 01:02:40.749
The people came to a program from twelve o’clock in the morning

01:02:40.909 --> 01:02:44.522
when we were going to have the program at seven o’clock!

01:02:44.682 --> 01:02:47.584
I reached there at about eight, as usual, and they said,

01:02:47.744 --> 01:02:50.290
“Mother, You won’t believe there was a big drama here!”

01:02:50.451 --> 01:02:53.623
I said, “What drama?” “They were sitting here from twelve o’clock,

01:02:53.784 --> 01:02:56.874
so all those who had come earlier got inside,

01:02:57.034 --> 01:03:00.600
but those who came at the last minute would not be allowed

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:02.803
and they are sitting there and fighting,

01:03:02.963 --> 01:03:06.639
‘No, we are going to come inside somehow!’ ”

01:03:06.799 --> 01:03:10.943
So then, one of the Sahaja Yogis sensibly went and talked to the manager

01:03:11.103 --> 01:03:14.116
and told, “Baba, let them come! There is room.”

01:03:14.276 --> 01:03:15.850
So there were four tiers.

01:03:16.010 --> 01:03:19.850
One was the ground, then one more, one more, one more.

01:03:20.010 --> 01:03:22.209
When I came I saw, “What’s this?”

01:03:22.369 --> 01:03:27.314
All over, the whole thing was filled with these people.

01:03:27.799 --> 01:03:31.819
I had never seen them before, but they were there,

01:03:31.979 --> 01:03:39.807
and so respectful, so much absorbing the vibrations.

01:03:40.673 --> 01:03:46.577
And I found it difficult to control my tears out of a real feeling

01:03:46.737 --> 01:03:52.010
of such gratitude for Shri Ganesh.

01:03:52.814 --> 01:03:55.288
He’s the one who worked it out.

01:03:55.448 --> 01:03:56.850
That’s why they say always,

01:03:57.010 --> 01:04:00.764
“First worship Shri Ganesh before starting any work,”

01:04:00.924 --> 01:04:03.725
because then it gives you that peace,

01:04:03.885 --> 01:04:09.436
that tremendous powerful peace which works out so many things

01:04:09.596 --> 01:04:12.729
that you never thought it would.

01:04:15.744 --> 01:04:20.342
So we have to request Shri Ganesha

01:04:20.502 --> 01:04:25.264
that all the problems of our land owning should be solved by Him

01:04:25.424 --> 01:04:28.428
and by your Shri Ganesh power.

01:04:28.588 --> 01:04:30.803
We are still hoping to get the land

01:04:30.963 --> 01:04:34.210
and I want to install this properly for you because every time

01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:36.944
I don’t want you to suffer like this.

01:04:37.104 --> 01:04:41.225
It’s a pilgrimage, but rather difficult this time you all had,

01:04:41.385 --> 01:04:45.326
but you managed it very nicely and you never showed

01:04:45.486 --> 01:04:51.471
any kind of a reluctance to accept this challenge.

01:04:52.338 --> 01:04:56.045
Shri Ganesha was testing you I think also, a little bit.

01:04:56.205 --> 01:04:59.405
But all that has worked out so well and now

01:04:59.565 --> 01:05:03.280
we are here to do the puja of Shri Ganesh.

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:05.519
May God Bless you.
