00:04:59.083 --> 00:05:03.417
Today is a unique combination

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.500
of Mother's Day in many countries,

00:05:07.875 --> 00:05:13.166
and Sahasrara Day for Sahaja yogis.

00:05:17.208 --> 00:05:21.208
I think this is the most important day

00:05:21.917 --> 00:05:26.999
in the history of human evolution,

00:05:28.667 --> 00:05:33.999
because all other events, incarnations

00:05:35.667 --> 00:05:41.000
and ventures in the spiritual atmosphere

00:05:42.458 --> 00:05:45.208
have been of no avail.

00:05:45.667 --> 00:05:48.792
On the contrary, they have gone

00:05:49.208 --> 00:05:53.500
into a kind of a cocoon

00:05:54.083 --> 00:05:56.709
which has no door,

00:05:57.166 --> 00:06:01.000
banging themselves against the walls,

00:06:02.041 --> 00:06:08.458
creating problems out of something very auspicious

00:06:08.875 --> 00:06:12.500
and extremely,

00:06:13.834 --> 00:06:17.041
beautifully spiritual.

00:06:18.333 --> 00:06:22.417
It's not possible to find faults

00:06:22.792 --> 00:06:26.125
with the incarnations in whose names

00:06:26.458 --> 00:06:29.291
all the religions came in.

00:06:30.792 --> 00:06:34.375
But this cocoon is the Mahamaya, I think.

00:06:34.792 --> 00:06:38.542
Cocoon is the one which is ignorance.

00:06:41.125 --> 00:06:43.291
We can say that

00:06:43.709 --> 00:06:47.333
Maya, Mahamaya does not create it.

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:49.625
This cocoon is created

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:53.500
by the basic ignorance of human beings

00:06:55.166 --> 00:06:58.625
and their misidentifications.

00:06:59.458 --> 00:07:03.125
So the human nature is such

00:07:03.792 --> 00:07:09.458
that it identifies itself easily with untruth.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.291
Anything that is truthful,

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:18.834
human beings find it very difficult to compromise.

00:07:19.375 --> 00:07:21.250
The trouble with the truth is

00:07:21.625 --> 00:07:23.999
that it cannot compromise.

00:07:24.834 --> 00:07:28.083
So all kinds of ignorance,

00:07:28.625 --> 00:07:30.959
all kinds of falsehood,

00:07:31.667 --> 00:07:34.333
all kinds of destructive forces

00:07:34.834 --> 00:07:36.750
gather together

00:07:37.166 --> 00:07:41.667
somehow or other, to attract human mind.

00:07:43.041 --> 00:07:46.458
It is perhaps the ego of man

00:07:46.792 --> 00:07:49.999
that makes him feel so attractive to those things,

00:07:50.333 --> 00:07:53.792
because they all pamper his ego.

00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:59.208
As it is, the most difficult center

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:05.917
that we have to cross is this center of Agnya.

00:08:07.125 --> 00:08:11.750
This center is the one which takes us out to either

00:08:12.083 --> 00:08:17.875
to the left or to the right, if you try to push it too much.

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:24.041
Thus we land up into the

00:08:25.834 --> 00:08:29.208
hold of ignorance,

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:34.166
which is being looked after by Mahamaya.

00:08:35.625 --> 00:08:38.000
They say that at Sahasrara

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:43.375
when the Goddess will appear, She will be a Mahamaya.

00:08:45.834 --> 00:08:52.208
Is it possible to be anything else as the world is today,

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:55.709
to come on this Earth?

00:08:56.208 --> 00:09:00.583
Any other type of incarnation

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:04.291
would have been in great trouble,

00:09:05.417 --> 00:09:07.917
because human beings in their ego

00:09:08.291 --> 00:09:12.500
are the highest in Kali Yuga, highest.

00:09:14.208 --> 00:09:16.458
So they are quite stupid

00:09:16.959 --> 00:09:20.291
and they are capable of doing any harm,

00:09:20.667 --> 00:09:23.917
any kind of harm, any kind of violence,

00:09:24.375 --> 00:09:27.750
to a divine personality.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:32.000
It is not at all possible

00:09:32.583 --> 00:09:35.834
to exist in this world

00:09:37.709 --> 00:09:40.917
as anything else but Mahamaya.

00:09:42.417 --> 00:09:46.875
But it also acts upon the people who are seeking.

00:09:47.999 --> 00:09:50.500
It has many facets.

00:09:50.999 --> 00:09:57.542
By one facet it covers your Sahasrara:

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:04.792
the seekers are tested.

00:10:07.458 --> 00:10:10.959
If you are more enamored by people

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:17.917
who are something odd, who wear odd dresses,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.834
who show odd things

00:10:21.834 --> 00:10:26.166
as so many false gurus have done,

00:10:27.041 --> 00:10:31.709
or absurd or something very cheapish,

00:10:32.417 --> 00:10:36.750
that attracts the attention of human beings

00:10:37.125 --> 00:10:39.208
because of Mahamaya,

00:10:39.625 --> 00:10:44.083
or we can say that it is the Mahamaya which judges a person.

00:10:45.792 --> 00:10:49.250
Mahamaya is like a mirror.

00:10:50.083 --> 00:10:54.875
Whatever you are, you see yourself in the mirror.

00:10:55.375 --> 00:10:57.625
Mirror has no responsibility.

00:10:57.999 --> 00:11:01.375
If you look like a monkey, you look like a monkey.

00:11:01.834 --> 00:11:04.750
If you look like a queen, you look like a queen.

00:11:05.166 --> 00:11:10.125
It has no power or no intention

00:11:10.875 --> 00:11:13.291
of giving you wrong ideas,

00:11:13.667 --> 00:11:17.750
or giving you something that is false.

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:21.667
It is there, whatever is the truth.

00:11:22.208 --> 00:11:24.792
So in a way to say that Mahamaya is the one

00:11:25.083 --> 00:11:28.000
which deludes us, is wrong.

00:11:28.917 --> 00:11:32.917
On the contrary, when you look at the mirror

00:11:33.917 --> 00:11:37.291
you see yourself as what you are.

00:11:38.542 --> 00:11:44.583
Now supposing you are a person who is, say,

00:11:45.625 --> 00:11:47.999
a very cruel person,

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:52.166
your face in the mirror will look like a cruel person.

00:11:52.959 --> 00:11:57.875
But the problem comes in when the Mahamaya acts,

00:11:59.542 --> 00:12:01.875
you don't see your image.

00:12:03.291 --> 00:12:06.375
You turn your face away from it,

00:12:06.999 --> 00:12:09.667
don't want to see, don't want to know.

00:12:10.125 --> 00:12:13.625
You look at the mirror, you see something horrible,

00:12:13.999 --> 00:12:19.125
you just turn face and you deny the truth,

00:12:20.208 --> 00:12:22.166
"How can I be like that? I'm not like that.

00:12:22.542 --> 00:12:24.583
I'm very good, nothing wrong with me.

00:12:24.959 --> 00:12:29.083
I've done nothing wrong. I'm perfectly all right."

00:12:32.083 --> 00:12:34.709
Then the third aspect of Mahamaya is

00:12:35.041 --> 00:12:37.959
that you are again attracted towards it,

00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:40.792
in a sense that you again see your mirror.

00:12:41.125 --> 00:12:43.583
You go on seeing that mirror again and again,

00:12:43.959 --> 00:12:47.250
and you see the whole world also in that mirror.

00:12:47.792 --> 00:12:53.083
As a result, you start getting a feeling,

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:56.291
"What am I doing?

00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:00.583
Who am I?

00:13:01.625 --> 00:13:04.458
What is this world?

00:13:04.959 --> 00:13:08.000
Where am I born?"

00:13:08.458 --> 00:13:12.667
And this is the beginning of your search.

00:13:13.166 --> 00:13:16.291
You don't feel satisfied with it,

00:13:16.959 --> 00:13:22.250
so it is a very great help of the Mahamaya.

00:13:23.834 --> 00:13:27.083
I have seen people who come to Me

00:13:33.999 --> 00:13:36.125
for the first time,

00:13:36.291 --> 00:13:39.750
and if they see Me taking water like this say,

00:13:40.041 --> 00:13:45.208
"Ah, how can She be something? She just needs water!"

00:13:46.375 --> 00:13:49.917
Or if I am taking, say,

00:13:50.333 --> 00:13:53.000
Coca Cola as you all take,

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.583
they'll say, "Wah, how can She take Coca Cola?

00:13:56.999 --> 00:13:58.667
She should never take anything like that,

00:13:58.959 --> 00:14:02.250
She should only take nectar."

00:14:09.542 --> 00:14:13.375
So the another aspect of Mahamaya is,

00:14:13.709 --> 00:14:16.083
say people come to see Me,

00:14:16.458 --> 00:14:19.166
some of them start shaking like this,

00:14:19.542 --> 00:14:21.542
so they think, "Oh, we are great energy,

00:14:21.834 --> 00:14:24.458
that's why it's happening to us."

00:14:24.917 --> 00:14:27.250
It has happened with many people.

00:14:27.709 --> 00:14:29.250
So they get wrong impressions

00:14:29.625 --> 00:14:33.625
because of their own reactions to it.

00:14:34.208 --> 00:14:36.875
Their reaction is, "Wow, we went there, got all the energy,

00:14:37.166 --> 00:14:41.583
we were shaking, shaking, shaking, so we are something great."

00:14:42.917 --> 00:14:47.542
This kind of a happening

00:14:48.208 --> 00:14:53.083
makes them more egoistical,

00:14:54.917 --> 00:14:58.834
but on the contrary if they see somebody else shaking

00:14:59.375 --> 00:15:03.500
- it has happened - and ask them "who you are?"

00:15:04.583 --> 00:15:08.583
So they'll say, "We are certified mad from such hospital."

00:15:09.166 --> 00:15:10.999
Then they will start relatively thinking,

00:15:11.333 --> 00:15:14.000
"Oh, God, we are also mad or what?

00:15:14.333 --> 00:15:16.792
Why are we shaking? We should not shake.

00:15:17.208 --> 00:15:20.875
If they are certified mad and they are shaking

00:15:21.166 --> 00:15:22.375
and we are shaking ..."

00:15:22.709 --> 00:15:26.583
then they start relatively seeing things.

00:15:27.709 --> 00:15:32.250
On one side there's a mad, certified mad shaking,

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:35.125
another side you are shaking,

00:15:35.667 --> 00:15:40.375
so there's something wrong definitely with you also.

00:15:41.166 --> 00:15:45.792
So the relative understanding helps

00:15:46.291 --> 00:15:50.667
to overcome that kind of a curtain that you have,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.375
that you do not want to face the truth.

00:15:57.583 --> 00:16:01.291
So, once it starts happening to you relatively

00:16:01.625 --> 00:16:04.583
you'll see compared to other people.

00:16:05.375 --> 00:16:07.709
Yesterday, as you saw in the drama,

00:16:08.083 --> 00:16:10.417
compared to other people we are a really sane,

00:16:10.875 --> 00:16:15.291
wise, sensible, matured people.

00:16:15.999 --> 00:16:20.000
Once you see that relative ascent,

00:16:20.542 --> 00:16:24.500
then you start settling in Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:27.834 --> 00:16:30.917
Mahamaya is very important.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.875
Without that you cannot face Me, you cannot sit here,

00:16:35.166 --> 00:16:36.125
you cannot talk to Me,

00:16:36.458 --> 00:16:38.999
you cannot get into the same car which is driving Me,

00:16:39.375 --> 00:16:41.959
and also you cannot drive Me.

00:16:43.166 --> 00:16:44.875
Everything would be impossible.

00:16:45.166 --> 00:16:46.834
I would be hanging in the air somewhere,

00:16:47.083 --> 00:16:51.166
you'll be all there and it would be a big mess.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.375
I wouldn't be, I don't need to travel by train,

00:16:56.792 --> 00:16:58.250
I don't need to travel by car,

00:16:58.667 --> 00:17:01.750
I can just fly out - what's this?

00:17:02.542 --> 00:17:07.417
I need not before you, I can be just here in nirakara,

00:17:07.792 --> 00:17:10.542
in formless form,

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:14.500
but how to communicate?

00:17:15.166 --> 00:17:17.959
How to have a rapport?

00:17:18.792 --> 00:17:24.583
For that, one has to come in the form of Mahamaya

00:17:25.125 --> 00:17:29.208
so that there's no fear, there's no distance,

00:17:29.709 --> 00:17:33.750
and one can come close and understand;

00:17:34.125 --> 00:17:37.041
because if this knowledge has to be given,

00:17:37.417 --> 00:17:40.250
if realization has to be given,

00:17:40.625 --> 00:17:44.375
people have to at least sit before the Mahamaya.

00:17:44.917 --> 00:17:48.999
Otherwise if they all run away, what's the use?

00:17:51.709 --> 00:17:55.208
So the create that human,

00:17:55.709 --> 00:18:00.667
extremely human personality in the Sahasrara,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.166
She comes as Mahamaya.

00:18:04.667 --> 00:18:08.166
Sahasrara is the most powerful chakra

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.792
because it is the seven chakras

00:18:12.083 --> 00:18:14.458
combination and many others.

00:18:14.959 --> 00:18:18.458
With the Sahasrara you can do anything.

00:18:18.959 --> 00:18:21.375
You can manage the sun, you can manage the moon,

00:18:21.709 --> 00:18:22.917
you can manage the earth,

00:18:23.166 --> 00:18:26.959
you can manage the temperatures, everything.

00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:33.959
But through Mahamaya things work out very normally,

00:18:34.375 --> 00:18:38.041
very normally, and they should work out normally.

00:18:38.583 --> 00:18:39.999
For example, somebody can say,

00:18:40.291 --> 00:18:42.417
"Mother, there is atmosphere full of

00:18:42.834 --> 00:18:47.083
all these horrible ecological problems.

00:18:47.625 --> 00:18:50.333
Why don't You clear them?"

00:18:53.999 --> 00:18:58.875
If it is cleared, people will go on producing.

00:19:00.542 --> 00:19:03.625
It is the problem of the human beings,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.875
and if it is corrected by Me

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:12.750
they'll take it for granted.

00:19:13.208 --> 00:19:15.208
They have to face those problems,

00:19:15.625 --> 00:19:17.375
they have to change their habits,

00:19:17.792 --> 00:19:20.500
they have to understand that they are the one

00:19:20.834 --> 00:19:23.250
who are destruct, destroying themselves.

00:19:23.709 --> 00:19:26.959
Otherwise if somebody's there just to cleanse it out,

00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:30.083
they will never change.

00:19:34.875 --> 00:19:39.166
Also, miraculously, one can do lots of things.

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:41.917
One can say, "Mother, as You solve the problems

00:19:42.166 --> 00:19:45.250
of Sahaja yogis, why don't You solve the problem of others?"

00:19:45.542 --> 00:19:48.250
No.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.250
To solve their problem is not the end of My work,

00:19:55.166 --> 00:19:57.999
nor is the purpose.

00:19:58.417 --> 00:20:01.333
But to make them equipped

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:04.917
so that they can solve their own problem,

00:20:05.291 --> 00:20:07.625
that's what I have to do.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.166
As I've said that

00:20:12.083 --> 00:20:14.166
you have to be your own doctor,

00:20:14.542 --> 00:20:18.000
you have to be your own guru.

00:20:18.625 --> 00:20:21.375
Without Mahamaya you cannot do it

00:20:21.834 --> 00:20:28.125
because She knows how far to go in correcting,

00:20:29.709 --> 00:20:32.667
how far to go in controlling;

00:20:33.083 --> 00:20:37.291
because human beings at large have their own freedom.

00:20:37.834 --> 00:20:42.583
Sahaja yogis have not that kind of a stupid freedom,

00:20:42.959 --> 00:20:46.125
but they have the freedom of the spirit.

00:20:46.625 --> 00:20:51.208
So to solve their problems is perfectly all right,

00:20:51.792 --> 00:20:54.875
because they must have more freedom and more freedom.

00:20:55.333 --> 00:20:57.458
But what's the use of giving freedom

00:20:57.917 --> 00:21:01.291
to other people who are going on and on and on,

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:03.583
without realizing what wrong

00:21:03.875 --> 00:21:05.583
they are doing to the whole world?

00:21:05.999 --> 00:21:09.291
So for them it is necessary to come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:21:09.709 --> 00:21:12.417
and that's why it's a Mahamaya swarupa.

00:21:13.166 --> 00:21:16.542
Maybe if I had come as Mother Mary

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.500
or Radha or somebody like that,

00:21:19.959 --> 00:21:22.625
they would have been all here very nicely singing songs

00:21:22.959 --> 00:21:25.917
and all that. That's not the point.

00:21:26.291 --> 00:21:29.999
Now you have to mature, you have to be something,

00:21:30.458 --> 00:21:32.750
you have to grow.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:36.625
For that it is important

00:21:37.333 --> 00:21:41.667
that you have to come to Sahaja Yoga first of all.

00:21:42.166 --> 00:21:44.250
Then you have to grow in Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:44.709 --> 00:21:47.125
Otherwise this Mahamaya will go on acting

00:21:47.542 --> 00:21:49.875
and playing tricks with you.

00:21:51.583 --> 00:21:54.834
Again taking water.

00:22:06.834 --> 00:22:09.458
So they also once said so,

00:22:09.917 --> 00:22:12.917
that "Why does She need water sometimes?

00:22:13.291 --> 00:22:16.959
She should be living on the air or some ..."

00:22:20.166 --> 00:22:22.667
It's a big play.

00:22:23.125 --> 00:22:27.542
Sahasrara, as you know, is Virata's area,

00:22:27.999 --> 00:22:29.750
Virat and Viratangana.

00:22:30.125 --> 00:22:35.375
Virata is Vishnu, who became Rama,

00:22:35.959 --> 00:22:38.917
then became Krishna and then Virat.

00:22:40.458 --> 00:22:43.750
So She's as a Leela,

00:22:44.291 --> 00:22:47.583
He's Leeladhara - it's a play;

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.792
and to make the play all right

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:54.999
one has to be in the form of Mahamaya.

00:22:56.583 --> 00:23:00.959
But there are so many

00:23:05.667 --> 00:23:08.875
loopholes also sometimes.

00:23:09.792 --> 00:23:14.458
People can discover things very easily.

00:23:14.959 --> 00:23:18.959
One of them is this Paramchaitanya.

00:23:19.834 --> 00:23:22.709
This Paramchaitanya acts,

00:23:23.333 --> 00:23:26.291
shows My photographs, exposes Me

00:23:26.667 --> 00:23:30.709
in all kinds of unbelievable manners

00:23:30.999 --> 00:23:33.250
which has never happened before.

00:23:33.667 --> 00:23:37.125
I am Myself amazed the way it thinks

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.500
of exposing Me all the time.

00:23:46.959 --> 00:23:50.291
This time when we were in Brisbane

00:23:50.667 --> 00:23:56.000
they took a photograph of a rainbow outside,

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:59.999
outside the ashram, and what appears there in the sky

00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:03.083
is very remarkable; it's going to come that photograph, too.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.625
Is a painting which I have always liked of Mother and Child,

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.583
Madonna and the Child - in the sky, that painting.

00:24:12.041 --> 00:24:14.834
Now can you beat that?

00:24:15.375 --> 00:24:19.041
How does it know that I love that painting, and all that?

00:24:19.542 --> 00:24:22.000
And it was in the sky!

00:24:22.583 --> 00:24:26.583
So this Paramachaitanya is trying to expose

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.834
this Mahamaya swarupa,

00:24:29.208 --> 00:24:31.959
just to make you understand

00:24:32.208 --> 00:24:38.500
what is Mahamaya.

00:24:39.125 --> 00:24:43.709
It is trying to express itself.

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:48.667
I have not in any way

00:24:49.291 --> 00:24:55.041
told or asked this Paramchaitanya to do any such things,

00:24:56.041 --> 00:24:58.000
but it is doing.

00:24:58.458 --> 00:25:01.625
Because it thinks that even now the people

00:25:02.083 --> 00:25:03.458
who are following Mother

00:25:03.834 --> 00:25:07.375
are not of that level as they should be.

00:25:07.959 --> 00:25:11.041
Some of them do falter horribly, surprisingly

00:25:11.375 --> 00:25:13.667
- how far they can go I cannot believe.

00:25:14.083 --> 00:25:16.999
After coming to Sahaja Yoga, after seeing all My photographs,

00:25:17.291 --> 00:25:19.417
after everything else,

00:25:19.792 --> 00:25:25.625
they still can go to any limit of stupidity. That's a fact.

00:25:26.166 --> 00:25:29.083
So this is going on.

00:25:29.458 --> 00:25:32.375
I don't know how far this Paramchaitanya

00:25:32.875 --> 00:25:36.291
is spontaneously acting like this,

00:25:36.834 --> 00:25:38.583
but it shows one thing for definite,

00:25:38.999 --> 00:25:45.709
that it wants you to be perfectly settled down in your faith,

00:25:46.792 --> 00:25:49.875
which is not a blind faith.

00:25:50.458 --> 00:25:54.500
But most of these painting,

00:25:54.875 --> 00:25:57.083
photographs can be challenged.

00:25:57.583 --> 00:25:58.959
Anybody who's an intellectual

00:25:59.291 --> 00:26:00.834
can find out some ways and methods

00:26:01.125 --> 00:26:03.166
that can challenge you that "you must have done this."

00:26:03.542 --> 00:26:04.917
But as Sahaja yogis you know that

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:08.583
we have done nothing of the kind, and it has come out.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.542
So what is the purpose?

00:26:12.041 --> 00:26:14.999
We don't show them to outsiders,

00:26:15.542 --> 00:26:20.291
we only show this to the Sahaja yogis.

00:26:20.875 --> 00:26:23.291
So what is the purpose?

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:26.542
That Sahaja yogis should now

00:26:26.999 --> 00:26:33.417
try to understand that they have to grow.

00:26:35.834 --> 00:26:40.583
Now this growth has to be two-sided.

00:26:52.041 --> 00:26:56.333
One is

00:26:57.542 --> 00:27:01.166
yourself,

00:27:02.417 --> 00:27:09.500
"How much time do I spend thinking about Sahaja Yoga,

00:27:11.625 --> 00:27:14.917
and how much about my personal life,

00:27:15.291 --> 00:27:20.041
my education, my business, my duties,

00:27:20.417 --> 00:27:23.917
my jobs, my family?"

00:27:27.583 --> 00:27:30.041
Because it is important,

00:27:30.625 --> 00:27:35.458
as the brain has to think and Virata is there.

00:27:36.125 --> 00:27:39.458
So in Sahasrara,

00:27:40.333 --> 00:27:43.834
how much energy do we use

00:27:45.583 --> 00:27:49.041
to think about Sahaja Yoga?

00:27:49.792 --> 00:27:54.417
How can we spread Sahaja Yoga?

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:57.500
What should we do?

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.166
What should we work it out?

00:28:00.667 --> 00:28:04.709
How much I should support, in which way?

00:28:06.417 --> 00:28:12.417
How it can be my every moment living?

00:28:13.458 --> 00:28:16.125
How I look at everything,

00:28:16.709 --> 00:28:19.792
I see Sahaj working in it?

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:22.792
What is the Sahaj culture?

00:28:23.291 --> 00:28:25.792
Am I in the Sahaj culture?

00:28:26.291 --> 00:28:29.500
How much I'm impressed by other cultures

00:28:29.875 --> 00:28:31.667
and fashions and things?

00:28:32.083 --> 00:28:37.500
And what have I to gain,

00:28:37.959 --> 00:28:43.999
to grow in my mental capacity to be a Sahaj?

00:28:45.542 --> 00:28:51.000
For example, a person who is a Sahaj personality,

00:28:51.458 --> 00:28:53.959
in everything he sees Sahaj, in everything,

00:28:54.291 --> 00:28:58.542
whether it is flowers, it's carpets, lights,

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.208
statues, pendal, anything,

00:29:04.542 --> 00:29:07.834
it sees the Sahaj.

00:29:09.999 --> 00:29:14.583
How? See now, these pillars are standing at an angle;

00:29:15.041 --> 00:29:19.041
just imagine, to support it

00:29:19.458 --> 00:29:23.083
how you had to bend on one side.

00:29:23.583 --> 00:29:26.000
What do we do in Sahaj?

00:29:26.417 --> 00:29:30.834
We have to bend towards Divinity.

00:29:31.291 --> 00:29:37.625
See like that, all ideas go moving towards Sahaj.

00:29:38.291 --> 00:29:41.000
The whole thinking is Sahaj.

00:29:41.417 --> 00:29:42.875
Such a married life also

00:29:43.166 --> 00:29:44.625
between husband and wife I have seen.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.917
If both are Sahaj, they all the time talk of Sahaj

00:29:49.291 --> 00:29:53.458
- no frivolous talk, not useless talk, but only about Sahaj,

00:29:53.959 --> 00:29:58.542
how it is Sahaj to be husband and wife,

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.166
what is the relationship,

00:30:01.542 --> 00:30:03.500
that's the most interesting in Sahaj.

00:30:03.875 --> 00:30:07.500
Like that, you see the everything that you do,

00:30:07.999 --> 00:30:10.999
you think on Sahaj way.

00:30:11.709 --> 00:30:15.834
So now then you can judge yourself in this Mahamaya.

00:30:16.458 --> 00:30:20.667
How far do you care really to think about Sahaj?

00:30:21.125 --> 00:30:23.166
But all other worries would be like this,

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.667
"How much I will get money out of it?

00:30:27.041 --> 00:30:28.959
How much business I'll get?

00:30:29.417 --> 00:30:31.667
How much pleasure I can get?

00:30:34.208 --> 00:30:38.166
How much physical problems can be solved?"

00:30:38.792 --> 00:30:42.667
All these gains are nothing

00:30:43.125 --> 00:30:47.583
compared to your maturity in Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:48.083 --> 00:30:49.500
But the mind takes over.

00:30:49.917 --> 00:30:52.542
It starts thinking and thinking,

00:30:53.083 --> 00:30:56.458
and it goes on wandering on various things:

00:30:56.999 --> 00:31:02.291
maybe your wife, your children, your house, this, that.

00:31:04.041 --> 00:31:07.250
But if you think in a Sahaj way you'll think,

00:31:07.709 --> 00:31:11.417
"I should do something that my children should be Sahaj.

00:31:11.959 --> 00:31:17.250
I should make a house which is useful to the Sahaj.

00:31:18.291 --> 00:31:22.542
I should behave in such a manner that I am Sahaj."

00:31:24.208 --> 00:31:27.083
The maturity in you should grow

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:31.458
in such a way that you can feel it.

00:31:31.999 --> 00:31:35.667
Firstly is the peace.

00:31:36.208 --> 00:31:38.667
When person is not peaceful

00:31:39.083 --> 00:31:44.375
his mind is like

00:31:44.959 --> 00:31:49.709
a wobbly instrument.

00:31:50.166 --> 00:31:53.125
He cannot think properly, he cannot see properly,

00:31:53.583 --> 00:31:55.500
he cannot understand properly.

00:31:55.875 --> 00:31:59.875
You tell him something, he understands something else.

00:32:00.458 --> 00:32:05.500
Now the whole world today is wobbly,

00:32:05.875 --> 00:32:07.208
whole world.

00:32:07.625 --> 00:32:11.041
Here this new party

00:32:11.458 --> 00:32:15.083
has dismantled the other whole party in politics;

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.999
it is this one is to be dismantled now.

00:32:18.375 --> 00:32:19.959
Everything is going upside-down.

00:32:20.333 --> 00:32:24.208
That too is through Mahamaya.

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:32.834
One has to admit

00:32:33.291 --> 00:32:38.792
that the way the, the way the world is in turmoil.

00:32:39.667 --> 00:32:42.291
It's not war, it's not cold war,

00:32:42.709 --> 00:32:46.208
but it's a kind of a funny type

00:32:46.667 --> 00:32:49.375
of a warfare

00:32:49.834 --> 00:32:52.667
which cannot be described in words, you see.

00:32:53.125 --> 00:32:56.917
Now, what will you say to what is happening in Italy today?

00:32:57.375 --> 00:33:00.291
What will you see to what is happening in Bosnia

00:33:00.709 --> 00:33:06.667
or any other place where you find stupid problems coming up

00:33:07.041 --> 00:33:09.834
and people killing each other, no peace,

00:33:10.166 --> 00:33:11.625
no sense of security.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.375
You find in the world, you use, you open the newspaper

00:33:15.917 --> 00:33:18.792
- we had an English newspaper today, I couldn't read:

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:22.166
so many women were raped, so many men were killed,

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:25.208
this thing happened; individually also.

00:33:25.667 --> 00:33:28.375
President doing nonsensical things like that.

00:33:28.792 --> 00:33:33.667
I mean, all sorts of things you see today is absurd.

00:33:34.291 --> 00:33:38.542
When we were of your age, we never heard of such things.

00:33:39.417 --> 00:33:42.709
People were dignified, sensible people.

00:33:43.166 --> 00:33:47.875
So now what has happened is they are just shattered.

00:33:48.333 --> 00:33:52.333
There's no peace in their mind to see what they're doing,

00:33:52.709 --> 00:33:55.834
where are they, what is their responsibility.

00:33:58.834 --> 00:34:01.999
Horrible things are being expressed.

00:34:02.625 --> 00:34:05.291
Media is taking to all horrible things.

00:34:05.709 --> 00:34:07.458
It was never so before.

00:34:07.875 --> 00:34:11.709
We have read beautiful articles of beautiful things

00:34:12.041 --> 00:34:15.917
in the media itself, but today it is very different.

00:34:16.917 --> 00:34:19.250
Then it is a very materialistic world,

00:34:19.667 --> 00:34:21.667
extremely materialistic:

00:34:22.125 --> 00:34:24.500
marketing this, marketing that, marketing that,

00:34:24.875 --> 00:34:26.709
marketing human beings.

00:34:27.083 --> 00:34:28.792
Then they are taking away children,

00:34:29.166 --> 00:34:32.500
taking away women, they're selling the children,

00:34:32.917 --> 00:34:38.583
they're selling the women - all kinds of things going on.

00:34:39.166 --> 00:34:42.458
Marketing God, marketing spirituality, marketing

00:34:42.917 --> 00:34:46.417
- I don't know what to say, but their own children.

00:34:46.917 --> 00:34:51.458
This kind of a perverse world is today.

00:34:52.208 --> 00:34:55.500
For that is needed Mahamaya,

00:34:56.041 --> 00:34:59.999
by which She shows that you have to pay

00:35:00.417 --> 00:35:05.291
through your noses for what you are doing, in this lifetime.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.750
Say, a man who is very wayward, destructive, who drinks,

00:35:10.083 --> 00:35:14.250
smokes, goes away with women and all that:

00:35:14.625 --> 00:35:17.625
within two years he's bankrupt.

00:35:19.417 --> 00:35:21.500
So the reward is already there.

00:35:21.917 --> 00:35:24.542
Whatever he was doing is there to see.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.417
Another man - "What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong?"

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:28.959
- goes on with nonsensical things.

00:35:29.291 --> 00:35:31.875
He get AIDS or he gets other diseases

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:36.250
of a very incurable nature.

00:35:38.291 --> 00:35:43.500
We call it rokrah Devi: means "cash payment", cash payment;

00:35:44.458 --> 00:35:46.875
the Goddess who gives cash payment.

00:35:47.375 --> 00:35:49.625
"You do this - all right, have it.

00:35:50.083 --> 00:35:52.166
You have done this - all right, enjoy this."

00:35:52.667 --> 00:35:56.291
Like that. It is really this Mahamaya specially

00:35:56.709 --> 00:35:59.875
who is now very much sort of active.

00:36:00.333 --> 00:36:02.166
Sometimes I get a fright from Her,

00:36:02.583 --> 00:36:06.291
for the way She is punishing people is a bit too much.

00:36:07.083 --> 00:36:09.417
But it is so. If you do rash driving,

00:36:09.834 --> 00:36:13.083
"Oh, I'll enjoy rash driving" - all right, finished.

00:36:13.709 --> 00:36:18.333
You end up with a limping leg or a broken hand.

00:36:19.417 --> 00:36:25.542
So the laws, the divine law's at work through Mahamaya.

00:36:26.041 --> 00:36:29.250
It was not that fast before as it is today.

00:36:29.709 --> 00:36:33.875
Supposing there's a president of America

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:38.208
- such a big position, I mean, imagine

00:36:38.834 --> 00:36:44.583
- he's being challenged by any third-rater from the street.

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:48.083
How is it possible?

00:36:48.625 --> 00:36:51.333
Nobody could do that before.

00:36:51.834 --> 00:36:59.333
Because Mahamaya is using all its free will

00:37:01.208 --> 00:37:04.667
to check the free will of human beings.

00:37:05.083 --> 00:37:07.834
The so-called freedom

00:37:08.333 --> 00:37:13.792
that we are trying to enjoy

00:37:15.041 --> 00:37:18.500
is brought to an end.

00:37:19.083 --> 00:37:21.750
People start thinking, what is it?

00:37:22.166 --> 00:37:23.500
- big people, you know.

00:37:23.875 --> 00:37:26.917
There was some boxer, very well-known,

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:29.917
people used to run after him, now he's in jail.

00:37:30.375 --> 00:37:34.667
Another fellow who was doing this Grand Prix,

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.917
which against I was always, died suddenly.

00:37:39.291 --> 00:37:41.417
Now people - he's a hero, this, that,

00:37:41.792 --> 00:37:43.834
but nobody will now do that, all right.

00:37:44.333 --> 00:37:47.250
One hero is sufficient. Not me, sir,

00:37:47.709 --> 00:37:51.333
I'm not going to take to this Grand Prix business

00:37:51.625 --> 00:37:52.999
- had enough of it.

00:37:53.333 --> 00:37:55.291
So, though one hero is created,

00:37:55.750 --> 00:38:00.458
but the fear of doing this kind of a nonsense.

00:38:00.999 --> 00:38:05.125
Then they go for - what is called that? - skiing.

00:38:05.667 --> 00:38:09.000
Now in the skiing also somebody died

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:12.250
and somebody got a lame leg;

00:38:12.667 --> 00:38:14.458
I think in the royal family something happened,

00:38:14.917 --> 00:38:19.000
so now from England very few people are going for skiing.

00:38:19.667 --> 00:38:24.166
Now only the Swiss have to learn a lesson, I think.

00:38:24.709 --> 00:38:28.709
It's something - you just keep your eyes open.

00:38:29.208 --> 00:38:32.542
Today you read somebody boasting very much about himself,

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.875
tomorrow you find him in the jail, you know.

00:38:36.417 --> 00:38:39.750
It was very surprising, there was a some minister in Italy

00:38:40.125 --> 00:38:41.709
who wanted Me to meet, and I said,

00:38:41.999 --> 00:38:43.166
"Oh baba, I don't want to meet him."

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:47.000
He's a very bad past. He's in jail already,

00:38:47.458 --> 00:38:50.750
so I can't meet him now.

00:38:57.875 --> 00:39:00.750
They are falling into their own traps.

00:39:01.208 --> 00:39:03.542
This trap is Mahamaya.

00:39:03.999 --> 00:39:08.959
She creates from your own - it's through your own,

00:39:09.417 --> 00:39:11.792
because you don't want to face yourself,

00:39:12.166 --> 00:39:14.000
you don't want to know the truth,

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.792
you want to evade the truth.

00:39:18.667 --> 00:39:20.875
So this is the aspect of Mahamaya,

00:39:21.291 --> 00:39:25.125
that immediately you have to face yourself.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.250
How many things have happened? Think of it.

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:32.750
These big, big tycoons are in jail.

00:39:33.291 --> 00:39:38.417
Very famous people from, say, drug

00:39:39.208 --> 00:39:45.834
- great, rich people, they are in jail.

00:39:46.667 --> 00:39:49.542
All such things are happening.

00:39:49.875 --> 00:39:51.083
Why?

00:39:51.375 --> 00:39:56.417
Because this Mahamaya is the one who wants to teach a lesson.

00:39:56.834 --> 00:39:58.709
By teaching a lesson to one person

00:39:59.041 --> 00:40:01.333
it shatters at least thousands,

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:05.000
because that person sees the point,

00:40:05.542 --> 00:40:08.583
as death comes to it or whatever it comes to it.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.333
Maybe he may not learn the lesson,

00:40:11.709 --> 00:40:14.041
was he already dead to learn anything any more;

00:40:14.375 --> 00:40:16.875
but others are.

00:40:17.333 --> 00:40:19.417
It, how it spreads.

00:40:19.792 --> 00:40:21.709
So in a way the media also,

00:40:22.166 --> 00:40:23.959
that always gives bad news,

00:40:24.291 --> 00:40:26.667
in a way does not know

00:40:26.999 --> 00:40:30.959
how much good it is doing through Mahamaya.

00:40:33.375 --> 00:40:37.583
Now for your information, many things we are saying about

00:40:37.917 --> 00:40:40.458
- like say, smoking is already going out.

00:40:40.959 --> 00:40:42.875
Drinking will also go out.

00:40:43.375 --> 00:40:47.583
What did the Sahaj do? Nothing - but a Mahamaya.

00:40:49.125 --> 00:40:50.542
They get cancers.

00:40:50.959 --> 00:40:53.959
Doctors have got the idea now, they have got cancer,

00:40:54.291 --> 00:40:57.959
and they have asked people that now don't smoke,

00:40:58.291 --> 00:40:59.917
otherwise you'll get cancer.

00:41:00.375 --> 00:41:03.999
So the Mahamaya creates

00:41:04.542 --> 00:41:10.542
that kind of an, I should say, an incident.

00:41:11.667 --> 00:41:13.917
Single incident is sufficient

00:41:14.291 --> 00:41:19.458
for people to be extremely cautious.

00:41:20.792 --> 00:41:24.917
Moreover, it is such a panicked world,

00:41:25.458 --> 00:41:27.583
so insecure today.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.500
Suddenly you find the cows are giving poison in their milk,

00:41:33.999 --> 00:41:35.875
there's something else happening,

00:41:36.333 --> 00:41:38.583
the water is getting polluted.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.375
Then suddenly you find there are needles,

00:41:41.917 --> 00:41:44.375
which are infected.

00:41:44.834 --> 00:41:47.917
So everybody is so nervous

00:41:48.458 --> 00:41:51.500
and thinking about

00:41:52.667 --> 00:41:55.458
saving their lives, so

00:41:55.999 --> 00:41:59.041
they start thinking about it.

00:41:59.999 --> 00:42:02.583
But in Sahaj

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.166
if you come, none of these things can trouble you,

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:12.750
because this is the aspect of Mahamaya that She protects you.

00:42:13.709 --> 00:42:15.125
She protects you.

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.458
Nobody can destroy a Sahaja yogi,

00:42:17.792 --> 00:42:19.875
unless and until they want to be destroyed.

00:42:20.333 --> 00:42:24.917
It's their desire. Nobody can touch them.

00:42:25.458 --> 00:42:28.166
Now when they talk about miracles - like the other day

00:42:28.625 --> 00:42:32.250
one boy from Australia, a new Sahaja yogi,

00:42:32.834 --> 00:42:34.375
was going on a motorbike

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:36.959
and suddenly he was in a great speed,

00:42:37.291 --> 00:42:42.000
and from both the sides two trucks came and they hit him.

00:42:43.083 --> 00:42:46.333
But instead of getting hit, he was just sort of

00:42:46.834 --> 00:42:50.834
pushed out like a shuttlecock and he fell on the other side;

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:52.917
and he was not at all hurt and he got up,

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:54.834
and they were surprised.

00:42:55.208 --> 00:42:59.250
His bike was shattered, everything,

00:42:59.625 --> 00:43:01.125
and this fellow's perfectly all right.

00:43:01.583 --> 00:43:04.709
They couldn't understand how this boy has saved himself.

00:43:05.083 --> 00:43:07.750
There are so many, so many stories like that,

00:43:08.166 --> 00:43:13.500
that shows that how this Mahamaya is protecting Sahaja yogis:

00:43:14.125 --> 00:43:17.667
protection, very caring.

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:21.999
Also in dreams She protects.

00:43:22.417 --> 00:43:25.834
It's very surprising how people get dreams

00:43:26.375 --> 00:43:28.750
and how they get their medicines,

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:31.291
how they get their treatment,

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:35.125
how they understand about the dangers that are there,

00:43:35.625 --> 00:43:39.583
how in dreams they are told about how other people are,

00:43:39.917 --> 00:43:41.417
how they behave.

00:43:41.917 --> 00:43:44.834
You don't have to know it in conscious mind,

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:51.333
but into the very, very deep sushupti state in dreams,

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:56.250
you know what is good for you, what is bad for you.

00:43:56.834 --> 00:43:59.625
Somehow they know.

00:44:01.375 --> 00:44:07.291
And it is that knowledge which - intuitive, we can call it

00:44:07.792 --> 00:44:10.375
- comes through Mahamaya.

00:44:10.834 --> 00:44:15.375
She's the one who gives you this intuitive knowledge

00:44:15.792 --> 00:44:19.041
what to be done, what is to be done,

00:44:19.542 --> 00:44:22.917
how to get out of problems. And you do;

00:44:23.333 --> 00:44:26.417
whether you manage it or not, you get out of it.

00:44:26.875 --> 00:44:31.458
There's so many examples of this, thousand and one.

00:44:34.125 --> 00:44:36.583
One of them I'll tell you;

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:39.083
it comes to My mind now.

00:44:39.417 --> 00:44:41.875
In Australia there was a very, very nice Sahaja yogi,

00:44:42.125 --> 00:44:43.959
very great Sahaja yogi, very learned one

00:44:44.333 --> 00:44:45.583
but a simple man.

00:44:45.959 --> 00:44:47.917
And another horrible one

00:44:48.291 --> 00:44:50.792
told him that he should buy this particular land

00:44:51.125 --> 00:44:54.375
and particular thing called Lilydale,

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:56.834
and "We can start Sahaja Yoga there.

00:44:57.125 --> 00:44:59.166
We can do this, we can do that."

00:44:59.542 --> 00:45:01.333
So whatever earnings he had,

00:45:01.792 --> 00:45:05.999
he put it there as a - to begin with.

00:45:07.041 --> 00:45:09.333
And the bank said, "We'll give you money."

00:45:09.875 --> 00:45:13.333
But in that report he had written that

00:45:14.999 --> 00:45:19.000
"We have Sahaja Yoga properties, my properties, anything.

00:45:19.458 --> 00:45:23.750
That this is there available in case we fail to pay."

00:45:24.417 --> 00:45:28.959
When I saw this I thought, "Now it's too much."

00:45:29.625 --> 00:45:31.458
So I asked the lawyer and he said that

00:45:31.834 --> 00:45:33.583
it is better you give it in the newspaper,

00:45:33.959 --> 00:45:36.000
otherwise nobody can take your land

00:45:36.333 --> 00:45:37.542
or anything or your property,

00:45:37.959 --> 00:45:39.208
but one thing is for sure

00:45:39.709 --> 00:45:43.500
that you will have to go to court for years together.

00:45:44.125 --> 00:45:46.083
So best is to give in the newspaper,

00:45:46.458 --> 00:45:48.625
that you have nothing to do with this Lilydale,

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.333
nor Sahaja Yoga has anything to do with it.

00:45:51.792 --> 00:45:53.333
Now this gentleman got very upset

00:45:53.625 --> 00:45:55.709
because the bank would not give the money,

00:45:56.083 --> 00:45:58.166
and then the people who were selling it

00:45:58.625 --> 00:46:01.333
put a suit against him.

00:46:01.999 --> 00:46:04.083
He was already a bankrupt, he didn't know what to do

00:46:04.417 --> 00:46:06.125
and was very much in trouble.

00:46:06.667 --> 00:46:09.083
I said, "Don't worry,

00:46:09.959 --> 00:46:12.500
you are under protection."

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.750
And you'll be amazed that

00:46:15.125 --> 00:46:18.667
despite all kinds of fears people had

00:46:19.041 --> 00:46:20.542
that he might be arrested

00:46:20.917 --> 00:46:23.917
or God knows whatever house he has will be sold out,

00:46:24.208 --> 00:46:27.500
everything; on the contrary that Lilydale,

00:46:27.917 --> 00:46:31.166
somebody offered money to purchase it at a much higher price.

00:46:31.542 --> 00:46:34.500
So he got a higher price,

00:46:36.417 --> 00:46:39.125
and so he sold it.

00:46:39.667 --> 00:46:41.291
But you have to have patience,

00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:44.458
and you have to have faith and courage.

00:46:45.041 --> 00:46:48.959
He said, "Mother, I know nobody can destroy me."

00:46:50.583 --> 00:46:53.667
And this is how the protection of the Mahamaya,

00:46:54.166 --> 00:46:55.667
the first part of Mahamaya

00:46:56.083 --> 00:47:00.625
was to make this man expose

00:47:01.083 --> 00:47:03.999
this bad Sahaja yogi to all the people.

00:47:04.458 --> 00:47:06.458
There was a big following for him,

00:47:06.834 --> 00:47:09.917
and a good speaker, this and that;

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:13.583
then all they dropped out.

00:47:14.667 --> 00:47:17.750
So it works also on the collective side.

00:47:18.542 --> 00:47:22.166
There's someone who tries to trouble the Sahaja yogis:

00:47:22.583 --> 00:47:24.000
all right,

00:47:24.417 --> 00:47:27.709
the Mahamaya allows him to trouble for a point,

00:47:28.041 --> 00:47:32.166
up to a point, and then suddenly She acts,

00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:34.834
so the people are amazed,

00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:39.125
Sahaja yogis are amazed how this man has become like this.

00:47:41.041 --> 00:47:46.834
This Mahamaya is always like My sari, as you say

00:47:48.083 --> 00:47:50.625
- is protecting you.

00:47:51.125 --> 00:47:55.250
She's beautiful, She's very kind, caring, compassionate,

00:47:55.750 --> 00:48:00.041
affectionate; delicately She handles you.

00:48:00.792 --> 00:48:04.709
And She's very, very

00:48:10.542 --> 00:48:16.250
angry and kills the people

00:48:16.625 --> 00:48:21.041
who try to spoil the work of God,

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:23.875
like rakshasas and devils,

00:48:24.291 --> 00:48:29.000
and keeps you clean, out of all these bad hands.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.375
Another very good aspect of Mahamaya is

00:48:35.875 --> 00:48:38.583
that She transforms you.

00:48:39.166 --> 00:48:42.166
Everything is in the brain for human beings.

00:48:42.583 --> 00:48:46.000
If you are a crook, you're a crook in the brain.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.333
If you are a person who hates others, it's all in the brain.

00:48:53.208 --> 00:48:58.917
If you are a addict to something, it's all in the brain.

00:49:00.834 --> 00:49:06.041
It's a very complicated conditioning in the head.

00:49:07.208 --> 00:49:10.750
So this Sahasrara is very important, no doubt,

00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:17.834
but the power of Virata and Viratangana

00:49:18.999 --> 00:49:23.667
can only be effective if there is Mahamaya rupa.

00:49:25.291 --> 00:49:30.291
And She, in Her own sweet ways, opens,

00:49:31.709 --> 00:49:35.166
dislodges all these conditionings

00:49:35.959 --> 00:49:38.000
which make you ugly,

00:49:38.417 --> 00:49:41.458
which make you horrible,

00:49:42.041 --> 00:49:45.458
which makes you hot tempered,

00:49:47.125 --> 00:49:49.166
non-Sahaja yogis.

00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:54.375
She's the one who really, like the Mother Earth,

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.834
gives all that She has,

00:49:58.291 --> 00:50:05.041
to make you really very joyous, happy,

00:50:06.166 --> 00:50:12.333
so that you enjoy nirananda - nothing but ananda,

00:50:13.667 --> 00:50:16.792
nothing but joy.

00:50:17.625 --> 00:50:22.000
And this is what is the Sahasrara.

00:50:22.417 --> 00:50:25.000
But it's only possible

00:50:26.875 --> 00:50:31.000
when your brahmarandhra is to be opened out;

00:50:31.542 --> 00:50:35.834
otherwise you cannot enter into the subtleties

00:50:36.417 --> 00:50:40.458
of divine love, compassion,

00:50:40.959 --> 00:50:45.834
of that ever-flowing Mahamaya.

00:50:46.999 --> 00:50:49.999
From the outside I have told you what She is,

00:50:50.417 --> 00:50:55.999
but from inside when you enter, penetrate into Her

00:50:58.917 --> 00:51:00.959
through the brahmarandhra,

00:51:01.458 --> 00:51:06.333
then this Mahamaya which is an incarnation, as you know,

00:51:06.875 --> 00:51:10.375
of this all-pervading Power,

00:51:11.333 --> 00:51:14.250
becomes very different.

00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:18.875
On one side She tries to teach you lessons,

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:22.208
She tries to destroy that is evil,

00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:25.875
all that is harmful, all that is destructive;

00:51:26.375 --> 00:51:31.834
and on the other side She loves you, protects you,

00:51:33.291 --> 00:51:36.250
very delicately guides you.

00:51:37.083 --> 00:51:42.250
Her love is without any expectations.

00:51:42.667 --> 00:51:46.291
She loves because She cannot help but to love.

00:51:47.375 --> 00:51:50.625
So in that love you are drenched.

00:51:51.166 --> 00:51:52.583
You enjoy it.

00:51:52.999 --> 00:51:59.041
Everybody knows that they are close to Her,

00:52:00.166 --> 00:52:01.999
absolutely close to Her.

00:52:02.417 --> 00:52:05.417
Whenever they want they can always ask Her help;

00:52:05.917 --> 00:52:09.458
wherever they are, they are supported by Her.

00:52:10.166 --> 00:52:12.999
So this Sahasrara is very important,

00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:16.500
because through this only we react,

00:52:17.041 --> 00:52:19.792
through this we accumulate

00:52:21.542 --> 00:52:23.291
all kinds of nonsense.

00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:26.792
In the world of this nonsense that we are living,

00:52:27.208 --> 00:52:30.166
we have to be something like the lotuses

00:52:30.792 --> 00:52:33.000
who cannot be tarnished,

00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:36.291
who cannot be affected

00:52:36.792 --> 00:52:40.166
by all the ills that are going on.

00:52:40.834 --> 00:52:44.041
This is what is the test, is the pariksha,

00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:46.667
that at this time,

00:52:47.125 --> 00:52:49.875
at this difficult time

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:52.875
we can blossom

00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:56.333
and create fragrance,

00:52:56.792 --> 00:53:01.959
and get so many others to this beautiful atmosphere.

00:53:03.083 --> 00:53:06.083
It is a kind

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:13.458
of a beautiful, playful war, I - we can say,

00:53:15.959 --> 00:53:20.041
against what is supposed to be negative.

00:53:20.542 --> 00:53:23.000
What is the power of this negativity?

00:53:23.542 --> 00:53:25.667
What is the power of these conditionings?

00:53:26.125 --> 00:53:30.917
What is the power of this stupidity that anybody can see?

00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:38.041
So you develop the sight, the vision.

00:53:39.291 --> 00:53:42.792
So clearly, you understand so clearly

00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:47.166
that you are the ones who are responsible.

00:53:47.709 --> 00:53:53.166
You are the cells of this Sahasrara, of this brain,

00:53:53.709 --> 00:53:55.583
and you all have to act.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.875
I was yesterday enamored when you said

00:53:59.375 --> 00:54:03.750
that these lights have to enlighten many lights.

00:54:04.458 --> 00:54:07.417
This was really a great promise to Me.

00:54:07.917 --> 00:54:09.083
So coming to Sahaja Yoga

00:54:09.417 --> 00:54:13.750
is not just for your personal limited

00:54:14.583 --> 00:54:16.750
personalities and their problems,

00:54:17.166 --> 00:54:21.500
but as I said, it's you

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.125
on one side has to grow,

00:54:24.583 --> 00:54:27.417
and on the other side

00:54:28.166 --> 00:54:31.750
everyone has to grow through you.

00:54:32.291 --> 00:54:36.750
So this is the second side which you should look after.

00:54:37.625 --> 00:54:40.291
Today of course I am very happy

00:54:40.792 --> 00:54:42.834
that in My lifetime I could see

00:54:43.291 --> 00:54:46.875
the manifestation of Mahamaya.

00:54:47.333 --> 00:54:49.333
It's such a beautiful one,

00:54:49.792 --> 00:54:52.375
that this door that is opened

00:54:53.041 --> 00:54:57.375
is now just

00:54:58.625 --> 00:55:02.750
able to enter into the Kingdom of God,

00:55:03.250 --> 00:55:07.458
and to enjoy the heavenly bliss and the protection.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.917
But have faith in it.

00:55:10.333 --> 00:55:12.208
Have faith in it.

00:55:12.625 --> 00:55:16.291
Do not get disturbed by small things,

00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:19.959
and I am sure it will work out in a very great way.

00:55:20.333 --> 00:55:25.000
If you get that complete faith

00:55:27.417 --> 00:55:32.834
and a complete surrendering,

00:55:33.542 --> 00:55:36.333
I am sure it will work out very well.

00:55:36.875 --> 00:55:40.834
May God bless you.

00:55:56.917 --> 00:56:04.333
So we'll have a little Ganesh Puja and then Sahasrara Puja.
