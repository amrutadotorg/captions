00:09.960 --> 00:14.880
You are becoming [KIDS?], I don't know why.

00:16.820 --> 00:20.360
The getting your presents was the problem.

00:20.540 --> 00:23.480
[UNCLEAR]

00:23.660 --> 00:26.760
Sorry for late.

00:26.940 --> 00:31.300
We are searching your presents.

00:35.500 --> 00:39.360
Beautiful place you have.

00:44.620 --> 00:48.600
Sorry we took so much time. [UNCLEAR]

00:52.160 --> 00:56.220
We were busy locating your presents.

00:56.480 --> 01:00.500
It is your duty to look after them.

01:03.640 --> 01:06.720
The programs should be such, that

01:06.900 --> 01:11.080
you should work them out inside Helsinki,

01:11.280 --> 01:16.920
as well as you should go out into smaller cities.

01:25.960 --> 01:31.080
And one thing is very important, how you [LEAVE?] with the group.

01:31.280 --> 01:34.860
It's very important.

01:38.580 --> 01:43.100
You must get rid of your ego, first of all.

01:44.820 --> 01:48.440
And in Sahaja yoga you should never say, "You are a bhoot",

01:48.600 --> 01:52.040
or things like that.

01:53.580 --> 01:59.060
Or, "You are possessed." Just talk on chakras.

02:00.080 --> 02:04.200
That chakra is caught, that chakra is caught.

02:07.340 --> 02:12.000
Also you should cleanse yourself at home.

02:14.740 --> 02:19.300
And also in the collectivity.

02:19.520 --> 02:25.220
All the ladies, specially, must know everything about Sahaja yoga.

02:27.900 --> 02:34.060
Men know everything, but women are the... They are more emotional.

02:36.880 --> 02:40.480
You must know each and everything. Which chakra is where,

02:40.640 --> 02:43.680
on the feet where they are, on the body where they are,

02:43.840 --> 02:47.280
inside where they are. What are they, everything.

02:47.440 --> 02:51.660
So you could have a course like that.

03:02.620 --> 03:07.280
You will have to be very gentle, compassionate,

03:14.040 --> 03:19.480
and not to say things that will hurt them.

03:22.360 --> 03:29.640
That will really make them feel that these are different people.

03:33.620 --> 03:38.980
Moreover, sahaja yogis should never contradict among themselves.

03:46.120 --> 03:52.540
But when it comes to argument, better not have it with others.

03:56.260 --> 03:59.880
But somebody is aggressive, then you all should join together.

04:00.040 --> 04:04.420
Do not support the other one, because he is negative.

04:06.980 --> 04:12.600
Support your leader, always. Support the leader.

04:15.380 --> 04:19.240
If I find anything wrong with the leader, I'll remove him.

04:19.460 --> 04:23.160
But you donÂ´t fight with your leader.

04:40.620 --> 04:45.080
[SOUNDS LIKE: STACKILY?] you have a very good leader, I would say.

04:53.560 --> 04:58.320
Any problems, anything, you can always write to me.

05:00.900 --> 05:04.520
And you should try to cure people,

05:04.680 --> 05:08.840
but don't touch them, use the photograph.

05:13.520 --> 05:16.920
You can give balance, you can give chakras bandhans,

05:17.080 --> 05:20.560
but don't touch them.

05:24.100 --> 05:29.060
The most important thing is taking a bandhan. Very important.

05:30.480 --> 05:34.540
Before going out of the house, before sleeping,

05:34.740 --> 05:39.580
before addressing the people.

05:46.600 --> 05:50.700
Or treating someone. When you are treating somebody,

05:50.900 --> 05:55.960
take yourself a bandhan, give that person a bandhan, and then do it.

06:01.820 --> 06:04.740
That will help you.

06:04.920 --> 06:08.400
Now for example, if her sisters are doing like that,

06:08.580 --> 06:11.500
you take her name, and give her a bandhan. It will work out.

06:11.680 --> 06:15.560
You have one sister only?
Yogi: Two sisters.

06:28.540 --> 06:32.960
Instead of arguing, let's just to give bandhan.

06:35.120 --> 06:38.940
Now, there are some little presents I could manage to bring.

06:39.120 --> 06:42.740
[WAS?] traveling of six countries all around

06:42.940 --> 06:46.580
and just sharing five [PIECES?]. I've been able to save some things.

06:46.760 --> 06:49.880
Yogi: Shri Mataji, this is all too much... [UNCLEAR]

06:50.060 --> 06:55.000
Shri Mataji: No, no, no. It's is a just I... just little small.

07:05.780 --> 07:08.800
Thank you very much.

07:10.220 --> 07:14.380
Yogi: And then, Shri Mataji, Thou said in Kundalini Puja,

07:14.560 --> 07:20.840
when we were giving that silver kumbha as the puja present, and

07:21.020 --> 07:26.320
there was a duck. Thou said that "in Finland there are lot of ducks,

07:26.460 --> 07:30.740
and even the ducks could not have that much discrimination."

07:30.940 --> 07:35.480
After this, we have got this much discrimination that

07:35.680 --> 07:38.500
we are willing to give Thou...

07:38.660 --> 07:43.680
Yogi: Here are You! [Yogi giving a figurine of swan to Shri Mataji.]

07:49.960 --> 07:53.340
Shri Mataji: You have swans.
Yogi: Yes.

07:53.520 --> 07:56.580
Shri Mataji: You ['LL?] have the maximum number of swans.

07:56.740 --> 07:59.660
So the [NISHANG? - detached way of life, ed.] should be much more.

07:59.840 --> 08:02.540
The swans are known. ['S SAY?]

08:02.720 --> 08:07.940
There is a couplet in Sanskrit. Beautiful.

08:08.840 --> 08:14.240
What a balance. What a balance.

08:26.400 --> 08:30.300
And there is a couplet. Very good.

08:30.500 --> 08:34.840
[SANSKRIT: Hansa ha kshkad ha, bakha ha kshkad ha]. In Sanskrit.

08:35.040 --> 08:40.240
[SANSKRIT: Hansa ha hansaksh, baka ha baka ha. Ko bhedo hansa bakayo ho.]

08:40.480 --> 08:42.140
The...

08:47.660 --> 08:51.600
What is that bird which... which stands on one foot?

08:51.760 --> 08:54.020
Yogi: It's "haikara". ["STORK" IN FINNISH]

08:54.200 --> 08:58.960
So the stork is white and the swan is also white.

08:59.160 --> 09:02.640
What is the difference between the swan.

09:02.820 --> 09:06.640
Hansa. Hansa is... is swans. Hansa.

09:06.860 --> 09:08.800
The Hamsa chakra.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.160
Hansa are swans.

09:12.340 --> 09:16.360
And bakaha are the stork.

09:16.540 --> 09:19.540
But I can't remember the name. It's other. [IT IS "CRANE", ed. note]

09:19.720 --> 09:24.460
So they are all white. But what is the difference between them?

09:24.640 --> 09:29.480
The difference is [SANSKRIT: Needa ksheeram bhedu.]

09:29.660 --> 09:32.880
If you put water and milk together,

09:33.060 --> 09:36.260
the swan will just take the milk.

09:36.460 --> 09:41.880
When the discretion between the water and the milk is to be done,

09:42.060 --> 09:45.060
then "Hansa ha hansa, ha baka habka."

09:45.240 --> 09:48.300
Then hansa remains hansa, [SANSKRIT: baka ri baka?].

09:48.480 --> 09:53.220
When it is the discretion between water and milk.

10:23.900 --> 10:28.720
That's why it's swan. Swan is in India respected very much.

10:28.920 --> 10:32.440
Because it is divine bird. It has discretion.

10:32.640 --> 10:36.900
It can separate the water from milk.

10:46.480 --> 10:49.540
And that's why I told him that, "It was fine discretion.

10:49.720 --> 10:54.820
You should look at Finland!"
Yogi: What is..?

10:55.000 --> 10:59.580
Shri Mataji: You should look at Finland for divine discretion.

11:10.800 --> 11:17.320
It's a Hamsa chakra in it. It's a Hamsa chakra. Aa.

11:17.500 --> 11:22.500
Yogi: What?
Shri Mataji: It's a Hamsa chakra. [IDA NAA?]

11:23.220 --> 11:26.400
Yogi: You know, I thought this is Agnya.
Shri Mataji: Ha?

11:26.580 --> 11:32.060
No, no, no, no, no. Agnya is only in Russia and China.

11:36.640 --> 11:40.420
But this is Hamsa chakra.

11:41.880 --> 11:46.300
Marion, you got something [TO ME]? Oh...!
