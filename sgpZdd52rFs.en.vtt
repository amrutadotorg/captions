1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280
Okay, good evening.

2
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.240
I propose that we go through this thing in three parts.

3
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:24.800
First I will speak a bit, then we can have question and answer.

4
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.320
Anything you want?

5
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.000
And thirdly I would like to finish with a little meditation which is related to the

6
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
subject.

7
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:43.320
This is a puja of Lord Jesus Christ which, as you know, Sri Ganesha has become Christ

8
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.080
at the level of the Agnya.

9
00:00:48.080 --> 00:01:02.320
So it is a good moment to speak about some challenges which face the Yuva.

10
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:13.840
In Kabela there have been Yuvas who have been misbehaving according to our principle.

11
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:24.600
They slept with girls, girls slept with boys, but it's not acceptable.

12
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:32.360
So I'm going to try to explain one or two things simply.

13
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.320
The first thing I want you to understand is this.

14
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.760
We all need good luck.

15
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.840
Maybe you work for your exams but you are not sure you are going to pass.

16
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:58.440
If you start your job you don't know whether you are going to be successful.

17
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.800
And in relationship you don't know whether the man or the woman you love is going to

18
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.480
make you suffer.

19
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.960
So we need some good luck.

20
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:23.880
There is a trick to obtain good luck.

21
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:32.120
The name of the trick is auspiciousness.

22
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.880
And auspiciousness is the blessing of?

23
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:59.280
So, you see, Sri Mataji said that Freud is a rakshasa who came to destroy Christianity.

24
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:07.680
Why?

25
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:15.600
Because the destiny of human being is to realize himself.

26
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:25.160
To find the plenitude of satisfaction and joy.

27
00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:32.560
Actually I wrote the advent for two reasons.

28
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:48.680
First is because Sri Mataji agreed and second because she gave me a very powerful experience.

29
00:03:48.680 --> 00:04:03.720
Because when you feel very good in Sahaja you feel the joy in a gazelle state.

30
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.960
This is in the sixth chapter of the Gyaneshwari.

31
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:18.120
Sri Gyaneshwari says that in the upper chakras the Kundalini is felt in a gazelle state.

32
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:26.680
So you feel light, you feel joyful, you feel like hugging everybody.

33
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.560
It's light.

34
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:40.680
When you get the full experience of the Kundalini, the full experience in the Sahasran, then

35
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.680
the joy is no longer in a gazelle state.

36
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.880
The joy becomes in a liquid state.

37
00:04:51.880 --> 00:05:02.080
And it is called Amrut in Sanskrit or Amrosia in English.

38
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.160
And the gods and the rakshasas fought for it when they wanted it.

39
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:12.800
It was then called Soma.

40
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:28.440
So it is a complete shower of bliss which flows in every cell of your body.

41
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:35.240
It is spiritual but it is also physical.

42
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:48.120
And actually the notion of physical intensity for human beings is captured in English in

43
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:56.280
the word orgasm.

44
00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.520
This is a fraction.

45
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.360
Because the Mooladhara chakra is outside of the spine so you just feel a little fraction

46
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:14.160
of this panel.

47
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:23.440
So what I'm trying to say is that even if what we want is physical pleasure, through

48
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:31.200
spiritual evolution, we have much more physical pleasure.

49
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:46.880
But integrated in the purity of a sacred state.

50
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:59.160
Yes, this is why I wrote the Advent.

51
00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:07.520
I was going to leave Shri Mataji and I felt very depressed.

52
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:13.880
Because I felt I will not be able to maintain my realization.

53
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:21.900
And I was sitting like from here to this lady from Shri Mataji.

54
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:27.320
I was on a chair, she was on a chair.

55
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:34.640
And she looked at me and she said, you should not be sad.

56
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:48.000
And she moved her hand like this.

57
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.200
I never ever felt this after that.

58
00:07:54.200 --> 00:08:03.360
Because I did not have a right to feel this by my own evolution.

59
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.360
But she just gave it to me because she is the Param.

60
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:16.600
She gave it to me so that I know it is real.

61
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:27.480
So if you behave properly, there is an incredible Shat Skamma, there is an incredible house

62
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:38.260
of treasure in the limbic area of your brain.

63
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:48.760
Some are trying to rob, like go into it like thieves by taking drugs.

64
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.820
Beta will not talk about drugs today.

65
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:57.820
So let us return to sexuality.

66
00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:11.460
Let us return to real life.

67
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:23.780
Basically the theory of Freud is that if you want to find yourself, you have to find yourself

68
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.860
through sex.

69
00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:37.260
And this has been influencing the Western world and the world since the first half of

70
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
the 20th century.

71
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:51.780
But it is a very limited understanding of our potential.

72
00:09:51.780 --> 00:10:14.020
Now, you are you and you are at an age where these things start interesting your curiosity.

73
00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:22.340
Maybe among you there are girls who have already slept with boys or boys who have already

74
00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.860
slept with boys.

75
00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.580
There are some people inside Juga who say, well you shouldn't be Taliban, you shouldn't

76
00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:38.180
be fanatics, it is alright.

77
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:42.940
The problem is the leaders are not those who have established the standard.

78
00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:52.260
The standards have been established by Sri Ganesha.

79
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:58.180
So if we keep within the realm of Sri Ganesha, we will have the auspiciousness and we will

80
00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:05.560
have His blessings.

81
00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:17.240
If you don't live by the standard of Sri Ganesha, I am not going to judge you.

82
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:30.600
But I am trying to explain that you benefit from the blessings when you are on the territory

83
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:41.440
of the deity, not when you are outside of the territory of the deity.

84
00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:53.520
So if you are intelligently egoist, you do what is best for you.

85
00:11:53.520 --> 00:12:05.200
Even if the boy is charming, even if he wants to sleep with you, you have to understand,

86
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.480
what do you give, what do you gain?

87
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:13.840
You give much more than what you gain.

88
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.880
It is not a good business.

89
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:30.280
Now some people say, okay, maybe we should not sleep, but a kiss is alright.

90
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:35.840
It's like when I eat, if I don't eat in the morning, if I don't eat my breakfast, I am

91
00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:36.840
not hungry.

92
00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:46.420
But if I eat a little piece of bread, I want more.

93
00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:52.580
I don't know about the girls, but the boys are like that.

94
00:12:52.580 --> 00:13:02.980
So the thing is, if you start kissing, you lower your defense system.

95
00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:14.180
You see, one way I tried to help my son when he was a teenager is to put his ego on the

96
00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:19.180
side of dharma.

97
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:27.340
Seduction is like a power play.

98
00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:37.400
You see, so you need to be able to defend yourself.

99
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:42.660
And for this you have to control the eyes.

100
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:52.100
You control seduction and dance through the eyes.

101
00:13:52.100 --> 00:14:00.220
If you control your attention, you cannot be seduced.

102
00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.720
You cannot be seduced.

103
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:15.780
So you have to become masters of fencing.

104
00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:25.900
You have sex education in school, which is one of the greatest stupidity which could

105
00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.940
ever exist.

106
00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:40.280
Now, you are, do you know how many times you were born before?

107
00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:45.520
Do you know how many times you have been married?

108
00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:53.120
Do you know how many hundred of thousand times you had sex?

109
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.800
So it's not so complicated.

110
00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.420
And the moment will come, you will know.

111
00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:05.420
You don't need to have a PhD in this.

112
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:09.420
You don't need to look at movies.

113
00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:13.740
And you should not go into pornography.

114
00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:20.120
All of you know that with a computer you can get there in three minutes.

115
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:34.860
You see, if you have a white sheet and you put ink on it, putting ink is very fast.

116
00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:40.140
Taking the ink off takes a lot of time.

117
00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.140
You understand?

118
00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:42.140
You understand?

119
00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:47.940
This is, remember that about pornography.

120
00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:56.980
So if some of you have gone on the weather and you have looked at notice things, try

121
00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:02.660
to understand it weakens your attention.

122
00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:09.680
Because you see, the devil is a cunning fellow.

123
00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:17.340
He is trying to ride on things which are powerful.

124
00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:23.220
And sex is a powerful thing.

125
00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:27.300
It's not a bad thing.

126
00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:32.220
All the great rishis were married.

127
00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:37.140
Only in the Catholic Church, maybe in the Orthodox Church, the priests are not married,

128
00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:38.140
right?

129
00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:43.460
In the Catholic Church they are not married.

130
00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:50.500
Pornography was invented in the north of Europe, not in the south.

131
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.700
In Denmark and in Sweden.

132
00:16:54.700 --> 00:17:02.420
Because you had a very repressed Lutherian religion.

133
00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:09.180
So the solution is not to negate sex.

134
00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:16.060
The best definition of sex I heard it from my guru.

135
00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:29.100
Shrimataji said, the fire which cook your food can burn your house.

136
00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:34.860
Now do you want to use the fire to cook your food or do you want the fire to burn your

137
00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:38.940
house?

138
00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.980
The choice is yours.

139
00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:46.740
You can always seduce a boy.

140
00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:50.260
You can always seduce a girl.

141
00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.580
And you say, why lover?

142
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.580
Oh he loves me?

143
00:17:55.580 --> 00:18:00.580
I cannot say no.

144
00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:06.260
But what you give is less than what you get.

145
00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.020
So be a good businessman.

146
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:26.180
Keep your assets until you will exchange with the maximum blessings.

147
00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:35.420
So your married life will be blessed.

148
00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:43.580
You know what is a blessing when you are married?

149
00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:49.260
A very big blessing.

150
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:56.300
And you have no control over this.

151
00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:00.140
It's to have good children.

152
00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:06.380
Because you can choose with whom you have sex.

153
00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:10.320
That is a woman.

154
00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.100
And as a young mother.

155
00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:21.060
You cannot choose who is going to come into your womb.

156
00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:28.780
You do not know whether it is going to be an angel or a rakshasa.

157
00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:34.020
And rakshas are being born to human beings.

158
00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:44.020
So how do you do to make sure that you get good kids?

159
00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:54.020
You maintain a good working relationship with the one who does the traffic control.

160
00:19:54.020 --> 00:20:06.340
And the one who does the traffic control is?

161
00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:12.180
So I know it is hard.

162
00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:20.540
One day before this universe there were other universes.

163
00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.900
She said yes.

164
00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:28.460
And I said so before our Kali Yuga there were other Kali Yuga.

165
00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:35.860
And then I saw how is our Kali Yuga in comparison with the other ones.

166
00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:43.780
She said this one is one of the worst.

167
00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:52.660
The West is completely destroyed because of the sin against the Malatara chakra.

168
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:59.500
And now they are losing their wealth.

169
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:03.780
And they go back into poverty.

170
00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:08.740
You are a little bit better than in the West but the West is very much here.

171
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:12.740
In Dubai you have Ukrainian allied flight.

172
00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:15.740
The door opens, beautiful women come out.

173
00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.740
They are all Ukrainian and they are all for the Arab.

174
00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:39.740
So you are also on the attack?

175
00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:46.740
The city is a very unpopular world.

176
00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:51.740
This is a trick of the devil of course.

177
00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:59.740
Because he cannot touch someone who is chaste.

178
00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:02.740
So of course the devil is clever.

179
00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:27.740
He will create trends with Mr. Freud and others which will lead to the fact that chastity is not trendy.

180
00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:32.740
So this was a little introduction.

181
00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:35.740
Can I stop here?

182
00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:39.740
You can ask any question you want.

183
00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:47.740
And then we can have a little meditation.

184
00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:51.740
Have you ever met people like Freud?

185
00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:58.740
I met a psychiatrist and I had friends who were gay.

186
00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:14.740
I know the sin.

187
00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:24.740
Is it possible to change?

188
00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.740
Yes, it is possible to change.

189
00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:34.740
There is a woman who was a prostitute.

190
00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:43.740
And she is now married in Saajjoga and she has children and she is very happy.

191
00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:49.740
But people who are gay and there are no more gay.

192
00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:56.740
That doesn't mean that you need to be a prostitute to try.

193
00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:59.740
So we don't judge.

194
00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:05.740
If a girl comes and tells me I slept with a boy,

195
00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.740
I am not going to judge her.

196
00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:13.740
I am not going to hate her as a sajj elder.

197
00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:29.740
But I am sad for her because I wish that she can protect the potential for high evolution.

198
00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:37.740
Even if you make a mistake and you understand it is a mistake,

199
00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:41.740
the divan is forgiven.

200
00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:46.740
But if you make a mistake as a yogi,

201
00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:53.740
it is a little bit dangerous because you are in the attention of the divan.

202
00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:59.740
So you are in the attention of Shriganesha and you insult him.

203
00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.740
It is not very smart.

204
00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:08.740
And everything can be forgiven.

205
00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:16.740
But if there is no repentance,

206
00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:22.740
the forgiveness is wasted.

207
00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:30.740
But I would say even if you have fallen, never give up.

208
00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:38.740
Always come back on the back of your horse.

209
00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:42.740
The horse of your attention.

210
00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:46.740
Because it is all in the attention.

211
00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:49.740
It is all in the attention.

212
00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:58.740
It is a battle in the attention.

213
00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:10.740
You see, you will enjoy life so much more if you can manage to remain chaste until you marry.

214
00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:17.740
Now, in sajaja yoga you have system A, system B.

215
00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:24.740
System A is that you marry in sajaja yoga, which is not so easy for you because

216
00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:30.740
we need to improve the marriage system so that we can also have marriages in Ukraine.

217
00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.740
Or in Russia.

218
00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:49.740
But the committee who does it really needs to be right.

219
00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:57.740
Otherwise it is other problems.

220
00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:01.740
So system A is you marry in sajaja yoga.

221
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:08.740
System B is you choose your partner.

222
00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:11.740
It is permitted.

223
00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:15.740
But you should not choose it in sajaja yoga.

224
00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:25.740
Because there are two foundations in sajaja yoga of our society.

225
00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:34.740
One is the brother and sister relationship.

226
00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:39.740
The other one is husband and wife relationship.

227
00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.740
Both are beautiful.

228
00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:44.740
Both are powerful.

229
00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.740
Both are powerful.

230
00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:50.740
And if we mix the two,

231
00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:56.740
we create complications.

232
00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.740
Another question?

233
00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:13.740
What is wrong about system A? Is there some...

234
00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:15.740
Is it not acceptable?

235
00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:22.740
System A is alright, but Shri Mataji is no more here.

236
00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:30.740
So for me it was easy because Shri Mataji asked my wife,

237
00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:35.740
do you want to marry Gregoire? I had no doubt that she wanted that, right?

238
00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:43.740
But now she is not yet to do that.

239
00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:52.740
So we have an international marriage committee where people look at the file and take the vibration.

240
00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:02.740
And that works because Shri Mataji helps in the niraka form.

241
00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:15.740
But it has to be within the context of the collective.

242
00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:25.740
If a group somewhere starts organizing its own little committee, I don't know whether it will be blessed.

243
00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:36.740
Now we have a generation of yugas who are parents.

244
00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:39.740
Like my kids, they are parents now.

245
00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:46.740
And they really have beautiful children.

246
00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:55.740
And you know, the greatest beauty in this beautiful world is beautiful human beings.

247
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.740
So why not desire the best?

248
00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.740
And we have to get the best.

249
00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:12.740
You have another question? I am getting tired of listening to myself.

250
00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:39.740
The question is not exactly about the ludara.

251
00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:46.740
The question is about how the Sahaja Yoga will stabilize after Shri Mataji is not here anymore.

252
00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.740
What is the responsibility of the yuva shakti?

253
00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:00.740
They made a survey of yugas.

254
00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:05.740
The yugas made a survey of yugas.

255
00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:10.740
And there were questions, did you have sex?

256
00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:13.740
Did you take drugs?

257
00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:16.740
Did you take alcohol?

258
00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:30.740
The most interesting response is that those who were coming from Sahaja families were worse than those who were not coming from Sahaja families.

259
00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:39.740
And it is logical.

260
00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:49.740
Because if you are a young person and you come to Sahaja and your papa and your mama is not in Sahaja, you wanted to be in Sahaja, your ego is with it.

261
00:31:49.740 --> 00:32:05.740
But if your papa and mama is in Sahaja, the only thing you can do is be in Sahaja, you know it is a bit boring, you want to do something else.

262
00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:34.740
So one moment to talk about how much our mind and that blind life effect on our chakra and life, what are our experiences with living under the blind?

263
00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:43.740
What is the relationship between our relationship and our relationship with our body?

264
00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:58.740
The major, and this psychoanalysis found out, that the major catches that we have come from our family, therefore our parents and our janitors.

265
00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:17.740
For instance, if you are an incest in the family, you are cursed for seven generations.

266
00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:30.740
So when we are born, we have taken a risk. It was very brave to be born.

267
00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:39.740
But now that we are here, we need to deal with it, right?

268
00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:51.740
So as yogis we can repair, we can self-maintain, we can repair the pipes, we can repair the channels, we can repair the chakras.

269
00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:03.740
One day I told Shri Mataji that I was afraid I had lost my innocence.

270
00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:13.740
She told me, Gregoire, it is not easy for you to lose your innocence.

271
00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:20.740
That was the good news.

272
00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:33.740
But she says that innocence is like the sky and the sky is clouded, but the clouds eventually can go away, the sky is always there.

273
00:34:40.740 --> 00:35:01.740
So that's why I'm telling you, even if you have difficulties, even if you have made mistakes, even if your attention is not very good, never give up, because the sky is always there.

274
00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:04.740
And Shri Ganesh is always there.

275
00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:10.740
He is ready to help us if we allow him to.

276
00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:32.740
The room is hot.

277
00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:37.740
And I don't want to keep you too long.

278
00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:40.740
So we could talk about many things.

279
00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.740
But then the adults are going to be jealous.

280
00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:52.740
If I start to explain to you in what moment we are now in Sahaja Yoga,

281
00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:07.740
if I have to talk to you in what are the challenges facing the global Sangha,

282
00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:17.740
if I have to explain the tricks of the devil,

283
00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:23.740
I open a parenthesis.

284
00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:35.740
Shri Mataji made me the leader of the USA.

285
00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:40.740
Some time back.

286
00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:46.740
And she tells me, I am making you the leader of the USA because you are the one who knows hell best.

287
00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:56.740
So I feel I can speak about the tricks of the devil.

288
00:36:56.740 --> 00:37:00.740
If I do all this, then it is not fair for me to keep the adults up.

289
00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:12.740
So we limit the leading of the...

290
00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:16.740
The lady over there.

291
00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:36.740
It's a question of the Mayan were the best astronomers.

292
00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:44.740
So it was not the end of the world, it was the end of a cycle.

293
00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:54.740
In both the Koran and the Bible there is a moment which is a big catharsis.

294
00:37:56.740 --> 00:38:03.740
And Shri Mataji did say, please take Sahaja Yoga seriously, there is very little time left.

295
00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:09.740
What did she mean?

296
00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:12.740
We don't know.

297
00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:21.740
What did Shri Mataji say about Ukrainians and Ukrainian land?

298
00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:23.740
What did Shri Mataji say about Ukrainians and Ukrainian land?

299
00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:40.740
She said that we are an ancient people.

300
00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:55.740
We have a problem. We have a problem with the earth.

301
00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:57.740
What problem?

302
00:38:58.740 --> 00:38:59.740
We have a story.

303
00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.740
We have a story that we don't have.

304
00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:05.740
What?

305
00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:07.740
We have a problem with the earth.

306
00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:09.740
What?

307
00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:11.740
We have a problem with the earth.

308
00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:13.740
We have a problem with the earth.

309
00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:19.740
The question is that you are the king of the problems that the young people are facing.

310
00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:26.740
And the question is that you are the king of the problems that the young people are facing.

311
00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:30.740
The answer is, don't do it.

312
00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:36.740
You have to help your left side with the right side.

313
00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:44.740
Will power and discipline is a quality coming from Shrikat Tika.

314
00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:51.740
You have to use this to protect your left side.

315
00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:56.740
There are some people who are addicted to pornography.

316
00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:07.740
And this is now known in the medical profession.

317
00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:13.740
So avoid doing, avoid pressing the button.

318
00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:27.740
First of all, I was impressed by the creativity and the sense of art.

319
00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:33.740
And the lady who did the backdrop, the man who did the backdrop is really wonderful.

320
00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:47.740
The play yesterday was extremely moving.

321
00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:53.740
When the children came towards the end of the play, there is really something which opened up.

322
00:40:53.740 --> 00:41:04.740
And I really felt as if Jesus and Shri Mataji were pleased.

323
00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:13.740
And the music group is very strong.

324
00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:19.740
So you come across as a mature collectivity.

325
00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:28.740
As far as the puja is concerned, it was a workout.

326
00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:33.740
Because in Slav countries you have divisions.

327
00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:40.740
Here also, but especially in Russia.

328
00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:47.740
And all these divisions are to keep you blocked at the level of the yagya channel.

329
00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:55.740
Because it is the last gate.

330
00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:02.740
So of course, if we pass the last gate, we are home.

331
00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:10.740
If the children are home, then they are going to be powerful.

332
00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:17.740
And if I am the delilah, I don't want the children to be powerful.

333
00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:26.740
So Shri Mataji said that the worst is anger.

334
00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:32.740
But I say the worst is jealousy.

335
00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:39.740
Because it is the enemy of the vishuddhi and of collectivity.

336
00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:45.740
And so all these things need to be worked out through the vibration.

337
00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:52.740
But at the end, we were pushed through.

338
00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:58.740
That's why you all felt the joy and you were hopping like little rabbits.

339
00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:06.740
So it was a good puja.

340
00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:09.740
But it was hard work.

341
00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:11.740
Last question.

342
00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:15.740
Shri Mataji was in Ukraine the last time, it was 1996.

343
00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:19.740
And she said you have to work hard.

344
00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:21.740
What she means about that?

345
00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:26.740
How long it will take to help all our country?

346
00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:28.740
What she means by that?

347
00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:30.740
She is a very good person.

348
00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:32.740
She is a very good person.

349
00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:34.740
She is a very good person.

350
00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:36.740
She is a very good person.

351
00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:38.740
And she is very good.

352
00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:40.740
She is very good.

353
00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:42.740
What step we are now?

354
00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:45.740
We are going to the bathroom.

355
00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:49.740
Okay. You have one room.

356
00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:53.740
It is Kali Yuga.

357
00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:55.740
You have one room.

358
00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:57.740
It is Satya Yuga.

359
00:43:58.740 --> 00:43:59.740
This is the age of darkness.

360
00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:03.740
This is the age of truth, the golden age.

361
00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:07.740
In between there is a corridor.

362
00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:10.740
And we are in this corridor.

363
00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:13.740
It is called Krita Yuga.

364
00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:16.740
And in Krita Yuga everything is exposed.

365
00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:25.740
That's why we get disgusted because everything is coming on.

366
00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:31.740
Every politician is corrupted.

367
00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:39.740
The people who should defend the benevolence of the nation are like a kleptomaniac mafia.

368
00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:46.740
Their families are destroyed.

369
00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:49.740
So we are not yet in the golden age.

370
00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:52.740
As we are in between.

371
00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:56.740
At the same time when we are together.

372
00:44:58.740 --> 00:44:59.740
The power is stronger now.

373
00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:04.740
Than in the beginning.

374
00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:08.740
We can go into the savannas much better now.

375
00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:12.740
Than in the beginning.

376
00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:25.740
So the gurus used to say, ask yourself a question, who am I?

377
00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:33.740
But one day we will need to ask ourselves a question, who are we?

378
00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:39.740
We will replace the I by the we.

379
00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:45.740
Because when we meditate together we are all in thoughtless awareness.

380
00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:53.740
You don't know where your consciousness finishes and where the consciousness of your neighbor starts.

381
00:45:53.740 --> 00:46:04.740
Because it's like the lights of two candles. You don't know where the light of one stops and the light of the other begins. But there is more light.

382
00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:13.740
So this is our future.

383
00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:15.740
More light.

384
00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:20.740
These are the last words of Goethe.

385
00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:30.740
Okay, good conclusion. Now, now, now.

386
00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:42.740
Now we are going to have a little exercise together, a little meditation.
