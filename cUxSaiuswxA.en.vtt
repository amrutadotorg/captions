00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.701
So these two conditionings,

00:00:14.767 --> 00:00:19.501
which actually are on the brain,

00:00:19.534 --> 00:00:24.200
these two conditions freeze the heart

00:00:24.267 --> 00:00:31.868
and also make the domain of heart as zero

00:00:31.934 --> 00:00:36.634
and then the brain starts asserting itself.

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:43.934
That is how we do not know how to be kind to others,

00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:46.400
how to be nice, how to be helpful,

00:00:46.434 --> 00:00:51.767
how to be gentle and how to be reassuring,

00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:55.701
protecting others.

00:00:56.634 --> 00:01:03.734
All this we have inherited already.

00:01:03.767 --> 00:01:07.701
We have already got a stone heart when we come to Sahaja Yoga

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:12.133
and we have a brain either full of ego or superego.

00:01:12.167 --> 00:01:14.901
So now, with your Kundalini rising,

00:01:14.968 --> 00:01:18.767
you can clear out your head, first of all.

00:01:18.834 --> 00:01:24.000
So, the sincerity will come when the Kundalini will move

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.734
and touch your Brahmarandra,

00:01:26.767 --> 00:01:31.334
which is the seat of your heart and will expand.

00:01:31.367 --> 00:01:34.000
Then the heart just comes back like a king,

00:01:34.067 --> 00:01:38.434
returns back and starts dominating the brain.

00:01:38.934 --> 00:01:41.067
And when the heart comes back,

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:44.300
you immediately find those people with whom we were angry,

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:46.934
we would not talk, we had nothing to do,

00:01:46.968 --> 00:01:48.634
suddenly, we become friendly with them.

00:01:48.667 --> 00:01:50.667
There's no problem.

00:01:50.734 --> 00:01:55.534
In many ways, people have harmed you.

00:01:55.567 --> 00:02:00.701
All that harming and everything just disappears.

00:02:00.734 --> 00:02:04.801
And you start becoming so nice and beautiful.

00:02:04.834 --> 00:02:07.334
What has happened that Kundalini has touched

00:02:07.367 --> 00:02:11.300
your Brahmarandra, where is the seat of heart.

00:02:11.334 --> 00:02:14.838
And as soon as that opens out, your heart also opens

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.100
and it gets awakened.

00:02:16.133 --> 00:02:20.801
It thinks 'Oh, what? I have allowed this brain to rule me?

00:02:20.834 --> 00:02:24.601
How dare it rules me!' It just jumps on it.

00:02:24.634 --> 00:02:27.234
And we have seen people:

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.934
suddenly, they're so much transformed that it's remarkable.

00:02:31.968 --> 00:02:35.367
There - one gentleman in America, he said that

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.100
'Mother, after Realization I was so much changed

00:02:40.133 --> 00:02:44.300
that I've become a very mild person

00:02:44.367 --> 00:02:47.601
and I never used to wish my uncle or anyone.'

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:50.868
So he met him in some sort of a fete and then he said,

00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:52.400
'Hello, uncle!'

00:02:52.434 --> 00:02:54.200
The uncle started looking at him.

00:02:54.267 --> 00:02:58.400
'Are you all right?' He would never say that.

00:02:58.434 --> 00:03:02.434
Then he went and saw: 'Are you all right, uncle? Are you keeping all right?

00:03:02.467 --> 00:03:05.400
Can I do something for you?' Very nice things he said.

00:03:05.467 --> 00:03:09.968
Uncle said, 'What have you been doing? Are you drunk or what?

00:03:10.033 --> 00:03:14.534
How can you speak so sweetly to me? I can't believe it.'

00:03:14.901 --> 00:03:16.734
That's what happens.

00:03:16.767 --> 00:03:19.234
And that's why we have to understand

00:03:19.267 --> 00:03:23.167
that all these things can be easily dropped out

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.167
because we have acquired them.

00:03:25.234 --> 00:03:28.501
They can be finished off because we have acquired them.

00:03:28.567 --> 00:03:33.334
They need not be all our lives, our relations.

00:03:33.367 --> 00:03:36.100
So, ego and superego, both can be

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:41.100
blasted off once your heart is awakened.

00:03:41.133 --> 00:03:44.901
So, when we are dealing with people,

00:03:44.934 --> 00:03:47.968
we have to break the ice also

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.934
by communicating with others in a very decent manner.

00:03:51.968 --> 00:03:54.734
Like telling yourself,

00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:57.334
'No, I don't believe that this man is so bad.

00:03:57.367 --> 00:04:00.567
Let me look after him, he may be all right.

00:04:00.601 --> 00:04:02.734
You see, I don't think he's so bad.'

00:04:02.767 --> 00:04:06.734
So, to accept somebody as bad is very easy for human beings

00:04:06.767 --> 00:04:09.400
and once they start accepting such a thing,

00:04:09.434 --> 00:04:11.868
then they build up a kind of a fortress in which they live

00:04:11.901 --> 00:04:15.167
and they think they are the best people

00:04:15.234 --> 00:04:17.868
and nobody else are good.

00:04:17.934 --> 00:04:22.200
And thus, the whole community, the whole society,

00:04:22.234 --> 00:04:28.200
the whole humanity gets bitten by these ideas.

00:04:30.934 --> 00:04:36.400
And Sahaja Yoga is the only way which is going to cure it.

00:04:37.234 --> 00:04:42.234
Sahaja Yoga is the only way which is going to finish this.

00:04:42.868 --> 00:04:49.501
And that part is to be played by you people,

00:04:49.567 --> 00:04:53.167
to understand that sincerity can only come

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.934
if you raise your Kundalini again and again

00:04:55.968 --> 00:04:59.667
and open your Brahmarandra.

00:04:59.701 --> 00:05:02.701
Then your heart will rise.

00:05:02.734 --> 00:05:08.234
It will become a very awakened personality

00:05:08.267 --> 00:05:10.567
and it will take charge of your brain,

00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:14.567
which is all the time thinking, thinking, thinking, like mad.

00:05:14.601 --> 00:05:18.100
And once that happens, then you will realize that

00:05:18.167 --> 00:05:22.501
now you have jumped into doubtless awareness.

00:05:23.834 --> 00:05:28.834
So, the relationship between the two has to be fully understood.

00:05:28.868 --> 00:05:31.501
At first, the domination of the heart

00:05:31.534 --> 00:05:35.934
or, we can say, the kinghood of heart is challenged,

00:05:35.968 --> 00:05:38.801
is put down, brought to zero.

00:05:38.834 --> 00:05:44.200
And then this brain becomes the king, and it starts ruling us.

00:05:44.234 --> 00:05:53.701
'I think...', 'I feel...' means the brain, the ego.

00:05:53.767 --> 00:05:56.901
If you could give up

00:05:56.968 --> 00:06:01.033
'I think...', 'I want...',

00:06:01.901 --> 00:06:05.534
everything will be all right. You should say:

00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:10.467
I want... is not the point. This body wants it.'

00:06:10.501 --> 00:06:12.133
You separate yourself.

00:06:12.167 --> 00:06:15.367
Gradually you start separating yourself

00:06:15.434 --> 00:06:18.734
from all such situations by never saying 'I want...'

00:06:18.767 --> 00:06:23.334
You should say, 'This body...', 'This hand...', 'This head...'

00:06:23.367 --> 00:06:25.334
You start separating.

00:06:25.367 --> 00:06:27.100
And once you have separated,

00:06:27.167 --> 00:06:33.100
all these barriers of ego and superego will disappear.

00:06:33.133 --> 00:06:39.100
But, as it is, also it's very easy to get rid of these two.

00:06:39.133 --> 00:06:41.834
It's very easy to get rid of these two.

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:44.267
Only by raising your Kundalini

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.067
and breaking your Brahmarandra.

00:06:48.133 --> 00:06:50.968
This is the greatest achievement that you have got,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.901
that you can break your Brahmarandra,

00:06:53.934 --> 00:06:56.434
make your Kundalini get connected

00:06:56.501 --> 00:06:57.968
with the All-pervading Power.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.267
That's why I always say you must meditate

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.234
and you must be in thoughtless awareness,

00:07:02.267 --> 00:07:03.667
then it works out.

00:07:08.801 --> 00:07:11.901
Like, from the river Ganges,

00:07:11.968 --> 00:07:13.634
if you have to fetch the water,

00:07:13.667 --> 00:07:15.801
you must have proper pitchers

00:07:15.834 --> 00:07:18.601
which are deep enough to receive the water.

00:07:18.634 --> 00:07:21.968
But if you take a stone, what can you bring out of it?

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.300
But the Ganges flows. It is what it is.

00:07:25.334 --> 00:07:28.167
It has its own capacities in it.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.601
It doesn't change because you people have taken stones.

00:07:32.634 --> 00:07:34.767
So now you have to understand

00:07:34.801 --> 00:07:38.200
that raise your Kundalini as many times as you can.

00:07:38.234 --> 00:07:41.534
Try to put attention to your Kundalini all the time.

00:07:41.567 --> 00:07:45.534
See where is the problem is. Get it cleared out, absolutely cleared out.

00:07:45.567 --> 00:07:47.434
Find out where is the problem is

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:49.167
and raise your Kundalini

00:07:49.234 --> 00:07:53.534
many a times and see that you are flowing all right

00:07:53.567 --> 00:07:55.667
on your fontanel bone area,

00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:58.267
so that your heart expands.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.734
It's a mechanical process in a way, you can say.

00:08:01.801 --> 00:08:04.100
But even that you people don't do.

00:08:04.167 --> 00:08:06.767
If you had done that, your heart would have increased.

00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:12.868
And you yourself will say, 'Mother, my heart has become large like Asia.'

00:08:12.901 --> 00:08:15.200
And then you see the miracle of the heart,

00:08:15.234 --> 00:08:19.267
how it emits vibrations by which

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.501
you become such compassionate,

00:08:22.534 --> 00:08:26.934
such dynamic, beautiful people and so sincere to Sahaja Yog.

00:08:28.033 --> 00:08:31.968
I would request you to open your heart today for this puja.

00:08:32.033 --> 00:08:34.167
You have been very jubilant and happy.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.567
And must be your heart must have opened

00:08:36.601 --> 00:08:39.734
because I've seen that Sahaja Yogis have a very large heart for Me,

00:08:39.801 --> 00:08:43.167
but for themselves they don't have.

00:08:43.234 --> 00:08:45.167
They'll do everything for Me,

00:08:45.267 --> 00:08:48.100
but nothing for themselves.

00:08:48.167 --> 00:08:52.434
They'll work morning till evening to decorate the hall, to do everything.

00:08:52.467 --> 00:08:55.834
They must have sent all these flowers to Me from I don't know where.

00:08:55.868 --> 00:09:00.934
But if I tell them 'You meditate for yourself', that they will not do.

00:09:01.567 --> 00:09:05.267
Or 'You achieve this for yourself', that they will not do.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.634
This is the situation.

00:09:08.667 --> 00:09:13.567
So, instead of wasting all your energy for decorating all these things,

00:09:13.601 --> 00:09:16.434
you should decorate yourself within yourself.

00:09:16.467 --> 00:09:19.901
With sincerity, with nice thoughts about yourself

00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:24.067
that you are capable, absolutely capable people

00:09:24.133 --> 00:09:29.701
and you can use your imagination,

00:09:29.734 --> 00:09:32.234
your intelligence, rationality,

00:09:32.267 --> 00:09:34.868
whatever you think you have,

00:09:34.901 --> 00:09:39.434
to find the way, to find the way, again I say,

00:09:39.467 --> 00:09:43.601
to keep your heart large.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:50.200
And this is the message for today's birthday all over the world

00:09:50.234 --> 00:09:53.767
because I felt that the whole world

00:09:53.801 --> 00:09:57.534
was today like a big heart pulsating.

00:09:57.567 --> 00:10:01.501
I received the last phone and came here.

00:10:06.434 --> 00:10:11.334
From all over the phones coming, flowers are showering,

00:10:11.367 --> 00:10:14.667
the beautiful nice things they are saying. Everything is there.

00:10:14.734 --> 00:10:18.667
When I am just drenched into it,

00:10:18.701 --> 00:10:21.033
just drenched, it was too much for Me.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.434
Such sweet, sweet things

00:10:23.467 --> 00:10:26.334
from the children, such things from the ladies,

00:10:26.367 --> 00:10:29.601
some very, very nice from the men

00:10:29.634 --> 00:10:32.734
and it was amazing how these people

00:10:32.767 --> 00:10:37.834
are bubbling with enjoyment that today is My birthday.

00:10:39.133 --> 00:10:40.367
In the same way,

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:45.501
please consider that every day is your birthday,

00:10:45.534 --> 00:10:48.767
that you have to raise your Kundalini all the time

00:10:48.801 --> 00:10:53.334
and keep the standard of your Kundalini higher and higher.

00:10:53.367 --> 00:10:55.067
The more you open out,

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.834
the more threads of Kundalini will come up

00:10:57.868 --> 00:11:02.601
and the more your heart will open out

00:11:02.634 --> 00:11:06.267
and it will be awakened, it will become more powerful.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.734
And with an open, big heart and a powerful heart,

00:11:09.767 --> 00:11:11.400
you can dominate your brain,

00:11:11.434 --> 00:11:15.167
which is giving you all these funny ideas.

00:11:15.234 --> 00:11:18.701
I hope this will happen this year

00:11:18.767 --> 00:11:23.300
here and people will try to make it a point

00:11:23.334 --> 00:11:26.234
that we have a large heart.

00:11:26.267 --> 00:11:28.601
Large heart doesn't mean stupidity,

00:11:28.667 --> 00:11:30.000
doesn't mean that.

00:11:30.067 --> 00:11:36.968
Large heart means the heart in which you can put Me in.

00:11:38.734 --> 00:11:42.534
It's quite a big person, Myself,

00:11:42.567 --> 00:11:44.834
so you have to have a very large heart

00:11:44.868 --> 00:11:47.300
that I could reside into your heart.

00:11:47.334 --> 00:11:49.367
That is the large heart

00:11:49.434 --> 00:11:51.701
and that's what you all should have.

00:11:51.734 --> 00:11:56.234
If that happens, then everything will work out very well.

00:11:56.267 --> 00:11:58.834
So, the surrendering part of it:

00:11:58.868 --> 00:12:01.567
you must know how to surrender

00:12:01.601 --> 00:12:05.501
and you must know how to keep whatever is not surrendered,

00:12:05.567 --> 00:12:09.601
because you surrender yourself

00:12:10.033 --> 00:12:16.767
in such a manner that you expand your heart absolutely.

00:12:16.801 --> 00:12:18.434
Put Me down there

00:12:18.467 --> 00:12:21.567
and then keep your flowers

00:12:21.601 --> 00:12:25.200
with you to be given to Me at a time

00:12:25.267 --> 00:12:32.534
when you are in complete control of yourself.

00:12:32.567 --> 00:12:34.667
So you have your emotions,

00:12:34.701 --> 00:12:38.167
your feelings like flowers,

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.133
that you have to keep to yourself,

00:12:40.167 --> 00:12:44.667
which are the part of the same ocean of your heart.

00:12:44.701 --> 00:12:48.701
And, once you are ready,

00:12:48.767 --> 00:12:51.133
everything is done,

00:12:51.167 --> 00:12:53.567
if the whole house is ready,

00:12:53.601 --> 00:12:56.868
now bring the flowers, the emotions,

00:12:56.901 --> 00:13:01.400
the nice things, the beautiful things and nourish them.

00:13:01.434 --> 00:13:03.033
One must learn, I think,

00:13:03.067 --> 00:13:06.234
there should be some books about

00:13:06.267 --> 00:13:09.334
how to say nice things to others.

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.467
We should try to find some books like that

00:13:12.501 --> 00:13:16.534
or should write some books how nice things could be said,

00:13:16.567 --> 00:13:18.901
how we can take care of others,

00:13:18.934 --> 00:13:24.968
how we can make another feel our love,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.834
the expression of love,

00:13:26.868 --> 00:13:30.934
and that work, such a book will really help people to understand

00:13:30.968 --> 00:13:32.934
that this is nice to say.

00:13:32.968 --> 00:13:35.868
And once you say something nice to other,

00:13:35.901 --> 00:13:40.767
that niceness comes back, as I have told you,

00:13:40.834 --> 00:13:43.767
like the ripples that touch the shores come back

00:13:43.834 --> 00:13:46.634
and then you feel very happy.

00:13:46.667 --> 00:13:50.901
Go on saying things which are nice,

00:13:50.934 --> 00:13:53.634
which are pleasing,

00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:55.634
will be very much appreciated.

00:13:55.667 --> 00:13:59.667
But if you say it with sincerity, not just to tease someone

00:13:59.734 --> 00:14:01.067
or to say something,

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:04.000
just to be so superficially good,

00:14:04.067 --> 00:14:06.067
like 'Thank you, thank you, thank you,'

00:14:06.167 --> 00:14:09.601
but something from your heart, as they say,

00:14:09.634 --> 00:14:11.667
then you will be surprised

00:14:11.701 --> 00:14:15.133
that the heart of the another person will open

00:14:15.167 --> 00:14:17.467
and from that heart will flow

00:14:17.501 --> 00:14:21.701
those beautiful flowers of emotions towards you.

00:14:21.734 --> 00:14:25.300
So, on one side, you have to expand your heart

00:14:25.334 --> 00:14:30.067
and on another side, you have to reserve or preserve

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:34.100
all the beautiful, nice, delicate feelings within yourself,

00:14:34.133 --> 00:14:36.033
absorbed from everywhere

00:14:36.067 --> 00:14:38.734
and then to pour them out at the right point.

00:14:38.767 --> 00:14:40.968
That's the art.

00:14:42.434 --> 00:14:45.667
Like these flowers were in the garden first to begin with,

00:14:45.701 --> 00:14:47.000
preserved, preserved.

00:14:47.067 --> 00:14:49.167
At the right time they were brought in.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.300
So they feel more glorified

00:14:51.334 --> 00:14:53.767
that they are used at the right time.

00:14:53.834 --> 00:14:58.100
This is the way we have to be with ourselves in our heart

00:14:58.133 --> 00:15:01.934
because human beings are very delicate,

00:15:02.534 --> 00:15:05.033
very beautiful things

00:15:05.067 --> 00:15:08.968
and to beautify them you have to say beautiful things.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.234
This tongue is not for saying harsh things,

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.400
for making fun of others,

00:15:14.434 --> 00:15:17.868
for teasing others, but is for saying something,

00:15:17.901 --> 00:15:19.968
such a beautiful thing

00:15:20.033 --> 00:15:25.100
that the another person also imbibes that beauty.

00:15:26.434 --> 00:15:29.267
I've seen some nice things people have said

00:15:29.334 --> 00:15:32.667
and that lingers in My mind. And I said,

00:15:32.734 --> 00:15:36.601
'When will I have chance to say these things to others?'

00:15:36.634 --> 00:15:40.534
So, think about it, that 'Now this is a very nice sentence',

00:15:40.567 --> 00:15:43.701
'This was a very sweet thing they said.

00:15:43.734 --> 00:15:47.100
All right. So now, where should I use this?'

00:15:47.133 --> 00:15:49.100
As I go to the shops,

00:15:49.133 --> 00:15:50.801
I see something: 'Ah, that's good.

00:15:50.834 --> 00:15:54.133
That will be good for particular person. Let's buy that.'

00:15:54.167 --> 00:15:55.534
In the same way,

00:15:55.567 --> 00:15:58.400
if you find these nice feelings

00:15:58.467 --> 00:16:02.400
and nice emotions and nice things said,

00:16:02.467 --> 00:16:04.300
then what do you do?

00:16:04.334 --> 00:16:06.367
You collect them, all these things,

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:10.300
keep them and use them at the right time,

00:16:10.334 --> 00:16:11.634
at the right place.

00:16:11.667 --> 00:16:16.033
This is what is the wisdom of Shri Ganesha.

00:16:16.667 --> 00:16:20.868
Innocent people are the most sincere people,

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.801
innocent people.

00:16:22.834 --> 00:16:24.767
Those who are clever and cunning

00:16:24.801 --> 00:16:29.033
cannot be sincere because they enjoy their cunningness,

00:16:29.067 --> 00:16:33.167
they enjoy their so-called 'brilliance'.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.968
They can never be.

00:16:35.033 --> 00:16:41.667
Those people who are simple,

00:16:41.701 --> 00:16:43.934
who are loving,

00:16:43.968 --> 00:16:48.601
who care for love more than anything else,

00:16:48.634 --> 00:16:56.133
can only say very nice things sincerely.

00:16:56.167 --> 00:17:01.367
Today I wanted to say many things to you,

00:17:02.167 --> 00:17:11.200
how I feel about this birthday in Australia,

00:17:11.634 --> 00:17:14.534
but I told you the words fail.

00:17:14.601 --> 00:17:17.901
Because - see, Australia is such a far-off country.

00:17:17.934 --> 00:17:21.367
To come here with so many people sitting

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.868
and singing 'Agata Swagata'.

00:17:24.901 --> 00:17:28.901
It is unbelievable, unbelievable,

00:17:29.067 --> 00:17:31.300
because I have not given you any money,

00:17:31.334 --> 00:17:33.100
you have not given Me any money,

00:17:33.133 --> 00:17:36.934
you are not bound to say anything like that.

00:17:38.133 --> 00:17:40.300
But not only that you are doing it,

00:17:40.334 --> 00:17:43.834
but you are enjoying it.

00:17:44.167 --> 00:17:48.100
It's something great. You're enjoying it and that's what it is:

00:17:48.133 --> 00:17:50.367
that when your heart is large,

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.300
then whatever you do for others, you enjoy.

00:17:53.334 --> 00:17:55.267
You enjoy doing good things.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.234
You enjoy saying nice things.

00:17:57.267 --> 00:18:02.133
So we should have choicest flowers of beautiful sayings,

00:18:02.167 --> 00:18:06.467
we should have choicest emotions

00:18:06.501 --> 00:18:09.267
which we should be able to express to each other.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.667
Now start on that from today,

00:18:11.734 --> 00:18:13.901
I have to say: you start on this,

00:18:13.934 --> 00:18:18.968
that from 1990 we are all the time going to speak something

00:18:19.033 --> 00:18:22.033
beautiful to each other all the time

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.534
and just keep your ears open,

00:18:24.567 --> 00:18:28.234
keep your eyes open and wherever you get a chance,

00:18:28.267 --> 00:18:30.567
wherever you hear something like that,

00:18:30.601 --> 00:18:34.267
keep it in your mind and use it back.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:38.000
Today I am so enamored

00:18:38.033 --> 00:18:40.667
and it is too much for Me, really,

00:18:40.701 --> 00:18:42.968
to believe even that

00:18:43.033 --> 00:18:46.801
there are so many Sahaja Yogis in Australia,

00:18:46.834 --> 00:18:48.834
which is so far away.

00:18:48.868 --> 00:18:50.434
So try to develop your sincerity

00:18:50.467 --> 00:18:54.100
Raise your Kundalini as many times as you can.

00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:57.534
Keep it there. Keep it on Sahasrara

00:18:57.601 --> 00:19:01.734
and see that your heart opens. That's the best way.

00:19:01.801 --> 00:19:04.501
They've been all asking Me 'How to open our heart?'

00:19:04.567 --> 00:19:08.501
I said, 'Take the key.' Now, I don't know how to tell them.

00:19:08.601 --> 00:19:12.701
'Open your heart' means just raise your Kundalini,

00:19:12.734 --> 00:19:17.367
keep to the Brahmarandra and see that the Brahmarandra opens.
