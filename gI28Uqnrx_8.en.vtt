Shri Virata Viratangana Puja. Los Angeles (USA), 10 October 1993

00:00:49.525 --> 00:00:56.165
Today, we are going to celebrate

00:00:56.285 --> 00:01:01.085
the puja of Virata and Viratangana.

00:01:09.885 --> 00:01:13.365
North America and South America,

00:01:13.485 --> 00:01:25.405
as you know is the Shri Krishna’s center of Vishuddhi.

00:01:27.845 --> 00:01:33.845
And it is very important to know also

00:01:33.965 --> 00:01:37.805
that all the communications,

00:01:37.925 --> 00:01:43.085
all the relationships with the whole creation

00:01:43.205 --> 00:01:48.525
has to be established through this center of Vishuddhi.

00:01:48.645 --> 00:01:54.365
Vishuddhi, as you know is the most important center

00:01:54.485 --> 00:01:57.285
in your ascent, in a way.

00:01:59.165 --> 00:02:05.405
Because Sahaja Yoga is not only meant for your ascent

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:08.925
but for the ascent of the whole world,

00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:14.205
and only through Vishuddhi you can achieve it.

00:02:14.325 --> 00:02:17.605
Even if you get your self-realization

00:02:17.725 --> 00:02:27.165
and you get all the powers,

00:02:27.285 --> 00:02:32.445
unless and until you use your Vishuddhi, it won’t work out.

00:02:32.565 --> 00:02:34.085
Look at my Vishuddhi also,

00:02:34.205 --> 00:02:38.365
talking, talking everywhere, keeping communications,

00:02:38.485 --> 00:02:40.765
Vishuddhi goes out!

00:02:44.525 --> 00:02:51.205
Also, this Vishuddhi chakra being so important,

00:02:51.325 --> 00:02:55.205
it is under attack.

00:02:55.325 --> 00:03:00.285
Attack of the negative force.

00:03:05.725 --> 00:03:11.885
Today we are going to worship Virata and Viratangana.

00:03:12.645 --> 00:03:16.325
Virat is the ultimate,

00:03:16.445 --> 00:03:21.325
the complete development of the Vishuddhi chakra is Virata.

00:03:21.445 --> 00:03:25.045
And as you know the chakra is here

00:03:26.085 --> 00:03:28.245
here at this point.

00:03:29.205 --> 00:03:34.765
If this chakra is not alright, you are not collective.

00:03:34.885 --> 00:03:39.205
You behave in a manner that is not collective.

00:03:39.325 --> 00:03:46.325
You cannot communicate with other Sahaja yogis.

00:03:46.445 --> 00:03:54.885
You cannot be friendly, loving and one with other Sahaja yogis

00:03:55.845 --> 00:04:01.485
unless and until this center here,
Vishuddhi is alright.

00:04:01.605 --> 00:04:04.765
And it is part of Ekadesha.

00:04:04.885 --> 00:04:09.645
Vishuddhi is the center of the Ekadesha Rudra.

00:04:14.285 --> 00:04:25.125
So one has to understand that Virata Shakti is spread all over.

00:04:26.845 --> 00:04:29.685
We have communications.

00:04:29.805 --> 00:04:32.645
Mean I could telephone from here to anyone

00:04:32.765 --> 00:04:35.205
and they told me they don’t charge much.

00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:38.885
You see is something also from Shri Krishna’s blessing, I think.

00:04:39.005 --> 00:04:43.285
Because you telephone from anywhere else it is very difficult,

00:04:43.405 --> 00:04:45.925
and very expensive.

00:04:46.045 --> 00:04:52.645
Also, most of the communications vehicles

00:04:52.765 --> 00:05:00.245
like computer, like television, other things also,

00:05:00.365 --> 00:05:05.325
all those so many of them were developed in this country.

00:05:07.525 --> 00:05:12.085
So it is the subtle of that Ether

00:05:13.365 --> 00:05:18.805
which communicates us to other worlds.

00:05:20.285 --> 00:05:24.885
That is one power of Virata.

00:05:25.005 --> 00:05:28.445
That he is the subtle of that.

00:05:33.405 --> 00:05:36.725
The second power which we have

00:05:36.845 --> 00:05:42.045
of Viratangana we can say because Virat is

00:05:42.165 --> 00:05:48.085
the kinetic force of but the source is Viratangana,

00:05:49.925 --> 00:05:59.125
is everything that brain can do.

00:06:01.405 --> 00:06:15.325
All thinking, all creativity, all compassion,

00:06:19.525 --> 00:06:27.565
all kinds of looking after other nations.

00:06:27.685 --> 00:06:29.765
The other day somebody asked,

00:06:29.885 --> 00:06:32.565
“Why should we be policemen of the whole world?”

00:06:32.685 --> 00:06:35.245
You jolly well have to be,

00:06:36.245 --> 00:06:39.805
because, you are Viratas.

00:06:39.925 --> 00:06:45.165
So you have to look after the law and order of the whole world.

00:06:45.285 --> 00:06:47.365
You have to look after

00:06:47.485 --> 00:06:52.405
all the people who are suffering in this world.

00:06:52.525 --> 00:06:56.445
You have to look after all the suppressions

00:06:56.565 --> 00:07:02.205
and the wars and the civil wars everywhere,

00:07:02.325 --> 00:07:05.005
is all your headache,

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:10.685
because you are sitting in the land of Virat.

00:07:11.685 --> 00:07:15.885
So He’s the Father.

00:07:16.925 --> 00:07:22.205
He’s what you call Jehovah.

00:07:22.325 --> 00:07:24.605
He’s Akhbar.

00:07:28.845 --> 00:07:32.805
So on the brain level

00:07:33.765 --> 00:07:40.405
when Kundalini reaches and enlightens your brain

00:07:40.525 --> 00:07:45.005
then this science that you know

00:07:46.285 --> 00:07:55.365
becomes logical not only that but you know meta science

00:07:56.565 --> 00:08:02.045
because the brain which was just knowing science

00:08:02.165 --> 00:08:05.285
now knows the source of science.

00:08:06.325 --> 00:08:10.925
The whole thing it can see, clearly.

00:08:12.765 --> 00:08:17.685
Like you climb up a hill or a mountain,

00:08:18.045 --> 00:08:25.885
the higher you go you can see the whole vision of the place.

00:08:26.245 --> 00:08:32.805
In the same way whatever is created out of your brain, anything,

00:08:34.805 --> 00:08:39.045
you start getting the whole vision of it what they have created.

00:08:39.165 --> 00:08:44.325
Not only that but you also see what has created that.

00:08:45.125 --> 00:08:47.205
Now they created United Nations.

00:08:47.325 --> 00:08:49.285
It had to be here, Why?

00:08:49.405 --> 00:08:51.885
Why in America?

00:08:52.685 --> 00:08:59.725
Why is America so much worried about United nations?

00:09:00.645 --> 00:09:05.925
What is its responsibility?

00:09:06.325 --> 00:09:07.885
No country will do that.

00:09:08.005 --> 00:09:09.845
It’s a headache.

00:09:10.565 --> 00:09:12.165
But they’ll go to Vietnam,

00:09:12.285 --> 00:09:14.085
they’ll go to Korea.

00:09:14.205 --> 00:09:15.936
Now they are busy with Bosnia.

00:09:16.057 --> 00:09:19.297
Everywhere, Somalia.

00:09:20.405 --> 00:09:23.565
It’s your responsibility

00:09:23.685 --> 00:09:28.365
because all these things are created by your brain.

00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:32.565
The human brain has created different nations.

00:09:33.725 --> 00:09:38.805
So above all we realize that all these nations

00:09:38.925 --> 00:09:41.085
belong to one world.

00:09:41.845 --> 00:09:46.485
Once you rise above you see that this was created by us,

00:09:46.605 --> 00:09:51.965
by our own thinking, by our own projections we have created.

00:09:54.325 --> 00:10:04.085
So when you go above this you start thinking of one world,

00:10:04.205 --> 00:10:07.765
because you see that it was one world.

00:10:07.885 --> 00:10:09.765
It is one world.

00:10:11.085 --> 00:10:16.885
You start seeing God has created beautiful rivers

00:10:17.565 --> 00:10:24.045
and beautiful mountains, He never divided.

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:27.805
I mean He wanted to create beauty for you.

00:10:27.925 --> 00:10:29.605
But then we started thinking

00:10:29.725 --> 00:10:33.885
“This is my land, that is my land.”

00:10:34.005 --> 00:10:37.965
Most of the Americans have come from outside,

00:10:38.085 --> 00:10:40.765
and the real land owners I don’t know where are they hiding.

00:10:40.885 --> 00:10:42.685
I seldom see them.

00:10:44.725 --> 00:10:48.405
Now the responsibility is coming in their heads

00:10:48.525 --> 00:10:51.965
that we have taken this land

00:10:53.005 --> 00:11:00.125
and we feel that this is our land

00:11:00.245 --> 00:11:03.645
but it belongs to the whole world.

00:11:03.765 --> 00:11:07.565
Whatever they have done now is coming back.

00:11:07.685 --> 00:11:10.565
Once you rise higher you start seeing the vision.

00:11:10.685 --> 00:11:15.485
Whatever you have done through your mental projections.

00:11:15.605 --> 00:11:19.245
People don’t even realize in many countries

00:11:19.365 --> 00:11:22.085
that this is one world.

00:11:24.325 --> 00:11:30.925
Mental projection is on another level

00:11:31.045 --> 00:11:37.365
is that you have created a materialistic world.

00:11:37.485 --> 00:11:41.485
With this materialistic world

00:11:41.605 --> 00:11:47.165
you have reduced everything to the level of money.

00:11:47.285 --> 00:11:51.885
Religion is money, everything is money.

00:11:52.885 --> 00:11:58.205
Nobody has any respect for anything but for money.

00:12:00.245 --> 00:12:05.685
And then material things.

00:12:06.085 --> 00:12:13.645
One starts seeing matter as a source of wealth

00:12:14.125 --> 00:12:17.685
and source of dignity

00:12:18.685 --> 00:12:26.525
and a source of great positions, powers.

00:12:29.645 --> 00:12:36.365
But when you rise higher into Virata’s power

00:12:36.925 --> 00:12:40.805
you see the stupidity of materialism.

00:12:42.885 --> 00:12:45.885
What is matter after all?

00:12:47.525 --> 00:12:53.605
Matter is for making the place beautiful,

00:12:54.845 --> 00:12:57.405
giving you joy,

00:12:59.325 --> 00:13:07.525
and this matter is also for expression of your joy to others.

00:13:07.645 --> 00:13:10.165
When you give them some present,

00:13:10.285 --> 00:13:13.965
some material thing beautifully made.

00:13:14.085 --> 00:13:16.685
Then you start thinking also

00:13:16.805 --> 00:13:22.525
how God has created this beautiful world

00:13:22.645 --> 00:13:31.085
and you start creating beautiful things

00:13:31.205 --> 00:13:41.245
in art, in music, drama, even films, everything.

00:13:43.245 --> 00:13:49.965
But at the material level and at the mental level

00:13:50.085 --> 00:13:53.845
the projection is linear; it moves like this.

00:13:53.965 --> 00:13:56.845
As a result, it falls down.

00:13:57.325 --> 00:14:03.405
So everything, the standard of our expression has fallen down.

00:14:03.525 --> 00:14:08.685
I know films in the twenties and thirties and forties

00:14:08.805 --> 00:14:10.605
from the same Hollywood

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:13.725
were very different from what they are today.

00:14:13.845 --> 00:14:16.965
You can’t even see some of them.

00:14:19.885 --> 00:14:22.085
Then in the same mental projection

00:14:22.205 --> 00:14:27.445
we see the dramas and the novels and the art,

00:14:27.605 --> 00:14:32.485
everything has come down, is deteriorated,

00:14:32.605 --> 00:14:39.605
is not at all joy giving but it is destructive.

00:14:39.725 --> 00:14:43.325
It is destroying itself, first of all,

00:14:43.445 --> 00:14:45.845
and so it is destructive.

00:14:45.965 --> 00:14:49.885
As a result, we are moving our mind

00:14:50.005 --> 00:14:53.045
and moving on that decline also

00:14:53.165 --> 00:14:57.925
and we also take to things which are destructive.

00:14:58.045 --> 00:15:02.365
Our standards in everything have gone down.

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:06.045
Morality also is an innate blessing to human beings

00:15:06.165 --> 00:15:12.925
but he starts putting it on a mental level.

00:15:15.365 --> 00:15:17.765
When you put it on the mental level

00:15:17.885 --> 00:15:21.725
people like Freud become Christ,

00:15:21.845 --> 00:15:24.085
and you start following them

00:15:24.205 --> 00:15:28.845
and you become nothing but a sex point.

00:15:29.085 --> 00:15:36.325
In every direction if you see there’s a big decline

00:15:38.885 --> 00:15:42.285
and you get upset, you don’t understand,

00:15:42.405 --> 00:15:45.885
how there is such a decline in human nature,

00:15:46.005 --> 00:15:50.205
how there is a decline in art, decline under treasure,

00:15:50.325 --> 00:15:52.605
decline on human relationships,

00:15:52.725 --> 00:15:56.725
in everywhere you find this decline.

00:15:58.045 --> 00:16:00.485
With money of course, certain things

00:16:00.605 --> 00:16:05.045
may appear to be smart, fast, like tennis you can say.

00:16:05.165 --> 00:16:10.005
People used to play tennis for joy, never for money.

00:16:10.125 --> 00:16:12.805
But now they play for money and

00:16:12.925 --> 00:16:16.725
after four, five days we find he has gone down,

00:16:16.845 --> 00:16:20.405
or four, five years he is finished.

00:16:22.405 --> 00:16:30.045
So the speed has come also into sports because of money.

00:16:30.165 --> 00:16:33.925
This money has been like a big load

00:16:34.045 --> 00:16:44.045
has brought down all the beautiful things in its own level.

00:16:44.165 --> 00:16:48.725
They are not the same level at which they are created.

00:16:48.845 --> 00:16:50.925
If it was on the same level,

00:16:51.045 --> 00:16:55.245
Sahaja Yoga would have worked very nicely in America.

00:16:55.365 --> 00:17:01.365
But it did not, because here is the maximum load

00:17:02.045 --> 00:17:08.925
on all our creations of our mind of our mental projections.

00:17:09.045 --> 00:17:11.285
Whatever direction you will see

00:17:11.405 --> 00:17:15.885
you will find there is such a decline.

00:17:16.005 --> 00:17:21.325
We know of lawyers who would be so honest

00:17:21.445 --> 00:17:26.205
and who would work out something

00:17:26.325 --> 00:17:29.085
for the person for whom they are fighting.

00:17:29.205 --> 00:17:32.085
But today you can bribe the lawyers.

00:17:32.205 --> 00:17:40.845
We know the doctors which would go all out to cure patients,

00:17:41.285 --> 00:17:45.845
they have lost their sense of ethics.

00:17:45.965 --> 00:17:49.565
Everybody has lost the sense of ethics.

00:17:49.685 --> 00:17:58.765
First is this materialism, money and above all I think

00:17:59.885 --> 00:18:05.445
at this time there is a big growth of people

00:18:05.565 --> 00:18:09.245
because this is a resurrection time.

00:18:09.365 --> 00:18:12.685
And many types of people are born.

00:18:12.805 --> 00:18:16.205
Thousands and thousands of them are born

00:18:16.325 --> 00:18:19.645
who might be like animals or maybe

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:26.285
some sort of absolutely idiotic type

00:18:26.405 --> 00:18:30.085
or maybe some stupid stuff.

00:18:31.365 --> 00:18:34.245
At this time, we have to do resurrection work,

00:18:34.365 --> 00:18:37.365
means what, that our Virata Shakti

00:18:37.485 --> 00:18:42.405
has to be enlightened in our brain.

00:18:55.285 --> 00:19:00.845
So in Sahaja Yoga when you rise into Virata Shakti

00:19:00.965 --> 00:19:07.685
you go up and see all these declines,

00:19:07.805 --> 00:19:14.605
all these falling mental projections, from that height.

00:19:14.725 --> 00:19:17.885
And also you see yourself.

00:19:18.005 --> 00:19:24.205
That you had gone into all these nonsensical things,

00:19:24.325 --> 00:19:27.485
but now you feel that you have come out of it

00:19:27.605 --> 00:19:31.565
and now you have become like a lotus.

00:19:31.685 --> 00:19:34.485
Especially the ego part.

00:19:34.605 --> 00:19:41.205
Ego is extremely strong in modern times. It was never so.

00:19:43.085 --> 00:19:52.325
It is, I think the birth of many fighting cocks

00:19:52.445 --> 00:19:57.605
has come on this earth and also

00:19:57.725 --> 00:20:03.085
some of the jungle creatures are also reborn.

00:20:03.205 --> 00:20:05.085
Because you can’t talk to them.

00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:07.645
If you say anything they just jump on you.

00:20:07.765 --> 00:20:09.405
You cannot criticize them,

00:20:09.525 --> 00:20:11.525
you cannot tell them what’s wrong with you,

00:20:11.645 --> 00:20:13.045
they’ll just sit on your head,

00:20:13.165 --> 00:20:15.485
if you say anything they’ll start hitting you.

00:20:15.605 --> 00:20:19.405
They never want to see what’s wrong with them.

00:20:19.525 --> 00:20:24.925
It’s impossible to communicate to them because of their ego

00:20:25.045 --> 00:20:31.285
and this ego has come because of certain

00:20:31.405 --> 00:20:35.245
declining nature of the modern time.

00:20:36.765 --> 00:20:40.965
For example, from childhood

00:20:41.085 --> 00:20:47.685
a mother starts scolding her child for spoiling her carpet.

00:20:47.805 --> 00:20:51.285
So carpet becomes more important.

00:20:51.405 --> 00:20:54.045
So the next day the child gets very angry,

00:20:54.165 --> 00:20:58.085
he gets the scissors and cuts the carpet

00:20:58.205 --> 00:21:00.125
to punish the mother.

00:21:02.245 --> 00:21:09.565
Then they see that the child wants money for something

00:21:11.005 --> 00:21:12.405
and they ask him for what.

00:21:12.525 --> 00:21:15.445
“Because I have seen in the television that

00:21:15.565 --> 00:21:19.565
there is a bear which has a birth date.”

00:21:19.685 --> 00:21:24.565
So a new type of devils have come up they are entrepreneurs

00:21:24.685 --> 00:21:27.405
and through their mental projections

00:21:27.525 --> 00:21:30.565
they take out novel ideas,

00:21:30.685 --> 00:21:34.325
see like a teddy bear which has a birth date,

00:21:34.445 --> 00:21:37.925
can you imagine, such a stupid idea.

00:21:38.045 --> 00:21:41.445
And all the children wanting to buy that.

00:21:41.565 --> 00:21:45.925
Now if one child buys another must have it.

00:21:46.045 --> 00:21:49.005
All kinds of things these entrepreneurs do.

00:21:49.125 --> 00:21:52.965
And people start becoming slaves of them.

00:21:53.085 --> 00:21:57.965
Like in Paris they started a fashion

00:21:58.085 --> 00:22:02.205
that you’ll have six inches of skirts.

00:22:02.325 --> 00:22:04.565
So all other skirts were thrown away.

00:22:04.685 --> 00:22:06.965
The six inches skirts started.

00:22:07.085 --> 00:22:10.525
Imagine in that cold, they would wear socks

00:22:10.645 --> 00:22:14.725
and six inches of skirts. Everybody looks the same.

00:22:14.845 --> 00:22:17.325
What is so beautiful about it.

00:22:17.445 --> 00:22:21.725
Whatever they want the entrepreneurs so called,

00:22:22.445 --> 00:22:28.645
they are called as artists, also as designers,

00:22:28.765 --> 00:22:34.205
but their designs are just to kill your freedom,

00:22:34.325 --> 00:22:37.725
just to make you a slave.

00:22:37.845 --> 00:22:43.445
And all kinds of monkey tricks they play, which you accept.

00:22:43.565 --> 00:22:47.325
Once you start accepting those monkey tricks,

00:22:47.445 --> 00:22:55.325
then you don’t also realize that how you have become a slave

00:22:56.805 --> 00:22:59.685
and there is no individuality about it.

00:22:59.805 --> 00:23:05.845
Hairstyle they will start particular hair style.

00:23:05.965 --> 00:23:09.685
So everybody goes about with the same hairstyle.

00:23:09.805 --> 00:23:12.805
Or you go to a hairdresser.

00:24:21.845 --> 00:24:28.925
So when you rise into your Virata Shakti

00:24:29.165 --> 00:24:32.725
by the enlightenment of the Kundalini,

00:24:33.565 --> 00:24:40.205
the Viratangana is the power which gives you

00:24:40.605 --> 00:24:47.605
a complete vision of the decline

00:24:47.725 --> 00:24:53.965
into which every mental projection

00:24:54.085 --> 00:25:01.805
which was idealistic, beautiful has fallen.

00:25:02.965 --> 00:25:10.965
For example, Abraham Lincoln gave a very great idealistic idea

00:25:11.525 --> 00:25:17.165
about the a state, about democracy.

00:25:17.285 --> 00:25:22.165
But now many people say that it is demonocracy.

00:25:22.885 --> 00:25:26.965
Those people who were in Russia, of course they were wrong,

00:25:27.085 --> 00:25:30.045
but still they had an argument

00:25:30.165 --> 00:25:33.485
that we don’t want to become democratic

00:25:33.605 --> 00:25:39.405
because look at America.

00:25:39.525 --> 00:25:44.885
Nothing is safe, nothing is normal,

00:25:46.685 --> 00:25:49.605
so what’s the use of becoming democratic country.

00:25:49.725 --> 00:25:55.965
Can you hear me there, it's all right! it's all right.

00:26:00.965 --> 00:26:04.885
After all we are on a picnic, you see.

00:26:09.805 --> 00:26:12.845
And we cannot have any problems

00:26:12.965 --> 00:26:17.605
because I told him whatever is here is here,

00:26:17.725 --> 00:26:20.645
and whatever is not, is not here.

00:26:20.765 --> 00:26:24.845
So if you have any problem, we can’t help it.

00:26:33.085 --> 00:26:37.525
So you rise to that level, gradually, gradually,

00:26:37.645 --> 00:26:41.165
first, I don’t know what you see.

00:26:42.765 --> 00:26:48.645
But you start seeing what’s wrong with your society,

00:26:48.765 --> 00:26:55.845
what’s wrong with your relationships.

00:26:55.965 --> 00:27:01.045
Ultimately, you start seeing what’s wrong with you,

00:27:02.165 --> 00:27:04.485
how you are wrong.

00:27:04.605 --> 00:27:09.285
That I would say is the higher state

00:27:09.405 --> 00:27:11.885
where you reach and you start seeing

00:27:12.005 --> 00:27:14.605
"This is wrong with me".

00:27:16.725 --> 00:27:25.125
After that you start understanding

00:27:27.285 --> 00:27:33.045
that you have got powers, Viratangana’s powers.

00:27:34.525 --> 00:27:38.005
You have got powers.

00:27:38.125 --> 00:27:42.645
In your brain itself, you have got powers.

00:27:51.805 --> 00:27:57.645
By which you understand the Meta Science,

00:27:57.765 --> 00:28:03.885
science above science, the meta art.

00:28:04.005 --> 00:28:10.085
The vulgarity of art. Discrimination starts working,

00:28:10.205 --> 00:28:15.445
you start understanding what is really art, what is not.

00:28:17.005 --> 00:28:20.525
You start enjoying that art.

00:28:21.885 --> 00:28:26.725
And the enjoyment of Nirananda,

00:28:27.405 --> 00:28:33.645
you get it when you rise above and see

00:28:33.765 --> 00:28:37.605
the whole thing in a different perspective.

00:28:38.405 --> 00:28:45.765
First of all, you see it as a drama, as a witness.

00:28:48.325 --> 00:28:50.605
And you laugh, you see.

00:28:52.125 --> 00:28:56.285
I was telling a joke about a lady who was interviewed

00:28:56.405 --> 00:29:01.085
for doing some art with the mehndi on the hand.

00:29:01.205 --> 00:29:04.085
She’s an Indian lady from India.

00:29:05.005 --> 00:29:06.845
So the interviewer asked her,

00:29:06.965 --> 00:29:12.285
“What about the foreigners, how do they react,

00:29:12.405 --> 00:29:14.805
the Americans, how do they react?

00:29:14.925 --> 00:29:19.645
She said that they ask very funny questions.

00:29:19.765 --> 00:29:23.605
Funny questions? Yes, they ask me, “What is this?”

00:29:23.725 --> 00:29:28.485
So I said, “This is my Suhaag,

00:29:28.605 --> 00:29:35.805
my husband’s symbol, that's what I wear.”

00:29:36.965 --> 00:29:41.005
So they said, what about extras?

00:29:41.125 --> 00:29:45.445
“You didn’t follow?”- What about the extra husbands if you have?

00:29:48.485 --> 00:29:52.685
Now you all are laughing at it, you all Americas are laughing,

00:29:52.805 --> 00:29:55.165
but at that time point you would not have laughed,

00:29:55.285 --> 00:29:57.365
because very common.

00:30:01.085 --> 00:30:04.525
In the same way, everyone,

00:30:04.645 --> 00:30:09.805
even India or any place where they do absurd things

00:30:09.925 --> 00:30:17.245
it becomes very obvious and you start seeing it very clearly,

00:30:18.205 --> 00:30:24.325
very very clearly that what are we doing, it’s all absurd.

00:30:26.845 --> 00:30:29.685
But this is not only on mental level.

00:30:29.805 --> 00:30:31.685
This is what I am going to tell you.

00:30:31.805 --> 00:30:35.005
It is not just you see the vision,

00:30:35.125 --> 00:30:37.805
all right, still mental level,

00:30:38.445 --> 00:30:42.725
then you understand it is wrong, still mental level.

00:30:42.845 --> 00:30:45.965
But you just don’t do it.

00:30:47.525 --> 00:30:53.045
You become part and parcel of Virata.

00:30:55.005 --> 00:31:00.725
When you become part and parcel of Virata then

00:31:03.437 --> 00:31:07.997
you don’t have to even think, you just see it, and you laugh.

00:31:08.125 --> 00:31:11.365
You just see and you know it is wrong.

00:31:12.325 --> 00:31:14.725
It is all absurdity.

00:31:19.885 --> 00:31:24.925
We went to see one temple in India

00:31:25.765 --> 00:31:30.525
and there were some pujaris, doing puja.

00:31:30.645 --> 00:31:34.085
So the Indian Sahaja Yogis ran out.

00:31:34.205 --> 00:31:35.845
I said, “What happened?”

00:31:35.965 --> 00:31:39.925
“Mother, they are all hypocrites, they have horrible vibrations,

00:31:40.045 --> 00:31:41.925
how can they do puja,

00:31:42.045 --> 00:31:44.965
they have horrible vibrations, all bhoots.

00:31:48.605 --> 00:31:55.125
That’s how we become so powerful,

00:31:57.085 --> 00:31:59.845
I would not say you are like a light,

00:31:59.965 --> 00:32:03.765
because light doesn’t see the light does it?

00:32:05.165 --> 00:32:11.245
But you see, you are light and you see light.

00:32:14.645 --> 00:32:20.845
And the third thing that happens to you with this Viratangana

00:32:20.965 --> 00:32:27.725
that you humble down. You humble down.

00:32:29.525 --> 00:32:35.005
You become extremely sweet, obedient,

00:32:35.125 --> 00:32:37.645
just like children.

00:32:39.205 --> 00:32:43.125
And you don’t mind anything, anything you don’t mind.

00:32:45.045 --> 00:32:53.365
That is the state you achieve not as a slave,

00:32:53.485 --> 00:33:01.965
not out of domination, but it just works in you,

00:33:03.605 --> 00:33:10.805
it penetrates into your brain, you become that.

00:33:11.405 --> 00:33:15.365
I’ve seen people who are horrid absolutely,

00:33:15.485 --> 00:33:19.405
and after some time you can’t even recognize them.

00:33:20.805 --> 00:33:23.365
How do they change?

00:33:24.685 --> 00:33:27.685
How do they get the change?

00:33:28.125 --> 00:33:30.845
What happens to them?

00:33:30.965 --> 00:33:37.005
Is the brain is enlightened, has become the light

00:33:37.125 --> 00:33:40.005
and you know you have the light.

00:33:40.125 --> 00:33:43.365
That is doubtless awareness.

00:33:43.485 --> 00:33:46.365
You should have no doubts about yourself,

00:33:46.485 --> 00:33:49.405
that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:33:49.525 --> 00:33:52.365
Some people falsely have.

00:33:53.005 --> 00:33:55.205
They are bhoots but they say no we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:33:55.325 --> 00:33:56.845
That’s not the thing.

00:33:59.845 --> 00:34:05.085
The discretion power becomes so beautiful

00:34:05.205 --> 00:34:08.685
of the Hamsa Chakra, because they are all connected,

00:34:08.805 --> 00:34:12.205
the Vishuddhi, Hamsa and Virata.

00:34:12.325 --> 00:34:16.925
They are all connected centers.

00:34:17.045 --> 00:34:20.805
It is not only that the Virata improves,

00:34:20.925 --> 00:34:25.125
but the Vishuddhi improves and Hamsa.

00:34:26.485 --> 00:34:31.885
So now what happens that you jump into collectivity.

00:34:32.005 --> 00:34:37.045
Collectivity is the blessing of Viratangana.

00:34:38.765 --> 00:34:46.085
She teaches you how to love each other.

00:34:47.045 --> 00:34:52.165
She teaches you how to enjoy other Sahaja Yogis.

00:34:53.445 --> 00:35:00.885
She teaches you how to have bhakti in your heart.

00:35:03.525 --> 00:35:09.725
But that teaching is like innate.

00:35:10.365 --> 00:35:14.005
If I say She teaches, means you are the disciple

00:35:14.125 --> 00:35:16.165
and She is the teacher, No, No.

00:35:16.285 --> 00:35:20.525
You become Viratangana yourself.

00:35:20.645 --> 00:35:26.405
And the love and the affection and the understanding

00:35:26.525 --> 00:35:31.085
that you have for each other is remarkable,

00:35:31.205 --> 00:35:35.205
is very enjoyable and very beautiful.

00:35:36.085 --> 00:35:38.405
So all that happens,

00:35:38.525 --> 00:35:42.605
absolutely happens in your brain.

00:35:42.725 --> 00:35:47.845
That’s how your brain, which is

00:35:48.765 --> 00:35:53.205
the one which receives all the information

00:35:53.325 --> 00:35:57.045
and creates all the information,

00:35:57.165 --> 00:36:00.885
creates all the mental projections

00:36:01.005 --> 00:36:06.805
becomes a new vehicle to create a dimension

00:36:06.925 --> 00:36:10.445
which goes higher, not declining.

00:36:12.685 --> 00:36:16.565
All of you are part and parcel of that, all of you

00:36:16.685 --> 00:36:21.805
are part and parcel of that and all of you are important.

00:36:21.925 --> 00:36:24.525
All of you have to support that,

00:36:24.645 --> 00:36:26.965
all of you have to raise it.

00:36:27.085 --> 00:36:28.605
It is very important;

00:36:28.725 --> 00:36:36.485
you all should understand your own responsibility.

00:36:36.605 --> 00:36:42.125
So between South and North America

00:36:42.245 --> 00:36:48.645
we have to at least have 16,000 Sahaja Yogis.

00:36:56.925 --> 00:36:58.605
Krishna was very clever,

00:36:58.725 --> 00:37:02.925
He created his 16,000 powers into ladies.

00:37:04.085 --> 00:37:08.325
Then these 16,000 women were taken away

00:37:08.445 --> 00:37:13.685
by one king and he just kept them.

00:37:13.805 --> 00:37:19.205
So Shri Krishna went and defeated that king

00:37:19.325 --> 00:37:25.805
and brought all the 16,000 powers to himself, very nice.

00:37:26.245 --> 00:37:29.125
He could do all those tricks, not Me.

00:37:29.245 --> 00:37:34.925
I have to have 16,000 children who are human beings

00:37:35.045 --> 00:37:38.965
and who get this power within them.

00:37:39.085 --> 00:37:44.605
Not like my own powers I manifest. What is the use?

00:37:44.725 --> 00:37:46.965
You can’t give realization to others,

00:37:47.085 --> 00:37:50.965
you cannot communicate towards others, you cannot do anything with them.

00:37:51.085 --> 00:37:55.405
So Shri Krishna only told Gita, finished.

00:37:55.525 --> 00:38:00.645
They were clever people, they didn’t want to face the problem.

00:38:02.325 --> 00:38:03.845
It’s very difficult.

00:38:03.965 --> 00:38:07.565
You people have a bad Vishuddhi, I get it.

00:38:07.685 --> 00:38:10.525
You people have a problem, I get it.

00:38:10.645 --> 00:38:13.285
It's just collectively to work out.

00:38:13.405 --> 00:38:17.725
To take you inside my body as a cell

00:38:17.845 --> 00:38:23.045
and to cleanse it, it’s very very difficult task

00:38:23.165 --> 00:38:25.525
but one has to do it.

00:38:26.085 --> 00:38:30.285
One has to do it and one will do it.

00:38:30.405 --> 00:38:35.125
I’m sure one day when you all will be

00:38:35.245 --> 00:38:40.965
completely aware of Viratangana power within yourself,

00:38:41.085 --> 00:38:45.085
I don’t know what will happen to this country.

00:38:45.205 --> 00:38:50.085
As it is I find it is just bubbling now, about to break.

00:38:50.205 --> 00:38:54.165
It’s a big breakthrough I find this year,

00:38:54.845 --> 00:39:02.005
among Sahaja Yogis as well as among the other people.

00:39:02.165 --> 00:39:05.805
But there was another quality of Shri Krishna

00:39:05.925 --> 00:39:10.885
was diplomacy, is to be diplomatic.

00:39:11.005 --> 00:39:13.685
With others you have to be diplomatic.

00:39:13.805 --> 00:39:17.925
You should not just jump on them and try to oppress them,

00:39:18.045 --> 00:39:20.045
or in any way try to show

00:39:20.165 --> 00:39:22.005
that they are nowhere compared to you, No.

00:39:22.125 --> 00:39:24.885
You should say that we were like you, worse than you.

00:39:25.005 --> 00:39:29.205
Then people are happy. But see now we have changed.

00:39:29.325 --> 00:39:33.405
Somebody says that “I was smuggling drugs

00:39:33.525 --> 00:39:37.965
you should say no I was smuggling even arms”.

00:39:41.485 --> 00:39:44.925
Then their ego will not be hurt,

00:39:45.045 --> 00:39:47.565
if their ego is not hurt then it’s easy.

00:39:47.685 --> 00:39:50.605
So diplomacy also you must learn.

00:39:50.725 --> 00:39:54.765
Also Diplomacy is a mental projection at a lower level.

00:39:54.885 --> 00:40:03.645
At a higher level diplomacy is where is your charisma,

00:40:03.765 --> 00:40:08.165
where you attract people, where you capture them.

00:40:08.285 --> 00:40:12.365
How you talk to them, how you behave towards them.

00:40:12.485 --> 00:40:15.645
And also have a compassion, because

00:40:15.765 --> 00:40:17.765
you are now sitting on the Himalayas,

00:40:17.885 --> 00:40:20.005
but what about these poor people.

00:40:20.125 --> 00:40:23.845
In that way if you see the whole thing I am sure

00:40:23.965 --> 00:40:28.245
you will not feel so much

00:40:28.365 --> 00:40:32.805
that you are doing this work and that work.

00:40:35.525 --> 00:40:40.405
Shri Krishna’s whole philosophy is like this.

00:40:40.525 --> 00:40:43.205
That you should get your “Ghyana”.

00:40:43.325 --> 00:40:46.965
Ghyana is Ghy means Gnostics,

00:40:47.085 --> 00:40:49.845
you have to become Gnostics means

00:40:49.965 --> 00:40:51.885
on your central nervous system

00:40:52.005 --> 00:40:54.565
you must know it. That’s the first thing.

00:40:54.685 --> 00:40:59.485
The second thing was because Arjuna was so half-hearted,

00:40:59.605 --> 00:41:03.005
still he asked him questions.

00:41:11.645 --> 00:41:14.165
So he said,

00:41:18.885 --> 00:41:24.165
“What about Karma? Everybody talks of Karma.”

00:41:24.285 --> 00:41:26.925
Again diplomacy.

00:41:27.765 --> 00:41:30.325
The whole Gita is full of diplomacy

00:41:30.445 --> 00:41:33.765
and normal human beings can’t understand.

00:41:33.885 --> 00:41:40.125
So he said, “Yes of course, you must do your Karmas,

00:41:40.245 --> 00:41:46.565
but you have to surrender your karmas at My Lotus Feet.

00:41:46.685 --> 00:41:49.165
No not possible.

00:41:49.925 --> 00:41:55.085
Very clever because as long as you have

00:41:55.205 --> 00:41:59.085
“I am doing this, I am doing that” idea,

00:41:59.205 --> 00:42:03.845
how can you put your karmas onto the feet of Shri Krishna.

00:42:05.205 --> 00:42:07.525
That means you should get your realization

00:42:07.645 --> 00:42:10.845
where you know you that you are not doing anything.

00:42:10.965 --> 00:42:13.965
When that happens that you know you are not doing anything,

00:42:14.085 --> 00:42:19.965
at that time the Karma becomes Akarma.

00:42:21.285 --> 00:42:24.525
And how you talk, I’ve seen people raising Kundalini

00:42:24.645 --> 00:42:27.205
saying, “Mother, it doesn’t rise, it doesn’t work.

00:42:27.325 --> 00:42:30.125
You don’t say that, “I am doing it.”

00:42:30.245 --> 00:42:33.485
You just say, “It doesn’t rise, it doesn’t work out.”

00:42:33.605 --> 00:42:38.205
in the third person. Another is about Bhakti,

00:42:38.325 --> 00:42:44.685
because now we have lots of these Hare Ram’s, Hare Krishna’s

00:42:44.805 --> 00:42:46.885
spoiling their Vishuddhi.

00:42:48.085 --> 00:42:52.845
So for Bhakti He has used only one word.

00:42:52.965 --> 00:42:58.965
He says, “You give me flowers, you give me water,

00:42:59.085 --> 00:43:02.205
you give me leaves, I’ll take them.”

00:43:02.325 --> 00:43:04.925
But while giving what does He say?

00:43:05.045 --> 00:43:08.405
“But you must do “Ananya Bhakti”.

00:43:08.525 --> 00:43:11.965
“Ananya” means when there is not the other,

00:43:12.085 --> 00:43:15.965
when you become one with Me, when you are connected.

00:43:16.085 --> 00:43:19.045
On “Ananya” word he has danced

00:43:19.165 --> 00:43:21.885
the whole thing and these stupid people don’t know

00:43:22.005 --> 00:43:25.445
that they are not connected as yet and they are talking

00:43:25.565 --> 00:43:30.245
about Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Hare Rama.

00:43:30.365 --> 00:43:32.525
That’s how they are not connected.

00:43:32.645 --> 00:43:35.485
They don’t understand that they have to be connected.

00:43:35.605 --> 00:43:40.205
And this is the trick he has played with all the people

00:43:40.325 --> 00:43:41.845
that “All right, all right

00:43:41.965 --> 00:43:46.845
you go on saying Hare Rama, Hare Rama we’ll see.”

00:43:47.885 --> 00:43:53.405
So the diplomacy part in his case because

00:43:53.525 --> 00:43:58.925
He had to bring them to the point that

00:43:59.045 --> 00:44:02.445
No, No, this doesn’t work out, No this doesn’t work out.

00:44:02.565 --> 00:44:06.245
So then “Gyana. Now what is Gyana is they start reading books,

00:44:06.365 --> 00:44:12.165
No, No. It means 'bodh', means on your central nervous system

00:44:12.285 --> 00:44:17.045
you have to do. So how gradually he brought them to that level.

00:44:17.165 --> 00:44:20.125
In the same way when you are dealing with others

00:44:20.245 --> 00:44:22.925
you have to work it out that way.

00:44:23.045 --> 00:44:26.165
And once you work it out that way,

00:44:26.285 --> 00:44:29.245
you can spread Sahaja Yoga much faster.

00:44:29.365 --> 00:44:31.525
You’ll be a very light person,

00:44:31.645 --> 00:44:33.725
everybody will enjoy you

00:44:33.845 --> 00:44:37.165
and you’ll have no temper, nothing.

00:44:40.725 --> 00:44:43.165
We get into temper because

00:44:43.285 --> 00:44:46.045
we don’t know how to handle the situation.

00:44:46.165 --> 00:44:48.285
If we know how to handle the situation

00:44:48.405 --> 00:44:50.565
we’ll never get angry, on the contrary

00:44:50.685 --> 00:44:55.085
use the anger of another person for your own benefit.

00:44:56.005 --> 00:45:01.125
All these things you learn through the power of Viratangana.

00:45:01.245 --> 00:45:08.005
Viratangana gives you the full detachment

00:45:08.725 --> 00:45:13.045
from every subject of worry.

00:45:13.165 --> 00:45:19.845
She sucks in all this and throws them in the air.

00:45:22.045 --> 00:45:31.645
It is Her great power that has really given you

00:45:31.965 --> 00:45:36.445
such an understanding about life, about yourself.

00:45:36.565 --> 00:45:40.285
Your own value system has changed.

00:45:40.965 --> 00:45:46.165
If you see what a change it was for you,

00:45:46.285 --> 00:45:53.685
all this transformation, everything is the power of Viratangana.

00:45:53.805 --> 00:45:59.285
And ultimately what She gives you is “Nirananda”.

00:45:59.405 --> 00:46:08.805
Is the joy, joy and nothing else but joy.

00:46:10.485 --> 00:46:12.845
May God bless you.

00:46:37.038 --> 00:46:38.284
(Shri Mataji compliments Gregoire.)

00:46:38.405 --> 00:46:43.845
I must give full credit here to Gregoire

00:46:43.965 --> 00:46:50.685
because he came and struggled and fought and like Arjuna you see,

00:46:52.565 --> 00:46:57.405
he felt very desperate and went away.

00:46:57.525 --> 00:47:00.925
He had to go also in any way.

00:47:01.965 --> 00:47:05.085
And suddenly as he is gone,

00:47:05.205 --> 00:47:10.205
I find here is everything so sprouting, so well

00:47:10.325 --> 00:47:14.685
and people have started taking over the responsibility

00:47:14.805 --> 00:47:17.845
of working out Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:17.965 --> 00:47:21.885
But I still remember him at this time

00:47:22.005 --> 00:47:25.485
because he was really very desperate

00:47:25.605 --> 00:47:32.805
and absolutely fed up with the American style of thinking.

00:47:32.925 --> 00:47:36.125
But now we’ll give him a very good news

00:47:36.245 --> 00:47:41.845
that how America has improved.

00:47:53.325 --> 00:47:55.845
We have many Sahaja Yogis in America

00:47:55.965 --> 00:47:57.885
who have been very dedicated

00:47:58.005 --> 00:48:01.645
despite all kinds of negative forces and everything.

00:48:01.765 --> 00:48:04.765
With all the nightmares they have gone through,

00:48:04.885 --> 00:48:07.525
they are stuck on to Sahaja Yoga

00:48:07.645 --> 00:48:14.885
and I find that their efforts are now showing results.

00:48:18.005 --> 00:48:19.605
I will not take their names

00:48:19.725 --> 00:48:22.805
because you know all of them very well one by one.

00:48:22.925 --> 00:48:29.005
But I must say that Steven has done a great contribution.

00:48:29.125 --> 00:48:32.645
I never asked him to come to America.

00:48:32.765 --> 00:48:38.605
But he himself decided and he himself came here on his own

00:48:38.725 --> 00:48:45.165
and he has really contributed a lot to Sahaja Yoga by coming here.

00:48:45.285 --> 00:48:46.605
May God Bless You.

00:48:58.325 --> 00:49:01.925
Of course, your leader is there

00:49:02.045 --> 00:49:05.645
and all the leaders in every place

00:49:05.765 --> 00:49:09.125
have been really working very hard

00:49:09.245 --> 00:49:16.445
and I just see how things are prospered in one-year time.

00:49:16.565 --> 00:49:18.965
It's very creditable.

00:49:19.085 --> 00:49:22.405
We never had so many people for the Puja.

00:49:22.525 --> 00:49:27.725
I am quite surprised as all of you being here.

00:49:27.845 --> 00:49:29.245
Thank you very much.
