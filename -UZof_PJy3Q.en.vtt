1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.640
Okay, we were doing a havan and a puja and this is on the patio outside Shreemashti's

2
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:24.300
house and basically although we had satpal there, Shreemashti was leading the whole puja

3
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.840
and telling us what to do because we didn't have a clue and that puja set you can see

4
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:40.360
there is actually in the castle in Vellore, in the puja silva, a few years ago I couldn't

5
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.760
believe it. So this is a bit further on in months and we're all looking a little bit

6
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:56.560
better, a little bit clearer and wearing more proper clothes and there's Jamal there up

7
00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:04.960
in the, on the, if you're looking at it top right beside Douglas and Pat has got his hidden

8
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:12.040
behind Marie, the lady in the red sari and sitting on the floor with his arm casually

9
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.040
on Shreemashti's knee is Pat's son Kevin who was seven at the time and wrote a very beautiful

10
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:28.240
memory of Douglas if anyone saw it online. This is at the ashram, it's the second ashram

11
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.400
we had actually in Finchley, the first one was in Acton, we were only there for a very

12
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.400
short time but here we were here for, do you know Pat, was it a year or two years, something

13
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:44.200
like that? About a year. About a year, yes. So you can see Pat and you can see Douglas

14
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:55.600
there quite clearly and Gregoire and Tony and myself and Christine and Bogdan on the

15
00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:03.200
top left and this was in the meditation room and it looks like Shreemashti must have cooked

16
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.520
that because I don't know, I don't know, it looks like dal to me and Shreemashti often

17
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:20.920
cooked for us and showed us how to cook. So this must have been 1977, 78 maybe, 77,

18
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:29.520
78. And this, I believe this is outside Cheltenham Road or somewhere near like that but then

19
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.320
there's steps so it could have been one of the seminars Pat. I think it is. Isn't it

20
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.640
the East Hampstead seminar? Yeah, probably East Hampstead, yes, I think you're right.

21
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:51.440
On the steps afterwards. Yeah, I reckon. And there's Douglas in the green suit. Yes, he

22
00:02:51.440 --> 00:03:00.560
always, when he went to India he got suits made for himself in sort of like safari style

23
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:09.920
so he was always very, very well done out, matched out in his suits. Who's the person

24
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:20.200
in that gorgeous fur coat? That's Tony. You know Tony Cooley, Tony Paneotto? Yeah, he's

25
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:30.360
still around somewhere. This looks like from the same time because there's Douglas there.

26
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.760
It's funny you know, since Douglas passed away I get a shock every time I see one of

27
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.240
the pictures of him as he was just before he went because I just keep remembering how

28
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:48.640
he looks there. There's his dark hair and there's Pat in the background. And the little

29
00:03:48.640 --> 00:04:02.840
girl's called Nonny. Nonny, okay. This was in our first trip to India in January 1977

30
00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:10.080
and Greg Waugh calls Pat and Tony, myself, Jane, Evan and Douglas. Douglas slightly in

31
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.760
the shade there. And this is when we went and visited Greg Waugh in Kathmandu where

32
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:21.280
he was working at the time. This was in his garden and we had an amazing time because

33
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.200
when we went to India we were there for three months and we were taken all round by the

34
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:32.360
Sai Jogis and there was always a lot of Sai Jogis and a lot of people which we hadn't

35
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.000
come across because in England there was just the seven of us. But when we went flew to

36
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:48.240
Kathmandu from India, sorry from Pat. Yeah, yeah. It was just who you see there and we

37
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.480
were staying in Greg Waugh's bungalow with Sri Mataji and she worked on us. She first

38
00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:02.720
showed us how to do, oh my God, Adjuan. That's right. She got her shawl and she did the Adjuan

39
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.800
and we all had to go underneath her shawl to inhale it with Sri Mataji and at night

40
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.200
she said you must never do this and go out at night. You always had to cover your head

41
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:21.040
and stay indoors because it opened everything out. So that was our first experience of Adjuan.

42
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:28.360
And also Sri Mataji caught nits from us because we got them from going in the trains and she

43
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:36.120
was combing them out and killing the boots every time she caught one.

44
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.760
Is Gavin taking the photograph? No, well Jane usually took the photograph so in that case

45
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:50.040
who was it, sorry if you go back. No, Gavin's in the back there so I think it was his servant

46
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.280
that took it because we're all there aren't we?

47
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.800
What was his name, Tej or something?

48
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.920
Tej, something like that, yes because Marie didn't get, I don't think Marie was...

49
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.160
No, no she didn't join us until we went back to Mumbai.

50
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.560
Yeah, it was Marie, the French associate who brought Pat and I actually.

51
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.760
Yeah, so I think must have been his servant, yeah.

52
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:26.000
This was at Bawdy, the first time we went there in 1977 for the seminar and we went

53
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.040
down to the beach with Sri Mataji. She worked things out and I think we stood in the sea

54
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.680
didn't we Pat?

55
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.640
Yeah, we did all sorts of things.

56
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.800
You got very ill because it was so hot.

57
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:45.920
Yeah, I did and I went back to our hut and a couple of hours later there was a knock

58
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:54.000
on the door on Sri Mataji to come to see how I was. So I had to hop to a chair in my sleeping

59
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.720
bag and Mother came and gave me some vibrations.

60
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.720
Yeah, you were so ill.

61
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.680
I was ill quite a lot.

62
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.000
We had that havan where they did the thousand names and they sat us right in front of the

63
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000
fire and as the fruit was going black and melting I felt like my face was going black

64
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.360
and melting through that and they did the string all the way around Sri Mataji's head

65
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.880
and all the way around each of her toes and she sat there for the whole time as close

66
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:31.360
to the fire as we were and didn't seem to be affected.

67
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:41.800
And this is when we went to Varanasi and everybody was going off the steps, the gaps and going

68
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.600
in the Holy River but we didn't want to join them so we hired a boat and went out in the

69
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:52.280
river and then jumped in. In some way there I was in there as well in Mysari. There's

70
00:07:52.280 --> 00:08:00.440
Douglas and Pat and Gavin, I don't know who the other random person is around the corner.

71
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:12.440
And this was after, this is actually Sri Mataji's birthday in 1977. We had been to a puja, do

72
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:18.280
you remember Pat, and then we went to the cafe afterwards. So we were all blasted.

73
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.440
This was when Marie joined us.

74
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:29.960
Yes, that's Marie there in the sari next to me. She was from Paris and when Sri Mataji

75
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:39.920
went to Paris in 1980, just before we got married, she stayed in Marie's flat in Paris

76
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.600
and did the meetings from there.

77
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:51.680
And this was us waiting on the railway station for a train to come. Douglas is unperturbed

78
00:08:51.680 --> 00:09:00.200
as always. I think I was reading something on how I was trying to learn Sanskrit.

79
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.480
I always remember him with these neckties like he's got there.

80
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:08.840
Yes, the kachif, he always did, yes, very dashing.

81
00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:15.240
This is after an Ajwain session, we had to cover our heads.

82
00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:25.000
Was this in... I'm not sure. I think it must have been in Gregoire's, or else that flat we stayed in.

83
00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:30.440
It was either in Gregoire's place or in the one we stayed in in Mumbai.

84
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.840
I think it's the one we stayed in in Mumbai, honestly.

85
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.120
And this was in India, definitely.

86
00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:51.000
Yeah, I think this was in Mumbai towards the end. Well obviously because Marie's there again.

87
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.880
Yes, yeah. So this is around Mother's Birthday Puja time.

88
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:08.600
That's when we went round various sites, wasn't it? Is that Pharma Raul there on the left, Pat?

89
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:17.640
A big moustache. That's Raul Bhai's son, the farm in Dulio we stayed in with Sri Masjid.

90
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:29.800
Yeah, we did go to Patipul Sikri, but before that went to a lower an agenda, I think on this bit.

91
00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.560
Yeah, I was ill that time, missed it.

92
00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.060
Yeah.

93
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.760
Yeah, and we went everywhere in our saris and kurtas.

94
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.120
On these beautiful steam trains.

95
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.240
Yeah, fantastic.

96
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:54.440
Yes, so that was the Red Fort, I think, isn't it, Pat?

97
00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.880
I'm not sure, I think so.

98
00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:00.200
Or it could have been that other fort we went to near in Agra.

99
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.520
Yeah, no, I think you're right.

100
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:08.920
Near, because the Taj Mahal, you could see it.

101
00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.240
I thought the Red Fort was the one near Agra.

102
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.720
I thought it was in Delhi, anyway.

103
00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.280
The Red Fort is in Delhi.

104
00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.320
In Delhi, okay.

105
00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.720
Yeah, I'm not sure which one that is.

106
00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.040
Yeah, I'm not sure which one that is.

107
00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:28.440
Yeah, so yeah, I mean, Sri Masjid made sure that we got and saw some amazing things,

108
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.720
because we were there three months.

109
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:31.820
Fantastic.

110
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.640
Well, some of the time, yeah, a lot of the time she just sent us off.

111
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:40.600
Yeah, I think now maybe it was to give the poor Sahaj Yogis a break.

112
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.080
Yeah, yeah, we just travelled by ourselves.

113
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:43.580
Yeah.

114
00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:56.220
Yeah, we know that the Taj Mahal is in Agra, and Fatih Pulisikwe, we went from Agra to visit it.

115
00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:01.660
But there was another fort we went to, another palace in Agra that was near.

116
00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:05.180
It's the one that he was in, and he looked across and built.

117
00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.100
He was only allowed to eat channa or something, and look at his...

118
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:14.780
He was in prison there, wasn't it? The guy who built it by his son, something like that.

119
00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:16.880
Yes.

120
00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:18.860
It was all amazing anyway.

121
00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.020
Yeah, it was absolutely incredible.

122
00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:31.660
This was 1977.

123
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.020
They're asking which year it was.

124
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.060
1977.

125
00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:37.440
March.

126
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:43.340
January to March, yeah. We were there from January to March, to Mother's birthday.

127
00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:44.780
1977, yeah.

128
00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.820
This is jumping forward a few years.

129
00:12:56.060 --> 00:13:01.420
This will be in Switzerland, Guru Puja, 1984.

130
00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.740
You can see Douglas there with Devyani.

131
00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.460
The hatterhorn is there on the right.

132
00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:10.960
Yeah, yeah.

133
00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:14.860
What year did they marry?

134
00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.020
That's the same as us, wasn't it, Krishna?

135
00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:22.780
It's later than that, Pat.

136
00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.020
Well, we were just married, but we were fixing up his flat.

137
00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.020
I know, 81.

138
00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:30.380
81, maybe, yeah.

139
00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:31.900
Yeah, the next year, definitely, I think.

140
00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:39.420
This is in 1984 in Zermatt, this Puja, yes.

141
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:43.900
We were all there, yeah. We were all there.

142
00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:47.980
This you can recognize. This is at the farm.

143
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:48.480
Yeah.

144
00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:55.340
This is Douglas and Devyani having their lunch.

145
00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.580
We can share these pictures with you, of course.

146
00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:04.300
We can put all the dates on them later on.

147
00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.540
OK, next one.

148
00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.780
So this is already Douglas. I can comment now about this.

149
00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:18.300
Douglas in India, another one.

150
00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:24.380
Douglas in India, this is the one that I'm going to share with you.

151
00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.780
This is the one that I'm going to share with you.

152
00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:30.540
In India, another one.

153
00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.660
I think it's the wedding anniversary.

154
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:39.980
With all the Indian yogis, I think it was the Bell's day,

155
00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:42.300
Douglas' Bell's day.

156
00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:44.540
You can see.

157
00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.660
When would that be, Krishna?

158
00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.980
When did they go to India?

159
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:53.820
They went to India four years ago.

160
00:14:54.220 --> 00:15:00.540
So it would be, when would that be? 2018?

161
00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.820
January 2018.

162
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:13.260
Here is the family. One of the people, Deepak,

163
00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.780
and his wife, they looked after Douglas in their place.

164
00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:33.180
And some Indian yogis with Douglas, probably his Bell's day.

165
00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:42.860
This is Deepak, his son and his wife.

166
00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.260
And a friend, I don't know.

167
00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.860
That's probably quite recent, isn't it?

168
00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:53.260
It is a year ago or so.

169
00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:02.860
And also there are some friends, Deepak and his wife and Douglas and a friend.

170
00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:09.900
And this is again, there were lots of people always coming and seeing

171
00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:16.140
Douglas because he was a great celebrity in Noida, you see.

172
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:22.540
So they were all coming to see him and they looked after him really well.

173
00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.860
This is a Bell's day cake, 1981.

174
00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.020
When he was 81.

175
00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.380
When he passed away now, he's 83.

176
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:37.420
Okay.

177
00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:43.980
Okay, this is yet another cards and flowers.

178
00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:47.180
And here, I don't know where this is.

179
00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:51.820
It could be in Noida.

180
00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.860
Yeah, it is a meditation room.

181
00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.380
Meditation room, exactly.

182
00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:03.340
So he's just talking about his time with Shrimataji.

183
00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:06.060
And everybody's listening to him.

184
00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:11.100
So he was really very happy there.

185
00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:14.780
Always well respected.

186
00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:20.380
And here is his photograph, last rites.

187
00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:21.740
It will be tomorrow.

188
00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:30.380
And after that, he actually decided he would be cremated, not buried in the house.

189
00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:31.740
This was his wish.

190
00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.740
So it's going to happen tomorrow.

191
00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:47.100
So now, if we can share some memories of Douglas, little things that we remember.

192
00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:51.900
Well, I'll just talk a little bit about when we first met him.

193
00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.700
And then obviously, we can go perhaps forward a bit.

194
00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:59.580
When Pat first met him before he met Shrimataji.

195
00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:04.620
So he knew him before his realization.

196
00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.820
Yeah, he used to go to the church.

197
00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.500
He used to go to the church.

198
00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.420
And he used to go to the church.

199
00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.340
And he used to go to the church.

200
00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:14.940
Before his realization.

201
00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:23.340
Yeah, he used to go to this hatha yoga lessons in Houston.

202
00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:28.060
And that's where I got to know him.

203
00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.220
I'd already seen I was living in the area.

204
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:32.220
And I'd seen him around.

205
00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.580
And I didn't know him very well.

206
00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:37.820
But after the hatha yoga lessons, we used to go to his flat for tea.

207
00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:43.900
And there was also other yogis there who became yogis.

208
00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.340
So Jane, Gavin's wife.

209
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.460
Christine was around and Marie.

210
00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:56.700
So really, quite a few of us knew each other.

211
00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.060
And Douglas had his flat.

212
00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:05.100
And he was already a great personality in the area.

213
00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:11.900
He's, you know, very gregarious and friendly with everyone.

214
00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:19.500
There was a lot of, there was a whole kind of community there of New Age people who were

215
00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:25.020
all eating what she must have described as concrete or something.

216
00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:26.460
They're muesli.

217
00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:28.700
Brown rice.

218
00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:34.540
And he was, yeah, he used to go around and get all this food, all the food and do all

219
00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:35.020
kinds of stuff.

220
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:42.780
And when I, when I went to first met you matter, the first person I saw was Douglas.

221
00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:46.460
And I thought, you know, what's he doing here?

222
00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:53.660
It's quite, quite funny, really, because I'd actually moved away some weeks, for a few

223
00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:57.020
weeks, to another part of London over to Baker Street.

224
00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:07.020
And during that time, the guy doing the yoga lessons had met Shrimataji at the Indian

225
00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:07.820
Cultural Center.

226
00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:15.260
And several of the people doing the yoga lessons with him had gone to see her as well.

227
00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:21.740
And they had, then they started having meetings at his house, the yoga teacher, Mukhan Shah.

228
00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.620
And then they moved to Gavin Brown's place.

229
00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:31.820
And Maureen and I came to the last, the second or third meeting at Mukhan Shah's place.

230
00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:37.020
And then another move to Gavin Brown's place.

231
00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.540
That was September 1975.

232
00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:41.980
Yeah, yeah.

233
00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.540
So we knew, knew Douglas a bit, not that well.

234
00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:52.060
But, you know, he was quite similar in many ways.

235
00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:53.120
Yeah.

236
00:20:54.380 --> 00:21:00.540
It was interesting, because out of those people, those hippies that Mother was meeting with

237
00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:07.820
at the yoga classes, it boiled down to the six or seven of us, counting Gregor as well,

238
00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:08.320
obviously.

239
00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:15.980
And thinking about it, we were all very different, even though some of us were very different.

240
00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.380
Some of us had been hippies.

241
00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:23.420
And each one of us seemed to epitomize a different sort of person.

242
00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:29.980
And you can see how Shrimataji, which she told us later, she was working on our us to

243
00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:34.300
work out different aspects of mankind to bring them to Sahaja Yoga.

244
00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:39.260
So Douglas was totally unique, I would say.

245
00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:46.380
But he represented a certain sort of people who had been through a very hard time.

246
00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.780
Such a hard time as a child.

247
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:54.540
I mean, he told us some stories, but completely detached about it.

248
00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.060
He never used to get upset.

249
00:21:56.060 --> 00:22:03.340
But I believe, Pat, is it correct, that he lost his mother in some way, and his father

250
00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:06.140
was so harsh that he ran away at the age of five.

251
00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:08.220
Yeah, something, it was all pretty grim.

252
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.740
He lived quite a lonely life, really, although he got involved in things.

253
00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:22.140
He belonged to a motorcycle club and drove around on the continent and over around Algeria

254
00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.580
or somewhere around there.

255
00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:26.620
He said he went right across the Sahara on a motorbike.

256
00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:27.500
Yeah, oh yeah.

257
00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.100
And he worked in a factory for a long time.

258
00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:35.100
And then gradually branched out from there.

259
00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:41.660
But when we knew him, he was living in this area where a lot of hippies were squatting.

260
00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:47.740
But the block where he lived, it used to be a council place, and he was the only one

261
00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:51.980
who kept paying his rent and eventually got rehoused.

262
00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.140
Yeah, he was quite smart of him, really, I think.

263
00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:04.620
He had this amazing basement flat, which was like a kind of cross between a flat and a

264
00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:07.180
workshop with all kinds of gadgets around.

265
00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:11.100
He had his sound system rigged up all around it.

266
00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:14.460
So he could listen to Capitol Radio all the time.

267
00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:20.220
And he was always fixing things and fiddling with things, messing about with things.

268
00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:24.380
And he was just friendly with anyone.

269
00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:29.500
He had quite a lot of quite strange people who used to go through there, and they gradually

270
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.380
got weeded out.

271
00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:39.740
And he, but from quite early on, he just recognized another, and that was it.

272
00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:44.060
He just latched on to mother, and that's all he was interested in.

273
00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:49.100
He wasn't like a great seeker in an intellectual way at all.

274
00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:55.660
But he just had a big heart, and he just wanted to be happy in life.

275
00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.380
And when he saw mother, that was it.

276
00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:00.300
He just was always there.

277
00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:06.860
Yeah, he was born in England, in answer to Rosalind.

278
00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:12.220
Yeah, he just, he actually looks quite Indian, but he was born in England.

279
00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:21.740
And yeah, he was, as you all know, instrumental in recording.

280
00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:27.500
I mean, we, Shumashti got us to start the first meetings at Caxton Hall, and it was

281
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.140
him that organized all the recordings.

282
00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:36.780
He bought his own machines to do it, and then eventually spent the night with the

283
00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:37.820
man.

284
00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:39.820
How much was it, Pat, on some?

285
00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:44.540
£600 on a duplicating machine, which was a lot of money at that time.

286
00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:45.980
Oh, a huge amount.

287
00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:47.580
Thousands of it now.

288
00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:52.380
Yeah, and he just worked all the time, copying tapes for everyone.

289
00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:52.880
Yeah.

290
00:24:53.500 --> 00:25:00.460
It was just this endless whirring noise of this contraption, with huge, and racks of

291
00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:04.380
tapes all over the walls, you know, audio tapes.

292
00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:08.380
And he just, that was his mission in life, really.

293
00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:14.620
Some of the earlier tapes he recorded, I remember, you'd have bursts of various rock

294
00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:19.820
groups would appear by accident, because they'd be no, he'd use them to take over.

295
00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:25.100
You had to take tapes out and turn them round, so there'd be gaps.

296
00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:26.700
Yeah, that's right.

297
00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:29.660
And he busied himself with that.

298
00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:30.620
He was very...

299
00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:35.980
He was very fastidious about keeping the tapes, wasn't he?

300
00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:37.980
Although the rest of his tools and things...

301
00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.260
Oh yes, he had all these racks he'd made.

302
00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:46.860
He was really spot on with them, and in good order, date order.

303
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:48.620
Oh, absolutely, yeah.

304
00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.140
They were all special names.

305
00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:51.840
Yes.

306
00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.080
Yes, he gave a most...

307
00:25:54.720 --> 00:26:03.120
I thought he was really good the way he was able to extract the essence of Mother's Talk

308
00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.280
and label it like that.

309
00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:10.320
And those labels, those names have continued down the years.

310
00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:14.560
And still, you look at it and you go, oh yes, I want to hear that one.

311
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:20.560
And I remember him turning up at Caxton Hall, not only with the recording, but he was

312
00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:26.800
not only with the recording equipment, but also with boxes of cassettes that we could buy.

313
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:32.560
And later on, when Shimadaji wasn't always there at Caxton Hall, he would come and he

314
00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.680
would be the one choosing the talk to play.

315
00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.880
And I remember asking him, how do you know which one to choose?

316
00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:44.640
And as he said, he just looked at them and he just felt vibration, oh, it's this one.

317
00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.960
And he just put that one on.

318
00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.080
Yeah, anyway, it's not my turn yet.

319
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.320
It's everybody's turn.

320
00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:54.960
I can say so much.

321
00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:01.520
That's an important point, Felicity, because he was the first one to just follow what Mother

322
00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:08.320
said and just feel vibrations while we were all trying to figure out complicated, you

323
00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:15.040
know, sort of how it all fitted into the history of mankind seeking and the incarnations and

324
00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:15.440
all that.

325
00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.480
All he would do is just feel the vibrations of anything.

326
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.280
He didn't think about things much.

327
00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:28.160
He just said he would just come out with what vibrations he felt to deal with any situation

328
00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.280
and every situation.

329
00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:35.680
Yeah, I think that was for me, that was his such an incredibly unique quality that he

330
00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.280
just didn't think about things.

331
00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.120
He was just in the vibrations.

332
00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:45.360
The vibrations directed him and dictated, you know, he was surrendered to that.

333
00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.280
And he was an example.

334
00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:51.680
I think he was really an example in our collective at that time.

335
00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:55.280
You know, as you said, someone who didn't didn't intellectualize, didn't think about

336
00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.880
things was just there.

337
00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:04.400
And it was I think, you know, it's not possible to underestimate the importance of having

338
00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:10.480
somebody in the collective who literally is just being that instrument for Mother and

339
00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.440
being there.

340
00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:16.560
And, you know, you see him and you look at him and there's that wonderful example, which

341
00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.160
we used to talk about all the time.

342
00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:23.520
Maybe someone else can tell it better about receiving the phone call from that David on

343
00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.920
the Time magazine.

344
00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:29.120
And he so they had advertised.

345
00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:32.240
So this must have been 79 in the Time magazine.

346
00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:32.800
Time Out.

347
00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.280
Time Out magazine.

348
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.200
Which was slightly different.

349
00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.360
Sorry, it's kind of Seeking magazine, right?

350
00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:46.560
And this fellow rang up and started asking Douglas about it.

351
00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.240
And I can't remember all the details.

352
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:49.760
Maybe someone can fill them in.

353
00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:54.560
But the gist of the story was that I think he was asking what this was all about.

354
00:28:54.560 --> 00:29:01.360
And Douglas told us after he just started raising his Kundalini on the phone, you know,

355
00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.400
through the phone.

356
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:06.720
He could feel the vibrations of this person on the other end of the phone.

357
00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.640
And he started raising his Kundalini.

358
00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:13.360
And then he said to him, have you been doing TM?

359
00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.480
And the fellow said, oh, yeah, yeah, I have.

360
00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.520
How do you know that?

361
00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:24.560
And Douglas knew because Shomarajee had told us that TM people always caught on the same

362
00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:29.520
three chakras, you know, left Swadhisthana, left Vishuddhi, and I think it was left Nabhi

363
00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.120
and Douglas could feel this.

364
00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:36.160
And so he didn't try to engage him in intellectual conversation.

365
00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.400
He just showed him, oh, look, this is what this is.

366
00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.200
You know, Kundalini comes up and you can feel it.

367
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:47.680
He actually read David Baxter's article in Yoga Today, I think it was.

368
00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.240
I think that's what made him ring.

369
00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.840
And then he found us in time out.

370
00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:59.040
So he already was interested in a way, but he was very wary because of he was having

371
00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.480
such a bad time in TM.

372
00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:08.800
And he was very impressed by Douglas cutting on straight away and saying that.

373
00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.400
I could sort of follow that up a little bit.

374
00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.960
So it must have been like fall of 1979.

375
00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.280
I sort of had a sense.

376
00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:30.880
So I came into Sahaja Yoga in the spring of 79 in India.

377
00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.520
Shall I tell my story of how I met Douglas?

378
00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.160
No, why not?

379
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.960
So I got realization in India in Delhi.

380
00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:45.520
There was, it was the tour of 1979 in March and there were only, there were about a dozen

381
00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:46.800
Western yogis there.

382
00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:54.320
And our mother was giving a week's programs every evening in this little bungalow, tent

383
00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.560
in the garden of the bungalow in Delhi.

384
00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.400
And I got realization.

385
00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:03.600
I didn't really understand what it was all about, but I kept going back each night to

386
00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.120
the programs.

387
00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:08.720
And finally, Douglas said to me, Oh, we're all going to Borde for a seminar.

388
00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:09.760
Why don't you come too?

389
00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.760
And I thought, Oh, okay, I'll come.

390
00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:17.600
And apparently other people had said, Oh no, mother, she's catching everywhere.

391
00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.720
And mother said, no, no, she'll be all right.

392
00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:21.600
I heard this later.

393
00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:25.760
And Douglas just kind of took me under his wing and on the train.

394
00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.680
He was the one that talked to me.

395
00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:31.360
And at that point, she hadn't talked in English at all.

396
00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:33.600
So I really didn't know what was going on.

397
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.440
I just knew that I felt nice.

398
00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.360
And I felt good with these people.

399
00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.120
And he gave me my first photo.

400
00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:44.720
Like he obviously had photos on him to be used whenever necessary handed me my first

401
00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.220
photo.

402
00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:53.920
And just such a comforting, normal person, you know, that took an interest.

403
00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:59.200
He just took an interest in people and helped those who needed help.

404
00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:07.840
And later when I came back to England, I went to visit him in his, I went to stay with him,

405
00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.680
must have invited me to come stay overnight.

406
00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:14.960
And I was really impressed because at that time, mother told us all to get up and meditate

407
00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.160
at four in the morning.

408
00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:20.000
And as you said, Pat, he was very good with gadgets and contraptions.

409
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:27.440
And he'd set up this amazing light show alarm system that went off at four in the morning

410
00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:33.520
with like bells and neon lights, you know, so you couldn't possibly not sleep through

411
00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:35.680
this 4 a.m. alarm.

412
00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.000
And, you know, every morning that this went off.

413
00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:44.480
And I remembered him saying, because he obviously could see that I was that I worry, you know,

414
00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:49.200
I had a lot of I worried and was a lot of left side stuff.

415
00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:55.920
And he said to me, you know, like, you do you believe in the power of God?

416
00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.760
And I said, yes, of course, of course I do.

417
00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:05.840
He said, he said, well, don't you think that God has that God has all the power to correct

418
00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.360
any mistakes you might make?

419
00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:13.680
Just the way he said it, it was just like, oh, yes, that's it.

420
00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:14.800
That's it.

421
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:20.160
And it just made such a huge difference to me and just change something in my my mind,

422
00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:24.560
my brain that I just went, oh, I could just go above all this.

423
00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:35.840
So, yeah, and interestingly, about a few years back, I've been trying to verify the date

424
00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:40.480
of a talk of which I was at in in London with Shri Mataji.

425
00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:45.920
And I felt that the date on it is not correct because I was there at that talk.

426
00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:53.360
And I was had contacted him and he replied to me through Skype from India.

427
00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:54.800
I was amazed.

428
00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.680
Suddenly I got this call from Douglas coming from India.

429
00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:58.560
I'd sent an email.

430
00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.040
And so it was very nice.

431
00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.320
I had this opportunity.

432
00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:09.520
I'd always wanted to say thank you from my heart that he had taken care of this damaged

433
00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.280
person and helped me such a lot.

434
00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:14.960
And his eyes sort of twinkled and he said, oh, I see.

435
00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.480
So I must have a special place in your heart then.

436
00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:21.440
And I thought, yes, that's absolutely true.

437
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.760
You know, yes, you do, Douglas.

438
00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:26.880
And I said it was, yeah, very nice.

439
00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:29.760
So I hand on to other people.

440
00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:31.620
Beautiful.

441
00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:39.120
He helped you to come to see Mother Gershner.

442
00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:39.620
Didn't he?

443
00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:41.920
From Caxton Hall.

444
00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:46.720
Yes, of course.

445
00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:50.640
Now, now it's my turn.

446
00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:51.140
Yes.

447
00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:56.800
Well, you know, Douglas, with his gadgets and tapes.

448
00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:01.440
So I went to the first meeting with Shri Mataji.

449
00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:07.520
And when I went for the second time the next Monday, Shri Mataji wasn't there.

450
00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:13.680
But Douglas was there and he was putting on the tape to play.

451
00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:22.080
And I wanted really to find out how to how to how to meet Shri Mataji.

452
00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:30.800
So I asked I asked him if I could have first I ask him, maybe I can help you with the tapes

453
00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:32.800
and the equipment.

454
00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:36.320
So he said, OK.

455
00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:44.960
Then after a while, I ask him, by the way, do you know, could you give me the address

456
00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:45.840
of the ashram?

457
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:52.720
He looked at me and he became quite suspicious, but he tried my Kundalini.

458
00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:57.680
He put his hands above my head and then he said, all right, then.

459
00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:06.720
So next, actually, this was on Sunday.

460
00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:16.480
This was the same week I went to the ashram and there was Sahastrara Pudya.

461
00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:23.200
And Shri Mataji asked me to wash her feet and to decorate her feet.

462
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:32.560
Then she asked me to participate in the haven with 1000 names with translations.

463
00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:41.840
So by the end of the day and then there was a music program in the evening, a musician,

464
00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:45.520
Indian musician came and he played.

465
00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:56.560
So thank you, Douglas, because this was my I mean, it was just amazing because I was

466
00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:57.520
so cleared out.

467
00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:01.600
I was just walking on air when I left the ashram.

468
00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:02.720
So.

469
00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:09.040
Yeah, and this was thanks to Douglas checking my Kundalini.

470
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.040
So and to show how different he was from everyone else.

471
00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:18.560
What happened when you when you are knocked on the door when you first arrived?

472
00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:26.320
Don't you remember the guy who opened the door?

473
00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.760
Oh, excuse me.

474
00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:28.160
Okay.

475
00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:32.160
But I don't want to mention the name, but don't mention the name.

476
00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:38.800
But you see, so Douglas was so different because you see, he knows all my life story.

477
00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:39.520
My husband.

478
00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.000
So, okay.

479
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.960
So yes, because when I knock at the door, so I came to the I came to the ashram that

480
00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.640
was the only seal ashram.

481
00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:56.400
I know first of all, well, I see I have been lemons outside.

482
00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.360
So I say, well, it looks interesting.

483
00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.360
So I knock at the door.

484
00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:07.600
Somebody opens the door and I said I started to chat like I normally would do.

485
00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:13.360
And this person said to me, oh, gosh, I just had two foot soaks.

486
00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:14.880
I had to have a failed one.

487
00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:19.440
I can guess who that was.

488
00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:30.960
So I was thinking, well, I couldn't quite understand, but I just felt maybe it was not

489
00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:35.600
appropriate for me to to actually say anything.

490
00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:40.480
But nevertheless, she asked me to participate in the project.

491
00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.080
So you see, that was right.

492
00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:49.040
And he was very much sort of in tune with the vibration.

493
00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:57.840
Yeah, I was remembering with Gresner about and I hope that that Maureen you might remember,

494
00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:05.440
but I remember that this was again in the fall of 79, I think that suddenly we got

495
00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.160
this message.

496
00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:10.160
I got this message that we were all to go to Douglas's flat.

497
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:14.960
And I think the message was he was cooking us all dinner, but whatever it was, we should

498
00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.000
all go to his flat.

499
00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:21.520
So we were there, most of us, the small collective in his flat.

500
00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:30.640
And suddenly the door opened and Shrimataji arrived and she arrived with a birthday cake.

501
00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:38.320
And and she said, and Douglas and Douglas hadn't told anyone if he had, I certainly

502
00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:38.720
didn't know.

503
00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:42.800
I don't think I got the impression it was a complete surprise to everyone.

504
00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.720
And he said, Oh, mother, how did you know?

505
00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:45.680
How did you know?

506
00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.680
And she said, of course, you're my son.

507
00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.680
I know, I know these things.

508
00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:57.520
And it for me, I felt this was such a I felt mother had come especially to show people

509
00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.000
that Douglas was special, was important.

510
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.040
We were all special.

511
00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:05.920
But at that time, there were there were a lot of other people in the collective who

512
00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.440
aren't here now.

513
00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:14.720
And sometimes I felt this attitude that Douglas was a bit, you know, he wasn't intellectual.

514
00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:18.000
So we did people didn't always respect him very well.

515
00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:24.640
And yet Shrimataji came and I just felt now she's saying, you know, this is Douglas, my

516
00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:25.200
son.

517
00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.720
He is worthy of respect.

518
00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:31.040
It was a very significant for me that this happened.

519
00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:35.520
And Gretchen, maybe I shall read the little bit that you sent me Gretchen from Mother's

520
00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.440
Talk, which was very sweet.

521
00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:37.920
And she's this.

522
00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.120
So this is Mother's words.

523
00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:43.040
And she said, like we had one Douglas Fry with us.

524
00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:46.160
And I suddenly asked him, what about your birthday?

525
00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.760
He was taken aback.

526
00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:50.080
He didn't know he's sitting here.

527
00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.880
He didn't know how I knew that his birthday was there.

528
00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:56.080
And he really had a rebirth from the life he had.

529
00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:00.000
And when I said, he said, how do you know, mother?

530
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.960
I said, I know about your birthday.

531
00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:08.560
And I went to his house and I saw him and I was so overjoyed to see him settle down.

532
00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:13.440
It is amazing how your seed grows and how fragrant you become.

533
00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:20.240
And I thought that little speech is so typical of Srimataji.

534
00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:29.040
How she, we would have these programs at Caxton Hall and many people would come and get realization.

535
00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:33.120
And she wouldn't, you wouldn't know who she would pay attention to.

536
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:39.120
Like sometimes, you know, like it could be like the person in the suit looking very normal

537
00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:41.600
and everything, and she could completely ignore him.

538
00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:46.000
And one time there was this lady came like a bag lady, a homeless lady.

539
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:52.480
And I remember people kind of like not really wanting to be with her or spend time.

540
00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:55.440
And after she'd left, mother said something like,

541
00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:58.560
oh, you don't know what a deep soul, you know, what a special soul.

542
00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:03.440
And I really felt she taught us not to judge people on the surface.

543
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.720
And she, of course, knew who everyone was inside.

544
00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:14.800
And she was very proud of those who came up from nothing.

545
00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:21.760
And she, I can remember because I had a, you know, a lot of us in those early days had

546
00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:24.720
difficulties in their chakras and I had very weak left side.

547
00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:29.440
And I remember her once turning and saying, and look at Felicity, see how she's come up.

548
00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:35.280
You know, she was just, she was just so proud that, you know, that her vibrations and everything.

549
00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:42.880
And I remember her saying about another yogi, you know, if she just has to stick on,

550
00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.400
she sticks on, she'll be fine.

551
00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.200
She'll be fine.

552
00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:52.800
You know, it was very, very gracious, you know, so much kindness and compassion.

553
00:42:53.680 --> 00:43:01.760
And I felt years later we were doing programs with Iranian ladies and they were somehow very

554
00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.240
grateful that we were doing programs.

555
00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:08.720
And they kept trying to say to me, oh, you know, you're so special, you're this and that.

556
00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:11.200
And I kept feeling, no, I'm not.

557
00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:16.000
But I felt like everything in me, I had grown and changed.

558
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:22.880
And that just everything in my being is because of Shomataji is because of absorbing all that

559
00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:24.160
beauty and that grace.

560
00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:31.760
And from being with her, she showed us how to be an enlightened human being, a compassionate

561
00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:32.800
human being.

562
00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:37.520
And these little stories that, you know, we share today, each one of those, you know,

563
00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:39.120
shows her.

564
00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:45.840
And I think even now in our lives when Mother isn't here in her physical form, and you hear

565
00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:56.240
this from so many newer yogis, how they feel her presence and her grace and compassion

566
00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.120
in their lives.

567
00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:01.600
But I really, I always liked the birthday story one.

568
00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:04.160
I thought that was, and she came with a cake.

569
00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.920
She came with a birthday cake.

570
00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:08.800
Were you there, Maureen?

571
00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.800
Yeah, I believe I was, yes.

572
00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:12.400
Remembering.

573
00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:14.400
And Marilyn, was Marilyn.

574
00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.480
Marilyn must have some stories about that.

575
00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:19.760
Yes, I do.

576
00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:30.000
I want to talk about seeing Douglas's Halo, because on that first seminar he captured

577
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.720
Tarp, and I knew him as the guy in the green suit, because I was very shy.

578
00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:39.680
And I just used to watch him.

579
00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:43.040
He would say to someone, how are you?

580
00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:45.040
Or should I be asking, how am I?

581
00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:46.800
Some things like that.

582
00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:49.440
And we're all sitting out on the lawn.

583
00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:55.920
Mother had said that all these, you know, as yogis, perhaps you look at the sun.

584
00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.240
You can actually stare straight at the sun.

585
00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:00.480
We have that power as yogis.

586
00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:05.200
But I knew I couldn't, because I couldn't really cope with the sun in my face.

587
00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:06.000
I just couldn't.

588
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.040
So everyone started to look at the sun, but I was looking at everybody else rather than

589
00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:11.920
looking at the sun.

590
00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:16.080
And I looked it over at the guy in the green suit, Douglas.

591
00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:22.560
And there was a sun, there was like a golden globe all around his head as he was watching

592
00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:23.520
the sun.

593
00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:27.280
And it wasn't anything on my retina, because I looked away.

594
00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:31.440
I looked here, I looked there, I looked back, and there was a golden globe around Douglas's

595
00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:32.080
head.

596
00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:35.840
And I looked somewhere else, and I looked, and in the end I said to Bart, who was near

597
00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.800
me, Bart, look, the guy in the green suit.

598
00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:42.480
And there was a golden halo all around him.

599
00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.400
And Bart was saying, I can't see anything.

600
00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:47.680
And so I was still, it was there for so long.

601
00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:52.320
And all the time that Douglas was looking at the sun, there was this golden globe.

602
00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.960
And I was thinking, is that his halo?

603
00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:58.720
Or did she come down to greet him?

604
00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:01.360
I mean, what's it so powerful?

605
00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:07.200
And it was, I mean, fast forward seven years later, we were sitting around the table at

606
00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:09.600
Hounslow, and I told Douglas what I'd seen.

607
00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:15.440
And in his most sweet humble way, he said, oh, yeah, that would have been my ego.

608
00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.880
I was a lot in my ego in those days.

609
00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:28.640
Don't try to make me look special, you know.

610
00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:29.360
Very sweet.

611
00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:34.320
Very, very expensive, very lovely Douglas.

612
00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:41.120
I just wanted to say that we have, do we have Derek because he was going to speak to tonight?

613
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.120
And I can't see.

614
00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:44.160
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

615
00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:48.640
Let me just, yes.

616
00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.400
You can see our stories.

617
00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.040
Yeah.

618
00:46:51.040 --> 00:47:01.360
So my first time in Chelsea Road, I, last Saturday, they asked me to tell some stories

619
00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:02.240
at Flood Street.

620
00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:05.520
So I'll just repeat some of those stories.

621
00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:14.960
So when I was in Chelsea Road, I discovered that Douglas was the one you could get tapes

622
00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:15.200
from.

623
00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:21.840
And I just bought an encyclopedia dictionary, Hindu encyclopedia dictionary, because I listened

624
00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:25.440
to Bristol Sergio Gies had given me some talks of dramaturgy.

625
00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:28.080
And there was lots of words which I couldn't understand.

626
00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:36.480
So I got this book, and then I spoke to Douglas, and I said, oh, can I have a tape for each

627
00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:37.040
chakra?

628
00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:38.640
As I said, there's seven chakras.

629
00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:41.440
We don't, we didn't have all the literature, which we have now.

630
00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:44.160
So he was very quick and efficient.

631
00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:49.120
He gave me all the tapes, one for each chakra, I listened to those.

632
00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:57.920
And what I discovered is that I was also interested in all that technical equipment and talks

633
00:47:58.160 --> 00:47:59.520
and stuff like that.

634
00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:05.440
And what people don't realize is that even just to do the recordings, you have to maintain

635
00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:07.680
the equipment, clean the heads.

636
00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:11.680
It's not just you buy a cassette and put, you know, something in.

637
00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:17.440
And I remember Ballas here at the moment being in the Derby ashram afterwards.

638
00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:24.640
And they used to, the people doing all that type of stuff used to be copying tapes with

639
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:28.320
the fast high speed copier and sending them all around the world.

640
00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:34.880
And I remember the Swiss used to be getting orders sent in.

641
00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:39.680
So he made sure, as well as naming them, he made, he did that.

642
00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:46.320
And also people don't know that he made a list, which we can post out later on of all

643
00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:49.200
the tapes he made and copied.

644
00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:54.560
And I've been trying to continue his legacy because there's quite a few of the, Chumash

645
00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:57.200
actually gave over 500 talks in England.

646
00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:03.840
And we've just got over, there's a hundred like missing of those early talks.

647
00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:06.320
So we're trying to track them down.

648
00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:10.480
But because Douglas named them all, we've got a good starting point.

649
00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.800
So we know that they're in people's houses.

650
00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:19.360
So we hope if anyone wants to get involved with that, let me know after.

651
00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:24.080
The other thing is when we went on the first India, one of the first tours I went on, we

652
00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:30.400
bought lots of equipment to donate to the Indian Sahaja Yogis so that they could also

653
00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:31.680
carry on the same thing.

654
00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:33.760
So he had that forward vision.

655
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:36.080
Derek, when would that have been?

656
00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:45.200
That was, this was in the early eighties, 82, 83, something like that, where Douglas

657
00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:52.720
bought equipment to donate to Indian Sahaja Yoga, because there was more than one place

658
00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:55.440
and the equipment was quite expensive.

659
00:49:55.440 --> 00:50:02.560
So this was before Paul Winter brought the BBC quality cameras.

660
00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:08.960
So to have somebody with that foresight was just amazing.

661
00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:18.880
And I remember being in Exeter, just to tell a story, and we had, we were waiting for Srimath

662
00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:24.000
we were waiting for Srimathji to appear on the TV.

663
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:31.360
She went to the TV station and we're all there waiting for it to come on the TV.

664
00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:41.040
And some tea, hot tea got spilled on Douglas and he didn't, it was like, nothing was, he

665
00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.560
didn't react at all.

666
00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:46.720
He was just, you know, anyone else would be like, ah, what's going on?

667
00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:56.480
He was just completely unfazed by anything and nothing was ever too much trouble.

668
00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:01.280
And I just remembered that was then I think 82, 83 went to Exeter.

669
00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:08.160
And I remember later on when I was at the castle, people don't realise the sensitivity

670
00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:13.760
what we're talking about is he could feel at the time I remember in the eighties, every

671
00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:20.080
time a false guru came to London, Srimathji would give different mantras, different techniques

672
00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:27.040
to use, because there's a talk, there's several talks where she said there was 16 rakshasas

673
00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:27.840
who came along.

674
00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:34.400
So every time someone came, but Douglas had like memorised everything.

675
00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:40.800
So as soon as we were at a public programme or anywhere, he knew exactly what to do.

676
00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:45.920
So like, clear somebody out and work on somebody and help.

677
00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:53.520
And I remember being in Cabela, and we had somebody who wouldn't leave the castle.

678
00:51:54.320 --> 00:52:00.080
And we, we managed to persuade Douglas to take him back to England, because he said,

679
00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:02.640
I can't fly, and he's living in America.

680
00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:05.920
And then Douglas said to him, oh, do you smoke?

681
00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:06.640
Do you smoke?

682
00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:09.280
He said yes.

683
00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:13.760
And he said, could you travel from Cabela to England without smoking?

684
00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:15.280
And the person said no.

685
00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:19.920
So he said, you better take all your luggage out of my Land Rover.

686
00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:24.640
So he wasn't going to tolerate any anything.

687
00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:26.800
He was quite straightforward.

688
00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:36.320
So and also, I remember him running the meeting with Mio in Walthamstow for, I don't know,

689
00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:39.520
years and years, used to go set it all up.

690
00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:43.360
So he must have been given realisation to thousands of people over the years.

691
00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:52.960
And also he and giving lifts to everybody, and making sure everybody was was well and

692
00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:53.600
looked after.

693
00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:56.480
So that's it.

694
00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:02.560
I see we have Bala and Kay.

695
00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:03.440
Yes.

696
00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:07.520
They want to say something.

697
00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:08.880
Yeah, that's mine finished.

698
00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:10.240
Lovely.

699
00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:14.320
Bala, you're going to speak up?

700
00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:20.960
If they want to say something, but if not.

701
00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:22.640
Okay.

702
00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.240
Kay is there.

703
00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:25.520
What about Patricia?

704
00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:26.800
I saw Patricia.

705
00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:29.360
She says she can't speak.

706
00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:32.000
She can hear us and see us, but she can't speak.

707
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:37.040
But I can read the tribute now at the end.

708
00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:47.040
I can read the tribute of the family of Deepak, whose family, he and his family looked after

709
00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:48.880
Douglas for the last four years.

710
00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:58.160
And he, you can see also very, very much from the heart, and it's very much really like

711
00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:10.320
Douglas really, Deepak, just feeling so grateful to the Divine for bringing Douglas and Devyani

712
00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:11.120
to their house.

713
00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:14.080
Okay, so I start reading the tribute.

714
00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:20.000
Okay, I just so you can just one second.

715
00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:22.000
Okay.

716
00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:23.360
Even.

717
00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:38.560
Okay, I first read the tribute and then we can do maybe somebody wants to say something

718
00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:39.040
else.

719
00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:51.200
Even before we were told that we had been chosen to take care of Mr. Douglas Fry and

720
00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:56.640
his wife Devyani Fry, who are shifting to India from the UK.

721
00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:07.040
Maybe I can wait a minute so you can see me reading it because

722
00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:12.320
I can see Felicity.

723
00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:13.440
I can see myself.

724
00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:17.520
So can you see me reading?

725
00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:18.240
We can see you.

726
00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:19.520
You can see me.

727
00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:19.760
Okay.

728
00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:23.920
You can see now, Gresha, now you put your camera back on.

729
00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:24.720
Sure, sure.

730
00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:25.220
Okay.

731
00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:34.080
So, okay.

732
00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:40.080
So again, I say even before we were told that we had been chosen to take care of Mr. Douglas

733
00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:44.880
and his wife, Mr. Devyani Fry, who are shifting to India from the UK.

734
00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:50.160
My wife, Parul, had started getting in a voice.

735
00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:51.040
Be prepared.

736
00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:54.400
A very big responsibility is coming to you.

737
00:55:54.400 --> 00:56:03.600
I also had a dream in which Sri Nirmal Ganesha came on White House and ordered me to do some

738
00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:04.320
work for him.

739
00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:07.600
I went to do the work without thinking.

740
00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:13.200
And when I came back, he had left a message of love for us.

741
00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:16.000
That's what Deepak is saying.

742
00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:23.360
Before and after the arrival, when we got to know that Douglas and his wife were in

743
00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:31.040
and his wife wanted to come to India and stay with us in the greater Noida, we felt tremendous

744
00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:32.080
vibrations.

745
00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:37.360
And even without knowing much about them, we sent a message to them that they were most

746
00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:41.760
welcome to come and stay with us for as long as they wished.

747
00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:53.200
On the day of the arrival in India, that was on 18th of January, 2018, I was in

748
00:56:53.200 --> 00:57:01.440
my office and my wife called me to tell me that Douglas and Devyani, he calls them Douglas

749
00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:05.120
uncle and Devyani auntie, just arrived at home.

750
00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:07.040
I immediately left my office.

751
00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:13.040
Throughout my journey back home, I had been getting tremendous vibrations.

752
00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:20.240
When I met them at the house, we felt as if all Ganas had arrived with them in the form

753
00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:21.200
of vibrations.

754
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:28.320
Devyani auntie brought a teddy with herself from UK to India.

755
00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:33.840
When we asked her teddy's name, she replied, this is my Deepak.

756
00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:39.840
And of course, this man's name is also Deepak, which she didn't actually know.

757
00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:47.600
Since that moment, by grace of Shrimataji, I felt strong bonding in my soul with both

758
00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:50.960
of them through these divine vibrations.

759
00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:57.840
So Shrimataji had already made a connection between them and us, a connection that we

760
00:57:57.840 --> 00:57:59.520
have always felt since then.

761
00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:10.880
Staying with them for more than four years, we really think our holy mother forever, that

762
00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:12.880
she chose us to look after them.

763
00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:20.800
Douglas, Papa and Devyani auntie are not only Sahaj Yogis, but we can say for sure that

764
00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:23.120
they are the Ganas of Shri Adishakti.

765
00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:32.160
They were sent here by Shrimataji just for some work to be done as per her will.

766
00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:38.720
Through them, Shrimataji taught us small, small things and helped us grow deeper and

767
00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:40.720
deeper in Sahaja Yoga meditation.

768
00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:47.600
For example, whenever we or anybody talked to them, they answered through vibrations

769
00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:50.320
only and it always worked out.

770
00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:54.880
We saw their intense love for us and also the power of detachment.

771
00:58:55.520 --> 00:59:01.520
They always enjoyed the company of Sahaja Yogis and liked to give joy to everyone.

772
00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:07.280
They were always demonstrating by personal example that a yogi should be like that.

773
00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:16.000
Every day, Douglas and Devyani taught us all kinds of Shrimataji's love and lessons.

774
00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:22.880
I was amazed to find that through the divine attention and guidance of Shrimataji, all

775
00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:29.200
the kind of official work relating to obtaining visa, etc., for uncle and auntie from the

776
00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:32.640
government departments were completed without any hassle.

777
00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:38.480
Shrimataji had always been guiding me with proper directions, knowledge through divine

778
00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:39.280
attention.

779
00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:41.280
It was also amazing.

780
00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:42.320
It was teamwork.

781
00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:50.400
Since the year 2019 onwards, Shrimataji involved Mona Barya from UK and together we have been

782
00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:54.400
working day and night to take care of Douglas and Devyani.

783
00:59:56.400 --> 01:00:00.000
And the joint work has been going on amazingly.

784
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:07.280
Without Shrimataji's guidance and blessings of strength, patience and of course, vibrations,

785
01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.360
it could not have been possible.

786
01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:15.520
Interestingly, everything has been working out as per the wishes of Douglas's Papa.

787
01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:24.400
We have been witnessing for the last more than four years that whatever he wished for,

788
01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:29.520
Shrimataji has worked out perfectly.

789
01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:34.240
That shows that he was always in the attention of Shri Adi Shakti.

790
01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.880
Thanks to Shrimataji again and again.

791
01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:42.160
Also thanks to our loving Douglas and Devyani auntie for everything.

792
01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:44.720
This is from Deepak.

793
01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:47.200
Beautiful.

794
01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:53.840
It's fantastic that they managed to end their days there instead of in a home in London,

795
01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:54.720
separated.

796
01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:56.480
It was their fate.

797
01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:57.120
Absolutely.

798
01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:03.520
And what the courage, what an aversion.

799
01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:06.000
It's a very beautiful experience.

800
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.080
It's a very beautiful experience.

801
01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.000
It's a very beautiful experience.

802
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.160
It's a very beautiful experience.

803
01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:22.880
So what the courage, what an adventurous nature of Douglas to run away from India in a wheelchair

804
01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:29.360
to India to stay with somebody he didn't know.

805
01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:36.880
And the thing is that, but also it's such an amazing, we are very grateful.

806
01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:47.200
We English yogis are very grateful to all the yogis in Noida for giving love and care

807
01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.560
to Douglas and Devyani.

808
01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:55.040
It's just unbelievable what they have done for them.

809
01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:03.120
Do you think you could post some kind of contact that we could, those of us who would like

810
01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.800
could just write to thank them?

811
01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:08.240
To show how much we appreciate on the group.

812
01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:13.840
Maybe they already got all your memories that you wrote on community.

813
01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:16.560
I compiled everything.

814
01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:19.280
I sent it to them.

815
01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:19.840
Yes.

816
01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:20.400
Yes.

817
01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:24.400
And I'm also saying, and you can write to them.

818
01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:33.440
I will be very happy to, I mean, if you send me everything with your names, I can send

819
01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:38.080
I can forward to Deepak who is looking after everything.

820
01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:45.840
And I'm in touch with Bhushan as well because he's looking after the preparations.

821
01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:55.840
As we are talking somehow, it feels a little different when he, when we first heard and

822
01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:04.400
we started writing the memories, I felt so deeply, such a unique, great soul that mother

823
01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:13.200
had sent to us was leaving now at the end, you know, is gone and will leave a hole, but

824
01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:14.160
it's his time.

825
01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:17.940
Yeah.

826
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.320
Somebody is writing saying, I have a video of Douglas 75th.

827
01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:28.160
And Julie.

828
01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:33.360
Okay.

829
01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:37.280
Now that you're unmuted, do you have any memories that you'd like to share?

830
01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:43.680
Please unmute it.

831
01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:43.920
Okay.

832
01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:44.980
Yeah.

833
01:03:44.980 --> 01:04:03.460
Did Julie, did Julie, Julie Grimshaw had a lot of contact with, you know, helped with

834
01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:05.620
Douglas and his affairs.

835
01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:08.180
Does she have any stories that she would like to share?

836
01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:11.300
Myriad.

837
01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:21.540
It's actually kind of interesting because, Douglas introduced me to snooker.

838
01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:29.060
I'm watching snooker on the TV and we both enjoyed watching Ronnie O'Sullivan.

839
01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:38.420
And he was explaining to me what had happened with mother in, when McEnroe was doing Wimbledon.

840
01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:43.620
Mother told us to watch events that were watched by millions of people because we could send

841
01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:46.100
our vibrations back through the TV.

842
01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:51.780
And so Douglas was carrying on this tradition with the snooker.

843
01:04:51.780 --> 01:05:03.780
And the day before I heard that he'd passed, I just had a really strong desire to watch

844
01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:07.780
some snooker like we used to.

845
01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:13.380
And it was kind of like, he was just sort of saying, you know, bye-bye and don't forget

846
01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:14.020
the snooker.

847
01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:23.380
But yes, I mean, I, I, I took him to India with Barry.

848
01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:32.260
I was Devyani's assistant and Barry was Douglas's assistant because we only found one airline

849
01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:40.260
that would take them without a doctor's certificate because they were both so very poorly and

850
01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:40.740
frail.

851
01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:55.460
And Steve managed to find somewhere that would take them without any kind of doctor's approval.

852
01:05:56.180 --> 01:06:04.020
And we, we were all quite apprehensive about what would, I mean, we knew we were in mother's

853
01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:12.500
care, but what would happen when we got to India and we made Steve promise not to tell the

854
01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:16.260
social services until we landed in India.

855
01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:21.300
And Steve did.

856
01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:32.660
And they were very shocked and they were they rang up Deepak as well to find out.

857
01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:44.020
But it was funny without all this, one knew the turmoil and people who wanted to act and

858
01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:50.180
it was going on, but it's like we were, we were in, in the bubble of vibrations and we

859
01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:58.020
just weren't, we were just watching it, but it was, it was rather fun.

860
01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:05.860
And then when, when we landed, we had two big jeeps.

861
01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:15.780
My Iraqi brother in Delhi, Yogesh had already been down to Noida to meet Deepak and Parul.

862
01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:21.860
Well, he, he, he actually went to see if Douglas could stay in the hospital and he met up with

863
01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:26.900
the collective and he, he rang up and he said, oh, the vibrations were really good for this

864
01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:31.140
couple to look after Douglas and Devyani.

865
01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:35.300
And they, they want to take in their, their making room in their house and everything.

866
01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:46.820
And it just all felt so wonderful and so easy flowing that we just, we just went and with

867
01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:54.740
all the dramas going on outside the bubble it was, it was really quite plain sailing.

868
01:07:55.220 --> 01:08:04.500
And we were, we were in Deepak's house within a couple of hours of landing.

869
01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:09.220
So it all, it all went through very well.

870
01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:16.660
I think if I can just say one thing that always struck me about Douglas was that

871
01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:22.740
he never shied away from so-called danger.

872
01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:31.140
You know, I think he came down to Brighton and somebody had said to him, oh, you don't

873
01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:32.420
want to go up on that hill.

874
01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:35.540
That's where all the witches have their things.

875
01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:40.340
And this is, so of course, we've got the Land Rover out and everybody had to go up there

876
01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:42.740
and we did a pooja on top of this hill.

877
01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:54.420
And another thing that happened was that Mother had said to us to go to all these other religious

878
01:08:54.420 --> 01:09:00.420
places and talk to the people, you know, because they are seeking, they're just not looking

879
01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:01.460
in the right place.

880
01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:12.500
And he took us round to the Buddhists, Ashram, and talked to them about Shri Mataji and how

881
01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:15.300
she had told us about Buddha.

882
01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:25.300
And they were rather taken aback and they sort of said, thank you very much and goodbye.

883
01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:32.500
But the little details Douglas used to remember, like he said, I'm just going to go and put

884
01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:34.500
a daffodil on Buddha's feet.

885
01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:41.380
And he just went into their meditation room and did just that.

886
01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:46.340
So he's very, very brave, very brave.

887
01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:53.060
He never let any negative thoughts come to him.

888
01:09:53.060 --> 01:10:01.140
He never let any negative thoughts in himself and never let them affect anything around

889
01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:01.640
at all.

890
01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:05.700
So, yeah, I think I've said quite a lot.

891
01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:07.880
Lovely.

892
01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:11.860
I just wanted to add to what Jill just said.

893
01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:18.420
Douglas always used to, when people were sick, they were seriously ill.

894
01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:22.340
He would just go and welcome them, you know.

895
01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:31.060
And he could go to hospitals, he could go because he felt that he had these vibrations

896
01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.340
and he has to share them.

897
01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:36.820
So it was quite remarkable.

898
01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:45.140
And for that, I was always amazed by him because he was not afraid of anything.

899
01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:47.380
He was not afraid of catching.

900
01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:48.580
He just wanted to give.

901
01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:57.220
And as Shimataji said, if you give with love, you will never get affected by anything.

902
01:10:57.860 --> 01:10:59.860
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

903
01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:01.160
Yeah.

904
01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:08.020
So I think we just conclude tonight.

905
01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:11.140
Can you see the videos?

906
01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:14.660
Can I show them through?

907
01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:18.900
I'm just thinking the one where Douglas says thank you for his 70th birthday.

908
01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:21.060
You want to show them now?

909
01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:21.780
I could.

910
01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:24.340
Well, if I can do, I've got them all lined up.

911
01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:31.300
Jillian, my dear, it could take a little bit of faffing around.

912
01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:34.500
I don't know if you'd like to show them at the beginning of next month.

913
01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:35.700
Would that be possible?

914
01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:38.580
And then we can organize it with you beforehand.

915
01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:40.660
Okay, yeah, that's fine.

916
01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:41.540
Yeah, lovely.

917
01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:53.300
Yeah, we just, I think we just end with, if anybody wanted to say something, but I just

918
01:11:53.300 --> 01:12:00.260
would like to say I'm really pleased that we have gathered together to remember Douglas.

919
01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:04.580
I think she would be overjoyed like this.

920
01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:07.780
And he's overjoyed.

921
01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:09.140
I feel like I want to cry.

922
01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:10.900
He would have a good laugh.

923
01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:19.620
You know, I had an email from Sia in America about this.

924
01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:24.020
And she said she'd been reading the lovely comments people made.

925
01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:30.340
But she said it would be nice if people said things like that when people are still alive.

926
01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:33.700
So it was an interesting thing.

927
01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:38.020
If we had all sent Douglas these messages before.

928
01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:40.820
I was very happy I had that.

929
01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:43.300
That's why I really wanted to talk to him.

930
01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:46.260
I am very conscious of that nowadays.

931
01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:52.100
And I really make an effort to say these things that are in my heart so that when people go,

932
01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:53.700
you Yeah, why not?

933
01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:54.260
No regrets.

934
01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:59.300
Maybe we should make a list of people that we can say nice things about.

935
01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:02.980
Stop the oldest and go down the line.
