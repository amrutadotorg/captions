00:47:49.792 --> 00:47:53.799
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:47:59.751 --> 00:48:07.000
As it is, today, a question has been put forward before Me

00:48:07.201 --> 00:48:14.527
that why our attention gets lost; in the modern times,

00:48:14.728 --> 00:48:19.300
why our attention is not towards God.

00:48:19.501 --> 00:48:21.097
And that, in modern times,

00:48:21.298 --> 00:48:28.965
why a human being has gone down in his quality of humanity.

00:48:31.032 --> 00:48:35.024
These questions point out to one single fact

00:48:35.225 --> 00:48:43.225
that our attention has been challenged by modern times.

00:48:59.122 --> 00:49:02.200
This attention has been challenged

00:49:02.567 --> 00:49:05.715
by all that we call modern today.

00:49:08.277 --> 00:49:12.165
I do not say that we have to be primitive people.

00:49:12.366 --> 00:49:21.445
In this great country of ours, India, which was Bharatvarsh,

00:49:21.654 --> 00:49:24.810
we had such a great quality of humanity,

00:49:25.029 --> 00:49:31.771
such a great quality of administration,

00:49:32.052 --> 00:49:39.625
quality of kings, queens; all that was not a myth.

00:49:39.826 --> 00:49:45.445
It was a fact that we had Rama, Krishna

00:49:45.646 --> 00:49:52.630
the benevolent king and a great diplomat of the divine force.

00:49:52.831 --> 00:49:58.818
But today we find all these things sound like mythical

00:49:59.019 --> 00:50:04.355
because at what level we are, we see that as the truth,

00:50:04.556 --> 00:50:08.230
as the reality - but it is not.

00:50:08.988 --> 00:50:13.335
All this is created by human beings.

00:50:13.809 --> 00:50:18.440
How this is created, and why it has happened,

00:50:18.641 --> 00:50:22.039
I would like to explain to you.

00:50:23.587 --> 00:50:29.927
When our attention was created before, in a way

00:50:30.128 --> 00:50:36.182
that we were living with very few things in this country,

00:50:39.149 --> 00:50:46.147
everyone knew that you have to have your self-realization.

00:50:46.348 --> 00:50:48.981
Nobody bothered their heads about

00:50:49.184 --> 00:50:53.701
how much wealth you are going to acquire,
how many things we are going to have,

00:50:53.902 --> 00:50:58.202
except for the kings who acquired wealth

00:50:58.403 --> 00:51:02.369
for the betterment of the society and also

00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:08.257
who acquired the power for the protection of the society.

00:51:09.865 --> 00:51:14.410
Then we became slaves of two cultures

00:51:14.611 --> 00:51:19.712
One the Islamic, another the British culture,

00:51:19.913 --> 00:51:21.313
the English culture.

00:51:22.257 --> 00:51:24.038
And I think the real downfall came

00:51:24.257 --> 00:51:27.186
when this English culture came upon us.

00:51:27.429 --> 00:51:30.803
Because, though they were Muslims they believed in God.

00:51:30.975 --> 00:51:32.412
Whatever wrong they did,

00:51:32.741 --> 00:51:36.116
they did it in the name of God and they believed it.

00:51:36.317 --> 00:51:39.720
But the attention was not, still, in acquiring things.

00:51:39.921 --> 00:51:42.592
We say that Aurangazeb was a very bad king, no doubt.

00:51:42.793 --> 00:51:46.386
He killed so many Hindus because he believed

00:51:46.582 --> 00:51:49.201
that Islam is the only religion.

00:51:49.402 --> 00:51:51.370
That was his stupidity I should say.

00:51:51.571 --> 00:51:54.242
He was ignorant; he was so violent.

00:51:54.454 --> 00:52:00.276
But he himself was an extremely frugal person.

00:52:00.477 --> 00:52:02.442
He used to make his own caps,

00:52:02.643 --> 00:52:04.775
sell them in the market and live on that.

00:52:04.976 --> 00:52:10.775
And he would not touch any money of the public.

00:52:11.704 --> 00:52:15.453
But then the English, when they started ruling in this country,

00:52:15.712 --> 00:52:18.292
this language English came upon us

00:52:18.493 --> 00:52:22.837
as not a blessing but a curse, I think.

00:52:23.038 --> 00:52:29.335
Because the whole literature is full with ideas

00:52:29.536 --> 00:52:33.965
which are contrary to the culture of God,

00:52:34.166 --> 00:52:37.390
contrary to the culture of Christ.

00:52:37.591 --> 00:52:40.940
They believed that Christ was born in England.

00:52:41.141 --> 00:52:44.751
Many Christians still believe that you become a sahab

00:52:44.952 --> 00:52:46.891
when you become Christians.

00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:52.767
This culture of the English which was forced on us,

00:52:52.968 --> 00:52:55.070
this language which was forced on us,

00:52:55.304 --> 00:53:01.455
gave us a absolutely a different direction

00:53:01.656 --> 00:53:04.437
which we should not have accepted.

00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:08.765
But as it is, we were three hundred years already in the slavery,

00:53:08.984 --> 00:53:12.617
people had to accept it blindfolded.

00:53:13.672 --> 00:53:16.221
Shri Krishna has clearly said

00:53:16.422 --> 00:53:21.029
that the awareness grows downward

00:53:21.279 --> 00:53:27.406
while the roots are in the brain of a person;

00:53:27.607 --> 00:53:33.085
and the awareness, which is growing downwards,

00:53:33.286 --> 00:53:39.050
forms the tree. And this western culture is the one,

00:53:39.251 --> 00:53:43.368
which makes you grow downwards towards materialism;

00:53:43.603 --> 00:53:47.999
whether it is communism or it is socialism or democracy

00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:49.616
that makes no difference.

00:53:49.817 --> 00:53:57.301
The whole thing is that you have to attend to the material side.

00:53:57.708 --> 00:54:03.077
So the first object of the western culture

00:54:03.278 --> 00:54:08.449
or the western science was, first to capture the matter,

00:54:08.676 --> 00:54:10.809
the five elements in such a way

00:54:11.036 --> 00:54:13.636
that it can be used for the comfort of human beings,

00:54:13.837 --> 00:54:18.410
for the physical comfort of human beings.

00:54:18.931 --> 00:54:22.941
But as the culture is just to move forward

00:54:23.142 --> 00:54:25.845
without any control over yourself,

00:54:26.046 --> 00:54:29.131
like a kite flying in the air

00:54:29.358 --> 00:54:34.603
without having any control of a finger on it,

00:54:34.804 --> 00:54:38.731
the whole thing drifted into various

00:54:38.932 --> 00:54:46.350
directions and various fields, where it got lost.

00:54:46.617 --> 00:54:52.918
When we pay attention to something, if the attention is pure,

00:54:53.127 --> 00:55:00.435
it will purify the matter and will come back to us as a pure attention.

00:55:00.677 --> 00:55:03.661
But when the attention is filled with these ideas

00:55:03.857 --> 00:55:08.634
that you have to use all the matter for your comfort,

00:55:08.835 --> 00:55:11.272
then it gets lost in the matter.

00:55:11.473 --> 00:55:15.194
It gets involved in the matter. It gets spoilt in the matter,

00:55:15.452 --> 00:55:21.309
and then what comes back to us is the thought, “How to possess it”.

00:55:22.209 --> 00:55:27.086
To possess the matter, to use the matter,

00:55:27.287 --> 00:55:31.223
to sit on top of the matter was the first mistake.

00:55:31.424 --> 00:55:34.746
Matter is your slave, in any case.

00:55:34.947 --> 00:55:39.472
In any case it is your slave, and this you would have got it

00:55:39.673 --> 00:55:42.064
without paying so much attention to it.

00:55:42.306 --> 00:55:46.324
To think that science was discovered by scientists is egoistical.

00:55:46.525 --> 00:55:48.438
Its only your ego, says that.

00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:51.230
You cannot discover anything unless and until

00:55:51.431 --> 00:55:53.774
the God’s grace is upon you.

00:55:54.189 --> 00:55:56.789
It’s the God’s grace that brings forth

00:55:57.922 --> 00:56:02.186
the exposition of His powers.

00:56:02.913 --> 00:56:06.572
Even a person like Einstein has said that.

00:56:06.773 --> 00:56:11.617
Even the person like Newton has said that.

00:56:11.828 --> 00:56:16.735
Einstein has clearly said that “I was fed up and I was tired;

00:56:16.936 --> 00:56:20.052
I couldn’t find the theory of relativity;

00:56:20.272 --> 00:56:25.188
I was just resting in my garden playing with soap bubbles,

00:56:25.389 --> 00:56:28.372
and from somewhere unknown

00:56:28.629 --> 00:56:32.474
the theory of relativity dawned upon me”.

00:56:34.052 --> 00:56:36.921
But we Indians living, three hundred years

00:56:37.156 --> 00:56:40.775
in the slavish mentality, accepted it blindfolded

00:56:40.976 --> 00:56:44.464
without knowing how much knowledge and science we had.

00:56:44.665 --> 00:56:46.464
We had aeroplanes in our country.

00:56:46.678 --> 00:56:48.659
We had pilotless bombs in our country.

00:56:48.878 --> 00:56:51.745
We had all kinds of things in our country.

00:56:53.003 --> 00:57:00.008
But, why did we accept this without going into the roots

00:57:00.209 --> 00:57:03.914
to find out how did we have these things?

00:57:04.115 --> 00:57:07.316
We started doubting all that was the past in India,

00:57:07.517 --> 00:57:09.556
and we would not go into the past of it

00:57:09.757 --> 00:57:14.624
but we started moving downward with this western culture.

00:57:15.757 --> 00:57:18.525
And that’s the downfall of our country.

00:57:18.726 --> 00:57:21.579
That has brought all this nonsense here.

00:57:22.508 --> 00:57:26.035
When money becomes everything, the money orientation,

00:57:26.243 --> 00:57:27.782
the economics of it.

00:57:29.149 --> 00:57:32.809
This was the country of philosophers, of the seers,

00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:36.749
of the saints, where now today economics is dominating

00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:39.748
without understanding that you cannot put this western

00:57:39.949 --> 00:57:43.682
economics in this country at all, we cannot work it out.

00:57:44.979 --> 00:57:47.872
This is a country of generosity.

00:57:48.073 --> 00:57:50.574
People love to serve you, people love to do;

00:57:50.775 --> 00:57:53.524
even today they like to do something for you.

00:57:53.725 --> 00:57:57.004
Go to a village, even if they may not have anything with them,

00:57:57.205 --> 00:57:59.231
they’ll bring some milk; make you sit there.

00:57:59.432 --> 00:58:02.064
“Please have some milk. You have come from foreign countries,

00:58:02.291 --> 00:58:05.424
please have it.” But in the western countries:

00:58:05.643 --> 00:58:08.119
you may give them any amount of things,

00:58:08.330 --> 00:58:10.978
they won’t even return one present to you.

00:58:11.212 --> 00:58:13.046
Shamelessly they’ll take everything thinking

00:58:13.247 --> 00:58:15.207
that they are the ones who should have it.

00:58:16.341 --> 00:58:18.444
They have no subtleties.

00:58:18.645 --> 00:58:22.647
They have no subtleties to understand generosity, they cannot.

00:58:22.804 --> 00:58:26.204
They think we do it because we are slavish people.

00:58:27.085 --> 00:58:31.009
Even I was surprised when the some villagers told Me

00:58:31.210 --> 00:58:35.623
that even the animals coming from the West are stupid.

00:58:37.084 --> 00:58:41.709
I said, “how?” He said, “Now take a hen from India

00:58:41.912 --> 00:58:47.478
and take a leghorn or rooster from western countries.

00:58:47.679 --> 00:58:52.186
If there is an attack on the little chicks,

00:58:52.897 --> 00:58:55.919
the mother will start shouting or doing something,

00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:59.619
screaming or doing something to call all her children

00:58:59.839 --> 00:59:02.284
under her wings - if it’s an Indian hen.

00:59:02.542 --> 00:59:03.958
But if it’s an English hen, she wouldn’t mind.

00:59:04.159 --> 00:59:06.143
She would look at everything very peacefully,

00:59:06.323 --> 00:59:12.255
stithapragya, not bothered.” Then he said,

00:59:12.456 --> 00:59:14.846
“Most surprising thing is that our bullocks,

00:59:15.047 --> 00:59:18.924
if you tell them go this way, that way, they understand.

00:59:19.125 --> 00:59:22.344
But if you tell a western bullock,

00:59:22.545 --> 00:59:25.310
he walks straight into the car, into the trucks;

00:59:25.483 --> 00:59:29.329
he doesn’t know where he is walking. He has no idea.

00:59:29.530 --> 00:59:30.829
You cannot leave them alone.

00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:32.061
And if you tell them walk this way,

00:59:32.262 --> 00:59:34.662
they will walk the other way round.”

00:59:34.981 --> 00:59:37.280
So what is in this culture?

00:59:37.481 --> 00:59:46.360
What is in this whole upbringing that makes you so gross?

00:59:46.719 --> 00:59:51.013
The attention is on the matter and not on the spirit.

00:59:51.248 --> 00:59:56.826
All the time the matter is trying to overpower the spirit.

00:59:57.647 --> 01:00:01.833
Supposing there is a tree that falls off, it dies,

01:00:02.034 --> 01:00:05.940
then you make a chair out of it. It’s a dead from the dead.

01:00:06.143 --> 01:00:09.950
Now you sit on the chair and you become a slave of the chair.

01:00:10.151 --> 01:00:12.676
You cannot sit on the ground.

01:00:12.877 --> 01:00:15.447
Then you have to carry chairs with you.

01:00:16.932 --> 01:00:19.066
If you start moving in a car,

01:00:19.267 --> 01:00:24.754
you become so useless that you cannot walk with your legs.

01:00:25.817 --> 01:00:28.417
Tomorrow you start having calculators…

01:00:28.676 --> 01:00:30.030
you’ll be surprised, I live in London

01:00:30.231 --> 01:00:32.018
I am amazed at the people.

01:00:32.214 --> 01:00:36.414
Even if they have to do two plus two they want their tambaaku.

01:00:37.667 --> 01:00:39.112
They want to calculate it.

01:00:39.323 --> 01:00:40.951
For two plus two they cannot do it,

01:00:41.152 --> 01:00:44.066
they have no brains left because computers have come.

01:00:44.324 --> 01:00:46.975
So as a result of this machinery,

01:00:47.176 --> 01:00:51.451
the machines that have created… We say the “machine age”

01:00:51.655 --> 01:00:55.930
what an age it is - and the age of development.

01:00:56.131 --> 01:01:00.983
Without any control if the machines have

01:01:02.187 --> 01:01:06.189
gone up to this point, it is time that we understand

01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:09.218
we should not go too much towards it,

01:01:09.438 --> 01:01:12.038
that we become slaves of this machine.

01:01:12.297 --> 01:01:14.830
The machine is like a devil.

01:01:15.031 --> 01:01:20.993
It requires, like a devil, all the time to eat something.

01:01:21.236 --> 01:01:26.689
Like, you… in England it’s impossible to get fresh food.

01:01:26.890 --> 01:01:28.960
You have to go to the main market to get it.

01:01:29.163 --> 01:01:32.025
But in America, is even worse

01:01:32.233 --> 01:01:35.908
and in most of the countries they have everything packed,

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:39.611
everything in a plastic bag, everything measured.

01:01:39.812 --> 01:01:43.491
You go to the shop, you get this, this, this, this… nothing fresh.

01:01:43.692 --> 01:01:47.527
There’s no taste in the food. Now they are using chemicals.

01:01:47.747 --> 01:01:50.879
They put chemicals in the body of the animals, which they eat;

01:01:51.061 --> 01:01:53.219
put chemicals in the foods that they eat;

01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:57.873
put chemicals because the machine must have a quantity.

01:01:58.124 --> 01:02:00.399
To have the quantity they have to do all this.

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:02.608
So what you are taking is all this chemicals.

01:02:02.809 --> 01:02:03.746
As a result of that,

01:02:03.918 --> 01:02:08.155
what you are developing is nothing else but your destruction

01:02:08.356 --> 01:02:12.605
So all this attention outside, into the matter,

01:02:12.809 --> 01:02:16.426
builds up your destructions gradually.

01:02:17.512 --> 01:02:21.157
The attention gets fragmented.

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:22.855
For example, you are talking to someone…

01:02:23.056 --> 01:02:25.292
this is a very modern stuff, I have seen many.

01:02:25.493 --> 01:02:29.081
You are talking to someone and this person is looking somewhere else.

01:02:29.290 --> 01:02:30.195
“Where are you looking?”

01:02:30.375 --> 01:02:36.198
“Oh, I was looking at that picture or something.

01:02:36.399 --> 01:02:37.627
I think I should buy that.”

01:02:37.828 --> 01:02:41.515
But I am talking to you here - doesn’t go into the head. Nothing.

01:02:41.735 --> 01:02:44.586
He is looking at something, or at some woman,

01:02:44.766 --> 01:02:48.699
or at some man - which is joyless pursuit.

01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:54.009
We have nothing to do with it and there is no alertness,

01:02:54.267 --> 01:02:57.477
which picks up things at the right moment.

01:02:57.678 --> 01:02:59.704
Then another thing a gentleman told Me,

01:02:59.905 --> 01:03:01.818
whose four children are in an English school

01:03:02.006 --> 01:03:04.339
and one child in an Indian school.

01:03:04.506 --> 01:03:08.297
He says these four children don’t talk much.

01:03:08.498 --> 01:03:11.688
They think no end of themselves and they don’t know.

01:03:11.889 --> 01:03:17.633
You ask them how many roads there are to your house?

01:03:17.834 --> 01:03:19.029
They wouldn’t know.

01:03:19.212 --> 01:03:24.011
They just go like a blinkers of a horse around their heads.

01:03:24.212 --> 01:03:26.490
They walk like that. They don’t know anything.

01:03:26.691 --> 01:03:28.294
They don’t read newspapers;

01:03:28.495 --> 01:03:30.162
they have no ideas as to what things we have.

01:03:30.363 --> 01:03:34.089
The youngest child, who is brought up in an Indian way

01:03:34.262 --> 01:03:37.105
and in an Indian school, has got a little parrot,

01:03:37.293 --> 01:03:41.490
has got a little doggy, has… looks after all the cows.

01:03:41.691 --> 01:03:47.060
He gives all the news about all the animals in the house.

01:03:47.261 --> 01:03:49.245
He gives all the news about the relations.

01:03:49.449 --> 01:03:52.146
He knows who are the relations, who are suffering,

01:03:52.347 --> 01:03:55.511
what is the problem. What in the kitchen is needed?

01:03:55.712 --> 01:03:58.443
He is so alert, his attention is so alert

01:03:58.644 --> 01:04:00.456
because it is not fragmented.

01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:05.357
Now with any convenience,

01:04:05.558 --> 01:04:08.550
we want to put our children into English schools.

01:04:08.784 --> 01:04:11.427
I tell you, you’ll have it.

01:04:11.628 --> 01:04:13.703
If they don’t beat you when they grow up,

01:04:13.904 --> 01:04:15.930
you shouldn’t be surprised. I’ve seen

01:04:16.131 --> 01:04:18.755
western children beat their parents.

01:04:20.731 --> 01:04:21.758
They answer them back.

01:04:21.959 --> 01:04:25.204
It was a day when the children of a good family

01:04:25.405 --> 01:04:30.334
would always address their parents as sir or mother as a madam.

01:04:30.569 --> 01:04:34.332
But today, I have seen them answering them back

01:04:34.533 --> 01:04:36.501
saying all kinds of funny things

01:04:36.721 --> 01:04:38.736
and knowing all the filth of the world,

01:04:38.877 --> 01:04:40.871
all the filth of the world.

01:04:41.072 --> 01:04:43.909
They know so much of filth that you are shocked;

01:04:44.144 --> 01:04:45.912
you don’t know that.

01:04:46.113 --> 01:04:49.037
And the whole attitude of all their medias,

01:04:49.238 --> 01:04:52.120
or ours also I should say, in a way,

01:04:52.426 --> 01:04:54.604
is to create that attitude,

01:04:54.805 --> 01:04:57.377
to put our children into that filth all the time,

01:04:57.578 --> 01:04:59.273
take them to that filth.

01:05:00.578 --> 01:05:03.672
Our people also - I see in the television, here also

01:05:03.901 --> 01:05:07.145
they show all these horribly nude

01:05:07.346 --> 01:05:08.977
funny women in the advertisement.

01:05:09.177 --> 01:05:12.523
Because these advertisements, and the medias also,

01:05:12.724 --> 01:05:16.231
work out your attention onto the gross.

01:05:16.443 --> 01:05:19.726
They play on your weaknesses.

01:05:19.927 --> 01:05:23.425
That’s how they make you weak, and when you become weak,

01:05:23.621 --> 01:05:25.354
weak, they become very powerful.

01:05:25.542 --> 01:05:29.142
When the media is so powerful, you can’t do anything.

01:05:29.386 --> 01:05:34.628
There is no purity in their hearts to do benevolence,

01:05:34.829 --> 01:05:37.204
to do good to the people - as we call janahith.

01:05:37.423 --> 01:05:41.527
That’s not in their mind at all. Somehow to make money.

01:05:41.728 --> 01:05:43.928
What’s the harm in making money?

01:05:44.539 --> 01:05:47.713
It’s surprising how people are compromising

01:05:47.914 --> 01:05:51.695
for the sake of money. Money doesn’t give you joy.

01:05:51.914 --> 01:05:54.312
I have to tell you it cannot give you joy.

01:05:54.524 --> 01:05:56.057
Don’t run after money.

01:05:56.297 --> 01:06:00.479
Have a integrated attitude towards money.

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:03.156
Money is the blessing of the Lakshmi,

01:06:03.359 --> 01:06:06.986
and the Lakshmi is a very beautiful woman

01:06:07.187 --> 01:06:13.546
who has got a very motherly attitude. She is the Mother.

01:06:13.797 --> 01:06:18.507
A man who has money has to have motherly attitude.

01:06:19.039 --> 01:06:22.492
She has got two lotuses in Her hands;

01:06:22.693 --> 01:06:24.990
pink shows that She is love.

01:06:25.201 --> 01:06:28.164
She expresses Her love in two of Her hands

01:06:28.365 --> 01:06:31.052
which also means a lotus which is pink,

01:06:31.295 --> 01:06:39.109
is even entertaining a thorny bhavraa, we call it

01:06:39.310 --> 01:06:43.320
the black big beetle, which has got thorns

01:06:43.521 --> 01:06:49.430
on its soft petals and gives it a place of rest.

01:06:49.693 --> 01:06:52.245
How many of these rich people in this country,

01:06:52.446 --> 01:06:56.746
and specially abroad, would entertain such an idea

01:06:56.981 --> 01:07:00.692
of having a place for a ashrayaa,

01:07:00.893 --> 01:07:05.996
for a support for the persons who are like a bhavraa.

01:07:09.466 --> 01:07:16.648
Then, the other hand, which is like this, has to be daan.

01:07:16.849 --> 01:07:19.294
You have to give, if you have money you must give.

01:07:19.466 --> 01:07:21.903
How many of them know where to give money?

01:07:22.104 --> 01:07:23.799
They’ll give money to places

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.463
where people will cheat them - like Rajneesh.

01:07:28.831 --> 01:07:31.841
They’ll not give money to the poor.

01:07:32.042 --> 01:07:35.870
They’ll not develop anything for the poor in a proper way.

01:07:36.104 --> 01:07:38.122
The other day, I was surprised, I went to Poona.

01:07:38.323 --> 01:07:41.833
We have there a very good thing system started

01:07:42.041 --> 01:07:45.510
of called as JanaShanti where people give food

01:07:45.711 --> 01:07:48.781
for two rupees, very good food for one, one meal,

01:07:48.993 --> 01:07:52.422
very very good food, excellent food they give and sufficient

01:07:52.651 --> 01:07:57.057
for two rupees. And they said all the, President downward,

01:07:57.258 --> 01:08:00.086
people came here; we had to spend money on their reception.

01:08:00.294 --> 01:08:01.966
We gave them this that, garland,

01:08:02.162 --> 01:08:05.295
this that and everybody gave big big lectures.

01:08:06.467 --> 01:08:10.716
And nobody is willing to even give them a place on rent.

01:08:10.925 --> 01:08:12.143
No one wants them there

01:08:12.378 --> 01:08:15.034
because they think you will go into competition

01:08:15.262 --> 01:08:18.432
with others who are making profits and will not get votes.

01:08:18.651 --> 01:08:22.080
So the whole system is so funny

01:08:22.281 --> 01:08:24.095
that you end up at a point that

01:08:24.296 --> 01:08:26.327
they want to give money because they want to have votes.

01:08:26.538 --> 01:08:30.116
They want to win the election because they want to make money.

01:08:30.366 --> 01:08:33.211
I mean, I came to this country and everybody is saying,

01:08:33.412 --> 01:08:36.122
“What’s the matter, why can’t we get the plot?”

01:08:36.326 --> 01:08:38.240
Because the person wants to eat the money;

01:08:38.428 --> 01:08:41.297
here everybody eats the money,

01:08:41.498 --> 01:08:43.999
eating the money, paishe khaato.

01:08:44.219 --> 01:08:46.695
Te paishe khata, te paishe khata, te paishe khata.

01:08:46.953 --> 01:08:50.796
Say, don’t they eat their food, or why are they eating money?

01:08:50.984 --> 01:08:53.551
This is the trouble of this country has come because money

01:08:53.752 --> 01:08:56.829
has become the most important thing for them.

01:08:57.111 --> 01:09:01.402
Nothing that they think that this body, this being,

01:09:01.603 --> 01:09:05.723
this is a collective being. This is the samoohik being.

01:09:05.950 --> 01:09:09.022
It cannot be happy with this kind of a harm

01:09:09.223 --> 01:09:10.637
we are doing to our society.

01:09:10.838 --> 01:09:13.053
All those who do things like this,

01:09:13.254 --> 01:09:16.309
their seven generations will be cursed by God.

01:09:16.854 --> 01:09:17.776
You must understand:

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:21.080
those who make money at the cost of the poor people,

01:09:21.284 --> 01:09:23.217
they will be cursed forever.

01:09:23.448 --> 01:09:26.837
And one should not join such people,

01:09:27.038 --> 01:09:28.888
even if you have to suffer.

01:09:29.130 --> 01:09:33.190
I know it’s very hard time, people cannot afford

01:09:33.391 --> 01:09:37.279
to live with the earnings they have. But still, if you decide,

01:09:37.523 --> 01:09:41.295
you can live with the satisfaction that you have done right.

01:09:41.506 --> 01:09:44.802
When My father was…

01:09:47.476 --> 01:09:50.608
and My mother, both were in jail so many times.

01:09:50.819 --> 01:09:51.585
We were eleven children.

01:09:51.786 --> 01:09:54.262
We were very rich people living in huts.

01:09:54.575 --> 01:09:57.772
And we didn’t have food for days together sometimes.

01:09:57.973 --> 01:10:00.043
And we have… were used to very rich life.

01:10:00.254 --> 01:10:03.793
They sacrificed everything for the country’s freedom.

01:10:03.996 --> 01:10:06.496
Where are such people now? You can’t think of them.

01:10:06.715 --> 01:10:07.684
They are legendary people.

01:10:07.885 --> 01:10:11.739
Nobody wants to sacrifice anything whatsoever.

01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:13.778
And this is the movement;

01:10:13.979 --> 01:10:17.596
this is a new movement of swatantra.

01:10:17.797 --> 01:10:21.369
Swaatantrya is not yet complete; you can see it clearly.

01:10:21.570 --> 01:10:23.961
It is not. Your freedom is not complete.

01:10:24.195 --> 01:10:25.961
If your freedom has to be complete,

01:10:26.196 --> 01:10:28.846
you must get your swatantra;

01:10:29.047 --> 01:10:33.921
you must know the technique of your swa, of your spirit.

01:10:34.172 --> 01:10:36.828
Unless and until you get this full freedom,

01:10:37.039 --> 01:10:40.015
you are not free people. You are slaves of money.

01:10:40.216 --> 01:10:44.970
You are slaves of powers. You are slaves of showing off.

01:10:45.171 --> 01:10:50.033
You are slaves of everything, to Me. All kinds of bad habits.

01:10:50.234 --> 01:10:53.851
I’ve never known so many drunkards that we find these days.

01:10:54.171 --> 01:10:57.655
So we have become greater slaves of all the bad habits,

01:10:57.867 --> 01:11:02.326
all the bad doings. And there is nothing

01:11:02.527 --> 01:11:07.660
that a person in a big position can think of not doing.

01:11:09.644 --> 01:11:10.811
Why it has happened to us?

01:11:11.012 --> 01:11:16.537
Why have we all collapsed into such insipid useless people?

01:11:16.738 --> 01:11:19.659
What has happened to our countrymen? Is this:

01:11:19.855 --> 01:11:21.628
that they have not realized

01:11:21.847 --> 01:11:28.607
that the greatest thing is in the brain. Is the roots,

01:11:28.808 --> 01:11:33.277
and these roots are in this country, in this Maharastra.

01:11:33.551 --> 01:11:38.703
These roots are here. The Kundalini has to only enlighten these roots,

01:11:38.907 --> 01:11:42.446
and we never bothered about it. We never cared for it.

01:11:42.688 --> 01:11:46.421
We are all the time worried as to how to get more money.

01:11:46.714 --> 01:11:48.807
So the people who are highly paid

01:11:49.034 --> 01:11:52.486
or who are at a higher position with less pay, also maybe,

01:11:52.784 --> 01:11:55.317
they are making money by eating that.

01:11:55.589 --> 01:11:57.443
And the others are a sort of people

01:11:57.644 --> 01:12:00.604
who are going on strike for everything. For what?

01:12:00.769 --> 01:12:02.904
For money, again for money.

01:12:03.105 --> 01:12:06.368
This Bombay is half finished because of strikes.

01:12:06.569 --> 01:12:09.439
What for strikes? I asked them. You are a drunkard?

01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:12.124
Yes. You drink? All right. And you smoke? Yes.

01:12:12.335 --> 01:12:14.673
You eat tambaaku? Yes. You eat paan.

01:12:14.874 --> 01:12:16.975
That means you have money.

01:12:17.999 --> 01:12:19.772
Otherwise how can you afford all these things?

01:12:20.023 --> 01:12:22.756
When you ask for more money in a strike,

01:12:22.992 --> 01:12:25.320
better find out what sort of a man he is.

01:12:25.554 --> 01:12:26.816
If he can drink, afford to drink,

01:12:27.017 --> 01:12:29.610
then you need not give him any money to drink more.

01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:32.212
Any mother who sees her son is drinking,

01:12:32.413 --> 01:12:33.517
will never give him any money

01:12:33.728 --> 01:12:35.209
because he will be drinking with that money.

01:12:35.410 --> 01:12:39.092
What else is he going to do? What good is he going to do with that?

01:12:39.293 --> 01:12:41.365
So what happens is that this attention,

01:12:41.566 --> 01:12:44.019
when it starts moving towards money,

01:12:44.223 --> 01:12:47.275
we become so blind that we do not see why,

01:12:47.476 --> 01:12:53.666
why are we asking for money. What is the need for money?

01:12:53.867 --> 01:12:55.550
I am not for these capitalists at all.

01:12:55.751 --> 01:12:57.595
I know how horrid they are.

01:12:57.796 --> 01:13:01.897
But what I’m saying that why break the machinery like this.

01:13:02.155 --> 01:13:03.822
Now whatever you may do,

01:13:04.087 --> 01:13:06.653
whatever you may tell them that finish this striking

01:13:06.854 --> 01:13:10.307
and enjoy yourself now, for the God sake.

01:13:10.581 --> 01:13:14.514
We have really poor people in the villages, not in Bombay.

01:13:14.838 --> 01:13:16.313
In Bombay we don’t have poor people.

01:13:16.514 --> 01:13:18.881
They can go to cinema; they can do all kinds of things.

01:13:19.147 --> 01:13:22.579
How can they be poor? But they have time.

01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:24.553
They have more time. That’s why they get…

01:13:24.754 --> 01:13:25.647
enter into such things.

01:13:25.848 --> 01:13:29.920
And they are going to finish this Mumbai of yours

01:13:30.121 --> 01:13:32.223
very soon if you allow these people to go on strike.

01:13:32.423 --> 01:13:34.752
It’s stupidity, absolute stupidity

01:13:34.986 --> 01:13:39.119
and it come from the western people - it’s not from Gandhiji.

01:13:39.712 --> 01:13:43.245
Gandhiji didn’t tell you to fight for money. Did he?

01:13:43.477 --> 01:13:46.077
He asked you to fight for swaatantrya.

01:13:46.571 --> 01:13:47.977
And today if he was living,

01:13:48.219 --> 01:13:51.477
he would have talked about Sahaja Yoga, I am sure of that.

01:13:51.782 --> 01:13:54.946
But the problem that exists with us is that

01:13:55.147 --> 01:14:00.037
we don’t want to see that this machinery is now shaking.

01:14:00.366 --> 01:14:02.131
We have to have another system,

01:14:02.295 --> 01:14:06.294
a parallel system that will crush this stupid machinery,

01:14:06.495 --> 01:14:10.424
which is taking us downward and downward and downward.

01:14:11.346 --> 01:14:13.658
A girl must have ten types of sarees,

01:14:13.878 --> 01:14:16.820
ten types of clothes she must wear, like a Kashmiri girl;

01:14:17.021 --> 01:14:18.312
she must wear like a Punjabi girl;

01:14:18.513 --> 01:14:20.351
she must wear like an English girl.

01:14:20.552 --> 01:14:22.929
What is the need? I mean, we used to have…

01:14:23.138 --> 01:14:24.859
we are rich people, I should… very rich,

01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:26.145
we used to have only two sarees.

01:14:26.349 --> 01:14:28.156
And one for - thevni as they call it -

01:14:28.357 --> 01:14:31.431
one for some special occasions. And we lived well,

01:14:31.632 --> 01:14:34.796
we educated well where attention was learning

01:14:35.018 --> 01:14:37.655
and attention was towards God.

01:14:39.624 --> 01:14:42.957
But the attention, when it gets lost it fritters away.

01:14:43.278 --> 01:14:44.845
It gets lost. It gets fragmented.

01:14:45.046 --> 01:14:47.436
There’s no continuity in it. It fritters away

01:14:47.624 --> 01:14:50.079
and a person becomes a superficial person,

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:54.178
extremely superficial. He cannot go deep.

01:14:54.452 --> 01:14:59.033
How can he feel his spirit? The superficiality makes you,

01:14:59.234 --> 01:15:04.731
absolutely, a person who has sort of a crust

01:15:04.934 --> 01:15:10.718
and nothing inside, absolutely what we call the hollowness,

01:15:10.919 --> 01:15:15.419
kokhlapan, completely hollow. If you just break that man,

01:15:15.638 --> 01:15:17.906
you find out he is not a man of character.

01:15:18.107 --> 01:15:20.090
He is not a man to be dependant upon.

01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:22.395
He is not a man who talks good of others.

01:15:22.607 --> 01:15:26.161
He will try to pull you down. This is what happens to your attention

01:15:26.386 --> 01:15:33.522
and you become extremely, extremely low-level human being.

01:15:33.723 --> 01:15:37.082
You’ll be surprised I went to four villages before coming here

01:15:37.418 --> 01:15:42.372
and the people who were there were five times more than Bombay people.

01:15:42.725 --> 01:15:44.905
They came, they didn’t have cars, nothing;

01:15:45.163 --> 01:15:50.118
they didn’t have buses. They came walking. They came on bullock carts.

01:15:50.319 --> 01:15:54.793
And such a big crowd and all of them got realization

01:15:54.994 --> 01:15:58.594
because, thank God, they don’t know English language.

01:15:59.222 --> 01:16:04.462
And these nonsensical ideas that we have got from the western culture.

01:16:04.947 --> 01:16:08.743
We are not to compete with them. They have to compete with us.

01:16:09.056 --> 01:16:11.189
They have nothing to offer you.

01:16:11.962 --> 01:16:15.033
You have to stick onto your ideal. But instead of that,

01:16:15.249 --> 01:16:16.702
we have learnt all the bad things,

01:16:16.913 --> 01:16:19.506
and all the bad traditions like taking dowry,

01:16:19.741 --> 01:16:23.268
torturing our women and doing all these things,

01:16:23.503 --> 01:16:27.416
which do not at all look civil.

01:16:28.706 --> 01:16:31.620
In that we are not modern. In that we are not modern;

01:16:31.815 --> 01:16:35.317
in that we are very very primitive.

01:16:35.518 --> 01:16:38.949
But it was never so before. Nobody used to torture wives.

01:16:39.121 --> 01:16:42.160
We never knew there was a dowry system in India.

01:16:42.402 --> 01:16:43.342
Nobody knew it.

01:16:43.543 --> 01:16:45.902
It is absolutely something we cannot understand

01:16:46.144 --> 01:16:49.699
from where it came, and I discovered it came from the English only.

01:16:49.988 --> 01:16:53.461
Because they said we should be very,

01:16:53.662 --> 01:16:57.391
very balanced about our children.

01:16:57.592 --> 01:17:01.180
And we should not give only the money to the boy.

01:17:01.381 --> 01:17:03.873
They’ll just quarrel but we should give it to the girl also.

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:07.568
Because, you see, the whole inheritance will go to the boys,

01:17:07.803 --> 01:17:10.208
the land will go to the boys, you must give some money.

01:17:10.409 --> 01:17:13.619
That was sensible but we have gone to the extremes now,

01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:16.518
and all these problems are coming before us,

01:17:16.719 --> 01:17:19.661
which we call as social problems.

01:17:19.862 --> 01:17:21.224
Then we have problems,

01:17:21.425 --> 01:17:25.908
which we call as emotional problems out of family problems.

01:17:26.979 --> 01:17:29.002
Now if you want to follow them

01:17:29.203 --> 01:17:30.788
then I would like to give you the picture

01:17:30.984 --> 01:17:32.851
how their family lives are.

01:17:33.031 --> 01:17:36.275
So that you’ll understand that you just stop

01:17:36.476 --> 01:17:39.512
having all those ideas into your heads.

01:17:39.762 --> 01:17:43.163
The family picture is like this:

01:17:43.364 --> 01:17:48.429
That a husband and wife get married, so called.

01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:53.626
Within say a year or so, they are divorced.

01:17:53.827 --> 01:17:59.331
Then in one lifetime they’ll have eight husbands and eight wives, at least.

01:18:00.214 --> 01:18:03.386
Then they all land up in the orphanage in old age.

01:18:03.597 --> 01:18:05.440
The children are in the orphanage.

01:18:05.684 --> 01:18:09.827
The father is in the orphanage and the mother is also in the orphanage.

01:18:10.028 --> 01:18:13.434
All the mothers, fathers, everybody ends up in orphanage.

01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:20.592
There is no love. There is no feeling in England itself,

01:18:20.793 --> 01:18:24.300
I was feeling, but it is only in London.

01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:28.343
Two children are killed by their parents.

01:18:28.544 --> 01:18:32.054
There’s no compassion. There’s no daya.

01:18:32.255 --> 01:18:33.599
There’s no karuna in them.

01:18:33.833 --> 01:18:37.007
And that’s what today happening to us also.

01:18:37.208 --> 01:18:39.005
Our children are going the same way.

01:18:39.263 --> 01:18:41.663
Our parents are going the same way.

01:18:41.912 --> 01:18:45.724
So as My mother always used to say, “lakshya kuthe?”

01:18:45.925 --> 01:18:49.221
where’s your attention? Where is your attention?

01:18:49.956 --> 01:18:52.534
So you would say that no, my attention is nowhere.

01:18:52.722 --> 01:18:55.018
Nowhere means what? Should be on God.

01:18:55.245 --> 01:18:59.520
Where is your attention? Should be on God.

01:18:59.721 --> 01:19:02.434
Devaa kade lakshya thevaa. Keep attention towards God.

01:19:02.635 --> 01:19:04.446
Where is your attention?

01:19:04.647 --> 01:19:06.611
Even when they taught music they used to say,

01:19:06.784 --> 01:19:11.653
“first think of God.” Anything they did, think of God.

01:19:11.854 --> 01:19:13.653
When you think of God,

01:19:13.854 --> 01:19:18.856
you don’t think of other nonsensical things but sensible things.

01:19:19.057 --> 01:19:21.866
And that is how our… our attention frittered away

01:19:22.067 --> 01:19:23.998
because when the attention comes out

01:19:24.199 --> 01:19:33.511
it attacks the modern, because there’s a challenge.

01:19:33.712 --> 01:19:37.543
As a result of that fight the attention breaks into fragments.

01:19:37.744 --> 01:19:39.566
There is no... Fragmentation is there.

01:19:39.767 --> 01:19:41.027
Your attention is not collected.

01:19:41.228 --> 01:19:43.033
You don’t know where you are, where you are moving.

01:19:43.234 --> 01:19:44.933
You can’t see anything; you don’t understand.

01:19:45.134 --> 01:19:46.924
You ask them one question, they don’t know.

01:19:47.125 --> 01:19:48.704
They’ve forgotten. What is your father’s name?

01:19:48.905 --> 01:19:51.678
“No, I don’t know what’s my father’s name”.

01:19:54.593 --> 01:19:57.923
This is the situation, which they are facing.

01:19:58.124 --> 01:20:03.483
You have no idea as to what hell they are living into.

01:20:03.684 --> 01:20:08.907
And if you want to take yourself and your children to that hell, follow them.

01:20:10.775 --> 01:20:13.563
But it doesn’t mean that you go to these bhajjis

01:20:13.778 --> 01:20:16.191
and give them money, or go to these horrible gurus.

01:20:16.392 --> 01:20:21.035
It doesn’t mean that either. It never means that.

01:20:21.236 --> 01:20:22.410
You avoid that nonsense

01:20:22.611 --> 01:20:25.165
because your parents were stupid to go to these gurus.

01:20:25.353 --> 01:20:27.743
These have started only hundred years back.

01:20:27.939 --> 01:20:29.298
We have never known such people.

01:20:29.501 --> 01:20:30.899
Before, these bhondoos we never knew.

01:20:31.119 --> 01:20:33.767
Hundred years back nobody talks except for Nanaka,

01:20:33.986 --> 01:20:36.283
who has said it that these bhondoos must be avoided.

01:20:36.484 --> 01:20:38.783
“Sadguru che lakshan he” and all these things

01:20:38.984 --> 01:20:43.111
have been written by Ramdaasa. But who reads Ramdaas?

01:20:43.312 --> 01:20:45.556
Because he was a Brahmin, non-Brahmins won’t read.

01:20:45.757 --> 01:20:47.913
Who will read Tukharaama? Because he was a non-Brahmin,

01:20:48.114 --> 01:20:52.978
Brahmins won’t read it. If their caste is such a big thing,

01:20:53.179 --> 01:20:56.932
that by reading something it falls off, better give it up.

01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:58.799
All these caste systems

01:20:59.034 --> 01:21:02.255
and all these are now so much settled into our heads.

01:21:02.456 --> 01:21:04.925
So much settled; it was never so before.

01:21:05.245 --> 01:21:07.615
It’s very surprising.

01:21:07.816 --> 01:21:10.682
And in the early times there was no caste system.

01:21:10.925 --> 01:21:13.412
There was a caste system according to your karmas,

01:21:13.613 --> 01:21:17.369
according to your doings, not according to where you are born.

01:21:17.577 --> 01:21:21.725
Otherwise, how could Valmiki be called a brahma rishi?

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:26.083
And how could Vyasa, who was an illegitimate child

01:21:26.284 --> 01:21:31.351
of a fisherwoman, could be called as the greatest of greatest?

01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:37.283
All these false ideas have to fall out,

01:21:37.484 --> 01:21:40.007
and for that we have to start a new system.

01:21:40.239 --> 01:21:43.502
And a new system has to come forward through the people

01:21:43.703 --> 01:21:46.213
who have achieved their yoga.

01:21:46.414 --> 01:21:48.510
Shri Krishna Himself has clearly said,

01:21:48.718 --> 01:21:51.624
“yogakshema vahamyaham” - when you get your yoga,

01:21:51.805 --> 01:21:56.065
you will get kshema. Always He has said about yogis.

01:21:56.266 --> 01:21:58.575
He has used the word yogis for that.

01:21:58.755 --> 01:22:00.528
These yogis have to come that,

01:22:00.729 --> 01:22:02.395
and as you have read in the Pasaydaan just now

01:22:02.596 --> 01:22:06.830
you have heard about it that the forests,

01:22:07.057 --> 01:22:13.778
forests of these great people who are kalpatarus,

01:22:13.979 --> 01:22:18.411
who are the givers of your desires, will be walking.

01:22:18.612 --> 01:22:21.159
These are the yogis.

01:22:21.417 --> 01:22:26.479
And the oceans of this talking nectar

01:22:26.941 --> 01:22:32.984
will be talking about God. These are the yogis.

01:22:33.185 --> 01:22:35.474
Others are all ordinary useless people,

01:22:35.675 --> 01:22:37.229
will be frittered away.

01:22:37.464 --> 01:22:40.504
Only the yogis will be respected in the kingdom of God.

01:22:40.705 --> 01:22:43.573
And we have to bring the kingdom of God on this earth.

01:22:43.784 --> 01:22:48.587
First in India, then everywhere. Here it is going to come.

01:22:48.788 --> 01:22:54.897
Now people might say Marxism, this ism, that ism.

01:22:55.741 --> 01:23:02.507
Tukaraama has said ava ghaachi samsaara sukha cha kari.

01:23:02.708 --> 01:23:05.793
He said it. Same - Marx says the same.

01:23:05.994 --> 01:23:08.212
He says that the whole world should be so…

01:23:08.408 --> 01:23:11.590
such a happy place, such a happy place

01:23:11.791 --> 01:23:15.591
that there should be no state.

01:23:15.999 --> 01:23:20.978
How? Nobody asked him how. He talks of evolution. How?

01:23:21.179 --> 01:23:23.878
How the evolution is going to take place? Ask him.

01:23:24.081 --> 01:23:25.612
Ask all these communists.

01:23:25.808 --> 01:23:28.339
They are not becoming better people. Are they?

01:23:28.558 --> 01:23:30.158
Who is becoming better?

01:23:30.425 --> 01:23:33.706
Who is getting transformed by that Isms? None of them.

01:23:33.910 --> 01:23:35.870
Somebody is a disciple of this gentleman.

01:23:36.078 --> 01:23:37.644
Somebody is a disciple of that gentleman.

01:23:37.883 --> 01:23:40.910
Somebody is following this kind of a political theory.

01:23:41.111 --> 01:23:43.853
Another following that kind of a theory. It’s a theory.

01:23:44.054 --> 01:23:47.446
In Marathi as they say, “bhola cha tsa baata bhola chi tsa kari”.

01:23:47.699 --> 01:23:48.743
Whatever theories you have,

01:23:48.944 --> 01:23:50.279
you have written down on your heads.

01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:54.220
Are you going to get transformation with that?

01:23:54.421 --> 01:23:57.358
There has to, something, happen within you.

01:23:57.553 --> 01:24:01.196
If you have to get to that point what Marx has said,

01:24:01.397 --> 01:24:03.556
what Tukaraama has said.

01:24:03.757 --> 01:24:07.853
This parivarthan, this change, this transformation has to take place

01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:11.947
and that’s only possible through the Kundalini awakening.

01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:14.431
There are people who have read about Kundalini.

01:24:14.666 --> 01:24:15.650
They come and ask Me,

01:24:15.851 --> 01:24:18.142
“Mother this Kundalini that You are talking about,

01:24:18.330 --> 01:24:20.330
people say that this Kundalini can give us madness, this that.”

01:24:22.922 --> 01:24:24.877
Even they have said that six,

01:24:25.078 --> 01:24:28.484
sixth chapter of Gynaneshwari should not be read at all

01:24:28.711 --> 01:24:30.679
7because it deals with Kundalini.

01:24:30.883 --> 01:24:32.730
Naturally - because they don’t know anything about it.

01:24:32.949 --> 01:24:34.910
So it is better not to deal with it.

01:24:35.129 --> 01:24:40.131
But Kundalini is the shuddha iccha, is the real icchaa,

01:24:40.332 --> 01:24:42.270
is the one that is going to give you

01:24:42.471 --> 01:24:45.220
that what you are born for, is going to give you.

01:24:45.424 --> 01:24:49.903
After that you do not want anything else.

01:24:50.104 --> 01:24:53.209
It’s not like the economics that you want today this,

01:24:53.410 --> 01:24:57.326
tomorrow that and it is never satiable in general.

01:24:57.527 --> 01:25:00.482
It gets completely…

01:25:00.690 --> 01:25:06.836
the thing that you want is the entire source of satisfaction.

01:25:07.037 --> 01:25:09.602
But is the movement is upward;

01:25:09.821 --> 01:25:13.367
the Kundalini doesn’t go downward towards the gravity,

01:25:13.579 --> 01:25:16.063
towards the matter.

01:25:17.149 --> 01:25:23.964
It comes up. It moves upward and pierces through this

01:25:24.165 --> 01:25:28.190
fontanelle bone area and you get your self-realization.

01:25:28.391 --> 01:25:31.167
This is what you should ask from any guru.

01:25:31.368 --> 01:25:34.258
All the rest of it is useless. How can you pay for it?

01:25:34.454 --> 01:25:37.612
Can you show rupee to that Kundalini?

01:25:37.813 --> 01:25:41.159
It’s a living process of the living evolution,

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:42.360
which has to take place.

01:25:42.548 --> 01:25:46.148
You have to achieve the epitome of your life by this.

01:25:46.337 --> 01:25:47.706
How are you going to do it?

01:25:47.907 --> 01:25:50.953
Are you going to do it by standing on your head?

01:25:51.173 --> 01:25:53.631
Any living process like a sprouting of a seed,

01:25:53.832 --> 01:25:56.740
how do you do it? You put the seed in the Mother Earth.

01:25:56.941 --> 01:26:00.475
And She has the power and She just sprouts it.

01:26:00.676 --> 01:26:03.636
In the same way it has to happen that it should sprout.

01:26:03.849 --> 01:26:08.490
In that same manner it should sprout spontaneously.

01:26:08.691 --> 01:26:11.758
Sahaj. Saha – with, ja - born.

01:26:11.959 --> 01:26:17.419
This is born with you. To get this yoga is your birthright.

01:26:17.631 --> 01:26:21.117
Get it, and for Indians it’s a special blessing

01:26:21.318 --> 01:26:24.220
that they get it very fast. Just like their independence,

01:26:24.421 --> 01:26:27.421
without any effort. Without much struggle, I should say.

01:26:27.632 --> 01:26:29.710
Others have struggled much more than us.

01:26:29.928 --> 01:26:34.634
When you get that you also loose it very fast.

01:26:34.835 --> 01:26:39.826
So those people who understand Kundalini

01:26:40.027 --> 01:26:42.636
understand the essence of everything

01:26:42.832 --> 01:26:48.006
and they understand that all the religions are on one essence.

01:26:48.207 --> 01:26:51.485
They are the flowers of the same tree.

01:26:51.713 --> 01:26:53.629
Stupidly we are fighting here.

01:26:53.830 --> 01:27:00.446
Christ has said those who are not against us are with us.

01:27:00.647 --> 01:27:03.094
Who are those? Christians don’t want to find out.

01:27:03.295 --> 01:27:06.216
Now they are after Christ’s life.

01:27:06.443 --> 01:27:08.843
Hindus don’t want to know about it.

01:27:09.092 --> 01:27:12.378
There is no greatness of art. I would say now,

01:27:12.579 --> 01:27:17.875
there was a problem in Aurangabad and the people attacked.

01:27:18.141 --> 01:27:19.883
They should not have attacked. All right.

01:27:20.055 --> 01:27:23.722
But we have to understand what has happened in this one,

01:27:23.923 --> 01:27:27.722
where we have gone wrong. We should see our mistake.

01:27:27.923 --> 01:27:31.297
In a masjid, whatever it is, it’s a God place.

01:27:31.532 --> 01:27:35.195
It’s a God’s place, and in a masjid if they are meditating,

01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:38.801
you should not make noise. If you are insulting that,

01:27:39.002 --> 01:27:41.822
you are insulting Vittala Himself.

01:27:43.657 --> 01:27:45.887
In the Vittala mandir you have a different type of aarti,

01:27:46.088 --> 01:27:49.734
all right, have it. In that aarti if somebody starts

01:27:49.935 --> 01:27:55.195
doing discotheque dance, how will you like it?

01:27:56.926 --> 01:28:00.059
In the same way if that is a place of ibaadat,

01:28:00.312 --> 01:28:03.697
is a place where people are praying in a dhyana.

01:28:03.898 --> 01:28:06.991
Just now we are so quiet, we are sitting in the

01:28:07.202 --> 01:28:13.741
surrounding horrible noises, but everything is quiet.

01:28:13.942 --> 01:28:15.390
That’s why we are enjoying.

01:28:15.591 --> 01:28:19.743
And if that is the way they want to meditate,

01:28:19.944 --> 01:28:21.955
must we go and disturb them

01:28:22.158 --> 01:28:25.181
for something that some boys are troubling and all that?

01:28:25.354 --> 01:28:28.287
Can’t we respect it? To show our greatness,

01:28:28.479 --> 01:28:31.634
khorpana, must we do that?

01:28:31.835 --> 01:28:34.327
Is it very important that at that time

01:28:34.528 --> 01:28:39.434
we should take these besura, betaala bands in front of that?

01:28:43.051 --> 01:28:47.407
Why don’t we see that we also must respect

01:28:47.608 --> 01:28:50.118
whatever is God, everywhere?

01:28:50.319 --> 01:28:51.935
This is the mistake we commit.

01:28:52.136 --> 01:28:55.474
In the name of religion we insult God Himself.

01:28:55.683 --> 01:28:58.349
When they say “Allah-O-Akbar”, they mean Virat,

01:28:58.550 --> 01:29:01.057
means Shri Krishna Itself. If you come to Sahaja yoga,

01:29:01.230 --> 01:29:03.237
you will know that they are all related to each other.

01:29:03.433 --> 01:29:06.833
That Mohammed Sahib was nothing (but) a maha medha.

01:29:07.606 --> 01:29:12.089
He was the Dattatreya Himself. This is the medha,

01:29:12.290 --> 01:29:14.891
and He is settled down there.

01:29:15.157 --> 01:29:18.196
I know He was given poison and He was tortured.

01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:21.871
And the same thing - when we do it by saying

01:29:22.072 --> 01:29:24.415
that Mohammed was wrong. He was not wrong.

01:29:24.611 --> 01:29:26.871
Who was wrong? Are the Muslims. Who was wrong?

01:29:27.072 --> 01:29:29.470
Is the Hindus. Who was wrong? Are the Christians.

01:29:29.671 --> 01:29:31.665
They are all against all these prophets,

01:29:31.868 --> 01:29:35.988
all these great incarnations and bringing bad name to them.

01:29:36.189 --> 01:29:41.353
Let us start understanding. Let us start respecting.

01:29:41.554 --> 01:29:45.592
Let us be great. Let us be noble.

01:29:45.818 --> 01:29:50.068
Let us be higher people of affection,

01:29:50.287 --> 01:29:53.412
compassion and understanding. Let us be those people.

01:29:53.615 --> 01:29:56.577
Let us start. Let us start a nucleus like that.

01:29:56.778 --> 01:29:58.357
If you can do it, we can

01:29:58.558 --> 01:30:02.000
make all those who have gone down also

01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:04.710
pull back all of them upward.

01:30:05.335 --> 01:30:08.073
It was built in this country - this system.

01:30:08.222 --> 01:30:12.529
Whole thing was built in this country that we should ascend.

01:30:12.730 --> 01:30:14.917
Very beautifully done longtime back

01:30:15.113 --> 01:30:19.474
but was lost in the deluge of modern life.

01:30:19.675 --> 01:30:23.336
So people should take to all the traditional things,

01:30:23.514 --> 01:30:26.000
which are beautiful, all the traditional games

01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:31.706
that are beautiful, all the traditions that give respect.

01:30:31.907 --> 01:30:33.585
If you loose the sense of respect,

01:30:33.786 --> 01:30:37.848
you have lost the humanity, absolutely hundred percent.

01:30:38.075 --> 01:30:39.739
If you do not know how to respect,

01:30:39.926 --> 01:30:42.624
you are not an Indian at all. You are not an Indian.

01:30:42.812 --> 01:30:47.744
Don’t call yourself an Indian. You must learn how to respect.

01:30:47.945 --> 01:30:51.774
Respect gives you greatness. It makes you humble

01:30:51.982 --> 01:30:56.922
like Tukharaama said,

01:30:57.123 --> 01:31:02.370
“anurenu uni thodkaa, tukha aakaashaye vadaa”.

01:31:02.589 --> 01:31:04.620
When he becomes smaller than anurenu

01:31:04.846 --> 01:31:07.974
then he becomes aakaashaye vadaa.

01:31:08.175 --> 01:31:11.724
In the vadaat tree the seed is so very small,

01:31:11.912 --> 01:31:14.216
if you see that, it’s a extremely small

01:31:14.423 --> 01:31:16.623
and the biggest tree it creates.

01:31:17.193 --> 01:31:21.460
Once Shastriji said that even the small thing can do great job.

01:31:21.695 --> 01:31:24.822
And that’s what we are seeing. That a small thing,

01:31:25.023 --> 01:31:26.968
only when you become humble,

01:31:27.195 --> 01:31:30.023
then the grace of God surrounds your humility,

01:31:30.224 --> 01:31:32.972
surrounds your personality. And you become

01:31:33.173 --> 01:31:38.129
really a personality that has authority of God.

01:31:38.330 --> 01:31:42.025
That is the greatness of God - in that humility it works,

01:31:42.221 --> 01:31:43.465
it just works.

01:31:43.666 --> 01:31:47.286
After realization, the attention becomes enlightened.

01:31:47.489 --> 01:31:50.767
By that attention, looking at people

01:31:50.968 --> 01:31:52.296
you can raise their Kundalini.

01:31:52.497 --> 01:31:55.356
Only looking at people you can cure them.

01:31:55.575 --> 01:31:58.395
All your powers are expressed in your attention

01:31:58.614 --> 01:32:01.773
and you don’t get lost in the matter.

01:32:01.974 --> 01:32:03.817
Then you become the Baadshah.

01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:08.702
Baadshah is a person who doesn’t mind anything;

01:32:08.903 --> 01:32:10.624
he doesn’t need anything.

01:32:10.825 --> 01:32:14.296
As you know, I am born in a rich family and

01:32:14.421 --> 01:32:18.947
My in-laws are also rich. My husband is rich and all that,

01:32:19.148 --> 01:32:21.632
but I can live there, I can sleep there.

01:32:21.827 --> 01:32:24.155
I have lived in the jungles. I have lived along the rivers.

01:32:24.356 --> 01:32:28.132
I have no problem because - why do I want anything?

01:32:28.288 --> 01:32:30.672
Nothing can dominate Me. You can sleep on the stones.

01:32:30.873 --> 01:32:31.896
You can do what you like.

01:32:32.068 --> 01:32:35.177
But that’s only possible when you become the yogi.

01:32:35.389 --> 01:32:37.177
When you become the yogi, you can do it.

01:32:37.342 --> 01:32:39.544
These four hundred people, who have come from abroad,

01:32:39.701 --> 01:32:42.083
come from very rich families, very good families.

01:32:42.284 --> 01:32:44.688
And they have got all the comforts that you can think of,

01:32:44.889 --> 01:32:49.378
but they want to live under the sky, near the river.

01:32:49.636 --> 01:32:53.292
They just don’t want to see the cement on top of their heads.

01:32:53.526 --> 01:32:57.532
They are so much, now, in the higher level

01:32:57.733 --> 01:33:00.256
that they don’t want to see anything that is gross.

01:33:00.457 --> 01:33:03.597
They want this mud.

01:33:03.786 --> 01:33:08.912
They want this beautiful clay of this country.

01:33:09.113 --> 01:33:13.365
Kya deshachi maati bokha lagait. Tithe baslaat tumhi.

01:33:13.607 --> 01:33:17.340
You are sitting on top of that; and what are you doing?

01:33:18.928 --> 01:33:24.485
Your attention, where is it? Where is your attention?

01:33:24.686 --> 01:33:28.279
You must keep your attention to God;

01:33:28.475 --> 01:33:31.719
and once that is there, you’ll become a yogi.

01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:34.571
And once you become the yogi,

01:33:34.772 --> 01:33:41.443
you will be in the realm of God, in the kingdom of heaven.

01:33:41.644 --> 01:33:43.436
When you’ll be blessed with everything

01:33:43.637 --> 01:33:45.910
you don’t have to desire. It will just before,

01:33:46.111 --> 01:33:50.418
you will not know how to contain all that God has given you,

01:33:50.619 --> 01:33:53.095
the kshema that He gives you. Apart from that,

01:33:53.275 --> 01:33:57.660
your attention itself will be such a powerful

01:33:57.861 --> 01:34:01.578
instrument that you can change the entire universe with that.

01:34:01.778 --> 01:34:04.711
Why I beg of you? - Because you are Indians.

01:34:05.004 --> 01:34:07.835
You are born in this country because of poorva sukrutaas,

01:34:08.062 --> 01:34:10.795
because what you have done in last life.

01:34:11.054 --> 01:34:13.859
That’s why you are born in this great country.

01:34:14.078 --> 01:34:17.945
But it’s like those who have teeth don’t have the chanas to eat,

01:34:18.146 --> 01:34:21.536
and those who don’t have teeth have got the chanas.

01:34:21.737 --> 01:34:24.604
It’s like that. The situation is very bad.

01:34:24.885 --> 01:34:27.252
You are the ones who can become the greatest yogis,

01:34:27.464 --> 01:34:29.585
but you do not. But the western people

01:34:29.786 --> 01:34:33.395
who do not have any idea about holiness,

01:34:33.596 --> 01:34:37.051
about auspiciousness, nothing they are so ignorant

01:34:37.263 --> 01:34:41.210
they shoot off much faster than you can.

01:34:41.434 --> 01:34:44.572
So I have to make a humble request to you that

01:34:44.753 --> 01:34:51.661
do not get enamored by this attention that goes to any matter.

01:34:51.862 --> 01:34:55.672
But matter itself is made by God.

01:34:56.954 --> 01:35:00.391
So despite the fact human beings got involved

01:35:00.595 --> 01:35:02.662
into the material advancement,

01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:06.539
it is today helping us in Sahaja yoga in a very great way.

01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:11.135
For example, this mic is important,

01:35:11.336 --> 01:35:13.635
is also useful for carrying My vibrations.

01:35:13.836 --> 01:35:18.619
It carries vibrations. Camera shows all the light around Me

01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:21.769
and shows all the kinds of forms I have.

01:35:21.970 --> 01:35:24.550
So whatever you may try,

01:35:24.751 --> 01:35:28.266
the Divine will sparkle through that matter also

01:35:28.470 --> 01:35:32.532
and will establish the existence of Divinity.

01:35:33.642 --> 01:35:37.667
But if you cut out the Divinity out of the matter,

01:35:37.868 --> 01:35:41.809
you will be hit hard and you’ll be submerged

01:35:42.004 --> 01:35:46.199
in the greater ocean of ignorance and filth.

01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:51.586
So keep Divinity at your heart and then deal with matter.

01:35:51.787 --> 01:35:55.646
And then you will understand what is the use of this matter,

01:35:55.795 --> 01:35:57.862
and what one has to do with it.

01:35:58.099 --> 01:36:02.147
Tomorrow, in Hindi, I will be talking about the rest of it

01:36:02.348 --> 01:36:10.155
about the truth because today I’ve talked about the Chit.

01:36:10.343 --> 01:36:12.108
Tomorrow I’ll be talking about the truth.

01:36:12.281 --> 01:36:16.095
Sat-Chit-Anand. And third day I’ll be talking

01:36:16.296 --> 01:36:19.098
about Anand to you in Marathi language.

01:36:19.317 --> 01:36:25.413
I hope you will sit down and meditate on what I have said.

01:36:25.614 --> 01:36:28.959
I do not want to condemn any culture as such.

01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:32.445
But I want to protect you from what has happened

01:36:32.646 --> 01:36:35.542
to that culture and where it has gone,

01:36:35.754 --> 01:36:40.795
to bring you back to your own great culture,

01:36:40.996 --> 01:36:43.507
which came to us in thousands of years.

01:36:43.718 --> 01:36:46.986
Their culture is very, very, very new,

01:36:47.187 --> 01:36:49.133
it’s very new and one day they will also have

01:36:49.334 --> 01:36:51.267
the same culture as we have.

01:36:51.584 --> 01:36:54.037
But why not we short circuit it

01:36:54.311 --> 01:36:57.594
and adjust ourselves to this great culture,

01:36:57.795 --> 01:37:05.607
which is so much God oriented, not money oriented,

01:37:05.772 --> 01:37:09.642
ego oriented but God oriented?

01:37:09.843 --> 01:37:16.119
Let us all attain that state of yogi.

01:37:16.347 --> 01:37:18.791
I hope today it will happen to all of you

01:37:18.979 --> 01:37:21.708
and that you’ll all get your realization.

01:37:21.909 --> 01:37:23.471
May God bless you.
