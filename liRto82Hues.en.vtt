00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.381
I’m just watching all the beauty.

00:00:12.082 --> 00:00:15.186
You looked so beautiful at the airport.

00:00:15.387 --> 00:00:24.873
Such a joy for me to see you in that shape.

00:00:26.272 --> 00:00:28.548
It’s a

00:00:34.387 --> 00:00:41.820
rare occasion sometimes

00:00:42.671 --> 00:00:53.951
that you feel oneness with the whole
universe,

00:00:55.246 --> 00:01:00.237
absolutely oneness with the whole universe,

00:01:00.438 --> 00:01:09.357
when you feel the love that exists between
all of you.

00:01:09.558 --> 00:01:12.893
It’s the love between you,

00:01:14.471 --> 00:01:17.140
oneness between you,

00:01:17.341 --> 00:01:23.070
the way you all have opened your heart
to each other

00:01:24.158 --> 00:01:30.785
as good human beings, as realized souls,
as saints -

00:01:30.986 --> 00:01:45.979
it’s the most fulfilling and satisfying
thing for Me.

00:01:47.962 --> 00:01:57.172
When a saint used to meet another
saint, say in India, what would happen?

00:01:57.982 --> 00:02:05.841
There was a saint in Maharashtra who was
a tailor, but he was a saint.

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:10.822
Saint is a saint whether he’s a tailor
or he could be anything.

00:02:11.023 --> 00:02:16.361
And there was another saint who was
a potter,

00:02:16.562 --> 00:02:25.212
who used to make pots, and things like
that, out of clay.

00:02:26.808 --> 00:02:39.447
So this saint, Namadeva, went to see
this potter

00:02:41.053 --> 00:02:45.945
who was making some pots out of clay.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.073
And he looked at him.

00:02:55.218 --> 00:02:59.630
And the feeling that came into his heart
is expressed -

00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:06.157
he was a great poet also, Namadeva -
so he says,

00:03:07.838 --> 00:03:15.190
in Marathi it is, but I’ll translate it
in English - “I came here

00:03:17.366 --> 00:03:23.112
to see the Chaitanya, the formless,

00:03:23.662 --> 00:03:28.387
but the formless is standing before me
in the form”.

00:03:29.134 --> 00:03:32.386
So to appreciate

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:40.697
the other saint he said, “Now the whole
Chaitanya, the whole

00:03:43.033 --> 00:03:47.557
all-pervading power of God’s love has come
in your form before me.

00:03:47.758 --> 00:03:50.074
I see it”.

00:03:51.846 --> 00:03:55.047
How to address, just think of it.

00:03:55.248 --> 00:03:59.392
At that moment, spontaneously he said this.

00:04:01.235 --> 00:04:08.118
That is how you are all saints, and saints
have to see that,

00:04:08.656 --> 00:04:15.663
that you are the form of that love
of God’s all pervading power.

00:04:15.864 --> 00:04:20.193
You are in the form of that, all of you.

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:25.720
I think that day, you were standing
in the rain and sleet

00:04:25.921 --> 00:04:29.393
with all your children. For a Mother it’s
too much

00:04:29.594 --> 00:04:34.731
to see, such beautiful feelings for me.

00:04:34.932 --> 00:04:38.657
But the feelings among yourselves,

00:04:39.976 --> 00:04:44.797
the open-heartedness, the Pure love,

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:50.231
that filled the whole atmosphere
with such beauty.

00:04:50.928 --> 00:04:53.852
It’s not just talking,

00:04:55.604 --> 00:05:02.139
it’s not just writing letters or sending
Birthday cards or something like that;

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.118
it’s from the heart,

00:05:06.383 --> 00:05:11.204
you have to feel each other that
you are all saints.

00:05:12.013 --> 00:05:18.036
You are different people, you have
to support each other,

00:05:18.705 --> 00:05:22.010
you have to look after each other, you have
to understand each other

00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:26.965
because you are the people of a different
awareness

00:05:27.166 --> 00:05:31.918
living among people who are blind,
who can hit you,

00:05:32.118 --> 00:05:37.041
they can do some harm to you.

00:05:42.572 --> 00:05:46.351
The other day I was reading Gyaneshwara;
can you imagine,

00:05:46.552 --> 00:05:50.329
he died at the age of 23 years,

00:05:51.667 --> 00:05:55.132
at such an young age as 23 years.

00:05:55.333 --> 00:06:01.343
And the Gyaneshwari he wrote was
at the age of 21 years. And what a genius!

00:06:01.544 --> 00:06:07.408
I mean, you read it, you just don’t
understand,

00:06:07.609 --> 00:06:14.874
how could he penetrate so deep.
He described you all,

00:06:17.116 --> 00:06:21.245
as I have told you many-a-times he has
described you

00:06:21.446 --> 00:06:35.055
as the oceans of, the walking oceans
of Ambrose - Ambrosia.

00:06:37.882 --> 00:06:47.438
Talking trees, and the forest of

00:06:52.628 --> 00:07:00.899
the trees of bliss and beauty.

00:07:01.116 --> 00:07:03.505
That wherever you’ll go you’ll bless
people.

00:07:03.725 --> 00:07:08.211
Wherever you will stand you’ll be
auspicious,

00:07:08.412 --> 00:07:12.974
you will create harmony, peace and joy.

00:07:13.175 --> 00:07:19.158
That’s your work, that’s your style,
that’s what you are here for.

00:07:20.553 --> 00:07:24.441
But beware, you ought to be very careful,

00:07:24.642 --> 00:07:28.650
because the surroundings seem to be
quite deceptive

00:07:28.851 --> 00:07:31.702
and quite troublesome.

00:07:32.188 --> 00:07:40.658
And from that surrounding you are coming
out suddenly into a new surrounding

00:07:40.859 --> 00:07:47.259
where you have known what is Divine love,
what is Divinity.

00:07:48.459 --> 00:07:54.797
One has to be very careful because
the forces that are negative

00:07:54.998 --> 00:08:03.473
are very strong, and working at you
all the time,

00:08:03.674 --> 00:08:10.859
because you’ve come from matter, you have
evolved from matter

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:23.834
and it’s easy to go to matter,
to materialism, to the materialistic ideas;

00:08:28.001 --> 00:08:33.168
and this materialism takes you
to primitiveness.

00:08:33.936 --> 00:08:36.507
All your culture, all your beauty will
drop out

00:08:36.717 --> 00:08:43.574
as soon as you take to materialism.
If everything becomes money

00:08:44.136 --> 00:08:49.708
there’s no place for God, no place
for love,

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:57.388
no place for beauty or for any graciousness.

00:09:00.374 --> 00:09:05.121
Money is for us, we are not for the money.

00:09:05.322 --> 00:09:08.495
Money should be at our command.

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:14.994
We don’t have to give up anything for that.

00:09:18.816 --> 00:09:25.361
And here then we see the materialism
coming up in a very different way,

00:09:25.562 --> 00:09:30.600
very subtle ways, and we do not see it.

00:09:30.801 --> 00:09:35.245
When we start saying “my, mine, this is
mine”

00:09:36.972 --> 00:09:42.078
then you are slowly drifting towards
materialism.

00:09:44.424 --> 00:09:48.060
When you see yourself in the collective,

00:09:50.232 --> 00:09:56.570
that’s the only way you can get out
of materialism.

00:09:56.827 --> 00:10:00.195
Because you are in reality a collective
being.

00:10:00.396 --> 00:10:04.698
You are not an individual that way.

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:09.004
But the matter divides you from each other.

00:10:11.117 --> 00:10:13.567
And when you realize

00:10:13.768 --> 00:10:18.473
that we are not slaves of matter, matter is
our slave,

00:10:19.259 --> 00:10:23.660
we are not going to be dominated
by any matter,

00:10:25.513 --> 00:10:29.350
then you can feel that love.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.239
One goes to absurd limits if you take
to materialism;

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:40.631
and everything can be explained in the name
of materialism.

00:10:42.536 --> 00:10:48.093
But in the name of Divine how far can you
go and explain?

00:10:49.229 --> 00:10:51.136
You have to just enjoy it.

00:10:51.354 --> 00:10:56.658
When you enjoy you don’t want to explain
or talk about it, you just want to enjoy.

00:10:57.809 --> 00:11:00.837
Divinity is to be enjoyed within and
without.

00:11:01.038 --> 00:11:06.605
It’s within you, divinity is within you,
but is to be enjoyed.

00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:10.227
That’s only possible if you understand

00:11:10.428 --> 00:11:14.866
that you are not going to be dominated
by any matter whatsoever.

00:11:16.701 --> 00:11:20.036
I’m sorry I’m here for such a short time,

00:11:20.237 --> 00:11:25.575
I wish I could be with you forever, which
I am, I think.

00:11:27.325 --> 00:11:30.563
But you have brothers and sisters
everywhere,

00:11:30.764 --> 00:11:38.353
the whole world has this message with them.

00:11:38.554 --> 00:11:41.451
You, some of you have met them in India.

00:11:41.652 --> 00:11:46.290
All the Indians have sent their love
to you, lots of love,

00:11:46.491 --> 00:11:49.983
and they didn’t know what to send you
from there, something special;

00:11:50.184 --> 00:11:53.510
so they sent Me.

00:12:05.159 --> 00:12:09.493
Sometimes I feel all of us should meet
somewhere; all of us

00:12:09.694 --> 00:12:13.928
from all over the world, from every corner
of the world, all the great saints

00:12:14.136 --> 00:12:19.091
who are in these modern times should meet
each other, talk to each other,

00:12:19.292 --> 00:12:27.252
enjoy each other and understand each other.

00:12:29.023 --> 00:12:35.744
That’s the time we’ll think that a new era
has started

00:12:35.945 --> 00:12:43.879
of love, of trust, of enjoyment of other
human beings.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.835
When you start enjoying another person

00:12:47.036 --> 00:12:51.476
then only we can say that you are
in the collective.

00:12:51.915 --> 00:12:57.740
Like My finger, if it pains the another one
tries to soothe it,

00:12:57.948 --> 00:13:01.793
and I feel the soothing, without feeling
any gratitude

00:13:01.994 --> 00:13:07.017
or without feeling any sort of a obligation.

00:13:08.702 --> 00:13:14.892
So always I say about collectivity. Those
who cannot be collective,

00:13:15.093 --> 00:13:19.650
those who cannot open their hearts,
those who keep aloof,

00:13:19.851 --> 00:13:23.862
those who think they are - some of them
might be thinking “We are great Sahaja Yogis

00:13:24.062 --> 00:13:27.246
because we are very old Sahaja Yogis,”
some might be thinking

00:13:27.447 --> 00:13:32.470
“we are very intelligent”, some that
“we are rich, and poor” and all that,

00:13:32.671 --> 00:13:38.989
all these differences should disappear.
Who is crying?

00:13:45.689 --> 00:13:49.091
She’s crying? What’s the matter?

00:13:49.292 --> 00:13:54.151
(Yogini speaks: “Clapping made him jump”.
Yogi: “The clapping made him jump, Mother”.

00:13:54.352 --> 00:13:57.387
Shri Mataji: “And loudly?” Yogi: “The
clapping made the baby jump, Shri Mataji”.

00:13:57.588 --> 00:14:00.637
Oh!

00:14:10.301 --> 00:14:15.484
One day they’ll all grow up. I was thinking
when they’ll grow up

00:14:15.685 --> 00:14:20.189
they’ll clap much more than you will do!

00:14:22.495 --> 00:14:26.209
Little more time we need, somehow.

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:31.185
All these great people will be becoming
great Sahaja Yogis

00:14:31.386 --> 00:14:39.176
and will give us such a pleasure, such
a joy, such a happiness.

00:14:40.416 --> 00:14:45.262
Today I wanted to speak about something,

00:14:45.851 --> 00:14:48.290
but I’ll just put it as a question
to you all.

00:14:48.491 --> 00:14:52.172
And I would like to have an answer
from you.

00:14:52.373 --> 00:14:56.765
You can write to Me and let’s see,
or you can discuss.

00:14:56.966 --> 00:15:08.500
That as formerly, as other saints have
said,

00:15:09.121 --> 00:15:14.190
that once you get your realization
you are lost,

00:15:15.325 --> 00:15:20.737
you can’t speak about it. You can just tell
them by some similes, metaphors,

00:15:20.962 --> 00:15:30.881
this, that, but you cannot really give them
the experience by telling them.

00:15:32.076 --> 00:15:35.816
And that’s why many saints decided that
after realization

00:15:36.017 --> 00:15:40.253
it’s better to disappear. Even Gyaneshwara
took his samadhi,

00:15:40.454 --> 00:15:45.409
he went into a room and he died
in that room.

00:15:46.131 --> 00:15:51.474
Because they could not say much about it,
they could not tell much about it.

00:15:51.675 --> 00:15:54.839
But today that’s not the situation.

00:15:55.188 --> 00:16:00.230
Like Kabira has said that,

00:16:00.431 --> 00:16:05.378
“When a drop becomes the ocean,
what can you say?”.

00:16:05.579 --> 00:16:10.412
You are lost, you are no more there,
you are all finished.

00:16:10.613 --> 00:16:14.201
So what has happened in Sahaja Yoga,
today’s Sahaja Yoga,

00:16:14.402 --> 00:16:19.032
that we are all talking about it,
experiencing it and enjoying it?

00:16:19.201 --> 00:16:23.646
That’s the question for all of the Sahaja
Yogis to solve.

00:16:30.927 --> 00:16:34.248
(Smiles and talks to somebody. Name
not clear, sounds like “Elliot”.)

00:16:34.449 --> 00:16:37.017
You can explain?

00:16:39.043 --> 00:16:41.969
Did you hear My question?

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:46.273
No? You didn’t hear My question

00:16:47.761 --> 00:16:51.390
You see, what I said was that formerly

00:16:51.591 --> 00:16:56.251
those people who got realisation got lost,
alright?

00:16:56.493 --> 00:17:01.391
As you were lost just now into thoughtless
awareness!

00:17:03.441 --> 00:17:10.254
But you can come back and you can tell
people, you can talk about it,

00:17:10.462 --> 00:17:14.345
and many people disappeared.

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:19.571
Actually, they didn’t want to live after
getting realization for a long time,

00:17:19.785 --> 00:17:25.310
because they could not explain, talk
to people about it.

00:17:25.511 --> 00:17:30.556
Also they said that, "How can a person
who has no tongue

00:17:30.757 --> 00:17:36.922
tell about the taste of the jiggery?",
it’s a kind of sweet.

00:17:37.106 --> 00:17:42.951
So there was a problem with them,
all of them had a problem.

00:17:43.161 --> 00:17:45.490
But now you don’t have that problem.

00:17:45.691 --> 00:17:50.448
So what has happened in Sahaja Yoga
that you have no problem?

00:17:51.557 --> 00:17:55.309
So think it over and write to Me, alright?

00:17:59.942 --> 00:18:04.923
So I don’t know what to say anymore.

00:18:07.475 --> 00:18:10.079
Just we are enjoying our rapport
with each other, isn’t it?

00:18:10.248 --> 00:18:14.489
That’s all, sitting down here. Anybody
has any questions?

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:20.200
Anybody who is a new person can ask
a question, would be good idea.

00:18:25.953 --> 00:18:29.838
Because these people have no questions now.

00:18:35.255 --> 00:18:37.748
Ask Me a question.

00:18:44.061 --> 00:18:47.991
(To somebody) I’ve heard the good news. Ah!

00:18:48.192 --> 00:18:51.605
Yogi: Shri Mataji, how should we approach
the spreading of Sahaja Yoga?

00:18:51.806 --> 00:18:53.739
Shri Mataji: How can we…?
Yogi: How should we approach

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.427
the spreading of Sahaja Yoga to new people?

00:18:56.628 --> 00:18:59.412
Shri Mataji: What? Another yogi: He said
how should we approach

00:18:59.613 --> 00:19:03.957
the spreading of Sahaja Yoga to new people,
to the new people.

00:19:04.158 --> 00:19:06.419
How should we express Sahaja Yoga,
Shri Mataji?

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:13.608
Shri Mataji: To them? Now, you see,
you’ll meet three types of new people.

00:19:13.946 --> 00:19:16.935
Firstly, those who are yogis,

00:19:17.136 --> 00:19:21.533
or you can call them as people
of previous births,

00:19:21.734 --> 00:19:26.127
who are already very knowledgeable
and are there,

00:19:26.328 --> 00:19:29.369
just they can feel it, this is it;

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:34.184
you won’t have much problem with them,
they’ll know it is so.

00:19:36.734 --> 00:19:43.608
To them it’s very obvious, and you’ll be
amazed the way they are there,

00:19:44.639 --> 00:19:48.318
how they have taken to it so easily.

00:19:49.806 --> 00:19:57.918
Now the second type are the people who
may be still believing, non believing,

00:19:58.119 --> 00:20:03.526
maybe some who are doubting, maybe;

00:20:03.727 --> 00:20:10.637
or maybe some who are asking questions
about it, quite a lot.

00:20:11.971 --> 00:20:17.547
So is not sufficient only for you to get
your realization,

00:20:18.154 --> 00:20:23.284
also not sufficient for you that you feel
the vibrations

00:20:23.484 --> 00:20:29.457
and that you can give realizations
to others, that won’t help much.

00:20:30.778 --> 00:20:38.834
You have to know how to deal with various
types of people.

00:20:39.035 --> 00:20:48.090
Like I would say a person who is a,
say, a priest,

00:20:49.657 --> 00:20:54.150
who comes to you and wants to talk to you
about God, this, that and all that.

00:20:54.351 --> 00:20:57.837
So you must know Bible very well,

00:20:58.038 --> 00:21:02.293
and know Bible in the way a Sahaja Yogi
should know.

00:21:02.494 --> 00:21:05.053
The other day Rustom telephoned
to tell Me that -

00:21:05.261 --> 00:21:13.045
I told him to study Koran because, I said,
Islam means surrender,

00:21:13.223 --> 00:21:17.278
but before realisation surrender has
no meaning.

00:21:17.479 --> 00:21:19.503
And he’s told Me that it’s written in Koran

00:21:19.704 --> 00:21:22.697
that unless and until you are connected
with God

00:21:22.898 --> 00:21:28.440
you cannot understand anything what is
written here. It’s clearly said.

00:21:28.641 --> 00:21:31.032
Now when the Muslims talk to you,
you can tell them:

00:21:31.233 --> 00:21:35.425
“This is written in Koran, are you
connected with God?”.

00:21:36.329 --> 00:21:40.056
Now, they might say, “Are you connected?”.

00:21:42.137 --> 00:21:46.079
Now, then if you say, “Yes”, then finished!

00:21:46.936 --> 00:21:52.841
Then Mr. Ego will come up, you see,
suddenly, and you be careful!

00:21:54.116 --> 00:21:59.307
So this subject should be treated
with a barge pole.

00:21:59.508 --> 00:22:07.990
Like, such a question if they ask… you see
they will be like that, “Are you that?”.

00:22:08.191 --> 00:22:10.368
Like in the beginning they used to ask Me,
“What’s your Father?

00:22:10.568 --> 00:22:14.268
What’s your Mother? Who are you?".
This, that, all those things, you see.

00:22:14.469 --> 00:22:18.804
So at that time you have to give
an answer to them -

00:22:20.663 --> 00:22:25.614
Can you give this lady a chair to sit down?
(Hindi) Sit down.

00:22:28.327 --> 00:22:32.873
No… Alright. (Hindi) Sit down... Sit down.

00:22:40.647 --> 00:22:47.454
So such a question if you answer
in that manner

00:22:47.655 --> 00:22:52.068
you have not been clever enough; you have
to be very clever.

00:22:54.143 --> 00:23:01.698
Then you should say, "You see, there are" -
avoid the subject, don’t answer;

00:23:01.899 --> 00:23:09.412
you just say, “See, there are descriptions
about a person who is a realised soul”.

00:23:10.636 --> 00:23:15.935
Jung has said that you have to become
collectively conscious.

00:23:17.025 --> 00:23:18.950
Now, what is collectively conscious?

00:23:19.151 --> 00:23:25.932
That is, on your central nervous system
you should be able to feel another person.

00:23:28.822 --> 00:23:33.693
Now Jung has said so, it’s a poet.

00:23:33.894 --> 00:23:37.785
Then you have got other people to quote:

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:41.352
William Blake you can quote,

00:23:41.553 --> 00:23:46.650
you can quote other poets or saints whom
you know,

00:23:47.101 --> 00:23:50.760
it depends on what sort of a person
you are dealing with.

00:23:50.961 --> 00:23:54.215
But just don’t say, ”Yes, I am
a realised soul”.

00:23:54.416 --> 00:23:59.593
People have been crucified, murdered,
poisoned for saying that.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:04.790
So be careful, put it on somebody else
and say,

00:24:04.991 --> 00:24:10.658
“Yes, the signs of a realised soul’s are
like this,

00:24:11.166 --> 00:24:14.029
that he has to be collectively conscious”.

00:24:14.239 --> 00:24:16.186
First of all that you have read Jung

00:24:16.387 --> 00:24:19.665
or you know so much about collective
consciousness itself

00:24:19.839 --> 00:24:24.624
will put them right in their own places,
to begin with.

00:24:24.825 --> 00:24:28.213
Because you have to be knowledgeable
in these modern times,

00:24:28.414 --> 00:24:31.774
and you should be able to communicate.

00:24:32.835 --> 00:24:35.343
Just by telling them, “I’m a realized soul,

00:24:35.544 --> 00:24:40.128
I have to awaken your Kundalini”, nobody
is going to believe you.

00:24:40.544 --> 00:24:46.498
Even in India people don’t believe that
we can give realisation -

00:24:46.699 --> 00:24:50.722
although they know about realisation, they
know about Kundalini, they know everything,

00:24:50.923 --> 00:24:55.244
but still they cannot believe that we,
like ordinary people,

00:24:55.445 --> 00:24:58.496
can give realisation to them.

00:24:59.707 --> 00:25:04.307
So in no way you should be diffident,
but try to bring them round

00:25:04.508 --> 00:25:08.225
through somebody else, because the human
nature is such,

00:25:08.426 --> 00:25:13.404
the one who is living, the one who
is existing, they don’t want to accept.

00:25:13.605 --> 00:25:18.893
Whosoever is dead, you see, and written
somewhere, anything, in black and white,

00:25:19.094 --> 00:25:23.856
and if you say in this book this is this
written, they’ll accept.

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:27.325
That’s why you have to be knowledgeable,
you must read books

00:25:27.526 --> 00:25:33.962
which are supportive of your realisation,
supportive of Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:34.323 --> 00:25:38.797
Then only you can talk to them. If you are
just having realisation,

00:25:38.998 --> 00:25:42.807
you can give realisation, you have got
vibrations, that won’t work out -

00:25:43.016 --> 00:25:50.662
especially in the Western countries where
people are too much here, nothing there.

00:25:51.526 --> 00:25:55.516
You have to tell them that we are also
intelligent enough,

00:25:55.717 --> 00:26:03.070
and we also understand it with our brains
and logic, what is the truth is.

00:26:03.271 --> 00:26:10.178
Then after their realisation, of course,
it’s much easier,

00:26:10.379 --> 00:26:16.317
but if you say, "Alright, come along, I
have to give you realisation” - you cannot.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:20.570
You cannot force them, you cannot - they
have to ask for it,

00:26:20.771 --> 00:26:23.359
after all there is a protocol of the Divine
also,

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.727
the Divine cannot fall at the feet
of people,

00:26:25.928 --> 00:26:30.719
“Oh please, come and have your
realisation!”. No, that’s too much.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:41.610
But there are ways and ways by which
you can ask people and work it out.

00:26:41.811 --> 00:26:45.995
But I must tell you one thing, that all
the Sahaja Yogis before,

00:26:46.196 --> 00:26:52.398
they started - I started Sahaja Yoga
in the West and especially in England also,

00:26:52.599 --> 00:26:55.602
you see, whenever I talked to them
they were very anxious

00:26:55.803 --> 00:27:00.232
how to get more people into Sahaja Yoga,
how to bring more people,

00:27:00.433 --> 00:27:04.029
what to do for more people, how to manage.

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:10.408
Or they would think somebody to be
very spiritual or something,

00:27:10.609 --> 00:27:12.762
“So, Mother, can I bring that fellow?”.

00:27:12.963 --> 00:27:17.779
And he would turn out to be a horrid stuff,
you see. It would burn My hands,

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:22.353
it would burn everything, and I would say,
“Now how do you mean? What made you think

00:27:22.554 --> 00:27:25.565
that he is spiritual?”. “Mother, he talks
so much of spirituality”.

00:27:25.766 --> 00:27:30.516
That’s not the thing. It is a calibre,
is a inner calibre

00:27:30.717 --> 00:27:33.230
a person must have. He may be
an ordinary person,

00:27:33.431 --> 00:27:36.569
he may not be earning so much money,
he might be on the street,

00:27:36.747 --> 00:27:38.581
but the inner calibre has to be there.

00:27:38.782 --> 00:27:44.268
Otherwise, what’s the use of breaking
your head against a wall?

00:27:44.783 --> 00:27:51.642
So, this idea of having more and more
is wrong.

00:27:52.516 --> 00:27:58.063
But to have people who are of that calibre,

00:27:58.264 --> 00:28:04.828
of that quality, and who deserve it.
So many do not deserve it.

00:28:07.008 --> 00:28:10.066
So what to do? You cannot just... it’s not
like a barber shop

00:28:10.282 --> 00:28:14.637
that you can make the head dressed the way
you like.

00:28:14.838 --> 00:28:19.155
The Sahastrara has to open out.

00:28:20.014 --> 00:28:24.122
You see, the Kundalini has to come out,
it has to work that way.

00:28:24.323 --> 00:28:26.848
You cannot just say, “Alright now,
you got realisation”,

00:28:27.049 --> 00:28:30.443
you can’t say that way, all the time
the Kundalini’s falling down,

00:28:30.644 --> 00:28:34.323
you should say, “Alright, sorry sir,
I’m sorry”. Finished.

00:28:34.545 --> 00:28:40.865
And the more you show as if you are seeking
elections for the votes,

00:28:41.066 --> 00:28:44.118
the more they’ll be worse.

00:28:44.387 --> 00:28:47.853
If somebody doesn’t get realisation,
well and good!

00:28:48.054 --> 00:28:51.340
For example, a lady met Me in a place

00:28:51.541 --> 00:29:00.756
and she said, “I want to have realisation”.
I said, “Alright, I’ll try”.

00:29:02.949 --> 00:29:06.813
Then she wrote three letters to Me,
sent her photographs and she…

00:29:07.014 --> 00:29:09.722
And then she said, “I don’t know why
You don’t write to me,

00:29:09.922 --> 00:29:11.931
I’ve been writing to You, this and that,

00:29:12.133 --> 00:29:17.775
I know it’s a difficult task to give
a realisation”. “Oh” - so I talked to her -

00:29:17.976 --> 00:29:20.978
“Alright, when I come next in June
you can come along”.

00:29:21.179 --> 00:29:26.381
But there could be somebody who might be
of that calibre, you can feel it,

00:29:26.582 --> 00:29:29.989
you are knowledgeable yourself, you can
feel the vibrations, you can feel it

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:33.160
and you can then take that person
seriously.

00:29:33.375 --> 00:29:40.930
So work on the people who are simple,
who have that calibre.

00:29:41.131 --> 00:29:46.014
Of course, they could be very much spoilt
also because of seeking,

00:29:46.198 --> 00:29:54.704
but if they are intense and sincere then
the best thing is to work it out

00:29:55.459 --> 00:30:01.425
with complete assiduity and attention
to such a person.

00:30:01.626 --> 00:30:04.930
But if it’s a fashion, you see, because
they are going to many gurus

00:30:05.131 --> 00:30:07.179
and they are doing some, lots of guru
shopping,

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:13.431
then you should say, “There’s no shop here,
you can’t pay, first of all, you can’t pay”.

00:30:15.775 --> 00:30:21.194
If they understand that, then it’s alright.

00:30:21.395 --> 00:30:25.182
Say like one fellow from the BBC came in
and he said,

00:30:25.383 --> 00:30:29.091
“We can’t believe in a guru who doesn’t
take any money”.

00:30:29.292 --> 00:30:32.253
I said, “Then alright, you go to such
a guru who takes money from you,

00:30:32.454 --> 00:30:38.236
I’ve nothing to say”. He said - what did
he say? – “Anglo Saxon brain”.

00:30:38.437 --> 00:30:43.049
I don’t know what that brain is specially,
made by God or not?

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:49.566
Cannot understand anyone who can do
such a thing without money.

00:30:49.796 --> 00:30:52.996
Such a person you should say, “Alright,
thank you very much, I’m sorry, you see,

00:30:53.197 --> 00:30:57.804
you are beyond me, you are too great,
sorry”.

00:30:58.005 --> 00:31:02.491
Not hurting the person. But such ideas,
such things if they have there in brains,

00:31:02.677 --> 00:31:09.998
you cannot break such a hard nut, can you?
And you should not feel sorry for them.

00:31:11.461 --> 00:31:16.111
First see their vibrations, see their
calibre. Calibre is the only way

00:31:16.312 --> 00:31:22.886
you can judge how much attention is to be
paid, what is to be done.

00:31:25.293 --> 00:31:30.116
For some people it’s so obvious,
so obvious.

00:31:30.426 --> 00:31:34.315
And some people go on arguing, arguing
with you.

00:31:34.516 --> 00:31:36.988
But all of them now are good Sahaja Yogis

00:31:37.189 --> 00:31:40.499
despite the fact they argued quite a lot
with Me to begin with;

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:42.706
now they are very good Sahaja Yogis.

00:31:42.907 --> 00:31:46.141
But now time has come for you to have
a quick result,

00:31:46.342 --> 00:31:50.398
and you will meet people who will be
very good, I’m sure you’ll meet all of them

00:31:50.599 --> 00:31:55.919
who are in England and you, you will be
able to manage them.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:59.600
Your ways, your methods, your styles
will convince them.

00:31:59.801 --> 00:32:02.262
Today, only, Doctor Brian has told Me
that many people

00:32:02.463 --> 00:32:05.623
are getting interested now in Sahaja Yoga,
because they can see the change

00:32:05.824 --> 00:32:13.821
that comes in, the transformation,
the confidence, everything that they see.

00:32:14.525 --> 00:32:19.523
So you should not try to force Sahaja Yoga
on anyone;

00:32:19.724 --> 00:32:28.270
it’s better that you see their calibre.
Calibre is very easy to make out.

00:32:28.471 --> 00:32:33.316
You just say it and it is there. They know,
yes, that’s it.

00:32:38.366 --> 00:32:40.896
Any other question?

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.606
Yogini: Shri Mataji, please, could you talk
about simpathy

00:32:45.807 --> 00:32:49.495
and compassion towards other Sahaja Yogis

00:32:49.696 --> 00:32:53.434
who have problems, who have some negativity
in them, please?

00:32:53.635 --> 00:32:56.636
Shri Mataji: I can’t hear. What’s it?
Clearly, I didn’t hear.

00:32:56.837 --> 00:33:00.084
You also didn’t hear, I’ve seen.
Yogi: Shri Mataji? Shri Mataji: Ah.

00:33:00.285 --> 00:33:02.368
Yogi: Could You speak about sympathy
and compassion

00:33:02.569 --> 00:33:08.274
towards other Sahaja Yogis who have
problems with negativity? Shri Mataji: Ah.

00:33:09.004 --> 00:33:13.524
Now. Sympathy and compassion;

00:33:13.753 --> 00:33:20.057
sympathy doesn’t get involved, then
it’s compassion.

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:25.975
Sympathy. ‘Sym’ means ‘share’, ‘pathy’
means ‘pathos’ –

00:33:26.176 --> 00:33:28.866
if you want to share the pathos of another
person

00:33:29.067 --> 00:33:30.818
then you are sympathizing with that person.

00:33:31.019 --> 00:33:36.442
Now supposing, somebody’s husband is dead
and that person is crying a lot

00:33:36.643 --> 00:33:42.041
and you also go and sit down and cry
louder than her.

00:33:43.072 --> 00:33:48.061
Then people will ask you, “Did you husband
die or her husband die?”.

00:33:50.142 --> 00:33:54.116
“No, no, I am just showing sympathy,
you know”.

00:33:55.435 --> 00:34:01.968
This is lip sympathy, of course.
Another is – may be the heartfelt sympathy.

00:34:04.112 --> 00:34:09.196
When it is heartfelt then you don’t cry;

00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:16.681
then you develop the opposite force

00:34:17.689 --> 00:34:21.585
to put that person right. What do you say
to that person?

00:34:21.786 --> 00:34:29.573
You should say, “See, now if you are born
you are going to die,

00:34:29.774 --> 00:34:33.627
everybody’s going to die, that’s, that’s
the system.

00:34:33.828 --> 00:34:37.680
Now, two persons never die together.

00:34:39.411 --> 00:34:43.326
This gentleman who has died now,
he’s your husband, alright,

00:34:43.527 --> 00:34:48.107
but now if you start crying like this,
he won’t have any peace,

00:34:48.308 --> 00:34:54.216
he’ll be hovering round you, and he might
be in limbo

00:34:54.417 --> 00:34:59.942
waiting for you to come there, or something
like that.

00:35:00.371 --> 00:35:05.674
So no use crying over him, on the contrary,
you should say, “I’m alright,

00:35:05.875 --> 00:35:10.178
don’t worry about me, I’m alright,

00:35:10.379 --> 00:35:14.276
get your realisation as I have got it".

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:17.201
This is the opposite force that you put.

00:35:17.402 --> 00:35:24.116
This is a real, real way of helping
that person.

00:35:24.965 --> 00:35:27.840
But the compassion is very different,

00:35:28.041 --> 00:35:33.636
compassion just flows, it doesn’t say
anything.

00:35:34.882 --> 00:35:43.137
Even you don’t see Me, even if you are
in the hospital, you know I am with you.

00:35:44.261 --> 00:35:52.661
It works. Even if you just think of Me,
it works.

00:35:55.189 --> 00:36:00.143
Even if you make some mistakes, you know
Mother will forgive.

00:36:01.225 --> 00:36:03.573
That’s compassion.

00:36:03.774 --> 00:36:07.634
Compassion is just flow, you don’t talk
about it, you don’t say anything.

00:36:07.835 --> 00:36:12.972
It just flows and covers you completely.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:18.265
And you enjoy that. That’s compassion;

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:28.252
it works - sympathy doesn’t work -
compassion works, it soothes you.

00:36:30.652 --> 00:36:41.705
It’s a very beautiful touch of love,
affection, kindness, protection.

00:36:43.136 --> 00:36:52.164
And you feel so confident that you are
under the protection of the Divine.

00:36:55.137 --> 00:37:03.763
So, this compassion has not to be shown
or to be dealt with.

00:37:03.964 --> 00:37:07.711
Now supposing, another Sahaja Yogi’s having
a problem.

00:37:07.912 --> 00:37:10.171
We have only two problems;

00:37:10.372 --> 00:37:15.450
as I say, “How many turns there are
in London? Only two, left or right”.

00:37:15.651 --> 00:37:20.196
In the same way, they have two problems:
either left or right.

00:37:20.742 --> 00:37:25.829
If it is the left one or the right one.

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:29.083
You know right one you have to beat
with the shoes, that’s all, finished.

00:37:29.284 --> 00:37:35.334
You don’t have to go and say anything
to the person, if he has right problems.

00:37:37.289 --> 00:37:41.949
Now if he has the left problem what
do you do?

00:37:42.312 --> 00:37:47.045
You need not go and talk to that person:
give him a bandhan,

00:37:47.246 --> 00:37:49.598
you can burn the name, you can do
what you like.

00:37:49.799 --> 00:37:54.428
But you need not face the person, you need
not tell the person that, “I’m helping you,

00:37:54.629 --> 00:37:58.316
I’m trying to do something for you”.
That’s wrong, that’s ignorance,

00:37:58.517 --> 00:38:05.639
you don’t have to say that; it just works,
it has to work by itself.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.634
But I don’t tell you that I’m going to help
you in any way, do I?

00:38:08.843 --> 00:38:19.465
Nothing of the kind. Wherever you are
you know I’m with you, all the time.

00:38:20.154 --> 00:38:24.388
In the same way, this compassion will work
whether you are sitting down here,

00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:29.234
if you are beating somebody with shoes
that person will come round.

00:38:29.436 --> 00:38:34.854
So they have only two problems, one is
the left or the right.

00:38:35.578 --> 00:38:41.034
If you try to sympathize with any one
of them you are in trouble.

00:38:42.631 --> 00:38:48.797
So best thing is not to directly help them,
but indirectly.

00:38:50.597 --> 00:38:56.394
Not to tell them that you are helping,
not even mention it to them;

00:38:56.595 --> 00:39:03.756
the concern is the point, the concern
about a person.

00:39:03.957 --> 00:39:07.835
Your attention should go there,
your attention is very active.

00:39:08.036 --> 00:39:12.502
It’s a very powerful thing you have got,
your attention acts.

00:39:12.703 --> 00:39:16.794
Just put your attention to that person,
with a concern,

00:39:16.971 --> 00:39:22.695
but no involvement: that is compassion.

00:39:22.896 --> 00:39:26.445
You have got it, you have got the power
of compassion

00:39:26.646 --> 00:39:31.913
in your attention now, you haven’t used it.

00:39:32.114 --> 00:39:38.964
Without taking any credit for it, without
showing it, without confronting it,

00:39:39.151 --> 00:39:44.830
just inside yourself you feel it, it will
work out.

00:39:45.031 --> 00:39:50.384
But for that you have to cleanse your own
attention, that’s very important.

00:39:50.585 --> 00:39:56.072
If your attention is loose type, if your
connection is not alright,

00:39:56.273 --> 00:40:02.777
then it won’t work out. But if you have
that kind of an attention

00:40:02.978 --> 00:40:13.310
which is silent, which is witnessing, which
is not involved, it’s dynamic, it works!

00:40:13.519 --> 00:40:20.421
All of you have to become like Me, I’m sure
you all can,

00:40:20.906 --> 00:40:24.846
and achieve that calibre of compassion.

00:40:25.047 --> 00:40:31.814
Alright? Do you follow now? Thank you.

00:40:41.677 --> 00:40:47.482
Any other question, Hester? No?

00:40:51.907 --> 00:40:58.118
Danya has any questions? You never
had them.

00:40:58.319 --> 00:41:05.745
Anybody else? Jason? None!

00:41:07.303 --> 00:41:10.863
Question-less people, I tell you.

00:41:18.989 --> 00:41:26.778
Best way is to enjoy others. Best way is
to enjoy others;

00:41:26.979 --> 00:41:33.292
and to enjoy yourself is to laugh
at yourself, that’s the best way.

00:41:33.524 --> 00:41:38.947
Address yourself, “You, Mister, now
come along, this is ego, I know.

00:41:39.148 --> 00:41:45.137
Ah, that’s it, that’s the one! No no no
no no no no no no, not me!

00:41:45.338 --> 00:41:48.252
I’ve had enough of it”.

00:41:49.355 --> 00:41:52.644
That’s how you enjoy yourself.

00:41:55.137 --> 00:41:58.308
And enjoy others, seeing their good points.

00:41:58.509 --> 00:42:05.411
Sweet, sweet things they do, very sweet
things. You don’t have to say anything.

00:42:05.612 --> 00:42:09.130
And we had 71 marriages, you can’t
believe it.

00:42:09.331 --> 00:42:13.818
And I looked at the brides and they were
all looking at Me from the angles, you see;

00:42:14.003 --> 00:42:20.364
and the eyes were telling the story
of their love and gratitude,

00:42:20.565 --> 00:42:23.860
and I don’t know what all they said.

00:42:24.061 --> 00:42:27.371
I was just watching them when they
were walking

00:42:27.572 --> 00:42:31.003
with their garlands in their hands,
slowly, slowly;

00:42:31.204 --> 00:42:40.288
the sweetness, the beauty of their
feelings; very slowly they were walking.

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:49.077
And then I saw the boys standing there,
looking at Me

00:42:50.262 --> 00:42:55.062
with tremendous feeling of oneness.

00:42:56.420 --> 00:43:00.223
You see, this cannot be enjoyed otherwise.

00:43:00.424 --> 00:43:03.896
Even with the body you cannot enjoy,
supposing you rub your hand,

00:43:04.097 --> 00:43:13.788
you won’t enjoy that much as you enjoy
other people, other sahaja yogis.

00:43:15.457 --> 00:43:21.243
And then the friends doing the leg-pulling
also I enjoy,

00:43:21.626 --> 00:43:26.473
the way they talk to each other I enjoy,
everything’s so enjoyable,

00:43:26.674 --> 00:43:31.488
it doesn’t hurt anyone, it doesn’t trouble
anyone.

00:43:32.864 --> 00:43:39.180
You are here to enjoy, God has created
this universe for you to enjoy.

00:43:39.634 --> 00:43:43.920
So only thing is that you must improve
your attention,

00:43:44.121 --> 00:43:48.150
cleanse your attention by meditation,

00:43:49.365 --> 00:43:54.661
always think of good things, not of bad
things.

00:43:55.474 --> 00:43:59.518
You should not react too much, just be
within yourself,

00:43:59.719 --> 00:44:02.717
see for yourself, witness everything.

00:44:02.918 --> 00:44:09.153
And you’ll be amazed, you’ll see beautiful
points, beautiful things all around you.

00:44:09.354 --> 00:44:17.530
So much of beauty which we are losing
because we cannot see it.

00:44:18.083 --> 00:44:22.644
So that deep, penetrating attention
of concern

00:44:22.828 --> 00:44:26.443
will solve all the problems, I’m sure.

00:44:29.759 --> 00:44:32.941
But ‘open your heart’ doesn’t mean that
you go and hug somebody

00:44:33.142 --> 00:44:35.697
and kiss somebody ten times, it doesn’t
mean that at all.

00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:40.196
On the contrary, it can be quite
embarrassing, you know?

00:44:45.526 --> 00:44:48.698
Any other questions?

00:45:01.450 --> 00:45:07.239
I, I had a problem there, you see, we,
they arranged a programme for Me

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:11.211
to speak to the young presidents’
organisation,

00:45:11.412 --> 00:45:16.916
the presidents of big, big – of big, big
organisations,

00:45:17.138 --> 00:45:20.750
business organisations, and I had to speak
to them.

00:45:20.951 --> 00:45:25.201
And one of the lady - of course, I mean -
the questions were

00:45:25.402 --> 00:45:28.090
very good and everything flowing (?) over,
and later on she says,

00:45:28.291 --> 00:45:33.110
“But I can’t believe it, because she is
not at all serious, you see”.

00:45:34.684 --> 00:45:36.962
And I laughed and laughed and laughed
with that, I said,

00:45:37.163 --> 00:45:41.428
“Now I cannot be serious anymore,
that was too much”.

00:45:42.275 --> 00:45:45.954
When there’s so much joy bubbling out, why,
how can you be serious?

00:45:46.155 --> 00:45:50.920
This is the idea of a saint that he should
be very serious, stern,

00:45:51.121 --> 00:45:58.360
going out with a stick in his hand
all the time hitting everyone on the head.

00:46:01.355 --> 00:46:06.537
So, any other question (indistinct word)?
No.

00:46:12.034 --> 00:46:13.690
We must have a hall here, big hall

00:46:13.891 --> 00:46:19.037
we should buy somewhere, we should be
able to buy.

00:46:19.434 --> 00:46:22.486
I’m thankful to people who are working
on Shudy Camp but I think

00:46:22.687 --> 00:46:25.012
you must hurry up now,

00:46:25.213 --> 00:46:29.327
people are coming for Guru Puja, I told
them we’ll have it in Shudy Camp.

00:46:29.528 --> 00:46:32.463
And otherwise if it is not ready we’ll have
to change the venue,

00:46:32.664 --> 00:46:36.269
so everybody must go and work it out,
I think, is important.

00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:40.308
We have money, we have no problem on that.

00:46:40.662 --> 00:46:45.813
We have to have a nice, grand, beautiful

00:46:47.031 --> 00:46:51.257
seminar before Guru Puja. And there are
many coming here,

00:46:51.458 --> 00:46:58.653
you’ll meet all of them, will be a very
nice time, real festival we’ll be having.

00:46:59.153 --> 00:47:03.672
So it would be better that you, all of you
combine together and work it out

00:47:03.873 --> 00:47:09.348
and also give different work to different
people;

00:47:09.549 --> 00:47:15.908
and they should all try to organize it
in a beautiful way

00:47:16.109 --> 00:47:19.929
that there’s no quarrel, nothing.
But you’ll see people, you see, will say,

00:47:20.138 --> 00:47:24.917
“Oh! This is the room I would like to have
for my wife”, things like that.

00:47:25.118 --> 00:47:28.137
Sounds stupidity.

00:47:29.595 --> 00:47:33.888
“This is the glass for me, I can’t give it
to you”.

00:47:34.158 --> 00:47:38.704
All such stupid things will be there, and
I think, for such people you should say,

00:47:38.905 --> 00:47:43.049
“You are not for Guru Puja, better not
be here”.

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:47.649
Everybody doesn’t deserve to be there.

00:47:48.771 --> 00:47:51.771
That’s you should find out, that what sort
of people they are.

00:47:51.972 --> 00:47:55.114
If they are fighting for all these little,
little things it’s best is to tell them

00:47:55.315 --> 00:47:59.653
that, “Sorry, you’d better not come
for Guru Puja”.

00:48:05.916 --> 00:48:09.663
So, the most important thing is that
in Guru Puja we have to receive

00:48:09.864 --> 00:48:15.200
a special capacity to be a guru ourselves.

00:48:15.401 --> 00:48:19.815
A special intelligence, a special
understanding,

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.818
a kind of a wisdom which gives you
discretion

00:48:24.019 --> 00:48:27.810
and the ability to argue out things.

00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:32.347
That will enhance your personality,

00:48:32.942 --> 00:48:42.507
a beautiful, dignified personality can be
created within yourselves,

00:48:42.708 --> 00:48:46.756
so for that you have to be there

00:48:46.957 --> 00:48:52.759
with all that dedication and understanding
about yourself.

00:48:54.565 --> 00:48:58.769
So I’m looking forward to this Guru Puja,
and everybody has to write.

00:48:58.970 --> 00:49:04.216
Now for Sahastrara day they are working
so hard, the people from Australia

00:49:04.417 --> 00:49:07.993
have printed so many posters, all over
the world they have sent it,

00:49:08.194 --> 00:49:11.899
they have sent it to you also the posters
of Sahastrar Day - have you brought it?

00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:15.298
No? You haven’t shown them.

00:49:23.086 --> 00:49:25.941
So next time you must show all of them,
they should see that,

00:49:26.174 --> 00:49:29.521
what they have done, how much; and
you must -

00:49:29.722 --> 00:49:32.897
we have no, nothing like a news from there
and this thing - but all this

00:49:33.098 --> 00:49:35.866
can be discussed among yourself; and you
should know about each other,

00:49:36.067 --> 00:49:39.147
what’s happening, where, and what ashram
is doing,

00:49:39.348 --> 00:49:45.375
what is the special work they are doing, and
what is the new thing they have discovered;

00:49:45.576 --> 00:49:51.017
all sorts of things you can find out from
each other. And you can tell others also.

00:49:51.218 --> 00:49:55.465
This is how you keep in communication
with each other.

00:49:55.666 --> 00:49:59.668
Oh, there’s a very good news, that
Doctor Rai,

00:49:59.869 --> 00:50:05.371
who is the Dean of the Faculty
of Physiology in Delhi University,

00:50:05.572 --> 00:50:11.650
started a research work on the comparative
study of Sahaja Yogis and others

00:50:11.851 --> 00:50:15.678
as far as the physiology is concerned.
And he’s found out that the people

00:50:15.879 --> 00:50:26.132
who are not Sahaja Yogis have a very low
resistance for diseases,

00:50:26.333 --> 00:50:29.875
their skin, skin resistance is less and
so many things he’s found out.

00:50:30.076 --> 00:50:33.529
And he has put it on, he’s tabulated
the whole thing,

00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:38.249
and that is been now approved
by the Government and is now published,

00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:42.025
going to be published also.
In the same way, you see,

00:50:42.226 --> 00:50:47.172
we are thinking of having a research here
done for people in Shudy Camp,

00:50:47.373 --> 00:50:50.429
so that we can also publish something
like that with the research.

00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:53.972
That so far, you see, so many have been
cured, so many got rid

00:50:54.173 --> 00:50:58.100
of their addictions, so many got rid
of their mental problems,

00:50:58.301 --> 00:51:01.501
so many things happened; but we haven’t
yet recorded it,

00:51:01.702 --> 00:51:05.707
we have not put it properly on the record.
Now this is what we are going to do now,

00:51:05.908 --> 00:51:09.686
anybody who has achieved something
or has felt better

00:51:09.887 --> 00:51:12.221
or has been cured or something like that

00:51:12.422 --> 00:51:15.683
must give it in writing to these people
so they record it,

00:51:15.884 --> 00:51:21.021
because, you see, in these modern times
they want everything in black and white,

00:51:21.222 --> 00:51:24.239
so that could be done very well here
in England.

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:26.985
Another thing I was thinking that now
“Nirmala Yoga”

00:51:27.186 --> 00:51:31.925
has stopped there because of this problem
of foreign exchange.

00:51:32.134 --> 00:51:37.480
So what we can do is to have
a “Nirmala Yog” published in India

00:51:37.681 --> 00:51:42.159
and sent here, and you can print it here
and sell it here,

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:44.570
so that the foreign exchange problem
doesn’t come in.

00:51:44.778 --> 00:51:46.961
Because foreign exchange is such a problem
in that country,

00:51:47.162 --> 00:51:52.829
you have to have a proper committee,
this, that, all headaches.

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:57.136
So you can sell them here and distribute
them here,

00:51:57.336 --> 00:52:01.348
it’s very easy, and Paul can help you
there. Paul, can’t you? (Paul: Yes...)

00:52:01.549 --> 00:52:05.892
Yes. So it’s alright. We get
the “Nirmala Yog” done there

00:52:06.093 --> 00:52:09.054
and just the copy sent here, translated.

00:52:09.255 --> 00:52:12.168
You can also add to it, you can also put
something into it

00:52:12.369 --> 00:52:14.588
and some things from there and some
things from here;

00:52:14.789 --> 00:52:21.278
you can distribute it to all the centres
here and we can start like that.

00:52:21.478 --> 00:52:25.094
Because they created a big problem
out of that last “Nirmala Yoga”,

00:52:25.296 --> 00:52:28.924
I’ve just stopped it, because you see we,
we are not very good

00:52:29.125 --> 00:52:33.602
at human laws, I think, sometimes you make
mistakes and I don’t want

00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:38.051
you people to be caught up into these human
laws. So you have to be careful.

00:52:38.252 --> 00:52:42.960
And we can do it, I think we can do it.
And as England is the heart

00:52:43.161 --> 00:52:46.479
it has to circulate everything.

00:52:49.187 --> 00:52:54.454
But the hearts must open out.
The conditioning is very bad here,

00:52:54.655 --> 00:52:59.255
you see, that you are told that you should
not express your feelings,

00:52:59.456 --> 00:53:02.760
you should not say anything, you should be
very poised,

00:53:02.961 --> 00:53:07.635
you should not talk about your feelings.
That’s not so in Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:07.836 --> 00:53:11.769
This is the heart and heart must speak,
heart must say;

00:53:11.970 --> 00:53:17.037
you must know how to say that you love
others. It’s very easy to say ‘I hate’,

00:53:17.238 --> 00:53:23.465
but it’s very difficult for people to say
‘I love you’. Because they are afraid,

00:53:23.666 --> 00:53:26.754
that if you commit like this, “Oh, so
you love me?

00:53:26.955 --> 00:53:31.537
So do this for me. You love me?
So do this for me.

00:53:32.606 --> 00:53:34.937
How dare you say you love me, if you have
loved me

00:53:35.138 --> 00:53:39.128
you must do all this and you must give
this to me”.

00:53:40.607 --> 00:53:43.550
Oh, we had some Sahaja Yogis like that.

00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:46.340
They were abusing Me also that,
“You said you love us,

00:53:46.541 --> 00:53:49.893
then why don’t You do this for us?”.

00:53:50.422 --> 00:53:53.836
Then it becomes a demanding love.

00:53:55.901 --> 00:53:59.792
Any other question anywhere?

00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:07.099
What’s happening, John, about your
priesthood?

00:54:10.327 --> 00:54:13.756
They are getting quite exposed.
(John: Yes, Mother.)

00:54:13.957 --> 00:54:17.323
Exposure is the only way, but still nothing
goes into the heads of the people,

00:54:17.524 --> 00:54:19.740
they are so egoistical, nobody wants
to accept

00:54:19.941 --> 00:54:23.409
that it’s all exposed now within –
‘No, it is fanaticism, it is nonsense’.

00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:27.076
But still they go on with it, what to do?

00:54:54.243 --> 00:54:57.862
Beautiful children you have here.

00:54:59.074 --> 00:55:02.095
How many are new people who are seeing
Me for the first time?

00:55:02.296 --> 00:55:07.269
Raise your hands please. Ah!

00:55:09.084 --> 00:55:13.423
Ah, you all look little serious!

00:55:14.426 --> 00:55:22.193
Still rather serious. You shouldn’t be
serious at all. Good. Nice.

00:55:33.778 --> 00:55:39.285
Get the children. He is just hitting
the head.

00:55:46.022 --> 00:55:50.643
Who is the child crying there so much?
Whose child?

00:55:50.844 --> 00:55:57.357
(A yogi says something inaudible)
This child? What’s the matter?

00:55:57.558 --> 00:56:02.714
Must be hot. Take out the sweater. Eh?

00:56:04.627 --> 00:56:11.733
(Somebody says something)
It’s alright.

00:56:17.457 --> 00:56:21.905
I think, must be hot for the child.
And they feel very thirsty also,

00:56:22.106 --> 00:56:27.148
you see, these are places where you don’t
have any humidity much,

00:56:27.348 --> 00:56:31.817
so they feel very thirsty also in such
places, I think.

00:56:42.088 --> 00:56:47.720
All of them cry the same, whether they are
Indians, English, anything!

00:56:47.921 --> 00:56:54.000
From their crying you can’t make out
what race they come from.

00:56:57.693 --> 00:57:04.700
Now better? Have you got some water
or something?

00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:10.666
See! You must understand your children,
they won’t cry without a reason.

00:57:10.867 --> 00:57:14.225
They are all realised souls.

00:57:27.074 --> 00:57:32.568
Alright. Thank you, thank you very much.

00:57:35.554 --> 00:57:38.245
Anything else?

00:57:42.346 --> 00:57:49.596
(Someone asks an inaudible question.)

00:57:49.803 --> 00:57:51.875
Shri Mataji: Can you say…?
Yogi: How can you best cope

00:57:52.076 --> 00:57:55.281
if you have to work in a negative situation?
Shri Mataji: In your office?

00:57:55.482 --> 00:57:57.975
Yogi: Job, yes.
Shri Mataji: Negativity in the office?

00:57:58.176 --> 00:58:03.068
Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: You see, all the negativity

00:58:03.269 --> 00:58:09.937
have also, has also an aspect which I call
is ridiculous and humorous;

00:58:10.138 --> 00:58:12.568
so anybody who is negative or anything

00:58:12.769 --> 00:58:15.674
you watch it, see for yourself, don’t get
involved,

00:58:15.875 --> 00:58:22.085
just see which part it is, is it ridiculous
or it is humorous.

00:58:25.290 --> 00:58:28.883
Then you won’t be serious about it.

00:58:37.653 --> 00:58:40.248
Sahaja Yogis have a sense of ridiculous,

00:58:40.449 --> 00:58:43.120
you see, they understand what is
ridiculous is;

00:58:43.321 --> 00:58:48.056
also they understand what is humorous
or what is stupid.

00:58:48.271 --> 00:58:54.040
So just see that, it is stupid? Alright,
let it be, doesn’t matter, what can you do?

00:58:58.167 --> 00:59:00.482
These children are growing so fast,
you know.

00:59:00.683 --> 00:59:03.365
They’re so becoming all tall, girls
and all that.

00:59:03.566 --> 00:59:07.009
I’m just trying to make them out
one after another.
