WEBVTT

00:03.120 --> 00:07.381
I’m just watching all the beauty.

00:12.082 --> 00:15.186
You looked so beautiful at the airport.

00:15.387 --> 00:24.873
Such a joy for me to see you in that shape.

00:26.272 --> 00:28.548
It’s a

00:34.387 --> 00:41.820
rare occasion sometimes

00:42.671 --> 00:53.951
that you feel oneness with the whole
universe,

00:55.246 --> 01:00.237
absolutely oneness with the whole universe,

01:00.438 --> 01:09.357
when you feel the love that exists between
all of you.

01:09.558 --> 01:12.893
It’s the love between you,

01:14.471 --> 01:17.140
oneness between you,

01:17.341 --> 01:23.070
the way you all have opened your heart
to each other

01:24.158 --> 01:30.785
as good human beings, as realized souls,
as saints -

01:30.986 --> 01:45.979
it’s the most fulfilling and satisfying
thing for Me.

01:47.962 --> 01:57.172
When a saint used to meet another
saint, say in India, what would happen?

01:57.982 --> 02:05.841
There was a saint in Maharashtra who was
a tailor, but he was a saint.

02:06.042 --> 02:10.822
Saint is a saint whether he’s a tailor
or he could be anything.

02:11.023 --> 02:16.361
And there was another saint who was
a potter,

02:16.562 --> 02:25.212
who used to make pots, and things like
that, out of clay.

02:26.808 --> 02:39.447
So this saint, Namadeva, went to see
this potter

02:41.053 --> 02:45.945
who was making some pots out of clay.

02:50.050 --> 02:53.073
And he looked at him.

02:55.218 --> 02:59.630
And the feeling that came into his heart
is expressed -

02:59.831 --> 03:06.157
he was a great poet also, Namadeva -
so he says,

03:07.838 --> 03:15.190
in Marathi it is, but I’ll translate it
in English - “I came here

03:17.366 --> 03:23.112
to see the Chaitanya, the formless,

03:23.662 --> 03:28.387
but the formless is standing before me
in the form”.

03:29.134 --> 03:32.386
So to appreciate

03:34.339 --> 03:40.697
the other saint he said, “Now the whole
Chaitanya, the whole

03:43.033 --> 03:47.557
all-pervading power of God’s love has come
in your form before me.

03:47.758 --> 03:50.074
I see it”.

03:51.846 --> 03:55.047
How to address, just think of it.

03:55.248 --> 03:59.392
At that moment, spontaneously he said this.

04:01.235 --> 04:08.118
That is how you are all saints, and saints
have to see that,

04:08.656 --> 04:15.663
that you are the form of that love
of God’s all pervading power.

04:15.864 --> 04:20.193
You are in the form of that, all of you.

04:20.699 --> 04:25.720
I think that day, you were standing
in the rain and sleet

04:25.921 --> 04:29.393
with all your children. For a Mother it’s
too much

04:29.594 --> 04:34.731
to see, such beautiful feelings for me.

04:34.932 --> 04:38.657
But the feelings among yourselves,

04:39.976 --> 04:44.797
the open-heartedness, the Pure love,

04:45.752 --> 04:50.231
that filled the whole atmosphere
with such beauty.

04:50.928 --> 04:53.852
It’s not just talking,

04:55.604 --> 05:02.139
it’s not just writing letters or sending
Birthday cards or something like that;

05:02.340 --> 05:05.118
it’s from the heart,

05:06.383 --> 05:11.204
you have to feel each other that
you are all saints.

05:12.013 --> 05:18.036
You are different people, you have
to support each other,

05:18.705 --> 05:22.010
you have to look after each other, you have
to understand each other

05:22.211 --> 05:26.965
because you are the people of a different
awareness

05:27.166 --> 05:31.918
living among people who are blind,
who can hit you,

05:32.118 --> 05:37.041
they can do some harm to you.

05:42.572 --> 05:46.351
The other day I was reading Gyaneshwara;
can you imagine,

05:46.552 --> 05:50.329
he died at the age of 23 years,

05:51.667 --> 05:55.132
at such an young age as 23 years.

05:55.333 --> 06:01.343
And the Gyaneshwari he wrote was
at the age of 21 years. And what a genius!

06:01.544 --> 06:07.408
I mean, you read it, you just don’t
understand,

06:07.609 --> 06:14.874
how could he penetrate so deep.
He described you all,

06:17.116 --> 06:21.245
as I have told you many-a-times he has
described you

06:21.446 --> 06:35.055
as the oceans of, the walking oceans
of Ambrose - Ambrosia.

06:37.882 --> 06:47.438
Talking trees, and the forest of

06:52.628 --> 07:00.899
the trees of bliss and beauty.

07:01.116 --> 07:03.505
That wherever you’ll go you’ll bless
people.

07:03.725 --> 07:08.211
Wherever you will stand you’ll be
auspicious,

07:08.412 --> 07:12.974
you will create harmony, peace and joy.

07:13.175 --> 07:19.158
That’s your work, that’s your style,
that’s what you are here for.

07:20.553 --> 07:24.441
But beware, you ought to be very careful,

07:24.642 --> 07:28.650
because the surroundings seem to be
quite deceptive

07:28.851 --> 07:31.702
and quite troublesome.

07:32.188 --> 07:40.658
And from that surrounding you are coming
out suddenly into a new surrounding

07:40.859 --> 07:47.259
where you have known what is Divine love,
what is Divinity.

07:48.459 --> 07:54.797
One has to be very careful because
the forces that are negative

07:54.998 --> 08:03.473
are very strong, and working at you
all the time,

08:03.674 --> 08:10.859
because you’ve come from matter, you have
evolved from matter

08:11.880 --> 08:23.834
and it’s easy to go to matter,
to materialism, to the materialistic ideas;

08:28.001 --> 08:33.168
and this materialism takes you
to primitiveness.

08:33.936 --> 08:36.507
All your culture, all your beauty will
drop out

08:36.717 --> 08:43.574
as soon as you take to materialism.
If everything becomes money

08:44.136 --> 08:49.708
there’s no place for God, no place
for love,

08:51.322 --> 08:57.388
no place for beauty or for any graciousness.

09:00.374 --> 09:05.121
Money is for us, we are not for the money.

09:05.322 --> 09:08.495
Money should be at our command.

09:09.674 --> 09:14.994
We don’t have to give up anything for that.

09:18.816 --> 09:25.361
And here then we see the materialism
coming up in a very different way,

09:25.562 --> 09:30.600
very subtle ways, and we do not see it.

09:30.801 --> 09:35.245
When we start saying “my, mine, this is
mine”

09:36.972 --> 09:42.078
then you are slowly drifting towards
materialism.

09:44.424 --> 09:48.060
When you see yourself in the collective,

09:50.232 --> 09:56.570
that’s the only way you can get out
of materialism.

09:56.827 --> 10:00.195
Because you are in reality a collective
being.

10:00.396 --> 10:04.698
You are not an individual that way.

10:04.990 --> 10:09.004
But the matter divides you from each other.

10:11.117 --> 10:13.567
And when you realize

10:13.768 --> 10:18.473
that we are not slaves of matter, matter is
our slave,

10:19.259 --> 10:23.660
we are not going to be dominated
by any matter,

10:25.513 --> 10:29.350
then you can feel that love.

10:31.600 --> 10:35.239
One goes to absurd limits if you take
to materialism;

10:35.440 --> 10:40.631
and everything can be explained in the name
of materialism.

10:42.536 --> 10:48.093
But in the name of Divine how far can you
go and explain?

10:49.229 --> 10:51.136
You have to just enjoy it.

10:51.354 --> 10:56.658
When you enjoy you don’t want to explain
or talk about it, you just want to enjoy.

10:57.809 --> 11:00.837
Divinity is to be enjoyed within and
without.

11:01.038 --> 11:06.605
It’s within you, divinity is within you,
but is to be enjoyed.

11:07.709 --> 11:10.227
That’s only possible if you understand

11:10.428 --> 11:14.866
that you are not going to be dominated
by any matter whatsoever.

11:16.701 --> 11:20.036
I’m sorry I’m here for such a short time,

11:20.237 --> 11:25.575
I wish I could be with you forever, which
I am, I think.

11:27.325 --> 11:30.563
But you have brothers and sisters
everywhere,

11:30.764 --> 11:38.353
the whole world has this message with them.

11:38.554 --> 11:41.451
You, some of you have met them in India.

11:41.652 --> 11:46.290
All the Indians have sent their love
to you, lots of love,

11:46.491 --> 11:49.983
and they didn’t know what to send you
from there, something special;

11:50.184 --> 11:53.510
so they sent Me.

12:05.159 --> 12:09.493
Sometimes I feel all of us should meet
somewhere; all of us

12:09.694 --> 12:13.928
from all over the world, from every corner
of the world, all the great saints

12:14.136 --> 12:19.091
who are in these modern times should meet
each other, talk to each other,

12:19.292 --> 12:27.252
enjoy each other and understand each other.

12:29.023 --> 12:35.744
That’s the time we’ll think that a new era
has started

12:35.945 --> 12:43.879
of love, of trust, of enjoyment of other
human beings.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.835
When you start enjoying another person

12:47.036 --> 12:51.476
then only we can say that you are
in the collective.

12:51.915 --> 12:57.740
Like My finger, if it pains the another one
tries to soothe it,

12:57.948 --> 13:01.793
and I feel the soothing, without feeling
any gratitude

13:01.994 --> 13:07.017
or without feeling any sort of a obligation.

13:08.702 --> 13:14.892
So always I say about collectivity. Those
who cannot be collective,

13:15.093 --> 13:19.650
those who cannot open their hearts,
those who keep aloof,

13:19.851 --> 13:23.862
those who think they are - some of them
might be thinking “We are great Sahaja Yogis

13:24.062 --> 13:27.246
because we are very old Sahaja Yogis,”
some might be thinking

13:27.447 --> 13:32.470
“we are very intelligent”, some that
“we are rich, and poor” and all that,

13:32.671 --> 13:38.989
all these differences should disappear.
Who is crying?

13:45.689 --> 13:49.091
She’s crying? What’s the matter?

13:49.292 --> 13:54.151
(Yogini speaks: “Clapping made him jump”.
Yogi: “The clapping made him jump, Mother”.

13:54.352 --> 13:57.387
Shri Mataji: “And loudly?” Yogi: “The
clapping made the baby jump, Shri Mataji”.

13:57.588 --> 14:00.637
Oh!

14:10.301 --> 14:15.484
One day they’ll all grow up. I was thinking
when they’ll grow up

14:15.685 --> 14:20.189
they’ll clap much more than you will do!

14:22.495 --> 14:26.209
Little more time we need, somehow.

14:26.410 --> 14:31.185
All these great people will be becoming
great Sahaja Yogis

14:31.386 --> 14:39.176
and will give us such a pleasure, such
a joy, such a happiness.

14:40.416 --> 14:45.262
Today I wanted to speak about something,

14:45.851 --> 14:48.290
but I’ll just put it as a question
to you all.

14:48.491 --> 14:52.172
And I would like to have an answer
from you.

14:52.373 --> 14:56.765
You can write to Me and let’s see,
or you can discuss.

14:56.966 --> 15:08.500
That as formerly, as other saints have
said,

15:09.121 --> 15:14.190
that once you get your realization
you are lost,

15:15.325 --> 15:20.737
you can’t speak about it. You can just tell
them by some similes, metaphors,

15:20.962 --> 15:30.881
this, that, but you cannot really give them
the experience by telling them.

15:32.076 --> 15:35.816
And that’s why many saints decided that
after realization

15:36.017 --> 15:40.253
it’s better to disappear. Even Gyaneshwara
took his samadhi,

15:40.454 --> 15:45.409
he went into a room and he died
in that room.

15:46.131 --> 15:51.474
Because they could not say much about it,
they could not tell much about it.

15:51.675 --> 15:54.839
But today that’s not the situation.

15:55.188 --> 16:00.230
Like Kabira has said that,

16:00.431 --> 16:05.378
“When a drop becomes the ocean,
what can you say?”.

16:05.579 --> 16:10.412
You are lost, you are no more there,
you are all finished.

16:10.613 --> 16:14.201
So what has happened in Sahaja Yoga,
today’s Sahaja Yoga,

16:14.402 --> 16:19.032
that we are all talking about it,
experiencing it and enjoying it?

16:19.201 --> 16:23.646
That’s the question for all of the Sahaja
Yogis to solve.

16:30.927 --> 16:34.248
(Smiles and talks to somebody. Name
not clear, sounds like “Elliot”.)

16:34.449 --> 16:37.017
You can explain?

16:39.043 --> 16:41.969
Did you hear My question?

16:42.170 --> 16:46.273
No? You didn’t hear My question

16:47.761 --> 16:51.390
You see, what I said was that formerly

16:51.591 --> 16:56.251
those people who got realisation got lost,
alright?

16:56.493 --> 17:01.391
As you were lost just now into thoughtless
awareness!

17:03.441 --> 17:10.254
But you can come back and you can tell
people, you can talk about it,

17:10.462 --> 17:14.345
and many people disappeared.

17:14.829 --> 17:19.571
Actually, they didn’t want to live after
getting realization for a long time,

17:19.785 --> 17:25.310
because they could not explain, talk
to people about it.

17:25.511 --> 17:30.556
Also they said that, "How can a person
who has no tongue

17:30.757 --> 17:36.922
tell about the taste of the jiggery?",
it’s a kind of sweet.

17:37.106 --> 17:42.951
So there was a problem with them,
all of them had a problem.

17:43.161 --> 17:45.490
But now you don’t have that problem.

17:45.691 --> 17:50.448
So what has happened in Sahaja Yoga
that you have no problem?

17:51.557 --> 17:55.309
So think it over and write to Me, alright?

17:59.942 --> 18:04.923
So I don’t know what to say anymore.

18:07.475 --> 18:10.079
Just we are enjoying our rapport
with each other, isn’t it?

18:10.248 --> 18:14.489
That’s all, sitting down here. Anybody
has any questions?

18:14.690 --> 18:20.200
Anybody who is a new person can ask
a question, would be good idea.

18:25.953 --> 18:29.838
Because these people have no questions now.

18:35.255 --> 18:37.748
Ask Me a question.

18:44.061 --> 18:47.991
(To somebody) I’ve heard the good news. Ah!

18:48.192 --> 18:51.605
Yogi: Shri Mataji, how should we approach
the spreading of Sahaja Yoga?

18:51.806 --> 18:53.739
Shri Mataji: How can we…?
Yogi: How should we approach

18:53.940 --> 18:56.427
the spreading of Sahaja Yoga to new people?

18:56.628 --> 18:59.412
Shri Mataji: What? Another yogi: He said
how should we approach

18:59.613 --> 19:03.957
the spreading of Sahaja Yoga to new people,
to the new people.

19:04.158 --> 19:06.419
How should we express Sahaja Yoga,
Shri Mataji?

19:06.620 --> 19:13.608
Shri Mataji: To them? Now, you see,
you’ll meet three types of new people.

19:13.946 --> 19:16.935
Firstly, those who are yogis,

19:17.136 --> 19:21.533
or you can call them as people
of previous births,

19:21.734 --> 19:26.127
who are already very knowledgeable
and are there,

19:26.328 --> 19:29.369
just they can feel it, this is it;

19:29.570 --> 19:34.184
you won’t have much problem with them,
they’ll know it is so.

19:36.734 --> 19:43.608
To them it’s very obvious, and you’ll be
amazed the way they are there,

19:44.639 --> 19:48.318
how they have taken to it so easily.

19:49.806 --> 19:57.918
Now the second type are the people who
may be still believing, non believing,

19:58.119 --> 20:03.526
maybe some who are doubting, maybe;

20:03.727 --> 20:10.637
or maybe some who are asking questions
about it, quite a lot.

20:11.971 --> 20:17.547
So is not sufficient only for you to get
your realization,

20:18.154 --> 20:23.284
also not sufficient for you that you feel
the vibrations

20:23.484 --> 20:29.457
and that you can give realizations
to others, that won’t help much.

20:30.778 --> 20:38.834
You have to know how to deal with various
types of people.

20:39.035 --> 20:48.090
Like I would say a person who is a,
say, a priest,

20:49.657 --> 20:54.150
who comes to you and wants to talk to you
about God, this, that and all that.

20:54.351 --> 20:57.837
So you must know Bible very well,

20:58.038 --> 21:02.293
and know Bible in the way a Sahaja Yogi
should know.

21:02.494 --> 21:05.053
The other day Rustom telephoned
to tell Me that -

21:05.261 --> 21:13.045
I told him to study Koran because, I said,
Islam means surrender,

21:13.223 --> 21:17.278
but before realisation surrender has
no meaning.

21:17.479 --> 21:19.503
And he’s told Me that it’s written in Koran

21:19.704 --> 21:22.697
that unless and until you are connected
with God

21:22.898 --> 21:28.440
you cannot understand anything what is
written here. It’s clearly said.

21:28.641 --> 21:31.032
Now when the Muslims talk to you,
you can tell them:

21:31.233 --> 21:35.425
“This is written in Koran, are you
connected with God?”.

21:36.329 --> 21:40.056
Now, they might say, “Are you connected?”.

21:42.137 --> 21:46.079
Now, then if you say, “Yes”, then finished!

21:46.936 --> 21:52.841
Then Mr. Ego will come up, you see,
suddenly, and you be careful!

21:54.116 --> 21:59.307
So this subject should be treated
with a barge pole.

21:59.508 --> 22:07.990
Like, such a question if they ask… you see
they will be like that, “Are you that?”.

22:08.191 --> 22:10.368
Like in the beginning they used to ask Me,
“What’s your Father?

22:10.568 --> 22:14.268
What’s your Mother? Who are you?".
This, that, all those things, you see.

22:14.469 --> 22:18.804
So at that time you have to give
an answer to them -

22:20.663 --> 22:25.614
Can you give this lady a chair to sit down?
(Hindi) Sit down.

22:28.327 --> 22:32.873
No… Alright. (Hindi) Sit down... Sit down.

22:40.647 --> 22:47.454
So such a question if you answer
in that manner

22:47.655 --> 22:52.068
you have not been clever enough; you have
to be very clever.

22:54.143 --> 23:01.698
Then you should say, "You see, there are" -
avoid the subject, don’t answer;

23:01.899 --> 23:09.412
you just say, “See, there are descriptions
about a person who is a realised soul”.

23:10.636 --> 23:15.935
Jung has said that you have to become
collectively conscious.

23:17.025 --> 23:18.950
Now, what is collectively conscious?

23:19.151 --> 23:25.932
That is, on your central nervous system
you should be able to feel another person.

23:28.822 --> 23:33.693
Now Jung has said so, it’s a poet.

23:33.894 --> 23:37.785
Then you have got other people to quote:

23:38.230 --> 23:41.352
William Blake you can quote,

23:41.553 --> 23:46.650
you can quote other poets or saints whom
you know,

23:47.101 --> 23:50.760
it depends on what sort of a person
you are dealing with.

23:50.961 --> 23:54.215
But just don’t say, ”Yes, I am
a realised soul”.

23:54.416 --> 23:59.593
People have been crucified, murdered,
poisoned for saying that.

24:00.120 --> 24:04.790
So be careful, put it on somebody else
and say,

24:04.991 --> 24:10.658
“Yes, the signs of a realised soul’s are
like this,

24:11.166 --> 24:14.029
that he has to be collectively conscious”.

24:14.239 --> 24:16.186
First of all that you have read Jung

24:16.387 --> 24:19.665
or you know so much about collective
consciousness itself

24:19.839 --> 24:24.624
will put them right in their own places,
to begin with.

24:24.825 --> 24:28.213
Because you have to be knowledgeable
in these modern times,

24:28.414 --> 24:31.774
and you should be able to communicate.

24:32.835 --> 24:35.343
Just by telling them, “I’m a realized soul,

24:35.544 --> 24:40.128
I have to awaken your Kundalini”, nobody
is going to believe you.

24:40.544 --> 24:46.498
Even in India people don’t believe that
we can give realisation -

24:46.699 --> 24:50.722
although they know about realisation, they
know about Kundalini, they know everything,

24:50.923 --> 24:55.244
but still they cannot believe that we,
like ordinary people,

24:55.445 --> 24:58.496
can give realisation to them.

24:59.707 --> 25:04.307
So in no way you should be diffident,
but try to bring them round

25:04.508 --> 25:08.225
through somebody else, because the human
nature is such,

25:08.426 --> 25:13.404
the one who is living, the one who
is existing, they don’t want to accept.

25:13.605 --> 25:18.893
Whosoever is dead, you see, and written
somewhere, anything, in black and white,

25:19.094 --> 25:23.856
and if you say in this book this is this
written, they’ll accept.

25:24.150 --> 25:27.325
That’s why you have to be knowledgeable,
you must read books

25:27.526 --> 25:33.962
which are supportive of your realisation,
supportive of Sahaja Yoga.

25:34.323 --> 25:38.797
Then only you can talk to them. If you are
just having realisation,

25:38.998 --> 25:42.807
you can give realisation, you have got
vibrations, that won’t work out -

25:43.016 --> 25:50.662
especially in the Western countries where
people are too much here, nothing there.

25:51.526 --> 25:55.516
You have to tell them that we are also
intelligent enough,

25:55.717 --> 26:03.070
and we also understand it with our brains
and logic, what is the truth is.

26:03.271 --> 26:10.178
Then after their realisation, of course,
it’s much easier,

26:10.379 --> 26:16.317
but if you say, "Alright, come along, I
have to give you realisation” - you cannot.

26:17.160 --> 26:20.570
You cannot force them, you cannot - they
have to ask for it,

26:20.771 --> 26:23.359
after all there is a protocol of the Divine
also,

26:23.560 --> 26:25.727
the Divine cannot fall at the feet
of people,

26:25.928 --> 26:30.719
“Oh please, come and have your
realisation!”. No, that’s too much.

26:30.920 --> 26:41.610
But there are ways and ways by which
you can ask people and work it out.

26:41.811 --> 26:45.995
But I must tell you one thing, that all
the Sahaja Yogis before,

26:46.196 --> 26:52.398
they started - I started Sahaja Yoga
in the West and especially in England also,

26:52.599 --> 26:55.602
you see, whenever I talked to them
they were very anxious

26:55.803 --> 27:00.232
how to get more people into Sahaja Yoga,
how to bring more people,

27:00.433 --> 27:04.029
what to do for more people, how to manage.

27:04.230 --> 27:10.408
Or they would think somebody to be
very spiritual or something,

27:10.609 --> 27:12.762
“So, Mother, can I bring that fellow?”.

27:12.963 --> 27:17.779
And he would turn out to be a horrid stuff,
you see. It would burn My hands,

27:17.980 --> 27:22.353
it would burn everything, and I would say,
“Now how do you mean? What made you think

27:22.554 --> 27:25.565
that he is spiritual?”. “Mother, he talks
so much of spirituality”.

27:25.766 --> 27:30.516
That’s not the thing. It is a calibre,
is a inner calibre

27:30.717 --> 27:33.230
a person must have. He may be
an ordinary person,

27:33.431 --> 27:36.569
he may not be earning so much money,
he might be on the street,

27:36.747 --> 27:38.581
but the inner calibre has to be there.

27:38.782 --> 27:44.268
Otherwise, what’s the use of breaking
your head against a wall?

27:44.783 --> 27:51.642
So, this idea of having more and more
is wrong.

27:52.516 --> 27:58.063
But to have people who are of that calibre,

27:58.264 --> 28:04.828
of that quality, and who deserve it.
So many do not deserve it.

28:07.008 --> 28:10.066
So what to do? You cannot just... it’s not
like a barber shop

28:10.282 --> 28:14.637
that you can make the head dressed the way
you like.

28:14.838 --> 28:19.155
The Sahastrara has to open out.

28:20.014 --> 28:24.122
You see, the Kundalini has to come out,
it has to work that way.

28:24.323 --> 28:26.848
You cannot just say, “Alright now,
you got realisation”,

28:27.049 --> 28:30.443
you can’t say that way, all the time
the Kundalini’s falling down,

28:30.644 --> 28:34.323
you should say, “Alright, sorry sir,
I’m sorry”. Finished.

28:34.545 --> 28:40.865
And the more you show as if you are seeking
elections for the votes,

28:41.066 --> 28:44.118
the more they’ll be worse.

28:44.387 --> 28:47.853
If somebody doesn’t get realisation,
well and good!

28:48.054 --> 28:51.340
For example, a lady met Me in a place

28:51.541 --> 29:00.756
and she said, “I want to have realisation”.
I said, “Alright, I’ll try”.

29:02.949 --> 29:06.813
Then she wrote three letters to Me,
sent her photographs and she…

29:07.014 --> 29:09.722
And then she said, “I don’t know why
You don’t write to me,

29:09.922 --> 29:11.931
I’ve been writing to You, this and that,

29:12.133 --> 29:17.775
I know it’s a difficult task to give
a realisation”. “Oh” - so I talked to her -

29:17.976 --> 29:20.978
“Alright, when I come next in June
you can come along”.

29:21.179 --> 29:26.381
But there could be somebody who might be
of that calibre, you can feel it,

29:26.582 --> 29:29.989
you are knowledgeable yourself, you can
feel the vibrations, you can feel it

29:30.190 --> 29:33.160
and you can then take that person
seriously.

29:33.375 --> 29:40.930
So work on the people who are simple,
who have that calibre.

29:41.131 --> 29:46.014
Of course, they could be very much spoilt
also because of seeking,

29:46.198 --> 29:54.704
but if they are intense and sincere then
the best thing is to work it out

29:55.459 --> 30:01.425
with complete assiduity and attention
to such a person.

30:01.626 --> 30:04.930
But if it’s a fashion, you see, because
they are going to many gurus

30:05.131 --> 30:07.179
and they are doing some, lots of guru
shopping,

30:07.380 --> 30:13.431
then you should say, “There’s no shop here,
you can’t pay, first of all, you can’t pay”.

30:15.775 --> 30:21.194
If they understand that, then it’s alright.

30:21.395 --> 30:25.182
Say like one fellow from the BBC came in
and he said,

30:25.383 --> 30:29.091
“We can’t believe in a guru who doesn’t
take any money”.

30:29.292 --> 30:32.253
I said, “Then alright, you go to such
a guru who takes money from you,

30:32.454 --> 30:38.236
I’ve nothing to say”. He said - what did
he say? – “Anglo Saxon brain”.

30:38.437 --> 30:43.049
I don’t know what that brain is specially,
made by God or not?

30:43.250 --> 30:49.566
Cannot understand anyone who can do
such a thing without money.

30:49.796 --> 30:52.996
Such a person you should say, “Alright,
thank you very much, I’m sorry, you see,

30:53.197 --> 30:57.804
you are beyond me, you are too great,
sorry”.

30:58.005 --> 31:02.491
Not hurting the person. But such ideas,
such things if they have there in brains,

31:02.677 --> 31:09.998
you cannot break such a hard nut, can you?
And you should not feel sorry for them.

31:11.461 --> 31:16.111
First see their vibrations, see their
calibre. Calibre is the only way

31:16.312 --> 31:22.886
you can judge how much attention is to be
paid, what is to be done.

31:25.293 --> 31:30.116
For some people it’s so obvious,
so obvious.

31:30.426 --> 31:34.315
And some people go on arguing, arguing
with you.

31:34.516 --> 31:36.988
But all of them now are good Sahaja Yogis

31:37.189 --> 31:40.499
despite the fact they argued quite a lot
with Me to begin with;

31:40.700 --> 31:42.706
now they are very good Sahaja Yogis.

31:42.907 --> 31:46.141
But now time has come for you to have
a quick result,

31:46.342 --> 31:50.398
and you will meet people who will be
very good, I’m sure you’ll meet all of them

31:50.599 --> 31:55.919
who are in England and you, you will be
able to manage them.

31:56.120 --> 31:59.600
Your ways, your methods, your styles
will convince them.

31:59.801 --> 32:02.262
Today, only, Doctor Brian has told Me
that many people

32:02.463 --> 32:05.623
are getting interested now in Sahaja Yoga,
because they can see the change

32:05.824 --> 32:13.821
that comes in, the transformation,
the confidence, everything that they see.

32:14.525 --> 32:19.523
So you should not try to force Sahaja Yoga
on anyone;

32:19.724 --> 32:28.270
it’s better that you see their calibre.
Calibre is very easy to make out.

32:28.471 --> 32:33.316
You just say it and it is there. They know,
yes, that’s it.

32:38.366 --> 32:40.896
Any other question?

32:42.240 --> 32:45.606
Yogini: Shri Mataji, please, could you talk
about simpathy

32:45.807 --> 32:49.495
and compassion towards other Sahaja Yogis

32:49.696 --> 32:53.434
who have problems, who have some negativity
in them, please?

32:53.635 --> 32:56.636
Shri Mataji: I can’t hear. What’s it?
Clearly, I didn’t hear.

32:56.837 --> 33:00.084
You also didn’t hear, I’ve seen.
Yogi: Shri Mataji? Shri Mataji: Ah.

33:00.285 --> 33:02.368
Yogi: Could You speak about sympathy
and compassion

33:02.569 --> 33:08.274
towards other Sahaja Yogis who have
problems with negativity? Shri Mataji: Ah.

33:09.004 --> 33:13.524
Now. Sympathy and compassion;

33:13.753 --> 33:20.057
sympathy doesn’t get involved, then
it’s compassion.

33:21.430 --> 33:25.975
Sympathy. ‘Sym’ means ‘share’, ‘pathy’
means ‘pathos’ –

33:26.176 --> 33:28.866
if you want to share the pathos of another
person

33:29.067 --> 33:30.818
then you are sympathizing with that person.

33:31.019 --> 33:36.442
Now supposing, somebody’s husband is dead
and that person is crying a lot

33:36.643 --> 33:42.041
and you also go and sit down and cry
louder than her.

33:43.072 --> 33:48.061
Then people will ask you, “Did you husband
die or her husband die?”.

33:50.142 --> 33:54.116
“No, no, I am just showing sympathy,
you know”.

33:55.435 --> 34:01.968
This is lip sympathy, of course.
Another is – may be the heartfelt sympathy.

34:04.112 --> 34:09.196
When it is heartfelt then you don’t cry;

34:10.850 --> 34:16.681
then you develop the opposite force

34:17.689 --> 34:21.585
to put that person right. What do you say
to that person?

34:21.786 --> 34:29.573
You should say, “See, now if you are born
you are going to die,

34:29.774 --> 34:33.627
everybody’s going to die, that’s, that’s
the system.

34:33.828 --> 34:37.680
Now, two persons never die together.

34:39.411 --> 34:43.326
This gentleman who has died now,
he’s your husband, alright,

34:43.527 --> 34:48.107
but now if you start crying like this,
he won’t have any peace,

34:48.308 --> 34:54.216
he’ll be hovering round you, and he might
be in limbo

34:54.417 --> 34:59.942
waiting for you to come there, or something
like that.

35:00.371 --> 35:05.674
So no use crying over him, on the contrary,
you should say, “I’m alright,

35:05.875 --> 35:10.178
don’t worry about me, I’m alright,

35:10.379 --> 35:14.276
get your realisation as I have got it".

35:14.610 --> 35:17.201
This is the opposite force that you put.

35:17.402 --> 35:24.116
This is a real, real way of helping
that person.

35:24.965 --> 35:27.840
But the compassion is very different,

35:28.041 --> 35:33.636
compassion just flows, it doesn’t say
anything.

35:34.882 --> 35:43.137
Even you don’t see Me, even if you are
in the hospital, you know I am with you.

35:44.261 --> 35:52.661
It works. Even if you just think of Me,
it works.

35:55.189 --> 36:00.143
Even if you make some mistakes, you know
Mother will forgive.

36:01.225 --> 36:03.573
That’s compassion.

36:03.774 --> 36:07.634
Compassion is just flow, you don’t talk
about it, you don’t say anything.

36:07.835 --> 36:12.972
It just flows and covers you completely.

36:13.800 --> 36:18.265
And you enjoy that. That’s compassion;

36:19.450 --> 36:28.252
it works - sympathy doesn’t work -
compassion works, it soothes you.

36:30.652 --> 36:41.705
It’s a very beautiful touch of love,
affection, kindness, protection.

36:43.136 --> 36:52.164
And you feel so confident that you are
under the protection of the Divine.

36:55.137 --> 37:03.763
So, this compassion has not to be shown
or to be dealt with.

37:03.964 --> 37:07.711
Now supposing, another Sahaja Yogi’s having
a problem.

37:07.912 --> 37:10.171
We have only two problems;

37:10.372 --> 37:15.450
as I say, “How many turns there are
in London? Only two, left or right”.

37:15.651 --> 37:20.196
In the same way, they have two problems:
either left or right.

37:20.742 --> 37:25.829
If it is the left one or the right one.

37:26.030 --> 37:29.083
You know right one you have to beat
with the shoes, that’s all, finished.

37:29.284 --> 37:35.334
You don’t have to go and say anything
to the person, if he has right problems.

37:37.289 --> 37:41.949
Now if he has the left problem what
do you do?

37:42.312 --> 37:47.045
You need not go and talk to that person:
give him a bandhan,

37:47.246 --> 37:49.598
you can burn the name, you can do
what you like.

37:49.799 --> 37:54.428
But you need not face the person, you need
not tell the person that, “I’m helping you,

37:54.629 --> 37:58.316
I’m trying to do something for you”.
That’s wrong, that’s ignorance,

37:58.517 --> 38:05.639
you don’t have to say that; it just works,
it has to work by itself.

38:05.840 --> 38:08.634
But I don’t tell you that I’m going to help
you in any way, do I?

38:08.843 --> 38:19.465
Nothing of the kind. Wherever you are
you know I’m with you, all the time.

38:20.154 --> 38:24.388
In the same way, this compassion will work
whether you are sitting down here,

38:24.589 --> 38:29.234
if you are beating somebody with shoes
that person will come round.

38:29.436 --> 38:34.854
So they have only two problems, one is
the left or the right.

38:35.578 --> 38:41.034
If you try to sympathize with any one
of them you are in trouble.

38:42.631 --> 38:48.797
So best thing is not to directly help them,
but indirectly.

38:50.597 --> 38:56.394
Not to tell them that you are helping,
not even mention it to them;

38:56.595 --> 39:03.756
the concern is the point, the concern
about a person.

39:03.957 --> 39:07.835
Your attention should go there,
your attention is very active.

39:08.036 --> 39:12.502
It’s a very powerful thing you have got,
your attention acts.

39:12.703 --> 39:16.794
Just put your attention to that person,
with a concern,

39:16.971 --> 39:22.695
but no involvement: that is compassion.

39:22.896 --> 39:26.445
You have got it, you have got the power
of compassion

39:26.646 --> 39:31.913
in your attention now, you haven’t used it.

39:32.114 --> 39:38.964
Without taking any credit for it, without
showing it, without confronting it,

39:39.151 --> 39:44.830
just inside yourself you feel it, it will
work out.

39:45.031 --> 39:50.384
But for that you have to cleanse your own
attention, that’s very important.

39:50.585 --> 39:56.072
If your attention is loose type, if your
connection is not alright,

39:56.273 --> 40:02.777
then it won’t work out. But if you have
that kind of an attention

40:02.978 --> 40:13.310
which is silent, which is witnessing, which
is not involved, it’s dynamic, it works!

40:13.519 --> 40:20.421
All of you have to become like Me, I’m sure
you all can,

40:20.906 --> 40:24.846
and achieve that calibre of compassion.

40:25.047 --> 40:31.814
Alright? Do you follow now? Thank you.

40:41.677 --> 40:47.482
Any other question, Hester? No?

40:51.907 --> 40:58.118
Danya has any questions? You never
had them.

40:58.319 --> 41:05.745
Anybody else? Jason? None!

41:07.303 --> 41:10.863
Question-less people, I tell you.

41:18.989 --> 41:26.778
Best way is to enjoy others. Best way is
to enjoy others;

41:26.979 --> 41:33.292
and to enjoy yourself is to laugh
at yourself, that’s the best way.

41:33.524 --> 41:38.947
Address yourself, “You, Mister, now
come along, this is ego, I know.

41:39.148 --> 41:45.137
Ah, that’s it, that’s the one! No no no
no no no no no no, not me!

41:45.338 --> 41:48.252
I’ve had enough of it”.

41:49.355 --> 41:52.644
That’s how you enjoy yourself.

41:55.137 --> 41:58.308
And enjoy others, seeing their good points.

41:58.509 --> 42:05.411
Sweet, sweet things they do, very sweet
things. You don’t have to say anything.

42:05.612 --> 42:09.130
And we had 71 marriages, you can’t
believe it.

42:09.331 --> 42:13.818
And I looked at the brides and they were
all looking at Me from the angles, you see;

42:14.003 --> 42:20.364
and the eyes were telling the story
of their love and gratitude,

42:20.565 --> 42:23.860
and I don’t know what all they said.

42:24.061 --> 42:27.371
I was just watching them when they
were walking

42:27.572 --> 42:31.003
with their garlands in their hands,
slowly, slowly;

42:31.204 --> 42:40.288
the sweetness, the beauty of their
feelings; very slowly they were walking.

42:40.520 --> 42:49.077
And then I saw the boys standing there,
looking at Me

42:50.262 --> 42:55.062
with tremendous feeling of oneness.

42:56.420 --> 43:00.223
You see, this cannot be enjoyed otherwise.

43:00.424 --> 43:03.896
Even with the body you cannot enjoy,
supposing you rub your hand,

43:04.097 --> 43:13.788
you won’t enjoy that much as you enjoy
other people, other sahaja yogis.

43:15.457 --> 43:21.243
And then the friends doing the leg-pulling
also I enjoy,

43:21.626 --> 43:26.473
the way they talk to each other I enjoy,
everything’s so enjoyable,

43:26.674 --> 43:31.488
it doesn’t hurt anyone, it doesn’t trouble
anyone.

43:32.864 --> 43:39.180
You are here to enjoy, God has created
this universe for you to enjoy.

43:39.634 --> 43:43.920
So only thing is that you must improve
your attention,

43:44.121 --> 43:48.150
cleanse your attention by meditation,

43:49.365 --> 43:54.661
always think of good things, not of bad
things.

43:55.474 --> 43:59.518
You should not react too much, just be
within yourself,

43:59.719 --> 44:02.717
see for yourself, witness everything.

44:02.918 --> 44:09.153
And you’ll be amazed, you’ll see beautiful
points, beautiful things all around you.

44:09.354 --> 44:17.530
So much of beauty which we are losing
because we cannot see it.

44:18.083 --> 44:22.644
So that deep, penetrating attention
of concern

44:22.828 --> 44:26.443
will solve all the problems, I’m sure.

44:29.759 --> 44:32.941
But ‘open your heart’ doesn’t mean that
you go and hug somebody

44:33.142 --> 44:35.697
and kiss somebody ten times, it doesn’t
mean that at all.

44:35.890 --> 44:40.196
On the contrary, it can be quite
embarrassing, you know?

44:45.526 --> 44:48.698
Any other questions?

45:01.450 --> 45:07.239
I, I had a problem there, you see, we,
they arranged a programme for Me

45:07.440 --> 45:11.211
to speak to the young presidents’
organisation,

45:11.412 --> 45:16.916
the presidents of big, big – of big, big
organisations,

45:17.138 --> 45:20.750
business organisations, and I had to speak
to them.

45:20.951 --> 45:25.201
And one of the lady - of course, I mean -
the questions were

45:25.402 --> 45:28.090
very good and everything flowing (?) over,
and later on she says,

45:28.291 --> 45:33.110
“But I can’t believe it, because she is
not at all serious, you see”.

45:34.684 --> 45:36.962
And I laughed and laughed and laughed
with that, I said,

45:37.163 --> 45:41.428
“Now I cannot be serious anymore,
that was too much”.

45:42.275 --> 45:45.954
When there’s so much joy bubbling out, why,
how can you be serious?

45:46.155 --> 45:50.920
This is the idea of a saint that he should
be very serious, stern,

45:51.121 --> 45:58.360
going out with a stick in his hand
all the time hitting everyone on the head.

46:01.355 --> 46:06.537
So, any other question (indistinct word)?
No.

46:12.034 --> 46:13.690
We must have a hall here, big hall

46:13.891 --> 46:19.037
we should buy somewhere, we should be
able to buy.

46:19.434 --> 46:22.486
I’m thankful to people who are working
on Shudy Camp but I think

46:22.687 --> 46:25.012
you must hurry up now,

46:25.213 --> 46:29.327
people are coming for Guru Puja, I told
them we’ll have it in Shudy Camp.

46:29.528 --> 46:32.463
And otherwise if it is not ready we’ll have
to change the venue,

46:32.664 --> 46:36.269
so everybody must go and work it out,
I think, is important.

46:36.470 --> 46:40.308
We have money, we have no problem on that.

46:40.662 --> 46:45.813
We have to have a nice, grand, beautiful

46:47.031 --> 46:51.257
seminar before Guru Puja. And there are
many coming here,

46:51.458 --> 46:58.653
you’ll meet all of them, will be a very
nice time, real festival we’ll be having.

46:59.153 --> 47:03.672
So it would be better that you, all of you
combine together and work it out

47:03.873 --> 47:09.348
and also give different work to different
people;

47:09.549 --> 47:15.908
and they should all try to organize it
in a beautiful way

47:16.109 --> 47:19.929
that there’s no quarrel, nothing.
But you’ll see people, you see, will say,

47:20.138 --> 47:24.917
“Oh! This is the room I would like to have
for my wife”, things like that.

47:25.118 --> 47:28.137
Sounds stupidity.

47:29.595 --> 47:33.888
“This is the glass for me, I can’t give it
to you”.

47:34.158 --> 47:38.704
All such stupid things will be there, and
I think, for such people you should say,

47:38.905 --> 47:43.049
“You are not for Guru Puja, better not
be here”.

47:43.750 --> 47:47.649
Everybody doesn’t deserve to be there.

47:48.771 --> 47:51.771
That’s you should find out, that what sort
of people they are.

47:51.972 --> 47:55.114
If they are fighting for all these little,
little things it’s best is to tell them

47:55.315 --> 47:59.653
that, “Sorry, you’d better not come
for Guru Puja”.

48:05.916 --> 48:09.663
So, the most important thing is that
in Guru Puja we have to receive

48:09.864 --> 48:15.200
a special capacity to be a guru ourselves.

48:15.401 --> 48:19.815
A special intelligence, a special
understanding,

48:20.000 --> 48:23.818
a kind of a wisdom which gives you
discretion

48:24.019 --> 48:27.810
and the ability to argue out things.

48:28.950 --> 48:32.347
That will enhance your personality,

48:32.942 --> 48:42.507
a beautiful, dignified personality can be
created within yourselves,

48:42.708 --> 48:46.756
so for that you have to be there

48:46.957 --> 48:52.759
with all that dedication and understanding
about yourself.

48:54.565 --> 48:58.769
So I’m looking forward to this Guru Puja,
and everybody has to write.

48:58.970 --> 49:04.216
Now for Sahastrara day they are working
so hard, the people from Australia

49:04.417 --> 49:07.993
have printed so many posters, all over
the world they have sent it,

49:08.194 --> 49:11.899
they have sent it to you also the posters
of Sahastrar Day - have you brought it?

49:12.100 --> 49:15.298
No? You haven’t shown them.

49:23.086 --> 49:25.941
So next time you must show all of them,
they should see that,

49:26.174 --> 49:29.521
what they have done, how much; and
you must -

49:29.722 --> 49:32.897
we have no, nothing like a news from there
and this thing - but all this

49:33.098 --> 49:35.866
can be discussed among yourself; and you
should know about each other,

49:36.067 --> 49:39.147
what’s happening, where, and what ashram
is doing,

49:39.348 --> 49:45.375
what is the special work they are doing, and
what is the new thing they have discovered;

49:45.576 --> 49:51.017
all sorts of things you can find out from
each other. And you can tell others also.

49:51.218 --> 49:55.465
This is how you keep in communication
with each other.

49:55.666 --> 49:59.668
Oh, there’s a very good news, that
Doctor Rai,

49:59.869 --> 50:05.371
who is the Dean of the Faculty
of Physiology in Delhi University,

50:05.572 --> 50:11.650
started a research work on the comparative
study of Sahaja Yogis and others

50:11.851 --> 50:15.678
as far as the physiology is concerned.
And he’s found out that the people

50:15.879 --> 50:26.132
who are not Sahaja Yogis have a very low
resistance for diseases,

50:26.333 --> 50:29.875
their skin, skin resistance is less and
so many things he’s found out.

50:30.076 --> 50:33.529
And he has put it on, he’s tabulated
the whole thing,

50:33.730 --> 50:38.249
and that is been now approved
by the Government and is now published,

50:38.450 --> 50:42.025
going to be published also.
In the same way, you see,

50:42.226 --> 50:47.172
we are thinking of having a research here
done for people in Shudy Camp,

50:47.373 --> 50:50.429
so that we can also publish something
like that with the research.

50:50.630 --> 50:53.972
That so far, you see, so many have been
cured, so many got rid

50:54.173 --> 50:58.100
of their addictions, so many got rid
of their mental problems,

50:58.301 --> 51:01.501
so many things happened; but we haven’t
yet recorded it,

51:01.702 --> 51:05.707
we have not put it properly on the record.
Now this is what we are going to do now,

51:05.908 --> 51:09.686
anybody who has achieved something
or has felt better

51:09.887 --> 51:12.221
or has been cured or something like that

51:12.422 --> 51:15.683
must give it in writing to these people
so they record it,

51:15.884 --> 51:21.021
because, you see, in these modern times
they want everything in black and white,

51:21.222 --> 51:24.239
so that could be done very well here
in England.

51:24.440 --> 51:26.985
Another thing I was thinking that now
“Nirmala Yoga”

51:27.186 --> 51:31.925
has stopped there because of this problem
of foreign exchange.

51:32.134 --> 51:37.480
So what we can do is to have
a “Nirmala Yog” published in India

51:37.681 --> 51:42.159
and sent here, and you can print it here
and sell it here,

51:42.360 --> 51:44.570
so that the foreign exchange problem
doesn’t come in.

51:44.778 --> 51:46.961
Because foreign exchange is such a problem
in that country,

51:47.162 --> 51:52.829
you have to have a proper committee,
this, that, all headaches.

51:53.030 --> 51:57.136
So you can sell them here and distribute
them here,

51:57.336 --> 52:01.348
it’s very easy, and Paul can help you
there. Paul, can’t you? (Paul: Yes...)

52:01.549 --> 52:05.892
Yes. So it’s alright. We get
the “Nirmala Yog” done there

52:06.093 --> 52:09.054
and just the copy sent here, translated.

52:09.255 --> 52:12.168
You can also add to it, you can also put
something into it

52:12.369 --> 52:14.588
and some things from there and some
things from here;

52:14.789 --> 52:21.278
you can distribute it to all the centres
here and we can start like that.

52:21.478 --> 52:25.094
Because they created a big problem
out of that last “Nirmala Yoga”,

52:25.296 --> 52:28.924
I’ve just stopped it, because you see we,
we are not very good

52:29.125 --> 52:33.602
at human laws, I think, sometimes you make
mistakes and I don’t want

52:33.810 --> 52:38.051
you people to be caught up into these human
laws. So you have to be careful.

52:38.252 --> 52:42.960
And we can do it, I think we can do it.
And as England is the heart

52:43.161 --> 52:46.479
it has to circulate everything.

52:49.187 --> 52:54.454
But the hearts must open out.
The conditioning is very bad here,

52:54.655 --> 52:59.255
you see, that you are told that you should
not express your feelings,

52:59.456 --> 53:02.760
you should not say anything, you should be
very poised,

53:02.961 --> 53:07.635
you should not talk about your feelings.
That’s not so in Sahaja Yoga.

53:07.836 --> 53:11.769
This is the heart and heart must speak,
heart must say;

53:11.970 --> 53:17.037
you must know how to say that you love
others. It’s very easy to say ‘I hate’,

53:17.238 --> 53:23.465
but it’s very difficult for people to say
‘I love you’. Because they are afraid,

53:23.666 --> 53:26.754
that if you commit like this, “Oh, so
you love me?

53:26.955 --> 53:31.537
So do this for me. You love me?
So do this for me.

53:32.606 --> 53:34.937
How dare you say you love me, if you have
loved me

53:35.138 --> 53:39.128
you must do all this and you must give
this to me”.

53:40.607 --> 53:43.550
Oh, we had some Sahaja Yogis like that.

53:43.750 --> 53:46.340
They were abusing Me also that,
“You said you love us,

53:46.541 --> 53:49.893
then why don’t You do this for us?”.

53:50.422 --> 53:53.836
Then it becomes a demanding love.

53:55.901 --> 53:59.792
Any other question anywhere?

54:00.870 --> 54:07.099
What’s happening, John, about your
priesthood?

54:10.327 --> 54:13.756
They are getting quite exposed.
(John: Yes, Mother.)

54:13.957 --> 54:17.323
Exposure is the only way, but still nothing
goes into the heads of the people,

54:17.524 --> 54:19.740
they are so egoistical, nobody wants
to accept

54:19.941 --> 54:23.409
that it’s all exposed now within –
‘No, it is fanaticism, it is nonsense’.

54:23.610 --> 54:27.076
But still they go on with it, what to do?

54:54.243 --> 54:57.862
Beautiful children you have here.

54:59.074 --> 55:02.095
How many are new people who are seeing
Me for the first time?

55:02.296 --> 55:07.269
Raise your hands please. Ah!

55:09.084 --> 55:13.423
Ah, you all look little serious!

55:14.426 --> 55:22.193
Still rather serious. You shouldn’t be
serious at all. Good. Nice.

55:33.778 --> 55:39.285
Get the children. He is just hitting
the head.

55:46.022 --> 55:50.643
Who is the child crying there so much?
Whose child?

55:50.844 --> 55:57.357
(A yogi says something inaudible)
This child? What’s the matter?

55:57.558 --> 56:02.714
Must be hot. Take out the sweater. Eh?

56:04.627 --> 56:11.733
(Somebody says something)
It’s alright.

56:17.457 --> 56:21.905
I think, must be hot for the child.
And they feel very thirsty also,

56:22.106 --> 56:27.148
you see, these are places where you don’t
have any humidity much,

56:27.348 --> 56:31.817
so they feel very thirsty also in such
places, I think.

56:42.088 --> 56:47.720
All of them cry the same, whether they are
Indians, English, anything!

56:47.921 --> 56:54.000
From their crying you can’t make out
what race they come from.

56:57.693 --> 57:04.700
Now better? Have you got some water
or something?

57:05.660 --> 57:10.666
See! You must understand your children,
they won’t cry without a reason.

57:10.867 --> 57:14.225
They are all realised souls.

57:27.074 --> 57:32.568
Alright. Thank you, thank you very much.

57:35.554 --> 57:38.245
Anything else?

57:42.346 --> 57:49.596
(Someone asks an inaudible question.)

57:49.803 --> 57:51.875
Shri Mataji: Can you say…?
Yogi: How can you best cope

57:52.076 --> 57:55.281
if you have to work in a negative situation?
Shri Mataji: In your office?

57:55.482 --> 57:57.975
Yogi: Job, yes.
Shri Mataji: Negativity in the office?

57:58.176 --> 58:03.068
Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: You see, all the negativity

58:03.269 --> 58:09.937
have also, has also an aspect which I call
is ridiculous and humorous;

58:10.138 --> 58:12.568
so anybody who is negative or anything

58:12.769 --> 58:15.674
you watch it, see for yourself, don’t get
involved,

58:15.875 --> 58:22.085
just see which part it is, is it ridiculous
or it is humorous.

58:25.290 --> 58:28.883
Then you won’t be serious about it.

58:37.653 --> 58:40.248
Sahaja Yogis have a sense of ridiculous,

58:40.449 --> 58:43.120
you see, they understand what is
ridiculous is;

58:43.321 --> 58:48.056
also they understand what is humorous
or what is stupid.

58:48.271 --> 58:54.040
So just see that, it is stupid? Alright,
let it be, doesn’t matter, what can you do?

58:58.167 --> 59:00.482
These children are growing so fast,
you know.

59:00.683 --> 59:03.365
They’re so becoming all tall, girls
and all that.

59:03.566 --> 59:07.009
I’m just trying to make them out
one after another.
