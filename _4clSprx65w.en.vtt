00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:13.126
Now at Hamsa Chakra, this understanding must come

00:00:13.126 --> 00:00:19.926
that you must balance both the nadis, 
the left and the right.

00:00:19.926 --> 00:00:25.693
Now to balance the left and the right,
the best way is to do some breathing,

00:00:25.693 --> 00:00:33.293
is to take the air through one nostril
and keep it waiting here for a while

00:00:33.293 --> 00:00:36.059
and then allow it to go out of the other.

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.959
Then you breathe in with this one,

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:42.259
allow it to stay here for a while and
then allow it to go down.

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:45.459
But it is to be done very slowly.

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:49.459
Not in a hurry, not too much.
 Only thrice.

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:51.559
Best thing as I’ve told you is neti.

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.813
If not that, another thing I have seen

00:00:53.893 --> 00:00:58.392
that those inhalers, you see that you get, are very good.

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:07.926
The neti thing that I’ve given you.
 If you fill the water below the spout and fill it,

00:01:07.926 --> 00:01:13.359
put in some two, three drops of one of those things
that you get for inhaling

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:19.626
and put that neti thing in one nose only,
and with another nose it goes up.

00:01:19.626 --> 00:01:23.259
Then you come, bring it here, it goes up and clears it out.

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.079
It’s a very good thing.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:31.107
If you do it every night before sleeping, in 
three, four days you’ll be absolutely cleared out.

00:01:31.812 --> 00:01:36.400
But the main thing is: it comes because 
of imbalances in our temperaments.
