00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:22.580
now you should see there is no data on

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:31.910
the hamsa chakra but it is the formless

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:41.059
energy of so many organs which are

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:43.480
looked after by Buddha Mahavira Christ

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:49.329
Shri Krishna

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:51.980
four of them managed by Shri Ganesha

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.890
so these genetics are put by Shri

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:59.390
Ganesha because he is the source of

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:06.500
wisdom so first once they spoil their

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:09.670
more adhara the wisdom is finished base

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.250
is the fundamentals are finished

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:18.830
that's why immoral life is very

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:25.959
detrimental to our life because we lose

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.959
our discretion the discretion is lost

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:39.149
then if you can awaken Shri Ganesha in

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:42.030
the hamsa chakra then suddenly you

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:47.369
belong to the higher race of sahaja

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:50.539
Yogi's it's surprising I have seen

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.189
people overnight give up their drugs

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:57.329
very immoral people become extremely

00:01:53.189 --> 00:02:01.229
modern because of this chakra being

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:06.770
suddenly awakened and the light of the

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:12.780
Spirit is best expressed through this

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:17.340
chakra in everyday life in the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:23.370
collective life also one start then

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:25.769
seeing the point as we say like now in

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.760
sahaja yoga we have different problems

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:32.790
also say when people first come to

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.810
sahaja yoga they start watching other

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:41.310
people and starting finding their faults

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:43.850
what's wrong with them they never see

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.739
what they are here for they are not here

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.889
to find out falls for the dots but to

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.930
correct your own defense so they say oh

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:54.090
this man is no good that man is no good

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.319
this is wrong they start creating

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.329
problems they'll talk to each other

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.030
saying oh this man is not good that man

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:08.280
is not go try to create groups and

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:15.530
things they are here talk for what or

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.530
create a politics or for your ascent

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.580
some of them if they do not do all this

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.620
then they think we should start to make

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:31.350
some money out of it or some sort of a

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:36.970
thing or some start criticizing others

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:39.180
about something which is not their

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.180
concern

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.970
so they forget because they're just now

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.970
coming to sahaja yoga and their genetics

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:54.860
are not established of their wisdom they

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:58.490
start worrying about things which are

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:04.430
not their worry which they should not

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:08.930
bother about then some of them start

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:12.320
thinking oh I am the leader or why am I

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.620
not the leader so they start finding

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.799
fault with the leadership sometimes

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:22.660
leader also can few know who I am the

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.660
leader I can be very stern very

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:30.919
disciplinarian I can control people I

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:36.440
can do this they have come here to learn

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:47.350
how to love to be compassionate to be

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:55.900
tolerant the sense of leadership and

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:55.900
also of obedience both hard is Krishna

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:02.180
if somebody says something to you and if

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:08.720
you obey that person for your

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:12.310
benevolence you will subtle certainly

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:15.590
understand that it is for your good if

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:18.530
some leader says that this is wrong with

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:23.600
you try to see if it is wrong instead of

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:24.350
feeling hurt about it yes it is wrong so

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.780
what should I do

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.550
how can I improve myself ask the leader

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.470
or you can write to me or do anything

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.090
but no they will not do it immediately

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.370
they write their letter to me saying

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:37.910
this leader is such a such bad fellow

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:44.090
he's so this they ate that money he ate

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:45.890
that thing and all kinds of or else they

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.990
may tell people Oh mother listens to

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.400
this fellow he is no good he is just

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.569
stunning mother story he's a mother

00:05:49.400 --> 00:06:00.589
raises her mother is not such a fool

00:05:53.569 --> 00:06:03.349
she knows about everything so all these

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:05.719
things that we have gathered from our

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:08.270
previous life even after our second

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:10.399
birth we carried little bit like an egg

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.249
becomes a bird but still lots of things

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:17.300
of the egg are hanging onto his body so

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:19.309
you have to cleanse it so at this point

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:22.399
when you have got your realization the

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:26.719
first discussion should be how am I

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:32.149
going to achieve that state of spirit

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:35.209
the pure spirit instead of that also

00:06:32.149 --> 00:06:45.169
people get lost because they have no

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:47.269
discussion with this enlightenment first

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:50.719
thing that happens I've seen with people

00:06:47.269 --> 00:06:55.749
their eyes are fixed they don't roll

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:55.749
their eyes much now they have very

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:04.610
innocent eyes otherwise they are really

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:06.649
mad those people who go on looking at

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.969
everything like this circus is there's

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:10.879
no difference between the mad man and

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:13.699
him we put one mad man he does the same

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:18.729
and a person who is like that does the

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:21.919
same and it's such a crazy thing to do

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:25.729
but immediately I mean it is such a

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:30.129
spontaneous thing it's like the light

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:32.329
coming in the room it is so spontaneous

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:35.499
that you start seeing things clearly

00:07:32.329 --> 00:07:35.499
don't know this is not

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:43.470
before in the garden you would go and

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:47.060
collect all the thorns and put them in

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:52.140
your body if that was the situation

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:55.290
never looked at the flowers and suddenly

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:57.030
after realization you'd be amazed you

00:07:55.290 --> 00:08:00.180
just see flowers and don't bother about

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:06.210
thoughts or if you find you take them

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:09.060
out there is joy even before realization

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:14.850
and after realization but there's no

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:19.380
capacity to enjoy that capacity comes to

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:25.580
you after realization and the main thing

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:28.290
that happens to you is the discretion

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:35.670
then like this one you just take the

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:39.540
milk of everything but everything your

00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:43.470
attitude becomes very different start

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:48.320
seeing things in a different angle like

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:53.640
once we had to go to one very ancient

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:55.980
temple to see some art be my son-in-law

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:59.760
and my daughter we were walking about we

00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:01.620
had to walk for miles up the hill and

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:05.640
they were very tired so we went into one

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:08.160
temple and just played on horses they

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:11.060
were so tired at that time I say see

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:15.000
this elephant see how beautiful they are

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:23.010
every one has a different type of a tail

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:25.170
and a different type of a trunk the pose

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:28.440
is are different so many of them are

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:30.450
like that my son-in-law said Baba we are

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:35.310
so tired how are you looking at these

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:38.480
things because attention didn't go to my

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:42.650
tiredness but to those beautiful days

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:47.280
same thing you start sucking in the milk

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:51.000
there is joy but you cannot feel the joy

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:54.750
because the power that subtle power

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.819
of divine discretion is not there once

00:09:54.750 --> 00:10:01.319
that comes in you start enjoying

00:09:56.819 --> 00:10:06.540
everything it's just the same life is

00:10:01.319 --> 00:10:11.879
just the same nothing has changed same

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:16.069
house same family same city same

00:10:11.879 --> 00:10:22.139
environment but you start enjoying

00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:25.529
because the sensitivity of your hamsa

00:10:22.139 --> 00:10:28.230
chakra is now only for divine discretion

00:10:25.529 --> 00:10:30.800
and you immediately know and then you

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:35.100
don't want to do anything with the

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:37.050
thorns only want to gather flowers and

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:41.790
you know how to gather flowers and you

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:48.930
are in joy so the light of the Spirit

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:53.730
which shines through your I'm such a

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:56.129
tree gives you wisdom wisdom doesn't

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:58.230
mean that you know how to argue things

00:10:56.129 --> 00:11:04.920
or you fight with people no it doesn't

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:09.529
mean that wisdom means how you take to

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:14.309
the good side of everything to enjoy it

00:11:09.529 --> 00:11:18.839
this is wisdom and that you avoid all

00:11:14.309 --> 00:11:22.230
destructive things and take to something

00:11:18.839 --> 00:11:25.889
constructive now you are going to say on

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:30.689
a road and is written that there's

00:11:25.889 --> 00:11:32.250
danger before realization they words all

00:11:30.689 --> 00:11:35.519
right let's see what is dangerous they

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:38.970
jump into it and say that we have what

00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:42.209
they wanna by killing themselves such

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:47.939
explanations but a sensible man is on

00:11:42.209 --> 00:11:53.300
our danger cope what's the after he

00:11:47.939 --> 00:11:56.399
preserves himself he respects his life

00:11:53.300 --> 00:12:00.870
because he knows now he has become the

00:11:56.399 --> 00:12:03.050
instrument of God so we stop comes to

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:03.050
you

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:10.990
automatically but through experience

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:13.310
then you know this is the right path

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:16.850
through experience you start

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:19.759
understanding nowadays I am telling all

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:21.560
these things to you say if 20 years back

00:12:19.759 --> 00:12:23.600
I never talked of these things to them

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.430
because I knew if I start talking

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:28.160
they'll say oh she's talking something

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:32.170
out of the blue god knows if it is true

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:36.139
or not but once the wisdom becomes

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:40.550
transparent and you start seeing through

00:12:36.139 --> 00:12:45.980
it everything very clearly makes your

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:48.589
mind absolutely clear then anybody who

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:51.529
does things of wisdom you know feel bad

00:12:48.589 --> 00:12:55.040
about it on the contrary you thank that

00:12:51.529 --> 00:12:59.509
I'm so lucky that I can hear about these

00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:03.560
things such nice things and also those

00:12:59.509 --> 00:13:08.029
sayings start giving you joy so with the

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:10.009
ear you hear so many things used to hear

00:13:08.029 --> 00:13:13.100
the same things might be hearing so much

00:13:10.009 --> 00:13:14.439
music everything before also but never

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:18.769
gave you joy

00:13:14.439 --> 00:13:20.899
now because of this transformation the

00:13:18.769 --> 00:13:26.240
same music which you heard before now

00:13:20.899 --> 00:13:29.319
makes you feel as if you are in a

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:32.509
seventh heaven it gives you extra see

00:13:29.319 --> 00:13:36.439
the poetry which was quite mundane

00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:38.149
ordinary people told me mother it was

00:13:36.439 --> 00:13:41.600
such a headache to read William Blake in

00:13:38.149 --> 00:13:44.930
those days but now we love it we read it

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:50.660
like Bible because now you develop you

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:53.930
cite new hearing power all these are

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:56.089
called in son sir the a-team Rhea means

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:59.449
the organs which are subtle organs

00:13:56.089 --> 00:14:02.750
within us so eyes have a subtle organ

00:13:59.449 --> 00:14:08.019
years have a subtle organ and these

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:08.019
settle out and then start everything

00:14:08.139 --> 00:14:15.329

holding each other's hand

00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:46.959
supposing it is very hot then every

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:49.779
somebody says people may start I don't

00:14:46.959 --> 00:14:52.839

00:14:49.779 --> 00:14:54.670

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:05.920
aspect which is supposed to be very very

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:08.790
bad for others to you you know the

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:11.769
aspect of that what is to be enjoyed

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:17.800
that part which is to be enjoyed

00:15:11.769 --> 00:15:21.209
and once you know how to do it then you

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:25.949
say we are swimming in the ocean of joy

00:15:21.209 --> 00:15:32.529
the ocean is the same but now you are

00:15:25.949 --> 00:15:37.389
just touching those beautiful drops from

00:15:32.529 --> 00:15:42.220
Rosia which are in that ocean and the

00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:46.029
rest are worried of getting drowned same

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:51.959
ocean same world that's why they say

00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:55.470

00:16:02.079 --> 00:16:10.000

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:17.250
his things to watch and he is the one

00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:19.199

00:16:19.199 --> 00:16:25.910
he is very nicely secured he's got

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:28.579

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000
is dropped in the ocean but the one who

00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:50.180

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:10.189

00:17:10.189 --> 00:17:18.289
everything even if somebody is shouting

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:20.270
or saying something in a Hall I've seen

00:17:18.289 --> 00:17:23.390

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:37.270

so the whole attitude of life is so

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:51.250
changed because of this hamsa chakra and

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:54.820
you are not even aware that you have

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:59.130
developed that wisdom automatically then

00:17:54.820 --> 00:18:03.660
you start also consolidating it and

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:09.250
making it your own enlightened faith

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:14.430
because every time you see whatever you

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:14.430
believe in just works out
