1
00:29:13,998 --> 00:29:17,908
I have been telling them that

2
00:29:18,472 --> 00:29:22,565
 the style of Indian knowledge

3
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:25,818
 is very different from the Western mind.

4
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,789
In the West, you see, if you say something,

5
00:29:29,814 --> 00:29:34,730
then they want to have an experimental approval.

6
00:29:34,947 --> 00:29:41,041
They will go to the scientists or to other
people who are equipped

7
00:29:41,066 --> 00:29:46,189
with knowledge to know what they said
in these books is true or not.

8
00:29:46,214 --> 00:29:47,986
They will even judge Christ.

9
00:29:48,011 --> 00:29:51,582
They would even judge Moses.

10
00:29:51,607 --> 00:29:53,359
They would judge everybody

11
00:29:53,384 --> 00:29:58,409
as if they are the most intelligent
and the most capable people.

12
00:29:59,305 --> 00:30:02,756
And they write books after books against them

13
00:30:03,741 --> 00:30:09,558
disclosing as if they are those people
who have said something,

14
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:13,189
have said out of their
minds or something.

15
00:30:14,001 --> 00:30:18,406
It is never accepted normally

16
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:22,647
and if it is accepted they become absolutely fanatics.

17
00:30:22,672 --> 00:30:29,395
So, now according to Indian style of

18
00:30:29,943 --> 00:30:35,549
understanding is that first of all if a great Rishi

19
00:30:35,574 --> 00:30:37,983
 or great Muni or a great...

20
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:41,670
you can call a saint has
said something,

21
00:30:42,099 --> 00:30:47,990
then he has said it, while you have to just listen to that

22
00:30:49,323 --> 00:30:52,100
 because you are not equally the same.

23
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:58,470
Whatever he has said is his own experience,
his own knowledge

24
00:30:58,762 --> 00:31:02,833
 and you have no business to judge him or to say

25
00:31:02,858 --> 00:31:07,235
 this is not true, that is not true.

26
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,328
You accept it

27
00:31:10,489 --> 00:31:15,504
and once you get your self-realization,
it is clearly written down

28
00:31:16,131 --> 00:31:19,405
after self-realization,
you have to grow.

29
00:31:19,901 --> 00:31:26,045
Grow into perfect being and then you can see
for yourself

30
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:31,011
what he has said or they have said is the truth.

31
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,101
So the approach is different.

32
00:31:34,288 --> 00:31:37,955
In one way if you start going through science,

33
00:31:38,043 --> 00:31:41,941
through this, through that, you cannot reach anywhere

34
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:44,815
 and moreover your growth is stunted.

35
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:50,667
So, what you have to do is to go to this knowledge

36
00:31:51,177 --> 00:31:54,681
through believing in what they have said.

37
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:57,706
Whatever Christ has said, you have to believe,

38
00:31:58,198 --> 00:32:01,245
whatever Mohammad has said, you have to believe,

39
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:05,103
whatever Guru Nanak has said,
you have to believe,

40
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:09,605
whatever Gyandeva has said, you have to believe,

41
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,967
Lao Tse you have to believe: like that.

42
00:32:11,992 --> 00:32:16,699
Because you are not of that spiritual level.

43
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:18,901
So accept it.

44
00:32:19,329 --> 00:32:23,147
Now do not try to analyze it.
Everything you try to analyze

45
00:32:23,218 --> 00:32:26,269
and in that analysis you get lost.

46
00:32:27,004 --> 00:32:32,292
So once you are a realized soul of that level

47
00:32:32,649 --> 00:32:37,546
and then you grow into your fullness

48
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,014
what we call sampurna --

49
00:32:40,364 --> 00:32:44,249
 then only you will know whether whatever they have

50
00:32:44,274 --> 00:32:48,381
said is true or not and then you can find out.

51
00:32:48,814 --> 00:32:54,033
It is very easy, then, to know whatever is
said is true or not.

52
00:32:55,594 --> 00:33:01,380
For Sahaja Yogis now is very easy to find
out if something is real or unreal,

53
00:33:01,405 --> 00:33:05,780
if it is truth or untruth, it is love or hatred.

54
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,694
Only through vibrations you can do.

55
00:33:09,388 --> 00:33:12,130
But going beyond that, I am saying,

56
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:16,753
 beyond that one has to know
what are these vibrations

57
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,180
and what are they made of.

58
00:33:35,548 --> 00:33:41,185
What is the subtle force which is
behind those vibrations.

59
00:33:41,852 --> 00:33:45,674
We call it Paramchaitanya, alright.
Paramchaitanya, so what.

60
00:33:46,373 --> 00:33:50,648
What happens to you when you get Paramchaitanya,

61
00:33:50,674 --> 00:33:54,077
is something to be understood, the subtleties.

62
00:33:54,665 --> 00:34:00,164
As I said, we are made of five elements, alright?

63
00:34:00,515 --> 00:34:03,971
So when you get your awakening,
when the Kundalini reaches

64
00:34:03,996 --> 00:34:07,586
Sahasrara and opens out your fontanel bone area,

65
00:34:07,611 --> 00:34:15,876
 you become one with the Divine power,
then this Divine power itself starts flowing through you.

66
00:34:16,745 --> 00:34:19,314
A connection is established.

67
00:34:19,834 --> 00:34:25,689
Now when it starts flowing through you, this
Shakti starts flowing through you,

68
00:34:27,007 --> 00:34:29,455
 then what happens?

69
00:34:30,479 --> 00:34:33,851
The subtle part we should understand.

70
00:34:34,094 --> 00:34:40,857
The subtle part is like this, that these five
elements, we are made of,

71
00:34:40,952 --> 00:34:45,490
 these vibrations gradually start breaking into

72
00:34:45,521 --> 00:34:49,752
 the subtler form of which they are made.

73
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:55,767
So the first thing such a person has
 is the breaks, you see,

74
00:34:55,792 --> 00:35:00,211
as it is said that "Word is God."

75
00:35:01,084 --> 00:35:04,252
It's said also in the Bible, "The Word is God."

76
00:35:04,277 --> 00:35:06,325
Now what is this Word?

77
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:14,947
Word is a silent, we can say, silent commandment.

78
00:35:15,145 --> 00:35:17,114
We can call it like that.

79
00:35:17,276 --> 00:35:21,788
But from that Word comes,
according to Indian Philosophy,

80
00:35:21,836 --> 00:35:25,899
is another thing that we call as "Bindu"...

81
00:35:30,984 --> 00:35:35,560
 or we can say if Word becomes
Naad, is a sound...

82
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:44,912
and then it becomes the Bindu means
 one small dot, you can see

83
00:35:45,459 --> 00:35:48,048
 and then from this dot...

84
00:35:48,148 --> 00:35:53,534
you see, all these five elements
 start coming one after another.

85
00:35:53,828 --> 00:35:59,818
The first element that comes out is light...

86
00:36:01,318 --> 00:36:07,141
"Tej" light ... is the first element that comes out.

87
00:36:07,517 --> 00:36:12,530
So the essence of the first element is light.

88
00:36:15,197 --> 00:36:18,274
We call it Tej, Tejas.

89
00:36:18,379 --> 00:36:22,636
It is written, of course, in Sanskrit but we should understand

90
00:36:23,026 --> 00:36:28,427
that how the light pervades Sahaja Yoga so much

91
00:36:28,554 --> 00:36:31,652
and you see the light everywhere.

92
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:36,843
So the first element which is light

93
00:36:36,924 --> 00:36:45,994
 and you can say in English the light's subtle thing

94
00:36:46,019 --> 00:36:53,287
is, we can say, "enlightenment", you can say.

95
00:36:53,602 --> 00:37:00,006
But enlightenment has another meaning, so
we can say it is Tej, Tej.

96
00:37:00,308 --> 00:37:04,975
For example a person who gets realization has a face

97
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,311
which is very radiant, so you can say the "radiance".

98
00:37:09,336 --> 00:37:14,946
The radiance is the subtlety of the light.

99
00:37:15,016 --> 00:37:18,870
So this radiance starts showing on your face.

100
00:37:18,981 --> 00:37:22,511
Radiance starts expressing itself

101
00:37:22,543 --> 00:37:28,349
and with that radiance people get impressed

102
00:37:28,374 --> 00:37:34,828
and they start thinking something special about
 this personality which has a radiance.

103
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:38,973
Now you have seen my photographs also wherever they are,

104
00:37:38,998 --> 00:37:42,362
many a times you find lots of light around.

105
00:37:42,387 --> 00:37:50,711
That is nothing but the light in me is giving radiance

106
00:37:50,748 --> 00:37:53,438
because the light becomes subtler.

107
00:37:53,723 --> 00:37:57,134
When the light becomes subtle in me, -- light,

108
00:37:57,206 --> 00:38:02,231
light is one of the elements -- when it becomes subtler

109
00:38:02,256 --> 00:38:11,792
 then it gives radiance and so this is the
 subtle growth within you that takes place.

110
00:38:11,962 --> 00:38:14,757
Your faces also start shining.

111
00:38:14,782 --> 00:38:23,758
They too have radiance and they too have a
kind of a different complexion, I would say.

112
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:31,974
This radiance is to be understood, is the subtle of the light

113
00:38:32,304 --> 00:38:36,719
of which we are made, light in the gross manner.

114
00:38:37,488 --> 00:38:43,416
Then after this from the light comes the second thing,

115
00:38:43,441 --> 00:38:48,831
which we call as Vayu in Sanskrit, meaning the air.

116
00:38:49,069 --> 00:38:53,848
So the air that we have which is gross air,

117
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:58,801
what is subtle of air is the "cool breeze" that you get.

118
00:38:58,865 --> 00:39:03,358
The cool breeze is the subtle of that air.

119
00:39:03,442 --> 00:39:10,802
So the subtle of what you understand as cool breeze is

120
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:16,735
what we call vibrations, the subtle of that is air;

121
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,709
 which is a part and parcel of our making.

122
00:39:20,815 --> 00:39:28,858
So this cool breeze is the second thing that
you start getting subtler and subtler.

123
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:35,555
When your growth takes place, all these subtle
things start expressing themselves.

124
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:40,142
It is not only that you get vibrations
 but you get the cool breeze

125
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:45,230
and that is the subtler of air that has built you up.

126
00:39:48,231 --> 00:39:51,087
Then comes the Water.

127
00:39:51,642 --> 00:39:54,098
We are also made of water.

128
00:39:54,215 --> 00:39:59,245
What is the subtle of water is...

129
00:40:03,579 --> 00:40:07,678
sometimes English language,
you know, becomes little short of...

130
00:40:07,703 --> 00:40:12,836
 especially but they call it...

131
00:40:12,884 --> 00:40:19,403
I mean which makes the skin, hard skin soft.

132
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:23,366
The skin becomes soft.

133
00:40:24,985 --> 00:40:31,989
This is another sign of a realized soul that his...

134
00:40:33,823 --> 00:40:38,249
there is some cream they use, isn't it, to soften the face.

135
00:40:38,906 --> 00:40:48,966
But this is the water in us, gives us that
luster, that nourishment to make our skin

136
00:40:49,335 --> 00:40:54,076
very soft and that softness
of the skin becomes very visible.

137
00:40:54,192 --> 00:40:57,399
This is the minimum of minimum, I would say.

138
00:40:57,563 --> 00:41:06,101
But then a person who is a realized soul becomes
very soft person, very delicate.

139
00:41:06,126 --> 00:41:17,059
When he talks to some body, in his voice there
is warmth or I should say there is...

140
00:41:17,084 --> 00:41:28,549
[Mother speeks Hindi]... to have that flow,
watery flow and coolness of the water.

141
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:35,810
So that is the another subtle thing that should
be expressed in your behavior, on your skin,

142
00:41:36,105 --> 00:41:44,056
on your dealings with others, that you should
be like the water, which is mobile,

143
00:41:44,179 --> 00:41:50,304
which is cooling, which is soothing, which is cleansing.

144
00:41:50,381 --> 00:41:57,661
So this also becomes a part and parcel of
your being, once you become a realized soul.

145
00:41:58,512 --> 00:42:05,273
With this water you have also another thing
which we call it as Agni, means the fire.

146
00:42:05,665 --> 00:42:10,125
So you also have fire but it is a very silent fire.

147
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:15,140
It does not burn anybody but it burns all
the wrong things within you.

148
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:17,701
Whatever wrong things you have it burns

149
00:42:17,726 --> 00:42:20,776
and it burns the wrong things in other people also.

150
00:42:20,801 --> 00:42:25,211
For example, a person comes
with a great anger towards me.

151
00:42:25,558 --> 00:42:33,048
What happens that this anger becomes cooldown
with the fire that is there.

152
00:42:33,335 --> 00:42:38,310
Moreover, a realized soul cannot get burnt,

153
00:42:38,335 --> 00:42:44,252
fire cannot burn, the burning cannot come to him.

154
00:42:44,506 --> 00:42:46,897
It is very important to understand.

155
00:42:46,922 --> 00:42:51,148
Also if you are doing something wrong,

156
00:42:51,197 --> 00:42:55,875
it may burn you but if you are a good Sahaja Yogi

157
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:01,070
 and I should say, perfect Sahaja Yogi,
fire will never burn you.

158
00:43:01,532 --> 00:43:08,180
We have an example of Sita Ji that she went
into the fire Pariksha... nothing burnt.

159
00:43:08,437 --> 00:43:14,877
So this is what one has to understand, that
once you get to the subtleties of the fire,

160
00:43:15,027 --> 00:43:22,495
so the fire and the water both of them
become sort of Divine.

161
00:43:22,805 --> 00:43:26,791
For example, the water which you touch,

162
00:43:26,824 --> 00:43:32,720
 water you drink, whatever you put
your hand in the water,

163
00:43:32,745 --> 00:43:34,888
the water becomes vibrated.

164
00:43:34,913 --> 00:43:35,913
Means What?

165
00:43:36,228 --> 00:43:40,630
The subtleties of the water comes in it, the coolness,

166
00:43:40,655 --> 00:43:45,219
curing power also comes in that water.

167
00:43:45,434 --> 00:43:49,925
So when it becomes subtler,
all these powers start showing

168
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:54,230
which you can see for yourself.
You do not have to experiment.

169
00:43:56,524 --> 00:44:03,195
Then the lastly is the Mother Earth... is
most important... is Mother Earth.

170
00:44:03,756 --> 00:44:08,764
There is a photograph you might see which
was taken in Russia in My Dacha

171
00:44:08,789 --> 00:44:11,914
where the Kundalini is in the Mother Earth.

172
00:44:11,939 --> 00:44:13,855
They have shown clearly.

173
00:44:14,093 --> 00:44:18,733
It is there and it is the Mother Earth which shows.

174
00:44:18,995 --> 00:44:25,103
For example, I have seen flowers, if you keep
them in my room, they blossom.

175
00:44:25,128 --> 00:44:27,665
They can become very big like that,

176
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:32,169
 never people have seen such big flowers,
sometimes they say.

177
00:44:32,194 --> 00:44:33,367
I am doing nothing.

178
00:44:33,392 --> 00:44:35,970
I am just sitting down and
what happens to the flowers?

179
00:44:35,995 --> 00:44:41,528
You see now there this principle of
 the Mother Earth works...

180
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:45,320
 the subtle Mother Earth, is works, it's a mother.

181
00:44:45,471 --> 00:44:52,760
And that gives you all the nourishment and
makes you grow healthy,

182
00:44:52,977 --> 00:44:57,885
and this is how this subtlety works of the Mother Earth .

183
00:44:58,354 --> 00:45:04,082
Mother Earth is the one who is giver of virtue
to all these flowers

184
00:45:04,107 --> 00:45:09,321
and to all these trees and to all that,
but it also plays a big part in us.

185
00:45:09,346 --> 00:45:13,710
It is not only the Mother Earth that exists

186
00:45:13,735 --> 00:45:18,093
without our connection and we do not respect the Mother Earth.

187
00:45:18,118 --> 00:45:21,290
We have polluted it, we have done all kinds of things,

188
00:45:21,315 --> 00:45:26,715
we have removed the trees and we have made
a mess out of her, but she is our Mother

189
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:30,353
and so many subtle things of this Mother Earth

190
00:45:30,378 --> 00:45:34,315
 come into us. One of them is gravity.

191
00:45:34,628 --> 00:45:40,302
A person becomes very attractive, not in the physical sense

192
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:43,278
but in the spiritual sense.

193
00:45:43,303 --> 00:45:46,343
Such a person attracts others.

194
00:45:46,665 --> 00:45:54,504
They feel attrackted and they feel that something
special is about this person.

195
00:45:54,803 --> 00:45:57,952
This is one of the qualities of the Mother Earth.

196
00:45:57,977 --> 00:46:03,800
If she had not kept us attracted we would
have fallen off with her movement

197
00:46:03,825 --> 00:46:08,005
and also other qualities of the Mother Earth also

198
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:12,760
start manifesting within us, and we become very,

199
00:46:12,761 --> 00:46:20,263
I should say, extremely tolerant, patient... person.

200
00:46:20,288 --> 00:46:24,645
Tolerant and patient... extremely tolerant and patient.

201
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:29,207
But if you are not tolerant, if you are hot
tempered and all that,

202
00:46:29,232 --> 00:46:32,884
then Mother Earth's principle is not expressed I should say.

203
00:46:32,909 --> 00:46:36,172
Look at the Mother Earth.
How much she tolerates our nonsense,

204
00:46:36,197 --> 00:46:41,529
how many wrong things we do against her,
 but still she tolerates.

205
00:46:41,554 --> 00:46:45,248
Sri Ganesha's quality is to tolerate, to begin with.

206
00:46:45,273 --> 00:46:48,862
Up to a point, he tolerates.
 In the same way,

207
00:46:48,887 --> 00:46:54,638
 we too become extremely tolerant,
patient and forgiving.

208
00:46:55,043 --> 00:47:00,604
This is the minimum of minimum that should
happen to all the Sahajayogis who have vibrations,

209
00:47:00,629 --> 00:47:05,839
because now I have told you all the things
that are expressed in your vibrations.

210
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:12,800
It is a thing to be understood that what you
have become now is something very great,

211
00:47:13,184 --> 00:47:20,291
 it has not happened to others, it has not happened
to somebody who is not being a Sahaja Yogi.

212
00:47:20,316 --> 00:47:26,525
You see the people who go to Church or to
Mosques or to Temple, see their faces.

213
00:47:27,276 --> 00:47:29,555
Look at them, how do they look like?

214
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:33,218
They haven't got anything from the Temple,
they haven't got anything

215
00:47:33,243 --> 00:47:40,794
from the Mosque, they haven't got anything from
any one of these places where they go to worship.

216
00:47:40,935 --> 00:47:42,968
So, that is artificial.

217
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:50,280
That has become something, I should say, without
any connection with the reality.

218
00:47:50,305 --> 00:47:56,780
Only after realization you are connected with
reality and you can get

219
00:47:56,805 --> 00:48:03,702
 the understanding of all these
subtleties working through you.

220
00:48:03,727 --> 00:48:09,050
Why I am telling you this, because I want
you to know and recognize yourself,

221
00:48:09,075 --> 00:48:12,331
to understand what you are, what you have got.

222
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:17,950
Once you recognize yourself and understand
yourself you can do a lot.

223
00:48:17,975 --> 00:48:25,599
First of all to say that I am a Sahaja Yogi
itself it should be very much with self confidence

224
00:48:25,624 --> 00:48:30,421
and as a self confident person should find
out what have I done as Sahaja Yogi?

225
00:48:30,446 --> 00:48:32,154
What can I do as Sahaja Yogi?

226
00:48:32,179 --> 00:48:34,699
Some Sahaja Yogis have done wonders.

227
00:48:34,724 --> 00:48:41,057
They have done such a lot of work of Sahaja Yoga,
while some Sahaja Yogis are still writing to me

228
00:48:41,082 --> 00:48:47,755
that "my husband is fighting with me,
my son is like this, my mother like this";

229
00:48:47,755 --> 00:48:52,182
all the time, you see, letters after letters
come to me.

230
00:48:52,207 --> 00:48:54,842
You are a Sahaja Yogi.

231
00:48:55,024 --> 00:48:59,672
Now you just see to your subtleties, work it out.

232
00:48:59,706 --> 00:49:04,114
They think I am here to solve their problems,
their family problems,

233
00:49:04,139 --> 00:49:08,161
and their jobs and things.
I am not here for that.

234
00:49:08,186 --> 00:49:11,186
I am here to give you self-realization

235
00:49:11,211 --> 00:49:17,299
and the understanding that whatever you have got,
 you must accept as a challenge,

236
00:49:17,339 --> 00:49:21,828
 take it up as a challenge and you will be amazed,
how you will be helped

237
00:49:21,853 --> 00:49:24,189
 and how you will get the results!

238
00:49:24,214 --> 00:49:29,322
"Sahaja" does not mean only
that you get spontaneous realization.

239
00:49:29,347 --> 00:49:31,991
It also means that you get spontaneity.

240
00:49:32,016 --> 00:49:34,335
The whole nature gets spontaneity.

241
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:38,086
All these subtle things that I have told you,
they also get spontaneous

242
00:49:38,111 --> 00:49:39,964
and they work it out.

243
00:49:39,989 --> 00:49:44,637
Of course, there are Angels and there are
Ganas who are helping you

244
00:49:44,662 --> 00:49:47,329
 but you need not worry about them just now.

245
00:49:47,354 --> 00:49:51,545
Main thing is you must realize what you are,
what have you got

246
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:56,664
and how much you have faced it,
you have got it and how it has worked?

247
00:49:56,751 --> 00:50:04,135
I have seen every time I just have a little
problem of something, immediately it works.

248
00:50:05,448 --> 00:50:12,600
It works in such quarters and such people
that I never expected.

249
00:50:12,625 --> 00:50:14,489
Just  comes in.

250
00:50:14,514 --> 00:50:16,373
Everything works out.

251
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:22,391
But whatever works out is for your good,
 is for your growth,

252
00:50:22,416 --> 00:50:25,916
for your understanding that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

253
00:50:25,941 --> 00:50:31,140
You have entered into the Kingdom of God,
but this you have to develop.

254
00:50:31,149 --> 00:50:38,079
Also, introspection can tell you that are
you working out all those things or not?

255
00:50:38,104 --> 00:50:44,691
If you take to introspection, you will be
surprised to see, yes, you have these powers

256
00:50:44,807 --> 00:50:47,092
and you can do wonders.

257
00:50:47,156 --> 00:50:52,576
So I bless you all, please develop those subtle
things within you.

258
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,347
They are already there; you do not
have to do anything.

259
00:50:55,372 --> 00:50:57,542
Only understand and locate.

260
00:50:57,567 --> 00:51:00,947
Thank you very much.
