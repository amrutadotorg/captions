00:04.089 --> 00:14.801
In Sahaja Yoga the Guru puja has a very
different significance

00:15.002 --> 00:19.777
from any other guru puja.

00:23.780 --> 00:28.348
When you worship your Guru

00:28.549 --> 00:36.558
you are also worshipping the Guru within
you.

00:40.727 --> 00:51.075
This is not in any other guru-disciple
system

00:51.276 --> 01:02.577
because, in you, the Guru, the Master has
been awakened.

01:02.778 --> 01:08.266
And so, when you are worshipping your Guru,

01:08.466 --> 01:14.812
then this Master within you is also
worshipped, you respect it,

01:15.013 --> 01:21.687
you glorify it, you awaken it, and you
manifest it.

01:22.346 --> 01:31.817
This we have to realise that – in Sahaja
Yoga – if you are a Sahaja Yogi.

01:32.532 --> 01:43.338
Now, the quality of Guru, first and
foremost, is that he makes you meet God:

01:43.973 --> 01:47.991
means he raises the Kundalini

01:48.192 --> 01:56.947
and establish the relation between
the All-pervading Power.

01:57.645 --> 02:00.181
And as your Guru is Adi Shakti,

02:00.382 --> 02:05.033
you make that person meet, also,
the Adi Shakti.

02:05.234 --> 02:10.596
So you have a double advantage that,
at the same time,

02:10.797 --> 02:13.948
when you give them Realisation,

02:14.149 --> 02:21.091
not only that you make them feel the union
with the Divine Power,

02:21.292 --> 02:25.394
but you can make them meet the Divinity
Itself,

02:25.594 --> 02:29.064
the source of Divine Power.

02:29.265 --> 02:34.503
So your responsibility, as Sahaja Yogis,
is very great

02:34.704 --> 02:38.527
because in you is there is the Guru.

02:38.728 --> 02:46.577
Now in our mantras we say that, “Mother,
I am my own Guru.”

02:46.778 --> 02:54.202
But, saying that, do we realise that:
if I am my own Guru,

02:54.403 --> 03:02.125
this “I” and “my Guru,” between the two,
what have I achieved?

03:02.326 --> 03:07.387
Where am I? Can I guide myself?

03:07.633 --> 03:11.885
Have I got the light of the Spirit on my
attention so well established

03:12.086 --> 03:19.970
and manifested that I can guide myself and
guide others later on?

03:20.171 --> 03:25.366
First of all, in the Guru principle it is
important

03:25.567 --> 03:30.471
that you see to yourself –
the introspection:

03:30.672 --> 03:37.720
Can I be my own Guru? Have I become
my own Guru?

03:39.889 --> 03:47.365
Now, in your case, your Guru is a Mother,
a woman,

03:47.566 --> 03:59.295
so, it has to be among women that
the development of their Guru qualities

03:59.496 --> 04:06.812
have to be very well manifested. But it’s
just the way it is not.

04:07.013 --> 04:10.418
For them, they are still the mothers or
they are the wives

04:10.619 --> 04:20.256
or they are Sahaja Yoginis. But they don’t
realise that you are also the Gurus.

04:20.457 --> 04:24.223
And, because your Mother is a Guru,
because She is a woman;

04:24.424 --> 04:29.472
and you have to be also of that quality,
that people should say,

04:29.673 --> 04:32.333
“Look at this woman, she’s such a Guru.”

04:32.534 --> 04:36.431
But still, as I hear from the different
leaders

04:36.631 --> 04:40.897
that the ladies are absolutely still very
much far away

04:41.098 --> 04:46.895
and are very few who can be called as real
Sahaja Yoginis.

04:47.096 --> 04:50.518
It’s a sad thing to hear.

04:50.719 --> 04:58.713
Because if you still keep to all these
mundane things of womanhood

04:58.914 --> 05:04.084
and the drawbacks of womanhood, which has
come out of domination maybe,

05:04.285 --> 05:08.938
because of always they were shown to be
something lower.

05:09.139 --> 05:16.127
Specially in the Christian religion they
were never regarded as something holy.

05:16.328 --> 05:19.974
They have this kind of a diffidence in them

05:20.175 --> 05:23.445
that they don’t understand that dharma

05:23.646 --> 05:27.752
can be established more by women than
by men.

05:27.953 --> 05:31.980
And the Guru’s work is to establish
the dharma –

05:32.181 --> 05:38.115
in the society, in the family, in
relationships.

05:38.316 --> 05:43.835
All these Gurus, which are representing
all these great symbols here,

05:44.036 --> 05:47.478
have done nothing but have established
dharma.

05:47.679 --> 05:51.190
But, first of all, before establishing
the dharma,

05:51.391 --> 05:57.325
we should watch ourselves – have we got
dharma within ourselves or not?

05:59.182 --> 06:05.031
First of all, the quality of a person who
has dharma

06:05.232 --> 06:13.294
is that he listens to others, he obeys.

06:15.199 --> 06:18.511
And this is something [that] has gone wrong
with the Western women, I think,

06:18.712 --> 06:24.184
that they have forgotten how to listen to
others, how to obey others.

06:24.385 --> 06:28.421
That’s why their children also don’t obey
them.

06:30.794 --> 06:35.767
Obedience, if you do not have, nobody’s
going to obey you.

06:35.968 --> 06:39.287
First, you must learn to obey.

06:39.488 --> 06:48.285
A person like Kabira, because he was born
of a unknown cast,

06:48.509 --> 06:52.786
people didn’t know what he was born from,

06:52.987 --> 06:59.974
and he could not go directly to any Guru.

07:00.175 --> 07:07.274
So, he heard about Ramanand, a great Guru
of those days,

07:07.475 --> 07:12.275
who used to go to the river Ganges every
morning to have his bath.

07:12.476 --> 07:18.140
So one day on his steps Kabira kept lying,

07:18.349 --> 07:24.454
and in the darkness the Guru could not see,
and he touched him with his feet.

07:24.655 --> 07:28.884
He said, “Who are you?” So he said,
“I’m Kabir,

07:29.085 --> 07:34.521
and I’m your disciple.” And he caught hold
of his feet.

07:34.722 --> 07:38.256
And when he caught hold of his feet, he
[Ramanand] said, “Alright, come along!”.

07:38.457 --> 07:45.439
And then he became such a great saint
in India.

07:45.653 --> 07:49.655
People know him more than they know his
Guru; he became so great.

07:49.856 --> 07:52.206
The basic thing is humility.

07:52.407 --> 07:55.876
Yesterday you saw how the musician
(Nishat Khan) was humble.

07:56.077 --> 07:59.244
All the time he was humble.

07:59.445 --> 08:02.773
He didn’t know how to express his humility
every time.

08:02.974 --> 08:05.871
All the time he was humble.

08:06.072 --> 08:11.575
Because in humility only you can receive
the blessings,

08:11.776 --> 08:18.479
you can receive the quality that is of your
Guru.

08:20.413 --> 08:22.789
Now, for a Guru as you have seen

08:22.990 --> 08:29.512
that, in My own way, in My own image,
you have to come up.

08:29.713 --> 08:33.397
First of all your life should be absolutely
transparent.

08:33.598 --> 08:36.693
Transparency is the essence of Sahaja Yoga.

08:36.894 --> 08:39.908
Everybody should know what you are doing,
where you are going,

08:40.109 --> 08:47.117
what is the way you live, what is the way
you are behaving.

08:47.318 --> 08:53.138
I have seen people, who are gurus, also
in the sense that we call them leaders,

08:53.339 --> 08:56.253
or we can call them sub-gurus, or they
cannot be called as priest,

08:56.453 --> 09:00.101
but I can say ‘communication centres’
as they are.

09:00.302 --> 09:07.925
In them you find that they are very fussy
type of people.

09:08.126 --> 09:11.907
Always think about their body, always think
about their comfort,

09:12.108 --> 09:15.680
always grudge about – nobody looked after
them –

09:15.881 --> 09:20.250
as if they suffer from persecution-mania!

09:20.717 --> 09:24.404
Or they will grudge about food, “I didn’t
eat my food for one day!”

09:24.605 --> 09:26.302
Doesn’t matter!

09:26.503 --> 09:31.167
For a Guru it’s better to starve for about
three, four days nicely,

09:31.368 --> 09:36.136
so that you get over this idea of hunger.

09:36.337 --> 09:40.097
You’ll be surprised since I’m here I have
not eaten anything much,

09:40.298 --> 09:45.051
and just drinking something, because just
the Guru has no hunger.

09:45.252 --> 09:49.906
Because it is in your stomach the Guru,
vibrations, are so much

09:50.107 --> 09:52.922
that you don’t feel like eating anything.

09:53.123 --> 09:56.572
So then, what do you eat and how do you
eat and all these things

09:56.773 --> 09:59.183
that we have given up to come to Sahaja
Yoga.

09:59.384 --> 10:02.470
So even if leaders have this nonsense
in their head

10:02.670 --> 10:08.250
[like] what do you get to eat! I mean, this
is the basics, absolutely!

10:08.451 --> 10:11.730
And when I hear some people telling Me, oh,
what did they eat

10:11.930 --> 10:19.087
and how did they eat and all! It’s like I
feel they are like tourists in Sahaja Yoga.

10:19.288 --> 10:22.107
Just come in Sahaja Yoga like tourists,

10:22.308 --> 10:24.563
you see, to see places and go round

10:24.764 --> 10:31.181
and to know where you get, in what
restaurant, you get good food and cheaply.

10:32.768 --> 10:36.342
All this is so basically,

10:36.543 --> 10:42.819
absolutely not a manifestation of Guru
principle.

10:43.020 --> 10:47.371
Now you have seen your Guru as She is.

10:47.572 --> 10:53.576
I do not know what I eat, what they give
Me, what I want.

10:53.777 --> 10:57.079
They go on giving Me whatever they think
I like,

10:57.280 --> 11:01.450
and I just don’t know if I like that thing
or not, or what is it.

11:01.651 --> 11:03.997
If they ask Me, “Mother, what will You
have?” I said, “What will I have,

11:04.198 --> 11:07.313
I don’t know really, what will I have?
Anything!”

11:07.514 --> 11:09.657
So there has to be no choices.

11:09.858 --> 11:13.796
First of all not to waste your attention
on choices.

11:13.997 --> 11:16.833
Of course, only on vibrations.

11:17.034 --> 11:19.439
I mean, supposing, you go to a restaurant,

11:19.640 --> 11:23.123
find all kinds of funny vibrations there,

11:23.324 --> 11:26.429
people are getting drunk or anything, then
of course you should say.

11:26.630 --> 11:31.635
But all the choices must be based on
vibrations and not on material things.

11:31.836 --> 11:33.869
That you get something nice there,
“Let’s go there,”

11:34.070 --> 11:40.100
and they’ll travel for fifty miles to go
eat something nonsensical.

11:40.301 --> 11:43.733
It should be all nonsense for all Sahaja
Yogis.

11:43.934 --> 11:47.531
And when I said “Sahaja Yogi” it means
also Sahaja Yoginis.

11:47.732 --> 11:51.502
So the food part of it is aswadha.

11:51.703 --> 11:55.379
You should not have any taste for any
special food.

11:55.580 --> 11:58.273
Specially in France to say that people
may not like,

11:58.474 --> 12:07.123
but French are very, very conscientious or
aware about the food part.

12:07.324 --> 12:10.356
I don’t know how far they make really
good food,

12:10.557 --> 12:14.440
but at least they think they eat very good
food. Alright.

12:14.641 --> 12:21.829
So, the eating of good food is a kind
of an addiction.

12:22.030 --> 12:24.856
It’s a kind of an addiction; it’s something
like drug –

12:25.057 --> 12:27.294
that you must have good food.

12:27.495 --> 12:33.436
So Zen started this system of what they
call the tea ceremony.

12:33.637 --> 12:38.929
In the tea ceremony what they did, I mean,
I have been through that

12:39.130 --> 12:43.492
and it’s really quite a test of people.

12:43.693 --> 12:48.220
With Me it was alright, but the rest
of them got really frightened.

12:48.421 --> 12:51.266
That in the tea ceremony whatever rituals
they do

12:51.467 --> 12:55.466
they give you a tea, which is so bitter,

12:55.667 --> 12:58.144
and we can say [like] quinine raised
to power 108!

12:58.345 --> 13:00.894
It’s like that. And they give you very
nicely,

13:01.095 --> 13:06.241
handle you with such ritual that you have
to take it.

13:06.442 --> 13:11.493
So first they say, “You see the cup without
thinking.”

13:11.694 --> 13:15.203
So he tried to make thoughtless awareness
through the cup.

13:15.404 --> 13:18.246
I don’t know how much one can achieve
with that.

13:18.447 --> 13:27.234
But that tea if you take once, your tongue
is good for anything.

13:29.409 --> 13:34.186
And to compensate it they give you
something sweet,

13:34.387 --> 13:37.078
which is again sweetness raised to power
108,

13:37.279 --> 13:42.016
so sweet that it becomes bitter! So sweet.

13:42.219 --> 13:46.318
So this is just to conquer the tongue
[that] Zen must have thought

13:46.519 --> 13:52.002
that better give them this tea ceremony

13:52.203 --> 13:55.066
where there is no tea, there’s nothing

13:55.267 --> 14:00.198
but just you really give such shocks
to your tongue,

14:00.399 --> 14:04.392
so that after that you can eat whatever
you get.

14:04.593 --> 14:10.923
And that’s why you must know that Japanese
can eat anything.

14:11.124 --> 14:15.284
They have solved their food problem
because they can eat anything!

14:15.485 --> 14:24.449
They can just fish out some crabs or could
be some prawns,

14:24.650 --> 14:28.425
just peel them out like peanuts and eat
them like that.

14:28.626 --> 14:30.618
I think Zen has solved this problem
for them,

14:30.818 --> 14:34.870
because they have food shortage and this is
how they can eat everything:

14:35.071 --> 14:37.733
they can eat the bark of the tree, they can
eat the snake,

14:37.934 --> 14:41.764
they can eat the lizards, they can eat
the frogs, everything they can eat.

14:41.965 --> 14:47.695
So all their eating problems are solved
in that country by Zen, I think,

14:47.896 --> 14:53.166
because you have no taste.

14:53.825 --> 14:58.799
But in this I think the worst are,
in the whole world are Indians.

14:59.016 --> 15:04.121
They are the fussiest people for food.
Because their women have spoiled them.

15:04.322 --> 15:06.155
They know very good cooking and they know

15:06.356 --> 15:09.007
how to handle their husbands by cooking
very well.

15:09.208 --> 15:11.529
And the way they cook food for them,
you see,

15:11.729 --> 15:14.021
the men have to go back to Indian food.

15:14.222 --> 15:17.479
Even if they travel the whole world,
they’ll need Indian food,

15:17.680 --> 15:19.653
they can’t get over their tongues.

15:19.854 --> 15:23.392
It is such a big conditioning in India
of food

15:23.593 --> 15:25.836
that I just don’t know how will they get
out,

15:26.037 --> 15:30.372
the, absolutely, the basics which are
important.

15:30.573 --> 15:33.527
Gandhiji tried that very much in
the ashram.

15:33.728 --> 15:41.100
He used to give horrid food, boiled food
with the oil of mustard on top

15:41.301 --> 15:44.285
and then nobody could eat that. Raw!

15:44.486 --> 15:46.906
And he used to make everybody eat that.

15:47.107 --> 15:52.904
Not only that, he would make them clean
the bathrooms, WC’s, everything

15:53.105 --> 15:56.671
so that you get rid of your nose also, that
you need everything.

15:56.872 --> 15:59.471
Because so many people you will, while
eating also in India

15:59.672 --> 16:02.709
will put something to their noses, and they
smell everything.

16:02.910 --> 16:06.538
So they are oversensitive to their tongue
and to their nose.

16:06.739 --> 16:09.319
But not to their eyes, to eyes they are
not.

16:09.520 --> 16:15.407
For eyes I would say the most sensitive
people are Japanese and Chinese

16:15.608 --> 16:18.255
and also the Western people are very much
sensitive

16:18.455 --> 16:21.967
because they don’t like to see anything
dirty, filthy or ugly.

16:22.168 --> 16:24.432
Indians won’t mind any dirt, filth,
anything,

16:24.633 --> 16:31.941
just like dogs and what you call, horses
or buffalos!

16:32.142 --> 16:35.387
They can walk through any dirt, filth –
anything!

16:35.588 --> 16:39.118
Nothing matters to them, anything ugly,
any ugly building

16:39.319 --> 16:42.754
or an ugly dress or anything is alright
for them.

16:42.955 --> 16:45.965
It doesn’t matter, to their eyes it doesn’t
matter at all.

16:46.166 --> 16:50.144
Only thing [is that] kitchen should be clean
and they are all the time in the kitchen.

16:50.345 --> 16:52.932
So we don’t have to learn all these bad
things from Indians.

16:53.133 --> 16:56.057
There are some good things they have, but
there are certain things

16:56.258 --> 16:57.777
[which] are very bad conditionings.

16:57.978 --> 17:01.029
And the next to that are, I think,
the French.

17:01.230 --> 17:04.094
But if you eat English food you can become
quite good

17:04.294 --> 17:08.443
because there’s no taste in English food.

17:19.678 --> 17:25.171
So, I have no problem anywhere because
I think I have no taste at all

17:25.372 --> 17:28.143
and I can eat anything any way it is
cooked, it’s alright,

17:28.344 --> 17:32.419
I don’t bother about what is cooked, what
is not cooked.

17:32.620 --> 17:36.927
But if you have some French people for
a dinner in a restaurant

17:37.128 --> 17:39.870
they will spend forty-five minutes deciding
what they are going to eat,

17:40.070 --> 17:41.845
and what a waste of energy!

17:42.046 --> 17:44.805
Forty-five minutes just to decide what they
are going to eat!

17:45.006 --> 17:48.134
After all what is so great, what you are
going to eat? It’s all there.

17:48.335 --> 17:50.652
Just one thing that everybody should have.

17:50.853 --> 17:55.055
So for Sahaja Yogis it’s important to give
up this idea, “I will have this.”

17:55.256 --> 18:00.933
First of all nobody should ask, “What will
you have?”

18:01.134 --> 18:06.612
To Me also. I do not like people asking Me
questions [like], “What will You have?”

18:06.813 --> 18:11.734
Because I’ve to think about it and I want
to be in Nirvichara.

18:28.124 --> 18:35.458
So, this is a, one, big ordeal, which we do
not understand:

18:35.659 --> 18:40.737
how much we are attached to food. And food
goes in the stomach.

18:40.938 --> 18:43.612
And not only that it spoils our guru
system,

18:43.812 --> 18:46.577
but also spoils our physical system.

18:46.778 --> 18:50.208
So we should try not to look at food.

18:50.409 --> 18:53.903
That’s why fasting was told to the all
the people

18:54.104 --> 19:00.042
who wanted to develop their Gurupada,
so that they should not fast.

19:00.243 --> 19:07.693
But they do not fast normally because
they think of food, so there’s no fasting.

19:07.894 --> 19:12.210
I mean, fasting means that you go into
Nirvichara and don’t think of food.

19:12.411 --> 19:16.120
But they are all the time thinking of food,
so it has no meaning

19:16.321 --> 19:20.710
and you are just the same whether you eat it
or not, your mind is eating it all the time.

19:20.911 --> 19:23.418
Then you start thinking, “When will I end
my fast

19:23.619 --> 19:27.852
and know where will I go to have what?”

19:29.609 --> 19:32.527
So this is a very basic thing that we
should get rid

19:32.728 --> 19:35.533
of our habits, of our conditionings –

19:35.734 --> 19:38.878
what we are going to have and what food
we are going to have.

19:39.079 --> 19:45.595
Our children also should be given a proper
training about it that –

19:45.796 --> 19:49.865
it’s alright, sometimes there is no salt,
sometimes there’s no sugar, doesn’t matter.

19:50.066 --> 19:52.139
And sometimes there’s nothing, doesn’t
matter.

19:52.340 --> 19:53.870
Nothing [is] important for a Sahaja Yogi,

19:54.070 --> 19:59.544
you can live without food for days
together, no problem.

20:01.718 --> 20:08.321
So for a Sahaja Yogi there’s nothing like
taste of food and hunger.

20:08.522 --> 20:15.083
There’s only one hunger is to be purified,
to be clean.

20:15.284 --> 20:19.954
This is one of the things that dirties
our mind, we should say,

20:20.155 --> 20:24.650
that we think about food all the time.

20:26.921 --> 20:30.639
Even in Russia I found people carried
all Indian things there,

20:30.840 --> 20:34.826
they were cooking all Indian things, and
I am, poor thing, I can’t eat anything.

20:35.027 --> 20:37.548
So they cooked, brought everything for Me,
thinking I’m an Indian,

20:37.749 --> 20:43.240
but they don’t know I am Zen – I cannot,
I do not, have sense of taste.

20:43.441 --> 20:47.531
So once, to get over taste one has to work
out.

20:47.732 --> 20:50.487
It’s an experiment we have to do with
ourselves.

20:50.688 --> 20:56.705
Unless and until we introspect ourselves
and do experiments we cannot rise.

20:56.906 --> 20:59.424
Because though the Kundalini is trying
her level best,

20:59.624 --> 21:01.481
but your conditionings are so great

21:01.682 --> 21:07.694
that it cannot pierce through and cannot
make you onto that Guru level.

21:07.895 --> 21:11.652
If you see the lives of all these Gurus:
they were married,

21:11.853 --> 21:14.923
they had children, they lived a normal life

21:15.124 --> 21:21.566
but in their own personal life they were
absolutely detached people.

21:21.767 --> 21:27.143
So, first detachment should come from food.

21:27.344 --> 21:31.853
And there whatever you like you just
don’t eat.

21:32.054 --> 21:34.426
That’s the best way. Because already
because of liking something…

21:34.626 --> 21:36.885
supposing if somebody’s fond of ice-cream.

21:37.086 --> 21:41.459
He must have already spoiled his liver;
so then, give [it] up now.

21:41.660 --> 21:44.964
If you like pasta, give up pasta.

21:45.165 --> 21:47.118
If you like something else, just give up,

21:47.319 --> 21:50.216
don’t ask for it and don’t eat it at all;

21:50.417 --> 21:55.309
so that, you see, your mind will get little
bit detached from it.

21:55.510 --> 22:00.727
It’s very easy to achieve this detachment,
I think,

22:00.928 --> 22:07.225
if you work it out in a sensible way. Just
try to punish your body.

22:07.426 --> 22:09.834
You see, if you are your Guru, you better
take hold

22:10.035 --> 22:12.565
of first of all your body and your
conditionings.

22:12.766 --> 22:15.624
You have to treat your body with this
thing.

22:15.825 --> 22:18.484
I am told many girls who have married
abroad

22:18.685 --> 22:20.709
are still making their Indian food and
eating that.

22:20.910 --> 22:23.431
It’s horrible it is! They should starve.

22:23.632 --> 22:27.385
If they starve for say about five, six days
or maybe eight days,

22:27.586 --> 22:31.012
then they’ll eat any food in any case.

22:31.213 --> 22:32.865
That’s why the fasting is given.

22:33.066 --> 22:38.060
So one should adjust oneself to any kind
of food you can have.

22:38.261 --> 22:41.517
And if you want to survive then you eat
anything,

22:41.718 --> 22:44.083
so just make it a point that you get rid

22:44.284 --> 22:48.166
of this very simple conditioning you have –

22:48.367 --> 22:53.503
of liking the food that you want to eat and
you don’t want to have anything else.

22:53.704 --> 22:58.533
I think as Sahaja Yogini or Sahaja Yogi who
cannot get rid of this little thing,

22:58.734 --> 23:02.396
then how can you call him a Sahaja Yogi?
I don’t know. He’s very asahaj.

23:02.597 --> 23:05.406
Because the other day I met one lady.

23:05.607 --> 23:07.234
I said, “What is the matter, where have
you been?”

23:07.435 --> 23:11.197
She said, “I have been looking out for some
sort of an Indian ingredient.”

23:11.398 --> 23:15.251
I said, “How can you get it here in this
Spain? You cannot.” “Why?”

23:15.452 --> 23:18.102
“Because they asked me to make Indian
food.” “Alright.

23:18.303 --> 23:19.937
Then without that can’t you make Indian
food?

23:20.138 --> 23:22.298
What is the need to run all the way, whole
day

23:22.499 --> 23:24.489
for a one small little thing called hing
(asafoetida)?”.

23:24.690 --> 23:27.279
There’s a big name for that, it’s a small
little thing.

23:27.480 --> 23:31.490
Just to get that she had to run all over
the places to get it!

23:31.691 --> 23:36.209
So for people who are Sahaja Yogis if they
are sahaj,

23:36.410 --> 23:43.565
whatever is available you can make
something nice out of it and eat it.

23:43.766 --> 23:47.300
So that shows what? It shows sagacity,

23:47.501 --> 23:51.996
shows trupti (contentment), shows your
satisfaction.

23:52.197 --> 23:55.324
And that is one of the manifestations
of a Guru

23:55.525 --> 23:58.374
that he’s a satisfied soul.

23:58.575 --> 24:02.332
He’s just self-contained, he doesn’t
bother.

24:02.533 --> 24:06.443
Now, for example, some people, specially
in the West,

24:06.643 --> 24:09.100
thank God, they are not spoiled by their
wives so much.

24:09.301 --> 24:12.041
They don’t have so much of conditioning,
they can eat anything.

24:12.242 --> 24:15.291
I’ve seen that when they come on the India
tour,

24:15.492 --> 24:18.165
all the Indians say, “Horrid food was given

24:18.366 --> 24:22.489
and the poor things were eating that horrid
food and this and that.”

24:22.690 --> 24:25.722
And I asked them, “Which place you like
the best?”

24:25.923 --> 24:28.147
They said, “Brahmapuri.” I said, “Eh? They
were saying

24:28.348 --> 24:31.084
Brahmapuri had the worst food and everybody
is complaining.”

24:31.285 --> 24:32.945
“No, no. Brahmapuri was the best,

24:33.146 --> 24:36.129
because we could bathe in the river and we
could sing

24:36.330 --> 24:39.956
and we could enjoy it!” You see, that’s
the sign of one thing,

24:40.157 --> 24:46.085
to get rid of your bad habits of food
business.

24:46.379 --> 24:52.177
Now the second part is for the body you
need comforts.

24:52.378 --> 24:55.673
I must congratulate the Western Sahaja
Yogis

24:55.873 --> 25:00.394
that they may be coming from any walk
of life –

25:00.595 --> 25:03.617
I must say, the Indians have to learn
from them –

25:03.817 --> 25:07.480
they may be coming from any position
or status.

25:07.681 --> 25:14.701
All of them enjoy the comfort of the Spirit
when they travel in the Tour.

25:14.902 --> 25:18.222
They do not ask for, “I haven’t got
a chair,

25:18.422 --> 25:22.567
I haven’t got a bed, I haven’t got a proper
things here.”

25:22.768 --> 25:25.697
In this way, you see, you will realise

25:25.898 --> 25:31.061
that the body comfort is of no importance.

25:31.262 --> 25:34.405
It’s, we have just spoilt our body, there’s
no need, no need.

25:34.606 --> 25:37.210
Body you put it anywhere, will sleep
in any case.

25:37.411 --> 25:40.014
If you cannot sleep for two nights,

25:40.215 --> 25:42.590
alright, put on some music for one night
or two nights

25:42.791 --> 25:46.889
as we had here, you will sleep anyway!

25:57.499 --> 26:07.454
So this is the second point is that we have
to give up body comfort.

26:07.655 --> 26:12.055
But the third point where I think
the Western people falter

26:12.256 --> 26:17.123
is their materialistic attitude.
Materialistic attitude

26:17.324 --> 26:24.678
and their fondness of their eyes. So one
of them is the worst of all.

26:24.879 --> 26:28.109
I mean, the worst in worst of all is that
you can never have,

26:28.310 --> 26:31.147
that’s such a big blot if you have that,

26:31.348 --> 26:35.053
is to have a roving eye and things like
that.

26:35.254 --> 26:39.053
It’s out of question. That’s out of
question for women or for men.

26:39.254 --> 26:42.072
They are not Sahaja Yogis by any chance.

26:42.273 --> 26:47.252
They have to have very clean eyes.

26:47.453 --> 26:49.539
That part is alright.

26:49.740 --> 26:53.829
And the second part is the greed, lust
and greed.

26:54.030 --> 26:58.470
Of course, with Sahaja Yoga maybe the lust
part is over,

26:58.671 --> 27:05.310
but greed is still there with so many who
get lost.

27:05.511 --> 27:09.132
So I would say Indians do not have this
lust problem,

27:09.333 --> 27:14.439
but they still have greed, greed problem –
means they want to buy something

27:14.640 --> 27:20.274
like a radio or some electrical stuff they
must buy.

27:20.475 --> 27:22.514
If they come abroad they must buy
something.

27:22.715 --> 27:26.001
It’s alright, if you get it, well and good,
if they don’t get it, well and good.

27:26.202 --> 27:29.079
It should be [that attitude]. But for
a Westerner, you see,

27:29.280 --> 27:34.708
he would not like to give up his furniture,
which his great grandmother had it.

27:34.909 --> 27:37.276
Though he can’t sit on it because it’s so
old.

27:37.477 --> 27:40.879
If he sits on it, it will break. But he
must keep it to show off that,

27:41.080 --> 27:44.610
“I had a great grandmother who gave this
unique chair.”

27:44.811 --> 27:49.463
According to Indian standards it’s junk!
Absolute junk.

27:49.664 --> 27:52.351
Because it is good for nothing you put it
in the drawing room,

27:52.552 --> 27:55.510
nobody can sit on it and it looks junky.

27:55.711 --> 27:58.830
But according to the Western mind the older
it is, the better –

27:59.031 --> 28:02.409
whether it is a junk or anything – he’ll
have so many junks in the house

28:02.610 --> 28:04.733
and then they will sell like hot cakes.

28:04.934 --> 28:08.021
Because there’s a very subtle materialistic
attitude

28:08.221 --> 28:11.543
towards matter that, “This will sell like
hot cakes if I sell it”,

28:11.744 --> 28:16.729
because there must be another mad Westerner
who would like to buy that junk. You see?

28:16.930 --> 28:20.934
So this junk that you have in the house
it’s better to get rid of,

28:21.135 --> 28:24.318
because God knows how many people must
have used [it].

28:24.519 --> 28:27.402
It’s like a grave in the house. It’s
a grave.

28:27.603 --> 28:30.950
So to have then also the antique jewellery.

28:31.151 --> 28:38.123
Antique jewellery is another mad, antique
is a – what you can say –

28:38.324 --> 28:42.926
is the fad or addiction of the Western
people – antique.

28:43.127 --> 28:47.367
For us nothing is antique because we still
produce antique things, beautiful things

28:47.568 --> 28:49.709
so Indians don’t understand the value
of antiques.

28:49.910 --> 28:53.083
They don’t understand how these people
are so mad

28:53.284 --> 28:58.164
after torn things and broken things and
dirty things and filthy things!

28:58.365 --> 29:01.533
But the Western mind has been brought up
that way.

29:01.734 --> 29:03.620
Now, in these antique things I have seen
that,

29:03.821 --> 29:06.092
once I went to somebody’s house, you see,

29:06.293 --> 29:09.635
and he asked Me with very great honour
to sit on his chair.

29:09.836 --> 29:12.476
And as soon as I sat on the chair I thought
there were snakes

29:12.677 --> 29:15.396
and there were scorpions all biting Me.

29:15.597 --> 29:17.942
I got a fright, I got up. I said, “What
is it?”

29:18.143 --> 29:20.811
He said, “This is from great, great,
great grandmother, you see,

29:21.012 --> 29:26.545
she gave us this thing.” I said, “It will
break, I’d better sit outside.”

29:27.332 --> 29:30.708
So this also madness of this antique
is so much

29:30.909 --> 29:36.316
that it is unbelievable how people go
into it.

29:36.517 --> 29:41.496
So there’s a joke in India there’s a very
great writer

29:41.697 --> 29:45.326
called as Premchand, he wrote about two
Englishmen

29:45.527 --> 29:52.538
going on the road of Benares when they were
hit by a lota (metal pot),

29:52.739 --> 29:59.549
that they use for their bathrooms, fell
on their feet. And it fell on their feet.

29:59.749 --> 30:05.195
And jokingly he says, “on the feet where
all the bureaucrats fall.”

30:05.396 --> 30:08.552
Means, all Indian bureaucrats used to fall
at the feet of the English at that time!

30:08.753 --> 30:11.103
So he made a joke. But doesn’t matter.

30:11.304 --> 30:13.091
Then the English, you see, looked at that
thing

30:13.291 --> 30:15.506
and they were very angry and immediately
they took to law,

30:15.707 --> 30:19.066
“You have to come to the courts, you have
to come to the police

30:19.267 --> 30:23.739
and we’re going to report this has fallen
there, it has hit us,” and all that.

30:23.940 --> 30:28.375
So there was a clever man, he knew
the English or the Western mind,

30:28.576 --> 30:34.452
he said, “Sir, do you know this, this lota
has very valuable!” He said, “Why?”

30:34.653 --> 30:39.785
“Because this one was used by Akbar
the Great. So ancient it is”.

30:39.986 --> 30:44.540
He said, “Really?” “Yes it is and, you
know, you just don’t quarrel with them.

30:44.740 --> 30:49.145
And ask them for this lota.” And he told
in Indian language to them that,

30:49.346 --> 30:54.288
“I have befooled these people, I have told
them that this lota belonged to Akbar

30:54.489 --> 31:04.115
and you have to take this lota and use this
lota to just to befool them.”

31:04.316 --> 31:07.209
So then they asked, “But alright, we’ll
forgive you,

31:07.410 --> 31:12.416
we’ll not take you to any courts or
anything, but you just give us this lota.”

31:12.617 --> 31:14.713
They said, “No, we can’t.” He said, “Why?”

31:14.914 --> 31:16.444
“Because it’s such an antique piece,
you see.”

31:16.645 --> 31:19.355
In India you won’t find anybody respecting
antique pieces,

31:19.556 --> 31:22.347
especially in Benares nobody bothers.

31:22.548 --> 31:25.708
So they said, “Really?”, “Yes, it belonged
to Akbar

31:25.908 --> 31:29.466
and, you know, my father was, my
forefathers worked with him,

31:29.667 --> 31:32.317
so he gave us this lota, we can’t give you,
we are sorry, you see.”

31:32.518 --> 31:36.109
“No, no, no, no, please give us, you see,
and we’ll no take you to the police.”

31:36.310 --> 31:38.962
“Alright, you charge us, whatever money
you charge us,” and all that.

31:39.163 --> 31:41.682
In those days they paid one thousand
rupees, you see,

31:41.883 --> 31:44.110
this is equal to, now, one crore
(10 million), I think.

31:44.311 --> 31:47.740
They gave, these English paid them and
bought that lota,

31:47.940 --> 31:52.213
which had nothing to do with Akbar or
anyone.

31:52.414 --> 31:56.043
So this madness of antique has to go away
from our minds.

31:56.244 --> 32:02.447
It’s such a built-in thing within us, that
we always talk of antiquities.

32:02.648 --> 32:05.561
Perhaps maybe because of wars everything
was destroyed

32:05.762 --> 32:09.476
and whatever was in the olden times was
something very beautiful and good

32:09.677 --> 32:13.298
and now we are not making very good
things, perhaps, maybe that is the reason.

32:13.499 --> 32:16.318
But now we are making nice things, we can
make.

32:16.519 --> 32:19.643
Now in England I was surprised the old
crafts are coming up,

32:19.844 --> 32:22.395
everywhere I go the old crafts are coming
up.

32:22.596 --> 32:29.373
So to respect antiques means you just
stop making the old craft revive.

32:29.574 --> 32:31.517
Because you pay so much to the antiques,

32:31.717 --> 32:36.230
the same thing made today won’t fetch
the same price as it was.

32:36.431 --> 32:39.923
Now this has ruined our creativity,

32:40.124 --> 32:46.037
ruined our handwork and it has ruined our
whole – I think the quality of our life,

32:46.237 --> 32:50.106
because the way we are mad after antiques.

32:50.307 --> 32:56.371
So this also should go from your head that
anything antique is something good.

32:56.572 --> 33:00.468
It’s a very superficial value – if you see
to it.

33:00.669 --> 33:03.767
Because people think that antique is
something expensive.

33:03.968 --> 33:07.614
It’s just a marketing style that people
have felt

33:07.815 --> 33:11.009
that this is expensive, that is expensive,
so it’s something great

33:11.210 --> 33:18.407
to wear something stupid and to say that,
“this is antique jewellery,” and go about.

33:18.608 --> 33:21.914
I mean, God knows how many people must
have used it and must have worn it

33:22.115 --> 33:25.082
and what must be the feelings of that
person.

33:25.283 --> 33:30.386
So we have to understand that this
conditioning that we have in our heads,

33:30.587 --> 33:39.924
that we must have something antiques with
us, keep something of such value.

33:40.125 --> 33:43.865
I mean, these questions never arose before,
so it’s not written in any books.

33:44.066 --> 33:48.840
Anyone of the books of the Gurus is not
written that, “Don’t care for antiques.”

33:49.041 --> 33:52.820
They have written, “Don’t drink, don’t
smoke,”

33:53.021 --> 33:55.941
all other things which spoils your Nabhi.

33:56.142 --> 33:58.389
They’ve written all these things. But they
have not written

33:58.590 --> 34:01.408
that, “Don’t worry about antiques so much.”

34:01.609 --> 34:04.302
You see, and I find that’s a craze nowadays

34:04.503 --> 34:08.710
and so we have to tell people that we have
to be careful.

34:08.911 --> 34:12.073
Moreover I feel the way people have gone
to drugs and that,

34:12.274 --> 34:14.167
maybe that because they used so much
antiques

34:14.367 --> 34:17.250
that the bhoots from the antiques must
have caught them.

34:17.451 --> 34:20.192
Can’t understand that why people are
so melancholy,

34:20.393 --> 34:22.555
all the time crying, weeping, and all that.

34:22.756 --> 34:27.366
So the conditionings of these matter as
we think it to be

34:27.567 --> 34:30.415
is to be absolutely taken out.

34:30.616 --> 34:33.469
Of course, I mean in certain countries
we should say

34:33.670 --> 34:36.532
that the antique things [that] were made
were good and nice.

34:36.733 --> 34:39.997
But, only because something is antique it
should not be respected,

34:40.198 --> 34:46.511
[but] because of its intrinsic value
of aesthetics, it’s alright.

34:46.712 --> 34:51.493
But one has to see first of all
the vibrations of everything.

34:51.694 --> 34:55.561
If the vibrations are good then you should
accept, otherwise not,

34:55.762 --> 34:59.525
because we have the language of vibrations

34:59.726 --> 35:04.562
and we have to use the language
of vibrations.

35:04.763 --> 35:08.781
Once you start using the language
of vibrations you’ll be surprised

35:08.982 --> 35:15.498
how you will get the complete picture
as to what is to be done.

35:19.524 --> 35:26.458
So to get rid of these three conditionings
too, for our body is very important.

35:26.659 --> 35:32.930
And the worst thing for a Sahaja Yogi [is]
to think that he’s sick:

35:33.131 --> 35:37.916
is a, sort of a, tarnishing the name
of Sahaja Yoga.

35:38.117 --> 35:43.233
If you still feel you are sick you better
get out of Sahaja Yoga!

35:43.906 --> 35:50.588
Because either you get well or you are not
a Sahaja Yogi, one of the two things.

35:50.789 --> 35:53.647
If you are a Sahaja Yogi you have to see
that you get well

35:53.848 --> 35:56.775
and if there are certain problems also –
doesn’t matter.

35:56.976 --> 36:00.252
Now, for example, supposing, I have certain
problems,

36:00.453 --> 36:03.066
which I know, because of Sahaja Yoga,

36:03.267 --> 36:08.356
because of My position as the Mother,
position as Adi Shakti:

36:08.587 --> 36:11.030
certain physical things I have to face,

36:11.231 --> 36:13.846
parasympathetic working I have to face,

36:14.047 --> 36:16.647
but I go through it! Is accepted.

36:16.848 --> 36:21.348
You have to accept your body as it is
and you are not to sort of say that,

36:21.548 --> 36:24.264
“I’m not well,” and “There’s something
rong with me,”

36:24.465 --> 36:28.167
and go on complaining like some old hag!

36:28.368 --> 36:30.940
Never think you are old, first of all.

36:31.141 --> 36:35.953
Never think that you have gone old or you
are no good.

36:36.154 --> 36:38.566
Look at your Mother. I never think that
way.

36:38.767 --> 36:42.526
Yesterday half of you were sleeping, still
I was alert

36:42.727 --> 36:45.843
and listening to the music and today I’m
again alert here.

36:46.044 --> 36:50.404
So if you have a Guru then that image
should be with you that:

36:50.605 --> 36:54.861
“Look at our Mother. She’s so old, how much
She travels, how much She does!”

36:55.062 --> 36:56.984
Alright, you might say, She’s the Adi
Shakti!

36:57.185 --> 36:59.573
But little bit of shakti you too have.

36:59.774 --> 37:06.310
And that shakti is to be shown by your
full dynamism.

37:06.511 --> 37:09.993
If you have no dynamism and if you still
feel very weak

37:10.194 --> 37:12.126
that means you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

37:12.327 --> 37:18.061
So just ask for, ask for any amount of
energy – it can come to you.

37:18.262 --> 37:19.926
That dynamism, it should be there.

37:20.127 --> 37:23.495
Now this I would say, for the physical
self that one has to know

37:23.696 --> 37:26.856
that you are all younger and getting
younger and younger,

37:27.057 --> 37:33.291
but not the stupidity of youth, but
gravity, the gravity of the age.

37:33.492 --> 37:38.133
Actually I have seen children who are
born realised,

37:38.334 --> 37:44.270
they are very grave, they won’t do anything
that is not dignified.

37:44.471 --> 37:49.492
And they will never, I’ve never heard them
talking to some of –

37:49.693 --> 37:51.261
the Sahaja Yoginis have a bad habit
of talking,

37:51.462 --> 37:52.970
“tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk,” among
themselves.

37:53.171 --> 37:58.541
It’s a very bad habit. Which shows that
they [are] still very much lacking.

37:58.742 --> 38:02.290
Just wearing saris or wearing bindis you do
not become a Sahaja Yogini.

38:02.491 --> 38:04.054
First of all, what is the gravity?

38:04.254 --> 38:06.970
You should only speak whenever it is
necessary.

38:07.171 --> 38:11.976
So I have seen these Sahaja Yogis who are
born realised children

38:12.177 --> 38:14.135
they stand like this before Me.

38:14.336 --> 38:18.554
And they say very few words, but beautiful
words they speak.

38:18.755 --> 38:22.622
And say things, which you can remember
all the time.

38:22.823 --> 38:25.815
They just do not go on wasting anything.

38:26.016 --> 38:28.071
And they are extremely obedient.

38:28.272 --> 38:31.567
So from them one can learn that these are
born realised

38:31.768 --> 38:37.039
and the way their Guru principle is acting,
are we also acting the same way?

38:37.240 --> 38:41.236
Or we are doing something that is not good
for our ascent?

38:41.437 --> 38:44.894
So even after coming to Sahaja Yoga if you
do not try hard

38:45.095 --> 38:47.798
to introspect yourself, you have missed
the point

38:47.999 --> 38:50.620
that you compare yourself with your Guru –
all the time.

38:50.821 --> 38:55.361
Now. Then everything has to be understood

38:55.561 --> 38:58.803
in the right perspective that we are Sahaja
Yogis.

38:59.004 --> 39:01.165
Now for a Sahaja Yogi first and foremost
thing

39:01.366 --> 39:07.716
[is] that he has to have love. First. For
others, not for himself.

39:07.917 --> 39:10.255
If you are all the time worried about
yourself,

39:10.456 --> 39:13.638
“My body is such, my this thing such, and
I have to do this and that,”

39:13.839 --> 39:18.163
then you don’t love others. But do you see
to the comfort of others?

39:18.364 --> 39:21.271
Do you feel the compassion of other
Sahaja Yogis?

39:21.472 --> 39:24.720
Do you feel, “What have I to bring for
them? What is missing in them?”

39:24.921 --> 39:30.877
Do you work it out? Do you go out of
the way to help them?

39:31.147 --> 39:36.970
First of all Sahaja Yogis. Now Sahaja
Yogis are different things.

39:37.171 --> 39:41.744
I have seen many Sahaja Yogis will go and
take the side of the non-Sahaja Yogis

39:41.945 --> 39:45.724
and try to debase the Sahaja Yogis.
Is a very wrong thing.

39:45.925 --> 39:48.611
You belong to this new race

39:48.812 --> 39:53.128
and the people who do not belong to this
new race and if they are attacking anybody:

39:53.329 --> 39:57.445
these are your hands, your feet, your head,
and if they attack it,

39:57.646 --> 40:02.409
it is duty bound that you help them instead
of helping the others.

40:02.610 --> 40:05.099
Maybe something wrong with this person,
doesn’t matter.

40:05.300 --> 40:08.090
You need not show all the fair play there.

40:08.291 --> 40:11.745
In that place you should support a Sahaja
Yogi out and out.

40:11.946 --> 40:14.862
Later on you may correct and you may
tell that person,

40:15.063 --> 40:18.140
“You should not have done like this,
it was wrong.”

40:18.341 --> 40:23.083
So this dignity and this understanding
comes only through silence.

40:23.284 --> 40:27.810
But if you are chirping all the time,
talking “tuktuk, tuktuk, tuktuk, tuktuk,”

40:28.011 --> 40:32.210
it can never, never can make you a deeper
person.

40:32.411 --> 40:35.064
You’ll be just flying in the air with
all that.

40:35.265 --> 40:37.955
So for women now is best is to take
to mauna,

40:38.156 --> 40:41.149
is to keep quiet, just keep quiet.

40:41.350 --> 40:43.396
They all the time want to talk.

40:43.597 --> 40:47.950
This I’ve heard from all the leaders that
it’s a big problem with women.

40:48.151 --> 40:51.279
They just go on talking stories, telling
stories.

40:51.480 --> 40:57.851
But if you ask them to come and speak,
they will start shaking.

40:58.244 --> 41:03.697
How many can give speeches? Women?

41:03.898 --> 41:11.381
If you understand that if you cannot give
a speech, you better not talk also.

41:11.842 --> 41:15.861
You should be able to give a speech because
your Mother is a woman, She gives speeches.

41:16.062 --> 41:18.205
Why can’t you give some speech? You cannot.

41:18.406 --> 41:21.120
If I make you stand here, you’ll be
shaking, I know that.

41:21.321 --> 41:24.822
But if it comes to murmuring souls, you
are there.

41:25.023 --> 41:27.706
So that is one thing women have to be very
careful [about].

41:27.907 --> 41:30.599
And as today is the Guru puja I have
to tell you things,

41:30.800 --> 41:33.728
not as a Mother but as your Guru.

41:33.929 --> 41:38.510
That, if you have to ascend the best thing
is for you to stop talking.

41:38.711 --> 41:42.651
“Maunam sarvartha sadhanam.” ‘Maun’ means
to keep quiet.

41:42.852 --> 41:49.142
It gives you all kinds of facilities, just
keep quiet.

41:49.343 --> 41:52.478
If somebody’s talking too much, just keep
quiet.

41:52.679 --> 41:55.243
If somebody’s trying to criticise, keep
quiet.

41:55.444 --> 41:57.276
That’s your silence, that’s your right,

41:57.476 --> 42:00.883
that’s your domain that you can keep
silent.

42:01.084 --> 42:02.991
Just watch that person.

42:03.192 --> 42:07.708
If it comes then to answer, then you can
answer better.

42:07.909 --> 42:12.442
But if somebody’s trying to attack, you
just keep silent.

42:12.643 --> 42:14.963
But this silence has to be established

42:15.164 --> 42:19.061
and one should only establish by not
talking too much.

42:19.262 --> 42:23.732
I have seen also when I am sitting here, I
have seen women talking among themselves,

42:23.933 --> 42:27.459
and this is very wrong. You must learn
the silence.

42:27.660 --> 42:31.305
Like yesterday I saw so many ladies also
were walking out, walking in.

42:31.506 --> 42:34.864
In the church will you do that? You won’t
do it.

42:35.065 --> 42:38.845
In the church there is no Christ, there’s
a horrible priest sitting there

42:39.046 --> 42:43.413
but you cannot do it. You all keep quiet,
you sit there nicely.

42:43.614 --> 42:46.346
I’ve never seen anybody walking out here
and there

42:46.547 --> 42:49.962
and doing all kinds of things, putting
the children in front like that,

42:50.163 --> 42:54.999
making them sleep. Never! Can you do that
in the church?

42:56.709 --> 43:01.099
What a discipline people observe in that
church, which is an artificial place.

43:01.300 --> 43:06.083
And where you are now, that kind of
a silence has to be there

43:06.284 --> 43:09.869
and that kind of understanding, that depth,
that awe has to be there.

43:10.070 --> 43:12.555
But because we have not yet developed
that Guru thing.

43:12.756 --> 43:15.407
If you have developed it then immediately
it will work out.

43:15.608 --> 43:19.857
You will see your gravity will show in your
behaviour.

43:20.058 --> 43:33.111
So this is for our attention not to be
wasted.

43:33.312 --> 43:37.279
To discuss somebody, to discuss about
others’ characters, we have no business.

43:37.480 --> 43:41.219
Do we discuss the character of one hand
to another hand?

43:41.420 --> 43:44.963
To discuss about what has happened about
marriages, things like that.

43:45.164 --> 43:49.936
Also marriage is just… in Sahaja Yoga it’s
not such an important thing.

43:50.137 --> 43:52.379
Some people pay too much attention
to marriage, you see,

43:52.580 --> 43:55.846
and marriage becomes a headache. Also
then, “What about my marriage?”

43:56.047 --> 43:58.915
Then again ten minutes you see that person,
“What about my marriage?”

43:59.116 --> 44:00.964
Again after ten minutes, “What about
my marriage?”

44:01.165 --> 44:03.961
You want to run away. I mean, you see,

44:04.162 --> 44:07.892
it’s something becomes like a mania for
people, “What should we do?”

44:08.108 --> 44:11.264
And the whole thing is, all depends, and
the whole programming

44:11.464 --> 44:13.993
depends on how you are going to get
married.

44:14.194 --> 44:19.485
So you have come to Sahaja Yoga, you
are sanyasis.

44:21.477 --> 44:24.321
You are not married people in a way.

44:24.522 --> 44:26.404
You are married only to Sahaja Yoga,

44:26.605 --> 44:28.961
that’s your husband, that’s your wife.

44:29.162 --> 44:32.959
And the so-called husband and wife are
there.

44:33.160 --> 44:37.677
But if they are not Sahaja Yogis then you
are unmarried, definitely.

44:37.878 --> 44:41.023
So too much attention is paid in Sahaja
Yoga to marriages.

44:41.224 --> 44:47.363
I have seen that before, marriage, before
Sahaja Yoga,

44:47.564 --> 44:51.132
marriage was a joke; every third day there
was a divorce

44:51.333 --> 44:55.758
and people would run away and do all kinds
of things.

44:55.959 --> 44:59.900
Then when they got married after Sahaja
Yoga

45:00.101 --> 45:03.426
they are the greatest romantic people ever
known in the whole world!

45:03.627 --> 45:06.985
I mean, all ‘Romeo, Juliets’ going about.
I just don’t understand.

45:07.186 --> 45:09.373
Even in the Indian villages people complain
that,

45:09.574 --> 45:12.600
“What sort of these people are? I mean,
they have no sense at all

45:12.801 --> 45:15.478
and the way they go round, are they
the saints?”

45:15.679 --> 45:22.731
So that saintliness, that sanyasta, that
asceticism

45:22.931 --> 45:25.410
has to be expressed in our married life.

45:25.611 --> 45:28.787
I don’t mean that you don’t have
relationship with your husband

45:28.988 --> 45:33.585
but in a very private way. It’s has to be
extremely private

45:33.786 --> 45:38.416
and it should not be such a great thing
to go into romanticism.

45:38.617 --> 45:42.784
You’ll ruin the whole of Sahaja Yoga in the
West if you start doing that nonsense!

45:42.985 --> 45:49.030
Because also there’s an idea about it that,
you see, you fall in love.

45:49.231 --> 45:51.714
But then you’ll fall! That’s the first
point is.

45:51.915 --> 45:53.694
You will fall [but] you want to rise.

45:53.895 --> 45:58.647
So this attachment and this worry about
the husband and this and that,

45:58.848 --> 46:02.053
I mean, you can carry on with any kind of a
husband and wife if you are a Sahaja Yogi,

46:02.254 --> 46:06.315
should be able to. I mean, I know that’s
very simple.

46:06.516 --> 46:09.631
It’s a… your husband is a study, wife is
a study, that’s all.

46:09.832 --> 46:12.101
You study a person, what sort of a person
he is.

46:12.302 --> 46:14.536
But for that you have to have the witness
state

46:14.737 --> 46:16.678
and you have to see, you have to be
detached.

46:16.879 --> 46:20.673
So in marriages one has to be detached.

46:20.874 --> 46:24.322
But, on the contrary, I find that just
after the marriage

46:24.522 --> 46:27.302
they want to organise some special thing
for them

46:27.503 --> 46:33.083
to go to some sort of a honeymoon or some
sort of a thing!

46:33.284 --> 46:35.241
I don’t know how these ideas crawl up.

46:35.442 --> 46:38.209
These are coming from the old conditionings
of things

46:38.410 --> 46:40.029
and after honeymoon they come and say,

46:40.230 --> 46:42.431
“Mother, this marriage is not going
to work out.”

46:42.632 --> 46:46.420
So it’s better to do slow and steady and
then decide.

46:46.621 --> 46:49.822
Because you just jump into honeymoon mood
and come back and say,

46:50.023 --> 46:54.135
“Mother, this, I have started thinking and
I don’t think.”

46:54.336 --> 46:58.600
I know of a lady who was jumping with
a Indian gentleman

46:58.800 --> 47:02.356
and she was on her way to Australia. In
Singapore, she telephones that,

47:02.557 --> 47:05.146
“Mother, I don’t think this marriage will
work out.”

47:05.347 --> 47:07.427
And here everybody complained to Me,
“Mother,

47:07.628 --> 47:13.064
these two are behaving in such a manner
that Indians are rather embarrassed.”

47:13.265 --> 47:16.786
So the sense of shame you must learn
from Indians.

47:16.987 --> 47:20.808
They’d never… husband and wife never sit
together in India

47:21.009 --> 47:24.063
is regarded as bad manners and it should
be with you also.

47:24.264 --> 47:28.864
That, even in the puja, even in anything
they are sitting in the public.

47:29.071 --> 47:33.223
What is the need to show your relationship
in the public?

47:33.424 --> 47:36.417
It’s only in the private. This is one
of the things one,

47:36.618 --> 47:40.788
if you start understanding, there will be
a proper adjustment.

47:40.989 --> 47:43.973
Men should be with men in the public,

47:44.174 --> 47:48.118
women should be with the women together.

47:48.319 --> 47:51.125
But the women or men, whatever they are

47:51.326 --> 47:57.741
whatever are their bad, bad points should
not be brought back.

47:57.942 --> 48:05.242
Like, I would say the men have jealousies
and they have power orientation

48:05.443 --> 48:10.471
and they discuss about leadership and they,
every, they get a shock

48:10.672 --> 48:12.692
if you tell them that you are not going
to be a leader,

48:12.892 --> 48:16.063
as if they think leadership is something
very concrete.

48:16.264 --> 48:20.121
It’s the greatest myth ever going, is this
leadership!

48:20.322 --> 48:25.325
There’s nothing like leaders in this Sahaja
Yoga, it’s just a joke.

48:25.526 --> 48:28.798
And your Mother is very good at playing
serious jokes.

48:28.999 --> 48:33.732
So be careful! Don’t be childish about it.

48:33.933 --> 48:36.688
You have to understand that this is a big
joke going on

48:36.889 --> 48:42.040
and it’s just a testing point and if I test
you wrong,

48:42.241 --> 48:44.372
you can tell Me, but I think this has
worked well,

48:44.573 --> 48:47.166
because I can test people very well on that
level

48:47.366 --> 48:51.735
and immediately I know when the person
gets onto the horse of ego.

48:51.936 --> 48:56.883
So, for your mental attitude, has to be
different

48:57.084 --> 49:00.426
and our priorities have to change.

49:00.627 --> 49:03.675
Our priorities have to change. What are
our priorities?

49:03.876 --> 49:09.093
First and foremost thing is our ascent, is
the first priority.

49:09.294 --> 49:11.756
For our ascent whatever is needed has to be
done.

49:11.957 --> 49:13.989
If you have to punish your body, alright.

49:14.190 --> 49:16.500
If you have to punish yourself, alright.

49:16.701 --> 49:23.410
If you have a conditioning, get rid of it.
Just introspect yourself,

49:23.611 --> 49:26.455
that is Self-realisation, is to know your
Self.

49:26.656 --> 49:28.052
When you know your Self and know

49:28.253 --> 49:33.261
what is clinging onto it, just to remove it
completely.

49:33.462 --> 49:36.354
Work it out the way you like. Work it out
the way you like.

49:36.555 --> 49:46.971
You see, it is very important that
the body, mind,

49:47.836 --> 49:51.822
everything should be your slaves.

49:52.023 --> 49:56.881
Nothing should dominate you. You should be
on top of everything.

49:57.082 --> 49:59.863
How dare your body ask for anything?

50:00.064 --> 50:02.906
How dare your mind tells you anything?

50:03.107 --> 50:05.249
How this conditioning works on you?

50:05.450 --> 50:07.967
“I am a Sahaja Yogi, I’m above everything.”

50:08.168 --> 50:13.456
Like the lotuses have come out of the
ponds, you have come out of it.

50:13.657 --> 50:19.692
We have so many proofs to show that you
are realised souls.

50:19.893 --> 50:23.816
I’ll show you some photographs that I have
to show that there is light.

50:24.017 --> 50:27.042
I can put light into you, they are all
enlightened people.

50:27.243 --> 50:29.379
But in My presence if you become the light,

50:29.580 --> 50:31.277
you must carry the light outside.

50:31.478 --> 50:34.447
Not only in My presence, but when you go
out.

50:34.648 --> 50:39.110
But one of the reasons, I think, when I
tell something people just start thinking

50:39.311 --> 50:43.757
about whom Mother is talking, they never
think, “She is talking about me.

50:43.958 --> 50:46.765
That’s the only way you can penetrate
within yourself

50:46.966 --> 50:49.225
when you see that, “Mother is talking
about me,

50:49.426 --> 50:52.316
She’s correcting me all alone and She’s
telling me.”

50:52.517 --> 50:56.421
Then only it will penetrate and it will
work out.

50:56.622 --> 51:00.366
The priorities have to be changed and
the first and foremost

51:00.567 --> 51:04.406
is your ascent and the Spirit and Sahaja
Yoga.

51:04.607 --> 51:09.311
The rest is negligible, nothing important.

51:11.891 --> 51:19.195
Then the faith that there is this
All-pervading Power,

51:19.396 --> 51:23.235
which is looking after us, is very
important.

51:23.436 --> 51:25.207
This time the musicians came all the way.

51:25.408 --> 51:27.721
I must tell you the story of their travel.

51:27.925 --> 51:31.518
They came and they said that there’s
a train from Kiev

51:31.719 --> 51:34.208
and they also bought the tickets so got
into the train

51:34.409 --> 51:39.617
and they were off-loaded before
the Hungarian border.

51:39.818 --> 51:43.006
They didn’t know what to do, they had
no visas, nothing

51:43.207 --> 51:46.029
and not so much money also. They thought,
“We are on the train.”

51:46.230 --> 51:48.205
They said, “No, you have to go cross over

51:48.406 --> 51:50.125
and go to Budapest,” and they didn’t
know where,

51:50.325 --> 51:54.353
they were standing on the road. And,
but they were all laughing

51:54.554 --> 51:57.666
and enjoying, “must be something in store
for us.”

51:57.867 --> 52:00.209
Nobody felt that they were in trouble
or in anything.

52:00.410 --> 52:03.194
So surrendered. “So, suddenly,” they said,

52:03.395 --> 52:05.687
“the custom people came and surrounded
them,” and they said,

52:05.888 --> 52:10.068
“What’s the matter, how are you here
with all these bags and baggage?”

52:10.269 --> 52:14.003
So they said, “Why are you here?” They
said, “We have come for a concert and this,

52:14.204 --> 52:18.346
and musicians we are and all.” And some
or other they started melting away.

52:18.547 --> 52:20.455
And then they gave them Realisation!

52:20.656 --> 52:24.877
Six of them got Realisation. Now can you
believe: the power of love.

52:25.078 --> 52:30.993
And the custom officers they offered their
own cars, took them down to the other side.

52:31.194 --> 52:33.695
It’s never happened with custom officers!
Imagine!

52:33.896 --> 52:37.385
It would be like shaving their teeth off,
I tell you,

52:37.586 --> 52:43.897
the way if you can do that to the custom
officer! But it happened.

52:44.098 --> 52:47.098
And they came to the other side and left
them there.

52:47.299 --> 52:49.635
Now they didn’t know what to do. They
wanted to go to Budapest,

52:49.836 --> 52:53.533
they had to walk about two miles or
something to the station.

52:53.734 --> 52:58.503
So they were waiting there well, they
said that, “Mother, You sent maybe,

52:58.704 --> 53:04.579
two Yugoslavs came in a big bus of 49
people – all vacant.”

53:04.780 --> 53:07.738
They stopped the bus and said, “What is it,
why are you here?”

53:07.939 --> 53:09.939
So they said, “This is our problem and we
have to go.”

53:10.140 --> 53:13.443
So they got into the bus. When he was
driving them down,

53:13.644 --> 53:17.456
they thought of talking to him that, “Why
not you take us to Milan?”

53:17.657 --> 53:20.648
And they managed!

53:21.756 --> 53:25.717
And they were in Milan. It’s so remarkable.

53:25.918 --> 53:29.287
So to have faith completely in yourself

53:29.488 --> 53:33.273
and in that Power, which is surrounding
you.

53:33.474 --> 53:37.431
And once you have that faith you will
realise that,

53:37.632 --> 53:42.097
that, though it is so helpful to you, it is
so kind to you,

53:42.298 --> 53:50.219
on the same level if you think it, it can
be very harmful.

53:50.420 --> 53:55.045
So then never listen to the Guruninda,

53:55.246 --> 53:58.022
means anybody talks anything ill about
your Guru,

53:58.223 --> 54:03.003
just put your hands to your ears,
absolutely, immediately.

54:03.204 --> 54:06.026
I have known of a person who did that
[and] got cancer,

54:06.227 --> 54:08.661
another now in jail, another one there.

54:08.862 --> 54:11.872
So anybody is saying like that just put
your hands.

54:12.073 --> 54:16.199
Because now you know that – what is your
Guru.

54:16.400 --> 54:22.267
So you should never hear anything against
your Guru from anyone.

54:22.468 --> 54:25.766
The other day one gentleman asked Me
a question, a newsman.

54:25.967 --> 54:29.516
He said that, “I am told you have made
a castle for Yourself.”

54:29.717 --> 54:31.681
I said, “I have paid for it, I have made it
also.

54:31.882 --> 54:34.903
It was a horrid place, no doubt. But there
are only Sahaja Yogis staying there,

54:35.104 --> 54:39.040
I am not staying there. That’s the best
part.” But that’s all I said.

54:39.241 --> 54:44.285
But on the contrary, they never go and ask
these questions to any gurus on anything.

54:44.486 --> 54:47.331
Because the disciples say, “Yes, so what?
We want to give

54:47.532 --> 54:50.204
to our guru money and this and that.”
They never ask.

54:50.405 --> 54:53.832
But, through Sahaja Yoga, or [by] Myself,
have cured

54:54.033 --> 54:58.134
so many people of incurable diseases –
I could have minted money.

54:58.335 --> 55:03.308
For curing one cancer patient I could have
made a castle, Myself.

55:03.509 --> 55:05.302
So when people say like that you should
say,

55:05.502 --> 55:09.475
“Do you know how many people She has
cured? How much money She could have taken

55:09.675 --> 55:14.891
from them if She was a doctor or She was
a false guru?

55:15.092 --> 55:18.030
How much money She would have made
out of all of them?”

55:18.231 --> 55:20.890
Then they will understand. You see, because
they are being

55:21.091 --> 55:25.998
materialistic they talk like that. And
their attitude is very different

55:26.216 --> 55:28.924
and so, to tell them off is the best way.

55:29.125 --> 55:34.442
Because I have seen that these press people
are absolutely harassed

55:34.643 --> 55:39.697
by the disciples of the false Gurus. Just
they cannot criticise,

55:39.898 --> 55:42.322
they cannot say a word against such
false Gurus.

55:42.523 --> 55:45.548
While I find that Sahaja Yogis still lack

55:45.748 --> 55:51.790
that complete faith in themselves and
complete assertion.

55:51.991 --> 55:55.491
Where you have to assert you must assert.

55:55.692 --> 56:00.476
For example, anybody says something wrong
against Me, you have to assert;

56:00.677 --> 56:04.858
must say, “No, not possible. It’s not!” But
I have seen some people

56:05.058 --> 56:08.674
asking Me funny questions who are ‘Sahaja
Yogis’ also!

56:08.875 --> 56:17.003
So the first part is that to see how much
we are sensitive to spirituality.

56:17.204 --> 56:20.732
I have seen Sahaja Yogis supporting
somebody who is so negative,

56:20.932 --> 56:26.284
you can’t even bear that person and, [to
them], such a person is something great,

56:26.485 --> 56:29.849
while somebody who is so good they cannot
make it out.

56:30.050 --> 56:33.425
So what’s the use? Your computer is so
faulty, you’ll do…

56:33.626 --> 56:35.719
I mean, the planes will have to run up
and down

56:35.919 --> 56:38.592
if you have such a computer as Sahaja
Yogis are!

56:38.806 --> 56:41.610
Because they just judge the other way
round.

56:41.811 --> 56:45.286
A person who is good in Sahaja Yoga, who
has got vibrations,

56:45.486 --> 56:47.599
he may be simple, he may be unassuming,

56:47.800 --> 56:50.500
he may not be so rich, he may not be
so educated,

56:50.701 --> 56:54.073
may not be from some good universities
or anything,

56:54.274 --> 56:57.038
but you must see the vibrations of that
person!

56:57.239 --> 57:01.018
What sort of vibrations that person has,
and then you should judge.

57:01.219 --> 57:06.312
Instead of that if you judge that person
only because he’s very good to talk

57:06.513 --> 57:10.822
and he talks well and very scholarly or
something like that, that’s not the point.

57:11.023 --> 57:14.620
The point is what are his vibrations! And
once you see those vibrations

57:14.821 --> 57:18.355
and judge them on vibrations, then you are
a Sahaja Yogi,

57:18.556 --> 57:21.161
otherwise I would not call you at all
a Sahaja Yogi.

57:21.399 --> 57:24.666
But for a Guru it is very important.
I have seen sometimes

57:24.867 --> 57:28.979
even the leaders supporting somebody
who is absolutely horrid!

57:29.180 --> 57:32.209
I can’t bear that person even for five
minutes!

57:32.410 --> 57:34.602
But here the guru sends him over to Me,

57:34.803 --> 57:39.485
“Oh, Mother, he’s so good, you know, he
donated so much money.”

57:39.686 --> 57:42.726
It doesn’t matter. You donated money,
so what?

57:42.927 --> 57:44.763
Who asked him to donate money?

57:44.964 --> 57:47.750
But he should not donate his bhoots to us
now anymore!

57:47.951 --> 57:50.338
We don’t want his bhoot! So that’s what
it is.

57:50.539 --> 57:53.736
So the judgment should be correct about
a person

57:53.937 --> 57:57.625
when you say that this man is not good
or that is not good.

57:57.826 --> 58:00.201
But mostly ‘gurus’ themselves are caught up

58:00.402 --> 58:05.164
and then they are ambitious and if somebody
doesn’t listen to them

58:05.365 --> 58:08.792
or somebody wants to give a lecture
at a wrong time and somebody says,

58:08.993 --> 58:12.084
“You shouldn’t talk like this,” or
something, then they get angry.

58:12.285 --> 58:16.788
They are very hot tempered and they provoke
people, they say things sometimes.

58:16.989 --> 58:19.919
And then when people react they say,
“You are a bad Sahaja Yogi.”

58:20.120 --> 58:23.762
That’s not the way. First of all a guru
or a leader

58:23.963 --> 58:29.926
has to be himself a very mild, gentle, and
a good person.

58:30.127 --> 58:33.012
He has to be in such a way [that] he should
not demand anything,

58:33.213 --> 58:36.686
should not ask for anything. Never demand
anything!

58:36.887 --> 58:41.671
Anybody who demands cannot be a guru.

58:41.989 --> 58:45.041
Respect is to be commanded and not
to be demanded.

58:45.242 --> 58:51.782
And so, everything works out well if you
understand that –

58:51.983 --> 58:55.350
once you rise in your ascent, in your
wisdom,

58:55.550 --> 59:00.306
in your awareness and in your Spirit –
automatically all these things happen!

59:00.515 --> 59:04.107
You don’t have to ask for anything, you
don’t have to plead for anything,

59:04.308 --> 59:06.975
you don’t have to complain for anything,
everything works out.

59:07.176 --> 59:11.640
You are looked after by all the ganas,
by all the angels.

59:11.849 --> 59:14.043
They are there. You are on the stage.

59:14.244 --> 59:16.752
But if you are halfway then they play
tricks with you.

59:16.953 --> 59:20.594
You see, they play tricks, they make you
falter, you have problems,

59:20.795 --> 59:23.890
you go here, you go there, all these
things happen

59:24.091 --> 59:26.315
and then you say, “Mother, how is it
this happened?”

59:26.516 --> 59:30.453
Because they are also jokers, so they play
jokes with you

59:30.654 --> 59:35.280
and they make problems for you just to make
you understand that you are doing wrong.

59:35.481 --> 59:39.998
So we are on a stage where there’s
a beautiful security,

59:40.199 --> 59:44.340
everything is there and we have to give
to the world

59:44.540 --> 59:46.356
such a great thing like Sahaja Yoga,

59:46.557 --> 59:49.917
which is for the emancipation of the whole
world, as you realise,

59:50.118 --> 59:53.438
and so also I hope you realise your
responsibilities.

59:53.655 --> 59:58.717
There are so many things one has to
understand, how one has to be as a guru,

59:58.932 --> 01:00:01.754
how he has to act and how he has to work
out.

01:00:01.955 --> 01:00:04.347
Now I have given so many lectures
on Guru things,

01:00:04.548 --> 01:00:07.880
but, for today’s lecture, only I have
to say

01:00:08.081 --> 01:00:13.475
that, first thing, to have a guru system,

01:00:13.676 --> 01:00:16.396
you must have complete humility.

01:00:16.597 --> 01:00:21.765
Now, with Me, I would say, I am too simple

01:00:21.966 --> 01:00:25.338
and I am Mahamaya, so you be very careful.

01:00:25.554 --> 01:00:29.919
You cannot take liberties with Me. You
cannot take.

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:34.891
If you try to take too much liberties that
means you are not a disciple.

01:00:35.092 --> 01:00:38.983
A disciple has to keep a distance from
the Guru.

01:00:39.184 --> 01:00:41.880
You cannot just take liberties, walk into
My room every time,

01:00:42.081 --> 01:00:45.372
sit there for hours together, chit-chat
with Me – nothing!

01:00:45.573 --> 01:00:47.119
You have no right.

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:52.950
Only when I call you, when I ask for you,
you should come.

01:00:53.151 --> 01:00:55.823
Then you should not force things on
the Guru that,

01:00:56.024 --> 01:01:01.229
“Please, come and listen to this,” or,
“Do this!” that should not be said.

01:01:01.445 --> 01:01:03.804
For example, yesterday nobody told Me there
are going to be

01:01:04.004 --> 01:01:06.479
these music programs or everything
arranged.

01:01:06.688 --> 01:01:11.404
So you have to report everything to your
leader, or to Me,

01:01:11.605 --> 01:01:15.240
all those things that you want to do.
And it should be really transparent.

01:01:15.441 --> 01:01:17.810
Like this hand knows everything that this
hand is doing,

01:01:18.011 --> 01:01:20.249
and this hand knows everything that this
hand is doing.

01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:23.459
In the same way everybody should know
each other.

01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:29.111
Then the gurus should not have jealousies
for each other.

01:01:29.382 --> 01:01:32.911
This I’m just telling you because also
I found out

01:01:33.112 --> 01:01:37.433
that there are certain jealousies. And when
they talk there is a little bit of,

01:01:37.634 --> 01:01:41.175
“Ha, he’s good, but this, this, this.”

01:01:41.376 --> 01:01:43.917
When they enjoy each other’s company

01:01:44.118 --> 01:01:46.539
because they have reached a certain state

01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:48.573
and they understand, “This is the state
we are in.”

01:01:48.774 --> 01:01:53.030
When they enjoy each other’s company fully
and appreciate each other

01:01:53.231 --> 01:01:58.439
much more than anybody else – the guru’s
company.

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:05.287
All the company of the leaders, if they
enjoy each other

01:02:05.488 --> 01:02:09.705
and there’s no jealousy, there’s no fight,
there’s no problem

01:02:09.906 --> 01:02:11.528
but just the enjoyment of the company,

01:02:11.729 --> 01:02:14.488
then they should know that they have
become a guru.

01:02:14.689 --> 01:02:17.739
Now all of them never fought with each
other. They supported.

01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:21.196
Actually it is one Principle was born again
and again.

01:02:21.397 --> 01:02:26.923
But only the satanic people – they’ll fight
among themselves, not the godly.

01:02:27.124 --> 01:02:32.641
And also they will talk against the person
who is a realised soul

01:02:32.842 --> 01:02:35.880
or who is an Incarnation, but never
against themselves.

01:02:36.081 --> 01:02:39.813
It’s very surprising that the satanic
people,

01:02:40.014 --> 01:02:42.203
though they fight among themselves, there
are jealousies,

01:02:42.404 --> 01:02:44.883
they’ll never talk of each other.

01:02:45.084 --> 01:02:48.399
But here I find that in Sahaja Yoga we
have freedom.

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:51.070
But freedom is not abandonment,
is the freedom

01:02:51.294 --> 01:02:54.572
with complete rules and regulations
of the Divine, with us,

01:02:54.835 --> 01:02:58.877
and we have to know them that this is
the Divine Law.

01:02:59.078 --> 01:03:04.876
So all of us are now sitting like in a big
vimana, like an aeroplane,

01:03:05.077 --> 01:03:08.597
and we all have to land into the beautiful
area.

01:03:08.798 --> 01:03:14.903
But first of all we have to develop that
humility in your heart;

01:03:15.104 --> 01:03:18.365
complete humility and surrender, that’s
very important.

01:03:18.566 --> 01:03:22.522
Unless and until you have that humility
and surrender in your heart,

01:03:22.723 --> 01:03:25.637
Guru principle cannot be awakened.

01:03:25.838 --> 01:03:29.404
First you have to be the disciple and then
the guru.

01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:32.158
So you have to develop that humility.

01:03:32.359 --> 01:03:38.950
And that humility comes very easily if
you love Me, respect Me.

01:03:39.151 --> 01:03:43.196
It’s not only love, but respect.

01:03:43.784 --> 01:03:49.914
That respect has to be there and then
people will respect you.

01:03:50.115 --> 01:03:52.484
May God bless you.
