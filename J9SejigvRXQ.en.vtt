00:01:43.743 --> 00:01:48.984
So we have decided… [A little further,

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.124
should be brought little further
(the microphone)],

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:10.625
we have decided to have the puja after
our dinner

00:02:10.872 --> 00:02:16.304
because Shri Krishna was born in the night,
about twelve o’clock,

00:02:16.505 --> 00:02:24.876
while I was born twelve o’clock in
the daytime, same with Shri Rama.

00:02:25.077 --> 00:02:32.577
And also Christ was born twelve o’clock
in the night.

00:02:42.894 --> 00:02:49.635
I’ve told you that today I’m going to tell
you about Gita.

00:02:52.058 --> 00:02:59.762
That is the second part of Krishna’s life.
It’s so different and varied

00:02:59.963 --> 00:03:03.921
that some people, intellectuals as usual,

00:03:04.122 --> 00:03:08.629
say that the Krishna who played as a child
in Gokul

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:16.107
was different from the Krishna who was
the king of Dwarika.

00:03:20.278 --> 00:03:25.490
So when He became the king of Dwarika,

00:03:28.077 --> 00:03:33.046
there was a war between Pandava and
Kauravas,

00:03:33.252 --> 00:03:39.283
one representing the good people, another
representing the bad people.

00:03:42.007 --> 00:03:51.031
So they came to ask Him if He would join
on their side.

00:03:51.232 --> 00:03:57.097
So He said, “I’ve got My army and I’m
Myself,

00:03:57.298 --> 00:04:02.122
so whichever you choose you can have.”

00:04:02.323 --> 00:04:05.248
So Kauravas said, “We’ll have your army,”

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:09.216
but Pandavas said, “We’ll have you.”

00:04:09.417 --> 00:04:15.073
And that is how the war started and,
in the war,

00:04:15.274 --> 00:04:22.861
His greatest disciple was one
of the Pandavas called Arjuna.

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:28.460
And Arjuna asked Him to fight for him.

00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:35.158
He said, “I will not take any weapon
in My hand

00:04:35.343 --> 00:04:41.846
but I will be your charioteer and drive
your chariot.”

00:04:44.215 --> 00:04:52.233
And when He was driving the chariot,
it so happened

00:04:52.434 --> 00:05:05.701
that Krishna saw Arjuna’s depression.

00:05:05.902 --> 00:05:13.449
And Arjuna said, “What is this war?
Why should I fight?

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.855
I’m fighting my own gurus, those who
have taught me

00:05:19.056 --> 00:05:23.674
all the vidyas of the battleship …
(She corrects Herself) … battle,

00:05:23.875 --> 00:05:37.888
and also the vidya of archery and I’m
fighting my own cousins.”

00:05:39.035 --> 00:05:46.955
So Shri Krishna said that, “They are
already killed, they don’t exist,

00:05:47.156 --> 00:05:51.032
they are already dead people,

00:05:51.437 --> 00:05:57.044
because they are not realized souls,
I’ve already killed them.

00:05:57.245 --> 00:06:03.266
So you have to just play this drama
of killing them.”

00:06:06.612 --> 00:06:12.557
So the foremost contradiction that people
present about Gita

00:06:12.758 --> 00:06:19.243
is that those who read Gita should be
vegetarian.

00:06:20.984 --> 00:06:26.916
Krishna told, Shri Krishna told Arjuna
that, “You kill them.”

00:06:27.117 --> 00:06:33.765
Human beings, his own relations, his own
cousins who were bad people.

00:06:33.966 --> 00:06:39.368
What about chickens and goats?

00:06:42.272 --> 00:06:44.813
But all those who start reading Gita
in India

00:06:45.014 --> 00:06:52.715
give up all meat eating and take
to vegetarianism, or they fast.

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:57.289
So how contradictory these things are.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:03.534
So He never preached vegetarianism,
at least in Gita.

00:07:09.047 --> 00:07:13.293
And He asked Arjuna to kill.

00:07:16.854 --> 00:07:26.276
In the modern times there is a war going
on between the evil force and the good.

00:07:26.477 --> 00:07:32.573
You don’t have to kill them; even if you
give them bandhan they are already dead,

00:07:32.774 --> 00:07:37.769
they are not realized souls, they’ll be
all neutralized.

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:43.545
But you have to kill them in the sense you
have to kill your connections with them.

00:07:43.746 --> 00:07:47.536
Like I see many people who come
to Sahaja Yoga,

00:07:47.737 --> 00:07:52.293
“But my mother is not yet a Sahaja
Yogini, so she troubles me,

00:07:52.494 --> 00:07:56.432
how can I do Sahaja Yoga?”

00:07:56.845 --> 00:08:02.049
For anything else they’ll fight the mother
but not for this.

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:08.472
“Kill your attachments and your relations.”

00:08:08.673 --> 00:08:16.395
That’s what He said, if the case they
are troubling you in your ascent.

00:08:16.596 --> 00:08:20.720
This is the message of Gita to begin with.

00:08:21.768 --> 00:08:28.142
But on the contrary, I’ve seen there are
people in Sahaja Yoga

00:08:29.443 --> 00:08:34.168
who once [they] get married want to get
out of Sahaja Yoga,

00:08:34.369 --> 00:08:37.343
take out their husbands or take out
their wives

00:08:37.544 --> 00:08:43.794
or want to live away and want to be
non-collective.

00:08:47.711 --> 00:08:53.507
So you have to kill. There are shad-ripus,
there are six enemies

00:08:53.708 --> 00:09:00.709
human beings have, but in the modern times
they have multiplied, I think.

00:09:04.847 --> 00:09:08.915
The first one is the lust in you.

00:09:10.371 --> 00:09:13.839
Kill your lust.

00:09:16.535 --> 00:09:27.088
The lust that is today finishing the West
more than the greed.

00:09:27.289 --> 00:09:31.135
So first is kill your lust.

00:09:31.336 --> 00:09:35.118
Then kill your anger.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:45.002
There are certain people who have
a built-in response

00:09:45.217 --> 00:09:51.300
that as soon as they see somebody
they get into anger.

00:09:51.895 --> 00:09:54.679
If a white man sees a black man he gets
into an anger,

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.100
a black man sees a white man he gets
into anger, surprising.

00:09:59.301 --> 00:10:03.909
I mean, God has made all kinds of skins;

00:10:04.964 --> 00:10:08.500
the life would be boring if you all have
the same parched skins,

00:10:08.701 --> 00:10:11.662
all of you looking the same.

00:10:11.863 --> 00:10:16.915
So he has made different types
of beautiful people.

00:10:17.352 --> 00:10:22.594
But this anger can come from any source.

00:10:22.795 --> 00:10:25.848
This is what it is when you kill anger,
actually you kill

00:10:26.049 --> 00:10:31.623
all your connections with the past,
the responses,

00:10:31.824 --> 00:10:35.610
the conditionings you have had.

00:10:39.903 --> 00:10:44.890
Then the vanity that people have;

00:10:47.136 --> 00:10:51.770
I find it much more when I go

00:10:51.977 --> 00:10:57.948
to places where people call themselves
bureaucrats

00:10:58.623 --> 00:11:05.212
or they’re “in charge,” like matrons

00:11:05.588 --> 00:11:08.635
telling people what to do, “Do this,
do that, do that.”

00:11:08.836 --> 00:11:15.984
This is the Krishna’s finger, using
Krishna’s finger on others.

00:11:16.388 --> 00:11:23.288
The vanity, the vanity that you are
perfect, you are perfect,

00:11:23.489 --> 00:11:27.280
nothing wrong with you. You are
the best people,

00:11:27.481 --> 00:11:32.760
English think they are the best, Germans
think they are the best,

00:11:32.961 --> 00:11:37.185
Italians think they are the best, or, say,

00:11:37.386 --> 00:11:42.174
the best of all are the Switzerland,
Swiss people

00:11:47.578 --> 00:11:56.478
This vanity, this falsehood, has to be
cut out.

00:11:57.848 --> 00:12:02.279
What have you achieved by being a certain
nation, let us see?

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:10.726
What have you contributed, belonging
to a certain country?

00:12:12.377 --> 00:12:16.398
Those who only belong to the Kingdom
of God have achieved something.

00:12:16.599 --> 00:12:20.740
The rest of them are useless people,
just finding some way

00:12:20.941 --> 00:12:28.887
to fight each other, to denounce others
and vanity is just like a balloon.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:37.103
If somebody just puts a pin into it
the whole thing - balloon will collapse.

00:12:40.741 --> 00:12:43.557
Now the worst of all is jealousy,

00:12:43.758 --> 00:12:48.470
and that is among Indians, Indians are
very big jealous pots.

00:12:48.671 --> 00:12:54.035
Specially the Indians who are again
in the government and the politics,

00:12:54.236 --> 00:12:56.994
but otherwise also there are jealousies.

00:12:57.195 --> 00:13:03.534
They’ll always complain about the other
people and will be jealous.

00:13:04.241 --> 00:13:09.282
And also in the West people are quite
jealous, I must say.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:18.885
They are jealous of things which is most
surprising.

00:13:21.763 --> 00:13:26.482
One day I was going in the car

00:13:26.854 --> 00:13:30.920
and one gentleman was very furious
for nothing at all.

00:13:31.121 --> 00:13:33.824
So the another one tells Me,

00:13:34.025 --> 00:13:38.434
“They are jealous because you are sitting
in a Mercedes car.”

00:13:38.635 --> 00:13:42.352
I said, “But that’s not Mine, that’s My
husband’s, you see.”

00:13:42.553 --> 00:13:46.214
What is there to be jealous because
I’m sitting in a Mercedes car?

00:13:46.415 --> 00:13:50.394
I mean, this is being a very stupid,
nonsensical thing

00:13:50.595 --> 00:13:54.610
but still I can’t believe you can be
jealous of somebody

00:13:54.811 --> 00:14:00.826
because he has a Mercedes car, what does
it matter?

00:14:01.858 --> 00:14:07.586
To Me, it’s a foreign idea absolutely,
I can’t understand.

00:14:07.787 --> 00:14:11.948
But there are stupid and stupid things
like that.

00:14:12.149 --> 00:14:19.584
I can only understand one jealousy, that
is between husband and wife - little bit.

00:14:34.012 --> 00:14:40.052
Then the fifth thing that He asked us
to kill

00:14:42.774 --> 00:14:48.590
is the attachment, very important it is.

00:14:48.791 --> 00:14:53.229
“This is my child, this is my…” This is
Indian also, more Indian,

00:14:53.430 --> 00:15:01.142
“This is my cousin, this is my brother,
this is my fiancé, this is my wife.”

00:15:01.343 --> 00:15:08.681
Also in the West, the other way round is
that they do not care for their children.

00:15:08.882 --> 00:15:12.695
They do not care for their mothers, they
do not care for their fathers.

00:15:12.896 --> 00:15:19.371
They do not care for anyone whatsoever,
but for themselves.

00:15:21.207 --> 00:15:27.067
That comes from the last one, is called
as the greed.

00:15:27.268 --> 00:15:30.105
Because when you have greed,

00:15:30.306 --> 00:15:35.499
you don’t care for anybody, you just want
to have everything,

00:15:36.627 --> 00:15:41.287
from another person. You want to grab
another person of everything.

00:15:41.488 --> 00:15:46.112
Whatever another person has, you want
to have it.

00:15:47.302 --> 00:15:49.810
But when you don’t want to have it
everybody wants to give you,

00:15:50.011 --> 00:15:53.119
that’s My case.

00:15:53.373 --> 00:15:56.427
I’m very afraid to say even that,
“This is nice,”

00:15:56.628 --> 00:16:01.432
because immediately tomorrow I’ll find it
in My house.

00:16:08.161 --> 00:16:13.173
So, this greed is the one which has done
such a harm to the whole world.

00:16:13.374 --> 00:16:19.226
People have gone into great dominations
and, on other countries, for what?

00:16:19.427 --> 00:16:24.518
For these diamonds and nonsensical things
like that, they have ruined

00:16:24.719 --> 00:16:28.871
their own lives, the progenies
of the progenies they have ruined.

00:16:29.072 --> 00:16:33.784
All their cunning they have used to ruin
so many nations,

00:16:33.985 --> 00:16:37.557
just to put them one against another,
creating problems,

00:16:37.758 --> 00:16:41.498
doing all kinds of intrigue.

00:16:41.698 --> 00:16:49.347
Just for what? For greed which is
absolutely like cancer,

00:16:49.548 --> 00:16:57.266
doesn’t allow anybody else to exist. And
then you start eating yourself out.

00:16:57.467 --> 00:17:01.677
It’s a disease, I think, greed.

00:17:02.225 --> 00:17:09.427
And with that goes the miserliness; people
become miserly.

00:17:09.627 --> 00:17:12.055
Then where does this greed end up?

00:17:12.269 --> 00:17:19.217
After all, the money that accumulates or
things that accumulate in your house,

00:17:19.418 --> 00:17:25.798
what happens to them? You want to use them.

00:17:26.388 --> 00:17:31.699
[What’s the matter with this one? No…
Try to be...

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:35.223
not to be... I’ve told you, otherwise,
I’ll ask you to go out, all right?

00:17:35.424 --> 00:17:38.438
Concentrate.]

00:17:39.367 --> 00:17:47.147
So what happens to the people who are
greedy?

00:17:47.348 --> 00:17:51.957
They become miserly, they can’t enjoy life,
they cannot spend money

00:17:52.158 --> 00:17:58.842
because the greatest joy is in giving
things to others, no doubt about it.

00:17:59.043 --> 00:18:01.683
And they cannot give any joy to anyone,

00:18:01.884 --> 00:18:07.518
they cannot create anything for the future
progeny to see.

00:18:07.719 --> 00:18:11.687
So what happens to them? Their children
when they come in,

00:18:11.888 --> 00:18:17.279
they become wasters, waste. They
waste all their money,

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:24.212
they lead a wasteful life, they get into
wrong things, and ruin themselves.

00:18:24.413 --> 00:18:27.952
So their children [who] are born become
miserly.

00:18:28.153 --> 00:18:30.456
So the vicious circle starts moving.

00:18:30.657 --> 00:18:37.377
He has said, “Kill all of them, these are
your six enemies.”

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:49.469
Now the contradiction, again people use,

00:18:52.389 --> 00:19:01.781
about Shri Krishna, in so many other ways
that it is surprising

00:19:01.982 --> 00:19:09.908
that not only Christ, not only Mohammad
Sahib, not only Lao Tze,

00:19:10.305 --> 00:19:17.317
not only Shri Rama but even Krishna was
misused by His followers.

00:19:22.511 --> 00:19:26.866
He’s the one who is Tatastha, the one…,

00:19:27.067 --> 00:19:32.797
Tatastha means who stands on the banks
of the attention and sees everything,

00:19:32.998 --> 00:19:38.609
who watches everything, He is the one
who is the witness.

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:47.840
He described, “Sakshi rupena samsthita,”
He becomes a sakshi, a witness.

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:53.950
That’s what He has said, it’s a play,
it’s a play.

00:19:54.719 --> 00:20:00.804
But in the name of Krishna you'll find
all kinds of absurd things people do.

00:20:01.005 --> 00:20:05.620
They make dramas, they become Krishnas,
they become carry flutes,

00:20:05.821 --> 00:20:09.317
they make people…, befool them,
make money out of it

00:20:09.518 --> 00:20:12.023
or they sell books on the street.

00:20:12.224 --> 00:20:16.094
Like if you go to Southall you’ll find
so many Westerners

00:20:16.309 --> 00:20:20.125
wearing funny dresses, going round,
asking for alms from Indians

00:20:20.326 --> 00:20:22.686
and Indians say, “Oh look at that, these
beggars,

00:20:22.887 --> 00:20:28.503
you see, they have come to get some,
let us give them some money.”

00:20:33.459 --> 00:20:40.533
So, the contradiction of Krishna’s life
is such a miserable thing,

00:20:40.734 --> 00:20:49.134
is such a absurd thing that it hurts Me

00:20:49.335 --> 00:20:57.851
to see how such a great incarnation was
misused in this world by human beings.

00:20:58.637 --> 00:21:02.509
If there was anything lacking in that
incarnation, was this,

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:08.455
that He did not give Realization
to people - but He did talk about it.

00:21:08.656 --> 00:21:12.368
He said about it, talked of meditation;

00:21:12.569 --> 00:21:18.841
He did all that was needed to put
the stage.

00:21:21.043 --> 00:21:27.831
But what is the result? All His incarnation
was misused.

00:21:28.032 --> 00:21:31.308
Throughout Gita if you read,

00:21:31.509 --> 00:21:38.367
you’ll be amazed how people have changed
Gita and its writings also.

00:21:38.568 --> 00:21:42.593
Same in the Bible and same in the Koran.

00:21:42.794 --> 00:21:48.579
Things that they could never have said it.
How could they have said it?

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:54.870
Is a surprise, impossible, because they
cannot contradict themselves.

00:21:55.071 --> 00:21:58.257
For example,

00:22:00.542 --> 00:22:08.398
Gita is written by Vyasa who was
an illegitimate child of a fisherwoman.

00:22:08.599 --> 00:22:12.307
But in the Gita it is written that your
caste is determined by your birth;

00:22:12.508 --> 00:22:15.711
how can it be?

00:22:17.603 --> 00:22:23.323
A one who is a son of…, an illegitimate son
of a fisherwoman,

00:22:23.524 --> 00:22:27.915
how can he say like that? See
the contradiction.

00:22:31.089 --> 00:22:35.058
Same in the Bible, same in the Torah,
same in the Koran,

00:22:35.259 --> 00:22:39.255
in all these books, all these people have
tried to play

00:22:39.456 --> 00:22:46.199
a very nasty role by changing them.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.911
But you can find it out.

00:22:49.112 --> 00:22:53.451
Luckily, whatever they may try, the truth
comes out in this manner

00:22:53.665 --> 00:22:58.747
and you can prove it that “whatever you are
saying is wrong, cannot be”.

00:22:58.948 --> 00:23:02.986
The one Vyasa who wrote was the son
of a fisherwoman

00:23:03.187 --> 00:23:08.003
and how can he say that Brahmins are the
highest, when he’s not born as a Brahmin

00:23:08.204 --> 00:23:12.579
and to say that your caste Brahminism
comes from your birth?

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:16.760
From your rebirth!

00:23:18.915 --> 00:23:23.417
Only they removed little bit – rebirth.

00:23:31.896 --> 00:23:35.772
This is how they interpreted Gita
in various ways,

00:23:35.973 --> 00:23:39.887
in such contradictory manners.

00:23:40.752 --> 00:23:46.404
His whole writings or sayings

00:23:46.605 --> 00:23:49.579
could not be changed, of course, they
could not change it.

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:55.659
but wherever they wanted to put their
own style, they did it.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:59.832
Because ultimately it went into the hands
of the Brahmins

00:24:00.033 --> 00:24:03.865
who were not really Brahmins, they were
the people who were shudras

00:24:04.066 --> 00:24:07.821
because they were not even realized souls
and behaving in such a dirty manner;

00:24:08.022 --> 00:24:09.958
they should not be called as Brahmins.

00:24:10.159 --> 00:24:16.592
But it went into the hands of so-called
Brahmins and they misinterpreted it.

00:24:18.013 --> 00:24:26.103
Same thing with Bible. It went into
the hands of horrid people.

00:24:26.325 --> 00:24:31.310
Mr. John said something which was
sensible, all right,

00:24:31.524 --> 00:24:41.032
but what about the other fellow, Paul?
He comes in and spoils everything.

00:24:42.747 --> 00:24:49.689
Then comes Augustine, he spoils everything,
why? Because they are devils.

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:53.832
There is a evil force;

00:24:54.033 --> 00:24:58.795
this theory that there is no evil force is
a wrong theory, doesn’t exist.

00:24:58.996 --> 00:25:07.377
There is a evil force; and don’t play into
the hands of evil force even this much.

00:25:10.897 --> 00:25:16.995
And that was clearly told by Shri Krishna.

00:25:20.731 --> 00:25:25.583
But even there the contradictions can
come in.

00:25:28.094 --> 00:25:36.938
Like if you are a Krishna bhakta

00:25:38.454 --> 00:25:42.143
then if you just start running
on the street,

00:25:42.344 --> 00:25:49.862
“Krishna! Krishna! Krishna! Krishna!”,
like that, then you are a-celebrating,

00:25:51.608 --> 00:25:58.459
or like a madcap go on, “Krishna! Krishna!
Krishna!”, like that.

00:26:02.886 --> 00:26:14.493
Or else, going worse than that, is some
people say, “We are Krishnas”.

00:26:14.811 --> 00:26:18.520
Like this horrible Rajneesh did.
And he said,

00:26:18.721 --> 00:26:22.808
“He used to make the women naked,
so I’m making the women naked.”

00:26:23.009 --> 00:26:27.187
I started wondering, “When did Krishna
make women naked?”

00:26:27.388 --> 00:26:31.708
When He was a little boy less than five
years of age,

00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:34.575
He used to climb upon the trees

00:26:34.801 --> 00:26:40.988
and the ladies used to take their bath
in the river Yamuna.

00:26:41.885 --> 00:26:46.751
So, He used to hide their clothes just to
raise their Kundalini and see how it works.

00:26:46.965 --> 00:26:51.926
At the age of five years what does
a child understand?

00:26:52.127 --> 00:26:57.911
This horrible fellow, was he five years
of age when he was doing this nonsense?

00:26:59.713 --> 00:27:03.815
Using Shri Krishna’s name like this?

00:27:05.667 --> 00:27:13.344
And when He used to break the pitchers
of these gopis,

00:27:13.545 --> 00:27:18.063
what was He doing? He was doing Kundalini
awakening,

00:27:18.264 --> 00:27:22.730
because the gopis were taking out the water
from the river Yamuna

00:27:22.931 --> 00:27:27.625
which was vibrated by Radha and He used
to break them on the back

00:27:27.826 --> 00:27:30.425
so that the water would fall on their
Kundalini

00:27:30.626 --> 00:27:35.515
and they would get their Realization,
in this lifetime.

00:27:38.646 --> 00:27:43.419
That’s what’s His purification.

00:27:44.785 --> 00:27:48.524
But first thing they will do is to separate
Shri Krishna as a child

00:27:48.725 --> 00:27:55.161
and Shri Krishna as the one who talks
to Arjuna, very nice.

00:27:55.362 --> 00:28:01.749
So there is no relevance and use Him
the way you want to.

00:28:03.289 --> 00:28:10.946
It’s a very common thing that people start
talking about Shri Krishna

00:28:11.147 --> 00:28:19.267
as if He’s in their pocket, or they are
the writers of Gita.

00:28:20.196 --> 00:28:23.925
Like we have in the churches those bishops
and things who drink a lot

00:28:24.126 --> 00:28:30.049
and then they take out their Bible and
start reading upside down.

00:28:35.597 --> 00:28:38.783
All this priest class, whether this belongs
to this or to that,

00:28:38.984 --> 00:28:47.910
all of them are hypocrites of the worst
type, just money-spinning people.

00:28:48.997 --> 00:28:54.748
Even Indian temples which are not
far-fetched are ruined.

00:28:54.949 --> 00:28:59.730
All the ganja and all that is sold
in Indian temples.

00:29:03.922 --> 00:29:12.176
All these popes and all these people are
doing something that is never expected.

00:29:12.377 --> 00:29:20.008
Imagine, they make a kind of a wine called
Benedictine in your Vatican.

00:29:20.209 --> 00:29:24.164
Can you imagine such a nonsensical thing
like that?

00:29:24.365 --> 00:29:28.585
Tomorrow they’ll open a beer bar,

00:29:32.037 --> 00:29:35.240
I wouldn’t be surprised.

00:29:35.441 --> 00:29:38.708
So, we come to a position to understand
that all those people

00:29:39.216 --> 00:29:46.365
who talk of these great incarnations and
profess a religion

00:29:46.589 --> 00:29:52.848
are all hypocrites. There’s no religion
there.

00:29:54.912 --> 00:30:02.038
Simple people who believe these hypocrites
because they’re so simple, so innocent.

00:30:02.239 --> 00:30:12.266
These cunning, greedy devils

00:30:12.467 --> 00:30:18.063
who started these religions, exploited
these simple people,

00:30:18.264 --> 00:30:23.349
used them for making temples, churches,
mosques,

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:28.176
they have no religion within them, how
can they talk of God?

00:30:28.377 --> 00:30:32.119
Their life is so impure!

00:30:33.917 --> 00:30:39.970
So, we had to start our own innate
religion,

00:30:41.152 --> 00:30:50.737
our own spontaneous, natural religion,
which is the human religion,

00:30:50.938 --> 00:30:56.671
which is the Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

00:30:56.872 --> 00:31:02.152
The one that will give you the inner
ascent,

00:31:02.353 --> 00:31:09.655
not just talk, no hypocrisy; and all that

00:31:11.306 --> 00:31:18.736
which goes with religion to malign
the names of these great incarnations

00:31:18.937 --> 00:31:24.354
has to be brought to the light for
the people to see this nonsense

00:31:24.555 --> 00:31:29.320
that has been eating into our societies,
eating into our families,

00:31:29.521 --> 00:31:34.095
eating into our children, has to go away.

00:31:40.194 --> 00:31:44.893
“Yada yada hi dharmasya” - whenever
the religion –

00:31:45.094 --> 00:31:50.620
dharma doesn’t mean this nonsensical
religion – falls down,

00:31:55.783 --> 00:32:06.511
that time, “Paritranaya sadhunam”, to save
the sadhus, the seekers,

00:32:07.841 --> 00:32:12.881
“Paritranaya sadhunam - Vinashayacha
dushkrutam”,

00:32:13.082 --> 00:32:21.390
and to destroy all these devils, “I take
My birth again and again,” -

00:32:21.591 --> 00:32:29.727
“Sambhavami yuge yuge”: “Every yuga
I take My birth.”

00:32:32.484 --> 00:32:37.138
And this is what is an incarnation.

00:32:37.875 --> 00:32:41.804
You must be very fortunate people

00:32:42.005 --> 00:32:49.295
that now you can see the cunning
of all these devils

00:32:49.914 --> 00:32:57.587
and can exist into that purity,
into that benevolence,

00:32:57.788 --> 00:33:04.001
the hita, which was promised
by Shri Krishna.

00:33:06.347 --> 00:33:15.148
He never told lies, what He told was
the truth. He was truth.

00:33:19.226 --> 00:33:23.956
But those who tried to use Him had to take
course to something

00:33:24.157 --> 00:33:29.241
which was falsehood, hypocrisy and cunning

00:33:29.442 --> 00:33:39.435
but that in no way should stop the truthful
people from getting to reality.

00:33:39.636 --> 00:33:42.821
May God bless you all.

00:33:45.224 --> 00:33:47.939
Some water please.

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:11.607
Now, we should have some music after this.

00:34:12.968 --> 00:34:16.215
It was too powerful ...

00:35:03.593 --> 00:35:07.339
My fan was just here somewhere.

00:35:12.794 --> 00:35:18.794
It's here. You can take this now.

00:35:18.995 --> 00:35:22.490
I mean, if you need there.

00:39:51.381 --> 00:39:56.271
Hello, how are you? All right?

00:44:00.238 --> 00:44:06.512
Beautiful. Well done.

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:19.158
Spain is progressing fast.
