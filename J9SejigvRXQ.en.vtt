WEBVTT

01:43.743 --> 01:48.984
So we have decided… [A little further,

01:50.979 --> 01:55.124
should be brought little further
(the microphone)],

02:03.689 --> 02:10.625
we have decided to have the puja after
our dinner

02:10.872 --> 02:16.304
because Shri Krishna was born in the night,
about twelve o’clock,

02:16.505 --> 02:24.876
while I was born twelve o’clock in
the daytime, same with Shri Rama.

02:25.077 --> 02:32.577
And also Christ was born twelve o’clock
in the night.

02:42.894 --> 02:49.635
I’ve told you that today I’m going to tell
you about Gita.

02:52.058 --> 02:59.762
That is the second part of Krishna’s life.
It’s so different and varied

02:59.963 --> 03:03.921
that some people, intellectuals as usual,

03:04.122 --> 03:08.629
say that the Krishna who played as a child
in Gokul

03:08.830 --> 03:16.107
was different from the Krishna who was
the king of Dwarika.

03:20.278 --> 03:25.490
So when He became the king of Dwarika,

03:28.077 --> 03:33.046
there was a war between Pandava and
Kauravas,

03:33.252 --> 03:39.283
one representing the good people, another
representing the bad people.

03:42.007 --> 03:51.031
So they came to ask Him if He would join
on their side.

03:51.232 --> 03:57.097
So He said, “I’ve got My army and I’m
Myself,

03:57.298 --> 04:02.122
so whichever you choose you can have.”

04:02.323 --> 04:05.248
So Kauravas said, “We’ll have your army,”

04:05.449 --> 04:09.216
but Pandavas said, “We’ll have you.”

04:09.417 --> 04:15.073
And that is how the war started and,
in the war,

04:15.274 --> 04:22.861
His greatest disciple was one
of the Pandavas called Arjuna.

04:23.099 --> 04:28.460
And Arjuna asked Him to fight for him.

04:28.661 --> 04:35.158
He said, “I will not take any weapon
in My hand

04:35.343 --> 04:41.846
but I will be your charioteer and drive
your chariot.”

04:44.215 --> 04:52.233
And when He was driving the chariot,
it so happened

04:52.434 --> 05:05.701
that Krishna saw Arjuna’s depression.

05:05.902 --> 05:13.449
And Arjuna said, “What is this war?
Why should I fight?

05:13.650 --> 05:18.855
I’m fighting my own gurus, those who
have taught me

05:19.056 --> 05:23.674
all the vidyas of the battleship …
(She corrects Herself) … battle,

05:23.875 --> 05:37.888
and also the vidya of archery and I’m
fighting my own cousins.”

05:39.035 --> 05:46.955
So Shri Krishna said that, “They are
already killed, they don’t exist,

05:47.156 --> 05:51.032
they are already dead people,

05:51.437 --> 05:57.044
because they are not realized souls,
I’ve already killed them.

05:57.245 --> 06:03.266
So you have to just play this drama
of killing them.”

06:06.612 --> 06:12.557
So the foremost contradiction that people
present about Gita

06:12.758 --> 06:19.243
is that those who read Gita should be
vegetarian.

06:20.984 --> 06:26.916
Krishna told, Shri Krishna told Arjuna
that, “You kill them.”

06:27.117 --> 06:33.765
Human beings, his own relations, his own
cousins who were bad people.

06:33.966 --> 06:39.368
What about chickens and goats?

06:42.272 --> 06:44.813
But all those who start reading Gita
in India

06:45.014 --> 06:52.715
give up all meat eating and take
to vegetarianism, or they fast.

06:53.469 --> 06:57.289
So how contradictory these things are.

06:57.490 --> 07:03.534
So He never preached vegetarianism,
at least in Gita.

07:09.047 --> 07:13.293
And He asked Arjuna to kill.

07:16.854 --> 07:26.276
In the modern times there is a war going
on between the evil force and the good.

07:26.477 --> 07:32.573
You don’t have to kill them; even if you
give them bandhan they are already dead,

07:32.774 --> 07:37.769
they are not realized souls, they’ll be
all neutralized.

07:37.970 --> 07:43.545
But you have to kill them in the sense you
have to kill your connections with them.

07:43.746 --> 07:47.536
Like I see many people who come
to Sahaja Yoga,

07:47.737 --> 07:52.293
“But my mother is not yet a Sahaja
Yogini, so she troubles me,

07:52.494 --> 07:56.432
how can I do Sahaja Yoga?”

07:56.845 --> 08:02.049
For anything else they’ll fight the mother
but not for this.

08:02.732 --> 08:08.472
“Kill your attachments and your relations.”

08:08.673 --> 08:16.395
That’s what He said, if the case they
are troubling you in your ascent.

08:16.596 --> 08:20.720
This is the message of Gita to begin with.

08:21.768 --> 08:28.142
But on the contrary, I’ve seen there are
people in Sahaja Yoga

08:29.443 --> 08:34.168
who once [they] get married want to get
out of Sahaja Yoga,

08:34.369 --> 08:37.343
take out their husbands or take out
their wives

08:37.544 --> 08:43.794
or want to live away and want to be
non-collective.

08:47.711 --> 08:53.507
So you have to kill. There are shad-ripus,
there are six enemies

08:53.708 --> 09:00.709
human beings have, but in the modern times
they have multiplied, I think.

09:04.847 --> 09:08.915
The first one is the lust in you.

09:10.371 --> 09:13.839
Kill your lust.

09:16.535 --> 09:27.088
The lust that is today finishing the West
more than the greed.

09:27.289 --> 09:31.135
So first is kill your lust.

09:31.336 --> 09:35.118
Then kill your anger.

09:39.670 --> 09:45.002
There are certain people who have
a built-in response

09:45.217 --> 09:51.300
that as soon as they see somebody
they get into anger.

09:51.895 --> 09:54.679
If a white man sees a black man he gets
into an anger,

09:54.880 --> 09:59.100
a black man sees a white man he gets
into anger, surprising.

09:59.301 --> 10:03.909
I mean, God has made all kinds of skins;

10:04.964 --> 10:08.500
the life would be boring if you all have
the same parched skins,

10:08.701 --> 10:11.662
all of you looking the same.

10:11.863 --> 10:16.915
So he has made different types
of beautiful people.

10:17.352 --> 10:22.594
But this anger can come from any source.

10:22.795 --> 10:25.848
This is what it is when you kill anger,
actually you kill

10:26.049 --> 10:31.623
all your connections with the past,
the responses,

10:31.824 --> 10:35.610
the conditionings you have had.

10:39.903 --> 10:44.890
Then the vanity that people have;

10:47.136 --> 10:51.770
I find it much more when I go

10:51.977 --> 10:57.948
to places where people call themselves
bureaucrats

10:58.623 --> 11:05.212
or they’re “in charge,” like matrons

11:05.588 --> 11:08.635
telling people what to do, “Do this,
do that, do that.”

11:08.836 --> 11:15.984
This is the Krishna’s finger, using
Krishna’s finger on others.

11:16.388 --> 11:23.288
The vanity, the vanity that you are
perfect, you are perfect,

11:23.489 --> 11:27.280
nothing wrong with you. You are
the best people,

11:27.481 --> 11:32.760
English think they are the best, Germans
think they are the best,

11:32.961 --> 11:37.185
Italians think they are the best, or, say,

11:37.386 --> 11:42.174
the best of all are the Switzerland,
Swiss people

11:47.578 --> 11:56.478
This vanity, this falsehood, has to be
cut out.

11:57.848 --> 12:02.279
What have you achieved by being a certain
nation, let us see?

12:02.480 --> 12:10.726
What have you contributed, belonging
to a certain country?

12:12.377 --> 12:16.398
Those who only belong to the Kingdom
of God have achieved something.

12:16.599 --> 12:20.740
The rest of them are useless people,
just finding some way

12:20.941 --> 12:28.887
to fight each other, to denounce others
and vanity is just like a balloon.

12:30.260 --> 12:37.103
If somebody just puts a pin into it
the whole thing - balloon will collapse.

12:40.741 --> 12:43.557
Now the worst of all is jealousy,

12:43.758 --> 12:48.470
and that is among Indians, Indians are
very big jealous pots.

12:48.671 --> 12:54.035
Specially the Indians who are again
in the government and the politics,

12:54.236 --> 12:56.994
but otherwise also there are jealousies.

12:57.195 --> 13:03.534
They’ll always complain about the other
people and will be jealous.

13:04.241 --> 13:09.282
And also in the West people are quite
jealous, I must say.

13:09.490 --> 13:18.885
They are jealous of things which is most
surprising.

13:21.763 --> 13:26.482
One day I was going in the car

13:26.854 --> 13:30.920
and one gentleman was very furious
for nothing at all.

13:31.121 --> 13:33.824
So the another one tells Me,

13:34.025 --> 13:38.434
“They are jealous because you are sitting
in a Mercedes car.”

13:38.635 --> 13:42.352
I said, “But that’s not Mine, that’s My
husband’s, you see.”

13:42.553 --> 13:46.214
What is there to be jealous because
I’m sitting in a Mercedes car?

13:46.415 --> 13:50.394
I mean, this is being a very stupid,
nonsensical thing

13:50.595 --> 13:54.610
but still I can’t believe you can be
jealous of somebody

13:54.811 --> 14:00.826
because he has a Mercedes car, what does
it matter?

14:01.858 --> 14:07.586
To Me, it’s a foreign idea absolutely,
I can’t understand.

14:07.787 --> 14:11.948
But there are stupid and stupid things
like that.

14:12.149 --> 14:19.584
I can only understand one jealousy, that
is between husband and wife - little bit.

14:34.012 --> 14:40.052
Then the fifth thing that He asked us
to kill

14:42.774 --> 14:48.590
is the attachment, very important it is.

14:48.791 --> 14:53.229
“This is my child, this is my…” This is
Indian also, more Indian,

14:53.430 --> 15:01.142
“This is my cousin, this is my brother,
this is my fiancé, this is my wife.”

15:01.343 --> 15:08.681
Also in the West, the other way round is
that they do not care for their children.

15:08.882 --> 15:12.695
They do not care for their mothers, they
do not care for their fathers.

15:12.896 --> 15:19.371
They do not care for anyone whatsoever,
but for themselves.

15:21.207 --> 15:27.067
That comes from the last one, is called
as the greed.

15:27.268 --> 15:30.105
Because when you have greed,

15:30.306 --> 15:35.499
you don’t care for anybody, you just want
to have everything,

15:36.627 --> 15:41.287
from another person. You want to grab
another person of everything.

15:41.488 --> 15:46.112
Whatever another person has, you want
to have it.

15:47.302 --> 15:49.810
But when you don’t want to have it
everybody wants to give you,

15:50.011 --> 15:53.119
that’s My case.

15:53.373 --> 15:56.427
I’m very afraid to say even that,
“This is nice,”

15:56.628 --> 16:01.432
because immediately tomorrow I’ll find it
in My house.

16:08.161 --> 16:13.173
So, this greed is the one which has done
such a harm to the whole world.

16:13.374 --> 16:19.226
People have gone into great dominations
and, on other countries, for what?

16:19.427 --> 16:24.518
For these diamonds and nonsensical things
like that, they have ruined

16:24.719 --> 16:28.871
their own lives, the progenies
of the progenies they have ruined.

16:29.072 --> 16:33.784
All their cunning they have used to ruin
so many nations,

16:33.985 --> 16:37.557
just to put them one against another,
creating problems,

16:37.758 --> 16:41.498
doing all kinds of intrigue.

16:41.698 --> 16:49.347
Just for what? For greed which is
absolutely like cancer,

16:49.548 --> 16:57.266
doesn’t allow anybody else to exist. And
then you start eating yourself out.

16:57.467 --> 17:01.677
It’s a disease, I think, greed.

17:02.225 --> 17:09.427
And with that goes the miserliness; people
become miserly.

17:09.627 --> 17:12.055
Then where does this greed end up?

17:12.269 --> 17:19.217
After all, the money that accumulates or
things that accumulate in your house,

17:19.418 --> 17:25.798
what happens to them? You want to use them.

17:26.388 --> 17:31.699
[What’s the matter with this one? No…
Try to be...

17:31.900 --> 17:35.223
not to be... I’ve told you, otherwise,
I’ll ask you to go out, all right?

17:35.424 --> 17:38.438
Concentrate.]

17:39.367 --> 17:47.147
So what happens to the people who are
greedy?

17:47.348 --> 17:51.957
They become miserly, they can’t enjoy life,
they cannot spend money

17:52.158 --> 17:58.842
because the greatest joy is in giving
things to others, no doubt about it.

17:59.043 --> 18:01.683
And they cannot give any joy to anyone,

18:01.884 --> 18:07.518
they cannot create anything for the future
progeny to see.

18:07.719 --> 18:11.687
So what happens to them? Their children
when they come in,

18:11.888 --> 18:17.279
they become wasters, waste. They
waste all their money,

18:17.480 --> 18:24.212
they lead a wasteful life, they get into
wrong things, and ruin themselves.

18:24.413 --> 18:27.952
So their children [who] are born become
miserly.

18:28.153 --> 18:30.456
So the vicious circle starts moving.

18:30.657 --> 18:37.377
He has said, “Kill all of them, these are
your six enemies.”

18:43.210 --> 18:49.469
Now the contradiction, again people use,

18:52.389 --> 19:01.781
about Shri Krishna, in so many other ways
that it is surprising

19:01.982 --> 19:09.908
that not only Christ, not only Mohammad
Sahib, not only Lao Tze,

19:10.305 --> 19:17.317
not only Shri Rama but even Krishna was
misused by His followers.

19:22.511 --> 19:26.866
He’s the one who is Tatastha, the one…,

19:27.067 --> 19:32.797
Tatastha means who stands on the banks
of the attention and sees everything,

19:32.998 --> 19:38.609
who watches everything, He is the one
who is the witness.

19:39.450 --> 19:47.840
He described, “Sakshi rupena samsthita,”
He becomes a sakshi, a witness.

19:48.690 --> 19:53.950
That’s what He has said, it’s a play,
it’s a play.

19:54.719 --> 20:00.804
But in the name of Krishna you'll find
all kinds of absurd things people do.

20:01.005 --> 20:05.620
They make dramas, they become Krishnas,
they become carry flutes,

20:05.821 --> 20:09.317
they make people…, befool them,
make money out of it

20:09.518 --> 20:12.023
or they sell books on the street.

20:12.224 --> 20:16.094
Like if you go to Southall you’ll find
so many Westerners

20:16.309 --> 20:20.125
wearing funny dresses, going round,
asking for alms from Indians

20:20.326 --> 20:22.686
and Indians say, “Oh look at that, these
beggars,

20:22.887 --> 20:28.503
you see, they have come to get some,
let us give them some money.”

20:33.459 --> 20:40.533
So, the contradiction of Krishna’s life
is such a miserable thing,

20:40.734 --> 20:49.134
is such a absurd thing that it hurts Me

20:49.335 --> 20:57.851
to see how such a great incarnation was
misused in this world by human beings.

20:58.637 --> 21:02.509
If there was anything lacking in that
incarnation, was this,

21:02.710 --> 21:08.455
that He did not give Realization
to people - but He did talk about it.

21:08.656 --> 21:12.368
He said about it, talked of meditation;

21:12.569 --> 21:18.841
He did all that was needed to put
the stage.

21:21.043 --> 21:27.831
But what is the result? All His incarnation
was misused.

21:28.032 --> 21:31.308
Throughout Gita if you read,

21:31.509 --> 21:38.367
you’ll be amazed how people have changed
Gita and its writings also.

21:38.568 --> 21:42.593
Same in the Bible and same in the Koran.

21:42.794 --> 21:48.579
Things that they could never have said it.
How could they have said it?

21:48.780 --> 21:54.870
Is a surprise, impossible, because they
cannot contradict themselves.

21:55.071 --> 21:58.257
For example,

22:00.542 --> 22:08.398
Gita is written by Vyasa who was
an illegitimate child of a fisherwoman.

22:08.599 --> 22:12.307
But in the Gita it is written that your
caste is determined by your birth;

22:12.508 --> 22:15.711
how can it be?

22:17.603 --> 22:23.323
A one who is a son of…, an illegitimate son
of a fisherwoman,

22:23.524 --> 22:27.915
how can he say like that? See
the contradiction.

22:31.089 --> 22:35.058
Same in the Bible, same in the Torah,
same in the Koran,

22:35.259 --> 22:39.255
in all these books, all these people have
tried to play

22:39.456 --> 22:46.199
a very nasty role by changing them.

22:46.400 --> 22:48.911
But you can find it out.

22:49.112 --> 22:53.451
Luckily, whatever they may try, the truth
comes out in this manner

22:53.665 --> 22:58.747
and you can prove it that “whatever you are
saying is wrong, cannot be”.

22:58.948 --> 23:02.986
The one Vyasa who wrote was the son
of a fisherwoman

23:03.187 --> 23:08.003
and how can he say that Brahmins are the
highest, when he’s not born as a Brahmin

23:08.204 --> 23:12.579
and to say that your caste Brahminism
comes from your birth?

23:12.780 --> 23:16.760
From your rebirth!

23:18.915 --> 23:23.417
Only they removed little bit – rebirth.

23:31.896 --> 23:35.772
This is how they interpreted Gita
in various ways,

23:35.973 --> 23:39.887
in such contradictory manners.

23:40.752 --> 23:46.404
His whole writings or sayings

23:46.605 --> 23:49.579
could not be changed, of course, they
could not change it.

23:49.780 --> 23:55.659
but wherever they wanted to put their
own style, they did it.

23:55.860 --> 23:59.832
Because ultimately it went into the hands
of the Brahmins

24:00.033 --> 24:03.865
who were not really Brahmins, they were
the people who were shudras

24:04.066 --> 24:07.821
because they were not even realized souls
and behaving in such a dirty manner;

24:08.022 --> 24:09.958
they should not be called as Brahmins.

24:10.159 --> 24:16.592
But it went into the hands of so-called
Brahmins and they misinterpreted it.

24:18.013 --> 24:26.103
Same thing with Bible. It went into
the hands of horrid people.

24:26.325 --> 24:31.310
Mr. John said something which was
sensible, all right,

24:31.524 --> 24:41.032
but what about the other fellow, Paul?
He comes in and spoils everything.

24:42.747 --> 24:49.689
Then comes Augustine, he spoils everything,
why? Because they are devils.

24:49.890 --> 24:53.832
There is a evil force;

24:54.033 --> 24:58.795
this theory that there is no evil force is
a wrong theory, doesn’t exist.

24:58.996 --> 25:07.377
There is a evil force; and don’t play into
the hands of evil force even this much.

25:10.897 --> 25:16.995
And that was clearly told by Shri Krishna.

25:20.731 --> 25:25.583
But even there the contradictions can
come in.

25:28.094 --> 25:36.938
Like if you are a Krishna bhakta

25:38.454 --> 25:42.143
then if you just start running
on the street,

25:42.344 --> 25:49.862
“Krishna! Krishna! Krishna! Krishna!”,
like that, then you are a-celebrating,

25:51.608 --> 25:58.459
or like a madcap go on, “Krishna! Krishna!
Krishna!”, like that.

26:02.886 --> 26:14.493
Or else, going worse than that, is some
people say, “We are Krishnas”.

26:14.811 --> 26:18.520
Like this horrible Rajneesh did.
And he said,

26:18.721 --> 26:22.808
“He used to make the women naked,
so I’m making the women naked.”

26:23.009 --> 26:27.187
I started wondering, “When did Krishna
make women naked?”

26:27.388 --> 26:31.708
When He was a little boy less than five
years of age,

26:31.909 --> 26:34.575
He used to climb upon the trees

26:34.801 --> 26:40.988
and the ladies used to take their bath
in the river Yamuna.

26:41.885 --> 26:46.751
So, He used to hide their clothes just to
raise their Kundalini and see how it works.

26:46.965 --> 26:51.926
At the age of five years what does
a child understand?

26:52.127 --> 26:57.911
This horrible fellow, was he five years
of age when he was doing this nonsense?

26:59.713 --> 27:03.815
Using Shri Krishna’s name like this?

27:05.667 --> 27:13.344
And when He used to break the pitchers
of these gopis,

27:13.545 --> 27:18.063
what was He doing? He was doing Kundalini
awakening,

27:18.264 --> 27:22.730
because the gopis were taking out the water
from the river Yamuna

27:22.931 --> 27:27.625
which was vibrated by Radha and He used
to break them on the back

27:27.826 --> 27:30.425
so that the water would fall on their
Kundalini

27:30.626 --> 27:35.515
and they would get their Realization,
in this lifetime.

27:38.646 --> 27:43.419
That’s what’s His purification.

27:44.785 --> 27:48.524
But first thing they will do is to separate
Shri Krishna as a child

27:48.725 --> 27:55.161
and Shri Krishna as the one who talks
to Arjuna, very nice.

27:55.362 --> 28:01.749
So there is no relevance and use Him
the way you want to.

28:03.289 --> 28:10.946
It’s a very common thing that people start
talking about Shri Krishna

28:11.147 --> 28:19.267
as if He’s in their pocket, or they are
the writers of Gita.

28:20.196 --> 28:23.925
Like we have in the churches those bishops
and things who drink a lot

28:24.126 --> 28:30.049
and then they take out their Bible and
start reading upside down.

28:35.597 --> 28:38.783
All this priest class, whether this belongs
to this or to that,

28:38.984 --> 28:47.910
all of them are hypocrites of the worst
type, just money-spinning people.

28:48.997 --> 28:54.748
Even Indian temples which are not
far-fetched are ruined.

28:54.949 --> 28:59.730
All the ganja and all that is sold
in Indian temples.

29:03.922 --> 29:12.176
All these popes and all these people are
doing something that is never expected.

29:12.377 --> 29:20.008
Imagine, they make a kind of a wine called
Benedictine in your Vatican.

29:20.209 --> 29:24.164
Can you imagine such a nonsensical thing
like that?

29:24.365 --> 29:28.585
Tomorrow they’ll open a beer bar,

29:32.037 --> 29:35.240
I wouldn’t be surprised.

29:35.441 --> 29:38.708
So, we come to a position to understand
that all those people

29:39.216 --> 29:46.365
who talk of these great incarnations and
profess a religion

29:46.589 --> 29:52.848
are all hypocrites. There’s no religion
there.

29:54.912 --> 30:02.038
Simple people who believe these hypocrites
because they’re so simple, so innocent.

30:02.239 --> 30:12.266
These cunning, greedy devils

30:12.467 --> 30:18.063
who started these religions, exploited
these simple people,

30:18.264 --> 30:23.349
used them for making temples, churches,
mosques,

30:23.550 --> 30:28.176
they have no religion within them, how
can they talk of God?

30:28.377 --> 30:32.119
Their life is so impure!

30:33.917 --> 30:39.970
So, we had to start our own innate
religion,

30:41.152 --> 30:50.737
our own spontaneous, natural religion,
which is the human religion,

30:50.938 --> 30:56.671
which is the Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

30:56.872 --> 31:02.152
The one that will give you the inner
ascent,

31:02.353 --> 31:09.655
not just talk, no hypocrisy; and all that

31:11.306 --> 31:18.736
which goes with religion to malign
the names of these great incarnations

31:18.937 --> 31:24.354
has to be brought to the light for
the people to see this nonsense

31:24.555 --> 31:29.320
that has been eating into our societies,
eating into our families,

31:29.521 --> 31:34.095
eating into our children, has to go away.

31:40.194 --> 31:44.893
“Yada yada hi dharmasya” - whenever
the religion –

31:45.094 --> 31:50.620
dharma doesn’t mean this nonsensical
religion – falls down,

31:55.783 --> 32:06.511
that time, “Paritranaya sadhunam”, to save
the sadhus, the seekers,

32:07.841 --> 32:12.881
“Paritranaya sadhunam - Vinashayacha
dushkrutam”,

32:13.082 --> 32:21.390
and to destroy all these devils, “I take
My birth again and again,” -

32:21.591 --> 32:29.727
“Sambhavami yuge yuge”: “Every yuga
I take My birth.”

32:32.484 --> 32:37.138
And this is what is an incarnation.

32:37.875 --> 32:41.804
You must be very fortunate people

32:42.005 --> 32:49.295
that now you can see the cunning
of all these devils

32:49.914 --> 32:57.587
and can exist into that purity,
into that benevolence,

32:57.788 --> 33:04.001
the hita, which was promised
by Shri Krishna.

33:06.347 --> 33:15.148
He never told lies, what He told was
the truth. He was truth.

33:19.226 --> 33:23.956
But those who tried to use Him had to take
course to something

33:24.157 --> 33:29.241
which was falsehood, hypocrisy and cunning

33:29.442 --> 33:39.435
but that in no way should stop the truthful
people from getting to reality.

33:39.636 --> 33:42.821
May God bless you all.

33:45.224 --> 33:47.939
Some water please.

34:05.810 --> 34:11.607
Now, we should have some music after this.

34:12.968 --> 34:16.215
It was too powerful ...

35:03.593 --> 35:07.339
My fan was just here somewhere.

35:12.794 --> 35:18.794
It's here. You can take this now.

35:18.995 --> 35:22.490
I mean, if you need there.

39:51.381 --> 39:56.271
Hello, how are you? All right?

44:00.238 --> 44:06.512
Beautiful. Well done.

44:15.460 --> 44:19.158
Spain is progressing fast.
