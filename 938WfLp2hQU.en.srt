00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:21,545
Yesterday I told you about the physical side

2
00:00:23,695 --> 00:00:29,787
how to physically achieve the balance

3
00:00:29,867 --> 00:00:36,799
by doing all these movements and all that
and there is also raising your Kundalini like that

4
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:40,623
and how to put certain chakras in places.

5
00:00:40,703 --> 00:00:44,251
Like first of all the Mooladhara,
which is very important,

6
00:00:44,331 --> 00:00:50,078
Mooladhara Chakra – for that the exercise,
as I told you, has to be with both the feet …

7
00:00:50,158 --> 00:00:55,965
Can We try that again? Just
to put both the feet together …

8
00:00:56,045 --> 00:01:00,687
Now I tried to pull it towards yourself.

9
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:05,811
No, no – with this, now, holding it, yes,

10
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:10,145
towards yourself and push the thing down …

11
00:01:10,225 --> 00:01:19,367
Yes … Now, the other way round, the other
way round you can do it, is to push it downward

12
00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:22,842
and pull your – with the hands – you push it down.

13
00:01:22,922 --> 00:01:26,959
Yes now, push it up – the,
the heels –

14
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:31,629
yes, now, push it towards yourself, again, again.

15
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:35,052
Now put it down on the sides.

16
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,420
It is stiff, I must say. All right, again.

17
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,532
Now I tell you one, you may try another thing for this.

18
00:01:54,612 --> 00:02:00,927
Is to put your, one foot across
and one foot like this, that’s it.

19
00:02:01,007 --> 00:02:05,862
Push it, ha … now it’s better,
that way … now push it up.

20
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:12,605
It is this one, upward, just push it how
much you can, push that down … yes …

21
00:02:12,685 --> 00:02:16,384
push one down and one push up, it is better …

22
00:02:16,464 --> 00:02:20,132
now the other one you do the same way …

23
00:02:23,372 --> 00:02:29,528
push that down at the center, ha … now push that up …

24
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:36,213
with one hand you can push that up, with one hand
you can push that down … would be a better idea …

25
00:02:36,293 --> 00:02:41,652
now like this, like this,
like this … just try, now ah …

26
00:02:41,732 --> 00:02:45,787
hold it from the sides, hold it
from the sides, like he is holding …

27
00:02:45,867 --> 00:02:48,981
no, no, that ha-, that, put it down, your hand, yes.

28
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:52,582
Now hold it this foot with the left hand,

29
00:02:52,662 --> 00:02:57,142
with the left hand, it doesn’t go that side,

30
00:02:57,222 --> 00:03:02,553
it’s like the way he is
sitting … all right, it’s all right.

31
00:03:02,633 --> 00:03:06,409
Now push it, push it down, this one and push that up,

32
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:09,630
push that up and push
this down.

33
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:15,052
Now the other one you try,
now the other one you try, again.

34
00:03:20,382 --> 00:03:21,882
Hmm.

35
00:03:23,322 --> 00:03:25,998
Can you? No, no, no – that one down now.

36
00:03:26,078 --> 00:03:28,972
Which one was, yes, correct, correct, now.

37
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:36,507
This is the other way – ha. Just push that
one down, as much as you can. Push this down.

38
00:03:36,587 --> 00:03:41,783
Now you will see it will little bit opened
out. Now see yourself, is it opening out?

39
00:03:41,863 --> 00:03:48,292
Now put it, put it down again.
See, is it better now for sitting.

40
00:03:48,372 --> 00:03:53,215
Better?

41
00:03:53,295 --> 00:03:55,599
Now see now, is it better?

42
00:03:55,679 --> 00:04:00,625
Like it! It’s better now.

43
00:04:00,706 --> 00:04:01,818
Yogi: Now here.

44
00:04:01,898 --> 00:04:05,391
Shri Mataji: Try it. Yeah. You
see, gradually it will work out,

45
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:09,103
gradually it will work out for you people,
because you are not used to it, not,

46
00:04:09,184 --> 00:04:13,236
so at this age also it’s rather
difficult, but it will work out,

47
00:04:13,316 --> 00:04:17,351
gradually that – … You sit like
that!

48
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:22,449
From now, if she sits like this, you see, from
the very childhood, than she can never sit like that.

49
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:28,623
Can you sit like that? Let’s
see. Let’s see. If – can see? Ah?

50
00:04:28,703 --> 00:04:33,397
Ha good, you can do it, you
are good, excellent, she is good.

51
00:04:33,477 --> 00:04:35,866
Ah, that’s better.
