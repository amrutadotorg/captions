WEBVTT

00:42.454 --> 00:45.636
We close the door, I think it would be good.

01:04.754 --> 01:08.253
I am happy that you all were meditating here,

01:08.399 --> 01:15.024
and were trying to develop your depth.

01:15.337 --> 01:21.919
You all have depth, a very deep personality within yourself.

01:22.046 --> 01:23.577
But we have to touch that,

01:23.649 --> 01:26.067
that's very important,

01:26.312 --> 01:30.895
because you see, we sing, have music, that's a very good thing;

01:31.154 --> 01:34.487
we enjoy each other's company, also is very good

01:34.808 --> 01:36.309
and that's a nice thing.

01:36.551 --> 01:40.384
But we have to enjoy our own company also

01:40.587 --> 01:44.753
by meditating, going within yourself.

01:45.128 --> 01:48.919
Now, "What is the use?"

01:49.006 --> 01:51.507
one may ask. "Mother, now we have got realization,

01:51.574 --> 01:54.971
we have a nice life, we are enjoying ourselves,

01:55.133 --> 01:57.966
we are doing so well."

01:58.200 --> 02:03.546
The deeper you go, the deeper you touch the essences

02:03.682 --> 02:07.348
of all the things, like all the elements.

02:07.613 --> 02:10.070
When you had finished your meditation

02:10.253 --> 02:12.337
you saw how the rain fell down,

02:12.539 --> 02:14.539
how the rain came suddenly.

02:14.733 --> 02:17.483
So rain has felt your depth,

02:17.781 --> 02:20.197
or you have felt the depth of rain.

02:20.395 --> 02:23.312
Now you know that if you light one little candle

02:23.587 --> 02:27.170
and put your finger towards it with My photograph there,

02:27.289 --> 02:30.122
it acts, it reacts

02:30.337 --> 02:32.919
and it gives you a flame which burns,

02:33.086 --> 02:38.003
sometimes gives you smoke, sometimes it gallops.

02:38.253 --> 02:43.754
So you have noticed that there's a reaction, even in the fire.

02:43.920 --> 02:48.503
So all elements have got an effect,

02:48.754 --> 02:54.170
if a saint wants to have an effect.

02:54.378 --> 02:58.253
But first of all you must reach your own essences.

02:58.503 --> 03:00.545
Once you reach your own essences,

03:00.754 --> 03:07.170
then you reach the essences of all the elements,

03:07.337 --> 03:11.170
and then you can handle all the elements as you like

03:11.420 --> 03:13.420
or you can order them as you like.

03:13.587 --> 03:15.503
First they will act,

03:15.754 --> 03:18.003
expressing that they have been touched

03:18.253 --> 03:21.754
like today, the rain came pouring down.

03:21.919 --> 03:25.420
Then later on you can command,

03:25.629 --> 03:28.587
and you can ask the rain to come.

03:28.837 --> 03:32.670
To work out many things of that kind

03:32.919 --> 03:34.754
we have to be deep people,

03:34.920 --> 03:39.253
we have to go much deeper within ourselves to touch our essences.

03:39.503 --> 03:40.754
That is, you know very well

03:40.920 --> 03:44.670
that all our chakras are made out of these essences,

03:44.919 --> 03:47.086
and when we go deep into ourselves,

03:47.337 --> 03:53.170
what we find that we can touch the elements very well.

03:53.420 --> 03:58.337
But while doing so, actually we move horizontally.

03:58.503 --> 04:00.919
When we start moving horizontally,

04:01.086 --> 04:06.503
at the core of it we find that there are these essences placed,

04:06.754 --> 04:11.837
and these essences then start exciting the essences across.

04:12.003 --> 04:15.587
Like in the radio you have seen there's ether.

04:15.795 --> 04:20.545
Now when you speak on one side of the radio,

04:20.754 --> 04:27.754
it gets completely manifested in the essence of the ether

04:27.920 --> 04:30.253
and then everybody can hear it.

04:30.503 --> 04:36.919
Now when you people just give a bandhan sometimes,

04:37.086 --> 04:41.420
you find that you have communicated with another person.

04:41.629 --> 04:47.919
But that's only the essence of the ether

04:48.086 --> 04:51.211
we can say, the subtler of the subtlest.

04:51.420 --> 04:54.170
People have only gone onto the subtler side,

04:54.420 --> 04:56.503
we can say, by science,

04:56.670 --> 05:00.253
but you go to the subtlest side, and that subtlest side

05:00.420 --> 05:02.920
gives you all these effects.

05:03.170 --> 05:06.670
Now you have seen also that in some of the photographs

05:06.837 --> 05:09.920
suddenly you find light coming out of My head,

05:10.170 --> 05:12.919
or there's somebody shown as with the light,

05:13.086 --> 05:15.837
somebody's with the head the light is coming

05:16.003 --> 05:17.337
you have seen all this.

05:17.587 --> 05:21.170
This is done also by the same method,

05:21.420 --> 05:25.670
but here the deities like Vishnumaya works out.

05:25.837 --> 05:28.003
She's very active, She works it out,

05:28.253 --> 05:29.837
She does all these things.

05:30.003 --> 05:33.337
And you know that also that when they gave Me once

05:33.587 --> 05:37.503
a beautiful crown in Switzerland,

05:37.712 --> 05:43.837
in the sky they got the photograph of the same.

05:44.003 --> 05:47.837
Very beautifully done, the crown was there,

05:48.003 --> 05:51.919
Fatima's crown, My face, My eyes and everything so clearly.

05:52.086 --> 05:54.099
All this is done by Vishnumaya.

05:54.361 --> 05:58.151
So all the, all the

06:02.429 --> 06:05.900
all the essences are

06:06.277 --> 06:11.378
working out for you. As well as
all the deities areare working out for you.

06:11.587 --> 06:15.420
They are very anxious that these things should be done,

06:15.587 --> 06:19.503
and you are the channels for them to work it out.

06:19.712 --> 06:22.420
Now for example, as I told you the other day,

06:22.670 --> 06:24.754
if you don't keep yourself all right.

06:24.919 --> 06:28.795
A simple thing I have told you, to put in the nose some ghee.

06:28.961 --> 06:31.837
It's a very simple thing but that helps Me a lot,

06:32.003 --> 06:33.754
because that helps My Vishuddhi.

06:33.919 --> 06:36.295
But if you don't do it I suck in, in any case,

06:36.503 --> 06:38.754
whatever problems you have, I suck in.

06:38.920 --> 06:42.754
I suck in the problem of Sahaja yogis,

06:42.920 --> 06:45.670
also the problem of the city where I am,

06:45.837 --> 06:47.879
also the problem of the country where I am,

06:48.045 --> 06:50.253
maybe of the whole universe.

06:50.503 --> 06:55.503
But My horizontal movement is quite large and is very subtle,

06:55.754 --> 06:57.587
and I do it quietly.

06:57.754 --> 06:59.503
But you must also understand

06:59.670 --> 07:02.920
that you can do a lot by your horizontal movement.

07:03.170 --> 07:05.337
By horizontal movement what happens

07:05.587 --> 07:09.170
that you start meditating on a particular subject

07:09.420 --> 07:11.670
which is a very bothersome subject,

07:11.919 --> 07:15.378
and which is for the destructive of humanity.

07:15.587 --> 07:20.670
Anything -- you just put your attention to it and meditate.

07:20.879 --> 07:22.462
If you are that deep,

07:22.670 --> 07:25.670
that means if your caliber has improved to that extent,

07:25.837 --> 07:29.045
you will immediately put an effect on that.

07:29.253 --> 07:32.253
Immediately you will see there will be a change,

07:32.503 --> 07:35.420
there will be something happening in that direction.

07:35.670 --> 07:38.837
This is your power which you have to actually develop.

07:39.003 --> 07:40.670
So we have to meditate,

07:40.879 --> 07:45.086
and by meditation we develop that strength within us,

07:45.253 --> 07:50.629
so automatically we start solving the problem.

07:50.837 --> 07:54.086
Like our antennae grow up to that point:

07:54.295 --> 08:00.170
the way we are strong inside, they grow outside

08:00.337 --> 08:03.920
to help so many things which are to be helped.

08:04.170 --> 08:06.337
Now you see that people are realizing

08:06.503 --> 08:09.795
that the world is in a great mess,

08:09.961 --> 08:12.003
and there are lots of problems that have come

08:12.253 --> 08:15.003
through materialism, through wrong thinking,

08:15.170 --> 08:19.003
through emotional thinking, through stupidity we can say.

08:19.170 --> 08:21.253
We have no time for all this.

08:21.420 --> 08:25.253
What we have to do is to develop ourselves deeper and deeper

08:25.420 --> 08:31.253
and deeper, so that on horizontal plane also we are effective.

08:31.503 --> 08:35.919
Sahaja Yoga first of all is for personal improvement,

08:36.086 --> 08:40.503
is for the inner improvement as far
as the personal side is concerned

08:40.670 --> 08:44.003
means your intelligence must improve,

08:44.170 --> 08:46.587
your temperament must improve,

08:46.837 --> 08:48.754
your heart must clear out,

08:48.920 --> 08:51.670
your feelings must be all right.

08:51.879 --> 08:55.503
Then you should, your health should be all right,

08:55.754 --> 08:58.670
then your relationship with others should be all right,

08:58.879 --> 09:00.420
your ego should go away,

09:00.670 --> 09:02.337
your superego should go away

09:02.503 --> 09:04.754
all these things are there.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.920
But this only helps a personality,

09:07.170 --> 09:10.920
just a personality that is very limited, that is yourself.

09:11.170 --> 09:14.378
But now this personality can become an instrument,

09:14.587 --> 09:17.503
if you can develop that depth within yourself.

09:17.754 --> 09:20.253
But normally what happens, people are

09:20.420 --> 09:23.253
very much still worried about themselves,

09:23.420 --> 09:25.754
say about their wives, about their children,

09:25.919 --> 09:32.003
about their husbands or their household, or this and that.

09:32.170 --> 09:36.587
These are not important things, because we have to be those

09:36.837 --> 09:40.919
instruments which are what you call them, like pilotless bombs,

09:41.086 --> 09:43.670
we have to develop that depth within us.

09:43.837 --> 09:45.420
That depth is possible,

09:45.670 --> 09:49.920
and you can really cure many problems of your country

09:50.170 --> 09:52.961
if you could just meditate on them.

09:53.170 --> 09:57.754
Now for today, I had actually sucked in most of the problems

09:57.920 --> 10:01.170
which I had felt were there in Canberra

10:01.420 --> 10:07.670
and later on in that conference, and later on here.

10:07.961 --> 10:12.961
All these problems came into My understanding,

10:13.170 --> 10:16.462
I would say, and I was trying to work on them.

10:16.670 --> 10:20.837
My working style is different because I have very sharp

10:21.003 --> 10:23.420
and very effective instruments.

10:23.587 --> 10:26.503
But I have to pay attention to it

10:26.754 --> 10:29.253
and I a little bit suffer also, doesn't matter.

10:29.420 --> 10:33.337
Now for you also, it is important that you also develop

10:33.587 --> 10:35.919
those deeper feelings within you,

10:36.086 --> 10:37.879
deeper sense within you.

10:38.045 --> 10:41.170
But mostly people are very superficial type.

10:41.337 --> 10:43.503
They just think about their body,

10:43.670 --> 10:47.503
their impressions, how they carry themselves.

10:47.754 --> 10:51.837
At the most they'll think we have to be very legal-minded,

10:52.003 --> 10:58.003
or we have to be at the most not drinking, not smoking,

10:58.253 --> 11:03.503
and all these things are achieved and we have achieved everything.

11:03.754 --> 11:06.670
But I think that is not so.

11:06.837 --> 11:10.919
And second point is that we think that if we love each other,

11:11.086 --> 11:14.253
if we love Mother, that is the end of everything.

11:14.503 --> 11:15.837
It's not true also,

11:16.003 --> 11:20.337
because you see, your love for Me is there no doubt

11:20.545 --> 11:22.837
and it should be intense, it should be deeper;

11:23.003 --> 11:24.919
but the deeper you go into that love,

11:25.086 --> 11:30.670
then you will be surprised how you receive a special quality

11:30.837 --> 11:34.503
of correcting the things that are wrong around you.

11:34.754 --> 11:37.503
Gradually that quality improves.

11:37.670 --> 11:41.086
For example, a Sahaja yogi goes to anybody's house,

11:41.253 --> 11:44.754
that house must become auspicious.

11:44.920 --> 11:47.754
But such a Sahaja yogi must have a good heart.

11:47.920 --> 11:52.670
If the heart is not good, in the heart there is still

11:52.919 --> 11:59.587
anger, passion, lust, greed,

11:59.837 --> 12:01.503
then such a heart won't affect.

12:01.754 --> 12:03.837
But a person who has purified himself,

12:04.003 --> 12:08.920
if he goes into any family, any household, any society,

12:09.170 --> 12:12.837
the whole change will take place.

12:13.003 --> 12:15.919
The circumstances will change.

12:16.086 --> 12:19.253
Things that do not work out will start working out immediately.

12:19.420 --> 12:21.211
Like they said, "Mother, as soon as You

12:21.420 --> 12:24.253
sent from this Sunday, everything started working out

12:24.462 --> 12:27.295
as far as the television is concerned

12:27.503 --> 12:29.919
and radio is concerned."

12:30.086 --> 12:34.003
I didn't do anything -- in a way.

12:34.211 --> 12:36.420
But that should happen with you also.

12:36.587 --> 12:41.503
Wherever a saint goes, things are changing.

12:41.670 --> 12:43.587
But you have to be a saint,

12:43.795 --> 12:49.712
and a saintly person has a very deep understanding

12:49.919 --> 12:53.712
of another person,

12:53.919 --> 12:57.754
and this is what it is lacking:

12:57.919 --> 13:01.961
we don't have that deep understanding for each other.

13:02.170 --> 13:07.919
Then even if you have for some of your own friends,

13:08.086 --> 13:12.420
or maybe in the same ashram that you are staying and all that

13:12.670 --> 13:16.337
but it should deepen much more.

13:16.587 --> 13:21.670
You should go further and further.

13:22.378 --> 13:25.795
Now even if you think of Me, it works out.

13:25.961 --> 13:29.003
It's the other way round also.

13:29.253 --> 13:34.337
But first of all the meditative process should be increased.

13:34.503 --> 13:38.128
We all must meditate, that is very important

13:38.337 --> 13:40.961
meditate sincerely.

13:41.170 --> 13:44.754
Not just because we have to meditate

13:44.920 --> 13:51.045
but because we have to be deep, we have to grow within

13:51.253 --> 14:00.295
to express our great powers of divine love;

14:00.503 --> 14:05.170
to correct so many things, which you can do very easily

14:05.337 --> 14:09.295
I know you all can do it.

14:09.503 --> 14:12.754
There's no need to have big degrees for that,

14:12.919 --> 14:16.545
big education for that, nothing is needed.

14:16.754 --> 14:20.837
What is needed is a deep feeling

14:21.003 --> 14:27.086
of love for the whole universe, and that changes.

14:27.253 --> 14:30.754
The all-destructive forces change their course,

14:30.920 --> 14:35.170
and it is then for the constructive forces.

14:35.420 --> 14:43.170
But on the whole that works out much faster if you all

14:43.337 --> 14:49.170
do that meditation with sincerity, with intensity,

14:49.420 --> 14:52.503
with understanding. All right?

14:52.712 --> 14:56.003
May God bless you.

15:01.406 --> 15:04.531
It is much more than our music,

15:04.741 --> 15:09.699
much more than My lectures or anything, that we have to do.

15:09.945 --> 15:11.945
And now the course has to change.

15:12.121 --> 15:16.037
I am sure you people will take to the new course.

15:16.303 --> 15:19.887
So may God bless you for that.

15:23.187 --> 15:25.525
Have you got any questions?

15:47.657 --> 15:52.469
Yogi: There seems to be some difference of opinion on parts

15:52.657 --> 15:59.397
of the body that are represented here, and here, and there.
Could You tell us please, Shri Mataji?

16:02.746 --> 16:04.111
I see.

16:07.201 --> 16:10.272
These chakras are represented outside also

16:10.447 --> 16:13.296
in our body, we can say,

16:13.434 --> 16:17.364
that on our feet as you know:

16:22.591 --> 16:24.945
you know the Nabhi,

16:25.057 --> 16:28.572
Nabhi is the thumb* (you be seated and I’ll tell you; you’ll know)

16:28.829 --> 16:30.710
– Nabhi is the thumb,

16:32.504 --> 16:35.210
and left and right Nabhi.

16:35.605 --> 16:41.540
Then second finger from the thumb is the Vishuddhi,

16:43.334 --> 16:55.587
the third finger is the Swadhishthana,

16:57.436 --> 17:00.965
the fourth finger is the Agya,

17:01.277 --> 17:04.740
and the fifth finger is the Heart.

17:06.365 --> 17:10.619
Now this is the – our basis.

17:11.056 --> 17:13.903
Then in the hands they change,

17:14.308 --> 17:19.419
as you know. In the hands you know very well,
I need not tell about the hands.

17:19.975 --> 17:23.538
Now in your hand,

17:24.180 --> 17:29.536
we can say, this one here is the Lalita Chakra,

17:29.746 --> 17:32.833
also is the part of the Vishuddhi Chakra.

17:33.090 --> 17:36.268
It works out the Vishuddhi Chakra, Lalita Chakra.

17:36.744 --> 17:40.865
And then this is the Nabhi

17:41.628 --> 17:45.430
and this is the Vishuddhi

17:48.796 --> 17:53.802
Swadhishthana is in between, you can say.

17:54.992 --> 17:58.540
Now, Heart is here

17:58.921 --> 18:05.543
so any time you have this finger paining too much,

18:05.686 --> 18:08.662
then you must know there’s some trouble with the Heart.

18:08.785 --> 18:11.578
But Heart is not in all these things,

18:11.761 --> 18:16.723
but sometimes, sometimes it could be felt here

18:16.851 --> 18:21.874
Heart Chakra can be felt here with
a reflection maybe, on this side.

18:22.419 --> 18:25.164
So we can do like this, is to say:

18:25.475 --> 18:30.587
Vishuddhi, Heart, then Nabhi, then Swadhishthana,

18:30.800 --> 18:34.023
and then … sorry!

18:34.563 --> 18:39.028
This is the Vishuddhi

18:42.486 --> 18:44.971
this is Swadhishthana

18:45.211 --> 18:48.441
this is Heart

18:48.720 --> 18:52.073
and this is Nabhi

18:52.629 --> 18:55.350
and this one is

19:01.700 --> 19:06.086
but I never use them, so I just don’t know!

19:09.238 --> 19:15.095
Heart and this is Vishuddhi. All right?

19:16.441 --> 19:19.012
But you can feel it sometimes even Heart here

19:19.160 --> 19:23.160
because if Swadhishthana is very active your Heart goes out,

19:23.240 --> 19:24.747
so you can feel it here.

19:24.899 --> 19:31.926
It’s a very important thing that
we should have that discrimination,

19:32.141 --> 19:35.621
because if I tell you something maybe you are

19:35.700 --> 19:39.835
not yet that level of discretion, and you may get confused.

19:41.812 --> 19:44.588
So this is the Vishuddhi

19:45.566 --> 19:50.593
Now there is pain here, that means there is problem with your Vishuddhi.

19:51.042 --> 19:57.195
Now sometimes you have a problem, say, on your Vishuddhi

19:57.479 --> 20:02.555
– now you can pull this finger. Just to pull the finger nicely,

20:03.127 --> 20:07.860
and you’ll be surprised, the vibrations
coming out of left Vishuddhi.

20:09.248 --> 20:13.263
Any one, you have any problem, you can pull them.

20:13.711 --> 20:18.585
And that is how all the chakras are placed in the body.

20:22.388 --> 20:27.202
In the same way downward if you move, this is the Nabhi

20:27.444 --> 20:30.531
this is the Swadhishthana, both are Swadhishthana

20:30.889 --> 20:38.153
and this is the Heart and

20:44.236 --> 20:48.744
this is the Vishuddhi at the ankle bone.

20:50.457 --> 20:53.699
This is Vishuddhi at the ankle bone.

20:54.046 --> 20:56.958
So the main thing to remember are the Vishuddhis, because

20:57.086 --> 21:00.030
Vishuddhi, Nabhi and Swadhishthan:

21:00.674 --> 21:02.333
these three are important,

21:02.336 --> 21:06.759
because they go off immediately as soon as
– supposing there is a Nabhi patient sitting with you,

21:06.878 --> 21:09.588
you’ll immediately have a problem on your Nabhi

21:09.824 --> 21:13.365
But these sometimes manifest, not all the time,

21:13.552 --> 21:15.607
so they can be confusing.

21:15.694 --> 21:17.693
But Swadhishthana specially.

21:17.901 --> 21:22.577
Like, when I got down in Canberra I just couldn’t walk,
both the Swadhishthanas went like that, you see.

21:22.712 --> 21:24.315
I didn’t know how to move.

21:24.419 --> 21:27.053
It was terrible because both the Swadhishthanas were caught up

21:27.165 --> 21:28.974
– for a while, but they were.

21:29.101 --> 21:32.865
So it is indicative of those things.

21:38.517 --> 21:42.151
Yogi: Shri Mataji, could You please
tell us more about Hamsa Chakra?

21:42.374 --> 21:43.842
Hamsa Chakra?

21:44.981 --> 21:48.362
Hamsa Chakra is placed here

21:48.735 --> 21:51.362
where some of the nerves

21:51.720 --> 21:55.063
which are coming from Ida and Pingala cross over,

21:55.339 --> 22:02.255
and is a part of Vishuddhi Chakra.

22:03.860 --> 22:08.341
Plus the connection with Vishuddhi and Agya:

22:08.511 --> 22:13.075
as you must have read in the Devi Mahatmyam that

22:13.218 --> 22:17.123
Shri Krishna is the Father of Christ,

22:17.584 --> 22:21.959
so the connection between the two is maintained here.

22:22.880 --> 22:25.935
And this is very important, Hamsa Chakra is,

22:26.060 --> 22:31.553
that if your Hamsa Chakra is not all right,
your discretion is very poor.

22:32.748 --> 22:37.079
This chakra will get easily dried out.

22:37.640 --> 22:40.893
Like if you eat very dried food, you see.

22:41.076 --> 22:49.055
Say, sometimes you also offer Me some dried food,
and I have to tell you that not to give too dry food.

22:49.255 --> 22:55.923
You must eat it with some sauce or some liquid thing,
because if you eat very dry food

22:56.040 --> 22:58.150
also this becomes very dry.

22:58.807 --> 23:00.795
And it’s very important

23:00.942 --> 23:04.380
because if this portion becomes dry,

23:04.493 --> 23:09.255
you can put some oil or ghee into it to make it all right.

23:09.605 --> 23:15.850
But from here starts the drying of the peritoneum and the lining.

23:16.747 --> 23:19.348
If the peritoneum gets dried up,

23:19.385 --> 23:21.257
the whole body gets dried up.

23:21.385 --> 23:24.583
It can be anywhere; in the lung if it is dried up

23:24.750 --> 23:26.912
it can cause you lung cancer.

23:27.071 --> 23:31.523
As even the peritoneum can be in a cancer state.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.805
So one has to be very careful not to take something very dry,

23:35.920 --> 23:39.956
all the time dry food and dry things.

23:40.115 --> 23:45.135
Moreover, not to put anything to make this a lubricant

23:46.440 --> 23:51.279
– some sort of a lubricant should be
there so there’s no problem on this chakra.

23:51.680 --> 23:54.954
Because first of all it loses your discretion,

23:55.272 --> 23:58.917
you don’t understand things,
you don’t know what to do. You mean it,

23:59.029 --> 24:05.013
you mean good, but you don’t do.
When you achieve something, it’s something not so good.

24:05.201 --> 24:07.359
The reason is, your discretion is poor.

24:07.511 --> 24:10.967
For that this must not be made dry.

24:16.872 --> 24:19.125
I have told many a times to put some

24:19.300 --> 24:23.395
ghee every day. Get a little bottle of ghee,

24:24.314 --> 24:27.490
keep it with you with a little dropper.

24:27.705 --> 24:29.526
You can put it in the hot water,

24:29.681 --> 24:35.762
you can heat it up every day, and take two drops in the nose

24:35.960 --> 24:40.834
in the night and in the morning time.
It doesn’t take much, but it should be done.

24:41.970 --> 24:44.786
It’s for your good.

24:47.629 --> 24:50.603
That’s the only ritual I think we follow, do we

24:50.700 --> 24:52.562
– have we any other ritual?

24:52.677 --> 24:57.274
We don’t even make a cross!

25:02.141 --> 25:04.438
Anything else?

25:05.682 --> 25:13.184
Yogi: Shri Mother, last two years ago when You were here
at Burwood, You were saying how we’ve gone beyond nirvichara

25:13.319 --> 25:21.706
and we’re into savikalpa, and we’re reaching nirvikalpa.
Could You please tell us a little about savikalpa?

25:26.798 --> 25:31.257
First stage is nirvikalpa where you become thoughtless in between,

25:31.433 --> 25:34.020
then you become, again come to thought,

25:34.197 --> 25:35.704
again you become thoughtless.

25:35.808 --> 25:38.926
That’s a very good stage where you start,

25:39.189 --> 25:44.089
and you start growing up into that.

25:44.447 --> 25:47.945
Now savikalp can be before or after this stage,

25:48.080 --> 25:51.720
like savikalpa is – “vikalpa” means doubt,

25:51.954 --> 25:54.182
and “savikalpa” means with doubt.

25:54.326 --> 25:57.079
So you are still growing with the doubts in your mind.

25:57.240 --> 26:00.119
There are people who still grow with doubts in their mind.

26:00.328 --> 26:04.165
For example you see, somebody feels hurt in Sahaja Yoga,

26:04.372 --> 26:06.331
some way he’s hurt

26:07.728 --> 26:12.367
that “I’ve been hurt in Sahaja Yoga”
– something, the subconscious is there.

26:12.757 --> 26:15.814
Then he still has that feeling within himself, “I’m hurt,

26:15.960 --> 26:19.436
but still I must do Sahaja Yoga, it is good.” Mentally he accepts

26:19.555 --> 26:24.848
and goes on with it, so he can get into nirvikalp state with that.

26:24.957 --> 26:27.369
Or maybe he gets to nirvikalpa state

26:27.473 --> 26:31.676
and then again goes to savikalpa. That’s a flashback.

26:32.240 --> 26:36.560
And could be he can say, “All right, I’ll do it in nirvichara,

26:36.664 --> 26:40.812
but from nirvichara I can go to,

26:40.947 --> 26:46.999
you see, my doubts also. After all I have my doubts,
what things and this and that is possible.”

26:47.111 --> 26:50.397
And some people have a hidden anger within themselves,

26:50.517 --> 26:55.146
or kind of a hidden feelings or hidden things

26:55.242 --> 27:01.033
which he’s not very aware of, too,
so he has also got the vikalpas with him.

27:01.129 --> 27:03.874
So with savikalpa samadhi is that,

27:04.040 --> 27:08.497
so it can be after or before nirvichara samadhi.

27:08.593 --> 27:12.194
So I mean, you go, fall on to it sometime.

27:12.677 --> 27:15.629
So we’ll have to go beyond actually savikalpa,

27:16.353 --> 27:19.103
because nirvichar samadhi is not sufficient enough.

27:19.270 --> 27:22.317
All the vikalpas, all the doubts must go away,

27:22.508 --> 27:25.288
then you’ll reach the state of nirvikalpa.

27:25.439 --> 27:28.239
Then there’s no doubt, there’s no problem.

27:28.526 --> 27:31.670
There are many among you who are like that,

27:32.074 --> 27:34.550
who are not yet aware that they are like that.

27:34.694 --> 27:40.374
That’s why I’m requesting you to develop
this new dimension in your creative work.

27:49.706 --> 27:56.656
Yogi: Shri Mataji, how can we sustain
a deep meditation throughout the day?

27:56.680 --> 28:06.906
I just say, when we reach an hight in meditation,
howe can we sustain it during the whole day.

28:07.163 --> 28:08.793
How can we say?

28:09.245 --> 28:16.131
Other Yogi: How can we sustain that meditation trought out
of the day. Sustaining the meditation that we had in the morning.

28:17.848 --> 28:21.142
You see, you are in meditation in a way.

28:21.476 --> 28:24.888
You are halfway in meditation and halfway not.

28:25.133 --> 28:29.180
Now if you try to develop a state of witness,

28:29.656 --> 28:31.802
then you are in meditation

28:32.049 --> 28:35.239
– just a state of witness. Whatever you see, just watch it.

28:35.463 --> 28:37.073
Just watching is the best way,

28:37.198 --> 28:42.937
and then you’ll be surprised that you will find that
you are in another world, these people are only in another world.

28:43.054 --> 28:44.698
You are seeing them from another world.

28:44.841 --> 28:46.872
Then you will have compassion for them,

28:47.048 --> 28:49.024
you will have pity for them,

28:49.151 --> 28:51.820
you may also not like them –

28:52.007 --> 28:57.229
it’s all these feelings will come up to you,
but you’ll be a person who is separated from them.

29:08.169 --> 29:10.608
[Yogi: Sometimes...

29:11.116 --> 29:15.859
you can feel that you in yourself,
in your center you are all right,

29:16.120 --> 29:22.588
but you move in circumstances
that cause a disharmony in some other part of you.]

29:24.323 --> 29:26.481
That is the savikalpa state.

29:26.825 --> 29:28.658
That is you move, you see,

29:28.821 --> 29:31.406
though you are in that state of

29:32.828 --> 29:36.272
nirvichara, still you move to savikalpa state

29:36.394 --> 29:40.506
where you again get vikalpa. But you are, you are after all

29:40.608 --> 29:43.576
a realized soul, you see. So they have made three

29:43.726 --> 29:47.298
clear-cut things, that you can have savikalpa samadhi,

29:47.806 --> 29:51.353
you can have nirvichara samadhi and you can have

29:51.433 --> 29:53.046
pure nirvikalpa samadhi.

29:53.760 --> 29:56.312
Now from even that state, you see,

29:56.386 --> 29:58.847
you can get to that,

29:58.996 --> 30:01.009
and that’s what you have to cut out –

30:01.223 --> 30:04.128
is to, when you see such a situation

30:04.360 --> 30:09.309
where you get involved, then you say, “This is not, this is not,”

30:09.742 --> 30:11.035
and come out of it.

30:11.419 --> 30:14.260
It’s a practice, a little practice can tell you.

30:14.665 --> 30:18.486
Like driving, by practice you master it in the same way.

30:21.566 --> 30:25.248
When I know something is wrong, I know it is wrong

30:25.292 --> 30:28.827
and I know that they are doing wrong, but I just keep quiet

30:28.857 --> 30:32.657
and then they know what it was wrong and what was right.

30:43.429 --> 30:48.760
It is better to make others learn by mistakes than to tell them.

30:49.084 --> 30:51.251
No one likes to be told.

30:51.564 --> 30:57.268
Then they learn themselves by mistakes,
“Yes, I’ve done this mistake, that mistakes. I’ve ruined my life.

30:57.333 --> 30:58.333
Now come along."

30:58.873 --> 31:05.525
But if you tell them, they can be very
reluctant or could be vindictive also.

31:20.756 --> 31:25.050
[Yogi: Shri Mataji, could You tell us
some more about the conscious mind?]

31:25.170 --> 31:27.875
Shri Mataji: About? – Yogi: the conscious mind.

31:28.405 --> 31:30.008
The conscious mind?
Yogi: Yes.

31:36.263 --> 31:41.418
What do you want to know about the conscious mind?

31:41.709 --> 31:45.446
You see, conscious mind is the mind where you are awake

31:45.914 --> 31:48.203
and see things.

31:48.573 --> 31:51.493
But there is also unconscious mind behind it;

31:51.958 --> 31:55.918
and there’s a subconscious mind, and there’s supraconscious mind,

31:56.591 --> 31:58.849
and beyond the supraconscious

31:59.083 --> 32:01.953
there is also collective supraconscious,

32:02.344 --> 32:06.964
and beyond the subconscious there is collective subconscious.

32:07.149 --> 32:09.083
There’s unconscious mind.

32:09.181 --> 32:13.750
The unconscious mind is in a way, we can say is the Kundalini.

32:15.186 --> 32:21.543
Now when She enters into your
conscious mind, you become enlightened.

32:23.011 --> 32:27.165
The conscious mind is the mind that is aware

32:27.242 --> 32:32.650
of the surroundings, aware of
everyone being there, aware of all the things.

32:33.114 --> 32:36.804
But an enlightened conscious mind which is of a high level

32:36.959 --> 32:40.187
is much more conscious of things than you are.

32:40.296 --> 32:45.701
For example, I am quite conscious
of people who are catching on the Heart,

32:46.400 --> 32:50.028
and I’m quite conscious of the people who are not yet there.

32:50.235 --> 32:54.687
I’m quite conscious of the people who are perfectly there,

32:54.948 --> 32:58.631
and I’m quite conscious of the people who are nowhere near.

32:58.801 --> 33:04.833
But it’s all right for Me, because I with My
conscious mind can raise them up.

33:05.033 --> 33:07.366
So it’s a different situation with Me.

33:07.422 --> 33:12.601
But with other people could be
that your conscious mind is all the time,

33:12.880 --> 33:18.523
depending on your level of advancement,
maybe worried about small, small things.

33:18.648 --> 33:20.826
Like ...

33:21.687 --> 33:27.468
“I have to go home now and it’s getting late,
and will I get a bus or not?” Could be like that.

33:27.714 --> 33:32.041
Then there could be another conscious mind which is thinking about

33:32.168 --> 33:37.088
how far I can meditate,
how far I can go with it, all kinds of things.

33:37.345 --> 33:42.221
But there could be a conscious mind
which is enlightened, if it is enlightened, it’s just

33:43.568 --> 33:46.665
just getting all the

33:47.247 --> 33:49.676
essence of what I am saying,

33:50.152 --> 33:52.500
and developing and nourishing itself.

33:52.921 --> 33:56.402
So when you are enlightened, the conscious mind

33:56.550 --> 33:58.731
is something like a

33:59.264 --> 34:01.981
tree into which the sap is now flowing.

34:02.124 --> 34:05.565
It may be that it is just like a leaf

34:05.872 --> 34:10.582
or it may be it is like a flower, or maybe it is like a fruit.

34:11.227 --> 34:15.566
So it changes its forms once he gets realization.

34:15.858 --> 34:21.179
If a person gets realization then
the conscious mind moves on, getting more and more light.

34:21.222 --> 34:23.554
Say for example when the electricity comes

34:23.739 --> 34:27.330
you can see this room, you can see
another’s room, you can see another room,

34:27.553 --> 34:33.061
you can go round and see and again, again you will see
it all the rooms, then you become aware of all the rooms

34:33.271 --> 34:35.286
So you are conscious of all these.

34:35.429 --> 34:39.169
But in the beginning you are just
conscious of the room where you are standing.

34:39.333 --> 34:40.359
Isn’t it?

34:40.484 --> 34:42.399
So the conscious mind’s

34:42.577 --> 34:45.256
definition cannot be given after realization.

34:45.458 --> 34:51.754
A person like Me, say for example, has a
conscious mind that might envelop the whole world.

34:51.942 --> 34:55.045
Or a conscious mind of a person who is realized soul

34:55.219 --> 34:58.022
who is still not anywhere, just started,

34:58.239 --> 35:03.850
then he’s only conscious as to
where is right, where is left, where is this.

35:06.259 --> 35:10.784
So before the realization
the conscious mind sees things around.

35:10.977 --> 35:13.413
Out of that also there are categories.

35:13.518 --> 35:16.160
Some people see, say, for artists can see something,

35:16.464 --> 35:19.290
and a scientist can see something,

35:19.502 --> 35:22.121
another poet will see something,

35:22.328 --> 35:25.296
so it depends on the conscious mind how it is,

35:25.539 --> 35:27.681
has got the trend. But

35:28.278 --> 35:32.803
still it won’t see something that is subtle behind it.

35:33.199 --> 35:37.156
And that only is possible after you get your realization.

35:37.792 --> 35:38.887
All right?

35:42.972 --> 35:48.805
Yogi: Mother, sometimes ego masquerades as guru.

35:50.368 --> 35:53.933
How can we tell when that’s going on in us?

35:56.923 --> 36:00.829
You see, when ego comes up

36:01.594 --> 36:07.435
– I don’t know much about it, you see, because I haven’t got!

36:11.365 --> 36:14.414
We can say when ego comes up,

36:14.637 --> 36:18.589
then a person becomes arbitrary.
First thing is he becomes arbitrary.

36:19.019 --> 36:23.394
It start, He’ll start deciding, “I’ll have this, I’ll have that,

36:23.562 --> 36:27.449
I like this” – you see? This is the one thing.

36:27.659 --> 36:32.151
Secondly it takes out itself from the collective,

36:32.516 --> 36:36.601
becomes very arbitrary, collective removes itself from you.

36:37.161 --> 36:39.668
But the spirit is the other way round.

36:39.800 --> 36:43.106
Spirit is, it cares for the collective.

36:43.806 --> 36:46.392
It doesn’t become arbitrary at all

36:46.535 --> 36:51.376
and it never says “I like, I want.” Its “I” drops out.

36:51.779 --> 36:55.862
You see, you can easily see, very easily with your discrimination

36:56.068 --> 36:59.013
that egoistical person

36:59.235 --> 37:02.787
is not even liked by the person who has ego.

37:03.552 --> 37:09.887
If he sees himself in the mirror he says,
“Oh God, what’s this wretched nonsense? What a temperament it is!”

37:10.116 --> 37:12.044
It will not like itself.

37:12.947 --> 37:17.344
There was a lady who was a very hot-tempered woman

37:17.646 --> 37:22.258
and once she came to My puja,
and I said, “Now what is this heater you have brought before Me

37:22.351 --> 37:26.528
in India in the hot season" – one heater put before you.

37:26.764 --> 37:30.504
I said, “Oh God, please remove her, she’s like a heater.”

37:30.834 --> 37:32.639
Nobody understood it, you see,

37:32.794 --> 37:37.868
but I said, “Please remove her.”
So then they asked her, “You get down. Mother can’t bear you.”

37:38.388 --> 37:43.805
Then she was very angry,“What is this?
What’s wrong with me? What have I done?”

37:44.593 --> 37:46.133
After some time, you see,

37:46.251 --> 37:51.901
people said that “we have nothing to do.”
Then nobody would talk to her, she was left alone,

37:52.222 --> 37:57.367
and then she was also very unhappy about it because
she was left alone. She thought, “What’s this? This is insulting.

37:57.415 --> 37:59.304
Why should they leave me alone?”

37:59.880 --> 38:01.332
Then after some time

38:01.459 --> 38:05.846
she realized that “There must be something wrong with me,

38:06.193 --> 38:10.693
I must find out. There’s something
nonsensical about it, something filthy on me.

38:10.851 --> 38:12.215
I should throw it away.”

38:12.682 --> 38:18.844
Then she started working it out and seeing
herself and all that, and she became a very, very sweet person.

38:19.137 --> 38:22.237
But she dare not face Me, was quite afraid.

38:22.780 --> 38:26.740
So her daughter came to see Me one day.
I said, “How is your mother?”

38:26.788 --> 38:30.436
She said, “Mother, she’s all right.”
“You ask her to come and see Me.”

38:30.919 --> 38:33.580
So she said, “And I have never felt such joy

38:33.659 --> 38:38.005
as I felt that day when You called me.”
I said, “I knew you have improved so much.”

38:38.108 --> 38:40.039
She came. I had taken a watch for her.

38:40.133 --> 38:43.893
She said, “Mother, You have brought a watch for me?”
I said, “Yes, I have brought a watch for you.”

38:43.939 --> 38:48.651
She said, “Thank God that filth is gone, thank God! Fed up of it!”

38:48.987 --> 38:53.956
That’s how when you develop, then
that sweetness, the beauty, everything comes up.

38:54.617 --> 38:56.662
But you see the ego is,

38:56.852 --> 39:01.158
if you play upon your ego it adheres to you.

39:01.424 --> 39:05.209
You get identified with it, and you cannot get rid of it.

39:05.373 --> 39:08.477
But I have seen one case which is such a beautiful case is,

39:08.695 --> 39:15.072
and I was sitting in My room and I could feel with the
child when she came in. And I asked her, “Where is your mother?”

39:15.262 --> 39:20.024
She was herself surprised. When she told her mother.
She said, “I’ve never had such a joy!

39:20.419 --> 39:21.878
Such a joy I had

39:22.156 --> 39:27.023
that, oh, Mother has recognized me.”
I said, “I always recognized you.”

39:28.245 --> 39:30.704
So this is what it is.

39:45.740 --> 39:54.722
Yogini: The Sahastrara is represented by the lotus...

39:55.635 --> 40:01.409
What she said?
Yogi: You have to speek up. Stand up.
Shri Mataji: Please.

40:01.568 --> 40:06.245
Yogini: The Sahastrara is represented by the lotus flower.

40:06.554 --> 40:12.979
Yogi repeats: The Sahastrara is represented by the lotus flower

40:13.500 --> 40:23.996
Yogini: At the moment, if the lotus flower,
starting to lose its petals and the fruit developed?

40:28.569 --> 40:32.509
Yogi: The Sahastrara is represented by the lotus,

40:32.714 --> 40:37.359
and is the lotus at the moment...is the lotus loosing its petals?

40:37.565 --> 40:39.890
And the fruit developing.

40:42.011 --> 40:48.179
You see, it is represented as lotus
because our brain is like a lotus, actually.

40:48.569 --> 40:51.557
If you cut it horizontally you can see

40:51.677 --> 40:55.349
as if you have cut the petals,

40:55.745 --> 40:59.209
and if you cut it vertically

40:59.448 --> 41:02.236
you can see that around the

41:02.410 --> 41:07.134
around the limbic area it is just like petals of lotus

41:07.570 --> 41:12.291
But when you are enlightened
what happens, they swell up and they open out,

41:12.482 --> 41:14.974
and they all have beautiful colors.

41:15.101 --> 41:18.442
They look like tongues of flames, it’s very beautiful.

41:18.840 --> 41:21.363
Now the Sahastrara is open

41:21.634 --> 41:23.791
and the lotus is open,

41:23.911 --> 41:28.250
and inside you find the fruit already there kept,

41:28.432 --> 41:31.820
which is the Agya Chakra, which sits there.

41:32.164 --> 41:36.505
You can see it very clearly. Agnya is yellow,

41:37.602 --> 41:41.130
yellow-covered as we say,

41:41.209 --> 41:44.666
like a gold cap

41:44.791 --> 41:48.250
is the Agnya there, beautiful Agnya is inside.

41:48.440 --> 41:54.253
Now the fruit of the lotus

41:54.975 --> 41:57.989
is later on we see,

41:58.434 --> 42:04.741
and I would say that is called
as Bindu state, where you become a bindu

42:05.400 --> 42:09.090
– a dot, it’s a little dot

42:09.387 --> 42:11.672
– and that dot has to then grow.

42:12.124 --> 42:14.552
So it’s the second stage starts

42:14.589 --> 42:17.597
when you become the fruit of the lotus.

42:26.475 --> 42:32.114
Yogi: Shri Mother, could You say something
about these higher chakras above the Sahasrara?

42:32.415 --> 42:33.959
Shri Mataji: What chakra?

42:34.269 --> 42:42.901
Yogi: I heard people talk about Bindu and
Adi Bindu and the higher chakras above that?

42:43.611 --> 42:46.912
You see, I don’t think you should worry too much about these.

42:47.340 --> 42:52.758
These three stages higher than Sahastrara.

42:53.885 --> 42:56.184
I would suggest just now

42:56.311 --> 42:59.790
let us concentrate on Sahastrara, is a better idea.

43:00.464 --> 43:04.537
But Bindu, Ardha-Bindu and Valaya are the three stages

43:04.609 --> 43:07.459
in which one has to pass through later on,

43:07.838 --> 43:10.395
and you would pass gradually

43:10.647 --> 43:13.155
when you develop yourself horizontally.

43:13.329 --> 43:15.329
That’s what we have started now,

43:15.464 --> 43:20.248
so let us keep to this idea that
we have to develop ourself horizontally.

43:20.628 --> 43:23.744
We should see how we affect

43:24.615 --> 43:26.927
the other person,

43:27.047 --> 43:29.999
how we influence the another person.

43:30.119 --> 43:34.701
For example some people, you see,
they are very egoistical and all that,

43:34.852 --> 43:40.669
they may come in contact with you
and say, “Oh, very nice person, charming person, this, that.”

43:40.878 --> 43:46.226
But actually that person is just
very physically may be attractive, or

43:46.350 --> 43:52.504
or may be a little brilliant type of person but doesn’t have anything much in it.

43:52.631 --> 43:56.399
But if that person standing next to you, changes

43:56.665 --> 43:59.217
the mood and temperament of another person,

43:59.460 --> 44:03.798
then you can say that this person has a spiritual personality.

44:04.385 --> 44:07.008
So let us see how you affect the nature.

44:07.170 --> 44:08.554
Flowers

44:08.704 --> 44:13.099
– you saw the miracle of the flowers
that I performed for you  the other day.

44:13.603 --> 44:15.174
In the same way

44:15.246 --> 44:19.430
let us see what is the effect of your character on the

44:19.830 --> 44:23.602
on the trees, on your friends,

44:23.702 --> 44:26.057
or in the food that you make – everything

44:26.114 --> 44:28.122
everything changes, it’s very beautiful.

44:28.320 --> 44:31.206
So we have to see that, how it works out.

44:31.318 --> 44:36.246
I have known people who have never known
what is poetry is, suddenly they become poets.

44:36.514 --> 44:39.456
Some who were never musicians started singing so well.

44:39.583 --> 44:41.321
Like Christine, you know Christine,

44:41.411 --> 44:44.086
she never used to sing, she had a horrible voice.

44:44.308 --> 44:48.764
And suddenly she started singing like a cuckoo-bird!

44:51.858 --> 44:57.213
So not only you, but on others
what effect is had? What others feel about you?

44:57.384 --> 44:59.200
You see, how you are kind,

44:59.293 --> 45:03.861
good and sweet to others, not superficially,

45:04.042 --> 45:07.658
but your behavior should change another person,

45:08.103 --> 45:10.034
transform another person.

45:10.095 --> 45:14.402
Your presence should bring auspiciousness.

45:36.124 --> 45:47.229
[Yogi: Shri Mataji, how can we develop
that same heart that poets like Kabir have for You?]

45:47.565 --> 45:51.623
Shri Mataji: Same heart as what? - Yogi: Kabir, like Kabir.

45:52.725 --> 45:54.011
Why not?

45:56.197 --> 45:58.661
See the handicap of Kabir.

45:59.581 --> 46:01.581
You have no handicaps.

46:02.159 --> 46:06.073
Kabir had no Mother to tell him, no Mother to love him,

46:06.278 --> 46:09.270
look after him and tell him all these things.

46:10.015 --> 46:13.548
He had a guru, if you know Kabir’s life.

46:13.801 --> 46:21.431
Kabir wanted to become the disciple of Ramananda Swami,

46:21.779 --> 46:25.692
but he was a Muslim or low-caste or whatever it is,

46:26.081 --> 46:29.521
so he could not  reach Ramanand Swami.

46:29.662 --> 46:33.914
The disciples would not allow him to go near Ramanand Swami.

46:34.143 --> 46:42.212
So one day Kabira went and slept on the

46:43.151 --> 46:48.943
steps of the River Ganges, all night in the cold

46:49.097 --> 46:52.108
waiting for Ramanand Swami to come,

46:52.299 --> 46:55.351
because he used to always pass the same way.

46:55.637 --> 47:00.237
And his feet fell on Kabira

47:00.628 --> 47:04.453
and he said, “Oh my child, what are you doing here?”

47:04.875 --> 47:10.590
So Kabira got up and he said, “Sir,
you have accepted me as your disciple today.”

47:10.590 --> 47:12.162
He said, “Yes, I have.”

47:12.237 --> 47:16.173
And then Ramanand Swami took him and he

47:16.296 --> 47:18.414
trained him into something great.

47:18.598 --> 47:21.184
You don’t have these handicaps,

47:21.584 --> 47:26.175
where Kabira never had anybody to support him or help him around.

47:26.361 --> 47:29.709
Actually single-handed he fought the whole world.

47:31.279 --> 47:35.950
Horrible people were around him; even today those who are

47:36.632 --> 47:42.064
in his place in Patna on all places where he lived

47:42.233 --> 47:46.600
– I was self surprised that he described Kundalini as “surathi”

47:46.745 --> 47:49.140
and they described tobacco as “surathi.”

47:49.282 --> 47:53.346
Such horrible nonsensical people, making fun of everything.

47:53.806 --> 47:56.738
There Kabira lived and developed that heart.

47:56.837 --> 48:00.543
You don’t have all these handicaps, at all.

48:00.872 --> 48:05.342
You all speak the same language, you live with the same ideas,

48:05.507 --> 48:09.065
you have your own Mother to tell you everything,

48:09.168 --> 48:14.097
so you can develop the same heart as Kabira had.

48:17.344 --> 48:26.539
Yogi: Mother, when I meditate sometimes I can see beautiful,

48:26.936 --> 48:38.968
like a massive flower coming out of the head or a beautiful,
sort of a golden like, almost like a vase.

48:39.252 --> 48:49.059
And I’ve been asking people, and they don’t know
really the answer, and I don’t know it either.

48:49.382 --> 48:52.374
That’s the Kundalini that you see.

48:52.550 --> 48:54.566
It is like a telescope, you see

48:54.765 --> 49:02.774
like a goldenish, yellowish sort of a, like a heated, like iron...

49:02.972 --> 49:04.473
Yogi: It’s like a furnace.

49:04.679 --> 49:07.775
Yes, furnace, it’s like a furnace. That’s the Kundalini you see,

49:07.910 --> 49:11.251
and that’s a good thing to see. But when you see you are not there,

49:11.424 --> 49:16.606
so it’s better is not to see that. But what you see is that,

49:16.726 --> 49:19.794
is the Kundalini. It’s good, I mean seeing is very good,

49:19.936 --> 49:24.511
but to go beyond it. Say,
“No, I don’t want to see it. Now I want to enter into it.”

49:24.707 --> 49:30.489
Yogi: Yes. Last night for instance
I was sleeping with my little girl,

49:30.656 --> 49:38.857
and in her bed she asked me to come. And we meditated,
and it was enormous and I woke up, suddenly woke up.

49:39.102 --> 49:40.618
In your dream you saw?

49:40.804 --> 49:44.710
Yogi: I don’t know whether it was a dream or
whether I was still meditating, but ….

49:44.885 --> 49:46.734
In dream if you see is very good,

49:46.877 --> 49:51.498
but otherwise in meditation you should not see it.
In the dream if you see, is very good.

49:51.689 --> 49:56.520
It’s the Kundalini itself, it’s like a furnace,
it looks like a silent burning furnace.

49:56.650 --> 50:00.204
Yogi: Sometimes like fireworks. It’s quite beautiful.

50:00.520 --> 50:07.168
Yes. But you shouldn’t see it
anymore, all right? Try to avoid.

50:08.999 --> 50:13.610
Yogi: Shri Mataji, could You just say
something about how we pure attention?

50:13.832 --> 50:17.835
Shri Mataji: Pure?
Yogi: Pure attention, how we purify the attention.

50:17.995 --> 50:22.787
How we look beyond the human form
and the differences between each other?

50:22.947 --> 50:25.387
Pure attention?

50:26.457 --> 50:32.781
You see, your attention gets spoilt
that when you put attention – say I put attention onto this glass,

50:32.845 --> 50:37.285
then I start thinking about this glass that
“Oh, it’s a beautiful glass so now,

50:37.476 --> 50:40.126
so it’s a very beautifully done one.

50:40.337 --> 50:44.487
Now somehow or other I should manage to steal it!”

50:57.535 --> 51:04.871
Then attention moves further, “How can I manage to steal this?

51:05.917 --> 51:09.642
And what should I do, what is the best way of stealing it?”

51:09.784 --> 51:15.875
and all those things. So the attention gives,
you see, into problems and problems because I have got

51:16.057 --> 51:19.559
for this a greed, I develop a greed.

51:19.670 --> 51:23.930
How I’ve developed? Because you see, supposing

51:24.555 --> 51:29.714
I put My attention to it and then a thought
starts from there coming to Me,

51:29.817 --> 51:32.949
a reaction as such, this gives you a reaction.

51:33.108 --> 51:35.966
Then you start seeing a beautiful Ganesha there,

51:36.038 --> 51:38.688
then you say, “Oh, I have never seen one like this!”

51:38.783 --> 51:41.691
Like that the thought starts, you see,coming from all this.

51:41.798 --> 51:44.369
And that thought comes into My mind

51:44.418 --> 51:47.978
and gives Me ideas that I should do something like that,

51:48.069 --> 51:49.973
to steal the glass. All right?

51:50.113 --> 51:55.113
Now, the pure attention would be
that I just watch this without thinking.

51:56.446 --> 52:01.152
Anywhere that your attention goes and you start sort of

52:01.552 --> 52:06.321
getting involved into it or getting attached to it,

52:06.477 --> 52:11.286
you should try to just watch it without thinking.

52:11.556 --> 52:14.703
Go into thoughtless awareness, then you enjoy it the most.

52:14.826 --> 52:18.616
Now say for example, these carpets are very nice.

52:18.973 --> 52:24.009
One thing would be, if they belonged to Me
I would be worried how to insure them

52:24.092 --> 52:29.257
all these people aresitting, that would be spoilt, this, hat –
all these thoughts will come into My head.

52:29.460 --> 52:33.850
Supposing these belonged to you, then I’ll think how to manage to

52:34.253 --> 52:38.328
take them with Me somehow,

52:44.443 --> 52:51.803
and how to suggest in a very clever way
something that I can manage to take them away!

52:53.407 --> 52:58.018
Now that is quite human and one can do that way,

52:58.126 --> 53:03.269
but beyond that all cleverness and cunning,

53:03.996 --> 53:06.082
best is to appreciate.

53:06.257 --> 53:09.981
How? By just looking at it without any thought.

53:10.337 --> 53:15.854
Artist has created it, he has put all
his joy into it. I’m just enjoying the joy,

53:16.291 --> 53:17.666
just looking at it.

53:17.791 --> 53:24.802
So when you start enjoying the joy
your attention will become pure, very pure.

53:25.209 --> 53:28.949
Because the enjoyment of it is, this makes you

53:29.037 --> 53:34.041
a very sort of a dedicated person about it,

53:34.244 --> 53:37.829
because you feel that what is in this world after all?

53:38.143 --> 53:43.627
It’s to enjoy. And if I have to enjoy
everything, then why should I worry

53:43.811 --> 53:52.677
about getting it to Myself or stealing it,
or doing all these tricks? Better is to enjoy.

53:54.022 --> 54:00.299
So the reward of it is so great
that attention starts purifying itself.

54:01.750 --> 54:06.618
[Yogi: We tend to sort of react to
things before we even know that we’ve reacted.

54:06.750 --> 54:11.016
It seems to be such a fast process
that we look and we react in seconds.]

54:11.601 --> 54:17.418
Yes, in the beginning it is,
because you are coming from that, you see, style

54:17.606 --> 54:22.811
to the other style.
But once you settle in this style, then you’ll just react

54:23.040 --> 54:25.889
in this manner that you’ll just watch.

54:26.295 --> 54:29.477
But it otherwise also works out. I’ll tell you a story.

54:29.871 --> 54:36.662
They had given Me about sixteen
beautiful crowns – of course I couldn’t wear them

54:36.845 --> 54:42.320
– for this Krishna Puja in Switzerland, and

54:43.069 --> 54:47.810
all the English were bringing them, “smuggling” them into England,

54:48.200 --> 54:51.102
and all these boxes were kept.

54:51.467 --> 54:53.491
So when they reached the custom

54:53.583 --> 54:58.659
post, the custom post asked them,
“What are all these?” They said, “All right, you can have a look."

54:58.920 --> 55:00.967
So they passed on one to them.

55:01.119 --> 55:05.194
So the first fellow looked at it and then he passed to another one,

55:05.318 --> 55:11.636
then another one given. Like that
four were passed on to them, and they were all looking at it.

55:11.887 --> 55:16.865
And then they said, “Now what do you say?”
Nothing. They closed it and gave it to them.

55:18.048 --> 55:23.796
Then they looked back – these boys,
what has happened to them where they were?

55:24.026 --> 55:27.430
They just were moving like this.

55:27.662 --> 55:32.431
And so many cars passed but these people
never looked at any cars, they were just ….

55:33.146 --> 55:36.994
So they had a bliss casualty

55:44.640 --> 55:48.418
– also this can happen, bliss casualty!

55:55.364 --> 56:00.447
So better to see things which can cause bliss casualty!

56:01.290 --> 56:06.944
And once you get into that habit,
then you don’t take to other useless things.

56:07.362 --> 56:11.941
Then you like to see only things which can give you bliss.

56:12.627 --> 56:14.730
Your attention changes.

56:18.198 --> 56:21.650
Yogi: Mother, please, what is the Aumkara?

56:22.078 --> 56:23.552
The Aumkara?

56:23.894 --> 56:25.703
Is the first sound.

56:26.616 --> 56:35.168
When the Shakti departed from Sadashiva,

56:35.612 --> 56:39.608
from the God Almighty – His Power, His Desire

56:39.867 --> 56:42.343
departed – it made the first sound:

56:42.566 --> 56:45.828
that’s the first Child, we say, of God.

56:46.541 --> 56:49.541
That’s Aumkara. A-U-M is the thing,

56:49.890 --> 56:54.940
and these are the three Powers which are represented

56:56.646 --> 57:00.288
as Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati.

57:00.690 --> 57:07.611
And also all these are combined together to form Shri Ganesh.

57:12.927 --> 57:15.784
Yogi: Mother, what is Your vision for Sahaja Yoga?

57:15.991 --> 57:22.139
Shri Mataji: What is the…?
Yogi: What is Your vision for Sahaja Yoga?

57:25.589 --> 57:29.271
This is the one, started already!

57:30.602 --> 57:34.752
My vision for Sahaja Yoga is that, that

57:35.952 --> 57:39.288
all the good people, righteous people,

57:40.348 --> 57:42.507
God-loving people

57:42.895 --> 57:48.959
will rise above all that is useless, worldly,

57:49.814 --> 57:54.048
and reside in the Heavens

57:54.260 --> 57:59.900
with all the blessings of God, for ever and ever.

58:08.095 --> 58:09.095
All right?

58:09.611 --> 58:14.301
So we can have a music,
because without that you won’t feel it is complete.

58:16.631 --> 58:19.901
Let’s hear the song …

58:28.530 --> 58:33.347
Did you hear the tape from Pune children?

58:33.773 --> 58:37.272
Wasn’t it fine? Very good, isn’t it?

58:37.943 --> 58:41.622
You have to make copies of that and send it over.

58:41.888 --> 58:47.066
It’s very good music and very good songs …
Yogi: Queen of Sahasrara...

58:50.942 --> 58:54.799
Such small girls they are, you see, all of them.

58:55.019 --> 58:58.078
They have made and composed everything done,

58:58.343 --> 59:03.682
and sang so clearly. It’s really remarkable.
Nobody has taught them anything.
