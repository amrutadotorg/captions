00:00:42.454 --> 00:00:45.636
We close the door, I think it would be good.

00:01:04.754 --> 00:01:08.253
I am happy that you all were meditating here,

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:15.024
and were trying to develop your depth.

00:01:15.337 --> 00:01:21.919
You all have depth, a very deep personality within yourself.

00:01:22.046 --> 00:01:23.577
But we have to touch that,

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.067
that's very important,

00:01:26.312 --> 00:01:30.895
because you see, we sing, have music, that's a very good thing;

00:01:31.154 --> 00:01:34.487
we enjoy each other's company, also is very good

00:01:34.808 --> 00:01:36.309
and that's a nice thing.

00:01:36.551 --> 00:01:40.384
But we have to enjoy our own company also

00:01:40.587 --> 00:01:44.753
by meditating, going within yourself.

00:01:45.128 --> 00:01:48.919
Now, "What is the use?"

00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:51.507
one may ask. "Mother, now we have got realization,

00:01:51.574 --> 00:01:54.971
we have a nice life, we are enjoying ourselves,

00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:57.966
we are doing so well."

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.546
The deeper you go, the deeper you touch the essences

00:02:03.682 --> 00:02:07.348
of all the things, like all the elements.

00:02:07.613 --> 00:02:10.070
When you had finished your meditation

00:02:10.253 --> 00:02:12.337
you saw how the rain fell down,

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:14.539
how the rain came suddenly.

00:02:14.733 --> 00:02:17.483
So rain has felt your depth,

00:02:17.781 --> 00:02:20.197
or you have felt the depth of rain.

00:02:20.395 --> 00:02:23.312
Now you know that if you light one little candle

00:02:23.587 --> 00:02:27.170
and put your finger towards it with My photograph there,

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:30.122
it acts, it reacts

00:02:30.337 --> 00:02:32.919
and it gives you a flame which burns,

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:38.003
sometimes gives you smoke, sometimes it gallops.

00:02:38.253 --> 00:02:43.754
So you have noticed that there's a reaction, even in the fire.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.503
So all elements have got an effect,

00:02:48.754 --> 00:02:54.170
if a saint wants to have an effect.

00:02:54.378 --> 00:02:58.253
But first of all you must reach your own essences.

00:02:58.503 --> 00:03:00.545
Once you reach your own essences,

00:03:00.754 --> 00:03:07.170
then you reach the essences of all the elements,

00:03:07.337 --> 00:03:11.170
and then you can handle all the elements as you like

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.420
or you can order them as you like.

00:03:13.587 --> 00:03:15.503
First they will act,

00:03:15.754 --> 00:03:18.003
expressing that they have been touched

00:03:18.253 --> 00:03:21.754
like today, the rain came pouring down.

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:25.420
Then later on you can command,

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.587
and you can ask the rain to come.

00:03:28.837 --> 00:03:32.670
To work out many things of that kind

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:34.754
we have to be deep people,

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.253
we have to go much deeper within ourselves to touch our essences.

00:03:39.503 --> 00:03:40.754
That is, you know very well

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.670
that all our chakras are made out of these essences,

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.086
and when we go deep into ourselves,

00:03:47.337 --> 00:03:53.170
what we find that we can touch the elements very well.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.337
But while doing so, actually we move horizontally.

00:03:58.503 --> 00:04:00.919
When we start moving horizontally,

00:04:01.086 --> 00:04:06.503
at the core of it we find that there are these essences placed,

00:04:06.754 --> 00:04:11.837
and these essences then start exciting the essences across.

00:04:12.003 --> 00:04:15.587
Like in the radio you have seen there's ether.

00:04:15.795 --> 00:04:20.545
Now when you speak on one side of the radio,

00:04:20.754 --> 00:04:27.754
it gets completely manifested in the essence of the ether

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.253
and then everybody can hear it.

00:04:30.503 --> 00:04:36.919
Now when you people just give a bandhan sometimes,

00:04:37.086 --> 00:04:41.420
you find that you have communicated with another person.

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:47.919
But that's only the essence of the ether

00:04:48.086 --> 00:04:51.211
we can say, the subtler of the subtlest.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.170
People have only gone onto the subtler side,

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.503
we can say, by science,

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.253
but you go to the subtlest side, and that subtlest side

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.920
gives you all these effects.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.670
Now you have seen also that in some of the photographs

00:05:06.837 --> 00:05:09.920
suddenly you find light coming out of My head,

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.919
or there's somebody shown as with the light,

00:05:13.086 --> 00:05:15.837
somebody's with the head the light is coming

00:05:16.003 --> 00:05:17.337
you have seen all this.

00:05:17.587 --> 00:05:21.170
This is done also by the same method,

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.670
but here the deities like Vishnumaya works out.

00:05:25.837 --> 00:05:28.003
She's very active, She works it out,

00:05:28.253 --> 00:05:29.837
She does all these things.

00:05:30.003 --> 00:05:33.337
And you know that also that when they gave Me once

00:05:33.587 --> 00:05:37.503
a beautiful crown in Switzerland,

00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:43.837
in the sky they got the photograph of the same.

00:05:44.003 --> 00:05:47.837
Very beautifully done, the crown was there,

00:05:48.003 --> 00:05:51.919
Fatima's crown, My face, My eyes and everything so clearly.

00:05:52.086 --> 00:05:54.099
All this is done by Vishnumaya.

00:05:54.361 --> 00:05:58.151
So all the, all the

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:05.900
all the essences are

00:06:06.277 --> 00:06:11.378
working out for you. As well as
all the deities areare working out for you.

00:06:11.587 --> 00:06:15.420
They are very anxious that these things should be done,

00:06:15.587 --> 00:06:19.503
and you are the channels for them to work it out.

00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:22.420
Now for example, as I told you the other day,

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.754
if you don't keep yourself all right.

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:28.795
A simple thing I have told you, to put in the nose some ghee.

00:06:28.961 --> 00:06:31.837
It's a very simple thing but that helps Me a lot,

00:06:32.003 --> 00:06:33.754
because that helps My Vishuddhi.

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:36.295
But if you don't do it I suck in, in any case,

00:06:36.503 --> 00:06:38.754
whatever problems you have, I suck in.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.754
I suck in the problem of Sahaja yogis,

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.670
also the problem of the city where I am,

00:06:45.837 --> 00:06:47.879
also the problem of the country where I am,

00:06:48.045 --> 00:06:50.253
maybe of the whole universe.

00:06:50.503 --> 00:06:55.503
But My horizontal movement is quite large and is very subtle,

00:06:55.754 --> 00:06:57.587
and I do it quietly.

00:06:57.754 --> 00:06:59.503
But you must also understand

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.920
that you can do a lot by your horizontal movement.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.337
By horizontal movement what happens

00:07:05.587 --> 00:07:09.170
that you start meditating on a particular subject

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.670
which is a very bothersome subject,

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:15.378
and which is for the destructive of humanity.

00:07:15.587 --> 00:07:20.670
Anything -- you just put your attention to it and meditate.

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:22.462
If you are that deep,

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.670
that means if your caliber has improved to that extent,

00:07:25.837 --> 00:07:29.045
you will immediately put an effect on that.

00:07:29.253 --> 00:07:32.253
Immediately you will see there will be a change,

00:07:32.503 --> 00:07:35.420
there will be something happening in that direction.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:38.837
This is your power which you have to actually develop.

00:07:39.003 --> 00:07:40.670
So we have to meditate,

00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:45.086
and by meditation we develop that strength within us,

00:07:45.253 --> 00:07:50.629
so automatically we start solving the problem.

00:07:50.837 --> 00:07:54.086
Like our antennae grow up to that point:

00:07:54.295 --> 00:08:00.170
the way we are strong inside, they grow outside

00:08:00.337 --> 00:08:03.920
to help so many things which are to be helped.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:06.337
Now you see that people are realizing

00:08:06.503 --> 00:08:09.795
that the world is in a great mess,

00:08:09.961 --> 00:08:12.003
and there are lots of problems that have come

00:08:12.253 --> 00:08:15.003
through materialism, through wrong thinking,

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:19.003
through emotional thinking, through stupidity we can say.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.253
We have no time for all this.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:25.253
What we have to do is to develop ourselves deeper and deeper

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:31.253
and deeper, so that on horizontal plane also we are effective.

00:08:31.503 --> 00:08:35.919
Sahaja Yoga first of all is for personal improvement,

00:08:36.086 --> 00:08:40.503
is for the inner improvement as far
as the personal side is concerned

00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:44.003
means your intelligence must improve,

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:46.587
your temperament must improve,

00:08:46.837 --> 00:08:48.754
your heart must clear out,

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.670
your feelings must be all right.

00:08:51.879 --> 00:08:55.503
Then you should, your health should be all right,

00:08:55.754 --> 00:08:58.670
then your relationship with others should be all right,

00:08:58.879 --> 00:09:00.420
your ego should go away,

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:02.337
your superego should go away

00:09:02.503 --> 00:09:04.754
all these things are there.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.920
But this only helps a personality,

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.920
just a personality that is very limited, that is yourself.

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:14.378
But now this personality can become an instrument,

00:09:14.587 --> 00:09:17.503
if you can develop that depth within yourself.

00:09:17.754 --> 00:09:20.253
But normally what happens, people are

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.253
very much still worried about themselves,

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.754
say about their wives, about their children,

00:09:25.919 --> 00:09:32.003
about their husbands or their household, or this and that.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:36.587
These are not important things, because we have to be those

00:09:36.837 --> 00:09:40.919
instruments which are what you call them, like pilotless bombs,

00:09:41.086 --> 00:09:43.670
we have to develop that depth within us.

00:09:43.837 --> 00:09:45.420
That depth is possible,

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:49.920
and you can really cure many problems of your country

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:52.961
if you could just meditate on them.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:57.754
Now for today, I had actually sucked in most of the problems

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.170
which I had felt were there in Canberra

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:07.670
and later on in that conference, and later on here.

00:10:07.961 --> 00:10:12.961
All these problems came into My understanding,

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.462
I would say, and I was trying to work on them.

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:20.837
My working style is different because I have very sharp

00:10:21.003 --> 00:10:23.420
and very effective instruments.

00:10:23.587 --> 00:10:26.503
But I have to pay attention to it

00:10:26.754 --> 00:10:29.253
and I a little bit suffer also, doesn't matter.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:33.337
Now for you also, it is important that you also develop

00:10:33.587 --> 00:10:35.919
those deeper feelings within you,

00:10:36.086 --> 00:10:37.879
deeper sense within you.

00:10:38.045 --> 00:10:41.170
But mostly people are very superficial type.

00:10:41.337 --> 00:10:43.503
They just think about their body,

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:47.503
their impressions, how they carry themselves.

00:10:47.754 --> 00:10:51.837
At the most they'll think we have to be very legal-minded,

00:10:52.003 --> 00:10:58.003
or we have to be at the most not drinking, not smoking,

00:10:58.253 --> 00:11:03.503
and all these things are achieved and we have achieved everything.

00:11:03.754 --> 00:11:06.670
But I think that is not so.

00:11:06.837 --> 00:11:10.919
And second point is that we think that if we love each other,

00:11:11.086 --> 00:11:14.253
if we love Mother, that is the end of everything.

00:11:14.503 --> 00:11:15.837
It's not true also,

00:11:16.003 --> 00:11:20.337
because you see, your love for Me is there no doubt

00:11:20.545 --> 00:11:22.837
and it should be intense, it should be deeper;

00:11:23.003 --> 00:11:24.919
but the deeper you go into that love,

00:11:25.086 --> 00:11:30.670
then you will be surprised how you receive a special quality

00:11:30.837 --> 00:11:34.503
of correcting the things that are wrong around you.

00:11:34.754 --> 00:11:37.503
Gradually that quality improves.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:41.086
For example, a Sahaja yogi goes to anybody's house,

00:11:41.253 --> 00:11:44.754
that house must become auspicious.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.754
But such a Sahaja yogi must have a good heart.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.670
If the heart is not good, in the heart there is still

00:11:52.919 --> 00:11:59.587
anger, passion, lust, greed,

00:11:59.837 --> 00:12:01.503
then such a heart won't affect.

00:12:01.754 --> 00:12:03.837
But a person who has purified himself,

00:12:04.003 --> 00:12:08.920
if he goes into any family, any household, any society,

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:12.837
the whole change will take place.

00:12:13.003 --> 00:12:15.919
The circumstances will change.

00:12:16.086 --> 00:12:19.253
Things that do not work out will start working out immediately.

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.211
Like they said, "Mother, as soon as You

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:24.253
sent from this Sunday, everything started working out

00:12:24.462 --> 00:12:27.295
as far as the television is concerned

00:12:27.503 --> 00:12:29.919
and radio is concerned."

00:12:30.086 --> 00:12:34.003
I didn't do anything -- in a way.

00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:36.420
But that should happen with you also.

00:12:36.587 --> 00:12:41.503
Wherever a saint goes, things are changing.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.587
But you have to be a saint,

00:12:43.795 --> 00:12:49.712
and a saintly person has a very deep understanding

00:12:49.919 --> 00:12:53.712
of another person,

00:12:53.919 --> 00:12:57.754
and this is what it is lacking:

00:12:57.919 --> 00:13:01.961
we don't have that deep understanding for each other.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:07.919
Then even if you have for some of your own friends,

00:13:08.086 --> 00:13:12.420
or maybe in the same ashram that you are staying and all that

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:16.337
but it should deepen much more.

00:13:16.587 --> 00:13:21.670
You should go further and further.

00:13:22.378 --> 00:13:25.795
Now even if you think of Me, it works out.

00:13:25.961 --> 00:13:29.003
It's the other way round also.

00:13:29.253 --> 00:13:34.337
But first of all the meditative process should be increased.

00:13:34.503 --> 00:13:38.128
We all must meditate, that is very important

00:13:38.337 --> 00:13:40.961
meditate sincerely.

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:44.754
Not just because we have to meditate

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:51.045
but because we have to be deep, we have to grow within

00:13:51.253 --> 00:14:00.295
to express our great powers of divine love;

00:14:00.503 --> 00:14:05.170
to correct so many things, which you can do very easily

00:14:05.337 --> 00:14:09.295
I know you all can do it.

00:14:09.503 --> 00:14:12.754
There's no need to have big degrees for that,

00:14:12.919 --> 00:14:16.545
big education for that, nothing is needed.

00:14:16.754 --> 00:14:20.837
What is needed is a deep feeling

00:14:21.003 --> 00:14:27.086
of love for the whole universe, and that changes.

00:14:27.253 --> 00:14:30.754
The all-destructive forces change their course,

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.170
and it is then for the constructive forces.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:43.170
But on the whole that works out much faster if you all

00:14:43.337 --> 00:14:49.170
do that meditation with sincerity, with intensity,

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.503
with understanding. All right?

00:14:52.712 --> 00:14:56.003
May God bless you.

00:15:01.406 --> 00:15:04.531
It is much more than our music,

00:15:04.741 --> 00:15:09.699
much more than My lectures or anything, that we have to do.

00:15:09.945 --> 00:15:11.945
And now the course has to change.

00:15:12.121 --> 00:15:16.037
I am sure you people will take to the new course.

00:15:16.303 --> 00:15:19.887
So may God bless you for that.

00:15:23.187 --> 00:15:25.525
Have you got any questions?

00:15:47.657 --> 00:15:52.469
Yogi: There seems to be some difference of opinion on parts

00:15:52.657 --> 00:15:59.397
of the body that are represented here, and here, and there.
Could You tell us please, Shri Mataji?

00:16:02.746 --> 00:16:04.111
I see.

00:16:07.201 --> 00:16:10.272
These chakras are represented outside also

00:16:10.447 --> 00:16:13.296
in our body, we can say,

00:16:13.434 --> 00:16:17.364
that on our feet as you know:

00:16:22.591 --> 00:16:24.945
you know the Nabhi,

00:16:25.057 --> 00:16:28.572
Nabhi is the thumb* (you be seated and I’ll tell you; you’ll know)

00:16:28.829 --> 00:16:30.710
– Nabhi is the thumb,

00:16:32.504 --> 00:16:35.210
and left and right Nabhi.

00:16:35.605 --> 00:16:41.540
Then second finger from the thumb is the Vishuddhi,

00:16:43.334 --> 00:16:55.587
the third finger is the Swadhishthana,

00:16:57.436 --> 00:17:00.965
the fourth finger is the Agya,

00:17:01.277 --> 00:17:04.740
and the fifth finger is the Heart.

00:17:06.365 --> 00:17:10.619
Now this is the – our basis.

00:17:11.056 --> 00:17:13.903
Then in the hands they change,

00:17:14.308 --> 00:17:19.419
as you know. In the hands you know very well,
I need not tell about the hands.

00:17:19.975 --> 00:17:23.538
Now in your hand,

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:29.536
we can say, this one here is the Lalita Chakra,

00:17:29.746 --> 00:17:32.833
also is the part of the Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:36.268
It works out the Vishuddhi Chakra, Lalita Chakra.

00:17:36.744 --> 00:17:40.865
And then this is the Nabhi

00:17:41.628 --> 00:17:45.430
and this is the Vishuddhi

00:17:48.796 --> 00:17:53.802
Swadhishthana is in between, you can say.

00:17:54.992 --> 00:17:58.540
Now, Heart is here

00:17:58.921 --> 00:18:05.543
so any time you have this finger paining too much,

00:18:05.686 --> 00:18:08.662
then you must know there’s some trouble with the Heart.

00:18:08.785 --> 00:18:11.578
But Heart is not in all these things,

00:18:11.761 --> 00:18:16.723
but sometimes, sometimes it could be felt here

00:18:16.851 --> 00:18:21.874
Heart Chakra can be felt here with
a reflection maybe, on this side.

00:18:22.419 --> 00:18:25.164
So we can do like this, is to say:

00:18:25.475 --> 00:18:30.587
Vishuddhi, Heart, then Nabhi, then Swadhishthana,

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.023
and then … sorry!

00:18:34.563 --> 00:18:39.028
This is the Vishuddhi

00:18:42.486 --> 00:18:44.971
this is Swadhishthana

00:18:45.211 --> 00:18:48.441
this is Heart

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.073
and this is Nabhi

00:18:52.629 --> 00:18:55.350
and this one is

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:06.086
but I never use them, so I just don’t know!

00:19:09.238 --> 00:19:15.095
Heart and this is Vishuddhi. All right?

00:19:16.441 --> 00:19:19.012
But you can feel it sometimes even Heart here

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:23.160
because if Swadhishthana is very active your Heart goes out,

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.747
so you can feel it here.

00:19:24.899 --> 00:19:31.926
It’s a very important thing that
we should have that discrimination,

00:19:32.141 --> 00:19:35.621
because if I tell you something maybe you are

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:39.835
not yet that level of discretion, and you may get confused.

00:19:41.812 --> 00:19:44.588
So this is the Vishuddhi

00:19:45.566 --> 00:19:50.593
Now there is pain here, that means there is problem with your Vishuddhi.

00:19:51.042 --> 00:19:57.195
Now sometimes you have a problem, say, on your Vishuddhi

00:19:57.479 --> 00:20:02.555
– now you can pull this finger. Just to pull the finger nicely,

00:20:03.127 --> 00:20:07.860
and you’ll be surprised, the vibrations
coming out of left Vishuddhi.

00:20:09.248 --> 00:20:13.263
Any one, you have any problem, you can pull them.

00:20:13.711 --> 00:20:18.585
And that is how all the chakras are placed in the body.

00:20:22.388 --> 00:20:27.202
In the same way downward if you move, this is the Nabhi

00:20:27.444 --> 00:20:30.531
this is the Swadhishthana, both are Swadhishthana

00:20:30.889 --> 00:20:38.153
and this is the Heart and

00:20:44.236 --> 00:20:48.744
this is the Vishuddhi at the ankle bone.

00:20:50.457 --> 00:20:53.699
This is Vishuddhi at the ankle bone.

00:20:54.046 --> 00:20:56.958
So the main thing to remember are the Vishuddhis, because

00:20:57.086 --> 00:21:00.030
Vishuddhi, Nabhi and Swadhishthan:

00:21:00.674 --> 00:21:02.333
these three are important,

00:21:02.336 --> 00:21:06.759
because they go off immediately as soon as
– supposing there is a Nabhi patient sitting with you,

00:21:06.878 --> 00:21:09.588
you’ll immediately have a problem on your Nabhi

00:21:09.824 --> 00:21:13.365
But these sometimes manifest, not all the time,

00:21:13.552 --> 00:21:15.607
so they can be confusing.

00:21:15.694 --> 00:21:17.693
But Swadhishthana specially.

00:21:17.901 --> 00:21:22.577
Like, when I got down in Canberra I just couldn’t walk,
both the Swadhishthanas went like that, you see.

00:21:22.712 --> 00:21:24.315
I didn’t know how to move.

00:21:24.419 --> 00:21:27.053
It was terrible because both the Swadhishthanas were caught up

00:21:27.165 --> 00:21:28.974
– for a while, but they were.

00:21:29.101 --> 00:21:32.865
So it is indicative of those things.

00:21:38.517 --> 00:21:42.151
Yogi: Shri Mataji, could You please
tell us more about Hamsa Chakra?

00:21:42.374 --> 00:21:43.842
Hamsa Chakra?

00:21:44.981 --> 00:21:48.362
Hamsa Chakra is placed here

00:21:48.735 --> 00:21:51.362
where some of the nerves

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:55.063
which are coming from Ida and Pingala cross over,

00:21:55.339 --> 00:22:02.255
and is a part of Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:08.341
Plus the connection with Vishuddhi and Agya:

00:22:08.511 --> 00:22:13.075
as you must have read in the Devi Mahatmyam that

00:22:13.218 --> 00:22:17.123
Shri Krishna is the Father of Christ,

00:22:17.584 --> 00:22:21.959
so the connection between the two is maintained here.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.935
And this is very important, Hamsa Chakra is,

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:31.553
that if your Hamsa Chakra is not all right,
your discretion is very poor.

00:22:32.748 --> 00:22:37.079
This chakra will get easily dried out.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.893
Like if you eat very dried food, you see.

00:22:41.076 --> 00:22:49.055
Say, sometimes you also offer Me some dried food,
and I have to tell you that not to give too dry food.

00:22:49.255 --> 00:22:55.923
You must eat it with some sauce or some liquid thing,
because if you eat very dry food

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.150
also this becomes very dry.

00:22:58.807 --> 00:23:00.795
And it’s very important

00:23:00.942 --> 00:23:04.380
because if this portion becomes dry,

00:23:04.493 --> 00:23:09.255
you can put some oil or ghee into it to make it all right.

00:23:09.605 --> 00:23:15.850
But from here starts the drying of the peritoneum and the lining.

00:23:16.747 --> 00:23:19.348
If the peritoneum gets dried up,

00:23:19.385 --> 00:23:21.257
the whole body gets dried up.

00:23:21.385 --> 00:23:24.583
It can be anywhere; in the lung if it is dried up

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:26.912
it can cause you lung cancer.

00:23:27.071 --> 00:23:31.523
As even the peritoneum can be in a cancer state.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.805
So one has to be very careful not to take something very dry,

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:39.956
all the time dry food and dry things.

00:23:40.115 --> 00:23:45.135
Moreover, not to put anything to make this a lubricant

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:51.279
– some sort of a lubricant should be
there so there’s no problem on this chakra.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.954
Because first of all it loses your discretion,

00:23:55.272 --> 00:23:58.917
you don’t understand things,
you don’t know what to do. You mean it,

00:23:59.029 --> 00:24:05.013
you mean good, but you don’t do.
When you achieve something, it’s something not so good.

00:24:05.201 --> 00:24:07.359
The reason is, your discretion is poor.

00:24:07.511 --> 00:24:10.967
For that this must not be made dry.

00:24:16.872 --> 00:24:19.125
I have told many a times to put some

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:23.395
ghee every day. Get a little bottle of ghee,

00:24:24.314 --> 00:24:27.490
keep it with you with a little dropper.

00:24:27.705 --> 00:24:29.526
You can put it in the hot water,

00:24:29.681 --> 00:24:35.762
you can heat it up every day, and take two drops in the nose

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:40.834
in the night and in the morning time.
It doesn’t take much, but it should be done.

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:44.786
It’s for your good.

00:24:47.629 --> 00:24:50.603
That’s the only ritual I think we follow, do we

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.562
– have we any other ritual?

00:24:52.677 --> 00:24:57.274
We don’t even make a cross!

00:25:02.141 --> 00:25:04.438
Anything else?

00:25:05.682 --> 00:25:13.184
Yogi: Shri Mother, last two years ago when You were here
at Burwood, You were saying how we’ve gone beyond nirvichara

00:25:13.319 --> 00:25:21.706
and we’re into savikalpa, and we’re reaching nirvikalpa.
Could You please tell us a little about savikalpa?

00:25:26.798 --> 00:25:31.257
First stage is nirvikalpa where you become thoughtless in between,

00:25:31.433 --> 00:25:34.020
then you become, again come to thought,

00:25:34.197 --> 00:25:35.704
again you become thoughtless.

00:25:35.808 --> 00:25:38.926
That’s a very good stage where you start,

00:25:39.189 --> 00:25:44.089
and you start growing up into that.

00:25:44.447 --> 00:25:47.945
Now savikalp can be before or after this stage,

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.720
like savikalpa is – “vikalpa” means doubt,

00:25:51.954 --> 00:25:54.182
and “savikalpa” means with doubt.

00:25:54.326 --> 00:25:57.079
So you are still growing with the doubts in your mind.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.119
There are people who still grow with doubts in their mind.

00:26:00.328 --> 00:26:04.165
For example you see, somebody feels hurt in Sahaja Yoga,

00:26:04.372 --> 00:26:06.331
some way he’s hurt

00:26:07.728 --> 00:26:12.367
that “I’ve been hurt in Sahaja Yoga”
– something, the subconscious is there.

00:26:12.757 --> 00:26:15.814
Then he still has that feeling within himself, “I’m hurt,

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:19.436
but still I must do Sahaja Yoga, it is good.” Mentally he accepts

00:26:19.555 --> 00:26:24.848
and goes on with it, so he can get into nirvikalp state with that.

00:26:24.957 --> 00:26:27.369
Or maybe he gets to nirvikalpa state

00:26:27.473 --> 00:26:31.676
and then again goes to savikalpa. That’s a flashback.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:36.560
And could be he can say, “All right, I’ll do it in nirvichara,

00:26:36.664 --> 00:26:40.812
but from nirvichara I can go to,

00:26:40.947 --> 00:26:46.999
you see, my doubts also. After all I have my doubts,
what things and this and that is possible.”

00:26:47.111 --> 00:26:50.397
And some people have a hidden anger within themselves,

00:26:50.517 --> 00:26:55.146
or kind of a hidden feelings or hidden things

00:26:55.242 --> 00:27:01.033
which he’s not very aware of, too,
so he has also got the vikalpas with him.

00:27:01.129 --> 00:27:03.874
So with savikalpa samadhi is that,

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:08.497
so it can be after or before nirvichara samadhi.

00:27:08.593 --> 00:27:12.194
So I mean, you go, fall on to it sometime.

00:27:12.677 --> 00:27:15.629
So we’ll have to go beyond actually savikalpa,

00:27:16.353 --> 00:27:19.103
because nirvichar samadhi is not sufficient enough.

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:22.317
All the vikalpas, all the doubts must go away,

00:27:22.508 --> 00:27:25.288
then you’ll reach the state of nirvikalpa.

00:27:25.439 --> 00:27:28.239
Then there’s no doubt, there’s no problem.

00:27:28.526 --> 00:27:31.670
There are many among you who are like that,

00:27:32.074 --> 00:27:34.550
who are not yet aware that they are like that.

00:27:34.694 --> 00:27:40.374
That’s why I’m requesting you to develop
this new dimension in your creative work.

00:27:49.706 --> 00:27:56.656
Yogi: Shri Mataji, how can we sustain
a deep meditation throughout the day?

00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:06.906
I just say, when we reach an hight in meditation,
howe can we sustain it during the whole day.

00:28:07.163 --> 00:28:08.793
How can we say?

00:28:09.245 --> 00:28:16.131
Other Yogi: How can we sustain that meditation trought out
of the day. Sustaining the meditation that we had in the morning.

00:28:17.848 --> 00:28:21.142
You see, you are in meditation in a way.

00:28:21.476 --> 00:28:24.888
You are halfway in meditation and halfway not.

00:28:25.133 --> 00:28:29.180
Now if you try to develop a state of witness,

00:28:29.656 --> 00:28:31.802
then you are in meditation

00:28:32.049 --> 00:28:35.239
– just a state of witness. Whatever you see, just watch it.

00:28:35.463 --> 00:28:37.073
Just watching is the best way,

00:28:37.198 --> 00:28:42.937
and then you’ll be surprised that you will find that
you are in another world, these people are only in another world.

00:28:43.054 --> 00:28:44.698
You are seeing them from another world.

00:28:44.841 --> 00:28:46.872
Then you will have compassion for them,

00:28:47.048 --> 00:28:49.024
you will have pity for them,

00:28:49.151 --> 00:28:51.820
you may also not like them –

00:28:52.007 --> 00:28:57.229
it’s all these feelings will come up to you,
but you’ll be a person who is separated from them.

00:29:08.169 --> 00:29:10.608
[Yogi: Sometimes...

00:29:11.116 --> 00:29:15.859
you can feel that you in yourself,
in your center you are all right,

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:22.588
but you move in circumstances
that cause a disharmony in some other part of you.]

00:29:24.323 --> 00:29:26.481
That is the savikalpa state.

00:29:26.825 --> 00:29:28.658
That is you move, you see,

00:29:28.821 --> 00:29:31.406
though you are in that state of

00:29:32.828 --> 00:29:36.272
nirvichara, still you move to savikalpa state

00:29:36.394 --> 00:29:40.506
where you again get vikalpa. But you are, you are after all

00:29:40.608 --> 00:29:43.576
a realized soul, you see. So they have made three

00:29:43.726 --> 00:29:47.298
clear-cut things, that you can have savikalpa samadhi,

00:29:47.806 --> 00:29:51.353
you can have nirvichara samadhi and you can have

00:29:51.433 --> 00:29:53.046
pure nirvikalpa samadhi.

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:56.312
Now from even that state, you see,

00:29:56.386 --> 00:29:58.847
you can get to that,

00:29:58.996 --> 00:30:01.009
and that’s what you have to cut out –

00:30:01.223 --> 00:30:04.128
is to, when you see such a situation

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:09.309
where you get involved, then you say, “This is not, this is not,”

00:30:09.742 --> 00:30:11.035
and come out of it.

00:30:11.419 --> 00:30:14.260
It’s a practice, a little practice can tell you.

00:30:14.665 --> 00:30:18.486
Like driving, by practice you master it in the same way.

00:30:21.566 --> 00:30:25.248
When I know something is wrong, I know it is wrong

00:30:25.292 --> 00:30:28.827
and I know that they are doing wrong, but I just keep quiet

00:30:28.857 --> 00:30:32.657
and then they know what it was wrong and what was right.

00:30:43.429 --> 00:30:48.760
It is better to make others learn by mistakes than to tell them.

00:30:49.084 --> 00:30:51.251
No one likes to be told.

00:30:51.564 --> 00:30:57.268
Then they learn themselves by mistakes,
“Yes, I’ve done this mistake, that mistakes. I’ve ruined my life.

00:30:57.333 --> 00:30:58.333
Now come along."

00:30:58.873 --> 00:31:05.525
But if you tell them, they can be very
reluctant or could be vindictive also.

00:31:20.756 --> 00:31:25.050
[Yogi: Shri Mataji, could You tell us
some more about the conscious mind?]

00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:27.875
Shri Mataji: About? – Yogi: the conscious mind.

00:31:28.405 --> 00:31:30.008
The conscious mind?
Yogi: Yes.

00:31:36.263 --> 00:31:41.418
What do you want to know about the conscious mind?

00:31:41.709 --> 00:31:45.446
You see, conscious mind is the mind where you are awake

00:31:45.914 --> 00:31:48.203
and see things.

00:31:48.573 --> 00:31:51.493
But there is also unconscious mind behind it;

00:31:51.958 --> 00:31:55.918
and there’s a subconscious mind, and there’s supraconscious mind,

00:31:56.591 --> 00:31:58.849
and beyond the supraconscious

00:31:59.083 --> 00:32:01.953
there is also collective supraconscious,

00:32:02.344 --> 00:32:06.964
and beyond the subconscious there is collective subconscious.

00:32:07.149 --> 00:32:09.083
There’s unconscious mind.

00:32:09.181 --> 00:32:13.750
The unconscious mind is in a way, we can say is the Kundalini.

00:32:15.186 --> 00:32:21.543
Now when She enters into your
conscious mind, you become enlightened.

00:32:23.011 --> 00:32:27.165
The conscious mind is the mind that is aware

00:32:27.242 --> 00:32:32.650
of the surroundings, aware of
everyone being there, aware of all the things.

00:32:33.114 --> 00:32:36.804
But an enlightened conscious mind which is of a high level

00:32:36.959 --> 00:32:40.187
is much more conscious of things than you are.

00:32:40.296 --> 00:32:45.701
For example, I am quite conscious
of people who are catching on the Heart,

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:50.028
and I’m quite conscious of the people who are not yet there.

00:32:50.235 --> 00:32:54.687
I’m quite conscious of the people who are perfectly there,

00:32:54.948 --> 00:32:58.631
and I’m quite conscious of the people who are nowhere near.

00:32:58.801 --> 00:33:04.833
But it’s all right for Me, because I with My
conscious mind can raise them up.

00:33:05.033 --> 00:33:07.366
So it’s a different situation with Me.

00:33:07.422 --> 00:33:12.601
But with other people could be
that your conscious mind is all the time,

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:18.523
depending on your level of advancement,
maybe worried about small, small things.

00:33:18.648 --> 00:33:20.826
Like ...

00:33:21.687 --> 00:33:27.468
“I have to go home now and it’s getting late,
and will I get a bus or not?” Could be like that.

00:33:27.714 --> 00:33:32.041
Then there could be another conscious mind which is thinking about

00:33:32.168 --> 00:33:37.088
how far I can meditate,
how far I can go with it, all kinds of things.

00:33:37.345 --> 00:33:42.221
But there could be a conscious mind
which is enlightened, if it is enlightened, it’s just

00:33:43.568 --> 00:33:46.665
just getting all the

00:33:47.247 --> 00:33:49.676
essence of what I am saying,

00:33:50.152 --> 00:33:52.500
and developing and nourishing itself.

00:33:52.921 --> 00:33:56.402
So when you are enlightened, the conscious mind

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:58.731
is something like a

00:33:59.264 --> 00:34:01.981
tree into which the sap is now flowing.

00:34:02.124 --> 00:34:05.565
It may be that it is just like a leaf

00:34:05.872 --> 00:34:10.582
or it may be it is like a flower, or maybe it is like a fruit.

00:34:11.227 --> 00:34:15.566
So it changes its forms once he gets realization.

00:34:15.858 --> 00:34:21.179
If a person gets realization then
the conscious mind moves on, getting more and more light.

00:34:21.222 --> 00:34:23.554
Say for example when the electricity comes

00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:27.330
you can see this room, you can see
another’s room, you can see another room,

00:34:27.553 --> 00:34:33.061
you can go round and see and again, again you will see
it all the rooms, then you become aware of all the rooms

00:34:33.271 --> 00:34:35.286
So you are conscious of all these.

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:39.169
But in the beginning you are just
conscious of the room where you are standing.

00:34:39.333 --> 00:34:40.359
Isn’t it?

00:34:40.484 --> 00:34:42.399
So the conscious mind’s

00:34:42.577 --> 00:34:45.256
definition cannot be given after realization.

00:34:45.458 --> 00:34:51.754
A person like Me, say for example, has a
conscious mind that might envelop the whole world.

00:34:51.942 --> 00:34:55.045
Or a conscious mind of a person who is realized soul

00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:58.022
who is still not anywhere, just started,

00:34:58.239 --> 00:35:03.850
then he’s only conscious as to
where is right, where is left, where is this.

00:35:06.259 --> 00:35:10.784
So before the realization
the conscious mind sees things around.

00:35:10.977 --> 00:35:13.413
Out of that also there are categories.

00:35:13.518 --> 00:35:16.160
Some people see, say, for artists can see something,

00:35:16.464 --> 00:35:19.290
and a scientist can see something,

00:35:19.502 --> 00:35:22.121
another poet will see something,

00:35:22.328 --> 00:35:25.296
so it depends on the conscious mind how it is,

00:35:25.539 --> 00:35:27.681
has got the trend. But

00:35:28.278 --> 00:35:32.803
still it won’t see something that is subtle behind it.

00:35:33.199 --> 00:35:37.156
And that only is possible after you get your realization.

00:35:37.792 --> 00:35:38.887
All right?

00:35:42.972 --> 00:35:48.805
Yogi: Mother, sometimes ego masquerades as guru.

00:35:50.368 --> 00:35:53.933
How can we tell when that’s going on in us?

00:35:56.923 --> 00:36:00.829
You see, when ego comes up

00:36:01.594 --> 00:36:07.435
– I don’t know much about it, you see, because I haven’t got!

00:36:11.365 --> 00:36:14.414
We can say when ego comes up,

00:36:14.637 --> 00:36:18.589
then a person becomes arbitrary.
First thing is he becomes arbitrary.

00:36:19.019 --> 00:36:23.394
It start, He’ll start deciding, “I’ll have this, I’ll have that,

00:36:23.562 --> 00:36:27.449
I like this” – you see? This is the one thing.

00:36:27.659 --> 00:36:32.151
Secondly it takes out itself from the collective,

00:36:32.516 --> 00:36:36.601
becomes very arbitrary, collective removes itself from you.

00:36:37.161 --> 00:36:39.668
But the spirit is the other way round.

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:43.106
Spirit is, it cares for the collective.

00:36:43.806 --> 00:36:46.392
It doesn’t become arbitrary at all

00:36:46.535 --> 00:36:51.376
and it never says “I like, I want.” Its “I” drops out.

00:36:51.779 --> 00:36:55.862
You see, you can easily see, very easily with your discrimination

00:36:56.068 --> 00:36:59.013
that egoistical person

00:36:59.235 --> 00:37:02.787
is not even liked by the person who has ego.

00:37:03.552 --> 00:37:09.887
If he sees himself in the mirror he says,
“Oh God, what’s this wretched nonsense? What a temperament it is!”

00:37:10.116 --> 00:37:12.044
It will not like itself.

00:37:12.947 --> 00:37:17.344
There was a lady who was a very hot-tempered woman

00:37:17.646 --> 00:37:22.258
and once she came to My puja,
and I said, “Now what is this heater you have brought before Me

00:37:22.351 --> 00:37:26.528
in India in the hot season" – one heater put before you.

00:37:26.764 --> 00:37:30.504
I said, “Oh God, please remove her, she’s like a heater.”

00:37:30.834 --> 00:37:32.639
Nobody understood it, you see,

00:37:32.794 --> 00:37:37.868
but I said, “Please remove her.”
So then they asked her, “You get down. Mother can’t bear you.”

00:37:38.388 --> 00:37:43.805
Then she was very angry,“What is this?
What’s wrong with me? What have I done?”

00:37:44.593 --> 00:37:46.133
After some time, you see,

00:37:46.251 --> 00:37:51.901
people said that “we have nothing to do.”
Then nobody would talk to her, she was left alone,

00:37:52.222 --> 00:37:57.367
and then she was also very unhappy about it because
she was left alone. She thought, “What’s this? This is insulting.

00:37:57.415 --> 00:37:59.304
Why should they leave me alone?”

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:01.332
Then after some time

00:38:01.459 --> 00:38:05.846
she realized that “There must be something wrong with me,

00:38:06.193 --> 00:38:10.693
I must find out. There’s something
nonsensical about it, something filthy on me.

00:38:10.851 --> 00:38:12.215
I should throw it away.”

00:38:12.682 --> 00:38:18.844
Then she started working it out and seeing
herself and all that, and she became a very, very sweet person.

00:38:19.137 --> 00:38:22.237
But she dare not face Me, was quite afraid.

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:26.740
So her daughter came to see Me one day.
I said, “How is your mother?”

00:38:26.788 --> 00:38:30.436
She said, “Mother, she’s all right.”
“You ask her to come and see Me.”

00:38:30.919 --> 00:38:33.580
So she said, “And I have never felt such joy

00:38:33.659 --> 00:38:38.005
as I felt that day when You called me.”
I said, “I knew you have improved so much.”

00:38:38.108 --> 00:38:40.039
She came. I had taken a watch for her.

00:38:40.133 --> 00:38:43.893
She said, “Mother, You have brought a watch for me?”
I said, “Yes, I have brought a watch for you.”

00:38:43.939 --> 00:38:48.651
She said, “Thank God that filth is gone, thank God! Fed up of it!”

00:38:48.987 --> 00:38:53.956
That’s how when you develop, then
that sweetness, the beauty, everything comes up.

00:38:54.617 --> 00:38:56.662
But you see the ego is,

00:38:56.852 --> 00:39:01.158
if you play upon your ego it adheres to you.

00:39:01.424 --> 00:39:05.209
You get identified with it, and you cannot get rid of it.

00:39:05.373 --> 00:39:08.477
But I have seen one case which is such a beautiful case is,

00:39:08.695 --> 00:39:15.072
and I was sitting in My room and I could feel with the
child when she came in. And I asked her, “Where is your mother?”

00:39:15.262 --> 00:39:20.024
She was herself surprised. When she told her mother.
She said, “I’ve never had such a joy!

00:39:20.419 --> 00:39:21.878
Such a joy I had

00:39:22.156 --> 00:39:27.023
that, oh, Mother has recognized me.”
I said, “I always recognized you.”

00:39:28.245 --> 00:39:30.704
So this is what it is.

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:54.722
Yogini: The Sahastrara is represented by the lotus...

00:39:55.635 --> 00:40:01.409
What she said?
Yogi: You have to speek up. Stand up.
Shri Mataji: Please.

00:40:01.568 --> 00:40:06.245
Yogini: The Sahastrara is represented by the lotus flower.

00:40:06.554 --> 00:40:12.979
Yogi repeats: The Sahastrara is represented by the lotus flower

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:23.996
Yogini: At the moment, if the lotus flower,
starting to lose its petals and the fruit developed?

00:40:28.569 --> 00:40:32.509
Yogi: The Sahastrara is represented by the lotus,

00:40:32.714 --> 00:40:37.359
and is the lotus at the moment...is the lotus loosing its petals?

00:40:37.565 --> 00:40:39.890
And the fruit developing.

00:40:42.011 --> 00:40:48.179
You see, it is represented as lotus
because our brain is like a lotus, actually.

00:40:48.569 --> 00:40:51.557
If you cut it horizontally you can see

00:40:51.677 --> 00:40:55.349
as if you have cut the petals,

00:40:55.745 --> 00:40:59.209
and if you cut it vertically

00:40:59.448 --> 00:41:02.236
you can see that around the

00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:07.134
around the limbic area it is just like petals of lotus

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:12.291
But when you are enlightened
what happens, they swell up and they open out,

00:41:12.482 --> 00:41:14.974
and they all have beautiful colors.

00:41:15.101 --> 00:41:18.442
They look like tongues of flames, it’s very beautiful.

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.363
Now the Sahastrara is open

00:41:21.634 --> 00:41:23.791
and the lotus is open,

00:41:23.911 --> 00:41:28.250
and inside you find the fruit already there kept,

00:41:28.432 --> 00:41:31.820
which is the Agya Chakra, which sits there.

00:41:32.164 --> 00:41:36.505
You can see it very clearly. Agnya is yellow,

00:41:37.602 --> 00:41:41.130
yellow-covered as we say,

00:41:41.209 --> 00:41:44.666
like a gold cap

00:41:44.791 --> 00:41:48.250
is the Agnya there, beautiful Agnya is inside.

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:54.253
Now the fruit of the lotus

00:41:54.975 --> 00:41:57.989
is later on we see,

00:41:58.434 --> 00:42:04.741
and I would say that is called
as Bindu state, where you become a bindu

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:09.090
– a dot, it’s a little dot

00:42:09.387 --> 00:42:11.672
– and that dot has to then grow.

00:42:12.124 --> 00:42:14.552
So it’s the second stage starts

00:42:14.589 --> 00:42:17.597
when you become the fruit of the lotus.

00:42:26.475 --> 00:42:32.114
Yogi: Shri Mother, could You say something
about these higher chakras above the Sahasrara?

00:42:32.415 --> 00:42:33.959
Shri Mataji: What chakra?

00:42:34.269 --> 00:42:42.901
Yogi: I heard people talk about Bindu and
Adi Bindu and the higher chakras above that?

00:42:43.611 --> 00:42:46.912
You see, I don’t think you should worry too much about these.

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:52.758
These three stages higher than Sahastrara.

00:42:53.885 --> 00:42:56.184
I would suggest just now

00:42:56.311 --> 00:42:59.790
let us concentrate on Sahastrara, is a better idea.

00:43:00.464 --> 00:43:04.537
But Bindu, Ardha-Bindu and Valaya are the three stages

00:43:04.609 --> 00:43:07.459
in which one has to pass through later on,

00:43:07.838 --> 00:43:10.395
and you would pass gradually

00:43:10.647 --> 00:43:13.155
when you develop yourself horizontally.

00:43:13.329 --> 00:43:15.329
That’s what we have started now,

00:43:15.464 --> 00:43:20.248
so let us keep to this idea that
we have to develop ourself horizontally.

00:43:20.628 --> 00:43:23.744
We should see how we affect

00:43:24.615 --> 00:43:26.927
the other person,

00:43:27.047 --> 00:43:29.999
how we influence the another person.

00:43:30.119 --> 00:43:34.701
For example some people, you see,
they are very egoistical and all that,

00:43:34.852 --> 00:43:40.669
they may come in contact with you
and say, “Oh, very nice person, charming person, this, that.”

00:43:40.878 --> 00:43:46.226
But actually that person is just
very physically may be attractive, or

00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:52.504
or may be a little brilliant type of person but doesn’t have anything much in it.

00:43:52.631 --> 00:43:56.399
But if that person standing next to you, changes

00:43:56.665 --> 00:43:59.217
the mood and temperament of another person,

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:03.798
then you can say that this person has a spiritual personality.

00:44:04.385 --> 00:44:07.008
So let us see how you affect the nature.

00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:08.554
Flowers

00:44:08.704 --> 00:44:13.099
– you saw the miracle of the flowers
that I performed for you  the other day.

00:44:13.603 --> 00:44:15.174
In the same way

00:44:15.246 --> 00:44:19.430
let us see what is the effect of your character on the

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:23.602
on the trees, on your friends,

00:44:23.702 --> 00:44:26.057
or in the food that you make – everything

00:44:26.114 --> 00:44:28.122
everything changes, it’s very beautiful.

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:31.206
So we have to see that, how it works out.

00:44:31.318 --> 00:44:36.246
I have known people who have never known
what is poetry is, suddenly they become poets.

00:44:36.514 --> 00:44:39.456
Some who were never musicians started singing so well.

00:44:39.583 --> 00:44:41.321
Like Christine, you know Christine,

00:44:41.411 --> 00:44:44.086
she never used to sing, she had a horrible voice.

00:44:44.308 --> 00:44:48.764
And suddenly she started singing like a cuckoo-bird!

00:44:51.858 --> 00:44:57.213
So not only you, but on others
what effect is had? What others feel about you?

00:44:57.384 --> 00:44:59.200
You see, how you are kind,

00:44:59.293 --> 00:45:03.861
good and sweet to others, not superficially,

00:45:04.042 --> 00:45:07.658
but your behavior should change another person,

00:45:08.103 --> 00:45:10.034
transform another person.

00:45:10.095 --> 00:45:14.402
Your presence should bring auspiciousness.

00:45:36.124 --> 00:45:47.229
[Yogi: Shri Mataji, how can we develop
that same heart that poets like Kabir have for You?]

00:45:47.565 --> 00:45:51.623
Shri Mataji: Same heart as what? - Yogi: Kabir, like Kabir.

00:45:52.725 --> 00:45:54.011
Why not?

00:45:56.197 --> 00:45:58.661
See the handicap of Kabir.

00:45:59.581 --> 00:46:01.581
You have no handicaps.

00:46:02.159 --> 00:46:06.073
Kabir had no Mother to tell him, no Mother to love him,

00:46:06.278 --> 00:46:09.270
look after him and tell him all these things.

00:46:10.015 --> 00:46:13.548
He had a guru, if you know Kabir’s life.

00:46:13.801 --> 00:46:21.431
Kabir wanted to become the disciple of Ramananda Swami,

00:46:21.779 --> 00:46:25.692
but he was a Muslim or low-caste or whatever it is,

00:46:26.081 --> 00:46:29.521
so he could not  reach Ramanand Swami.

00:46:29.662 --> 00:46:33.914
The disciples would not allow him to go near Ramanand Swami.

00:46:34.143 --> 00:46:42.212
So one day Kabira went and slept on the

00:46:43.151 --> 00:46:48.943
steps of the River Ganges, all night in the cold

00:46:49.097 --> 00:46:52.108
waiting for Ramanand Swami to come,

00:46:52.299 --> 00:46:55.351
because he used to always pass the same way.

00:46:55.637 --> 00:47:00.237
And his feet fell on Kabira

00:47:00.628 --> 00:47:04.453
and he said, “Oh my child, what are you doing here?”

00:47:04.875 --> 00:47:10.590
So Kabira got up and he said, “Sir,
you have accepted me as your disciple today.”

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:12.162
He said, “Yes, I have.”

00:47:12.237 --> 00:47:16.173
And then Ramanand Swami took him and he

00:47:16.296 --> 00:47:18.414
trained him into something great.

00:47:18.598 --> 00:47:21.184
You don’t have these handicaps,

00:47:21.584 --> 00:47:26.175
where Kabira never had anybody to support him or help him around.

00:47:26.361 --> 00:47:29.709
Actually single-handed he fought the whole world.

00:47:31.279 --> 00:47:35.950
Horrible people were around him; even today those who are

00:47:36.632 --> 00:47:42.064
in his place in Patna on all places where he lived

00:47:42.233 --> 00:47:46.600
– I was self surprised that he described Kundalini as “surathi”

00:47:46.745 --> 00:47:49.140
and they described tobacco as “surathi.”

00:47:49.282 --> 00:47:53.346
Such horrible nonsensical people, making fun of everything.

00:47:53.806 --> 00:47:56.738
There Kabira lived and developed that heart.

00:47:56.837 --> 00:48:00.543
You don’t have all these handicaps, at all.

00:48:00.872 --> 00:48:05.342
You all speak the same language, you live with the same ideas,

00:48:05.507 --> 00:48:09.065
you have your own Mother to tell you everything,

00:48:09.168 --> 00:48:14.097
so you can develop the same heart as Kabira had.

00:48:17.344 --> 00:48:26.539
Yogi: Mother, when I meditate sometimes I can see beautiful,

00:48:26.936 --> 00:48:38.968
like a massive flower coming out of the head or a beautiful,
sort of a golden like, almost like a vase.

00:48:39.252 --> 00:48:49.059
And I’ve been asking people, and they don’t know
really the answer, and I don’t know it either.

00:48:49.382 --> 00:48:52.374
That’s the Kundalini that you see.

00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:54.566
It is like a telescope, you see

00:48:54.765 --> 00:49:02.774
like a goldenish, yellowish sort of a, like a heated, like iron...

00:49:02.972 --> 00:49:04.473
Yogi: It’s like a furnace.

00:49:04.679 --> 00:49:07.775
Yes, furnace, it’s like a furnace. That’s the Kundalini you see,

00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:11.251
and that’s a good thing to see. But when you see you are not there,

00:49:11.424 --> 00:49:16.606
so it’s better is not to see that. But what you see is that,

00:49:16.726 --> 00:49:19.794
is the Kundalini. It’s good, I mean seeing is very good,

00:49:19.936 --> 00:49:24.511
but to go beyond it. Say,
“No, I don’t want to see it. Now I want to enter into it.”

00:49:24.707 --> 00:49:30.489
Yogi: Yes. Last night for instance
I was sleeping with my little girl,

00:49:30.656 --> 00:49:38.857
and in her bed she asked me to come. And we meditated,
and it was enormous and I woke up, suddenly woke up.

00:49:39.102 --> 00:49:40.618
In your dream you saw?

00:49:40.804 --> 00:49:44.710
Yogi: I don’t know whether it was a dream or
whether I was still meditating, but ….

00:49:44.885 --> 00:49:46.734
In dream if you see is very good,

00:49:46.877 --> 00:49:51.498
but otherwise in meditation you should not see it.
In the dream if you see, is very good.

00:49:51.689 --> 00:49:56.520
It’s the Kundalini itself, it’s like a furnace,
it looks like a silent burning furnace.

00:49:56.650 --> 00:50:00.204
Yogi: Sometimes like fireworks. It’s quite beautiful.

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:07.168
Yes. But you shouldn’t see it
anymore, all right? Try to avoid.

00:50:08.999 --> 00:50:13.610
Yogi: Shri Mataji, could You just say
something about how we pure attention?

00:50:13.832 --> 00:50:17.835
Shri Mataji: Pure?
Yogi: Pure attention, how we purify the attention.

00:50:17.995 --> 00:50:22.787
How we look beyond the human form
and the differences between each other?

00:50:22.947 --> 00:50:25.387
Pure attention?

00:50:26.457 --> 00:50:32.781
You see, your attention gets spoilt
that when you put attention – say I put attention onto this glass,

00:50:32.845 --> 00:50:37.285
then I start thinking about this glass that
“Oh, it’s a beautiful glass so now,

00:50:37.476 --> 00:50:40.126
so it’s a very beautifully done one.

00:50:40.337 --> 00:50:44.487
Now somehow or other I should manage to steal it!”

00:50:57.535 --> 00:51:04.871
Then attention moves further, “How can I manage to steal this?

00:51:05.917 --> 00:51:09.642
And what should I do, what is the best way of stealing it?”

00:51:09.784 --> 00:51:15.875
and all those things. So the attention gives,
you see, into problems and problems because I have got

00:51:16.057 --> 00:51:19.559
for this a greed, I develop a greed.

00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:23.930
How I’ve developed? Because you see, supposing

00:51:24.555 --> 00:51:29.714
I put My attention to it and then a thought
starts from there coming to Me,

00:51:29.817 --> 00:51:32.949
a reaction as such, this gives you a reaction.

00:51:33.108 --> 00:51:35.966
Then you start seeing a beautiful Ganesha there,

00:51:36.038 --> 00:51:38.688
then you say, “Oh, I have never seen one like this!”

00:51:38.783 --> 00:51:41.691
Like that the thought starts, you see,coming from all this.

00:51:41.798 --> 00:51:44.369
And that thought comes into My mind

00:51:44.418 --> 00:51:47.978
and gives Me ideas that I should do something like that,

00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:49.973
to steal the glass. All right?

00:51:50.113 --> 00:51:55.113
Now, the pure attention would be
that I just watch this without thinking.

00:51:56.446 --> 00:52:01.152
Anywhere that your attention goes and you start sort of

00:52:01.552 --> 00:52:06.321
getting involved into it or getting attached to it,

00:52:06.477 --> 00:52:11.286
you should try to just watch it without thinking.

00:52:11.556 --> 00:52:14.703
Go into thoughtless awareness, then you enjoy it the most.

00:52:14.826 --> 00:52:18.616
Now say for example, these carpets are very nice.

00:52:18.973 --> 00:52:24.009
One thing would be, if they belonged to Me
I would be worried how to insure them

00:52:24.092 --> 00:52:29.257
all these people aresitting, that would be spoilt, this, hat –
all these thoughts will come into My head.

00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:33.850
Supposing these belonged to you, then I’ll think how to manage to

00:52:34.253 --> 00:52:38.328
take them with Me somehow,

00:52:44.443 --> 00:52:51.803
and how to suggest in a very clever way
something that I can manage to take them away!

00:52:53.407 --> 00:52:58.018
Now that is quite human and one can do that way,

00:52:58.126 --> 00:53:03.269
but beyond that all cleverness and cunning,

00:53:03.996 --> 00:53:06.082
best is to appreciate.

00:53:06.257 --> 00:53:09.981
How? By just looking at it without any thought.

00:53:10.337 --> 00:53:15.854
Artist has created it, he has put all
his joy into it. I’m just enjoying the joy,

00:53:16.291 --> 00:53:17.666
just looking at it.

00:53:17.791 --> 00:53:24.802
So when you start enjoying the joy
your attention will become pure, very pure.

00:53:25.209 --> 00:53:28.949
Because the enjoyment of it is, this makes you

00:53:29.037 --> 00:53:34.041
a very sort of a dedicated person about it,

00:53:34.244 --> 00:53:37.829
because you feel that what is in this world after all?

00:53:38.143 --> 00:53:43.627
It’s to enjoy. And if I have to enjoy
everything, then why should I worry

00:53:43.811 --> 00:53:52.677
about getting it to Myself or stealing it,
or doing all these tricks? Better is to enjoy.

00:53:54.022 --> 00:54:00.299
So the reward of it is so great
that attention starts purifying itself.

00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:06.618
[Yogi: We tend to sort of react to
things before we even know that we’ve reacted.

00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:11.016
It seems to be such a fast process
that we look and we react in seconds.]

00:54:11.601 --> 00:54:17.418
Yes, in the beginning it is,
because you are coming from that, you see, style

00:54:17.606 --> 00:54:22.811
to the other style.
But once you settle in this style, then you’ll just react

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:25.889
in this manner that you’ll just watch.

00:54:26.295 --> 00:54:29.477
But it otherwise also works out. I’ll tell you a story.

00:54:29.871 --> 00:54:36.662
They had given Me about sixteen
beautiful crowns – of course I couldn’t wear them

00:54:36.845 --> 00:54:42.320
– for this Krishna Puja in Switzerland, and

00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:47.810
all the English were bringing them, “smuggling” them into England,

00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:51.102
and all these boxes were kept.

00:54:51.467 --> 00:54:53.491
So when they reached the custom

00:54:53.583 --> 00:54:58.659
post, the custom post asked them,
“What are all these?” They said, “All right, you can have a look."

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:00.967
So they passed on one to them.

00:55:01.119 --> 00:55:05.194
So the first fellow looked at it and then he passed to another one,

00:55:05.318 --> 00:55:11.636
then another one given. Like that
four were passed on to them, and they were all looking at it.

00:55:11.887 --> 00:55:16.865
And then they said, “Now what do you say?”
Nothing. They closed it and gave it to them.

00:55:18.048 --> 00:55:23.796
Then they looked back – these boys,
what has happened to them where they were?

00:55:24.026 --> 00:55:27.430
They just were moving like this.

00:55:27.662 --> 00:55:32.431
And so many cars passed but these people
never looked at any cars, they were just ….

00:55:33.146 --> 00:55:36.994
So they had a bliss casualty

00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:48.418
– also this can happen, bliss casualty!

00:55:55.364 --> 00:56:00.447
So better to see things which can cause bliss casualty!

00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:06.944
And once you get into that habit,
then you don’t take to other useless things.

00:56:07.362 --> 00:56:11.941
Then you like to see only things which can give you bliss.

00:56:12.627 --> 00:56:14.730
Your attention changes.

00:56:18.198 --> 00:56:21.650
Yogi: Mother, please, what is the Aumkara?

00:56:22.078 --> 00:56:23.552
The Aumkara?

00:56:23.894 --> 00:56:25.703
Is the first sound.

00:56:26.616 --> 00:56:35.168
When the Shakti departed from Sadashiva,

00:56:35.612 --> 00:56:39.608
from the God Almighty – His Power, His Desire

00:56:39.867 --> 00:56:42.343
departed – it made the first sound:

00:56:42.566 --> 00:56:45.828
that’s the first Child, we say, of God.

00:56:46.541 --> 00:56:49.541
That’s Aumkara. A-U-M is the thing,

00:56:49.890 --> 00:56:54.940
and these are the three Powers which are represented

00:56:56.646 --> 00:57:00.288
as Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati.

00:57:00.690 --> 00:57:07.611
And also all these are combined together to form Shri Ganesh.

00:57:12.927 --> 00:57:15.784
Yogi: Mother, what is Your vision for Sahaja Yoga?

00:57:15.991 --> 00:57:22.139
Shri Mataji: What is the…?
Yogi: What is Your vision for Sahaja Yoga?

00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:29.271
This is the one, started already!

00:57:30.602 --> 00:57:34.752
My vision for Sahaja Yoga is that, that

00:57:35.952 --> 00:57:39.288
all the good people, righteous people,

00:57:40.348 --> 00:57:42.507
God-loving people

00:57:42.895 --> 00:57:48.959
will rise above all that is useless, worldly,

00:57:49.814 --> 00:57:54.048
and reside in the Heavens

00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:59.900
with all the blessings of God, for ever and ever.

00:58:08.095 --> 00:58:09.095
All right?

00:58:09.611 --> 00:58:14.301
So we can have a music,
because without that you won’t feel it is complete.

00:58:16.631 --> 00:58:19.901
Let’s hear the song …

00:58:28.530 --> 00:58:33.347
Did you hear the tape from Pune children?

00:58:33.773 --> 00:58:37.272
Wasn’t it fine? Very good, isn’t it?

00:58:37.943 --> 00:58:41.622
You have to make copies of that and send it over.

00:58:41.888 --> 00:58:47.066
It’s very good music and very good songs …
Yogi: Queen of Sahasrara...

00:58:50.942 --> 00:58:54.799
Such small girls they are, you see, all of them.

00:58:55.019 --> 00:58:58.078
They have made and composed everything done,

00:58:58.343 --> 00:59:03.682
and sang so clearly. It’s really remarkable.
Nobody has taught them anything.
