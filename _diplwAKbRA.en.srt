00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:03,959
Shivaratri Puja, Pune,
17 March 2002.

2
00:02:07,482 --> 00:02:16,649
Tonight we have gathered here to do Shri Shiva Puja.

3
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:35,731
Those people who have a clean heart can only do Shiva Puja.

4
00:02:37,232 --> 00:02:44,898
Those whose heart is not clean cannot do Shiva Puja.

5
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:51,856
It's a simple principle of Shri Shivaratri.

6
00:03:03,773 --> 00:03:08,856
As you have seen yesterday, we have snakes,

7
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:14,482
or, these are horrible snakes

8
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:23,981
guiding behind the Shiva Linga.

9
00:03:25,815 --> 00:03:33,315
The significance is this - those who are clean in heart,

10
00:03:37,731 --> 00:03:40,981
who are full of love for others,

11
00:03:43,981 --> 00:03:53,815
are always guarded by the power of Shiva,

12
00:03:54,065 --> 00:03:56,731
which are the snakes.

13
00:03:57,981 --> 00:04:04,731
It's a symbolic thing, to say, very symbolic.

14
00:04:05,731 --> 00:04:10,065
But I must say that animals understand

15
00:04:10,731 --> 00:04:16,898
Divine force much better than human beings, much better.

16
00:04:18,315 --> 00:04:21,315
Because they have a clean heart.

17
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:31,565
Whatever is their lifestyle built by nature,

18
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:33,565
they carry on with it.

19
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:39,856
But there's no malice, there's no jealousy,

20
00:04:39,898 --> 00:04:44,898
there's not all these mean things in their heart.

21
00:04:45,357 --> 00:04:48,357
They do it because it is supposed to be.

22
00:04:50,731 --> 00:04:55,981
But the quality of human beings is only one

23
00:04:57,065 --> 00:05:02,357
- and that is how much they love and forgive.

24
00:05:04,731 --> 00:05:10,190
Loving capacity of human beings are such by

25
00:05:10,565 --> 00:05:14,731
which they conquer all their negative forces -

26
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:19,190
they can, easily, see that it's not good

27
00:05:19,731 --> 00:05:22,357
to have all these qualities,

28
00:05:22,731 --> 00:05:26,981
or maybe that they understand it's not noble

29
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:32,731
to indulge into all these inhuman behaviour.

30
00:05:35,815 --> 00:05:42,357
They are not bound to indulge into all these things.

31
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:51,731
Neither they are asked to be,

32
00:05:53,815 --> 00:06:02,649
but suddenly they get lured by such things which has got hatred,

33
00:06:02,981 --> 00:06:10,981
jealously and greed.

34
00:06:14,357 --> 00:06:16,815
You see how Shiva lives.

35
00:06:18,232 --> 00:06:20,065
He lives in the Himalayas.

36
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:26,482
See what clothes He wears, what He eats.

37
00:06:26,898 --> 00:06:33,065
He has no demand for anything because He's complete, He's perfect.

38
00:06:36,482 --> 00:06:40,690
Such a personality is Shiva's.

39
00:06:41,065 --> 00:06:44,898
And if you are worshipping Him,

40
00:06:44,981 --> 00:06:48,690
you should find out within your heart

41
00:06:49,232 --> 00:06:58,731
what sort of feelings you have, what sort of malice you nurture.

42
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:05,232
These days in India, greed has become the main point.

43
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:10,524
They are so mean and so low.

44
00:07:12,731 --> 00:07:20,856
Which impossible to understand that they think money is everything,

45
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,731
which is not in the culture of Indians, no, no.

46
00:07:27,065 --> 00:07:28,731
In no way.

47
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:32,649
But somehow they have picked it up,

48
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,232
in the foreign countries perhaps,

49
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:38,065
and it is spreading very much now,

50
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:41,232
that money is the most important thing.

51
00:07:42,898 --> 00:07:44,649
Think of Shiva.

52
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,898
He never thought of money.

53
00:07:50,981 --> 00:07:53,898
He never wanted any money.

54
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,981
He never wanted to show off himself.

55
00:08:01,357 --> 00:08:06,524
There is such a difference between Shiva and Shakti.

56
00:08:07,898 --> 00:08:09,898
In their whole attitude.

57
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:15,315
Because Shiva is absolutely a liberated personality,

58
00:08:15,524 --> 00:08:17,315
he's not bothered.

59
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,357
If the people

60
00:08:20,565 --> 00:08:23,856
are indulging into wrong things, he'll destroy - finished!

61
00:08:26,232 --> 00:08:27,649
He doesn't want to cure,

62
00:08:27,856 --> 00:08:30,232
He doesn't want to improve, nothing of the kind.

63
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:33,649
But for the Shakti it is important,

64
00:08:33,731 --> 00:08:38,649
because this is Her child, this universe is Her child.

65
00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:41,815
All this is created by Her,

66
00:08:41,856 --> 00:08:44,482
so naturally She is worried

67
00:08:44,856 --> 00:08:47,023
and She doesn't like people

68
00:08:47,315 --> 00:08:51,524
who try to take to mean things and nonsense.

69
00:08:54,898 --> 00:09:01,649
First of all it was human beings started indulging in power.

70
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:07,815
They moved from countries to country to empower themselves.

71
00:09:07,856 --> 00:09:09,981
Where is that power gone? Finished.

72
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,107
Then, after that, what happened with them

73
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:22,399
is that they left their style with others.

74
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,815
And now it seems

75
00:09:26,856 --> 00:09:31,524
it is very common to see people shamelessly being greedy.

76
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:40,232
For them, is the solution, is Shiva.

77
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,023
All such people will be destroyed. First of all

78
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:50,399
they will be exposed and then they will be destroyed,

79
00:09:50,815 --> 00:09:53,232
to the last bit of it.

80
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,023
Another thing is that

81
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:05,148
Shiva respects a person who has a good character;

82
00:10:05,524 --> 00:10:08,524
a person with a good character.

83
00:10:09,898 --> 00:10:14,023
And if anyone is bad charactered

84
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:23,148
or indulges into bad things, Shiva won't spare them.

85
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:31,731
So the Shakti creates, protects, looks after them, brings them up.

86
00:10:32,148 --> 00:10:36,399
But Shiva is sitting there, just to destroy!

87
00:10:37,815 --> 00:10:43,399
Very important, this destruction is very important.

88
00:10:43,815 --> 00:10:46,815
The Shakti doesn't show those qualities.

89
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:49,023
She may destroy some rakshasas,

90
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,856
but He can destroy nations after nations.

91
00:10:54,315 --> 00:11:01,815
First of all the ego you have - who will destroy that?

92
00:11:01,898 --> 00:11:08,148
, Shiva. Shiva is in your Sahasrara.

93
00:11:08,565 --> 00:11:10,815
He is sitting in the Sahasrara;

94
00:11:10,898 --> 00:11:14,399
now remember, on top of everything.

95
00:11:16,565 --> 00:11:27,981
The other day I saw one gentleman from the Broadcasting, a newsman,

96
00:11:28,023 --> 00:11:34,981
who was very, very stupid and was talking, very harshly.

97
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:42,315
And I saw his Ekadesha Rudra "My God" I said,

98
00:11:43,148 --> 00:11:47,148
"This one is now going to be in trouble. "

99
00:11:47,565 --> 00:11:52,815
What is Ekadesha is nothing but the eleven powers of Shiva.

100
00:11:52,898 --> 00:11:56,190
They build up here

101
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:59,357
and give you all kinds of diseases;

102
00:11:59,524 --> 00:12:02,690
the worst of all is cancer.

103
00:12:02,731 --> 00:12:07,565
And I knew that this fellow is going to have a very bad time.

104
00:12:07,981 --> 00:12:11,856
He is not a Sahaja Yogi, how am I to tell him?

105
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,898
How anybody has to tell him?

106
00:12:15,315 --> 00:12:18,731
But it comes from this Ekadesha Rudra.

107
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:24,315
Now these are eleven powers of Shiva, very well described.

108
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:28,856
Now these powers start working on people,

109
00:12:28,898 --> 00:12:30,898
even on Sahaja Yogis,

110
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:36,565
if they do not follow the principle of Sahaja Yoga.

111
00:12:37,981 --> 00:12:41,856
He is, I should say, watching everything.

112
00:12:42,898 --> 00:12:45,981
Every part of your life He watches.

113
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:53,023
How you behave, what you do, what is your dharma

114
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,315
- He watches all that.

115
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:59,690
And so many saints have warned you,

116
00:12:59,815 --> 00:13:03,023
so many incarnations have warned you;

117
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:07,148
but I tell you if don't listen to them,

118
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:10,898
then Shiva is not going to listen.

119
00:13:11,315 --> 00:13:13,565
He doesn't listen to anyone.

120
00:13:15,981 --> 00:13:17,565
If he's angry, he's angry.

121
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:22,065
Whatever it is, very difficult to convince Him

122
00:13:22,482 --> 00:13:27,607
that 'Please spare this person, it's alright. Forgive.

123
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,815
' But his basic quality is forgiveness,

124
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:35,190
can you imagine? His basic quality is forgiveness.

125
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:41,565
But if He doesn't forgive, then you are finished.

126
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:48,065
Up to a point maybe He might forgive, but after that..

127
00:13:48,482 --> 00:13:52,856
It's a very, very difficult situation.

128
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:57,856
And I find that people don't realise

129
00:13:57,898 --> 00:14:00,482
what Shiva is.

130
00:14:01,856 --> 00:14:05,399
In the south we have two types of people worshipers.

131
00:14:05,565 --> 00:14:08,190
One are shaivaites, another vaishnavaites.

132
00:14:09,565 --> 00:14:11,898
They are having a big fight between them.

133
00:14:12,357 --> 00:14:14,065
Now it is less, much less.

134
00:14:14,482 --> 00:14:20,357
What is the work of Vishnu is to give you realisation,

135
00:14:20,731 --> 00:14:24,482
emancipation of human beings, evolution of human beings.

136
00:14:25,856 --> 00:14:33,981
But if you fail in your goodness, in your dharma,

137
00:14:34,065 --> 00:14:39,649
then Shiva comes in your life.

138
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,357
We have to understand

139
00:14:43,565 --> 00:14:47,357
that we are all surrounded by their powers,

140
00:14:47,731 --> 00:14:50,482
we are all made by their powers,

141
00:14:51,856 --> 00:14:55,856
is the Shakti who is protecting you.

142
00:14:55,981 --> 00:15:02,482
But to an extent. She cannot go above Shiva,

143
00:15:04,898 --> 00:15:07,065
She cannot cross Him.

144
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:15,482
These days you find so many people indulging into politics

145
00:15:15,898 --> 00:15:18,065
- it's all money-making propositions.

146
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:23,981
They all try to make money, it's not politics!

147
00:15:24,065 --> 00:15:29,065
They don't do any good to the whole communities, nowhere

148
00:15:29,482 --> 00:15:33,731
- either under fear or under abandonment.

149
00:15:33,815 --> 00:15:41,065
They behave in such a manner that they are not afraid of God,

150
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:48,065
they are not afraid of His own attention on them.

151
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:53,981
Perhaps they don't know that they are under the attention of Shiva.

152
00:15:55,856 --> 00:15:57,856
He's watching each and every person,

153
00:15:59,731 --> 00:16:04,524
whether you are Australian, English or Indian.

154
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:11,981
Whatever religion you may follow, He's watching them.

155
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:15,856
This is a thing one has to understand.

156
00:16:17,232 --> 00:16:19,232
And once you understand this,

157
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:25,898
you will accept that you have to be good and dharmic people.

158
00:16:26,357 --> 00:16:28,856
You have to be good character people.

159
00:16:30,232 --> 00:16:33,524
Why people talk of good character?

160
00:16:33,898 --> 00:16:35,856
Try to understand!

161
00:16:36,232 --> 00:16:40,232
It's stupidity these days when people don't believe in it.

162
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:44,649
People are doing all kinds of things,

163
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:54,815
they are drinking, they are playing this...money business.

164
00:16:55,232 --> 00:16:57,357
All kinds of things they are doing

165
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:06,649
without having any fear of the wrath of God.

166
00:17:07,815 --> 00:17:09,856
And that wrath comes from Shiva.

167
00:17:11,232 --> 00:17:12,856
I would like to warn you all,

168
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:16,148
though you are all my children - be careful!

169
00:17:17,524 --> 00:17:19,981
Try to weigh every step that you take.

170
00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:24,731
Of course I am there to support you, to help you,

171
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,856
to protect you.

172
00:17:26,232 --> 00:17:29,399
But, not beyond Shiva,

173
00:17:30,815 --> 00:17:32,399
I can't go beyond Him.

174
00:17:33,815 --> 00:17:42,649
It's such a power of Shiva, it's such an authority of Shiva.

175
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:48,148
And to worship Him means to worship goodness in Him.

176
00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:55,815
The goodness could be compassion, could be love,

177
00:17:55,856 --> 00:17:58,649
could be forgiveness, anything.

178
00:17:58,731 --> 00:18:00,856
He likes only good people,

179
00:18:01,232 --> 00:18:03,856
and He will protect only good people.

180
00:18:04,232 --> 00:18:09,023
For example, some people are very power oriented,

181
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:13,898
some are money oriented and some are power oriented.

182
00:18:14,023 --> 00:18:18,232
And the power oriented also do it for money sometimes,

183
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,232
that's the aim.

184
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,524
They'll not stay in Sahaj.

185
00:18:23,898 --> 00:18:26,524
They will be displaced.

186
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:28,731
They do it, and then come and ask for forgiveness,

187
00:18:29,148 --> 00:18:32,023
"Oh Mother forgive us, we have done it".

188
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:35,856
But try not to do anything of that kind.

189
00:18:36,023 --> 00:18:41,856
I, of course, forgive you, but Shiva, He won't, He won't.

190
00:18:44,315 --> 00:18:45,815
He will take you to task

191
00:18:45,856 --> 00:18:47,065
and then you will come to Me "Mother,

192
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:49,731
You must save us!" It's very difficult.

193
00:18:50,148 --> 00:18:53,815
From His clutches it is very difficult.

194
00:18:53,856 --> 00:18:57,148
Also He's a very forgiving person.

195
00:18:57,524 --> 00:19:00,815
He forgives you, many things.

196
00:19:00,898 --> 00:19:04,023
Because of Me also He forgives.

197
00:19:04,399 --> 00:19:07,524
But, after some time when He takes over,

198
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:12,148
there's no appeal, there's no safety.

199
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:15,148
I do not want to frighten you,

200
00:19:15,565 --> 00:19:18,898
but I want to tell you the truth, it is the truth.

201
00:19:19,315 --> 00:19:22,565
You have to try to be good people.

202
00:19:23,981 --> 00:19:29,731
You have to try to be really good character people.

203
00:19:30,148 --> 00:19:34,023
I am told some people who are in Sahaja Yoga

204
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:40,023
indulge in money laundering and all that.

205
00:19:40,815 --> 00:19:43,731
Also some of them have very bad characters,

206
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,148
they run after girls

207
00:19:46,482 --> 00:19:50,981
and they try to look at the girls and all sorts of things.

208
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:55,898
Now this has ruined the west especially.

209
00:19:56,315 --> 00:19:59,690
Also our Indians are learning from it.

210
00:20:01,731 --> 00:20:05,690
As it is, we have to respect ourselves.

211
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:12,023
If we don't respect ourselves, and we try to misbehave,

212
00:20:15,856 --> 00:20:20,399
I can only help you with your Kundalini.

213
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:26,690
But if you go too much beyond it,

214
00:20:26,815 --> 00:20:30,190
Ekadesha Rudra will catch, no doubt.

215
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:37,856
It's a very big barrier on your forehead.

216
00:20:38,898 --> 00:20:47,815
Eka-desha Rudra, and it is so effective nowadays, so much active.

217
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,607
All kinds of diseases which are coming out, is all incurable,

218
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,023
are because of Ekadesha.

219
00:20:57,482 --> 00:21:04,690
And also those who are suffering from possessions.

220
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:10,315
The other day I met somebody who was very much caught-up.

221
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,898
And the Ekadesha was working.

222
00:21:16,315 --> 00:21:21,773
I found out that he is very fanatically

223
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:26,690
influenced by something.

224
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,981
I don't want to name it,

225
00:21:31,315 --> 00:21:37,315
but these, we have found out, are not correct things.

226
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:40,773
In every religion we have

227
00:21:41,065 --> 00:21:45,065
people who are spreading nonsensical ideas.

228
00:21:45,482 --> 00:21:48,981
Now if you don't have discretion about it,

229
00:21:49,065 --> 00:21:50,898
nobody can help you.

230
00:21:51,315 --> 00:21:53,898
You should have a full discretion

231
00:21:54,315 --> 00:21:59,981
as to what is right and what is wrong.

232
00:22:03,065 --> 00:22:06,482
Then Shiva is with you.

233
00:22:06,856 --> 00:22:09,273
But if you indulge

234
00:22:09,565 --> 00:22:16,856
into all such nonsensical things, it is self-destructive, I must say

235
00:22:16,898 --> 00:22:22,190
But to the Self which is destructive is the power of Shiva.

236
00:22:23,565 --> 00:22:28,190
What we call the Self here, is the power of Shiva.

237
00:22:30,565 --> 00:22:34,190
He destroys by many ways, by many ways.

238
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:39,065
You can lose your reputation,

239
00:22:39,482 --> 00:22:42,065
you can lose your health,

240
00:22:43,482 --> 00:22:46,482
you can lose your wealth,

241
00:22:47,898 --> 00:22:49,856
everything can happen to you

242
00:22:50,065 --> 00:22:53,981
till you are completely finished and that

243
00:22:58,856 --> 00:23:01,565
I have known people on the death-bed also,

244
00:23:01,856 --> 00:23:04,856
start talking about money,

245
00:23:04,898 --> 00:23:07,940
'What should she get, money, how will he get money,

246
00:23:08,273 --> 00:23:09,357
and this and that'.

247
00:23:10,731 --> 00:23:12,773
Instead of talking about God

248
00:23:13,065 --> 00:23:16,565
or Self Realisation, they are talking like this.

249
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:20,815
It's such a noble thing.

250
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:27,190
But if you see Shiva, He doesn't possess anything,

251
00:23:27,649 --> 00:23:29,482
He doesn't want anything.

252
00:23:31,856 --> 00:23:33,731
Whatever you give to him,

253
00:23:33,815 --> 00:23:36,482
as a samarpana or anything,

254
00:23:36,856 --> 00:23:44,357
that He doesn't accept, and He passes on to the Shakti,

255
00:23:44,731 --> 00:23:46,731
"You do whatever you want to do. "

256
00:23:46,815 --> 00:23:51,649
She's the one who is working out everything

257
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:58,065
to benefit you to make you happy. He's not bothered.

258
00:23:58,482 --> 00:24:02,482
In this case, you have to please Shiva!

259
00:24:02,898 --> 00:24:05,357
He will not try to please you,

260
00:24:05,731 --> 00:24:08,731
you have to go all the way to please Him.

261
00:24:08,815 --> 00:24:13,482
It is a very difficult personality of Shiva.

262
00:24:15,898 --> 00:24:21,065
In the Koran, it is not written separately

263
00:24:21,273 --> 00:24:27,981
for Allah or for Shiva, it is not differentiated.

264
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:31,898
Because the people with whom He had to deal

265
00:24:32,232 --> 00:24:34,898
were all uneducated, stupid people.

266
00:24:34,981 --> 00:24:37,649
So He didn't give all the details that

267
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:40,856
God is in different forms.

268
00:24:41,232 --> 00:24:43,856
So there is only one Allah they know.

269
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:47,898
But they don't do anything that

270
00:24:47,981 --> 00:24:52,649
shows the differentiations of their jobs and work.

271
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:58,649
It is the Shakti who loves, I agree.

272
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:03,524
But She too, can get angry very much.

273
00:25:05,898 --> 00:25:08,856
And once She gets angry, there is no end to it!

274
00:25:12,232 --> 00:25:15,065
Now I have to tell you, as Sahaja Yogis,

275
00:25:15,524 --> 00:25:19,981
that you develop your qualities to please the Shiva.

276
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:30,649
It's too much of hankering, too much of 'wants'.

277
00:25:32,981 --> 00:25:36,856
All this is not necessary.

278
00:25:37,232 --> 00:25:41,524
Of course I want you to live well, and beautifully,

279
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:45,148
not stupidly - to go into jungles

280
00:25:45,524 --> 00:25:48,649
or to behave like hippies - that's not the point.

281
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,524
The point is,

282
00:25:50,898 --> 00:25:59,524
from your heart, the attachment to things must go away.

283
00:25:59,898 --> 00:26:04,357
A person who is a Shiva Bhakti

284
00:26:07,815 --> 00:26:10,524
- he doesn't care for money, he doesn't know about money.

285
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:16,815
He is a very generous person, extremely. He's just generous.

286
00:26:16,856 --> 00:26:21,898
People may say, "Stupid"- the way he goes on, the way he works it.

287
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:25,148
But I don't think so.

288
00:26:25,524 --> 00:26:33,856
That's not at all the description.

289
00:26:37,981 --> 00:26:40,649
The description of a man

290
00:26:40,981 --> 00:26:47,981
who is a bhakta of Shiva has no interest in money,

291
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,399
is very generous.

292
00:26:50,815 --> 00:26:54,856
Anything you ask from that, he'll give.

293
00:26:55,232 --> 00:26:57,690
Mahavira's was like that.

294
00:26:57,731 --> 00:27:03,898
Mahavira had gone for his meditation in his own garden

295
00:27:05,148 --> 00:27:12,399
and Vishnu as Shri Krishna

296
00:27:12,815 --> 00:27:14,232
came and told him that,

297
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,524
"See, I have no clothes.

298
00:27:16,898 --> 00:27:21,524
You have got this cloth, why don't you give me half of it?"

299
00:27:21,898 --> 00:27:28,815
He said, "All right, you can have it. You can have the whole. "

300
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:36,023
Because he said this, "My house is here, I'll just wear my clothes"

301
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,524
What he did was not

302
00:27:38,981 --> 00:27:43,815
to show that nudity is a very great thing.

303
00:27:43,856 --> 00:27:46,315
But if you see the Jains, what to do,

304
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:54,815
they make big, big statues of Mahavira

305
00:27:55,023 --> 00:27:57,815
showing Him completely nude.

306
00:27:57,856 --> 00:28:00,981
I mean, this is the perversion of human mind.

307
00:28:02,023 --> 00:28:03,981
Why He did it, we should know.

308
00:28:04,023 --> 00:28:07,148
He was so detached, so detached, to

309
00:28:07,524 --> 00:28:10,898
give away the clothes, what is the harm?

310
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:13,815
It was not to show-off or anything.

311
00:28:13,898 --> 00:28:19,565
But the generosity, people don't understand.

312
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:23,315
And the Jainies are the least generous!

313
00:28:26,023 --> 00:28:32,731
So the quality of all these great incarnations is also not understood.

314
00:28:33,148 --> 00:28:41,315
Because a kind of an illusion is there.

315
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:48,731
For example, Shiva is always with very few clothes, very few.

316
00:28:51,148 --> 00:28:55,315
And what does he eat? No-one knows.

317
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:01,565
What is his desires and what does he want? No-one knows.

318
00:29:02,981 --> 00:29:07,815
A person with a great knowledge of music will sing before him,

319
00:29:07,898 --> 00:29:08,981
He's alright.

320
00:29:09,023 --> 00:29:12,731
Or even any madcap comes and sings, He's alright.

321
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:17,731
For Him it doesn't matter,

322
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:23,731
He's not meticulous about how the music is and what the notes are,

323
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:27,315
whether it is alright or not, no.

324
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,981
He is beyond all these things.

325
00:29:30,023 --> 00:29:34,565
He is beyond all these formalities that we have about everything,

326
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,815
he is beyond.

327
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:43,482
He is spirituality itself, he is beyond all these things.

328
00:29:43,856 --> 00:29:49,148
Whether you are a musician or you are an artist,

329
00:29:49,482 --> 00:29:54,482
whatever it is you are, He'll enjoy.

330
00:29:54,856 --> 00:29:58,898
He's the enjoyer, and He'll enjoy -

331
00:29:59,315 --> 00:30:05,315
whatever is simple, whatever is given with the heart, He'll enjoy.

332
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:08,690
Whatever is expressed with the heart, He'll enjoy.

333
00:30:08,815 --> 00:30:13,023
He is not a conditioned person,

334
00:30:13,482 --> 00:30:17,898
that it should be modern, it should be such and such.

335
00:30:18,315 --> 00:30:19,856
He is not conditioned.

336
00:30:19,898 --> 00:30:24,856
He doesn't think that way like human beings who will sit down

337
00:30:24,898 --> 00:30:30,065
and make a meticulous everything, does it fit into it or not.

338
00:30:30,482 --> 00:30:33,981
Even, even for art,

339
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:39,856
even for anything that is created out of somebody's heart,

340
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:43,315
they will try to discourage that person.

341
00:30:44,731 --> 00:30:49,065
I have seen people, they have such conditioning.

342
00:30:49,482 --> 00:30:52,856
And one thing about Shiva, he has no

343
00:30:52,898 --> 00:30:56,482
conditioning of anything, nothing.

344
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:59,981
That's why they call him a mast-maulaa

345
00:31:00,065 --> 00:31:02,898
- He is not at all conditioned.

346
00:31:03,357 --> 00:31:05,898
If you have any conditioning in your mind,

347
00:31:06,107 --> 00:31:07,898
then you are not a Shivabhakta.

348
00:31:08,357 --> 00:31:11,482
It's all right, you should dress up well, you should do this …

349
00:31:11,856 --> 00:31:15,482
but you should not have conditioning that 'If you don't do that

350
00:31:15,856 --> 00:31:23,898
you are being out of cast, out of fashion, out of this …'.

351
00:31:25,357 --> 00:31:30,357
It is very difficult for people not to accept.

352
00:31:31,731 --> 00:31:35,065
All kinds of fashions are coming nowadays, all kinds.

353
00:31:35,482 --> 00:31:38,981
I tell them, "What is this?" "Oh this is the fashion. "

354
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:42,190
Is it some God behind this fashion,

355
00:31:42,649 --> 00:31:45,815
or is there some deity who is telling you these fashions?

356
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:48,649
Today it comes, tomorrow it will disappear.

357
00:31:49,815 --> 00:31:51,731
So, what I am saying,

358
00:31:51,815 --> 00:31:55,981
that if you have to worship Shiva,

359
00:31:56,065 --> 00:31:58,981
you should de-condition yourself.

360
00:31:59,731 --> 00:32:02,815
You are living in the world of Sahasrara.

361
00:32:03,649 --> 00:32:07,981
Now, somebody is not properly dressed - finished!

362
00:32:08,065 --> 00:32:11,649
Somebody is over-popularly dressed - finished!

363
00:32:11,815 --> 00:32:16,649
Human beings have a capacity to criticise everyone.

364
00:32:17,981 --> 00:32:22,232
And to criticise everyone, this is nothing fundamental

365
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:26,065
because if you do it on vibrations, one can understand.

366
00:32:26,482 --> 00:32:28,649
But not on vibrations, just

367
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:34,065
because 'this is not the fashion, that is not the fashion'.

368
00:32:35,482 --> 00:32:38,981
What is the fashion of Shiva, tell me.

369
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:41,482
Has He any fashions?

370
00:32:42,898 --> 00:32:45,232
Anything you give Him, He's happy.

371
00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:48,232
Whatever you give Him, He eats that.

372
00:32:48,649 --> 00:32:57,232
He is full of such appreciation because He is personified as Joy.

373
00:32:57,898 --> 00:33:00,690
He is peace and He is joy.

374
00:33:01,065 --> 00:33:04,731
If you are worshippers of Shiva,

375
00:33:04,856 --> 00:33:11,232
then you should not have any conditioning of any kind.

376
00:33:14,065 --> 00:33:18,232
I mean, normally I also wear simple saris, very simple.

377
00:33:18,649 --> 00:33:23,357
And it happens that people think I am a very poor woman.

378
00:33:23,731 --> 00:33:25,357
I am poor

379
00:33:26,815 --> 00:33:31,856
because I don't care for money, I don't bother.

380
00:33:32,232 --> 00:33:41,856
So, we should know that Shiva is the poorest man, purest God.

381
00:33:42,232 --> 00:33:47,815
He doesn't wear any alankaras, he doesn't wear anything, just

382
00:33:48,856 --> 00:33:51,856
he lives with his own body.

383
00:33:52,232 --> 00:33:58,690
Because he is nothing but embodiment of enjoyment,

384
00:33:59,148 --> 00:34:07,524
nothing but complete form of enjoyment and joy.

385
00:34:08,898 --> 00:34:13,524
So another quality of Shivabhakta* should be joy.

386
00:34:14,856 --> 00:34:18,524
You should be joyous about everything

387
00:34:18,898 --> 00:34:23,649
- whatever you see, whatever type of person you see.

388
00:34:23,856 --> 00:34:25,981
So the only way you can do, is

389
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:30,232
give up human quality of criticism

390
00:34:33,148 --> 00:34:35,399
- to criticise others.

391
00:34:35,815 --> 00:34:38,981
Like if the English go into the Indian house,

392
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:40,649
they say "We don't like it. "

393
00:34:40,731 --> 00:34:41,981
"Yes, what, what you don't like?"

394
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,981
"We didn't like the carpet. "

395
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:51,232
'I don't like it' itself is against your Shakti.

396
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:55,690
Then, if supposing an American goes to an English home,

397
00:34:55,731 --> 00:34:58,815
he'll say, "I don't like it. " It's very common.

398
00:34:58,856 --> 00:35:02,399
All the people say "I don't like it", "I didn't like that".

399
00:35:02,815 --> 00:35:04,524
Who are you

400
00:35:04,898 --> 00:35:08,148
to say 'I don't like it' or 'I like it'.

401
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:12,898
People don't realise that by saying all these things,

402
00:35:13,023 --> 00:35:17,524
you are showing that there is no Shiva principle in you.

403
00:35:20,898 --> 00:35:24,731
I can understand somebody who cannot walk, alright,

404
00:35:25,148 --> 00:35:30,815
for such a person is allowed to use some sticks or something,

405
00:35:30,856 --> 00:35:32,856
allowed.

406
00:35:33,315 --> 00:35:34,815
But if he says "I don't like that person

407
00:35:35,023 --> 00:35:37,399
because he doesn't use the stick.",

408
00:35:37,815 --> 00:35:41,690
shows that he is such an egoistical fellow;

409
00:35:41,731 --> 00:35:45,731
himself is using the stick and

410
00:35:46,065 --> 00:35:49,232
he wants to create what, warns or what,

411
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,148
in a democratic country, that people should

412
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:57,148
walk with the sticks in their hands. It is very difficult.

413
00:35:57,524 --> 00:36:00,399
In the west it is very common, you see,

414
00:36:00,815 --> 00:36:02,731
to have this kind of a hat,

415
00:36:03,148 --> 00:36:05,981
to have this kind of a dress,

416
00:36:06,023 --> 00:36:07,898
to wear this kind of a cheroot.

417
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:11,815
All kinds of things have a conditioning.

418
00:36:12,898 --> 00:36:18,315
Nowadays the hairstyle has become very funny with women.

419
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:21,981
Because they don't put oil in their hair.

420
00:36:23,023 --> 00:36:28,898
They will not have any grease in their hair.

421
00:36:29,315 --> 00:36:32,690
If somebody's going to meet them they will wash their hair.

422
00:36:33,731 --> 00:36:35,981
I don't think it looks very nice.

423
00:36:36,023 --> 00:36:37,315
Of course I don't say that

424
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:42,565
you need not have so much of oil on your face and ears.

425
00:36:42,981 --> 00:36:46,023
But, what is so important?

426
00:36:48,731 --> 00:36:57,898
In life, is also this is another thing that we are very self-centred.

427
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:01,690
We want to impress people.

428
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:09,981
If I wear a dress or anything, it should impress.

429
00:37:11,023 --> 00:37:14,690
I mean, even it impresses - what?

430
00:37:15,731 --> 00:37:19,731
If a snake comes along, he will bit you, whatever dress

431
00:37:20,565 --> 00:37:24,190
you might be wearing, whatever country you might be from.

432
00:37:24,565 --> 00:37:32,315
All this kind of identification, it doesn't behove a Shivabhakta.

433
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:37,315
A Shivabhakta has to be just

434
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:42,315
absolutely lost in the raptures of joy.

435
00:37:44,482 --> 00:37:49,898
Very particular about hairdress, very particular about dresses

436
00:37:50,107 --> 00:37:52,856
- I don't know what they are particular about.

437
00:37:52,898 --> 00:37:56,898
With all that, what do they gain? Nothing.

438
00:37:58,315 --> 00:38:00,357
Do they become popular?

439
00:38:01,148 --> 00:38:03,649
And this kind of popularity,

440
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:07,482
which is so skin-deep, what's the use?

441
00:38:08,856 --> 00:38:13,482
You must have respect, respect of your being.

442
00:38:13,856 --> 00:38:19,731
As not only human beings, but as Sahaja Yogis.

443
00:38:20,815 --> 00:38:22,856
You are Sahaja Yogis.

444
00:38:22,898 --> 00:38:28,565
We are Shiva's bhaktas, we don't care.

445
00:38:29,981 --> 00:38:31,565
We are not bothered.

446
00:38:32,898 --> 00:38:37,815
Whatever it is, Shiva is there within us

447
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:47,898
and we shine with that power within us that is of Kundalini.

448
00:38:50,065 --> 00:38:52,815
You may be very well dressed, you may be anything.

449
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:55,482
If your vibrations are bad, what's the use?

450
00:38:56,856 --> 00:38:58,649
If you cannot judge people

451
00:38:58,981 --> 00:39:01,649
by their vibrations,by nonsensical things

452
00:39:01,981 --> 00:39:07,273
like their dress and moustaches, is it of any value?

453
00:39:07,565 --> 00:39:12,898
In Sahaja Yoga your value system has to be Sahaj.

454
00:39:15,357 --> 00:39:17,565
I have seen many people,

455
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:20,856
"I don't like their house, I didn't like this …"

456
00:39:20,898 --> 00:39:26,565
'I don't like' is the sentence, is nishidda,

457
00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:30,357
is to be given up by Sahaja Yogis.

458
00:39:33,731 --> 00:39:36,065
If you don't like anything, you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

459
00:39:39,981 --> 00:39:46,190
Now, of course, I mean, if there is somebody who is anti-Sahaj and all that,

460
00:39:46,649 --> 00:39:51,065
but still by saying 'I don't like', what are you going to gain?

461
00:39:52,981 --> 00:39:54,856
It's a waste of energy.

462
00:39:58,981 --> 00:40:03,981
Because of this, in Sahaja Yoga I have seen,

463
00:40:04,065 --> 00:40:08,190
people have created problems for Me, so many problems.

464
00:40:08,649 --> 00:40:13,065
Only because they are such much 'self' oriented.

465
00:40:15,482 --> 00:40:19,482
"This man is bad, that woman is bad, he is this, that …"

466
00:40:19,856 --> 00:40:21,190
Sometimes I am surprised.

467
00:40:21,482 --> 00:40:24,482
Because when those people come to me,

468
00:40:24,815 --> 00:40:28,065
I am amazed that they are very nice people.

469
00:40:29,482 --> 00:40:32,981
But people are very self-centred, also.

470
00:40:33,273 --> 00:40:38,065
Like I have seen people who are not bothered

471
00:40:38,482 --> 00:40:45,357
to come to meetings, to pujas.

472
00:40:46,731 --> 00:40:48,898
Because they have got work.

473
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:56,981
Altogether there are eleven pujas, but they don't come.

474
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:01,981
Because they are very busy.

475
00:41:03,357 --> 00:41:05,649
At least to one puja you should come.

476
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:15,357
But those who are Shivabhaktas only enjoy nothing but pujas.

477
00:41:15,898 --> 00:41:17,898
Nothing else

478
00:41:18,981 --> 00:41:25,232
Their whole being is absolutely vibrated by Shiva bhakti.

479
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,357
To them, that's the most important thing to do.

480
00:41:29,731 --> 00:41:32,649
Also there are people in Sahaja Yoga

481
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,981
who are trying to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

482
00:41:36,357 --> 00:41:39,856
Very wrong, very wrong, very wrong.

483
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:45,649
Sahaja Yoga is to give you punyas,

484
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:48,065
to give you blessings,

485
00:41:48,524 --> 00:41:51,690
and if that is not in your mind,

486
00:41:52,148 --> 00:41:53,065
better give up Sahaja Yoga.

487
00:41:53,315 --> 00:41:56,649
You can join some business or something

488
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:59,524
of malpractices very easily, very easily.

489
00:41:59,898 --> 00:42:02,148
Till you end up in the jail you are there.

490
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:10,981
But to enjoy your spiritual powers

491
00:42:11,357 --> 00:42:13,981
you must learn certain things.

492
00:42:14,357 --> 00:42:17,856
And one of them is de-condition yourself

493
00:42:18,232 --> 00:42:21,856
- 'I don't like it' or 'I like it' -

494
00:42:22,148 --> 00:42:26,399
this sentence must go away from your tongue!

495
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:32,815
Likes and dislikes

496
00:42:32,856 --> 00:42:35,815
are only for people who have limited vision.

497
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:42,148
You should learn to appreciate.

498
00:42:42,524 --> 00:42:44,856
Your power of appreciation will show

499
00:42:45,232 --> 00:42:48,273
how spiritually you are endowed.

500
00:42:51,649 --> 00:42:57,148
And your power of observation

501
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,649
will show what do you observe.

502
00:43:00,731 --> 00:43:03,524
For example, some people will come and tell me,

503
00:43:03,731 --> 00:43:08,148
"I didn't like that lady, she was wearing a funny sari. "

504
00:43:09,524 --> 00:43:11,148
I mean, what is this?

505
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:18,731
"I didn't like her, because she was putting her hand on her head".

506
00:43:19,148 --> 00:43:21,023
So what?

507
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:25,232
Because you make your own images of people, and you want

508
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:29,690
everybody to be like that, otherwise you don't like it.

509
00:43:30,148 --> 00:43:33,815
Whether you like it or don't like it, nobody's going to change.

510
00:43:34,856 --> 00:43:37,148
Why waste your energy?

511
00:43:38,898 --> 00:43:42,232
Sometimes there are musicians who are not so good.

512
00:43:49,148 --> 00:43:57,315
I remember, once I went home and I asked my father,

513
00:43:57,690 --> 00:43:59,731
"How does this musician sing?"

514
00:44:00,148 --> 00:44:03,981
He says, "He's very courageous, very courageous. "

515
00:44:04,023 --> 00:44:05,981
I said, "Why, what happened?"

516
00:44:06,232 --> 00:44:10,815
He said, "He sings without bothering about it

517
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:13,273
and he goes out of tune sometimes,

518
00:44:13,482 --> 00:44:15,690
he goes out of taala, doesn't matter,

519
00:44:15,731 --> 00:44:17,023
but he sings.

520
00:44:17,399 --> 00:44:19,148
He's very courageous, himmatwala"

521
00:44:19,524 --> 00:44:23,690
So, that's how he used to appreciate, I have seen.

522
00:44:23,731 --> 00:44:29,023
When this fellow started singing, I saw he was like that,

523
00:44:29,399 --> 00:44:34,399
but my father was saying "Wa-wa, wa-wa" and encouraging him.

524
00:44:34,815 --> 00:44:38,731
You see, I have seen in my father these divine qualities,

525
00:44:39,148 --> 00:44:42,023
how he used to tolerate,

526
00:44:42,399 --> 00:44:46,565
how he used to - I mean not tolerance also, just appreciation.

527
00:44:46,981 --> 00:44:50,399
Of any kind of thing he used to appreciate.

528
00:44:50,565 --> 00:44:53,607
That's what, if the Sahaja Yogis have that

529
00:44:53,898 --> 00:44:58,898
condition of appreciation they will enjoy everything.

530
00:44:59,107 --> 00:45:02,315
Because you kill your enjoyment, do you know that?

531
00:45:04,731 --> 00:45:08,315
You are all variety of people here, all variety of dresses,

532
00:45:08,482 --> 00:45:13,190
all variety of families and so many countries you are here.

533
00:45:13,565 --> 00:45:16,981
To Me you are nothing but Sahaja Yogis, my children, that's all.

534
00:45:19,023 --> 00:45:22,482
Now I don't go on judging you on your dress, or

535
00:45:22,649 --> 00:45:25,565
on what your hairstyle is, no.

536
00:45:27,023 --> 00:45:30,190
All modern things are extremely conditioning.

537
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:38,190
And they condition you so much that you get irresponsible.

538
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:41,731
As Sahaja Yogis you get irresponsible.

539
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:46,981
Your first and foremost responsibility is Sahaja Yoga.

540
00:45:47,023 --> 00:45:49,898
Because you should know what a work it is.

541
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:57,815
It is such a great work, to transform the whole world - that is My vision.

542
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:01,482
And this old age I think the same.

543
00:46:01,856 --> 00:46:06,190
Now, if that is My vision, what should be your attitude?

544
00:46:06,565 --> 00:46:10,815
That we should go all out to spread Sahaja Yoga.

545
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:12,898
That's the main thing.

546
00:46:13,315 --> 00:46:20,482
I call you for these pujas just to renovate, I should say,

547
00:46:20,856 --> 00:46:24,190
to give you more of energy and all that.

548
00:46:24,565 --> 00:46:27,399
But if you are just taking it as a great

549
00:46:27,649 --> 00:46:30,649
blessings and sitting at home it's of no use.

550
00:46:31,815 --> 00:46:33,731
You must spread Sahaja Yoga!

551
00:46:33,815 --> 00:46:36,981
I was surprised that they said

552
00:46:37,273 --> 00:46:43,482
in Lucknow there are only 200 Sahaja Yogis. How can that be?

553
00:46:43,981 --> 00:46:45,981
First time I went to Lucknow,

554
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:48,565
there were at least three thousand Sahaja Yogis

555
00:46:48,981 --> 00:46:52,065
and we had not fixed any hall or anything.

556
00:46:52,482 --> 00:46:56,565
And can you imagine, suddenly I find so many people.

557
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,856
How is it there can be two hundred Sahaja Yogis?

558
00:47:00,898 --> 00:47:06,065
Either you are telling lies, or you are good for nothing.

559
00:47:07,482 --> 00:47:10,482
So the responsibility of all the Sahaja Yogis,

560
00:47:10,731 --> 00:47:15,815
of all the Sahaja Yogis, first and foremost,

561
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:17,981
is to spread Sahaja Yoga.

562
00:47:19,065 --> 00:47:21,190
How many people have you given realisation?

563
00:47:22,565 --> 00:47:24,815
Where have you talked about Sahaja Yoga?

564
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:28,565
I have seen even in the plane, if you are travelling,

565
00:47:28,856 --> 00:47:33,607
anyone who is there will tell Me "My guru is this,

566
00:47:33,898 --> 00:47:36,565
you know, such a great guru, this that. "

567
00:47:36,981 --> 00:47:40,357
Openly, shamelessly, about horrible gurus!

568
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:47,856
While you people are very shy to talk about Sahaja Yoga.

569
00:47:48,981 --> 00:47:52,065
Never publicly unless and until

570
00:47:52,482 --> 00:47:56,856
you have a programme, and public programme and all that.

571
00:47:58,981 --> 00:48:03,856
You have no time, also, for Sahaja Yoga, very busy people.

572
00:48:08,357 --> 00:48:15,607
So, if you have to follow Shiva and His blessings all the time,

573
00:48:15,815 --> 00:48:17,357
His protection to you...

574
00:48:17,649 --> 00:48:25,065
then you have to be Sahaja Yogis of very high quality.

575
00:48:27,482 --> 00:48:30,482
It shows when you go all out

576
00:48:30,898 --> 00:48:32,815
to spread Sahaja Yoga.

577
00:48:35,731 --> 00:48:38,065
That is the thing missing.

578
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:41,357
I am very happy that in Australia

579
00:48:41,731 --> 00:48:44,065
Sahaja Yoga has spread so much.

580
00:48:44,482 --> 00:48:47,815
I don't know what has happened.

581
00:48:48,232 --> 00:48:51,731
In a far fetched place like Australia.

582
00:48:52,649 --> 00:48:55,898
In the beginning I had some set-backs

583
00:48:55,981 --> 00:49:00,773
but now it has spread. Also in Austria it has spread.

584
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:03,649
And also in Italy.

585
00:49:05,731 --> 00:49:10,731
But otherwise, just doesn't spread. What's the matter?

586
00:49:10,856 --> 00:49:14,690
The matter is the leaders are not going all-out.

587
00:49:15,065 --> 00:49:18,981
Say, for in England I travelled from north to south,

588
00:49:19,357 --> 00:49:21,898
east to west in all the directions.

589
00:49:24,649 --> 00:49:30,065
We have very poor, very poor Sahaja Yogis there.

590
00:49:30,524 --> 00:49:35,649
You have to go to universities, to younger people.

591
00:49:36,731 --> 00:49:42,690
If hippy-ism can spread, why not Sahaja Yoga?

592
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:50,232
It spread like wild-fire, why not Sahaja Yoga?

593
00:49:50,649 --> 00:49:57,232
All these things are there, which I have to warn you - be careful!

594
00:49:58,649 --> 00:50:02,357
If you have got Realisation, you have a responsibility

595
00:50:02,815 --> 00:50:07,898
- to give realisation to others, and to spread Sahaja Yoga.

596
00:50:10,981 --> 00:50:14,856
If you can't do it, then God save you.

597
00:50:15,232 --> 00:50:16,649
I have nothing to say.

598
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:20,690
You have to introspect,

599
00:50:21,148 --> 00:50:23,148
'What have I done for Sahaja Yoga.

600
00:50:24,524 --> 00:50:26,148
What have I got from Sahaja Yoga?'

601
00:50:28,524 --> 00:50:32,357
And I am sure after this Shiva puja,

602
00:50:32,607 --> 00:50:37,232
you will dedicate yourself to Shiva principle within you.

603
00:50:37,524 --> 00:50:41,524
Shiva principle doesn't 'stir out',

604
00:50:41,898 --> 00:50:50,649
it's very, very stern, it's very powerful.

605
00:50:53,731 --> 00:50:59,148
You have to dedicate, and you have to surrender.

606
00:50:59,524 --> 00:51:05,856
Above every other job, above every other performance,

607
00:51:06,232 --> 00:51:08,148
the highest is this.

608
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:16,399
So, with this, I ask Shiva to give you blessings,

609
00:51:16,815 --> 00:51:18,731
complete blessings,

610
00:51:19,148 --> 00:51:25,023
so that you get transformed into the personality of Shiva.

611
00:51:25,399 --> 00:51:26,782
May God bless you all
