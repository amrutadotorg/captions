00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.834
So now most of you are here,

00:00:05.874 --> 00:00:17.772
and it’s a nice place for all of you
to meet from different countries.

00:00:19.065 --> 00:00:24.323
Aurangabad has a special significance in my own life

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.928
because my forefathers came from
a place very near from here,

00:00:30.953 --> 00:00:35.597
called as Pathan
but originally known as Pratishthan.

00:00:35.622 --> 00:00:40.981
I think about two years back we were there,

00:00:41.498 --> 00:00:49.159
and this is the place where Valmiki,
who wrote the great epic of Ramayana,

00:00:49.184 --> 00:00:55.951
lived here. And when Sita came,

00:00:56.035 --> 00:01:03.524
was taken away from her house

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:06.932
and when she was pregnant,

00:01:06.957 --> 00:01:13.060
there was another ashram of his in Nepal where she stayed,

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:17.769
and then she was brought here.

00:01:17.788 --> 00:01:23.327
That’s why you see a kind of a

00:01:26.557 --> 00:01:33.655
culture of Maharashtra, going to the hills
and also to Nepal, through her

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:41.427
and her children who went down,
went to Russia and another to China.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.003
The name of one who went to Russia
was Luv,

00:01:47.028 --> 00:01:50.432
and another who went to China was Kush.

00:01:50.457 --> 00:01:53.289
So they are called as Slavs.

00:01:53.342 --> 00:01:55.921
They were mostly called as Lev,

00:01:56.145 --> 00:02:00.239
and those who went to China
are called as Kusha.

00:02:00.264 --> 00:02:04.518
So they lived here from their birth

00:02:04.543 --> 00:02:08.404
till they became about, say, twelve years of age,

00:02:08.471 --> 00:02:12.196
when Valmiki composed Ramayana

00:02:12.228 --> 00:02:17.400
and taught them how to sing that song of Ramayana.

00:02:17.543 --> 00:02:21.113
So then they went to Ayodhya

00:02:21.138 --> 00:02:25.063
and there they started singing the song.

00:02:25.218 --> 00:02:28.815
With that singing, Shri Rama was very much touched.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.648
They challenged him in a way, that
there is a lady who was such a chaste person,

00:02:33.673 --> 00:02:40.500
who was driven out of - they didn’t know
that was Rama was their father.

00:02:41.667 --> 00:02:47.460
Then they came back and stayed here

00:02:48.511 --> 00:02:53.966
for some time and then went again to Nepal
because  she was a Nepali lady.

00:02:53.991 --> 00:02:59.072
So I think her father must have arranged
something for her to stay in Nepal

00:02:59.097 --> 00:03:05.459
in that Valmiki ashram,
which can be only approached from Bihar,

00:03:05.484 --> 00:03:08.063
which I have seen Myself.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:16.051
Also that’s a very important spot where
this ashram was established by Valmiki,

00:03:16.068 --> 00:03:19.892
because here there was a big struggle of evolution

00:03:19.917 --> 00:03:23.439
going on between the big animals like mammoth

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.490
and all those big, big animals,

00:03:26.515 --> 00:03:30.048
between the others who were very quick to turn

00:03:30.073 --> 00:03:36.082
and were very clever, intelligent and supple.

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:39.974
They destroyed most of these big animals.

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:46.339
And in that river there were lots of crocodiles,

00:03:46.794 --> 00:03:53.363
and when the king of the elephant, known as Gajendra,

00:03:53.388 --> 00:03:57.267
was drinking in water, one of them, a big one,

00:03:57.292 --> 00:04:03.332
attacked to kill him so that the whole clan,

00:04:03.357 --> 00:04:09.348
or you can say the whole genii
of these elephants, would be destroyed.

00:04:10.411 --> 00:04:14.143
That spot is very important

00:04:14.168 --> 00:04:16.731
because there Shri Vishnu appeared

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:20.132
and he killed the crocodile and saved the elephant.

00:04:20.157 --> 00:04:23.829
So out of all these
big animals, only the elephant was saved,

00:04:23.854 --> 00:04:28.254
and that’s why that place is called as Gajendramoksh.

00:04:28.373 --> 00:04:33.128
So there’s a big quarrel going on because
Valmiki had his ashrams in different places,

00:04:33.128 --> 00:04:35.793
where [was real of Valmiki’s things].

00:04:35.818 --> 00:04:39.550
But actually he lived here in this area

00:04:39.567 --> 00:04:42.687
on the other side of the Godavari River

00:04:42.712 --> 00:04:50.140
which was going along the

00:04:50.387 --> 00:04:55.333
Paithan or the Pratishthan, the kingdom of Shalivana.

00:04:55.627 --> 00:05:00.945
And he used to plunder people and he was a plunderer.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.296
He was a fisherman and he was a plunderer.

00:05:05.067 --> 00:05:08.993
Then from there they say Narada came as a
saint from there,

00:05:09.018 --> 00:05:13.680
from the other side, and they plundered him also.

00:05:13.705 --> 00:05:17.422
So he said ,“Why are you plundering me?” Narada asked.

00:05:17.447 --> 00:05:21.676
He said, “Because I have to feed my children.
I have to feed my wife.

00:05:21.701 --> 00:05:24.508
I have to feed my family. I have to look after them.

00:05:24.533 --> 00:05:27.782
I have a large family. So how am I to maintain all that?

00:05:27.807 --> 00:05:30.739
I am the only person who is the earning member. “

00:05:30.764 --> 00:05:34.039
But he said, “Do you think
they will sacrifice everything for you?”

00:05:34.064 --> 00:05:36.927
He said, “I am sure they will.”
He said, “All right."

00:05:36.952 --> 00:05:40.467
Now you become like a dead man.”

00:05:40.492 --> 00:05:44.414
And they took his dead body, so-called, four of them,

00:05:44.423 --> 00:05:47.557
four saints, and put it in the house

00:05:47.582 --> 00:05:52.455
and told them that this fellow died in plundering us.

00:05:52.503 --> 00:05:57.315
“But there is a way to again bring him to life,

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.780
that you have to promise that somebody from you,

00:06:01.805 --> 00:06:05.585
you all, have to die in his place.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:12.610
If you agree that you will die in his place,
then one person has to replace him.”

00:06:14.282 --> 00:06:16.955
They tried and tried.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.434
And somebody said, “No, I cannot die. I am too young.”

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:23.334
Another said,“No, I have to look after my children.”

00:06:23.359 --> 00:06:28.240
Another said, “What will happen to my grandchildren?”
all kinds of things.

00:06:28.265 --> 00:06:31.622
And nobody offered themselves.

00:06:31.647 --> 00:06:36.368
So Valmiki got up and he realised that so far

00:06:36.392 --> 00:06:40.267
he has been really doing something wrong.

00:06:40.413 --> 00:06:44.453
So he said then, “What should I say?”

00:06:44.478 --> 00:06:46.927
He said, “What would you say then if you
die?”

00:06:46.952 --> 00:06:49.596
He said, “I’ll say, ‘Mara, mara’,” means,

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.661
‘I am dead. I am dead. I am dead’.”

00:06:51.686 --> 00:06:53.241
He said, “All right, say the other way.

00:06:53.266 --> 00:06:57.000
Go on saying.” So it came to,
“Rama, Rama,” like that.

00:06:57.025 --> 00:06:58.938
But they said, “It won’t work out.

00:06:58.947 --> 00:07:00.943
You have to do a penance

00:07:00.968 --> 00:07:04.276
because you have done lots of bad things in your life

00:07:04.301 --> 00:07:06.789
and you have hurt many people.

00:07:06.825 --> 00:07:10.313
So you have to do the penance.”

00:07:10.667 --> 00:07:17.005
So he sat down for penance on a big mountain here

00:07:17.043 --> 00:07:19.372
which is called as the Valmiki Mountain.

00:07:20.675 --> 00:07:23.561
And the termites ate up his body,

00:07:23.611 --> 00:07:25.658
and he became like a termite.

00:07:25.674 --> 00:07:27.929
Only his neck was up and he was saying that

00:07:27.954 --> 00:07:31.196
and the whole body was eaten up by termites.

00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:34.522
So then again Shri Vishnu appeared before him

00:07:34.547 --> 00:07:38.767
and removed his termites and gave him his realisation.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.207
And a termite in Sanskrit language is called as valmi.

00:07:43.232 --> 00:07:45.847
That’s why he was called as valmi ki. That’s why

00:07:45.872 --> 00:07:48.165
he was called as Valmiki.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:55.895
So the story then afterwards leads
to the coming of Sita there.

00:07:55.996 --> 00:08:00.447
So it is a very important part of Ramayana was played here,

00:08:00.472 --> 00:08:04.413
and it is said that Shalivahanas helped

00:08:04.438 --> 00:08:10.190
this Valmiki temple and Valmiki person to prosper,

00:08:10.215 --> 00:08:14.811
and they treated him with great respect as their master.

00:08:14.836 --> 00:08:18.816
But actually, their master was long
time back was one Chandalia

00:08:18.841 --> 00:08:23.423
where we have taken the land near Nira River.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.922
So it’s a very ancient time thousands of years back

00:08:27.947 --> 00:08:33.051
because Rama must have lived before Krishna,
say about eight thousand years back.

00:08:33.076 --> 00:08:37.742
So it is a very ancient place, this one is.

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:40.723
After that people removed all the trees and all that.

00:08:40.748 --> 00:08:43.199
So it has become such a barren land

00:08:43.224 --> 00:08:51.025
and it is not sort of so fertile now,

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:55.240
but once upon a time it was a beautiful forest here

00:08:55.265 --> 00:08:59.837
and in that forest Valmiki used to live.

00:08:59.862 --> 00:09:02.225
So this is the story of this place, I hope

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:06.493
you will be happy to know you are in a very
historical place just now.

00:09:06.518 --> 00:09:09.809
And I am trying to find out if you can on your way go to

00:09:09.834 --> 00:09:13.057
also to this Paithan, Pratishthan

00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:15.065
on your way, maybe. I don’t know how,

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.357
because we are all running short of time

00:09:17.382 --> 00:09:20.406
because of aeroplane timings, as you know.

00:09:20.423 --> 00:09:24.191
But in any case I am very happy
that also Italians have arrived,

00:09:24.216 --> 00:09:27.140
and they have taken so much trouble to come all the way

00:09:27.165 --> 00:09:30.193
directly from there to get to the puja.

00:09:30.202 --> 00:09:35.081
Though I had arranged in Pratishthan
all their food, everything, breakfast,

00:09:35.106 --> 00:09:38.155
so they could sleep in the night and early in the morning

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.569
take the food and come here.

00:09:42.746 --> 00:09:45.150
All these stories these
people know very well.

00:09:45.175 --> 00:09:49.323
We all know everything about our country,
these ancient times,

00:09:49.348 --> 00:09:56.781
you see, grand, beautiful, and the
work of all these saints and all these

00:09:56.806 --> 00:10:05.084
seers has woven into the character of Maharashtran people.

00:10:05.109 --> 00:10:10.049
So you will find them that they have certain gifts

00:10:10.074 --> 00:10:14.986
already to protect themselves,
which has come because of the

00:10:15.011 --> 00:10:22.792
following of these saints and
the following of a realised soul.

00:10:22.832 --> 00:10:25.511
And the people are very God-fearing

00:10:25.536 --> 00:10:31.266
and they respect saints and
they also know who is a real saint mostly.

00:10:33.631 --> 00:10:37.658
I hope you all will understand that

00:10:37.682 --> 00:10:41.475
when we think of the comfort of our spirit,

00:10:41.505 --> 00:10:46.006
the whole life is sort of penetrated
with the light of the spirit,

00:10:46.031 --> 00:10:49.153
and we start changing our attitude towards life.

00:10:49.178 --> 00:10:54.039
Not only that, but also we have a kind of a

00:10:54.071 --> 00:10:58.593
tremendous confidence in our virtues
and we enjoy them.

00:10:58.971 --> 00:11:03.494
We do not indulge into any such thing.

00:11:03.527 --> 00:11:05.799
Though in a way we can say that the,

00:11:05.824 --> 00:11:11.517
in this culture there is not much of finesse,
not much of artificiality.

00:11:11.542 --> 00:11:14.962
They won’t say thank you a hundred times.
That is not done.

00:11:14.994 --> 00:11:16.573
They don’t say sorry.

00:11:16.598 --> 00:11:19.489
They won’t even fold their hands to normally,

00:11:19.514 --> 00:11:22.934
the women especially to men, and say namaskar.

00:11:22.959 --> 00:11:25.598
Only to God they fold their hands.

00:11:25.631 --> 00:11:28.003
So there are certain things, that

00:11:28.028 --> 00:11:30.714
all the time we go on shaking hands in the West.

00:11:30.739 --> 00:11:34.136
All the time we start bowing to everyone, saying sorry,

00:11:34.136 --> 00:11:35.884
thank you and all that.

00:11:35.897 --> 00:11:37.610
That you will find they don’t do,

00:11:37.635 --> 00:11:41.008
but at heart they are very simple people.

00:11:41.033 --> 00:11:45.921
They live among rocks; so they
have that rocky character.

00:11:45.946 --> 00:11:48.057
And I hope you will enjoy them.

00:11:48.082 --> 00:11:50.514
May God bless you.
