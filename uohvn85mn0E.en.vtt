00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:04.339
It is really gratifying

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:07.339
to come to Melbourne

00:03:08.018 --> 00:03:10.018
I came here

00:03:10.463 --> 00:03:13.941
because somebody who had come to Sydney

00:03:15.258 --> 00:03:19.171
and said that "Mother, you must come to Melbourne.

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:21.365
We need you."

00:03:24.386 --> 00:03:26.962
When I came here for some other purpose,

00:03:29.535 --> 00:03:33.442
I felt vibrations of Melbourne

00:03:34.861 --> 00:03:36.256
are really very good,

00:03:37.974 --> 00:03:40.779
and here it is quite possible

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.129
that there maybe many seekers.

00:03:48.351 --> 00:03:50.351
It is really gratifying as I said

00:03:50.616 --> 00:03:52.045
to be here among you.

00:03:55.195 --> 00:03:58.183
It's a fact that the time has come

00:03:58.555 --> 00:04:01.029
for thousands and thousands and thousands

00:04:01.315 --> 00:04:03.315
and millions of them

00:04:04.926 --> 00:04:07.442
who are born as seekers on this earth,

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.764
have to get their Realisation.

00:04:14.038 --> 00:04:16.038
They have to know their meaning.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.709
They have to know why

00:04:19.508 --> 00:04:23.967
why the nature has made them a human being from amoeba.

00:04:25.301 --> 00:04:27.301
What is the purpose of their life?

00:04:28.122 --> 00:04:30.934
Unless and until you find the purpose of your life

00:04:31.327 --> 00:04:33.327
you are not going to be happy.

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.169
You are not going to be satisfied.

00:04:36.306 --> 00:04:38.005
You may try anything else.

00:04:38.398 --> 00:04:40.656
You may have one of those ego trips;

00:04:41.455 --> 00:04:45.529
you may have other trips like seeking money.

00:04:47.012 --> 00:04:51.367
You may have other things like going to drugs,

00:04:52.658 --> 00:04:53.849
alcoholism,

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:57.262
livercation, all kinds of things.

00:04:57.997 --> 00:05:01.062
But these things have not given any satisfaction,

00:05:02.395 --> 00:05:03.224
to anyone.

00:05:06.032 --> 00:05:08.032
You have to find out that Absolute,

00:05:09.173 --> 00:05:11.580
without which we are in confusion.

00:05:14.174 --> 00:05:16.174
That Absolute is within you.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.420
That's why Sahaja Yoga

00:05:21.176 --> 00:05:23.830
is as spontaneous thing, is a living thing.

00:05:24.693 --> 00:05:26.996
"Saha" means with, "Ja" means born.

00:05:27.496 --> 00:05:28.916
It is born with you,

00:05:29.544 --> 00:05:30.903
as in a seed

00:05:31.253 --> 00:05:34.579
all the maps of the seed that is going to manifest

00:05:35.955 --> 00:05:38.496
are built-in.

00:05:38.654 --> 00:05:40.654
In the same way within you,

00:05:43.312 --> 00:05:46.619
your Spirit and your Kundalini

00:05:46.777 --> 00:05:51.374
are all already existing there

00:05:51.917 --> 00:05:54.367
and they are just waiting for a chance

00:05:55.786 --> 00:05:57.957
to give you your Self-Realisation.

00:06:00.872 --> 00:06:06.727
Before telling you about the benefits of Self-Realisation,

00:06:08.402 --> 00:06:11.908
I have to tell you that you must keep your minds open

00:06:12.408 --> 00:06:16.530
as you would for any science lecture or any other lecture.

00:06:19.786 --> 00:06:21.786
There's no jugglery

00:06:22.906 --> 00:06:27.446
or there is no shopping, guru shopping in Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:28.886 --> 00:06:31.310
It is a happening, it’s an actualisation.

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:35.447
It is within you. It’s a living force,

00:06:35.947 --> 00:06:40.687
like a flower becomes a fruit

00:06:42.084 --> 00:06:45.059
or an egg becomes a chick,

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:49.958
you get your Realisation and you become a different personality,

00:06:49.967 --> 00:06:53.701
a new dimension of awareness grows into you

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.562
and this new dimension of awareness

00:06:57.613 --> 00:06:59.034
is an actualisation,

00:06:59.363 --> 00:07:02.984
it's not just a mere words

00:07:03.484 --> 00:07:07.056
or any kind of a brainwashing.

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:10.564
It is an actualisation within you,

00:07:12.517 --> 00:07:15.140
which happens by which

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.640
you start feeling

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.140
the collective consciousness.

00:07:21.174 --> 00:07:24.680
You are a part and parcel of the whole,

00:07:24.859 --> 00:07:25.994
so many have said it.

00:07:27.541 --> 00:07:28.715
We also believe in it

00:07:28.852 --> 00:07:31.092
that we are the part and parcel of the whole,

00:07:31.677 --> 00:07:34.021
but so far in our awareness,

00:07:34.842 --> 00:07:37.608
in our central nervous system, we have not felt that.

00:07:40.523 --> 00:07:43.166
So this is actually should happen to you.

00:07:47.427 --> 00:07:50.561
In this we have to accept,

00:07:51.531 --> 00:07:56.364
whatever is nourishing for our growth, after Realisation.

00:07:58.018 --> 00:08:00.421
Gradually you started accepting it

00:08:00.921 --> 00:08:02.921
and I'll tell you why it happens

00:08:04.553 --> 00:08:07.286
but the thing is in Sydney I found

00:08:07.786 --> 00:08:10.906
that people are extremely honest about their seeking

00:08:11.406 --> 00:08:14.322
and they really appreciated my honesty.

00:08:18.006 --> 00:08:20.006
This is a process

00:08:20.356 --> 00:08:22.614
which was built in since long within us.

00:08:23.917 --> 00:08:26.210
Here that you see different chakras.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:27.810
Are placed.

00:08:32.964 --> 00:08:35.724
Can you see? All right.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.469
These centres are placed within

00:08:41.228 --> 00:08:42.448
the human beings

00:08:44.225 --> 00:08:46.447
and they exist as subtle centers

00:08:47.896 --> 00:08:50.081
in the spinal cord and in the brain.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.309
These are called in Sanskrit language as chakras.

00:08:58.123 --> 00:09:00.862
These centres exist within us

00:09:01.526 --> 00:09:04.016
as milestones of our evolution.

00:09:04.954 --> 00:09:06.954
For example, the lowest chakra

00:09:07.454 --> 00:09:09.454
called as the Mooladdhara chakra,

00:09:09.954 --> 00:09:11.954
is the center,

00:09:13.786 --> 00:09:17.982
at that point we were carbon atoms. We were matter.

00:09:21.548 --> 00:09:24.763
At that point we were innocent. Matter is innocent.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.925
So the first thing that was created within us was innocence.

00:09:31.264 --> 00:09:33.854
This whole universe was created

00:09:35.376 --> 00:09:37.376
after innocence was created.

00:09:40.139 --> 00:09:42.139
This chakra is placed

00:09:42.639 --> 00:09:45.373
below the Kundalini, if you see it clearly.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.807
Kundalini is the pure power of desire.

00:09:50.654 --> 00:09:52.654
Pure power of desire.

00:09:53.154 --> 00:09:55.356
Whatever is pure we call it Holy.

00:09:56.276 --> 00:09:59.944
Is the Holy power of desire,

00:10:01.302 --> 00:10:03.302
which remains

00:10:05.189 --> 00:10:07.189
dormant.

00:10:11.704 --> 00:10:14.361
This power is the desire

00:10:15.007 --> 00:10:17.794
to be one with the Spirit.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.577
Without knowing the Spirit, you cannot know God.

00:10:24.464 --> 00:10:26.685
You are to be input to the mains.

00:10:28.043 --> 00:10:29.568
You are not yet put to the mains.

00:10:29.612 --> 00:10:31.776
For example, this instrument that we have made

00:10:32.586 --> 00:10:35.215
if it is not put to the mains, it has no meaning.

00:10:36.627 --> 00:10:38.627
So that has to happen.

00:10:39.127 --> 00:10:41.127
It's like the primule in the seed,

00:10:41.244 --> 00:10:43.244
a germinating power

00:10:44.054 --> 00:10:44.812
in the seed,

00:10:45.203 --> 00:10:48.426
that you have got this power, residual power

00:10:49.419 --> 00:10:50.238
sleeping

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.920
waiting for a moment

00:10:53.183 --> 00:10:54.585
when somebody

00:10:55.085 --> 00:10:57.598
who is authorised by the Divine

00:10:57.751 --> 00:10:58.693
and not

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:01.503
by any organization or certificates

00:11:02.788 --> 00:11:04.208
that human beings give.

00:11:05.183 --> 00:11:07.957
But somebody, who himself is a Realised soul,

00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:10.293
as an enlightened person

00:11:10.793 --> 00:11:11.793
and he knows

00:11:13.643 --> 00:11:15.991
what is this power is,

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:20.845
it waits for such a personality

00:11:22.239 --> 00:11:24.239
and then it awakens itself

00:11:24.374 --> 00:11:26.374
and you get your Self-Realisation.

00:11:30.159 --> 00:11:32.159
It has to be spontaneous

00:11:32.258 --> 00:11:36.471
everything vital in life has to be spontaneous.

00:11:38.467 --> 00:11:41.684
The breathing that we have

00:11:42.914 --> 00:11:45.948
is so spontaneously going on

00:11:46.448 --> 00:11:50.535
that we take it for granted till it stops, or till we feel

00:11:52.057 --> 00:11:53.390
that we cannot breathe.

00:11:55.496 --> 00:11:57.496
If you have to go and read books,

00:11:57.613 --> 00:12:01.220
or putting some efforts to breathe,

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.937
then how many of us could

00:12:06.437 --> 00:12:08.955
even exist for more than

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:11.820
say five minutes?

00:12:13.743 --> 00:12:15.743
It is so vital

00:12:16.115 --> 00:12:18.595
is the culmination of our evolution

00:12:20.172 --> 00:12:24.635
and as the whole creation was created by the Divine,

00:12:25.792 --> 00:12:28.848
as you are also created by the Divine,

00:12:29.494 --> 00:12:33.767
this great happening is to be done by the Divine.

00:12:37.552 --> 00:12:39.552
Now some people asked me

00:12:39.625 --> 00:12:42.772
that can it not happen by itself to us.

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:48.537
We do not know that at every stage of our evolution

00:12:49.443 --> 00:12:52.506
some aspect of God had to incarnate

00:12:53.134 --> 00:12:56.232
or some guidance had to come from the Divine,

00:12:58.121 --> 00:13:02.163
to give us a higher awareness.

00:13:03.689 --> 00:13:05.689
But specially at this time

00:13:06.039 --> 00:13:07.419
it is very important

00:13:07.748 --> 00:13:09.748
that somebody has to do it

00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:13.469
because you have reached a stage where,

00:13:14.653 --> 00:13:18.323
you have to know it in words,

00:13:19.101 --> 00:13:21.384
and Divine had to speak.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.795
It's a very common question that in,

00:13:28.804 --> 00:13:30.804
I think people are ego orientated,

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.913
they said, "Why you Mother?" I said you better be there!

00:13:34.584 --> 00:13:37.382
I’ll be very happy if you could do it

00:13:38.117 --> 00:13:41.519
because I am a happily married woman,

00:13:42.233 --> 00:13:44.233
I don't need anything from anyone,

00:13:44.733 --> 00:13:46.733
I have to just give

00:13:47.233 --> 00:13:52.786
but if you can do my work, I will be very happy to retire.

00:13:55.038 --> 00:13:58.083
It's very easy to say, "why you?" I mean you should ask

00:13:58.096 --> 00:14:00.610
God why He gave me these powers?

00:14:01.499 --> 00:14:03.499
But they are there,

00:14:03.731 --> 00:14:07.670
but one need not feel hurt about it so much also.

00:14:07.878 --> 00:14:10.621
After all you have some many powers which I don't have.

00:14:11.121 --> 00:14:13.121
For example, I don't know how to drive,

00:14:13.621 --> 00:14:14.703
really I don't know.

00:14:15.008 --> 00:14:16.209
I don’t know many things,

00:14:16.271 --> 00:14:18.965
even I don't know how to open ordinary cans

00:14:19.587 --> 00:14:22.304
but if I know how to open the Kundalini

00:14:23.023 --> 00:14:25.023
why should it hurt your ego?

00:14:25.913 --> 00:14:27.913
And why should you feel bad

00:14:28.072 --> 00:14:30.824
because I have to really work day in day out.

00:14:32.735 --> 00:14:34.735
To do this work,

00:14:35.868 --> 00:14:37.868
it’s something just a gift to you.

00:14:38.149 --> 00:14:40.149
There is no shopping;

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:42.430
you can't pay for it.

00:14:42.711 --> 00:14:44.170
It is beyond,

00:14:45.157 --> 00:14:47.157
your control.

00:14:47.657 --> 00:14:52.798
To conceive God, you have to see, as the reality is.

00:14:53.955 --> 00:14:55.979
You have to give up your conceptions.

00:14:56.041 --> 00:14:59.158
Supposing I had conceived a hall

00:14:59.658 --> 00:15:01.658
before seeing this,

00:15:01.817 --> 00:15:03.817
I would have had funny ideas

00:15:04.536 --> 00:15:05.981
but after seeing it

00:15:06.019 --> 00:15:08.909
only I really know what it is.

00:15:09.725 --> 00:15:10.898
In the same way

00:15:11.398 --> 00:15:12.702
people have written books,

00:15:13.372 --> 00:15:15.372
thousands of books they have written

00:15:15.872 --> 00:15:18.502
or even millions of books they have written, so what to do?

00:15:19.562 --> 00:15:20.883
If they have written the books,

00:15:20.921 --> 00:15:23.648
have they given you any Self-Realisation?

00:15:26.191 --> 00:15:28.784
Have they given you that experience

00:15:29.284 --> 00:15:31.829
of the absolute by which you know yourself,

00:15:32.329 --> 00:15:35.324
you know your centres and you know the centre of others

00:15:35.824 --> 00:15:38.556
and you start manifesting your own powers.

00:15:40.078 --> 00:15:42.250
You become the master of your powers.

00:15:45.037 --> 00:15:49.449
This is what should be the criteria of your seeking.

00:15:50.776 --> 00:15:55.164
Why should you be identified with anything else but yourself?

00:15:56.564 --> 00:15:57.972
Because I get people

00:15:58.204 --> 00:16:00.279
belonging to this cult or this group

00:16:00.341 --> 00:16:02.341
or this religion or this and that.

00:16:05.249 --> 00:16:07.523
But you must understand

00:16:08.023 --> 00:16:10.023
that you are not here

00:16:10.255 --> 00:16:12.255
to be pleader for any one of them.

00:16:13.023 --> 00:16:15.441
I mean you pay them to be their pleader

00:16:17.133 --> 00:16:20.750
or to be their lawyers or solicitors, whatever you may call it.

00:16:23.342 --> 00:16:26.781
But you should really try to honestly seek the truth

00:16:27.281 --> 00:16:28.992
and ask for this truth

00:16:29.367 --> 00:16:31.367
and then only you will get the truth.

00:16:33.059 --> 00:16:35.059
So first thing one should understand

00:16:35.291 --> 00:16:37.291
that you cannot purchase Divine.

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:40.397
You cannot pay for it, it is an insult,

00:16:41.919 --> 00:16:43.135
it is an insult.

00:16:45.216 --> 00:16:48.387
And secondly you cannot put in effort for that.

00:16:49.228 --> 00:16:50.691
When you have to sprout a seed

00:16:50.704 --> 00:16:52.704
what do you do? You put it in the Mother Earth,

00:16:53.253 --> 00:16:55.720
and she sprouts by itself spontaneously.

00:16:56.439 --> 00:16:57.937
It has got that force in it,

00:16:57.999 --> 00:17:00.198
only you have to put it to the Mother Earth.

00:17:01.306 --> 00:17:03.749
And the Mother Earth by her warmth

00:17:04.249 --> 00:17:06.249
germinates the seed.

00:17:07.333 --> 00:17:09.579
Do you get angry with the Mother Earth for that,

00:17:09.617 --> 00:17:11.224
that, why must you do that?

00:17:13.476 --> 00:17:15.696
If she has to do it, she has to do it.

00:17:16.196 --> 00:17:18.416
Whatever the sun has to do has to do,

00:17:18.916 --> 00:17:20.916
and whatever you have to do, you can do

00:17:21.246 --> 00:17:23.246
and whatever the animals have to do, they do.

00:17:26.665 --> 00:17:28.015
If we understand that

00:17:28.053 --> 00:17:30.621
we have not yet achieved what we wanted to,

00:17:34.308 --> 00:17:36.308
then you will realise

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.100
that there is a very little gap.

00:17:40.792 --> 00:17:42.792
The Kundalini awakening takes

00:17:43.681 --> 00:17:45.320
split of a second,

00:17:46.501 --> 00:17:51.806
but its rising may take more time in certain people

00:17:52.914 --> 00:17:57.470
because of blockages in the centre

00:17:58.311 --> 00:18:01.771
or maybe some imbalances within us.

00:18:04.047 --> 00:18:06.642
In short I will try to tell you

00:18:07.069 --> 00:18:09.625
what is the Kundalini and what is this picture about.

00:18:11.341 --> 00:18:13.341
I hope you have got some books with you,

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.885
you can also open and see for yourself.

00:18:16.385 --> 00:18:19.901
Those who haven't got books can also get from them,

00:18:21.106 --> 00:18:24.520
it will be easier to understand it.

00:18:26.893 --> 00:18:30.576
At the back of the book you will find a nice chart.

00:18:42.485 --> 00:18:45.188
Firstly you have to be honest about your seeking,

00:18:46.393 --> 00:18:49.610
absolutely honest about it then everything will work out.

00:18:53.005 --> 00:18:56.403
Now here you see this chart

00:18:56.903 --> 00:18:58.903
is the first center

00:18:59.403 --> 00:19:01.548
called as the Mooladhara chakra, as I said,

00:19:02.924 --> 00:19:04.030
and the sacrum.

00:19:04.895 --> 00:19:07.186
See the meaning of the word sacrum means sacred.

00:19:08.416 --> 00:19:11.563
Sacrum is the bone in which the Kundalini is there.

00:19:14.204 --> 00:19:16.621
I would like you to see from the top

00:19:18.216 --> 00:19:21.851
this blue color balloon like structure

00:19:22.205 --> 00:19:24.205
comes down up to the first chakra.

00:19:29.011 --> 00:19:30.067
Now this,

00:19:35.238 --> 00:19:39.025
represents a subtle force within us,

00:19:41.082 --> 00:19:43.565
which is the power of desire.

00:19:45.962 --> 00:19:47.962
It manifests outside

00:19:48.462 --> 00:19:50.462
the left sympathetic nervous system.

00:19:52.835 --> 00:19:55.351
This is the emotional side of a human being.

00:19:55.851 --> 00:19:57.180
It is not only emotional.

00:20:01.451 --> 00:20:04.662
This is the one that

00:20:05.162 --> 00:20:07.162
takes conditionings

00:20:09.632 --> 00:20:10.750
within itself

00:20:10.812 --> 00:20:13.834
when we say "Don't do that, don't do that, don't do that"

00:20:18.348 --> 00:20:21.598
and creates by its activity

00:20:22.487 --> 00:20:26.446
a balloon like structure called as superego

00:20:26.946 --> 00:20:28.946
which is in Sanskrit called as mana.

00:20:30.614 --> 00:20:35.346
So this is the power of mana, of manashakti.

00:20:35.769 --> 00:20:37.440
English language is a little

00:20:37.575 --> 00:20:39.575
confused, when you say mental cases

00:20:39.807 --> 00:20:42.353
you do not mean, the mental cases

00:20:42.488 --> 00:20:44.936
that has something to do with the

00:20:45.095 --> 00:20:46.696
mind which thinks.

00:20:47.196 --> 00:20:48.810
But when you say mental cases,

00:20:49.115 --> 00:20:52.399
you mean to say that they are the people who suffer

00:20:52.631 --> 00:20:54.631
from emotional problems.

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.514
It's a little confused thing

00:20:58.233 --> 00:21:00.233
but in psychology

00:21:01.293 --> 00:21:03.613
it is very nicely described by Jung,

00:21:03.699 --> 00:21:05.404
who was a realised soul himself,

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:07.577
the superego

00:21:09.196 --> 00:21:11.541
and the ID part is this

00:21:13.428 --> 00:21:15.769
power by which we

00:21:17.753 --> 00:21:20.311
get all our conditionings within us

00:21:20.665 --> 00:21:22.665
and we pass it to our past.

00:21:23.335 --> 00:21:25.656
Beyond this area on the left-hand side

00:21:26.545 --> 00:21:28.545
lies beyond the subconscious,

00:21:29.459 --> 00:21:32.424
the collective sub-conscious, all that is dead,

00:21:33.386 --> 00:21:36.919
since creation lies this side on the left-hand side.

00:21:37.825 --> 00:21:40.125
This manifests as I told you,

00:21:40.625 --> 00:21:42.625
the left sympathetic nervous system.

00:21:43.125 --> 00:21:44.746
Now in the medical science,

00:21:45.246 --> 00:21:48.439
there is no difference between the left and right.

00:21:49.238 --> 00:21:50.492
But you will find out

00:21:50.586 --> 00:21:54.091
they have entirely two different functions.

00:21:55.296 --> 00:21:57.882
The left sympathetic nervous caters

00:21:58.147 --> 00:22:02.378
to our emotional side which can be proved in Sahaja Yoga practice.

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:07.505
Now on the right hand side,

00:22:08.603 --> 00:22:10.064
there is another power

00:22:10.692 --> 00:22:12.692
which is the power of action.

00:22:13.833 --> 00:22:17.999
When we desire, the desire has to be put into action.

00:22:19.225 --> 00:22:21.944
And this power of desire

00:22:23.213 --> 00:22:25.572
is called the prana Shakti,

00:22:26.414 --> 00:22:28.653
or the power of action

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.580
the kriya Shakti, some people call it

00:22:32.208 --> 00:22:34.208
and it looks after

00:22:34.708 --> 00:22:36.708
our intellectual side,

00:22:37.208 --> 00:22:39.208
our intelligence

00:22:39.473 --> 00:22:42.874
and the mind with which we think about the mental side

00:22:43.972 --> 00:22:45.972
and our physical side,

00:22:46.472 --> 00:22:48.472
through which we go into action.

00:22:54.293 --> 00:22:57.597
This as a result of it’s activity creates

00:22:57.627 --> 00:22:59.755
another balloon you can see there,

00:22:59.785 --> 00:23:01.310
a yellow color balloon

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:04.343
which we call as ego.

00:23:04.843 --> 00:23:06.843
EGO, ego.

00:23:07.749 --> 00:23:12.480
And this two powers meet at a point,

00:23:13.215 --> 00:23:15.215
when a child is about say

00:23:15.715 --> 00:23:18.755
12 years of age, he is completely

00:23:19.255 --> 00:23:20.513
calcified here.

00:23:21.013 --> 00:23:22.649
But in childhood only you see at

00:23:22.679 --> 00:23:25.108
the age of say one year or one and the half year,

00:23:25.245 --> 00:23:27.863
you start feeling the calcification,

00:23:28.021 --> 00:23:30.693
of this soft bone called as fontanel bone.

00:23:32.197 --> 00:23:35.278
In the center is the third power,

00:23:39.603 --> 00:23:44.440
called as the power of evolution.

00:23:46.072 --> 00:23:49.055
The power of sustenance.

00:23:50.431 --> 00:23:52.624
The power of religion

00:23:52.825 --> 00:23:54.269
which is innate within us.

00:23:54.769 --> 00:23:56.769
Now "religo" means a

00:23:58.743 --> 00:24:00.743
capacity, you can say a quality

00:24:02.482 --> 00:24:03.148
like

00:24:05.379 --> 00:24:06.929
gold is untarnishable,

00:24:07.322 --> 00:24:08.623
that is the quality of gold.

00:24:08.888 --> 00:24:10.888
Carbon has four valencies

00:24:11.089 --> 00:24:12.527
that is the quality of carbon.

00:24:13.027 --> 00:24:14.132
In the same way,

00:24:14.205 --> 00:24:17.348
human beings also have got ten sustenance

00:24:18.126 --> 00:24:20.537
and these ten sustenance are

00:24:21.037 --> 00:24:21.942
the dharma

00:24:22.677 --> 00:24:24.828
or the religions of a human being.

00:24:25.328 --> 00:24:28.470
It has nothing to do with outside religions, whatever you believe into

00:24:28.521 --> 00:24:31.355
or whatever you have fallen into or you are born into.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.417
But there are ten sustanances within us,

00:24:35.131 --> 00:24:37.259
which are in this area,

00:24:37.759 --> 00:24:42.165
call as, we call it as Void, but it's not the same void as Zen says,

00:24:43.242 --> 00:24:45.947
but is the visceral cavity

00:24:47.622 --> 00:24:48.749
in this area,

00:24:50.852 --> 00:24:54.162
we develop our sustenance.

00:24:57.055 --> 00:25:00.476
By developing our sustanance only we evolve.

00:25:00.869 --> 00:25:02.956
For example, first a fish

00:25:04.033 --> 00:25:06.913
came out of the water

00:25:08.866 --> 00:25:12.362
and developed a sustenance by it started crawling

00:25:12.413 --> 00:25:14.413
and it became a reptile.

00:25:14.913 --> 00:25:17.507
Firstly only one fish came

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:19.408
and then

00:25:20.335 --> 00:25:22.885
shoals and shoals of fishes started

00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:25.576
coming out of the water.

00:25:26.183 --> 00:25:27.044
So

00:25:28.783 --> 00:25:32.889
the evolution went on like this till we became human beings.

00:25:33.667 --> 00:25:34.982
In this process,

00:25:35.803 --> 00:25:37.204
as you know very well

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:41.249
the left sided and the right sided animals,

00:25:41.279 --> 00:25:44.445
the right sided are the more ambitious, the dominating type.

00:25:44.539 --> 00:25:46.539
The left sided are the sly.

00:25:46.888 --> 00:25:49.039
As you have many nocturnal animals

00:25:49.454 --> 00:25:50.390
they are all left sided,

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:53.830
they're frightened and live in the left

00:25:54.437 --> 00:25:57.013
and those who are aggressive are on the right hand side.

00:25:58.154 --> 00:26:01.313
They were discarded even some vegetables and what you

00:26:01.364 --> 00:26:05.652
call the plants were discarded in the process of evolution.

00:26:06.964 --> 00:26:09.176
And they were thrown on the right and left side.

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:15.573
And God created man in His own image.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:17.900
That means

00:26:20.366 --> 00:26:21.407
man has

00:26:23.559 --> 00:26:25.357
everything that God has.

00:26:25.857 --> 00:26:27.857
If He is the primordial being,

00:26:27.951 --> 00:26:30.886
He is the macrocosm then you are the microcosm,

00:26:31.471 --> 00:26:33.471
you are a cell in His body

00:26:35.103 --> 00:26:37.103
but you are not aware of that.

00:26:37.603 --> 00:26:40.562
There's a difference between awareness

00:26:41.062 --> 00:26:43.062
and just consciousness.

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:46.037
Awareness is an actualization,

00:26:47.584 --> 00:26:48.977
while just to be conscious

00:26:49.028 --> 00:26:52.371
means mentally you believe, rationally you are a conscious, I know that,

00:26:53.192 --> 00:26:55.213
we think we are brothers and sisters.

00:26:58.662 --> 00:27:00.662
Now the centres that are

00:27:02.487 --> 00:27:04.875
placed within. The first one, as I told you,

00:27:05.375 --> 00:27:08.374
is the Mooladhara chakra.

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:12.607
You will be happy to know that

00:27:13.107 --> 00:27:16.079
in the universe Australia is the Mooladhara chakra.

00:27:22.689 --> 00:27:25.099
It's a fact you will know that

00:27:26.005 --> 00:27:28.925
on vibrations if you ask a question you will know.

00:27:29.019 --> 00:27:31.257
Basically you are innocent people.

00:27:36.415 --> 00:27:39.409
You don't know also when you commit sins that this is sin,

00:27:39.482 --> 00:27:41.482
you just do it very innocently.

00:27:42.965 --> 00:27:45.991
You don't do it knowingly, innocently you do it.

00:27:49.312 --> 00:27:52.979
And the center second center,

00:27:53.768 --> 00:27:56.486
is the center called as Swadisthana chakra.

00:27:58.448 --> 00:28:01.521
The first center manifests your pelvic plexus.

00:28:07.884 --> 00:28:11.750
The right side, as I told you manifests the right sympathetic nervous system.

00:28:13.551 --> 00:28:15.907
The centre one manifests your

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:19.511
parasympathetic which is broken, which is not yet complete.

00:28:21.585 --> 00:28:22.905
Whatever you have achieved

00:28:22.939 --> 00:28:25.247
in your awareness as a human being

00:28:25.394 --> 00:28:27.394
is there and there is little gap,

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:30.267
where you have to just

00:28:31.329 --> 00:28:34.130
break through into that, and become

00:28:34.485 --> 00:28:36.992
united with that force.

00:28:40.383 --> 00:28:42.889
Now this second chakra

00:28:43.389 --> 00:28:45.995
is the chakra called as Swadisthana chakra,

00:28:47.041 --> 00:28:48.576
you need not worry about the names,

00:28:49.076 --> 00:28:52.270
but is the centre for action,

00:28:53.252 --> 00:28:56.520
by which you think, think for the future.

00:28:57.277 --> 00:29:00.009
And this center looks after

00:29:00.911 --> 00:29:01.888
many other

00:29:05.231 --> 00:29:07.377
visras or you can say organs within us.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.037
It looks after your liver.

00:29:11.163 --> 00:29:14.140
All attention is looked after by this centre.

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:17.910
Liver, then it looks after

00:29:18.539 --> 00:29:20.928
your pancreas, your spleen,

00:29:21.428 --> 00:29:22.385
your kidneys

00:29:23.688 --> 00:29:26.207
and uterus in the women.

00:29:29.036 --> 00:29:31.117
The most important function of

00:29:31.167 --> 00:29:34.059
this centre is to manifest the aortic plexus,

00:29:35.924 --> 00:29:39.318
in the gross and to convert

00:29:40.493 --> 00:29:42.493
the fat cells of the stomach

00:29:43.732 --> 00:29:46.042
to replace the fat cells of the brain

00:29:47.602 --> 00:29:49.602
because after all the fat cells

00:29:50.921 --> 00:29:55.124
of the brain are to be replaced because you think, think, think, think

00:29:55.158 --> 00:29:56.636
and go mad with thinking.

00:29:57.409 --> 00:29:58.733
You think so much

00:29:59.121 --> 00:30:00.929
that as if two horns

00:30:01.027 --> 00:30:02.481
are coming out of your thinking.

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:07.324
You may say the other day that "Mother,

00:30:07.744 --> 00:30:10.357
mind is very important because

00:30:10.776 --> 00:30:12.127
mind is the problem."

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:17.341
Don't you know that this mind is limited?

00:30:18.002 --> 00:30:19.698
This rationality is limited.

00:30:20.535 --> 00:30:22.229
You have to go to unlimited.

00:30:23.066 --> 00:30:25.257
When I have to come to this hall,

00:30:25.339 --> 00:30:26.898
we had to leave the car outside.

00:30:28.458 --> 00:30:31.208
This mind can go up to a point and if you

00:30:31.258 --> 00:30:32.712
try to go beyond that,

00:30:32.955 --> 00:30:34.955
then you really go crazy.

00:30:36.563 --> 00:30:38.563
We don't bring the cars inside,

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.300
in the same way this mind

00:30:42.688 --> 00:30:44.817
cannot take you to the unlimited.

00:30:45.879 --> 00:30:48.924
It’s a limited thing, you have to go beyond the mind.

00:30:53.761 --> 00:30:57.073
This centre is doing this work

00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:01.072
of supplying the fat cells and when you think too much,

00:31:01.668 --> 00:31:05.816
all other visaras or all other organs are

00:31:07.665 --> 00:31:10.828
not looked after, are neglected by which

00:31:12.179 --> 00:31:17.026
the person who thinks too much

00:31:17.847 --> 00:31:20.449
who lives in the future, who plans too much,

00:31:22.025 --> 00:31:25.782
also then drinks, in addition to that, supposing,

00:31:26.796 --> 00:31:28.363
and in addition to that

00:31:29.104 --> 00:31:30.880
he does other things like

00:31:30.914 --> 00:31:33.605
drug taking in the stomach and eats lots of fat food

00:31:33.623 --> 00:31:36.615
and all that, so he really finishes that poor liver.

00:31:38.978 --> 00:31:41.800
And that liver is the one that sorts out

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:45.285
all your poisons in the body, all kinds of poison.

00:31:46.909 --> 00:31:50.532
But this liver gets out of order

00:31:50.903 --> 00:31:53.924
and you don't feel it, only the heat starts accumulating,

00:31:54.777 --> 00:31:56.600
you feel always nauseating

00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:59.967
and you feel so unhappy, you don't want to face the present,

00:32:00.162 --> 00:32:01.321
you want to run away.

00:32:01.532 --> 00:32:03.532
You feel extremely horrid

00:32:03.871 --> 00:32:05.871
you don't know what to do with yourself.

00:32:05.937 --> 00:32:07.937
All that comes from a bad liver.

00:32:10.975 --> 00:32:13.521
Also apart from liver

00:32:14.471 --> 00:32:15.209
your

00:32:17.444 --> 00:32:18.767
pancreas goes

00:32:19.267 --> 00:32:22.141
out and you develop a disease called diabetes.

00:32:23.589 --> 00:32:26.741
With that you also try some coffee and all those things,

00:32:27.434 --> 00:32:28.108
which add up.

00:32:28.608 --> 00:32:30.608
I mean coffee, the amount of coffee

00:32:30.638 --> 00:32:33.108
people consumes, sometimes I can't understand.

00:32:34.861 --> 00:32:38.370
And that coffee can really spoil the pancreas

00:32:38.528 --> 00:32:39.502
to such an extent

00:32:40.499 --> 00:32:41.786
that you can develop

00:32:42.457 --> 00:32:44.966
even more serious diseases

00:32:45.155 --> 00:32:47.155
than diabetes of the pancreas.

00:32:47.655 --> 00:32:50.877
Beyond the pancreas lies the spleen.

00:32:52.014 --> 00:32:55.690
Spleen is the real victim of modern people,

00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:58.870
real victim is poor spleen.

00:32:59.603 --> 00:33:03.541
Spleen is the one which is the speedometer within us,

00:33:04.041 --> 00:33:06.041
it regulates your speed.

00:33:07.986 --> 00:33:10.607
When you are eating your food,

00:33:11.495 --> 00:33:13.169
you suddenly open the news

00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:16.265
on the TV or something, horrible things happen.

00:33:16.765 --> 00:33:19.342
You get so shocked and emergencies built-in,

00:33:19.842 --> 00:33:23.041
the spleen is already the busy producing RBC’s,

00:33:23.184 --> 00:33:26.523
red corpuscles for the digestion of the food,

00:33:27.769 --> 00:33:29.994
and suddenly it has another emergency, and

00:33:30.028 --> 00:33:32.513
a third emergency. The way we take our breakfast,

00:33:33.433 --> 00:33:36.107
half sandwich in the mouth and half

00:33:37.338 --> 00:33:38.334
outside

00:33:38.725 --> 00:33:42.351
stepping into the car, telling your wife that do this, do that

00:33:42.851 --> 00:33:46.305
and then rush through the rat race,

00:33:46.929 --> 00:33:48.337
ending up yourself

00:33:48.837 --> 00:33:52.767
into a very crazy spleen.

00:33:52.956 --> 00:33:54.594
The spleen does not know

00:33:55.685 --> 00:33:58.581
how to carry on with your telescopic behavior

00:33:59.501 --> 00:34:01.501
and it go so very crazy

00:34:02.001 --> 00:34:05.343
that it starts producing crazy cells

00:34:05.843 --> 00:34:07.843
and these are the crazy cells

00:34:08.343 --> 00:34:10.218
which create ultimately

00:34:10.314 --> 00:34:13.095
a very serious disease called blood cancer.

00:34:15.398 --> 00:34:17.325
The other day somebody asked me a question,

00:34:17.334 --> 00:34:20.011
"Mother, how the children get blood cancer?"

00:34:21.088 --> 00:34:23.694
I said if I tell you you shouldn’t be angry with me,

00:34:24.194 --> 00:34:27.007
but when we are after the life of our children,

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.778
poor things, they are small children.

00:34:29.406 --> 00:34:31.796
We are trying to make them good citizens.

00:34:57.189 --> 00:35:00.481
So this crazy spleen, becomes

00:35:02.199 --> 00:35:04.199
absolutely uncontrollable

00:35:04.699 --> 00:35:08.107
it start producing blood cells

00:35:08.457 --> 00:35:12.104
which become malignant. They go at random,

00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:15.629
any time and the malignancy starts

00:35:15.958 --> 00:35:17.958
where one cell becomes very big,

00:35:18.308 --> 00:35:21.307
unique as we are also malignant people sometimes.

00:35:21.593 --> 00:35:23.876
You want to be unique people in the society,

00:35:24.055 --> 00:35:26.642
engulfing everybody, encroaching on other people,

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:29.805
in this competition we want to have everything to ourselves,

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:31.678
and by the time

00:35:33.054 --> 00:35:35.816
you are old, you find your hands are shaking,

00:35:35.848 --> 00:35:38.316
feet are shaking, you can't walk properly

00:35:38.602 --> 00:35:41.100
or you develop diseases like say,

00:35:41.899 --> 00:35:43.899
heart attack, or a stroke.

00:35:46.792 --> 00:35:50.108
This rat race is

00:35:51.014 --> 00:35:53.819
very competitive. Competition for what?

00:35:55.985 --> 00:35:58.290
Everybody should be able to grow

00:35:59.089 --> 00:36:01.089
in relation to others.

00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:04.745
For example, if your nose only starts growing like that,

00:36:05.608 --> 00:36:07.886
not in relation to your body or face,

00:36:07.895 --> 00:36:09.895
what is going to happen to the rest of it?

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:14.642
To be on your own, I’m on my own,

00:36:17.364 --> 00:36:19.364
and then you start growing

00:36:19.693 --> 00:36:22.844
without any relationship or co-ordination with the other

00:36:22.874 --> 00:36:24.511
parts of the society,

00:36:25.011 --> 00:36:26.773
other parts of the world,

00:36:28.064 --> 00:36:29.462
then you become malignant.

00:36:30.817 --> 00:36:34.424
You lose all balance, you don't know what you are doing.

00:36:38.578 --> 00:36:40.578
This is the tragedy

00:36:41.078 --> 00:36:43.419
that when this happens to us

00:36:43.919 --> 00:36:45.550
we are so ego-orientated

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:47.811
that the pangs are not felt

00:36:48.119 --> 00:36:50.653
till you reach a stage, that suddenly you find

00:36:50.811 --> 00:36:54.068
a person goes they you call it in English - "ga-ga",

00:36:54.568 --> 00:36:56.568
American English.

00:36:59.183 --> 00:37:02.034
You find them, they can't talk, I have seen it

00:37:03.111 --> 00:37:05.111
in Paris. Some people,

00:37:05.248 --> 00:37:07.248
not very old, younger to me in age,

00:37:07.748 --> 00:37:09.748
walk into a bus

00:37:09.885 --> 00:37:11.419
and they are talking loudly,

00:37:11.705 --> 00:37:13.705
all sorts of French words

00:37:14.205 --> 00:37:16.205
and I asked what are they doing?

00:37:16.705 --> 00:37:19.784
They said, "Mother they are talking about last war. I said why?

00:37:20.284 --> 00:37:22.693
They said they just go on talking like this, they're gone.

00:37:23.193 --> 00:37:26.592
They are, what did you say, out of the deck.

00:37:30.853 --> 00:37:34.515
Because you are having such a running jump towards the hell,

00:37:36.147 --> 00:37:39.069
that the progress, so called,

00:37:40.457 --> 00:37:45.043
will make our society into very funny people

00:37:45.434 --> 00:37:47.543
who are jittery,

00:37:49.039 --> 00:37:51.715
who are twitching their heads, necks and everything

00:37:52.487 --> 00:37:56.384
and their children are so aggressive,

00:37:57.917 --> 00:38:02.298
that it is impossible to understand why they're behaving like this.

00:38:08.106 --> 00:38:09.438
We have to understand

00:38:09.938 --> 00:38:12.661
that we are part and parcel of the whole.

00:38:14.447 --> 00:38:16.447
And anything that is done

00:38:16.875 --> 00:38:18.947
without the relationship of other

00:38:20.208 --> 00:38:21.208
can create

00:38:23.175 --> 00:38:27.402
tremendous problems for the whole world as it is and it is creating.

00:38:31.308 --> 00:38:34.240
The second centre is very important

00:38:34.269 --> 00:38:36.269
for modern people as I told you,

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:40.995
because when you start thinking too much also,

00:38:41.368 --> 00:38:43.368
what you do is use your right side,

00:38:44.502 --> 00:38:46.502
and the left side gets frozen.

00:38:47.672 --> 00:38:48.805
By improving

00:38:49.975 --> 00:38:51.975
on your thinking processes,

00:38:52.276 --> 00:38:54.277
thinking too much of the future and

00:38:54.288 --> 00:38:56.777
planning and of course most of the plans go waste.

00:38:57.585 --> 00:39:00.263
Such a lost of energy we waste in thinking

00:39:01.288 --> 00:39:05.225
that we find that if we had not thought so much,

00:39:05.345 --> 00:39:07.345
we would not have been that much frustrated.

00:39:09.403 --> 00:39:12.495
The planning also to such an extent

00:39:12.995 --> 00:39:14.194
doesn't help in any way.

00:39:15.093 --> 00:39:17.093
Supposing I have to come to this hall

00:39:17.285 --> 00:39:18.685
and I do not know the way.

00:39:19.185 --> 00:39:20.750
What planning can I have?

00:39:21.268 --> 00:39:23.532
I have just to ask somebody how do you go there

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:25.271
and face as it is.

00:39:26.061 --> 00:39:29.829
Supposing a seed has to grow into a root -

00:39:30.456 --> 00:39:32.456
does it have any planning before hand?

00:39:33.047 --> 00:39:36.200
It does not. What it does is that it faces.

00:39:36.374 --> 00:39:38.374
It's a little cell, and so wise,

00:39:38.657 --> 00:39:41.094
and it knows that there is an obstruction, no use

00:39:41.123 --> 00:39:42.995
fighting with this rock,

00:39:43.495 --> 00:39:44.805
so it goes around,

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:48.296
all soft places it pierces

00:39:48.796 --> 00:39:52.032
and gets itself embedded sensibly and wisely

00:39:52.097 --> 00:39:53.491
and uses that rock,

00:39:53.792 --> 00:39:57.334
uses that rock for the strengthening of the tree.

00:39:59.537 --> 00:40:02.263
So when we try to dominate others,

00:40:02.763 --> 00:40:07.018
I mean the sophisticated, the more sophisticated you get,

00:40:07.518 --> 00:40:11.227
the more sophisticated this ego gets

00:40:12.452 --> 00:40:16.148
and with that sophistication you are very pleased, sorry,

00:40:16.702 --> 00:40:19.686
yes and all those things are there,

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:22.879
but inside a big Mr. ego is developing,

00:40:23.687 --> 00:40:26.565
like a balloon. And it presses down

00:40:27.427 --> 00:40:29.100
your superego,

00:40:31.393 --> 00:40:33.015
and it comes down.

00:40:33.805 --> 00:40:36.130
Now the gap that is between the two

00:40:36.286 --> 00:40:38.323
or the place where it should be is not there

00:40:39.366 --> 00:40:41.710
and ego presses down the superego,

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:45.092
till superego starts seeing

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:48.515
the colossal ego.

00:40:49.993 --> 00:40:53.720
And then such a person takes to escapes,

00:40:54.129 --> 00:40:55.586
it takes to alcohol,

00:40:55.742 --> 00:40:57.742
which gives rise to superego

00:40:58.387 --> 00:41:00.387
or it takes to drugs

00:41:01.286 --> 00:41:03.286
and all kinds of escapes in life

00:41:03.768 --> 00:41:06.683
to run away from his own ego because he can't bear it.

00:41:08.813 --> 00:41:11.083
Now the wobbling starts,

00:41:12.108 --> 00:41:14.108
the ego and superego starts wobbling

00:41:14.499 --> 00:41:19.017
and that's how you get people who are absolutely confused.

00:41:22.198 --> 00:41:24.927
Moreover, to add up to the whole problem

00:41:27.673 --> 00:41:30.231
the modern times are the ones

00:41:31.909 --> 00:41:33.418
that in this confusion,

00:41:35.259 --> 00:41:37.865
last judgment has already started.

00:41:39.307 --> 00:41:41.541
Through your Kundalini awakening only

00:41:41.697 --> 00:41:43.697
you will judge yourself

00:41:44.197 --> 00:41:45.439
and correct yourself

00:41:46.374 --> 00:41:48.717
and you will enter into the kingdom of God.

00:41:51.427 --> 00:41:53.625
These confusions

00:41:55.502 --> 00:42:00.010
actually have led human beings to such frantic

00:42:00.564 --> 00:42:02.564
precarious ages

00:42:03.064 --> 00:42:05.064
that Sahaja Yoga

00:42:05.564 --> 00:42:07.123
had to come on this earth,

00:42:08.348 --> 00:42:11.415
to solve the problems once for all.

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:14.728
After getting Realisation,

00:42:14.775 --> 00:42:17.280
it's so remarkable when you find your absolute

00:42:17.345 --> 00:42:19.345
through Kundalini awakening

00:42:19.845 --> 00:42:22.974
I have seen people overnight they give up so many things.

00:42:23.474 --> 00:42:25.474
Like I know of an old man,

00:42:27.061 --> 00:42:29.205
very old man, in Singapore

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:31.470
who is very well known, very rich man

00:42:31.535 --> 00:42:33.535
and a very well known personality,

00:42:36.046 --> 00:42:38.486
and he got his Realisation

00:42:38.587 --> 00:42:41.044
and he told me that overnight,

00:42:41.164 --> 00:42:42.855
"I gave up my gambling,

00:42:43.101 --> 00:42:44.824
I gave up my drinking

00:42:45.197 --> 00:42:47.709
and I gave up my racing".

00:42:49.713 --> 00:42:51.713
These are also escapes in life,

00:42:51.959 --> 00:42:53.959
these are all escapes

00:42:55.057 --> 00:42:57.057
because we are so bored of ourselves.

00:42:57.122 --> 00:42:58.848
Imagine a person is imprisoned.

00:43:00.492 --> 00:43:02.767
If he is just imprisoned in a nice place,

00:43:02.814 --> 00:43:05.144
he should not feel upset. After all

00:43:05.191 --> 00:43:06.893
it's a very good thing to face yourself,

00:43:06.904 --> 00:43:08.904
that's the most beautiful thing we have.

00:43:10.382 --> 00:43:13.395
But because we are so frightened of ourselves only,

00:43:13.895 --> 00:43:16.712
that we don't want to be left alone, we think that we are lonely.

00:43:18.444 --> 00:43:20.444
We want to run away from ourselves.

00:43:21.343 --> 00:43:22.724
We want to have somebody else is

00:43:22.753 --> 00:43:25.652
better to have somebody else, and even when somebody else comes in,

00:43:25.772 --> 00:43:27.772
we do not want to face him squarely

00:43:28.544 --> 00:43:30.544
but we want to have something in between,

00:43:30.645 --> 00:43:32.645
like a bottle of beer or something.

00:43:35.409 --> 00:43:39.047
After Realisation you first time start enjoying each other.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.122
You first time start feeling the vibrations on another person

00:43:43.622 --> 00:43:46.840
and you really enjoy the beauty of another person's

00:43:47.177 --> 00:43:49.377
through this cool breeze that is coming

00:43:49.497 --> 00:43:51.497
out of the being of that person.

00:43:53.338 --> 00:43:55.338
And this should happen to all of you.

00:43:56.109 --> 00:43:58.109
You all should achieve it,

00:43:58.537 --> 00:44:01.692
it's very important because you are out and out seekers.

00:44:02.065 --> 00:44:04.138
But first you must have your self-estimation.

00:44:04.837 --> 00:44:07.181
You must know that you are not here to play

00:44:07.681 --> 00:44:09.681
these games with yourself.

00:44:10.181 --> 00:44:12.181
All kinds of games are available.

00:44:12.246 --> 00:44:13.956
The industries have provided,

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:16.220
the Industrial Revolution has provided,

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:19.870
all modern thinkers and the books and all that have got it

00:44:20.116 --> 00:44:23.747
and to add it gurus have come from India to supply

00:44:24.809 --> 00:44:26.211
this demand market.

00:44:27.309 --> 00:44:28.989
So the picture is complete.

00:44:30.177 --> 00:44:33.511
This should not upset,

00:44:34.953 --> 00:44:39.603
because behind all fakeness and falsehood there has to be the reality.

00:44:40.701 --> 00:44:42.989
If you see thousands of

00:44:43.489 --> 00:44:47.296
artificial flowers you must know there has to be one real rose.

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:52.712
And in the same way behind all this falsehood

00:44:54.516 --> 00:44:57.764
and confusion there is reality

00:44:57.938 --> 00:44:59.938
which is so beautiful within yourself

00:45:00.637 --> 00:45:03.098
which you have to achieve through Kundalini awakening.

00:45:03.815 --> 00:45:06.641
In short now I will tell you about the other centres

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.960
because if you go through this book

00:45:09.605 --> 00:45:10.504
you will know

00:45:10.624 --> 00:45:13.456
about the names and things but in short I can tell you.

00:45:14.065 --> 00:45:15.367
That the third centre

00:45:15.523 --> 00:45:17.161
is the centre of our seeking

00:45:18.259 --> 00:45:20.997
is the center by which we are seeking,

00:45:21.351 --> 00:45:23.351
is the navel centre is

00:45:23.997 --> 00:45:27.225
by which amoeba, an amoeba felt hungry,

00:45:27.725 --> 00:45:31.043
he was seeking food. In seeking food only

00:45:31.543 --> 00:45:33.817
we went up to the stage of

00:45:34.554 --> 00:45:37.104
say mammoth and all these big animals.

00:45:37.221 --> 00:45:39.221
But they were such unwieldly big things

00:45:39.867 --> 00:45:41.867
that they could not maintain themselves.

00:45:42.221 --> 00:45:44.492
So then the intelligent animals came in.

00:45:44.773 --> 00:45:45.861
In that also

00:45:46.051 --> 00:45:48.051
some of them were very horrid ones

00:45:48.223 --> 00:45:49.731
like foxes and all that.

00:45:50.869 --> 00:45:53.712
Then very powerful animals came up

00:45:53.848 --> 00:45:55.848
who had more physical power

00:45:56.057 --> 00:45:58.057
than their big body.

00:45:58.247 --> 00:46:00.247
Like that we develop

00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:03.678
with this seeking up to a point when we became really human beings

00:46:04.324 --> 00:46:06.563
and when we became human beings

00:46:06.717 --> 00:46:10.440
we started seeking things like possessions;

00:46:11.141 --> 00:46:14.191
if not possession, like power,

00:46:14.545 --> 00:46:20.554
in politics, economics, social work, social things

00:46:21.236 --> 00:46:23.236
and lastly, the Spirit.

00:46:24.665 --> 00:46:27.501
Spirit is the solution for all of them.

00:46:29.822 --> 00:46:33.443
Without the light you cannot see anything in this world.

00:46:34.781 --> 00:46:37.647
I cannot see you without any light in there.

00:46:37.965 --> 00:46:43.671
To me, in darkness you are nothing but darkness. I don't see it.

00:46:44.936 --> 00:46:46.936
I cannot relate one to another.

00:46:47.108 --> 00:46:51.131
I do not know who are sitting here and listening to me,

00:46:52.232 --> 00:46:55.681
but once there is light you can see everything clearly,

00:46:56.181 --> 00:46:57.961
and that's what it is, happens.

00:46:58.097 --> 00:47:00.097
That when you get your enlightenment

00:47:00.597 --> 00:47:03.268
you become the master of yourself.

00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:08.238
This is the end of the seeking which starts.

00:47:08.738 --> 00:47:11.441
In this seeking only, around the seeking

00:47:11.941 --> 00:47:15.512
are our sustenance’s are developed gradually

00:47:15.775 --> 00:47:17.902
and ultimately we become human beings.

00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:20.715
And for human beings there are ten sustenance’s

00:47:21.106 --> 00:47:23.106
described in the Ten Commandments.

00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:25.260
When I talk about Ten Commandments,

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.687
a one gentleman got very angry and said "You are

00:47:27.713 --> 00:47:29.713
a Christian, you are a Christian, you are a Christian!"

00:47:31.634 --> 00:47:33.634
But Ten Commandments were written

00:47:33.861 --> 00:47:36.375
when there were Jews, they were not written,

00:47:36.474 --> 00:47:38.745
Moses was not a Christian, he was a Jew

00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:40.516
and the Jew got angry with me

00:47:40.706 --> 00:47:42.196
that I was a Christian.

00:47:43.643 --> 00:47:44.899
Moses, Abraham,

00:47:46.638 --> 00:47:48.638
Confucius, Socrates,

00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:53.679
Mohammed, Nanak, Janak,

00:47:54.398 --> 00:47:56.984
Lao Tse, these are the

00:47:58.176 --> 00:48:00.176
Primordial masters.

00:48:01.204 --> 00:48:04.056
The principle of primordial masters, the Adi-Gurus

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:06.122
who incarnated on this earth

00:48:06.695 --> 00:48:10.229
to teach us how to keep our sustenance.

00:48:11.075 --> 00:48:15.275
They taught against all strong alcohols and strong things.

00:48:15.593 --> 00:48:17.593
Christ did not talk

00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:19.956
but it does not mean that when He said

00:48:19.982 --> 00:48:21.982
He converted into wine, means He

00:48:22.045 --> 00:48:23.239
fermented the wine.

00:48:23.287 --> 00:48:25.739
You cannot ferment the wine in a minute, you understand that.

00:48:27.241 --> 00:48:30.238
Wine is a very common word, even today if you go

00:48:30.738 --> 00:48:33.122
will find that wine means

00:48:34.187 --> 00:48:35.854
grapes. I mean even

00:48:36.354 --> 00:48:38.354
a creeper of the grape is called a wine,

00:48:38.599 --> 00:48:40.599
even the juice of he thing is called wine.

00:48:40.935 --> 00:48:42.945
Now to differentiate we are starting to call it

00:48:42.971 --> 00:48:44.971
grape juice. But it is very, very

00:48:44.979 --> 00:48:46.403
loose, but you will be surprised it is a very

00:48:46.557 --> 00:48:49.946
... About fifty years back people must have started or something like that

00:48:50.191 --> 00:48:53.145
in India, but may be abroad, I don't know.

00:48:53.261 --> 00:48:57.437
Even today many people call it a wine "raksasia",

00:48:57.736 --> 00:49:00.592
even in Indian language it is called as the wine.

00:49:00.873 --> 00:49:03.409
Any grape juice is called as a wine.

00:49:05.134 --> 00:49:07.647
So there are many other things

00:49:07.727 --> 00:49:09.310
which these people told us

00:49:09.463 --> 00:49:12.297
that you should not do, to keep yourself in the centre.

00:49:13.766 --> 00:49:18.071
Now I divide our mistakes into categories.

00:49:20.637 --> 00:49:23.779
The first mistake we have is not to believe

00:49:24.041 --> 00:49:25.598
that God Almighty

00:49:26.098 --> 00:49:28.098
is going to look after our well-being.

00:49:29.183 --> 00:49:31.183
Krishna has said very clearly

00:49:31.409 --> 00:49:33.700
that Yoga kshemam Vahaamyaham. Meaning

00:49:33.725 --> 00:49:36.563
after Yoga, after union with God,

00:49:37.063 --> 00:49:39.063
I will look after your well being.

00:49:41.281 --> 00:49:43.281
That means you should get connected.

00:49:43.544 --> 00:49:45.781
Supposing I am not an Australian citizen

00:49:45.897 --> 00:49:48.245
why will Australian Government look after me?

00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:52.588
In the same way if you are not the members

00:49:52.997 --> 00:49:54.570
of God's community

00:49:54.834 --> 00:49:57.826
or if you are not entered into the Kingdom of God

00:49:58.144 --> 00:50:00.326
or if you are not a citizen of His Kingdom,

00:50:01.173 --> 00:50:04.194
it is not His responsibility to look after your well being.

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:08.422
I mean of course He has created you, so He looks after you.

00:50:09.269 --> 00:50:14.570
But otherwise it's not certain that He'll look after you.

00:50:18.196 --> 00:50:21.270
People demand so much from God,

00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:23.402
they think they are already connected.

00:50:24.085 --> 00:50:27.858
They treat Him as if you can find Him somewhere under the stone.

00:50:29.290 --> 00:50:31.675
They go on demanding please look after my son,

00:50:31.718 --> 00:50:33.718
please do this, praying morning till evening,

00:50:34.218 --> 00:50:35.325
I mean it's pestering.

00:50:36.666 --> 00:50:38.425
When you are not connected with God,

00:50:39.218 --> 00:50:40.493
if you go on

00:50:40.993 --> 00:50:43.304
doing like this to any human being also,

00:50:43.658 --> 00:50:44.669
you'll get arrested.

00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:50.705
And that's what happens, that we live under myths:

00:50:50.711 --> 00:50:54.248
"Oh I have been praying and God has given me this,

00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:57.680
and I have been doing this."

00:50:57.778 --> 00:50:59.778
But we don't see, do we deserve it?

00:51:01.174 --> 00:51:04.839
Are we the Spirit? Have we tried to be the Spirit?

00:51:05.339 --> 00:51:08.837
We have done all kinds of things but to be the Spirit.

00:51:09.611 --> 00:51:12.983
When you are the Spirit then you are really blessed -

00:51:13.483 --> 00:51:14.370
really blessed,

00:51:15.748 --> 00:51:17.748
not only by His powers

00:51:18.047 --> 00:51:20.047
but you become the master of your being,

00:51:20.456 --> 00:51:23.340
and you start manifesting your own powers.

00:51:26.052 --> 00:51:28.777
This seeking and the surrounding dharma

00:51:29.515 --> 00:51:31.715
which is looked after by the Primordial masters

00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:36.424
is another centre here, above that is the centre

00:51:37.143 --> 00:51:39.143
of the Mother of the Universe,

00:51:39.204 --> 00:51:40.869
who gives us the security.

00:51:43.698 --> 00:51:45.805
This one when spoiled

00:51:45.982 --> 00:51:48.305
the security, the sense of security spoiled

00:51:48.591 --> 00:51:49.844
especially among women,

00:51:50.344 --> 00:51:53.522
when they feel that their husband are negligent or they are

00:51:54.214 --> 00:51:57.149
flirting with other women and all sorts of things.

00:51:57.756 --> 00:51:59.972
Then this centre goes but of order.

00:52:01.006 --> 00:52:03.006
When this centre goes out of order,

00:52:03.506 --> 00:52:07.466
then they develop diseases like breast cancer.

00:52:10.701 --> 00:52:11.842
Breast cancer

00:52:11.872 --> 00:52:15.250
is more common in societies where they have divorces.

00:52:16.605 --> 00:52:18.778
I have given a regular speech on this

00:52:18.893 --> 00:52:21.566
which you should get from Sydney and you will know all about it.

00:52:22.515 --> 00:52:24.814
Now the right side heart which you see here

00:52:25.164 --> 00:52:27.164
is the centre of a Father,

00:52:27.728 --> 00:52:30.076
the left one is the centre of the Mother.

00:52:32.777 --> 00:52:36.596
The right side heart centre catches when as a father

00:52:36.904 --> 00:52:38.501
you have not done your duties

00:52:39.108 --> 00:52:41.448
or if your father has died very early,

00:52:42.162 --> 00:52:45.134
you were shocked, then also it can happen.

00:52:45.997 --> 00:52:48.854
Anorexia and all these diseases can also be

00:52:49.076 --> 00:52:51.359
caused by this kind of happenings

00:52:51.859 --> 00:52:53.837
or also asthma.

00:52:54.102 --> 00:52:56.726
Asthma is invariably is caused

00:52:57.226 --> 00:52:59.226
by this centre going out of order.

00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:04.102
The left side is the centre of the Mother,

00:53:05.029 --> 00:53:07.266
our father and mother we chose.

00:53:08.492 --> 00:53:10.492
Before our birth we chose them.

00:53:11.056 --> 00:53:13.728
It was foolish to choose horrible parents.

00:53:14.378 --> 00:53:15.701
But you better pay for it.

00:53:17.718 --> 00:53:19.226
In one lifetime

00:53:19.534 --> 00:53:21.858
it is better to pay for the horrible ones

00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:24.080
so that next time you won't have them again.

00:53:26.973 --> 00:53:29.715
But we are not to judge them.

00:53:30.215 --> 00:53:31.948
If they are not seekers

00:53:31.999 --> 00:53:34.191
it's a very difficult thing to live with them, I know.

00:53:35.012 --> 00:53:37.012
It's very difficult to live with parents

00:53:37.106 --> 00:53:38.846
who are morning till evening

00:53:38.898 --> 00:53:42.409
counting every penny, counting every tin which are emptied,

00:53:42.653 --> 00:53:46.206
every tube that is emptied, they store up,

00:53:46.514 --> 00:53:47.953
they are so materialistic

00:53:48.453 --> 00:53:51.889
and you just can't bear such people, I can quite understand.

00:53:52.389 --> 00:53:55.024
Even a wife could be like that, and a husband could be like that,

00:53:55.182 --> 00:53:57.182
extremely materialistic, you will be fed up.

00:53:57.682 --> 00:54:01.403
They write down everything, every lamp post they must know,

00:54:02.651 --> 00:54:04.908
count everything.

00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:07.324
Today a lady who interviewed me asked me,

00:54:07.503 --> 00:54:10.500
"How many people, Mother, have you given Realisation

00:54:10.829 --> 00:54:12.894
and how many people you have cured."

00:54:12.988 --> 00:54:15.357
I said "You better ask the sun first of all

00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:18.233
how many leaves it has made green, then talk to me."

00:54:22.066 --> 00:54:23.819
I never write any accounts,

00:54:23.885 --> 00:54:26.853
leave alone of human beings, even of money.

00:54:27.353 --> 00:54:28.986
I never write, I have no time,

00:54:29.016 --> 00:54:31.589
I have no understanding as how to write accounts.

00:54:31.619 --> 00:54:34.727
Next life maybe I will be an accountant, for your information.

00:54:38.774 --> 00:54:43.065
So this happens to us when we become

00:54:44.591 --> 00:54:47.101
against our parents.

00:54:47.601 --> 00:54:50.373
I don't say that you should carry on

00:54:50.638 --> 00:54:52.690
with mad people, there's no use

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:55.855
asking the bull to come and hit you, is correct.

00:54:56.355 --> 00:54:58.077
But you need not judge them,

00:54:58.171 --> 00:54:59.594
you can leave them, stay away

00:54:59.667 --> 00:55:01.667
and do not have them in your life, it's alright.

00:55:02.466 --> 00:55:04.848
But if you are taking

00:55:05.113 --> 00:55:08.235
interest in them as well as fighting with them morning till evening,

00:55:08.372 --> 00:55:10.051
then you catch on this heart chakra.

00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:15.405
I would say that in this respect Indians are sensible people.

00:55:16.482 --> 00:55:19.958
They are very sensible that they keep their parents all right.

00:55:20.565 --> 00:55:22.180
And the parents are also yet

00:55:22.324 --> 00:55:24.808
very sensible people. They love their children, they give

00:55:24.817 --> 00:55:26.817
everything that they have to the children,

00:55:26.954 --> 00:55:32.610
and children start really loving their parents,

00:55:32.768 --> 00:55:34.768
till they die they look after them.

00:55:36.272 --> 00:55:38.726
The result of that is of course very bad,

00:55:39.226 --> 00:55:42.613
because here in all the western countries the parents

00:55:42.814 --> 00:55:45.638
are still in a bridal mood, I mean they are brides

00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:48.330
and the bridegrooms you see

00:55:48.830 --> 00:55:52.048
they never become old enough to be parents.

00:55:52.079 --> 00:55:53.926
Seen even an eighty year old man you will find

00:55:53.934 --> 00:55:56.104
marry an eighteen year old girl. I mean

00:55:56.155 --> 00:55:58.155
it's a thing going on all the time. God knows

00:55:58.655 --> 00:56:00.655
what sort of intelligence is that?

00:56:01.347 --> 00:56:03.839
But with all that happening

00:56:03.997 --> 00:56:05.997
poor children do not know

00:56:06.262 --> 00:56:07.944
which parents to be chosen.

00:56:08.444 --> 00:56:10.766
And the last judgement has started, now what to do?

00:56:11.608 --> 00:56:13.608
Now you place yourself in their places

00:56:13.681 --> 00:56:15.013
and think what would you do

00:56:15.107 --> 00:56:17.277
when you know such crazy parents that today

00:56:17.286 --> 00:56:19.051
they are together, tomorrow they are divorced.

00:56:19.551 --> 00:56:21.421
On the streets they will be kissing,

00:56:21.686 --> 00:56:22.986
hugging each other,

00:56:23.486 --> 00:56:26.798
doing all kind of nonsensical thing. Very embarrassing also,

00:56:27.918 --> 00:56:29.084
and if you ask them where are you

00:56:29.135 --> 00:56:31.135
going they say they are going to the divorce case.

00:56:35.011 --> 00:56:38.587
These kinds of absurdities are taking place and because of that

00:56:39.087 --> 00:56:41.087
children don't want to get birth

00:56:42.313 --> 00:56:44.163
in all these places; England,

00:56:44.190 --> 00:56:46.791
Germany, Switzerland, everywhere.

00:56:47.697 --> 00:56:51.780
The birth rate is towards the minus side.

00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:54.280
In Germany especially, West Germany

00:56:54.566 --> 00:56:56.807
and East Germany of all the things

00:56:56.858 --> 00:57:00.046
people give so much money that a woman if she produces

00:57:00.119 --> 00:57:03.401
three children she earns more money than their Prime Minister.

00:57:03.901 --> 00:57:05.901
But still women don't want to produce.

00:57:06.401 --> 00:57:09.178
They want to be free, independent, they don't want to be mothers.

00:57:09.956 --> 00:57:12.279
As a result this poor India

00:57:12.330 --> 00:57:15.195
has to accommodate for all the children born today

00:57:16.635 --> 00:57:19.921
and we are blamed for over population,

00:57:20.421 --> 00:57:23.057
now what to do? We have to bear the load.

00:57:26.356 --> 00:57:28.961
So also it is your responsibility

00:57:29.354 --> 00:57:31.638
to see if you do not produce children

00:57:31.689 --> 00:57:33.776
at least those who are producing children

00:57:33.977 --> 00:57:37.568
have some compassion for them

00:57:37.726 --> 00:57:39.813
and have some understanding.

00:57:39.843 --> 00:57:42.315
Do not blame them. Oh everybody tells me,

00:57:42.494 --> 00:57:45.141
what about your problem of population.

00:57:46.047 --> 00:57:49.634
I tell them now who is responsible for our population

00:57:51.630 --> 00:57:54.730
because in that country even if you have fourteen children,

00:57:55.230 --> 00:57:57.230
they love all their children that are there.

00:57:58.328 --> 00:58:01.768
They are not so ego-orientated that their hearts are not closed,

00:58:02.759 --> 00:58:04.759
they are not so unemotional,

00:58:05.537 --> 00:58:09.656
anybody who has no child will go to

00:58:09.707 --> 00:58:11.255
all the holy places

00:58:11.926 --> 00:58:14.423
and ask for blessings that they should get children,

00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:16.561
to get a child

00:58:16.570 --> 00:58:20.124
is such a blessing in India and child is such an important thing.

00:58:22.462 --> 00:58:24.869
But the mistake they are committing

00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:27.916
is just the other than yours.

00:58:28.715 --> 00:58:31.015
The mistake in those developing countries

00:58:31.045 --> 00:58:33.898
is that they do not believe that God Almighty

00:58:33.992 --> 00:58:36.777
is the One who is going to look after your well being.

00:58:37.491 --> 00:58:39.693
They don't believe in the power of their Father,

00:58:39.766 --> 00:58:41.927
so they do the crime against the Father or

00:58:41.936 --> 00:58:43.386
you can say the sin against the Father.

00:58:44.121 --> 00:58:46.653
When you don't believe in the capacity of your Father,

00:58:48.499 --> 00:58:51.918
so there is bribery, corruption, all sorts of things going on, you know

00:58:52.183 --> 00:58:55.280
cutting corners and money and all those things go on.

00:58:56.464 --> 00:58:58.205
Still in India I would not say that

00:58:59.111 --> 00:59:02.868
ordinary people are dishonest. I mean our bureaucrats may be, our

00:59:03.090 --> 00:59:06.005
politicians may be and business people may be. But

00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:08.120
ordinary people are very honest in India.

00:59:10.137 --> 00:59:11.386
But this is what happens.

00:59:12.394 --> 00:59:15.027
On the other side, you see supposing

00:59:15.527 --> 00:59:17.928
an Indian comes to your house, be careful

00:59:18.974 --> 00:59:22.447
he may run away with anything that you have in the house, anything,

00:59:22.947 --> 00:59:25.246
see, but

00:59:25.369 --> 00:59:28.181
if an American comes to your house, be careful about your wife.

00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:32.402
He may run away with your wife or with your daughter.

00:59:33.806 --> 00:59:37.329
Or say an Englishman comes he'll do it in a subtler way

00:59:37.829 --> 00:59:38.922
because he's a scholar.

00:59:40.232 --> 00:59:42.998
So he reads some poetry to your wife

00:59:43.310 --> 00:59:45.061
and in the night you find she is missing.

00:59:49.327 --> 00:59:52.381
This is fundamental, I mean the wife

00:59:52.806 --> 00:59:54.938
who runs away like this creates problem

00:59:56.304 --> 00:59:58.304
fundamentally for the household.

00:59:58.992 --> 01:00:00.992
Just think in a house,

01:00:01.361 --> 01:00:05.328
where there are children, there is husband, kitchen

01:00:05.828 --> 01:00:08.610
and all the places, everybody sleeping nicely,

01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:10.596
early in the morning they find

01:00:10.625 --> 01:00:13.844
that the main pole of the house is missing and the whole thing is collapsed.

01:00:14.589 --> 01:00:17.934
What will happen to the children, nobody thinks.

01:00:19.799 --> 01:00:20.943
Nobody understands

01:00:21.443 --> 01:00:24.046
or they think they are being in love

01:00:24.697 --> 01:00:25.842
so they must go.

01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:29.796
Men do the same. I mean there is no difference between men and women.

01:00:31.916 --> 01:00:35.329
But this is the sin against the Mother

01:00:38.428 --> 01:00:41.792
that the women have to be respectable and respected.

01:00:44.213 --> 01:00:47.704
Housewives’ position is within us

01:00:47.752 --> 01:00:49.752
here on the left hand side, nabhi

01:00:51.005 --> 01:00:52.510
and if a housewife,

01:00:52.671 --> 01:00:54.993
the deity of housewife, is not in our house,

01:00:55.079 --> 01:00:57.366
not that the woman but the housewife,

01:00:59.674 --> 01:01:01.674
then our spleen goes out.

01:01:03.568 --> 01:01:06.945
We get, children get crazy,

01:01:07.445 --> 01:01:10.242
why is there in-disciplined. Somebody asked me today

01:01:10.290 --> 01:01:14.971
what happens to the people like who try to kill Reagan?

01:01:15.488 --> 01:01:17.488
I said, ask his mother.

01:01:19.382 --> 01:01:22.465
She must be after the life of the child, morning till evening

01:01:22.965 --> 01:01:26.249
and that's why he's taking action,

01:01:26.372 --> 01:01:28.787
or is a reaction of what has happened to him.

01:01:30.003 --> 01:01:33.391
How do these complications arise

01:01:33.891 --> 01:01:35.891
has a basis in the family

01:01:36.881 --> 01:01:39.807
in the nest, that is your house.

01:01:41.776 --> 01:01:43.776
You have to live in the nest

01:01:44.766 --> 01:01:46.766
as a father and a mother

01:01:47.266 --> 01:01:48.729
looking after your children.

01:01:49.662 --> 01:01:52.309
Children are the most important things

01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:56.160
in the whole world for human beings.

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:02.070
Let the politics go to hell,

01:02:02.156 --> 01:02:04.667
and let the economics take its own course,

01:02:05.167 --> 01:02:06.425
but children

01:02:07.151 --> 01:02:09.957
are to be looked after, that's your primary duty.

01:02:11.719 --> 01:02:13.719
But in India we go to the other end,

01:02:14.012 --> 01:02:16.240
when we start look after our children we don't mind

01:02:16.269 --> 01:02:18.269
selling our countries also in the name of children.

01:02:21.236 --> 01:02:23.236
But we live with two extremes I feel,

01:02:23.265 --> 01:02:24.943
the sin against the Mother

01:02:25.066 --> 01:02:27.066
and the sin against the Father.

01:02:29.543 --> 01:02:31.543
When we sin against the Mother

01:02:32.570 --> 01:02:35.313
as Australians, as I am now an Australian,

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:37.418
let us face what happens to us.

01:02:41.703 --> 01:02:44.877
Absolutely we are emotionally blackmailed by ourselves.

01:02:46.481 --> 01:02:49.606
We torture ourselves, we live with artificial things.

01:02:50.746 --> 01:02:53.651
Like if a wife

01:02:54.151 --> 01:02:56.755
wants to run away with another man

01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:01.109
we will even go to get a honeymoon ticket for her

01:03:01.364 --> 01:03:04.321
because we are very considerate good husbands.

01:03:05.857 --> 01:03:08.671
Same thing with the wives if she finds that the husband

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:10.720
is interested in another woman,

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:12.787
she should not be jealous.

01:03:13.287 --> 01:03:19.181
In Sahaja Yoga this is not very much appreciated.

01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:22.804
Husband has to behave, like a husband. He should make his wife

01:03:22.871 --> 01:03:23.710
run the house.

01:03:24.361 --> 01:03:26.361
And the woman has to be a woman.

01:03:28.236 --> 01:03:30.236
She must see to it that

01:03:30.585 --> 01:03:32.585
no danger is brought to the children.

01:03:33.593 --> 01:03:36.748
We have no business to hurt anyone like this

01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:39.060
and we do not know how much we hurt,

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.560
we give cancers to our wives and husbands.

01:03:42.663 --> 01:03:44.663
We give all kinds of horrible diseases,

01:03:45.031 --> 01:03:47.981
mental tortures we make them mad, by our

01:03:48.669 --> 01:03:50.669
mad, capricious,

01:03:52.450 --> 01:03:57.013
very shallow, understanding of our emotions.

01:03:59.151 --> 01:04:02.000
A one man starts going to another woman,

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:03.906
then he goes to another woman,

01:04:04.086 --> 01:04:05.645
then to ten women he goes

01:04:05.731 --> 01:04:07.445
and then ten men go to ten women

01:04:07.531 --> 01:04:10.882
and end up in a lunatic asylum or

01:04:11.118 --> 01:04:14.886
in the orphanage. I have seen in England we had a neighbor

01:04:15.047 --> 01:04:18.455
who had a very huge house, he died, he was an old man

01:04:18.597 --> 01:04:19.654
and you'd be surprised

01:04:20.154 --> 01:04:22.895
they did not discover his body for one month.

01:04:23.244 --> 01:04:25.694
Because there's no family feeling, nothing,

01:04:26.665 --> 01:04:29.413
even a rat doesn't enter that house. Can you imagine!

01:04:32.757 --> 01:04:35.002
This is what has happened in thinking,

01:04:35.069 --> 01:04:37.747
“I am separated, I am individualistic.

01:04:37.814 --> 01:04:40.941
I am exclusive”. If you are really individualistic,

01:04:41.385 --> 01:04:43.385
if you are really mature, individually,

01:04:44.337 --> 01:04:47.678
then you know the unity much better.

01:04:48.969 --> 01:04:51.610
Then you understand that you are the support

01:04:52.487 --> 01:04:56.970
of the whole because you are so matured.

01:04:58.977 --> 01:05:00.977
No wonder our children are not maturing.

01:05:01.684 --> 01:05:03.684
They are behaving in such a manner.

01:05:04.429 --> 01:05:07.840
We are responsible, we must accept that in our own

01:05:09.206 --> 01:05:12.252
ideas about compatibility and all this nonsense,

01:05:12.262 --> 01:05:14.050
we don’t have in India, we are quite comfortable,

01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:15.945
we are producing children quite all right.

01:05:17.424 --> 01:05:24.001
We have no problems. Why do you run after these capricious,

01:05:24.783 --> 01:05:26.783
these shallow ideas?

01:05:28.771 --> 01:05:30.771
You will be held responsible

01:05:32.213 --> 01:05:36.200
for all these horrible diseases that men and women have got,

01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:38.700
and the children that are going to suffer,

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:43.727
if you have charity, better start it at home.

01:05:45.319 --> 01:05:46.786
Better be charitable

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:49.286
to your own wife and to your own husband.

01:05:49.786 --> 01:05:52.265
Be charitable to your children.

01:05:52.351 --> 01:05:54.799
Don't go by concept of falling in love,

01:05:55.017 --> 01:05:57.017
you'll fall, really and make others fall too.

01:05:58.515 --> 01:06:01.632
It's a concept, just a concept.

01:06:02.132 --> 01:06:05.574
I think some of these horrible people must have given you this concept.

01:06:06.865 --> 01:06:08.335
If you really fall in love

01:06:08.421 --> 01:06:10.421
how do you get up to marry another person?

01:06:11.486 --> 01:06:13.937
You fall, marry another person,

01:06:14.588 --> 01:06:16.588
again ready to marry another person.

01:06:16.655 --> 01:06:18.225
You are holding the hand of a person

01:06:18.291 --> 01:06:20.292
who is suppose to be your beloved or whatever it is,

01:06:20.318 --> 01:06:22.318
and looking at another one.

01:06:23.402 --> 01:06:27.127
This concept is absolutely wrong. You have to grow in love.

01:06:29.906 --> 01:06:31.906
As your own child is

01:06:32.011 --> 01:06:35.173
in the same way is your companion. They are two parts

01:06:35.842 --> 01:06:36.980
of one chariot.

01:06:37.612 --> 01:06:40.261
One is the left and other is the right. They're not

01:06:41.269 --> 01:06:43.269
unequal, they're equal

01:06:43.336 --> 01:06:46.551
but they are not similar, they have their own role.

01:06:46.844 --> 01:06:49.379
And women have to take their role courageously,

01:06:50.350 --> 01:06:52.986
to be the mother, as I always say, look at me.

01:06:53.787 --> 01:06:57.845
I am a Mother and in no way,

01:06:59.136 --> 01:07:01.136
in any way, I cannot think

01:07:01.467 --> 01:07:03.467
I could be anything better than this.

01:07:06.547 --> 01:07:08.848
Now if I start thinking, Oh God,

01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:11.179
I am a Mother all right, but

01:07:11.679 --> 01:07:13.679
I must know how to drive,

01:07:14.650 --> 01:07:18.002
then I'm finished. I must know how to drive a bus,

01:07:18.709 --> 01:07:20.709
I must know how to drive a train!

01:07:21.247 --> 01:07:22.361
What is the need?

01:07:23.690 --> 01:07:25.937
I saw one photographer who came to see me.

01:07:26.098 --> 01:07:27.671
He was supposed to take my photograph

01:07:27.719 --> 01:07:29.719
and whole hands were fill with blisters.

01:07:30.219 --> 01:07:32.260
I said first let me cure your blisters.

01:07:32.289 --> 01:07:33.796
How you are going to take my photograph?

01:07:34.127 --> 01:07:36.999
I said what have you been doing with your, photography?

01:07:37.066 --> 01:07:39.773
No, he said, this, I went to a forest

01:07:39.972 --> 01:07:41.972
and I cut some trees. I said, for what?

01:07:42.321 --> 01:07:45.425
You are a photographer, your hands are soft and deft

01:07:45.869 --> 01:07:48.131
why do you want to kill the deftness of your fingers?

01:07:48.631 --> 01:07:51.561
He said, no we must do other things also. I said, why must you?

01:07:53.172 --> 01:07:55.191
You see the nose doesn’t do the work of the eyes

01:07:55.239 --> 01:07:57.239
and the eyes do not do the work of the ears.

01:07:57.739 --> 01:08:01.069
Why must you do, your hands are all finished! And this is what it is.

01:08:02.887 --> 01:08:05.386
To us we feel that men are great

01:08:05.491 --> 01:08:08.340
so we start saying, "let's do the man's work."

01:08:10.723 --> 01:08:13.253
The man thinks, why "should women be like this?"

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:14.553
You are companions -

01:08:15.222 --> 01:08:18.715
you are eternal companions. You are two

01:08:20.722 --> 01:08:23.249
beautiful wheels of a chariot.

01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:26.540
This is to be grown

01:08:26.758 --> 01:08:28.251
and to be matured within you.

01:08:28.469 --> 01:08:30.201
And when this centre is out,

01:08:30.475 --> 01:08:33.624
you get the problems of this centre

01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:36.415
by which you get asthma, tuberculosis,

01:08:37.932 --> 01:08:39.932
and the breast troubles.

01:08:39.961 --> 01:08:43.567
Men get asthma, very serious asthma and

01:08:43.596 --> 01:08:45.273
other problems of the lungs

01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:48.854
and ultimately, also lung cancer can develop.

01:08:51.087 --> 01:08:53.426
When you work too hard with the right hand side,

01:08:53.474 --> 01:08:56.745
you are ego orientated, that is ego develops too much,

01:08:56.812 --> 01:08:58.812
then your left side is neglected,

01:08:58.841 --> 01:09:01.625
you become unemotional, that time

01:09:01.748 --> 01:09:03.748
your heart gives a signal, you get a heart attack.

01:09:05.321 --> 01:09:07.321
When you do too much sometimes

01:09:07.783 --> 01:09:10.185
you may escape the heart attack, but you may get

01:09:10.290 --> 01:09:11.586
a  brain paralysis.

01:09:15.513 --> 01:09:18.454
We are bent upon destroying ourselves.

01:09:18.577 --> 01:09:22.090
The destruction is going to come from within, not from without.

01:09:23.739 --> 01:09:26.872
Those people who are try to shock you, this will happen,

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:29.507
that the sun is doing this, this is nothing.

01:09:29.856 --> 01:09:32.523
It's all within you, the destruction has started.

01:09:33.023 --> 01:09:36.315
You are facing it because

01:09:36.815 --> 01:09:40.177
you cannot accept it.

01:09:41.449 --> 01:09:42.768
You have to accept

01:09:44.021 --> 01:09:46.047
that this is a challenge, I am not

01:09:46.076 --> 01:09:48.675
going to allow myself to be destroyed by foolish and stupid

01:09:48.704 --> 01:09:49.970
ideas that are around.

01:09:51.638 --> 01:09:54.436
And then in your own estimation and glory

01:09:54.936 --> 01:09:57.811
you will be surprised. After realisation

01:09:57.821 --> 01:10:00.012
you will be enriched but

01:10:00.079 --> 01:10:01.965
without Realisation, I don't know,

01:10:02.051 --> 01:10:05.107
it becomes a lecture and a lecture, just a brainwash.

01:10:05.965 --> 01:10:07.965
That beautiful thing should happen to you,

01:10:08.314 --> 01:10:11.811
and once you find your beauty within yourself,

01:10:11.859 --> 01:10:14.217
overnight I have seen people changed.

01:10:14.868 --> 01:10:16.868
Overnight it happens

01:10:17.368 --> 01:10:20.727
and I hope that will happen to you tonight.

01:10:21.227 --> 01:10:24.472
Today I have talked to you about this centre

01:10:24.972 --> 01:10:27.615
and later on I will be talking to you about

01:10:28.021 --> 01:10:30.438
two other centres which are here and here.

01:10:30.656 --> 01:10:32.656
And the Realisation that takes place,

01:10:33.156 --> 01:10:35.156
out of the limbic area,

01:10:35.373 --> 01:10:37.973
in the fontanel membrane,

01:10:38.249 --> 01:10:40.830
which is called as the Brahmarandra in Sanskrit language.

01:10:41.330 --> 01:10:43.330
Thank you very much. May God bless you.

01:10:44.885 --> 01:10:47.425
If you have any questions you please ask me.

01:10:49.827 --> 01:10:52.690
But questions should be something

01:10:53.161 --> 01:10:55.328
which are helpful, not some sort of

01:10:55.365 --> 01:10:57.222
quarrel. I am not here to quarrel with you.

01:10:57.553 --> 01:11:00.266
If you don't want your Realisation I am not going to force you.

01:11:00.766 --> 01:11:05.105
Please do not plead for any other organisation or any other guru,

01:11:05.605 --> 01:11:08.732
because I am not interested. I am only interested in you,

01:11:09.082 --> 01:11:11.082
I see that sparkle in you,

01:11:11.155 --> 01:11:14.023
that's why I am only interested in you, I'm not bothered about others.

01:11:14.523 --> 01:11:16.975
So you do not try to bring others ideas

01:11:17.176 --> 01:11:19.002
that this guru has said this or this

01:11:19.022 --> 01:11:20.785
one has said that and this is in the book.

01:11:21.647 --> 01:11:24.249
The proof of the pudding is that you haven't got your Realisation.

01:11:24.279 --> 01:11:26.279
If you have got it then you can go out.

01:11:28.403 --> 01:11:30.948
If you are sure you have got it, I don't want to force it on you.

01:11:31.063 --> 01:11:32.784
There's no quarrel about anything.

01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:35.070
There's no election on, nothing.

01:11:35.314 --> 01:11:36.523
You cannot give me anything.

01:11:36.574 --> 01:11:39.638
There's no shopping. It's a temple, you have come for a blessing.

01:11:40.138 --> 01:11:43.091
All right? Now you can ask the questions. Thank you very much.

01:11:53.276 --> 01:11:57.200
Dr. Warren: Any questions?

01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:01.840
What commonly happens at times like this
when Mataji has been speaking,

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:06.560
because of these vibrations
which She is emitting,

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:12.880
you enter the silence,
you become thoughtless.

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:19.760
You find that all the rational things
that you want to ask,

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:24.320
which really only come from our ego,
just quietly sit down.

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:28.960
The noisy radio gets switched off.

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:32.080
And this in fact is what happens
at the time of realization.

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:36.538
You enter the silence.

01:12:36.538 --> 01:12:39.440
Shri Mataji: You must realize there’s nothing
to be frightened about.

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:45.280
The kundalini crosses this point,
and you feel thoughtlessly aware.

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:47.120
This is the first step.

01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:52.107
You are aware, but you are thoughtless.

01:13:17.642 --> 01:13:23.520
Dr. Warren: Most people find it
too time-consuming in this modern life

01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:26.720
to devote enough time
to their Self-realization.

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:29.267
What does Her Holiness suggest?

01:13:29.267 --> 01:13:31.120
Shri Mataji: Firstly, are you realized or not?

01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:33.360
Have you got your realization?

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.120
You have got it.

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:40.800
Now, if you have got your realization,
actually you are in meditation,

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:43.920
you are in meditation.

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:47.280
Now for doing the meditation as they call it,

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:50.720
there’s nothing like doing
but cleansing is needed

01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:53.440
because you have to be on the watch
in the beginning –

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:56.080
how the vibrations are coming,

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.560
if there is a proper flow or not,

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:01.440
what chakras you are catching on.

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:05.040
Moreover your life pattern also changes,

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:10.720
because you do not enjoy the things
that do not give you the real joy

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:12.160
of the Spirit.

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:18.160
And the greatest joy of the Spirit is
that you give light to others.

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:21.840
If you do not give light to others,
you will never be satisfied.

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:27.600
You may feel better
because you are realized,

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:31.760
but the completion of that
or the development of your being

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:34.480
doesn’t take place,
unless and until you come

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:36.640
into collective places.

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:38.880
The best thing will be wherever you are,

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:43.760
you start a little group
and meet there every weekend

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:46.400
or some other time, and meditate.

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:47.680
That would be a very good idea;

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:52.000
then you start feeling the sweetness
and the beauty of another person.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.680
You start seeing it clearly
and enjoying it.

01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:59.840
Then you don’t spend so much time
on other things when you take to it

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:03.360
and you enjoy it; and also you grow.

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:08.400
One lady who got her realization told Me

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.840
that she had become very different,

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:13.200
she didn’t remember the names
of all the things that she had

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:15.280
and the quality of this and that.

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:17.360
She was a sales girl or something,

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:20.080
she had her own business
and she used to sell things.

01:15:20.317 --> 01:15:23.280
"I do not remember all that
and I am not that alert,

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:24.906
I said "What has happened?"

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:28.160
but I am very happy and joyous
and things are selling better:

01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:31.200
I am making a very big profit."

01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:34.800
It’s a fact,
it has happened to so many of them.

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:36.720
That’s the blessing of God.

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:40.720
I am not telling you lies,

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:44.240
you have to see for yourself
how these blessings work out.

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:48.494
And then you will just count
your blessings one by one.

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:59.840
Dr. Warren: The meditation practice
is very simple.

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:01.440
We’ll tell you about it later.

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:02.080
Very simple.

01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:09.360
The point is, as Mataji says,
is to be in meditation – all the time.

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:14.067
And that’s what we have to develop.

01:16:14.067 --> 01:16:16.548
Shri Mataji: Is there any other question?

01:16:16.548 --> 01:16:19.680
Dr. Warren: Any other questions?

01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:22.800
Then Mataji can now give you
all the experience.

01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:28.320
I suggest you slip your shoes off,
just to get your feet first onto the floor

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:32.800
and hold your hands out,
resting them comfortably on your lap.

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:36.787
But most of all, be in a receptive
frame of mind in the sense that…

01:16:36.787 --> 01:16:38.228
Shri Mataji: They are, they are very much so.

01:16:38.228 --> 01:16:40.800
Dr. Warren: Just ask Mother for it.

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:43.360
Just ask Mother for your realization.

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:47.120
It’s a spontaneous thing
so with humility,

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:50.240
just ask Mother for it, nothing else.

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:53.763
She is here as a Mother
to give you the gift.

01:16:57.107 --> 01:17:02.320
Shri Mataji: You just put your both the hands
towards Me just like this

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:07.705
as you would be asking for it
just like that.

01:17:12.302 --> 01:17:13.760
Now close your eyes.

01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:16.320
You have to close your eyes
because when the Kundalini rises

01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:20.000
above the Agnya
there is a dilatation of the pupils

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.360
so you close your eyes,
it’s better.

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:27.268
Can you put off that light?

01:17:27.268 --> 01:17:35.787
Dr. Warren: Can you turn the light around?
But you can just turn it off.

01:17:35.787 --> 01:17:43.520
Shri Mataji: This here. That’s better.

01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:47.623
Just put both the hands towards Me
and close your eyes.

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:10.277
I don’t think he’s got it.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.400
Did you attend a programme before?

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:21.020
Yogini: What's the matter?

01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:23.520
Shri Mataji: He has a little liver.

01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:27.012
Put your left hand on the liver.

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:44.080
You’ve got it.

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:47.520
Are you feeling the cool breeze in the hands

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:52.942
or are you feeling the hot?

01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:01.040
If it is hot,
then put your left hand towards Me

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.960
like this and right hand on your liver.

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:05.588
The liver is here.

01:20:05.588 --> 01:20:08.067
Dr. Warren: Left hand on the liver.

01:20:08.067 --> 01:20:11.600
Shri Mataji: I’m sorry, left hand on the liver.

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:17.840
Right hand towards Me
and left hand on the liver.

01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:22.320
Liver is where he is showing you.

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:26.880
Hand should be like this, towards Me,
like this.

01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:32.800
A little lower, it is under the rib.

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:34.480
You can move the hand and see.

01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:38.681
Maybe you’ll find it.

01:20:44.115 --> 01:20:58.067
Dr. Warren: Left heart and right Swadishthan.
A little right nabhi.

01:20:58.067 --> 01:21:02.080
Shri Mataji: I would request you not to disturb
people in meditation.

01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:04.320
If you want to go,
you should have gone earlier.

01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:06.800
This is another kind of aggression,
you see.

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:10.560
I mean, nobody was torturing these women,

01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:13.600
but this is just to disturb
the whole people here.

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:17.120
There’s no need to leave the hall
during the meditation,

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:18.720
so you have to leave earlier.

01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:22.880
Be considerate isn’t it.

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:33.840
Now you can put your left hand
towards Me and right hand on the heart.

01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:38.000
No, it’s the other way round.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:43.200
Left hand towards Me
and right hand on the heart.

01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:46.211
Now close your eyes please.

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.880
You can ask the question in your heart:

01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:58.400
"Mother, am I the Spirit."

01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:01.760
Ask this question in your heart.

01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:22.264
Go on asking this question.

01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:31.120
Now say "Mother, please give me
my self-realization."

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:36.240
"Please give me my self-realization"
you have to ask.

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:38.501
"I am a seeker, Mother.

01:22:38.501 --> 01:22:42.381
Give me my self-realization."

01:23:42.868 --> 01:23:46.240
Dr. Warren: It’s good.
A little bit of left heart still.

01:23:49.648 --> 01:23:55.440
Shri Mataji: You must say that "If I have done
any mistakes in my seeking

01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:59.520
or anything else that I have done,
please forgive me."

01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:02.080
You have to ask for forgiveness from God.

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:06.880
"Please forgive me,
because you are the ocean of love and

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:08.960
compassion and forgiveness.

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:12.560
So, oh Lord, please forgive me
if I have made any mistakes."

01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:16.480
Now, while you are saying this
do not build up any guilt within you,

01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:18.960
because that’s very common.

01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:22.800
Just to say that
I do not develop any guilt

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:26.160
because once you say "Please forgive me",
you are forgiven.

01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:29.520
So you should not have any guilt
saying that "I have done this wrong,

01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:32.560
that wrong".

01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:37.680
Say it thrice, very humbly you must say

01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:44.320
that "If I have done any mistakes
or if I have tried to destroy myself,

01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:46.588
oh Lord, please forgive me."

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:02.080
Now, have no guilt.

01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:04.960
Actually, you have to say "I am not guilty".

01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:08.400
You have to say it at least thrice,
clearly, that "I am not guilty",

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:13.600
because Christ has crucified himself
for your sins and for your karmas,

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:15.680
about which I will tell you tomorrow.

01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:19.680
So you just say "I am not guilty".

01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:26.240
Say it thrice,
it will really help you very much.

01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:29.280
You are unnecessarily analyzing yourself,

01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:34.240
and criticising yourself
and calling yourself guilty.

01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:39.840
If you have any shaking
please open your eyes.

01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:41.440
You should not shake.

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:46.080
If you are shaking that means
there is a problem.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:51.872
Now put both hands towards Me.

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:01.040
Start feeling the cool breeze?

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:02.560
Let's see that.

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:05.600
It’s a very subtle thing, very subtle.

01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:09.760
Our attention is on the gross
and the feeling of the cool breeze

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:13.200
that is the cool breeze
of the Holy Ghost

01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:15.360
you have to feel it in your hands.

01:27:44.664 --> 01:27:48.400
Again say "I am not guilty".

01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:52.720
Are you getting the cool breeze now,
in the hands?

01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:05.840
Try to concentrate, closing your eyes,
concentrating on your fingers.

01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:11.704
See if there is any cool breeze coming in.

01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:19.600
If not, you forgive others.

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:23.120
First of all, you forgive others,
go on forgiving

01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:29.200
and then say that "Mother, give me
my realization".

01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:31.280
You must forgive,
you must forgive others,

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:32.960
that’s very important.

01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:42.160
By not forgiving
you are really harming yourself

01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:43.360
and destroying yourself.

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:46.640
Nothing is happening to the person
whom you are not forgiving.

01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:51.111
So just say "I forgive, I forgive,
I forgive."

01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:01.840
Now ask for your realization.

01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:07.080
"Mother, please give me
my self-realization."

01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:53.280
Alright. It’s good.

01:31:01.802 --> 01:31:02.800
Dr. Warren:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:06.707
Very cool.

01:31:06.707 --> 01:31:08.080
Shri Mataji: Just enjoy yourself.

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:09.600
Enjoy. Enjoy yourself.

01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:10.960
Keep your eyes shut.

01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:11.600
It is coming.

01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:15.200
Do not think, please do not think.

01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:16.560
Relax and enjoy.

01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:24.344
Put your hands on your legs and enjoy,

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:32.321
on your lap you can put your hands.

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:39.668
Alright?

01:31:39.668 --> 01:31:46.387
Dr. Warren: Quite good. Good balance.

01:31:46.387 --> 01:31:54.480
Shri Mataji: All of you who are feeling
the cool breeze raise your hands.

01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:55.200
Both the hands.

01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:56.960
Please raise them higher.

01:31:56.960 --> 01:32:02.240
Both the hands, those who are feeling
the cool breeze.

01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:04.960
That is great. What a response.

01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:11.760
Those who are not feeling the cool breeze
can take help from the Sahaja yogis

01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:13.120
who are here.

01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:16.320
Please put your hands down.

01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:19.920
Thank you very much.

01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:30.560
We wanted to see how Melbourne
will work out

01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:35.120
and I would like to come back here again
on Monday evening here.

01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:38.560
I’m going to Sydney
and we’ll be back again

01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:46.165
on Monday evening, same time,
same place, definitely here,

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:50.320
to tell you about the other two chakras.

01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:55.680
Those who have not got realization
should talk to the other Sahaja yogis.

01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:58.805
Please come and stand here,
all the Sahaja yogis please.

01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:03.360
Talk to them and take help from them.

01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:05.120
They can come a little bit later.

01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:06.199
Come along.

01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:14.960
They look just like you,
but they are collectively conscious

01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:17.840
and they know about Kundalini.

01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:27.440
These are the people who are here
and you can talk to them,

01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:30.160
and converse with them
and ask them if you haven’t got

01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:30.960
the cool breeze.

01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:37.280
If you have got it, don't think about it
and tonight you work it out.

01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:40.720
Please, you come along
and talk to these people

01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:44.880
and you will be able to understand
Kundalini better.

01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:52.640
They are Australians,
they know the problems of Australians

01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:56.000
and they have given realization
in my absence.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.240
Only Warren and Terence, both of them,
came from India

01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:02.560
and they gave them realization.

01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:05.680
So just talk to them,
tell them your difficulties

01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:08.960
if you have any,
give them your addresses

01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:12.800
and Monday I will be here
so bring more friends,

01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:18.320
more relatives and more people
and get them their realization.

01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:19.920
Thank you very much, all of you.

01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:20.240
Thank you.

01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:23.200
I hope to see you on Monday
when I am going to tell you

01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:28.640
about two more centres,
that is those of Shri Krishna's and of Christ.

01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:30.160
May God bless you.

01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:35.890
Go through the book and find out
what is to be done.

01:34:39.748 --> 01:34:42.480
Dr. Warren: At the door is a large book.

01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:47.680
We’d really consider it a privilege
if you’d just sign that book

01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:51.280
with your own name and address
because this is really your birthday

01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:55.040
for those people who got it –
your second birthday.

01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:01.040
There is a contact address
here in Melbourne

01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:04.720
which we’ll give you
for those people who want

01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:08.400
to actively develop it
and find out more about it

01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:11.360
but for the time being, just settle in,

01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:14.953
read at the back of the book
where it explains how to meditate –

01:35:14.953 --> 01:35:16.320
it’s very simple.

01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:19.280
But more than anything,
establish your vibrations,

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:24.720
establish your realization
and come along on Monday night,

01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:27.680
Mataji will take you
that extra step further

01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:32.000
but also these centres here,
here and here

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.880
will become more firmly established.

01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:36.320
Hope to see you then.

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:42.320
For those that didn’t feel the cool breeze
or who have any particular problem,

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:45.440
just stay behind here
and we can at least help you.
