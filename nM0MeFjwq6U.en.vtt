00:01:25.571 --> 00:01:31.691
Now we all have realized
by this time,

00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:42.191
within us lies the peace, the beauty,
the glory of our being.

00:01:42.401 --> 00:01:46.281
There's an ocean of all
that.

00:01:47.821 --> 00:01:50.861
We cannot seek it outside,

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:54.821
we have to go within,

00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:58.941
what they call in
the meditative state,

00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:04.151
you seek it, you enjoy it.

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:08.941
Like when you are thirsty,

00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:16.571
you go to a river or you
go to a ocean,

00:02:18.991 --> 00:02:23.401
and try to quench
your thirst.

00:02:23.691 --> 00:02:28.731
But even the ocean cannot
give you sweet water.

00:02:36.611 --> 00:02:39.691
So how can anything
that is spread outside

00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:44.941
give you that deep thing
that is within you?

00:02:45.191 --> 00:02:51.731
You are trying to find it outside,
where it does not lie.

00:02:52.191 --> 00:02:57.281
It is within us, absolutely
with in us.

00:03:00.571 --> 00:03:04.991
It is so simple because
it is your own

00:03:05.191 --> 00:03:08.111
it is within your reach,

00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:11.401
just there.

00:03:11.821 --> 00:03:16.941
What ever you have
been doing

00:03:17.991 --> 00:03:22.731
going out to find
the joy,

00:03:22.941 --> 00:03:27.241
the so called joy,
the so called happiness,

00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:38.281
the so called glory of worldly
powers and wordly possessions,

00:03:40.531 --> 00:03:44.991
you have to reverse it back
the whole thing.

00:03:46.071 --> 00:03:51.191
You have to project
within yourself.

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:55.281
It was not wrong
that you went out,

00:03:55.531 --> 00:03:59.821
it was not correct
that you went out,

00:04:00.531 --> 00:04:05.941
shouldn't feel sorry for what
you have done so far.

00:04:06.571 --> 00:04:10.731
It was not the correct
way

00:04:10.941 --> 00:04:16.901
to get to the real joy
of life,

00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:22.151
the real glory of your
being.

00:04:25.941 --> 00:04:28.151
It has worked in so
many people

00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:34.111
that you have entered into
that subtler understanding.

00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:38.491
Some people are only at a mental
level, maybe, doesn't matter.

00:04:38.731 --> 00:04:44.531
Maybe, some are only at a physical
level that they can feel it,

00:04:44.731 --> 00:04:48.821
doesn't matter. But, you are
on the correct lines

00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:51.991
you are moving correctly.

00:04:52.281 --> 00:04:54.861
Try to meditate,

00:04:55.111 --> 00:04:59.991
meditate more so that you
reach your inner being.

00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:04.191
And this inner being, is the
vast ocean of bliss,

00:05:04.441 --> 00:05:08.321
which exists in
every one of us.

00:05:08.861 --> 00:05:13.941
Is that vast glorifying
flood of light

00:05:14.241 --> 00:05:20.491
that floods everybody's
inner beauty.

00:05:21.941 --> 00:05:24.611
So to approach it,

00:05:24.821 --> 00:05:32.651
you have to go within yourself
by denying things,

00:05:32.821 --> 00:05:37.191
which are against it,
against your movement.

00:05:37.441 --> 00:05:42.861
Sometimes the wind can be
very, very strong for you

00:05:43.151 --> 00:05:47.111
to misunderstand

00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:58.651
that the glory of God
is within.

00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:01.781
The turn back,

00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:11.071
every moment remember that
your movement has to be inward.

00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:17.191
When you move inward

00:06:17.441 --> 00:06:22.821
you forget the ideas of your
outer glories.

00:06:23.111 --> 00:06:27.821
A person, who is of a very
base nature,

00:06:28.031 --> 00:06:30.111
thinks that if he makes
a lot of money

00:06:30.361 --> 00:06:33.901
then he has achieved
joy, but he has not.

00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:36.731
He's the most unhappy person,
if you go and see him.

00:06:36.901 --> 00:06:40.941
He's worried about small,
small things of life.

00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:43.241
You must have heard that people
who are very rich

00:06:43.441 --> 00:06:45.151
are kleptomaniacs.

00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:47.611
They're worried, they're
very miserly,

00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:51.401
they're worried about a needle
here and there.

00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:55.321
A little thing missing they
get upset.

00:06:55.781 --> 00:06:59.491
They have so many habits that
they can't live without it.

00:06:59.731 --> 00:07:06.151
So riches have brought always
a curse on human beings.

00:07:07.241 --> 00:07:11.491
So those who seek only
the riches

00:07:11.691 --> 00:07:15.151
cannot enjoy them.

00:07:15.821 --> 00:07:17.941
Then there are some
better people,

00:07:18.191 --> 00:07:20.531
who think that by
ruling others,

00:07:20.731 --> 00:07:26.651
by getting power,
they can achieve

00:07:27.651 --> 00:07:31.571
very great position in life,

00:07:31.741 --> 00:07:34.191
they too assume, fail.

00:07:34.401 --> 00:07:36.191
You have seen what
happens to them,

00:07:36.401 --> 00:07:41.151
people don't even want
to talk about them.

00:07:42.611 --> 00:07:46.941
Now there are people
who get attached to someone

00:07:47.191 --> 00:07:51.441
to one person or to the family, to
their children, to their relations,

00:07:51.691 --> 00:07:53.861
very common in India.

00:07:54.071 --> 00:07:58.901
That's also not the way you
can get to God,

00:08:00.731 --> 00:08:02.781
that's also so limited,

00:08:02.991 --> 00:08:05.821
keeps you hanging
round them

00:08:06.031 --> 00:08:11.731
and wasting your energy
completely.

00:08:15.571 --> 00:08:22.781
But if you enter into
your being fully,

00:08:22.991 --> 00:08:27.361
then all these things have
such meaning;

00:08:27.571 --> 00:08:30.281
everything has
a meaning then.

00:08:30.531 --> 00:08:34.031
In a sense if you posses
anything,

00:08:34.241 --> 00:08:38.651
and if you're that kind of a person
who is supposed to keep possessing,

00:08:40.571 --> 00:08:44.941
he never possesses,
he's so detached.

00:08:45.151 --> 00:08:49.691
He's never possessive;
he's so detached about it.

00:08:49.861 --> 00:08:53.281
But, he can play around, because
he's so detached,

00:08:53.531 --> 00:08:56.611
he can create a drama
out of it.

00:08:56.821 --> 00:09:01.941
He can play with
the possessions,

00:09:02.151 --> 00:09:05.111
and teach lots of lessons
to people,

00:09:05.321 --> 00:09:12.611
HeÂ´s so detached, so generous,
he enjoys his generosity.

00:09:15.491 --> 00:09:19.031
The whole thing becomes
so different so dynamic.

00:09:19.281 --> 00:09:22.731
All the beauty that is created
by human beings,

00:09:22.901 --> 00:09:27.241
as possession is exposed
before you

00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:32.571
and you start enjoying
all those things

00:09:32.741 --> 00:09:35.991
without possessing them.

00:09:36.191 --> 00:09:41.241
You understand the myth
of possession.

00:09:42.731 --> 00:09:48.731
Same with your powers that people
have over other people.

00:09:49.151 --> 00:09:54.111
Those who try to make
money out of Sahaja Yoga,

00:09:54.321 --> 00:09:59.071
or want to have a kind
of a privilege over Sahaja Yoga

00:09:59.321 --> 00:10:03.401
can be subtle, this can
go very far.

00:10:03.651 --> 00:10:05.741
This subtlety goes to
this extent

00:10:05.991 --> 00:10:12.321
that I've seen people try to save
money on account of Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:12.571 --> 00:10:18.151
That's also the attention
is on money.

00:10:19.491 --> 00:10:22.781
To make money or
to save money,

00:10:23.031 --> 00:10:27.111
to make a business out of
Sahaja Yoga is all absurd,

00:10:27.321 --> 00:10:30.281
but if you say so I say,
"All right go ahead for a while,

00:10:30.531 --> 00:10:35.941
try. You'll find that Sahaja Yoga
is no business."

00:10:36.151 --> 00:10:41.151
Of course Sahaja Yogis
can work together,

00:10:41.401 --> 00:10:45.321
can do some business,
but Sahaja Yoga is no business.

00:10:45.571 --> 00:10:47.861
Is business of God,

00:10:48.071 --> 00:10:52.651
where you have to give
everything that you have,

00:10:52.821 --> 00:10:55.781
not ot be attached
to anything,

00:10:55.991 --> 00:10:57.941
not to be attached.

00:10:58.191 --> 00:11:00.401
There's no money
to be paid as such,

00:11:00.651 --> 00:11:04.191
but all your heart has
to be poured into it.

00:11:04.441 --> 00:11:07.321
If you cannot pour your
heart into it

00:11:07.571 --> 00:11:11.731
you cannot achieve.

00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:14.731
Same about power.

00:11:14.901 --> 00:11:16.731
Some people think

00:11:16.941 --> 00:11:19.281
that they can even overpower
Sahaja Yogis,

00:11:19.531 --> 00:11:23.861
impress them, control them,

00:11:24.111 --> 00:11:29.571
such people are thrown out of
Sahaja Yoga completely.

00:11:30.111 --> 00:11:35.241
You have to enjoy
the power of love,

00:11:35.491 --> 00:11:39.111
that people see you as
their protector,

00:11:39.361 --> 00:11:42.731
as their help, as their
support,

00:11:42.991 --> 00:11:48.401
as their friend,

00:11:48.901 --> 00:11:53.241
than somebody who is
a dominating personality.

00:11:56.491 --> 00:12:03.731
You have to be a father head and
not a demonic destructive force,

00:12:03.901 --> 00:12:06.111
which is always threatening
everyone.

00:12:06.361 --> 00:12:09.941
Such people will be thrown out
of Sahaja Yoga in no time.

00:12:10.191 --> 00:12:11.651
You are found out.

00:12:12.821 --> 00:12:15.821
I have  no sympathies
with such people, never,

00:12:16.031 --> 00:12:21.191
that will bring you down,
in no way.

00:12:22.731 --> 00:12:24.691
Keep your self aloof
with them,

00:12:24.901 --> 00:12:30.531
otherwise when they are thrown
away as tangents from Sahaja Yoga

00:12:30.731 --> 00:12:32.861
you might get out
with them,

00:12:33.151 --> 00:12:36.731
so be careful.

00:12:37.941 --> 00:12:40.691
Then those people who waste
all their time

00:12:41.991 --> 00:12:44.111
just thinking about
their family, this thing,

00:12:44.321 --> 00:12:46.781
or those who have never
thought of their family,

00:12:46.991 --> 00:12:48.861
also come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:49.071 --> 00:12:52.031
This is a very subtler
ground

00:12:52.241 --> 00:12:58.731
on which they can loose
their attention to their Spirit.

00:12:59.361 --> 00:13:04.731
They spoil their children, they spoil
their husbands, they spoil their wives.

00:13:04.941 --> 00:13:10.491
The whole attention
goes in a wrong way

00:13:10.691 --> 00:13:13.321
and it becomes a very
important issue with them,

00:13:13.571 --> 00:13:17.491
how the marriages are successful, how
the children are this thing, that thing.

00:13:17.691 --> 00:13:19.281
They don't leave it to God.

00:13:19.491 --> 00:13:22.151
They have to leave it to God.
We are all Saints,

00:13:22.361 --> 00:13:26.361
you have to leave every
thing to God.

00:13:27.111 --> 00:13:29.491
In the beginning in Sahaja Yoga
everybody says,

00:13:29.691 --> 00:13:33.441
"My husband is like that, my wife is
like that, my brother is like that,

00:13:33.651 --> 00:13:35.781
my children are like this.
Mother look after them,"

00:13:35.991 --> 00:13:38.071
all right in the beginning,
is all right.

00:13:38.281 --> 00:13:41.731
When you grow you
must get out of it.

00:13:41.941 --> 00:13:46.991
It's an individual journey towards
God when you meditate,

00:13:47.191 --> 00:13:50.941
and when you reach there
then you become collective.

00:13:51.191 --> 00:13:57.071
Before that, it's an absolute
individual journey within,

00:13:57.281 --> 00:13:59.941
absolutely individual journey.

00:14:00.151 --> 00:14:04.611
You should be able to
see this.

00:14:05.401 --> 00:14:10.901
You are in this journey
nobody is your relation

00:14:11.111 --> 00:14:14.901
nobody is your brother, nobody
is your friend,

00:14:15.151 --> 00:14:19.241
you're absolutely alone,

00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:22.651
absolutely alone.

00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:26.241
You have to move alone
within yourself.

00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:30.321
Don't hate anyone,
don't be responsible,

00:14:30.531 --> 00:14:34.361
but in meditative mood
you're alone.

00:14:34.611 --> 00:14:38.151
No one exists there,
you alone,

00:14:38.361 --> 00:14:41.901
and once you enter
into that ocean

00:14:42.111 --> 00:14:45.111
then the whole world
becomes your family.

00:14:45.361 --> 00:14:51.861
The whole world is your
own manifestation.

00:14:52.111 --> 00:14:56.361
All the children become
your children

00:14:56.611 --> 00:15:04.401
and you treat all people with
equal understanding.

00:15:09.441 --> 00:15:15.321
The whole expansion takes place when
you enter inside your Spirit

00:15:15.571 --> 00:15:21.531
and see starting through
the eyes of the Spirit.

00:15:22.731 --> 00:15:29.441
Such calm, such peace,
such bliss exists within you.

00:15:31.361 --> 00:15:36.151
You have to be ready
for that journey.

00:15:39.111 --> 00:15:48.191
That journey is alone in
your meditativeness

00:15:48.401 --> 00:15:50.441
and the more you find something
in your meditation

00:15:50.651 --> 00:15:54.361
the more you want to go
and distribute it to others.

00:15:54.611 --> 00:15:56.571
That has to,

00:15:56.821 --> 00:16:00.191
if that does not come into you
then it has not worked out.

00:16:00.401 --> 00:16:05.821
There is no purity, there's
some sort of a bias.

00:16:06.111 --> 00:16:08.991
In that individual pursuit,
what ever you find,

00:16:09.191 --> 00:16:12.191
you want to enjoy
it with others,

00:16:12.441 --> 00:16:13.861
want to give it to others.

00:16:14.071 --> 00:16:18.401
This is the sign of a person who
has been really meditating.

00:16:18.651 --> 00:16:20.691
The one who is meditative

00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:25.611
and has not been able to
distribute  what he has found,

00:16:25.781 --> 00:16:33.241
is cheating himself and
cheating others as well.

00:16:33.781 --> 00:16:38.611
Because that joy that you
receive in your meditation

00:16:38.781 --> 00:16:46.281
has to be distributed, has
to be given, has to be shown.

00:16:46.531 --> 00:16:49.781
It should flow in your
being

00:16:50.191 --> 00:16:56.441
as a light radiates from
every illumined lamp.

00:16:56.691 --> 00:16:58.731
We don't have to take
a vow

00:16:58.901 --> 00:17:01.281
to say this is an enlightened
light,

00:17:01.491 --> 00:17:02.651
in the same way,

00:17:02.821 --> 00:17:07.111
a saint should not be certified
that he is a saint.

00:17:07.321 --> 00:17:12.941
The depth you achieve within
yourself spreads all over,

00:17:13.191 --> 00:17:16.361
it is such an action
and reaction.

00:17:16.571 --> 00:17:20.821
The more deeper you become
the radiation is much more.

00:17:21.111 --> 00:17:24.861
A simple person, very
ordinary person,

00:17:25.071 --> 00:17:29.821
uneducated person,
can be like that.

00:17:30.031 --> 00:17:34.491
We have you know, one
gentleman called Vardic in Bombay

00:17:34.731 --> 00:17:40.571
he's an old man,
he's so deep, he radiates.

00:17:40.741 --> 00:17:45.611
People depend on him,
he radiates love,

00:17:45.781 --> 00:17:47.151
so meditative.

00:17:47.361 --> 00:17:51.691
You don't have to spend too
much time on meditation,

00:17:51.901 --> 00:17:56.941
but what ever you spend time,
what ever you gain

00:17:57.151 --> 00:18:00.491
is has to be visible
outside,

00:18:00.691 --> 00:18:08.111
how you radiate and how
you give it to others.

00:18:09.491 --> 00:18:12.941
That's the quality of the
saints you have to be.

00:18:13.151 --> 00:18:17.401
Unless and until you become deeper,
we cannot save other Sahaja Yogis

00:18:17.611 --> 00:18:21.191
and we cannot save those
who are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:18:21.401 --> 00:18:30.571
You have to rise higher and higher
to pull the whole curtain up.

00:18:32.151 --> 00:18:36.071
Those who try to rise
higher

00:18:36.281 --> 00:18:39.111
pull the whole thing
upward

00:18:39.321 --> 00:18:44.571
and they give a pull to everyone
who ascend with them.

00:18:44.731 --> 00:18:49.731
So just try to keep your
aim clear cut.

00:18:49.901 --> 00:18:52.691
Must understand what is
your aim in life as Sahaja Yogis.

00:18:52.861 --> 00:18:54.491
Now you are changed
people.

00:18:54.691 --> 00:18:58.111
You are no more people who have
to deal with possessions

00:18:58.321 --> 00:19:04.241
worry about them, about mundane
things, about your livelihoods.

00:19:04.491 --> 00:19:06.491
You are no more people
who have to worry too much

00:19:06.651 --> 00:19:10.941
about your health and things
or your personal lives.

00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:15.991
You are not to worry also
about your jobs so much,

00:19:16.191 --> 00:19:19.441
that's not important

00:19:21.441 --> 00:19:24.781
and last of all not to
worry about your family,

00:19:24.991 --> 00:19:27.731
children, husband, wife

00:19:27.941 --> 00:19:33.731
and find a pocket
for you to hide into it.

00:19:33.941 --> 00:19:37.031
Because the only thing where
you can really hide yourself

00:19:37.241 --> 00:19:42.441
is the love of God, where
you can really get

00:19:42.691 --> 00:19:46.941
the great restful, blissful,
feeling

00:19:47.151 --> 00:19:52.401
of his complete protection.

00:19:55.991 --> 00:19:59.941
Sydney has done very well before
and it's progressing better,

00:20:00.151 --> 00:20:02.991
but the pace is not
as it should be.

00:20:03.191 --> 00:20:05.491
So we have to think of new
ways and methods

00:20:05.691 --> 00:20:08.151
how we can spread this.

00:20:08.361 --> 00:20:12.281
But first you must assume
your positions as you are.

00:20:12.491 --> 00:20:15.491
You must assume that
you are all saints

00:20:15.691 --> 00:20:17.941
that you have to
do great work -

00:20:18.151 --> 00:20:22.861
not the ego part of it,
but the manifestation of it.

00:20:23.071 --> 00:20:27.781
Every one of you has
to decide for oneself.

00:20:28.031 --> 00:20:30.731
I'm sure it's going
to work out,

00:20:30.941 --> 00:20:36.241
and this time My visit is going
to help you a lot by understanding

00:20:36.441 --> 00:20:43.991
what is the best to spread
this light all.

00:20:44.281 --> 00:20:48.071
May God bless you.
