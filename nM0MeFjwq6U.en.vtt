WEBVTT

01:25.571 --> 01:31.691
Now we all have realized
by this time,

01:31.861 --> 01:42.191
within us lies the peace, the beauty,
the glory of our being.

01:42.401 --> 01:46.281
There's an ocean of all
that.

01:47.821 --> 01:50.861
We cannot seek it outside,

01:51.111 --> 01:54.821
we have to go within,

01:55.031 --> 01:58.941
what they call in
the meditative state,

01:59.151 --> 02:04.151
you seek it, you enjoy it.

02:04.491 --> 02:08.941
Like when you are thirsty,

02:09.151 --> 02:16.571
you go to a river or you
go to a ocean,

02:18.991 --> 02:23.401
and try to quench
your thirst.

02:23.691 --> 02:28.731
But even the ocean cannot
give you sweet water.

02:36.611 --> 02:39.691
So how can anything
that is spread outside

02:39.901 --> 02:44.941
give you that deep thing
that is within you?

02:45.191 --> 02:51.731
You are trying to find it outside,
where it does not lie.

02:52.191 --> 02:57.281
It is within us, absolutely
with in us.

03:00.571 --> 03:04.991
It is so simple because
it is your own

03:05.191 --> 03:08.111
it is within your reach,

03:08.441 --> 03:11.401
just there.

03:11.821 --> 03:16.941
What ever you have
been doing

03:17.991 --> 03:22.731
going out to find
the joy,

03:22.941 --> 03:27.241
the so called joy,
the so called happiness,

03:27.491 --> 03:38.281
the so called glory of worldly
powers and wordly possessions,

03:40.531 --> 03:44.991
you have to reverse it back
the whole thing.

03:46.071 --> 03:51.191
You have to project
within yourself.

03:51.731 --> 03:55.281
It was not wrong
that you went out,

03:55.531 --> 03:59.821
it was not correct
that you went out,

04:00.531 --> 04:05.941
shouldn't feel sorry for what
you have done so far.

04:06.571 --> 04:10.731
It was not the correct
way

04:10.941 --> 04:16.901
to get to the real joy
of life,

04:17.111 --> 04:22.151
the real glory of your
being.

04:25.941 --> 04:28.151
It has worked in so
many people

04:28.361 --> 04:34.111
that you have entered into
that subtler understanding.

04:34.361 --> 04:38.491
Some people are only at a mental
level, maybe, doesn't matter.

04:38.731 --> 04:44.531
Maybe, some are only at a physical
level that they can feel it,

04:44.731 --> 04:48.821
doesn't matter. But, you are
on the correct lines

04:49.031 --> 04:51.991
you are moving correctly.

04:52.281 --> 04:54.861
Try to meditate,

04:55.111 --> 04:59.991
meditate more so that you
reach your inner being.

05:00.191 --> 05:04.191
And this inner being, is the
vast ocean of bliss,

05:04.441 --> 05:08.321
which exists in
every one of us.

05:08.861 --> 05:13.941
Is that vast glorifying
flood of light

05:14.241 --> 05:20.491
that floods everybody's
inner beauty.

05:21.941 --> 05:24.611
So to approach it,

05:24.821 --> 05:32.651
you have to go within yourself
by denying things,

05:32.821 --> 05:37.191
which are against it,
against your movement.

05:37.441 --> 05:42.861
Sometimes the wind can be
very, very strong for you

05:43.151 --> 05:47.111
to misunderstand

05:47.741 --> 05:58.651
that the glory of God
is within.

05:59.361 --> 06:01.781
The turn back,

06:02.241 --> 06:11.071
every moment remember that
your movement has to be inward.

06:13.611 --> 06:17.191
When you move inward

06:17.441 --> 06:22.821
you forget the ideas of your
outer glories.

06:23.111 --> 06:27.821
A person, who is of a very
base nature,

06:28.031 --> 06:30.111
thinks that if he makes
a lot of money

06:30.361 --> 06:33.901
then he has achieved
joy, but he has not.

06:34.191 --> 06:36.731
He's the most unhappy person,
if you go and see him.

06:36.901 --> 06:40.941
He's worried about small,
small things of life.

06:41.151 --> 06:43.241
You must have heard that people
who are very rich

06:43.441 --> 06:45.151
are kleptomaniacs.

06:45.441 --> 06:47.611
They're worried, they're
very miserly,

06:47.781 --> 06:51.401
they're worried about a needle
here and there.

06:51.611 --> 06:55.321
A little thing missing they
get upset.

06:55.781 --> 06:59.491
They have so many habits that
they can't live without it.

06:59.731 --> 07:06.151
So riches have brought always
a curse on human beings.

07:07.241 --> 07:11.491
So those who seek only
the riches

07:11.691 --> 07:15.151
cannot enjoy them.

07:15.821 --> 07:17.941
Then there are some
better people,

07:18.191 --> 07:20.531
who think that by
ruling others,

07:20.731 --> 07:26.651
by getting power,
they can achieve

07:27.651 --> 07:31.571
very great position in life,

07:31.741 --> 07:34.191
they too assume, fail.

07:34.401 --> 07:36.191
You have seen what
happens to them,

07:36.401 --> 07:41.151
people don't even want
to talk about them.

07:42.611 --> 07:46.941
Now there are people
who get attached to someone

07:47.191 --> 07:51.441
to one person or to the family, to
their children, to their relations,

07:51.691 --> 07:53.861
very common in India.

07:54.071 --> 07:58.901
That's also not the way you
can get to God,

08:00.731 --> 08:02.781
that's also so limited,

08:02.991 --> 08:05.821
keeps you hanging
round them

08:06.031 --> 08:11.731
and wasting your energy
completely.

08:15.571 --> 08:22.781
But if you enter into
your being fully,

08:22.991 --> 08:27.361
then all these things have
such meaning;

08:27.571 --> 08:30.281
everything has
a meaning then.

08:30.531 --> 08:34.031
In a sense if you posses
anything,

08:34.241 --> 08:38.651
and if you're that kind of a person
who is supposed to keep possessing,

08:40.571 --> 08:44.941
he never possesses,
he's so detached.

08:45.151 --> 08:49.691
He's never possessive;
he's so detached about it.

08:49.861 --> 08:53.281
But, he can play around, because
he's so detached,

08:53.531 --> 08:56.611
he can create a drama
out of it.

08:56.821 --> 09:01.941
He can play with
the possessions,

09:02.151 --> 09:05.111
and teach lots of lessons
to people,

09:05.321 --> 09:12.611
HeÂ´s so detached, so generous,
he enjoys his generosity.

09:15.491 --> 09:19.031
The whole thing becomes
so different so dynamic.

09:19.281 --> 09:22.731
All the beauty that is created
by human beings,

09:22.901 --> 09:27.241
as possession is exposed
before you

09:28.901 --> 09:32.571
and you start enjoying
all those things

09:32.741 --> 09:35.991
without possessing them.

09:36.191 --> 09:41.241
You understand the myth
of possession.

09:42.731 --> 09:48.731
Same with your powers that people
have over other people.

09:49.151 --> 09:54.111
Those who try to make
money out of Sahaja Yoga,

09:54.321 --> 09:59.071
or want to have a kind
of a privilege over Sahaja Yoga

09:59.321 --> 10:03.401
can be subtle, this can
go very far.

10:03.651 --> 10:05.741
This subtlety goes to
this extent

10:05.991 --> 10:12.321
that I've seen people try to save
money on account of Sahaja Yoga.

10:12.571 --> 10:18.151
That's also the attention
is on money.

10:19.491 --> 10:22.781
To make money or
to save money,

10:23.031 --> 10:27.111
to make a business out of
Sahaja Yoga is all absurd,

10:27.321 --> 10:30.281
but if you say so I say,
"All right go ahead for a while,

10:30.531 --> 10:35.941
try. You'll find that Sahaja Yoga
is no business."

10:36.151 --> 10:41.151
Of course Sahaja Yogis
can work together,

10:41.401 --> 10:45.321
can do some business,
but Sahaja Yoga is no business.

10:45.571 --> 10:47.861
Is business of God,

10:48.071 --> 10:52.651
where you have to give
everything that you have,

10:52.821 --> 10:55.781
not ot be attached
to anything,

10:55.991 --> 10:57.941
not to be attached.

10:58.191 --> 11:00.401
There's no money
to be paid as such,

11:00.651 --> 11:04.191
but all your heart has
to be poured into it.

11:04.441 --> 11:07.321
If you cannot pour your
heart into it

11:07.571 --> 11:11.731
you cannot achieve.

11:12.901 --> 11:14.731
Same about power.

11:14.901 --> 11:16.731
Some people think

11:16.941 --> 11:19.281
that they can even overpower
Sahaja Yogis,

11:19.531 --> 11:23.861
impress them, control them,

11:24.111 --> 11:29.571
such people are thrown out of
Sahaja Yoga completely.

11:30.111 --> 11:35.241
You have to enjoy
the power of love,

11:35.491 --> 11:39.111
that people see you as
their protector,

11:39.361 --> 11:42.731
as their help, as their
support,

11:42.991 --> 11:48.401
as their friend,

11:48.901 --> 11:53.241
than somebody who is
a dominating personality.

11:56.491 --> 12:03.731
You have to be a father head and
not a demonic destructive force,

12:03.901 --> 12:06.111
which is always threatening
everyone.

12:06.361 --> 12:09.941
Such people will be thrown out
of Sahaja Yoga in no time.

12:10.191 --> 12:11.651
You are found out.

12:12.821 --> 12:15.821
I have  no sympathies
with such people, never,

12:16.031 --> 12:21.191
that will bring you down,
in no way.

12:22.731 --> 12:24.691
Keep your self aloof
with them,

12:24.901 --> 12:30.531
otherwise when they are thrown
away as tangents from Sahaja Yoga

12:30.731 --> 12:32.861
you might get out
with them,

12:33.151 --> 12:36.731
so be careful.

12:37.941 --> 12:40.691
Then those people who waste
all their time

12:41.991 --> 12:44.111
just thinking about
their family, this thing,

12:44.321 --> 12:46.781
or those who have never
thought of their family,

12:46.991 --> 12:48.861
also come to Sahaja Yoga.

12:49.071 --> 12:52.031
This is a very subtler
ground

12:52.241 --> 12:58.731
on which they can loose
their attention to their Spirit.

12:59.361 --> 13:04.731
They spoil their children, they spoil
their husbands, they spoil their wives.

13:04.941 --> 13:10.491
The whole attention
goes in a wrong way

13:10.691 --> 13:13.321
and it becomes a very
important issue with them,

13:13.571 --> 13:17.491
how the marriages are successful, how
the children are this thing, that thing.

13:17.691 --> 13:19.281
They don't leave it to God.

13:19.491 --> 13:22.151
They have to leave it to God.
We are all Saints,

13:22.361 --> 13:26.361
you have to leave every
thing to God.

13:27.111 --> 13:29.491
In the beginning in Sahaja Yoga
everybody says,

13:29.691 --> 13:33.441
"My husband is like that, my wife is
like that, my brother is like that,

13:33.651 --> 13:35.781
my children are like this.
Mother look after them,"

13:35.991 --> 13:38.071
all right in the beginning,
is all right.

13:38.281 --> 13:41.731
When you grow you
must get out of it.

13:41.941 --> 13:46.991
It's an individual journey towards
God when you meditate,

13:47.191 --> 13:50.941
and when you reach there
then you become collective.

13:51.191 --> 13:57.071
Before that, it's an absolute
individual journey within,

13:57.281 --> 13:59.941
absolutely individual journey.

14:00.151 --> 14:04.611
You should be able to
see this.

14:05.401 --> 14:10.901
You are in this journey
nobody is your relation

14:11.111 --> 14:14.901
nobody is your brother, nobody
is your friend,

14:15.151 --> 14:19.241
you're absolutely alone,

14:19.901 --> 14:22.651
absolutely alone.

14:22.821 --> 14:26.241
You have to move alone
within yourself.

14:26.491 --> 14:30.321
Don't hate anyone,
don't be responsible,

14:30.531 --> 14:34.361
but in meditative mood
you're alone.

14:34.611 --> 14:38.151
No one exists there,
you alone,

14:38.361 --> 14:41.901
and once you enter
into that ocean

14:42.111 --> 14:45.111
then the whole world
becomes your family.

14:45.361 --> 14:51.861
The whole world is your
own manifestation.

14:52.111 --> 14:56.361
All the children become
your children

14:56.611 --> 15:04.401
and you treat all people with
equal understanding.

15:09.441 --> 15:15.321
The whole expansion takes place when
you enter inside your Spirit

15:15.571 --> 15:21.531
and see starting through
the eyes of the Spirit.

15:22.731 --> 15:29.441
Such calm, such peace,
such bliss exists within you.

15:31.361 --> 15:36.151
You have to be ready
for that journey.

15:39.111 --> 15:48.191
That journey is alone in
your meditativeness

15:48.401 --> 15:50.441
and the more you find something
in your meditation

15:50.651 --> 15:54.361
the more you want to go
and distribute it to others.

15:54.611 --> 15:56.571
That has to,

15:56.821 --> 16:00.191
if that does not come into you
then it has not worked out.

16:00.401 --> 16:05.821
There is no purity, there's
some sort of a bias.

16:06.111 --> 16:08.991
In that individual pursuit,
what ever you find,

16:09.191 --> 16:12.191
you want to enjoy
it with others,

16:12.441 --> 16:13.861
want to give it to others.

16:14.071 --> 16:18.401
This is the sign of a person who
has been really meditating.

16:18.651 --> 16:20.691
The one who is meditative

16:21.731 --> 16:25.611
and has not been able to
distribute  what he has found,

16:25.781 --> 16:33.241
is cheating himself and
cheating others as well.

16:33.781 --> 16:38.611
Because that joy that you
receive in your meditation

16:38.781 --> 16:46.281
has to be distributed, has
to be given, has to be shown.

16:46.531 --> 16:49.781
It should flow in your
being

16:50.191 --> 16:56.441
as a light radiates from
every illumined lamp.

16:56.691 --> 16:58.731
We don't have to take
a vow

16:58.901 --> 17:01.281
to say this is an enlightened
light,

17:01.491 --> 17:02.651
in the same way,

17:02.821 --> 17:07.111
a saint should not be certified
that he is a saint.

17:07.321 --> 17:12.941
The depth you achieve within
yourself spreads all over,

17:13.191 --> 17:16.361
it is such an action
and reaction.

17:16.571 --> 17:20.821
The more deeper you become
the radiation is much more.

17:21.111 --> 17:24.861
A simple person, very
ordinary person,

17:25.071 --> 17:29.821
uneducated person,
can be like that.

17:30.031 --> 17:34.491
We have you know, one
gentleman called Vardic in Bombay

17:34.731 --> 17:40.571
he's an old man,
he's so deep, he radiates.

17:40.741 --> 17:45.611
People depend on him,
he radiates love,

17:45.781 --> 17:47.151
so meditative.

17:47.361 --> 17:51.691
You don't have to spend too
much time on meditation,

17:51.901 --> 17:56.941
but what ever you spend time,
what ever you gain

17:57.151 --> 18:00.491
is has to be visible
outside,

18:00.691 --> 18:08.111
how you radiate and how
you give it to others.

18:09.491 --> 18:12.941
That's the quality of the
saints you have to be.

18:13.151 --> 18:17.401
Unless and until you become deeper,
we cannot save other Sahaja Yogis

18:17.611 --> 18:21.191
and we cannot save those
who are not Sahaja Yogis.

18:21.401 --> 18:30.571
You have to rise higher and higher
to pull the whole curtain up.

18:32.151 --> 18:36.071
Those who try to rise
higher

18:36.281 --> 18:39.111
pull the whole thing
upward

18:39.321 --> 18:44.571
and they give a pull to everyone
who ascend with them.

18:44.731 --> 18:49.731
So just try to keep your
aim clear cut.

18:49.901 --> 18:52.691
Must understand what is
your aim in life as Sahaja Yogis.

18:52.861 --> 18:54.491
Now you are changed
people.

18:54.691 --> 18:58.111
You are no more people who have
to deal with possessions

18:58.321 --> 19:04.241
worry about them, about mundane
things, about your livelihoods.

19:04.491 --> 19:06.491
You are no more people
who have to worry too much

19:06.651 --> 19:10.941
about your health and things
or your personal lives.

19:11.151 --> 19:15.991
You are not to worry also
about your jobs so much,

19:16.191 --> 19:19.441
that's not important

19:21.441 --> 19:24.781
and last of all not to
worry about your family,

19:24.991 --> 19:27.731
children, husband, wife

19:27.941 --> 19:33.731
and find a pocket
for you to hide into it.

19:33.941 --> 19:37.031
Because the only thing where
you can really hide yourself

19:37.241 --> 19:42.441
is the love of God, where
you can really get

19:42.691 --> 19:46.941
the great restful, blissful,
feeling

19:47.151 --> 19:52.401
of his complete protection.

19:55.991 --> 19:59.941
Sydney has done very well before
and it's progressing better,

20:00.151 --> 20:02.991
but the pace is not
as it should be.

20:03.191 --> 20:05.491
So we have to think of new
ways and methods

20:05.691 --> 20:08.151
how we can spread this.

20:08.361 --> 20:12.281
But first you must assume
your positions as you are.

20:12.491 --> 20:15.491
You must assume that
you are all saints

20:15.691 --> 20:17.941
that you have to
do great work -

20:18.151 --> 20:22.861
not the ego part of it,
but the manifestation of it.

20:23.071 --> 20:27.781
Every one of you has
to decide for oneself.

20:28.031 --> 20:30.731
I'm sure it's going
to work out,

20:30.941 --> 20:36.241
and this time My visit is going
to help you a lot by understanding

20:36.441 --> 20:43.991
what is the best to spread
this light all.

20:44.281 --> 20:48.071
May God bless you.
