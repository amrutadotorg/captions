00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:21.000
Today we are celebrating Sahastrara day. Perhaps
we have not realised what a day it must have

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:37.040
been. Without opening the Sahastrara, God
Itself was a myth, religion itself was a myth,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:49.050
and all talk about Divinity was a myth. People
believed in it but it was just a belief. And

00:00:49.050 --> 00:01:10.259
the science, as it was put forward, was about
to obliterate all the value system, all the

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:21.240
proof of God Almighty.
If you see in the history, one after another,

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:31.079
when science established itself, the people
who are so-called in charge of the helm of

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:40.340
affairs in religion, in different religions
tried to cope with the findings of science.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:49.289
They tried to show that: “All right, if
it is said this much – is in the Bible,

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:59.990
and if it is wrong we should correct it.”
Especially Augustine did that. And it started

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:11.340
looking as if it’s all a stupidity this,
these scriptures were just mythical. At least

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:27.040
the Koran itself, though, had lots of things
which were describing the biology of today.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:36.670
They could not believe that human beings were
specially created by God. They thought it

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:45.030
was a matter of chance that one after another
the animals acquired a situation by which

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:58.790
they became human beings. Thus all the time
Divinity was challenged and there was no way

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:10.680
of giving a proof of whatever is said in the
Bible or in the Koran or in the Gita or in

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:24.400
the Upanishadas or in the Torah. Any one of
these things could not be proved because it

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.370
was still just a faith.
Very, very few people got their Realisation

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.580
and when they talked, people did not believe
them and thought that they are just trying

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:42.870
to say something which they are using to propound
their own theories.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:56.470
So the whole thing became a kind of dead science.
There was no science of religion. People started

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.540
thinking that: what’s the use of following
these ten commandments or these strict rules

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:11.900
of life, because by following that you gain
nothing. You lose all the fun of the life.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:21.489
And why think of gaining some punyas also.
And that is how all the time there was a big

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:31.830
derailment of human value system.
Also these organised religions, this monolithic

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:41.039
organised religions started taking to [a]
course of gaining power, or gaining money,

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:46.090
because they thought that’s the only way
you can control people and can go on. They

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:53.520
were least bothered as to deliver the goods,
whatever have been described in the Bible.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:00.961
Bible of course was tampered [with] very much
and has been lot of changes in that. And a

00:05:00.961 --> 00:05:12.389
person like Paul, and Peter, who joined together,
tried to spoil most of the Truth. Though Koran

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:20.160
was not so much touched but still is dealt
with more the right side, with the reproductive

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.860
system and all those things. And so many things
are still ambiguous.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.730
Now simultaneously two things have happened,
I don’t know if you are aware of it or not.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:42.229
First thing that has happened is that now
we have a new science of microbiology in which

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:54.229
we have discovered that every cell has got
a DNA tape. Every cell has got a program in

00:05:54.229 --> 00:06:05.819
it. As we have in a computer a chip, every
cell has got a tape in it, in a way, that

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:11.909
it is programmed. And according to that program
a development takes place. Now imagine the

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:14.499
intricacy of the whole thing!

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:28.069
So many computers are already programmed and
all these cells have these in them. So a very

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:33.650
mysterious sort of a thing has come up before
the scientists and they cannot explain it.

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:39.389
They cannot explain many things but one of
them is this.

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:47.490
Now what Sahaja Yoga has done is that it has
proved that it is the Will of God, it is the

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:59.029
desire of God, the Will of God, which is doing
all the work. And it has been proved.

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:07.020
All these Chaitanya, Adi Shakti, is nothing
but the Will of God. And Will of God is the

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:14.099
One is working out everything very harmoniously.
I don’t know if some of you must have read

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:22.050
my book, first book, where I have described
how this Earth was created. There was a bang,

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:33.639
but it was very harmonious, and how it developed
is through the Will of God. So everything

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:41.099
was done in a way that God’s will was working
it out.

00:07:41.099 --> 00:07:48.169
Now the Will of God you are feeling it, on
your finger tips. After Realisation, now,

00:07:48.169 --> 00:07:56.680
you have discovered the the absolute science,
which is the Will of God, which is an absolute

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:02.189
science. You people know that we have cured
people through Sahaja Yoga. You also know

00:08:02.189 --> 00:08:08.159
giving bandhan, and all that, things work
out. So many things work out automatically

00:08:08.159 --> 00:08:11.949
after Realisation that people don’t want
to believe.

00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:16.649
In the beginning people would not believe
when the scientists told them something, but

00:08:16.649 --> 00:08:22.899
now it is, you can see, the science is always
in the flux, all the time changing. One theory

00:08:22.899 --> 00:08:29.809
is again challenged. Another theory’s again
challenged. But Sahaja Yoga has exposed you

00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:38.650
to that Great Truth of science which cannot
be challenged, which is all there.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:49.650
So anybody who comes out with any new proposal
about defaming God, or saying that there is

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:55.330
no God, we can prove, not [only] that there
is God, but that everything, the creation

00:08:55.330 --> 00:09:02.400
of this Earth, the creation of human beings
and everything was done harmoniously by the

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:09.390
Will of God.
If Will of God has done everything, the human

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:14.961
beings should not take any credit for discovering
some things which were created by God. Supposing

00:09:14.961 --> 00:09:20.320
this carpet is made by somebody and we start
discovering all the colours, what is so great?

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:27.200
It is all there. You cannot create.
So it is not the creation part of it [which

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:34.320
is] so much important but the fashioning of
this world, whole thing was done by the Will

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:45.070
of God. Now if the Will of God is so important,
it has to be proved. And now through Sahaja

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:52.760
Yoga, after the breaking of the Sahastrara,
you have now, for the first time, felt the

00:09:52.760 --> 00:10:00.240
Will of God, which is such an important thing,
but for us it is come to us so Sahaj that

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:08.850
we don’t understand. We just give the bandhan
and the things work out and we feel that the

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:20.100
things have worked out, so it is bandhan which
has worked out, and we have managed everything.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:27.940
It’s not so. It’s much more than that.
We have now become part and parcel of that

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:39.240
Big Computer of that Will of God. We have
become the medium, or we can say the channels,

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:49.320
of that Will of God. We are connected with
that Will of God which created all this Universe.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:11:00.000
So everything we can manage because we have
got the Absolute Science in our hand. TheAbsolute

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:08.340
Science which will work out the betterment
of the whole world. We can prove it to the

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:16.630
scientist that there is a Will of God which
has done all this creation. Even evolutionary

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:25.260
process is the Will of God. Without His Will
nothing could have happened.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:32.310
So many people used to say that – not even
a blade of grass moves without the Will of

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:39.930
God. Which is a very true thing. And you have
seen now that – the Will of God we have

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:50.940
got as our own power. We can use it. So how
important it is to be a sahaja yogi. Perhaps

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:55.260
we don’t realise how important it is to
be a sahaja yogi.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:12:03.450
Sahaja Yoga is not only for saying “Mother,
I am full of joy, I am enjoying myself. I

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:10.530
got purified. Everything is fine“. But for
what? Why did you get all these blessings?

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:16.370
Why you have been cleansed? So that this knowledge
of the Will of God should be apparent in you.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:20.260
Not only that – should be a part and parcel
of you.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:26.630
So we have to raise our level, we have to
come up. For mediocre and ordinary people

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:32.120
it is really useless to give them Sahaja Yoga
because they are good for nothing. They are

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:39.600
not going to help us in any way because what
is needed is now, today that, we should have

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:46.240
people who can really manifest and reflect
the Will of God. And for that, you can understand,

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:52.440
we have to have very strong people because
this Will has created the whole Universe,

00:12:52.440 --> 00:13:01.940
the Cosmos, this Mother Earth. Everything
is created by this Will of God.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:12.530
So now we are exposed to a new dimension and
that dimension is that we are the ones who

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:24.320
are channels of that Will of God. So then
what is our duty and what should we do about

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:30.910
it?
As a result of Sahastrara being opened out,

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:39.550
one thing: the illusions have vanished. What
you call [in] Sanskrit is bhranti. Illusions

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:54.930
have vanished. You should have no illusion
as to the existence of God Almighty, the power

00:13:54.930 --> 00:14:07.510
of his Will and the truth about Sahaja Yoga.
You should have no doubts at all, minimum

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:15.060
of minimum should be like that. But while
using this Power you should be aware that

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:26.620
this Power is given to you because you are
capable of handling it.

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:33.990
This is the Highest Power you could think
of. Take any governor, take any minister,

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:43.500
anyone, they can be removed tomorrow. They
can become corrupt. They can become absolutely

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:50.810
devoid of any knowledge of their own powers.
There are many people who just get elected

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:55.800
without knowing what they have to do.
So this is not just a conversion of people,

00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:04.280
it’s not only even transformation, but it
is a new fashioning of a new human being which

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:14.320
has come forward and which is capable of carrying
the Will of God further.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:34.860
So as a result of your Realisation, what you
have got? The first thing that has happened

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:43.350
is that your illusions have gone. You should
have no illusions about God Almighty, His

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:58.029
Will and that He is omnipotent, omnipresent
and omniscient. All His omnipotence has done

00:15:58.029 --> 00:16:06.610
this work, and as a collective consciousness
you should also know that you are also omnipotent,

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:13.850
omnipresent and omniscient.
Omniscient is the thing, that He sees everything,

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:24.210
knows everything. Part of it, that Power,
is also within you. So to prove His omnipresence

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:33.000
you have to all the time be aware that you
are sahaja yogis. When I find, even now, sahaja

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.160
yogis struggling about their wives, their
children, their house, their jobs, I start

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:45.529
wondering what is their level now? Where are
they? When are they going to take up the role

00:16:45.529 --> 00:16:55.720
of what they have got?
So the Omnipotent God who is everywhere, who

00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:04.220
has done all this, the Will of God that has
worked it out, has to work through you people

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:13.300
and you have to be very strong, very sensible,
very wise, also very effective people.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:20.800
The more effective you become the more energy
you will get. But still I feel that the sahaja

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:28.550
yogis are more, not taking the responsibility
of understanding that they have to represent

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:40.920
this God Almighty who is omnipresent, omniscient,
who knows everything, who sees everything

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:51.970
and who is potent, means Almighty.
If you understand that this is what has happened

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:58.850
after opening the Sahastrara, that you have
now got the power which has these three qualities

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:09.270
in it. Say now this big thing has to be supported
by a strong pillars, but supposing if they

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:14.820
are not strong, it will fall down. In the
same way such a Great Power which has come

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:20.390
to you. For that we don’t need very successful
people, we don’t need people who have a

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:25.791
big name or those who have lots of money,
what we need [is] people of character, people

00:18:25.791 --> 00:18:33.020
of understanding, of wisdom and of strength,
that “Whatever may come I will stand by

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:53.420
it, I will take to it, I’ll cope with it,
I’ll change myself and improve myself“.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:19:01.650
So now illusion has been dispelled. I hope
you all have got rid of your illusions. Also

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:07.980
you should have no illusions about yourself.
If you have any illusions you should leave

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:15.180
Sahaja Yoga. But know that you are chosen
for this purpose by God’s Will, that’s

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:21.809
why you are here and you have to take it up,
the responsibility of understanding of this

00:19:21.809 --> 00:19:31.610
science which is absolute. And working it
out yourself, for yourself as well as for

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:37.060
others.
You have felt My love, but your love must

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:45.180
also be felt, because God is love. So your
love must be felt by others. Other must feel

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:53.930
that you are compassionate, loving, understanding.
That’s all the time this Will of God is

00:19:53.930 --> 00:20:00.220
flowing through you. And you have to work
it out in such a manner that people should

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:06.820
know that you are a saint, that this power
is flowing through you.

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:13.250
Then the second thing that has happened to
you is that, not the illusion about God and

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:20.630
about yourself, second thing that has happened
– that you have understood the integration,

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:25.920
that in the world there is complete integration
which is existing.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:36.960
Normally if you see the children, they have
their own natural, innate understanding. They

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:43.790
know. If you see, normally, a good child would
always like to share his things, would like

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:49.040
to love another child, if there’s another
little child is there, would like to protect

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:57.260
that child – naturally! It won’t think
whether it has black hair or red hair or blue

00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:04.840
hair. Naturally, innately a child feels that
way.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:15.940
Also if you take another child, supposing,
who is a little baby, they know that one should

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:22.510
be careful about the privacy of the body.
Children don’t want to be made nude before

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:31.320
others. No child likes it. Innately they know.
So all these innate qualities are within you.

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.570
Children don’t like to steal anything. They
don’t know what is stealing is. They have

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:42.400
no idea of stealing. I’ve also seen also
children that, if they go to a place which

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:50.490
is very beautiful, in somebody’s house,
they will always try to keep the beauty of

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:57.660
that place. But if it is already shabby they
don’t mind.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:02.610
So innately all these qualities are there.
I think the countries which are supposed to

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:10.500
be underdeveloped have so many of these qualities
within them, which are innately built within

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:18.400
us. Innocence is innately built. So the Will
of God built up, first and foremost thing,

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:25.720
was innocence, the auspiciousness. The first
thing He did was to create Shri Ganesha, or

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:32.400
I would say, She, because the Will of God
is Adi Shakti. And all this was created first

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:40.610
of all to make the whole world very beautiful.
All these innate qualities were also placed

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:49.090
within you. All those Deities were placed
within you. [They] were specially made, human

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:57.460
beings, that they should become saintly people,
that they should have their saintly, innate

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:01.340
sense.
But it happened in the countries which developed,

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:08.700
that our brain was bombarded by all kinds
of television, all kind of things, and we

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:22.060
became very, we can say, we became very vulnerable.
We started getting into the ideas of others.

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:28.200
Anybody who is dominating could dominate us.
It’s not only Hitler who dominated people.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:35.800
We also see today how much we are dominated,
if you really detach yourself from this world.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:43.660
For example fashions. Certain things that
come up, people cannot give up at any cost.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:48.680
They cannot take to something that is sensible
because it’s a fashion.

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:55.800
For example nowadays there’s a fashion,
say to have such a small skirt. You can’t

00:23:55.800 --> 00:24:02.860
get a long skirt anywhere. Everybody has to
wear that kind of a skirt otherwise you are

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:12.070
not ‘in’, you are not in the madhouse!
Now this kind of thing is bombarded on us

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:19.551
morning till evening so, first of all, we
become slaves of these entrepreneurs. Whatever

00:24:19.551 --> 00:24:23.800
they give us now, I was told that in Belgium
you cannot get anything fresh. You have to

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:28.900
take everything from the supermarket, which
is all tinned.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:35.880
Gradually what is happening to us – we are
getting absolutely artificial. The food is

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:42.360
artificial, the dress is artificial, our whole
attitude becomes artificial because we are

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:49.500
so much bombarded by advertisement, by all
kinds of outside influences that we just get

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:56.850
lost and we forget what is our innate sense
which is being dominated by all these modern

00:24:56.850 --> 00:25:03.280
things.
So adding up to the science also there is

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:12.910
a a big progress in another direction, that
we can call, the money became very important.

00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:19.830
Once money becomes important, then all your
entrepreneurs become important, because they

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:24.050
know how to make money and befool you all
the time. Today you have this thing, tomorrow

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:28.820
you have that thing. Today you change this
and have this thing.

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:35.000
But those people who are innately built, they
do not change! They have their dresses of

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.970
the same type, they do not change. On the
contrary they find it very difficult to get

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:47.620
out of their traditional achievements and
they don’t want to change themselves. So

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:53.929
for sahaja yogis it is important to see and
watch if they are getting this slavery from

00:25:53.929 --> 00:26:02.750
the entrepreneurs in modern times.
Then, the thoughts. So many books we read,

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:11.620
which gives you thoughts, which are some mad
rambling, I would say, of some madman, like

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:21.060
Freud. How could Freud influence the West?
Because you have lost your innate sense and

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:32.170
you accepted. You accepted that and that’s
how Freud became your, sort of a, Jesus Christ.

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:37.890
He became the most important thing. Sex became
the most important thing. I mean it’s so

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:57.910
simple. With little common sense you can understand
that, at every moment, we are put into this

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:09.290
kind of a domination by these few domineering
people who have certain ideas, and they put

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:13.200
[these ideas] forward.
Anybody puts any idea. For example, Sade (the

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:18.300
Marquis de Sade) or Sartre or anyone. That
idea starts becoming “Oh he said it“.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:24.340
Who is he? What is his life? Just see for
yourself what sort of a man he is. With little

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:29.890
common sense. But with your will that you
have now, Will of God, which has fashioned

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:33.140
the whole world, which has fashioned you.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:39.150
Every cell within you has been fashioned by
God Almighty and what you are doing is to

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:47.250
play into the hands of these entrepreneurs.
They have realised that these vulnerable people

00:27:47.250 --> 00:28:01.100
are very good for having as their disciples,
I should say, to make money, to befool them.

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:10.520
Now on this side, you have such a Great Power,
you are chosen for a, such a great thing,

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:19.880
and on the other side you have this kind of
slavery.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:27.070
So try to understand that your innate qualities
were lost. But luckily, by the Kundalini awakening

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:35.679
and by the breaking of the Sahastrara, all
these innate qualities which looked like lost:

00:28:35.679 --> 00:28:44.250
like your innocence, like your creativity,
like your religion within, like your compassion

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:57.570
and love for the humanity, like your power
of judgment, wisdom. All these great qualities

00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:05.260
which we thought were lost were nothing but
they were in a dormant state. They all got

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:09.620
awakened one by one.
I don’t have to tell you “Don’t drink

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:18.070
this! Don’t eat this! Don’t do that!”.
You yourself realise that this is wrong. You

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:25.220
yourself know what is good for you. And still
if you want to do wrong you can go ahead.

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:30.929
But already there is a light within you to
see for yourself what is good and what is

00:29:30.929 --> 00:29:37.080
bad. It has come because of this Sahastrara
being opened out to this – a new dimension

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:42.820
of new knowledge. And this is not new, it
is all innately built within you. Now all

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:50.600
those innate qualities are manifesting and
you are enjoying them.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:56.780
So now you have to get out of your petty ideas
and petty things. People are reporting to

00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:00.830
Me something very funny – I can’t believe
sahaja yogis can do like that – that they

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:05.791
run away with the plates that I have bought,
or they run away with the cups, they throw

00:30:05.791 --> 00:30:10.980
things here and there, all over the places
they are throwing things. How can you behave

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:19.460
like this? I mean this is so stupid and so
insipid. If you do not have a proper discipline

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:26.340
of life yourself, you cannot carry the Will
of God, you cannot. But I’m not going to

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:36.730
tell you “Do this or do that!” I respect
your freedom and I just want that your own

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:43.210
Kundalini should awaken that wisdom in you,
that greatness in you, that glory in you and

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:47.280
you start understanding what is our innate
quality.

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:54.390
So it will purify you. Once you are purified
completely, like you see, if you have some

00:30:54.390 --> 00:31:02.500
gold which is not pure you put it in the fire,
the gold is separated. In the same way, the

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:09.880
fire of Kundalini cleanses you completely,
makes you absolutely clean, and you start

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:18.400
seeing your own glory, your own nature, your
own greatness. So the integration part comes

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:29.710
to you easily. You start integrating.
First of all, we used to have sahaja yogis,

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:36.980
say from, some from England, some from Spain,
some from here. They would always have different

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:41.640
groups, they would never sit together. You
could make out this is English sitting here,

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:47.190
they are sitting here, they are sitting here,
and they would form a group. But now it’s

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:59.590
not so. Now I find they all are becoming integrated.
The integration of human beings is the most

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:08.809
important thing for Sahaja Yoga. That comes
by understanding, not by your intelligence,

00:32:08.809 --> 00:32:17.080
but by innate understanding that – all human
beings are made by God, by His will, and we

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:23.820
have no right to despise anyone.
The second integration that has come within

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:37.310
you is that all religions, all religions,
are born on the same tree of spiritual life.

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:48.840
That all religions are to be worshipped, all
incarnations, all prophets, all scriptures

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:55.770
are to be worshipped. There are defects, there
are problems with those scriptures which can

00:32:55.770 --> 00:33:00.420
be corrected.
So gradually you start entering into the subtler

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:08.080
side of Divinity, to understand that all these
people have worked hard to create, today,

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:14.590
the atmosphere for Sahaja Yoga, and no religion
is to be despised, and no religion is to be

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:26.850
attacked, which is a very, very, absolutely
a unreal thing and you are working out a very

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:32.990
unreal theory which doesn’t exist in the
Divine plan.

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:39.350
So this is how we finish all fundamentalism.
Fundamentalists are the ones who believed

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:44.610
that this is written in this book, this is
written in this book, and that we, because

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:51.220
we read this book, we are something better.
Anybody can read any book, what is so great?

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:57.460
Same, I would say, in Sahaja Yoga people should
not become fundamentalist. Be very careful!

00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:01.590
Because that’s what you are – born like
that, I mean, I don’t know, it’s not your

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:06.919
innate quality but the way you are made that
way, you have fashioned yourself that way,

00:34:06.919 --> 00:34:13.470
that you start also making Sahaja Yoga sometimes
a fundamental. “Mother said so.”

00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:21.620
Do not use Me anywhere! “Mother said so!”
Is a way you want to dominate others. You

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:27.040
yourself say because now you have a right,
you have an individuality in Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:33.429
You can say what you have to say yourself,
but don’t say that “Mother has said it!”

00:34:33.429 --> 00:34:41.590
Because anybody can start it, like that: “Christ
said it!”. A clergyman or, a say, pope can

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:51.800
stand up on his own platform and say that
Christ has said it. They can just arbitrarily

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.500
use all these things.

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:59.950
So nobody has business to use Me arbitrarily.
Whatever you have to say you say yourself.

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:05.220
But don’t ever quote Me as that: “Mother
has said it,” or, “In this book such and

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:10.670
such is written, so this is the line, that
is important.” You are not bound by any

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:16.731
line, by whatever I say. It is you who has
to stand up and see for yourself what you

00:35:16.731 --> 00:35:25.420
have to say, because you have to use now your
will and for that you have to develop yourself

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:32.320
to have Pure Will, the Pure Desire of God
Almighty.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:40.691
The integration not only outward, but inward.
Like first of all, whatever we did, our mind

00:35:40.691 --> 00:35:47.480
used to say one thing, our heart used to say
another thing, our brain used to say another

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:56.800
thing. Now what has happened that all these
3 things have become one. So, whatever your

00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:04.950
brain says is absolutely acceptable to your
heart, absolutely acceptable to your attention.

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:10.480
So you yourself, you have become now integrated.
Many people write “Mother I want to do it,

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:15.630
but I can’t do it,” “Mother it was my
desire to do it, but I can’t do it.” Not

00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:23.760
now. Now you are completely integrated and
you can easily do the whole thing very well.

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:32.330
If you want to examine yourself, you should
try to find out “Am I integrated or not?

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:37.800
Whatever I’m doing, am I doing with my full
heart or not, with my full attention or not?”

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:45.180
I’ve seen that you do with full heart and
full intelligence but full attention is not

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:51.599
there. Still the attention, which is the first
thing that was enlightened, is not fully used.

00:36:51.599 --> 00:37:03.510
So the whole attention should be absolutely
there, that, “I have to do this thing with

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:10.080
full attention.” Otherwise, the integration
is not complete, integration is partial. So

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:26.460
these three things have to be completely integrated.
So the integration of all the chakras comes

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:37.370
in. Like whatever you do, has to be auspicious.
Whatever you do has to be with full attention.

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:47.040
Whatever you do has to be absolutely religious.
So like that, all these centres are being

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:55.430
absolutely, one integrated power that you
have. So the whole life should be integrated.

00:37:55.430 --> 00:38:00.620
Now, say somebody’s husband is not that
level or somebody’s wife is not of that

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:06.790
level, you shouldn’t bother. You should
just bother about yourself. Don’t expect

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:13.770
anything from anybody else. It is your duty
which is important. You have to fulfill your

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:23.790
duty and you have to work it out yourself.
Unless and until you understand that it is

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:27.109
your individual being which has achieved it,
and it’s the individual being which has

00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:32.500
to realise it, is the individual being that
has to become one, integrated with the rest

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:37.070
of them.
If you start putting things, like many a times

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:42.140
I’ve seen [that] if I say something people
start thinking that I am saying for somebody

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:50.330
else, they never take it for themselves. So,
not we have to see what is my gain: “I’ve

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:56.369
got financial gain,” say, “I’ve got
physical gains, I’ve got mental gains, I’ve

00:38:56.369 --> 00:39:06.400
got joy, happiness,” that’s not the only
thing. That should not be the only criteria.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:16.619
But what you should have is the understanding
of your own personality which is being specially

00:39:16.619 --> 00:39:26.390
fashioned [through] many, many lives for you
to come in this life to get your Realisation,

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:38.370
to do the further work of Will of God.
Every moment when you see a miracle taking

00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:44.400
place, you do realise that it’s all done
by Paramchaitanya. But what is Paramchaitanya

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:52.631
– is the will of Adi Shakti. And what is
Adi Shakti – is the Will of God. So, is

00:39:52.631 --> 00:40:02.300
all, whatever is done, is all ‘fixed entities’,
we can call them, or these vibrations are

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:13.620
like, we can say, DNA tapes. They all know
how they have to fashion you.

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:21.349
See, today it’s very sunny. Everybody is
surprised how can they have. So many things

00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:26.910
happen like this. The other day, we had havan,
it was absolutely sunny. So the whole Cosmos

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:33.460
is working for you. You are on the stage now
and you have to see to it, but if you don’t

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:44.450
have faith in yourself, if you are not confident
as to what you are, how can you help? How

00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:52.240
can you work out yourself and work out all
the problems of the world, which are created

00:40:52.240 --> 00:41:00.080
only by human beings?
So we have to absolutely overthrow all these

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:06.430
dominations on us. First from science. We
can prove everything that Sahaja Yoga, whatever

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:14.380
it has said about science, has been proved.
So, we can throw science which is just always,

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:18.330
all the time, in the flux, it’s changing
all the time.

00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:24.730
Then the so-called religions that we have.
So-called religions because people who have

00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:30.030
been Catholics, who have been Protestants,
who have been Hindus or Muslims, or this and

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:37.450
that, they all have got that thing on their
heads. And this has to be thrown away. We

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:44.180
have to become a new personality. After Realisation,
as I said, you become like a lotuses is from

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:49.510
the mud.
So now you have become lotuses and the lotuses

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:56.870
have to throw away all this dead mud, otherwise
fragrance won’t be there. That, one has

00:41:56.870 --> 00:42:10.940
to achieve: is to throw away all these shackles
which are, which are killing you, which are

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:22.810
of no use, but a burden. And beautiful lotuses
as you are you have to understand that the

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:34.740
whole fashioning has been done so carefully,
with such sweetness, with such delicacy.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:43.970
So first of all we must have respect for ourselves,
we must have affection and love for others

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:53.320
and we must have respect, means we must have
discipline. We have to have the discipline

00:42:53.320 --> 00:43:00.890
because if you respect yourself you’ll definitely
discipline yourself and you’ll make it available.

00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:10.580
Now as you can realise, that from My life
itself, that I work very hard, travel a lot,

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:20.700
much more than any one of you can do. Because
I have the will that – I have to bring this

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:30.010
world to that state of enjoyment, to that
state of happiness, to that state of Divinity,

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:38.369
where they realise what is their glory, what
is the glory of their Father.

00:43:38.369 --> 00:43:45.020
So I work very hard and I never even think
that something will go wrong with Me, or “This

00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:50.160
will happen”, “What will happen?” I
never have bothered you about My family life,

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:56.220
about My children, about anyone. Whatever
problems I had, I am dealing with them Myself.

00:43:56.220 --> 00:44:01.410
But here I get such big, big letters from
sahaja yogis, writing about their daughter,

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:08.010
their son, this thing, that thing.
Another thing is attachment to family is the

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:12.540
biggest burden on your heads and all the time
you are worried about your children, you are

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:13.540
worried about this, you are worried about
that. That’s not your responsibility. Please

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:20.010
try to understand. That’s the responsibility
of God Almighty. You can’t do better than

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:28.480
Him can you? But when you try to take the
responsibility He says “All right, look

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:32.859
after!” and the problems start.
‘Detachment’ is the word one should understand

00:44:32.859 --> 00:44:38.230
in a proper sense. When I ask people why do
you throw things here and there, say “We

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:41.490
are detached!”- wonderful way! And what
about your children? You cling on to them.

00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:44.300
What about your own things? You cling on to
them. For a small little thing, they’ll

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:48.670
bother My head. And, when it belongs to Me
or to Sahaja Yoga, then they’ll have a very

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:57.660
nice time with it – and throw it away, wherever
they feel like. I mean this kind of irresponsibility!

00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:05.070
How can you call them divine? How can they
be saintly people? Saintly people not only

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:12.540
are responsible for themselves, but for everyone.
Very slowly, smoothly, sweetly, with great

00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:19.839
affection, I have brought you to this level.
I didn’t ask you to go to Himalayas or stand

00:45:19.839 --> 00:45:23.785
on your heads or to donate all your properties
to Me. Nothing of the kind. We have managed

00:45:23.785 --> 00:45:27.880
it in a very, very beautiful manner. Now further,
when you have to go further, then you have

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:35.810
to understand that your duties are to be fulfilled
by you and by nobody else. But these duties

00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:42.230
are done by you, are towards your family,
towards your house, towards this, towards

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:49.089
that. No duties towards Sahaja Yoga.
So when you were, before Sahaja Yoga, you

00:45:49.089 --> 00:45:58.370
were not attached to anyone, in the sense
– you were only attached to yourself, self-centered.

00:45:58.370 --> 00:46:04.490
Now you have widened yourself a little more,
that now you are attached to your wife, to

00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:09.280
your children. But that’s just the same.
That is also selfish, because they are your

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:17.560
children, you think. They are not your children,
they are the children of God.

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:19.701
I hope all of you are intelligent enough to
understand your responsibility and work it

00:46:19.701 --> 00:46:20.701
out.
This is a very important thing that has happened

00:46:20.701 --> 00:46:21.701
to you that Sahastrara has opened. Now you
can prove the existence of God, His Will,

00:46:21.701 --> 00:46:22.701
everything, to the whole world. Nobody can
challenge Sahaja Yoga. Those scientist who

00:46:22.701 --> 00:46:23.701
will challenge can be told. Anybody, whether
you’re a scientist, economist, politician,

00:46:23.701 --> 00:46:24.701
anything, everything can be explained in the
light of Sahaja Yoga and can be proved that

00:46:24.701 --> 00:46:25.701
there’s only one politics – that is of
God, one economics – that is of God, and

00:46:25.701 --> 00:46:26.701
there is only one religion – that is of
God, is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. It can be proved,

00:46:26.701 --> 00:46:27.701
there’s nothing to be afraid of or to worry
about.

00:46:27.701 --> 00:46:28.701
This all can be proved to the scientist and
to the other intellectuals and to some few

00:46:28.701 --> 00:46:29.701
people if they want to listen to us. If they
don’t want to listen to us, forget it. Because

00:46:29.701 --> 00:46:30.701
we are so powerful, why should you worry about
them? But, if they are willing to listen to

00:46:30.701 --> 00:46:31.701
us, then is better that we tell them “Now
we have discovered this Great Power”, and

00:46:31.701 --> 00:46:32.701
if it works out, if this Great Power works
out then only we can really fashion the whole

00:46:32.701 --> 00:46:33.701
world in a new way.
I have great hopes from you people, but the

00:46:33.701 --> 00:46:34.701
seriousness with which you should take Sahaja
Yoga, for example even meditation, people

00:46:34.701 --> 00:46:35.701
don’t do. Simple thing like meditation,
you people don’t do, I can’t understand.

00:46:35.701 --> 00:46:36.701
How will you grow without meditation?
Unless and until you become thoughtlessly

00:46:36.701 --> 00:46:37.701
aware you cannot grow. So you have to, you
have to at least meditate morning, evening.

00:46:37.701 --> 00:46:38.701
There are many people who are not even collective
by temperament. If they are staying in an

00:46:38.701 --> 00:46:39.701
ashram they just think that ashram life is
no good. Such people should really get out

00:46:39.701 --> 00:46:40.701
of Sahaja Yoga, because they have not yet
understood what this Sahaja Yoga is. Without

00:46:40.701 --> 00:46:41.701
collectivity how will you grow? How will you
assemble your power? You see? You know very

00:46:41.701 --> 00:46:42.701
well that in a sangha, in a group, in combining
together only, you can be strong. Is a fact

00:46:42.701 --> 00:46:43.701
that if you have one stick you can break it,
but if you put many sticks together you cannot

00:46:43.701 --> 00:46:44.701
break it.
But there are still people I know who are

00:46:44.701 --> 00:46:45.701
still not so much in collectivity. Shows how
poor they are in their understanding of their

00:46:45.701 --> 00:46:46.701
own Self, and they are telling Me that “Mother,
we don’t want to stay in the Ashram now

00:46:46.701 --> 00:46:47.701
anywhere more.” So they should get out of
Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:47.701 --> 00:46:48.701
Without the collectivity, you cannot grow.
Without the discipline of Sahaja Yoga, you

00:46:48.701 --> 00:46:49.701
cannot grow. It’s better to have ten people
of good quality than to have thousand useless

00:46:49.701 --> 00:46:50.701
people. That’s what is the Will of God.
So now, as you are today here, so many people,

00:46:50.701 --> 00:46:54.359
I am really enamoured to see so many people
are there. And we have done so much of our

00:46:54.359 --> 00:46:59.680
growth and grown out of all those nonsensical
things that we were following.

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:08.760
But today we have to take a vow that – “I’ll
now fashion my life according to the Will

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:18.580
of God. Absolutely. And dedicate myself to
that.” No family, no other considerations.

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:25.800
Just forget it! Nothing so important. Everything
can be looked after by Will of God. So if

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:31.990
you just try to follow the Will of God, your
children will be looked after, everything

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:38.900
will be looked after, you don’t have to
worry for anything. And that works. Just try

00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:43.640
to understand that you have problems because
you don’t want to give those problems to

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:47.970
God, you want to keep it to themselves, that’s
why you have problems. If you decide that

00:47:47.970 --> 00:47:56.450
“No, I just want to give these problems
to the God’s will,” Finished!

00:47:56.450 --> 00:48:02.130
Also there are some who want to say that “We
are not so capable Mother, we can’t do it.”

00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:13.310
Saying like this also is stupid. You test
yourself, you see for yourself. So first of

00:48:13.310 --> 00:48:20.609
all, one has to understand why do we say such
a thing? Maybe that we are very money-oriented,

00:48:20.609 --> 00:48:25.820
that we want to have money to ourselves, or
something like that. Or some people are there

00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:32.940
who talk of business also in Sahaja Yoga.
There must be something like a money orientation,

00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:38.410
or some sort of a material attachment that
they say that ‘We are not capable, we cannot

00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:43.230
change.”
The second could be this mamatwa as they call

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:50.930
it. The attachment to your family, children,
this, that. Or, ‘This is mine, this is mine,

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:57.130
this is mine.” This could be the second
reason that you think that you are not bold

00:48:57.130 --> 00:49:02.990
enough or you are not strong enough to do
Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:11.460
Thirdly could be that you are still playing
with your old habits and that you are enjoying

00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:19.310
your life without virtues. There can be some
reason like that. So just try to locate, “Why

00:49:19.310 --> 00:49:31.560
am I behaving like this? Why am I not getting
into the same beautiful path of my ascent

00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:37.510
as everybody has got it.” If we introspect,
you’ll find out that “There’s something

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:45.410
wrong with me that I think I am not capable
of doing.” You are capable of doing everything!

00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:53.410
You just try this and enjoy it.
So, most important thing now [that] remains

00:49:53.410 --> 00:50:05.920
is that you should become a proper, strong,
compassionate vehicle of God’s Will. So.

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:11.590
Then, what is most important of course, I
agree, that you do My puja, because that helps

00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:20.400
you a lot, no doubt. But other things are
not important. So many other things you people

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:29.880
tell Me is not of importance. Main thing is
that you should all ascend higher and higher

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:34.330
and compete with each other in getting into
higher situation.

00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:43.030
As it is, I think in such a short time we
have achieved a lot, no doubt, but still we

00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:50.470
have to speed up and work it out. I am sure
that this new science, or we can say, the,

00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:57.740
which is the absolute science will one day
outshadow the other science, and tell people

00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:03.320
that: this is what it is. It is in your hands,
you work it out.

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:14.599
So today is the day we are celebrate by which
we have opened absolutely a new dimension,

00:51:14.599 --> 00:51:26.630
absolutely a venue of great Divinity, of the
proofs of Divine. And this is something so

00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:39.710
great that we can really finish all the illusions
they have about themselves, about their ego.

00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:47.310
We can manage them. That power you all have.
May God Bless You.
