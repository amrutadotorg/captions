00:00:00.297 --> 00:00:07.526
It’s a great pleasure that from all over the world

00:00:07.727 --> 00:00:14.750
people have gathered to worship Shiva.

00:00:14.951 --> 00:00:18.556
Actually we should say it is Sadashiva

00:00:18.757 --> 00:00:23.569
that we are going to worship today.

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:34.221
As you know the difference between Sadashiva and Shri Shiva.

00:00:34.422 --> 00:00:44.590
Sadashiva is the God Almighty

00:00:44.791 --> 00:00:54.404
and He is a witness of the play of the Primordial Mother.

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:04.099
The combination between

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.919
Sadashiva and the Primordial Mother Adi Shakti

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.060
is just like a moon and the moonlight

00:01:15.261 --> 00:01:18.263
or the sun or the sunlight.

00:01:18.464 --> 00:01:21.771
We cannot understand such relationship in human being,

00:01:21.972 --> 00:01:28.456
among human marriages or among human relationships.

00:01:33.564 --> 00:01:38.957
So whatever the Adi Shakti’s creating,

00:01:39.158 --> 00:01:44.113
which is the desire of Sadashiva,

00:01:44.314 --> 00:01:49.407
is being witnessed by Him.

00:01:50.017 --> 00:01:56.587
And when He is watching this creation

00:01:56.845 --> 00:02:05.804
He is witnessing all of it into all details.

00:02:06.547 --> 00:02:13.682
He witnesses the whole universe

00:02:13.883 --> 00:02:19.409
and He also witnesses this Mother Earth,

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.883
all the creation that is done by the Adi Shakti.

00:02:27.561 --> 00:02:32.904
His power is of witnessing

00:02:33.105 --> 00:02:41.070
and the power of Adi Shakti

00:02:41.271 --> 00:02:46.888
is this all pervading power of love.

00:02:49.051 --> 00:02:57.328
So the God Almighty, the Father, the Primordial Father, we can say,

00:02:57.529 --> 00:03:02.837
expresses His desire, His Iccha Shakti

00:03:03.038 --> 00:03:12.164
as the Primordial Mother and She expresses Her power as love.

00:03:13.427 --> 00:03:24.766
So the relationship between the two is extremely understanding,

00:03:24.967 --> 00:03:28.063
very deep,

00:03:28.264 --> 00:03:32.758
and whatever She‘s creating,

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:39.055
if She finds, if He finds there is some problem

00:03:39.256 --> 00:03:44.813
or there are people, human beings specially

00:03:45.014 --> 00:03:49.876
who are trying to obstruct Her work,

00:03:50.077 --> 00:03:56.970
or even the Gods who are not the deities

00:03:57.171 --> 00:04:02.173
are trying to express their egos,

00:04:02.374 --> 00:04:08.217
He is the one who brings forth their destruction.

00:04:09.804 --> 00:04:17.382
So He is the one who is responsible for the destructive power

00:04:18.116 --> 00:04:24.817
He is reflected in the hearts of human beings,

00:04:25.018 --> 00:04:30.512
among all the creations He pulsates.

00:04:30.713 --> 00:04:36.231
But that pulses, pulsation is the energy

00:04:36.432 --> 00:04:41.051
of the Primordial Mother.

00:04:41.252 --> 00:04:47.114
And He can destroy anything that goes against the plans

00:04:47.315 --> 00:04:50.347
of the Adi Shakti.

00:04:50.548 --> 00:04:58.227
Adi Shakti is love, She forgives and She loves.

00:04:58.428 --> 00:05:05.122
She loves her creation. She wants the creation to prosper,

00:05:05.323 --> 00:05:09.895
to go up to the same level for which it was created.

00:05:10.096 --> 00:05:17.810
She wants human beings to go to that level

00:05:18.011 --> 00:05:22.724
where they enter into the Kingdom of God,

00:05:22.925 --> 00:05:27.404
Kingdom of Sadashiva where there is bliss,

00:05:27.605 --> 00:05:32.792
there is forgiveness, there’s joy.

00:05:34.097 --> 00:05:42.350
All this is only possible if you have seeking,

00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:53.262
that you have also a innate desire to be there.

00:05:54.074 --> 00:05:59.076
This desire within us is reflected

00:05:59.277 --> 00:06:04.326
as the reflection of the Primordial Mother.

00:06:04.527 --> 00:06:07.389
Now this desire is there

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.186
and other mundane desires are also there

00:06:11.387 --> 00:06:17.676
which stop the progress of your ascent.

00:06:18.942 --> 00:06:25.194
In Sahaja Yoga we have never tried

00:06:25.395 --> 00:06:29.046
to overcome the desires by taking sanyasa

00:06:29.247 --> 00:06:33.874
or running away from the house or for all kinds of things

00:06:34.075 --> 00:06:36.075
that has been suggested.

00:06:36.276 --> 00:06:40.263
The first thing that is done is that

00:06:40.464 --> 00:06:43.740
you get the light of your spirit.

00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:47.935
Spirit is the reflection of Sadashiva.

00:06:48.136 --> 00:06:51.958
In that light He shows, He is just showing the path.

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:58.028
The spirit is just like a light which is burning

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:01.926
and which is showing the path.

00:07:02.127 --> 00:07:08.114
In that path you yourself become so wise

00:07:08.315 --> 00:07:13.160
that you walk in the light of wisdom,

00:07:13.361 --> 00:07:17.160
that you walk in the light of righteousness.

00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:21.090
Because whatever is destructive is seen

00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:24.043
through the light of your spirit.

00:07:24.244 --> 00:07:29.113
You start giving up all that is destructive.

00:07:29.314 --> 00:07:33.238
Nobody has to tell you that give up this, give up that.

00:07:33.439 --> 00:07:39.246
You yourself realize that this is wrong and we should give up.

00:07:39.447 --> 00:07:47.884
This was, I should say, my own understanding of human beings

00:07:48.085 --> 00:07:51.618
because these are the days where people are

00:07:51.819 --> 00:07:55.766
in complete illusions.

00:07:55.967 --> 00:08:01.016
They are in a conflict all the time struggling even to exist.

00:08:01.217 --> 00:08:05.594
Under these circumstances, everything would have failed

00:08:05.795 --> 00:08:09.631
if you had started with taking a sanyasa

00:08:09.832 --> 00:08:12.561
and then going to Himalayas and all that.

00:08:12.762 --> 00:08:16.663
If you have to do this for the masses,

00:08:16.864 --> 00:08:19.632
something has to be done radical

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:24.030
and luckily I’ve been able to find out a way

00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:33.418
by which you can get your sprouting, your Realization.

00:08:33.619 --> 00:08:36.707
Now some people who get Realization

00:08:36.908 --> 00:08:42.582
have to understand certain things because as you know

00:08:42.783 --> 00:08:46.746
there are many people who have got Realization.

00:08:46.947 --> 00:08:50.660
I don't know how many, I don't keep count.

00:08:50.861 --> 00:08:57.478
But what is lacking in them is surrendering.

00:08:59.718 --> 00:09:03.939
It’s embarrassing to say but is a fact.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:10.103
This is the only condition of modern Sahaja Yoga

00:09:10.304 --> 00:09:13.626
that you have to really surrender.

00:09:13.827 --> 00:09:16.345
If you start using your brain,

00:09:16.546 --> 00:09:21.579
if you start using other methods to understand Sahaja Yoga,

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:26.024
you cannot. You must surrender

00:09:26.225 --> 00:09:29.947
and as Islam is nothing but surrender,

00:09:30.148 --> 00:09:33.236
Islam means surrender.

00:09:33.437 --> 00:09:39.658
And if that surrender is not there

00:09:39.859 --> 00:09:49.359
it is impossible to establish anyone in the Kingdom of God.

00:09:52.061 --> 00:09:59.417
Surrender is not that you should give up your family,

00:09:59.618 --> 00:10:05.433
give up your children, or give up your houses and homes

00:10:05.634 --> 00:10:10.003
and your properties. Surrendering is here:

00:10:10.204 --> 00:10:13.105
give up your ego to begin with

00:10:13.306 --> 00:10:16.722
and then give up your conditionings.

00:10:16.923 --> 00:10:20.925
For example, the other day I met one gentleman

00:10:21.126 --> 00:10:24.261
and he is suffering a lot.

00:10:24.462 --> 00:10:27.464
So I asked him, "Who is your Guru?",

00:10:27.665 --> 00:10:31.245
so he gave Me one name of a Guru.

00:10:31.446 --> 00:10:36.073
I said, "He’s not done any good to you,

00:10:36.274 --> 00:10:40.089
will you give him up?" He said, "Tomorrow."

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:43.581
I said, "Why not today?" He said, "Today,

00:10:43.782 --> 00:10:46.604
but I have to throw away all his things.

00:10:46.805 --> 00:10:49.838
So tomorrow morning I will do it." I said, "All right, do it."

00:10:50.039 --> 00:10:53.377
"What should I throw away Mother?" I said,

00:10:53.578 --> 00:10:55.578
"Then all the things with which you worshipped him,

00:10:55.779 --> 00:10:59.601
throw away, throw away."

00:10:59.802 --> 00:11:01.802
Then he went around the whole house,

00:11:02.003 --> 00:11:06.380
found out whatever was there which was used

00:11:06.581 --> 00:11:10.521
for worshipping him, everything he gathered together,

00:11:10.722 --> 00:11:13.748
threw in the sea.

00:11:13.949 --> 00:11:18.334
And then he told the sea that, “I am sorry

00:11:18.535 --> 00:11:21.022
I have suffered a lot because of this man,

00:11:21.223 --> 00:11:24.881
now you please don't suffer.”

00:11:25.082 --> 00:11:29.764
So this kind of a very penetrating intelligence

00:11:29.965 --> 00:11:35.629
if you don't have you cannot give up.

00:11:36.464 --> 00:11:40.639
One sticks to that. I know of so many

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.840
who find it so difficult to get rid of their conditionings.

00:11:43.832 --> 00:11:48.240
That’s more difficult than ego.

00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:52.131
Mundane conditionings and condition schemes that you have.

00:11:52.332 --> 00:11:56.846
We have first conditioning that supposing you are born

00:11:57.047 --> 00:12:01.018
in India or England or any place.

00:12:01.219 --> 00:12:04.299
After Sahaja Yoga I’ve seen most of the people

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.885
they suddenly start seeing what’s wrong with their countrymen,

00:12:08.086 --> 00:12:11.268
what’s wrong with their country, what’s wrong with their religion,

00:12:11.469 --> 00:12:14.409
what’s wrong with the books they were reading.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:17.362
Immediately they start seeing it clearly,

00:12:17.563 --> 00:12:21.729
that this was the mistake, this is wrong.

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:25.885
They all make fun of them. I’ve seen people all over the world.

00:12:26.086 --> 00:12:32.513
Nobody says that ‘No, no, no, no, because we are English

00:12:32.714 --> 00:12:35.435
we are the best, we are Russians so we are the best,

00:12:35.636 --> 00:12:37.755
or we are Indians we are the best’.

00:12:37.956 --> 00:12:40.747
Immediately they find out what’s wrong with them

00:12:40.948 --> 00:12:44.247
and why these people are not getting Realization.

00:12:44.448 --> 00:12:47.524
On the other hand they feel such compassion

00:12:47.725 --> 00:12:50.782
that ‘Mother so many people haven't got their Realization.

00:12:50.983 --> 00:12:54.696
Why shouldn't we try to give them Realization?’

00:12:54.897 --> 00:12:59.368
This is the double action of this light.

00:12:59.569 --> 00:13:03.087
Firstly you know that there is light

00:13:03.288 --> 00:13:06.173
and that you have become the light.

00:13:06.374 --> 00:13:11.782
So wherever your attention goes you start seeing reality

00:13:11.983 --> 00:13:16.235
and then you understand that this has been the conditioning

00:13:16.436 --> 00:13:20.915
of our country, of our society.

00:13:21.116 --> 00:13:24.829
And then they abhor all that is wrong,

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:27.462
they never identify with it.

00:13:27.663 --> 00:13:31.993
But first thing as I said, is surrendering.

00:13:32.194 --> 00:13:36.846
In surrendering actually you develop

00:13:37.047 --> 00:13:42.299
a kind of a state where I would say

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:49.960
you become a sanyasi, from within.

00:13:50.258 --> 00:13:53.280
That means nothing can dominate you,

00:13:53.481 --> 00:13:59.827
what is a sanyasi is a person who is above everything else.

00:14:00.028 --> 00:14:03.866
Nothing can stick to him.

00:14:04.067 --> 00:14:10.108
He just looks at things and he knows what it is.

00:14:10.309 --> 00:14:13.389
He may not say, he knows everything

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:16.944
and he doesn't do whatever is wrong.

00:14:17.145 --> 00:14:22.327
He’s so detached, that in that detachment only he can see

00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:25.882
what’s wrong with him. He starts seeing his family people,

00:14:26.083 --> 00:14:28.765
he starts seeing other surroundings,

00:14:28.966 --> 00:14:33.382
everywhere he starts seeing what’s wrong.

00:14:33.591 --> 00:14:37.343
And he does not identify with them, is very surprising.

00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:41.507
I have seen it, I mean, I went to Turkey.

00:14:41.708 --> 00:14:44.624
In Turkey I met one gentleman who was running

00:14:44.825 --> 00:14:49.038
a big Swiss hotel and he came himself to Me

00:14:49.239 --> 00:14:52.541
and said Mother give me Realization. I was surprised

00:14:52.742 --> 00:14:56.948
because I didn't see this in Switzerland such a anxious personality

00:14:57.149 --> 00:15:00.425
would ask for Realization, very surprising that in Turkey

00:15:00.626 --> 00:15:04.917
he should ask for Realization. And I gave him Realization

00:15:05.118 --> 00:15:10.511
and immediately he said, "I am not going to go back to Switzerland.”

00:15:10.712 --> 00:15:15.267
Just imagine! It’s, you see, it is so clear-cut

00:15:15.468 --> 00:15:20.025
that this light definitely gives you tremendous wisdom

00:15:20.226 --> 00:15:22.470
and balance.

00:15:22.671 --> 00:15:27.142
Supposing you are walking and you can't see the road,

00:15:27.343 --> 00:15:31.244
you may fall down. But if there’s little light also you can see it.

00:15:31.445 --> 00:15:36.728
And this is what Sahaja Yoga has done, is given you very little light.

00:15:36.929 --> 00:15:40.447
That little light itself has been sufficient for you to give up

00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:47.093
so many things. Now the other side of it is the ego part.

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:52.447
Ego is very subtle stuff with human beings.

00:15:52.648 --> 00:15:56.752
I don't know how they gather it, but they do

00:15:56.953 --> 00:16:00.600
and some of them have such a gullible ego

00:16:00.801 --> 00:16:04.514
that with the slightest thing it shoots off.

00:16:04.715 --> 00:16:08.084
And they get very angry for small things

00:16:08.285 --> 00:16:11.514
or if they find somebody whom they can dominate,

00:16:11.715 --> 00:16:14.725
they can dominate also that person.

00:16:14.926 --> 00:16:17.780
Now this ego when you start seeing it,

00:16:17.981 --> 00:16:20.952
you just start laughing at yourself

00:16:21.153 --> 00:16:24.366
and think that, what’s wrong with me.

00:16:24.567 --> 00:16:29.468
Ego is not like conditioning which is coming from outside

00:16:29.669 --> 00:16:32.320
but ego is something that comes from within.

00:16:32.521 --> 00:16:35.883
It can come from anything. Human beings

00:16:36.084 --> 00:16:39.422
have ego of all kinds of nonsensical things.

00:16:39.623 --> 00:16:43.531
One day I met one lady and she was very proud

00:16:43.732 --> 00:16:45.945
and was not even smiling.

00:16:46.146 --> 00:16:50.179
I said, "What’s the matter with this lady, what is she?"

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.380
So they told Me, "She knows how to make dolls

00:16:52.581 --> 00:16:55.083
that’s why she’s so proud.” I said,

00:16:55.284 --> 00:16:58.060
“Eh, to make dolls, she’s so proud!”

00:16:58.261 --> 00:17:02.685
"Yes, you know, she can make dolls, so she’s so proud."

00:17:02.886 --> 00:17:05.849
I said, "What is there, anybody can make dolls,

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:09.005
so what is so great?" "No, but she thinks she is very great

00:17:09.206 --> 00:17:10.698
because she makes dolls."

00:17:10.899 --> 00:17:14.620
So a man becomes stupid and stupid.

00:17:14.821 --> 00:17:18.253
That is first sign of a egoistical person.

00:17:18.454 --> 00:17:21.639
He is so stupid that when you are talking to him,

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:25.241
you just get flabbergasted that without paying anything

00:17:25.442 --> 00:17:29.233
you have got a buffoon before you who is showing all joke,

00:17:29.434 --> 00:17:33.233
jokes of his buffoonery.

00:17:33.434 --> 00:17:37.881
Is something very surprising, I mean, you meet any egoistical person

00:17:38.082 --> 00:17:43.592
and you just watch him: “I did this, I am, I, I, I ...”

00:17:43.793 --> 00:17:46.325
Then you start seeing the person, what’s the matter,

00:17:46.526 --> 00:17:51.458
he’s not even ashamed to say things that should not be said.

00:17:51.659 --> 00:17:55.692
Then it goes even to the sinful life they lead.

00:17:55.893 --> 00:17:58.708
They lead a very sinful life, they fond of women,

00:17:58.909 --> 00:18:01.810
they drink and this and that.

00:18:02.011 --> 00:18:04.482
Then they start boasting about that also:

00:18:04.683 --> 00:18:08.912
“I drank that day so much; I had five women around me.”

00:18:09.113 --> 00:18:13.389
They start boasting of that also. So, for a egoistical man

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:17.020
there is nothing like shame. He’ll go on telling about

00:18:17.221 --> 00:18:19.715
his nonsensical things and everybody will say

00:18:19.916 --> 00:18:22.504
‘My God with whom are we talking?’

00:18:22.705 --> 00:18:28.701
And then, whatever they do they justify. I asked one fellow,

00:18:28.902 --> 00:18:32.209
"You had such a bad heart attack why do you drink now,

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:36.178
give up drinking." He said, "But even this person Kirloskar” -

00:18:36.379 --> 00:18:41.311
we have one in Poona who is now, I think, 95 – “he drinks”.

00:18:41.512 --> 00:18:45.155
So I said, "You are not Kirloskar, and even if he drinks,

00:18:45.356 --> 00:18:48.249
what’s the use, what is he gaining by that?"

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:52.569
"No, no, you see he’s very good, because, see, he drinks

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:54.770
and he’s so successful."

00:18:54.971 --> 00:18:58.583
"Is he successful without, because of drinking?"

00:18:58.784 --> 00:19:04.224
But even ordinary reasoning is not there, ordinary reasoning.

00:19:04.425 --> 00:19:09.099
And in the general way if you see, even if you see

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:12.395
the greatest drunkard countries, I have never seen

00:19:12.596 --> 00:19:17.418
a statue of a man who died of drinking, never.

00:19:17.619 --> 00:19:20.580
I’ve not seen in any country people are praising a man

00:19:20.781 --> 00:19:27.018
because he had ten women or he died of drinking. So far!

00:19:27.219 --> 00:19:31.284
I don't know how far human beings can go in their ego.

00:19:31.485 --> 00:19:34.979
Now this ego is spreading very much in modern times

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:42.680
where they start saying, "I like this, I don't like this".

00:19:43.676 --> 00:19:47.526
“What, what you don't like?” "I don't like this kind of a sari,

00:19:47.727 --> 00:19:50.807
I don't like this kind of clothes, I don't like this."

00:19:51.008 --> 00:19:54.799
But who are you, you are not going to see yourself, others are going to see.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.877
So what difference does it make whether you like it or not?

00:19:58.078 --> 00:20:03.299
But is very common with young people, to talk like that "I like."

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:07.760
And this is a sign of complete destruction.

00:20:07.961 --> 00:20:13.658
Because ego is not only, is, makes you stupid,

00:20:13.859 --> 00:20:16.447
you see all these days the way people dress up

00:20:16.648 --> 00:20:21.775
and we find they are very stupid because "I like it, so what?”

00:20:21.976 --> 00:20:24.611
Anything they like it, you know, if they want to walk on

00:20:24.812 --> 00:20:29.533
their heads "I like it, what’s wrong?”

00:20:29.734 --> 00:20:34.642
All kinds of stupidity can be explained through ego.

00:20:34.843 --> 00:20:38.822
So those who get Realization somehow or other,

00:20:39.023 --> 00:20:42.088
thank God, see it:

00:20:42.289 --> 00:20:46.377
This is my ego talking.

00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:49.916
Then they start laughing at themselves,

00:20:50.117 --> 00:20:55.760
making fun of themselves: This was my ego.

00:20:55.961 --> 00:20:59.158
But also in Sahaja Yoga there are people,

00:20:59.359 --> 00:21:01.359
I said, "Why don't you go and organize?"

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:05.609
"Mother because my ego will come up." I said, "What’s this?”

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:09.562
“My ego will come up so I don’t want to organize."

00:21:09.763 --> 00:21:13.046
How can your ego come up? If you see your ego,

00:21:13.247 --> 00:21:19.351
supposing you see, something is burning, you see it there.

00:21:19.552 --> 00:21:22.398
How can you get that burning onto yourself?

00:21:22.599 --> 00:21:29.734
But this is a very subtle type of, avoiding work of Sahaja Yoga

00:21:29.935 --> 00:21:32.586
to say that "No, I’ll get into ego." I said,

00:21:32.787 --> 00:21:38.109
"All right you get into ego, I’ll see to it, get in, what happens."

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:42.781
So all kinds of things there are which makes a person

00:21:42.982 --> 00:21:47.911
quite idiotic and stupid.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:54.227
I mean, I don't know how many things I can tell you today.

00:21:54.428 --> 00:21:59.430
But also I’ve seen in marriages this is very common.

00:21:59.631 --> 00:22:04.602
They’ll say that, ‘Mother, I married this girl at that time

00:22:04.803 --> 00:22:08.633
but now I don't think I should have been married.’

00:22:08.834 --> 00:22:11.797
Bah, bah, what, that time, what had happened to you,

00:22:12.014 --> 00:22:14.179
why didn't you marry at that time?

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:17.261
I have to tell you these things because I’ve been facing

00:22:17.462 --> 00:22:22.727
all kinds of problems of this stupid, idiotic ego.

00:22:23.329 --> 00:22:30.105
One has to see it clearly, how this ego is working in me

00:22:30.306 --> 00:22:35.535
and how it is keeping me down. So when we talk of ascent,

00:22:35.736 --> 00:22:41.473
we talk of a higher life. We have to become sanyasi

00:22:41.674 --> 00:22:45.387
like the lotus that comes out of the pond

00:22:45.588 --> 00:22:50.173
and no water can stay on them.

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:54.496
Even the leaves of lotus, no water can stay on them.

00:22:54.697 --> 00:22:56.697
Just like that we have to become.

00:22:56.898 --> 00:23:00.939
We don't have to wear sanyasis dresses, nothing of that.

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:07.822
But from inside, a kind of a detached attention is there

00:23:08.023 --> 00:23:15.543
which immediately locates the problem, within you and without.

00:23:15.744 --> 00:23:21.655
And also in Sahaja Yoga, you know how to overcome that.

00:23:21.856 --> 00:23:31.078
It’s a very effective, efficient system.

00:23:31.279 --> 00:23:35.087
But for that again, to achieve that

00:23:35.288 --> 00:23:41.048
you have to become Shiva within, means detached.

00:23:41.249 --> 00:23:46.321
As Shiva is completely detached, you have to be detached.

00:23:46.522 --> 00:23:52.891
And that detachment will give you the same wisdom as Shiva has.

00:23:53.092 --> 00:23:57.719
Shiva sees, we should say, Sadashiva sees

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:03.203
the work of Adi Shakti, silently. He doesn't get proud,

00:24:03.404 --> 00:24:06.625
he doesn't develop a kind of a ego

00:24:06.826 --> 00:24:11.953
‘Let me see now what my Iccha Shakti is doing’, nothing,

00:24:12.154 --> 00:24:14.711
he’s just watching.

00:24:14.912 --> 00:24:19.367
But when it comes to destruction,

00:24:19.568 --> 00:24:24.156
he sees that this part is going to destroy the work,

00:24:24.357 --> 00:24:29.445
immediately he destroys, removes that portion.

00:24:29.646 --> 00:24:32.351
In the same way we have to be,

00:24:32.552 --> 00:24:38.523
we have to see our life itself is a big field.

00:24:38.724 --> 00:24:44.765
How do we consider ourselves to be?

00:24:44.966 --> 00:24:48.421
I have seen people talk, "Oh, so what, I am a Sahaja Yogi!"

00:24:48.622 --> 00:24:53.465
You can't talk like that if you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:24:54.989 --> 00:25:00.186
With folded hands you have to say, “I am a Sahaja Yogi”.

00:25:00.387 --> 00:25:05.827
In your behavior, in your talk, in everything,

00:25:06.028 --> 00:25:13.238
you have to be a person who is extremely humble.

00:25:16.011 --> 00:25:23.675
If that is not so that means Sahaja Yoga has given you double ego.

00:25:24.721 --> 00:25:30.043
As it is you know that Shiva is known for his innocence,

00:25:30.244 --> 00:25:35.074
for his simplicity, his forgiveness. He forgives.

00:25:35.275 --> 00:25:38.543
He forgives rakshasas; he’ll forgive everyone

00:25:38.744 --> 00:25:40.744
that is his quality.

00:25:40.945 --> 00:25:46.347
But anybody who goes against the Primordial Mother,

00:25:46.548 --> 00:25:50.035
he doesn't spare.

00:25:50.236 --> 00:25:54.144
So this is his, the quality one has to understand,

00:25:54.345 --> 00:25:57.988
surrendering doesn't mean outside things to be surrendered.

00:25:58.189 --> 00:26:03.715
What is there, these are all stones, what are you surrendering?

00:26:03.916 --> 00:26:08.793
Surrendering means cleansing yourself completely,

00:26:08.994 --> 00:26:12.231
getting completely detached.

00:26:12.432 --> 00:26:18.189
Detachment is the only way you can rise.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:34.458
Some people get sick, they make such an ado out of it:

00:26:34.659 --> 00:26:40.028
“I am sick, the whole world should know I am sick, sick, sick, sick, sick.”

00:26:40.229 --> 00:26:44.623
But if you are a Sahaja Yogi, if you just watch,

00:26:44.824 --> 00:26:49.131
how so, I am sick, all right, let’s see.

00:26:49.332 --> 00:26:51.873
Just like a sport.

00:26:52.074 --> 00:26:54.881
Just watch.

00:26:55.082 --> 00:26:58.014
I am sick. So, what’s happening now?

00:26:58.215 --> 00:27:01.780
The temperature is coming nicely, now is going down,

00:27:01.989 --> 00:27:10.983
you just sort of a playful, mirthful attention.

00:27:11.702 --> 00:27:14.798
Ah, when I came I had temperature,

00:27:14.999 --> 00:27:17.540
but nobody believes I had temperature.

00:27:17.741 --> 00:27:20.493
I was so tired in the marriage they said, "You don’t look tired."

00:27:20.694 --> 00:27:23.556
I said, "All right, I’m not tired."

00:27:23.757 --> 00:27:28.306
In the same way, life also is to be played.

00:27:28.507 --> 00:27:32.931
It’s just a play, and that play has to be seen

00:27:33.132 --> 00:27:37.767
through the light of wisdom.

00:27:37.968 --> 00:27:43.150
Nothing is so serious, for Sahaja Yogis nothing is so serious.

00:27:43.351 --> 00:27:45.642
But he becomes very serious

00:27:45.843 --> 00:27:52.139
and he makes too much ado about himself.

00:27:52.687 --> 00:27:57.603
There are lots of things which we have to learn.

00:27:57.804 --> 00:28:00.759
When we worship Shiva, we praise him.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.353
You are this you are that, you are that.

00:28:03.554 --> 00:28:06.548
When you worship Me also you praise Me, you are this.

00:28:06.749 --> 00:28:08.855
I am not aware of all that that you say.

00:28:09.056 --> 00:28:11.894
But you say all right, if you say so, it’s all right.

00:28:12.095 --> 00:28:15.128
You are this you are that, the thousand names of Shiva,

00:28:15.329 --> 00:28:19.370
thousand name of the Goddess, thousand name of Vishnu.

00:28:19.571 --> 00:28:22.370
These are their names you are worshipping,

00:28:22.571 --> 00:28:25.706
what about you people,

00:28:25.907 --> 00:28:29.104
how many names you can have?

00:28:29.305 --> 00:28:34.971
Actually in the puja when you take the names of these Shaktis

00:28:35.172 --> 00:28:39.807
they also get awakened within, no doubt.

00:28:40.008 --> 00:28:46.687
After Puja you do feel that way but you don't utilize them.

00:28:47.305 --> 00:28:50.932
So many people I’ve seen have come in the Puja

00:28:51.133 --> 00:28:56.510
and they have got that power within themselves,

00:28:56.711 --> 00:28:59.198
same powers.

00:28:59.399 --> 00:29:04.409
But by the time they are out, it’s finished, it’s gone.

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:12.227
So, surrendering has another side: assumption.

00:29:14.286 --> 00:29:19.374
Assumption that I am a Sahaja Yogi

00:29:19.575 --> 00:29:25.944
and I can absorb all these powers within myself.

00:29:26.145 --> 00:29:30.014
So one side is surrendering.

00:29:30.215 --> 00:29:34.795
Why to surrender? To absorb.

00:29:34.996 --> 00:29:41.014
Automatically when you are surrendered you absorb.

00:29:41.215 --> 00:29:44.069
But once you have absorbed,

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:49.148
then you should retain and assume within yourself,

00:29:49.349 --> 00:29:53.836
know that you have these powers.

00:29:54.037 --> 00:29:59.813
There, where Sahaja Yogis fail more. First time it happened,

00:30:00.014 --> 00:30:04.102
no Sahaja Yogi would touch anybody raise anybody's Kundalini,

00:30:04.303 --> 00:30:08.610
this thing, that thing. We had at least fifty Sahaja Yogis by then.

00:30:08.811 --> 00:30:11.548
I said, "Now what to do, I have prepared these channels

00:30:11.749 --> 00:30:14.212
and nobody is even raising their fingers.

00:30:14.413 --> 00:30:18.790
How am I going to work it out?" Very difficult!

00:30:18.991 --> 00:30:23.017
But once it happened we had a program in Nasik Road

00:30:23.218 --> 00:30:25.218
and I was staying in Nasik.

00:30:25.419 --> 00:30:29.234
It’s about, I think, thirty miles from there.

00:30:29.435 --> 00:30:34.117
So, we reached halfway and our car failed

00:30:34.318 --> 00:30:40.953
and nobody no other car was coming, nothing, no support, nothing.

00:30:41.154 --> 00:30:43.549
I didn't know what to do.

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:47.338
But these, all the Sahaja Yogis had arrived there,

00:30:47.539 --> 00:30:51.111
and such a big crowd. They started saying, "When is Mataji coming?

00:30:51.312 --> 00:30:55.197
When is Mataji coming?" Such a pressure!

00:30:55.398 --> 00:30:58.463
So they said, "It’s all right, we’ll give you Realization, sit down."

00:30:58.664 --> 00:31:01.268
And they gave Realization.

00:31:01.469 --> 00:31:04.633
That’s the first time the Sahaja Yogis started knowing that

00:31:04.834 --> 00:31:09.485
they can give Realization, they can do this, they can do that.

00:31:09.686 --> 00:31:14.282
They all started after that.

00:31:14.483 --> 00:31:19.805
So assumption should be there, that I have these powers,

00:31:20.006 --> 00:31:23.610
I am not going to waste them, I am going to use them,

00:31:23.811 --> 00:31:28.563
I am going to look after others, I am not going to just keep to myself.

00:31:28.764 --> 00:31:31.586
This assumption has to come.

00:31:31.787 --> 00:31:34.227
Once I was traveling by ship

00:31:34.428 --> 00:31:37.571
and one fellow got caught up in the freeze room

00:31:37.772 --> 00:31:41.798
and he got pneumonia. So the captain came to Me

00:31:41.999 --> 00:31:44.217
‘That see this boy has got pneumonia,

00:31:44.418 --> 00:31:47.466
we have to get some doctor by helicopter.’ I said,

00:31:47.667 --> 00:31:50.435
"Captain, I’ve given you Realization, you are a doctor."

00:31:50.636 --> 00:31:54.154
He said "Who, I?” “Yes, you." "If you want, I can go down."

00:31:54.355 --> 00:31:57.099
"No, no, no, but tell me what to be done." I said "Just go

00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:00.904
and put your hand on his heart, finished."

00:32:01.105 --> 00:32:06.693
"I" he said. "Yes, you!" Went down and put his hand

00:32:06.894 --> 00:32:09.818
and the fellow got all right.

00:32:10.019 --> 00:32:13.310
He was amazed.

00:32:13.511 --> 00:32:18.060
He met Me now in the wedding – and he was amazed at himself.

00:32:18.261 --> 00:32:22.638
"This I can do to anyone?" "Yes, yes, you can!”

00:32:22.839 --> 00:32:26.324
But if you do not assume, and just sit down meditating,

00:32:26.525 --> 00:32:32.314
meditating, surrendering … what’s the use?

00:32:34.434 --> 00:32:38.916
So, you have to do,

00:32:39.117 --> 00:32:42.618
now after achieving Shiva state

00:32:42.819 --> 00:32:48.311
you have to start doing the work of Adi Shakti.

00:32:49.163 --> 00:32:54.798
You should get this desire that we should spread Sahaja Yoga,

00:32:54.999 --> 00:32:56.999
we have to work it out.

00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:00.257
But be careful sometimes you might be conditioned,

00:33:00.458 --> 00:33:03.351
you might be egotistical, watch yourself.

00:33:03.552 --> 00:33:08.046
With watching you can, I’m sure, you can achieve a lot.

00:33:08.247 --> 00:33:12.194
We have done, some people who have taken it upon themselves

00:33:12.395 --> 00:33:16.421
have done it, everywhere, in every country.

00:33:16.622 --> 00:33:21.741
So the first thing of surrendering is important

00:33:21.942 --> 00:33:26.952
to reach the state of your Spirit, of Shiva and Sadashiva.

00:33:27.153 --> 00:33:34.577
But the second state is that you have to now think of others.

00:33:35.418 --> 00:33:39.757
First it is as they say in Sanskrit is vyashti,

00:33:39.958 --> 00:33:44.366
means individual gain, you get the individual gain.

00:33:44.567 --> 00:33:51.186
And then it becomes samashti, means the collective.

00:33:51.387 --> 00:33:55.624
You have to work it out on collective.

00:33:55.825 --> 00:33:59.897
People who never even got Realization, nothing of the kind,

00:34:00.098 --> 00:34:04.100
have been doing so much organization and this and that.

00:34:04.301 --> 00:34:09.569
While you have got it, so now it is important that

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:15.770
you should now extend this light to others.
