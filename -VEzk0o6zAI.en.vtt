WEBVTT

00:00.297 --> 00:07.526
It’s a great pleasure that from all over the world

00:07.727 --> 00:14.750
people have gathered to worship Shiva.

00:14.951 --> 00:18.556
Actually we should say it is Sadashiva

00:18.757 --> 00:23.569
that we are going to worship today.

00:24.929 --> 00:34.221
As you know the difference between Sadashiva and Shri Shiva.

00:34.422 --> 00:44.590
Sadashiva is the God Almighty

00:44.791 --> 00:54.404
and He is a witness of the play of the Primordial Mother.

01:01.628 --> 01:04.099
The combination between

01:04.300 --> 01:09.919
Sadashiva and the Primordial Mother Adi Shakti

01:10.120 --> 01:15.060
is just like a moon and the moonlight

01:15.261 --> 01:18.263
or the sun or the sunlight.

01:18.464 --> 01:21.771
We cannot understand such relationship in human being,

01:21.972 --> 01:28.456
among human marriages or among human relationships.

01:33.564 --> 01:38.957
So whatever the Adi Shakti’s creating,

01:39.158 --> 01:44.113
which is the desire of Sadashiva,

01:44.314 --> 01:49.407
is being witnessed by Him.

01:50.017 --> 01:56.587
And when He is watching this creation

01:56.845 --> 02:05.804
He is witnessing all of it into all details.

02:06.547 --> 02:13.682
He witnesses the whole universe

02:13.883 --> 02:19.409
and He also witnesses this Mother Earth,

02:19.610 --> 02:26.883
all the creation that is done by the Adi Shakti.

02:27.561 --> 02:32.904
His power is of witnessing

02:33.105 --> 02:41.070
and the power of Adi Shakti

02:41.271 --> 02:46.888
is this all pervading power of love.

02:49.051 --> 02:57.328
So the God Almighty, the Father, the Primordial Father, we can say,

02:57.529 --> 03:02.837
expresses His desire, His Iccha Shakti

03:03.038 --> 03:12.164
as the Primordial Mother and She expresses Her power as love.

03:13.427 --> 03:24.766
So the relationship between the two is extremely understanding,

03:24.967 --> 03:28.063
very deep,

03:28.264 --> 03:32.758
and whatever She‘s creating,

03:32.959 --> 03:39.055
if She finds, if He finds there is some problem

03:39.256 --> 03:44.813
or there are people, human beings specially

03:45.014 --> 03:49.876
who are trying to obstruct Her work,

03:50.077 --> 03:56.970
or even the Gods who are not the deities

03:57.171 --> 04:02.173
are trying to express their egos,

04:02.374 --> 04:08.217
He is the one who brings forth their destruction.

04:09.804 --> 04:17.382
So He is the one who is responsible for the destructive power

04:18.116 --> 04:24.817
He is reflected in the hearts of human beings,

04:25.018 --> 04:30.512
among all the creations He pulsates.

04:30.713 --> 04:36.231
But that pulses, pulsation is the energy

04:36.432 --> 04:41.051
of the Primordial Mother.

04:41.252 --> 04:47.114
And He can destroy anything that goes against the plans

04:47.315 --> 04:50.347
of the Adi Shakti.

04:50.548 --> 04:58.227
Adi Shakti is love, She forgives and She loves.

04:58.428 --> 05:05.122
She loves her creation. She wants the creation to prosper,

05:05.323 --> 05:09.895
to go up to the same level for which it was created.

05:10.096 --> 05:17.810
She wants human beings to go to that level

05:18.011 --> 05:22.724
where they enter into the Kingdom of God,

05:22.925 --> 05:27.404
Kingdom of Sadashiva where there is bliss,

05:27.605 --> 05:32.792
there is forgiveness, there’s joy.

05:34.097 --> 05:42.350
All this is only possible if you have seeking,

05:42.551 --> 05:53.262
that you have also a innate desire to be there.

05:54.074 --> 05:59.076
This desire within us is reflected

05:59.277 --> 06:04.326
as the reflection of the Primordial Mother.

06:04.527 --> 06:07.389
Now this desire is there

06:07.590 --> 06:11.186
and other mundane desires are also there

06:11.387 --> 06:17.676
which stop the progress of your ascent.

06:18.942 --> 06:25.194
In Sahaja Yoga we have never tried

06:25.395 --> 06:29.046
to overcome the desires by taking sanyasa

06:29.247 --> 06:33.874
or running away from the house or for all kinds of things

06:34.075 --> 06:36.075
that has been suggested.

06:36.276 --> 06:40.263
The first thing that is done is that

06:40.464 --> 06:43.740
you get the light of your spirit.

06:43.941 --> 06:47.935
Spirit is the reflection of Sadashiva.

06:48.136 --> 06:51.958
In that light He shows, He is just showing the path.

06:52.159 --> 06:58.028
The spirit is just like a light which is burning

06:58.229 --> 07:01.926
and which is showing the path.

07:02.127 --> 07:08.114
In that path you yourself become so wise

07:08.315 --> 07:13.160
that you walk in the light of wisdom,

07:13.361 --> 07:17.160
that you walk in the light of righteousness.

07:17.361 --> 07:21.090
Because whatever is destructive is seen

07:21.291 --> 07:24.043
through the light of your spirit.

07:24.244 --> 07:29.113
You start giving up all that is destructive.

07:29.314 --> 07:33.238
Nobody has to tell you that give up this, give up that.

07:33.439 --> 07:39.246
You yourself realize that this is wrong and we should give up.

07:39.447 --> 07:47.884
This was, I should say, my own understanding of human beings

07:48.085 --> 07:51.618
because these are the days where people are

07:51.819 --> 07:55.766
in complete illusions.

07:55.967 --> 08:01.016
They are in a conflict all the time struggling even to exist.

08:01.217 --> 08:05.594
Under these circumstances, everything would have failed

08:05.795 --> 08:09.631
if you had started with taking a sanyasa

08:09.832 --> 08:12.561
and then going to Himalayas and all that.

08:12.762 --> 08:16.663
If you have to do this for the masses,

08:16.864 --> 08:19.632
something has to be done radical

08:19.833 --> 08:24.030
and luckily I’ve been able to find out a way

08:24.231 --> 08:33.418
by which you can get your sprouting, your Realization.

08:33.619 --> 08:36.707
Now some people who get Realization

08:36.908 --> 08:42.582
have to understand certain things because as you know

08:42.783 --> 08:46.746
there are many people who have got Realization.

08:46.947 --> 08:50.660
I don't know how many, I don't keep count.

08:50.861 --> 08:57.478
But what is lacking in them is surrendering.

08:59.718 --> 09:03.939
It’s embarrassing to say but is a fact.

09:04.140 --> 09:10.103
This is the only condition of modern Sahaja Yoga

09:10.304 --> 09:13.626
that you have to really surrender.

09:13.827 --> 09:16.345
If you start using your brain,

09:16.546 --> 09:21.579
if you start using other methods to understand Sahaja Yoga,

09:21.780 --> 09:26.024
you cannot. You must surrender

09:26.225 --> 09:29.947
and as Islam is nothing but surrender,

09:30.148 --> 09:33.236
Islam means surrender.

09:33.437 --> 09:39.658
And if that surrender is not there

09:39.859 --> 09:49.359
it is impossible to establish anyone in the Kingdom of God.

09:52.061 --> 09:59.417
Surrender is not that you should give up your family,

09:59.618 --> 10:05.433
give up your children, or give up your houses and homes

10:05.634 --> 10:10.003
and your properties. Surrendering is here:

10:10.204 --> 10:13.105
give up your ego to begin with

10:13.306 --> 10:16.722
and then give up your conditionings.

10:16.923 --> 10:20.925
For example, the other day I met one gentleman

10:21.126 --> 10:24.261
and he is suffering a lot.

10:24.462 --> 10:27.464
So I asked him, "Who is your Guru?",

10:27.665 --> 10:31.245
so he gave Me one name of a Guru.

10:31.446 --> 10:36.073
I said, "He’s not done any good to you,

10:36.274 --> 10:40.089
will you give him up?" He said, "Tomorrow."

10:40.290 --> 10:43.581
I said, "Why not today?" He said, "Today,

10:43.782 --> 10:46.604
but I have to throw away all his things.

10:46.805 --> 10:49.838
So tomorrow morning I will do it." I said, "All right, do it."

10:50.039 --> 10:53.377
"What should I throw away Mother?" I said,

10:53.578 --> 10:55.578
"Then all the things with which you worshipped him,

10:55.779 --> 10:59.601
throw away, throw away."

10:59.802 --> 11:01.802
Then he went around the whole house,

11:02.003 --> 11:06.380
found out whatever was there which was used

11:06.581 --> 11:10.521
for worshipping him, everything he gathered together,

11:10.722 --> 11:13.748
threw in the sea.

11:13.949 --> 11:18.334
And then he told the sea that, “I am sorry

11:18.535 --> 11:21.022
I have suffered a lot because of this man,

11:21.223 --> 11:24.881
now you please don't suffer.”

11:25.082 --> 11:29.764
So this kind of a very penetrating intelligence

11:29.965 --> 11:35.629
if you don't have you cannot give up.

11:36.464 --> 11:40.639
One sticks to that. I know of so many

11:40.840 --> 11:42.840
who find it so difficult to get rid of their conditionings.

11:43.832 --> 11:48.240
That’s more difficult than ego.

11:48.441 --> 11:52.131
Mundane conditionings and condition schemes that you have.

11:52.332 --> 11:56.846
We have first conditioning that supposing you are born

11:57.047 --> 12:01.018
in India or England or any place.

12:01.219 --> 12:04.299
After Sahaja Yoga I’ve seen most of the people

12:04.500 --> 12:07.885
they suddenly start seeing what’s wrong with their countrymen,

12:08.086 --> 12:11.268
what’s wrong with their country, what’s wrong with their religion,

12:11.469 --> 12:14.409
what’s wrong with the books they were reading.

12:14.610 --> 12:17.362
Immediately they start seeing it clearly,

12:17.563 --> 12:21.729
that this was the mistake, this is wrong.

12:21.930 --> 12:25.885
They all make fun of them. I’ve seen people all over the world.

12:26.086 --> 12:32.513
Nobody says that ‘No, no, no, no, because we are English

12:32.714 --> 12:35.435
we are the best, we are Russians so we are the best,

12:35.636 --> 12:37.755
or we are Indians we are the best’.

12:37.956 --> 12:40.747
Immediately they find out what’s wrong with them

12:40.948 --> 12:44.247
and why these people are not getting Realization.

12:44.448 --> 12:47.524
On the other hand they feel such compassion

12:47.725 --> 12:50.782
that ‘Mother so many people haven't got their Realization.

12:50.983 --> 12:54.696
Why shouldn't we try to give them Realization?’

12:54.897 --> 12:59.368
This is the double action of this light.

12:59.569 --> 13:03.087
Firstly you know that there is light

13:03.288 --> 13:06.173
and that you have become the light.

13:06.374 --> 13:11.782
So wherever your attention goes you start seeing reality

13:11.983 --> 13:16.235
and then you understand that this has been the conditioning

13:16.436 --> 13:20.915
of our country, of our society.

13:21.116 --> 13:24.829
And then they abhor all that is wrong,

13:25.030 --> 13:27.462
they never identify with it.

13:27.663 --> 13:31.993
But first thing as I said, is surrendering.

13:32.194 --> 13:36.846
In surrendering actually you develop

13:37.047 --> 13:42.299
a kind of a state where I would say

13:42.500 --> 13:49.960
you become a sanyasi, from within.

13:50.258 --> 13:53.280
That means nothing can dominate you,

13:53.481 --> 13:59.827
what is a sanyasi is a person who is above everything else.

14:00.028 --> 14:03.866
Nothing can stick to him.

14:04.067 --> 14:10.108
He just looks at things and he knows what it is.

14:10.309 --> 14:13.389
He may not say, he knows everything

14:13.590 --> 14:16.944
and he doesn't do whatever is wrong.

14:17.145 --> 14:22.327
He’s so detached, that in that detachment only he can see

14:22.528 --> 14:25.882
what’s wrong with him. He starts seeing his family people,

14:26.083 --> 14:28.765
he starts seeing other surroundings,

14:28.966 --> 14:33.382
everywhere he starts seeing what’s wrong.

14:33.591 --> 14:37.343
And he does not identify with them, is very surprising.

14:37.544 --> 14:41.507
I have seen it, I mean, I went to Turkey.

14:41.708 --> 14:44.624
In Turkey I met one gentleman who was running

14:44.825 --> 14:49.038
a big Swiss hotel and he came himself to Me

14:49.239 --> 14:52.541
and said Mother give me Realization. I was surprised

14:52.742 --> 14:56.948
because I didn't see this in Switzerland such a anxious personality

14:57.149 --> 15:00.425
would ask for Realization, very surprising that in Turkey

15:00.626 --> 15:04.917
he should ask for Realization. And I gave him Realization

15:05.118 --> 15:10.511
and immediately he said, "I am not going to go back to Switzerland.”

15:10.712 --> 15:15.267
Just imagine! It’s, you see, it is so clear-cut

15:15.468 --> 15:20.025
that this light definitely gives you tremendous wisdom

15:20.226 --> 15:22.470
and balance.

15:22.671 --> 15:27.142
Supposing you are walking and you can't see the road,

15:27.343 --> 15:31.244
you may fall down. But if there’s little light also you can see it.

15:31.445 --> 15:36.728
And this is what Sahaja Yoga has done, is given you very little light.

15:36.929 --> 15:40.447
That little light itself has been sufficient for you to give up

15:40.648 --> 15:47.093
so many things. Now the other side of it is the ego part.

15:47.570 --> 15:52.447
Ego is very subtle stuff with human beings.

15:52.648 --> 15:56.752
I don't know how they gather it, but they do

15:56.953 --> 16:00.600
and some of them have such a gullible ego

16:00.801 --> 16:04.514
that with the slightest thing it shoots off.

16:04.715 --> 16:08.084
And they get very angry for small things

16:08.285 --> 16:11.514
or if they find somebody whom they can dominate,

16:11.715 --> 16:14.725
they can dominate also that person.

16:14.926 --> 16:17.780
Now this ego when you start seeing it,

16:17.981 --> 16:20.952
you just start laughing at yourself

16:21.153 --> 16:24.366
and think that, what’s wrong with me.

16:24.567 --> 16:29.468
Ego is not like conditioning which is coming from outside

16:29.669 --> 16:32.320
but ego is something that comes from within.

16:32.521 --> 16:35.883
It can come from anything. Human beings

16:36.084 --> 16:39.422
have ego of all kinds of nonsensical things.

16:39.623 --> 16:43.531
One day I met one lady and she was very proud

16:43.732 --> 16:45.945
and was not even smiling.

16:46.146 --> 16:50.179
I said, "What’s the matter with this lady, what is she?"

16:50.380 --> 16:52.380
So they told Me, "She knows how to make dolls

16:52.581 --> 16:55.083
that’s why she’s so proud.” I said,

16:55.284 --> 16:58.060
“Eh, to make dolls, she’s so proud!”

16:58.261 --> 17:02.685
"Yes, you know, she can make dolls, so she’s so proud."

17:02.886 --> 17:05.849
I said, "What is there, anybody can make dolls,

17:06.050 --> 17:09.005
so what is so great?" "No, but she thinks she is very great

17:09.206 --> 17:10.698
because she makes dolls."

17:10.899 --> 17:14.620
So a man becomes stupid and stupid.

17:14.821 --> 17:18.253
That is first sign of a egoistical person.

17:18.454 --> 17:21.639
He is so stupid that when you are talking to him,

17:21.840 --> 17:25.241
you just get flabbergasted that without paying anything

17:25.442 --> 17:29.233
you have got a buffoon before you who is showing all joke,

17:29.434 --> 17:33.233
jokes of his buffoonery.

17:33.434 --> 17:37.881
Is something very surprising, I mean, you meet any egoistical person

17:38.082 --> 17:43.592
and you just watch him: “I did this, I am, I, I, I ...”

17:43.793 --> 17:46.325
Then you start seeing the person, what’s the matter,

17:46.526 --> 17:51.458
he’s not even ashamed to say things that should not be said.

17:51.659 --> 17:55.692
Then it goes even to the sinful life they lead.

17:55.893 --> 17:58.708
They lead a very sinful life, they fond of women,

17:58.909 --> 18:01.810
they drink and this and that.

18:02.011 --> 18:04.482
Then they start boasting about that also:

18:04.683 --> 18:08.912
“I drank that day so much; I had five women around me.”

18:09.113 --> 18:13.389
They start boasting of that also. So, for a egoistical man

18:13.590 --> 18:17.020
there is nothing like shame. He’ll go on telling about

18:17.221 --> 18:19.715
his nonsensical things and everybody will say

18:19.916 --> 18:22.504
‘My God with whom are we talking?’

18:22.705 --> 18:28.701
And then, whatever they do they justify. I asked one fellow,

18:28.902 --> 18:32.209
"You had such a bad heart attack why do you drink now,

18:32.410 --> 18:36.178
give up drinking." He said, "But even this person Kirloskar” -

18:36.379 --> 18:41.311
we have one in Poona who is now, I think, 95 – “he drinks”.

18:41.512 --> 18:45.155
So I said, "You are not Kirloskar, and even if he drinks,

18:45.356 --> 18:48.249
what’s the use, what is he gaining by that?"

18:48.450 --> 18:52.569
"No, no, you see he’s very good, because, see, he drinks

18:52.770 --> 18:54.770
and he’s so successful."

18:54.971 --> 18:58.583
"Is he successful without, because of drinking?"

18:58.784 --> 19:04.224
But even ordinary reasoning is not there, ordinary reasoning.

19:04.425 --> 19:09.099
And in the general way if you see, even if you see

19:09.300 --> 19:12.395
the greatest drunkard countries, I have never seen

19:12.596 --> 19:17.418
a statue of a man who died of drinking, never.

19:17.619 --> 19:20.580
I’ve not seen in any country people are praising a man

19:20.781 --> 19:27.018
because he had ten women or he died of drinking. So far!

19:27.219 --> 19:31.284
I don't know how far human beings can go in their ego.

19:31.485 --> 19:34.979
Now this ego is spreading very much in modern times

19:35.180 --> 19:42.680
where they start saying, "I like this, I don't like this".

19:43.676 --> 19:47.526
“What, what you don't like?” "I don't like this kind of a sari,

19:47.727 --> 19:50.807
I don't like this kind of clothes, I don't like this."

19:51.008 --> 19:54.799
But who are you, you are not going to see yourself, others are going to see.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.877
So what difference does it make whether you like it or not?

19:58.078 --> 20:03.299
But is very common with young people, to talk like that "I like."

20:03.500 --> 20:07.760
And this is a sign of complete destruction.

20:07.961 --> 20:13.658
Because ego is not only, is, makes you stupid,

20:13.859 --> 20:16.447
you see all these days the way people dress up

20:16.648 --> 20:21.775
and we find they are very stupid because "I like it, so what?”

20:21.976 --> 20:24.611
Anything they like it, you know, if they want to walk on

20:24.812 --> 20:29.533
their heads "I like it, what’s wrong?”

20:29.734 --> 20:34.642
All kinds of stupidity can be explained through ego.

20:34.843 --> 20:38.822
So those who get Realization somehow or other,

20:39.023 --> 20:42.088
thank God, see it:

20:42.289 --> 20:46.377
This is my ego talking.

20:46.578 --> 20:49.916
Then they start laughing at themselves,

20:50.117 --> 20:55.760
making fun of themselves: This was my ego.

20:55.961 --> 20:59.158
But also in Sahaja Yoga there are people,

20:59.359 --> 21:01.359
I said, "Why don't you go and organize?"

21:01.560 --> 21:05.609
"Mother because my ego will come up." I said, "What’s this?”

21:05.810 --> 21:09.562
“My ego will come up so I don’t want to organize."

21:09.763 --> 21:13.046
How can your ego come up? If you see your ego,

21:13.247 --> 21:19.351
supposing you see, something is burning, you see it there.

21:19.552 --> 21:22.398
How can you get that burning onto yourself?

21:22.599 --> 21:29.734
But this is a very subtle type of, avoiding work of Sahaja Yoga

21:29.935 --> 21:32.586
to say that "No, I’ll get into ego." I said,

21:32.787 --> 21:38.109
"All right you get into ego, I’ll see to it, get in, what happens."

21:38.310 --> 21:42.781
So all kinds of things there are which makes a person

21:42.982 --> 21:47.911
quite idiotic and stupid.

21:48.490 --> 21:54.227
I mean, I don't know how many things I can tell you today.

21:54.428 --> 21:59.430
But also I’ve seen in marriages this is very common.

21:59.631 --> 22:04.602
They’ll say that, ‘Mother, I married this girl at that time

22:04.803 --> 22:08.633
but now I don't think I should have been married.’

22:08.834 --> 22:11.797
Bah, bah, what, that time, what had happened to you,

22:12.014 --> 22:14.179
why didn't you marry at that time?

22:14.380 --> 22:17.261
I have to tell you these things because I’ve been facing

22:17.462 --> 22:22.727
all kinds of problems of this stupid, idiotic ego.

22:23.329 --> 22:30.105
One has to see it clearly, how this ego is working in me

22:30.306 --> 22:35.535
and how it is keeping me down. So when we talk of ascent,

22:35.736 --> 22:41.473
we talk of a higher life. We have to become sanyasi

22:41.674 --> 22:45.387
like the lotus that comes out of the pond

22:45.588 --> 22:50.173
and no water can stay on them.

22:50.580 --> 22:54.496
Even the leaves of lotus, no water can stay on them.

22:54.697 --> 22:56.697
Just like that we have to become.

22:56.898 --> 23:00.939
We don't have to wear sanyasis dresses, nothing of that.

23:01.140 --> 23:07.822
But from inside, a kind of a detached attention is there

23:08.023 --> 23:15.543
which immediately locates the problem, within you and without.

23:15.744 --> 23:21.655
And also in Sahaja Yoga, you know how to overcome that.

23:21.856 --> 23:31.078
It’s a very effective, efficient system.

23:31.279 --> 23:35.087
But for that again, to achieve that

23:35.288 --> 23:41.048
you have to become Shiva within, means detached.

23:41.249 --> 23:46.321
As Shiva is completely detached, you have to be detached.

23:46.522 --> 23:52.891
And that detachment will give you the same wisdom as Shiva has.

23:53.092 --> 23:57.719
Shiva sees, we should say, Sadashiva sees

23:57.920 --> 24:03.203
the work of Adi Shakti, silently. He doesn't get proud,

24:03.404 --> 24:06.625
he doesn't develop a kind of a ego

24:06.826 --> 24:11.953
‘Let me see now what my Iccha Shakti is doing’, nothing,

24:12.154 --> 24:14.711
he’s just watching.

24:14.912 --> 24:19.367
But when it comes to destruction,

24:19.568 --> 24:24.156
he sees that this part is going to destroy the work,

24:24.357 --> 24:29.445
immediately he destroys, removes that portion.

24:29.646 --> 24:32.351
In the same way we have to be,

24:32.552 --> 24:38.523
we have to see our life itself is a big field.

24:38.724 --> 24:44.765
How do we consider ourselves to be?

24:44.966 --> 24:48.421
I have seen people talk, "Oh, so what, I am a Sahaja Yogi!"

24:48.622 --> 24:53.465
You can't talk like that if you are a Sahaja Yogi.

24:54.989 --> 25:00.186
With folded hands you have to say, “I am a Sahaja Yogi”.

25:00.387 --> 25:05.827
In your behavior, in your talk, in everything,

25:06.028 --> 25:13.238
you have to be a person who is extremely humble.

25:16.011 --> 25:23.675
If that is not so that means Sahaja Yoga has given you double ego.

25:24.721 --> 25:30.043
As it is you know that Shiva is known for his innocence,

25:30.244 --> 25:35.074
for his simplicity, his forgiveness. He forgives.

25:35.275 --> 25:38.543
He forgives rakshasas; he’ll forgive everyone

25:38.744 --> 25:40.744
that is his quality.

25:40.945 --> 25:46.347
But anybody who goes against the Primordial Mother,

25:46.548 --> 25:50.035
he doesn't spare.

25:50.236 --> 25:54.144
So this is his, the quality one has to understand,

25:54.345 --> 25:57.988
surrendering doesn't mean outside things to be surrendered.

25:58.189 --> 26:03.715
What is there, these are all stones, what are you surrendering?

26:03.916 --> 26:08.793
Surrendering means cleansing yourself completely,

26:08.994 --> 26:12.231
getting completely detached.

26:12.432 --> 26:18.189
Detachment is the only way you can rise.

26:31.230 --> 26:34.458
Some people get sick, they make such an ado out of it:

26:34.659 --> 26:40.028
“I am sick, the whole world should know I am sick, sick, sick, sick, sick.”

26:40.229 --> 26:44.623
But if you are a Sahaja Yogi, if you just watch,

26:44.824 --> 26:49.131
how so, I am sick, all right, let’s see.

26:49.332 --> 26:51.873
Just like a sport.

26:52.074 --> 26:54.881
Just watch.

26:55.082 --> 26:58.014
I am sick. So, what’s happening now?

26:58.215 --> 27:01.780
The temperature is coming nicely, now is going down,

27:01.989 --> 27:10.983
you just sort of a playful, mirthful attention.

27:11.702 --> 27:14.798
Ah, when I came I had temperature,

27:14.999 --> 27:17.540
but nobody believes I had temperature.

27:17.741 --> 27:20.493
I was so tired in the marriage they said, "You don’t look tired."

27:20.694 --> 27:23.556
I said, "All right, I’m not tired."

27:23.757 --> 27:28.306
In the same way, life also is to be played.

27:28.507 --> 27:32.931
It’s just a play, and that play has to be seen

27:33.132 --> 27:37.767
through the light of wisdom.

27:37.968 --> 27:43.150
Nothing is so serious, for Sahaja Yogis nothing is so serious.

27:43.351 --> 27:45.642
But he becomes very serious

27:45.843 --> 27:52.139
and he makes too much ado about himself.

27:52.687 --> 27:57.603
There are lots of things which we have to learn.

27:57.804 --> 28:00.759
When we worship Shiva, we praise him.

28:00.960 --> 28:03.353
You are this you are that, you are that.

28:03.554 --> 28:06.548
When you worship Me also you praise Me, you are this.

28:06.749 --> 28:08.855
I am not aware of all that that you say.

28:09.056 --> 28:11.894
But you say all right, if you say so, it’s all right.

28:12.095 --> 28:15.128
You are this you are that, the thousand names of Shiva,

28:15.329 --> 28:19.370
thousand name of the Goddess, thousand name of Vishnu.

28:19.571 --> 28:22.370
These are their names you are worshipping,

28:22.571 --> 28:25.706
what about you people,

28:25.907 --> 28:29.104
how many names you can have?

28:29.305 --> 28:34.971
Actually in the puja when you take the names of these Shaktis

28:35.172 --> 28:39.807
they also get awakened within, no doubt.

28:40.008 --> 28:46.687
After Puja you do feel that way but you don't utilize them.

28:47.305 --> 28:50.932
So many people I’ve seen have come in the Puja

28:51.133 --> 28:56.510
and they have got that power within themselves,

28:56.711 --> 28:59.198
same powers.

28:59.399 --> 29:04.409
But by the time they are out, it’s finished, it’s gone.

29:04.610 --> 29:12.227
So, surrendering has another side: assumption.

29:14.286 --> 29:19.374
Assumption that I am a Sahaja Yogi

29:19.575 --> 29:25.944
and I can absorb all these powers within myself.

29:26.145 --> 29:30.014
So one side is surrendering.

29:30.215 --> 29:34.795
Why to surrender? To absorb.

29:34.996 --> 29:41.014
Automatically when you are surrendered you absorb.

29:41.215 --> 29:44.069
But once you have absorbed,

29:44.270 --> 29:49.148
then you should retain and assume within yourself,

29:49.349 --> 29:53.836
know that you have these powers.

29:54.037 --> 29:59.813
There, where Sahaja Yogis fail more. First time it happened,

30:00.014 --> 30:04.102
no Sahaja Yogi would touch anybody raise anybody's Kundalini,

30:04.303 --> 30:08.610
this thing, that thing. We had at least fifty Sahaja Yogis by then.

30:08.811 --> 30:11.548
I said, "Now what to do, I have prepared these channels

30:11.749 --> 30:14.212
and nobody is even raising their fingers.

30:14.413 --> 30:18.790
How am I going to work it out?" Very difficult!

30:18.991 --> 30:23.017
But once it happened we had a program in Nasik Road

30:23.218 --> 30:25.218
and I was staying in Nasik.

30:25.419 --> 30:29.234
It’s about, I think, thirty miles from there.

30:29.435 --> 30:34.117
So, we reached halfway and our car failed

30:34.318 --> 30:40.953
and nobody no other car was coming, nothing, no support, nothing.

30:41.154 --> 30:43.549
I didn't know what to do.

30:43.750 --> 30:47.338
But these, all the Sahaja Yogis had arrived there,

30:47.539 --> 30:51.111
and such a big crowd. They started saying, "When is Mataji coming?

30:51.312 --> 30:55.197
When is Mataji coming?" Such a pressure!

30:55.398 --> 30:58.463
So they said, "It’s all right, we’ll give you Realization, sit down."

30:58.664 --> 31:01.268
And they gave Realization.

31:01.469 --> 31:04.633
That’s the first time the Sahaja Yogis started knowing that

31:04.834 --> 31:09.485
they can give Realization, they can do this, they can do that.

31:09.686 --> 31:14.282
They all started after that.

31:14.483 --> 31:19.805
So assumption should be there, that I have these powers,

31:20.006 --> 31:23.610
I am not going to waste them, I am going to use them,

31:23.811 --> 31:28.563
I am going to look after others, I am not going to just keep to myself.

31:28.764 --> 31:31.586
This assumption has to come.

31:31.787 --> 31:34.227
Once I was traveling by ship

31:34.428 --> 31:37.571
and one fellow got caught up in the freeze room

31:37.772 --> 31:41.798
and he got pneumonia. So the captain came to Me

31:41.999 --> 31:44.217
‘That see this boy has got pneumonia,

31:44.418 --> 31:47.466
we have to get some doctor by helicopter.’ I said,

31:47.667 --> 31:50.435
"Captain, I’ve given you Realization, you are a doctor."

31:50.636 --> 31:54.154
He said "Who, I?” “Yes, you." "If you want, I can go down."

31:54.355 --> 31:57.099
"No, no, no, but tell me what to be done." I said "Just go

31:57.300 --> 32:00.904
and put your hand on his heart, finished."

32:01.105 --> 32:06.693
"I" he said. "Yes, you!" Went down and put his hand

32:06.894 --> 32:09.818
and the fellow got all right.

32:10.019 --> 32:13.310
He was amazed.

32:13.511 --> 32:18.060
He met Me now in the wedding – and he was amazed at himself.

32:18.261 --> 32:22.638
"This I can do to anyone?" "Yes, yes, you can!”

32:22.839 --> 32:26.324
But if you do not assume, and just sit down meditating,

32:26.525 --> 32:32.314
meditating, surrendering … what’s the use?

32:34.434 --> 32:38.916
So, you have to do,

32:39.117 --> 32:42.618
now after achieving Shiva state

32:42.819 --> 32:48.311
you have to start doing the work of Adi Shakti.

32:49.163 --> 32:54.798
You should get this desire that we should spread Sahaja Yoga,

32:54.999 --> 32:56.999
we have to work it out.

32:57.200 --> 33:00.257
But be careful sometimes you might be conditioned,

33:00.458 --> 33:03.351
you might be egotistical, watch yourself.

33:03.552 --> 33:08.046
With watching you can, I’m sure, you can achieve a lot.

33:08.247 --> 33:12.194
We have done, some people who have taken it upon themselves

33:12.395 --> 33:16.421
have done it, everywhere, in every country.

33:16.622 --> 33:21.741
So the first thing of surrendering is important

33:21.942 --> 33:26.952
to reach the state of your Spirit, of Shiva and Sadashiva.

33:27.153 --> 33:34.577
But the second state is that you have to now think of others.

33:35.418 --> 33:39.757
First it is as they say in Sanskrit is vyashti,

33:39.958 --> 33:44.366
means individual gain, you get the individual gain.

33:44.567 --> 33:51.186
And then it becomes samashti, means the collective.

33:51.387 --> 33:55.624
You have to work it out on collective.

33:55.825 --> 33:59.897
People who never even got Realization, nothing of the kind,

34:00.098 --> 34:04.100
have been doing so much organization and this and that.

34:04.301 --> 34:09.569
While you have got it, so now it is important that

34:09.770 --> 34:15.770
you should now extend this light to others.
