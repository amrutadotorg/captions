00:00:04.913 --> 00:00:10.429
PRACTICAL ADVICE

00:00:17.504 --> 00:00:21.879
Now, I think I have already given you

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.434
a very, very long lecture and a speech
as you call it,

00:00:26.635 --> 00:00:36.539
but some reactions were very good, and some
could absorb it very well.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:43.967
But some, they said, were sleeping. Now
these things happen because of negativity.

00:00:44.175 --> 00:00:50.795
You have to fight your negativity, because
negativity is the thing that asks questions.

00:00:50.996 --> 00:00:55.007
When I am talking I am telling the truth,
absolute truth,

00:00:55.208 --> 00:00:57.641
but it asks questions and it reflects.

00:00:57.842 --> 00:01:01.627
When it starts reflecting, nothing goes
in the head because you are left

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:06.088
with the past sentence, and the present
you are not with it.

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:12.428
So the whole thing boils down to something

00:01:12.629 --> 00:01:16.605
like an escape, and then you escape and
you sleep off.

00:01:16.806 --> 00:01:20.938
I mean, I tried My level best today to put
you onto your conscious mind.

00:01:21.115 --> 00:01:25.101
You have to be conscious, you have to be
alert;

00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:30.602
and that’s the point, is that unless and
until you are conscious you cannot ascend.

00:01:30.803 --> 00:01:38.176
Any abnormal person cannot ascend. You have
to normalize yourself.

00:01:38.377 --> 00:01:41.342
So many of you had lots of abnormalities

00:01:41.543 --> 00:01:47.552
which were brought out and thrown away,
and many have been cleansed,

00:01:47.753 --> 00:01:53.170
but now if there are some still lingering
with it, they must work it out.

00:01:53.371 --> 00:01:57.527
They cannot just go on justifying it.

00:01:58.227 --> 00:02:02.708
Normally negative persons attract
a negative personality.

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.372
So if you have such a negativity of any 
kind within you, you should never sit

00:02:06.573 --> 00:02:09.194
next to a negative person, never go near
such a person.

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:12.763
Keep away, but stick on to the positive
person.

00:02:13.247 --> 00:02:15.843
So the reaction of some people was very
good,

00:02:16.044 --> 00:02:19.429
they absorbed what I said, they took
everything inside;

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.801
but some of them went off to sleep.

00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:26.395
Now, if those who were struggling at that
time may not have understood –

00:02:26.596 --> 00:02:30.431
it’s a difficult subject, I told you, it’s
a very subtle subject, doesn’t matter.

00:02:30.632 --> 00:02:39.095
But those who have been like that should
look after themselves, should find out.

00:02:39.296 --> 00:02:41.456
I’ve found out one thing with the left-
sided people:

00:02:41.657 --> 00:02:47.009
if they can put a candle near their left
Swadisthana, a little far away,

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.608
and put one candle before the photograph,
and put left hand

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:56.043
towards the photograph and right hand
on the Mother Earth, it works.

00:02:57.064 --> 00:02:59.668
And the candle at the back should be kept
a little far away

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:04.155
because it makes sounds, it goes this way,
that way, burns.

00:03:04.356 --> 00:03:09.562
Those who have been taking drugs, not LSD
but other drugs, which are drowsy people

00:03:09.763 --> 00:03:13.552
who feel sleepy, whose brains are destroyed
by drug,

00:03:13.753 --> 00:03:20.376
all those people can benefit a lot by this.
Do it every day.

00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:26.034
Going into drug you never felt you’re
surrendered to drugs,

00:03:26.196 --> 00:03:32.727
never felt that way – which was something
that was going to kill you completely.

00:03:32.928 --> 00:03:37.085
You know how so many people are killed, so
many are dying, but you wanted to do that,

00:03:37.286 --> 00:03:40.053
I don’t know, because your ego said,
“All right, go ahead, try this.

00:03:40.254 --> 00:03:45.038
You will be the one who nothing will happen
to you.” That’s the ego suggests.

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.115
So you did it. All right, doesn’t matter.

00:03:48.308 --> 00:03:54.159
Whatever has happened has happened, let us
clear it out, because we are seekers.

00:03:58.172 --> 00:04:06.958
So those who have really felt one
in the lecture, without any questioning,

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:09.700
should know that they are doing well.

00:04:09.901 --> 00:04:14.609
Those who were questioning, reflecting,
should know they have ego,

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.201
and those who were dozing out should know
that they are left-sided.

00:04:21.104 --> 00:04:25.585
Left side is worse than the right side,
because the right side can be

00:04:25.786 --> 00:04:29.901
easily corrected: it shows, it shows
outside.

00:04:30.102 --> 00:04:32.649
People don’t like it. Such a person is
criticized,

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.357
everybody says he’s egoistical, he’s this,
that.

00:04:35.558 --> 00:04:39.155
Everybody knows that such a person goes out
like Hitler.

00:04:39.356 --> 00:04:43.016
But the left-sided person, you see, is very
pitiable

00:04:43.217 --> 00:04:46.000
and you’ll have very great pity for such
a person and you sympathize,

00:04:46.201 --> 00:04:48.395
and you get lost with that person.

00:04:48.596 --> 00:04:53.939
They are more dangerous, and difficult
to be cured, very difficult.

00:04:56.085 --> 00:04:59.134
So it’s not a easy task, we have to work
it out.

00:04:59.335 --> 00:05:04.133
I am trying My level best. You should also
help Me.

00:05:04.865 --> 00:05:09.232
I was thinking that if you can start using
a little oil for your head

00:05:09.433 --> 00:05:12.920
will be a good idea, in the night.
As Sahaja yogis you should.

00:05:13.121 --> 00:05:15.114
I think the hairstyle should be changed
for Sahaja yogis.

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:18.081
This modern fashionable style won’t suit
us.

00:05:18.282 --> 00:05:20.833
Because this will, we’ll have all bald
heads one day,

00:05:21.034 --> 00:05:25.998
I can tell you, and you will see 
the Sahasrara with a big dimple here.

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:30.990
Better use some nice coconut oil, rub in
your head nicely,

00:05:31.167 --> 00:05:36.624
and in the night and in the morning –
after all, it doesn’t show much –

00:05:36.825 --> 00:05:39.016
and comb your hair in a proper way.

00:05:39.217 --> 00:05:41.913
Because also I think, if your dresses are
like bhoots,

00:05:42.114 --> 00:05:44.720
your hair are like bhoots then the bhoots
will take over

00:05:44.921 --> 00:05:48.597
thinking, “Oh, this is a bhoot sitting down
here, I better take hold of that bhoot.”

00:05:48.798 --> 00:05:52.363
So dress up in a way – shouldn’t have hair
on your forehead at all,

00:05:52.564 --> 00:05:58.213
keep it straight, make it nice, and have it
absolutely clean foreheads.

00:05:58.414 --> 00:06:00.260
We are Sahaja yogis: we have to change
our dresses,

00:06:00.461 --> 00:06:06.508
we have to change our styles, we cannot
become fashionable like these stupid punks.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:16.106
So we are a type, by our hairstyle people
should know that these are Sahaja yogis.

00:06:16.307 --> 00:06:20.817
So before you start getting bald, better
try putting some oil in your head.

00:06:21.018 --> 00:06:23.808
That’s one very important thing the Sahaja
yogis have to do.

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:29.256
They can take vibrated oil if you like and
I think, olive oil is good,

00:06:29.457 --> 00:06:34.872
but better than olive oil, I find, it is
coconut oil

00:06:35.073 --> 00:06:39.690
is better for the growth of the hair. But
sometimes you can also put almond oil,

00:06:39.891 --> 00:06:44.589
is also good, almond oil for you; because
if you have any problem

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:50.728
that you feel exhausted or your nerves need
attention,

00:06:50.929 --> 00:06:55.123
you are nervous type of person, then almond
oil is good for you.

00:06:55.324 --> 00:07:02.013
And for people who have teeth which are
troubling them, they must look after them.

00:07:02.214 --> 00:07:04.956
No use going to the dentist, because
dentists create problems.

00:07:05.157 --> 00:07:08.696
Simple thing is to use olive oil and some
salt,

00:07:08.897 --> 00:07:15.428
and rub it on your gums nicely every day
before sleeping.

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:18.919
That will keep your teeth all right.
You’ll be amazed,

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.893
till today I have not been to any dentist.
Never been to a dentist,

00:07:23.094 --> 00:07:26.958
and I hope I won’t go to the dentist.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:32.452
So, but one thing is that I have certain
"bad" habits,

00:07:32.653 --> 00:07:36.308
one of them is that I brush my teeth quite
often.

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:38.704
But don’t use electrical brushes and 
all that,

00:07:38.905 --> 00:07:41.864
but use brushes or use your fingers,

00:07:42.065 --> 00:07:49.181
is the best way is to rub with the salt and
the oil, it’s very good for you.

00:07:49.382 --> 00:07:52.936
And then allow the whole thing to come out,
and then wash off.

00:07:53.137 --> 00:07:56.911
Then the third thing I find in Europe,

00:07:57.112 --> 00:08:02.121
that you people do not clear your throats,
and your tongues,

00:08:02.322 --> 00:08:04.769
which is another thing very much against
Vishuddhi.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:08.537
And that must be one of the reasons why
your Vishuddhis are bad.

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:13.242
So, though it is not in fashionable here
in the West,

00:08:13.443 --> 00:08:18.679
but very important thing is to put your two
fingers in the mouth and rub your –

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.752
fingers, not the thing, fingers –

00:08:21.953 --> 00:08:26.351
and clean your tongue in such a way that
everything comes out in the morning.

00:08:26.552 --> 00:08:30.986
Is important, because that accumulates and
then it rots.

00:08:31.194 --> 00:08:34.719
So this has to be done. And may be that you
might think that this is doing,

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:40.476
you make a noise and all that, doesn’t
matter. You have to clear out your throat;

00:08:40.677 --> 00:08:43.251
I mean, that’s how you will keep your
Vishuddhis very clear.

00:08:43.452 --> 00:08:48.215
This is one of the things. And another
thing is that you must always use water

00:08:48.416 --> 00:08:51.919
as much as possible, for washing:

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.260
when you go for your morning ablution,
water must be used.

00:08:55.461 --> 00:09:00.929
The paper is a very dirty and unhygienic
habit, very dirty and unhygienic habit.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:07.178
But even if you use paper, you must use
water after that. It’s very important

00:09:07.379 --> 00:09:11.362
that all the time the water should be used
as much as possible;

00:09:11.563 --> 00:09:15.963
for Sahaja yogis it is a very, very
important thing.
