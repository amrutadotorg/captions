00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:07.761
Gopal, saying, please take me across this ocean of illusion,

00:00:07.786 --> 00:00:13.106
this Bhavasagara, is requesting Shri Krishna,

00:00:13.186 --> 00:00:19.055
Panduranga is Shri Krishna in Maharashtra is called as Panduranga and Vitthala.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.075
Also there is a big story about it,

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.081
but I'll tell you later on.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:28.280
So, he says, he's requesting, please take me across

00:00:28.305 --> 00:00:31.670
and this is what I wanted.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.822
But the way he sang it, with such

00:00:34.847 --> 00:00:38.901
devotion, sincerity and honesty,

00:00:38.926 --> 00:00:42.780
it's really, it has stirred up all the vibrations, I know,

00:00:42.805 --> 00:00:45.320
and you are feeling all that.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.195
You see, we Maharashtrians are very lucky people,

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.330
that we had such saints who were realized
souls.

00:00:52.355 --> 00:00:57.535
They knew about chaitanya, they knew about vibrations,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.582
they knew about the higher life

00:01:00.607 --> 00:01:08.084
and all the time, whatever they have sung is

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:12.976
the hope that everybody will get realization.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.157
Or they have described that state of realization.

00:01:18.414 --> 00:01:21.240
I mean, I must say the Maharashtrians are the luckiest people,

00:01:21.265 --> 00:01:23.830
I don't know if they understand it or not,

00:01:23.855 --> 00:01:29.090
but they are the most blessed people because there are so many saints

00:01:29.115 --> 00:01:32.022
who were realized souls, they had Nathas

00:01:32.047 --> 00:01:35.569
who were realized souls and all of them have sung

00:01:35.594 --> 00:01:40.127
the song and the praise of this higher state of life.

00:01:40.152 --> 00:01:43.203
And this one you can see now, this song also says

00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:47.716
the same thing, that let me go beyond this.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.063
But I must say one thing,

00:01:50.088 --> 00:01:53.303
congratulating all these Sahaja Yogis from the West,

00:01:53.328 --> 00:01:56.295
that they never had heard about these things, never.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.495
They never knew about these things.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.115
They never knew there's another world so beautiful as that.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.130
But the way they have accepted it,

00:02:04.155 --> 00:02:07.392
the way they have got into it and the way they are enjoying

00:02:07.417 --> 00:02:10.683
this divine music is very remarkable.

00:02:10.708 --> 00:02:14.135
They have never studied any Indian music at all.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.154
They have never heard any Indian music before.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.648
But the way they enjoy, it is because of Chaitanya Yogi,

00:02:21.673 --> 00:02:28.218
because Indian music has been coming from Aum.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.515
And that's why because you are spirits, you can enjoy it.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.375
You see, only an atma can appreciate this song of atma.

00:02:40.614 --> 00:02:43.575
And that's why without understanding the language,

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.467
without understanding the meaning, without understanding the music

00:02:47.492 --> 00:02:51.135
and the intricacies of that, just enjoying it.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.455
That's what we have to do, is to enjoy.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.703
After all, why to have the words, why to have anything, just to enjoy.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.447
And this is what we have to thank

00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:05.884
Ajit for this thing, a great thing that he's done,

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.992
is to, he himself has got his realization, he sings with that

00:03:10.017 --> 00:03:14.216
oneness and when he sings you see, you get vibrations.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.723
He is the only singer I have seen so far,

00:03:17.748 --> 00:03:19.440
who has been that good

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:25.120
and who has been able to keep you united with the Chaitanya.

00:04:51.543 --> 00:04:57.212
So we have to thank him very much for this beautiful music,

00:04:57.237 --> 00:04:59.277
which has touched all your heart.

00:04:59.302 --> 00:05:01.259
And now in this song also,

00:05:01.291 --> 00:05:04.402
he is saying, Oh God, please make your heart large

00:05:04.433 --> 00:05:06.622
and give me realization.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.785
So, you see, God always has a very large heart.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.710
Only thing, you have to ask for realization.

00:05:15.735 --> 00:05:17.752
It cannot be forced.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.315
So now the culmination of our spiritual life has come.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.955
All the saints have a meaning.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.155
All the shastras have meaning.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.195
Every incarnation has a meaning today.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.968
Tomorrow we are going to do worship of Shri Ganesha.

00:05:34.993 --> 00:05:37.209
You know how important He is.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.115
And He has come here and He will also attend tomorrow's puja.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.795
And everybody will help us there.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.975
I am sure you will all enjoy it.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.970
May God bless you.
