00:10.302 --> 00:14.372
It is such a great day today

00:17.556 --> 00:23.539
that the French got their liberation on this day.

00:24.377 --> 00:28.742
But what is this liberation for? - I don't know.

00:30.717 --> 00:35.379
In no country where they had freedom and liberation,

00:35.837 --> 00:43.363
I have seen, it has not worked something very much that was expected.

00:47.035 --> 00:50.397
Same in France...

00:53.425 --> 00:56.361
So the liberation through anger,

00:58.783 --> 01:00.783
when it comes,

01:01.552 --> 01:03.552
hatred

01:07.476 --> 01:14.970
is the basis of these revolutions and these

01:15.647 --> 01:18.748
so called achieved liberations.

01:22.245 --> 01:29.484
If the liberation takes place within yourself,

01:32.964 --> 01:36.730
so that you are no more slave of anyone of these

01:39.112 --> 01:43.551
horrible destructive forces and negative forces,

01:44.638 --> 01:47.234
then it's a real liberation.

01:49.415 --> 01:54.789
The second thing that has happened in France, first time in Europe,

01:56.290 --> 02:00.270
it has been recognized as dharma.

02:00.471 --> 02:04.121
It's a very big thing, and
give a hand to it.

02:17.216 --> 02:22.398
It is recognized that Sahaja Yoga is dharma.

02:22.598 --> 02:28.420
It is. But today it was recognized.

02:29.048 --> 02:31.616
This is a very big thing.

02:34.593 --> 02:37.398
I must say credit goes to your leader

02:37.555 --> 02:41.945
and to all the Sahaja yogis of France

02:42.247 --> 02:47.945
who have worked so hard to get this sanction, this

02:48.145 --> 02:52.582
kind of a position.

02:53.933 --> 02:58.057
It's a very great thing.

03:00.443 --> 03:07.443
So, today I was thinking that we'll have the puja of Shri Vishnu,

03:08.347 --> 03:11.942
who was the basis of dharma.

03:14.572 --> 03:19.113
So far we have never worshipped anyone

03:23.202 --> 03:27.223
who were the basics,

03:29.720 --> 03:32.307
except for Shiva.

03:33.961 --> 03:40.110
We only worshipped the incarnations because they became as incarnation;

03:40.099 --> 03:42.549
Ganesha came as incarnation,

03:42.745 --> 03:45.256
the Goddess came as incarnations,

03:45.456 --> 03:52.243
Rama, Shri Krishna, Gurus, Christ, Buddha,

03:53.212 --> 03:57.287
all of them came as incarnations on this earth.

03:57.872 --> 04:02.258
And we worshipped the incarnations who came on earth

04:03.029 --> 04:10.205
specially. But today, as Sahaja Yoga is established as dharma,

04:10.405 --> 04:12.871
we have to know about Shri Vishnu

04:13.071 --> 04:16.695
who is the basis of dharma.

04:20.969 --> 04:28.891
Later on He came on this earth as Shri Ram, then as Shri Krishna,

04:29.627 --> 04:33.837
and ultimately as Kalki.

04:39.581 --> 04:43.459
It is a beautiful evolution

04:45.233 --> 04:48.397
of Shri Vishnu.

04:50.283 --> 04:53.038
So, one has to understand

04:53.238 --> 04:58.023
what is the basis of dharma.

05:01.484 --> 05:05.043
If you know, in the matter they are eight valencies.

05:07.222 --> 05:10.496
They are negative, positive and neutral.

05:13.103 --> 05:16.728
But in human beings there are ten valencies,

05:18.684 --> 05:23.455
and these ten valencies are created

05:23.674 --> 05:28.471
by Shri Vishnu, within us.

05:29.679 --> 05:35.419
They are protected, looked after, and nourished by Shri Vishnu.

05:37.921 --> 05:42.828
And whenever He finds human beings falling down in their dharma

05:43.068 --> 05:47.191
He takes His birth on this earth.

05:50.151 --> 05:52.881
Ultimate stage is the Virat.

05:54.048 --> 05:56.048
At that stage,

05:56.690 --> 06:03.690
this Vishnu principle divides into two:

06:06.531 --> 06:12.636
one goes to Virat, another to Viratangana.

06:15.155 --> 06:18.105
But the third principle is

06:21.562 --> 06:25.727
what you call as the Mahavishnu,

06:27.309 --> 06:32.691
which incarnated as Lord Jesus Christ.

06:34.517 --> 06:40.119
So all these three principles act,

06:40.357 --> 06:45.632
at this time, in Sahasrara mainly.

06:48.664 --> 06:54.222
So, the Virat is the principle in which you can see that

06:54.652 --> 07:01.017
the message of inner dharma is spreading all over the world.

07:03.222 --> 07:07.646
Not only that it is said in modern times

07:07.983 --> 07:11.962
that you don't do this, don't do that, don't, don't do that...no.

07:12.215 --> 07:16.649
No ten commandments. These Ten Commandments

07:16.849 --> 07:19.604
have to become your own nature.

07:20.948 --> 07:25.500
You are to be completely identified with this nature.

07:25.717 --> 07:29.006
So, in the evolutionary process if you see...

07:29.206 --> 07:35.921
well, it was the job of the guru to establish these dharmas into you,

07:38.662 --> 07:41.757
and by these establishments

07:41.978 --> 07:47.735
you were made a person who was dharmic.

07:48.622 --> 07:53.194
But if you see in the world,

07:53.902 --> 07:59.215
whatever is told, written down,

07:59.760 --> 08:04.284
explained verbally, becomes a lip service.

08:05.661 --> 08:09.035
That's why we see
all the religions,

08:09.126 --> 08:12.401
who preached about the same things,

08:12.832 --> 08:17.533
and they all have gone in different lines.

08:18.233 --> 08:22.960
Some are money oriented, some are power oriented,

08:23.160 --> 08:26.599
some are violent,

08:26.799 --> 08:30.409
and some are absolutely false.

08:32.113 --> 08:38.239
So when you see this, you are amazed how

08:39.747 --> 08:45.643
this principle of dharma has been ruined

08:46.432 --> 08:51.416
by human beings.

08:51.880 --> 08:54.806
Why could they not accept dharma?

08:56.436 --> 09:01.908
I have to say that there are two genes within us,

09:02.887 --> 09:10.307
which are meant to protect us from committing sins against the Mother,

09:10.507 --> 09:13.428
and committing sins against the Father.

09:15.303 --> 09:19.233
Those two genes get into mutation

09:20.443 --> 09:23.300
and then people start doing whatever they like,

09:23.500 --> 09:25.500
there is no control over them.

09:26.789 --> 09:31.107
And this is what happened during our evolution.

09:32.225 --> 09:34.506
I would say in India, traditionally, people

09:34.706 --> 09:38.303
are dharmic, very dharmic.

09:38.503 --> 09:41.759
The reason is for ancient times

09:41.959 --> 09:46.887
we have talked of dharma, we had saints,

09:47.374 --> 09:54.374
and then there was a kind of a tradition built in - for thousands of years.

09:56.008 --> 10:02.991
At that time we had also Egypt with us.

10:03.191 --> 10:08.349
But in Egypt, and also in Greece,

10:10.866 --> 10:14.286
something went wrong with them

10:14.586 --> 10:18.234
that... We'll take the case of Greece,

10:18.578 --> 10:22.827
where they make all the Gods look like human beings.

10:23.560 --> 10:27.766
They brought down the level of Gods from dharma to adharma.

10:29.403 --> 10:31.551
And in Egypt,

10:31.777 --> 10:35.473
because of the kings of those countries,

10:35.673 --> 10:37.673
who were very much interested in the death,

10:38.957 --> 10:47.858
in their... what you call... graves, in building pyramids,

10:48.058 --> 10:52.719
all such things, not building up inside the dharma.

10:53.396 --> 10:58.557
This is a reason why in Egypt also the dharma went down very much

10:58.757 --> 11:02.608
and ultimately, now, Islam established there

11:06.678 --> 11:10.140
Islam came because people were adharmic.

11:10.615 --> 11:16.228
Also, in Greece they accepted Orthodox Church because people had become adharmic.

11:17.971 --> 11:22.660
But these religions themselves were adharmic.

11:23.110 --> 11:26.033
They could not instill dharma within themselves,

11:26.250 --> 11:29.873
so how could they instill dharma into these people?

11:31.242 --> 11:36.506
And this happened very much in these countries,

11:36.806 --> 11:47.757
and Vishnu's avataran, as they say, as a Narasimha

11:48.413 --> 11:52.425
came very near, very near Greece

11:53.161 --> 11:58.875
and very near Egypt - that is in Peshawar.

12:02.711 --> 12:07.818
In Peshawar these things happened,

12:08.107 --> 12:11.036
so it was very close also

12:11.696 --> 12:14.724
to Egypt and to Greece.

12:15.504 --> 12:26.855
But they became very much against Vishnu,

12:28.568 --> 12:32.052
because they thought their king was killed by them and all that.

12:32.267 --> 12:38.000
So all these rakshashas entered into the area

12:38.281 --> 12:49.325
in Afghanistan and then they came to Egypt and to Greece,

12:50.068 --> 12:55.398
and tried to bring all the Gods and Goddesses to the ground.

12:56.848 --> 13:02.737
Long time back, must be at least ten thousand years back

13:03.091 --> 13:08.356
when Prahalada brought in the incarnation of Shri Vishnu.

13:10.101 --> 13:15.425
These rakshasas went into their... called as asuras,

13:15.625 --> 13:18.826
asyrians they call, but asuras they were.

13:19.258 --> 13:23.553
And if you go to Egypt you'll find the Sphinx there.

13:24.314 --> 13:29.661
Just the opposite of what Narasimha was.

13:30.789 --> 13:42.721
The man is in upper part and the lion is in the lower part.

13:43.299 --> 13:46.152
But Narasimha is just the opposite.

13:46.352 --> 13:57.989
Narasimha is the lion in the upper part and the human in the lower part.

13:59.461 --> 14:05.520
So they created this kind of a image which was just the opposite of Vishnu.

14:06.373 --> 14:10.431
Â Because, just to show that we have

14:10.631 --> 14:12.077
[Hindi/Marathi]

14:12.277 --> 14:17.578
we have another kind of a big incarnation,

14:17.778 --> 14:21.910
which is just the opposite and can fight Vishnu very well.

14:23.741 --> 14:30.063
With these rakshasas entering into these people,

14:30.567 --> 14:33.867
they developed a very aggressive nature.

14:34.749 --> 14:37.829
Fighting nature, aggressive nature,

14:38.114 --> 14:41.188
they developed their muscles in Greece very much,

14:41.508 --> 14:44.138
and the whole of history

14:44.392 --> 14:47.947
of Greece if you read, it's really maddening.

14:49.037 --> 14:52.174
One fighting another, another fighting another,

14:52.374 --> 14:56.205
they were killing each other, they were...I mean, there's no end to it.

14:58.075 --> 15:01.789
Till Alexander came to India and he saw a culture

15:02.125 --> 15:04.790
which was dharmic, and he was quiet surprised.

15:06.222 --> 15:09.155
How these people lived with symbols and all that.

15:09.355 --> 15:12.148
He said: "All right I had enough of it." He went back.

15:13.507 --> 15:19.888
But in Egypt also they could not understand dharma at all.

15:20.586 --> 15:29.596
Because, they believed in the dead, all kinds of black magic and all that.

15:32.482 --> 15:35.873
So when the Islam came, they accepted Islam.

15:36.552 --> 15:41.120
So here came Christianity, and there came Islam.

15:42.519 --> 15:44.921
They say in Russia,

15:45.877 --> 15:48.551
Tsar wanted to have some religion.

15:50.173 --> 15:52.104
So these...out of these,

15:52.338 --> 15:57.367
he asked the Christians; first he asked the Catholics

15:59.673 --> 16:06.673
to come and make them, all of them, religious.

16:07.002 --> 16:09.820
Because he wanted to have some religion.

16:10.483 --> 16:17.358
The essence is Vishnu. But these perverted Vishnu swarupas were there.

16:18.320 --> 16:24.455
Now they went into Russia, one by one.

16:24.737 --> 16:29.048
So first came the Catholics,

16:29.283 --> 16:32.517
and Catholics said, "You can't have so many wives.

16:33.649 --> 16:38.949
You can only have one wife." So they said, "This won't fit us."

16:41.433 --> 16:48.405
Vishnu had only one wife. Ekapatnivrat - one wife.

16:49.671 --> 16:52.500
Even in Rama's life, same thing.

16:53.876 --> 17:02.556
Then, they called for Muslims.

17:04.134 --> 17:09.720
So Muslims said that: "Alright, you can have many wives,

17:10.258 --> 17:13.015
but no drinking, no vodka."

17:14.150 --> 17:17.733
So they said, "How are we to live without vodka?"

17:18.424 --> 17:21.959
In all these religions there's a little,

17:22.227 --> 17:26.627
you see, part of dharma.

17:27.074 --> 17:30.957
In the first one, only one wife

17:31.233 --> 17:35.024
in the second one, Islam, no drinking.

17:35.230 --> 17:38.416
They said: "No, no, no, we can't live with that kind of."

17:38.616 --> 17:43.507
Then they sent for Orthodox Christians. Orthodox. Orthodox is the word.

17:44.351 --> 17:46.591
And the Orthodox said,

17:46.873 --> 17:49.916
"You can have as many wives you like,

17:50.233 --> 17:52.942
and you can drink as much as you like."

17:54.241 --> 18:00.796
They said, "This fits our dharma." And they accepted.

18:02.591 --> 18:07.930
So any kind of restrictions you put on human beings, any kind,

18:09.258 --> 18:15.395
without realization, they will do exactly what is destructive.

18:17.108 --> 18:20.967
I have seen the Muslims now, for example.

18:22.118 --> 18:26.787
Once I was coming from Riyadh, going to London,

18:28.483 --> 18:34.050
I went off to sleep. When I got up I saw all very fashionable women

18:34.250 --> 18:40.812
with all exposed bodies and very fashionable men

18:41.025 --> 18:43.479
with bow ties and all that.

18:43.679 --> 18:45.481
I said, "What has happened?"

18:45.684 --> 18:48.098
So I asked the airhostess, "Where did we stop?"

18:48.406 --> 18:50.103
She said, "Nowhere."

18:50.303 --> 18:52.564
I said, "From where these people have come?"

18:52.764 --> 18:54.964
She said, "They are the same."

18:56.051 --> 18:58.696
In Riyadh, they would cover their faces;

18:58.896 --> 19:01.346
they'll cover themselves with this.

19:01.546 --> 19:04.928
My son-in-law told me that, "I can't say I'm traveling,

19:05.128 --> 19:07.712
I am going with you who is my Mother-in-law.

19:07.912 --> 19:09.494
I'll be arrested."

19:09.694 --> 19:12.473
Even a mother-in-law, you cannot go.

19:13.025 --> 19:17.002
Only she should be your mother. Thank God our surnames were the same.

19:17.505 --> 19:23.163
So nobody arrested us. Such stupid things you know.

19:23.540 --> 19:26.473
Keeping women away, men away,

19:26.673 --> 19:30.613
then telling the women, "You can't do this, you can't do that."

19:33.405 --> 19:36.208
And men doing all kinds of things.

19:37.033 --> 19:43.205
All this results into a very bad hypocrisy.

19:43.808 --> 19:46.175
Same with Christians.

19:46.557 --> 19:50.843
If you read Christ, what He has said is so tremendous

19:51.043 --> 19:53.645
that for everything He said...

19:54.304 --> 19:59.544
For example, He said... They say there should not be any adultery,

19:59.811 --> 20:05.610
but He says: "Even you should not have adulterous eyes

20:05.810 --> 20:09.163
and it should not even come into your mind."

20:09.504 --> 20:14.124
Can you imagine what He said? Now, tell me about Christian nations

20:14.324 --> 20:18.398
where women are becoming nude, naked, this men are

20:18.598 --> 20:22.186
looking at them, and there's a nonsense going on everywhere.

20:22.386 --> 20:24.671
Can you believe that these are Christians,

20:24.871 --> 20:28.532
and then on Sunday, wear your hat and go to church?

20:30.595 --> 20:33.079
How can you call them Christians?

20:35.765 --> 20:38.064
There is no dharma at all.

20:38.833 --> 20:42.442
Going to church is another hypocrisy.

20:43.317 --> 20:46.061
And the amount of licentiousness

20:47.189 --> 20:50.567
that has come in the western countries

20:50.951 --> 20:55.172
is the limit that one can reach.

20:55.389 --> 21:02.322
They do it in such a way that even animals won't do.

21:03.617 --> 21:11.347
The whole lifestyle is such: how to find our destruction.

21:13.112 --> 21:15.561
They want to destroy themselves.

21:17.306 --> 21:21.248
Why it doesn't happen in India so much?

21:21.632 --> 21:28.137
Because they know it is sin, they know it is sin.

21:28.502 --> 21:33.212
But then you have such things here,

21:33.485 --> 21:37.352
that a priest is abusing children.

21:37.834 --> 21:42.434
How can you? You are a priest. Have some shame.

21:43.698 --> 21:48.820
Even in India there are priests like that. But not to this extent.

21:49.505 --> 21:51.809
That in the colleges and schools

21:52.009 --> 21:56.482
you find the higher authorities of the Catholic Church are doing.

21:56.712 --> 21:59.885
Look at this Catholic Church. What sort of a Catholic Church it is?

22:00.184 --> 22:02.566
Catholic means

22:04.913 --> 22:08.531
sanatan, is from the ancient,

22:08.731 --> 22:13.815
coming from the ancient. Sanatan - it's coming the first.

22:14.918 --> 22:17.050
Where is it?

22:18.108 --> 22:20.854
How can you... call themselves Catholics?

22:21.088 --> 22:24.364
They are the most modern gutters, that's what they are.

22:24.998 --> 22:27.205
What good thing are they doing?

22:27.405 --> 22:29.499
When I read about this Catholic Church,

22:29.700 --> 22:33.794
I think these people should really disappear into Arabian Sea.

22:34.735 --> 22:37.212
Because they are killing people,

22:37.446 --> 22:39.866
all right: then they are making money,

22:40.066 --> 22:42.336
then they are one with the mafia,

22:42.619 --> 22:46.047
they are bestowing awards on the mafia leader.

22:46.387 --> 22:50.763
Is this the Catholic Church? Is this what Christ wanted?

22:50.963 --> 22:52.847
So juxtaposition.

22:53.047 --> 22:55.494
Christ is here and this is in juxtaposition,

22:55.755 --> 22:58.417
absolutely a different thing.

22:58.617 --> 23:01.893
Whatever was dharma is not there at all.

23:03.298 --> 23:05.652
So where do we go?

23:06.164 --> 23:10.818
If you think that becoming a Buddha,

23:11.128 --> 23:15.023
Buddhist, you are all right, absolutely you don't know how Buddhists are.

23:15.264 --> 23:22.797
They are the greatest beggars, and the greediest people. Very money oriented.

23:23.086 --> 23:29.176
I know how many people have lost all their property because of this Dalai Lama.

23:32.084 --> 23:34.851
So now, where is the dharma?

23:37.794 --> 23:40.456
Dharma is within,

23:41.144 --> 23:47.381
and that is why this Vishnu principle is to be awakened within yourself.

23:48.793 --> 23:55.505
And this principle then expands into many ways.

23:55.705 --> 24:03.682
Because Vishnu is the one who is, the one who cures.

24:05.164 --> 24:09.161
We call Him a Dhanvantari - means a doctor.

24:09.620 --> 24:15.640
He is the one who cures because He is our preserver;

24:16.839 --> 24:19.874
He is the preserver of human beings.

24:20.481 --> 24:24.102
So if He preserve your dharma,

24:24.914 --> 24:27.310
then you don't get sick.

24:28.237 --> 24:30.340
And if you get sick,

24:30.540 --> 24:34.120
it is Vishnu who will preserve,

24:34.591 --> 24:36.505
who will cure you.

24:36.727 --> 24:39.682
So He is the one who is,

24:39.882 --> 24:43.335
we can call, Dhanvantari - is a doctor.

24:45.757 --> 24:48.640
Also, He is Yama.

24:50.384 --> 24:56.965
Yama means the one who is responsible for our death.

24:58.453 --> 25:01.544
Of course, the Shiva,

25:01.744 --> 25:07.755
the... we can call, the principle of existence...

25:08.840 --> 25:11.069
spirit has to go first,

25:11.440 --> 25:15.112
and then Yama comes to take charge of the body.

25:16.501 --> 25:19.916
It is He who decides:

25:20.779 --> 25:23.740
Where should you go? Should you hang in the limbo?

25:23.940 --> 25:26.301
Or should we send to the hell?

25:26.730 --> 25:29.238
Or if you can go to heaven?

25:29.675 --> 25:32.544
All decision is taken by Him,

25:33.178 --> 25:37.968
with the help of Mahavishnu - that is Christ.

25:39.978 --> 25:44.685
So His job is to come when there is a dead body lying,

25:44.896 --> 25:49.315
to take away the spirit, and judge the spirit

25:49.576 --> 25:52.605
and put it in its proper place.

25:53.737 --> 25:57.465
Now a person who is an adharmi, supposing...

25:58.509 --> 26:00.697
Such a person

26:01.583 --> 26:06.302
He takes him out and puts him into hell.

26:07.350 --> 26:10.298
But before it is done, sometimes,

26:10.779 --> 26:13.577
these black magic people arrive,

26:13.777 --> 26:18.743
take away the skull of such a dead body -

26:18.943 --> 26:22.068
because when you are burned, the skull is still left -

26:22.446 --> 26:26.813
or the bones and try to control the spirit.

26:27.179 --> 26:30.873
Before Yama enters onto the scene.

26:31.716 --> 26:37.881
Thus, they utilize that person, his spirit,

26:38.392 --> 26:42.182
and manipulate it, and use it

26:42.417 --> 26:46.885
to harm others, or to entice other; they control them.

26:47.536 --> 26:49.949
So, this is the greatest adharma.

26:50.733 --> 26:56.721
This is the worst thing that one can do - is to take away the spirit

26:57.041 --> 27:03.840
and use it for mesmerism or enticing.

27:06.587 --> 27:11.058
But at the death of such a person, such a tantrika,

27:11.857 --> 27:15.497
Yama gives him most

27:15.961 --> 27:22.099
horrible death in the sense that the spirit doesn't go out easily.

27:22.576 --> 27:26.350
And such a person suffers,

27:26.589 --> 27:32.480
suffers and wants the release, but he cannot get a release,

27:32.740 --> 27:38.050
and it's a very big ordeal for that person to die.

27:39.317 --> 27:49.805
It's a punishment of being such a horrible tantrika

27:50.005 --> 27:55.528
that you have tortured so many lives.

27:56.911 --> 28:03.065
So the idea of sin came through dharma and adharma.

28:04.825 --> 28:12.166
We have idea of sin which is very superficial sometimes.

28:14.994 --> 28:20.831
For example, when Arjuna was fighting in the war,

28:21.752 --> 28:25.754
He said, "How can I kill these people?

28:26.477 --> 28:28.971
They are my brothers, they are my sis...,

28:29.171 --> 28:33.693
my relations, uncles, how can I kill them?"

28:34.149 --> 28:37.152
Shri Krishna said, "They are already dead.

28:38.237 --> 28:40.281
You are not going to kill."

28:40.481 --> 28:42.481
So...how are they dead? -

28:43.522 --> 28:48.308
Because they are on the side of adharma. So they are already killed.

28:50.008 --> 28:55.855
But you are on the side of dharma, and if you fight for dharma,

28:56.122 --> 29:01.029
then even if you die, you will be saved.

29:01.590 --> 29:07.259
Now this is stretched too far in many scriptures also

29:07.828 --> 29:09.697
Which is very absurd.

29:09.974 --> 29:12.178
Like saying that if you die,

29:12.378 --> 29:16.096
and bury yourself - it is no soul they talk of -

29:16.296 --> 29:19.799
bury your body, then from the body

29:19.999 --> 29:22.107
after five hundred years,

29:22.307 --> 29:25.788
your body will come out, and you will be saved.

29:26.801 --> 29:30.658
After five hundred years, what will remain of the body?

29:31.701 --> 29:36.189
Such absurd ideas there are in these three religions:

29:36.412 --> 29:41.525
Christian, Jews and Muslims.

29:41.817 --> 29:44.155
That's why they bury people.

29:44.442 --> 29:47.614
Now burying people means you are occupying the land,

29:48.157 --> 29:51.076
and also keeping the bhoots there.

29:51.276 --> 29:53.856
Like in... I was surprised,

29:54.056 --> 29:58.465
when I first came to Paris, that in the center of Paris

29:58.665 --> 30:02.227
they have got such a big cemetery.

30:03.137 --> 30:05.181
Naturally, people drink here -

30:05.391 --> 30:09.638
because most of the drunkards are sitting there inside the graves

30:09.900 --> 30:12.578
and they are inciting them to drink.

30:14.267 --> 30:18.214
It's very surprising that in the West

30:28.617 --> 30:31.796
they have such absurd ideas

30:32.124 --> 30:37.348
that when you'll be buried, then you'll be resurrected like Christ.

30:37.711 --> 30:42.484
Just imagine... Christ was resurrected between three days.

30:43.181 --> 30:48.252
He died on Friday, resurrected on Sunday morning. Not even three days.

30:48.507 --> 30:51.991
But if you keep some body for five hundred years,

30:52.260 --> 30:55.453
who is not even Christ, - if Christ's body, is different -

30:55.663 --> 30:59.748
what will come out of it? And so they are burying people.

31:00.647 --> 31:04.067
Only realised souls should be buried,

31:05.767 --> 31:08.346
not every common person.

31:09.058 --> 31:13.551
Because they still have their desires, their...

31:13.770 --> 31:17.495
they still want some things, their souls might be

31:17.695 --> 31:21.754
hanging around there...you see...that body.

31:22.196 --> 31:30.519
So, why should you keep the body in a place for years together?

31:30.888 --> 31:35.947
Then, after sometime, they'll dig it up and make houses there.

31:36.816 --> 31:41.161
And all the bhoots must... coming in the house.

31:41.902 --> 31:45.296
So to understand dharma, we should also understand

31:45.569 --> 31:50.711
how we are going to deal with the death of general people

31:51.106 --> 31:53.906
and the death of Sahaja Yogis.

31:56.367 --> 31:59.668
Only if you are dharmic, it is not sufficient.

31:59.868 --> 32:02.814
There are many people who don't do anything wrong,

32:03.014 --> 32:05.750
they're very austere type, something,

32:05.950 --> 32:10.847
but they are not in balance, normally. They're very hot tempered.

32:11.151 --> 32:14.971
If they are not hot tempered, they're absolutely recluses,

32:15.171 --> 32:18.335
sit in the Himalayas, like that.

32:18.756 --> 32:23.362
But those people who are dharmic - in the real sense of the word -

32:24.355 --> 32:29.612
once they ascend to the state of Virat,

32:30.110 --> 32:34.376
then only they are the people

32:34.654 --> 32:38.549
who should be preserved, their body should be preserved.

32:38.784 --> 32:45.784
Because the dharma from the nabhi goes to your brain,

32:46.797 --> 32:53.679
and brain supplies to all the nerves the energy of the spirit.

32:54.854 --> 33:01.854
So the whole body of a realized soul is full of vibratory awareness.

33:02.937 --> 33:10.452
If such a body is buried, you can even get fragrance.

33:11.529 --> 33:19.053
And from a distance you will know that there is some saint being buried here.

33:20.739 --> 33:24.144
If you remember, there are seven photographs of Mine,

33:24.344 --> 33:26.614
where the light is falling on Me.

33:26.912 --> 33:29.497
That was a village called Mian ki takli.

33:29.759 --> 33:33.291
They told me then, "Mianh, one Sufi saint,

33:33.491 --> 33:36.227
died in this place. So He is buried here."

33:36.942 --> 33:39.931
Immediately, I felt the vibrations.

33:40.730 --> 33:44.477
And when I was sitting on the dais,

33:45.034 --> 33:50.751
I saw Him in the
form of light, and

33:51.038 --> 33:53.915
He started throwing light on Me.

33:54.163 --> 33:57.528
And I was very happy; but when I stopped, He stopped it.

34:01.225 --> 34:04.860
He didn't become a bhoot. No, He did not.

34:05.063 --> 34:07.203
He became the light.

34:07.403 --> 34:12.916
And wherever it was necessary, He showed His presence.

34:14.249 --> 34:16.911
So, we are following some dharmas.

34:17.111 --> 34:22.909
In Sahaja Yoga you are supposed to follow Vishnu principle.

34:23.729 --> 34:26.365
You have to follow Vishnu principle.

34:26.565 --> 34:31.767
You cannot say that, "Mother, we cannot do it."

34:31.967 --> 34:36.047
For example, Vishnu doesn't like smoking.

34:36.720 --> 34:39.745
Tobacco, He doesn't like.

34:40.109 --> 34:42.878
He doesn't like alcohol.

34:43.501 --> 34:49.502
He doesn't like these drugs. He hates drugs.

34:50.039 --> 34:54.687
He doesn't like many medicines that human beings are producing.

34:55.334 --> 34:59.921
For example these antibiotics, if a
Sahaja Yogi takes, he'll vomit -

35:00.732 --> 35:02.929
If he's a real Sahaja Yogi.

35:03.882 --> 35:07.584
Whatever maybe the quantity, whatever maybe the quality,

35:07.784 --> 35:12.286
so many medicines he cannot take.

35:14.036 --> 35:17.751
So, automatically you become like a Brahmin who avoids:

35:17.951 --> 35:20.282
"No, no, not this."

35:20.482 --> 35:24.062
Then you won't go and have food in a place

35:24.637 --> 35:29.140
where there are people who are against Sahaja Yoga,

35:29.340 --> 35:32.789
or who are not dharmic at all. You won't like it.

35:33.647 --> 35:35.469
I don't have to tell you

35:35.712 --> 35:40.287
that don't look at the women - you won't. You won't look at, automatically.

35:40.722 --> 35:44.140
Your eyes, out of dharma, will become steady.

35:44.340 --> 35:47.447
Nor will I have to tell women that they shouldn't run after men.

35:47.647 --> 35:52.050
Very few are like that who are struggling still.

35:52.272 --> 35:55.635
But most of you just drop all these bad habits,

35:55.866 --> 35:59.200
and come to a state where

35:59.400 --> 36:03.158
you just automatically become dharmic.

36:03.913 --> 36:06.948
Because when the Kundalini rises

36:07.746 --> 36:14.122
and occupies your brain,

36:15.398 --> 36:19.932
then you understand what is right, what is wrong;

36:20.625 --> 36:26.201
through your vibrations you will not take something that is not good.

36:26.887 --> 36:30.389
Food, you will see vibrations is not good, you will not eat.

36:31.393 --> 36:34.917
Anything that is not suitable, you will just say, 'No.'

36:35.117 --> 36:39.019
I don't have to tell you: "Don't do this, don't do that."

36:39.244 --> 36:41.262
You will never kill anyone;

36:41.462 --> 36:45.030
you will never commit any sin, automatically.

36:45.380 --> 36:47.989
I don't have to tell you: "Don't do this,

36:48.204 --> 36:50.497
don't commit this sin, don't commit that sin."

36:50.732 --> 36:53.688
Of course, if you are not yet a matured Sahaja Yogi

36:53.888 --> 36:57.704
then maybe. But with maturity,

36:58.532 --> 37:02.934
I don't think you will take to wrong things. And you'll enjoy your virtues.

37:03.745 --> 37:08.263
The things that are called are virtues, are Vishnu principles.

37:09.664 --> 37:13.554
You say: "This man is virtuous," is very limited.

37:13.754 --> 37:17.679
In the mundane language 'he his virtuous' maybe:

37:17.879 --> 37:21.423
he is good at drawings or something;

37:22.862 --> 37:25.022
nothing more than that.

37:25.222 --> 37:29.195
But, if you say: "Virtuous",

37:29.414 --> 37:32.444
it means he's a Sahaja Yogi.

37:33.990 --> 37:40.079
Now, Christ has gone so far, that if somebody slaps you

37:40.279 --> 37:43.771
on your left cheek, you turn the right to that person.

37:44.511 --> 37:47.765
Now think of it: How subtle He's gone -

37:48.880 --> 37:54.363
- In patience and tolerance. Now think of the Christian Nations,

37:54.785 --> 37:58.786
which went all around the world and plundered.

37:59.282 --> 38:03.412
Spanish went to America, killed all these people there;

38:03.679 --> 38:06.895
English came to India, killed so many people there.

38:07.158 --> 38:13.435
Then some French also went to various African countries and finished them off.

38:14.429 --> 38:16.988
These are supposed to be Christians?

38:17.188 --> 38:20.977
By what means are they Christians?

38:24.536 --> 38:30.332
Not only that you have to ...not to aggress, that's not the only point.

38:30.532 --> 38:33.048
If somebody aggresses you,

38:33.248 --> 38:36.729
then you turn your another cheek to that person.

38:37.863 --> 38:40.238
This was said by Christ.

38:40.496 --> 38:43.940
Every ten.... every commandment

38:44.140 --> 38:48.950
He has tried to bring down to the level of Sahaja Yogis.

38:50.157 --> 38:55.231
How the beauty of Sahaja Yoga will shine through you.

38:55.864 --> 38:58.889
And how you will express your spirit -

38:59.232 --> 39:02.150
it is in the Matthews, I think second chapter.

39:02.473 --> 39:05.679
Where "the blessed are" written down, after that.

39:07.252 --> 39:11.374
It's clearly written down what you should be.

39:11.735 --> 39:17.199
How tolerant, how patient, how compassionate, how loving.

39:17.399 --> 39:24.027
It is remarkable how such a great incarnation

39:24.621 --> 39:31.223
of Lord Jesus Christ was brought to such a low level by Christians.

39:31.607 --> 39:34.409
They have no business to call them Christians.

39:34.609 --> 39:37.503
They are the greatest heathens I could think of.

39:37.703 --> 39:41.551
The way they have ruined their culture, everything.

39:43.706 --> 39:47.889
What about Islam? Islam...

39:50.737 --> 39:53.892
as in the Bible, Paul has
done all the mischief

39:54.092 --> 39:56.648
- I don't know, he must
be another rakshasa.

39:56.887 --> 40:00.720
Islam, also Koran was written by a very horrible fellow.

40:01.072 --> 40:06.198
Mohammed Sahib never knew how to read and write. And there was one fellow

40:06.398 --> 40:10.926
called as Mohayya.

40:11.254 --> 40:12.895
He was such a horrible fellow;

40:13.140 --> 40:15.869
he authorized Bible [could Shri Mataji mean Koran?], just like Paul.

40:16.266 --> 40:21.614
In that he put this Shariat. Now Shariat was meant for...

40:22.172 --> 40:25.157
for irmaia what you say in English? -

40:25.411 --> 40:32.660
- Jeremiah. In Jeremiah... Jeremiah has written that when Moses came

40:34.829 --> 40:37.927
Adi Guru - He came

40:38.703 --> 40:41.095
with the message of ten commandments

40:41.295 --> 40:45.025
from the hill of Tur - He found these Jews

40:45.225 --> 40:50.330
going into complete decadent society, which we see today around ourselves.

40:50.679 --> 40:53.412
And He was so angry,

40:53.612 --> 40:58.578
that He said that: "For you, these are the punishments."

40:58.778 --> 41:05.778
But this was Moses, gave to Jews, at that time. Not for today.

41:06.797 --> 41:11.440
But the Muslims are using that left and right among themselves.

41:11.937 --> 41:14.661
And they have become so quarrelsome

41:14.910 --> 41:17.208
that they are fighting among themselves,

41:17.416 --> 41:19.950
and I think they'll kill each other and finish off.

41:21.586 --> 41:24.574
There is no dharma of love;

41:24.774 --> 41:29.657
there is no dharma of compassion.

41:32.465 --> 41:37.878
The one who is not a Muslim is to be killed somehow,

41:38.152 --> 41:41.606
and the one who is a Muslim is also killed,

41:41.827 --> 41:47.057
because any Muslim cannot change his religion, he cannot.

41:47.271 --> 41:50.699
If he is a Muslim, he's a Muslim. He has to die as a Muslim.

41:50.899 --> 41:54.839
If he tries to If he tries to  do anything else, he'll be killed.

41:55.596 --> 42:01.173
If he runs away from the Islam, he'll be killed. It's a prison.

42:01.640 --> 42:05.497
It's a prison, and in that prison, one has to live.

42:05.697 --> 42:09.243
You are not to question anything; you are not to ask for anything.

42:09.749 --> 42:12.798
The other day I was watching the Hajj,

42:13.049 --> 42:17.595
and there was one fellow from Sudan.

42:17.992 --> 42:21.161
He was really like Hitler, talking like Hitler,

42:21.361 --> 42:25.945
and I asked someone to translate it - the Arabic.

42:26.145 --> 42:29.218
And he was just pouring poison.

42:29.432 --> 42:33.526
He was calling everyone as heathens:

42:33.726 --> 42:37.523
"They have no truth with them, we have the truth."

42:37.753 --> 42:40.703
What sort of a truth you have?

42:40.921 --> 42:45.492
What are you... what good are you doing anywhere? What truth you have got?

42:46.311 --> 42:50.228
And he said all these nonsensical things that 'we should kill all those

42:50.428 --> 42:52.428
who don't have the truth,' this, that

42:55.259 --> 42:57.345
And I was looking at it.

42:58.702 --> 43:01.276
And a question came to Me -

43:01.482 --> 43:03.491
he is saying all these things in My presence,

43:03.691 --> 43:06.592
I don't know what's going to happen to all these people.

43:06.968 --> 43:12.000
And second day, there was a stampede of thirty thousand people,

43:12.275 --> 43:15.578
who had gone for Hajj.

43:20.032 --> 43:23.243
So these stupid people in charge of religion

43:23.392 --> 43:26.192
will kill all the Muslims this how,

43:26.303 --> 43:30.133
finish them off, and think that we have achieved a lot.

43:35.200 --> 43:38.161
Then, about the Jews:

43:38.240 --> 43:42.276
Jews have been waiting for a savior and all that.

43:42.412 --> 43:48.206
And they didn't like Christ. But they didn't kill Christ, I must say.

43:48.681 --> 43:54.223
They didn't kill; this was the idea of Paul, to put it.

43:55.183 --> 44:00.127
But the Jews never realized what the dharma is.

44:00.580 --> 44:04.650
Because Moses just gave them such a horrible Shariat.

44:05.414 --> 44:06.871
They never realized.

44:07.022 --> 44:10.135
So they shut the Shariat - 'All right. Nothing doing. We will not have.'

44:10.748 --> 44:14.558
And they became extremely money oriented.

44:14.919 --> 44:18.203
Miserly money oriented.

44:18.941 --> 44:21.663
They lend money to somebody;

44:21.894 --> 44:25.526
that fellow goes on paying the interest, interest, interest.

44:25.746 --> 44:31.241
Then he cannot pay, so they'll confiscate his house, sell it out.

44:32.104 --> 44:36.372
They became very, very, very, very cruel people,

44:36.604 --> 44:42.235
and also licentious, very cruel. So, one rakshasa

44:42.548 --> 44:47.944
called Freud was born in their society. Freud was a Jew.

44:49.702 --> 44:54.516
And people... you see, he understood what is the weaknesses of human beings are,

44:54.865 --> 44:58.898
and he was accepted in that stupid America, very much.

44:59.700 --> 45:05.517
So much so, that they lost all sense of dharma.

45:08.372 --> 45:12.397
When he said all these nonsensical things about the mother,

45:12.647 --> 45:15.633
how could there be any dharma?

45:17.935 --> 45:21.976
Now they are writing, 'Downfall of

45:22.141 --> 45:27.394
Freudian empire, fraudulent Freud,' and now there are so many books coming.

45:31.080 --> 45:34.305
As a result of this, what has happened is,

45:34.630 --> 45:37.827
because you were not so traditionally bound,

45:38.106 --> 45:41.491
and this kind of stupid religions came in the West,

45:44.139 --> 45:47.496
through these destructive people,

45:52.051 --> 45:56.617
you lost faith. Lost complete faith -

45:56.953 --> 46:00.826
'it's alright, go to Church, come back home, what is there?'

46:00.867 --> 46:02.620
Is talking like that...

46:02.792 --> 46:08.019
The priests, the mullahs, and all these leading such a horrible life.

46:08.225 --> 46:11.027
Completely, people lost faith.

46:11.187 --> 46:16.741
And when they lost the faith, they lost their personality.

46:17.927 --> 46:22.503
They lost the personality, and I am surprised

46:22.738 --> 46:26.477
how people follow fashions,

46:26.860 --> 46:29.492
as I told the other day.

46:29.687 --> 46:31.551
They followed fashions.

46:31.739 --> 46:35.691
Anybody says: "You should have skinhead", they'll cut off their hair.

46:35.961 --> 46:39.801
Tomorrow somebody says: "You cut your nose", they'll all cut their noses.

46:41.325 --> 46:44.337
"You dress up like this",

46:44.513 --> 46:49.221
they will dress up like that. Said: "Torn clothes ", all right, torn clothes...

46:50.370 --> 46:57.370
One person starts it, that is the entrepreneur, and everybody follows.

47:01.318 --> 47:06.536
Traditionally, if you had found out that this dress suits you,

47:06.764 --> 47:09.486
should have kept to it. But these entrepreneurs,

47:09.650 --> 47:11.998
whatever they tell you, you take it up.

47:12.242 --> 47:17.638
As if you have no brains. As if you have no capacity to understand.

47:19.241 --> 47:23.091
But for a dharmic person, he'll say: "Get lost."

47:24.029 --> 47:28.684
He won't, he won't change. 'Why should I waste my money?

47:29.778 --> 47:32.858
Accumulate all these nonsensical things?'

47:34.390 --> 47:38.079
So, when I started Sahaja Yoga,

47:38.344 --> 47:41.078
I was reluctant, but I told everyone

47:41.224 --> 47:44.622
that you better put some oil in your head.

47:46.805 --> 47:48.455
You can wash it next day,

47:48.675 --> 47:52.249
but in the night put some oil. Otherwise, after sometime

47:52.304 --> 47:56.623
I'll see all men baldheaded and women wearing wigs.

47:58.133 --> 48:01.732
I am a Mother, so I am going to tell you the truth.

48:03.077 --> 48:05.831
With great difficulties, Sahaja Yogis agreed.

48:05.906 --> 48:08.814
I said: "You can wash it next day."

48:10.368 --> 48:14.774
It is necessary for you to have, is a simple thing like that,

48:15.403 --> 48:19.305
because the hair grow on oil.

48:19.943 --> 48:24.100
Is a very simple thing - I told them that you do like that.

48:24.333 --> 48:28.824
And they would not agree. They would not change it.

48:29.504 --> 48:33.046
But thank God, now, some sense has come.

48:33.171 --> 48:35.319
And they are doing few things,

48:35.553 --> 48:39.180
very few things have to be done, for SahajaYogis,

48:39.327 --> 48:45.349
to get alright in their health, and also in their wealth.

48:45.165 --> 48:48.836
They don't have to do much because they are standing in dharma.

48:49.281 --> 48:53.621
And they are in the Kingdom of God.

48:54.313 --> 48:58.881
They are under the protection of Virat.

48:59.736 --> 49:05.214
But still, there are certain things you have to do, certain things.

49:07.996 --> 49:10.681
I didn't say that: "Don't smoke."

49:10.894 --> 49:16.767
You just gave up yourself. The alcohol, all these things you gave up yourself -

49:16.945 --> 49:20.708
because you have the light. And despite the fact

49:20.962 --> 49:24.198
that you come from a culture where there is no personality,

49:24.375 --> 49:28.393
people are like sheep, now you are not.

49:29.128 --> 49:31.797
Now you are individualistic.

49:32.928 --> 49:36.079
To be individual is impossible in the West.

49:36.329 --> 49:39.881
Because you must dress up the way everybody dresses up.

49:40.255 --> 49:43.913
If they are punks, you'll all move like punks;

49:44.486 --> 49:49.065
if the one woman has this kind of hair, you make the same style.

49:49.640 --> 49:51.943
Specially on the hair, I don't know why.

49:52.142 --> 49:58.122
Maybe it is the power of Virat. It acts mostly on hair.

49:58.701 --> 50:02.984
Then the clothes and everything... you have realized

50:03.428 --> 50:08.781
that chastity is a part of dharma. Is not only women,

50:09.276 --> 50:13.847
it's not the chastity of women, but the chastity of men and women

50:14.084 --> 50:17.114
is their power, is Ganesha's power.

50:17.923 --> 50:23.009
This is the dharma, which you have accepted. I never told you anything,

50:23.268 --> 50:27.897
but you have accepted. And you have imbibed, and you are enjoying it.

50:29.809 --> 50:33.224
Now if they accept us as dharma, what is so special?

50:33.406 --> 50:35.833
We are the only dharma.

50:36.056 --> 50:39.381
The rest are all adharmis. They call themselves dharmic;

50:39.710 --> 50:42.086
they have no dharma in them.

50:43.924 --> 50:46.490
Unless and until you have dharm by which

50:46.704 --> 50:49.976
you get a balance, wisdom, you cannot ascend.

50:50.169 --> 50:53.018
But if you ascend even without dharma,

50:53.207 --> 50:55.461
Sahaja Yoga is so great, I've seen,

50:55.622 --> 50:59.560
people who were quiet adharmic and all that just got realization.

51:00.273 --> 51:04.718
If you ascend, then dharma trickles down; they become dharmic.

51:07.968 --> 51:10.316
So many try to write to me

51:10.583 --> 51:12.735
about their past, I just tear it off, finished.

51:12.880 --> 51:14.395
Now you have become lotuses,

51:14.648 --> 51:18.160
why are you telling me about something I am not interested in?

51:19.343 --> 51:21.470
So, once you get your realization,

51:21.676 --> 51:24.220
this is the best way, and I just thought of this.

51:24.444 --> 51:27.590
Specially when I saw the situation

51:27.813 --> 51:31.557
in the world that was coming in this Kali Yuga, I thought, in this chaos,

51:31.769 --> 51:37.191
'Unless and until you raise their Kundalini, dharma cannot be established.'

51:37.914 --> 51:40.493
This... If I have done anything, I have done this.

51:40.662 --> 51:42.845
Is to find out the method "en masse",

51:42.998 --> 51:45.572
giving realization and the problem will be solved.

51:45.788 --> 51:47.843
You don't have to tell them anything,

51:48.032 --> 51:52.315
'don't do, don't do,' nothing. Just they'll do it.

51:55.453 --> 52:00.715
It was successful, I must say, very successful.

52:01.346 --> 52:07.111
Among you, I find my vision being established.

52:08.259 --> 52:13.014
Whatever concern I had, whatever worry I had about this Paris

52:13.263 --> 52:16.352
is over now, finished.

52:16.893 --> 52:20.119
I used to come three times in a year.

52:20.309 --> 52:24.244
And everybody would say: "Mother what is this? Why do you oblige them so much?"

52:24.458 --> 52:27.881
So I said that: "This is the gate of hell let me go."

52:28.194 --> 52:31.644
And now this has become the gate of heaven.

52:43.703 --> 52:45.969
So, for us not difficult

52:46.286 --> 52:49.423
to establish Vishnu principle within us -

52:49.608 --> 52:52.569
But to recognize that we have those.

52:52.700 --> 52:56.544
You see, suddenly I find Sahaja Yogis become extremely humble.

52:56.607 --> 52:59.050
And they don't want to know what they have.

52:59.171 --> 53:02.605
You can cure people; you are a Dhanvantari.

53:03.244 --> 53:05.419
You can give realization to people.

53:05.574 --> 53:10.019
All Vishnu principles are now awakened within you,

53:10.122 --> 53:11.942
and you must utilize it.

53:12.088 --> 53:14.321
I wish we had Vishnu

53:14.553 --> 53:16.241
[Shri Mataji asks someone there (in Marathi)

53:16.449 --> 53:20.455
if they had Vishnu Sahastranama  - the 1000 names of Shri Vishnu]

53:20.631 --> 53:24.745
Now there are thousand names, which I would not like you to say,

53:24.962 --> 53:28.594
but at least some names of Vishnu if you can say,

53:28.711 --> 53:34.745
you will understand how this Vishnu
principle is awakened in you.

53:34.899 --> 53:37.275
To such an extent

53:38.576 --> 53:42.875
that somebody said: "Mother, no, I don't
want to work in the public."

53:43.035 --> 53:44.435
I said: "Why?"

53:44.590 --> 53:47.583
"I don't want to have that ego back in me."

53:47.695 --> 53:50.046
They are so sweet.

53:50.213 --> 53:52.656
They're afraid of their ego being coming.

53:52.814 --> 53:57.441
No, no, no, no... It won't come back now, because here sits

53:57.603 --> 54:02.552
the Vishnu as Virat. He'll look after you,

54:03.075 --> 54:08.492
and you have that Vishnupad in yourself.

54:14.572 --> 54:17.012
So much could be said about it.

54:17.184 --> 54:21.162
But I think you should read even thousand names of Vishnu

54:25.392 --> 54:30.444
and you will know how many qualities you can have.

54:32.749 --> 54:35.247
May God bless you.
