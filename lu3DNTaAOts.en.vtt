00:00:10.302 --> 00:00:14.372
It is such a great day today

00:00:17.556 --> 00:00:23.539
that the French got their liberation on this day.

00:00:24.377 --> 00:00:28.742
But what is this liberation for? - I don't know.

00:00:30.717 --> 00:00:35.379
In no country where they had freedom and liberation,

00:00:35.837 --> 00:00:43.363
I have seen, it has not worked something very much that was expected.

00:00:47.035 --> 00:00:50.397
Same in France...

00:00:53.425 --> 00:00:56.361
So the liberation through anger,

00:00:58.783 --> 00:01:00.783
when it comes,

00:01:01.552 --> 00:01:03.552
hatred

00:01:07.476 --> 00:01:14.970
is the basis of these revolutions and these

00:01:15.647 --> 00:01:18.748
so called achieved liberations.

00:01:22.245 --> 00:01:29.484
If the liberation takes place within yourself,

00:01:32.964 --> 00:01:36.730
so that you are no more slave of anyone of these

00:01:39.112 --> 00:01:43.551
horrible destructive forces and negative forces,

00:01:44.638 --> 00:01:47.234
then it's a real liberation.

00:01:49.415 --> 00:01:54.789
The second thing that has happened in France, first time in Europe,

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.270
it has been recognized as dharma.

00:02:00.471 --> 00:02:04.121
It's a very big thing, and
give a hand to it.

00:02:17.216 --> 00:02:22.398
It is recognized that Sahaja Yoga is dharma.

00:02:22.598 --> 00:02:28.420
It is. But today it was recognized.

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:31.616
This is a very big thing.

00:02:34.593 --> 00:02:37.398
I must say credit goes to your leader

00:02:37.555 --> 00:02:41.945
and to all the Sahaja yogis of France

00:02:42.247 --> 00:02:47.945
who have worked so hard to get this sanction, this

00:02:48.145 --> 00:02:52.582
kind of a position.

00:02:53.933 --> 00:02:58.057
It's a very great thing.

00:03:00.443 --> 00:03:07.443
So, today I was thinking that we'll have the puja of Shri Vishnu,

00:03:08.347 --> 00:03:11.942
who was the basis of dharma.

00:03:14.572 --> 00:03:19.113
So far we have never worshipped anyone

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:27.223
who were the basics,

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.307
except for Shiva.

00:03:33.961 --> 00:03:40.110
We only worshipped the incarnations because they became as incarnation;

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.549
Ganesha came as incarnation,

00:03:42.745 --> 00:03:45.256
the Goddess came as incarnations,

00:03:45.456 --> 00:03:52.243
Rama, Shri Krishna, Gurus, Christ, Buddha,

00:03:53.212 --> 00:03:57.287
all of them came as incarnations on this earth.

00:03:57.872 --> 00:04:02.258
And we worshipped the incarnations who came on earth

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:10.205
specially. But today, as Sahaja Yoga is established as dharma,

00:04:10.405 --> 00:04:12.871
we have to know about Shri Vishnu

00:04:13.071 --> 00:04:16.695
who is the basis of dharma.

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:28.891
Later on He came on this earth as Shri Ram, then as Shri Krishna,

00:04:29.627 --> 00:04:33.837
and ultimately as Kalki.

00:04:39.581 --> 00:04:43.459
It is a beautiful evolution

00:04:45.233 --> 00:04:48.397
of Shri Vishnu.

00:04:50.283 --> 00:04:53.038
So, one has to understand

00:04:53.238 --> 00:04:58.023
what is the basis of dharma.

00:05:01.484 --> 00:05:05.043
If you know, in the matter they are eight valencies.

00:05:07.222 --> 00:05:10.496
They are negative, positive and neutral.

00:05:13.103 --> 00:05:16.728
But in human beings there are ten valencies,

00:05:18.684 --> 00:05:23.455
and these ten valencies are created

00:05:23.674 --> 00:05:28.471
by Shri Vishnu, within us.

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:35.419
They are protected, looked after, and nourished by Shri Vishnu.

00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:42.828
And whenever He finds human beings falling down in their dharma

00:05:43.068 --> 00:05:47.191
He takes His birth on this earth.

00:05:50.151 --> 00:05:52.881
Ultimate stage is the Virat.

00:05:54.048 --> 00:05:56.048
At that stage,

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:03.690
this Vishnu principle divides into two:

00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:12.636
one goes to Virat, another to Viratangana.

00:06:15.155 --> 00:06:18.105
But the third principle is

00:06:21.562 --> 00:06:25.727
what you call as the Mahavishnu,

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:32.691
which incarnated as Lord Jesus Christ.

00:06:34.517 --> 00:06:40.119
So all these three principles act,

00:06:40.357 --> 00:06:45.632
at this time, in Sahasrara mainly.

00:06:48.664 --> 00:06:54.222
So, the Virat is the principle in which you can see that

00:06:54.652 --> 00:07:01.017
the message of inner dharma is spreading all over the world.

00:07:03.222 --> 00:07:07.646
Not only that it is said in modern times

00:07:07.983 --> 00:07:11.962
that you don't do this, don't do that, don't, don't do that...no.

00:07:12.215 --> 00:07:16.649
No ten commandments. These Ten Commandments

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:19.604
have to become your own nature.

00:07:20.948 --> 00:07:25.500
You are to be completely identified with this nature.

00:07:25.717 --> 00:07:29.006
So, in the evolutionary process if you see...

00:07:29.206 --> 00:07:35.921
well, it was the job of the guru to establish these dharmas into you,

00:07:38.662 --> 00:07:41.757
and by these establishments

00:07:41.978 --> 00:07:47.735
you were made a person who was dharmic.

00:07:48.622 --> 00:07:53.194
But if you see in the world,

00:07:53.902 --> 00:07:59.215
whatever is told, written down,

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:04.284
explained verbally, becomes a lip service.

00:08:05.661 --> 00:08:09.035
That's why we see
all the religions,

00:08:09.126 --> 00:08:12.401
who preached about the same things,

00:08:12.832 --> 00:08:17.533
and they all have gone in different lines.

00:08:18.233 --> 00:08:22.960
Some are money oriented, some are power oriented,

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.599
some are violent,

00:08:26.799 --> 00:08:30.409
and some are absolutely false.

00:08:32.113 --> 00:08:38.239
So when you see this, you are amazed how

00:08:39.747 --> 00:08:45.643
this principle of dharma has been ruined

00:08:46.432 --> 00:08:51.416
by human beings.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.806
Why could they not accept dharma?

00:08:56.436 --> 00:09:01.908
I have to say that there are two genes within us,

00:09:02.887 --> 00:09:10.307
which are meant to protect us from committing sins against the Mother,

00:09:10.507 --> 00:09:13.428
and committing sins against the Father.

00:09:15.303 --> 00:09:19.233
Those two genes get into mutation

00:09:20.443 --> 00:09:23.300
and then people start doing whatever they like,

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.500
there is no control over them.

00:09:26.789 --> 00:09:31.107
And this is what happened during our evolution.

00:09:32.225 --> 00:09:34.506
I would say in India, traditionally, people

00:09:34.706 --> 00:09:38.303
are dharmic, very dharmic.

00:09:38.503 --> 00:09:41.759
The reason is for ancient times

00:09:41.959 --> 00:09:46.887
we have talked of dharma, we had saints,

00:09:47.374 --> 00:09:54.374
and then there was a kind of a tradition built in - for thousands of years.

00:09:56.008 --> 00:10:02.991
At that time we had also Egypt with us.

00:10:03.191 --> 00:10:08.349
But in Egypt, and also in Greece,

00:10:10.866 --> 00:10:14.286
something went wrong with them

00:10:14.586 --> 00:10:18.234
that... We'll take the case of Greece,

00:10:18.578 --> 00:10:22.827
where they make all the Gods look like human beings.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.766
They brought down the level of Gods from dharma to adharma.

00:10:29.403 --> 00:10:31.551
And in Egypt,

00:10:31.777 --> 00:10:35.473
because of the kings of those countries,

00:10:35.673 --> 00:10:37.673
who were very much interested in the death,

00:10:38.957 --> 00:10:47.858
in their... what you call... graves, in building pyramids,

00:10:48.058 --> 00:10:52.719
all such things, not building up inside the dharma.

00:10:53.396 --> 00:10:58.557
This is a reason why in Egypt also the dharma went down very much

00:10:58.757 --> 00:11:02.608
and ultimately, now, Islam established there

00:11:06.678 --> 00:11:10.140
Islam came because people were adharmic.

00:11:10.615 --> 00:11:16.228
Also, in Greece they accepted Orthodox Church because people had become adharmic.

00:11:17.971 --> 00:11:22.660
But these religions themselves were adharmic.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:26.033
They could not instill dharma within themselves,

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.873
so how could they instill dharma into these people?

00:11:31.242 --> 00:11:36.506
And this happened very much in these countries,

00:11:36.806 --> 00:11:47.757
and Vishnu's avataran, as they say, as a Narasimha

00:11:48.413 --> 00:11:52.425
came very near, very near Greece

00:11:53.161 --> 00:11:58.875
and very near Egypt - that is in Peshawar.

00:12:02.711 --> 00:12:07.818
In Peshawar these things happened,

00:12:08.107 --> 00:12:11.036
so it was very close also

00:12:11.696 --> 00:12:14.724
to Egypt and to Greece.

00:12:15.504 --> 00:12:26.855
But they became very much against Vishnu,

00:12:28.568 --> 00:12:32.052
because they thought their king was killed by them and all that.

00:12:32.267 --> 00:12:38.000
So all these rakshashas entered into the area

00:12:38.281 --> 00:12:49.325
in Afghanistan and then they came to Egypt and to Greece,

00:12:50.068 --> 00:12:55.398
and tried to bring all the Gods and Goddesses to the ground.

00:12:56.848 --> 00:13:02.737
Long time back, must be at least ten thousand years back

00:13:03.091 --> 00:13:08.356
when Prahalada brought in the incarnation of Shri Vishnu.

00:13:10.101 --> 00:13:15.425
These rakshasas went into their... called as asuras,

00:13:15.625 --> 00:13:18.826
asyrians they call, but asuras they were.

00:13:19.258 --> 00:13:23.553
And if you go to Egypt you'll find the Sphinx there.

00:13:24.314 --> 00:13:29.661
Just the opposite of what Narasimha was.

00:13:30.789 --> 00:13:42.721
The man is in upper part and the lion is in the lower part.

00:13:43.299 --> 00:13:46.152
But Narasimha is just the opposite.

00:13:46.352 --> 00:13:57.989
Narasimha is the lion in the upper part and the human in the lower part.

00:13:59.461 --> 00:14:05.520
So they created this kind of a image which was just the opposite of Vishnu.

00:14:06.373 --> 00:14:10.431
 Because, just to show that we have

00:14:10.631 --> 00:14:12.077
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:14:12.277 --> 00:14:17.578
we have another kind of a big incarnation,

00:14:17.778 --> 00:14:21.910
which is just the opposite and can fight Vishnu very well.

00:14:23.741 --> 00:14:30.063
With these rakshasas entering into these people,

00:14:30.567 --> 00:14:33.867
they developed a very aggressive nature.

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:37.829
Fighting nature, aggressive nature,

00:14:38.114 --> 00:14:41.188
they developed their muscles in Greece very much,

00:14:41.508 --> 00:14:44.138
and the whole of history

00:14:44.392 --> 00:14:47.947
of Greece if you read, it's really maddening.

00:14:49.037 --> 00:14:52.174
One fighting another, another fighting another,

00:14:52.374 --> 00:14:56.205
they were killing each other, they were...I mean, there's no end to it.

00:14:58.075 --> 00:15:01.789
Till Alexander came to India and he saw a culture

00:15:02.125 --> 00:15:04.790
which was dharmic, and he was quiet surprised.

00:15:06.222 --> 00:15:09.155
How these people lived with symbols and all that.

00:15:09.355 --> 00:15:12.148
He said: "All right I had enough of it." He went back.

00:15:13.507 --> 00:15:19.888
But in Egypt also they could not understand dharma at all.

00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:29.596
Because, they believed in the dead, all kinds of black magic and all that.

00:15:32.482 --> 00:15:35.873
So when the Islam came, they accepted Islam.

00:15:36.552 --> 00:15:41.120
So here came Christianity, and there came Islam.

00:15:42.519 --> 00:15:44.921
They say in Russia,

00:15:45.877 --> 00:15:48.551
Tsar wanted to have some religion.

00:15:50.173 --> 00:15:52.104
So these...out of these,

00:15:52.338 --> 00:15:57.367
he asked the Christians; first he asked the Catholics

00:15:59.673 --> 00:16:06.673
to come and make them, all of them, religious.

00:16:07.002 --> 00:16:09.820
Because he wanted to have some religion.

00:16:10.483 --> 00:16:17.358
The essence is Vishnu. But these perverted Vishnu swarupas were there.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:24.455
Now they went into Russia, one by one.

00:16:24.737 --> 00:16:29.048
So first came the Catholics,

00:16:29.283 --> 00:16:32.517
and Catholics said, "You can't have so many wives.

00:16:33.649 --> 00:16:38.949
You can only have one wife." So they said, "This won't fit us."

00:16:41.433 --> 00:16:48.405
Vishnu had only one wife. Ekapatnivrat - one wife.

00:16:49.671 --> 00:16:52.500
Even in Rama's life, same thing.

00:16:53.876 --> 00:17:02.556
Then, they called for Muslims.

00:17:04.134 --> 00:17:09.720
So Muslims said that: "Alright, you can have many wives,

00:17:10.258 --> 00:17:13.015
but no drinking, no vodka."

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:17.733
So they said, "How are we to live without vodka?"

00:17:18.424 --> 00:17:21.959
In all these religions there's a little,

00:17:22.227 --> 00:17:26.627
you see, part of dharma.

00:17:27.074 --> 00:17:30.957
In the first one, only one wife

00:17:31.233 --> 00:17:35.024
in the second one, Islam, no drinking.

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:38.416
They said: "No, no, no, we can't live with that kind of."

00:17:38.616 --> 00:17:43.507
Then they sent for Orthodox Christians. Orthodox. Orthodox is the word.

00:17:44.351 --> 00:17:46.591
And the Orthodox said,

00:17:46.873 --> 00:17:49.916
"You can have as many wives you like,

00:17:50.233 --> 00:17:52.942
and you can drink as much as you like."

00:17:54.241 --> 00:18:00.796
They said, "This fits our dharma." And they accepted.

00:18:02.591 --> 00:18:07.930
So any kind of restrictions you put on human beings, any kind,

00:18:09.258 --> 00:18:15.395
without realization, they will do exactly what is destructive.

00:18:17.108 --> 00:18:20.967
I have seen the Muslims now, for example.

00:18:22.118 --> 00:18:26.787
Once I was coming from Riyadh, going to London,

00:18:28.483 --> 00:18:34.050
I went off to sleep. When I got up I saw all very fashionable women

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:40.812
with all exposed bodies and very fashionable men

00:18:41.025 --> 00:18:43.479
with bow ties and all that.

00:18:43.679 --> 00:18:45.481
I said, "What has happened?"

00:18:45.684 --> 00:18:48.098
So I asked the airhostess, "Where did we stop?"

00:18:48.406 --> 00:18:50.103
She said, "Nowhere."

00:18:50.303 --> 00:18:52.564
I said, "From where these people have come?"

00:18:52.764 --> 00:18:54.964
She said, "They are the same."

00:18:56.051 --> 00:18:58.696
In Riyadh, they would cover their faces;

00:18:58.896 --> 00:19:01.346
they'll cover themselves with this.

00:19:01.546 --> 00:19:04.928
My son-in-law told me that, "I can't say I'm traveling,

00:19:05.128 --> 00:19:07.712
I am going with you who is my Mother-in-law.

00:19:07.912 --> 00:19:09.494
I'll be arrested."

00:19:09.694 --> 00:19:12.473
Even a mother-in-law, you cannot go.

00:19:13.025 --> 00:19:17.002
Only she should be your mother. Thank God our surnames were the same.

00:19:17.505 --> 00:19:23.163
So nobody arrested us. Such stupid things you know.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:26.473
Keeping women away, men away,

00:19:26.673 --> 00:19:30.613
then telling the women, "You can't do this, you can't do that."

00:19:33.405 --> 00:19:36.208
And men doing all kinds of things.

00:19:37.033 --> 00:19:43.205
All this results into a very bad hypocrisy.

00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:46.175
Same with Christians.

00:19:46.557 --> 00:19:50.843
If you read Christ, what He has said is so tremendous

00:19:51.043 --> 00:19:53.645
that for everything He said...

00:19:54.304 --> 00:19:59.544
For example, He said... They say there should not be any adultery,

00:19:59.811 --> 00:20:05.610
but He says: "Even you should not have adulterous eyes

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:09.163
and it should not even come into your mind."

00:20:09.504 --> 00:20:14.124
Can you imagine what He said? Now, tell me about Christian nations

00:20:14.324 --> 00:20:18.398
where women are becoming nude, naked, this men are

00:20:18.598 --> 00:20:22.186
looking at them, and there's a nonsense going on everywhere.

00:20:22.386 --> 00:20:24.671
Can you believe that these are Christians,

00:20:24.871 --> 00:20:28.532
and then on Sunday, wear your hat and go to church?

00:20:30.595 --> 00:20:33.079
How can you call them Christians?

00:20:35.765 --> 00:20:38.064
There is no dharma at all.

00:20:38.833 --> 00:20:42.442
Going to church is another hypocrisy.

00:20:43.317 --> 00:20:46.061
And the amount of licentiousness

00:20:47.189 --> 00:20:50.567
that has come in the western countries

00:20:50.951 --> 00:20:55.172
is the limit that one can reach.

00:20:55.389 --> 00:21:02.322
They do it in such a way that even animals won't do.

00:21:03.617 --> 00:21:11.347
The whole lifestyle is such: how to find our destruction.

00:21:13.112 --> 00:21:15.561
They want to destroy themselves.

00:21:17.306 --> 00:21:21.248
Why it doesn't happen in India so much?

00:21:21.632 --> 00:21:28.137
Because they know it is sin, they know it is sin.

00:21:28.502 --> 00:21:33.212
But then you have such things here,

00:21:33.485 --> 00:21:37.352
that a priest is abusing children.

00:21:37.834 --> 00:21:42.434
How can you? You are a priest. Have some shame.

00:21:43.698 --> 00:21:48.820
Even in India there are priests like that. But not to this extent.

00:21:49.505 --> 00:21:51.809
That in the colleges and schools

00:21:52.009 --> 00:21:56.482
you find the higher authorities of the Catholic Church are doing.

00:21:56.712 --> 00:21:59.885
Look at this Catholic Church. What sort of a Catholic Church it is?

00:22:00.184 --> 00:22:02.566
Catholic means

00:22:04.913 --> 00:22:08.531
sanatan, is from the ancient,

00:22:08.731 --> 00:22:13.815
coming from the ancient. Sanatan - it's coming the first.

00:22:14.918 --> 00:22:17.050
Where is it?

00:22:18.108 --> 00:22:20.854
How can you... call themselves Catholics?

00:22:21.088 --> 00:22:24.364
They are the most modern gutters, that's what they are.

00:22:24.998 --> 00:22:27.205
What good thing are they doing?

00:22:27.405 --> 00:22:29.499
When I read about this Catholic Church,

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:33.794
I think these people should really disappear into Arabian Sea.

00:22:34.735 --> 00:22:37.212
Because they are killing people,

00:22:37.446 --> 00:22:39.866
all right: then they are making money,

00:22:40.066 --> 00:22:42.336
then they are one with the mafia,

00:22:42.619 --> 00:22:46.047
they are bestowing awards on the mafia leader.

00:22:46.387 --> 00:22:50.763
Is this the Catholic Church? Is this what Christ wanted?

00:22:50.963 --> 00:22:52.847
So juxtaposition.

00:22:53.047 --> 00:22:55.494
Christ is here and this is in juxtaposition,

00:22:55.755 --> 00:22:58.417
absolutely a different thing.

00:22:58.617 --> 00:23:01.893
Whatever was dharma is not there at all.

00:23:03.298 --> 00:23:05.652
So where do we go?

00:23:06.164 --> 00:23:10.818
If you think that becoming a Buddha,

00:23:11.128 --> 00:23:15.023
Buddhist, you are all right, absolutely you don't know how Buddhists are.

00:23:15.264 --> 00:23:22.797
They are the greatest beggars, and the greediest people. Very money oriented.

00:23:23.086 --> 00:23:29.176
I know how many people have lost all their property because of this Dalai Lama.

00:23:32.084 --> 00:23:34.851
So now, where is the dharma?

00:23:37.794 --> 00:23:40.456
Dharma is within,

00:23:41.144 --> 00:23:47.381
and that is why this Vishnu principle is to be awakened within yourself.

00:23:48.793 --> 00:23:55.505
And this principle then expands into many ways.

00:23:55.705 --> 00:24:03.682
Because Vishnu is the one who is, the one who cures.

00:24:05.164 --> 00:24:09.161
We call Him a Dhanvantari - means a doctor.

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:15.640
He is the one who cures because He is our preserver;

00:24:16.839 --> 00:24:19.874
He is the preserver of human beings.

00:24:20.481 --> 00:24:24.102
So if He preserve your dharma,

00:24:24.914 --> 00:24:27.310
then you don't get sick.

00:24:28.237 --> 00:24:30.340
And if you get sick,

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:34.120
it is Vishnu who will preserve,

00:24:34.591 --> 00:24:36.505
who will cure you.

00:24:36.727 --> 00:24:39.682
So He is the one who is,

00:24:39.882 --> 00:24:43.335
we can call, Dhanvantari - is a doctor.

00:24:45.757 --> 00:24:48.640
Also, He is Yama.

00:24:50.384 --> 00:24:56.965
Yama means the one who is responsible for our death.

00:24:58.453 --> 00:25:01.544
Of course, the Shiva,

00:25:01.744 --> 00:25:07.755
the... we can call, the principle of existence...

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.069
spirit has to go first,

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.112
and then Yama comes to take charge of the body.

00:25:16.501 --> 00:25:19.916
It is He who decides:

00:25:20.779 --> 00:25:23.740
Where should you go? Should you hang in the limbo?

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:26.301
Or should we send to the hell?

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:29.238
Or if you can go to heaven?

00:25:29.675 --> 00:25:32.544
All decision is taken by Him,

00:25:33.178 --> 00:25:37.968
with the help of Mahavishnu - that is Christ.

00:25:39.978 --> 00:25:44.685
So His job is to come when there is a dead body lying,

00:25:44.896 --> 00:25:49.315
to take away the spirit, and judge the spirit

00:25:49.576 --> 00:25:52.605
and put it in its proper place.

00:25:53.737 --> 00:25:57.465
Now a person who is an adharmi, supposing...

00:25:58.509 --> 00:26:00.697
Such a person

00:26:01.583 --> 00:26:06.302
He takes him out and puts him into hell.

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:10.298
But before it is done, sometimes,

00:26:10.779 --> 00:26:13.577
these black magic people arrive,

00:26:13.777 --> 00:26:18.743
take away the skull of such a dead body -

00:26:18.943 --> 00:26:22.068
because when you are burned, the skull is still left -

00:26:22.446 --> 00:26:26.813
or the bones and try to control the spirit.

00:26:27.179 --> 00:26:30.873
Before Yama enters onto the scene.

00:26:31.716 --> 00:26:37.881
Thus, they utilize that person, his spirit,

00:26:38.392 --> 00:26:42.182
and manipulate it, and use it

00:26:42.417 --> 00:26:46.885
to harm others, or to entice other; they control them.

00:26:47.536 --> 00:26:49.949
So, this is the greatest adharma.

00:26:50.733 --> 00:26:56.721
This is the worst thing that one can do - is to take away the spirit

00:26:57.041 --> 00:27:03.840
and use it for mesmerism or enticing.

00:27:06.587 --> 00:27:11.058
But at the death of such a person, such a tantrika,

00:27:11.857 --> 00:27:15.497
Yama gives him most

00:27:15.961 --> 00:27:22.099
horrible death in the sense that the spirit doesn't go out easily.

00:27:22.576 --> 00:27:26.350
And such a person suffers,

00:27:26.589 --> 00:27:32.480
suffers and wants the release, but he cannot get a release,

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:38.050
and it's a very big ordeal for that person to die.

00:27:39.317 --> 00:27:49.805
It's a punishment of being such a horrible tantrika

00:27:50.005 --> 00:27:55.528
that you have tortured so many lives.

00:27:56.911 --> 00:28:03.065
So the idea of sin came through dharma and adharma.

00:28:04.825 --> 00:28:12.166
We have idea of sin which is very superficial sometimes.

00:28:14.994 --> 00:28:20.831
For example, when Arjuna was fighting in the war,

00:28:21.752 --> 00:28:25.754
He said, "How can I kill these people?

00:28:26.477 --> 00:28:28.971
They are my brothers, they are my sis...,

00:28:29.171 --> 00:28:33.693
my relations, uncles, how can I kill them?"

00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:37.152
Shri Krishna said, "They are already dead.

00:28:38.237 --> 00:28:40.281
You are not going to kill."

00:28:40.481 --> 00:28:42.481
So...how are they dead? -

00:28:43.522 --> 00:28:48.308
Because they are on the side of adharma. So they are already killed.

00:28:50.008 --> 00:28:55.855
But you are on the side of dharma, and if you fight for dharma,

00:28:56.122 --> 00:29:01.029
then even if you die, you will be saved.

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:07.259
Now this is stretched too far in many scriptures also

00:29:07.828 --> 00:29:09.697
Which is very absurd.

00:29:09.974 --> 00:29:12.178
Like saying that if you die,

00:29:12.378 --> 00:29:16.096
and bury yourself - it is no soul they talk of -

00:29:16.296 --> 00:29:19.799
bury your body, then from the body

00:29:19.999 --> 00:29:22.107
after five hundred years,

00:29:22.307 --> 00:29:25.788
your body will come out, and you will be saved.

00:29:26.801 --> 00:29:30.658
After five hundred years, what will remain of the body?

00:29:31.701 --> 00:29:36.189
Such absurd ideas there are in these three religions:

00:29:36.412 --> 00:29:41.525
Christian, Jews and Muslims.

00:29:41.817 --> 00:29:44.155
That's why they bury people.

00:29:44.442 --> 00:29:47.614
Now burying people means you are occupying the land,

00:29:48.157 --> 00:29:51.076
and also keeping the bhoots there.

00:29:51.276 --> 00:29:53.856
Like in... I was surprised,

00:29:54.056 --> 00:29:58.465
when I first came to Paris, that in the center of Paris

00:29:58.665 --> 00:30:02.227
they have got such a big cemetery.

00:30:03.137 --> 00:30:05.181
Naturally, people drink here -

00:30:05.391 --> 00:30:09.638
because most of the drunkards are sitting there inside the graves

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.578
and they are inciting them to drink.

00:30:14.267 --> 00:30:18.214
It's very surprising that in the West

00:30:28.617 --> 00:30:31.796
they have such absurd ideas

00:30:32.124 --> 00:30:37.348
that when you'll be buried, then you'll be resurrected like Christ.

00:30:37.711 --> 00:30:42.484
Just imagine... Christ was resurrected between three days.

00:30:43.181 --> 00:30:48.252
He died on Friday, resurrected on Sunday morning. Not even three days.

00:30:48.507 --> 00:30:51.991
But if you keep some body for five hundred years,

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:55.453
who is not even Christ, - if Christ's body, is different -

00:30:55.663 --> 00:30:59.748
what will come out of it? And so they are burying people.

00:31:00.647 --> 00:31:04.067
Only realised souls should be buried,

00:31:05.767 --> 00:31:08.346
not every common person.

00:31:09.058 --> 00:31:13.551
Because they still have their desires, their...

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:17.495
they still want some things, their souls might be

00:31:17.695 --> 00:31:21.754
hanging around there...you see...that body.

00:31:22.196 --> 00:31:30.519
So, why should you keep the body in a place for years together?

00:31:30.888 --> 00:31:35.947
Then, after sometime, they'll dig it up and make houses there.

00:31:36.816 --> 00:31:41.161
And all the bhoots must... coming in the house.

00:31:41.902 --> 00:31:45.296
So to understand dharma, we should also understand

00:31:45.569 --> 00:31:50.711
how we are going to deal with the death of general people

00:31:51.106 --> 00:31:53.906
and the death of Sahaja Yogis.

00:31:56.367 --> 00:31:59.668
Only if you are dharmic, it is not sufficient.

00:31:59.868 --> 00:32:02.814
There are many people who don't do anything wrong,

00:32:03.014 --> 00:32:05.750
they're very austere type, something,

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:10.847
but they are not in balance, normally. They're very hot tempered.

00:32:11.151 --> 00:32:14.971
If they are not hot tempered, they're absolutely recluses,

00:32:15.171 --> 00:32:18.335
sit in the Himalayas, like that.

00:32:18.756 --> 00:32:23.362
But those people who are dharmic - in the real sense of the word -

00:32:24.355 --> 00:32:29.612
once they ascend to the state of Virat,

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:34.376
then only they are the people

00:32:34.654 --> 00:32:38.549
who should be preserved, their body should be preserved.

00:32:38.784 --> 00:32:45.784
Because the dharma from the nabhi goes to your brain,

00:32:46.797 --> 00:32:53.679
and brain supplies to all the nerves the energy of the spirit.

00:32:54.854 --> 00:33:01.854
So the whole body of a realized soul is full of vibratory awareness.

00:33:02.937 --> 00:33:10.452
If such a body is buried, you can even get fragrance.

00:33:11.529 --> 00:33:19.053
And from a distance you will know that there is some saint being buried here.

00:33:20.739 --> 00:33:24.144
If you remember, there are seven photographs of Mine,

00:33:24.344 --> 00:33:26.614
where the light is falling on Me.

00:33:26.912 --> 00:33:29.497
That was a village called Mian ki takli.

00:33:29.759 --> 00:33:33.291
They told me then, "Mianh, one Sufi saint,

00:33:33.491 --> 00:33:36.227
died in this place. So He is buried here."

00:33:36.942 --> 00:33:39.931
Immediately, I felt the vibrations.

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:44.477
And when I was sitting on the dais,

00:33:45.034 --> 00:33:50.751
I saw Him in the
form of light, and

00:33:51.038 --> 00:33:53.915
He started throwing light on Me.

00:33:54.163 --> 00:33:57.528
And I was very happy; but when I stopped, He stopped it.

00:34:01.225 --> 00:34:04.860
He didn't become a bhoot. No, He did not.

00:34:05.063 --> 00:34:07.203
He became the light.

00:34:07.403 --> 00:34:12.916
And wherever it was necessary, He showed His presence.

00:34:14.249 --> 00:34:16.911
So, we are following some dharmas.

00:34:17.111 --> 00:34:22.909
In Sahaja Yoga you are supposed to follow Vishnu principle.

00:34:23.729 --> 00:34:26.365
You have to follow Vishnu principle.

00:34:26.565 --> 00:34:31.767
You cannot say that, "Mother, we cannot do it."

00:34:31.967 --> 00:34:36.047
For example, Vishnu doesn't like smoking.

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:39.745
Tobacco, He doesn't like.

00:34:40.109 --> 00:34:42.878
He doesn't like alcohol.

00:34:43.501 --> 00:34:49.502
He doesn't like these drugs. He hates drugs.

00:34:50.039 --> 00:34:54.687
He doesn't like many medicines that human beings are producing.

00:34:55.334 --> 00:34:59.921
For example these antibiotics, if a
Sahaja Yogi takes, he'll vomit -

00:35:00.732 --> 00:35:02.929
If he's a real Sahaja Yogi.

00:35:03.882 --> 00:35:07.584
Whatever maybe the quantity, whatever maybe the quality,

00:35:07.784 --> 00:35:12.286
so many medicines he cannot take.

00:35:14.036 --> 00:35:17.751
So, automatically you become like a Brahmin who avoids:

00:35:17.951 --> 00:35:20.282
"No, no, not this."

00:35:20.482 --> 00:35:24.062
Then you won't go and have food in a place

00:35:24.637 --> 00:35:29.140
where there are people who are against Sahaja Yoga,

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:32.789
or who are not dharmic at all. You won't like it.

00:35:33.647 --> 00:35:35.469
I don't have to tell you

00:35:35.712 --> 00:35:40.287
that don't look at the women - you won't. You won't look at, automatically.

00:35:40.722 --> 00:35:44.140
Your eyes, out of dharma, will become steady.

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:47.447
Nor will I have to tell women that they shouldn't run after men.

00:35:47.647 --> 00:35:52.050
Very few are like that who are struggling still.

00:35:52.272 --> 00:35:55.635
But most of you just drop all these bad habits,

00:35:55.866 --> 00:35:59.200
and come to a state where

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:03.158
you just automatically become dharmic.

00:36:03.913 --> 00:36:06.948
Because when the Kundalini rises

00:36:07.746 --> 00:36:14.122
and occupies your brain,

00:36:15.398 --> 00:36:19.932
then you understand what is right, what is wrong;

00:36:20.625 --> 00:36:26.201
through your vibrations you will not take something that is not good.

00:36:26.887 --> 00:36:30.389
Food, you will see vibrations is not good, you will not eat.

00:36:31.393 --> 00:36:34.917
Anything that is not suitable, you will just say, 'No.'

00:36:35.117 --> 00:36:39.019
I don't have to tell you: "Don't do this, don't do that."

00:36:39.244 --> 00:36:41.262
You will never kill anyone;

00:36:41.462 --> 00:36:45.030
you will never commit any sin, automatically.

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:47.989
I don't have to tell you: "Don't do this,

00:36:48.204 --> 00:36:50.497
don't commit this sin, don't commit that sin."

00:36:50.732 --> 00:36:53.688
Of course, if you are not yet a matured Sahaja Yogi

00:36:53.888 --> 00:36:57.704
then maybe. But with maturity,

00:36:58.532 --> 00:37:02.934
I don't think you will take to wrong things. And you'll enjoy your virtues.

00:37:03.745 --> 00:37:08.263
The things that are called are virtues, are Vishnu principles.

00:37:09.664 --> 00:37:13.554
You say: "This man is virtuous," is very limited.

00:37:13.754 --> 00:37:17.679
In the mundane language 'he his virtuous' maybe:

00:37:17.879 --> 00:37:21.423
he is good at drawings or something;

00:37:22.862 --> 00:37:25.022
nothing more than that.

00:37:25.222 --> 00:37:29.195
But, if you say: "Virtuous",

00:37:29.414 --> 00:37:32.444
it means he's a Sahaja Yogi.

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:40.079
Now, Christ has gone so far, that if somebody slaps you

00:37:40.279 --> 00:37:43.771
on your left cheek, you turn the right to that person.

00:37:44.511 --> 00:37:47.765
Now think of it: How subtle He's gone -

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:54.363
- In patience and tolerance. Now think of the Christian Nations,

00:37:54.785 --> 00:37:58.786
which went all around the world and plundered.

00:37:59.282 --> 00:38:03.412
Spanish went to America, killed all these people there;

00:38:03.679 --> 00:38:06.895
English came to India, killed so many people there.

00:38:07.158 --> 00:38:13.435
Then some French also went to various African countries and finished them off.

00:38:14.429 --> 00:38:16.988
These are supposed to be Christians?

00:38:17.188 --> 00:38:20.977
By what means are they Christians?

00:38:24.536 --> 00:38:30.332
Not only that you have to ...not to aggress, that's not the only point.

00:38:30.532 --> 00:38:33.048
If somebody aggresses you,

00:38:33.248 --> 00:38:36.729
then you turn your another cheek to that person.

00:38:37.863 --> 00:38:40.238
This was said by Christ.

00:38:40.496 --> 00:38:43.940
Every ten.... every commandment

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:48.950
He has tried to bring down to the level of Sahaja Yogis.

00:38:50.157 --> 00:38:55.231
How the beauty of Sahaja Yoga will shine through you.

00:38:55.864 --> 00:38:58.889
And how you will express your spirit -

00:38:59.232 --> 00:39:02.150
it is in the Matthews, I think second chapter.

00:39:02.473 --> 00:39:05.679
Where "the blessed are" written down, after that.

00:39:07.252 --> 00:39:11.374
It's clearly written down what you should be.

00:39:11.735 --> 00:39:17.199
How tolerant, how patient, how compassionate, how loving.

00:39:17.399 --> 00:39:24.027
It is remarkable how such a great incarnation

00:39:24.621 --> 00:39:31.223
of Lord Jesus Christ was brought to such a low level by Christians.

00:39:31.607 --> 00:39:34.409
They have no business to call them Christians.

00:39:34.609 --> 00:39:37.503
They are the greatest heathens I could think of.

00:39:37.703 --> 00:39:41.551
The way they have ruined their culture, everything.

00:39:43.706 --> 00:39:47.889
What about Islam? Islam...

00:39:50.737 --> 00:39:53.892
as in the Bible, Paul has
done all the mischief

00:39:54.092 --> 00:39:56.648
- I don't know, he must
be another rakshasa.

00:39:56.887 --> 00:40:00.720
Islam, also Koran was written by a very horrible fellow.

00:40:01.072 --> 00:40:06.198
Mohammed Sahib never knew how to read and write. And there was one fellow

00:40:06.398 --> 00:40:10.926
called as Mohayya.

00:40:11.254 --> 00:40:12.895
He was such a horrible fellow;

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:15.869
he authorized Bible [could Shri Mataji mean Koran?], just like Paul.

00:40:16.266 --> 00:40:21.614
In that he put this Shariat. Now Shariat was meant for...

00:40:22.172 --> 00:40:25.157
for irmaia what you say in English? -

00:40:25.411 --> 00:40:32.660
- Jeremiah. In Jeremiah... Jeremiah has written that when Moses came

00:40:34.829 --> 00:40:37.927
Adi Guru - He came

00:40:38.703 --> 00:40:41.095
with the message of ten commandments

00:40:41.295 --> 00:40:45.025
from the hill of Tur - He found these Jews

00:40:45.225 --> 00:40:50.330
going into complete decadent society, which we see today around ourselves.

00:40:50.679 --> 00:40:53.412
And He was so angry,

00:40:53.612 --> 00:40:58.578
that He said that: "For you, these are the punishments."

00:40:58.778 --> 00:41:05.778
But this was Moses, gave to Jews, at that time. Not for today.

00:41:06.797 --> 00:41:11.440
But the Muslims are using that left and right among themselves.

00:41:11.937 --> 00:41:14.661
And they have become so quarrelsome

00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:17.208
that they are fighting among themselves,

00:41:17.416 --> 00:41:19.950
and I think they'll kill each other and finish off.

00:41:21.586 --> 00:41:24.574
There is no dharma of love;

00:41:24.774 --> 00:41:29.657
there is no dharma of compassion.

00:41:32.465 --> 00:41:37.878
The one who is not a Muslim is to be killed somehow,

00:41:38.152 --> 00:41:41.606
and the one who is a Muslim is also killed,

00:41:41.827 --> 00:41:47.057
because any Muslim cannot change his religion, he cannot.

00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:50.699
If he is a Muslim, he's a Muslim. He has to die as a Muslim.

00:41:50.899 --> 00:41:54.839
If he tries to If he tries to  do anything else, he'll be killed.

00:41:55.596 --> 00:42:01.173
If he runs away from the Islam, he'll be killed. It's a prison.

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:05.497
It's a prison, and in that prison, one has to live.

00:42:05.697 --> 00:42:09.243
You are not to question anything; you are not to ask for anything.

00:42:09.749 --> 00:42:12.798
The other day I was watching the Hajj,

00:42:13.049 --> 00:42:17.595
and there was one fellow from Sudan.

00:42:17.992 --> 00:42:21.161
He was really like Hitler, talking like Hitler,

00:42:21.361 --> 00:42:25.945
and I asked someone to translate it - the Arabic.

00:42:26.145 --> 00:42:29.218
And he was just pouring poison.

00:42:29.432 --> 00:42:33.526
He was calling everyone as heathens:

00:42:33.726 --> 00:42:37.523
"They have no truth with them, we have the truth."

00:42:37.753 --> 00:42:40.703
What sort of a truth you have?

00:42:40.921 --> 00:42:45.492
What are you... what good are you doing anywhere? What truth you have got?

00:42:46.311 --> 00:42:50.228
And he said all these nonsensical things that 'we should kill all those

00:42:50.428 --> 00:42:52.428
who don't have the truth,' this, that

00:42:55.259 --> 00:42:57.345
And I was looking at it.

00:42:58.702 --> 00:43:01.276
And a question came to Me -

00:43:01.482 --> 00:43:03.491
he is saying all these things in My presence,

00:43:03.691 --> 00:43:06.592
I don't know what's going to happen to all these people.

00:43:06.968 --> 00:43:12.000
And second day, there was a stampede of thirty thousand people,

00:43:12.275 --> 00:43:15.578
who had gone for Hajj.

00:43:20.032 --> 00:43:23.243
So these stupid people in charge of religion

00:43:23.392 --> 00:43:26.192
will kill all the Muslims this how,

00:43:26.303 --> 00:43:30.133
finish them off, and think that we have achieved a lot.

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:38.161
Then, about the Jews:

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:42.276
Jews have been waiting for a savior and all that.

00:43:42.412 --> 00:43:48.206
And they didn't like Christ. But they didn't kill Christ, I must say.

00:43:48.681 --> 00:43:54.223
They didn't kill; this was the idea of Paul, to put it.

00:43:55.183 --> 00:44:00.127
But the Jews never realized what the dharma is.

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:04.650
Because Moses just gave them such a horrible Shariat.

00:44:05.414 --> 00:44:06.871
They never realized.

00:44:07.022 --> 00:44:10.135
So they shut the Shariat - 'All right. Nothing doing. We will not have.'

00:44:10.748 --> 00:44:14.558
And they became extremely money oriented.

00:44:14.919 --> 00:44:18.203
Miserly money oriented.

00:44:18.941 --> 00:44:21.663
They lend money to somebody;

00:44:21.894 --> 00:44:25.526
that fellow goes on paying the interest, interest, interest.

00:44:25.746 --> 00:44:31.241
Then he cannot pay, so they'll confiscate his house, sell it out.

00:44:32.104 --> 00:44:36.372
They became very, very, very, very cruel people,

00:44:36.604 --> 00:44:42.235
and also licentious, very cruel. So, one rakshasa

00:44:42.548 --> 00:44:47.944
called Freud was born in their society. Freud was a Jew.

00:44:49.702 --> 00:44:54.516
And people... you see, he understood what is the weaknesses of human beings are,

00:44:54.865 --> 00:44:58.898
and he was accepted in that stupid America, very much.

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:05.517
So much so, that they lost all sense of dharma.

00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:12.397
When he said all these nonsensical things about the mother,

00:45:12.647 --> 00:45:15.633
how could there be any dharma?

00:45:17.935 --> 00:45:21.976
Now they are writing, 'Downfall of

00:45:22.141 --> 00:45:27.394
Freudian empire, fraudulent Freud,' and now there are so many books coming.

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:34.305
As a result of this, what has happened is,

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:37.827
because you were not so traditionally bound,

00:45:38.106 --> 00:45:41.491
and this kind of stupid religions came in the West,

00:45:44.139 --> 00:45:47.496
through these destructive people,

00:45:52.051 --> 00:45:56.617
you lost faith. Lost complete faith -

00:45:56.953 --> 00:46:00.826
'it's alright, go to Church, come back home, what is there?'

00:46:00.867 --> 00:46:02.620
Is talking like that...

00:46:02.792 --> 00:46:08.019
The priests, the mullahs, and all these leading such a horrible life.

00:46:08.225 --> 00:46:11.027
Completely, people lost faith.

00:46:11.187 --> 00:46:16.741
And when they lost the faith, they lost their personality.

00:46:17.927 --> 00:46:22.503
They lost the personality, and I am surprised

00:46:22.738 --> 00:46:26.477
how people follow fashions,

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:29.492
as I told the other day.

00:46:29.687 --> 00:46:31.551
They followed fashions.

00:46:31.739 --> 00:46:35.691
Anybody says: "You should have skinhead", they'll cut off their hair.

00:46:35.961 --> 00:46:39.801
Tomorrow somebody says: "You cut your nose", they'll all cut their noses.

00:46:41.325 --> 00:46:44.337
"You dress up like this",

00:46:44.513 --> 00:46:49.221
they will dress up like that. Said: "Torn clothes ", all right, torn clothes...

00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:57.370
One person starts it, that is the entrepreneur, and everybody follows.

00:47:01.318 --> 00:47:06.536
Traditionally, if you had found out that this dress suits you,

00:47:06.764 --> 00:47:09.486
should have kept to it. But these entrepreneurs,

00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:11.998
whatever they tell you, you take it up.

00:47:12.242 --> 00:47:17.638
As if you have no brains. As if you have no capacity to understand.

00:47:19.241 --> 00:47:23.091
But for a dharmic person, he'll say: "Get lost."

00:47:24.029 --> 00:47:28.684
He won't, he won't change. 'Why should I waste my money?

00:47:29.778 --> 00:47:32.858
Accumulate all these nonsensical things?'

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:38.079
So, when I started Sahaja Yoga,

00:47:38.344 --> 00:47:41.078
I was reluctant, but I told everyone

00:47:41.224 --> 00:47:44.622
that you better put some oil in your head.

00:47:46.805 --> 00:47:48.455
You can wash it next day,

00:47:48.675 --> 00:47:52.249
but in the night put some oil. Otherwise, after sometime

00:47:52.304 --> 00:47:56.623
I'll see all men baldheaded and women wearing wigs.

00:47:58.133 --> 00:48:01.732
I am a Mother, so I am going to tell you the truth.

00:48:03.077 --> 00:48:05.831
With great difficulties, Sahaja Yogis agreed.

00:48:05.906 --> 00:48:08.814
I said: "You can wash it next day."

00:48:10.368 --> 00:48:14.774
It is necessary for you to have, is a simple thing like that,

00:48:15.403 --> 00:48:19.305
because the hair grow on oil.

00:48:19.943 --> 00:48:24.100
Is a very simple thing - I told them that you do like that.

00:48:24.333 --> 00:48:28.824
And they would not agree. They would not change it.

00:48:29.504 --> 00:48:33.046
But thank God, now, some sense has come.

00:48:33.171 --> 00:48:35.319
And they are doing few things,

00:48:35.553 --> 00:48:39.180
very few things have to be done, for SahajaYogis,

00:48:39.327 --> 00:48:45.349
to get alright in their health, and also in their wealth.

00:48:45.165 --> 00:48:48.836
They don't have to do much because they are standing in dharma.

00:48:49.281 --> 00:48:53.621
And they are in the Kingdom of God.

00:48:54.313 --> 00:48:58.881
They are under the protection of Virat.

00:48:59.736 --> 00:49:05.214
But still, there are certain things you have to do, certain things.

00:49:07.996 --> 00:49:10.681
I didn't say that: "Don't smoke."

00:49:10.894 --> 00:49:16.767
You just gave up yourself. The alcohol, all these things you gave up yourself -

00:49:16.945 --> 00:49:20.708
because you have the light. And despite the fact

00:49:20.962 --> 00:49:24.198
that you come from a culture where there is no personality,

00:49:24.375 --> 00:49:28.393
people are like sheep, now you are not.

00:49:29.128 --> 00:49:31.797
Now you are individualistic.

00:49:32.928 --> 00:49:36.079
To be individual is impossible in the West.

00:49:36.329 --> 00:49:39.881
Because you must dress up the way everybody dresses up.

00:49:40.255 --> 00:49:43.913
If they are punks, you'll all move like punks;

00:49:44.486 --> 00:49:49.065
if the one woman has this kind of hair, you make the same style.

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:51.943
Specially on the hair, I don't know why.

00:49:52.142 --> 00:49:58.122
Maybe it is the power of Virat. It acts mostly on hair.

00:49:58.701 --> 00:50:02.984
Then the clothes and everything... you have realized

00:50:03.428 --> 00:50:08.781
that chastity is a part of dharma. Is not only women,

00:50:09.276 --> 00:50:13.847
it's not the chastity of women, but the chastity of men and women

00:50:14.084 --> 00:50:17.114
is their power, is Ganesha's power.

00:50:17.923 --> 00:50:23.009
This is the dharma, which you have accepted. I never told you anything,

00:50:23.268 --> 00:50:27.897
but you have accepted. And you have imbibed, and you are enjoying it.

00:50:29.809 --> 00:50:33.224
Now if they accept us as dharma, what is so special?

00:50:33.406 --> 00:50:35.833
We are the only dharma.

00:50:36.056 --> 00:50:39.381
The rest are all adharmis. They call themselves dharmic;

00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:42.086
they have no dharma in them.

00:50:43.924 --> 00:50:46.490
Unless and until you have dharm by which

00:50:46.704 --> 00:50:49.976
you get a balance, wisdom, you cannot ascend.

00:50:50.169 --> 00:50:53.018
But if you ascend even without dharma,

00:50:53.207 --> 00:50:55.461
Sahaja Yoga is so great, I've seen,

00:50:55.622 --> 00:50:59.560
people who were quiet adharmic and all that just got realization.

00:51:00.273 --> 00:51:04.718
If you ascend, then dharma trickles down; they become dharmic.

00:51:07.968 --> 00:51:10.316
So many try to write to me

00:51:10.583 --> 00:51:12.735
about their past, I just tear it off, finished.

00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:14.395
Now you have become lotuses,

00:51:14.648 --> 00:51:18.160
why are you telling me about something I am not interested in?

00:51:19.343 --> 00:51:21.470
So, once you get your realization,

00:51:21.676 --> 00:51:24.220
this is the best way, and I just thought of this.

00:51:24.444 --> 00:51:27.590
Specially when I saw the situation

00:51:27.813 --> 00:51:31.557
in the world that was coming in this Kali Yuga, I thought, in this chaos,

00:51:31.769 --> 00:51:37.191
'Unless and until you raise their Kundalini, dharma cannot be established.'

00:51:37.914 --> 00:51:40.493
This... If I have done anything, I have done this.

00:51:40.662 --> 00:51:42.845
Is to find out the method "en masse",

00:51:42.998 --> 00:51:45.572
giving realization and the problem will be solved.

00:51:45.788 --> 00:51:47.843
You don't have to tell them anything,

00:51:48.032 --> 00:51:52.315
'don't do, don't do,' nothing. Just they'll do it.

00:51:55.453 --> 00:52:00.715
It was successful, I must say, very successful.

00:52:01.346 --> 00:52:07.111
Among you, I find my vision being established.

00:52:08.259 --> 00:52:13.014
Whatever concern I had, whatever worry I had about this Paris

00:52:13.263 --> 00:52:16.352
is over now, finished.

00:52:16.893 --> 00:52:20.119
I used to come three times in a year.

00:52:20.309 --> 00:52:24.244
And everybody would say: "Mother what is this? Why do you oblige them so much?"

00:52:24.458 --> 00:52:27.881
So I said that: "This is the gate of hell let me go."

00:52:28.194 --> 00:52:31.644
And now this has become the gate of heaven.

00:52:43.703 --> 00:52:45.969
So, for us not difficult

00:52:46.286 --> 00:52:49.423
to establish Vishnu principle within us -

00:52:49.608 --> 00:52:52.569
But to recognize that we have those.

00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:56.544
You see, suddenly I find Sahaja Yogis become extremely humble.

00:52:56.607 --> 00:52:59.050
And they don't want to know what they have.

00:52:59.171 --> 00:53:02.605
You can cure people; you are a Dhanvantari.

00:53:03.244 --> 00:53:05.419
You can give realization to people.

00:53:05.574 --> 00:53:10.019
All Vishnu principles are now awakened within you,

00:53:10.122 --> 00:53:11.942
and you must utilize it.

00:53:12.088 --> 00:53:14.321
I wish we had Vishnu

00:53:14.553 --> 00:53:16.241
[Shri Mataji asks someone there (in Marathi)

00:53:16.449 --> 00:53:20.455
if they had Vishnu Sahastranama  - the 1000 names of Shri Vishnu]

00:53:20.631 --> 00:53:24.745
Now there are thousand names, which I would not like you to say,

00:53:24.962 --> 00:53:28.594
but at least some names of Vishnu if you can say,

00:53:28.711 --> 00:53:34.745
you will understand how this Vishnu
principle is awakened in you.

00:53:34.899 --> 00:53:37.275
To such an extent

00:53:38.576 --> 00:53:42.875
that somebody said: "Mother, no, I don't
want to work in the public."

00:53:43.035 --> 00:53:44.435
I said: "Why?"

00:53:44.590 --> 00:53:47.583
"I don't want to have that ego back in me."

00:53:47.695 --> 00:53:50.046
They are so sweet.

00:53:50.213 --> 00:53:52.656
They're afraid of their ego being coming.

00:53:52.814 --> 00:53:57.441
No, no, no, no... It won't come back now, because here sits

00:53:57.603 --> 00:54:02.552
the Vishnu as Virat. He'll look after you,

00:54:03.075 --> 00:54:08.492
and you have that Vishnupad in yourself.

00:54:14.572 --> 00:54:17.012
So much could be said about it.

00:54:17.184 --> 00:54:21.162
But I think you should read even thousand names of Vishnu

00:54:25.392 --> 00:54:30.444
and you will know how many qualities you can have.

00:54:32.749 --> 00:54:35.247
May God bless you.
