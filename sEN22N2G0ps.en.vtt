00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:12.720
Today, we are going to worship Shri Krishna.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.850
See how cold it was about three o'clock.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:29.840
Now the reason is this, that Shri Krishna
did little mischief with Indra.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:39.799
Indra, who is a God, or you can call semi-God,
for looking after the rain.

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:45.280
So, Indra got very angry.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:57.689
You see all such semi-Gods are very sensitive
people, at the smallest thing they get angry

00:00:57.689 --> 00:01:07.730
and irritated and they start using their powers
to express their anger.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:19.850
So he started pouring rain on all the gopas
and Shri Krishna, who were looking after the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:27.560
cows.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:38.310
And the rain was so heavy that they thought
that the whole land will be completely submerged.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:02:09.880
So Indra was very happy to spoil the game
of Shri Krishna, and he thought he was very

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.810
successful.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:29.810
So, Shri Krishna lifted a mountain on His
finger, and all these people who were getting

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.290
drowned, went under that mountain.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:41.170
This is Shri Krishna's style.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.030
My style is different.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.600
I told Indra that you can't misbehave with
me, you can't.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:02.400
So far I'm not harmed you in any way and
I'm not irritated you.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:11.640
Of course it's going to be Shri Krishna's
Puja, but that doesn't mean that you should

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.820
try to show off your powers before me.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:26.020
Sometimes I wonder these Devas - Semi-Gods,
they are realized souls or not, because why

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:32.020
do they get angry like this for small things.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:42.860
Whatever it is, he could be reconciled and
now it's become warm, I must say.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:59.480
With Sahaja Yoga you can do many many things,
but you must know what you can do.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:13.280
For that, Krishna is a very good example.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.679
He started Sahaj culture.

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:27.930
Culture, I'm saying - He didn't give realization
to anyone, but He gave the idea of Sahaj culture.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.020
How?

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:44.880
- Before him came Shri Ram, who was Maryada
Purushotama, who was a man very particular

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.960
about everything.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:57.800
I mean, like He threw out His wife because
He was a king and a king cannot have a scandal,

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.609
especially from His wife.

00:05:00.609 --> 00:05:07.990
So He threw Her out - it was not Kali Yuga,
that's why.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:21.340
And His father ordered him to go, not only
His father so much as His stepmother, to go

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.999
in an exile into a forest.

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:34.330
So He agreed, after all He was Maryada Purushotama.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:42.810
So whatever His father said, He agreed, whatever
His mother said, He agreed, and went into

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:49.030
the forest, stayed there fourteen years.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:54.000
This is the obedience to the father.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.279
There was no need, His father was not God.

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:13.279
He was God, but in those days it was important
to make people, not only respect the parents

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:21.669
but also to obey them, that was the time.

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:33.810
In His time there were many munis, and many
saints and many also hatha yogis.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:46.539
And these, even before him, used to make people
practice very strict type of discipline and

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:57.099
if they did not practice the discipline, they
had to do a lot of penance.

00:06:57.099 --> 00:07:05.979
And, so many people who tried also, never
reached the goal, because of the strictness

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:22.270
and complete discipline about following the
path of spirituality.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:26.330
Recently I was reading a book called "Peaceful
Warrior".

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:35.930
There they have described an American seeking
the truth, and the guru of that fellow really

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:44.609
really takes him to such a horrible severe
task - that my granddaughter said, I am very

00:07:44.609 --> 00:07:48.979
angry with such a Guru, she couldn't bear
it.

00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:57.370
So ultimately he finds that he is the existence.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:03.620
So that was the practice followed after Shri
Rama.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:14.210
People would leave their wives, children,
go to Himalayas and sit there and practice

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:17.180
meditation.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:34.170
It was a very rigorously followed, or I should
say, a very moral society - so very moral.

00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:45.820
But it was out of fear, the whole morality
came through fear, which is also repeated

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:46.820
in other religions.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:53.570
Now I would say that Islam today, has taken
that form, it is the fear.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:59.780
They are not doing it out of freedom.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:08.300
Also Christians, same thing, and Hindus - I
don't know - halfway this side, and half way

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:14.770
that side.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:21.030
Even among Sikhs there's terrible disciplining.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:28.100
So much so that, as punishment you have to
clean the shoes of all the people.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.850
I don't know if it is to beat yourself with
shoes or another.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:38.660
But quite a lot of punishment is there.

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:52.730
Then came Shri Krishna and He saw the situation
- that the way people are really now fasting.

00:09:52.730 --> 00:10:04.910
If you really go through the rituals of Hindu
religion, out of one week, you will be fasting

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.960
for six days at least.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:16.720
One day you might eat some sort of a food,
then you'll have to visit all kinds of places.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:26.730
Now, recently they had to go, as you know,
to Amarnath, and so many died there.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:34.930
So now they said "we have got Nirvana, we
died while doing this, so we have got Nirvana".

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:41.860
This kind of a very funny idea was existing.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:50.380
That we have Nirvana now, we have achieved
whatever we wanted and now we are dead, so

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:55.240
many are dead, so those who were not dead
were repenting why they were not dead - it

00:10:55.240 --> 00:11:01.070
would have been much better, they would have
got their Nirvana.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:12.390
So, even in this Kali Yuga these ideas are
prevalent.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:21.290
Even in India, people have very severe types,
especially in south I have seen, they do all

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:31.700
kinds of nonsense for the atonement or maybe
for something they are asking.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:37.570
All this nonsense was too much for Shri Krishna.

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:44.820
He couldn't understand that they are going
to destroy their lives with this kind of ritualistic

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:51.700
gruelling, then what will remain out of them
for Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.450
So He's the one who started Sahaj culture.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:12:10.000
He said "let us enjoy, we must have enjoyment,
Nirmala Anand - pure joy".

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.810
How do we have pure joy by?

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:25.690
- He had this rakhi bandhan by which, apart
from your wife, everybody is your sister or

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:26.690
mother.

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:29.790
I must say it is quite true about Indians.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:35.560
Not in the north so much because of Islamic
influence, but in the south it is so.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:39.740
In Maharastra it is so.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:51.320
And then He started also this Holi, in which
you should play with colors, maybe to get

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.780
rid of the color barriers we have, maybe.

00:12:54.780 --> 00:13:02.110
In America it is a very good idea to play
with colors and put some black on the whites

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:09.310
and some whites on the black and they can
see for themselves how stupid it is to fight

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:17.210
in the name of color.

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:28.850
He used to play with children who were looking
after cows, just like a very ordinary person.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:33.390
He never tried to show off His powers.

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:43.390
He never tried to stand out, never would dress
up in a very special way, never.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:49.210
Just like an out ordinary cowherd.

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:56.600
And His relationship with His mother, Yeshoda
- she was not His mother - was also extremely

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.530
beautiful.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:08.160
There are so many beautiful poems written
about His childhood.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:15.740
That, He's the one who is in charge of the
whole universe.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:26.030
As a little boy used to put His finger into
His mouth wondering - how can a Divine Virata

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:34.940
do that?

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.290
What is His thinking like a child?

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.410
All His actions of children.

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:43.230
Yesterday's song, as you heard it, is this.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:47.690
All these little, little actions are described
very well.

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:52.260
Especially by another very great poet, Surdas,
who was blind.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:15:01.780
His childhood is described in a very beautiful
manner and the description of His relationship

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:08.650
with His mother is very natural and very sweet.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:13.730
It was not like this, as modern times, a carpet
is spoiled, "Oh, the carpet you have spoiled

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:18.350
it, I'll hit you hard, this carpet you have
spoiled".

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:25.420
They have more interest in their things than
in their own children.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:33.220
But according to our culture, if the child
breaks anything, you have to say this "very

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.280
good you have broken, some badha has gone
away".

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:45.820
Never to scold a child for doing anything
which you think is destructive - because then

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:50.290
he will definitely become destructive.

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:55.530
So to understand a child, I think you must
read those poems, beautiful poems, which are

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:59.560
written about Shri Krishna.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:10.630
I don't know how their imagination reached
that beautiful height of pure joy.

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:22.380
So towards our children also, we have to be
extremely sweet and nice and forgiving.

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:29.810
But some children, of course, I meet are difficult,
but they also can be corrected if you really

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:33.210
apply Shri Krishna's methods to him.

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:45.910
Now when He went to college, or we can say
in to the school of a Sandipanimuni, the guru.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:51.340
The guru's wife was very kind.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:56.100
But the guru was strict.

00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:06.440
And his wife used to look after him and when
she gave him something for food when they

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:13.600
would go and bring some woods from the forest.

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:18.810
It is very subtle, you know the whole thing
is.

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:27.090
He went there and His friend was carrying
the food.

00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:34.290
His friend was carrying the food and Shri
Krishna was busy cutting the wood, imagine?

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:41.880
Shri Krishna was cutting the wood for the
mother.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:48.120
I mean, for the mother He could do anything,
He was God.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:58.160
So no work for the mother was menial or lower.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:09.850
But the other fellow, the friend of His, he
was very hungry, so he ate all the food and

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:12.580
nothing was left.

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:17.900
So when he came down, he got very much worried.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:25.930
He went and told his guru that "I ate all
the food and I didn't share it with Shri Krishna".

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:36.800
The guru got very angry, very angry and he
said "now, you will be cursed with permanent

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:37.800
poverty".

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:49.970
But the mother said "no, not permanent - till
you meet Shri Krishna again".

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:58.100
That's how she tried to give, we call it Upashad,
in that you give another curse, which can

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:02.090
neutralize partly.

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:11.860
The same friend, was Sudama, and he was very
very poor.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:21.930
Now see the Sahaj ways of Shri Krishna, He
always used to remember Sudama and He told

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:29.430
His wife that I really I don't know, he's
cursed, I don't know what must be his condition,

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:30.870
where he must be?

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:41.110
Now the friendship - He was a king, such intimacy
of feeling with a friend.

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:44.590
He said "I used to go with him, I used to
collect the woods.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:50.470
I mean, imagine all these little, little things
had such a big importance for him.

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:57.560
So, He was not only worried about the whole
world, as He should have been, but also about

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:00.860
Sudama - When will I meet him?

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.790
When will I see him again?

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:08.649
Where must be his house?

00:20:08.649 --> 00:20:10.170
How he must be living?

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:20.240
All these very delicate feelings He had for
His friend.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:25.550
Just like a Sahaja Yogi.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:35.960
In the Sahaja style, we worry about the whole
world and also individually we are worried.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:47.790
We come to know about one person who has fallen
sick, who has a problem, something is serious.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:21:00.060
All the Sahaja Yogis think of him and are
worried about him, they may have everything,

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:06.060
but still they are worried, what is happening
to such and such person.

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:16.870
How many of us know each other's names - I
mean He knows everybody's name - practically.

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:29.770
And how we care for them, how we respect them,
how we love them and how we have pure relationships.

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:38.800
Today is also the day of Rakshabandhan, which
is a very great thing that we should have

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:42.310
pure relationships.

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:53.880
I've seen in, say Maharashtra, men won't go
and talk to women much and women won't go

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:57.890
and talk to men.

00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:07.810
And once, somebody remarked - "Then what are
you women doing, talking to women only?".

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:10.980
So, I said what are we to talk to you?

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:15.890
You are talking about your office, we are
talking about our houses and homes.

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:19.910
What is there to talk to you?

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:25.930
The western culture is different, they will
force you.

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:30.680
They'll make one man sit here and next to
him should be a woman, somebody else's wife,

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.700
then another man and then somebody else's
wife.

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:40.650
How can you have intimacy?

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:51.690
This kind of idea, which is A-Sahaj, has slipped
into immorality.

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:57.700
There's no need for men and women to sit like
that, what is the need, I just don't understand.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.260
Compulsorily you have to sit.

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:12.060
I've had a bad time, I tell you, with my husband's
job, I never liked it.

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:16.890
What is there to talk to these men, after
all, I don't know anything about banking,

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:22.100
I don't know shares, I don't know stock exchange,
what it is.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:27.970
Or I don't know profits, and this and that
- that part is zero.

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:36.080
Then, I don't know about office, I don't know
many other things men talk about, so what

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:42.029
is there to talk to them - it is so very difficult.

00:23:42.029 --> 00:23:49.340
And whenever I said something, I really dropped
a brick.

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:58.320
Once in a party, they were offering drinks
to everyone and this, so I said "I will have

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:02.520
a soft drink".

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.130
So the valet came and gave me a soft drink.

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:14.230
The valet was having a bow, and a white shirt,
that's all, absolutely A-Sahaj methods.

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:24.100
Black bow, white shirt, black coat, black
pant, all just the same - whether it is an

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.860
ambassador or a valet.

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:29.830
You can't make it out who is who.

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:53.110
So I drank, you know, and when it was finished
I gave it to an ambassador, a very well known

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:54.110
ambassador.

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:59.300
To me there was no difference at all, when
they are just say walking the same way, talking

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.130
the same way.

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:08.010
So A-Sahaj the whole thing is.

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:16.440
They say they have so many Embassies, for
what I don't know and there what they have,

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:20.950
always drinks, parties - shake hands, shake
hands.

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:25.950
Your hands will break, I tell you.

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:29.220
Most A-Sahaj method is to shake hands.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:35.340
Why not say Namaste, it is better, and you
know me.

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:39.060
Sometimes I used to get such heat.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:43.730
Like yesterday you have shown that the ice
melted.

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:47.590
The same thing used to happen to me.

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:52.790
Mostly they were very hot people and I didn't
know what to do, I used to stand on one side

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:54.930
just feeling shy.

00:25:54.930 --> 00:26:01.030
But this method of hand shaking is absolutely
A-Sahaj.

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:11.470
And worse than that is French method, is to
kiss, and like it or not - you are kissed.

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:13.670
Or to hug somebody.

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:26.230
The first time I gave realization to one English
gentleman, he just lifted me up like that.

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:39.850
I said " all right - it's just out of joy
he has done it, it's all right".

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:46.290
But there is no openness, there's no openness
of heart.

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:52.260
You go to a party, you have to be dressed
up like this only, if you are not dressed

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.540
up like that, then you are useless.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:59.640
If you go for a death also.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:04.330
Somebody died, a great friend, a nice man.

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:07.340
So I was told I had to wear a black sari.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:12.590
Black blouse, everything black.

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:17.840
I said, "I have no sari, black without border,
you know".

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:21.529
So they said "you don't go".

00:27:21.529 --> 00:27:24.990
I said "Very good idea".

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:28.600
Because I don't know these A-Sahaj methods.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:37.130
You are not supposed to cry or weep there,
no, you have to keep quiet.

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:46.180
Then when you go there, the body is lying
there, and after a prayer is said, you are

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:48.560
supposed to drink champagne.

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:59.000
I mean, imagine it, how can you, no feelings,
for that body which is lying there dead.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.710
And everybody very happy, and if somebody
looked unhappy, they would ask "what's wrong,

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:08.580
are you all right?".

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:11.970
No consciousness that we have lost a friend
here.

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:19.510
This is the A-Sahaj style when it comes to
grief.

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:35.090
When it comes to joy it is A-Sahaj, when it
comes to grief it is A-Sahaj.

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:46.590
We have to be Sahaj, in the sense that whatever
we do, we do it spontaneously.

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:48.940
Not with deliberations.

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:53.890
We have some very anglicized people in India
also.

00:28:53.890 --> 00:29:05.529
And the lady of the house died
and I went to see - and in India the body

00:29:05.529 --> 00:29:10.170
is taken down on the ground.

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:17.090
So they were discussing what to do, what time
to start the funeral and all that.

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:23.550
So one lady, who is a very well known person
in India, she said "you should not do it before

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:25.320
twelve o'clock".

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.560
I said "why"?

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.790
She said, "Because I'll have to wear white".

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:30.500
"That's true".

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:36.780
"And I'll have to go to the bank to get my
diamonds to match with the white sari".

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:42.010
I said "What is this?"

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:52.690
Such filth of materialism.

00:29:52.690 --> 00:30:03.529
It is going too far, we are going away from
our feelings, from our emotions, which are

00:30:03.529 --> 00:30:12.460
genuine, which are there all the time, you
don't have to think about them, they exist

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:15.560
all the time.

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:20.820
But you think "Now, should I cry or not?

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:24.290
Should I laugh or not?

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:28.320
It's so spontaneous.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:33.620
If you have joy, you are spontaneous.

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:39.310
You express your joy spontaneously.

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:50.260
Of course, not in an uncultured way, but in
a very cultured way.

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:58.560
Now, what 's the meaning of the Sahaj culture
- this culture, is something that is, you

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:09.960
are groomed, you are brought up, in a very
natural manner, that you develop a culture.

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:23.210
A small, like, a child like, simple innocent
behavior.

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:42.050
It is Shri Krishna's introduction of idea
of pure joy - Nirmala Anand, which came as

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:53.080
a great relief to Indian people because they
were following Shri Ramachandra.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:57.840
But then abandonment started.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:11.330
The problem is, if you make them strict, they
become like starched clothes I think, that

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:16.820
you can't wear them.

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:22.200
Or if you allow them - no, no, you must enjoy,
you must enjoy, all right, you allow them,

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:26.540
do what you like.

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:32.649
If you allow them to do what you like, then
they start doing all kinds of things.

00:32:32.649 --> 00:32:40.310
In India, we had lots of horrible things,
which I dare not even tell you - in the name

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:41.310
of enjoyment.

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:51.620
But Shri Krishna Himself has been very much
misrepresented by stupid people like Vidyapati.

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:59.269
He was a great poet and he used Krishna and
Radha as Romeo and Juliet.

00:32:59.269 --> 00:33:07.550
That's the greatest insult to the purity of
their relationship.

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:13.529
You must have seen many pictures like that,
in Kangra Shaili, and this shaili, and that

00:33:13.529 --> 00:33:14.529
shaili.

00:33:14.529 --> 00:33:21.600
It's all nonsense.

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:36.960
They could not show the reality of their relationship,
but some sort of a very vulgar expression.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:45.550
Because I think these poets and these artists
at that time had some hidden suppressed feelings

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:55.420
within themselves and they used Shri Krishna
for that.

00:33:55.420 --> 00:34:01.160
All kinds of romanticism is attached.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:06.540
Sometimes I feel that people have not understood
Shri Krishna.

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:12.420
But there's a nice story about Him.

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:25.149
That once, His wives, He had many wives, that
is also another controversial point.

00:34:25.149 --> 00:34:35.250
He had many wives, because these were sixteen
thousand powers of Shri Krishna, who had taken

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:44.030
birth and were captured by one king and kept
in the prison.

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:50.490
So He had to release them, they were released.

00:34:50.490 --> 00:34:58.150
Now how are they to live with Shri Krishna,
He was a young man - so He married all of

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:00.210
them.

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:04.280
That is the case of Mohammed Sahib also.

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:10.200
He married all sixteen of them, they were
his powers.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:18.930
For a young man to keep sixteen thousand women
like a harem, what people would have thought

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:21.430
of Him.

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:23.530
So He married all of them.

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:34.770
And another point about His life is, that
once these all these ladies, and He had also

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:35.920
five wives.

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:44.800
These five wives were the causal of the five
elements.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:51.990
So He had to go.

00:35:51.990 --> 00:36:00.220
Once, these ladies wanted to go to see one
great saint.

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:06.780
And the river, which was there, was all completely
flooded.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:13.700
So, they came to Shri Krishna and told Him
that "How are we to cross? - because this

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:16.820
is over flooded.

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:21.100
He said "That's very easy to cross that river.

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:28.640
This river is called as the Virgin River,
Nirmada, now they are having big fights over

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:31.950
it in India nowadays, a big politics.

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:45.319
So you go and tell her that "Oh River, if
Shri Krishna is a complete celibate personality,

00:36:45.319 --> 00:36:58.450
perfect brahmachari, if that is the truth,
you go down".

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:05.930
And the river went down - and they crossed
over.

00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:10.440
Then they went and worshipped the saint and
when they came back to the bank of the river

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:15.579
it was again very much flooded.

00:37:15.579 --> 00:37:18.210
So they went to that saint and asked him "Now,
how are we to go back?".

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:20.240
He said "How did you come?".

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:28.079
They said "this is what Shri Krishna asked
us to tell the river".

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:37.180
"Alright, you go and tell the river that this
saint has not eaten any food whatsoever, nothing",

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:46.050
while they saw him eating plates after plates,
if this is the truth, then you better recede.

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:53.760
So, they went down and told the river, and
the river went down.

00:37:53.760 --> 00:38:00.280
They were amazed that this man ate such a
lot of things and this river has gone down

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:03.380
thinking this is the truth.

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:12.940
That means -
what has been their character?.

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:14.910
They're abhogis.

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:29.100
They're abhogis means, they do not get, indulge
into it, they eat, all right, but they don't

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:36.140
care, they don't have that feeling of eating,
and feeling of enjoying the food, and nothing

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:39.370
of the kind, they are just eating.

00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:50.700
And this gentleman with seventeen, I should
say sixteen thousand and five wives, is called

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:55.340
as Brahmachari, because they are not involved.

00:38:55.340 --> 00:39:03.070
They are in Sar state.

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:11.120
With such a great immaculate personality like
Shri Krishna, the way they have created this

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:14.400
nonsense of romanticism.

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:29.210
For America, I think they have gone too far
with the freedom they have.

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:39.670
As people with Shri Krishna's blessings became
free from all the rules, regulations and got

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:40.700
abandoned.

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:50.550
But America has gone much worse and not only
that, but the films they are producing are

00:39:50.550 --> 00:40:00.690
very dangerous films and really damaging the
whole world.

00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:07.339
They don't know what sin they are committing,
for thousands and thousands of people in the

00:40:07.339 --> 00:40:19.670
world have taken to all kinds of very destructive
ugly ideas.

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:28.460
Freud, all right, he's ousted - finished,
he's done already a great harm.

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:40.839
But what about these films, they are now very
much impressing our Indian directors.

00:40:40.839 --> 00:40:46.430
I think all these directors are guiding Indians
to hell.

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:51.829
The whole thing is so absurd and so dirty.

00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:56.030
For an Indian mind it is really inconceivable.

00:40:56.030 --> 00:41:08.559
Even, I have seen Americans can't bear it,
it has gone that bad.

00:41:08.559 --> 00:41:15.120
Then other things have started with this freedom
that we have.

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:27.370
Imagine if Shri Krishna was here, He would
never have put any oil in His head, He would

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:32.240
have never combed His hair, as He must have
His [indistinct].

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:38.780
And He might have worn some mod dresses from
America.

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:43.819
Otherwise, you cannot exist.

00:41:43.819 --> 00:41:46.980
All the junk now has gone all over the world.

00:41:46.980 --> 00:42:00.700
Selling in Moscow, selling in all the developing
countries.

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:08.319
Only thing, when it was declared that they
have AIDS - people used to buy even second

00:42:08.319 --> 00:42:12.530
hand from the tourists - they threw away all
that.

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:20.030
They are carrying AIDS all over and drugs
all over.

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:25.270
It's a destructive force.

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:37.370
It's a destructive force, which is very active
in this Kali Yuga and so we have to have many

00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:43.140
Sahaja Yogis to fight this destructive force.

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:53.660
And when they are destructive they are not
hypocritical, that's they think is a very

00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:54.660
great quality.

00:42:54.660 --> 00:43:00.210
But at least with hypocracy you can save some
people but when it's just an open thing everybody

00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:05.010
starts doing that.

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:14.130
So when you think the time Shri Krishna lived
and the beautiful time they had, of such clean

00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:30.280
life and how He killed all these demons, is
something so beautiful, so energy giving.

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:37.640
But how many demons there are nowadays in
this world - is it one? is it two?, is it

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:38.640
ten?

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:44.559
One is finished, another comes up like a mushroom
that is finished, third one comes up like

00:43:44.559 --> 00:43:46.350
a mushroom.

00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:57.490
And the most fertile land is America.

00:43:57.490 --> 00:44:03.700
So you all have to pay attention to this land
of Shri Krishna.

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:13.440
Especially Shri Krishna should really start
using His Sudarshana Chakra, would be a good

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:15.660
idea.

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:16.660
The time has come.

00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:20.530
That's why I gave you the conch.

00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:26.370
To declare the time has come to clean this
America.

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:28.410
That is the thing we have to do.

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:38.290
Today when we worship Shri Krishna, you must
awaken within you yourself that consciousness,

00:44:38.290 --> 00:44:44.580
that now Shri Krishna is within all of you.

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:56.690
And by your communication, because He's collective,
by your speech, by your songs, by all that

00:44:56.690 --> 00:45:08.660
you use to communicate with others, should
carry the message of peace, of love, of compassion,

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:18.118
of truth and above all of Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:21.870
May God bless you
