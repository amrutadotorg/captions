00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Sashti. Sixth night of Navaratri, Sydney (Australia),
17 October 2007.

00:00:20.375 --> 00:00:26.208
This is too small.

00:00:53.083 --> 00:00:58.125
You can get a good hall here, very easily.

00:01:00.417 --> 00:01:07.333
Actually I never knew that there’s a programme

00:01:08.041 --> 00:01:11.041
otherwise I would have told you.

00:01:33.208 --> 00:01:35.166
Here also,

00:01:56.291 --> 00:02:00.250
come along, there is room here.

00:02:07.417 --> 00:02:12.083
Can you hear me there?

00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:51.041
Come forward,

00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:04.417
here put the piano that side in the corner?

00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:39.208
Why is she crying?

00:03:52.041 --> 00:03:54.250
What has she got, a cake?

00:04:30.417 --> 00:04:33.208
What is this?

00:04:34.166 --> 00:04:35.250
A gift, Shri Mataji

00:04:45.166 --> 00:04:48.166
Very beautiful, Who’s done it?

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.250
Yogi: Maria and Sue

00:04:53.333 --> 00:04:55.125
You did?

00:04:56.041 --> 00:04:58.333
Very good, very good

00:04:59.166 --> 00:05:01.333
absolutly good

00:05:07.208 --> 00:05:09.083
Everything.

00:05:14.291 --> 00:05:17.000
What’s her name?

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.333
Yogi: Sue Williams

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:37.166
Thank you very much, very beautifully done.

00:05:43.375 --> 00:05:46.166
You can’t move further?

00:06:01.083 --> 00:06:03.166
Who is the leader here

00:06:07.417 --> 00:06:09.333
He is the leader?

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:17.125
So why couldn’t you get a bigger place?

00:06:21.083 --> 00:06:24.083
Shri Mataji, we could find a bigger place

00:06:24.166 --> 00:06:27.250
but we did not want to have to transport you from here

00:06:27.333 --> 00:06:31.166
– less moving for you.
Your comfort is our only desire Shri Mataji,

00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:34.417
so yogis are happy, so long as you’re comfortable.

00:06:39.041 --> 00:06:41.250
You are all Sahaja Yogis,

00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:47.208
and there should not be controversy between you.

00:06:50.041 --> 00:06:55.333
You should all think of the same thing, isn’t it?

00:06:57.333 --> 00:07:01.291
I feel sorry so many standing outside.

00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:04.208
Come in, come in!

00:07:05.333 --> 00:07:08.333
Can you move the piano behind?

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.375
Can you all hear me?

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:05.291
Those Como people are here? Como?

00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:10.333
Sir CP: They are not here.

00:08:11.041 --> 00:08:12.250
They are not here?

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.333
Both of them are not ?

00:08:39.125 --> 00:08:44.041
Yogi: Giovanni and his wife are here.

00:08:45.041 --> 00:08:47.375
You are from Como?

00:08:48.041 --> 00:08:50.041
See! He could come!

00:09:12.417 --> 00:09:14.417
You can come here,

00:09:16.208 --> 00:09:20.250
there is space, make some space there.

00:09:31.083 --> 00:09:34.291
Why didn’t you get another hall?

00:09:35.291 --> 00:09:37.333
They are so many….

00:09:59.166 --> 00:10:02.125
I’m happy to see all of you here.

00:10:05.333 --> 00:10:07.417
May God bless you.

00:10:19.333 --> 00:10:22.291
Today in the shop there was a lady.

00:10:22.417 --> 00:10:28.041
She came and she wanted to have her realisation, and she got it.

00:10:30.125 --> 00:10:32.417
Got it very well.

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:35.375
See now it depends on…

00:10:36.125 --> 00:10:38.333
there are many who are searching.

00:10:39.208 --> 00:10:45.041
But you have to contact them, and bring them forward.

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:54.417
Now, I don’t know, if you want to take a hall,

00:10:55.208 --> 00:10:57.208
you have to pay for it.

00:10:59.333 --> 00:11:02.291
But was this just to save money?

00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:17.166
You are so many.

00:11:17.291 --> 00:11:21.041
And you can afford to have a hall,

00:11:21.208 --> 00:11:23.333
all of you sitting there,

00:11:23.417 --> 00:11:26.250
and I feeling comfortable.

00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:35.083
After all, you are all Sahaja Yogis,

00:11:35.417 --> 00:11:38.333
all brothers and sisters,

00:11:41.041 --> 00:11:45.083
and you don’t mind any inconvenience,

00:11:45.417 --> 00:11:50.250
but if we can make something convenient, we should do it.

00:12:01.208 --> 00:12:04.291
With so many you could have got a hall…

00:12:04.417 --> 00:12:08.250
Yogi: Shri Mataji we have one big hall, in a place called Balmoral,

00:12:08.333 --> 00:12:10.166
it’s about one hour’s drive from here

00:12:10.291 --> 00:12:12.333
and  everyone could fit inside the big hall.

00:12:12.417 --> 00:12:14.250
It’s a little distance from here, Shri Mataji,

00:12:14.333 --> 00:12:18.041
it’s about one hour’s drive. Everyone would fit there.

00:12:18.333 --> 00:12:22.041
Sir CP: It would require your travelling to that place.

00:12:22.125 --> 00:12:26.166
In order not to give you trouble to travel, they all came here —

00:12:27.041 --> 00:12:31.291
No-no, I have no trouble, I have come all the way from India!

00:12:43.291 --> 00:12:49.333
For My convenience you take no such a note.

00:12:51.125 --> 00:12:55.041
See, wherever you are, wherever you have the programme,

00:12:55.125 --> 00:12:56.291
I’ll go there.

00:12:57.417 --> 00:13:01.083
As long as possible I will definitely go.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:18.250
These days, life is much more comfortable

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:22.125
but when I was working in the villages

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:25.125
I used to go on the bullock cart.

00:13:26.041 --> 00:13:29.125
You’ve got photograph, you can see

00:13:30.125 --> 00:13:33.417
– on the bullock cart, to go for miles together.

00:13:36.291 --> 00:13:39.041
I knew I had to do all that.

00:13:39.166 --> 00:13:41.333
If I have to get Sahaja Yogis,

00:13:41.417 --> 00:13:44.083
I have to work that way.

00:13:45.125 --> 00:13:47.166
And I was quite prepared.

00:13:49.166 --> 00:13:55.041
I never felt any exhaustion with it, never.

00:13:56.041 --> 00:14:00.041
On the contrary, after I meet you all I feel so happy.

00:14:07.333 --> 00:14:11.125
Now, is there somebody who has problems?

00:14:19.125 --> 00:14:23.166
Anybody. Who has problems?

00:14:28.041 --> 00:14:31.333
Yogi: You’ve blessed us all. We’re all blessed to be Sahaja Yogis.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.125
We don’t have any problems Shri Mataji. We’re with you,

00:14:34.208 --> 00:14:36.083
there are no problems.

00:14:46.125 --> 00:14:47.291
What did she say?

00:14:59.417 --> 00:15:02.125
Yogini: Shri Mataji, I have a problem.

00:15:03.333 --> 00:15:09.000
Yogi: She said she has a problem. She has a problem, Shri Mataji.

00:15:09.083 --> 00:15:10.083
What is that?

00:15:10.208 --> 00:15:12.125
Yogi: What is your problem?

00:15:14.291 --> 00:15:17.333
Yogini: Alcohol is a big problem in my family.

00:15:19.166 --> 00:15:22.333
Yogi: She’s saying her family has a problem with alcohol.

00:15:29.083 --> 00:15:32.041
Family,what is the problem?

00:15:37.125 --> 00:15:39.333
They are not in Sahaja Yoga?

00:15:41.125 --> 00:15:42.166
Why not?

00:15:43.291 --> 00:15:45.125
You are the mother?

00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:51.083
How about the children?

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:52.417
Yogini: I have two children in –

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:57.041
The children are… are they Sahaja Yogis your children?

00:15:57.125 --> 00:15:58.250
Yogini: No the two older children, no

00:15:58.333 --> 00:16:01.041
How many children you have?

00:16:01.125 --> 00:16:02.166
Yogi: Four children, Shri Mataji.

00:16:02.333 --> 00:16:06.291
Shri Mataji: Four children.  They are not Sahaja Yogis?

00:16:09.458 --> 00:16:13.333
Yogi: Two young children in Sahaja Yoga and the two older ones are not in Sahaja Yoga,

00:16:13.458 --> 00:16:15.375
and the husband is not in Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:17.417 --> 00:16:19.333
Surprising.

00:16:25.333 --> 00:16:28.542
But here the family system is good compared to,

00:16:29.083 --> 00:16:31.333
say, in England,

00:16:32.542 --> 00:16:37.041
where the family breaks after some time.

00:16:37.458 --> 00:16:40.500
At least here, is much better.

00:16:56.166 --> 00:16:59.458
Yogi (American accent): Shri Mataji, we in America have a problem,

00:16:59.542 --> 00:17:03.166
that the seekers don’t stay in Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:03.333 --> 00:17:06.458
Yogi: The seekers take their realisation in America,

00:17:07.041 --> 00:17:10.458
and they don’t stay in Sahaja Yoga.  This is our problem.

00:17:12.083 --> 00:17:13.166
They don’t stay.

00:17:13.291 --> 00:17:14.417
Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:17:14.542 --> 00:17:15.542
Why?

00:17:16.083 --> 00:17:17.375
Yogi: I don’t know Shri Mataji.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:21.208
It’s not complete.

00:17:24.333 --> 00:17:28.166
If they have a complete realisation,

00:17:28.542 --> 00:17:31.083
they will have to come.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.458
They are not complete.

00:17:35.333 --> 00:17:37.417
Just half way.

00:17:41.458 --> 00:17:43.125
They drink?

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:44.041
Yogi: Yes Shri Mataji

00:17:44.125 --> 00:17:45.333
That’s the point.

00:17:47.417 --> 00:17:51.041
After coming to Sahaja Yoga you cannot drink.

00:17:52.166 --> 00:17:54.375
And that must be the reason

00:17:55.458 --> 00:17:57.542
they don’t want to come.

00:17:58.458 --> 00:18:00.542
But you give them bandhans.

00:18:01.333 --> 00:18:03.208
And beat them with shoes.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:10.542
Who are those…your mother, father?

00:18:11.083 --> 00:18:14.125
Yogi: My mother, my father, yes.  My good friends

00:18:15.333 --> 00:18:19.166
they take realisation but they don’t stay as Sahaja Yogis.

00:18:19.542 --> 00:18:22.458
Because they drink.
Yogi: Yes Shri Mataji.

00:18:25.333 --> 00:18:27.166
See now,

00:18:31.166 --> 00:18:37.083
all your countries have indulged into drinking.

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:42.417
All over Europe, you see, and it’s a little fight,

00:18:43.041 --> 00:18:46.083
because for them drinking is their life.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.041
And they can’t get out of it.

00:18:52.375 --> 00:18:57.250
But we have ways.  We have to give them bandhans.

00:19:01.458 --> 00:19:05.166
If you give them bandhans, all of you put together,

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:08.375
then they cannot run away.

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:12.417
Bandhan has to be given.

00:19:13.166 --> 00:19:16.208
All of you should give bandhan.

00:19:26.542 --> 00:19:29.500
That’s how they have worked out in India.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:35.542
And India is, you know how Sahaja Yoga is strong there.

00:19:36.458 --> 00:19:39.166
The reason is if they find

00:19:39.333 --> 00:19:43.458
parents are not coming, or maybe children are not coming or whatever it is,

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:50.333
they all work it out by giving them bandhans.

00:19:52.166 --> 00:19:59.041
But first thing, you should regularly come to SahajaYoga.

00:20:00.458 --> 00:20:02.333
Regularly.

00:20:03.291 --> 00:20:09.041
It is not half way, like today you come and then you don’t come.

00:20:10.291 --> 00:20:12.166
That’s not proper.

00:20:13.458 --> 00:20:15.709
That’s – you cannot progress.

00:20:19.208 --> 00:20:24.625
You have to come to the programmes, all of you, regularly.

00:20:25.625 --> 00:20:31.500
Because you know, realisation is not easy thing.

00:20:32.625 --> 00:20:34.709
Nobody had it before.

00:20:35.417 --> 00:20:37.709
Now you have got it.

00:20:38.417 --> 00:20:41.709
So you have to maintain it and keep it up.

00:20:42.625 --> 00:20:45.375
Once you start developing that,

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:50.333
the female (or family?) of the house also changes.

00:20:51.458 --> 00:20:58.333
Greatest problem of Europe is – real problem, that they drink.

00:20:59.625 --> 00:21:02.250
Drinking is the main problem.

00:21:03.083 --> 00:21:06.250
And that’s why they don’t want to come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:07.125 --> 00:21:11.125
But they can give their parents, but not Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:13.583 --> 00:21:15.542
This is the trouble with them.

00:21:19.375 --> 00:21:21.333
Parents can be given up,

00:21:22.041 --> 00:21:25.083
in case they do not take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:26.208 --> 00:21:28.500
You should show you don’t like it.

00:21:29.709 --> 00:21:32.333
Why don’t they want Sahaja Yoga?

00:21:38.208 --> 00:21:44.208
They drink.
Now this is the curse of Europe, that they all drink.

00:21:45.208 --> 00:21:50.667
And drinking is something very difficult.

00:21:51.083 --> 00:21:54.083
They can’t give it up, poor things, they are slaves.

00:21:55.041 --> 00:21:56.709
Slaves of drinking.

00:21:57.709 --> 00:22:01.709
So by your behaviour, and by your affection,

00:22:03.583 --> 00:22:06.417
I’m sure you can win them over.

00:22:07.333 --> 00:22:10.709
What’s the use – people who drink die so early.

00:22:11.417 --> 00:22:15.375
You must have heard that they die very fast.

00:22:16.667 --> 00:22:20.709
But despite that they don’t realise that one should not drink.

00:22:21.542 --> 00:22:26.458
Because it has become an open market now for people.

00:22:28.125 --> 00:22:31.500
This is the biggest problem of Europe.

00:22:32.375 --> 00:22:37.125
But do you know it is much worse in America.

00:22:39.667 --> 00:22:42.709
America’s problem is so funny,

00:22:44.125 --> 00:22:49.166
that people who do Sahaja Yoga

00:22:50.667 --> 00:22:53.291
cannot convince their parents.

00:22:54.458 --> 00:22:58.083
And they think they have freedom

00:22:58.333 --> 00:23:00.500
to do whatever they like.

00:23:02.041 --> 00:23:07.166
And some of the Sahaja Yogis have lost their parents at a very early age.

00:23:09.083 --> 00:23:10.458
Very early age.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:17.250
Also they have parents who had heart

00:23:18.041 --> 00:23:20.208
heart attacks.

00:23:20.709 --> 00:23:22.500
All kinds of attacks.

00:23:22.625 --> 00:23:26.125
Not only heart but any other disease they get.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.458
It’s very funny,

00:23:30.166 --> 00:23:35.500
which they don’t understand how important it is to get your Realisation.

00:23:37.667 --> 00:23:40.417
So you should try to talk to them,

00:23:40.709 --> 00:23:43.417
that “what is the aim of your life.”

00:23:44.625 --> 00:23:46.333
You must ask them.

00:23:46.709 --> 00:23:49.125
“What is the aim of your life?

00:23:49.709 --> 00:23:52.709
You want to die or you want to live?”

00:23:53.667 --> 00:23:55.375
First question.

00:23:56.417 --> 00:23:59.166
If they say they want to die, let them die.

00:23:59.458 --> 00:24:01.083
You should say, “should we

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:04.542
supply with some wines for you when you die?”

00:24:06.291 --> 00:24:08.041
Make fun of it.

00:24:10.542 --> 00:24:12.125
Make a fun.

00:24:13.166 --> 00:24:15.709
So they will realise that they are stupid,

00:24:16.125 --> 00:24:17.500
who are drinking,

00:24:17.709 --> 00:24:19.709
and they are slaves.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.583
Slaves of drinking.

00:24:24.166 --> 00:24:27.375
They are not drinking because they are free people.

00:24:29.709 --> 00:24:32.709
Because they drink, they die.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.542
And die very fast.

00:24:36.667 --> 00:24:40.125
The complication of the society is so much.

00:24:42.083 --> 00:24:44.667
That I have seen people who were rich,

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:47.333
who had nice children,

00:24:47.583 --> 00:24:51.417
but they have lost their parenthood.

00:24:52.166 --> 00:24:54.041
They have lost the children,

00:24:54.417 --> 00:24:57.375
and they have no money also.  They are on the street.

00:24:59.667 --> 00:25:04.291
Drinking is the best way to waste all your money.

00:25:07.625 --> 00:25:10.417
They think then when you say “don’t drink”,

00:25:10.583 --> 00:25:14.250
you are interested in their money, maybe.

00:25:14.667 --> 00:25:16.625
God knows what they think because

00:25:17.083 --> 00:25:21.250
I don’t understand the psychology of people who drink.

00:25:22.458 --> 00:25:28.000
There are some bhoots I think who give them ideas like this.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.333
And they cannot give up drinking.

00:25:32.667 --> 00:25:34.375
Very wrong.

00:25:36.208 --> 00:25:39.417
Where...  in what book,

00:25:40.208 --> 00:25:45.625
I mean like bible or any book is said, that drinking is good?

00:25:48.208 --> 00:25:50.083
Did Christ drink?

00:25:51.375 --> 00:25:55.083
They will follow Christianity.

00:25:57.375 --> 00:26:02.166
They will follow Christianity, and not follow Christ.

00:26:04.291 --> 00:26:06.000
It’s like that.

00:26:06.583 --> 00:26:08.542
Christ never drank.

00:26:08.709 --> 00:26:11.083
His parents didn’t drink.

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:15.083
Now what makes them think that they have a right to drink?

00:26:19.291 --> 00:26:21.417
Specially for Christians.

00:26:22.041 --> 00:26:27.041
Stupid they are if they think that drinking is their right.

00:26:28.542 --> 00:26:32.583
And then they have problems with drinking.

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.667
Perhaps you know what problems there are.

00:26:37.625 --> 00:26:42.250
You can find out what happens when people are drunk.

00:26:42.458 --> 00:26:46.166
What happens to them, where do they go,

00:26:47.041 --> 00:26:49.000
what is their position.

00:26:51.709 --> 00:26:54.166
You can find out their friends,

00:26:54.667 --> 00:26:57.583
where are they, what they are doing,

00:26:58.208 --> 00:27:00.125
how are they living?.

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:03.041
You’ll be amazed,

00:27:03.458 --> 00:27:06.458
that they are already on their way out.

00:27:10.375 --> 00:27:14.208
If you show your wisdom to them, with assertion,

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:19.458
they will be coming around.

00:27:20.083 --> 00:27:21.583
You have to tell them.

00:27:22.208 --> 00:27:24.583
There’s nothing to feel shy about it.

00:27:26.583 --> 00:27:30.083
You have to tell them what happens with drinking.

00:27:31.041 --> 00:27:33.333
What is so great about it?

00:27:36.709 --> 00:27:41.417
Europe problem is drinking – first.

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:46.375
The second problem is parenthood.

00:27:47.542 --> 00:27:51.709
Parents don’t understand the responsibility of their children,

00:27:53.458 --> 00:27:58.291
that all their lives they are going to be children of yours.

00:27:59.208 --> 00:28:01.375
And you have to look after them.

00:28:01.709 --> 00:28:05.125
There is no way of getting it out.

00:28:06.291 --> 00:28:09.166
First of all why should you have children?

00:28:10.041 --> 00:28:12.208
And if you have children,

00:28:12.583 --> 00:28:15.709
you have to jolly well look after them.

00:28:16.583 --> 00:28:21.542
But I have seen that in Europe people are really stupid.

00:28:23.375 --> 00:28:26.375
They don’t understand this simple fact,

00:28:27.333 --> 00:28:31.291
that if we cannot look after ourselves,

00:28:31.417 --> 00:28:34.125
who will look after our children?

00:28:36.542 --> 00:28:38.583
Very irresponsible.

00:28:39.709 --> 00:28:44.625
Also the society is such, that in the society also,

00:28:45.125 --> 00:28:49.583
they just believe in drinking.  All of them.

00:28:52.417 --> 00:28:56.000
Indians who do not drink in India,

00:28:56.333 --> 00:28:58.709
here they come and drink.

00:29:00.417 --> 00:29:05.125
When they come here, then they think it is something ideal,

00:29:05.625 --> 00:29:10.250
and they drink.  I have known many like that,

00:29:10.375 --> 00:29:14.041
who came abroad and started drinking.

00:29:15.542 --> 00:29:18.250
So this is the big problem.

00:29:19.166 --> 00:29:23.083
You should openly talk about it, to everyone.

00:29:24.375 --> 00:29:27.250
That what is drinking, is stupidity —

00:29:27.667 --> 00:29:33.542
to become stupid, by paying for it.

00:29:34.542 --> 00:29:39.709
You have to pay, and you have to become mad.

00:29:41.166 --> 00:29:45.250
Just imagine.  If you make fun of it,

00:29:46.083 --> 00:29:48.458
and if you can tell them the truth,

00:29:49.166 --> 00:29:52.417
I am sure they are all with the intelligence,

00:29:53.166 --> 00:29:57.458
they will understand. But you should all the time tell them.

00:30:03.291 --> 00:30:07.667
The third problem is that here it is,

00:30:08.083 --> 00:30:11.542
till you are an adult you are away and free.

00:30:13.542 --> 00:30:15.667
But I can’t understand –

00:30:16.125 --> 00:30:20.250
you are born from your parents

00:30:21.041 --> 00:30:27.500
and how do you become free after 18 years or whatever age it is.

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:29.625
How can that be?

00:30:32.583 --> 00:30:36.375
It’s like a tree producing fruits,

00:30:36.542 --> 00:30:39.667
and the people take away their fruits and eat it.

00:30:40.375 --> 00:30:44.709
We are not trees.  We are human beings.

00:30:46.083 --> 00:30:48.542
We can’t behave like trees,

00:30:49.709 --> 00:30:55.625
which do not show any interest in their children after

00:30:56.166 --> 00:31:00.333
certain cutting has happened.

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:04.583
But it’s very surprising.

00:31:05.125 --> 00:31:10.041
See, for us Indians it’s absolutely surprising,

00:31:10.291 --> 00:31:13.458
that they can forget about their own children?

00:31:14.166 --> 00:31:15.709
How can they do it?

00:31:17.583 --> 00:31:21.125
You have got writers who have written stories,

00:31:21.458 --> 00:31:24.458
and they have written so many things here,

00:31:24.625 --> 00:31:28.500
that how can parents be stupid like that?

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:34.417
Whatever may be – whatever may be your father or mother –

00:31:34.625 --> 00:31:41.041
they may be poor or rich, whatever it is – they are your parents!

00:31:41.375 --> 00:31:44.417
And parents are there to look after you.

00:31:45.625 --> 00:31:51.208
The stupid thing is that they make the child look after themselves.

00:31:52.333 --> 00:31:54.709
When he is eighteen years of old,

00:31:55.333 --> 00:31:59.417
he earns of his own, and the parents – “alright, go ahead.”

00:32:01.166 --> 00:32:03.709
They want to shirk all the responsibility.

00:32:04.709 --> 00:32:10.667
Never heard of such a thing.  This is a very recent fashion.

00:32:15.583 --> 00:32:18.250
When Abraham Lincoln was there,

00:32:18.583 --> 00:32:20.625
did it happen like that?

00:32:28.125 --> 00:32:30.458
Did it happen with Christ,

00:32:31.709 --> 00:32:33.542
that Mother gave him up

00:32:33.709 --> 00:32:37.458
and said “alright, go ahead and get yourself crucified”?

00:32:42.291 --> 00:32:45.500
How can parents behave like this?

00:32:46.291 --> 00:32:48.291
They have no heart?

00:32:50.625 --> 00:32:53.625
That they have no love for their own children?

00:32:57.458 --> 00:32:59.583
India may not be that rich,

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.041
but people are loving their children.

00:33:10.375 --> 00:33:14.667
Children also here do not listen to their parents,

00:33:15.458 --> 00:33:18.250
because parents don’t look after them.

00:33:19.041 --> 00:33:23.333
Can you imagine a society,

00:33:23.667 --> 00:33:26.542
religion, or whatever you may call —

00:33:27.125 --> 00:33:31.250
people have no connection with each other.

00:33:34.542 --> 00:33:37.333
But in Sahaja Yoga we are all connected.

00:33:38.125 --> 00:33:40.041
We are all one.

00:33:40.458 --> 00:33:43.500
And we want to be together

00:33:44.166 --> 00:33:49.041
with all our so-called differences.

00:33:50.291 --> 00:33:54.458
We are Indians, we are Africans,

00:33:55.375 --> 00:34:02.000
we are English, but we are all Sahaja Yogis.

00:34:03.041 --> 00:34:05.458
And this is what you have to tell them,

00:34:06.041 --> 00:34:08.500
that what kind of friends you have?

00:34:09.125 --> 00:34:12.417
They just come here for drinking and go away.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.458
They’ll not even stand by you.

00:34:16.208 --> 00:34:20.041
But our friends are our dear friends.

00:34:23.166 --> 00:34:27.625
Sahaja Yogis sometimes make mistakes, doesn’t matter.

00:34:28.291 --> 00:34:30.333
But they are Sahaja Yogis,

00:34:31.166 --> 00:34:34.041
and they are one, and they help each other.

00:34:35.166 --> 00:34:38.667
See how many countries have come together in Sahaja Yoga,

00:34:39.417 --> 00:34:42.500
and they have such friendship with each other,

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:46.208
that you may not have with the people who are born

00:34:46.667 --> 00:34:50.166
on the same side of the Earth.

00:34:52.083 --> 00:34:54.667
You won’t recognize each other.

00:34:55.583 --> 00:34:57.542
It’s horrible.

00:34:58.125 --> 00:35:02.333
I tell you I am sometimes surprised the way

00:35:02.458 --> 00:35:05.458
parents don’t think much of their parents.

00:35:06.667 --> 00:35:11.041
Parents do not think that they are parents,

00:35:11.333 --> 00:35:14.583
and the children don’t think that we are

00:35:16.542 --> 00:35:19.542
children of these parents.

00:35:21.208 --> 00:35:23.500
I don’t know what has done that.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.542
It’s the money as they say, it’s the money,

00:35:27.208 --> 00:35:29.458
money they earn.  Alright,

00:35:29.667 --> 00:35:31.709
so what do you do with that money,

00:35:32.083 --> 00:35:36.000
make yourself miserable, and make everyone miserable?

00:35:38.041 --> 00:35:41.125
You don’t even respect money, because when you drink,

00:35:41.291 --> 00:35:43.208
how much money you waste?

00:35:45.291 --> 00:35:48.458
Does it go for any help?

00:35:50.375 --> 00:35:53.417
Then drinking, it’s – here,

00:35:54.041 --> 00:35:56.291
I was surprised,

00:35:58.208 --> 00:36:03.291
many have given up, luckily have given up, and are happy.

00:36:04.542 --> 00:36:08.166
It’s one thing, that in Europe,

00:36:09.333 --> 00:36:12.500
drinking is a big social event

00:36:13.458 --> 00:36:16.083
and everybody thinks they must drink,

00:36:16.375 --> 00:36:19.458
otherwise they are not human beings.

00:36:20.417 --> 00:36:25.166
They have to become mad, otherwise they are not.

00:36:26.542 --> 00:36:32.166
Now the parents will understand if you join together.

00:36:32.709 --> 00:36:37.125
You can bring them round, there are people who have done like that.

00:36:38.291 --> 00:36:42.333
All the Sahaja Yogis together have managed to

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:46.333
bring the whole Johnnies to Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:49.709 --> 00:36:52.417
When they will see that you are happy,

00:36:52.625 --> 00:36:56.375
you don’t tell lies, and you are honest,

00:36:56.542 --> 00:37:02.000
and you are humble — what more do you want?

00:37:06.041 --> 00:37:08.125
But they will go to church,

00:37:08.375 --> 00:37:12.333
call themselves Christians, and behave like Satan.

00:37:15.542 --> 00:37:17.291
See their behaviour.

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:19.709
They don’t even care for their children

00:37:20.125 --> 00:37:22.667
because they have certain habits they have developed.

00:37:23.458 --> 00:37:26.208
“Why can’t you give up those bad habits?”

00:37:27.208 --> 00:37:31.291
this is the point you should ask your parents.

00:37:31.709 --> 00:37:35.375
“Why don’t you give up this dirty stuff

00:37:36.375 --> 00:37:39.083
which is just making you mad?”

00:37:42.583 --> 00:37:45.709
Drinking makes people mad, I tell you,

00:37:46.166 --> 00:37:48.709
and all their value system is lost.

00:37:49.458 --> 00:37:55.375
Whatever you may be, whatever your education,

00:37:56.083 --> 00:38:00.333
all is useless if you take to drinks.

00:38:03.709 --> 00:38:06.500
You have no personality after that.

00:38:07.291 --> 00:38:11.709
Nothing [unclear] …the way you behave,

00:38:13.041 --> 00:38:15.583
and when people get drunk, do you see

00:38:16.041 --> 00:38:19.417
how they behave in a funny manner.

00:38:23.208 --> 00:38:25.458
So just detest it,

00:38:26.291 --> 00:38:29.375
and tell your parents you don’t like drinking.

00:38:30.083 --> 00:38:33.417
We don’t want you to drink, why do you drink?

00:38:36.583 --> 00:38:40.709
You can tell them!  Why do you drink?

00:38:42.125 --> 00:38:45.000
Because by drinking they become mad …

00:38:47.166 --> 00:38:51.667
it is better to get a certificate from mad house.

00:38:57.625 --> 00:39:02.041
You Sahaja Yogis now realize this is madness,

00:39:02.333 --> 00:39:04.166
and you have to tell them

00:39:04.583 --> 00:39:09.083
that we think that you are all mad who sit down and drink.

00:39:13.208 --> 00:39:15.375
What do you want?

00:39:16.542 --> 00:39:19.250
Drinking, what does it give you?

00:39:25.125 --> 00:39:29.083
First of all you must seek peace of your mind.

00:39:30.542 --> 00:39:33.166
That’s not possible if you drink,

00:39:33.417 --> 00:39:38.583
have you heard of somebody who has peace of mind because they drink?

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.083
When he dies, maybe!

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:52.667
So it is to be told to them frankly,

00:39:54.208 --> 00:39:58.500
why do you drink, what is the need, to waste all the money?,

00:40:03.667 --> 00:40:07.375
Mostly I have seen that they drink because they are so ignorant,

00:40:09.083 --> 00:40:13.542
that they don’t know there is a higher life and better life

00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:18.667
by which you can control your body, control everything.

00:40:21.625 --> 00:40:25.542
Once they come to know they will realize

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.625
that this drinking makes you a slave,

00:40:29.458 --> 00:40:32.125
they are slaves you see,

00:40:32.625 --> 00:40:34.709
and when they tell you something you should say

00:40:35.125 --> 00:40:39.709
‘we don’t want to listen to slaves, you are all slaves’

00:40:40.709 --> 00:40:43.417
there’s no harm in telling like this.

00:40:44.583 --> 00:40:48.375
‘You are slaves and we don’t want to listen to slaves’.

00:40:52.375 --> 00:40:57.083
You see in India I don’t know somehow we have solved the problem,

00:40:58.041 --> 00:41:00.166
people don’t drink so much,

00:41:00.583 --> 00:41:03.083
because from the very beginning

00:41:03.333 --> 00:41:07.125
there the drinking is regarded as a very bad thing.

00:41:08.083 --> 00:41:12.291
If a girl knows that the fellow drinks she will never marry.

00:41:13.667 --> 00:41:21.500
So society doesn’t accept drinking is a good thing,

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:26.583
while your  society is no society

00:41:27.458 --> 00:41:31.458
because there is no friendship,

00:41:31.709 --> 00:41:34.125
there is no understanding

00:41:34.291 --> 00:41:39.083
and they don’t think of improving the life.

00:41:42.041 --> 00:41:45.583
What do they think? They are very selfish

00:41:46.125 --> 00:41:48.417
and they think of themselves,

00:41:48.709 --> 00:41:53.542
selfishness in the sense  that becoming mad

00:41:53.709 --> 00:41:56.250
is very great selfishness.

00:41:58.709 --> 00:42:01.041
They become mad,

00:42:01.542 --> 00:42:05.291
and go on becoming more mad and more mad

00:42:05.458 --> 00:42:07.542
and it is a sickness,

00:42:09.291 --> 00:42:12.208
you should tell them that this is sickness.

00:42:12.709 --> 00:42:17.417
‘You are sick people already and we don’t want to follow you’ .

00:42:19.458 --> 00:42:22.375
Don’t be rude but you should tell them.

00:42:23.166 --> 00:42:27.208
Drinking is sickness, you say I said it.

00:42:29.667 --> 00:42:31.291
I don’t mind .

00:42:36.709 --> 00:42:40.417
Have you seen a man who is drunk?

00:42:41.458 --> 00:42:43.583
What do you think of them?

00:42:44.542 --> 00:42:47.333
They are more than mad people.

00:42:49.166 --> 00:42:52.500
People are mad because something gone wrong.

00:42:53.375 --> 00:42:57.375
But these are mad because they have been drinking,

00:43:00.041 --> 00:43:03.083
so you have to tell them ‘You are all mad.

00:43:03.458 --> 00:43:06.125
You are going to ruin your country’

00:43:08.291 --> 00:43:12.458
So many things I have seen, what happens in the West,

00:43:13.542 --> 00:43:18.500
my own experience. See I am working in Maharastra,

00:43:18.667 --> 00:43:23.083
working in India in different places

00:43:24.542 --> 00:43:28.417
but there is no problem

00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:33.208
with them when they are realised souls,

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:38.041
but here with realised souls also I find problems.

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:44.291
There is no problem in India if there is realised souls,

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:47.375
they are purely  realised,

00:43:47.709 --> 00:43:51.583
and here  there are problems

00:43:52.417 --> 00:43:56.583
even with the realised people.

00:44:00.542 --> 00:44:06.333
Here there are some Sahaja Yogis who made illegal money.

00:44:08.417 --> 00:44:11.291
They are Sahaja Yogis, I know for definite,

00:44:11.583 --> 00:44:13.667
but they have done like that,

00:44:17.375 --> 00:44:24.667
they have been saved, but not in the Heaven.

00:44:28.083 --> 00:44:35.625
They work it out, save themselves but everything happens.

00:44:37.542 --> 00:44:41.500
Some people say ‘Mother we drink very little’ but why?

00:44:44.041 --> 00:44:48.583
Very common –‘very little we drink’

00:44:49.041 --> 00:44:53.083
but why? Why do you want to drink and waste your money,

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:56.291
first of all wasting your money.

00:45:03.041 --> 00:45:04.625
It’s very sad,

00:45:05.583 --> 00:45:09.542
that all people who are so well educated,

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:14.250
so well off, become so mad

00:45:15.583 --> 00:45:17.250
Idon’t understand

00:45:18.333 --> 00:45:22.166
And if your parents are drinking they are mad.

00:45:24.083 --> 00:45:27.125
You have to treat them like mad people.

00:45:28.542 --> 00:45:31.083
Then they will realize,

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:35.667
you should tell them off,

00:45:37.208 --> 00:45:41.250
that you want to waste all your money in drinking.

00:45:42.583 --> 00:45:47.417
In India we have that way very strong Sahaja Yogis.

00:45:48.542 --> 00:45:53.375
They break the bottles if they come in the house…

00:45:54.333 --> 00:46:02.291
or what they do they break the….anything!

00:46:08.417 --> 00:46:11.625
The parents become really funny

00:46:12.041 --> 00:46:16.208
because they can’t understand what is happening to these children.

00:46:16.667 --> 00:46:19.125
But they are Sahaja Yogis,

00:46:19.542 --> 00:46:23.125
so they don’t like it and they just throw them out.

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:30.333
There is no humbleness needed with the mad people.

00:46:31.208 --> 00:46:34.542
You have to see that they give up their drinking,

00:46:35.333 --> 00:46:41.542
very important, and not to feel shy about it.

00:46:44.625 --> 00:46:50.125
If you correct your parents you correct the whole nation.

00:46:54.583 --> 00:47:00.333
So you all have to work it out and discuss among yourselves

00:47:01.417 --> 00:47:04.625
and tell ‘Oh my Father drinks a lot’

00:47:05.375 --> 00:47:09.208
So you ask your friend to come and put him right.

00:47:09.458 --> 00:47:12.500
You can make fun of them, they are mad!

00:47:15.333 --> 00:47:20.709
Do not take them seriously, they are mad, have pity on them,

00:47:22.291 --> 00:47:27.542
and work it out that way. You have so many friends together.

00:47:28.542 --> 00:47:31.375
Drinking is the curse in the West,

00:47:33.208 --> 00:47:38.375
and how it has come I think some satanic force has worked,

00:47:39.667 --> 00:47:42.625
they never used to drink so much before.

00:47:43.625 --> 00:47:48.375
No! Now I don’t know,

00:47:49.417 --> 00:47:55.458
you walk on the street and you find so many of them walking along.

00:47:59.333 --> 00:48:03.667
So Sahaja Yogis should see that they don’t drink themselves

00:48:04.166 --> 00:48:07.709
and don’t allow anybody to drink,

00:48:08.208 --> 00:48:11.417
your father, mother, brother…

00:48:13.041 --> 00:48:15.625
you have to tell them ‘You are all mad!

00:48:18.208 --> 00:48:20.291
Go to some mad house’

00:48:21.458 --> 00:48:25.083
Once you tell them they will realize,

00:48:27.333 --> 00:48:30.208
it’s only you who can correct them.

00:48:31.542 --> 00:48:33.250
I may do anything

00:48:33.458 --> 00:48:37.375
but first of all these people should give up drinking?

00:48:39.709 --> 00:48:42.709
You have lot of strength as Sahaja Yogis

00:48:43.291 --> 00:48:46.458
and you have to work out on your parents.

00:48:48.166 --> 00:48:52.166
How many of your parents are drinking?
Raise your hands….

00:48:56.125 --> 00:48:57.500
Your parents also?

00:48:58.542 --> 00:49:02.291
Bah prai!  [unclear]

00:49:06.166 --> 00:49:07.667
Just imagine.

00:49:10.709 --> 00:49:16.667
You should all oppose their drinking, openly.

00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:24.583
You should say I don’t like to talk to people whodrink.

00:49:25.166 --> 00:49:30.250
Like that.  You go on and you’ll be surprised they’ll come round.

00:49:35.333 --> 00:49:41.417
It is absolutely depending on you.

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:47.709
If your parents are drinking you have to take a very strong view.

00:49:48.333 --> 00:49:51.625
And you have so many other friends, also, to help you.

00:49:53.583 --> 00:49:56.041
Make fun of them.

00:49:56.500 --> 00:50:02.208
Somebody should copy as to how they behave after drinking,

00:50:02.417 --> 00:50:04.542
how they walk.

00:50:05.709 --> 00:50:09.709
You should not insult them but to copy them.

00:50:12.083 --> 00:50:15.208
Once they will know there is no respect

00:50:16.125 --> 00:50:19.625
and care for the parents they’ll be alright.

00:50:23.542 --> 00:50:30.125
But even if they drink you are not so much bothered –

00:50:31.709 --> 00:50:35.166
you are not bothered as to — if they are drinking,

00:50:36.208 --> 00:50:40.291
but you should say that you are all  mad, where will you be going?

00:50:41.417 --> 00:50:44.208
What will happen to you?

00:50:49.291 --> 00:50:52.667
You can talk like elderly people with them

00:50:56.500 --> 00:51:00.500
and also see that they don’t have friends who drink,

00:51:02.041 --> 00:51:05.500
if they have friends like that you’d better tell the friends.

00:51:13.583 --> 00:51:15.250
You see

00:51:15.542 --> 00:51:20.291
it’s not only you get responsibility when you get your realization

00:51:20.458 --> 00:51:25.125
but it is your absolute  responsibility

00:51:25.333 --> 00:51:31.500
that you improve your parents and improve your brothers and sisters,

00:51:38.625 --> 00:51:41.500
you have to boss over them

00:51:42.542 --> 00:51:47.500
and you have to tell them, nothing to feel shy.

00:51:49.375 --> 00:51:51.625
Because they are mad, you know!

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.667
Very important forSahaja Yogis.

00:52:05.291 --> 00:52:11.458
My experience is this, that there are Sahaja Yogis

00:52:12.166 --> 00:52:18.208
in the West who are born, who get realization,

00:52:18.583 --> 00:52:22.625
who are very good, who are excellent, I don’t have to say anything.

00:52:24.208 --> 00:52:28.542
But they are humble before their parents.

00:52:31.333 --> 00:52:34.333
You try to show that you don’t like it.

00:52:36.125 --> 00:52:41.500
If they are drinking don’t sit there, get out of that place.

00:52:43.041 --> 00:52:45.500
You should try to denounce the whole thing.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.500
There’s no harm.

00:52:52.291 --> 00:52:57.083
If somebody says harsh words you fight it back.

00:52:57.542 --> 00:53:02.583
But what about all these drunkards who are sitting and drinking?

00:53:03.208 --> 00:53:05.458
You have to tell them all.

00:53:06.583 --> 00:53:10.041
It’s only you who can improve your society.

00:53:12.250 --> 00:53:15.583
I’m here to tell you,

00:53:23.583 --> 00:53:27.250
but you people are very subdued .

00:53:29.458 --> 00:53:34.250
How many of you fight with the parents, tell me, raise your hands.

00:53:37.333 --> 00:53:39.083
Hardly any.

00:53:47.333 --> 00:53:50.417
You are afraid of them, these drunkards?

00:53:57.375 --> 00:53:59.500
They should be afraid of you

00:54:01.291 --> 00:54:03.542
and hide themselves somewhere.

00:54:07.291 --> 00:54:10.250
If there are bottles in the house you break them.

00:54:12.333 --> 00:54:14.041
Of course!

00:54:14.625 --> 00:54:17.375
You throw them away, break them.

00:54:18.208 --> 00:54:21.125
That’s how you have to fight them.

00:54:25.458 --> 00:54:30.041
How did we manage the British to go away from India?

00:54:33.709 --> 00:54:36.375
By protesting!

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:48.208
By protesting their domination, that’s all! Simple!

00:54:51.458 --> 00:54:53.542
And they went away.

00:54:54.375 --> 00:54:57.375
Can you imagine, there was no war, nothing,

00:54:57.583 --> 00:54:59.375
and they all left us.

00:55:06.667 --> 00:55:09.625
Because they say it is cold that’s why we drink.

00:55:10.208 --> 00:55:15.417
No need, there is no need to drink for that.

00:55:18.291 --> 00:55:23.166
I know so many Indians, so many of them,

00:55:24.542 --> 00:55:32.125
they don’t drink, they have never seen such a cold country.

00:55:33.583 --> 00:55:36.709
Now also many Russians they don’t drink.

00:55:38.083 --> 00:55:40.208
Very cold country, Russians,

00:55:40.542 --> 00:55:44.625
and they don’t allow their parents also to drink, you know Russians.

00:55:46.125 --> 00:55:50.166
They are very brave, the way they fought.

00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:54.417
You know how Hitler was trying to dominate them

00:55:55.250 --> 00:55:57.417
but they got all the power.

00:55:58.208 --> 00:56:04.125
So the Russians are not so, I should say,

00:56:05.625 --> 00:56:07.500
fashionable

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.125
You are Russian, na? ...

00:56:15.208 --> 00:56:16.500
Again,

00:56:18.125 --> 00:56:21.291
Russians are very very brave people

00:56:23.709 --> 00:56:26.333
and they have fought their parents

00:56:27.583 --> 00:56:31.083
and now in Russia we have such a lot of Sahaja Yogis.

00:56:32.625 --> 00:56:36.291
It will happen that Russia will become whole

00:56:39.166 --> 00:56:41.250
realised soul,

00:56:42.542 --> 00:56:46.500
while here the great people who think no end of themselves

00:56:47.083 --> 00:56:51.500
will be all ending up in the lunatic asylum.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.542
So today’s my lecture, remember

00:57:00.709 --> 00:57:04.417
that you have every right to oppose your parents

00:57:04.625 --> 00:57:06.709
if they are drinking.

00:57:10.542 --> 00:57:14.125
What they think that you want all the money, that’s why,

00:57:15.375 --> 00:57:18.333
but you should say “We don’t want your money”.

00:57:23.333 --> 00:57:25.709
So now if  you are a leader

00:57:26.709 --> 00:57:29.417
and there are who are leading,

00:57:30.417 --> 00:57:33.709
you should remember if you are opposing your parents.

00:57:34.125 --> 00:57:35.709
What do you care?

00:57:39.709 --> 00:57:43.083
Russians are very brave, I must say,

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:49.458
they have told their parents off, even authorities.

00:57:52.667 --> 00:57:56.709
Why? Because they are communists? Is it that?  No.

00:57:58.709 --> 00:58:01.667
Because they are free-minded people.

00:58:03.667 --> 00:58:06.500
After all you are all Sahaja Yogis

00:58:06.667 --> 00:58:11.375
and what right they have got to dominate you.

00:58:16.125 --> 00:58:19.375
They have no right, they are drunkards

00:58:19.625 --> 00:58:22.125
how can they dominate you?

00:58:22.709 --> 00:58:25.542
You tell them ‘you are drunkards, don’t talk!’

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.083
No harm,

00:58:33.125 --> 00:58:37.583
you have to fight, you have to fight your parents, very important.

00:58:39.542 --> 00:58:41.500
I’m with you,

00:58:48.083 --> 00:58:50.125
May God bless you.

00:58:55.709 --> 00:58:59.250
They will fight for democracy, this, that.

00:58:59.417 --> 00:59:01.709
It’s all demonocracy,

00:59:02.709 --> 00:59:05.083
what is their democracy?

00:59:05.417 --> 00:59:09.333
When they drink what business they have got to dominate you?

00:59:11.250 --> 00:59:17.333
Who are they? Drunkards, put them down!

00:59:19.125 --> 00:59:20.542
You have to now fight,

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.709
the time has come, too much time you have spent

00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:29.417
and tolerated them. What have they done?

00:59:31.041 --> 00:59:32.125
Nothing.

00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:40.500
I must say Russians are very clever,

00:59:41.083 --> 00:59:44.333
and very brave…

00:59:48.333 --> 00:59:52.709
You know how they made Hitler run away,

00:59:54.166 --> 00:59:56.709
man like Hitler ran away from there.

00:59:57.458 --> 00:59:59.291
How did they manage?

00:59:59.542 --> 01:00:05.375
Because basically they are honest and brave.

01:00:09.083 --> 01:00:13.542
So we do not drink so why should we be cowards?

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:17.709
Only the drunkards can be cowards.

01:00:19.333 --> 01:00:21.333
You are not drunkards

01:00:22.166 --> 01:00:24.333
so you should be brave and tell

01:00:24.458 --> 01:00:27.709
your parents and improve your family life.

01:00:29.583 --> 01:00:35.250
Here I find the family life is so horrible.

01:00:37.083 --> 01:00:40.458
Parents are funny, mothers are funny,

01:00:41.458 --> 01:00:45.625
how can they be? How can you be their children?

01:00:46.709 --> 01:00:51.250
You should say that we are ashamed to be the children of  drunkards.

01:00:53.458 --> 01:00:55.500
They will realize.

01:01:06.291 --> 01:01:09.041
Russians have given up drinking

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.625
those who are Sahaja Yogis,

01:01:13.333 --> 01:01:16.333
they have given up completely.

01:01:25.417 --> 01:01:28.375
I don’t know what has made them like that.

01:01:31.417 --> 01:01:36.041
They are neither interested in money or position or anything,

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.166
Sahaja Yogis.

01:01:43.583 --> 01:01:49.709
The Indians have got a heritage

01:01:50.417 --> 01:01:52.375
but they also,

01:01:54.709 --> 01:01:57.458
they come to England they start drinking.

01:02:01.542 --> 01:02:06.667
They think people don’t drink because they are not free.

01:02:07.375 --> 01:02:09.375
What is the idea?

01:02:11.125 --> 01:02:13.583
If you are free you should be able to drink,

01:02:14.166 --> 01:02:16.250
you should become mad?

01:02:17.125 --> 01:02:19.667
That’s freedom, isn’t it?

01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:24.709
Now you can tell them ‘you are mad’;

01:02:28.125 --> 01:02:30.417
‘You are drinking so you are mad’.

01:02:32.625 --> 01:02:34.667
Tell them I have said it.

01:02:41.208 --> 01:02:43.625
Alright now are you convinced?

01:02:52.166 --> 01:02:54.250
Now,

01:03:02.291 --> 01:03:05.041
everybody’s getting vibrations?

01:03:06.375 --> 01:03:10.375
Is there somebody who is not getting? Please raise your hand.

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:20.417
See! How collective you are and how powerful.

01:03:23.083 --> 01:03:28.166
But I have seen that Sahaja Yogis are so afraid of their parents

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:32.208
that they group together like two cowards,

01:03:34.291 --> 01:03:38.166
you should be brave and tell them off,

01:03:38.542 --> 01:03:41.375
you have got the power to do that.

01:03:42.709 --> 01:03:49.125
If you can change your parents you have done a great job to them.

01:03:51.125 --> 01:03:53.500
What else can you do for them?

01:03:54.667 --> 01:03:59.542
If the parents are changed you have done a big job.

01:04:03.375 --> 01:04:05.166
What do you say?

01:04:07.083 --> 01:04:09.000
You are too mild.

01:04:10.083 --> 01:04:14.166
You take two, three Sahaja Yogis and beat them nicely

01:04:20.709 --> 01:04:25.208
otherwise they beat in any case after drinking,

01:04:26.709 --> 01:04:29.125
with drinking they do!

01:04:34.375 --> 01:04:35.667
It’s very sad.

01:04:37.417 --> 01:04:40.291
You all are free country people

01:04:43.417 --> 01:04:45.667
but you have to fight,

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:49.458
without the fight it won’t work out.

01:04:50.375 --> 01:04:53.542
So I want you all to meet each other

01:04:54.375 --> 01:04:57.583
and have complete sense,

01:04:58.250 --> 01:05:01.041
that you are Sahaja Yogis,

01:05:02.375 --> 01:05:06.000
that means you are being blessed by God

01:05:06.625 --> 01:05:10.250
and you are representative of God

01:05:11.208 --> 01:05:15.333
and you are not going to take to these dirty things.

01:05:18.333 --> 01:05:23.250
Respect yourselves, respect!

01:05:26.458 --> 01:05:30.166
You can tell your parents we cannot respect you for drink.

01:05:31.375 --> 01:05:35.709
Tell them, you can tell them I have said so.

01:05:41.625 --> 01:05:44.417
Look at Christ how he fought,

01:05:47.417 --> 01:05:55.250
what sort of Christians they are drinking, drinking, drinking.

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:07.417
But in India why don’t they drink? They don’t drink.

01:06:12.375 --> 01:06:17.458
They just live without drinking, they are doing well.

01:06:24.625 --> 01:06:32.041
I think you take from me that courage to fight your parents.

01:06:35.625 --> 01:06:41.000
Next time when I come I don’t want to see anybody saying

01:06:41.166 --> 01:06:43.417
that the parents don’t listen.

01:06:58.667 --> 01:07:03.250
When they are drunk you can hit them with the spoon.

01:07:14.083 --> 01:07:17.291
Even in Russia they drink quite a lot,

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:21.166
but those who have got realisation don’t drink.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.166
[unclear]… they don’t drink.

01:07:26.250 --> 01:07:28.500
That’s why I think communism is good,

01:07:29.250 --> 01:07:31.709
because they have so much courage!

01:07:36.083 --> 01:07:38.041
With all this democracy

01:07:38.208 --> 01:07:41.625
you are all becoming demons, nothing but demons.

01:07:45.125 --> 01:07:48.166
So today I take your promise

01:07:48.375 --> 01:07:53.125
that you will manage your parents well.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.709
Thank you very much.

01:08:02.667 --> 01:08:07.375
Anybody has any problems you tell me.

01:08:10.125 --> 01:08:15.208
Yogi: Mother, in my school there are many students whose family,

01:08:15.375 --> 01:08:19.041
they drink and they’re all split up. They are very disturbed…

01:08:19.208 --> 01:08:21.542
I can’t hear him

01:08:28.542 --> 01:08:33.625
When? When they have time free?

01:08:35.709 --> 01:08:38.709
Yogi: And they’re all disturbed,

01:08:39.125 --> 01:08:41.250
I can see, the students are all disturbed, Mother.

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:42.625
They want what?

01:08:43.041 --> 01:08:48.625
Sir CP: The students, their parents drink and separate,

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.458
there are lots of problems, and

01:08:50.625 --> 01:08:53.041
the young students are very upset about it.

01:08:53.208 --> 01:08:55.291
You break their bottles,

01:08:58.250 --> 01:09:01.208
you tell them I have told you.

01:09:02.333 --> 01:09:05.709
You break their bottles, you see the bottle and break it.

01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:08.208
Then you see.

01:09:09.417 --> 01:09:12.125
We have done that in India,

01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:15.709
you know when we were asking for independence?

01:09:17.166 --> 01:09:22.125
The children, they used to break their bottles.

01:09:25.208 --> 01:09:29.709
With the bottles in, you can never enjoy your freedom

01:09:31.208 --> 01:09:33.375
—  you break it!

01:09:45.166 --> 01:09:47.125
Any question?

01:09:53.625 --> 01:09:55.583
We shouldn’t insult them

01:09:56.166 --> 01:09:59.083
but you can break the bottles alright.

01:10:09.458 --> 01:10:11.417
May God bless you.

01:10:38.542 --> 01:10:40.583
May God bless you.

01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:56.208
You said you want to go to Kuwait?

01:10:57.250 --> 01:10:59.208
Yogini: Ukraine, Mother

01:11:07.583 --> 01:11:11.625
Ukraine. You want to go to Ukraine.

01:11:40.625 --> 01:11:42.583
They are very good people,

01:11:43.333 --> 01:11:46.208
Ukraine people are very good.

01:12:39.166 --> 01:12:46.250
Such a lot, beautiful, beautiful, thank you.
