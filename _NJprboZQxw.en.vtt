00:02.000 --> 00:10.000
Sashti. Sixth night of Navaratri, Sydney (Australia),
17 October 2007.

00:20.375 --> 00:26.208
This is too small.

00:53.083 --> 00:58.125
You can get a good hall here, very easily.

01:00.417 --> 01:07.333
Actually I never knew that there’s a programme

01:08.041 --> 01:11.041
otherwise I would have told you.

01:33.208 --> 01:35.166
Here also,

01:56.291 --> 02:00.250
come along, there is room here.

02:07.417 --> 02:12.083
Can you hear me there?

02:49.125 --> 02:51.041
Come forward,

03:00.166 --> 03:04.417
here put the piano that side in the corner?

03:37.166 --> 03:39.208
Why is she crying?

03:52.041 --> 03:54.250
What has she got, a cake?

04:30.417 --> 04:33.208
What is this?

04:34.166 --> 04:35.250
A gift, Shri Mataji

04:45.166 --> 04:48.166
Very beautiful, Who’s done it?

04:52.250 --> 04:53.250
Yogi: Maria and Sue

04:53.333 --> 04:55.125
You did?

04:56.041 --> 04:58.333
Very good, very good

04:59.166 --> 05:01.333
absolutly good

05:07.208 --> 05:09.083
Everything.

05:14.291 --> 05:17.000
What’s her name?

05:19.250 --> 05:20.333
Yogi: Sue Williams

05:34.125 --> 05:37.166
Thank you very much, very beautifully done.

05:43.375 --> 05:46.166
You can’t move further?

06:01.083 --> 06:03.166
Who is the leader here

06:07.417 --> 06:09.333
He is the leader?

06:12.250 --> 06:17.125
So why couldn’t you get a bigger place?

06:21.083 --> 06:24.083
Shri Mataji, we could find a bigger place

06:24.166 --> 06:27.250
but we did not want to have to transport you from here

06:27.333 --> 06:31.166
– less moving for you.
Your comfort is our only desire Shri Mataji,

06:31.291 --> 06:34.417
so yogis are happy, so long as you’re comfortable.

06:39.041 --> 06:41.250
You are all Sahaja Yogis,

06:42.291 --> 06:47.208
and there should not be controversy between you.

06:50.041 --> 06:55.333
You should all think of the same thing, isn’t it?

06:57.333 --> 07:01.291
I feel sorry so many standing outside.

07:02.125 --> 07:04.208
Come in, come in!

07:05.333 --> 07:08.333
Can you move the piano behind?

07:36.250 --> 07:38.375
Can you all hear me?

08:01.250 --> 08:05.291
Those Como people are here? Como?

08:08.333 --> 08:10.333
Sir CP: They are not here.

08:11.041 --> 08:12.250
They are not here?

08:13.000 --> 08:14.333
Both of them are not ?

08:39.125 --> 08:44.041
Yogi: Giovanni and his wife are here.

08:45.041 --> 08:47.375
You are from Como?

08:48.041 --> 08:50.041
See! He could come!

09:12.417 --> 09:14.417
You can come here,

09:16.208 --> 09:20.250
there is space, make some space there.

09:31.083 --> 09:34.291
Why didn’t you get another hall?

09:35.291 --> 09:37.333
They are so many….

09:59.166 --> 10:02.125
I’m happy to see all of you here.

10:05.333 --> 10:07.417
May God bless you.

10:19.333 --> 10:22.291
Today in the shop there was a lady.

10:22.417 --> 10:28.041
She came and she wanted to have her realisation, and she got it.

10:30.125 --> 10:32.417
Got it very well.

10:33.250 --> 10:35.375
See now it depends on…

10:36.125 --> 10:38.333
there are many who are searching.

10:39.208 --> 10:45.041
But you have to contact them, and bring them forward.

10:49.250 --> 10:54.417
Now, I don’t know, if you want to take a hall,

10:55.208 --> 10:57.208
you have to pay for it.

10:59.333 --> 11:02.291
But was this just to save money?

11:15.041 --> 11:17.166
You are so many.

11:17.291 --> 11:21.041
And you can afford to have a hall,

11:21.208 --> 11:23.333
all of you sitting there,

11:23.417 --> 11:26.250
and I feeling comfortable.

11:32.125 --> 11:35.083
After all, you are all Sahaja Yogis,

11:35.417 --> 11:38.333
all brothers and sisters,

11:41.041 --> 11:45.083
and you don’t mind any inconvenience,

11:45.417 --> 11:50.250
but if we can make something convenient, we should do it.

12:01.208 --> 12:04.291
With so many you could have got a hall…

12:04.417 --> 12:08.250
Yogi: Shri Mataji we have one big hall, in a place called Balmoral,

12:08.333 --> 12:10.166
it’s about one hour’s drive from here

12:10.291 --> 12:12.333
and  everyone could fit inside the big hall.

12:12.417 --> 12:14.250
It’s a little distance from here, Shri Mataji,

12:14.333 --> 12:18.041
it’s about one hour’s drive. Everyone would fit there.

12:18.333 --> 12:22.041
Sir CP: It would require your travelling to that place.

12:22.125 --> 12:26.166
In order not to give you trouble to travel, they all came here —

12:27.041 --> 12:31.291
No-no, I have no trouble, I have come all the way from India!

12:43.291 --> 12:49.333
For My convenience you take no such a note.

12:51.125 --> 12:55.041
See, wherever you are, wherever you have the programme,

12:55.125 --> 12:56.291
I’ll go there.

12:57.417 --> 13:01.083
As long as possible I will definitely go.

13:14.250 --> 13:18.250
These days, life is much more comfortable

13:19.250 --> 13:22.125
but when I was working in the villages

13:22.250 --> 13:25.125
I used to go on the bullock cart.

13:26.041 --> 13:29.125
You’ve got photograph, you can see

13:30.125 --> 13:33.417
– on the bullock cart, to go for miles together.

13:36.291 --> 13:39.041
I knew I had to do all that.

13:39.166 --> 13:41.333
If I have to get Sahaja Yogis,

13:41.417 --> 13:44.083
I have to work that way.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.166
And I was quite prepared.

13:49.166 --> 13:55.041
I never felt any exhaustion with it, never.

13:56.041 --> 14:00.041
On the contrary, after I meet you all I feel so happy.

14:07.333 --> 14:11.125
Now, is there somebody who has problems?

14:19.125 --> 14:23.166
Anybody. Who has problems?

14:28.041 --> 14:31.333
Yogi: You’ve blessed us all. We’re all blessed to be Sahaja Yogis.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.125
We don’t have any problems Shri Mataji. We’re with you,

14:34.208 --> 14:36.083
there are no problems.

14:46.125 --> 14:47.291
What did she say?

14:59.417 --> 15:02.125
Yogini: Shri Mataji, I have a problem.

15:03.333 --> 15:09.000
Yogi: She said she has a problem. She has a problem, Shri Mataji.

15:09.083 --> 15:10.083
What is that?

15:10.208 --> 15:12.125
Yogi: What is your problem?

15:14.291 --> 15:17.333
Yogini: Alcohol is a big problem in my family.

15:19.166 --> 15:22.333
Yogi: She’s saying her family has a problem with alcohol.

15:29.083 --> 15:32.041
Family,what is the problem?

15:37.125 --> 15:39.333
They are not in Sahaja Yoga?

15:41.125 --> 15:42.166
Why not?

15:43.291 --> 15:45.125
You are the mother?

15:49.041 --> 15:51.083
How about the children?

15:51.250 --> 15:52.417
Yogini: I have two children in –

15:54.250 --> 15:57.041
The children are… are they Sahaja Yogis your children?

15:57.125 --> 15:58.250
Yogini: No the two older children, no

15:58.333 --> 16:01.041
How many children you have?

16:01.125 --> 16:02.166
Yogi: Four children, Shri Mataji.

16:02.333 --> 16:06.291
Shri Mataji: Four children.  They are not Sahaja Yogis?

16:09.458 --> 16:13.333
Yogi: Two young children in Sahaja Yoga and the two older ones are not in Sahaja Yoga,

16:13.458 --> 16:15.375
and the husband is not in Sahaja Yoga.

16:17.417 --> 16:19.333
Surprising.

16:25.333 --> 16:28.542
But here the family system is good compared to,

16:29.083 --> 16:31.333
say, in England,

16:32.542 --> 16:37.041
where the family breaks after some time.

16:37.458 --> 16:40.500
At least here, is much better.

16:56.166 --> 16:59.458
Yogi (American accent): Shri Mataji, we in America have a problem,

16:59.542 --> 17:03.166
that the seekers don’t stay in Sahaja Yoga.

17:03.333 --> 17:06.458
Yogi: The seekers take their realisation in America,

17:07.041 --> 17:10.458
and they don’t stay in Sahaja Yoga.  This is our problem.

17:12.083 --> 17:13.166
They don’t stay.

17:13.291 --> 17:14.417
Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

17:14.542 --> 17:15.542
Why?

17:16.083 --> 17:17.375
Yogi: I don’t know Shri Mataji.

17:19.250 --> 17:21.208
It’s not complete.

17:24.333 --> 17:28.166
If they have a complete realisation,

17:28.542 --> 17:31.083
they will have to come.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.458
They are not complete.

17:35.333 --> 17:37.417
Just half way.

17:41.458 --> 17:43.125
They drink?

17:43.250 --> 17:44.041
Yogi: Yes Shri Mataji

17:44.125 --> 17:45.333
That’s the point.

17:47.417 --> 17:51.041
After coming to Sahaja Yoga you cannot drink.

17:52.166 --> 17:54.375
And that must be the reason

17:55.458 --> 17:57.542
they don’t want to come.

17:58.458 --> 18:00.542
But you give them bandhans.

18:01.333 --> 18:03.208
And beat them with shoes.

18:07.250 --> 18:10.542
Who are those…your mother, father?

18:11.083 --> 18:14.125
Yogi: My mother, my father, yes.  My good friends

18:15.333 --> 18:19.166
they take realisation but they don’t stay as Sahaja Yogis.

18:19.542 --> 18:22.458
Because they drink.
Yogi: Yes Shri Mataji.

18:25.333 --> 18:27.166
See now,

18:31.166 --> 18:37.083
all your countries have indulged into drinking.

18:37.250 --> 18:42.417
All over Europe, you see, and it’s a little fight,

18:43.041 --> 18:46.083
because for them drinking is their life.

18:46.500 --> 18:49.041
And they can’t get out of it.

18:52.375 --> 18:57.250
But we have ways.  We have to give them bandhans.

19:01.458 --> 19:05.166
If you give them bandhans, all of you put together,

19:06.250 --> 19:08.375
then they cannot run away.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.417
Bandhan has to be given.

19:13.166 --> 19:16.208
All of you should give bandhan.

19:26.542 --> 19:29.500
That’s how they have worked out in India.

19:30.500 --> 19:35.542
And India is, you know how Sahaja Yoga is strong there.

19:36.458 --> 19:39.166
The reason is if they find

19:39.333 --> 19:43.458
parents are not coming, or maybe children are not coming or whatever it is,

19:44.250 --> 19:50.333
they all work it out by giving them bandhans.

19:52.166 --> 19:59.041
But first thing, you should regularly come to SahajaYoga.

20:00.458 --> 20:02.333
Regularly.

20:03.291 --> 20:09.041
It is not half way, like today you come and then you don’t come.

20:10.291 --> 20:12.166
That’s not proper.

20:13.458 --> 20:15.709
That’s – you cannot progress.

20:19.208 --> 20:24.625
You have to come to the programmes, all of you, regularly.

20:25.625 --> 20:31.500
Because you know, realisation is not easy thing.

20:32.625 --> 20:34.709
Nobody had it before.

20:35.417 --> 20:37.709
Now you have got it.

20:38.417 --> 20:41.709
So you have to maintain it and keep it up.

20:42.625 --> 20:45.375
Once you start developing that,

20:47.250 --> 20:50.333
the female (or family?) of the house also changes.

20:51.458 --> 20:58.333
Greatest problem of Europe is – real problem, that they drink.

20:59.625 --> 21:02.250
Drinking is the main problem.

21:03.083 --> 21:06.250
And that’s why they don’t want to come to Sahaja Yoga.

21:07.125 --> 21:11.125
But they can give their parents, but not Sahaja Yoga.

21:13.583 --> 21:15.542
This is the trouble with them.

21:19.375 --> 21:21.333
Parents can be given up,

21:22.041 --> 21:25.083
in case they do not take to Sahaja Yoga.

21:26.208 --> 21:28.500
You should show you don’t like it.

21:29.709 --> 21:32.333
Why don’t they want Sahaja Yoga?

21:38.208 --> 21:44.208
They drink.
Now this is the curse of Europe, that they all drink.

21:45.208 --> 21:50.667
And drinking is something very difficult.

21:51.083 --> 21:54.083
They can’t give it up, poor things, they are slaves.

21:55.041 --> 21:56.709
Slaves of drinking.

21:57.709 --> 22:01.709
So by your behaviour, and by your affection,

22:03.583 --> 22:06.417
I’m sure you can win them over.

22:07.333 --> 22:10.709
What’s the use – people who drink die so early.

22:11.417 --> 22:15.375
You must have heard that they die very fast.

22:16.667 --> 22:20.709
But despite that they don’t realise that one should not drink.

22:21.542 --> 22:26.458
Because it has become an open market now for people.

22:28.125 --> 22:31.500
This is the biggest problem of Europe.

22:32.375 --> 22:37.125
But do you know it is much worse in America.

22:39.667 --> 22:42.709
America’s problem is so funny,

22:44.125 --> 22:49.166
that people who do Sahaja Yoga

22:50.667 --> 22:53.291
cannot convince their parents.

22:54.458 --> 22:58.083
And they think they have freedom

22:58.333 --> 23:00.500
to do whatever they like.

23:02.041 --> 23:07.166
And some of the Sahaja Yogis have lost their parents at a very early age.

23:09.083 --> 23:10.458
Very early age.

23:11.500 --> 23:17.250
Also they have parents who had heart

23:18.041 --> 23:20.208
heart attacks.

23:20.709 --> 23:22.500
All kinds of attacks.

23:22.625 --> 23:26.125
Not only heart but any other disease they get.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.458
It’s very funny,

23:30.166 --> 23:35.500
which they don’t understand how important it is to get your Realisation.

23:37.667 --> 23:40.417
So you should try to talk to them,

23:40.709 --> 23:43.417
that “what is the aim of your life.”

23:44.625 --> 23:46.333
You must ask them.

23:46.709 --> 23:49.125
“What is the aim of your life?

23:49.709 --> 23:52.709
You want to die or you want to live?”

23:53.667 --> 23:55.375
First question.

23:56.417 --> 23:59.166
If they say they want to die, let them die.

23:59.458 --> 24:01.083
You should say, “should we

24:01.250 --> 24:04.542
supply with some wines for you when you die?”

24:06.291 --> 24:08.041
Make fun of it.

24:10.542 --> 24:12.125
Make a fun.

24:13.166 --> 24:15.709
So they will realise that they are stupid,

24:16.125 --> 24:17.500
who are drinking,

24:17.709 --> 24:19.709
and they are slaves.

24:20.500 --> 24:22.583
Slaves of drinking.

24:24.166 --> 24:27.375
They are not drinking because they are free people.

24:29.709 --> 24:32.709
Because they drink, they die.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.542
And die very fast.

24:36.667 --> 24:40.125
The complication of the society is so much.

24:42.083 --> 24:44.667
That I have seen people who were rich,

24:45.250 --> 24:47.333
who had nice children,

24:47.583 --> 24:51.417
but they have lost their parenthood.

24:52.166 --> 24:54.041
They have lost the children,

24:54.417 --> 24:57.375
and they have no money also.  They are on the street.

24:59.667 --> 25:04.291
Drinking is the best way to waste all your money.

25:07.625 --> 25:10.417
They think then when you say “don’t drink”,

25:10.583 --> 25:14.250
you are interested in their money, maybe.

25:14.667 --> 25:16.625
God knows what they think because

25:17.083 --> 25:21.250
I don’t understand the psychology of people who drink.

25:22.458 --> 25:28.000
There are some bhoots I think who give them ideas like this.

25:28.500 --> 25:31.333
And they cannot give up drinking.

25:32.667 --> 25:34.375
Very wrong.

25:36.208 --> 25:39.417
Where...  in what book,

25:40.208 --> 25:45.625
I mean like bible or any book is said, that drinking is good?

25:48.208 --> 25:50.083
Did Christ drink?

25:51.375 --> 25:55.083
They will follow Christianity.

25:57.375 --> 26:02.166
They will follow Christianity, and not follow Christ.

26:04.291 --> 26:06.000
It’s like that.

26:06.583 --> 26:08.542
Christ never drank.

26:08.709 --> 26:11.083
His parents didn’t drink.

26:11.250 --> 26:15.083
Now what makes them think that they have a right to drink?

26:19.291 --> 26:21.417
Specially for Christians.

26:22.041 --> 26:27.041
Stupid they are if they think that drinking is their right.

26:28.542 --> 26:32.583
And then they have problems with drinking.

26:33.500 --> 26:36.667
Perhaps you know what problems there are.

26:37.625 --> 26:42.250
You can find out what happens when people are drunk.

26:42.458 --> 26:46.166
What happens to them, where do they go,

26:47.041 --> 26:49.000
what is their position.

26:51.709 --> 26:54.166
You can find out their friends,

26:54.667 --> 26:57.583
where are they, what they are doing,

26:58.208 --> 27:00.125
how are they living?.

27:01.250 --> 27:03.041
You’ll be amazed,

27:03.458 --> 27:06.458
that they are already on their way out.

27:10.375 --> 27:14.208
If you show your wisdom to them, with assertion,

27:17.250 --> 27:19.458
they will be coming around.

27:20.083 --> 27:21.583
You have to tell them.

27:22.208 --> 27:24.583
There’s nothing to feel shy about it.

27:26.583 --> 27:30.083
You have to tell them what happens with drinking.

27:31.041 --> 27:33.333
What is so great about it?

27:36.709 --> 27:41.417
Europe problem is drinking – first.

27:42.250 --> 27:46.375
The second problem is parenthood.

27:47.542 --> 27:51.709
Parents don’t understand the responsibility of their children,

27:53.458 --> 27:58.291
that all their lives they are going to be children of yours.

27:59.208 --> 28:01.375
And you have to look after them.

28:01.709 --> 28:05.125
There is no way of getting it out.

28:06.291 --> 28:09.166
First of all why should you have children?

28:10.041 --> 28:12.208
And if you have children,

28:12.583 --> 28:15.709
you have to jolly well look after them.

28:16.583 --> 28:21.542
But I have seen that in Europe people are really stupid.

28:23.375 --> 28:26.375
They don’t understand this simple fact,

28:27.333 --> 28:31.291
that if we cannot look after ourselves,

28:31.417 --> 28:34.125
who will look after our children?

28:36.542 --> 28:38.583
Very irresponsible.

28:39.709 --> 28:44.625
Also the society is such, that in the society also,

28:45.125 --> 28:49.583
they just believe in drinking.  All of them.

28:52.417 --> 28:56.000
Indians who do not drink in India,

28:56.333 --> 28:58.709
here they come and drink.

29:00.417 --> 29:05.125
When they come here, then they think it is something ideal,

29:05.625 --> 29:10.250
and they drink.  I have known many like that,

29:10.375 --> 29:14.041
who came abroad and started drinking.

29:15.542 --> 29:18.250
So this is the big problem.

29:19.166 --> 29:23.083
You should openly talk about it, to everyone.

29:24.375 --> 29:27.250
That what is drinking, is stupidity —

29:27.667 --> 29:33.542
to become stupid, by paying for it.

29:34.542 --> 29:39.709
You have to pay, and you have to become mad.

29:41.166 --> 29:45.250
Just imagine.  If you make fun of it,

29:46.083 --> 29:48.458
and if you can tell them the truth,

29:49.166 --> 29:52.417
I am sure they are all with the intelligence,

29:53.166 --> 29:57.458
they will understand. But you should all the time tell them.

30:03.291 --> 30:07.667
The third problem is that here it is,

30:08.083 --> 30:11.542
till you are an adult you are away and free.

30:13.542 --> 30:15.667
But I can’t understand –

30:16.125 --> 30:20.250
you are born from your parents

30:21.041 --> 30:27.500
and how do you become free after 18 years or whatever age it is.

30:28.250 --> 30:29.625
How can that be?

30:32.583 --> 30:36.375
It’s like a tree producing fruits,

30:36.542 --> 30:39.667
and the people take away their fruits and eat it.

30:40.375 --> 30:44.709
We are not trees.  We are human beings.

30:46.083 --> 30:48.542
We can’t behave like trees,

30:49.709 --> 30:55.625
which do not show any interest in their children after

30:56.166 --> 31:00.333
certain cutting has happened.

31:02.500 --> 31:04.583
But it’s very surprising.

31:05.125 --> 31:10.041
See, for us Indians it’s absolutely surprising,

31:10.291 --> 31:13.458
that they can forget about their own children?

31:14.166 --> 31:15.709
How can they do it?

31:17.583 --> 31:21.125
You have got writers who have written stories,

31:21.458 --> 31:24.458
and they have written so many things here,

31:24.625 --> 31:28.500
that how can parents be stupid like that?

31:30.250 --> 31:34.417
Whatever may be – whatever may be your father or mother –

31:34.625 --> 31:41.041
they may be poor or rich, whatever it is – they are your parents!

31:41.375 --> 31:44.417
And parents are there to look after you.

31:45.625 --> 31:51.208
The stupid thing is that they make the child look after themselves.

31:52.333 --> 31:54.709
When he is eighteen years of old,

31:55.333 --> 31:59.417
he earns of his own, and the parents – “alright, go ahead.”

32:01.166 --> 32:03.709
They want to shirk all the responsibility.

32:04.709 --> 32:10.667
Never heard of such a thing.  This is a very recent fashion.

32:15.583 --> 32:18.250
When Abraham Lincoln was there,

32:18.583 --> 32:20.625
did it happen like that?

32:28.125 --> 32:30.458
Did it happen with Christ,

32:31.709 --> 32:33.542
that Mother gave him up

32:33.709 --> 32:37.458
and said “alright, go ahead and get yourself crucified”?

32:42.291 --> 32:45.500
How can parents behave like this?

32:46.291 --> 32:48.291
They have no heart?

32:50.625 --> 32:53.625
That they have no love for their own children?

32:57.458 --> 32:59.583
India may not be that rich,

33:00.000 --> 33:04.041
but people are loving their children.

33:10.375 --> 33:14.667
Children also here do not listen to their parents,

33:15.458 --> 33:18.250
because parents don’t look after them.

33:19.041 --> 33:23.333
Can you imagine a society,

33:23.667 --> 33:26.542
religion, or whatever you may call —

33:27.125 --> 33:31.250
people have no connection with each other.

33:34.542 --> 33:37.333
But in Sahaja Yoga we are all connected.

33:38.125 --> 33:40.041
We are all one.

33:40.458 --> 33:43.500
And we want to be together

33:44.166 --> 33:49.041
with all our so-called differences.

33:50.291 --> 33:54.458
We are Indians, we are Africans,

33:55.375 --> 34:02.000
we are English, but we are all Sahaja Yogis.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.458
And this is what you have to tell them,

34:06.041 --> 34:08.500
that what kind of friends you have?

34:09.125 --> 34:12.417
They just come here for drinking and go away.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.458
They’ll not even stand by you.

34:16.208 --> 34:20.041
But our friends are our dear friends.

34:23.166 --> 34:27.625
Sahaja Yogis sometimes make mistakes, doesn’t matter.

34:28.291 --> 34:30.333
But they are Sahaja Yogis,

34:31.166 --> 34:34.041
and they are one, and they help each other.

34:35.166 --> 34:38.667
See how many countries have come together in Sahaja Yoga,

34:39.417 --> 34:42.500
and they have such friendship with each other,

34:43.250 --> 34:46.208
that you may not have with the people who are born

34:46.667 --> 34:50.166
on the same side of the Earth.

34:52.083 --> 34:54.667
You won’t recognize each other.

34:55.583 --> 34:57.542
It’s horrible.

34:58.125 --> 35:02.333
I tell you I am sometimes surprised the way

35:02.458 --> 35:05.458
parents don’t think much of their parents.

35:06.667 --> 35:11.041
Parents do not think that they are parents,

35:11.333 --> 35:14.583
and the children don’t think that we are

35:16.542 --> 35:19.542
children of these parents.

35:21.208 --> 35:23.500
I don’t know what has done that.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.542
It’s the money as they say, it’s the money,

35:27.208 --> 35:29.458
money they earn.  Alright,

35:29.667 --> 35:31.709
so what do you do with that money,

35:32.083 --> 35:36.000
make yourself miserable, and make everyone miserable?

35:38.041 --> 35:41.125
You don’t even respect money, because when you drink,

35:41.291 --> 35:43.208
how much money you waste?

35:45.291 --> 35:48.458
Does it go for any help?

35:50.375 --> 35:53.417
Then drinking, it’s – here,

35:54.041 --> 35:56.291
I was surprised,

35:58.208 --> 36:03.291
many have given up, luckily have given up, and are happy.

36:04.542 --> 36:08.166
It’s one thing, that in Europe,

36:09.333 --> 36:12.500
drinking is a big social event

36:13.458 --> 36:16.083
and everybody thinks they must drink,

36:16.375 --> 36:19.458
otherwise they are not human beings.

36:20.417 --> 36:25.166
They have to become mad, otherwise they are not.

36:26.542 --> 36:32.166
Now the parents will understand if you join together.

36:32.709 --> 36:37.125
You can bring them round, there are people who have done like that.

36:38.291 --> 36:42.333
All the Sahaja Yogis together have managed to

36:42.500 --> 36:46.333
bring the whole Johnnies to Sahaja Yoga.

36:49.709 --> 36:52.417
When they will see that you are happy,

36:52.625 --> 36:56.375
you don’t tell lies, and you are honest,

36:56.542 --> 37:02.000
and you are humble — what more do you want?

37:06.041 --> 37:08.125
But they will go to church,

37:08.375 --> 37:12.333
call themselves Christians, and behave like Satan.

37:15.542 --> 37:17.291
See their behaviour.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.709
They don’t even care for their children

37:20.125 --> 37:22.667
because they have certain habits they have developed.

37:23.458 --> 37:26.208
“Why can’t you give up those bad habits?”

37:27.208 --> 37:31.291
this is the point you should ask your parents.

37:31.709 --> 37:35.375
“Why don’t you give up this dirty stuff

37:36.375 --> 37:39.083
which is just making you mad?”

37:42.583 --> 37:45.709
Drinking makes people mad, I tell you,

37:46.166 --> 37:48.709
and all their value system is lost.

37:49.458 --> 37:55.375
Whatever you may be, whatever your education,

37:56.083 --> 38:00.333
all is useless if you take to drinks.

38:03.709 --> 38:06.500
You have no personality after that.

38:07.291 --> 38:11.709
Nothing [unclear] …the way you behave,

38:13.041 --> 38:15.583
and when people get drunk, do you see

38:16.041 --> 38:19.417
how they behave in a funny manner.

38:23.208 --> 38:25.458
So just detest it,

38:26.291 --> 38:29.375
and tell your parents you don’t like drinking.

38:30.083 --> 38:33.417
We don’t want you to drink, why do you drink?

38:36.583 --> 38:40.709
You can tell them!  Why do you drink?

38:42.125 --> 38:45.000
Because by drinking they become mad …

38:47.166 --> 38:51.667
it is better to get a certificate from mad house.

38:57.625 --> 39:02.041
You Sahaja Yogis now realize this is madness,

39:02.333 --> 39:04.166
and you have to tell them

39:04.583 --> 39:09.083
that we think that you are all mad who sit down and drink.

39:13.208 --> 39:15.375
What do you want?

39:16.542 --> 39:19.250
Drinking, what does it give you?

39:25.125 --> 39:29.083
First of all you must seek peace of your mind.

39:30.542 --> 39:33.166
That’s not possible if you drink,

39:33.417 --> 39:38.583
have you heard of somebody who has peace of mind because they drink?

39:41.500 --> 39:44.083
When he dies, maybe!

39:48.250 --> 39:52.667
So it is to be told to them frankly,

39:54.208 --> 39:58.500
why do you drink, what is the need, to waste all the money?,

40:03.667 --> 40:07.375
Mostly I have seen that they drink because they are so ignorant,

40:09.083 --> 40:13.542
that they don’t know there is a higher life and better life

40:14.250 --> 40:18.667
by which you can control your body, control everything.

40:21.625 --> 40:25.542
Once they come to know they will realize

40:26.000 --> 40:28.625
that this drinking makes you a slave,

40:29.458 --> 40:32.125
they are slaves you see,

40:32.625 --> 40:34.709
and when they tell you something you should say

40:35.125 --> 40:39.709
‘we don’t want to listen to slaves, you are all slaves’

40:40.709 --> 40:43.417
there’s no harm in telling like this.

40:44.583 --> 40:48.375
‘You are slaves and we don’t want to listen to slaves’.

40:52.375 --> 40:57.083
You see in India I don’t know somehow we have solved the problem,

40:58.041 --> 41:00.166
people don’t drink so much,

41:00.583 --> 41:03.083
because from the very beginning

41:03.333 --> 41:07.125
there the drinking is regarded as a very bad thing.

41:08.083 --> 41:12.291
If a girl knows that the fellow drinks she will never marry.

41:13.667 --> 41:21.500
So society doesn’t accept drinking is a good thing,

41:22.500 --> 41:26.583
while your  society is no society

41:27.458 --> 41:31.458
because there is no friendship,

41:31.709 --> 41:34.125
there is no understanding

41:34.291 --> 41:39.083
and they don’t think of improving the life.

41:42.041 --> 41:45.583
What do they think? They are very selfish

41:46.125 --> 41:48.417
and they think of themselves,

41:48.709 --> 41:53.542
selfishness in the sense  that becoming mad

41:53.709 --> 41:56.250
is very great selfishness.

41:58.709 --> 42:01.041
They become mad,

42:01.542 --> 42:05.291
and go on becoming more mad and more mad

42:05.458 --> 42:07.542
and it is a sickness,

42:09.291 --> 42:12.208
you should tell them that this is sickness.

42:12.709 --> 42:17.417
‘You are sick people already and we don’t want to follow you’ .

42:19.458 --> 42:22.375
Don’t be rude but you should tell them.

42:23.166 --> 42:27.208
Drinking is sickness, you say I said it.

42:29.667 --> 42:31.291
I don’t mind .

42:36.709 --> 42:40.417
Have you seen a man who is drunk?

42:41.458 --> 42:43.583
What do you think of them?

42:44.542 --> 42:47.333
They are more than mad people.

42:49.166 --> 42:52.500
People are mad because something gone wrong.

42:53.375 --> 42:57.375
But these are mad because they have been drinking,

43:00.041 --> 43:03.083
so you have to tell them ‘You are all mad.

43:03.458 --> 43:06.125
You are going to ruin your country’

43:08.291 --> 43:12.458
So many things I have seen, what happens in the West,

43:13.542 --> 43:18.500
my own experience. See I am working in Maharastra,

43:18.667 --> 43:23.083
working in India in different places

43:24.542 --> 43:28.417
but there is no problem

43:30.250 --> 43:33.208
with them when they are realised souls,

43:33.500 --> 43:38.041
but here with realised souls also I find problems.

43:40.500 --> 43:44.291
There is no problem in India if there is realised souls,

43:44.500 --> 43:47.375
they are purely  realised,

43:47.709 --> 43:51.583
and here  there are problems

43:52.417 --> 43:56.583
even with the realised people.

44:00.542 --> 44:06.333
Here there are some Sahaja Yogis who made illegal money.

44:08.417 --> 44:11.291
They are Sahaja Yogis, I know for definite,

44:11.583 --> 44:13.667
but they have done like that,

44:17.375 --> 44:24.667
they have been saved, but not in the Heaven.

44:28.083 --> 44:35.625
They work it out, save themselves but everything happens.

44:37.542 --> 44:41.500
Some people say ‘Mother we drink very little’ but why?

44:44.041 --> 44:48.583
Very common –‘very little we drink’

44:49.041 --> 44:53.083
but why? Why do you want to drink and waste your money,

44:53.500 --> 44:56.291
first of all wasting your money.

45:03.041 --> 45:04.625
It’s very sad,

45:05.583 --> 45:09.542
that all people who are so well educated,

45:10.250 --> 45:14.250
so well off, become so mad

45:15.583 --> 45:17.250
Idon’t understand

45:18.333 --> 45:22.166
And if your parents are drinking they are mad.

45:24.083 --> 45:27.125
You have to treat them like mad people.

45:28.542 --> 45:31.083
Then they will realize,

45:33.250 --> 45:35.667
you should tell them off,

45:37.208 --> 45:41.250
that you want to waste all your money in drinking.

45:42.583 --> 45:47.417
In India we have that way very strong Sahaja Yogis.

45:48.542 --> 45:53.375
They break the bottles if they come in the house…

45:54.333 --> 46:02.291
or what they do they break the….anything!

46:08.417 --> 46:11.625
The parents become really funny

46:12.041 --> 46:16.208
because they can’t understand what is happening to these children.

46:16.667 --> 46:19.125
But they are Sahaja Yogis,

46:19.542 --> 46:23.125
so they don’t like it and they just throw them out.

46:24.250 --> 46:30.333
There is no humbleness needed with the mad people.

46:31.208 --> 46:34.542
You have to see that they give up their drinking,

46:35.333 --> 46:41.542
very important, and not to feel shy about it.

46:44.625 --> 46:50.125
If you correct your parents you correct the whole nation.

46:54.583 --> 47:00.333
So you all have to work it out and discuss among yourselves

47:01.417 --> 47:04.625
and tell ‘Oh my Father drinks a lot’

47:05.375 --> 47:09.208
So you ask your friend to come and put him right.

47:09.458 --> 47:12.500
You can make fun of them, they are mad!

47:15.333 --> 47:20.709
Do not take them seriously, they are mad, have pity on them,

47:22.291 --> 47:27.542
and work it out that way. You have so many friends together.

47:28.542 --> 47:31.375
Drinking is the curse in the West,

47:33.208 --> 47:38.375
and how it has come I think some satanic force has worked,

47:39.667 --> 47:42.625
they never used to drink so much before.

47:43.625 --> 47:48.375
No! Now I don’t know,

47:49.417 --> 47:55.458
you walk on the street and you find so many of them walking along.

47:59.333 --> 48:03.667
So Sahaja Yogis should see that they don’t drink themselves

48:04.166 --> 48:07.709
and don’t allow anybody to drink,

48:08.208 --> 48:11.417
your father, mother, brother…

48:13.041 --> 48:15.625
you have to tell them ‘You are all mad!

48:18.208 --> 48:20.291
Go to some mad house’

48:21.458 --> 48:25.083
Once you tell them they will realize,

48:27.333 --> 48:30.208
it’s only you who can correct them.

48:31.542 --> 48:33.250
I may do anything

48:33.458 --> 48:37.375
but first of all these people should give up drinking?

48:39.709 --> 48:42.709
You have lot of strength as Sahaja Yogis

48:43.291 --> 48:46.458
and you have to work out on your parents.

48:48.166 --> 48:52.166
How many of your parents are drinking?
Raise your hands….

48:56.125 --> 48:57.500
Your parents also?

48:58.542 --> 49:02.291
Bah prai!  [unclear]

49:06.166 --> 49:07.667
Just imagine.

49:10.709 --> 49:16.667
You should all oppose their drinking, openly.

49:20.500 --> 49:24.583
You should say I don’t like to talk to people whodrink.

49:25.166 --> 49:30.250
Like that.  You go on and you’ll be surprised they’ll come round.

49:35.333 --> 49:41.417
It is absolutely depending on you.

49:42.250 --> 49:47.709
If your parents are drinking you have to take a very strong view.

49:48.333 --> 49:51.625
And you have so many other friends, also, to help you.

49:53.583 --> 49:56.041
Make fun of them.

49:56.500 --> 50:02.208
Somebody should copy as to how they behave after drinking,

50:02.417 --> 50:04.542
how they walk.

50:05.709 --> 50:09.709
You should not insult them but to copy them.

50:12.083 --> 50:15.208
Once they will know there is no respect

50:16.125 --> 50:19.625
and care for the parents they’ll be alright.

50:23.542 --> 50:30.125
But even if they drink you are not so much bothered –

50:31.709 --> 50:35.166
you are not bothered as to — if they are drinking,

50:36.208 --> 50:40.291
but you should say that you are all  mad, where will you be going?

50:41.417 --> 50:44.208
What will happen to you?

50:49.291 --> 50:52.667
You can talk like elderly people with them

50:56.500 --> 51:00.500
and also see that they don’t have friends who drink,

51:02.041 --> 51:05.500
if they have friends like that you’d better tell the friends.

51:13.583 --> 51:15.250
You see

51:15.542 --> 51:20.291
it’s not only you get responsibility when you get your realization

51:20.458 --> 51:25.125
but it is your absolute  responsibility

51:25.333 --> 51:31.500
that you improve your parents and improve your brothers and sisters,

51:38.625 --> 51:41.500
you have to boss over them

51:42.542 --> 51:47.500
and you have to tell them, nothing to feel shy.

51:49.375 --> 51:51.625
Because they are mad, you know!

52:00.000 --> 52:02.667
Very important forSahaja Yogis.

52:05.291 --> 52:11.458
My experience is this, that there are Sahaja Yogis

52:12.166 --> 52:18.208
in the West who are born, who get realization,

52:18.583 --> 52:22.625
who are very good, who are excellent, I don’t have to say anything.

52:24.208 --> 52:28.542
But they are humble before their parents.

52:31.333 --> 52:34.333
You try to show that you don’t like it.

52:36.125 --> 52:41.500
If they are drinking don’t sit there, get out of that place.

52:43.041 --> 52:45.500
You should try to denounce the whole thing.

52:46.000 --> 52:47.500
There’s no harm.

52:52.291 --> 52:57.083
If somebody says harsh words you fight it back.

52:57.542 --> 53:02.583
But what about all these drunkards who are sitting and drinking?

53:03.208 --> 53:05.458
You have to tell them all.

53:06.583 --> 53:10.041
It’s only you who can improve your society.

53:12.250 --> 53:15.583
I’m here to tell you,

53:23.583 --> 53:27.250
but you people are very subdued .

53:29.458 --> 53:34.250
How many of you fight with the parents, tell me, raise your hands.

53:37.333 --> 53:39.083
Hardly any.

53:47.333 --> 53:50.417
You are afraid of them, these drunkards?

53:57.375 --> 53:59.500
They should be afraid of you

54:01.291 --> 54:03.542
and hide themselves somewhere.

54:07.291 --> 54:10.250
If there are bottles in the house you break them.

54:12.333 --> 54:14.041
Of course!

54:14.625 --> 54:17.375
You throw them away, break them.

54:18.208 --> 54:21.125
That’s how you have to fight them.

54:25.458 --> 54:30.041
How did we manage the British to go away from India?

54:33.709 --> 54:36.375
By protesting!

54:42.000 --> 54:48.208
By protesting their domination, that’s all! Simple!

54:51.458 --> 54:53.542
And they went away.

54:54.375 --> 54:57.375
Can you imagine, there was no war, nothing,

54:57.583 --> 54:59.375
and they all left us.

55:06.667 --> 55:09.625
Because they say it is cold that’s why we drink.

55:10.208 --> 55:15.417
No need, there is no need to drink for that.

55:18.291 --> 55:23.166
I know so many Indians, so many of them,

55:24.542 --> 55:32.125
they don’t drink, they have never seen such a cold country.

55:33.583 --> 55:36.709
Now also many Russians they don’t drink.

55:38.083 --> 55:40.208
Very cold country, Russians,

55:40.542 --> 55:44.625
and they don’t allow their parents also to drink, you know Russians.

55:46.125 --> 55:50.166
They are very brave, the way they fought.

55:50.500 --> 55:54.417
You know how Hitler was trying to dominate them

55:55.250 --> 55:57.417
but they got all the power.

55:58.208 --> 56:04.125
So the Russians are not so, I should say,

56:05.625 --> 56:07.500
fashionable

56:09.000 --> 56:12.125
You are Russian, na? ...

56:15.208 --> 56:16.500
Again,

56:18.125 --> 56:21.291
Russians are very very brave people

56:23.709 --> 56:26.333
and they have fought their parents

56:27.583 --> 56:31.083
and now in Russia we have such a lot of Sahaja Yogis.

56:32.625 --> 56:36.291
It will happen that Russia will become whole

56:39.166 --> 56:41.250
realised soul,

56:42.542 --> 56:46.500
while here the great people who think no end of themselves

56:47.083 --> 56:51.500
will be all ending up in the lunatic asylum.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.542
So today’s my lecture, remember

57:00.709 --> 57:04.417
that you have every right to oppose your parents

57:04.625 --> 57:06.709
if they are drinking.

57:10.542 --> 57:14.125
What they think that you want all the money, that’s why,

57:15.375 --> 57:18.333
but you should say “We don’t want your money”.

57:23.333 --> 57:25.709
So now if  you are a leader

57:26.709 --> 57:29.417
and there are who are leading,

57:30.417 --> 57:33.709
you should remember if you are opposing your parents.

57:34.125 --> 57:35.709
What do you care?

57:39.709 --> 57:43.083
Russians are very brave, I must say,

57:44.000 --> 57:49.458
they have told their parents off, even authorities.

57:52.667 --> 57:56.709
Why? Because they are communists? Is it that?  No.

57:58.709 --> 58:01.667
Because they are free-minded people.

58:03.667 --> 58:06.500
After all you are all Sahaja Yogis

58:06.667 --> 58:11.375
and what right they have got to dominate you.

58:16.125 --> 58:19.375
They have no right, they are drunkards

58:19.625 --> 58:22.125
how can they dominate you?

58:22.709 --> 58:25.542
You tell them ‘you are drunkards, don’t talk!’

58:27.000 --> 58:28.083
No harm,

58:33.125 --> 58:37.583
you have to fight, you have to fight your parents, very important.

58:39.542 --> 58:41.500
I’m with you,

58:48.083 --> 58:50.125
May God bless you.

58:55.709 --> 58:59.250
They will fight for democracy, this, that.

58:59.417 --> 59:01.709
It’s all demonocracy,

59:02.709 --> 59:05.083
what is their democracy?

59:05.417 --> 59:09.333
When they drink what business they have got to dominate you?

59:11.250 --> 59:17.333
Who are they? Drunkards, put them down!

59:19.125 --> 59:20.542
You have to now fight,

59:21.000 --> 59:24.709
the time has come, too much time you have spent

59:25.250 --> 59:29.417
and tolerated them. What have they done?

59:31.041 --> 59:32.125
Nothing.

59:37.500 --> 59:40.500
I must say Russians are very clever,

59:41.083 --> 59:44.333
and very brave…

59:48.333 --> 59:52.709
You know how they made Hitler run away,

59:54.166 --> 59:56.709
man like Hitler ran away from there.

59:57.458 --> 59:59.291
How did they manage?

59:59.542 --> 01:00:05.375
Because basically they are honest and brave.

01:00:09.083 --> 01:00:13.542
So we do not drink so why should we be cowards?

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:17.709
Only the drunkards can be cowards.

01:00:19.333 --> 01:00:21.333
You are not drunkards

01:00:22.166 --> 01:00:24.333
so you should be brave and tell

01:00:24.458 --> 01:00:27.709
your parents and improve your family life.

01:00:29.583 --> 01:00:35.250
Here I find the family life is so horrible.

01:00:37.083 --> 01:00:40.458
Parents are funny, mothers are funny,

01:00:41.458 --> 01:00:45.625
how can they be? How can you be their children?

01:00:46.709 --> 01:00:51.250
You should say that we are ashamed to be the children of  drunkards.

01:00:53.458 --> 01:00:55.500
They will realize.

01:01:06.291 --> 01:01:09.041
Russians have given up drinking

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.625
those who are Sahaja Yogis,

01:01:13.333 --> 01:01:16.333
they have given up completely.

01:01:25.417 --> 01:01:28.375
I don’t know what has made them like that.

01:01:31.417 --> 01:01:36.041
They are neither interested in money or position or anything,

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.166
Sahaja Yogis.

01:01:43.583 --> 01:01:49.709
The Indians have got a heritage

01:01:50.417 --> 01:01:52.375
but they also,

01:01:54.709 --> 01:01:57.458
they come to England they start drinking.

01:02:01.542 --> 01:02:06.667
They think people don’t drink because they are not free.

01:02:07.375 --> 01:02:09.375
What is the idea?

01:02:11.125 --> 01:02:13.583
If you are free you should be able to drink,

01:02:14.166 --> 01:02:16.250
you should become mad?

01:02:17.125 --> 01:02:19.667
That’s freedom, isn’t it?

01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:24.709
Now you can tell them ‘you are mad’;

01:02:28.125 --> 01:02:30.417
‘You are drinking so you are mad’.

01:02:32.625 --> 01:02:34.667
Tell them I have said it.

01:02:41.208 --> 01:02:43.625
Alright now are you convinced?

01:02:52.166 --> 01:02:54.250
Now,

01:03:02.291 --> 01:03:05.041
everybody’s getting vibrations?

01:03:06.375 --> 01:03:10.375
Is there somebody who is not getting? Please raise your hand.

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:20.417
See! How collective you are and how powerful.

01:03:23.083 --> 01:03:28.166
But I have seen that Sahaja Yogis are so afraid of their parents

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:32.208
that they group together like two cowards,

01:03:34.291 --> 01:03:38.166
you should be brave and tell them off,

01:03:38.542 --> 01:03:41.375
you have got the power to do that.

01:03:42.709 --> 01:03:49.125
If you can change your parents you have done a great job to them.

01:03:51.125 --> 01:03:53.500
What else can you do for them?

01:03:54.667 --> 01:03:59.542
If the parents are changed you have done a big job.

01:04:03.375 --> 01:04:05.166
What do you say?

01:04:07.083 --> 01:04:09.000
You are too mild.

01:04:10.083 --> 01:04:14.166
You take two, three Sahaja Yogis and beat them nicely

01:04:20.709 --> 01:04:25.208
otherwise they beat in any case after drinking,

01:04:26.709 --> 01:04:29.125
with drinking they do!

01:04:34.375 --> 01:04:35.667
It’s very sad.

01:04:37.417 --> 01:04:40.291
You all are free country people

01:04:43.417 --> 01:04:45.667
but you have to fight,

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:49.458
without the fight it won’t work out.

01:04:50.375 --> 01:04:53.542
So I want you all to meet each other

01:04:54.375 --> 01:04:57.583
and have complete sense,

01:04:58.250 --> 01:05:01.041
that you are Sahaja Yogis,

01:05:02.375 --> 01:05:06.000
that means you are being blessed by God

01:05:06.625 --> 01:05:10.250
and you are representative of God

01:05:11.208 --> 01:05:15.333
and you are not going to take to these dirty things.

01:05:18.333 --> 01:05:23.250
Respect yourselves, respect!

01:05:26.458 --> 01:05:30.166
You can tell your parents we cannot respect you for drink.

01:05:31.375 --> 01:05:35.709
Tell them, you can tell them I have said so.

01:05:41.625 --> 01:05:44.417
Look at Christ how he fought,

01:05:47.417 --> 01:05:55.250
what sort of Christians they are drinking, drinking, drinking.

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:07.417
But in India why don’t they drink? They don’t drink.

01:06:12.375 --> 01:06:17.458
They just live without drinking, they are doing well.

01:06:24.625 --> 01:06:32.041
I think you take from me that courage to fight your parents.

01:06:35.625 --> 01:06:41.000
Next time when I come I don’t want to see anybody saying

01:06:41.166 --> 01:06:43.417
that the parents don’t listen.

01:06:58.667 --> 01:07:03.250
When they are drunk you can hit them with the spoon.

01:07:14.083 --> 01:07:17.291
Even in Russia they drink quite a lot,

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:21.166
but those who have got realisation don’t drink.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.166
[unclear]… they don’t drink.

01:07:26.250 --> 01:07:28.500
That’s why I think communism is good,

01:07:29.250 --> 01:07:31.709
because they have so much courage!

01:07:36.083 --> 01:07:38.041
With all this democracy

01:07:38.208 --> 01:07:41.625
you are all becoming demons, nothing but demons.

01:07:45.125 --> 01:07:48.166
So today I take your promise

01:07:48.375 --> 01:07:53.125
that you will manage your parents well.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.709
Thank you very much.

01:08:02.667 --> 01:08:07.375
Anybody has any problems you tell me.

01:08:10.125 --> 01:08:15.208
Yogi: Mother, in my school there are many students whose family,

01:08:15.375 --> 01:08:19.041
they drink and they’re all split up. They are very disturbed…

01:08:19.208 --> 01:08:21.542
I can’t hear him

01:08:28.542 --> 01:08:33.625
When? When they have time free?

01:08:35.709 --> 01:08:38.709
Yogi: And they’re all disturbed,

01:08:39.125 --> 01:08:41.250
I can see, the students are all disturbed, Mother.

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:42.625
They want what?

01:08:43.041 --> 01:08:48.625
Sir CP: The students, their parents drink and separate,

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.458
there are lots of problems, and

01:08:50.625 --> 01:08:53.041
the young students are very upset about it.

01:08:53.208 --> 01:08:55.291
You break their bottles,

01:08:58.250 --> 01:09:01.208
you tell them I have told you.

01:09:02.333 --> 01:09:05.709
You break their bottles, you see the bottle and break it.

01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:08.208
Then you see.

01:09:09.417 --> 01:09:12.125
We have done that in India,

01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:15.709
you know when we were asking for independence?

01:09:17.166 --> 01:09:22.125
The children, they used to break their bottles.

01:09:25.208 --> 01:09:29.709
With the bottles in, you can never enjoy your freedom

01:09:31.208 --> 01:09:33.375
—  you break it!

01:09:45.166 --> 01:09:47.125
Any question?

01:09:53.625 --> 01:09:55.583
We shouldn’t insult them

01:09:56.166 --> 01:09:59.083
but you can break the bottles alright.

01:10:09.458 --> 01:10:11.417
May God bless you.

01:10:38.542 --> 01:10:40.583
May God bless you.

01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:56.208
You said you want to go to Kuwait?

01:10:57.250 --> 01:10:59.208
Yogini: Ukraine, Mother

01:11:07.583 --> 01:11:11.625
Ukraine. You want to go to Ukraine.

01:11:40.625 --> 01:11:42.583
They are very good people,

01:11:43.333 --> 01:11:46.208
Ukraine people are very good.

01:12:39.166 --> 01:12:46.250
Such a lot, beautiful, beautiful, thank you.
