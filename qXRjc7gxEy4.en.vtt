00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.032
Talk in Marathi at a Sahaja Yoga seminar in Kalwa, Maharashtra (India). 19 January 1979.

00:00:08.032 --> 00:00:21.725
To come from London to Mumbai, it feels very good – because London is a very crowded and mechanical city.

00:00:21.725 --> 00:00:39.559
And people’s overall tendency out there has also become mechanical.

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.213
So then, to come from Mumbai to Kalwa feels even better.

00:00:45.213 --> 00:00:59.389
Seeing the state of mind and faith of the people in cities,

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:08.476
I feel like going to a place where there are a few people with true devotion.

00:01:08.476 --> 00:01:17.079
Our Sahaja Yoga is going to propagate through villages. It won’t happen through the cities.

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:22.905
I have said it in the past and we experience it as well.

00:01:22.905 --> 00:01:29.457
Now that you are a little closer to Mumbai, you do have a little bit of the city air in you.

00:01:29.457 --> 00:01:41.374
But even then, people living in this pleasant natural environment, always feel the existence of God.

00:01:41.374 --> 00:01:51.452
Does God exist or not,  what all we have been reading about it till date–

00:01:51.452 --> 00:01:59.740
is there any meaning in all that or are these just some texts that have been written down to keep people confused –

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:12.790
This is the time to examine and experience it fully –

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:22.374
Because we keep coming across a lot of spurious people in the name of God.

00:02:22.374 --> 00:02:26.306
If you go to the temple, you have to give money.

00:02:26.306 --> 00:02:29.164
If you give money, then you will get closer.

00:02:29.164 --> 00:02:33.402
If a rich person visits a temple, then first he is garlanded.

00:02:33.402 --> 00:02:35.798
The biggest garland of the deity is offered to him.

00:02:35.798 --> 00:02:38.812
As if God understands the importance of being rich.

00:02:38.812 --> 00:02:45.308
And if, on top of that, he comes in a big car then he is regarded even closer to God.

00:02:45.308 --> 00:02:47.862
But God is hungry for emotions.

00:02:47.862 --> 00:02:52.860
He doesn’t understand money and the worldly opulence.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.418
He understands the richness of faith.

00:02:56.418 --> 00:03:00.598
He yearns for faith and only faith can recognize Him.

00:03:00.598 --> 00:03:04.341
Now, faith does not mean blind faith.

00:03:04.341 --> 00:03:20.012
Say some person comes to you , some bogus guru approaches after rubbing dirt on his body and comes saying that he is a big guru – and this and that.

00:03:20.012 --> 00:03:25.862
Immediately people break their heads at his feet – like coconuts.

00:03:25.862 --> 00:03:34.863
The people of our country are devoted to God and innocent.

00:03:34.863 --> 00:03:40.275
But they should be innocent in religion (Dharma), just being innocent is not sufficient.

00:03:40.275 --> 00:03:44.014
Innocent in Dharma means that you should recognize the Dharma.

00:03:44.014 --> 00:03:52.695
First of all, you should recognize – to know, whom to bow down your head before, who is the real guru and who isn’t.

00:03:52.695 --> 00:03:56.162
Every person walking down the street cannot be a guru.

00:03:56.162 --> 00:04:00.507
Perhaps, he maybe someone of a lower category than us.

00:04:00.507 --> 00:04:12.337
A person, who lives off of someone else’s money, can never be a religious guru or related to Dharma.

00:04:12.337 --> 00:04:20.797
Even if you people might earn a little, you are standing on your own feet.

00:04:20.797 --> 00:04:30.321
You too have that feeling within yourselves –that you would not depend on anyone else.

00:04:30.321 --> 00:04:35.611
So when these fake people live off of your money in this way,

00:04:35.611 --> 00:04:42.777
you should realize that they are vagabonds and someone of a very low category.

00:04:42.777 --> 00:04:47.101
They take money from you and support themselves.

00:04:47.101 --> 00:04:52.329
To consider such people as your guru or if they tell you that –

00:04:52.329 --> 00:04:57.608
we are very accomplished guru and that we can do such and such great things –

00:04:57.608 --> 00:05:03.753
and if they try to cheat you then you should be able to recognize that this person can never be religious.

00:05:03.753 --> 00:05:10.075
The other thing is – it has been said about religious or sanyasi people (people who have renounced all worldly activities),

00:05:10.075 --> 00:05:14.168
that he should not be allowed to stay in the village.

00:05:14.168 --> 00:05:17.226
Only people leading a family life can stay in villages.

00:05:17.226 --> 00:05:26.912
Sita has said in Ramayana, that if any sanyasi comes to your door step, he should be asked to stay put, he should not be allowed to stay inside the village,

00:05:26.912 --> 00:05:31.140
he should stay outside the boundaries of the village and that too for a night only.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.545
If a person gets involved with a village then how can he call himself a sanyasi?

00:05:35.545 --> 00:05:42.821
This Sita had stipulated when Ravana had cheated her as a Sanyasi.

00:05:42.821 --> 00:05:49.831
That people who wear such saffron clothes and stand in front of you have actually come to rob you.

00:05:49.831 --> 00:05:51.888
Actually what is the need to wear such clothes? –

00:05:51.888 --> 00:05:56.540
He, who has renounced all worldly things, isn’t running after anything.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:02.047
He, who is a king with no wants – why would he wear such clothes to cheat you?

00:06:02.047 --> 00:06:06.645
But human beings have an inherent instinct that there exists higher power called God.

00:06:06.645 --> 00:06:13.484
Especially the people living in rural areas are so used to nature; they are daily connected with it.

00:06:13.484 --> 00:06:15.486
If it rains then farming is possible.

00:06:15.486 --> 00:06:21.047
If the crop yield is not good, if the land is not fertile then they take it as a sign that mother earth is offended with them.

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:27.915
If there is a sudden fire somewhere, then they say   the god of fire or some goddess has been offended.

00:06:27.915 --> 00:06:34.981
If the household is affected with epidemic, then they say that they are suffering due to wrath of God.

00:06:34.981 --> 00:06:41.030
In such situations, human beings start believing in nature.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.832
And that nature itself is God – with this belief he starts worshipping the divine.

00:06:44.832 --> 00:06:52.203
Even though awareness of God is a great thing still we cannot create God.

00:06:52.203 --> 00:07:01.917
God is as He is. If you say – we will create Him our way, He is like what we say – it is not like that.

00:07:01.917 --> 00:07:05.579
God is as He is. The only thing you can do is –

00:07:05.579 --> 00:07:13.833
if you meditate upon Him and invite Him Him, then the way He appears before you – you should be able to recognize Him.

00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:20.566
However this wisdom should come to you – and you should have the awareness to recognize Him.

00:07:20.566 --> 00:07:23.520
Not only this, you should be able to feel it.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.533
So what should we do about it? What needs to be done?

00:07:28.533 --> 00:07:31.814
If I need to see you, I need to open my eyes.

00:07:31.814 --> 00:07:36.317
Through these eyes  I have to see who you are, where you come from.

00:07:36.317 --> 00:07:42.202
I need to ask you questions like where you live, which village you come from.

00:07:42.202 --> 00:07:44.946
How do I recognize you, through these eyes.

00:07:44.946 --> 00:07:48.936
If my eyes weren’t open in the first place, I wouldn’t have recognized you.

00:07:48.936 --> 00:07:53.988
To know God we have a different set of eyes within us – it is called the ‘Atma’.

00:07:53.988 --> 00:08:01.381
Until the eyes of this Atma don’t open, we cannot see God or recognize him.

00:08:01.381 --> 00:08:10.932
Until the Atma gets awakened within us, until its flame comes before us – till then there is something wrong with what we believe as God.

00:08:10.932 --> 00:08:19.362
It does not sound as truthful. Or it can be said that one cannot get complete knowledge about Him – one gets a little.

00:08:19.362 --> 00:08:23.200
Like, if someone is partly blind, he can still see a bit.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.572
So unless we open our eyes completely, until we get the eyes of our Atma,

00:08:27.572 --> 00:08:32.069
until those eyes open – we cannot recognize God.

00:08:32.069 --> 00:08:38.534
Once we keep the idol in the home temple we feel that this is our God..that it is sufficient to worship Him.

00:08:38.534 --> 00:08:42.881
But do we check on our behavior afterwards?

00:08:42.881 --> 00:08:47.381
Even if we kill or fight amongst ourselves or do something worse –

00:08:47.381 --> 00:08:52.475
we still believe that God is on our side because he is in our home temple.

00:08:52.475 --> 00:08:55.313
And if we again offer him something , that is enough.

00:08:55.313 --> 00:08:59.844
Then no one feels bad about the fact that  “ I have lied, I have robbed, I have fought,

00:08:59.844 --> 00:09:06.747
I wished ill of others “ and  “ I have done something wrong” this thought itself  doesn’t even cross the mind  –

00:09:06.747 --> 00:09:08.881
because we established a deity in  our home temple.

00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:11.564
Once the ‘arti’ is performed, rest all is taken care of.

00:09:11.564 --> 00:09:16.890
The deity doesn’t retaliate and hit us.– So we like such a ‘convenient’ God.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:23.042
But this does not facilitate us, does not do ourselves any good.

00:09:23.042 --> 00:09:26.326
Does not help our religion.

00:09:26.326 --> 00:09:29.773
It barely helps us live in this world.

00:09:29.773 --> 00:09:34.345
But then, even that peril confronts us eventually.

00:09:34.345 --> 00:09:40.390
Human being remembers God especially when he falls sick.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:43.926
He doesn’t think of Him as much in the times of happiness.

00:09:43.926 --> 00:09:49.466
But in sickness he feels that he has done something wrong- “how did I get this disease, I must have done something to displease God”.

00:09:49.466 --> 00:09:57.783
If someone suffers from Psychological issues, heart problems then – you start thinking – “what happened Mataji, what did we do wrong, why did we get this disease?”

00:09:57.783 --> 00:10:04.083
Actually, you haven’t really committed the mistake knowingly.

00:10:04.083 --> 00:10:06.475
But blindness still persists.

00:10:06.475 --> 00:10:09.904
If your atma is not awakened you are still blind.

00:10:09.904 --> 00:10:13.118
What knowledge do you have about God or dharma?

00:10:13.118 --> 00:10:16.449
All that you know is half-baked.

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:22.346
So, there needs to be a provision to help us visualize our atma.

00:10:22.346 --> 00:10:25.905
Who will make this arrangement? Can we do it?

00:10:25.905 --> 00:10:27.917
Have we created these eyes?

00:10:27.917 --> 00:10:31.289
Who has given them to us? Has God given them to us?

00:10:31.289 --> 00:10:36.415
This nose, this mouth, this body – all of it is provided by the Almighty.

00:10:36.415 --> 00:10:37.021
Have you achieved any of that?

00:10:37.021 --> 00:10:42.553
What have you done to become a human? You evolved into a humans from animals – how did that happen?

00:10:42.553 --> 00:10:45.776
What is it that you did to make that happen?

00:10:45.776 --> 00:10:57.093
So the eyes that are needed – to see the divine, to come to know the atma – those eyes will have to be provided by God only.

00:10:57.093 --> 00:10:59.251
What can we do about it?

00:10:59.251 --> 00:11:02.005
It is not going to happen by jumping up and down from morning till evening,

00:11:02.005 --> 00:11:07.202
neither are you going to achieve it by doing pujas or artis or by reciting the name of god a million times a day.

00:11:07.202 --> 00:11:13.221
First you need to know God only then His arati and pooja has some meaning.

00:11:13.221 --> 00:11:17.776
But if you just can’t see whether it is God or a stone or rock then how are you going to benefit from it.

00:11:17.776 --> 00:11:21.966
So to begin with, you should first recognize your atma.

00:11:21.966 --> 00:11:26.557
Without knowing your atma nothing is going to work, till you realize this,

00:11:26.557 --> 00:11:31.252
till such a thought gets established in your mind, you are not going to like what I am saying.

00:11:31.252 --> 00:11:33.936
So how do you open this atma?

00:11:33.936 --> 00:11:36.856
Many people have this question – “Mataji, how do we do it, ?”

00:11:36.856 --> 00:11:43.646
– I have already told you before that you cannot do anything about it. It is done by God, it is his gift.

00:11:43.646 --> 00:11:46.155
– He has given us this body, he is the one who is going to give us eyes.

00:11:46.155 --> 00:11:49.293
He is the one who will give us the vision of Atma.And he does give it.

00:11:49.293 --> 00:11:51.313
The time for it needs to come.

00:11:51.313 --> 00:11:58.582
If tomorrow, a flower starts worrying whether it is going to turn into a fruit – like “how will it happen, when will it happen”

00:11:58.582 --> 00:12:01.638
When the time comes, it will become a fruit automatically.

00:12:01.638 --> 00:12:08.724
Similarly you will have a proper vision of your atma when time comes. And it will happen for sure.

00:12:08.724 --> 00:12:12.060
Thousands have got their realization through Sahaj Yoga.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:16.603
They have had the vision of their atma – their atma started speaking through them.

00:12:16.603 --> 00:12:23.910
Without crossing the threshold or   having vision of the Supreme, what we call as vision of the atma, “atma-sakshatkar” (self-realization)—

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:27.597
until it happens, you won’t be able to even speak with Him.

00:12:27.597 --> 00:12:33.637
Morning till evening, we keep reciting the name of Lord Rama – but where is Rama?

00:12:33.637 --> 00:12:37.312
Does everyone have the right to take His name?

00:12:37.312 --> 00:12:39.979
Is each one of you entitled to call out the Supreme?

00:12:39.979 --> 00:12:45.575
Now if we say that we take our prime minister’s name – what is the use?

00:12:45.575 --> 00:12:49.224
Is he going to come running at your call? Is he your servant?

00:12:49.224 --> 00:12:55.068
– So, God is not your servant that you keep calling out his name.

00:12:55.068 --> 00:12:58.657
There needs to be some connection between Him and you first.

00:12:58.657 --> 00:13:02.764
You have to request his permission to make a connection.

00:13:02.764 --> 00:13:13.670
As you take permission before visiting the prime minister, likewise you need to take permission.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:17.507
Need to get connected with God.

00:13:17.507 --> 00:13:22.703
If you do not get connected with God and you do not get the permission

00:13:22.703 --> 00:13:28.675
and if you shout out His name at his doorstep, His guards will catch hold of you

00:13:28.675 --> 00:13:34.333
and ask you what right do you have to come here, why are you troubling Him.

00:13:34.333 --> 00:13:42.255
Hence first have the vision of your atma. Know your Atma.

00:13:42.255 --> 00:13:46.751
Then you will feel for yourselves the power of the divine starting to flow through your hands.

00:13:46.751 --> 00:13:50.937
Then you should ask that power – does god exist?

00:13:50.937 --> 00:13:58.510
You will be surprised when that power flows, and you ask such a big question, power assertively responds that yes.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:04.193
There will be strong vibrations in the hands. On being asked any such questions the power responds to you.

00:14:04.193 --> 00:14:12.835
Means you realize that this omnipresent power is present everywhere in the world

00:14:12.835 --> 00:14:17.552
and it is true when they say that not even a leaf moves without the will of God.

00:14:17.552 --> 00:14:21.401
Because it is only after the vision of your Atma, you get the vision of this power.

00:14:21.401 --> 00:14:29.824
And you recognize this power, you see it and when it starts flowing through your hands you can give it full momentum.

00:14:29.824 --> 00:14:39.460
When this power starts flowing through you, you will be surprised – your mental state and your physical state becomes perfectly alright.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:44.816
In Sahaj yoga very few people need to visit doctors after they get their realization.

00:14:44.816 --> 00:14:47.453
Everyone gets good health.

00:14:47.453 --> 00:14:50.676
If mental issues exist, they too go away.

00:14:50.676 --> 00:14:54.510
Not only that, but the overall condition of the household also becomes better.

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:56.485
Everything has to get better from every angle.

00:14:56.485 --> 00:14:59.005
Now say, if I have to visit Mr. Patil’s house tomorrow –

00:14:59.005 --> 00:15:05.894
he will clean everything up and decorate the house for my welcome.

00:15:05.894 --> 00:15:15.139
It is like that. If god decides to reside in you – your body, your mind, your intellect needs to be cleansed.

00:15:15.139 --> 00:15:17.565
Once these get cleansed God can enter.

00:15:17.565 --> 00:15:25.598
And this is the reason why the illnesses of so many people have got cured.

00:15:25.598 --> 00:15:28.162
We have cured many difficult diseases, and we continue to do it.

00:15:28.162 --> 00:15:30.313
But it is not that we cure only diseases.

00:15:30.313 --> 00:15:36.282
If you get your realization, if the light of atma spreads through you,

00:15:36.282 --> 00:15:45.479
then automatically whatever darkness exists, may be physical, mental or religious   – any kind of darkness – it has to go away.

00:15:45.479 --> 00:15:51.288
It does go away automatically. You will ask – how? Now once this light has been switched on – where did the darkness go?

00:15:51.288 --> 00:15:59.838
The same thing happens to you too, and that is why one gets uplifted from all sides in Sahaj Yoga.

00:15:59.838 --> 00:16:03.305
Not only that but he becomes eligible to enter the realm of collective consciousness –

00:16:03.305 --> 00:16:06.222
The word is difficult but is quite straightforward.

00:16:06.222 --> 00:16:11.603
There exists a power which is flowing through all of us; it exists within each of us.

00:16:11.603 --> 00:16:17.620
The moment you understand this power, – all of you are one (together) – this starts from within.

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:22.309
Means through your hands, you come to know the state of this person, what problem he has.

00:16:22.309 --> 00:16:27.286
Similarly, you know what problems you have. Due to introspection, you will have a self vision by yourself.

00:16:27.286 --> 00:16:34.208
These things happen but you don’t need lot of intelligence, don’t need money don’t need any special brain.

00:16:34.208 --> 00:16:37.207
You are human beings. Not animals that’s enough.

00:16:37.207 --> 00:16:45.040
On the contrary people who are extremely intelligent, who have lot of wealth, they don’t experience this.

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.790
So, it happens to people in the middle class and who have average intelligence.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:52.943
Now, it also won’t happen to people who are extremely poor, who don’t even have sufficient food to eat – because day and night they are worried.

00:16:52.943 --> 00:16:59.599
They will steal from here and there – I don’t have food to eat today, now what?  That’s OK.because their condition is such.

00:16:59.599 --> 00:17:08.730
But once the middle class people get their realizations, the whole society progresses and everyone benefits from it.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:12.800
Because Laxmi (the goddess of wealth) also bestows her blessings on this.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:18.488
Now everyone is worried that – “Mataji How will our lot improve?

00:17:18.488 --> 00:17:34.688
How will our financial state get better or how will our other questions get solved?

00:17:34.688 --> 00:17:39.242
What will happen to all these things?  How should we find answers to all these questions?”

00:17:39.242 --> 00:17:44.947
So what I mean is that – there is a center for Sahaja Yoga in your locality.

00:17:44.947 --> 00:17:51.429
Wherever there is a Sahaj Yoga center, there resides God.

00:17:51.429 --> 00:17:58.188
If you come to the center, your problems will be solved. Not by sitting at home.

00:17:58.188 --> 00:18:03.804
There are a lot of Sahaj yogis who think that – now we have got our realization so all our questions should get resolved by sitting at home itself.

00:18:03.804 --> 00:18:05.722
The clinic to get answers to your questions is the center.

00:18:05.722 --> 00:18:14.291
If you come to this clinic every day, every week whenever there is a program and if you ask your questions,

00:18:14.291 --> 00:18:17.537
all questions and problems will get effortlessly solved, once you have the vision of your atma.

00:18:17.537 --> 00:18:19.943
I will give you an example of this. Very simple example.

00:18:19.943 --> 00:18:24.897
You will be surprised, but it happens many times.

00:18:24.897 --> 00:18:36.839
And there are countless such examples like this, there are infinite examples like this  – You cannot imagine if it is only research or just a guesswork or that it happened by co incidence

00:18:36.839 --> 00:18:41.274
We were in London; there was this Muslim boy from Algeria.

00:18:41.274 --> 00:18:46.813
He came and told me “Mataji, for the last six months I am trying here but I am not getting scholarship

00:18:46.813 --> 00:18:50.205
and now I have run out of time and would have to go back to Algeria.” He had got his realization.

00:18:50.205 --> 00:18:51.723
“When are you leaving?” I asked.

00:18:51.723 --> 00:18:53.384
He said “I am leaving on Thursday.”

00:18:53.384 --> 00:19:05.542
So I asked him “Why don’t you leave on Tuesday? Instead of Thursday, you leave on Tuesday.” He said “Ok, if you insist, I will leave on Tuesday.”

00:19:05.542 --> 00:19:11.306
On Monday he went to his college. The list for students receiving scholarship was put up – His was the first name as the recipient.

00:19:11.306 --> 00:19:14.091
So, this is one example. Likewise there are many such examples.

00:19:14.091 --> 00:19:19.888
If you ask your fellow yogis in Mumbai, each one  will enumerate examples with copious accounts.

00:19:19.888 --> 00:19:25.148
I told you this as an example. There are many such questions that get solved easily, very effortlessly.

00:19:25.148 --> 00:19:29.062
But to get them solved you need to visit the center.

00:19:29.062 --> 00:19:34.768
It is true that wherever people get together to worship, God will be present there.

00:19:34.768 --> 00:19:39.680
If you say – “No, Mataji you need to come to my home. Whatever is there at my home….” – which is ‘your’ home?

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:43.725
While in collectivity, if you think only about yourself then, God will never come.

00:19:43.725 --> 00:19:47.381
Because you are in the collective consciousness.

00:19:47.381 --> 00:19:51.729
Wherever people come together and remember Him, God is present there.

00:19:51.729 --> 00:20:01.037
He is not just for you alone. People even come and order me- “Mother I ‘have’ to get a job, my child ‘should’ complete his education”.

00:20:01.037 --> 00:20:08.599
Then, “my daughter ‘should’ get married”. Then, “my house ‘should’ get constructed”. This ‘should’ happen, that ‘should’ happen.

00:20:08.599 --> 00:20:12.023
I ask, “Why?” “Because I purposely came to see you.”

00:20:12.023 --> 00:20:24.142
As if, this is a God’s shop where you come and ask for different things for specific payment against each of them.

00:20:24.142 --> 00:20:29.867
We ask as if we are buying something from a shop.

00:20:29.867 --> 00:20:37.391
You shouldn’t ask this way. Instead, you should say – Whatever belongs to me is in front of you.

00:20:37.391 --> 00:20:42.964
You only see! It is only You that we desire. Once we get you, we don’t want anything.

00:20:42.964 --> 00:20:45.103
Once you say this, all the questions get solved.

00:20:45.103 --> 00:20:48.588
These questions pose no challenge to God.

00:20:48.588 --> 00:20:53.659
Nothing is difficult for Him. He just needs to twirl his little finger (pinkie) and the work is done.

00:20:53.659 --> 00:20:59.154
Till date people used to think that God does everything, this and that..

00:20:59.154 --> 00:21:08.123
A lot of people told me that they went as “Varkarees” (Devotees of Lord Vitthala) there and beseeched Vitthala to do this and that. Nothing happened; God did not fulfill their wishes.

00:21:08.123 --> 00:21:13.189
But that is not the case now. You hadn’t got your realization before.

00:21:13.189 --> 00:21:17.490
So you didn’t have the license to go there, to ask anything from Him.

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:21.649
Now that you have the vision of atma, see for yourself what powers you have.

00:21:21.649 --> 00:21:28.088
First see who you are, and after that you will be surprised – whatever you say will happen.

00:21:28.088 --> 00:21:40.543
As now you are governed by the angels, Deities like Ganesha, Hanuman and Bhairava are standing behind you. And they are all fully competent to get your work done.

00:21:40.543 --> 00:21:46.883
But you need to experience this. It is not like some guru giving you a sermon and you believe him.

00:21:46.883 --> 00:21:51.430
I am not giving you a sermon but trying to get you a firsthand experience of what is true.

00:21:51.430 --> 00:22:02.233
The people in villages are simple and straightforward. And they don’t even have much money.

00:22:02.233 --> 00:22:07.321
Maybe that is the reason they understand God better. They can recognize him as well.

00:22:07.321 --> 00:22:10.484
A villager can easily make out who is a genuine person.

00:22:10.484 --> 00:22:12.788
A city dweller cannot fathom it yet.

00:22:12.788 --> 00:22:18.236
Most of the gangsters, very famous and very dirty gurus; they all reside in the cities.

00:22:18.236 --> 00:22:24.107
They have neither reason nor the desire to come to villages. Because one cannot make money out here.

00:22:24.107 --> 00:22:26.978
They don’t want any love. They want money.

00:22:26.978 --> 00:22:33.101
If at all a few of them are not able to get anything in the city, then they  wander back to the villages.

00:22:33.101 --> 00:22:42.582
So there are lots of expectations from you all. The almighty has brought you all to place full of natural beauty – There has to be a reason for that.

00:22:42.582 --> 00:22:51.746
And the main reason is that if you realize who God is then you will be able to imbibe it within yourself very well.

00:22:51.746 --> 00:22:56.731
The city dweller won’t be able achieve this. Not as much as you could.

00:22:56.731 --> 00:23:01.128
Because you haven’t learned the notorious behavior like the city people have.

00:23:01.128 --> 00:23:03.526
All that dirt still hasn’t entered into you.

00:23:03.526 --> 00:23:08.759
Extremely filthy things are going on in the cities and the people out there have taken to them.

00:23:08.759 --> 00:23:13.694
The state of their minds is such that – if I try to sow any seed in them, it is very painful.

00:23:13.694 --> 00:23:20.690
To tell you, if someone asks me to work out Sahaj Yoga in London I feel very bored.And I feel very tired.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:23.479
To look at, the people out there are all well-dressed, fair and good looking.

00:23:23.479 --> 00:23:27.224
But inside there is so much dirt in them, that I don’t feel like exerting.

00:23:27.224 --> 00:23:33.323
Instead if someone asks me to come to Kalwa and work, I am absolutely ready. – if you make me a small hut over here, I’m am ready to come here and stay.

00:23:33.323 --> 00:23:38.666
I’ll enjoy it. But it is not so in London, because the people out there are very dirty.

00:23:38.666 --> 00:23:44.325
And their state is so dirty that you can’t even have them standing at your doorstep.

00:23:44.325 --> 00:23:50.234
But what to do – one has to face whatever is in your fate. My husband got posted out there and I had to go along.

00:23:50.234 --> 00:23:56.240
And when it was time to uplift people out there, I am doing that as well, and many English people have got their realization.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.832
But none of them are  even remotely compareable to you. (the dust of your feet).

00:23:58.832 --> 00:24:02.389
They have faith but they lack the innocence you have.

00:24:02.389 --> 00:24:04.730
So there is nothing to learn from them.

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:12.546
You might think that as they have a couple of clothes more or have cars so they are living in luxury and comfort, but it is not so. They are actually a very sad lot.

00:24:12.546 --> 00:24:15.622
One out of every ten commits suicide.

00:24:15.622 --> 00:24:19.617
And out of ten, seven have broken marriages.

00:24:19.617 --> 00:24:29.606
Such is the situation out there. So, in such a country, to imagine that any religion could exist  seems impossible.

00:24:29.606 --> 00:24:36.782
Every week, two kids are aborted by their parents in that country. Good children. Life is snuffed out of them.

00:24:36.782 --> 00:24:41.710
The mother kills them, herself, by strangling them. Every week. Have you heard of anything like this? Every week.

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:44.841
A mother, from here, would love her child so dearly.

00:24:44.841 --> 00:24:49.058
And you have such barbaric people out there – absolutely barbaric. Totally mechanical.

00:24:49.058 --> 00:24:53.138
They have no emotions. So you should never try to become like them.

00:24:53.138 --> 00:25:02.697
The country’s ancient wealth is that of love, we need to preserve this importance of love – our rich heritage.

00:25:02.697 --> 00:25:05.627
Because, the power of the almighty is that of love.

00:25:05.627 --> 00:25:12.545
He is hungry for love – so you should have love on your mind, you should always stay in love. And you should only enjoy love.

00:25:12.545 --> 00:25:21.738
Over here, Mr. Patil has started this beautiful thing (Sahaja center at Kalwa) and slowly the vibrations have improved out here.

00:25:21.738 --> 00:25:25.449
I felt that today and I felt very happy about it.

00:25:25.449 --> 00:25:32.875
To be honest ,at the doorstep itself,  I went into meditation. And in that meditative state I felt that this place would someday become a fertile holy land.

00:25:32.875 --> 00:25:38.714
And would become a significant place. Not only this but would become a pilgrim spot.

00:25:38.714 --> 00:25:41.318
Such are the vibrations that I have felt here.

00:25:41.318 --> 00:25:49.388
I have been here several times before but this time I felt tremendous joy – and all my blessings are on this Kalwa and on all of you.

00:25:49.388 --> 00:25:57.395
By the grace of god, one day, this place is going to become very renowned and you all and your children will be blessed with their well-being in a religious sense.

00:25:57.395 --> 00:26:04.745
I hope it happens in my presence in my lifetime. I will be very happy then.

00:26:04.745 --> 00:26:07.551
My blessings to you all.

00:26:07.551 --> 00:26:14.695
If you have question, do ask……. That, you need to see within yourself.

00:26:14.695 --> 00:26:28.288
Close your eyes and feel.

00:26:28.288 --> 00:26:33.640
If your eyelids are fluttering while your eyes are closed then you have to open your eyes.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:37.829
But if they don’t, then close your eyes.

00:26:37.829 --> 00:26:43.467
And you will be surprised – if you see within yourself, no thought comes to you.

00:26:43.467 --> 00:26:45.534
You feel completely peaceful inside.

00:26:45.534 --> 00:26:54.323
Close your eyes and see if you are getting any thoughts. All of you close your eyes and see if you are getting any thoughts.

00:26:54.323 --> 00:27:01.779
Because when the energy awakens and goes towards the agnya chakra, then one does not get any thoughts.

00:27:01.779 --> 00:27:04.776
You get into thoughtless awareness.

00:27:04.776 --> 00:27:14.929
Some people might be feeling something cool coming out of their hands, like a cool breeze.

00:27:14.929 --> 00:27:17.281
As if an air conditioner is put on.

00:27:17.281 --> 00:27:22.628
Those who are experiencing this cool feeling in their hands they have got their realization.
