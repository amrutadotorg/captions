WEBVTT

06:22.000 --> 06:28.792
Today we have assembled here to do the puja

06:29.250 --> 06:32.625
of the Mother Earth.

06:33.000 --> 06:38.750
We call it as the Bhoomi Puja, Shri Dhara Puja.

06:39.375 --> 06:41.625
She’s called as Dhara.

06:42.999 --> 06:45.750
As you know, “dha” means “sustain.”

06:46.750 --> 06:52.083
Ra-dha – the one who sustains the energy is Radha.

06:52.959 --> 06:57.125
And Dhara, which is

07:00.583 --> 07:04.375
the one which is sustenance itself,

07:09.041 --> 07:09.875
She sustains us.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.125
On Her we live.

07:18.125 --> 07:20.458
As you know,

07:21.333 --> 07:27.542
this Mother Earth is revolving with a tremendous speed,

07:28.834 --> 07:31.959
and but for Her gravity

07:32.542 --> 07:36.417
we would not have existed here.

07:37.125 --> 07:40.000
Apart from that,

07:40.875 --> 07:44.291
there is so much atmospheric pressure on Her.

07:50.208 --> 07:57.583
She understands, thinks, coordinates, and creates.

08:02.792 --> 08:07.542
This only you can find out when you are a realized soul.

08:09.250 --> 08:13.125
You have seen how She sucks in your negativity

08:13.125 --> 08:16.083
when you are standing on Her – bare feet,

08:16.542 --> 08:17.542
respecting Her,

08:17.792 --> 08:20.834
requesting Her to suck your negativity,

08:21.333 --> 08:27.834
with a light in front of you,

08:30.125 --> 08:33.917
in front of My photograph.

08:34.917 --> 08:38.000
She knows Me,

08:38.750 --> 08:42.959
because She’s My Mother.

08:44.125 --> 08:47.875
She’s your Grandmother, we can say;

08:48.500 --> 08:53.875
that’s why She nourishes you, She looks after you.

08:54.834 --> 08:59.542
Early in the morning when we get up,

09:00.291 --> 09:02.208
when we put our foot on Her we have to say,

09:02.583 --> 09:07.333
“Oh Mother, please forgive us

09:07.667 --> 09:10.667
we are touching You with our feet.”

09:11.041 --> 09:14.125
But doesn’t matter, children can touch the mother with

09:14.375 --> 09:20.959
the feet or with the hands – makes no difference.

09:22.375 --> 09:29.834
But She is the creator of the body of Shri Ganesh.

09:31.417 --> 09:33.917
She’s the one who is represented within us

09:34.417 --> 09:36.917
as the Kundalini.

09:37.125 --> 09:44.291
She Herself moves in a spiral round the sun.

09:46.083 --> 09:49.667
The sun also moves up and down,

09:50.083 --> 09:53.333
and She moves around the sun in a spiral;

09:54.458 --> 09:57.667
but because both are relatively moving,

09:58.208 --> 10:02.000
you don’t see the movement of the sun.

10:08.125 --> 10:12.041
The relationship between the Mother Earth and all other

10:13.250 --> 10:16.500
stars, planets, and constellations

10:17.250 --> 10:23.667
are kept constant, unvariable with great care.

10:28.750 --> 10:31.417
When we talk of materialism,

10:33.458 --> 10:38.792
we are acting against our Mother Earth.

10:42.333 --> 10:47.000
Instead of learning from Her subtler qualities,

10:47.583 --> 10:50.625
we are trying to exploit Her, to dig her out,

10:51.041 --> 10:55.250
to use Her for our selfish motives.

10:56.999 --> 11:00.083
What does She do to us?

11:01.041 --> 11:04.667
She creates these beautiful fruits for you to eat.

11:05.208 --> 11:08.542
She creates beautiful trees for you to make furniture,

11:08.999 --> 11:10.917
to make nice houses.

11:11.417 --> 11:15.959
She gives you green grass to soothe your nerves.

11:18.250 --> 11:24.166
She carries so many rivers and so many huge big oceans

11:24.750 --> 11:27.375
on Her being.

11:27.834 --> 11:31.834
She’s always larger than the largest of oceans.

11:34.083 --> 11:35.500
Such a great thing as She is,

11:36.667 --> 11:41.291
what do we do to Her is to exploit Her fully,

11:42.208 --> 11:44.417
indiscriminately.

11:44.792 --> 11:47.125
Then the reactions are set in.

11:47.500 --> 11:50.041
The beautiful cycle of nature is broken

11:50.041 --> 11:52.750
by our aggressive attitude,

11:53.959 --> 11:56.959
and absolutely indiscreet.

11:57.542 --> 12:02.875
Then this Mother Earth doesn’t do anything as such

12:03.208 --> 12:06.333
Herself, not much;

12:06.792 --> 12:10.000
but then the ether starts acting,

12:10.458 --> 12:16.000
and you have problems, what we call as acid rains,

12:16.500 --> 12:21.000
plastic, all kinds of problems that come out of this

12:21.375 --> 12:24.583
indiscreet creation.

12:25.709 --> 12:28.291
When we started making machinery,

12:28.291 --> 12:30.500
without any balance

12:32.500 --> 12:34.917
we started producing machinery,

12:37.125 --> 12:38.959
just like mad.

12:39.417 --> 12:40.291
As a result of that,

12:40.959 --> 12:44.625
now we have become slaves of machines.

12:45.083 --> 12:47.291
We can’t do anything with our own hands.

12:47.834 --> 12:52.166
Because of machines, people have become unemployed.

12:52.542 --> 12:56.208
As I’ve said many a times that machines are for us,

12:56.583 --> 12:58.792
we are not for the machines.

12:59.208 --> 13:01.667
But today the situation is very different.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.709
We are entirely into the hands of machines –

13:05.083 --> 13:08.375
again the same indiscreet behavior,

13:09.000 --> 13:12.458
again the same imbalances.

13:13.917 --> 13:16.583
Mother Earth teaches us balance.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.875
If She was not in a balance,

13:19.291 --> 13:21.500
we would have been all finished.

13:21.959 --> 13:23.999
She teaches us gravity.

13:24.417 --> 13:30.917
She teaches us how to be attractive to another person

13:31.291 --> 13:35.083
without the other person knowing about it,

13:35.417 --> 13:38.417
feeling about it.

13:40.083 --> 13:46.041
Without enslaving, without mesmerizing,

13:47.208 --> 13:54.166
without obliging, to attract and to give

13:54.583 --> 13:57.250
without expectations.

13:57.625 --> 14:00.709
Without any expectations She gives us;

14:01.000 --> 14:02.834
whether we respect Her not,

14:03.125 --> 14:04.917
whether we’ll treat Her not,

14:05.208 --> 14:06.333
we give Her.

14:07.041 --> 14:12.959
But when She gets very upset, like as in –

14:14.125 --> 14:19.959
you have heard that in Mexico She erupted out.

14:20.208 --> 14:21.542
You know what was happening in Mexico,

14:21.542 --> 14:23.291
I was telling you long time back,

14:24.041 --> 14:27.208
that they are using all kinds of black magic,

14:27.999 --> 14:31.333
they are producing all kinds of drugs.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.542
Colombia is doing the same.

14:36.417 --> 14:39.458
And if you do all these things to harm people,

14:39.875 --> 14:45.083
then She gets into volcanic conditions,

14:45.709 --> 14:49.709
and then a volcano starts bursting out.

14:51.333 --> 14:56.959
As you know, Los Angeles and all these places

14:57.500 --> 14:59.250
on the western coast of America

14:59.625 --> 15:03.125
are still in the danger of volcanoes.

15:03.583 --> 15:05.999
All kinds of gurus have gone and settled there,

15:06.375 --> 15:07.999
all kinds of black magic is on.

15:08.500 --> 15:12.375
There is witchcraft which is officially recognized.

15:12.875 --> 15:14.792
Officially they are registered.

15:14.792 --> 15:17.125
Nobody minds doing anything,

15:17.500 --> 15:19.417
because they say you have human freedom

15:19.875 --> 15:22.875
to do all kinds of devilish things.

15:23.166 --> 15:26.083
Under the name of human freedom they are doing

15:26.417 --> 15:27.959
all kinds of horrible things.

15:28.291 --> 15:31.083
As a result of that, Mother takes the respite.

15:31.333 --> 15:34.333
It is always a collective respite.

15:34.667 --> 15:38.291
It is always a collective respite, please remember this.

15:38.583 --> 15:44.000
But when Sita wanted to leave Shri Rama,

15:44.542 --> 15:48.125
She opened Herself and took Her inside Herself.

15:48.834 --> 15:51.208
That is a reception of the Mother,

15:51.583 --> 15:54.792
that is not the destruction or eruption.

15:55.208 --> 15:58.709
But the eruption harms collectively, and sometimes

15:58.959 --> 16:03.417
some innocent people are also killed in that.

16:09.291 --> 16:14.083
Death does not exist, in the divine language.

16:14.625 --> 16:17.166
Those who are dead can be reborn.

16:17.667 --> 16:22.417
But death sometimes could be used for punishing people,

16:25.333 --> 16:30.917
for destroying them, for taking them away from the scene.

16:31.375 --> 16:33.500
That’s what the Mother Earth does.

16:33.959 --> 16:43.125
Sometimes Her anger can be so great that pin-pointedly

16:43.458 --> 16:45.083
She can destroy

16:46.125 --> 16:50.083
thousands and thousands of miles of earth,

16:50.834 --> 16:56.375
destroying many people who have been extremely

16:56.959 --> 17:00.500
irreligious and uncollective.

17:01.041 --> 17:02.750
In Sahaja Yoga also,

17:03.291 --> 17:05.041
those people who are uncollective,

17:05.417 --> 17:09.166
try to be uncollective, are harmed by Her;

17:09.166 --> 17:13.458
but in a very secretive way

17:14.125 --> 17:16.625
which they must understand,

17:17.041 --> 17:20.291
or we should say, in a very subtle way.

17:21.166 --> 17:24.875
When Sahaja yogis become uncollective, saying,

17:25.250 --> 17:29.999
“This is my house, my home, this is my privacy.

17:30.291 --> 17:34.041
This is my wife, my child, my things.

17:34.333 --> 17:38.792
I cannot come to puja because I have got this problem.

17:39.083 --> 17:41.458
I cannot do this work for Sahaja Yoga because I’ve got

17:41.750 --> 17:46.959
that problem” – when they become uncollective,

17:47.333 --> 17:50.709
then in a very subtle way this Mother Earth,

17:51.041 --> 17:54.375
which is represented within us as the Kundalini,

17:54.792 --> 17:57.125
gets upset.

17:57.709 --> 18:03.166
And when She gets upset, She starts acting in a manner

18:03.999 --> 18:09.208
which can be very dangerous for people.

18:10.625 --> 18:14.999
Possessiveness is not the quality of Mother Earth,

18:15.417 --> 18:17.875
She doesn’t possess anyone.

18:17.875 --> 18:20.999
For example, if you are an Indian

18:21.250 --> 18:23.875
you can come to England, you can go anywhere,

18:24.083 --> 18:25.500
you can live anywhere.

18:25.999 --> 18:27.834
She doesn’t possess anyone as such;

18:28.208 --> 18:32.834
we only the human beings have made this world into

18:33.166 --> 18:35.166
different countries, different places –

18:35.500 --> 18:39.000
all our own ideas of stupidity.

18:40.041 --> 18:42.041
There’s only one world,

18:42.417 --> 18:45.041
there’s only one world God has created.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.625
He has not created …

18:47.083 --> 18:51.333
It’s rather awkward here. Allright now better.

19:09.208 --> 19:13.333
She has not created all these nations.

19:13.333 --> 19:16.625
Only there are ravines

19:17.542 --> 19:22.333
through which big rivers flow.

19:22.792 --> 19:26.208
Sometimes, wherever She has raised Herself,

19:26.959 --> 19:29.375
there are mountains.

19:29.792 --> 19:34.041
These are Her different dulations and different varieties,

19:34.458 --> 19:36.375
just to create beauty.

19:36.750 --> 19:39.834
Supposing the whole world was like a bald-headed

19:40.417 --> 19:44.709
gentleman, what would have happened to us?

19:44.709 --> 19:49.750
First of all, we all would have slipped out, I think!

19:50.375 --> 19:53.542
Or else, what would have happened

19:53.999 --> 19:58.417
if it was nothing but just all over the forest,

19:58.750 --> 20:01.625
or all over only the mountains,

20:01.999 --> 20:04.792
or all over just the rivers?

20:08.834 --> 20:13.500
To create the beauty She has used all these things

20:13.834 --> 20:20.999
to make us happy, to give us joy, to entertain us.

20:21.291 --> 20:24.792
She created all this beautiful stage for us.

20:25.208 --> 20:26.875
And what do we do?

20:27.291 --> 20:29.999
We have divided Her into parts,

20:30.208 --> 20:32.917
that this is my country,

20:33.333 --> 20:38.125
this is your country, this is their country.

20:39.000 --> 20:44.458
When we die, what is our country?

20:46.500 --> 20:47.875
We are all dead bodies,

20:48.250 --> 20:51.542
whether you are buried in a church or in the open,

20:51.999 --> 20:54.083
you are all in the Mother Earth.

20:54.417 --> 21:00.000
What is our country is that we are the Mother Earth.

21:00.542 --> 21:03.667
So we have to understand that this body is made

21:04.083 --> 21:06.709
out of that Mother Earth to which it has to go,

21:07.250 --> 21:09.125
and we are stupid to feel that we belong to this country

21:09.500 --> 21:11.250
or to that country.

21:11.250 --> 21:15.999
Of course, this is the greatest miracle of the maya,

21:16.458 --> 21:17.542
that people know this

21:18.083 --> 21:20.667
but still they do not want to believe it.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.917
There are so many truths they know:

21:23.250 --> 21:25.542
they are sure, they know about it,

21:25.999 --> 21:28.000
but they don’t want to believe it.

21:28.458 --> 21:31.333
Or they believe it, but they don’t want to accept it.

21:31.667 --> 21:32.959
And even if they accept it,

21:33.333 --> 21:36.000
they don’t want to know about it.

21:36.417 --> 21:40.583
It’s a funny human miracle that they know

21:41.083 --> 21:43.333
that nothing belongs to us.

21:43.792 --> 21:46.667
When we come on this Earth our hands are like this;

21:47.125 --> 21:50.083
when we go, everything is like this.

21:50.083 --> 21:53.500
Despite that, despite this understanding

21:53.917 --> 21:58.125
we still play games with ourselves, cheat ourselves,

21:58.500 --> 22:00.625
and try to believe that I am this country,

22:00.875 --> 22:05.834
I am that country, I am so great, and so that.

22:05.834 --> 22:10.709
But human beings were born in certain countries

22:11.208 --> 22:13.792
earlier than in other countries.

22:14.208 --> 22:17.000
That has definitely made difference to the tradition and

22:17.333 --> 22:20.917
understanding of life, that is human life.

22:21.250 --> 22:25.291
Earth remains the same, but this changes.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.959
The climate may be different,

22:29.291 --> 22:32.166
that’s why the fruits may be different.

22:32.667 --> 22:34.500
It’s all an adjustment.

22:34.834 --> 22:38.208
In the whole plan there is such a good adjustment,

22:38.625 --> 22:42.333
no quarrel, no problem; it’s just a variety again.

22:42.333 --> 22:46.208
Supposing all bananas are produced all over the world,

22:46.667 --> 22:47.625
who would care for them?

22:48.083 --> 22:50.417
For example, if you give bananas to Indians,

22:50.792 --> 22:54.083
they will laugh at it. But if you give them apples,

22:54.458 --> 22:58.333
they’ll say, “Oh, apples, wait!”

22:58.792 --> 23:01.125
The other way round for the English:

23:01.375 --> 23:03.458
if you want to give somebody present as an apple,

23:03.792 --> 23:09.375
they’ll look at you, “What’s the matter with this person?”

23:11.083 --> 23:15.333
So this is again Her own style of playing

23:16.041 --> 23:17.917
and giving you different type of climates,

23:18.208 --> 23:19.792
different type of produces,

23:20.166 --> 23:21.667
so that you enjoy different things.

23:22.208 --> 23:25.417
If there is no variety, then you won’t be able to enjoy it.

23:25.834 --> 23:27.125
How much She understand you,

23:27.458 --> 23:30.667
and how much do we understand Her?

23:31.333 --> 23:34.000
For a Sahaja yogi it is important to understand

23:34.458 --> 23:37.083
that we are not going to take anything from here.

23:37.500 --> 23:40.500
It’s all nothing but clay.

23:41.041 --> 23:44.375
And clay is going to remain here, and is going to vanish

23:45.125 --> 23:48.875
for ever and ever.

23:49.750 --> 23:51.999
What are we going to carry with us?

23:52.417 --> 23:55.250
What are we going to have with us?

23:55.750 --> 24:00.875
All the time it’s our evolution, is now our spirit.

24:00.875 --> 24:03.458
So we are the spirit:

24:03.875 --> 24:06.375
we are neither this nor that, nor that.

24:06.834 --> 24:08.041
What we are, we are the spirit,

24:08.709 --> 24:11.875
and we are absolutely not

24:12.291 --> 24:19.083
any way contaminated by anything that is called matter.

24:19.083 --> 24:22.375
So we should see to the essence of the Mother Earth,

24:22.792 --> 24:27.291
that the Mother Earth uses Her matter

24:27.709 --> 24:30.709
to give joy to others.

24:31.041 --> 24:40.333
In the same way if we use Her to give joy to others,

24:40.917 --> 24:44.291
then you have followed Her path.

24:44.667 --> 24:53.083
On the contrary if you try to exploit Her,

24:53.542 --> 25:01.333
it’s like making holes or digging at Her,

25:01.583 --> 25:03.709
who is your mother.

25:03.709 --> 25:06.834
If you try to separate Her into parts,

25:07.291 --> 25:13.417
that means you are cutting Her body into different parts.

25:13.999 --> 25:18.875
All these human concepts are anti-mother.

25:19.166 --> 25:23.999
But the worst, and worst of all is that

25:24.500 --> 25:28.792
we do not respect Shri Ganesha within us,

25:29.208 --> 25:32.625
which is the creation of this Mother Earth.

25:33.083 --> 25:35.792
Shri Ganesha which is the innocence within us,

25:36.291 --> 25:37.208
we do not respect.

25:37.875 --> 25:41.709
We did not respect the innocence that has come to us.

25:42.208 --> 25:46.834
The way children are tortured and butchered and abused

25:46.834 --> 25:50.041
is amazing: how people are not afraid

25:50.500 --> 25:54.375
one day a big volcano might break into a country like this,

25:54.834 --> 25:57.750
where the children are treated like this?

25:58.125 --> 26:00.417
In that case the Mother Earth will destroy

26:00.750 --> 26:03.041
all the human beings who are behaving like this,

26:03.500 --> 26:06.083
and She’ll take all such sweet children into Her lap,

26:06.625 --> 26:10.542
and She’ll reproduce them somewhere else.

26:12.583 --> 26:16.875
It is very important to understand that unless and until

26:16.875 --> 26:19.291
we respect Shri Ganesha within us,

26:19.792 --> 26:23.625
our innocence, our chastity,

26:24.291 --> 26:32.667
we cannot allow ourselves to call Sahaja yogis.

26:35.250 --> 26:38.500
That is the first beginning,

26:39.208 --> 26:45.625
the first step towards our ascent.

26:46.250 --> 26:51.917
We cannot talk of anything else, unless and until

26:52.375 --> 26:58.125
this foundation is laid in the Mother Earth.

26:58.917 --> 27:03.625
That is why today I have decided

27:04.500 --> 27:09.166
that we should have a Bhoomi Puja in England.

27:10.041 --> 27:17.625
I hope by this, innocence in this country will be respected,

27:18.083 --> 27:23.999
will be loved, will be protected and will be nourished.

27:24.542 --> 27:31.542
By this, innocence in grown-up people will be awakened,

27:31.542 --> 27:34.166
that they will respect their innocence,

27:34.542 --> 27:40.166
respect their chastity above all other things.

27:41.083 --> 27:43.792
By this Bhoomi Puja we respect

27:44.208 --> 27:45.834
the essence of the Mother Earth

27:46.333 --> 27:48.000
that is the Kundalini within us,

27:48.333 --> 27:53.375
and we respect our Self-realization by that.

27:53.375 --> 27:59.917
I hope what I am going to do today may

28:00.333 --> 28:06.041
be able to transform this country into its real form

28:06.583 --> 28:11.959
that I call as the Heart of the Universe.

28:11.959 --> 28:19.625
By this, I hope the Mother Earth will melt

28:20.041 --> 28:29.125
the stone hearts of this country into beautiful lotuses,

28:29.667 --> 28:35.959
into fragrant flowers of daises all around.

28:36.375 --> 28:37.250
May God bless you.

28:42.166 --> 28:45.166
Today’s puja is going to be very small,

28:45.709 --> 28:49.041
and we are not going to have a very long puja.

28:49.542 --> 28:53.834
It’s just going to be Shri Ganesha’s Puja,

28:54.166 --> 28:58.291
and Gauri’s Puja, it’s not going to be a very long puja.

28:58.625 --> 29:03.208
Only thing is that today with full attention,

29:03.208 --> 29:06.999
you all should sit down with left hand towards Me

29:07.291 --> 29:10.291
and right hand on the Mother Earth;

29:10.875 --> 29:13.834
on the Mother Earth, right hand on the Mother Earth.

29:14.417 --> 29:16.000
If you are sitting on the chairs,

29:16.333 --> 29:17.458
you can put the left hand towards Me

29:17.458 --> 29:20.208
and right hand towards the Mother Earth.
