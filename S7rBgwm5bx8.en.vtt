00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.792
Today we have assembled here to do the puja

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.625
of the Mother Earth.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.750
We call it as the Bhoomi Puja, Shri Dhara Puja.

00:06:39.375 --> 00:06:41.625
She’s called as Dhara.

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:45.750
As you know, “dha” means “sustain.”

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:52.083
Ra-dha – the one who sustains the energy is Radha.

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:57.125
And Dhara, which is

00:07:00.583 --> 00:07:04.375
the one which is sustenance itself,

00:07:09.041 --> 00:07:09.875
She sustains us.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.125
On Her we live.

00:07:18.125 --> 00:07:20.458
As you know,

00:07:21.333 --> 00:07:27.542
this Mother Earth is revolving with a tremendous speed,

00:07:28.834 --> 00:07:31.959
and but for Her gravity

00:07:32.542 --> 00:07:36.417
we would not have existed here.

00:07:37.125 --> 00:07:40.000
Apart from that,

00:07:40.875 --> 00:07:44.291
there is so much atmospheric pressure on Her.

00:07:50.208 --> 00:07:57.583
She understands, thinks, coordinates, and creates.

00:08:02.792 --> 00:08:07.542
This only you can find out when you are a realized soul.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:13.125
You have seen how She sucks in your negativity

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:16.083
when you are standing on Her – bare feet,

00:08:16.542 --> 00:08:17.542
respecting Her,

00:08:17.792 --> 00:08:20.834
requesting Her to suck your negativity,

00:08:21.333 --> 00:08:27.834
with a light in front of you,

00:08:30.125 --> 00:08:33.917
in front of My photograph.

00:08:34.917 --> 00:08:38.000
She knows Me,

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.959
because She’s My Mother.

00:08:44.125 --> 00:08:47.875
She’s your Grandmother, we can say;

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:53.875
that’s why She nourishes you, She looks after you.

00:08:54.834 --> 00:08:59.542
Early in the morning when we get up,

00:09:00.291 --> 00:09:02.208
when we put our foot on Her we have to say,

00:09:02.583 --> 00:09:07.333
“Oh Mother, please forgive us

00:09:07.667 --> 00:09:10.667
we are touching You with our feet.”

00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:14.125
But doesn’t matter, children can touch the mother with

00:09:14.375 --> 00:09:20.959
the feet or with the hands – makes no difference.

00:09:22.375 --> 00:09:29.834
But She is the creator of the body of Shri Ganesh.

00:09:31.417 --> 00:09:33.917
She’s the one who is represented within us

00:09:34.417 --> 00:09:36.917
as the Kundalini.

00:09:37.125 --> 00:09:44.291
She Herself moves in a spiral round the sun.

00:09:46.083 --> 00:09:49.667
The sun also moves up and down,

00:09:50.083 --> 00:09:53.333
and She moves around the sun in a spiral;

00:09:54.458 --> 00:09:57.667
but because both are relatively moving,

00:09:58.208 --> 00:10:02.000
you don’t see the movement of the sun.

00:10:08.125 --> 00:10:12.041
The relationship between the Mother Earth and all other

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:16.500
stars, planets, and constellations

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:23.667
are kept constant, unvariable with great care.

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:31.417
When we talk of materialism,

00:10:33.458 --> 00:10:38.792
we are acting against our Mother Earth.

00:10:42.333 --> 00:10:47.000
Instead of learning from Her subtler qualities,

00:10:47.583 --> 00:10:50.625
we are trying to exploit Her, to dig her out,

00:10:51.041 --> 00:10:55.250
to use Her for our selfish motives.

00:10:56.999 --> 00:11:00.083
What does She do to us?

00:11:01.041 --> 00:11:04.667
She creates these beautiful fruits for you to eat.

00:11:05.208 --> 00:11:08.542
She creates beautiful trees for you to make furniture,

00:11:08.999 --> 00:11:10.917
to make nice houses.

00:11:11.417 --> 00:11:15.959
She gives you green grass to soothe your nerves.

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:24.166
She carries so many rivers and so many huge big oceans

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:27.375
on Her being.

00:11:27.834 --> 00:11:31.834
She’s always larger than the largest of oceans.

00:11:34.083 --> 00:11:35.500
Such a great thing as She is,

00:11:36.667 --> 00:11:41.291
what do we do to Her is to exploit Her fully,

00:11:42.208 --> 00:11:44.417
indiscriminately.

00:11:44.792 --> 00:11:47.125
Then the reactions are set in.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.041
The beautiful cycle of nature is broken

00:11:50.041 --> 00:11:52.750
by our aggressive attitude,

00:11:53.959 --> 00:11:56.959
and absolutely indiscreet.

00:11:57.542 --> 00:12:02.875
Then this Mother Earth doesn’t do anything as such

00:12:03.208 --> 00:12:06.333
Herself, not much;

00:12:06.792 --> 00:12:10.000
but then the ether starts acting,

00:12:10.458 --> 00:12:16.000
and you have problems, what we call as acid rains,

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:21.000
plastic, all kinds of problems that come out of this

00:12:21.375 --> 00:12:24.583
indiscreet creation.

00:12:25.709 --> 00:12:28.291
When we started making machinery,

00:12:28.291 --> 00:12:30.500
without any balance

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.917
we started producing machinery,

00:12:37.125 --> 00:12:38.959
just like mad.

00:12:39.417 --> 00:12:40.291
As a result of that,

00:12:40.959 --> 00:12:44.625
now we have become slaves of machines.

00:12:45.083 --> 00:12:47.291
We can’t do anything with our own hands.

00:12:47.834 --> 00:12:52.166
Because of machines, people have become unemployed.

00:12:52.542 --> 00:12:56.208
As I’ve said many a times that machines are for us,

00:12:56.583 --> 00:12:58.792
we are not for the machines.

00:12:59.208 --> 00:13:01.667
But today the situation is very different.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.709
We are entirely into the hands of machines –

00:13:05.083 --> 00:13:08.375
again the same indiscreet behavior,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.458
again the same imbalances.

00:13:13.917 --> 00:13:16.583
Mother Earth teaches us balance.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.875
If She was not in a balance,

00:13:19.291 --> 00:13:21.500
we would have been all finished.

00:13:21.959 --> 00:13:23.999
She teaches us gravity.

00:13:24.417 --> 00:13:30.917
She teaches us how to be attractive to another person

00:13:31.291 --> 00:13:35.083
without the other person knowing about it,

00:13:35.417 --> 00:13:38.417
feeling about it.

00:13:40.083 --> 00:13:46.041
Without enslaving, without mesmerizing,

00:13:47.208 --> 00:13:54.166
without obliging, to attract and to give

00:13:54.583 --> 00:13:57.250
without expectations.

00:13:57.625 --> 00:14:00.709
Without any expectations She gives us;

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.834
whether we respect Her not,

00:14:03.125 --> 00:14:04.917
whether we’ll treat Her not,

00:14:05.208 --> 00:14:06.333
we give Her.

00:14:07.041 --> 00:14:12.959
But when She gets very upset, like as in –

00:14:14.125 --> 00:14:19.959
you have heard that in Mexico She erupted out.

00:14:20.208 --> 00:14:21.542
You know what was happening in Mexico,

00:14:21.542 --> 00:14:23.291
I was telling you long time back,

00:14:24.041 --> 00:14:27.208
that they are using all kinds of black magic,

00:14:27.999 --> 00:14:31.333
they are producing all kinds of drugs.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.542
Colombia is doing the same.

00:14:36.417 --> 00:14:39.458
And if you do all these things to harm people,

00:14:39.875 --> 00:14:45.083
then She gets into volcanic conditions,

00:14:45.709 --> 00:14:49.709
and then a volcano starts bursting out.

00:14:51.333 --> 00:14:56.959
As you know, Los Angeles and all these places

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.250
on the western coast of America

00:14:59.625 --> 00:15:03.125
are still in the danger of volcanoes.

00:15:03.583 --> 00:15:05.999
All kinds of gurus have gone and settled there,

00:15:06.375 --> 00:15:07.999
all kinds of black magic is on.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:12.375
There is witchcraft which is officially recognized.

00:15:12.875 --> 00:15:14.792
Officially they are registered.

00:15:14.792 --> 00:15:17.125
Nobody minds doing anything,

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.417
because they say you have human freedom

00:15:19.875 --> 00:15:22.875
to do all kinds of devilish things.

00:15:23.166 --> 00:15:26.083
Under the name of human freedom they are doing

00:15:26.417 --> 00:15:27.959
all kinds of horrible things.

00:15:28.291 --> 00:15:31.083
As a result of that, Mother takes the respite.

00:15:31.333 --> 00:15:34.333
It is always a collective respite.

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:38.291
It is always a collective respite, please remember this.

00:15:38.583 --> 00:15:44.000
But when Sita wanted to leave Shri Rama,

00:15:44.542 --> 00:15:48.125
She opened Herself and took Her inside Herself.

00:15:48.834 --> 00:15:51.208
That is a reception of the Mother,

00:15:51.583 --> 00:15:54.792
that is not the destruction or eruption.

00:15:55.208 --> 00:15:58.709
But the eruption harms collectively, and sometimes

00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:03.417
some innocent people are also killed in that.

00:16:09.291 --> 00:16:14.083
Death does not exist, in the divine language.

00:16:14.625 --> 00:16:17.166
Those who are dead can be reborn.

00:16:17.667 --> 00:16:22.417
But death sometimes could be used for punishing people,

00:16:25.333 --> 00:16:30.917
for destroying them, for taking them away from the scene.

00:16:31.375 --> 00:16:33.500
That’s what the Mother Earth does.

00:16:33.959 --> 00:16:43.125
Sometimes Her anger can be so great that pin-pointedly

00:16:43.458 --> 00:16:45.083
She can destroy

00:16:46.125 --> 00:16:50.083
thousands and thousands of miles of earth,

00:16:50.834 --> 00:16:56.375
destroying many people who have been extremely

00:16:56.959 --> 00:17:00.500
irreligious and uncollective.

00:17:01.041 --> 00:17:02.750
In Sahaja Yoga also,

00:17:03.291 --> 00:17:05.041
those people who are uncollective,

00:17:05.417 --> 00:17:09.166
try to be uncollective, are harmed by Her;

00:17:09.166 --> 00:17:13.458
but in a very secretive way

00:17:14.125 --> 00:17:16.625
which they must understand,

00:17:17.041 --> 00:17:20.291
or we should say, in a very subtle way.

00:17:21.166 --> 00:17:24.875
When Sahaja yogis become uncollective, saying,

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:29.999
“This is my house, my home, this is my privacy.

00:17:30.291 --> 00:17:34.041
This is my wife, my child, my things.

00:17:34.333 --> 00:17:38.792
I cannot come to puja because I have got this problem.

00:17:39.083 --> 00:17:41.458
I cannot do this work for Sahaja Yoga because I’ve got

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:46.959
that problem” – when they become uncollective,

00:17:47.333 --> 00:17:50.709
then in a very subtle way this Mother Earth,

00:17:51.041 --> 00:17:54.375
which is represented within us as the Kundalini,

00:17:54.792 --> 00:17:57.125
gets upset.

00:17:57.709 --> 00:18:03.166
And when She gets upset, She starts acting in a manner

00:18:03.999 --> 00:18:09.208
which can be very dangerous for people.

00:18:10.625 --> 00:18:14.999
Possessiveness is not the quality of Mother Earth,

00:18:15.417 --> 00:18:17.875
She doesn’t possess anyone.

00:18:17.875 --> 00:18:20.999
For example, if you are an Indian

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:23.875
you can come to England, you can go anywhere,

00:18:24.083 --> 00:18:25.500
you can live anywhere.

00:18:25.999 --> 00:18:27.834
She doesn’t possess anyone as such;

00:18:28.208 --> 00:18:32.834
we only the human beings have made this world into

00:18:33.166 --> 00:18:35.166
different countries, different places –

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:39.000
all our own ideas of stupidity.

00:18:40.041 --> 00:18:42.041
There’s only one world,

00:18:42.417 --> 00:18:45.041
there’s only one world God has created.

00:18:45.041 --> 00:18:46.625
He has not created …

00:18:47.083 --> 00:18:51.333
It’s rather awkward here. Allright now better.

00:19:09.208 --> 00:19:13.333
She has not created all these nations.

00:19:13.333 --> 00:19:16.625
Only there are ravines

00:19:17.542 --> 00:19:22.333
through which big rivers flow.

00:19:22.792 --> 00:19:26.208
Sometimes, wherever She has raised Herself,

00:19:26.959 --> 00:19:29.375
there are mountains.

00:19:29.792 --> 00:19:34.041
These are Her different dulations and different varieties,

00:19:34.458 --> 00:19:36.375
just to create beauty.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.834
Supposing the whole world was like a bald-headed

00:19:40.417 --> 00:19:44.709
gentleman, what would have happened to us?

00:19:44.709 --> 00:19:49.750
First of all, we all would have slipped out, I think!

00:19:50.375 --> 00:19:53.542
Or else, what would have happened

00:19:53.999 --> 00:19:58.417
if it was nothing but just all over the forest,

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:01.625
or all over only the mountains,

00:20:01.999 --> 00:20:04.792
or all over just the rivers?

00:20:08.834 --> 00:20:13.500
To create the beauty She has used all these things

00:20:13.834 --> 00:20:20.999
to make us happy, to give us joy, to entertain us.

00:20:21.291 --> 00:20:24.792
She created all this beautiful stage for us.

00:20:25.208 --> 00:20:26.875
And what do we do?

00:20:27.291 --> 00:20:29.999
We have divided Her into parts,

00:20:30.208 --> 00:20:32.917
that this is my country,

00:20:33.333 --> 00:20:38.125
this is your country, this is their country.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.458
When we die, what is our country?

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.875
We are all dead bodies,

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.542
whether you are buried in a church or in the open,

00:20:51.999 --> 00:20:54.083
you are all in the Mother Earth.

00:20:54.417 --> 00:21:00.000
What is our country is that we are the Mother Earth.

00:21:00.542 --> 00:21:03.667
So we have to understand that this body is made

00:21:04.083 --> 00:21:06.709
out of that Mother Earth to which it has to go,

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.125
and we are stupid to feel that we belong to this country

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.250
or to that country.

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:15.999
Of course, this is the greatest miracle of the maya,

00:21:16.458 --> 00:21:17.542
that people know this

00:21:18.083 --> 00:21:20.667
but still they do not want to believe it.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.917
There are so many truths they know:

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:25.542
they are sure, they know about it,

00:21:25.999 --> 00:21:28.000
but they don’t want to believe it.

00:21:28.458 --> 00:21:31.333
Or they believe it, but they don’t want to accept it.

00:21:31.667 --> 00:21:32.959
And even if they accept it,

00:21:33.333 --> 00:21:36.000
they don’t want to know about it.

00:21:36.417 --> 00:21:40.583
It’s a funny human miracle that they know

00:21:41.083 --> 00:21:43.333
that nothing belongs to us.

00:21:43.792 --> 00:21:46.667
When we come on this Earth our hands are like this;

00:21:47.125 --> 00:21:50.083
when we go, everything is like this.

00:21:50.083 --> 00:21:53.500
Despite that, despite this understanding

00:21:53.917 --> 00:21:58.125
we still play games with ourselves, cheat ourselves,

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.625
and try to believe that I am this country,

00:22:00.875 --> 00:22:05.834
I am that country, I am so great, and so that.

00:22:05.834 --> 00:22:10.709
But human beings were born in certain countries

00:22:11.208 --> 00:22:13.792
earlier than in other countries.

00:22:14.208 --> 00:22:17.000
That has definitely made difference to the tradition and

00:22:17.333 --> 00:22:20.917
understanding of life, that is human life.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:25.291
Earth remains the same, but this changes.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.959
The climate may be different,

00:22:29.291 --> 00:22:32.166
that’s why the fruits may be different.

00:22:32.667 --> 00:22:34.500
It’s all an adjustment.

00:22:34.834 --> 00:22:38.208
In the whole plan there is such a good adjustment,

00:22:38.625 --> 00:22:42.333
no quarrel, no problem; it’s just a variety again.

00:22:42.333 --> 00:22:46.208
Supposing all bananas are produced all over the world,

00:22:46.667 --> 00:22:47.625
who would care for them?

00:22:48.083 --> 00:22:50.417
For example, if you give bananas to Indians,

00:22:50.792 --> 00:22:54.083
they will laugh at it. But if you give them apples,

00:22:54.458 --> 00:22:58.333
they’ll say, “Oh, apples, wait!”

00:22:58.792 --> 00:23:01.125
The other way round for the English:

00:23:01.375 --> 00:23:03.458
if you want to give somebody present as an apple,

00:23:03.792 --> 00:23:09.375
they’ll look at you, “What’s the matter with this person?”

00:23:11.083 --> 00:23:15.333
So this is again Her own style of playing

00:23:16.041 --> 00:23:17.917
and giving you different type of climates,

00:23:18.208 --> 00:23:19.792
different type of produces,

00:23:20.166 --> 00:23:21.667
so that you enjoy different things.

00:23:22.208 --> 00:23:25.417
If there is no variety, then you won’t be able to enjoy it.

00:23:25.834 --> 00:23:27.125
How much She understand you,

00:23:27.458 --> 00:23:30.667
and how much do we understand Her?

00:23:31.333 --> 00:23:34.000
For a Sahaja yogi it is important to understand

00:23:34.458 --> 00:23:37.083
that we are not going to take anything from here.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.500
It’s all nothing but clay.

00:23:41.041 --> 00:23:44.375
And clay is going to remain here, and is going to vanish

00:23:45.125 --> 00:23:48.875
for ever and ever.

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:51.999
What are we going to carry with us?

00:23:52.417 --> 00:23:55.250
What are we going to have with us?

00:23:55.750 --> 00:24:00.875
All the time it’s our evolution, is now our spirit.

00:24:00.875 --> 00:24:03.458
So we are the spirit:

00:24:03.875 --> 00:24:06.375
we are neither this nor that, nor that.

00:24:06.834 --> 00:24:08.041
What we are, we are the spirit,

00:24:08.709 --> 00:24:11.875
and we are absolutely not

00:24:12.291 --> 00:24:19.083
any way contaminated by anything that is called matter.

00:24:19.083 --> 00:24:22.375
So we should see to the essence of the Mother Earth,

00:24:22.792 --> 00:24:27.291
that the Mother Earth uses Her matter

00:24:27.709 --> 00:24:30.709
to give joy to others.

00:24:31.041 --> 00:24:40.333
In the same way if we use Her to give joy to others,

00:24:40.917 --> 00:24:44.291
then you have followed Her path.

00:24:44.667 --> 00:24:53.083
On the contrary if you try to exploit Her,

00:24:53.542 --> 00:25:01.333
it’s like making holes or digging at Her,

00:25:01.583 --> 00:25:03.709
who is your mother.

00:25:03.709 --> 00:25:06.834
If you try to separate Her into parts,

00:25:07.291 --> 00:25:13.417
that means you are cutting Her body into different parts.

00:25:13.999 --> 00:25:18.875
All these human concepts are anti-mother.

00:25:19.166 --> 00:25:23.999
But the worst, and worst of all is that

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:28.792
we do not respect Shri Ganesha within us,

00:25:29.208 --> 00:25:32.625
which is the creation of this Mother Earth.

00:25:33.083 --> 00:25:35.792
Shri Ganesha which is the innocence within us,

00:25:36.291 --> 00:25:37.208
we do not respect.

00:25:37.875 --> 00:25:41.709
We did not respect the innocence that has come to us.

00:25:42.208 --> 00:25:46.834
The way children are tortured and butchered and abused

00:25:46.834 --> 00:25:50.041
is amazing: how people are not afraid

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:54.375
one day a big volcano might break into a country like this,

00:25:54.834 --> 00:25:57.750
where the children are treated like this?

00:25:58.125 --> 00:26:00.417
In that case the Mother Earth will destroy

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:03.041
all the human beings who are behaving like this,

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.083
and She’ll take all such sweet children into Her lap,

00:26:06.625 --> 00:26:10.542
and She’ll reproduce them somewhere else.

00:26:12.583 --> 00:26:16.875
It is very important to understand that unless and until

00:26:16.875 --> 00:26:19.291
we respect Shri Ganesha within us,

00:26:19.792 --> 00:26:23.625
our innocence, our chastity,

00:26:24.291 --> 00:26:32.667
we cannot allow ourselves to call Sahaja yogis.

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:38.500
That is the first beginning,

00:26:39.208 --> 00:26:45.625
the first step towards our ascent.

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:51.917
We cannot talk of anything else, unless and until

00:26:52.375 --> 00:26:58.125
this foundation is laid in the Mother Earth.

00:26:58.917 --> 00:27:03.625
That is why today I have decided

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:09.166
that we should have a Bhoomi Puja in England.

00:27:10.041 --> 00:27:17.625
I hope by this, innocence in this country will be respected,

00:27:18.083 --> 00:27:23.999
will be loved, will be protected and will be nourished.

00:27:24.542 --> 00:27:31.542
By this, innocence in grown-up people will be awakened,

00:27:31.542 --> 00:27:34.166
that they will respect their innocence,

00:27:34.542 --> 00:27:40.166
respect their chastity above all other things.

00:27:41.083 --> 00:27:43.792
By this Bhoomi Puja we respect

00:27:44.208 --> 00:27:45.834
the essence of the Mother Earth

00:27:46.333 --> 00:27:48.000
that is the Kundalini within us,

00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:53.375
and we respect our Self-realization by that.

00:27:53.375 --> 00:27:59.917
I hope what I am going to do today may

00:28:00.333 --> 00:28:06.041
be able to transform this country into its real form

00:28:06.583 --> 00:28:11.959
that I call as the Heart of the Universe.

00:28:11.959 --> 00:28:19.625
By this, I hope the Mother Earth will melt

00:28:20.041 --> 00:28:29.125
the stone hearts of this country into beautiful lotuses,

00:28:29.667 --> 00:28:35.959
into fragrant flowers of daises all around.

00:28:36.375 --> 00:28:37.250
May God bless you.

00:28:42.166 --> 00:28:45.166
Today’s puja is going to be very small,

00:28:45.709 --> 00:28:49.041
and we are not going to have a very long puja.

00:28:49.542 --> 00:28:53.834
It’s just going to be Shri Ganesha’s Puja,

00:28:54.166 --> 00:28:58.291
and Gauri’s Puja, it’s not going to be a very long puja.

00:28:58.625 --> 00:29:03.208
Only thing is that today with full attention,

00:29:03.208 --> 00:29:06.999
you all should sit down with left hand towards Me

00:29:07.291 --> 00:29:10.291
and right hand on the Mother Earth;

00:29:10.875 --> 00:29:13.834
on the Mother Earth, right hand on the Mother Earth.

00:29:14.417 --> 00:29:16.000
If you are sitting on the chairs,

00:29:16.333 --> 00:29:17.458
you can put the left hand towards Me

00:29:17.458 --> 00:29:20.208
and right hand towards the Mother Earth.
