00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:14.730
Today is the first day, New Year's Day, according
to the Shalivahana Calendar, who were My forefathers.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:22.860
And in the whole of Maharashtra, it is regarded
as the New Year Day and the best day to start

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.940
anything.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:32.680
So today I've decided to have Mahamaya Puja.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:45.590
I have never talked about Mahamaya, as it
is not to be talked or told - it's a secret,

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.750
as they say.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:01:00.260
It's the basic of Sahaja Yoga, I should say,
because it's described, when the Goddess comes

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:09.220
in the Sahasrara, the Shakti, She is Mahamaya
- "Sahasrare Mahamaya," already described.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:18.260
She has to be the Mahamaya, means She should
camouflage Herself fully.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:28.410
Nobody should be able to know Her as the Goddess,
to begin with; and even if they get Realization,

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:35.759
they should not reach to the end of it.

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.120
There are many reasons for that.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.562
The first thing: the job.

00:01:40.562 --> 00:01:44.350
The job of Mahamaya was to give Realization.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:52.560
Now, if I had come on a tiger with a sword
in My hand, nobody would have stood near Me.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.070
You all would have run away from Me.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:04.990
In any other form, if the Goddess had come,
She could not have done what She was supposed

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.180
to do.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:15.059
Moreover, only if She had come as the Mother
of Christ, or Shri Sitaji, or you can say

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:18.680
Fatima - they all ended their lives.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.739
They had to go away from this world so early,
I mean.

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.730
They couldn't do any work whatsoever.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:36.540
Now this work, difficult work of giving Realization
to others, is very intricate.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:46.069
It has to work out in such a manner that nobody
feels that it is done by some great personality

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.519
or with a great awe or fear.

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:58.849
So the Mahamaya Incarnation has to come, that
people can come closer.

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:12.049
Also, it has one advantage, very great advantages,
that when a simple person who's just a housewife

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:17.409
starts giving Realization, people are flabbergasted.

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:21.489
Also they think, "If She can do it, why not
we do it?

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.669
After all, She's just an ordinary housewife.

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:26.489
So, it's all right.

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.199
If She can do something, we can also do it."

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:38.949
So they have self-confidence, you see, and,
being a Mother, She does Her loving part,

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:42.680
Her compassion, but the greatest is the patience.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.590
You see, none of them had so much patience,
all these Incarnations who came.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:55.849
You see how they disappeared from this Mother
Earth quickly, I'd say, by some excuse or

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:56.849
other.

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:04.739
But I had to stay, I don't know how long,
but it has to be done up to a point, this

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.779
work of giving Realization.

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:19.870
The third thing was that you have to be identified
into My Body, into My cells of My Body, but

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:29.030
this is a more difficult task because supposing
one of you becomes stupid, becomes foolish,

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.560
quarrelsome.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.300
Anything you do, any small thing, it hurts
Me.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.400
It has to, but I don't think about Myself.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.750
I always think about you.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.289
So it's an indication to Me that something
has gone wrong somewhere.

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.050
Somebody is doing something wrong to somebody.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.970
Some Sahaja Yogis are being tortured.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.819
Some are sick.

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:58.139
Anything like that, I work it out very intensely
and intimately.

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:04.180
Recently, today only, they told Me somebody
has got meningitis in Australia.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.740
Immediately, I gave bandhan.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:14.970
I'm sure such a person should be cured if
she has any faith in Me and she's in My being.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.680
Or somebody is ill somewhere, they tell Me
and such a person is saved.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.250
They call it a miracle.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.199
It is not a miracle.

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.810
It's not a miracle.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.240
It's again the Mahamaya's blessings are like
this.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.590
You can't see how you are inside Me.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.520
You can't see your reflection within Me.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.520
You can't see.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.919
This is Mahamaya.

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:42.770
This is the secret part of it, that you don't
know; and then when I feel the pain and if

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:48.090
I try, look at it, because I have power to
cures, so you get cured.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.509
You don't know how it happens.

00:05:53.509 --> 00:06:14.479
Collectively, whatever you feel, I get it
in My Body.

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:22.139
For example, collectively, if you have a left
Vishuddhi, I get it.

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:28.180
If you have, say, right Vishuddhi, I get it.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:37.229
Any Chakra that you catch, collectively, I
get that problem and I have to solve it because

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:39.870
it troubles Me, so I solve it.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.879
It's a compulsion that I have to solve it.

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:48.590
Now in doing so, you see, you might think,
"Mother, we are troubling."

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:49.729
You are not.

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:51.379
It's My doing.

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:54.469
I have taken you into Myself.

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:56.930
You haven't.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.279
So you don't have to worry as to, as if you
are troubling Me.

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:01.279
It's My own doing.

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:02.500
It's My own work.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.500
It's My own responsibility.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.370
And if I have done it, it's done it because
I am supposed to do it.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:12.389
That's the job I have to do.

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:15.580
So there's nothing to feel bad about it.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.139
But now, what is the purpose?

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:29.190
As I told you, is that I could come close
to you and I need not, sort of, fill you with

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:36.409
fear or awedness, or even a feeling that I
am not a human being.

00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:41.620
I behave exactly like human being, I react
exactly like human beings and all these powers

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.810
are hidden within Myself.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:47.870
Unless and until you are a realized soul,
you won't understand.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.659
Whatever you may do, you won't understand.

00:07:49.659 --> 00:07:55.830
Or maybe in the previous life you had your
Realization, or maybe also you have done such

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:59.090
tremendous punyas that you can recognize.

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:03.830
There are people like that who have done it.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:15.490
But to make it more, sort of, congenial to
you is to become absolutely a human being.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:21.120
So I married, I have children, I have grandchildren
and I do shopping, as you see.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.800
People are surprised how I take Coca-Cola.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.680
I'm not supposed to take Coca-Cola!

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.879
Or I eat popcorn.

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:31.490
They're surprised.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.810
But I have to be just like you.

00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:37.470
But inside I am not.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:38.470
Outside I am.

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:48.240
You see, My attention is such that it penetrates
into everything, and I remember each and every

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.250
thing very well.

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.820
My memory's very good, even at this age.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:09:00.029
So, you see, this attention itself is very
penetrating, and when it penetrates it carries

00:09:00.029 --> 00:09:05.310
with it all the powers that are required,
and acts.

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:11.950
It's a tremendous machinery, I should say,
which is very subtle and works wonders.

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:17.010
So you start telling Me that there is a miracle
that has happened, miracle that has happened.

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:24.510
Nothing is a miracle because if you're all
in My Body and if My Body is divine, then

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:25.529
what is a miracle?

00:09:25.529 --> 00:09:30.389
It's all the communication, as this hand can
communicate with this hand, I communicate

00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:31.730
with you.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:40.800
But one thing is definite, that you should
not get lost with this rupa of Mahamaya.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.709
It's a very dangerous thing because once you
get lost, "Oh, Mother!

00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:50.900
After all" - you see, like that - then it
doesn't act, it doesn't work out.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:59.550
It's not a casual thing, but I want to live
very casually Myself to show that I'm casual,

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:01.180
but I am not.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:07.830
While you should not pay your attention casually,
that won't work out because you are in My

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:08.830
Body.

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:18.370
Say, every cell in My Body is aware, and every
cell has a reflector.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:22.519
I don't know about, you know about it, but
there is a reflector in us, which works on

00:10:22.519 --> 00:10:24.839
remote control.

00:10:24.839 --> 00:10:28.200
So it works on remote control on your attention
also.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.110
If your attention is not all right, it corrects.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:35.779
It puts you - that's the best way we could
evolve human beings.

00:10:35.779 --> 00:10:43.900
There was no other way out, because the attention
of the people is, on the whole, in the whole

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.100
world, is not yet on the Spirit.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:51.160
But suddenly, they get a glimpse that there
must be something beyond.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.139
So many religions have come, so many have
talked about it.

00:10:54.139 --> 00:11:02.040
So, they may say about it, they may talk about
it, but still the consciousness that we have

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:07.519
to be the Spirit is among very few people
and they are the ones called as the seekers

00:11:07.519 --> 00:11:10.449
of truth, while the rest of the people are
not.

00:11:10.449 --> 00:11:11.779
They are busy with this or that.

00:11:11.779 --> 00:11:12.779
"Oh, I'm very happy.

00:11:12.779 --> 00:11:14.001
I'm very happy with myself.

00:11:14.001 --> 00:11:15.959
You enjoy your holiday.

00:11:15.959 --> 00:11:18.579
I'll enjoy my holiday."

00:11:18.579 --> 00:11:21.009
Like that they talk.

00:11:21.009 --> 00:11:28.579
So under these circumstances, one had to come
in a camouflage, enter into like - you see,

00:11:28.579 --> 00:11:34.290
they are like enemies, I would say, enemies
of God's Love.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:40.620
So you have to enter into them like a spy,
camouflaging yourself, you see, and make them

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.389
dance here, here and there.

00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:45.620
Let them get lost a little bit here and there.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:51.580
Let them see for themselves because with Mahamaya,
you see, She allows you.

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:56.640
Now, there are some Sahaja Yogis who left
Sahaja Yoga, went off.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:01.050
I said, "All right, if they have gone, very
good.

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:03.279
Good riddance of bad rubbish.

00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:04.279
Doesn't matter."

00:12:04.279 --> 00:12:05.820
And then they again come back.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.930
"Mother, this happened to us.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:09.470
That happened to us.

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:10.550
Somebody got this.

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:11.550
Somebody got that.

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:15.820
We met with an accident, then somebody got
the sickness.

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.620
Somebody is very unhappy.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.690
We broke our marriage."

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:32.709
All kinds of things and when they say like
this, I mean, they do like this, I just smile.

00:12:32.709 --> 00:12:34.139
So it's a bad coin.

00:12:34.139 --> 00:12:35.520
All right, doesn't matter.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:41.720
Again they come back to Sahaja Yoga, but they
are left behind than others.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:46.820
They come up, but slowly, because they have
suffered, so they have come.

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:52.940
In a way, there's a good example for others
that we don't want to suffer any more.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:59.420
The sufferings do not come from Mahamaya,
by any chance.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:13.720
On the contrary, once you have called Me the
Mother, you see, there is a protective attention

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.290
on you.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:24.350
Then you misbehave, you cross all the limits
and things, then it acts on you.

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:29.720
This action has taken place in many cases.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:35.970
Some of them have come back, some are still
hanging around and are doing wrong things,

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:40.509
because they have done terribly wrong things
and they know they'll be found out.

00:13:40.509 --> 00:13:45.199
Now the worst thing that happens in Sahaja
Yoga that people try to make money out of

00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:52.139
Me because they know I don't understand money,
I don't understand banking and I'm very bad

00:13:52.139 --> 00:13:58.610
at it; but I'm not.

00:13:58.610 --> 00:13:59.610
I know everything.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:00.610
I know everything about everyone.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:01.800
They tell me lies.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.620
I know that they're telling Me lies, but is
allowed.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.759
Do what you like in Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:08.759 --> 00:14:12.440
You, yourself, will have to pay for it.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:18.949
It's something so great with this Mahamaya
rup, that, directly, I don't have to say anything.

00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:21.019
You don't even know that it's done.

00:14:21.019 --> 00:14:24.129
When it happens, they come rushing to Me,
"Mother, it has happened."

00:14:24.129 --> 00:14:31.819
Now, I have not done anything directly, neither
indirectly, but once you go out of the protection

00:14:31.819 --> 00:14:37.579
of your Mother, there are all negative forces
all around you, which also you don't see because

00:14:37.579 --> 00:14:39.100
you are partly blind.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:43.200
You couldn't see your Mother and you couldn't
see these negative forces also.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:49.199
Then you fall a prey to their talk, things,
whatever it is, or maybe into some paradoxical

00:14:49.199 --> 00:14:50.699
culture, as you have here.

00:14:50.699 --> 00:14:53.139
You may fall a prey to that.

00:14:53.139 --> 00:14:58.279
There's somebody I know in Sahaja Yoga who
has gone now and he's now drinking a lot and

00:14:58.279 --> 00:15:02.399
he's doing all kinds of things.

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:08.319
So such a person gets lost because of his
doings.

00:15:08.319 --> 00:15:11.019
I am not doing anything to him.

00:15:11.019 --> 00:15:16.009
If you are with Me, if you are in Sahaja Yoga,
you are protected, you are looked after.

00:15:16.009 --> 00:15:21.480
But you have to stick on, you have to have
faith and even if there's any problem, it

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.480
gets solved.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:29.470
But those who have gone out of it, who go
beyond My reach, then they suffer.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:35.519
So, even indirectly, I would say, I'm not
in any way harming them because I've decided

00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:37.819
not to harm anyone.

00:15:37.819 --> 00:15:39.180
That I have decided on.

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:43.000
Especially those who call Me "Mother", I don't
want to harm them.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000
But they get harmed.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.589
No doubt, they get harmed very badly.

00:15:46.589 --> 00:15:51.889
So, if it has happened, just take it up, "All
right, doesn't matter.

00:15:51.889 --> 00:15:52.959
Mother forgives everyone.

00:15:52.959 --> 00:15:54.060
It has happened, has happened.

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.370
This is a lesson for me.

00:15:56.370 --> 00:16:01.199
It was something because of it happened and
now I'm back."

00:16:01.199 --> 00:16:07.800
And then you become sometimes a better Sahaja
Yogi than many of them.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:17.310
This kind of happening is very common in every
country.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:21.650
But you see, this whole culture, I feel, is
so paradoxical.

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:28.850
Whole culture is so paradoxical, and what
is paid for is something that is ugly.

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:33.480
What is paid for is something that is sinful.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:38.110
Whatever that is filthy, dirty is paid for
and accepted.

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:44.520
It's very paradoxical because it goes against
growth of spirituality.

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:48.740
One side, you are spiritual, you want to be
spiritual.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:54.689
Another side you have this paradoxical culture,
which takes you down to hell.

00:16:54.689 --> 00:16:58.850
It's like a story once Babamama told Me.

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:02.330
Very interesting story it is.

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:09.740
He said that some people did lots of punyas,
so they were taken to heaven, but they saw

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.460
everybody was meditating, nicely enjoying.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.110
He said, "What is this?

00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:15.420
We did this also with Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.500
What's the use of doing it here again?

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.950
We should have something else, so let's have
a look at the hell."

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:27.910
So they went down to see the hell and outside
they were having all these paradoxical culture

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:31.880
of nude women and nude men dancing, shouting,
screaming.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.330
Dirty, filthy things going on there.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:39.430
So they said, "This seems to be different,
you know."

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:43.750
So the people who were doing all these acts,
they asked, "Why are you here?"

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:48.420
They said, "We've come here only for seeing
the hell."

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.810
"Oh, all right.

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:50.810
There are peepholes.

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:51.810
You see through them."

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:55.480
So they had big, big holes, out of which they
started seeing.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:18:04.070
So in one hole they saw people being put into
some sort of a filth, a pus and this and that.

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:05.780
Another into feces, this, that.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:13.140
Another into a sort of a mire out of which
they could not come out, shouting.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:18.700
Then there's another one where they were boiled
in the boiling oil and some were beaten up.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:22.410
There were snakes and scorpions and this and
that.

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:24.330
They said, "What is this all?"

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.210
"That is hell you wanted to see.

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:27.210
That is hell.

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:28.370
You want to go, you can go there."

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:32.820
So they said, "What are you doing here?"

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.760
"This is publicity department.

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.740
For hell."

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:47.390
They ran back to heaven and asked forgiveness
that "We don't want, we don't want this hell,

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:49.750
had enough of it."

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:53.160
So, like that, you see, the whole world is
a camouflage.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:19:02.070
If you see, this is an anti-Mahamaya.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:06.980
So they say that this maya is created by God.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.350
No.

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:15.260
Maya that God has created is this world, this
whole universe and all that.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:19.350
But this illusive life is created by human
beings.

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:25.930
Absolutely, through their projections of their
brains and mental capacities, they have projected

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:28.640
because money is everything.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:33.290
If money is everything, by hook or crook,
if you have to get the money, then do what

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:34.290
you like.

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:39.380
And every day you read in the newspaper, I
mean horrible stories about how people want

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:44.310
to make money, how they want to sell their
daughters, how they want to sell their wives.

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:47.690
Anything is all right as long as you have
money.

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:50.420
If you can make money, nothing matters.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:20:01.190
So this is one of the illusions that human
beings have created is what you call is "money

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:07.410
maya" and, in that, comes also the wealth,
possessions, materialism.

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:16.300
Everything is created by human beings, and
this creation of materialism then boils you

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:25.770
down to a personality which is involved in
all sinful act.

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:30.400
Everything is all right because if money is
all right, materialism is all right.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:39.720
For example, the way people went down to America
- Spanish - and killed so many aboriginals

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:40.720
there.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:46.930
Then also English went and all kinds of people
went there in America.

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:54.140
The way they have tortured is something, is
you cannot think how human beings can behave

00:20:54.140 --> 00:21:04.010
like this towards ordinary people, who are
just simple people living in the jungles.

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:12.080
How can you do such a thing to them, such
horrible, you can call it a genocide?

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:15.950
It's really a terrible thing, they did it.

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:22.540
We know more about these Germans, the way
they behaved recently, but even in those days

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:25.110
they used to do all kinds of things.

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:30.500
And the nature, which is a Maya of God, which
how it takes respite.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:38.380
There were people in America, Central America,
near River Mississippi in Missouri.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.290
They're called as rednecks long time.

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:43.910
He must be remembering this.

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:49.660
And because they were called rednecks by the
blacks, they used to kill so many blacks,

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:55.860
they used to hang their children on the tree,
they used to throw their bodies in the river,

00:21:55.860 --> 00:22:03.640
sometimes get them drowned; did all kinds
of things to the black people, under the name

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:09.370
that they were white people and they're superior
and something like that, behaving worse than

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:10.900
animals.

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:20.170
Now you know, there, floods came in, terrible
floods came in and those floods drowned these

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:26.040
rednecks beyond their necks and so many were
dead.

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.630
One would say that "How could it happen?"

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:29.630
It is.

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:36.570
Another example I'll give you is the, you
see, the way Americans were treating all these

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:44.840
Bolivians and the Colombians, that they would
buy everything from them very cheaply, and

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.890
like wheat and everything, very cheap.

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:54.280
Just the minimum profits they had, and they
would sell it at a double price and make money.

00:22:54.280 --> 00:23:03.090
All this was really criminal to do from any
point of view, but they were doing it.

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:11.490
I went to - I don't know what year it was,
1978 or so - into Colombia and there was one

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:12.660
man came in the party.

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:13.660
I was with My husband.

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:17.700
He said, "I've heard You are a great, saintly
person from India.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:23.710
Can You give us some blessings that we really
hit these Americans nicely and see them off?

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:31.310
Because the way they are exposing us to our
poverty and things, they're horrible."

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:34.960
I said, "Why do you want to hit them?"

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.890
"No, they require it, otherwise they'll not
be all right."

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:38.060
I was just in the party.

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:39.700
I didn't want to discuss it.

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:40.700
"All right."

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:46.240
And, you know, this cocaine came up there.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:51.300
And if you go and see now that place - I've
been to, Bogota, with My husband - it was

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:57.370
like a shanty town, absolutely like a shanty
town, made of tin and this and that.

00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:02.150
Now, big, big buildings are there, and you
have escalators and everything.

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:06.970
They used to bring petroleum with the donkey's
cart.

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:09.150
Can you imagine?

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:15.620
In such a short time it has become such a
big country and not only that, but now the

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:20.940
whole America is afraid of them, even Australia.

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:25.390
The drugs are taken by Americans themselves.

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:33.500
In Washington there is such a lot of storage
of drugs that they don't know what to do,

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.130
and even the senators are taking to drugs.

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:37.130
Can you imagine?

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:42.160
I wouldn't be surprised one day Mr. Clinton
lands up with some drugs.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:47.020
The way it is such a fashion, it is such a
fantastic thing for them.

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:52.380
You go to any party of elite people, which
I have to some time, they only talk about

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:53.380
drugs, you see.

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:54.380
"You want?

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:56.060
Which drug do you like?"

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.820
I said, "I don't like any drug."

00:24:57.820 --> 00:24:58.820
"No.

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:01.870
If you want, you can get it cheaply in this,
you know, if you go there and get it there."

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:03.830
They discuss it in the elite parties.

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:08.730
Also about gurus, you see, which guru you
want.

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:11.560
"There is a sale on of a such-and-such guru.

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.580
On a bargain you can go."

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:14.580
Like that.

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:16.760
You know, it's all so stupid, I tell you.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:20.650
I said, "These people are so immature, worse
than children."

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:24.110
They are not grown up, only in age.

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:31.530
They have done good maybe in mechanism and
all those things, but that has nothing to

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:39.930
do with your personality growth, and that's
why I find them just like dwarves the way

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:42.470
they have attitude towards things.

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:50.890
And everyone practically must have taken drugs,
everybody except for Asians may not have,

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:56.790
because now I have learnt that there are two
genes which protect the Asians, but the white

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:59.080
skin has not those genes which are to protect.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:04.910
The other day in the lecture I told them that
there are two genes which are protective,

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:08.260
found only among Asians, means Chinese and
Indians.

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:12.880
All the rest of the people don't have those
genes, which should protect them.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:19.280
So they are so vulnerable to all these nonsensical
things that are going on, and they take to

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.280
it so easily.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:25.800
I used to wonder how these educated, good
people, I mean people of My husband's ranking

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.180
also were stupid like that.

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.310
Every time they would bring a new wife.

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:36.350
One day they brought, one of them, brought
a wife who was hardly about twenty years of

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:37.350
age.

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:38.940
This fellow is at least seventy.

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:39.940
I didn't know.

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:40.940
My husband pinched Me.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:43.040
He said, "That's his wife.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.040
All right?

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.020
Don't call her a grand-daughter."

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:51.490
I used to drop bricks after bricks there.

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:56.980
Such absurd people coming, and a seventy-year-old
man coming with a lady who's twenty years.

00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:01.390
I mean, you can never think that she could
be his wife.

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:05.760
At the most a sister-in-law, at the most,
but I thought she was the grand-daughter so

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.490
he pinched Me and told Me that "Don't."

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:09.870
This is it, you see.

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:15.610
It's such a paradoxical world that if you
come from Sahaj to this, you see "What's going

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:16.610
on?

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:17.610
What are they doing?

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:19.500
What's the matter with them?"

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:24.990
Now, taking out clothes, is it something great
to take out clothes, you see?

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:31.900
In Switzerland, which is such a cold country,
I was wearing My sweater, My coat, covering

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:38.430
My head, wearing warm socks, everything because
they said, "Let's go out for, just for a drive."

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:41.410
So, we got down.

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:45.140
There's one lake called Lausanne.

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:46.540
Lausanne, there's a very big lake.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.350
So, as usual, Gregoire ran up to see how is
the situation there.

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:50.800
He came back with a double speed.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.900
He said, "No, no, Mother, You can't go there."

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:53.900
I said, "Why?"

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:54.900
"No.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:55.900
You can't.

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:56.900
I am sorry.

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:57.900
You can't.

00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:58.900
Let's go."

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.230
They were all topless women sitting there.

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:06.910
You know, this - in Australia they had, and
even New Zealand, they had cricket match.

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:11.070
They're supposed to be very good cricketers.

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:13.940
And when we opened the TV, the women were
sitting topless.

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.360
We closed it.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.890
We couldn't see that, but I was told now they're
losing in cricket.

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:26.730
They will, definitely, compared to Indian
spinners, who are young innocent boys, you

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:28.790
see - very young, twenty, twenty-one.

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:33.550
They have to be because there's no innocence,
there's no chastity, there's no respect.

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:35.410
The women are sitting topless.

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:36.640
How can they win?

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:39.040
They're insulting the Goddess there only.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.140
How can they win?

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:45.300
They cannot win, and a game like cricket is
something sensible.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:51.830
Even, I don't know, in any game if they can
win, because if this - distract the attention

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:52.830
completely.

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:55.410
But why do they go like that?

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:59.000
Are all women trying to become prostitutes?

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.860
What is the sense in it?

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.280
I can't understand.

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.380
And this is something they don't understand.

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:11.030
If you tell them that, "You see, I was told
that Mrs. Thatcher openly said that in this

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:15.420
culture women must expose their body."

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:17.500
There's such a paradox.

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:18.870
Can't understand.

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:25.140
They show here Mother Mary as the sublime
personality, and they show here women as the

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:28.120
- women who are nude.

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:33.100
They want to become Mother Mary or what do
they want to become?

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:38.380
And people like this, horrible people like
this Michael Jackson - he is that - are so

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:40.210
prominent making money.

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:41.940
I mean, just see the paradox.

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:52.640
Can you say that this is an advanced country
when the ideas are so, so low?

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.620
How can it be?

00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:04.320
After coming to Sahaja Yoga, you can see for
yourself, but it makes your, these protective

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.840
genes established in you.

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.570
This is the thing in Sahaj Yoga.

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:11.000
And suddenly, you people have given up all
that nonsense.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.250
You don't want all that now.

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:20.900
Actually, if you see it properly from any
logical point of view, you see, without the

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:26.393
Maya of this nonsense - if you see it, you
can logically understand that it is wrong.

00:30:26.393 --> 00:30:32.460
You see, why do you feel jealous of another
man or woman?

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:33.799
You feel jealous.

00:30:33.799 --> 00:30:37.370
That means you want just life, isn't it?

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:43.670
People have murdered, women have murdered
men or women because they were jealous.

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:51.830
If it was natural and normal and joy giving,
you should not have felt bad about it.

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:56.910
All these things should logically be understood
that, why we don't like this happening.

00:30:56.910 --> 00:30:59.780
Or this happens to your own daughter, you
may not like.

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:04.400
Nowadays there are people who like it, also,
to the daughters.

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:10.500
But - now going to that limit of things, like
there's one person, say, he has something

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:15.250
to do with the daughter and the whole society's
against it, today.

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:23.070
But maybe tomorrow, with this Maya, this horrible
devil-maya, which is anti-maya, will work

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:27.020
out and maybe that nobody will mind it.

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:28.640
It may be.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:37.140
If you people do not hold it right into your
hands, the culture side of Sahaj, I don't

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:38.390
know what's going to happen.

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:42.870
If you read newspaper every day, you feel
really dizzy, you don't understand in what

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:44.919
Maya these people are lost.

00:31:44.919 --> 00:31:47.080
So it's an anti-maya.

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:50.820
Because Mahamaya has come, so anti-maya has
come.

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:56.020
Fifty years back or sixty years back, it was
not that bad, I can tell you.

00:31:56.020 --> 00:32:01.500
Once in a while people used to do something
nonsensical, but now it is rampant.

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:04.060
But it now has become a fashion.

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:10.040
It's worse than that, is that accepted as
a fashion, and if you're not in it, you're

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:11.040
out.

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:15.170
You have to be in the madhouse.

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:20.460
You should see this clearly because now you
have come into the Maya of God.

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:27.810
"Maya" also means love, the God's love, and,
in that, your eyes should open out and see:

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:30.480
what horrible things this they are doing?

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:31.480
What is this disco?

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:37.270
You know, in India they brought the disco
and, of course, some boys who were Muslims

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:45.070
actually were rich and they carried young
girls, because in disco the law was that you

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:51.350
must bring your partner - young girls who
were adults, maybe not be adults also, and

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:57.230
started giving them alcohol, drinking and
they got lost.

00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:58.590
The parents wouldn't accept them.

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:04.280
They had to go to brothels or they were sold
out or I don't know what happened to them.

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.560
But that is the reaction in that country.

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.870
It may be one day they'll be accepted.

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:14.820
One day we'll have the same thing because
it has such a overpowering effect, and that's

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:17.590
why the Maya of God is such.

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:24.910
This, all these beautiful things are there
so you can get lost with it, you can see it,

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:27.400
you can picture it, you can paint it.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.740
But no, they are not - they're not interested.

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:31.460
They'll make this also ugly.

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:33.060
They'll make every picture ugly.

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:35.520
They'll make every face ugly.

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:41.730
So this is the anti-maya that is there and,
for that, you need a Mahamaya to correct it

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:44.650
and to solve the problem.

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:50.270
The complete working of the Divine depends
on you people, wherever you are.

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:59.250
How many you are is not the point - wherever
you are, how intense you are, how you want

00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:06.370
to work it out, how you want to put your attention
to.

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:13.909
It's very important how you are going to do,
it because you people should understand the

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:14.909
responsibility.

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:21.849
This world is getting drowned, and I feel
that at least eighty percent people will be

00:34:21.849 --> 00:34:23.329
finished.

00:34:23.329 --> 00:34:29.940
Ten would be hanging in between in limbo I
think, really, and ten percent will be Sahaja

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:32.259
Yogis, the way it is moving in the West.

00:34:32.259 --> 00:34:34.179
Maybe in India may not be.

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:35.179
I can't say.

00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:37.540
India is very fast-moving Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:42.649
Also Russia and all these Eastern Bloc people
are just jumping into it.

00:34:42.649 --> 00:34:45.769
I don't know how they have discovered Me so
easily.

00:34:45.769 --> 00:34:46.990
They say My Face is evident.

00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:54.879
I don't know what makes them think.

00:34:54.879 --> 00:34:58.150
The another Maya is of power.

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:05.140
And the power of money if they can avoid,
then they try to have power over territory,

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:07.900
of the land, this, that.

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:13.220
That also made them mad quite a lot in the
past, but now they're all fighting for some

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:16.250
nonsensical land, which will never belong
to them.

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:20.730
It stays here permanently, eternally, but
the fights are going on.

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:26.789
Then, in the name of religion, they're fighting
for this area, that area or they're fighting

00:35:26.789 --> 00:35:34.789
for, say, just for changing their religion
or getting more people in that religion.

00:35:34.789 --> 00:35:38.500
I don't know what is their idea of religion
is.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.410
Is religion meant for that?

00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:41.820
Just think of it.

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.400
Nobody thinks like that.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.920
What is it meant for?

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:52.040
So here, again, the Mahamaya has to work and
the Mahamaya works this way, that She integrates

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.569
all the religions.

00:35:53.569 --> 00:35:59.119
She shows that all religions are the same,
have the same spirituality.

00:35:59.119 --> 00:36:04.299
It's on the same tree of spirituality, they
have grown.

00:36:04.299 --> 00:36:08.470
Instead of making people spiritual, they have
made them money-oriented or they have made

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:11.490
them power-oriented.

00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:13.470
I mean it's the other way round.

00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:21.609
It's like the tree growing underneath or something,
something absurd that you cannot explain and

00:36:21.609 --> 00:36:24.500
that is the thing is that illusive.

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.180
That illusiveness is called Maya.

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:32.640
And this illusiveness appeals to many people.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.359
Appeals - that's the point I'm worried about.

00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:42.509
Something is illusive, then they go on running
after that like a mirage and ultimately they

00:36:42.509 --> 00:36:43.509
are destroyed.

00:36:43.509 --> 00:36:51.160
So what you see, a picture just now, is that
at least so many - ten percent people - will

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.230
be saved, at the most.

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:59.299
But this is a very sad affair because it has
taken so much effort to make human beings,

00:36:59.299 --> 00:37:05.019
to make them all right, to make them sensible
and now what you find is that they are going

00:37:05.019 --> 00:37:06.259
to be all finished.

00:37:06.259 --> 00:37:12.480
It's too much to bear, too much to believe
in, but it is going to happen, if you people

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:15.410
do not take it up seriously and work it out.

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:21.210
For you, also, there should not be any illusions
because many of you are more busy with other

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:22.210
things.

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:25.059
To you other things are more important than
Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:25.059 --> 00:37:28.490
But whatever you are doing, you can bring
in Sahaja Yoga into that.

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:31.230
Into anything you can bring in Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:36.900
I said in politics, in agriculture, in social
life, in your jobs, everywhere you can bring

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:37.900
Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:45.779
By your own behavior, by your own intelligence,
you can bring in Sahaja Yoga into every field,

00:37:45.779 --> 00:37:49.059
which you have to think about, "Where can
we take Sahaj Yoga?

00:37:49.059 --> 00:37:50.410
Where can we work it out?"

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:59.400
And this is what is to get into the Maya of
God, that you get rid of all the illusions

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:04.770
which are false, which do not allow you to
see the right thing, and then seriously to

00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:08.080
get into the productive side of Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:14.470
Can you imagine how productive is Sahaja Yoga,
how the miracles work out, how there is this

00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:19.290
Divine Power is anxious to help, despite all
this Mahamaya and all that.

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:26.700
I'll give you the example of My grandson now
because this time we had a big Maya on him.

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:31.040
He was - I told him that, "You should not
go to Cambridge, you know."

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:35.210
I said, "They don't give admissions normally
and, moreover, it's more sort of theoretical

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:37.500
things, not actually good for you.

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:40.390
You'll be bored stupid there, so don't go."

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:41.760
He wouldn't listen to Me.

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:46.150
Then he agreed, "All right, if I get admission
in these, these big universities in America

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:47.150
I'll go."

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:48.250
But he didn't try.

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:49.250
Nothing of the kind.

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:55.230
Last minute we sent him a application and
he sent that application.

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:56.430
Last minute.

00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:58.790
They said, "You cannot come.

00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:59.790
This is that.

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:06.000
You have to prepare for this exam, SAT exam,
that exam", and then he got a fright.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.000
You see, which he learnt.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.279
"My God, I thought so easy to go to America.

00:39:09.279 --> 00:39:10.930
It is not."

00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:13.420
Even if you certify money it is not easy.

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:18.630
Then he started thinking that "What was I
thinking about Cambridge, Cambridge so much?

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:22.180
This is the same, equally the same difficult
thing.

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:28.660
" Until then he wanted to go for SAT, there
to sit for an exam, but actually the appearing

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:33.980
of the examination was only after six days
and I thought, "How can he go?

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:36.210
Six days he cannot prepare even."

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:38.430
So they said, "You cannot come for SAT here."

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:40.319
Now he was settled down in India.

00:39:40.319 --> 00:39:41.760
He didn't know what to do.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:45.960
Still he was saying, "I'll try for this Cambridge
again and this."

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.650
I said, "Now, forget it."

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:49.880
He wouldn't listen to Me.

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.359
Then he was very disappointed.

00:39:51.359 --> 00:39:57.840
He telephoned to Me to say that "I think that
if I have to go to America, I'll go in a good

00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:58.840
university.

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:04.019
Otherwise, no use going to a cheap university;
I can get better education in India."

00:40:04.019 --> 00:40:05.019
So I said, "All right."

00:40:05.019 --> 00:40:08.960
Then I gave a bandhan because he wanted to
go abroad and learn something.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:09.960
It's all right.

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:13.980
Can you imagine, it has worked like a real
miracle.

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:19.170
The university wrote to him that he is admitted
unconditionally.

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:20.210
Nobody did anything.

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:22.740
Nobody wrote anything.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:24.010
Nothing.

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:25.010
They have said it.

00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:30.119
None of them can understand what has happened,
how did they get unconditional admission?

00:40:30.119 --> 00:40:35.940
So, you see, it's a miracle, but before that
this Maya was to be played, otherwise he would

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:39.069
never have seen the importance of it.

00:40:39.069 --> 00:40:41.549
So, in your lives also, such a Maya plays.

00:40:41.549 --> 00:40:43.730
When you do not want to do the right thing.

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:45.269
All right, do it.

00:40:45.269 --> 00:40:46.430
You do this.

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:47.970
All right, do that.

00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:48.970
Do that.

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:50.680
Ultimately, you learn a lesson.

00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:53.009
I don't say no, if you say, "Mother, I want
to do it."

00:40:53.009 --> 00:40:54.009
"All right, go ahead."

00:40:54.009 --> 00:40:55.009
"I want to do that."

00:40:55.009 --> 00:40:57.510
"Oh, go ahead, whatever you want to do."

00:40:57.510 --> 00:41:02.420
If I find you congenial, I may tell you that
"Better not do, it's not going to help you."

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:10.200
But then they,when they get a complete disillusionment,
then they take to the right decision, come

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:16.470
to the right thing because, see, let them
try with their own freedom, but then they

00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:18.259
realize that, "What Mother said was right.

00:41:18.259 --> 00:41:19.849
I should have done that.

00:41:19.849 --> 00:41:20.950
All right."

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:22.170
So this is it.

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:27.191
The Maya is like this, that it allows you
to do what you like.

00:41:27.191 --> 00:41:28.740
You use your freedom.

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:29.980
You go places to places.

00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:32.210
Do what you want to do.

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:33.910
Whatever you think it proper, you do it.

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:40.670
All right, this is a part of the Maya, but
Mahamaya is that which brings you back, brings

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:47.720
you back to normal, brings you back to reality,
to understand.

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:51.400
It is at that point when you understand Mahamaya.

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:54.049
Like I would say Russians did.

00:41:54.049 --> 00:41:59.490
How they understood that I'm doing greater
work than Einstein?

00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:02.329
"See, what is Einstein?

00:42:02.329 --> 00:42:04.990
He is just working with the matter.

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:08.349
You are working with human beings, do You
realize, Mother."

00:42:08.349 --> 00:42:13.780
To them I am higher than all of them, greater
than all of them, which is a fact also, I

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:14.780
must say.

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:21.590
It's fact in a way that the way work is done,
but doesn't mean that it's something to be

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:25.029
ego about it, because if I am made like that,
I am doing it.

00:42:25.029 --> 00:42:26.029
What is so special?

00:42:26.029 --> 00:42:29.630
I've been like this, so I'm like that.

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:31.210
What is so special?

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:35.690
One gets the pride and the ego only when you
think you are doing something more beyond

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:36.690
you.

00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:37.690
You see, it's all there.

00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:38.690
I've already got it.

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:40.839
Now, see this tent is meant to give shade.

00:42:40.839 --> 00:42:46.299
Now if it is giving shade, should it have
ego?

00:42:46.299 --> 00:42:48.109
Sun is meant to give you light.

00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:53.339
If it is giving light, it's giving light because
God has given him the light to be given, so

00:42:53.339 --> 00:42:54.759
he's giving light to you.

00:42:54.759 --> 00:42:56.249
Should he have ego?

00:42:56.249 --> 00:43:03.990
But you'll be, you see, assume that you have
got something special about you, then you

00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:05.869
have to do that, whatever special you have.

00:43:05.869 --> 00:43:09.690
Now, the flowers are so beautiful, they're
so special, so charming.

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:13.040
I mean, I couldn't take out My attention from
them, they're so beautiful.

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:16.150
All right, but if they are so, they are so.

00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:17.260
What is there?

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:22.490
They're not going to have ego about it, that
"We are so good, we are so beautiful."

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:25.710
No, none of that.

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:33.049
So this ego comes when there is again the
Mahamaya part of it, that you are in the Maya

00:43:33.049 --> 00:43:36.789
of your own understanding.

00:43:36.789 --> 00:43:39.279
Now you're Sahaja Yogis.

00:43:39.279 --> 00:43:40.410
You should be very proud.

00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:43.900
You should be, I don't know.

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:50.460
Look at these horrible people who are not
at all connected with God.

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:51.660
They have nothing to do.

00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:57.779
Yesterday that lady, she gives Me a lecture
that "Why don't you praise the Lord?," you

00:43:57.779 --> 00:43:58.779
see.

00:43:58.779 --> 00:44:00.480
She's giving Me a lecture.

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:07.880
So it is just a sort of a assumption that
"I am something great" that makes you ego,

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:12.460
but that is also a Maya, because you have
to learn.

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:20.880
Ultimately, your ego breaks and you understand
that "Oh, a Humpty-Dumpty it was."

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:24.440
Once you discover that, "I don't want to have
an ego any more."

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:28.200
I mean there are some Sahaja Yogis who refuse
to do any work of Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.200
I said, "Why?"

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:33.820
"Mother, we are too intelligent and our intelligence
cheats us and we'll develop ego."

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:36.450
I said, "Now this is an escape.

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:42.890
It won't, Sahaja Yoga can never give you ego,
but will give you joy.

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:44.890
If it is giving you ego, it's not Sahaj.

00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:47.119
It should just give you joy.

00:44:47.119 --> 00:44:52.869
Giving somebody to Realization or somebody
you're curing, somebody being kind, anything,

00:44:52.869 --> 00:44:55.089
it just gives you satisfaction and you enjoy.

00:44:55.089 --> 00:44:56.089
It's a fact.

00:44:56.089 --> 00:45:01.010
I mean, you have come all the way here, you
are playing such good music, all this.

00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:04.150
Now you learnt Indian style, I don't know
how.

00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:06.160
Anybody should be very full of ego.

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.910
But no, in the Maya of your Mother, you just
enjoy.

00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:12.430
Maya should give you enjoyment.

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:18.940
That's the best thing that this Maya can give,
and you can enjoy it so much.

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:32.279
I think it is a very beautiful atmosphere
created by this Mahamaya.

00:45:32.279 --> 00:45:36.829
So you can enjoy each other, you can enjoy
My company, you can enjoy nature.

00:45:36.829 --> 00:45:44.039
Such a rapport, such a beautiful understanding
between everything else is there.

00:45:44.039 --> 00:45:49.770
Nobody is bothered as to who is higher, who
is lower, what is the position; how much money

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:52.510
he has got or what he has got.

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:54.180
Nothing, just you're all enjoying.

00:45:54.180 --> 00:46:00.380
If somebody has a talent, he enjoys because
he has a talent and the others also enjoy

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:02.410
because he has talent.

00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:04.940
No jealousies, no rivalries, nothing.

00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:06.200
Somebody sings better, all right.

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:09.349
They'll tell Me, "Mother, You know, he sings
very well."

00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:19.109
There's one fellow in Paris and he is, I think
he's a black, from the black side, because

00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:23.660
he has very curly hair, a very nice boy.

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:26.990
So, suddenly, somebody came from Italy.

00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:29.029
"Mother, do You know he dances very well?"

00:46:29.029 --> 00:46:30.029
"How do you know?"

00:46:30.029 --> 00:46:31.029
"I've seen him dancing."

00:46:31.029 --> 00:46:33.329
"So when did you see me dancing?" he asked.

00:46:33.329 --> 00:46:36.060
"You know, you came to that program.

00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:37.060
I saw that."

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:38.230
In a group he saw him.

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:40.769
He just got hold of him, "You'd better dance
before Mother."

00:46:40.769 --> 00:46:45.030
It was so much, you see, so joy-giving, this
kind of thing.

00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:52.749
He saw him in some sort of a program where
they were at least two thousand people dancing.

00:46:52.749 --> 00:46:54.680
He picked him out.

00:46:54.680 --> 00:47:01.089
Now, he's from Paris, and he's from Italy,
and how his eyes picked him up and he brought

00:47:01.089 --> 00:47:02.089
him.

00:47:02.089 --> 00:47:03.089
"Mother.

00:47:03.089 --> 00:47:04.089
You'd better dance before Mother, must!

00:47:04.089 --> 00:47:05.230
You are very good."

00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:06.390
And he was.

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:09.390
But you see I might have missed it or whatever
it is.

00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:11.999
And even if I'd seen it I may not have asked
him.

00:47:11.999 --> 00:47:16.559
But this fellow went down there, and he's
got hold of him and he out put him here.

00:47:16.559 --> 00:47:19.920
I mean, these things are so joy-giving, you
see.

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:27.480
It is otherwise, in the normal course, what
one would do, come before Me and start dancing,

00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:31.200
whether know or not and try to show off.

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.200
Normally.

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:37.890
But the one who knows never brought like that,
"Now, come along" and in such an impersonal

00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:40.670
way he saw him and brought him.

00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:47.799
It makes no difference whether they're from
Russia, or from America, or from India.

00:47:47.799 --> 00:47:52.109
So all these differences which are skin deep
are finished.

00:47:52.109 --> 00:47:57.799
And I find everybody appreciates everybody's
talent, everybody, how he speaks and suddenly,

00:47:57.799 --> 00:48:00.569
you'll find someone say, "Oh, he's such a
gem."

00:48:00.569 --> 00:48:02.130
"When did you meet him?"

00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:03.920
"No, I've heard about him."

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:12.390
You see, all this appreciation and all this
beautiful feeling for others, you see, is

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:13.690
only possible through Sahaj.

00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:16.109
No jealousies, no rivalries, nothing.

00:48:16.109 --> 00:48:21.820
These come because of an ignorance, which
creates the Maya about yourself, also: "I

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:22.820
am this.

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:24.329
I am that."

00:48:24.329 --> 00:48:27.700
And then the "I" comes down like that.

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:31.970
So all conditionings also can create a Maya.

00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:36.099
Many conditionings are there that "I am from
such a family.

00:48:36.099 --> 00:48:37.800
I am from such a thing."

00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:39.630
That all has to be stopped.

00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:45.940
So today's special day is this of New Year's
where they said, "Now, today's the most auspicious

00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:51.999
day to start something new," and this Mahamaya's
dissolving has to be started.

00:48:51.999 --> 00:48:54.069
Gradually, you should try to understand.

00:48:54.069 --> 00:48:57.769
Many people ask Me, "Mother, how did You do
it?"

00:48:57.769 --> 00:48:58.769
Forget it.

00:48:58.769 --> 00:48:59.769
It's Mahamaya.

00:48:59.769 --> 00:49:00.769
Forget it.

00:49:00.769 --> 00:49:02.109
How did I do it?

00:49:02.109 --> 00:49:04.029
Just forget it.

00:49:04.029 --> 00:49:05.569
That part you need not go into.

00:49:05.569 --> 00:49:06.680
Just enjoy.

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:11.119
Just enjoy that you are in that Maya and you
are enjoying it.

00:49:11.119 --> 00:49:14.940
It's the best way to enjoy this Mahamaya.

00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:18.190
And today, for the first time, we have this
Puja of Mahamaya.

00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:24.250
Because of Gudipadwa, I thought something
unique must be done which encompasses everything

00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:27.319
of Sahaja Yoga, everything of Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:27.319 --> 00:49:34.670
It's not one incarnation, it's not one nadi,
it's not one Goddess, but all of it is there.

00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:44.619
It's sometimes I say like a film is audio,
visual, everything is there - drama, music,

00:49:44.619 --> 00:49:46.519
also acting.

00:49:46.519 --> 00:49:48.200
Everything is there in a film now.

00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:51.670
I mean that far, everything integrated.

00:49:51.670 --> 00:50:01.440
In the same way, I think Mahamaya has everything
in it: every part that you tell Me, everything

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:04.940
that you enjoy, everything that you discover.

00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:10.019
Everything is in that vision of Mahamaya,
which has been created for you.

00:50:10.019 --> 00:50:12.522
May God bless you.
