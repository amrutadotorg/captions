00:00:07.814 --> 00:00:10.153
As you know very well

00:00:10.331 --> 00:00:16.976
that all the satanic forces which one had to face one at the time

00:00:17.057 --> 00:00:24.314
are all back on the stage and they are to be defeated.

00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:29.040
The greatest problem of modern times is

00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:35.167
that these satanic forces have taken a very subtle form

00:00:35.488 --> 00:00:39.813
and they enter into your psyches and into your egos.

00:00:40.908 --> 00:00:46.471
And you are the saints, you are the bhaktas, you are the devotees of the Goddess.

00:00:46.774 --> 00:00:53.006
It’s a very delicate situation when the confusion is there.

00:00:53.183 --> 00:01:02.934
When the saints are attacked, the aggressor can be removed,

00:01:03.076 --> 00:01:11.922
but the saint becomes mixed up or confused with negative forces,

00:01:12.637 --> 00:01:17.297
which is very difficult to make him see the light.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.787
And you have seen this situation very well.

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:25.884
And the subtler you grow, the subtler they became.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.683
And they start giving you ideas which are so negative,

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:37.220
but you cannot see them.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.801
So the problem today is very delicate.

00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:53.328
There are no absolute saints and there are no absolute bad people.

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.289
Such a mixture, a confusion,

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.400
that is what is Kali Yuga is, these modern times are.

00:02:02.576 --> 00:02:08.046
The only way to get rid of them is to surrender.

00:02:09.445 --> 00:02:14.243
That is the only way, there is no other way out.

00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:17.201
Because when you surrender,

00:02:17.282 --> 00:02:24.569
the spirits, the negativities, the satanic forces just disappear

00:02:24.765 --> 00:02:28.228
because they are not effective.

00:02:29.563 --> 00:02:31.553
They have no business to be there.

00:02:31.634 --> 00:02:38.112
They have no interest in a person who is surrendered to God.

00:02:38.437 --> 00:02:41.437
They cannot surrender.

00:02:42.227 --> 00:02:47.223
If they surrender, they’ll also become saints.

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:56.837
All the time to think: “What are my catches? 
What are my negativities?” Is not going to help you.

00:02:56.918 --> 00:03:00.353
Just surrender all these ideas that are coming to you

00:03:00.455 --> 00:03:06.006
and you’ll find that all absurd ideas will run away.

00:03:06.282 --> 00:03:13.395
This is the easiest way to get rid of your problems, is just to surrender.

00:03:13.583 --> 00:03:28.305
After all, all these horrible people, all the horrible deities, enemies,

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:41.891
who came forward to fight the Goddess, are there as long as you nurture them.

00:03:43.373 --> 00:03:47.978
As soon as you surrender yourself,

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:51.773
they find you of no use for themselves

00:03:51.921 --> 00:03:56.582
and they go to other half-baked people.

00:03:59.213 --> 00:04:04.748
The growth will only come, when the surrender is complete.

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:13.123
One has to know that the powers are tremendous.

00:04:13.593 --> 00:04:16.806
You cannot conceive it as it is said by Markandeya.

00:04:16.886 --> 00:04:21.343
You cannot conceive it; it is beyond your conception.

00:04:21.534 --> 00:04:28.048
Outwardly you cannot understand, you just cannot understand.

00:04:29.952 --> 00:04:34.773
Under such circumstances, the best thing is to surrender yourself.

00:04:34.854 --> 00:04:40.138
Now with surrendering, what do you
surrender? What do you surrender?

00:04:40.218 --> 00:04:44.054
It’s your ego and your super-ego

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:50.818
and it is completely cleansed and drenched in the blessing.

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:53.521
Because you cannot give anything,

00:04:53.602 --> 00:04:56.151
you have to receive the blessings

00:04:56.237 --> 00:05:00.372
and to receive the blessings you have to just surrender.

00:05:00.453 --> 00:05:02.528
It is so simple.

00:05:02.609 --> 00:05:09.150
The easiest way to solve all your problems is to surrender.

00:05:12.106 --> 00:05:18.081
Just say: “I surrender”. For Realized souls this should be their mantra.

00:05:18.162 --> 00:05:23.648
And you will be amazed how all your problems will vanish.

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:30.091
Because not only that the powers are tremendous,

00:05:30.962 --> 00:05:34.301
but as you are Realized souls

00:05:34.386 --> 00:05:40.552
all the divine Forces, all the divine Deities,

00:05:40.815 --> 00:05:43.668
all the Eternal Beings, Chiranjivas,

00:05:43.786 --> 00:05:47.363
all the angels and the ganas,

00:05:47.484 --> 00:05:50.282
all of them are looking after you.

00:05:50.363 --> 00:05:56.650
But they know one thing, those who are surrendered and those who are not surrendered.

00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:59.521
You just surrender the problem,

00:05:59.602 --> 00:06:03.702
and you will be surprised that the answer will come in such a miraculous way.

00:06:03.783 --> 00:06:10.463
Just surrender. Do not take any responsibility upon yourself. Just surrender.

00:06:11.043 --> 00:06:16.974
Because how far you can go into the solution? Up to your rationality.

00:06:17.055 --> 00:06:23.353
Beyond that you are your Spirit, and the Spirit is connected to the Divine.

00:06:23.434 --> 00:06:26.053
So best is to surrender

00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:33.245
and the whole thing will show such light and such beauty.

00:06:35.543 --> 00:06:37.738
Surrender also, what do you surrender to me?

00:06:37.884 --> 00:06:39.717
What do I want out of you?
Nothing!

00:06:39.833 --> 00:06:43.499
What do you have to surrender to me?
I just don’t understand.

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.247
Surrender you own ego, your own barriers.

00:06:47.328 --> 00:06:51.844
What you surrender is your own barrier,

00:06:53.021 --> 00:06:55.260
so what is there to surrender?

00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:59.519
If you have your ego intact, you won’t work out Sahaja Yoga,

00:06:59.701 --> 00:07:01.783
you will be insensitive.

00:07:01.864 --> 00:07:07.765
Supposing this thing is covered with some sort of cloth
and you cannot see,

00:07:07.924 --> 00:07:12.863
then you remove the cloth from it,
will you say it has been surrendered?

00:07:12.944 --> 00:07:15.252
This ‘surrender’ word itself is very treacherous

00:07:15.308 --> 00:07:17.526
because that immediately acts on your ego.

00:07:17.607 --> 00:07:20.006
Actually, surrender means surrender your ego.

00:07:20.087 --> 00:07:22.256
But when somebody says,
“You must surrender to Mataji!”

00:07:22.294 --> 00:07:25.831
that means you think that
you have to surrender your money!

00:07:25.912 --> 00:07:29.289
What is there in money?
I don’t want your money.

00:07:30.674 --> 00:07:33.699
What is there to surrender to me?

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.325
I mean just imagine!
What are you going to give to me?

00:07:36.406 --> 00:07:38.844
I have nothing to get from you!

00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:42.819
Is that there anything that I
can get from you? Nothing!

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:48.598
Luckily this time, even in this lifetime,

00:07:49.106 --> 00:07:54.763
I’m born in such way, in such family,
that I don’t need anything.

00:07:54.844 --> 00:08:00.686
I have even got paid and a position in that,
so even that I don’t need!

00:08:00.767 --> 00:08:04.752
What is there to surrender to me?

00:08:05.757 --> 00:08:10.623
You have to surrender your own ego, that’s all,

00:08:10.774 --> 00:08:14.946
and you will feel free with that,
because you are bound by your own ego.

00:08:15.027 --> 00:08:22.533
Supposing you are in the shackles of chains,
you are chained:

00:08:23.404 --> 00:08:28.460
now if you want to remove the chains,
are you surrendering those chains?

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:38.714
What you are surrendering is your own inhibitions, 
your own problems, your own shackles,

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:43.560
which do not give you freedom;

00:08:45.146 --> 00:08:51.402
your chains, your conditionings, your diseases, your troubles —

00:08:51.483 --> 00:08:54.572
that’s what you have surrendered.

00:08:55.562 --> 00:08:59.057
What is there to surrender?
I just don’t understand.

00:08:59.138 --> 00:09:05.037
Just to remove the clouds
which are over your Spirit,

00:09:06.478 --> 00:09:11.542
you have to make Kundalini
rise with a great force

00:09:11.623 --> 00:09:13.684
so that they are all thrown away.

00:09:22.361 --> 00:09:32.755
To keep Sahasrara open should be very easy

00:09:32.956 --> 00:09:39.840
if the Western brains could understand

00:09:43.105 --> 00:09:46.380
and be aware

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.763
about your Mother.

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:10.340
When your Mother is the Deity of Sahasrara,

00:10:14.442 --> 00:10:23.860
the only way to be able to keep the Sahasrara open

00:10:24.061 --> 00:10:28.705
has to be complete surrendering.

00:10:35.782 --> 00:10:42.592
For that many ask Me, "How do we do?"

00:10:44.114 --> 00:10:48.093
It's a very funny question.

00:10:48.294 --> 00:10:52.274
It is irrelevant.

00:11:01.495 --> 00:11:07.173
If your Sahasrara has been opened out by someone,

00:11:07.374 --> 00:11:13.317
and luckily that is the Deity before you,

00:11:13.518 --> 00:11:20.437
it should be the easiest thing to surrender,

00:11:26.753 --> 00:11:30.206
but it is not.

00:11:31.166 --> 00:11:36.459
It is difficult

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:44.550
because the attention that has come up,

00:11:45.993 --> 00:11:49.977
through the cells of the brain,

00:11:50.178 --> 00:11:58.032
expressing itself through the cells of the brain,

00:11:58.233 --> 00:12:01.485
is polluted,

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:08.643
it is impure, it is destructive.

00:12:12.404 --> 00:12:17.584
It spoils the nerves

00:12:19.517 --> 00:12:27.397
and when the nerves are spoilt, the light of the Spirit

00:12:27.598 --> 00:12:32.859
does not shine on the nerves.

00:12:38.173 --> 00:12:50.839
And you feel the inability to surrender.

00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:57.754
Normally it should be the easiest thing to do.

00:13:06.162 --> 00:13:11.212
So we have to mentally approach ourselves.

00:13:13.931 --> 00:13:18.394
We have to talk to ourselves

00:13:18.595 --> 00:13:21.874
and say to ourselves

00:13:22.075 --> 00:13:26.045
“What are you doing?”

00:13:29.424 --> 00:13:33.414
What is surrendering?

00:13:34.045 --> 00:13:38.289
It is enjoyment.

00:13:42.537 --> 00:13:46.370
It is just enjoyment.

00:13:47.148 --> 00:13:51.636
“Then why I cannot surrender?

00:13:52.045 --> 00:13:56.728
What is lacking in me?

00:13:57.307 --> 00:14:01.775
Am I a very low level person?

00:14:03.046 --> 00:14:09.842
Am I the one who was just saying I'm a seeker

00:14:10.043 --> 00:14:12.394
but I'm not?

00:14:12.995 --> 00:14:19.658
Am I a dishonest person that I cannot surrender?

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:25.329
If so, what am I proud of myself?

00:14:27.468 --> 00:14:36.666
If that is the situation, then why am I

00:14:36.867 --> 00:14:45.190
so much enamoured by my ego?”

00:14:56.785 --> 00:15:00.511
What do you have to surrender?

00:15:06.038 --> 00:15:14.020
A drop has to dissolve into the ocean to become the ocean.

00:15:17.394 --> 00:15:24.228
And a drop cannot be greater than the ocean - can it be?

00:15:24.882 --> 00:15:28.058
So what is the surrendering?

00:15:28.259 --> 00:15:33.145
Surrendering of our conditionings, of our ego

00:15:33.346 --> 00:15:39.787
and the artificial barriers we have built around us.

00:15:39.988 --> 00:15:49.056
One can approach mentally. One can approach emotionally

00:15:49.257 --> 00:15:55.063
and also physically we can approach ourselves.

00:15:55.616 --> 00:16:03.133
We can approach ourselves through mantras,

00:16:03.334 --> 00:16:07.176
through seeing ourselves,

00:16:07.377 --> 00:16:11.816
through knowing ourselves.

00:16:14.747 --> 00:16:21.159
But one should know this is

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:28.267
the greatest of greatest opportunity - for you -

00:16:28.468 --> 00:16:32.135
not for the Divine.

00:16:33.546 --> 00:16:37.682
If you are not available
Divine can find Its own ways

00:16:37.763 --> 00:16:44.542
of fulfilling Its last culmination of expression.

00:16:50.794 --> 00:17:00.493
Even to understand how immense the task is

00:17:00.694 --> 00:17:05.875
you need a surrendering heart.

00:17:07.177 --> 00:17:13.796
So you have to, tomorrow, take a vow

00:17:13.877 --> 00:17:18.782
within your heart.
It's not the words that are important.

00:17:18.863 --> 00:17:26.389
It has to be living action of your being, that should prove,

00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:31.488
that should convince you that we are fully surrendered.

00:17:31.767 --> 00:17:35.451
And the effects of that you'll feel in your own personality,

00:17:35.652 --> 00:17:39.588
in your own being, in your own manifestation.

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:45.103
I'm working twenty-four hours.

00:17:45.837 --> 00:17:50.274
Not a single minute I waste.

00:17:50.993 --> 00:17:59.307
And in the same way I hope you will dedicate your twenty-four hours

00:17:59.508 --> 00:18:07.611
for your emancipation and the emancipation of the whole Universe.

00:18:08.898 --> 00:18:11.642
May God bless you all.
