1
00:04:28,048 --> 00:04:37,123
Today we are celebrating the opening 
of the Sahasrara on this day.

2
00:04:38,076 --> 00:04:45,071
I must say it was a great happening 
that took place

3
00:04:45,272 --> 00:04:48,796
for all the humanity.

4
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:55,312
It was such an achievement which I never 
realized before,

5
00:04:55,512 --> 00:05:00,599
now I can see, that without Self 
Realization

6
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,020
it would have been impossible to talk 
to people.

7
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:14,078
When this happened

8
00:05:17,906 --> 00:05:23,582
I thought that, how will I talk to people 
about it,

9
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:29,235
because no one would understand Me,

10
00:05:29,436 --> 00:05:36,953
and it would be a big mistake on My part,

11
00:05:37,153 --> 00:05:42,772
to say something about Sahasrara.

12
00:05:44,562 --> 00:05:54,611
Because even about Sahasrara, nowhere 
in the scriptures somethings was described.

13
00:05:54,812 --> 00:06:03,202
It was absolutely an ambiguous description, 
I would say, where people could not

14
00:06:03,403 --> 00:06:09,463
have even thought that there is a realm 
beyond Sahasrara.

15
00:06:10,836 --> 00:06:19,622
And one has to enter into that realm where 
is the reality.

16
00:06:22,524 --> 00:06:31,933
That time, what I saw around Me, I felt is 
all darkness,

17
00:06:32,777 --> 00:06:36,948
and unless and until there are many lights,

18
00:06:37,149 --> 00:06:44,025
people will never realize that how 
important it is to have lights.

19
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:49,630
It is a human error, also, all the time,

20
00:06:49,883 --> 00:06:57,077
that if somebody achieves something, 
then they put that person onto a shelf.

21
00:06:57,277 --> 00:07:02,409
For example, Christ - all right, He was 
Christ - we are not Christ.

22
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,097
Mohammed Sahib, He was Mohammed Sahib - 
we are not Mohammed Sahib.

23
00:07:06,298 --> 00:07:11,909
Rama was Rama, Krishna was Krishna. We are 
not that.

24
00:07:12,798 --> 00:07:17,757
How can you expect human beings to behave 
like Them?

25
00:07:17,957 --> 00:07:24,268
So, absolutely they are separated, 
the divine personalities -

26
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:28,756
away, very much away, from human 
personalities.

27
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:36,783
It was just a adoration, I can say, faith,

28
00:07:36,984 --> 00:07:41,552
but when they said, "We tried to follow 
Them," they could not.

29
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:49,141
They could not follow Them, because I think 
human movement

30
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:58,408
is on parallel lines with the Divine and 
these lines do not meet,

31
00:07:58,609 --> 00:08:04,777
unless and until you give them Self 
Realization.

32
00:08:04,977 --> 00:08:11,871
Human level is moving on another plane

33
00:08:12,072 --> 00:08:17,104
and it has to come up to a higher plane

34
00:08:17,304 --> 00:08:23,639
to understand that what they know is not 
reality.

35
00:08:25,176 --> 00:08:30,128
I wouldn't say what is needed for that,

36
00:08:30,395 --> 00:08:36,941
because in My own experience, all kinds 
of people came to Sahaja Yoga.

37
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:40,744
There’re people described to be very bad, 
cruel

38
00:08:40,945 --> 00:08:44,285
and other ones who were very licentious, 
this, that -

39
00:08:44,486 --> 00:08:50,670
then another ones who were cheats and they 
said, "Mother they are horrible people."

40
00:08:53,179 --> 00:09:02,211
But I've seen that every human being is 
as if made of the same character,

41
00:09:02,412 --> 00:09:09,620
as far as the Spirit is concerned. Outside 
they may be different to look at,

42
00:09:09,821 --> 00:09:15,925
their way of talking may be different, 
their styles may be different,

43
00:09:16,126 --> 00:09:20,232
their fondness for things may be different,

44
00:09:20,433 --> 00:09:26,287
but inside they are all very beautiful.

45
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:33,711
And this I found out, one after another.

46
00:09:33,912 --> 00:09:38,826
You don't know how much it was giving Me 
joy;

47
00:09:39,027 --> 00:09:46,309
not only joy, but also encouragement, 
support and patience.

48
00:09:47,227 --> 00:09:50,779
And then now, you see, how Sahaja Yoga 
has grown.

49
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,017
The greatest thing has now happened is, 
which I realize,

50
00:09:54,218 --> 00:10:01,283
I'm very happy about it, that Sahaja Yogis 
feel very responsible about Sahaja Yoga.

51
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:10,985
And they feel that they have to spread this 
enlightenment everywhere.

52
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:19,452
It's their innate desire now to spread 
Sahaja Yoga.

53
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:24,894
Firstly it was that they should become 
spirits.

54
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:32,539
Before that, also there were some people 
who didn't actually seek the Spirit,

55
00:10:32,739 --> 00:10:40,993
but they also became Sahaja Yogis. And I'm 
surprised, with some of you,

56
00:10:41,192 --> 00:10:45,628
that I never expected that they would go 
so far -

57
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:49,015
and suddenly you hear that such and such 
a person

58
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:53,956
has gone there, has done this, has done 
this.

59
00:10:54,201 --> 00:10:59,469
So, when you came into the realm of reality,

60
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:08,218
I don't know which principle you accepted 
first, that's your understanding.

61
00:11:08,623 --> 00:11:17,497
But one thing you realized that you are 
definitely connected with the Divine.

62
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:29,725
Some people had tremendous experiences, 
some had mild experiences,

63
00:11:29,924 --> 00:11:37,042
but most of them, I saw, started believing 
in themselves,

64
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:46,752
understanding themselves, and having 
confidence about themselves.

65
00:11:47,268 --> 00:11:58,657
Because there are so many myths about God, 
religion, gurus,

66
00:11:59,438 --> 00:12:06,295
that when they saw the light of the Spirit,

67
00:12:06,495 --> 00:12:11,564
which gave them sense of reality,

68
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:18,242
they’re as if they steadied their minds, 
they steadied themselves.

69
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:26,125
All this happened, I must say, in a very 
short time.

70
00:12:26,325 --> 00:12:32,708
I didn't say that it took Me long,

71
00:12:32,907 --> 00:12:37,375
or I had to go through lots of various 
experiences.

72
00:12:37,576 --> 00:12:41,512
Because to Me, all these experiences are 
nothing.

73
00:12:41,713 --> 00:12:48,378
If a ship is seaworthy, it can face all 
kinds of

74
00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:55,177
high tides and all kinds of sharks and 
everything, without any difficulty

75
00:12:55,378 --> 00:13:00,026
because it is seaworthy. So I didn't feel 
that way,

76
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:02,993
but only I felt that from human level

77
00:13:03,193 --> 00:13:09,999
to this spiritual level, to this Divine 
level, when you are coming,

78
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:15,329
then some of that still lingers on,

79
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:21,226
some of that is still there. It has to be 
cleansed,

80
00:13:21,427 --> 00:13:28,918
it has to be brightened, we should say, 
or absolutely enlightened.

81
00:13:29,497 --> 00:13:38,362
But what was the great thing about Sahaja 
Yoga, that you yourself did all that.

82
00:13:38,562 --> 00:13:42,971
It is nice to say, "Mother, You did this, 
You did that."

83
00:13:43,171 --> 00:13:49,778
Maybe enlightenment part of it, but say now 
there are lights here,

84
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:55,586
and these lights, unless and until they are 
attended to, looked after,

85
00:13:55,786 --> 00:14:04,272
and given oil of love, how can they go on 
burning?

86
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:11,240
This is something, what I must say that you 
people somehow or other realized

87
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:18,333
how important it was to become good Sahaja 
Yogis.

88
00:14:21,363 --> 00:14:28,734
Maybe introspection, I don't say, maybe 
somebody else talked about it,

89
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:33,450
maybe it's your own understanding.

90
00:14:33,651 --> 00:14:40,201
Whatever it was, all of you tried to be 
good Sahaja Yogis.

91
00:14:40,401 --> 00:14:46,305
Of course, there are people who are 
sometimes very angry with Me,

92
00:14:46,506 --> 00:14:51,468
like, "Why don't You cure my sister, or why 
don't you cure My father,

93
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:56,381
if you are God?" This, that is there. But 
makes no difference to Me,

94
00:14:56,582 --> 00:15:02,810
because they're so frustrated, so upset, 
so they are talking like that.

95
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:05,327
If you see one or two persons here and 
there,

96
00:15:05,527 --> 00:15:10,994
you see here thousands, such beautiful 
people.

97
00:15:11,194 --> 00:15:20,615
It's complete emancipation of this earth, 
of this globe

98
00:15:20,815 --> 00:15:28,327
I'm sure will take place, if you people all 
take up the responsibility.

99
00:15:29,602 --> 00:15:35,353
The responsibility has certain problems, 
which we should know.

100
00:15:51,363 --> 00:15:57,166
When you feel responsible, you must know

101
00:15:57,367 --> 00:16:03,276
that you are not in charge, one thing.

102
00:16:03,485 --> 00:16:12,399
Secondly, you also must know, that there 
are so many other forces,

103
00:16:12,788 --> 00:16:22,572
so many angels and ganas are with you, 
you are not alone.

104
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:29,073
So to think that you are doing anything

105
00:16:29,273 --> 00:16:34,589
will make you, maybe, egoistical.

106
00:16:34,787 --> 00:16:40,231
At that time, what you have to do, is best 
is to say, "All right,

107
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:45,345
I'm not doing anything, is the Divine that 
is working it out."

108
00:16:46,095 --> 00:16:49,852
Not that the Divine wants any credit from 
you,

109
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:56,649
but by saying that, this balloon of ego 
will not come up.

110
00:16:57,044 --> 00:17:04,753
And you'll become humble and this humility 
will definitely improve

111
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:10,582
this great tree of spirituality within you.

112
00:17:10,818 --> 00:17:20,246
Definitely it will make you a very evolved 
personality,

113
00:17:20,455 --> 00:17:28,869
no doubt about it. But first of all, we 
have to say, "I'm not doing anything".

114
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:38,341
It's very important to understand, when you 
have spiritual authority to do things.

115
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:44,619
It is not a testing ground, I can tell you 
this much. Many people think

116
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:50,962
that Mother is testing us. I'm not testing 
you, you are testing yourself.

117
00:17:51,163 --> 00:17:54,639
I'm not saying don't do this or don't do 
that.

118
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:57,875
You are testing yourself, and now must know

119
00:17:58,075 --> 00:18:03,161
that, you are in the beautiful garden 
of reality,

120
00:18:05,936 --> 00:18:09,431
where very few have entered.

121
00:18:19,649 --> 00:18:23,881
And there in that garden, when you enter,

122
00:18:24,238 --> 00:18:34,935
what do you see? Is, everything is full 
of beauty.

123
00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:42,682
Every person has something sweet about 
himself,

124
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:51,413
because all other Sahaja Yogis are also 
having the same kind of experiences

125
00:18:51,613 --> 00:18:55,848
of this reality, which cannot be described 
in words;

126
00:18:56,048 --> 00:19:00,036
but you start feeling it, that oneness, 
that nearness,

127
00:19:00,237 --> 00:19:06,404
that friendship, without any expectation.

128
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:10,875
You start feeling, "Oh, it's a Sahaja Yogi."

129
00:19:11,075 --> 00:19:16,685
A kind of a completely integrated organism 
as you become;

130
00:19:16,885 --> 00:19:22,166
you become an organization I should say, 
which is a living organization.

131
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:28,030
In that you do not feel you are something 
separate -

132
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:32,438
any Sahaja Yogi, whether he is highly 
placed

133
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:38,200
or he's not doing much in life.

134
00:19:47,101 --> 00:19:50,968
This integration, this oneness,

135
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:55,715
this feeling of identification with others

136
00:19:55,916 --> 00:20:02,207
makes you so large, so big, so great, 
so powerful.

137
00:20:05,064 --> 00:20:11,245
You are not alone, and you say, "I'm not 
doing anything."

138
00:20:12,288 --> 00:20:17,259
So you become so humble that you forget 
all these

139
00:20:17,459 --> 00:20:22,847
false ideas about class consciousness 
or religion consciousness

140
00:20:23,047 --> 00:20:28,247
or I don't know, all sorts of consciousness 
people have.

141
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:33,176
I don't know much about these consciousnesses 
that human beings suffer from,

142
00:20:33,377 --> 00:20:38,757
but I've seen how it happens.

143
00:20:40,301 --> 00:20:47,416
And when that humility becomes your 
character, not that you are humble

144
00:20:47,616 --> 00:20:53,465
because there's something to be done, 
you are humble.

145
00:20:55,302 --> 00:20:57,999
When people are doing some sort of say, 
business,

146
00:20:58,199 --> 00:21:05,033
they will be extremely humble and nice, 
but they will be very unkind otherwise.

147
00:21:05,234 --> 00:21:09,709
Here then, you become absolutely humble

148
00:21:10,111 --> 00:21:14,428
and there's no duality in your personality 
left.

149
00:21:15,888 --> 00:21:19,886
But that doesn't mean you become weak.

150
00:21:20,085 --> 00:21:24,999
Humility is only possible for people who 
are strong,

151
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:34,008
because they don't need any reactions, 
they don't need any protection.

152
00:21:35,715 --> 00:21:40,824
Their humility keeps them protected also, 
very much.

153
00:21:41,753 --> 00:21:48,913
So, you just start thinking or feeling - 
thinking is a funny word -

154
00:21:49,114 --> 00:21:54,981
feeling, that you are a small dust particle.

155
00:21:55,421 --> 00:22:00,531
At the same time you feel you are the whole 
sky.

156
00:22:03,603 --> 00:22:08,717
It depends on you, where you are, what you 
are doing,

157
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:12,823
what you are seeing, what you are 
witnessing.

158
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:25,019
Sometimes you feel that all these big, big 
johnnies are useless.

159
00:22:25,728 --> 00:22:30,448
You feel, "Nothing to worry about them, 
very small,"

160
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:34,707
and with some people you feel you are 
very small.

161
00:22:37,378 --> 00:22:41,417
Such a flexible temperament you developed

162
00:22:41,618 --> 00:22:46,372
and that makes you subtler and subtler,

163
00:22:46,609 --> 00:22:51,222
because you can penetrate into anything, 
any subject,

164
00:22:51,423 --> 00:22:56,072
any personality, any understanding, 
any book,

165
00:22:56,271 --> 00:23:03,273
anything - any enterprise in a very subtle 
manner,

166
00:23:03,474 --> 00:23:11,180
and you immediately see what is to be done, 
because you become so subtle.

167
00:23:13,252 --> 00:23:19,104
And then when you become very great, then 
you start thinking -

168
00:23:19,305 --> 00:23:25,624
or I should say feeling - what you can do 
to help so many people,

169
00:23:25,825 --> 00:23:30,222
to do this great job, to do that.

170
00:23:36,268 --> 00:23:45,281
This, when happens to you, they don't think 
that you are egoistical,

171
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:50,924
nor you should think that you are very 
small.

172
00:23:52,881 --> 00:24:01,592
Only thing is now you are the Spirit and 
Spirit is very subtle.

173
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:10,884
It's a very subtle light, but It can 
penetrate into anything,

174
00:24:11,084 --> 00:24:15,451
It could expand into anything,

175
00:24:16,525 --> 00:24:21,972
It can remain anywhere or It can disappear 
anywhere.

176
00:24:23,072 --> 00:24:31,039
This subtle personality that you are, 
which is your Spirit,

177
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:38,338
you even don't use It, but It uses you 
all the time.

178
00:24:38,538 --> 00:24:44,563
Without your knowledge It uses you. So 
the second thing should be

179
00:24:44,763 --> 00:24:49,769
that you should not determine what you are 
going to do.

180
00:24:50,024 --> 00:24:56,715
"What I have to do - if I have decided, 
I must do like that."

181
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:05,152
Whatever you have decided is all right, 
but if it does not materialize,

182
00:25:05,353 --> 00:25:11,163
there's nothing to worry, there's nothing 
to be upset,

183
00:25:11,362 --> 00:25:18,904
there's nothing to be overly nervous 
about it.

184
00:25:20,287 --> 00:25:23,425
I'll give you an example.

185
00:25:24,546 --> 00:25:31,014
One day I was going to America, and 
of course, you know as it is,

186
00:25:31,215 --> 00:25:36,333
as all the Sahaja Yogis are, they get quite 
worried,

187
00:25:36,533 --> 00:25:40,499
"Now, Mother has to go to America!" I mean, 
you see, everybody's upset,

188
00:25:40,699 --> 00:25:47,107
they are looking at the time, "Now time is 
this, time is that." I was just smiling.

189
00:25:47,308 --> 00:25:52,109
I said, "I have to go to America, why are 
you worried?".

190
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:59,259
And suddenly one of the Sahaja Yogi's child 
fell down and broke her hand

191
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,192
and she couldn't move her fingers.

192
00:26:03,713 --> 00:26:08,817
So, I was just coming out, and as soon as 
he brought the child,

193
00:26:09,017 --> 00:26:14,020
I said "All right, I'm not going just now 
to the airport."

194
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:18,817
They were very upset, "How's She's not 
going to the airport?"

195
00:26:19,017 --> 00:26:23,304
As if all the heavens are going to fall 
down or what?

196
00:26:25,941 --> 00:26:28,636
But I said, "Now, let Me see the child."

197
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:32,133
I treated the child; the child was 
all right.

198
00:26:32,334 --> 00:26:34,997
"All right, I said, let's now go to 
the airport."

199
00:26:35,197 --> 00:26:37,270
And they were saying, "Mother, the plane 
must have left."

200
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:40,935
“It's all right, doesn't matter, let's go 
to the airport."

201
00:26:41,213 --> 00:26:46,057
[We] went to the airport and this plane 
that was going to take Me

202
00:26:46,257 --> 00:26:49,833
was just there because there was something 
wrong with the plane

203
00:26:50,034 --> 00:26:51,773
and there was another plane going 
to Washington,

204
00:26:51,974 --> 00:26:56,890
and I wanted actually to go to Washington, 
instead of New York.

205
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:01,871
So, I was in the plane nicely going 
to Washington.

206
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:07,766
But, one must know that you are not 
doing it,

207
00:27:07,967 --> 00:27:13,773
everything is arranged and planned 
and beautifully kept for you.

208
00:27:13,974 --> 00:27:18,255
You decide something, all right, if your 
decision is all right,

209
00:27:18,454 --> 00:27:20,815
if you have to do that, it will work out.

210
00:27:20,976 --> 00:27:25,554
If it doesn't work out, it should not have 
been worked out.

211
00:27:26,084 --> 00:27:29,480
Now this is the difference between a person 
who is a realized soul

212
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:32,462
and who is not a realized soul.

213
00:27:32,662 --> 00:27:37,733
A realized soul person is not bothered

214
00:27:37,934 --> 00:27:45,100
what he wants, what he likes, what he's 
fond of - he's not.

215
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:49,012
Whatever he gets is all right. Now, you 
can see,

216
00:27:49,213 --> 00:27:55,475
you are living under this roof which is 
so horrible, I mean –

217
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:03,096
there's no proper arrangements here, 
nothing.

218
00:28:03,296 --> 00:28:07,818
I don't know how you are living here, 
I mean, I just don't know what to do.

219
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:11,642
And we are trying to get a land and this 
landowner

220
00:28:11,843 --> 00:28:14,731
is such a greedy fellow, but I don't mind 
the greed part,

221
00:28:14,932 --> 00:28:20,860
but still he's not yet giving us the land. 
It's all right, now what to do?

222
00:28:21,173 --> 00:28:25,356
But you all enjoy it, you don't mind -

223
00:28:25,557 --> 00:28:28,556
otherwise normally people would say, 
"You know, I want

224
00:28:28,757 --> 00:28:33,583
this kind of a room, and I want this kind 
of a house, and this and that."

225
00:28:33,783 --> 00:28:37,431
That you can live under any circumstances

226
00:28:37,631 --> 00:28:44,309
because you don't worry about your physical 
comfort any more.

227
00:28:45,926 --> 00:28:51,220
What you think of - your own spiritual 
comfort.

228
00:28:54,407 --> 00:29:00,343
I have seen people, Sahaja Yogis, 
so beautiful, even children,

229
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:03,497
if there is a film going on - something 
funny comes in,

230
00:29:03,697 --> 00:29:06,509
immediately they all close their eyes, 
"We don't want to see this".

231
00:29:06,709 --> 00:29:10,579
Nobody has to tell them because, you see, 
they are sort of - inside

232
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:18,167
they have built-in that subtle personality 
which cannot stand nonsense.

233
00:29:18,734 --> 00:29:23,338
They won’t - may not say something, they 
may not be harsh,

234
00:29:23,538 --> 00:29:29,549
but just they shun and go away from such 
places, automatically.

235
00:29:29,749 --> 00:29:38,593
So, to describe the new personality is 
this way:

236
00:29:39,064 --> 00:29:44,253
that in the nature we see, very clearly.

237
00:29:44,453 --> 00:29:50,588
In the nature what we see is, a tree grows,

238
00:29:50,982 --> 00:29:57,659
now it has to expand, but it cannot, so 
it does not.

239
00:29:57,859 --> 00:30:06,048
If it can, it will, and also it tries

240
00:30:06,249 --> 00:30:14,688
to bring all the leaves exposed to 
the sunlight, somehow.

241
00:30:15,311 --> 00:30:20,947
I don't think the trees have that much 
intelligence to organize it,

242
00:30:21,148 --> 00:30:26,325
but there is something that organizes 
them so beautifully.

243
00:30:27,134 --> 00:30:32,975
Now, it's not only one tree, thousands and 
thousands and thousands and thousands.

244
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:41,943
The one who does all that, is the one with 
whom you are in contact.

245
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:52,413
The trees are not, they are just playing 
into the hands of nature,

246
00:30:52,614 --> 00:30:58,845
but they cannot manipulate, maneuver, 
understand

247
00:30:59,046 --> 00:31:03,273
this Divine power, they cannot.

248
00:31:04,225 --> 00:31:08,626
Animals cannot, even human beings cannot,

249
00:31:08,827 --> 00:31:16,553
but you can, because you have crossed 
the limit of this human bondage

250
00:31:16,754 --> 00:31:22,915
and now you are just like great citizens

251
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:30,435
of the great realm of divinity.

252
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:37,031
So, this Divine Force helps you, works out 
everything

253
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:45,377
and also It takes you, It guides you, 
It manages you.

254
00:31:45,943 --> 00:31:55,858
So, what you have to do is to keep yourself 
open for the guidance.

255
00:31:56,358 --> 00:32:04,572
At the same time you must act, because 
the guidance will also come from within,

256
00:32:04,772 --> 00:32:10,556
by which you will know, "This is what I 
have to do." Now supposing even then,

257
00:32:10,756 --> 00:32:18,474
you feel that this was not achieved by you 
and you feel that,

258
00:32:19,006 --> 00:32:25,130
"Still I don't know why I couldn't get what 
I wanted."

259
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:30,389
Try to understand that is what is the best 
for us.

260
00:32:30,589 --> 00:32:35,850
But it never means that you should give up,

261
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:41,614
you should not desire. I have seen Sahaja 
Yogis’ desires

262
00:32:41,815 --> 00:32:49,850
are much more powerful than Mine. The reason 
is: I am desireless,

263
00:32:50,305 --> 00:32:54,331
I have no desires as such. Try to see, 
find them out,

264
00:32:54,531 --> 00:33:01,528
if I have any desires. I see I have 
no desires of any kind

265
00:33:01,728 --> 00:33:07,804
or I do not earnestly want anything.

266
00:33:09,785 --> 00:33:14,439
That, you can say it's a very frivolous 
temperament.

267
00:33:15,303 --> 00:33:21,501
But it all, you see, [is] very different 
with you people.

268
00:33:21,762 --> 00:33:27,011
You people are very differently made.

269
00:33:27,212 --> 00:33:30,485
Because you have achieved something.

270
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:47,367
I have not achieved anything. I am what 
I am.

271
00:33:48,315 --> 00:33:51,083
Because you’ve achieved something,

272
00:33:51,284 --> 00:33:58,107
you know how you were and what you are now.

273
00:34:01,082 --> 00:34:09,167
Because of your achievement, I think it is 
a boon that whatever you desire works out.

274
00:34:10,544 --> 00:34:15,172
Because you have worked so hard, it's 
a boon to you,

275
00:34:15,373 --> 00:34:20,483
it's a special blessing for you whatever 
you desire.

276
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:26,107
So… so many times I have told you, "Now 
don't desire anything which is not proper",

277
00:34:26,308 --> 00:34:34,698
because whatever you will desire, that 
works out and that will be effective.

278
00:34:35,182 --> 00:34:41,641
Now try to realize that you are no more 
ordinary human beings.

279
00:34:41,841 --> 00:34:47,299
You have crossed the bondage and now

280
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,836
you are not even in the Sahasrara, you are 
beyond it.

281
00:34:53,665 --> 00:35:00,594
Sahasrara is the limbic area and this 
limbic area is closed

282
00:35:00,794 --> 00:35:09,634
like a lotus and when you get your 
Kundalini entering into it,

283
00:35:09,835 --> 00:35:13,644
then this lotus opens like this.

284
00:35:14,799 --> 00:35:19,822
And that's what is - is written 
in the Bible, that

285
00:35:21,517 --> 00:35:26,628
"I'll appear before you like tongues 
of flames." It's the Divine saying.

286
00:35:26,829 --> 00:35:33,278
So these petals are nothing but nerves 
which are enlightened,

287
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:39,514
just like these, and they look like flames.

288
00:35:39,714 --> 00:35:46,329
But these flames are not with any heat,

289
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:51,747
they call it in Sanskrit tapa-hina, no heat.

290
00:35:51,947 --> 00:35:59,246
Extremely cooling, soothing, beautifully 
burning.

291
00:36:00,938 --> 00:36:06,282
So when this Sahasrara Lotus opens,

292
00:36:06,663 --> 00:36:14,156
then the Kundalini pierces through your 
fontanel and you get your Realization.

293
00:36:16,477 --> 00:36:19,441
This is what has happened to you.

294
00:36:21,162 --> 00:36:26,847
Now only thing is to keep this Lotus open

295
00:36:29,265 --> 00:36:34,652
and there where we fail, sometimes,

296
00:36:34,946 --> 00:36:41,912
because still there are some lingering 
human failings within us.

297
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:50,897
Firstly, it is, as it is, covered with 
the ego and the conditioning,

298
00:36:51,098 --> 00:36:54,715
or we can [say] superego, the two balloons.

299
00:36:54,916 --> 00:37:03,838
These two balloons, again and again, try 
to close the Sahasrara.

300
00:37:09,533 --> 00:37:12,471
So you have to be,

301
00:37:20,364 --> 00:37:23,345
you have to be on the guard,

302
00:37:25,207 --> 00:37:30,917
that "What is closing my Sahasrara?"

303
00:37:32,322 --> 00:37:37,706
The first is ego, which how to attack,

304
00:37:37,907 --> 00:37:43,021
because you want to attack your ego, you'll 
have to attack through ego only,

305
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:46,803
that's the only vehicle.

306
00:37:51,096 --> 00:37:56,590
So, we have this state of Nirvichara,

307
00:37:56,791 --> 00:38:01,313
of thoughtless awareness, where we have 
to go.

308
00:38:03,269 --> 00:38:08,511
But the simple thing to do is very 
practical.

309
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:15,434
Try to understand why you are being 
egoistical, with whom are you angry?

310
00:38:17,732 --> 00:38:20,367
Why are you angry?

311
00:38:21,407 --> 00:38:26,494
What makes you think to dominate someone 
or to control someone

312
00:38:26,695 --> 00:38:29,936
or to check someone? Why?

313
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,219
The mind will not answer.

314
00:38:36,071 --> 00:38:39,436
The simple thing, if you can do,

315
00:38:39,637 --> 00:38:45,353
that whatever things that upsets you or 
makes you feel very great,

316
00:38:46,337 --> 00:38:52,930
try to understand that compared to you, 
nothing is greater.

317
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:58,787
Compared to your love, nothing is greater.

318
00:38:58,987 --> 00:39:02,114
Compared to your compassion, nothing is 
greater

319
00:39:02,315 --> 00:39:07,937
because in this there is the light 
of the Divine flowing.

320
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:14,115
You hate someone, you get angry with 
someone -

321
00:39:14,316 --> 00:39:19,020
just know that you have to love that person.

322
00:39:21,754 --> 00:39:25,789
Now, how will you love that person?

323
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:33,382
There's no way to have any measurement 
of that, but love itself will suggest

324
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:38,973
how satisfied you are feeling, how happy 
you are feeling.

325
00:39:40,977 --> 00:39:46,113
I'll give you an example. The other day 
I received a letter

326
00:39:46,724 --> 00:39:52,284
from someone challenging Me very much, 
from Poland -

327
00:39:52,484 --> 00:39:56,187
that her mother is sick with something, 
cancer or something,

328
00:39:56,388 --> 00:40:00,597
and challenging Me all the time. "If You 
are God, You must create…

329
00:40:00,813 --> 00:40:05,729
cure my mother, if You are God, do this, 
do that, do that ..."

330
00:40:05,983 --> 00:40:08,693
Very amusing.

331
00:40:11,388 --> 00:40:15,920
I said, "All right." I put my attention 
to this lady,

332
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:23,185
perhaps the mother is better. But, instead 
of getting angry, I said,

333
00:40:23,386 --> 00:40:27,173
"She's so frustrated, she's so upset, 
she's so worried,

334
00:40:27,374 --> 00:40:30,177
even if she says, "If You are God," she's 
challenging Me, it's all right,

335
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:31,457
makes no difference.

336
00:40:31,658 --> 00:40:36,901
Whether she calls Me God or not God, 
makes no difference. Whatever I am, I am.

337
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:43,977
So, instead of getting angry, I felt 
tremendous compassion for her.

338
00:40:45,878 --> 00:40:49,409
She's a human being and her mother is 
so sick

339
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:54,865
and that's the only source of her life,

340
00:40:55,066 --> 00:40:59,192
then I can understand why she is so upset.

341
00:41:05,372 --> 00:41:08,237
So, if you just try, which you can do very 
easily,

342
00:41:08,438 --> 00:41:12,557
very easily, it's not difficult,

343
00:41:13,049 --> 00:41:17,682
because you are realized souls, I'm talking 
to saints.

344
00:41:18,205 --> 00:41:27,351
If you just put your attention on a person 
with love,

345
00:41:28,331 --> 00:41:32,275
then what happens, you get understanding.

346
00:41:32,506 --> 00:41:38,913
Understanding of that person, you realize,

347
00:41:40,325 --> 00:41:43,935
as if identified with that person.

348
00:41:44,812 --> 00:41:49,638
Then you realize, "If I was in her place, 
as a human being,

349
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:55,379
what I would have felt? This desperation, 
this anger.

350
00:41:55,580 --> 00:42:00,265
If I was that, if I was the same type 
of person,

351
00:42:00,465 --> 00:42:05,665
with the same kind of problems, then what 
would I do?"

352
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:15,411
That solves the problem. So 
the identification part,

353
00:42:15,612 --> 00:42:19,011
you have such powers, I told you can 
penetrate.

354
00:42:19,212 --> 00:42:23,978
The identification with another is very 
important.

355
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:34,111
And you can do it, because you are 
realized souls, you can do it.

356
00:42:35,353 --> 00:42:40,920
Just place yourself in the same position, 
like the other person is,

357
00:42:42,328 --> 00:42:49,277
and then you'll realize that you have 
powers of love,

358
00:42:49,477 --> 00:42:56,472
and identification is the only way I think 
one can understand love.

359
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:09,180
This ego will immediately sucked in

360
00:43:09,381 --> 00:43:15,990
as soon as you put your loving attention 
on that person.

361
00:43:21,021 --> 00:43:25,770
In your lifetime you'll get so many 
experiences like that,

362
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:36,047
that you'll be amazed at yourself, "How can 
I do all these things?"

363
00:43:36,916 --> 00:43:40,627
Because you are a realized soul.

364
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:48,090
Also, as I said,

365
00:43:50,197 --> 00:43:54,267
when you are identified with another 
person,

366
00:43:54,863 --> 00:44:00,493
you put that person in charge of divinity -

367
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:12,042
just a feeling of oneness.

368
00:44:15,065 --> 00:44:21,980
Sometimes, also, we have very wrong ideas 
about ourselves and about others.

369
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:31,208
In small, small things also, we have our 
own ideas about something.

370
00:44:31,409 --> 00:44:38,657
Say, some sort of a living standard some 
people have, we like it.

371
00:44:38,858 --> 00:44:43,253
"I don't like it, I like it and I don't 
like it."

372
00:44:43,454 --> 00:44:49,259
Not a saint, saint never says that.

373
00:44:50,172 --> 00:44:52,033
That time, when you say that,

374
00:44:52,234 --> 00:44:55,797
you are falsely identifying yourself with 
the baddha of the other person.

375
00:44:55,998 --> 00:44:58,352
For example, the one, now supposing

376
00:44:58,553 --> 00:45:03,770
somebody has done such a beautiful flower 
arrangement.

377
00:45:05,258 --> 00:45:09,011
Instead of appreciating and enjoying it,

378
00:45:09,212 --> 00:45:14,188
if you come and say, "I don't like this, 
this could have been better than this."

379
00:45:18,708 --> 00:45:23,045
Just to sh..(show), I don't know why people 
say like that,

380
00:45:23,807 --> 00:45:26,849
but if you identify yourself with the man 
who has done it,

381
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:30,010
or the gentleman who has done it,

382
00:45:30,752 --> 00:45:35,157
you will enjoy it the way that person 
enjoyed it doing it.

383
00:45:35,808 --> 00:45:40,367
Because you are just thinking about your 
self - self-opinionatedness

384
00:45:40,568 --> 00:45:43,274
with which you think that this is not done 
so good,

385
00:45:43,475 --> 00:45:47,792
that could have been better, this could 
have been better.

386
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:55,288
Who are you to judge anyone?

387
00:46:00,713 --> 00:46:09,412
This criticizing nature comes from 
a terrible misunderstanding about oneself.

388
00:46:10,551 --> 00:46:17,628
What are we? Why should we judge anybody 
else, are we paid for it?

389
00:46:17,829 --> 00:46:21,768
So why waste energy on judging others?

390
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:31,661
We should see what is good in others,

391
00:46:33,586 --> 00:46:37,325
because in the realm of reality, it’s 
all good, everything fine,

392
00:46:37,526 --> 00:46:40,042
everything first class.

393
00:46:42,334 --> 00:46:50,164
But if you are trying to see what's wrong 
with others, then you are not in reality.

394
00:46:52,097 --> 00:46:56,895
You can watch, you can witness,

395
00:46:57,736 --> 00:47:03,230
but you do not get upset with it or you 
do not even say

396
00:47:03,431 --> 00:47:07,284
something that would upset others.

397
00:47:08,286 --> 00:47:11,200
You're watching it, it's all beautiful,

398
00:47:11,401 --> 00:47:16,719
I mean, just the joy of the person who 
put it,

399
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,457
all these beautiful things, of all 
the persons,

400
00:47:20,658 --> 00:47:23,304
is just bubbling through that,

401
00:47:23,505 --> 00:47:28,285
but unless and until you are identified 
with those who have done this,

402
00:47:28,486 --> 00:47:33,474
you might say this was - this should have 
been better, that should have been...

403
00:47:33,815 --> 00:47:36,540
You can be in the same position.

404
00:47:36,741 --> 00:47:39,287
Supposing you do something, another one 
will come and say,

405
00:47:39,487 --> 00:47:42,522
"Oh, you should have done it this way, 
that way." Wasting our energy

406
00:47:42,722 --> 00:47:47,326
for nothing at all, our energy is spiritual 
energy.

407
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:53,128
Then again you become like the sky, 
I told you, the greatest,

408
00:47:53,426 --> 00:47:57,508
you are too great to bother about these 
things.

409
00:47:58,511 --> 00:48:04,629
Wasting our energy on very, very trivial 
things and useless things

410
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:09,171
and just making yourselves small.

411
00:48:11,405 --> 00:48:17,887
But if this spiritual energy is used - 
because you can use it,

412
00:48:18,088 --> 00:48:26,037
you are the ones only who can manipulate 
it, not the trees, not the flowers -

413
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:32,905
then what you will do is to create oceans 
of joys.

414
00:48:34,512 --> 00:48:40,885
So then we come to Sahaj, what has Sahaj 
given you is all right.

415
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:45,611
But what have you given to Sahaja Yoga?

416
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:50,787
What have I given to Sahaja Yoga?

417
00:48:53,644 --> 00:48:57,963
Have I created oceans of joys for others?

418
00:49:03,229 --> 00:49:10,433
What kindness I've shown, what compassion 
I've shown,

419
00:49:10,634 --> 00:49:13,985
what love I have expressed?

420
00:49:14,399 --> 00:49:19,342
All right, whatever Sahaja Yoga has given, 
we have taken it for granted.

421
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:26,898
Once they come to Sahaja Yoga, they think 
it is a contract, already signed,

422
00:49:27,099 --> 00:49:30,956
and if this thing doesn't work out, then 
what is it? They say, "We had a contract

423
00:49:31,156 --> 00:49:36,544
with God," and they say, "We have not 
been awarded fully

424
00:49:36,745 --> 00:49:43,272
for whatever we have paid, whatever we 
have done."

425
00:49:43,569 --> 00:49:46,684
But what have you done

426
00:49:50,382 --> 00:49:54,636
in this realm of reality?

427
00:49:55,184 --> 00:49:58,961
Have you enjoyed the reality?

428
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:10,859
Have you felt the joy of this real love 
of Divine?

429
00:50:13,895 --> 00:50:24,182
Are you dissolved into that, or you're 
still standing on the shores watching?

430
00:50:25,428 --> 00:50:31,064
You can create, you are quite capable 
of creating

431
00:50:31,265 --> 00:50:37,403
tremendous joy, tremendous happiness 
and peace.

432
00:50:37,942 --> 00:50:46,689
See the world today, in what condition 
it is, it's complete turmoil, confusion,

433
00:50:48,619 --> 00:51:02,382
all kinds of corrupt and destructive things 
going on.

434
00:51:03,835 --> 00:51:08,327
So ugly this world has become.

435
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:13,054
Can you beautify it?

436
00:51:15,725 --> 00:51:19,747
You can, because you can transform people.

437
00:51:19,948 --> 00:51:27,419
But if you are not yourself a beautiful 
Sahaja Yogi, how can you?

438
00:51:29,677 --> 00:51:36,205
So, it is our attention on ourselves when 
we work out

439
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:43,734
that we have to bring others into this 
realm of reality.

440
00:51:44,884 --> 00:51:52,081
This is one side ourselves, where we 
have to understand our subtleties.

441
00:51:52,282 --> 00:51:57,431
The another side is that we are still 
identified

442
00:51:57,631 --> 00:52:02,091
with things which we should not have been 
identified.

443
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:07,164
We can just find out.

444
00:52:09,414 --> 00:52:19,027
Identified with ideas, identified with some 
sort of a consciousness.

445
00:52:22,007 --> 00:52:32,237
All these things make you really - to be 
very frank, they befool you.

446
00:52:34,503 --> 00:52:38,452
All the fools, you see,

447
00:52:38,653 --> 00:52:45,212
who are conditioned are really - I don't 
know what to say about them,

448
00:52:45,413 --> 00:52:55,335
because they are like a train which has 
no driver.

449
00:52:56,375 --> 00:52:59,993
God knows when it is going to collide.

450
00:53:00,525 --> 00:53:06,503
Because such people who are identified, 
I know -

451
00:53:06,704 --> 00:53:10,534
now you must have seen also, those who go 
to church,

452
00:53:10,735 --> 00:53:14,396
get ready nicely, go to church, sit down 
there, sing hymns,

453
00:53:14,597 --> 00:53:18,667
come home and again quarrel and fight.

454
00:53:21,203 --> 00:53:25,253
But if they see a church, they'll bow.

455
00:53:25,634 --> 00:53:28,994
But nothing goes inside, out of that 
church.

456
00:53:29,195 --> 00:53:33,236
Or there are, who are like, you see you 
must have seen, the Jews, you see,

457
00:53:33,437 --> 00:53:37,938
wailing wall they have got, before that 
they go, do all kinds of things

458
00:53:38,139 --> 00:53:42,029
and what happens to them? Nothing.

459
00:53:42,332 --> 00:53:46,939
Same with the Muslims, they are so 
conditioned,

460
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:52,535
I mean, you cannot describe their 
conditionings, so stupid they are.

461
00:53:53,265 --> 00:53:58,506
And these conditionings go on making fool 
out of us.

462
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:07,792
I've known so many people like that.

463
00:54:12,046 --> 00:54:20,555
Once in My own life, I was with some 
relation of Mine.

464
00:54:20,756 --> 00:54:24,799
This gentleman used to get up at four 
o'clock

465
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,396
and would start singing some sort of a Ram 
Raksha. The whole house is sleeping,

466
00:54:30,597 --> 00:54:34,381
children are sleeping, he's shouting 
at the top of his voice.

467
00:54:34,582 --> 00:54:40,804
I said, "What is the matter? Even Rama 
might be sleeping at this time."

468
00:54:41,971 --> 00:54:46,424
But he would shout. And his bathing was 
another thing,

469
00:54:46,624 --> 00:54:49,836
everybody knew he's having a bath,

470
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:56,313
because he used to sing another shlokas 
or something. Go on.

471
00:54:56,514 --> 00:55:02,164
But it happened that, that I was 
in the next room,

472
00:55:02,751 --> 00:55:05,260
and I heard something like,

473
00:55:05,461 --> 00:55:08,583
banging, banging, banging. I said, 
"What's the matter?"

474
00:55:08,784 --> 00:55:11,839
I thought he's suffering from epilepsy. 
Or what?

475
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:16,848
So I rushed to other people and told them, 
"This gentleman is suffering from epilepsy."

476
00:55:17,049 --> 00:55:21,163
He says, "No, he doesn't suffer." I said, 
"Then why this sound coming?"

477
00:55:21,364 --> 00:55:27,044
"No, no, he is, he is rubbing that chandan, 
You know, sandalwood."

478
00:55:27,244 --> 00:55:35,032
And with such a big thud every time, he was 
putting that stone on the ground.

479
00:55:35,232 --> 00:55:37,918
"But I thought he had epilepsy."

480
00:55:38,119 --> 00:55:43,249
He said, "Whatever you may tell him, he 
will never listen, he does that every day."

481
00:55:44,943 --> 00:55:48,970
What is this? This we understand 
as stupidity.

482
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:53,185
When we see others, when we see human 
beings,

483
00:55:53,386 --> 00:56:00,398
but even realized souls, you are 
in the realm of reality,

484
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:09,799
you do accept sometimes unreal things. 
Because of age-old conditionings -

485
00:56:10,497 --> 00:56:14,122
your forefathers like this, his father was 
like this, and your forefather's

486
00:56:14,323 --> 00:56:20,960
forefathers were like this, so that's 
still coming. They call it genes.

487
00:56:22,008 --> 00:56:25,852
But in Sahaja Yoga these genes also change.

488
00:56:26,053 --> 00:56:31,403
So this kind of a conditioning which is 
lingering on still

489
00:56:31,604 --> 00:56:37,359
to your bodies, to your minds, to your 
emotions,

490
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:44,993
has to be seen and cleaned out, because 
that kills the joy.

491
00:56:45,707 --> 00:56:50,040
That kills the full experience of reality.

492
00:56:51,606 --> 00:56:56,866
If you want to have a full experience 
of the beauty of reality,

493
00:56:57,067 --> 00:57:01,781
then you should shed out all these things 
which are really befooling you

494
00:57:01,982 --> 00:57:04,780
morning till evening.

495
00:57:05,744 --> 00:57:07,996
People take advantage of such people, 
very much.

496
00:57:08,197 --> 00:57:10,477
As I've told you, entrepreneurs, you see,

497
00:57:10,678 --> 00:57:13,778
they'll start with one fashion, everybody 
goes like that.

498
00:57:13,979 --> 00:57:16,731
But we are not brainless people.

499
00:57:16,932 --> 00:57:21,942
Not that we have brains, but also 
enlightened brains.

500
00:57:22,657 --> 00:57:26,595
We do not take to things which are just 
in the fashion

501
00:57:26,796 --> 00:57:30,511
or which are something, we don't.

502
00:57:33,091 --> 00:57:43,606
What we do, we are of our own fashion.

503
00:57:45,558 --> 00:57:52,663
This is not ego, this is identification 
with your own Spirit.

504
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:57,966
You won't take to anything stupid and 
nonsensical,

505
00:57:58,167 --> 00:58:01,244
if you have the wisdom of your Spirit 
in you.

506
00:58:01,445 --> 00:58:08,032
So, in the realm of reality, we have 
all the seven chakras,

507
00:58:08,233 --> 00:58:15,643
absolutely enlightened, integrated 
and nourished.

508
00:58:17,486 --> 00:58:28,148
At that position what we see is ourselves, 
as I said,

509
00:58:28,349 --> 00:58:36,119
as nothing limited, absolutely unlimited.

510
00:58:37,941 --> 00:58:43,298
Even (is/if) - when we say, we penetrate, 
we do.

511
00:58:43,499 --> 00:58:49,437
When we say we expand, we do. When we 
contract, we do.

512
00:58:49,638 --> 00:58:54,469
It's absolutely a flexible personality

513
00:58:54,670 --> 00:59:05,379
and a personality that creates peace, joy, 
harmony.

514
00:59:08,454 --> 00:59:15,367
With the Sahasrara opening, I'm sure 
the whole world would be integrated,

515
00:59:16,922 --> 00:59:23,914
one day, and we’ll understand these problems

516
00:59:24,115 --> 00:59:32,803
that are facing us because of stupidity.

517
00:59:34,632 --> 00:59:38,842
This integration I'm sure will take place,

518
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:49,717
and when that takes place, you'll see 
the life of the Divine

519
00:59:50,233 --> 00:59:59,970
will be absolutely outshining all these 
darknesses or destructive forces.

520
01:00:00,374 --> 01:00:03,364
It's going to happen.

521
01:00:03,943 --> 01:00:08,766
If so many Sahasraras could be opened out,

522
01:00:08,967 --> 01:00:14,848
then why not the Sahasrara of this world 
also is opened out

523
01:00:15,049 --> 01:00:20,759
to truth and reality? It will.

524
01:00:21,331 --> 01:00:26,335
So today, on such an important day for us,

525
01:00:26,536 --> 01:00:33,104
in the history of spirituality, I think 
this is a very important day.

526
01:00:33,305 --> 01:00:43,104
For us is to realize that we are 
enlightened, we are the light of joy,

527
01:00:43,305 --> 01:00:49,391
light of compassion, light of love

528
01:00:51,419 --> 01:01:00,170
like the silent flames of the Sahasrara, 
in different colors, beautifully dancing.

529
01:01:00,813 --> 01:01:08,684
Then we'll know what is the enjoyment 
of reality is.

530
01:01:09,549 --> 01:01:13,085
May God bless you.

531
01:01:59,811 --> 01:02:02,985
Yogi: Shri Ganesha mantra 3 times.

532
01:16:53,933 --> 01:16:56,282
Yogi: “All the leaders”.

533
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:27,848
Yogi: So, with the permission of Shri 
Mataji, we are going to recite together

534
01:18:28,049 --> 01:18:33,341
the 108 Thank You's to our Divine Mother

535
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:39,413
which have been composed for this occasion 
of Sahasrara Puja.

536
01:18:39,614 --> 01:18:44,715
And we are going to perform it the way 
that the mantra is read,

537
01:18:44,916 --> 01:18:52,887
and after the mantra we all say together, 
"Thank You, Shri Mataji, again and again."

538
01:18:55,880 --> 01:19:00,451
1) Thank You for descending from Your 
heavenly abode, Mata Dwipa,
