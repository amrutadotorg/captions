1
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:14,440
While worshipping Shri Ganesha you have to know

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:21,280
that such a powerful thing

3
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,800
you have to establish within yourself

4
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,440
and by that establishment

5
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:41,240
you have to manifest the powers of Shri Ganesha

6
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,080
and the power of Shri Ganesha's

7
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,200
greatness is auspiciousness.

8
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,960
It's a coefficience;

9
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,840
it's a formula, we can say in scientific language,

10
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,680
that emits auspiciousness.

11
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:29,680
It's a magnet in the Mother Earth.

12
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,760
The same magnet is within you,

13
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,040
which is Shri Ganesha.

14
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,800
You leave Me alone and I can tell you

15
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:47,440
which is the north, south, east, west.

16
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,280
Close My eyes, still I'll tell you.

17
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,600
You know there are so many birds who fly out

18
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,720
all the way to Australia, to Siberia

19
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,120
because they have that magnet with them,

20
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,440
they have that innocence with them.

21
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,400
There are so many fishes,

22
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,520
which have got actual magnet placed in them.

23
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,880
Scientists should find out.

24
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:21,160
In the same way Shri Ganesha within us is magnetic.

25
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:30,960
So a person who has Shri Ganesha awakened within himself

26
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,080
becomes magnetic

27
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:48,120
and magnet attracts the steel

28
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,920
-- not dried leaves, does not -- steel.

29
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,840
And steel is like the Guru Tattwa.

30
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,880
Is a man with the steel, say.

31
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,560
"Man of steel" -- a person who has character, conviction

32
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,800
and who cannot be dominated by temptations,

33
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,600
is a man of steel.

34
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:27,240
So this magnet attracts the steel.

35
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:34,640
Steel has only one badness, bad thing about it that it is

36
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,080
not pliable, it's rather dry

37
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:49,240
but the magnet attracts, means

38
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:55,600
it creates that special quality in the steel

39
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,640
that it moves towards the magnet.

40
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,680
In the same way when this magnet is awakened within you,

41
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,080
you'll be amazed.

42
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,960
Instead of people running away from your ashrams

43
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,000
they'll be running towards you.

44
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,480
I find it impossible. I go to any house,

45
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,040
if they come to know I am there, God save Me

46
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:33,000
-- anywhere, any place.

47
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,840
So what is this magnet?

48
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,240
Is pure love.

49
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,360
Is pure love

50
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,440
and the concept of pure love is that it doesn't depend

51
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,720
on anything whatsoever but on itself.

52
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,080
It is the support of itself.

53
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,720
It's like light that spreads just by its own nature,

54
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,360
doesn't want anything,

55
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,640
doesn't expect anything.

56
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,680
Just spreads all over and enlightens other people's hearts.

57
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,840
That's why they get attracted.

58
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,560
Those who have not even seen Me,

59
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,000
those who have not even known Me,

60
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,200
just with My name, I've seen,

61
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,400
places like Calcutta, we had such a problem, such crowds

62
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,360
that they said, "We have to call the police".

63
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,680
I said, "There's no need to call the police but

64
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,600
we'll manage somehow."

65
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,360
In Poona we had such crowds

66
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,920
that the fellow who gave us the hall got a fright.

67
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,520
He said, "Mother, I'll give You very big area

68
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,560
where You can sit down in a big open place

69
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,960
but I am sorry, my hall all will be finished."

70
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,120
I said, "You don't worry,

71
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,160
everything will be in proper place."

72
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,960
We had such crowds that people were sitting on the ground,

73
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,920
on the staircase, everywhere and till I spoke

74
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:19,160
nobody moved an inch, you see like a picture.

75
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,720
And I spoke for one and a half hour.

76
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,800
Just like a picture.

77
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,880
No movement of hand, feet, eyes -- nothing.

78
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,200
Just sitting like a picture.

79
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,280
And the gentleman who owned that hall

80
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,520
had never seen such a thing before.

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,280
Throughout for one and half hour,

82
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,760
no movement of any kind.

83
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,640
What is it, that working, is the magnet.

84
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,960
Even if you are the steel, it will attract

85
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,680
but if you are a magnet then it will attract

86
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:08,560
in such a way that it will never leave this magnet.

87
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,440
So, for yoga it is important that you fix up your magnets

88
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:25,440
of Shri Ganesha who is the child-like personality.

89
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,600
A child, there's one child,

90
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,240
everybody is attracted towards the child.

91
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,120
One child gets stuck-up somewhere in the air,

92
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:42,480
whether you are a Russian, American or an Arab,

93
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,600
everybody would be worried about the child.

94
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,120
What's happening to the child?

95
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,200
They will not think: it's an Arab child or an American child, no.

96
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,120
Unless and until it's a devil.

97
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,680
Why this attraction for children?

98
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,600
Because their magnets are intact.

99
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,240
Their ego has not yet developed.

100
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,840
Our ego developed, had to develop

101
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,960
because we had to decide in our own freedom,

102
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,440
what is right and what is wrong.

103
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,400
So the ego developed was all right.

104
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,320
Up to a point we should have developed our ego.

105
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,000
But we overdeveloped it and overdeveloped it,

106
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
overlapped the superego also.

107
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,240
No conditioning, nothing.

108
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,400
We'll do whatever we like.

109
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,760
Today we are wearing a half-pant,

110
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,360
tomorrow we will wear a long pant, all right.

111
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,720
Then we'll cut our hair or we'll do this, we'll do that.

112
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,080
No conditioning of any kind.

113
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:53,560
All superego was also covered -- ego.

114
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,520
This ego would have been all right

115
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,200
if you had kept your Ganesha tattwa.

116
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,400
And what is that is the wisdom power of Ganesha.

117
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:17,960
The second power of Ganesha is that He gives you wisdom.

118
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:24,160
If you see a farmer and a big professor

119
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,400
or a very well educated man

120
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,880
and talk to both of them. You'll find the farmer

121
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:37,280
has much more wisdom than this, MAD PhD.

122
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,280
Why? Because he deals with Mother Earth everyday.

123
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,240
He knows the living process.

124
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,760
He knows about the innocence of the Mother Earth.

125
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:57,320
So an innocent person is the wisest among ...

126
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:04,400
A child who is innocent is much wiser than

127
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,800
ten ego-oriented people.

128
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,440
So the second capacity of Shri Ganesha

129
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,160
is that you become a wise person.

130
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,280
When you speak, people start looking at you.

131
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,240
You speak like Kabira, you speak like Nanaka.

132
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:42,680
You speak like something that makes people feel their spirit.

133
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,160
This is what I call is a Sahaja yogi.

134
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,160
A Sahaja yogi who does not have wisdom

135
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,680
is good for nothing.

136
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,360
He comes to Sahaja Yoga

137
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,200
and he is like a bull in a china shop,

138
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,760
goes on hitting this person, hitting that person

139
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,640
and hitting that person.

140
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,520
And when you ask these three wounded persons,

141
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,560
they say, "That bull, the same bull".

142
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,840
Everybody reports about the same bull.

143
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,600
"Oh, that's the one, all right."

144
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,320
So it grants you wisdom.

145
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,960
When you have the power of Shri Ganesha,

146
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,440
your eyes are radiant.

147
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,160
You get a spark in your eye, a light in your eye,

148
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,640
when He is enlightening you;

149
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:54,840
then you cannot look at anyone with lust and greed.

150
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,680
But this glance is so powerful

151
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,400
that even one glance is sufficient

152
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,760
to purify thousands of people.

153
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,040
Just the opening of the eyes are necessary

154
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,560
and you find whole thing changes

155
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,200
into a beautiful morning

156
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:28,720
from a complete dark night.

157
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,880
Glance can awaken the Kundalini.

158
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,920
The Mother Kundalini cannot move,

159
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,920
unless and until Shri Ganesha gives the permission.

160
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,440
He is like the Vice-Chancellor sitting on all the chakras.

161
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:59,400
He has to certify, "All right. Pass. Go," on every chakra.

162
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,040
And when the Kundalini rises,

163
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,240
Shri Ganesha is awakened, otherwise Kundalini cannot rise.

164
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,720
But then when He sleeps down,

165
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:16,240
Kundalini sucks, is sucked by Him.

166
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,720
Now we think we have lost our innocence.

167
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,040
That's not easy to be lost. It is not destructible.

168
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:36,120
Only thing what you have done is to cover it

169
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:43,080
with something that cannot allow

170
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,640
Shri Ganesha's principle to manifest in us.

171
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,520
You have pushed it down. You have brought pressure on it.

172
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,840
You have brought loads and loads of nonsense on it.

173
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,360
That's all, but it never dies.

174
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:11,960
It is an eternal principle of the whole universe.

175
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,440
The another quality of a person who is endowed

176
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,680
with Shri Ganesha's powers is that

177
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,640
He removes all the hurdles.

178
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,720
If one person of this nature is in some place,

179
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,600
all the rest of the people who are nearby

180
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,480
will be saved if there's an accident or if there's any problem,

181
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,480
which is destructive, all of them will be saved.

182
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,040
You will find this happening.

183
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:05,440
He being the Ganapati, He is now the Master of all the Ganas.

184
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,200
He guides you.

185
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,560
Sahaja yoga cannot workout without Shri Ganesha.

186
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,840
He is the one who is Sahaja.

187
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,680
He is the one who creates all spontaneity of the world.

188
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,640
He is the one who takes you to the right path.

189
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,240
He is the one who gives you everything easily.

190
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,800
He is the one who creates all the chamatkars,

191
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:38,960
all the magic, all the miracles of the world.

192
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:46,880
He is the Ganapati. He is the one who is sitting on Ganas,

193
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:55,000
in the sense that He is like the king of all the Ganas.

194
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,200
The one who has pleased Shri Ganesha

195
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,200
has pleased all the Gods and Goddesses

196
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,440
because all the Gods and Goddesses

197
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,840
are pleasing Shri Ganesha, so what is the need?

198
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,440
And Shri Ganesha is very clever.

199
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,240
He knows,

200
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:23,120
please His Mother is the only simple thing He has to do.

201
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,240
To have all the powers of the world,

202
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,040
just keep the Mother pleased.

203
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,280
There are so many qualities of Shri Ganesha,

204
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,760
which can be described.

205
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,200
He is the one who gives us the joy of eating.

206
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:57,120
If you eat some food, you may like it, you may not like it

207
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,120
but He is the one who will tell you

208
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,120
this is made by Sahaja yogis, made by your Mother.

209
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,760
That means He gives you the taste of love

210
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,360
in the food that is cooked for you.

211
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,280
Because He is love.

212
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,800
He gives you the ideas how to express your love.
