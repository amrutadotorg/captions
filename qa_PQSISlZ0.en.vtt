00:16.839 --> 00:22.810
now first before meditate in your heart

00:23.769 --> 00:38.600
you should see in your heart

00:28.460 --> 00:44.720
and then try to put your guru in the

00:38.600 --> 00:54.190
core of it after establishing in the

00:44.720 --> 00:54.190
heart we must bow to that

00:58.050 --> 01:05.510
with full devotion and dedication now

01:02.910 --> 01:11.160
whatever you do with your mind after

01:05.510 --> 01:15.950
realization is not imagination because

01:11.160 --> 01:23.580
now your mind your imagination is itself

01:15.950 --> 01:28.710
enlightened so project yourself in such

01:23.580 --> 01:32.000
a way that you humble down at the feet

01:28.710 --> 01:35.079
of your guru

01:32.000 --> 01:35.079
[Music]

01:37.170 --> 01:41.970
and now a squirrel

01:45.700 --> 01:57.659
the necessary temperament needed for

01:52.270 --> 01:57.659
meditation or atmosphere needed for

01:57.780 --> 02:11.200
meditation meditation is when you are

02:02.710 --> 02:16.600
one with the divine now if there are

02:11.200 --> 02:19.720
thoughts coming in first you have to say

02:16.600 --> 02:26.890
the first month of course and then watch

02:19.720 --> 02:31.209
inside also you must say mantra of

02:26.890 --> 02:34.440
Ganesha will help some people and then

02:31.209 --> 02:34.440
you should watch inside

02:38.290 --> 02:49.739
and see for yourself which is the

02:42.700 --> 02:49.739
biggest hurdle for the part

02:51.940 --> 02:59.470
now for the thought you have to say the

02:55.240 --> 03:05.520
mantra of nearly Chara that Thomas

02:59.470 --> 03:09.400
akshar need which are sakshat shri

03:05.520 --> 03:12.000

03:09.400 --> 03:12.000
say thrice

03:29.910 --> 03:32.960
[Music]

03:47.600 --> 03:53.070
now we come to the hurdle of your ego

03:50.850 --> 03:54.810
because see your thought has stopped now

03:53.070 --> 03:59.850
no doubt but there's still the pressure

03:54.810 --> 04:04.430
on the head so if it is ego you have to

03:59.850 --> 04:08.880
say so many visage are MOT ahankara

04:04.430 --> 04:12.330
Mahatma is a great economy the ego Sasha

[Music]

04:47.370 --> 04:53.630
[Music]

04:57.600 --> 05:05.790
now even now if you find that ego is

05:01.540 --> 05:09.520
still there then you have to raise your

05:05.790 --> 05:12.340
left side to push it back to the right

05:09.520 --> 05:19.570
hand side with your hand one hand

05:12.340 --> 05:22.780
towards the photograph push the left

05:19.570 --> 05:26.910
side higher and right side lower so the

05:22.780 --> 05:26.910
ego and super-ego get the balance

05:34.200 --> 05:42.950
do it seven times try to feel how you

05:39.450 --> 05:42.950
are feeling inside is it

05:54.560 --> 06:06.290
now you raise your Kundalini up on the

06:00.140 --> 06:14.420
head and tighter again raise your

06:06.290 --> 06:29.350
Kundalini up on the head and start again

06:14.420 --> 06:32.540
they joyfully and tighter now at the

06:29.350 --> 06:35.169
