00:00.680 --> 00:07.419
Actually Christians do not know anything about
His becoming.

00:07.419 --> 00:14.860
How He became Christ or what was the need
to have Christ or a son to come down.

00:14.860 --> 00:16.890
Why not God Himself could do the job.

00:16.890 --> 00:24.830
And this is the reason why I would request
you to read for yourself the incarnation of

00:24.830 --> 00:27.550
Maha Vishnu by which you realize why Christ
was born.

00:27.550 --> 00:40.890
And it is the most important incarnation because
He is the principle.

00:40.890 --> 00:43.500
He is the principle of creation.

00:43.500 --> 00:47.510
The Tattwa as they call it in Sanskrit language.

00:47.510 --> 00:48.910
He is the tattwa.

00:48.910 --> 00:58.559
Ganesha, who resides in the Mooladhara gradually
evolves to be Christ at this stage.

00:58.559 --> 01:07.270
From that red Chakra up to this Chakra He
became the Christ.

01:07.270 --> 01:08.840
He is the principle.

01:08.840 --> 01:12.580
Now what is the principle?

01:12.580 --> 01:17.060
Within us what is our principle?

01:17.060 --> 01:20.030
Is say the Kundalini you can say?

01:20.030 --> 01:25.090
In this the electricity is the principle of
this one is.

01:25.090 --> 01:32.530
In the same way the creation, the whole creation
if you take it as such, it is the principle

01:32.530 --> 01:37.189
and the support of this creation.

01:37.189 --> 01:49.729
He represents the essence, the essence of
creation.

01:49.729 --> 01:55.979
Like we can say we have a family, husband
and wife and the child.

01:55.979 --> 02:02.009
Now the child is the essence of husband and
wife.

02:02.009 --> 02:08.060
He is the essence of the family, of the house.

02:08.060 --> 02:11.209
The whole thing is sustained for him, is created
for him.

02:11.209 --> 02:19.530
Till they did not have the child there was
no meaning to that house, no meaning to their

02:19.530 --> 02:20.530
life.

02:20.530 --> 02:23.340
But when they had a child then they had a
meaning.

02:23.340 --> 02:25.980
In the same way Christ is the essence, is
the tattwa itself.

02:25.980 --> 02:28.279
He’s the Omkara as they call it.

02:28.279 --> 02:39.209
He is the first sound, first sound that was
created AUM when the Primordial Father and

02:39.209 --> 02:43.099
Primordial Mother separated, They created
this sound.

02:43.099 --> 02:52.780
And He is that sound which is filled into
All-Pervading Power and looks after and support,

02:52.780 --> 02:58.059
actually it is more the support because looking
after is done by the father you can say or

02:58.059 --> 02:59.059
by the mother.

02:59.059 --> 03:03.989
But is the support of all the universe.

03:03.989 --> 03:10.889
And because He is just the essence, the essence
never dies.

03:10.889 --> 03:19.309
Say My essence is My Spirit, it will never
die.

03:19.309 --> 03:24.629
The body dies or the creation will die but
the essence has to be there.

03:24.629 --> 03:29.859
If the essence is lost then nothing could
be there that’s why He is the most important

03:29.859 --> 03:31.389
incarnation.

03:31.389 --> 03:35.230
Because He is the support.

03:35.230 --> 03:41.159
Now this incarnation is placed in this Agnya
Chakra of ours.

03:41.159 --> 03:46.549
Here in the center where the optic nerve or
optic thalamus cross each other like this.

03:46.549 --> 03:53.959
In the center is a very subtle point which
moves both the sides like this and like that

03:53.959 --> 04:01.650
and it creates two sounds Ham Ksham, Ham Ksham,
Ham Ksham.

04:01.650 --> 04:10.150
Ham is on the right hand side where you have
seen the superego is there and Ksham is on

04:10.150 --> 04:14.089
the left hand side where the ego is.

04:14.089 --> 04:19.739
Now these two sounds create two kinds of vibrations.

04:19.739 --> 04:32.280
The Ham sound creates the vibrations, which
make you think, “I am, I am.

04:32.280 --> 04:34.990
Ham, I am.”

04:34.990 --> 04:40.560
This comes from our existence power that we
know we have to live in this world, we’re

04:40.560 --> 04:41.650
not going to die.

04:41.650 --> 04:46.930
Any human being who tries to kill himself
is abnormal.

04:46.930 --> 04:54.870
Normally every human being, why every animal
or any living thing tries to retain its life.

04:54.870 --> 05:00.590
That is through this power of Ham that I am.

05:00.590 --> 05:05.759
Now the superego on the left hand side and
ego on the right hand side is Ksham.

05:05.759 --> 05:09.400
But now I’ll tell you about the right hand
side superego.

05:09.400 --> 05:21.060
In this superego when you are conditioned
by so many things, then you are frightened

05:21.060 --> 05:28.800
and you are worried because these experiences
make you that type of a person which has fear

05:28.800 --> 05:30.250
in the mind.

05:30.250 --> 05:34.840
And this fear is all settled in your superego.

05:34.840 --> 05:40.370
This starts from your amoeba stage you can
say and is still today is being stored there.

05:40.370 --> 05:44.333
You are afraid of police, you are afraid of
that, you are afraid of this.

05:44.333 --> 05:47.879
Some people are not afraid of these things
but are afraid of something else.

05:47.879 --> 05:55.999
Because whatever have been your conditions,
whatever have been your experiences are all

05:55.999 --> 05:57.130
put down here.

05:57.130 --> 06:01.550
Moreover when somebody reads the book of “Dracula”
now he’s afraid of the word Dracula but

06:01.550 --> 06:04.770
the children who do not read they do not know
what is a Dracula is.

06:04.770 --> 06:08.060
If you say Dracula has come they say all right
lets have a look at him.

06:08.060 --> 06:13.849
But those children have read about Dracula,
they are literally frightened and they say,

06:13.849 --> 06:16.650
“Oh God, Dracula is coming, something terrible
is going to happen.”

06:16.650 --> 06:21.419
So you see whatever you have read, whatever
you have gone through whatever experiences

06:21.419 --> 06:24.740
you have had all is in the superego.

06:24.740 --> 06:36.690
So this superego in that this center sends
message, I am, you are, you are Ham, Ham don’t

06:36.690 --> 06:41.249
be afraid, don’t be afraid, you are.

06:41.249 --> 06:46.650
So the people who come to Me, you have seen
some people who come to Me are victims of

06:46.650 --> 06:52.849
superego conditioning And these are the people,
actually at this stage only you can really

06:52.849 --> 06:56.439
discriminate between the two types.

06:56.439 --> 07:05.229
One who are very aggressive, the other who
are absolutely we should say subordinated,

07:05.229 --> 07:06.389
frightened.

07:06.389 --> 07:11.380
These people when they come to Me I have seen,
they go on crying and weeping, “Mother you

07:11.380 --> 07:16.650
know this has happened that has happened,”
and I really get tired talking to them.

07:16.650 --> 07:23.810
And there are so many of this kind that really
you have to pay attention to them as Sahaja

07:23.810 --> 07:28.699
Yogis because you’ll have to deal with them,
how to manage them and how to work it out.

07:28.699 --> 07:36.080
Now at that time if a Sahaja Yogi says, now
you go on saying Ham, Ham, Ham, Ham, a Sahaja

07:36.080 --> 07:41.370
Yogi if he says then the vibrations will drive
out his fear.

07:41.370 --> 07:46.960
Even if you are under any fear and you are
walking around and you feel that there’s

07:46.960 --> 07:50.819
frightened, you just say Ham, Ham, Ham.

07:50.819 --> 07:55.669
Now with this saying the vibrations will clear
out this side very nicely.

07:55.669 --> 08:02.110
Apart from that, that is the way you can get
help from the Divine by saying Ham.

08:02.110 --> 08:07.330
Now there are many things about Ham and Ksham
but as the time is you know, so I do not want

08:07.330 --> 08:09.090
to go into great details about it.

08:09.090 --> 08:14.870
But I would say the mantra for the right hand
side is Ham and for the left hand side is

08:14.870 --> 08:15.870
Ksham.

08:15.870 --> 08:24.449
The right hand side is the ego, which is real
problem, you understand that, is a real colossal

08:24.449 --> 08:27.650
one you have to face them, I mean.

08:27.650 --> 08:32.610
I say anything small here and there I find
the whole thing coming up onto my head like

08:32.610 --> 08:33.610
that.

08:33.610 --> 08:36.099
So what is the solution for a colossal ego?

08:36.099 --> 08:44.450
Colossal ego can only be conquered by forgiving
others.

08:44.450 --> 08:53.640
Those who have ego must learn if they feel
hurt they must say, “forgive.”

08:53.640 --> 08:56.810
Then another person hurts them, say, “forgive.”

08:56.810 --> 09:00.230
And not only forgive but ask for forgiveness.

09:00.230 --> 09:04.180
Both things should be done, more asking for
forgiveness.

09:04.180 --> 09:07.370
You have to ask for forgiveness if you have
too much of ego.

09:07.370 --> 09:08.370
It is very important.

09:08.370 --> 09:12.570
Because if you have too much of ego means
what?

09:12.570 --> 09:15.410
That you have pampered it too much.

09:15.410 --> 09:17.310
That means you have used it too much.

09:17.310 --> 09:22.410
You have dominated people and that’s why
you have such a lot of ego.

09:22.410 --> 09:28.480
If you have such a lot of ego you must all
the time try to humble down in your heart.

09:28.480 --> 09:32.760
Now in the heart resides the spirit.

09:32.760 --> 09:38.060
The ego, too much of ego in a person always
takes you away from that spirit.

09:38.060 --> 09:41.560
That’s why it is said, “Humble down in
your heart.”

09:41.560 --> 09:49.310
The reason is, in the heart resides that part
of yours which gets completely obliterated

09:49.310 --> 09:52.850
or forgotten once you start pumping up your
ego.

09:52.850 --> 10:00.610
But ego has its limits, it ends up into stupidity
and foolishness.

10:00.610 --> 10:06.430
You take any person who is egoistical and
who’s blowing his own trumpet.

10:06.430 --> 10:09.540
You will immediately know because he’ll
be stupid.

10:09.540 --> 10:16.260
Without understanding what he’s doing he’ll
be doing such stupid things that you will

10:16.260 --> 10:21.529
start wondering, especially children, “What’s
the matter with this fellow, he is quite funny?”

10:21.529 --> 10:29.990
And then the stupidity you see faces the person
then he sees for himself, “Oh God!

10:29.990 --> 10:32.070
how did I become so stupid?”

10:32.070 --> 10:38.250
The stupidity comes to you because you forget
the existence of God and your relationship

10:38.250 --> 10:41.260
with the whole.

10:41.260 --> 10:44.680
You think, “I am on my own.

10:44.680 --> 10:46.120
Why should I not do this?

10:46.120 --> 10:48.529
What is wrong in this, what is wrong in that?

10:48.529 --> 10:49.730
I should do these things.”

10:49.730 --> 10:53.410
I mean in this country the way people are
fighting for things.

10:53.410 --> 10:58.310
I mean you must, anybody I mean, those so-called
developing countries can’t understand what

10:58.310 --> 11:00.880
kind of a thing happening to these people.

11:00.880 --> 11:09.089
Because the other day My son-in-law Lav was
reading an article that people are demanding

11:09.089 --> 11:11.959
now that the son-in-law should be allowed
to marry the mother-in-law.

11:11.959 --> 11:17.800
And he just couldn’t understand how can
people gather together and ask for such an

11:17.800 --> 11:19.089
absurd thing like that.

11:19.089 --> 11:20.380
She is your mother.

11:20.380 --> 11:21.890
How can you say that way?

11:21.890 --> 11:27.380
I mean it is something an impossibility for
people, normal people to think like that.

11:27.380 --> 11:28.930
That a son-in-law can marry the mother-in-law.

11:28.930 --> 11:33.769
And what is there to make a law about it and
to talk about it.

11:33.769 --> 11:35.410
It’s a very difficult thing.

11:35.410 --> 11:40.300
All kinds of stupid things we are doing in
this country, which really makes everybody

11:40.300 --> 11:42.240
roar with laughter.

11:42.240 --> 11:47.029
Is because of our Mr. Ego companionship.

11:47.029 --> 11:51.139
It is not easy to understand how he befools
us.

11:51.139 --> 11:57.240
It goes on befooling us all the time and then
we think what’s wrong?

11:57.240 --> 12:01.230
An eighty-year-old man running after a twenty-year-old
girl.

12:01.230 --> 12:06.620
And the twenty-year-old girl befooling this
eighty-year-old man, supposed to be a statesman

12:06.620 --> 12:10.449
this, that and his statue is erected somewhere
there.

12:10.449 --> 12:13.030
How is it possible?

12:13.030 --> 12:20.459
It is only the ego makes you do all these
nonsensical and stupid things.

12:20.459 --> 12:24.510
Once you are in Sahaja Yoga you don’t know
how to control your laughter sometimes the

12:24.510 --> 12:26.190
way people are foolish.

12:26.190 --> 12:27.319
Extremely foolish.

12:27.319 --> 12:33.180
And this is what it is; it ends up in stupidity
absolute stupidity.

12:33.180 --> 12:39.420
I mean even if you want to write a novel you
won’t get such beautiful characters as you

12:39.420 --> 12:40.449
could around you, when you listen to them.

12:40.449 --> 12:46.100
And you’re shocked, Oh God what’s this
going on and very embarrassing too.

12:46.100 --> 12:56.900
Extremely embarrassing and they become so
foolish with their ego that one cannot understand

12:56.900 --> 13:04.120
how thinking man, because by thinking you
get your ego, becomes foolish.

13:04.120 --> 13:11.220
There is no wisdom in a person whose ego is
completely developed like that.

13:11.220 --> 13:16.019
If somebody has an ego like that there is
no wisdom in him.

13:16.019 --> 13:19.950
You can see that he does not know what is
wisdom.

13:19.950 --> 13:22.430
He behaves in such an immature way.

13:22.430 --> 13:27.930
He may be an elderly man, great grandfather
of somebody but as soon as he opens his mouth

13:27.930 --> 13:29.350
you are shocked at him.

13:29.350 --> 13:33.190
You think from where this joker has come?

13:33.190 --> 13:35.060
The maturity is completely lacking.

13:35.060 --> 13:41.029
The other day somebody told Me that, “Mother
how is it our parents are so stupid and we

13:41.029 --> 13:42.589
are searching God?

13:42.589 --> 13:48.360
And the elderly people are so foolish and
we are searching God?”

13:48.360 --> 13:51.629
And then I said, “No, maybe because of war
the parents are disturbed, you see”.

13:51.629 --> 13:55.850
Most of the parents were disturbed during
war and they said, “Majority of them are

13:55.850 --> 13:57.310
like this.

13:57.310 --> 14:01.699
And the younger people are searching God and
much wiser and we don’t know how to compromise

14:01.699 --> 14:04.640
with them because they are not searching God.

14:04.640 --> 14:07.699
Why is it they are not searching God and we
are searching God?

14:07.699 --> 14:11.080
And if there are some searching, they are
very few.”

14:11.080 --> 14:15.360
Now I said this may be due to war but somebody
said, “Then what about America?

14:15.360 --> 14:19.879
You see, in America the people didn’t face
war so much, the stupidity that they have

14:19.879 --> 14:21.190
is sometimes surprising.”

14:21.190 --> 14:30.490
That is the same thing as I said, is the development
of ego in a human being.

14:30.490 --> 14:35.389
Now ego is the thing that makes you think
about everything.

14:35.389 --> 14:42.310
For example, now we have to, say go from here
to Birmingham, all right.

14:42.310 --> 14:45.340
So we think now how will I go?

14:45.340 --> 14:51.220
Simple way is that I’ll take a train or
I’ll take a car and go away.

14:51.220 --> 14:54.300
If there’s no reservation needed I will
just jump into the train or going by the car.

14:54.300 --> 14:56.779
If the car is available I’ll go by car or
by train finished.

14:56.779 --> 14:58.680
What is there to think about?

14:58.680 --> 15:04.190
But no, then we must plan it out, “I’m
programmed now I have to go”.

15:04.190 --> 15:09.029
You go to the station and find the train is
not there because there was some accident

15:09.029 --> 15:11.180
so the train is not moving.

15:11.180 --> 15:14.990
So you are absolutely upset because you think
that the train has gone now what to do.

15:14.990 --> 15:20.450
In that upsetting you do not even remember
that you have a car and you have to go by

15:20.450 --> 15:22.019
the car.

15:22.019 --> 15:27.629
Now that whole things upsets you because you
had plans to go by train and you had planned

15:27.629 --> 15:30.820
everything, now you cannot reach there and
what will happen?

15:30.820 --> 15:33.800
Now you are sitting here and worrying about
it.

15:33.800 --> 15:37.720
As a person who is spontaneous what will you
do?

15:37.720 --> 15:42.120
All right depends on, I may go by train or
by car whatever I feel like at that time.

15:42.120 --> 15:43.920
He is sitting tight.

15:43.920 --> 15:47.899
So he goes to the train, sees if the train
is there.

15:47.899 --> 15:53.019
If it is, nicely there’s a space available
he gets into it.

15:53.019 --> 15:56.189
If the train is not available, all right,
he comes home takes his car and goes away.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.800
So now you have informed the people that you
must meet at such and such a place.

15:58.800 --> 16:02.220
That’s also is there you see.

16:02.220 --> 16:06.420
So those people are running up down there
and they will be there at the station.

16:06.420 --> 16:08.360
Now what’s the matter?

16:08.360 --> 16:10.860
Even if they’re at the station you can meet
them at the station.

16:10.860 --> 16:12.689
You go by train and you can meet them.

16:12.689 --> 16:16.259
What is there to be that much upset about
it?

16:16.259 --> 16:17.860
You see you can always contact them.

16:17.860 --> 16:23.730
But the way we get upset we have spoiled the
complete program of going to Birmingham, which

16:23.730 --> 16:27.240
is a very beautiful program that we have got.

16:27.240 --> 16:30.930
We have to meet new people, we have to meet
many people, we have to enjoy ourselves.

16:30.930 --> 16:38.470
That’s all finished because we had planned
something and it did not work out, we are

16:38.470 --> 16:39.470
finished.

16:39.470 --> 16:42.959
All these things make us a miserable person.

16:42.959 --> 16:48.220
And we are so miserable and so grudging and
so boring that those who are next to you just

16:48.220 --> 16:52.990
get fed up with it and they say, “Now shut
up.

16:52.990 --> 16:56.769
If you are not going to Birmingham, if you
are not going don’t go.

16:56.769 --> 17:01.120
But don’t eat my head now”, is a common
experience of many.

17:01.120 --> 17:06.630
If this Mr. Ego he’s so, he doesn’t want
you to be happy.

17:06.630 --> 17:10.670
He doesn’t want you to be relaxed.

17:10.670 --> 17:15.650
He all the time gives you ideas and tells
you, “Do this and do that and you must get

17:15.650 --> 17:16.890
it done and this is to be done.

17:16.890 --> 17:22.200
You had better inform that person, be meticulous
about it,” and it will go to such details

17:22.200 --> 17:27.340
that anything fails you are finished because
your nerves are already finished and shattered.

17:27.340 --> 17:34.750
Anything, even a drop of inconvenience comes
into you or even a feather of disturbance

17:34.750 --> 17:37.330
is there, you are finished.

17:37.330 --> 17:39.460
And so everybody is rattling, ”We have tensions.

17:39.460 --> 17:41.580
We have problems.”

17:41.580 --> 17:42.740
Why?

17:42.740 --> 17:50.630
What is the advantage of doing all these things?

17:50.630 --> 17:53.030
No advantage you know that.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.380
But then why do you do it?

17:54.380 --> 17:55.520
Because you have a big ego.

17:55.520 --> 17:57.600
It won’t allow you to rest.

17:57.600 --> 17:59.680
Whatever you may try it won’t.

17:59.680 --> 18:02.480
So what is the solution of that?

18:02.480 --> 18:05.390
Morning till evening ask for forgiveness from
God.

18:05.390 --> 18:10.090
Pull your ears from both the sides and say,
“Oh God, forgive me.

18:10.090 --> 18:11.850
Oh God, forgive me.

18:11.850 --> 18:18.040
And, oh God forgive me,” so this balloon
of ego goes down a little.

18:18.040 --> 18:20.690
Remember Him morning, evening, every time.

18:20.690 --> 18:25.290
Remembering Christ brings down your ego very
much.

18:25.290 --> 18:30.040
He did everything that was possible that you
should not develop your ego.

18:30.040 --> 18:32.030
Everything that was possible.

18:32.030 --> 18:36.350
He was born as an ordinary carpenter’s son.

18:36.350 --> 18:39.420
Lived in the most ordinary conditions.

18:39.420 --> 18:44.820
Kept Himself behind the whole scene.

18:44.820 --> 18:49.270
He could have been born as Roman Emperor.

18:49.270 --> 18:51.270
He could have been anybody there.

18:51.270 --> 18:54.050
But no He was born Himself.

18:54.050 --> 19:02.990
You know that He took his birth in a place
where even ordinary people do not take their

19:02.990 --> 19:03.990
births.

19:03.990 --> 19:05.840
But, there also the light was there.

19:05.840 --> 19:10.720
Wherever He was born there was light and joy.

19:10.720 --> 19:15.890
And this is the thing we have to know, that
we have lost the joy because we have forgotten

19:15.890 --> 19:17.570
God Almighty.

19:17.570 --> 19:27.040
When we forget Him, that He is love and He
is joy, naturally joy is also forgotten.

19:27.040 --> 19:30.400
And then we see people are not at all happy.

19:30.400 --> 19:35.460
They have affluence, they have money, they
have everything, but still they are not happy.

19:35.460 --> 19:41.090
All the time they are in such a mess that
you don’t know how to talk to them.

19:41.090 --> 19:43.080
If you say this word they’ll be angry.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.780
If you say that word they’ll be angry.

19:45.780 --> 19:49.780
They are not at all normal human beings.

19:49.780 --> 19:51.330
They are sick people.

19:51.330 --> 19:53.390
Sick with their ego.

19:53.390 --> 19:56.990
It’s a very simple thing is to ask for forgiveness.

19:56.990 --> 20:00.160
How many times do we do that?

20:00.160 --> 20:07.490
Not even once a day, not even once a month,
not even once a year.

20:07.490 --> 20:12.790
Even on a Christmas day if we could say, “Forgive
us Oh Lord for whatever we have done so far.”

20:12.790 --> 20:15.120
It will work out.

20:15.120 --> 20:19.700
But that day we must champagne to forgive
Him more.

20:19.700 --> 20:28.620
So we must have gossips and we must have all
the arrogant things by the time it is the

20:28.620 --> 20:31.020
end of Christmas.

20:31.020 --> 20:38.240
This ego, yellow side one, is the one that
presses your superego too much.

20:38.240 --> 20:39.280
It does.

20:39.280 --> 20:48.960
It presses it so much sometimes that a person
forgets that others are hurt by what they

20:48.960 --> 20:49.960
talk.

20:49.960 --> 20:56.470
On the contrary they devise methods how to
say things which are cutting, which are hurting,

20:56.470 --> 20:59.260
which are painful to others.

20:59.260 --> 21:03.210
They say such things, I mean all the time
if you see.

21:03.210 --> 21:07.470
A person say from a village if he comes and
sees he’ll think, are they quarreling, what

21:07.470 --> 21:08.470
are they doing?

21:08.470 --> 21:14.270
I mean the whole discussion, even in the parliament
I was surprised the way they talked to each

21:14.270 --> 21:20.750
other, no bull will treat another bull that
way, see.

21:20.750 --> 21:24.600
Even a dog normally does not bark at another
dog.

21:24.600 --> 21:30.350
No animal in the world all the time is barking
at its fellow man.

21:30.350 --> 21:34.180
No animal in the whole world I can tell you
this much.

21:34.180 --> 21:37.330
Only the human beings if two people are there
all the time they are going, ha ha ha ha all

21:37.330 --> 21:39.340
the time that way.

21:39.340 --> 21:40.580
How is it possible?

21:40.580 --> 21:47.670
His ego and her ego or maybe both his ego
are dashing at each other.

21:47.670 --> 21:55.650
There is a kind of a funny type of feeling
that oh I have mastered the thing, I have

21:55.650 --> 21:59.420
got the thing, I have got the point.

21:59.420 --> 22:00.760
I have proved the point.

22:00.760 --> 22:08.200
But in that I have lost everything that was
so beautiful and so much joy giving within

22:08.200 --> 22:09.200
me.

22:09.200 --> 22:15.880
Actually a sensible person would recede from
the place where two people are having an argument.

22:15.880 --> 22:21.210
Argument is a sign of tomfoolery.

22:21.210 --> 22:23.850
I haven’t seen any argument coming to any
end whatsoever.

22:23.850 --> 22:26.800
If it is then it is all right.

22:26.800 --> 22:29.030
But it never does come.

22:29.030 --> 22:33.460
Because, if say, you ask Me questions I answer
you, all right.

22:33.460 --> 22:36.920
If you do not like the answer give it up.

22:36.920 --> 22:42.160
But if you argue with Me still and I argue
with you where will you end?

22:42.160 --> 22:50.990
Argument is not going to lead you to any knowledge
but a very terrible ego developing into you.

22:50.990 --> 22:55.520
The whole modern concept is ego oriented.

22:55.520 --> 22:59.530
All western countries are ego orientated.

22:59.530 --> 23:02.420
They want to develop your ego and pamper it.

23:02.420 --> 23:05.400
There are so many other ways by which they
do.

23:05.400 --> 23:09.200
Why I’m talking more about it because we
are all supposed to be western people and

23:09.200 --> 23:10.510
affluent people you see.

23:10.510 --> 23:15.620
Supposed to be very wise and leading or misleading,
I don’t know, the developing countries.

23:15.620 --> 23:21.200
So we have to understand ourselves where are
we as far as our understanding of things are

23:21.200 --> 23:22.200
concerned.

23:22.200 --> 23:26.710
How ego is pampered within us is by a large-scale
method.

23:26.710 --> 23:32.130
They work on your ego throughout to have all
these so-called enterprises.

23:32.130 --> 23:37.770
For example to a woman they’ll say, “Oh
you must have a waist like this and you must

23:37.770 --> 23:42.670
have a face like this and you must have –“ For
a man, “You must this kind of a body.

23:42.670 --> 23:47.440
You should be Mr. Universe or you should be
something,” so the man starts working on

23:47.440 --> 23:48.440
it immediately.

23:48.440 --> 23:52.240
You must, there so many people I have seen
running on the roads in this cold, I don’t

23:52.240 --> 23:53.240
understand.

23:53.240 --> 23:55.220
Like mad you know and some of them are Member
of Parliament.

23:55.220 --> 23:58.840
The whole night they keep awake and the whole
day they are running about.

23:58.840 --> 24:00.760
I say what are you doing?

24:00.760 --> 24:01.940
What is the need to do this?

24:01.940 --> 24:04.090
To keep good health you must do it.

24:04.090 --> 24:10.420
To keep good health don’t work like mad,
be a sensible and a wise person.

24:10.420 --> 24:17.650
Wisdom is to be sought to keep good health,
to be all right and not this kind of mad ego

24:17.650 --> 24:19.120
orientated things.

24:19.120 --> 24:24.020
So then the one way is to excite your ego
about your physique.

24:24.020 --> 24:27.410
Then there is ego about, you must have a big
car.

24:27.410 --> 24:31.140
You see people try to show off their possessions.

24:31.140 --> 24:33.000
You have a big car, then they’re going about.

24:33.000 --> 24:37.030
I mean they really look to me like jokers,
that’s all they are.

24:37.030 --> 24:41.770
I mean car I can understand is a convenience
and a good quality car if somebody can afford

24:41.770 --> 24:44.410
it should have it because it is a headache
to have a bad car.

24:44.410 --> 24:45.890
So it’s all right.

24:45.890 --> 24:49.160
But by having a car you become something great.

24:49.160 --> 24:54.280
You may not have food in the house but you
must have a very good car to go about.

24:54.280 --> 24:55.400
And all these ideas come.

24:55.400 --> 24:58.500
Then they will advertise, you see, this will
be a very good car for you.

24:58.500 --> 24:59.500
What is it for you?

24:59.500 --> 25:02.250
It is nothing but to pamper your ego.

25:02.250 --> 25:07.100
All these advertisements are nothing but by
which your ego is pampered.

25:07.100 --> 25:08.940
All these things they’re treated.

25:08.940 --> 25:11.640
Now in America if you go every handle has
to be different.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.210
Everything has to be different.

25:13.210 --> 25:15.360
Why so much difference in everything?

25:15.360 --> 25:17.710
Why do you want to have everything so different?

25:17.710 --> 25:21.140
Is it some aesthetics, you think in that?

25:21.140 --> 25:26.340
It is none of the aesthetics but is just to
pamper your ego.

25:26.340 --> 25:31.100
Even the so-called art connoisseurs are nothing
but ego pamperers.

25:31.100 --> 25:35.890
Your stamp collections this, that, all this
is nothing but ego pampering.

25:35.890 --> 25:40.000
And what a waste of time, you just think about
it.

25:40.000 --> 25:48.860
This ego thing comes into us because we are
first of all, as I said, that in the west

25:48.860 --> 25:50.530
the living was very difficult.

25:50.530 --> 25:52.210
They had to fight the nature.

25:52.210 --> 25:56.380
And when you have to fight the nature you
have to develop your ego to fight it.

25:56.380 --> 26:00.300
Or actually when you are fighting the nature
the ego develops within you.

26:00.300 --> 26:06.890
And then once that momentum has started in
you it is very difficult to bring it down.

26:06.890 --> 26:13.670
It is such a terrible disease that people
have taken it for granted that that’s a

26:13.670 --> 26:14.780
part of their lives.

26:14.780 --> 26:16.000
You are not your ego.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.320
You are not.

26:18.320 --> 26:24.200
When I say that you must surrender yourself
to God they think Mother why should we surrender?

26:24.200 --> 26:27.070
Yourself means that ego with which you are
identified.

26:27.070 --> 26:31.310
I don’t say that you surrender your wisdom.

26:31.310 --> 26:37.380
Or I can say surrender your ego to your wisdom.

26:37.380 --> 26:41.800
But it is so difficult to give it up because
we have learned to live with it, identified

26:41.800 --> 26:42.800
with it.

26:42.800 --> 26:46.940
We just cannot think of life without our ego,
we just cannot.

26:46.940 --> 26:54.670
And it has gone to such an extent that we
don’t even realize how far we have gone

26:54.670 --> 26:55.730
in cruelty.

26:55.730 --> 26:59.390
Like, “I like this kind, I like that kind.”

26:59.390 --> 27:02.870
You go to somebody’s house and you say like
this.

27:02.870 --> 27:06.650
Is indecent to talk like that.

27:06.650 --> 27:09.250
It is vulgar to express, “I like.”

27:09.250 --> 27:10.250
Who are you?

27:10.250 --> 27:11.250
Are you God?

27:11.250 --> 27:14.480
I want this.

27:14.480 --> 27:15.480
I want that.

27:15.480 --> 27:17.080
I am very particular about this.

27:17.080 --> 27:19.600
I’m very, who are you?

27:19.600 --> 27:26.560
Just ask yourself a question, “Who am I?

27:26.560 --> 27:28.940
I’m the Spirit.

27:28.940 --> 27:31.390
I’m that eternal being.

27:31.390 --> 27:35.740
Have I become that?”

27:35.740 --> 27:40.350
On the contrary we are hurting everybody’s
Spirit by our ego.

27:40.350 --> 27:45.760
Every moment when we talk to others we are
hurting them.

27:45.760 --> 27:52.770
Actually people have lost faith in God, because
those who are in charge of God are so arrogant

27:52.770 --> 28:01.810
and so egoistical that it has become impossible
for anybody to think of God, which is beyond

28:01.810 --> 28:03.020
your ego.

28:03.020 --> 28:07.780
You’ll be surprised, ego is absolutely superficial
like a bubble.

28:07.780 --> 28:13.250
It is just like a balloon, which can burst
just like that.

28:13.250 --> 28:14.370
And it should go.

28:14.370 --> 28:18.370
It should go so that you should rise.

28:18.370 --> 28:24.380
It should disappear so that your attention
rises in your Spirit.

28:24.380 --> 28:31.410
And that you see the whole world as a part
of that Spirit that you are.

28:31.410 --> 28:37.100
This is the boundary, which you have to cross
and for that we have to take help from Christ.

28:37.100 --> 28:40.190
Christ crucified himself.

28:40.190 --> 28:41.730
Why?

28:41.730 --> 28:44.290
Because what did He do?

28:44.290 --> 28:45.650
Did He loot people?

28:45.650 --> 28:52.160
Today you have thousands of these thugs coming
here and looting you.

28:52.160 --> 28:54.330
Nobody crucifies them.

28:54.330 --> 28:56.510
What did He do?

28:56.510 --> 29:04.880
He just challenged the ego of these Romans
and of these Jews, those who were angry with

29:04.880 --> 29:11.340
Him, and that’s why He was crucified.

29:11.340 --> 29:15.030
And we have to crucify our ego now through
His cross.

29:15.030 --> 29:25.940
Otherwise we are going to do the same again
to ourselves that in our own being we crucify

29:25.940 --> 29:28.000
our Christ by our ego.

29:28.000 --> 29:36.980
It is a very symbolic gesture of Christ, His
birth in the most humble place, in a very

29:36.980 --> 29:37.980
humble place.

29:37.980 --> 29:43.750
He is born in the optic thalamus, you can
say, is the place where there brain, all activities

29:43.750 --> 29:52.280
coming and all the, all sorts of problems
there chasing you, and there He lives and

29:52.280 --> 30:01.020
you have to just awaken Him there so that
your ego is crucified once for all.

30:01.020 --> 30:05.630
But I don’t think you fight your ego because
it is not that important to fight.

30:05.630 --> 30:08.030
You are fighting with your shadow.

30:08.030 --> 30:14.630
You have shadow which is called as ego which
is not to be fought and wasted, waste your

30:14.630 --> 30:15.630
energy on him.

30:15.630 --> 30:21.030
Just no need to fight, only thing if you stand
in the center of the light you don’t see

30:21.030 --> 30:22.030
any shadow.

30:22.030 --> 30:23.320
It is so simple as that.

30:23.320 --> 30:29.190
If you stand in the center of light that is
Christ you don’t see any shadow anywhere.

30:29.190 --> 30:33.670
But when I say this I may sound like other
people who give sermons, “Stand in the shadow

30:33.670 --> 30:36.440
of Christ or stand in the light of Christ.”

30:36.440 --> 30:38.500
Now what does that mean?

30:38.500 --> 30:43.730
Where is that light or where is that place
where you should stand?

30:43.730 --> 30:54.510
That place is here – the center of your
optic thalamus where there is no thought.

30:54.510 --> 30:58.110
You have to stand in thoughtless awareness.

30:58.110 --> 31:03.580
Many people who have had a problem with Agnya,
many people who have come

31:03.580 --> 31:07.840
[Talk is interrupted here and a few words
are missing]

31:07.840 --> 31:10.250
…thoughts will stop and they will be beyond
thought.

31:10.250 --> 31:14.940
And this a very, very important Chakra for
Sahaja Yogis because when the Kundalini rises

31:14.940 --> 31:19.700
above, above the Agnya Chakra immediately
there is no thought.

31:19.700 --> 31:24.970
You do not get any thoughts from ego or superego.

31:24.970 --> 31:30.910
But there is wobbling in the Agnya because
of your imbalanced ways.

31:30.910 --> 31:36.830
And the imbalanced ways are, that sometimes
you are with ego or with superego.

31:36.830 --> 31:42.200
This has happened to our people in the West
because we have had so much of ego we got

31:42.200 --> 31:43.880
really tired of it.

31:43.880 --> 31:45.970
We got frightened with it.

31:45.970 --> 31:50.450
Then we started taking to drugs and things
to increase our superego.

31:50.450 --> 31:56.020
But by doing that what we are doing is pushing
by one end and bringing back another end and

31:56.020 --> 32:03.830
that’s how we are wobbling our ego and superego
by which we are not helping ourselves at all.

32:03.830 --> 32:09.310
So what one has to do is to rise within oneself
up to the point of Agnya and try to steady

32:09.310 --> 32:10.310
your Agnya.

32:10.310 --> 32:13.540
There are many people have asked Me one question.

32:13.540 --> 32:16.260
How to steady the Agnya?

32:16.260 --> 32:25.130
Agnya is placed at the crossing point of our
nerves and also optic thalamus.

32:25.130 --> 32:31.520
Now, so it is said that if you have wobbling
eyes you’ll have a wobbling Agnya.

32:31.520 --> 32:33.740
You have to steady your eyes.

32:33.740 --> 32:35.210
You have to soothe them.

32:35.210 --> 32:43.210
Now it is very, very out of date, ancient,
old and all sorts of names that you call it

32:43.210 --> 32:44.560
to a thing like that.

32:44.560 --> 32:50.190
But you must steady your eyes and steady them
in such a way that it is very soothing for

32:50.190 --> 32:51.190
the eyes.

32:51.190 --> 32:56.140
Which is the most soothing thing for the eyes
is the green grass.

32:56.140 --> 33:03.940
If you could see the green grass with your
eyes means you walk with your eyes on the

33:03.940 --> 33:04.940
ground.

33:04.940 --> 33:08.760
Your eyes will be soothed, your Agnya will
be all right.

33:08.760 --> 33:13.980
That’s why Christ said that, “I tell you
about the adulterous eyes”.

33:13.980 --> 33:15.530
He talked about adulterous eyes.

33:15.530 --> 33:19.050
The eyes with which you do adultery.

33:19.050 --> 33:22.310
Is a very common thing these days.

33:22.310 --> 33:24.299
Every woman a man must see.

33:24.299 --> 33:25.900
Every man a woman must see.

33:25.900 --> 33:28.340
As if it is the most important job.

33:28.340 --> 33:31.840
If you have not seen one woman you’re finished.

33:31.840 --> 33:33.730
I mean this is being modern.

33:33.730 --> 33:36.380
But I am an old fashioned lady.

33:36.380 --> 33:41.070
And at the time of Christ he said, “You
should not have adulterous eyes.”

33:41.070 --> 33:50.440
And the ones who have adulterous eyes are,
no more than any other, but our Western Christians.

33:50.440 --> 33:56.090
Who all the time even in the church, even
when they’re giving sermons, their eyes

33:56.090 --> 33:58.970
are moving with adultery.

33:58.970 --> 34:06.450
These eyes have to be very, very pure, very,
very deep and very loving when you want to

34:06.450 --> 34:09.040
have your Agnya all right.

34:09.040 --> 34:11.829
Because you receive through you eyes.

34:11.829 --> 34:15.240
Say if you have closed your eyes you do not
put your attention to anything because your

34:15.240 --> 34:16.240
eyes are closed.

34:16.240 --> 34:19.149
You are not adding more thoughts to yourself.

34:19.149 --> 34:23.500
But if your eyes are open you are adding much
more thoughts because everywhere the eyes

34:23.500 --> 34:28.679
go the attention goes and you see things and
create thoughts and put in them.

34:28.679 --> 34:36.019
So your attention which has to go to the Spirit,
which has to go to God, which has to shine

34:36.019 --> 34:38.200
through the window of Divine.

34:38.200 --> 34:48.059
This beautiful thing is ruined by the way
we use our eyes and we do not respect it.

34:48.059 --> 34:56.220
There’s nothing so pure and beautiful as
the grass on the ground or the ground itself,

34:56.220 --> 35:03.059
which takes our feet, which supports us, which
looks after us, enriches us.

35:03.059 --> 35:07.819
We should put our eyes on the Mother Earth
instead of looking at every person.

35:07.819 --> 35:12.941
But from Sahaja Yoga point of view now many
of you know what happens to your eyes when

35:12.941 --> 35:14.730
you look at somebody.

35:14.730 --> 35:18.369
Maybe a entity might enter your eyes.

35:18.369 --> 35:24.750
And it is, you’ll be amazed that it is the
play of the entity what we call this so-called

35:24.750 --> 35:25.750
flirting is.

35:25.750 --> 35:30.420
I’ve talked about it before also and people
didn’t like it when I told them about it.

35:30.420 --> 35:36.329
But I have seen actual entities entering from
eyes to eyes.

35:36.329 --> 35:42.109
I have seen very simple people who come down
to such places, say in a party.

35:42.109 --> 35:46.420
In a party people are just exchanging entities
from one eye to another.

35:46.420 --> 35:51.050
Once it goes to another person he puts his
entity into another person.

35:51.050 --> 35:52.050
And that third goes into another person.

35:52.050 --> 35:55.900
All the time your attention is diverted.

35:55.900 --> 36:02.260
And you feel it is attracted towards something,
you do not know why it is attracted.

36:02.260 --> 36:03.670
Now the certain symbols are also made like
that.

36:03.670 --> 36:08.599
To add up to the problems, you see all the
society is working at it.

36:08.599 --> 36:13.140
That you should appear in such a way that
every man should look at you.

36:13.140 --> 36:16.500
Every woman should look at you.

36:16.500 --> 36:17.500
Why?

36:17.500 --> 36:19.300
What is the use?

36:19.300 --> 36:23.459
Supposing I look at you what do I get?

36:23.459 --> 36:25.010
What do I get by looking at a person?

36:25.010 --> 36:29.140
What is the advantage just looking at a person?

36:29.140 --> 36:33.359
We are wasting such a lot of energy for what?

36:33.359 --> 36:41.049
In the same way if you are walking on the
roads, we are seeing some beautiful things

36:41.049 --> 36:42.049
all right.

36:42.049 --> 36:45.359
If you have to buy something, all right go
ahead, see those things, whatever you have

36:45.359 --> 36:46.700
to select is all right.

36:46.700 --> 36:51.980
But all the time just because your eyes are
such, you are just doing it and you do not

36:51.980 --> 36:59.230
know the reason why you are doing like this,
all the time why your eyes are wobbling.

36:59.230 --> 37:03.369
And that is a sure and certain sign for a
person to become mad.

37:03.369 --> 37:12.140
Absolutely, that’s a sure and certain sign
is, when a person is mad how do you make it

37:12.140 --> 37:13.750
out that a person is lunatic.

37:13.750 --> 37:20.039
If you see his eyes the iris in the eyes are
all the time wobbling.

37:20.039 --> 37:21.880
They cannot keep it steady.

37:21.880 --> 37:28.170
Or they are sick they’re also, you can see,
that these eyes are all the time wobbling.

37:28.170 --> 37:30.200
There is no steadiness.

37:30.200 --> 37:34.380
Not only this but you have seen those people
who have come in the Sahaja Yoga when they

37:34.380 --> 37:37.630
close their eyes they find their eyes are
flickering.

37:37.630 --> 37:40.880
Their eyelids are flickering.

37:40.880 --> 37:48.269
That means there is some sort of a disturbance
in the Kundalini rising.

37:48.269 --> 37:57.030
Whole tension if you call it as hundred then
at least eighty percent of it comes through

37:57.030 --> 37:58.140
our eyes.

37:58.140 --> 38:06.710
Then how important it is to protect our eyes
from all kind of useless activities we are

38:06.710 --> 38:07.720
doing.

38:07.720 --> 38:17.200
Christ - Christ’s life shows so many aspects
of how to respect others.

38:17.200 --> 38:23.510
But one of them which has been very much misused
throughout is that of the prostitute.

38:23.510 --> 38:30.549
He saved the prostitute, He saved her no doubt.

38:30.549 --> 38:34.069
But you spoil these prostitutes.

38:34.069 --> 38:38.640
A good woman you make her into prostitutes.

38:38.640 --> 38:42.190
You give her ideas by which she becomes a
prostitute.

38:42.190 --> 38:49.130
A good Huswife (old English word like housewife)
is turned into a prostitute by an egotistical

38:49.130 --> 38:50.130
man.

38:50.130 --> 38:56.180
Young small girls who are virgins are being
destroyed by your dirty glances.

38:56.180 --> 38:58.730
Do you realize this?

38:58.730 --> 39:01.880
That you are doing just the opposite what
Christ had done?

39:01.880 --> 39:06.680
And you say that He saved, Christ, so even
if we are prostitutes He’ll save us.

39:06.680 --> 39:08.630
But why be prostitutes?

39:08.630 --> 39:13.569
This is such a stupid style of thinking.

39:13.569 --> 39:19.970
That we should become prostitutes so that
Christ will save us.

39:19.970 --> 39:28.810
One has to think about all these things in
the proper light of Sahaja Yoga.

39:28.810 --> 39:33.660
Unless and until you are realized My talk
is just useless for you.

39:33.660 --> 39:39.869
But once you are realized you will know that
if you glance at someone you might suddenly

39:39.869 --> 39:41.450
get a headache at the back.

39:41.450 --> 39:45.970
You might feel a dart has gone into your head
or something has happened.

39:45.970 --> 39:52.300
You might feel that you’re blinding with
somebody’s face and you will get all kinds

39:52.300 --> 39:57.660
of experiences by which you will know how
important are your eyes.

39:57.660 --> 40:03.809
All your nervousness and everything can be
cured if you have pure eyes.

40:03.809 --> 40:08.619
But it is such a vicious circle that through
your eyes you gather all the bad and is accumulated

40:08.619 --> 40:13.930
in the Agnya and you have to clear the Agnya
to make the eyes clear.

40:13.930 --> 40:14.950
It’s a vicious circle.

40:14.950 --> 40:19.740
But it can start at a point as I said, we
have to ask for forgiveness.

40:19.740 --> 40:28.160
Secondly we have to bring Christ in our Agnya
Chakra.

40:28.160 --> 40:36.579
Thirdly we have to give up all drugs and all
intoxicants and all smoking.

40:36.579 --> 40:41.470
That happens automatically when you are a
Sahaja Yogi, it will work out.

40:41.470 --> 40:51.089
But eyes express the whole of your being,
your brain, your body, your limbs everything.

40:51.089 --> 40:58.630
And if your Agnya is all right then you eyes
are perfectly all right.

40:58.630 --> 41:01.849
They emit nothing but love wherever they glance.

41:01.849 --> 41:08.150
Only with a glance of your eyes you can raise
the Kundalini.

41:08.150 --> 41:12.119
Only with the glance of your eyes you can
cure people.

41:12.119 --> 41:19.800
Only with your glance you can bring joy into
the destroyed and the ruined people.

41:19.800 --> 41:24.359
So these eyes which you see are the windows
of your being, of your heart.

41:24.359 --> 41:32.220
When the Spirit is expressed through your
eyes, you must have noticed yourself, that

41:32.220 --> 41:36.829
when the Kundalini rises then the eyes become
dilated.

41:36.829 --> 41:46.920
And a realized soul has got black eyes because
they have these eyes are dilated.

41:46.920 --> 41:50.950
At least when I see them they are all dilated
black eyes.

41:50.950 --> 41:56.190
Apart from that a realized soul can be made
out by his eyes which are sparkling.

41:56.190 --> 41:58.160
There’s a sparkle like diamonds.

41:58.160 --> 42:03.800
They sparkle all the time and you can make
out from the eyes that this person is a realized

42:03.800 --> 42:04.800
soul.

42:04.800 --> 42:09.569
There’s a tremendous difference between
a non-realized soul’s eyes and a realized

42:09.569 --> 42:10.569
soul’s eyes.

42:10.569 --> 42:15.240
So you can imagine how your Spirit sees through
your eyes.

42:15.240 --> 42:20.369
But if the eyes are not pure it doesn’t
stay there long.

42:20.369 --> 42:25.420
So if we have to understand Christ physically
we have to respect our eyes.

42:25.420 --> 42:32.119
Mentally we have to give up all that is impure
in our mind.

42:32.119 --> 42:36.380
Now, so we come to the impurities of the mind.

42:36.380 --> 42:42.650
And the impurities of mind are, there are
so many poisons, you know, about.

42:42.650 --> 42:45.390
I mean there are books and books written about
the poison.

42:45.390 --> 42:47.339
And the psychologists are supposed to take
out all your poisons.

42:47.339 --> 42:50.790
I don’t know if they can do it at all.

42:50.790 --> 42:52.430
But they have the worst Agnya.

42:52.430 --> 42:58.730
All these psychologists have the worst Agnya
and I don’t think they are capable of really

42:58.730 --> 43:00.700
giving any relief to people who suffering
mentally.

43:00.700 --> 43:01.700
Mental sufferings are of two types.

43:01.700 --> 43:07.220
Say the same thing is that one is…

43:07.220 --> 43:17.859
MOTHER SAYS ASIDE: Vibrations are so much,
I can’t stand it.

43:17.859 --> 43:25.849
One type of mental troubles are where people
oppress you very much.

43:25.849 --> 43:30.499
You see you go on bearing the cross.

43:30.499 --> 43:35.980
Now this is a very wrong idea people have
about Christ.

43:35.980 --> 43:42.359
Bearing the cross doesn’t mean that anybody
who tries to oppress you should go on taking

43:42.359 --> 43:45.170
the enslavement upon yourself.

43:45.170 --> 43:51.630
You’re not to enslave to anyone whatsoever.

43:51.630 --> 43:57.309
Anybody who tries to make a slave out of you,
you should deny it absolutely.

43:57.309 --> 43:59.180
You should say Hum, I am.

43:59.180 --> 44:01.619
Who are you to dominate me?

44:01.619 --> 44:08.869
Anyone whether you are of a black skin, or
a red skin or a yellow skin, nobody has right

44:08.869 --> 44:11.490
to dominate anyone in this whole world.

44:11.490 --> 44:17.460
And if anybody is doing it, “Oh what to
do now, after all you see we are poor people,

44:17.460 --> 44:20.940
or we are like this or he’s supporting,”
and all that.

44:20.940 --> 44:25.480
Then they are running away from their duty
towards themselves.

44:25.480 --> 44:29.200
Such people cannot get Realization.

44:29.200 --> 44:32.710
Slaves are not going to become kings.

44:32.710 --> 44:42.700
So the slavery that is supposed to be confused
with bearing the cross is another confusion

44:42.700 --> 44:46.799
of modern times.

44:46.799 --> 44:49.440
We have to rise in our self-respect.

44:49.440 --> 44:56.490
And we have to understand that no one in this
world has a right to dominate us.

44:56.490 --> 44:59.960
But then what is bearing of the cross is?

44:59.960 --> 45:04.460
First of all the people of His level never
suffer.

45:04.460 --> 45:07.559
It’s just a joke going on.

45:07.559 --> 45:12.730
It’s a Leela, it’s a play going on for
them.

45:12.730 --> 45:21.529
They never suffer, and even if they so called
act as suffering they just do it because they

45:21.529 --> 45:23.290
want to do it.

45:23.290 --> 45:25.970
They are not helpless people.

45:25.970 --> 45:30.029
They are not slaves.

45:30.029 --> 45:36.800
And those who think that by bearing it up
and by suffering it we are becoming Christians

45:36.800 --> 45:42.559
they should know they are psychological cases.

45:42.559 --> 45:46.880
And if they are crying and weeping and all
the time saying, “What to do, you see I

45:46.880 --> 45:50.839
am in love and my lover tortures me.”

45:50.839 --> 45:54.510
You are neither in love neither you have a
lover.

45:54.510 --> 45:57.359
It is a kind of a psychological clubbing.

45:57.359 --> 46:01.720
That he is a dominating man and you like his
domination, that’s why you are together.

46:01.720 --> 46:06.310
Is a simple fact.

46:06.310 --> 46:09.290
So every human being has his own self-respect.

46:09.290 --> 46:12.380
And he must respect his self that is the Spirit
within him.

46:12.380 --> 46:15.049
And nothing should dominate it.

46:15.049 --> 46:16.609
Whether you belong to this country or that
country, or this ism or that ism.

46:16.609 --> 46:17.609
All this will break down.

46:17.609 --> 46:18.609
[The red part is not present in the tape with
FV.

46:18.609 --> 46:22.760
Also in the FV’s tape the following sentence
is a single sentence, spoken unbroken by Shri

46:22.760 --> 46:23.760
Mataji]

46:23.760 --> 46:27.730
Under the rule of God nobody has the right
to dominate anybody’s Spirit.

46:27.730 --> 46:37.150
But when you are given freedom you go to the
other side that is Mr. Ego.

46:37.150 --> 46:38.150
You do not know how to use your freedom.

46:38.150 --> 46:41.220
So you try to dominate others.

46:41.220 --> 46:46.980
Your freedom is, everybody’s freedom is
in danger.

46:46.980 --> 46:51.319
You’re on top of everyone, and torturing
everybody’s souls.

46:51.319 --> 46:59.270
And you are dominating by land and by properties
or by possessions.

46:59.270 --> 47:12.760
So either this way or that way, mentally if
you are of this category or that category,

47:12.760 --> 47:14.259
you are against yourself.

47:14.259 --> 47:19.890
Just be in the center and see for yourself.

47:19.890 --> 47:22.079
Just be looking at it.

47:22.079 --> 47:27.489
Are you emitting love towards another person?

47:27.489 --> 47:35.640
If you are a slave how can you love?

47:35.640 --> 47:36.640
You cannot.

47:36.640 --> 47:45.720
If you are free and abandoned how can you
love?

47:45.720 --> 47:50.700
Love has its own bondages very sweet and beautiful.

47:50.700 --> 47:54.220
You have to live with them.

47:54.220 --> 47:55.559
You enjoy those bondages.

47:55.559 --> 48:00.690
For a little child will come to your house
and he will spoil your house no doubt, and

48:00.690 --> 48:01.759
that he should do.

48:01.759 --> 48:05.910
And you should enjoy that spoiling.

48:05.910 --> 48:12.960
Then your freedom if it is challenged by a
little child’s crying, then you are not

48:12.960 --> 48:13.960
wise people.

48:13.960 --> 48:15.430
This is abandonment.

48:15.430 --> 48:19.839
Or I would say it is loneliness.

48:19.839 --> 48:31.410
It is cutting off from the primordial, from
the big one, from the large one that you are.

48:31.410 --> 48:35.849
Is not to be able to tolerate the freedom
of others.

48:35.849 --> 48:40.550
A child has no freedom to cry in the house.

48:40.550 --> 48:43.660
What sort of freedom you conceive of.

48:43.660 --> 48:49.579
A mother has no right to say something she
wants to say about her child, which is her

48:49.579 --> 48:52.130
duty to tell him what is right and wrong.

48:52.130 --> 48:58.340
If the son does not have right to eat whatever
he likes in his own mother’s family then

48:58.340 --> 49:00.450
what sort of freedom do you have?

49:00.450 --> 49:04.499
It’s such a confusion of things.

49:04.499 --> 49:09.210
So this kind of freedom is just the opposite
and extreme of enslavement.

49:09.210 --> 49:13.300
But in the center is love where you are bound
by everyone.

49:13.300 --> 49:17.009
I am bound by My children.

49:17.009 --> 49:18.579
Yes, I am.

49:18.579 --> 49:20.300
I am proud of them.

49:20.300 --> 49:24.150
They bound Me and I bound them too.

49:24.150 --> 49:27.079
It’s a mutual bounding which we enjoy among
ourselves.

49:27.079 --> 49:35.130
There is such a give and take when there is
such a bondage of love.

49:35.130 --> 49:41.809
But do we understand the importance of bondage
of love?

49:41.809 --> 49:44.190
At the slightest pretext we break it.

49:44.190 --> 49:47.309
Say wife says, “I would like to go out today”.

49:47.309 --> 49:48.470
The husband says “Why?

49:48.470 --> 49:51.890
I am very tired don’t you understand?“

49:51.890 --> 49:56.539
Or if the husband says, “I feel like eating
something,” or some particular thing he

49:56.539 --> 49:58.109
says pancake or something, a small thing.

49:58.109 --> 50:00.900
“Oh I am very tired every time you are demanding.”

50:00.900 --> 50:06.530
If she could just think by making that little
thing he would be so very happy.

50:06.530 --> 50:09.170
She should be dying to know what he wants.

50:09.170 --> 50:11.339
And he should be dying to do what she wants.

50:11.339 --> 50:16.450
And then enjoy each other’s company or you
are wasting all your properties that you have

50:16.450 --> 50:17.450
as human beings.

50:17.450 --> 50:21.849
You don’t know how much you are wasting
from each other.

50:21.849 --> 50:29.230
Every moment is filled with such beautiful
bondages, where exchanges are there.

50:29.230 --> 50:31.690
What have you gained?

50:31.690 --> 50:34.180
The way you are fighting.

50:34.180 --> 50:36.489
The way you are going about.

50:36.489 --> 50:39.759
What have you gained let me see?

50:39.759 --> 50:44.910
When you die you have to announce in the paper
that XYZ is dead and you find there is nobody.

50:44.910 --> 50:48.589
And you have even to pay for people to visit
you when you die.

50:48.589 --> 50:52.099
This is the case today.

50:52.099 --> 50:56.730
Such dryness, such emptiness, such loneliness
exists.

50:56.730 --> 51:01.269
What have you achieved through this.

51:01.269 --> 51:04.720
So this bondage we have to.

51:04.720 --> 51:06.911
And there is no question of sacrifice you
see, the way.

51:06.911 --> 51:07.911
We must sacrifice for the family.

51:07.911 --> 51:08.911
What are you sacrificing?

51:08.911 --> 51:16.430
I mean if you pay for your family you get
the joy out of it.

51:16.430 --> 51:20.119
That’s why you do it.

51:20.119 --> 51:28.190
If you have to lead a nice good life you are
not sacrificing anything but you are gaining

51:28.190 --> 51:32.480
by that, leading a good life.

51:32.480 --> 51:38.339
If your wife says, “Don’t go to the pub,”
and if you do not go there, then you should

51:38.339 --> 51:42.599
not say she is an orthodox, old fashioned
this that, that and that and that.

51:42.599 --> 51:47.872
But instead you should thank you stars that
in this modern times also that there is somebody

51:47.872 --> 51:51.650
who’s telling you the truth.

51:51.650 --> 51:57.109
Because the whole edifice has come up, do
you mean to say that truth should not be told?

51:57.109 --> 52:01.930
All this is falsehood in which you are living.

52:01.930 --> 52:04.819
And if you have to be happy come down to reality.

52:04.819 --> 52:07.030
Friends, also same thing.

52:07.030 --> 52:14.339
With the friends what sort of relations do
we have with our friends?

52:14.339 --> 52:17.160
What do we expect from them?

52:17.160 --> 52:25.609
Sending them a Christmas card and then if
they don’t send, feeling bad about it.

52:25.609 --> 52:29.549
There are no deeper bondages we have not lived
with them.

52:29.549 --> 52:36.489
If you allow our self to be bound by them,
they will be bound by us.

52:36.489 --> 52:38.500
You better try this.

52:38.500 --> 52:39.920
Try to be bound by them.

52:39.920 --> 52:41.680
Don’t be afraid of anybody else.

52:41.680 --> 52:47.720
Just try to be bound by others and you’ll
be amazed how much they will be giving you.

52:47.720 --> 52:53.289
I am a living example of this.

52:53.289 --> 52:55.780
I can tell you I am a living example of this.

52:55.780 --> 52:58.700
I am bound by all of you.

52:58.700 --> 53:01.359
If somebody says, “Mother when are you going
to leave us?”

53:01.359 --> 53:02.359
No I cannot.

53:02.359 --> 53:03.359
I cannot.

53:03.359 --> 53:04.930
I am just bound by you.

53:04.930 --> 53:08.410
I just do not want to leave because I love
you very much.

53:08.410 --> 53:10.529
How can I leave you?

53:10.529 --> 53:13.660
It’s impossible for Me.

53:13.660 --> 53:16.960
So then, what do I gain out of this life?

53:16.960 --> 53:19.140
Everything that is in this world.

53:19.140 --> 53:21.630
What do you want Me to get?

53:21.630 --> 53:27.519
I cannot even count what I can get out of
it.

53:27.519 --> 53:30.440
Immeasurable, ocean.

53:30.440 --> 53:32.829
I become an ocean Myself.

53:32.829 --> 53:44.380
Break your ideas about your own personal freedom
and liberation, is liberating your intelligence.

53:44.380 --> 53:48.140
You‘re liberating your own wisdom.

53:48.140 --> 54:01.869
And the sweetness and the beauty which is
never perishable whether you are old or young.

54:01.869 --> 54:04.289
That is going to be your own.

54:04.289 --> 54:11.999
But these poisons that are being built outside
and inside you, please throw them away.

54:11.999 --> 54:15.019
These are mental poisons.

54:15.019 --> 54:20.309
Through Agnya you can take them out.

54:20.309 --> 54:26.109
You see, this is an opening also through which
many things go out.

54:26.109 --> 54:28.999
Try to work it out.

54:28.999 --> 54:37.499
Look at the tree with love and you’ll find
that the tree itself is giving you the joy

54:37.499 --> 54:39.160
of its creation.

54:39.160 --> 54:41.920
Because you’ll become thoughtless.

54:41.920 --> 54:47.849
And the creator who has made that beautiful
tree will be pouring all that joy which is

54:47.849 --> 54:49.869
stored into it into you.

54:49.869 --> 54:55.050
Every human being is a store of joy.

54:55.050 --> 54:59.599
Unlimited, I assure you, believe Me.

54:59.599 --> 55:06.710
And don’t waste them because somebody is
not properly dressed, or he’s not according

55:06.710 --> 55:12.049
to the way you want him to be which you learnt
in your public school.

55:12.049 --> 55:22.739
Every doorstep, everywhere there is beauty
lying, do not miss it.

55:22.739 --> 55:29.989
But if you have possessiveness about it, an
adultery about it, then you can never enjoy

55:29.989 --> 55:33.769
them.

55:33.769 --> 55:43.150
You can never enjoy all that beauty, all that
store, all that wealth that is in every human

55:43.150 --> 55:47.279
being every moment it is bubbling.

55:47.279 --> 55:52.420
For Agnya it’s a good thing, Christmas is
coming.

55:52.420 --> 55:59.930
And at the time that when I have to wish you
Happy Christmas, that at this occasion I am

55:59.930 --> 56:07.960
speaking about Agnya Chakra in which, what
I said is, Agnya is one must know what to

56:07.960 --> 56:10.630
order and how to obey.

56:10.630 --> 56:13.099
Obey the Divine.

56:13.099 --> 56:17.349
Obey your elders.

56:17.349 --> 56:23.150
Obey your self and not your ego.

56:23.150 --> 56:27.759
And then you can order also others.

56:27.759 --> 56:33.079
Not only human beings, but you can even order
the sun and the moon and all the winds and

56:33.079 --> 56:34.220
everything in the world.

56:34.220 --> 56:39.609
Everything you can control, everything with
this Agnya.

56:39.609 --> 56:42.309
You try one thing.

56:42.309 --> 56:47.769
If you know somebody is going to do something
wrong, just take his name and put it to Agnya.

56:47.769 --> 56:50.759
He’ll not do it, try it.

56:50.759 --> 56:57.280
This is a trick I’m telling about for those
who are realized souls not for those who are

56:57.280 --> 57:01.079
not yet realized but those who are realized
can try.

57:01.079 --> 57:04.540
If the other person is doing something wrong
you can try your Agnya.

57:04.540 --> 57:10.799
Anything you order on your Agnya will be respected
but your Agnya must have Christ there.

57:10.799 --> 57:19.109
Because you have the great support awakened
within you, which does not exist here but

57:19.109 --> 57:20.109
into every man’s head.

57:20.109 --> 57:30.470
It is all pervading into all small atoms and
molecules, it is everywhere into the sun and

57:30.470 --> 57:32.420
any place you go.

57:32.420 --> 57:36.140
It is there.

57:36.140 --> 57:43.640
So try to develop your Agnya that is the mastery
of your self.

57:43.640 --> 57:51.410
Those who have a good Agnya can master anything
and understand that the idea about mastering

57:51.410 --> 57:57.150
worldly things and mastering human beings
and mastering this and some of them are mastering

57:57.150 --> 58:03.680
in, say, other crafts and things, best thing
is to master your Agnya.

58:03.680 --> 58:11.200
And you really become the master of yourself
by which you can master many things.

58:11.200 --> 58:17.690
And today on this great day when I’m wishing
you a Happy Christmas, I wish you to have

58:17.690 --> 58:26.930
the most powerful Agnya, that people when
they see your forehead should know that Christ

58:26.930 --> 58:29.670
is reborn again with in you.
