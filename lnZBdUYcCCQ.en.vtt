00:16.960 --> 00:21.080
I have told them in Hindi language

00:21.240 --> 00:24.760
that love, you can see one person's love

00:24.920 --> 00:28.520
manifested in so many eyes here.

00:28.680 --> 00:31.320
And when I saw the enthusiasm

00:31.480 --> 00:37.880
also My heart got filled with great love, greater love.

00:40.200 --> 00:45.760
So one can see how powerful is this love.

00:45.960 --> 00:50.920
All kinds of bad feelings,

00:51.080 --> 00:53.560
negative thinking

00:53.720 --> 00:58.680
and also self-destructive elements

00:58.840 --> 01:01.880
can be corrected and controlled

01:02.040 --> 01:04.480
very simply in Sahaja Yoga,

01:04.640 --> 01:09.080
if you with sincere heart meditate

01:09.240 --> 01:12.280
morning and evening, twice.

01:12.440 --> 01:15.800
That time you shouldn't see your watches, of course,

01:15.960 --> 01:20.680
but enjoy, enjoy your meditation.

01:21.080 --> 01:24.760
That will give you such a strength to love others,

01:24.920 --> 01:27.280
to forgive others;

01:27.440 --> 01:31.880
instead of you feeling bad for small, small things,

01:32.040 --> 01:36.520
you feeling irritated

01:36.680 --> 01:42.680
because you think your self-respect is challenged,

01:42.840 --> 01:52.160
or else sometimes we become aggressive towards some people,

01:52.320 --> 01:54.680
very aggressive,

01:54.840 --> 01:58.120
for no fault of theirs.

01:58.720 --> 02:04.480
Best thing is to see the vibrations of another person.

02:04.640 --> 02:10.240
If the vibrations are bad, no use fighting,

02:10.400 --> 02:14.720
it will create more confusions.

02:15.920 --> 02:19.080
A person who has very bad vibrations,

02:19.240 --> 02:21.720
you can't fight with that person,

02:21.880 --> 02:25.360
you cannot control that person.

02:25.520 --> 02:31.040
Or a person who is too much of self-importance,

02:31.200 --> 02:36.640
you should not try to pacify him

02:36.800 --> 02:43.680
or sort of try to negotiate with him,

02:43.840 --> 02:49.720
or also sometimes people try to pamper his vanity.

02:49.880 --> 02:53.840
By doing that you are spoiling him more.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.200
So the best thing is to show your love

02:58.360 --> 03:03.840
in very sweet and different manner.

03:04.680 --> 03:08.880
I'll give you an example which I've given many a times,

03:09.040 --> 03:12.640
that I went to see this Gagangarh Maharaj

03:12.800 --> 03:15.880
who was living on a very high mountain,

03:16.040 --> 03:18.880
and there was no way of going by car or anything,

03:19.040 --> 03:20.560
and I had to walk.

03:20.720 --> 03:24.080
So everybody said, “Mother, why should You go there after all?”

03:24.240 --> 03:26.640
I said, “You see the vibrations.

03:26.800 --> 03:31.440
Good vibrations coming, all right? That's why I'm going.”

03:31.600 --> 03:35.400
But he had told many people about Me, and he said that

03:35.560 --> 03:39.640
“Adi Shakti is born in Bombay, why do you come to me?”

03:39.800 --> 03:43.320
So they told us.

03:43.480 --> 03:47.640
So I said, “I must see this man,”

03:48.520 --> 03:52.840
and that's how I went to his place to meet him.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.320
Now, he’s supposed to control the rain.

03:57.960 --> 04:00.080
He could control the rain.

04:00.240 --> 04:08.160
So he was sitting there on a stone

04:08.320 --> 04:15.640
and he was moving his head with great agitation,

04:15.800 --> 04:17.760
when I reached there.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.840
And it was raining so heavily

04:20.960 --> 04:26.440
that I went up to his place when I was completely drenched.

04:26.600 --> 04:31.040
So I went inside the cave where he used to live,

04:31.200 --> 04:41.040
and he came back with great anger towards the rain.

04:41.200 --> 04:44.400
So he said, “Mother,

04:44.560 --> 04:48.040
why did You not allow me to control the rain?”

04:48.200 --> 04:50.240
I said, “I didn't do that.”

04:50.400 --> 04:53.600
“No, You did; because I can always control the rain,

04:53.760 --> 04:57.000
and You were coming all the way with my invitation,

04:57.160 --> 05:00.200
and this rain should not have misbehaved.”

05:00.360 --> 05:02.960
I said, “No, no, he didn't misbehave.”

05:03.120 --> 05:07.440
So what happened, he was quite in a temper, you know.

05:07.600 --> 05:11.840
I said, “You settle down, I’ll tell you what has happened.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.480
See, you have bought a sari for Me

05:15.640 --> 05:18.240
and you are a sanyasi,

05:18.400 --> 05:21.560
and I won't take a sari from a sanyasi,

05:21.720 --> 05:23.960
so the rain has made it convenient.

05:24.080 --> 05:29.000
Now it's all drenched so I'll have to take your sari.”

05:29.160 --> 05:33.920
Immediately, you see, he felt terrible love for Me,

05:34.080 --> 05:39.320
started crying and he fell at My feet.

05:39.480 --> 05:42.680
And then he said, “Mother, now I know

05:42.840 --> 05:46.000
what is the greatness of love,

05:46.160 --> 05:50.960
how it takes you away from mundane things

05:51.160 --> 05:54.800
and dry behavior, and takes you to a place

05:54.960 --> 06:01.880
where you can enjoy the showers of love.”

06:02.040 --> 06:05.520
This is one of the stories I am telling you.

06:05.680 --> 06:10.360
But the main thing behind the whole episode is this,

06:10.520 --> 06:14.920
that you should try your love,

06:15.080 --> 06:18.640
your tricks of pure love, pure love,

06:18.800 --> 06:21.680
and it works.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.960
And you must learn, gradually you will learn how to try.

06:25.160 --> 06:27.000
You should not give up.

06:27.160 --> 06:29.360
Some people are very difficult, I agree

06:29.520 --> 06:31.040
– very, very difficult.

06:31.200 --> 06:35.640
But at least try with people who are not so difficult.

06:35.800 --> 06:38.880
And you'll be amazed that you'll have a good company

06:39.040 --> 06:42.240
and lots of friends and friendship,

06:42.400 --> 06:45.560
as we have here now in Sahaja Yoga.

06:45.720 --> 06:50.120
First time when I came to Delhi I got such a fright of this place,

06:50.280 --> 06:53.040
because there were very few Sahaja yogis

06:53.200 --> 06:56.640
and they brought – I don't know why they wanted to do My puja,

06:56.800 --> 07:00.400
might be Bombay people must have told them, something

07:00.560 --> 07:02.640
– and they brought kum-kum and everything

07:02.800 --> 07:06.080
in a plastic little, little bottles –

07:06.240 --> 07:08.920
oh, ba! I really shrunk, you know, with their ignorance.

07:09.080 --> 07:12.320
I said, “Now what to do? What will happen?”

07:12.480 --> 07:19.360
But today, see, same Delhi which has become so great

07:19.520 --> 07:24.240
and so beautiful, and so enthusiastic.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.960
I saw them with their flags and

07:27.120 --> 07:31.600
I didn't know there’s such a procession of flags will be here,

07:31.760 --> 07:36.000
though we had once or twice, I think, in Cabella.

07:36.160 --> 07:39.760
But how they were enjoying each other!

07:39.920 --> 07:42.160
It's really remarkable.

07:42.320 --> 07:44.760
If you can enjoy love,

07:44.920 --> 07:47.520
you won't enjoy anything else

07:47.680 --> 07:52.800
but love for other people, and not for yourself.

07:52.960 --> 07:55.560
On the contrary you will see

07:55.720 --> 08:00.240
that your body, your mind, your thoughts,

08:00.400 --> 08:04.960
everything are directed towards creating love for others,

08:05.120 --> 08:08.160
and not for yourself.

08:08.320 --> 08:12.000
The whole attitude changes.

08:12.160 --> 08:16.680
Like in the darkness you can't see anything,

08:16.840 --> 08:21.560
but even there's a small light, it spreads all over.

08:21.720 --> 08:26.920
Nobody tells the light that “You have to spread the light

08:27.520 --> 08:30.360
all over,” but it does.

08:30.520 --> 08:34.240
In the same way you all are enlightened people,

08:34.400 --> 08:36.880
you are all enlightened with love;

08:37.080 --> 08:41.960
and the light of this love spreads automatically,

08:42.120 --> 08:45.200
spontaneously, sahaj.

08:46.480 --> 08:49.200
I was also very much

08:49.360 --> 08:54.880
enamored the way our Yuva Shakti was dancing and enjoying.

08:55.080 --> 08:57.360
I think it's a very great blessing,

08:57.520 --> 09:00.120
because these days our young children,

09:00.280 --> 09:04.840
our young people are getting astray.

09:04.960 --> 09:08.240
They are not so badly off as in other countries,

09:08.400 --> 09:11.400
but quite a big trend is going on

09:11.560 --> 09:15.720
to spoil them and to make them a, what you’d call

09:15.880 --> 09:21.240
a very Westernized, spoiled personality.

09:21.400 --> 09:25.480
But now I saw so many of these dancing together,

09:25.640 --> 09:28.800
forgetting their caste, creed, everything,

09:28.960 --> 09:32.800
and enjoying each other's company.

09:32.960 --> 09:35.760
This is something has to happen

09:35.920 --> 09:38.720
in this country and in every country,

09:38.880 --> 09:41.320
that we should all feel oneness

09:41.480 --> 09:46.080
and enjoy the oneness with each other.

09:46.240 --> 09:51.240
If we do not enjoy we are like a drop outside the ocean,

09:51.400 --> 09:53.520
which can be dried any time.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.760
But if you are a part and a parcel of that ocean,

09:56.920 --> 10:03.880
then what happens is that every movement of the ocean

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
you carry with you,

10:06.160 --> 10:11.040
and you are part and parcel of that ocean absolutely,

10:11.200 --> 10:16.240
because you do not have separate identity.

10:16.400 --> 10:20.400
All these things that make a separate identity

10:20.560 --> 10:24.720
in our society or in our culture

10:24.880 --> 10:29.600
or in our behavior, in personal lives,

10:29.760 --> 10:33.880
all should be completely curbed down.

10:34.040 --> 10:36.880
And this will settle many problems,

10:37.040 --> 10:41.400
from family life to national life, to international life.

10:41.560 --> 10:44.720
So we should curb down all such feelings

10:44.880 --> 10:46.560
of separatedness,

10:46.720 --> 10:48.720
that we should have a separate house,

10:48.880 --> 10:53.480
separate state, separate nation.

10:54.360 --> 10:58.120
Gradually all nations will become one, I am sure of that;

10:58.280 --> 11:03.080
because great times are coming, and so many people

11:03.240 --> 11:06.600
at the helm of affairs will take to Sahaja Yoga.

11:06.760 --> 11:08.640
Once they take to Sahaja Yog,

11:08.800 --> 11:11.600
then things will be very much different.

11:11.760 --> 11:15.080
Today it is not with them,

11:15.240 --> 11:17.720
Sahaja Yoga is not with them.

11:17.880 --> 11:25.080
They have no knowledge of our great movement of love,

11:25.240 --> 11:28.320
so they want to have separate of everything.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.560
They don't know tomorrow they will be scorched away

11:31.720 --> 11:33.600
with the heat around,

11:33.760 --> 11:36.920
or maybe with the rain they’ll be washed away,

11:37.080 --> 11:42.040
or maybe that the Mother Earth might absorb them.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.720
So we all should be together,

11:44.880 --> 11:47.600
whatever may be the differences.

11:47.760 --> 11:49.440
In different families we are born

11:49.600 --> 11:53.160
- after all, all cannot be born in one family.

11:53.320 --> 11:56.320
But now you belong to Sahaja Yoga family,

11:56.480 --> 11:59.480
and this Sahaja Yoga family is one.

11:59.640 --> 12:02.720
It doesn't believe in having separate existence

12:02.880 --> 12:05.640
or separate speciality.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.880
We're all one with each other,

12:08.080 --> 12:12.520
and we don't care what sort of differences are outside.

12:12.680 --> 12:15.360
I was really very much touched,

12:15.520 --> 12:18.960
because now the new year is coming

12:19.160 --> 12:22.320
with a new challenge for all of us

12:22.480 --> 12:23.800
which we have to accept,

12:23.960 --> 12:25.560
that Kali Yuga is over

12:25.720 --> 12:28.600
and we have to establish the Satya Yuga;

12:28.760 --> 12:31.640
for which all of you from every country

12:31.800 --> 12:34.760
should have thinking,

12:34.920 --> 12:38.360
how you can do it in your country and in other country.

12:38.520 --> 12:41.040
What are the problems in another country?

12:41.200 --> 12:42.960
Put your attention outside,

12:43.080 --> 12:46.320
not inside this way that you should say

12:46.480 --> 12:49.840
that I need this, I need that, I need that.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.800
We should know what other people need:

12:54.960 --> 12:57.680
what is their need,

12:57.840 --> 13:02.480
what the people in our society, in our nation,

13:02.640 --> 13:07.120
in our world require?

13:07.280 --> 13:10.640
Better write them down: what do they require?

13:10.800 --> 13:13.480
It's better, it will work; might be,

13:13.640 --> 13:15.120
it might be corrected.

13:15.280 --> 13:18.240
It's very important for Sahaja yogis to sit down

13:18.400 --> 13:21.320
and write down what the world needs,

13:21.480 --> 13:23.600
and what is to be done.

13:23.760 --> 13:26.120
It will be a nice idea for all of you

13:26.280 --> 13:31.000
to really aspire for that kind of homogeneous society

13:31.160 --> 13:33.200
that we have here today.

13:33.360 --> 13:36.040
And we’ll be one day, you will be surprised

13:36.200 --> 13:39.960
that we will be the ones who will guide

13:40.160 --> 13:43.840
and lead the rest of the people with our love,

13:43.960 --> 13:48.080
attention and care.

13:48.240 --> 13:50.120
So it's very important time,

13:50.280 --> 13:53.560
and at this time we should all think on those lines.

13:53.760 --> 13:57.800
Thank you very much. May God bless you.
