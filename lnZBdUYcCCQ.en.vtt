00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.080
I have told them in Hindi language

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.760
that love, you can see one person's love

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.520
manifested in so many eyes here.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.320
And when I saw the enthusiasm

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.880
also My heart got filled with great love, greater love.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.760
So one can see how powerful is this love.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.920
All kinds of bad feelings,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.560
negative thinking

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.680
and also self-destructive elements

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.880
can be corrected and controlled

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.480
very simply in Sahaja Yoga,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.080
if you with sincere heart meditate

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.280
morning and evening, twice.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.800
That time you shouldn't see your watches, of course,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.680
but enjoy, enjoy your meditation.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.760
That will give you such a strength to love others,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.280
to forgive others;

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.880
instead of you feeling bad for small, small things,

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.520
you feeling irritated

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.680
because you think your self-respect is challenged,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:52.160
or else sometimes we become aggressive towards some people,

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.680
very aggressive,

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.120
for no fault of theirs.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.480
Best thing is to see the vibrations of another person.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.240
If the vibrations are bad, no use fighting,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.720
it will create more confusions.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.080
A person who has very bad vibrations,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.720
you can't fight with that person,

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.360
you cannot control that person.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.040
Or a person who is too much of self-importance,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.640
you should not try to pacify him

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.680
or sort of try to negotiate with him,

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.720
or also sometimes people try to pamper his vanity.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.840
By doing that you are spoiling him more.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.200
So the best thing is to show your love

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.840
in very sweet and different manner.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.880
I'll give you an example which I've given many a times,

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.640
that I went to see this Gagangarh Maharaj

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.880
who was living on a very high mountain,

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.880
and there was no way of going by car or anything,

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.560
and I had to walk.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.080
So everybody said, “Mother, why should You go there after all?”

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.640
I said, “You see the vibrations.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.440
Good vibrations coming, all right? That's why I'm going.”

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.400
But he had told many people about Me, and he said that

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.640
“Adi Shakti is born in Bombay, why do you come to me?”

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.320
So they told us.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.640
So I said, “I must see this man,”

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.840
and that's how I went to his place to meet him.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.320
Now, he’s supposed to control the rain.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.080
He could control the rain.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:08.160
So he was sitting there on a stone

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:15.640
and he was moving his head with great agitation,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.760
when I reached there.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.840
And it was raining so heavily

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:26.440
that I went up to his place when I was completely drenched.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.040
So I went inside the cave where he used to live,

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:41.040
and he came back with great anger towards the rain.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.400
So he said, “Mother,

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.040
why did You not allow me to control the rain?”

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.240
I said, “I didn't do that.”

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.600
“No, You did; because I can always control the rain,

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.000
and You were coming all the way with my invitation,

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.200
and this rain should not have misbehaved.”

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.960
I said, “No, no, he didn't misbehave.”

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.440
So what happened, he was quite in a temper, you know.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.840
I said, “You settle down, I’ll tell you what has happened.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.480
See, you have bought a sari for Me

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.240
and you are a sanyasi,

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.560
and I won't take a sari from a sanyasi,

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.960
so the rain has made it convenient.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.000
Now it's all drenched so I'll have to take your sari.”

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.920
Immediately, you see, he felt terrible love for Me,

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.320
started crying and he fell at My feet.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.680
And then he said, “Mother, now I know

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.000
what is the greatness of love,

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.960
how it takes you away from mundane things

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.800
and dry behavior, and takes you to a place

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:01.880
where you can enjoy the showers of love.”

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.520
This is one of the stories I am telling you.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.360
But the main thing behind the whole episode is this,

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.920
that you should try your love,

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.640
your tricks of pure love, pure love,

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.680
and it works.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.960
And you must learn, gradually you will learn how to try.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.000
You should not give up.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.360
Some people are very difficult, I agree

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.040
– very, very difficult.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.640
But at least try with people who are not so difficult.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.880
And you'll be amazed that you'll have a good company

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.240
and lots of friends and friendship,

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.560
as we have here now in Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.120
First time when I came to Delhi I got such a fright of this place,

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.040
because there were very few Sahaja yogis

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.640
and they brought – I don't know why they wanted to do My puja,

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.400
might be Bombay people must have told them, something

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.640
– and they brought kum-kum and everything

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.080
in a plastic little, little bottles –

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.920
oh, ba! I really shrunk, you know, with their ignorance.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.320
I said, “Now what to do? What will happen?”

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:19.360
But today, see, same Delhi which has become so great

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.240
and so beautiful, and so enthusiastic.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.960
I saw them with their flags and

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.600
I didn't know there’s such a procession of flags will be here,

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.000
though we had once or twice, I think, in Cabella.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.760
But how they were enjoying each other!

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.160
It's really remarkable.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.760
If you can enjoy love,

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.520
you won't enjoy anything else

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.800
but love for other people, and not for yourself.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.560
On the contrary you will see

00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:00.240
that your body, your mind, your thoughts,

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.960
everything are directed towards creating love for others,

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.160
and not for yourself.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.000
The whole attitude changes.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.680
Like in the darkness you can't see anything,

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.560
but even there's a small light, it spreads all over.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:26.920
Nobody tells the light that “You have to spread the light

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.360
all over,” but it does.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.240
In the same way you all are enlightened people,

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.880
you are all enlightened with love;

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:41.960
and the light of this love spreads automatically,

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.200
spontaneously, sahaj.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.200
I was also very much

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.880
enamored the way our Yuva Shakti was dancing and enjoying.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.360
I think it's a very great blessing,

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.120
because these days our young children,

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.840
our young people are getting astray.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.240
They are not so badly off as in other countries,

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.400
but quite a big trend is going on

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.720
to spoil them and to make them a, what you’d call

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:21.240
a very Westernized, spoiled personality.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:25.480
But now I saw so many of these dancing together,

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.800
forgetting their caste, creed, everything,

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.800
and enjoying each other's company.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.760
This is something has to happen

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.720
in this country and in every country,

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.320
that we should all feel oneness

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:46.080
and enjoy the oneness with each other.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:51.240
If we do not enjoy we are like a drop outside the ocean,

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.520
which can be dried any time.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.760
But if you are a part and a parcel of that ocean,

00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:03.880
then what happens is that every movement of the ocean

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
you carry with you,

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:11.040
and you are part and parcel of that ocean absolutely,

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:16.240
because you do not have separate identity.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.400
All these things that make a separate identity

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.720
in our society or in our culture

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:29.600
or in our behavior, in personal lives,

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.880
all should be completely curbed down.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.880
And this will settle many problems,

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:41.400
from family life to national life, to international life.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.720
So we should curb down all such feelings

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.560
of separatedness,

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.720
that we should have a separate house,

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:53.480
separate state, separate nation.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.120
Gradually all nations will become one, I am sure of that;

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:03.080
because great times are coming, and so many people

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.600
at the helm of affairs will take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.640
Once they take to Sahaja Yog,

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.600
then things will be very much different.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.080
Today it is not with them,

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.720
Sahaja Yoga is not with them.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:25.080
They have no knowledge of our great movement of love,

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.320
so they want to have separate of everything.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.560
They don't know tomorrow they will be scorched away

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.600
with the heat around,

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.920
or maybe with the rain they’ll be washed away,

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:42.040
or maybe that the Mother Earth might absorb them.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.720
So we all should be together,

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.600
whatever may be the differences.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.440
In different families we are born

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.160
- after all, all cannot be born in one family.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.320
But now you belong to Sahaja Yoga family,

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.480
and this Sahaja Yoga family is one.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.720
It doesn't believe in having separate existence

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.640
or separate speciality.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.880
We're all one with each other,

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.520
and we don't care what sort of differences are outside.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.360
I was really very much touched,

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.960
because now the new year is coming

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.320
with a new challenge for all of us

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.800
which we have to accept,

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.560
that Kali Yuga is over

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.600
and we have to establish the Satya Yuga;

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.640
for which all of you from every country

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.760
should have thinking,

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.360
how you can do it in your country and in other country.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.040
What are the problems in another country?

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.960
Put your attention outside,

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.320
not inside this way that you should say

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.840
that I need this, I need that, I need that.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.800
We should know what other people need:

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.680
what is their need,

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.480
what the people in our society, in our nation,

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:07.120
in our world require?

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.640
Better write them down: what do they require?

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.480
It's better, it will work; might be,

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.120
it might be corrected.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.240
It's very important for Sahaja yogis to sit down

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.320
and write down what the world needs,

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.600
and what is to be done.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.120
It will be a nice idea for all of you

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:31.000
to really aspire for that kind of homogeneous society

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.200
that we have here today.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.040
And we’ll be one day, you will be surprised

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.960
that we will be the ones who will guide

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.840
and lead the rest of the people with our love,

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:48.080
attention and care.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.120
So it's very important time,

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.560
and at this time we should all think on those lines.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.800
Thank you very much. May God bless you.
