00:00:03.277 --> 00:00:05.333
Like today I was talking to a Muslim boy

00:00:05.534 --> 00:00:09.474
and he said that, "Mohammad Sahib was
not an incarnation."

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:14.521
"So what was He?" "He was a human being,
but God has given Him special powers."

00:00:14.722 --> 00:00:21.087
That's a very good thing, because if you
say that He was a human being -

00:00:22.777 --> 00:00:25.994
for human beings it is very good.

00:00:26.474 --> 00:00:31.924
That He was a human being, He came
on this earth,

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:37.114
and we are at par [with incarnations,
you are not ... ?]

00:00:38.875 --> 00:00:41.491
So the awe

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:50.539
and that Shraddha as you call it, that
doesn't come in.

00:00:51.617 --> 00:00:54.509
One starts thinking that you are at par
with Christ,

00:00:54.727 --> 00:00:59.684
at par with Mohammad Sahib, at par
with all these deities. [They are?]

00:01:01.375 --> 00:01:08.647
Like here how people are playing around
with Christ's life.

00:01:10.512 --> 00:01:18.134
They call themselves Christians, and they
show no respect to His life at all,

00:01:18.335 --> 00:01:21.093
because it is the becoming He talked about.

00:01:21.294 --> 00:01:25.992
He didn't talk about all these nonsensical
things.

00:01:26.995 --> 00:01:32.002
Secondly, we show no respect, there's
no awe in our hearts

00:01:32.203 --> 00:01:37.826
that He's the one who has created
universes after universes.

00:01:38.314 --> 00:01:44.067
And what are we, compared to Him!
We sit down on Him like...

00:01:47.615 --> 00:01:52.418
What ego human beings have, like bubbles.

00:01:56.949 --> 00:02:01.619
Of course, He was made of

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:11.414
the Brahma Tattwa itself, the divine love
itself, so He could not be killed.

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:17.571
Moreover He had to be born after Krishna
because Krishna had said that,

00:02:17.772 --> 00:02:25.569
"This divine power of God does not die.
It is not killed."

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:33.525
Just to prove that, He took this form,
this gross form of Christ,

00:02:33.726 --> 00:02:36.129
came on this earth.

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:44.332
But human beings, you know, they have
no eyes to see anything.

00:02:45.096 --> 00:02:52.391
They know what is a diamond, they know
what is a precious cloth is,

00:02:52.592 --> 00:02:56.674
but they don't know what a precious
thing it was that He came on this earth.

00:02:56.875 --> 00:02:59.414
Now think of it.

00:03:00.852 --> 00:03:04.345
The situation was horrible.

00:03:05.648 --> 00:03:12.042
No question of talking to anyone about
God or about Realization.

00:03:12.243 --> 00:03:18.325
But even to talk about dharma itself -

00:03:18.526 --> 00:03:23.562
righteousness - was very difficult.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.577
I mean, what ignorance must have covered
those people that they crucified Him?

00:03:38.671 --> 00:03:45.006
Then, even the disciples never recognized
Christ.

00:03:46.937 --> 00:03:52.543
When He was crucified they said,
"Now He is dead."

00:03:53.997 --> 00:03:58.624
Then when He rose nobody would believe it.

00:03:59.705 --> 00:04:04.918
That all kinds of theories even about
the shroud that they have found out.

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:09.880
Of course, there was a cloth which was
tied on to His face, which was pulled up,

00:04:10.072 --> 00:04:15.256
that's why His face looks that elongated
and disfigured.

00:04:16.242 --> 00:04:22.976
But that cloth was left just there, I mean,
what is so important about that shroud?

00:04:23.177 --> 00:04:32.106
I can't understand. It's the blood of
Christ, one should be ashamed of oneself.

00:04:32.965 --> 00:04:36.928
The ignorance with which people looked
at Him.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.301
You can't imagine if you see from that
angle,

00:04:46.502 --> 00:04:50.485
how people are managing themselves
with their ego

00:04:50.686 --> 00:04:56.251
and living in complete darkness and self-
certifying themselves

00:04:56.452 --> 00:05:01.615
that they are the people who can judge
even God!

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:09.470
And hardly they allowed Him to live
for three, four years.

00:05:12.314 --> 00:05:17.487
He did not do any harm whatsoever
to anyone.

00:05:17.688 --> 00:05:21.614
You cannot blame any community for that.

00:05:21.815 --> 00:05:26.074
If He was born in India, they might have
done the same.

00:05:26.275 --> 00:05:30.048
What did they do to Mohammad Sahib?
The same thing.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.408
But why there are so many thieves

00:05:38.609 --> 00:05:45.403
as shown in His life, only a contrast,
were allowed to get out?

00:05:47.337 --> 00:05:52.005
Why this compromise was possible and why
it was not with Christ?

00:05:52.206 --> 00:05:57.086
Do we also do with us the same thing
today?

00:05:58.793 --> 00:06:05.381
That we compromise ourselves with thieves
who are negative people.

00:06:07.043 --> 00:06:12.709
And we do not mind Christ being crucified.

00:06:16.313 --> 00:06:22.064
Now, as you know that He created all
the Brahmandas.

00:06:24.487 --> 00:06:29.069
Brahman means an universe. Now
the universe of the Sun.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:35.393
Out of that universes come out this earth,
out of that you have come out.

00:06:37.253 --> 00:06:43.590
And in your Agnya Chakra He has created

00:06:44.608 --> 00:06:48.274
a small Virata, as they call it.

00:06:51.434 --> 00:06:55.026
He exists within your Agnya Chakra.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:04.380
This sacrifice is very, very significant

00:07:04.581 --> 00:07:09.607
and though it is gross, in subtle it
has happened.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:19.536
To take the awareness through this center
of Agnya

00:07:19.947 --> 00:07:26.504
was done by Christ by His crucifixion.

00:07:27.046 --> 00:07:33.481
He came as a gross person, just like
a gross human being.

00:07:35.094 --> 00:07:39.609
His body died,

00:07:42.294 --> 00:07:48.517
but did not die. Because that body was
also made of

00:07:51.248 --> 00:08:00.556
that imperishable divine vibrations, as you
call, radiations or this Brahma.

00:08:01.329 --> 00:08:07.048
They did not die and that's why the body
did not die

00:08:07.249 --> 00:08:10.738
and He resurrected with His body.

00:08:11.177 --> 00:08:17.553
He had to die to show that the body though
dies, can be saved.

00:08:17.754 --> 00:08:20.830
That's why He had to be crucified.

00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:24.520
Otherwise He could not have shown you.

00:08:24.721 --> 00:08:30.569
But it is actually, it was experimented
in the Vaikuntha as you call it

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:38.970
that He died and then resurrected to show
that this does not die.

00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:44.841
Krishna has said, “Nainam chhindanti
shastrani, nainam dahati pavakah”:

00:08:45.065 --> 00:08:49.667
It is not killed by any weapon,

00:08:49.868 --> 00:08:53.491
neither it is burned by any fires,

00:08:53.692 --> 00:08:59.432
nor it is blown by any wind.

00:08:59.633 --> 00:09:08.017
“Na chainam claydayantya po na shoshayati
marutah”: Neither, nothing can suck in.

00:09:10.915 --> 00:09:14.184
That Spirit is He.

00:09:15.924 --> 00:09:22.263
When they saw Him being resurrected then
they started saying, "Oh! He was the one."

00:09:22.765 --> 00:09:27.670
Then His disciples believed Him.
What ignorance!

00:09:27.871 --> 00:09:32.796
What darkness! What darkness!

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:39.503
It's like telling an ant about human
civilization.

00:09:43.743 --> 00:09:47.036
And this gross happening took place

00:09:47.237 --> 00:09:52.013
when in the subtle also the same happening
had to take place.

00:09:53.055 --> 00:09:59.379
Like when you say Moses crossed the river,

00:10:00.087 --> 00:10:06.751
this was the happening of Void being
crossed by the Primordial Master.

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:16.324
So in the subtle, whatever is done, is
expressed in the gross in this manner.

00:10:16.827 --> 00:10:21.865
And this exactly what happened when Christ
was crucified.

00:10:23.908 --> 00:10:28.686
But again, you cannot crucify Him.

00:10:30.461 --> 00:10:34.441
Now He has become Ekadesha Rudra
as described,

00:10:34.642 --> 00:10:37.792
the eleven Rudras as you know very well.

00:10:37.993 --> 00:10:42.290
These are all the powers of Shiva given
to Him.

00:10:42.491 --> 00:10:46.420
Up till now, till He was born,

00:10:46.621 --> 00:10:52.127
Krishna had given Him His powers, and that
He became Mahavirat.

00:10:52.328 --> 00:10:58.743
He was even placed above Krishna.
But now,

00:10:59.251 --> 00:11:03.688
when He will come, He will be bestowed
with the destructive powers of Shiva,

00:11:03.889 --> 00:11:09.229
eleven of them. One is sufficient to finish
all the universes.

00:11:12.802 --> 00:11:19.500
And that's what is described as the coming
of the Christ.

00:11:19.701 --> 00:11:23.646
You cannot crucify Him anymore.

00:11:25.815 --> 00:11:33.110
And the time has come for all of us to be
prepared for us to receive Him.

00:11:34.279 --> 00:11:37.581
We are not yet ready to receive Him.

00:11:38.353 --> 00:11:41.489
Unless and until you are realized, you
cannot receive Him,

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:45.916
because if you remain un-realized till
He comes,

00:11:46.117 --> 00:11:48.688
you'll be finished, you'll be gone,
you'll be destroyed.

00:11:48.889 --> 00:11:54.215
He'll just come to destroy all
the nonsensical things.

00:11:56.232 --> 00:11:59.888
So this short time should be used

00:12:00.787 --> 00:12:06.470
for your emancipation and for your
development.

00:12:06.972 --> 00:12:14.275
Now, when we think of Christ, how human
beings, you see, put up pretensions.

00:12:14.476 --> 00:12:17.836
All kinds of pretensions, you see,

00:12:18.021 --> 00:12:25.236
like they act, enact how Christ was
crucified.

00:12:25.437 --> 00:12:33.412
They'll wear all the beautiful jewels and
everything and they will enact.

00:12:33.613 --> 00:12:36.730
It's mockery going on.

00:12:38.398 --> 00:12:41.204
If you have to really come to resurrection

00:12:41.405 --> 00:12:46.430
then you must awaken Christ within yourself
in the Agnya Chakra.

00:12:49.264 --> 00:12:51.946
If you cannot do it, all this enactment,

00:12:52.147 --> 00:12:59.320
even I have seen some people in Spain,
they say, are enacting as crucified.

00:12:59.521 --> 00:13:03.608
I mean, this is mockery going on in this
world.

00:13:03.809 --> 00:13:08.000
We are living with pretensions and
falsehoods.

00:13:08.724 --> 00:13:12.512
All these things are going to take us
nowhere.

00:13:12.713 --> 00:13:18.833
We have to face ourselves, we have to awaken
Christ within ourselves.

00:13:19.034 --> 00:13:25.893
We have to bow to Him in full understanding
of how great He is.

00:13:27.126 --> 00:13:34.241
On the contrary, we always bend towards
people who are pretentious,

00:13:34.442 --> 00:13:39.459
who make a circus out of Him. It's a mockery
going on everywhere.

00:13:47.467 --> 00:13:55.413
This carrying the cross or any drama,
I mean, it was such a miserable thing.

00:13:55.716 --> 00:13:59.044
And to enact it - I don't know why people
want to do that,

00:13:59.245 --> 00:14:02.746
I just can't understand, I can't bear it.

00:14:03.669 --> 00:14:07.376
But I mean if you have feelings, you can
see within yourself.

00:14:07.577 --> 00:14:13.276
It cannot be a ceremony, a ritual -

00:14:17.195 --> 00:14:23.132
to be sacrificed and to be resurrected.

00:14:23.333 --> 00:14:30.026
It's the actuality, is the becoming, is not
any drama.

00:14:31.957 --> 00:14:36.827
And people want to see a drama like that
and be satisfied.

00:14:40.236 --> 00:14:46.678
For us Sahaja Yogis it is important to
understand the significance of Christ's life.

00:14:46.879 --> 00:14:52.930
That His body was the only body was made
of these radiations.

00:14:53.131 --> 00:14:58.190
All other bodies were human bodies.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:05.594
All incarnations, even that of Krishna's,
when He came on this earth

00:15:05.795 --> 00:15:16.380
were having human qualities that Mother
Earth existed in the body.

00:15:18.144 --> 00:15:22.185
Now the Mother Earth exists as a magnetic
force,

00:15:22.386 --> 00:15:29.858
She's nothing but a magnetic force.
If the magnetic force

00:15:31.306 --> 00:15:42.542
is the only part of the energy of Christ,
then it cannot be destroyed.

00:15:45.963 --> 00:15:56.288
But we are, as we human beings are,
we are very gross

00:15:56.489 --> 00:16:00.650
and the magnetic force of the Mother Earth
also we do not know.

00:16:00.851 --> 00:16:04.017
We do not feel it within ourselves.

00:16:04.218 --> 00:16:08.678
The day we start feeling that magnetic
force within us, we'll give up

00:16:08.879 --> 00:16:12.921
all these nonsensical movements
of extremes.

00:16:13.122 --> 00:16:17.453
We'll settle down into our gravity.

00:16:18.919 --> 00:16:24.312
But we are not even sensitive to that
magnetic force as the birds are.

00:16:24.513 --> 00:16:28.537
After Realization you do become

00:16:29.537 --> 00:16:34.440
subtle enough to feel that magnetic force.

00:16:34.833 --> 00:16:37.850
And you can ask the Mother Earth to take
away your problems,

00:16:38.051 --> 00:16:41.432
to take away your sins, She'll suck in.

00:16:41.633 --> 00:16:45.335
Once you become that subtle, She'll work it
out, no doubt,

00:16:45.536 --> 00:16:48.858
but you have to become that subtle.

00:16:49.812 --> 00:16:55.676
Unless and until you become that evolved,
you cannot touch

00:16:55.877 --> 00:16:59.262
Her subtler side, which is the magnetic
force.

00:16:59.463 --> 00:17:04.818
While Christ's body was made of that
magnetic force itself.

00:17:14.456 --> 00:17:18.898
Now, when He was resurrected,

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:27.183
they celebrate the Sunday, because
as you have seen that

00:17:27.384 --> 00:17:31.808
He has millions and millions suns and He
is made of Sun.

00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:35.543
He is the essence of Sun.

00:17:39.251 --> 00:17:46.668
The Sun has got the force of oxygen
within it.

00:17:48.052 --> 00:17:56.817
And this oxygen is responsible for creating
Brahmandas after Brahmandas.

00:17:58.978 --> 00:18:05.595
You see, when the Sun's rays fall on the
tree, we take everything for so granted,

00:18:05.796 --> 00:18:10.006
the tree blossoms,

00:18:11.238 --> 00:18:14.635
yield fruits, the fruits have

00:18:14.836 --> 00:18:20.267
seeds and then again they sprout into
trees.

00:18:21.078 --> 00:18:27.461
Without the Sun nothing could exist on this
earth.

00:18:28.956 --> 00:18:35.294
And that is why we worship Him on a Sunday,

00:18:36.265 --> 00:18:42.028
because He was Sun. Actually, He resides
in the Sun, we can say.

00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:50.019
Now when we go to the left,

00:18:50.878 --> 00:18:56.789
we actually go very much away from Him,
to the negative side.

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:05.398
We become very negative, like when we go
to the left side, which you know,

00:19:05.797 --> 00:19:09.744
we go very much away from Him

00:19:10.325 --> 00:19:17.555
and our Agnya gets caught up as you say,
the back side of it.

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:22.950
You go to your right extremes,

00:19:24.421 --> 00:19:29.393
then you disown Him, you cross your
limits.

00:19:30.418 --> 00:19:33.544
You cannot go beyond Him,

00:19:34.824 --> 00:19:38.654
and that is how when you go to the right

00:19:38.957 --> 00:19:48.399
you cross all sense of decency, decorum
and humility.

00:19:48.949 --> 00:19:57.067
So in both ways you go in the opposite
directions much away from Him.

00:19:57.268 --> 00:20:01.542
Ego is the result of right-hand movement,

00:20:02.147 --> 00:20:07.060
because the Christ essence

00:20:08.477 --> 00:20:12.732
does not create the necessary action

00:20:13.147 --> 00:20:20.613
on people who move too much to the right
and also on the left.

00:20:20.814 --> 00:20:26.900
So on one side He fights the left side,

00:20:27.267 --> 00:20:32.892
the super Ego, on the other He fights
the Ego in human beings.

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:39.762
That's why you've seen, if you are possessed
you have to take the name of Christ.

00:20:40.334 --> 00:20:45.798
Only His name can take you away from
your possessions.

00:20:45.999 --> 00:20:54.137
Lord's prayer has got all the essences to

00:20:56.979 --> 00:21:00.645
take away the possessions.

00:21:03.051 --> 00:21:06.761
But not Lord's prayer said by any Dick,
Tom and Harry.

00:21:06.962 --> 00:21:11.304
He is to be connected with Lord Jesus
Christ,

00:21:11.513 --> 00:21:19.520
then only if you say it has an effect and
such a mantra is an awakened mantra.

00:21:20.396 --> 00:21:24.929
Right-hand side when you move,

00:21:25.233 --> 00:21:29.821
you have to be humble in your heart.

00:21:30.022 --> 00:21:36.004
Because He resides in your heart as Spirit,
because He is the Spirit.

00:21:41.157 --> 00:21:44.231
And this Spirit

00:21:48.221 --> 00:21:53.898
gets insulted when you go too much
on the right-hand side

00:21:54.099 --> 00:21:59.072
and that's why ego-oriented people get
a heart trouble.

00:22:00.352 --> 00:22:03.388
On the left-hand side,

00:22:04.381 --> 00:22:11.718
in the super ego area Christ is a terror!

00:22:13.701 --> 00:22:16.937
They are frightened of His name.

00:22:18.138 --> 00:22:25.693
They run away from Him because they
know the Ekadesha Rudra that He is.

00:22:25.894 --> 00:22:29.117
So on one side

00:22:29.341 --> 00:22:34.311
He is mild in the sense He recedes from -
away from the people who are egoistical,

00:22:34.512 --> 00:22:38.875
ego-oriented, He doesn't like buffoons
and idiots.

00:22:39.076 --> 00:22:43.508
Donkeys that He was riding - is
the suggestion of these donkeys

00:22:43.709 --> 00:22:48.895
who are ego-oriented, He tried to control
the donkey.

00:22:49.534 --> 00:22:54.289
But the left-hand side are the people,
these horrible negative people,

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:59.297
they get frightened of Him. Absolutely
frightened, you take Christ's name,

00:22:59.498 --> 00:23:02.274
and they just run away, depart, "No,
nothing doing,

00:23:02.475 --> 00:23:05.404
we are not going to face Him. Oh God,
He's come."

00:23:05.665 --> 00:23:11.093
Now this mark is the sign of His blood
actually.

00:23:12.563 --> 00:23:18.580
And that's why this sign is described
as the persons.

00:23:19.098 --> 00:23:24.886
Even if you show this color they run away.

00:23:27.792 --> 00:23:32.757
But one has to understand the significance
of Christ,

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:37.541
with patience, with humility,

00:23:37.742 --> 00:23:44.319
because He is the one who has created
universes after universes.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.893
Here you cannot just sit on a table,

00:23:47.094 --> 00:23:51.613
let's have it out or see, let's discuss it.
It's no dogma going on.

00:23:51.814 --> 00:23:59.615
He is a living God and living God cannot
be discussed by human beings.

00:23:59.816 --> 00:24:05.974
You have to become Super human beings
to discuss Him, to understand Him.

00:24:06.175 --> 00:24:14.281
And the more you rise, the more you are
filled with awe, "Oh God!"

00:24:18.227 --> 00:24:27.399
And when you realize that He is the support
of the universe, He is our support,

00:24:27.766 --> 00:24:37.603
then you feel very powerful. That nobody
can possess you if He is your support.

00:24:37.804 --> 00:24:42.242
But you cannot just - sort of possess
Christ as your own.

00:24:42.443 --> 00:24:47.508
You cannot say, "Oh! The Christ is mine."
You know, nobody can possess Him.

00:24:48.543 --> 00:24:52.986
You have to surrender to Him

00:24:53.187 --> 00:25:00.865
so that you become His possessions.
So that He looks after you.

00:25:01.502 --> 00:25:07.831
His greatness cannot be described in words.

00:25:09.691 --> 00:25:15.472
As a child, as a son He is the giver
of joy.

00:25:17.902 --> 00:25:25.235
One cannot describe how He looked after
His mother, it's impossible.

00:25:30.411 --> 00:25:33.634
No words can describe

00:25:35.715 --> 00:25:40.009
the understanding of Christ for His Mother,

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:45.121
His love, His gentleness, His care,

00:25:45.322 --> 00:25:52.117
His devotion, dedication, His Shraddha
cannot be described.

00:25:55.127 --> 00:26:03.928
And you know that He came as an evolved
Shri Ganesh.

00:26:05.975 --> 00:26:11.012
At the back He is Shri Ganesh, in front
He's Kartikeya,

00:26:11.213 --> 00:26:14.921
very powerful, eleven Rudras.

00:26:19.619 --> 00:26:21.842
And this

00:26:24.157 --> 00:26:29.366
has given Him the highest position.

00:26:30.716 --> 00:26:33.432
So on this day

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:39.815
we have to think how He was resurrected
for us.

00:26:44.292 --> 00:26:51.007
More than Him, His mother had to suffer
His crucifixion, it was too much.

00:26:53.898 --> 00:27:01.043
Because She knew all about Him. She knew
all this was going to happen

00:27:01.878 --> 00:27:06.796
and She was in a human form as a mother

00:27:07.798 --> 00:27:15.371
and Her only loving son being crucified
in Her presence.

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:23.252
We should not glorify the cross for one
reason,

00:27:23.453 --> 00:27:27.249
because Christ was crucified on that.

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:32.256
But cross is the sign of the Agnya Chakra
also.

00:27:33.861 --> 00:27:43.922
Because the same Swastika, which was
tetravalent, equally distributed

00:27:44.139 --> 00:27:51.688
is expressed as an evolved symbol that is
a cross.

00:27:54.237 --> 00:28:01.530
So when we glorify cross, we are glorifying
our Agnya,

00:28:01.731 --> 00:28:09.714
by which we accept the life of dedication
and of sacrifice.

00:28:13.473 --> 00:28:22.415
And if we look forward after the cross

00:28:22.616 --> 00:28:27.539
we know that it is resurrection.

00:28:27.975 --> 00:28:33.815
And the resurrection that you are going
to actualize in this lifetime.

00:28:36.595 --> 00:28:45.954
But now give up all nonsensical ideas about
your seekings and useless rumblings.

00:28:46.806 --> 00:28:53.572
Seeking means, not knowing about anything,
but becoming something.

00:28:53.773 --> 00:28:58.681
For that Christ crucified Himself.

00:28:58.897 --> 00:29:03.894
He resurrected Himself so that you all
could be resurrected.

00:29:05.062 --> 00:29:16.589
So you have to, today thank Him
for giving you the lead of resurrection.

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:20.632
And in this life time only you are going
to be resurrected

00:29:20.872 --> 00:29:24.037
and you are going to see with your own eyes
your resurrection -

00:29:24.238 --> 00:29:28.696
as the disciples saw the resurrection
of Christ.

00:29:31.904 --> 00:29:37.278
This is being all promised and this must
happen to all of you.

00:29:37.502 --> 00:29:44.725
So we should rejoice and be happy that
the time has come for a mass resurrection

00:29:46.252 --> 00:29:50.892
and such a great event we are facing,
we are such fortunate people.

00:29:51.093 --> 00:30:01.727
Give up our small visions and our petty
hankerings,

00:30:01.928 --> 00:30:06.894
our small, little lives in which we live
like frogs.

00:30:07.356 --> 00:30:16.266
Expand yourself and think that today you
are facing the drama of mass resurrection.

00:30:17.054 --> 00:30:20.650
Not only that but you are maneuvering it.

00:30:22.755 --> 00:30:29.581
So rejoice and be happy. That's what Christ
did 2.000 years back,

00:30:29.782 --> 00:30:33.543
today we are going to do it.

00:30:34.743 --> 00:30:39.280
That's why Easter is a special day for all
of us.

00:30:39.481 --> 00:30:43.637
Is really a very special day,

00:30:43.877 --> 00:30:51.508
because in our lives the death has died
and we are resurrected.

00:30:53.081 --> 00:30:55.111
May God bless you all!
