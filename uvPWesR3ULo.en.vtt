00:03.277 --> 00:05.333
Like today I was talking to a Muslim boy

00:05.534 --> 00:09.474
and he said that, "Mohammad Sahib was
not an incarnation."

00:09.675 --> 00:14.521
"So what was He?" "He was a human being,
but God has given Him special powers."

00:14.722 --> 00:21.087
That's a very good thing, because if you
say that He was a human being -

00:22.777 --> 00:25.994
for human beings it is very good.

00:26.474 --> 00:31.924
That He was a human being, He came
on this earth,

00:33.499 --> 00:37.114
and we are at par [with incarnations,
you are not ... ?]

00:38.875 --> 00:41.491
So the awe

00:43.619 --> 00:50.539
and that Shraddha as you call it, that
doesn't come in.

00:51.617 --> 00:54.509
One starts thinking that you are at par
with Christ,

00:54.727 --> 00:59.684
at par with Mohammad Sahib, at par
with all these deities. [They are?]

01:01.375 --> 01:08.647
Like here how people are playing around
with Christ's life.

01:10.512 --> 01:18.134
They call themselves Christians, and they
show no respect to His life at all,

01:18.335 --> 01:21.093
because it is the becoming He talked about.

01:21.294 --> 01:25.992
He didn't talk about all these nonsensical
things.

01:26.995 --> 01:32.002
Secondly, we show no respect, there's
no awe in our hearts

01:32.203 --> 01:37.826
that He's the one who has created
universes after universes.

01:38.314 --> 01:44.067
And what are we, compared to Him!
We sit down on Him like...

01:47.615 --> 01:52.418
What ego human beings have, like bubbles.

01:56.949 --> 02:01.619
Of course, He was made of

02:04.400 --> 02:11.414
the Brahma Tattwa itself, the divine love
itself, so He could not be killed.

02:11.639 --> 02:17.571
Moreover He had to be born after Krishna
because Krishna had said that,

02:17.772 --> 02:25.569
"This divine power of God does not die.
It is not killed."

02:27.499 --> 02:33.525
Just to prove that, He took this form,
this gross form of Christ,

02:33.726 --> 02:36.129
came on this earth.

02:37.759 --> 02:44.332
But human beings, you know, they have
no eyes to see anything.

02:45.096 --> 02:52.391
They know what is a diamond, they know
what is a precious cloth is,

02:52.592 --> 02:56.674
but they don't know what a precious
thing it was that He came on this earth.

02:56.875 --> 02:59.414
Now think of it.

03:00.852 --> 03:04.345
The situation was horrible.

03:05.648 --> 03:12.042
No question of talking to anyone about
God or about Realization.

03:12.243 --> 03:18.325
But even to talk about dharma itself -

03:18.526 --> 03:23.562
righteousness - was very difficult.

03:24.500 --> 03:30.577
I mean, what ignorance must have covered
those people that they crucified Him?

03:38.671 --> 03:45.006
Then, even the disciples never recognized
Christ.

03:46.937 --> 03:52.543
When He was crucified they said,
"Now He is dead."

03:53.997 --> 03:58.624
Then when He rose nobody would believe it.

03:59.705 --> 04:04.918
That all kinds of theories even about
the shroud that they have found out.

04:05.659 --> 04:09.880
Of course, there was a cloth which was
tied on to His face, which was pulled up,

04:10.072 --> 04:15.256
that's why His face looks that elongated
and disfigured.

04:16.242 --> 04:22.976
But that cloth was left just there, I mean,
what is so important about that shroud?

04:23.177 --> 04:32.106
I can't understand. It's the blood of
Christ, one should be ashamed of oneself.

04:32.965 --> 04:36.928
The ignorance with which people looked
at Him.

04:42.120 --> 04:46.301
You can't imagine if you see from that
angle,

04:46.502 --> 04:50.485
how people are managing themselves
with their ego

04:50.686 --> 04:56.251
and living in complete darkness and self-
certifying themselves

04:56.452 --> 05:01.615
that they are the people who can judge
even God!

05:04.379 --> 05:09.470
And hardly they allowed Him to live
for three, four years.

05:12.314 --> 05:17.487
He did not do any harm whatsoever
to anyone.

05:17.688 --> 05:21.614
You cannot blame any community for that.

05:21.815 --> 05:26.074
If He was born in India, they might have
done the same.

05:26.275 --> 05:30.048
What did they do to Mohammad Sahib?
The same thing.

05:32.240 --> 05:38.408
But why there are so many thieves

05:38.609 --> 05:45.403
as shown in His life, only a contrast,
were allowed to get out?

05:47.337 --> 05:52.005
Why this compromise was possible and why
it was not with Christ?

05:52.206 --> 05:57.086
Do we also do with us the same thing
today?

05:58.793 --> 06:05.381
That we compromise ourselves with thieves
who are negative people.

06:07.043 --> 06:12.709
And we do not mind Christ being crucified.

06:16.313 --> 06:22.064
Now, as you know that He created all
the Brahmandas.

06:24.487 --> 06:29.069
Brahman means an universe. Now
the universe of the Sun.

06:29.270 --> 06:35.393
Out of that universes come out this earth,
out of that you have come out.

06:37.253 --> 06:43.590
And in your Agnya Chakra He has created

06:44.608 --> 06:48.274
a small Virata, as they call it.

06:51.434 --> 06:55.026
He exists within your Agnya Chakra.

06:59.330 --> 07:04.380
This sacrifice is very, very significant

07:04.581 --> 07:09.607
and though it is gross, in subtle it
has happened.

07:11.640 --> 07:19.536
To take the awareness through this center
of Agnya

07:19.947 --> 07:26.504
was done by Christ by His crucifixion.

07:27.046 --> 07:33.481
He came as a gross person, just like
a gross human being.

07:35.094 --> 07:39.609
His body died,

07:42.294 --> 07:48.517
but did not die. Because that body was
also made of

07:51.248 --> 08:00.556
that imperishable divine vibrations, as you
call, radiations or this Brahma.

08:01.329 --> 08:07.048
They did not die and that's why the body
did not die

08:07.249 --> 08:10.738
and He resurrected with His body.

08:11.177 --> 08:17.553
He had to die to show that the body though
dies, can be saved.

08:17.754 --> 08:20.830
That's why He had to be crucified.

08:22.371 --> 08:24.520
Otherwise He could not have shown you.

08:24.721 --> 08:30.569
But it is actually, it was experimented
in the Vaikuntha as you call it

08:30.770 --> 08:38.970
that He died and then resurrected to show
that this does not die.

08:39.171 --> 08:44.841
Krishna has said, “Nainam chhindanti
shastrani, nainam dahati pavakah”:

08:45.065 --> 08:49.667
It is not killed by any weapon,

08:49.868 --> 08:53.491
neither it is burned by any fires,

08:53.692 --> 08:59.432
nor it is blown by any wind.

08:59.633 --> 09:08.017
“Na chainam claydayantya po na shoshayati
marutah”: Neither, nothing can suck in.

09:10.915 --> 09:14.184
That Spirit is He.

09:15.924 --> 09:22.263
When they saw Him being resurrected then
they started saying, "Oh! He was the one."

09:22.765 --> 09:27.670
Then His disciples believed Him.
What ignorance!

09:27.871 --> 09:32.796
What darkness! What darkness!

09:33.790 --> 09:39.503
It's like telling an ant about human
civilization.

09:43.743 --> 09:47.036
And this gross happening took place

09:47.237 --> 09:52.013
when in the subtle also the same happening
had to take place.

09:53.055 --> 09:59.379
Like when you say Moses crossed the river,

10:00.087 --> 10:06.751
this was the happening of Void being
crossed by the Primordial Master.

10:09.943 --> 10:16.324
So in the subtle, whatever is done, is
expressed in the gross in this manner.

10:16.827 --> 10:21.865
And this exactly what happened when Christ
was crucified.

10:23.908 --> 10:28.686
But again, you cannot crucify Him.

10:30.461 --> 10:34.441
Now He has become Ekadesha Rudra
as described,

10:34.642 --> 10:37.792
the eleven Rudras as you know very well.

10:37.993 --> 10:42.290
These are all the powers of Shiva given
to Him.

10:42.491 --> 10:46.420
Up till now, till He was born,

10:46.621 --> 10:52.127
Krishna had given Him His powers, and that
He became Mahavirat.

10:52.328 --> 10:58.743
He was even placed above Krishna.
But now,

10:59.251 --> 11:03.688
when He will come, He will be bestowed
with the destructive powers of Shiva,

11:03.889 --> 11:09.229
eleven of them. One is sufficient to finish
all the universes.

11:12.802 --> 11:19.500
And that's what is described as the coming
of the Christ.

11:19.701 --> 11:23.646
You cannot crucify Him anymore.

11:25.815 --> 11:33.110
And the time has come for all of us to be
prepared for us to receive Him.

11:34.279 --> 11:37.581
We are not yet ready to receive Him.

11:38.353 --> 11:41.489
Unless and until you are realized, you
cannot receive Him,

11:41.690 --> 11:45.916
because if you remain un-realized till
He comes,

11:46.117 --> 11:48.688
you'll be finished, you'll be gone,
you'll be destroyed.

11:48.889 --> 11:54.215
He'll just come to destroy all
the nonsensical things.

11:56.232 --> 11:59.888
So this short time should be used

12:00.787 --> 12:06.470
for your emancipation and for your
development.

12:06.972 --> 12:14.275
Now, when we think of Christ, how human
beings, you see, put up pretensions.

12:14.476 --> 12:17.836
All kinds of pretensions, you see,

12:18.021 --> 12:25.236
like they act, enact how Christ was
crucified.

12:25.437 --> 12:33.412
They'll wear all the beautiful jewels and
everything and they will enact.

12:33.613 --> 12:36.730
It's mockery going on.

12:38.398 --> 12:41.204
If you have to really come to resurrection

12:41.405 --> 12:46.430
then you must awaken Christ within yourself
in the Agnya Chakra.

12:49.264 --> 12:51.946
If you cannot do it, all this enactment,

12:52.147 --> 12:59.320
even I have seen some people in Spain,
they say, are enacting as crucified.

12:59.521 --> 13:03.608
I mean, this is mockery going on in this
world.

13:03.809 --> 13:08.000
We are living with pretensions and
falsehoods.

13:08.724 --> 13:12.512
All these things are going to take us
nowhere.

13:12.713 --> 13:18.833
We have to face ourselves, we have to awaken
Christ within ourselves.

13:19.034 --> 13:25.893
We have to bow to Him in full understanding
of how great He is.

13:27.126 --> 13:34.241
On the contrary, we always bend towards
people who are pretentious,

13:34.442 --> 13:39.459
who make a circus out of Him. It's a mockery
going on everywhere.

13:47.467 --> 13:55.413
This carrying the cross or any drama,
I mean, it was such a miserable thing.

13:55.716 --> 13:59.044
And to enact it - I don't know why people
want to do that,

13:59.245 --> 14:02.746
I just can't understand, I can't bear it.

14:03.669 --> 14:07.376
But I mean if you have feelings, you can
see within yourself.

14:07.577 --> 14:13.276
It cannot be a ceremony, a ritual -

14:17.195 --> 14:23.132
to be sacrificed and to be resurrected.

14:23.333 --> 14:30.026
It's the actuality, is the becoming, is not
any drama.

14:31.957 --> 14:36.827
And people want to see a drama like that
and be satisfied.

14:40.236 --> 14:46.678
For us Sahaja Yogis it is important to
understand the significance of Christ's life.

14:46.879 --> 14:52.930
That His body was the only body was made
of these radiations.

14:53.131 --> 14:58.190
All other bodies were human bodies.

15:00.120 --> 15:05.594
All incarnations, even that of Krishna's,
when He came on this earth

15:05.795 --> 15:16.380
were having human qualities that Mother
Earth existed in the body.

15:18.144 --> 15:22.185
Now the Mother Earth exists as a magnetic
force,

15:22.386 --> 15:29.858
She's nothing but a magnetic force.
If the magnetic force

15:31.306 --> 15:42.542
is the only part of the energy of Christ,
then it cannot be destroyed.

15:45.963 --> 15:56.288
But we are, as we human beings are,
we are very gross

15:56.489 --> 16:00.650
and the magnetic force of the Mother Earth
also we do not know.

16:00.851 --> 16:04.017
We do not feel it within ourselves.

16:04.218 --> 16:08.678
The day we start feeling that magnetic
force within us, we'll give up

16:08.879 --> 16:12.921
all these nonsensical movements
of extremes.

16:13.122 --> 16:17.453
We'll settle down into our gravity.

16:18.919 --> 16:24.312
But we are not even sensitive to that
magnetic force as the birds are.

16:24.513 --> 16:28.537
After Realization you do become

16:29.537 --> 16:34.440
subtle enough to feel that magnetic force.

16:34.833 --> 16:37.850
And you can ask the Mother Earth to take
away your problems,

16:38.051 --> 16:41.432
to take away your sins, She'll suck in.

16:41.633 --> 16:45.335
Once you become that subtle, She'll work it
out, no doubt,

16:45.536 --> 16:48.858
but you have to become that subtle.

16:49.812 --> 16:55.676
Unless and until you become that evolved,
you cannot touch

16:55.877 --> 16:59.262
Her subtler side, which is the magnetic
force.

16:59.463 --> 17:04.818
While Christ's body was made of that
magnetic force itself.

17:14.456 --> 17:18.898
Now, when He was resurrected,

17:21.360 --> 17:27.183
they celebrate the Sunday, because
as you have seen that

17:27.384 --> 17:31.808
He has millions and millions suns and He
is made of Sun.

17:32.009 --> 17:35.543
He is the essence of Sun.

17:39.251 --> 17:46.668
The Sun has got the force of oxygen
within it.

17:48.052 --> 17:56.817
And this oxygen is responsible for creating
Brahmandas after Brahmandas.

17:58.978 --> 18:05.595
You see, when the Sun's rays fall on the
tree, we take everything for so granted,

18:05.796 --> 18:10.006
the tree blossoms,

18:11.238 --> 18:14.635
yield fruits, the fruits have

18:14.836 --> 18:20.267
seeds and then again they sprout into
trees.

18:21.078 --> 18:27.461
Without the Sun nothing could exist on this
earth.

18:28.956 --> 18:35.294
And that is why we worship Him on a Sunday,

18:36.265 --> 18:42.028
because He was Sun. Actually, He resides
in the Sun, we can say.

18:46.909 --> 18:50.019
Now when we go to the left,

18:50.878 --> 18:56.789
we actually go very much away from Him,
to the negative side.

18:57.370 --> 19:05.398
We become very negative, like when we go
to the left side, which you know,

19:05.797 --> 19:09.744
we go very much away from Him

19:10.325 --> 19:17.555
and our Agnya gets caught up as you say,
the back side of it.

19:19.430 --> 19:22.950
You go to your right extremes,

19:24.421 --> 19:29.393
then you disown Him, you cross your
limits.

19:30.418 --> 19:33.544
You cannot go beyond Him,

19:34.824 --> 19:38.654
and that is how when you go to the right

19:38.957 --> 19:48.399
you cross all sense of decency, decorum
and humility.

19:48.949 --> 19:57.067
So in both ways you go in the opposite
directions much away from Him.

19:57.268 --> 20:01.542
Ego is the result of right-hand movement,

20:02.147 --> 20:07.060
because the Christ essence

20:08.477 --> 20:12.732
does not create the necessary action

20:13.147 --> 20:20.613
on people who move too much to the right
and also on the left.

20:20.814 --> 20:26.900
So on one side He fights the left side,

20:27.267 --> 20:32.892
the super Ego, on the other He fights
the Ego in human beings.

20:33.490 --> 20:39.762
That's why you've seen, if you are possessed
you have to take the name of Christ.

20:40.334 --> 20:45.798
Only His name can take you away from
your possessions.

20:45.999 --> 20:54.137
Lord's prayer has got all the essences to

20:56.979 --> 21:00.645
take away the possessions.

21:03.051 --> 21:06.761
But not Lord's prayer said by any Dick,
Tom and Harry.

21:06.962 --> 21:11.304
He is to be connected with Lord Jesus
Christ,

21:11.513 --> 21:19.520
then only if you say it has an effect and
such a mantra is an awakened mantra.

21:20.396 --> 21:24.929
Right-hand side when you move,

21:25.233 --> 21:29.821
you have to be humble in your heart.

21:30.022 --> 21:36.004
Because He resides in your heart as Spirit,
because He is the Spirit.

21:41.157 --> 21:44.231
And this Spirit

21:48.221 --> 21:53.898
gets insulted when you go too much
on the right-hand side

21:54.099 --> 21:59.072
and that's why ego-oriented people get
a heart trouble.

22:00.352 --> 22:03.388
On the left-hand side,

22:04.381 --> 22:11.718
in the super ego area Christ is a terror!

22:13.701 --> 22:16.937
They are frightened of His name.

22:18.138 --> 22:25.693
They run away from Him because they
know the Ekadesha Rudra that He is.

22:25.894 --> 22:29.117
So on one side

22:29.341 --> 22:34.311
He is mild in the sense He recedes from -
away from the people who are egoistical,

22:34.512 --> 22:38.875
ego-oriented, He doesn't like buffoons
and idiots.

22:39.076 --> 22:43.508
Donkeys that He was riding - is
the suggestion of these donkeys

22:43.709 --> 22:48.895
who are ego-oriented, He tried to control
the donkey.

22:49.534 --> 22:54.289
But the left-hand side are the people,
these horrible negative people,

22:54.490 --> 22:59.297
they get frightened of Him. Absolutely
frightened, you take Christ's name,

22:59.498 --> 23:02.274
and they just run away, depart, "No,
nothing doing,

23:02.475 --> 23:05.404
we are not going to face Him. Oh God,
He's come."

23:05.665 --> 23:11.093
Now this mark is the sign of His blood
actually.

23:12.563 --> 23:18.580
And that's why this sign is described
as the persons.

23:19.098 --> 23:24.886
Even if you show this color they run away.

23:27.792 --> 23:32.757
But one has to understand the significance
of Christ,

23:33.640 --> 23:37.541
with patience, with humility,

23:37.742 --> 23:44.319
because He is the one who has created
universes after universes.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.893
Here you cannot just sit on a table,

23:47.094 --> 23:51.613
let's have it out or see, let's discuss it.
It's no dogma going on.

23:51.814 --> 23:59.615
He is a living God and living God cannot
be discussed by human beings.

23:59.816 --> 24:05.974
You have to become Super human beings
to discuss Him, to understand Him.

24:06.175 --> 24:14.281
And the more you rise, the more you are
filled with awe, "Oh God!"

24:18.227 --> 24:27.399
And when you realize that He is the support
of the universe, He is our support,

24:27.766 --> 24:37.603
then you feel very powerful. That nobody
can possess you if He is your support.

24:37.804 --> 24:42.242
But you cannot just - sort of possess
Christ as your own.

24:42.443 --> 24:47.508
You cannot say, "Oh! The Christ is mine."
You know, nobody can possess Him.

24:48.543 --> 24:52.986
You have to surrender to Him

24:53.187 --> 25:00.865
so that you become His possessions.
So that He looks after you.

25:01.502 --> 25:07.831
His greatness cannot be described in words.

25:09.691 --> 25:15.472
As a child, as a son He is the giver
of joy.

25:17.902 --> 25:25.235
One cannot describe how He looked after
His mother, it's impossible.

25:30.411 --> 25:33.634
No words can describe

25:35.715 --> 25:40.009
the understanding of Christ for His Mother,

25:40.210 --> 25:45.121
His love, His gentleness, His care,

25:45.322 --> 25:52.117
His devotion, dedication, His Shraddha
cannot be described.

25:55.127 --> 26:03.928
And you know that He came as an evolved
Shri Ganesh.

26:05.975 --> 26:11.012
At the back He is Shri Ganesh, in front
He's Kartikeya,

26:11.213 --> 26:14.921
very powerful, eleven Rudras.

26:19.619 --> 26:21.842
And this

26:24.157 --> 26:29.366
has given Him the highest position.

26:30.716 --> 26:33.432
So on this day

26:34.410 --> 26:39.815
we have to think how He was resurrected
for us.

26:44.292 --> 26:51.007
More than Him, His mother had to suffer
His crucifixion, it was too much.

26:53.898 --> 27:01.043
Because She knew all about Him. She knew
all this was going to happen

27:01.878 --> 27:06.796
and She was in a human form as a mother

27:07.798 --> 27:15.371
and Her only loving son being crucified
in Her presence.

27:19.650 --> 27:23.252
We should not glorify the cross for one
reason,

27:23.453 --> 27:27.249
because Christ was crucified on that.

27:27.450 --> 27:32.256
But cross is the sign of the Agnya Chakra
also.

27:33.861 --> 27:43.922
Because the same Swastika, which was
tetravalent, equally distributed

27:44.139 --> 27:51.688
is expressed as an evolved symbol that is
a cross.

27:54.237 --> 28:01.530
So when we glorify cross, we are glorifying
our Agnya,

28:01.731 --> 28:09.714
by which we accept the life of dedication
and of sacrifice.

28:13.473 --> 28:22.415
And if we look forward after the cross

28:22.616 --> 28:27.539
we know that it is resurrection.

28:27.975 --> 28:33.815
And the resurrection that you are going
to actualize in this lifetime.

28:36.595 --> 28:45.954
But now give up all nonsensical ideas about
your seekings and useless rumblings.

28:46.806 --> 28:53.572
Seeking means, not knowing about anything,
but becoming something.

28:53.773 --> 28:58.681
For that Christ crucified Himself.

28:58.897 --> 29:03.894
He resurrected Himself so that you all
could be resurrected.

29:05.062 --> 29:16.589
So you have to, today thank Him
for giving you the lead of resurrection.

29:16.790 --> 29:20.632
And in this life time only you are going
to be resurrected

29:20.872 --> 29:24.037
and you are going to see with your own eyes
your resurrection -

29:24.238 --> 29:28.696
as the disciples saw the resurrection
of Christ.

29:31.904 --> 29:37.278
This is being all promised and this must
happen to all of you.

29:37.502 --> 29:44.725
So we should rejoice and be happy that
the time has come for a mass resurrection

29:46.252 --> 29:50.892
and such a great event we are facing,
we are such fortunate people.

29:51.093 --> 30:01.727
Give up our small visions and our petty
hankerings,

30:01.928 --> 30:06.894
our small, little lives in which we live
like frogs.

30:07.356 --> 30:16.266
Expand yourself and think that today you
are facing the drama of mass resurrection.

30:17.054 --> 30:20.650
Not only that but you are maneuvering it.

30:22.755 --> 30:29.581
So rejoice and be happy. That's what Christ
did 2.000 years back,

30:29.782 --> 30:33.543
today we are going to do it.

30:34.743 --> 30:39.280
That's why Easter is a special day for all
of us.

30:39.481 --> 30:43.637
Is really a very special day,

30:43.877 --> 30:51.508
because in our lives the death has died
and we are resurrected.

30:53.081 --> 30:55.111
May God bless you all!
