00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:16.930
Many people have always asked me that why
God created this Universe.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:23.730
Of course, we are not supposed to ask questions
to God.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.712
It’s easy to ask questions to Mataji when
She is giving a lecture.

00:00:28.712 --> 00:00:33.490
But God is a person who is beyond questions.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:41.239
And why He created Universe is something like
why I wore all these ornaments.

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:53.680
As I am not habituated of wearing ornaments,
but I have to do it.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:01.500
I have to do it just to please you people,
or we can say that God created this earth,

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.250
just to please His own children, just to make
them happy, just to make them enter into the

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.600
Kingdom of God, to give all that what He has
got.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:27.970
So He had to create this creation in such
a way that He could create His own image,

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:36.800
reflect it and make it enjoy itself.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:51.550
It’s a very mutual appreciation, as we call
it, andolan.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:02:01.850
Whatever He does for us, is for His own pleasures.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.810
But the beauty of it is that your pleasure
is His pleasure.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.610
And the other way round is, His pleasure should
be your pleasure, too.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:24.959
Once that becomes the fact that the pleasure
of God becomes your pleasure, you enter into

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:33.580
that beautiful arena of heavenly joy, swargiya
anand.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:45.760
Only if it is one-sided enterprise or one-sided
effort, it gets lost.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:55.690
Human efforts are one-sided, but God’s efforts
are such that they cannot be enjoyed unless

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.930
and until they are reflected by.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:07.420
So whatever He has given us we cannot count
them, we can only say they are blessings,

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.550
because it’s an abstract way of saying things.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:19.550
That is the blessing of God, that He has given
all the blessings.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:29.590
It’s an abstract thing, because we cannot
count, we cannot give it a form, we cannot

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.770
say what He has done for us.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:41.110
And when this joy of His creation is felt
in our heart, once we start enjoying that

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.950
joy within ourselves, then it becomes a complete
picture.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:54.870
When it is complete you cannot describe it,
because it is not relative.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.870
You can just enjoy it.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:07.769
And that is how the depth of enjoyment is
described, that at that depth, what are we

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:08.769
to say?

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:09.989
We are lost.

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.580
The drop has become the ocean and the ocean
has become the drop.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:21.959
First the ocean becomes the drop and then
drop becomes the ocean.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.819
And then the ocean tries to become the drop.

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:36.770
It’s a beautiful system of give and take,
which can only be appreciated by people who

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.699
have tasted the nectar of the beauty of God’s
love.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:50.279
It’s very easy to say there is no God.

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:55.330
It’s the easiest thing to say.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.710
But it is even easier to enjoy God than that.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.779
Is the easiest thing to enjoy Him because
He is so available.

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:04.120
He is so anxious.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.270
The whole purpose of creation is to give you
joy, to give you happiness.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.610
As today when I had to go to the bank, I was
wondering, “I have never worn these ornaments

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:23.300
anytime in life, and today as the time has
come and I have to wear.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.900
” I just thought of it, “It’s just for
my children”.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.105
If I have to wear them, what does it matter?

00:05:29.105 --> 00:05:32.339
Just to make them happy, what does it matter?

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:38.050
If they feel happy, then My happiness is complete.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:46.720
But you felt for Me, that I should wear, itself
shows that you wanted to see them on Me.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:53.479
Is also such esteem of your very subtle bhakti,
very subtle love for your Mother.

00:05:53.479 --> 00:06:00.569
In these modern times, to have such bhaktas,
itself is a big blessing for Me.

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:03.509
So as you say, “Mother, bless us,” I say,
“You also bless Me.

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:11.289
” You have already blessed me by this beautiful
arrangement you have made, the way you have

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:20.080
put yourself, surrendered yourself for this
great puja.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.689
Because all is such an interdependent process.

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:31.190
You do the puja.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.180
I can’t do the puja.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.649
You have to do the puja.

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:40.680
When you do the puja, the chakras are awakened.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.919
Mine are awakened, but in you they are awakened.

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:48.370
Now how to explain to people what is the importance
of puja is.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:56.710
If you have not tasted the fruit of a puja
it is impossible to explain.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:06.539
It is at a higher level only one can understand
all these things.

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:14.939
But so far whatever was done was at such a
lower level by such low type of people that

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:16.080
everything became absolutely unholy.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:32.960
It was all unholy doing and because of that
unholy doing God himself is unhappy.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:40.089
So He has created this Universe to create
realized souls, not to create useless people,

00:07:40.089 --> 00:07:49.189
not to create people who do not believe in
God, who do not believe in higher life, who

00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:56.929
do not believe in leading a life of purity.

00:07:56.929 --> 00:07:59.719
He never created this Universe for them.

00:07:59.719 --> 00:08:03.889
They are just existing, just like dead people.

00:08:03.889 --> 00:08:06.689
They are not living people.

00:08:06.689 --> 00:08:16.409
So those who believe in God, those who worship
Him with all purity, are actually, in a way,

00:08:16.409 --> 00:08:22.669
giving blessings to God because it is so pleasurable
for Him to see that they have understood,

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:27.479
that they have felt it, that they have liked
it.

00:08:27.479 --> 00:08:31.330
Sahaj Yogis also, some of them have problems,
doesn’t matter.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:39.479
But as long as the desire is pure, your Kundalini
is pure, as long as you feel you that you

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:51.810
have to do your ascent in a proper way, in
a surrendered way, everything is going to

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.960
become a complete beautiful picture.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:11.400
And to create this elevated Kingdom of God
within our heart and without, one has to know

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:19.280
that God’s efforts are absolutely complete.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:24.450
He has made you.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.960
Now only little less is there.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.680
It’s from the other side.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:39.950
He has created this universe so beautifully
and after creating that beautiful universe,

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:45.480
that universe has to reflect God fully.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.220
That’s all.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.090
So the fifty percent job is done.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.360
Only other fifty percent job you have to do.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:58.030
You should not worry if there are people who
are not interested in Sahaj Yog, those who

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:03.760
are not going to do meditation, those who
are not going to do puja, those who do not

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.300
enjoy this higher life.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.450
Just don’t worry about them.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:15.650
But you must know that you are special people,
and that you have to create the nucleus, the

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:25.360
complete body of that part, which is going
to complete this work of great faith.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:36.860
Today I am so enamoured that the speed of
everything has come down to zero for Me now.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:37.940
Nothing is moving.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:52.420
There is no gati in Me now left, so enamoured
and overwhelmed by your celebration, by your

00:10:52.420 --> 00:11:01.970
kindness, that I just don’t know how to
express Myself.

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:09.730
All this is suggestive of such tremendous
depth and gratitude in your hearts for something

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:10.730
I have done nothing whatsoever.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:12.780
I have done nothing, because I have not achieved
anything in life Myself.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.050
I was what I am.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:18.180
I will be the same.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:25.250
I have not done any tapasya or anything.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:33.140
I have not walked even an inch to achieve
my goal.

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:44.130
It’s you who have prepared yourself, who
have come closer and closer, just like a ready

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:55.500
lamp, a Deepak, and got yourself ignited,
enlightened yourself, because of your preparation.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:12:03.100
It’s only your own doing, which has given
this light everywhere.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:10.190
You know very well that light cannot spread
in vacuum.

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:11.700
It cannot spread.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:15.470
If there is vacuum, light cannot spread.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:23.020
That’s why without the Sahaj Yogis, I have
no existence at all.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.490
I don’t exist.

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.580
My whole existence is here because of you.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.920
I have no meaning.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.260
I have no work.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.610
I don’t do any work at all.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:38.120
I am the one who is the laziest and who doesn’t
do any work whatsoever.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.370
It’s only you who have achieved it.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:45.460
It is you who have raised yourself.

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:50.100
Actually, your birthdays must be celebrated,
instead of Mine, because neither I am getting

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.350
old nor young.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:53.440
I am just the same.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.590
There is no difference in anyway.

00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:00.782
And I think it should be the birthday of Sahaj
Yoga which should be celebrated today.

00:13:00.782 --> 00:13:11.770
That we can say today, that it is about twelve
years some months that Sahaj Yoga was started

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:20.110
on a public basis, though I started it long
time back, I don’t know how many years back.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:31.740
So, at this stage we have to understand that
puja is an abstract achievement which can

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:38.860
only be experienced and all of you should
sit with that feeling that we are going to

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:53.140
achieve nothingness within us, egoless, egolessness,
emptiness, cleansing, so that the light of

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:58.620
love should flood all the areas within us.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:08.529
And that is only possible when, of course,
the chakras are to be awakened.

00:14:08.529 --> 00:14:20.580
That’s going to work out and also that you
should open out your hearts completely.

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:27.001
Not to doubt anything, not to think about
anything, but just open your hearts, just

00:14:27.001 --> 00:14:35.320
receive it, with complete faith and understanding.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:42.170
You have people from all over the countries,
so many countries.

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:47.240
All the world is represented here.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:55.620
I feel that already we have touched every
corner of the world.

00:14:55.620 --> 00:15:02.720
On this day only thing we have to declare
that let Sahaja Yoga become a Mahayoga in

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.860
its full way.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:11.660
That everybody in the whole world should recognize
that Sahaj Yoga is the only way people can

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:28.579
rise in their evolution and a new world can
be created.

00:15:28.579 --> 00:15:39.980
And this kind of a development, which is a
collective development, which is not of outer

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:51.050
world but of the inner world, which generate
the roots of this creation into a new dimension,

00:15:51.050 --> 00:16:07.750
into a new personality, because by that time,
the roots would have reached the source, source

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:12.040
of this Divine love, of this All-pervading
Power of this Brahmashakti.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:23.490
Today I would request you, that you all should
take a vow, that all of you will try to bring

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:30.760
more people to Sahaj Yoga and try to save
as many as possible through all your efforts.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:40.480
That’s the only thing if you can give me
on My birthday I’ll be very much thankful.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:44.000
May God bless you all.
