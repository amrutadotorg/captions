00:00:12.404 --> 00:00:16.160
Yogi intro:

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.320
...which has been programmed and set up,
and at that moment it becomes plugged

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.440
into the mains, and it becomes connected.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.040
That's the moment of actualisation.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.560
That's the moment when you become
your Spirit.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.360
This is what we've been seeking.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:42.720
There's no mesmerism,
no intellectual dissertations.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.320
It's a reality, and it's happening.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.560
It's happening on a mass scale.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.000
This is the first time Mataji has been
to America since 1972.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.080
She came on a visit at that time.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.040
But all over the world, Sahaja Yoga,
as it's called, is taking root.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.600
Thousands upon thousands of people
are getting their realisation.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.280
And when they get it, they're developing
it and settling into it.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.760
Their life is being transformed.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.440
Physical and emotional problems
just fall away.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.120
You start to feel the joy of life.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.360
You can cope with the tensions
and stresses of living.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.080
And you look at the whole
of human existence

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.640
as almost like a bit of a joke.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:33.600
You cope with the problems
in a very wonderful way.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.920
The other beautiful thing
about Self-realisation

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.200
is that as you get it,
you can give it to others.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.440
One light is enlightened,
it can enlighten another light.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.960
And this is the way it has to be.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.880
It's nothing exclusive.
It's nothing that money can buy.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.680
And now, as Mother often says,
on the tree of life

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.760
at first there were very, very few
flowers that turned to fruit.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.960
Now all the flowers have come,
the blossom time has come.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.160
And many, many of those flowers
have to turn to fruit.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.200
This is the right of the seekers.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.760
This is the right which you've earned
and which you must pursue.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.240
Mother has nothing to gain from this.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.760
She travels around the world.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:35.440
She is a mother, she is a grandmother,
she is the wife of an important

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.440
Secretary General
of the United Nations.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.600
So she has no basis for needing
any support of any kind from us.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.120
She only gives.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.840
And in giving, she is giving nothing
but love and compassion.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.840
And that's the power of Divine Love.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.760
That's the power of a great spiritual
being to awaken that which is within us

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.000
and which is our right.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.680
So during this lecture
simply slip your shoes off

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.440
and hold your hands out in this fashion
so that you can actually become

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.920
earthed to the earth.
That's the purpose.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.240
It's as simple as that.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.480
It's a very, very basic
electrical circuitry.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.800
And just simply hold the hands out
in that fashion

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.160
as if asking for something,
as if asking for something.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.200
It's as simple as that.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.960
And what you perhaps begin to find
is that during the talk

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.800
you'll start to feel the vibrations.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.600
These vibrations are the vibrations
which have been spoken of

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.120
in all the scriptures.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.440
If you're a Christian it speaks
of the cool wind of the Holy Spirit.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.400
If you're a Muslim it's the Ruh.
And so it goes on.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:01.120
So again I'll introduce to you
our mother, Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.760
Shri Mataji: It’s really unbelievable isn’t it?
It sounds so fantastic.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:13.200
I have been here about nine years back
and I told them that, "It’s within you,

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.160
there’s a simplest thing,
is a living process;

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.120
it works out, for nothing at all.
It’s your own."

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.440
But what I found, that Americans
were still busy guru shopping;

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.280
they wanted to go through that,
they wanted to do all that.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.240
What could I do?

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.480
I told them, "You don’t have to do
all this.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.920
Why do you want to waste your energy?
Why do you want to waste your money?

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.640
Nothing, you just have it!"
But they wouldn’t.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.680
They wanted to spend their money –
they had the money that time,

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:48.160
they thought they can buy some bhagwans
and gods and things like that.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.240
All sorts of things were on when I came
here, and they wouldn’t listen to me.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.080
They wouldn’t listen to me.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.760
I said, "You cannot purchase it,
you cannot buy it.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.480
They are misleading you."

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:06.160
So I thought, better to retire
for some time from America.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.280
But in India now, in the villages,
we have thousands of people

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.080
who have got realization – it’s so simple.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.560
You are seekers, you are seekers
because the time has come

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.920
that you have to be here
and that you have to get your realization.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.360
It’s very simple.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.480
After all, God has created
this great world;

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.760
this creation is His own
and He has to save it.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.400
Jolly well, He has to do it.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.480
But it is so incredible,
they can’t believe it, it’s impossible.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.360
They think, "How can that be?
We must stand on our heads,"

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.320
or, "We have to pay a lot of money,
we have to become broke,

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.640
we have to give up this, give up that.
Do all sorts of nonsensical things

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.200
and then, what we find?
We are left high and dry."

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.680
It’s true, I know, it’s true.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.440
But you could have avoided it;
when I came here,

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.240
I told people very,
very clearly and plainly.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.400
But I was amazed, also,
apart from this:

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.840
they did all kinds of funny things
about what I announced to them.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.760
I said that you are to be born again.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.960
Alright, they taped me
and they started organizations

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.480
with this name that,
"We are born again" –

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.040
they certified themselves
and they started another organization

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.720
with some vibrations,
something [UNCLEAR Sun]

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:34.240
instead of being honest to yourself
and getting the thing down to Earth.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.520
I didn’t know why they were getting
into these hallucinations

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.983
which is imaginary things.
We have to be just honest to ourselves. That's all.

00:06:42.983 --> 00:06:46.560
It's so simple. It’s extremely simple.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.280
But when you go to these places
and do that,

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.800
you get damaged, you really get damaged.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.600
Of course the task is very difficult now for me,
I find, comparatively.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.400
It would have been much better
[UNCLEAR] no doubt.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.640
But they won’t listen to me,
even up to the point

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.680
that they said, "You must charge
some money.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.920
People are doing it for so much,
so much.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.800
At least charge some money or then
people will have no value for it."

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.360
I said, "If they start valuing it
in money, they’ll never value it."

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.880
It should not be done;
whatever is wrong should not be done.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.880
And they just wouldn’t accept it;
it’s such a funny situation.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:32.240
That’s how I went back;
nine years I waited.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:38.160
But Americans are great seekers,
they are, despite all these damages.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.320
We had a very good experience
the other day,

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.160
with all these people who were there.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:51.440
Especially, we went to Boston where
there were about fifty-four people or so,

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.720
and fifty of them got realization,
just like that.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:00.640
Fifty of them, can you believe it?
I was amazed. It’s expanding.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.080
Consolidation may be a problem,
but that should be consolidated.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:11.360
I did give realization to some here,
and they were quite funny.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.720
They started charging people
for their vibrations.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.080
Just imagine?
They got it without any payment

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.360
or anything, but they started
charging people for it,

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.560
and when they came to India, we found
out they had lost their vibrations.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.960
They were very heated-up people
and we told them,

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.600
"You cannot charge for it.
How do you charge?"

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.880
He said, "How are we to live?"

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.280
I said, "How did you live before?
Live like that."

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.200
"Oh, we were schoolteachers, we were…"

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.040
I said, "Do that. You cannot charge
for these vibrations;

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.520
these are Divine, this is love,
you cannot charge.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.640
How can you sell that?
Can you sell your love?"

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.200
It’s a simple thing Americans
have to understand,

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.920
that you cannot sell it.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.800
It’s too simple for them to understand,
that there could be someone who really

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.600
loves, just loves for love’s sake.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.480
There could be one, at least,
like that in this whole world.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.520
If they understand this,
then it will be easy for them

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:11.200
to understand that all these things
are built-in you;

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.480
they are already made like that.
It’s not at all difficult.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.480
Like a candle which is made properly
and there’s a wick;

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.640
it’s very easy to enlighten that
if you are enlightened.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.640
What do you do?
What goes out of this candle?

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:32.400
It’s nothing. You just enlighten
another light without any difficulties.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:37.600
It’s nothing special, nothing great;
it’s very, very simple.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.800
But we want to make everything
complicated, and what am I to do?

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.200
If you have to eat your food,
you eat like this, isn’t it?

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.600
Do you put your hand down like that?

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.280
If you have to breathe,
which is so vital; it is the simplest.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.080
Do you go to libraries
to read how to breathe?

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.200
It’s all so simple, you won’t believe.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.520
Like sprouting a seed,
it’s a living process;

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:04.400
it has to be simple, spontaneous.
How can it be complicated?

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:09.520
Then, another problem is that here,
people read a lot about God.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.560
You can’t read about Him,
you have to know it.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.760
They just read, "This is the God,
that is the God."

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.640
Today we met somebody who said that,
"I believe in a man

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.000
who calls himself Jesus."

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.360
I said, "Very good, put him on the water.
Can he walk on the water?

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.680
If he can walk on the water,
alright, he’s Jesus.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.160
But does he walk?
Put him on the water."

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.800
It’s very simple. If I say I am something,
I must do it, isn’t it?

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.080
If somebody says, "I can make you fly,"
you start paying him money;

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:43.280
such a lot of money goes to this fellow.
Does he fly?

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.640
If he flies, then he can teach you.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.200
If he does not know himself how to fly,
how will he teach you?

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.440
It’s a very logical thing:
you have to know that

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.760
we are not going to fly anymore now.
We have flown as birds,

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.520
so we are not going to fly or hop –
we have been that.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:04.880
We are going to become something more
in our awareness.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.920
We see the simple thing we should know
that we have to become that.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.000
Something in our own awareness,
something has to happen

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:27.280
that should make us something that we are,
that we should become the Absolute.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.640
We are not what we are,
we are something else –

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:37.120
we are like our, say, mind,
we are our rationality which can go anywhere.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.320
It’s not Absolute.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.880
Supposing somebody comes here,
a Mr. XYZ and says,

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.920
"This is a very nice car."
Another one will come and say,

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:48.960
"Oh, it’s not so good." Another one say,
"Maybe good, maybe."

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.760
Three human beings, all of them
are human beings.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.000
They are not animals,
they are human beings

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.760
from the same place,
from the same village, you can take it.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:02.400
Put them together,
they will have three opinions.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.160
If they continue to have criteria,
we shall say –

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:10.880
see they can have even thousand,
if they change. So why?

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.240
Because they have not got
their absolute values.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:19.120
there must be something absolute
within us, when you start [INAUDIBLE],

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.720
you start feeling the absolute.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.120
As he said, really it happens to you.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:29.760
You become that in no time,
and you can feel it –

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:34.400
on your hands, on your fingers –
the reality.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.320
You ask a simple question,
"Is there God?"

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.160
Somebody told me,
"I don’t believe in Christ."

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.840
I said, "Alright, why? Have you seen Him?
Why don’t you believe?"

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.120
"I don’t believe."

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.520
"But why? What is the reason?"

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.840
"I believe in this
and I don’t believe in that."

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:54.160
"Well, why? Is there any absolute
by which you have judged

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.360
whether there was Christ or not?
Whether it was true or not?

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:01.600
Whether it’s just a myth?"

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.720
"No, I have not."

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:07.520
"Then how can you say ‘I believe’?’
You keep yourself open!"

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.920
First, you become your Self –
that’s like Buddha.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:17.040
He said, "Don’t talk of God or anything.
First of all, let them become the Self.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.360
If they become the Self,
then talk of other things.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.920
Because if they do not, if you talk
of something else,

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:26.080
they will come out with their own ideas,
that, ‘I don’t believe in God,

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.320
I don’t believe in this,
I don’t believe in that.’ "

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.280
So He said, "Alright,
you become your Self,

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.080
that’s the first thing.
Once you become your Self,

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.840
then you will start seeing other things
through your awareness,

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.840
which is something special."

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:44.960
And that’s what should happen to you;
is to first become your Self.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:49.840
Then you start judging other things
because now you have that awareness

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.800
by which you can judge.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.640
How are we to know that –
supposing these vibrations come to us –

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.440
whether they are absolute our not?

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.200
After all, we should find out
whether they are absolute or not.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:08.160
For that, we can use a method
which is I call as a relative method.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:13.960
Today I told them that you get two boys
who are from a lunatic asylum –

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.440
certified mad people.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.600
Then get two people
who have got cancer,

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.240
and then get two people, one realized
soul and one un-realized soul –

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.520
according to me, one is realized,
and one is un-realized.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.480
Now you put all of them to me
and ask them to see their vibrations.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:40.240
You will find the person who is mad –
he will start doing all kinds of actions;

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:49.440
he may feel shaking all over the body;
his whole body might shake like this;

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.880
the whole thing might [UNCLEAR].

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.920
The person with the cancer
will feel terrible heat

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:58.640
getting out of his body, a heat so much
so, it happens sometimes,

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:03.680
that the room does not need a heater –
in London, even during wintertime.

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.880
Now, you have another one
who is not a realized soul.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.000
Such a person may a little bit feel hot,
or something,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.360
and after some time he starts feeling
the cool breeze, gradually,

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.000
for a little bit.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.240
Then you have a realized soul
and a little child sitting.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.320
He said, "I was [UNCLEAR taking] it
when I entered here.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.160
Yes it is there, I know it is there."

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.880
It’s so simple because it is vital.
It’s important;

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.720
evolution is the most important thing.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:35.120
That’s how we have become human beings
and you have to become something higher.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:40.560
It’s all placed within us very nicely,
very safe, very protected.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.360
But, of course, we go headlong
into every sort of thing

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.080
and naturally we get damaged.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.240
With all these beautiful things
within us,

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.280
I see people doing all kinds
of nonsensical things,

00:15:51.280 --> 00:16:04.187
going into all kinds of extremes;
there’s no need to be in extremes.

00:16:04.187 --> 00:16:04.241
Somebody comes and tells them,
"You stand on your head,

00:16:04.241 --> 00:16:04.287
you’ll get to God."
They’ll go on doing it.

00:16:04.287 --> 00:16:06.320
I mean, use your logic, use your brain.
How can you get to God

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.920
by standing on your head?

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:14.720
If it is a living process,
if it’s absolutely living,

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:19.600
then you cannot do anything about it,
because human beings cannot do

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.920
anything that is living.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:28.720
At this time, I had told these people
who got their realization last time

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:36.640
that I will tell them about the Kundalini
and the centres and about what they mean.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:40.000
In any case, we have got now books
for you also,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
to go through them and see what it is,
and you can read them

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.400
and you can find out about it.
But in any case, I will tell you little bit.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:17:00.000
Here is the chart. This is the Kundalini
here in the triangular bone

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.840
called as sacrum.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.760
This is not important to know,
but I am just telling you,

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.280
because you’ll have curiosity later on,
"Where is this Kundalini?"

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.240
This Kundalini is placed
in the triangular bone here,

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.120
called as sacrum.
Now sacrum means sacred;

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.880
so the people knew about this,
that it is a sacred bone.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:04.480
This bone is placed very securely
at the base of the spinal cord.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:14.160
This is kept there as a residual force,
but it is the energy of your desire

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:19.040
of becoming one with the Divine.
It is not yet manifested.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:23.200
That’s why it is called
as a sleeping Kundalini;

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.960
it means that power
has not yet manifested.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:36.560
On the left-hand side this power
that is within us is the power of desire.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.360
On the right-hand side,
there’s another power

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:43.280
which is the power of our action.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:47.760
[The left side] is the one that gives us
our emotional life, our emotional side.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.800
This gives rise to the left
sympathetic nervous system

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:55.680
and is also looking after the psyche,
which the psychologists talk about.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:01.040
But most of them are half-baked,
so they just know about this part

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.760
of the Kundalini,
which they call as the ‘psyche.’

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:07.440
They know very little and when they
try to do anything about it,

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.960
they are so unauthorized that they
create problems for others

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.880
and create problems for themselves.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:17.760
They have no idea as to what we are,
and they just try to meddle

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:21.120
with your psyche,
creating great problems for you.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:27.280
[On the right-hand side] is the power
of action which is responsible for our

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:32.480
mental and physical efforts, because
when we go into action, we put in effort.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:37.120
This is the area where our future lies
[right side]

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.080
and this is the area where our past lies
[left side].

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:46.000
Past of our present life and beyond that
is the collective Subconscious

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.040
which is beyond that.
Beyond this line [right side]

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.120
is the Supra-conscious,
[which] is the future,

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:55.040
and beyond that is the collective
Supra-conscious.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:20:02.240
These are the areas that are within us
and the material side is below,

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.760
and the hell is below that.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.120
When we start getting any experience
in life –

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.840
say, a person is sitting
and suddenly he starts jumping.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.280
He thinks, "I have got
Kundalini awakening."

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.840
How can that be?
If there is Kundalini awakening,

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:22.080
you are in charge of that;
you know you are the master.

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.200
If you do not know what is happening
to you, it is somebody else

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.640
who is doing the tricks.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.040
Maybe you have moved too much
onto the left-hand side

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:33.200
and some spirit has possessed you,
and he is making you jump.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.400
That cannot be any spiritual experience;

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:40.640
spiritual experience is only one
and when you get it,

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:46.000
you become master of your Self.
Unless and until that happens,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.760
one should not accept anything
as a spiritual experience.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:53.680
For example, a master, so called,
who lives in Tibet or something,

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.400
who has died and who is giving
experiences.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.600
All this is all absurd things.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:03.520
You are your own master, no doubt,
but you have to be made into it.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:07.440
Unless and until you are connected
to the mains through this,

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:12.320
unless and until you are baptized,
you are not your Spirit.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:17.840
You are to be actually baptized,
in the sense it’s a living process.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:22.440
Just like a seed sprouts,
a seed’s primule comes out.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:27.120
In the same way, this Kundalini
has to pass through all these chakras

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.080
and enter through your
fontanel bone area,

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.600
awakening this centre.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:37.320
It sucks in the Ego and Superego,
which is created by these two powers here –

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:42.160
Superego and Ego – and just creating
a portion of the head here,

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:46.640
which is called as the
fontanel bone area, very soft,

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.760
and the thing gets out.

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:53.280
You can feel the cool breeze
of the Kundalini.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.480
The Spirit resides in your heart.
Nobody knows.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:01.680
They said, "God is in me."
Where is He? Where is He placed?

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:08.000
He resides in your heart
but you are not aware of it;

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.240
it is not in your conscious mind,
it is not in your central nervous system.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.360
It knows about you,
but you are not conscious of it.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.000
When the Kundalini passes through
these various centres

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.320
and pierces through this one,
then the seat of the Spirit is here,

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.160
the seat of the Spirit.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:30.000
And that’s how, when the Kundalini
touches there, the seat is informed,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.520
like the seat of your government
is Washington:

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:38.320
wherever may be the President,
if the information goes to Washington,

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:44.800
he is informed, like that, this is the seat.
And when it informs, the Spirit knows

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:48.640
about it, and then you start feeling
the cool breeze,

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:52.160
the emitting of the cool breeze
in the hands which is called as

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:58.000
the cool breeze of the Holy Spirit.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:04.800
Some people asked me that,
"Is it cool breeze or hot breeze?"

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:12.240
You know that when there is any friction,
even in the matter, it creates heat.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:16.640
So, it has to be cooled,
but not very cooled; it is not very cool.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:22.080
If you become extremely cold, that also
means that your left side is all blocked.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:26.400
If there are imbalances in you,
like you are too much emotional,

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:33.520
then you’ll go more towards this [left]
side, and this side is very, very vulnerable.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.000
And once you start going
too much on that side,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.320
there are areas built within you which
are called as Collective Subconscious.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:44.720
The other day, as I told you,
that cancer is caused by the attack

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:51.760
of proteins – which are called as
Protein 58 and all that,

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:56.880
because the scientists don’t know
what they are – they come from this area.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.560
They say it comes from the areas –
I mean, the doctors are honest,

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:02.560
because whatever they know,
that’s what they say –

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:09.280
it comes from the areas which are
built within us since our creation.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.360
We call it as Collective Subconscious.

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:15.680
We know all about it because you will,
yourself, see when you get your realization,

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:20.000
that all these things are there
and they attack.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.800
This left-sided attack gives you
a thing like cancer

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:30.720
and many other troubles like mental
problems and schizophrenia

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.400
and all such things.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:37.680
Right side movement too much, where
these are all the psyche people

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:42.320
like Mr. Freud, who was really
half-baked and a funny person,

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:52.480
who said that you should not allow
any conditioning upon yourself

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.680
and do as you like.
He didn’t know that there is

00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:02.800
another power within us.
If you try to do as you like,

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:08.800
then what happens?
You start living a life of an Ego,

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.160
where the whole life becomes
an ego-oriented life.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.320
You do not accept any conditioning,
nothing.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:18.720
"I’ll do as I like, I’ll live as I like;
I’m a free person."

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:22.720
Free doesn’t mean license,
so I have a license to do what I like –

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.680
I am a free person,
I can do what I like with myself."

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.880
And then you start leading
a life of Ego.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:34.640
If you have this left-side problem,
then the problems attack you

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.560
in the sense that you feel depressed,
you feel very unhappy,

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:43.920
you feel as if the whole world
is going to be collapsing on you,

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:50.000
and you are extremely receded from life.
You become recluses with this left side.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.680
But with the right-side,
you are riding a very fast horse,

00:25:54.240 --> 00:26:00.400
we have to say in a way that the people
who are, say, very dominating type –

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.760
Hitler is the extreme of that,
you can say.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.120
But now, Mr. Hitler, if you went
and told him that, "You suffer from ego,"

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.880
he would have killed you;
he can’t bear that.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:16.400
And this kind of a thing, when it comes
in you, this ego-orientation,

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:21.760
is more dangerous, because you harm
others and you are not aware of it.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:27.360
So both the things are harmful to you.
You have to lead a life of a balance,

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.800
in the centre.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.560
This balance, if you achieve
by using these two powers,

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:39.600
like the brake and the accelerator
within you, you develop that balance,

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:45.520
and [when] that balance is achieved,
then you lead a very simple, balanced life.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:50.000
But, as I said, if somebody comes and
tells you, "You have to stand on your head,"

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.600
you’ll go on standing on your head.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:55.840
If they say, "You must have so much
of waistline, so much of this thing,"

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.840
they will be jogging throughout.

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:01.840
If anything you tell them, they will go
to such an extreme end

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:06.560
that either they’ll jump onto
the right side or to the left side.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:11.600
When you go to the left side,
the experience can be like you might feel

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:15.280
that you are seeing things
from somewhere,

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:19.040
or you might feel that you are jumping
in your bed.

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:22.560
The other day, I met a man who said
that, in his dream,

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:26.080
he saw somebody coming and piercing
into his forehead,

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.720
and since then he’s sort of immobilized.

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:32.800
All sorts of experiences you can get
if you go to the left-hand side.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:37.040
Some of the drugs can take you
to the left and some take you to the right.

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:41.600
LSD takes you to the right,
by which you start seeing things

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:46.640
like you see colours and things –
you go to the Supra-conscious area.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:50.880
The Supra-conscious area is more
dangerous, in a way, to the seekers

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:57.840
than the other side, because –
like you get Supra-conscious people

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.720
who start seeing something written
on the wall,

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:05.760
they start getting things in their hand,
they start prophesying

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:10.960
and all sorts of things they do.
All such people think they have become God.

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.720
This is a very dangerous situation.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:16.400
They always think that because
actually they are held by some busybodies

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:21.120
who are making them evil.
These are actually the busybodies.

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:26.880
We have one very good example
of Dr Lak in England;

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.440
he died, but a very ambitious man.

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:34.720
And he could not complete his thesis,
what he wanted to do about surgery.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:41.040
So his spirit entered into a soldier
who was fighting in Vietnam,

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.200
and this soldier – he didn’t enter
into his own son –

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.840
he told this man that, "You go and see
my son in England

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:54.320
and you start a curative centre
of this late Mr. Lak",

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:58.960
I mean, he’s dead, "and I will help
there; you better go and see my son."

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.600
This fellow in that possessed state,
went to the son

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.120
and the son said, "Alright, how am I
to believe that you are my father,

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.360
that my father is haunting you?"

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:11.040
He said, "I will tell you so many things
that we did together secretly."

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.600
And he was amazed. He said, "Alright,
let’s start the thing."

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:17.120
And they have got this kind
of an institute where,

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:19.840
if you are suffering from some disease
or something,

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.840
you have to write to that institute.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:26.080
What they do, they will tell you,
"At 5 o’clock, on such and such date," –

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:30.000
they are honest, I should say –
"we’ll enter into your body and cure you."

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.720
They will cure one disease but,
because of this extreme push this side,

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.920
you are again pushed back on the other
side, rebounded –

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:41.200
and you may develop a horrible
nervous system.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.000
You might become lunatic,
you might become mad.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.880
People who have been his patients
are worse patients now,

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.440
and I have been treating them in India,
many of them.

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:55.760
So, such organizations exist
and they start telling you

00:29:55.760 --> 00:30:00.480
about many things like, "Oh, if you
go this side, this will happen."

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:05.360
I mean, it’s a very subtle behaviour
of these horrible people,

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:10.480
these busybodies,
and they really try to spoil you.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:15.040
Now, many of the gurus who come here –
these so-called gurus –

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:19.840
either work on this side or that side,
or sometimes both sides.

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:23.440
They use the spirits to mesmerize you,
first of all.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.840
They will use any spirit to introduce
in this centre, for example –

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:33.920
an Antichrist will touch this one.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:38.400
And I know of somebody who is here –
an absolute Antichrist;

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.600
he touches this centre,
and creates problems in you

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:47.680
and produces within you a symptom
just like blood cancer.

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.320
There’s another one who wants
to teach you how to fly –

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:55.040
he gives you epilepsy,
simple thing like epilepsy.

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:58.400
There is another one who gives
you cancer; there’s a third one

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:03.280
who gives you a heart attack –
they are experts on giving you diseases;

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:06.720
all one better than the other
and in the long run,

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:10.560
you find all your money is lost,
you are lost,

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:12.960
there’s nothing left with you
[and] you are a recluse.

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.720
There’s somebody who has made
his disciples so funny

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:20.320
that they are even afraid
of the vegetable, like a garlic –

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.000
you show them the garlic,
they’ll run away.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.520
If you show them a lemon,
they’ll run away.

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:29.200
These people have worked on you
because you are naïve.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.800
First of all, you have money.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:33.120
They have no interest in the poor people
of India.

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:38.160
They have no interest in looking
after people who understand them.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:42.880
They have only interest in you
who are naïve, who are simple people,

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:50.720
who have money and, best of all,
you are that category which is the seekers.

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:55.280
You are born specially to seek your Self;
you are a special category.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:01.040
Everybody’s not like that.
In this place, New York,

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:08.960
there may be many seekers, I agree.
But this category is not with everyone.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:13.720
There are few human beings,
relatively to its population,

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:18.720
who are really seekers, and these
special categories have to become prophets

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:20.720
and they have to make others prophets.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:24.080
It was prophesied by a great poet
like William Blake.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.400
We should read all these things
and understand that,

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.600
even Sahaja Yoga, has been prophesied
in the Bible.

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.880
In all the Puranas, in all the books,
it is prophesied that,

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.200
in these modern times,
this is going to happen:

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:41.440
that thousands of people, who have been
searching God in their previous lives,

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:45.440
are going to receive their blessings
and they are going to become that.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.480
Under these promises you start
going to these people,

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.600
but they cannot cure you
because they are not authorized.

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.600
They are not here to give you
realization.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:58.240
They are here to make their money.
They are parasites,

00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.680
they’re absolute parasites.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:02.720
Say, now today as he said,
my husband is well placed,

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.520
maybe he might come from a rich family
or whatever it is.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.920
I don’t have to depend on you
or anyone.

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:16.000
But, supposing I was like Christ,
a carpenter’s daughter.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.040
So, I would have lived like that;
it makes no difference

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.960
whether you are rich or poor.

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:28.000
To me, comfort has no meaning:
I can sleep here, I can sleep anywhere.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.720
Yesterday, we went to Boston
and it was a small little room

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:35.200
of a student… we were six, seven people,
we all slept together; no problem for us.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.080
In my house, I have bedrooms,
I have everything –

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:42.960
too much of a comfort –
and it falls upon me; I don’t like it.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:46.320
A person who is a holy person
doesn’t seek others’ money

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.000
and doesn’t live like a parasite.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.960
For example, you see yourself,
if I tell you, "I give you money

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.840
for your living," will you accept,
anyone of you?

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.920
And these people are doing nothing
for their living;

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.480
they are living on your money,
they are having Rolls Royces

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:05.280
and this and that.
A saint has no interest in these points.

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:09.440
Like, one of them who is nowadays here,
who has now become a Yankee, they say,

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:16.560
he told to English people, he wrote to
them that, "If you want me to come there" –

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:19.440
they’re all mad after him!
They said they have got knowledge.

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.320
What sort of a knowledge,
one only knows.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:25.680
That, "If I am coming to England,
you have to give me a Rolls Royce."

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:29.760
The poor boys, in England –
as it is, people are not so rich.

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.960
Young people don’t have so much money –
and they starved themselves,

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:38.360
ate potatoes, did this and that,
and they created a fifty-ninth Rolls Royce –

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:41.680
I mean, he has already fifty-eight –
this fifty-ninth was created

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:44.720
and this fellow very nicely came
to receive the Rolls Royce.

00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.480
You ask them,
"What has he given you?"

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.870
"He has given us knowledge,
we are in knowledge."

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:52.080
They look just like possessed people
they are moving

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.520
and they are going down.

00:34:53.520 --> 00:35:00.960
Those people who come from that area
have mostly blood cancer.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:05.120
And they just live
as if they are not living.

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.160
It’s such a horrible thing.
What knowledge have they got?

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:11.520
If you have knowledge, you should know
what’s happening in another person,

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:14.880
you should get collectively conscious,
you should become,

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.280
it’s actualization
and it should happen to you.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.680
You should feel that,
as you have shown here,

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:24.480
that all these centres
you can feel on your fingers.

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:28.080
You should feel your own centres
and you should feel the centres of others.

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.320
You should become that.

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:34.160
If you are satisfied with what you have
done, and what wrongs you have done,

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:37.680
we cannot cure you.
You have to know that you have not found it

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:42.240
and you have to get to it,
in all honesty and sincerity.

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.640
And throw away all that is nonsensical.

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.600
Then only it works out and this has
to happen to you,

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:50.000
that you start feeling
all these centres here.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.600
Now see, you can see the colours
that are given separately onto this.

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.280
Now, for example,
this is the left hand

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:59.760
and left hand means
the left side of this one.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:05.280
Now this one, if it is catching –
if you feel heat, if you feel any catching,

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:09.360
if you feel that there’s burning
in this finger, in this thumb of left hand –

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:13.120
this is all left side, is the psyche;
means somebody has tried

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:17.840
to disturb your psyche
in an unauthorized way.

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:21.680
Most of the gurus have this.

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:25.760
All the left side can be caught up
by them, but specially this one is the sign

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:30.800
that you have been to somebody
who has been unauthorized, anyone.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.000
You can go to a spiritualist,
is a most dangerous game

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.200
to have a spiritualist.

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.760
I was surprised, somebody told me,
"Mother, You are going to America.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:44.160
Now they have started witchcraft also.
[UNCLEAR]. It’s magic."

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:47.280
They told me, "It’s much worse now.
It was better ten years back;

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:50.880
now it’s witchcraft. You’ll be facing
people who have been doing witchcraft,

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:58.400
they are doing all openly."
And they warned me that,

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:03.040
"Maybe you may not be able to do
anything there", but I don’t think so;

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:06.560
it’s much better than I expected
and I’m very happy about it.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:11.520
So, this is what happens to you, is that,
when you start doing something like that,

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:13.040
you start showing here.

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:20.960
Now, this one is this side,
left side of this very important centre.

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:27.520
This one shows that you are guilty,
you feel guilty; you are diffident.

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:32.240
When the Spirit approaches this point,
it makes you all the time feel guilty;

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:35.760
you feel guilty for everything.
What is there to feel guilty?

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:40.160
I mean, you have not murdered anyone;
real murderer will never feel guilty,

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:42.480
but the one who has done nothing
all the time starts saying,

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.680
"Oh, I should not have said this,
I should not have done this,

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.680
I should not have gone there."

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:52.480
All these feelings come to you
from Left Vishuddhi.

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:55.680
It can be from the kind of training
you have had.

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:58.480
For example, mostly I have seen
Catholics because they have to go

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:02.880
and confess. Even if they have done
no sins, they have to go and confess

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.920
because the priest must have his
existence, somehow.

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:10.080
This kind of a thing, if you have that,
you have to go and confess

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:12.560
some sort of a sin.
You may even coin [some] of your own,

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:16.640
because you don’t know what to talk
to him if you have not committed any sins.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:21.120
So all these things are settled down.
You must know, all the sins

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:25.440
and all the blasphemy, everything that
you have done is going to be forgiven,

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.520
has to be forgiven.

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:30.240
If it is going to be
en-masse realization,

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:34.720
all these things have to be forgiven.
It’s written;

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:36.880
I was reading the other day
Pilgrim’s Progress

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:43.440
and he has said that all these things
will be forgiven. Is promised.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:47.280
And what sin can you commit?
What guilt can you have?

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:52.560
If God is ocean of forgiveness and love,
what can you do?

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:56.880
He is going to cleanse you.
He is going to bless you. He has to do.

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:59.200
So what’s the use of feeling guilty
all the time?

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:02.480
But that doesn’t mean you should feel
arrogant on the other side.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.800
This side you’ll feel guilty
and the right side,

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:11.280
if you have a catch on the right side,
that means you have been very aggressive.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.920
Or you may be suffering from
[UNCLEAR cold] or all these things;

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:19.200
these are suggestive of physical side.
The right side is for physical and mental side.

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.280
All these things you can verify gradually.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:25.840
I would suggest that you should get your
realization first; first thing first.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:28.960
Let’s open your eyes; let’s you have
the light within yourself

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:34.000
and see for yourself how it works,
alright? Should we have that?

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.840
And also we’ll have some questions.

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:56.880
They’re already feeling it.
You are feeling guilty now.

00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:02.160
Yes, that’s true,
you are already feeling it.

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:05.360
This is a very common disease
in the West, to feel guilty,

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:10.960
it’s a very common disease.
We Indians never feel guilty, you know?

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:18.000
They have other things but not this,
thank God.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:26.800
They have many other problems,
terrible ones, unbelievable…

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:48.960
As I was telling you, we don’t know
how to advertise;

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:52.480
we’ve done our level best
but people don’t come to reality.

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:59.040
You have one mesmerizer here.
All of them stayed for this [UNCLEAR].

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:02.720
We tried everything, I don’t know
how to reach to the seekers;

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.320
I don’t know what they are seeking.

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:11.520
They want all the circus –
I don’t know what they want. Hmm.

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:12.480
So, any questions?

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:27.040
Yesterday I told you about Christ,
isn’t it? When He is awakened,

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:30.800
I told you that.
You were there for the lecture?

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:36.080
When He’s awakened here, that the Ego
and Superego are sucked in.

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:39.920
That is what is promised,
that He is the one who sucks

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:51.360
Ego and Superego,
but He’s to be awakened.

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:53.680
First thing that happens,
when Kundalini rises,

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:57.440
that you find there is no thought
in your mind.

00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:00.800
There’s no thought,
you have become blank, first thing.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:05.120
Then when it pierces through,
you start feeling the cool breeze.

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:11.200
It’s so simple, he can’t believe it.
You don’t know,

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:15.360
there was a gentleman who came to me,
he’s an actor in London.

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:17.920
He came in a program,
and when he got it, he laughed

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.720
and he couldn’t bear it. He said,
"Mother, I will go out and laugh now,

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.880
aloud." He went around and laughed.

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.320
I said, "But why did you laugh so much?"

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:27.760
He said, "I did all kinds of acrobats.
That’s why I was laughing.

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:33.520
It’s so simple." Imagine. People have
written books after books

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:41.840
and so much of nonsense they have done,
I tell you. You can’t imagine. All trash.

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:45.040
Are you alright now, better?

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:50.400
Now you go on saying,
"I’m not guilty" in your heart.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:58.240
Put your right hand on your heart.
Yes, now… again, say it thrice.

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:16.080
alright? We’ll work it out, but you just
say, "I’m not guilty."

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:21.280
You have put your own load here.
Better now, see. Remove it.

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:28.880
Ah, I’m not guilty.
In my heart, I try and it hurts,

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:31.200
but I feel a heat here.

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.920
It is little there, but it’s better now,
gradually.

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:38.080
How many years you have been
feeling guilty?

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:40.880
About a year.

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.800
It will work out.

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:49.040
You say, the realization –
is it a connection that you want us

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:52.960
to achieve or to understand,
between the Spiritual…

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:54.637
in other words, the connection
of the Spirit?

00:43:54.637 --> 00:43:58.480
Of course, of course,
it’s the breaking through; you become that.

00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:03.120
It’s the connection you have established.
Like, every instrument has a connecting line,

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:04.800
isn’t it? You have to connect it
to the mains –

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:06.800
you are just to be connected
to the mains.

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:11.680
That is fantastic. For example,
you have a camera or say,

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:14.400
you have a television
or something like that.

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:18.880
If you connect it to the mains,
it starts showing its fantastic things.

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:22.680
You are like that. Nothing so fantastic.
You are fantastic,

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:25.680
but you have no self-esteem.

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:28.240
I don’t understand, human beings
have no self-esteem.

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:32.320
I mean, they are top of all the evolution,
they are higher than all the animals.

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:35.360
Now they are learning the behaviour
from animals.

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:39.360
We have nothing to learn from them.
Have we to learn anything from them?

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.200
God has placed us so much above.

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:42.000
Yes, my child?

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:48.240
Why are we separated from the Spirit
and are we at birth?

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:54.720
We are separated because of ignorance.
We started becoming from amoebic stage

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:59.600
to human stage, developing our
awareness better and better and better.

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:04.000
Like a reflector we are,
so the reflector is improving gradually

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.320
and the reflection of that spiritual life
shows better and better

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:10.000
till we reach a human stage.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.080
Now, here we come at this stage
in the process, of the living process,

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:20.560
and then we become connected,
and that ignorance is finished.

00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:23.440
We are not separated as such,
we are looked after.

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:28.240
Like, there is darkness in this room,
but you are not separated from light.

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:32.240
Only you have to switch on.

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:38.400
There is no punishment or anything
done to you, no,

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:42.400
because you have come from that.
Your awareness has started improving.

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:50.800
You keep talking about the living process.
This can happen while you’re alive,

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.520
it doesn’t happen when you die?

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:58.000
No, not. You have to live,
you have to have a body;

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.960
if you don’t have a body,
this realization doesn’t take place.

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:05.200
So some people talk of the dead gurus
and all that, it’s not possible.

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:08.560
You have to get it when you are living;
you have to have the body.

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:13.520
Body is the temple as you can say,
that if there is no bulb,

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.120
you cannot get light.
There may be light

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:17.440
but you have to have a bulb.

00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:23.120
It has to come in the form
of a human being, not in the animals.

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:33.680
You mentioned here that you are
the link of Self realization.

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:39.360
So are we, or the people who get
Self-realization here,

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:43.760
getting their Self-realization
through you or…

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:46.400
No, no, no – your Self.
Did they say I am the link?

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:49.040
He should not have said that.

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:56.640
It means that I am the one who enlightens,
that’s all. I am, as one light…

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.880
you can enlighten also.

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:02.160
It should not have said that,
it’s dangerous to say such a thing.

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:05.280
because if it says, everybody’s ego
comes up like that, "Oh, what she is,

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:10.480
who is she?" You see everywhere,
mostly I have seen in Europe, specially,

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:14.000
they said, "Why you?" I said,
"You do it; I’ll be very happy.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000
I am a happily married woman.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.360
I have a very good husband,
my children and grandchildren.

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:24.560
I have to do it, day in and day out.

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:27.760
If you can do it, nothing like it.
I will retire."

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:32.560
If you can do it, nothing like it.
To travel like this, work it out,

00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:34.960
spend your own money, do it.

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:39.920
It’s not [UNCLEAR] I must be
something special, no doubt,

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:42.880
but that you find out later on,
not just now.

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:47.600
I have to be something special to do it,
but that you’ll find out later on.

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:50.960
You should not have put it in there,
because half of the Americans

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.520
would not come if they say there is
somebody who is a link,

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.840
because they all think they are
already realized souls,

00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.840
great people dropping from Heaven.

00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:02.080
This is also another kind of a selfesteem.

00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:08.000
Well, do you just have to want it or…
how do you get it?

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:12.160
I think we’ll discover it later on,
because I never got it;

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.680
I had it, that’s the problem.

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:18.080
No, she’s asking, does she just
have to want it, herself?

00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:21.520
Does one have to want it or does one
just all of a sudden… be it?

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:25.200
There is one thing that
it cannot be forced.

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:29.040
Your freedom is respected.
Now you are free.

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:34.880
If the egg wants to be bird or not,
you don’t ask the egg; you don’t ask,

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:40.720
because it’s the animal stage.
But in human stage, you have to ask for it.

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:42.880
If you do not ask, you do not get it.

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:44.640
Nobody’s going to force on you.

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:48.640
Neither the Divine is going to fall
at your feet that you ask, no.

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:52.640
On the contrary, you have to humble down
to ask for it.

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:55.280
It cannot go to arrogant people.

00:48:55.280 --> 00:49:00.960
You have to ask for it, in a way.
If it works, thank your stars.

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:04.080
If it doesn’t work,
we’ll work it out later on,

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:07.920
but you have to ask for it, no doubt.
It’s such a great thing.

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:14.000
Only that much you have to do,
not pay for it but ask for it,

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.240
in a humble way.

00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:16.960
Yes?

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:20.800
Something disturbs me about the movement –
not yours, I’m just saying that

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:24.560
you mentioned before that there are so
many seekers in the United States

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:28.000
and [UNCLEAR elsewhere]. I find it very
disturbing to find these people

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:33.440
are seeking divinity or spirituality,
and yet they themselves are not

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:37.600
in a state of purification
or do not live in a pure state.

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.800
I don’t see how the two can reconcile
each other. I mean, I think

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.440
before you realize this realization,
this connection…

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:48.400
You must go into a cleaning process,
you mean?

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:54.000
Yes, exactly, and really to have these
desires that are vulgar and so forth,

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.440
fall away from you… and yet they…

00:49:56.440 --> 00:50:00.960
No, this was done before,
and it’s a very slow process

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:03.440
which was worked out,
that you try to cleanse yourself,

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:07.200
but it’s not possible unless and until
there’s a realized guru

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:10.800
who looks after you, each individual,
and all that.

00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:14.800
Now, the Grace has decided that,
first of all,

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:18.960
let us start all the machinery,
all the cars you can say,

00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:21.520
second-hand, third-hand, fifth-hand.

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:28.320
Let us start; see how far they can go,
then try to correct.

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:32.800
Unless and until you get out of your car,
also you do not know what’s wrong with it.

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:37.440
So, unless and until you get
your realization, really you cannot know.

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:42.160
For example now, I’m an old,
ancient guru of olden times, take it like that.

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:47.120
Now, you come to me.
First of all, these gurus used to test you.

00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:51.760
They would break you, stand on your head,
sit on your legs and do all kinds of things,

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:58.000
because they would take only one person,
one person among millions,

00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.840
and see that if they could work it out.

00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:03.680
And they would really work on him
and make him do all those things.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.840
The trouble is, in modern times,
if you tell anybody to do something,

00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:15.680
they’ll do just the opposite.
It’s a very difficult situation.

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:18.240
Now think for a moment this point of view:

00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:21.760
I want you to have your realization
because I can’t enjoy it myself.

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:22.680
You have to have your realization.

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:25.280
I can see that diamond in you;
I want you to have it.

00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:27.360
So what would Mother do?

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:30.160
If she has to do something,
she’ll go round and say,

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:31.920
"Alright, let’s have it."

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:34.640
First you have it and see if you like it or not.

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:37.760
Supposing I have cooked the food
and you say, "No, I don’t want to have it."

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:42.080
What will I do? "Alright, taste a little bit,
see how it is."

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:44.120
Once you jump into it, for these people
have got it.

00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:48.560
Now he’s got realization,
he knows the taste of it.

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:52.400
Not only that, but without realization,
you can’t judge yourself.

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:55.760
If I judge you, I say now,
supposing I say, "Warren,

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:59.040
you have lots of ego." When he came
to me, he was ego like a balloon,

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:02.320
like this, you won’t believe.
But if I tell him that,

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:07.840
he would have punched me immediately,
isn’t it? Now you agree then?

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.520
But this fellow, I didn’t say to him,
"You have ego," or anything.

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:15.360
"Alright," I said, "We give him realization,"
then he came down on it.

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:19.840
Then I put him into proper state,
raised his Kundalini.

00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:24.560
Then he started seeing his ego. He said,
"Oh, God, such an ego I have, Mother.

00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:27.840
Now what to do with it?"
I said, "I’ll tell you how to reduce it."

00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:31.520
So, unless and until you have the eyes,
you can’t see, and if you tell them,

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:36.160
"Don’t do it," he will do it.
Best thing is to give the eyes first to you.

00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:39.920
You may not see it so clearly
but you’ll start seeing it.

00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:42.800
Then you’ll start improving yourself.
You’ll judge yourself.

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:46.000
You better judge yourself.
It’s much better than I judge you.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.880
Then you correct yourself
because you can’t just bear it.

00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:51.440
Yesterday there was a lady,
she was suffering from liver –

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:55.840
she has not come today – and she told me,
"Mother, after realization I got a headache."

00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:59.040
I said, "You have a liver?
Otherwise you would not attend to it,

00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:01.200
but now you have got a headache,
you’d better attend to it."

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:07.840
So I told her how to look after it;
within two days, she’s alright, she’s cured.

00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:11.040
People become mad and they don’t know
they are possessed,

00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:15.760
till they absolutely land up
in the lunatic asylum.

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:21.280
To give them judgment power
is very important.

00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:24.960
And how will you make out when he’s
a real guru or not a real guru?

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:28.880
Even logically you can, but otherwise,
how will you make out? Very simple.

00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:32.960
You just seek [UNCLEAR the light].

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:38.320
So, you must get your discrimination
power, but actually while getting it,

00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:42.160
you really become the master.
That’s the simple thing.

00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:46.400
Now, he has been with me only
for eighteen weeks or maybe eighteen months?

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:48.560
Eighteen months only;
now he is a master.

00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:52.240
He has established seven centres
in seven cities in Australia

00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:56.160
and he’s come to America, I mean,
imported him for you people.

00:53:56.160 --> 00:54:00.560
But now, you’d better go
and look after other people.

00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:03.360
What’s the question?

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.760
You were talking about the Spirit
being in the Heart chakra there,

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:13.520
over on the left side. I’d like to know
why it’s on the left instead of in the middle,

00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:16.320
because if the Spirit – it has to do
with realization –

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:20.480
why isn’t it in the middle in the central
Kundalini, instead of on the other side

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:24.869
like that, and why is it…
and why in…the heart, yeah.

00:54:24.869 --> 00:54:29.280
The heart. Heart is the main thing
within us, that’s the last.

00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:34.640
Once heart stops, we don’t exist:
sheer existence.

00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:39.120
That’s the most important organ
that God has given us.

00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:47.280
Once the Spirit is angry, in any way
strained, any way despaired,

00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:51.920
we just exist, and then we die.
There’s nothing left.

00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:56.400
Heart is very important. That’s why
He’s placed there, in human beings,

00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:59.600
but it comes out, comes out also.

00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:05.760
It can come out and see,
go around and see. But the seat is there.

00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:08.720
When you will start growing
into Sahaja Yoga,

00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:13.040
you will start seeing how this Spirit
manifests and how it grows.

00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:16.320
It sits on the seat also.

00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:17.600
What does it look like?

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:22.080
It is now in the heart,
but then it comes on the seat,

00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:24.720
at a point, that’s much different,
that’s much later.

00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:25.280
I see.

00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:30.800
Alright? So it has to be brought there;
first a seat has to be created properly.

00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:34.640
Just now, heart is the one,
[UNCLEAR it lies just there],

00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:41.920
it doesn’t… it is not according to our will,
it is His will that is important.

00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:46.480
We have to please His whims also.

00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:50.480
Would You say conscience and soul is …
resides in the heart area?

00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:51.520
What is it?

00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:54.640
Conscience; in other words, people –
their guilt feelings

00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:58.760
or their realization of what’s right
and wrong – resides in the heart feeling,

00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:00.473
it comes from the heart area?
This knowledge…?

00:56:00.473 --> 00:56:03.840
It’s not that, it doesn’t come;
it comes from the Left side, as I showed you.

00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:08.720
But heart area is the one
where resides the Spirit, actually.

00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:09.920
So the soul would be…?

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:16.160
Soul… and the soul is a wider thing
than Spirit is.

00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:25.920
Because when one dies, only the element,
that is the Earth element, dies

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:30.560
and the water element also
starts oozing out.

00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:35.520
But whatever remains are the three
elements, which are the three auras,

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:38.080
plus the Spirit is the source.

00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:40.480
And the Kundalini also resides on that.

00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:47.040
After realization, you can see that,
you can see so many Kundalinis floating –

00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:51.760
they have all seen it.
You’ll see it, it’s fantastic.

00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:53.600
You are all fantastic people.

00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:55.200
That’s not the aura necessarily?

00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:58.880
No, no, no, no, no – auras are right side;
Supra-conscious.

00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:03.600
But you actually see these Kundalinis
floating around – I’ll show you.

00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:12.480
So what do you say, now?

00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:17.520
How do we do this for ourselves?
How do we do this for our Self?

00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:20.560
Now, that’s the point; we are coming
to that point now.

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:35.440
We should not have put ‘missing link’
on the poster].

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:37.040
Did you put ‘missing link’ or what?

00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:37.432
No, no, no…

00:57:37.432 --> 00:57:40.160
No, no, no, no, no – don’t say all that.

00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:40.720
Not the missing link.

00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:43.040
A bit too much.

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:48.240
If it offends you, get your realization first…

00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:58.080
Not offends, but it offends everyone
because we should learn

00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:05.040
from our experiences; Christ said nothing
except that He said, "I am the Son of God,"

00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:11.040
and they crucified Him.
One has to be careful.

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:15.600
If you say anything like that,
people don’t like it. Better not say.

00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:22.000
Tell them I am just like you, blind –
little of my eyes are open,

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.360
then they’ll be happy.
It was very wrong to say that.

00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:32.800
I didn’t see that, I would have told them.
I am anxious not to say.

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:36.560
It seems to imply that we’re getting
your realization,

00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:42.240
the realization through you–
that you are the link to the Eternal.

00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:45.822
But why will you have objection to that?

00:58:45.822 --> 00:58:48.720
I beg your pardon?
Will you have objection if it is so?

00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:55.520
Well, it would be your realization
that we are tasting,

00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:57.280
because you would be the link if…

00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:00.080
But supposing I am the link.
Supposing I am the link, supposing.

00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:07.272
Take a supposition – then what’s happening?
What is the harm?

00:59:07.272 --> 00:59:10.320
What do you mean, "No harm"?
But there’s a price for everything.

00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:15.920
No, no – should not; because you must
know that unconscious can’t talk to you.

00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:19.360
Somebody has to come and talk to you,
somebody has to decode,

00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:21.280
somebody had to tell you.

00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:24.400
It’s not easy to become human being.
You know it’s very difficult

00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:29.760
for the Divine to become this.
Absolutely, it’s such a hazardous thing

00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:33.440
to become a human being,
because they are so absurd, so stupid,

00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:40.400
and you don’t know what to do with them.
It’s a very difficult task.

00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:45.520
I’m shocked sometimes – how can they
do it? I mean, I just can’t understand.

00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:47.120
What’s that, that end part of it?

00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:51.115
For the Divine to become a human being,
she’s saying; for the Divine to become…

00:59:51.115 --> 00:59:56.480
Is a very difficult thing.
Divine to be Divine is the easiest thing,

00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:01.520
but to become a human being,
to talk to them, to look after them…

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:07.520
Supposing if I am Divine.
If you insult me, you’ll be hurt

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:11.040
and that I wouldn’t like
because I am compassion.

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:15.840
Like Christ said, "Forgive them,
for they do not know what they are doing."

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:21.120
For the Jews He said so, for the Jews.
"For they do not know what they are doing,"

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:23.600
because He was frightened.
They are crucifying Him

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:26.120
and He was frightened for the people
because He was compassion.

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:32.560
So, it’s a very difficult situation,
very sensitive.

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:36.640
But you should not have put that,
I tell you, it was a mistake.

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:39.440
I never saw that.
It’s a good pointing out.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:44.160
I know it, people won’t like it.
They won’t like it.

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:48.000
I think our second one is a better one.
Who did that?

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:51.120
It was done for the Australian tour,
Mother.

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:53.920
Ah, Australians are very different
from Americans.

01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.320
You should never have done for Americans –
no, no, no, no.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:03.120
Australians are very different people,
because they were punished

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:08.960
once upon a time, their forefathers.
So they do not have ego trips much,

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:14.320
they do not have. They want a redeemer,
they are a very different type of people.

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:19.840
Americans think they are the redeemers
of the whole world.

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:21.920
They are responsible for everything.

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:26.400
This is a very different land;
you should have never done that.

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:30.080
Yes, it’s a very common thing.
Americans really think

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:32.880
they are going to redeem the whole world.

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:36.400
And all the Antichrists are coming
and settling down with them.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:41.280
All the Antichrists are, as a result,
and it’s such a dangerous situation

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:44.160
that I just pray that they would have
more sense to understand

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:46.880
these are Antichrists – throw them away!

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:50.320
Could You explain what You mean by
the manifestation;

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:53.760
how do you see an Antichrist?
What does he manifest as?

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:56.640
He’s a devil, he’s a Satan.

01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:01.840
You know why … I’m very, I mean,
as a person it wouldn’t affect me,

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:05.680
it wouldn’t bother me. If I see something
as, what you call evil,

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:08.080
I don’t consider things being evil
per se but …

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:10.240
For this I would just say you get
your realization,

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:13.680
then you will know how much it bothers
you, because you don’t see, that’s the thing.

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:15.832
If you don’t see a snake, how will you know
how it attacks you?

01:02:15.832 --> 01:02:20.720
Yeah, I know but I mean, as a person that
doesn’t like whatever is unrealized?

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:27.579
and stuff – you reject it.
Why is it so effective as a …

01:02:27.579 --> 01:02:27.600
harmful adversary …

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:36.560
Because it kills all your chances
of realization, first and foremost.

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:39.120
I don’t mind if they are thugs,
they take away money from you,

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:42.160
make you poor, do what they like;
I don’t mind all that.

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:46.080
Let them be parasites, do anything;
there are so many people like that, isn’t it?

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:53.120
There are so many beggars,
there are so many thieves

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:56.960
and there are murderers, every sort.
I don’t mind anything of that kind.

01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:01.040
But because they spoil your Kundalini,
that’s why I have all the objection.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:03.680
You have to have your realization,
that’s your right.

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:06.640
And then do you shrug it off, I mean,
does it affect you if you are …

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:07.520
if you have…

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:10.720
No, no, not like that – that’s not true.

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:15.440
No, you shrug off – she’s asking do you
shrug off your … all the negativity?

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:17.669
Yeah, the negativity,
that’s what I mean.

01:03:17.669 --> 01:03:17.680
Who shrugs?

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:23.040
She’s asking does one, when they get
their realization, shrug off the negativity?

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:25.872
After realization? Oh, they just run away.

01:03:25.872 --> 01:03:29.838
So I’m saying that, when you see this,
you just … that’s why I …

01:03:29.838 --> 01:03:30.720
I mean people… even before they have
realization …

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:36.240
That a person who is not a realized soul,
according to me, is not yet really a person.

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:41.760
That’s what I’m trying to tell you,
that you are not yet fully that.

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:45.920
You have to become that.
Now the gentleman is getting very, very …

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:46.560
Impatient?

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:51.440
And that should be so because – now,
let us not too much go into mental activity

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.160
because what will happen, you may not
get your realization

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:57.600
because of mental activities
and this centre goes out a little bit.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:01.440
So, let us stop at this point.
Let’s have it now.

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:04.480
You have to take out your shoes.
I’m sorry, because that helps

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.560
the Mother Earth to take away
all our problems.

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:09.760
We must get our realization at any cost;
that’s the main thing.

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:16.240
My only thing is that you must get
your realization. What’s that?

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.920
Just a tape recorder.

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:27.840
He’s taping it? Could be dangerous.

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:31.840
We don’t allow them to tape;
it was the taping that started a lot of

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:37.840
organizations this time.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:40.040
Would you mind if it …

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:42.480
No, it’s turned off. OK.

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:47.520
Alright? If you want to have tapes,
you can have from these people;

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:52.160
they have got some tapes of my speeches,
but normally we don’t allow people to tape.

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:56.640
Because last time, this experience was
so horrifying that this time we have

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:59.840
decided not to allow people who are
not Sahaja yogis to tape.

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:02.720
But if you want to have tapes,
you can have from these people.

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:10.400
Now, it’s all on the left hand,
it’s working out, it’s alright.

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:16.000
Now, let’s have your hands towards me
and close your eyes.

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:31.120
Put both the feet on the ground.

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:41.600
Both the hands towards me
and close your eyes; don’t open your eyes,

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:47.280
because when the Kundalini rushes
through this centre of Agnya,

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:52.080
then there is dilation of the pupils
and, if you keep your eyes open,

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:56.400
it won’t come up. Close your eyes.

01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:05.120
This happening takes place
and your attention is drawn inside.

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:30.800
Put your right hand on your heart.
Close your eyes.

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:36.800
Ask a question to me,
"Mother, am I the Spirit?"

01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:40.080
Mother, am I the Spirit?

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.760
Three times.

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:44.160
Mother, am I the Spirit?

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:45.440
Again.

01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:54.640
Mother, am I the Spirit?

01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:57.680
Now say, "Mother, I am not guilty."

01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:10.560
(Seekers repeat three times)

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:18.224
Now, you have to ask for realization.
Say, "Mother, please give me my realization."

01:09:18.224 --> 01:09:23.920
(Seekers repeat three times)

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:58.000
(Still a little bit left.)

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:16.880
Now please say,
"Mother, I forgive everyone."

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:20.720
Got it? Good.

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:27.280
(Seekers repeat three times)

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:36.000
Now you have to say,
"Mother, if I have neglected my Spirit,

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.840
please forgive me."

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:53.840
(Seekers repeat three times)

01:11:55.200 --> 01:12:01.280
Alright?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:25.503
That’s it, it will work out.
Keep your eyes shut.

01:12:25.503 --> 01:12:29.360
The Sahaja yogis can see now. Got it?

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:31.920
Just put your right hand …
yes, he has Mother.

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:34.000
Just put your right hand above your head.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.280
You got it. You can feel it on your head
if you have got it.

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:40.880
All the Sahaja yogis can come and see.

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:53.360
Feel ok? It’s coming out of the top
of your head? You feeling it there?

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:56.880
Those who have been to other gurus
should say, "Mother, I am my own guru."

01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:00.457
I can feel his, the same – he’s got it,
he’s got it.

01:13:00.457 --> 01:13:01.440
Yes, yes you can feel. He’s got it,
she knows.

01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:02.480
I don’t even have to feel it …

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:03.600
Are you feeling it on your hands?

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:06.800
It’s coming all out of you.

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:22.240
(laughing) Yes, Yes, he’s got it, yes.
Have you got it?

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:25.520
You didn’t say anything.
You were keeping quiet.

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:27.760
You should have said it.
You are catching on the Vishuddhi,

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:31.840
and if you had said it,
it would have opened up. Alright,

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:38.320
we’ll work it out. You should get it.
We can work it out.

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:48.240
Now are you feeling it? Slowly, slowly,
it’s a very subtle thing.

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:54.640
But in the second sitting it is better,
isn’t it? It’s more clear. It’s very clear.

01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:59.280
Oh, it’s hot, alright.
You’re alright now, are you?

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:03.360
It’s a pity they can’t turn the air
conditioning – the air conditioning’s

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:04.480
causing a lot of disturbance.

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:07.840
No, no, no – it’s alright.
You believe it, it is there.

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:13.200
yesterday, somebody who got it
thought that the window was open,

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:19.360
and then he went into the cellar to see,
and still it was there.

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:28.116
Are you alright now? Good! I’m very happy
the second sitting you got it. It’s good.

01:14:28.116 --> 01:14:29.600
So changed, so changed.
Look at this gentleman.

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:33.840
Are you alright now? See, you have got it;
second sitting, you have got it.

01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:39.200
Now, what about this gentleman –
you got it?

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:46.360
Did you feel, my child? No?
Alright, I’ll work it out.

01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:52.461
She’s feeling it in her left,
but not in her right. She thinks too much.

01:14:52.461 --> 01:14:54.760
Agnya was, too … that’s why I said
we stop it there!

01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:57.360
That should work it out. Here,
keep your eyes shut.

01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:00.800
Now, you have to forgive;
go on forgiving – "I forgive", say.

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:01.440
How easy is that?

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.480
I forgive

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:03.360
Again

01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:05.440
(seeker repeats twice)

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:19.920
I forgive everyone.
(seeker repeats, Shri Mataji is working on her –

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:20.316
Forgive, forgive, forgive.)

01:15:20.316 --> 01:15:24.640
Ah, forgiving’s not there – now forgive.

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:45.501
(Shri Mataji and the yogis continue
to work on all the seekers)
