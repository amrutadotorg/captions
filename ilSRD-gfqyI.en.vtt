00:00:08.757 --> 00:00:13.490
Today I was explaining how it happens,

00:00:15.323 --> 00:00:20.490
that how we realize

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:27.490
that God is helping us too.

00:00:30.657 --> 00:00:34.524
Any problem is an effect of some
sort of a cause, every problem.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.956
Like Mona wrote a letter that she was driving

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.577
in a motorway

00:00:45.657 --> 00:00:49.123
and the car went out of control,

00:00:49.791 --> 00:00:51.956
and the brake would not act.

00:00:53.757 --> 00:00:57.243
And there was a car coming from
the right, car coming from the left,

00:00:57.323 --> 00:01:00.677
cars going through in front and behind.

00:01:00.757 --> 00:01:03.843
And she felt that they'll be finished

00:01:03.923 --> 00:01:07.290
- two of them were traveling, two Sahaja yoginis.

00:01:08.223 --> 00:01:15.210
So the cause was the car or the brake or whatever it was,

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.577
the mechanism, and the effect was all the problem.

00:01:20.657 --> 00:01:24.956
So now, how to overcome that problem?

00:01:25.757 --> 00:01:29.344
Supposing you try to neutralize the effect, you cannot,

00:01:29.424 --> 00:01:31.843
because cause is still there.

00:01:31.923 --> 00:01:34.910
You try to improve the cause, it doesn't work out.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.629
Then what to do?

00:01:39.782 --> 00:01:44.668
One thing one has to remember:
that God Almighty has loved us,

00:01:44.748 --> 00:01:47.180
in his love he has created us.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:56.006
He loves us, he is the Father who is the last
word as far as the father’s affections are concerned.

00:01:56.086 --> 00:01:59.466
He is the greatest of greatest compassionate father

00:01:59.546 --> 00:02:04.850
who wants you to enter into his
kingdom and enjoy the bliss of his creation.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.326
He’s not created you just to
be wasted, to be frittered away,

00:02:09.406 --> 00:02:13.804
to be thrown away, to be in the hell all your lives.

00:02:13.884 --> 00:02:20.140
He has made you to respect you, to
love you and to give you what you deserve.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.709
The problem is we do not believe in
ourselves, we do not love ourselves.

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:28.540
How can we then love God who has created us?

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.823
This is the biggest problem. And when
we love ourselves we become really selfish.

00:02:32.903 --> 00:02:36.058
And when we become selfish we destroy ourselves more

00:02:36.138 --> 00:02:42.955
because that is like love-hate relationship
as that you actually hate yourself to be selfish.

00:02:43.035 --> 00:02:47.766
Because selfishness one can
never enjoy. It is a joyless pursuit.

00:02:47.846 --> 00:02:54.862
That’s why one has to understand, that first
and foremost understanding should come to us

00:02:54.942 --> 00:03:00.371
that God has created this
Universe, the whole thing for us.

00:03:00.451 --> 00:03:09.177
And he has created this beautiful
instrument within us to have our second birth

00:03:09.257 --> 00:03:18.046
to know him, to know his greatness, to know his
powers and to be the master of those powers that He has.

00:03:18.126 --> 00:03:24.692
Any father or mother is always happy
when he can give away all that he has.

00:03:24.772 --> 00:03:30.512
So this is why we do not rely
on him, we rely upon ourselves.

00:03:30.592 --> 00:03:38.209
But as long as we rely on ourselves
we live in the realm of cause and effect,

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:42.354
we cannot get out of it, we cannot jump out of it.

00:03:42.434 --> 00:03:49.798
To jump out of the realm of cause and
effect one must first of all know fully well

00:03:49.878 --> 00:03:55.624
that it is God’s love – in any
case he is going to save us,

00:03:55.704 --> 00:03:59.701
he is going to look after us,
he is going to worry about us.

00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:03.701
Believe that he exists as a living God.

00:04:03.781 --> 00:04:09.140
It is very difficult for ego-oriented
society to accept the concept

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.347
that this God is still living.
When science is there is no God.

00:04:16.974 --> 00:04:22.608
Kundalini wherever it will
go it will clean, it will nourish.

00:04:22.688 --> 00:04:29.487
This is one quality that we must understand
that it is not tarnishable, it cannot be spoiled,

00:04:29.567 --> 00:04:36.327
it cannot be ruined, moreover it cleanses, it nourishes

00:04:36.407 --> 00:04:42.628
but because it thinks, it knows
how to nourish you up to what point

00:04:42.708 --> 00:04:47.086
how to go, how far to go or it stops.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.713
But thinking is not vocal, it doesn't say anything

00:04:52.793 --> 00:04:57.673
but when it goes round these chakras it makes a sound.

00:04:57.753 --> 00:05:03.047
And these sounds are made because the movement

00:05:03.127 --> 00:05:07.088
of Kundalini through these chakras creates

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.440
a non- percussion sound pass through these

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.280
creating sounds and these sounds are then

00:05:19.087 --> 00:05:26.887
jotted down or heard by great saints and
used in the phonetic language of Sanskrit.

00:05:26.967 --> 00:05:32.968
Now, this purifying fire within
you or the purifying force within you

00:05:33.048 --> 00:05:39.581
or the power within you goes and
first of all enlightens our attention

00:05:39.661 --> 00:05:45.827
which is in this part as you see the
green part - this is the attention is.

00:05:45.907 --> 00:05:50.267
But the movement of attention
then starts moving in all directions.

00:05:50.347 --> 00:05:55.841
Now when your attention is enlightened
what we call we become collectively conscious.

00:05:55.921 --> 00:06:00.121
But still how do you go beyond
cause and effect is the point?

00:06:00.654 --> 00:06:08.854
Now, this Kundalini being pure no cause
can be attached to it - no cause, whatsoever.

00:06:08.934 --> 00:06:13.900
So, if you can enter into the
Kundalini on the principle of it

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.079
no cause can get attached to it.

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:22.722
That's how you go beyond cause and effect.

00:06:22.802 --> 00:06:28.147
But how do you enter into the
Kundalini, that's the main point?

00:06:28.227 --> 00:06:31.156
Main problem is how do we enter into the Kundalini?

00:06:31.236 --> 00:06:36.907
Supposing you are paying attention to Me
and I say pay attention to yourself, you cannot.

00:06:36.987 --> 00:06:42.487
Even if Kundalini rises your attention is
attracted inside, still you cannot pay attention inside.

00:06:42.567 --> 00:06:48.499
So how do you pay attention inside
is through this enlightened attention.

00:06:48.579 --> 00:06:52.192
This attention which is enlightened

00:06:52.272 --> 00:06:58.693
has a power to take your attention inside to the Kundalini

00:06:58.773 --> 00:07:02.860
and that's how you enter into the realm which
is detached.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.415
That like fortress. Nobody can enter in there.

00:07:06.495 --> 00:07:11.201
So, when you're in thoughtless awareness,
when you're not thinking, you are in your fortress.

00:07:11.281 --> 00:07:17.554
Nobody can jump at you, nobody
can trouble you - all the causes drop off.

00:07:17.634 --> 00:07:22.247
That is why it is necessary first to
practice to be in that thoughtless awareness

00:07:22.327 --> 00:07:25.073
through the practice of sahaja yoga to begin with.

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:30.196
So that you learn how to enter into
that state, how to enter into that state.

00:07:30.276 --> 00:07:35.206
But first and foremost thing is that
your Kundalini must be awakened,

00:07:35.286 --> 00:07:38.441
then it must be allowed to move properly.

00:07:38.521 --> 00:07:44.981
You must co-operate, you must know
how to do it and raise it so that you keep it

00:07:46.906 --> 00:07:51.946
at least if not above, at least in the brain.

00:07:52.026 --> 00:07:58.026
But best thing is if it comes out
then you have no tensions, no worries

00:07:58.106 --> 00:08:04.551
because everything that you
have passes into your attention,

00:08:04.631 --> 00:08:09.075
attention touches the Kundalini
because you are a realized soul

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:16.146
and leaves it in the force of the
Kundalini, in the current of Kundalini

00:08:16.226 --> 00:08:23.686
and this current takes away everything that
is out, and that's how you are cleared away.

00:08:23.766 --> 00:08:29.904
This is a very, very simple way of explaining
how you go beyond cause and effect.

00:08:29.984 --> 00:08:34.972
And this is what happens but for
that it is necessary that you must learn

00:08:35.052 --> 00:08:43.411
how to enter into your Kundalini,
how to keep your attention enlightened.

00:08:43.491 --> 00:08:50.425
Now it's very easy. Your attention gets
involved in to anything through your thoughts.

00:08:50.505 --> 00:08:54.106
Because when your consciousness entered into you -

00:08:54.186 --> 00:08:59.566
- being the prismatic brain - like a
prism - your attention has gone out.

00:08:59.646 --> 00:09:05.566
Now, to keep this attention detached
you have to make it a pure attention.

00:09:05.646 --> 00:09:10.826
to begin with you must try to put attention inside

00:09:10.906 --> 00:09:16.004
to be a witness, try to be a witness. But
how? How will you know that you are a witness?

00:09:16.084 --> 00:09:20.919
You have to be in thoughtless awareness.
When you are in thoughtless awareness

00:09:20.999 --> 00:09:25.106
then what happens that you're
detached, you're seeing everything.

00:09:25.186 --> 00:09:30.325
Kundalini is the only way you can go into
thoughtless awareness, your attention can go.

00:09:33.875 --> 00:09:38.333
Now for us today to decide first of all in our hearts

00:09:38.413 --> 00:09:41.417
that we’ll take to peaceful methods.

00:09:41.497 --> 00:09:45.445
When we are travelling, we’ll
be taking to peaceful methods.

00:09:45.525 --> 00:09:50.654
Anybody who is trying to provoke
you or trying to create a problem

00:09:50.734 --> 00:09:58.180
or divide you on any issue whatsoever,
run away from that person as fast as possible.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:04.899
Anybody who talks of peace, the
peace- makers, stick on to that person -

00:10:05.401 --> 00:10:10.901
then only you will understand
that you are also getting peace.

00:10:12.266 --> 00:10:18.329
Here you have come to get peace, not to create problems,

00:10:18.409 --> 00:10:23.954
or to listen to your problems, but to get to peace.

00:10:24.034 --> 00:10:33.400
Peace is a nature or is the quality of your Spirit.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:38.722
So, once you jump onto your peace somehow

00:10:38.802 --> 00:10:46.740
what happens that you go beyond the cause and the effect.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.691
You are beyond the cause and the effect.

00:10:49.771 --> 00:10:54.731
So the cause disappears and the effect also disappears.

00:10:54.811 --> 00:11:01.476
So today we all have come here to
worship the peace, the within and the without.

00:11:01.556 --> 00:11:06.509
Let us be peaceful people.
Let us not join groups who hate,

00:11:06.589 --> 00:11:11.344
who talk big, who want to hate
one person, want to create a group,

00:11:11.424 --> 00:11:17.032
who says "we the Americans" or "we the this", just.

00:11:17.112 --> 00:11:23.778
In Sahaja Yoga you must learn
from people who have advanced,

00:11:23.858 --> 00:11:26.532
who have very much progressed.

00:11:29.999 --> 00:11:37.000
So the cause was the car or the brake or whatever it was,

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:42.367
the mechanism, and the effect was all the problem.

00:11:42.447 --> 00:11:47.960
So now, how to overcome that problem?

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:53.670
Supposing you try to neutralize the effect, you cannot,
because cause is still there.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.737
You try to improve the cause, it doesn't work out.

00:11:56.817 --> 00:11:59.564
Then what to do?

00:11:59.644 --> 00:12:04.451
So the easiest thing is to cross the cause,

00:12:04.531 --> 00:12:09.904
to ascend over, to go beyond the cause;

00:12:09.984 --> 00:12:14.461
so the cause does not exist for you,
so the effect does not exist for you.

00:12:14.541 --> 00:12:19.745
As long as the cause exists in
your attention, the effect will be there.

00:12:19.825 --> 00:12:21.312
So what did she do?

00:12:21.392 --> 00:12:24.251
She just prayed to Me, just thought of Me that

00:12:24.331 --> 00:12:29.644
Mother, now it's my last chance - that's all.

00:12:29.724 --> 00:12:34.409
So the cause disappeared, because you go beyond it.

00:12:34.489 --> 00:12:39.378
And the effect also disappeared, and she was surprised.

00:12:41.798 --> 00:12:47.198
So you must ascend away from the cause.

00:12:48.858 --> 00:12:51.978
Now a problem: "my wife is like this",

00:12:52.058 --> 00:12:55.345
my husband like this, "my family life is this,"

00:12:55.425 --> 00:12:59.644
Sahaja yogis are like this -
all kinds of things are there.

00:12:59.724 --> 00:13:05.745
It's an effect. Now what's the cause?
Is such and such person.

00:13:05.825 --> 00:13:09.178
All right, now what are we to get - relation of the cause.

00:13:09.258 --> 00:13:10.328
Surrender it.

00:13:10.408 --> 00:13:14.365
You are, you have the right to do that.

00:13:14.925 --> 00:13:17.897
You have a knack to do it, you can do it.

00:13:17.977 --> 00:13:21.651
You are capable of it, you are entitled to do it.

00:13:21.731 --> 00:13:24.345
But you don't do it, you forget.

00:13:24.425 --> 00:13:27.077
You just forget.

00:13:28.392 --> 00:13:34.479
If you surrender that cause,
the effects will go away.

00:13:34.559 --> 00:13:37.878
But that is the thing at that time to remember,

00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.644
that you have to ascend.

00:13:40.724 --> 00:13:47.067
To go beyond the cause is the best way to get rid of it.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:55.080
But that emergency has to come.
Human beings are such that unless and until

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.233
they are put into tight corners, they never do that.

00:13:59.313 --> 00:14:03.618
Once they are in a tight corner, then they do it.

00:14:03.698 --> 00:14:07.177
That is the reason why people try to take ascetic life,

00:14:07.257 --> 00:14:10.510
because if you are an ascetic
then you are in a tight corner.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:16.210
But how do we achieve it otherwise, without any ... ?

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:19.510
Only way is meditation.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:23.078
Everybody must meditate, it's the point.

00:14:23.158 --> 00:14:27.078
If you do not meditate, you can continue for a while.

00:14:27.158 --> 00:14:29.577
You may be all right for a while

00:14:29.657 --> 00:14:32.084
for two, three months, maybe two years,

00:14:32.164 --> 00:14:35.210
but then you drop out.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:39.210
Many people think, "Oh, what's the
need to meditate? You see, it's all right.

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:42.911
If we don't meditate, doesn't matter." It's not so.

00:14:42.991 --> 00:14:46.911
Because in meditation only you grow.

00:14:46.991 --> 00:14:50.210
In emergency you suddenly grow, no doubt.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:53.711
I mean, you jump like a jack-in-the- box.

00:14:53.791 --> 00:14:56.444
You just come up with a spring.

00:14:56.524 --> 00:15:00.243
But if you have to have continuous growth

00:15:00.323 --> 00:15:03.210
then you must meditate,

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:10.243
allow the thoughts after thoughts coming,

00:15:10.323 --> 00:15:12.744
and then allow them to subside,

00:15:12.824 --> 00:15:16.911
because you rise into the state of thoughtless awareness.

00:15:16.991 --> 00:15:20.911
And in that thoughtless awareness you grow.

00:15:20.991 --> 00:15:24.044
And you grow in your detachment

00:15:24.124 --> 00:15:27.996
to the cause of all the effects.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:33.428
If there is no cause, there is no effect.

00:15:34.258 --> 00:15:40.947
But this is the problem with us, is
that we do not meditate, normally.

00:15:41.027 --> 00:15:44.210
Only when it comes to absolute last point,

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:49.896
now you'll have to fall in the well - then we think of it.

00:15:49.976 --> 00:15:53.810
Maybe at that moment you are helped,

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:56.741
but you don't grow.

00:15:59.158 --> 00:16:04.078
Growth can only come if you meditate.

00:16:04.158 --> 00:16:06.777
That is one very important part,

00:16:06.857 --> 00:16:16.136
is complete help to people who meditate in the normal way.

00:16:16.791 --> 00:16:19.178
In the normal life, how do we grow?

00:16:19.258 --> 00:16:22.677
If we have no oxygen, we cannot grow.

00:16:22.757 --> 00:16:26.377
We have to have sufficient oxygen,
we have to have sufficient food,

00:16:26.457 --> 00:16:31.510
we have to have all these things. 
But in spirituality you grow through meditation.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.111
There's no way out.

00:16:33.191 --> 00:16:38.243
Those who think they can grow are bumptious,

00:16:38.323 --> 00:16:40.677
actually bumptious people,

00:16:40.757 --> 00:16:43.377
because they can talk a lot about Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:43.457 --> 00:16:46.711
I have seen people who talk too much about Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:46.791 --> 00:16:49.777
They can give big lectures, this, that,

00:16:49.857 --> 00:16:51.911
but have no vibrations at all.

00:16:51.991 --> 00:16:54.044
They can't do any work for Sahaja Yoga,

00:16:54.124 --> 00:16:57.711
they are not collective, they
have no sense to be collective,

00:16:57.791 --> 00:16:59.844
all kinds of problems.

00:16:59.924 --> 00:17:05.991
But the growth is to be achieved through meditation.

00:17:07.124 --> 00:17:09.911
That is one part of it.

00:17:09.991 --> 00:17:15.353
That is, we can say, is the worship, is the puja.

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:21.610
Then you don't have to give up anything,
you just become detached,

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:24.897
detached from the cause itself.

00:17:24.977 --> 00:17:27.364
May God bless you all.
