WEBVTT

00:57.083 --> 00:59.500
Sahaja yogis should not fall to such a level

01:00.041 --> 01:04.375
of mundane type of people after all what is going to happen to you

01:04.417 --> 01:08.792
I would say those who have been worrying and all that,

01:08.834 --> 01:11.291
should go into great meditation and understand

01:11.333 --> 01:15.208
that you are insulting yourself. You are saints;

01:15.250 --> 01:17.458
why should you worry about what plane you are going to get,

01:17.500 --> 01:21.583
what you are not going to get? Shows that your level is very low;

01:21.625 --> 01:24.041
definitely; all those who have worried.

01:24.041 --> 01:30.583
You have come here under My protection,

01:30.625 --> 01:41.291
and you will go back under My protection.

01:41.333 --> 01:44.208
we’ll not have any pujas. You must know

01:44.208 --> 01:49.875
that you are all part and parcel of My being;

01:49.917 --> 01:58.125
I have put you in My body and you have to behave yourself.

01:58.125 --> 02:08.041
so in such an auspicious day when we all have come here

02:08.083 --> 02:16.792
to do this special puja, and I would say this should be called

02:16.834 --> 02:21.709
as a Mahalakshmi Puja because it’s something to do

02:21.709 --> 02:25.625
with the industry of this country, and of the whole world.

02:25.667 --> 02:35.667
Unless and until all those human ventures are connected with God

02:35.709 --> 02:41.500
they cannot get their perfect stage and their status.

02:41.542 --> 02:45.291
That’s why we have problems now in the West.

02:45.333 --> 02:48.417
Supposed to be very clever people, very smart,

02:48.417 --> 02:53.333
very well equipped, well educated. We are having recessions

02:53.375 --> 02:56.375
and things because they have no balance.

02:56.375 --> 03:01.834
They don’t know that there is God’s power which works everything,

03:01.875 --> 03:06.166
and when you neglect that, this is what happens to you.

03:06.166 --> 03:17.834
Now for any venture that we do of this kind,

03:17.834 --> 03:23.166
first of all we have to use a lot of material from the Mother Earth,

03:23.208 --> 03:30.709
but if it is taken for a proper purpose, for constructive things

03:30.750 --> 03:35.625
and for helping others, with a balance,

03:35.667 --> 03:43.291
then Mother Earth can think, She can produce, more and more,

03:43.291 --> 03:45.750
all this She has produced before.

03:45.792 --> 03:48.542
She can produce for people who are sensible,

03:48.583 --> 03:58.250
who are in tune with God, not just making money for themselves,

03:58.291 --> 04:09.750
or for their own purpose, but are thinking in totality,

04:09.750 --> 04:15.291
thinking as to what we can achieve by doing this.

04:15.333 --> 04:21.792
And that is how an industry can grow.

04:21.834 --> 04:25.291
Now we see in Japan so much industry has grown,

04:25.333 --> 04:30.333
but no spirituality. They are not at all happy people.

04:30.375 --> 04:36.500
Their children are suffering, families are suffering.

04:36.500 --> 04:44.667
Money cannot get the total well being of a human being.

04:44.709 --> 04:48.875
So a balance has to be drawn.

04:48.875 --> 04:53.792
Especially in our country, thank God, we didn’t have

04:53.792 --> 04:59.542
such a fast industrialization, and that’s why we are saved

04:59.542 --> 05:02.250
of lots of problems that the Western people are suffering,

05:02.291 --> 05:04.875
about which the Indians are not aware.

05:04.917 --> 05:09.583
They think you are all living in a very comfortable life there.

05:09.625 --> 05:17.792
Industry has to go hand-in-hand with the handicrafts,

05:17.792 --> 05:24.792
and the industrialists have to also look after the artists,

05:24.834 --> 05:28.542
because otherwise who will look after them?

05:28.583 --> 05:32.500
How will they bring forth the balance between the art and the industry?

05:32.542 --> 05:37.875
And art is such a soothing thing for these hard-working people.

05:37.875 --> 05:41.792
They work the whole day, then there is some sort of a music,

05:41.792 --> 05:51.750
art, to console them, to give them peace, to relax them,

05:51.792 --> 05:59.250
and a balance. So I would say that all industries

05:59.291 --> 06:06.250
must take to some artistic ventures also, or they should also produce things.

06:06.250 --> 06:10.667
After I was telling Rajesh many a times that you should try to produce

06:10.709 --> 06:16.208
something artistic out of the steel scrap that is left over, will be a good idea.

06:16.208 --> 06:18.083
They have tried something like that.

06:18.125 --> 06:25.458
But industry should not be looked down upon

06:25.500 --> 06:27.917
as it is looked down upon in our country.

06:27.959 --> 06:30.500
I mean, as if industrialists are the greatest thieves

06:30.542 --> 06:35.750
and all the politicians are saints in this country. It’s the other way around I think.

06:35.750 --> 06:38.500
It should be treated with respect,

06:38.542 --> 06:40.667
and should be understood that it’s very important.

06:40.709 --> 06:46.250
And the industrialists, if they become also enlightened,

06:46.250 --> 06:52.625
they can do a lot, not only to their own country,

06:52.667 --> 06:55.500
but also to the people whom they are looking after.

06:55.542 --> 06:58.458
So in the Mahalakshmi principle,

06:58.500 --> 07:02.750
Mahalakshmi has various mudras.

07:02.792 --> 07:10.583
One of the mudra is that She puts Her right hand like this.

07:10.583 --> 07:16.041
Now this right hand is to give protection to people

07:16.041 --> 07:22.500
who are under the protection, or under the service,

07:22.500 --> 07:25.333
of some rich man, or the industrialist we can call it.

07:25.333 --> 07:29.417
In India if you call somebody a rich man it’s like abusing him.

07:29.458 --> 07:33.208
Nobody likes it, because the rich are always shown

07:33.250 --> 07:35.709
to be the worst people, which is not so.

07:35.750 --> 07:40.000
In My own experience it’s not so. If there’s a poor man also he could be terrible.

07:40.041 --> 07:43.333
We have had very bad experiences now, in Ganapatipule,

07:43.375 --> 07:45.500
of very poor people how they behaved

07:45.542 --> 07:49.166
in a very funny manner - supposed to be poor.

07:49.208 --> 08:00.166
So it should be a proper balance, it should be brought to a proper balance,

08:00.166 --> 08:05.667
between the understanding of the poor and the rich, and the rich and the poor.

08:05.709 --> 08:13.667
After some time you will find that people will not consider poverty

08:13.709 --> 08:20.417
or riches as so important, but the richness of the spirit

08:20.458 --> 08:22.875
will become very important.

08:22.917 --> 08:25.999
That is what is going to be the Sahaj nations

08:25.999 --> 08:30.583
where the richness of the heart, the spirituality,

08:30.583 --> 08:35.792
oneness with the Divine, will become the greatest boon

08:35.834 --> 08:42.291
for everyone. But still we are struggling

08:42.333 --> 08:49.208
to be on that state; many are; and still we go into materialistic tantrums

08:49.250 --> 08:55.250
or some sort of a stupid worrying fall.

08:55.291 --> 08:58.834
All these must be carefully watched.

08:58.875 --> 09:06.041
If you can keep this chariot of new progress

09:06.083 --> 09:08.458
progressing faster

09:08.500 --> 09:12.709
we are going to create a new world of complete harmony,

09:12.709 --> 09:17.917
complete peace, joy and love. But for that

09:17.917 --> 09:24.125
you are the ones who have to do it. I cannot do it.

09:24.166 --> 09:25.458
If I could have done it

09:25.458 --> 09:27.375
I would not have asked you to join Sahaja Yoga.

09:27.417 --> 09:30.250
It’s like the horses and the charioteer;

09:30.250 --> 09:38.125
horses are to be driven; charioteer doesn’t drive the chariot.

09:38.166 --> 09:42.583
In the same way you must understand your responsibility

09:42.583 --> 09:45.291
that this is the greatest work we are doing.

09:45.333 --> 09:54.083
It’s not only the industry, or the labor and the capital,

09:54.125 --> 09:58.542
I’m talking about, but I’m talking about the totality of well being.

09:58.542 --> 10:03.709
Of course all of this is a part and parcel of that, no doubt.

10:03.750 --> 10:07.500
But the balance should be with the totality.

10:07.542 --> 10:12.250
So we have to think of a total well being.

10:12.291 --> 10:16.542
Once we start thinking of the total well being then –

10:16.583 --> 10:18.208
first thing that should come to us:

10:18.208 --> 10:23.125
Are we capable of bringing up that total well being? Are we?

10:23.125 --> 10:29.166
Have we got the total well being within ourselves or not? Have we?

10:29.208 --> 10:31.834
We are still worried if the plane is coming or not,

10:31.834 --> 10:34.999
I mean, we are so mundane, so little, so small.

10:34.999 --> 10:44.041
With one bandhan you can control any plane, any atmosphere,

10:44.041 --> 10:48.125
and here you are, I mean, still worried about things

10:48.166 --> 10:51.041
which are absolutely under your control.

10:51.083 --> 10:56.250
So this totality has to be thought over.

10:56.250 --> 11:00.625
What is this totality that Mother is talking about?

11:00.625 --> 11:07.834
In this totality a world has to be created of people,

11:07.834 --> 11:21.750
by the people, who have no fear. This fear has to be given up.

11:21.792 --> 11:25.291
Behind all this nonsensical nervousness is fear.

11:25.291 --> 11:33.208
So for that, what She does is to give  Avaida

11:33.250 --> 11:39.959
Under Her protection you are beyond fear, you are protected.

11:39.999 --> 11:43.000
But if you do not want to believe in yourself,

11:43.041 --> 11:49.041
and you don’t believe into Her protection, then no body can help you,

11:49.083 --> 11:52.500
because everything is mythical for you.

11:52.542 --> 12:02.709
In every venture that we take up we should not have any fear

12:02.750 --> 12:08.667
because God is with you. Is a fact, is the truth. You just try.

12:08.667 --> 12:15.125
But when you try through your ego you fall into the trap of fear.

12:15.125 --> 12:18.750
I have seen egoistical people are the most frightened people,

12:18.792 --> 12:22.250
and panicked, because they panic others

12:22.291 --> 12:25.542
and so they think they can be panicked one day.

12:25.542 --> 12:29.999
When the English were here, first of all, in India,

12:29.999 --> 12:34.667
we were all frightened of them. Now I see

12:34.709 --> 12:38.750
that in England every English family is frightened of others.

12:38.750 --> 12:42.375
They’ll only open a chink of the door to see who is there,

12:42.417 --> 12:46.709
and shut it. They’re so frightened. I’m surprised,

12:46.750 --> 12:48.750
they are the same English who ruled us here.

12:48.750 --> 12:51.375
And we were so bewitched before them and now

12:51.417 --> 12:53.667
they are the ones who are frightened of us;

12:53.709 --> 12:57.041
because when a person who is egoistical tries to dominate others

12:57.083 --> 13:01.250
he sees himself in the mirror and thinks

13:01.250 --> 13:03.583
that the other person will dominate him.

13:03.625 --> 13:07.375
That’s how this fear creeps in, into our minds,

13:07.375 --> 13:11.583
and we start getting all kinds of these stupid tantrums

13:11.625 --> 13:14.875
out of this mythical fear.

13:14.917 --> 13:19.917
The fear is created by our ego.

13:19.959 --> 13:26.083
A person who has no ego, he’ll have no fear

13:26.083 --> 13:27.583
because he has not harmed anyone.

13:27.625 --> 13:31.583
Why should he have any fear? And such a man, or such a woman,

13:31.625 --> 13:35.542
will be looked after by God, because God takes over.

13:35.583 --> 13:40.458
When you surrender your ego to God He takes over.

13:40.500 --> 13:44.458
But those who have ego He says, “All right, go ahead,

13:44.458 --> 13:47.709
use your ego, try to protect yourself, cut your throat.”

13:47.709 --> 13:55.792
That’s what it is. So when I talk of total benevolence

13:55.792 --> 14:01.083
I’m talking about your own total benevolence.

14:01.125 --> 14:03.000
So first is the fear,

14:03.041 --> 14:06.333
which should go out of your mind completely

14:06.375 --> 14:10.834
if you believe in the Almighty God. We’ll say,

14:10.875 --> 14:13.542
“You are Almighty God, you are almighty this thing”

14:13.542 --> 14:17.166
It's all lip-service. If you believe that God is almighty,

14:17.208 --> 14:18.959
and you are connected with God,

14:18.999 --> 14:21.834
then why should you have any fear of anything?

14:21.834 --> 14:26.792
But when we say, “Don’t have fear,” another extreme comes up,

14:26.792 --> 14:29.792
“We don’t have fear, we can do what we like,

14:29.834 --> 14:35.000
we can perform everything ourselves, we need not tell anyone.”

14:35.041 --> 14:39.125
You have to tell God whatever you are doing.

14:39.166 --> 14:45.750
You have to take permission, you have to inform in His darbar,

14:45.750 --> 14:52.417
in His court, that, “Sir, we are thinking of doing such and such thing.”

14:52.458 --> 14:58.750
But you think you are God. You are not.

14:58.792 --> 15:02.792
And that’s why the another part of non-fear

15:02.834 --> 15:05.667
is this kind of an arbitrary behavior

15:05.709 --> 15:08.208
which is very dangerous for Sahaja Yoga,

15:08.250 --> 15:10.917
for yourself, and for everybody else.

15:10.959 --> 15:21.500
The second fear, I mean, I have, is that if I tell you anything,

15:21.542 --> 15:26.959
ninety-nine percent of you understand is for your benevolence,

15:26.999 --> 15:30.583
is for your good. But there is one percent of people

15:30.583 --> 15:36.542
who can just react because they have too much ego and they won’t take it,

15:36.542 --> 15:39.500
because they don’t think of their own benevolence.

15:39.500 --> 15:43.375
They don’t understand that if I am telling them anything,

15:43.417 --> 15:50.667
it is just to give them completeness, totality.

15:50.709 --> 15:55.291
But, on the contrary, they take a very wrong attitude;

15:55.291 --> 15:59.917
this is another nonsensity. So now one has to develop

15:59.917 --> 16:04.250
a kind of a indifference to this kind of people

16:04.250 --> 16:09.375
who unnecessarily go to the other limit of their own destruction,

16:09.417 --> 16:13.417
and don’t want to see what is the point in everything

16:13.458 --> 16:16.667
that I am telling you. Only I can tell you. Who else?

16:16.709 --> 16:19.250
I have to tell you what’s wrong with you,

16:19.250 --> 16:22.083
what you have done wrong, and then you must change it.

16:22.125 --> 16:29.041
This is another style of reaction one gets,

16:29.083 --> 16:31.625
means they are not interested in their own benevolence,

16:31.625 --> 16:34.999
they’re not interested in the benevolence of their children,

16:34.999 --> 16:39.375
they’re not interested in the benevolence of their country or the whole world.

16:39.375 --> 16:43.250
Now why have you come to Sahaja Yoga? Just ask one question.

16:43.250 --> 16:47.625
Of course for you to ascend. But ascend for what?

16:47.625 --> 16:51.417
Supposing we bring one tube light.

16:51.417 --> 16:55.625
For what we have to take the tube light? But for what?

16:55.667 --> 16:59.041
We have to put the light. But this tube light doesn’t give light,

16:59.083 --> 17:02.458
nothing of the kind, so what’s the use of having this tube light?

17:02.500 --> 17:07.166
In the same way, what’s the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga

17:07.166 --> 17:14.250
if you cannot become the light of the Divine?

17:14.250 --> 17:24.500
So all of you, each one of you, is not at all a small person;

17:24.500 --> 17:27.709
no one; but you don’t realize what you are;

17:27.750 --> 17:32.542
still have those funny conditionings by which you think

17:32.542 --> 17:35.125
you are no good. All of you can come up,

17:35.125 --> 17:39.417
and see so many people. If they take to total benevolence

17:39.458 --> 17:47.125
within themselves it will manifest itself outside; absolutely; it’s a fact.

17:47.125 --> 17:52.875
Then the attention is very important.

17:52.917 --> 17:57.333
The attention should be on your own perfection

17:57.375 --> 18:03.917
and on your total benevolence. This is also another point people miss,

18:03.959 --> 18:06.500
that they start finding faults with others

18:06.542 --> 18:10.125
instead of finding faults with themselves.

18:10.166 --> 18:15.834
As a result, if you look at others, what will you get out of it?

18:15.875 --> 18:21.417
I just don’t understand. If somebody is wrong,

18:21.458 --> 18:24.959
he’s doing something evil, he's bad, even if you put attention to him,

18:24.959 --> 18:31.667
what will you do about it? But if you have something wrong,

18:31.709 --> 18:34.166
you have every right, you have every control,

18:34.208 --> 18:42.834
and you can correct yourself. This is especially Indian quality,

18:42.834 --> 18:44.999
is to find faults with others.

18:44.999 --> 18:49.417
They’ll never see that what’s wrong with us.

18:49.458 --> 18:55.375
All the time the attention is involved in finding with faults with others.

18:55.417 --> 19:02.333
Then how can we improve? On the contrary,

19:02.333 --> 19:06.291
if you start seeing faults, you get faulty much more.

19:06.333 --> 19:10.750
It’s a copycat nature of human beings.

19:10.792 --> 19:13.250
They see somebody doing like this,

19:13.291 --> 19:16.208
“Oh Mother, he’s a Sahaja yogi, he does like this,

19:16.250 --> 19:18.417
so what’s the harm if I do?”

19:18.417 --> 19:20.667
But who says he’s a Sahaja yogi?

19:20.667 --> 19:24.625
So ‘Sahaja yogi’ is not a brand, it's not a certificate,

19:24.667 --> 19:31.417
it’s not a kind of a organization, but it is your own status

19:31.458 --> 19:34.917
that you have achieved. Anybody can say,

19:34.959 --> 19:37.792
“I’m a Sahaja Yogi.” After all I cannot stop him from saying.

19:37.834 --> 19:40.792
I’m not such a ...(unclear). Even I have seen some mad people,

19:40.792 --> 19:43.417
they are Sahaja yogis, for years together they’re mad,

19:43.458 --> 19:49.417
but they’re Sahaja yogis. But you have to see for yourself,

19:49.417 --> 19:52.500
am I a Sahaja yogi or not? Before certifying yourself,

19:52.542 --> 19:58.750
why don’t you find out? But despite that, I must say,

19:58.792 --> 20:04.208
it's such a satisfaction. I never expected that so many people

20:04.250 --> 20:07.041
will get their realization to begin with, never.

20:07.083 --> 20:13.834
I mean, I knew that it was en masse modus operandi I have developed,

20:13.834 --> 20:19.166
but I never expected. But it has happened,

20:19.208 --> 20:24.875
and even now I have to expect that all of you

20:24.917 --> 20:29.750
will achieve the highest, highest positions, the paramapada (Sanskrit word),

20:29.750 --> 20:35.166
as I said, like the North Pole, or like the Meru; absolutely atala (Indian word)

20:35.208 --> 20:38.333
‘which cannot be disturbed’. So that’s My hope,

20:38.375 --> 20:41.166
and I’m sure you will all comply with it.

20:41.208 --> 21:09.999
(Talk continues in Marathi then returns to English)

31:55.542 --> 31:57.208
I’ll tell you in English. I have told you many a times

31:57.208 --> 32:00.291
about Namadeva and Gorakumbhar, how Gorakumbhar,

32:00.291 --> 32:03.583
when he saw Namadeva, Namadeva saw Gorakumbhar

32:03.625 --> 32:08.041
was kneading the clay for his pottery,

32:08.083 --> 32:11.834
he just went and stood before him stunned.

32:11.834 --> 32:20.041
And what he says that, “I have come to see here the formless”

32:20.083 --> 32:25.041
(that’s the vibrations). “But the Formless is in a form”

32:25.083 --> 32:28.750
This is the appreciation one should have,

32:28.792 --> 32:30.792
one Sahaja yogi should have for another.

32:30.834 --> 32:34.750
Every Sahaja yogi is a gem.

32:34.792 --> 32:40.208
Even the thought of a gem should bring joy to you.

32:40.250 --> 32:45.792
In every life, every style, in every areas, every dimensions,

32:45.834 --> 32:53.291
one should have this kind of a feeling. Muslims, Hindus, Christians,

32:53.333 --> 32:56.875
we do not accept. For us we are all Sahaja yogis,

32:56.917 --> 33:00.999
and we have faith in all the religions, not some above.

33:00.999 --> 33:04.999
We have faith in every thing. As well as we worship Rama

33:04.999 --> 33:09.500
we worship Muhammad Sahib also, same way, no less.

33:09.542 --> 33:13.333
As we worship Brahmadeva, or as we worship,

33:13.333 --> 33:18.166
we say, Dattatreya, we worship Zoroaster, there’s no difference at all,

33:18.208 --> 33:23.291
same way. There’s a big difference in having just a same,

33:23.291 --> 33:28.333
what you call, the same respect; it’s not that;

33:28.375 --> 33:32.834
but we worship the same way, so there’s no question

33:32.834 --> 33:37.333
of differentiating each other; nor on country-wise, nothing.

33:37.333 --> 33:40.750
And whatever defects we have, we see to it

33:40.792 --> 33:42.917
that this has come from our country;

33:42.959 --> 33:46.333
which I see many Sahaja yogis tell Me, “This is typical English,

33:46.375 --> 33:49.917
this is typically French, this is typically Italian.”

33:49.959 --> 33:56.041
They themselves tell Me. But main thing one has to understand is this,

33:56.083 --> 34:00.875
that in Sahaja Yoga we have lost all these boundaries; nothing is there.

34:00.917 --> 34:03.999
We have reached that state where we are all one.

34:04.000 --> 34:09.458
And the idea of any Sahaja yogi whatsoever,

34:09.458 --> 34:12.291
and any individual Sahaja yogi, or a group of Sahaja yogis,

34:12.291 --> 34:21.208
should fill you up with joy and a kind of a wave of joy

34:21.208 --> 34:27.375
which is continuously coming, because they are in the form of joy,

34:27.417 --> 34:33.000
peace. If this appreciation is reached, then only one can say

34:33.041 --> 34:38.291
that you are Sahaja yogis, and that is one of the tests I have seen.

34:38.333 --> 34:40.834
You love Me very much I know, all of you,

34:40.834 --> 34:44.917
but unless and until you love each other how am I going to be happy?

34:44.917 --> 34:49.834
So today specially, this Mahalakshmi principle,

34:49.875 --> 34:55.000
when it is awakened within you, then you get out of a Lakshmi principle,

34:55.041 --> 34:57.999
which makes you a little selfish maybe, self-centered,

34:57.999 --> 35:01.875
and you get into a new dimension of searching,

35:01.917 --> 35:08.166
of searching the higher value system, something beyond,

35:08.208 --> 35:14.250
without any limitations. And that Mahalakshmi principle

35:14.291 --> 35:19.667
is really nothing, in essence, if you see, is nothing but you are seeking the universal love,

35:19.667 --> 35:26.667
in the essence it is that. We don’t love people

35:26.709 --> 35:30.041
because they belong to some country, because they look like this,

35:30.083 --> 35:32.875
that this is this; nothing; we love them

35:32.917 --> 35:38.875
only because they are our part and parcel, we are one with them.

35:38.917 --> 35:43.667
So those who are today worshipping Mahalakshmi should feel

35:43.667 --> 35:46.041
how many worshippers of Mahalakshmi are there,

35:46.041 --> 35:49.917
and they are all our own. It’s such a great feeling.

35:49.959 --> 35:56.792
Otherwise, in Maharashtra especially, I must say, it was horrible,

35:56.834 --> 36:01.000
one Sahaja yogi goes to preach in another Sahaj, another district.

36:01.041 --> 36:09.083
(Background noise) The district leader starts fighting, just like this sound,

36:09.083 --> 36:14.250
“Who are you to come here? I’m the leader”

36:14.291 --> 36:22.000
Instead of respecting him, and making him a welcome guest,

36:22.041 --> 36:26.917
asking him what can you help, there’s a big fight.

36:26.959 --> 36:32.999
It’s really surprising. How can it happen?

36:33.000 --> 36:38.291
When Namadeva went to Punjab, Guru Nanak Sahib respected him;

36:38.291 --> 36:40.709
not only that, but he told him that,

36:40.750 --> 36:43.458
“You write now in Punjabi language also.”

36:43.500 --> 36:47.041
I have seen such a big book written by Namadeva. Can you imagine?

36:47.041 --> 36:52.166
He included all the great saints of Maharashtra in his Granth Sahib,

36:52.208 --> 36:57.875
because he knew that these are realized souls, they are higher souls.

36:57.917 --> 37:01.917
But these Sikhs are only reading it; nothing goes into their heads.

37:01.959 --> 37:07.542
What can you do? So at that time,

37:07.542 --> 37:10.709
if these saints could love each other,

37:10.750 --> 37:16.375
could express themselves in such a manner, why not we,

37:16.375 --> 37:18.792
the Sahaja yogis from all over the world?

37:18.834 --> 37:23.834
So I would say now, that, let us see, it’s a very nice program of Ras

37:23.875 --> 37:28.959
(Indian word) we’ll be having, where all the Indian and foreign Sahaja yogis are going to be together,

37:28.999 --> 37:32.500
and are going to dance together. All such things are there.

37:32.542 --> 37:37.375
So don’t sit in groups, but mix up with others, know them,

37:37.417 --> 37:40.542
and this is what we are going to know;

37:40.583 --> 37:45.500
each and every Sahaja yogi of the whole world.

37:45.542 --> 37:51.125
Is very important for Me that you should love each other.

37:51.166 --> 37:55.917
It will really soothe Me the most, it will give Me the greatest joy,

37:55.959 --> 38:03.792
the greatest achievement, and the fulfillment of My life.

38:03.834 --> 38:11.542
If somebody is really, definitely wrong, you just write to Me

38:11.542 --> 38:15.208
and I will know, because immediately I’ll know from vibrations.

38:15.250 --> 38:17.375
Nobody can befool Me, that’s one thing for sure.

38:17.417 --> 38:19.667
Some people say that, “Somebody has told this to Mother.

38:19.709 --> 38:21.959
” Nothing can be told to Mother, you don’t know;

38:21.999 --> 38:25.625
I am too cunning for all this. Nobody can tell Me anything;

38:25.667 --> 38:28.041
I know each and every... I play around a little bit,

38:28.083 --> 38:31.667
but I know each and every person. I give them a chance

38:31.709 --> 38:33.834
to hang themselves for a time being.

38:33.834 --> 38:38.125
But never believe that anybody can befool Me, and tell anything.

38:38.125 --> 38:47.709
I listen to everyone, and you can try that.

38:47.750 --> 38:52.333
If you love another Sahaja yogi,

38:52.333 --> 38:57.458
this loving process itself is so joy giving.

38:57.500 --> 39:04.625
When you first saw Me this time on the stage, you felt that way,

39:04.667 --> 39:11.166
because this process of loving is the greatest joy-giving thing.

39:11.208 --> 39:16.999
So be happy, be joyous. If some people are missing the plane,

39:16.999 --> 39:19.917
well and good, you will live with other Sahaja yogis,

39:19.959 --> 39:23.375
you are after all, you are somewhere in the world, you are not lost.

39:23.375 --> 39:26.750
Even if you are in the sea, you are there, on the plane you are there.

39:26.750 --> 39:32.500
What does it matter? Why is it so important

39:32.542 --> 39:36.417
that this plane must be reserved, and you must worry about this plane,

39:36.458 --> 39:39.291
“I must get out at this time” There’s no need.

39:39.291 --> 39:43.083
Wherever you are you are with Sahaja yogis,

39:43.125 --> 39:44.959
so why worry?

39:44.959 --> 39:50.750
You are, that’s the point. Like many people ask Me,

39:50.750 --> 39:53.291
“Mother You travel so much, how is it You don’t get tired?”

39:53.291 --> 39:55.917
Because I never think I am travelling, I just think, “I am,”

39:55.959 --> 39:58.917
that’s all. Whether in the plane or here, or there,

39:58.917 --> 40:03.375
I am just there. I have to tell Me I am traveling,

40:03.375 --> 40:09.041
then again I forget. So you are,

40:09.083 --> 40:12.792
whether you are here or in England, or anywhere,

40:12.834 --> 40:18.667
or you are here or you are there. So why to worry?

40:18.667 --> 40:21.458
Specially with the plane - I think there is something wrong

40:21.458 --> 40:27.625
with the Western genetics - the plane enters into their Kundalini,

40:27.667 --> 40:31.999
I think, and they go so bizarre with the airplanes.

40:31.999 --> 40:35.500
Something I’ve never been able to understand it.

40:35.500 --> 40:38.959
I’ve given them so many lessons to show that don’t do all this nonsense,

40:38.999 --> 40:41.083
but still they go on doing like this.

40:41.125 --> 40:44.375
But if I tell them they feel guilty,but again they do it.

40:44.417 --> 40:47.834
Next time if your plane is eight o’clock,

40:47.875 --> 40:52.500
go at nine o’clock, the plane will wait for you till ten o’clock,

40:52.542 --> 40:57.125
take it from Me. It has happened; so many can tell this.

40:57.166 --> 41:03.208
So many experiences are there. I mean, we haven’t written them down,

41:03.250 --> 41:07.208
but people know how planes have been delayed for us.

41:07.208 --> 41:11.375
I have never missed a plane all My life, and when I missed it,

41:11.375 --> 41:13.917
it was with a purpose; these big things happened.

41:13.917 --> 41:17.125
So it is important, it’s a drama.

41:17.166 --> 41:24.917
The worry should be one:

41:24.959 --> 41:32.542
“Why can’t I love everyone as I love myself?”

41:32.542 --> 41:39.750
I tell you only this universal love will give you

41:39.792 --> 41:45.041
that confidence and that higher status.

41:45.083 --> 41:47.750
Why these saints suffered for you?

41:47.750 --> 41:52.125
Why did Christ suffer for you?

41:52.125 --> 41:53.750
Why Muhammad Sahib suffered for you?

41:53.792 --> 41:56.166
Why anybody talked to you about Dharma?

41:56.208 --> 42:01.125
Why Gnaneshwara wrote Gnaneshwari? Why?

42:01.166 --> 42:03.250
What did they get?

42:03.291 --> 42:10.500
This satisfaction of their expression of universal love.

42:10.542 --> 42:14.959
All the great poets, William Blake or anyone,

42:14.959 --> 42:17.208
whatever they have done, it’s just

42:17.208 --> 42:21.250
because they have this universal love and they want to express it.

42:21.291 --> 42:22.959
Why not you do it?

42:22.999 --> 42:27.999
So if you want your Mahalakshmi principle

42:28.041 --> 42:31.667
to be all the time burning, then please

42:31.709 --> 42:35.792
see that you love each and every Sahaja yogi.

42:35.834 --> 42:38.542
That’s the message today. I hope you’ll understand that.

42:38.583 --> 42:41.417
May God bless you.
