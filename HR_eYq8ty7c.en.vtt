00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.720
Today I want to talk to you about children

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.200
because yesterday we talked about the Mooladhara.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.040
Now why we are not so collective

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.160
as we should have been much more collective.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.640
There has been conditioning on us

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.760
from our early childhood, if you see.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.480
In the western life, we are shut in our houses.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.200
We don't have relationships with others.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.320
We are kept extremely protected in childhood.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:15.720
I think the parents have the fear in this country that we'll lose our children

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:21.520
because they get lost. After they start getting their [dough/roles?]

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:26.440
most of the children leave their parents and go away.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.520
Parents are left high and dry.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:34.560
They feel that our children will leave us at the slightest pretext.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:42.200
So they teach them not to talk to anyone, to be away from everyone

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:48.480
and cuddle their own children all the time, look after their own children

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:53.200
and they can't see a child talking to another lady.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:58.000
They feel jealous. And they feel that the child will be lost

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.040
because they think that they cannot give adequate love.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:07.200
If anybody can give love to their child they feel that that child will be lost.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:13.800
And the child also becomes such a individualistic child

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.440
that it takes life into a very particular type of a person

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.560
and then after some time

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.520
that person starts overpowering that child

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.840
and the parents leave the child.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.840
It's a very sick society in that way.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.880
As far as the children are concerned, it's a sick society.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.520
It doesn't know how to bring up their children.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.000
Just the opposite is in India, just the opposite.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.200
I think that's one of the reasons why Indians

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.680
become collective very fast. It's that in childhood,

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:56.160
when we are little children or people have children,

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.440
it is regarded bad manners to take your own child

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.000
in the presence of others, absolutely bad manners.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.360
Say now, I have my daughter and when we are going to my in-laws

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.880
we couldn't take the child in my lap, you see,

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.560
except for [unclear length or so which] I was nursing the baby

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.320
so they have to say that, "Now, you better nurse."

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:25.680
I would never demand that, "Give me the child. I'll take her." Never.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:30.040
It's regarded bad manners. And now I see why it was done.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.200
It was bad manners to take the child

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.880
in the presence of others in your lap,

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.040
to say, "This is my child." It was regarded as something very rude

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.720
and ill-mannered and as if we are not from good families

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.720
and we don't know how to behave before others.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.680
And even to say that, "This is my child," was not permitted.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:58.080
We'd say that, "This is your child," to introduce your child.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.320
It's something surprising, now I am realizing it,

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:05.560
why it was so in that society of ours we are not supposed to say that,

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.440
"This is my own child." We should go anywhere and say,

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.760
"That's your child." Even the house, we would not say,

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:19.000
"This is my house," to anyone. "Will you come to your house, please?"

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:29.000
The whole -- you see the cultural background gives us that collectivity.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:34.880
Now I have told before also why people are so sex-oriented

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.440
and mainly they are so sensitive to touch another person.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.320
Anybody who touches them, they get a funny feeling. The reason is

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.040
other sensations are not developed within you.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.880
That is also because you always cuddle your own child.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.040
Child only knows the mother or the father.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.720
All the time, the child is with you.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.600
As a result of that, what happens, the child never feels

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.520
the other sublime relationships with others.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:07.760
Anybody who is the other is an identity which is something different

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.640
and when you grow up when you suddenly touch somebody

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.880
then you cannot feel the sublime things.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.360
When you are innocent, when you are a child --

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.040
I mean we never slept with our parents.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.040
I mean, it's a very common thing in India

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.200
that now supposing if I am in the house,

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.320
my daughters will give their children to sleep with Me

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:33.280
or with my husband, with brothers.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:37.800
If my brothers are there or their brothers are there

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.360
then they would give their children to sleep with them,

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.080
not with themselves.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.040
The psychological reason was that perhaps they understood it,

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.000
because it's a very traditional country, so they understood it,

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.880
that the psychological reason behind this was

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.440
that the child gets used to another man, another woman

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:01.440
and at that sublime situation, at that sublime consciousness,

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.880
when they are innocent.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.440
So the relationship of innocence is developed.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.160
Nobody feels anything funny if somebody touches you or does anything.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.320
This is the reason if you see a man touches a little boy,

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.520
he gets funny sensation, the boy gets a funny sensation.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:23.160
It's absurd because you must believe in the principle of collectivity.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:28.320
Now I have seen that, that people cuddle their children

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.720
too much in this country. And that's a very wrong thing to do,

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:37.360
all the time carry the child on your lap, carry the child on your this thing.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.040
It's too much. If you overdo it, you'll find

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.760
the same children will hate you.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.520
Because in childhood they develop a sensation

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.480
that they are overdoing the things you see and it cannot express it.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.200
Allow the child to play as much as he likes,

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.640
take the child whenever it is necessary.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.520
Let others take the child, not you.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.600
We have such a big community of Sahaja Yogis here.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.440
What I find that the mothers are carrying the child all the time

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.880
or the father is carrying the child. No, give it to other people.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.040
Let the children be with other people,

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.440
sleep with other people,

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.760
enjoy others' love and don't have fears.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:21.280
They'll love you much more. And that's how I think

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.760
we first of all built in a kind of a stigma,

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:30.000
a kind of a funny feeling that develops later on

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.800
into these perverted relationships, that they feel

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.440
that to be with another person is something wrong.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.600
All these things can be given to children in a very easy way

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.280
if you try it in childhood.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.800
Another thing is that I find like

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.600
in my husband's office I was surprised,

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.320
everybody is called by name like this and that ..

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.320
a deputy or CP is called Tom.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.200
Even the driver, we call him a Tom.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.080
But, you see, we are very particular.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.800
I mean, my husband especially is very particular.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.200
He'll never call his driver by his name,

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:05.520
"Mr," so they dare not misbehave.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.320
The relationship must be established in childhood.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.280
Like I have seen people calling him Gavin,

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.640
little children calling him Gavin. I mean, we will never call like that.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.080
Or even if you have see my grandchildren they will say,

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.320
"Gavin Uncle," at the most.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.560
It comes to more formal relationship, they'll say, "Mr Ram."

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:33.760
They won't call, "Gavin." That's not done! Aunty, uncle

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.320
? a relationship has to be established.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.040
It's not only your father and mother are important

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.280
but you snatch your children, I have seen, from others.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.680
You want to hold on to your children and just grab them all the time.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:50.080
That's why they run away from you. Overdoing it.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.440
There's no need. Children are very independent.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.200
They can look after themselves. They can manage themselves,

00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:00.200
and just to keep them pleased, you take them to shops,

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:07.440
make them buy things, get things and then they get used to it.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:15.160
You must know that child is very intelligent

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.680
and you have to bend the child's mind

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:24.040
according to your own understanding of collectivity.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.720
And if you do not do that, they'll become like all other children

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.600
who are just vagabonds. I see them.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:34.040
As I told you, once I was coming from Oxtead?

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:38.040
and there were some children about from eight to nine years of age,

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:41.800
not very big. They were from some public school ? had no discipline.

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.600
They entered into my compartment ? it was a first class compartment ?

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.480
and they had some sort of sharp things with them,

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.320
some knives maybe, or some razors.

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.840
they started rip opening all the seats for nothing at all

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.000
and they didn't do anything to Me, of course,

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.880
and I was quite worried. I said, "Why are you doing this?"

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.840
So they said, "Shut up."

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.880
So I got up, went to another compartment, and I said ?

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.840
there are some two boys who are traveling with them.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.320
They were smoking, sitting down nicely on the other side.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.680
So I went and told them these boys are doing like this.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.840
So they came back. They slapped them nicely, slapped them,

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.360
hit them, just they didn't even cry, nothing of the kind.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:25.000
They pushed them back into their places and then next station

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:28.080
came the station master came and he was saying now what to do now.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.080
You must learn to discipline your children from now.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.160
Why can't they sit in the program quietly?

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.800
What's the problem with them?

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.880
From the very beginning they must be made to feel the vibrations.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.360
They must be made to sit with other people.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.440
It's because they find that their parents are their own; the rest are not.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.320
That's how racialism also develops because they think

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.440
that other people who are not fair are not [unclear: all right].

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:09.480
All kinds of these scorpion type of temperaments,

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:13.520
the snake-like temperaments, the secretive temperaments develop

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:18.040
when you start keeping them exclusively to yourselves.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.440
On the contrary, if you allow them to be open,

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.320
talking to everyone,

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.040
opening their hearts to everyone.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:29.640
Even the people who are grown up shudder

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.880
from touching another's child, I have seen.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.440
They'll ask ten times, "Should I take the child?"

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.880
What's the harm? I mean, even if they go to anybody's house,

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.520
they'll just pick up the child.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.320
And now they say its for protection of disease and all that.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.200
But on the contrary, children develop more immunity.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:52.440
Over-protected children are very dangerously placed

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.080
because they have no immunity for anything.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.080
Imagine in that country we have all kinds of parasites living,

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.800
all kinds of parasites. Still we exist better,

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.160
because we have immunity to so many things.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:11.840
And that's how you people become very weak, health-wise.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:18.680
Imagine! I went to Australia and we had three, four Indian boys there.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.280
They came to help Me with the kitchen,

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.160
lifting all the big things here and there.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.440
So I asked one of them, I said,

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.320
"Why not ask these boys to do something?"

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.600
They said, "They are only nice to look at, Mother,

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:34.480
but they have no strength. They have no strength."

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.760
I have seen that. And it happens more in countries like England

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.800
where it's such a bad climate you keep your children inside.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.440
They don't go out. You all the time shut your children.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.000
They become selfish.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:53.520
They become very mean and very short-sighted.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.320
Open them up. Now you have a community.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.160
You have a trustworthy community.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.720
When you don't, then one person will just,

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.440
a dominating person will come up, catch hold of your child

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.720
and use that child, blackmail you for the child, do all kinds of things.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.440
But if you just allow the child to play about with everyone,

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.040
just allow, diseases will disappear.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:21.360
You'll be surprised. Also supposing you have a problem

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.000
say even with the back Agnya, if others

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.720
are handling, it disappears.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:31.360
Because somebody has better vibrations, the bhoots leave you.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.440
But if you just all the time hold,

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.440
you are a person suffering from a back Agnya yourself.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.800
You are holding on to the child yourself; the child has to suffer.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.320
We actually send our children to other people

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:49.480
in their early childhood, trusting them and they love the children

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.840
because here people don't believe that you can love the children.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.440
So here we have to trust others with our children

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.680
and that's the reason I feel the children become so exclusive,

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:03.640
they stick on to you; they cannot go to anyone.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:12.040
But you see in India when you go ? I don't know if you have visited any homes or not ?

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.360
the children will be the first to receive you.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.600
They'll say, "All right, sit down."

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.760
Then they offer you something if there's somebody is not in the house.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.680
They will look after you and they will know everything about you,

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:27.080
what you said, what you asked for, what you wanted,

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.560
everything so sweetly. Everything is on the record.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.040
And they have made it for every uncle, for every aunty,

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.200
and they remember all those things all their life.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.440
I met such children whom I had looked after in my childhood,

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.680
in their childhood I would say,

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.200
and they remembered all that I told them,

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.040
the stories I told them and how I looked after them and every little,

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.440
little things they remembered, and so sweet to know

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.320
that they know all those things still!

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.160
One of them is now working in the World Bank.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.440
She got a big job in the World Bank.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.600
She came down the other day and she just started crying

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.040
like a little baby in my lap, you see.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.440
So I said, "What's the matter?"

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.440
She said "Aunty ji," quite grown up, "I remember all those days," you see,

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:15.440
and so fond of Me, you see, that she once went to a shop

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:21.200
and she saw a sari which I used to wear the same type of sari,

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.080
yellow colored. She said, "That's my aunty's sari,"

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:28.160
and she went and bought that sari. She said, "That's my auntie's sari."

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.520
Quite grown up.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.600
All this little, little things children remember,

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:37.000
all the sublime things all the noble things,

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.840
all the things that are very pure.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.000
But you don't expose them.

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.200
You just overpower your children, too much of it.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.720
And also then the children try to attract your attention

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.440
all the time because they are used to it.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.840
They'll ask ten questions,they'll talk too much,

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:56.440
they will say things, and you will be tired.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:00.600
I know that. When I was coming by train I had a lady traveling with me.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.880
She was, her name was Clive's wife or something.

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.000
She was traveling with Me and her son.

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.840
And, poor thing, she couldn't talk to Me

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.320
because she had to tell stories to him and then this to him

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.720
and she wouldn't leave. I said, "You just neglect him.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.600
Just neglect for a while

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.160
and the child is better."

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:21.200
And the same advice I gave to Barbara. Her son is very good.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:25.040
He went to a motel with Warren when he was there.

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.440
He went to every person. He went and asked everyone.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.520
He went around the whole hall and looked at everyone.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:35.600
But in India children do that. They are worried about everyone.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.360
They will go and see their vibrations.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.040
This exclusiveness and overpowering,

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.520
you really hate your mothers

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:47.000
and hate your fathers when you grow up if they are very over-possessive.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:51.160
This is possessiveness and a fear that we'll lose the child.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.880
Actually, you will really lose if you have this kind of a fear

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.040
if and you overpower your children.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.160
That's what I have seen that children

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.040
who would like to be in the program no,

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.440
all the ladies are standing outside as punishments.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:12.000
Why? Make them sit. They'll be all right. They'll sit quietly.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.720
They won't make any noises.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.320
But this overpowering attention to your child,

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:19.440
and I have also heard that in the ashrams,

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.440
the ladies who have children don't do any work.

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.440
They just don't do any work. They are looking after the children,

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:32.440
finish, and the rest of the work in the ashram is done by somebody else.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.560
To produce a child, you don't take much.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.680
There is nothing great that you have produced the child first of all.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:44.440
They are Sahaja Yogis and they are in My trust, not in yours,

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:51.440
and don't spoil them. No mother should sit with the child in the house

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:56.480
or in the rooms, whatever may be the case.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.560
Allow the child to play with others, sit in the drawing room.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.040
But they will take the child, sit in the room,

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.760
feed the child, look after them.

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.200
They have only one work, is to look after the child, finished.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.760
It's like an emotional blackmail, I think,

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:18.320
that you just take the child to yourself and sit down there

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.720
and say that, "Oh! I am looking after the child

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.440
so the relatives say: "Oh! all right, she's a mother."

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.320
I have so many children here.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:31.320
This motherhood should not give you such a funny idea

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.160
that you have become so great

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.720
that you should sit down and do nothing else.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:41.440
My family, I have eleven brothers and sisters.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:49.600
And My mother, I think, was a President of a congress in Nagpur

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:55.440
of Madhya Pradesh. She went to jail five times

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:05.320
and a very correct woman. She wouldn't tolerate any nonsense

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.200
from her children, and that's another thing

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.440
that if the child does anything to someone ?

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.840
I have heard that children are very indisciplined, they hit others,

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:16.560
they pull the hair, they say all kinds of funny things ?

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.280
and parents never correct them, just adore them,

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:24.560
and when the children grow up they just kick out their children, the parents,

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.640
we have seen this happening.

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:33.440
Because they are realized souls. They won't like this kind of nonsense.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.680
So be careful of that. Yesterday I talked to you about Mooladhara.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.720
Let the children have a healthy, trustworthy Mooladhara.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.200
Let them meet other people, be friendly with other,

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.680
play with everyone, go round everywhere, allow them.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:53.160
But otherwise they are very negligent about their children.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.200
What do they do? They don't even massage their children;

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.320
they don't even clean their children.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:03.560
They don't keep their clothes clean. They don't give them baths regularly.

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.080
They don't give them proper food to eat.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.040
This is one point we have to see that our children

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:16.840
should be made collective and very strong in their Mooladhara

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.320
from early childhood.

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.440
And I have seen parents coming and telling me,

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:26.040
"We don't know why, why our child left us like this, you see,

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.040
when he grew up. He was all right childhood."

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:34.560
This is the reason. They get bored with you, to be very frank.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:47.080
That's the only answer. "Suddenly, you see, my son left me, suddenly.

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:50.880
Why? He was all right till yesterday.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.440
He must have been and has now run away from this place."

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.800
So they must have their own friends and they must go round

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:04.440
and it's really, comparatively if you see your children

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.840
have no wisdom of their own because the parents are so overpowering,

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.520
they don't allow children to grow in proper way,

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.080
to understand anybody else.

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.200
I just don't understand what has happened to us,

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.680
why are we going wrong with our children so much?

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.800
Now the another point one has to see about ashrams

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:33.040
which I need not have said before but now I must tell you

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:37.320
that we have to be responsible. That is also there.

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:42.160
From childhood, if you don't have sense of responsibility,

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:46.840
you can never develop into one. Like electricity bills

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:51.000
goes up like hell. People never put off their lights.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.040
I mean, there is a switch

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.320
which is to be put on and also to be put off.

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.360
It's not only for putting on.

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:04.000
Small things like gas or electricity thing,

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:07.600
if once they are in the ashram they don't bother. It's your ashram.

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:14.000
Then food, the amount of food that is thrown away

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:24.160
is something surprising. No value for food, no understanding

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:28.080
how to organize because there is no Gruha-lakshmi,

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.360
there is no house wife's qualities

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:33.480
because they are sitting with the child now, not doing anything else.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:38.800
Supposing you had your own house, then you'd be shopping,

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:42.560
you would be cooking, you would be looking after your child,

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:47.320
you would be cleaning your house, cleaning the utensils,

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:50.760
doing everything yourself. But in the ashram they think,

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:53.640
"Now we have a baby so we are in charge of the baby.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.480
Let's look after them and sit down."

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.560
I would love to play with babies all the time

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.360
and have nothing to do with you. So can I do that?

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.560
Can I do that? I cannot.

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.720
In the same way we must understand.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.880
Now we should not waste food.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:18.280
There are many people in this world who are starving.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.440
And we have no business to waste food at all.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.280
I mean on this, you would be surprised

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.800
that even the richest of richest people in India

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:33.440
would not leave anything in the plate, richest of richest.

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:38.320
And Gandhiji, in his ashram we were, even Maulana Azad,

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.720
Jawahar lal Nehru had to clean their own plates.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.800
So they should not take more. If they take more

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:52.080
they should not leave anything in such a manner that others cannot eat.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:00.760
Waste of food and waste of electricity,

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:07.200
waste of other energies, without understanding it means money.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.720
That's why you never have money.

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.040
There should be a proper organizing

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:16.080
as to what you are going to cook, what you are going to have,

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.680
how much is going to be used. Nothing should be wasted.

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:27.040
I have seen this tendency. I have seen this tendency Myself ? very common.

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:31.440
They have no respect of food, no respect of food.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:38.080
That's why children also don't have any respect for food.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:43.480
Before food is served, we must sit with the idea

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:47.600
that, "Now we are going to have food." It is a yagya.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000
And that you have to eat that food with some prayer,

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:56.680
bless that food, thank God that you have got the food.

00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:04.440
This is the Lord's prayer and then the satisfaction comes in better

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:08.600
and you get a sense that, "No, we should not waste our money

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.040
on food like this."

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:19.800
There are so many other things one has to know about children

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.160
that we must know about their vibrations.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:26.040
We should be alert about their vibrations.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:29.800
Try to find out what's wrong with them. What do they do?

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:33.440
Now, for example you find that a child is misbehaving.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:36.560
Don't go on all the time with him. Call the child.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.640
Once make the child sit down and talk to the child that,

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.200
"You shouldn't do like this.

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:46.840
When you are with your mother, pay attention to her."

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:52.680
It is you who is going to mould these new children

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.840
who have been given to you specially

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:58.640
because you are Sahaja Yogis and not to ruin their lives.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.440
You know some children have become mad

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.800
with this kind of a thing, like Dutta who was here.

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:09.040
And everybody made you see she herself was so careless,

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.440
so careless that you can't imagine

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.040
when I heard about her carelessness

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.640
and the filth with which she looked after the child,

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.480
I was amazed how Linda could do that.

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:21.800
And you should not be another Linda

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:25.640
who spoiled her child's health, mind everything.

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:29.160
If you have a clean place and a proper place,

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.440
children would love it to be there.

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:36.800
But no mother should sit with the child in the room.

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.640
That is allowed [a law?]

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:42.840
in the drawing room you can sit with your child.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:47.280
And in the room when the child is sleeping the child should be taken.

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:50.000
Otherwise keep the child in the drawing room.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:54.440
You'll see the child will become happier because it is natural to be collective.

00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:58.680
It is natural for a child to mix up with others,

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.360
to talk to others, to know about -- it's natural.

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.840
Innocence is like that.

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.760
Innocence wants to know the whole world.

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:08.720
That's the time if you don't allow the child to move

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:11.200
then he becomes perverted, he has problems.

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:18.360
So give them a better life, better situation, better education,

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.760
better discipline because you are equipped.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.360
Don't give them what you had.

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.840
This is the real love; otherwise it is possessiveness.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:32.680
I wanted to talk about this because yesterday I talked to you

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:36.520
about Mooladhara and I have been seeing and noticing

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.000
what's happening to your children

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:43.440
and I find the amount of discipline they have is coming from you,

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.800
how far you are disciplined.

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.320
And by doing this you play to their hands.

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.560
They know that they can curve you the way you like.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:53.000
They know that you are depending on them.

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.560
You can't exist without them, they have this idea.

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.280
So they don't listen to you.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:00.640
But if they know that they will lose the love if they don't behave,

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.040
they will be all right. They are very intelligent.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.760
So you must play your cards all right and see

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:12.200
that your children brought to proper line of understanding

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.640
because they are different children,

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.800
special children given to you as a trust.

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.760
They are not your children. They are my children.

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:27.760
So too much of handling and hugging and this and that is not necessary.

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.840
I mean, sometimes you break their bones the way you do.

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:38.440
It's too much. Try this on others' children,

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.880
less on your own children.

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:44.520
Try to keep your children out and love other children.

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:51.320
I don't know what kind of psychology people read but it's a simple,

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:54.440
straightforward thing. We must understand that we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.320
The children have to be collectivity;

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.800
otherwise I have to again break my head again with them

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:02.640
for being collective.They should be naturally collective.

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:12.040
I think today's speech must be written down

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:14.480
and sent to all the centers. It's important.

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:17.200
I find this all over in the western state.

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:20.440
If they have a child then they, I tell you suddenly

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.680
they become more than an emperor

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:26.480
and the wife becomes more than an emperess herself,

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:29.080
not only empress but more than an empress.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:36.200
Why, I have told you kings and queens never see their children

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.040
at all. I mean, that's another extreme.

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:15.680
Those who came from the previous meeting, please rise your hand

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:31.280
All rigth, only one.

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:40.560
I mean from the public meeting. Only one. All rigth she is all rigth.

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:44.360
Now, you see, for the people who are coming  for the first time,

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:49.720
we don't allow them, you see, to attend this --

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:57.000
what you call the puja of your Guru ?

00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:01.480
because they don't understand so well, why it is done,

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.200
why it has to be done, how it helps you and they start analyzing.

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:09.200
But if you could sit without analyzing,

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.800
as you have got your transformation,

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:13.840
all your deities within,

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:16.600
you will be strengthened and you'll feel better.

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:18.320
You don't have to do anything whatsoever.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:23.160
You have to just be quiet and just see it with understanding,

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.440
all right?

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:29.880
So that you don't get into analysis because you don't understand it.

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.440
If you try to analyze it, you'll be in trouble.

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:34.680
But if you just sit and feel the vibrations,

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:39.040
and feel the flow of the vibrations, you'll be helped, all right?

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:48.560
Now the first thing is yesterday we talked about the Mooladhara Chakra

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:53.320
and so today is Ganesha. It's not necessary to do too much of it

00:39:53.720 --> 00:40:00.280
but we could just say about the Mooladhara Chakra in English

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:07.800
and then just to pour water on My feet, that's all.

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:12.080
And then, I will vibrate these things for you

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:16.280
as we have done before and the second one

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:26.760
when we do the chanting of the Shakti, the energy of Kundalini.

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:31.000
So these things only we'll do today,

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:33.880
and I am sure yesterday the experiment

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.840
must have helped you very much to clear out your heads

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:41.160
and it has helped you to sleep well I am sure.

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:47.760
All right, and also today be attentive in the sense

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:50.480
that as you have been always in thoughtless awareness,

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.440
don't think about it. Just don't think about it.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:57.040
Just keep your mind at thoughtless awareness position

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.440
and it will work out much faster.

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:04.200
Because you are at such a level, you are at such a level

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:10.296
that it's easy now to communicate through vibrations.

00:41:10.504 --> 00:41:13.837
Otherwise it was difficult before and it's much easier.
