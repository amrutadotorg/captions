00:00.480 --> 00:03.680
Sahaja Yogi: And Her family members and Herself

00:03.880 --> 00:08.200
were the victims of considerable oppression and even jailed,

00:08.400 --> 00:13.600
at the time when … prior to British withdrawal.

00:13.800 --> 00:15.000
Two thousand years ago?

00:15.200 --> 00:16.960
Shri Mataji: So that was the calendar they started.

00:17.160 --> 00:18.080
Sahaja Yogi: That was when it started.

00:18.280 --> 00:20.520
Shri Mataji: It's very ancient, even at the time of Shri Krishna.

00:20.720 --> 00:25.480
Sahaja Yogi: It's a most ancient lineage.

00:25.680 --> 00:31.680
She's doing this spiritual work since 1970.

00:33.240 --> 00:38.560
The work She's doing is granting en-masse Self-realization

00:38.760 --> 00:41.120
to seekers of truth.

00:41.320 --> 00:46.480
There is no organization, there is no money paid.

00:46.960 --> 00:49.000
We call ourselves Sahaja Yogis.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.040
We're professional people, we're business people,

00:51.240 --> 00:53.760
we're ordinary members of the public

00:53.960 --> 00:58.600
who just conduct their lives in a perfectly normal way.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.920
And She is, I think, well known

01:01.120 --> 01:04.880
for being an outspoken critic of many of the false gurus

01:05.080 --> 01:09.520
that are purveying their ways in the marketplace today.

01:09.720 --> 01:12.520
So, She'll tell you anything you wish to know

01:12.720 --> 01:17.120
about Her message and the work that She's doing.

01:17.320 --> 01:20.120
Basically, it's to put you in touch with your spirit

01:20.320 --> 01:26.240
so that you become a master of your own Self.

01:26.440 --> 01:27.760
You don't depend upon a guru,

01:27.960 --> 01:33.880
you don't depend slavishly upon any other external influence,

01:34.080 --> 01:37.040
but you become master of your Self.

01:37.240 --> 01:39.680
So without any further introduction

01:39.880 --> 01:44.120
I'd like you to meet Mataji Nirmala Devi.

01:50.520 --> 01:54.360
Shri Mataji: Now, I think, we should have questions first.

01:54.760 --> 01:59.560
Journalist: What is Self-realization and how do You grant it?

02:01.480 --> 02:04.480
Shri Mataji: Self-realization

02:06.120 --> 02:12.120
is the epitome of our evolutionary process,

02:13.000 --> 02:15.560
which is a living process

02:15.760 --> 02:20.760
through which you achieve your higher Self.

02:21.080 --> 02:25.360
Even Darwin, who was an atheist, did say

02:25.560 --> 02:29.920
that as human beings have come so far

02:30.120 --> 02:33.040
they will achieve their absolute.

02:33.240 --> 02:37.520
So, to achieve your absolute means to get Self-realization.

02:37.720 --> 02:41.920
The purpose of our life, the meaning of our life

02:42.120 --> 02:46.560
is only achieved when we will get connected

02:46.760 --> 02:50.920
with the divine Power, which is all-pervading.

02:51.120 --> 02:54.120
Now, one need not believe in the divine Power,

02:54.320 --> 02:59.960
but you can see the manifestation of this living divine Power

03:00.160 --> 03:03.120
when you see a flower becoming a fruit.

03:03.320 --> 03:07.240
All living work is done by this divine Power.

03:07.440 --> 03:09.200
But we are not aware of it.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.720
At this human stage we are not aware of it.

03:12.920 --> 03:17.720
But once this happening takes place in your awareness …

03:17.920 --> 03:19.440
it's not just suggesting

03:19.640 --> 03:22.880
that you become something great or on … on mental level,

03:23.080 --> 03:26.840
but actualization of this experience is felt

03:27.040 --> 03:30.640
in your awareness, on your central nervous system.

03:30.840 --> 03:35.040
You can feel that you have become — again I say, you have become,

03:35.240 --> 03:38.320
not told or brainwashed, but you have become —

03:38.520 --> 03:40.920
collectively conscious.

03:41.120 --> 03:44.360
Is a state where you can feel

03:44.560 --> 03:50.400
your Self inside and others' too.

03:50.600 --> 03:54.600
Now, the knowledge of this is the knowledge of the roots.

03:54.800 --> 03:58.720
Whatever we have achieved is the knowledge of the tree.

03:58.920 --> 04:04.920
But if the tree outgrows itself from its root, then it may die.

04:05.160 --> 04:10.600
So it is time that we should find out about the roots.

04:11.040 --> 04:14.800
And to know about that, we have to become a subtler being.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.400
At this human awareness you cannot.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.960
But sometimes it challenges the ego of people.

04:21.160 --> 04:24.320
They think, "Why not? I am such and such, why shouldn't I know?"

04:24.520 --> 04:28.640
But you cannot. As you have to have a microscope

04:28.840 --> 04:35.000
to see things deeply,

04:35.400 --> 04:37.680
in the same way you have to have

04:37.880 --> 04:42.080
this new awareness within you, this dynamic awareness.

04:42.280 --> 04:48.280
Of course, the nature of Self is that it is collectively conscious,

04:49.480 --> 04:53.760
that it is the source of peace and bliss,

04:55.400 --> 04:59.280
that it is the truth and love.

04:59.720 --> 05:03.320
That's the nature. And you become that. You become.

05:03.520 --> 05:06.400
It's not only mental, but you really become.

05:06.600 --> 05:12.480
Because whatever is mental is artificial, man-made.

05:12.960 --> 05:16.520
Journalist: And do You perceive this … this collective unconscious

05:16.720 --> 05:18.760
or this collective consciousness mentally?

05:18.960 --> 05:22.080
Shri Mataji: Yes. The unconscious becomes conscious,

05:22.280 --> 05:26.720
means it comes into your central nervous system.

05:27.120 --> 05:28.840
It is within you.

05:29.040 --> 05:33.040
Everyone has said it: Christ has said it, Mohammed has said it,

05:33.240 --> 05:36.200
Buddha has said it, Mahavira has said it.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.160
Everyone has said the same thing.

05:38.360 --> 05:43.200
Like Lao-Tze, then, say, Zen system —

05:43.400 --> 05:46.680
everything has said that you are to be born again,

05:46.880 --> 05:49.680
there has to be some transformation within you.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.400
They didn't tell us lies.

05:51.600 --> 05:55.640
But the trouble is people can use this for their own purpose

05:55.840 --> 05:57.880
and mislead others.

05:58.080 --> 06:00.040
That's a different point.

06:00.240 --> 06:02.400
But logically,

06:02.600 --> 06:08.320
the disciples or the seekers also must know

06:08.520 --> 06:15.400
that you must feel your own powers, you must feel your Self.

06:15.600 --> 06:20.080
Otherwise what's the use of just following somebody

06:20.280 --> 06:21.800
where you achieve nothing of your own?

06:22.000 --> 06:25.720
What did you achieve is the main point you should see.

06:25.920 --> 06:29.720
Journalist: And how do You grant this Self-realization en masse?

06:29.920 --> 06:32.720
Shri Mataji: Yes. That's the only thing is new today,

06:32.920 --> 06:35.440
is that it can be done on mass level.

06:35.640 --> 06:39.040
That's why in India it is called as Maha Yoga.

06:39.240 --> 06:42.280
Formerly it was done for one or two persons,

06:42.480 --> 06:44.840
but now on very mass level you can do it.

06:45.040 --> 06:46.680
We had once — they were there —

06:46.880 --> 06:49.720
six thousand people in a village called Khudus.

06:49.920 --> 06:51.640
All of them got realization.

06:51.840 --> 06:54.760
In India is very easy because they are not so complicated.

06:54.960 --> 06:57.440
But Indians take it for granted.

06:57.640 --> 07:01.280
They know what Sahaja Yoga is, they know what realization is.

07:01.480 --> 07:03.080
I mean, they are trained that way,

07:03.280 --> 07:05.480
or I should say they are conditioned that way,

07:05.680 --> 07:08.560
that they understand it faster.

07:08.760 --> 07:11.960
But when the Western people get it …

07:12.160 --> 07:14.600
they are sometimes difficult,

07:14.800 --> 07:17.600
but once they get it they are very deep

07:17.800 --> 07:19.400
and they think this is the solution,

07:19.600 --> 07:22.200
the only solution for all the calamities.

07:22.400 --> 07:26.200
So they work it out very seriously,

07:26.400 --> 07:30.400
and really, they are doing very good work.

07:30.600 --> 07:35.280
Journalist: Is it harder to grant Self-realization to Westerners?

07:35.480 --> 07:39.600
Shri Mataji: I used to think so, but the other day, in Adelaide,

07:39.800 --> 07:42.840
I was amazed that they got it without any difficulty.

07:43.040 --> 07:46.040
So many of them, there must be about three hundred people in that hall,

07:46.240 --> 07:48.080
it was all packed — and they all got it.

07:48.280 --> 07:52.520
So all My ideas about that also are now changing,

07:52.720 --> 07:56.960
that suddenly I'm meeting the right type of people, I think.

07:57.160 --> 07:59.000
Journalist: But how is it that You actually

07:59.200 --> 08:01.680
give them this mass level of consciousness?

08:01.880 --> 08:05.240
Sahaja Yogi: How do You do it, Mother?
Shri Mataji: How do I do it.

08:05.440 --> 08:08.560
As I said, it's spontaneous.

08:10.800 --> 08:13.480
A seed, if you put it in the Mother Earth,

08:13.680 --> 08:16.600
it sprouts by itself. You cannot say how you do it.

08:16.800 --> 08:19.600
But … because you are just ready for it.

08:19.800 --> 08:23.040
It's like one enlightened light can enlighten another light.

08:23.240 --> 08:26.200
Even if you put your hands towards Me like this, you can get it.

08:26.400 --> 08:29.360
It's so simple. And then you can give it to others.

08:29.560 --> 08:32.960
Once you get it, you can give it to others.

08:34.360 --> 08:36.360
Journalist: And with due respect,

08:36.560 --> 08:40.360
we get a lot of Eastern visitors to Australia now,

08:40.560 --> 08:43.760
with different prayer or different types of religion.

08:43.960 --> 08:47.080
But who do we know is leading us,

08:47.280 --> 08:49.200
and who do we know is misleading us?

08:49.400 --> 08:53.960
Shri Mataji: You see, you must use your brains. For everything.

08:54.160 --> 08:58.800
God has given you a very good brain and logic.

08:59.080 --> 09:03.640
And logically, you must reach proper conclusion about your realization.

09:03.840 --> 09:06.520
First of all, you must truly find out

09:06.720 --> 09:09.760
whether you want your realization or not.

09:09.960 --> 09:12.320
Because if some people want to fly in the air,

09:12.520 --> 09:14.240
then I can't give that.

09:14.440 --> 09:17.800
If some people want to have diamonds — that I can't do,

09:18.000 --> 09:22.560
some sort of funny miracles that they do, all these tricks.

09:22.760 --> 09:25.800
So you have to be honest, first of all, about it.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.560
Secondly, you must know that this is Love of God

09:31.760 --> 09:33.760
and you cannot sell it in the market.

09:33.960 --> 09:36.400
You cannot purchase ...(unclear)

09:36.600 --> 09:39.720
That's one of a very important things one should know.

09:39.920 --> 09:42.880
Because they pamper your ego in a way

09:43.080 --> 09:46.360
that you are purchasing your guru, that he is in your pocket.

09:46.560 --> 09:48.000
That's what one feels.

09:48.200 --> 09:53.760
But you cannot pocket the guru, guru has to be higher than you.

09:54.200 --> 09:59.360
Then you have to find out the lifestyle of such a guru.

09:59.560 --> 10:04.400
How is he? How he lives? Is he an honest man?

10:04.600 --> 10:07.960
Is he a righteous person? Or is he…

10:08.160 --> 10:11.400
You must find out the credibility of such a person.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.960
Apart from that, you must find out the credibility

10:14.160 --> 10:17.400
of the followers also, what are they doing.

10:17.600 --> 10:21.560
There are so many gurus who have got followers for eighteen years,

10:21.760 --> 10:24.280
sixteen years — and they are epileptic!

10:24.480 --> 10:27.320
If the guru can't even look after their health,

10:27.520 --> 10:30.600
then what's the use of having such a guru for yourself?

10:30.800 --> 10:33.000
But human beings are very competitive

10:33.200 --> 10:35.200
in certain things, it seems.
Journalist: Sorry, really?

10:35.400 --> 10:37.880
Shri Mataji: They are very competitive, amusingly.

10:38.080 --> 10:41.320
Like, they see a person coming out of the pub, falling in the gutters,

10:41.520 --> 10:44.440
and they enter into the same pub. Sort of thing, you see.

10:44.640 --> 10:47.520
It's sort of a competition that they get into.

10:47.720 --> 10:50.200
And they think, "Why, this man has gone to this guru, so I'll go."

10:50.400 --> 10:51.560
It's a fashion!

10:51.760 --> 10:54.480
People talk, "Who is your guru?" And the other says, "This is my guru."

10:54.680 --> 10:58.000
It's … really, I can't understand how people can do that.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.440
Journalist: Yes, but, You see, it's sprung up like that.

11:00.640 --> 11:03.800
Shri Mataji: Yes. What I'm saying, this is a special time,

11:04.000 --> 11:07.200
a time of your resurrection, the time of your judgment.

11:07.400 --> 11:12.280
So, there is a need. There is a need.

11:12.480 --> 11:15.520
But people are so vulnerable

11:15.720 --> 11:17.760
and so naive, I would say, very naive,

11:17.960 --> 11:22.720
not to understand who is right and who is wrong.

11:22.920 --> 11:25.840
It's very simple. People come out of the jail,

11:26.040 --> 11:28.520
wear a funny dress and go to America,

11:28.720 --> 11:34.680
sit in a square and start singing something funny.

11:34.880 --> 11:38.200
Everybody will: "Oh, look at him, what a very great…"

11:38.400 --> 11:41.200
Moreover, a kind of a inferiority complex, I think,

11:41.400 --> 11:43.680
people have who are householders.

11:43.880 --> 11:46.800
They think they are very selfish, they are rearing their children

11:47.000 --> 11:49.640
and looking after their household. It is not.

11:49.840 --> 11:52.800
It is one of the greatest jobs, is to be properly married

11:53.000 --> 11:54.600
and to have nice children.

11:54.800 --> 11:56.960
But if you see somebody wearing that dress —

11:57.160 --> 11:59.880
he "has given up everything in the world", you see —

12:00.080 --> 12:02.240
you feel so enamored.

12:02.440 --> 12:06.120
It's superficially you cannot judge it.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.920
Journalist: Do You believe Yourself to be the (unclear)?

12:11.120 --> 12:12.160
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

12:12.360 --> 12:13.880
Journalist: I asked that, er,

12:14.080 --> 12:16.320
do You believe Yourself to be the only true Guru

12:16.520 --> 12:21.760
or are there other organizations that offer enlightenment as well?

12:21.960 --> 12:24.000
Sahaja Yogi: Do You believe that You are the only true guru

12:24.200 --> 12:27.640
and are there other organizations who offer enlightenment?

12:27.840 --> 12:29.880
Shri Mataji: There are many true gurus also in India,

12:30.080 --> 12:32.200
it's not true that I'm the only true guru.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.760
But I'm the only Mother, I should say.

12:34.960 --> 12:38.400
Because these true gurus, who are living in Himalayas

12:38.600 --> 12:43.160
and other places on the hills, don't want to come down.

12:43.360 --> 12:46.000
They don't want to mix with people.

12:46.200 --> 12:51.200
I sent one fellow with great coaxing and persuasion to America.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.440
He ran away within three days from there. He said,

12:53.640 --> 12:56.480
"They can't understand, they are just the other way round people.

12:56.680 --> 13:01.400
They can't understand God. They understand dollars."

13:02.000 --> 13:05.400
So there are many gurus. And they recognize Me quite all right.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.920
That's why when they say that "She is the …

13:08.120 --> 13:09.840
what did you say … greatest saint" or anything,

13:10.040 --> 13:13.480
is all said by these gurus, only have told them.

13:13.680 --> 13:14.600
Journalist: What about in the West,

13:14.800 --> 13:17.280
do You think that they are — gurus or not gurus —

13:17.480 --> 13:19.600
but do You think that they are of religious organizations?

13:19.800 --> 13:21.800
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, some people have taken oaths, you see.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.680
It's a good enterprise to make big money, you see.

13:24.880 --> 13:30.000
Now imagine, one guru has made six thousand crores of rupees.

13:30.200 --> 13:34.680
Now, crore is hundred and then … hundred and then … thousand…

13:34.880 --> 13:35.720
Sahaja Yogi: Sixty.

13:35.920 --> 13:37.600
Shri Mataji: Thousand and then…
Sahaja Yogi: Multi-billion.

13:37.800 --> 13:40.800
Shri Mataji: Hundred thousand and then hundred of that is one crore.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.800
So six thousand crores of rupees he has made in India alone,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.200
God knows how much in the Swiss Bank.

13:48.400 --> 13:51.120
Another one has got fifty-nine Rolls-Royces.

13:51.320 --> 13:55.520
Another one who has run away from India has purchased three aeroplanes

13:55.720 --> 13:59.480
and thirty-five Rolls-Royces.

13:59.680 --> 14:02.080
They have a special liking for Rolls-Royce, I think.

14:02.280 --> 14:06.400
Seems so. One must understand that it's a very big enterprise.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.320
Even Oberoi [owner of Oberoi Hotels] cannot afford it.

14:08.520 --> 14:10.640
Journalist: You could say it's got good knowledge of the marketplace.

14:10.840 --> 14:11.340
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

14:11.520 --> 14:13.600
Shri Mataji: Yes, they know, you see, they're very clever.

14:13.800 --> 14:16.680
Not only, they have employed people to tell them about it.

14:16.880 --> 14:19.720
You see, they have employment of, also, publicity department.

14:19.920 --> 14:23.520
They have every sort of department. I mean, it's a big enterprise.

14:23.720 --> 14:25.600
Journalist: For being a guru.
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

14:25.800 --> 14:27.400
Journalist: Being a guru is a big enterprise.

14:27.600 --> 14:28.960
Sahaja Yogi: Being a guru is a big enterprise.

14:29.160 --> 14:31.880
Shri Mataji: Very big enterprise if you can venture it, really.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.400
I mean, some English people have tried it.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.600
They have been successful, but not so much as Indians.

14:36.800 --> 14:39.480
I think Indians are clever to do that job.

14:39.680 --> 14:40.840
Sahaja Yogi: I've missed the point you were asking.

14:41.040 --> 14:42.600
Journalist: Yes, I think…
Sahaja Yogi: But she asked

14:42.800 --> 14:45.760
are there any enlightened gurus in the West.

14:45.960 --> 14:46.760
Shri Mataji: Did you?

14:46.960 --> 14:49.000
Journalist: Yeah. Are there genuine spiritual leaders in the West?

14:49.200 --> 14:50.920
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, yes, I said so, there are many.

14:51.120 --> 14:54.600
Yes, there are many. All over the world they are, not only in India.

14:54.800 --> 14:56.200
Journalist: Do You consider some of the Western

14:56.400 --> 14:59.160
religious organizations to be genuine?

14:59.360 --> 15:01.720
Shri Mataji: They are all genuine because they believe so,

15:01.920 --> 15:05.520
but they don't create genuine effects. That's the point is.

15:05.720 --> 15:08.640
You may believe something is genuine in ignorance, see?

15:08.840 --> 15:11.800
For example, you may believe that a particular diamond

15:12.000 --> 15:14.560
is a real diamond, because they're ignorant about jewellery.

15:14.760 --> 15:16.440
But when you want to sell it in the market,

15:16.640 --> 15:18.160
you find out that it's not so.

15:18.360 --> 15:21.240
That's what is happening to our religions now.

15:21.440 --> 15:26.800
The thing is, all religions have to seek within themselves

15:27.000 --> 15:31.200
and get their Self-realization. Which they are not doing.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.400
They're, too, having buildings.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.960
They, too, are having organizations.

15:36.160 --> 15:41.160
They're, too, having … what you call … big market places.

15:41.360 --> 15:43.760
All that is … all coming to economics again,

15:43.960 --> 15:47.200
or to politics at the most,

15:47.480 --> 15:50.480
but not to God.

15:52.920 --> 15:54.640
Journalist: How is it that the, er,

15:54.840 --> 15:59.040
there are gurus in the world that won't come into the West?

15:59.240 --> 16:01.600
Why do You come to the West?
Shri Mataji: Me?

16:01.800 --> 16:04.200
Sahaja Yogi: The ones that … there are many that won't come to the West.

16:04.400 --> 16:05.640
Why have You come to the West?

16:05.840 --> 16:07.280
Shri Mataji: You see, because I'm the only

16:07.480 --> 16:10.280
venturesome person, I think.

16:10.480 --> 16:12.200
Journalist: Sorry, what did You say?

16:12.400 --> 16:14.680
Shri Mataji: I said I'm the only venturesome person.

16:14.880 --> 16:18.120
But apart from that, I must tell you, it was so arranged

16:18.320 --> 16:22.480
that My husband got elected to this job in England,

16:22.680 --> 16:27.640
elected by 134 nations, four times unanimously.

16:27.840 --> 16:29.520
Journalist: What do You think …

16:29.720 --> 16:31.720
how long have You lived in the West now?

16:31.920 --> 16:34.960
Shri Mataji: No, I don't live here much, you see, I go to India also.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.000
I've been traveling quite a lot.

16:37.200 --> 16:39.120
I've been to India, I've been to all the places,

16:39.320 --> 16:41.560
and I have to go about with My husband also. I've been to Russia,

16:41.760 --> 16:46.360
I've been to China, all over the places, Argentina, every place.

16:46.560 --> 16:48.640
Journalist: Apart from the material circumstances of life,

16:48.840 --> 16:52.080
what do You think is different between the West and the East?

16:52.280 --> 16:54.920
Just forgetting the material circumstances,

16:55.120 --> 16:56.240
You know, what do You think

16:56.440 --> 16:58.040
is different about us?
Shri Mataji: Western people?

16:58.240 --> 16:59.880
Journalist: Yeah, and the Eastern people.
Shri Mataji: They are very…

17:00.080 --> 17:02.280
Sahaja Yogi: Other than material aspects.
Journalist: Yeah.

17:02.480 --> 17:05.440
Shri Mataji: No, they are very honest people, very honest.

17:05.640 --> 17:07.160
Journalist: Western?

17:07.360 --> 17:10.640
Shri Mataji: Very honest, they are very honest people.

17:10.840 --> 17:13.520
Really, they are honest, no doubt of it.

17:13.720 --> 17:17.680
And about themselves also they are very honest.

17:19.040 --> 17:20.720
I have tremendous regard for them.

17:20.920 --> 17:25.560
You see, the Indian real gurus, as you may call them,

17:25.760 --> 17:29.880
are even frightened of Indians, leave alone the Westerners, you see.

17:30.080 --> 17:33.240
They think they'll be crucified or their throats will be cut.

17:33.440 --> 17:37.000
They have been tortured also, I must say.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.320
One fellow cannot walk

17:39.520 --> 17:42.520
because his legs were broken and hands were broken.

17:42.720 --> 17:45.560
Because, you see, there is a big struggle

17:45.760 --> 17:48.440
between the reality and unreal things.

17:48.640 --> 17:51.480
Because these people are having a business proposition.

17:51.680 --> 17:52.800
You understand that.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.920
It's a very big business organization.

17:56.120 --> 18:01.040
So, if anybody says anything against it,

18:01.240 --> 18:03.840
then they can pay people to get after you,

18:04.040 --> 18:06.560
they can kill you, they can do anything they like.

18:06.760 --> 18:09.400
It's a mafia.

18:09.600 --> 18:13.560
It's not easy, to face these horrible people.

18:14.080 --> 18:17.080
They are all multimillionaires.

18:19.480 --> 18:21.640
Journalist: Have You suffered similar experiences

18:21.840 --> 18:23.200
and people try to kill You or…

18:23.400 --> 18:27.360
Shri Mataji: They try, but doesn't succeed.

18:27.560 --> 18:30.440
Yesterday only we had a meeting and there were two boys

18:30.640 --> 18:34.520
from this TM, I think paid by TM, whatever it is.

18:34.720 --> 18:36.560
They tried to be very funny.

18:36.760 --> 18:41.360
And I'd say the whole public got after them; they ran away.

18:41.560 --> 18:44.160
They said, "Now you can't have it, dog-in-the-manger policy

18:44.360 --> 18:47.000
you have got. Now you can't have it, so let us have it at least."

18:47.200 --> 18:49.440
So they went away.

18:49.640 --> 18:53.960
They try. It's all right. I mean, I expect all that.

18:54.160 --> 18:57.800
Journalist: Can You just tell us something if the … Your …

18:58.000 --> 19:03.200
Your yoga school is developed from…

19:03.400 --> 19:06.280
Sahaja Yogi: It's not a yoga school.
Journalist: No, it's…

19:06.480 --> 19:10.600
Sahaja Yogi: You get your realization, and you then become a person

19:10.800 --> 19:14.240
who becomes a realized person. And you just…

19:14.440 --> 19:18.120
Journalist: But it has started from … through the influence of…

19:18.320 --> 19:20.280
Sahaja Yogi: Yes. Not influence.

19:20.480 --> 19:22.560
I got my realization when I went to India.

19:22.760 --> 19:24.800
I've been looking. I've been to all these false gurus,

19:25.000 --> 19:27.880
all these places where I saw some shocking things happening,

19:28.080 --> 19:31.440
and I … absolutely shocked and disillusioned.

19:31.640 --> 19:34.440
I was about to come home, but somebody had given me

19:34.640 --> 19:38.160
Mataji's telephone number. She was in India at that time from England.

19:38.360 --> 19:39.880
And I went to Her and I thought,

19:40.080 --> 19:41.680
"My goodness, this is all so very different."

19:41.880 --> 19:45.600
I was starting to feel incredibly peaceful and joyful,

19:45.800 --> 19:47.920
and amazing things were happening inside me,

19:48.120 --> 19:50.120
which were very … very wonderful,

19:50.320 --> 19:53.080
and it all seemed so normal. And yet so…

19:53.280 --> 19:55.400
Shri Mataji: And healthwise. First of all he improved healthwise.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.040
Journalist: What was your trade…

19:57.240 --> 19:59.720
Sahaja Yogi: I'm a doctor. I mean, I was very skeptical…

19:59.920 --> 20:02.360
Journalist: General practitioner?
Sahaja Yogi: No, I've trained as such,

20:02.560 --> 20:04.640
but I've been practicing in natural health

20:04.840 --> 20:07.480
because I'm a bit disillusioned with the medical side.

20:07.680 --> 20:09.960
And many of my patients had been going to India

20:10.160 --> 20:13.320
on these spiritual pilgrimages — and coming back worse.

20:13.520 --> 20:15.720
And I wondered why. Because I was reading all these books

20:15.920 --> 20:17.600
that were saying these great gurus

20:17.800 --> 20:19.880
and they were speaking about Christ, and Mohammed,

20:20.080 --> 20:21.760
and Krishna, and all these things.

20:21.960 --> 20:24.040
And they were coming back in a worsened condition.

20:24.240 --> 20:26.440
So I thought the two things were a disparity.

20:26.640 --> 20:29.120
On the one hand, they seemed to be those spiritual masters.

20:29.320 --> 20:31.280
On the other hand, these people were coming back.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.200
But they had a very good rationalization,

20:33.400 --> 20:35.520
they'd say they were purifying themselves,

20:35.720 --> 20:37.280
or they were cleansing themselves,

20:37.480 --> 20:40.200
or they were going through some karmas, or something like that.

20:40.400 --> 20:41.760
So I couldn't sort it all out.

20:41.960 --> 20:44.440
So I went to India. I stayed there a few months.

20:44.640 --> 20:45.960
And finally I met Mother.

20:46.160 --> 20:50.120
And it seemed so logical, and so sensible, and so scientific.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.400
I mean, it agrees with all the medical science.

20:52.600 --> 20:54.400
It underpins medical science, in fact.

20:54.600 --> 20:56.560
Shri Mataji: I've also studied medicine.

20:56.760 --> 20:58.960
Sahaja Yogi: It was quite incredible. And now it just seems so easy.

20:59.160 --> 21:00.720
Journalist: So you do some yoga practice

21:00.920 --> 21:02.880
as part of your daily routine day?

21:03.080 --> 21:05.120
Sahaja Yogi: Meditation in a very simplified form.

21:05.320 --> 21:07.360
When you feel this cool vibration on your hand,

21:07.560 --> 21:09.080
and above your head, and over your body,

21:09.280 --> 21:11.200
you know that you are in meditation.
Shri Mataji: You are in meditation.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.280
Sahaja Yogi: That's it. That's it.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.160
Journalist: Do you do any sort of asanas or you just…

21:14.360 --> 21:17.560
Sahaja Yogi: Not many. Just a few if you got a specific problem.

21:17.760 --> 21:20.000
Shri Mataji: You see, it depends on. It's very scientific.

21:20.200 --> 21:22.080
It depends on where you have a problem.

21:22.280 --> 21:24.880
Say, for example, you have a problem in your stomach.

21:25.080 --> 21:28.280
Now, you have to do certain exercise for that,

21:28.480 --> 21:31.120
for a short time, till you get rid of it.

21:31.320 --> 21:34.600
Or may be that you have to say certain mantras for that,

21:34.800 --> 21:38.160
to excite, or to awaken, that part within you

21:38.360 --> 21:40.040
into liveliness.

21:40.240 --> 21:41.800
That's how … it is very scientific.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.360
But gradually you'll know it, so easy it becomes,

21:44.560 --> 21:46.320
the whole thing becomes so easy.

21:46.520 --> 21:51.160
Because when you are expanding towards the periphery,

21:51.360 --> 21:53.120
the whole thing becomes complex.

21:53.320 --> 21:56.120
But when you integrate towards the center,

21:56.320 --> 21:57.680
then everything is very simple,

21:57.880 --> 21:59.960
you have to deal with simple principles.

22:00.160 --> 22:03.640
And once you know how to manage that… for example, balance.

22:03.840 --> 22:06.520
Balance in a person is very important.

22:06.720 --> 22:09.000
Balance in a person is not dealt with

22:09.200 --> 22:12.520
in, say … in medical science.

22:12.720 --> 22:14.120
While we have one medical science,

22:14.320 --> 22:16.520
then we have psychologists, we have this and that.

22:16.720 --> 22:20.160
We have one doctor for one eye and another doctor for another eye.

22:20.360 --> 22:22.480
Here, it's one person,

22:22.680 --> 22:27.000
who is the one who cures you,

22:27.200 --> 22:28.720
he diagnoses you,

22:28.920 --> 22:31.400
he gives you realization — is everything.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.960
The laboratory, the complete instrument is human being.

22:34.160 --> 22:38.400
And this is created by God within you beautifully, it's all there.

22:38.600 --> 22:41.880
Just to be connected to the mains, that's all.

22:42.080 --> 22:43.280
It's all ready there.

22:43.480 --> 22:46.240
I mean, nothing fantastic for Me, because I know it is there.

22:46.440 --> 22:49.920
But once you get it, you are amazed how you have started working it out.

22:50.120 --> 22:53.400
Because we are not aware of ourselves.

22:54.840 --> 22:57.840
Every one of you can get it. Every one of you.

22:58.040 --> 23:00.320
Journalist: How did You develop the Self-realization,

23:00.520 --> 23:01.840
were You born with it or…

23:02.040 --> 23:03.640
Shri Mataji: I was born with it.

23:03.840 --> 23:06.200
Journalist: So, from the day You were born You knew it?

23:06.400 --> 23:08.160
Shri Mataji: Yes. Yes.

23:08.360 --> 23:12.000
Journalist: When did You know it that You have been born with it?

23:12.200 --> 23:13.760
When did You discover it?

23:13.960 --> 23:15.720
Shri Mataji: You see, it is like if I ask you a question

23:15.920 --> 23:17.960
when did you discover you are a human being.

23:18.160 --> 23:19.760
You won't be able to say.

23:19.960 --> 23:24.040
It's as simple as that, you see. I was quite aware of it.

23:24.240 --> 23:26.480
Journalist: When You say Self-rea— I mean, I know I'm a human being.

23:26.680 --> 23:28.520
I mean, what do You mean by Self-realization here?

23:28.720 --> 23:30.080
Shri Mataji: You can, everyone can get it.

23:30.280 --> 23:33.000
As long as you are a human being, you get it, that's all.

23:33.200 --> 23:36.040
Sahaja Yogi: It's a higher level of awareness than human awareness.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.120
You're not using your thinking brain.

23:38.320 --> 23:40.320
You're not using your emotional brain.

23:40.520 --> 23:44.760
You're using what is basically the all-pervading Power of God,

23:44.960 --> 23:46.400
the unconscious, about which Jung…

23:46.600 --> 23:47.920
Shri Mataji: That is reflected within you.

23:48.120 --> 23:49.760
Sahaja Yogi: Jung spoke about it.
Shri Mataji: You see,

23:49.960 --> 23:53.960
it is reflected within you as Kundalini, we call it.

23:54.160 --> 23:56.800
In Sanskrit language it is called as Kundalini.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.840
But this also word is so terrifying to people,

24:00.040 --> 24:02.480
those who have read about Kundalini; they get a fright.

24:02.680 --> 24:05.920
She is your Mother, the one who has to give you the rebirth.

24:06.120 --> 24:08.920
Now, there are people who have written so many such big books,

24:09.120 --> 24:11.720
without knowing where the Kundalini lies.

24:11.920 --> 24:13.960
Imagine. Absolutely vain.

24:14.160 --> 24:16.960
Now, you can see it in some people, pulsation of the Kundalini.

24:17.160 --> 24:20.280
We have got also on videotapes some of these things

24:20.480 --> 24:23.720
when we saw on some people, where there was obstruction,

24:23.920 --> 24:25.760
the pulsation goes out.

24:25.960 --> 24:27.760
The pulsation, you can see sometimes

24:27.960 --> 24:32.000
this triangular bone, sacrum, just pulsating.

24:32.200 --> 24:37.640
But imagine, this thing was called as sacrum, means sacred.

24:37.840 --> 24:39.960
And I asked the Greek people;

24:40.160 --> 24:42.080
I said, "Why did you call it sacrum?"

24:42.280 --> 24:48.080
They said, "We had a rapport with the Indo-Aryan group,

24:48.280 --> 24:50.320
much before Alexander went to India,

24:50.520 --> 24:55.400
and they told us that this bone is the sacred bone."

24:57.600 --> 24:59.280
Sahaja Yogi: If you burn the bone,

24:59.480 --> 25:03.240
the bone is so ossified that it's the last one to burn.

25:03.440 --> 25:07.720
Shri Mataji: Yes, you need a very high temperature to burn that bone.

25:08.200 --> 25:11.160
Journalist: I'll ask: You worked with Gandhi, didn't You?

25:11.360 --> 25:13.640
What were Your impressions of Gandhi?

25:13.840 --> 25:15.200
Shri Mataji: What are My impressions?

25:15.400 --> 25:16.080
Journalist: Yeah.

25:16.280 --> 25:17.800
Shri Mataji: Oh, he was a very great man,

25:18.000 --> 25:19.920
very much needed at that time.

25:20.120 --> 25:23.080
And if he had survived, he would have supported Sahaja Yoga

25:23.280 --> 25:24.760
out and out, no doubt about it.

25:24.960 --> 25:25.920
Journalist: Sorry?

25:26.120 --> 25:27.480
Shri Mataji: If he had survived,

25:27.680 --> 25:31.440
he would have supported Sahaja Yoga out and out.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.080
Journalist: How much contact did you have with Gandhi?

25:36.280 --> 25:39.880
Shri Mataji: It's quite a lot. As a child I was very close to him,

25:40.080 --> 25:42.160
and he used to call Me Nepali.

25:42.360 --> 25:44.760
Because according to My features were more Nepali,

25:44.960 --> 25:48.640
My complexion was Nepali, he used to call Me Nepali.

25:48.840 --> 25:52.000
And very affectionate towards children. Very affectionate.

25:52.200 --> 25:54.520
Otherwise he was a hard-task master himself,

25:54.720 --> 25:56.960
towards himself and towards others,

25:57.160 --> 26:02.320
but very kind gentleman as far as the children were concerned.

26:02.520 --> 26:05.600
And you could even overrule him by sweetness.

26:05.800 --> 26:08.760
I mean, supposing he says, "I don't want to have any juice just now."

26:08.960 --> 26:10.680
You can say, "Bapu, have a little bit,

26:10.880 --> 26:14.440
otherwise we won't have," or something. He would just melt away.

26:14.640 --> 26:16.120
So sweet inside.

26:16.320 --> 26:17.680
Journalist: Have You seen the film version of him?

26:17.880 --> 26:19.800
Shri Mataji: Yes, I've seen it.
Journalist: What do You think of it?

26:20.000 --> 26:22.440
Shri Mataji: Film is very good, I must say. It's very good.

26:22.640 --> 26:24.840
Journalist: Is it accurate?
Shri Mataji: Yes, very.

26:25.040 --> 26:28.040
It is very accurate, but in some ways,

26:28.240 --> 26:32.120
you see, I would say that …

26:32.320 --> 26:35.600
for example, Gandhiji, you see, was an Indian.

26:35.800 --> 26:37.360
And the Indian style of talking

26:37.560 --> 26:40.000
is rather different from what you people talk.

26:40.200 --> 26:44.240
Because you are very intelligent people and you're sharp-witted,

26:44.440 --> 26:46.880
you see; you know words, I mean, you are very well read,

26:47.080 --> 26:50.240
so you say few things in a very sharp way,

26:50.440 --> 26:54.480
immediately you answer in a way that is …

26:54.680 --> 26:58.880
very, I should say, acute, absolutely.

26:59.080 --> 27:02.440
But he was an Indian, so the Indian, you see,

27:02.640 --> 27:06.720
doesn't say such a … such … sudden …

27:06.920 --> 27:12.440
he just springs with such a sudden intelligent remarks, you see.

27:12.640 --> 27:15.320
They are gentler people, I think.

27:15.520 --> 27:18.880
They speak in a gentler way, in a little roundabout way.

27:19.080 --> 27:20.760
Sahaja Yogi: He couldn't sit on the floor properly.

27:20.960 --> 27:22.080
Shri Mataji: That also you could find out

27:22.280 --> 27:24.280
that he couldn't sit properly on the floor.

27:24.480 --> 27:26.160
That's why— but that's not so important.

27:26.360 --> 27:28.760
What I felt was the only thing…
Journalist: He did in the film.

27:28.960 --> 27:30.160
I'm not a critic, he did in the film.

27:30.360 --> 27:31.920
Shri Mataji: That's one thing about him,

27:32.120 --> 27:34.080
and the essence of it is, you see,

27:34.280 --> 27:38.800
that whatever was — which was such a short time

27:39.000 --> 27:41.960
to bring forth such a deep thing —

27:42.160 --> 27:44.240
I think he has done full justice.

27:44.440 --> 27:48.760
Except for one point that Gandhiji never wanted to provoke.

27:48.960 --> 27:52.400
He never used these sinister methods of provoking others.

27:52.600 --> 27:56.240
He was a very genuine person, you see.

27:56.440 --> 28:00.080
And I think that is little bit lacking.

28:00.280 --> 28:02.520
He didn't do it to … just to, you see …

28:02.720 --> 28:06.480
with a mind that would provoke others.

28:06.680 --> 28:09.160
No, he wouldn't think of such a thing.

28:09.360 --> 28:13.240
It was just he thought that if he … has no other way out.

28:13.440 --> 28:15.240
Because you don't know what times we had.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.360
I mean, in this picture he couldn't show anything.

28:17.560 --> 28:19.160
It was very oppressive time.

28:19.360 --> 28:22.400
For three hundred years, can you believe?

28:22.600 --> 28:25.640
So to talk of anything was impossible.

28:25.840 --> 28:27.960
My father himself went to jail many a times.

28:28.160 --> 28:30.120
My mother went five times to jail.

28:30.320 --> 28:33.080
Of course, later on he was Member of the Constituent Assembly,

28:33.280 --> 28:34.480
Parliament, everything.

28:34.680 --> 28:37.240
My brother is also a Minister of Steel now

28:37.440 --> 28:39.640
in India, in the Cabinet.

28:39.840 --> 28:45.840
But that time, it was so difficult, very difficult.

28:46.520 --> 28:49.880
They used to torture people much more than is shown there.

28:50.080 --> 28:53.640
Individually. They used to hound out.

28:53.840 --> 28:55.320
Journalist: Do You know Mrs. Gandhi?

28:55.520 --> 28:56.960
Shri Mataji: Oh, yes, I like her.

28:57.160 --> 28:59.040
Journalist: Do You ever met her personally?

28:59.240 --> 29:01.400
Shri Mataji: Yes, I've met her once or twice.

29:01.600 --> 29:04.920
But I wonder if she remembers Me now.

29:05.560 --> 29:07.240
You see, she is a very busy person.

29:07.440 --> 29:11.320
I mean, she is a solution just now for us, we can say.

29:11.520 --> 29:13.200
Journalist: What do You think are the immediate problems

29:13.400 --> 29:15.240
facing India at the moment?

29:15.440 --> 29:18.400
Shri Mataji: If they take to Sahaja Yoga, they can be all solved

29:18.600 --> 29:22.000
because it also gives you material freedom.

29:22.200 --> 29:24.960
It also gives you material blessings.

29:25.160 --> 29:27.920
You see, we have too much black magic and all that in our country.

29:28.120 --> 29:30.760
It's very heavy (…).

29:30.960 --> 29:35.720
And once you get into those things, you get the poverty.

29:37.080 --> 29:39.160
Journalist: Just on that point, Mother,

29:39.360 --> 29:41.760
a couple of years ago in an interview You were more talking

29:41.960 --> 29:45.520
about Self-realization and less inclined to talk about

29:45.720 --> 29:48.400
so-called group miracle cures and so on.

29:48.600 --> 29:50.520
I noticed in the press release

29:50.720 --> 29:53.560
there's quite a heavy accent on cures.

29:53.760 --> 29:55.640
Have You done that specifically,

29:55.840 --> 29:58.960
to perhaps reinforce Your message or get Your message across?

29:59.160 --> 30:00.440
Shri Mataji: Which one?

30:00.640 --> 30:02.680
Sahaja Yogi: He is saying that there seems to be an emphasis

30:02.880 --> 30:05.840
in the press release on curing.

30:06.040 --> 30:08.320
Shri Mataji: No, no, I did not. Did you feel that way?

30:08.520 --> 30:10.400
Oh God, I'm not doing that. Really.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.520
Sahaja Yogi: "Has Your emphasis changed?" is his question.

30:12.720 --> 30:14.880
Journalist: What I'm saying is that I gather that two years ago

30:15.080 --> 30:16.560
that You weren't emphasizing it…

30:16.760 --> 30:18.200
Shri Mataji: No, no, no. No, never, never, never.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.640
Journalist: … but the press release that supports Your trip here

30:20.840 --> 30:25.960
indicates the more … other side of it,

30:26.160 --> 30:28.840
which, of course, has opened a little more skepticism.

30:29.040 --> 30:31.000
Shri Mataji: Curing, it is a by-product. Curing is a by-product

30:31.200 --> 30:32.560
of Self-realization.

30:32.760 --> 30:35.320
You see, Self-realization is most important.

30:35.520 --> 30:39.240
You see, God is not interested in curing every Dick, Tom and Harry.

30:39.440 --> 30:42.720
Say, for example, Hitler wants to get cured. Should we cure him?

30:42.920 --> 30:44.920
It's better cure for him to go to hell,

30:45.120 --> 30:47.440
at least for one lifetime,

30:47.640 --> 30:52.080
and then come back, to see what people have suffered.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.200
So, it's never … accent is never on curing at all,

30:57.400 --> 31:00.840
and I, out of compassion —

31:01.040 --> 31:03.080
you see, because it works — I work out.

31:03.280 --> 31:06.320
But this isn't important. I don't know why you felt that way.

31:06.520 --> 31:08.440
I don't know what they have given you. I have no idea

31:08.640 --> 31:11.640
as to what they have given you and what is accentuated,

31:11.840 --> 31:13.080
but as far as I am concerned,

31:13.280 --> 31:17.080
for Me Self-realization is the main thing. That's My job.

31:18.160 --> 31:21.520
Sahaja Yogi: In fact, Mother takes emphasis away from curing

31:21.720 --> 31:22.760
at the public programs.

31:22.960 --> 31:24.560
Shri Mataji: I tell them not to cure anyone.

31:24.760 --> 31:28.120
I said, if they want to cure, let them work on My photograph.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.680
Let the photograph take all the load.

31:29.880 --> 31:31.800
You don't take any load of curing.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.680
Journalist: Perhaps then You better talk over

31:33.880 --> 31:36.360
the situation with your public relations people.

31:36.560 --> 31:37.400
Sahaja Yogi: We don't have any.

31:37.600 --> 31:39.720
Shri Mataji: Any. We don't have any publicity, nothing.

31:39.920 --> 31:41.800
They do it on their own, spontaneously.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.880
They will realize if they have made mistake,

31:44.080 --> 31:46.120
then put it right next time.

31:46.320 --> 31:49.800
I don't know what's happening and all that. I don't know anything.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.960
They are doing on their own. Let them learn.

31:52.160 --> 31:53.640
They gradually learn, you see.

31:53.840 --> 31:56.560
Better ways of healing and all that.

31:56.760 --> 31:59.360
Let them learn. They'll all learn.

31:59.560 --> 32:01.160
Journalist: Can we just clarify that:

32:01.360 --> 32:05.280
do You claim that You can heal or cure?

32:05.480 --> 32:08.480
Shri Mataji: I do not claim, I do it.

32:08.800 --> 32:10.560
No question of claiming, you see.

32:10.760 --> 32:15.200
I do it. I've done it. You can do it also.

32:15.400 --> 32:18.720
Everyone can do it. This Doctor Warren has done.

32:18.920 --> 32:20.760
He's cured so many people.

32:20.960 --> 32:23.560
Journalist: You've just said it could be done through photograph.

32:23.760 --> 32:24.760
Could You explain that?

32:24.960 --> 32:26.560
Shri Mataji: Yes, it is surprising, you know.

32:26.760 --> 32:28.760
Myself I was surprised, as you are,

32:28.960 --> 32:31.120
that My photograph has also got vibrations

32:31.320 --> 32:33.520
and people get cured with photographs.

32:33.720 --> 32:38.360
In your country only when I came, the press was very kind to Me.

32:38.560 --> 32:41.960
The reason was there was a lady who was sick with coma.

32:42.160 --> 32:44.160
And they said she had got blood…

32:44.360 --> 32:46.200
Sahaja Yogi: Cerebral aneurism.

32:46.400 --> 32:47.360
Shri Mataji: Aneurism.

32:47.560 --> 32:51.400
And one another disciple of Mine

32:51.600 --> 32:54.000
took My photograph, put it under her head.

32:54.200 --> 32:57.560
And she started getting all right,

32:57.760 --> 33:00.120
in the sense that she started opening her eyes.

33:00.320 --> 33:02.400
So the doctors got frightened. They said,

33:02.600 --> 33:05.240
"Even if she gets all right, she will be damaged.

33:05.440 --> 33:06.760
She won't be able to walk."

33:06.960 --> 33:09.640
But today she's perfectly all right. Not only that,

33:09.840 --> 33:13.920
but she is very hard-working Sahaja Yogini. So it's all right.

33:14.120 --> 33:16.720
Journalist: How does it work? When you (…) the photograph.

33:16.920 --> 33:19.800
Sahaja Yogi: How does it work? How does it work from the photograph?

33:20.000 --> 33:22.480
Shri Mataji: From the photograph?

33:22.680 --> 33:26.560
The photograph is a real image of Myself, you see.

33:26.760 --> 33:29.480
And this My body has got a coefficience

33:29.680 --> 33:31.400
which emits vibrations.

33:31.600 --> 33:35.160
Same happens with the photograph.

33:35.360 --> 33:37.680
That, too, has the same coefficience.

33:37.880 --> 33:40.560
Of course, it hasn't got the other dimension,

33:40.760 --> 33:42.760
but it also emits the vibrations

33:42.960 --> 33:47.320
because of the coefficience being the same.

33:47.520 --> 33:49.960
Say, even if you take Christ's photograph — it's not real,

33:50.160 --> 33:52.800
because it's all come out of the unconscious, all right,

33:53.000 --> 33:54.840
but there's a lot of imagination put into.

33:55.040 --> 33:58.760
Any photograph if you take of any person, it is like that.

33:58.960 --> 34:02.160
But there are so many things I've seen which are …

34:02.360 --> 34:05.600
which have come out of the Mother Earth. They emit vibrations.

34:05.800 --> 34:10.280
Like, Stonehenge in England has vibrations.

34:10.480 --> 34:12.120
So many places like that have vibrations,

34:12.320 --> 34:16.720
but not so strong as Mine, because I am a living person.

34:19.080 --> 34:22.800
Journalist: What is Your idea of God? What is God?

34:23.000 --> 34:24.200
Shri Mataji: My idea?

34:24.400 --> 34:28.600
It's not only idea, but it's the truth that I feel about God.

34:28.800 --> 34:31.800
God …

34:33.680 --> 34:36.680
is …

34:37.520 --> 34:41.400
difficult to put Him in words, isn't it?

34:42.400 --> 34:45.400
Is the witness

34:45.600 --> 34:49.680
of the play of His Power.

34:50.920 --> 34:54.160
He is separated from His Power,

34:54.360 --> 34:58.040
and He's just witnessing the play of His Power.

34:58.240 --> 35:02.280
And the Power is creating,

35:03.000 --> 35:06.840
is protecting, nourishing the creation,

35:07.040 --> 35:09.520
and evolving it.

35:09.720 --> 35:14.960
Till this play is up to the animal stage,

35:15.160 --> 35:18.480
everything is under the control.

35:18.760 --> 35:22.840
But to give it a greater freedom,

35:26.000 --> 35:30.280
they have to give first freedom to human beings at this level.

35:30.480 --> 35:32.480
So this freedom was granted.

35:32.680 --> 35:35.480
So that you learn what is your mistake,

35:35.680 --> 35:38.600
what is your right thing; you decide.

35:38.800 --> 35:41.200
You develop yourself with that.

35:41.400 --> 35:44.040
You create a balance within yourself.

35:44.240 --> 35:48.320
And then you ascent to the spirit,

35:48.520 --> 35:52.760
by which you know God's power flowing through you.

35:52.960 --> 35:56.760
This is all the game is. In short I'm telling you.

35:56.960 --> 36:01.080
So this God is the witness of this play.

36:01.280 --> 36:05.920
He is the Father, we can say, and His power is the Holy Ghost.

36:06.120 --> 36:11.400
And He sends His Son on this Earth to redeem people.

36:11.600 --> 36:14.920
He plays a very important part, Christ, in our lives.

36:15.120 --> 36:16.920
And all other Incarnations.

36:17.120 --> 36:20.440
All of them have a meaning — and a place within ourself.

36:20.640 --> 36:23.080
Christ also has a special place within us,

36:23.280 --> 36:27.240
which is the gate of the limbic area.

36:30.440 --> 36:34.160
Journalist: So You are a Christian, as well as being an Indian?

36:34.360 --> 36:35.800
Shri Mataji: Oh, I'm not a Christian,

36:36.000 --> 36:39.440
in the sense that I don't belong to any Church.

36:39.640 --> 36:43.400
Neither I'm a real Hindu, Christian, everything.

36:43.600 --> 36:48.720
Because they are all based on the same principle of God.

36:48.920 --> 36:52.080
See, these are all flowers

36:52.560 --> 36:55.560
who were …

36:58.280 --> 37:04.280
on the same tree of life.

37:05.720 --> 37:07.240
But people plucked it, saying,

37:07.440 --> 37:10.840
"This is mine. I am that. I am that."

37:11.040 --> 37:15.040
And then the flowers became ugly —

37:16.720 --> 37:19.440
and dead.

37:19.640 --> 37:22.240
That's why people think Christianity has failed you,

37:22.440 --> 37:24.880
Hinduism has failed you, Islam has failed you.

37:25.080 --> 37:28.280
It's not the Prophets. It's not the Incarnations.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.680
It's we — by possessing them.

37:30.880 --> 37:32.520
We cannot possess God.

37:32.720 --> 37:35.720
We cannot possess religion, we are in religion.

37:35.920 --> 37:40.520
Means religion is our valency.

37:40.720 --> 37:44.640
Just like carbon has valency of four, we have valency of ten.

37:44.840 --> 37:49.320
That is in this part of our being, where the attention is.

37:49.520 --> 37:52.920
And if we are balanced people, if we live with moderation,

37:53.120 --> 37:54.880
the ascending was fast.

37:55.080 --> 37:58.800
But even the extremists of extremists have got realization.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.600
So the grace is flowing

38:01.800 --> 38:04.800
very generously, I should say, to achieve that.

38:05.000 --> 38:09.040
Even alcoholics, you see, who come to Me — in alcoholic state —

38:09.240 --> 38:12.400
become overnight wonderful people.

38:12.600 --> 38:13.640
Journalist: Overnight?

38:13.840 --> 38:16.320
Shri Mataji: Overnight, you'll be surp— overnight.

38:16.520 --> 38:18.680
There are druggists and chemists and smokers.

38:18.880 --> 38:20.920
Journalist: (…).

38:21.120 --> 38:22.560
Journalist: Can You cure me of smoking?

38:22.760 --> 38:23.720
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

38:23.920 --> 38:25.080
Journalist: Can You cure me from nicotine?

38:25.280 --> 38:28.280
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes.

38:31.160 --> 38:35.760
Journalist: Do You consider Yourself to be a saint or a prophet?

38:35.960 --> 38:38.240
Shri Mataji: What is the relevance of this question?

38:38.440 --> 38:39.440
Journalist: Well…

38:39.640 --> 38:41.000
Shri Mataji: I just don't understand.

38:41.200 --> 38:43.880
Everyone of them are asking, "Do you consider?"

38:44.080 --> 38:47.400
If I was not considering Myself, why would I work like this?

38:47.600 --> 38:49.160
Do I think I'm a thief?

38:49.360 --> 38:52.520
Or what I think of Myself? You see, it's a funny question, isn't it?

38:52.720 --> 38:54.720
You just tell Me. I don't understand the relevance.

38:54.920 --> 38:57.520
Because everyone of them are asking these questions to Me:

38:57.720 --> 38:59.880
"Do you think?" It's a— what is it?

39:00.080 --> 39:02.960
I must be thinking something about it, I must be aware of Myself,

39:03.160 --> 39:05.640
otherwise I won't take up this work.

39:05.840 --> 39:08.520
See now: I have a husband who loves Me very much,

39:08.720 --> 39:11.520
I have a very comfortable house of My own,

39:11.720 --> 39:14.520
I have My own children and grandchildren.

39:14.720 --> 39:17.240
I don't get anything out of this for Me,

39:17.440 --> 39:20.840
except that I have a satisfaction that I'm sharing My joy

39:21.040 --> 39:22.680
with all of you. All right?

39:22.880 --> 39:24.960
Now, unless and until I'm aware of Myself,

39:25.160 --> 39:26.720
do you think I will do such a thing?

39:26.920 --> 39:31.800
Anyone of you will do this thing without getting anything out of it?

39:32.000 --> 39:37.240
Can anyone in this world can do such a thing? Tell Me.

39:37.440 --> 39:39.680
Without any purpose?

39:39.880 --> 39:41.600
Journalist: Well, I think somebody's just called You

39:41.800 --> 39:43.080
the greatest living saint and…

39:43.280 --> 39:45.240
Shri Mataji: Yes. I mean, they can call Me anything, you see.

39:45.440 --> 39:48.160
But what I'm saying — that, you see …

39:48.360 --> 39:51.080
asking this question … supposing I said, "Yes, I think so."

39:51.280 --> 39:53.960
Then you'll say, "She is very ego-oriented." All right.

39:54.160 --> 39:57.080
If I say, "I don't think so," then suggest, "She's diffident."

39:57.280 --> 39:59.240
You see, it's a very funny thing, you know.

39:59.440 --> 40:02.680
So it's like a … this is a question that is irrelevant.

40:02.880 --> 40:07.680
Unless and until I am aware of it, why will I do this work?

40:08.560 --> 40:10.320
Journalist: I suppose, in the West we think of saints

40:10.520 --> 40:12.640
with halos around their head, you see.

40:12.840 --> 40:15.400
Shri Mataji: Yes, you can see that also if you become realized souls.

40:15.600 --> 40:18.400
You do. You will see that. Many see that.

40:18.600 --> 40:21.800
I will show you one photograph. Have you got that? Let us see it.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.840
YOGINI: This is a nice one.
Sahaja Yogi: Ah, there. That one.

40:25.040 --> 40:27.120
Shri Mataji: Just see this photograph. Can you explain?

40:27.320 --> 40:28.040
Journalist: Sorry?

40:28.240 --> 40:31.520
Shri Mataji: This photograph. I'm sitting in a village, outside.

40:31.720 --> 40:34.880
And this … seven times this light fell on Me.

40:35.080 --> 40:37.880
Have you seen Christ pray in that garden?

40:38.080 --> 40:39.120
Journalist: Oh yes, yes.

40:39.320 --> 40:41.800
Shri Mataji: And this is the photograph. See now.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.880
There are many other things people have seen in My photographs.

40:45.080 --> 40:47.760
There's one photograph where they have seen

40:47.960 --> 40:50.240
lights coming out of My fingers, My toes.

40:50.440 --> 40:54.600
They have got these photographs. So for you…

40:55.080 --> 40:57.120
Journalist: Couldn't that just be a reflection from a glass

40:57.320 --> 40:58.440
or something like that?
Shri Mataji: No, no.

40:58.640 --> 41:02.000
This has happened seven times and when I put down My head.

41:02.200 --> 41:06.200
None of them could see at that time. It's not through a reflection.

41:06.400 --> 41:09.080
Ask the photographer if she can explain.

41:09.280 --> 41:10.720
Sahaja Yogi: We had the expertation.

41:10.920 --> 41:14.760
Shri Mataji: All artificial gurus would try this trick, you see.

41:15.520 --> 41:17.600
Journalist: I understand You began

41:17.800 --> 41:22.600
teaching Self-realization of people in 1970? Is that right or…

41:22.800 --> 41:25.640
Shri Mataji: No, not Self-realization. I had "human-realization".

41:25.840 --> 41:26.840
Journalist: Right.

41:27.040 --> 41:30.280
Shri Mataji: I understood human beings at that time.

41:30.480 --> 41:33.120
They are very complicated, I must say.

41:33.320 --> 41:36.000
So many permutations and combinations.

41:36.200 --> 41:40.040
And I had to study them thoroughly.

41:41.240 --> 41:45.520
Because My father himself was a realized soul and he told Me

41:45.720 --> 41:48.720
that "No use talking about God, saying anything about Him —

41:48.920 --> 41:51.560
it will become another Bible, another Gita.

41:51.760 --> 41:57.760
You have to find out a mass realization method.

41:58.400 --> 42:00.440
It has to work on masses."

42:00.640 --> 42:02.760
And also you have seen any discovery

42:02.960 --> 42:07.040
which is not used for masses is wasted.

42:07.240 --> 42:10.080
And he said, "Otherwise, same thing will happen.

42:10.280 --> 42:12.760
You will be crucified or they'll kill you. You'll be finished."

42:12.960 --> 42:17.040
Then I knew I had come for this work, to achieve that.

42:17.240 --> 42:22.080
So I had to study, work it out,

42:22.280 --> 42:27.400
the method by which en-masse evolution could be achieved.

42:27.600 --> 42:31.400
And when I did it, I would say it was My human-realization,

42:31.600 --> 42:37.600
in the sense that I found an opportune time to start.

42:43.480 --> 42:45.720
Journalist: Will You continue to do this travel around the world

42:45.920 --> 42:48.000
until You die or…
Shri Mataji: What is it?

42:48.200 --> 42:50.080
Sahaja Yogi: Will You continue to travel around the world

42:50.280 --> 42:53.280
doing this work until You die?

42:53.840 --> 42:55.720
Shri Mataji: It's very futuristic.

42:55.920 --> 42:59.040
I don't think of My death so far.

42:59.240 --> 43:02.160
As long as I can do, I'll do it, but …

43:02.360 --> 43:04.640
I mean, if some … these people are realized,

43:04.840 --> 43:07.320
then, I think, they'll give Me some rest sometime, isn't it?

43:07.520 --> 43:11.840
I must also have some rest. Now I am sixty years of age.

43:12.040 --> 43:15.800
How long do you want Me to live? It's for you to decide.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.600
If you take over, then I need not live.

43:19.800 --> 43:22.680
Journalist: You spend more … most of the time in London now, do You?

43:22.880 --> 43:25.520
Shri Mataji: Yes. Because My husband is there, My family…

43:25.720 --> 43:29.320
And he is a very busy man himself, you see, he is a…

43:29.520 --> 43:31.680
Journalist: Where did You come from originally in India?

43:31.880 --> 43:32.760
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

43:32.960 --> 43:34.640
Journalist: Where did You live originally in India?

43:34.840 --> 43:37.080
Shri Mataji: Originally, near Ahmednagar.

43:37.280 --> 43:39.360
It's the where the … our dynasty…

43:39.560 --> 43:42.360
Journalist: I mean, of big cities where … is that near a big city?

43:42.560 --> 43:45.920
Shri Mataji: It's a … it's a … district place,

43:46.120 --> 43:48.720
it's not a very big city, Ahmednagar. It's very near…

43:48.920 --> 43:51.240
Journalist: What is the biggest city it's near? Or…

43:51.440 --> 43:54.280
Shri Mataji: I lived in … with My husband in Delhi

43:54.480 --> 43:57.960
because he was with the former prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri.

43:58.160 --> 43:59.920
He was his secretary.
Journalist: Ahh.

44:00.120 --> 44:03.480
Shri Mataji: Yes. And then I lived … he went to Tashkent also with him.

44:03.680 --> 44:06.760
He was throughout with him. And then I lived in Bombay

44:06.960 --> 44:09.640
because he was Chairman of Shipping Corporation of India.

44:09.840 --> 44:12.040
For years together I lived in cities.

44:12.240 --> 44:15.240
I studied in Lucknow, in Lahore, in Medical College.

44:15.440 --> 44:17.080
That's how I lived in cities.

44:17.280 --> 44:19.760
But originally, My family,

44:19.960 --> 44:22.320
all of them come from this place, Ahmednagar.

44:22.520 --> 44:25.440
I was born in a small little hill station,

44:25.640 --> 44:29.640
which is on the tropic of Cancer.

44:33.480 --> 44:35.800
Journalist: Mother, what about reincarnation?

44:36.000 --> 44:39.160
Is that part of Your philosophy?

44:39.360 --> 44:42.320
Sahaja Yogi: Is reincarnation part of Your philosophy?

44:42.520 --> 44:44.200
Reincarnation.

44:44.400 --> 44:45.680
Shri Mataji: Of whom?

44:45.880 --> 44:47.680
Journalist: Of everybody.

44:47.880 --> 44:51.760
When we physically pass away, do we return (…)?

44:51.960 --> 44:54.080
Shri Mataji: Yes. Are you mean … you mean human beings?

44:54.280 --> 44:55.040
Journalist: Yes.

44:55.240 --> 44:57.400
Shri Mataji: Of course, of course, of course. Of course.

44:57.600 --> 45:00.800
Journalist: Perhaps then You could look at another situation,

45:01.000 --> 45:02.800
one of the mysteries of life. There are many people

45:03.000 --> 45:05.760
who appear to be honest, sincere and work hard,

45:05.960 --> 45:08.120
who suffer enormous tragedy and so on.

45:08.320 --> 45:12.360
And there are people — I could name a couple but I won't —

45:12.560 --> 45:14.720
who seem to flow through,

45:14.920 --> 45:17.440
but they're not necessarily liked by their mate,

45:17.640 --> 45:19.520
You know, by their fellow human beings.

45:19.720 --> 45:21.880
Is there a reason for that, perhaps attached spirits

45:22.080 --> 45:23.360
or something like that?

45:23.560 --> 45:26.000
Shri Mataji: Going to false gurus is very dangerous,

45:26.200 --> 45:29.480
is extremely dangerous. It's not so superficially to be treated.

45:29.680 --> 45:31.000
You see, money I don't mind.

45:31.200 --> 45:33.800
Because if they are thugs, all right, there are so many thugs.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.320
We have mafia, we have all kind of things.

45:36.520 --> 45:38.840
It doesn't matter, let them be thugs.

45:39.040 --> 45:42.480
But it's not so simple as we think. It's very deep.

45:42.680 --> 45:46.760
You see, they can bring forth all the diseases

45:46.960 --> 45:49.080
which are incurable within us.

45:49.280 --> 45:52.200
Say, myelitis … what you call … osteomyelitis,

45:52.400 --> 45:55.400
cancer,

45:55.840 --> 45:58.520
heart attacks — all kinds of diseases

45:58.720 --> 46:01.800
which are absolutely incurable, beyond our control.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.720
Then depressions, and then stresses within us…

46:05.920 --> 46:07.880
also they can bring …

46:08.080 --> 46:12.480
quite a lot of them give epilepsy to people, abnormal behavior.

46:12.680 --> 46:15.080
Even in the plane if I am sitting, you see,

46:15.280 --> 46:18.360
I find some people are just doing like this, like that.

46:18.560 --> 46:20.840
And most of them have been to this TM.

46:21.040 --> 46:24.480
They have paid thousands and thousands of pounds

46:24.680 --> 46:29.360
to achieve that kind of a funny thing, burning this center,

46:29.560 --> 46:31.440
by which their necks come out like that

46:31.640 --> 46:35.440
and they are all the time twitching themselves or jumping.

46:35.640 --> 46:38.640
Sahaja Yogi: He asked about spiritual possession too, Mother.

46:38.840 --> 46:40.560
He asked about spiritual possessions.

46:40.760 --> 46:42.840
Shri Mataji: Of course, this is spiritual possession.

46:43.040 --> 46:46.600
Yes it is spiritual possessions. They become…

46:46.800 --> 46:49.800
Journalist: And did You have a method of driving away that spirit?

46:50.000 --> 46:52.720
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, I do. I do try. You see, even…

46:52.920 --> 46:55.280
Journalist: So that's the key to solving many of these diseases.

46:55.480 --> 46:57.440
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, of course, of course. Because, you see,

46:57.640 --> 47:01.320
the cabbages are better sometimes than these people.

47:01.520 --> 47:03.480
Poor things! You know, they are so suppressed

47:03.680 --> 47:05.800
that even if you show them a garlic,

47:06.000 --> 47:07.640
they are frightened and they tremble like this.

47:07.840 --> 47:10.320
Garlic, can you imagine? They are afraid of garlics

47:10.520 --> 47:13.280
and afraid of onions. I mean, what are their myths?

47:13.480 --> 47:18.080
Some are just sex-points, without any sex activity.

47:18.360 --> 47:20.640
Horrible things they are!

47:20.840 --> 47:24.520
They are neither human beings nor animals.

47:24.960 --> 47:28.800
Terribly possessed, no doubt.

47:29.400 --> 47:31.480
They can be cured, absolutely.

47:31.680 --> 47:34.320
We have cured so many like that. You can meet so many …

47:34.520 --> 47:37.840
you won't believe them that they have been like that.

47:38.040 --> 47:41.200
There's one gentleman here, standing, you can see him…

47:41.400 --> 47:44.480
Sahaja Yogi: He was a flyer in TM.

47:45.680 --> 47:47.920
Journalist: What's a flyer?
Sahaja Yogi: Who can levitate.

47:48.120 --> 47:49.960
Shri Mataji: You see, all they levitate, so-called.

47:50.160 --> 47:53.120
Sitting on the floor you have to jump, you see.

47:53.320 --> 47:56.400
And then you think that you are flying. And then you get possessed.

47:56.600 --> 48:00.080
And they just start … sitting down they just come out of their seats,

48:00.280 --> 48:03.720
you see, as if somebody had ejected them out.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.080
This is supposed to be flying.

48:07.280 --> 48:08.680
Journalist: Do You (…)?

48:08.880 --> 48:09.960
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

48:10.160 --> 48:12.560
Journalist: You ruined his theory, didn't You?

48:12.760 --> 48:15.320
Shri Mataji: Oh, horrible things they do.

48:15.520 --> 48:20.880
In one of our ashrams, one fellow came

48:21.080 --> 48:25.920
because he went to a barbershop and he was having a …

48:26.120 --> 48:28.240
so he had to spend some time waiting outside.

48:28.440 --> 48:32.400
So he saw one magazine there, where it was written about Sahaja Yoga,

48:32.600 --> 48:35.600
in a magazine called Yoga Today.

48:35.800 --> 48:38.280
They are not supposed to read anything else, you see.

48:38.480 --> 48:41.720
They are banned. Everything is secret. It's all mafia style.

48:41.920 --> 48:44.640
So poor man, you see, hesitatingly took that thing,

48:44.840 --> 48:47.520
and he took that Yoga Today to read.

48:47.720 --> 48:50.840
And there was My picture which said that "If you feel cool breeze

48:51.040 --> 48:54.120
on this picture, then know that you are a realized soul."

48:54.320 --> 48:55.680
So he tried to put the hands,

48:55.880 --> 48:58.720
and in the barbershop hall he went into contortions.

48:58.920 --> 49:02.320
So he got such a fright that he telephoned to our ashram,

49:02.520 --> 49:06.000
and the gentleman who was on the phone

49:06.200 --> 49:09.160
was also … not a TM but another type;

49:09.360 --> 49:12.120
and he asked him, "Are you feeling hot?"

49:12.320 --> 49:13.880
He said, "I'm boiling this side."

49:14.080 --> 49:17.040
He said, "Have you done TM?" He said, "Yes. But how do you know?"

49:17.240 --> 49:19.680
He said, "We know." Then he came down.

49:19.880 --> 49:23.280
But when he came down there … and these people just took My name,

49:23.480 --> 49:25.400
and the fellow went into such a contortion

49:25.600 --> 49:27.560
and started barking like a dog

49:27.760 --> 49:30.080
that all the Sahaja Yogis got a fright,

49:30.280 --> 49:33.720
and they sent Me a SOS that "Mother, please come to our help!"

49:33.920 --> 49:36.480
And I was going to have big … lots of people for dinner.

49:36.680 --> 49:38.160
I said, "What's it happening?"

49:38.360 --> 49:40.600
He said, "There's a fellow who came here, he's behaving like this,

49:40.800 --> 49:43.040
and we are all frightened of him."

49:43.240 --> 49:45.480
Then I told them what is to be done to pacify him.

49:45.680 --> 49:48.960
But this fellow today is a very big Sahaja Yogi in London.

49:49.160 --> 49:54.360
He was a manager of a very big estate company.

49:54.560 --> 49:56.840
He lost his job, lost his money.

49:57.040 --> 50:01.080
He became penniless doing this TM.

50:05.960 --> 50:09.200
But now I am told this Rajneesh is coming to your Australia

50:09.400 --> 50:12.400
to bless you all.

50:12.800 --> 50:15.960
This fellow Rajneesh, who is ousted from America…

50:16.160 --> 50:17.480
Sahaja Yogi: The orange people, they're called.

50:17.680 --> 50:20.800
Shri Mataji: The orange people. He is trying to come here,

50:21.000 --> 50:22.200
so be careful.

50:22.400 --> 50:24.240
Sahaja Yogi: The government's already typing up its regulations now.

50:24.440 --> 50:26.000
Shri Mataji: He's bought only thirty-six Rolls-Royces

50:26.200 --> 50:27.240
and three aeroplanes.

50:27.440 --> 50:30.680
I don't know what his ambitions are out of Australians.

50:30.880 --> 50:33.680
Sahaja Yogi: He's been thrown out of India. Now that he got a dep—

50:33.880 --> 50:35.160
Shri Mataji: Not thrown out, he ran away.

50:35.360 --> 50:39.880
Sahaja Yogi: He'd run away, sorry. He had a deportation order in America now.

50:40.080 --> 50:43.080
We hear this coming through.

50:43.520 --> 50:44.680
Journalist: What's his name?

50:44.880 --> 50:46.080
Sahaja Yogi: Rajneesh.

50:46.280 --> 50:48.640
Shri Mataji: These orange people, you see.

50:48.840 --> 50:51.160
Journalist: What is bad about Rajneesh?

50:51.360 --> 50:53.440
Shri Mataji: Horrible.

50:53.640 --> 50:55.440
Journalist: But why?

50:55.640 --> 50:59.880
Shri Mataji: You see, what he does: he makes you into a sex-point.

51:00.080 --> 51:03.840
He has mass sex. Mass sex, you see. Horrible things.

51:04.040 --> 51:05.640
Journalist: Some people think that's all right.

51:05.840 --> 51:09.280
Shri Mataji: Yes, those who like it go there and become mad, that's all.

51:09.480 --> 51:11.880
That's all. You pay for it.

51:12.080 --> 51:14.960
We have a film. I think we have a film. We can show you.

51:15.160 --> 51:18.480
See, somebody has taken secretly the film of his work.

51:18.680 --> 51:20.480
Sahaja Yogi: One of them, who is disenchanted.

51:20.680 --> 51:24.480
Shri Mataji: One of them. He took a secret film of what they do inside.

51:24.680 --> 51:29.080
And that was released in London, called as "God Who Ran Away".

51:29.280 --> 51:32.000
And in that they showed this mass thing and all that.

51:32.200 --> 51:35.120
So what he does: he makes people absolutely impotent.

51:35.320 --> 51:37.280
They become impotent by his method.

51:37.480 --> 51:41.400
Possesses them at the sex point. And talks about sex all the time.

51:41.600 --> 51:45.320
So they are so restless that they become mad.

51:45.520 --> 51:48.320
And they give him money as much as he wants, you see.

51:48.520 --> 51:51.560
He has told so many women that he was their husband

51:51.760 --> 51:54.760
in his previous lives. So they gave all their ornaments to him.

51:54.960 --> 51:59.080
One Indian lady gave all her jewellery to him,

51:59.280 --> 52:00.720
very expensive jewellery.

52:00.920 --> 52:05.800
So his brother and his … her … she was a widow.

52:06.000 --> 52:10.280
Her brother and brother-in-law came to Me with her,

52:10.480 --> 52:13.400
that "Please, Mother, cure her." I asked her, "Why did you give?"

52:13.600 --> 52:16.480
She said, "He was my husband in his previous life."

52:16.680 --> 52:18.800
I said, "Who told you?" She said, "He told me."

52:19.000 --> 52:21.880
I said, "But why do you believe?" She said, "I also feel the same way."

52:22.080 --> 52:24.800
I said, "But what about the husband whom you married,

52:25.000 --> 52:28.440
from whom you have children, who has given you all this jewellery?

52:28.640 --> 52:30.920
And why should you give it to this man, whom you never married?"

52:31.120 --> 52:32.560
"No, I believe what he said."

52:32.760 --> 52:37.280
She was absolutely in complete possession of him.

52:37.480 --> 52:41.360
And no one knows where she is now. No one knows.

52:41.560 --> 52:44.800
Journalist: There is … sorry … there are some other cults in Australia,

52:45.000 --> 52:47.400
and (…) would probably including the Moonies

52:47.600 --> 52:50.720
and the Hare Krishnas. What are Your opinions on them?

52:50.920 --> 52:52.840
Shri Mataji: Now, Moonies, of course, you know all very well.

52:53.040 --> 52:54.840
I need not tell about them.

52:55.040 --> 52:56.520
Journalist: You don't approve the Moonies?

52:56.720 --> 52:58.000
Shri Mataji: Of course not.

52:58.200 --> 53:02.480
You see, when you become a Sahaja Yogi, you start loving your parents,

53:02.680 --> 53:07.800
loving your children, loving everyone. You solve your problems.

53:08.000 --> 53:12.760
You don't hate anyone. You don't run away from anyone.

53:12.960 --> 53:16.760
On the contrary, if these things happen, this is anti-God activity,

53:16.960 --> 53:19.000
absolutely anti-God activity,

53:19.200 --> 53:21.640
that you get out of your families completely,

53:21.840 --> 53:23.800
you have nothing to do with anyone.

53:24.000 --> 53:25.720
This is absolutely anti-God.

53:25.920 --> 53:31.920
The another sect is our great, what you call them, Hare Ramas.

53:32.720 --> 53:35.600
And the first basic mistake they make

53:35.800 --> 53:39.000
is to say that vegetarianism is just way to God.

53:39.200 --> 53:41.520
Taking Krishna's name, specially.

53:41.720 --> 53:44.280
Because Shri Krishna, in Gita,

53:44.480 --> 53:48.560
the first chapter — is very outset —

53:48.760 --> 53:52.600
He told Arjuna that "You have to kill."

53:52.800 --> 53:56.440
Human beings, leave alone animals.

53:56.640 --> 53:59.800
Then he said, "How can I kill! Because there are my gurus

54:00.000 --> 54:01.720
and there are my relations!"

54:01.920 --> 54:04.000
So He said, "You have to kill them.

54:04.200 --> 54:08.920
To achieve a higher goal, you have to give up your lower goals."

54:09.120 --> 54:11.680
This is what exactly He told.

54:11.880 --> 54:16.040
Then later on it was introduced, in the Gita,

54:16.240 --> 54:20.200
that vegetarianism leads you to God. I don't know how.

54:20.400 --> 54:21.680
Because they said

54:21.880 --> 54:25.440
that the people who are left-sided, emotional people,

54:25.640 --> 54:30.840
eat more meat, which is scientifically not true.

54:31.080 --> 54:35.520
Those who are morbid people, those who are left-sided —

54:35.720 --> 54:39.920
means who have got … what you can say … conditioned people —

54:40.120 --> 54:41.560
they seldom eat meat.

54:41.760 --> 54:44.600
The people who eat meat are the rajasic people,

54:44.800 --> 54:47.920
are the people who are more aggressive, more active.

54:48.120 --> 54:50.520
So the inactive people eat less meat

54:50.720 --> 54:54.040
because protein acts as an activity.

54:54.240 --> 54:56.440
So it's scientifically also.

54:56.640 --> 54:58.680
But they don't understand science or anything, you see.

54:58.880 --> 55:04.440
These people are told that "You must not eat meat."

55:04.640 --> 55:06.400
Finished. That's the end of a way.

55:06.600 --> 55:10.920
Now, in India, out of poverty, so many people are not eating meat.

55:11.120 --> 55:14.640
By not eating meat if you go to God, then everybody else was wrong —

55:14.840 --> 55:18.800
because Krishna Himself used to eat and Rama Himself ate.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.880
Even Buddha ate it, because He died … because He died …

55:22.080 --> 55:24.240
Journalist: Buddha ate meat?
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

55:24.440 --> 55:26.760
Journalist: Ate … ate meat?
Shri Mataji: Yes, He ate.

55:26.960 --> 55:32.200
And He died because He ate a raw — by mistake — a raw meat

55:32.400 --> 55:35.760
of a … pig.

55:35.960 --> 55:38.600
Or a wild boar, just wild boar. Of a wild boar.

55:38.800 --> 55:41.720
So, He was eating. And in India

55:41.920 --> 55:44.680
only the so-called Brahmins don't eat, so-called Brahmins.

55:44.880 --> 55:48.160
Because they thought this is the best way of befooling people.

55:48.360 --> 55:51.960
But not that I am for eating meat or eating vegetables.

55:52.160 --> 55:55.680
It depends on your temperament, what sort of a temperament you have.

55:55.880 --> 56:00.600
Supposing you are very aggressive — it's better to eat vegetables.

56:00.800 --> 56:03.960
Journalist: Carrots.
Shri Mataji: Yes. Grass.

56:04.640 --> 56:07.360
But if you are non-aggressive

56:07.560 --> 56:10.280
and you get conditioned very easily, suppressed type,

56:10.480 --> 56:12.720
then you better eat meat.

56:12.920 --> 56:14.920
Sahaja Yogi: I'm afraid we're going to have to finish it there.

56:15.120 --> 56:17.840
Those that want to, you can see Mother privately and …

56:18.040 --> 56:20.560
for an interview if you want to.

56:20.760 --> 56:24.560
That can be arranged later. So, can we wind it up? Are there any…

56:24.760 --> 56:26.560
Shri Mataji: On one point I'll say about them

56:26.760 --> 56:31.400
that what these people are doing in India is something so shocking.

56:31.600 --> 56:36.920
I went to many places, in the district places,

56:37.120 --> 56:40.560
and the people like you, the newspaper people, came and said,

56:40.760 --> 56:43.600
"Mother, why are You carrying these people in the villages here?

56:43.800 --> 56:46.680
We have had enough of them." I said, "Why? What happened?"

56:46.880 --> 56:49.440
They said, "We have so many beggars now let loose.

56:49.640 --> 56:53.000
These people are now walking in the villages, you see, and begging.

56:53.200 --> 56:55.320
And they are torturing everyone there.

56:55.520 --> 56:58.280
Because our villages don't have so much money to look after them.

56:58.480 --> 57:00.360
In the beginning, of course, they tried."

57:00.560 --> 57:02.520
And they all bombard Me with questions

57:02.720 --> 57:05.560
that "Why do you carry these people? They'll also come here as beggars."

57:05.760 --> 57:08.080
I said, "No, they are all employed people.

57:08.280 --> 57:11.640
They are not beggars, don't be worried." They can't believe it.

57:11.840 --> 57:13.720
They said, "Now, first they came as aggressors

57:13.920 --> 57:16.640
and now they are coming as beggars and troubling us.

57:16.840 --> 57:18.560
And a person is begging at your house."

57:18.760 --> 57:20.920
Journalist: Is that the hippies?
Shri Mataji: Yes.

57:21.120 --> 57:24.720
The hippies and these, also these Hare Ramas.

57:24.920 --> 57:26.360
This is their special job.

57:26.560 --> 57:29.120
And you said that … you see, they say they are saints.

57:29.320 --> 57:31.800
So they said, "We can't even eat our food properly,

57:32.000 --> 57:34.960
because they are standing at your doorstep asking for alms, you see.

57:35.160 --> 57:38.480
Whatever we have we give them: 'Baba, save us from your problems!'"

57:38.680 --> 57:39.760
Journalist: It's like they play reverse

57:39.960 --> 57:41.240
(…), isn't it?
Shri Mataji: Yes. Imagine!

57:41.440 --> 57:44.160
And they think they are leading a very sane life, you know.

57:44.360 --> 57:45.840
For only eating vegetarian food,

57:46.040 --> 57:48.600
they think they are very sane people.

57:48.800 --> 57:50.840
God's people are never beggars.

57:51.040 --> 57:54.160
They must have self-esteem and self-respect.

57:54.360 --> 57:58.960
If they feel insulted, then they should give up this profession.

57:59.720 --> 58:01.920
Sahaja Yogi: OK, those that want to see Mother further, see Ian,

58:02.120 --> 58:03.480
he's at the back there.

58:03.680 --> 58:08.640
And we'll take it step further then. Thank you very much.

58:08.840 --> 58:10.040
Journalist: Thanks very much for Your time.

58:10.240 --> 58:12.200
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much all of you. Thank you very much.

58:12.400 --> 58:13.640
I hope you convey the message

58:13.840 --> 58:15.680
so that many people get their realization

58:15.880 --> 58:17.840
and you don't have any more diseases,

58:18.040 --> 58:19.560
anything left in this country.

58:19.760 --> 58:21.440
Sahaja Yogi: Let them know that Mother is speaking tonight

58:21.640 --> 58:25.440
and tomorrow night and Thursday night at the exhibition hall,

58:25.640 --> 58:28.960
exhibition buildings in Melbourne.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.440
And She gives the experience at the program.

58:32.640 --> 58:36.400
Shri Mataji: It acts. The main thing is it acts.

58:36.600 --> 58:38.120
Sahaja Yogi: She actually gives the experience

58:38.320 --> 58:39.600
of Self-realization at the program.

58:39.800 --> 58:42.800
Shri Mataji: Yes, I will, I will, there.

58:43.360 --> 58:46.800
It has to act. That's the difference between others and Me, at least.

58:47.000 --> 58:50.840
That much one can see clearly. It immediately changes you.

58:51.040 --> 58:53.600
Yesterday we had one cancer patient of liver.

58:53.800 --> 58:55.440
We should follow it, that case up.

58:55.640 --> 58:57.440
Now, doctors have told him, "Within one month

58:57.640 --> 59:01.320
you are going to die," you see. And I told him, "All right."

59:01.520 --> 59:04.680
I made him sit with his left hand towards Me and right hand outside.

59:04.880 --> 59:08.360
He started feeling much better. And healthier.

59:08.560 --> 59:10.840
And if he is cured, that's a proof.

59:11.040 --> 59:14.640
Sahaja Yogi: And it's happened many times, under medical supervision.

59:14.840 --> 59:18.080
Shri Mataji: I've also cured our president, Mr. Sanjiva Reddy.

59:18.280 --> 59:19.800
If you want, you can write to him and find out.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.760
He is cured of his cancer.

59:21.960 --> 59:24.480
Journalist: Where is that person that had cancer

59:24.680 --> 59:25.640
that you saw in Australia?

59:25.840 --> 59:28.960
Shri Mataji: Here in Adelaide. He came only yesterday,

59:29.160 --> 59:31.400
and he felt very much better after that.

59:31.600 --> 59:33.280
So many people felt better.

59:33.480 --> 59:37.440
Some people had stomach trouble, and some people had frozen arms…

59:37.640 --> 59:39.560
Everybody felt better.

59:39.760 --> 59:42.920
Their arms opened out, automatically.

59:43.120 --> 59:44.560
Journalist: When You claim cures like that,

59:44.760 --> 59:48.000
do You get flak from the medical profession and…

59:48.200 --> 59:49.600
Sahaja Yogi: When You claim cures like that,

59:49.800 --> 59:51.880
do the medical profession oppose You?

59:52.080 --> 59:54.600
Shri Mataji: No, I have many doctors who are My disciples now.

59:54.800 --> 59:56.920
Many doctors. You see, there are so many things still left

59:57.120 --> 01:00:00.000
to the doctors to do. I'm not interested in patients.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.520
But if they come to My program, they get all right.

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.640
I'm not (…), I don't go to hospitals.

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:06.720
Sahaja Yogi: It challenges too much, challenges too much

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:08.080
within our fabric of knowledge.

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:10.160
Shri Mataji: No, but they won't be angry with Me, I'm sure,

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:13.040
because they are overloaded with patients.

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:15.000
They won't be so angry, I can assure you.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.760
They won't be so angry.
Journalist: That's very true.

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.680
Shri Mataji: You see, I'm not interested in curing,

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:22.880
but they take … if they get cured, what should I do?

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:26.440
Automatically they get cured.

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:28.800
Sahaja Yogi: Certainly the people that develop their realization

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.480
get better. That's not … there's no question about.
