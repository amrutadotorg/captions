1
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:29,875
Today, we are going to worship the Maha Lakshmi

2
00:05:29,917 --> 00:05:40,417
which I think is very much worshipped in this country where they worship Her as Maria

3
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:46,542
and also there’s a swayambu of Maria, you must have seen.

4
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:53,959
And also there was an apparition of Her. First I never believed that it could be,

5
00:05:53,959 --> 00:06:00,291
but then after feeling the vibrations, now I know it was true,

6
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,917
that She did appear here in an apparition.

7
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:08,667
She appeared before Me, also, you must have seen, in a photograph.

8
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:22,792
This is the principle by which you have risen to this state.

9
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:30,417
The central path of your ascent is created by Maha Lakshmi power

10
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:33,750
for the Kundalini to rise.

11
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:38,125
In the temple of Maha Lakshmi in Kholapur

12
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:42,041
they always sing the song of “Ude, Ude, Ambe.”

13
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:48,375
So I asked the people there, “Why do you sing Ambe’s song

14
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:52,333
in Maha Lakshmi’s temple?” So they said that,

15
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:59,667
“We don’t know why we do it, but is it wrong?” I said, “No,

16
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:08,417
because only in the Maha Lakshmi channel Kundalini can rise

17
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:15,000
and Kundalini is the Umba.” That’s how, you see, they understood

18
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:19,500
and they were really amazed that I explained it very well

19
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:23,375
‘cause from ancient times this song has been sung there

20
00:07:23,417 --> 00:07:26,375
and they never knew why this song is sung.

21
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:36,583
Coming to the point of Maha Lakshmi, we have to understand

22
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:48,709
what does it do, what it’s help is that this Maha Lakshmi channel or the Maha Lakshmi’s powers have created within us

23
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:58,500
a proper balance, a proper route for Kundalini to rise.

24
00:07:58,542 --> 00:08:04,208
Left and right has been balanced and She is the one who creates

25
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:13,250
and makes a wider path for Kundalini to rise.

26
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:24,083
This is the path of compassion and love. Through that compassion and love

27
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:30,959
She creates this path because She knows that if the path is not wide enough

28
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,250
the Kundalini cannot rise.

29
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:43,000
Ultimately, one reaches a state where you start seeking and when you start seeking,

30
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:46,375
your Maha Lakshmi principle has been awakened.

31
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:54,709
That is awakened and sometimes it is very strong. Then you start seeking in a mad way.

32
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,792
I am sorry to say that many

33
00:08:56,792 --> 00:09:00,625
are already lost in seeking, but there are so many

34
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:06,875
who have now come to the right path and to the right ascent.

35
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:11,417
Another thing this Maha Lakshmi principle does

36
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:18,000
is to allow the Kundalini’s power to go to different chakras also.

37
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:23,417
To make a way to different chakras and corrects all the chakras.

38
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:31,999
She is a very flexible force, I should say, which guides the Kundalini into different chakras

39
00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:37,750
and She understands which chakra needs the help of the Kundalini.

40
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:42,834
So you must have seen that when the Kundalini rises how She pulsates,

41
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:48,542
where She goes, where She shows the need is of your awakening.

42
00:09:48,542 --> 00:10:00,792
All this works out because She is full of compassion and love

43
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:03,999
that you should get your absolute truth.

44
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,208
We have many problems as it is, you know, in Sahaja Yoga

45
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,917
because when people are ascending they carry on with them

46
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:19,542
some of their past stones and they cannot climb.

47
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:24,750
They try then they fall, they try then they fall, then they go up again, they fall.

48
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:32,500
But today I’m going to tell you about what is the state one has to achieve.

49
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:41,667
As Shri Krishna has said it in the “Gita,” describes Sitha Pragya,

50
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:45,792
the second chapter, but it’s very difficult to understand Him,

51
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:48,250
He is not so clear cut as your Mother is.

52
00:10:48,291 --> 00:11:01,500
So people don’t understand what He is saying. And they ask the question,

53
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:08,542
“How, how do you reach that state of Sitha Pragya? How do you get to that stage?”

54
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:12,500
But Ganeshwara, when he wrote his “Ganeshwari,”

55
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:18,458
he called it as the Sahaja Stithi, means the state of Sahaj.

56
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:32,709
He didn’t call Sitha Pragya. He called it as Sahaja Stithi, meaning the state of Sahaj.

57
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:40,333
So he describes the Sahaj in a very beautiful manner and very subtle.

58
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:44,166
Of course, Ganeshwara also, very few people understand, I think.

59
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:52,583
A person who reaches that state is like a mirror

60
00:11:52,583 --> 00:12:01,291
and so many faces pass over that mirror, so many look into that mirror,

61
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:05,875
so many decorate in front of the mirror,

62
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:09,625
but mirror is the same as it is.

63
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:15,625
So the person who is a Sitha Pragya or the person who is Sahaja

64
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:22,458
is not bothered about what is facing him,

65
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,583
who is facing whom, where he is.

66
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:31,917
He stays within himself. He contains within himself.

67
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:39,875
Like the sun. If the sun plays with his different rays,

68
00:12:39,917 --> 00:12:46,542
he is not lost. All the rays again return to him.

69
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:54,083
In the same way, all the senses that we have,

70
00:12:54,125 --> 00:13:04,542
all the senses that are there do play around, but for a person who is in a Sahaja state

71
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:09,959
it doesn’t matter, it makes no difference. He’s not involved. He just plays around.

72
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:16,999
Again, all of them come back to him. This is a state you all have to achieve.

73
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,250
Then you are really Sahaja Yogis. But I still find people

74
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,542
lost, getting money out of Sahaja Yoga,

75
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:35,000
some people lost getting out of leaderships, some are lost in getting jealousies and envies and all that. So that means

76
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:38,250
a lot of work has to be done, still, within.

77
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:41,583
There is no need to work as such

78
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,458
if you leave everything.

79
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,291
That’s why I always say meditate, because when you meditate,

80
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:54,959
what happens, that all these things that are pulling you down are finished.

81
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:00,667
Gradually they disappear because you become yourself.

82
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:05,583
You get contained by yourself and you are never bored.

83
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,999
I am never bored. I don’t know what boring word means, you see.

84
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:12,750
When it is with you or alone, I never get bored.

85
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:18,542
What is there to get bored? If you are not involved into anything you never get bored.

86
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:23,959
Another thing is you rise above all these things, like greed.

87
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:28,875
Now people who are greedy are still involved making money

88
00:14:28,917 --> 00:14:33,999
here, making money there, all that thing. Those people who are still full of lust

89
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,417
are still making, organizing, some things like that.

90
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:42,875
But in a Sahaj Stithi you just watch.

91
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:51,625
You are just a witness. You are not lost into anything that is pulling you down.

92
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:56,583
This state is not difficult to achieve for you, at all,

93
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,208
because you have crossed over your mind.

94
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,709
Now all these things come to you through your mind.

95
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:08,458
I’ve already said that mind is a myth, which you must accept.

96
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:14,625
Myth is that this mind gives you ideas. Some people think,

97
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:22,834
“Yes Mother, but - yes Mother, but - .” This “but” is coming from your brain, from your mind.

98
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:26,709
The brain is reality, but not the mind.

99
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:31,625
The mind says “but” and then you start feeling very depressed sometimes,

100
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:35,291
unhappy, because some people feel even bad

101
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:43,583
because they are very good people, that there are so few Sahaja Yogis. Doesn’t matter. Just watch

102
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:49,583
and this watching state, this witness state is the Sahaja Stithi.

103
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:54,542
In that you become so subtle, you become yourself,

104
00:15:54,583 --> 00:16:00,458
meaning so subtle that nothing can disturb you, nothing can change you.

105
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:07,083
Now see the nature as it is. You know there are ninety-two elements

106
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:11,375
and ninety-two elements, none of them can be,

107
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:19,583
say for example, you cannot make silver into gold. Gold into silver.

108
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:24,792
The atoms are so arranged that

109
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:28,208
they have certain valencies and apart from atom,

110
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:35,208
even molecules are so arranged that they have their own structure. You cannot change.

111
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:40,041
If you try to change then you will create bombs, atomic bomb, this bomb.

112
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,709
It’s absolutely destructive.

113
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:47,875
It’s only human beings who can change, who can transform.

114
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:53,583
Now look at the blessings that you are a human being and you can be transformed

115
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:59,667
and you can be made into a new element that is the Self.

116
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:02,834
This is the specialty of human beings.

117
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,875
But if somebody there is a false guru or somebody,

118
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:09,041
he tries to do something, you’ll explode.

119
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:13,792
I have seen people who have been to false gurus, they still faint,

120
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:22,125
they still have problems, they still get troubled more than people who have been without them.

121
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:26,542
They are also all right now, most of them are improved

122
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:35,208
but this is one thing one should understand, that in one way when you are analyzing

123
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:41,333
and when you are breaking an atom or you are breaking a molecule and trying to transform,

124
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:52,625
it explodes. It doesn’t work out. The other way round is that when you try to synthesize,

125
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:56,542
then you can form anything in the nature.

126
00:17:56,583 --> 00:18:04,458
Like, this has now been brought out by synthesizing, this plastic is created by synthesizing.

127
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,583
Matter can be synthesized and can be brought together

128
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:15,291
Human beings have to be synthesized also

129
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:23,625
They can be synthesized better than matter because they change,

130
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:30,834
they transform. Now say example, there is gold. You make gold into ornaments,

131
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:40,542
make into anything. It remains all the time, all the time gold. Gold is gold.

132
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:49,333
It is there. It is not that by changing them into ornaments it changes. Its element is there. Gold is there.

133
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:54,750
But for human beings they get transformed. When they are synthesized.

134
00:18:54,792 --> 00:18:59,709
This is a very big difference between the matter and the nature

135
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:07,083
and human beings. Matter, nature, are different absolutely

136
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:12,792
from human beings. Human beings, once they are transformed,

137
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:19,834
it’s like a living process. They become like flowers

138
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:28,750
but still it is not that you see in the nature. It’s not the same as you see in the nature

139
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:35,291
because nature doesn’t have a mind. It doesn’t have a mind. It just is

140
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:42,834
under the control of the Divine or nature that it’s working out that way.

141
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:46,959
But here you are under your own control.

142
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:52,291
Here you can control yourself.

143
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:56,792
In this synthesis which is growing inside you

144
00:19:56,792 --> 00:20:01,875
what you find, that you are completely in control of yourself.

145
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:05,458
You know what is happening to you.

146
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:11,750
Now you start seeing yourself separating from all these things.

147
00:20:11,792 --> 00:20:16,709
Some people come and tell Me, “Mother, see, my ego is very bad, you just take it out.”

148
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:24,834
He sees his ego, he sees what is the problem is. Somebody says, “Mother, my nabhi is very bad,

149
00:20:24,834 --> 00:20:28,250
I’m still busy with the money.” He sees it.

150
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:33,458
First starts the knowledge about yourself,

151
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:40,417
we call as self-knowledge. But one has to even go beyond self-knowledge.

152
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:53,250
By that knowledge, what do you do, we have to see? When you have the knowledge, first we say there’s no knowledge,

153
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:56,208
people have no knowledge, they are ignorant, there’s darkness,

154
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:02,750
all that. Now the light has come, you can see. You can know what’s wrong within you.

155
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:09,709
Now you start separating yourself from all those things that you see as wrong with you.

156
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,792
You see them getting out.

157
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:20,709
So many nonsensical things there are. Like, we have jealousies, envy, greed and lust.

158
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:24,583
I mean, it’s horrible things to say on a Diwali function, see.

159
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:31,375
So the Diwali is that one by one so many lights are enlightened

160
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:39,583
and you start seeing it first. First you start seeing what is wrong with you and then,

161
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:46,583
as you see it, you don’t want it. Then you work out to get rid of it,

162
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,000
to become clean.

163
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:53,625
Now this also knowledge disappears.

164
00:21:53,667 --> 00:22:01,166
You don’t have to have any knowledge. You are there. You are there.

165
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:06,333
There is no need to know about your chakras, you are just there.

166
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:14,959
At that stage nothing matters. You become just like a stone,

167
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:19,875
I can say. Stone with a brain intact and a heart intact

168
00:22:19,917 --> 00:22:26,458
and a liver intact. You just don’t mind anything, don’t get upset with anything.

169
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:35,999
You just enjoy the love and compassion that’s flowing.

170
00:22:35,999 --> 00:22:38,834
And the ripples that come back to you,

171
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:41,875
even that is lost after some time

172
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:44,750
and you are just nothing but Sahaj.

173
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:51,500
That is the state people achieved. In those days they achieved this state.

174
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:58,750
But with that, what lacking happened, that they’d get lost. They all got lost. They couldn’t do anything to others.

175
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:04,458
One person getting it, becoming great, finished. Or two persons at the most.

176
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:11,208
So now Sahaja Yoga stands first of all at the knowledge state,

177
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:16,583
where you have the knowledge. First, you should first of all have full knowledge

178
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:20,333
about yourself. The self-knowledge should be complete.

179
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:25,667
Then in the third stage we should say that when the knowledge is full

180
00:23:25,709 --> 00:23:31,250
you should get rid of all those things that you know about yourself,

181
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,083
which are useless, which are hampering your progress,

182
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:36,250
which you know is wrong.

183
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:40,667
Like, I see some dirt falling on my sari, I’ll just clean it out like that.

184
00:23:40,667 --> 00:23:46,417
Then you start separating yourself into that Sahaja state.

185
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:53,417
But still in Sahaja Yoga you develop another dimension

186
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:59,875
which is collective consciousness. That is the modern Sahaja Yoga.

187
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:05,625
In the olden days they didn’t have this, so they just all got lost.

188
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:13,959
Now you have collective consciousness and in that collective consciousness you start feeling others,

189
00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:21,333
feeling for others, compassion for others and you start working out for others.

190
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:27,542
In that also, sometimes, you know, when you are working around, you think how much money I can make,

191
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:32,709
what I can achieve as a leader or some sort of thing is still there.

192
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:37,458
But this collective consciousness starts growing.

193
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:45,458
When it starts growing then you become as I said, drop in the ocean, means complete ocean.

194
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:54,041
You become complete ocean. So the ocean has its own mariadas.

195
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:58,999
It doesn’t bother. It has to live with its mariadas, it lives with its mariadas.

196
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:05,417
It doesn’t want to cross any boundaries, all right. Accept it. It will not cross its boundaries.

197
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:11,083
In the same way it happens that you are very self-contained.

198
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:19,166
You are not selfish, but you become very self-contained. You are contained within yourself.

199
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:22,750
I know many Sahaja Yogis are angry

200
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,500
that I have not punished many horrible people

201
00:25:25,542 --> 00:25:27,208
who have been troubling Sahaja Yoga.

202
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:30,709
I don’t have to bother. There’s Paramchaitanya

203
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:34,333
which is doing a lot of work. Let it look after it.

204
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:39,417
Why should I bother about anyone? You see, after all, things are working out

205
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:49,792
so why to interfere? My job is just to watch, just to see.

206
00:25:49,834 --> 00:25:56,625
That’s sufficient. There’s no need for Me to kill anybody

207
00:25:56,667 --> 00:26:01,041
in this lifetime or to destroy. They are destroyed by themselves.

208
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:05,583
I have told you that I need not expose people,

209
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:09,834
but whichever country I go, I find people get exposed.

210
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:12,458
I run away from there, really, sometimes, thinking,

211
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,750
God knows what more is going to come.

212
00:26:14,792 --> 00:26:18,041
Even little attention on any country,

213
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:23,792
it just works out. Even without My knowledge,

214
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:26,041
“Oh My God,” I said, “When did I do that?”

215
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:36,083
So one has to become, of course, he becomes the power of Divine love, no doubt.

216
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:43,999
He becomes the power of Divine love, but he doesn’t handle it. Left to this Divine power

217
00:26:43,999 --> 00:26:47,709
which is working, which is also separated from Me,

218
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:52,375
you’ll be surprised. I am alone. Absolutely alone.

219
00:26:52,417 --> 00:26:58,083
Even this power is separated from Me, but this power knows

220
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:02,709
what is good for human beings, what is good for Sahaja Yoga.

221
00:27:02,709 --> 00:27:07,458
It works on it’s own. I don’t interfere. It’s a reflex action,

222
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:11,000
believe Me, it’s a reflex action. Maybe you might say,

223
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:17,041
“Mother, you have made it.” All right, whatever it is, but I don’t interfere with it.

224
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:23,083
I don’t have to tell anything to it. It just works and it’s working so well.

225
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:27,500
I’ll give you an example. Once in England long time back, they said,

226
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,583
“Mother, we want to have a very long summer.” I said,

227
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:31,999
“Why do you want to ask such things?” “No, no, Mother,

228
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,250
we must have a long summer, a very long summer, very - “

229
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:41,208
Three or four times they said it and it was a very long, horrible summer in London.

230
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:46,959
And it’s not like India where we have air conditioning, fans,

231
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:51,250
something we have, at least hand fans. There was nothing there.

232
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:55,208
So we didn’t know. We had a little gallery, we used to sleep in that.

233
00:27:55,250 --> 00:28:04,208
So we went to the shop in England and we asked in London City, for a fan. So they said,

234
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:08,667
“All right, after three months. You order us.” After three months

235
00:28:08,709 --> 00:28:13,458
when it will be very cold they will give us the fan. We said, “We don’t want any fans.”

236
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:17,500
So My daughter sent two fans by plane.

237
00:28:17,542 --> 00:28:20,792
And that’s how we managed. You see, Indians, we feel very hot

238
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:23,750
because we have had a lot of sun in our country,

239
00:28:23,792 --> 00:28:25,875
we feel much hotter than any one of you.

240
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:30,750
The way you sit in the sun, you know, we can’t understand. You know, in India they used to say

241
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:34,709
an Englishman and a mad dog can only go in the sun.

242
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:41,041
So our situation is like that, that we cannot go in the sun

243
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:43,000
because we have had too much.

244
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:49,792
And this summer, you see, was so tremendous, so tremendous that after that one thing good happened.

245
00:28:49,834 --> 00:28:56,333
That ochre color appeared on the leaves and then gradually the red

246
00:28:56,375 --> 00:29:00,750
and all that of the autumn season was best at that time

247
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:05,375
and then one Sahaja Yogi dreamt that, “Mother asked me

248
00:29:05,417 --> 00:29:07,875
to drive in Her back yard.”

249
00:29:07,917 --> 00:29:13,750
So he told everybody that, “Mother has been asking me to drive in the back yard.”

250
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:17,667
So I telephoned to him, I didn’t know he had dreamt like that, that,

251
00:29:17,709 --> 00:29:23,709
“Can you come along for a while, I want to go and see this autumn all over England.”

252
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:27,417
So he came and we were driving, miles together

253
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:32,583
and then they told Me, “Mother, it was so, he told us that that was My back yard.”

254
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:35,750
Can you imagine that he was driving for miles together,

255
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,917
beautiful, just like Canada,

256
00:29:37,917 --> 00:29:42,333
the whole England was filled with the beauty of autumn.

257
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:48,000
So even if there’s something like that happens, it is compensated.

258
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:54,166
It is compensated and so beautiful it was, all the people were out in the autumn

259
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:57,041
to see the beautiful colors of the nature,

260
00:29:57,083 --> 00:30:03,417
of different greenery, yellow, ochre, all kinds of colors were there.

261
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:07,041
Surprisingly, in that country you never see all that.

262
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:12,750
And because of the sun shining so bright, it was compensated.

263
00:30:12,792 --> 00:30:18,333
It was compensated by this Paramchaitanya. So the Paramchaitanya

264
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:29,208
is looking after this. All these things are managed by Paramchaitanya. I am doing nothing. I am Nishkriya.

265
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,625
I’m just sitting down and watching.

266
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:36,291
To Me nothing matters. You see, it’s working out slowly and steadily.

267
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:40,417
Ha, if you tell Me something supposing, they said, “Mother, we prayed to You

268
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:42,709
and it happened.” All right, maybe,

269
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:47,709
these people must have heard, around Me, Not me, you see,

270
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:54,417
and they must have done the job and for that I’m not responsible, in no way.

271
00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:58,041
Like one lady in Mexico had a son, was very sick

272
00:30:58,041 --> 00:31:02,333
and was about to die. She wrote a letter to Me, three letters

273
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:05,333
she wrote that, “My son is going to die, he’s a young fellow,

274
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:09,750
studying in Harvard.” I didn’t do anything.

275
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,999
I never wrote to her. Fourth letter came

276
00:31:11,999 --> 00:31:14,166
that he’s completely cured.

277
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:16,959
Now I didn’t do that because I was just sitting in one place

278
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:19,291
and how is it, it has worked out.

279
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:22,583
So everything, you see, you think I do

280
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:26,041
is not done by Me. Is done by this Paramchaitanya.

281
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:30,959
Because I’m also separated from you, completely, absolutely separated.

282
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:35,999
So they say, “You pray, now.” You can pray. If you pray, you pray to these deities

283
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,250
that are around, you pray to all these ganas and all that, not to Me.

284
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:45,333
Because I have nothing to do with it. You see, they don’t tell Me

285
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:48,417
that I have to do this or I have to do that, so why should I tell them

286
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:52,875
do this or do that? It is like that. And in that state only

287
00:31:52,917 --> 00:31:55,166
we can say you are in a Sahaja state,

288
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:58,375
where you don’t desire anything, you don’t want anything.

289
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:03,959
I do everything. All kinds of things, I am doing. Like the sun is doing,

290
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:11,875
I am also doing in the sense that I’m looking after things, flowers, this that.

291
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:20,500
I am also receiving presents from you, I’m receiving this from you and then see, I don’t receive anything.

292
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:25,000
I don’t have anything. I have no interest in it.

293
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,166
But you want to give for your joy, all right,

294
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:31,667
have it. You want to put flowers, all right, you can have flowers.

295
00:32:31,709 --> 00:32:37,291
Even if there’s flowers or not makes no difference to Me as a person, I’m saying.

296
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:43,333
But as Your Mother I love you. All of you I love.

297
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:46,834
But I don’t do anything as such to love you. And everybody says,

298
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:48,834
“Mother, You love us so much.” When?

299
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:51,458
When did I love you. I never even kissed you.

300
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,083
But you always say I love you very much. So

301
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:57,458
what is this. Who is working it out, this?

302
00:32:57,458 --> 00:33:02,875
Is something which is not Me, beyond Me. This is the state in which,

303
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:05,917
once we rise, we call it as Sahaja Stithi.

304
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:09,375
In the Sahaja Stithi you think you are doing nothing.

305
00:33:09,417 --> 00:33:11,333
Everything is working out.

306
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:14,041
But at this stage if I tell you, you say,

307
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:15,750
“Oh, we are not doing anything.

308
00:33:15,792 --> 00:33:19,333
Why should we spread Sahaja Yoga, it’s not our job?”

309
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:26,750
Just now, that’s not your stithi, that’s why. So you have to rise up

310
00:33:26,792 --> 00:33:28,834
to that state. That’s only possible

311
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:36,792
when you are in the knowledge state, where you have self-knowledge, the knowledge of the whole world.

312
00:33:36,834 --> 00:33:38,750
But if you go beyond knowledge

313
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,792
then you must have seen many a times, I just say something.

314
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:49,125
I just say something and it is there. I never feel vibrations of anyone

315
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:53,208
or anything. I don’t feel My Kundalini, either nor any chakras, nothing,

316
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:55,959
but I know, know automatically

317
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:59,000
like a computer. But that computer also I am not.

318
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,166
Just it’s trouble, it’s difficult to explain to you

319
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:07,166
what is this stithi is because you have to achieve it. Once you achieve it

320
00:34:07,208 --> 00:34:11,959
then you are in a very subtle state and that subtle state

321
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:17,875
is nothing but bliss. But that bliss also you cannot enjoy.

322
00:34:17,917 --> 00:34:22,917
I don’t know how to enjoy everything.

323
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:26,542
Supposing now you say, “Jai Mataji.”

324
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:29,166
I forget even you are calling Me.

325
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:32,583
I also say, “Jai Mataji,” finished.

326
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:38,166
See it is such a simple thing one has to understand

327
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:41,625
that the state in which one has to rise

328
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:48,083
is a state where without doing anything, everything works out. If that is your state, all right.

329
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:52,208
But it’s not so. So you have to rise up to that state

330
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:56,500
by doing. First you have to do it. First you have to know

331
00:34:56,542 --> 00:35:01,875
and then knowledge has no need, you don’t have to know,

332
00:35:01,917 --> 00:35:05,792
but first that has to be worked out and brought to that level.

333
00:35:05,792 --> 00:35:13,208
Now Diwali has the significance that on Diwali day, what we do, we put lights all over.

334
00:35:13,208 --> 00:35:18,375
So that we put Sahaja Yoga everywhere.

335
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:29,917
But does the light know about itself? Does the candle knows about itself?

336
00:35:29,959 --> 00:35:34,125
She enlightens everything but she doesn’t know.

337
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:44,166
Like the moon, which is giving moonlight, does it know itself?

338
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:55,333
Does he enjoy? Nothing. In the same way it happens that on a Diwali day

339
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:59,458
you are, what you are doing is enlightening people, you are enlightening them,

340
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:04,208
you are doing all this for them, it’s a good idea. You must do it.

341
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:08,375
But also know that you have to become the lamp yourself

342
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:11,333
which doesn’t know yourself.

343
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:16,208
So there are two messages. The first one is

344
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:19,999
that we have to enlighten the world, we have to enlighten others.

345
00:36:19,999 --> 00:36:21,959
This is the first one. Then

346
00:36:21,959 --> 00:36:29,208
we have to become that which is the light itself and light itself doesn’t know.

347
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:32,959
Yesterday you were singing, “You are the light,” you are this thing.

348
00:36:32,999 --> 00:36:39,041
All right, so what? I was just saying, ‘Yes, I am the light, I don’t know Myself.”

349
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:44,583
That’s the state where you don’t know you are the light.

350
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:47,750
You just don’t know that. It doesn’t come into your head.

351
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:51,750
Even so many times you have sung, you have said thousand names there are,

352
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:56,583
everything, but it doesn’t come into My head that this is Me you are talking about.

353
00:36:56,625 --> 00:37:02,500
Now when I say this I don’t know how you will react.

354
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,583
Because human beings are queer birds, you see.

355
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:10,625
You tell them something. Maybe that your ego might come up and you say,

356
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:13,000
“Yes, yes, I am also just the same.”

357
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,750
There are many, many who came like that, that,

358
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,375
“I am higher than Mataji.”

359
00:37:18,417 --> 00:37:22,125
Ba, ba maybe, I don’t know. There are many who said that,

360
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:29,834
“I am Kalki.” Nowadays there’s one fellow going round saying, “I am Kalki, I am this, I am that.”

361
00:37:29,834 --> 00:37:34,875
All right doesn’t matter. You be that, very good idea.

362
00:37:34,917 --> 00:37:50,709
But if I say I am Adi Shakti that means

363
00:37:50,709 --> 00:37:54,999
I don’t know what I am, really. I had to say

364
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,417
because people said, “Mother, you have to declare.”

365
00:37:57,458 --> 00:38:02,375
Declare what? Whatever I am, that I am. Now I find

366
00:38:02,417 --> 00:38:07,333
by declaration you people started growing more,

367
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:09,583
so all right, have it that way.

368
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:15,166
But there is no need for anyone to declare anything or to say anything.

369
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:18,542
That is the state one has to achieve.

370
00:38:18,542 --> 00:38:22,583
But to get to that state you have to work.

371
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:27,792
And work is to spread Sahaja Yoga. You have to enlighten many lights.

372
00:38:27,834 --> 00:38:32,333
That means you will realize that you are the light

373
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:34,625
which is enlightening all that,

374
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:40,208
and then in a subtle way you will realize that, “I am the light.”

375
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:43,333
Many Sahaja Yogis are doing a lot of work

376
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:46,458
and working it out, spreading Sahaja Yoga.

377
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:51,625
It’s a very great thing that has happened. In so many countries,

378
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:58,959
the way it has spread, it has removed the darkness of religion which was outside.

379
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:05,875
It was darkness of so many - racialism, thisism, thatism, all it has removed.

380
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:14,458
So this has worked out, the cleansing. For you to have the clean water to swim.

381
00:39:14,458 --> 00:39:21,000
Once you start doing that then you realize gradually

382
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:26,333
that now the sea is clean, we just watch,

383
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:32,667
we just see how it is working. I hope in your lifetime only, you achieve this state

384
00:39:32,709 --> 00:39:41,000
where you achieve your complete work of self-realization to others.

385
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,583
Those who do not give self-realization to others,

386
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:47,542
who just come for the pujas, this thing, are mediocres.

387
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:50,333
They cannot rise very high.

388
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:53,542
This coming to puja is what, like, you just rise higher with the puja

389
00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:57,583
then again you go down. But those who steadily grow

390
00:39:57,625 --> 00:40:01,166
will grow into this state, I am sure, in My lifetime

391
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:08,125
I should be able to see such people who are such that if they stand here they emit peace,

392
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:13,500
they emit light, they emit everything. Because they are the light. They don’t have to enlighten,

393
00:40:13,542 --> 00:40:18,417
but they are the light. Such a stage has to be developed

394
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,959
and to be worked out within yourself.

395
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:26,917
And this state has been described by so many poets, so many saints and everything,

396
00:40:26,917 --> 00:40:29,834
but they were at that stage and people thought,

397
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:32,375
what is this they are talking? They thought they were mad.

398
00:40:32,417 --> 00:40:36,583
Even for Christ, they thought He is to be crucified, because they couldn’t understand it.

399
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:40,999
Now you are gradually growing one by one, step by step,

400
00:40:40,999 --> 00:40:46,166
so now you understand this. You understand Christ, you understand all these people

401
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:50,333
and at this stage you have still to work.

402
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:54,542
Those who do not work for Sahaja Yoga cannot rise higher.

403
00:40:54,583 --> 00:41:01,000
You have to work for Sahaja Yoga, you have to spread it more, you have to work it out,

404
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,542
enjoy each other, this brotherhood, everything.

405
00:41:04,583 --> 00:41:11,500
All the qualities of a beautiful personality should be there.

406
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:19,583
Unless and until you achieve that state, then you can only rise higher

407
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:22,667
to that stage which I am describing is a Sahaja Stithi.

408
00:41:22,709 --> 00:41:25,250
In that state you will be perfect.

409
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,834
But you must get rid of all these things

410
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:34,166
and today is a day, also of Maha Lakshmi. The first thing is, I think,

411
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:38,542
this madness about money. This should be understood

412
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:43,000
that it’s real madness. Those who are rich have no money.

413
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:44,917
You ask a rich man, he’ll say,

414
00:41:44,917 --> 00:41:48,792
“Oh, I have no money.” Why? What is all this? This is no money.

415
00:41:48,834 --> 00:41:51,333
You ask the poor man, he has no money.

416
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:53,083
A rich man has no money.

417
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:59,333
So it’s a kind of a greed which is never satisfied,

418
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:05,208
which never helps you. All these little, little things have to first drop out.

419
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:08,375
Then your work should cleanse you. In your work

420
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:10,999
you will know whether you are cleansing or not.

421
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,709
In the work you will know how you are doing your work.

422
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:17,583
Once that is done, then I think

423
00:42:17,625 --> 00:42:20,583
I am sure some of you will achieve that state

424
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:27,083
in My lifetime, in your lifetime. That’s what I want today to tell you, on a Diwali day,

425
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:31,583
that we have to become subtler and subtler and subtler.

426
00:42:31,625 --> 00:42:35,041
We should not be influenced by outside things.

427
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:41,959
Like, the outside thing is that, some sort of a fashion starts.

428
00:42:41,999 --> 00:42:49,999
People who follow fashions are stupid. They are like blind mices.

429
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,999
Anybody can lead them into anything,

430
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,375
now do this, they do it. That, they do it.

431
00:42:54,417 --> 00:43:02,000
So if you try to follow any kind of a thought which is given to us by somebody else,

432
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,291
in that thought you’ll completely lose yourself

433
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:09,999
and you’ll become, “I am this, I am Christian, I am Hindu, I am Muslim.”

434
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:25,875
And when you become the Spirit then you start knowing so much

435
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:28,875
and this knowledge is very important.

436
00:43:28,917 --> 00:43:34,333
This is the gap between a saint and a normal human being,

437
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:36,999
which you have crossed gradually

438
00:43:36,999 --> 00:43:40,166
so you know what are the problems of the human beings are

439
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:44,291
and dealing with human beings, you know how to deal with them.

440
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:48,250
In Sahaja Yoga only the collective consciousness,

441
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:50,458
in modern times, has come.

442
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,125
This collective consciousness, also the saints had,

443
00:43:54,125 --> 00:44:01,125
but they would not say. They would not say anything. They would not bother.

444
00:44:01,166 --> 00:44:03,417
All right, this fellow has this chakra,

445
00:44:03,458 --> 00:44:06,041
let him go to hell. Doesn’t care.

446
00:44:06,083 --> 00:44:09,291
It’s not a question of not caring, but not bothered.

447
00:44:09,333 --> 00:44:11,375
They were sitting in a state which

448
00:44:11,417 --> 00:44:14,667
was just recording, all right.

449
00:44:14,709 --> 00:44:21,667
An ugly man goes before the mirror, all right, if a beautiful person goes before the mirror is all right.

450
00:44:21,709 --> 00:44:28,834
In the same way these people start allowing people to pass through

451
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:32,041
but we have to understand, still we have to grow.

452
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:37,917
We have to still grow by working it out. Those people who are working it out

453
00:44:37,917 --> 00:44:47,709
and spreading it all over are the ones which are really very much there

454
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:56,834
and to them, I must say, the Paramchaitanya is just their servant.

455
00:44:56,875 --> 00:45:02,250
I have seen people who desire something, it works out.

456
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:07,917
They ask for something, it works out. For that, now,

457
00:45:07,917 --> 00:45:09,959
what should we have, is the point.

458
00:45:09,959 --> 00:45:14,417
After getting realization, after getting everything,

459
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:20,375
what should we have that we develop is the faith. Faith in yourself.

460
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:29,999
Faith in that you are the Spirit, that you have the light

461
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,667
and you have to enlighten others.

462
00:45:32,709 --> 00:45:41,125
This faith when it grows deeper and deeper then you think,

463
00:45:41,166 --> 00:45:46,083
oh, what I am. I am the Spirit.

464
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:50,792
If you are the Spirit then this whole nature is with you.

465
00:45:50,834 --> 00:45:58,208
I know of some Sahaja Yogis. One of them was a fisherman.

466
00:45:58,208 --> 00:46:02,834
He was doing Sahaja Yoga work. He has tremendous faith in Me

467
00:46:02,834 --> 00:46:09,542
and somehow he was going to another village to do Sahaja Yoga work.

468
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:16,917
When he came out of his little hut he found it’s all full of clouds, black clouds.

469
00:46:16,917 --> 00:46:21,291
So he raised his hand and said, “See now, I’m going for Mother’s work.

470
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:23,917
And you dare not start raining.

471
00:46:23,917 --> 00:46:28,875
You keep as you are, hanging there till I finish my work,” you see.

472
00:46:28,917 --> 00:46:31,291
Because he was going by boat.

473
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:34,417
And other Sahaja Yogis thought, “What is he talking about?”

474
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:38,083
They all got into the boat, they reached the other village.

475
00:46:38,083 --> 00:46:42,083
They gave realization to others, he finished his lecturing, everything,

476
00:46:42,125 --> 00:46:45,250
he came back on the shore and he entered his house.

477
00:46:45,291 --> 00:46:46,083
When he was closing the door,

478
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:50,750
“All right, so go ahead,” he said. And he managed.

479
00:46:50,792 --> 00:46:56,041
So the complete faith that this Paramchaitanya is like your servant,

480
00:46:56,083 --> 00:46:59,667
is all the time waiting there to serve you.

481
00:46:59,667 --> 00:47:02,083
Whatever you say will happen.

482
00:47:02,083 --> 00:47:06,083
But first you must have complete faith in yourself

483
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:07,999
that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

484
00:47:07,999 --> 00:47:12,000
Even now I find, you see, people have some lust,

485
00:47:12,041 --> 00:47:15,709
some sort of a horrible things in them.

486
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:19,291
So first you must be established in Dharma.

487
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:24,834
Dharma, is, as you know, is righteousness. If you are in the righteousness,

488
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:29,792
there’s no question. There’s no question that this Paramchaitanya won’t obey you.

489
00:47:29,834 --> 00:47:34,834
But supposing you want today something and it doesn’t work out,

490
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:39,125
then even to get disappointed itself is not a very good thing.

491
00:47:39,125 --> 00:47:48,583
Disappointment also is a sign of your immaturity.

492
00:47:48,625 --> 00:47:50,667
What is there to be disappointed?

493
00:47:50,709 --> 00:47:57,208
Maybe that that was good for you.

494
00:47:57,208 --> 00:48:02,959
Supposing I lose My way. I’m going this way and I lose My way,

495
00:48:02,999 --> 00:48:07,041
I don’t know where to go. So I get lost, it’s all right. What is there? Wherever I am,

496
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:10,667
I am there. How can I be lost to Myself.

497
00:48:10,667 --> 00:48:14,208
And then what I find, that I had to go that way

498
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:18,542
because I was to meet somebody, I’ve been wanting to meet somebody

499
00:48:18,542 --> 00:48:24,792
and meet that person there. Can you imagine? Such things happen with Me,

500
00:48:24,834 --> 00:48:26,917
and even if I don’t meet, so what?

501
00:48:26,917 --> 00:48:30,917
I was to go that side. I have to leave some vibrations, perhaps.

502
00:48:30,959 --> 00:48:35,834
It’s like that. So once you know that whatever you are doing

503
00:48:35,834 --> 00:48:40,959
in command, full command, full faith,

504
00:48:40,999 --> 00:48:45,417
actually the whole authority comes to you

505
00:48:45,458 --> 00:48:49,375
through your faith which word is satta in Sanskrit,

506
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:51,291
meaning the truth. The truth gives you the authority.

507
00:48:51,333 --> 00:49:00,083
Now another thing which is important is the faith in your guru.

508
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:07,375
If you have faith in your guru, Paramchaitanya is kind

509
00:49:07,417 --> 00:49:10,875
to you. It’s very helpful. But if you doubt,

510
00:49:10,875 --> 00:49:14,291
then Paramchaitanya also doubts you

511
00:49:14,333 --> 00:49:18,291
because Paramchaitanya knows you through your guru,

512
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:21,750
whether it is Me or any other real guru, it’s the same.

513
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:25,999
But with Me, of course, because, you know,

514
00:49:25,999 --> 00:49:27,458
I’m very forgiving so people

515
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,999
start taking liberties.

516
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,792
With another guru, you see, he will beat them.

517
00:49:32,834 --> 00:49:38,041
He’ll do all kinds of horrible things to you if you are not there.

518
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:40,750
So I’ve told you many stories about the gurus,

519
00:49:40,792 --> 00:49:43,625
how they treat - good gurus - their disciples.

520
00:49:43,667 --> 00:49:47,291
But I forgive. I don’t say anything. Let it be, it doesn’t matter.

521
00:49:47,333 --> 00:49:50,583
Because I think by leaving them alone only,

522
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:53,291
they will rise and they will come up to this stage.

523
00:49:53,291 --> 00:49:58,083
But it happens sometimes that it may work the other way round,

524
00:49:58,125 --> 00:50:05,041
that if they are forgiven, then they take it for granted.

525
00:50:05,041 --> 00:50:08,959
All rigth , there is freedom, you can take it for granted

526
00:50:18,417 --> 00:50:19,792
So the faith in yourself is with patience you watch

527
00:50:19,834 --> 00:50:24,125
and do not get disappointed with anything whatsoever.

528
00:50:24,166 --> 00:50:29,625
Now, just imagine so many people have got realization, so many saints in this world,

529
00:50:29,667 --> 00:50:35,458
have you seen? Yesterday I was surprised the way the French were singing so well.

530
00:50:35,458 --> 00:50:40,375
You know, first time I had to take a harmonium to teach them how to sing one line

531
00:50:40,375 --> 00:50:44,792
Half an hour I tried, I couldn’t do.

532
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:48,959
The same French have reached

533
00:50:50,417 --> 00:50:52,333
that state of creativity. You see,

534
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:56,208
all your potential will rise. It will express itself,

535
00:50:56,250 --> 00:51:00,500
but be careful not to get into ego about it.

536
00:51:00,542 --> 00:51:07,583
Gradually it will flower and others who are surrounding you will get the fragrance of it

537
00:51:07,583 --> 00:51:13,999
and they’ll come to Sahaja Yoga. That is the blessing at that time, the blessing of the real Divine

538
00:51:13,999 --> 00:51:18,458
will be that you’ll be raised to the state which we call as a perfect,

539
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:25,291
‘purnattwa’, complete. That completeness will come. But you judge yourself.

540
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:34,375
Are you absolutely one with Sahaj? Are you absolutely dedicated to Sahaj?

541
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:37,959
Or other things are more important to you than Sahaja Yoga?

542
00:51:37,999 --> 00:51:43,291
Then, go ahead.

543
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:49,667
There is something to be understood very clearly that there’s no competition

544
00:51:49,709 --> 00:51:53,291
in Sahaja Yoga. Cannot be. There’s no competition.

545
00:51:53,333 --> 00:52:01,625
There’s no envy, there is no back biting, nothing. It is, you are different people. You are saints.

546
00:52:01,792 --> 00:52:07,083
Your style is different. You are absolutely above

547
00:52:07,083 --> 00:52:10,125
all these things. You cannot be dishonest,

548
00:52:10,166 --> 00:52:14,750
you cannot cheat people, you cannot do this. And if you are doing that,

549
00:52:14,792 --> 00:52:21,500
even now, then please try to understand that you have still to grow into it.

550
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,834
Some big people think

551
00:52:23,834 --> 00:52:30,542
they are very high up in Sahaja Yoga. It’s not so, it’s not so.

552
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:36,750
If by thinking what you are, then you are lost.

553
00:52:36,792 --> 00:52:42,542
What you have to do is to understand “What have I done?

554
00:52:42,542 --> 00:52:45,583
How many people have I given realization,

555
00:52:45,583 --> 00:52:48,208
to how many people have talked about it?”

556
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:51,500
People are shy, even, to talk about Sahaja Yoga.

557
00:52:51,542 --> 00:52:54,375
I have seen one lady was traveling with Me. Very hot.

558
00:52:54,375 --> 00:53:01,959
I said, “Ba, ba who is she, this one? I don’t know.” So she told Me the name of her guru. She said, “My guru is like this, guru like that, like that.”

559
00:53:01,999 --> 00:53:06,750
I said, “My God, this heat coming out of this woman and she’s talking so much.”

560
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:11,208
But a Sahaja Yogi will not tell anybody what is Sahaja Yoga.

561
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:16,542
They feel shy. They’ll have a hundred friends, they’ll meet a hundred friends but they will never

562
00:53:16,583 --> 00:53:20,041
tell them what Sahaja Yoga is. They’ll be shy to tell them.

563
00:53:20,041 --> 00:53:24,333
Ah, they wouldn’t mind going to parties, you see, if the others are drinking they’ll say,

564
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:27,250
“All right, I don’t drink.” But they’ll not say, “I’m a Sahaja Yogi,

565
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:31,542
I cannot drink, by nature I cannot drink.” They will not say that.

566
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:38,291
So this is the third point, one has to know the announcement.

567
00:53:38,291 --> 00:53:42,500
You must have faith in yourself and you must announce.

568
00:53:42,542 --> 00:53:45,041
All the saints announced.

569
00:53:45,041 --> 00:53:49,792
They were killed for that, you saw how Socrates was given poison.

570
00:53:49,792 --> 00:53:53,417
Doesn’t matter. Nobody’s going to kill you now, in these modern times,

571
00:53:53,458 --> 00:53:58,208
there’s fundamental rights to exist. So nobody can kill you, take it from Me,

572
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:03,125
but you must announce. And the announcement should be with full faith

573
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:07,500
and understanding about Sahaja Yoga, how important it is.

574
00:54:07,542 --> 00:54:13,417
The purpose is to transform the whole world.

575
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:17,709
With your transformation the whole world transforms.

576
00:54:17,709 --> 00:54:22,875
It’s a very complicated thing, otherwise, Sahaja Yoga

577
00:54:22,917 --> 00:54:26,041
is extremely complicated because how it works.

578
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:31,625
The other day, you remember, the mike had failed completely

579
00:54:31,667 --> 00:54:36,041
and I was giving the lecture and still I was talking.

580
00:54:36,083 --> 00:54:40,542
The mike had failed but everybody was listening to Me.

581
00:54:40,542 --> 00:54:45,959
What had happened? Did I enter into the ether? What happened? I don’t know.

582
00:54:45,999 --> 00:54:50,583
I didn’t even know that mike had failed. I was thinking there is mike,

583
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:54,999
that the way people were listening to Me,

584
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,041
but then they told that half lecture was without the mike.

585
00:54:58,083 --> 00:55:02,583
And everybody was absolutely listening to Me.

586
00:55:02,625 --> 00:55:15,000
You see, it is something that one has to wonder and appreciate

587
00:55:15,041 --> 00:55:18,291
what things are happening now, where are we going.

588
00:55:20,291 --> 00:55:21,500
We are going into the Kingdom of God

589
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:26,500
and all the blessings, all the bliss will be on you.

590
00:55:26,542 --> 00:55:34,166
Then this bliss, knowledge, everything becomes one, nothing but bliss

591
00:55:34,208 --> 00:55:39,709
and you are in that state of bliss which you don’t even know,

592
00:55:39,709 --> 00:55:44,959
you are just there. The greatest bliss is that you don’t know even anything,

593
00:55:44,959 --> 00:55:47,583
you’re just there.

594
00:55:47,625 --> 00:55:50,458
I hope all of you achieve that state

595
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,291
with this Diwali being done in Portugal,

596
00:55:53,291 --> 00:55:58,333
which is a special place, I think, of Maha Lakshmi because She appeared here

597
00:55:58,333 --> 00:56:01,583
as they say and also this swayambu that we have,

598
00:56:01,583 --> 00:56:05,375
also is that of Maha Lakshmi face, so I’m sure

599
00:56:05,417 --> 00:56:07,500
it will work out for all of you.

600
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:10,542
It’s a little subtle state I’m talking about

601
00:56:10,583 --> 00:56:17,375
but it is, I have to tell you, that one has to rise up to that state

602
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:22,583
and that state is very, very easy to achieve for you.

603
00:56:22,583 --> 00:56:26,667
It slowly, gradually it - then you don’t have to do anything,

604
00:56:26,667 --> 00:56:29,208
you go into a village and everything would be there.

605
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:31,375
See, now, what happened. I went to Cairo.

606
00:56:31,375 --> 00:56:34,583
Everybody was saluting Me. I was wondering,

607
00:56:34,583 --> 00:56:37,500
what has happened to them? I went to Leningrad,

608
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,625
thousands came to My program. I asked them,

609
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:41,542
“How did you come to My program?” They said,

610
00:56:41,583 --> 00:56:48,166
“It’s obvious from Your face, it’s obvious.” They just saw a small, little advertisement in the newspaper,

611
00:56:48,208 --> 00:56:50,542
“It’s obvious that You are Divine.”

612
00:56:50,583 --> 00:56:54,959
That should happen. And then you can announce

613
00:56:54,999 --> 00:56:58,500
that Sahaja Yoga is the only way, then you can announce.

614
00:56:58,542 --> 00:57:03,959
There’s no harm. People feel very shy to say something to their friends and things.

615
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:08,333
And you must know that all of those who you love, who you know,

616
00:57:08,375 --> 00:57:11,999
will go to hell or where - they’ll hang in the limbo or what?

617
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,083
If you have achieved it you should pull them out also.

618
00:57:15,125 --> 00:57:19,041
They may not. They may not be seekers, doesn’t matter now.

619
00:57:19,083 --> 00:57:21,625
I think we are finished with the seekers now,

620
00:57:21,667 --> 00:57:23,417
must be - we must have people

621
00:57:23,458 --> 00:57:26,917
who are not so seeking, it looks like that.

622
00:57:26,959 --> 00:57:30,375
So may God bless you all
