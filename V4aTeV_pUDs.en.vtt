00:01:49.741 --> 00:01:53.607
Now we have to realize

00:01:53.988 --> 00:01:58.456
that Sahaja Yoga has spread a lot

00:01:59.415 --> 00:02:04.589
and in all corners of the world people respect Sahaja Yoga,

00:02:05.652 --> 00:02:08.715
but until and unless Sahaja Yoga

00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:14.038
is completely manifested within us,

00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:18.749
the people who respect Sahaja Yoga will not continue to do so.

00:02:19.924 --> 00:02:27.171
That is why it is essential that we look inside of us.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:34.272
The nature of Shri Krishna is that we look inside of us

00:02:34.426 --> 00:02:38.484
and see what are the things that put us in trouble.

00:02:41.045 --> 00:02:44.497
We should find that out.

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:50.874
We should look towards ourselves,

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.737
within ourselves

00:02:55.827 --> 00:02:59.510
and that is not such a difficult thing.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.828
When we want to see our face,

00:03:04.556 --> 00:03:08.479
we look in the mirror.

00:03:09.548 --> 00:03:16.118
Similarly, when we need to see our spirit,

00:03:16.426 --> 00:03:24.097
we should find out how to see it within us.

00:03:24.142 --> 00:03:26.649
Many Sahaja Yogis have asked Me,

00:03:26.864 --> 00:03:31.374
“Mother, how do we see what is within us

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.530
and how we are doing?.”

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:40.909
For that it is necessary that

00:03:42.203 --> 00:03:46.509
we ourselves should become very humble.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.909
If we lack humility,

00:03:51.086 --> 00:03:55.064
we will be clouded by our own thoughts.

00:03:55.975 --> 00:03:57.982
So in the life of Shri Krishna,

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.120
first it was shown that

00:04:01.176 --> 00:04:04.718
he was just like a small child.

00:04:05.432 --> 00:04:08.674
Absolutely like an infant.

00:04:08.754 --> 00:04:10.217
Not knowing anything.

00:04:10.312 --> 00:04:13.275
He did not think anything of himself.

00:04:13.402 --> 00:04:16.778
He had his mother

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:23.132
and he wanted to grow with the support of his mother.

00:04:24.225 --> 00:04:27.598
We should also look inside of ourselves

00:04:27.646 --> 00:04:31.482
and realize that we are like a small child as well.

00:04:35.133 --> 00:04:37.942
Shri Krishna has said this repeatedly.

00:04:38.162 --> 00:04:41.812
Also, Jesus Christ has said the same thing

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:45.212
that we should become like small children.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:55.675
We should see the comforting shade of
the sweet nature of a child.

00:04:56.465 --> 00:04:59.713
Do we talk like a child?

00:04:59.872 --> 00:05:08.670
What is the quality within us that we become like a child?

00:05:08.986 --> 00:05:14.663
Now child means purity, innocence.

00:05:15.001 --> 00:05:20.960
With this innocence we have to look towards ourselves

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:24.087
and cover ourselves with it.

00:05:24.437 --> 00:05:29.410
This innocence is very lovable.

00:05:30.614 --> 00:05:34.477
If you look at children and the love you feel towards them

00:05:34.695 --> 00:05:37.790
because they are innocent.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.724
They don’t know cleverness;

00:05:41.836 --> 00:05:46.235
don’t feel their importance, nothing at all.

00:05:47.018 --> 00:05:49.335
What do they know?

00:05:49.593 --> 00:05:55.540
They know that all these people are related to us.

00:05:55.755 --> 00:06:00.384
They are our brothers, sisters and everything.

00:06:02.876 --> 00:06:07.037
But how do they know this.

00:06:07.244 --> 00:06:12.499
That is the question. In the same way that these children know,

00:06:12.904 --> 00:06:16.158
we have forgotten that we are like an innocent child

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:18.803
and that we have innocence within us.

00:06:18.854 --> 00:06:21.657
There are many Sahaja Yogis  who come

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:28.579
and think that they will show their cleverness

00:06:29.553 --> 00:06:33.043
and prove themselves to Mother.

00:06:33.903 --> 00:06:39.559
What is the need to prove anything to Me?

00:06:40.374 --> 00:06:43.239
I already know everything.

00:06:43.733 --> 00:06:46.674
So what you should do is look

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:51.198
towards yourself and recognize your innocence.

00:06:51.421 --> 00:06:55.688
Where is it and how is it doing?

00:06:56.673 --> 00:06:59.487
And we should think

00:06:59.797 --> 00:07:03.816
how joyful it is.

00:07:04.072 --> 00:07:07.101
Now the thing about Shri Krishna is this only.

00:07:07.214 --> 00:07:10.972
He was absolutely simple as a child

00:07:11.131 --> 00:07:15.235
and when He grew up He explained The Gita,

00:07:15.402 --> 00:07:19.253
which is very deep.

00:07:20.032 --> 00:07:25.338
How did it happen that the human beings grew in it?

00:07:25.818 --> 00:07:30.242
In the same way we can grow in Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:30.361 --> 00:07:35.268
We have found it but still have not progressed in it.

00:07:35.404 --> 00:07:44.122
And to progress we need to leave the bad things behind.

00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:48.031
First of all we need to have a childlike temperament.

00:07:48.183 --> 00:07:52.606
Now if we say to somebody that you should become childlike,

00:07:52.741 --> 00:07:54.585
it is a very difficult thing to do.

00:07:54.911 --> 00:08:00.696
We cannot just leave whatever we are and become childlike.

00:08:00.856 --> 00:08:03.866
But living with children, having respect for them,

00:08:04.033 --> 00:08:08.051
listening to how they talk, can make a big difference

00:08:08.242 --> 00:08:11.969
and we change all the things within us.

00:08:12.239 --> 00:08:16.132
So first of all we have to know that within us,

00:08:16.347 --> 00:08:22.447
as we grew up, a lot of bad things have gone in.

00:08:23.835 --> 00:08:29.023
How should we remove those bad things?

00:08:29.356 --> 00:08:36.426
What are the kinds of bad things that have gotten into us?

00:08:37.197 --> 00:08:44.037
If we think about it and put attention on it, then we can correct it.

00:08:44.782 --> 00:08:47.578
We have to put attention on things like,

00:08:47.705 --> 00:08:52.118
when we talk to somebody aggressively,

00:08:52.335 --> 00:08:57.306
or we want to scold someone

00:08:57.473 --> 00:09:02.608
or  we keep thinking about
how to correct somebody else.

00:09:02.939 --> 00:09:06.320
When our attention goes on other people

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.188
then we get removed from our own self,

00:09:09.342 --> 00:09:12.175
because we have to ourselves be all right.

00:09:12.283 --> 00:09:16.481
That is why it is no use thinking about other people.

00:09:16.581 --> 00:09:19.263
So, first of all we should look at ourselves only,

00:09:19.401 --> 00:09:24.568
we should see ourselves.

00:09:24.915 --> 00:09:28.581
But all of that is happening,

00:09:28.694 --> 00:09:31.418
I have told about it and it is happening in Sahaja Yogis,

00:09:31.486 --> 00:09:38.655
because inside the kundalini awakens and shows all the paths.

00:09:38.985 --> 00:09:45.567
Now the remaining thing is the dirt that is within, how to fix that.

00:09:46.872 --> 00:09:55.465
First and foremost the way we look at
the defects of others should be changed

00:09:55.755 --> 00:09:58.739
because the same defects exist within us also.

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:01.242
So instead of looking at the defects of others,

00:10:01.329 --> 00:10:04.773
we should see what are the defects within us.

00:10:04.837 --> 00:10:12.320
If we can learn to see this, then a lot of things
would become all right automatically.

00:10:15.413 --> 00:10:25.212
The thing with saints and sages is
that they see their own defects

00:10:25.367 --> 00:10:32.936
and they think about how they became like that.

00:10:33.486 --> 00:10:39.465
They think, “Why do I say such harsh things?

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:42.785
Why do I lie like this?”

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:48.083
So this is a flow of watching oneself.

00:10:48.581 --> 00:10:52.621
Most of the time we do not flow with that.

00:10:52.708 --> 00:10:55.870
We think we are separate from that.

00:10:56.164 --> 00:11:02.480
But it is not like that. If we understand
that there is this flow within us

00:11:02.705 --> 00:11:04.406
that takes us to such paths

00:11:04.431 --> 00:11:06.928
where we cannot even recognize ourselves,

00:11:07.084 --> 00:11:10.545
then a human being can turn inwards.

00:11:10.697 --> 00:11:15.326
Now just to say that you go within yourself, meditate,

00:11:15.501 --> 00:11:19.396
take out these things from within, is very easy.

00:11:19.642 --> 00:11:21.745
But that will not do.

00:11:21.927 --> 00:11:26.410
That is why we have to meditate and constantly work towards it.

00:11:26.748 --> 00:11:30.835
And we have ways that we know.

00:11:31.603 --> 00:11:35.515
Like to meditate on Shri Krishna.

00:11:36.227 --> 00:11:41.679
By meditating on Shri Krishna we get cleansed from within.

00:11:41.965 --> 00:11:46.956
But when we meditate on Shri Krishna

00:11:47.059 --> 00:11:52.073
we think about the defects of others.

00:11:52.762 --> 00:11:58.642
If we want to look at the defects of Shri Krishna

00:11:58.964 --> 00:12:01.717
we can see that also,

00:12:02.131 --> 00:12:06.280
but we cannot see our own defects.

00:12:06.542 --> 00:12:09.097
This is too much that we cannot see our own defects

00:12:09.387 --> 00:12:12.506
but are able to see the defects of Shri Krishna.

00:12:12.549 --> 00:12:16.027
I have seen a lot of people who have written books about

00:12:16.075 --> 00:12:18.504
what were the defects in Shri Krishna.

00:12:18.551 --> 00:12:20.601
What wrong things did he do?

00:12:20.693 --> 00:12:22.954
How he should have lived?

00:12:23.029 --> 00:12:25.624
And they don’t know about themselves.

00:12:26.188 --> 00:12:30.048
But even when they think about themselves,

00:12:30.908 --> 00:12:36.107
and look at themselves, it is never in a way

00:12:36.205 --> 00:12:43.316
that this defect exists within and it should go away.

00:12:43.812 --> 00:12:47.560
They can keep on discussing about the defects of others.

00:12:47.849 --> 00:12:51.658
The only thing we have to see is what are the defects

00:12:51.812 --> 00:12:53.812
that we have within ourselves.

00:12:53.883 --> 00:12:59.841
I do not believe that there is
a greater yogi than Shri Krishna,

00:13:00.136 --> 00:13:05.651
because he showed us the way to look at the mistakes within ourselves,

00:13:06.137 --> 00:13:08.660
the defects within ourselves.

00:13:08.789 --> 00:13:10.958
This is a very big thing.

00:13:11.059 --> 00:13:14.860
He said it, but people who actually do it are very less in number.

00:13:15.343 --> 00:13:18.200
Mostly we look at the defects of others,

00:13:18.288 --> 00:13:20.057
because everyone remembers them,

00:13:20.183 --> 00:13:21.907
everyone knows them.

00:13:22.014 --> 00:13:26.335
But very few people are able to understand their own defects.

00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:29.592
That is why those people will never be all right.

00:13:29.806 --> 00:13:35.194
We have to be familiar with our own defects

00:13:35.294 --> 00:13:37.815
and laugh at ourselves

00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.109
and think that “look at me,

00:13:40.199 --> 00:13:45.368
what kind of defects I am having within myself”.

00:13:45.515 --> 00:13:48.948
We should think about this.

00:13:50.433 --> 00:13:56.072
This attention is never on the self

00:13:56.263 --> 00:13:59.107
but on the defects of others.

00:13:59.348 --> 00:14:02.405
This causes us to be unsettled

00:14:02.516 --> 00:14:07.592
and we fail to understand that these are our own defects.

00:14:07.826 --> 00:14:11.016
Why are we looking at the defects of others?

00:14:11.191 --> 00:14:13.578
By doing this, is it going to fix our defects?

00:14:13.697 --> 00:14:18.086
They can never be fixed like this.

00:14:18.396 --> 00:14:21.694
Slowly, as this point is understood,

00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:27.198
man will stop focusing on the defects of others.

00:14:27.396 --> 00:14:31.242
Looking at his own defects will amaze him

00:14:31.437 --> 00:14:36.980
and realizing how many devils he has harbored within himself.

00:14:37.215 --> 00:14:41.254
Within our mind we keep thinking such dirty things.

00:14:41.699 --> 00:14:44.711
When this cleansing starts,

00:14:44.942 --> 00:14:49.541
man, in a way, assumes a special form.

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:54.268
He gets special powers

00:14:54.558 --> 00:14:58.065
and with those powers he can do many things.

00:14:58.692 --> 00:15:02.721
This happens not to boost his ego,

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:06.338
but so that he gets cleansed.

00:15:06.808 --> 00:15:09.945
When we start getting cleansed like this,

00:15:10.065 --> 00:15:13.310
we have achieved our goal.

00:15:13.544 --> 00:15:17.761
Therefore, by looking at our own defects,

00:15:18.107 --> 00:15:23.640
we start cleansing ourselves
and leave the defects behind.

00:15:23.728 --> 00:15:27.574
Now how to do this?

00:15:27.813 --> 00:15:31.982
Because, seeing the defect is not a hard thing,

00:15:32.235 --> 00:15:35.888
but to let go of it, is the hard part.

00:15:36.023 --> 00:15:39.069
That is why the way to see the defect has to be subtle

00:15:39.168 --> 00:15:41.218
and minute, and our attention should be towards it.

00:15:41.243 --> 00:15:42.584
A lot can be cleansed like this.

00:15:42.953 --> 00:15:48.658
The message of today’s festival is that

00:15:49.468 --> 00:15:52.059
we should look within ourselves and see.

00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:55.436
This is what Shri Krishna has said.

00:15:55.689 --> 00:15:59.486
But people find this hard to do.

00:15:59.637 --> 00:16:01.356
It doesn’t happen.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:08.083
What is the reason that we are not able to see ourselves?

00:16:09.074 --> 00:16:11.760
What is this veil in between?

00:16:12.109 --> 00:16:14.180
The veil is of bad things like ego etc.

00:16:14.554 --> 00:16:24.436
They stand up and we are unable to see the defects

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:27.914
that we should see.

00:16:29.383 --> 00:16:35.892
To see these defects is very essential.

00:16:38.919 --> 00:16:42.711
I am very happy that you kept today’s puja.

00:16:42.925 --> 00:16:46.790
Shri Krishna’s puja will take place and

00:16:47.583 --> 00:16:50.865
a lot of people will get cleansed from within

00:16:51.464 --> 00:16:56.482
because this is a special blessing of Shri Krishna.

00:16:56.656 --> 00:16:58.468
He will do it Himself,

00:16:58.622 --> 00:17:01.421
but you have to show a little interest,

00:17:01.533 --> 00:17:08.604
an inclination that you want to be completely cleansed from within.

00:17:09.357 --> 00:17:17.915
You don’t know how profound this question is.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.844
To fix this we have to work very hard.

00:17:20.203 --> 00:17:28.413
Earlier, people would do many physical exercises;
listen to the orders of their guru.

00:17:28.564 --> 00:17:32.362
They would do a lot of things

00:17:32.481 --> 00:17:34.687
but they would never achieve the depth.

00:17:35.059 --> 00:17:37.325
But you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:17:37.676 --> 00:17:39.890
It should not be difficult for you.

00:17:40.036 --> 00:17:42.838
So now I will only say that

00:17:42.948 --> 00:17:45.523
you should learn to look into yourselves.

00:17:45.901 --> 00:17:48.051
It will be a lot of fun.

00:17:48.139 --> 00:17:50.220
Till now, it is alright,

00:17:50.365 --> 00:17:54.087
but I do not know what you have started doing.

00:17:54.325 --> 00:17:56.616
You keep a watch on yourself.

00:17:56.864 --> 00:17:59.489
You will see how this whole thing works

00:17:59.756 --> 00:18:02.438
and you will be enjoying it

00:18:02.859 --> 00:18:08.054
and start laughing at yourself and exclaim ‘what to say?’

00:18:08.711 --> 00:18:12.663
When this happens, you will start manifesting innocence within you.

00:18:13.064 --> 00:18:16.270
This is the Bala Leela of Shri Krishna.
(Childlike playfulness)

00:18:16.834 --> 00:18:29.585
Once you get bathed in this innocence
your eyes will become very steady.

00:18:29.953 --> 00:18:32.473
On your own you will start understanding yourself.

00:18:32.952 --> 00:18:38.150
Actually, the defect lies within us only.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.258
Looking at the defects of others,

00:18:41.594 --> 00:18:43.178
how can we fix our own defects?

00:18:43.203 --> 00:18:46.091
A very simple straightforward question is

00:18:46.364 --> 00:18:53.089
“If something falls on our sari and we do not remove it,

00:18:53.826 --> 00:18:56.579
and if we abuse or blame someone else,

00:18:56.656 --> 00:19:00.463
it won’t just go away, will it?

00:19:00.831 --> 00:19:02.997
This much intelligence we all have.

00:19:03.254 --> 00:19:06.087
But we don’t use that intelligence.

00:19:06.545 --> 00:19:09.878
And for this you should all use this intelligence.

00:19:14.609 --> 00:19:21.967
If anyone has not understood this
you can ask questions, in Marathi also.

00:19:43.104 --> 00:19:47.019
At least you should ask some questions.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:11.106
Now see, the attention is going inside and we are pushing it

00:20:11.362 --> 00:20:15.725
further but it should happen spontaneously.

00:20:16.226 --> 00:20:20.856
The attention should have the habit of going inwards by itself.

00:20:32.627 --> 00:20:35.777
I know that you have many questions to ask.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.731
We have a lot of confusion within us,

00:20:38.914 --> 00:20:41.546
there is no doubt about it.

00:20:42.095 --> 00:20:44.648
But the questions are very subtle.

00:20:45.078 --> 00:20:47.484
There is no end to it.

00:20:49.011 --> 00:20:52.218
Always, there is a question of rising above all this.

00:20:52.358 --> 00:20:55.022
Now, people say, ‘Mother, how can we rise above all this?’

00:20:55.157 --> 00:20:56.897
Meditation.

00:20:57.170 --> 00:21:00.702
What to say about meditation?

00:21:00.929 --> 00:21:02.833
You have to meditate on your own selves.

00:21:02.936 --> 00:21:08.251
You have to see your own selves, that, where is your brain going?

00:21:09.989 --> 00:21:11.213
And where are you going?

00:21:11.238 --> 00:21:13.850
Slowly you will get cleansed.

00:21:14.181 --> 00:21:17.236
Today is of great importance.

00:21:17.449 --> 00:21:25.146
The incarnation of Shri Krishna has done a great deal of cleansing for us

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.848
and He has helped us a lot.

00:21:28.066 --> 00:21:31.565
His coming on the earth made a lot of difference.

00:21:31.833 --> 00:21:38.643
The awakening of Kundalini has also gone smoothly

00:21:38.752 --> 00:21:40.672
on account of His blessings.

00:21:40.953 --> 00:21:43.968
Please try to look at yourselves.

00:21:44.321 --> 00:21:47.027
You should not be annoyed with

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:51.466
yourselves and you should not be annoyed with others either.

00:21:53.743 --> 00:21:55.385
It will be very joyous.

00:21:56.137 --> 00:21:59.216
This is the Krishna Puja.

00:22:02.524 --> 00:22:07.549
If you have any other questions,

00:22:32.729 --> 00:22:35.419
alright, you can ask Me….

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:39.988
What to say….

00:23:02.285 --> 00:23:05.181
Any other questions?

00:23:07.851 --> 00:23:10.848
Comment from Sahaja Yogi: Everyone is in nirvichar.

00:23:13.834 --> 00:23:17.136
What’s the question?……

00:23:21.204 --> 00:23:25.457
Sahaja Yogi: Everyone is sitting in nirvichar.

00:23:27.393 --> 00:23:28.559
Shri Mataji: Come closer.

00:23:28.601 --> 00:23:33.347
Sahaja Yogi: How do you attain
nirchvichar(thoughtlessness) in meditation?

00:23:45.545 --> 00:23:47.402
Shri Mataji: In meditation?

00:23:48.077 --> 00:23:52.924
There is no vichar (thoughts) during meditation.

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:57.906
Why should thoughts come in meditation?

00:23:58.361 --> 00:24:01.744
You are not to seek anything during meditation.

00:24:01.928 --> 00:24:05.183
It is only to be felt within.

00:24:05.408 --> 00:24:11.372
It is you who have to discriminate whether
you have realised this or not during meditation.

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:15.607
In meditation, first you will come to know your own mistakes,

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:19.035
where you were wrong,

00:24:19.187 --> 00:24:21.880
and where you were right.

00:24:22.063 --> 00:24:24.813
When you start realising your own mistakes,

00:24:25.036 --> 00:24:27.617
then you are on the right track.

00:24:27.761 --> 00:24:33.924
When you look at yourself in the mirror, you see yourself.

00:24:35.286 --> 00:24:38.216
What is the use of seeing others?

00:25:04.114 --> 00:25:09.550
Sahaja Yogi: How do we protect ourselves
from the clutches of the false gurus?

00:25:09.616 --> 00:25:10.655
What to say….

00:25:10.907 --> 00:25:18.155
How do we protect ourselves
from the clutches of the false gurus?

00:25:19.882 --> 00:25:22.560
Shri Mataji: Why did you have to go to a false guru?

00:25:24.203 --> 00:25:26.242
You tell me first,

00:25:27.901 --> 00:25:29.554
why did you go to a false guru?

00:25:30.051 --> 00:25:33.876
What attracted you to go to the false guru?

00:25:34.484 --> 00:25:36.428
How did you go there?

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:39.431
You must ask yourself this first.

00:25:39.614 --> 00:25:43.205
Then you will realise that you ignored the evils of that false guru.

00:25:43.316 --> 00:25:46.982
The trouble with us is,

00:25:47.838 --> 00:25:50.632
we always like to see others in the mirror.

00:25:54.447 --> 00:26:01.000
Then how will you identify your own faults
if you start to see others in the mirror?

00:26:01.209 --> 00:26:04.140
That is what you didn’t protect yourself from.

00:26:04.209 --> 00:26:08.516
Now, in the past I have already given lectures on false gurus

00:26:08.638 --> 00:26:11.648
where I have clearly talked about their evildoings

00:26:11.794 --> 00:26:14.338
and how they take one for a ride.

00:26:14.725 --> 00:26:17.540
It is their business to entrap you all.

00:26:17.676 --> 00:26:20.377
There are different types of business which they adopt.

00:26:20.551 --> 00:26:26.203
Out of that, gurus also have a business to entrap you

00:26:26.595 --> 00:26:28.451
and you are trapped.

00:26:29.158 --> 00:26:31.486
From this, one must realise

00:26:31.591 --> 00:26:34.115
which trap we have fallen into.

00:26:34.301 --> 00:26:44.932
We have filled our brains with the badhas (negativities) of the false gurus.

00:26:47.926 --> 00:26:52.579
Now if you can tell me any of those badhas,

00:27:00.822 --> 00:27:02.891
then I can tell you…..

00:27:14.852 --> 00:27:20.178
Now if you know one or two of these badhas,
you let me know.

00:27:21.023 --> 00:27:22.204
The false gurus’ badhas.

00:27:22.229 --> 00:27:23.916
Now what do these badhas actually do?

00:27:24.356 --> 00:27:32.074
First they focus their attention on your pocket.
Isn’t it?

00:27:33.511 --> 00:27:37.198
As they start doing this, then you must understand

00:27:37.412 --> 00:27:40.861
that their intentions are different.

00:27:41.127 --> 00:27:45.151
But it is all on the gross level.

00:27:46.428 --> 00:27:50.713
On the subtler level, in fact,

00:27:51.229 --> 00:27:53.821
there are many

00:27:55.519 --> 00:28:00.516
who wouldn’t want to entrap you,

00:28:01.148 --> 00:28:05.799
but they would try to project their own importance.

00:28:06.728 --> 00:28:09.175
And for this reason

00:28:11.154 --> 00:28:13.601
they become gurus.

00:28:14.133 --> 00:28:18.017
It is like this, that one projects his importance.

00:28:18.795 --> 00:28:26.834
So you must watch all this and be critical about it.

00:28:27.402 --> 00:28:30.529
Then it will forsake you.

00:28:30.831 --> 00:28:35.265
But most of the people absorb their badhas, their ego, their anger,

00:28:35.694 --> 00:28:38.553
their physical health

00:28:38.855 --> 00:28:42.034
and many more aspects that you absorb from the guru.

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:49.613
Like these gurus,

00:28:49.772 --> 00:28:55.411
when they fall sick, their shadow starts reflecting within you.

00:28:56.274 --> 00:28:57.813
For this reason,

00:28:58.162 --> 00:29:00.599
you must analyse yourself

00:29:00.808 --> 00:29:05.239
and look at yourself, that, what have I received from this guru?

00:29:11.178 --> 00:29:14.051
This is very important.

00:29:14.469 --> 00:29:19.659
Then when there is a cleansing of yourself,

00:29:20.184 --> 00:29:22.074
you will see that it benefits you to a great extent.

00:29:22.571 --> 00:29:24.771
Why did you go to a guru

00:29:24.826 --> 00:29:31.767
when you were seeking for your own spiritual ascent?

00:29:32.971 --> 00:29:36.718
You went to a guru to know him but you were in turn entrapped.

00:29:37.009 --> 00:29:42.445
This guru is such a guru,and you yourself
should know how to protect yourself from him.

00:29:42.615 --> 00:29:45.146
You should stay away from them.

00:29:45.922 --> 00:29:49.564
I had been to many such gurus just to see them and what they do,

00:29:49.702 --> 00:29:52.083
and how they tempt and attract people.

00:29:52.335 --> 00:29:57.580
And with what they entrap people.

00:29:58.142 --> 00:30:04.126
So the first thing I saw was
that these people find your own weaknesses,

00:30:04.576 --> 00:30:06.893
that what weakness you have

00:30:07.676 --> 00:30:09.866
If this doesn’t work then they put badhas into you

00:30:10.541 --> 00:30:13.953
The badhas are of various types.

00:30:15.143 --> 00:30:20.882
Out of these badhas you must first learn
to detect what type of badhas

00:30:20.954 --> 00:30:23.297
he has put into you that you are unable to get rid of.

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:27.239
The greatest badha that they put into you is FEAR.

00:30:28.182 --> 00:30:31.864
It keeps on frightening you,

00:30:32.576 --> 00:30:37.631
that ‘if you leave me, such and such thing will happen to you.'

00:30:37.787 --> 00:30:39.945
This type of fear creeps within you.

00:30:40.208 --> 00:30:42.993
It doesn’t have much strength in it.

00:30:43.361 --> 00:30:45.273
But it keeps on frightening you.

00:30:45.963 --> 00:30:52.415
When this fear comes,you must say to it, ‘yes, I know it’.

00:30:53.963 --> 00:30:59.114
With this fear the human beings
keep on going round and round the guru.

00:31:00.424 --> 00:31:02.797
For that Shri Krishna is there,

00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:07.021
Who drives out this fear from everyone.

00:31:24.887 --> 00:31:26.942
Do you have any other questions?

00:31:27.339 --> 00:31:32.761
Sahaja Yogi: Everyone is in nirvichar (thoughtlessness)

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:34.283
What to say….

00:31:34.357 --> 00:31:39.888
Sahaja Yogi: Everyone is in nirvichar (thoughtlessness)

00:31:51.062 --> 00:31:54.390
Saying that everyone is in vichar (thoughts)

00:31:54.455 --> 00:31:57.558
now we have to go beyond vichar (thoughts).

00:31:58.651 --> 00:32:01.748
Sahaja Yogi reaffirms: No Mother it’s nirvichar (thoughtlessness)

00:32:01.883 --> 00:32:03.375
Nirvichar.

00:32:04.696 --> 00:32:06.743
How did that happen?

00:32:32.939 --> 00:32:39.091
You have organised such a nice Krishna Puja

00:32:39.677 --> 00:32:48.038
that I also keep wondering.

00:32:48.567 --> 00:32:52.120
How is the environment?

00:33:04.463 --> 00:33:06.415
Is it OK?…

00:33:06.639 --> 00:33:14.230
Yes, it is peaceful and calm…..

00:33:23.149 --> 00:33:24.759
peaceful…..

00:33:25.601 --> 00:33:27.601
Now better.

00:33:29.554 --> 00:33:32.887
A person who can witness himself laughing,

00:33:33.089 --> 00:33:34.541
that is perfect.

00:33:35.519 --> 00:33:38.250
One who laughs at others,

00:33:38.288 --> 00:33:41.143
his attention is in another direction.

00:33:41.416 --> 00:33:50.079
Again, one who can witness and laugh at himself, and his own environment

00:34:01.187 --> 00:34:03.450
and aspect

00:34:09.079 --> 00:34:10.968
he is perfect.

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:21.047
Endless blessings.
