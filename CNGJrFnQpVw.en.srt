1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,268
8o Dia do Navaratri, Mumbai, India, 1979-0929

2
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:05,855
Shri Vijay Merchant, Mr. Rakure,

3
00:00:06,055 --> 00:00:12,010
all the Sahaja Yogis who have come here

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,032
to express their love for Me

5
00:00:15,232 --> 00:00:21,955
and all the rest of the people who are in the search of truth.

6
00:00:22,156 --> 00:00:28,757
It was really a very gracious of Shri Merchant to come

7
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:34,192
and inaugurate this book.

8
00:00:34,393 --> 00:00:37,714
I have been from My childhood watching his cricket.

9
00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:41,500
I must say I’m quite a big cricket fan Myself.

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,611
I think cricket is the game which is really Sahaja,

11
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:51,946
between one extreme of football and
another boring game of golf.

12
00:00:52,146 --> 00:00:56,394
And I always have been appreciating the way he has been

13
00:00:56,594 --> 00:01:00,490
managing our teams and has been such a good captain to our country

14
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,600
and I’ve been admiring him,
the way he has been able to handle

15
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:10,083


16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,121
the glory in the field of cricket.

17
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:10,217
Even after that, instead of wasting his life like

18
00:01:10,418 --> 00:01:14,100
all other successful people of this life in retirement,

19
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,448
he’s doing such a great work, and such a feeling he has

20
00:01:17,649 --> 00:01:21,522
for all the downtrodden and the poor people of this country

21
00:01:21,722 --> 00:01:25,817
shows that he is a very sensitive personality.

22
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:28,897


23
00:01:26,017 --> 00:01:32,599
I’m very thankful to him the way he is being kind to all of us

24
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,691
and have been here and spoke to us about his own work.

25
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:42,479
I agree with him entirely that the downtrodden

26
00:01:40,693 --> 00:01:44,320


27
00:01:42,679 --> 00:01:47,248
or the ones who are not so well off as we are

28
00:01:47,449 --> 00:01:51,605
or, we can say, the one who is not such a good batsman,

29
00:01:51,805 --> 00:01:55,751
the weaker one, has to be helped and sustained by the stronger one.

30
00:01:55,951 --> 00:02:00,091
This is exactly what we are doing in Sahaja Yoga.

31
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:02,932
What we are doing in Sahaja Yoga is that

32
00:02:03,132 --> 00:02:06,074
we are reaching to the roots of poverty.

33
00:02:06,274 --> 00:02:09,911
We are not just trying to do the, do the patchwork of

34
00:02:10,111 --> 00:02:14,537
just improving the material conditions of people.

35
00:02:14,737 --> 00:02:17,054
Because you have seen in the world people there

36
00:02:17,254 --> 00:02:20,966
have been very affluent in the countries like Switzerland and Sweden

37
00:02:21,167 --> 00:02:24,196
where people are very affluent and they are committing suicide.

38
00:02:24,397 --> 00:02:28,242
The maximum number of suicides are coming from Sweden.

39
00:02:28,442 --> 00:02:31,966
I’ve informed you last time that we had some people coming

40
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:37,299
from Sweden and their vibrations were something like the dead bodies.

41
00:02:37,499 --> 00:02:41,374
We have to know the roots of our troubles first of all.

42
00:02:41,574 --> 00:02:45,593
If we just try to treat the symptoms, we cannot go too far.

43
00:02:45,793 --> 00:02:50,623
And maybe that we may cure one symptom, but may cure another symptom.

44
00:02:50,824 --> 00:02:55,923
I’ll give you a very simple
example of My husband’s sensitivity

45
00:02:56,124 --> 00:02:59,750
to his organization which is World Shipping Corporation.

46
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:05,513
He is another philanthropic gentleman and he wanted to do a lot of good

47
00:03:05,714 --> 00:03:09,833
for the drivers who were in the organization. And he said,

48
00:03:10,034 --> 00:03:15,470
"Their pay is very little and the women and the men are really

49
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:19,093
living in substandard conditions, we must do something about them."

50
00:03:19,294 --> 00:03:21,628
And so he started raising their pay.

51
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:28,134
After three months or so suddenly I had a call from a lady,

52
00:03:28,335 --> 00:03:33,069
she said, "We are the wives of the drivers and we want to come and see You.

53
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:35,503
" I said, "It’s a good idea. You all must come and see Me,"

54
00:03:35,704 --> 00:03:39,799
because in Shipping Corporation, I always had a very motherly role

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,172
towards all the employees, and they would always come and tell Me

56
00:03:43,373 --> 00:03:46,578
if they thought that it would be difficult to talk to My husband.

57
00:03:46,778 --> 00:03:51,942
Now they came round and they told Me that, "It’s nice that he has given us lot of pay,

58
00:03:52,142 --> 00:03:55,791
but do our drivers know how to handle that additional money?

59
00:03:55,991 --> 00:03:59,186
Now they have taken to drinking, they have taken to bad women

60
00:03:59,387 --> 00:04:03,546
and they are not even giving us money what they were giving us."

61
00:04:03,746 --> 00:04:09,058
What is the basic root of poverty? It is not God, it is human beings.

62
00:04:09,324 --> 00:04:13,414
The human beings who have got too much ambitions,

63
00:04:13,614 --> 00:04:19,595
human beings who are all the time running after the mirage of money.

64
00:04:19,795 --> 00:04:23,326
In money-oriented societies of the West have created

65
00:04:23,527 --> 00:04:27,546
this kind of mentality, even in the East

66
00:04:27,747 --> 00:04:31,919
where people want to have everything of the world. They want to have today the house,

67
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,133
tomorrow the car, day after tomorrow the
helicopter. Maybe they may like to have

68
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:39,585
even a big jumbo jet to themselves.

69
00:04:39,786 --> 00:04:44,742
How do you curb this? Unless and until you bring those people

70
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:50,214
who are en-massing these money too much
and extracting the money from the poor

71
00:04:50,414 --> 00:04:54,925
and on the other hand the poor who do not feel responsible enough

72
00:04:55,125 --> 00:05:00,648
to create work for themselves and not to be parasites on anyone.

73
00:04:58,105 --> 00:05:03,193


74
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:03,816
These two factors must to be tackled at the same time,

75
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:06,912
and Sahaja Yoga is the only way you can win.

76
00:05:07,112 --> 00:05:10,915
Now you must have seen that in Sahaja Yoga

77
00:05:11,115 --> 00:05:15,600
mostly the people of about middle class people are there.

78
00:05:15,801 --> 00:05:17,828
Very poor people are also there;

79
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:20,762
we have lots of poor people from the villages.

80
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:24,094
In the Sahaja Yoga when the Kundalini rises,

81
00:05:24,294 --> 00:05:26,917
you get your own power within yourselves

82
00:05:27,117 --> 00:05:29,470
by which you feel satisfied,

83
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:34,238
and this too much of hankering after money, position and all that dies out a

84
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:38,215
nd such a person himself thinks of the others who are around,

85
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:43,849
because on his vibrations he can feel
and he can feel the needs of others.

86
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:49,424
As far the sick that are poor or sick who are the rich,

87
00:05:49,624 --> 00:05:55,462
even diseases like cancer and leprosy
can only be cured by Sahaja Yoga.

88
00:05:55,662 --> 00:05:58,457
We treat people without taking a single pie.

89
00:05:58,657 --> 00:06:04,323
We have cured thousands of people all over the
world without taking a single pie from them,

90
00:06:04,523 --> 00:06:08,935
whether they are poor, rich or anything.

91
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:11,626
Mentally there are many people who are disturbed.

92
00:06:11,826 --> 00:06:15,676
For example, most of the money of the poor goes for drinking.

93
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:20,932
They drink like fishes, they waste their energy in drinking.

94
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:23,438
You might think I am talking on prohibition,

95
00:06:23,638 --> 00:06:26,921
but drinking is against human sustenance.

96
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:29,481
Now you cannot ask people to stop drinking.

97
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:32,211
It’s an impossibility. If you tell anybody

98
00:06:32,411 --> 00:06:35,330
that, "You stop drinking," he cannot stop.

99
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,627
Most of the poor people so-called poor, sometimes I feel,

100
00:06:38,827 --> 00:06:41,666
have lots of money to waste on drinking.

101
00:06:41,866 --> 00:06:44,254
We must see to the other side of the poor also.

102
00:06:44,454 --> 00:06:48,363
By giving them more money, are we really making them responsible,

103
00:06:45,857 --> 00:06:51,205


104
00:06:48,564 --> 00:06:53,312
are we making them better people, are we making them good citizens

105
00:06:53,512 --> 00:06:59,318
and are we making them one with the divine force?

106
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:05,655
So supposing a poor man comes to you and he is a drinking fellow.

107
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:08,297
Now you cannot tell him, "Don’t drink." " If you tell him, "Don’t drink,"

108
00:07:08,498 --> 00:07:11,086
he’ll hit you hard. If there are ten more,

109
00:07:11,287 --> 00:07:15,063
that’s more danger, and such prohibition has never worked.

110
00:07:15,263 --> 00:07:18,039
But you’ll be amazed to know that in the Amart Nagar district

111
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:20,987
there are thousands of people who have just given up

112
00:07:21,188 --> 00:07:24,229
drinking just like that by getting this realization.

113
00:07:24,429 --> 00:07:29,126
Now what is realization? If we understand in one stroke,

114
00:07:29,326 --> 00:07:32,647
you will know that this is what we should have first

115
00:07:32,847 --> 00:07:34,881
and then other things should follow.

116
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:39,710
Is that you by realization you get to know yourself.

117
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:43,823
You get to know your own powers, which are again within.

118
00:07:44,024 --> 00:07:49,608
You get to know what are you and you get to know the absolute.

119
00:07:49,809 --> 00:07:53,428
As you said, is very true; without getting
to Self-realization,

120
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:57,014
you will not know what is really right and what is wrong.

121
00:07:57,214 --> 00:07:59,146
There cannot be any absolute value

122
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,905
because you have not yet discovered your absolute.

123
00:08:02,105 --> 00:08:04,828
Everything is relative, that’s why there is a confusion.

124
00:08:05,028 --> 00:08:07,979
But supposing you discover, supposing I say,

125
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:13,915
keep it as a hypothesis, you discover your Spirit, the absolute.

126
00:08:14,116 --> 00:08:17,791
If you discover that then relative whatever are the problems

127
00:08:17,992 --> 00:08:20,900
you know through the vibrations that are flowing through you,

128
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,439
you can make out whether it is right or wrong.

129
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,368
If it is wrong the vibrations will stop immediately.

130
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:32,678
I’ve been saying that cancer cannot be cured by anything else,

131
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,667
but Sahaja Yoga and we have cured cancer of so many people.

132
00:08:36,867 --> 00:08:39,976
The other day I went to Saskar and you know there were

133
00:08:40,176 --> 00:08:42,580
lots of sick people around.

134
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:47,023
Out of them was a blind man from the year when he was five years,

135
00:08:47,224 --> 00:08:50,716
and for about twenty-five years, he has been a blind person.

136
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:53,732
His both the pupils were turned upside down

137
00:08:53,932 --> 00:08:57,121
and he could not see anything; he could only see the white retina.

138
00:08:57,321 --> 00:09:00,178
And he started seeing within ten minutes time.

139
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:03,052
If you want to write you can write to the President’s sister

140
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:05,543
and ask the secretary, Mr. Madapa.

141
00:09:05,744 --> 00:09:08,608
There I have also cured our President, no doubt,

142
00:09:08,808 --> 00:09:11,318
but apart from that there was a little girl

143
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:15,351
who was the daughter of a sentry who was a Muslim gentleman.

144
00:09:15,551 --> 00:09:18,561
And he called and he said that, "This girl cannot see at all,

145
00:09:16,898 --> 00:09:20,400


146
00:09:18,762 --> 00:09:21,774
Mother, and she’s a young girl of seven-eight years

147
00:09:21,974 --> 00:09:25,160
and she’s lost her eye sight because there was a fire."

148
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,860
She also within five or ten minutes started seeing so clearly

149
00:09:29,061 --> 00:09:33,275
that she saw My husband’s suit which had white lines on it.

150
00:09:33,475 --> 00:09:37,647
Sahaja Yoga is the only way you can solve the troubles

151
00:09:37,848 --> 00:09:41,031
of the downtrodden. There’s no other way out,

152
00:09:41,231 --> 00:09:44,035
because unless and until you are realized

153
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:48,302
you have, must have seen how these social workers react.

154
00:09:48,502 --> 00:09:51,737
I have also been in the social work and I have seen their reaction,

155
00:09:51,938 --> 00:09:54,335
how they behave, because they are imperfect.

156
00:09:54,536 --> 00:09:57,230
Till this instrument is put to the mains,

157
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,692
this cannot work out properly. It is still an imperfect instrument.

158
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:06,104
You must get the instrument perfected. It’s all ready.

159
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:09,681
The instrument is within you; it is just to be perfected.

160
00:10:09,881 --> 00:10:13,262
All your diseases can be cured. Now what about poverty?

161
00:10:13,462 --> 00:10:16,421
Poverty, as you know is the Lakshmi tattwa.

162
00:10:16,621 --> 00:10:20,963
It resides in your Nabhi. The Lakshmi tattwa resides in your Nabhi

163
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:24,527
and if your Nabhi chakra is cured, your Lakshmi tattwa is cured.

164
00:10:24,727 --> 00:10:31,158
In our country because of black magic, because of horrible gurus,

165
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:33,639


166
00:10:31,358 --> 00:10:36,466
because of all kinds of bad things we think about others

167
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:40,787
as far as Nabhi is concerned, because of fasting, nonsensical fasting,

168
00:10:40,987 --> 00:10:44,694
because of going to temples and taking bad prasadas,

169
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:49,624
all these things have caused the augmentation of the Nabhi chakra.

170
00:10:49,824 --> 00:10:52,161
Now here the Sahaja Yogis who have come

171
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:57,180
have definitely gained materially. All of them have gained materially.

172
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,412
If there is anybody can stand up and tell Me, "We have not gained."

173
00:11:00,612 --> 00:11:02,790
We have had very poor people coming to us.

174
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,248
We had one gentleman coming to us from Kalwa.

175
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:13,047
He told Me, "Mother, since I have joined this Sahaja Yoga,

176
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:14,770


177
00:11:13,248 --> 00:11:16,197
I’m very well off." I was surprised because every time, he would come

178
00:11:16,398 --> 00:11:20,062
from Kalwa bring Me a garland. I said, "What happened?"

179
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:27,172
He said, "I don’t know, but I was walking
on the soil of my land every morning

180
00:11:27,372 --> 00:11:31,020
and suddenly one day a gentleman came to me and told me

181
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:37,290
that, ‘Will you please sell me your this clay from your land,

182
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,667
at such and such price?’ Because it’s a very good clay,

183
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,713
very good for brick make.

184
00:11:43,914 --> 00:11:48,302
And he started paying me such a lot."
"Perhaps you do not realize, sir,

185
00:11:48,502 --> 00:11:52,051
that these vibrations are dynamic, are blessings of God

186
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:55,787
and once you touch them, the Lakshmi tattwa improves just like that.

187
00:11:55,987 --> 00:11:59,631
"You don’t have to bother to look after the downtrodden or anything.

188
00:11:59,831 --> 00:12:03,531
Anybody, whether he is rich or whether he is poor,

189
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:07,747
when he comes to Sahaja Yoga, he gets related to the whole.

190
00:12:05,912 --> 00:12:09,719


191
00:12:07,947 --> 00:12:12,502
This sensitivity in all the people who are doing work,

192
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:16,552
good work for helping the poor, becomes really enlightened.

193
00:12:16,752 --> 00:12:19,301
Only by touching a thing, you can cure people.

194
00:12:19,501 --> 00:12:21,659
By just standing there, you can stop accidents.

195
00:12:21,859 --> 00:12:25,273
By just thinking about it, you can manage the whole show.

196
00:12:25,473 --> 00:12:28,368
It is that is how, by going deeper into it,

197
00:12:28,568 --> 00:12:32,185
with a deeper being, that is the whole, the Viraat,

198
00:12:32,386 --> 00:12:34,976
you learn that you are a part of the whole.

199
00:12:35,176 --> 00:12:38,355
Only you have to be connected; the dynamic starts flowing in.

200
00:12:38,555 --> 00:12:42,465
But of course you cannot become very rich in Sahaja Yoga, neither very poor,

201
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:46,179
because as in the nature, these imbalances are never there.

202
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,362
The other day I told you, a human being grows up to, say, certain height

203
00:12:49,563 --> 00:12:52,129
of five, six, seven feet; that’s all, not more.

204
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,045
Even the, say, a mango tree grows up to a certain point.

205
00:12:55,246 --> 00:12:58,593
The nature looks after. God looks after you. He does everything.

206
00:12:58,794 --> 00:13:03,582
Let us be connected only to God and He looks after this.

207
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,195
I agree that philanthropic work is a very essential part

208
00:13:07,396 --> 00:13:09,367
of a country like ours.

209
00:13:09,568 --> 00:13:14,019
But we have to know that philanthropy is not the job of God.

210
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,494
Human beings have created poverty.

211
00:13:15,138 --> 00:13:22,736


212
00:13:16,694 --> 00:13:18,882
Human beings have created all these problems.

213
00:13:19,082 --> 00:13:22,351
So they should solve their own problems. It is not the work of God.

214
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,369
God’s work is to bless you, to gift you.

215
00:13:25,569 --> 00:13:28,814
When you go to Him, when you enter into the Kingdom of God,

216
00:13:29,014 --> 00:13:31,841
He blesses you. Not too much, not too less,

217
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:36,075
but the satisfaction and the, and the joy of owning it.

218
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:38,859
Actually, we do not own anything.

219
00:13:36,898 --> 00:13:41,118


220
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:43,109
Whatever we own, so-called, is just a myth in our minds.

221
00:13:43,309 --> 00:13:48,824
Even in our poor people, we have
given them sometimes very wrong ideas,

222
00:13:47,674 --> 00:13:50,130


223
00:13:49,024 --> 00:13:51,996
and they have formed the sort of a group thinking they are very poor

224
00:13:52,196 --> 00:13:56,217
and they can assert a political pressure and all sorts of things.

225
00:13:56,418 --> 00:14:00,712
You have to be careful that when we want to do something for the poor,

226
00:14:00,913 --> 00:14:07,196
let us do it from the within and not from the without. Actually, this is such a wonderful country.

227
00:14:07,397 --> 00:14:10,140
Here you don’t need much. You have seen Me:

228
00:14:10,341 --> 00:14:13,471
I can sleep on the street; I can move about anywhere I like.

229
00:14:13,671 --> 00:14:17,255
There is no need to have too much. That’s why Gandhiji always said

230
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:23,350
that we should press on our sagara. He told all the gandhivad, Gandhi,

231
00:14:23,551 --> 00:14:26,406
gandhian people that you should have less. But what you find,

232
00:14:26,607 --> 00:14:29,985
most of the gandhivadis have the greatest amount of black money,

233
00:14:30,185 --> 00:14:33,852
the greatest amount of diamonds and the greatest amount of money.

234
00:14:34,052 --> 00:14:38,409
They might wear ordinary clothes but I have heard they are not.

235
00:14:38,609 --> 00:14:41,775
This heart has to be changed.

236
00:14:41,975 --> 00:14:46,718
Unless and until you change the heart of the people, unless and until

237
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:51,106
sincerely they really feel the way you feel, not only that

238
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,749


239
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,976
but they just feel it as an actual feeling within themselves.

240
00:14:55,176 --> 00:14:57,943
For example, if there’s a poor man standing before Me,

241
00:14:58,143 --> 00:15:01,004
immediately I can feel his Nabhi chakra.

242
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:03,941
I can put My hand on Nabhi chakra. I can solve his problem,

243
00:15:04,141 --> 00:15:06,569
just like this. It’s a fact, you know that.

244
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:09,578
All the Sahaja Yogis who are here, most of them are Sahaja Yogis,

245
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:12,632
will say that Mataji has done.

246
00:15:12,832 --> 00:15:17,299
The poorest of poorest can be touched by Lakshmi tattwa

247
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,516
and can be cured. That is the most important part,

248
00:15:20,716 --> 00:15:24,498
that his Lakshmi tattwa must be cured and not his money or materia.

249
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:27,379
Now the difference between Lakshmi tattwa and materia,

250
00:15:27,579 --> 00:15:30,681
you must find out. Lakshmi tattwa is a person.

251
00:15:30,881 --> 00:15:34,640
He may be just an ordinary driver, but he can be like a batcha.

252
00:15:34,841 --> 00:15:37,228
You see, we had a driver with us for many years.

253
00:15:37,428 --> 00:15:40,879
He was just like a batcha and I knew that he was like a king,

254
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:44,062
because he was a king in his previous life.

255
00:15:42,363 --> 00:15:45,875


256
00:15:44,262 --> 00:15:50,360
The way he was like a batcha,

257
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,196
that nothing would disturb him and everything would satisfy him.

258
00:15:54,396 --> 00:15:57,086
If you tell him that you have to wait for three hours he’ll wait.

259
00:15:57,287 --> 00:15:59,847
If you tell him you cannot stay here now, you can go

260
00:16:00,048 --> 00:16:02,937
and sleep anywhere, he’ll do. Whatever you tell him,

261
00:16:03,138 --> 00:16:06,973
he will not hesitate and he was such a happy personality.

262
00:16:07,173 --> 00:16:10,186
Now, the reason is, I would say he’s better than many rich people

263
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:13,125
who cannot sleep in the night and who are all the time thinking

264
00:16:13,326 --> 00:16:16,524
about dirty tricks that they are going to try and many of these

265
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:21,148
politicians who are just planning all the time all the dirty designs.

266
00:16:21,349 --> 00:16:23,537
We have to purify ourselves from within.

267
00:16:23,737 --> 00:16:27,720
Poverty is just a mere myth of that symptom.

268
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,551
Now to say that people are very much tortured,

269
00:16:31,751 --> 00:16:36,874
I know that they are being, of course, very much put down.

270
00:16:37,074 --> 00:16:42,265
But what is the solution you have? If
the solution is to give them some money,

271
00:16:42,465 --> 00:16:45,801
or to have them money wise or to just put little cure,

272
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:50,124
that is not going to help. You have to awaken their Lakshmi tattwa.

273
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:54,425
I am going to the essence, to the base of it, from where the problem comes in.

274
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:56,461


275
00:16:54,626 --> 00:17:00,749
Lakshmi stands with one hand like this, one
hand like this and with two kamala in Her hand,

276
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:06,493
and She is a woman with a very simple sari, white sari.

277
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:11,039
Be sure a Lakshmi pati, a person who has got Lakshmi,

278
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:16,749
the satisfaction of Lakshmi has always a way of giving.

279
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:20,626
All the time he is giving. If the Lakshmi tattwa

280
00:17:20,826 --> 00:17:24,179
of all these so-called multi-millionaires is awakened,

281
00:17:24,379 --> 00:17:27,751
they will be frightened of keeping all these black money with them

282
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:35,069
and extracting the blood of the poor. If the
Lakshmi tattwa of the poor is enlightened,

283
00:17:33,268 --> 00:17:37,139


284
00:17:35,269 --> 00:17:39,117
they’ll be ashamed of begging and being parasites.

285
00:17:39,317 --> 00:17:43,744
No use developing parasite tendencies into them.

286
00:17:43,945 --> 00:17:47,892
A parasite is to be hated like leprosy.

287
00:17:48,093 --> 00:17:50,863
In this country we have had enough of this beggary.

288
00:17:51,064 --> 00:17:55,992
Our leaders also have become greatest beggars of the world.

289
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:59,558


290
00:17:56,192 --> 00:17:58,769
All over the world if you go, you feel so ashamed.

291
00:17:58,969 --> 00:18:02,718
It does not matter if half of this country is damned,

292
00:18:02,918 --> 00:18:07,170
because they can be born again. But live with your self-respect.

293
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:11,133
This kind of beggary that is on and this kind of begging

294
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,948
that we are doing with other countries is so shameful for us,

295
00:18:15,148 --> 00:18:18,395
because God has given us such a blessing of this yoga bhoomi.

296
00:18:18,596 --> 00:18:23,052
What a mess we have made out of it by not understanding our own values,

297
00:18:23,252 --> 00:18:28,241
our own culture and our own heritage that we have got from God.

298
00:18:28,449 --> 00:18:31,735
This is the only country in the whole world which is yoga-oriented.

299
00:18:31,993 --> 00:18:34,154
Do you understand the importance of this country?

300
00:18:34,354 --> 00:18:38,153
Not only that it is yoga-oriented but also,

301
00:18:38,354 --> 00:18:43,160
also it is a punya bhoomi. Here all the great saints have come and lived.

302
00:18:43,361 --> 00:18:47,722
Even Zoroaster whom Parsees worship is nothing but an incarnation

303
00:18:48,022 --> 00:18:53,852
of Datattreya, and you know how we worship him in our Sahaja Yoga,

304
00:18:54,053 --> 00:18:56,702
how we worship Mohamed Sahib in our Sahaja Yoga,

305
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,064
how we understand where He stands within us.

306
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:03,533
The deeper, the intercurrence of all these problems

307
00:19:03,733 --> 00:19:08,146
of the whole world can be solved by you people, the Indians.

308
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:12,138
You are being blessed to be Indians in this country

309
00:19:12,339 --> 00:19:18,884
and not to feel so bad if you don’t have one helicopter or one transistor.

310
00:19:19,085 --> 00:19:24,391
Poverty is of the mind, I can tell you. It’s not more of eating or non-eating.

311
00:19:24,592 --> 00:19:28,311
If a person has a mind which is sickening, he may be the multi-millionaire

312
00:19:28,512 --> 00:19:32,288
still he’ll be crying, "I don’t
have this. I don’t have that."

313
00:19:32,489 --> 00:19:35,082
Nothing can satisfy human beings,

314
00:19:35,283 --> 00:19:38,201
and you know the economics law is such that,

315
00:19:38,402 --> 00:19:41,423
"No want is satiable in general."

316
00:19:41,624 --> 00:19:45,987
In particular, everything is satisfied but nobody is satisfied.

317
00:19:46,187 --> 00:19:51,241
With Sahaja Yoga you can give them satisfaction and self-respect.

318
00:19:51,442 --> 00:19:55,933
Develop their self-respect. Teach them how to come up,

319
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:59,514
not to look after them as just downtrodden.

320
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:05,122
I have had a very good opportunity of working for a blind school here.

321
00:20:05,322 --> 00:20:08,558
And the blind school people wanted to collect money and this and that and all that,

322
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:12,218
and I said, "Nothing doing. You
are not to make them begging girls.

323
00:20:12,418 --> 00:20:15,955
They can all work out something for themselves." They started working out.

324
00:20:16,156 --> 00:20:20,708
Then they made some nice things

325
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:24,307
and bed covers and this and that. So they said, "Now, who will
market?" I said, "You go all out to do the marketing for them."

326
00:20:24,508 --> 00:20:27,130
But then I told them that in Japan I was surprised

327
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,776
that the blind were taught massage.

328
00:20:29,977 --> 00:20:35,829
I said, "You give them realization and let them do massage.

329
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:40,791
If a realized blind person gives massaging, all these foreigners

330
00:20:40,992 --> 00:20:44,855
would be paying  them at least hundred rupees per massage, minimum.

331
00:20:45,056 --> 00:20:49,294
And if that person is blind, it’s much easier to do the massage."

332
00:20:49,494 --> 00:20:51,788
But the people could not accept this kind of a thing. They said,

333
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:54,870
"No, no, Mataji, then, You see, You should not give them realization."

334
00:20:55,071 --> 00:20:59,400
Here we lack the understanding of the depth of our problem.

335
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,180
They, they said, "Mataji, how can You give realization to these blind [too/people]?"

336
00:21:03,381 --> 00:21:05,553
And the blind people would have got it in no time.

337
00:21:05,754 --> 00:21:09,656
Only they could have been cured and they would have had this realization.

338
00:21:09,857 --> 00:21:13,790
But because that organization belongs to other great people

339
00:21:13,991 --> 00:21:17,282
of great thinking and wisdom, they would not accept such a situation

340
00:21:17,483 --> 00:21:22,971
where I would say, "All right, you bring all your
blind and I’ll try to give them their eyesight."

341
00:21:23,172 --> 00:21:25,633
They are not willing to accept this. I will tell you

342
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:31,282
a very simple example that I cured a leukemia of a little boy of ten years

343
00:21:31,482 --> 00:21:37,193
who was a patient of blood, blood cancer patient in Delhi.

344
00:21:37,394 --> 00:21:40,424
Of course, we never charge a single pie. No Sahaja Yogis allow

345
00:21:40,624 --> 00:21:44,861
to charge a single pie for whatever he does; you know that.

346
00:21:45,061 --> 00:21:47,693
Not a single pie. And this boy was cured.

347
00:21:47,894 --> 00:21:53,330
He was brought by Doctor Mulher, and Doctor
Mulher referred Me to the medical institute.

348
00:21:53,531 --> 00:21:59,107
The medical institute came to Me and just see what was their proposition,

349
00:21:59,307 --> 00:22:02,201
"You give us the list of people whom You have cured,

350
00:22:02,402 --> 00:22:05,184
how You have cured, where they live and all." I said, "For what?

351
00:22:05,385 --> 00:22:08,216
I’m not asking for any money. Nothing is selling here.

352
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:13,010
You are as if you are going into cross-examination,

353
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:16,561
as if I am out here for any donation from you.

354
00:22:16,761 --> 00:22:19,669
You just come and see for yourselves. I don’t write the names of people

355
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:23,089
whom I give food or how many morsels they have eaten.

356
00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:26,474
This is My love that is flowing. It’s My love that is working out.

357
00:22:23,985 --> 00:22:28,967


358
00:22:26,675 --> 00:22:29,219
You people can’t understand love. You want Me to write down

359
00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:32,839
all the people I have cured. I refuse to do it.

360
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,839
This is the way they look at a thing.

361
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,807
They do not know the power of love. For us now, it
is necessary first to generate the power of love

362
00:22:42,008 --> 00:22:47,657
through Sahaja Yoga. It is very easy. Sahaja Yoga is not the blessing

363
00:22:47,857 --> 00:22:52,608
of one year or one yuga but of all the yugas.

364
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:57,418
You have to get it. You have to get to know your Atma.

365
00:22:57,618 --> 00:23:02,301
You have to know your Self, and the Last Judgment is here now.

366
00:23:02,501 --> 00:23:06,034
There is no need to think of another Last Judgment coming in.

367
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,535


368
00:23:06,234 --> 00:23:08,625
Here, now, by knowing your Atma,

369
00:23:08,826 --> 00:23:11,364
you will get the power of God flowing through you,

370
00:23:11,564 --> 00:23:15,744
like when I put it to the mains, the power starts flowing through us.

371
00:23:15,944 --> 00:23:21,147
And then this power can communicate that dynamic power. What is this poverty?

372
00:23:21,348 --> 00:23:24,917
It’s at the Feet of that Lord.
You can just throw it away.

373
00:23:25,118 --> 00:23:29,497
I agree that going to temples and churches there is no God.

374
00:23:27,849 --> 00:23:31,446


375
00:23:29,698 --> 00:23:35,045
But even going to poor will not help, I can tell you this much today,

376
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:40,014
but going to the roots of poverty, by understanding why there is poverty

377
00:23:40,215 --> 00:23:42,712
and why human beings behave like this.

378
00:23:42,913 --> 00:23:46,331
You have to transform the whole thing. You are still in the flower state.

379
00:23:46,532 --> 00:23:50,555
You all have to become fruits. All of us have to become fruits today.

380
00:23:50,756 --> 00:23:55,420
If we are not fruits, we cannot solve the problem of our country

381
00:23:55,621 --> 00:23:59,375
and of another country. If this takes place,

382
00:23:59,575 --> 00:24:04,252
if this tremendous transformation takes place in our country today,

383
00:24:04,453 --> 00:24:09,386
then the whole world is going to be led by us, and in any case,

384
00:24:09,587 --> 00:24:13,056
it is going to be led, which I am sure, hundred per cent sure,

385
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:15,810


386
00:24:13,257 --> 00:24:15,870
that the time it’s coming when the whole world will have

387
00:24:16,071 --> 00:24:19,013
to listen to us on this point to solve their problems.

388
00:24:19,214 --> 00:24:21,569
There are countries, communist countries are there;

389
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,545
people have everything. I’ve been to all the countries. I’ve been to Russia.

390
00:24:24,746 --> 00:24:28,498
Those who talk of communism should go to Russia and see for themselves.

391
00:24:28,699 --> 00:24:32,027
Those who talk of capitalism should go to America and see for themselves

392
00:24:32,228 --> 00:24:35,474
how stupid and silly and useless people they have been,

393
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:40,214
how their society is finished.
Money cannot bring you happiness.

394
00:24:40,414 --> 00:24:45,012
If you want to make people happy, then awaken their Nabhi chakra,

395
00:24:45,212 --> 00:24:47,879
as they call it, or you can call it the Lakshmi tattwa.

396
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,491
And the Lakshmi tattwa can only be awakened,

397
00:24:50,691 --> 00:24:53,188
only be awakened through Sahaja Yoga,

398
00:24:53,388 --> 00:24:55,790
by which the whole country will be transformed.

399
00:24:55,990 --> 00:25:02,322
Like you go to a barren garden and you see
the garden absolutely in a barren condition.

400
00:25:02,523 --> 00:25:07,506
Suddenly water comes in and the power of the water generates

401
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:12,122
all that affluence, and suddenly you find the whole place

402
00:25:12,322 --> 00:25:15,415
bubbling with joy, and that’s what is going to happen

403
00:25:15,615 --> 00:25:19,069
to this our country, which people think as to be poor.

404
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:22,504
Still I would say we may be poor outwardly because we don’t have

405
00:25:22,704 --> 00:25:26,934
very good clothes maybe, according to them,
and we don’t have too many plastics with us.

406
00:25:27,135 --> 00:25:30,544
What is their affluence? It’s nothing but plastics and rubbers.

407
00:25:30,744 --> 00:25:33,540
They eat plastics and they sleep on rubbers.

408
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:38,407
They don’t even have so much of natural cotton with them.

409
00:25:38,607 --> 00:25:45,719
Our affluence is our yoga, is our power, our sustenance,

410
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,442
our humanity, and our humanity has to be sustained.

411
00:25:50,643 --> 00:25:54,323
We have to have many more people like Mr. Vijay Merchant

412
00:25:54,524 --> 00:25:57,823
who think of the whole, of the all the people who are suffering,

413
00:25:58,024 --> 00:26:01,103
but philanthropy of Sahaja Yoga is different

414
00:26:01,303 --> 00:26:05,757
because for Me who is the other?

415
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:08,751
When somebody is just a part and parcel of My being,

416
00:26:08,951 --> 00:26:14,059
itself my finger is paining; I’m just rubbing it and I must do it.

417
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:17,455
For that I don’t have to awaken people; they just get it.

418
00:26:15,705 --> 00:26:19,410


419
00:26:17,656 --> 00:26:19,846
You just stand near a person, you get a headache and you ask the person,

420
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:24,570


421
00:26:20,047 --> 00:26:21,891
"Have you got a headache?" "Yes."

422
00:26:22,092 --> 00:26:24,257
You rub your head and rub his head and just finish it off.

423
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:32,736
You just cannot help it because the macrocosm, the Viraat,

424
00:26:32,937 --> 00:26:38,878
informs you when you are one with it that, "see, the other fellow is suffering."

425
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:42,129
You become that. You become collectively conscious.

426
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:45,118
It is not a lecture or anything but it’s a becoming

427
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:47,504
within you that you start feeling on your fingers,

428
00:26:47,704 --> 00:26:51,023
on your fingertips, what are the centers catching,

429
00:26:51,223 --> 00:26:54,305
what is the problem of the other person, how to cure it, what to do it.

430
00:26:54,506 --> 00:26:59,506
Everything, all this knowledge is given in Sahaja Yoga, absolutely free.

431
00:26:59,706 --> 00:27:02,665
Out of so many who are sitting here, you can ask how many

432
00:27:02,866 --> 00:27:06,118
have been suffering from diseases, have been cured completely,

433
00:27:06,318 --> 00:27:08,898
and since they have been realized not a single pie

434
00:27:09,099 --> 00:27:11,595
has been given to the doctors.

435
00:27:11,795 --> 00:27:15,345
It is not necessary to look after your health,

436
00:27:15,545 --> 00:27:19,510
not necessary to do much about it. We have had people who have had

437
00:27:19,711 --> 00:27:22,646
three heart attacks and now they are going strong.

438
00:27:22,847 --> 00:27:25,624
We have had people who had leukemia, who had all kinds of diseases.

439
00:27:25,825 --> 00:27:28,792
Today you won’t believe they ever had that disease

440
00:27:28,993 --> 00:27:32,388
because now the inside is completely into balance,

441
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:37,202
integrated and blessed by God’s divine power within you.

442
00:27:37,402 --> 00:27:40,235
This is our heritage. We have to cash on it.

443
00:27:40,436 --> 00:27:43,027
And by this only we are going to remove the poverty,

444
00:27:43,227 --> 00:27:47,789
one day you will see, and not by patching up few things.

445
00:27:47,989 --> 00:27:51,519
I would request Mr. Vijay Merchant and we have another

446
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:55,765
great social worker with us, is Gidubai Kotak,

447
00:27:54,601 --> 00:27:57,090


448
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:59,106
that you should pay little more attention to our Sahaja Yoga

449
00:27:59,306 --> 00:28:01,571
and see the dynamics of the Sahaja Yoga.

450
00:28:01,771 --> 00:28:05,380
You’ll be amazed how one person, the person who spoke to you

451
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,753
just now, was from Rahuri, these two persons.

452
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:12,027
They have given realization to ten thousands people.

453
00:28:12,227 --> 00:28:15,261
Just go and see their houses. Just go and see their children.

454
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:17,781
They are bubbling with joy, with happiness,

455
00:28:17,981 --> 00:28:21,104
and you do not see any poverty in their hearts at all.

456
00:28:21,304 --> 00:28:23,961
Their hearts have been enriched and they are doing so well.

457
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:28,605
Because the energy comes within you,
the Saraswati tattwa is also enlightened

458
00:28:28,805 --> 00:28:34,953
and you start thinking as to what is to be
done and how to, how to make your life happy.

459
00:28:35,153 --> 00:28:38,248
But money is not everything; food is not everything.

460
00:28:38,449 --> 00:28:43,646
Unless and until you get to know your Atma, you can never be happy.

461
00:28:43,846 --> 00:28:46,765
So go to the roots and it’s so easy. You don’t have to pay anything,

462
00:28:46,965 --> 00:28:49,264
you don’t have to have many organization, nothing. It just works,

463
00:28:49,465 --> 00:28:55,387
just like this. So why worry and why just think of something terrible?

464
00:28:55,588 --> 00:28:57,872
Now more we are ahead, talk to Gidubai also

465
00:28:58,072 --> 00:29:02,461
that they were enamored by one guru who were showing some miracles.

466
00:29:02,662 --> 00:29:07,302
And I, I had met somebody from Morvi who came to see Me, and I told him

467
00:29:07,503 --> 00:29:10,746
that you just don’t have anything to do with this horrible fellow,

468
00:29:10,947 --> 00:29:16,744
because a day will come when Kalki is
at work and there will be destruction.

469
00:29:16,945 --> 00:29:21,275
He wouldn’t listen to Me. I went to Andhra. For your information I tell you,

470
00:29:21,476 --> 00:29:27,868
I went to Andhra. I told to Andhra people
that, "You don’t grow this tobacco."

471
00:29:28,069 --> 00:29:31,193
In Andhra there are two types of people: one who are making lots of money;

472
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:35,106
the other are the so-called poor who are doing lot of black magic.

473
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:38,121
I talked to both of them. I told them, "Don’t do black magic

474
00:29:38,322 --> 00:29:41,322
because if you do black magic Lakshmi tattwa will disappear."

475
00:29:41,523 --> 00:29:45,297
If the black magic comes from this side, the Lakshmi goes from the other side.

476
00:29:45,498 --> 00:29:47,900
And they just didn’t listen to Me. And I talked to these people

477
00:29:48,101 --> 00:29:53,585
who were growing tobacco. They wouldn’t listen. There are on three tapes,

478
00:29:53,786 --> 00:30:00,955
there is a lecture, where I said that the sea is the incarnation of Datattreya.

479
00:29:59,281 --> 00:30:02,747


480
00:30:01,156 --> 00:30:07,069
It will take a respite, and believe Me.
And that’s what has happened with it.

481
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:13,585
We have to understand that God knows all of us. He knows us in masses,

482
00:30:13,786 --> 00:30:17,601
and He knows where we are going and what we are doing.

483
00:30:17,802 --> 00:30:21,842
Your Bombay has escaped recently a very big drought.

484
00:30:22,042 --> 00:30:26,144
But please take heed and take to God.

485
00:30:26,344 --> 00:30:30,428
It is no question of going to Himalayas, of course, and no question of running away from it.

486
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:36,601
But get it within yourself, try, as
many as you can bring in here,

487
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:40,897
if the saints are there. Those who are Sahaja Yogis are saints.

488
00:30:41,097 --> 00:30:46,155
Then God definitely will bless you, definitely will bless you.

489
00:30:46,355 --> 00:30:50,415
And the same people who are realized today have done tremendous work

490
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:55,294
in the villages. They have emancipated
so many villages without any money,

491
00:30:55,494 --> 00:30:58,805
without anything. When I go in the villages I’m really surprised

492
00:30:59,005 --> 00:31:04,818
how people get cured, how they are helped, how they get energetic,

493
00:31:05,018 --> 00:31:08,381
how they understand things. It’s most amazing.

494
00:31:08,581 --> 00:31:13,243
So the power of all the powers, that is the power of God’s Love,

495
00:31:13,443 --> 00:31:19,688
let us take to it. Let us take advantage of
it and leave everything in the hands of God.

496
00:31:19,889 --> 00:31:23,631
Only get Him into everyone you think who is suffering.

497
00:31:23,831 --> 00:31:27,401
You get Me hundred people who are suffering, I will see to them.

498
00:31:27,601 --> 00:31:30,548
Today if the whole hall was filled I would have cured all of them.

499
00:31:30,748 --> 00:31:32,909
You know that I have done it. It is not difficult.

500
00:31:33,109 --> 00:31:37,274
It is no boasting. It’s a fact. It’s a fact.

501
00:31:37,474 --> 00:31:41,769
It works in five minutes, for so many people can get it.

502
00:31:41,969 --> 00:31:46,662
But people do not want to face reality
and they do not want to attend to it.

503
00:31:46,862 --> 00:31:50,176
Now we have already so many Sahaja Yogis in Bombay. So you can imagine

504
00:31:50,377 --> 00:31:53,576
I’ve worked here for nine years. We have
some more of course in the outer centers

505
00:31:53,777 --> 00:31:57,623
but here in the center we have so many or little more. So you can see

506
00:31:54,993 --> 00:31:59,097


507
00:31:57,824 --> 00:32:02,805
how people are. And the work you are doing from outside,

508
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:08,232
it’s all like a blind person going doing this work, that work, that work, that work.

509
00:32:08,433 --> 00:32:10,877
Politicians also think they are doing great work.

510
00:32:11,078 --> 00:32:13,686
All right, they are doing. Social workers are also doing

511
00:32:13,887 --> 00:32:16,824
great work. Everybody’s doing. But there’s no coordination,

512
00:32:17,024 --> 00:32:21,084
there’s no integration and there’s no satisfaction of what one is doing.

513
00:32:21,285 --> 00:32:24,382
The reason is all of them belong to the one whole

514
00:32:24,582 --> 00:32:27,563
and they have not yet connected with the whole, which one has to do.

515
00:32:27,764 --> 00:32:30,317
We are finding our wholesomeness all over the world,

516
00:32:30,518 --> 00:32:32,828
whether we are Indians, Americans or anything.

517
00:32:33,028 --> 00:32:35,566
We are all just trying to find out our wholesomeness,

518
00:32:35,766 --> 00:32:40,479
and the answer is Sahaja Yoga. It is Sahaja Yoga.

519
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,798
There’s no other answer to anyone of these problems.

520
00:32:43,998 --> 00:32:47,503
Today I am telling you, again you can tell Me afterwards.

521
00:32:47,703 --> 00:32:50,235
You give Me your problems, you tell Me who are the downtrodden.

522
00:32:49,563 --> 00:32:56,608


523
00:32:50,436 --> 00:32:52,892
Let Me see. Let Me see who are the downtrodden.

524
00:32:53,092 --> 00:32:55,565
Now you, somebody wanted Me to go and see the fishermen. I said,

525
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:59,519
"All right, I’ll go and see them." I’m sure if I, they get realization,

526
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:02,503


527
00:32:59,719 --> 00:33:03,669
their fishery will improve, definitely, hundred per cent; I’m sure of it.

528
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:07,178
Everything improves because God’s blessings are there

529
00:33:07,378 --> 00:33:11,438
and God has got the six qualities which makes Him Bhagwan.

530
00:33:11,638 --> 00:33:16,312
It’s one of them is Shubha, Auspicious. Another is Kalyan.

531
00:33:16,513 --> 00:33:20,902
Another is Aishwary [GW: Ishwari?]. Like these the six qualities of God.

532
00:33:21,102 --> 00:33:23,898
These six qualities emit from the being,

533
00:33:24,098 --> 00:33:26,529
and once you face it, you get it.

534
00:33:26,729 --> 00:33:30,021
You want to do Kalyan; all right, then face people to God,

535
00:33:30,221 --> 00:33:32,402
and this is the way by which you can face it.

536
00:33:32,602 --> 00:33:35,656
You don’t have to organize churches and temples or anything.

537
00:33:35,856 --> 00:33:41,294
It’s just the energy which has to flow, Shakti that has to flow.

538
00:33:41,494 --> 00:33:45,064
Like you can see a wood is lying there, has nothing.

539
00:33:45,264 --> 00:33:48,709
But if you enlighten it, it gives you light, fire, everything.

540
00:33:48,909 --> 00:33:52,868
In the same way enlightenment is the only way to solve the problem,

541
00:33:53,068 --> 00:33:57,531
and all of us should try to enlighten as many people as possible.

542
00:33:57,731 --> 00:34:00,116
Our work, of course, is more for the middle class

543
00:34:00,316 --> 00:34:03,264
because the extremes do not take to us.

544
00:34:03,465 --> 00:34:05,487
But when the middle course increases,

545
00:34:05,687 --> 00:34:08,979
the river flows on both the sides. She can feed on the both the sides.

546
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:11,895
Gradually the both the sides can also join [them],

547
00:34:12,095 --> 00:34:14,665
but the depth is in the center, in the madhya marga,

548
00:34:14,865 --> 00:34:17,711
and there it works out. It is only the middle class,

549
00:34:17,912 --> 00:34:20,822
which can work it out because they have the values necessary,

550
00:34:21,023 --> 00:34:24,824
they have the feelings necessary and they have the blessings necessary

551
00:34:25,025 --> 00:34:28,942
because they lead a very normal life. Once they learn their swimming,

552
00:34:29,143 --> 00:34:31,523
they must know themselves before helping others.

553
00:34:31,723 --> 00:34:34,380
You must help yourself, you must become yourself,

554
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,396
before you help others. Once they achieve that,

555
00:34:37,596 --> 00:34:41,265
they can easy help, easy help others and that has been done.

556
00:34:41,465 --> 00:34:43,646
It is such a silent work of Sahaja Yoga

557
00:34:43,846 --> 00:34:46,044
that we have not maintain any statistics.

558
00:34:46,244 --> 00:34:49,114
We have not yet been able to say. Here there are people who have given

559
00:34:49,315 --> 00:34:53,341
realization to minimum of ten thousands or eight thousands people.

560
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:55,580
There are people who have cured thousands of people

561
00:34:55,781 --> 00:34:57,798
who are sitting here just like ordinary people,

562
00:34:57,998 --> 00:35:01,670
but they don’t know about it and they’ll say, "We didn’t do, Mother.

563
00:35:01,871 --> 00:35:05,836
It just worked. It was just happening. It happened."

564
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:08,812
So this is what is a very dynamic force. I would request

565
00:35:09,013 --> 00:35:13,710
all the social workers to open their eyes to this tremendous discovery

566
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:17,748
that has come to our country and to see for themselves what it is like,

567
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:22,913
what it means. It transforms a personality into such a dynamic web

568
00:35:23,113 --> 00:35:27,661
that an ordinary boy can become a great cricket player.

569
00:35:27,862 --> 00:35:30,770
An ordinary musician can become a great musician.

570
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:36,430
An ordinarily dull boy can become a first class student.

571
00:35:36,631 --> 00:35:41,582
It has happened. There are many who will say it has happen in their cases.

572
00:35:41,783 --> 00:35:43,865
So many things have happen like this,

573
00:35:44,065 --> 00:35:48,250
and so we have to depend on the mercy of God for this.

574
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:51,378
Only thing is we have to desire and ask for it.

575
00:35:51,579 --> 00:35:55,526
I think, the other day I had a talk with one of the political leaders.

576
00:35:55,727 --> 00:35:58,984
I said, "Politics without adhyatma has no life."

577
00:35:59,184 --> 00:36:03,447
In the same way I’ll say, "Social work without adhyatma has no meaning."

578
00:36:03,647 --> 00:36:06,638
Without adhyatma, without the Atma in it,

579
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:09,695
without the Spirit of God in it, you are doing it

580
00:36:09,895 --> 00:36:13,756
because in you something is dying, in you something is feeling,

581
00:36:13,957 --> 00:36:18,445
that what is feeling in you is the part of the whole.

582
00:36:18,645 --> 00:36:21,620
So know the whole and you’ll be so dynamic.

583
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:25,662
You’ll be so great and the whole thing will flow from you

584
00:36:25,862 --> 00:36:28,996
and you can really help thousands of people.

585
00:36:29,196 --> 00:36:33,050
I hope, it’s a good thing today we have two great social workers here

586
00:36:33,251 --> 00:36:36,269
and I put forward to them this kind of a proposition.

587
00:36:36,469 --> 00:36:39,285
So on behalf of all the Sahaja Yogis, we render all our services.

588
00:36:39,485 --> 00:36:41,587
Any number of downtrodden people you have got,

589
00:36:41,787 --> 00:36:45,090
you send them over to our centers and we’ll see to them.

590
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:50,854
May God bless you all.

591
00:36:52,556 --> 00:36:55,323


592
00:36:55,523 --> 00:36:58,787


593
00:36:58,988 --> 00:37:01,871


594
00:37:02,071 --> 00:37:07,358


595
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:11,210


596
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:14,683


597
00:37:14,883 --> 00:37:22,542


598
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:28,730


599
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:33,517


600
00:37:33,717 --> 00:37:36,775


601
00:37:36,975 --> 00:37:39,991


602
00:37:40,192 --> 00:37:46,472


603
00:37:46,673 --> 00:37:50,917


604
00:37:51,118 --> 00:37:58,400


605
00:37:58,601 --> 00:38:02,970


606
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:05,219


607
00:38:05,419 --> 00:38:09,090


608
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:12,571


609
00:38:12,771 --> 00:38:16,011


610
