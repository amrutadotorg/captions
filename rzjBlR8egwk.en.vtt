WEBVTT

04:10.167 --> 04:20.871
Today we have gathered here to do Puja to Bhairavnath.

04:22.079 --> 04:25.924
I think we have not understood

04:26.076 --> 04:31.572
the significance of Bhairavnath

04:31.732 --> 04:41.415
who runs, and up and down on the Ida Nadi.

05:11.465 --> 05:18.301
Ida Nadi is the Nadi of Chandrama, is of the moon.

05:23.727 --> 05:34.167
So, this is a channel for us to cool down.

05:40.983 --> 05:48.861
So the work of Bhairavnathji is to cool us down.

05:54.764 --> 05:59.234
For example, people have a hot temper,

05:59.394 --> 06:03.667
with their ego, with their liver, whatever it is.

06:12.135 --> 06:19.154
And if a person is in a big temper,

06:19.314 --> 06:25.166
then Bhairavnath plays tricks on that person

06:25.371 --> 06:27.922
to cool him down.

06:36.254 --> 06:43.271
He organises everything under his own control

06:43.431 --> 06:46.765
with ganas help, with Ganapati's help,

06:46.925 --> 06:51.791
to cool down your temperament, to give you a balance.

07:04.191 --> 07:08.263
So, if somebody is a very hot-tempered person,

07:08.966 --> 07:14.444
and he crosses all the limits of his temper,

07:14.604 --> 07:17.209
then somehow or other,

07:17.369 --> 07:20.459
Bhairavnath will organize,

07:20.619 --> 07:23.736
also with the help of Hanumana,

07:23.896 --> 07:30.136
to show that this stupidity of anger is no good.

07:51.687 --> 07:56.773
So, for example, people who are depressed

07:56.933 --> 07:59.568
or who become left-sided,

07:59.728 --> 08:05.694
Hanumana tries to help them to come out of it.

08:05.854 --> 08:12.054
No doubt, but also Bhairavnath helps them

08:12.214 --> 08:16.173
very much more to come out of it.

08:28.579 --> 08:36.537
Now, a person who is left-sided cannot be collective.

08:41.342 --> 08:44.556
It is very difficult for a person

08:44.716 --> 08:48.441
who is very left-sided,

08:48.601 --> 08:54.354
who is all the time feeling very sad,

08:54.514 --> 08:57.790
unhappy and worried,

08:57.950 --> 09:01.995
cannot enjoy the fun of collectivity.

09:14.507 --> 09:18.023
While a hot-tempered person, a right-sided person,

09:18.183 --> 09:20.460
does not enjoy any collectivity,

09:20.620 --> 09:23.113
doesn't allow anybody to enjoy collectivity, no doubt,

09:23.273 --> 09:28.341
but tries to be in the collective that it can assert.

09:42.843 --> 09:46.073
Because such a person tries to show the superiority,

09:46.233 --> 09:48.096
is something superior.

09:48.256 --> 09:53.560
Naturally he cannot enjoy the collective.

10:02.075 --> 10:06.276
On the contrary, the person who is depressed,

10:06.436 --> 10:08.423
all the time thinks,

10:08.583 --> 10:11.180
"Nobody loves me, nobody cares for me,

10:11.340 --> 10:13.430
I'm so depressed," this, that,

10:13.590 --> 10:16.734
all the time expecting from others something,

10:16.894 --> 10:22.187
also cannot enjoy the collective.

10:39.937 --> 10:42.259
Such a left-sided person will find

10:42.419 --> 10:48.842
everything is something unhappy.

10:57.061 --> 10:59.715
Like the other day, I went to Moscow.

10:59.867 --> 11:03.941
There was a lady with us who was a Sahaja Yogini,

11:04.101 --> 11:07.507
left-sided Sahaja Yogini.

11:14.580 --> 11:17.922
So, we went to have our food

11:18.082 --> 11:23.028
and it started raining and they couldn't get a taxi,

11:31.295 --> 11:34.852
but then a car came in and we went there.

11:39.141 --> 11:41.954
Then they said that

11:42.114 --> 11:45.242
"You are very late so you have to sit on the other side,

11:45.402 --> 11:49.367
you have to take the seats which were more expensive."

11:58.667 --> 12:00.488
So this lady started saying,

12:00.648 --> 12:05.771
"What all problems, no taxi, it is raining

12:05.931 --> 12:09.163
and we can't get a seat."

12:18.988 --> 12:21.066
I said, "This is all fun;

12:21.226 --> 12:23.655
this is not something a problem."

12:23.815 --> 12:27.384
This 'problema' word should be given up.

12:36.206 --> 12:38.854
This is a new word I have learned,

12:39.014 --> 12:43.363
because 'problem' we used to use only for geometry

12:43.523 --> 12:45.787
in our young age.

12:56.285 --> 12:59.804
Now, this sort of a attitude, negative attitude,

12:59.964 --> 13:02.753
to find everything negative

13:02.913 --> 13:09.234
is the way we really spoil our left side.

13:18.283 --> 13:20.881
But then a gentleman who had invited us came

13:21.041 --> 13:26.608
and he said, "We are sitting on the other side waiting for you.'

13:36.386 --> 13:39.044
So we went to the other side, enjoyed nice food,

13:39.204 --> 13:40.614
everything was fine.

13:40.774 --> 13:43.038
I said, "See now, you were only counting

13:43.198 --> 13:47.430
how many negative things there are,

13:54.967 --> 13:58.668
and you were not seeing the fun."

14:04.170 --> 14:06.088
So she asked Me, "What should I do?" I said,

14:06.248 --> 14:09.376
"You take Bhairava's name,

14:13.975 --> 14:15.963
sit with your left hand towards the photograph

14:16.123 --> 14:17.850
and right hand on the Mother Earth

14:18.010 --> 14:22.055
and that's how all your bhoots of negativity will go away."

14:28.646 --> 14:31.884
So, Bhairava is, always has a light in His hand,

14:32.044 --> 14:35.174
always light in His hand.

14:40.160 --> 14:43.823
And He runs up and down

14:44.267 --> 14:51.113
Ida Nadi to make light for you to see that there's nothing negative.

14:58.304 --> 15:02.971
And this negativity comes to us by many ways.

15:06.949 --> 15:10.901
One of the negativities are that,

15:11.061 --> 15:14.378
"This is mine",

15:18.022 --> 15:27.744
like, "My child, my husband, my property, my ..."

15:32.687 --> 15:35.020
So then, you see, once you get attached

15:35.180 --> 15:38.359
in this manner, what you find,

15:38.519 --> 15:44.754
that your children also become negative.

15:50.663 --> 15:58.492
But if you want to be positive, it is very easy.

16:01.845 --> 16:07.269
And for that you should see, 'Where is your attention?"

16:10.629 --> 16:13.204
Are you only seeing problema

16:13.364 --> 16:17.539
or you are seeing some fun in it?

16:26.247 --> 16:31.510
There are people who cannot make fun out of anything.

16:34.662 --> 16:40.936
If it's a sunny day they'll cry, "Oh God, what a sunny day!"

16:45.880 --> 16:50.451
and if it is a day with clouds they will say,

16:50.611 --> 16:52.683
"Oh, what a day!"

16:56.562 --> 16:59.608
Nothing can please them.

17:00.869 --> 17:07.071
But to enjoy the positivity in every negativity

17:07.231 --> 17:10.796
is the capacity of a Sahaja Yogi.

17:18.079 --> 17:24.647
The negativity doesn't exist - it's an ignorance.

17:27.212 --> 17:30.800
Also, it's not ignorance, because ignorance also doesn't exist.

17:30.960 --> 17:34.158
If everything is the All-Pervading Power,

17:34.318 --> 17:38.474
then how can there be ignorance?

17:44.374 --> 17:50.818
But supposing, in the folds of this power,

17:50.978 --> 17:53.255
if you hide, run away,

17:53.415 --> 17:57.642
you will say that there is negativity.

18:04.980 --> 18:07.131
Like, you hide yourself in a cave,

18:07.291 --> 18:12.696
close it properly, and say that there is no sun.

18:17.656 --> 18:22.085
So those people who cannot become collective,

18:22.245 --> 18:28.181
are either right-sided or left- sided but more left-sided.

18:35.925 --> 18:42.767
But left- sided people can be collective in negativity.

18:47.519 --> 18:51.651
They say, there is a very big fraternity of bhoots.

18:54.064 --> 19:00.505
Ah, you see some drunkards sitting together.

19:03.581 --> 19:08.728
They are saying, "See there're so many problem, ecological problem."

19:08.888 --> 19:11.027
They are drunkards, all drunk,

19:11.187 --> 19:15.033
and "There are problems of so other kinds.

19:15.193 --> 19:19.258
When will this end?"

19:28.700 --> 19:31.202
So the another one says, "Wait, wait, wait.

19:31.362 --> 19:36.451
I've heard that the whole world is going to collapse very soon."

19:46.553 --> 19:47.889
Then the third one says,

19:48.049 --> 19:52.323
"Thank God! We are going to be collapsed, finished."

19:54.853 --> 20:01.826
Then fourth one says, "But what will happen to our pubs?"

20:06.251 --> 20:12.436
They say, "It's all right. If we are not existing, what does it matter?"

20:15.679 --> 20:21.592
That's how the fraternity of the bhoots act.

20:23.129 --> 20:25.682
They cannot see fun at all,

20:25.750 --> 20:29.035
they cannot enjoy at all,

20:32.424 --> 20:34.878
and they become very,

20:34.982 --> 20:37.452
sort of think they are very meditative,

20:37.588 --> 20:41.418
they are some higher people, they are something superior

20:41.404 --> 20:44.548
in negativity.

20:56.570 --> 21:01.669
But, end of these people is that they become lunatics,

21:04.472 --> 21:10.230
while the end of the right-sided - they become idiotic.

21:14.206 --> 21:18.160
Once I went to a lunatic asylum,

21:20.506 --> 21:23.802
and while going there I met a lady,

21:23.962 --> 21:26.670
and she was quite all right, I mean,

21:26.767 --> 21:29.195
I thought she was a quite all right woman,

21:29.283 --> 21:32.579
so I started talking to her.

21:40.262 --> 21:42.271
And she started talking very wisely:

21:42.431 --> 21:44.810
"See, my brother- in- law is there, and

21:44.970 --> 21:48.289
I think it isn't necessary that he should be helped,

21:48.449 --> 21:50.156
and we should not do this, that..."

21:50.316 --> 21:54.413
All kinds of things she was telling Me,

22:02.024 --> 22:05.544
showing Me, as if she was very nice and kind

22:05.589 --> 22:09.161
and no one loves her.

22:15.224 --> 22:19.155
And she said, "I'm very insecure" and this and that.

22:22.799 --> 22:26.683
Suddenly the doctor came in

22:27.116 --> 22:30.694
and she started abusing him, shouting at him.

22:30.854 --> 22:34.040
I said, "What's this?"

22:40.676 --> 22:43.478
So the doctor sent for people that,

22:43.638 --> 22:45.187
"Catch hold of this woman!"

22:45.347 --> 22:49.521
He told Me, "She's the most violent lunatic

22:55.933 --> 22:58.664
and why are You talking to her?"

22:59.346 --> 23:05.188
I did have a headache but I didn't know she was a lunatic.

23:09.377 --> 23:12.072
Maybe in My presence, her bhoots might have a little bit

23:12.232 --> 23:14.290
run away and were playing tricks,

23:14.450 --> 23:19.019
but you can see that, clearly.

23:24.936 --> 23:27.516
So, this emotional attachment is too much,

23:27.676 --> 23:31.566
and to emotionally, to worry about somebody, that

23:31.726 --> 23:36.244
"You see, "This is my child, this is my this thing,

23:36.404 --> 23:38.080
this is this and this is that,"

23:38.240 --> 23:40.888
and all the time wasting your precious life

23:41.048 --> 23:46.179
in these things is not the way a Sahaja Yogi should live.

23:57.075 --> 23:59.425
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot become collective,

23:59.585 --> 24:03.365
then know that he is not a Sahaja Yogi.

24:09.831 --> 24:11.522
So, one has to know that

24:11.682 --> 24:15.869
this is the work of Bhairavnath within us.

24:19.233 --> 24:22.888
Another work that He gives us light in darkness is that,

24:23.048 --> 24:30.188
that He, He destroys all the bhoots within us.

24:36.352 --> 24:39.648
And all kinds of bhootish ideas

24:41.173 --> 24:45.927
and funny ideas about attachments

24:49.369 --> 24:52.699
and also the depressiveness.

24:54.354 --> 24:55.909
So, today we are, I am very happy

24:56.069 --> 24:59.809
that we are worshipping Shri Bhairava

24:59.969 --> 25:05.337
because He is very much connected with Ganesha.

25:11.225 --> 25:14.727
As you know Shri Ganesha is at the Mooladhara

25:14.887 --> 25:18.996
and while Bhairava moves onto the left side

25:19.156 --> 25:23.180
and goes to the right side.

25:29.684 --> 25:34.092
So, all kinds of conditionings, all kinds of habits,

25:34.252 --> 25:40.945
can be conquered through the help of Bhairavnath.

25:48.535 --> 25:53.672
In Nepal we have a very huge, big Bhairavnath’s statue

25:53.832 --> 25:57.733
which is really Swayambhu.

26:01.496 --> 26:04.011
And people are more left-sided,

26:04.171 --> 26:07.737
so they are afraid of Bhairavnath.

26:11.816 --> 26:15.701
So, if somebody has a bad habit, say, of stealing,

26:15.861 --> 26:18.568
they take him to the, to in front of Bhairavnath

26:18.728 --> 26:24.113
and put His light there, make a flame.

26:33.037 --> 26:34.945
I mean, the police takes them.

26:35.058 --> 26:41.437
And then they ask him, "Now, say before Bhairavnath, confess it."

26:46.760 --> 26:51.826
And they confess what wrong they have done.

26:51.986 --> 27:01.678
So, He protect us, also from doing wrong things,

27:01.785 --> 27:05.339
sly things like thieving.

27:12.812 --> 27:15.874
Whatever we think we can do secretly, can be hidden,

27:16.034 --> 27:20.267
but you cannot hide it from Bhairavnath.

27:26.599 --> 27:31.677
If you don't change, then He exposes you completely.

27:34.341 --> 27:40.225
That's how He has exposed  all the horrible false gurus.

27:44.034 --> 27:48.146
So, today we are here to worship

27:48.306 --> 27:50.748
this great Deity of Bhiaravnatha

27:50.908 --> 27:55.481
who incarnated on this earth later on,

28:03.440 --> 28:06.948
ultimately as Mahavira also.

28:08.082 --> 28:12.840
So, He stands on the gate of hell

28:15.785 --> 28:19.886
and stops people from falling into hell.

28:24.409 --> 28:26.808
But if you want to go to hell,

28:26.968 --> 28:30.096
if it is your desire, is your willpower like that working,

28:30.256 --> 28:31.803
that I should go to hell, then He says,

28:31.963 --> 28:35.852
'All right, you can go.'

28:42.093 --> 28:48.563
But as you know, now the hell is also full of people.

28:52.382 --> 28:58.464
So, it’s better that we should try to fight our negativity

28:58.624 --> 29:05.528
and become fun-loving, enjoying others, loving others,

29:17.977 --> 29:21.849
not worrying about what others are doing to you,

29:22.009 --> 29:27.273
but only thinking what good you can do to others.

29:36.303 --> 29:43.755
So today's special Puja for Bhairavnath we offer,

29:46.788 --> 29:53.918
to give us a sense to laugh, to enjoy, to have fun.

30:02.476 --> 30:06.046
May God bless you all.
