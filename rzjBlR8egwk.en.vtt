00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:20.871
Today we have gathered here to do Puja to Bhairavnath.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.924
I think we have not understood

00:04:26.076 --> 00:04:31.572
the significance of Bhairavnath

00:04:31.732 --> 00:04:41.415
who runs, and up and down on the Ida Nadi.

00:05:11.465 --> 00:05:18.301
Ida Nadi is the Nadi of Chandrama, is of the moon.

00:05:23.727 --> 00:05:34.167
So, this is a channel for us to cool down.

00:05:40.983 --> 00:05:48.861
So the work of Bhairavnathji is to cool us down.

00:05:54.764 --> 00:05:59.234
For example, people have a hot temper,

00:05:59.394 --> 00:06:03.667
with their ego, with their liver, whatever it is.

00:06:12.135 --> 00:06:19.154
And if a person is in a big temper,

00:06:19.314 --> 00:06:25.166
then Bhairavnath plays tricks on that person

00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:27.922
to cool him down.

00:06:36.254 --> 00:06:43.271
He organises everything under his own control

00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:46.765
with ganas help, with Ganapati's help,

00:06:46.925 --> 00:06:51.791
to cool down your temperament, to give you a balance.

00:07:04.191 --> 00:07:08.263
So, if somebody is a very hot-tempered person,

00:07:08.966 --> 00:07:14.444
and he crosses all the limits of his temper,

00:07:14.604 --> 00:07:17.209
then somehow or other,

00:07:17.369 --> 00:07:20.459
Bhairavnath will organize,

00:07:20.619 --> 00:07:23.736
also with the help of Hanumana,

00:07:23.896 --> 00:07:30.136
to show that this stupidity of anger is no good.

00:07:51.687 --> 00:07:56.773
So, for example, people who are depressed

00:07:56.933 --> 00:07:59.568
or who become left-sided,

00:07:59.728 --> 00:08:05.694
Hanumana tries to help them to come out of it.

00:08:05.854 --> 00:08:12.054
No doubt, but also Bhairavnath helps them

00:08:12.214 --> 00:08:16.173
very much more to come out of it.

00:08:28.579 --> 00:08:36.537
Now, a person who is left-sided cannot be collective.

00:08:41.342 --> 00:08:44.556
It is very difficult for a person

00:08:44.716 --> 00:08:48.441
who is very left-sided,

00:08:48.601 --> 00:08:54.354
who is all the time feeling very sad,

00:08:54.514 --> 00:08:57.790
unhappy and worried,

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:01.995
cannot enjoy the fun of collectivity.

00:09:14.507 --> 00:09:18.023
While a hot-tempered person, a right-sided person,

00:09:18.183 --> 00:09:20.460
does not enjoy any collectivity,

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:23.113
doesn't allow anybody to enjoy collectivity, no doubt,

00:09:23.273 --> 00:09:28.341
but tries to be in the collective that it can assert.

00:09:42.843 --> 00:09:46.073
Because such a person tries to show the superiority,

00:09:46.233 --> 00:09:48.096
is something superior.

00:09:48.256 --> 00:09:53.560
Naturally he cannot enjoy the collective.

00:10:02.075 --> 00:10:06.276
On the contrary, the person who is depressed,

00:10:06.436 --> 00:10:08.423
all the time thinks,

00:10:08.583 --> 00:10:11.180
"Nobody loves me, nobody cares for me,

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.430
I'm so depressed," this, that,

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:16.734
all the time expecting from others something,

00:10:16.894 --> 00:10:22.187
also cannot enjoy the collective.

00:10:39.937 --> 00:10:42.259
Such a left-sided person will find

00:10:42.419 --> 00:10:48.842
everything is something unhappy.

00:10:57.061 --> 00:10:59.715
Like the other day, I went to Moscow.

00:10:59.867 --> 00:11:03.941
There was a lady with us who was a Sahaja Yogini,

00:11:04.101 --> 00:11:07.507
left-sided Sahaja Yogini.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.922
So, we went to have our food

00:11:18.082 --> 00:11:23.028
and it started raining and they couldn't get a taxi,

00:11:31.295 --> 00:11:34.852
but then a car came in and we went there.

00:11:39.141 --> 00:11:41.954
Then they said that

00:11:42.114 --> 00:11:45.242
"You are very late so you have to sit on the other side,

00:11:45.402 --> 00:11:49.367
you have to take the seats which were more expensive."

00:11:58.667 --> 00:12:00.488
So this lady started saying,

00:12:00.648 --> 00:12:05.771
"What all problems, no taxi, it is raining

00:12:05.931 --> 00:12:09.163
and we can't get a seat."

00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:21.066
I said, "This is all fun;

00:12:21.226 --> 00:12:23.655
this is not something a problem."

00:12:23.815 --> 00:12:27.384
This 'problema' word should be given up.

00:12:36.206 --> 00:12:38.854
This is a new word I have learned,

00:12:39.014 --> 00:12:43.363
because 'problem' we used to use only for geometry

00:12:43.523 --> 00:12:45.787
in our young age.

00:12:56.285 --> 00:12:59.804
Now, this sort of a attitude, negative attitude,

00:12:59.964 --> 00:13:02.753
to find everything negative

00:13:02.913 --> 00:13:09.234
is the way we really spoil our left side.

00:13:18.283 --> 00:13:20.881
But then a gentleman who had invited us came

00:13:21.041 --> 00:13:26.608
and he said, "We are sitting on the other side waiting for you.'

00:13:36.386 --> 00:13:39.044
So we went to the other side, enjoyed nice food,

00:13:39.204 --> 00:13:40.614
everything was fine.

00:13:40.774 --> 00:13:43.038
I said, "See now, you were only counting

00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:47.430
how many negative things there are,

00:13:54.967 --> 00:13:58.668
and you were not seeing the fun."

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:06.088
So she asked Me, "What should I do?" I said,

00:14:06.248 --> 00:14:09.376
"You take Bhairava's name,

00:14:13.975 --> 00:14:15.963
sit with your left hand towards the photograph

00:14:16.123 --> 00:14:17.850
and right hand on the Mother Earth

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:22.055
and that's how all your bhoots of negativity will go away."

00:14:28.646 --> 00:14:31.884
So, Bhairava is, always has a light in His hand,

00:14:32.044 --> 00:14:35.174
always light in His hand.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.823
And He runs up and down

00:14:44.267 --> 00:14:51.113
Ida Nadi to make light for you to see that there's nothing negative.

00:14:58.304 --> 00:15:02.971
And this negativity comes to us by many ways.

00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:10.901
One of the negativities are that,

00:15:11.061 --> 00:15:14.378
"This is mine",

00:15:18.022 --> 00:15:27.744
like, "My child, my husband, my property, my ..."

00:15:32.687 --> 00:15:35.020
So then, you see, once you get attached

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:38.359
in this manner, what you find,

00:15:38.519 --> 00:15:44.754
that your children also become negative.

00:15:50.663 --> 00:15:58.492
But if you want to be positive, it is very easy.

00:16:01.845 --> 00:16:07.269
And for that you should see, 'Where is your attention?"

00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:13.204
Are you only seeing problema

00:16:13.364 --> 00:16:17.539
or you are seeing some fun in it?

00:16:26.247 --> 00:16:31.510
There are people who cannot make fun out of anything.

00:16:34.662 --> 00:16:40.936
If it's a sunny day they'll cry, "Oh God, what a sunny day!"

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:50.451
and if it is a day with clouds they will say,

00:16:50.611 --> 00:16:52.683
"Oh, what a day!"

00:16:56.562 --> 00:16:59.608
Nothing can please them.

00:17:00.869 --> 00:17:07.071
But to enjoy the positivity in every negativity

00:17:07.231 --> 00:17:10.796
is the capacity of a Sahaja Yogi.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:24.647
The negativity doesn't exist - it's an ignorance.

00:17:27.212 --> 00:17:30.800
Also, it's not ignorance, because ignorance also doesn't exist.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.158
If everything is the All-Pervading Power,

00:17:34.318 --> 00:17:38.474
then how can there be ignorance?

00:17:44.374 --> 00:17:50.818
But supposing, in the folds of this power,

00:17:50.978 --> 00:17:53.255
if you hide, run away,

00:17:53.415 --> 00:17:57.642
you will say that there is negativity.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.131
Like, you hide yourself in a cave,

00:18:07.291 --> 00:18:12.696
close it properly, and say that there is no sun.

00:18:17.656 --> 00:18:22.085
So those people who cannot become collective,

00:18:22.245 --> 00:18:28.181
are either right-sided or left- sided but more left-sided.

00:18:35.925 --> 00:18:42.767
But left- sided people can be collective in negativity.

00:18:47.519 --> 00:18:51.651
They say, there is a very big fraternity of bhoots.

00:18:54.064 --> 00:19:00.505
Ah, you see some drunkards sitting together.

00:19:03.581 --> 00:19:08.728
They are saying, "See there're so many problem, ecological problem."

00:19:08.888 --> 00:19:11.027
They are drunkards, all drunk,

00:19:11.187 --> 00:19:15.033
and "There are problems of so other kinds.

00:19:15.193 --> 00:19:19.258
When will this end?"

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.202
So the another one says, "Wait, wait, wait.

00:19:31.362 --> 00:19:36.451
I've heard that the whole world is going to collapse very soon."

00:19:46.553 --> 00:19:47.889
Then the third one says,

00:19:48.049 --> 00:19:52.323
"Thank God! We are going to be collapsed, finished."

00:19:54.853 --> 00:20:01.826
Then fourth one says, "But what will happen to our pubs?"

00:20:06.251 --> 00:20:12.436
They say, "It's all right. If we are not existing, what does it matter?"

00:20:15.679 --> 00:20:21.592
That's how the fraternity of the bhoots act.

00:20:23.129 --> 00:20:25.682
They cannot see fun at all,

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:29.035
they cannot enjoy at all,

00:20:32.424 --> 00:20:34.878
and they become very,

00:20:34.982 --> 00:20:37.452
sort of think they are very meditative,

00:20:37.588 --> 00:20:41.418
they are some higher people, they are something superior

00:20:41.404 --> 00:20:44.548
in negativity.

00:20:56.570 --> 00:21:01.669
But, end of these people is that they become lunatics,

00:21:04.472 --> 00:21:10.230
while the end of the right-sided - they become idiotic.

00:21:14.206 --> 00:21:18.160
Once I went to a lunatic asylum,

00:21:20.506 --> 00:21:23.802
and while going there I met a lady,

00:21:23.962 --> 00:21:26.670
and she was quite all right, I mean,

00:21:26.767 --> 00:21:29.195
I thought she was a quite all right woman,

00:21:29.283 --> 00:21:32.579
so I started talking to her.

00:21:40.262 --> 00:21:42.271
And she started talking very wisely:

00:21:42.431 --> 00:21:44.810
"See, my brother- in- law is there, and

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:48.289
I think it isn't necessary that he should be helped,

00:21:48.449 --> 00:21:50.156
and we should not do this, that..."

00:21:50.316 --> 00:21:54.413
All kinds of things she was telling Me,

00:22:02.024 --> 00:22:05.544
showing Me, as if she was very nice and kind

00:22:05.589 --> 00:22:09.161
and no one loves her.

00:22:15.224 --> 00:22:19.155
And she said, "I'm very insecure" and this and that.

00:22:22.799 --> 00:22:26.683
Suddenly the doctor came in

00:22:27.116 --> 00:22:30.694
and she started abusing him, shouting at him.

00:22:30.854 --> 00:22:34.040
I said, "What's this?"

00:22:40.676 --> 00:22:43.478
So the doctor sent for people that,

00:22:43.638 --> 00:22:45.187
"Catch hold of this woman!"

00:22:45.347 --> 00:22:49.521
He told Me, "She's the most violent lunatic

00:22:55.933 --> 00:22:58.664
and why are You talking to her?"

00:22:59.346 --> 00:23:05.188
I did have a headache but I didn't know she was a lunatic.

00:23:09.377 --> 00:23:12.072
Maybe in My presence, her bhoots might have a little bit

00:23:12.232 --> 00:23:14.290
run away and were playing tricks,

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:19.019
but you can see that, clearly.

00:23:24.936 --> 00:23:27.516
So, this emotional attachment is too much,

00:23:27.676 --> 00:23:31.566
and to emotionally, to worry about somebody, that

00:23:31.726 --> 00:23:36.244
"You see, "This is my child, this is my this thing,

00:23:36.404 --> 00:23:38.080
this is this and this is that,"

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.888
and all the time wasting your precious life

00:23:41.048 --> 00:23:46.179
in these things is not the way a Sahaja Yogi should live.

00:23:57.075 --> 00:23:59.425
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot become collective,

00:23:59.585 --> 00:24:03.365
then know that he is not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:24:09.831 --> 00:24:11.522
So, one has to know that

00:24:11.682 --> 00:24:15.869
this is the work of Bhairavnath within us.

00:24:19.233 --> 00:24:22.888
Another work that He gives us light in darkness is that,

00:24:23.048 --> 00:24:30.188
that He, He destroys all the bhoots within us.

00:24:36.352 --> 00:24:39.648
And all kinds of bhootish ideas

00:24:41.173 --> 00:24:45.927
and funny ideas about attachments

00:24:49.369 --> 00:24:52.699
and also the depressiveness.

00:24:54.354 --> 00:24:55.909
So, today we are, I am very happy

00:24:56.069 --> 00:24:59.809
that we are worshipping Shri Bhairava

00:24:59.969 --> 00:25:05.337
because He is very much connected with Ganesha.

00:25:11.225 --> 00:25:14.727
As you know Shri Ganesha is at the Mooladhara

00:25:14.887 --> 00:25:18.996
and while Bhairava moves onto the left side

00:25:19.156 --> 00:25:23.180
and goes to the right side.

00:25:29.684 --> 00:25:34.092
So, all kinds of conditionings, all kinds of habits,

00:25:34.252 --> 00:25:40.945
can be conquered through the help of Bhairavnath.

00:25:48.535 --> 00:25:53.672
In Nepal we have a very huge, big Bhairavnath’s statue

00:25:53.832 --> 00:25:57.733
which is really Swayambhu.

00:26:01.496 --> 00:26:04.011
And people are more left-sided,

00:26:04.171 --> 00:26:07.737
so they are afraid of Bhairavnath.

00:26:11.816 --> 00:26:15.701
So, if somebody has a bad habit, say, of stealing,

00:26:15.861 --> 00:26:18.568
they take him to the, to in front of Bhairavnath

00:26:18.728 --> 00:26:24.113
and put His light there, make a flame.

00:26:33.037 --> 00:26:34.945
I mean, the police takes them.

00:26:35.058 --> 00:26:41.437
And then they ask him, "Now, say before Bhairavnath, confess it."

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:51.826
And they confess what wrong they have done.

00:26:51.986 --> 00:27:01.678
So, He protect us, also from doing wrong things,

00:27:01.785 --> 00:27:05.339
sly things like thieving.

00:27:12.812 --> 00:27:15.874
Whatever we think we can do secretly, can be hidden,

00:27:16.034 --> 00:27:20.267
but you cannot hide it from Bhairavnath.

00:27:26.599 --> 00:27:31.677
If you don't change, then He exposes you completely.

00:27:34.341 --> 00:27:40.225
That's how He has exposed  all the horrible false gurus.

00:27:44.034 --> 00:27:48.146
So, today we are here to worship

00:27:48.306 --> 00:27:50.748
this great Deity of Bhiaravnatha

00:27:50.908 --> 00:27:55.481
who incarnated on this earth later on,

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.948
ultimately as Mahavira also.

00:28:08.082 --> 00:28:12.840
So, He stands on the gate of hell

00:28:15.785 --> 00:28:19.886
and stops people from falling into hell.

00:28:24.409 --> 00:28:26.808
But if you want to go to hell,

00:28:26.968 --> 00:28:30.096
if it is your desire, is your willpower like that working,

00:28:30.256 --> 00:28:31.803
that I should go to hell, then He says,

00:28:31.963 --> 00:28:35.852
'All right, you can go.'

00:28:42.093 --> 00:28:48.563
But as you know, now the hell is also full of people.

00:28:52.382 --> 00:28:58.464
So, it’s better that we should try to fight our negativity

00:28:58.624 --> 00:29:05.528
and become fun-loving, enjoying others, loving others,

00:29:17.977 --> 00:29:21.849
not worrying about what others are doing to you,

00:29:22.009 --> 00:29:27.273
but only thinking what good you can do to others.

00:29:36.303 --> 00:29:43.755
So today's special Puja for Bhairavnath we offer,

00:29:46.788 --> 00:29:53.918
to give us a sense to laugh, to enjoy, to have fun.

00:30:02.476 --> 00:30:06.046
May God bless you all.
