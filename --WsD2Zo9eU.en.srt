1
00:00:46,699 --> 00:00:51,609
I bow to all the seekers of Truth

2
00:01:07,132 --> 00:01:21,117
Yesterday, you have been explained about the
subtle being within us, a subtle instrument

3
00:01:21,137 --> 00:01:33,382
within us, described in the Bible as Tree
of Life, working out this last breakthrough

4
00:01:33,382 --> 00:01:39,232
of Self-realization.

5
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:52,412
And this happening is a living happening,
a spontaneous happening, the way a seed sprouts

6
00:01:52,412 --> 00:02:02,293
spontaneously when it is embedded in the Mother
Earth.

7
00:02:02,293 --> 00:02:17,572
The problem with the human mind is such that
he thinks or it thinks that it can work out

8
00:02:17,572 --> 00:02:30,372
its own realization, its own emancipation.

9
00:02:30,372 --> 00:02:40,503
We do not understand a simple thing that at
the human level, we do not do anything that

10
00:02:40,503 --> 00:02:43,153
is living.

11
00:02:43,153 --> 00:02:52,143
We cannot germinate a seed even on that.

12
00:02:52,143 --> 00:02:58,473
We cannot even create anything that is dead.

13
00:02:58,473 --> 00:03:06,533
We can just transform one dead into another
form.

14
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:19,652
But we cannot understand that whatever we
may try, we cannot lay our hands on the living

15
00:03:19,652 --> 00:03:24,313
process.

16
00:03:24,313 --> 00:03:29,663
Only after Self-realization you are entitled.

17
00:03:29,663 --> 00:03:35,003
You get powers to do living work.

18
00:03:35,003 --> 00:03:46,232
That is the sign of a person who is born again,
who is a yogi, who has had a union with the

19
00:03:46,232 --> 00:03:47,232
Divine.

20
00:03:47,232 --> 00:03:58,792
It is not those who proclaim or announce or
advertise that we are something special selected

21
00:03:58,792 --> 00:04:10,682
people that we have the powers or that we
can take you to Divine.

22
00:04:10,682 --> 00:04:14,852
One can really produce results.

23
00:04:14,852 --> 00:04:27,253
Results can only be produced of living process
when you have the power of your spirit.

24
00:04:27,253 --> 00:04:40,093
We have heard about Christ who cured people
and He cured at that time -- in such a short

25
00:04:40,093 --> 00:04:48,293
time as it was hardly about twenty-one people
â€' and He was crucified.

26
00:04:48,293 --> 00:04:54,213
We could not bear the truth that He was the
Son of God.

27
00:04:54,213 --> 00:05:02,193
Now, maybe one may create big huge organizations
in His name, make big money in His name and

28
00:05:02,193 --> 00:05:09,733
do all kinds of things, but when He was there,
He was present, they denied Him.

29
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:25,443
So as we see within ourself there is this
power which has to manifest, we should be

30
00:05:25,443 --> 00:05:29,863
very anxious to get our Self-realization.

31
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:36,923
If I say there is a diamond available here
-- just free, it's your own â€' people

32
00:05:36,923 --> 00:05:42,753
would come not only from San Diego but also
from Australia, India, Japan and all over

33
00:05:42,753 --> 00:05:46,223
the world asking for it.

34
00:05:46,223 --> 00:05:52,913
But when I say, "There is this diamond within
you in your heart," still we are identifying

35
00:05:52,913 --> 00:06:02,613
with so many falsehoods that we do not want
that diamond to shine in our attention.

36
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:06,473
It is a surprise.

37
00:06:06,473 --> 00:06:15,143
But I am not surprised because we are still
ignorant.

38
00:06:15,143 --> 00:06:23,293
We do not know how beautifully we are made,
how in our evolutionary process we are built

39
00:06:23,293 --> 00:06:29,463
in so beautifully -- the whole information
about the truth.

40
00:06:29,463 --> 00:06:31,713
Only this machinery has to work out.

41
00:06:31,713 --> 00:06:38,543
Only this has to get connected with the Divine.

42
00:06:38,543 --> 00:06:53,603
If we really logically, intelligently understand
that the living process has to work spontaneously

43
00:06:53,603 --> 00:07:03,023
and you can't do anything about it, you can
understand how Sahaja Yoga works.

44
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,403
It's all there.

45
00:07:05,403 --> 00:07:06,943
One does not have to do anything.

46
00:07:06,943 --> 00:07:11,303
It's all there, like a little seed.

47
00:07:11,303 --> 00:07:17,263
A minutest one maybe has all the maps of all
the trees you'll be able to produce.

48
00:07:17,263 --> 00:07:26,433
In the same way, within you lies this potential
which is to be manifested.

49
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:37,173
We have been also told about the left and
right side within us.

50
00:07:37,173 --> 00:07:44,203
Left and right side are the only two sides
to which our attention can go, which represents

51
00:07:44,203 --> 00:07:47,043
our sympathetic nervous system.

52
00:07:47,043 --> 00:07:50,243
That is when you go into any emergency.

53
00:07:50,243 --> 00:07:57,363
Suppose you are rushing somewhere or running,
your sympathetic goes into action and creates

54
00:07:57,363 --> 00:08:03,603
the results necessary for that action.

55
00:08:03,603 --> 00:08:11,293
For example, you have to run; so the sympathetic
will start pumping the blood fast, will start

56
00:08:11,293 --> 00:08:16,273
breathing fast.

57
00:08:16,273 --> 00:08:23,953
But what brings it back to normal is the central
path, what we call represented in the medical

58
00:08:23,953 --> 00:08:28,733
terminology as parasympathetic nervous system.

59
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:34,613
So in our own effort we can only go to the
left or right.

60
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:42,693
But when we try to go too much to the left
or right, we create problems, which we cannot

61
00:08:42,693 --> 00:08:46,833
explain and we cannot understand.

62
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:51,442
The first and foremost problem we create is
the physical problem.

63
00:08:51,442 --> 00:08:53,232
Today there are so many diseases.

64
00:08:53,232 --> 00:09:05,243
We cannot understand how these diseases came
into being and what is the nature of its creation

65
00:09:05,243 --> 00:09:10,703
or how are we going to get rid of this.

66
00:09:10,703 --> 00:09:17,823
Everybody is afraid of that unknown disease
and these unknown diseases can fall up to

67
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:26,793
anyone, whatever you may say, unless and until
you become a spirit.

68
00:09:26,793 --> 00:09:31,823
How they are caused is a very simple thing
to understand.

69
00:09:31,823 --> 00:09:37,483
The physical problems come to us because of
our imbalances.

70
00:09:37,483 --> 00:09:44,043
In various ways we try to go to the left or
to the right.

71
00:09:44,043 --> 00:09:51,343
Now, let us see how cancer is caused because
that is the headache of today, or maybe of

72
00:09:51,343 --> 00:09:57,293
yesterday -- today's headache is something
else.

73
00:09:57,293 --> 00:10:09,023
Cancer is caused only because we do not keep
to our temperament right.

74
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:20,603
If I say that this is the center that is formed
by the left and the right side, then this

75
00:10:20,603 --> 00:10:29,893
center is providing the necessary vital energy
to the left and right side equally.

76
00:10:29,893 --> 00:10:39,403
But supposing you are a very futuristic person,
you are planning too much, thinking too much,

77
00:10:39,403 --> 00:10:40,613
then what do you do?

78
00:10:40,613 --> 00:10:42,953
You use your right side too much.

79
00:10:42,953 --> 00:10:49,033
As a result this moves this way.

80
00:10:49,033 --> 00:10:55,083
Also, the center now constricts.

81
00:10:55,083 --> 00:11:02,763
There is no space in between left in the center
for the vital energy to flow.

82
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:11,593
At this juncture when you have moved too much
from the left side, if any emotional disturbance

83
00:11:11,593 --> 00:11:21,653
comes in or if you go to somebody who is practicing
black magic and all kinds of left-sided negative

84
00:11:21,653 --> 00:11:32,193
things, or else you might get weak with an
accident or a shock, this breaks, and when

85
00:11:32,193 --> 00:11:42,863
this center breaks, you lose your connection
with the center.

86
00:11:42,863 --> 00:11:49,803
The controlling agency that is the central
nervous system does not play any more part.

87
00:11:49,803 --> 00:11:59,843
What happens to you is that the growth of
the cells become malignant -- means they grow

88
00:11:59,843 --> 00:12:02,433
on their own.

89
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:05,365
There is no relationship to the growth of
other cells.

90
00:12:05,365 --> 00:12:13,023
For example, suddenly you'll find such a person
will have a nose increasing in size or you'll

91
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:19,163
find an ear increasing in size overpowering
all others or we can say that it becomes a

92
00:12:19,163 --> 00:12:21,393
very dominating cell.

93
00:12:21,393 --> 00:12:26,503
This is a simple thing that happens in cancer.

94
00:12:26,503 --> 00:12:35,983
Luckily, we have now in Delhi University the
understanding of Sahaja Yoga very well because

95
00:12:35,983 --> 00:12:44,423
we have cured many people of very -- somehow
they were very highly placed in life of cancer

96
00:12:44,423 --> 00:12:45,803
and other diseases.

97
00:12:45,803 --> 00:12:54,823
So they have accepted it for a doctorate,
and two doctors have got now their MD in two

98
00:12:54,823 --> 00:12:57,493
subjects -- one was a psychosomatic disease.

99
00:12:57,493 --> 00:13:02,093
One of the psychosomatic disease is cancer.

100
00:13:02,093 --> 00:13:10,733
There are so many others -- and another one
who has got his doctorate is in the physical

101
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:17,862
fitness and vulnerability.

102
00:13:17,862 --> 00:13:23,003
Now there are seven other doctors in London
who are doing research on it (AIDS?) ....and

103
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:30,523
its remarkable how after realization you get
out of the clutches of physical sickness.

104
00:13:30,523 --> 00:13:40,753
So what happens when the kundalini rises,
what she does, she pierces through this constricted

105
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:48,773
chakras, repairs it and brings it back to
its normal position, repairs it.

106
00:13:48,773 --> 00:13:57,793
And I have seen our President of India getting
cured of his cancer in ten minutes time, that

107
00:13:57,793 --> 00:14:02,773
too on the aeroplane.

108
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:11,853
But it's easy to deal with an Indian because
they know what is a kundalini and they know

109
00:14:11,853 --> 00:14:13,113
what is a saint.

110
00:14:13,113 --> 00:14:19,423
They will not easily take to these fake persons.

111
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:32,643
Though you are great seekers of a very high
quality, that understanding is there in India

112
00:14:32,643 --> 00:14:36,763
more because they know more about the roots
and not about the tree, as you know more about

113
00:14:36,763 --> 00:14:39,373
the tree.

114
00:14:39,373 --> 00:14:49,163
But it's such a barrier in understanding that
three hundred years English ruled in India,

115
00:14:49,163 --> 00:14:51,693
they could not learn a word.

116
00:14:51,693 --> 00:15:02,103
Today, it's amazing to see such a difficult
Sanskrit verses about the Primordial Mother

117
00:15:02,103 --> 00:15:11,723
written by Adi Shankaracharya in the sixth
century, which many Indians will find it difficult

118
00:15:11,723 --> 00:15:17,653
to sing, it's so beautifully sung.

119
00:15:17,653 --> 00:15:25,973
The whole mantras, as they say, are beautifully
rendered that even a well-equipped Brahmin

120
00:15:25,973 --> 00:15:30,463
cannot do, by people who are not from India.

121
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:34,763
They don't even know Sanskrit language.

122
00:15:34,763 --> 00:15:41,083
How this has happened is the manifestation
of the spirit.

123
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:48,083
The manifestation of the spirit gives you
a dynamic personality.

124
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:52,093
This dynamism comes to you.

125
00:15:52,093 --> 00:15:57,413
You can sing whatever you like, you can draw
whatever you like, you can paint whatever

126
00:15:57,413 --> 00:15:58,893
you like.

127
00:15:58,893 --> 00:16:06,163
There are so many people who have become great
orators and musicians, especially in India,

128
00:16:06,163 --> 00:16:09,773
because my work mostly has been in India.

129
00:16:09,773 --> 00:16:16,373
Of course, not that I am not concerned about
the West.

130
00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:21,672
I have been, as I told you, many a times in
America.

131
00:16:21,672 --> 00:16:32,563
But to understand the reality, the first thing
we must know that money has nothing to do

132
00:16:32,563 --> 00:16:34,093
with the living process.

133
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:46,063
In America, you'll be surprised, there has
been a business offered to me that the cool

134
00:16:46,063 --> 00:16:57,043
breeze that I blow, if I can bottle it up,
they can sell it.

135
00:16:57,043 --> 00:17:05,613
Everything goes into a business proposition,
and that's why it is so difficult.

136
00:17:05,613 --> 00:17:15,473
For example, you have seen near -- of course,
I must say you are great people that you have

137
00:17:15,473 --> 00:17:25,143
come to a program which has nothing to do
with money -- it is something really remarkable,

138
00:17:25,143 --> 00:17:28,263
I must say.

139
00:17:28,263 --> 00:17:35,023
But today if I was talking in India or if
I was visiting even a small village, there

140
00:17:35,023 --> 00:17:45,123
would have been minimum ten thousand people
-- minimum â€' and they would get all their

141
00:17:45,123 --> 00:17:47,773
realization.

142
00:17:47,773 --> 00:18:00,113
The seeking is in the West, they are honest
seekers, but what to seek is the knowledge

143
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:01,983
which is in the East.

144
00:18:01,983 --> 00:18:09,223
It's something like somebody have the teeth
but no food, and those have food have no teeth

145
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:18,013
on one side and on the other side they have
teeth but no food.

146
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:27,192
It is such a simple thing to get rid of your
physical problems â€' is the easiest â€'

147
00:18:27,192 --> 00:18:36,272
and the second comes is the problem, as they
say, is of stress, which is a common disease

148
00:18:36,272 --> 00:18:38,902
in the West, is stress.

149
00:18:38,902 --> 00:18:44,302
What is the source of stress within us?

150
00:18:44,302 --> 00:18:51,942
The source of stress is very simple that when
we think -- I mean, these days the amount

151
00:18:51,942 --> 00:19:03,343
of thinking we do -- first of all when I came
to America, I was very confused because of

152
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:06,802
the choices you had.

153
00:19:06,802 --> 00:19:13,182
You walk into any bathroom -- you better ask
the owner how do you operate, otherwise suddenly

154
00:19:13,182 --> 00:19:19,642
you'll find you have fallen into a big swimming
pool; suddenly it opens out for you.

155
00:19:19,642 --> 00:19:31,662
Or maybe you open some sort of a shower and
it becomes a torrential rain -- so many choices

156
00:19:31,662 --> 00:19:35,452
which maddens you completely.

157
00:19:35,452 --> 00:19:40,613
What is there to choose about how you'll have
your scissors?

158
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:46,202
As long as the scissor work, it should be
all right.

159
00:19:46,202 --> 00:19:51,733
It is so complicated because so much of machinery
-- they have to produce so many things, so

160
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,932
many varieties!

161
00:19:54,932 --> 00:20:02,272
Right from A to Z, whether it is a dress,
whether it is a hair-do, whether it is a carpet,

162
00:20:02,272 --> 00:20:10,542
or it is an ordinary thing which we call as
the handle of the car.

163
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:16,012
Before getting into the car better ask the
driver how it operates otherwise you'll be

164
00:20:16,012 --> 00:20:17,312
lumped?[locked].

165
00:20:17,312 --> 00:20:26,402
There is no uniformity kept about these useless
material things and so the choices are so

166
00:20:26,402 --> 00:20:27,402
many.

167
00:20:27,402 --> 00:20:32,483
You go to a shop, you go mad -- you don't
know what to buy.

168
00:20:32,483 --> 00:20:39,923
You just ask them, "I just need a, some, say,
powder for my body."

169
00:20:39,923 --> 00:20:42,103
"Now, which one you want?

170
00:20:42,103 --> 00:20:43,103
This one?

171
00:20:43,103 --> 00:20:44,103
This one?"

172
00:20:44,103 --> 00:20:45,273
They'll give you thirty-two things.

173
00:20:45,273 --> 00:20:46,912
You start wondering, "Oh, God!

174
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:50,332
I have only one body and thirty-two things."

175
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:59,243
It is so difficult to locate something that
you need because you really don't know -- this

176
00:20:59,243 --> 00:21:03,843
is natural, number one; this is absurd, number
two -- like that goes on and on and on, the

177
00:21:03,843 --> 00:21:08,473
list for a small nonsensical thing like that.

178
00:21:08,473 --> 00:21:12,223
Then tomorrow you go in the market, you find
that's gone out of market.

179
00:21:12,223 --> 00:21:17,613
Now another thirty-two things have come!

180
00:21:17,613 --> 00:21:27,582
All such maddening things put you to thinking,
"What should I do?"

181
00:21:27,582 --> 00:21:32,873
Then we have to plan out everything in the
future.

182
00:21:32,873 --> 00:21:40,442
It is so much so that by temperament, people
have become futuristic.

183
00:21:40,442 --> 00:21:46,142
Like they are sitting here listening to Me,
but they are thinking, "Now, how will I go

184
00:21:46,142 --> 00:21:47,142
home?

185
00:21:47,142 --> 00:21:49,572
And what food I will be eating?

186
00:21:49,572 --> 00:21:51,822
Then what music I will have?"

187
00:21:51,822 --> 00:22:00,632
They are sitting here at present but thinking
about something ....They are too much planning.

188
00:22:00,632 --> 00:22:03,272
They do not know the plan of the Divine.

189
00:22:03,272 --> 00:22:08,863
They'll plan it out: rush, go forward, do
this, go to the airport.

190
00:22:08,863 --> 00:22:09,873
What has happened?

191
00:22:09,873 --> 00:22:13,883
The plane is delayed three hours!

192
00:22:13,883 --> 00:22:14,883
Why?

193
00:22:14,883 --> 00:22:18,623
Because their condition, holiday cancelled.

194
00:22:18,623 --> 00:22:22,452
They had planned the holiday a year ahead.

195
00:22:22,452 --> 00:22:28,182
Poor things, you see, packed everything to
go somewhere.

196
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:32,493
Holiday had to be cancelled because the planes
are not moving.

197
00:22:32,493 --> 00:22:34,932
So they sit down on the airport.

198
00:22:34,932 --> 00:22:37,912
See, they're waiting for something to happen.

199
00:22:37,912 --> 00:22:43,892
Nothing happens; they go off.

200
00:22:43,892 --> 00:22:49,623
But a yogi does not plan.

201
00:22:49,623 --> 00:22:53,572
He knows what's going to happen.

202
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,802
He does not bother.

203
00:22:55,802 --> 00:23:01,403
But supposing a yogi gets lost on the way.

204
00:23:01,403 --> 00:23:07,662
Then he thinks, "All right, if I am lost there
must be something here.

205
00:23:07,662 --> 00:23:09,282
I must see it.

206
00:23:09,282 --> 00:23:10,503
I am there with myself.

207
00:23:10,503 --> 00:23:11,932
I am not lost.

208
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,412
So let's enjoy."

209
00:23:14,412 --> 00:23:18,143
After all, what are we going to miss?

210
00:23:18,143 --> 00:23:25,312
It is something one has to see that as we
are so much stressed and under the domination

211
00:23:25,312 --> 00:23:35,422
of these watches, that we all the time rush,
rush, rush.

212
00:23:35,422 --> 00:23:40,993
Even the jobs that we do, we are supposed
to rush.

213
00:23:40,993 --> 00:23:50,432
You will rush as much as you like but the
problem is your mind also rushes with it and

214
00:23:50,432 --> 00:23:53,353
the whole personality gets involved into it.

215
00:23:53,353 --> 00:24:02,262
But if you have seen a wheel, the whole wheel
moves but the axis has to be steady.

216
00:24:02,262 --> 00:24:07,493
If the axis also starts moving, there is stress.

217
00:24:07,493 --> 00:24:17,632
That's exactly what happens to us that we
start moving with all the tensions that are

218
00:24:17,632 --> 00:24:21,093
so-called -- I call them [unclear].

219
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:25,012
There is a center within us which we call
as Swadhisthana center.

220
00:24:25,012 --> 00:24:32,463
It's the second center which as you see is
working out the Void.

221
00:24:32,463 --> 00:24:40,643
We call this as the Void -- not the Zen Void
-- but this is the Void, and this area is

222
00:24:40,643 --> 00:24:50,202
worked out by the Swadhisthana which looks
after the liver, the pancreas, spleen, the

223
00:24:50,202 --> 00:24:53,843
kidneys and part of the intestine.

224
00:24:53,843 --> 00:25:01,072
Intestines, physically or in the medical terminology
we can say, the aortic plexus manifested by

225
00:25:01,072 --> 00:25:06,493
this center works out.

226
00:25:06,493 --> 00:25:12,952
Now when the center is doing this work in
balance, it's all right.

227
00:25:12,952 --> 00:25:23,782
But when we think too much then the same center
has to convert the fat for the use of the

228
00:25:23,782 --> 00:25:29,532
brain to make it into gray cells.

229
00:25:29,532 --> 00:25:39,473
But when we think too much then it neglects
other important works which it has to do.

230
00:25:39,473 --> 00:25:42,162
So you get a liver trouble.

231
00:25:42,162 --> 00:25:51,292
I find at least fifty percent people in the
West are suffering from liver trouble.

232
00:25:51,292 --> 00:25:57,822
They are not aware of it till they get to
cirrhosis, to skin troubles, this, that.

233
00:25:57,822 --> 00:26:06,802
They will not know that they have a bad liver,
till they have jaundice or other diseases

234
00:26:06,802 --> 00:26:13,692
which are caused by liver problems.

235
00:26:13,692 --> 00:26:18,412
Then we have people who have lethargic livers
also.

236
00:26:18,412 --> 00:26:24,593
So we have two types of people who have lethargic
organs or overactive organs.

237
00:26:24,593 --> 00:26:35,952
So this Swadhisthana Chakra cannot look after
its duty in a balanced way, creates a kind

238
00:26:35,952 --> 00:26:39,172
of an imbalance.

239
00:26:39,172 --> 00:26:46,373
So you neglect your pancreas, you get diabetes.

240
00:26:46,373 --> 00:26:54,012
It's a funny idea that is now prevalent that
we should not take sugar because â€' I

241
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:59,502
don't know from where it has come -- because
they think it causes you diabetes!

242
00:26:59,502 --> 00:27:02,743
It does not.

243
00:27:02,743 --> 00:27:14,843
In India, in a village if you go, they have
to put so much sugar in the tea that the spoon

244
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:21,873
must stand at right angles â€' otherwise
they won't take â€' and nobody has diabetes.

245
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:24,273
They have never heard about it, never.

246
00:27:24,273 --> 00:27:25,273
No.

247
00:27:25,273 --> 00:27:26,912
"What is diabetes?

248
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:28,782
What is that?"

249
00:27:28,782 --> 00:27:30,552
they'll say.

250
00:27:30,552 --> 00:27:37,272
The reason is they don't think.

251
00:27:37,272 --> 00:27:38,272
They live for the moment.

252
00:27:38,272 --> 00:27:41,022
All right, today is the work.

253
00:27:41,022 --> 00:27:48,123
Let's do this farming and come home and sleep
off.

254
00:27:48,123 --> 00:27:50,483
They don't think too much.

255
00:27:50,483 --> 00:27:53,983
We think about everything, plan out everything.

256
00:27:53,983 --> 00:28:01,853
Whatever is spontaneous also we think about
it!

257
00:28:01,853 --> 00:28:06,792
Then the third thing that happens to you is
the trouble of the spleen.

258
00:28:06,792 --> 00:28:08,642
Now spleen is our time-keeper.

259
00:28:08,642 --> 00:28:11,812
It gives us a rhythm.

260
00:28:11,812 --> 00:28:17,093
As you have seen the rhythm today, in the
same way it's the rhythm of the life is kept

261
00:28:17,093 --> 00:28:19,493
by the spleen.

262
00:28:19,493 --> 00:28:26,872
When you go into an emergency, then the same
spleen starts producing more red blood corpuscles

263
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,643
for your use.

264
00:28:28,643 --> 00:28:35,812
Now today's life, as it is, is all the time
shocking.

265
00:28:35,812 --> 00:28:41,632
Early in the morning you read your newspaper.

266
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:48,503
I think this is one of the worst habits, because
as soon as you see the newspaper, the first

267
00:28:48,503 --> 00:28:49,812
shock in the morning.

268
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:51,012
Oh, God!

269
00:28:51,012 --> 00:28:52,372
So many dead.

270
00:28:52,372 --> 00:28:54,983
Plane was crashed.

271
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,633
War has started.

272
00:28:57,633 --> 00:28:59,932
Somebody fell from somewhere.

273
00:28:59,932 --> 00:29:05,483
All horrible things in the newspaper because
newspapers don't believe in giving something

274
00:29:05,483 --> 00:29:07,452
good news!

275
00:29:07,452 --> 00:29:14,702
If there will be peace and happiness what
will they publish, I don't know.

276
00:29:14,702 --> 00:29:19,733
So they want to give shocking news so there
is some sensation in the body.

277
00:29:19,733 --> 00:29:26,122
It has happened to such an extent that now
unless and until the music is sensational,

278
00:29:26,122 --> 00:29:32,682
unless and until we get a shock all the time,
we do not react.

279
00:29:32,682 --> 00:29:37,022
Of course, the joy part is missing -- no doubt
about it.

280
00:29:37,022 --> 00:29:45,353
So this poor spleen doesn't understand -- this
personality which is all the time under shock.

281
00:29:45,353 --> 00:29:51,392
Then you get into our car and on the road
there is a jam.

282
00:29:51,392 --> 00:29:52,392
Finish!

283
00:29:52,392 --> 00:29:56,772
You had to reach at such and such time; now
it's a jam.

284
00:29:56,772 --> 00:30:03,682
Now you are cursing everything, sitting down
there worrying.

285
00:30:03,682 --> 00:30:05,552
Suddenly you find an accident.

286
00:30:05,552 --> 00:30:09,713
Then you go in the office or some place where
you are working.

287
00:30:09,713 --> 00:30:15,082
The boss has had a quarrel with his wife;
so he comes and shouts at you -- another shock.

288
00:30:15,082 --> 00:30:21,503
All the time you are facing very arrogant,
horrible people.

289
00:30:21,503 --> 00:30:27,272
I mean, I myself am afraid to go to shops
or anything because suddenly they jump on

290
00:30:27,272 --> 00:30:32,993
you like a horse or sometimes like a dog.

291
00:30:32,993 --> 00:30:35,622
God knows how they will react on you.

292
00:30:35,622 --> 00:30:37,442
You get a fright.

293
00:30:37,442 --> 00:30:38,993
What's the matter with them?

294
00:30:38,993 --> 00:30:41,363
Why are they so shocking?

295
00:30:41,363 --> 00:30:47,402
But all of them are under stress and they
are taking it out on you.

296
00:30:47,402 --> 00:30:57,863
But the worst thing that happens with this
spleen going crazy is that you get blood cancer.

297
00:30:57,863 --> 00:31:09,392
Blood cancer is caused by hectic life and
for speedy life that we lead.

298
00:31:09,392 --> 00:31:13,282
Now the blood pressure comes from the kidney.

299
00:31:13,282 --> 00:31:18,613
And like that so many things are caused by
one simple thing â€' that we think too

300
00:31:18,613 --> 00:31:21,163
much.

301
00:31:21,163 --> 00:31:23,973
What is there to think?

302
00:31:23,973 --> 00:31:26,843
I just don't understand.

303
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:29,622
Whatever has to happen, will happen.

304
00:31:29,622 --> 00:31:33,113
By thinking, nothing is going to stop.

305
00:31:33,113 --> 00:31:37,213
By thinking we have achieved nothing.

306
00:31:37,213 --> 00:31:44,072
If you read Einstein who has developed the
theory of relativity, at the very outset he

307
00:31:44,072 --> 00:31:52,952
says that, "I was tired and I was lying down
in my garden, playing with soap bubbles and

308
00:31:52,952 --> 00:32:01,103
suddenly from somewhere unknown the theory
of relativity dawned upon me."

309
00:32:01,103 --> 00:32:04,263
Whatever we have is there.

310
00:32:04,263 --> 00:32:12,492
Whatever we have to find out comes from the
unknown, but thinking about it like mad just

311
00:32:12,492 --> 00:32:13,492
ruins us.

312
00:32:13,492 --> 00:32:16,013
But if I say, "Don't think," you can't stop
thinking.

313
00:32:16,013 --> 00:32:21,182
I know that because we had a wonderful doctor
in Switzerland.

314
00:32:21,182 --> 00:32:23,603
He came and said, "Mother, do what You like.

315
00:32:23,603 --> 00:32:28,072
You cut my throat, You cut my head but stop
this thinking.

316
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:29,632
I am going mad."

317
00:32:29,632 --> 00:32:35,593
So he developed a momentum of thinking, all
the time thinking, thinking, thinking.

318
00:32:35,593 --> 00:32:41,093
Now what happens with the kundalini, when
the kundalini rises, passes through your Agnya

319
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:48,062
Chakra, you go beyond thinking.

320
00:32:48,062 --> 00:32:53,182
It is like one wave of thought comes up and
goes down, another wave of thought comes up

321
00:32:53,182 --> 00:32:55,513
and goes down.

322
00:32:55,513 --> 00:33:00,353
In the center there is a little space; so
one comes from the past and goes to the future,

323
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,912
another from the future to the past.

324
00:33:02,912 --> 00:33:06,713
In between there is a little space, and that
is the present.

325
00:33:06,713 --> 00:33:12,742
So when the kundalini rises, passes through
this Agnya Chakra â€' the one that gives

326
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:19,412
you thought is the ego and the superego on
both the side, as you can see clearly -- they

327
00:33:19,412 --> 00:33:27,812
are sucked in; your karmas are sucked in,
your ego is sucked in, your conditioning is

328
00:33:27,812 --> 00:33:33,513
sucked in and you stand at the present moment.

329
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:38,282
Then if you want to think, if you don't want
to think, you just sit down in complete silence

330
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:40,942
and enjoy yourself.

331
00:33:40,942 --> 00:33:43,072
You become in command.

332
00:33:43,072 --> 00:33:48,603
Like you are standing in the water, you are
afraid of getting drowned, but if you get

333
00:33:48,603 --> 00:33:51,663
into the boat you enjoy the water.

334
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:57,952
But supposing you become a master swimmer,
then you can save others also from the water.

335
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:05,642
This is exactly what happens when a Sahaja
yogi establishes himself well, that he can

336
00:34:05,642 --> 00:34:13,752
give salvation to so many and can save so
many people.

337
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:16,983
This is how we are going to emancipate.

338
00:34:16,983 --> 00:34:23,603
Now the emotional side that we have is also
another extreme to which we bow?

339
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:30,533
And with the help of certain elements, you
will be surprised: one candle can at least

340
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:38,973
cure twenty-five mad people at least.

341
00:34:38,973 --> 00:34:40,942
It's very simple.

342
00:34:40,942 --> 00:34:52,402
If you enlighten this light, then what happens
that enlightened light goes inside your left

343
00:34:52,402 --> 00:35:02,132
side and enlightens it completely and all
the negativity disappears in your collective

344
00:35:02,132 --> 00:35:03,733
subconscious.

345
00:35:03,733 --> 00:35:11,672
And you know who all suffer from the left
side of insanity, epilepsy, schizophrenia,

346
00:35:11,672 --> 00:35:16,223
all this nonsense.

347
00:35:16,223 --> 00:35:22,903
Because you stand in the center -- you are
neither on the left nor on the right -- if

348
00:35:22,903 --> 00:35:26,882
you are in the center, you get rid of your
emotional problems.

349
00:35:26,882 --> 00:35:31,263
Now, there are spiritual problems also.

350
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:39,403
Before as we have, I told you, thinking problem,
we have also physical problems like over-exertion.

351
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:41,983
Now people are jogging.

352
00:35:41,983 --> 00:35:46,302
It's madness, I really tell you.

353
00:35:46,302 --> 00:35:50,862
First, I thought there is some sort of an
earthquake that the old, young, everybody

354
00:35:50,862 --> 00:35:51,862
running.

355
00:35:51,862 --> 00:35:52,862
What is happening?

356
00:35:52,862 --> 00:35:53,862
What's wrong?

357
00:35:53,862 --> 00:35:56,353
Where are you running?

358
00:35:56,353 --> 00:35:59,973
Because you are over-exerting yourself.

359
00:35:59,973 --> 00:36:03,733
What is the need to over-exert yourself?

360
00:36:03,733 --> 00:36:09,254
Because now a concept is that if you are muscular
-- I don't know whatever is the concept, every

361
00:36:09,254 --> 00:36:14,923
day changing, every day you find new, new
things -- then you become over-efficient;

362
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:15,923
you become tired.

363
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:16,923
It's absurd.

364
00:36:16,923 --> 00:36:23,943
We have seen in history, say, we have got
the greatest statesman and the person who

365
00:36:23,943 --> 00:36:30,923
saved us from this horrible Hitler was Churchill
and what a fat man he was.

366
00:36:30,923 --> 00:36:43,443
He never did jogging in his life!

367
00:36:43,443 --> 00:36:45,793
I mean, you must accept your body.

368
00:36:45,793 --> 00:36:46,793
It requires rest.

369
00:36:46,793 --> 00:36:53,153
For example, if I start jogging, I'll be nowhere
Myself because I need a lot of water to protect

370
00:36:53,153 --> 00:36:56,183
the chakras which work out the emancipation.

371
00:36:56,183 --> 00:37:05,113
To Me, that is much more important than becoming
some sort of a cinema actress.

372
00:37:05,113 --> 00:37:06,443
There are many cinema actresses.

373
00:37:06,443 --> 00:37:07,613
So what?

374
00:37:07,613 --> 00:37:09,163
What have they achieved?

375
00:37:09,163 --> 00:37:14,493
How many people have they emancipated?

376
00:37:14,493 --> 00:37:18,862
So what is your ideal in life is to be decided
first.

377
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:23,793
Do you want to be all the time slave of your
body?

378
00:37:23,793 --> 00:37:25,783
And I don't know what you get.

379
00:37:25,783 --> 00:37:28,663
I mean, these days nobody looks at no one.

380
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:36,552
They are fed up now and you can't make out
one from another because they go to the same

381
00:37:36,552 --> 00:37:38,003
hairdresser.

382
00:37:38,003 --> 00:37:39,623
One fashion starts.

383
00:37:39,623 --> 00:37:44,783
I have to think, "Is this he same person or
somebody else?"

384
00:37:44,783 --> 00:37:53,793
I mean, it is better to grow your beard to
look something different.

385
00:37:53,793 --> 00:37:58,082
I mean, there no way of making out who is
who!

386
00:37:58,082 --> 00:38:03,693
Everybody has the same hair dress, everybody
has the same funny dress, everybody looking

387
00:38:03,693 --> 00:38:04,693
the same.

388
00:38:04,693 --> 00:38:07,583
They have no personality.

389
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:12,862
Tomorrow a wave comes that you should put
a plastic bag on your head -- everybody will

390
00:38:12,862 --> 00:38:17,753
be moving with a plastic head.

391
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,593
We have to have a personality.

392
00:38:19,593 --> 00:38:24,403
Why should we dress up as everybody is dressing
up?

393
00:38:24,403 --> 00:38:26,973
Such a pressure.

394
00:38:26,973 --> 00:38:32,053
I know that because I have another life which
you know very well which is supposed to be

395
00:38:32,053 --> 00:38:36,443
the high society -- so-called.

396
00:38:36,443 --> 00:38:41,903
And the stupidest thing we discuss in that
society.

397
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:48,803
Like they laugh at a woman if she is wearing
something that was, say, belonging to sixties.

398
00:38:48,803 --> 00:38:53,003
I mean, what's the harm?

399
00:38:53,003 --> 00:38:55,892
No, that's not modern!

400
00:38:55,892 --> 00:38:59,943
But what do you gain by becoming so modern
running with the fashion?

401
00:38:59,943 --> 00:39:01,713
What do you gain?

402
00:39:01,713 --> 00:39:07,332
Now the fashion in England is to make holey
pants -- you make holes.

403
00:39:07,332 --> 00:39:11,132
Imagine that cold, horrible cold that you
have.

404
00:39:11,132 --> 00:39:17,793
What is the need to make holes in your pant
to get all kinds of troubles?

405
00:39:17,793 --> 00:39:20,163
And then they'll have arthritis; then they'll
have this.

406
00:39:20,163 --> 00:39:24,263
First they had tight pants; so they developed
varicose veins.

407
00:39:24,263 --> 00:39:33,013
Now they are having such loose pants that
they will develop arthritis.

408
00:39:33,013 --> 00:39:36,283
These people are managing you.

409
00:39:36,283 --> 00:39:40,203
These manufacturers are befooling you.

410
00:39:40,203 --> 00:39:46,963
This we cannot see because we have lost our
personality.

411
00:39:46,963 --> 00:39:53,433
So we develop so many problems also because
we play into the hands of nonsenses.

412
00:39:53,433 --> 00:40:00,852
Now, say, Indian people have lived for so
many ages now so they have learnt all the

413
00:40:00,852 --> 00:40:02,062
lessons.

414
00:40:02,062 --> 00:40:08,223
If you go and tell them that you wear a holey
pant they'll say to/you, "Get lost!

415
00:40:08,223 --> 00:40:09,363
Sorry, sir.

416
00:40:09,363 --> 00:40:10,553
We know everything."

417
00:40:10,553 --> 00:40:18,112
Now they are painting their hair and when
they are painting their hair, people say,

418
00:40:18,112 --> 00:40:20,562
"Why are you painting their hair?"

419
00:40:20,562 --> 00:40:23,243
"Oh, that's the fashion.

420
00:40:23,243 --> 00:40:24,433
What's wrong?"

421
00:40:24,433 --> 00:40:27,203
But people become blind in that.

422
00:40:27,203 --> 00:40:33,153
We had three patients who became blind because
they painted their hair and some sort of a

423
00:40:33,153 --> 00:40:34,653
thing -- punk, punk.

424
00:40:34,653 --> 00:40:39,663
They were three blind punks who came to Sahaja
Yoga.

425
00:40:39,663 --> 00:40:47,543
Actually, you have to punch them to talk to
them.

426
00:40:47,543 --> 00:40:51,463
This is the society in which we live.

427
00:40:51,463 --> 00:40:55,043
Anybody who is sane will think I am mad.

428
00:40:55,043 --> 00:41:03,173
Like going to a lunatic asylum, you start
thinking, "Am I mad or they are mad?"

429
00:41:03,173 --> 00:41:05,423
That's how it creates a stress on us.

430
00:41:05,423 --> 00:41:11,102
Let us live with our own dignity.

431
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:14,892
You can see Mahatma Gandhi went for his round
table conference.

432
00:41:14,892 --> 00:41:18,082
He wore his dhoti.

433
00:41:18,082 --> 00:41:25,243
He didn't wear a three-piece suit and a tail
coat -- that's another nonsense!

434
00:41:25,243 --> 00:41:29,773
Everybody in England has to wear a tailcoat
when they go to the Queen's party.

435
00:41:29,773 --> 00:41:31,892
But they can't afford.

436
00:41:31,892 --> 00:41:37,263
So they borrow; some are tight, some are loose.

437
00:41:37,263 --> 00:41:42,993
And when you see them there -- I mean, I have
been to many of them -- you can't recognize,

438
00:41:42,993 --> 00:41:52,112
and they look so absurd and clownish that,
poor things, you know all these big, big ambassadors

439
00:41:52,112 --> 00:41:56,453
have to go about with that because it is supposed
to be a formal dress.

440
00:41:56,453 --> 00:41:59,913
I mean, what a formal dress it is.

441
00:41:59,913 --> 00:42:02,622
All these things pressurize you.

442
00:42:02,622 --> 00:42:07,593
They make you feel, "Oh, you must wear a dress
like this."

443
00:42:07,593 --> 00:42:14,693
Even when you go to some guru, he says, "All
right, you all have to wear," say, "orange

444
00:42:14,693 --> 00:42:15,733
dress."

445
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:21,543
So you are forced into it; you have to wear
the orange dress.

446
00:42:21,543 --> 00:42:31,513
From where are you going to manage -- getting
rid of all this nonsense of forcing you to

447
00:42:31,513 --> 00:42:34,042
do this and forcing you to do that.

448
00:42:34,042 --> 00:42:43,142
But here you are so individualistic and here
you are a down-to-earth personality,

449
00:42:43,142 --> 00:42:50,903
Its not that anybody says you have to do it
but you just do it because we have our own

450
00:42:50,903 --> 00:42:51,903
personality.

451
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:55,563
Individualism means personality.

452
00:42:55,563 --> 00:43:05,003
And that is what when it is lost, you feel
also your guilt and your stress.

453
00:43:05,003 --> 00:43:13,092
That's possible that you stand on in your
own glory, in your own personality, in your

454
00:43:13,092 --> 00:43:16,693
own understanding of your spiritual value.

455
00:43:16,693 --> 00:43:25,213
So when that starts, another style of movement
comes in, like hippies.

456
00:43:25,213 --> 00:43:39,302
We become like a primitive person, you become
like a hippy, you go about like a hippy, you

457
00:43:39,302 --> 00:43:48,023
wear a funny dress, become a primitive personality
and think, "Oh, I have done very great thing."

458
00:43:48,023 --> 00:43:54,093
I had some hippies with Me, I told you yesterday.

459
00:43:54,093 --> 00:43:59,683
So I asked them, "Why do you dress up like
this?"

460
00:43:59,683 --> 00:44:02,953
They said, "We want this kind of culture."

461
00:44:02,953 --> 00:44:04,853
I said, "This is primitive."

462
00:44:04,853 --> 00:44:05,853
They said, "We want to be primitive."

463
00:44:05,853 --> 00:44:08,053
I said, "You cannot be.

464
00:44:08,053 --> 00:44:09,793
Your brain is modern.

465
00:44:09,793 --> 00:44:14,943
Just by wearing these primitive things you
cannot be.

466
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:18,753
Accept it, accept yourself.

467
00:44:18,753 --> 00:44:38,683
And now you have your realization and it will
work out."

468
00:44:38,683 --> 00:44:48,154
So with all these stresses on us -- thinking
too much, futuristic personality â€' you

469
00:44:48,154 --> 00:44:49,802
develop the stress.

470
00:44:49,802 --> 00:45:01,233
Now what happens when kundalini rises, you
are beyond thought.

471
00:45:01,233 --> 00:45:04,053
That's called in Sanskrit as Nirvichar Samadhi
-- thoughtless awareness.

472
00:45:04,053 --> 00:45:12,953
You are fully aware -- on the contrary, you
are more aware â€' but you are in thoughtless

473
00:45:12,953 --> 00:45:13,953
awareness.

474
00:45:13,953 --> 00:45:19,062
Now when I see this carpet in thoughtless
awareness, I don't think.

475
00:45:19,062 --> 00:45:24,112
I don't think because if I have to think,
"Oh, Baba, this is my carpet.

476
00:45:24,112 --> 00:45:25,713
Now I have not insured it.

477
00:45:25,713 --> 00:45:28,673
If somebody will run away with it, then what
will happen?"

478
00:45:28,673 --> 00:45:30,283
I won't be able to give any speech or anything.

479
00:45:30,283 --> 00:45:36,233
I'll be worried about the carpet only.

480
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:39,223
But when I look at this carpet, I don't think.

481
00:45:39,223 --> 00:45:48,903
Only the joy of the creation of this carpet
is just pouring into Me; a beautiful blissful

482
00:45:48,903 --> 00:45:50,533
feeling, that's all.

483
00:45:50,533 --> 00:45:52,973
I am not thinking.

484
00:45:52,973 --> 00:46:04,102
Like a very still beautiful lake which has
no ripples reflects all the beauty that is

485
00:46:04,102 --> 00:46:05,953
around it, fully.

486
00:46:05,953 --> 00:46:18,443
A complete joy is reflected in a mind which
is absolutely still, not reacting, not accepting,

487
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:22,243
just seeing, witnessing.

488
00:46:22,243 --> 00:46:31,463
And this witness state comes into you and
you become a tranquil and a peaceful personality.

489
00:46:31,463 --> 00:46:39,112
Such peace that such a person, wherever he
goes, wherever he walks, a peaceful atmosphere

490
00:46:39,112 --> 00:46:41,852
prevails.

491
00:46:41,852 --> 00:46:47,723
The nature, the elements all react to such
a personality.

492
00:46:47,723 --> 00:46:55,903
Just talking about peace or giving prizes
of peace, you do not feel peace.

493
00:46:55,903 --> 00:47:01,283
I know of people who have got Nobel Prizes
of peace are horrid.

494
00:47:01,283 --> 00:47:07,102
They look like some mad dogs.

495
00:47:07,102 --> 00:47:11,403
If you have to talk to them, take the barge
pole in between.

496
00:47:11,403 --> 00:47:17,573
Don't know when you'll be hit with the prize
they have got.

497
00:47:17,573 --> 00:47:23,592
And you may have to pay very dearly for meting
such a personality who is supposed to be the

498
00:47:23,592 --> 00:47:32,503
foundation of peace and you find it's a fountain
of violence.

499
00:47:32,503 --> 00:47:42,632
This is the situation today that we are placed
in a society which artificially expresses

500
00:47:42,632 --> 00:50:11,403
itself.

501
00:50:11,403 --> 00:50:33,003
There

502
00:50:33,003 --> 01:23:53,162
is nothing genuine, nothing innate ...
