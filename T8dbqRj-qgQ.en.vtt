00:00:29.651 --> 00:00:35.390
Today, we are going to do Puja for Navaratri.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.100
Yesterday you saw a beautiful description

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.174
of Navaratri, and how

00:00:54.523 --> 00:01:02.431
the Mother Goddess has created all kinds of powers within you.

00:01:04.302 --> 00:01:07.918
It's not that only She has the powers,

00:01:08.324 --> 00:01:11.008
but you all have the powers

00:01:11.813 --> 00:01:14.216
and you can all work it out.

00:01:15.023 --> 00:01:20.958
You can all find out whether these powers are there or not.

00:01:24.198 --> 00:01:30.794
With us the Realization is very important,

00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:38.386
but there the Kundalini has given you this Realization.

00:01:40.825 --> 00:01:43.532
Of course Kundalini is a part,

00:01:43.861 --> 00:01:48.852
or we can say reflection, of Adi Shakti, and also

00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:09.099
the Jagadamba is also part of Adi Shakti.

00:02:30.305 --> 00:02:39.037
She is placed in the center of two Hearts,

00:02:40.817 --> 00:02:43.425
which is a very important point.

00:02:45.235 --> 00:02:52.467
Now, all these powers are placed in that chakra.

00:02:53.738 --> 00:02:57.569
So, you imagine how many of these powers must be.

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:06.613
And Her powers are expressed through

00:03:06.806 --> 00:03:15.649
the center Heart in all the Ganas you have around your body.

00:03:17.892 --> 00:03:23.674
Now these Ganas are the ones who do give you the protection,

00:03:24.774 --> 00:03:32.541
give you the sleep, give you the energy, give you the blessings

00:03:33.458 --> 00:03:37.027
- all of them are at work all the time -

00:03:38.541 --> 00:03:47.957
and these bodies are extremely dedicated

00:03:48.808 --> 00:03:52.414
and connected all the time to the Mother

00:03:53.174 --> 00:03:56.201
Amba: we can call, Jagadamba.

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:02.276
Now She is the Mother of the universe;

00:04:03.205 --> 00:04:04.963
so, you can imagine it,

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:09.819
how busy She has to be to look after the whole universe.

00:04:14.026 --> 00:04:16.509
When this center becomes weak,

00:04:19.071 --> 00:04:25.388
that means Her connection with the Ganas is reduced.

00:04:26.073 --> 00:04:28.692
Ganas also are weak,

00:04:29.486 --> 00:04:36.583
and all the powers that could be exercised,

00:04:37.049 --> 00:04:41.802
cannot be done because of this weakness.

00:04:44.535 --> 00:04:48.775
It's a very subtle center

00:04:49.383 --> 00:04:52.373
because it is Mother's center;

00:04:52.736 --> 00:04:56.001
is impossible to understand the love of Mother.

00:04:57.498 --> 00:05:00.593
It's absolutely impossible.

00:05:01.675 --> 00:05:05.788
When the girls get married, and they become mothers,

00:05:06.003 --> 00:05:07.894
then they start understanding

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:12.450
how much their mother must have done for them to come up.

00:05:13.186 --> 00:05:21.687
In the same way, when Sahaja Yogis become good Sahaja Yogis,

00:05:23.353 --> 00:05:27.114
like Ganas, they realize how much

00:05:27.296 --> 00:05:32.120
the Ganas had to have patience, had to have love

00:05:32.314 --> 00:05:36.123
and intelligence, to fight the negativity.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.973
So, all the forces of the Jagadamba act towards

00:05:42.204 --> 00:05:45.081
hitting the negativity of all kinds.

00:05:46.772 --> 00:05:49.962
That is Her first and foremost nature

00:05:50.191 --> 00:05:52.776
- is to destroy all the negativity

00:05:53.026 --> 00:06:00.577
that is in this world and is against Sahaj, against you.

00:06:04.622 --> 00:06:08.652
Her destruction takes place in so many ways.

00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:16.178
First of all, we have to know that if you sin against the Goddess,

00:06:17.359 --> 00:06:21.820
then all kinds of physical problems start

00:06:22.206 --> 00:06:26.140
- like psychosomatic diseases, all kinds:

00:06:28.873 --> 00:06:34.579
we can say cancer, AIDS, all of them.

00:06:35.296 --> 00:06:37.777
But some of the diseases

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:43.094
have got also the mixed up with the Ganapati.

00:06:43.775 --> 00:06:49.634
Now Ganapati is the Lord of all the Ganas.

00:06:50.133 --> 00:06:55.989
So, the Mother has Ganapati, and She controls all these Ganas

00:06:56.285 --> 00:07:02.301
through her son Ganapati. It is so connected.

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:07.469
So the sin against the Mother when we do

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.885
- means when we become immoral.

00:07:10.134 --> 00:07:16.517
Immoral means when we start indulging into things

00:07:18.264 --> 00:07:21.255
which are not permitted by dharma.

00:07:22.694 --> 00:07:26.175
By dharma whatever is permitted is the legal.

00:07:27.412 --> 00:07:30.009
Now you people understand Sahaj dharma

00:07:30.352 --> 00:07:33.082
innately, from within. I didn't have to tell you.

00:07:33.263 --> 00:07:37.052
Now you know this is wrong, is wrong, this is right, this is right.

00:07:37.487 --> 00:07:42.806
So any such things when you try to do,

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.181
because She is a Mother, She takes time to punish you.

00:07:49.312 --> 00:07:53.243
No doubt. But if you commit a sin against the Father,

00:07:53.382 --> 00:07:57.669
like boastfulness, talking big, being cruel, harsh and all that

00:07:57.894 --> 00:08:01.613
- immediately the punishment comes in.

00:08:03.063 --> 00:08:08.317
But from Her, She being the Ocean of compassion,

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:12.444
the punishment is more delayed,

00:08:13.099 --> 00:08:20.202
and a full chance is given to the person to improve himself

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:25.341
and guide himself. But when the punishment starts,

00:08:25.642 --> 00:08:31.735
then you get into diseases which are of a very serious nature.

00:08:34.291 --> 00:08:39.277
So it comes from one thing, what we call as
fear.

00:08:40.051 --> 00:08:47.241
When somebody frightens you or aggresses you,

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.171
or becomes like a maskit as they say;

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:57.695
somebody who is oppressed by aggressive people

00:08:59.441 --> 00:09:04.917
or is threatened, intimidated,

00:09:05.949 --> 00:09:11.184
then a person starts losing faith in the powers of Mother.

00:09:11.899 --> 00:09:16.700
As a result, such a person -

00:09:17.734 --> 00:09:22.035
The child is talking too much. Can you take away the child from there?

00:09:22.035 --> 00:09:26.182
Where is he? Outside?

00:09:27.162 --> 00:09:31.364
Ask them to control the children.

00:09:31.784 --> 00:09:34.078
You must control. This is negative child who is talking.

00:09:36.832 --> 00:09:40.846
Who is the child? Whose child it is?

00:09:42.246 --> 00:09:43.576
Who is that?

00:09:47.543 --> 00:09:50.083
Please look after your child; it's not normal.

00:09:51.016 --> 00:09:57.957
Normally, children who are all right become very quiet during My speech.

00:10:06.405 --> 00:10:09.268
Now take him- take her out, ask her to take her out.

00:10:43.529 --> 00:10:48.266
So, this Center Heart is to be looked after.

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:54.441
Out of fear, if somebody is thrown on to the left side,

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.852
away from the Mother,

00:10:59.362 --> 00:11:02.434
because She is the one who gives us confidence,

00:11:02.894 --> 00:11:06.743
who gives us courage and bravery.

00:11:07.616 --> 00:11:12.886
But if you are frightened, or if you are under fear,

00:11:13.741 --> 00:11:17.324
also you can be thrown to the left side;

00:11:17.574 --> 00:11:21.899
and you can get into all kind of diseases

00:11:22.038 --> 00:11:26.471
which are very serious, incurable as they call them.

00:11:27.905 --> 00:11:34.167
Another thing is if you are driven by your senses

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:42.103
into indulgences without any dharma,

00:11:43.004 --> 00:11:50.972
then also this central path throws away, you can say,

00:11:51.098 --> 00:11:54.978
you to the left side, because you are not worthy of being

00:11:55.175 --> 00:11:57.736
at the lotus feet of the Mother.

00:12:02.559 --> 00:12:09.214
Now, this center is the one which when we are afraid,

00:12:09.438 --> 00:12:11.512
the sternum bone starts

00:12:11.791 --> 00:12:14.375
moving like a remote control and informs

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:17.319
all the Ganas that the attack is coming.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.609
But when you deliberately go to the left side,

00:12:23.867 --> 00:12:27.756
and get into indulgences, then they are not bothered.

00:12:28.791 --> 00:12:31.659
They said, "All right, go ahead, do what you like;

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.780
you can behave the way you want to behave".

00:12:34.995 --> 00:12:42.276
All these different types of movements towards the left,

00:12:42.488 --> 00:12:45.808
takes you away from your Mother.

00:12:48.565 --> 00:12:51.637
I'll tell you a story about somebody in America.

00:12:52.174 --> 00:12:54.860
He is a very old Sahaja Yogi, Indian.

00:12:55.184 --> 00:12:58.922
He came out of his shop, where he was working,

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:03.002
and got into his car - there was one man sitting with a dagger.

00:13:03.183 --> 00:13:06.572
And he hit him with the dagger on the center Heart.

00:13:06.758 --> 00:13:08.754
And this fellow started bleeding.

00:13:09.043 --> 00:13:11.571
He said, " I don't know what happened to me, Mother.

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:13.308
I got such strength,

00:13:13.567 --> 00:13:16.175
I caught hold of him and I started fighting with him,

00:13:16.335 --> 00:13:18.818
and I took the dagger from him.

00:13:18.998 --> 00:13:22.812
He had the handle and the dagger came into my hand.

00:13:23.115 --> 00:13:25.133
And the fellow ran away.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.756
But still I was not worried about my bleeding.

00:13:30.171 --> 00:13:31.780
What I did

00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:35.072
- I called my colleague who was coming out of the car,

00:13:35.256 --> 00:13:36.885
I ran after him

00:13:37.024 --> 00:13:40.229
and he took me in his car for half-an-hour searching that fellow".

00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:42.593
They didn't go to the police.

00:13:42.826 --> 00:13:45.782
And then they went to the police. The police was surprised,

00:13:45.941 --> 00:13:49.577
the whole shirt was full of blood.

00:13:49.931 --> 00:13:52.724
He said, "Nobody would believe". Even the police was shocked.

00:13:53.226 --> 00:13:55.455
"For half an hour you were searching this fellow.

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:57.313
Why didn't you come to the police?"

00:13:57.476 --> 00:13:59.932
He said, "It would have taken half-an-hour for you to come,

00:14:00.091 --> 00:14:02.758
so we thought, better do it ourselves".

00:14:02.988 --> 00:14:04.348
See the courage!

00:14:06.044 --> 00:14:09.052
Then, of course, he was taken to the hospital,

00:14:09.261 --> 00:14:10.904
and he was all right.

00:14:11.242 --> 00:14:14.666
Just they stitched him up. But he is all right.

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:18.028
That is the sign of a person

00:14:18.347 --> 00:14:22.543
who can never get any one of these horrible diseases,

00:14:23.192 --> 00:14:28.317
because there is no fear in his mind, of any kind.

00:14:30.611 --> 00:14:31.814
And, he is an Indian,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.173
he said: "I have never even slapped my own children.

00:14:34.353 --> 00:14:36.380
I have never fought with anyone.

00:14:36.559 --> 00:14:39.570
I am not a wrestler by any chance, nothing of the kind.

00:14:39.784 --> 00:14:41.144
But it happened".

00:14:41.332 --> 00:14:44.218
He says, "I don't know how, from where I got this shakti;

00:14:44.417 --> 00:14:47.582
and how I did it, I just don't know".

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:50.007
There are many stories like

00:14:50.159 --> 00:14:52.728
this they can tell you about Sahaja Yogis,

00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:58.992
and about so many saints, how they were never afraid of

00:15:03.952 --> 00:15:07.579
attacking someone when somebody attacks them,

00:15:07.961 --> 00:15:10.063
or of protecting themselves

00:15:10.361 --> 00:15:13.610
from all kinds of horrible things with their courage.

00:15:14.092 --> 00:15:18.370
This is something one cannot believe sometimes,

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:20.717
but it is happening, every day,

00:15:20.915 --> 00:15:24.025
I get letters from people how they have been courageous.

00:15:25.016 --> 00:15:27.082
If you believe in the Goddess,

00:15:27.495 --> 00:15:30.710
then know that She is extremely powerful;

00:15:30.943 --> 00:15:33.130
She is very intelligent;

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:36.278
and if She has to protect you, She will protect you

00:15:36.444 --> 00:15:39.808
out and out, in such a way that

00:15:40.026 --> 00:15:42.855
you will not know how you have been protected.

00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:46.149
But  this faith has to be developed.

00:15:46.546 --> 00:15:49.490
Faith has to be developed by experience also,

00:15:49.641 --> 00:15:51.834
how you have been protected always;

00:15:51.963 --> 00:15:53.923
how you have been helped always;

00:15:54.062 --> 00:15:56.129
how you came out of so many crises.

00:15:56.323 --> 00:16:00.327
But despite that if you get upset, worried,

00:16:00.566 --> 00:16:04.780
if some clouds appear in the sky of your life,

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.820
then if you get upset, that means you are still weak.

00:16:09.043 --> 00:16:12.828
So first thing, if you are really worshipping the Goddess,

00:16:13.008 --> 00:16:16.446
then you should have no worry at all of any kind,

00:16:16.625 --> 00:16:21.577
and you should have no fear at all. Go ahead, fearlessly.

00:16:21.914 --> 00:16:24.710
Whatever you are doing, do it fearlessly.

00:16:26.021 --> 00:16:28.529
But at the same time I have to tell you the other side,

00:16:28.693 --> 00:16:34.217
that one should not go about like a zombie,

00:16:34.454 --> 00:16:36.134
it doesn't mean that;

00:16:36.398 --> 00:16:39.276
saying all kinds of nonsensical things of the right side.

00:16:39.495 --> 00:16:41.808
But if you have to do something,

00:16:42.014 --> 00:16:44.506
do it with clear-cut ideas,

00:16:44.769 --> 00:16:48.352
and also without any fear.

00:16:50.305 --> 00:16:53.590
So all Her powers, you start manifesting it.

00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:57.925
A man who is fearless has nothing to worry

00:16:58.123 --> 00:17:02.567
about his sleep, his well-being, nothing.

00:17:03.296 --> 00:17:05.039
He is fearless.

00:17:05.893 --> 00:17:08.793
Again I say, 'fearless' doesn't mean that

00:17:08.973 --> 00:17:12.286
you go on hitting everybody, saying all kinds of things, no.

00:17:12.438 --> 00:17:14.878
It means that you are fearless:

00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:18.092
anybody who attacks you, you can always protect yourself.

00:17:18.291 --> 00:17:20.357
I mean, this story I told you,

00:17:20.532 --> 00:17:22.928
because this was not a protection

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:24.977
which was from within, like

00:17:25.346 --> 00:17:27.218
Goddess protecting them,

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:29.457
but actually protected himself.

00:17:30.623 --> 00:17:33.588
So the power had started working through him.

00:17:34.228 --> 00:17:37.511
You should allow your mind, your body

00:17:38.384 --> 00:17:40.064
to project these powers.

00:17:40.788 --> 00:17:44.376
Otherwise we say here pujas, everything, all right;

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.154
and the power is there;

00:17:47.479 --> 00:17:51.887
but your mind which tells you, "No, no, no, this is not so".

00:17:52.209 --> 00:17:55.161
There's so many stories,

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:59.943
so many miracles people have described about this.

00:18:00.472 --> 00:18:04.824
So, first of all, you should not have any fear about anything.

00:18:05.082 --> 00:18:07.308
If you have done nothing wrong,

00:18:08.758 --> 00:18:11.951
if you are on the right path, you will be always protected.

00:18:12.421 --> 00:18:16.536
Now remember this: you will be always protected.

00:18:17.265 --> 00:18:20.094
Remember this and believe in this,

00:18:20.611 --> 00:18:22.611
that, "I am always protected".

00:18:23.448 --> 00:18:25.722
This is something very difficult,

00:18:25.973 --> 00:18:28.758
because perhaps our mind gives ideas,

00:18:28.864 --> 00:18:31.813
"Oh God, what will happen now; what is going to happen?

00:18:31.972 --> 00:18:33.652
This thing, that thing".

00:18:36.063 --> 00:18:39.745
So, first and foremost thing, as I said,

00:18:39.925 --> 00:18:46.194
is to be fearless - to make the Goddess express Herself.

00:18:47.512 --> 00:18:49.475
Supposing now, take it like this:

00:18:49.658 --> 00:18:51.897
now all Ganas are following you.

00:18:52.375 --> 00:18:59.655
Now if the leader of an army is a frightened personality,

00:19:00.033 --> 00:19:01.713
what will others do?

00:19:04.289 --> 00:19:11.387
Thus, you become dependent upon yourself.

00:19:13.167 --> 00:19:16.089
This faith also must be developed.

00:19:16.368 --> 00:19:19.264
I have seen people who are sick

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.874
- so they must come and see Me,

00:19:22.088 --> 00:19:25.221
because they do not depend upon themselves. They can

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.971
cure themselves. There is no need for them to come and see Me.

00:19:29.147 --> 00:19:32.968
There are many cases where people have cured themselves,

00:19:33.247 --> 00:19:36.024
cured others, just with prayer.

00:19:36.265 --> 00:19:41.442
But the faith, when it is not matured,

00:19:41.642 --> 00:19:44.213
then they think I, I should treat them.

00:19:44.392 --> 00:19:46.692
I should touch them, I should do this, I should do that.

00:19:46.838 --> 00:19:48.518
Now I have stopped it.

00:19:48.703 --> 00:19:50.470
I used to do once upon a time.

00:19:50.609 --> 00:19:53.239
Reason is, now you depend upon yourself.

00:19:53.617 --> 00:19:55.673
Not only that you can

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:57.964
help yourself, but you are going to help others.

00:19:58.104 --> 00:20:00.833
But if you do not have faith in yourself,

00:20:01.012 --> 00:20:05.269
that you can cure, you can look after yourself,

00:20:05.449 --> 00:20:08.246
you can protect yourself; so the whole

00:20:08.484 --> 00:20:10.658
thing becomes like a ...

00:20:10.838 --> 00:20:13.638
all the time the Mother has to do the job.

00:20:15.372 --> 00:20:18.896
Now you, first of all, you have to feed the little baby;

00:20:19.056 --> 00:20:20.056
all right?

00:20:20.207 --> 00:20:24.576
You can get him aid, look after him, do everything.

00:20:24.768 --> 00:20:26.302
But when he grows up,

00:20:26.461 --> 00:20:29.528
then he doesn't want his mother to feed him.

00:20:29.746 --> 00:20:32.027
In the same way, the Sahaja Yogis now,

00:20:32.187 --> 00:20:34.111
how many years I have been working.

00:20:34.309 --> 00:20:40.400
You have to grow up dignified and you should mature,

00:20:40.846 --> 00:20:45.560
so that you can yourself do things properly.

00:20:47.465 --> 00:20:52.754
This maturity is there because your Mother has blessed you.

00:20:53.509 --> 00:20:57.283
All Her powers She has given you - every.

00:20:58.911 --> 00:21:04.716
But one power, of patience, is difficult.

00:21:06.482 --> 00:21:09.216
You have to be patient like your Mother.

00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:13.639
You might think it's very difficult. But try to be.

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:17.129
Must have patience, first of all, with yourself.

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:19.334
I have known many people

00:21:19.553 --> 00:21:21.405
who think they are spiritually nothing

00:21:21.563 --> 00:21:23.280
and they have not achieved anything.

00:21:24.927 --> 00:21:28.796
This is absolutely a sort of a escapicism,

00:21:29.351 --> 00:21:32.151
that you want to escape your personality.

00:21:32.328 --> 00:21:35.216
Just see. If you introspect, you will find out

00:21:35.395 --> 00:21:40.446
that you have developed into a real spiritual giant now.

00:21:40.685 --> 00:21:42.365
Nobody can touch you;

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:46.431
you can do everything; you can look after yourself;

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:48.250
you can support others.

00:21:48.911 --> 00:21:51.649
Whatever are the powers

00:21:51.867 --> 00:21:54.875
of all these that they were singing yesterday,

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:59.159
all these powers are manifesting in you.

00:21:59.498 --> 00:22:03.676
But still you leave it to chance and,

00:22:03.855 --> 00:22:07.375
I should say, you leave it to others, not to yourself.

00:22:10.398 --> 00:22:14.239
Now this is one point

00:22:14.418 --> 00:22:18.763
that no one, so far, has done this kind of a job

00:22:19.002 --> 00:22:24.140
- is to connect all the disciples to the Divine power.

00:22:27.354 --> 00:22:30.877
Because it is the Divine power of love,

00:22:31.017 --> 00:22:35.969
you must know how to love others. That's very important.

00:22:36.227 --> 00:22:38.778
But again, when it comes to love,

00:22:38.996 --> 00:22:41.169
they will love their child, love their wife;

00:22:41.328 --> 00:22:43.617
I mean it is very common in Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:43.816 --> 00:22:46.794
They are too attached to their children. Before this,

00:22:46.992 --> 00:22:50.080
they were known to be absolutely selfish,

00:22:50.337 --> 00:22:54.048
had no attachment for children or wife or anything.

00:22:54.345 --> 00:22:56.145
But now it is like a glue.

00:22:56.687 --> 00:23:00.011
Children are glued to them, wife is glued to them

00:23:00.171 --> 00:23:02.371
and the family - very important.

00:23:03.343 --> 00:23:08.020
This is another temptation from which you have to get out.

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:11.495
I am not saying that you have to give up your family or your child.

00:23:11.655 --> 00:23:13.921
But, again I say, the detachment.

00:23:14.651 --> 00:23:17.825
The detachment is your power.

00:23:20.008 --> 00:23:22.678
Watch everything with detachment.

00:23:22.877 --> 00:23:24.297
Now don't think that,

00:23:24.417 --> 00:23:27.928
 "Oh, I came only a few days back in Sahaja Yoga". No.

00:23:28.167 --> 00:23:31.987
Don't think, "Somebody is higher than me; I am no good". No.

00:23:32.365 --> 00:23:38.495
You just introspect yourself and see for yourself

00:23:38.972 --> 00:23:43.317
how many powers you have already got.

00:23:44.329 --> 00:23:48.686
And the more you'll know, the more you'll become humble.

00:23:49.639 --> 00:23:53.765
It's very surprising. You'll become humble.

00:23:54.361 --> 00:23:56.555
No fear of any kind.

00:23:56.753 --> 00:24:00.217
You can have fear if you have some,

00:24:00.417 --> 00:24:02.283
say, lot of money with you.

00:24:02.522 --> 00:24:06.746
If you are very well educated, you might have fear of jealousies.

00:24:07.006 --> 00:24:11.263
If you have other wealth like ornaments and things, you will be

00:24:11.423 --> 00:24:13.890
afraid of big thieves coming around.

00:24:14.736 --> 00:24:18.337
If you are a politician, you might be afraid

00:24:18.635 --> 00:24:23.079
that somebody might take away your seat when you are away.

00:24:23.952 --> 00:24:29.816
But, when it comes really to Sahaja Yoga, it's the other way round.

00:24:30.972 --> 00:24:33.466
Who can steal your Self-realization?

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:42.295
Tell me! Who can steal your powers?

00:24:43.009 --> 00:24:47.882
Who can steal your vibrations? Think of it.

00:24:49.708 --> 00:24:53.497
And who can steal your love?

00:24:55.641 --> 00:24:58.628
Because it is coming from the Spirit,

00:24:58.986 --> 00:25:02.735
which is eternal, and the flow is all the time there.

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:05.617
Only when you go away from your Spirit,

00:25:07.576 --> 00:25:13.528
then only you feel all these things,

00:25:13.708 --> 00:25:15.841
which one feels in the darkness.

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:26.964
Then another power of Mother is that She gives you

00:25:27.242 --> 00:25:31.448
a state in which you are a sakshi, you are a witness,

00:25:31.705 --> 00:25:33.449
watching everything.

00:25:34.739 --> 00:25:36.739
You have tremendous patience;

00:25:39.441 --> 00:25:41.068
tremendous patience.

00:25:41.761 --> 00:25:44.074
Whatever's happened, all right, let it be.

00:25:44.273 --> 00:25:47.110
This will be all right, that will be all right, this and that.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:51.111
So you get rid of a horrible thing called anger.

00:25:52.047 --> 00:25:59.169
And this gives you such a peaceful witness state,

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:02.428
that you start becoming younger and younger.

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:04.809
I will tell you, some Sahaja Yogis

00:26:04.988 --> 00:26:07.368
whom I gave Realization, say, last year,

00:26:07.785 --> 00:26:10.287
this year I met them - I could not recognize.

00:26:10.446 --> 00:26:13.144
They have suddenly become ten years younger.

00:26:14.097 --> 00:26:18.950
It's very surprising. And I was Myself,

00:26:19.153 --> 00:26:22.175
had to confess that I really, I can't recognize

00:26:22.375 --> 00:26:26.535
that are you the same people, or are you the son of that fellow?

00:26:30.787 --> 00:26:34.191
So then, what happens to you

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:38.279
is that you become a peaceful personality. Why?

00:26:39.131 --> 00:26:41.823
Because your Mother is there always.

00:26:42.319 --> 00:26:46.307
This faith: She is always there, She is always with us,

00:26:46.445 --> 00:26:48.619
always protecting us:

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:52.469
but now we are grown up, so She has given us all the powers.

00:26:52.668 --> 00:26:55.239
All the property She has given us; so what,

00:26:55.895 --> 00:26:57.961
what is there to be afraid of?

00:26:59.585 --> 00:27:04.386
But this faith has to be not just a blind faith,

00:27:04.565 --> 00:27:06.501
but an enlightened faith.

00:27:07.485 --> 00:27:10.501
Now the difference is, in blind faith

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:12.740
you have faith but no powers.

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:16.908
In enlightened faith, you have faith and all the powers.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:25.739
When that happens to you, you start growing very much fast

00:27:26.077 --> 00:27:28.092
- first in your dharma.

00:27:28.668 --> 00:27:31.268
And you are not afraid of your virtues.

00:27:33.162 --> 00:27:39.917
You tell people, talk about Sahaja Yoga everywhere,

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:42.304
and it works, it clicks.

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.483
Once you don't have any fear,

00:27:45.623 --> 00:27:48.289
the whole picture will be clear to you,

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:50.803
because you become a visionary:

00:27:51.535 --> 00:27:54.002
what we call in Sanskrit 'drishtas'.

00:27:54.234 --> 00:27:58.340
Like see how C. S. Lewis could see our procession.

00:27:58.809 --> 00:28:02.737
How could William Blake predict our future?

00:28:02.975 --> 00:28:04.307
How could

00:28:06.281 --> 00:28:08.747
Gyaneshwara, wrote about 'Pasayadan',

00:28:08.906 --> 00:28:11.346
which is a description of all the Sahaja Yogis?

00:28:11.491 --> 00:28:14.712
But all the time he is saying, "Now you get up and walk,

00:28:14.851 --> 00:28:17.768
and do this, you are that, now you've got it".

00:28:17.905 --> 00:28:20.805
He is trying to assure people all the time.

00:28:21.617 --> 00:28:26.438
How could Rabindranath Tagore see our going to Ganapatipule?

00:28:27.054 --> 00:28:28.654
How could it happen?

00:28:28.884 --> 00:28:32.269
It happens only when people are

00:28:32.566 --> 00:28:34.880
in enlightened faith.

00:28:38.988 --> 00:28:42.630
In enlightened faith your Mother

00:28:42.908 --> 00:28:47.443
gives you another very great power, is of discretion;

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:49.060
of discretion.

00:28:49.283 --> 00:28:52.217
Somebody came to me, "Mother, You see,

00:28:52.883 --> 00:28:55.414
this gentleman is very good, this, that;

00:28:55.553 --> 00:29:00.176
and You know nobody has looked after him, this, that.

00:29:00.355 --> 00:29:03.422
He is very well educated, very moneyed person, this, that".

00:29:03.601 --> 00:29:05.882
I said, "All right, show Me the photograph".

00:29:06.477 --> 00:29:09.088
I saw the photograph. I said, "No

00:29:09.644 --> 00:29:12.244
- yes,better keep him out. Absolutely.

00:29:12.442 --> 00:29:15.021
Keep him out!" He was amazed.

00:29:15.359 --> 00:29:17.959
"How You say keep him out absolutely?"

00:29:18.295 --> 00:29:21.184
I saw the photograph, and in the photograph only

00:29:21.402 --> 00:29:24.866
how could Mother say that? I could feel the vibrations.

00:29:25.383 --> 00:29:28.846
Immediately I said, "It's wrong".

00:29:29.303 --> 00:29:33.331
One gentleman came here and told Me that some

00:29:33.569 --> 00:29:36.021
Nigerians have written letter to him,

00:29:36.172 --> 00:29:38.028
that, "You put thirty-five

00:29:39.894 --> 00:29:43.358
thousand pounds in the bank", or something like that,

00:29:43.714 --> 00:29:48.051
"and we'll put our money, quite a lot, in millions,

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:50.943
and then you can have one third of that".

00:29:52.258 --> 00:29:54.889
He came and told Me this story. I said, "Really?

00:29:55.186 --> 00:30:00.562
Keep out of it". So he said, "Why?" "It's a scam".

00:30:01.476 --> 00:30:04.880
When he went back to America, they found it was a scam.

00:30:05.992 --> 00:30:07.758
He said, "Mother, how did you know?"

00:30:08.056 --> 00:30:11.064
I said, "You can feel the vibrations, so hot!

00:30:12.083 --> 00:30:13.702
So, it is a scam".

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:19.448
You have got vibrations. You can feel your vibrations.

00:30:19.567 --> 00:30:23.190
Now if you don't want to use this new awareness,

00:30:23.369 --> 00:30:25.846
what is the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga?

00:30:26.065 --> 00:30:29.172
He was very upset when I told him, "Forget it".

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:30.750
He thought:

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:32.690
"Why Mother is saying so?"

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:35.188
I said, "Now what do you need money for? You need money?

00:30:35.287 --> 00:30:37.549
All right. We have. Don't take these things".

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:42.727
When I told him it's a scam, he got a shock.

00:30:43.212 --> 00:30:46.418
When he went back, he found out it was a scam. So

00:30:46.637 --> 00:30:53.037
at the airport only, he was on My feet prostrated.

00:30:53.161 --> 00:30:54.537
I said, "What happened?"

00:30:54.657 --> 00:30:57.533
"Mother, You are the limit. What You said is there".

00:30:57.653 --> 00:31:02.136
I said, "But it was the vibrations which told Me that he

00:31:02.375 --> 00:31:06.323
is a cheat. So, if he says so,

00:31:07.334 --> 00:31:09.676
that he is going to give you so much money,

00:31:09.935 --> 00:31:13.537
is not correct because his vibrations were so very bad".

00:31:15.145 --> 00:31:23.577
In this way, you can gradually experience.

00:31:24.232 --> 00:31:28.413
With the experience, try to put the experience in your heart

00:31:29.068 --> 00:31:32.579
and have faith in that experience.

00:31:34.266 --> 00:31:37.730
What were you? What have you become now?

00:31:38.068 --> 00:31:41.204
How many experiences of Sahaja Yoga you had?

00:31:41.422 --> 00:31:46.581
- of the Mother's attention on you.

00:31:47.692 --> 00:31:52.922
Now if you have that enlightened faith, enlightened faith in you,

00:31:53.241 --> 00:31:54.921
you become powerful...

00:31:56.255 --> 00:31:59.808
You are powerless, because your faith is like this.

00:32:02.526 --> 00:32:08.286
But if you become really a evolved, matured

00:32:09.383 --> 00:32:13.927
realized soul, then all your powers will work.

00:32:15.552 --> 00:32:17.823
There's a fisherman in India,

00:32:33.974 --> 00:32:35.652
who is

00:32:36.565 --> 00:32:39.929
- I mean, he is a graduate though he is a fisherman.

00:32:40.466 --> 00:32:44.612
So one day, he was going on a boat

00:32:45.009 --> 00:32:48.501
to another island to do Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:49.552 --> 00:32:52.381
And when he came out of his hut, he found

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:55.040
huge big clouds, black ones,

00:32:55.259 --> 00:32:57.726
hovering and the Vishnumaya playing.

00:32:58.453 --> 00:33:00.253
Just he stood on the shore

00:33:00.793 --> 00:33:02.590
and told Vishnumaya,

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:05.842
"Please tell these clouds to behave themselves.

00:33:06.064 --> 00:33:07.941
I am going for the work of Mother,

00:33:08.145 --> 00:33:11.409
and dare not trouble me on the way". Just told it.

00:33:12.111 --> 00:33:14.464
The people who were with him, told me that

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:17.243
this Harishchandra was talking like that.

00:33:17.442 --> 00:33:20.112
They got into the boat. They did the program,

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:25.390
came home. When he went into his boat, the rain started.

00:33:26.681 --> 00:33:32.672
So you control all five elements by your enlightened faith.

00:33:34.727 --> 00:33:37.893
For which you don't even have to say anything.

00:33:38.608 --> 00:33:41.208
The powers are so great that they act.

00:33:41.446 --> 00:33:45.366
See now: today when the Puja was to be done,

00:33:45.545 --> 00:33:48.411
suddenly it became pleasant. I didn't ask.

00:33:49.136 --> 00:33:53.838
Just it became pleasant, much better than yesterday:

00:33:54.215 --> 00:33:56.806
could have been very cold.

00:33:57.342 --> 00:34:04.338
But this should become again, a faith which is reality.

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:08.762
If you remember last time, we had a horrible rain

00:34:08.910 --> 00:34:12.889
and the whole thing was jumping up and people had to

00:34:13.128 --> 00:34:16.433
pull all these pillars down.

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:21.255
As soon as they started saying My 'Jai', it stopped.

00:34:22.188 --> 00:34:24.721
Now, this experience should make you;

00:34:25.103 --> 00:34:27.504
there was no need for you to pull the...

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:33.635
these pillars, but you had to just sing My 'Jai', that's all.

00:34:33.872 --> 00:34:35.827
Instead of that, you were busy with pulling

00:34:35.950 --> 00:34:37.630
all of you that thing.

00:34:37.783 --> 00:34:40.036
I was just looking at you, I didn't know

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:42.596
what to say anything; I said, "Let them try".

00:34:43.171 --> 00:34:48.043
So these ordeals also come to make you mature.

00:34:48.202 --> 00:34:51.090
These ordeals if they are not there,

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:56.518
these ordeals if they do not come,

00:34:56.662 --> 00:34:59.713
then you will not supersede them;

00:34:59.872 --> 00:35:02.193
and if you will not supersede them,

00:35:02.352 --> 00:35:04.886
you will not know what is your faith.

00:35:05.447 --> 00:35:08.740
A person who is standing on the shore

00:35:09.038 --> 00:35:11.200
will say, "I don't know how to swim".

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.407
But supposing you made him jump into the water

00:35:14.567 --> 00:35:18.673
and he swims, then he knows that he can swim.

00:35:20.856 --> 00:35:23.800
Because you do not know what you have become.

00:35:25.102 --> 00:35:27.436
You do not know that you can swim.

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.689
You do not know that you can also save others.

00:35:30.781 --> 00:35:32.301
You are still busy

00:35:32.447 --> 00:35:35.007
with small, small, little, little things here and there.

00:35:36.063 --> 00:35:40.403
But if you just know what you have become,

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:49.169
then you are going to completely change.

00:35:49.964 --> 00:35:56.542
Your smallness, which looks like a little particle,

00:35:57.059 --> 00:35:58.792
will cover the whole sky.

00:36:00.293 --> 00:36:03.467
But this power that is within you,

00:36:03.916 --> 00:36:05.596
will not give you ego.

00:36:06.495 --> 00:36:09.395
One thing, the test is, it makes you humble.

00:36:10.961 --> 00:36:14.044
This is one of the things: that it makes you humble,

00:36:14.184 --> 00:36:16.851
and extremely loving and compassionate.

00:36:17.032 --> 00:36:21.320
You will not hurt other people with these powers; that's the sign:

00:36:21.576 --> 00:36:26.270
it is Mother's love, power of Mother's love.

00:36:26.707 --> 00:36:30.794
A person who has a mother, very loving and nice,

00:36:30.973 --> 00:36:32.773
it's a psychological fact,

00:36:33.155 --> 00:36:35.449
becomes a very nice person;

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.019
it's a psychological fact.

00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:44.627
So now if you realize what you are now,

00:36:45.047 --> 00:36:46.705
what you have become.

00:36:46.923 --> 00:36:49.792
Navaratri Puja is, that's why, is a very, very

00:36:49.951 --> 00:36:51.578
powerful Puja in a way:

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:58.645
because it manifests, opens out

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:03.380
the channels of your power, that's why it's very, very
important;

00:37:03.526 --> 00:37:08.379
and since morning I have been just

00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:13.113
flowing with vibrations, tremendous, it was like a

00:37:13.272 --> 00:37:16.545
waterfall of vibrations.

00:37:16.724 --> 00:37:19.918
And the whole time I am seeing light, light, light, light; I was

00:37:20.078 --> 00:37:23.986
thinking, "Now I don't know what am I going to speak or something"

00:37:24.165 --> 00:37:25.803
That's why I closed My eyes,

00:37:25.962 --> 00:37:28.442
because all the time there will be something else

00:37:28.601 --> 00:37:31.101
I will be seeing and not you people; so better, I thought,

00:37:31.181 --> 00:37:32.781
I'll close My eyes.

00:37:33.223 --> 00:37:38.855
But now you are the light. You are the light.

00:37:40.272 --> 00:37:44.213
Light is not afraid of darkness, is it?

00:37:45.781 --> 00:37:48.247
Because, it can remove the darkness.

00:37:48.975 --> 00:37:52.431
That's what you are, but you don't know what you are,

00:37:53.261 --> 00:37:57.387
and you live with very small, very small

00:37:57.681 --> 00:38:00.172
ideas about yourself.

00:38:01.005 --> 00:38:05.679
I am not saying that you should become like gurus

00:38:05.839 --> 00:38:10.462
that go round talking big, with two horns on their head, no.

00:38:11.038 --> 00:38:13.771
What is your decoration is your humility,

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:18.529
is your kindness, is your sweetness,

00:38:18.807 --> 00:38:20.874
and the way you handle people.

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:24.017
You will be amazed, I also tell people

00:38:24.177 --> 00:38:28.006
when I find there is something wrong with them. I also do it,

00:38:28.185 --> 00:38:30.783
no doubt; but in a way

00:38:31.065 --> 00:38:33.632
that the person understands it is for the

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:35.590
benevolence of that person.

00:38:36.042 --> 00:38:43.288
So the whole personality, the whole temperament,

00:38:44.434 --> 00:38:50.664
everything changes; the whole face changes;

00:38:52.172 --> 00:38:54.287
the whole movement changes.

00:38:54.466 --> 00:38:56.466
The style of talking changes,

00:38:57.224 --> 00:39:02.520
automatically as if you know the machinery has changed, within.

00:39:05.259 --> 00:39:11.509
So you develop the qualities of a real Mahayogi.

00:39:14.431 --> 00:39:20.786
This Mahayogi condition is achieved by many people also before,

00:39:27.473 --> 00:39:31.223
but they had to go through very circuitous life.

00:39:32.989 --> 00:39:36.988
They had to give up everything, not to show, but

00:39:37.148 --> 00:39:39.948
really from the heart they had to detach.

00:39:40.243 --> 00:39:44.132
They had to get out of it, go to some far-fetched places,

00:39:44.648 --> 00:39:46.652
and live on ordinary food.

00:39:47.088 --> 00:39:50.493
All kinds of even Buddha suffered so much.

00:39:51.246 --> 00:39:53.301
Christ suffered so much.

00:39:53.639 --> 00:39:56.615
They were Incarnations but still they had to suffer.

00:39:56.834 --> 00:40:01.270
Rama suffered so much; Shri Krishna suffered so much: imagine.

00:40:01.865 --> 00:40:04.399
Now you people didn't have to suffer.

00:40:04.961 --> 00:40:08.225
On the contrary you all came out of the suffering:

00:40:09.385 --> 00:40:12.559
enjoyment, music, everything.

00:40:16.726 --> 00:40:23.933
But to enjoy Sahaja Yoga, in Niranand

00:40:24.508 --> 00:40:28.959
- absolutely without anything else but joy -

00:40:29.951 --> 00:40:36.510
then one has to know that he should give up all the myths

00:40:36.825 --> 00:40:38.742
with which he is living.

00:40:38.945 --> 00:40:40.845
All kinds of myths there are.

00:40:40.984 --> 00:40:42.928
Some people have myths, "We are very poor".

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:44.693
Some have myths, "We are very rich".

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:48.801
Some have this thing that, "We are very unhappy".

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:51.730
Some have that, "We are very happy".

00:40:51.909 --> 00:40:53.909
All kinds of myths these are.

00:40:54.587 --> 00:40:57.563
These are all myths.

00:40:58.357 --> 00:41:02.158
What is the thing is the complete emptiness;

00:41:02.714 --> 00:41:06.880
complete emptiness. That is joy.

00:41:07.992 --> 00:41:10.682
This emptiness is filled with joy.

00:41:11.119 --> 00:41:12.719
Complete emptiness.

00:41:12.964 --> 00:41:15.864
Then you don't expect anything from anyone.

00:41:16.087 --> 00:41:19.893
And this emptiness from within is actually,

00:41:20.072 --> 00:41:25.211
gives chance to compassion and love to enter into you.

00:41:25.568 --> 00:41:28.258
Supposing there is something in a pot already,

00:41:28.437 --> 00:41:30.237
what can you pour into it?

00:41:31.751 --> 00:41:33.551
What can you give into it?

00:41:34.251 --> 00:41:37.635
So if you are completely empty within,

00:41:37.933 --> 00:41:41.543
there's nothing of this nonsense of the past and the future:

00:41:41.683 --> 00:41:44.883
the aspirations, the ambitions, all those things,

00:41:45.722 --> 00:41:49.504
and falsehood. If you just become empty,

00:41:49.743 --> 00:41:53.544
it is filled in with nothing but joy,

00:41:53.743 --> 00:41:57.455
and joy of such a eternal nature. You never asked for it;

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:00.897
you do not look forward to it.

00:42:01.036 --> 00:42:03.868
It is there, all the time.

00:42:04.444 --> 00:42:09.305
And this is what I wish today you people can feel it.

00:42:09.762 --> 00:42:12.095
As you know, the Devi's things are

00:42:13.254 --> 00:42:16.110
so very deep and subtle:

00:42:17.023 --> 00:42:23.285
how She took the form of a Mother and how She looked after

00:42:23.623 --> 00:42:27.015
Her bhaktas with love;

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:30.269
how She fought demons

00:42:30.845 --> 00:42:32.525
and also negativity.

00:42:34.138 --> 00:42:37.899
But now the demons have entered into your hearts;

00:42:38.635 --> 00:42:41.771
these false gurus have entered into your brains.

00:42:42.404 --> 00:42:45.658
Through these horrible books so many things are coming,

00:42:45.796 --> 00:42:48.149
all the time attacking you.

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:52.149
Even if you kill those demons,

00:42:52.407 --> 00:42:55.462
still they'll be lingering in your heads.

00:42:55.749 --> 00:42:58.240
They should be actually killed when they,

00:42:58.419 --> 00:43:03.232
once they are reflected into your mind, have gone away.

00:43:03.848 --> 00:43:07.597
Then only it's possible to eliminate them.

00:43:07.776 --> 00:43:12.331
Otherwise they will go away but leave their bhoots into your heads.

00:43:12.828 --> 00:43:15.676
So these negativities, which come

00:43:15.973 --> 00:43:19.405
from wrong type of following you have had,

00:43:19.564 --> 00:43:21.549
from wrong books you have been reading,

00:43:21.694 --> 00:43:23.547
also in Sahaja Yoga when you come,

00:43:23.692 --> 00:43:26.892
you can be misled by some people - it's possible.

00:43:27.164 --> 00:43:30.767
In that case also, forgive that person.

00:43:31.065 --> 00:43:33.684
That person may improve, but you may continue

00:43:33.889 --> 00:43:37.921
with the same ideas and funny things and will suddenly come up.

00:43:41.721 --> 00:43:47.625
So the quality is of compassion and love,

00:43:48.378 --> 00:43:50.911
fearlessness and courage

00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:56.954
and the complete emptiness.

00:43:57.868 --> 00:44:02.046
In this emptiness, then, you are not worried about

00:44:02.344 --> 00:44:05.597
what you have to achieve, how many people

00:44:05.816 --> 00:44:07.613
you have to gather,

00:44:07.812 --> 00:44:11.482
how many must come to Sahaja Yoga - not bothered about that.

00:44:11.606 --> 00:44:15.561
Automatically it will work out, but you would not desire for it,

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.994
and you will not hanker, "Oh my God!"

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:21.495
say, "There is not many people, what to do?" this, that.

00:44:21.645 --> 00:44:23.487
It is good for us in a way,

00:44:23.686 --> 00:44:27.718
because where is the place in heaven for so many stupid people?

00:44:29.459 --> 00:44:35.463
So we should not run after people who are negative and useless.

00:44:36.494 --> 00:44:40.839
But we must definitely take over the people

00:44:41.039 --> 00:44:44.352
who are genuinely good.

00:44:44.718 --> 00:44:47.031
One thing more I would like to tell you,

00:44:47.269 --> 00:44:51.090
that automatically such people are dropped out in Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:51.309 --> 00:44:54.820
In one shot they will go away.

00:44:55.158 --> 00:44:58.372
They don't stay, because they don't deserve to be there.

00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:01.558
They don't deserve to have the Mother's powers.

00:45:01.738 --> 00:45:06.797
So this happens in a very beautiful, subtle manner.

00:45:06.995 --> 00:45:11.451
And I see, I go late always to any program,

00:45:11.908 --> 00:45:15.392
so those who are useless just disappear.

00:45:15.709 --> 00:45:18.856
And some of them disappear half-way through,

00:45:19.073 --> 00:45:21.582
because nothing goes into their head, really,

00:45:21.781 --> 00:45:24.917
they don't understand anything, so they go away.

00:45:25.411 --> 00:45:29.315
So now the ones which are left are the real seekers of truth

00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:32.517
and they get, all of them, Realization.

00:45:32.736 --> 00:45:34.891
In Sanskrit, they call it 'shayen'

00:45:35.049 --> 00:45:39.593
- means 'selection'. This is a natural selection that takes place,

00:45:39.791 --> 00:45:45.287
and how people go away and how they come back

00:45:45.664 --> 00:45:48.751
to Sahaja Yoga, it's very interesting.

00:45:50.557 --> 00:45:54.644
This is a common happening in Sahaja Yoga, you know.

00:45:54.823 --> 00:45:56.322
You should not get upset.

00:45:56.462 --> 00:45:59.598
Now if you get too many people, say from Russia,

00:45:59.874 --> 00:46:01.751
and not so much from Switzerland,

00:46:01.871 --> 00:46:05.751
maybe you might think that way; but now it's not that bad.

00:46:07.815 --> 00:46:13.549
Then we should not worry, because we are no more Russians or Swiss.

00:46:14.343 --> 00:46:19.819
We are superhuman beings, we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:46:20.181 --> 00:46:23.764
Whether they are Russians or whether they are Indians

00:46:23.905 --> 00:46:26.772
or from some African land, it's all right.

00:46:28.409 --> 00:46:31.865
As long as they are Sahaja Yogis, we should be happy.

00:46:32.911 --> 00:46:36.971
If the Swiss are coming to Sahaja Yoga, we should be happy.

00:46:37.142 --> 00:46:39.142
So this attachment, in a way,

00:46:39.281 --> 00:46:42.439
is good to begin with, that you want to bring more Swiss,

00:46:42.686 --> 00:46:44.424
because you want to have company.

00:46:44.583 --> 00:46:49.067
Now you can't live with one person in a jungle,

00:46:49.364 --> 00:46:52.352
with all the others non-Sahaja Yogis, you see

00:46:52.551 --> 00:46:54.646
- difficult. So you want to have company.

00:46:54.775 --> 00:46:57.315
So you want to have more and more and more.

00:46:57.435 --> 00:46:58.644
But doesn't matter.

00:46:58.824 --> 00:47:01.024
As many as there are sufficient,

00:47:01.304 --> 00:47:04.760
and we shouldn't worry about those things, the number.

00:47:05.313 --> 00:47:08.777
But when we want to share our love,

00:47:09.035 --> 00:47:12.864
then we do feel the dearth. Not because we are Swiss,

00:47:13.003 --> 00:47:15.237
but because we cannot share.

00:47:15.436 --> 00:47:19.316
That time a new personality rises,

00:47:19.674 --> 00:47:24.773
and this new personality is the one which works.

00:47:25.367 --> 00:47:27.918
I mean we are not giving you any money;

00:47:28.078 --> 00:47:30.012
there are no awards for you.

00:47:30.221 --> 00:47:33.087
There's no way there's much encouragement,

00:47:33.257 --> 00:47:36.364
like we have your sort of a picture hanging here,

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:38.070
nothing of the kind.

00:47:38.229 --> 00:47:41.146
Can you imagine in any organization

00:47:41.265 --> 00:47:44.638
anybody would work like this, the way you work? Nobody would.

00:47:44.817 --> 00:47:48.578
They give you awards, they give you bonuses,

00:47:49.491 --> 00:47:52.070
also they give you promotions;

00:47:52.249 --> 00:47:55.892
they do all kinds of things, you see, to keep you going.

00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:58.721
But we don't do anything in Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:59.337 --> 00:48:02.345
So what makes you work so hard in Sahaja Yoga,

00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:05.023
what makes you spread Sahaja Yoga?

00:48:05.785 --> 00:48:08.318
Only thing is that you want to share.

00:48:09.526 --> 00:48:10.953
You can't help it,

00:48:11.152 --> 00:48:13.152
it's like a drunkard you see.

00:48:13.316 --> 00:48:14.923
If he has a bottle,

00:48:15.042 --> 00:48:18.306
he must have at least one person to share with him,

00:48:18.773 --> 00:48:25.677
because he thinks that it would be sinful,

00:48:25.861 --> 00:48:28.927
"As it is I am doing sin, why not share with somebody else?"

00:48:29.027 --> 00:48:31.294
So it would be half-half divided.

00:48:40.889 --> 00:48:49.313
But in Sahaja Yoga you share it; you want to spread it.

00:48:49.869 --> 00:48:53.948
It is because you are collective;

00:48:54.405 --> 00:48:57.072
you have become collective, that's why.

00:48:57.897 --> 00:49:01.905
You want more to come in, more to join, to enjoy.

00:49:02.123 --> 00:49:04.931
You become a very noble person, you see?

00:49:05.111 --> 00:49:07.067
Like, of course drunkards do that,

00:49:07.249 --> 00:49:11.098
but supposing somebody has a lottery, or some,

00:49:11.277 --> 00:49:14.840
he gets a very big business, he won't like to share.

00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:20.792
But you think that, "Why not? If I am so much enjoying,

00:49:20.971 --> 00:49:22.251
why not others?

00:49:23.553 --> 00:49:27.712
Why not people have the same bliss as I have?"

00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:32.029
So because you become extremely noble, so noble,

00:49:32.149 --> 00:49:36.712
you work so hard, so very hard to achieve it.

00:49:37.347 --> 00:49:40.810
I mean, no words can describe My joy

00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:45.295
when I see you people working it so spontaneously.

00:49:45.514 --> 00:49:49.414
Yesterday I saw the film, the whole drama,

00:49:49.573 --> 00:49:55.466
and I was really very much amazed and touched

00:49:55.863 --> 00:50:02.700
that this Marathi music has come to Cabella.

00:50:03.811 --> 00:50:08.374
Can you imagine any Italian thinking of it?

00:50:09.129 --> 00:50:12.426
Even hundred years to come he would not think.

00:50:12.705 --> 00:50:17.171
how it has come so spontaneously and is working out?

00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:20.941
Because there is a sense of collectivity.

00:50:22.429 --> 00:50:25.822
The 'New Age' people talk of is here, no doubt.

00:50:25.993 --> 00:50:30.727
This is the New Age, and new consciousness is also there.

00:50:31.025 --> 00:50:34.225
But what is the 'new' now is the new collectivity,

00:50:35.072 --> 00:50:38.981
and that collectivity acts, that you want to spread:

00:50:39.159 --> 00:50:44.913
it acts, like your hunger, it is another kind of hunger,

00:50:45.222 --> 00:50:48.031
that you want to create more Sahaja Yogis,

00:50:48.191 --> 00:50:50.702
you want to have more brothers and sisters,

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.690
and you want to help them so that they could come to the Pujas

00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:57.696
and all that and become good Sahaja Yogis.

00:50:57.845 --> 00:51:03.591
Now this kind of an ambition or a joy or whatever you may call it,

00:51:03.730 --> 00:51:07.500
is the whole plan, shows that in your heart,

00:51:07.758 --> 00:51:10.686
the collectivity is prospering.

00:51:11.322 --> 00:51:15.151
And that's why you cannot enjoy Sahaja Yoga alone,

00:51:15.369 --> 00:51:17.369
sitting in the Himalayas -no.

00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:19.697
You want to have other people.

00:51:20.052 --> 00:51:25.421
This is now the sign of how the Mother's love has taken roots

00:51:25.590 --> 00:51:30.837
in your hearts and how you are all going to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:32.445 --> 00:51:37.257
Of course I'm told that somebody in Australia making money

00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:39.738
- Australia has been always a problem -

00:51:39.937 --> 00:51:42.270
they are making money out of this;

00:51:42.366 --> 00:51:44.445
so I just don't know what to say,

00:51:44.608 --> 00:51:47.270
because this is, I can't understand.

00:51:47.429 --> 00:51:51.548
How can they think of making money or doing all kinds of things,

00:51:51.687 --> 00:51:56.706
and doing all kinds of asahaj things?

00:51:59.584 --> 00:52:03.464
Some sort of a headache comes up, doesn't matter.

00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:06.193
Leave it to Me. I'll manage it,

00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:11.520
whatever it is; but you just become great lights of your Mother.

00:52:11.877 --> 00:52:14.905
That's what I have to request you tonight.

00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:19.865
You have all the power flowing in you,

00:52:20.024 --> 00:52:24.242
you have the light which is enlightened,

00:52:24.401 --> 00:52:26.583
but you must expand.

00:52:27.794 --> 00:52:30.345
Expand it more and more and more,

00:52:30.604 --> 00:52:33.758
and you will be surprised what Tukarama has said,

00:52:34.036 --> 00:52:37.607
that, "I am like a small little particle of dust,

00:52:37.885 --> 00:52:40.806
and also I am the whole sky".

00:52:43.901 --> 00:52:48.584
This is what is your personality.

00:52:48.901 --> 00:52:51.380
May God bless you all.
