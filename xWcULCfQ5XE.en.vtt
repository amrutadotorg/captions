00:12:39.571 --> 00:12:46.425
For the last so many lectures, we have been saying

00:12:47.503 --> 00:12:50.639
that you cannot pay for God’s love.

00:12:50.639 --> 00:12:55.395
It makes me laugh sometimes.

00:12:56.371 --> 00:13:01.371
Human beings can never understand his love,

00:13:01.503 --> 00:13:05.223
because they live in a very limited sphere.

00:13:05.223 --> 00:13:09.154
His love is unlimited. His forgiveness is unlimited.

00:13:09.154 --> 00:13:16.916
Even this word “unlimited” and “infinite”, we do not understand

00:13:17.011 --> 00:13:20.811
because we have not known anything like that.

00:13:20.811 --> 00:13:22.931
And to say that something is genuine

00:13:23.451 --> 00:13:25.971
is also like certifying something that is genuine.

00:13:26.451 --> 00:13:28.303
You don’t need a certificate.

00:13:28.371 --> 00:13:31.546
Even that human beings don't understand.

00:13:32.891 --> 00:13:37.871
We live with artificiality,

00:13:38.491 --> 00:13:41.731
we try to find the truth,

00:13:41.731 --> 00:13:44.771
again we accept artificiality as truth.

00:13:45.331 --> 00:13:47.263
Again we go on fighting.

00:13:47.371 --> 00:13:49.851
Then we think this is the truth.

00:13:50.611 --> 00:13:53.277
Again that turns out to be something, artificial thing

00:13:53.277 --> 00:13:56.521
or some sort of a mental projection.

00:13:56.811 --> 00:14:04.114
All these limited endeavours of human beings

00:14:04.114 --> 00:14:07.703
and the experiences they have,

00:14:07.811 --> 00:14:12.451
made him so conditioned,

00:14:12.451 --> 00:14:18.250
that it is not easy to understand God.

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:24.347
He made all this universe in his compassion and love.

00:14:24.347 --> 00:14:28.235
He created you as human beings, also in his compassion and love.

00:14:28.235 --> 00:14:29.995
He doesn’t need anything.

00:14:30.571 --> 00:14:32.611
But he loves.

00:14:33.531 --> 00:14:40.361
And you can’t understand a person who loves beyond any reason,

00:14:40.651 --> 00:14:47.642
without any reward, just love because for love’s sake.

00:14:47.891 --> 00:14:55.491
We can’t think of one human being like that, who can love only for love’s sake.

00:14:55.491 --> 00:15:00.660
Only after Realization, as you grow more and more,

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:06.880
you realise that loving is the greatest joy.

00:15:07.903 --> 00:15:11.371
And then, you cannot think of money in relation to him.

00:15:11.571 --> 00:15:15.851
It's something, you'll say but, I think,

00:15:16.451 --> 00:15:20.743
even to say this, "We don't need money or we don't take money"

00:15:20.743 --> 00:15:25.345
itself is so low level.

00:15:25.771 --> 00:15:30.303
It's so, so much gross.

00:15:31.451 --> 00:15:37.969
Because money and all these concepts are your own.

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:43.377
He didn't make this world to get any fruits out of it.

00:15:43.691 --> 00:15:45.331
Nothing.

00:15:45.731 --> 00:15:47.851
He just made it because he loved.

00:15:48.331 --> 00:15:49.531
He wanted to express His Love.

00:15:49.731 --> 00:15:53.182
Just to manifest that Love, he made this world.

00:15:53.451 --> 00:15:55.371
There’s nothing else expected

00:15:55.571 --> 00:16:00.651
and to put the human mind at that level is an impossibility, I find, in the beginning.

00:16:00.651 --> 00:16:05.411
But gradually they start understanding how forgiving he is,

00:16:05.411 --> 00:16:08.771
how kind he is, how nice he is.

00:16:08.771 --> 00:16:12.451
So the first problem I have to face in the West always

00:16:12.451 --> 00:16:16.571
even in Paris this was the problem that I faced

00:16:16.571 --> 00:16:21.808
was that human beings feel guilty.

00:16:22.371 --> 00:16:25.451
And this guilt is such a big problem in the West,

00:16:25.651 --> 00:16:27.451
I just don't understand.

00:16:27.691 --> 00:16:29.451
You see, why do you feel guilty so much,

00:16:29.651 --> 00:16:32.571
as that is one of the hurdles of Sahaja Yoga, I've seen,

00:16:32.771 --> 00:16:34.651
that people start feeling guilty.

00:16:34.851 --> 00:16:36.411
To such an extent,

00:16:36.611 --> 00:16:39.691
that they don't believe that they can get Realization.

00:16:40.371 --> 00:16:43.451
They think they are sinners born outright,

00:16:43.691 --> 00:16:46.851
permanently, branded as 'sinners',

00:16:47.651 --> 00:16:50.331
and they can never take their Realization.

00:16:50.531 --> 00:16:52.491
I mean, just they brand themselves.

00:16:52.771 --> 00:16:54.411
It's beyond self pity also,

00:16:54.611 --> 00:16:58.771
I would say it's even self-destructive.

00:16:58.771 --> 00:17:02.371
Today, I've taken up this subject of Left Vishuddhi,

00:17:02.571 --> 00:17:06.611
because I felt that I must one day speak on this subject,

00:17:06.811 --> 00:17:09.531
that this is absolutely,

00:17:10.851 --> 00:17:17.619
not inteligible to God that you are guilty. For what?

00:17:18.851 --> 00:17:21.651
Guilty for what are you?

00:17:21.851 --> 00:17:24.651
If you ask yourself, you'll say, "Oh, we are guilty,

00:17:24.851 --> 00:17:27.451
because we've crucified Christ" at the most.

00:17:27.651 --> 00:17:31.371
That is the maximum guilt a human being, let's say, on his head.

00:17:31.571 --> 00:17:39.231
"We crucified Christ, we tortured all the saints". All right.

00:17:39.891 --> 00:17:43.851
But by being guilty what do you get?

00:17:43.851 --> 00:17:47.651
Do you get Him back, can you go back and correct that situation?

00:17:47.851 --> 00:17:50.451
You cannot.

00:17:50.451 --> 00:17:54.651
But harping upon that, you do get into your subconscious mind.

00:17:54.651 --> 00:18:02.295
You get into a position where you are no more normal to receive the Love of God.

00:18:02.571 --> 00:18:05.531
You recede into a corner of your mind,

00:18:05.731 --> 00:18:07.451
which is darkness,

00:18:07.651 --> 00:18:09.851
which is ignorant, which is blindness,

00:18:10.691 --> 00:18:13.851
where you cannot receive that beautiful reign,

00:18:14.771 --> 00:18:21.250
that eternal flow that's coming in.

00:18:21.691 --> 00:18:24.331
You hide yourself, at the back,

00:18:24.531 --> 00:18:26.291
and then you say,

00:18:26.491 --> 00:18:27.851
"What about the sun?

00:18:28.491 --> 00:18:33.912
I cannot receive it because I don't deserve it."

00:18:35.451 --> 00:18:38.698
Behind all this ego orientation in the West -

00:18:38.698 --> 00:18:43.771
Oh, I think, I wish they were purely egoistical. They are not.

00:18:43.771 --> 00:18:50.607
All this ego recedes bac ,into that little pouch, what we call the 'guilt'.

00:18:51.651 --> 00:18:54.491
You say something to someone.

00:18:54.491 --> 00:18:56.891
It's saying that point, that stage,

00:18:57.371 --> 00:19:01.153
that, "I've said it. All right, I've said it. I can take the responsability, i's good."

00:19:01.153 --> 00:19:02.531
Not that.

00:19:02.531 --> 00:19:07.611
But you come back home, "Oh, I should not have said that".

00:19:07.611 --> 00:19:13.100
So you wobble between one kind of action into another kind,

00:19:13.371 --> 00:19:15.971
from say, into an aggressive

00:19:16.451 --> 00:19:19.731
to another one of a receding type

00:19:19.731 --> 00:19:21.851
And this wobbling really,

00:19:22.531 --> 00:19:24.611
is very, very troublesome.

00:19:24.811 --> 00:19:26.691
It can go on too much.

00:19:26.891 --> 00:19:29.371
The oscilation could be so much.

00:19:29.611 --> 00:19:32.571
that it can make you absolutely frantic,

00:19:32.771 --> 00:19:38.909
diffident, and sometimes, useless.

00:19:41.451 --> 00:19:43.371
On the contrary,

00:19:43.771 --> 00:19:45.771
God wants to find human beings,

00:19:46.331 --> 00:19:47.611
who are cheerful people,

00:19:47.811 --> 00:19:49.571
who are happy people,

00:19:49.771 --> 00:19:52.371
who are thankful to Him for His blessings.

00:19:54.771 --> 00:19:57.931
The most unhappy animal in this world,

00:19:58.411 --> 00:20:01.277
is the human being, can you believe that?

00:20:01.851 --> 00:20:05.691
Animals, don't know happiness and unhappiness, also a good point is.

00:20:07.811 --> 00:20:09.771
But the most unhappy human being,

00:20:09.971 --> 00:20:12.571
and the most complicated human being,

00:20:13.451 --> 00:20:16.531
has become so over you see, self-destructive,

00:20:16.531 --> 00:20:19.627
that a destruction force is built within himself.

00:20:21.503 --> 00:20:26.936
Now think of that force that has built you up into a human

00:20:27.451 --> 00:20:29.571
how with care and love,

00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:32.571
without your knowledge, without troubling you.

00:20:32.771 --> 00:20:35.611
Even when you were born you never knew what was the pain,

00:20:35.811 --> 00:20:38.771
of the birth. Your mother took over it.

00:20:38.771 --> 00:20:41.491
He's made you a human being

00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:46.688
so carefully, delicately he's built you up.

00:20:47.531 --> 00:20:48.851
For what?

00:20:49.491 --> 00:20:53.829
What is the fruit of this beautiful flower?

00:20:54.851 --> 00:20:56.651
Why the flower starts hitting itself?

00:20:56.851 --> 00:20:59.981
Have you ever heard of anyone like that?

00:21:01.771 --> 00:21:04.331
This is the worst disease, which

00:21:04.851 --> 00:21:07.931
we in the West suffer.

00:21:09.611 --> 00:21:11.571
French yes,

00:21:11.851 --> 00:21:13.731
we had at least double the number of people

00:21:13.931 --> 00:21:15.771
that we have here today, surprisingly.

00:21:15.971 --> 00:21:18.491
But, also they have the same problem.

00:21:18.691 --> 00:21:21.811
And I think all their psychologists,

00:21:23.011 --> 00:21:25.011
psychoanalists,

00:21:25.771 --> 00:21:28.931
or we can say the, all the books,

00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:31.531
all the writers, the philosophers,

00:21:31.731 --> 00:21:35.719
everyone has done to them.

00:21:36.491 --> 00:21:38.851
They have given these ideas,

00:21:39.491 --> 00:21:41.651
and everybody accepts them.

00:21:42.411 --> 00:21:45.611
And they curse themselves morning till evening,

00:21:46.491 --> 00:21:49.371
walking with so many wrinkles on the forehead.

00:21:49.971 --> 00:21:51.651
When you ask them, they will say,

00:21:51.851 --> 00:21:54.411
"Mother we are very unhappy people".

00:21:54.771 --> 00:22:01.794
It's like asking unhappiness to come and decorate you.

00:22:02.851 --> 00:22:10.982
But it has a subtler meaning of which people are not aware.

00:22:11.811 --> 00:22:13.851
These are the times,

00:22:14.851 --> 00:22:17.611
when you have to get your Realization.

00:22:17.851 --> 00:22:20.331
This mass Realization has to work out.

00:22:20.531 --> 00:22:22.371
It's all prophesized,

00:22:22.651 --> 00:22:25.457
and very important times are these.

00:22:25.931 --> 00:22:28.691
All the stars are acting to help us.

00:22:29.531 --> 00:22:31.691
The whole universe is helping us.

00:22:32.851 --> 00:22:34.971
All the elements are helping us.

00:22:35.491 --> 00:22:38.580
We are on the stage.

00:22:39.771 --> 00:22:42.371
But when the actors arrive on the stage,

00:22:42.371 --> 00:22:44.451
they are finished, they can't act.

00:22:44.691 --> 00:22:47.451
They can't do anything, they can't play their game.

00:22:47.771 --> 00:22:51.491
They are so involved with their different roles.

00:22:54.731 --> 00:22:57.771
And that is why one has to understand the subtler effect of it,

00:22:57.971 --> 00:23:00.331
then only you will get rid of this guilt.

00:23:00.531 --> 00:23:04.820
You are playing into the hands of negative forces.

00:23:05.571 --> 00:23:11.571
They are not less than any atomic bombs,

00:23:11.571 --> 00:23:13.411
built within yourselves.

00:23:14.451 --> 00:23:15.971
Now what is the way it works out,

00:23:16.411 --> 00:23:18.291
I think people do not realize it.

00:23:18.491 --> 00:23:20.611
It's a very subtle method.

00:23:20.851 --> 00:23:22.451
Let's see the atomic bomb,

00:23:22.651 --> 00:23:26.699
hidrogen bomb, what will you do there?

00:23:27.851 --> 00:23:30.851
They will separate something which should not be separated.

00:23:33.651 --> 00:23:38.691
We break atom, which is not divisible,

00:23:38.691 --> 00:23:41.136
into its divisible parts.

00:23:41.731 --> 00:23:47.971
So we put a pressure to break them.

00:23:47.971 --> 00:23:50.451
And when that breaking force,

00:23:50.651 --> 00:23:52.491
that aggression I would say,

00:23:52.691 --> 00:23:54.691
is worked out,

00:23:56.011 --> 00:23:59.611
that becomes another destructive force.

00:24:01.491 --> 00:24:04.531
So whatever effort we have put into that,

00:24:04.771 --> 00:24:07.971
multiplies, it's not the same force.

00:24:09.851 --> 00:24:13.637
And that we use for our destruction.

00:24:13.637 --> 00:24:18.665
I mean, this only human being can do,
to create things to destroy himself.

00:24:19.371 --> 00:24:22.651
But this force, which works within our minds,

00:24:22.851 --> 00:24:24.731
within ourselves, within our being,

00:24:24.931 --> 00:24:28.691
where we actually really hate ourselves sometimes I feel,

00:24:28.891 --> 00:24:31.371
the way we are destroying ourselves,

00:24:32.571 --> 00:24:33.971
this force

00:24:34.571 --> 00:24:36.931
we build within ourselves thanks to  many

00:24:37.331 --> 00:24:39.611
nonsensical writers and conditioners

00:24:39.811 --> 00:24:44.178
and people who talk of conditioning really condition you much worse!

00:24:44.571 --> 00:24:46.931
You should be singing and chanting like a bird.

00:24:47.931 --> 00:24:50.731
You should be laughing and enjoying like a flower.

00:24:51.611 --> 00:24:53.611
But I find human beings faces,

00:24:53.811 --> 00:24:56.731
all, looking so very unhappy.

00:24:57.851 --> 00:24:59.731
What's the reason?

00:25:00.371 --> 00:25:06.085
The reason is you are separated from your own being,

00:25:06.771 --> 00:25:11.651
the being that integrates you. You are completely disintegrated.

00:25:11.651 --> 00:25:18.651
When you disintegrate the hidrogen atom

00:25:18.651 --> 00:25:21.611
you form a very big force built into it.

00:25:21.931 --> 00:25:27.891
In the same way, you are the disintegrating your being:

00:25:27.891 --> 00:25:31.651
your physical being on one side, your mental being on another side,

00:25:31.851 --> 00:25:37.125
your spiritual being on another side, there's no integrating point.

00:25:37.731 --> 00:25:42.113
And when you cannot feel that integration,

00:25:42.371 --> 00:25:43.691
you feel guilty,

00:25:43.891 --> 00:25:46.571
but that guilt is just a symptom of

00:25:46.771 --> 00:25:51.503
a very big destructive force built in you.

00:25:52.851 --> 00:25:59.143
This is the way we are going to destroy ourselves.

00:25:59.771 --> 00:26:01.451
No other way.

00:26:01.651 --> 00:26:04.331
Our destruction is not going to come to us from outside.

00:26:04.531 --> 00:26:06.411
That can be controlled.

00:26:07.371 --> 00:26:12.780
It's going to come from within, within ourselves.

00:26:13.611 --> 00:26:16.851
Everything we do now, after disintegration,

00:26:17.611 --> 00:26:26.292
is further disintegration
or further building up that negative force within us.

00:26:28.011 --> 00:26:32.242
But to integrate it,

00:26:32.811 --> 00:26:36.851
to make you feel complete integration with all your being,

00:26:38.411 --> 00:26:40.571
it's only possible

00:26:41.331 --> 00:26:43.011
if you can somehow or other

00:26:43.451 --> 00:26:45.371
get to that integrating force

00:26:45.571 --> 00:26:51.503
which is still there and is quite deep.

00:26:54.851 --> 00:26:58.731
That's the last chance, I would say now, that has to work.

00:26:58.931 --> 00:27:01.931
The way the negative forces have set in motion

00:27:02.571 --> 00:27:05.651
of which you may not be aware at all, you may not be aware,

00:27:05.851 --> 00:27:09.851
you don't know what darkness is there.

00:27:11.531 --> 00:27:16.411
And to fight it, what one has to do

00:27:16.571 --> 00:27:22.311
is to bring that light of the Spirit,
which integrates.

00:27:22.891 --> 00:27:24.851
Darkness always disintegrates you.

00:27:25.411 --> 00:27:27.731
For example, there's complete darkness, all right,

00:27:27.931 --> 00:27:30.931
I can't feel you, I don't know who you are, where you are sitting.

00:27:31.491 --> 00:27:32.771
We are all separate.

00:27:32.971 --> 00:27:36.391
I can't see you, I don't know who you people are there.

00:27:36.531 --> 00:27:39.371
I wouldn't know where is the window, where is the door.

00:27:39.931 --> 00:27:42.571
I'll hold this and say, "This is the truth".

00:27:43.811 --> 00:27:47.751
All disintegrated personalities,
and disintegrated people,

00:27:48.411 --> 00:27:50.771
always see aberrations. They see different things,

00:27:50.971 --> 00:27:52.851
different auras, different things.

00:27:55.971 --> 00:27:59.971
Now, it's a very vicious circle.
You just think of it.

00:28:00.651 --> 00:28:05.351
It's a very great vicious circle we have.

00:28:05.851 --> 00:28:14.891
The vicious circle is that we try to think about it,

00:28:14.891 --> 00:28:16.651
which is limited.

00:28:16.851 --> 00:28:19.891
Supposing I have a limited vision, there's darkness

00:28:20.531 --> 00:28:23.262
what will I feel?

00:28:24.411 --> 00:28:28.891
You start thinking about it and thinking about it,
pondering over it.

00:28:28.971 --> 00:28:34.758
The more you think about it, the worse it becomes.

00:28:37.611 --> 00:28:41.371
Another way could be people may try to solve this problem,

00:28:41.771 --> 00:28:44.391
to think that we are disintegrated,

00:28:44.571 --> 00:28:48.891
is to talk of big things, "We are all brothers and sisters,

00:28:48.931 --> 00:28:51.451
let's form U.N. counseling,

00:28:51.931 --> 00:28:55.611
let's do world organization".

00:28:55.851 --> 00:28:59.291
All blind people doing world organization will end up

00:28:59.491 --> 00:29:07.026
at the most, as a labour, what you call, labour department.

00:29:07.026 --> 00:29:09.371
That's all.

00:29:09.891 --> 00:29:16.931
With all these institutions
working in the big name,

00:29:17.931 --> 00:29:19.571
where are we?

00:29:20.011 --> 00:29:27.011
Actually, when we become aware, we don't need them.

00:29:27.011 --> 00:29:30.282
We don't need at all.

00:29:31.491 --> 00:29:34.411
So, this awareness is nothing but

00:29:34.611 --> 00:29:38.883
the light of the Spirit within you which is missing.

00:29:39.411 --> 00:29:41.571
The Spirit is watching you, all right.

00:29:41.771 --> 00:29:43.411
It goes up to a point

00:29:43.611 --> 00:29:48.371
to see your stupidity and your limitedness.

00:29:49.691 --> 00:29:55.411
And it goes up to a very great extent, I should say,
where it's finished.

00:29:55.531 --> 00:29:58.651
It disappears and a person dies,

00:29:58.931 --> 00:30:01.691
or he gets into trouble, he becomes creazy, mad,

00:30:01.891 --> 00:30:03.331
whatever you may call him.

00:30:03.531 --> 00:30:09.391
He develops other diseases like cancer,

00:30:09.531 --> 00:30:15.411
which are caused by another problem here,
as you know, Ekadesha.

00:30:16.011 --> 00:30:24.398
So, these forces are built within us, of negativity,

00:30:24.398 --> 00:30:29.345
when we go to the extremes of negativity.

00:30:29.891 --> 00:30:32.011
So, in the Kundalini shastra,

00:30:32.491 --> 00:30:38.336
we can say that the left and right side
when used too much,

00:30:39.451 --> 00:30:45.771
you build up these forces in the head of eleven Rudras,
the eleven distructive forces.

00:30:45.771 --> 00:30:48.571
A cancer patient develops it.

00:30:48.771 --> 00:30:52.651
But even before developing cancer,
people can develop it.

00:30:52.931 --> 00:30:59.491
And there are so many things,
that can create this,

00:30:59.851 --> 00:31:03.531
that sometimes one would feel,
in this vicious circle

00:31:03.731 --> 00:31:07.980
that, "How are you going to patch up the whole society?"

00:31:08.371 --> 00:31:16.691
And there's only one thing,
that will save the situation, it's Self-realization.

00:31:18.731 --> 00:31:27.851
All other things are destroying, are absolutely confusing.

00:31:28.371 --> 00:31:31.940
But there's only one thing if you can do,

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:37.030
it saves the whole thing, like putting on the light, finished!

00:31:38.371 --> 00:31:43.731
But people don't understand the importance of Self-realization,

00:31:43.731 --> 00:31:48.563
because some people ask me, "What's the use of getting the cool breeze in the hand?"

00:31:48.931 --> 00:31:52.491
Now, see the big canvas of the whole thing, the whole cosmos,

00:31:52.491 --> 00:31:54.537
in a jeopardy.

00:31:54.537 --> 00:31:58.531
See what's happening to human beings today.

00:31:58.531 --> 00:32:03.811
And if they are to be saved, no use being unhappy.

00:32:03.811 --> 00:32:08.731
Like in France they said, "You cannot, Mother, say you are very happy person".

00:32:08.731 --> 00:32:10.516
I said, "Why?"

00:32:10.516 --> 00:32:17.152
"Because that means you are ignorant of the shocks."

00:32:17.531 --> 00:32:20.331
You see, I have to say  "I am very unhappy", you see.

00:32:20.531 --> 00:32:22.611
I have to paint some lines here to show you,

00:32:22.811 --> 00:32:25.291
that I'm very deeply concerned,

00:32:25.491 --> 00:32:29.371
worried about the whole world.

00:32:29.371 --> 00:32:31.851
But what is the solution have you got?

00:32:32.851 --> 00:32:35.411
You want me to be like you only?

00:32:35.771 --> 00:32:37.451
Is that the solution?

00:32:37.451 --> 00:32:40.491
That if ten people are weeping you also join them weeping?

00:32:40.691 --> 00:32:44.066
Is that the solution?

00:32:45.691 --> 00:32:51.971
And the one and only method that we have

00:32:52.931 --> 00:32:56.371
which has been already told and prescribed

00:32:56.451 --> 00:32:59.851
and has been prophesized,

00:33:00.931 --> 00:33:04.571
nobody seeks it.
No one seeks it.

00:33:04.931 --> 00:33:07.451
See now, in the Bible: you have to be born again,

00:33:07.651 --> 00:33:09.491
Christ is to be born in your heart.

00:33:09.691 --> 00:33:12.011
I mean, they do it, even before solving the whole drama

00:33:12.451 --> 00:33:14.571
they do it by giving you the second birth,

00:33:14.771 --> 00:33:17.371
by Christening you, so called.

00:33:18.611 --> 00:33:21.491
Hindus they believe without yoga is there's no sense.

00:33:21.691 --> 00:33:24.411
"Yoga kshema vahamyam" Krishna said all the time that,

00:33:24.611 --> 00:33:25.691
"You seek yoga". What are you seeking?

00:33:25.891 --> 00:33:27.891
All these treatises and all these big books

00:33:28.331 --> 00:33:31.331
and all the scriptures are aiming at what?

00:33:31.651 --> 00:33:35.661
Even, those who talked, "You must live with dharma
you must live a balanced life"

00:33:35.661 --> 00:33:38.411
For what? Why do you do it?

00:33:38.851 --> 00:33:40.371
What is the destination?

00:33:40.691 --> 00:33:43.851
And the destination is the Spirit.

00:33:44.611 --> 00:33:51.551
And today the background is so black,
is so dark,

00:33:51.651 --> 00:33:58.351
that this solution is
the end of everything.

00:33:58.771 --> 00:34:02.331
But do we realize this?

00:34:02.851 --> 00:34:07.811
On the contrary, the vicious circle builts in, within us,
all the time.

00:34:07.851 --> 00:34:11.851
"Oh, see how the world is miserable.

00:34:11.851 --> 00:34:14.860
Then how can I be happy?

00:34:16.811 --> 00:34:18.611
I'm so unhappy in life."

00:34:18.811 --> 00:34:21.503
I have yet to come across a person before Realization

00:34:21.503 --> 00:34:24.223
saying that, "I am a happy person".

00:34:25.851 --> 00:34:29.916
Maybe ego-oriented people might say, "I'm happy",
meaning "my ego is".

00:34:29.916 --> 00:34:32.748
You see, if he goes in a swanky car, or something like that,

00:34:32.748 --> 00:34:35.491
he's very happy, on top of the world.

00:34:35.651 --> 00:34:40.311
After ten minutes, you see him [looking sad]

00:34:40.811 --> 00:34:43.371
and this vicious circle is set in.

00:34:43.571 --> 00:34:47.351
This ego-oriented circle, or another one, it sets in.

00:34:47.531 --> 00:34:50.291
Another vicious circle and another vicious circle

00:34:50.491 --> 00:34:52.803
and another vicious circle,

00:34:52.811 --> 00:34:54.851
we go on from one to another,

00:34:54.851 --> 00:34:58.580
moving on the wheels after wheels,

00:34:59.531 --> 00:35:06.531
without realizing that, "Where we are going?"

00:35:08.571 --> 00:35:15.391
And this vicious circle has to be broken by one faith,

00:35:15.391 --> 00:35:21.811
by one understanding, that God is forgiveness.

00:35:21.811 --> 00:35:25.748
God is Love.

00:35:26.851 --> 00:35:31.371
When we feel love for anyone, without any lust and greed,

00:35:31.371 --> 00:35:35.751
then that is God’s love within us.

00:35:36.691 --> 00:35:43.344
That he is the embodiment of that pure love,

00:35:43.851 --> 00:35:47.651
which just loves,

00:35:47.651 --> 00:35:50.559
which has given you this beautiful human life

00:35:50.559 --> 00:35:54.388
and wants to make you more beautiful.

00:35:55.371 --> 00:35:57.811
He created all this creation for you

00:35:58.371 --> 00:36:03.083
and that he wants you to enjoy the bounties of this creation.

00:36:03.491 --> 00:36:06.331
He wants you to enjoy the citizen of his realm

00:36:06.531 --> 00:36:11.570
and the Kingdom of his Grace.

00:36:13.771 --> 00:36:16.451
Do we go to see someone

00:36:16.451 --> 00:36:19.851
who is highly placed, with a morose face? Do we?

00:36:20.651 --> 00:36:22.811
That day, we'll specially brush up the hair,

00:36:23.011 --> 00:36:25.411
see, make our hair into a beautiful thing,

00:36:25.611 --> 00:36:28.524
make our face nice, dress up well,

00:36:28.524 --> 00:36:30.880
It looks like we are well, you see.

00:36:31.851 --> 00:36:33.851
That’s outside.

00:36:35.811 --> 00:36:40.943
Inside, if you just feel how kind he is,

00:36:42.691 --> 00:36:47.256
how he has worked out meticulously

00:36:47.256 --> 00:36:50.256
in this blissful life of a human being.

00:36:50.531 --> 00:36:54.258
But think how much he has done for you!

00:36:54.531 --> 00:36:56.651
Instead of that, if you are all the time going to say,

00:36:56.851 --> 00:36:58.971
“I am very unhappy in life.”

00:36:59.411 --> 00:37:01.611
I mean, think of someone who does everything for you

00:37:01.811 --> 00:37:03.331
and you can just come back saying,

00:37:03.531 --> 00:37:05.611
“Oh, I am a very unhappy person.”

00:37:05.811 --> 00:37:07.371
What is he going to feel about it?

00:37:07.571 --> 00:37:09.371
No gratitude.

00:37:09.731 --> 00:37:13.001
Count your blessings one by one.

00:37:13.611 --> 00:37:14.851
That’s what one has to do,

00:37:15.451 --> 00:37:19.462
is to have complete understanding

00:37:19.462 --> 00:37:22.314
that he is God Almighty.

00:37:22.314 --> 00:37:25.340
He can do anything that he likes.

00:37:26.371 --> 00:37:31.962
and we are the recipient of His Allmighty.

00:37:32.731 --> 00:37:35.731
He is the Ocean of love,

00:37:35.931 --> 00:37:39.851
and we are the recipient of his love.

00:37:42.771 --> 00:37:49.068
Let us feel that, within ourselves, and understand logically with wisdom.

00:37:49.851 --> 00:37:52.531
If this sets into your mind,

00:37:52.731 --> 00:37:55.731
that’s the best conditioning I think human beings can have,

00:37:57.331 --> 00:37:59.331
what you call in Sanskrit as  "Susamskara",

00:37:59.531 --> 00:38:02.451
means the auspicious conditionings.

00:38:02.651 --> 00:38:05.811
You see, we don't have only conditioning and ego.

00:38:06.011 --> 00:38:10.985
We have third thing called also good conditioning.

00:38:11.491 --> 00:38:15.851
The conditionings that are ruining your chances of enjoyment,

00:38:16.411 --> 00:38:18.811
let it be brought round.

00:38:20.771 --> 00:38:23.651
And see for yourself, logically you can see

00:38:23.851 --> 00:38:28.408
how much is done for you.

00:38:30.811 --> 00:38:34.451
I mean none of the animals were that comfortable as you are.

00:38:34.651 --> 00:38:36.651
They don't know the idea of comfort. I mean they have never had a car,

00:38:36.851 --> 00:38:40.727
even chairs to sit down.

00:38:43.771 --> 00:38:46.851
It's easy to say, "Nice to be like animals" you see.

00:38:46.851 --> 00:38:49.291
But just go and see the way they live poor things!

00:38:49.491 --> 00:38:54.176
No. Even the king of the forest, how he lives, one should go and see.

00:38:54.891 --> 00:38:59.215
But he's happy. He's full of joy.

00:38:59.611 --> 00:39:01.611
Now he has to kill an animal, he'll kill it,

00:39:01.811 --> 00:39:05.367
and with his dignity eat one or two days, finished.

00:39:05.691 --> 00:39:07.651
Then he lives for ten days without food.

00:39:07.851 --> 00:39:11.011
Whenever he feels hungry he goes, he's not bothered.

00:39:11.731 --> 00:39:13.775
He doesn't feel guilty for killing anybody,

00:39:13.775 --> 00:39:17.647
he is hungry, he has to eat, he eats, finished.

00:39:18.971 --> 00:39:20.971
But human beings, as they are,

00:39:21.411 --> 00:39:26.971
they will eat someone without the need, and they'll feel guilty.

00:39:26.971 --> 00:39:30.387
This is the problem.

00:39:33.011 --> 00:39:36.371
He has made you with his own image.

00:39:36.571 --> 00:39:39.740
He's done everything beautifully.

00:39:40.371 --> 00:39:43.411
After Realization, you start understanding yourself

00:39:43.611 --> 00:39:46.491
and enjoying yourself as you enjoy others.

00:39:46.491 --> 00:39:50.124
The fragrance of others you start enjoying.

00:39:51.691 --> 00:39:57.851
Self-realization is the only way, you can get the light in.

00:39:57.851 --> 00:40:01.971
Enlightenment. Everybody talks of enlightenment, enlightenment.

00:40:02.451 --> 00:40:05.971
Enlightenment, means for some people is that you start jumping.

00:40:07.011 --> 00:40:10.851
Is it enlightenement to be abnormal like that?
Or take out your clothes?

00:40:10.851 --> 00:40:13.451
I mean, just think of it, how does it go into your brains,

00:40:13.651 --> 00:40:17.216
I can't understand, that doing all these nonsensical things,

00:40:17.216 --> 00:40:20.283
how can there be enlightenment?

00:40:20.531 --> 00:40:22.611
Or taking to alcohol, drinking or

00:40:22.811 --> 00:40:25.571
drugs or anything. How can it give you enlightenment?

00:40:25.771 --> 00:40:29.102
Has it given to anyone so far?

00:40:29.651 --> 00:40:32.691
It might be some sort of a funny strange experience  you might get,

00:40:32.691 --> 00:40:33.931
but not enlightenment.

00:40:34.411 --> 00:40:36.571
In enlightenment, you get integrated,

00:40:36.771 --> 00:40:39.291
you see your way through, you know where you are standing

00:40:39.491 --> 00:40:42.531
and how you are moving in relationship to others.

00:40:45.451 --> 00:40:51.073
So the illogical method, I would say, unwise method,

00:40:51.073 --> 00:41:04.254
the way we deal with life, becomes a kind of a possession.

00:41:06.491 --> 00:41:11.651
And we are possessed by this negative force which is eating us up.

00:41:11.651 --> 00:41:15.971
And we go on living with that idea, enjoing that idea,

00:41:15.971 --> 00:41:20.621
that, we are miserable people, we are unhappy, we are helpless.

00:41:20.623 --> 00:41:23.602
I mean, I've seen people sitting on the streets and discussing,

00:41:23.602 --> 00:41:27.373
"Oh, thank God, there's going to be 8 stars coming in and we'll be all destroyed".

00:41:27.373 --> 00:41:31.413
I mean just imagine!

00:41:32.731 --> 00:41:35.731
But we have to think about the One who has created us.

00:41:35.931 --> 00:41:39.891
Is he waiting for your destruction, will he be happy with that?

00:41:42.371 --> 00:41:45.922
How much are you cooperating with Him?

00:41:46.491 --> 00:41:51.503
With what care, love, he has created us?

00:41:51.503 --> 00:41:53.177
With what hopes whatever it is,

00:41:53.177 --> 00:41:54.491
what does he want to do for us

00:41:54.771 --> 00:41:56.851
that you are sitting down and feeling guilty?

00:41:57.371 --> 00:41:59.571
And now, I have to tell openly,

00:41:59.771 --> 00:42:04.083
that it has come to you also through other vechicles,

00:42:04.691 --> 00:42:09.157
apart from the psychologists, psychoanalysts.

00:42:09.411 --> 00:42:11.811
Psychoanalysts: the other day we had a girl,

00:42:12.011 --> 00:42:13.451
she came to see Me.

00:42:13.651 --> 00:42:16.651
She's French. Her English was wonderful,

00:42:16.931 --> 00:42:18.331
and she said,

00:42:18.531 --> 00:42:21.571
"Horrible psychologists! They make me mad."

00:42:21.771 --> 00:42:24.611
"Why?" They said, "I have bad relationship with my mother,

00:42:24.811 --> 00:42:26.451
I have bad relationship with my father,

00:42:26.651 --> 00:42:28.531
bad relationship with every third person".

00:42:28.731 --> 00:42:30.811
I don't have that, I've absolutely pure relationship.

00:42:31.011 --> 00:42:32.811
They try to put that idea into my head

00:42:33.011 --> 00:42:35.411
that there's something abnormal, pathological about me

00:42:35.611 --> 00:42:37.558
which I am not!

00:42:37.811 --> 00:42:41.298
And they are making my brother's relationship also funny

00:42:41.298 --> 00:42:44.801
by telling him that I have bad relations with him.

00:42:45.691 --> 00:42:47.396
This is it.

00:42:47.731 --> 00:42:49.771
So they hit at the point of pure love,

00:42:49.971 --> 00:42:51.691
desintegrate you.

00:42:51.891 --> 00:42:54.651
You can't have good relationship with your own mother,

00:42:54.851 --> 00:42:58.956
with your own father, with your own sister, with your brother, and nobody.

00:42:58.956 --> 00:43:01.571
Because you cannot love except for, you are sex points.

00:43:01.771 --> 00:43:03.451
You have just relationship of sex.

00:43:03.451 --> 00:43:05.651
Even animals have better relationship then we have,

00:43:05.851 --> 00:43:07.931
if you have to accept the psychologists.

00:43:09.411 --> 00:43:13.771
And they take money to suggest
all these nonsensical ideas into your head.

00:43:13.771 --> 00:43:17.236
There are some here sitting. I will face them later on.

00:43:19.371 --> 00:43:22.291
This is how they're putting ideas into your heads

00:43:22.491 --> 00:43:27.491
that, "You are a person who has no, no purity

00:43:27.491 --> 00:43:28.891
and that you are a sinner,

00:43:29.331 --> 00:43:32.651
you are a damned person and any person you look upon,

00:43:32.851 --> 00:43:35.651
you have only sex relationships, nothing else.

00:43:35.851 --> 00:43:38.819
I mean are we sex points?

00:43:39.491 --> 00:43:43.467
With all this evolution God has made us into a sex point:

00:43:43.467 --> 00:43:49.432
that's what we have done to ourselves, reduced ourselves to that point only.

00:43:50.851 --> 00:43:54.731
He has created you in your own glory and in your own dignity.

00:43:57.491 --> 00:43:58.731
He's not created you

00:43:58.931 --> 00:44:02.371
to be only wasted like this

00:44:02.611 --> 00:44:06.331
Then the second thing that disintegrates us very much more,

00:44:06.851 --> 00:44:15.060
is the idea that we are here, you see,
to live in a gross way,

00:44:15.491 --> 00:44:19.731
somehow fighting, political, economic,

00:44:20.531 --> 00:44:25.811
all these nonsensical progress that we are making.

00:44:26.491 --> 00:44:30.793
And everything is explained,
all destructive forces are explained

00:44:31.046 --> 00:44:34.651
in the name of political or economic growth.

00:44:35.371 --> 00:44:39.611
I don't know if it is 'growth' or whatever it is,

00:44:39.691 --> 00:44:42.571
but definetely it is not love, take it from me.

00:44:42.771 --> 00:44:45.771
It is not love.

00:44:46.011 --> 00:44:51.351
That's why economics of God is to be understood.

00:44:51.651 --> 00:44:54.738
Politics of God is to be understood.

00:44:54.738 --> 00:44:58.997
And for human beings to understand it, they must have Self-realization.

00:44:59.531 --> 00:45:06.311
In his economics, generosity is the key-note.

00:45:06.811 --> 00:45:10.902
He enjoys his generosity.

00:45:11.731 --> 00:45:17.771
Material things are to express your generosity, isn't it?

00:45:18.651 --> 00:45:20.531
What are they for?

00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:24.651
The most enjoyable thing is to give,

00:45:24.851 --> 00:45:32.851
and when you give, you will see
your economic problems will be solved completely.

00:45:32.851 --> 00:45:35.571
Because you are here to become free,  no problems!

00:45:35.771 --> 00:45:40.025
The problems are because you want to grab.

00:45:41.851 --> 00:45:45.631
And once you start giving, you get it,
as much as you want,

00:45:45.631 --> 00:45:50.759
because if there's no outlet, there's no joy,

00:45:50.759 --> 00:45:53.679
there's no happiness, there's no release.

00:45:53.679 --> 00:45:56.891
from the material domination on you.

00:45:56.891 --> 00:45:59.411
But giving is the way

00:45:59.411 --> 00:46:02.971
you can get rid of that material domination on your head.

00:46:03.691 --> 00:46:05.940
That you give away.

00:46:07.371 --> 00:46:08.651
Give away everything that you have

00:46:08.851 --> 00:46:13.123
and you'll be surprised how it flows to you.

00:46:14.651 --> 00:46:17.491
Now, when I say, "It is fantastic the way it acts.

00:46:17.691 --> 00:46:19.611
Fantastic, the way it acts".

00:46:19.811 --> 00:46:22.331
Somehow, it’s easy to say,

00:46:22.531 --> 00:46:24.371
“It’s Mother is saying something

00:46:24.851 --> 00:46:29.651
which is something miraculous.”

00:46:29.971 --> 00:46:34.331
But what do you think of Moses
crossing the river, crossing the sea?

00:46:34.531 --> 00:46:36.331
You mean, it was miraculous,

00:46:36.531 --> 00:46:41.723
or it was a false stoy or what do you think of it?

00:46:42.531 --> 00:46:44.891
It was absolutely true,

00:46:45.371 --> 00:46:51.200
that he did cross the sea. With the help of God, he could do it.

00:46:52.651 --> 00:46:54.891
What about Christ walking on the water?

00:46:54.891 --> 00:46:57.451
He did because by his nature, he did it.

00:46:58.531 --> 00:47:01.571
What about all the miracles that were done by this Incarnation?

00:47:01.771 --> 00:47:07.305
It's absolutely true, I'm here to prove all of them.

00:47:08.531 --> 00:47:10.451
But you must get your Realization.

00:47:10.651 --> 00:47:12.531
Not because that I cannot prove it,

00:47:12.731 --> 00:47:16.771
You must enter into that realm of awareness.
Otherwise, they cannot prove it.

00:47:16.771 --> 00:47:19.531
It's true. The other day,
somebody was saying that Rama is a fiction.

00:47:19.531 --> 00:47:21.503
I said, "How do you say?"

00:47:21.851 --> 00:47:23.491
He said, "Because, it looks like a fiction".

00:47:23.691 --> 00:47:27.371
I said, "To human mind, they cannot understand God,

00:47:27.371 --> 00:47:31.571
who has millions and millions of hands and eyes

00:47:31.571 --> 00:47:33.611
to work out His plans".

00:47:33.611 --> 00:47:38.411
So, naturally Rama is a fiction.
Krishna is a fiction. Everybody is a fiction!

00:47:38.411 --> 00:47:42.689
Because we ourselves are fictitious, I think.

00:47:43.811 --> 00:47:45.971
It's not that it is a fiction

00:47:45.971 --> 00:47:49.731
but we are incapable of grasping that is miraculous, which is divine.

00:47:49.931 --> 00:47:52.491
and that's why we just call it, "Oh".

00:47:53.851 --> 00:47:57.651
No, everything is true, believe me, everything is true.

00:47:57.851 --> 00:48:00.371
Now, Rama' s case, let's take it.

00:48:00.371 --> 00:48:02.371
Simple to be like Rama, all right?

00:48:02.851 --> 00:48:04.531
"Rama is a fiction".

00:48:04.731 --> 00:48:08.851
Many of our Indians are very anglicised now, very westernized you see.

00:48:08.851 --> 00:48:11.657
So, they want to say, "We don't believe in all these fictions",

00:48:11.657 --> 00:48:14.708
so they're becoming English.

00:48:15.371 --> 00:48:20.371
For them, to become English is the last epitome,
it's the last word.

00:48:20.371 --> 00:48:22.611
"So we don't believe in Rama, nothing, you see." All right,

00:48:22.811 --> 00:48:25.651
it's all our old style of thinking.

00:48:25.651 --> 00:48:28.371
But he exists and he's within us!

00:48:28.371 --> 00:48:32.011
It can be proved with your Kundalini awakening.

00:48:32.011 --> 00:48:37.275
The person who has got asthma, who suffers from asthma,

00:48:37.275 --> 00:48:40.196
catches on the right heart.

00:48:40.196 --> 00:48:44.411
You have to take the name of Rama to cure him.

00:48:44.411 --> 00:48:49.851
Nothing else can cure him. It's simple.

00:48:49.851 --> 00:48:52.571
The Kundalini stops here.

00:48:52.771 --> 00:48:55.411
Many people don't believe in Christ.

00:48:55.611 --> 00:49:01.134
"We don't believe in Christ". But you don't believe in Christ, but under what circumstaces?

00:49:01.134 --> 00:49:05.574
Why, why don't you believe in Christ?

00:49:06.411 --> 00:49:09.975
"Because you see, we don't think he existed, how can it be possible?"

00:49:09.975 --> 00:49:14.436
"We don't believe in Moses, we don't believe in Christ, we don't believe in anybody". All right.

00:49:14.436 --> 00:49:17.698
Do you believe in yourself?

00:49:17.698 --> 00:49:20.505
Perhaps that is missing.

00:49:20.851 --> 00:49:24.456
Because the Self is not there.

00:49:24.456 --> 00:49:27.576
If you know your Self, you should believe in them.

00:49:27.576 --> 00:49:31.411
Because when Kundalini rises, at this point you'll be amazed,

00:49:31.651 --> 00:49:34.451
at this point, whether you believe in Christ or not,

00:49:34.651 --> 00:49:36.451
at this point,

00:49:36.651 --> 00:49:40.411
at the Agnya chakra, where you see the crossing of it,

00:49:40.411 --> 00:49:43.491
you have to say Lord's Prayer.

00:49:43.491 --> 00:49:46.651
You have to take the name of Christ.
Otherwise, Kundalini doesn't rise.

00:49:46.651 --> 00:49:49.411
Now most of the people who are here, who are Realized, know this.

00:49:49.611 --> 00:49:52.158
It has been proved to them.

00:49:52.851 --> 00:49:57.491
In the Nabhi, in this Void,
if it is hanging, you have to take the name of Moses.

00:49:57.491 --> 00:50:01.174
Whether you are a Jew or not, or a hater of Jews
or whatever you may be,

00:50:01.174 --> 00:50:06.827
you have to take the name of a Jew, of Moses.

00:50:07.851 --> 00:50:12.190
The whole movement of the Kundalini is to intergrate

00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:17.851
all the truths which are treated as miraculous,
some people think it's falsehood,

00:50:17.851 --> 00:50:19.811
it's good for nothing, useless.

00:50:20.374 --> 00:50:25.555
All these things are proved by the movement of the Kundalini

00:50:25.555 --> 00:50:28.671
in your central path.

00:50:29.491 --> 00:50:35.038
And the greatest of greatest thing
that is proved, is that God exists.

00:50:35.038 --> 00:50:38.851
Not only exists but he's active,

00:50:38.851 --> 00:50:42.691
that he does everything for us,

00:50:42.691 --> 00:50:46.799
that it is he who is the truth and it 's his power of Brahma,

00:50:46.799 --> 00:50:49.491
is the truth, the rest is all falsehood and nonsense.

00:50:50.411 --> 00:50:54.651
It works in all details too, in small details also.

00:50:55.851 --> 00:50:58.331
Now Sahaja Yogis have seen the miracle of Sahaja Yoga,

00:50:58.531 --> 00:51:00.331
they cannot explain it.

00:51:00.531 --> 00:51:02.651
You cannot explain also.

00:51:02.651 --> 00:51:04.611
When you become Realised, you are surprised

00:51:04.811 --> 00:51:07.116
how you are helped, how you meet people,

00:51:07.116 --> 00:51:09.698
how you get to things, how things work out,

00:51:09.698 --> 00:51:13.243
and how it works out so smoothly, you just can't imagine!

00:51:13.611 --> 00:51:19.851
Even to the smallest detail it can work out beautifully.

00:51:19.851 --> 00:51:23.611
But you have to establish yourself in the kingdom of God.

00:51:23.811 --> 00:51:26.463
Not with these fanatical ideas,

00:51:26.463 --> 00:51:28.724
like you go to the Catholic church and they say,

00:51:28.724 --> 00:51:32.156
"Now you must confess".
I don't know from where did they get this idea!

00:51:32.156 --> 00:51:35.674
I don't think Christ would have ever said that,
"You'd better go and confess to these priests",

00:51:35.674 --> 00:51:37.834
who are not even Realized souls.

00:51:38.691 --> 00:51:42.647
What are they going to do by confession?

00:51:43.771 --> 00:51:46.331
And then the answer came to me from a priest.

00:51:46.531 --> 00:51:48.651
I've asked him, he's a nice man, he's a Realized soul now,

00:51:48.851 --> 00:51:50.891
and he is working for Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:51.371 --> 00:51:54.471
But he told me, "The reason is in the Bible it's written,

00:51:54.491 --> 00:51:56.451
that, 'Whatever is corrected on this earth,

00:51:56.651 --> 00:51:58.551
will be corrected in the heaven'.

00:51:58.651 --> 00:52:00.651
That's why you'd better correct it by telling to the priest."

00:52:00.851 --> 00:52:03.511
Now, by any logical means do you think these priests

00:52:03.531 --> 00:52:07.651
can help you by telling them anything?

00:52:08.491 --> 00:52:13.771
Whatever is to be correced
on this earth is your Kundalini and your chakras.

00:52:14.651 --> 00:52:18.091
If the language of the Bible has been,

00:52:18.331 --> 00:52:19.811
especially the Old Testament,

00:52:20.011 --> 00:52:25.371
has been extremely guarded, it was security measure.

00:52:25.371 --> 00:52:29.771
Like the Tree of Life
is nothing but the Kundalini which is enlightened.

00:52:29.771 --> 00:52:33.571
Absolutely, it is that, it looks like that, like a tree.

00:52:33.771 --> 00:52:35.971
The other day, we were having program - I think today only,

00:52:36.411 --> 00:52:38.651
my children showed me, "Look, the Kundalini".

00:52:38.851 --> 00:52:42.371
I went and saw they were describing about Moses something,

00:52:42.371 --> 00:52:45.196
perhaps, and this was the Tree of Life, they said.

00:52:45.196 --> 00:52:49.244
And my children, grandchildren said, "See, the Kundalini".

00:52:50.611 --> 00:52:57.371
The language they used, may be for security measures made,

00:52:57.371 --> 00:53:01.411
but not the word,

00:53:01.411 --> 00:53:05.491
if it is now changed by human beings, it's false.

00:53:05.491 --> 00:53:08.491
Human beings can change words, that's a different point,

00:53:08.691 --> 00:53:11.851
but you can see, in Sahaja Yoga you can see what is changed,

00:53:12.331 --> 00:53:15.571
what is wrong, which is falsehood. You can see all these things.

00:53:15.771 --> 00:53:17.531
So, to disintegrate you,

00:53:17.731 --> 00:53:21.571
these things are again created in the name of religion, so-called.

00:53:22.517 --> 00:53:24.288
I mean these people are there for God

00:53:24.288 --> 00:53:27.377
or for making you feel guilty?

00:53:27.731 --> 00:53:33.451
Like, say Jews think that Christ was not a saviour.

00:53:33.451 --> 00:53:38.303
If they are still waiting for two hundred years. It's not true.

00:53:38.691 --> 00:53:41.771
He's the One, without Him you cannot raise the Kundalini.

00:53:41.971 --> 00:53:44.771
One should understand that he's the Mahavishnu described.

00:53:45.274 --> 00:53:46.954
But if I say something,

00:53:46.954 --> 00:53:49.451
that doesn't mean that you should believe Me. Not at all.

00:53:49.451 --> 00:53:52.611
But you should see for yourself because if you are interested,

00:53:52.811 --> 00:53:54.651
in the emancipation of the whole world,

00:53:54.851 --> 00:53:59.371
you should not get stuck on one,

00:53:59.371 --> 00:54:00.611
stuck on to one thing,

00:54:00.811 --> 00:54:03.371
and say, "This is the truth and this is the truth".

00:54:03.371 --> 00:54:04.971
No, seek for yourself what is the truth.

00:54:05.411 --> 00:54:07.411
And you'll be amazed that they are all one.

00:54:07.611 --> 00:54:09.531
Like Christ has said, "Those who are not against me

00:54:09.731 --> 00:54:12.762
are people who are with me".

00:54:13.851 --> 00:54:17.531
Moses and Christ are one, which can be proved.

00:54:18.851 --> 00:54:20.371
Same in other religions.

00:54:20.571 --> 00:54:22.571
So religion is another way to disintegrate you.

00:54:22.771 --> 00:54:27.275
You hate each other. Fundamentalists, fighting for what?

00:54:27.691 --> 00:54:29.531
Fundamental difference you know.

00:54:29.731 --> 00:54:31.103
Can you imagine?

00:54:31.103 --> 00:54:34.571
What is the fundamental of these religions? It’s their Spirit, isn’t it?

00:54:34.771 --> 00:54:38.651
Is it a difference between the Spirit of one and another?

00:54:38.651 --> 00:54:44.382
Fundamentals are that God is one.  He's created us

00:54:44.382 --> 00:54:45.503
and what are you fighting about?

00:54:45.754 --> 00:54:47.314
Fundamental difference, you know? Fundamental difference,

00:54:47.491 --> 00:54:50.316
when there exists no difference at all.

00:54:50.691 --> 00:54:52.611
So we have psychologists,

00:54:52.811 --> 00:54:58.222
we have religious leaders, teaching us how to fight and hate God

00:54:58.222 --> 00:55:03.303
and your fellow being, in the name of God.

00:55:03.851 --> 00:55:06.851
This is another disintegration that sets into us.

00:55:07.331 --> 00:55:12.877
So, you people who are thinking, should understand

00:55:12.877 --> 00:55:15.331
that anything that creates such limitation within us

00:55:15.531 --> 00:55:17.451
any kind of fanaticism,

00:55:17.651 --> 00:55:20.811
is dangerous not only to you but to the whole society,

00:55:21.011 --> 00:55:22.651
and if you support it, even this much,

00:55:22.851 --> 00:55:25.297
you are supporting their destruction.

00:55:29.371 --> 00:55:31.411
With Sahaja Yoga we can establish,

00:55:31.411 --> 00:55:33.691
that anybody who is a fanatic,

00:55:33.891 --> 00:55:36.811
has problems and sufferes from many diseases

00:55:37.011 --> 00:55:38.651
which normal people don't.

00:55:40.851 --> 00:55:43.491
Then there are another type of people who

00:55:43.491 --> 00:55:46.731
say that, "All right, we don't believe in God.

00:55:46.731 --> 00:55:49.611
Because how can God create this fanaticism?"

00:55:49.851 --> 00:55:51.651
How can you blame God for fanaticism?

00:55:51.851 --> 00:55:53.731
I just can't understand. He never created it.

00:55:53.931 --> 00:55:57.331
Actually, he never created any difference between you people,

00:55:57.331 --> 00:56:00.851
just a variety, just to make it beautiful, that's all.

00:56:00.851 --> 00:56:03.651
See, he didn't create England separately, this separately,

00:56:03.851 --> 00:56:07.371
to that extent the way you think. But he created them

00:56:07.371 --> 00:56:10.599
because they are different organs in the body of God.

00:56:11.691 --> 00:56:13.931
Do we take out an eye, and say "This is an eye

00:56:13.931 --> 00:56:18.061
so I do not have anything to do with it". Can we?

00:56:18.611 --> 00:56:20.371
It's like that!

00:56:20.571 --> 00:56:23.411
It's simple like that, it's so simple.

00:56:23.411 --> 00:56:27.491
The truth is so simple and so starkly lit before you:

00:56:27.491 --> 00:56:34.160
that we are doing all these things, fighting, quarelling,

00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:39.193
all the time within ourselves and without.

00:56:39.491 --> 00:56:42.531
Now, for that Self-realization,

00:56:42.731 --> 00:56:45.771
God has placed this wonderful thing, Kundalini within us,

00:56:45.971 --> 00:56:49.851
very beautifully, in the best possible position.

00:56:49.851 --> 00:56:52.851
It could not be better anywhere.

00:56:52.851 --> 00:56:55.691
To create this happening within us, in our awareness,

00:56:55.891 --> 00:56:59.611
the Kundalini has to rise and give us Realization.

00:56:59.611 --> 00:57:02.371
Now, people ask questions to God also, can be.

00:57:02.371 --> 00:57:06.911
They can say, "Why did he do it?
Why didn't he make us wise, to begin with?"

00:57:06.911 --> 00:57:07.811
There are many like that.

00:57:07.811 --> 00:57:09.611
He should have just make us wise.

00:57:09.811 --> 00:57:13.904
Just from monkeys, dipped into some wisdom powder

00:57:13.904 --> 00:57:16.126
and pushed us out as wise people

00:57:16.126 --> 00:57:18.521
living in the kingdom of God.

00:57:19.731 --> 00:57:25.331
"Why didn't he do it in our evolution,
why did he make us so stupid?"

00:57:25.331 --> 00:57:28.851
One can say to God, you see,
"Why did You create these problems?", talking to God.

00:57:28.851 --> 00:57:31.531
But who are we to ask Him questions? You see, he does what he likes.

00:57:31.731 --> 00:57:37.087
But, there's a reason.

00:57:37.087 --> 00:57:42.343
If you have to enter into that complete freedom,
you must know how to be free.

00:57:42.691 --> 00:57:45.651
If you are just abandoned people, you have no sense of freedom,

00:57:45.851 --> 00:57:50.197
you don't know how to be choosy about the good and the bad,

00:57:50.197 --> 00:57:55.780
and you do not understand the value of your own wisdom.

00:57:56.371 --> 00:57:58.771
And if you are put in charge, imagine,

00:57:58.971 --> 00:58:02.491
some mad people put in charge in government, what will happen to you?

00:58:02.851 --> 00:58:06.503
So you have to grow up to that point to feel your freedom

00:58:06.503 --> 00:58:09.249
that in your freedom, you are righteous.

00:58:09.249 --> 00:58:13.442
In that freedom, you are kind.

00:58:13.442 --> 00:58:21.811
In that freedom, you are absolutely balanced.

00:58:22.851 --> 00:58:26.651
And when that happens to you,

00:58:26.651 --> 00:58:29.411
then only the higher freedom is given to you.

00:58:29.611 --> 00:58:31.851
Because that's completely free.

00:58:31.851 --> 00:58:35.851
And once that high freedom comes into you,

00:58:35.851 --> 00:58:43.693
then you can feel the responsibility,

00:58:43.693 --> 00:58:52.581
the responsibility to be responsible for your freedom.

00:58:53.451 --> 00:58:56.703
To put this beautiful responsability onto you

00:58:56.903 --> 00:58:58.611
you have to know how to use your freedom.

00:58:58.811 --> 00:59:01.491
This is only transition which has led all of us,

00:59:01.691 --> 00:59:03.651
into this feeling 'guilty business',

00:59:03.851 --> 00:59:06.411
or this agression. Can you imagine?

00:59:06.611 --> 00:59:10.466
You could have waited for a while

00:59:10.466 --> 00:59:13.941
without feeling so sick.

00:59:14.331 --> 00:59:20.134
I mean, sometimes I feel the people are going for a funeral,

00:59:20.134 --> 00:59:23.371
the way they look miserable.

00:59:23.371 --> 00:59:27.731
The rest are busy creating such people.

00:59:27.731 --> 00:59:31.158
So there are only two types of people, if one sees:

00:59:31.158 --> 00:59:36.871
some who are being victims and another who are victimizing.

00:59:37.411 --> 00:59:41.331
So, to have the balance, in the center, to stand in the center,

00:59:41.851 --> 00:59:46.816
God has created this little tide

00:59:46.816 --> 00:59:49.524
where you have to just learn how to weigh your freedom.

00:59:49.524 --> 00:59:51.503
He gave you freedom to know,.

00:59:51.503 --> 00:59:53.691
And this freedom is the only thing that has created,

00:59:53.891 --> 00:59:57.147
all the problems you face, not God.

00:59:57.147 --> 01:00:02.691
God hasn't created any problems for you. No. He wanted to make a very smooth ascent.

01:00:02.691 --> 01:00:05.771
He's made your machines so beautifully.

01:00:05.771 --> 01:00:10.056
Despite all this, you do get your Realization, no doubt.

01:00:10.056 --> 01:00:13.651
But because of habits, you may run down again to it;

01:00:13.651 --> 01:00:16.371
again you may have an ascent, again go down.

01:00:16.371 --> 01:00:18.491
It happens with some people, doesn't matter.

01:00:18.491 --> 01:00:22.731
But if you are steady, it is going to work out.

01:00:22.731 --> 01:00:25.499
It has to work out.

01:00:25.499 --> 01:00:29.821
If God has to save his creation, he has to do it.

01:00:29.821 --> 01:00:36.251
Only thing: how many are going to cooperate
and take advantage of his compassion is to be seen.

01:00:36.251 --> 01:00:45.464
That is the most important thing,
how many are going to be wise to see to their own advantage,

01:00:45.464 --> 01:00:48.571
to their own ascent.

01:00:48.571 --> 01:00:51.851
It's the only choice.

01:00:51.851 --> 01:00:56.022
May God bless you.

01:00:56.851 --> 01:00:59.531
If you have any questions you may ask me,

01:00:59.531 --> 01:01:04.400
and then I will do the Realization.

01:01:07.371 --> 01:01:10.731
Mother, how the negative force is created?

01:01:11.371 --> 01:01:12.451
What's it?

01:01:12.451 --> 01:01:15.011
How this negative force is created to begin within?

01:01:15.491 --> 01:01:17.491
What is he saying?

01:01:17.491 --> 01:01:21.256
How the negative force is created, to begin with?

01:01:22.164 --> 01:01:26.357
By the great human beings.

01:01:28.611 --> 01:01:33.731
Who has created atom bomb? Same type.

01:01:33.731 --> 01:01:37.851
From the very beginning,
they started creating this negative force.

01:01:37.851 --> 01:01:40.945
All kinds.

01:01:41.691 --> 01:01:49.451
In seeking, as I told you, in seeking,
they set in this vicious circle

01:01:49.451 --> 01:01:53.451
which started creating.
And the, you see, this mistake is small.

01:01:53.651 --> 01:01:59.211
What is the mistake in separating a hydrogen atom, isn't it?

01:01:59.211 --> 01:02:01.491
Just they did it, you see, for fun sake maybe.

01:02:01.491 --> 01:02:04.122
I don't know why they did it.

01:02:04.451 --> 01:02:07.731
But now, that will become like a devil
sitting on everybody's head, in everybody.

01:02:07.731 --> 01:02:11.851
Thank God only, whatever they create frightens them, thank God.

01:02:11.851 --> 01:02:14.451
So they are not going to use it, but

01:02:14.651 --> 01:02:18.915
who has created that? Human beings.

01:02:18.915 --> 01:02:20.913
In ignorance, they have done it.

01:02:20.913 --> 01:02:23.172
As a Mother, I have to say that.

01:02:23.172 --> 01:02:25.691
I cannot say that it was deliberated.

01:02:25.891 --> 01:02:29.951
It's a dangerous situation there.

01:02:34.371 --> 01:02:37.451
It's obvious, in your lifetime, people have created atom bombs.

01:02:37.651 --> 01:02:40.546
What was the need?

01:02:41.371 --> 01:02:43.005
I mean, for a stranger like me,

01:02:43.005 --> 01:02:45.504
I don't understand what is the need to create an atom bomb,

01:02:45.504 --> 01:02:48.332
what is the need?

01:02:50.531 --> 01:02:53.266
Who are they to create this kind of a democracy

01:02:53.266 --> 01:02:56.476
and this kind of communism,

01:02:56.476 --> 01:02:59.651
and this kind of all nonsensical institutions,

01:02:59.851 --> 01:03:03.001
which just make the people fight?

01:03:10.811 --> 01:03:12.651
Any other questions please?

01:03:12.851 --> 01:03:14.891
And you can't blame God for that.

01:03:15.371 --> 01:03:19.364
At least, God didn't tell you to make atom bomb.

01:03:26.731 --> 01:03:28.651
Any other question please?

01:03:29.571 --> 01:03:30.571
I have got one.

01:03:30.771 --> 01:03:31.371
Yes.

01:03:31.571 --> 01:03:33.651
Why do you think, are people

01:03:33.851 --> 01:03:36.651
all the time so afraid of losing things,

01:03:36.851 --> 01:03:41.611
of losing their ego, of losing their relatives, or-

01:03:42.371 --> 01:03:45.546
but not losing but -

01:03:45.851 --> 01:03:48.851
losing their - what they have built up in themselves,

01:03:49.331 --> 01:03:51.451
their identity that they think they are.

01:03:51.651 --> 01:03:53.651
They are afraid of losing it.

01:03:54.371 --> 01:03:55.811
Why they are afraid?

01:03:56.011 --> 01:03:56.771
Yes.

01:03:56.971 --> 01:03:59.451
They have been cooked up like that, you know.

01:03:59.851 --> 01:04:02.371
They are told like that, they are conditioned like that.

01:04:02.651 --> 01:04:03.891
What can they do?

01:04:04.371 --> 01:04:06.451
You see, that all the time, if somebody tells you

01:04:06.651 --> 01:04:08.651
that you are going to lose, "It's very precious, very precious",

01:04:08.851 --> 01:04:10.851
you see, you'll hold on to it.

01:04:11.451 --> 01:04:14.451
But one must know in growth, in life,

01:04:14.451 --> 01:04:16.691
when a flower becomes a fruit,

01:04:16.891 --> 01:04:19.851
it looses flower for fruit to come,

01:04:19.851 --> 01:04:22.651
to grow into new.

01:04:22.651 --> 01:04:29.275
When an egg breaks,
its shell falls off and the bird comes out.

01:04:29.275 --> 01:04:33.631
It's not a loosing, it is growth.

01:04:34.531 --> 01:04:41.154
You have been frightened, what can you do?
From the very beginning.

01:04:41.851 --> 01:04:45.677
What is there to lose
if you are not holding on to anything?

01:04:46.731 --> 01:04:47.891
All right?

01:04:48.331 --> 01:04:50.531
What is there to lose, you just tell me?

01:04:50.771 --> 01:04:52.651
If you're not holding onto something,

01:04:52.851 --> 01:04:55.858
then, if there's no catch on anything,

01:04:55.903 --> 01:04:59.618
what are you going to loose? You are just enjoing on giving.

01:05:02.491 --> 01:05:05.339
What do we take from here?

01:05:05.851 --> 01:05:08.331
When we go our hands are like this,

01:05:08.691 --> 01:05:11.257
when we come our hands are like this.

01:05:11.531 --> 01:05:14.096
Our hands are open, when we go.

01:05:14.096 --> 01:05:17.451
We can't take anything, we confess it.

01:05:17.451 --> 01:05:22.740
Even ego we leave here. Everything we leave here.

01:05:24.891 --> 01:05:27.491
All myths, so many myths have been created,

01:05:27.691 --> 01:05:29.531
and man is living with the mythical ideas.

01:05:29.731 --> 01:05:32.571
I tell you he's living, he's compromizing with the myths.

01:05:32.771 --> 01:05:35.010
All the time, he doesn't accept a myth

01:05:35.010 --> 01:05:37.371
then they say, "He's not a sane person".

01:05:37.371 --> 01:05:39.691
All sorts of, and then many, many myths set in.

01:05:39.891 --> 01:05:43.531
People start copying others, you see, blindly.

01:05:43.811 --> 01:05:48.531
It's all, you see, to an ignorant person like me,

01:05:48.531 --> 01:05:54.079
it's something I just don't understand; what is the need?

01:05:56.571 --> 01:06:00.303
But I'm talking of the real world where you have to enter into,

01:06:00.491 --> 01:06:01.811
it is reality.

01:06:02.011 --> 01:06:07.303
And do you know? Reality is love.

01:06:07.491 --> 01:06:09.503
It's love.

01:06:09.851 --> 01:06:14.238
But not the way human beings understand love.

01:06:14.238 --> 01:06:17.731
But love which flows,

01:06:17.731 --> 01:06:21.503
which thinks, which cooperates,

01:06:21.531 --> 01:06:25.668
and generates the feeling of joy.

01:06:26.771 --> 01:06:29.971
It's a very different world that we have to enter into.

01:06:30.651 --> 01:06:35.611
But what will you lose? What have you got?

01:06:35.611 --> 01:06:39.243
What you have that is lost?

01:06:39.491 --> 01:06:40.611
That's your Spirit.

01:06:40.811 --> 01:06:44.788
And what you don't have, you are holding on to it.

01:06:45.571 --> 01:06:47.531
There's nothing to be lost, it's very true,

01:06:47.531 --> 01:06:51.215
they are so fightened, you don't know.

01:06:51.215 --> 01:06:55.296
Very frightened.

01:06:58.531 --> 01:07:04.106
They are made like that, what can you do?

01:07:04.451 --> 01:07:06.491
But they lose everything to a person

01:07:06.691 --> 01:07:09.851
who knows how to handle this condition in the real sense.

01:07:10.531 --> 01:07:13.799
You can just become like a cabage with some people.

01:07:13.799 --> 01:07:17.001
Really, they can make you a cabbage.

01:07:18.331 --> 01:07:21.503
In the name of God, in the name of enlightenement, they can.

01:07:21.503 --> 01:07:24.230
Yes, they can harm you.

01:07:28.371 --> 01:07:30.056
Then they are not worried.

01:07:30.056 --> 01:07:32.611
I don't know how they get this confidence with that.

01:07:32.611 --> 01:07:35.611
Like the other day,
we had somebody from 'Charismatic Movement'.

01:07:35.811 --> 01:07:37.851
You remember that? Norman.

01:07:37.851 --> 01:07:40.451
And I hope you have not taken any

01:07:40.651 --> 01:07:42.531
photographe of him, did you?

01:07:42.531 --> 01:07:44.531
We were also worried about him.

01:07:44.731 --> 01:07:48.571
And he went into such movements of the body,

01:07:48.571 --> 01:07:51.571
for at least half an hour

01:07:51.771 --> 01:07:54.851
he was so much in a very funny type of epilepsy, you see.

01:07:55.638 --> 01:07:59.995
All his body was moving and terrible he was crying, weeping

01:07:59.995 --> 01:08:02.740
he fell down on the ground, you can't imagine.

01:08:03.851 --> 01:08:06.611
And he said, "This I've been doing and so many are doing like this,

01:08:06.811 --> 01:08:08.571
and they think they are getting into Holy Ghost".

01:08:08.771 --> 01:08:10.611
I said, "Holy Ghost?

01:08:10.811 --> 01:08:13.651
What an unholy thing it is to be like that".

01:08:14.851 --> 01:08:18.942
Holy Ghost? Can you imagine?

01:08:26.851 --> 01:08:28.811
He wanted to get out of it. He could not.

01:08:29.011 --> 01:08:30.411
Now, he's all right, perfectly all right.

01:08:30.611 --> 01:08:32.611
He's like a small little child.

01:08:32.811 --> 01:08:36.503
I wish you could see that, John.

01:08:36.571 --> 01:08:40.851
You should have seen it, really.

01:08:40.851 --> 01:08:45.940
Shocking it was. Much worse than TM, I tell you, much worse.

01:08:46.531 --> 01:08:50.851
Because the movement was so fast,

01:08:51.093 --> 01:08:54.611
unrhythmic, big fast movements.

01:08:54.611 --> 01:08:59.102
The whole body was gesticulating and this was too much.

01:09:03.611 --> 01:09:07.004
But he got cured.

01:09:13.451 --> 01:09:17.816
Any other question?

01:09:23.011 --> 01:09:27.800
Ego is one problem, I must say, it's a very big problem.

01:09:28.611 --> 01:09:31.830
And for ego,

01:09:31.830 --> 01:09:35.851
like some people say,  "Mother, why You should do it?"

01:09:35.851 --> 01:09:38.531
I said, "You better do it, it's very good idea.

01:09:38.731 --> 01:09:41.029
I would like to retire".

01:09:41.029 --> 01:09:43.954
But you can't do it, what to do? You see.

01:09:43.954 --> 01:09:47.356
All right, now you do so many things, I don´t feel bad.

01:09:47.356 --> 01:09:49.719
Why should you feel bad if I know something.

01:09:49.719 --> 01:09:52.759
You know one thing I know is to awaken, awakening of the Kundalini.

01:09:52.759 --> 01:09:55.182
Now, what can I do about it?

01:09:55.651 --> 01:09:58.355
Are you going to crucify me for that?

01:10:01.851 --> 01:10:05.701
I mean I don't get any - what you call -

01:10:05.701 --> 01:10:08.037
title from your government for that,

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:10.601
no payment, nothing.

01:10:13.411 --> 01:10:14.651
So why? Why to feel bad?

01:10:14.851 --> 01:10:16.531
I mean I will make you the same way.

01:10:16.731 --> 01:10:19.651
You will raise other's Kundalini also.

01:10:19.851 --> 01:10:21.651
So what's the harm?

01:10:21.851 --> 01:10:25.611
You will, of course, you are going to do it yourself.

01:10:25.611 --> 01:10:28.291
Supposing I have the keys with me: if I give you the keys

01:10:28.491 --> 01:10:30.611
will you feel your ego will be hurt or not?

01:10:30.851 --> 01:10:33.531
See, if I am a trustee, I have to give you isn't it?

01:10:34.491 --> 01:10:37.811
Do you feel your ego hurt, if I give you your keys?

01:10:37.811 --> 01:10:40.940
It's so simple as that.

01:10:44.851 --> 01:10:47.611
This is your own, this is your own property, I've got the keys,

01:10:47.811 --> 01:10:51.116
I'll give you because I have got them, now what to do?

01:10:51.411 --> 01:10:54.214
If you have them, it's very good,

01:10:54.214 --> 01:10:57.042
You never had, so I'm giving you.

01:10:58.851 --> 01:11:02.851
What is there to feel hurt about that part?

01:11:02.851 --> 01:11:04.571
Actually, I have to work very hard.

01:11:04.571 --> 01:11:06.423
You don't have to work hard at all.

01:11:06.491 --> 01:11:09.581
To begin with, then up to you.

01:11:17.411 --> 01:11:20.061
Any other question?

01:11:21.691 --> 01:11:24.011
I would like Sahaja Yogis to ask me questions,

01:11:24.491 --> 01:11:27.531
for one reason, because when they are faced with life, and

01:11:27.731 --> 01:11:29.371
other people will ask them questions,

01:11:29.371 --> 01:11:32.479
so any questions which you have not been able to answer

01:11:32.479 --> 01:11:36.503
you can ask me and then we have our Realization.

01:11:39.571 --> 01:11:40.516
Mother?

01:11:40.516 --> 01:11:41.495
Yes?

01:11:41.495 --> 01:11:44.971
What is the approach towards the Christian Church?

01:11:44.971 --> 01:11:46.331
What is it?

01:11:46.531 --> 01:11:50.371
What it's our approach, the line, for the Christian Church?

01:11:50.371 --> 01:11:53.566
Have pity for them.

01:11:57.731 --> 01:12:02.182
You see, I took my birth in the Christian religion, in India,

01:12:02.851 --> 01:12:05.651
and first, the Hindus, you see, they were very upset

01:12:05.851 --> 01:12:10.495
that, "How could She take birth in a Christian religion?"

01:12:10.495 --> 01:12:13.606
I mean, so-called Christian religion.

01:12:13.851 --> 01:12:21.503
And I must tell you, I was baptized forcibly by a Lutheran Church.

01:12:21.503 --> 01:12:24.326
All right?

01:12:25.571 --> 01:12:32.394
The simple answer is that Christians are the most fanatic people.

01:12:32.771 --> 01:12:36.503
And the Indian Christians are the worst

01:12:36.503 --> 01:12:40.122
because they think Christ was born in England.

01:12:40.651 --> 01:12:43.451
Really they think so. You see, if you have an English name

01:12:43.651 --> 01:12:46.451
then you are a real Christian. Otherwise, you are not.

01:12:46.451 --> 01:12:49.851
You can't imagine how ignorant they are.

01:12:49.851 --> 01:12:53.851
And how the Christans are most fanatic. It looks funny but it is so.

01:12:54.691 --> 01:13:00.451
Because their fanatism is so beautifully managed.

01:13:00.451 --> 01:13:03.851
It is not like Khomeini is, which is stark open fanaticism.

01:13:04.651 --> 01:13:08.571
You know, Khomeini is that and he has to accept he is.

01:13:08.571 --> 01:13:13.491
But this way it is very well polished, you know, beautifully done.

01:13:13.491 --> 01:13:16.677
Others can be said they are stones

01:13:16.677 --> 01:13:19.491
but this is like a diamond artificially made.

01:13:19.851 --> 01:13:24.973
They do social work this Christian way.

01:13:24.973 --> 01:13:27.611
Now for example, if you ask somebody the way in England,

01:13:27.811 --> 01:13:30.263
it's a Christian way to tell the way, you see.

01:13:30.371 --> 01:13:33.771
What God has got to do with this?Just tell me.

01:13:33.771 --> 01:13:35.691
They have mixed up God with all these things,

01:13:35.891 --> 01:13:38.451
it's such a big mixture they have made,

01:13:38.451 --> 01:13:43.859
that the fanaticism of Christianity is very much in delusion.

01:13:45.771 --> 01:13:52.550
For them, begging in the name of God is also Christian.

01:13:53.491 --> 01:13:55.617
It's a very dangerous game,

01:13:55.617 --> 01:13:58.811
because they are the cleverest of all, they think.

01:13:58.811 --> 01:14:02.371
So, the way they have entangled themselves into,

01:14:02.851 --> 01:14:07.491
it's so much dogmatic and so beautifully philosophised.

01:14:07.851 --> 01:14:09.851
It's a philosophy.

01:14:09.851 --> 01:14:12.531
To know it, you have to get out of it.

01:14:12.531 --> 01:14:17.702
It is so beautiful, you can't imagine. It's so beautiful.

01:14:18.491 --> 01:14:23.849
And so appealing, they are the most kindest people,

01:14:23.849 --> 01:14:28.719
compassion personified, great people, Christians.

01:14:28.719 --> 01:14:32.594
And the Christains believe it. Christ never asked you to beg.

01:14:33.456 --> 01:14:36.651
He never asked you to collect money for the poor.

01:14:36.851 --> 01:14:41.137
Nothing of the kind. It was not his idea at all, you see.

01:14:41.491 --> 01:14:43.651
He wanted you to get your Realization.

01:14:43.851 --> 01:14:46.438
That's what he wanted.

01:14:46.771 --> 01:14:49.651
You have created the poor.

01:14:49.651 --> 01:14:53.611
And you'd better look after them. That's not God's job.

01:14:53.611 --> 01:14:56.491
Communists may be the greatest Christians, like that,

01:14:56.771 --> 01:14:59.491
the way they look after their poor.

01:14:59.851 --> 01:15:04.782
God's job is one: is to give you Realization. Not other one.

01:15:06.331 --> 01:15:12.489
To take you away from this ignorance and mire of life,

01:15:13.851 --> 01:15:17.901
into that beautiful, blissful, kingdom of God.

01:15:17.901 --> 01:15:21.503
That is the work of God.

01:15:21.651 --> 01:15:24.371
And not these things which you describe back.

01:15:24.571 --> 01:15:29.524
But it looks so idealistic, you know,
the whole thing is such an idealism.

01:15:30.331 --> 01:15:32.491
That's why it's very, very dangerous.

01:15:32.691 --> 01:15:36.503
And it's so well organized.

01:15:38.371 --> 01:15:42.611
So well organized, you know, so well organized.

01:15:42.611 --> 01:15:47.011
Even the hymn numbers, everything is done so well,
every book done so well.

01:15:47.011 --> 01:15:51.503
Stand up to sing. Now you sit down.
So regimented, beautifully.

01:15:51.651 --> 01:15:54.256
No one can realize even that this is,

01:15:54.256 --> 01:15:56.851
we are going all to madness, you see.

01:15:56.851 --> 01:15:59.851
It's a very wonderful thing.

01:16:00.531 --> 01:16:02.731
You are not supposed to look this side or that side.

01:16:02.931 --> 01:16:05.811
It's all right. In England, I have Christians,

01:16:05.811 --> 01:16:07.931
many have been Christians, you see.

01:16:08.371 --> 01:16:10.737
I have Christians, Jews, all kinds of disciples.

01:16:10.737 --> 01:16:14.971
Indian Christians, I don't have even one. Except for,
of course, my family people are from there,

01:16:14.971 --> 01:16:16.931
but they've known my childhood, they know me.

01:16:17.371 --> 01:16:21.945
But the rest of them, for them I am a healer!

01:16:24.331 --> 01:16:28.332
I am, believe me!

01:16:30.651 --> 01:16:35.065
Hindus are my disciples, then Muslims are. But not Christians.

01:16:35.491 --> 01:16:40.227
Not one, I knew this.

01:16:41.851 --> 01:16:49.782
And when I went to America,
they pronounced, "A Christian mystic has come".

01:16:49.782 --> 01:16:53.972
That gave me good marks, you know.

01:16:55.371 --> 01:16:59.396
People came to see me because I was a Christian mystic,

01:16:59.396 --> 01:17:05.906
properly baptized. I must get my certificate also.

01:17:08.851 --> 01:17:13.651
So our attitude should be of simply pity towards them.

01:17:13.651 --> 01:17:16.531
Like Blake has said, "The priest cursed,

01:17:17.451 --> 01:17:20.291
cursed my head when he baptized me."

01:17:20.491 --> 01:17:22.416
It's something like that, it is really.

01:17:22.416 --> 01:17:24.651
We should have really simple pity for all the people,

01:17:24.851 --> 01:17:28.651
who go to churches where there are all the graves.

01:17:28.851 --> 01:17:32.651
They sit on the graves, take all the spirits into themselves.

01:17:32.851 --> 01:17:35.497
God save them.

01:17:38.851 --> 01:17:46.321
I don't know why Christians, everyone is just like that.

01:17:49.011 --> 01:17:52.491
But, among the Christians only, I am sure,

01:17:52.731 --> 01:17:57.498
one day Sahaja Yoga will come up very well.

01:17:58.531 --> 01:18:07.509
That's the power of Christ. I hope so.
I hope so.

01:18:10.491 --> 01:18:15.431
Mislaid, and misled people also,

01:18:15.691 --> 01:18:18.371
who are enjoying that misleading

01:18:18.371 --> 01:18:21.491
are most difficult, aren't they?
Don't you think so?

01:18:21.531 --> 01:18:24.611
How can you talk to them?

01:18:24.611 --> 01:18:27.851
Who can break it?

01:18:33.491 --> 01:18:36.451
When I go to India, I can speak,

01:18:36.771 --> 01:18:42.491
in a 'sanathana', means Catholic,
'sankar sanathana' means Catholic temple,

01:18:42.691 --> 01:18:45.651
where thousands of people came to attend my lecture

01:18:45.851 --> 01:18:48.651
and they respect me as a saint.

01:18:48.651 --> 01:18:51.931
Do you think in any church whatsoever,

01:18:52.491 --> 01:18:54.411
I would be respected like that,

01:18:54.411 --> 01:18:57.651
except for one "Unity Church" we had,

01:18:57.651 --> 01:18:59.771
where all kinds of bhoots are respected.

01:18:59.771 --> 01:19:03.331
So, I was also called to give a lecture.

01:19:03.851 --> 01:19:09.731
It was I think more of a - I don't know,
money-making proposition whatever it was.

01:19:09.731 --> 01:19:12.458
Whatever it was.

01:19:13.611 --> 01:19:17.531
But in India, that's the blessing

01:19:17.771 --> 01:19:19.811
of the Hindus that they are not organized.

01:19:20.011 --> 01:19:23.371
For them, a saint is a saint.

01:19:24.371 --> 01:19:32.681
Even the Prime minister, even, I would say, the president

01:19:32.681 --> 01:19:37.826
of India would stand for a saint. They wouldn't sit.

01:19:39.651 --> 01:19:42.397
These ideas are not here.

01:19:42.651 --> 01:19:47.951
We're too organized to get out of this organized way,

01:19:47.951 --> 01:19:52.023
to find out what is beyond. You see, we just -

01:19:52.023 --> 01:19:55.610
all our spirituality is satisfied by going to Sunday church,

01:19:55.610 --> 01:19:58.900
finished! Or to give some money for the feat. That's all.

01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:00.451
That's not the way it is.

01:20:00.651 --> 01:20:02.731
It's much, much, much more.

01:20:03.851 --> 01:20:06.691
But be kind to them.

01:20:07.451 --> 01:20:11.851
Christ has said, "You'll be calling me, 'Christ, Christ'.
I won't recognize you"

01:20:11.851 --> 01:20:18.849
That's what they are. I'm sorry for them, really sorry.

01:20:22.851 --> 01:20:24.975
Any other question?

01:20:26.491 --> 01:20:29.491
Mother, can everybody become aware at the most

01:20:29.491 --> 01:20:31.491
how do you recognize them up?

01:20:31.691 --> 01:20:34.531
Yes, everybody can.

01:20:34.771 --> 01:20:37.611
But everybody doesn't mind, want it.

01:20:37.851 --> 01:20:42.456
You see, they don't want it. See how many people are here.

01:20:43.731 --> 01:20:46.451
But if it was some sort of a falsehood,

01:20:46.451 --> 01:20:48.651
if I'd come with two horns,

01:20:48.651 --> 01:20:52.303
there could have been three halls big like this.

01:20:53.371 --> 01:20:56.571
People don't want reality, my child, they don't want it.

01:20:56.851 --> 01:20:58.851
They never wanted it.

01:20:59.491 --> 01:21:01.491
They always crucified it.

01:21:02.851 --> 01:21:05.651
But now, at least, there are some who really want it.

01:21:05.851 --> 01:21:08.611
And I am happy you think of others also,

01:21:08.611 --> 01:21:11.001
very happy to know that.

01:21:12.275 --> 01:21:16.155
But it’s a difficult task.

01:21:16.811 --> 01:21:20.243
I have to work very hard.

01:21:21.491 --> 01:21:24.451
They don't want reality
because in Sahaja Yoga it is a becoming,

01:21:24.651 --> 01:21:26.731
It is not just to come and fill in a form,

01:21:26.931 --> 01:21:31.541
"All right, you are the member", or you pay supposing a one-pound, a membership fees.

01:21:31.541 --> 01:21:35.411
It's not that! It's your becoming, what you become!

01:21:35.411 --> 01:21:39.771
It's your thing, that must happen. You must get your properties.

01:21:39.771 --> 01:21:43.065
This is the problem.

01:21:46.371 --> 01:21:49.439
You have to give up a little bit.

01:21:49.439 --> 01:21:52.546
It's easy to give up.

01:21:53.731 --> 01:21:56.491
It's very easy but I never talk about it before Realization,

01:21:56.691 --> 01:21:58.651
because after Realization, you just give up.

01:21:58.851 --> 01:22:00.411
If I tell you, half of you might go away,

01:22:00.411 --> 01:22:02.721
so I'm not going to tell you.

01:22:02.721 --> 01:22:05.598
You'd better get your Realization. It will work it out.

01:22:05.598 --> 01:22:08.851
It will establish a new priority within yourself, naturally.

01:22:08.851 --> 01:22:11.860
Because if you have light you see.

01:22:12.491 --> 01:22:14.851
You see snake as snake and rope as rope.

01:22:15.651 --> 01:22:19.952
So, I don't have to tell you,
you just see it, you just feel it, it happens to you.

01:22:20.611 --> 01:22:22.651
Yes, I know, I know. I wish I could.

01:22:22.851 --> 01:22:26.286
It can be done to all the new people,

01:22:26.286 --> 01:22:28.841
whatever race you may belong; it can.

01:22:28.841 --> 01:22:31.667
But how many are there?

01:22:32.851 --> 01:22:34.651
It's a very slow movement.

01:22:34.851 --> 01:22:39.001
For four years, I had only seven Britons with me.

01:22:39.001 --> 01:22:44.812
I was struggling with them. Four years, can you imagine? In England.

01:22:48.651 --> 01:22:50.754
It's tremendous task.

01:22:51.851 --> 01:22:54.451
All right. So, you get your Realization now.

01:22:54.451 --> 01:22:56.860
Let's see how many you bring in.

01:22:58.691 --> 01:22:59.771
Yes?

01:23:00.771 --> 01:23:05.899
Divine Holy Mother, after Self-realization,

01:23:05.899 --> 01:23:09.297
how long it takes for a new [unclear]

01:23:09.297 --> 01:23:12.929
is it possible to stop reincarnating and seek perfection?

01:23:13.451 --> 01:23:17.611
Is it easy? Last, what did he say? What d'you say?

01:23:20.851 --> 01:23:23.891
Is it easy to? Last sentence, what do you say?

01:23:24.371 --> 01:23:27.651
I was saying after Realization, is it possible

01:23:27.851 --> 01:23:30.651
to stop reincarnating

01:23:30.851 --> 01:23:35.651
and to be perfect in these troubled times?

01:23:35.851 --> 01:23:40.256
You are reincarnated by Self-realization itself.

01:23:41.851 --> 01:23:44.371
And to stop having rebirth and birth?

01:23:44.571 --> 01:23:47.531
You don't think of these things afterwards.

01:23:47.531 --> 01:23:53.066
Because you are not futuristic anymore. You live in the present.

01:23:54.571 --> 01:23:56.611
You see these ideas of rebirth and

01:23:56.811 --> 01:23:59.451
this frightening stuff: you should not have rebirth.

01:23:59.691 --> 01:24:00.912
Why not?

01:24:02.491 --> 01:24:07.011
I mean, you create a beautiful house, everything,

01:24:07.491 --> 01:24:11.405
and then you say that you don't live in it?

01:24:11.851 --> 01:24:16.771
When you become a rich man, you want to enjoy your wealth isn't it?

01:24:16.771 --> 01:24:19.651
But they're not Buddha's saying:

01:24:19.851 --> 01:24:22.651
birth is suffering, death is suffering.

01:24:22.851 --> 01:24:26.371
Yes, that's true, but not Realization.

01:24:32.731 --> 01:24:34.931
You see, what he has said is:

01:24:35.491 --> 01:24:37.491
Buddha never asked you to

01:24:37.491 --> 01:24:41.928
to limit your desire of ascent.

01:24:41.928 --> 01:24:43.611
Because people talk of God, once

01:24:43.811 --> 01:24:46.971
they talked of it in India but nobody talked of the deities.

01:24:46.971 --> 01:24:50.491
That was a problem, because it became a talk again.

01:24:50.491 --> 01:24:55.411
Then they talked of a God which was abstract,

01:24:55.411 --> 01:24:59.048
like you can say, Jehova and other things,

01:24:59.377 --> 01:25:03.851
because they wanted people to get over their

01:25:03.851 --> 01:25:08.491
stuck-up points you see. Nothing worked you see.

01:25:08.491 --> 01:25:13.023
So Buddha said, "All right, let's talk only about
the Self-realization, nothing else. Not even of God.

01:25:13.075 --> 01:25:18.366
Let's talk of that.
Let people get to Self-realization, then we'll talk about God.

01:25:19.451 --> 01:25:23.558
So, he said, "All right. Only Self-realization. No God, nothing."

01:25:23.891 --> 01:25:28.157
That was his job. Fix you up with the idea of Self-realization.

01:25:28.491 --> 01:25:32.531
He said, "Dont' worship anything, don't worship, get your Self-realization.

01:25:32.531 --> 01:25:38.210
They are worshipping everything under the sun, these Buddists!

01:25:38.851 --> 01:25:41.694
What am I to do?

01:25:44.034 --> 01:25:50.118
So whatever Buddha has said,
everything is re-said in Sahaja Yoga.

01:25:52.771 --> 01:25:54.771
“Buddham sharanam gachami.”

01:25:55.811 --> 01:25:59.565
I surrender myself to the enlightened One.

01:25:59.851 --> 01:26:04.458
The One which is enlightened is your Spirit.

01:26:05.691 --> 01:26:07.811
“Sangham sharanam gachami,”

01:26:08.011 --> 01:26:10.895
I surrender myself to the collectivity.

01:26:10.895 --> 01:26:13.678
Unless and until you are a collectively conscious person,

01:26:13.678 --> 01:26:15.967
how can you surrender?

01:26:17.491 --> 01:26:21.503
Buddha also, whatever he said,
is not understood before Realization. You cannot.

01:26:21.503 --> 01:26:23.996
“Dharmam sharanam gachami,”

01:26:23.996 --> 01:26:26.020
is the sustanance within us.

01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:28.571
'Sharanam' means you become that.

01:26:28.571 --> 01:26:31.331
It's not a mental thing, "Oh, I surrender myself".

01:26:31.531 --> 01:26:34.339
But you just become.

01:26:36.571 --> 01:26:38.651
You become the enlightened one.

01:26:38.851 --> 01:26:41.541
You become the collectively conscious.

01:26:41.541 --> 01:26:45.590
You become the dharma, the sustenance, the religion within us.

01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:47.590
You become!

01:26:47.851 --> 01:26:49.651
That's what he meant.

01:26:49.851 --> 01:26:54.060
But for them, 'Sharanam gachami' means take a wheel in the hand, go on

01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:56.731
"Buddham sharanam gachami".

01:26:56.731 --> 01:27:01.161
Now. What this wheel is going to do, I just don't understand, you know.

01:27:01.811 --> 01:27:04.331
They'll go on hours together, they'll go mad.

01:27:04.531 --> 01:27:07.691
They will end up into lunatic asylum, beieve me.

01:27:08.851 --> 01:27:12.371
Or like mad you have to say something, all the time praying.

01:27:12.371 --> 01:27:15.411
Is that the way you are becoming?

01:27:15.851 --> 01:27:20.001
They don't even know where is Buddha placed into yourself.

01:27:24.851 --> 01:27:28.252
But Sahaja Yogis know where he is placed

01:27:28.252 --> 01:27:30.122
and how to please him.

01:27:30.531 --> 01:27:37.375
Whatever he said is nothing but Sahaja Yoga, absolutely 100%

01:27:40.811 --> 01:27:46.366
Actually, Buddha was nobody else but an Incarnation,

01:27:46.366 --> 01:27:49.590
who reincarnated himself as Adi Shankaracharya.

01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:51.503
You can see it clearly in your being,

01:27:51.503 --> 01:27:53.331
it can be proved on Kundalini again!

01:27:53.331 --> 01:27:56.304
You see, how can I prove it?

01:27:59.851 --> 01:28:02.651
To understand them, first you get your Realization.

01:28:02.851 --> 01:28:07.097
Again, I am talking like Buddha only.

01:28:09.331 --> 01:28:14.120
He tried something
by which he thought people will take to Realization.

01:28:14.851 --> 01:28:17.316
But human beings as they are...

01:28:18.411 --> 01:28:20.611
He thought they are very much involved in materialism,

01:28:20.811 --> 01:28:23.851
take them out, try this, try that. Nothing works out.

01:28:24.411 --> 01:28:26.531
Nothing.

01:28:26.531 --> 01:28:31.609
Only thing that works out: the real happening, nothing else.

01:28:36.771 --> 01:28:39.506
Mother, you are [inaudible]?

01:28:39.851 --> 01:28:41.371
What's it?

01:28:42.851 --> 01:28:45.721
Say it loudly.

01:28:50.651 --> 01:28:53.606
All right?

01:28:55.851 --> 01:28:59.731
Is there somebody else saying something which I didn't hear?

01:28:59.931 --> 01:29:03.771
Today, the vibrations are so much that really, to be very franck,

01:29:04.811 --> 01:29:06.291
you can't imagine!

01:29:06.503 --> 01:29:08.663
I don't know how I'm listening to you, what you are talking.

01:29:08.851 --> 01:29:11.451
