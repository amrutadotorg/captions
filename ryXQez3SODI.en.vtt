00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880
Okay, it was the last time Shrimataji came to Switzerland.

2
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:18.080
She was going to China to give her speech at the Women's Conference.

3
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.920
And she was coming straight from Kabela and taking the plane in Zurich to go to China,

4
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:33.720
except that the plane from Milan was delayed and the Swissair plane didn't wait for her

5
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.720
and left.

6
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.720
So she had to stay one night in Zurich to go the following day.

7
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.600
We were following her from Kabela.

8
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.280
So we had, you know, when you go to Kabela, you take two or three saris plus the clothes

9
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.860
for those number of days that you're going to stay there.

10
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:58.660
So we had no, I had no more fresh saris, all had been used.

11
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:07.620
I had just a Punjabi dress, a red one, embroidered in yellow, goldish color.

12
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.420
Very, very nice, but still.

13
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.740
So we were in the evening looking after Shrimataji in her room.

14
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.100
It was just a very small group of people who had followed her.

15
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.340
So we were at maximum 10 people.

16
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.340
And the following morning, so the only fresh clothes that I still had was this Punjabi

17
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.340
dress.

18
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:38.360
So I put it on because you get up, have your shower and put your clean clothes.

19
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.900
So I was wearing it.

20
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.180
But I thought, well, a married lady should go in front of Shrimataji wearing a sari.

21
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.700
So I'm not going to enter her room this morning.

22
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.820
So because I'm not in a sari.

23
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.260
So I stayed doing all the back, you know, in the back, doing whatever you have to, but

24
00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.440
without going into her room.

25
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:07.740
And then all of a sudden, someone opened the door of the living room of her suite.

26
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.260
And I was just behind and wasn't expecting that that door was going to be open.

27
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.300
Someone opened it from inside and she was just in front.

28
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.580
And she said, oh, hello, Maria-Melia, come in.

29
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.460
I said, oh, my goodness, but I'm not properly dressed.

30
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.660
But I didn't say anything.

31
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.140
I just went in.

32
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.140
Then she looked at me.

33
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.300
She smiled and she said, what a beautiful outfit you are wearing.

34
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.740
Come let me see it.

35
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.260
So I went next to her.

36
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.260
She took it in her hands.

37
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.380
She was saying, what a nice fabric.

38
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.580
When did you buy it?

39
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.020
And all this sort of thing.

40
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.020
It's beautiful.

41
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.420
So it's really it was red, very strong red and yellow, golden color.

42
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.260
And then I smiled because I said, OK, you have to have the right attitude.

43
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.880
You're going to meet the goddess.

44
00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:03.980
So you wear as a married lady, you have your sari, you'll be properly with the proper attire.

45
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.860
But so the attitude has to be good.

46
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.180
But if you but she understands and she knows.

47
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.700
So she was the one calling me in and admiring what I was wearing, even if it was not a beautiful

48
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.540
sari to be in front of her.

49
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.500
So that's exactly the other way around.

50
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.380
But it was a nice story because she and I was ever so happy.

51
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.500
Can imagine.

52
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.500
But well, that was it.

53
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.140
Yeah, it's still your heart was in the right place.

54
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.140
Yeah.

55
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.140
Yeah.

56
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.140
Yeah.

57
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.140
Yeah.

58
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.140
It's a lovely story.

59
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.140
Lovely story.
