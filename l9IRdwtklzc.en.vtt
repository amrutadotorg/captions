WEBVTT

00:05.950 --> 00:10.960
Guru Puja. Cabella Ligure, July16th 1995

04:22.008 --> 04:32.135
It is a very important Guru Puja today

04:32.336 --> 04:41.616
because we have completed twenty-five
years of Guru Puja.

04:47.140 --> 04:50.871
(Hindi: "Please put the fan in the rotating
manner".)

05:15.188 --> 05:23.855
Also, it is extremely beautiful

05:24.056 --> 05:36.483
to see so many Sahaja Yogis who are,
really have become, very great.

05:39.030 --> 05:47.277
It’s a question of understanding what
Sahaja Yoga is.

05:47.478 --> 05:52.300
It's a very unique discovery, I feel now,

05:52.501 --> 06:02.303
that people who were seeking the Truth
have found it

06:02.504 --> 06:13.053
and have now got it absolutely on their
central nervous system.

06:14.668 --> 06:18.278
Yes, in some places it’s difficult to
explain

06:18.479 --> 06:21.866
how it has happened, how it has worked out

06:22.067 --> 06:26.666
and how, in these twenty-five years, we
have been able

06:26.867 --> 06:33.321
to achieve this expansion of Sahaja Yoga.

06:36.571 --> 06:45.037
The main thing, I feel, is that you all
should know

06:45.255 --> 06:51.820
that as the tree grows, the roots have
to grow much deeper

06:52.021 --> 06:57.126
and they should spread also. If it doesn't
happen,

06:57.327 --> 07:03.105
the tree cannot be sustained only by Mother
Earth.

07:03.306 --> 07:10.947
So the roots are in your own life, in your
own heart.

07:14.785 --> 07:18.366
When we say we have become our own Guru,

07:18.567 --> 07:24.477
we should really try to find out with our
introspection:

07:24.678 --> 07:29.327
Are we our Guru or not?

07:30.186 --> 07:36.646
Because, before this your mind was on one
side

07:36.847 --> 07:46.692
and your heart was on another side

07:46.893 --> 07:52.438
and your attention was in another
dimension.

07:52.639 --> 07:59.198
So these three things were creating
confusion within you.

08:07.573 --> 08:14.612
If you understand a human being, then you
will be surprised to see

08:14.813 --> 08:23.271
how these three things act separately in a
human being. And sometimes they fight also.

08:23.472 --> 08:27.620
First is your intellect and your mind.

08:27.821 --> 08:34.612
Second is your heart, your feelings, your
emotions.

08:42.607 --> 08:51.021
And the third one is your attention.

08:52.829 --> 08:58.698
In these modern times, this confusion is
the worst

08:58.899 --> 09:03.247
because all the time your attention is
outside.

09:03.448 --> 09:10.288
It could be towards beautiful things, or
beautiful women, or beautiful men or

09:10.489 --> 09:16.917
all kinds of nonsensical way of wasting
your energy.

09:17.118 --> 09:23.179
Such attention then is absolutely like
a horse which is let loose.

09:23.380 --> 09:26.442
You cannot control such an attention.

09:26.643 --> 09:34.530
And this attention runs wild from one
to another.

09:34.935 --> 09:38.597
It’s a fashion also. It’s sort of a very
popular thing

09:38.798 --> 09:43.059
to keep the attention moving all the time.

09:43.260 --> 09:49.102
But this attention that has to be towards
the Divine,

09:49.303 --> 09:57.612
towards the Almighty, is just being
frittered away.

09:57.813 --> 10:04.604
Thus, attention doesn’t grow its own roots.

10:06.278 --> 10:11.766
First is to find out about yourself: where
does your attention go?

10:11.967 --> 10:24.691
What makes you feel like looking after or
concerned for attention?

10:24.892 --> 10:29.695
You see, the attention comes from various
problems,

10:29.896 --> 10:40.263
and could be your upbringing where you are
not controlled,

10:44.490 --> 10:54.482
could be your education, could be your
atmosphere in which you live

10:54.683 --> 11:00.455
or could be your own ego or your
conditioning.

11:02.577 --> 11:07.094
(Hindi: "The water is maybe a bit too cold,
that's why.

11:15.571 --> 11:21.633
What is it, tea? Is it hot?

11:22.648 --> 11:26.652
Pour it here, I'll drink it.

11:36.662 --> 11:39.005
That's fine".)

11:42.871 --> 11:50.912
So, this attention is being attacked

11:51.443 --> 12:03.061
by all these outside energies or negative
forces

12:03.391 --> 12:10.640
and it gets entangled - like a river
flowing

12:10.841 --> 12:20.012
straight into the ocean can get lost
in a barren place.

12:20.213 --> 12:29.916
In the same way this attention, which has
to go towards the Divine,

12:30.117 --> 12:34.215
gets frittered away and is vanished...

12:34.416 --> 12:40.739
This weak attention cannot take you towards
the Divine.

12:40.940 --> 12:47.679
Ultimately you find that all this attention
is being completely

12:48.373 --> 12:55.413
absorbed or frittered away by the nonsense
that’s going on.

12:55.614 --> 13:01.077
Unfortunately or fortunately, you are born
in these modern times,

13:01.278 --> 13:06.429
and in these modern times, as you know,
it's a very chaotic condition.

13:06.630 --> 13:11.630
In these chaotic conditions, you don’t know
what is right and what is wrong.

13:11.831 --> 13:17.208
And there are all kinds of attractions,

13:17.409 --> 13:26.324
which can take away your attention and
reduce the energy of your attention.

13:27.456 --> 13:34.998
It is possible more for the people who are
very right-sided.

13:35.199 --> 13:38.957
Also the left-sided people can be very much
affected.

13:39.158 --> 13:44.765
Right-sided people, as you know, go up to
a point and become extremely dry,

13:44.966 --> 13:52.366
self-opinionated and aggressive. All their
attention is in aggression,

13:52.567 --> 13:58.654
while the people who are on the left side
are indulging too much

13:58.855 --> 14:06.253
into their own whims and their desires and
their own temptations.

14:06.454 --> 14:10.602
Both sides can fritter away your attention

14:10.803 --> 14:17.570
which is the most important thing. It is
the most valuable thing is your attention.

14:17.771 --> 14:22.399
But the attention cannot be controlled by
a person

14:22.600 --> 14:30.311
who doesn't have a weak mind or a weak
heart.

14:30.512 --> 14:35.287
Now supposing you take somebody who is
a very intelligent person.

14:35.488 --> 14:39.528
The intelligent person puts all his
attention

14:39.729 --> 14:43.835
in capturing the attention of others.

14:44.036 --> 14:48.713
I don't know why, but it’s a kind of
a paradox.

14:48.914 --> 14:58.862
The person who himself is having such a lot
of aggressiveness and all that,

14:59.063 --> 15:03.232
tries to be very sweet, tries to be very
nice with people

15:03.433 --> 15:11.967
just to keep good relations or, we can say,
the good behavior

15:12.168 --> 15:17.265
towards people so that they pay attention
to that person.

15:17.466 --> 15:21.415
This is a very subtle thing. They are not
even aware about it,

15:21.616 --> 15:29.553
that we do such a thing just to make others
pay attention to us.

15:29.754 --> 15:33.357
That is how we have seen that in these
modern times

15:33.558 --> 15:39.246
so many stupid things people do just
to attract the attention of others.

15:39.447 --> 15:48.227
Most of the fads that had come up in modern
times

15:48.428 --> 15:56.563
are just to make something stupid so that
people should pay attention to them.

15:58.614 --> 16:03.748
Of course, the Sahaja Yogis are not like
that. But I am just pointing it out

16:03.949 --> 16:07.028
how, in the modern times, you have to be
very careful

16:07.229 --> 16:13.740
that you should not try to attract
the attention of others.

16:13.941 --> 16:19.123
Instead of that, what you have to do is
to pay attention to others

16:19.324 --> 16:23.644
in a very subtle way, not with any
expectation

16:23.845 --> 16:25.791
that if you are paying attention to
somebody,

16:25.992 --> 16:31.191
that person should pay attention to you.
It’s a very big struggle,

16:31.392 --> 16:39.510
I’ve seen, in Sahaja Yoga also, that people
try to, say, become very popular

16:39.711 --> 16:47.773
or become very outstanding, or something
of a very great qualities,

16:47.974 --> 16:52.501
to show off that they are something better
than others.

16:52.702 --> 16:58.178
A person who is really in connection with
the Divine, is least bothered

16:58.379 --> 17:03.364
about how people pay attention to that
person,

17:03.565 --> 17:10.140
but automatically the attention of such
a person is on others,

17:10.341 --> 17:13.555
which is very, very subtle, very subtle.

17:13.756 --> 17:17.788
You cannot make out that the attention
of such a person

17:17.989 --> 17:23.987
is on you, but it works and it works
beautifully.

17:24.188 --> 17:29.589
We have to understand that we have now come
to the realm of the Divinity.

17:29.790 --> 17:34.686
We are in the Kingdom of God and we are
divine people.

17:34.887 --> 17:39.205
We are very powerful people, but if we
fritter away

17:39.406 --> 17:43.165
our attention, we become very, very weak
people.

17:43.366 --> 17:49.162
It's easy to feel that, “we are Sahaja
Yogis”, “we have done

17:49.350 --> 17:55.439
so much of realisation of others” or
“we have helped so many people.”

17:55.640 --> 17:59.499
All this consciousness if it comes within
you, then know

17:59.700 --> 18:03.829
that you are still not fully developed
Sahaja Yogis.

18:04.030 --> 18:09.926
There should be no consciousness of what
you are doing or what you are committing.

18:10.127 --> 18:18.198
There is no need to boast about it. There
is no need to advertise it.

18:18.399 --> 18:22.716
Whatever you are, is already, can be seen
by everyone.

18:22.917 --> 18:26.664
But even that desire is not needed

18:26.865 --> 18:32.879
because you are doing just for
the satisfaction of your Spirit.

18:33.970 --> 18:37.826
So then, when we come to our heart:

18:38.027 --> 18:41.562
in the heart resides the Spirit, as you
know very well.

18:41.763 --> 18:49.474
Now, when it is the heart, which has
to work over your brain and which can work,

18:49.675 --> 18:54.334
what becomes of you is nothing, but you
become a source

18:54.535 --> 18:57.892
of love and compassion. A source, I am
saying.

18:58.093 --> 19:03.762
You do not assert on others. You do not say
that, “I’ve done so much for you

19:03.963 --> 19:13.126
and what are you doing to me? What is this
that I should have so much expressed,

19:13.327 --> 19:16.114
in so many ways, and here you are,

19:16.315 --> 19:20.691
you are forgetting me and not doing
anything for me?”

19:20.892 --> 19:26.397
So the expectation of reward if it is
there,

19:26.598 --> 19:30.849
then you must know is your mind which is
giving you these ideas

19:31.050 --> 19:37.639
and is working it out that way that you
just now put attention

19:37.840 --> 19:41.572
to the amount of love the other person
has given you

19:41.773 --> 19:49.173
for whatever you have given to another
person. It's very subtle.

19:51.622 --> 19:58.337
So in Sahaja Yoga, you should see now
yourself as just a source of love,

19:58.538 --> 20:02.478
which is just flowing.

20:02.679 --> 20:08.033
In that, you do not say that you have
to have this or that,

20:08.234 --> 20:15.624
or you have to achieve this goal, or you
have to become that. It's finished now.

20:15.825 --> 20:22.700
Once you have become the source, then how
can you become something?

20:22.901 --> 20:28.919
The thing is, those who are receiving from
the source want to have

20:29.120 --> 20:40.880
some sort of a reward or some sort of
a recognition.

20:41.081 --> 20:47.291
In this subtle way if you move, your mind
is very clever.

20:47.492 --> 20:52.418
In Sahaja Yoga, we have very clever,
intelligent people.

20:52.619 --> 21:00.244
But this mind... You have to be very
careful because this mind can cheat you.

21:02.160 --> 21:06.857
So ask your mind, "Why are you in Sahaja
Yoga?

21:07.058 --> 21:11.623
What is the purpose of your Sahaja Yoga?"

21:12.948 --> 21:21.227
Gradually this mind will shut up. And then,
you have to ask yourself that,

21:21.428 --> 21:29.752
"What is my own desire now? What do I want?

21:29.953 --> 21:36.556
What do I want to achieve? Why I am
in Sahaja Yoga?"

21:37.302 --> 21:41.481
If you ask this question, you will see
you’ll just dissolve,

21:41.682 --> 21:46.963
you'll become thoughtless because there is
no desire left now.

21:47.164 --> 21:50.851
There is no ambition left, no competition.

21:51.052 --> 21:56.299
All these qualities are of the brain, or we
can say, of the intellect,

21:56.500 --> 22:01.909
which makes you competitive, which makes
you also jealous.

22:02.110 --> 22:06.160
So jealousy is also a product of this
competitiveness

22:06.361 --> 22:10.939
because when two persons are competing
or many are competing

22:11.140 --> 22:15.147
and one is selected, others become jealous.

22:15.348 --> 22:21.150
I mean, instead of feeling happy, "All
right. So, one of us has become something,

22:21.351 --> 22:23.608
so we should be very happy that he has
become."

22:23.809 --> 22:29.219
On the contrary, the other people feel
jealous, "Why has he become?

22:29.420 --> 22:33.616
Who is he? What does he think of himself?"
Then they go further.

22:33.817 --> 22:38.470
Not you people, but on the whole, people
go further with it

22:38.671 --> 22:44.044
and what do they do is to harm another
person.

22:44.996 --> 22:50.193
In Sahaja Yoga, people are also sometimes
very worried and frightened.

22:50.394 --> 22:53.255
There is no need to be worried or
frightened

22:53.456 --> 23:00.594
because now you have become a Sahaja
Yogi and a Guru. Nobody can touch you.

23:00.795 --> 23:06.844
Anybody who tries to touch you will be
subsided, somehow or other.

23:07.045 --> 23:13.125
Of course, I don't do anything as such.
But today only I heard that in Turkey

23:13.326 --> 23:19.786
there were two newspapers who were after
Sahaja Yoga, writing all nonsensical things.

23:19.987 --> 23:26.915
So, the first one met with an accident and
died. I didn't do that.

23:27.116 --> 23:32.341
The second one had two people, editor
and sub-editor,

23:32.542 --> 23:38.248
were killed and somebody cut their throats.
Of course, I didn't do that.

23:38.449 --> 23:41.181
Some fundamentalist must have done, or
somebody must have done.

23:41.382 --> 23:46.455
Now, we don't have to worry as to who
criticizes you, they say it about you

23:46.656 --> 23:49.430
because you must know they are blind
people.

23:49.631 --> 23:55.576
They are absolutely blind, they are not
matured as far as the wisdom is concerned.

23:55.777 --> 23:59.592
For them to understand Sahaja Yoga is not
possible.

23:59.793 --> 24:03.150
They go up to a point and then they stop.
They cannot go further

24:03.351 --> 24:06.390
because this dissolution of your being,

24:06.591 --> 24:12.772
as I said, “the drop becomes the ocean”.

24:13.265 --> 24:18.125
It's difficult, specially in the West,
where there are so many ideas

24:18.326 --> 24:26.300
of their own identifications and of their
own personalities.

24:27.404 --> 24:34.003
Now, it is quite, again, a paradox that we
don’t want people

24:34.204 --> 24:41.063
to dress up indecently or we don’t want
people to behave indecently.

24:41.264 --> 24:45.781
Decency is a very big part of Sahaja Yoga.

24:45.982 --> 24:51.223
So one can ask that, "Mother, when you say
you have to completely dissolve,

24:51.424 --> 24:54.526
then why should we have this dignity?

24:54.727 --> 24:58.144
Why should we worry about having
the dignity?" It's quite all right.

24:58.345 --> 25:01.555
This question is all right. The answer is
like this:

25:01.756 --> 25:14.309
Supposing, you put a drop of some filth in
the ocean, then the ocean can become dirty.

25:14.510 --> 25:19.695
If you put some poison, then the whole
ocean can become poisonous.

25:19.896 --> 25:26.663
In the same way, whatever is not congenial
to the ocean,

25:26.864 --> 25:31.299
to this Divine power, should not be done.

25:31.500 --> 25:37.835
Otherwise, you will spoil the whole of it.
We have had experiences.

25:38.036 --> 25:41.956
We have had Sahaja Yogis who were leaders
also,

25:42.157 --> 25:47.964
and they tried to be quite funny and
the whole collectivity was spoilt.

25:48.165 --> 25:54.339
One person who is not a good person can
spoil the whole collectivity.

25:54.540 --> 26:01.645
The one who is then a leader, on top
of that, is even worse.

26:01.846 --> 26:07.816
So, one has to understand that, when you
are becoming a drop of the ocean,

26:08.017 --> 26:13.689
this ocean is the pure ocean of love.

26:13.890 --> 26:19.809
In that you should not do something that
will create repulsion, frustration,

26:20.010 --> 26:29.423
or even sometimes it can create a very
grotesque image of the whole ocean.

26:29.624 --> 26:34.368
That is why we have to be decent people,
decorous people.

26:34.569 --> 26:41.721
It is not that in any way we want you to be
like a dandy people or anything,

26:41.922 --> 26:47.280
but what it means that you must respect
your body, respect yourself

26:47.481 --> 26:51.652
and a respectable personality you should
have.

26:51.853 --> 26:54.865
Too much indulgence to that is not proper,

26:55.066 --> 26:59.379
but it should be such that you should
respect yourself.

26:59.580 --> 27:03.036
It's very important. If you cannot respect
yourself

27:03.237 --> 27:09.244
you cannot respect at all the Divinity
within you.

27:09.445 --> 27:15.328
It's like a decoration of the Divinity that
your whole behavior,

27:15.529 --> 27:20.366
your whole attire has to be in such a way
that people should know

27:20.567 --> 27:23.372
that he is a decent man.

27:23.573 --> 27:30.192
Indecent things have come out and have
become now an everyday fashion.

27:30.393 --> 27:34.108
And they go on coming one after another
because of the entrepreneurs,

27:34.309 --> 27:36.667
and we are playing into the hands
of entrepreneurs.

27:36.868 --> 27:39.889
But if you know what dress you have to wear

27:40.090 --> 27:43.762
and what is good for you, once for all you
have to decide.

27:43.963 --> 27:47.296
Now the attention should not be also wasted

27:47.497 --> 27:50.646
in that, "I will today, I'll wear this kind
of a sari,

27:50.847 --> 27:53.827
tomorrow I’ll wear that kind of a dress,
third day…",

27:54.028 --> 27:59.196
because that also spoils the attention.
But if it is a decent thing,

27:59.397 --> 28:02.956
it's perfectly alright, and that will
really make you feel

28:03.157 --> 28:06.661
dignified within yourself.

28:06.862 --> 28:09.644
In modern times, as the people are, I don't
think

28:09.845 --> 28:13.264
they have much respect for themselves.

28:13.899 --> 28:17.399
You see very highly posted people, highly
placed people

28:17.600 --> 28:21.553
doing all kinds of nonsensical things like
cheating,

28:21.754 --> 28:32.310
like having relations with people who are
of dishonorable position.

28:32.511 --> 28:35.595
All this is happening. If you see
in the newspaper, you are shocked

28:35.796 --> 28:39.943
how these people at the helm of affairs
could be like this.

28:40.144 --> 28:45.034
Because they are still not matured enough
to know where are they,

28:45.235 --> 28:48.031
what is their position, how they have
to be.

28:48.232 --> 28:52.463
If you are matured enough then you will
understand that, say, I’m a housewife,

28:52.664 --> 28:57.639
I’m such a minister, I’m prime-minister,
how I should be.

28:57.840 --> 29:03.647
That all that achievement they have outside
remains outside, doesn't go inside.

29:03.848 --> 29:07.667
But for a Sahaja Yogi it should be absorbed
within.

29:07.868 --> 29:15.466
It has to be absorbed within so that
the attention is not wasted too much.

29:17.038 --> 29:22.747
The another part which one has to see is
the heart.

29:23.683 --> 29:32.083
Some people are saying, "Mother, if our
heart is ruling the head,

29:32.284 --> 29:37.358
then we become too much emotional, we get
too much attached to people,

29:37.559 --> 29:45.954
we get, you see, sort of individual
friendships and things like that."

29:46.155 --> 29:52.176
On this point, one has to know that why do
you get attached to one person?

29:52.377 --> 29:58.898
It’s not your heart. It’s not your heart.
You get attached to a person

29:59.099 --> 30:06.900
because you have some sort of a, we can
say, a relationship, maybe.

30:07.101 --> 30:11.148
Or maybe, you like the hair-dress of that
person.

30:11.349 --> 30:15.628
Maybe, you like the dress that person has.

30:15.829 --> 30:21.144
Something outside quality is attracting you
towards that person.

30:21.345 --> 30:25.079
It is not something inner quality that is
attracting.

30:25.280 --> 30:30.806
For example, if you are attached to your
children too much, you will spoil them.

30:31.007 --> 30:35.896
They will not come up to your expectations.
Anybody you get attached to,

30:36.097 --> 30:42.547
you must verify, why are you attached
to such a person, what is the reason?

30:42.748 --> 30:48.160
Now, in Sahaja Yoga people are attached
to each other very much, I know that.

30:48.361 --> 30:53.853
But it is not for any external reason.
Because somebody is rich,

30:54.054 --> 30:57.470
because somebody is famous, because
somebody is doing

30:57.654 --> 31:02.596
some sort of a extraordinary work. No.

31:02.797 --> 31:11.392
They are attached to that person because
that person is a bundle of vibrations,

31:11.593 --> 31:16.561
that it gives you tranquillity, it gives
you joy and it gives you

31:16.762 --> 31:24.331
a kind of an immense dissolution of your
being.

31:24.532 --> 31:28.616
So, that happens when you are very much
there,

31:28.817 --> 31:34.734
as I have told you the story of once this
potter

31:34.935 --> 31:43.740
was kneading the clay and his name was
Gorakumhar,

31:43.941 --> 31:47.237
and when Namadeva, who was a tailor,

31:47.438 --> 31:53.512
but very well known poet, both of them
were poets, he went and he saw

31:53.713 --> 32:00.735
this potter was doing such a, I mean, it was
not a very respectable work he was doing,

32:00.936 --> 32:08.707
he was busy kneading the clay, he looked
at him and what he says that,

32:08.908 --> 32:17.739
"I have come here to see the Chaitanya,
to see the formless.

32:17.940 --> 32:24.991
But what I find that the formless has got
into a form."

32:25.192 --> 32:31.470
This only, I always say, is only possible
between the two Saints of the same level.

32:31.671 --> 32:36.023
That the way they appreciate, that the way
they feel -

32:36.224 --> 32:40.392
there are no words for what I want to say -
but the way they feel

32:40.593 --> 32:46.346
the oneness, the unity, which is a subtle
one between each other.

32:46.547 --> 32:53.220
Such a feeling if you have for each other,
then know that you are

32:53.421 --> 32:58.123
really now dissolved and you are in
the ocean of joy.

32:58.324 --> 33:04.026
But on the contrary, those who are sitting
on the shores cannot feel that way.

33:04.227 --> 33:09.068
They judge, they try to find out what’s
wrong with that person, this is not so.

33:09.269 --> 33:13.918
They can never appreciate another person.
What they feel is that they have a right

33:14.119 --> 33:20.055
to criticize, to find out faults with others
and that they are something special.

33:20.256 --> 33:23.349
And the other person also finds some faults
with this person.

33:23.550 --> 33:27.948
So it’s a fault-finding society I find
sometimes. And you get fed up with it.

33:28.149 --> 33:33.628
But when you see that the another person
who is there,

33:33.829 --> 33:42.895
the person who is another saint, you feel
such rapport, such oneness,

33:43.096 --> 33:49.382
such a spontaneous feeling for that person
which is absolutely pure.

33:49.583 --> 33:55.934
There’s no expectation, there’s no mental
activity to find out

33:56.135 --> 34:03.525
what’s wrong with that person. There’s no
judgment about what he, the person is like,

34:03.706 --> 34:13.825
but just oneness with that person you feel,
and you feel that your quality of your love

34:14.026 --> 34:19.689
has got a new shine, a new dimension.

34:19.999 --> 34:24.426
So it comes to that, what we should
appreciate within ourselves

34:24.627 --> 34:31.157
is the purity of our love. When you are
pure, the purity is there,

34:31.358 --> 34:39.871
you do not get attached to anything, but
in that detachment, you are enjoying.

34:40.072 --> 34:46.102
In attachment you cannot enjoy because
in that

34:46.303 --> 34:54.825
you are bothered more about the superficial
relationship with the other person.

34:55.026 --> 34:58.393
Now, in a wider way, if you see Sahaja
Yoga,

34:58.594 --> 35:07.019
you are all very important people -
extremely important -

35:07.360 --> 35:14.024
because in the history of spirituality there
were not so many saints sitting together.

35:14.225 --> 35:18.317
Never can you see so many people from so
many countries

35:18.518 --> 35:24.264
thinking about Divinity and morality.

35:24.534 --> 35:30.967
It is impossible to get so many people
together, on any point whatsoever,

35:31.168 --> 35:37.615
who are feeling the oneness, the...

35:39.313 --> 35:45.591
you can say, the most soothing feeling
with each other.

35:45.792 --> 35:52.003
Whether it is comfortable or not,

35:52.204 --> 36:02.660
whether it is very much according to
the norms of comfort,

36:02.861 --> 36:11.038
people who are saints are absolutely happy
with other saints

36:11.239 --> 36:17.238
and other saintly people. They rush
to people who are saints.

36:17.439 --> 36:20.815
Once it happened to Me when I was
in Kolhapur

36:21.016 --> 36:25.529
that they told Me, “There is a saint who
talks about You.” “So where is he?”

36:25.730 --> 36:29.591
They said, “He lives up there and it will
take at least three hours

36:29.792 --> 36:33.591
for You to climb up. He only lives there,
he doesn't come out.”

36:33.792 --> 36:36.470
I said, "All right, I would like to go and
see him."

36:36.671 --> 36:42.254
So, I was walking and it started raining.

36:42.455 --> 36:45.470
So they said, "Mother, You never go
to anybody like that,

36:45.671 --> 36:51.997
why are You going to him?" I said, "No,
just I want to go up and see him."

36:52.198 --> 36:56.448
Now, this fellow, they said, had a control
over rain,

36:56.649 --> 37:03.940
but it was raining, raining, raining very
heavily, and when I climbed up

37:04.141 --> 37:09.598
I saw him sitting down and going on like
this with great anger.

37:09.799 --> 37:15.041
So, I said, "Let us go and sit in his cave

37:15.242 --> 37:18.890
because this fellow is now not in a normal
mood."

37:19.091 --> 37:26.229
So, I went and sat in the cave there, and
there he came. He couldn't walk

37:26.430 --> 37:32.579
because his... they say that his legs
became absolutely lame

37:32.780 --> 37:37.363
because of the vibrations that were too
much in him,

37:37.564 --> 37:43.275
whatever it is, he couldn't walk. So, they
brought him there, he sat down.

37:43.476 --> 37:49.199
So, the first thing he asked Me, "Why
did You not allow me to stop the rain?

37:49.400 --> 37:55.518
It was raining so heavily, and when You
were coming up,

37:55.719 --> 38:00.864
I didn’t want You to get drenched the way
now You are all full of water

38:01.073 --> 38:08.394
and I didn’t want You to suffer like this
because it’s not a good welcome to You.

38:08.733 --> 38:15.026
So, did You do it just to control my ego,
because I must have developed ego

38:15.226 --> 38:17.937
because I can control rain, that's a fact?"

38:18.138 --> 38:21.543
So I just smiled at him. I said, "See,

38:21.744 --> 38:26.943
you are My son, isn't it? And you have
bought a sari for Me.

38:27.144 --> 38:30.138
But you are a sannyasi, so I can't take
a sari from you

38:30.339 --> 38:32.385
because sannyasi dharma is different -

38:32.586 --> 38:35.523
I'm a Gruhastha, I can't take a sari from
you.

38:35.724 --> 38:40.051
So, I deliberately got drenched so that you
could give Me a sari."

38:40.252 --> 38:45.875
The whole temper, the whole unnatural
behavior, all dropped out.

38:46.076 --> 38:50.447
He became extremely sweet. "Yes, yes,"
he said, "how do You know I bought a sari?"

38:50.648 --> 38:53.428
"At least," I said, "in love you know
everything."

38:53.629 --> 38:59.268
And then he brought a sari for Me and he
did Aarti and everything.

38:59.469 --> 39:06.749
But, you see, all these things show that
how the love masters everything so easily.

39:06.950 --> 39:14.667
Small, small things, if you are expert
in expressing your love,

39:14.868 --> 39:20.351
how it works out. There are so many
incidents I can give you like this.

39:20.552 --> 39:29.082
But the main thing we have to see within
ourselves, "Do we really love each other?

39:29.283 --> 39:37.455
Do we really have affection and compassion
for others who are not even Sahaja Yogis?"

39:37.656 --> 39:42.706
Those who are not Sahaja Yogis are also
the blind people.

39:42.907 --> 39:47.154
You should have compassion for them.

39:47.355 --> 39:51.787
You should feel that these people are so
unhappy

39:51.988 --> 39:55.495
and they cannot come to Sahaja Yoga

39:55.696 --> 40:01.128
and they cannot become Sahaja Yogis,
and only in their ego they are satisfied.

40:01.329 --> 40:04.773
So, you must have real compassion for them.

40:04.974 --> 40:10.757
If you have this compassion you might be
told by people that,

40:10.958 --> 40:15.389
"Why are you wasting your energy, you are
doing this, you are doing that?"

40:15.590 --> 40:21.338
The compassion is actually, unites all
these things within ourselves.

40:21.539 --> 40:26.171
That’s the uniting factor. First is your
attention,

40:26.372 --> 40:31.284
first,  which is very, very important,
I think.

40:31.485 --> 40:37.084
And the second one is your intellect, or
you can say your mind,

40:37.285 --> 40:44.729
and the third one is your heart. They all
get somehow or other united together

40:44.930 --> 40:48.395
once you have this capacity to have
compassion.

40:48.596 --> 40:51.681
You don't quarrel with Me or anyone, you
don't have to think about it.

40:51.882 --> 40:56.897
You just, you just feel absolutely at home
when you are compassionate

40:57.098 --> 41:01.662
and with this compassion, you are having
relations with others.

41:01.863 --> 41:08.346
Now, this compassion is not studied out
or worked out or maneuvered.

41:08.547 --> 41:14.218
It is just there. It is there. In that
compassion it forgives,

41:14.419 --> 41:16.946
it forgets all nonsensical things.

41:17.147 --> 41:23.759
The forgiveness is only possible if you
have this compassion within you.

41:23.960 --> 41:27.166
Now, even there are Sahaja Yogis who asked
me,

41:27.367 --> 41:30.386
"Mother, how can we have love and
compassion?"

41:30.587 --> 41:35.846
I mean, this is a question which many have
asked me.

41:36.047 --> 41:42.409
Now, the simple thing is that if you
develop your thoughtless awareness

41:42.610 --> 41:46.586
in your meditation, in thoughtless
awareness,

41:46.787 --> 41:50.925
you watch anything in thoughtless
awareness, any relationship you see it

41:51.126 --> 41:55.047
in thoughtless awareness, then you’ll be
amazed

41:55.248 --> 41:59.720
how the gates of this compassion will
open out.

41:59.921 --> 42:03.593
Thoughtless awareness opens your heart,

42:03.794 --> 42:08.070
but it doesn't go to one person or
to another person,

42:08.271 --> 42:13.408
but it is throwing lights on all the sides
of your being.

42:13.609 --> 42:22.733
Everybody is benefited, everybody has
a divine feeling for you.

42:22.934 --> 42:32.210
Because this compassion is not linear,
nor is it aggressive, but it just flows

42:32.411 --> 42:35.855
and smoothes and soothes everything

42:36.056 --> 42:41.920
that is chaotic, that is troublesome and
that is painful.

42:42.121 --> 42:44.479
This is what you have now.

42:44.680 --> 42:47.683
You know, these things were done by saints
long time back.

42:47.884 --> 42:51.536
But then nobody liked them, and they
crucified them - out of jealousy.

42:51.737 --> 42:56.407
Because if somebody became a saint, then
people felt very jealous of that person.

42:56.608 --> 43:00.465
So they killed them or tortured them and
troubled them.

43:00.658 --> 43:05.593
The situation is not so bad now. Of course,
there are some useless people.

43:05.794 --> 43:13.900
There are some people who are really
monsters, I agree. Forget about them.

43:14.101 --> 43:21.113
But on the whole, our attitude should be
that these are blind people.

43:21.314 --> 43:26.175
Now, looking at somebody who is, maybe,
something wrong with that person,

43:26.376 --> 43:30.353
may not be good-natured - may be anything.
But in your heart

43:30.554 --> 43:36.367
you should not have any grudge, you should
not have any complaints about them.

43:36.568 --> 43:42.334
You can talk to that person about it. You
can tell him in a way that will be absorbed,

43:42.535 --> 43:48.049
but you should not try to make an issue
out of it

43:48.250 --> 43:51.345
and try to, in any way, trouble or torture
anyone.

43:51.546 --> 43:57.048
("Can you put off this one?" Hindi: "Put
off the fan".)

44:03.954 --> 44:08.736
You have seen already, in Sahaja Yoga,
those people who came and were troublesome

44:08.937 --> 44:14.597
and were not of any worth for us, just
dropped out by themselves.

44:14.798 --> 44:17.258
We didn't have to do much about it. They
just dropped out

44:17.459 --> 44:24.029
and they have gone into some sort of
a problematic life.

44:24.230 --> 44:27.690
I, even now, receive letters from them
saying that, “We have this problem,

44:27.891 --> 44:31.055
we have that problem and how to solve
this and solve that."

44:31.256 --> 44:35.028
But it’s automatically happening because,
after all,

44:35.229 --> 44:40.941
there is a big choice going on and
the Divine s trying to decide

44:41.142 --> 44:46.554
who are capable of receiving the blessings
of the Divine.

44:46.755 --> 44:49.188
This is the only thing you have to achieve.

44:49.389 --> 44:52.969
That’s why you have come to Sahaja Yoga.
Nothing else is important.

44:53.170 --> 44:58.889
There are people who are very highly
placed, tomorrow they go into dust.

44:59.090 --> 45:03.903
There are people who are regarded as very
great, famous people,

45:04.104 --> 45:09.583
they go into dust. It's all the time is
happening in your presence.

45:09.784 --> 45:14.914
Every day you read a newspaper and you
find how they are behaving.

45:15.115 --> 45:19.997
Like today, somebody told Me that in
the newspaper there was there

45:20.198 --> 45:27.866
that now one bishop is going to discotheque,
can you imagine? He is going to a disco.

45:28.067 --> 45:32.252
Now, what people must be thinking, they
must be breaking their heads,

45:32.453 --> 45:36.901
"Now what to do, this stupid fellow whom
we call as the bishop and everything,

45:37.102 --> 45:40.408
is now going to disco."

45:41.877 --> 45:45.475
What they, I mean, all whatever he had
respect,

45:45.676 --> 45:49.593
maybe it is artificial, but it’s all lost,
finished.

45:49.794 --> 45:56.287
Because you see, as they are, they have
no value of themselves.

45:56.488 --> 46:01.288
They just live with their ego, "I am such
a big man. I am this, that. I am a bishop."

46:01.489 --> 46:04.233
They walk in a different way, they talk
in a different way.

46:04.434 --> 46:07.089
And suddenly how they go down.

46:07.290 --> 46:09.369
Now, what was the need for this old Johnny

46:09.570 --> 46:12.677
to go to the discotheque, I can’t
understand?

46:12.878 --> 46:19.432
So, because of this kind of life that he
is leading, thinking no end of himself,

46:19.633 --> 46:24.423
he could never see that, “One day I will
go down like that.”

46:24.624 --> 46:27.474
Another thing, which you should see
in a very wider way,

46:27.675 --> 46:32.686
that he had no feeling why people respected
him.

46:32.887 --> 46:37.815
He never knew why people had respect
for him.

46:38.045 --> 46:44.820
Or he was not conscious of it. At least
he would have preserved that. He did not.

46:45.021 --> 46:51.464
Why should he go to a place about which
he has been always denouncing

46:51.665 --> 46:57.047
and saying that these are bad places, one
should not go there?

46:58.559 --> 47:05.591
So, in your case, you have to be conscious
that you are Sahaja Yogis.

47:05.792 --> 47:09.611
If you become the ocean doesn't mean that
your consciousness has vanished,

47:09.812 --> 47:15.103
but it has enlarged. You have got
the consciousness of the ocean.

47:15.304 --> 47:21.263
You are not the one who has become like
a mesmerized person

47:21.464 --> 47:26.490
or a person who has no connection with
oneself.

47:26.691 --> 47:32.049
On the contrary, you are connected with
yourself much more than you were before.

47:32.250 --> 47:36.091
So, when you become the ocean you don't
loose your personality,

47:36.292 --> 47:40.191
but you expand your personality. You become
a greater person.

47:40.392 --> 47:45.402
And this is happening in Sahaja Yoga. I am
noticing many people are developing

47:45.603 --> 47:51.567
that kind of a personality, and they are
expressing it and manifesting it.

47:51.768 --> 47:54.561
It gives me great joy to see in My lifetime

47:54.762 --> 48:00.453
I could see such people who are doing this
kind of thing.

48:00.834 --> 48:05.659
So, whenever you are doing something,
whatever is your enterprise,

48:05.860 --> 48:10.675
whatever your lifestyle, whatever it is,
that’s all outside.

48:10.876 --> 48:18.179
One should not lose your attention, which
is towards God Almighty.

48:18.380 --> 48:22.699
If that is lost, you are lost. There is
a very nice poem

48:22.900 --> 48:30.212
Namadeva has written about that there
was a boy who was flying a kite.

48:30.413 --> 48:34.820
And the kite was floating, and this boy was
looking after the kite.

48:35.021 --> 48:40.611
And while he was talking to everybody else,
but his attention was on the kite.

48:40.812 --> 48:47.180
Then it goes further. He says that a lady
is having the little child

48:47.381 --> 48:53.884
on her body, on the waist, and she is
cleaning the house.

48:54.085 --> 49:00.021
She is cleaning with a little broom. She
has to move

49:00.222 --> 49:03.899
from here to there and after that cleaning,
she has to do other work also.

49:04.100 --> 49:09.404
But the child is here. So, her attention is
on the child

49:09.605 --> 49:12.965
that he should not fall down, something
should not happen.

49:13.166 --> 49:17.148
Though she is doing all kinds of work,
everything,

49:17.349 --> 49:22.472
her attention is on the child. In the same
way, your attention should be

49:22.673 --> 49:26.846
on your Divine power of Kundalini.

49:28.738 --> 49:32.413
There’s third one he’s described that there
are many ladies

49:32.614 --> 49:36.664
who are taking water from a river.

49:36.865 --> 49:40.418
Sometimes they have three pitchers on their
heads and walking.

49:40.619 --> 49:43.800
And while they are walking, they are
talking to each other,

49:44.001 --> 49:46.589
they are telling stories about each other
and anything,

49:46.790 --> 49:51.583
but their attention was on the pitchers,
which are on their head.

49:51.784 --> 49:55.400
In the same way, whatever we are doing,
our attention

49:55.601 --> 49:59.329
should be on our Kundalini.

49:59.530 --> 50:05.425
We should find out what are we doing.
As it is we have the light.

50:05.626 --> 50:11.560
But you must take light into every corner
of your life,

50:11.761 --> 50:20.603
every aspect of your thinking, every kind
of an effort you make.

50:20.804 --> 50:25.040
And you’ll be amazed, if you really watch
your attention

50:25.241 --> 50:28.370
you will really know what you are doing.

50:28.571 --> 50:31.529
It’s the attention to be watched so much

50:31.730 --> 50:40.406
that ultimately you’ll be surprised that
the attention is no more frittering away.

50:40.607 --> 50:45.015
Without the attention you cannot work out
Sahaja Yoga.

50:45.216 --> 50:51.748
This is the main problem of Sahaja Yoga,
is that your attention has to be

50:51.949 --> 50:57.021
towards God Almighty. Otherwise, nothing
can work out.

50:57.222 --> 51:00.555
Your ascent cannot work out. Hah, if you
have come to Sahaja Yoga

51:00.756 --> 51:03.572
to make money, all right, you will make
money and get out.

51:03.773 --> 51:06.924
If you have come here to show off your
knowledge and all that,

51:07.125 --> 51:11.127
you will show it and get out. If you have
come here to show

51:11.328 --> 51:17.295
your power and your authority, you stay
there and get out.

51:17.496 --> 51:20.110
Like that many people have gone out if you
know.

51:20.311 --> 51:26.993
And this is what is to be really taken
care of: that you don’t try

51:27.194 --> 51:31.051
to use Sahaja Yoga for all these stupid
things,

51:31.252 --> 51:38.506
which are not permanent, which are not
eternal. Sahaja Yoga is to be used just

51:38.707 --> 51:47.041
for cleansing yourself, for becoming
the ocean, the ocean of love.

51:47.242 --> 51:54.465
Now, many people also feel that love is
rather difficult,

51:54.666 --> 52:01.889
because you can be harmed by others, or
somebody can take advantage of you.

52:02.090 --> 52:09.600
The main thing about love is, if it is not
a pure love, then it creates problems.

52:09.801 --> 52:12.500
Supposing you trust somebody because
of money,

52:12.701 --> 52:15.070
trust somebody because of somebody…
relationship

52:15.271 --> 52:17.951
or anything, and you go on indulging
into it,

52:18.152 --> 52:24.547
ultimately you’ll find that you will be
very disappointed. Very disappointed.

52:24.748 --> 52:33.151
But supposing you show your love, just
with purity about that person...

52:33.352 --> 52:43.251
It’s so subtle. It’s so innate within you,
built in. It’s there.

52:43.452 --> 52:50.615
We have to just open out. Every human being
is a bundle of love.

52:50.900 --> 52:54.423
And when he is afraid of others - specially
in the West,

52:54.624 --> 52:56.600
there is so many ideas they have created

52:56.801 --> 53:02.022
that you are afraid of this kind of love
and that kind of love and

53:02.223 --> 53:05.904
you see the way the perversion and
all nonsense is there.

53:06.105 --> 53:13.155
But in pure love there is a kind of
a beautiful light

53:13.356 --> 53:20.799
which protects you, which guides you and
which enlightens your life completely.

53:21.000 --> 53:32.427
This light is just nourished and also, we
can say, like the lamp has to have the oil,

53:32.628 --> 53:39.824
this is the one that is for our
spirituality: the Love of a person.

53:40.025 --> 53:44.738
You are embodiment of love, take it from
Me, because you are a human being.

53:44.939 --> 53:48.825
Even the animals are there who know what
is love is.

53:49.026 --> 53:56.134
You see… I know that if you love a tiger,
the tiger will never harm.

53:56.335 --> 53:59.010
If you love a snake, it will never harm.

53:59.211 --> 54:05.486
If you try to love anybody who is very
cruel and very bad,

54:05.687 --> 54:11.646
gradually he will calm down. He will harm
you little bit, he will do this,

54:11.847 --> 54:16.507
he will see things and he might be mean
with you, do all kinds of things.

54:16.708 --> 54:20.847
But then, gradually you find your love
works, and works, and works.

54:21.048 --> 54:26.666
And ultimately it is your love, which is
important to that person.

54:26.985 --> 54:32.813
Now, your love is really firstly
appreciated

54:33.014 --> 54:38.674
more by innocent people, like children.
Children know what love is.

54:38.875 --> 54:45.968
If the children see you, and they run away,
that means something wrong with you.

54:46.169 --> 54:50.650
I’ve seen people… like once we were
in Japan

54:50.851 --> 54:55.198
and there were two foreigners who were
there, ladies, who were dressed up -

54:55.393 --> 54:58.167
I don't know from which hair-dresser they
had dressed up themselves

54:58.368 --> 55:04.980
and they were very much overly decorated -
and they came with us, you see.

55:05.181 --> 55:13.244
We climbed up a place to see something
and when we came down

55:13.445 --> 55:18.963
there were some children standing there.
They had gone before us. So they said,

55:19.164 --> 55:23.460
"Where are those witches?” I said, “Which?”
“Which went with you?"

55:23.661 --> 55:26.897
I said, "What do you mean?" "They came,
you know, we were frightened,

55:27.098 --> 55:31.139
we ran away to our houses. Now we have
come to tell you they are witches."

55:31.340 --> 55:33.935
These small, small little Japanese
children, you know,

55:34.136 --> 55:36.769
"They are witches, you know, they are
witches. Be afraid of them."

55:36.970 --> 55:41.265
And they had decorated themselves so much,
so much hair-dressed up.

55:41.466 --> 55:45.224
They have tried to make such a beautiful
show of themselves,

55:45.425 --> 55:49.178
but the… for the children, they were
witches and they ran away.

55:49.379 --> 55:52.515
And when we came, they came running and
telling us, “Don't be with them,

55:52.716 --> 55:55.257
they're witches.”

55:55.458 --> 56:00.285
So, the judgment of the innocent people
is the best judgment.

56:00.486 --> 56:04.748
If they are innocent, they are extremely
well equipped

56:04.949 --> 56:08.791
to judge a person - who has love and who
does not have.

56:08.992 --> 56:13.476
And they are the best people because they
will appreciate you the best.

56:13.677 --> 56:17.846
They will understand that these are people
of some high quality.

56:18.047 --> 56:24.994
But if they are not innocent, cunning,
some people are extremely cunning -

56:25.195 --> 56:28.888
that’s the intelligence part of it - they
can never appreciate you.

56:29.089 --> 56:36.358
They'll appreciate something which is,
something very, very abnormal,

56:36.559 --> 56:42.718
which from divine part, divine angle,

56:42.919 --> 56:52.083
is very, very abtuse and funny. But they
will never appreciate you.

56:52.284 --> 56:55.282
Never, cannot. Up to a point they may,
but may not.

56:55.483 --> 56:59.970
Doesn't matter. You have to appreciate
yourself.

57:00.171 --> 57:06.245
You have to know that you are not unkind
to anyone, you are not judging others,

57:06.446 --> 57:12.908
and that you are appreciating everything
in that person -

57:13.109 --> 57:18.270
whatever is good in him as a human being.
It works.

57:18.471 --> 57:22.966
You have seen, this all has worked through
My love and compassion.

57:23.167 --> 57:28.272
But I’m not conscious that I’m giving you
love or compassion or anything.

57:28.473 --> 57:31.352
I’m not conscious even that I am giving you
anything.

57:31.553 --> 57:39.354
I’m not even conscious as to… I have
created such a lot of beautiful people.

57:39.555 --> 57:42.581
I am not conscious of that. It’s just
happening.

57:42.782 --> 57:46.145
Just like this tree is here, see, it is
not conscious

57:46.346 --> 57:52.168
as to what it is and what it looks like.
It’s just is there.

57:52.369 --> 57:57.959
In the same way, if it happens to you,
I tell you, you become really

57:58.160 --> 58:03.441
the source of such a joy for everyone.

58:03.642 --> 58:09.361
Now, what do we have to do for this world?
What is needed to be done for this world?

58:09.562 --> 58:13.146
People talk of peace, this, that. There’s
no need to do anything.

58:13.347 --> 58:17.921
It just… you become a personality of that
kind -

58:18.122 --> 58:23.918
you emit peace, you emit love, you emit joy
to others.

58:24.119 --> 58:28.037
Now, this power is within you because it is
built-in, it's within you.

58:28.238 --> 58:34.069
It is in a potential form in every person.
Only thing, it has to be brought out.

58:34.270 --> 58:47.137
Now, with affection, you may not, but with
love and feeling that is innate within you.

58:47.338 --> 58:52.097
Because there are no words for such subtle
things that are within yourself.

58:52.298 --> 58:55.401
Because so far people don’t know what are
these things

58:55.602 --> 58:59.553
that make you feel oneness with others.

58:59.754 --> 59:07.547
All this, all this can happen to you very
easily, very easily,

59:07.748 --> 59:14.635
when you understand that you are not this
mind, you are not this body,

59:14.836 --> 59:20.565
you are not this attention - you are
the Spirit.

59:22.743 --> 59:26.464
Then you introspect, "Am I the Spirit?
All right, if I am the Spirit,

59:26.665 --> 59:30.122
what is… what am I doing?"

59:32.150 --> 59:36.532
Once you become the Spirit, then you feel,
"Why not others?"

59:36.733 --> 59:41.039
Out of love and compassion. Not for
becoming some leaders or anything.

59:41.240 --> 59:45.464
Just out of love. "If I am that why not
make others like that?"

59:45.665 --> 59:48.532
And that is how Sahaja Yoga has spread
so much,

59:48.733 --> 59:52.827
and we have such gems of people, such
beautiful people

59:53.028 --> 59:58.722
that I really never expected so much
to happen in My lifetime.

59:58.923 --> 01:00:04.096
It has never happened with any saint, any
incarnation, any prophet.

01:00:04.297 --> 01:00:08.722
So now, you people have become absolutely

01:00:08.923 --> 01:00:13.630
‘Khalis’ means absolutely you have vacated
yourself fully.

01:00:13.831 --> 01:00:17.382
The story of Radha and Krishna is very
beautiful

01:00:17.583 --> 01:00:24.250
where Radha said that, "Why do You take
this...

01:00:29.763 --> 01:00:31.910
[Hindi: "I don’t know the English word
for Murli’"],

01:00:32.111 --> 01:00:35.655
flute... to Your throat? Why do You take
this?"

01:00:35.856 --> 01:00:39.553
Because Murli is such a sweet thing, ‘na’,
flute is not so sweet.

01:00:39.754 --> 01:00:44.023
"But why do You take this flute to Your
lips?"

01:00:44.224 --> 01:00:49.182
After all… She, She must have been jealous,
I think so.

01:00:49.868 --> 01:00:56.185
So, it's a story, just a story. So, He
said, "Why not go and ask the flute?"

01:00:56.386 --> 01:00:59.827
So, flute She went and asked, "Why
Shri Krishna

01:01:00.028 --> 01:01:03.604
takes you to His lips all the time?"

01:01:03.805 --> 01:01:07.606
So, he said, she said, "You know,

01:01:07.807 --> 01:01:12.900
I have become completely hollow. There’s
nothing in me.

01:01:13.101 --> 01:01:20.397
He puts me to His lips and people say
that I am playing the tune.

01:01:20.598 --> 01:01:26.393
It’s He who is playing the tune. Where
am I? I’m not there.

01:01:26.624 --> 01:01:31.705
I’m just enjoying the same tune, which is
passing through me.

01:01:33.073 --> 01:01:38.271
That is the expression." But then Radha
told Shri Krishna,

01:01:38.472 --> 01:01:42.489
"Why don't You make (me) the same way
as the flute?"

01:01:42.690 --> 01:01:48.060
So, this is what you have to be, the flute,
means you have to be hollow within yourself.

01:01:48.261 --> 01:01:55.152
All these little, little things, you know,
which come into your life are not important.

01:01:55.353 --> 01:02:01.103
What is important is - have you become
completely hollow?

01:02:01.324 --> 01:02:05.069
This is where, I would say, introspection
will help.

01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:10.315
The one who makes the flute is also within
you.

01:02:10.516 --> 01:02:17.867
So let there be a flute made out of you
by yourself only.

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:24.512
This is the way you make yourself what you
have to become.

01:02:24.713 --> 01:02:29.483
In Gita Shri Krishna has said, "Atmaneva
Atmane Shrushta",

01:02:29.684 --> 01:02:33.306
means the Spirit gets satisfied by itself.

01:02:33.507 --> 01:02:37.150
Isn't it very difficult thing to
understand -

01:02:37.351 --> 01:02:40.755
how can the Spirit be satisfied by itself?

01:02:40.959 --> 01:02:43.932
But now you can understand what
Shri Krishna has said

01:02:44.133 --> 01:02:50.006
that your own Spirit becomes satisfied with
itself.

01:02:50.207 --> 01:02:53.355
Then it doesn't require any other
satisfaction.

01:02:53.556 --> 01:02:57.659
You seek the comfort of your Spirit, you
seek the joy of your Spirit,

01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:00.987
you seek the beauty of your Spirit.

01:03:01.188 --> 01:03:10.877
You don't even seek, but it is in itself
is filled with that joy of the Spirit

01:03:11.078 --> 01:03:16.360
and it only can be satisfied by itself.

01:03:16.561 --> 01:03:19.526
There are many people who say, "I am not
satisfied, you see,

01:03:19.726 --> 01:03:24.846
this I am not very much satisfied, it is
not that I am satisfied."

01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:31.242
In the same way, the Spirit can say,
"I am not satisfied."

01:03:31.443 --> 01:03:37.366
But the Spirit can be satisfied with Spirit
only.

01:03:37.813 --> 01:03:42.886
It’s like the reflection in the mirror.
When you look at the mirror you see there

01:03:43.183 --> 01:03:48.280
your own reflection. Now, if the mirror is
not all right, I will say,

01:03:48.481 --> 01:03:52.206
"I am not satisfied with what reflection
we are getting out of this mirror."

01:03:52.407 --> 01:03:55.005
So you’ll change the mirror, you’ll bring
the better mirror,

01:03:55.206 --> 01:04:00.040
you'll try to get a better picture
of yourself. In the same way,

01:04:00.241 --> 01:04:06.921
the Spirit which is reflected within you,
wants to see its own image.

01:04:07.122 --> 01:04:12.594
And then what you do is to… you go on,
somehow or other,

01:04:12.795 --> 01:04:20.191
changing, cleaning, making it all right
through your meditation

01:04:20.422 --> 01:04:25.059
so that your Spirit is satisfied with
the Spirit.

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:29.308
Shri Krishna wrote Gita in such a ambiguous
manner because He was very clever.

01:04:29.459 --> 01:04:31.605
He knew human beings cannot take things
straight,

01:04:31.806 --> 01:04:33.786
so tell them this way, that way, that way,

01:04:33.987 --> 01:04:38.362
so that they’ll run around and then
ultimately they will come to Truth.

01:04:38.563 --> 01:04:43.460
But Truth is very simple. Truth is
extremely simple.

01:04:43.661 --> 01:04:47.222
You don't have to go here and there and
you don't have to stand on your legs

01:04:47.423 --> 01:04:52.737
or feet all the time. You don't have
to fight with anything.

01:04:52.938 --> 01:04:59.671
You don't have to take to some sort of
a ‘tapasya’, abstinence - nothing.

01:04:59.872 --> 01:05:08.593
Only just you become like a flute. You
become hollow.

01:05:08.794 --> 01:05:12.874
It’s not difficult. It’s not difficult
at all for Sahaja Yogis

01:05:13.075 --> 01:05:17.441
because already the Kundalini has made
you hollow. It’s not difficult.

01:05:17.642 --> 01:05:24.357
But still, I find people deviate. Their
attention goes here and there.

01:05:24.558 --> 01:05:27.547
So many people have told Me how their
problems were solved

01:05:27.748 --> 01:05:31.603
without doing anything about it. I said,
"What did you do?"

01:05:31.804 --> 01:05:36.818
"No, Mother, we just put it at Your lotus
feet." I said, "Really?"

01:05:37.019 --> 01:05:41.449
"Yes, that's all. Or we were just looking
at the problem, what the problem is.

01:05:41.650 --> 01:05:46.595
We were standing outside and looking
at the problem and the problem got solved."

01:05:46.796 --> 01:05:50.401
Even the most difficult problems that you
think, can be solved

01:05:50.602 --> 01:05:58.218
very easily because you have powers. Your
powers are great.

01:05:58.419 --> 01:06:03.350
You are saints, but more than saints,

01:06:03.777 --> 01:06:09.913
much more than saints because you are born
at such a volatile times.

01:06:10.114 --> 01:06:15.879
Like supposing, you have a light in
darkness, you are finding something,

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:19.843
you bump into that and you bump into that.

01:06:20.044 --> 01:06:25.891
But supposing, this is a place full of gas,

01:06:26.272 --> 01:06:33.727
you bring one light, the whole thing becomes
enlightened. Like that you have powers.

01:06:33.928 --> 01:06:42.499
But you must get out of this nonsense
of "me", "my" and "mine".

01:06:43.623 --> 01:06:47.679
I don't know how to say you get out -
It’s not like a swimming pool,

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:51.413
that you jump into it and get out. It’s not
like that.

01:06:51.614 --> 01:07:00.046
It is another kind of a very subtle
understanding that our roots have to grow.

01:07:00.247 --> 01:07:03.804
And for growing our roots, we have to go
within ourselves

01:07:04.005 --> 01:07:12.249
and find out within ourselves what is
the area we are occupying,

01:07:12.450 --> 01:07:20.087
in what areas in our lifestyle we are
taking these roots inside.

01:07:20.288 --> 01:07:26.690
Also, Shri Krishna has said that the tree
of life has the roots in the brain

01:07:26.891 --> 01:07:30.426
and grows downward. It’s very interesting
to understand

01:07:30.627 --> 01:07:34.109
that the roots are growing in the brain.

01:07:34.310 --> 01:07:42.437
That means, your own intellect is just
covered with compassion,

01:07:42.638 --> 01:07:53.895
it’s just being absolutely one with
compassion.

01:07:54.506 --> 01:07:57.033
I had told you a story about a saint

01:07:57.234 --> 01:08:01.721
who was to take to… water for the Deity
n Gujarat

01:08:01.922 --> 01:08:08.978
and he walked one month to go there with
a pitcher of water.

01:08:09.179 --> 01:08:17.066
And then at the… because it was a very
high mountain on which this Deity was,

01:08:17.267 --> 01:08:22.786
and he reached at the foothill.

01:08:22.987 --> 01:08:28.125
There he found a little donkey dying
of thirst

01:08:28.326 --> 01:08:32.805
so he poured all the water for that donkey.

01:08:33.006 --> 01:08:35.575
So those who were with him, they asked,
"What are you doing?

01:08:35.776 --> 01:08:39.492
You brought it all the way, and why are
you putting it for this donkey?"

01:08:39.693 --> 01:08:40.661
He said, "You don't know?

01:08:40.862 --> 01:08:44.771
The God has come all the way down, just
to meet me here.

01:08:44.972 --> 01:08:47.067
He doesn't want me to climb up."

01:08:47.268 --> 01:08:55.504
This kind of an absolutely simple
understanding

01:08:55.705 --> 01:09:03.471
of another's feelings and another's
problems:

01:09:03.672 --> 01:09:07.938
you can solve them, you can sort them out.

01:09:08.139 --> 01:09:11.060
And the person will tell you that, "You
sorted out my problem."

01:09:11.261 --> 01:09:17.129
But you will not know how you have solved
because this love is the power.

01:09:17.330 --> 01:09:21.011
This love can see things. It is everything.

01:09:21.212 --> 01:09:25.057
It’s like a… you see a television,
all right, it’s a television.

01:09:25.258 --> 01:09:27.681
If you see a telephone, it's a telephone.

01:09:27.882 --> 01:09:36.369
If you see anything you do with the power,
it’s all is embodied inside this love.

01:09:36.570 --> 01:09:41.159
You need not have to telephone. I never
telephone to anyone.

01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:44.830
Mostly I never telephone. I mean, if
somebody forces Me then it’s all right.

01:09:45.031 --> 01:09:48.177
I never telephone. But not to save
the bill,

01:09:48.378 --> 01:09:52.738
but I do not telephone because there is
no need.

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:57.051
The whole subtle of the ether is at your
feet.

01:09:57.252 --> 01:10:03.702
Just you want to do something you can just
do it, just with the vibrations.

01:10:03.903 --> 01:10:08.920
Now, many people say, "Mother, cure this
person, cure that person." There’s no need.

01:10:09.121 --> 01:10:14.832
You all can cure, you are so many. You can
cure anyone you want to,

01:10:15.033 --> 01:10:18.348
but you bring that person to Me. It’s not
needed.

01:10:18.549 --> 01:10:21.268
Just you can cure anybody you feel like.

01:10:21.469 --> 01:10:27.677
You can solve all their problems yourself.
One little Bandhan can solve it.

01:10:27.878 --> 01:10:31.445
But for that you should be the source
of love.

01:10:31.646 --> 01:10:40.274
Once you give a Bandhan, the… this powerful
love takes over,

01:10:40.475 --> 01:10:43.918
"All right, I'll do the job."

01:10:45.151 --> 01:10:49.712
But for that you have to be the master
of this beautiful thing.

01:10:49.913 --> 01:10:54.770
Now, one thing is very different from other
masteries.

01:10:54.971 --> 01:10:58.526
In other masteries, you see people try
to dominate

01:10:58.727 --> 01:11:03.946
or to, try to use it for destroying others.

01:11:04.147 --> 01:11:12.961
But the mastery of love is that you know
how to build

01:11:13.931 --> 01:11:22.492
a rapport with the Divine love. And this
Divine love is not only powerful,

01:11:22.693 --> 01:11:33.956
but it is such a efficient, I should say,
such an alert instrument

01:11:34.157 --> 01:11:37.253
which works out everything in such a manner

01:11:37.454 --> 01:11:42.217
that you are amazed how things have worked
out.

01:11:42.418 --> 01:11:46.072
And everybody has noticed it. I know you
all know it.

01:11:46.273 --> 01:11:48.770
Not that you don't know, but you don't use.

01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:53.530
You have to be on the vibratory awareness
and use that.

01:11:53.731 --> 01:11:57.645
Even giving yourself is a Bandhan itself
clarifies you.

01:11:57.846 --> 01:12:04.981
Imagine in your hand there is this great
power of giving you this balance,

01:12:05.182 --> 01:12:09.387
this love, this affection and all
the protection

01:12:09.588 --> 01:12:14.077
while you can give it to others also. You
have become now

01:12:14.278 --> 01:12:19.417
the part and parcel of the Divine power.
You are now in the Kingdom of God.

01:12:19.618 --> 01:12:24.295
And whatever you want to do can be done
by this divine power.

01:12:24.496 --> 01:12:29.530
With all this telling you I still feel,
sometimes, you are not confident.

01:12:29.731 --> 01:12:35.987
You get upset. You feel that, "How can
this be?"

01:12:36.188 --> 01:12:39.848
You have no trust in yourself, you have no
faith in yourself.

01:12:40.049 --> 01:12:47.215
And also there are some people, sort of,
who feel they are neglected,

01:12:47.416 --> 01:12:51.278
or something should have happened to them.

01:12:51.479 --> 01:12:56.641
Once a lady started crying. So, I said,
"Why is she crying?"

01:12:56.842 --> 01:13:01.846
She said, "Because Mother didn't smile
at me." I didn’t smile at her?

01:13:02.047 --> 01:13:07.471
But I never smiled at anyone. I don't know
why she thinks like that.

01:13:07.672 --> 01:13:13.960
So, I asked her, "Why do you want Me
to smile at you? What's wrong with you?

01:13:14.161 --> 01:13:17.248
You are all right? Why should I smile
at you?"

01:13:17.449 --> 01:13:20.250
So, you see, also this kind of a feeling

01:13:20.451 --> 01:13:23.598
that comes up sometimes that in Sahaja
Yoga,

01:13:23.799 --> 01:13:28.775
Mother should all the time be only attached
to you.

01:13:28.976 --> 01:13:33.532
She cannot get attached, you know.
It’s a helpless condition I have.

01:13:33.733 --> 01:13:38.345
There are so many, you don't know, defects
I have, which you have no idea.

01:13:38.546 --> 01:13:40.421
I don't know how to count money.

01:13:40.622 --> 01:13:43.791
If I… give Me hundred rupees I’ll count it
two hundred rupees.

01:13:43.992 --> 01:13:46.337
You see, I don't know many things. I don't
know banking;

01:13:46.538 --> 01:13:50.159
I don't know many things and one of them
is I don't know

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:56.307
how to put attention to this person or
to that person. Like politicians would do -

01:13:56.508 --> 01:14:01.152
"You see, ah, you must look after this man,
because he is very important." Nothing.

01:14:01.353 --> 01:14:06.933
To Me you are just part and parcel of Me,
finished, nothing more than that.

01:14:07.134 --> 01:14:12.975
So, you see, everybody so should know that
you are very close to My heart,

01:14:13.176 --> 01:14:17.837
you are very much there, I am very proud
of you. And something,

01:14:18.038 --> 01:14:23.811
really it’s a miracle that has happened,
that you people have taken to Sahaja Yoga.

01:14:24.012 --> 01:14:28.910
So on that point also, that how much Mother
cares for me, what She does...

01:14:29.111 --> 01:14:31.708
Now supposing, I tell somebody, "All right,
you don't sit here, sit there,"

01:14:31.909 --> 01:14:35.390
they feel bad. Anything you do, they feel
bad.

01:14:35.591 --> 01:14:41.278
This kind of a person has no sense of love.
He doesn't understand Mother's love.

01:14:41.479 --> 01:14:44.258
So, at the end of the whole thing I must
tell you,

01:14:44.459 --> 01:14:49.042
that when you are a guru, you are also
a mother.

01:14:49.243 --> 01:14:55.213
You have to express yourself like a mother.
She is kind, she is gentle, she forgives.

01:14:55.414 --> 01:14:59.856
She also corrects whenever it’s necessary,
but in her own sweet way she corrects

01:15:00.057 --> 01:15:04.605
so the correction takes place - it's not
that a rebellion starts.

01:15:04.806 --> 01:15:11.386
So all that wisdom of a mother is within
you, is already there, so please try to use.

01:15:11.571 --> 01:15:17.615
I am sure, it will all work out and as it
is we are a very beautiful group of people

01:15:17.816 --> 01:15:28.946
who are something out of the blue, who are
so much in peace and in joy together.

01:15:29.147 --> 01:15:32.414
May God bless you all.

01:15:41.933 --> 01:15:44.906
So, today's Guru Puja will be...

01:15:45.107 --> 01:15:50.112
Of course, we can - we can have a little
of Ganesha's Atharva Sheersha,

01:15:50.313 --> 01:15:53.551
but Devi Puja will be much less.

01:15:53.752 --> 01:15:59.754
And for Guru Puja I would request
the country leaders to come up.

01:15:59.955 --> 01:16:04.665
Country leaders have to come up. So it is
in a different way,

01:16:04.866 --> 01:16:08.761
we can say that the main thing is
the Guru Puja

01:16:08.962 --> 01:16:11.421
where the country leaders have to come up.

01:16:11.622 --> 01:16:17.691
The Devi Puja will be followed after that,
which is very short.

01:16:18.846 --> 01:16:22.649
(Hindi: "Please, change this tea.")
