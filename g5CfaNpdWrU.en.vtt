03:23.609 --> 03:34.321
In Sahaja Yoga the Guru puja has a very
different significance

03:34.522 --> 03:39.297
from any other guru puja.

03:43.300 --> 03:47.868
When you worship your Guru

03:48.069 --> 03:56.078
you are also worshipping the Guru within
you.

04:00.247 --> 04:10.595
This is not in any other guru-disciple
system

04:10.796 --> 04:22.097
because, in you, the Guru, the Master has
been awakened.

04:22.298 --> 04:27.786
And so, when you are worshipping your Guru,

04:27.986 --> 04:34.332
then this Master within you is also
worshipped, you respect it,

04:34.533 --> 04:41.207
you glorify it, you awaken it, and you
manifest it.

04:41.866 --> 04:51.337
This we have to realise that – in Sahaja
Yoga – if you are a Sahaja Yogi.

04:52.052 --> 05:02.858
Now, the quality of Guru, first and
foremost, is that he makes you meet God:

05:03.493 --> 05:07.511
means he raises the Kundalini

05:07.712 --> 05:16.467
and establish the relation between
the All-pervading Power.

05:17.165 --> 05:19.701
And as your Guru is Adi Shakti,

05:19.902 --> 05:24.553
you make that person meet, also,
the Adi Shakti.

05:24.754 --> 05:30.116
So you have a double advantage that,
at the same time,

05:30.317 --> 05:33.468
when you give them Realisation,

05:33.669 --> 05:40.611
not only that you make them feel the union
with the Divine Power,

05:40.812 --> 05:44.914
but you can make them meet the Divinity
Itself,

05:45.114 --> 05:48.584
the source of Divine Power.

05:48.785 --> 05:54.023
So your responsibility, as Sahaja Yogis,
is very great

05:54.224 --> 05:58.047
because in you is there is the Guru.

05:58.248 --> 06:06.097
Now in our mantras we say that, “Mother,
I am my own Guru.”

06:06.298 --> 06:13.722
But, saying that, do we realise that:
if I am my own Guru,

06:13.923 --> 06:21.645
this “I” and “my Guru,” between the two,
what have I achieved?

06:21.846 --> 06:26.907
Where am I? Can I guide myself?

06:27.153 --> 06:31.405
Have I got the light of the Spirit on my
attention so well established

06:31.606 --> 06:39.490
and manifested that I can guide myself and
guide others later on?

06:39.691 --> 06:44.886
First of all, in the Guru principle it is
important

06:45.087 --> 06:49.991
that you see to yourself –
the introspection:

06:50.192 --> 06:57.240
Can I be my own Guru? Have I become
my own Guru?

06:59.409 --> 07:06.885
Now, in your case, your Guru is a Mother,
a woman,

07:07.086 --> 07:18.815
so, it has to be among women that
the development of their Guru qualities

07:19.016 --> 07:26.332
have to be very well manifested. But it’s
just the way it is not.

07:26.533 --> 07:29.938
For them, they are still the mothers or
they are the wives

07:30.139 --> 07:39.776
or they are Sahaja Yoginis. But they don’t
realise that you are also the Gurus.

07:39.977 --> 07:43.743
And, because your Mother is a Guru,
because She is a woman;

07:43.944 --> 07:48.992
and you have to be also of that quality,
that people should say,

07:49.193 --> 07:51.853
“Look at this woman, she’s such a Guru.”

07:52.054 --> 07:55.951
But still, as I hear from the different
leaders

07:56.151 --> 08:00.417
that the ladies are absolutely still very
much far away

08:00.618 --> 08:06.415
and are very few who can be called as real
Sahaja Yoginis.

08:06.616 --> 08:10.038
It’s a sad thing to hear.

08:10.239 --> 08:18.233
Because if you still keep to all these
mundane things of womanhood

08:18.434 --> 08:23.604
and the drawbacks of womanhood, which has
come out of domination maybe,

08:23.805 --> 08:28.458
because of always they were shown to be
something lower.

08:28.659 --> 08:35.647
Specially in the Christian religion they
were never regarded as something holy.

08:35.848 --> 08:39.494
They have this kind of a diffidence in them

08:39.695 --> 08:42.965
that they don’t understand that dharma

08:43.166 --> 08:47.272
can be established more by women than
by men.

08:47.473 --> 08:51.500
And the Guru’s work is to establish
the dharma –

08:51.701 --> 08:57.635
in the society, in the family, in
relationships.

08:57.836 --> 09:03.355
All these Gurus, which are representing
all these great symbols here,

09:03.556 --> 09:06.998
have done nothing but have established
dharma.

09:07.199 --> 09:10.710
But, first of all, before establishing
the dharma,

09:10.911 --> 09:16.845
we should watch ourselves – have we got
dharma within ourselves or not?

09:18.702 --> 09:24.551
First of all, the quality of a person who
has dharma

09:24.752 --> 09:32.814
is that he listens to others, he obeys.

09:34.719 --> 09:38.031
And this is something [that] has gone wrong
with the Western women, I think,

09:38.232 --> 09:43.704
that they have forgotten how to listen to
others, how to obey others.

09:43.905 --> 09:47.941
That’s why their children also don’t obey
them.

09:50.314 --> 09:55.287
Obedience, if you do not have, nobody’s
going to obey you.

09:55.488 --> 09:58.807
First, you must learn to obey.

09:59.008 --> 10:07.805
A person like Kabira, because he was born
of a unknown cast,

10:08.029 --> 10:12.306
people didn’t know what he was born from,

10:12.507 --> 10:19.494
and he could not go directly to any Guru.

10:19.695 --> 10:26.794
So, he heard about Ramanand, a great Guru
of those days,

10:26.995 --> 10:31.795
who used to go to the river Ganges every
morning to have his bath.

10:31.996 --> 10:37.660
So one day on his steps Kabira kept lying,

10:37.869 --> 10:43.974
and in the darkness the Guru could not see,
and he touched him with his feet.

10:44.175 --> 10:48.404
He said, “Who are you?” So he said,
“I’m Kabir,

10:48.605 --> 10:54.041
and I’m your disciple.” And he caught hold
of his feet.

10:54.242 --> 10:57.776
And when he caught hold of his feet, he
[Ramanand] said, “Alright, come along!”.

10:57.977 --> 11:04.959
And then he became such a great saint
in India.

11:05.173 --> 11:09.175
People know him more than they know his
Guru; he became so great.

11:09.376 --> 11:11.726
The basic thing is humility.

11:11.927 --> 11:15.396
Yesterday you saw how the musician
(Nishat Khan) was humble.

11:15.597 --> 11:18.764
All the time he was humble.

11:18.965 --> 11:22.293
He didn’t know how to express his humility
every time.

11:22.494 --> 11:25.391
All the time he was humble.

11:25.592 --> 11:31.095
Because in humility only you can receive
the blessings,

11:31.296 --> 11:37.999
you can receive the quality that is of your
Guru.

11:39.933 --> 11:42.309
Now, for a Guru as you have seen

11:42.510 --> 11:49.032
that, in My own way, in My own image,
you have to come up.

11:49.233 --> 11:52.917
First of all your life should be absolutely
transparent.

11:53.118 --> 11:56.213
Transparency is the essence of Sahaja Yoga.

11:56.414 --> 11:59.428
Everybody should know what you are doing,
where you are going,

11:59.629 --> 12:06.637
what is the way you live, what is the way
you are behaving.

12:06.838 --> 12:12.658
I have seen people, who are gurus, also
in the sense that we call them leaders,

12:12.859 --> 12:15.773
or we can call them sub-gurus, or they
cannot be called as priest,

12:15.973 --> 12:19.621
but I can say ‘communication centres’
as they are.

12:19.822 --> 12:27.445
In them you find that they are very fussy
type of people.

12:27.646 --> 12:31.427
Always think about their body, always think
about their comfort,

12:31.628 --> 12:35.200
always grudge about – nobody looked after
them –

12:35.401 --> 12:39.770
as if they suffer from persecution-mania!

12:40.237 --> 12:43.924
Or they will grudge about food, “I didn’t
eat my food for one day!”

12:44.125 --> 12:45.822
Doesn’t matter!

12:46.023 --> 12:50.687
For a Guru it’s better to starve for about
three, four days nicely,

12:50.888 --> 12:55.656
so that you get over this idea of hunger.

12:55.857 --> 12:59.617
You’ll be surprised since I’m here I have
not eaten anything much,

12:59.818 --> 13:04.571
and just drinking something, because just
the Guru has no hunger.

13:04.772 --> 13:09.426
Because it is in your stomach the Guru,
vibrations, are so much

13:09.627 --> 13:12.442
that you don’t feel like eating anything.

13:12.643 --> 13:16.092
So then, what do you eat and how do you
eat and all these things

13:16.293 --> 13:18.703
that we have given up to come to Sahaja
Yoga.

13:18.904 --> 13:21.990
So even if leaders have this nonsense
in their head

13:22.190 --> 13:27.770
[like] what do you get to eat! I mean, this
is the basics, absolutely!

13:27.971 --> 13:31.250
And when I hear some people telling Me, oh,
what did they eat

13:31.450 --> 13:38.607
and how did they eat and all! It’s like I
feel they are like tourists in Sahaja Yoga.

13:38.808 --> 13:41.627
Just come in Sahaja Yoga like tourists,

13:41.828 --> 13:44.083
you see, to see places and go round

13:44.284 --> 13:50.701
and to know where you get, in what
restaurant, you get good food and cheaply.

13:52.288 --> 13:55.862
All this is so basically,

13:56.063 --> 14:02.339
absolutely not a manifestation of Guru
principle.

14:02.540 --> 14:06.891
Now you have seen your Guru as She is.

14:07.092 --> 14:13.096
I do not know what I eat, what they give
Me, what I want.

14:13.297 --> 14:16.599
They go on giving Me whatever they think
I like,

14:16.800 --> 14:20.970
and I just don’t know if I like that thing
or not, or what is it.

14:21.171 --> 14:23.517
If they ask Me, “Mother, what will You
have?” I said, “What will I have,

14:23.718 --> 14:26.833
I don’t know really, what will I have?
Anything!”

14:27.034 --> 14:29.177
So there has to be no choices.

14:29.378 --> 14:33.316
First of all not to waste your attention
on choices.

14:33.517 --> 14:36.353
Of course, only on vibrations.

14:36.554 --> 14:38.959
I mean, supposing, you go to a restaurant,

14:39.160 --> 14:42.643
find all kinds of funny vibrations there,

14:42.844 --> 14:45.949
people are getting drunk or anything, then
of course you should say.

14:46.150 --> 14:51.155
But all the choices must be based on
vibrations and not on material things.

14:51.356 --> 14:53.389
That you get something nice there,
“Let’s go there,”

14:53.590 --> 14:59.620
and they’ll travel for fifty miles to go
eat something nonsensical.

14:59.821 --> 15:03.253
It should be all nonsense for all Sahaja
Yogis.

15:03.454 --> 15:07.051
And when I said “Sahaja Yogi” it means
also Sahaja Yoginis.

15:07.252 --> 15:11.022
So the food part of it is aswadha.

15:11.223 --> 15:14.899
You should not have any taste for any
special food.

15:15.100 --> 15:17.793
Specially in France to say that people
may not like,

15:17.994 --> 15:26.643
but French are very, very conscientious or
aware about the food part.

15:26.844 --> 15:29.876
I don’t know how far they make really
good food,

15:30.077 --> 15:33.960
but at least they think they eat very good
food. Alright.

15:34.161 --> 15:41.349
So, the eating of good food is a kind
of an addiction.

15:41.550 --> 15:44.376
It’s a kind of an addiction; it’s something
like drug –

15:44.577 --> 15:46.814
that you must have good food.

15:47.015 --> 15:52.956
So Zen started this system of what they
call the tea ceremony.

15:53.157 --> 15:58.449
In the tea ceremony what they did, I mean,
I have been through that

15:58.650 --> 16:03.012
and it’s really quite a test of people.

16:03.213 --> 16:07.740
With Me it was alright, but the rest
of them got really frightened.

16:07.941 --> 16:10.786
That in the tea ceremony whatever rituals
they do

16:10.987 --> 16:14.986
they give you a tea, which is so bitter,

16:15.187 --> 16:17.664
and we can say [like] quinine raised
to power 108!

16:17.865 --> 16:20.414
It’s like that. And they give you very
nicely,

16:20.615 --> 16:25.761
handle you with such ritual that you have
to take it.

16:25.962 --> 16:31.013
So first they say, “You see the cup without
thinking.”

16:31.214 --> 16:34.723
So he tried to make thoughtless awareness
through the cup.

16:34.924 --> 16:37.766
I don’t know how much one can achieve
with that.

16:37.967 --> 16:46.754
But that tea if you take once, your tongue
is good for anything.

16:48.929 --> 16:53.706
And to compensate it they give you
something sweet,

16:53.907 --> 16:56.598
which is again sweetness raised to power
108,

16:56.799 --> 17:01.536
so sweet that it becomes bitter! So sweet.

17:01.739 --> 17:05.838
So this is just to conquer the tongue
[that] Zen must have thought

17:06.039 --> 17:11.522
that better give them this tea ceremony

17:11.723 --> 17:14.586
where there is no tea, there’s nothing

17:14.787 --> 17:19.718
but just you really give such shocks
to your tongue,

17:19.919 --> 17:23.912
so that after that you can eat whatever
you get.

17:24.113 --> 17:30.443
And that’s why you must know that Japanese
can eat anything.

17:30.644 --> 17:34.804
They have solved their food problem
because they can eat anything!

17:35.005 --> 17:43.969
They can just fish out some crabs or could
be some prawns,

17:44.170 --> 17:47.945
just peel them out like peanuts and eat
them like that.

17:48.146 --> 17:50.138
I think Zen has solved this problem
for them,

17:50.338 --> 17:54.390
because they have food shortage and this is
how they can eat everything:

17:54.591 --> 17:57.253
they can eat the bark of the tree, they can
eat the snake,

17:57.454 --> 18:01.284
they can eat the lizards, they can eat
the frogs, everything they can eat.

18:01.485 --> 18:07.215
So all their eating problems are solved
in that country by Zen, I think,

18:07.416 --> 18:12.686
because you have no taste.

18:13.345 --> 18:18.319
But in this I think the worst are,
in the whole world are Indians.

18:18.536 --> 18:23.641
They are the fussiest people for food.
Because their women have spoiled them.

18:23.842 --> 18:25.675
They know very good cooking and they know

18:25.876 --> 18:28.527
how to handle their husbands by cooking
very well.

18:28.728 --> 18:31.049
And the way they cook food for them,
you see,

18:31.249 --> 18:33.541
the men have to go back to Indian food.

18:33.742 --> 18:36.999
Even if they travel the whole world,
they’ll need Indian food,

18:37.200 --> 18:39.173
they can’t get over their tongues.

18:39.374 --> 18:42.912
It is such a big conditioning in India
of food

18:43.113 --> 18:45.356
that I just don’t know how will they get
out,

18:45.557 --> 18:49.892
the, absolutely, the basics which are
important.

18:50.093 --> 18:53.047
Gandhiji tried that very much in
the ashram.

18:53.248 --> 19:00.620
He used to give horrid food, boiled food
with the oil of mustard on top

19:00.821 --> 19:03.805
and then nobody could eat that. Raw!

19:04.006 --> 19:06.426
And he used to make everybody eat that.

19:06.627 --> 19:12.424
Not only that, he would make them clean
the bathrooms, WC’s, everything

19:12.625 --> 19:16.191
so that you get rid of your nose also, that
you need everything.

19:16.392 --> 19:18.991
Because so many people you will, while
eating also in India

19:19.192 --> 19:22.229
will put something to their noses, and they
smell everything.

19:22.430 --> 19:26.058
So they are oversensitive to their tongue
and to their nose.

19:26.259 --> 19:28.839
But not to their eyes, to eyes they are
not.

19:29.040 --> 19:34.927
For eyes I would say the most sensitive
people are Japanese and Chinese

19:35.128 --> 19:37.775
and also the Western people are very much
sensitive

19:37.975 --> 19:41.487
because they don’t like to see anything
dirty, filthy or ugly.

19:41.688 --> 19:43.952
Indians won’t mind any dirt, filth,
anything,

19:44.153 --> 19:51.461
just like dogs and what you call, horses
or buffalos!

19:51.662 --> 19:54.907
They can walk through any dirt, filth –
anything!

19:55.108 --> 19:58.638
Nothing matters to them, anything ugly,
any ugly building

19:58.839 --> 20:02.274
or an ugly dress or anything is alright
for them.

20:02.475 --> 20:05.485
It doesn’t matter, to their eyes it doesn’t
matter at all.

20:05.686 --> 20:09.664
Only thing [is that] kitchen should be clean
and they are all the time in the kitchen.

20:09.865 --> 20:12.452
So we don’t have to learn all these bad
things from Indians.

20:12.653 --> 20:15.577
There are some good things they have, but
there are certain things

20:15.778 --> 20:17.297
[which] are very bad conditionings.

20:17.498 --> 20:20.549
And the next to that are, I think,
the French.

20:20.750 --> 20:23.614
But if you eat English food you can become
quite good

20:23.814 --> 20:27.963
because there’s no taste in English food.

20:39.198 --> 20:44.691
So, I have no problem anywhere because
I think I have no taste at all

20:44.892 --> 20:47.663
and I can eat anything any way it is
cooked, it’s alright,

20:47.864 --> 20:51.939
I don’t bother about what is cooked, what
is not cooked.

20:52.140 --> 20:56.447
But if you have some French people for
a dinner in a restaurant

20:56.648 --> 20:59.390
they will spend forty-five minutes deciding
what they are going to eat,

20:59.590 --> 21:01.365
and what a waste of energy!

21:01.566 --> 21:04.325
Forty-five minutes just to decide what they
are going to eat!

21:04.526 --> 21:07.654
After all what is so great, what you are
going to eat? It’s all there.

21:07.855 --> 21:10.172
Just one thing that everybody should have.

21:10.373 --> 21:14.575
So for Sahaja Yogis it’s important to give
up this idea, “I will have this.”

21:14.776 --> 21:20.453
First of all nobody should ask, “What will
you have?”

21:20.654 --> 21:26.132
To Me also. I do not like people asking Me
questions [like], “What will You have?”

21:26.333 --> 21:31.254
Because I’ve to think about it and I want
to be in Nirvichara.

21:47.644 --> 21:54.978
So, this is a, one, big ordeal, which we do
not understand:

21:55.179 --> 22:00.257
how much we are attached to food. And food
goes in the stomach.

22:00.458 --> 22:03.132
And not only that it spoils our guru
system,

22:03.332 --> 22:06.097
but also spoils our physical system.

22:06.298 --> 22:09.728
So we should try not to look at food.

22:09.929 --> 22:13.423
That’s why fasting was told to the all
the people

22:13.624 --> 22:19.562
who wanted to develop their Gurupada,
so that they should not fast.

22:19.763 --> 22:27.213
But they do not fast normally because
they think of food, so there’s no fasting.

22:27.414 --> 22:31.730
I mean, fasting means that you go into
Nirvichara and don’t think of food.

22:31.931 --> 22:35.640
But they are all the time thinking of food,
so it has no meaning

22:35.841 --> 22:40.230
and you are just the same whether you eat it
or not, your mind is eating it all the time.

22:40.431 --> 22:42.938
Then you start thinking, “When will I end
my fast

22:43.139 --> 22:47.372
and know where will I go to have what?”

22:49.129 --> 22:52.047
So this is a very basic thing that we
should get rid

22:52.248 --> 22:55.053
of our habits, of our conditionings –

22:55.254 --> 22:58.398
what we are going to have and what food
we are going to have.

22:58.599 --> 23:05.115
Our children also should be given a proper
training about it that –

23:05.316 --> 23:09.385
it’s alright, sometimes there is no salt,
sometimes there’s no sugar, doesn’t matter.

23:09.586 --> 23:11.659
And sometimes there’s nothing, doesn’t
matter.

23:11.860 --> 23:13.390
Nothing [is] important for a Sahaja Yogi,

23:13.590 --> 23:19.064
you can live without food for days
together, no problem.

23:21.238 --> 23:27.841
So for a Sahaja Yogi there’s nothing like
taste of food and hunger.

23:28.042 --> 23:34.603
There’s only one hunger is to be purified,
to be clean.

23:34.804 --> 23:39.474
This is one of the things that dirties
our mind, we should say,

23:39.675 --> 23:44.170
that we think about food all the time.

23:46.441 --> 23:50.159
Even in Russia I found people carried
all Indian things there,

23:50.360 --> 23:54.346
they were cooking all Indian things, and
I am, poor thing, I can’t eat anything.

23:54.547 --> 23:57.068
So they cooked, brought everything for Me,
thinking I’m an Indian,

23:57.269 --> 24:02.760
but they don’t know I am Zen – I cannot,
I do not, have sense of taste.

24:02.961 --> 24:07.051
So once, to get over taste one has to work
out.

24:07.252 --> 24:10.007
It’s an experiment we have to do with
ourselves.

24:10.208 --> 24:16.225
Unless and until we introspect ourselves
and do experiments we cannot rise.

24:16.426 --> 24:18.944
Because though the Kundalini is trying
her level best,

24:19.144 --> 24:21.001
but your conditionings are so great

24:21.202 --> 24:27.214
that it cannot pierce through and cannot
make you onto that Guru level.

24:27.415 --> 24:31.172
If you see the lives of all these Gurus:
they were married,

24:31.373 --> 24:34.443
they had children, they lived a normal life

24:34.644 --> 24:41.086
but in their own personal life they were
absolutely detached people.

24:41.287 --> 24:46.663
So, first detachment should come from food.

24:46.864 --> 24:51.373
And there whatever you like you just
don’t eat.

24:51.574 --> 24:53.946
That’s the best way. Because already
because of liking something…

24:54.146 --> 24:56.405
supposing if somebody’s fond of ice-cream.

24:56.606 --> 25:00.979
He must have already spoiled his liver;
so then, give [it] up now.

25:01.180 --> 25:04.484
If you like pasta, give up pasta.

25:04.685 --> 25:06.638
If you like something else, just give up,

25:06.839 --> 25:09.736
don’t ask for it and don’t eat it at all;

25:09.937 --> 25:14.829
so that, you see, your mind will get little
bit detached from it.

25:15.030 --> 25:20.247
It’s very easy to achieve this detachment,
I think,

25:20.448 --> 25:26.745
if you work it out in a sensible way. Just
try to punish your body.

25:26.946 --> 25:29.354
You see, if you are your Guru, you better
take hold

25:29.555 --> 25:32.085
of first of all your body and your
conditionings.

25:32.286 --> 25:35.144
You have to treat your body with this
thing.

25:35.345 --> 25:38.004
I am told many girls who have married
abroad

25:38.205 --> 25:40.229
are still making their Indian food and
eating that.

25:40.430 --> 25:42.951
It’s horrible it is! They should starve.

25:43.152 --> 25:46.905
If they starve for say about five, six days
or maybe eight days,

25:47.106 --> 25:50.532
then they’ll eat any food in any case.

25:50.733 --> 25:52.385
That’s why the fasting is given.

25:52.586 --> 25:57.580
So one should adjust oneself to any kind
of food you can have.

25:57.781 --> 26:01.037
And if you want to survive then you eat
anything,

26:01.238 --> 26:03.603
so just make it a point that you get rid

26:03.804 --> 26:07.686
of this very simple conditioning you have –

26:07.887 --> 26:13.023
of liking the food that you want to eat and
you don’t want to have anything else.

26:13.224 --> 26:18.053
I think as Sahaja Yogini or Sahaja Yogi who
cannot get rid of this little thing,

26:18.254 --> 26:21.916
then how can you call him a Sahaja Yogi?
I don’t know. He’s very asahaj.

26:22.117 --> 26:24.926
Because the other day I met one lady.

26:25.127 --> 26:26.754
I said, “What is the matter, where have
you been?”

26:26.955 --> 26:30.717
She said, “I have been looking out for some
sort of an Indian ingredient.”

26:30.918 --> 26:34.771
I said, “How can you get it here in this
Spain? You cannot.” “Why?”

26:34.972 --> 26:37.622
“Because they asked me to make Indian
food.” “Alright.

26:37.823 --> 26:39.457
Then without that can’t you make Indian
food?

26:39.658 --> 26:41.818
What is the need to run all the way, whole
day

26:42.019 --> 26:44.009
for a one small little thing called hing
(asafoetida)?”.

26:44.210 --> 26:46.799
There’s a big name for that, it’s a small
little thing.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.010
Just to get that she had to run all over
the places to get it!

26:51.211 --> 26:55.729
So for people who are Sahaja Yogis if they
are sahaj,

26:55.930 --> 27:03.085
whatever is available you can make
something nice out of it and eat it.

27:03.286 --> 27:06.820
So that shows what? It shows sagacity,

27:07.021 --> 27:11.516
shows trupti (contentment), shows your
satisfaction.

27:11.717 --> 27:14.844
And that is one of the manifestations
of a Guru

27:15.045 --> 27:17.894
that he’s a satisfied soul.

27:18.095 --> 27:21.852
He’s just self-contained, he doesn’t
bother.

27:22.053 --> 27:25.963
Now, for example, some people, specially
in the West,

27:26.163 --> 27:28.620
thank God, they are not spoiled by their
wives so much.

27:28.821 --> 27:31.561
They don’t have so much of conditioning,
they can eat anything.

27:31.762 --> 27:34.811
I’ve seen that when they come on the India
tour,

27:35.012 --> 27:37.685
all the Indians say, “Horrid food was given

27:37.886 --> 27:42.009
and the poor things were eating that horrid
food and this and that.”

27:42.210 --> 27:45.242
And I asked them, “Which place you like
the best?”

27:45.443 --> 27:47.667
They said, “Brahmapuri.” I said, “Eh? They
were saying

27:47.868 --> 27:50.604
Brahmapuri had the worst food and everybody
is complaining.”

27:50.805 --> 27:52.465
“No, no. Brahmapuri was the best,

27:52.666 --> 27:55.649
because we could bathe in the river and we
could sing

27:55.850 --> 27:59.476
and we could enjoy it!” You see, that’s
the sign of one thing,

27:59.677 --> 28:05.605
to get rid of your bad habits of food
business.

28:05.899 --> 28:11.697
Now the second part is for the body you
need comforts.

28:11.898 --> 28:15.193
I must congratulate the Western Sahaja
Yogis

28:15.393 --> 28:19.914
that they may be coming from any walk
of life –

28:20.115 --> 28:23.137
I must say, the Indians have to learn
from them –

28:23.337 --> 28:27.000
they may be coming from any position
or status.

28:27.201 --> 28:34.221
All of them enjoy the comfort of the Spirit
when they travel in the Tour.

28:34.422 --> 28:37.742
They do not ask for, “I haven’t got
a chair,

28:37.942 --> 28:42.087
I haven’t got a bed, I haven’t got a proper
things here.”

28:42.288 --> 28:45.217
In this way, you see, you will realise

28:45.418 --> 28:50.581
that the body comfort is of no importance.

28:50.782 --> 28:53.925
It’s, we have just spoilt our body, there’s
no need, no need.

28:54.126 --> 28:56.730
Body you put it anywhere, will sleep
in any case.

28:56.931 --> 28:59.534
If you cannot sleep for two nights,

28:59.735 --> 29:02.110
alright, put on some music for one night
or two nights

29:02.311 --> 29:06.409
as we had here, you will sleep anyway!

29:17.019 --> 29:26.974
So this is the second point is that we have
to give up body comfort.

29:27.175 --> 29:31.575
But the third point where I think
the Western people falter

29:31.776 --> 29:36.643
is their materialistic attitude.
Materialistic attitude

29:36.844 --> 29:44.198
and their fondness of their eyes. So one
of them is the worst of all.

29:44.399 --> 29:47.629
I mean, the worst in worst of all is that
you can never have,

29:47.830 --> 29:50.667
that’s such a big blot if you have that,

29:50.868 --> 29:54.573
is to have a roving eye and things like
that.

29:54.774 --> 29:58.573
It’s out of question. That’s out of
question for women or for men.

29:58.774 --> 30:01.592
They are not Sahaja Yogis by any chance.

30:01.793 --> 30:06.772
They have to have very clean eyes.

30:06.973 --> 30:09.059
That part is alright.

30:09.260 --> 30:13.349
And the second part is the greed, lust
and greed.

30:13.550 --> 30:17.990
Of course, with Sahaja Yoga maybe the lust
part is over,

30:18.191 --> 30:24.830
but greed is still there with so many who
get lost.

30:25.031 --> 30:28.652
So I would say Indians do not have this
lust problem,

30:28.853 --> 30:33.959
but they still have greed, greed problem –
means they want to buy something

30:34.160 --> 30:39.794
like a radio or some electrical stuff they
must buy.

30:39.995 --> 30:42.034
If they come abroad they must buy
something.

30:42.235 --> 30:45.521
It’s alright, if you get it, well and good,
if they don’t get it, well and good.

30:45.722 --> 30:48.599
It should be [that attitude]. But for
a Westerner, you see,

30:48.800 --> 30:54.228
he would not like to give up his furniture,
which his great grandmother had it.

30:54.429 --> 30:56.796
Though he can’t sit on it because it’s so
old.

30:56.997 --> 31:00.399
If he sits on it, it will break. But he
must keep it to show off that,

31:00.600 --> 31:04.130
“I had a great grandmother who gave this
unique chair.”

31:04.331 --> 31:08.983
According to Indian standards it’s junk!
Absolute junk.

31:09.184 --> 31:11.871
Because it is good for nothing you put it
in the drawing room,

31:12.072 --> 31:15.030
nobody can sit on it and it looks junky.

31:15.231 --> 31:18.350
But according to the Western mind the older
it is, the better –

31:18.551 --> 31:21.929
whether it is a junk or anything – he’ll
have so many junks in the house

31:22.130 --> 31:24.253
and then they will sell like hot cakes.

31:24.454 --> 31:27.541
Because there’s a very subtle materialistic
attitude

31:27.741 --> 31:31.063
towards matter that, “This will sell like
hot cakes if I sell it”,

31:31.264 --> 31:36.249
because there must be another mad Westerner
who would like to buy that junk. You see?

31:36.450 --> 31:40.454
So this junk that you have in the house
it’s better to get rid of,

31:40.655 --> 31:43.838
because God knows how many people must
have used [it].

31:44.039 --> 31:46.922
It’s like a grave in the house. It’s
a grave.

31:47.123 --> 31:50.470
So to have then also the antique jewellery.

31:50.671 --> 31:57.643
Antique jewellery is another mad, antique
is a – what you can say –

31:57.844 --> 32:02.446
is the fad or addiction of the Western
people – antique.

32:02.647 --> 32:06.887
For us nothing is antique because we still
produce antique things, beautiful things

32:07.088 --> 32:09.229
so Indians don’t understand the value
of antiques.

32:09.430 --> 32:12.603
They don’t understand how these people
are so mad

32:12.804 --> 32:17.684
after torn things and broken things and
dirty things and filthy things!

32:17.885 --> 32:21.053
But the Western mind has been brought up
that way.

32:21.254 --> 32:23.140
Now, in these antique things I have seen
that,

32:23.341 --> 32:25.612
once I went to somebody’s house, you see,

32:25.813 --> 32:29.155
and he asked Me with very great honour
to sit on his chair.

32:29.356 --> 32:31.996
And as soon as I sat on the chair I thought
there were snakes

32:32.197 --> 32:34.916
and there were scorpions all biting Me.

32:35.117 --> 32:37.462
I got a fright, I got up. I said, “What
is it?”

32:37.663 --> 32:40.331
He said, “This is from great, great,
great grandmother, you see,

32:40.532 --> 32:46.065
she gave us this thing.” I said, “It will
break, I’d better sit outside.”

32:46.852 --> 32:50.228
So this also madness of this antique
is so much

32:50.429 --> 32:55.836
that it is unbelievable how people go
into it.

32:56.037 --> 33:01.016
So there’s a joke in India there’s a very
great writer

33:01.217 --> 33:04.846
called as Premchand, he wrote about two
Englishmen

33:05.047 --> 33:12.058
going on the road of Benares when they were
hit by a lota (metal pot),

33:12.259 --> 33:19.069
that they use for their bathrooms, fell
on their feet. And it fell on their feet.

33:19.269 --> 33:24.715
And jokingly he says, “on the feet where
all the bureaucrats fall.”

33:24.916 --> 33:28.072
Means, all Indian bureaucrats used to fall
at the feet of the English at that time!

33:28.273 --> 33:30.623
So he made a joke. But doesn’t matter.

33:30.824 --> 33:32.611
Then the English, you see, looked at that
thing

33:32.811 --> 33:35.026
and they were very angry and immediately
they took to law,

33:35.227 --> 33:38.586
“You have to come to the courts, you have
to come to the police

33:38.787 --> 33:43.259
and we’re going to report this has fallen
there, it has hit us,” and all that.

33:43.460 --> 33:47.895
So there was a clever man, he knew
the English or the Western mind,

33:48.096 --> 33:53.972
he said, “Sir, do you know this, this lota
has very valuable!” He said, “Why?”

33:54.173 --> 33:59.305
“Because this one was used by Akbar
the Great. So ancient it is”.

33:59.506 --> 34:04.060
He said, “Really?” “Yes it is and, you
know, you just don’t quarrel with them.

34:04.260 --> 34:08.665
And ask them for this lota.” And he told
in Indian language to them that,

34:08.866 --> 34:13.808
“I have befooled these people, I have told
them that this lota belonged to Akbar

34:14.009 --> 34:23.635
and you have to take this lota and use this
lota to just to befool them.”

34:23.836 --> 34:26.729
So then they asked, “But alright, we’ll
forgive you,

34:26.930 --> 34:31.936
we’ll not take you to any courts or
anything, but you just give us this lota.”

34:32.137 --> 34:34.233
They said, “No, we can’t.” He said, “Why?”

34:34.434 --> 34:35.964
“Because it’s such an antique piece,
you see.”

34:36.165 --> 34:38.875
In India you won’t find anybody respecting
antique pieces,

34:39.076 --> 34:41.867
especially in Benares nobody bothers.

34:42.068 --> 34:45.228
So they said, “Really?”, “Yes, it belonged
to Akbar

34:45.428 --> 34:48.986
and, you know, my father was, my
forefathers worked with him,

34:49.187 --> 34:51.837
so he gave us this lota, we can’t give you,
we are sorry, you see.”

34:52.038 --> 34:55.629
“No, no, no, no, please give us, you see,
and we’ll no take you to the police.”

34:55.830 --> 34:58.482
“Alright, you charge us, whatever money
you charge us,” and all that.

34:58.683 --> 35:01.202
In those days they paid one thousand
rupees, you see,

35:01.403 --> 35:03.630
this is equal to, now, one crore
(10 million), I think.

35:03.831 --> 35:07.260
They gave, these English paid them and
bought that lota,

35:07.460 --> 35:11.733
which had nothing to do with Akbar or
anyone.

35:11.934 --> 35:15.563
So this madness of antique has to go away
from our minds.

35:15.764 --> 35:21.967
It’s such a built-in thing within us, that
we always talk of antiquities.

35:22.168 --> 35:25.081
Perhaps maybe because of wars everything
was destroyed

35:25.282 --> 35:28.996
and whatever was in the olden times was
something very beautiful and good

35:29.197 --> 35:32.818
and now we are not making very good
things, perhaps, maybe that is the reason.

35:33.019 --> 35:35.838
But now we are making nice things, we can
make.

35:36.039 --> 35:39.163
Now in England I was surprised the old
crafts are coming up,

35:39.364 --> 35:41.915
everywhere I go the old crafts are coming
up.

35:42.116 --> 35:48.893
So to respect antiques means you just
stop making the old craft revive.

35:49.094 --> 35:51.037
Because you pay so much to the antiques,

35:51.237 --> 35:55.750
the same thing made today won’t fetch
the same price as it was.

35:55.951 --> 35:59.443
Now this has ruined our creativity,

35:59.644 --> 36:05.557
ruined our handwork and it has ruined our
whole – I think the quality of our life,

36:05.757 --> 36:09.626
because the way we are mad after antiques.

36:09.827 --> 36:15.891
So this also should go from your head that
anything antique is something good.

36:16.092 --> 36:19.988
It’s a very superficial value – if you see
to it.

36:20.189 --> 36:23.287
Because people think that antique is
something expensive.

36:23.488 --> 36:27.134
It’s just a marketing style that people
have felt

36:27.335 --> 36:30.529
that this is expensive, that is expensive,
so it’s something great

36:30.730 --> 36:37.927
to wear something stupid and to say that,
“this is antique jewellery,” and go about.

36:38.128 --> 36:41.434
I mean, God knows how many people must
have used it and must have worn it

36:41.635 --> 36:44.602
and what must be the feelings of that
person.

36:44.803 --> 36:49.906
So we have to understand that this
conditioning that we have in our heads,

36:50.107 --> 36:59.444
that we must have something antiques with
us, keep something of such value.

36:59.645 --> 37:03.385
I mean, these questions never arose before,
so it’s not written in any books.

37:03.586 --> 37:08.360
Anyone of the books of the Gurus is not
written that, “Don’t care for antiques.”

37:08.561 --> 37:12.340
They have written, “Don’t drink, don’t
smoke,”

37:12.541 --> 37:15.461
all other things which spoils your Nabhi.

37:15.662 --> 37:17.909
They’ve written all these things. But they
have not written

37:18.110 --> 37:20.928
that, “Don’t worry about antiques so much.”

37:21.129 --> 37:23.822
You see, and I find that’s a craze nowadays

37:24.023 --> 37:28.230
and so we have to tell people that we have
to be careful.

37:28.431 --> 37:31.593
Moreover I feel the way people have gone
to drugs and that,

37:31.794 --> 37:33.687
maybe that because they used so much
antiques

37:33.887 --> 37:36.770
that the bhoots from the antiques must
have caught them.

37:36.971 --> 37:39.712
Can’t understand that why people are
so melancholy,

37:39.913 --> 37:42.075
all the time crying, weeping, and all that.

37:42.276 --> 37:46.886
So the conditionings of these matter as
we think it to be

37:47.087 --> 37:49.935
is to be absolutely taken out.

37:50.136 --> 37:52.989
Of course, I mean in certain countries
we should say

37:53.190 --> 37:56.052
that the antique things [that] were made
were good and nice.

37:56.253 --> 37:59.517
But, only because something is antique it
should not be respected,

37:59.718 --> 38:06.031
[but] because of its intrinsic value
of aesthetics, it’s alright.

38:06.232 --> 38:11.013
But one has to see first of all
the vibrations of everything.

38:11.214 --> 38:15.081
If the vibrations are good then you should
accept, otherwise not,

38:15.282 --> 38:19.045
because we have the language of vibrations

38:19.246 --> 38:24.082
and we have to use the language
of vibrations.

38:24.283 --> 38:28.301
Once you start using the language
of vibrations you’ll be surprised

38:28.502 --> 38:35.018
how you will get the complete picture
as to what is to be done.

38:39.044 --> 38:45.978
So to get rid of these three conditionings
too, for our body is very important.

38:46.179 --> 38:52.450
And the worst thing for a Sahaja Yogi [is]
to think that he’s sick:

38:52.651 --> 38:57.436
is a, sort of a, tarnishing the name
of Sahaja Yoga.

38:57.637 --> 39:02.753
If you still feel you are sick you better
get out of Sahaja Yoga!

39:03.426 --> 39:10.108
Because either you get well or you are not
a Sahaja Yogi, one of the two things.

39:10.309 --> 39:13.167
If you are a Sahaja Yogi you have to see
that you get well

39:13.368 --> 39:16.295
and if there are certain problems also –
doesn’t matter.

39:16.496 --> 39:19.772
Now, for example, supposing, I have certain
problems,

39:19.973 --> 39:22.586
which I know, because of Sahaja Yoga,

39:22.787 --> 39:27.876
because of My position as the Mother,
position as Adi Shakti:

39:28.107 --> 39:30.550
certain physical things I have to face,

39:30.751 --> 39:33.366
parasympathetic working I have to face,

39:33.567 --> 39:36.167
but I go through it! Is accepted.

39:36.368 --> 39:40.868
You have to accept your body as it is
and you are not to sort of say that,

39:41.068 --> 39:43.784
“I’m not well,” and “There’s something
rong with me,”

39:43.985 --> 39:47.687
and go on complaining like some old hag!

39:47.888 --> 39:50.460
Never think you are old, first of all.

39:50.661 --> 39:55.473
Never think that you have gone old or you
are no good.

39:55.674 --> 39:58.086
Look at your Mother. I never think that
way.

39:58.287 --> 40:02.046
Yesterday half of you were sleeping, still
I was alert

40:02.247 --> 40:05.363
and listening to the music and today I’m
again alert here.

40:05.564 --> 40:09.924
So if you have a Guru then that image
should be with you that:

40:10.125 --> 40:14.381
“Look at our Mother. She’s so old, how much
She travels, how much She does!”

40:14.582 --> 40:16.504
Alright, you might say, She’s the Adi
Shakti!

40:16.705 --> 40:19.093
But little bit of shakti you too have.

40:19.294 --> 40:25.830
And that shakti is to be shown by your
full dynamism.

40:26.031 --> 40:29.513
If you have no dynamism and if you still
feel very weak

40:29.714 --> 40:31.646
that means you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

40:31.847 --> 40:37.581
So just ask for, ask for any amount of
energy – it can come to you.

40:37.782 --> 40:39.446
That dynamism, it should be there.

40:39.647 --> 40:43.015
Now this I would say, for the physical
self that one has to know

40:43.216 --> 40:46.376
that you are all younger and getting
younger and younger,

40:46.577 --> 40:52.811
but not the stupidity of youth, but
gravity, the gravity of the age.

40:53.012 --> 40:57.653
Actually I have seen children who are
born realised,

40:57.854 --> 41:03.790
they are very grave, they won’t do anything
that is not dignified.

41:03.991 --> 41:09.012
And they will never, I’ve never heard them
talking to some of –

41:09.213 --> 41:10.781
the Sahaja Yoginis have a bad habit
of talking,

41:10.982 --> 41:12.490
“tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk,” among
themselves.

41:12.691 --> 41:18.061
It’s a very bad habit. Which shows that
they [are] still very much lacking.

41:18.262 --> 41:21.810
Just wearing saris or wearing bindis you do
not become a Sahaja Yogini.

41:22.011 --> 41:23.574
First of all, what is the gravity?

41:23.774 --> 41:26.490
You should only speak whenever it is
necessary.

41:26.691 --> 41:31.496
So I have seen these Sahaja Yogis who are
born realised children

41:31.697 --> 41:33.655
they stand like this before Me.

41:33.856 --> 41:38.074
And they say very few words, but beautiful
words they speak.

41:38.275 --> 41:42.142
And say things, which you can remember
all the time.

41:42.343 --> 41:45.335
They just do not go on wasting anything.

41:45.536 --> 41:47.591
And they are extremely obedient.

41:47.792 --> 41:51.087
So from them one can learn that these are
born realised

41:51.288 --> 41:56.559
and the way their Guru principle is acting,
are we also acting the same way?

41:56.760 --> 42:00.756
Or we are doing something that is not good
for our ascent?

42:00.957 --> 42:04.414
So even after coming to Sahaja Yoga if you
do not try hard

42:04.615 --> 42:07.318
to introspect yourself, you have missed
the point

42:07.519 --> 42:10.140
that you compare yourself with your Guru –
all the time.

42:10.341 --> 42:14.881
Now. Then everything has to be understood

42:15.081 --> 42:18.323
in the right perspective that we are Sahaja
Yogis.

42:18.524 --> 42:20.685
Now for a Sahaja Yogi first and foremost
thing

42:20.886 --> 42:27.236
[is] that he has to have love. First. For
others, not for himself.

42:27.437 --> 42:29.775
If you are all the time worried about
yourself,

42:29.976 --> 42:33.158
“My body is such, my this thing such, and
I have to do this and that,”

42:33.359 --> 42:37.683
then you don’t love others. But do you see
to the comfort of others?

42:37.884 --> 42:40.791
Do you feel the compassion of other
Sahaja Yogis?

42:40.992 --> 42:44.240
Do you feel, “What have I to bring for
them? What is missing in them?”

42:44.441 --> 42:50.397
Do you work it out? Do you go out of
the way to help them?

42:50.667 --> 42:56.490
First of all Sahaja Yogis. Now Sahaja
Yogis are different things.

42:56.691 --> 43:01.264
I have seen many Sahaja Yogis will go and
take the side of the non-Sahaja Yogis

43:01.465 --> 43:05.244
and try to debase the Sahaja Yogis.
Is a very wrong thing.

43:05.445 --> 43:08.131
You belong to this new race

43:08.332 --> 43:12.648
and the people who do not belong to this
new race and if they are attacking anybody:

43:12.849 --> 43:16.965
these are your hands, your feet, your head,
and if they attack it,

43:17.166 --> 43:21.929
it is duty bound that you help them instead
of helping the others.

43:22.130 --> 43:24.619
Maybe something wrong with this person,
doesn’t matter.

43:24.820 --> 43:27.610
You need not show all the fair play there.

43:27.811 --> 43:31.265
In that place you should support a Sahaja
Yogi out and out.

43:31.466 --> 43:34.382
Later on you may correct and you may
tell that person,

43:34.583 --> 43:37.660
“You should not have done like this,
it was wrong.”

43:37.861 --> 43:42.603
So this dignity and this understanding
comes only through silence.

43:42.804 --> 43:47.330
But if you are chirping all the time,
talking “tuktuk, tuktuk, tuktuk, tuktuk,”

43:47.531 --> 43:51.730
it can never, never can make you a deeper
person.

43:51.931 --> 43:54.584
You’ll be just flying in the air with
all that.

43:54.785 --> 43:57.475
So for women now is best is to take
to mauna,

43:57.676 --> 44:00.669
is to keep quiet, just keep quiet.

44:00.870 --> 44:02.916
They all the time want to talk.

44:03.117 --> 44:07.470
This I’ve heard from all the leaders that
it’s a big problem with women.

44:07.671 --> 44:10.799
They just go on talking stories, telling
stories.

44:11.000 --> 44:17.371
But if you ask them to come and speak,
they will start shaking.

44:17.764 --> 44:23.217
How many can give speeches? Women?

44:23.418 --> 44:30.901
If you understand that if you cannot give
a speech, you better not talk also.

44:31.362 --> 44:35.381
You should be able to give a speech because
your Mother is a woman, She gives speeches.

44:35.582 --> 44:37.725
Why can’t you give some speech? You cannot.

44:37.926 --> 44:40.640
If I make you stand here, you’ll be
shaking, I know that.

44:40.841 --> 44:44.342
But if it comes to murmuring souls, you
are there.

44:44.543 --> 44:47.226
So that is one thing women have to be very
careful [about].

44:47.427 --> 44:50.119
And as today is the Guru puja I have
to tell you things,

44:50.320 --> 44:53.248
not as a Mother but as your Guru.

44:53.449 --> 44:58.030
That, if you have to ascend the best thing
is for you to stop talking.

44:58.231 --> 45:02.171
“Maunam sarvartha sadhanam.” ‘Maun’ means
to keep quiet.

45:02.372 --> 45:08.662
It gives you all kinds of facilities, just
keep quiet.

45:08.863 --> 45:11.998
If somebody’s talking too much, just keep
quiet.

45:12.199 --> 45:14.763
If somebody’s trying to criticise, keep
quiet.

45:14.964 --> 45:16.796
That’s your silence, that’s your right,

45:16.996 --> 45:20.403
that’s your domain that you can keep
silent.

45:20.604 --> 45:22.511
Just watch that person.

45:22.712 --> 45:27.228
If it comes then to answer, then you can
answer better.

45:27.429 --> 45:31.962
But if somebody’s trying to attack, you
just keep silent.

45:32.163 --> 45:34.483
But this silence has to be established

45:34.684 --> 45:38.581
and one should only establish by not
talking too much.

45:38.782 --> 45:43.252
I have seen also when I am sitting here, I
have seen women talking among themselves,

45:43.453 --> 45:46.979
and this is very wrong. You must learn
the silence.

45:47.180 --> 45:50.825
Like yesterday I saw so many ladies also
were walking out, walking in.

45:51.026 --> 45:54.384
In the church will you do that? You won’t
do it.

45:54.585 --> 45:58.365
In the church there is no Christ, there’s
a horrible priest sitting there

45:58.566 --> 46:02.933
but you cannot do it. You all keep quiet,
you sit there nicely.

46:03.134 --> 46:05.866
I’ve never seen anybody walking out here
and there

46:06.067 --> 46:09.482
and doing all kinds of things, putting
the children in front like that,

46:09.683 --> 46:14.519
making them sleep. Never! Can you do that
in the church?

46:16.229 --> 46:20.619
What a discipline people observe in that
church, which is an artificial place.

46:20.820 --> 46:25.603
And where you are now, that kind of
a silence has to be there

46:25.804 --> 46:29.389
and that kind of understanding, that depth,
that awe has to be there.

46:29.590 --> 46:32.075
But because we have not yet developed
that Guru thing.

46:32.276 --> 46:34.927
If you have developed it then immediately
it will work out.

46:35.128 --> 46:39.377
You will see your gravity will show in your
behaviour.

46:39.578 --> 46:52.631
So this is for our attention not to be
wasted.

46:52.832 --> 46:56.799
To discuss somebody, to discuss about
others’ characters, we have no business.

46:57.000 --> 47:00.739
Do we discuss the character of one hand
to another hand?

47:00.940 --> 47:04.483
To discuss about what has happened about
marriages, things like that.

47:04.684 --> 47:09.456
Also marriage is just… in Sahaja Yoga it’s
not such an important thing.

47:09.657 --> 47:11.899
Some people pay too much attention
to marriage, you see,

47:12.100 --> 47:15.366
and marriage becomes a headache. Also
then, “What about my marriage?”

47:15.567 --> 47:18.435
Then again ten minutes you see that person,
“What about my marriage?”

47:18.636 --> 47:20.484
Again after ten minutes, “What about
my marriage?”

47:20.685 --> 47:23.481
You want to run away. I mean, you see,

47:23.682 --> 47:27.412
it’s something becomes like a mania for
people, “What should we do?”

47:27.628 --> 47:30.784
And the whole thing is, all depends, and
the whole programming

47:30.984 --> 47:33.513
depends on how you are going to get
married.

47:33.714 --> 47:39.005
So you have come to Sahaja Yoga, you
are sanyasis.

47:40.997 --> 47:43.841
You are not married people in a way.

47:44.042 --> 47:45.924
You are married only to Sahaja Yoga,

47:46.125 --> 47:48.481
that’s your husband, that’s your wife.

47:48.682 --> 47:52.479
And the so-called husband and wife are
there.

47:52.680 --> 47:57.197
But if they are not Sahaja Yogis then you
are unmarried, definitely.

47:57.398 --> 48:00.543
So too much attention is paid in Sahaja
Yoga to marriages.

48:00.744 --> 48:06.883
I have seen that before, marriage, before
Sahaja Yoga,

48:07.084 --> 48:10.652
marriage was a joke; every third day there
was a divorce

48:10.853 --> 48:15.278
and people would run away and do all kinds
of things.

48:15.479 --> 48:19.420
Then when they got married after Sahaja
Yoga

48:19.621 --> 48:22.946
they are the greatest romantic people ever
known in the whole world!

48:23.147 --> 48:26.505
I mean, all ‘Romeo, Juliets’ going about.
I just don’t understand.

48:26.706 --> 48:28.893
Even in the Indian villages people complain
that,

48:29.094 --> 48:32.120
“What sort of these people are? I mean,
they have no sense at all

48:32.321 --> 48:34.998
and the way they go round, are they
the saints?”

48:35.199 --> 48:42.251
So that saintliness, that sanyasta, that
asceticism

48:42.451 --> 48:44.930
has to be expressed in our married life.

48:45.131 --> 48:48.307
I don’t mean that you don’t have
relationship with your husband

48:48.508 --> 48:53.105
but in a very private way. It’s has to be
extremely private

48:53.306 --> 48:57.936
and it should not be such a great thing
to go into romanticism.

48:58.137 --> 49:02.304
You’ll ruin the whole of Sahaja Yoga in the
West if you start doing that nonsense!

49:02.505 --> 49:08.550
Because also there’s an idea about it that,
you see, you fall in love.

49:08.751 --> 49:11.234
But then you’ll fall! That’s the first
point is.

49:11.435 --> 49:13.214
You will fall [but] you want to rise.

49:13.415 --> 49:18.167
So this attachment and this worry about
the husband and this and that,

49:18.368 --> 49:21.573
I mean, you can carry on with any kind of a
husband and wife if you are a Sahaja Yogi,

49:21.774 --> 49:25.835
should be able to. I mean, I know that’s
very simple.

49:26.036 --> 49:29.151
It’s a… your husband is a study, wife is
a study, that’s all.

49:29.352 --> 49:31.621
You study a person, what sort of a person
he is.

49:31.822 --> 49:34.056
But for that you have to have the witness
state

49:34.257 --> 49:36.198
and you have to see, you have to be
detached.

49:36.399 --> 49:40.193
So in marriages one has to be detached.

49:40.394 --> 49:43.842
But, on the contrary, I find that just
after the marriage

49:44.042 --> 49:46.822
they want to organise some special thing
for them

49:47.023 --> 49:52.603
to go to some sort of a honeymoon or some
sort of a thing!

49:52.804 --> 49:54.761
I don’t know how these ideas crawl up.

49:54.962 --> 49:57.729
These are coming from the old conditionings
of things

49:57.930 --> 49:59.549
and after honeymoon they come and say,

49:59.750 --> 50:01.951
“Mother, this marriage is not going
to work out.”

50:02.152 --> 50:05.940
So it’s better to do slow and steady and
then decide.

50:06.141 --> 50:09.342
Because you just jump into honeymoon mood
and come back and say,

50:09.543 --> 50:13.655
“Mother, this, I have started thinking and
I don’t think.”

50:13.856 --> 50:18.120
I know of a lady who was jumping with
a Indian gentleman

50:18.320 --> 50:21.876
and she was on her way to Australia. In
Singapore, she telephones that,

50:22.077 --> 50:24.666
“Mother, I don’t think this marriage will
work out.”

50:24.867 --> 50:26.947
And here everybody complained to Me,
“Mother,

50:27.148 --> 50:32.584
these two are behaving in such a manner
that Indians are rather embarrassed.”

50:32.785 --> 50:36.306
So the sense of shame you must learn
from Indians.

50:36.507 --> 50:40.328
They’d never… husband and wife never sit
together in India

50:40.529 --> 50:43.583
is regarded as bad manners and it should
be with you also.

50:43.784 --> 50:48.384
That, even in the puja, even in anything
they are sitting in the public.

50:48.591 --> 50:52.743
What is the need to show your relationship
in the public?

50:52.944 --> 50:55.937
It’s only in the private. This is one
of the things one,

50:56.138 --> 51:00.308
if you start understanding, there will be
a proper adjustment.

51:00.509 --> 51:03.493
Men should be with men in the public,

51:03.694 --> 51:07.638
women should be with the women together.

51:07.839 --> 51:10.645
But the women or men, whatever they are

51:10.846 --> 51:17.261
whatever are their bad, bad points should
not be brought back.

51:17.462 --> 51:24.762
Like, I would say the men have jealousies
and they have power orientation

51:24.963 --> 51:29.991
and they discuss about leadership and they,
every, they get a shock

51:30.192 --> 51:32.212
if you tell them that you are not going
to be a leader,

51:32.412 --> 51:35.583
as if they think leadership is something
very concrete.

51:35.784 --> 51:39.641
It’s the greatest myth ever going, is this
leadership!

51:39.842 --> 51:44.845
There’s nothing like leaders in this Sahaja
Yoga, it’s just a joke.

51:45.046 --> 51:48.318
And your Mother is very good at playing
serious jokes.

51:48.519 --> 51:53.252
So be careful! Don’t be childish about it.

51:53.453 --> 51:56.208
You have to understand that this is a big
joke going on

51:56.409 --> 52:01.560
and it’s just a testing point and if I test
you wrong,

52:01.761 --> 52:03.892
you can tell Me, but I think this has
worked well,

52:04.093 --> 52:06.686
because I can test people very well on that
level

52:06.886 --> 52:11.255
and immediately I know when the person
gets onto the horse of ego.

52:11.456 --> 52:16.403
So, for your mental attitude, has to be
different

52:16.604 --> 52:19.946
and our priorities have to change.

52:20.147 --> 52:23.195
Our priorities have to change. What are
our priorities?

52:23.396 --> 52:28.613
First and foremost thing is our ascent, is
the first priority.

52:28.814 --> 52:31.276
For our ascent whatever is needed has to be
done.

52:31.477 --> 52:33.509
If you have to punish your body, alright.

52:33.710 --> 52:36.020
If you have to punish yourself, alright.

52:36.221 --> 52:42.930
If you have a conditioning, get rid of it.
Just introspect yourself,

52:43.131 --> 52:45.975
that is Self-realisation, is to know your
Self.

52:46.176 --> 52:47.572
When you know your Self and know

52:47.773 --> 52:52.781
what is clinging onto it, just to remove it
completely.

52:52.982 --> 52:55.874
Work it out the way you like. Work it out
the way you like.

52:56.075 --> 53:06.491
You see, it is very important that
the body, mind,

53:07.356 --> 53:11.342
everything should be your slaves.

53:11.543 --> 53:16.401
Nothing should dominate you. You should be
on top of everything.

53:16.602 --> 53:19.383
How dare your body ask for anything?

53:19.584 --> 53:22.426
How dare your mind tells you anything?

53:22.627 --> 53:24.769
How this conditioning works on you?

53:24.970 --> 53:27.487
“I am a Sahaja Yogi, I’m above everything.”

53:27.688 --> 53:32.976
Like the lotuses have come out of the
ponds, you have come out of it.

53:33.177 --> 53:39.212
We have so many proofs to show that you
are realised souls.

53:39.413 --> 53:43.336
I’ll show you some photographs that I have
to show that there is light.

53:43.537 --> 53:46.562
I can put light into you, they are all
enlightened people.

53:46.763 --> 53:48.899
But in My presence if you become the light,

53:49.100 --> 53:50.797
you must carry the light outside.

53:50.998 --> 53:53.967
Not only in My presence, but when you go
out.

53:54.168 --> 53:58.630
But one of the reasons, I think, when I
tell something people just start thinking

53:58.831 --> 54:03.277
about whom Mother is talking, they never
think, “She is talking about me.

54:03.478 --> 54:06.285
That’s the only way you can penetrate
within yourself

54:06.486 --> 54:08.745
when you see that, “Mother is talking
about me,

54:08.946 --> 54:11.836
She’s correcting me all alone and She’s
telling me.”

54:12.037 --> 54:15.941
Then only it will penetrate and it will
work out.

54:16.142 --> 54:19.886
The priorities have to be changed and
the first and foremost

54:20.087 --> 54:23.926
is your ascent and the Spirit and Sahaja
Yoga.

54:24.127 --> 54:28.831
The rest is negligible, nothing important.

54:31.411 --> 54:38.715
Then the faith that there is this
All-pervading Power,

54:38.916 --> 54:42.755
which is looking after us, is very
important.

54:42.956 --> 54:44.727
This time the musicians came all the way.

54:44.928 --> 54:47.241
I must tell you the story of their travel.

54:47.445 --> 54:51.038
They came and they said that there’s
a train from Kiev

54:51.239 --> 54:53.728
and they also bought the tickets so got
into the train

54:53.929 --> 54:59.137
and they were off-loaded before
the Hungarian border.

54:59.338 --> 55:02.526
They didn’t know what to do, they had
no visas, nothing

55:02.727 --> 55:05.549
and not so much money also. They thought,
“We are on the train.”

55:05.750 --> 55:07.725
They said, “No, you have to go cross over

55:07.926 --> 55:09.645
and go to Budapest,” and they didn’t
know where,

55:09.845 --> 55:13.873
they were standing on the road. And,
but they were all laughing

55:14.074 --> 55:17.186
and enjoying, “must be something in store
for us.”

55:17.387 --> 55:19.729
Nobody felt that they were in trouble
or in anything.

55:19.930 --> 55:22.714
So surrendered. “So, suddenly,” they said,

55:22.915 --> 55:25.207
“the custom people came and surrounded
them,” and they said,

55:25.408 --> 55:29.588
“What’s the matter, how are you here
with all these bags and baggage?”

55:29.789 --> 55:33.523
So they said, “Why are you here?” They
said, “We have come for a concert and this,

55:33.724 --> 55:37.866
and musicians we are and all.” And some
or other they started melting away.

55:38.067 --> 55:39.975
And then they gave them Realisation!

55:40.176 --> 55:44.397
Six of them got Realisation. Now can you
believe: the power of love.

55:44.598 --> 55:50.513
And the custom officers they offered their
own cars, took them down to the other side.

55:50.714 --> 55:53.215
It’s never happened with custom officers!
Imagine!

55:53.416 --> 55:56.905
It would be like shaving their teeth off,
I tell you,

55:57.106 --> 56:03.417
the way if you can do that to the custom
officer! But it happened.

56:03.618 --> 56:06.618
And they came to the other side and left
them there.

56:06.819 --> 56:09.155
Now they didn’t know what to do. They
wanted to go to Budapest,

56:09.356 --> 56:13.053
they had to walk about two miles or
something to the station.

56:13.254 --> 56:18.023
So they were waiting there well, they
said that, “Mother, You sent maybe,

56:18.224 --> 56:24.099
two Yugoslavs came in a big bus of 49
people – all vacant.”

56:24.300 --> 56:27.258
They stopped the bus and said, “What is it,
why are you here?”

56:27.459 --> 56:29.459
So they said, “This is our problem and we
have to go.”

56:29.660 --> 56:32.963
So they got into the bus. When he was
driving them down,

56:33.164 --> 56:36.976
they thought of talking to him that, “Why
not you take us to Milan?”

56:37.177 --> 56:40.168
And they managed!

56:41.276 --> 56:45.237
And they were in Milan. It’s so remarkable.

56:45.438 --> 56:48.807
So to have faith completely in yourself

56:49.008 --> 56:52.793
and in that Power, which is surrounding
you.

56:52.994 --> 56:56.951
And once you have that faith you will
realise that,

56:57.152 --> 57:01.617
that, though it is so helpful to you, it is
so kind to you,

57:01.818 --> 57:09.739
on the same level if you think it, it can
be very harmful.

57:09.940 --> 57:14.565
So then never listen to the Guruninda,

57:14.766 --> 57:17.542
means anybody talks anything ill about
your Guru,

57:17.743 --> 57:22.523
just put your hands to your ears,
absolutely, immediately.

57:22.724 --> 57:25.546
I have known of a person who did that
[and] got cancer,

57:25.747 --> 57:28.181
another now in jail, another one there.

57:28.382 --> 57:31.392
So anybody is saying like that just put
your hands.

57:31.593 --> 57:35.719
Because now you know that – what is your
Guru.

57:35.920 --> 57:41.787
So you should never hear anything against
your Guru from anyone.

57:41.988 --> 57:45.286
The other day one gentleman asked Me
a question, a newsman.

57:45.487 --> 57:49.036
He said that, “I am told you have made
a castle for Yourself.”

57:49.237 --> 57:51.201
I said, “I have paid for it, I have made it
also.

57:51.402 --> 57:54.423
It was a horrid place, no doubt. But there
are only Sahaja Yogis staying there,

57:54.624 --> 57:58.560
I am not staying there. That’s the best
part.” But that’s all I said.

57:58.761 --> 58:03.805
But on the contrary, they never go and ask
these questions to any gurus on anything.

58:04.006 --> 58:06.851
Because the disciples say, “Yes, so what?
We want to give

58:07.052 --> 58:09.724
to our guru money and this and that.”
They never ask.

58:09.925 --> 58:13.352
But, through Sahaja Yoga, or [by] Myself,
have cured

58:13.553 --> 58:17.654
so many people of incurable diseases –
I could have minted money.

58:17.855 --> 58:22.828
For curing one cancer patient I could have
made a castle, Myself.

58:23.029 --> 58:24.822
So when people say like that you should
say,

58:25.022 --> 58:28.995
“Do you know how many people She has
cured? How much money She could have taken

58:29.195 --> 58:34.411
from them if She was a doctor or She was
a false guru?

58:34.612 --> 58:37.550
How much money She would have made
out of all of them?”

58:37.751 --> 58:40.410
Then they will understand. You see, because
they are being

58:40.611 --> 58:45.518
materialistic they talk like that. And
their attitude is very different

58:45.736 --> 58:48.444
and so, to tell them off is the best way.

58:48.645 --> 58:53.962
Because I have seen that these press people
are absolutely harassed

58:54.163 --> 58:59.217
by the disciples of the false Gurus. Just
they cannot criticise,

58:59.418 --> 59:01.842
they cannot say a word against such
false Gurus.

59:02.043 --> 59:05.068
While I find that Sahaja Yogis still lack

59:05.268 --> 59:11.310
that complete faith in themselves and
complete assertion.

59:11.511 --> 59:15.011
Where you have to assert you must assert.

59:15.212 --> 59:19.996
For example, anybody says something wrong
against Me, you have to assert;

59:20.197 --> 59:24.378
must say, “No, not possible. It’s not!” But
I have seen some people

59:24.578 --> 59:28.194
asking Me funny questions who are ‘Sahaja
Yogis’ also!

59:28.395 --> 59:36.523
So the first part is that to see how much
we are sensitive to spirituality.

59:36.724 --> 59:40.252
I have seen Sahaja Yogis supporting
somebody who is so negative,

59:40.452 --> 59:45.804
you can’t even bear that person and, [to
them], such a person is something great,

59:46.005 --> 59:49.369
while somebody who is so good they cannot
make it out.

59:49.570 --> 59:52.945
So what’s the use? Your computer is so
faulty, you’ll do…

59:53.146 --> 59:55.239
I mean, the planes will have to run up
and down

59:55.439 --> 59:58.112
if you have such a computer as Sahaja
Yogis are!

59:58.326 --> 01:00:01.130
Because they just judge the other way
round.

01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:04.806
A person who is good in Sahaja Yoga, who
has got vibrations,

01:00:05.006 --> 01:00:07.119
he may be simple, he may be unassuming,

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:10.020
he may not be so rich, he may not be
so educated,

01:00:10.221 --> 01:00:13.593
may not be from some good universities
or anything,

01:00:13.794 --> 01:00:16.558
but you must see the vibrations of that
person!

01:00:16.759 --> 01:00:20.538
What sort of vibrations that person has,
and then you should judge.

01:00:20.739 --> 01:00:25.832
Instead of that if you judge that person
only because he’s very good to talk

01:00:26.033 --> 01:00:30.342
and he talks well and very scholarly or
something like that, that’s not the point.

01:00:30.543 --> 01:00:34.140
The point is what are his vibrations! And
once you see those vibrations

01:00:34.341 --> 01:00:37.875
and judge them on vibrations, then you are
a Sahaja Yogi,

01:00:38.076 --> 01:00:40.681
otherwise I would not call you at all
a Sahaja Yogi.

01:00:40.919 --> 01:00:44.186
But for a Guru it is very important.
I have seen sometimes

01:00:44.387 --> 01:00:48.499
even the leaders supporting somebody
who is absolutely horrid!

01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:51.729
I can’t bear that person even for five
minutes!

01:00:51.930 --> 01:00:54.122
But here the guru sends him over to Me,

01:00:54.323 --> 01:00:59.005
“Oh, Mother, he’s so good, you know, he
donated so much money.”

01:00:59.206 --> 01:01:02.246
It doesn’t matter. You donated money,
so what?

01:01:02.447 --> 01:01:04.283
Who asked him to donate money?

01:01:04.484 --> 01:01:07.270
But he should not donate his bhoots to us
now anymore!

01:01:07.471 --> 01:01:09.858
We don’t want his bhoot! So that’s what
it is.

01:01:10.059 --> 01:01:13.256
So the judgment should be correct about
a person

01:01:13.457 --> 01:01:17.145
when you say that this man is not good
or that is not good.

01:01:17.346 --> 01:01:19.721
But mostly ‘gurus’ themselves are caught up

01:01:19.922 --> 01:01:24.684
and then they are ambitious and if somebody
doesn’t listen to them

01:01:24.885 --> 01:01:28.312
or somebody wants to give a lecture
at a wrong time and somebody says,

01:01:28.513 --> 01:01:31.604
“You shouldn’t talk like this,” or
something, then they get angry.

01:01:31.805 --> 01:01:36.308
They are very hot tempered and they provoke
people, they say things sometimes.

01:01:36.509 --> 01:01:39.439
And then when people react they say,
“You are a bad Sahaja Yogi.”

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:43.282
That’s not the way. First of all a guru
or a leader

01:01:43.483 --> 01:01:49.446
has to be himself a very mild, gentle, and
a good person.

01:01:49.647 --> 01:01:52.532
He has to be in such a way [that] he should
not demand anything,

01:01:52.733 --> 01:01:56.206
should not ask for anything. Never demand
anything!

01:01:56.407 --> 01:02:01.191
Anybody who demands cannot be a guru.

01:02:01.509 --> 01:02:04.561
Respect is to be commanded and not
to be demanded.

01:02:04.762 --> 01:02:11.302
And so, everything works out well if you
understand that –

01:02:11.503 --> 01:02:14.870
once you rise in your ascent, in your
wisdom,

01:02:15.070 --> 01:02:19.826
in your awareness and in your Spirit –
automatically all these things happen!

01:02:20.035 --> 01:02:23.627
You don’t have to ask for anything, you
don’t have to plead for anything,

01:02:23.828 --> 01:02:26.495
you don’t have to complain for anything,
everything works out.

01:02:26.696 --> 01:02:31.160
You are looked after by all the ganas,
by all the angels.

01:02:31.369 --> 01:02:33.563
They are there. You are on the stage.

01:02:33.764 --> 01:02:36.272
But if you are halfway then they play
tricks with you.

01:02:36.473 --> 01:02:40.114
You see, they play tricks, they make you
falter, you have problems,

01:02:40.315 --> 01:02:43.410
you go here, you go there, all these
things happen

01:02:43.611 --> 01:02:45.835
and then you say, “Mother, how is it
this happened?”

01:02:46.036 --> 01:02:49.973
Because they are also jokers, so they play
jokes with you

01:02:50.174 --> 01:02:54.800
and they make problems for you just to make
you understand that you are doing wrong.

01:02:55.001 --> 01:02:59.518
So we are on a stage where there’s
a beautiful security,

01:02:59.719 --> 01:03:03.860
everything is there and we have to give
to the world

01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:05.876
such a great thing like Sahaja Yoga,

01:03:06.077 --> 01:03:09.437
which is for the emancipation of the whole
world, as you realise,

01:03:09.638 --> 01:03:12.958
and so also I hope you realise your
responsibilities.

01:03:13.175 --> 01:03:18.237
There are so many things one has to
understand, how one has to be as a guru,

01:03:18.452 --> 01:03:21.274
how he has to act and how he has to work
out.

01:03:21.475 --> 01:03:23.867
Now I have given so many lectures
on Guru things,

01:03:24.068 --> 01:03:27.400
but, for today’s lecture, only I have
to say

01:03:27.601 --> 01:03:32.995
that, first thing, to have a guru system,

01:03:33.196 --> 01:03:35.916
you must have complete humility.

01:03:36.117 --> 01:03:41.285
Now, with Me, I would say, I am too simple

01:03:41.486 --> 01:03:44.858
and I am Mahamaya, so you be very careful.

01:03:45.074 --> 01:03:49.439
You cannot take liberties with Me. You
cannot take.

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:54.411
If you try to take too much liberties that
means you are not a disciple.

01:03:54.612 --> 01:03:58.503
A disciple has to keep a distance from
the Guru.

01:03:58.704 --> 01:04:01.400
You cannot just take liberties, walk into
My room every time,

01:04:01.601 --> 01:04:04.892
sit there for hours together, chit-chat
with Me – nothing!

01:04:05.093 --> 01:04:06.639
You have no right.

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:12.470
Only when I call you, when I ask for you,
you should come.

01:04:12.671 --> 01:04:15.343
Then you should not force things on
the Guru that,

01:04:15.544 --> 01:04:20.749
“Please, come and listen to this,” or,
“Do this!” that should not be said.

01:04:20.965 --> 01:04:23.324
For example, yesterday nobody told Me there
are going to be

01:04:23.524 --> 01:04:25.999
these music programs or everything
arranged.

01:04:26.208 --> 01:04:30.924
So you have to report everything to your
leader, or to Me,

01:04:31.125 --> 01:04:34.760
all those things that you want to do.
And it should be really transparent.

01:04:34.961 --> 01:04:37.330
Like this hand knows everything that this
hand is doing,

01:04:37.531 --> 01:04:39.769
and this hand knows everything that this
hand is doing.

01:04:39.970 --> 01:04:42.979
In the same way everybody should know
each other.

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:48.631
Then the gurus should not have jealousies
for each other.

01:04:48.902 --> 01:04:52.431
This I’m just telling you because also
I found out

01:04:52.632 --> 01:04:56.953
that there are certain jealousies. And when
they talk there is a little bit of,

01:04:57.154 --> 01:05:00.695
“Ha, he’s good, but this, this, this.”

01:05:00.896 --> 01:05:03.437
When they enjoy each other’s company

01:05:03.638 --> 01:05:06.059
because they have reached a certain state

01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:08.093
and they understand, “This is the state
we are in.”

01:05:08.294 --> 01:05:12.550
When they enjoy each other’s company fully
and appreciate each other

01:05:12.751 --> 01:05:17.959
much more than anybody else – the guru’s
company.

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:24.807
All the company of the leaders, if they
enjoy each other

01:05:25.008 --> 01:05:29.225
and there’s no jealousy, there’s no fight,
there’s no problem

01:05:29.426 --> 01:05:31.048
but just the enjoyment of the company,

01:05:31.249 --> 01:05:34.008
then they should know that they have
become a guru.

01:05:34.209 --> 01:05:37.259
Now all of them never fought with each
other. They supported.

01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:40.716
Actually it is one Principle was born again
and again.

01:05:40.917 --> 01:05:46.443
But only the satanic people – they’ll fight
among themselves, not the godly.

01:05:46.644 --> 01:05:52.161
And also they will talk against the person
who is a realised soul

01:05:52.362 --> 01:05:55.400
or who is an Incarnation, but never
against themselves.

01:05:55.601 --> 01:05:59.333
It’s very surprising that the satanic
people,

01:05:59.534 --> 01:06:01.723
though they fight among themselves, there
are jealousies,

01:06:01.924 --> 01:06:04.403
they’ll never talk of each other.

01:06:04.604 --> 01:06:07.919
But here I find that in Sahaja Yoga we
have freedom.

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:10.590
But freedom is not abandonment,
is the freedom

01:06:10.814 --> 01:06:14.092
with complete rules and regulations
of the Divine, with us,

01:06:14.355 --> 01:06:18.397
and we have to know them that this is
the Divine Law.

01:06:18.598 --> 01:06:24.396
So all of us are now sitting like in a big
vimana, like an aeroplane,

01:06:24.597 --> 01:06:28.117
and we all have to land into the beautiful
area.

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:34.423
But first of all we have to develop that
humility in your heart;

01:06:34.624 --> 01:06:37.885
complete humility and surrender, that’s
very important.

01:06:38.086 --> 01:06:42.042
Unless and until you have that humility
and surrender in your heart,

01:06:42.243 --> 01:06:45.157
Guru principle cannot be awakened.

01:06:45.358 --> 01:06:48.924
First you have to be the disciple and then
the guru.

01:06:49.125 --> 01:06:51.678
So you have to develop that humility.

01:06:51.879 --> 01:06:58.470
And that humility comes very easily if
you love Me, respect Me.

01:06:58.671 --> 01:07:02.716
It’s not only love, but respect.

01:07:03.304 --> 01:07:09.434
That respect has to be there and then
people will respect you.

01:07:09.635 --> 01:07:12.004
May God bless you.
