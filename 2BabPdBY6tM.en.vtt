00:07:42.572 --> 00:07:50.622
Today's puja is very important for us.

00:07:50.622 --> 00:07:55.112
You all have got your Self Realization.

00:07:55.112 --> 00:08:03.122
You have all the knowledge that is necessary
to give Realizations to others.

00:08:03.122 --> 00:08:08.982
You have to know what you have already.

00:08:08.982 --> 00:08:16.942
That's very important, because if you do not
try your hand and if you do not try to give

00:08:16.942 --> 00:08:24.572
Realizations to others, firstly you'll have
no faith in yourself.

00:08:24.572 --> 00:08:30.272
You'll have no self-esteem also.

00:08:30.272 --> 00:08:41.162
The second part is that you try giving vibrations
to other persons, but don't get involved with

00:08:41.162 --> 00:08:43.662
that person.

00:08:43.662 --> 00:08:47.582
I've seen some people get too much involved.

00:08:47.582 --> 00:08:52.252
If they give Realization to one person, they
think they have done a great job and they

00:08:52.252 --> 00:08:58.252
start working on that person, his family,
his relations, this thing.

00:08:58.252 --> 00:09:05.702
So, so far as you must have learned, that
one may be related, one may be closer to one

00:09:05.702 --> 00:09:21.022
person, but not necessarily he will have that
much of chance of Self Realization.

00:09:21.022 --> 00:09:23.452
Only way to grow is to be collective.

00:09:23.452 --> 00:09:26.371
There's no other way out.

00:09:26.371 --> 00:09:32.172
If people think that by staying away from
ashrams, alone living somewhere they will

00:09:32.172 --> 00:09:38.971
achieve much - that's not the way Sahaja Yoga
is meant.

00:09:38.971 --> 00:09:47.602
Formerly, people used to go to Himalayas and
most of them were separated and only one or

00:09:47.602 --> 00:09:52.052
two persons were chosen for spiritual growth.

00:09:52.052 --> 00:10:00.522
Here it is not question of spiritual growth,
it's a question of your collectivity growing

00:10:00.522 --> 00:10:02.862
in you.

00:10:02.862 --> 00:10:12.892
That is how you become a person who is collective,
who enjoys collective, who works on collective

00:10:12.892 --> 00:10:15.412
and lives with collective.

00:10:15.412 --> 00:10:23.022
Such a person develops new kind of powers.

00:10:23.022 --> 00:10:37.311
And these powers are such that they are very
subtle, but they penetrate into any molecule,

00:10:37.311 --> 00:10:43.072
atom or human beings, anywhere.

00:10:43.072 --> 00:10:51.201
And their penetration is only possible if
you have a temperament which is collective.

00:10:51.201 --> 00:11:01.481
Without being fully collective, you cannot
achieve that height which is very necessary

00:11:01.481 --> 00:11:03.642
today for Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:03.642 --> 00:11:11.622
As you know, there are problems and problems
all over, as if you feel that the world is

00:11:11.622 --> 00:11:12.722
going to sink.

00:11:12.722 --> 00:11:19.512
Specially when I went to America I felt that
"My goodness, this is a hell that they have

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:20.552
created here."

00:11:20.552 --> 00:11:27.652
Is just a hell because they have no dharma,
they don't believe in any dharma, completely

00:11:27.652 --> 00:11:35.171
they worship adharma and this kind of climate
is flowing all over.

00:11:35.171 --> 00:11:42.802
All over the world, you get reaction of American
adharmic life.

00:11:42.802 --> 00:11:46.061
And people think there's nothing wrong in
it.

00:11:46.061 --> 00:11:51.862
Whatever you may tell them, they will not
believe nor they will think that there's any

00:11:51.862 --> 00:11:52.862
verdict.

00:11:52.862 --> 00:12:00.311
But they don't see the destruction from the
very basis of their life, their families,

00:12:00.311 --> 00:12:02.702
their societies.

00:12:02.702 --> 00:12:13.311
The whole country, I feel, is filled with
such ugly type of adharmic nature, that one

00:12:13.311 --> 00:12:20.332
cannot even imagine how such ideas came into
their heads.

00:12:20.332 --> 00:12:24.322
And these ideas I need not tell you, you know
them very well.

00:12:24.322 --> 00:12:30.812
But if you have to save your children, you
have to be an ideal guru yourself.

00:12:30.812 --> 00:12:41.381
If you just talk of Sahaja Yoga and if you
try to assume that you are a Sahaja Yogi,

00:12:41.381 --> 00:12:47.952
also you try to propagate Sahaja Yoga without
all these powers being awakened in you, it

00:12:47.952 --> 00:12:49.901
would be a failure.

00:12:49.901 --> 00:13:00.642
So, how to develop these powers within us
we should see.

00:13:00.642 --> 00:13:06.281
It's rather embarrassing for Me to tell you
how you have to behave towards your Guru.

00:13:06.281 --> 00:13:09.191
I think people have told you.

00:13:09.191 --> 00:13:16.052
But naturally, spontaneously, as soon as you
get your Realization and grow in it, naturally

00:13:16.052 --> 00:13:19.411
you develop a very humble attitude.

00:13:19.411 --> 00:13:33.931
Also an attitude through which you achieve
lots of

00:13:33.931 --> 00:13:36.212
qualities of your Guru.

00:13:36.212 --> 00:13:42.512
Now, supposing the Guru is at a particular
height and if you try to go on to the same

00:13:42.512 --> 00:13:47.121
height, nothing will move towards you.

00:13:47.121 --> 00:13:55.341
So you must sit at a place which is much lower
than the Guru's is.

00:13:55.341 --> 00:14:01.762
Some people take too much advantage of My
good nature, I should say, and so many people

00:14:01.762 --> 00:14:05.944
have pointed out to Me that "You must correct
these people, they talk to You at equal level

00:14:05.944 --> 00:14:06.944
and all that."

00:14:06.944 --> 00:14:11.401
I said: "They will learn a lesson, they will
learn a lesson."

00:14:11.401 --> 00:14:18.241
But sometimes, it doesn't work out and they
start talking on the same manner as if you

00:14:18.241 --> 00:14:23.082
are talking to your friend or to your equal.

00:14:23.082 --> 00:14:25.992
First is complete humility.

00:14:25.992 --> 00:14:28.051
You have to be a humble person, extremely
humble.

00:14:28.051 --> 00:14:39.441
Now, you check on that, when you talk to others,
are you humble?

00:14:39.441 --> 00:14:43.251
When you think of others, are you humble?

00:14:43.251 --> 00:14:49.631
When you look after your wife and children,
are you humble?

00:14:49.631 --> 00:15:01.892
That's a very important thing for every person
who thinks he is a Guru.

00:15:01.892 --> 00:15:09.191
Humility is the first quality or, I should
say, the ocean into which you must jump.

00:15:09.191 --> 00:15:14.691
Some people think that "If you are humble,
Mother, then people will take advantage of

00:15:14.691 --> 00:15:16.612
you."

00:15:16.612 --> 00:15:22.331
Nobody can take advantage of you, because
you have to remember another point, that you

00:15:22.331 --> 00:15:28.471
are protected all the time, looked after by
Param Chaitanya.

00:15:28.471 --> 00:15:36.211
I know you know that, but how many really
believe that there is Param Chaitanya with

00:15:36.211 --> 00:15:37.211
us?

00:15:37.211 --> 00:15:46.061
If you really believe that there is Param
Chaitanya, then you don't get frightened,

00:15:46.061 --> 00:15:53.431
you don't get worried, you are not subjected
to all kinds of nonsensical ideas also.

00:15:53.431 --> 00:15:59.141
But if you think that you are not protected,
"What will happen?

00:15:59.141 --> 00:16:06.051
How will things happen?" then Param Chaitanya
leaves you alone.

00:16:06.051 --> 00:16:20.502
You have to see the whole drama, how Param
Chaitanya works out, how It works out, how

00:16:20.502 --> 00:16:21.502
you are behaving.

00:16:21.502 --> 00:16:34.072
Supposing you are not in a proper shape and
you try to show off too much, then what happens?

00:16:34.072 --> 00:16:37.872
Then, you get the reward for it.

00:16:37.872 --> 00:16:43.322
Not that I do anything, but it is the Param
Chaitanya which will teach you a lesson that

00:16:43.322 --> 00:16:48.601
you will remember, that you should have been
little different from what you have been.

00:16:48.601 --> 00:16:54.361
After all, we have to know why have we come
to Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:54.361 --> 00:16:56.601
Begin at the root of it.

00:16:56.601 --> 00:17:04.142
We have come to Sahaja Yoga because we wanted
to know the absolute truth, and this absolute

00:17:04.142 --> 00:17:09.991
truth has been now known to you through your
vibrations.

00:17:09.991 --> 00:17:18.421
You know it through your vibrations, what
is the absolute truth, and you should work

00:17:18.421 --> 00:17:30.481
everything on that line, that absolute truth,
whatever you feel on your vibrations you have

00:17:30.481 --> 00:17:31.772
to follow.

00:17:31.772 --> 00:17:37.752
Unfortunately, I have seen many people think
that their vibrations are all right, they

00:17:37.752 --> 00:17:42.132
are all right and whatever they are receiving
on their vibrations is first class.

00:17:42.132 --> 00:17:46.522
Now, how to correct that point is very difficult.

00:17:46.522 --> 00:17:48.072
It comes from ego.

00:17:48.072 --> 00:17:52.932
When you have ego, you can never find anything
wrong with you.

00:17:52.932 --> 00:17:57.382
And even if the vibrations are telling you
something, it might be somebody else who is

00:17:57.382 --> 00:18:04.231
telling you something, because you are not
there, your ego is there and your ego is just

00:18:04.231 --> 00:18:12.882
spoiling you and teaching you things which
normally you would see clearly that "I'm doing

00:18:12.882 --> 00:18:16.062
something wrong, I should not have done it."

00:18:16.062 --> 00:18:26.651
In this process of correction and improvement,
when you indulge you should see: "Are you

00:18:26.651 --> 00:18:29.031
getting subtler or grosser?"

00:18:29.031 --> 00:18:30.762
That is the best way to judge.

00:18:30.762 --> 00:18:42.231
Now, I've seen people who go on judging on
small things like vibrations - whether this

00:18:42.231 --> 00:18:49.502
vibration are all right or not in this tree
or on this flowers or on this land, all kinds

00:18:49.502 --> 00:18:52.272
of material things they want to see the vibrations.

00:18:52.272 --> 00:18:55.142
But for what are you seeing the vibration?

00:18:55.142 --> 00:19:02.572
You are seeing vibration because some sort
of material gain.

00:19:02.572 --> 00:19:07.411
You think that if you check the vibrations
and the vibrations are all right, then you

00:19:07.411 --> 00:19:13.151
are quite safe, you will not loose this, will
not loose that.

00:19:13.151 --> 00:19:15.242
It's not true.

00:19:15.242 --> 00:19:21.791
Because vibrations are not meant to judge
all these worldly things and worldly matters.

00:19:21.791 --> 00:19:25.942
It's absolutely cheapening the vibrations.

00:19:25.942 --> 00:19:33.562
You should not cheapen them, because vibrations
can suggest things which may be detrimental

00:19:33.562 --> 00:19:36.402
to your growth very much.

00:19:36.402 --> 00:19:42.392
Once, I wanted somebody to go somewhere, so
he said, "I didn't go, Mother."

00:19:42.392 --> 00:19:43.392
I said, "Why?"

00:19:43.392 --> 00:19:45.832
"Because I saw the vibrations were very bad."

00:19:45.832 --> 00:19:48.841
I said, "That's why I asked you to go.

00:19:48.841 --> 00:19:56.392
If the vibrations were good, what was your
use going there?

00:19:56.392 --> 00:20:01.692
That's the reason I asked you to go there
so that you could help but before that you

00:20:01.692 --> 00:20:06.202
judged yourself, judged your vibrations and
then you didn't want to go."

00:20:06.202 --> 00:20:11.341
So, what happens, we want to have a easy,
cozy life.

00:20:11.341 --> 00:20:17.942
And all our problems must be solved by Sahaja
Yoga, otherwise we think Sahaja Yoga is of

00:20:17.942 --> 00:20:18.942
no use.

00:20:18.942 --> 00:20:22.572
Whatever is our desire must be fulfilled.

00:20:22.572 --> 00:20:25.832
So, now the desires are mostly personal.

00:20:25.832 --> 00:20:32.502
"My child is not well, so the child should
be all right, my husband is misbehaving, the

00:20:32.502 --> 00:20:38.461
husband should be all right" or "I have no
house, I must get a house."

00:20:38.461 --> 00:20:46.002
See how we are moving our mind, is still on
a very consumer society, as they call it.

00:20:46.002 --> 00:20:53.872
We are all the time thinking, "Now I should
have a son, now, instead of a girl" and you

00:20:53.872 --> 00:20:58.721
get a son and then you blame Sahaja Yoga for
that!

00:20:58.721 --> 00:21:05.122
Anything that according to your desire doesn't
work out, then you think it's Sahaja Yoga

00:21:05.122 --> 00:21:06.861
which has done the harm and you are suffering
because of Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:06.861 --> 00:21:18.392
Or this faith in Sahaja Yoga gets little moving
or we can say, in a way, it's not that deep.

00:21:18.392 --> 00:21:27.491
But if you are deeply imbedded in Sahaja Yoga,
then what happens?

00:21:27.491 --> 00:21:34.822
"What may come, I will be a Sahaja Yogi."

00:21:34.822 --> 00:21:41.312
Supposing somebody dies, normally in Sahaja
Yoga it's difficult for people to die also,

00:21:41.312 --> 00:21:42.782
I must tell you.

00:21:42.782 --> 00:21:46.812
Even if they want to die, they can't die.

00:21:46.812 --> 00:21:49.731
It's the Param Chaitanya which decides for
you.

00:21:49.731 --> 00:21:57.002
But supposing you take up a position like
that, still you must know that that wish may

00:21:57.002 --> 00:21:58.002
not be fulfilled.

00:21:58.002 --> 00:22:10.392
If that is not fulfilled then you feel disturbed
and you think, "What's wrong?"

00:22:10.392 --> 00:22:27.911
But your wish is not the wish of God Almighty,
while Param Chaitanya is the wish of God Almighty.

00:22:27.911 --> 00:22:31.502
Now for example I went to America, take it
like this, and America attacked Me.

00:22:31.502 --> 00:22:35.171
Negativity and troubled Me.

00:22:35.171 --> 00:22:44.762
For all these days I'm suffering so-called,
and I have had pain, I have had all kinds

00:22:44.762 --> 00:22:45.762
of things.

00:22:45.762 --> 00:22:52.361
But that I had to do because now the American
Sahaja Yogis will realize how much one has

00:22:52.361 --> 00:23:00.671
to pay to make this dumb head of Americans
to rise.

00:23:00.671 --> 00:23:11.231
How stupid they are and how foolish they are
who are enamored by people who are taking

00:23:11.231 --> 00:23:13.291
money!

00:23:13.291 --> 00:23:20.991
So many people came to Me and told Me, "Mother,
if You start saying that, this I can give

00:23:20.991 --> 00:23:28.041
for 300 dollars, You'll get thousands and
thousands of disciples of Yours."

00:23:28.041 --> 00:23:32.192
I said, "They'll not be My disciples.

00:23:32.192 --> 00:23:37.512
If they come for money, thinking that because
I'm taking money it is worthy something, that

00:23:37.512 --> 00:23:41.462
means they are absolutely stupid!"

00:23:41.462 --> 00:23:47.712
Sahaja Yoga, you cannot get it by money, this
is the first principle they don't understand,

00:23:47.712 --> 00:23:49.082
most of them!

00:23:49.082 --> 00:23:58.241
Most of them don't understand that you can
get Self Realization without paying any money.

00:23:58.241 --> 00:24:07.722
They were some Gujarati rich people in New
Jersey and they asked questions to Sahaja

00:24:07.722 --> 00:24:11.152
Yogis that "How is it possible to get it so
easily?

00:24:11.152 --> 00:24:17.132
It's not possible because it's a very difficult
thing, all the shastras have said, everybody

00:24:17.132 --> 00:24:20.682
has said, it's very difficult to get your
Realization.

00:24:20.682 --> 00:24:21.682
All right!

00:24:21.682 --> 00:24:26.692
If so, how is it you are giving it so easily?

00:24:26.692 --> 00:24:28.592
Why?"

00:24:28.592 --> 00:24:31.382
Nobody knew how to answer to these people.

00:24:31.382 --> 00:24:37.582
You should have said like this, "All right
it is difficult, very difficult and you cannot

00:24:37.582 --> 00:24:39.161
give mass, true!

00:24:39.161 --> 00:24:45.161
But if somebody is doing it, then you have
to think about it, how somebody is doing it?"

00:24:45.161 --> 00:24:50.822
So, this kind of stupid questions are there
and still if they go on, you have really to

00:24:50.822 --> 00:24:57.021
tell them in a very humble way: "Sir, one
has to be worthy also."

00:24:57.021 --> 00:25:02.952
So, they will run after people who are just
making money out of them, making fool out

00:25:02.952 --> 00:25:03.952
of them.

00:25:03.952 --> 00:25:05.502
And they boast, "We have three gurus."

00:25:05.502 --> 00:25:08.092
Somebody says, "We have seven gurus!"

00:25:08.092 --> 00:25:12.242
And I wonder what must be their condition.

00:25:12.242 --> 00:25:17.342
So the people who are extremely stupid, in
Sanskrit they call "[SOUNDS LIKE MURLE OR

00:25:17.342 --> 00:25:25.271
MOOHL]" people who are brainless cannot get
their Realization, so give them up.

00:25:25.271 --> 00:25:31.852
If they are arguing with you, you just give
them up.

00:25:31.852 --> 00:25:34.552
It's not their right to argue with you.

00:25:34.552 --> 00:25:41.332
Their right is to get Realization but not
a right to argue with you, ask you foolish

00:25:41.332 --> 00:25:43.641
questions and stupid questions.

00:25:43.641 --> 00:25:48.621
But you should always remember that with that
humility you must have your dignity intact

00:25:48.621 --> 00:25:49.992
because you are a Guru.

00:25:49.992 --> 00:25:59.632
Once you know you are a Guru, one thing should
be there that you will not behave like a joker

00:25:59.632 --> 00:26:00.932
all the time.

00:26:00.932 --> 00:26:03.891
Your behavior will be dignified.

00:26:03.891 --> 00:26:11.732
At the same time, it will be very pleasant
face or a pleasant personality.

00:26:11.732 --> 00:26:13.252
It won't be annoying type.

00:26:13.252 --> 00:26:18.052
Your personality itself will suggest that
there's something special about you.

00:26:18.052 --> 00:26:31.152
Now, how do you develop that kind of a personality?

00:26:31.152 --> 00:26:38.542
The biggest problem in the West is ego and
the biggest problem in the East is superego.

00:26:38.542 --> 00:26:45.042
Now, this ego business, I don't know from
where it has come.

00:26:45.042 --> 00:26:49.241
In all walk of life, they show how egoistical
they are.

00:26:49.241 --> 00:26:57.162
For example, I went to America and I was surprised
that there is a racial problem, and the blacks

00:26:57.162 --> 00:26:59.682
are treated in a different manner, and the
whites in a different manner.

00:26:59.682 --> 00:27:06.602
I mean, color is given by God and somebody
has to be black, and white.

00:27:06.602 --> 00:27:10.082
If everybody looked the same, it will look
like a regiment.

00:27:10.082 --> 00:27:19.492
There should be some variety, there should
be some change in the face and also in the

00:27:19.492 --> 00:27:20.492
expression.

00:27:20.492 --> 00:27:32.152
One has to be a person carrying better or
different expressions, otherwise you will

00:27:32.152 --> 00:27:37.182
be bored with such a world where there is
everybody looks the same, just the same.

00:27:37.182 --> 00:27:45.761
But so much of racialism there that I was
surprised that how it has worked into human

00:27:45.761 --> 00:27:46.761
mind.

00:27:46.761 --> 00:27:54.872
So, as a Guru, you must develop a complete
detest for racialism, complete detest.

00:27:54.872 --> 00:28:03.902
That's very easy to understand that anybody
who has fair complexion could be a cruelest

00:28:03.902 --> 00:28:09.751
man, cruelest woman and could be a cruelest
mother also.

00:28:09.751 --> 00:28:15.162
And the one who is black could be very kind,
generous.

00:28:15.162 --> 00:28:21.172
It doesn't go with the color, temperament
doesn't go with the color.

00:28:21.172 --> 00:28:26.582
But because the blacks have been ill-treated
so much that they react.

00:28:26.582 --> 00:28:34.722
And they react, naturally, in sometimes in
such a manner that it is very crude and very

00:28:34.722 --> 00:28:35.722
cruel.

00:28:35.722 --> 00:28:48.641
But this kind of attention, this kind of a,
you can say, a wrong type of attitude towards

00:28:48.641 --> 00:28:52.981
human beings, even towards animals they won't
bear it.

00:28:52.981 --> 00:28:59.792
So towards human beings to have such an attitude
itself shows that you are not worthy of Sahaja

00:28:59.792 --> 00:29:01.602
Yoga at all.

00:29:01.602 --> 00:29:12.772
So anyone of you who has such a feeling that
somebody is black and somebody is white cannot

00:29:12.772 --> 00:29:18.432
be a guru in Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:18.432 --> 00:29:23.712
Then in India we have caste system, equally
bad and horrible.

00:29:23.712 --> 00:29:31.891
It has no sense in it, no basis whatsoever,
but in India we have people who believe that

00:29:31.891 --> 00:29:35.631
some castes are higher and some castes are
lower.

00:29:35.631 --> 00:29:43.223
Every caste people can do all the worst possible
things, there is no demarcation for them and

00:29:43.223 --> 00:29:48.141
every low caste can be very, very good.

00:29:48.141 --> 00:29:55.761
We have had many great poets and Sufis in
the lowest castes in India.

00:29:55.761 --> 00:29:58.102
This castes are man-made.

00:29:58.102 --> 00:30:04.402
You know man-made cloth doesn't suit us, and
all these man-made ideas are not going to

00:30:04.402 --> 00:30:13.251
suit us and it will lead us into a great - I
wouldn't know discretion - but I would say

00:30:13.251 --> 00:30:24.521
to a complete destruction, because hatred
begets hatred and it goes on increasing and

00:30:24.521 --> 00:30:25.521
increasing.

00:30:25.521 --> 00:30:31.472
If you cannot get rid of your hatred, then,
I would say you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:30:31.472 --> 00:30:33.912
These are all conditionings.

00:30:33.912 --> 00:30:44.511
You were born in a white family, so you are
white, you were born in a Christian family

00:30:44.511 --> 00:30:50.013
that's why you are Christian, you were born
in a Jew family, that's why you are a Jew.

00:30:50.013 --> 00:30:51.182
All this is just because you were born in
that.

00:30:51.182 --> 00:30:56.991
But does that mean that you are higher or
lower?

00:30:56.991 --> 00:31:03.991
All the problems of the world today, if you
see, are because of human attachment to nonsensical

00:31:03.991 --> 00:31:06.502
ideas of superiority.

00:31:06.502 --> 00:31:12.722
Only through collective living will change.

00:31:12.722 --> 00:31:21.842
For example, I would say, in an ashram, we
should have all colored people living together

00:31:21.842 --> 00:31:29.241
with the equal rights, with the equal understanding
and love and affection.

00:31:29.241 --> 00:31:43.231
If that is not there, no use calling it an
ashram.

00:31:43.231 --> 00:31:50.302
Once, they asked Me, "Mother, will You come
and give a lecture in Harlem?"

00:31:50.302 --> 00:31:51.842
I said, "Why not?"

00:31:51.842 --> 00:31:53.641
So some Sahaja Yogis said, "Harlem?

00:31:53.641 --> 00:31:55.991
Mother, do You know what is Harlem?"

00:31:55.991 --> 00:31:57.111
I said, "I know.

00:31:57.111 --> 00:31:58.111
There's no harm."

00:31:58.111 --> 00:32:01.342
They said, "You know the blacks are there
and..."

00:32:01.342 --> 00:32:04.012
I said, "I'm also black."

00:32:04.012 --> 00:32:13.332
You could call Me black or you can call Me
white, but the love is such a thing, you see,

00:32:13.332 --> 00:32:20.152
love is such a thing that cleanses all these
ridiculous ideas we have about other people.

00:32:20.152 --> 00:32:27.512
To brand anyone as black and white shows that
you have no eyes to see.

00:32:27.512 --> 00:32:40.391
Any person with depth, any person with loving
heart cannot see these superficial things,

00:32:40.391 --> 00:32:42.692
cannot see!

00:32:42.692 --> 00:32:48.761
Today is a day where we are celebrating the
Guru's greatness.

00:32:48.761 --> 00:33:00.182
Now, look at all the Gurus, how they were,
how they behaved.

00:33:00.182 --> 00:33:06.172
We have many in India and many others many
Sufis in other countries.

00:33:06.172 --> 00:33:15.412
These Sufis or these saints that we had never
believed in any caste system, never believed

00:33:15.412 --> 00:33:17.282
in black and white.

00:33:17.282 --> 00:33:21.332
Christ, He never believed in black and white.

00:33:21.332 --> 00:33:26.282
Buddha never believed in black and white.

00:33:26.282 --> 00:33:34.572
Nobody believed in any kind of man-made ideas.

00:33:34.572 --> 00:33:43.891
These are all man-made ideas which we have
accepted and, even after Realization, we

00:33:43.891 --> 00:33:47.922
try to carry on with them.

00:33:47.922 --> 00:33:54.952
Now, by saying, we do not get rid of it, but
acting we can.

00:33:54.952 --> 00:34:06.371
Just see how we work out these stupid ideas
within us and how we can get rid of them.

00:34:06.371 --> 00:34:16.902
Very simple is in meditation you should sit
down and see how many people you love and

00:34:16.902 --> 00:34:27.332
why do you love, not out of pity, but just
with love, how much you care for others.

00:34:27.332 --> 00:34:34.092
I've seen some very beautiful examples of
that, but still I must say that there are

00:34:34.092 --> 00:34:41.862
certain fixed ideas which are to be dislodged
completely, very important for every person

00:34:41.862 --> 00:34:45.612
who is a Guru in Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:45.612 --> 00:34:50.152
Means he has to be a clean-hearted, open-hearted,
loving-hearted fellow.

00:34:50.152 --> 00:34:55.042
His heart should play the tune of Param Chaitanya.

00:34:55.042 --> 00:35:03.812
If his heart is full of all these man-made
ideas, I don't know what will happen.

00:35:03.812 --> 00:35:11.042
Even when they transplant the heart, they
cannot do it with a man-made, they have to

00:35:11.042 --> 00:35:13.062
use a real, natural one.

00:35:13.062 --> 00:35:25.361
So you can imagine when you try to take to
all these odd ideas, are just divisive, they

00:35:25.361 --> 00:35:28.982
will never give you collectivity.

00:35:28.982 --> 00:35:31.712
So, introspection has to be made.

00:35:31.712 --> 00:35:40.712
Are we one, or we are judging each other?

00:35:40.712 --> 00:35:47.612
Now, the judgment is quite a lot also.

00:35:47.612 --> 00:35:58.502
Now, all this can be seen only when you live
together, otherwise how will you know?

00:35:58.502 --> 00:36:07.542
When you start living together, you discover,
start discovering what is missing in you,

00:36:07.542 --> 00:36:10.891
what is not there, what has to be there.

00:36:10.891 --> 00:36:20.732
It is so peaceful to have a heart which is
full of love because every movement of that

00:36:20.732 --> 00:36:27.952
heart is so much joy giving, so much joy giving.

00:36:27.952 --> 00:36:41.062
There's a story of Shri Rama, that He ate
the bers, a kind of fruit, which were first

00:36:41.062 --> 00:36:45.472
tasted by an old lady with such love.

00:36:45.472 --> 00:36:46.592
Shows what?

00:36:46.592 --> 00:36:55.692
Shows that a person like Shri Ram Who was
the King of the highest heritage and this

00:36:55.692 --> 00:37:04.503
old lady who was just of the lowest caste
gives Him these fruits with such love, and

00:37:04.503 --> 00:37:08.152
when He eats that, He starts praising it.

00:37:08.152 --> 00:37:10.712
So His wife says, "Give me some!"

00:37:10.712 --> 00:37:17.292
He says, "All right," but the brother is still
half way, I think, in Sahaja Yoga, so he doesn't

00:37:17.292 --> 00:37:20.871
like, he doesn't like, he gets angry.

00:37:20.871 --> 00:37:22.601
Then She eats and She says, "Brother-in-law,
it's wonderful fruit, I must say!"

00:37:22.601 --> 00:37:25.231
He says, "All right, give me some."

00:37:25.231 --> 00:37:28.771
She says, "Why should I give you now?

00:37:28.771 --> 00:37:36.282
First you were a very much angry, so why should
I give you these fruits to eat?"

00:37:36.282 --> 00:37:47.932
The story shows that the level of your personality
as Guru is judged by your clean heart, by

00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:57.692
your loving heart, by your highest, remarkable
personality.

00:37:57.692 --> 00:38:03.231
In the personality it is not something that
is to be built-in artificially.

00:38:03.231 --> 00:38:10.071
It is not artificial; it is natural, absolutely
natural.

00:38:10.071 --> 00:38:14.991
Whatever you do has to be natural.

00:38:14.991 --> 00:38:23.932
So, this artificiality of certain ways of
talking or certain ways of living together

00:38:23.932 --> 00:38:25.282
creates problem.

00:38:25.282 --> 00:38:34.011
For example, we had a ashram in America, in
New York, and there was a lady who was very

00:38:34.011 --> 00:38:41.221
strict, everything should be tip-top, it should
be here, the spoons must be there and the

00:38:41.221 --> 00:38:45.822
forks should be here, and all sort of things
and she hurt many people.

00:38:45.822 --> 00:38:46.822
Not important.

00:38:46.822 --> 00:38:56.412
These cultural, what you can call it, the
taboos are not important in Sahaja Yoga, because

00:38:56.412 --> 00:38:59.261
now, you have become a Guru.

00:38:59.261 --> 00:39:04.761
Guru can stay anywhere, live anywhere, eat
anything, any time.

00:39:04.761 --> 00:39:06.302
That should be the case.

00:39:06.302 --> 00:39:14.932
But also I've seen in Sahaja Yoga, there are
many who are very anxious to eat food as soon

00:39:14.932 --> 00:39:16.302
as it is served.

00:39:16.302 --> 00:39:21.511
Once it happened, I was there, they had served
the food and just they started removing the

00:39:21.511 --> 00:39:22.511
plates.

00:39:22.511 --> 00:39:23.631
I said, "What's the matter, I have to eat."

00:39:23.631 --> 00:39:24.631
"Oh!

00:39:24.631 --> 00:39:25.631
You haven't eaten, Mother?"

00:39:25.631 --> 00:39:28.011
"No, I haven't yet touched it even."

00:39:28.011 --> 00:39:38.121
So, you see, sort of, first it is the very
lowest type of, we should say, desire, is

00:39:38.121 --> 00:39:39.121
the hunger.

00:39:39.121 --> 00:39:41.922
Now, a Guru doesn't bother.

00:39:41.922 --> 00:39:46.982
Whatever you give, all right, whatever he
wants not to give, all right.

00:39:46.982 --> 00:39:54.812
Even if you don't give is all right, but one
has to develop that by killing your ego.

00:39:54.812 --> 00:40:02.182
People feel very hurt if you serve them little
later than another person.

00:40:02.182 --> 00:40:06.962
It's all kinds of funny things I've seen in
Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:06.962 --> 00:40:14.241
On the contrary it is the lowest type of,
I should say, a desire.

00:40:14.241 --> 00:40:21.152
You should not be very much catered to, if
you want to be a real Guru.

00:40:21.152 --> 00:40:30.981
Of course, many problems are solved, as I
have seen so far that they do not take to

00:40:30.981 --> 00:40:38.542
drugs, they do not take to drinking and all
such things.

00:40:38.542 --> 00:40:43.192
You see, it's such a blessing, because if
I had to start from that level, I don't know

00:40:43.192 --> 00:40:47.192
how deep I would have gone, from where I would
have pulled you out.

00:40:47.192 --> 00:40:50.802
But that is of course a very big thing.

00:40:50.802 --> 00:40:57.702
That is quite a nice thing but still, to make
a beautiful life out of it which will attract

00:40:57.702 --> 00:41:04.271
the attention of everyone - how you talk,
how you behave, how you love.

00:41:04.271 --> 00:41:15.322
So, again one has to say that Guru Pada comes
only through the love that you have.

00:41:15.322 --> 00:41:25.771
Like they'll have, say, ten people for anything,
for a drama supposing, and they have it only

00:41:25.771 --> 00:41:35.131
from a particular country or from a particular
group, then there's no fun!

00:41:35.131 --> 00:41:37.112
There's no fun.

00:41:37.112 --> 00:41:42.822
For example they'll have a music group, so,
from the particular one caste could be or

00:41:42.822 --> 00:41:52.532
could be one religion, could be one, you can
say, one school or anything.

00:41:52.532 --> 00:41:56.942
So that shows that you are still not there.

00:41:56.942 --> 00:42:09.592
As a Guru, you should like every kind of culture,
every kind of beauty and that has to be brought

00:42:09.592 --> 00:42:13.502
in, in our daily life.

00:42:13.502 --> 00:42:23.882
You should not look down upon anyone for their
color, for their race, for their status, class

00:42:23.882 --> 00:42:24.912
consciousness.

00:42:24.912 --> 00:42:33.472
All this has been shown in the lives of all
these Guru saints who lived.

00:42:33.472 --> 00:42:39.832
Tukarama says, "Oh God, thank God you have
made me a Shidhul caste."

00:42:39.832 --> 00:42:46.412
He was not but he just says so.

00:42:46.412 --> 00:42:56.902
All of us, all the time should not be conscious
of what has been our birth, what has been

00:42:56.902 --> 00:43:04.022
our personality or what has been our beginning.

00:43:04.022 --> 00:43:12.022
One should not be able to make out even who
is the saint and who is not.

00:43:12.022 --> 00:43:17.472
Even people are proud that they are saints.

00:43:17.472 --> 00:43:24.432
I was surprised in America, also, very much
that the Russians who have gone there are

00:43:24.432 --> 00:43:26.182
a very different quality people.

00:43:26.182 --> 00:43:32.742
They wouldn't raise their eyes to Me, wouldn't
raise their eyes and very deep, very, very

00:43:32.742 --> 00:43:33.742
deep.

00:43:33.742 --> 00:43:35.382
Vibrations were very deep.

00:43:35.382 --> 00:43:43.732
The reason is, I think, they have been oppressed
during communism, perhaps, maybe, and now

00:43:43.732 --> 00:43:50.682
they have come to America where they have
seen so-called freedom and what nonsense it

00:43:50.682 --> 00:43:53.572
is doing.

00:43:53.572 --> 00:44:02.712
So knowing these two extremes, I think they
have gone very deep into their own being,

00:44:02.712 --> 00:44:11.502
and they have such strength and such unity
among themselves.

00:44:11.502 --> 00:44:18.162
I was surprised that I had never met them
before.

00:44:18.162 --> 00:44:24.372
They didn't come from Russia, they came, only
they were there.

00:44:24.372 --> 00:44:36.352
So, what is it that has kept them like that
is, that they had no religion in their heads.

00:44:36.352 --> 00:44:37.732
They had no religion.

00:44:37.732 --> 00:44:44.672
To them, every religion is the same and they
had no religion to follow.

00:44:44.672 --> 00:44:54.412
So, a Guru cannot belong to any religion because
these religions are also man-made.

00:44:54.412 --> 00:44:59.222
They have created such a problem all over
and they are all fighting among themselves,

00:44:59.222 --> 00:45:01.482
how can they be divine?

00:45:01.482 --> 00:45:12.922
So, you should not get involved into some
sort of a religious bias.

00:45:12.922 --> 00:45:22.972
I've seen it, that a Sahaja Yogi, say if he
is a Christian, then the bias will be shown

00:45:22.972 --> 00:45:23.972
that he is a Christian, you can make it out.

00:45:23.972 --> 00:45:27.712
If he is a Jew, you can make it out.

00:45:27.712 --> 00:45:34.092
So what's the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga?

00:45:34.092 --> 00:45:42.852
Their attention, if it goes inside they'll
find out.

00:45:42.852 --> 00:45:49.962
You have to dissect yourself to see what's
wrong with you and why is it that you are

00:45:49.962 --> 00:45:57.152
not very successful as a Guru.

00:45:57.152 --> 00:46:07.792
The success of the Guru is: he doesn't bother
about time.

00:46:07.792 --> 00:46:11.382
Every time is the holy time.

00:46:11.382 --> 00:46:16.902
For he's not bothered if somebody is late
or has come early.

00:46:16.902 --> 00:46:20.482
He is not a slave of watches and time.

00:46:20.482 --> 00:46:22.962
This is also man-made.

00:46:22.962 --> 00:46:31.132
There were no watches about, I think, three
hundred years back and nobody was so particular

00:46:31.132 --> 00:46:32.622
about the timing.

00:46:32.622 --> 00:46:39.812
So, first thing, he is beyond time, kalatit
as they call it.

00:46:39.812 --> 00:46:42.912
Then he is also gunatit.

00:46:42.912 --> 00:46:50.812
Gunatit means he doesn't belong to the left
side or to the right side or to the center.

00:46:50.812 --> 00:47:00.982
He is beyond these three, beyond these gunas
where he stands and sees everything in the

00:47:00.982 --> 00:47:03.602
Divine Light.

00:47:03.602 --> 00:47:05.482
Everything!

00:47:05.482 --> 00:47:09.592
If something good happens to him, he said,
"The Divine Light has done."

00:47:09.592 --> 00:47:14.802
If something bad happens to him, he said,
"The Divine light wanted this way."

00:47:14.802 --> 00:47:17.382
Everything he leaves for the Divine Light.

00:47:17.382 --> 00:47:19.752
He is beyond the gunas.

00:47:19.752 --> 00:47:26.552
Like, supposing there is a person who is on
the right side - egoistical - then he'll start

00:47:26.552 --> 00:47:28.902
saying, "How is it?

00:47:28.902 --> 00:47:33.442
I wanted this, this didn't work out and how...,"
he'll challenge.

00:47:33.442 --> 00:47:39.142
Another will start crying, the left sided
one that "I'm very sorry this has happened

00:47:39.142 --> 00:47:43.072
to me, it should not have happened" and all
that.

00:47:43.072 --> 00:47:50.502
In the center also, he might think that "How
far are my vibrations, how could I not know?"

00:47:50.502 --> 00:47:52.012
and all that.

00:47:52.012 --> 00:48:01.132
But a person who is a real Guru, he looks
at it as a drama, as a, just a witness of

00:48:01.132 --> 00:48:02.132
the drama.

00:48:02.132 --> 00:48:06.282
"It happened, it was to happen, so it has
happened."

00:48:06.282 --> 00:48:09.082
So, what do we get out of it?

00:48:09.082 --> 00:48:16.322
You see we get something: the lesson that
this was not right or this was wrong, that's

00:48:16.322 --> 00:48:17.322
all.

00:48:17.322 --> 00:48:23.752
For that moment, not to go on churning in
your head, that's all one gets and he is not

00:48:23.752 --> 00:48:25.582
bothered about anything else.

00:48:25.582 --> 00:48:34.742
So he goes beyond his gunas, beyond gunas
he lives, he eats anywhere, sleeps anywhere,

00:48:34.742 --> 00:48:41.882
he is not bothered where he lives, he is not
bothered whether he goes by car or he goes

00:48:41.882 --> 00:48:50.512
by bullock cart, he doesn't feel he is being
not honored if they give him a garland of

00:48:50.512 --> 00:48:53.822
few flowers.

00:48:53.822 --> 00:48:56.492
It's not that.

00:48:56.492 --> 00:49:04.982
He is not bothered, because nothing can enhance
his personality - nothing!

00:49:04.982 --> 00:49:14.532
You give them something simple it's all right,
or even if you don't give, it's all right.

00:49:14.532 --> 00:49:20.632
It's not he judges himself through your eyes,
but he judges himself through his own eyes

00:49:20.632 --> 00:49:26.912
and he sees for himself the joy of enjoying
himself.

00:49:26.912 --> 00:49:34.272
What is there to be so particular about anything?

00:49:34.272 --> 00:49:40.462
What is so great to be hankering after anything?

00:49:40.462 --> 00:49:47.542
It just works out in its own time and if it
doesn't, it doesn't.

00:49:47.542 --> 00:49:49.002
What does it matter?

00:49:49.002 --> 00:49:51.092
Just think of it!

00:49:51.092 --> 00:49:58.462
Also, in Sahaja Yoga, a Guru has to be a binding
force.

00:49:58.462 --> 00:50:09.392
There are two types of people, I've seen,
which go on breaking relations.

00:50:09.392 --> 00:50:12.542
It's very easy for them.

00:50:12.542 --> 00:50:15.392
They go on complaining.

00:50:15.392 --> 00:50:25.082
But there are others who have a power to bind
people together in such a manner, in such

00:50:25.082 --> 00:50:33.102
a sweet manner that the people are brought
closer together.

00:50:33.102 --> 00:50:39.132
Not that they have to forgive, it automatically
it works out.

00:50:39.132 --> 00:50:45.622
Just works out like that and people go on
joining such a man.

00:50:45.622 --> 00:50:50.602
I was surprised that in America they were
very, very few Sahaja Yogis.

00:50:50.602 --> 00:50:59.852
"We spend," they said, "Fifty thousand dollars
and got fifty Sahaja Yogis."

00:50:59.852 --> 00:51:04.402
One thousand for one Sahaja Yogi in America!

00:51:04.402 --> 00:51:13.442
So, very bad shape, but still, you see we
have to hope for them, because there are lots

00:51:13.442 --> 00:51:17.802
of seekers and lost in the wilderness of seeking.

00:51:17.802 --> 00:51:24.272
But I thought that maybe it's a circle.

00:51:24.272 --> 00:51:30.772
They have to pass through this circle of stupidity
and then definitely they will see the point

00:51:30.772 --> 00:51:33.342
and it has happened.

00:51:33.342 --> 00:51:41.872
We had about four thousand people for My lecture
which never has happened there in that country.

00:51:41.872 --> 00:51:47.612
"Nobody has got such a lot of audience," they
said.

00:51:47.612 --> 00:51:54.492
But still, not many came but they got their
Realization.

00:51:54.492 --> 00:51:58.932
So, I think gradually, even in America it
may start growing.

00:51:58.932 --> 00:52:07.722
And the Sahaja Yogis must not only worry about
their houses and where they live and all that,

00:52:07.722 --> 00:52:11.752
but go all out to them.

00:52:11.752 --> 00:52:17.452
I would say some of the Sahaja Yogis who could
afford to go, should go to America and work

00:52:17.452 --> 00:52:21.132
out this outside work.

00:52:21.132 --> 00:52:28.662
May be if there are outsiders who come and
talk about Sahaja Yoga, they might be impressed.

00:52:28.662 --> 00:52:36.442
There are so many false gurus that you can't
count them.

00:52:36.442 --> 00:52:38.162
And they have accepted them.

00:52:38.162 --> 00:52:43.542
It's very surprising, though they have suffered,
they have lost in money, everything, still

00:52:43.542 --> 00:52:47.302
they have accepted, "After all he is our guru!"

00:52:47.302 --> 00:52:52.502
So, there is basically something wrong with
their brains that they don't understand what

00:52:52.502 --> 00:52:56.762
is to be expected.

00:52:56.762 --> 00:52:58.092
I have written one book.

00:52:58.092 --> 00:53:04.432
Perhaps it may reach them, but in any case
you all can write your experiences and things

00:53:04.432 --> 00:53:05.852
and can publish it.

00:53:05.852 --> 00:53:08.742
Maybe it might help them to open their eyes.

00:53:08.742 --> 00:53:15.972
While writing anything, you have to remember
that it should show your quality of Sahaja

00:53:15.972 --> 00:53:19.632
Yoga, how you are.

00:53:19.632 --> 00:53:33.302
In that, one should not feel that you are
putting them down or trying to say some things

00:53:33.302 --> 00:53:40.562
which will hurt them, but say it in such a
manner that it corrects them and helps them.

00:53:40.562 --> 00:53:50.542
For a Guru, it is important that he should
not have any false ideas about himself.

00:53:50.542 --> 00:53:56.232
He might be from a poor family, might be from
the rich family.

00:53:56.232 --> 00:53:59.672
Whatever it is, he should not be conscious
of that.

00:53:59.672 --> 00:54:06.652
Because, once you become that ... See, look
at Kabira, he was just a weaver, look at Tridas,

00:54:06.652 --> 00:54:11.462
he was just a... what you call that?

00:54:11.462 --> 00:54:12.692
Shoemaker.

00:54:12.692 --> 00:54:21.092
See, in India these are very low castes, supposed
to be.

00:54:21.092 --> 00:54:23.572
He has written beautiful poetry.

00:54:23.572 --> 00:54:29.362
Then Namadeva, he was a tailor, just think
of that.

00:54:29.362 --> 00:54:37.322
All these people have written the same thing
with such great beauty of poetry.

00:54:37.322 --> 00:54:39.252
How have they achieved?

00:54:39.252 --> 00:54:45.002
Because, now they have entered into that great
realm of spirituality.

00:54:45.002 --> 00:54:50.472
You people also write some very good poetry,
I know.

00:54:50.472 --> 00:54:56.632
But some of the people who have written good
poetry turned out to be very obstinate, very

00:54:56.632 --> 00:54:57.632
egoistical people.

00:54:57.632 --> 00:55:00.332
This is something I couldn't understand.

00:55:00.332 --> 00:55:05.202
You are writing here a beautiful poetry and
here you are full of ego.

00:55:05.202 --> 00:55:10.622
So, from where this poetry is coming, God
knows.

00:55:10.622 --> 00:55:18.922
So, first of all is yourself, your personality
has to be something that people should say,

00:55:18.922 --> 00:55:24.192
"This is the real Guru we have met."

00:55:24.192 --> 00:55:34.552
For that, you know very well, you don't have
to give up your family, don't have to give

00:55:34.552 --> 00:55:35.682
up anything.

00:55:35.682 --> 00:55:46.902
But ego, if it is still there, I don't know
what to say, but you must get rid of it completely

00:55:46.902 --> 00:55:51.862
and collectively also, ego should be driven
out, collectively.

00:55:51.862 --> 00:55:59.052
It's a thing that, people are egoistical secretly
within themselves but sometimes it shows,

00:55:59.052 --> 00:56:07.902
it's a very subtle nonsensical disease that
people have and they just indulge into it.

00:56:07.902 --> 00:56:18.262
On this day of Guru Puja, I have to say now
that one has to work very hard, very hard.

00:56:18.262 --> 00:56:28.372
The most important thing is how much you have
dedicated your life, your time to Sahaja Yoga.

00:56:28.372 --> 00:56:31.232
Then only you will achieve that state of Guru.

00:56:31.232 --> 00:56:41.632
Look at Me, I'm a house wife and I have my
family's responsibilities, problems, but despite

00:56:41.632 --> 00:56:51.832
that, I'm all the time thinking about Sahaja
Yogis, Sahaja Yoga and all that is this emancipation

00:56:51.832 --> 00:56:56.912
of human beings in the whole world.

00:56:56.912 --> 00:57:02.102
Not only here or there, in the whole world.

00:57:02.102 --> 00:57:10.282
So, that should be your widened vision, not
for only your school, college, or university,

00:57:10.282 --> 00:57:18.172
your this or that but a very wider vision
one should have and that you have to develop

00:57:18.172 --> 00:57:29.922
through your working into every type of circumstances,
every type of problems you have.

00:57:29.922 --> 00:57:37.322
Once you develop that kind of a personality,
then you'll be amazed how you can help so

00:57:37.322 --> 00:57:38.322
many people.

00:57:38.322 --> 00:57:42.402
I know there are so many Sahaja Yogis here
who are worthy of praise and really I love

00:57:42.402 --> 00:57:55.192
them very much and they also love Me very
much, but one should always see that, as you

00:57:55.192 --> 00:58:04.692
are now going to be the Gurus, you have to
be careful not to think that you are a Guru.

00:58:04.692 --> 00:58:08.292
You should never think you are a guru already.

00:58:08.292 --> 00:58:14.532
Once you start thinking again Mr. Ego, the
guru, comes up.

00:58:14.532 --> 00:58:22.492
So, once you decide that "I'm nothing, I'm
nothing, I'm just a little ripple in the heart

00:58:22.492 --> 00:58:23.802
of my Mother."

00:58:23.802 --> 00:58:31.642
If such a humble feeling you get, then, all
your problems can be solved and things will

00:58:31.642 --> 00:58:32.642
work out.

00:58:32.642 --> 00:58:38.992
Because your attention and your behavior is
going to impress other people, nothing else.

00:58:38.992 --> 00:58:50.122
Whatever you may try, it is you who is going
to get Sahaja Yoga further.

00:58:50.122 --> 00:58:57.312
There is so much to be said about how to become
a good Guru and all that but I think I'll

00:58:57.312 --> 00:58:59.172
keep it for next Guru Puja.

00:58:59.172 --> 00:59:00.062
Thank you very much.
