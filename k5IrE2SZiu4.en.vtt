01:54.634 --> 02:00.695
I bow to all those who have found the truth

02:01.346 --> 02:06.901
and those who are still trying to find.

02:09.758 --> 02:14.370
The greatest problem of human beings is,

02:14.799 --> 02:19.020
surprising, that they don’t know themselves.

02:19.524 --> 02:22.448
They don’t know what powers they have.

02:22.726 --> 02:26.134
They don’t know what properties they have.

02:26.308 --> 02:29.560
They don’t know to what height they can rise.

02:30.234 --> 02:35.532
This is the main problem of ignorance about yourself.

02:36.223 --> 02:40.303
If you could just peep in your heart

02:40.454 --> 02:45.469
and start thinking about the spiritual life

02:45.623 --> 02:51.427
that you could have, you would know you are a treasure,

02:51.634 --> 02:56.340
treasure of powers of love,

02:56.590 --> 03:02.490
powers of justice and powers of wisdom.

03:03.038 --> 03:09.968
The problem is we have no idea as to what we are

03:10.953 --> 03:14.529
and Sahaja Yogis also, they are so humble

03:14.680 --> 03:18.557
that they do not realize what powers they have,

03:18.676 --> 03:23.665
and sometimes I find they are little shy
to talk about Sahaja Yoga

03:23.898 --> 03:30.216
or to tell about others because they think
it might be their ego that is bigger.

03:31.245 --> 03:37.666
Now, I have to tell you one thing that ego will always deflate,

03:38.095 --> 03:43.015
it will always deflate when you will face the society.

03:44.087 --> 03:46.341
Unless and until you face others

03:46.468 --> 03:50.177
your ego cannot come down. Now, how?

03:50.447 --> 03:57.917
The ego is there because when you think
that others are better than you,

03:58.632 --> 04:04.050
when you are afraid to say that they have to transform,

04:04.716 --> 04:11.281
and when you are worried that you are being very aggressive.

04:11.904 --> 04:18.041
If you are a Sahaja Yogi and if you are meditating everyday,

04:18.201 --> 04:20.886
you are cleansing yourself.

04:21.428 --> 04:28.839
You have a power within yourself
which will show its results.

04:28.973 --> 04:35.410
It will show its powers and manifestation in such a big way

04:35.601 --> 04:43.582
that you start surprising at yourself – “Is it what I am?”

04:44.613 --> 04:47.984
With the Kundalini awakening what happens

04:48.207 --> 04:54.062
that all this petty things as we call in Sanskrit “Shadripus”,

04:55.083 --> 04:57.878
they all drop out.

04:58.331 --> 05:01.198
But we must face ourselves.

05:02.021 --> 05:04.892
Some people in Sahaja Yoga thinks

05:05.225 --> 05:09.183
that we can become a very great people

05:09.232 --> 05:12.948
or we’d achieve some great positions and all that.

05:13.178 --> 05:16.232
That’s not the point. It’s not outside.

05:16.541 --> 05:19.126
It’s not the outside ambition,

05:19.277 --> 05:24.784
but the inner light which has to shine through you.

05:25.527 --> 05:29.550
All of you are quite intelligent

05:29.725 --> 05:33.542
and are experts, I should say,

05:33.645 --> 05:37.270
as far as the chakra knowledge is concerned.

05:37.499 --> 05:40.949
But what about the knowledge of yourself?

05:41.328 --> 05:44.087
Do you know about yourself

05:44.420 --> 05:48.095
what you can do, what you are capable of?

05:48.357 --> 05:51.430
That’s the point where we are missing.

05:51.517 --> 05:54.399
All right, it is the urge within

05:54.519 --> 05:57.725
because you have got your self-realization.

05:58.143 --> 06:05.118
But you still lack in one thing is a complete confidence in yourself,

06:05.404 --> 06:07.965
that you know the truth.

06:08.720 --> 06:13.947
And, as the people who know the truth what you have to do

06:14.073 --> 06:17.831
is to spread the truth to make

06:17.863 --> 06:23.914
this darkness of ignorance pass away.

06:24.113 --> 06:27.721
But in Sahaja Yoga also I have seen people when they come

06:27.911 --> 06:33.049
they start getting ideas about themselves and trying to organize things.

06:33.049 --> 06:35.631
They do all kinds of things.
I know that.

06:36.382 --> 06:41.959
Instead of that, if you get full picture about yourself –

06:42.094 --> 06:46.755
what you are capable of and what you can achieve

06:46.985 --> 06:50.437
by giving realizations to others,

06:50.596 --> 06:54.350
by making them understand what are

06:54.528 --> 06:58.787
their powers are, not yours, their powers are.

06:59.319 --> 07:00.992
What they can achieve.

07:01.202 --> 07:06.227
I tell you, we can go very fast with the spreading of Sahaja Yoga.

07:06.864 --> 07:10.989
But this fear that we may develop ego,

07:11.140 --> 07:14.789
there are many who have this kind of a nonsensical idea.

07:15.068 --> 07:17.166
You cannot.

07:17.390 --> 07:22.047
Because the more you will meditate,
the more you will face yourself,

07:22.258 --> 07:28.191
you will know that you have so many great things within you

07:28.335 --> 07:34.301
just like a storehouse of jewels.

07:35.137 --> 07:38.057
You must respect yourself

07:38.343 --> 07:42.510
and you must know within yourself what you have got.

07:42.622 --> 07:45.547
Not what you want to achieve outside.

07:45.750 --> 07:50.393
Like, there are some who trying to be, say, leaders, this, that …

07:50.526 --> 07:55.206
That’s all nonsense. That’s of no worth.

07:55.395 --> 08:00.962
The best thing is to know that you are a treasure

08:01.320 --> 08:04.494
of great value system within you

08:04.668 --> 08:07.877
and you can awaken that. You have powers.

08:08.007 --> 08:12.393
You can do that very easily without hurting anyone,

08:12.559 --> 08:17.323
without troubling anybody,
without taking any money, all kinds of things.

08:18.719 --> 08:22.051
But as it is I find,

08:22.401 --> 08:25.497
the people are either money oriented

08:25.632 --> 08:29.560
or power oriented outside.

08:30.487 --> 08:31.596
Not inside.

08:31.748 --> 08:36.222
Inside is the wealth; inside is the power;

08:36.405 --> 08:40.675
inside everything that you can think of.

08:41.069 --> 08:45.990
There are people I know who never used to
come on the stage to speak even.

08:46.776 --> 08:49.646
Now, they have become great speakers.

08:49.852 --> 08:54.302
And, I am amazed to see how they have been transformed.

08:54.503 --> 09:00.191
The greatest transformation is that you know yourself fully well

09:00.310 --> 09:03.956
and that with that knowledge you change others.

09:04.137 --> 09:07.538
Don’t keep yourself limited to yourself.

09:07.686 --> 09:10.365
You have to spread out.

09:10.484 --> 09:13.078
This power has been given to you

09:13.259 --> 09:16.927
to know yourself fully, and to be confident

09:17.222 --> 09:19.680
and to be kind and gentle

09:19.887 --> 09:23.198
and talk to people in that way that they know

09:23.365 --> 09:26.531
that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

09:28.655 --> 09:34.202
It is not given to you just to say that you are Sahaja Yogis

09:34.313 --> 09:37.178
but to know yourself fully,

09:37.280 --> 09:42.526
to peep into your own treasures, into your understanding.

09:42.803 --> 09:47.364
Now, I must say, there are so many people in this world,
millions and millions.

09:47.601 --> 09:50.552
Why you people have come to Sahaja Yoga?

09:50.978 --> 09:53.640
I didn’t choose you. You chose Me.

09:53.931 --> 09:58.140
And, when you have chosen Me, you must know within yourself

09:58.283 --> 10:01.148
that “there must be something in me

10:01.399 --> 10:04.178
that has made me come to Sahaja Yoga

10:04.345 --> 10:06.853
and to understand the subtle system."

10:07.052 --> 10:08.850
It’s a very subtle system

10:09.043 --> 10:12.644
and it can be known only to very subtle people

10:12.747 --> 10:15.015
and not to gross people.

10:15.304 --> 10:20.942
But if you yourself discover yourself

10:21.172 --> 10:25.386
and then you go ahead, there cannot be any ego

10:25.557 --> 10:27.440
because you are not ego.

10:27.978 --> 10:30.532
Those who have ego, as I told you,

10:30.669 --> 10:34.185
they even make money out of Sahaja Yoga, they even try

10:34.354 --> 10:40.357
to organize things something to promote them.

10:40.738 --> 10:43.251
They are on a very different level.

10:43.466 --> 10:48.396
But if you are not that kind then you should not become just stationary.

10:48.499 --> 10:52.179
You should do what it is to find out – What am I?

10:52.972 --> 10:54.386
What am I?

10:54.659 --> 10:56.891
Christ has said, “Know Thyself."

10:57.042 --> 10:59.640
Mohammed Sahib has said, “Know Thyself."

10:59.749 --> 11:03.049
All of them have said, “Know Thyself."

11:03.280 --> 11:06.110
That means you are something great.

11:06.213 --> 11:11.454
You have a hidden properties within you which you do not know.

11:11.639 --> 11:15.332
Once you know yourself you will have self respect,

11:15.459 --> 11:19.381
you will not do wrong things, you will have no anger.

11:19.460 --> 11:22.107
But you will be an ocean of love.

11:22.949 --> 11:24.691
That’s what it has to be.

11:24.786 --> 11:26.717
That is what Sahaja Yoga is.

11:26.810 --> 11:30.132
I understand that these are the worst days,

11:30.219 --> 11:33.533
it’s the “Aghor Kaliyuga” as people say. All right.

11:33.708 --> 11:37.855
But why are you here during this time?

11:38.338 --> 11:40.754
To enlighten people.

11:40.965 --> 11:43.521
To give them the right ideas.

11:43.668 --> 11:47.571
But how unless and until you do not know yourself fully

11:47.706 --> 11:50.926
that you are capable of this and you are capable of that.

11:51.152 --> 11:56.732
You see, the life of all great men, I would say, people like Abraham Lincoln.

11:57.533 --> 12:03.502
He realized in very young age that he has to

12:04.201 --> 12:08.140
assert on others his own value system

12:08.235 --> 12:11.095
by showing his own example.

12:12.375 --> 12:16.899
Though it was very hard for people to understand him,

12:17.092 --> 12:21.410
still he has shown such results.

12:21.655 --> 12:24.526
I have read many lives of this kind.

12:24.803 --> 12:27.512
Like, in Turkey, we had Ataturk.

12:27.637 --> 12:30.017
We had everywhere one person like that.

12:30.231 --> 12:33.146
In India, we had Lal Bahadur Shastri

12:33.290 --> 12:37.673
who was such a great man and who knew about Sahaja Yoga,

12:37.808 --> 12:40.039
who used to respect Me so much.

12:40.152 --> 12:42.824
People would wonder why should he respect Me

12:42.959 --> 12:45.673
more than he would respect My husband or anyone,

12:45.925 --> 12:48.722
because he realized what I was.

12:48.905 --> 12:52.285
But he was not, he didn’t get the chance.

12:52.444 --> 12:54.342
Now, you people have a chance.

12:54.527 --> 12:57.487
All right, I am quite old now.

12:57.668 --> 13:01.080
It’s correct. But still I am not going to give up.

13:01.397 --> 13:04.571
Till I live I’ll work very hard

13:04.738 --> 13:08.301
to convince you about your own,

13:09.134 --> 13:13.839
your own personality, your own self.

13:13.990 --> 13:16.570
That’s what I am living for.

13:16.740 --> 13:19.638
Till you are completely convinced.

13:19.769 --> 13:23.373
You will be amazed that people who come to Sahaja Yoga

13:23.453 --> 13:27.280
also do all kinds of nonsensical things.
I know they do.

13:27.610 --> 13:29.815
But they are not Sahaja Yogis in a way.

13:29.918 --> 13:33.383
Because unless and until you go deep into yourself,

13:33.756 --> 13:39.195
unless and until you find out what is your personality

13:39.449 --> 13:41.727
in the real sense of the word,

13:42.077 --> 13:48.839
whatever you may try, whatever you may do, it is not Sahaja.

13:49.307 --> 13:51.409
Sahaja means spontaneous.

13:51.491 --> 13:54.057
It comes spontaneously to you.

13:54.358 --> 13:58.634
As it is we know, in Sahaja Yoga you get connected

13:58.761 --> 14:02.784
to that area which Einstein has called as torsion area.

14:03.054 --> 14:07.394
But that torsion area is there behind you,

14:07.473 --> 14:10.958
Paramachaitnya is there to support you, to help you.

14:11.068 --> 14:14.372
All of you have got this, but despite that

14:14.499 --> 14:18.825
you don’t believe it, believe into it, believe in yourself.

14:19.007 --> 14:22.003
You have that power within you.

14:22.291 --> 14:25.672
I know of one fellow who was in Bombay.

14:25.914 --> 14:29.663
He was a fisherman and a great Sahaja Yogi.

14:29.695 --> 14:31.990
I should we have lost him.

14:32.586 --> 14:37.593
So, one day he was going to another island

14:38.022 --> 14:42.299
for spreading Sahaja Yoga among fishermen.

14:42.851 --> 14:49.626
And, he found in the sky such black clouds threatening.

14:50.430 --> 14:53.070
So he came out and he threatened them,

14:53.213 --> 14:56.715
“I am going for my Mother’s work.

14:56.949 --> 15:00.655
How dare you bring the rain?

15:00.820 --> 15:04.962
You should not rain, bring the rain till I come back."

15:05.336 --> 15:07.185
And, it was surprising.

15:07.322 --> 15:12.380
He went down, did all his jobs everything,
came back after five hours.

15:12.531 --> 15:15.861
And, when he went to bed it started thundering.

15:16.171 --> 15:21.886
The nature will be with you, because nature is our representative.

15:22.275 --> 15:23.642
It helps us.

15:23.822 --> 15:28.122
If you are of that quality, nature will stand by you.

15:28.304 --> 15:32.405
You have seen that many a times, nature has helped Me.

15:32.738 --> 15:36.973
It is not because I have any control over them, I tell them anything,

15:37.097 --> 15:44.089
but only thing they realize that I am here for such an such work.

15:44.332 --> 15:47.139
And that I am to be supported.

15:47.448 --> 15:52.155
In the same way, if you can establish it the nature will know

15:52.353 --> 15:56.779
that you are the people who are here to

15:57.009 --> 16:01.410
redeem the whole universe. You can do it.

16:01.437 --> 16:05.683
I may think that the whole world should be redeemed and all that.

16:05.786 --> 16:07.070
But, how can I do it?

16:07.070 --> 16:09.669
If I could have done it, I would not have anything.

16:09.764 --> 16:11.296
I have to have channels.

16:11.399 --> 16:14.539
And, these channels who know their job,

16:14.595 --> 16:19.609
they know themselves, those who are quite capable of doing it.

16:20.323 --> 16:22.404
You are special people no doubt.

16:22.476 --> 16:24.736
Otherwise why are you here?

16:24.799 --> 16:34.281
But that specialty is this
that you are a good conductor of this Divine energy.

16:34.471 --> 16:36.640
You are a wonderful conductor.

16:36.835 --> 16:38.436
You are an expert on that.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.279
It just works.

16:40.486 --> 16:47.380
It works automatically
but your connection with the Divine should be absolute.

16:47.785 --> 16:51.403
Now, talking about absolute values is correct.

16:51.565 --> 16:56.239
But these absolute values, do they exist within us or not?

16:56.454 --> 17:01.079
If they do, then why not we make others imbibe them?

17:01.214 --> 17:04.272
It’s not difficult.
It’s not at all difficult I tell you.

17:04.483 --> 17:07.019
I am just an ordinary housewife.

17:08.019 --> 17:10.779
What? It’s just My love.

17:10.984 --> 17:15.119
Just My, I should say, My nature itself

17:15.825 --> 17:20.149
that it has worked. I was sure about Myself.

17:20.372 --> 17:24.301
Though outside I may look a very humble housewife.

17:24.385 --> 17:27.716
People used to think I don’t speak much because I don’t know English.

17:27.883 --> 17:31.540
This was the situation. But that’s not the point.

17:31.637 --> 17:35.401
The point is, I knew what I was.

17:35.554 --> 17:40.093
I knew what I am, and I knew what I have to be.

17:40.339 --> 17:42.628
That’s all. That’s the only difference.

17:42.841 --> 17:49.461
If you people develop that knowledge within yourself,
you can be dynamic.

17:49.596 --> 17:54.111
You will not have ambitions, you will not have some desires,

17:54.238 --> 17:58.996
you will not have anger, you will not have greed.

17:59.171 --> 18:01.787
All these drop out like that.

18:02.126 --> 18:07.006
First of all, we have to know what is our basis.

18:07.271 --> 18:14.027
And the most important basis is that we are born in a particular country.

18:15.061 --> 18:18.241
And we should get concerned about that.

18:18.409 --> 18:21.839
They say that I was a revolutionary and all that I did.

18:21.872 --> 18:24.168
I went to jail, everything I did.

18:24.276 --> 18:30.205
But that was just to get My country, country’s independence.

18:30.427 --> 18:31.763
That was different.

18:31.941 --> 18:35.109
But after that independence what should have happened

18:35.188 --> 18:39.667
is to make people realize what they are.

18:40.444 --> 18:44.436
Not only India, it’s in every country one has to understand

18:44.507 --> 18:47.460
what is the need of that country.

18:47.642 --> 18:55.993
What they have to do to improve, to help, to rise, to transform.

18:56.333 --> 19:01.149
You should not, I never asked you that you change your names

19:01.213 --> 19:05.139
or anything though you ask for Indian names. All right.

19:05.274 --> 19:11.160
But what is My main concern is that you should have concern for your countrymen.

19:11.661 --> 19:13.692
You are so empowered.

19:13.978 --> 19:18.970
Your kundalini has reached that state where you can do a lot.

19:19.043 --> 19:23.269
I know some of you have done a lot and have worked out.

19:23.449 --> 19:26.803
But still all of you have to do it.

19:26.995 --> 19:31.953
I would just say, the seven…seventy-eighth birthday, I forget also,

19:32.041 --> 19:36.386
seventy-eighth birthday. I am just the same.

19:36.529 --> 19:39.964
I have not changed much because within Myself

19:40.035 --> 19:45.281
I feel that I have to tell people what they are.

19:45.710 --> 19:48.756
I have to tell them what they can achieve.

19:48.923 --> 19:54.821
And, I have to move in such a manner that they see it,

19:55.131 --> 20:02.047
that nothing is important than to know what you are.

20:02.246 --> 20:05.218
You are rich, poor – doesn’t matter.

20:05.549 --> 20:07.052
Nothing matters.

20:07.189 --> 20:10.099
What is important is to know yourself.

20:10.330 --> 20:14.245
I’m surprised very little has been written

20:14.381 --> 20:17.745
so far, but I find Tao by Lao Tse.

20:17.951 --> 20:20.482
I don’t know if you have read the book of Lao Tse,

20:20.713 --> 20:25.528
about Tao and meaning that what you are.

20:25.885 --> 20:29.255
Tao means what you are, and he describes

20:29.446 --> 20:34.906
very nicely that when you are that what happens.

20:35.112 --> 20:38.509
Now, the gap was how to achieve that state,

20:38.613 --> 20:42.305
how to reach that state was not given. He only described

20:42.369 --> 20:46.756
people who were Tao, who were realized souls,

20:46.859 --> 20:49.922
who were of what level [UNCLEAR] and

20:50.010 --> 20:53.692
I was surprised that he never said about kundalini,

20:53.922 --> 20:56.535
but he talked about the river, Yangtse.

20:56.651 --> 21:00.920
That it is Yangtse river, you see in a symbolic way, he was more poetic.

21:01.160 --> 21:05.725
But ultimately reaching the ocean, that river becomes the ocean

21:06.353 --> 21:09.309
and then what are the qualities of the ocean

21:09.372 --> 21:11.529
he described so beautifully.

21:12.028 --> 21:16.397
Now, I would say you all have become supposing the ocean.

21:16.619 --> 21:19.140
So, are you behaving like the ocean?

21:20.089 --> 21:24.240
Are you understanding your capacity to be an ocean?

21:24.311 --> 21:27.760
What is an ocean is: look at the ocean,

21:27.950 --> 21:32.390
it has its own boundaries, maryadas, it doesn’t cross.

21:32.501 --> 21:36.028
If you try to push it one side, it will come outside.

21:36.232 --> 21:40.177
So you are, you have to be in your marayadas.

21:40.197 --> 21:43.193
We can call it also in your balance. That’s very important

21:43.578 --> 21:45.840
that you should be in your balance.

21:45.993 --> 21:49.385
Now many people say who have given up smoking

21:49.528 --> 21:54.436
have again started smoking,
who have given up drinking again have started drinking.

21:54.547 --> 21:57.097
That means you have lost your maryadas.

21:57.247 --> 22:01.487
So those maryadas must be watched, watched yourself.

22:01.630 --> 22:04.836
If you go on watching yourself you will know what you are.

22:05.261 --> 22:07.122
You must watch yourself.

22:07.240 --> 22:09.070
You call him, “Hello Mister.

22:09.070 --> 22:11.010
So now, what are you up to?”

22:11.119 --> 22:14.305
Then you will see how your mind is working.

22:14.777 --> 22:18.353
With that thing what happens that this ocean,

22:18.568 --> 22:23.149
which is the love of Divinity, just starts flowing.

22:24.324 --> 22:26.791
Now this ocean, perhaps you don’t know,

22:26.990 --> 22:30.188
that ocean is the lowest thing.

22:30.544 --> 22:34.576
We measure all the heights from the ocean.

22:34.742 --> 22:38.149
If the ocean is at a zero point, what is the height of Himalaya?

22:38.531 --> 22:41.320
So, it keeps at the lowest.

22:41.560 --> 22:45.626
Because being the lowest it receives all the waters,

22:45.745 --> 22:50.243
all the things that are coming from the rivers or from the rain.

22:50.600 --> 22:55.222
Then, it burns its body in the sun – it’s open.

22:55.802 --> 22:58.956
And, when it burns it creates those clouds.

22:59.178 --> 23:05.189
And, the whole circle is created that
these clouds can go and shower rain on people

23:05.456 --> 23:09.127
and again they become rivers and they come back to the sea.

23:09.292 --> 23:13.130
Everything has to go to the sea because it is the lowest.

23:13.400 --> 23:18.390
So, you stand at the lowest point with your confidence.

23:19.535 --> 23:21.124
At the lowest point.

23:21.323 --> 23:25.224
Don’t compare yourself with another person who is

23:25.312 --> 23:28.252
who is doing very well in life or may be something.

23:28.316 --> 23:30.866
But see that you are the lowest.

23:30.953 --> 23:36.101
At the lowest point you stand and you will be amazed

23:36.236 --> 23:39.237
that everything will come to you.

23:40.076 --> 23:43.616
Everything you will see that it flows into you.

23:43.815 --> 23:48.487
Main thing is knowing thyself itself it means

23:48.598 --> 23:52.201
that you know that you are the highest.

23:53.495 --> 23:55.280
You are the highest.

23:55.328 --> 23:59.975
But you are highest because you stand at the lowest point.

24:00.404 --> 24:04.216
It’s true that I have tremendous love for the poor people.

24:04.256 --> 24:08.901
It’s true also that I have been really
very much yearning to do something for that

24:08.951 --> 24:14.328
and that’s how we have started
at least sixteen projects in India.

24:15.006 --> 24:21.933
Now, all that is done just because I cannot contain Myself.

24:21.958 --> 24:25.386
All this kind of miseries and troubles they have.

24:25.539 --> 24:27.949
Like Orissa, I prayed so much.

24:28.418 --> 24:30.988
Because it’s a country very much troubled.

24:31.152 --> 24:33.959
We should find out why it is so much troubled.

24:34.185 --> 24:35.812
What is the problem there?

24:36.098 --> 24:39.873
And, I tell you, it is a very great country, Orissa is.

24:39.921 --> 24:48.448
I visited it also and main thing missing
there is that still have no confidence.

24:50.711 --> 24:55.120
If they develop Sahaja Yoga within themselves,

24:55.604 --> 25:01.577
no flex can come, no problems can come to that country.

25:02.179 --> 25:07.659
Same in our country, same in your country
and everybody’s country.

25:07.881 --> 25:12.709
First of all, we must have much more Sahaja Yogis,

25:12.836 --> 25:17.196
and we must have Sahaja Yogis
who know they are Sahaja Yogis.

25:18.109 --> 25:24.532
To be very much confident of the fact
that after all you are Sahaja Yogis.

25:24.927 --> 25:26.048
And why not?

25:26.173 --> 25:29.154
Whatever I can do, you all can do it also. Why not?

25:29.531 --> 25:32.023
You are My children. You can do it.

25:32.172 --> 25:36.052
But the confidence should be there that as

25:36.275 --> 25:41.731
Mother is we could be the same without any ego coming in,

25:41.874 --> 25:45.570
because mostly I have seen people very afraid of their ego.

25:45.785 --> 25:49.464
There is no ego in it because you are like the ocean, I said,

25:49.591 --> 25:52.377
which stands at the lowest point.

25:53.099 --> 25:55.079
In the same way, it works out.

25:55.270 --> 25:57.876
It’s so beautiful to love the whole world.

25:58.004 --> 26:03.158
It’s so beautiful to enjoy your compassion, to enjoy your generosity.

26:03.483 --> 26:06.522
I enjoy My generosity much more than anything else.

26:06.649 --> 26:11.421
But in that generosity, I know that I am not doing anything.

26:11.605 --> 26:16.228
It’s just expression of My sense of joy.

26:16.474 --> 26:19.326
You see, I see flowers, I am very happy.

26:19.492 --> 26:24.307
In the same way, I give something to someone, I feel very joyous.

26:24.440 --> 26:28.020
It’s a joy, joy giving quality.

26:28.303 --> 26:31.556
And, all joy giving qualities are within you

26:31.731 --> 26:36.693
which you should discover.
You have got also peace giving qualities.

26:36.910 --> 26:40.873
Such a lot of peace is within you which you can transmit

26:41.069 --> 26:44.521
to the atmosphere, to the people, to everyone

26:44.609 --> 26:47.378
in case your peace is established.

26:48.269 --> 26:54.283
If there is anger, temper, this, that, it won’t work out.

26:55.025 --> 27:00.860
So, you should watch yourself, you should see yourself, you should meditate

27:01.004 --> 27:05.094
and findout what is lacking.

27:05.490 --> 27:11.569
It is such a tremendous force I think sitting before Me.

27:13.638 --> 27:17.793
They can explode all the myths of the world.

27:17.938 --> 27:19.404
I know that.

27:19.773 --> 27:24.975
But I don’t know how to ignite, what to do, how to tell them.

27:25.181 --> 27:28.575
So, now I would again and again tell you one thing,

27:28.726 --> 27:33.229
that on this birthday if you really want to give Me something

27:33.419 --> 27:38.035
then give Me this, that you show your confidence

27:38.210 --> 27:40.644
and you work it out wherever you are.

27:40.832 --> 27:42.573
You don’t have to change atmosphere.

27:42.691 --> 27:44.294
You don’t have to change anything.

27:44.438 --> 27:48.754
Wherever you are with honesty, with sincerity

27:48.834 --> 27:54.734
and with humble nature you can really do a lot.

27:55.567 --> 27:59.953
In every country you can do it, and in the whole world you can do it.

28:00.123 --> 28:05.223
This is My greatest desire and I hope,

28:05.366 --> 28:09.712
I am a person who is desireless, you will fulfill this

28:09.823 --> 28:14.558
subtle desire I have that we should transform the world.

28:14.825 --> 28:16.545
May God Bless you.
