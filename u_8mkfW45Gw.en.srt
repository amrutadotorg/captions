1
00:00:01,365 --> 00:00:03,690
My dear seekers,

2
00:00:05,675 --> 00:00:09,111
I’m thankful to Gavin Brown

3
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:14,033
that he has been able to sum up some of the things I’ve said before

4
00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:23,189
and I don’t have to go into all the details of
what I told you last time.

5
00:00:25,377 --> 00:00:28,902
Some of you have come for the first time here. (Tape interrupted).

6
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:43,351
As he said Tantra is the technique.

7
00:00:45,048 --> 00:00:49,083
It’s a technique and Yantra

8
00:00:49,108 --> 00:00:54,810
in Sanskrit language means the mechanism.

9
00:00:55,862 --> 00:00:59,478
So the technique of the mechanism.

10
00:00:59,637 --> 00:01:03,446
Now what is this mechanism we are talking about?

11
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:08,900
Is there any mechanism outside or inside us?

12
00:01:12,512 --> 00:01:19,166
Or is it worked through some subtle method?

13
00:01:20,335 --> 00:01:28,676
All these questions should come to our mind
if you are thinking and if you are true.

14
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:35,212
But I see that in the West

15
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:39,253
people though are very much developed materially,

16
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:46,044
they have sorted out very material questions and problems,

17
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:49,902
they are very well equipped,

18
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:55,333
but as far as spiritual life is concerned,

19
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:59,006
they – they are very naive.

20
00:02:01,994 --> 00:02:09,839
Though they have such a great personality
like Christ to follow about a model form

21
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:14,782
but maybe because of an organized religion

22
00:02:14,986 --> 00:02:19,214
perhaps it was not possible

23
00:02:19,362 --> 00:02:27,717
for people who were seeking truly
to penetrate into it through meditative methods.

24
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:35,490
So this Tantra or the technique

25
00:02:37,894 --> 00:02:42,281
which works out our Self Realization

26
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:47,793
is to be known, to be understood fully

27
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,684
and the Yantra that works out

28
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:56,750
you have already got and thanks go to
Patrick who has made a beautiful sketch of that

29
00:02:56,921 --> 00:03:03,330
Yantra which is within you, is the instrument which is within you.

30
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:07,366
But when we think of an instrument

31
00:03:07,548 --> 00:03:14,111
with our human mind we cannot think of
an instrument which is a living instrument.

32
00:03:14,554 --> 00:03:18,487
It is beyond our conception to understand a living machine.

33
00:03:20,963 --> 00:03:26,257
This one is a living instrument within you.

34
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:33,854
When you see a tree sprouting out of a small little seed,

35
00:03:34,373 --> 00:03:38,557
working out its blossoming one has to know

36
00:03:38,774 --> 00:03:46,111
that there must be some technique of some mechanism

37
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:51,789
that works out this beautiful tree to grow.

38
00:03:52,153 --> 00:03:56,799
And when we evolved from amoeba to this stage

39
00:03:56,947 --> 00:04:02,480
we have to think there must be some mechanism

40
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:09,341
which thinks, understands, organizes, loves,

41
00:04:09,501 --> 00:04:15,702
which has brought about this human stage from that amoeba stage.

42
00:04:17,653 --> 00:04:26,293
In the ancient India – long time – people had lots of time

43
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:34,564
they went into themselves, into their
being through meditative understanding.

44
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,088
‘They’ had a glimpse of this mechanism

45
00:04:39,326 --> 00:04:49,283
and they talked about it and wrote about it
and that’s how this Yantra

46
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:58,427
– the mechanism – and the Tantra – the maneuvering of it,
the technique of it – came into being.

47
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,087
But it was a secret science.

48
00:05:03,394 --> 00:05:12,863
It was a very secret science and
it was kept hidden from general public.

49
00:05:14,088 --> 00:05:19,826
It was used by very few great masters

50
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:25,064
who lived in the jungle, had one or two disciples,

51
00:05:25,212 --> 00:05:34,014
worked on them for years together
and taught them about the technique of Divine.

52
00:05:34,548 --> 00:05:41,272
They had to leave everything, their family, everyone,

53
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:50,004
live with the Guru, lead a complete separate life

54
00:05:50,515 --> 00:05:58,245
and go into a complete transformation
under the guidance of their loving Gurus.

55
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,880
This was in ancient times.

56
00:06:07,507 --> 00:06:11,883
And what did they achieve, and what did they have,

57
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:17,126
 is all written in our scriptures.

58
00:06:17,223 --> 00:06:26,325
What do you expect out of Self Realization
is written in the Bible, in the Koran, in the Torah

59
00:06:26,609 --> 00:06:31,835
and also in all the Indian philosophy.

60
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:44,858
Only people say it that in some of these scriptures

61
00:06:44,983 --> 00:06:51,071
it is written in a very secretive manner,

62
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:57,931
under some words that,
“I will appear before you as tongues of flames.”

63
00:06:58,242 --> 00:07:03,349
Now nobody knows what’s ‘tongues of flames’ is.

64
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:09,097
There are so many sentences which
you can find out now that you go and read

65
00:07:09,223 --> 00:07:15,173
which nobody can explain unless and until
they have had an experience of Kundalini.

66
00:07:15,514 --> 00:07:20,831
This is the Yantra – the mechanism, is the Kundalini,

67
00:07:21,512 --> 00:07:29,615
is a living force within you, It exists,
it is there, is placed for your Realization,

68
00:07:30,137 --> 00:07:40,339
for your jumping into another awareness
which is promised to you through various scriptures,

69
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,273
through various incarnations.

70
00:07:44,716 --> 00:07:52,941
It is within you. Nobody told you lies.
There is nothing but truth written in these books

71
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:05,717
but it was to be guarded. It was to be made into secret
because people would have used it for their purposes.

72
00:08:06,148 --> 00:08:10,433
And they have despite all that.

73
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:15,184
First, I would like to speak about Self Realization

74
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:22,789
because that is blissful and then
answer you about the so-called tantrikas.

75
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:28,213
I have to talk about it though I have told about these things

76
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:33,138
 in the previous lecture because
there are many here that were not here.

77
00:08:35,288 --> 00:08:45,520
I have now shown here all the centers
and all the mechanism that is within us.

78
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:52,268
 We have also given you a picture of that, I have told you
which are the deities sitting on all these different

79
00:08:52,688 --> 00:08:59,479
Chakras as we call the centers which have incarnated on this earth,

80
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:05,702
have built up our being one by one gradually
in different evolutionary processes

81
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:10,860
and how we have become human beings,
this I have told you last time.

82
00:09:11,065 --> 00:09:19,183
This is the Yantra and the mechanism
that is this Yantra – Kundalini –

83
00:09:19,683 --> 00:09:28,705
is a holy mechanism. And this mechanism is specially created

84
00:09:30,562 --> 00:09:38,249
within the being of the One Main , of the One means the Macrocosm

85
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:45,267
and we are the cells – all of us – in that.

86
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:50,510
We were made aware as fishes of the soil, we became reptiles.

87
00:09:50,657 --> 00:10:02,049
We were made aware of the food available at the heights,
we raised our head. Gradually we became human beings.

88
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:09,169
After this state we started thinking of God.

89
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:15,538
We started thinking on something beyond.

90
00:10:15,787 --> 00:10:24,418
Man is the only animal who thinks of God and of searching.

91
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:31,175
 Is the man aware that he has to become something?

92
00:10:31,301 --> 00:10:37,638
Why is he so confused? Why is he under so tension?
What is he searching?

93
00:10:43,155 --> 00:10:50,157
He is searching something of which he has a glimpse

94
00:10:50,668 --> 00:10:59,727
– a glimpse of that Joy he kept with him
and that Joy comes from his Self – Atma – in his heart –

95
00:11:00,203 --> 00:11:03,031
he has not felt.

96
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:07,035
He has not been able to manifest the power of his Self

97
00:11:07,172 --> 00:11:14,734
but there is a mechanism placed within him,
properly built up inside,

98
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,981
all the time present in all the human beings

99
00:11:21,095 --> 00:11:29,666
just like this as it is placed in the One Being.
In His image it is also placed within you.

100
00:11:32,218 --> 00:11:42,921
As I said last time that you are
all built to be just like computers.

101
00:11:44,062 --> 00:11:47,993
Now the job is to put you to the Main’s.

102
00:11:48,311 --> 00:11:54,904
That’s why you are seeking. That’s the only urge you have in life.

103
00:11:55,073 --> 00:12:05,061
All other urges are actually the side issues.
You think you are searching in money, in position is a myth.

104
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:11,896
Those who have money are dissatisfied, those
who have positions are dissatisfied, everybody is dissatisfied.

105
00:12:12,123 --> 00:12:22,378
The satisfaction time only comes to you
when you will reach the real thing which you are searching

106
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:27,639
and the real thing is your Self and nothing else.

107
00:12:28,127 --> 00:12:33,465
All other things are useless because
you are not searching anything else,

108
00:12:33,612 --> 00:12:43,180
you are only searching your Self
and that Self is the reflection of God almighty,

109
00:12:47,988 --> 00:12:49,788
 that is within your heart.

110
00:12:50,131 --> 00:12:55,543
Now the mechanism that is placed
within you is this beautiful thing inside

111
00:12:55,705 --> 00:13:00,215
which is placed inside your spinal chord and not outside

112
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:06,502
except for the last Chakra which is in the red color

113
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:13,622
that is outside in the prostate [the pelvic plexus].

114
00:13:13,974 --> 00:13:20,187
And this is a very, very important Chakra

115
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:27,370
which controls the survival within us

116
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:32,313
– I’m sorry the Pelvic plexus within us.

117
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:37,597
It is very important because it is very sensitive

118
00:13:39,072 --> 00:13:44,072
and also it is very delicate because
it is placed outside the spinal chord.

119
00:13:50,098 --> 00:13:55,630
This mechanism that is placed outside the spinal chord,

120
00:13:57,014 --> 00:14:00,147
down below there, is the most important Chakra

121
00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:09,230
and was created first. When the creation
started this was the first thing that was created

122
00:14:09,372 --> 00:14:14,612
and what does it emit holiness, innocence.

123
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:22,548
It emits innocence. And the deity sitting on this,

124
00:14:24,872 --> 00:14:35,365
 is the embodiment of innocence.
This deity was created in another dimension

125
00:14:37,032 --> 00:14:42,818
and He is – you have seen there – is Shri Ganesha.

126
00:14:43,046 --> 00:14:46,772
This is the image of Shri Ganesha that was created

127
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:53,858
at that stage and what does it represent is
the stage between the animal and the man

128
00:14:54,086 --> 00:14:59,608
and the head is that of the animal showing
that an animal does not have any Ego,

129
00:14:59,711 --> 00:15:06,953
that the man is different from an animal,
that the animal is innocent.

130
00:15:07,249 --> 00:15:10,615
He doesn’t know what is sin, that’s why he is innocent.

131
00:15:10,752 --> 00:15:16,522
Because you know what is sin that’s why ‘you’ are

132
00:15:16,988 --> 00:15:21,783
innocent but you can become the fire of damnation.

133
00:15:22,412 --> 00:15:26,879
He is innocence but [only fire He’s seldom?]. (SM slightly laughs.)

134
00:15:27,002 --> 00:15:35,689
And He incarnates too on this earth.
He incarnated as Jesus Christ, Lord Jesus Christ.

135
00:15:36,778 --> 00:15:43,266
He took His form as Lord Jesus Christ and because He is innocent,

136
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:53,914
He’s made of that essence of divine nature of God

137
00:15:54,283 --> 00:15:59,204
that we call as Paramtattwa, the highest essence of God.

138
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:02,787
And that’s why His body is also made out of that

139
00:16:02,969 --> 00:16:09,069
and that is the reason He could resurrect.

140
00:16:12,448 --> 00:16:18,761
By reading Bible which was written by disciples of Christ

141
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,839
how far can you go to understand Him?

142
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:34,314
Because He was created beyond your thoughts, beyond your mind,

143
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:42,462
in an unlimited Unconscious.

144
00:16:42,655 --> 00:16:51,181
And how can you with your limited mind understand Him or copy Him.

145
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:56,879
It is said that even Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh
cannot reach Him. He is so pure.

146
00:16:57,965 --> 00:17:03,860
He is purity. He is innocence

147
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:10,510
and He exists at that point

148
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:18,734
and it is He at every point, every Chakra
He bestows upon you the blessings of His innocence.

149
00:17:18,882 --> 00:17:23,385
Innocence was the first thing created on this Earth.

150
00:17:23,703 --> 00:17:29,100
Before creating anything else it was innocence already there

151
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:35,442
and He bestows that innocence
by which you get your Self Realization.

152
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:43,096
On the left hand side of this mechanism

153
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:46,371
there are seven stratas.

154
00:17:46,655 --> 00:17:50,326
On the right hand side there are seven stratas,

155
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:56,017
down below there are seven stratas
and on top there are seven stratas.

156
00:17:56,358 --> 00:17:59,425
What are these stratas and what do they build?

157
00:18:00,065 --> 00:18:07,865
The left hand side chakras, the left hand side channel
which is called as Ida channel represents the subconscious,

158
00:18:08,103 --> 00:18:17,747
the subconscious mind within you. You listen to Me through
your conscious mind and put it back into the subconscious mind.

159
00:18:17,884 --> 00:18:21,100
All your experiences go into the subconscious.

160
00:18:21,248 --> 00:18:25,760
That is the limit of your subconscious of present here.

161
00:18:25,908 --> 00:18:33,481
Beyond that gouge is your subconscious of previous lives

162
00:18:33,584 --> 00:18:41,281
and beyond that gouge is the collective subconscious.

163
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:55,973
When you listen to Me you have got a conscious mind which
receives it at this moment and there is a pre-conscious mind

164
00:18:56,166 --> 00:19:04,385
which takes it to the subconscious.
This pre-conscious mind is on the right hand side.

165
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:09,795
This also has got seven stratas on this side.

166
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:15,850
Just now the pre-conscious mind is the future

167
00:19:16,202 --> 00:19:20,019
that you are thinking about.

168
00:19:20,144 --> 00:19:29,373
Beyond that is the supra-conscious mind means
all the ideas about future you have had before,

169
00:19:29,691 --> 00:19:39,145
many lives before. Those ideas are there.
And beyond that is the collective supra-conscious.

170
00:19:39,723 --> 00:19:44,179
So, on the left hand side you have sub-conscious

171
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:53,050
and the collective sub-conscious; on the right hand side:
supra-conscious and the collective supra-conscious.

172
00:19:53,368 --> 00:20:01,891
Down below are the seven stratas of Hell. H.E.L.L.

173
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:06,235
Sometimes the words are so small that it doesn’t register.

174
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:12,584
If I say ‘Supra-conscious’, then people say,
“Ah! Mataji has said ‘sub-conscious’.” But ‘Hell’!

175
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:20,441
And Hell is a truth. It exists within us.

176
00:20:22,073 --> 00:20:29,533
It is there. And there are seven stratas of that also.

177
00:20:31,835 --> 00:20:37,358
Conscious mind [on Sushumna Nadhi-Central Channel]
also has got seven stratas

178
00:20:37,495 --> 00:20:44,138
which are built in within us through
our different evolutionary processes.

179
00:20:44,324 --> 00:20:49,798
And these are the seven stratas
which are placed here of the conscious mind

180
00:20:49,935 --> 00:20:55,647
and then you go on top of the head into super-conscious mind

181
00:20:56,101 --> 00:21:07,291
which is the subtle mind – is the eternal mind –
the unconscious in which you have to move in seven stratas.

182
00:21:08,425 --> 00:21:14,358
You may say, “Shri Mataji it’s too much!” But it’s not.

183
00:21:15,398 --> 00:21:17,926
You are already built-in for that.

184
00:21:18,205 --> 00:21:22,448
For example if I tell this light, “You have to get enlightened

185
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:28,156
and cover the whole hall”, it will say, “Oh! It’s too much.” No,
it is built like that.

186
00:21:28,315 --> 00:21:31,852
You have to just press the button. It opens and works

187
00:21:31,954 --> 00:21:39,312
because it is built that way, has been organized that way,
is placed that way that it works.

188
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:46,102
When we face things that seem difficult we think we have to do it

189
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:51,338
and that’s why we are worried. You don’t have to worry:
it’s already done

190
00:21:51,565 --> 00:21:59,805
and it will be done also by the One who is organizing it.

191
00:22:00,021 --> 00:22:03,716
Only thing what we have to do is to witness.

192
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,057
The One who has created this universe very well,

193
00:22:09,783 --> 00:22:15,620
the One who has created all the greenery

194
00:22:15,756 --> 00:22:22,774
then human being very well,

195
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:26,705
He is the One who is going to do this for you

196
00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:33,942
and the time has come as Gavin has said it beautifully
that the blossom time has come and it will work out.

197
00:22:35,418 --> 00:22:39,727
But it’s surprising you know, human beings sometimes
I cannot understand.

198
00:22:39,841 --> 00:22:45,787
When I told that it is going to work out they said,
“How can it be? It has to be difficult.”

199
00:22:47,681 --> 00:22:56,443
Before even starting about it must you sit down with this idea
on your head : “Oh! It’s going to be very difficult.”

200
00:22:56,647 --> 00:23:04,493
I say it is the easiest and the simplest thing.
Being so important it cannot be difficult.

201
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:09,674
Anything important like your breathing if it becomes
difficult and if you have to read about breathing,

202
00:23:09,753 --> 00:23:15,098
“How am I to breathe?” Now you go in books and see,
“Now, you have to do like this.”

203
00:23:15,189 --> 00:23:20,318
By the time you take the book, you are out.

204
00:23:20,636 --> 00:23:24,333
If you have to read about your Self Realization

205
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:28,777
then God saves the Self Realization and God saves you.

206
00:23:28,948 --> 00:23:32,655
It’s your right that you are going to get your Self Realization.

207
00:23:32,757 --> 00:23:37,497
I’m not pampering your Ego. But that’s how you have been made.

208
00:23:37,871 --> 00:23:46,333
Even your Ego which you are condemning every morning
and evening was an essential part of this being.

209
00:23:46,821 --> 00:23:55,369
Only ‘you’ the human beings have evolved
the Ego to know something on their own.

210
00:23:57,261 --> 00:24:04,582
So this mechanism was made specially in such a manner

211
00:24:04,742 --> 00:24:13,335
that through your Ego and your Super Ego
you have become an ‘I’ personality.

212
00:24:13,687 --> 00:24:18,731
Like people say, “This is Mister Kumar. This is X, this is Y.”

213
00:24:19,616 --> 00:24:27,064
You become a separate identity from that big One personality

214
00:24:27,405 --> 00:24:32,846
of which you are just separate.
And the consciousness of that comes to you

215
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:39,849
that you are a separate identity
and you have to see the oneness with that.

216
00:24:40,768 --> 00:24:43,301
And that is what is Self Realization.

217
00:24:45,212 --> 00:24:48,080
Nothing else!

218
00:24:49,001 --> 00:24:55,952
That you become that. Not what you do but is the becoming of it.

219
00:24:56,338 --> 00:24:59,659
Like you say a seed becomes a flower.

220
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,733
It becomes a flower. You don’t – the seed doesn’t go
and read a book, “Oh! I know what it is.”

221
00:25:07,063 --> 00:25:10,219
Or it doesn’t listen to any lecture of Mataji or anything,

222
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:15,865
 it just becomes a flower. In the same way you have to become that

223
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:23,476
and not just to be brain washed or to be done something else
which I will tell you later how per misuse you can do

224
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:27,410
 in the name of Self Realization.

225
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:32,852
So many of them are aware, it happened so. They know that.

226
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:34,909
But what happens you can know.

227
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:41,270
What is the mechanism? How it works out? Let us see the
positive side of it and then I will tell you the negative side.

228
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:48,118
There is a Kundalini placed in that triangular
bone that you can see

229
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:53,352
pulsate. We have a doctor here he will say that, yes,

230
00:25:54,112 --> 00:25:58,320
he has seen it. You can see the pulsation of
the Kundalini very clearly.

231
00:25:58,468 --> 00:26:03,468
You can see the rising of the Kundalini
very clearly with your naked eyes.

232
00:26:04,001 --> 00:26:08,760
You can also feel it coming up. It comes. How it comes?

233
00:26:08,964 --> 00:26:16,606
How it works out is another detailed program
which I may be able to tell you later on

234
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,800
or I have already told quite a lot about it.

235
00:26:21,436 --> 00:26:24,780
This comes up – the Kundalini –

236
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:31,651
and pierces your fontanel bone. Pierces! What is this Kundalini?

237
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:42,054
It is a residual force within you. Is awareness
which understands, thinks, loves and organizes, is an energy.

238
00:26:42,247 --> 00:26:49,288
Now we cannot think, human beings cannot think of
an energy that can think, love, organize.

239
00:26:49,447 --> 00:26:54,930
We cannot.
This is the energy that comes up you can see the pulsation.

240
00:26:55,203 --> 00:26:59,334
You can see the bringing of it with your naked eye.
That’s what you can bring here.

241
00:26:59,448 --> 00:27:05,262
It comes up and pierces your fontanel bone

242
00:27:06,282 --> 00:27:10,970
and you can feel the baptism that you become like a child

243
00:27:11,095 --> 00:27:16,831
because your fontanel bone becomes very soft.

244
00:27:17,081 --> 00:27:25,348
I mean, but that doesn’t mean that if you have a soft bone
here – that doesn’t mean that you are a Self realized person. No.

245
00:27:25,753 --> 00:27:29,728
When you enter not on left side or right hand side

246
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:34,690
but when you enter onto the top,
onto the first strata of the super-consciousness,

247
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:45,131
then what happens? First thing that should happen
to you is that you become one with the collective being.

248
00:27:48,284 --> 00:27:54,843
“You become”, again I say. It is not lecturing,
“We are all brothers and sisters.

249
00:27:55,229 --> 00:28:04,628
There should be no racism.” All this is lecturing.
I’m not saying lecturing. It’s ‘become’. How?

250
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:13,671
When this thing enters through this into that subtle form

251
00:28:14,148 --> 00:28:20,682
you start feeling from your hands a cool breeze flowing.

252
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,803
This is described in our scriptures.

253
00:28:24,015 --> 00:28:32,004
If you read even Christ has said, “Something passed out of My
body when somebody touched Me.” [Luke 8.46 transcriber’s note]

254
00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:39,123
But in our scriptures it’s given very, very clearly.
Here, in some of them, for example I would say Shankara .

255
00:28:39,362 --> 00:28:42,895
– Shankaracharya described that as Saundarya Lahari.

256
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:49,280
He called it as Saundarya Lahari this force somewhere.

257
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:56,000
He called as vibrations. So many people are talking
of vibrations but they don’t know what they’re talking

258
00:28:56,212 --> 00:29:02,402
These vibrations that flow from your hand are cool vibrations

259
00:29:02,852 --> 00:29:09,016
and also they understand, they think and heal other people.

260
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:16,661
When you put your hand towards another person
you start suddenly getting a burning here.

261
00:29:16,926 --> 00:29:23,576
Left hand side burning on this finger is
the Vishuddhi chakra, is this one.

262
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:27,967
Now, if you know the deity who is there

263
00:29:28,124 --> 00:29:32,015
and if you take the name of
that particular deity who is sitting here …

264
00:29:32,121 --> 00:29:36,195
If you know and if you are a Realized soul then only.

265
00:29:36,328 --> 00:29:40,401
If you are not Realized you have no authority.

266
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:49,317
You have no authority to take to any mantra
unless and until you are a Realized soul.

267
00:29:51,195 --> 00:29:54,310
Supposing I give you some mantra.

268
00:29:54,806 --> 00:29:59,528
You must know it is a misleading

269
00:30:01,513 --> 00:30:06,745
because whatever is said, whatever is the center in danger

270
00:30:06,924 --> 00:30:08,858
or in trouble,

271
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,962
you must get that one.

272
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:17,328
The one who is not a Realized soul cannot
make out what is the problem, where is the problem.

273
00:30:17,668 --> 00:30:20,426
And the one who is not Realized

274
00:30:20,526 --> 00:30:25,247
 if he is given the mantra, his mantra has no authority.

275
00:30:25,411 --> 00:30:28,958
Like if I want to go and see the Queen

276
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:32,985
I must take a permission. I must have some connection with her.

277
00:30:33,078 --> 00:30:38,739
I should be able to go and meet her. But if I go and meet
her straight and say, “Oh! Queen, come along.”

278
00:30:38,969 --> 00:30:42,663
The way we call God sometimes is most surprising.
You wouldn’t even call

279
00:30:42,705 --> 00:30:46,929
any servant like that the way we call Him,
“God, come along! Do this.

280
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:51,408
This is my problem. What are you doing for me?”

281
00:30:52,956 --> 00:30:58,729
 “I have faith in God” as if we have sort of
we are getting obligations.

282
00:30:58,889 --> 00:31:04,672
As if He is obliged to us,
“Oh! I have faith in God, Mother, then why did He miss it?”

283
00:31:04,871 --> 00:31:09,771
Who has faith? I mean, He exists.

284
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:17,668
He’s an eternal being. If you have faith in that,
‘you’ are very false fine, not ‘He’. You cannot add to His Dom

285
00:31:17,887 --> 00:31:23,232
Any mantra is given to you just by any Dick, Tom and Harry.

286
00:31:23,539 --> 00:31:27,954
Anyone coming, “I’ll give you a mantra.”
I’m going to tell you about them later on.

287
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:32,793
All those mantras that are said are for the deities,

288
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:38,066
were done by these Gurus as I told you
in ancient times for very few people.

289
00:31:38,205 --> 00:31:43,034
They used to raise the Kundalini very gradually.

290
00:31:43,094 --> 00:31:47,934
They used to take it from that seat which is the Mooladhara
– not the Mooladhara chakra

291
00:31:47,994 --> 00:31:52,328
– from that triangular bone and they used to raise it one by one.

292
00:31:52,419 --> 00:31:55,699
For seven years it used to hang into one center

293
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:58,873
then they would give one mantra, “All right, now, go and get it!

294
00:31:59,172 --> 00:32:02,842
Work it out! Cleanse it! Do it!” Then again another one.

295
00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:10,441
Then again another chakra. All right.
It has been done like that: very slow process.

296
00:32:10,705 --> 00:32:13,040
As in India, you see,

297
00:32:13,205 --> 00:32:18,536
they said that they have to go to Kashi or Benares.

298
00:32:18,735 --> 00:32:21,703
They used to sell out their houses, everything

299
00:32:21,961 --> 00:32:24,957
and they knew that they may never return.

300
00:32:25,037 --> 00:32:30,651
Or even if they go they might take so many years to reach Benares

301
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:35,770
that by that time they will be absolutely old people
and they would not have energy to return.

302
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:43,727
Now, if you have to go to Benares only thing what you can
do is to go from here to Delhi and take a plane and go direct.

303
00:32:43,985 --> 00:32:52,072
So ‘that’ time is over and Kundalini ‘now’

304
00:32:53,183 --> 00:32:55,762
can be worked out just like that

305
00:32:55,822 --> 00:32:59,373
because the time has come for you to become.

306
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:04,979
There were never so many seekers in the world before
I can tell you.

307
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:10,663
Only people who existed in the name of religion

308
00:33:10,763 --> 00:33:18,298
were orthodox, rabid, horrible people who crucified Christ,

309
00:33:18,894 --> 00:33:27,524
who killed Mohammad Sahib, who tortured Gnyaneshwara, who tortured

310
00:33:27,604 --> 00:33:32,683
Kabira, who tortured of all the things Shankaracharya,

311
00:33:33,537 --> 00:33:36,603
Buddha, Mahavira, Yuri [?], everyone of them.

312
00:33:36,751 --> 00:33:40,977
All these horrid people in the name of religion tortured.

313
00:33:41,116 --> 00:33:47,957
And today we have got this satanic thing

314
00:33:48,255 --> 00:33:52,223
coming out of that hell. They have suffered there,
you see, they were punished

315
00:33:52,283 --> 00:33:56,687
and after their punishment they are coming out.
It’s a double force.

316
00:33:57,064 --> 00:34:02,540
It’s a new subtler method of befooling you people.

317
00:34:03,533 --> 00:34:07,260
In Self Realization you get complete tranquility,

318
00:34:07,506 --> 00:34:15,779
the collective consciousness
and you can maneuver this power yourself.

319
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:21,156
It is ‘your’ power that is manifested and nobody else.

320
00:34:22,665 --> 00:34:29,048
But as you have been to all these satanic people
– most of you have been, last time I saw it

321
00:34:29,624 --> 00:34:35,199
– and when I told them [that I tried?],
means I’m working very hard, you know it. I’m working very hard

322
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:40,735
but some of them have really spoiled their path of Sushumna,
the central path.

323
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:48,256
So that is they have spoiled it that unless and until
they give up all that it’s not going to work out.

324
00:34:49,306 --> 00:34:53,531
If you are truly seeking I’m there to work for you.

325
00:34:53,928 --> 00:34:57,003
You don’t have to pay any money for it. No,

326
00:34:57,103 --> 00:35:05,951
never think of that because this is divine
and divine cannot be sold in the market.

327
00:35:08,015 --> 00:35:12,142
First thing that should come into your head as Christians specially

328
00:35:12,241 --> 00:35:16,689
that Christ has taken a hunter in his hand and hand it,
beating those people.

329
00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:22,205
That’s the only time He really lost his temper
on them when they were selling the religion.

330
00:35:22,285 --> 00:35:31,074
And today all of them are selling it
and you very, very humbly go and bow.

331
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:39,807
All kinds of these beggars and parasites have come in
this country and all over the western countries.

332
00:35:40,241 --> 00:35:43,239
They are nothing but beggars take it from me.

333
00:35:44,411 --> 00:35:49,770
Worse than beggars they are the worst culprits.

334
00:35:50,008 --> 00:35:52,270
So, this is what Self Realization is

335
00:35:52,389 --> 00:35:56,794
and in Self Realization you get all the blessings of God,

336
00:35:56,893 --> 00:35:59,928
gradually you go into thoughtless awareness

337
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:03,421
and then into doubtless awareness which we call Nirvikalpa

338
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:06,627
and then into Self Realization completely.

339
00:36:06,714 --> 00:36:09,703
In that we have some people in India

340
00:36:09,872 --> 00:36:13,334
– they have met them – who are completely Self Realized

341
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:17,421
and who, sitting down there, can work out
the Kundalini of other people.

342
00:36:17,541 --> 00:36:19,663
They are living in the family.

343
00:36:19,842 --> 00:36:21,446
They have got their children.

344
00:36:21,509 --> 00:36:24,581
They have got their grand-children. And they are working it out.

345
00:36:24,721 --> 00:36:26,865
You don’t have to run away from it.

346
00:36:26,945 --> 00:36:33,235
No extremes are needed, nothing.
It is ‘within you’ and ‘within you’ it is going to work out.

347
00:36:33,354 --> 00:36:39,068
These outside things and these extreme things are not needed.
Just be normal people.

348
00:36:39,108 --> 00:36:43,351
God has created this world for you to enjoy.

349
00:36:43,471 --> 00:36:48,669
It is for your enjoyment, you see,
these blessings that you have to feel through Self Realization.

350
00:36:48,753 --> 00:36:52,676
When the light of the Self flows in you see the joy pouring.

351
00:36:52,756 --> 00:36:57,423
You see it pouring from your head downwards
and you are just drenched.

352
00:36:57,756 --> 00:36:59,347
All your tensions go.

353
00:36:59,431 --> 00:37:00,974
All your problems go away.

354
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:05,637
The Ego and Superego which he has shown here
as the black and the yellow,

355
00:37:05,697 --> 00:37:08,315
both of them open up

356
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:12,492
and you see they’re going down.

357
00:37:13,881 --> 00:37:22,244
It happens. There is an imbalance, there is a
– some sort of a – hurt in you.

358
00:37:22,542 --> 00:37:27,720
Sometimes I can say there could a very great wound into you,

359
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:34,049
could be there are some spies sitting in you,
could be that you are possessed

360
00:37:34,205 --> 00:37:38,159
without knowing that you are possessed.

361
00:37:39,271 --> 00:37:42,822
You don’t know how these people have maneuvered

362
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:45,183
and I hope I will be able to tell you now

363
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,794
how they have maneuvered and what sort of horrid people they are.

364
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:52,108
I should take off my shoes perhaps.

365
00:37:59,172 --> 00:38:03,573
So, about these horrid people now.

366
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:11,835
In India since long,

367
00:38:12,609 --> 00:38:15,609
 if you say the origin of so-called tantrism

368
00:38:15,704 --> 00:38:20,788
which is just the position of real tantra

369
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:25,590
which is Sahaja Yoga, of the genuine tantra.

370
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:35,406
If tantrism is to be considered
as a genuine stuff then it is Sahaja Yoga.

371
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:38,400
But these tantrisms – these so-called

372
00:38:38,539 --> 00:38:42,467
– came into being in our country since long.

373
00:38:42,726 --> 00:38:50,681
Ancient times when these Gurus were
having those few disciples with them,

374
00:38:50,999 --> 00:38:54,722
three, four disciples were taken with great difficulties.

375
00:38:54,939 --> 00:38:57,499
But they were, after all, human beings.

376
00:38:57,622 --> 00:39:03,704
They used to be competition with them
and Guru would accept only one out of them

377
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:08,526
or two out of them, would take them a little ahead

378
00:39:08,685 --> 00:39:11,323
and would then leave them out saying that, “No.

379
00:39:11,542 --> 00:39:16,542
We cannot treat you anymore.
You cannot be helped. You’d better go away.”

380
00:39:17,197 --> 00:39:23,724
Such a useless, half-baked person would come down to the public

381
00:39:24,082 --> 00:39:30,023
and would start a method by which ‘he’ would put up a show against
[these fools?].

382
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:37,622
This is the beginning I would say.
So he would now sit down and meditate.

383
00:39:38,436 --> 00:39:43,197
Still, you know, as a Mother, I don’t want to condemn all of them.

384
00:39:43,515 --> 00:39:45,829
I will give them a benefit of doubt

385
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:54,857
and the benefit of doubt is this that when they were concentrating

386
00:39:54,976 --> 00:40:02,813
they tried to lift you into their Mooladhara chakra

387
00:40:03,171 --> 00:40:08,473
which you cannot enter in, which is below the Kundalini.

388
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:12,451
This Mooladhara chakra controls the sex.

389
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,367
Why? Because it is innocent.

390
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:20,963
It’s a child and the child as he doesn’t have

391
00:40:21,102 --> 00:40:32,104
sex that’s why it is not contaminated by it.
It is like a lotus coming out of the mud of sex.

392
00:40:32,799 --> 00:40:37,143
In that lotus sits Shri Ganesha.

393
00:40:37,362 --> 00:40:42,042
These people tried to peep into that

394
00:40:42,201 --> 00:40:45,772
thinking that through sex you might be able to see things

395
00:40:45,852 --> 00:40:51,486
and they might have seen – it is My own way of putting it

396
00:40:51,705 --> 00:40:57,319
– not seen completely but the trunk as you see.

397
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:05,699
And they might have confused it
– still I say – that trunk to be the Kundalini.

398
00:41:06,195 --> 00:41:09,449
When I tried to understand human beings

399
00:41:09,687 --> 00:41:17,405
I thought it may have been because how could man be
just entering into hell directly with all that sex.

400
00:41:17,584 --> 00:41:25,421
It’s too much to Me. So by mistake maybe, that they saw this.
All right?

401
00:41:25,779 --> 00:41:29,426
So first the tantrikas came in.

402
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:32,239
Tantrikas were the first.

403
00:41:32,372 --> 00:41:37,100
Then we have tantrikas
– basically I’m telling you- these evil geniuses are.

404
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:41,148
In the fact, you see, you cannot divide them

405
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:47,894
into all geniuses but you can give
a basic broad outline about these tantrikas.

406
00:41:48,053 --> 00:41:51,862
Tantrikas are the people who use sex

407
00:41:52,021 --> 00:41:55,235
for so-called Self Realization.

408
00:41:55,315 --> 00:42:01,366
Mantrikas are the people
who use mantras for so-called Self Realization.

409
00:42:01,763 --> 00:42:08,727
Then there are [Jakanikas?] who use evil geniuses

410
00:42:08,847 --> 00:42:13,707
to be introduced as evil spirits into human beings

411
00:42:13,986 --> 00:42:21,763
– called as [Janganikas?].
Then Paishachikas are the people who used

412
00:42:22,299 --> 00:42:30,377
supraconscious devils into human beings.
They are over dynamic, overambitious sort of people.

413
00:42:30,755 --> 00:42:35,814
We have got Aghoris who taught them to put uh,

414
00:42:35,894 --> 00:42:41,588
say they can put a uh put a diamond into their hands.

415
00:42:41,707 --> 00:42:50,437
Aghoris. Then we have got [Behunt?]
[Behunt?] are the people who can

416
00:42:50,695 --> 00:42:54,622
do horrible uh, horrible gestures,

417
00:42:54,761 --> 00:42:58,670
you see, they can pull their stomach in, push it here,

418
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:05,217
push it there, all sorts of things they do.
And we have also [Sexoyo?]. Minimum.

419
00:43:05,297 --> 00:43:08,186
I have categorized them as that

420
00:43:08,325 --> 00:43:15,150
but I don’t know how many sides of things there are
because when it comes to evil

421
00:43:15,329 --> 00:43:20,676
they come and prosper like viruses.

422
00:43:20,786 --> 00:43:25,934
Viruses they are. And they know how to hit you off.

423
00:43:26,173 --> 00:43:30,696
They themselves are destroying, they cannot see you constructing.

424
00:43:30,872 --> 00:43:40,909
They cannot see you evolve. That is one of
the basic reasons where they are out and oldies.

425
00:43:41,068 --> 00:43:46,088
So these tantrikas were started their jobs.

426
00:43:46,723 --> 00:43:56,462
In the Rama’s time, say about twelve hundred years back

427
00:43:56,701 --> 00:44:02,256
there was a Yajna, a kind of a ceremony known as Ashvamedha.

428
00:44:02,356 --> 00:44:09,148
It’s written in the books about that. Even that
– the books – the scriptures they ruined

429
00:44:09,228 --> 00:44:15,496
by saying that Ashvamedha was nothing else but was a sex act.

430
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:19,821
The Shakti and Shiva,

431
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,678
which is God who is innocent

432
00:44:22,758 --> 00:44:35,794
and His power the Shakti like light and the lamp or the sun
There also they introduced the symbol of sex.

433
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:43,052
This happened in the sixth century.

434
00:44:43,489 --> 00:44:49,759
It was at its heights tantrism in our country,
a complete bend. was taken.

435
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:53,303
Say Satjakuna [?] It was to Khajuraho.

436
00:44:53,326 --> 00:44:57,333
So much so they were influence people

437
00:44:57,577 --> 00:45:04,511
that all other scriptures were thrown into the rivers
and tantrism became the scripture of the Hindus.

438
00:45:05,095 --> 00:45:10,491
Thank God, by organized religion at least
you would not allow people to tamper too much with Bible.

439
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:15,491
Thought it was but not so much. It could have been.

440
00:45:15,611 --> 00:45:25,353
There is so much freedom, that licentiousness to do whatever
you please with that scripture.

441
00:45:25,512 --> 00:45:30,392
To get … Can you imagine? From this scripture they started spoiling

442
00:45:30,512 --> 00:45:35,128
 in the sixth century. Now what was the historical background for

443
00:45:35,188 --> 00:45:37,410
that? That was the best time,

444
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:41,695
best breeding time of these horrible people.

445
00:45:41,795 --> 00:45:50,009
Because at that time, as you too have
very extreme type of orthodox people,

446
00:45:50,307 --> 00:45:55,071
Jainism, now we have a sect of people called as Jainism.

447
00:45:55,487 --> 00:45:59,137
Now, horrid. I mean, all of them are.

448
00:45:59,221 --> 00:46:04,099
But one of them
– horrid things I can tell you – that they believe in vegetarianism

449
00:46:04,476 --> 00:46:09,312
to such an extent! It’s horrid thing to tell you

450
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:14,669
because – I’ve already told Gavin that for the first time
I’ll be shameless to tell you people –

451
00:46:14,789 --> 00:46:23,955
that they do not want to destroy
even the insects that are in the filth.

452
00:46:24,293 --> 00:46:26,074
To them an insect …
(tape interrupted)

453
00:46:26,197 --> 00:46:31,526
(…) so that lots of bugs can bite him

454
00:46:31,551 --> 00:46:35,717
and take out his blood and they pay him lot of money.

455
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:39,164
Is a fact. Even today they do sometimes in the villages.

456
00:46:39,303 --> 00:46:45,431
They think it’s the greatest punya, is the greatest.
What you say ‘Tapoyajna’, means?

457
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:50,791
Punya is a good deed, you see, religious deed, Is to make a man

458
00:46:51,129 --> 00:47:01,069
get inside a hut and bugs must come and they take the blood.

459
00:47:01,744 --> 00:47:06,974
So these Jains – so-called vegetarians, horrid –

460
00:47:07,093 --> 00:47:12,493
they were the ministers you know.
Some way or other they became ministers. So.

461
00:47:12,689 --> 00:47:20,287
And the maharajas – you know the word ‘raja’ is for the King –
were the Hindus.

462
00:47:20,466 --> 00:47:24,202
And Hindus as usual are very indifferent to religion.

463
00:47:24,322 --> 00:47:28,428
Whatever one may say about it,
I agree it is a very great country and all that

464
00:47:28,488 --> 00:47:33,865
but Hindus these days are even worse because now,
they have all become English, you see.

465
00:47:33,945 --> 00:47:38,150
With English education all of them have become English.
Westernized.

466
00:47:38,214 --> 00:47:41,481
They don’t think we have anything in our country.

467
00:47:42,357 --> 00:47:47,573
So these – that time – great Rajas

468
00:47:47,891 --> 00:47:55,330
who are so indifferent to religion, to their sustaining power,
to understand what is in their scriptures, licentious

469
00:47:55,569 --> 00:48:01,652
and permissive like your Roman kings, horribly Rajas,

470
00:48:02,089 --> 00:48:10,382
once they used to put their money to some sort of
an arrangement for all the licentious people around,

471
00:48:11,117 --> 00:48:19,370
so they thought of a very genius method, you see:
build the temple of God

472
00:48:20,085 --> 00:48:27,017
and make all kinds of erotic pictures in the temple.

473
00:48:27,303 --> 00:48:33,446
Can you believe that thing? In the name of art.

474
00:48:33,546 --> 00:48:40,430
If art is pure as people say, why do you need this vulgarity?

475
00:48:42,197 --> 00:48:47,611
Horrible erotic things were created through big competitions.

476
00:48:47,831 --> 00:48:50,726
Now you are having competitions in this country but that time

477
00:48:50,806 --> 00:48:54,714
– of course now you are also becoming tantrikas
as far as erotic things are concerned

478
00:48:54,814 --> 00:48:56,711
– one better than the other.

479
00:48:56,850 --> 00:49:00,798
And they were given special prices, even jagirs
– as they call the lands –

480
00:49:00,881 --> 00:49:04,814
were given to those people – it’s written in the history –

481
00:49:04,886 --> 00:49:10,486
for creating those pictures. Despite that, you see,
despite all that provocations

482
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:13,953
and despite all that temptations,

483
00:49:14,067 --> 00:49:18,588
you’ll be amazed, the konaraka, that art is departed.

484
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:23,608
There has been another thing, a simple thing is,
“Not. We’re ‘not’ going to do it.

485
00:49:23,668 --> 00:49:25,964
On a temple we are ‘not’ doing it.”

486
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:31,103
So these clever intelligent people, you see, they told them that,

487
00:49:31,222 --> 00:49:36,242
“If you do this, it will be good because all the dirt
that is here should be placed there”,

488
00:49:36,322 --> 00:49:39,436
you see, “and inside should be clean.

489
00:49:39,556 --> 00:49:42,452
Outside we must accept to God that we are like this.”

490
00:49:42,591 --> 00:49:46,194
This is a concession. See the brain,

491
00:49:47,444 --> 00:49:53,844
“This is a concession you must make what all dirty things
you are doing you put them out there.”

492
00:49:56,690 --> 00:50:00,797
This was the – this was the historical side here.

493
00:50:01,075 --> 00:50:06,142
And that time these tantrikas were,
you see, absolutely horrid they came.

494
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:12,369
You have only one Soho. We have Sohos
and Sohos and Sohos in that great country.

495
00:50:12,687 --> 00:50:16,964
You won’t believe when you see those things, you know,

496
00:50:17,143 --> 00:50:20,675
foreigners are surprised that in India
such erotic things are there.

497
00:50:20,774 --> 00:50:29,306
Wherever there is religion, wherever there is a saint,
these satanic have to reach there to destroy all that is pure.

498
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:34,551
That is their style, their “happiness”.
This is a crucifixion of the purity.

499
00:50:36,132 --> 00:50:39,428
And such temples were created

500
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:44,269
and those tantrikas then came forward.

501
00:50:44,369 --> 00:50:53,517
They brought about all their women there for konaraka. If
you go there is the Chausath Bhavani Mandir, they call it

502
00:50:53,558 --> 00:50:57,291
“the sixty-four goddesses”. Imagine Goddesses’ temple!

503
00:50:57,466 --> 00:51:01,752
Now what do they do? Now what is the principle behind all that,

504
00:51:01,881 --> 00:51:06,081
you must know. It is a very secretive principle that they use.

505
00:51:06,871 --> 00:51:13,918
They establish the picture of a Goddess
or create a statue of a Goddess in a chapel

506
00:51:14,017 --> 00:51:20,426
and before the Goddess they do nirvicara,
means sex act of sixteen varieties of different types.

507
00:51:20,486 --> 00:51:25,406
Horrible! In the beginning Shri Ganesha gets angry.

508
00:51:25,525 --> 00:51:31,299
They get all kinds of blisters all around. They – they say
that Kundalini is angry. Kundalini, why will She be angry?

509
00:51:31,383 --> 00:51:38,447
It is Shri Ganesha who is angry, but in such a temper
from the right and the left and they get all blisters.

510
00:51:38,625 --> 00:51:42,663
They start dancing, jumping, they behave like frogs,

511
00:51:42,742 --> 00:51:49,270
they have horrid things. They get blasted in the head,

512
00:51:49,381 --> 00:51:53,585
they get headaches, everything they get.
But still they are adamant

513
00:51:53,665 --> 00:51:58,228
because it is said that, “You have to go further.
It’s a terrible task,

514
00:51:58,328 --> 00:52:02,554
it’s a difficult task. These are your
Karmas that are coming to torture you.

515
00:52:02,634 --> 00:52:08,634
You have to take out your Karmas.
Through your sex you do better Karmas or bad Karmas.”

516
00:52:08,765 --> 00:52:11,581
So they go on poor people.

517
00:52:12,336 --> 00:52:18,680
Then, by that, beyond that what happens is deities slip off.

518
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:24,057
They go away from there. The area is built-in.

519
00:52:24,156 --> 00:52:30,525
The realm of God from there disappears
as light disappears in the darkness.

520
00:52:30,724 --> 00:52:33,938
They work in the night. They’ll never work in the daytime.

521
00:52:34,047 --> 00:52:38,501
In the night they work and then they call the spirits.

522
00:52:38,819 --> 00:52:44,306
You can call them. Last time I told you what happens to
you when you die and how the spirits are there

523
00:52:44,365 --> 00:52:48,234
and what are the horrible spirits
that are hanging around us to enter into you.

524
00:52:48,314 --> 00:52:52,500
So I will not go into the details of that but later on
I’ll tell you all about it.

525
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:56,349
 I’ll tell you each and everything. You note it down.

526
00:52:56,588 --> 00:52:59,345
So they start, they call the spirits.

527
00:52:59,505 --> 00:53:08,386
When they call the spirits – spirits have the lust in them,
greed, they’re greedy, you see, really dissatisfied –

528
00:53:08,486 --> 00:53:12,952
and they maneuver them. They can give them the name of say ‘Rama’,

529
00:53:13,347 --> 00:53:18,148
then ‘Aim’, ‘Hrim’, ‘Klim’, all sorts of names
they can give to these spirits,

530
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:21,541
these evil geniuses manage them.

531
00:53:23,307 --> 00:53:27,850
And then they put these spirits on the king,

532
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:33,727
onto his big ministers. And these
people are captured and possessed.

533
00:53:33,821 --> 00:53:35,731
And they say, “We are very erotic.

534
00:53:35,811 --> 00:53:42,944
We are running after – we used to run after only two women,
now we are running after hundred women.” Mad!

535
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:46,328
They lose all their sense of Self.

536
00:53:46,468 --> 00:53:49,868
They have no understanding of what they are doing.

537
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:54,205
Like mad they do. Even some saints can be affected

538
00:53:54,305 --> 00:53:56,639
but they get reactions physically.

539
00:53:56,984 --> 00:54:01,184
Saints if they indulge into it immediately they get reactions.

540
00:54:01,381 --> 00:54:04,381
They get reactions in the head, in the body.

541
00:54:04,547 --> 00:54:10,014
And the reactions could be very strong on them.
Sometimes they vomit too much.

542
00:54:10,466 --> 00:54:15,763
So ‘these’ people start putting those horrible

543
00:54:16,041 --> 00:54:19,612
sexes on you, capturing you, taking out your being.

544
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:23,042
In India there was a tantrika like that

545
00:54:23,142 --> 00:54:26,653
who amassed lot of money but his wife [has pushed?] him throughout

546
00:54:26,733 --> 00:54:31,466
and he built that horrible temple of that Konaraka
[Temple near Puri].

547
00:54:34,551 --> 00:54:38,791
If he had not put any erotic’s there
it would have been a beautiful temple

548
00:54:38,871 --> 00:54:42,264
but with that erotic you feel like vomiting
all the time when you go.

549
00:54:42,383 --> 00:54:47,206
I mean, if you are healthy, you just can’t bear to see
those kinds of bathroom, the way it is done.

550
00:54:47,286 --> 00:54:55,083
Tomorrow they will ask us to watch
these people sitting down there for the morning ablutions!

551
00:54:55,838 --> 00:55:02,345
 Filth and filth and filth! The whole place is nothing but filth.

552
00:55:03,655 --> 00:55:10,083
And then his own son defied him, this horrible tantrika.

553
00:55:10,501 --> 00:55:13,781
This tantrika was killed in a very funny manner

554
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,361
which is worth reading how he was killed.

555
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:19,684
And the son came down and he completed that temple
[In legends the architect’s son committed suicide jumping from the top of the temple.]

556
00:55:19,754 --> 00:55:23,315
but he told the King that, “Your kingdom will disappear.”

557
00:55:23,454 --> 00:55:28,829
All these – all these kings disappeared once for all.
They had no children,

558
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:36,943
they had nothing and they became just shamble
and all of their temples were covered

559
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:41,053
with stones, earth and they were just mounts.

560
00:55:41,133 --> 00:55:44,208
Later on the English came there

561
00:55:44,381 --> 00:55:46,906
and some of them excavated and found out.

562
00:55:46,986 --> 00:55:51,450
They found it artistic, I don’t know how
they found it but it was there.

563
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:57,799
But in Konaraka you will find the whole thing is so vulgar,

564
00:55:58,157 --> 00:56:03,834
so horrid, where the artists – poor things – had nothing to say.

565
00:56:04,648 --> 00:56:08,537
And I met the artists of that place who are living around.

566
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:14,172
They said, “We are paying through our drones
all these days for what our forefathers have done

567
00:56:14,748 --> 00:56:17,763
and we don’t want to see that.”

568
00:56:18,498 --> 00:56:25,908
Even today in India an unmarried man and
an unmarried woman will never go to see a konaraka.

569
00:56:26,761 --> 00:56:30,895
Now the only explanation they have is this, you’ll be amazed,

570
00:56:31,007 --> 00:56:36,813
that after marriage Indian women are so innocent as that
they’re married quite young, they don’t understand what is sex,

571
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:41,793
so teach them how what is sex. It is made for the marriage

572
00:56:41,972 --> 00:56:44,432
and only the husband and wife should go there.

573
00:56:44,532 --> 00:56:49,998
This is the only explanation our Indian
artists could find out to give for that.

574
00:56:51,047 --> 00:56:52,406
But we have to accept.

575
00:56:52,505 --> 00:56:56,652
You see, in every country there could be a satanic force working.

576
00:56:56,751 --> 00:57:00,951
Why should we identify ourselves with those horrible tantrikas

577
00:57:02,267 --> 00:57:04,801
and why should we be ashamed of that?

578
00:57:07,505 --> 00:57:12,068
In Khajuraho the other tantric place you will find

579
00:57:12,168 --> 00:57:17,842
there are some places where you find eroticas.

580
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:26,612
But if you are alert and if you watch,
these are kept in corners somewhere

581
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:33,703
while the gods and goddesses have
big form, back, very great attachment, such a thing.

582
00:57:33,823 --> 00:57:40,509
So it never comes to your notice unless and until you are
taken to it and shown out that this is an erotica.

583
00:57:40,648 --> 00:57:48,470
But surprisingly most of the foreigners are specially
Japanese bringing their camera from this angle, from this angle.

584
00:57:48,704 --> 00:57:51,526
Why don’t they take their own photographs like that?

585
00:57:51,705 --> 00:57:55,078
What is there to go all the way
to Konaraka to take those photographs?

586
00:57:55,197 --> 00:57:57,816
Shows your search!

587
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:00,712
Shows what you are asking for!

588
00:58:00,891 --> 00:58:04,688
The way from here people take all the way those big – big – cameras

589
00:58:04,808 --> 00:58:09,767
and go round. They take photographs like various angles they look.

590
00:58:10,046 --> 00:58:13,676
What is there to take photographs? In that what is there to gain?

591
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:19,156
Sex, animals know, everybody knows, dog knows.
What is there to teach about sex?

592
00:58:20,661 --> 00:58:25,194
You have done so much of mentally that now there will be impotency.

593
00:58:25,381 --> 00:58:31,275
And in there, you know that, in America,
the highest number impotent are there

594
00:58:31,414 --> 00:58:36,614
because of this kind of perversion and ruining
your innocence within yourself.

595
00:58:37,783 --> 00:58:39,668
Beware of it!

596
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:51,652
This so-called freedom is nothing but abandonment of
your sustenance of your Dharma that is within you. Is built-in.

597
00:58:53,061 --> 00:58:57,878
It is there. It exists. You cannot from,

598
00:58:58,712 --> 00:59:06,886
“Thou shall not commit adultery.” Christ has said, “Not only
adultery but I will say, ‘Thou shall not have adulterous eyes’.”

599
00:59:06,985 --> 00:59:09,525
And you see people, all the time they…

600
00:59:09,605 --> 00:59:13,057
And they say, “We are intelligent.” What did happen?

601
00:59:13,156 --> 00:59:16,767
Where are you looking?
Where are you seeing? Where is your attention?

602
00:59:16,906 --> 00:59:19,961
This human attention built up ages.

603
00:59:22,065 --> 00:59:27,932
So much has been worked out. You have been
brought from that level to this level today.

604
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:34,957
Where are you getting? Into gutters, into filth, into dirt.

605
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:48,214
Rise! And see your glory. Have your self-respect.
As a Mother, I tell you that.

606
00:59:49,008 --> 00:59:51,753
And these horrible tantrikas and mantrikas

607
00:59:51,845 --> 00:59:58,400
who are teaching you all kinds of things like putting a mandala
– the other day somebody told Me – and putting your sex there.

608
00:59:58,519 --> 01:00:01,079
What is a mandala? Do you know is the aura of God?

609
01:00:01,178 --> 01:00:03,519
You are showing your sex to God!

610
01:00:03,658 --> 01:00:07,507
Have some brains at least if nothing else.

611
01:00:08,023 --> 01:00:14,604
It’s the greatest shameful thing you are doing
if you show your sex part to God.

612
01:00:15,021 --> 01:00:21,469
Are you all lunatics? Can’t you understand? It’s a ceremony!

613
01:00:24,941 --> 01:00:26,807
I get upset with those

614
01:00:27,105 --> 01:00:31,529
because you don’t know. You will lose
all your chances of Realization.

615
01:00:31,714 --> 01:00:37,663
Your seeking is going to be lost completely, believe Me.

616
01:00:38,946 --> 01:00:44,151
Stand in your own glory. Why should you run after women?
Why should you run after men?

617
01:00:44,251 --> 01:00:48,933
If you are a glorious person, stand in your own image.

618
01:00:49,330 --> 01:00:53,064
That’s the best way you are going to be a human being.

619
01:00:53,854 --> 01:01:00,203
This kind of licentiousness and permissiveness is
going to completely finish that chakra in the Nabhi.

620
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:07,287
If you see that one has got ten petals which are
built so carefully, delicately, beautifully, with love.

621
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:14,161
Do not confuse love with licentious behavior.

622
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,820
It is ‘not’.

623
01:01:18,881 --> 01:01:20,947
It’s sanctified love.

624
01:01:21,253 --> 01:01:25,460
I don’t say you become sanyasin, not at all,
I’m against that also, another extreme.

625
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:29,706
Then I’m going to tell you about sexo-yogis, the third time.

626
01:01:30,381 --> 01:01:37,596
The sexo-yogis start as a people who are
suppressing their sex. They do not marry. (Tape interruption)

627
01:01:42,437 --> 01:01:44,001
They use

628
01:01:44,026 --> 01:01:46,405
– they use the skull of a lady.

629
01:01:46,422 --> 01:01:52,173
They need skulls for that.
To be in the subconscious you have to have a skull.

630
01:01:52,385 --> 01:01:58,264
So they kill people, take out their skulls and keep it with them.

631
01:01:58,622 --> 01:02:02,530
Some people are coming, please open door.

632
01:02:02,908 --> 01:02:07,094
So the – they keep those skulls with them

633
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:11,346
and those skulls they use it for drinking water,

634
01:02:11,744 --> 01:02:15,890
for eating food, all the time these skulls are there.

635
01:02:16,228 --> 01:02:25,077
Now there is a very good story written by a great writer in
India, Bankim Chandra [Chattopadhyay], is known as Kapal Kundala.

636
01:02:25,334 --> 01:02:32,080
This girl, there was a girl whom a Kapali [Mahadji?],

637
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:36,396
he used to make her nude, he used to make her dance,

638
01:02:36,476 --> 01:02:41,614
he used to make her go in the see
and used to control his sex sitting before her.

639
01:02:41,793 --> 01:02:47,586
And there are several also, very sexual acts he would control also.

640
01:02:48,023 --> 01:02:52,606
He went on like that and ultimately he wants to kill that girl.

641
01:02:52,785 --> 01:03:00,557
That is the height of complete abstinence
because you kill the person whom you were supposed to have.

642
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:05,854
Just imagine, what perversion! What brain! What habits!

643
01:03:06,331 --> 01:03:14,998
I mean there’s no limit to this. God has not given you freedom
to break your head and to say that, “Oh, bull come and hit me!”

644
01:03:15,438 --> 01:03:22,858
And this girl was preserved and then someway
or other she ran away and she got married to a man.

645
01:03:23,037 --> 01:03:26,237
He visited her, brought her back and killed her.

646
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:33,688
These are the Kapali.

647
01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:35,791
If you don’t listen to them,

648
01:03:35,816 --> 01:03:38,703
they will take you to the smashana that is the burial ground,

649
01:03:38,728 --> 01:03:42,768
cut your head, take out your skull and keep it.

650
01:03:42,874 --> 01:03:46,483
They will see to it that you go to the subconscious strata

651
01:03:46,684 --> 01:03:49,137
and they handle you better there.

652
01:03:49,162 --> 01:03:55,173
They would like to die through their stamina.

653
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:56,840
They do it.

654
01:03:57,237 --> 01:04:02,561
So many of them are doing like that. Even today, you have no idea.

655
01:04:02,654 --> 01:04:05,849
And people are so much enamored,

656
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:08,977
so much under the obsession of these things are,

657
01:04:09,077 --> 01:04:13,401
that even if you tell them that your gurus are
doing like this and they have found out,

658
01:04:13,501 --> 01:04:16,034
still they will be there to kill you.

659
01:04:16,378 --> 01:04:21,178
Absolutely rabid people. They are possessed,
brain-washed completely.

660
01:04:21,815 --> 01:04:24,632
And if some people should be saved, to say…

661
01:04:24,751 --> 01:04:34,116
I always say that if a sari keeps flying out,
even if you could hold a little bit of it, we can save this sari.

662
01:04:35,109 --> 01:04:39,775
The sanity must come to you to understand
that these horrible methods

663
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:43,341
are not going to give you Self Realization.

664
01:04:44,137 --> 01:04:46,870
You must know what is Self Realization.

665
01:04:47,014 --> 01:04:50,505
Now some people think that flying in the air,

666
01:04:50,704 --> 01:04:53,873
jumping somewhere is something great.

667
01:04:55,644 --> 01:05:00,644
Which incarnation did? Did you hear any incarnation
[Delete ‘who walked’],

668
01:05:00,819 --> 01:05:06,612
who sat like this and was floating in the air?

669
01:05:07,148 --> 01:05:12,565
Which incarnation did that and what are you going to
do with floating in the air? You are going to

670
01:05:12,962 --> 01:05:14,787
create a problem on the traffic.

671
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:22,833
These nonsensical things why should you do?

672
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:26,919
There is in Puna [Shivapur],
they say there is one saint who died, you see,

673
01:05:27,049 --> 01:05:28,449
and there is a stone,

674
01:05:29,242 --> 01:05:33,025
 if there ten people take the name of the saint, it can come up.

675
01:05:33,172 --> 01:05:35,644
And you can put a finger, it can come up.

676
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:42,212
I said, “With that what God should do?” Think of it!

677
01:05:42,649 --> 01:05:44,533
And when I went there I found out

678
01:05:44,712 --> 01:05:50,763
that there was a big spirit sitting there and he said, “I’m going
to sit down here Mother. I’m not going to do [other thing?].”

679
01:05:50,903 --> 01:05:54,198
And the spirit of that horrible fellow
is all the time sitting there.

680
01:05:54,316 --> 01:05:55,726
He doesn’t want anything.

681
01:05:55,806 --> 01:06:01,939
He just want to meet good people and sit down there
and listen everybody’s taking his name,

682
01:06:02,148 --> 01:06:06,930
calling him a saint. When he is not a saint why should
we accept that he is a saint

683
01:06:07,048 --> 01:06:12,848
and be happy with it? Because human beings can do anything.
They have given that power.

684
01:06:14,311 --> 01:06:17,065
And moreover God is powerless before you

685
01:06:17,152 --> 01:06:20,914
because He cannot take away your freedom to be idiots

686
01:06:20,974 --> 01:06:25,894
or to be foolish or to be self-destroying. He cannot do it.

687
01:06:25,954 --> 01:06:32,491
He can only weep and cry, beg on you,
“Please don’t do it, please don’t do it”, but He cannot stop it.

688
01:06:32,839 --> 01:06:39,205
That’s the only problem. And that’s why all of them have taken you.

689
01:06:39,337 --> 01:06:43,689
They have all come from somewhere like spiders.
At least I know fifteen of them.

690
01:06:43,848 --> 01:06:49,715
And three horrible women. They’re all there making money,
making money, befooling you.

691
01:06:53,295 --> 01:07:00,299
Why do you need a guru for telling you a mantra?
Any Dick, Tom, Harry can tell you.

692
01:07:00,577 --> 01:07:05,081
You must see the result, the proof.

693
01:07:06,450 --> 01:07:11,250
What’s happening out of it.
You must think. You are intelligent people.

694
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:17,900
You understand everything, why don’t you understand this,
“I’m possessed.”

695
01:07:18,357 --> 01:07:22,206
Are you under the complete obsession of such people?

696
01:07:22,306 --> 01:07:26,641
Or perhaps you have paid them so much money that you think,
“Oh how we have paid so much now what,

697
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:28,506
we should see through the whole thing.”

698
01:07:28,685 --> 01:07:33,010
Like in the drama you go and you don’t like the drama, still
when you have paid the money, then stand.

699
01:07:33,248 --> 01:07:36,541
It’s not that casual.

700
01:07:36,621 --> 01:07:42,196
It’s a very serious thing. You are going into the den of devils,

701
01:07:42,435 --> 01:07:47,765
finishing your Kundalini completely. Now there are
at least twenty-five people among you who will say that.

702
01:07:47,865 --> 01:07:53,221
It has happened to them. I’ve been correcting them.
I’m doing it. They get it back.

703
01:07:53,698 --> 01:07:59,031
I only feel sorry for one thing,
that you have been genuine about your seeking.

704
01:07:59,293 --> 01:08:04,878
You have been genuinely seeking and
I can assure you that I went to America in 1970

705
01:08:04,978 --> 01:08:11,644
to warn on you but that time they were,
all of them had become something special type of possessed.

706
01:08:12,974 --> 01:08:18,846
They would not listen to Me. I told Ravi Shankar. He said,
“Mother you just don’t go near them. They will eat you out.”

707
01:08:19,045 --> 01:08:25,017
That out to have experiences of torn fulsome drugs.

708
01:08:26,208 --> 01:08:29,969
In India how many people have seen the drugs
– ask them, anyone of them ?

709
01:08:30,049 --> 01:08:35,383
Ha! Do they even know what is the difference
between bhang and this and that?

710
01:08:39,137 --> 01:08:42,937
These drugs and all these things were used by tantrikas.

711
01:08:43,164 --> 01:08:46,631
And they are out here. They have brought out that.

712
01:08:47,549 --> 01:08:51,834
Things that go against your awareness
whether drugs, alcohol, anything

713
01:08:51,994 --> 01:08:56,927
 is ‘not’ going to give you that higher awareness about
which I’m saying.

714
01:08:58,359 --> 01:09:05,938
Don’t waste your life. It’s very precious.
The most precious and the greatest time has come.

715
01:09:07,347 --> 01:09:12,287
Please respect yourself. And please understand your value.

716
01:09:12,644 --> 01:09:17,069
What you have learned before, find it out and do not waste it.

717
01:09:17,367 --> 01:09:21,493
You have already wasted lot of your time.

718
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:27,495
Means all these – I told you the seven stratas –

719
01:09:27,753 --> 01:09:32,589
on the left and right have names which I think that time

720
01:09:32,749 --> 01:09:37,431
I have no time to tell you but there are
names and names and names for everything.

721
01:09:37,610 --> 01:09:41,466
Hakini, Rakini, Lakini, Shakini,
like that on the left hand side they have got.

722
01:09:41,558 --> 01:09:45,084
This side is Gayatri and Savitri and all that sorts of things.

723
01:09:45,203 --> 01:09:54,278
It goes on both the sides.
All these are nothing but like resonances.

724
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:57,019
They throw you from one to another strata.

725
01:09:57,178 --> 01:09:59,350
You are sort of tested in every strata

726
01:09:59,450 --> 01:10:04,866
and when they found you are a gone case you go ‘direct’ into hell.

727
01:10:05,105 --> 01:10:07,525
These are all achieved!

728
01:10:14,212 --> 01:10:18,041
So I have to make a very simple

729
01:10:18,656 --> 01:10:23,077
statement that keep your Self, respect your Self.

730
01:10:23,514 --> 01:10:29,961
Try. If it works with you, well and good. I’m here to work out the

731
01:10:30,121 --> 01:10:35,973
raising of the Kundalini, the bringing it out of it.
You yourself would be able to do after some time

732
01:10:36,212 --> 01:10:39,945
but cleansing is needed and it should never be given up

733
01:10:40,041 --> 01:10:42,600
because there is no way out.

734
01:10:45,319 --> 01:10:47,836
Nanak – Guru Nanak –

735
01:10:48,293 --> 01:10:56,259
he has written at least three-four chapters against these
tantrikas and mantrikas and these paishakshikas and these jains.

736
01:10:56,656 --> 01:11:03,084
In India it’s an abuse to say – I mean I have first time used
these words for that on my tongue –

737
01:11:03,361 --> 01:11:08,362
 is an abuse to call somebody like this.
If you say that to someone they will take you to the court.

738
01:11:08,561 --> 01:11:11,514
They are kept outside like lepers.

739
01:11:15,364 --> 01:11:23,291
Kabira has written books after books. These khecharis
and this and that he lashed them left and right,

740
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:25,315
He was a great poet.

741
01:11:25,424 --> 01:11:28,211
Everybody fought with him, tortured him.

742
01:11:28,291 --> 01:11:29,918
Christ was the same.

743
01:11:30,236 --> 01:11:33,926
He is the one who said not to go towards spirits at all.

744
01:11:34,091 --> 01:11:35,824
This is all spirit’s job.

745
01:11:37,081 --> 01:11:42,014
But you go in London every fifth house is
a spiritualist sitting there,

746
01:11:42,299 --> 01:11:45,116
“Free hypnotics!”

747
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:51,739
Why do you want to get hypnotized? Why do you want to get

748
01:11:51,879 --> 01:11:56,342
E.S.P – what they call – Extra Sensory Perception?

749
01:11:57,077 --> 01:12:03,823
All these so-called geniuses also,
these prodigies are also possessed.

750
01:12:04,398 --> 01:12:06,379
I’ve seen many prodigies.

751
01:12:06,462 --> 01:12:10,923
One of them came to Me. I told,
“All right, in My presence you calculate.”

752
01:12:11,043 --> 01:12:14,197
She could not calculate even in one

753
01:12:14,495 --> 01:12:20,546
because I put a bandhan to her possession. I said, “You get out!”

754
01:12:20,904 --> 01:12:25,116
I’ve had many such experiences which I can tell you.
Last time I’ve told you

755
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:30,771
how people who are possessed came to Me and how they leave.

756
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:39,382
Now there is still time and we can
move into Self Realization experience.

757
01:12:39,482 --> 01:12:43,211
It will – it might take to some people in five minutes
but to some more.

758
01:12:43,291 --> 01:12:47,939
In any case you must have patience. And don’t be angry with you.

759
01:12:48,113 --> 01:12:53,335
Because when Gavin said Ego – I was fired when he said –
because if it is not Ego then the Superego comes,

760
01:12:53,495 --> 01:12:59,895
“We are the worst people, we are the horrible people.
We…” you see, from one extreme to another.

761
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:06,880
You have to stand in-between. You are glorious.

762
01:13:07,336 --> 01:13:11,890
You are not an aggressor neither
you are taking aggression from anyone.

763
01:13:12,029 --> 01:13:17,544
You stand within your Self and through
that you have your own powers.

764
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:22,281
You don’t have to depend on anyone, nothing. You just are.

765
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:25,317
But you have to depend on the deities that are within you,

766
01:13:25,424 --> 01:13:29,424
which I’m going to see. There has been a problem.
They have to be corrected

767
01:13:29,524 --> 01:13:33,254
and you have to know where are the deities, where are they.

768
01:13:33,373 --> 01:13:38,426
In the Sahaja Yoga – modern Sahaja Yoga I may call it –
there is no mantra given.

769
01:13:38,593 --> 01:13:43,466
No. Because every second the Kundalini is going like that.
Now there are people who’ll say,

770
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:47,077
“This I can tell you, this I can tell you.”
It is here they saw that.

771
01:13:47,157 --> 01:13:53,109
You must have seen she came to Me, She tells Me that,
“Mother I’ve caught that.” All right, finished. Agnya catching.

772
01:13:53,268 --> 01:13:58,161
So nobody is given a mantra but you know where is the catch.
You yourself say.

773
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:01,787
She herself came and told Me, “I’ve got it caught on Agnya.”

774
01:14:01,926 --> 01:14:06,330
And you know what’s the extreme Agnya catching means,
you know: paranoia.

775
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:12,310
But she doesn’t mind telling Me because she sees herself
away from herself and she told Me, “I’ve got an Agnya clearly.”

776
01:14:12,567 --> 01:14:15,872
All of them say, “The Agnya is there.
I can see those coming inside me.”

777
01:14:16,011 --> 01:14:22,578
He told Me that, “I can see these entities now coming into me.”
And I throw them away and they have a nice – a nice program.

778
01:14:22,757 --> 01:14:27,836
If you all talk to them, they will tell you their experiences.
Some of them went into trance; I had to take them out.

779
01:14:27,956 --> 01:14:31,725
So many things happen now. People just like you came to Me
and gained.

780
01:14:31,864 --> 01:14:36,331
And you’ll also gain but be sensible about it, be wise. Be wise.

781
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:43,894
You have to expect gains and nothing else.
Nothing else you can found.

782
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:45,976
So, may God bless you.

783
01:14:46,176 --> 01:14:49,390
You can go into a little meditation

784
01:14:49,521 --> 01:14:52,064
just by putting your hands towards Me
