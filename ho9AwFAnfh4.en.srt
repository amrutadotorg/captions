1
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:12,190
Today is the nineteenth Sahasrara Day.

2
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,990
If you count the first one the day the Sahasrara was opened.

3
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,710
I'll have to tell..

4
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,110
I'll have to tell you the story

5
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,510
about the Sahasrara day,

6
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:36,790
about which it was decided, long time back,

7
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,230
before I incarnated.

8
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,950
They had a big meeting in the heavens,

9
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:01,390
all the thirty-five crores (3.5 million)

10
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:09,070
of Gods, the deities were there present

11
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,110
to decide what is to be done.

12
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:24,110
This is the ultimate that we have to give to human beings,

13
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:30,030
is to open their Sahasrara;

14
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:36,350
to open their awareness to the Spirit;

15
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:47,270
to the real knowledge of the Divine.

16
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:55,190
To remove the darkness of ignorance,

17
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:03,470
and it had to be spontaneously,

18
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,910
because it has to work - the living force of God.

19
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,430
Also it had to be very quick.

20
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,230
So all the Gods requested that now,

21
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,550
I, the Adi Shakti, has to take the birth.

22
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,990
They all tried their best.

23
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,270
They did whatever was possible,

24
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:39,830
the saints were made by them, but very few.

25
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:47,950
They incarnated and people made religions out of them

26
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:53,350
which were perverted - brought them bad name.

27
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:57,670
No reality in those religions.

28
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,790
These religions were money oriented

29
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,430
or power oriented.

30
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:13,910
There was no Divine force working, actually it was all anti-divine.

31
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,070
How to now turn human beings

32
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,230
away from these superficial religions,

33
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:34,270
these perverted paths of destruction.

34
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:40,110
How to tell them about all these established organisations.

35
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,550
For ages they have been ruling,

36
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,190
making money, making power.

37
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,550
It was a tremendous task,

38
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:01,670
had to be done with great patience and the love.

39
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,950
It was a very delicate work also,

40
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,270
because they believed in those religions,

41
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,990
innocent people, simple people.

42
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,110
To blast them that this is all nonsense,

43
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,670
UNCLEAR (they/there) are no religions,

44
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,830
they are against incarnations, against all the prophets,

45
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,550
against all the saints.

46
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,430
That's why all the real saints had to suffer.

47
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,390
It's a powerful work that was to be done,

48
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:39,790
and that's why Adi Shakti had to take birth on this earth.

49
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,350
It had to be before the sixth of May

50
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:53,510
because sixth of May was the doomsday in that year.

51
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,870
It was done on the fifth of May at the nick of time.

52
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,030
It was all decided beforehand,

53
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:12,550
and every deity's job was allotted to all of them.

54
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,670
Very efficient deities, very obedient,

55
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,510
they knew me very well.

56
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,430
Completely dedicated and devoted.

57
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,830
They knew me very very well,

58
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:38,950
every end of my hair, they knew.

59
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,910
I didn't have to teach them protocol,

60
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,550
love itself gives you protocol

61
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,750
but love that is Divine, is not selfish love.

62
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:59,910
It's not the way we love my child, my husband,

63
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:04,110
my country, my clothes.

64
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,950
It is the love

65
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,670
which is Divine,

66
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:22,390
which spreads from your heart,

67
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,150
from your Spirit,

68
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:31,230
like the light of knowledge.

69
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,390
What a tremendous task it was.

70
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,790
So I said, at Sahasrara

71
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,510
I had to be Mahamaya.

72
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:53,470
I had to be Mahamaya. I had to be something

73
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,790
that people can't recognise me easily.

74
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:01,150
But deities know!

75
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,270
This Mahamaya had to come on this earth,

76
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:11,110
not the Adi Shakti in her purest form, it's too much.

77
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:17,430
So she was covered with this Mahamaya.

78
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,910
Now you see,

79
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:30,110
in nineteen years what we have achieved.

80
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:37,350
So many yogis are sitting before me.

81
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:42,270
The difference between

82
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:47,070
a saint and a yogi is

83
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:52,790
that a saint himself is righteous,

84
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,190
himself is holy,

85
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:07,070
but he doesn't know much about the Kundalini.

86
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,790
But the yogi knows about the Kundalini.

87
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:20,270
But the difference between a yogi and a Sahaja Yogini -

88
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:25,990
Sahaja Yogi, is that a Sahaja Yogi has powers.

89
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,990
A Sahaja Yogini has powers to give realisation to others.

90
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:40,110
A yogi can cleanse himself but he cannot cleanse others,

91
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:48,430
while a Sahaja Yogi can cleanse others and cleanse himself.

92
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,910
So this is the superior most state

93
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:58,070
which you achieved through your

94
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,350
great punyas I should say.

95
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:06,670
So many of you have been searching the truth in previous lives,

96
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:13,030
and now here you are to achieve

97
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,070
what you have been searching for.

98
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,910
All that has happened now, so beautifully.

99
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,990
You are not even aware what has happened to you.

100
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,950
Automatically,

101
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,510
spontaneously you have got the powers

102
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:37,710
within your central nervous system in a split of a second.

103
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,790
Your attention has been fixed now.

104
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,670
Of course even now some people don't have.

105
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,870
Even now I see the attention wobbles.

106
00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:01,110
But so many of you have achieved that state as he was saying,

107
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:04,990
Shivo'ham, Shivo'ham, Shivo'ham. You have it.

108
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,950
What Adi Shankaracharya has described about himself,

109
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:15,270
you can say that about all of you.

110
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,230
So many Adi Shankaracharyas sitting before Me.

111
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:27,510
But still I am a Mahamaya.

112
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,190
I just behave like you,

113
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,110
I too have a family,

114
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:41,430
I too have children which can be called as mine,

115
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,990
and you are my children too.

116
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,910
So when you are mature enough

117
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:55,230
the first sign is that you get discretion.

118
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:00,750
That Divine discretion is love, again.

119
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:06,870
But I see people falter. They don't mind saying

120
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:10,390
"Mother, I am catching on my Agnya."

121
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:15,190
Why? You know how to cleanse it.

122
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,270
You know what to do about it.

123
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:22,870
Why don't you clear it? Why don't you get to it?

124
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,343
What is the thing? The Maya.

125
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:34,270
But we are Sahaja Yogis and we have our Sahaj culture.

126
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:39,430
We live with our culture, proud of it, and this is our religion.

127
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:44,270
We have our pure religion on which we thrive,

128
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:47,070
we're not going to change.

129
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,070
Ourselves we are going to change the whole world.

130
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,590
We have a culture of our own

131
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,710
and we are going to behave in that manner

132
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,390
which is going to change the whole world.

133
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,630
This is our responsibility.

134
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,350
You are chosen for this work.

135
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:09,070
You are the real chosen ones. You are the real pure ones.

136
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,790
You are the ones who have established the kalisthan.

137
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:22,270
Be aware of it, of your responsibility.

138
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,310
Be aware of your powers.

139
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:30,790
The greatest power that you have is of Divine love,

140
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,790
not the stupid love that blinds you

141
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,310
and that you fall in love, but you rise in love.

142
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,910
The way we talk, the way we walk, the way we live,

143
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,830
the way we behave.

144
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,910
Everything has to be Sahaj.

145
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:57,150
And it is such a real, living culture

146
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:02,550
of beautiful people in the world.

147
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,270
We see in the animals

148
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:13,150
in the birds; we see a swan, it's described.

149
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:18,790
among animals the elephant, which has the wisdom.

150
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:24,030
The swan that knows how to separate water from milk.

151
00:13:27,703 --> 00:13:32,383
Then among human beings, Sahaja Yogis.

152
00:13:32,783 --> 00:13:35,623
Today, in these modern times,

153
00:13:36,263 --> 00:13:40,703
I think by the time it is twenty-one years

154
00:13:42,023 --> 00:13:47,943
we will be all very well established, matured,

155
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:53,423
wonderful Sahaja Yogis,

156
00:13:53,823 --> 00:13:58,463
pulling out this mad world from it's ignorance and from it's Maya.

157
00:13:59,023 --> 00:14:01,583
We'll be that powerful people of love,

158
00:14:01,943 --> 00:14:04,703
of understanding, of discretion

159
00:14:05,543 --> 00:14:08,223
and of humility.

160
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:13,063
I would like to see those days in my lifetime.

161
00:14:13,743 --> 00:14:17,943
I hope you will give me full assistance.

162
00:14:19,381 --> 00:14:20,820
You have to know

163
00:14:21,021 --> 00:14:27,460
there's only one point was fixed in this meeting of the Devas

164
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,828
and that I cannot overcome.

165
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:36,540
They said " we'll tolerate any nonsense

166
00:14:36,741 --> 00:14:38,740
because they are coming from ignorance,

167
00:14:38,941 --> 00:14:41,701
but anybody who doesn't love You

168
00:14:41,941 --> 00:14:44,101
anybody who insults You,

169
00:14:44,381 --> 00:14:46,781
anybody who takes advantage of You

170
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:48,821
anybody who exploits You,

171
00:14:49,141 --> 00:14:53,741
anybody who shows lack of protocol,

172
00:14:55,021 --> 00:14:59,821
anybody who doesn't recognise you, we'll hit them hard,

173
00:15:00,101 --> 00:15:02,941
and that permission You must give us,

174
00:15:03,301 --> 00:15:05,101
otherwise we are not for this work".

175
00:15:05,661 --> 00:15:08,701
They formed a union against Me.

176
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:14,941
And I had to give in.

177
00:15:15,221 --> 00:15:19,021
And be very careful, I tell you, don't touch me, be careful.

178
00:15:19,381 --> 00:15:21,861
Some people just try to put my sari right.

179
00:15:22,061 --> 00:15:25,341
You're not to do that, don't have to do that.

180
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:29,861
Don't play with my money,

181
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:36,461
don't take my hospitality, be careful.

182
00:15:36,901 --> 00:15:40,421
I tell you as much as I can,

183
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,541
and this is what it is.

184
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:47,861
One side is Mahamaya, another side these deities,

185
00:15:48,101 --> 00:15:50,701
and poor Sahaja Yogis in between.

186
00:15:55,741 --> 00:15:58,901
I sympathise with you, I know

187
00:15:59,581 --> 00:16:02,301
but you better be careful.

188
00:16:02,621 --> 00:16:05,341
It's a razor's edge I think, of course,

189
00:16:05,821 --> 00:16:07,981
but otherwise it's wonderful.

190
00:16:09,741 --> 00:16:15,581
If these two things, if you know, that this is Mahamaya

191
00:16:16,461 --> 00:16:20,141
and that the deities are around sitting now here, all of them,

192
00:16:20,421 --> 00:16:24,981
peering into you, all of them,

193
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:28,181
judging you, having a big meeting there. Who's who?

194
00:16:28,661 --> 00:16:31,621
Where is the attention of this gentleman? Where is he looking?

195
00:16:32,661 --> 00:16:36,341
What is he doing? They are all sitting here.

196
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:43,541
But at the same time they are flowers, Divine flowers,

197
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:48,981
Divine blessings and all the angels are just going round,

198
00:16:49,261 --> 00:16:53,101
I can see them. Your cameras can catch them.

199
00:16:53,461 --> 00:16:56,501
You've got photographs that will show you all of them sitting.

200
00:16:57,461 --> 00:17:02,861
And it's already predicted that the whole world will

201
00:17:03,101 --> 00:17:06,021
come down at the Lotus Feet of your Mother,

202
00:17:06,301 --> 00:17:11,741
and that you will decide the future of this world.

203
00:17:12,021 --> 00:17:14,741
It is written already, fourteen-thousand years back,

204
00:17:15,061 --> 00:17:17,941
and there's another one who's prophesizing the same.

205
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,941
So you have to be aware.

206
00:17:32,941 --> 00:17:35,381
Where is your attention?

207
00:17:42,101 --> 00:17:44,541
What are you worried about?

208
00:17:44,941 --> 00:17:47,901
Where are you spending your time?

209
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,821
Leave your children to me.

210
00:17:53,221 --> 00:17:55,661
Leave your families to me.

211
00:17:56,221 --> 00:17:58,981
You can only keep your purse,

212
00:18:01,101 --> 00:18:04,021
but the rest of it,

213
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:08,661
you can leave all your headaches to Me.

214
00:18:10,301 --> 00:18:13,821
But don't play tricks with Me.

215
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:22,021
Mahamaya knows all your tricks, everything, in and out.

216
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:26,821
If I want to know, I can know each and everything about you.

217
00:18:27,381 --> 00:18:30,061
I don't want to know.

218
00:18:33,941 --> 00:18:37,301
Under these circumstances

219
00:18:39,261 --> 00:18:43,381
we are supported, looked after,

220
00:18:45,261 --> 00:18:50,101
managed, taken to reality so easily,

221
00:18:50,941 --> 00:18:54,661
so much, with care.

222
00:18:55,127 --> 00:18:57,260
You tell me "Mother, suddenly I went there

223
00:18:57,461 --> 00:19:00,101
and what do I find, Sahaja Yogis sitting there.

224
00:19:00,621 --> 00:19:03,341
And we wanted to know someone. He was just there.

225
00:19:03,701 --> 00:19:05,661
How is it?"

226
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:12,821
You are assisted.

227
00:19:13,101 --> 00:19:16,741
Here these Prime Ministers have only five, six bodyguards,

228
00:19:17,021 --> 00:19:22,141
you have millions and millions, each one of you, with you.

229
00:19:23,861 --> 00:19:28,021
Nobody can touch you except for you can harm yourself that's all.

230
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,461
Nobody can harm you.

231
00:19:31,221 --> 00:19:35,541
So today, again a day of great determination,

232
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:39,101
and taking a vow

233
00:19:39,381 --> 00:19:44,661
that for us, our ascent is the only concern,

234
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:49,587
is the only idea, nothing else,

235
00:19:50,547 --> 00:19:52,347
and it will work out.

236
00:19:52,907 --> 00:19:56,427
All the rest will be taken care of.

237
00:19:57,187 --> 00:19:59,587
You have all the mechanics to do that,

238
00:20:00,027 --> 00:20:04,707
but first give it to the mechanics to work out.

239
00:20:05,107 --> 00:20:07,747
All will work in a reflex action.

240
00:20:08,147 --> 00:20:11,267
Clear, clear out your chakras.

241
00:20:11,827 --> 00:20:14,307
Don't say "I have this, I have that." Just clear out.

242
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:17,227
"How dare I have all these problems."

243
00:20:17,827 --> 00:20:20,907
How dare I have all these chakras still lingering.

244
00:20:21,427 --> 00:20:25,947
Clear out, morning, evening. Clear out.

245
00:20:30,547 --> 00:20:32,267
I'm sure it will work out.

246
00:20:32,547 --> 00:20:37,067
Next year I hope I'll have some good news.

247
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,679
May God Bless You.
