00:48.508 --> 00:55.508
It’s very nice to see all of you here, so
many of you from Australia,

00:57.823 --> 01:00.447
to worship Shiva, Sadashiva.

01:02.236 --> 01:05.623
I think this is a very important occasion.

01:15.958 --> 01:22.296
Is important, because Sadashiva,

01:24.076 --> 01:27.602
the God Almighty, who is One,

01:29.156 --> 01:33.914
is expressed on your heart as Spirit, the Shiva.

01:40.259 --> 01:51.623
We have to understand that so many people
came on this earth at different times, in

01:51.932 --> 02:03.168
different countries, and they talked to different
people about righteousness, that is dharma,

02:06.381 --> 02:09.181
about how to elevate yourself,

02:10.020 --> 02:14.589
and all of them have said that you have to be reborn,

02:17.335 --> 02:20.400
that is, you have to become the Spirit.

02:20.786 --> 02:22.282
They have all

02:31.052 --> 02:35.111
said the same thing because they knew, without

02:38.464 --> 02:45.980
the attention is filled with the light of the Spirit,

02:47.296 --> 02:51.326
you will not be able to understand spirituality.

03:07.778 --> 03:09.978
You have the Spirit within you,

03:11.377 --> 03:14.994
which is all the time in a witness state.

03:16.541 --> 03:19.070
Why all the religions have failed?

03:19.887 --> 03:24.501
Because they did not get their Self-Realization.

03:26.103 --> 03:28.614
They did not become the Spirit.

03:31.936 --> 03:36.760
So there's a tremendous difference between you and all others

03:36.935 --> 03:41.226
who profess something. It looks as if they are hypocrites.

03:42.683 --> 03:48.506
They intellectualize it as you know, they explain it very well,

03:49.767 --> 03:54.858
but you can see very clearly
that they haven't absorbed spirituality.

03:58.104 --> 04:04.225
That absorption was impossible without Self-Realization.

04:06.607 --> 04:08.829
This everybody felt.

04:09.416 --> 04:13.815
Buddha went to this limit and Mahavira both, to say that,

04:14.064 --> 04:16.241
forget about God,

04:16.570 --> 04:18.846
forget about God Almighty,

04:19.992 --> 04:23.483
you just get your Self, your Self-Realization.

04:24.624 --> 04:27.605
So they are called as atheist in Idikshavadi,

04:27.755 --> 04:30.045
they don't believe in Ishwara,

04:31.155 --> 04:36.651
but they felt that the way
people are just talking about God Almighty

04:36.853 --> 04:39.496
and what the books have said.

04:40.584 --> 04:46.743
These books also speak of righteousness,

04:47.015 --> 04:52.230
except in some books there has been some sort of interference,

04:52.694 --> 04:57.724
but most of them speak of spirituality

04:58.121 --> 05:00.854
and what you have to achieve,

05:01.968 --> 05:05.581
what is the purpose of religion.

05:10.098 --> 05:15.330
All that is spoken very well, written very well.

05:16.622 --> 05:20.483
They'll tell you, “You have to be this, you have to be that,

05:20.752 --> 05:23.496
this is not good, that is not good.”

05:24.051 --> 05:28.919
So even the first state, where the dharma has to be established,

05:29.501 --> 05:38.106
was not established:
where people are not supposed to cheat each other,

05:39.394 --> 05:45.151
there has to be justice, there has to be collectivity,

05:46.387 --> 05:52.605
there has to be love and understanding, no jealousies,

05:53.321 --> 06:00.321
no hypocrisy; where it's a different race,

06:00.485 --> 06:02.018
a different community,

06:02.331 --> 06:06.568
we can call it a different civilization is to be created.

06:08.542 --> 06:12.208
Everybody claims that they are the chosen ones,

06:12.913 --> 06:15.217
but they are just the same.

06:16.352 --> 06:21.122
There's a tremendous achievement of Sahaja Yogis

06:21.722 --> 06:25.302
that they have achieved this state of Spirit.

06:26.186 --> 06:30.812
So now you can absorb dharma without any difficulties,

06:31.152 --> 06:36.172
without any difficulties. You would not like to cheat anyone,

06:36.558 --> 06:38.558
you'd not like to kill anyone,

06:38.985 --> 06:42.146
you'd not like to be violent with anyone.

06:42.747 --> 06:47.259
You will stick on to the truth, the truth,

06:47.797 --> 06:51.275
very few people can stick on to the truth.

06:53.554 --> 06:58.687
Then you are not people who are going to rob others,

07:00.036 --> 07:06.123
you have no intention at all, doesn't come into your mind

07:06.373 --> 07:10.361
that you are tempted to take away things from others.

07:13.146 --> 07:16.624
First of all, which is the most important thing,

07:16.807 --> 07:20.832
that you have a rapport with God Almighty;

07:23.315 --> 07:28.720
that you are, in a way, in awe about God.

07:29.564 --> 07:34.357
There is awe, not I would say fear,

07:34.777 --> 07:38.733
because fear is all dispelled, there's no more fear for you,

07:40.547 --> 07:45.099
but you have awe for God, that He is God Almighty.

07:47.080 --> 07:53.165
You won't cheat people, you won't cheat Sahaja Yoga for money,

07:54.606 --> 08:05.170
you won't fight for power or for something that is material.

08:06.928 --> 08:09.896
All your attention will be towards

08:10.294 --> 08:14.917
the expansion of your awareness in the light of the Spirit.

08:15.742 --> 08:19.282
This is the vision of your Mother,

08:20.382 --> 08:23.782
because Shiva is just a witness,

08:24.202 --> 08:27.363
Sadashiva is just witnessing all this play.

08:27.703 --> 08:31.570
He doesn't have any visions about it,

08:31.781 --> 08:35.474
but now He must have lots of hopes after seeing

08:36.234 --> 08:40.234
the kind of people that are created out of Sahaja Yoga.

08:40.786 --> 08:47.031
Very unique, very beautiful,
wonderful angel-like people have been created.

08:48.026 --> 08:54.146
Now only problem is that
you have to keep to your angelic foundations;

08:55.450 --> 09:00.765
but I find that sometimes it happens, doesn't matter,

09:01.632 --> 09:04.541
that you fall, and falter.

09:05.437 --> 09:14.448
Again, you rise into your awareness and try to locate

09:19.585 --> 09:26.302
the new dimensions that are available to you,
that you can find out.

09:27.733 --> 09:34.733
All this is possible because now
you belong really to the chosen ones’ race.

09:35.363 --> 09:39.532
You must know also that you are very special people.

09:40.269 --> 09:43.829
It is not realized sometimes by Sahaja Yogis.

09:45.408 --> 09:49.770
They have no self-esteem as to what they have got.

09:51.483 --> 09:53.852
Once you have self-esteem,

09:54.241 --> 10:01.241
you will have the wisdom to understand
what is your role in this lifetime.

10:05.062 --> 10:07.969
This self-esteem is only possible

10:08.242 --> 10:15.121
if you see other people who are lost in the mire of nonsense.

10:17.242 --> 10:20.233
Now you are a special community I said,

10:20.415 --> 10:26.695
you are the one who are going to create that great community.

10:31.590 --> 10:39.284
Now whatever are the dharma’s

10:41.484 --> 10:45.801
points, or we can say dharma’s aspects,

10:46.766 --> 10:52.727
you can imbibe them Sahaj. “Sahaj” has a very special meaning:

10:52.887 --> 10:56.503
Spontaneously, you do not have to exert,

10:57.986 --> 11:04.986
you do not have to go into a penance or work it out.

11:06.601 --> 11:11.972
In a Sahaj way you can do it. “Sahaj” also means easy.

11:12.948 --> 11:17.060
You can have it in your heart, all these qualities,

11:17.323 --> 11:20.155
without any difficulty whatsoever.

11:21.198 --> 11:27.272
It's the easiest thing for you
to be righteous than to be otherwise.

11:27.749 --> 11:32.111
It's easier for you to be honest than to be otherwise.

11:33.568 --> 11:43.350
So this speciality that you have got
is the vision of all the saints, of all the prophets,

11:43.585 --> 11:49.063
of all the seers, of all the Incarnations,

11:52.091 --> 11:56.524
There are lectures and lectures people give,
“You must do like this, you must do that way.”

11:57.624 --> 12:03.811
They think that by educating people into
these principles people will be all right, they cannot.

12:05.995 --> 12:10.652
If you try to educate them, it will go as an ego into their heads,

12:10.822 --> 12:14.727
because you get educated only through your ego.

12:15.945 --> 12:21.614
Is not Sahaj, is not Sahaj sustenance, Sahaja dharana,

12:21.796 --> 12:26.340
it is something that is put

12:26.608 --> 12:28.737
onto you from outside,

12:29.950 --> 12:36.954
but for you it is very easy, that you can imbibe

12:37.365 --> 12:40.923
all the aspects of dharma very easily.

12:41.229 --> 12:44.235
You don't have to do anything, you will not just do it.

12:44.643 --> 12:48.184
I've known people who used to take drugs,

12:48.910 --> 12:54.780
who used to abuse people, beat. There's one fellow,
he said he used to carry a revolver always with him.

12:55.041 --> 13:00.152
He's become such a quiet, silent, beautiful person

13:00.503 --> 13:05.061
that unbelievable, but his wife tells Me that he was like this.

13:05.508 --> 13:08.461
So now you are that special people,

13:09.312 --> 13:14.992
and those people who have not got their Realization

13:16.677 --> 13:19.775
cannot get to dharma easily.

13:22.769 --> 13:28.526
Then the second point which is very easy for you

13:29.172 --> 13:36.172
is to love another person, to care for another person.

13:38.626 --> 13:42.232
Is very easy, you would love to do that.

13:43.902 --> 13:51.357
You would love to care for people who are Sahaja Yogis,

13:52.140 --> 13:54.611
also who are non-SahajaYogis.

13:55.018 --> 13:57.311
Sahaja Yoga is quite flexible.

13:57.753 --> 14:01.979
If you see somebody who is a non-SahajaYogi

14:02.426 --> 14:06.595
and also suffering, you would immediately jump

14:08.342 --> 14:12.296
to see that that person gets help from you.

14:13.243 --> 14:18.490
I have seen people in Sahaja Yoga, very interesting they are.

14:21.223 --> 14:27.660
One gentleman came to Me and said,
“Mother I have no money, I want to go

14:28.684 --> 14:31.375
and do some work for Sahaja Yoga

14:31.506 --> 14:35.857
but I have no money, even I have no money for the household.”

14:36.016 --> 14:40.687
I said, “All right, that's very good, you come tomorrow,
I'll give you the money.”

14:41.209 --> 14:45.515
Next day he never came. I said, “What's the matter?”

14:46.900 --> 14:51.626
He said, “There was somebody
sitting with You that time when I was talking with You,

14:51.753 --> 14:54.921
if You remember.”
I said, “I don't remember so clearly.”

14:55.064 --> 14:57.612
“All right, I also don't know him,

14:57.760 --> 15:01.736
as soon as I went out he said, ‘How much money do you want?’

15:01.877 --> 15:03.913
I told him, ‘At least this much.’

15:04.060 --> 15:07.530
Immediately he took out the money and gave it to me.”

15:07.748 --> 15:13.011
So who haven't got something in Sahaja Yoga, who hasn't got money,

15:13.799 --> 15:16.914
immediately we run to help that person.

15:17.164 --> 15:22.343
Like you'll be amazed that there are these six countries like

15:22.463 --> 15:28.254
Romania, Bulgaria, Russia, Poland,

15:32.461 --> 15:44.168
Czechoslovakia, all these countries, even Hungary, have been helped

15:45.875 --> 15:48.527
by one country or other,

15:49.604 --> 15:53.338
even the East Asian countries are helped by Australians.

15:53.728 --> 15:56.673
I never told them, I never asked them,

15:56.968 --> 15:59.402
I never said that, “You have to help.”

15:59.552 --> 16:03.927
They just came forward that
“Mother, somehow we have to help them,

16:04.256 --> 16:10.534
we'll arrange, we'll get to them,
we'll manage this, we'll do that.” It's very surprising,

16:11.238 --> 16:17.085
how they could just think of helping those countries.

16:18.152 --> 16:23.027
Then they made tickets for them,

16:23.512 --> 16:26.956
they brought them to India. They looked after,

16:27.150 --> 16:31.049
Russians came to India, were looked after.

16:31.306 --> 16:34.285
Everybody was so full of compassion and love

16:34.410 --> 16:37.074
but without feeling they have done anything, without feeling

16:37.210 --> 16:40.234
in any way that they have done any obligation to someone.

16:40.391 --> 16:45.479
Nobody expected them to thank them
and write letters of thanks or anything.

16:46.897 --> 16:49.764
Whatever is done is finished now, that's...

16:51.081 --> 16:56.067
Nobody ever asked how much money was given,

16:56.235 --> 17:00.722
how much was spent, how much we had to give, nothing of the kind.

17:00.960 --> 17:04.951
At that spur of the moment everybody
come forward, they gave the money

17:05.115 --> 17:09.001
and the thing worked out. It was very surprising.

17:11.666 --> 17:15.892
For example France, France is looking after Romania.

17:16.372 --> 17:19.957
I didn't know they had done so much of work in Romania.

17:20.096 --> 17:26.068
I reached Hungary and suddenly
I find hundred-and-twenty-five Romanians there.

17:26.261 --> 17:30.705
My heart was really filled with such joy.
I said, “How are you here?”

17:30.857 --> 17:35.435
“French have arranged everything for us, Mother.”
“Really?”

17:35.726 --> 17:39.517
There were no French people there, no-one from France.

17:39.665 --> 17:42.455
And Romanians were singing so well

17:42.732 --> 17:46.808
that the Indians felt that,
“Oh wah, what is this, a new group has started?”

17:46.923 --> 17:49.849
All of them, and they never used books, without

17:49.963 --> 17:52.548
using the books they were singing, these Romanians.

17:52.683 --> 17:55.222
So I said, “Where are you going to stay in the night?”

17:55.358 --> 17:57.626
“We'll stay in a garden Mother, it's all right.”

17:57.732 --> 18:01.798
But I said, “How?” “We'll stay there, doesn't matter.”

18:02.206 --> 18:04.267
How secretly they helped.

18:04.392 --> 18:09.789
If I had not asked them, I would not have known how they have come.

18:11.356 --> 18:14.477
So this, to help the people who do not have,

18:14.591 --> 18:18.502
you can call them sort of a,
you can say those who are poorer than us.

18:21.664 --> 18:28.855
I have seen also people, how individually they look after others,

18:30.642 --> 18:36.574
and bring things for their friends, presents

18:39.046 --> 18:43.663
and beautiful things, just for their own satisfaction,

18:44.551 --> 18:47.227
not to oblige anyone or to

18:47.615 --> 18:50.526
later on say, “Oh I brought this sari for you.” Nothing,

18:50.675 --> 18:53.741
just to see that sari on another Sahaja Yogi.

18:55.883 --> 18:57.952
It's such a beautiful thing.

18:58.666 --> 19:03.519
Imagine these countries like England, France, Spain,

19:06.822 --> 19:13.065
Italy, Switzerland, very aggressive, very aggressive people.

19:13.738 --> 19:16.959
When they went out, not to help anyone

19:17.787 --> 19:20.417
but to establish their empire

19:21.038 --> 19:28.038
or to destroy people, or to convert them or do
all kinds of things in the name of religion, in the name of God.

19:29.661 --> 19:34.006
But, when you go to other countries, you just want to help,

19:35.559 --> 19:38.391
give them all the help that is needed.

19:38.785 --> 19:44.148
I am Myself amazed how it works out so spontaneous in your heart

19:44.266 --> 19:48.012
that you should do this and you should work it out.

19:52.195 --> 19:56.029
This transformation that has taken place within you

19:56.351 --> 20:02.223
has brought out all the beauty of your heart,
of your compassion, of your love.

20:02.613 --> 20:05.635
And you give, want to give security to others,

20:05.818 --> 20:10.058
without expecting anything, without demanding anything.

20:10.943 --> 20:13.491
And you all enjoy it, doing that,

20:14.739 --> 20:17.072
living in a simple place like this,

20:17.976 --> 20:21.606
under a tent, sitting, listening to Me,

20:22.072 --> 20:27.922
you don't want any comfort, just seek the comfort of your Spirit

20:28.246 --> 20:31.405
and enjoy the whole place, the Nature.

20:32.698 --> 20:36.596
Gradually I have seen also Sahaja Yogis are becoming

20:36.893 --> 20:42.208
extremely conscious of the ecological problem all over the world.

20:44.393 --> 20:48.192
They have started using things which are natural,

20:48.328 --> 20:52.584
which are artistic. It's something so surprising

20:52.760 --> 20:56.402
that suddenly they have taken to artistic things.

20:57.389 --> 20:59.287
I know of a gentleman

21:01.829 --> 21:06.418
who had arms, ammunitions in his house, everything like that,

21:07.382 --> 21:10.432
but now he has beautiful things.

21:11.524 --> 21:15.059
Of course the arms and ammunition are on one side

21:15.161 --> 21:18.695
but such beautiful artistic things he has collected.

21:19.242 --> 21:21.648
So I said, “How did you get this?”

21:21.800 --> 21:23.509
He said, “Mother I was thinking

21:23.612 --> 21:26.251
that You would like to see them and You'll feel happy,

21:26.342 --> 21:29.029
so I have bought for You to see,

21:29.288 --> 21:33.360
and if You want You can take anything.”
I said, “I don't want anything,

21:33.474 --> 21:35.407
you can keep it to yourself.”

21:36.531 --> 21:40.001
So this generosity, we’ll call it adhari,

21:41.339 --> 21:43.491
is a sign of an Incarnation.

21:43.918 --> 21:47.856
But this generosity is among My own children now.

21:48.297 --> 21:50.573
They’re extremely generous,

21:50.789 --> 21:56.988
and they enjoy giving things to other,
than to in keeping things to themselves.

21:57.467 --> 22:00.379
It has happened not only in Australia,

22:00.527 --> 22:02.860
it has happened all over the world.

22:03.111 --> 22:11.147
If you see the Sahaja Yogis, how they are sacrificing

22:11.489 --> 22:14.426
their time, their money and everything

22:14.801 --> 22:18.440
to spread Sahaja Yoga, to help others,

22:18.820 --> 22:22.003
and to accommodate all kinds of things,

22:23.478 --> 22:26.402
all kinds of people within themselves.

22:27.348 --> 22:33.815
Such wisdom, such collective wisdom is there.

22:34.530 --> 22:37.530
We don't have to take any consensus.

22:37.805 --> 22:41.889
We don't have to say that “You all must say this” or

22:42.075 --> 22:45.053
“What is your opinion? Will you vote for it?”

22:45.178 --> 22:47.491
Everyone votes for the same.

22:47.741 --> 22:52.126
If somebody says, “All right, we have to give some

22:52.562 --> 22:57.707
help to, say, Bulgaria”, in Italy,

22:58.353 --> 23:03.403
immediately all the Italians
brought out their ornaments, everything there.

23:03.539 --> 23:07.969
“Mother, how much should wesend?” I said,” It's your lookout.”

23:08.058 --> 23:10.794
And the Bulgarians are surprised also

23:11.632 --> 23:14.410
that, “What have we done for these Italians

23:14.557 --> 23:17.075
that they should come down all the way to

23:17.178 --> 23:20.601
help us out with money, every kind of thing?”

23:22.829 --> 23:26.806
So this compassion, this love,

23:27.115 --> 23:31.398
this feeling of oneness, as if they are part and parcel of us,

23:31.614 --> 23:37.303
we are not separate. For Russia, you'll be surprised

23:38.243 --> 23:43.277
that they sent a television from America.

23:44.235 --> 23:47.590
Now America had nothing to do with Russia,

23:48.142 --> 23:51.060
but must be the Spirit of Shri Krishna

23:51.559 --> 23:59.218
trying to help the Spirit of right Agnya, must be.

24:00.351 --> 24:04.211
Such enthusiasm about Russia,

24:06.159 --> 24:08.562
it's unbelievable.

24:08.755 --> 24:13.324
They came in the buses, they came in the trains,
they went all the way

24:13.449 --> 24:16.691
to all these places, to far-fetched places,

24:20.394 --> 24:23.686
and they've achieved tremendous results.

24:25.546 --> 24:29.768
It's not only in Europe they're working it out

24:30.187 --> 24:32.733
around their own cities,

24:33.369 --> 24:37.416
but all the way they are working in Turkey,

24:38.865 --> 24:44.980
they are working in Nepal, and now somebody has gone to Japan.

24:45.876 --> 24:49.561
He is actually not a Japanese,

24:54.051 --> 24:55.661
he is from Rio

24:57.719 --> 25:01.578
and he has gone to Japan, is a physicist,

25:02.667 --> 25:06.351
but he is using some sort of a pantomime show

25:06.578 --> 25:11.705
on the streets to attract
the people and telling them about Sahaja Yoga.

25:12.069 --> 25:16.502
He telephoned to Me three, four times,
“Mother, You have beento Australia so many times.

25:16.786 --> 25:18.929
Why don't You come to Japan this time?”

25:19.043 --> 25:22.665
I said, ”All right, next time I will definitely come to

25:22.789 --> 25:24.296
Japan,” I promised him,

25:24.423 --> 25:28.156
“but this time I'm already programmed you see, by Sahaja Yogis,

25:29.037 --> 25:33.731
so I can't help it. They have fixed Me up everywhere”;

25:34.283 --> 25:37.285
and I don't mind because it’s so Sahaj,

25:37.451 --> 25:39.190
to Me it comes Sahaj.

25:39.305 --> 25:42.525
Many people ask Me, “Mother, You are traveling so much,” they say.

25:42.672 --> 25:44.206
I never think about it.

25:47.764 --> 25:55.341
Also, the collectivity you have now is tremendous.

25:55.840 --> 25:59.374
It's not only in Australia you have the collectivity,

26:00.792 --> 26:06.027
but the other day I telephoned to someone in India and told them,

26:06.233 --> 26:08.441
“I'm buying an ashram in Brisbane.”

26:08.579 --> 26:11.945
They said, “ Mother it's a very great thing. We are very happy.”

26:12.113 --> 26:13.748
Now for an Indian,

26:14.859 --> 26:18.793
what is there to be happy if we buy an ashram in Brisbane?

26:21.315 --> 26:23.051
So overjoyed about it.

26:23.324 --> 26:27.450
To them Brisbane is the same as Bombay or Delhi.

26:32.808 --> 26:35.356
The Heart has become so large,

26:35.844 --> 26:39.257
because Shiva is shining there, the Spirit is shining.

26:39.450 --> 26:41.847
It has become such a large Heart

26:42.014 --> 26:47.185
that it encompasses the whole universe,
I think, the way people look at it,

26:47.299 --> 26:51.811
that's why you all have become universal people.

26:52.526 --> 26:58.732
You don't only read about Vishwa Nirmala Dharma,

26:59.090 --> 27:03.899
you don't only knowabout it through your mind,

27:04.325 --> 27:09.392
you don't only try to follow it,
but you have imbibed it within yourself,

27:10.232 --> 27:13.565
which is so Sahaj, which you are not aware of it,

27:13.761 --> 27:16.890
how in a Sahaj way it has come to you.

27:18.100 --> 27:22.151
Now you know Australia was full of racialism once upon a time,

27:22.360 --> 27:25.797
nobody was come, allowed to come in here,

27:26.523 --> 27:31.432
might be fifty years back or so, but today in Australia

27:32.079 --> 27:33.705
what a change it is!

27:35.089 --> 27:39.156
Though they talked of Christianity and all those things, but

27:40.373 --> 27:43.333
they didn’t think what Christ has said,

27:43.855 --> 27:47.855
they were just the opposite of what Christianity should be.

27:50.782 --> 27:54.516
Islam is the same, Islam talks of very great things,

27:56.147 --> 28:01.912
but it has to be confessed that
the Muslims have nothing to do with Islam.

28:03.046 --> 28:06.773
Is absolutely from outside, if you see Christianity

28:08.723 --> 28:11.919
you have a very, very funny idea about it.

28:12.124 --> 28:16.106
If you ask any Hindu gentleman about Christianity

28:17.932 --> 28:21.198
they will say they are the worst possible people,

28:22.387 --> 28:28.919
very cunning, very aggressive
and it takes them no time to kill each other.

28:30.852 --> 28:38.855
Imagine, disciples of Christ;
but if you ask a Christian about a Muslim

28:39.116 --> 28:45.570
he will tell you, “Oh, these Muslims
are the most quarrelsome, dirtiest people ever born,

28:46.114 --> 28:49.176
fundamentalist.” They are all fundamentalist,

28:49.313 --> 28:54.780
whether it's a Hindu, Christian, Muslim, anyone,
they're fundamentalist because

28:55.526 --> 28:57.259
they are reading one book

28:58.496 --> 29:00.602
and that too, just reading.

29:00.762 --> 29:03.960
The book also doesn't go, if the book goes inside

29:04.041 --> 29:06.474
they will realize that all these books

29:06.633 --> 29:10.699
are telling the same thing under different names, that's all.

29:11.040 --> 29:13.895
But that universal thing you have got,

29:14.031 --> 29:18.122
thanks to your Spirit, that was there quite intact

29:18.303 --> 29:21.037
and which has started shining within you.

29:22.065 --> 29:27.019
So we have now a new community, a new civilization

29:27.201 --> 29:35.166
of people who are extremely honest with themselves,
honest to each other.

29:36.969 --> 29:40.431
They are extremely righteous and good people,

29:41.225 --> 29:43.867
they are absolutely non-violent,

29:44.341 --> 29:51.341
absolutely law-abiding, very loving, affectionate,

29:51.758 --> 29:54.809
at the same time extremely constructive,

29:57.698 --> 30:03.457
and at the same time very intelligent.

30:05.339 --> 30:09.180
They understand Sahaja Yoga, it's such a subtle subject.

30:09.396 --> 30:11.929
Sahaja Yoga is such a subtle subject,

30:12.038 --> 30:17.027
because you know everybody has failed to make people understand

30:17.515 --> 30:19.176
anything about truth.

30:19.560 --> 30:26.017
It’s an impossible situation. But this was the trick, your Spirit.

30:27.446 --> 30:31.686
Once your Spirit is enlightened it goes into your head

30:34.120 --> 30:37.281
without any difficulties, absolutely Sahaj.

30:38.052 --> 30:42.777
You don't know how difficult is this subject of Sahaja Yoga.

30:47.754 --> 30:52.051
It is such a fulfillment

30:56.218 --> 30:58.389
for the desire of the Divine

30:59.716 --> 31:03.219
that your  Divinity is now expressing itself.

31:05.192 --> 31:10.163
When you are collective, you are more enjoying each other,

31:10.447 --> 31:18.869
you enjoy collective life. Individualism is against

31:19.266 --> 31:21.376
the spirit of the whole,

31:25.561 --> 31:29.426
but we have our own varieties.

31:30.144 --> 31:35.335
The way you live in other countries, in other atmospheres,

31:35.551 --> 31:40.652
with other traditions, that's how you are living.

31:45.156 --> 31:52.267
But among ourselves we have the same faith,

31:53.922 --> 31:58.011
the faith which is enlightened, which is not blind faith,

31:58.285 --> 32:03.670
enlightened faith, firstly that you are realized souls,

32:04.063 --> 32:07.796
secondly that there is an all-pervading Power.

32:08.760 --> 32:14.357
We have the same type of worship, whether it is Christ,

32:14.550 --> 32:18.663
whether it is Mohammed Sahib or whether it is Shiva.

32:20.472 --> 32:25.462
We all worship it the same way, we do not have a sort of a

32:27.379 --> 32:29.445
difference of opinion on that,

32:31.562 --> 32:34.096
like one church becoming ten churches

32:35.230 --> 32:39.628
and one Hinduism becoming ten Hinduisms. It's not like that.

32:40.909 --> 32:47.492
We are all Sahaja Yogis and we have all got the same principle

32:48.059 --> 32:50.871
binding us in a Sahaj manner.

32:51.800 --> 32:55.686
We don't have to say, “Oh we have to be principled,

32:55.936 --> 32:59.603
we have to be on this principle, we are Sahaja Yogis.”

33:00.544 --> 33:05.817
You have to be there, absolutely, because you have to be there.

33:07.541 --> 33:09.443
You just can't help it,

33:10.237 --> 33:15.406
because in your nature now the Spirit is shining.

33:19.510 --> 33:23.207
Also, you are becoming archetypes,

33:23.332 --> 33:26.265
I should say, in the real sense of the word,

33:26.621 --> 33:29.807
for the people who are not in Sahaj.

33:32.359 --> 33:38.111
Such people are not available anywhere.

33:39.042 --> 33:45.218
When people will see you they will think that what a model it is,
what a model of life.

33:45.434 --> 33:48.153
They don't drink, they don't smoke,

33:48.278 --> 33:51.132
they don't boast of it, they don't hate anyone,

33:51.235 --> 33:56.869
they love anyone, they are so dynamic, they are so creative,

33:57.412 --> 34:02.690
they are so constructive, they are so self-contented.

34:04.107 --> 34:06.717
They are not at all competitive,

34:07.772 --> 34:13.463
they cause no problem to Nature, they cause no problem to anything.

34:17.516 --> 34:20.182
They have become such beautiful people.

34:20.520 --> 34:22.399
Who are these people?

34:23.404 --> 34:27.472
Such beautiful people are the models. So now,

34:27.756 --> 34:30.889
individually you have to understand this part,

34:31.033 --> 34:36.350
that we have to be models in this country of Australia.

34:37.751 --> 34:47.976
Model of good behavior, good language, decent life,

34:48.384 --> 34:53.200
decorous life, not fighting with husband,

34:53.315 --> 34:56.173
fighting with wife, you see you open any television,

34:56.275 --> 34:58.407
just get a headache, I mean there's, there's no other

34:58.486 --> 35:03.275
thing but a husband fighting wife and a wife fighting husband.

35:05.374 --> 35:08.021
There should be wisdom about it.

35:09.665 --> 35:13.999
Fighting among yourselves, you see if so many people have gather

35:14.246 --> 35:18.182
in a pub what will happen that pub will burst out.

35:20.631 --> 35:22.832
They can never sit silently.

35:25.417 --> 35:29.156
The mayor of Cabella told Me, “It surprises me

35:29.700 --> 35:34.047
that in the church we are sitting for half an hour then we start

35:34.309 --> 35:39.109
nudging each other. ‘How long
is it going to take now? Better get out.’

35:39.669 --> 35:44.669
You get tired; and what are
these people doing for hours together with You?

35:45.005 --> 35:49.021
How are they so spellbound? They don't feel tired.

35:51.149 --> 35:55.920
I think they are special people.” I said, “They are, they are.”

35:59.435 --> 36:03.242
“But what do they do?” “They don't do anything,

36:03.808 --> 36:09.120
they are just enjoying.” He couldn't understand that

36:09.280 --> 36:13.809
once we had a Puja, Guru Puja, for about six hours altogether,

36:14.015 --> 36:17.721
and they were surprised that how these people are sitting;

36:17.868 --> 36:22.967
and all the people they were,
all the villagers, mostly they are elderly,

36:23.181 --> 36:26.771
they thought that these angels have come from somewhere,

36:26.930 --> 36:30.263
they are angelic people: they don't trouble you,

36:30.462 --> 36:33.566
they don't torture you, they look after you,

36:33.748 --> 36:40.561
they try to be kind to you, not only that but they try to

36:41.253 --> 36:49.657
bring joy to you. They were so surprised in that village.

36:50.534 --> 36:53.291
First they used to call Me “Princess”.

36:53.426 --> 36:56.072
Then they started calling Me “Goddess”,

36:56.197 --> 36:57.954
then they said,” You are Madonna.”

36:58.071 --> 37:01.912
Whatever they could think of the best, they started

37:02.491 --> 37:08.655
saying all those things. They want now to come to Sahaja Yoga,

37:10.174 --> 37:14.528
but I said, “Let us see now.”
After some time, we'll work it out for them also.

37:16.581 --> 37:19.075
They are so nice now by seeing

37:19.303 --> 37:22.703
how the Sahaja Yogis are, because I seldom go out;

37:22.885 --> 37:25.642
but seeing the way Sahaja Yogis are,

37:25.835 --> 37:28.952
that the land behind the house

37:29.281 --> 37:33.250
was not even given to Prince Dorio
who was willing to pay lot of money,

37:33.374 --> 37:35.737
because he wanted to have a road that way;

37:35.839 --> 37:39.413
but to Me they rushed forward

37:41.215 --> 37:45.192
and at a very nominal price they gave Me that land.

37:45.320 --> 37:48.639
They said, “It is for You only, please have it.”

37:50.216 --> 37:53.839
The whole village is getting into transformation.

37:57.955 --> 38:02.002
But the dedication you have is very remarkable,

38:03.658 --> 38:06.467
surprises Me, really surprises Me.

38:08.077 --> 38:10.388
I have never taught you much,

38:11.375 --> 38:14.375
but the way you are dedicated in everything!

38:18.744 --> 38:23.447
Everyone who is not a Sahaja Yogi

38:24.286 --> 38:31.876
will be charmed the way you are dedicated to Sahaja Yoga, to Me.

38:33.145 --> 38:37.653
Sometimes I think, “What have I done? I have done nothing.”

38:37.982 --> 38:42.993
You had your Kundalini, you had your Spirit, that's all,

38:44.898 --> 38:52.312
but such a difference, with little distance you covered,

38:52.924 --> 38:54.965
and such a difference!

38:55.849 --> 39:00.105
Can you imagine an Indian woman coming to Australia,

39:00.661 --> 39:06.302
finding this love, this affection and this dedication?
Unbelievable!

39:10.781 --> 39:14.236
They all think that I must be mesmerizing you.

39:14.837 --> 39:18.515
Nobody can believe that you could be that dedicated,

39:18.651 --> 39:21.347
take so much trouble, so much care;

39:21.563 --> 39:24.304
I mean just imagine the flowers that you have brought,

39:24.423 --> 39:26.549
just imagine all this you have done,

39:26.628 --> 39:29.222
I mean just imagine the way they brought another

39:29.313 --> 39:33.723
big car so that your Mother should be
brought here without any difficulty.

39:33.860 --> 39:35.095
All this love,

39:37.125 --> 39:43.041
all this affection, this care, I never asked for anything.

39:43.324 --> 39:45.180
I could have walked down,

39:45.274 --> 39:49.103
if you had said we have to walk,
I would have walked, I would never have said no.

39:49.240 --> 39:51.695
I never expected all this thing.

39:52.682 --> 39:56.253
But the way you want to express your love to Me,

39:56.356 --> 40:03.589
this dedication is so much and you sacrifice so much for that.

40:04.667 --> 40:07.529
Really you are sacrificing quite a lot,

40:10.273 --> 40:17.268
your time, your effort, to come
all the way to this far-off place for this Puja.

40:19.954 --> 40:23.841
All the gain that you have from Puja is only possible

40:24.113 --> 40:28.602
when you are a realized soul, otherwise it is useless

40:29.601 --> 40:34.215
to do any Puja, any worship. People go to church,

40:34.737 --> 40:37.202
sing few hymns and come back.

40:37.293 --> 40:40.827
They are just the same and afterwards go to the pub,

40:41.160 --> 40:45.960
because they think pub is the only place
where they can get some joy.

40:46.637 --> 40:51.606
One has to exert, one has to sacrifice,

40:51.911 --> 40:54.414
though I may say that Sahaja Yoga is the easiest thing.

40:54.518 --> 40:58.486
You don't have to go to
Himalayas to stand on your heads and all that,

40:58.577 --> 41:04.779
but still you have to sacrifice your time, your attention.

41:05.906 --> 41:10.859
Formerly you might be going to some rock music,

41:12.140 --> 41:15.238
you might be going to some pubs also,

41:15.418 --> 41:18.977
you might be enjoying all these things;
but you have given up everything,

41:19.115 --> 41:21.982
without My telling you, just have given up

41:22.063 --> 41:24.132
and you are so pure now.

41:24.903 --> 41:28.903
Your attention is so pure you can't enjoy all these things.

41:30.481 --> 41:34.548
Don't you think it's very remarkable that this has happened?

41:35.723 --> 41:39.317
This community, I don't have to tell you,

41:40.122 --> 41:44.054
I don't have to educate, I must say

41:44.213 --> 41:46.946
that all these things you have given up.

41:47.444 --> 41:51.841
Suddenly I find all of you have become so clean,

41:52.103 --> 41:54.982
so beautiful, your chakras so clean.

41:57.590 --> 42:03.555
Is it that these are your purva punyas that is working out?

42:05.211 --> 42:09.062
But still I would say you must know your self-esteem,

42:09.165 --> 42:13.165
that you are Sahaja Yogis, and how can you behave like this

42:13.269 --> 42:18.539
if you are a Sahaja Yogi? You cannot. Now you are a Sahaja Yogi,

42:19.027 --> 42:23.947
so that dignity, that wisdom has to be there;

42:26.300 --> 42:32.420
the compassion, the love, the unity of purpose should be there.

42:34.154 --> 42:37.650
All over the world you have brothers and sisters,

42:37.766 --> 42:42.312
this brotherhood and sisterhood is everywhere.

42:42.562 --> 42:46.901
You have rakhi sisters, you have very pure relationships.

42:47.820 --> 42:51.742
Anything impure is just thrown out in a Sahaj manner.

42:52.536 --> 42:56.435
Those who do not fit into it just get out of it.

42:59.769 --> 43:05.310
We have now very beautiful families, very beautiful children,

43:06.274 --> 43:12.742
it's, just think of it.
Moses saved some Jews but what are they good for, nothing,

43:14.455 --> 43:17.571
what's the use of saving such people?

43:18.399 --> 43:24.124
Then Christ came and talked about this thing,

43:24.480 --> 43:29.731
and this is what has happened to Christianity.

43:30.412 --> 43:34.896
Mohammed came and talked of very nice things, I must tell you.

43:35.024 --> 43:38.026
He never made it a rigid religion, never.

43:38.243 --> 43:42.074
It was very flexible, and He said, “You must get the knowledge.”

43:42.188 --> 43:44.963
So according to them, knowledge was to read the book

43:45.080 --> 43:48.354
and to interpret it and to be an intellectual.

43:52.821 --> 43:56.470
After that came Guru Nanaka also, you know that.

43:56.709 --> 43:59.924
What has happened to Sikhs, where they have gone?

44:00.049 --> 44:02.716
“Sikh” means the person who has learnt,

44:03.115 --> 44:05.244
learnt the Divine laws.

44:06.333 --> 44:10.723
If I say you have to follow the Divine laws, how?
You are not connected,

44:10.972 --> 44:13.727
you don't know what are the Divine laws are.

44:13.852 --> 44:16.919
Just follow: “We want to follow Divine laws.”

44:17.503 --> 44:20.437
Now you are hanging somewhere on this earth,

44:20.591 --> 44:23.134
the Divine laws are working there,

44:23.282 --> 44:25.717
how are you going to work out the Divine laws

44:25.813 --> 44:27.546
if you are not connected?

44:28.023 --> 44:31.423
But you know immediately what are the Divine laws;

44:31.562 --> 44:34.432
you are going against it, as soon as you go against it

44:34.523 --> 44:38.323
you know you can feel it on your central nervous system.

44:38.502 --> 44:44.509
You can feel it on your hands,
that you are doing something against the Divine laws.

44:45.472 --> 44:48.667
Immediately you know and if you are alert

44:48.759 --> 44:52.727
you'll immediately try to change. You'll think,

44:53.725 --> 44:59.332
“That's not correct, this is the truth about myself.”

44:59.468 --> 45:02.005
You start judging yourself all the time

45:02.120 --> 45:07.595
and you want to put yourself right
because you don't like it that way.

45:09.183 --> 45:13.658
So many ideas you have about your personal life

45:14.474 --> 45:17.011
are that, you see, there should be

45:17.120 --> 45:21.686
“a wife who should spoil me” or “a husband who should spoil me”,

45:21.778 --> 45:25.511
“My child should be like this”, and - all finished now.

45:26.199 --> 45:29.894
What do you want? “I want a real Sahaja Yogini”,

45:30.574 --> 45:33.296
“I want a real Sahaja Yogi to marry”,

45:33.422 --> 45:36.622
and after that the marriage becomes a blessing.

45:36.948 --> 45:42.276
How? How these flowers have come out, that's how.

45:44.023 --> 45:47.603
It's all innately built within you, all this beauty.

45:47.728 --> 45:54.786
You just start showing, but it has to sprout, it has to come up.

46:01.896 --> 46:07.492
This penance, so-called, is no penance to you.

46:07.650 --> 46:11.097
They say “We are enjoying this place”, I mean it's a

46:11.200 --> 46:15.109
place for penance only, the way things are here,

46:16.470 --> 46:19.735
there are not even closed bathrooms.

46:20.302 --> 46:24.302
People are finding it rather difficult to take a bath even.

46:25.228 --> 46:31.484
It's quite a penance to come to such a far-fetched place,

46:31.768 --> 46:35.654
or to travel in Maharashtra is another big penance.

46:35.801 --> 46:40.958
But you enjoy it, I mean you were missing; they said,
“We are missing our buses.” I said, “Really?

46:43.472 --> 46:48.982
I thought you would be happy. “No, no, Mother we are missing.”
I mean it was an adventure for them,

46:49.223 --> 46:55.683
they liked the way they were jostled and they were given hiccups,

46:55.842 --> 46:57.618
they’re very happy about it,

46:57.721 --> 47:01.097
that all this was, this was like an adventure.

47:01.358 --> 47:04.181
Everything which we call as tapasya

47:04.635 --> 47:07.954
or as the penance becomes an adventure for them,

47:08.057 --> 47:11.190
and the way they describe is very interesting.

47:11.560 --> 47:14.902
Like these musicians, they went to Russia and got lost,

47:15.027 --> 47:21.094
and when they came back, and they were describing the
whole thing with such description,

47:21.739 --> 47:25.569
as if God was just taking them from places to places.

47:26.420 --> 47:30.737
And how they were helped every moment, how they came

47:30.953 --> 47:35.680
to Italy sudden and how they came to Milan, to the ashram.

47:35.885 --> 47:38.966
The whole description is tremendous.

47:41.585 --> 47:48.323
Now think of what you have achieved, but you can't even think,

47:49.083 --> 47:50.565
you just achieve.

47:52.199 --> 47:59.784
Without thinking you achieve things,
is the blessing of your Spirit, blessing of Shiva.

48:00.907 --> 48:06.064
The Spirit is the witness and you develop that witness state.

48:07.085 --> 48:11.232
To you all this looks like a funny stage

48:11.335 --> 48:14.259
where people are doing this and that, politics, economics,

48:14.385 --> 48:16.775
you see as something absurd.

48:17.830 --> 48:21.296
I went down to Russia, there were so many Russians.

48:21.662 --> 48:26.372
I told them that there's a very bad shape the politics is here now

48:26.508 --> 48:29.238
and you are having very bad times with your food.

48:29.360 --> 48:32.934
“No, Mother, we have no problem with food or anything,

48:33.058 --> 48:36.899
but what do we care? We have got the spiritual food,

48:37.172 --> 48:41.341
let these people fight, do whatever, we are not bothered.”

48:43.133 --> 48:48.066
They were least bothered as there was a coup or anything,
least bothered.

48:48.939 --> 48:51.758
“Let them fight, let them do what they like,

48:51.927 --> 48:55.844
we are in a different situation.”

48:56.037 --> 49:00.056
I said, “Which situation you are?” “We are in the Kingdom of God,”

49:00.170 --> 49:01.391
they told Me,

49:01.720 --> 49:08.521
“We are in the Kingdom of God, why should we worry
about these kingdoms and things, let them fight.”

49:08.682 --> 49:13.044
Such contented people, so very beautiful.

49:13.200 --> 49:16.403
You have so many brothers and sisters there.

49:16.517 --> 49:20.428
Early in the morning I got up and they had, I don't know when,

49:20.520 --> 49:26.161
planted flowers on the road of My house there,

49:28.168 --> 49:31.229
flowers all along, rows after rows.

49:31.388 --> 49:36.284
I don't know when they came, when they did it and disappeared.

49:36.591 --> 49:40.613
So sweet, I tell you, except for

49:41.963 --> 49:45.670
crying with joy  I didn't know what to say.

49:46.391 --> 49:48.230
If this happens all over,

49:48.640 --> 49:50.964
what a world we can have.

49:51.440 --> 49:55.805
There are of course some people who are exceptional,
who are troublesome,

49:55.942 --> 50:02.289
who are not all right; it's all right, forget about them.

50:06.598 --> 50:16.953
So now, you are the people who have understood what is God,

50:18.439 --> 50:24.796
what is Sadashiva. Now you have faith in Him which is not blind,

50:25.171 --> 50:28.026
you also know that His powers work,

50:28.355 --> 50:32.955
that His laws work, all other laws are useless,
only His laws works.

50:37.551 --> 50:40.915
You have seen, experienced in your lifetime

50:41.267 --> 50:45.539
how miracles are taking place, how things are working out.

50:45.687 --> 50:48.918
A simple miracle I would say, it was desired

50:49.066 --> 50:52.796
that Shiva Puja should be around some hills,

50:53.397 --> 50:55.525
but they couldn't arrange,

50:55.662 --> 51:01.148
they were trying for some other place
which could not be arranged, so you are here.

51:01.364 --> 51:07.078
You desire and it works, as if your desire acts.

51:09.640 --> 51:13.379
But we have some people who are still mediocre,

51:13.549 --> 51:16.298
who are behaving in a mediocre manner,

51:16.411 --> 51:19.477
very dull, some of them are very dull people.

51:19.847 --> 51:21.847
They cannot understand Sahaj,

51:22.040 --> 51:26.131
they don't understand how much they can gain out of it.

51:26.415 --> 51:29.643
So you shouldn't worry about them.

51:30.845 --> 51:35.494
Then you have to think about the whole collective which is good

51:35.755 --> 51:39.088
and one or two useless people, forget about them.

51:39.574 --> 51:42.519
If they come up well and good, if they don't come up,

51:42.644 --> 51:45.127
we are not going to force them.

51:45.718 --> 51:50.454
We'll be getting more and more people, more and more people.

51:51.543 --> 51:54.387
I'm sure it will happen.

51:55.384 --> 51:59.651
But the greatest thing you have got is the complete integration

52:02.710 --> 52:08.263
within your being: your heart, your mind,

52:10.667 --> 52:15.959
your liver I should say, your attention, are all integrated.

52:17.082 --> 52:20.069
There's no quarrel, there's no struggle

52:20.889 --> 52:27.427
between your heart and your mind, heart and your brain.

52:28.210 --> 52:33.152
Whatever your brain thinks, your heart accepts,

52:33.435 --> 52:37.601
whatever your heart wants, your brain accepts,

52:37.794 --> 52:43.463
whatever your attention is there, is completely integrated

52:44.209 --> 52:47.928
with your heart and with your brain.

52:49.652 --> 52:53.852
You must see the other people, they don't want to do something

52:54.617 --> 52:58.140
but they have to do it because they’re habituated.

52:58.301 --> 53:01.881
So many people told Me: “We want to give up this, we can't.”

53:02.006 --> 53:05.744
Once you have got the Spirit, you get that power

53:06.550 --> 53:09.683
that you can surpass all the said temptations,

53:09.804 --> 53:13.509
not only temptations, also the differentiations

53:13.680 --> 53:16.602
that you always make: “This is that, this is that.”

53:16.728 --> 53:22.396
But you integrate, you integrate among yourselves,

53:23.077 --> 53:25.886
you integrate among different states,

53:26.011 --> 53:29.047
you integrate among different countries.

53:30.805 --> 53:35.450
The whole cosmos seems to be integrated, woven

53:36.188 --> 53:41.961
and governed by the Divine laws.

53:44.546 --> 53:51.655
This integration gives you a complete understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

53:54.522 --> 54:02.763
mentally, emotionally and spiritually.

54:07.240 --> 54:12.172
It’s not by some sort of a brain-washing

54:12.762 --> 54:19.165
or bombarding, but just through the light of Spirit
you have seen the truth

54:20.265 --> 54:25.217
and you have understood it. Also you have so many powers.

54:26.351 --> 54:30.551
You do not want to exert, that's a different point altogether,

54:30.988 --> 54:32.518
but just try.

54:34.798 --> 54:39.863
One word of prayer from you is very powerful

54:39.888 --> 54:43.775
than hundreds of prayers of these people.

54:47.483 --> 54:52.244
One asking is much more powerful

54:53.205 --> 54:55.776
than thousands of these askings.

54:56.151 --> 54:58.961
You have never tried that; try that,

54:59.494 --> 55:03.427
you are extremely powerful, whatever you desire works out.

55:06.761 --> 55:10.285
You have other powers of giving Realization,

55:10.603 --> 55:13.070
also curing, you have so many powers

55:13.665 --> 55:17.298
but most of the time you'll bring somebody to Me to be cured.

55:17.503 --> 55:20.110
No, no, there's no need.

55:20.428 --> 55:24.561
You have given all powers; you have all the powers, use them.

55:25.338 --> 55:29.916
Don't be afraid, use these powers, and you will be amazed

55:30.472 --> 55:32.789
how these power work out,

55:34.286 --> 55:44.109
and how you become more and more embedded in your faith,
in yourself.

55:47.045 --> 55:49.616
Of course there are Sahaja Yogis

55:49.934 --> 55:53.585
who are made to sit on the throne but still they are begging,

55:53.676 --> 55:55.881
what can you do about it?

55:58.421 --> 56:03.443
You are so very powerful in collective and also individually.

56:05.882 --> 56:08.737
Whatever you want, you can have it.

56:09.656 --> 56:13.096
I am desireless because the Divine,

56:14.281 --> 56:20.410
the Divine power is working for Me, everything
- I don't have to desire - it knows.

56:21.714 --> 56:24.981
I don't desire anything, but you have to desire,

56:26.742 --> 56:30.394
you have to pray, you have to ask.

56:30.712 --> 56:34.554
And the wider you become your prayers will be wider,

56:34.702 --> 56:37.581
for a wider world, wider vision,

56:38.012 --> 56:41.348
not limited to your children, not limited to your family,

56:41.439 --> 56:47.289
not limited to one place, but unlimited areas you'll cover.

56:53.462 --> 56:58.156
So we become very conscious and alert

56:58.701 --> 57:03.619
about whatever is happening in the world
to put our attention there.

57:03.778 --> 57:08.197
We try to find out what's wrong with this
and what's wrong with that.

57:08.334 --> 57:11.347
We are not just worried about a small little ashram,

57:11.449 --> 57:15.689
but we are worried about the whole world to find out what's wrong,

57:15.880 --> 57:17.873
what can we do, what can we desire,

57:17.953 --> 57:24.222
because if we have the power,
and if we can operate the Divine power,

57:25.467 --> 57:29.016
then why not we work it out ourselves? We can.

57:29.334 --> 57:32.108
So your attention can go to any place.

57:32.189 --> 57:34.059
It can go to Nicaragua,

57:37.212 --> 57:44.012
it can go to Israel, it can go to Saddam Hussein,
to any place that you want to work it out.

57:44.522 --> 57:47.199
It moves, it's mobile, it's universal.

57:48.538 --> 57:55.471
Just start expanding your heart, your mind and your attention.

58:01.319 --> 58:08.039
Your faith in Me, I must say, is great.
I am Myself surprised at that.

58:15.729 --> 58:17.744
I am quite a camouflage.

58:18.992 --> 58:22.925
It's not easy to understand Me, I don't understand Myself!

58:30.339 --> 58:34.718
On one side of course I'm Divine, no doubt,

58:36.453 --> 58:39.500
on the other side, I am very human.

58:40.657 --> 58:46.505
Even in a film, if I see somebody suffering,
I start crying, can't bear.

58:47.208 --> 58:51.416
I can't cure children because I can't see their sufferings.

58:51.609 --> 58:57.169
It's another aspect of Mine. I’ve made Myself extremely human,

59:01.512 --> 59:07.772
and this Divinity of Mine also is just Sahaj.

59:09.212 --> 59:10.744
I've done nothing,

59:11.459 --> 59:15.926
I've been like this and I'm like this, I've not achieved anything.

59:16.221 --> 59:20.288
If I've achieved anything, is understanding of human beings,

59:21.040 --> 59:24.688
because I always felt that all these Incarnations

59:24.858 --> 59:30.082
and all these prophets never understood human beings.

59:30.253 --> 59:33.867
They never knew that they are not enlightened people

59:33.969 --> 59:38.187
and no use talking to them of these great things, it’s all a waste.

59:38.301 --> 59:40.067
It's like a blind person,

59:40.464 --> 59:44.664
you explain to him all the colors and the beauty of the stage.

59:49.115 --> 01:00:00.795
And so this human realization,
I should, that I had, is so beautiful.

01:00:03.278 --> 01:00:06.953
Now I understand what is the joy of bhakti,

01:00:07.975 --> 01:00:11.339
what is the joy of gnyana,

01:00:12.836 --> 01:00:19.480
what is the joy of karma, because a person
who doesn't do anything,

01:00:20.775 --> 01:00:29.941
a person who has no bhakti and who has no gnyana

01:00:34.806 --> 01:00:37.282
is just wakened completely.

01:00:39.664 --> 01:00:42.636
I had to fill in Myself with all these things

01:00:42.761 --> 01:00:45.368
that I have to know the gnyana,

01:00:45.505 --> 01:00:49.232
not the gnyana of the Divine because after all that is,

01:00:49.369 --> 01:00:55.184
that is not difficult, because if I am that, I know that,

01:00:55.718 --> 01:00:58.648
but the gnyana of the human beings,

01:01:00.247 --> 01:01:06.018
the problems of the human beings, I had to study for years

01:01:06.676 --> 01:01:11.605
the human beings to work it out.

01:01:13.147 --> 01:01:15.401
But once it has worked,

01:01:17.442 --> 01:01:22.842
that's what is said that there is Divinity in
you has started expressing itself,

01:01:24.029 --> 01:01:28.165
and such beautiful Divine lights are sitting before Me.

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:35.578
I bless you all from My heart where resides the Shiva,
the Sadashiva,

01:01:36.474 --> 01:01:38.603
and Sadashiva blesses you.

01:01:39.147 --> 01:01:43.521
He is a innocent personality, absolutely innocent.

01:01:44.111 --> 01:01:50.814
He is the One who is beyond any attachments,

01:01:54.828 --> 01:01:57.161
absolutely beyond any attachments.

01:01:58.642 --> 01:02:06.396
He is the One who is watching,
watching all of you with such admiration,

01:02:07.587 --> 01:02:17.027
His joy knows no bounds, it's tremendous,
as if He is dancing with joy.

01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:26.415
It's a great day for us to celebrate this Shiva Puja here.

01:02:26.801 --> 01:02:31.198
I hope all of you respect the principle of Shiva within you,

01:02:31.311 --> 01:02:33.482
that's the most important.

01:02:33.766 --> 01:02:41.770
And look after your vibrations, which pulsates in your being,

01:02:42.088 --> 01:02:47.101
because the Spirit has awakened in your attention,

01:02:47.453 --> 01:02:50.398
in your central nervous system.

01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:53.780
That's the most important thing you have to do.

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:57.416
The rest of it is Sahaj.

01:02:59.448 --> 01:03:02.157
The rest of it is absolutely Sahaj.

01:03:02.575 --> 01:03:04.675
May God bless you all.
