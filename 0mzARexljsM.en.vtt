Shri Mahakali Puja, "Ascent". San Diego (USA), 19 June 1989.

07:28.960 --> 07:32.360
Today we have decided to have Mahakali Puja.

07:33.250 --> 07:41.890
Now we must understand the Mahakali is in totality

07:43.730 --> 07:46.810
is a reflection of Adi Shakti in totality;

07:47.450 --> 07:52.130
or we can call it that Adi Shakti is in charge,

07:52.490 --> 07:55.370
She's managing all these three powers.

07:55.650 --> 07:59.930
But Her manifestation in totality is Mahakali

08:00.130 --> 08:06.130
in the sense that it is the desire of God Almighty.

08:08.090 --> 08:14.130
So first She's Adi Shakti in charge of all the three powers

08:14.930 --> 08:23.770
and that's why we can say that when She is in a potential stage

08:23.970 --> 08:31.730
She is Mahakali and then She divides Herself into two other forces

08:32.170 --> 08:34.890
as Mahasaraswati

08:35.210 --> 08:44.650
and the ascending force that we call,

08:44.930 --> 08:48.050
or as a parasympathetic nervous system

08:48.610 --> 08:51.090
expressed in us is the Mahalakshmi force.

08:51.290 --> 08:55.050
So She has actually all these forces in Herself,

08:55.250 --> 09:00.850
Mahakali has all these forces but She manifests,

09:02.050 --> 09:05.490
She desires to act and when She wants to act

09:05.690 --> 09:09.810
Her potential force becomes these two other forces.

09:12.250 --> 09:16.370
So when we do the Puja of Mahakali, we must understand

09:16.690 --> 09:22.770
that inbuilt within this force within us is desire;

09:24.890 --> 09:30.010
so we can desire anything, if we want we can desire everything,

09:30.370 --> 09:38.130
we can desire say the joy, we can desire the knowledge,

09:38.690 --> 09:42.410
we can desire to be compassionate and love and we can desire also

09:42.610 --> 09:46.890
the destruction of those which are negative forces.

09:47.410 --> 09:49.890
But the Mahakali force is the one

09:50.210 --> 09:54.370
which is working out the constructive force

09:54.770 --> 09:59.570
but in that constructive force only there has to be destruction,

10:00.050 --> 10:05.010
because if you are constructing something and there is destruction

10:05.210 --> 10:09.210
which is trying to destroy your construction then you have to

10:09.490 --> 10:12.130
destroy that destructive personality;

10:12.730 --> 10:17.010
and this is what people sometimes misunderstand

10:17.450 --> 10:21.650
and they think that Mahakali force is negative force

10:21.850 --> 10:27.730
or is a force of destruction, it is, but in a very positive way

10:31.050 --> 10:34.210
and if you understand this part of Mahakali force

10:34.410 --> 10:38.050
then you will understand that if you have desires

10:38.410 --> 10:42.490
to construct yourself properly in Sahaja Yoga

10:43.130 --> 10:46.770
then you should also have the desire to destroy

10:47.050 --> 10:51.290
whatever is standing against your construction.

10:52.890 --> 10:57.170
So one by one we should see within ourselves what sort of things

10:57.370 --> 11:03.010
that drag us down and thus they do not give us this desire.

11:03.450 --> 11:09.570
If this desire becomes intense then you start immediately

11:09.770 --> 11:15.010
seeing what are the forces that are destroying your ascent.

11:15.210 --> 11:20.410
So we have to ascend is the point, our goal is to ascend,

11:20.610 --> 11:24.050
our destination is to ascend; so our desire should be

11:24.530 --> 11:28.690
that we should ascend and construct our being in such a manner

11:29.170 --> 11:32.130
that we can receive all the...

11:43.690 --> 11:48.690
so we should understand that we have to be prepared

11:48.890 --> 11:51.290
to destroy many things within us,

11:51.530 --> 12:00.210
if we have to become great evolved personalities

12:00.410 --> 12:04.850
As you have seen in evolution itself you had huge big animals

12:05.050 --> 12:09.410
like mammoth this that and they they could not cope with the evolution

12:09.610 --> 12:13.530
so they were all destroyed, so many thing were destroyed,

12:14.930 --> 12:18.090
and this destruction is built in within us,

12:18.370 --> 12:22.450
when we ascend we just start seeing that these are the forces

12:22.930 --> 12:34.050
which are destroying us and that our destruction is so much

12:34.370 --> 12:38.370
that if we do not desire the destruction of these destructive forces

12:38.410 --> 12:40.410
we'll be finished.

12:41.210 --> 12:47.050
So at the same time, when we are ascending higher we have to know

12:47.250 --> 12:52.850
what we have to destroy. For example even in living forces

12:53.930 --> 12:58.370
when a flower becomes a fruit,

12:58.850 --> 13:05.890
lots of things which were the part of the flower get destroyed,

13:06.930 --> 13:11.650
automatically, but that is done in the will of God

13:11.890 --> 13:16.970
by His own understanding. So it's absolutely perfect.

13:17.250 --> 13:21.850
So in Sahaja Yoga when we desire something, we must know

13:22.050 --> 13:30.570
what we desire, first fix your goal and then relate it to that.

13:31.690 --> 13:35.330
Now there are many deviations in life, like you are going

13:35.530 --> 13:39.130
to the airport, our attention should be we have to reach the airport

13:39.490 --> 13:42.330
and whatever are distractions are distractions;

13:42.610 --> 13:43.970
we should not get lost with it,

13:44.250 --> 13:46.610
if you get lost with those distractions,

13:46.810 --> 13:49.850
then we cannot achieve our goal in time.

13:50.170 --> 13:56.970
So one has to understand first of all that our goal is to ascend

13:57.450 --> 14:04.650
and for that the distractions are on our way, because of ourselves,

14:04.850 --> 14:07.290
because of ignorance, because of darkness,

14:07.490 --> 14:10.050
because the light is not so much.

14:10.530 --> 14:14.810
The first destroying factor that is within us

14:15.690 --> 14:18.530
is the Shri Ganesha's power

14:19.850 --> 14:23.690
and this Shri Ganesha is the power of Mahakali.

14:24.650 --> 14:30.570
She first planted Shri Ganesha to emit holiness on this Earth,

14:31.170 --> 14:33.130
so the whole thing could be vibrated

14:33.370 --> 14:39.210
and as you know one aspect of Shri Ganesha is also Omkara,

14:39.570 --> 14:44.450
means this vibratory awareness which flows everywhere.

14:44.930 --> 14:50.250
So these vibrations have four sides in it:

14:50.770 --> 14:58.530
one is that these vibrations establish holiness,

14:58.770 --> 15:04.090
auspiciousness through Mahakali power;

15:05.610 --> 15:13.530
then these same vibrations also comfort us through Mahakali power.

15:15.570 --> 15:20.210
Vibrations do not give you desires as such, if you see,

15:20.610 --> 15:23.250
they do not give you desires,

15:23.450 --> 15:29.210
but they give you proof of your desires being fulfilled.

15:30.330 --> 15:34.330
Supposing you want somebody to be cured, this is your desire

15:34.970 --> 15:39.570
and you give vibrations to that person; so it's a means,

15:41.970 --> 15:49.330
so it is also the action part which is there in those vibrations,

15:50.170 --> 15:54.290
but this action also comes from desire.

15:54.290 --> 15:57.690
If you don't have desire you won't act,

15:58.370 --> 16:05.570
so the desire is so important even to establish your own path,

16:05.810 --> 16:10.490
to establish your forward march, if your desire is poor,

16:10.690 --> 16:14.090
if you're half hearted you can't work it out.

16:14.890 --> 16:18.210
Half hearted people cannot achieve anything in Sahaja Yoga,

16:18.650 --> 16:22.490
it's not meant for half hearted people, it's meant for people

16:22.690 --> 16:30.290
who are brave, who have intense desire,

16:30.850 --> 16:37.570
who are intelligent and who are auspicious.

16:39.530 --> 16:46.970
But in case you do not have intense desire,

16:47.450 --> 16:49.890
then the pure desire doesn't work

16:50.090 --> 16:55.650
and you do not get your realisation; also after getting realisation

16:55.850 --> 17:00.010
unless and until you have desire to ascend,

17:00.490 --> 17:05.290
very strong intense desire to ascend, you cannot ascend.

17:05.610 --> 17:09.650
So for all Sahaja Yogis it is necessary to first of all

17:09.850 --> 17:12.810
early in the morning, while taking the name of Ganesha,

17:13.090 --> 17:16.410
must say what is my desire, this is my goal,

17:16.730 --> 17:22.370
this is what it is, all activity must be surrendered for this work.

17:23.850 --> 17:30.970
So now how our desires are curbed, first of all

17:31.490 --> 17:35.410
through conditionings. We have certain conditionings.

17:36.090 --> 17:39.850
After Sahaja Yoga people become very affectionate,

17:40.450 --> 17:45.810
so immediately even if in the west - where the family is

17:46.010 --> 17:51.050
not so important, children are not so important,
selfishness is there,

17:51.850 --> 17:57.330
people think about themselves only, they cannot think of others -

17:57.690 --> 18:04.730
even in those countries, it starts developing a kind of a,

18:05.730 --> 18:12.570
another cocoon of myness, my child, my house, my home, my family;

18:15.370 --> 18:18.610
then the attention starts working on that,

18:18.890 --> 18:24.850
you become half hearted towards your ascent, because you're ascending

18:27.290 --> 18:33.170
in a way so called and also you are spreading out.

18:37.530 --> 18:43.850
Then the concern goes to other conditionings we have.

18:45.130 --> 18:48.050
Like the other day I met one fellow he said that "Mother,

18:48.290 --> 18:52.250
I'm a Sahaja Yogi, I know but I can't get over the idea of Christ",

18:52.330 --> 18:55.610
I said "Who has asked you to get over idea of Christ?

18:55.810 --> 18:58.690
Christ is there, in Sahaja Yoga very much,

18:58.890 --> 19:02.450
but understand it in its own comprehensive way

19:03.210 --> 19:05.050
and see for yourself!".

19:05.250 --> 19:10.810
But this conditioning is of thoughts. Supposing if you have read

19:11.010 --> 19:15.370
too many books, if you have gone through...

19:15.570 --> 19:18.170
supposing you are a born Hindu or a born Christian

19:18.370 --> 19:22.610
or born Jew or anything, so the conditioning is there.

19:23.290 --> 19:28.290
You were born as a human being, you got this stamp later on

19:28.490 --> 19:32.090
that you are a Hindu or a Christian or anything.

19:32.290 --> 19:35.330
These stamps you did not carry when you were born.

19:35.850 --> 19:39.690
Supposing the child was lost, he could be any religion,

19:40.090 --> 19:43.930
so these are not really your innate religions,

19:44.410 --> 19:48.850
this is just a stamp you have got, like Christian or anything.

19:49.530 --> 19:53.650
Then you have another conditioning, that you belong to this nation,

19:53.850 --> 19:59.090
that nation, like we have, we have America, this, that, that,

19:59.610 --> 20:03.450
but still these are stamps. You were born in America,

20:03.650 --> 20:08.010
that's why you are an American, anybody who is born in America

20:08.210 --> 20:10.690
is not different from anybody else.

20:11.170 --> 20:14.410
Only thing according to the climate of a particular place,

20:14.650 --> 20:18.530
you might have your complexion, your height, your face and all that,

20:18.770 --> 20:23.170
but that doesn't mean that innately this is meant for America,

20:23.210 --> 20:25.330
it could be anywhere.

20:26.130 --> 20:30.690
Then all these conditionings within us start acting on our language,

20:30.890 --> 20:34.210
on our styles, on our lives in every way.

20:34.410 --> 20:36.850
Then we start becoming Americans,

20:37.610 --> 20:40.770
so these are the effects of the outside that come in us

20:40.970 --> 20:43.290
and then we say we the Americans,

20:43.650 --> 20:51.650
but if you scratch them inside body's the same, heart is the same,

20:52.090 --> 20:55.290
the blood is the same, everything is the same,

20:55.490 --> 21:01.410
there's nothing different, it's even not skin deep.

21:01.770 --> 21:06.090
But in the brain it has gone that "I am an American".

21:07.490 --> 21:11.050
Then all these things that are in that society,

21:11.250 --> 21:17.170
for example in America so many things are allowed so that's alright,

21:18.170 --> 21:21.530
in India many things are allowed, that's alright,

21:21.930 --> 21:26.210
like that we start accepting the society, the norms of the society

21:26.410 --> 21:28.450
and the conditioning starts.

21:30.850 --> 21:37.930
But with all that, this desire is there, the pure desire to ascend.

21:40.730 --> 21:44.250
I think you put these lights little ahead because they are so,

21:44.450 --> 21:48.250
paper there and with my force, light is going behind,

21:51.970 --> 21:56.930
no, no, not that one please, because they are facing that fan,

22:00.610 --> 22:08.330
could bring them down here, still quite close to that fan you know,

22:08.570 --> 22:12.650
you can put them anywhere, you can put them here if you want,

22:22.130 --> 22:27.210
you see because my, the air is blowing that way and they are all going that way.

22:33.730 --> 22:38.930
So the desire within us to ascend comes to us

22:39.250 --> 22:41.610
also as a reaction to all these things,

22:44.010 --> 22:48.650
when we see as Americans what's happening to our country,

22:48.890 --> 22:53.650
what's happening to the people, what's happening to our surroundings

22:54.010 --> 22:58.890
and then we get a shock. Oh God! What is this?

22:59.690 --> 23:04.490
Then we also see this is artificiality, like in England

23:04.850 --> 23:07.090
you have to wear a tail coat, you have to wear this,

23:07.330 --> 23:11.610
you have to have this kind of spoon, this kind of a glass, this that

23:11.850 --> 23:15.690
so reaction builds in; so you start anti-culture,

23:17.330 --> 23:20.570
anti-culture to get rid of artificiality.

23:21.370 --> 23:25.970
Well the desire behind it is, is to seek the reality.

23:27.410 --> 23:31.650
To seek reality then they have hair just like primitive people,

23:31.850 --> 23:35.890
they live like primitive people and the reaction is built in

23:36.690 --> 23:39.930
behind all that is the same desire, is to ascend.

23:40.930 --> 23:45.170
So this Mahalakshmi power is acting within us,

23:45.610 --> 23:52.610
it is giving us all kinds of shows, we can say, alright you want to have,

23:52.970 --> 23:57.890
say variety of things, go ahead with it, then you go crazy you see

23:58.290 --> 24:03.410
what is this going on, why should we be so mad about it.

24:04.090 --> 24:18.290
Now they want to have, a, you want to have say, your children,

24:18.570 --> 24:23.770
your home, your houses; then you just get fed up with it, because

24:24.370 --> 24:29.050
children become arrogant, they become horrid, they trouble you,

24:29.250 --> 24:32.450
then you say, "Oh God! I'll never have any children any more!"

24:33.010 --> 24:36.650
Then you have wives and you find wives horrible and husbands horrible,

24:36.930 --> 24:40.090
then you divorce, you go on divorcing, divorcing, divorcing

24:40.330 --> 24:44.210
and then you find it's useless, it doesn't work out,

24:44.690 --> 24:49.130
nothing seems to work out, you feel so frustrated

24:49.530 --> 24:54.130
and that action and reaction works on your desires.

24:54.370 --> 24:56.930
So your desires go on changing,

24:58.450 --> 25:02.690
especially when we are wanting to be affluent,

25:04.530 --> 25:11.290
people become affluent and then they find the problems of affluence,

25:12.570 --> 25:14.810
so a reaction is built in,

25:15.970 --> 25:19.050
those who witness those problems of the rich,

25:19.370 --> 25:22.490
they don't want to be that rich, nothing doing.

25:23.690 --> 25:28.570
So in every way the desire to achieve things works out,

25:28.810 --> 25:31.970
like some people want to have power, they go into politics,

25:32.090 --> 25:36.570
fight it, get it done and done forever.

25:38.930 --> 25:43.090
So lives after lives it goes on.

25:43.330 --> 25:47.730
Then you are born in modern times when I am here

25:48.170 --> 25:54.570
and now your only strong desire is to become The Spirit - I hope it is.

25:57.770 --> 26:03.370
So now all these back things are to be crossed over,

26:03.570 --> 26:09.250
they are finished, now what should we do for our realisation,

26:10.170 --> 26:12.450
what action we should take?

26:13.530 --> 26:18.650
The first action is to develop your Mahakali power,

26:19.970 --> 26:24.450
by one power you destroy all that is nonsensical,

26:24.850 --> 26:32.130
destroy all that is impeding you, troubling you, blocking you,

26:32.290 --> 26:35.450
destroy all that, just I don't want it.

26:39.330 --> 26:42.690
Because I have seen Sahaja Yogis suddenly go off,

26:43.450 --> 26:46.690
like you have to go to the airport, suddenly you find

26:46.890 --> 26:52.490
they have fallen into one of the gutters. "What happened?"

26:52.970 --> 26:57.410
"Mother, we felt like going there", but why?

26:59.250 --> 27:02.770
So keep your attention on that point.

27:05.090 --> 27:08.370
Some people get married, in Sahaja Yoga also,

27:08.610 --> 27:11.850
they have a desire to marry, have children, this thing,

27:12.050 --> 27:16.810
but in that also they get fixed up. Marriage is not the end,

27:17.050 --> 27:20.410
it's just one of the means to be balanced.

27:21.650 --> 27:29.170
So we have to have desire that we have to achieve something

27:29.370 --> 27:33.610
so go on destroying all that is within us, within us is there are

27:34.090 --> 27:43.210
six enemies as they say, is anger, then greed, jealousies, violence,

27:43.450 --> 27:48.250
all these are within us, so have to destroy these six enemies.

27:50.650 --> 27:55.610
But what's the power of a Mahakali is that she destroys

27:55.810 --> 27:58.890
all the enemies that stand in your way,

27:59.450 --> 28:02.730
all the rakshasas, all the devils all the negative forces,

28:02.850 --> 28:05.770
she tries to destroy, so that your [path] should be all right;

28:05.970 --> 28:07.650
but while She is destroying all of them

28:07.730 --> 28:11.450
if you are sticking on to them, what can She do?

28:11.690 --> 28:15.530
So your desire should be pure and that you should say that all right:

28:15.730 --> 28:19.850
"We want to achieve that", and she is working it out for you.

28:22.410 --> 28:25.610
This is the first thing, Her job.

28:26.810 --> 28:30.490
Then the second job is that She comforts,

28:30.770 --> 28:33.570
She gives you comforts, of every kind.

28:33.890 --> 28:37.090
The first comfort She gives you is of your body,

28:37.290 --> 28:42.250
your body becomes comfortable, means all your diseases and

28:42.450 --> 28:48.170
all your troubles are destroyed. You find that your body becomes

28:48.370 --> 28:51.530
healthy, you feel younger, you get energy

28:51.730 --> 28:54.930
and you can work out your realisation.

28:55.410 --> 28:59.890
This is the first thing She does for you: is to give you comfort.

29:00.290 --> 29:03.770
Then she also gives you comfort of the Spirit,

29:05.730 --> 29:12.890
so that you do not ask for artificial comforts,

29:13.250 --> 29:18.050
you can live anywhere, you can live in a jungle, you are comfortable;

29:18.410 --> 29:23.450
if you live in the most busiest place you are comfortable,

29:23.690 --> 29:27.690
so you are comfortable everywhere and that sort of a comfort

29:27.970 --> 29:30.370
she can establish within you.

29:31.970 --> 29:40.810
Then the highest of all Her boon is that She gives you the joy,

29:41.250 --> 29:50.170
joy of every kind, joy that emits from everything, from everyone.

29:50.930 --> 29:55.650
So that is the highest you get when you keep your desire,

29:55.850 --> 30:00.770
the flame of your desire burning, till you reach that state

30:00.970 --> 30:10.370
of spiritual attainment, then you find that no more desire is left;

30:10.730 --> 30:16.770
but only one, if it is any, that "let the whole world be realised".

30:17.170 --> 30:20.810
Like a drunkard, you see, he wants to enjoy his drinking with others,

30:21.050 --> 30:24.450
like that you become, you are drunk in your joy and

30:24.650 --> 30:27.730
why not others enjoy, so you work for it.

30:30.450 --> 30:34.690
But human beings, I have seen, they move like a yo-yo,

30:35.050 --> 30:38.770
they achieve their spiritual attainment they have the joy

30:39.050 --> 30:43.370
and then they go back to help people, they get caught up with them,

30:43.810 --> 30:48.970
they are not strong enough; because the Mahakali power is not strong.

30:49.730 --> 30:54.290
And another is the weakness of the Mooladhara.

30:55.810 --> 31:01.650
Weakness of the Mooladhara makes you imbalanced

31:02.090 --> 31:05.290
and in that imbalance you lose your will.

31:05.970 --> 31:10.690
So one has to be very careful that our Mooladhara must be fixed properly.

31:12.570 --> 31:16.290
There are so many ways by which you can fix up your Mooladhara

31:16.610 --> 31:19.650
and you must fix up your Mooladhara first;

31:19.850 --> 31:26.570
then your desire absolutely moves like a kite moves in the sky,

31:27.050 --> 31:30.850
stuck to Mooladhara and you can move into any direction

31:31.050 --> 31:35.170
to any height, wherever you go you are quite in charge,

31:35.370 --> 31:37.290
you know how you are moving.

31:41.090 --> 31:45.050
It can bind your attention, everything. So what we say that

31:45.330 --> 31:50.450
the roots are very important first to be established

31:50.770 --> 31:54.610
for the growth of your desire upward, like a tree.

31:56.170 --> 32:00.890
So they go hand in hand, Mahakali power and Ganesha's power

32:01.090 --> 32:06.010
go hand in hand because that's the foundation;

32:06.370 --> 32:11.210
if it is based on that foundation, desires grow much stronger

32:11.530 --> 32:16.930
and stronger and effective and they do not deviate.

32:18.410 --> 32:24.610
Every sort of desire is fulfilled till you reach that state where

32:25.130 --> 32:29.570
there's no other desire left but to enjoy, you just enjoy,

32:29.770 --> 32:34.290
without any desire, desirelessly you enjoy.

32:37.730 --> 32:41.770
And that state is to be enjoyed, just to be enjoyed.

32:42.050 --> 32:45.770
What is there to talk about it? What is there to say about it?

32:45.970 --> 32:50.690
You just are lost in the ocean of enjoyment

32:52.330 --> 32:59.570
and that should happen everywhere and that's what you are worshipping.

33:00.010 --> 33:03.250
So now I hope you have hundred and eight names of Mahakali,

33:03.450 --> 33:05.570
and if you have the hundred and eight names of Mahakali

33:05.770 --> 33:13.610
you will see one by one that her these stages are working out for you,

33:14.050 --> 33:19.330
how manifest that you can see in those names.

33:19.770 --> 33:24.850
So now first we'll have a one Atarva Sheersha

33:25.050 --> 33:28.870
and then we can have these hundred and eight names.

33:30.970 --> 33:33.890
