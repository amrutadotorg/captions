00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.640
Mahashivaratri Puja, Pune (India), 15 February 2004.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.280
(Translated from Hindi)

00:00:19.288 --> 00:00:28.568
Today we are here to do the Guru's puja

00:00:31.714 --> 00:00:42.074
The Guru is praised more than the Deities and the Gods

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.440
Who is this Guru?

00:00:51.787 --> 00:00:59.325
In this, which is the most important shakti?

00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:12.560
The Guru tattwa is the Shiva.

00:01:13.137 --> 00:01:31.337
The form of the Shiva's power we should consider as the Guru's power.

00:01:32.247 --> 00:01:39.938
Because when we take the powers from the Guru's shakti,

00:01:40.104 --> 00:01:48.756
and when the shaktis come within us then we ourselves become the Guru

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:57.853
And with this, we are blessed for the whole life (Kalyan).

00:01:58.131 --> 00:02:02.796
The one who gets these powers,

00:02:02.931 --> 00:02:08.360
it seems he has got all the blessings (kalyan).

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:14.831
"Kalyan" is a word which is very hard to explain in a few words.

00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:23.746
"Kalyan" means to get blessed from all the sides.

00:02:23.947 --> 00:02:28.520
the obtain joy from all the sides.

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:34.479
When someone says that in the blessings you have got the Kalyan,

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.160
what does it mean?

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.797
What is Kalyan?

00:02:39.998 --> 00:02:48.998
Kalyan means Atma Sakshatkar, the Self-Realisation.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.600
Without the Self-Realisation, you cannot have the Kalyan.

00:02:55.801 --> 00:03:03.252
Nobody can understand without having it.

00:03:03.453 --> 00:03:08.767
All these things are in the Kalyan.

00:03:08.968 --> 00:03:18.818
Because of this a person gets all the joy, and he becomes radiant.

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:28.810
To have this Kalyan, whatever you have to do you have done it all,

00:03:29.011 --> 00:03:32.591
whatever efforts you have to make it has all been made,

00:03:32.792 --> 00:03:36.362
the faith which you have to take, you have already taken it.

00:03:36.563 --> 00:03:40.008
But when you are all in the "Kalyanmarg" (Path of Kalyan),

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.854
when he has given the mantra to have the Kalyan,

00:03:43.055 --> 00:03:45.558
what does it mean?

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:51.039
It means that the most important thing

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.984
inside you is samadhan (satisfaction).

00:03:55.273 --> 00:03:59.433
Afterwards you all don't have to search for anything,

00:03:59.634 --> 00:04:03.955
you have all become the Gurus.

00:04:04.156 --> 00:04:09.179
You don't have to take some great things in this moment,

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.999
but the blessings of this samadhana

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.986
you all can feel inside yourselves,

00:04:15.187 --> 00:04:17.816
you all can know inside yourselves

00:04:18.017 --> 00:04:23.800
you all can enjoy within yourselves.

00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:28.963
First of all you all can see that the physical diseases,

00:04:29.164 --> 00:04:40.034
the physical problems can be removed by this Kalyanmarg,

00:04:40.235 --> 00:04:44.706
all the problems which are coming within you

00:04:44.907 --> 00:04:51.000
that prevent you from blossoming,

00:04:52.490 --> 00:05:03.196
can be removed by this Kalyanmarg.

00:05:03.397 --> 00:05:16.370
When you all take to this, you get the Kalyan

00:05:16.571 --> 00:05:26.399
and you have the Self-Realisation.

00:05:27.423 --> 00:05:33.587
In this Shri Mahadeva is helping you.

00:05:33.788 --> 00:05:39.613
When the kundalini opens the sahasrara,

00:05:39.814 --> 00:05:43.771
Shri Mahadeva is sitting over there.

00:05:43.972 --> 00:05:47.198
And because of this, we call Him Mahadeva.

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:51.399
It means the God of all the Gods, Mahadeva.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:57.313
in this Kalyan there are many important aspects.

00:05:57.514 --> 00:06:02.774
The first thing is shanti (peace).

00:06:02.975 --> 00:06:14.482
Mental peace, physical peace and the peace in the family life.

00:06:14.683 --> 00:06:19.843
In the family life there are many problems, many obstacles,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.940
and all these can be solved by the Kalyanmarg.

00:06:27.141 --> 00:06:37.239
Afterwards we cannot even feel the presence of the obstacles.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.158
In this way we could see many people in the whole world

00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:47.589
getting blessings from this Kalyanmarg and meditating upon it

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.590
and enjoying for the whole life.

00:06:53.848 --> 00:06:56.725
This is the Kalyan by which mankind

00:06:56.926 --> 00:07:00.359
can get the balances within themselves.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.422
And to obtain this balance,

00:07:04.623 --> 00:07:08.479
you have to go under the protection of the Guru.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:16.845
When you become the devotee of a Guru,

00:07:17.046 --> 00:07:22.460
you get the balance and you get everything.

00:07:22.661 --> 00:07:25.300
After this you do not need anything.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:30.869
In this way we get the balance

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:36.252
and we obtain the power of love within ourselves.

00:07:36.453 --> 00:07:45.308
When mankind obtains this, this whole body rejoices.

00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:52.996
When you obtain this state,

00:07:53.197 --> 00:08:01.277
the shaktis (powers) destroy all the problems,

00:08:01.493 --> 00:08:12.213
the disturbances in the body and the physical state,

00:08:12.884 --> 00:08:22.471
and so many people try very hard to obtain this shakti.

00:08:22.672 --> 00:08:28.533
He can get the shakti only form a person that is self-realised.

00:08:28.734 --> 00:08:36.357
and then he himself becomes in the God's form.

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:38.191
Talk in English

00:08:38.392 --> 00:08:47.753
This is a subject which you can only explain in Hindi language,

00:08:47.954 --> 00:08:56.717
which says that this Guru Padh you get from somebody else.

00:08:56.918 --> 00:09:02.998
But that somebody else is itself, is endowed with, the power

00:09:03.199 --> 00:09:08.603
the power of peace of mind, to begin with,

00:09:08.804 --> 00:09:22.049
and also the power to overcome all kinds of of earthly problems,

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:26.882
mental problems, physical problems.

00:09:27.083 --> 00:09:32.061
All these problems you can solve through your mental balance

00:09:32.262 --> 00:09:39.308
and mental blessings from your Guru.

00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:41.349
When you become the Guru,

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:47.301
you yourself have the power, to bless others.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:57.504
With your blessing power you can create a guru out of many.

00:09:58.046 --> 00:10:07.348
And once the Guru is created and there is a Guru,

00:10:07.549 --> 00:10:13.241
who has this power, it's very satisfying and is very [UNCLEAR: enabling?].

00:10:13.442 --> 00:10:20.682
The satisfaction is so much that you don't want anything.

00:10:20.883 --> 00:10:24.126
This is the power of Shiva.

00:10:24.327 --> 00:10:28.407
You have seen Shiva, doesn't have much clothes,

00:10:28.608 --> 00:10:31.048
He doesn't decorate Himself,

00:10:31.249 --> 00:10:35.474
He is just sitting in meditative mood, all the time.

00:10:35.675 --> 00:10:37.792
He doesn't want anything.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:43.379
He's so satisfied with Himself that He doesn't want anything.

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:49.646
And that is the power you get after the Self-realization,

00:10:49.847 --> 00:10:56.851
if you have a Guru, and Guru of that level and caliber.

00:10:57.052 --> 00:11:00.003
One should not try to become a Guru.

00:11:00.204 --> 00:11:03.837
That's very, impractical.

00:11:04.038 --> 00:11:06.725
If you try to become, you'll never.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:10.070
It has to come to you automatically,

00:11:10.271 --> 00:11:14.804
without any asking, without any effort.

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:20.021
So the only way you can get to it is through Dhyana.

00:11:20.222 --> 00:11:22.532
Dhyana is meditation.

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.980
When you meditate,

00:11:25.043 --> 00:11:31.984
just meditate, and meditate, do not ask for anything.

00:11:32.185 --> 00:11:34.980
Meditation itself gives you

00:11:35.181 --> 00:11:43.814
that instrument which can bear this great power of the Guru.

00:11:44.015 --> 00:11:48.900
And then you automatically, you give this power to others;

00:11:49.197 --> 00:11:51.624
you don't have to work it out.

00:11:51.825 --> 00:11:53.949
Just in your presence,

00:11:54.071 --> 00:11:56.758
people can get this power .

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:00.895
of complete satisfaction

00:12:01.096 --> 00:12:07.820
And there is salvation, for you and for others.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:14.810
So all the problems which are faced

00:12:14.865 --> 00:12:17.864
for the journey of ascent are finished

00:12:18.065 --> 00:12:26.823
and you [are or now] drenched in the bliss of heavenly

00:12:27.024 --> 00:12:31.789
peace and joy.

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:34.929
That's why it is called as Kaivalya,

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:39.781
means only, only the blessings.

00:12:39.982 --> 00:12:43.630
See that means there is no other word to translate it.

00:12:43.831 --> 00:12:47.027
There's no other way of explaining it.

00:12:47.094 --> 00:12:51.286
It's a state. It's a Stithi.

00:12:51.351 --> 00:12:53.725
It's a state, in that state you have to rise

00:12:53.926 --> 00:12:56.615
and you know that you are in that state.

00:12:56.816 --> 00:12:59.379
It's a very remarkable thing,

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:04.793
that once you reach that state you don't have to ask for anything.

00:13:04.863 --> 00:13:08.717
It's all there, and you are so satisfied.

00:13:08.918 --> 00:13:13.421
I can go on talking about this special power

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:18.967
but I think whatever I have said please meditate on that.

00:13:19.168 --> 00:13:22.934
And you are all capable of reaching that state.

00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:26.501
That state of complete peace and joy.

00:13:26.702 --> 00:13:29.881
May God bless you.
