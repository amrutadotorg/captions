1
00:00:00,801 --> 00:00:03,513
… in life.

2
00:00:03,714 --> 00:00:10,662
In the same way the vibrations, the
vibrations are coming, they are radiated.

3
00:00:10,863 --> 00:00:13,057
What you have to do is to expose yourself
to it.

4
00:00:13,258 --> 00:00:16,991
The best is not to put in any effort.

5
00:00:17,207 --> 00:00:19,758
Don’t worry at what point you have
a problem.

6
00:00:19,959 --> 00:00:21,973
Say, many people during meditation,
I have seen

7
00:00:22,173 --> 00:00:25,734
if they catch somewhere they go on looking
after it.

8
00:00:25,935 --> 00:00:29,300
You just don’t have to worry. You just let
it go

9
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:33,315
and it will work by itself.

10
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,002
Is going easy?

11
00:00:49,224 --> 00:00:52,501
So you don’t have to put in any effort.

12
00:00:52,702 --> 00:00:54,576
This is what meditation is.

13
00:00:54,784 --> 00:01:00,491
Meditation means exposing yourself
to God’s grace.

14
00:01:00,692 --> 00:01:03,958
Now the grace itself knows how to cure you.

15
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,727
It knows how to mend you, how to settle
down itself into your own being,

16
00:01:09,928 --> 00:01:15,669
keep your Spirit kindled. It knows
everything.

17
00:01:16,772 --> 00:01:21,866
So you don’t have to worry as to what
you have to do

18
00:01:22,067 --> 00:01:25,139
or what name you have to take, what mantras
you have to do.

19
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,387
In meditation you have to be absolutely
effortless,

20
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:33,343
[aside: “Sit down”], expose yourself fully

21
00:01:33,544 --> 00:01:39,201
and you have to be absolutely thoughtless
at that time.

22
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:43,682
Supposing there’s a possibility, you may
not be thoughtless.

23
00:01:43,883 --> 00:01:46,220
At that time you have to just watch
your thoughts,

24
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:48,544
but don’t get involved into them.

25
00:01:48,745 --> 00:01:54,599
You will find gradually as the sun rises,
the darkness goes away

26
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,000
and the sun’s rays go into every crevice
and every part

27
00:01:59,201 --> 00:02:03,456
and makes the whole place lighted.

28
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:06,873
In the same way your being will be
completely lighted.

29
00:02:07,074 --> 00:02:09,291
But if you put in an effort that time

30
00:02:09,491 --> 00:02:11,678
or try to stop something within you

31
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,238
or try to give it a bandhan
it will know.

32
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:20,255
Effortlessness is the only way
to meditation,

33
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,059
but you should not be lethargic about it –

34
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,061
should be alert and watch it.

35
00:02:26,262 --> 00:02:28,864
The other side could be people just
doze off.

36
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:33,360
No! You have to be alert. If you doze off,
nothing will work.

37
00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:39,711
That’s another side of it is. If you are
lazy about it, nothing will work.

38
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:48,083
You have to be alert and opened, absolutely
aware,

39
00:02:48,284 --> 00:02:53,049
completely effortless – absolutely
effortless.

40
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,730
If you are absolutely effortless,
meditation will work the best.

41
00:02:58,931 --> 00:03:01,493
Don’t think of your problems at all,

42
00:03:01,694 --> 00:03:04,399
whatever chakras you have, anything.

43
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,428
Just expose yourself.

44
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:12,020
See when the sun shines, all the nature
exposes itself to the sun

45
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:15,381
and receives the blessings of the sun,
effortlessly.

46
00:03:15,582 --> 00:03:19,667
It doesn’t put in any effort, it just
receives itself.

47
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:28,676
When it receives the sun’s rays, then the
sun’s ray’s start acting and activating.

48
00:03:31,562 --> 00:03:39,172
In the same way, the All-Pervading Power
starts working.

49
00:03:39,373 --> 00:03:42,983
You are not to manoeuvre it. You are not
to do anything about it.

50
00:03:43,184 --> 00:03:47,569
Just be effortless, absolutely effortless.

51
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,580
Don’t take any names. Do not bother
if your Agnya is catching,

52
00:03:51,781 --> 00:03:55,204
this is catching, that is catching. It is
working out.

53
00:03:55,405 --> 00:04:00,140
It will go on working as long as it can

54
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:07,488
and it will do the miracle that it has
to do. You don’t have to worry about it.

55
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:09,109
It knows its job.

56
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,542
But when you put in an effort actually
you create a barrier for it.

57
00:04:13,742 --> 00:04:15,993
So no effort is needed,

58
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,164
be absolutely effortless and say

59
00:04:18,364 --> 00:04:22,567
‘Let it go, let it go’ – that’s all.

60
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,559
No mantra’s to be chanted,

61
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,517
in case you find it’s impossible – then
you can take my name,

62
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:29,233
but there is no need even.

63
00:04:29,434 --> 00:04:31,334
When you put your hand towards me
that’s the mantra,

64
00:04:31,535 --> 00:04:35,437
sufficient, this gesture itself is
the mantra.

65
00:04:35,638 --> 00:04:42,805
You see there’s no need to say it more, but
the thought in the mind, the emotion

66
00:04:43,006 --> 00:04:48,134
should be that we have to now spread our
hands to that and it should work.

67
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:53,490
When this emotion is absolutely complete,

68
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:58,962
there is no need to say any mantra,
you go beyond it.

69
00:05:00,293 --> 00:05:02,732
So, one has to be absolutely effortless,

70
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:08,545
absolutely effortless. That is what it is.

71
00:05:16,243 --> 00:05:20,366
Meditation is for your own ascent,

72
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:25,635
is for your own capital gains that you
have to have.

73
00:05:25,836 --> 00:05:30,690
But once you get into it, you also achieve
your powers.

74
00:05:30,891 --> 00:05:35,553
Like, you become a governor then you get
the powers of the governor.

75
00:05:35,754 --> 00:05:39,513
At this time you don’t have to think about
anybody else.

76
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,620
You are not to put your attention
to anybody else

77
00:05:42,821 --> 00:05:46,957
but just receive it, just receive it.

78
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,754
Do not think of any other problem,

79
00:05:49,955 --> 00:05:57,788
but that, that you have to be effortless,
absolutely effortless.

80
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:10,055
It would work best on the people who are
just receiving it.

81
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,042
You have problems – that’s why you are
here,

82
00:06:13,243 --> 00:06:18,401
but you cannot solve them, they are to be
solved by Divine Power.

83
00:06:18,602 --> 00:06:23,886
This must be understood fully, that we
cannot solve our problems.

84
00:06:24,087 --> 00:06:31,427
It is beyond us to solve our problems.

85
00:06:31,628 --> 00:06:37,288
So leave it in the hands of the Divine
Power

86
00:06:37,489 --> 00:06:43,334
and expose yourself effortlessly,
absolutely effortlessly.

87
00:06:43,535 --> 00:06:49,246
Sit in comfort, and properly with both
the feet on the ground,

88
00:06:49,447 --> 00:06:53,656
with both the hands relaxed like this.

89
00:06:53,857 --> 00:06:56,857
Be comfortable, you should not be
uncomfortable at all.

90
00:06:57,058 --> 00:07:02,800
Be very comfortable, you see, because you
have to sit for quite some time.

91
00:07:05,618 --> 00:07:08,774
And you try to put your attention to me,
within yourself,

92
00:07:08,975 --> 00:07:11,984
if you can, to my Kundalini if you can.

93
00:07:12,185 --> 00:07:15,927
You can come into my Kundalini and it will
be done.

94
00:07:16,128 --> 00:07:20,408
Good, just like this, the hands should be
like this, straight.

95
00:07:26,853 --> 00:07:31,692
So effortlessness is the key word,
absolutely effortlessly,

96
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:37,912
whether you are meditating before me,
or before my photograph.
