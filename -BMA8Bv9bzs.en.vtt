00:24:47.498 --> 00:24:52.568
I’ve been telling them about something
which you need not know.

00:24:52.952 --> 00:24:55.708
I hope you didn’t understand.

00:24:59.348 --> 00:25:04.549
Sometimes I have to speak in English when
I want them not to know anything about you.

00:25:05.318 --> 00:25:07.329
It’s quite mutual.

00:25:07.808 --> 00:25:13.793
All right, so I’m sorry for this delay but
it so happened that they never told Me anything.

00:25:13.898 --> 00:25:16.983
I didn’t know that is such a beautiful place
is here.

00:25:17.058 --> 00:25:22.271
Otherwise I would never have taken you down
there for any problem because actually this

00:25:22.277 --> 00:25:24.811
is the one that’s also a problem.

00:25:24.927 --> 00:25:32.749
God willing Me, we may buy this place.

00:25:47.595 --> 00:25:56.606
So I must praise you for your patience and
for your sweetness about it that delays do

00:25:56.636 --> 00:26:00.946
not matter as long as we have the Pujas.

00:26:00.946 --> 00:26:08.735
I hope you all have rested very well and your
stomach must be also resting a little bit

00:26:08.735 --> 00:26:14.306
because you had a very severe type of an attack
of people who wanted to feed you and it was

00:26:14.306 --> 00:26:18.836
too much starting from Aurangabad to this
place.

00:26:18.836 --> 00:26:24.396
This is good once in a while to allow your
stomach to rest.

00:26:24.396 --> 00:26:33.436
Now, I don’t know what to tell you because
as it is you know that we have big plans,

00:26:33.436 --> 00:26:40.036
when we, and when I say “we” I mean the
Paramchaitanya and all the deities put together,

00:26:40.036 --> 00:26:42.616
to expand Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:42.616 --> 00:26:46.295
It’s not necessary how many things you give
Me.

00:26:46.295 --> 00:26:47.976
It’s not necessary at all.

00:26:47.976 --> 00:26:52.206
It’s not necessary how many of us are there.

00:26:52.206 --> 00:26:57.976
What's more important is how many people you
give realization to.

00:26:57.976 --> 00:27:00.706
And secondly, how are you?

00:27:00.706 --> 00:27:02.626
Have you evolved?

00:27:02.626 --> 00:27:12.656
Have you really become independent and you
can get rid of all your conditionings, your

00:27:12.656 --> 00:27:13.656
ego?

00:27:13.656 --> 00:27:17.256
And have you become a very mild, beautiful,
compassionate, collective personality?

00:27:17.256 --> 00:27:25.056
So it’s a question of introspection, seeing
ourselves.

00:27:25.056 --> 00:27:28.896
It’s very important.

00:27:28.896 --> 00:27:31.866
If we do not have a proper car we cannot drive.

00:27:31.866 --> 00:27:40.036
In the same way if our being is in a funny
situation then you cannot ascend; that’s

00:27:40.036 --> 00:27:41.036
a fact.

00:27:41.036 --> 00:27:55.826
So we have to understand that the amount we
enjoy everything is the sign how much we have

00:27:55.826 --> 00:28:00.066
achieved.

00:28:00.066 --> 00:28:04.666
If there’s a little cup then a very little
joy can go into it.

00:28:04.666 --> 00:28:08.776
But if there’s a large cup it gets much
more joy in it.

00:28:08.776 --> 00:28:14.546
But if it is like an ocean all the rivers
of joys fall into it.

00:28:14.546 --> 00:28:17.856
So it is the amount of enjoyment you have.

00:28:17.856 --> 00:28:20.886
Not fun, I mean enjoyment.

00:28:20.886 --> 00:28:27.606
I’m not saying frivolousness, cheapishness,
but a very majestic, deep enjoyment that you

00:28:27.606 --> 00:28:34.106
have within yourself, which just bubbles into
you, makes you very happy, and you don’t

00:28:34.106 --> 00:28:39.016
know why you are happy, just enjoying your
happiness.

00:28:39.016 --> 00:28:44.086
Then one has to say that you have really become
a Sahaja Yogi.

00:28:44.086 --> 00:28:46.226
And then, at that stage you want to share
it.

00:28:46.226 --> 00:28:47.795
Don’t you keep it to yourself.

00:28:47.795 --> 00:28:52.325
You’ll work very hard, do everything that
is possible under the sun.

00:28:52.325 --> 00:28:58.746
Your mind will think how to spread it, how
to give this joy to others.

00:28:58.746 --> 00:29:03.156
You won’t be happy unless and until you
communicate with others.

00:29:03.156 --> 00:29:11.115
So first you become the capitalist and then
you become a communist.

00:29:11.115 --> 00:29:16.066
So first thing is how far we are enjoying.

00:29:16.066 --> 00:29:23.395
Second is what have we got in our mind now,
how are we going to expand Sahaja Yoga outside.

00:29:23.395 --> 00:29:29.175
First, the light has to improve and automatically
the light has to spread.

00:29:29.175 --> 00:29:35.036
What is the relationships we have with ourselves,
which I have told you before also, don’t

00:29:35.036 --> 00:29:36.036
form groups.

00:29:36.036 --> 00:29:38.906
This is the country; that is the country.

00:29:38.906 --> 00:29:45.485
I would request you to change the buses and
put different people into the buses and let

00:29:45.485 --> 00:29:53.526
us see if they reach in one piece or not or
there is a big quarrel and a fight.

00:29:53.526 --> 00:29:59.096
If there is any quarrel or argument then drop
that person on the way and let him come by

00:29:59.096 --> 00:30:01.705
another bus.

00:30:01.705 --> 00:30:10.246
We don’t want argumentative spoiled sports
with us.

00:30:10.246 --> 00:30:13.135
So just put them on the ground, I tell you.

00:30:13.135 --> 00:30:17.596
And it’s a, it’s definitely, you must
know that I am telling you in the presence

00:30:17.596 --> 00:30:24.105
of everyone, anybody who is difficult just
ask him to get down here, “Please be here.

00:30:24.105 --> 00:30:29.045
Some bus will be coming and take you.”

00:30:29.045 --> 00:30:32.765
So try to find out who are the spoiled sports.

00:30:32.765 --> 00:30:36.996
Another thing is some people have developed
a habit of moving their neck a bit too much.

00:30:36.996 --> 00:30:39.846
Even in singing they move their neck so much,
then their body.

00:30:39.846 --> 00:30:42.735
You can move your body but not the neck.

00:30:42.735 --> 00:30:44.726
Neck should be moved with the body.

00:30:44.726 --> 00:30:46.686
Yesterday I had a problem with My liver.

00:30:46.686 --> 00:30:49.906
Then I thought you all have livers.

00:30:49.906 --> 00:30:53.825
But then it was Vishuddhi and Vishuddhi must
have come from the way you people move your

00:30:53.825 --> 00:30:54.825
neck.

00:30:54.825 --> 00:30:57.936
Like if you say, “Yes, yes, yes, yes.”

00:30:57.936 --> 00:31:03.586
Or if you don’t want to say also, if I’m
saying anything you’ll go on like this,

00:31:03.586 --> 00:31:04.586
nodding.

00:31:04.586 --> 00:31:05.586
So don’t do all these things.

00:31:05.586 --> 00:31:06.586
That spoils your Vishuddhi.

00:31:06.586 --> 00:31:13.005
As it is you have bad Vishuddhis, thanks to
this Roman Catholic Church and the other church

00:31:13.005 --> 00:31:15.365
which just talks.

00:31:15.365 --> 00:31:22.306
So please try to keep your neck in line with
your body all the time and even if you have

00:31:22.306 --> 00:31:27.466
to move, move very slightly your neck, not
with jerks, and don’t go on nodding.

00:31:27.466 --> 00:31:30.947
While music time I’ve seen many people do
not move their body.

00:31:30.947 --> 00:31:37.026
But if you see the Indians, they move their
body.

00:31:37.026 --> 00:31:41.095
So this is one of a very small thing but is
important because your Vishuddhis have to

00:31:41.095 --> 00:31:42.205
be all right.

00:31:42.205 --> 00:31:44.615
There should be no problem on your Vishuddhis.

00:31:44.615 --> 00:31:50.955
For liver also, there are some people I see
still with liver who are very thin people.

00:31:50.955 --> 00:32:01.545
They should be asked to stand in the water
for one hour and clear out themselves.

00:32:01.545 --> 00:32:04.015
If you are very thin, be sure it is not a
normal thing.

00:32:04.015 --> 00:32:07.026
It is not natural.

00:32:07.026 --> 00:32:09.735
It is abnormal to be very thin.

00:32:09.735 --> 00:32:15.746
So work it out ‒ it’s all your liver ‒ and
later on you can have a session of checking

00:32:15.746 --> 00:32:17.955
yourselves somewhere sitting.

00:32:17.955 --> 00:32:22.505
Before meditation you can check yourselves
what is wrong with you before My photograph

00:32:22.505 --> 00:32:25.265
and then you should go into meditation.

00:32:25.265 --> 00:32:29.937
So now we are here on a pilgrimage to achieve
a higher state of awareness.

00:32:29.937 --> 00:32:35.035
Awareness is the main point, you should be
absolutely aware.

00:32:35.035 --> 00:32:43.496
As we were coming, I just said, “Now, this
is wrong road.”

00:32:43.496 --> 00:32:44.836
They said, “How do you know Mother?”

00:32:44.836 --> 00:32:46.925
I said, “Just I know.

00:32:46.925 --> 00:32:49.785
Just find out.”

00:32:49.785 --> 00:32:54.836
Just to know everything you need not do anything
about it.

00:32:54.836 --> 00:32:58.355
But that is the sign that you have become
very aware.

00:32:58.355 --> 00:33:06.086
To be aware of everything, it is not like
sitting down here that you should say, “Oh,

00:33:06.086 --> 00:33:07.476
it’s very beautiful.

00:33:07.476 --> 00:33:09.336
Oh, it’s very grand.”

00:33:09.336 --> 00:33:14.576
That’s not the point ‒ not to certify,
not to criticize ‒ but how much do you know.

00:33:14.576 --> 00:33:18.856
Feel it in the atmosphere.

00:33:18.856 --> 00:33:25.796
Because we have a very big brain and we have
two loops in our head, is not one brain but

00:33:25.796 --> 00:33:26.935
two loops.

00:33:26.935 --> 00:33:37.096
And when the awareness starts giving you light
you start knowing within yourself everything

00:33:37.096 --> 00:33:41.146
and you are silent.

00:33:41.146 --> 00:33:50.446
You don’t have to assert, manipulate or
to exert yourself but just to know.

00:33:50.446 --> 00:33:54.526
And that’s a very beautiful thing one has
to do.

00:33:54.526 --> 00:34:01.226
Those people who do not feel vibrations must
feel their vibrations in these two.

00:34:01.226 --> 00:34:05.625
They have to feel their vibrations in these
two.

00:34:05.625 --> 00:34:12.795
And those who are still complaining about
their troubles and stomachs and livers and

00:34:12.795 --> 00:34:24.286
this and that should get treated immediately
and get well.

00:34:24.286 --> 00:34:29.735
Another thing which I can tell you which is
very important that in India you must comb

00:34:29.735 --> 00:34:33.276
you properly because they think you are all
beggars.

00:34:33.276 --> 00:34:35.786
Only the beggars have hair like this.

00:34:35.786 --> 00:34:38.826
Please put oil and make your hair properly.

00:34:38.826 --> 00:34:42.245
They’ll not have any respect for you.

00:34:42.245 --> 00:34:46.386
You must have properly combed hair, groomed
hair.

00:34:46.386 --> 00:34:50.055
Otherwise they think you are something mad,
or you are hippies or something gone wrong

00:34:50.055 --> 00:34:51.055
with you.

00:34:51.055 --> 00:34:53.326
They don’t appreciate this fashion.

00:34:53.326 --> 00:35:00.305
Please make your hair properly, absolutely
in a proper way as they used to do.

00:35:00.305 --> 00:35:06.295
When we saw your western pictures when we
were young, they all were very well-groomed

00:35:06.295 --> 00:35:07.295
people.

00:35:07.295 --> 00:35:13.696
Now suddenly this fashion stupid has come
to make you all bald-headed and then to sell

00:35:13.696 --> 00:35:17.995
their ‒ what you call them ‒ wigs.

00:35:17.995 --> 00:35:20.755
So this stupid idea is wrong.

00:35:20.755 --> 00:35:27.276
Will you please now see that your hair are
properly groomed and not to have any hair

00:35:27.276 --> 00:35:29.425
on your, this thing.

00:35:29.425 --> 00:35:33.086
It’s a sign of stupidity in this country.

00:35:33.086 --> 00:35:37.926
Anybody has, who has hair on the forehead
it’s a sign of stupidity.

00:35:37.926 --> 00:35:44.245
We call it as “giprya”.

00:35:44.245 --> 00:35:46.276
I asked Neeta what is the fashion now.

00:35:46.276 --> 00:35:48.625
She told Me in Marathi it is “giprya”.

00:35:48.625 --> 00:35:55.776
“Giprya” means a person who gets mad or
lunatic as the hair, hair you see like that.

00:35:55.776 --> 00:35:58.805
At least we Sahaja Yogis should not follow
such stupid fashions.

00:35:58.805 --> 00:36:02.886
They now take out hair like this, you see.

00:36:02.886 --> 00:36:10.005
I just don’t know, like moustaches coming
out of the head.

00:36:10.005 --> 00:36:13.526
You should be proud of your forehead.

00:36:13.526 --> 00:36:17.766
It’s the Ekadesha.

00:36:17.766 --> 00:36:23.736
You have to fight the whole world with this
Ekadesha of yours.

00:36:23.736 --> 00:36:30.966
So please see that you keep your forehead
absolutely open, hair properly done and oily.

00:36:30.966 --> 00:36:31.966
That will also soothe you.

00:36:31.966 --> 00:36:35.505
In the night you can put some oil and it will
soothe you.

00:36:35.505 --> 00:36:39.605
You’ll find it very much better; specially
for liver patient is very important.

00:36:39.605 --> 00:36:44.276
They must put oil in their heads because they
are dried out people.

00:36:44.276 --> 00:36:47.836
There’s no fat in their hair and the hair
do not grow.

00:36:47.836 --> 00:36:54.625
They become immediately bald as soon as they
achieve twenty-five to thirty years of age.

00:36:54.625 --> 00:37:00.706
I don’t want to have bald-headed Sahaja
Yogis.

00:37:00.706 --> 00:37:07.196
Otherwise you’ll have to wear the [shadings]
like the Hare Rama Hare Krishna.

00:37:07.196 --> 00:37:14.255
If you make such clownish appearances I’m
worried about you because you don’t see

00:37:14.255 --> 00:37:17.296
the point what I am trying to make.

00:37:17.296 --> 00:37:23.326
Look after your hair; it’s very important.

00:37:23.326 --> 00:37:34.315
All right, now last but not the least is a
request that we are here for meditation.

00:37:34.315 --> 00:37:37.685
Though we may sleep late I always get up at
four o’clock.

00:37:37.685 --> 00:37:40.226
Whatever time you may sleep, get up at four
o’clock, do your meditation.

00:37:40.226 --> 00:37:42.485
You can go after to sleep again.

00:37:42.485 --> 00:37:47.346
But that’s the best time to get up, have
your baths, whatever way you want, or wash

00:37:47.346 --> 00:37:51.115
yourself and just go for meditation.

00:37:51.115 --> 00:37:52.865
And then you can sleep off again.

00:37:52.865 --> 00:37:56.156
That time you will find you will be quite
alert and awake.

00:37:56.156 --> 00:37:59.236
It’s not so difficult.

00:37:59.236 --> 00:38:02.326
You’ll all be awakened.

00:38:02.326 --> 00:38:03.865
I will awaken you.

00:38:03.865 --> 00:38:09.446
But please see that you get up in the morning,
do your meditation from four to five and then

00:38:09.446 --> 00:38:14.156
go off to sleep.

00:38:14.156 --> 00:38:17.875
We have to write a book about the Sahaj culture.

00:38:17.875 --> 00:38:20.836
But it is going to come out of you people.

00:38:20.836 --> 00:38:26.486
If I write something then I am manipulating
you, I’m trying to tell you, but you have

00:38:26.486 --> 00:38:29.896
to write something yourself.

00:38:29.896 --> 00:38:33.926
You have to bring out what is Sahaj culture
is.

00:38:33.926 --> 00:38:39.456
You are already manifesting it without My
telling you now.

00:38:39.456 --> 00:38:44.526
So what is the Sahaj culture, how we work
it out, ourselves, our things ‒ I don’t

00:38:44.526 --> 00:38:48.196
tell you all these things into details.

00:38:48.196 --> 00:38:55.795
Also, try to judge where is your attention,
what are you doing about your attention.

00:38:55.795 --> 00:38:59.326
All the time keep an attention on your attention.

00:38:59.326 --> 00:39:01.495
Where is my attention?

00:39:01.495 --> 00:39:06.065
Mr. Attention, where are you lost?

00:39:06.065 --> 00:39:07.675
And that will work out for you.

00:39:07.675 --> 00:39:09.776
So now for today it’s sufficient.

00:39:09.776 --> 00:39:15.516
Already we are very late and I hope My lecture
doesn’t go over your heads or on the sides

00:39:15.516 --> 00:39:16.576
of your ears.

00:39:16.576 --> 00:39:22.157
It should go inside and you should record
it and whatever I am saying it’s very important.

00:39:22.526 --> 00:39:24.706
May God bless you all.
