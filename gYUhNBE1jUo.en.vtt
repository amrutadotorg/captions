00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.400
But today I'm going to tell you something more

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.760
which we have to know.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:29.240
It's very important to know, because 
as was described by people

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:36.680
that they practice Sahaja Yoga as they go to church,

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.120
but it's not from their heart.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.400
And heart is the abode of the spirit

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.640
- is the Shiva within us.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:01.640
So we have to know more about heart, and 
that is very important.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.120
You know about these three nadis we have: 
Ida, Pingala, Sushumna;

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.240
but in the heart there are four nadis.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.840
And the one nadi goes to Mooladhara,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.000
and if you cross the limits of Mooladhara it goes to hell.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.800
That's why they say that Shiva is a destroyer.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.480
Actually you ask for your destruction.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.960
And when you ask for your destruction, you have it.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.600
Even if it destroys everything, as I was telling,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.960
it's like when a fruit has to come,

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.080
the petals look as if they're destroyed

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.400
- as I have destroyed, I would say, many of your things:

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.000
you can call it like your conditionings,

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.680
your ego, your racialism, your fanaticism.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.800
All this has been destroyed in Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.320
This has to be destroyed

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.000
for the beauty to come out.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.800
So when your maryadas

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.560
you cross beyond certain point,

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.000
you go to your destruction.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.200
In four directions there are destructions built,

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.760
as there are four nadis.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.280
So now, what is to be done?

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.840
How are we to stop this destruction of the,

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.440
through the first nadi, going to hell?

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.080
One of the qualities of Shiva is that He's innocence.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.480
He's extremely innocent. He's innocent like a child.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.680
He is innocence personified.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.880
So

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:27.200
we have to put our carnal desires,

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.560
dissolve them,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.680
dissolve them into the innocence,

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.960
the ocean of innocence.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.200
You have to dissolve it in the ocean of innocence.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.600
Innocence is something to be appreciated,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.480
to be understood, to be enjoyed.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.000
Like you see animals, they're innocent;

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.640
you see children, they're innocent;

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.840
flowers, they're innocent.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.320
Divert your attention

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.160
to all these things.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.000
You see, on walking on the street,

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.720
what is there to see best

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.440
is all at three feet height.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.720
You see at three feet height all the flowers,

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.160
all the beautiful grass,

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.440
all the children who are about three feet are the best.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.960
You need not see people who are above that.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.240
Just see on three feet level.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:12.400
You can see the legs of somebody, that's all right.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.440
But you don't see the eyes of a person

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.240
who are not innocent.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.640
So dissolve this desire

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.320
into innocence.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.440
And this Mooladhara which is innocent

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.840
is not dead, finished, but is innocent,

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.040
it is righteous,

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.920
it is Shri Ganesha's qualities,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.120
it's pure.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.600
So even if you are in this world, even 
if you are living like a human being,

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.840
even if you have children,

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.360
still you are innocent.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.160
The second nadi, the second channel

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.760
that can take you to destruction is desire.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.800
That's why Buddha has said that desirelessness

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.360
is the only way that people do not get old,

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.640
nor sick, nor worried.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.160
Now this desire that we have,

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.760
"I want this,"

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.800
in the West is much more than anywhere else

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.360
because the entrepreneurs are every day 
producing new things.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.080
Desires can be of any kind, not only material.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.280
The desires could be also

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.680
quite mental,

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.120
"I must possess this woman,

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.560
I must possess this child."

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:12.480
All kinds of possessions that work into you as desires.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.120
But I wouldn't say it is because of attachment.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:25.080
It's not attachment, but it is just to have more.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:36.480
Go on adding up things, getting things

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:45.280
- still one doesn't feel happy and satisfied.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.080
What is the reason

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.520
for this kind of a desire is that it's not pure desire.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.800
It's an impure desire.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:02.160
It's an impure desire,and when such a desire starts working

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.520
you can go any far,

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.920
like Saddam Hussein, like Hitler, like anything

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.240
is nothing but absolutely desire beyond

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.600
any limitations.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.680
You want to dominate others

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.600
is also another desire.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.480
All these desires

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:36.760
lead you ultimately to a destruction,

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:43.400
because there's no joy, there's no happiness.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.120
For example, now I want to have a sari,

00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:01.400
so I want to buy a sari. All my attention will be 
how will I get that sari,

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:08.680
I must get that sari, this thing, that thing. 
The attention becomes polluted,

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.600
disturbed, for a nonsensical thing like a sari.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.680
The attention which has to enjoy,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.360
which has to enjoy the spirit,

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.800
which has to nourish the spirit,

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:32.840
becomes disturbed because of desires.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.160
In the first place the attention

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.280
is disturbed because we are not innocent.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.880
In the second place the attention

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:53.440
gets into turmoil because we have desire.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:03.520
So what should we do as far as the desire is concerned?

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.240
The desire for beautiful things

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:19.280
- we can shift our desire, material desire into aesthetics,

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:25.360
and have one thing but which is really aesthetically rich;

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:33.040
So whatever you desire, if you start working it out,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:41.280
desiring for something aesthetically handmade, nice thing,

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:49.640
gradually you'll find you'll end up with vibrations,

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:54.640
because all beautiful things have vibrations.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:02.000
And to have the vibrations you'll have to go to pure desire.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.360
So this desire which is madness,

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:13.680
which makes you mad, which is so much dull and boring

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:19.840
becomes pure desire, because you have to dissolve

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.280
all your desires into vibration.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:27.120
You start desiring nothing but vibrations after some time.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:34.320
So if you have vibrations that doesn't mean that they are 
something dry, you see?

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.520
No,

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:41.320
it means the joy of bhakti.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.280
Bhakti is, you can call it adoration, this, that.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:52.400
It's the ocean of love that is God.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:59.920
You just get drenched into it. There's no words to it.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:07.280
And that is what when you feel, you must know that

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.360
you have taken the spirit

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:17.160
as a real connection

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:22.680
between you and your Mother,

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.800
or your Father.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:32.760
There's no differentiation.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.520
You are one

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.800
in that ocean, drenched in the ocean.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.000
You are the drop, you are the ocean.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:49.040
You are one in that bhakti.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:54.320
And that bhakti cannot be mechanical,

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:01.120
because not man-made.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:08.080
So to enjoy Sahaja Yoga

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:13.000
you must know that it's not dry vibrations only,

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.520
but is the bhakti.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.600
That is the joy

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:29.000
of Shiva's quality, the quality of joy 
that He adds to our life.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:34.040
Everything seems to be surrounded, resounding.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.480
Same thing the joy,

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.560
that "I'm loved so much by God,

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.920
that God loves me,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.920
that I have a meaning in life."

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:51.400
Then the ego drops out first of all,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.480
and also the conditionings drop out.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:06.440
Now the third nadi:

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:18.600
third nadi is the nadi by which we feel attached,

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.840
attached to someone.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:27.760
Like this is my child, this is my husband,

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:33.120
this is my family, this is my wife,

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:37.800
this is my father, this is my mother.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:43.000
In the beginning of Sahaja Yoga of everyone,

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.720
when they are just the beginners,

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:52.200
so they talk about their whole family,

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.840
"My father is like this,

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.080
my mother is sick, my mother's sister's brother's

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:02.320
this, that's real, this thing, is not well."

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:08.240
As if, you see, we all have taken a contract.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.600
What should I do?

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:17.400
So now this so-called limited love,

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.880
what is the solution which takes you to destruction

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.080
is the unlimited love.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:30.560
Because Shiva is nothing but love, He's love.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:39.360
Love is that corrects, that nourishes,

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.200
that wants your benevolence.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:50.800
That's what Shiva is. It wants your benevolence.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.880
It looks after your benevolence.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.640
So when

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:07.320
you are looking after the benevolence of others with love,

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.840
then the whole life changes,

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.920
the whole pattern changes,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.080
and you really enjoy it because you become one with so many,

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.160
concerned with so many families, so many things,

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.520
so many problems of others,

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.600
and you just feel you are one with so many.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:40.440
All this is the most enjoyable thing.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.160
I mean, why all this is for there?

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:50.240
After all, think about yourself, "Why am I here?

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:55.600
I'm here to enjoy everyone - everyone.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.000
They are all realized souls,

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.320
such beautiful lotuses.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.320
I'm not going to stoop down to the mud.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:11.200
Now I am a lotus."

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:19.080
That is the way you open the heart,

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.840
the lotus of your heart.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:29.720
And the fragrance of such a person is so beautiful,

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.480
is so beautiful.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.840
So you are no more divisive,

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.640
you do not want to separate from each other.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:46.040
Anywhere is done, you are agreeable to that;

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:51.400
you don't think that it should be done here 
or there or there, but anywhere

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:56.080
- but should be all of us together.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:02.320
So the small attachments that are with you

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:09.080
have to be dissolved into this ocean of love, 
which is Shiva.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:21.760
Fourth one is the most important for all of us is to know

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.200
that there's a nadi which passes through left Vishuddhi

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.920
into the heart.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.360
Starts from the heart, goes up,

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.640
passes through Agnya.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:39.720
It has four petals and opens up.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.080
This is the one which gives

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.200
you the state which is called as turya.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:56.400
We live in three states.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:00.280
In the living - in the awakened state,

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:04.680
jagruti, our attention goes to this, that, and all that;

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.640
we spoil our attention.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:16.320
But the second one is the one what we call is that we sleep.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:20.280
When we sleep also

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:26.840
all these things that have happened come to us 
from our past and things like that.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.560
But then we go to the deeper sleep called as sushupti.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:40.400
Is a state whereyou have deep sleep,

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:45.280
and you dream of something that is reality also.

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:49.000
You may dream about Me.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:54.080
Like it's the ethereal part of the subconscious,

00:19:54.160 --> 00:20:00.400
where some beautiful informations are passed on.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.080
Supposing I've come, say, to Italy.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:09.800
Italians might know in their sushupti that I have 
come here, or maybe anybody might know - depends on.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.800
But the fourth state is called as turya. 
There ar two more states.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:18.160
You are in the turya state, it's the fourth, 
"turya" means fourth.

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:22.200
Fourth state is where that you are

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.360
in a thoughtless awareness state.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.400
When there is no thought - just think of it

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:37.680
- when there is no thought, you have to be innocent.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:43.160
When there is no thought, you have to have vibrations.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:48.080
When there is no thought, you cannot be attached to anyone.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:52.680
So into that thoughtless state you have come now, 
is the "turya sthiti"

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:57.120
and in this state when you are,

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:02.560
these four petals which are within you

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:07.400
have to open out in your brain.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:13.960
They come from your heart to your brain.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:20.120
And that is when

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:29.080
you absolutely understand what is God,

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:38.400
absolutely you know what is God is.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.840
That is the time when

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:51.920
one receives the real knowledge.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:04.000
But unless and until these four petals open, 
one may fall back,

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.120
and that's why some of the Sahaja yogis

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:12.200
who are still meddling with things

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:16.080
that they should not do, go down.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:21.160
And they don't understand what is God is.

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:27.200
But it's not the understanding - in a way you 
understand this one little point,

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:31.520
that it comes from your heart into your brain,

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:36.160
not from brain to your heart.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:43.920
It comes as if the ambrosia of

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:49.920
your bhakti covers your brain, absolutely.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:54.480
I wish you all to achieve that state.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.840
May God bless you.
