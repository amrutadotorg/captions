00:06:58.588 --> 00:07:03.457
Today we are celebrating the birth of Christ,

00:07:08.113 --> 00:07:12.504
which was a very big event in the realm of human awareness.

00:07:12.705 --> 00:07:18.667
As you know that when He is born in the Agnya chakra

00:07:19.074 --> 00:07:22.554
He sucks the ego and superego,

00:07:22.807 --> 00:07:29.144
that is the conditioning within us and our ego.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:37.394
Such a great happening has taken place, about 2000 years back.

00:07:37.712 --> 00:07:41.549
But today is the time for us to use, utilize

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.833
that great Advent on this earth.

00:07:47.011 --> 00:07:50.615
To understand Christ first of all we have to know

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:55.304
that He was just nothing but Omkara.

00:07:56.425 --> 00:08:01.286
He was just made of vibrations

00:08:01.792 --> 00:08:04.995
and that is why He was resurrected.

00:08:05.207 --> 00:08:10.862
And He was detached because of His very nature.

00:08:12.419 --> 00:08:18.911
And so we too have to understand

00:08:19.112 --> 00:08:24.157
that we have to be detached,

00:08:24.358 --> 00:08:27.291
first from our thoughts,

00:08:27.492 --> 00:08:30.814
and that as you know is achieved

00:08:31.015 --> 00:08:33.511
if you know how to forgive others.

00:08:33.712 --> 00:08:38.138
But there is another very subtle attachment people have

00:08:38.339 --> 00:08:41.131
that those who are born in Christian religion

00:08:41.332 --> 00:08:44.407
think that Christ is their own

00:08:44.608 --> 00:08:46.805
and that He resides in their pocket.

00:08:47.006 --> 00:08:49.182
On the contrary it's just the other way round,

00:08:49.383 --> 00:08:51.364
that He has nothing to do with them

00:08:51.565 --> 00:08:53.084
and He is against them.

00:08:53.285 --> 00:08:56.578
As Christ has said "You will be calling Me, `Christ, Christ`

00:08:56.779 --> 00:08:58.395
and I will not know you".

00:08:58.596 --> 00:09:02.569
So it is important that Christians should never think

00:09:02.847 --> 00:09:06.373
that, "Christ is our own and that He is ours",

00:09:06.574 --> 00:09:09.220
because all your life you have lived like Christians.

00:09:09.464 --> 00:09:12.374
Actually you have not; you have not lived like Christians.

00:09:12.575 --> 00:09:14.534
So those who have not lived like Christians,

00:09:14.735 --> 00:09:16.715
only have taken the name of Christianity

00:09:16.916 --> 00:09:21.181
are not in the real sense the people who follow Christ.

00:09:21.382 --> 00:09:26.245
So now we have to change ourselves and follow Him in our lives.

00:09:26.446 --> 00:09:30.019
Unless and until we imbibe Him in our lives

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.844
we have not understood

00:09:34.045 --> 00:09:38.579
the greatness of His advent.

00:09:39.512 --> 00:09:43.654
Just because we are Christians or so-called Christians,

00:09:43.878 --> 00:09:46.965
to believe we have much to do about Him

00:09:47.166 --> 00:09:48.936
and to be identified with Him

00:09:49.137 --> 00:09:51.086
is absolutely wrong.

00:09:51.287 --> 00:09:53.290
And that's what I warned you before

00:09:53.491 --> 00:09:58.165
that we have to imbibe all His qualities.

00:09:58.785 --> 00:10:02.412
It was a living example of a very great Advent.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:07.577
that He came on this earth and led such a pure and a holy life.

00:10:08.229 --> 00:10:11.303
Try to develop your purity and holiness

00:10:11.504 --> 00:10:15.659
and a powerful holiness and a powerful auspiciousness

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:19.370
which does not get contaminated, but fights

00:10:19.571 --> 00:10:23.290
whatever is anti-God, whatever is anti-Christ.

00:10:24.102 --> 00:10:30.342
So today is a day when we are celebrating His birthday again

00:10:31.402 --> 00:10:33.846
and on this day let Him be born within us

00:10:34.089 --> 00:10:36.533
let Him be born in our character,

00:10:36.734 --> 00:10:39.865
in our behavior, in our temperament.

00:10:40.089 --> 00:10:44.022
He was a detached man, not attached to material things,

00:10:44.223 --> 00:10:47.756
nothing of the kind; He lived like a carpenter’s son,

00:10:47.957 --> 00:10:51.799
in a very uncomfortable life, absolutely.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.295
And He never bothered about small things of life.

00:10:55.496 --> 00:10:57.605
Actually, you know, a carpenter's house

00:10:57.806 --> 00:11:01.227
is one of the most dangerous places to live in

00:11:01.457 --> 00:11:03.465
because you have all kinds of nails,

00:11:03.666 --> 00:11:09.311
you have all kinds of funny types of instruments that you use.

00:11:09.527 --> 00:11:13.376
Any day you can topple onto anything and can get hurt.

00:11:13.577 --> 00:11:16.321
And there is hardly any place where you can sleep.

00:11:16.522 --> 00:11:18.599
The whole place is filled with wood

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.071
and people mostly sleep on wood.

00:11:21.272 --> 00:11:24.256
But just the other way round, we, the so-called Christians

00:11:24.439 --> 00:11:27.743
are so particular about our comfort.

00:11:27.944 --> 00:11:30.187
And it's very easy for us to condemn others

00:11:30.388 --> 00:11:33.705
it's very easy, it's something so absurd. I mean it's so absurd!

00:11:33.906 --> 00:11:37.833
You see anything - they'll go, say
to a market place, "Oh it's horrid",

00:11:38.034 --> 00:11:42.458
they'll go to some place and say, "That’s bad". What about you?

00:11:43.278 --> 00:11:46.323
What is within yourself?

00:11:46.951 --> 00:11:48.544
Just see within yourself.

00:11:48.745 --> 00:11:51.462
And this is the thing we have to develop now,

00:11:51.663 --> 00:11:53.966
we have to cleanse ourselves from within.

00:11:54.199 --> 00:11:56.873
You have to be uncomfortable with yourself

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.649
nothing without.

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:02.918
We have to be uncomfortable with what bad things we have within ourselves

00:12:03.119 --> 00:12:04.320
and not from without.

00:12:04.521 --> 00:12:06.883
Take your attention from outside inward,

00:12:07.084 --> 00:12:10.579
as Christ lived a life which was inward.

00:12:10.792 --> 00:12:14.571
He was not living outside. He was living inside Himself.

00:12:14.816 --> 00:12:18.138
And that is what we have to today understand, on this day,

00:12:18.339 --> 00:12:21.241
that our new birth should take us inward.

00:12:21.442 --> 00:12:23.612
Our worry should be for our inward comfort

00:12:23.813 --> 00:12:25.418
and not for outward comfort.

00:12:25.619 --> 00:12:27.809
Like yesterday, if you didn’t like the picture,

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:30.378
it's a good sign, that you can’t live with dirt and filth.

00:12:30.579 --> 00:12:32.185
But that is still outside.

00:12:32.368 --> 00:12:34.483
But what about the inward dirt and filth?

00:12:34.684 --> 00:12:37.918
What about the inward thoughts that are contaminating us?

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:43.308
What about the silly ideas that are still on our heads?

00:12:43.541 --> 00:12:47.034
Take them away, throw them away and be again born

00:12:47.217 --> 00:12:48.927
like the lotus starts,

00:12:49.128 --> 00:12:50.940
like Christ,

00:12:51.214 --> 00:12:55.954
who all His life lived like this, died for us and was resurrected.

00:12:56.886 --> 00:12:58.943
So we have such a great example

00:12:59.144 --> 00:13:02.509
to be imbibed within ourselves, in our character, in our lives.

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:06.372
This is I am saying again and again, because we really get confused.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:11.726
We think if we have a sort of a passport,

00:13:13.138 --> 00:13:16.047
we are all right. No that is not so.

00:13:16.248 --> 00:13:20.335
It's the becoming within yourself of Christ like behavior.

00:13:20.536 --> 00:13:24.560
And the greatest of all is forgiving,

00:13:24.871 --> 00:13:26.614
the forgiveness,

00:13:26.815 --> 00:13:30.795
the forgiveness which is so lacking in us, you see.

00:13:30.996 --> 00:13:35.221
Unless and until we develop that... This ego has to go away.

00:13:35.422 --> 00:13:38.857
If you have to be Christians, you have to be egoless.

00:13:39.501 --> 00:13:42.552
And that's what one has to understand

00:13:42.753 --> 00:13:47.994
that when we talk of Christ's birth - such a beautiful time -

00:13:48.195 --> 00:13:50.783
though he was born in complete discomfort.

00:13:50.984 --> 00:13:53.230
He could have born in a king’s place.

00:13:53.464 --> 00:13:55.770
He could have born anywhere. But why he did it?

00:13:55.971 --> 00:13:58.299
Because He knew that when Christians will come

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.529
they will seek the best beds for themselves,

00:14:02.171 --> 00:14:04.458
the best houses for themselves,

00:14:04.659 --> 00:14:06.892
and little bit here and there they won’t tolerate.

00:14:07.093 --> 00:14:09.651
They will be shouting for little things: a carpet is spoiled,

00:14:09.852 --> 00:14:12.973
this is spoiled and it's so low minded.

00:14:15.608 --> 00:14:21.769
So for you it is important that you must rise higher,

00:14:22.459 --> 00:14:26.679
higher and see how He was born in a manger,

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.773
in a such uncomfortable place

00:14:28.944 --> 00:14:31.877
where there were all kinds of cows and cow dung

00:14:32.078 --> 00:14:33.902
and everything was spread there

00:14:34.103 --> 00:14:36.896
and He just didn’t bother.

00:14:37.136 --> 00:14:39.885
He just got His birth in a place

00:14:40.086 --> 00:14:44.156
which you would not like to even visit or to sit there.

00:14:45.044 --> 00:14:48.089
And the mother cleaned the whole thing for Him

00:14:48.355 --> 00:14:50.008
and He was born there,

00:14:50.209 --> 00:14:55.876
a sparkling star of the heavens, to cleanse everything.

00:14:56.136 --> 00:15:01.860
Because if you are clean, you clean others.

00:15:04.128 --> 00:15:09.568
So this today, the great day of His advent

00:15:09.769 --> 00:15:15.086
let us celebrate in this great country of yoga,

00:15:15.287 --> 00:15:20.480
specially this bhoomi of Pune, which is the punya-bhoomi,

00:15:21.133 --> 00:15:24.792
that the auspiciousness, the holiness,

00:15:24.993 --> 00:15:31.980
and the complete detached temperament of Christ

00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:34.567
we are going to imbibe within ourselves

00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:42.082
and we are going to live like real followers of Christ and His life.

00:15:42.964 --> 00:15:46.328
Today you are Sahaja Yogis, so you have no caste, no custom,

00:15:46.597 --> 00:15:49.145
you have, you have no religion now.

00:15:49.394 --> 00:15:53.461
Now you have only one universal religion that is Sahaja Yoga

00:15:53.662 --> 00:15:58.111
and yet, there Christ is worshipped, everybody worships Christ

00:15:58.312 --> 00:16:02.085
because He came not for one person, 2 persons or 10 persons.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:09.496
But those who worship Him, must express His character, His life.

00:16:09.697 --> 00:16:13.373
Like materialists, how can they talk
of Christ I just can’t understand,

00:16:13.574 --> 00:16:16.005
because there was no material thing in His body.

00:16:16.206 --> 00:16:19.673
He had no matter in Him. He was just vibrations.

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:22.228
That is how He walked on the water.

00:16:22.452 --> 00:16:26.265
So how can materialists ever claim anything about Christ,

00:16:26.466 --> 00:16:28.294
I can’t understand.

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:33.078
This is the problem one faces when one sees,

00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:37.692
how we are juxtaposition of what we proclaim.

00:16:41.644 --> 00:16:45.058
Now this is the part which we have to achieve,

00:16:45.285 --> 00:16:49.042
and once you achieve it, you will be amazed,

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:53.393
that God looks after you.

00:16:54.964 --> 00:16:59.605
How a flower flourishes in the wilderness?

00:17:01.183 --> 00:17:04.247
How it gets its water?

00:17:04.446 --> 00:17:08.045
How it is looked after? How it is so beautiful?

00:17:08.246 --> 00:17:10.442
It is not bothered.

00:17:10.643 --> 00:17:13.852
In the same way, when you become

00:17:14.125 --> 00:17:17.938
that beautiful being which is the Spirit,

00:17:18.139 --> 00:17:22.339
you are looked after, you get all the blessings, all the joy,

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:26.841
because the source of joy is that, absolutely.

00:17:27.042 --> 00:17:31.671
But when you cover it with your ego, that joy you cannot get.

00:17:31.872 --> 00:17:34.722
So just try to clean that ego somehow.

00:17:34.941 --> 00:17:38.197
See your ego, "Oh, Mr. Ego, you are there. Get out."

00:17:38.456 --> 00:17:40.677
Take it out. With affection,

00:17:40.878 --> 00:17:43.338
with kindness towards yourself and towards others,

00:17:43.558 --> 00:17:49.113
try to rise, rise higher and higher

00:17:49.322 --> 00:17:52.375
into that realm which Christ has created for us,

00:17:52.628 --> 00:17:57.383
in the limbic area where it is the kingdom of God.

00:18:00.585 --> 00:18:03.272
May God bless you all that you follow His life

00:18:03.473 --> 00:18:07.388
and you imbibe all His qualities within yourself.

00:18:08.082 --> 00:18:10.281
I am also your Mother

00:18:10.464 --> 00:18:13.446
And I am here to teach you all those things

00:18:13.647 --> 00:18:15.661
and to tell you how to do it.

00:18:15.862 --> 00:18:17.888
And you have to see to it. How?

00:18:18.089 --> 00:18:21.145
I am detached. In the same way, try to be detached.

00:18:21.363 --> 00:18:24.305
You try to please Me by giving Me this and that

00:18:24.506 --> 00:18:26.420
but you know I am a very detached person,

00:18:26.621 --> 00:18:30.330
I don’t understand attachment, I don’t understand attachment.

00:18:30.531 --> 00:18:34.399
And I just sometimes smile at people when they try to say,

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.317
"Mother, we would like to give you this", that "All right, give",

00:18:37.518 --> 00:18:38.951
but I am not attached.

00:18:39.152 --> 00:18:42.720
I cannot get attached. There's nothing that, that is within Me

00:18:42.921 --> 00:18:45.338
that can stick on to anything, nothing.

00:18:45.589 --> 00:18:48.812
I am just a moving force of Kundalini.

00:18:49.013 --> 00:18:52.190
How can I stick on anything? I am just moving all the time

00:18:52.391 --> 00:18:55.465
So it is not possible for Me to get attached to anything.

00:18:55.666 --> 00:19:00.874
In the same way, you just get inside this force and move with Me

00:19:01.075 --> 00:19:04.249
and just forget about all the rest of the things,

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.276
which stop your progress.

00:19:06.477 --> 00:19:10.232
You must progress with dignity,

00:19:10.701 --> 00:19:12.584
you must rise.

00:19:12.785 --> 00:19:14.392
I am sure it's going to happen.

00:19:14.593 --> 00:19:17.397
This time the people have been very sensible,

00:19:17.598 --> 00:19:19.694
they have been least critical,

00:19:19.895 --> 00:19:23.035
though some are still like that, does't matter

00:19:23.236 --> 00:19:28.536
but most of them have been very sweet and very dignified

00:19:28.737 --> 00:19:32.093
and collectivity is good and I am very happy

00:19:32.276 --> 00:19:35.973
that people are doing so well in this program.

00:19:36.174 --> 00:19:39.769
I am very happy. May God Bless you all!
