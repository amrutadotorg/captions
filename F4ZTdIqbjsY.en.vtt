00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:01.590
Adi Shakti Puja

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:02.930
2004, Cabella Ligure, İtalya

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.052
Today's meeting is very special.

00:00:10.052 --> 00:00:13.218
It's a very, very special day also,

00:00:13.385 --> 00:00:20.719
extremely special and very blissful.

00:00:22.552 --> 00:00:30.719
The reason is, it talks and sings and says

00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:43.719
about the born Order

00:00:43.927 --> 00:00:50.302
born Power,

00:00:52.343 --> 00:00:58.927
the Original, the Adi, the Primordial.

00:01:00.136 --> 00:01:04.218
And this one is responsible

00:01:04.427 --> 00:01:11.136
for creating this great universe.

00:01:13.011 --> 00:01:20.260
Why this has started and how it works out is...

00:01:20.468 --> 00:01:22.844
already you know;

00:01:23.052 --> 00:01:25.468
I need not talk about that.

00:01:26.635 --> 00:01:30.969
But today we have to talk about this Power,

00:01:32.844 --> 00:01:36.844
which is hidden in your hearts,

00:01:37.844 --> 00:01:42.844
by which you can do whatever you like to create

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:48.844
a new world, a new family,  a new standards,

00:01:49.136 --> 00:01:52.468
everything that is not known so far.

00:01:54.594 --> 00:01:59.552
That is quite possible;

00:02:01.844 --> 00:02:06.635
that is quite possible and is being done,

00:02:06.844 --> 00:02:10.719
but what is difficult is

00:02:10.886 --> 00:02:17.594
how to make people more adaptable, more

00:02:22.385 --> 00:02:27.427
in tune with each other, absolutely.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.427
It seems to be a difficult thing.

00:02:34.427 --> 00:02:37.136
They're all right among themselves,

00:02:37.385 --> 00:02:41.260
if they are own friends, their own styles and things.

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:48.343
But to make them absolutely one, one with each other

00:02:48.552 --> 00:02:54.886
in one tune, in one line is very, very difficult

00:02:55.094 --> 00:02:57.802
and it should not be done.

00:02:58.094 --> 00:03:00.552
That's not supposed to be;

00:03:00.844 --> 00:03:03.635
they're not supposed to be like that,

00:03:03.844 --> 00:03:08.635
but it has to work out.

00:03:09.218 --> 00:03:11.136
Now the problem is,

00:03:14.468 --> 00:03:19.468
we have beautiful people, beautiful souls,

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.136
but they do not become

00:03:22.468 --> 00:03:26.760
so one with each other as they should have.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.302
Now, how to solve this problem?

00:03:31.468 --> 00:03:33.260
Many people have asked Me,

00:03:33.552 --> 00:03:38.343
"Mother, how to make that problem";

00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:40.011
I just smiled.

00:03:41.011 --> 00:03:44.969
Because, if you see the original idea

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:54.552
why we started this x ray

00:03:54.844 --> 00:03:57.677
why we started this new kind of a

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:09.260
understanding, new kind of penetration -

00:04:09.552 --> 00:04:17.052
because we wanted to find out the oneness, the newness

00:04:17.343 --> 00:04:18.594
in every person.

00:04:19.218 --> 00:04:25.594
Now you should be very much thankful that

00:04:25.802 --> 00:04:30.385
you are all one, one inside,

00:04:30.594 --> 00:04:32.552
there's nothing second.

00:04:32.844 --> 00:04:38.510
There's only one and that one when it speaks

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:44.427
and when it wants to administer something,

00:04:44.927 --> 00:04:49.844
then you'll be amazed that it's all done the same way.

00:04:50.052 --> 00:04:54.969
It's the same thing and it works out the same way.

00:04:55.468 --> 00:05:00.927
There is no change, there's no difference between the two.

00:05:02.136 --> 00:05:09.677
Despite that, despite that, our minds are roving,

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:13.052
roving into some sort of a problem,

00:05:13.343 --> 00:05:17.552
which has no significance in Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:24.260
Now the main problem that we have is that

00:05:24.552 --> 00:05:27.052
we don't realize that we have no problem.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.802
We are without any problems.

00:05:32.302 --> 00:05:33.844
We think that there are problems and

00:05:34.136 --> 00:05:35.760
we should deal with problems,

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:39.136
but there are none; none of those problems are there.

00:05:39.427 --> 00:05:41.468
I don't see any problem anywhere.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.635
Those who think they have problems,

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:47.052
I've asked them to write it down,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.136
and I'll try to answer them

00:05:49.427 --> 00:05:52.552
and tell them what sort of a problem it is.

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:56.343
But before I could do anything, I would like to say

00:05:57.136 --> 00:06:02.635
that still our Sahaja Yogis are not come to that level

00:06:02.927 --> 00:06:06.969
to understand the oneness, the uniqueness

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:13.260
in their hearts of their oneness.

00:06:13.468 --> 00:06:20.552
All this comes from within, not from without,

00:06:21.427 --> 00:06:25.594
so all efforts made outside is of no use.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:31.594
We have to be effortless and become what we are.

00:06:32.094 --> 00:06:34.343
There you'll find  there is no... nothing.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:42.510
There is no need to have another... another meeting or

00:06:43.011 --> 00:06:46.136
any other coding something,

00:06:46.427 --> 00:06:49.343
no need; it's all there.

00:06:49.552 --> 00:06:52.802
Just you have to be that, to become that.

00:06:53.011 --> 00:06:55.969
This is rather difficult to understand for people

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:01.343
who have different noses, different faces, different everything,

00:07:01.635 --> 00:07:03.260
to become the same.

00:07:03.552 --> 00:07:05.886
But you are, you are; because

00:07:06.094 --> 00:07:10.218
you don't know that you are that's why you are looking different.

00:07:10.552 --> 00:07:15.136
So, I have to tell you one thing:  that you are all One.

00:07:15.343 --> 00:07:22.969
One in the sense that your everything,

00:07:23.177 --> 00:07:27.760
impulse, every feeling,

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:35.760
every understanding is the same.

00:07:37.552 --> 00:07:42.011
Only thing is that it arises at a wrong time,

00:07:42.218 --> 00:07:46.844
at different times and it gives you a wrong impression

00:07:47.136 --> 00:07:51.343
that it is different, but actually it is not.

00:07:51.635 --> 00:07:55.552
It is only one, one relationship,

00:07:55.719 --> 00:08:00.886
and the relationship is with the Adi Shakti

00:08:01.052 --> 00:08:06.136
- that you are a part and parcel of Adi Shakti;

00:08:06.343 --> 00:08:09.136
that whatever one may try,

00:08:10.468 --> 00:08:13.468
one cannot get separated from Adi Shakti.

00:08:13.677 --> 00:08:19.427
You are born out of Her and you are guided by Her,

00:08:20.427 --> 00:08:22.302
you are looked after (by) Her.

00:08:22.886 --> 00:08:26.260
Everything seems to be one to Me

00:08:26.468 --> 00:08:29.052
while you people think there is a different

00:08:29.343 --> 00:08:33.427
line of a course, line of action, which is wrong.

00:08:35.719 --> 00:08:38.177
Whatever I may say, it has to be proved,

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:45.677
otherwise why should you accept such a ghastly statement?

00:08:49.635 --> 00:08:53.677
Myself, I am one with you

00:08:53.886 --> 00:08:58.677
and I am always... will remain the same with all of you.

00:08:58.886 --> 00:09:04.343
For Me there is no difference. I don't see anything like that.

00:09:04.343 --> 00:09:09.094
It's outside; it's only your clothes and your style.

00:09:09.427 --> 00:09:15.719
Inside, maybe, what temperament you have,

00:09:15.927 --> 00:09:17.802
depends on your temperament.

00:09:18.927 --> 00:09:21.969
If that temperament changes a little bit,

00:09:22.136 --> 00:09:25.677
you will see the oneness among all of you

00:09:26.052 --> 00:09:30.011
and the differences will be lost in no time.

00:09:31.011 --> 00:09:33.677
Today I saw a very dangerous man.

00:09:33.677 --> 00:09:37.552
I thought he can kill Me if he wants.

00:09:37.844 --> 00:09:43.927
He can do whatever he likes. But no, it didn't happen.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.677
Why? Because I never understood him.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:53.802
He was not like that.  He just wanted to show his respect.

00:09:53.802 --> 00:09:57.677
He didn't want to kill Me or didn't want to do anything wrong.

00:09:57.969 --> 00:10:01.719
It's very surprising how you understand each other.

00:10:01.927 --> 00:10:05.802
Unless and until you have proper understanding of each other,

00:10:05.969 --> 00:10:10.677
you cannot achieve anything that is sober [Not clear],

00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:18.136
that is essential, that is right, that is the truth.

00:10:19.468 --> 00:10:21.886
So, the truth started long time back,

00:10:22.011 --> 00:10:29.844
much before anybody could think of having a truth here.

00:10:29.969 --> 00:10:37.927
It's all went off with so many things which were not truthful

00:10:38.136 --> 00:10:41.011
and then the truth went away.

00:10:41.218 --> 00:10:44.468
Like, I would say, that the snake...

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:50.677
snake was born out of ignorance

00:10:51.385 --> 00:10:54.218
that the other snakes started supporting.

00:10:54.844 --> 00:10:59.011
Snakes after snakes,  they started growing up

00:10:59.177 --> 00:11:06.011
and filling the whole universe with dishonesty and with wrong ideas

00:11:06.011 --> 00:11:10.343
and believing in it and started fighting,

00:11:10.552 --> 00:11:13.844
killing each other. But they were all snakes.

00:11:13.927 --> 00:11:20.218
So how much one should believe in their nonsense?

00:11:20.302 --> 00:11:23.677
How much one should follow their nonsense?

00:11:23.719 --> 00:11:29.177
How much anybody should accept their nonsense?

00:11:29.177 --> 00:11:31.011
It's very difficult.

00:11:31.343 --> 00:11:35.427
But it is acceptable much more than the truth.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:43.094
The truth is not so very easily accepted as the untruth is.

00:11:43.218 --> 00:11:44.760
Why?

00:11:44.886 --> 00:11:48.510
- Because we are standing in untruth.

00:11:48.719 --> 00:11:51.594
Our own understanding is untruth

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.468
and we'll have to change our understanding to truth,

00:11:55.844 --> 00:12:01.594
which is not difficult because we are truth. We are the truth.

00:12:01.677 --> 00:12:06.218
To become the truth, which we are, why should it be difficult?

00:12:06.218 --> 00:12:08.969
Should not, but it happens.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.468
So that means there is something wrong

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.969
somewhere within us, which we should find out.

00:12:15.136 --> 00:12:17.385
And the thing that isnwrong with us,

00:12:17.677 --> 00:12:21.886
within, is that we cannot face ourselves.

00:12:22.052 --> 00:12:25.052
We cannot face ourselves.

00:12:25.302 --> 00:12:28.260
We face others, not ourselves.

00:12:28.427 --> 00:12:31.343
We never see ourselves.

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:38.468
We have no idea as to what our own situation is.

00:12:38.552 --> 00:12:43.510
And for that is only you needed a Mother - to show you.

00:12:43.844 --> 00:12:46.886
And that's how the Mother came here

00:12:47.094 --> 00:12:53.385
on this earth to tell you what's the problem with you, within.

00:12:53.385 --> 00:12:59.343
This one is to be accepted. This principle has to be practised.

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:02.635
And you'll be amazed at yourself

00:13:02.927 --> 00:13:06.136
how much you have already a knowledge

00:13:06.427 --> 00:13:09.552
about yourself and about all the surroundings.

00:13:09.552 --> 00:13:14.302
There's nothing so special, nothing so extraordinary,

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:18.802
but only thing is you have to be acceptable to yourself.

00:13:18.802 --> 00:13:26.760
I think people are becoming Sahaja Yogis,

00:13:26.969 --> 00:13:28.844
but they are not.

00:13:28.969 --> 00:13:32.510
They are not Sahaja Yogis but they are trying to become.

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:36.594
On the contrary, they should know that they are Sahaja Yogis

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.677
and they don't have to become anything.

00:13:38.802 --> 00:13:40.927
Then there's no problem.

00:13:41.218 --> 00:13:44.302
But when you have accepted that there is

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:49.510
Sahaja Yoga different, and Sahaja Yogis are different

00:13:49.802 --> 00:13:51.094
and you are different,

00:13:51.302 --> 00:13:54.011
then how can you become Sahaja Yogis?

00:13:54.011 --> 00:14:01.260
The thing is the ignorance, is the ignorance that we have,

00:14:01.468 --> 00:14:05.886
that we are behaving like strangers towards each other.

00:14:05.927 --> 00:14:10.302
Complete ignorance. We have to know that we are all,

00:14:10.594 --> 00:14:12.594
all the same, very much.

00:14:12.677 --> 00:14:16.719
There's no need to have any ignorance of any kind.

00:14:17.136 --> 00:14:21.510
And when that happens, the problems of the whole world

00:14:21.802 --> 00:14:24.302
will be solved without any difficulty.

00:14:25.011 --> 00:14:27.677
Today's Puja is a special one

00:14:27.886 --> 00:14:31.302
because you are doing the Puja of something

00:14:31.594 --> 00:14:33.510
that never went into any transformation,

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:40.427
which was not changed at all; it was just the same,

00:14:40.719 --> 00:14:45.594
remained the same, born with the same and is still with the same.

00:14:45.886 --> 00:14:50.052
In such a Puja, what do I have to say?

00:14:50.218 --> 00:14:52.343
Why anyone has to say?

00:14:52.343 --> 00:14:56.094
Nothing. Just be one with yourself.

00:14:56.302 --> 00:14:58.510
That's the point we come to

00:14:58.552 --> 00:15:01.510
- that we have to be one with ourselves,

00:15:01.802 --> 00:15:05.218
and not to get it lost in the words

00:15:05.427 --> 00:15:12.094
or in the atmosphere or in the other... our movements of brain.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.635
Because, this is the time when the brain starts moving;

00:15:15.635 --> 00:15:20.177
and when it starts moving, it loses its control over himself.

00:15:20.177 --> 00:15:26.218
Like a snake - unless and until it is in its own place,

00:15:26.552 --> 00:15:28.136
there's no danger;

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:32.594
but as he starts moving, there's a danger to him.

00:15:32.719 --> 00:15:36.468
In the same way, we have to know that our mind is

00:15:36.677 --> 00:15:42.136
very very difficult and should not go into wrong direction.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:47.218
For that, we have to do the Primordial Mother's Puja

00:15:47.427 --> 00:15:51.802
because we should try to be on the line of Primordial Mother.

00:15:51.969 --> 00:15:55.343
We have to keep ourselves Primordial.

00:15:55.844 --> 00:15:58.886
We have to work out our Primordial Self,

00:15:59.094 --> 00:16:03.677
and not to change ourselves for any rhyme or reason.

00:16:04.094 --> 00:16:07.343
This will be the best thing, if we can achieve it.

00:16:07.468 --> 00:16:10.719
I'm sure we can, not such a problem.

00:16:11.011 --> 00:16:17.886
Only thing is that we are so conscious of being Indians,

00:16:18.052 --> 00:16:23.052
being English,  being English, European and all that.

00:16:23.385 --> 00:16:25.260
But we are not.

00:16:25.468 --> 00:16:29.844
We are just ourselves and that's what we have to achieve

00:16:30.011 --> 00:16:35.635
- that Oneness with ourselves.
May God bless you all!
