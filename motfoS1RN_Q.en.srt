1
03:25:44,970 --> 03:25:51,090
This was a song composed by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore

2
03:25:52,350 --> 03:25:56,050
so many years back, when he had a vision

3
03:25:56,630 --> 03:25:59,410
of our Ganapatipule seminars.

4
03:25:59,910 --> 03:26:04,250
where he describes that people from all the world will come,

5
03:26:04,790 --> 03:26:06,730
from different countries will come.

6
03:26:08,530 --> 03:26:15,270
Also, the Hindus, the Muslims, Christians, Sikhs and all kinds of communities

7
03:26:16,270 --> 03:26:22,610
will get their awakening on the bank of the sea.

8
03:26:23,070 --> 03:26:25,530
‘Sagar’, sagar is the sea.

9
03:26:27,410 --> 03:26:31,410
So beautifully every detail he has described.

10
03:26:32,010 --> 03:26:34,930
He was a seer and he could see the future

11
03:26:35,490 --> 03:26:40,590
where many people, who are seekers, to become ‘mahamanav’ they come.

12
03:26:41,450 --> 03:26:45,550
And it’s very surprising how these seers

13
03:26:45,570 --> 03:26:47,490
have seen the future.

14
03:26:47,650 --> 03:26:50,310
Like, as you know, C. S. Lewis is there

15
03:26:50,410 --> 03:26:53,630
and also, we have got William Blake, so many others.

16
03:26:55,190 --> 03:26:59,050
And I feel today, in Bengal, when I have come here in Calcutta,

17
03:26:59,650 --> 03:27:01,950
that his dreams are fulfilled.

18
03:27:02,450 --> 03:27:05,690
His Spirit would be so happy to know-

19
03:27:12,630 --> 03:27:17,490
So, as you know that we get all kinds of people, all races,

20
03:27:17,950 --> 03:27:20,950
all religions together in Ganapatipule

21
03:27:20,965 --> 03:27:24,065
and where you all enjoy the bliss of

22
03:27:25,550 --> 03:27:30,230
God, where you feel that there’s an awakening.

23
03:27:30,230 --> 03:27:32,065
Also, He says that

24
03:27:32,070 --> 03:27:35,850
the great Mother has now risen, and She is awakened

25
03:27:35,850 --> 03:27:38,025
and She is going to awaken you.

26
03:27:38,030 --> 03:27:41,170
So, clearly, he has seen the whole thing.

27
03:27:41,170 --> 03:27:45,530
It’s remarkable how these seers can see things and reveal,

28
03:27:46,090 --> 03:27:47,710
to our amazement.

29
03:27:49,290 --> 03:27:54,110
I am very happy that we have such nice company

30
03:27:54,110 --> 03:27:58,870
of Baba Zaheer and his other brothers,

31
03:27:59,110 --> 03:28:03,310
who are qawwals and his sons also, who are qawwals.

32
03:28:04,250 --> 03:28:07,590
So, this is such a great thing to understand

33
03:28:07,590 --> 03:28:13,390
that these people have felt the same awakening within them as you have,

34
03:28:14,990 --> 03:28:16,290
and that

35
03:28:16,885 --> 03:28:19,795
they have really become Sahaja Yogis now

36
03:28:19,795 --> 03:28:21,590
and they sing from their heart.

37
03:28:21,670 --> 03:28:26,045
Some of these poems, I think, they made later on, after going from Bombay.

38
03:28:26,045 --> 03:28:29,085
Because I see that they are all new songs.

39
03:28:29,550 --> 03:28:33,190
And, they are singing what you would like to say.

40
03:28:33,790 --> 03:28:37,330
they are singing what you would like to express.

41
03:28:37,835 --> 03:28:41,025
And that’s why you feel so joyous and happy

42
03:28:41,025 --> 03:28:44,375
that, "you are saying what we wanted to say all these days".

43
03:28:45,750 --> 03:28:49,750
It’s remarkable how in the collectivity the thought

44
03:28:51,330 --> 03:28:52,330


45
03:28:52,790 --> 03:28:56,790
Tongue works in a very different manner

46
03:28:57,310 --> 03:29:01,045
that we all want to say the same thing.

47
03:29:01,050 --> 03:29:03,150
For everyone, that is the truth.

48
03:29:03,270 --> 03:29:05,630
And you all feel so joyous about it

49
03:29:05,630 --> 03:29:07,630
and so happy about it.

50
03:29:07,970 --> 03:29:14,090
It is something, a kind of a rapport between one Realized soul and another Realized soul.

51
03:29:14,610 --> 03:29:18,950
Only a Realized soul can understand the bliss

52
03:29:19,470 --> 03:29:22,010
and the joy of this expression.

53
03:29:22,630 --> 03:29:25,990
Of course, so many things have been said about Me,

54
03:29:26,450 --> 03:29:30,110
that’s quite embarrassing. I don’t know what I do.

55
03:29:30,850 --> 03:29:34,130
I, really, I don’t think I do anything. It's all working out.

56
03:29:34,230 --> 03:29:38,310
It's all grace of the, this All-pervading Power

57
03:29:38,310 --> 03:29:41,130
which is working out everything so well.

58
03:29:41,430 --> 03:29:43,690
Today is the concluding day for us

59
03:29:45,490 --> 03:29:51,070
and to have such a nice program of qawwali here was really remarkable.

60
03:29:51,590 --> 03:29:54,630
I am sorry that half of the people have left

61
03:29:54,630 --> 03:29:57,030
because they didn’t know there was a program.

62
03:29:57,550 --> 03:30:01,610
Today we had to make some arrangements, in that it was lost.

63
03:30:02,190 --> 03:30:03,350
Doesn't matter.

64
03:30:03,350 --> 03:30:07,190
Those who are lucky have listened to them and have enjoyed them thoroughly.

65
03:30:15,190 --> 03:30:18,230
I bless those qawwals from my heart,

66
03:30:18,810 --> 03:30:23,010
and I always think there will be more people

67
03:30:23,390 --> 03:30:26,470
who will appreciate their music and understand

68
03:30:26,790 --> 03:30:30,030
and so many Muslims-

69
03:30:30,030 --> 03:30:32,550
as yesterday, Ilal said, "Mother, when will the Muslims know about You?"

70
03:30:32,850 --> 03:30:36,550
So, these are the people who can spread the news all over

71
03:30:36,550 --> 03:30:40,030
and can tell that now the time has come of ‘Qiyama’

72
03:30:40,390 --> 03:30:43,430
where you will have to get your Self-realization.

73
03:30:43,430 --> 03:30:46,710
They're very important, I'm so concerned about the Muslims now

74
03:30:47,130 --> 03:30:51,590
Because they are in quite darkness, and the way they are killing people

75
03:30:52,470 --> 03:30:55,915
because they are Muslims and they are killed in so many places

76
03:30:55,915 --> 03:30:57,770
while they also kill.

77
03:30:57,770 --> 03:31:00,810
It's a very violent, nonsensical thing,

78
03:31:00,810 --> 03:31:03,110
which was never preached by Mohammed Sahib.

79
03:31:03,710 --> 03:31:07,050
He was the one who was for love and love and love.

80
03:31:07,730 --> 03:31:12,410
He is the one who had to fight because they were so aggressive on Him.

81
03:31:12,410 --> 03:31:13,910
But otherwise,

82
03:31:13,950 --> 03:31:16,490
if you read Koran, you'll be surprised

83
03:31:16,490 --> 03:31:19,290
how much He has praised the love of God.

84
03:31:19,930 --> 03:31:23,030
And that’s what is so misleading these days

85
03:31:23,210 --> 03:31:24,750
that we don’t understand.

86
03:31:25,030 --> 03:31:29,670
I am happy at least the Sahaja Yogis understand Koran and understand Mohammed Sahib

87
03:31:30,050 --> 03:31:35,510
and are in devotion to Mohammed Sahib as they are to any other Guru.

88
03:31:35,990 --> 03:31:39,110
It’s very creditable for you people to accept.

89
03:31:40,030 --> 03:31:45,490
Because you have seen on your vibrations that Mohammed Sahib was an Incarnation

90
03:31:45,890 --> 03:31:47,510
of a Master

91
03:31:47,730 --> 03:31:49,590
so you cannot deny it.

92
03:31:49,730 --> 03:31:54,725
And these conditionings have gone into complete negligence now,

93
03:31:54,725 --> 03:31:57,565
and most of the Sahaja Yogis have such a respect

94
03:31:57,570 --> 03:32:00,090
for Mohammed Sahib and for Koran.

95
03:32:01,670 --> 03:32:04,410
I wish all the luck to these people

96
03:32:04,510 --> 03:32:06,905
that they propagate this idea

97
03:32:06,910 --> 03:32:11,210
and try to bring peace on this earth

98
03:32:11,790 --> 03:32:16,290
by telling people that what Mohammed Sahib has said and what are we doing.

99
03:32:16,830 --> 03:32:18,630
In the same way, for all of us,

100
03:32:18,630 --> 03:32:21,070
to whatever religion we may belong,

101
03:32:21,075 --> 03:32:23,475
we have so many conditionings and wrong ideas.

102
03:32:23,475 --> 03:32:25,535
So, we should try to correct them

103
03:32:26,130 --> 03:32:28,490
and see for ourselves that

104
03:32:28,670 --> 03:32:32,090
all of them came to spread spirituality.

105
03:32:32,290 --> 03:32:35,890
As I always said, they were like flowers on a tree

106
03:32:35,890 --> 03:32:38,650
same tree of spirituality they came.

107
03:32:39,190 --> 03:32:42,610
And whatever they had to do at that time, ‘samayachar’, they did it.

108
03:32:43,130 --> 03:32:45,585
But we have plucked the flowers

109
03:32:45,585 --> 03:32:47,935
and now fighting with the dead flowers.

110
03:32:49,275 --> 03:32:52,405
So, as Sahaja Yogis, when you are awakened in knowledge,

111
03:32:52,410 --> 03:32:54,770
and you know what knowledge is,

112
03:32:54,910 --> 03:33:01,870
then you have to really understand that we are all on the same path of spirituality.

113
03:33:03,250 --> 03:33:05,190
There’s no difference at all.

114
03:33:05,510 --> 03:33:09,370
May God bless you all for enjoying this qawwali

115
03:33:09,750 --> 03:33:12,650
and for coming all the way to Calcutta.

116
03:33:15,670 --> 03:33:19,890
It has been really a tremendous task, I must say.

117
03:33:20,230 --> 03:33:28,490
All my thanks are to these great organizers

118
03:33:28,490 --> 03:33:32,850
who have organized such a big thing in this place.

119
03:33:32,990 --> 03:33:36,870
And we had, yesterday, the whole thing filled up, you see.

120
03:33:37,290 --> 03:33:41,910
And the way it was conducted and worked out was so remarkable.

121
03:33:42,570 --> 03:33:45,210
All the leaders who came here

122
03:33:45,210 --> 03:33:48,470
were amazed at their organizing capacity.

123
03:33:48,775 --> 03:33:51,925
And they told Me, “Mother, we have to learn a lot from them.

124
03:33:52,050 --> 03:33:54,530
We can, of course, not surpass them.

125
03:33:54,850 --> 03:33:58,990
But whatever they have done is such an eye-opener

126
03:33:58,990 --> 03:34:02,070
that we have to now dedicate ourselves fully

127
03:34:02,910 --> 03:34:06,670
to proper understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

128
03:34:07,010 --> 03:34:11,810
its spreading and all the organizing should be our first priority.

129
03:34:12,330 --> 03:34:15,585
Unless and until people take interest in that,

130
03:34:15,585 --> 03:34:18,815
we cannot achieve what these people have achieved.”

131
03:34:19,115 --> 03:34:21,705
The collectivity of the

132
03:34:22,830 --> 03:34:27,810
Bengali people and Marwaris and all types of people

133
03:34:28,270 --> 03:34:29,750
who are here,

134
03:34:30,810 --> 03:34:35,610
from every part of our country, is so remarkable.

135
03:34:36,310 --> 03:34:40,430
There’s no quarrelling, no discussion, no argument,

136
03:34:40,430 --> 03:34:42,650
it's done so beautifully.

137
03:34:42,650 --> 03:34:45,850
Unbelievable how they have worked it out!

138
03:34:46,590 --> 03:34:49,625
So, we have to remember that we are one

139
03:34:49,625 --> 03:34:52,285
part and parcel of one being.

140
03:34:52,290 --> 03:34:55,630
And once we really realize that,

141
03:34:55,630 --> 03:34:58,730
we’ll enjoy each other’s company very much.

142
03:34:59,370 --> 03:35:02,830
All Sahaja Yogis enjoy each other's company.

143
03:35:03,150 --> 03:35:07,510
And also, all of you from the whole world, who have come here

144
03:35:08,030 --> 03:35:11,610
have seen how marvelously they have organized everything.

145
03:35:12,650 --> 03:35:16,730
I am thankful to you for coming here to celebrate My birthday

146
03:35:17,770 --> 03:35:18,790
And

147
03:35:19,130 --> 03:35:22,170
I don't know what to say now,

148
03:35:22,550 --> 03:35:29,270
because every birthday you discover such nice things and such nice people.

149
03:35:30,510 --> 03:35:35,610
This birthday was really remarkable for its all organization

150
03:35:36,270 --> 03:35:39,630
and the way it was worked out so smoothly.

151
03:35:39,630 --> 03:35:42,370
I wish we all learn from this.

152
03:35:43,170 --> 03:35:49,250
We are all thankful to the organization of Calcutta,

153
03:35:49,610 --> 03:35:52,950
for organizing this so well. Give them a hand.

154
03:36:14,185 --> 03:36:18,565
I know it's so overwhelming that we cannot even stop clapping.

155
03:36:19,855 --> 03:36:26,495
Also, we have to again and again thank these qawwals,

156
03:36:27,932 --> 03:36:30,882
who have come here all the way from
Hydrawad

157
03:36:31,322 --> 03:36:34,502
and have giving expressions to your feelings, 

158
03:36:35,082 --> 03:36:37,582
also give them a hand.

159
03:36:48,018 --> 03:36:50,738
They are really religious people

160
03:36:50,878 --> 03:36:53,948
and that's how they got to Sahaja Yoga so easily

161
03:36:53,977 --> 03:36:57,097
And now the way they feel confident about life,

162
03:36:57,702 --> 03:37:00,362
as you people all feel confident.

163
03:37:00,527 --> 03:37:03,787
In the kingdom of God, there's nothing to worry 

164
03:37:03,927 --> 03:37:09,147
nothing to bother about future or past, but to enjoy the present.

165
03:37:09,257 --> 03:37:12,237
And that's what they are doing and you were doing too.

166
03:37:12,237 --> 03:37:16,717
I enjoyed, I enjoyed the rapport that existed between you.

167
03:37:17,137 --> 03:37:20,072
Thank you very much. May God bless you.

168
06:51:57,137 --> 06:51:59,137
