00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:21.780
You see, it shows how William Blake thought
of you people; and he represents that hope

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:33.159
for England in this poem that I had about
you people.

00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:47.090
As I had told you that: England is the heart;
and the heart has to be first of all established,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.500
otherwise Sahaja Yoga is not going to be established.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:03.889
Now the people who live in this country are
least believing, I think, in William Blake

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:08.640
as you all do.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:21.859
(Inaudible) [This poem shows] Very clearly
what hopes William Blake had.

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:32.130
He could see the vision very clearly and he
said that England has to become the Jerusalem.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:40.990
In Sanskrit language it’s called as teevtha.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:54.130
Teevtha means a pilgrimage place, a place
where pilgrims come in.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:02.409
And this indication here, of this poem, which
is so beautifully written by William Blake,

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:13.550
shows that he saw the vision of Sahaja Yoga
prospering in England in this beautiful manner.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:29.340
But, as it is, this heart is so materially
bound.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.300
There’s so much of materialism that has
come into our veins even.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:44.140
And we have to realize that we have to get
it out of our mind, out of our body.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:52.090
It has gone into us so much, the materialistic
approach towards life, that we have to really

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.260
take a strong action against it.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:04.300
It’s so much that anybody who comes to this
country also becomes materialistic.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.590
Imagine [the] heart becoming a matter.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.990
Think of [the] heart becoming a stone.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:25.190
And today on a day when you are here to worship
Me as a Guru.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.870
My desire is only one and that is that you
all should become gurus yourself.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:37.790
Now I have struggled for seven years here
to build you up and all the struggle that

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:47.460
is described has been done single-handed to
begin with and then so many of you joined.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:53.620
But when you join Me you have to realize that
you have to really transform yourself.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.590
You have to know that you are, first of all,
realized souls.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.740
Which, also, very few people really realize
and are aware, I think, that they are realized

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.740
souls.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:11.260
They are not the other, mundane, type of people,
ordinary people.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.070
They are realized souls.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:27.680
So as it is they have to get out off this
shell in which they have been living.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:35.170
The ideas of securities, that you have had
so far, come to you all from materialism if

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.120
you study yourself correctly.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.590
Everything is trickling down to you that is
materialism.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.030
How many people read William Blake?

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.160
How many understand him and how many believe
in him?

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.120
And then how many follow him?

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:04.310
He is a lost poet of this country.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:11.220
After getting realization, unless and until
the people of England understand that they

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:20.290
have to completely transform themselves into
a new awareness of understanding that: you

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:29.510
are now realized souls, you are part and parcel
of the whole and you are aware of it.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:35.170
Firstly, materialism crawls into you in so
many ways.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.190
Because there has been industrial revolution.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.639
People have created many things.

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:50.030
Matter has been comforting you
and you got used to matter.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.060
You just can’t do without it.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:06:04.010
A small thing say for example – you must
have a paper napkin, or you must have a glove.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:09.210
This is the minimum of minimum.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:22.900
But see, how many countries use these things?

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.380
How many people in the world use these things?

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.420
It is not needed for the body.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:39.550
By this over preservation of yourself and
by this domination of matter upon yourself,

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:48.680
you have really become delicate darlings,
absolutely delicate darlings.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.480
Like if you go to Himalayas take it.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:58.120
I went to Bhowali and other places like Nainita.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:11.510
They are, all the time, colder than London,
and there are peaks which are, all the time,

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:22.180
covered with snow and the people there never
use shoes or socks, never.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:29.080
They take their baths everyday with cold water,
every day!

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:39.190
You’ll be amazed every one of them, they
have rosy cheeks, they are not pale, they

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.870
are healthy people.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:46.930
Their women folk carry all the wood, all the
way up the hill.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:54.440
God has made your body in such a way that
it can bear up lots of things.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:08:03.610
Of course now, suddenly, an Englishman cannot
become a Pahadi, means a man living on the

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:05.310
hills, that I understand.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:06.860
You cannot suddenly become that.

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:13.389
But gradually try to give up certain things
that you think so important in life.

00:08:13.389 --> 00:08:15.570
Try!

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:18.699
One day it may pain, second day it may pain.

00:08:18.699 --> 00:08:26.020
Because unless and until you make really great
effort to get rid of materialistic body and

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:30.520
mind, you cannot be alright.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:42.800
And this is the biggest stumbling block for
the western seekers.

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.319
You have to get out of that cocoon, as I said.

00:08:45.319 --> 00:08:51.240
The whole transmutation has to take place.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:58.279
Every time you ask anyone, he’s catching
still.

00:08:58.279 --> 00:09:08.529
How can you become Gurus?

00:09:08.529 --> 00:09:14.240
I mean your Guru can live in whatever conditions,
as I told you the other day.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:19.230
Now there are some Indians here, ask them
if they can wash their hands in washbasins

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.689
with the water in it.

00:09:22.689 --> 00:09:26.060
Ask any Indian.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.450
They just can’t do it.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:32.770
They can’t use paper only, they just can’t
live with the paper only.

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:35.170
They just can’t live like that.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:36.170
Impossible.

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:40.959
I can’t think of one Indian who can do that.

00:09:40.959 --> 00:09:44.700
Even in the poorest conditions in England
they cannot do it.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:51.199
They might have lived here for twenty-five
years I can assure you, they just can’t

00:09:51.199 --> 00:09:52.199
do it.

00:09:52.199 --> 00:09:54.499
They can’t live without baths.

00:09:54.499 --> 00:10:00.550
You may tell them a hundred times that “you
take your bath once a week,” it’s impossible.

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:06.029
Two weeks is out of question, they will die.

00:10:06.029 --> 00:10:11.790
Even if they have got lung cancer they will
take.

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:16.730
But you have seen Me, how much I can adjust.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:21.190
Though all my life I’ve lived in India.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:26.459
I can live under any circumstances, I can
live in Indian villages.

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:30.699
In any circumstances I can live.

00:10:30.699 --> 00:10:36.970
So the other day also I told you, and again
I tell you, first of all get out you this

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:43.029
mala, this filth of materialism.

00:10:43.029 --> 00:10:46.790
Indians also become materialistic when they
come to England.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:49.019
For them money is important, nothing else.

00:10:49.019 --> 00:10:56.410
They have no time for anything else but for
money.

00:10:56.410 --> 00:11:00.209
It’s a fact.

00:11:00.209 --> 00:11:05.410
Anybody who touches this land becomes money
possessed.

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:12.910
If you tell them that money’s not everything
they can’t understand, they go mad.

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:17.089
Morning till evening they are also running
in the rat race.

00:11:17.089 --> 00:11:19.170
Now you have to change, you have to come out
of it.

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:26.010
You have to stand out and see for yourself
that you are no more one of these mad people

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:27.860
who run after matter.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:33.660
And you leave each and every thing, every
particle of it here and die; again you are

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.809
born, again you are doing the same thing.

00:11:36.809 --> 00:11:44.350
You have to run away from comfort.

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:47.559
You must learn how to overcome your comforts.

00:11:47.559 --> 00:11:50.910
You must train your body.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:55.990
Little noise here and there.

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:59.889
Englishman, I am saying Englishman because
we are in England.

00:11:59.889 --> 00:12:01.980
Americans are much worse.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:07.680
Any noise fifty percent would die with any
blasting they hear.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.779
Just by hearing.

00:12:08.779 --> 00:12:11.230
They are so sensitive.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:16.939
I mean they have made their bodies, their
everything, so sensitive that they are really

00:12:16.939 --> 00:12:17.939
dainty darlings.

00:12:17.939 --> 00:12:20.639
And can you imagine, read the second part
of it loudly.

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:22.519
Second part of it you just read it.

00:12:22.519 --> 00:12:24.920
Where is the second part now?

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.519
Gavin – just read it.

00:12:26.519 --> 00:12:32.360
Read it out loudly and see for yourself with
these dainty darlings how am I going to do

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.360
this.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.640
Gavin: “Bring me my Bow of burning gold.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.300
Bring me my arrows of desire."

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.050
Shri Mataji: What is going to happen?

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:43.040
You have no answer.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.369
Gavin: “Bring me my spear Oh, clouds unfold.

00:12:47.369 --> 00:12:49.470
Bring me my chariot of fire."

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:51.910
Shri Mataji: Of fire?

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.540
You can’t sit even on a chariot.

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:54.540
(Laughter) Really!

00:12:54.540 --> 00:13:02.110
Because it shakes and you have to hold it
tight and you have to stand erect with it.

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:09.420
Gavin: “I will not cease from mental fight
nor shall my sword sleep in my hand.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:14.670
Till we have built Jerusalem in England’s
green and pleasant land."

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:17.959
Shri Mataji: I think better give swords into
everybody’s hand.

00:13:17.959 --> 00:13:24.249
Let’s see how many can hold it straight.

00:13:24.249 --> 00:13:34.379
You see Sahaja Yoga is not a simple thing
like dish washing.

00:13:34.379 --> 00:13:42.879
It’s a very serious thing and on certain
things you are very well equipped, but on

00:13:42.879 --> 00:13:46.920
certain things where you are not equipped,
that must be sustained.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:52.529
Your strong points are your strong points
so forget about them.

00:13:52.529 --> 00:13:57.670
Whatever are your weak points, hit them there.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:01.180
I mean mentally you are very well equipped.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.970
If I have to argue with you I will give up.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:10.589
I really can’t because you are very knowledgeable
people.

00:14:10.589 --> 00:14:15.560
You have read all the books of the world,
you are over read.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.839
You are too great.

00:14:17.839 --> 00:14:24.619
But, as far as your body is concerned, your
body is a slave of matter.

00:14:24.619 --> 00:14:30.629
In a way your mind is also a slave of matter.

00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:36.959
So to understand that we have to be great
gurus, first of all a guru has to go through

00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:46.660
a great discipline of self-emancipation, self-emancipation.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:54.369
Great discipline is needed.

00:14:54.369 --> 00:15:01.369
And the great discipline of self-emancipation
is, first of all, we must get rid of the idea

00:15:01.369 --> 00:15:02.679
of comfort.

00:15:02.679 --> 00:15:05.670
You can’t sit on the chair?

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:06.670
Alright.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:08.769
You can’t sit on a particular chair?

00:15:08.769 --> 00:15:13.360
Sit on that chair everyday till that chair
breaks completely.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.079
You cannot sit on the ground?

00:15:15.079 --> 00:15:19.029
Sit on the ground, everyday.

00:15:19.029 --> 00:15:20.680
You can’t live without one thing?

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.740
Try to do that.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:25.299
That’s how you make your body alright.

00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:30.540
Make your body your slave and not you the
slave of the body.

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:36.059
Because if you have to become the guru your
body should be such that it should just adjust

00:15:36.059 --> 00:15:38.549
to everything that you want to do, otherwise
what’s the use?

00:15:38.549 --> 00:15:43.019
Imagine you have a car which you cannot handle,
will you sit in such a car?

00:15:43.019 --> 00:15:53.859
You will bash yourself and bash others also
and that’s what you are doing.

00:15:53.859 --> 00:16:06.859
One has to realize that: to overcome this
material drag upon yourself, you have to work

00:16:06.859 --> 00:16:13.709
it out on yourself.

00:16:13.709 --> 00:16:22.449
Then, once you have controlled this, minimum
of minimum, that you can sleep anywhere you

00:16:22.449 --> 00:16:23.449
feel like.

00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:28.609
Try to sleep on the ground for a while.

00:16:28.609 --> 00:16:35.989
That you may do for sun tanning, and people
cannot resist all this nonsense because these

00:16:35.989 --> 00:16:38.709
are ideas put into you.

00:16:38.709 --> 00:16:40.749
They have exploited you.

00:16:40.749 --> 00:16:44.670
They have told you that: this should be done,
that should be done, this is necessary, that

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.110
is necessary.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:53.019
They have to sell their goods.

00:16:53.019 --> 00:16:55.069
Try to sometimes fast.

00:16:55.069 --> 00:16:59.709
I have prohibited Indians from fasting, because
what they do is to fast.

00:16:59.709 --> 00:17:02.790
At the slightest pretext they fast.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:05.500
I mean, as it is, there is a dearth of food
in India – so they fast.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:09.100
What is the need for them to fast?

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:16.649
But here it is necessary that people should
learn to fast and should not get attracted

00:17:16.649 --> 00:17:17.649
towards food so much.

00:17:17.649 --> 00:17:23.839
I mean the attraction towards food, also,
is a sign that your senses are just driving

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:25.910
you mad, isn’t it?

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:26.910
Think of it.

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:32.940
Now separate yourself from your senses and
see how it drives you mad.

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:38.670
First of all the body, then the senses we
should attack.

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:44.679
The biggest enemy we have is our own tongue.

00:17:44.679 --> 00:17:48.899
It acts in two ways.

00:17:48.899 --> 00:17:51.820
One is the taste.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.690
The food – taste.

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:58.250
And the second way it attacks is the way we
talk.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:03.269
Either we don’t talk or when we talk we
just hit.

00:18:03.269 --> 00:18:04.510
We cannot be kind.

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:05.510
We cannot be compassionate.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:09.210
We cannot communicate our heart to anyone.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:14.050
Control your tongue.

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:19.320
First of all try to control your tongue on
those two things.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:23.049
You want to eat a cake then don’t eat cake
for a year.

00:18:23.049 --> 00:18:27.540
This is the only way you can train your tongue,
I really tell you.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:34.039
Now if you say something harsh all the time,
say you have a way of speaking some sort of

00:18:34.039 --> 00:18:36.410
an abuse,[then] try to change it.

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:42.860
Try to change.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:50.920
Try to make your speech a sweet one.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:54.200
Make it a beautiful one, attractive.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.350
You cannot be a guru in Sahaja Yoga, I can
tell you, with a sharp tongue.

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:00.429
Those gurus are finished.

00:19:00.429 --> 00:19:07.169
We had gurus before, they used to just sit
with a big stick in the hand.

00:19:07.169 --> 00:19:10.809
To anybody coming, first they would give twenty-five
nice ones.

00:19:10.809 --> 00:19:17.370
Still if the fellow would stick on, then they
would say, “Alright now come closer to me."

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:21.990
Then they may slap him twice.

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:26.950
If he could bear that, I mean they could go
to any limit of torturing their disciples,

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:38.139
they would put the disciple upside down, in
a well and pull him up and again dip him down,

00:19:38.139 --> 00:19:40.419
pull him and dip him down – eleven times.

00:19:40.419 --> 00:19:47.130
And still if he survived then he would help.

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:49.390
They used to take physical test.

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:59.409
I mean their disciples had to be really wrestlers,
very healthy people, having a lot of resistance

00:19:59.409 --> 00:20:01.809
and stamina, otherwise they would not take.

00:20:01.809 --> 00:20:07.809
And they said “Erya gabaliyatze karma no
ahe” – “it’s not the job for any Dick,

00:20:07.809 --> 00:20:09.010
Tom and Harry."

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:11.830
Thus they would only select one person.

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:21.330
They would make him sit on the thorns or on
the nails.

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:25.610
Actually there were seats of nails.

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:28.720
These people were made to sit on the seats
like that.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.380
I mean I’m not telling you lies, you can
find out.

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:46.940
And they used to treat them as if they are
on a suicide squad, absolutely like that.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:51.620
The determination had to be like that.

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:58.659
Then they would accept them as a disciple,
not as a guru still.

00:20:58.659 --> 00:21:04.380
Then beating them nicely morning till evening.

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:05.380
You have heard of Mr.

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:08.440
Ravi Shankar, a great sitarist.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:19.539
I remember My father was a political adviser
to the king where his guru, Allaudin Khan

00:21:19.539 --> 00:21:22.019
Sahib, used to live.

00:21:22.019 --> 00:21:30.260
And I remember that day when I was in college
and he was also young, might be slightly younger

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:36.630
to Me in age, or maybe, I don’t know what
was his age that time.

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:44.330
But he was studying with this fellow, this
guru of his and we went there.

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:51.130
So My father was a great connoisseur of music
and his guru used to respect My father.

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:53.490
So he asked, that, “Why don’t you play?”

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:56.010
My father asked, to Ravi Shankar.

00:21:56.010 --> 00:22:01.490
He said, “Sir please,” his eyes came out,
He pleaded.

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:03.680
He was so frightened!

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.870
Then his guru played.

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:11.230
You see, he used to play on Mridangam(actually
Pakhawaj) that’s a kind of double tabla,

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:12.929
a double percussion.

00:22:12.929 --> 00:22:19.159
He was a great genius, then he went away for
something.

00:22:19.159 --> 00:22:21.760
So Ravi Shankar crawled up to My father.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:26.669
He said, “Sir never ask me, before my guru,
to play.

00:22:26.669 --> 00:22:27.669
You see?”

00:22:27.669 --> 00:22:32.260
Then he lifted his hair and showed a big bulge
was there.

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.740
“You see, this I got yesterday for playing
one note [wrong].

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:39.710
My sitar was broken and this (bump) I’ve
got instead of the sitar!

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:42.889
This is my guru’s Prasad.

00:22:42.889 --> 00:22:45.490
So please for heaven’s sake”.

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:49.480
Still he stuck on to him.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:57.759
And you can see the results today he’s Ravi
Shankar.

00:22:57.759 --> 00:23:01.100
But you have a Guru who is a mother.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:10.679
I never hit you, I don’t think I have hit
anyone of you.

00:23:10.679 --> 00:23:11.679
You got your realization.

00:23:11.679 --> 00:23:12.679
In all my compassion I looked after you.

00:23:12.679 --> 00:23:15.610
I have given you compassion.

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:22.990
I’ve never asked for anything nor have I
complained for anything or grudged for anything.

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:28.380
I have been extremely, extremely, extremely
patient with you.

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:36.150
So you have to be My prototype.

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:43.460
You are a guru in Sahaja Yoga in this Maha
Yoga, you are not a guru of this type who

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:54.559
can only create one disciple in twenty one
thousand years, sort of a thing.

00:23:54.559 --> 00:24:00.260
You have got the knowledge of Kundalini much
more than any one of these gurus have got.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:07.289
You have the powers much more than any one
of these gurus have.

00:24:07.289 --> 00:24:16.210
Indiscriminately this power has been given
to you.

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:29.669
Now only those who will come up and grow as
proper trees will be called as gurus.

00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:36.460
And that is why one has to know how to grow
properly as a guru.

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:42.020
First of all you must give up all materialistic
attitude towards Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:47.850
Many Sahaja Yogis even have an idea that it
should be used for certain purposes.

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:59.470
You see, that it should house us, it should
give us some place to live in.

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:07.840
Some people have an absurd idea that it should
also provide us food, free.

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.429
That it should not touch, at all, our married
life.

00:25:10.429 --> 00:25:14.130
We can have our plans with our married life
the way we like.

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:22.240
You can lead absolutely, a very selfish, self-centered
married life.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:28.720
Also some people have an idea that we are
not to spend a single pie for Sahaja Yoga

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:34.590
but take all the advantages out of it.

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:38.409
Such people should never hope to become gurus.

00:25:38.409 --> 00:25:45.440
They may try to show off but they’ll go
down.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.320
You have to learn humility.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:55.179
First of all you have to be humble people.

00:25:55.179 --> 00:26:02.240
Unless and until you have a large heart you
can never humble down.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:06.210
You have to be an extremely humble person.

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:20.330
Humility doesn’t mean that you bow to a
person who is dominating, it never means that.

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:23.710
But it means a strength within you.

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:27.840
The person who is weak can never be humble.

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:36.379
He can never bear the load like this Mother
Earth bears our load so well, because she’s

00:26:36.379 --> 00:26:42.269
so great.

00:26:42.269 --> 00:26:55.380
You have to be strong enough within yourself
to bear the load of your disciples, of people

00:26:55.380 --> 00:27:00.919
who try to follow you.

00:27:00.919 --> 00:27:06.120
Humility should be that: “I was like them,
absolutely like them.

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.279
I was nothing.

00:27:07.279 --> 00:27:09.090
Without Sahaja Yoga what was I?”

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:13.160
I mean you may be the governor of some place;
alright, so what?

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.549
Before God’s eyes what are you?

00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:19.490
Nothing, nobody knows who you are.

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:21.749
You may be having cars and anything.

00:27:21.749 --> 00:27:24.200
You might be a very educated anything.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:29.350
What does it matter in the name (does Mother
mean “realm”?) of God?

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:33.909
You have known that saints have not been so
educated.

00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:40.389
Christ never went to any university, did he?

00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:46.789
All these ideas that we have got of our greatness
must be absolutely made zero.

00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:57.970
The greatness is in humility and sweetness.

00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:06.690
Speak something that will be dear to others,
that would be appealing to them in a proper

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:14.470
discriminating diplomatic manner.

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:26.090
Some people in the name of honesty just are
sadistic, or useless.

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:33.519
You can talk to people nicely, say something,
in such a way that they feel attracted towards

00:28:33.519 --> 00:28:35.559
you.

00:28:35.559 --> 00:28:51.179
That they feel that there is complete humility,
that you accept them as they are because you

00:28:51.179 --> 00:28:56.450
want to give them.

00:28:56.450 --> 00:29:03.789
All kinds of subtler arrogance also develops
in people, I have seen.

00:29:03.789 --> 00:29:12.129
I can’t understand how people develop this
kind of arrogance.

00:29:12.129 --> 00:29:19.080
Like, supposing somebody knows how to do the
puja, take an XYZ.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:22.140
He becomes so arrogant.

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:25.840
If somebody knows some Sanskrit he becomes
arrogant.

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:36.039
If, say, somebody comes to see Me more often
than others, she becomes arrogant.

00:29:36.039 --> 00:29:38.950
Somebody manages a hall, he becomes arrogant.

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:44.490
Or somebody programs something, he becomes
arrogant.

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:48.490
Anything you do, first thing that happens
is, in your tongue, you develop a big ego

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:49.700
like that.

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:52.340
You become a sharp tongued person.

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.712
Cut your tongue many a times.

00:29:54.712 --> 00:29:55.712
Punish it.

00:29:55.712 --> 00:30:02.779
It has no business to be like that because
it is not going to serve the purpose for which

00:30:02.779 --> 00:30:04.019
it is there.

00:30:04.019 --> 00:30:12.380
A guru’s vani is so great that every word
he speaks is a mantra.

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:19.889
Every sentence he says opens a complete universe.

00:30:19.889 --> 00:30:24.649
It should be that powerful and that beautiful
not to close down anybody’s heart.

00:30:24.649 --> 00:30:29.960
You speak to someone, the other person says,
“Oh God never see his face."

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:39.200
Sahaja Yoga depends on you more than it depends
on Me.

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.019
You have to change.

00:30:41.019 --> 00:30:44.120
You have to change yourself very much more.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:52.490
Just by taking up some sort of a role or assuming
something great you are not going to progress

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:53.490
at all.

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:57.649
Supposing a little bush says, “I am a tree."

00:30:57.649 --> 00:30:59.230
Will it become a tree?

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:03.960
Supposing it behaves like a tree will it become
a tree?

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:09.789
It has to become the tree then there is no
need to behave, you are a tree.

00:31:09.789 --> 00:31:14.710
A woman walks like a woman and a man walks
like a man.

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:18.649
If you behave like a woman will you become
a woman?

00:31:18.649 --> 00:31:22.749
It has to be innate.

00:31:22.749 --> 00:31:23.910
It has to be within us.

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:33.559
If you are a guru you are a guru anybody can
see and say, “Ah that’s a guru."

00:31:33.559 --> 00:31:42.210
Then you can do lots of things.

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:47.929
We are not willing to give up these things,
that’s why we go on catching on the same

00:31:47.929 --> 00:31:50.360
point, catching on the same point.

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:58.700
At least those who are here should decide
today that we are going to change ourselves

00:31:58.700 --> 00:31:59.700
completely.

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:05.350
Let us start on the changing.

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:12.760
We meet others, we greet others, talk to them.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:14.450
We should be able to talk.

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:17.190
There are some people who just don’t know
how to talk.

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:20.250
They just don’t talk, they are all the time
– never heard their voice.

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:24.429
If they telephone I can’t even recognize
because I’ve never heard their voices before.

00:32:24.429 --> 00:32:26.850
You must talk.

00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:29.279
Open out.

00:32:29.279 --> 00:32:34.100
What is there to have fear?

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:40.139
Humility doesn’t mean fear, it means complete
love.

00:32:40.139 --> 00:32:46.100
You must talk, open out, be interesting.

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:47.419
Try to do something for others.

00:32:47.419 --> 00:32:50.380
I have been saying this again and again.

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:52.539
You have to all become gurus.

00:32:52.539 --> 00:32:55.499
I am just a Mother.

00:32:55.499 --> 00:33:00.190
And Mother is the first and the last guru
for everyone.

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:07.120
That’s how I’m your Guru and I’m the
Guru of all the Gurus.

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:13.860
But you have to become your own guru.

00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:22.850
And for that you have to think that you have
to hold swords in your hand.

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:28.869
Not only to hold swords in your hand, you
have teach others to hold the swords.

00:33:28.869 --> 00:33:32.450
What should be the character of that man who
has to guide others?

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:35.070
He himself cannot hold the sword in his hand.

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:37.799
What is he going to teach to others?

00:33:37.799 --> 00:33:44.200
You just tell Me that – a simple question.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:52.220
At least you should have that personality
that can hold the sword in the hand.

00:33:52.220 --> 00:34:06.399
So the first thing one has to know is to absolutely
enslave your body and enslave your senses.

00:34:06.399 --> 00:34:07.710
You can give justification.

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:09.750
I know people know how to give justification.

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:12.820
“I said this because he said that."

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:15.880
It’s not that.

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:29.160
It is you who do not know that you are harming
yourself.

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:31.130
Try to get out of it.

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:37.200
You are asking but now you have to face, you
have to give.

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:42.560
This asking is over now, finished.

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.420
You’ve got everything.

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:49.360
You are not aware you have got everything
now within yourself.

00:34:49.360 --> 00:35:02.240
Just reverse the position and you can give
to others.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:14.820
But if you’re hankering still, worried about
these nonsensical things then nobody is going

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:18.350
to respect you.

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:23.210
I would suggest one thing, that: take to detachment.

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:26.760
In a way a sanyasa absolutely a sanyasa.

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:27.760
You know I am a sanyasi.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.360
Though I live in a household and all that,
I am not bothered about things.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:39.460
I am a sanyasi, but the day I will announce
that I have taken a sanyasa people will be

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:47.300
much more impressed by Me than they are today.

00:35:47.300 --> 00:36:00.330
If a person is over attached to things, attached
to money, attached to this, that, and all

00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:04.510
those things, such a person is not going to
impress others in spiritual matters.

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:13.190
You can be a nice prime minister of England,
but you have no place in Sahaja Yoga if you

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:16.870
do not have a way of detachment.

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:24.920
That doesn’t mean that you become hippies
by any chance- not at all.

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:32.850
But it means that you become detached.

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:42.690
Specially it is very important for you to
develop that – a detachment.

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:46.980
Detach yourself from things that you are supposed
to be possessing.

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:52.730
I can tell you, you cannot take anything with
you.

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:55.680
Can you?

00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:02.700
We know that we are not going to take.

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.180
Now you are aware of it, that you’re not
going to take, also.

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:11.500
It’s not that you are not aware.

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:18.600
Then why are you attached?

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:23.430
All kinds of disgraceful behavior ensues when
you are attached.

00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:25.220
Become a sanyasi.

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:35.900
It doesn’t mean you wear that yellow or
red and all kinds of horrible dresses.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:39.870
But from inside you become a sanyasi.

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:49.010
That’s the best way you conquer your void.

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:52.850
The void question first comes because of wrong
guru.

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:54.880
Of course, no doubt about it.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:38:02.480
If you have been to a wrong guru then the
void will be very, very bad no doubt.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:09.590
Because you have followed a wrong guru you
will always have to remember that you have

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:14.340
to follow the right Guru, out and out.

00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:17.520
Absolute full surrendering otherwise it will
never go down.

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:22.520
And if you start sort of “Yes I know, Mother
is alright,” this kind of thing will not

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:23.520
work out.

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:31.350
You have to go all out to accept the right
Guru if you have a void problem.

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:48.330
And this void problem is so deep, is so deep
that, first of all, it indicates Ekadesha

00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:49.330
Rudra.

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:57.640
Ekadesha Rudra is a very dangerous thing because
it can give you from left to right all kinds

00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:06.950
of funny things, even cancer, epilepsy, all
kinds of diseases.

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:14.350
So those who have been to other gurus have
to go all out to neutralize it on the void

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:15.350
part.

00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:22.500
And for them it is necessary to really decide
to become a sanyasi.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:28.510
In the sense that – don’t get attached
to material things too much.

00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:31.310
Because from these gurus all kinds of things
have come to you.

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:36.700
Some people might have picked up bad things
like telling lies.

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:44.410
You see, even I’ve seen people who go to
these gurus can pick up some sort of a horrible

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:49.000
intrigue; intriguing nature.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.280
Anything they can pick up.

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.820
I have seen people who have been to gurus.

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:59.580
They have such horrible spirits in them that,
when they come to Sahaja Yoga also, they intrigue

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:00.580
with Sahaja Yogis.

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:01.580
They intrigue!

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:05.890
You see [whether] their bhoots intrigue or
they intrigue – God alone knows, but go

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:08.400
on intriguing against Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:15.430
They talk to people against Sahaja Yoga they
do this, they are not aware.

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:19.140
And their void goes out again and again.

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:25.580
So for anyone who has followed any such things,
any practices of this kind or even self-meditation

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:34.340
or anything like, must get to it and see to
it that you really surrender fully to the

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.820
right Guru.

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:41.670
Fully, hundred percent.

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:45.900
Complete obedience.

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:54.010
Not to judge or not to even ask questions.

00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:58.070
That would help very much in the void.

00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:04.910
But I can tell you spirituality is such great
thing that, if you accept that kind of obedience,

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:09.700
it fills you up with such powers, tremendous
powers.

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:13.530
Obedience is the key of becoming the best
guru.

00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:18.490
If you do not know how to respect, nobody
is going to respect you.

00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:21.470
If you have not been under any command you
cannot command anyone.

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:33.570
Surrendering is the best way for void people
especially.

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:40.370
First of all you must surrender completely,
blindly you can say.

00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:42.860
Just jump into it.

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:46.790
Do not reason it out.

00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:49.040
Complete surrendering.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:55.530
Once you have done that you will be surprised
how you’ll be so blessed with the powers

00:41:55.530 --> 00:42:06.300
of a guru that you’ll rise to heights and
you will do all that William Blake has said.

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:14.750
Because it is like a drop submerging into
the ocean and becoming the ocean.

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:19.770
And you know the ocean is the Guru, not a
drop.

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:28.850
It’s the ocean and the ocean has everything
in it.

00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:33.790
So we have to learn from the ocean to be the
ocean by becoming the ocean yourself.

00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:49.000
I have told you in many ways how it is important
that we have to have many gurus of Sahaja

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.140
Yoga.

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:57.140
But if Sahaja fails it fails because of Sahaja
Yogis not because of Me, always.

00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:03.770
What I hear, “Mother we went there, there
were two Sahaja Yogis they were very rude

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:07.910
to us so we would like to talk to you and
not to them."

00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:10.490
It’s very common.

00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:17.340
Or a fight between the two Sahaja Yogis or
a misunderstanding or all sorts of things

00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:19.470
between sahaja yogis.

00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:21.220
You are the reflection of Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:28.670
You are the mirrors, not Me.

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:32.880
You have to reflect Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:37.820
So first of all you have to become good reflectors
– the good gurus.

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:42.840
Now look at these gurus who move about.

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:48.330
They have millions and millions of disciples
except that they are crooks of the first order.

00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:54.100
They have no other qualifications to be gurus.

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:56.720
They have no idea of Kundalini they cannot
raise Kundalini.

00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:00.000
They are not even holy people leave alone
anything else.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:08.090
They don’t deserve to enter into any temple
of God leave alone His Kingdom.

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:15.710
They are from hell and they have mesmerized
people and they have got their disciples.

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:24.560
You can also [raise the Kundalini], just through
your character and through your abilities

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:31.240
as Sahaja Yogis, which are tremendous.

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:37.320
Even those who are great gurus in India cannot
raise the Kundalini the way you can raise.

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:38.590
Under their finger?

00:44:38.590 --> 00:44:40.640
They can’t believe it.

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:44.100
It’s Shri Ganesha’s powers you have got.

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:48.860
Look at the surrendering of Shri Ganesha.

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:52.920
Look at His surrendering.

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:57.990
Completely surrendered to his Mother.

00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:02.990
Who is wiser than Him?

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:07.840
And in His wisdom He has chosen complete surrender
to His Mother.

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:15.440
To Him His Mother is Guru, She is Brahma,
Vishnu, Mahesha everything, even SadaShiva

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:20.260
is Her, – His Mother; nothing else.

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:23.710
And his power of Kundalini raising is within
you.

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:25.530
You’ve got it.

00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:29.190
You are made after his power.

00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:43.720
He is holiness, he’s auspicious, he’s
innocence.

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:50.700
A guru has to be innocent, has to be an innocent
person.

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:55.730
His innocence can be crafty.

00:45:55.730 --> 00:46:00.520
But innocence should be crafty, he should
not be crafty.

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:03.450
Innocence is the power which works the craftiness.

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:05.560
It’s the Krishna shakti.

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:06.760
It does.

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:07.760
It works out.

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.070
Suddenly you face it.

00:46:09.070 --> 00:46:12.840
You try anything it will be there.

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:25.210
And he depends on his powers and not on his
own methods of maneuvering things.

00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:36.260
But how many of you are religiously working
it out morning, evening, every moment of life?

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:43.610
How many of you are thinking that we are on
the path of becoming full fledged gurus of

00:46:43.610 --> 00:46:48.910
Sahaja Yoga and nothing else.

00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:50.980
You are nothing else but that.

00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:52.520
How many of you decide like that?

00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:53.520
Every moment.

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:57.970
It’s very easy just to say, “Oh it’s
alright I don’t believe in it."

00:46:57.970 --> 00:47:05.550
Then what are you going to do?

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:09.950
What are you without Sahaja Yoga?

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:12.360
Think of it.

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:14.260
You can say, “I don’t want to do it."

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:17.010
You’ll have to do it.

00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:18.210
You are in it now.

00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:25.160
You better do it.

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:28.820
You have to do it fast.

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:36.520
For heavens sake better do it fast.

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.730
Achieve it!

00:47:38.730 --> 00:47:42.390
You have all the powers believe Me, you have
all the powers.

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:48.840
Believe Me, you are better than all these
gurus put together.

00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:58.070
But be humble, do not talk big.

00:47:58.070 --> 00:48:00.000
And do not become silent bores also.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.540
I mean some of them are real silent bores.

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:06.630
They cannot be gurus I can tell you this much.

00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:09.060
That’s another quality.

00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:12.300
They’re absolutely boring people.

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:14.060
Nobody wants to stay with them.

00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:21.140
I mean, you have to have people around to
be a guru, you can’t be a guru of yourself!

00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:22.140
(laughter).

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:26.750
If everybody says, “Oh, he’s such a boring
person,” nobody will be there.

00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:30.110
You have to be interesting.

00:48:30.110 --> 00:48:31.990
You have to be interesting.

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.990
You have to be dynamic.

00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:37.980
You should know some stories here and there.

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:41.100
You have to make them laugh.

00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:42.140
They should enjoy you.

00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:45.490
This is Sahaja Yoga guruship.

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:57.620
You see for such boring gurus one or two would
stick on if they are equally boring or more

00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:58.690
boring.

00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:05.310
But such gurus are not going to help us in
Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:07.010
They are not.

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:15.930
You have to be joyous, cheerful, helpful,
understanding, concerned.

00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:24.280
You have to be concerned about others.

00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:31.540
You have to behave in a way that they feel
that you are the security for them.

00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:36.230
But that doesn’t mean that you get after
one person.

00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:42.230
You see, everything you tell them goes into
some sort of a mad mould, I don’t know how

00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:43.230
it happens – whatever I say.

00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:46.650
For example, I say you should be concerned.

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:52.310
Here I find that people start then, “Alright
I am concerned."

00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:57.670
So they start working on a person.

00:49:57.670 --> 00:50:02.360
And then they’ll come, “Mother my left
hand is finished.

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.570
Why?

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:05.890
I was working on such a person."

00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:06.890
Why?

00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:08.160
What was the need?

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:09.510
You need not.

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:11.320
That’s not your job.

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:13.140
Let them also work.

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:17.150
You must know how to make them work also.

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:23.050
Otherwise, you see these lazy lumps will use
you all the time.

00:50:23.050 --> 00:50:29.560
Let them also, tell them to get up and work,
arise.

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:36.910
Why can’t they work it out?

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:37.910
They can work it out themselves.

00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:39.080
But then don’t tell them, “Now you work
it out."

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:42.060
Not like that.

00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:43.420
Then another extreme can start.

00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:50.700
You should say, “Now see, you have a left
side problem and I don’t think that you

00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:52.101
should make me work it out.

00:50:52.101 --> 00:50:54.610
I think you can work it out, lets see.

00:50:54.610 --> 00:50:57.920
I too had the same time type, let’s work
it out.

00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:01.450
You better put your left hand towards the
photograph, put right hand outside.

00:51:01.450 --> 00:51:03.400
Do this way that way.

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:04.780
Beat yourself.

00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:07.750
Left side is Adi Shakti’s this thing.

00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:12.440
You can ask for Mahakali’s powers it can
be worked out."

00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:17.500
Give him all the knowledge say, “Now try,
try yourself."

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:22.790
Because if you’re obliging too much also,
then you make them dwarfs, you see.

00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:28.690
You have to be a tree which makes others grow
into trees and not to make them dwarfs under

00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:29.690
it.

00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:33.290
You see, no grass can even grow under such
trees, leave alone trees.

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:38.890
Even the grass can’t grow if the trees are
of this type.

00:51:38.890 --> 00:51:46.350
So you should be actually the tree of brilliance,
of sun, sun’s rays.

00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:52.190
From you the sun’s rays should flow and
they should grow.

00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:56.520
Not to obstruct every growth of your disciples.

00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:11.960
What sort of a guru could he be, whose disciples
are all toddlers or still sucking their thumbs?

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:18.530
So you should be a guru of a caliber that
makes others grow too.

00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:24.240
I have hopes that my disciples will grow more
than I am.

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:32.830
I have hopes we’ll see that.

00:52:32.830 --> 00:52:38.080
That’s my desire, that’s what I want,
that my disciples should grow.

00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:39.603
I mean, that will be my pride.

00:52:39.603 --> 00:52:50.060
Like Ganesha grew more than His own Mother,
who created Him.

00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:52.620
That’s what is My desire.

00:52:52.620 --> 00:53:01.290
And that’s what I want you to realize that
you are the hope of the world.

00:53:01.290 --> 00:53:06.650
Either you should not have taken birth in
England.

00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:15.910
If you have taken, you have more responsibility
not to be English and to be universal, because

00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:24.250
you have taken birth in the heart of the universe.

00:53:24.250 --> 00:53:28.270
You cannot be small-minded.

00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:32.380
You cannot be chicken hearted.

00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:42.080
Either you are frightened or you are aggressive
– this is an impossible situation.

00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:53.350
You have to be so strong that nothing should
make you frightened, and such a person is

00:53:53.350 --> 00:53:54.640
the most benevolent personality.

00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:59.910
He’s not frightened of anyone, why should
he harm anyone?

00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:18.400
Today I hope you people really don’t listen
to my lecture but put it in your heart, and

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:26.700
understand that you have to become very dignified
majestic gurus of this universe.

00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:36.750
I would like to ask William Blake what is
he doing.

00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:44.720
When is he going to take his birth on this
earth?

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:49.290
When people of his caliber are going to be
born in this country, or they are all running

00:54:49.290 --> 00:54:53.570
away again to some other place to be born?

00:54:53.570 --> 00:55:01.940
Marriage system of England is wretched.

00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:04.890
You cannot adopt those methods that these
people are having.

00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:09.730
You want to have the great people to be born
to you and every time you are running towards

00:55:09.730 --> 00:55:10.820
the divorce cases.

00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:14.520
How can they be born in this country?

00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:17.950
You have to give up all these wretched systems
of this country.

00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:26.310
The good of this country should be taken,
whatever is good in it, and transform this

00:55:26.310 --> 00:55:29.210
country into a beautiful thing.

00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:36.120
I mean if you really love this country then
create it into a lovable place, isn’t it?

00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:42.960
You must try to destroy all that is retarding
the progress, the spiritual progress of this

00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:49.980
country if you are a real Englishman.

00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:53.569
Real is the word.

00:55:53.569 --> 00:56:07.150
You should not be proud of all the weaknesses
that have crawled up in all these hills and

00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:08.510
dales.

00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:14.660
All unholy thoughts, all inauspicious behaviors,
all must be discarded.

00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:15.050
We are not that.
