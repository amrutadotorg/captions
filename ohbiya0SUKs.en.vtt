Importance of Meditation in Sahaja Yoga

00:22.460 --> 00:28.837
Question: In meditation, where should
we put our consciousness in the body?

00:29.038 --> 00:31.970
Shri Mataji: You don’t have to do anything,
you just get into it.

00:32.171 --> 00:34.970
When the Kundalini crosses over
this center,

00:35.171 --> 00:37.476
immediately you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:37.677 --> 00:42.586
That’s a state when you are in the present
– neither in the future, not in the past –

00:42.787 --> 00:46.781
and then the growth, spiritual growth
starts working it out.

00:46.982 --> 00:55.179
And suddenly you will find one day that you
have touched that depth of your divinity.

00:57.813 --> 01:02.680
You don’t have to direct yourself at all,
the Kundalini itself directs.

01:09.145 --> 01:12.273
Question: There are so many different forms
of meditation.

01:12.474 --> 01:16.211
Does any sort of meditation work?
Shri Mataji: No, no, it does not.

01:16.412 --> 01:20.523
We do not meditate, we have to be
in meditation.

01:20.738 --> 01:25.928
There’s difference between the two. You do
not meditate before realization;

01:26.129 --> 01:31.961
after realization you are in meditation.
So you become thoughtlessly aware.

01:32.162 --> 01:37.016
So when you meditate in Sahaja Yoga you
become thoughtlessly aware,

01:37.216 --> 01:41.678
and then you start growing into a new
awareness

01:41.880 --> 01:46.101
or a higher awareness which you call
as doubtless awareness,

01:46.302 --> 01:50.343
and that is how you start growing.
So the meditation is

01:50.544 --> 01:55.286
that you get into meditation, you don’t
do meditation.

01:56.502 --> 01:59.061
And it’s such a spontaneous happening.

01:59.262 --> 02:02.154
Only thing, you have to learn to be
spontaneous.

02:02.331 --> 02:07.970
And that’s what I find that in Sahaj people
still,

02:08.171 --> 02:13.756
though they are out of this illusion,
this ocean of illusion,

02:13.957 --> 02:19.193
still sometimes their one leg is still
there in the ocean,

02:19.394 --> 02:23.264
and still they’re pulling it out and
pushing it back.

02:23.465 --> 02:29.709
That should not be. That is only because
people don’t meditate.

02:29.910 --> 02:33.990
Now to say you must meditate, people think
it’s a kind of a ritual

02:34.191 --> 02:39.826
or maybe a kind of a style of Sahaja Yoga –
no.

02:40.027 --> 02:46.625
Meditation is for you to go deep down
into yourself,

02:46.826 --> 02:50.701
to achieve all that your Sahastrara wants
to give you.

02:50.902 --> 02:59.081
To achieve that height of detachment,
of understanding,

02:59.282 --> 03:05.401
is only through meditation. So what happens
in meditation is

03:05.602 --> 03:11.651
that your awareness crosses over Agnya,
goes above

03:11.852 --> 03:18.293
and is now stationed in the Sahastrara,
in thoughtless awareness.

03:18.494 --> 03:23.733
Then the reality of Sahastrara, the beauty
of Sahastrara

03:23.934 --> 03:28.832
starts pouring in your own character,
in your own temperament.

03:29.033 --> 03:33.278
Unless and until you meditate –
not meditate just to get well

03:33.479 --> 03:38.885
or just to feel that “I must meditate” –
but meditation is very important

03:39.086 --> 03:42.464
for all of you, that you develop
your Sahastrara

03:42.665 --> 03:48.839
in such a manner that you imbibe
the beauty of your Sahastrara.

03:49.040 --> 03:53.399
If you don’t use your Sahastrara
in this way,

03:53.600 --> 03:57.175
after some time you’ll find Sahastrara
will close down,

03:57.376 --> 04:02.659
you’ll have no vibrations and you’ll have
no understanding of yourself.

04:02.860 --> 04:07.757
So very, very important thing is
to meditate. I can immediately make out

04:07.958 --> 04:14.510
a person who has been meditating and
the one who has not been meditating.

04:14.726 --> 04:18.429
Because a person who does not meditate
he still, thinks that

04:18.630 --> 04:21.907
“Oh, it’s all right, I’m doing this,
I’m doing that.”

04:22.108 --> 04:31.709
Meditation is the only way you can enrich
yourself with the beauty of reality.

04:31.910 --> 04:37.259
There’s no other way. I cannot find
any other way but meditation

04:37.460 --> 04:44.491
by which you rise into the realm
of divinity.

04:44.692 --> 04:49.069
For example I would say that Myself,
whatever I have done is this,

04:49.270 --> 04:55.608
that I have been able to find out a method
how to give Self Realization to masses.

04:55.809 --> 05:01.608
But that doesn’t mean that if I give
to masses they are all Sahaja yogis – no.

05:01.809 --> 05:04.475
You must have seen whenever you have
your programs

05:04.676 --> 05:07.170
people get Realization when I’m there,

05:07.371 --> 05:15.892
and they come to programs for a while
and then they drop out.

05:16.093 --> 05:19.358
The reason is, they have not meditated.

05:19.559 --> 05:28.987
They, if they had meditated they would have
known what is their quality, what are they.

05:29.188 --> 05:37.250
Without meditation you don’t understand
what is best for you.

05:37.451 --> 05:41.859
So today is a day when you have to promise
Me that you’ll meditate

05:42.060 --> 05:46.743
every night, every evening, maybe
in the morning also.

05:46.944 --> 05:50.993
Whenever it is possible if you can go
into meditative mood,

05:51.194 --> 05:56.787
you are in contact with this divine Power.

05:56.988 --> 06:02.616
Then whatever is good for you, whatever
good for your society,

06:02.817 --> 06:08.558
for your country, all is done by this
divine Power.

06:08.769 --> 06:11.933
You don’t have to overpower the divine
Power,

06:12.134 --> 06:15.604
you don’t have to order, you don’t have
to ask.

06:15.805 --> 06:22.308
Just if you meditate you are one with
this all-pervading Power,

06:22.509 --> 06:28.027
which is another great blessings to us.

06:28.447 --> 06:33.693
But I’m not saying that you go on meditating
for hours together, not necessary.

06:33.878 --> 06:39.388
But with full faith in yourself and
in the divine Power,

06:39.589 --> 06:41.675
if you work it out, I’m sure

06:41.876 --> 06:47.021
it’s not difficult to rise to that state
of consciousness.

06:47.222 --> 06:53.341
That is what we have to achieve.
It’s possible for men as well as for women.

06:54.589 --> 06:58.294
(To get to) the inner side of yourself,
to the subtler side of your being,

06:58.495 --> 07:02.475
you must allow the Kundalini to go
through the Agnya.

07:02.676 --> 07:06.426
And to cross the Agnya is a very important
thing in modern times,

07:06.627 --> 07:09.288
and for that you have to meditate.

07:09.489 --> 07:13.827
If you can meditate with complete faith
in yourself

07:14.028 --> 07:19.140
this Agnya can be opened out, with
surrendering to the Divine;

07:19.341 --> 07:24.671
you have to surrender yourself
to the Divine. And when this Agnya opens

07:24.872 --> 07:30.492
you’ll be amazed, your Sahastrara is just
waiting to transfer,

07:30.693 --> 07:37.601
to give you all the help that you need
through the all-pervading Power.

07:37.802 --> 07:44.211
Your connection of Sahastrara with
the all-pervading Power is established.

07:44.412 --> 07:51.062
And by that you’ll be amazed how all these
seven chakras work for you,

07:51.263 --> 07:55.639
how they help you, how they try
to give you

07:55.840 --> 07:59.642
whatever is the real knowledge
about everything.

07:59.912 --> 08:03.689
But first and foremost is your Sahastrara.

08:03.890 --> 08:07.606
Only your Sahastrara can reflect the light
of the Divine.

08:07.807 --> 08:10.958
So your Sahastrara is extremely important.

08:11.159 --> 08:16.136
You must meditate to enrich your
Sahastrara, to cure it,

08:16.337 --> 08:19.962
to make it completely nourished
by the Kundalini.

08:20.163 --> 08:25.047
There`s no need to do many rituals,
but meditation, and also

08:25.248 --> 08:33.474
little bit of taking bandhan even now today
is necessary I think, when you go out;

08:33.675 --> 08:39.225
because still Kali Yuga is working
its own pangs,

08:39.426 --> 08:43.343
and the Satya Yuga is trying to come out.

08:43.544 --> 08:48.839
We are the ones who are going to support,
look after the Satya Yuga.

08:49.054 --> 08:56.010
And that’s why the Sahastrara opening is
very, very important, it’s very important.

08:56.211 --> 09:02.601
And those who want to grow should
meditate

09:02.802 --> 09:06.392
every day, whatever time you may come home;

09:06.593 --> 09:09.760
maybe in the morning, maybe in the evening,
anytime.

09:09.961 --> 09:13.457
But you will know that you are meditating
when you can get

09:13.658 --> 09:17.034
into thoughtless awareness, then you
will know.

09:17.235 --> 09:21.221
Your reaction will be zero. Look at
something – you will just look at it.

09:21.398 --> 09:26.416
You won`t react, because you are
thoughtless. You won`t react.

09:26.617 --> 09:34.016
When that reaction is not there then
everything, you’ll be surprised, is Divine,

09:34.185 --> 09:38.446
because reaction is your Agnya’s problem.

09:38.647 --> 09:41.929
Once you are absolutely thoughtlessly
aware,

09:42.130 --> 09:47.117
you are one with the Divine. So much so
that Divine takes over

09:47.302 --> 09:54.071
every activity, every moment of your life,
and looks after you.

09:54.272 --> 09:58.235
And you feel completely secured, one
with the Divine,

09:58.436 --> 10:01.633
and enjoy the blessings of the Divine.

10:01.834 --> 10:04.297
May God bless you.
