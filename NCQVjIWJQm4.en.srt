1
00:00:02,111 --> 00:00:11,833
I’m just trying to remember if I had a more
fantastic birthday than this!

2
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:26,793
Where words do not come, there the joy
cannot be expressed.

3
00:00:27,734 --> 00:00:34,905
When it becomes so deep, that there is no movement.

4
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:41,628
This is a great country.

4.1
00:00:41,705 --> 00:00:46,528
Australia has been created

5
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:54,973
for a special purpose in Sahaja Yoga.

6
00:00:58,481 --> 00:01:10,900
This is the Mooladhara chakra, where resides Shri Ganesha, of this world.

7
00:01:12,404 --> 00:01:24,596
How important it is to keep this centre awakened within us.

8
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:30,410
The information about my coming

9
00:01:33,117 --> 00:01:39,199
can only be broadcasted from this centre.

10
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,918
Then the world Kundalini is going to rise.

11
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:47,400
When you are putting your hands towards me,

12
00:01:47,655 --> 00:01:55,706
then the divine love passes through
your fingers,

13
00:01:55,943 --> 00:02:03,057
goes down through your Ida and Pingala

14
00:02:03,258 --> 00:02:10,970
and informs Shri Ganesha about my presence

15
00:02:11,184 --> 00:02:15,392
and then the Kundalini rises.

16
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:35,210
So today, we should say, is a great day 
in the history of divine work,

17
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:41,465
where I came to Australia.

18
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:49,431
They asked me, “Was there any incarnation
in Australia?"

19
00:02:49,632 --> 00:02:55,738
"Did God visit Australia in human form?"

20
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:03,388
I said, “It’s not easy to reach Shri Ganesh!”

21
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:09,084
Even Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh could not reach Shri Ganesh.

22
00:03:09,285 --> 00:03:15,866
And you know that he is placed like a lotus

23
00:03:16,075 --> 00:03:39,004
where all kinds of people who are insulted,
tortured, ignored, are saved.

24
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:49,877
Here he really decides whom to save
from hell, and whom not to save.

25
00:03:50,078 --> 00:03:54,101
God’s decisions are very different,
they are absolute.

26
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:59,267
Human decisions are extremely cruel
and blind.

27
00:03:59,468 --> 00:04:07,184
And today you find so many saints in this
Mooladhara.

28
00:04:07,385 --> 00:04:13,181
This is the work of Shri Ganesh.

29
00:04:13,382 --> 00:04:18,128
He has called you on this great chakra

30
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:24,991
where Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha 
also cannot enter in it

31
00:04:25,207 --> 00:04:31,418
that you should stay here and grow
into beautiful saints

32
00:04:31,619 --> 00:04:36,093
of very great magnitude in spirituality.

33
00:04:36,294 --> 00:04:41,979
Such glory is to him, is such a fortunate thing,

34
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,343
and such a blessing,

35
00:04:45,544 --> 00:04:51,232
that even Indians could be jealous of you.

36
00:04:58,993 --> 00:05:09,421
One has to see how Shri Ganesha acts within us.

37
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:14,544
It’s very important to recognise him,

37.1
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,944
to understand him and to imbibe,

38
00:05:19,145 --> 00:05:25,633
otherwise, you will be wasting all His
energies staying in this place,

39
00:05:25,834 --> 00:05:31,894
living in this place, so close to him.

40
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:39,356
And though he is the giver of wisdom,

41
00:05:39,565 --> 00:05:46,211
I wonder how many people understand
the word ‘wisdom’.

42
00:05:46,757 --> 00:05:52,130
Wisdom is the centre of gravity within us

43
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:58,469
which gives us the fulcrum on which
we rotate,

44
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:01,878
by which we realise that we are inclined

45
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,985
to the left or to the right.

46
00:06:08,593 --> 00:06:17,737
This fulcrum we have to be aware of,

47
00:06:17,938 --> 00:06:22,569
because otherwise we will not know
how far we have gone.

48
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:29,648
Not only [that], but we should know that it is so much 

49
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:37,776
the centre of gravity and our fulcrum - so close.

50
00:06:37,977 --> 00:06:44,453
Because if your centre of gravity and
fulcrum are separated

50.1
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,291
there’s no integration. 

51
00:06:47,354 --> 00:06:51,291
You can be ruined completely.

52
00:06:52,228 --> 00:07:01,341
So wisdom means this integration between
your understanding

53
00:07:01,852 --> 00:07:12,433
and the understanding of Shri Ganesha, <i>within you.</i>

54
00:07:13,445 --> 00:07:22,00
For example, we go to extremes, extremes of behaviour.

55
00:07:22,162 --> 00:07:25,549
I would give you a very simple example:

55.1
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:28,549
I was going to Hong Kong

56
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:34,884
and the lady who organised it, 
she telephoned to me again and again

57
00:07:35,085 --> 00:07:41,158
and she told me that, “A big batch of people are coming to receive you

58
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:49,214
and you are going to be on the television
from the moment you land..

59
00:07:49,415 --> 00:07:51,705
and this is going to happen and that is going to happen”.

60
00:07:51,906 --> 00:07:53,972
Every day spending so much money. 

60
00:07:54,00 --> 00:07:56,972
Describing to me the scene

61
00:07:57,173 --> 00:08:02,514
that I’ll be a “hot news” and all sorts of things, you see,

61.1
00:08:02,573 --> 00:08:05,514
encourage lots of people to come and see you

62
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,188
And she was on and on and on.

63
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,188
And also, she told Dr Warren

64
00:08:13,398 --> 00:08:18,642
except for giving the newspaper [advert] she didn’t
have to pay for it.

65
00:08:22,136 --> 00:08:25,312
It was going too far.

66
00:08:28,677 --> 00:08:33,432
At that juncture, just it was not necessary

67
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:38,982
to go to <i>such</i> a limit and plan it out that there will be people coming

68
00:08:39,183 --> 00:08:42,0
inside the aeroplane to receive me

68.1
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,535
makes no difference to me!

69
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:48,161
And there would be a car waiting near
the aeroplane just to receive me.

70
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:56,067
I don’t know! I don’t know who was waiting
where, at every point!

71
00:08:56,848 --> 00:08:59,459
And when we reached there, it was six
hours late

72
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:04,924
and I told Warren, “It’s all going to be a fizzled out, take it easy!”

73
00:09:07,911 --> 00:09:12,695
And the plane just deposited us in Bangkok!

73.1
00:09:12,911 --> 00:09:17,095
There was no way – six hours.

74
00:09:17,296 --> 00:09:20,415
And we had to take another plane

75
00:09:20,616 --> 00:09:25,646
in which nobody came in

75
00:09:25,656 --> 00:09:27,646
no car

75
00:09:27,656 --> 00:09:28,646
nothing.

76
00:09:28,847 --> 00:09:32,552
We went down looking for her, couldn’t see
her.

77
00:09:32,753 --> 00:09:37,594
Telephoned to the hotel, they said, “No arrangements thrown.”

78
00:09:37,795 --> 00:09:42,585
Warren thought, “Mother has gone to another extreme now!”

79
00:09:44,402 --> 00:09:51,705
Quite worried that there’s no one to receive us at the airport in Hong Kong.

80
00:09:51,983 --> 00:09:54,304
It’s all a joke

81
00:09:54,505 --> 00:10:00,031
Going to extremes has to be corrected in you as well.

82
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:03,910
because if you get successful with your this kind of planning,

83
00:10:04,111 --> 00:10:06,827
then you’ll go on doing this kind of artificial planning

84
00:10:07,028 --> 00:10:10,087
and not the planning of the divine.

85
00:10:10,288 --> 00:10:12,976
The divine has its own plans 

85
00:10:13,00 --> 00:10:15,976
and we have to feel the plans of the divine.

86
00:10:16,177 --> 00:10:20,831
It works it out. You are just an instrument to work it out.

87
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:28,725
So if you try to do something of your own,
something too much,

88
00:10:28,926 --> 00:10:35,162
then who is going to suggest the balance - is Shri Ganesh

89
00:10:35,363 --> 00:10:39,633
And that balance, once it’s established in you

90
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:43,137
you know how you should balance yourself. 

90.1
00:10:43,334 --> 00:10:46,137
Now, there is no alternative

91
00:10:46,338 --> 00:10:50,166
for Sahaj Yog, no alternative. 

91.1
00:10:50,238 --> 00:10:52,166
One must know.

92
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:55,917
Everything that is living has no alternatives.

93
00:10:56,118 --> 00:11:04,626
For example, if a mango tree says that,
“I will create a pomegranate,” it cannot!

94
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:10,354
There’s no alternatives. Whatever is there, it has to see and enjoy;

95
00:11:10,555 --> 00:11:13,393
but not to force its way on it.

96
00:11:13,594 --> 00:11:17,031
This is one of the things we have to understand

97
00:11:17,232 --> 00:11:21,087
to establish our wisdom.

98
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:32,155
Because of our concept, our idea, our anything,

99
00:11:32,356 --> 00:11:40,608
even about God for example, about our achievements itself,

100
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:45,695
can be absolutely wrong if you have no wisdom.

101
00:11:45,896 --> 00:11:54,714
But in nature, if you see, those who grow

102
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:59,111
are never bothered about what shape
they are going to take, do they?

103
00:11:59,312 --> 00:12:05,718
Does a tree measure itself up to know how
many dimensions it is going to grow?

104
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:09,740
It grows as much as it can

104.1
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:12,340
slowly, steadily

105
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:17,644
in coordination with nature itself.

106
00:12:17,845 --> 00:12:28,296
Like that, the wisdom is the one that understands.

107
00:12:29,903 --> 00:12:33,479
 It is an establishment, is a state of mind. 

108
00:12:33,702 --> 00:12:39,877
We can say it’s the state of <i>being</i>, when you become wisdom.

109
00:12:41,726 --> 00:12:49,327
Such a wisdom outside, also expresses so beautifully.

110
00:12:49,528 --> 00:12:55,993
Such a wisdom gives you a gentleman and a gentlelady

111
00:12:59,682 --> 00:13:06,438
only in a personality which is settled down.

112
00:13:06,928 --> 00:13:09,222
If you are frustrated

112.1
00:13:09,228 --> 00:13:11,222
and if there’s a problem

113
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:14,915
if you are unhappy, if you are suppressed

114
00:13:15,116 --> 00:13:24,484
any <i>extremes</i> will not allow this flower of wisdom to grow.

115
00:13:24,685 --> 00:13:27,470
So even in frustration you have to look back,

116
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:30,251
you have to stand back and see for yourself,

117
00:13:30,452 --> 00:13:32,405
“Why am I to be so frustrated?”

118
00:13:32,606 --> 00:13:38,220
Count your blessings one by one.

118.1
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,220
Count your blessings one by one.

119
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:46,634
I’ll say again, <i>count your blessings one by one.</i>

120
00:13:46,835 --> 00:13:48,716
Once you start counting your blessings,

121
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:55,220
you will find in such a short time, where are you.

122
00:13:56,594 --> 00:13:59,831
Now the extreme projections of the mind can take you to:

123
00:14:00,032 --> 00:14:06,231
“I’m not going to face!” and you would like to do it.

124
00:14:11,428 --> 00:14:20,222
But in <i>wise</i> projection, you can see this, that you are what you have to be.

125
00:14:20,423 --> 00:14:23,737
You are saints.

126
00:14:24,747 --> 00:14:28,211
You were born to be saints in this great country.

127
00:14:28,412 --> 00:14:31,788
You are specially blessed people in the heavens,

128
00:14:31,989 --> 00:14:41,390
and are sent on this Earth to do this Maha Yoga, to spread it.

129
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:44,073
You have achieved that state.

130
00:14:44,274 --> 00:14:49,424
And if you are saints, you should not be bothered as to a few things like,

131
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:54,500
“Oh! I haven’t got a suitcase” or something
sort of a thing like that

132
00:14:54,701 --> 00:14:57,622
which you have never been very much bothered before.

133
00:14:57,823 --> 00:15:00,00
Can you see that? 

133.1
00:15:00,123 --> 00:15:03,370
Any kind of extreme behaviour

134
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:07,855
For example, for materialism you people are not so bad

135
00:15:08,056 --> 00:15:14,805
in the sense that you understand the value
of aesthetics.

136
00:15:15,006 --> 00:15:20,282
But in possessiveness let us take the wise
path, the wisdom

137
00:15:20,483 --> 00:15:22,077
logical, it has to be logical

137.1
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:31,077
What do we possess in this world?

138
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,801
Just think of <i>one</i> thing that we can possess!

139
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:39,712
Except for your own Spirit, you don’t possess anything.

140
00:15:39,913 --> 00:15:45,270
Except for your evolutionary development, you don’t possess anything.

141
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:48,440
For example, now you are a saint you’ll be born a saint always

142
00:15:48,641 --> 00:15:52,170
this is what you possess

142.1
00:15:52,241 --> 00:15:53,170
The rest you don’t possess

143
00:15:53,371 --> 00:15:55,258
It’s logical, logical. 

143
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:59,258
You need not to be realised to understand what I am saying.

144
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:07,119
So why should we worry about our possessions?

145
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,225
When you leave this worry, this is another wisdom,

146
00:16:12,426 --> 00:16:14,276
this is the higher wisdom 

146
00:16:14,426 --> 00:16:17,876
which you develop within yourself. 

147
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:22,860
And if we leave our possessions, our material problems are solved.

148
00:16:23,061 --> 00:16:25,500
‘Leave’ doesn’t mean you throw them in the sea, 

149
00:16:25,503 --> 00:16:29,000
but the attachment to it dissolves

149.1
00:16:29,003 --> 00:16:31,497
It is solved.

149.2
00:16:31,503 --> 00:16:33,897
Let me give you an example

150
00:16:34,098 --> 00:16:38,000
Like Kay lost her travellers’ cheques


150.1
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:40,699
she did not know, she was not knowing

151
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,000
Suddenly one man bumped into her.

151.1
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,177
I was with her. 

152
00:16:45,378 --> 00:16:48,589
He said, “Imagine, I never knew I was going to meet you!”

153
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,519
He said, “I went to a particular cashier or somebody"

154
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,903
And he said “Do you know this lady? I’ve got her travellers cheques with me.”

155
00:16:57,104 --> 00:17:00,981
"And here, suddenly, I bump into you!”

156
00:17:01,182 --> 00:17:04,310
How the news has been organised, in the nature you see,

157
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:10,713
when the flowers bloom, how these bees come all the way.

158
00:17:10,914 --> 00:17:18,223
How the birds fly all the way from Siberia to Australia?

159
00:17:18,424 --> 00:17:22,121
What wisdom, is that magnetism in them

159.1
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25,121
the magnetism that is in the Mother Earth

160
00:17:25,322 --> 00:17:33,689
which tells them, “This is the way you have to go.”

161
00:17:34,196 --> 00:17:38,252
So we have to see to this magnetism within us:

162
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:45,303
What makes us magnetic

163
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:49,342
is not what we could have, what unnatural
things we have

164
00:17:49,543 --> 00:17:51,789
but what naturally we have achieved within

165
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,986
and we are not afraid to express it

166
00:17:55,187 --> 00:18:00,286
In fear you are never aggressive

167
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:10,953
but even in fearlessness you are never aggressive

168
00:18:11,154 --> 00:18:17,633
In fear you might say that you are not afraid

169
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:21,636
but you could be aggressive

170
00:18:24,615 --> 00:18:28,283
When people look very frightened, if you push them

171
00:18:28,484 --> 00:18:34,071
to the extreme of fright, they can come back

172
00:18:34,272 --> 00:18:36,686
But if you are fearless, you are innocent

172.1
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,686
you are just standing and watching

173
00:18:43,573 --> 00:18:50,094
Fearlessness never means aggression

174
00:18:51,165 --> 00:18:55,977
So the confusion of our own concepts

175
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:59,000
can only be cleared out

175
00:18:59,001 --> 00:19:01,895
if there is light within us.

176
00:19:02,096 --> 00:19:07,615
For us, if somebody is aggressing us, then we think

177
00:19:07,816 --> 00:19:11,345
[that] if we do not aggress the other
person, we are frightened

178
00:19:11,546 --> 00:19:14,597
then we are useless,

178.1
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,997
we are weak, we are weak people

179
00:19:20,148 --> 00:19:22,000
so we should fight back. 

179.1
00:19:22,148 --> 00:19:26,698
Even when you are fighting back, you are weak people.

180
00:19:27,673 --> 00:19:32,825
If it was not so, what is there to fight
back?

181
00:19:33,026 --> 00:19:37,805
In fearlessness you become the witness.

182
00:19:38,006 --> 00:19:40,102
You see the joke

182
00:19:40,116 --> 00:19:44,102
joke behind all this extreme behaviour of another person.

183
00:19:44,303 --> 00:19:48,420
And also you know the technique, kaushalam.

184
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:51,436
Yoga also means kaushalam, it means technique

184.1
00:19:51,621 --> 00:19:53,436
how to manage the show

185
00:19:53,637 --> 00:20:00,201
by which his action doesn’t trouble you

185.1
00:20:01,00 --> 00:20:03,201
if you want to.

186
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:08,024
If you don’t want, you can even take
the action upon yourself, to prove it

187
00:20:08,225 --> 00:20:12,793
that, “Whatever you are doing is a little
silly and stupid.”

188
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:16,795
Like Christ getting Himself crucified.

189
00:20:17,563 --> 00:20:21,741
It was a wise decision to do

190
00:20:23,313 --> 00:20:26,948
because if you have to prove that life is eternal

191
00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:30,592
the best thing is to die and show.

192
00:20:30,793 --> 00:20:35,358
And to be [done] publicly, so that nobody
should say that he was not dead.

193
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:39,218
Still there are many people who are saying he was not dead.

194
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:42,874
Still there are people who are talking this: “He was not dead.

195
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:47,123
He was alive. So he got out of the place.”

196
00:20:47,324 --> 00:20:51,657
Because they don’t know how to explain!

197
00:20:51,966 --> 00:20:58,299
So he had to die publicly

198
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:05,285
and then his resurrection was to be seen
by many people.

199
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:13,961
This drama had to be performed

200
00:21:14,162 --> 00:21:21,716
for you to have the wisdom to know that life is eternal.

201
00:21:22,835 --> 00:21:27,627
It doesn’t mean that he was weak, by any chance.

202
00:21:32,136 --> 00:21:37,642
So the idea of our aggression, or our suppression

203
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:45,301
Both come from either fear

203.1
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:54,301
or some sort of a satanic pleasure

203.2
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,301
to oppress others

204
00:21:58,686 --> 00:22:03,977
So wisdom lies in seeing yourself also

205
00:22:04,502 --> 00:22:07,275
See how wisdom is so important!

206
00:22:07,476 --> 00:22:12,748
Throughout if you find, in every chakra resides pranava

207
00:22:12,949 --> 00:22:15,696
is the life of every chakra.

208
00:22:15,897 --> 00:22:21,605
Because it is the <i>wisdom</i> that tells you whether you are in the chakra or not.

209
00:22:22,797 --> 00:22:24,692
So how wisdom is [so] important


209.1
00:22:24,797 --> 00:22:27,300
that you even become a sakshi if you have wisdom

210
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,154
otherwise you cannot

211
00:22:28,355 --> 00:22:34,599
You become a witness <i>only</i> when you have that focal point

211.1
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:42,000
adjusted to your centre of gravity

212
00:22:42,324 --> 00:22:45,550
That is wisdom!

213
00:22:46,561 --> 00:22:49,427
When people tell me about somebody who has harmed them

214
00:22:49,628 --> 00:22:54,461
they paint such a dark picture of the whole thing

215
00:22:54,662 --> 00:23:01,458
as if it was another war that was fought.

216
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:05,287
Then you go and listen to another side,

217
00:23:05,488 --> 00:23:10,885
they paint another horrible picture
of this side.

218
00:23:11,317 --> 00:23:16,567
Between these two pictures you stand.

219
00:23:16,768 --> 00:23:22,271
You find the one is reflecting the other,
the other is reflecting the other.

220
00:23:24,998 --> 00:23:32,352
There is no end to it, it’s eternally going
on from this to that, to that to this.

221
00:23:34,841 --> 00:23:38,519
How do you end it up?

222
00:23:39,286 --> 00:23:47,762
Only by your wisdom, by understanding it’s an illusion.

223
00:23:47,963 --> 00:23:52,172
The main thing is the mirror on which it is reflected,

224
00:23:52,373 --> 00:23:58,710
It’s just an illusion that is appearing, and we are worried about it.

225
00:23:58,911 --> 00:24:03,248
The whole illusion will drop out as soon as you just see the mirror

226
00:24:03,449 --> 00:24:07,462
and don’t worry about the reflections.

227
00:24:09,846 --> 00:24:15,377
They’ll come and go: it is for you just to witness it, that’s all.

228
00:24:15,578 --> 00:24:20,201
It’s not..the mirror is a mirror, which is a solid thing,

229
00:24:20,411 --> 00:24:24,524
and all the reflections are illusions.

230
00:24:26,843 --> 00:24:35,728
That’s how we miss all the sweetness of our own being.

231
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:46,598
Wisdom lies in understanding that you are the Spirit.

232
00:24:46,805 --> 00:24:49,800
You are not all these illusions. You are the Spirit.


232.1
00:24:49,805 --> 00:24:53,492
You are the Spirit.

233
00:24:53,735 --> 00:24:57,601
The attention was, as animals, was on food only, you can say.

234
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:01,752
You were aware of food, nothing else but food only.

235
00:25:01,953 --> 00:25:04,556
This grows higher and higher in awareness,

236
00:25:04,757 --> 00:25:08,000
then he came up to a point where he started thinking that

237
00:25:08,194 --> 00:25:11,000
he is the prime minister

237.1
00:25:11,194 --> 00:25:13,414
or he is an actor or an actress

238
00:25:13,615 --> 00:25:17,237
and this and that and so-called things they have achieved.

239
00:25:17,438 --> 00:25:23,045
Or maybe they start thinking - oh, they are atheists

240
00:25:23,246 --> 00:25:25,194
agnostics and all sorts of things, you see.

240.1
00:25:25,246 --> 00:25:28,194
Communists!

240.2
00:25:28,246 --> 00:25:34,194
And specialists!

241
00:25:41,116 --> 00:25:43,000
It’s a drama going on!

241.1
00:25:43,516 --> 00:25:45,859
They are wearing wigs after wigs.


242
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,967
If they like this wig they’ll wear this, otherwise throw away!

243
00:25:49,168 --> 00:25:52,026
This has killed the romance <i>completely!</i>

244
00:25:52,227 --> 00:25:56,682
You start loving the wigs of a person!

245
00:25:59,317 --> 00:26:03,076
And wigs can be bought!

245.1
00:26:05,00 --> 00:26:07,076
They could be exchanged.


246
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:12,905
If you go into the market, you can get about ten types of wigs.

247
00:26:13,106 --> 00:26:19,055
Supposing you say, “Oh, I like this colour for the hair,”

248
00:26:19,256 --> 00:26:23,871
so the lady will go and wear that and come out

249
00:26:24,072 --> 00:26:27,846
and then you’ll like her for the wig that she has got

250
00:26:28,047 --> 00:26:32,637
Then another may wear the same

251
00:26:32,838 --> 00:26:40,721
Or this same lady, who looks nice with one wig,

252
00:26:40,922 --> 00:26:43,303
could bore you completely!

253
00:26:43,504 --> 00:26:52,037
Because there’s no living dynamism, that charisma

254
00:26:52,238 --> 00:26:56,208
Every moment is so beautiful

254.1
00:26:56,238 --> 00:26:58,248
It breaks into new waves


255
00:26:58,349 --> 00:27:02,175
of such beautiful colours and beautiful music.

256
00:27:02,376 --> 00:27:08,419
That’s all lost with these bought images.

257
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:14,139
Every minute the image changes, with a living personality,

258
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,913
into tremendous beauty.

258.1
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,913
But the first point is the wisdom

259
00:27:18,114 --> 00:27:20,840
to know that our images cannot be purchased

260
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:24,00
or bought or created or made.

260.1
00:27:24,041 --> 00:27:27,675
<i>They evolve!</i>

261
00:27:29,026 --> 00:27:32,283
So we have to only see to our evolving force..

262
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,312
are we nearer it or are we out of it?

263
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:40,00
Are we moving with our evolving force 

264
00:27:40,195 --> 00:27:44,031
Of getting ourselves crucified

264.1
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:52,231
with all these artificial misidentifications that says that,

265
00:27:52,432 --> 00:27:54,300
You are this, you are that.

265.1
00:27:54,432 --> 00:27:56,850
You are nothing but a seeker.

266
00:27:57,051 --> 00:27:59,535
It’s a category, I have told many-a-times

266.1
00:27:59,651 --> 00:28:01,535
that you are a seeker and you have to seek

267
00:28:01,736 --> 00:28:05,513
Now, what do you seek? Is your Spirit.

268
00:28:05,714 --> 00:28:08,549
And once you have found it, establish yourself on that. 

268.1
00:28:08,714 --> 00:28:09,849
That’s what you are!

269
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:16,321
And to know that you are that Spirit itself is so satisfying

270
00:28:16,522 --> 00:28:22,341
is itself emitting wisdom in you

270.1
00:28:22,422 --> 00:28:25,000
Which is so joy giving

271
00:28:25,142 --> 00:28:27,000
and is nothing but love

271.1
00:28:27,142 --> 00:28:28,941
It’s love, I tell you!

272
00:28:29,142 --> 00:28:31,507
I mean, I cannot go beyond this.

273
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:39,140
There’s no word in human language to say
what is love.

274
00:28:39,341 --> 00:28:43,237
To me it is nothing but silence.

274.1
00:28:43,341 --> 00:28:46,737
Everything stops at that point.

275
00:28:46,938 --> 00:28:51,719
This feeling within yourself, where the wisdom is becoming love,

276
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,123
and love becomes wisdom.

276.1
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:59,123
that’s the real integration of life.

277
00:28:59,324 --> 00:29:01,962
Open your hearts!

277.1
00:29:02,00 --> 00:29:08,000
Allow Shri Ganesha to be settled in that

278
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:11,246
That innocence which enhances everything.

279
00:29:11,447 --> 00:29:13,291
Look at the little ones.

279.1
00:29:13,447 --> 00:29:15,291
How they came forward to give me flowers.

280
00:29:15,492 --> 00:29:20,740
Every step, every movement was so joyous

281
00:29:20,941 --> 00:29:25,443
was creating such a beautiful, delicate ripple in my heart.

282
00:29:25,644 --> 00:29:30,092
And it’s written as history for me,

283
00:29:30,293 --> 00:29:37,159
to see these little, little sweet, innocent Ganeshas coming forward

284
00:29:37,545 --> 00:29:41,930
And the wisdom becomes so powerful

285
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:46,648
that you know the source of love as Ganesha in you.

286
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:49,534
For him, he did not know anybody else but one

286.1
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,834
That which is the source of love.

287
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,832
Never questioned, never argued. No alternatives!

288
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:07,969
No new ideas came to his mind.

288.1
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,969
It's just taking in.

289
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:17,780
Working it out within yourself and the whole thing just works out.

290
00:30:17,981 --> 00:30:22,780
The more you enter into it, you will
understand that you have really entered

291
00:30:22,981 --> 00:30:26,207
into the Kingdom of God where he looks after everyone.

292
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,0
You want a house? All right, have it!

293
00:30:28,075 --> 00:30:32,187
What do you want? You want that? Alright!

293
00:30:32,275 --> 00:30:33,187
You have a problem? Have it.

294
00:30:33,388 --> 00:30:37,480
It’s all God’s, the own thing. Who owns it but God?

295
00:30:37,681 --> 00:30:41,978
He is the One who owns everything and He’s
the One who enjoys everything.

296
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:45,679
And he wants you to enjoy everything.

297
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:52,802
Only through the power of your wisdom that you can achieve it

298
00:30:53,003 --> 00:31:01,356
Today, You all have to show a part of that achievement in your wisdom

299
00:31:01,557 --> 00:31:07,433
in which there is no artificiality. It’s so natural.

300
00:31:08,586 --> 00:31:13,660
But natural doesn’t mean baser. Some
people think to be angry is also natural.

301
00:31:13,861 --> 00:31:17,718
But you are a human being and
a Sahaja Yogi.

302
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,778
Whatever is natural to a Sahaja Yogi

303
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:26,060
is not the same as whatever is natural
to a buffalo.

304
00:31:27,033 --> 00:31:31,605
We have nothing to learn from them,
they have to learn from us.

305
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:35,864
So whatever is natural to a Sahaja Yogi

306
00:31:36,065 --> 00:31:39,916
has to be learnt in the school of wisdom.

307
00:31:40,117 --> 00:31:43,561
Not by any rules or anything

308
00:31:43,762 --> 00:31:46,361
that I say, “You don’t do this,” and, “You do this!”

309
00:31:46,562 --> 00:31:51,929
“You are not to do like that.” “You are not
to do this way!”

310
00:31:54,952 --> 00:32:03,355
Even in the hand if you see: this portion is Australia.

311
00:32:04,136 --> 00:32:09,832
Now just see: this portion is the source for all the fingers

312
00:32:10,033 --> 00:32:13,383
is the connecting point, this is your point

312.1
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:17,783
But it doesn’t say anything!

313
00:32:17,984 --> 00:32:21,488
For example, this thumb means something,

314
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,00
this finger means something

314.1
00:32:23,001 --> 00:32:24,137
this means something

315
00:32:24,338 --> 00:32:29,258
but this doesn’t say anything, doesn’t do anything.

316
00:32:29,459 --> 00:32:32,455
But without this nothing exists.

317
00:32:32,656 --> 00:32:37,973
If it is cut out here, you are paralysed,
all the movements are finished, you see.

318
00:32:38,174 --> 00:32:47,516
This is the connecting link with the divine
and the guiding link.

319
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:49,557
This only tells which finger to move

319.1
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:52,557
where to take, how to contract which muscle.

320
00:32:52,758 --> 00:32:58,740
All of this is controlled in this portion.

321
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:07,956
The day will come when the information
will reach the whole world

322
00:33:08,157 --> 00:33:13,039
through the awakening of Ganesha in my children

322.1
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:16,039
the Sahaja Yogis in Australia.

323
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:22,505
And the whole world is going to get the blessings coming into it

324
00:33:22,706 --> 00:33:26,184
Of course, you know that Kundalini is in India

324
00:33:26,706 --> 00:33:31,184
and only then the Kundalini can rise.

325
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:39,698
But one thing you have to remember

326
00:33:40,142 --> 00:33:46,995
is that you are really placed at a very pivotal point here

327
00:33:47,196 --> 00:33:52,132
and that the responsibility is too much on you.

328
00:33:53,317 --> 00:33:59,925
And the responsibility is to keep the whole atmosphere pure

329
00:34:00,126 --> 00:34:04,120
and send forth all the fragrance of the lotus.

330
00:34:04,321 --> 00:34:10,786
Though maybe you will feel you are surrounded by all the mud and everything,

331
00:34:10,987 --> 00:34:17,092
but still you have to be very strong lotuses.

332
00:34:17,293 --> 00:34:22,597
For the whole world you have to come up

333
00:34:22,773 --> 00:34:28,050
and send forth that beautiful fragrance

334
00:34:28,251 --> 00:34:34,867
of announcement that the Blossom Time has come.

335
00:34:36,211 --> 00:34:39,040
I was asking for the river’s name

335.1
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:41,040
what’s the name of the river

336
00:34:41,241 --> 00:34:44,657
I wonder if you thought about it

336.1
00:34:44,741 --> 00:34:47,657
See, the river’s name is ‘Parramatta’

337
00:34:47,858 --> 00:34:53,010
‘Para’ in Greek means ‘above, beyond’ should be Para

338
00:34:53,211 --> 00:34:57,000
And ‘Mata’ means ‘the mother’

338.1
00:34:58,211 --> 00:35:01,979
Your river’s name itself is Parramatta.

339
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:08,662
It’s a Greek word and how the Greeks
have known this word ‘Parramatta’?

340
00:35:08,863 --> 00:35:12,884
This river had to be here, the Adi Shakti itself only, had to be here

341
00:35:13,085 --> 00:35:17,097
to bless the Ganesha all the time which has to do the work.

342
00:35:17,298 --> 00:35:22,273
He’s the one who sorts out

342.1
00:35:22,298 --> 00:35:24,673
The Lambodara!

343
00:35:26,162 --> 00:35:32,675
The one you will see in the Sistine Chapel, very well pointed out.

344
00:35:32,876 --> 00:35:34,581
It’s a huge big stomach. 

344.1
00:35:34,606 --> 00:35:37,000
It’s really an Australian character, personality,

345
00:35:38,782 --> 00:35:46,039
standing there, sorting out people,
throwing left to the right.

346
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,194
It’s so beautiful, I wish you could get
that picture some time.

347
00:35:50,395 --> 00:35:55,148
And you will be surprised – it’s an
Australian. you can see it perfectly -

348
00:35:55,349 --> 00:35:58,447
it’s Australian character.

349
00:35:58,648 --> 00:36:04,936
That is Christ, absolutely an Australian
body, standing up.

350
00:36:05,137 --> 00:36:09,330
I don’t know how Michelangelo could see that so clearly

351
00:36:09,531 --> 00:36:14,581
that he had to be Australian like that.

352
00:36:20,201 --> 00:36:26,353
It has been so beautiful to come down here.

352
00:36:26,401 --> 00:36:28,353
So beautiful.

353
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:38,420
It’s blissful for you maybe, but for me it’s nothing but complete joy.

353
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:43,420
complete joy.

354
00:36:45,104 --> 00:36:52,707
I had told that I will not do anything
after three years time;

355
00:36:52,908 --> 00:36:54,281
I will just settle down

355.1
00:36:54,298 --> 00:36:57,281
because the saintly person is not supposed

356
00:36:57,482 --> 00:36:59,904
to move from places to places, they must settle down,

357
00:37:00,105 --> 00:37:04,868
they must have their own round pillow that’s called as takiya,

358
00:37:05,069 --> 00:37:06,827
and you are not to leave that. 

358
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:12,827
But I am a Mother who is moving all over.

359
00:37:13,028 --> 00:37:18,939
And can you imagine, I’ve been all over
the places, but never to Australia before.

360
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:27,920
So to come here first thing was so great
that even,

361
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:33,011
today I have not been able to put
all that into words.

362
00:37:33,212 --> 00:37:36,711
May God bless you all.

363
00:38:00,755 --> 00:38:06,613
You are really the Ganeshas, the amount
of food you have.
