00:00:03.493 --> 00:00:06.803
Actually Christians do not know anything about His becoming.

00:00:07.201 --> 00:00:11.076
How He became Christ or what was the need

00:00:11.396 --> 00:00:14.625
to have Christ or a son to come down.

00:00:14.696 --> 00:00:16.854
Why not God Himself could do the job.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.390
And this is the reason why I would request you to read

00:00:20.663 --> 00:00:24.777
for yourself the incarnation of

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.375
Maha Vishnu by which you realize why Christ was born.

00:00:30.053 --> 00:00:33.914
And it is the most important incarnation

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:39.323
because He is the principle.

00:00:40.651 --> 00:00:43.917
He is the principle of creation.

00:00:44.612 --> 00:00:47.269
The Tattwa as they call it in Sanskrit language.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.450
He is the tattwa.

00:00:49.157 --> 00:00:52.349
Ganesha, who resides in the Mooladhara

00:00:53.316 --> 00:00:58.440
gradually evolves to be Christ at this stage.

00:00:59.224 --> 00:01:04.963
From that red Chakra up to this Chakra He became the Christ.

00:01:06.865 --> 00:01:11.689
He is the principle. Now what is the principle?

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:17.490
Within us what is our principle?

00:01:17.948 --> 00:01:20.043
Is say the Kundalini you can say?

00:01:21.162 --> 00:01:24.491
In this the electricity is the principle of this one is.

00:01:25.007 --> 00:01:27.007
In the same way the creation,

00:01:28.337 --> 00:01:30.667
the whole creation if you take it as such,

00:01:30.895 --> 00:01:35.338
it is the principle and the support of this creation.

00:01:38.188 --> 00:01:46.515
He represents, He represents the essence,

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.869
the essence of creation.

00:01:49.351 --> 00:01:52.191
Like we can say we have a family,

00:01:52.526 --> 00:01:55.138
husband and wife and the child.

00:01:55.814 --> 00:01:59.788
Now the child is the essence of husband and wife.

00:02:01.807 --> 00:02:05.374
He is the essence of the family, of the house.

00:02:05.998 --> 00:02:11.256
The whole thing is sustained for him, is created for him.

00:02:11.864 --> 00:02:13.861
Till they did not have the child

00:02:15.517 --> 00:02:18.160
there was no meaning to that house,

00:02:18.358 --> 00:02:19.786
no meaning to their life.

00:02:20.184 --> 00:02:21.801
But when they had a child

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.118
then they had a meaning.

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:26.062
In the same way Christ is the essence,

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.820
is the tattwa itself.

00:02:28.104 --> 00:02:29.802
He’s the Omkara as they call it.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.193
He is the first sound,

00:02:33.675 --> 00:02:36.097
first sound that was created AUM

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:40.952
when the Primordial Father and Primordial Mother separated,

00:02:41.298 --> 00:02:42.714
They created this sound.

00:02:42.773 --> 00:02:44.529
And He is that sound

00:02:45.095 --> 00:02:48.090
which is filled into All-Pervading Power

00:02:48.257 --> 00:02:52.491
and looks after and supports,

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:54.972
actually it is more the support

00:02:54.997 --> 00:02:57.249
because looking after is done by the Father

00:02:57.441 --> 00:02:58.627
you can say or by the Mother.

00:02:58.713 --> 00:03:02.312
But is the support of all the universe.

00:03:06.334 --> 00:03:10.364
And because He is just the essence, the essence never dies.

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:15.782
Say My essence is My Spirit,

00:03:16.207 --> 00:03:17.523
it will never die.

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:21.840
The body dies or the creation will die

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:24.151
but the essence has to be there.

00:03:24.733 --> 00:03:27.486
If the essence is lost then nothing could be there

00:03:27.637 --> 00:03:31.025
that’s why He is the most important incarnation.

00:03:31.236 --> 00:03:33.218
Because He is the support.

00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:39.942
Now this incarnation is placed in this Agnya Chakra of ours.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.968
Here in the center where

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.635
the optic nerve or optic thalamus cross each other like this.

00:03:46.714 --> 00:03:48.941
In the center is a very subtle point

00:03:50.061 --> 00:03:52.912
which moves both the sides like this and like that

00:03:53.797 --> 00:03:58.576
and it creates two sounds Ham Ksham, Ham Ksham, Ham Ksham.

00:04:00.818 --> 00:04:04.877
Ham is on the right hand side where you have seen

00:04:05.783 --> 00:04:08.433
the superego is there

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:13.162
and Ksham is on the left hand side where the ego is.

00:04:13.736 --> 00:04:16.260
Now these two sounds create

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.653
two kinds of vibrations.

00:04:21.224 --> 00:04:28.344
The Ham sound creates the vibrations,

00:04:28.502 --> 00:04:31.144
which make you think, “I am, I am.

00:04:32.948 --> 00:04:34.307
Ham, I am.”

00:04:35.746 --> 00:04:37.971
This comes from our existence power

00:04:38.024 --> 00:04:40.082
that we know we have to live in this world,

00:04:40.335 --> 00:04:41.577
we’re not going to die.

00:04:41.874 --> 00:04:45.604
Any human being who tries to kill himself is abnormal.

00:04:46.136 --> 00:04:48.769
Normally every human being,

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.794
why every animal or any living thing tries to retain its life.

00:04:55.158 --> 00:04:58.578
That is through this power of Ham that I am.

00:04:59.595 --> 00:05:01.478
Now the superego on the left hand side

00:05:01.493 --> 00:05:04.098
and the ego on the right hand side is Ksham.

00:05:05.418 --> 00:05:08.905
But now I’ll tell you about the right hand side superego.

00:05:10.633 --> 00:05:15.963
In this superego when you are

00:05:16.162 --> 00:05:21.176
conditioned by so many things, then you are frightened

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:25.951
and you are worried because these experiences

00:05:26.161 --> 00:05:30.762
make you that type of a person which has fear in the mind.

00:05:31.386 --> 00:05:34.600
And this fear is all settled in your superego.

00:05:35.056 --> 00:05:37.636
This starts from your amoeba stage you can say

00:05:37.854 --> 00:05:40.257
and is still today is being stored there.

00:05:40.308 --> 00:05:42.791
You are afraid of police, you are afraid of that,

00:05:42.935 --> 00:05:43.920
you are afraid of this.

00:05:44.097 --> 00:05:46.052
Some people are not afraid of these things

00:05:46.066 --> 00:05:47.604
but are afraid of something else.

00:05:47.791 --> 00:05:50.793
Because whatever have been your conditions,

00:05:51.427 --> 00:05:54.796
whatever have been your experiences

00:05:54.912 --> 00:05:56.860
are all put down here.

00:05:57.188 --> 00:05:59.905
Moreover when somebody reads the book of “Dracula”

00:06:00.016 --> 00:06:01.586
now he’s afraid of the word Dracula

00:06:01.705 --> 00:06:03.296
but the children who do not read

00:06:03.462 --> 00:06:05.009
they do not know what is a Dracula is.

00:06:05.037 --> 00:06:06.458
If you say Dracula has come they say

00:06:06.478 --> 00:06:07.862
all right lets have a look at him.

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:11.687
But those children have read about Dracula,

00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:13.068
they are literally frightened and

00:06:13.092 --> 00:06:14.769
they say, “Oh God, Dracula is coming,

00:06:14.792 --> 00:06:16.174
something terrible is going to happen.”

00:06:16.645 --> 00:06:18.432
So you see whatever you have read,

00:06:18.547 --> 00:06:20.155
whatever you have gone through

00:06:20.252 --> 00:06:22.029
whatever experiences you have had

00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:24.562
all is in the superego.

00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:32.844
So this superego in that this center sends message,

00:06:33.087 --> 00:06:37.603
I am, you are, you are Ham, Ham don’t be afraid,

00:06:37.685 --> 00:06:39.179
don’t be afraid, you are.

00:06:40.647 --> 00:06:43.523
So the people who come to Me, and you have seen

00:06:43.545 --> 00:06:46.631
some people who come to Me are victims of

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.875
superego conditioning.

00:06:49.174 --> 00:06:50.457
And these are the people,

00:06:50.552 --> 00:06:53.514
actually at this stage only you can really discriminate

00:06:53.703 --> 00:06:54.702
between the two types.

00:06:55.097 --> 00:06:56.652
One who are very aggressive,

00:06:56.742 --> 00:06:59.106
the other who are absolutely

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:05.110
we should say subordinated, frightened.

00:07:05.761 --> 00:07:08.677
These people when they come to Me

00:07:08.705 --> 00:07:10.733
I have seen, they go on crying and weeping,

00:07:10.775 --> 00:07:13.986
“Mother you know this has happened that has happened,” and

00:07:14.106 --> 00:07:16.470
I really get tired talking to them.

00:07:16.684 --> 00:07:19.769
And there are so many of this kind

00:07:19.956 --> 00:07:22.018
that really you have to

00:07:22.036 --> 00:07:23.951
pay attention to them as Sahaja Yogis

00:07:24.038 --> 00:07:26.459
because you’ll have to deal with them, how to,

00:07:26.606 --> 00:07:28.587
how to manage them and how to work it out.

00:07:28.965 --> 00:07:31.320
Now at that time if a Sahaja yogi says,

00:07:31.552 --> 00:07:35.464
now you go on saying Ham, Ham, Ham, Ham,

00:07:35.606 --> 00:07:37.456
a Sahaja Yogi if he says

00:07:37.554 --> 00:07:40.347
then the vibrations will drive out his fear.

00:07:40.964 --> 00:07:43.210
Even if you are under any fear

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.015
and you are walking around and you feel that there’s

00:07:46.125 --> 00:07:48.788
frightened, you just say Ham, Ham, Ham.

00:07:48.954 --> 00:07:52.722
Now with this saying the vibrations will clear out

00:07:52.859 --> 00:07:55.353
this side very nicely.

00:07:55.364 --> 00:07:59.122
Apart from that, that is the way you can get help

00:07:59.176 --> 00:08:01.359
from the Divine by saying Ham.

00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:04.783
Now there are many things about Ham and Ksham but

00:08:04.815 --> 00:08:06.284
as the time is you know,

00:08:06.384 --> 00:08:09.081
so I do not want to go into great details about it.

00:08:09.335 --> 00:08:10.708
But I would say the mantra

00:08:10.909 --> 00:08:13.051
for the right hand side is Ham

00:08:14.156 --> 00:08:16.401
and for the left hand side is Ksham.

00:08:18.087 --> 00:08:19.854
The right hand side is the ego,

00:08:20.312 --> 00:08:23.061
which is real problem, you understand that,

00:08:23.332 --> 00:08:27.370
is a real colossal one you have to face them, I mean.

00:08:27.662 --> 00:08:30.965
I say anything small here and there I find the whole thing

00:08:30.995 --> 00:08:32.978
coming up onto my head like that.

00:08:33.364 --> 00:08:36.594
So what is the solution for a colossal ego?

00:08:37.132 --> 00:08:43.864
Colossal ego can only be conquered by forgiving others.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.243
Those who have ego must learn

00:08:49.773 --> 00:08:51.773
if they feel hurt they must say, “forgive.”

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.730
Then another person hurts them, say, “forgive.”

00:08:56.442 --> 00:08:59.724
And not only forgive but ask for forgiveness.

00:09:00.121 --> 00:09:03.427
Both things should be done, more asking for forgiveness.

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:07.707
You have to ask for forgiveness if you have too much of ego.

00:09:07.749 --> 00:09:08.938
It is very important.

00:09:09.107 --> 00:09:12.265
Because if you have too much of ego means what?

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.360
That you have pampered it too much.

00:09:15.085 --> 00:09:17.251
That means you have used it too much.

00:09:17.592 --> 00:09:19.592
You have dominated people

00:09:19.745 --> 00:09:22.089
and that’s why you have such a lot of ego.

00:09:22.475 --> 00:09:24.475
If you have such a lot of ego

00:09:24.555 --> 00:09:28.155
you must all the time try to humble down in your heart.

00:09:28.755 --> 00:09:31.048
Now in the heart resides the Spirit.

00:09:32.164 --> 00:09:35.358
The ego, too much of ego in a person

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.193
always takes you away from that Spirit.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.849
That’s why it is said, “Humble down in your heart.”

00:09:41.367 --> 00:09:43.225
The reason is, in the heart

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:48.795
resides that part of yours which gets completely obliterated

00:09:48.809 --> 00:09:53.286
or forgotten once you start pumping up your ego.

00:09:53.946 --> 00:09:59.108
But ego has its limits, it ends up into stupidity and foolishness.

00:10:00.358 --> 00:10:02.911
You take any person who is egoistical

00:10:03.799 --> 00:10:06.120
and who’s blowing his own trumpet.

00:10:06.306 --> 00:10:09.285
You will immediately know because he’ll be stupid.

00:10:10.598 --> 00:10:13.135
Without understanding what he’s doing

00:10:13.566 --> 00:10:15.289
he’ll be doing such stupid things

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:18.084
that you will start wondering, especially children,

00:10:18.184 --> 00:10:21.024
“What’s the matter with this fellow, he is quite funny?”

00:10:23.194 --> 00:10:25.953
And then the stupidity you see faces the person

00:10:26.115 --> 00:10:28.289
then he sees for himself, “Oh God!

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:31.380
how did I become so stupid?”

00:10:31.843 --> 00:10:34.142
The stupidity comes to you because

00:10:34.169 --> 00:10:36.452
you forget the existence of God

00:10:36.565 --> 00:10:39.118
and your relationship with the whole.

00:10:41.045 --> 00:10:42.510
You think, “I am on my own.

00:10:43.156 --> 00:10:44.682
Why should I not do this?

00:10:45.306 --> 00:10:46.577
What is wrong in this,

00:10:47.061 --> 00:10:48.317
what is wrong in that?

00:10:48.768 --> 00:10:49.826
I should do these things.”

00:10:49.835 --> 00:10:53.009
I mean in this country the way people are fighting for things.

00:10:53.327 --> 00:10:57.639
I mean you must, anybody I mean, those so-called developing countries

00:10:57.835 --> 00:11:01.921
can’t understand what kind of a thing happening to these people.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:05.759
Because the other day My son-in-law Lav was reading

00:11:05.907 --> 00:11:09.521
an article that people are demanding now that

00:11:09.591 --> 00:11:12.442
the son-in-law should be allowed to marry the mother-in-law.

00:11:12.546 --> 00:11:16.249
And he just couldn’t understand how can people gather together

00:11:16.379 --> 00:11:20.027
and ask for such an absurd thing like that. She is your mother.

00:11:20.117 --> 00:11:21.570
How can you say that way?

00:11:21.879 --> 00:11:24.155
I mean it is something an impossibility

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:27.409
for people, normal people to think like that.

00:11:27.574 --> 00:11:28.577
That a son-in-law

00:11:28.668 --> 00:11:29.846
can marry the mother-in-law.

00:11:29.882 --> 00:11:31.624
And what is there to make a law about it

00:11:31.687 --> 00:11:34.176
and to talk about it. It’s a very difficult thing.

00:11:35.103 --> 00:11:38.050
All kinds of stupid things we are doing in this country,

00:11:38.115 --> 00:11:41.458
which really makes everybody roar with laughter.

00:11:42.657 --> 00:11:46.997
Is because of our Mr. Ego companionship.

00:11:47.592 --> 00:11:51.129
It is not easy to understand how he befools us.

00:11:51.502 --> 00:11:54.328
It goes on befooling us all the time

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:56.107
and then we think what’s wrong?

00:11:56.426 --> 00:11:58.144
An eighty-year-old man

00:11:58.925 --> 00:12:00.925
running after a twenty-year-old girl.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.077
And the twenty-year-old girl befooling this

00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:07.035
eighty-year-old man, supposed to be a statesman this, that

00:12:07.125 --> 00:12:09.831
and his statue is erected somewhere there.

00:12:10.209 --> 00:12:11.618
How is it possible?

00:12:14.015 --> 00:12:18.934
It is only the ego makes you do all these nonsensical and

00:12:19.053 --> 00:12:19.865
stupid things.

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:21.775
Once you are in Sahaja Yoga

00:12:21.907 --> 00:12:24.599
you don’t know how to control your laughter sometimes the way

00:12:24.768 --> 00:12:26.269
people are foolish.

00:12:26.647 --> 00:12:27.964
Extremely foolish.

00:12:28.122 --> 00:12:32.830
And this is what it is; it ends up in stupidity absolute stupidity.

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:36.502
I mean even if you want to write a novel

00:12:36.522 --> 00:12:38.761
you won’t get such beautiful characters

00:12:38.867 --> 00:12:41.254
as you could around you, when you listen to them.

00:12:41.281 --> 00:12:43.333
And you’re shocked, Oh God what’s this going on

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.166
and very embarrassing too.

00:12:45.452 --> 00:12:51.813
Extremely embarrassing and they become so foolish

00:12:51.925 --> 00:12:59.528
with their ego that one cannot understand how thinking man,

00:12:59.813 --> 00:13:01.813
because by thinking you get your ego,

00:13:02.169 --> 00:13:03.619
becomes foolish.

00:13:05.137 --> 00:13:07.022
There is no wisdom

00:13:07.824 --> 00:13:11.250
in a person whose ego is completely developed like that.

00:13:11.738 --> 00:13:15.696
If somebody has an ego like that there is no wisdom in him.

00:13:15.898 --> 00:13:18.674
You can see that he does not know what is wisdom.

00:13:19.823 --> 00:13:22.059
He behaves in such an immature way.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.581
He may be an elderly man, great grandfather of

00:13:25.595 --> 00:13:28.957
somebody but as soon as he opens his mouth you are shocked at him.

00:13:29.143 --> 00:13:31.053
You think from where this joker has come?

00:13:32.961 --> 00:13:34.852
The maturity is completely lacking.

00:13:34.862 --> 00:13:36.818
The other day somebody told Me that,

00:13:36.852 --> 00:13:41.597
“Mother how is it our parents are so stupid and we are searching God?

00:13:43.138 --> 00:13:47.025
And the elderly people are so foolish and we are searching God?”

00:13:48.117 --> 00:13:49.946
And then I said, “No, maybe because of war

00:13:49.985 --> 00:13:51.615
the parents are disturbed, you see”.

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:53.716
Most of the parents were disturbed during war

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:56.396
and they said, “Majority of them are like this.

00:13:56.975 --> 00:14:00.023
And the younger people are searching God and much wiser

00:14:00.287 --> 00:14:02.099
and we don’t know how to compromise with them

00:14:02.126 --> 00:14:03.557
because they are not searching God.

00:14:04.447 --> 00:14:07.310
Why is it they are not searching God and we are searching God?

00:14:07.679 --> 00:14:10.432
And if there are some searching, they are very few.”

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.087
Now I said this may be due to war but somebody said,

00:14:14.101 --> 00:14:15.616
“Then what about America? You see,

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.113
in America the people didn’t face war so much,

00:14:18.305 --> 00:14:21.428
the stupidity that they have is sometimes surprising.”

00:14:24.418 --> 00:14:26.684
That is the same thing as I said,

00:14:26.976 --> 00:14:29.968
is the development of ego in a human being.

00:14:30.733 --> 00:14:35.593
Now ego is the thing that makes you think about everything.

00:14:36.358 --> 00:14:37.537
For example, now

00:14:38.062 --> 00:14:42.033
we have to, say go from here to Birmingham, all right.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:43.928
So we think now how will I go?

00:14:45.491 --> 00:14:48.058
Simple way is that I’ll take a train or I’ll

00:14:48.087 --> 00:14:49.924
take a car and go away.

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.795
If there’s no reservation needed I will

00:14:51.809 --> 00:14:54.071
just jump into the train or going by the car.

00:14:54.082 --> 00:14:55.998
If the car is available I’ll go by car

00:14:56.018 --> 00:14:57.112
or by train finished.

00:14:57.352 --> 00:14:58.686
What is there to think about?

00:15:00.168 --> 00:15:00.677
But no,

00:15:00.759 --> 00:15:03.763
then we must plan it out, “I’m programmed now I have to go”.

00:15:05.072 --> 00:15:07.716
You go to the station and find the train is not there

00:15:07.792 --> 00:15:10.165
because there was some accident so the train is not moving.

00:15:10.845 --> 00:15:13.637
So you are absolutely upset because

00:15:13.776 --> 00:15:15.697
you think that the train has gone now what to do.

00:15:16.472 --> 00:15:18.935
In that upsetting you do not even remember that

00:15:18.966 --> 00:15:20.797
you have a car and you have to go by the car.

00:15:21.865 --> 00:15:25.255
Now that whole things upsets you because you had plans

00:15:25.295 --> 00:15:28.325
to go by train and you had planned everything, now you

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:31.165
cannot reach there and what will happen?

00:15:31.571 --> 00:15:34.297
Now you are sitting here and worrying about it.

00:15:34.716 --> 00:15:37.102
As a person who is spontaneous what will you do?

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.088
All right depends on, I may go by train

00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:42.219
or by car whatever I feel like at that time.

00:15:43.057 --> 00:15:44.013
He is sitting tight.

00:15:44.682 --> 00:15:46.086
So he goes to the train,

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:49.248
sees if the train is there. If it is, nicely

00:15:49.456 --> 00:15:52.477
there’s a space available he gets into it.

00:15:52.766 --> 00:15:54.567
If the train is not available, all right,

00:15:54.604 --> 00:15:56.651
he comes home takes his car and goes away.

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:58.871
So now you have informed the people that

00:15:58.926 --> 00:16:00.345
you must meet at such and such a place.

00:16:00.376 --> 00:16:01.779
That’s also is there you see.

00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:04.253
So those people are running up down there

00:16:04.415 --> 00:16:05.963
and they will be there at the station.

00:16:07.041 --> 00:16:08.303
Now what’s the matter?

00:16:08.316 --> 00:16:10.634
Even if they’re at the station you can meet them at the station.

00:16:10.645 --> 00:16:12.716
You go by train and you can meet them.

00:16:12.912 --> 00:16:14.780
What is there to be that much upset about it?

00:16:15.367 --> 00:16:17.421
You see you can always contact them.

00:16:17.579 --> 00:16:20.824
But the way we get upset we have spoiled

00:16:20.855 --> 00:16:23.460
the complete program of going to Birmingham,

00:16:23.547 --> 00:16:27.098
which is a very beautiful program that we have got.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.781
We have to meet new people, we have to meet

00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:30.834
many people, we have to enjoy ourselves.

00:16:31.097 --> 00:16:32.365
That’s all finished

00:16:32.755 --> 00:16:35.314
because we had planned something and it

00:16:35.331 --> 00:16:36.806
did not work out, we are finished.

00:16:37.842 --> 00:16:41.981
All these things make us a miserable person.

00:16:42.696 --> 00:16:45.607
And we are so miserable and so grudging and

00:16:45.689 --> 00:16:48.803
so boring that those who are next to you just get fed up

00:16:48.848 --> 00:16:50.029
with it and they say,

00:16:50.061 --> 00:16:51.156
“Now shut up.

00:16:52.615 --> 00:16:54.726
If you are not going to Birmingham,

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.424
if you are not going don’t go. But don’t eat my head now”,

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:01.113
is a common experience of many.

00:17:01.857 --> 00:17:05.796
If this Mr. Ego he’s so, he doesn’t want you to be happy.

00:17:08.232 --> 00:17:10.295
He doesn’t want you to be relaxed.

00:17:10.498 --> 00:17:12.409
He all the time gives you ideas

00:17:12.436 --> 00:17:14.532
and tells you, “Do this and do that

00:17:14.567 --> 00:17:17.134
and you must get it done and this is to be done and You

00:17:17.151 --> 00:17:18.479
had better inform that person,

00:17:18.612 --> 00:17:19.808
be meticulous about it,”

00:17:20.084 --> 00:17:21.952
and it will go to such details

00:17:22.132 --> 00:17:24.227
that anything fails you are finished

00:17:24.584 --> 00:17:26.946
because your nerves are already finished and shattered.

00:17:27.225 --> 00:17:32.331
Anything, even a drop of inconvenience comes into you

00:17:32.433 --> 00:17:36.840
or even a feather of disturbance is there, you are finished.

00:17:36.997 --> 00:17:40.453
And so everybody is rattling, ”We have tensions. We have problems.”

00:17:40.506 --> 00:17:41.039
Why?

00:17:46.891 --> 00:17:50.888
What is the advantage of doing all these things?

00:17:50.948 --> 00:17:53.928
No advantage you know that. But then why do you do it?

00:17:53.975 --> 00:17:56.806
Because you have a big ego. It won’t allow you to rest.

00:17:57.856 --> 00:18:01.159
Whatever you may try it won’t. So what is the solution of that?

00:18:02.139 --> 00:18:05.339
Morning till evening ask for forgiveness from God.

00:18:05.514 --> 00:18:07.293
Pull your ears from both the sides

00:18:07.661 --> 00:18:09.132
and say, “Oh God, forgive me.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.114
Oh God, forgive me. And, oh God forgive me,”

00:18:12.214 --> 00:18:14.214
so this balloon of ego goes down a little.

00:18:16.155 --> 00:18:19.394
Remember Him morning, evening, every time.

00:18:20.398 --> 00:18:23.886
Remembering Christ brings down your ego very much.

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:27.321
He did everything that was possible

00:18:27.401 --> 00:18:29.601
that you should not develop your ego.

00:18:29.871 --> 00:18:31.587
Everything that was possible.

00:18:31.868 --> 00:18:34.694
He was born as an ordinary carpenter’s son.

00:18:36.111 --> 00:18:38.703
Lived in the most ordinary conditions.

00:18:40.678 --> 00:18:44.411
Kept Himself behind the whole scene.

00:18:44.605 --> 00:18:46.605
He could have been born as Roman Emperor.

00:18:49.052 --> 00:18:51.087
He could have been anybody there.

00:18:51.416 --> 00:18:53.753
But no He was born Himself.

00:18:54.021 --> 00:18:56.168
You know that He took his birth

00:18:56.412 --> 00:19:02.061
in a place where even ordinary people do not take their births.

00:19:03.062 --> 00:19:05.770
But, there also the light was there.

00:19:05.968 --> 00:19:08.901
Wherever He was born there was light and joy.

00:19:10.274 --> 00:19:12.484
And this is the thing we have to know, that

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:17.089
we have lost the joy because we have forgotten God Almighty.

00:19:18.171 --> 00:19:24.610
When we forget Him, that He is love and He is joy,

00:19:24.763 --> 00:19:26.763
naturally joy is also forgotten.

00:19:27.523 --> 00:19:30.238
And then we see people are not at all happy.

00:19:30.335 --> 00:19:33.056
They have affluence, they have money, they have everything,

00:19:33.274 --> 00:19:35.102
but still they are not happy.

00:19:35.151 --> 00:19:38.916
All the time they are in such a mess

00:19:39.095 --> 00:19:41.029
that you don’t know how to talk to them.

00:19:41.165 --> 00:19:43.165
If you say this word they’ll be angry.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:44.973
If you say that word they’ll be angry.

00:19:45.515 --> 00:19:48.015
They are not at all normal human beings.

00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:50.104
They are sick people.

00:19:50.171 --> 00:19:51.999
Sick with their ego.

00:19:53.076 --> 00:19:56.684
It’s a very simple thing is to ask for forgiveness.

00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:59.130
How many times do we do that?

00:19:59.793 --> 00:20:06.170
Not even once a day, not even once a month, not even once a year.

00:20:06.772 --> 00:20:09.651
Even on a Christmas day if we could say,

00:20:09.729 --> 00:20:13.681
“Forgive us Oh Lord for whatever we have done so far.”

00:20:13.799 --> 00:20:14.709
It will work out.

00:20:14.868 --> 00:20:19.255
But that day we must champagne to forgive Him more.

00:20:20.517 --> 00:20:22.184
So we must have gossips

00:20:22.421 --> 00:20:23.781
and we must have

00:20:23.957 --> 00:20:28.192
all the arrogant things by the time it is the end of Christmas.

00:20:32.869 --> 00:20:35.393
This ego, yellow side one,

00:20:35.562 --> 00:20:39.489
is the one that presses your superego too much. It does.

00:20:40.077 --> 00:20:44.675
It presses it so much sometimes that a person forgets

00:20:45.068 --> 00:20:48.026
that others are hurt by what they talk.

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:50.620
On the contrary they devise methods

00:20:50.713 --> 00:20:53.964
how to say things which are cutting,

00:20:55.514 --> 00:20:59.101
which are hurting, which are painful to others.

00:20:59.881 --> 00:21:03.191
They say such things, I mean all the time if you see.

00:21:03.203 --> 00:21:06.055
A person say from a village if he comes and sees

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:08.641
he’ll think, are they quarreling, what are they doing?

00:21:08.661 --> 00:21:10.103
I mean the whole discussion,

00:21:10.286 --> 00:21:12.673
even in the parliament I was surprised

00:21:12.877 --> 00:21:17.066
the way they talked to each other, no bull will

00:21:17.153 --> 00:21:19.902
treat another bull that way, see.

00:21:20.324 --> 00:21:24.346
Even a dog normally does not bark at another dog.

00:21:25.018 --> 00:21:30.015
No animal in the world all the time is barking at its fellow man.

00:21:30.057 --> 00:21:32.662
No animal in the whole world I can tell you this much.

00:21:32.952 --> 00:21:34.259
Only the human beings

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:37.104
if two people are there all the time they are going, ha ha ha ha

00:21:37.138 --> 00:21:40.380
all the time that way. How is it possible?

00:21:40.513 --> 00:21:45.228
His ego and her ego or maybe both his ego

00:21:45.338 --> 00:21:47.011
are dashing at each other.

00:21:47.161 --> 00:21:52.829
And there is a kind of a funny type

00:21:52.917 --> 00:21:56.751
of feeling that oh I have mastered the thing,

00:21:57.297 --> 00:21:59.297
I have got the thing, I have got the point.

00:21:59.352 --> 00:22:01.000
I have proved the point.

00:22:01.248 --> 00:22:05.270
But in that I have lost everything that was so beautiful

00:22:05.364 --> 00:22:08.004
and so much joy giving within me.

00:22:08.225 --> 00:22:11.084
Actually a sensible person would recede

00:22:11.202 --> 00:22:14.455
from the place where two people are having an argument.

00:22:14.992 --> 00:22:18.980
Argument is a sign of tomfoolery.

00:22:20.089 --> 00:22:24.575
I haven’t seen any argument coming to any end whatsoever.

00:22:24.799 --> 00:22:26.572
If it is then it is all right.

00:22:26.605 --> 00:22:28.232
But it never does come.

00:22:28.485 --> 00:22:33.391
Because, if say, you ask Me questions I answer you, all right.

00:22:33.761 --> 00:22:36.029
If you do not like the answer give it up.

00:22:36.575 --> 00:22:39.652
But if you argue with Me still and I argue with you

00:22:39.794 --> 00:22:40.819
where will you end?

00:22:41.517 --> 00:22:44.987
Argument is not going to lead you to any knowledge

00:22:45.533 --> 00:22:49.789
but a very terrible ego developing into you.

00:22:50.858 --> 00:22:55.372
The whole modern concept is ego oriented.

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:59.394
All western countries are ego orientated.

00:22:59.775 --> 00:23:02.086
They want to develop your ego and pamper it.

00:23:02.116 --> 00:23:04.292
There are so many other ways by which they do.

00:23:04.601 --> 00:23:06.925
Why I’m talking more about it because we are all

00:23:06.992 --> 00:23:09.835
supposed to be western people and affluent people you see.

00:23:09.845 --> 00:23:12.403
Supposed to be very wise and leading

00:23:12.464 --> 00:23:15.156
or misleading, I don’t know, the developing countries.

00:23:15.292 --> 00:23:18.140
So we have to understand ourselves where are we

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:21.108
as far as our understanding of things are concerned.

00:23:21.426 --> 00:23:26.646
How ego is pampered within us is by a large-scale method.

00:23:27.826 --> 00:23:31.288
They work on your ego throughout to have all these

00:23:31.323 --> 00:23:33.183
so-called enterprises.

00:23:33.368 --> 00:23:35.126
For example to a woman they’ll say,

00:23:35.238 --> 00:23:37.736
“Oh you must have a waist like this and you must

00:23:37.747 --> 00:23:39.466
have a face like this and you must have –“

00:23:39.502 --> 00:23:42.779
For a man, “You must this kind of a body.

00:23:42.793 --> 00:23:45.411
You should be Mr. Universe or you should be something,”

00:23:45.561 --> 00:23:47.654
so the man starts working on it immediately.

00:23:48.223 --> 00:23:49.906
You must, there so many people I have seen

00:23:49.916 --> 00:23:52.338
running on the roads in this cold, I don’t understand.

00:23:52.602 --> 00:23:53.916
Like mad you know and some of

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.135
them are Member of Parliament.

00:23:55.143 --> 00:23:56.734
The whole night they keep awake and the whole day

00:23:56.769 --> 00:23:57.714
they are running about.

00:23:57.799 --> 00:23:59.482
I say what are you doing?

00:23:59.636 --> 00:24:01.097
What is the need to do this?

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.448
To keep good health you must do it.

00:24:03.961 --> 00:24:06.222
To keep good health don’t work like mad,

00:24:06.583 --> 00:24:09.559
be a sensible and a wise person.

00:24:10.845 --> 00:24:13.765
Wisdom is to be sought to keep good health,

00:24:13.908 --> 00:24:18.391
to be all right and not this kind of mad ego orientated things.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:23.917
So then the one way is to excite your ego about your physique.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.356
Then there is ego about, you must have a big car.

00:24:28.243 --> 00:24:30.865
You see people try to show off their possessions.

00:24:31.002 --> 00:24:32.093
You have a big car,

00:24:32.186 --> 00:24:35.349
then they’re going about. I mean they really look to me like jokers,

00:24:35.379 --> 00:24:36.321
that’s all they are.

00:24:36.934 --> 00:24:39.189
I mean car I can understand is a convenience

00:24:39.241 --> 00:24:42.132
and a good quality car if somebody can afford it should have it

00:24:42.138 --> 00:24:45.053
because it is a headache to have a bad car. So it’s all right.

00:24:45.636 --> 00:24:48.222
But by having a car you become something great.

00:24:48.337 --> 00:24:49.741
You may not have food in the house

00:24:49.777 --> 00:24:52.240
but you must have a very good car to go about.

00:24:52.368 --> 00:24:54.131
And all these ideas come.

00:24:54.209 --> 00:24:56.293
Then they will advertise, you see, this will

00:24:56.366 --> 00:24:58.366
be a very good car for you.

00:24:58.547 --> 00:24:59.555
What is it for you?

00:24:59.563 --> 00:25:02.244
It is nothing but to pamper your ego.

00:25:02.437 --> 00:25:04.464
All these advertisements are nothing

00:25:04.547 --> 00:25:06.821
but by which your ego is pampered.

00:25:07.058 --> 00:25:08.651
All these things they’re treated.

00:25:08.715 --> 00:25:11.605
Now in America if you go every handle has to be different.

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:12.875
Everything has to be different.

00:25:12.928 --> 00:25:15.127
Why so much difference in everything?

00:25:15.196 --> 00:25:17.961
Why do you want to have everything so different?

00:25:18.837 --> 00:25:21.190
Is it some aesthetics, you think in that?

00:25:21.692 --> 00:25:25.925
It is none of the aesthetics but is just to pamper your ego.

00:25:25.941 --> 00:25:28.176
Even the so-called art connoisseurs

00:25:28.269 --> 00:25:30.801
are nothing but ego pamperers.

00:25:30.993 --> 00:25:33.281
Your stamp collections this, that,

00:25:33.354 --> 00:25:35.695
all this is nothing but ego pampering.

00:25:35.724 --> 00:25:38.615
And what a waste of time, you just think about it.

00:25:40.423 --> 00:25:43.500
This ego thing comes into us

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:48.384
because we are first of all, as I said, that in the west

00:25:48.617 --> 00:25:50.433
the living was very difficult.

00:25:50.458 --> 00:25:51.764
They had to fight the nature.

00:25:51.905 --> 00:25:53.905
And when you have to fight the nature

00:25:53.928 --> 00:25:55.866
you have to develop your ego to fight it.

00:25:56.196 --> 00:25:58.594
Or actually when you are fighting the nature

00:25:58.693 --> 00:25:59.838
the ego develops within you.

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.529
And then once that momentum has started in you

00:26:03.645 --> 00:26:06.014
it is very difficult to bring it down.

00:26:06.234 --> 00:26:10.127
It is such a terrible disease that

00:26:10.469 --> 00:26:14.249
people have taken it for granted that that’s a part of their lives.

00:26:14.611 --> 00:26:17.553
You are not your ego. You are not.

00:26:18.463 --> 00:26:21.597
When I say that you must surrender yourself to God

00:26:21.678 --> 00:26:23.678
they think Mother why should we surrender?

00:26:24.075 --> 00:26:27.297
Yourself means that ego with which you are identified.

00:26:27.336 --> 00:26:31.352
I don’t say that you surrender your wisdom.

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:35.372
Or I can say surrender your ego to your wisdom.

00:26:37.086 --> 00:26:39.376
But it is so difficult to give it up because

00:26:39.403 --> 00:26:42.046
we have learned to live with it, identified with it.

00:26:42.173 --> 00:26:46.667
We just cannot think of life without our ego, we just cannot.

00:26:47.905 --> 00:26:52.183
And it has gone to such an extent that we don’t even realize

00:26:52.336 --> 00:26:55.608
how far we have gone in cruelty.

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:59.507
Like, “I like this kind, I like that kind.”

00:26:59.537 --> 00:27:01.790
You go to somebody’s house and you say like this.

00:27:01.859 --> 00:27:04.482
Is indecent to talk like that.

00:27:06.821 --> 00:27:11.165
It is vulgar to express, “I like.” Who are you?

00:27:11.776 --> 00:27:12.558
Are you God?

00:27:14.382 --> 00:27:16.618
I want this. I want that.

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:20.258
I am very particular about this. I’m very, who are you?

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:25.012
Just ask yourself a question, “Who am I?

00:27:26.642 --> 00:27:28.642
I’m the Spirit.

00:27:28.799 --> 00:27:31.049
I’m that eternal being.

00:27:31.619 --> 00:27:33.619
Have I become that?”

00:27:35.294 --> 00:27:39.716
On the contrary we are hurting everybody’s Spirit by our ego.

00:27:40.436 --> 00:27:44.861
Every moment when we talk to others we are hurting them.

00:27:45.125 --> 00:27:47.918
Actually people have lost faith in God,

00:27:48.703 --> 00:27:52.269
because those who are in charge of God are so arrogant

00:27:52.851 --> 00:27:55.595
and so egoistical

00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:59.894
that it has become impossible for anybody to think of God,

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.040
which is beyond your ego.

00:28:03.157 --> 00:28:08.089
You’ll be surprised, ego is absolutely superficial like a bubble.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.127
It is just like a balloon,

00:28:10.217 --> 00:28:12.198
which can burst just like that.

00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:14.247
And it should go.

00:28:14.912 --> 00:28:18.140
It should go so that you should rise.

00:28:18.517 --> 00:28:24.616
It should disappear so that your attention rises in your Spirit.

00:28:24.963 --> 00:28:28.248
And that you see the whole world as a part

00:28:28.576 --> 00:28:31.131
of that Spirit that you are.

00:28:31.929 --> 00:28:34.613
This is the boundary, which you have to cross

00:28:34.707 --> 00:28:37.464
and for that we have to take help from Christ.

00:28:38.446 --> 00:28:41.939
Christ crucified himself. Why?

00:28:42.611 --> 00:28:43.757
Because what did He do?

00:28:45.679 --> 00:28:46.902
Did He loot people?

00:28:47.133 --> 00:28:50.862
Today you have thousands of these thugs coming here and looting you.

00:28:51.751 --> 00:28:54.428
Nobody crucifies them. What did He do?

00:28:56.191 --> 00:28:59.881
He just challenged the ego of these Romans

00:29:00.503 --> 00:29:05.103
and of these Jews, those who were angry with Him,

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:08.159
and that’s why He was crucified.

00:29:10.849 --> 00:29:14.713
And we have to crucify our ego now through His cross.

00:29:16.525 --> 00:29:18.952
Otherwise we are going to do the same

00:29:19.612 --> 00:29:24.790
again to ourselves that in our own being

00:29:24.894 --> 00:29:28.324
we crucify our Christ by our ego.

00:29:28.808 --> 00:29:31.268
It is a very symbolic gesture of Christ,

00:29:32.109 --> 00:29:35.411
His birth in the most humble place,

00:29:35.765 --> 00:29:37.167
in a very humble place.

00:29:37.577 --> 00:29:41.091
He is born in the optic thalamus, you can say,

00:29:41.201 --> 00:29:44.635
is the place where there brain, all activities coming and

00:29:44.684 --> 00:29:49.616
all the, all sorts of problems there chasing you,

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:54.901
and there He lives and you have to just awaken Him there

00:29:54.984 --> 00:29:59.140
so that your ego is crucified once for all.

00:30:00.367 --> 00:30:03.020
But I don’t think you fight your ego

00:30:03.203 --> 00:30:05.368
because it is not that important to fight.

00:30:05.458 --> 00:30:07.146
You are fighting with your shadow.

00:30:07.678 --> 00:30:10.310
You have shadow which is called as ego

00:30:10.848 --> 00:30:13.752
which is not to be fought and wasted you,

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:16.604
to waste your energy on him. Just no need to fight,

00:30:16.874 --> 00:30:20.072
only thing if you stand in the center of the light

00:30:20.134 --> 00:30:21.396
you don’t see any shadow.

00:30:21.512 --> 00:30:23.104
It is so simple as that.

00:30:23.169 --> 00:30:26.784
If you stand in the center of light that is Christ

00:30:26.848 --> 00:30:29.014
you don’t see any shadow anywhere.

00:30:29.065 --> 00:30:32.193
But when I say this I may sound like other people who give sermons,

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:36.379
“Stand in the shadow of Christ or stand in the light of Christ.”

00:30:36.449 --> 00:30:37.352
Now what does that mean?

00:30:38.698 --> 00:30:43.344
Where is that light or where is that place where you should stand?

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:47.913
That place is here in the center of your

00:30:49.847 --> 00:30:53.497
optic thalamus where there is no thought.

00:30:54.304 --> 00:30:56.986
You have to stand in thoughtless awareness.

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:00.888
Many people who have had a problem with Agnya,

00:31:01.252 --> 00:31:03.017
many people who have come

00:31:03.044 --> 00:31:04.894
[Talk is interrupted here and a few words are missing]

00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:07.510
…thoughts will stop and they will be beyond thought.

00:31:07.843 --> 00:31:11.587
And this a very, very important Chakra

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:15.448
for Sahaja Yogis because when the Kundalini rises above,

00:31:16.348 --> 00:31:19.856
above the Agnya Chakra immediately there is no thought.

00:31:20.016 --> 00:31:24.575
You do not get any thoughts from ego or superego.

00:31:24.644 --> 00:31:30.452
But there is wobbling in the Agnya because of your imbalanced ways.

00:31:30.584 --> 00:31:32.075
And the imbalanced ways are,

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.069
that sometimes you are with ego or with superego.

00:31:36.543 --> 00:31:39.239
This has happened to our people in the West

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:43.280
because we have had so much of ego we got really tired of it.

00:31:44.174 --> 00:31:45.383
We got frightened with it.

00:31:45.759 --> 00:31:50.596
Then we started taking to drugs and things to increase our superego.

00:31:51.353 --> 00:31:53.067
But by doing that what we are doing is

00:31:53.132 --> 00:31:55.555
pushing by one end and bringing back another end

00:31:55.624 --> 00:31:57.285
and that’s how we are wobbling

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.527
our ego and superego

00:31:59.724 --> 00:32:02.391
by which we are not helping ourselves at all.

00:32:02.986 --> 00:32:04.986
So what one has to do

00:32:05.106 --> 00:32:08.177
is to rise within oneself up to the point of Agnya

00:32:08.274 --> 00:32:10.292
and try to steady your Agnya.

00:32:10.841 --> 00:32:13.383
There are many people have asked Me one question.

00:32:13.401 --> 00:32:15.099
How to steady the Agnya?

00:32:17.129 --> 00:32:22.651
Agnya is placed at the crossing point of our nerves

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.316
and also optic thalamus.

00:32:24.714 --> 00:32:27.485
Now, so it is said that

00:32:27.566 --> 00:32:30.492
if you have wobbling eyes you’ll have a wobbling Agnya.

00:32:31.276 --> 00:32:32.806
You have to steady your eyes.

00:32:33.629 --> 00:32:34.701
You have to soothe them.

00:32:34.921 --> 00:32:40.773
Now it is very, very out of date, ancient, old

00:32:40.865 --> 00:32:44.264
and all sorts of names that you call it to a thing like that.

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.537
But you must steady your eyes and

00:32:46.629 --> 00:32:50.684
steady them in such a way that it is very soothing for the eyes.

00:32:51.212 --> 00:32:54.876
Which is the most soothing thing for the eyes is the green grass.

00:32:56.956 --> 00:33:01.378
If you could see the green grass with your eyes means you walk

00:33:02.366 --> 00:33:04.354
with your eyes on the ground.

00:33:05.416 --> 00:33:08.189
Your eyes will be soothed, your Agnya will be all right.

00:33:08.364 --> 00:33:10.203
That’s why Christ said that,

00:33:10.231 --> 00:33:13.504
“I tell you about the adulterous eyes”.

00:33:13.732 --> 00:33:15.801
He talked about adulterous eyes.

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:18.803
The eyes with which you do adultery.

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:22.032
Is a very common thing these days.

00:33:22.132 --> 00:33:23.933
Every woman a man must see.

00:33:23.991 --> 00:33:25.405
Every man a woman must see.

00:33:26.342 --> 00:33:28.409
As if it is the most important job.

00:33:28.446 --> 00:33:30.641
If you have not seen one woman you’re finished.

00:33:31.707 --> 00:33:33.108
I mean this is being modern.

00:33:33.437 --> 00:33:35.356
But I am an old fashioned lady.

00:33:35.706 --> 00:33:38.760
And at the time of Christ he said,

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:40.868
“You should not have adulterous eyes.”

00:33:41.181 --> 00:33:43.787
And the ones who have adulterous eyes are,

00:33:44.568 --> 00:33:49.751
no more than any other, but our Western Christians.

00:33:51.135 --> 00:33:54.249
Who all the time even in the church, even

00:33:54.309 --> 00:33:57.444
when they’re giving sermons, their eyes are moving with adultery.

00:33:58.437 --> 00:34:03.644
These eyes have to be very, very pure, very, very deep

00:34:03.756 --> 00:34:08.559
and very loving when you want to have your Agnya all right.

00:34:08.672 --> 00:34:10.403
Because you receive through you eyes.

00:34:11.316 --> 00:34:12.916
Say if you have closed your eyes

00:34:13.055 --> 00:34:15.072
you do not put your attention to anything because

00:34:15.086 --> 00:34:16.032
your eyes are closed.

00:34:16.175 --> 00:34:18.583
You are not adding more thoughts to yourself.

00:34:18.872 --> 00:34:22.045
But if your eyes are open you are adding much more thoughts

00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:24.630
because everywhere the eyes go the attention goes

00:34:24.664 --> 00:34:27.521
and you see things and create thoughts and put in them.

00:34:27.597 --> 00:34:32.267
So your attention which has to go to the Spirit,

00:34:32.453 --> 00:34:34.103
which has to go to God,

00:34:34.401 --> 00:34:38.302
which has to shine through the window of Divine.

00:34:38.569 --> 00:34:41.958
This beautiful thing is ruined by

00:34:42.307 --> 00:34:46.082
the way we use our eyes and we do not respect it.

00:34:47.682 --> 00:34:54.682
There’s nothing so pure and beautiful as the grass on the ground

00:34:54.908 --> 00:34:57.987
or the ground itself, which takes our feet,

00:34:58.075 --> 00:35:02.178
which supports us, which looks after us, enriches us.

00:35:03.562 --> 00:35:05.937
We should put our eyes on the Mother Earth

00:35:06.035 --> 00:35:07.915
instead of looking at every person.

00:35:08.484 --> 00:35:11.437
But from Sahaja Yoga point of view now many of you know

00:35:11.441 --> 00:35:13.911
what happens to your eyes  when you look at somebody.

00:35:14.237 --> 00:35:18.270
Maybe a entity might enter your eyes.

00:35:18.689 --> 00:35:20.488
And it is, you’ll be amazed

00:35:20.849 --> 00:35:23.137
that it is the play of the entity

00:35:23.186 --> 00:35:25.390
what we call this so-called flirting is.

00:35:25.507 --> 00:35:28.603
I’ve talked about it before also and people didn’t like it

00:35:28.745 --> 00:35:30.213
when I told them about it.

00:35:30.888 --> 00:35:34.497
But I have seen actual entities entering from eyes to eyes.

00:35:36.164 --> 00:35:38.884
I have seen very simple people who come down

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:41.272
to such places, say in a party.

00:35:41.784 --> 00:35:46.141
In a party people are just exchanging entities

00:35:46.211 --> 00:35:47.373
from one eye to another.

00:35:47.645 --> 00:35:49.162
Once it goes to another person

00:35:49.235 --> 00:35:51.010
he puts his entity into another person.

00:35:51.155 --> 00:35:52.758
And that third goes into another person.

00:35:53.045 --> 00:35:55.800
All the time your attention is diverted.

00:35:55.871 --> 00:35:58.806
And you feel it is attracted towards something,

00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:01.537
you do not know why it is attracted.

00:36:02.095 --> 00:36:04.433
Now the certain symbols are also made like that.

00:36:05.276 --> 00:36:06.847
To add up to the problems,

00:36:07.122 --> 00:36:09.872
you see all the society is working at it.

00:36:09.914 --> 00:36:11.543
That you should appear in such a way that

00:36:11.549 --> 00:36:12.757
every man should look at you.

00:36:15.608 --> 00:36:17.013
Every woman should look at you.

00:36:17.876 --> 00:36:19.575
Why? What is the use?

00:36:19.796 --> 00:36:21.931
Supposing I look at you what do I get?

00:36:23.198 --> 00:36:25.456
What do I get by looking at a person?

00:36:27.479 --> 00:36:30.247
What is the advantage just looking at a person?

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:33.046
We are wasting such a lot of energy for what?

00:36:34.794 --> 00:36:37.164
In the same way if you are walking on the roads,

00:36:38.162 --> 00:36:41.589
we are seeing some beautiful things all right.

00:36:41.841 --> 00:36:43.579
If you have to buy something, all right go ahead,

00:36:43.608 --> 00:36:45.863
see those things, whatever you have to select is all right.

00:36:46.187 --> 00:36:50.005
But all the time just because your eyes are such,

00:36:50.029 --> 00:36:52.982
you are just doing it and you do not know the reason

00:36:53.197 --> 00:36:54.914
why you are doing like this,

00:36:54.954 --> 00:36:56.954
all the time why your eyes are wobbling.

00:36:58.926 --> 00:37:02.462
And that is a sure and certain sign for a person to become mad.

00:37:05.214 --> 00:37:08.420
Absolutely, that’s a sure and certain sign is,

00:37:08.474 --> 00:37:11.086
when a person is mad

00:37:11.444 --> 00:37:13.709
how do you make it out that a person is lunatic.

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:18.809
If you see his eyes the iris in the eyes are all the time wobbling.

00:37:19.686 --> 00:37:21.267
They cannot keep it steady.

00:37:21.466 --> 00:37:24.634
Or they are sick they’re also, you can see,

00:37:24.841 --> 00:37:28.372
that these eyes are all the time wobbling.

00:37:28.401 --> 00:37:29.329
There is no steadiness.

00:37:29.944 --> 00:37:32.532
Not only this but you have seen those people who

00:37:32.559 --> 00:37:35.182
have come in the Sahaja Yoga when they close their eyes

00:37:35.339 --> 00:37:38.987
they find their eyes are flickering.

00:37:39.043 --> 00:37:40.501
Their eyelids are flickering.

00:37:40.661 --> 00:37:42.951
That means there is some sort of a disturbance

00:37:43.031 --> 00:37:44.338
in the Kundalini rising.

00:37:47.309 --> 00:37:51.072
Whole tension if you call it as hundred

00:37:51.246 --> 00:37:55.193
then at least eighty percent of it comes through our eyes.

00:37:57.897 --> 00:38:00.972
Then how important it is to protect our eyes

00:38:01.214 --> 00:38:04.508
from all kind of useless activities we are doing.

00:38:06.806 --> 00:38:13.806
Christ - Christ’s life shows so many aspects

00:38:14.146 --> 00:38:16.761
of how to respect others.

00:38:16.885 --> 00:38:20.661
But one of them which has been very much misused throughout is

00:38:20.718 --> 00:38:22.718
that of the prostitute.

00:38:24.837 --> 00:38:29.712
He saved the prostitute, He saved her no doubt.

00:38:30.122 --> 00:38:33.239
But you spoil these prostitutes.

00:38:34.841 --> 00:38:37.942
A good woman you make her into prostitutes.

00:38:38.379 --> 00:38:41.798
You give her ideas by which she becomes a prostitute.

00:38:42.107 --> 00:38:43.385
A good Huswife (old English word like housewife)

00:38:43.814 --> 00:38:47.226
is turned into a prostitute by an egotistical man.

00:38:47.887 --> 00:38:53.684
Young small girls who are virgins are being destroyed

00:38:54.004 --> 00:38:56.470
by your dirty glances.

00:38:56.655 --> 00:38:58.436
Do you realize this?

00:38:58.682 --> 00:39:01.711
That you are doing just the opposite what Christ had done?

00:39:01.827 --> 00:39:03.420
And you say that He saved, Christ,

00:39:03.628 --> 00:39:06.347
so even if we are prostitutes He’ll save us.

00:39:06.372 --> 00:39:07.809
But why be prostitutes?

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:13.178
This is such a stupid style of thinking.

00:39:13.375 --> 00:39:16.039
That we should become prostitutes so that Christ will save us.

00:39:21.775 --> 00:39:25.821
One has to think about all these things

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:28.712
in the proper light of Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:29.063 --> 00:39:30.605
Unless and until you are realized

00:39:30.739 --> 00:39:33.047
My talk is just useless for you.

00:39:33.781 --> 00:39:36.137
But once you are realized you will know

00:39:36.359 --> 00:39:38.555
that if you glance at someone

00:39:38.798 --> 00:39:41.422
you might suddenly get a headache at the back.

00:39:41.527 --> 00:39:44.534
You might feel a dart has gone into your head

00:39:44.552 --> 00:39:45.892
or something has happened.

00:39:45.992 --> 00:39:47.724
You might feel that you’re blinding

00:39:48.053 --> 00:39:53.024
with somebody’s face and you will get all kinds of experiences

00:39:53.054 --> 00:39:56.711
by which you will know how important are your eyes.

00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:01.405
All your nervousness and everything can be cured

00:40:01.699 --> 00:40:03.254
if you have pure eyes.

00:40:03.504 --> 00:40:05.039
But it is such a vicious circle

00:40:05.381 --> 00:40:07.645
that through your eyes you gather all the bad

00:40:07.734 --> 00:40:10.807
and is accumulated in the Agnya and you have to clear the Agnya

00:40:10.845 --> 00:40:12.296
to make the eyes clear.

00:40:13.143 --> 00:40:14.246
It’s a vicious circle.

00:40:14.733 --> 00:40:16.733
But it can start at a point as I said,

00:40:16.828 --> 00:40:18.302
we have to ask for forgiveness.

00:40:20.107 --> 00:40:27.079
Secondly we have to bring Christ in our Agnya Chakra.

00:40:29.482 --> 00:40:31.314
Thirdly we have to give up all

00:40:31.643 --> 00:40:35.724
drugs and all intoxicants and all smoking.

00:40:36.306 --> 00:40:39.576
That happens automatically when you are a Sahaja Yogi,

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:40.454
it will work out.

00:40:40.753 --> 00:40:45.800
But eyes express the whole of your being, your brain,

00:40:46.072 --> 00:40:50.483
your body, your limbs everything.

00:40:50.616 --> 00:40:56.120
And if your Agnya is all right then you eyes

00:40:56.578 --> 00:40:58.220
are perfectly all right.

00:40:58.414 --> 00:41:00.797
They emit nothing but love

00:41:01.395 --> 00:41:02.830
wherever they glance.

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:06.977
Only with a glance of your eyes you can raise the Kundalini.

00:41:08.091 --> 00:41:12.371
Only with the glance of your eyes you can cure people.

00:41:12.845 --> 00:41:16.659
Only with your glance you can bring joy into

00:41:16.702 --> 00:41:19.090
the destroyed and the ruined people.

00:41:19.524 --> 00:41:23.064
So these eyes which you see are the windows

00:41:23.081 --> 00:41:25.377
of your being, of your heart.

00:41:25.597 --> 00:41:30.122
When the Spirit is expressed through your eyes,

00:41:30.316 --> 00:41:32.214
you must have noticed yourself,

00:41:32.285 --> 00:41:36.212
that when the Kundalini rises then the eyes become dilated.

00:41:37.697 --> 00:41:39.697
And a realized soul has got

00:41:39.939 --> 00:41:46.550
black eyes because they have these eyes are dilated.

00:41:46.688 --> 00:41:49.852
At least when I see them they are all dilated black eyes.

00:41:50.604 --> 00:41:51.730
Apart from that

00:41:51.927 --> 00:41:55.520
a realized soul can be made out by his eyes which are sparkling.

00:41:55.918 --> 00:41:57.918
There’s a sparkle like diamonds.

00:41:58.142 --> 00:42:00.287
They sparkle all the time and

00:42:00.392 --> 00:42:01.792
you can make out from the eyes

00:42:01.827 --> 00:42:03.827
that this person is a realized soul.

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:07.305
There’s a tremendous difference between a non-realized

00:42:07.457 --> 00:42:10.021
soul’s eyes and a realized soul’s eyes.

00:42:10.249 --> 00:42:15.658
So you can imagine how your Spirit sees through your eyes.

00:42:15.861 --> 00:42:19.672
But if the eyes are not pure it doesn’t stay there long.

00:42:20.039 --> 00:42:22.859
So if we have to understand Christ

00:42:22.897 --> 00:42:25.107
physically we have to respect our eyes.

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:31.420
Mentally we have to give up all that is impure in our mind.

00:42:32.369 --> 00:42:35.734
Now, so we come to the impurities of the mind.

00:42:35.958 --> 00:42:38.539
And the impurities of mind are,

00:42:40.145 --> 00:42:42.483
there are so many poisons, you know, about.

00:42:42.677 --> 00:42:45.236
I mean there are books and books written about the poisons.

00:42:45.328 --> 00:42:48.501
And the psychologists are supposed to take out all your poisons.

00:42:48.715 --> 00:42:50.446
I don’t know if they can do it at all.

00:42:50.615 --> 00:42:51.983
But they have the worst Agnya.

00:42:52.205 --> 00:42:55.171
All these psychologists have the worst Agnya

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:57.513
and I don’t think they are capable

00:42:57.609 --> 00:43:00.262
of really giving any relief to people

00:43:00.359 --> 00:43:02.598
who are suffering mentally.

00:43:03.084 --> 00:43:05.084
Mental sufferings are of two types.

00:43:05.855 --> 00:43:08.473
Say the same thing is that one is…

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:15.900
MOTHER SAYS ASIDE: Vibrations are so much, I can’t stand it.

00:43:16.538 --> 00:43:23.370
One type of mental troubles are

00:43:23.489 --> 00:43:26.417
where people oppress you very much.

00:43:26.574 --> 00:43:30.370
You see you go on bearing the cross.

00:43:31.311 --> 00:43:35.129
Now this is a very wrong idea people have about Christ.

00:43:35.977 --> 00:43:39.534
Bearing the cross doesn’t mean that anybody who tries

00:43:39.726 --> 00:43:44.193
to oppress you should go on taking the enslavement upon yourself.

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:48.954
You’re not to enslave to anyone whatsoever.

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:52.455
Anybody who tries

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:56.765
to make a slave out of you, you should deny it absolutely.

00:43:57.087 --> 00:43:59.087
You should say Ham, I am.

00:43:59.506 --> 00:44:01.180
Who are you to dominate me?

00:44:01.491 --> 00:44:02.322
Anyone

00:44:02.418 --> 00:44:05.758
whether you are of a black skin, or a red skin or a yellow skin,

00:44:05.838 --> 00:44:11.310
nobody has right to dominate anyone in this whole world.

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:15.084
And if anybody is doing it, “Oh what to do now,

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:17.520
after all you see we are poor people,

00:44:17.604 --> 00:44:20.579
or we are like this or he’s supporting,” and all that.

00:44:21.012 --> 00:44:25.292
Then they are running away from their duty towards themselves.

00:44:25.938 --> 00:44:27.770
Such people cannot get Realization.

00:44:28.879 --> 00:44:31.517
Slaves are not going to become kings.

00:44:34.041 --> 00:44:40.139
So the slavery that is supposed to be confused with bearing the cross

00:44:40.546 --> 00:44:44.467
is another confusion of modern times.

00:44:46.556 --> 00:44:48.760
We have to rise in our self-respect.

00:44:49.216 --> 00:44:50.650
And we have to understand

00:44:50.770 --> 00:44:55.050
that no one in this world has a right to dominate us.

00:44:56.176 --> 00:44:59.506
But then what is bearing of the cross is?

00:45:00.389 --> 00:45:04.319
First of all the people of His level never suffer.

00:45:04.892 --> 00:45:06.259
It’s just a joke going on.

00:45:06.294 --> 00:45:08.667
It’s a Leela, it’s a play going on for them.

00:45:08.906 --> 00:45:10.346
They never suffer,

00:45:13.875 --> 00:45:18.087
and even if they so called act as suffering

00:45:19.965 --> 00:45:22.472
they just do it because they want to do it.

00:45:23.754 --> 00:45:25.754
They are not helpless people.

00:45:26.887 --> 00:45:28.203
They are not slaves.

00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:34.025
And those who think that by bearing it up and by suffering it

00:45:35.303 --> 00:45:36.840
we are becoming Christians

00:45:36.979 --> 00:45:39.152
they should know they are psychological cases.

00:45:41.948 --> 00:45:45.253
And if they are crying and weeping and all the time saying,

00:45:45.355 --> 00:45:50.109
“What to do, you see I am in love and my lover tortures me.”

00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:53.536
You are neither in love neither you have a lover.

00:45:54.261 --> 00:45:56.900
It is a kind of a psychological clubbing.

00:45:57.104 --> 00:45:58.895
That he is a dominating man

00:45:58.951 --> 00:46:01.424
and you like his domination, that’s why you are together.

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:02.909
Is a simple fact.

00:46:06.154 --> 00:46:13.152
So every human being has his own self-respect.

00:46:13.415 --> 00:46:17.994
And he must respect his self that is the Spirit within him.

00:46:18.035 --> 00:46:19.252
And nothing should dominate it.

00:46:19.354 --> 00:46:20.332
Whether you belong to this country or that country,

00:46:20.519 --> 00:46:21.198
or this ism or that ism. All this will break down.

00:46:21.226 --> 00:46:23.099
Under the rule of God

00:46:23.888 --> 00:46:27.105
nobody has the right to dominate anybody’s Spirit.

00:46:30.657 --> 00:46:32.507
But when you are given freedom

00:46:32.543 --> 00:46:35.227
you go to the other side that is Mr. Ego.

00:46:36.761 --> 00:46:38.991
You do not know how to use your freedom.

00:46:40.423 --> 00:46:42.423
So you try to dominate others.

00:46:44.006 --> 00:46:46.952
Your freedom is, everybody’s freedom is in danger.

00:46:47.317 --> 00:46:50.919
You’re on top of everyone, and torturing everybody’s souls.

00:46:50.977 --> 00:46:53.934
And you are dominating by land

00:46:54.073 --> 00:46:59.240
and by properties or by possessions.

00:47:03.903 --> 00:47:06.314
So either this way or that way,

00:47:06.728 --> 00:47:10.768
mentally if you are of this category or that category,

00:47:11.453 --> 00:47:13.167
you are against yourself.

00:47:15.048 --> 00:47:17.958
Just be in the center and see for yourself.

00:47:19.309 --> 00:47:21.566
Just be looking at it.

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:26.906
Are you emitting love towards another person?

00:47:27.126 --> 00:47:31.632
If you are a slave how can you love? You cannot.

00:47:34.683 --> 00:47:42.727
If you are free and abandoned how can you love?

00:47:44.759 --> 00:47:49.353
Love has its own bondages very sweet and beautiful.

00:47:50.149 --> 00:47:52.149
You have to live with them.

00:47:53.946 --> 00:47:55.450
You enjoy those bondages.

00:47:56.251 --> 00:47:58.339
For a little child will come to your house

00:47:58.359 --> 00:48:01.707
and he will spoil your house no doubt, and that he should do.

00:48:03.081 --> 00:48:05.137
And you should enjoy that spoiling.

00:48:07.638 --> 00:48:11.721
Then your freedom if it is challenged by a little child’s crying,

00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:14.213
then you are not wise people.

00:48:15.507 --> 00:48:16.971
This is abandonment.

00:48:18.782 --> 00:48:21.001
Or I would say it is loneliness.

00:48:21.069 --> 00:48:27.145
It is cutting off from the primordial, from the big one,

00:48:28.148 --> 00:48:30.144
from the large one that you are.

00:48:31.128 --> 00:48:36.634
Is not to be able to tolerate the freedom of others.

00:48:36.761 --> 00:48:39.108
A child has no freedom to cry in the house.

00:48:40.339 --> 00:48:43.769
What sort of freedom you conceive of.

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:47.084
A mother has no right to say

00:48:47.115 --> 00:48:49.042
something she wants to say about her child,

00:48:49.062 --> 00:48:51.539
which is her duty to tell him what is right and wrong.

00:48:52.455 --> 00:48:54.308
If the son does not have right

00:48:54.462 --> 00:48:57.147
to eat whatever he likes in his own mother’s family

00:48:57.404 --> 00:48:59.285
then what sort of freedom do you have?

00:48:59.293 --> 00:49:01.178
It’s such a confusion of things.

00:49:04.261 --> 00:49:06.094
So this kind of freedom

00:49:06.605 --> 00:49:10.100
is just the opposite and extreme of enslavement.

00:49:10.323 --> 00:49:14.500
But in the center is love where you are bound by everyone.

00:49:15.027 --> 00:49:18.419
I am bound by My children. Yes, I am.

00:49:19.045 --> 00:49:20.033
I am proud of them.

00:49:20.525 --> 00:49:24.019
They bound Me and I bound them too.

00:49:24.911 --> 00:49:28.348
It’s a mutual bounding which we enjoy among ourselves.

00:49:30.756 --> 00:49:34.368
There is such a give and take when there is such a bondage of love.

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:40.378
But do we understand the importance of bondage of love?

00:49:41.205 --> 00:49:43.205
At the slightest pretext we break it.

00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:46.770
Say wife says, “I would like to go out today”.

00:49:47.037 --> 00:49:48.074
The husband says “Why?

00:49:48.374 --> 00:49:49.945
I am very tired don’t you understand?“

00:49:51.541 --> 00:49:54.990
Or if the husband says, “I feel like eating something,”

00:49:55.027 --> 00:49:57.768
or some particular thing he says pancake or something,

00:49:58.043 --> 00:49:59.145
a small thing.

00:49:59.218 --> 00:50:01.286
“Oh I am very tired every time you are demanding.”

00:50:01.565 --> 00:50:04.473
If she could just think by making that little thing

00:50:04.539 --> 00:50:05.856
he would be so very happy.

00:50:05.873 --> 00:50:08.840
She should be dying to know what he wants.

00:50:08.875 --> 00:50:10.987
And he should be dying to do what she wants.

00:50:11.023 --> 00:50:13.185
And then enjoy each other’s company

00:50:13.238 --> 00:50:17.480
or you are wasting all your properties that you have as human beings.

00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:21.610
You don’t know how much you are wasting from each other.

00:50:23.309 --> 00:50:27.725
Every moment is filled with such beautiful bondages,

00:50:28.343 --> 00:50:31.204
where exchanges are there. What have you gained?

00:50:32.468 --> 00:50:34.468
The way you are fighting.

00:50:34.539 --> 00:50:36.126
The way you are going about.

00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:38.111
What have you gained let me see?

00:50:39.549 --> 00:50:41.620
When you die you have to announce in the paper

00:50:41.753 --> 00:50:44.564
that XYZ is dead and you find there is nobody.

00:50:44.594 --> 00:50:48.004
And you have even to pay for people to visit you when you die.

00:50:49.673 --> 00:50:51.123
This is the case today.

00:50:52.386 --> 00:50:56.553
Such dryness, such emptiness, such loneliness exists.

00:50:57.130 --> 00:50:58.905
What have you achieved through this.

00:51:00.906 --> 00:51:04.099
So this bondage we have to.

00:51:04.328 --> 00:51:07.233
And there is no question of sacrifice you see, the way.

00:51:07.264 --> 00:51:10.353
We must sacrifice for the family. What are you sacrificing?

00:51:12.407 --> 00:51:14.757
I mean if you pay for your family

00:51:14.897 --> 00:51:17.474
you get the joy out of it. That’s why you do it.

00:51:19.722 --> 00:51:22.770
If you have to lead a nice good life

00:51:23.596 --> 00:51:25.898
you are not sacrificing anything

00:51:26.278 --> 00:51:30.063
but you are gaining by that, leading a good life.

00:51:32.176 --> 00:51:34.694
If your wife says, “Don’t go to the pub,”

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:36.870
and if you do not go there,

00:51:37.206 --> 00:51:40.056
then you should not say she is an orthodox,

00:51:40.101 --> 00:51:42.864
old fashioned this that, that and that and that.

00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:45.216
But instead you should thank you stars that

00:51:45.226 --> 00:51:47.273
in this modern times also that there is somebody

00:51:47.286 --> 00:51:48.468
who’s telling you the truth.

00:51:51.185 --> 00:51:53.628
Because the whole edifice has come up,

00:51:53.903 --> 00:51:56.740
do you mean to say that truth should not be told?

00:51:58.264 --> 00:52:01.314
All this is falsehood in which you are living.

00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:04.599
And if you have to be happy come down to reality.

00:52:08.215 --> 00:52:09.848
Friends, also same thing.

00:52:10.263 --> 00:52:13.618
With the friends what sort of relations do we have with our friends?

00:52:14.043 --> 00:52:15.522
What do we expect from them?

00:52:15.823 --> 00:52:17.360
Sending them a Christmas card

00:52:19.277 --> 00:52:21.571
and then if they don’t send, feeling bad about it.

00:52:26.171 --> 00:52:29.629
There are no deeper bondages we have not lived with them.

00:52:29.679 --> 00:52:32.681
If you allow our self to be bound by them,

00:52:32.916 --> 00:52:34.916
they will be bound by us.

00:52:35.913 --> 00:52:37.913
You better try this.

00:52:38.219 --> 00:52:41.761
Try to be bound by them. Don’t be afraid of anybody else.

00:52:42.137 --> 00:52:44.463
Just try to be bound by others

00:52:44.707 --> 00:52:47.432
and you’ll be amazed how much they will be giving you.

00:52:47.617 --> 00:52:49.617
I am a living example of this.

00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:55.691
I can tell you I am a living example of this.

00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:57.222
I am bound by all of you.

00:52:58.474 --> 00:53:01.952
If somebody says, “Mother when are you going to leave us?”

00:53:02.113 --> 00:53:05.131
No I cannot. I cannot. I am just bound by you. I just

00:53:05.228 --> 00:53:07.988
do not want to leave because I love you very much.

00:53:08.105 --> 00:53:10.105
How can I leave you?

00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:12.316
It’s impossible for Me.

00:53:13.356 --> 00:53:15.731
So then, what do I gain out of this life?

00:53:15.791 --> 00:53:19.550
Everything that is in this world.

00:53:20.139 --> 00:53:21.572
What do you want Me to get?

00:53:22.273 --> 00:53:24.869
I cannot even count what I can get out of it.

00:53:26.278 --> 00:53:28.603
Immeasurable, ocean.

00:53:30.226 --> 00:53:32.632
I become an ocean Myself.

00:53:33.981 --> 00:53:38.647
Break your ideas about your own personal

00:53:38.767 --> 00:53:43.514
freedom and liberation, is liberating your intelligence.

00:53:45.933 --> 00:53:49.299
You‘re liberating your own wisdom.

00:53:51.578 --> 00:53:58.177
And the sweetness and the beauty which is never perishable

00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:00.410
whether you are old or young.

00:54:01.519 --> 00:54:03.770
That is going to be your own.

00:54:05.649 --> 00:54:09.475
But these poisons that are being built outside and inside you,

00:54:09.604 --> 00:54:10.870
please throw them away.

00:54:11.043 --> 00:54:15.370
These are mental poisons.

00:54:16.507 --> 00:54:18.752
Through Agnya you can take them out.

00:54:19.408 --> 00:54:22.215
You see, this is an opening also

00:54:22.326 --> 00:54:24.326
through which  many things go out.

00:54:26.818 --> 00:54:28.299
Try to work it out.

00:54:28.685 --> 00:54:32.698
Look at the tree with love

00:54:34.235 --> 00:54:36.515
and you’ll find that the tree itself

00:54:36.531 --> 00:54:38.925
is giving you the joy of its creation.

00:54:39.238 --> 00:54:40.994
Because you’ll become thoughtless.

00:54:41.568 --> 00:54:44.979
And the creator who has made that beautiful tree

00:54:45.027 --> 00:54:48.310
will be pouring all that joy which is stored into it into you.

00:54:49.519 --> 00:54:52.384
Every human being is a store of joy.

00:54:53.786 --> 00:54:58.178
Unlimited, I assure you, believe Me.

00:54:59.102 --> 00:55:04.404
And don’t waste them because somebody is not properly dressed,

00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:07.830
or he’s not according to the way

00:55:07.917 --> 00:55:11.252
you want him to be which you learnt in your public school.

00:55:13.572 --> 00:55:19.495
Every doorstep, everywhere there is beauty lying, do not miss it.

00:55:20.365 --> 00:55:25.917
But if you have possessiveness about it, an adultery about it,

00:55:28.558 --> 00:55:30.535
then you can never enjoy them.

00:55:33.532 --> 00:55:39.694
You can never enjoy all that beauty, all that store, all that wealth

00:55:40.505 --> 00:55:45.755
that is in every human being every moment it is bubbling.

00:55:47.228 --> 00:55:51.947
For Agnya it’s a good thing, Christmas is coming.

00:55:52.019 --> 00:55:54.955
And at the time that when I have to wish you Happy Christmas,

00:55:56.813 --> 00:56:02.152
that at this occasion I am speaking about Agnya Chakra

00:56:02.555 --> 00:56:06.292
in which, what I said is, Agnya is

00:56:06.664 --> 00:56:09.829
one must know what to order and how to obey.

00:56:10.941 --> 00:56:12.436
Obey the Divine.

00:56:13.311 --> 00:56:14.870
Obey your elders.

00:56:16.878 --> 00:56:20.772
Obey your self and not your ego.

00:56:22.581 --> 00:56:25.566
And then you can order also others.

00:56:27.025 --> 00:56:29.041
Not only human beings,

00:56:29.076 --> 00:56:31.886
but you can even order the sun and the moon and

00:56:31.919 --> 00:56:33.919
all the winds and everything in the world.

00:56:35.657 --> 00:56:39.397
Everything you can control, everything with this Agnya.

00:56:40.127 --> 00:56:41.434
You try one thing.

00:56:42.186 --> 00:56:44.715
If you know somebody is going to do something wrong,

00:56:44.875 --> 00:56:50.715
just take his name and put it to Agnya. He’ll not do it, try it.

00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:54.144
This is a trick I’m telling about

00:56:54.802 --> 00:56:56.442
for those who are realized souls

00:56:56.469 --> 00:56:58.091
not for those who are not yet realized

00:56:58.108 --> 00:56:59.762
but those who are realized can try.

00:57:00.881 --> 00:57:02.881
If the other person is doing something wrong

00:57:02.925 --> 00:57:04.357
you can try your Agnya.

00:57:04.626 --> 00:57:07.441
Anything you order on your Agnya will be respected

00:57:07.965 --> 00:57:09.965
but your Agnya must have Christ there.

00:57:11.138 --> 00:57:17.211
Because you have the great support awakened within you,

00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:21.613
which does not exist here but into every man’s head.

00:57:23.503 --> 00:57:28.301
It is all pervading into all small atoms and molecules, it is

00:57:28.397 --> 00:57:32.681
everywhere into the sun and any place you go. It is there.

00:57:35.948 --> 00:57:42.330
So try to develop your Agnya that is the mastery of your self.

00:57:43.287 --> 00:57:46.563
Those who have a good Agnya can master anything

00:57:47.071 --> 00:57:51.950
and understand that the idea about mastering

00:57:52.004 --> 00:57:55.232
worldly things and mastering human beings and mastering this

00:57:55.344 --> 00:58:00.022
and some of them are mastering in, say, other crafts and things,

00:58:00.304 --> 00:58:02.304
best thing is to master your Agnya.

00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:07.437
And you really become the master of yourself

00:58:07.889 --> 00:58:10.316
by which you can master many things.

00:58:10.850 --> 00:58:13.699
And today on this great day

00:58:13.964 --> 00:58:17.778
when I’m wishing you a Happy Christmas, I wish you to have

00:58:19.002 --> 00:58:22.563
the most powerful Agnyas,

00:58:22.762 --> 00:58:24.762
that people when they see your forehead

00:58:24.891 --> 00:58:28.483
should know that Christ is reborn again with in you.

00:58:28.826 --> 00:58:29.871
May God bless you.
