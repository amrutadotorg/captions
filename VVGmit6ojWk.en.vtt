WEBVTT

00:03.493 --> 00:06.803
Actually Christians do not know anything about His becoming.

00:07.201 --> 00:11.076
How He became Christ or what was the need

00:11.396 --> 00:14.625
to have Christ or a son to come down.

00:14.696 --> 00:16.854
Why not God Himself could do the job.

00:17.300 --> 00:20.390
And this is the reason why I would request you to read

00:20.663 --> 00:24.777
for yourself the incarnation of

00:24.820 --> 00:28.375
Maha Vishnu by which you realize why Christ was born.

00:30.053 --> 00:33.914
And it is the most important incarnation

00:35.033 --> 00:39.323
because He is the principle.

00:40.651 --> 00:43.917
He is the principle of creation.

00:44.612 --> 00:47.269
The Tattwa as they call it in Sanskrit language.

00:47.350 --> 00:48.450
He is the tattwa.

00:49.157 --> 00:52.349
Ganesha, who resides in the Mooladhara

00:53.316 --> 00:58.440
gradually evolves to be Christ at this stage.

00:59.224 --> 01:04.963
From that red Chakra up to this Chakra He became the Christ.

01:06.865 --> 01:11.689
He is the principle. Now what is the principle?

01:14.849 --> 01:17.490
Within us what is our principle?

01:17.948 --> 01:20.043
Is say the Kundalini you can say?

01:21.162 --> 01:24.491
In this the electricity is the principle of this one is.

01:25.007 --> 01:27.007
In the same way the creation,

01:28.337 --> 01:30.667
the whole creation if you take it as such,

01:30.895 --> 01:35.338
it is the principle and the support of this creation.

01:38.188 --> 01:46.515
He represents, He represents the essence,

01:46.869 --> 01:48.869
the essence of creation.

01:49.351 --> 01:52.191
Like we can say we have a family,

01:52.526 --> 01:55.138
husband and wife and the child.

01:55.814 --> 01:59.788
Now the child is the essence of husband and wife.

02:01.807 --> 02:05.374
He is the essence of the family, of the house.

02:05.998 --> 02:11.256
The whole thing is sustained for him, is created for him.

02:11.864 --> 02:13.861
Till they did not have the child

02:15.517 --> 02:18.160
there was no meaning to that house,

02:18.358 --> 02:19.786
no meaning to their life.

02:20.184 --> 02:21.801
But when they had a child

02:22.120 --> 02:23.118
then they had a meaning.

02:23.176 --> 02:26.062
In the same way Christ is the essence,

02:26.360 --> 02:27.820
is the tattwa itself.

02:28.104 --> 02:29.802
He’s the Omkara as they call it.

02:29.850 --> 02:33.193
He is the first sound,

02:33.675 --> 02:36.097
first sound that was created AUM

02:36.419 --> 02:40.952
when the Primordial Father and Primordial Mother separated,

02:41.298 --> 02:42.714
They created this sound.

02:42.773 --> 02:44.529
And He is that sound

02:45.095 --> 02:48.090
which is filled into All-Pervading Power

02:48.257 --> 02:52.491
and looks after and supports,

02:52.972 --> 02:54.972
actually it is more the support

02:54.997 --> 02:57.249
because looking after is done by the Father

02:57.441 --> 02:58.627
you can say or by the Mother.

02:58.713 --> 03:02.312
But is the support of all the universe.

03:06.334 --> 03:10.364
And because He is just the essence, the essence never dies.

03:12.899 --> 03:15.782
Say My essence is My Spirit,

03:16.207 --> 03:17.523
it will never die.

03:18.759 --> 03:21.840
The body dies or the creation will die

03:21.993 --> 03:24.151
but the essence has to be there.

03:24.733 --> 03:27.486
If the essence is lost then nothing could be there

03:27.637 --> 03:31.025
that’s why He is the most important incarnation.

03:31.236 --> 03:33.218
Because He is the support.

03:35.001 --> 03:39.942
Now this incarnation is placed in this Agnya Chakra of ours.

03:40.770 --> 03:42.968
Here in the center where

03:43.010 --> 03:46.635
the optic nerve or optic thalamus cross each other like this.

03:46.714 --> 03:48.941
In the center is a very subtle point

03:50.061 --> 03:52.912
which moves both the sides like this and like that

03:53.797 --> 03:58.576
and it creates two sounds Ham Ksham, Ham Ksham, Ham Ksham.

04:00.818 --> 04:04.877
Ham is on the right hand side where you have seen

04:05.783 --> 04:08.433
the superego is there

04:08.689 --> 04:13.162
and Ksham is on the left hand side where the ego is.

04:13.736 --> 04:16.260
Now these two sounds create

04:16.310 --> 04:20.653
two kinds of vibrations.

04:21.224 --> 04:28.344
The Ham sound creates the vibrations,

04:28.502 --> 04:31.144
which make you think, “I am, I am.

04:32.948 --> 04:34.307
Ham, I am.”

04:35.746 --> 04:37.971
This comes from our existence power

04:38.024 --> 04:40.082
that we know we have to live in this world,

04:40.335 --> 04:41.577
we’re not going to die.

04:41.874 --> 04:45.604
Any human being who tries to kill himself is abnormal.

04:46.136 --> 04:48.769
Normally every human being,

04:48.830 --> 04:54.794
why every animal or any living thing tries to retain its life.

04:55.158 --> 04:58.578
That is through this power of Ham that I am.

04:59.595 --> 05:01.478
Now the superego on the left hand side

05:01.493 --> 05:04.098
and the ego on the right hand side is Ksham.

05:05.418 --> 05:08.905
But now I’ll tell you about the right hand side superego.

05:10.633 --> 05:15.963
In this superego when you are

05:16.162 --> 05:21.176
conditioned by so many things, then you are frightened

05:21.819 --> 05:25.951
and you are worried because these experiences

05:26.161 --> 05:30.762
make you that type of a person which has fear in the mind.

05:31.386 --> 05:34.600
And this fear is all settled in your superego.

05:35.056 --> 05:37.636
This starts from your amoeba stage you can say

05:37.854 --> 05:40.257
and is still today is being stored there.

05:40.308 --> 05:42.791
You are afraid of police, you are afraid of that,

05:42.935 --> 05:43.920
you are afraid of this.

05:44.097 --> 05:46.052
Some people are not afraid of these things

05:46.066 --> 05:47.604
but are afraid of something else.

05:47.791 --> 05:50.793
Because whatever have been your conditions,

05:51.427 --> 05:54.796
whatever have been your experiences

05:54.912 --> 05:56.860
are all put down here.

05:57.188 --> 05:59.905
Moreover when somebody reads the book of “Dracula”

06:00.016 --> 06:01.586
now he’s afraid of the word Dracula

06:01.705 --> 06:03.296
but the children who do not read

06:03.462 --> 06:05.009
they do not know what is a Dracula is.

06:05.037 --> 06:06.458
If you say Dracula has come they say

06:06.478 --> 06:07.862
all right lets have a look at him.

06:09.327 --> 06:11.687
But those children have read about Dracula,

06:11.811 --> 06:13.068
they are literally frightened and

06:13.092 --> 06:14.769
they say, “Oh God, Dracula is coming,

06:14.792 --> 06:16.174
something terrible is going to happen.”

06:16.645 --> 06:18.432
So you see whatever you have read,

06:18.547 --> 06:20.155
whatever you have gone through

06:20.252 --> 06:22.029
whatever experiences you have had

06:22.131 --> 06:24.562
all is in the superego.

06:25.343 --> 06:32.844
So this superego in that this center sends message,

06:33.087 --> 06:37.603
I am, you are, you are Ham, Ham don’t be afraid,

06:37.685 --> 06:39.179
don’t be afraid, you are.

06:40.647 --> 06:43.523
So the people who come to Me, and you have seen

06:43.545 --> 06:46.631
some people who come to Me are victims of

06:46.640 --> 06:47.875
superego conditioning.

06:49.174 --> 06:50.457
And these are the people,

06:50.552 --> 06:53.514
actually at this stage only you can really discriminate

06:53.703 --> 06:54.702
between the two types.

06:55.097 --> 06:56.652
One who are very aggressive,

06:56.742 --> 06:59.106
the other who are absolutely

06:59.210 --> 07:05.110
we should say subordinated, frightened.

07:05.761 --> 07:08.677
These people when they come to Me

07:08.705 --> 07:10.733
I have seen, they go on crying and weeping,

07:10.775 --> 07:13.986
“Mother you know this has happened that has happened,” and

07:14.106 --> 07:16.470
I really get tired talking to them.

07:16.684 --> 07:19.769
And there are so many of this kind

07:19.956 --> 07:22.018
that really you have to

07:22.036 --> 07:23.951
pay attention to them as Sahaja Yogis

07:24.038 --> 07:26.459
because you’ll have to deal with them, how to,

07:26.606 --> 07:28.587
how to manage them and how to work it out.

07:28.965 --> 07:31.320
Now at that time if a Sahaja yogi says,

07:31.552 --> 07:35.464
now you go on saying Ham, Ham, Ham, Ham,

07:35.606 --> 07:37.456
a Sahaja Yogi if he says

07:37.554 --> 07:40.347
then the vibrations will drive out his fear.

07:40.964 --> 07:43.210
Even if you are under any fear

07:43.260 --> 07:46.015
and you are walking around and you feel that there’s

07:46.125 --> 07:48.788
frightened, you just say Ham, Ham, Ham.

07:48.954 --> 07:52.722
Now with this saying the vibrations will clear out

07:52.859 --> 07:55.353
this side very nicely.

07:55.364 --> 07:59.122
Apart from that, that is the way you can get help

07:59.176 --> 08:01.359
from the Divine by saying Ham.

08:02.469 --> 08:04.783
Now there are many things about Ham and Ksham but

08:04.815 --> 08:06.284
as the time is you know,

08:06.384 --> 08:09.081
so I do not want to go into great details about it.

08:09.335 --> 08:10.708
But I would say the mantra

08:10.909 --> 08:13.051
for the right hand side is Ham

08:14.156 --> 08:16.401
and for the left hand side is Ksham.

08:18.087 --> 08:19.854
The right hand side is the ego,

08:20.312 --> 08:23.061
which is real problem, you understand that,

08:23.332 --> 08:27.370
is a real colossal one you have to face them, I mean.

08:27.662 --> 08:30.965
I say anything small here and there I find the whole thing

08:30.995 --> 08:32.978
coming up onto my head like that.

08:33.364 --> 08:36.594
So what is the solution for a colossal ego?

08:37.132 --> 08:43.864
Colossal ego can only be conquered by forgiving others.

08:45.650 --> 08:49.243
Those who have ego must learn

08:49.773 --> 08:51.773
if they feel hurt they must say, “forgive.”

08:53.360 --> 08:55.730
Then another person hurts them, say, “forgive.”

08:56.442 --> 08:59.724
And not only forgive but ask for forgiveness.

09:00.121 --> 09:03.427
Both things should be done, more asking for forgiveness.

09:04.044 --> 09:07.707
You have to ask for forgiveness if you have too much of ego.

09:07.749 --> 09:08.938
It is very important.

09:09.107 --> 09:12.265
Because if you have too much of ego means what?

09:12.360 --> 09:14.360
That you have pampered it too much.

09:15.085 --> 09:17.251
That means you have used it too much.

09:17.592 --> 09:19.592
You have dominated people

09:19.745 --> 09:22.089
and that’s why you have such a lot of ego.

09:22.475 --> 09:24.475
If you have such a lot of ego

09:24.555 --> 09:28.155
you must all the time try to humble down in your heart.

09:28.755 --> 09:31.048
Now in the heart resides the Spirit.

09:32.164 --> 09:35.358
The ego, too much of ego in a person

09:35.420 --> 09:38.193
always takes you away from that Spirit.

09:38.350 --> 09:40.849
That’s why it is said, “Humble down in your heart.”

09:41.367 --> 09:43.225
The reason is, in the heart

09:43.320 --> 09:48.795
resides that part of yours which gets completely obliterated

09:48.809 --> 09:53.286
or forgotten once you start pumping up your ego.

09:53.946 --> 09:59.108
But ego has its limits, it ends up into stupidity and foolishness.

10:00.358 --> 10:02.911
You take any person who is egoistical

10:03.799 --> 10:06.120
and who’s blowing his own trumpet.

10:06.306 --> 10:09.285
You will immediately know because he’ll be stupid.

10:10.598 --> 10:13.135
Without understanding what he’s doing

10:13.566 --> 10:15.289
he’ll be doing such stupid things

10:15.650 --> 10:18.084
that you will start wondering, especially children,

10:18.184 --> 10:21.024
“What’s the matter with this fellow, he is quite funny?”

10:23.194 --> 10:25.953
And then the stupidity you see faces the person

10:26.115 --> 10:28.289
then he sees for himself, “Oh God!

10:29.830 --> 10:31.380
how did I become so stupid?”

10:31.843 --> 10:34.142
The stupidity comes to you because

10:34.169 --> 10:36.452
you forget the existence of God

10:36.565 --> 10:39.118
and your relationship with the whole.

10:41.045 --> 10:42.510
You think, “I am on my own.

10:43.156 --> 10:44.682
Why should I not do this?

10:45.306 --> 10:46.577
What is wrong in this,

10:47.061 --> 10:48.317
what is wrong in that?

10:48.768 --> 10:49.826
I should do these things.”

10:49.835 --> 10:53.009
I mean in this country the way people are fighting for things.

10:53.327 --> 10:57.639
I mean you must, anybody I mean, those so-called developing countries

10:57.835 --> 11:01.921
can’t understand what kind of a thing happening to these people.

11:01.950 --> 11:05.759
Because the other day My son-in-law Lav was reading

11:05.907 --> 11:09.521
an article that people are demanding now that

11:09.591 --> 11:12.442
the son-in-law should be allowed to marry the mother-in-law.

11:12.546 --> 11:16.249
And he just couldn’t understand how can people gather together

11:16.379 --> 11:20.027
and ask for such an absurd thing like that. She is your mother.

11:20.117 --> 11:21.570
How can you say that way?

11:21.879 --> 11:24.155
I mean it is something an impossibility

11:24.510 --> 11:27.409
for people, normal people to think like that.

11:27.574 --> 11:28.577
That a son-in-law

11:28.668 --> 11:29.846
can marry the mother-in-law.

11:29.882 --> 11:31.624
And what is there to make a law about it

11:31.687 --> 11:34.176
and to talk about it. It’s a very difficult thing.

11:35.103 --> 11:38.050
All kinds of stupid things we are doing in this country,

11:38.115 --> 11:41.458
which really makes everybody roar with laughter.

11:42.657 --> 11:46.997
Is because of our Mr. Ego companionship.

11:47.592 --> 11:51.129
It is not easy to understand how he befools us.

11:51.502 --> 11:54.328
It goes on befooling us all the time

11:54.410 --> 11:56.107
and then we think what’s wrong?

11:56.426 --> 11:58.144
An eighty-year-old man

11:58.925 --> 12:00.925
running after a twenty-year-old girl.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.077
And the twenty-year-old girl befooling this

12:03.222 --> 12:07.035
eighty-year-old man, supposed to be a statesman this, that

12:07.125 --> 12:09.831
and his statue is erected somewhere there.

12:10.209 --> 12:11.618
How is it possible?

12:14.015 --> 12:18.934
It is only the ego makes you do all these nonsensical and

12:19.053 --> 12:19.865
stupid things.

12:20.270 --> 12:21.775
Once you are in Sahaja Yoga

12:21.907 --> 12:24.599
you don’t know how to control your laughter sometimes the way

12:24.768 --> 12:26.269
people are foolish.

12:26.647 --> 12:27.964
Extremely foolish.

12:28.122 --> 12:32.830
And this is what it is; it ends up in stupidity absolute stupidity.

12:33.170 --> 12:36.502
I mean even if you want to write a novel

12:36.522 --> 12:38.761
you won’t get such beautiful characters

12:38.867 --> 12:41.254
as you could around you, when you listen to them.

12:41.281 --> 12:43.333
And you’re shocked, Oh God what’s this going on

12:43.350 --> 12:45.166
and very embarrassing too.

12:45.452 --> 12:51.813
Extremely embarrassing and they become so foolish

12:51.925 --> 12:59.528
with their ego that one cannot understand how thinking man,

12:59.813 --> 13:01.813
because by thinking you get your ego,

13:02.169 --> 13:03.619
becomes foolish.

13:05.137 --> 13:07.022
There is no wisdom

13:07.824 --> 13:11.250
in a person whose ego is completely developed like that.

13:11.738 --> 13:15.696
If somebody has an ego like that there is no wisdom in him.

13:15.898 --> 13:18.674
You can see that he does not know what is wisdom.

13:19.823 --> 13:22.059
He behaves in such an immature way.

13:22.240 --> 13:25.581
He may be an elderly man, great grandfather of

13:25.595 --> 13:28.957
somebody but as soon as he opens his mouth you are shocked at him.

13:29.143 --> 13:31.053
You think from where this joker has come?

13:32.961 --> 13:34.852
The maturity is completely lacking.

13:34.862 --> 13:36.818
The other day somebody told Me that,

13:36.852 --> 13:41.597
“Mother how is it our parents are so stupid and we are searching God?

13:43.138 --> 13:47.025
And the elderly people are so foolish and we are searching God?”

13:48.117 --> 13:49.946
And then I said, “No, maybe because of war

13:49.985 --> 13:51.615
the parents are disturbed, you see”.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.716
Most of the parents were disturbed during war

13:53.910 --> 13:56.396
and they said, “Majority of them are like this.

13:56.975 --> 14:00.023
And the younger people are searching God and much wiser

14:00.287 --> 14:02.099
and we don’t know how to compromise with them

14:02.126 --> 14:03.557
because they are not searching God.

14:04.447 --> 14:07.310
Why is it they are not searching God and we are searching God?

14:07.679 --> 14:10.432
And if there are some searching, they are very few.”

14:11.800 --> 14:14.087
Now I said this may be due to war but somebody said,

14:14.101 --> 14:15.616
“Then what about America? You see,

14:15.730 --> 14:18.113
in America the people didn’t face war so much,

14:18.305 --> 14:21.428
the stupidity that they have is sometimes surprising.”

14:24.418 --> 14:26.684
That is the same thing as I said,

14:26.976 --> 14:29.968
is the development of ego in a human being.

14:30.733 --> 14:35.593
Now ego is the thing that makes you think about everything.

14:36.358 --> 14:37.537
For example, now

14:38.062 --> 14:42.033
we have to, say go from here to Birmingham, all right.

14:42.250 --> 14:43.928
So we think now how will I go?

14:45.491 --> 14:48.058
Simple way is that I’ll take a train or I’ll

14:48.087 --> 14:49.924
take a car and go away.

14:50.060 --> 14:51.795
If there’s no reservation needed I will

14:51.809 --> 14:54.071
just jump into the train or going by the car.

14:54.082 --> 14:55.998
If the car is available I’ll go by car

14:56.018 --> 14:57.112
or by train finished.

14:57.352 --> 14:58.686
What is there to think about?

15:00.168 --> 15:00.677
But no,

15:00.759 --> 15:03.763
then we must plan it out, “I’m programmed now I have to go”.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.716
You go to the station and find the train is not there

15:07.792 --> 15:10.165
because there was some accident so the train is not moving.

15:10.845 --> 15:13.637
So you are absolutely upset because

15:13.776 --> 15:15.697
you think that the train has gone now what to do.

15:16.472 --> 15:18.935
In that upsetting you do not even remember that

15:18.966 --> 15:20.797
you have a car and you have to go by the car.

15:21.865 --> 15:25.255
Now that whole things upsets you because you had plans

15:25.295 --> 15:28.325
to go by train and you had planned everything, now you

15:28.350 --> 15:31.165
cannot reach there and what will happen?

15:31.571 --> 15:34.297
Now you are sitting here and worrying about it.

15:34.716 --> 15:37.102
As a person who is spontaneous what will you do?

15:37.920 --> 15:40.088
All right depends on, I may go by train

15:40.139 --> 15:42.219
or by car whatever I feel like at that time.

15:43.057 --> 15:44.013
He is sitting tight.

15:44.682 --> 15:46.086
So he goes to the train,

15:46.510 --> 15:49.248
sees if the train is there. If it is, nicely

15:49.456 --> 15:52.477
there’s a space available he gets into it.

15:52.766 --> 15:54.567
If the train is not available, all right,

15:54.604 --> 15:56.651
he comes home takes his car and goes away.

15:57.150 --> 15:58.871
So now you have informed the people that

15:58.926 --> 16:00.345
you must meet at such and such a place.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.779
That’s also is there you see.

16:02.253 --> 16:04.253
So those people are running up down there

16:04.415 --> 16:05.963
and they will be there at the station.

16:07.041 --> 16:08.303
Now what’s the matter?

16:08.316 --> 16:10.634
Even if they’re at the station you can meet them at the station.

16:10.645 --> 16:12.716
You go by train and you can meet them.

16:12.912 --> 16:14.780
What is there to be that much upset about it?

16:15.367 --> 16:17.421
You see you can always contact them.

16:17.579 --> 16:20.824
But the way we get upset we have spoiled

16:20.855 --> 16:23.460
the complete program of going to Birmingham,

16:23.547 --> 16:27.098
which is a very beautiful program that we have got.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.781
We have to meet new people, we have to meet

16:28.821 --> 16:30.834
many people, we have to enjoy ourselves.

16:31.097 --> 16:32.365
That’s all finished

16:32.755 --> 16:35.314
because we had planned something and it

16:35.331 --> 16:36.806
did not work out, we are finished.

16:37.842 --> 16:41.981
All these things make us a miserable person.

16:42.696 --> 16:45.607
And we are so miserable and so grudging and

16:45.689 --> 16:48.803
so boring that those who are next to you just get fed up

16:48.848 --> 16:50.029
with it and they say,

16:50.061 --> 16:51.156
“Now shut up.

16:52.615 --> 16:54.726
If you are not going to Birmingham,

16:55.160 --> 16:58.424
if you are not going don’t go. But don’t eat my head now”,

16:58.710 --> 17:01.113
is a common experience of many.

17:01.857 --> 17:05.796
If this Mr. Ego he’s so, he doesn’t want you to be happy.

17:08.232 --> 17:10.295
He doesn’t want you to be relaxed.

17:10.498 --> 17:12.409
He all the time gives you ideas

17:12.436 --> 17:14.532
and tells you, “Do this and do that

17:14.567 --> 17:17.134
and you must get it done and this is to be done and You

17:17.151 --> 17:18.479
had better inform that person,

17:18.612 --> 17:19.808
be meticulous about it,”

17:20.084 --> 17:21.952
and it will go to such details

17:22.132 --> 17:24.227
that anything fails you are finished

17:24.584 --> 17:26.946
because your nerves are already finished and shattered.

17:27.225 --> 17:32.331
Anything, even a drop of inconvenience comes into you

17:32.433 --> 17:36.840
or even a feather of disturbance is there, you are finished.

17:36.997 --> 17:40.453
And so everybody is rattling, ”We have tensions. We have problems.”

17:40.506 --> 17:41.039
Why?

17:46.891 --> 17:50.888
What is the advantage of doing all these things?

17:50.948 --> 17:53.928
No advantage you know that. But then why do you do it?

17:53.975 --> 17:56.806
Because you have a big ego. It won’t allow you to rest.

17:57.856 --> 18:01.159
Whatever you may try it won’t. So what is the solution of that?

18:02.139 --> 18:05.339
Morning till evening ask for forgiveness from God.

18:05.514 --> 18:07.293
Pull your ears from both the sides

18:07.661 --> 18:09.132
and say, “Oh God, forgive me.

18:09.520 --> 18:12.114
Oh God, forgive me. And, oh God forgive me,”

18:12.214 --> 18:14.214
so this balloon of ego goes down a little.

18:16.155 --> 18:19.394
Remember Him morning, evening, every time.

18:20.398 --> 18:23.886
Remembering Christ brings down your ego very much.

18:24.940 --> 18:27.321
He did everything that was possible

18:27.401 --> 18:29.601
that you should not develop your ego.

18:29.871 --> 18:31.587
Everything that was possible.

18:31.868 --> 18:34.694
He was born as an ordinary carpenter’s son.

18:36.111 --> 18:38.703
Lived in the most ordinary conditions.

18:40.678 --> 18:44.411
Kept Himself behind the whole scene.

18:44.605 --> 18:46.605
He could have been born as Roman Emperor.

18:49.052 --> 18:51.087
He could have been anybody there.

18:51.416 --> 18:53.753
But no He was born Himself.

18:54.021 --> 18:56.168
You know that He took his birth

18:56.412 --> 19:02.061
in a place where even ordinary people do not take their births.

19:03.062 --> 19:05.770
But, there also the light was there.

19:05.968 --> 19:08.901
Wherever He was born there was light and joy.

19:10.274 --> 19:12.484
And this is the thing we have to know, that

19:12.560 --> 19:17.089
we have lost the joy because we have forgotten God Almighty.

19:18.171 --> 19:24.610
When we forget Him, that He is love and He is joy,

19:24.763 --> 19:26.763
naturally joy is also forgotten.

19:27.523 --> 19:30.238
And then we see people are not at all happy.

19:30.335 --> 19:33.056
They have affluence, they have money, they have everything,

19:33.274 --> 19:35.102
but still they are not happy.

19:35.151 --> 19:38.916
All the time they are in such a mess

19:39.095 --> 19:41.029
that you don’t know how to talk to them.

19:41.165 --> 19:43.165
If you say this word they’ll be angry.

19:43.380 --> 19:44.973
If you say that word they’ll be angry.

19:45.515 --> 19:48.015
They are not at all normal human beings.

19:48.104 --> 19:50.104
They are sick people.

19:50.171 --> 19:51.999
Sick with their ego.

19:53.076 --> 19:56.684
It’s a very simple thing is to ask for forgiveness.

19:57.130 --> 19:59.130
How many times do we do that?

19:59.793 --> 20:06.170
Not even once a day, not even once a month, not even once a year.

20:06.772 --> 20:09.651
Even on a Christmas day if we could say,

20:09.729 --> 20:13.681
“Forgive us Oh Lord for whatever we have done so far.”

20:13.799 --> 20:14.709
It will work out.

20:14.868 --> 20:19.255
But that day we must champagne to forgive Him more.

20:20.517 --> 20:22.184
So we must have gossips

20:22.421 --> 20:23.781
and we must have

20:23.957 --> 20:28.192
all the arrogant things by the time it is the end of Christmas.

20:32.869 --> 20:35.393
This ego, yellow side one,

20:35.562 --> 20:39.489
is the one that presses your superego too much. It does.

20:40.077 --> 20:44.675
It presses it so much sometimes that a person forgets

20:45.068 --> 20:48.026
that others are hurt by what they talk.

20:48.370 --> 20:50.620
On the contrary they devise methods

20:50.713 --> 20:53.964
how to say things which are cutting,

20:55.514 --> 20:59.101
which are hurting, which are painful to others.

20:59.881 --> 21:03.191
They say such things, I mean all the time if you see.

21:03.203 --> 21:06.055
A person say from a village if he comes and sees

21:06.090 --> 21:08.641
he’ll think, are they quarreling, what are they doing?

21:08.661 --> 21:10.103
I mean the whole discussion,

21:10.286 --> 21:12.673
even in the parliament I was surprised

21:12.877 --> 21:17.066
the way they talked to each other, no bull will

21:17.153 --> 21:19.902
treat another bull that way, see.

21:20.324 --> 21:24.346
Even a dog normally does not bark at another dog.

21:25.018 --> 21:30.015
No animal in the world all the time is barking at its fellow man.

21:30.057 --> 21:32.662
No animal in the whole world I can tell you this much.

21:32.952 --> 21:34.259
Only the human beings

21:34.280 --> 21:37.104
if two people are there all the time they are going, ha ha ha ha

21:37.138 --> 21:40.380
all the time that way. How is it possible?

21:40.513 --> 21:45.228
His ego and her ego or maybe both his ego

21:45.338 --> 21:47.011
are dashing at each other.

21:47.161 --> 21:52.829
And there is a kind of a funny type

21:52.917 --> 21:56.751
of feeling that oh I have mastered the thing,

21:57.297 --> 21:59.297
I have got the thing, I have got the point.

21:59.352 --> 22:01.000
I have proved the point.

22:01.248 --> 22:05.270
But in that I have lost everything that was so beautiful

22:05.364 --> 22:08.004
and so much joy giving within me.

22:08.225 --> 22:11.084
Actually a sensible person would recede

22:11.202 --> 22:14.455
from the place where two people are having an argument.

22:14.992 --> 22:18.980
Argument is a sign of tomfoolery.

22:20.089 --> 22:24.575
I haven’t seen any argument coming to any end whatsoever.

22:24.799 --> 22:26.572
If it is then it is all right.

22:26.605 --> 22:28.232
But it never does come.

22:28.485 --> 22:33.391
Because, if say, you ask Me questions I answer you, all right.

22:33.761 --> 22:36.029
If you do not like the answer give it up.

22:36.575 --> 22:39.652
But if you argue with Me still and I argue with you

22:39.794 --> 22:40.819
where will you end?

22:41.517 --> 22:44.987
Argument is not going to lead you to any knowledge

22:45.533 --> 22:49.789
but a very terrible ego developing into you.

22:50.858 --> 22:55.372
The whole modern concept is ego oriented.

22:56.510 --> 22:59.394
All western countries are ego orientated.

22:59.775 --> 23:02.086
They want to develop your ego and pamper it.

23:02.116 --> 23:04.292
There are so many other ways by which they do.

23:04.601 --> 23:06.925
Why I’m talking more about it because we are all

23:06.992 --> 23:09.835
supposed to be western people and affluent people you see.

23:09.845 --> 23:12.403
Supposed to be very wise and leading

23:12.464 --> 23:15.156
or misleading, I don’t know, the developing countries.

23:15.292 --> 23:18.140
So we have to understand ourselves where are we

23:18.180 --> 23:21.108
as far as our understanding of things are concerned.

23:21.426 --> 23:26.646
How ego is pampered within us is by a large-scale method.

23:27.826 --> 23:31.288
They work on your ego throughout to have all these

23:31.323 --> 23:33.183
so-called enterprises.

23:33.368 --> 23:35.126
For example to a woman they’ll say,

23:35.238 --> 23:37.736
“Oh you must have a waist like this and you must

23:37.747 --> 23:39.466
have a face like this and you must have –“

23:39.502 --> 23:42.779
For a man, “You must this kind of a body.

23:42.793 --> 23:45.411
You should be Mr. Universe or you should be something,”

23:45.561 --> 23:47.654
so the man starts working on it immediately.

23:48.223 --> 23:49.906
You must, there so many people I have seen

23:49.916 --> 23:52.338
running on the roads in this cold, I don’t understand.

23:52.602 --> 23:53.916
Like mad you know and some of

23:53.920 --> 23:55.135
them are Member of Parliament.

23:55.143 --> 23:56.734
The whole night they keep awake and the whole day

23:56.769 --> 23:57.714
they are running about.

23:57.799 --> 23:59.482
I say what are you doing?

23:59.636 --> 24:01.097
What is the need to do this?

24:01.240 --> 24:03.448
To keep good health you must do it.

24:03.961 --> 24:06.222
To keep good health don’t work like mad,

24:06.583 --> 24:09.559
be a sensible and a wise person.

24:10.845 --> 24:13.765
Wisdom is to be sought to keep good health,

24:13.908 --> 24:18.391
to be all right and not this kind of mad ego orientated things.

24:18.640 --> 24:23.917
So then the one way is to excite your ego about your physique.

24:24.360 --> 24:27.356
Then there is ego about, you must have a big car.

24:28.243 --> 24:30.865
You see people try to show off their possessions.

24:31.002 --> 24:32.093
You have a big car,

24:32.186 --> 24:35.349
then they’re going about. I mean they really look to me like jokers,

24:35.379 --> 24:36.321
that’s all they are.

24:36.934 --> 24:39.189
I mean car I can understand is a convenience

24:39.241 --> 24:42.132
and a good quality car if somebody can afford it should have it

24:42.138 --> 24:45.053
because it is a headache to have a bad car. So it’s all right.

24:45.636 --> 24:48.222
But by having a car you become something great.

24:48.337 --> 24:49.741
You may not have food in the house

24:49.777 --> 24:52.240
but you must have a very good car to go about.

24:52.368 --> 24:54.131
And all these ideas come.

24:54.209 --> 24:56.293
Then they will advertise, you see, this will

24:56.366 --> 24:58.366
be a very good car for you.

24:58.547 --> 24:59.555
What is it for you?

24:59.563 --> 25:02.244
It is nothing but to pamper your ego.

25:02.437 --> 25:04.464
All these advertisements are nothing

25:04.547 --> 25:06.821
but by which your ego is pampered.

25:07.058 --> 25:08.651
All these things they’re treated.

25:08.715 --> 25:11.605
Now in America if you go every handle has to be different.

25:11.620 --> 25:12.875
Everything has to be different.

25:12.928 --> 25:15.127
Why so much difference in everything?

25:15.196 --> 25:17.961
Why do you want to have everything so different?

25:18.837 --> 25:21.190
Is it some aesthetics, you think in that?

25:21.692 --> 25:25.925
It is none of the aesthetics but is just to pamper your ego.

25:25.941 --> 25:28.176
Even the so-called art connoisseurs

25:28.269 --> 25:30.801
are nothing but ego pamperers.

25:30.993 --> 25:33.281
Your stamp collections this, that,

25:33.354 --> 25:35.695
all this is nothing but ego pampering.

25:35.724 --> 25:38.615
And what a waste of time, you just think about it.

25:40.423 --> 25:43.500
This ego thing comes into us

25:43.920 --> 25:48.384
because we are first of all, as I said, that in the west

25:48.617 --> 25:50.433
the living was very difficult.

25:50.458 --> 25:51.764
They had to fight the nature.

25:51.905 --> 25:53.905
And when you have to fight the nature

25:53.928 --> 25:55.866
you have to develop your ego to fight it.

25:56.196 --> 25:58.594
Or actually when you are fighting the nature

25:58.693 --> 25:59.838
the ego develops within you.

26:00.980 --> 26:03.529
And then once that momentum has started in you

26:03.645 --> 26:06.014
it is very difficult to bring it down.

26:06.234 --> 26:10.127
It is such a terrible disease that

26:10.469 --> 26:14.249
people have taken it for granted that that’s a part of their lives.

26:14.611 --> 26:17.553
You are not your ego. You are not.

26:18.463 --> 26:21.597
When I say that you must surrender yourself to God

26:21.678 --> 26:23.678
they think Mother why should we surrender?

26:24.075 --> 26:27.297
Yourself means that ego with which you are identified.

26:27.336 --> 26:31.352
I don’t say that you surrender your wisdom.

26:32.090 --> 26:35.372
Or I can say surrender your ego to your wisdom.

26:37.086 --> 26:39.376
But it is so difficult to give it up because

26:39.403 --> 26:42.046
we have learned to live with it, identified with it.

26:42.173 --> 26:46.667
We just cannot think of life without our ego, we just cannot.

26:47.905 --> 26:52.183
And it has gone to such an extent that we don’t even realize

26:52.336 --> 26:55.608
how far we have gone in cruelty.

26:56.350 --> 26:59.507
Like, “I like this kind, I like that kind.”

26:59.537 --> 27:01.790
You go to somebody’s house and you say like this.

27:01.859 --> 27:04.482
Is indecent to talk like that.

27:06.821 --> 27:11.165
It is vulgar to express, “I like.” Who are you?

27:11.776 --> 27:12.558
Are you God?

27:14.382 --> 27:16.618
I want this. I want that.

27:16.750 --> 27:20.258
I am very particular about this. I’m very, who are you?

27:22.270 --> 27:25.012
Just ask yourself a question, “Who am I?

27:26.642 --> 27:28.642
I’m the Spirit.

27:28.799 --> 27:31.049
I’m that eternal being.

27:31.619 --> 27:33.619
Have I become that?”

27:35.294 --> 27:39.716
On the contrary we are hurting everybody’s Spirit by our ego.

27:40.436 --> 27:44.861
Every moment when we talk to others we are hurting them.

27:45.125 --> 27:47.918
Actually people have lost faith in God,

27:48.703 --> 27:52.269
because those who are in charge of God are so arrogant

27:52.851 --> 27:55.595
and so egoistical

27:55.970 --> 27:59.894
that it has become impossible for anybody to think of God,

28:00.040 --> 28:02.040
which is beyond your ego.

28:03.157 --> 28:08.089
You’ll be surprised, ego is absolutely superficial like a bubble.

28:08.200 --> 28:10.127
It is just like a balloon,

28:10.217 --> 28:12.198
which can burst just like that.

28:13.029 --> 28:14.247
And it should go.

28:14.912 --> 28:18.140
It should go so that you should rise.

28:18.517 --> 28:24.616
It should disappear so that your attention rises in your Spirit.

28:24.963 --> 28:28.248
And that you see the whole world as a part

28:28.576 --> 28:31.131
of that Spirit that you are.

28:31.929 --> 28:34.613
This is the boundary, which you have to cross

28:34.707 --> 28:37.464
and for that we have to take help from Christ.

28:38.446 --> 28:41.939
Christ crucified himself. Why?

28:42.611 --> 28:43.757
Because what did He do?

28:45.679 --> 28:46.902
Did He loot people?

28:47.133 --> 28:50.862
Today you have thousands of these thugs coming here and looting you.

28:51.751 --> 28:54.428
Nobody crucifies them. What did He do?

28:56.191 --> 28:59.881
He just challenged the ego of these Romans

29:00.503 --> 29:05.103
and of these Jews, those who were angry with Him,

29:05.790 --> 29:08.159
and that’s why He was crucified.

29:10.849 --> 29:14.713
And we have to crucify our ego now through His cross.

29:16.525 --> 29:18.952
Otherwise we are going to do the same

29:19.612 --> 29:24.790
again to ourselves that in our own being

29:24.894 --> 29:28.324
we crucify our Christ by our ego.

29:28.808 --> 29:31.268
It is a very symbolic gesture of Christ,

29:32.109 --> 29:35.411
His birth in the most humble place,

29:35.765 --> 29:37.167
in a very humble place.

29:37.577 --> 29:41.091
He is born in the optic thalamus, you can say,

29:41.201 --> 29:44.635
is the place where there brain, all activities coming and

29:44.684 --> 29:49.616
all the, all sorts of problems there chasing you,

29:49.970 --> 29:54.901
and there He lives and you have to just awaken Him there

29:54.984 --> 29:59.140
so that your ego is crucified once for all.

30:00.367 --> 30:03.020
But I don’t think you fight your ego

30:03.203 --> 30:05.368
because it is not that important to fight.

30:05.458 --> 30:07.146
You are fighting with your shadow.

30:07.678 --> 30:10.310
You have shadow which is called as ego

30:10.848 --> 30:13.752
which is not to be fought and wasted you,

30:13.790 --> 30:16.604
to waste your energy on him. Just no need to fight,

30:16.874 --> 30:20.072
only thing if you stand in the center of the light

30:20.134 --> 30:21.396
you don’t see any shadow.

30:21.512 --> 30:23.104
It is so simple as that.

30:23.169 --> 30:26.784
If you stand in the center of light that is Christ

30:26.848 --> 30:29.014
you don’t see any shadow anywhere.

30:29.065 --> 30:32.193
But when I say this I may sound like other people who give sermons,

30:32.280 --> 30:36.379
“Stand in the shadow of Christ or stand in the light of Christ.”

30:36.449 --> 30:37.352
Now what does that mean?

30:38.698 --> 30:43.344
Where is that light or where is that place where you should stand?

30:43.830 --> 30:47.913
That place is here in the center of your

30:49.847 --> 30:53.497
optic thalamus where there is no thought.

30:54.304 --> 30:56.986
You have to stand in thoughtless awareness.

30:57.880 --> 31:00.888
Many people who have had a problem with Agnya,

31:01.252 --> 31:03.017
many people who have come

31:03.044 --> 31:04.894
[Talk is interrupted here and a few words are missing]

31:05.090 --> 31:07.510
…thoughts will stop and they will be beyond thought.

31:07.843 --> 31:11.587
And this a very, very important Chakra

31:11.630 --> 31:15.448
for Sahaja Yogis because when the Kundalini rises above,

31:16.348 --> 31:19.856
above the Agnya Chakra immediately there is no thought.

31:20.016 --> 31:24.575
You do not get any thoughts from ego or superego.

31:24.644 --> 31:30.452
But there is wobbling in the Agnya because of your imbalanced ways.

31:30.584 --> 31:32.075
And the imbalanced ways are,

31:32.160 --> 31:35.069
that sometimes you are with ego or with superego.

31:36.543 --> 31:39.239
This has happened to our people in the West

31:39.620 --> 31:43.280
because we have had so much of ego we got really tired of it.

31:44.174 --> 31:45.383
We got frightened with it.

31:45.759 --> 31:50.596
Then we started taking to drugs and things to increase our superego.

31:51.353 --> 31:53.067
But by doing that what we are doing is

31:53.132 --> 31:55.555
pushing by one end and bringing back another end

31:55.624 --> 31:57.285
and that’s how we are wobbling

31:57.360 --> 31:59.527
our ego and superego

31:59.724 --> 32:02.391
by which we are not helping ourselves at all.

32:02.986 --> 32:04.986
So what one has to do

32:05.106 --> 32:08.177
is to rise within oneself up to the point of Agnya

32:08.274 --> 32:10.292
and try to steady your Agnya.

32:10.841 --> 32:13.383
There are many people have asked Me one question.

32:13.401 --> 32:15.099
How to steady the Agnya?

32:17.129 --> 32:22.651
Agnya is placed at the crossing point of our nerves

32:22.800 --> 32:24.316
and also optic thalamus.

32:24.714 --> 32:27.485
Now, so it is said that

32:27.566 --> 32:30.492
if you have wobbling eyes you’ll have a wobbling Agnya.

32:31.276 --> 32:32.806
You have to steady your eyes.

32:33.629 --> 32:34.701
You have to soothe them.

32:34.921 --> 32:40.773
Now it is very, very out of date, ancient, old

32:40.865 --> 32:44.264
and all sorts of names that you call it to a thing like that.

32:44.320 --> 32:46.537
But you must steady your eyes and

32:46.629 --> 32:50.684
steady them in such a way that it is very soothing for the eyes.

32:51.212 --> 32:54.876
Which is the most soothing thing for the eyes is the green grass.

32:56.956 --> 33:01.378
If you could see the green grass with your eyes means you walk

33:02.366 --> 33:04.354
with your eyes on the ground.

33:05.416 --> 33:08.189
Your eyes will be soothed, your Agnya will be all right.

33:08.364 --> 33:10.203
That’s why Christ said that,

33:10.231 --> 33:13.504
“I tell you about the adulterous eyes”.

33:13.732 --> 33:15.801
He talked about adulterous eyes.

33:16.060 --> 33:18.803
The eyes with which you do adultery.

33:20.530 --> 33:22.032
Is a very common thing these days.

33:22.132 --> 33:23.933
Every woman a man must see.

33:23.991 --> 33:25.405
Every man a woman must see.

33:26.342 --> 33:28.409
As if it is the most important job.

33:28.446 --> 33:30.641
If you have not seen one woman you’re finished.

33:31.707 --> 33:33.108
I mean this is being modern.

33:33.437 --> 33:35.356
But I am an old fashioned lady.

33:35.706 --> 33:38.760
And at the time of Christ he said,

33:38.930 --> 33:40.868
“You should not have adulterous eyes.”

33:41.181 --> 33:43.787
And the ones who have adulterous eyes are,

33:44.568 --> 33:49.751
no more than any other, but our Western Christians.

33:51.135 --> 33:54.249
Who all the time even in the church, even

33:54.309 --> 33:57.444
when they’re giving sermons, their eyes are moving with adultery.

33:58.437 --> 34:03.644
These eyes have to be very, very pure, very, very deep

34:03.756 --> 34:08.559
and very loving when you want to have your Agnya all right.

34:08.672 --> 34:10.403
Because you receive through you eyes.

34:11.316 --> 34:12.916
Say if you have closed your eyes

34:13.055 --> 34:15.072
you do not put your attention to anything because

34:15.086 --> 34:16.032
your eyes are closed.

34:16.175 --> 34:18.583
You are not adding more thoughts to yourself.

34:18.872 --> 34:22.045
But if your eyes are open you are adding much more thoughts

34:22.220 --> 34:24.630
because everywhere the eyes go the attention goes

34:24.664 --> 34:27.521
and you see things and create thoughts and put in them.

34:27.597 --> 34:32.267
So your attention which has to go to the Spirit,

34:32.453 --> 34:34.103
which has to go to God,

34:34.401 --> 34:38.302
which has to shine through the window of Divine.

34:38.569 --> 34:41.958
This beautiful thing is ruined by

34:42.307 --> 34:46.082
the way we use our eyes and we do not respect it.

34:47.682 --> 34:54.682
There’s nothing so pure and beautiful as the grass on the ground

34:54.908 --> 34:57.987
or the ground itself, which takes our feet,

34:58.075 --> 35:02.178
which supports us, which looks after us, enriches us.

35:03.562 --> 35:05.937
We should put our eyes on the Mother Earth

35:06.035 --> 35:07.915
instead of looking at every person.

35:08.484 --> 35:11.437
But from Sahaja Yoga point of view now many of you know

35:11.441 --> 35:13.911
what happens to your eyes  when you look at somebody.

35:14.237 --> 35:18.270
Maybe a entity might enter your eyes.

35:18.689 --> 35:20.488
And it is, you’ll be amazed

35:20.849 --> 35:23.137
that it is the play of the entity

35:23.186 --> 35:25.390
what we call this so-called flirting is.

35:25.507 --> 35:28.603
I’ve talked about it before also and people didn’t like it

35:28.745 --> 35:30.213
when I told them about it.

35:30.888 --> 35:34.497
But I have seen actual entities entering from eyes to eyes.

35:36.164 --> 35:38.884
I have seen very simple people who come down

35:38.950 --> 35:41.272
to such places, say in a party.

35:41.784 --> 35:46.141
In a party people are just exchanging entities

35:46.211 --> 35:47.373
from one eye to another.

35:47.645 --> 35:49.162
Once it goes to another person

35:49.235 --> 35:51.010
he puts his entity into another person.

35:51.155 --> 35:52.758
And that third goes into another person.

35:53.045 --> 35:55.800
All the time your attention is diverted.

35:55.871 --> 35:58.806
And you feel it is attracted towards something,

35:59.150 --> 36:01.537
you do not know why it is attracted.

36:02.095 --> 36:04.433
Now the certain symbols are also made like that.

36:05.276 --> 36:06.847
To add up to the problems,

36:07.122 --> 36:09.872
you see all the society is working at it.

36:09.914 --> 36:11.543
That you should appear in such a way that

36:11.549 --> 36:12.757
every man should look at you.

36:15.608 --> 36:17.013
Every woman should look at you.

36:17.876 --> 36:19.575
Why? What is the use?

36:19.796 --> 36:21.931
Supposing I look at you what do I get?

36:23.198 --> 36:25.456
What do I get by looking at a person?

36:27.479 --> 36:30.247
What is the advantage just looking at a person?

36:30.370 --> 36:33.046
We are wasting such a lot of energy for what?

36:34.794 --> 36:37.164
In the same way if you are walking on the roads,

36:38.162 --> 36:41.589
we are seeing some beautiful things all right.

36:41.841 --> 36:43.579
If you have to buy something, all right go ahead,

36:43.608 --> 36:45.863
see those things, whatever you have to select is all right.

36:46.187 --> 36:50.005
But all the time just because your eyes are such,

36:50.029 --> 36:52.982
you are just doing it and you do not know the reason

36:53.197 --> 36:54.914
why you are doing like this,

36:54.954 --> 36:56.954
all the time why your eyes are wobbling.

36:58.926 --> 37:02.462
And that is a sure and certain sign for a person to become mad.

37:05.214 --> 37:08.420
Absolutely, that’s a sure and certain sign is,

37:08.474 --> 37:11.086
when a person is mad

37:11.444 --> 37:13.709
how do you make it out that a person is lunatic.

37:13.740 --> 37:18.809
If you see his eyes the iris in the eyes are all the time wobbling.

37:19.686 --> 37:21.267
They cannot keep it steady.

37:21.466 --> 37:24.634
Or they are sick they’re also, you can see,

37:24.841 --> 37:28.372
that these eyes are all the time wobbling.

37:28.401 --> 37:29.329
There is no steadiness.

37:29.944 --> 37:32.532
Not only this but you have seen those people who

37:32.559 --> 37:35.182
have come in the Sahaja Yoga when they close their eyes

37:35.339 --> 37:38.987
they find their eyes are flickering.

37:39.043 --> 37:40.501
Their eyelids are flickering.

37:40.661 --> 37:42.951
That means there is some sort of a disturbance

37:43.031 --> 37:44.338
in the Kundalini rising.

37:47.309 --> 37:51.072
Whole tension if you call it as hundred

37:51.246 --> 37:55.193
then at least eighty percent of it comes through our eyes.

37:57.897 --> 38:00.972
Then how important it is to protect our eyes

38:01.214 --> 38:04.508
from all kind of useless activities we are doing.

38:06.806 --> 38:13.806
Christ - Christ’s life shows so many aspects

38:14.146 --> 38:16.761
of how to respect others.

38:16.885 --> 38:20.661
But one of them which has been very much misused throughout is

38:20.718 --> 38:22.718
that of the prostitute.

38:24.837 --> 38:29.712
He saved the prostitute, He saved her no doubt.

38:30.122 --> 38:33.239
But you spoil these prostitutes.

38:34.841 --> 38:37.942
A good woman you make her into prostitutes.

38:38.379 --> 38:41.798
You give her ideas by which she becomes a prostitute.

38:42.107 --> 38:43.385
A good Huswife (old English word like housewife)

38:43.814 --> 38:47.226
is turned into a prostitute by an egotistical man.

38:47.887 --> 38:53.684
Young small girls who are virgins are being destroyed

38:54.004 --> 38:56.470
by your dirty glances.

38:56.655 --> 38:58.436
Do you realize this?

38:58.682 --> 39:01.711
That you are doing just the opposite what Christ had done?

39:01.827 --> 39:03.420
And you say that He saved, Christ,

39:03.628 --> 39:06.347
so even if we are prostitutes He’ll save us.

39:06.372 --> 39:07.809
But why be prostitutes?

39:08.340 --> 39:13.178
This is such a stupid style of thinking.

39:13.375 --> 39:16.039
That we should become prostitutes so that Christ will save us.

39:21.775 --> 39:25.821
One has to think about all these things

39:26.540 --> 39:28.712
in the proper light of Sahaja Yoga.

39:29.063 --> 39:30.605
Unless and until you are realized

39:30.739 --> 39:33.047
My talk is just useless for you.

39:33.781 --> 39:36.137
But once you are realized you will know

39:36.359 --> 39:38.555
that if you glance at someone

39:38.798 --> 39:41.422
you might suddenly get a headache at the back.

39:41.527 --> 39:44.534
You might feel a dart has gone into your head

39:44.552 --> 39:45.892
or something has happened.

39:45.992 --> 39:47.724
You might feel that you’re blinding

39:48.053 --> 39:53.024
with somebody’s face and you will get all kinds of experiences

39:53.054 --> 39:56.711
by which you will know how important are your eyes.

39:58.270 --> 40:01.405
All your nervousness and everything can be cured

40:01.699 --> 40:03.254
if you have pure eyes.

40:03.504 --> 40:05.039
But it is such a vicious circle

40:05.381 --> 40:07.645
that through your eyes you gather all the bad

40:07.734 --> 40:10.807
and is accumulated in the Agnya and you have to clear the Agnya

40:10.845 --> 40:12.296
to make the eyes clear.

40:13.143 --> 40:14.246
It’s a vicious circle.

40:14.733 --> 40:16.733
But it can start at a point as I said,

40:16.828 --> 40:18.302
we have to ask for forgiveness.

40:20.107 --> 40:27.079
Secondly we have to bring Christ in our Agnya Chakra.

40:29.482 --> 40:31.314
Thirdly we have to give up all

40:31.643 --> 40:35.724
drugs and all intoxicants and all smoking.

40:36.306 --> 40:39.576
That happens automatically when you are a Sahaja Yogi,

40:39.600 --> 40:40.454
it will work out.

40:40.753 --> 40:45.800
But eyes express the whole of your being, your brain,

40:46.072 --> 40:50.483
your body, your limbs everything.

40:50.616 --> 40:56.120
And if your Agnya is all right then you eyes

40:56.578 --> 40:58.220
are perfectly all right.

40:58.414 --> 41:00.797
They emit nothing but love

41:01.395 --> 41:02.830
wherever they glance.

41:03.130 --> 41:06.977
Only with a glance of your eyes you can raise the Kundalini.

41:08.091 --> 41:12.371
Only with the glance of your eyes you can cure people.

41:12.845 --> 41:16.659
Only with your glance you can bring joy into

41:16.702 --> 41:19.090
the destroyed and the ruined people.

41:19.524 --> 41:23.064
So these eyes which you see are the windows

41:23.081 --> 41:25.377
of your being, of your heart.

41:25.597 --> 41:30.122
When the Spirit is expressed through your eyes,

41:30.316 --> 41:32.214
you must have noticed yourself,

41:32.285 --> 41:36.212
that when the Kundalini rises then the eyes become dilated.

41:37.697 --> 41:39.697
And a realized soul has got

41:39.939 --> 41:46.550
black eyes because they have these eyes are dilated.

41:46.688 --> 41:49.852
At least when I see them they are all dilated black eyes.

41:50.604 --> 41:51.730
Apart from that

41:51.927 --> 41:55.520
a realized soul can be made out by his eyes which are sparkling.

41:55.918 --> 41:57.918
There’s a sparkle like diamonds.

41:58.142 --> 42:00.287
They sparkle all the time and

42:00.392 --> 42:01.792
you can make out from the eyes

42:01.827 --> 42:03.827
that this person is a realized soul.

42:04.070 --> 42:07.305
There’s a tremendous difference between a non-realized

42:07.457 --> 42:10.021
soul’s eyes and a realized soul’s eyes.

42:10.249 --> 42:15.658
So you can imagine how your Spirit sees through your eyes.

42:15.861 --> 42:19.672
But if the eyes are not pure it doesn’t stay there long.

42:20.039 --> 42:22.859
So if we have to understand Christ

42:22.897 --> 42:25.107
physically we have to respect our eyes.

42:25.410 --> 42:31.420
Mentally we have to give up all that is impure in our mind.

42:32.369 --> 42:35.734
Now, so we come to the impurities of the mind.

42:35.958 --> 42:38.539
And the impurities of mind are,

42:40.145 --> 42:42.483
there are so many poisons, you know, about.

42:42.677 --> 42:45.236
I mean there are books and books written about the poisons.

42:45.328 --> 42:48.501
And the psychologists are supposed to take out all your poisons.

42:48.715 --> 42:50.446
I don’t know if they can do it at all.

42:50.615 --> 42:51.983
But they have the worst Agnya.

42:52.205 --> 42:55.171
All these psychologists have the worst Agnya

42:55.300 --> 42:57.513
and I don’t think they are capable

42:57.609 --> 43:00.262
of really giving any relief to people

43:00.359 --> 43:02.598
who are suffering mentally.

43:03.084 --> 43:05.084
Mental sufferings are of two types.

43:05.855 --> 43:08.473
Say the same thing is that one is…

43:08.900 --> 43:15.900
MOTHER SAYS ASIDE: Vibrations are so much, I can’t stand it.

43:16.538 --> 43:23.370
One type of mental troubles are

43:23.489 --> 43:26.417
where people oppress you very much.

43:26.574 --> 43:30.370
You see you go on bearing the cross.

43:31.311 --> 43:35.129
Now this is a very wrong idea people have about Christ.

43:35.977 --> 43:39.534
Bearing the cross doesn’t mean that anybody who tries

43:39.726 --> 43:44.193
to oppress you should go on taking the enslavement upon yourself.

43:45.160 --> 43:48.954
You’re not to enslave to anyone whatsoever.

43:51.080 --> 43:52.455
Anybody who tries

43:52.560 --> 43:56.765
to make a slave out of you, you should deny it absolutely.

43:57.087 --> 43:59.087
You should say Ham, I am.

43:59.506 --> 44:01.180
Who are you to dominate me?

44:01.491 --> 44:02.322
Anyone

44:02.418 --> 44:05.758
whether you are of a black skin, or a red skin or a yellow skin,

44:05.838 --> 44:11.310
nobody has right to dominate anyone in this whole world.

44:11.810 --> 44:15.084
And if anybody is doing it, “Oh what to do now,

44:15.170 --> 44:17.520
after all you see we are poor people,

44:17.604 --> 44:20.579
or we are like this or he’s supporting,” and all that.

44:21.012 --> 44:25.292
Then they are running away from their duty towards themselves.

44:25.938 --> 44:27.770
Such people cannot get Realization.

44:28.879 --> 44:31.517
Slaves are not going to become kings.

44:34.041 --> 44:40.139
So the slavery that is supposed to be confused with bearing the cross

44:40.546 --> 44:44.467
is another confusion of modern times.

44:46.556 --> 44:48.760
We have to rise in our self-respect.

44:49.216 --> 44:50.650
And we have to understand

44:50.770 --> 44:55.050
that no one in this world has a right to dominate us.

44:56.176 --> 44:59.506
But then what is bearing of the cross is?

45:00.389 --> 45:04.319
First of all the people of His level never suffer.

45:04.892 --> 45:06.259
It’s just a joke going on.

45:06.294 --> 45:08.667
It’s a Leela, it’s a play going on for them.

45:08.906 --> 45:10.346
They never suffer,

45:13.875 --> 45:18.087
and even if they so called act as suffering

45:19.965 --> 45:22.472
they just do it because they want to do it.

45:23.754 --> 45:25.754
They are not helpless people.

45:26.887 --> 45:28.203
They are not slaves.

45:29.650 --> 45:34.025
And those who think that by bearing it up and by suffering it

45:35.303 --> 45:36.840
we are becoming Christians

45:36.979 --> 45:39.152
they should know they are psychological cases.

45:41.948 --> 45:45.253
And if they are crying and weeping and all the time saying,

45:45.355 --> 45:50.109
“What to do, you see I am in love and my lover tortures me.”

45:50.510 --> 45:53.536
You are neither in love neither you have a lover.

45:54.261 --> 45:56.900
It is a kind of a psychological clubbing.

45:57.104 --> 45:58.895
That he is a dominating man

45:58.951 --> 46:01.424
and you like his domination, that’s why you are together.

46:01.560 --> 46:02.909
Is a simple fact.

46:06.154 --> 46:13.152
So every human being has his own self-respect.

46:13.415 --> 46:17.994
And he must respect his self that is the Spirit within him.

46:18.035 --> 46:19.252
And nothing should dominate it.

46:19.354 --> 46:20.332
Whether you belong to this country or that country,

46:20.519 --> 46:21.198
or this ism or that ism. All this will break down.

46:21.226 --> 46:23.099
Under the rule of God

46:23.888 --> 46:27.105
nobody has the right to dominate anybody’s Spirit.

46:30.657 --> 46:32.507
But when you are given freedom

46:32.543 --> 46:35.227
you go to the other side that is Mr. Ego.

46:36.761 --> 46:38.991
You do not know how to use your freedom.

46:40.423 --> 46:42.423
So you try to dominate others.

46:44.006 --> 46:46.952
Your freedom is, everybody’s freedom is in danger.

46:47.317 --> 46:50.919
You’re on top of everyone, and torturing everybody’s souls.

46:50.977 --> 46:53.934
And you are dominating by land

46:54.073 --> 46:59.240
and by properties or by possessions.

47:03.903 --> 47:06.314
So either this way or that way,

47:06.728 --> 47:10.768
mentally if you are of this category or that category,

47:11.453 --> 47:13.167
you are against yourself.

47:15.048 --> 47:17.958
Just be in the center and see for yourself.

47:19.309 --> 47:21.566
Just be looking at it.

47:22.680 --> 47:26.906
Are you emitting love towards another person?

47:27.126 --> 47:31.632
If you are a slave how can you love? You cannot.

47:34.683 --> 47:42.727
If you are free and abandoned how can you love?

47:44.759 --> 47:49.353
Love has its own bondages very sweet and beautiful.

47:50.149 --> 47:52.149
You have to live with them.

47:53.946 --> 47:55.450
You enjoy those bondages.

47:56.251 --> 47:58.339
For a little child will come to your house

47:58.359 --> 48:01.707
and he will spoil your house no doubt, and that he should do.

48:03.081 --> 48:05.137
And you should enjoy that spoiling.

48:07.638 --> 48:11.721
Then your freedom if it is challenged by a little child’s crying,

48:11.870 --> 48:14.213
then you are not wise people.

48:15.507 --> 48:16.971
This is abandonment.

48:18.782 --> 48:21.001
Or I would say it is loneliness.

48:21.069 --> 48:27.145
It is cutting off from the primordial, from the big one,

48:28.148 --> 48:30.144
from the large one that you are.

48:31.128 --> 48:36.634
Is not to be able to tolerate the freedom of others.

48:36.761 --> 48:39.108
A child has no freedom to cry in the house.

48:40.339 --> 48:43.769
What sort of freedom you conceive of.

48:44.920 --> 48:47.084
A mother has no right to say

48:47.115 --> 48:49.042
something she wants to say about her child,

48:49.062 --> 48:51.539
which is her duty to tell him what is right and wrong.

48:52.455 --> 48:54.308
If the son does not have right

48:54.462 --> 48:57.147
to eat whatever he likes in his own mother’s family

48:57.404 --> 48:59.285
then what sort of freedom do you have?

48:59.293 --> 49:01.178
It’s such a confusion of things.

49:04.261 --> 49:06.094
So this kind of freedom

49:06.605 --> 49:10.100
is just the opposite and extreme of enslavement.

49:10.323 --> 49:14.500
But in the center is love where you are bound by everyone.

49:15.027 --> 49:18.419
I am bound by My children. Yes, I am.

49:19.045 --> 49:20.033
I am proud of them.

49:20.525 --> 49:24.019
They bound Me and I bound them too.

49:24.911 --> 49:28.348
It’s a mutual bounding which we enjoy among ourselves.

49:30.756 --> 49:34.368
There is such a give and take when there is such a bondage of love.

49:37.440 --> 49:40.378
But do we understand the importance of bondage of love?

49:41.205 --> 49:43.205
At the slightest pretext we break it.

49:44.020 --> 49:46.770
Say wife says, “I would like to go out today”.

49:47.037 --> 49:48.074
The husband says “Why?

49:48.374 --> 49:49.945
I am very tired don’t you understand?“

49:51.541 --> 49:54.990
Or if the husband says, “I feel like eating something,”

49:55.027 --> 49:57.768
or some particular thing he says pancake or something,

49:58.043 --> 49:59.145
a small thing.

49:59.218 --> 50:01.286
“Oh I am very tired every time you are demanding.”

50:01.565 --> 50:04.473
If she could just think by making that little thing

50:04.539 --> 50:05.856
he would be so very happy.

50:05.873 --> 50:08.840
She should be dying to know what he wants.

50:08.875 --> 50:10.987
And he should be dying to do what she wants.

50:11.023 --> 50:13.185
And then enjoy each other’s company

50:13.238 --> 50:17.480
or you are wasting all your properties that you have as human beings.

50:18.610 --> 50:21.610
You don’t know how much you are wasting from each other.

50:23.309 --> 50:27.725
Every moment is filled with such beautiful bondages,

50:28.343 --> 50:31.204
where exchanges are there. What have you gained?

50:32.468 --> 50:34.468
The way you are fighting.

50:34.539 --> 50:36.126
The way you are going about.

50:36.220 --> 50:38.111
What have you gained let me see?

50:39.549 --> 50:41.620
When you die you have to announce in the paper

50:41.753 --> 50:44.564
that XYZ is dead and you find there is nobody.

50:44.594 --> 50:48.004
And you have even to pay for people to visit you when you die.

50:49.673 --> 50:51.123
This is the case today.

50:52.386 --> 50:56.553
Such dryness, such emptiness, such loneliness exists.

50:57.130 --> 50:58.905
What have you achieved through this.

51:00.906 --> 51:04.099
So this bondage we have to.

51:04.328 --> 51:07.233
And there is no question of sacrifice you see, the way.

51:07.264 --> 51:10.353
We must sacrifice for the family. What are you sacrificing?

51:12.407 --> 51:14.757
I mean if you pay for your family

51:14.897 --> 51:17.474
you get the joy out of it. That’s why you do it.

51:19.722 --> 51:22.770
If you have to lead a nice good life

51:23.596 --> 51:25.898
you are not sacrificing anything

51:26.278 --> 51:30.063
but you are gaining by that, leading a good life.

51:32.176 --> 51:34.694
If your wife says, “Don’t go to the pub,”

51:34.960 --> 51:36.870
and if you do not go there,

51:37.206 --> 51:40.056
then you should not say she is an orthodox,

51:40.101 --> 51:42.864
old fashioned this that, that and that and that.

51:42.910 --> 51:45.216
But instead you should thank you stars that

51:45.226 --> 51:47.273
in this modern times also that there is somebody

51:47.286 --> 51:48.468
who’s telling you the truth.

51:51.185 --> 51:53.628
Because the whole edifice has come up,

51:53.903 --> 51:56.740
do you mean to say that truth should not be told?

51:58.264 --> 52:01.314
All this is falsehood in which you are living.

52:01.420 --> 52:04.599
And if you have to be happy come down to reality.

52:08.215 --> 52:09.848
Friends, also same thing.

52:10.263 --> 52:13.618
With the friends what sort of relations do we have with our friends?

52:14.043 --> 52:15.522
What do we expect from them?

52:15.823 --> 52:17.360
Sending them a Christmas card

52:19.277 --> 52:21.571
and then if they don’t send, feeling bad about it.

52:26.171 --> 52:29.629
There are no deeper bondages we have not lived with them.

52:29.679 --> 52:32.681
If you allow our self to be bound by them,

52:32.916 --> 52:34.916
they will be bound by us.

52:35.913 --> 52:37.913
You better try this.

52:38.219 --> 52:41.761
Try to be bound by them. Don’t be afraid of anybody else.

52:42.137 --> 52:44.463
Just try to be bound by others

52:44.707 --> 52:47.432
and you’ll be amazed how much they will be giving you.

52:47.617 --> 52:49.617
I am a living example of this.

52:53.109 --> 52:55.691
I can tell you I am a living example of this.

52:55.720 --> 52:57.222
I am bound by all of you.

52:58.474 --> 53:01.952
If somebody says, “Mother when are you going to leave us?”

53:02.113 --> 53:05.131
No I cannot. I cannot. I am just bound by you. I just

53:05.228 --> 53:07.988
do not want to leave because I love you very much.

53:08.105 --> 53:10.105
How can I leave you?

53:11.020 --> 53:12.316
It’s impossible for Me.

53:13.356 --> 53:15.731
So then, what do I gain out of this life?

53:15.791 --> 53:19.550
Everything that is in this world.

53:20.139 --> 53:21.572
What do you want Me to get?

53:22.273 --> 53:24.869
I cannot even count what I can get out of it.

53:26.278 --> 53:28.603
Immeasurable, ocean.

53:30.226 --> 53:32.632
I become an ocean Myself.

53:33.981 --> 53:38.647
Break your ideas about your own personal

53:38.767 --> 53:43.514
freedom and liberation, is liberating your intelligence.

53:45.933 --> 53:49.299
You‘re liberating your own wisdom.

53:51.578 --> 53:58.177
And the sweetness and the beauty which is never perishable

53:58.410 --> 54:00.410
whether you are old or young.

54:01.519 --> 54:03.770
That is going to be your own.

54:05.649 --> 54:09.475
But these poisons that are being built outside and inside you,

54:09.604 --> 54:10.870
please throw them away.

54:11.043 --> 54:15.370
These are mental poisons.

54:16.507 --> 54:18.752
Through Agnya you can take them out.

54:19.408 --> 54:22.215
You see, this is an opening also

54:22.326 --> 54:24.326
through which  many things go out.

54:26.818 --> 54:28.299
Try to work it out.

54:28.685 --> 54:32.698
Look at the tree with love

54:34.235 --> 54:36.515
and you’ll find that the tree itself

54:36.531 --> 54:38.925
is giving you the joy of its creation.

54:39.238 --> 54:40.994
Because you’ll become thoughtless.

54:41.568 --> 54:44.979
And the creator who has made that beautiful tree

54:45.027 --> 54:48.310
will be pouring all that joy which is stored into it into you.

54:49.519 --> 54:52.384
Every human being is a store of joy.

54:53.786 --> 54:58.178
Unlimited, I assure you, believe Me.

54:59.102 --> 55:04.404
And don’t waste them because somebody is not properly dressed,

55:05.510 --> 55:07.830
or he’s not according to the way

55:07.917 --> 55:11.252
you want him to be which you learnt in your public school.

55:13.572 --> 55:19.495
Every doorstep, everywhere there is beauty lying, do not miss it.

55:20.365 --> 55:25.917
But if you have possessiveness about it, an adultery about it,

55:28.558 --> 55:30.535
then you can never enjoy them.

55:33.532 --> 55:39.694
You can never enjoy all that beauty, all that store, all that wealth

55:40.505 --> 55:45.755
that is in every human being every moment it is bubbling.

55:47.228 --> 55:51.947
For Agnya it’s a good thing, Christmas is coming.

55:52.019 --> 55:54.955
And at the time that when I have to wish you Happy Christmas,

55:56.813 --> 56:02.152
that at this occasion I am speaking about Agnya Chakra

56:02.555 --> 56:06.292
in which, what I said is, Agnya is

56:06.664 --> 56:09.829
one must know what to order and how to obey.

56:10.941 --> 56:12.436
Obey the Divine.

56:13.311 --> 56:14.870
Obey your elders.

56:16.878 --> 56:20.772
Obey your self and not your ego.

56:22.581 --> 56:25.566
And then you can order also others.

56:27.025 --> 56:29.041
Not only human beings,

56:29.076 --> 56:31.886
but you can even order the sun and the moon and

56:31.919 --> 56:33.919
all the winds and everything in the world.

56:35.657 --> 56:39.397
Everything you can control, everything with this Agnya.

56:40.127 --> 56:41.434
You try one thing.

56:42.186 --> 56:44.715
If you know somebody is going to do something wrong,

56:44.875 --> 56:50.715
just take his name and put it to Agnya. He’ll not do it, try it.

56:52.460 --> 56:54.144
This is a trick I’m telling about

56:54.802 --> 56:56.442
for those who are realized souls

56:56.469 --> 56:58.091
not for those who are not yet realized

56:58.108 --> 56:59.762
but those who are realized can try.

57:00.881 --> 57:02.881
If the other person is doing something wrong

57:02.925 --> 57:04.357
you can try your Agnya.

57:04.626 --> 57:07.441
Anything you order on your Agnya will be respected

57:07.965 --> 57:09.965
but your Agnya must have Christ there.

57:11.138 --> 57:17.211
Because you have the great support awakened within you,

57:17.420 --> 57:21.613
which does not exist here but into every man’s head.

57:23.503 --> 57:28.301
It is all pervading into all small atoms and molecules, it is

57:28.397 --> 57:32.681
everywhere into the sun and any place you go. It is there.

57:35.948 --> 57:42.330
So try to develop your Agnya that is the mastery of your self.

57:43.287 --> 57:46.563
Those who have a good Agnya can master anything

57:47.071 --> 57:51.950
and understand that the idea about mastering

57:52.004 --> 57:55.232
worldly things and mastering human beings and mastering this

57:55.344 --> 58:00.022
and some of them are mastering in, say, other crafts and things,

58:00.304 --> 58:02.304
best thing is to master your Agnya.

58:03.360 --> 58:07.437
And you really become the master of yourself

58:07.889 --> 58:10.316
by which you can master many things.

58:10.850 --> 58:13.699
And today on this great day

58:13.964 --> 58:17.778
when I’m wishing you a Happy Christmas, I wish you to have

58:19.002 --> 58:22.563
the most powerful Agnyas,

58:22.762 --> 58:24.762
that people when they see your forehead

58:24.891 --> 58:28.483
should know that Christ is reborn again with in you.

58:28.826 --> 58:29.871
May God bless you.
