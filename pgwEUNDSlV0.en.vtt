WEBVTT

03:19.702 --> 03:35.842
Today is the second day of our new journey into
the battlefield. We have to win people with

03:35.952 --> 03:46.326
love, compassion, affection and dignity.
When we say it’s a Vishwa Dharma, it’s

03:46.722 --> 04:01.113
a Universal Religion we belong to, first and
foremost thing, the essence of that, is peace.

04:01.291 --> 04:11.097
The peace has to be within, to begin with.
You have to be peaceful within yourself. If

04:11.112 --> 04:23.082
you are not peaceful, if you are playing tricks
with your ego, if you are just satisfying

04:23.272 --> 04:29.112
yourself saying that you are peaceful, you
are sadly mistaken.

04:29.112 --> 04:40.562
Peace is to be enjoyed within yourself. It
is to be felt within yourself. So do not give

04:40.682 --> 04:51.911
wrong satisfactions to yourself, do not give
false notions to yourself. Don’t cheat yourself.

04:52.902 --> 04:58.242
Peace has to be felt within yourself, and
if you are not feeling that, you shouldn’t

04:58.242 --> 05:02.922
come and ask me, “Mother, why I am not feeling
it.” Because I am not going to tell you

05:02.922 --> 05:12.752
that something [is] wrong with you. You have
to work it out that you should feel peaceful

05:12.722 --> 05:20.152
within yourself.
It is not that if you have too much of silence

05:20.152 --> 05:30.366
outside, you feel peaceful. The peace has
to be within yourself. You have it. Your Spirit

05:30.612 --> 05:38.536
is absolutely peaceful – Avyagra, without
restlessness. There is no restlessness in

05:38.552 --> 05:48.267
your Spirit. Absolutely peaceful and steady.
It is for you to feel it. It is not for anybody

05:48.332 --> 05:53.281
else to certify you. This is one thing. Secondly,
when I am telling you something, you think

05:53.281 --> 05:57.982
I am not telling you. It doesn’t register
in your brain. You think I am telling it to

05:57.982 --> 06:04.982
X, Y, Z but not to you. You are not in it.
That’s another sign [that] there is no peace.

06:05.012 --> 06:12.012
Because there is no peace, there is no registration.
Whatever goes into your head, that is going

06:13.811 --> 06:17.412
to work out.
But what I find [is] that people [who] have

06:17.412 --> 06:29.242
concave personalities, then they receive it.
Those who have convex personalities, do not

06:29.311 --> 06:36.311
register anything . The registration is so
poor that, whatever I say doesn’t have any

06:36.632 --> 06:41.102
effect on them. Otherwise, whatever I say
is a mantra. It should have direct effect

06:41.102 --> 06:50.294
on you, and you should feel that effect, that
penetration within you. But as if it is for

06:50.382 --> 07:06.385
somebody else, as if it is not for you. This
shows there is no peace within you.

07:08.221 --> 07:19.747
Only the peace within can register whatever
is auspicious, whatever is nourishing for

07:19.982 --> 07:30.467
your growth. So try to make peace with yourself.
Do not fight with yourself, “Why should

07:30.572 --> 07:33.892
I do it?”, “I am so bad!”, “I should
not have done it!” – all these we should

07:33.892 --> 07:40.721
not do. Try not to fight with yourself, first
of all.

07:40.721 --> 07:44.971
Then you fight with me, “Why am I like this?
Why should it be like this with me? Why is

07:44.971 --> 07:50.202
it I catch? Why. . . .?.” How am I to answer
such a question? It is very aggressive. I

07:50.202 --> 07:54.462
think it is very aggressive attitude of many
Sahaja Yogis to come and ask me such a question,

07:54.462 --> 08:02.852
“Why…?” Because I can’t tell you what
is wrong with you because it is not in my

08:02.952 --> 08:08.031
culture. You should find yourself what is
wrong with you . But it’s not “what’s

08:08.031 --> 08:15.031
wrong with you” is the problem. What is
right with you is the attitude. Whatever is

08:15.432 --> 08:22.912
right with you, put your foot on that, establish
yourself on that point. And then develop yourself

08:23.132 --> 08:33.812
higher.
Peace is the keynote, as I said, for universal

08:33.941 --> 08:41.152
growth of this Religion.
It is disturbed by many things. Firstly, as

08:41.302 --> 08:48.302
I said, by yourself. You shouldn’t have
funny ideas about yourself. People have very

08:48.592 --> 08:54.802
funny ideas. I see Sahaja Yogis, as soon as
they get realisation, or something better

08:54.802 --> 08:59.641
happens to them, they start telling others
how to do meditation, how to stand up, how

08:59.641 --> 09:06.641
to give bandhan, how to do this and that.
It’s very very poor, is very low level.

09:07.222 --> 09:19.766
Try to assimilate within yourself. First grow
yourself That growth itself, will tell others

09:20.581 --> 09:27.222
how one should be. Your own character, your
own temperament, your own nature, your own

09:27.222 --> 09:32.882
behaviour. All this will tell others that
this is a great man and they will try to follow

09:32.882 --> 09:39.242
your example. Example is the best teaching.
When the tree is small, even if he says “I

09:39.242 --> 09:46.242
am great,” nobody is going to sit under
a dwarf tree! But when it is a big tree you

09:46.272 --> 09:51.902
can see the shade and everybody knows it’s
a big tree and they can come and sit under

09:51.902 --> 10:00.659
that. You don’t have to tell. In the same
way, when you grow, you don’t have to certify

10:00.799 --> 10:14.220
that “I am great”, it just works.
Now the peace within expresses, first of all,

10:14.872 --> 10:23.891
[as] peace with others. That is the first
sign of manifestation of peace. Such a person

10:24.122 --> 10:34.332
doesn’t use harsh words, doesn’t use cruel
words. But he’s also not a person who is

10:34.542 --> 10:43.596
ineffective. He’s very effective, using
very sweet and nice words. Maybe he begins

10:43.682 --> 10:49.802
by using harsh words, then he mellows down
and comes down to a position where he is effective

10:49.802 --> 11:01.486
as well as he is very mild and sweet.
Such a personality has to be developed – outside.

11:01.682 --> 11:09.653
So, peace with your friends, peace with Sahaja
Yogis. If you cannot be peaceful with Sahaja

11:09.862 --> 11:19.403
Yogis then you are no good. Absolutely no
good. When you meet another Sahaja Yogi you

11:19.662 --> 11:29.096
can’t bark like dogs at each other, can
you? You leave three Sahaja Yogis together,

11:29.442 --> 11:33.641
you end up with a big barking system. They
can’t manage within themselves. If there

11:33.641 --> 11:42.277
are hundred, then it’s alright. But you
can’t leave three and four here and there.

11:42.522 --> 11:53.170
So the peace should be with your brothers
and sisters. They are all born out of My Sahasrara

11:53.282 --> 12:04.306
and nobody has the right to insult, to be
sarcastic. Saying things which are harmful.

12:06.540 --> 12:11.982
That’s no friendship, that’s no friendship.
It is a kind of a very subtle enmity that

12:12.002 --> 12:22.104
you are carrying on in your hearts. That cannot
be forgiveness. If you say sarcastic things

12:22.372 --> 12:35.584
to others, you are not in the culture of Universal
Religion. You should be respectful. The more

12:35.761 --> 12:43.784
respectable you are to each other, the better
it would be.

12:43.894 --> 12:50.574
I don’t know how to tell you this. But say,
there is a Sahaja Yogi, you shouldn’t call

12:50.574 --> 12:59.981
him like as you would call any Tom Dick and
Harry. Like there’s someone going. “Eh

13:00.314 --> 13:12.182
Mr. X, come here!” Now people don’t even
say Mister. Please try to use their surnames

13:12.294 --> 13:21.102
would be better. Mr. So, Mr. So Mr. So. .Would
be better.

13:21.385 --> 13:25.945
Because this modern style of not using the
surname has brought down the respect for each

13:25.945 --> 13:32.555
other. But I think, Sahaja Yogis should try
a new method and suggest to Me even better

13:32.555 --> 13:41.962
methods, how to address each other, in such
a way that you respect others. That respect

13:42.145 --> 13:50.282
will create that peace within each other.
Suddenly you come out with remarks. Very nasty

13:50.435 --> 13:55.885
remarks they are. There’s no sense in it.
That’s not our culture. We belong to Universal

13:55.885 --> 14:09.878
Religion, how can it be that culture?
So, when you try to be peaceful with your

14:09.974 --> 14:18.616
brothers and sisters, try to be extremely
respectful. When you write letters to each

14:18.735 --> 14:23.875
other, you say “My dear brother in Sahaja
Yoga Such and Such.” I have seen all communists

14:23.875 --> 14:32.427
do that. Any body who belongs to any party
does that. It’s a kind of a respect they

14:32.414 --> 14:49.328
have. You can’t talk like street people
and ordinary people because you are really

14:49.715 --> 14:59.959
extraordinary, and all that is extraordinary
has to be expressed through you.

15:00.145 --> 15:13.671
As I am talking to you of this new culture,
let us understand how in many nations, people

15:13.724 --> 15:24.104
have adopted cultures and cultures. Japan,
I know, has been affected, very much, by modernisation.

15:24.245 --> 15:31.245
But Zen taught them certain kind of culture
in which, supposing, you see two Japanese

15:31.525 --> 15:37.425
have a car and they break each other’s car,
then they don’t say anything. They come

15:37.425 --> 15:41.575
out of their car, one will bow to another,
the another will bow to another, and get into

15:41.575 --> 15:46.354
the car and get out.
Then if they have to claim something, they’ll

15:46.354 --> 15:52.315
go to the courts, but there they don’t fight,
because what is the need? And I asked Japanese,

15:52.315 --> 15:56.495
“How do you manage it?” So they said,
“But what is the need to fight there on

15:56.495 --> 16:00.585
the street? Because after all, if it is to
be paid, it’s the insurance that is going

16:00.585 --> 16:07.034
to pay. If the car is broken, alright they
are going to pay us. Why to shout at him?”

16:07.034 --> 16:13.414
It’s very sensible and practical, I think.
Why to waste your breath for nothing at all?

16:13.414 --> 16:17.275
You are not going to get anything.
But I have known people who drive, and they

16:17.275 --> 16:22.964
are abusing every person who comes across
on their driving. I mean, really it’s curse

16:22.964 --> 16:30.187
of life, the way some people drive! And the
same way they drive in their own lives. All

16:30.625 --> 16:35.294
the time cursing this, “That one is like
this, this one is bad, that one is doing like

16:35.294 --> 16:40.555
that”. Even in Sahaja Yoga. They think they
have a right to criticize each and every person

16:40.555 --> 16:45.325
except for themselves.
So to keep this peace with others, be on an

16:45.325 --> 16:51.755
apologetic mood. “I hope I haven’t done
this mistake.” “I hope I haven’t hurt

16:51.755 --> 17:01.734
you.” “I hope I haven’t put your things
in a wrong way.” Like that. Be on an apologetic

17:01.854 --> 17:05.464
mood.
You can find that among Indians. Indians have

17:05.464 --> 17:10.865
that kind of a problem, they are more on apologetic
mood. Sometimes, it is impossible to convince

17:10.865 --> 17:20.439
them. I will give you an example. We went
down to Sangli, and you were so full in the

17:20.735 --> 17:26.784
morning and the food was not ready. So they
said that “We cannot have our food because

17:26.784 --> 17:33.624
it is late now and it will be later, so better
we sleep off.” They felt very hurt, you

17:33.624 --> 17:40.544
know. They thought that it was their mistake.
Now, it is registered that we haven’t given

17:40.544 --> 17:46.174
food to them, it is a horrid thing we have
done. And then I had to convince them that

17:46.174 --> 17:49.884
they are no way hurt, they are happy that
they are not eating, they have too much of

17:49.884 --> 17:54.804
food. “No, but still it will be registered
in our name that we didn’t offer them food

17:54.804 --> 18:00.865
and they slept without any food.” It was
impossible to convince them till the end,

18:00.865 --> 18:06.345
they were all the time feeling apologetic.
You see in Indian culture, we have something

18:06.345 --> 18:12.054
very great, as Japanese, as I told you, that
we are more on the apologetic style. Never

18:12.054 --> 18:18.394
on the aggressive. Never trying to find faults
with others, but we find faults in what way

18:18.394 --> 18:28.318
we have failed, how we have failed. This is
something to be learned from Indians, if they

18:28.784 --> 18:38.568
have retained their culture at all. It’s
actually in their blood.

18:42.624 --> 18:50.141
So that is how, our culture is going to be
such that we will express complete peace within

18:50.494 --> 18:56.855
ourselves. And you must know that you are
in one body, active. You are active cells

18:56.855 --> 19:01.855
in one body. All the cells of the body are
never active. But those who are active have

19:01.855 --> 19:09.368
to be at peace with each other, otherwise,
what will happen to that poor body? So try

19:09.835 --> 19:14.835
to make peace.
The second thing you can do to make peace

19:14.835 --> 19:21.835
is to talk less. Whenever there is a quarrel
or anything, just keep quiet. You see, it

19:22.524 --> 19:27.355
will have better effect. If two persons are
quarrelling, never try to solve it, but just

19:27.355 --> 19:34.843
keep quiet. Quiet is very important. More
to be silent. But it should not be another

19:35.664 --> 19:42.664
extreme like English culture, that they just
don’t talk, whatever it is. They don’t

19:42.744 --> 19:53.678
talk, but, they think too much. You must keep
quiet with the feeling that ‘May God bless

19:53.824 --> 20:12.375
these people some sense.”
It should not be ice frozen sea, but peace
which is effective. Peace that is effective.

20:12.494 --> 20:19.494
So in this new culture, we have to be extremely
peaceful people. And that peace should be

20:19.735 --> 20:31.926
expressed on your faces. People should understand
that you are peaceful. That’s why I say,

20:32.205 --> 20:35.985
if you are neatly dressed, your hair are neatly
put, people will feel alright. Otherwise if

20:35.985 --> 20:42.124
you reach some person with dishevelled hair,
you know he gets disturbed as it is! “God

20:42.124 --> 20:47.725
knows what has happened? From which quarrel
this man is coming? Somebody must have pulled

20:47.725 --> 20:55.989
his hair, or must have something gone wrong
with him, that the way he is dishevelled.”

20:57.585 --> 21:02.054
So if you are neatly dressed, people are not
put off so much, because they think that “No,

21:02.054 --> 21:06.424
no, this cannot be, because, you see, after
all, he never had a quarrel. He’s just coming

21:06.424 --> 21:13.424
peacefully from his house.”
In our culture, neatness in very important.

21:13.585 --> 21:25.012
Neatness of thought, neatness of mind, neatness
of body, neatness of behaviour. How you do

21:25.465 --> 21:32.465
things neatly is very important in our culture.
That’s very, very important! Which may look

21:32.614 --> 21:38.605
very funny to some people. Because, whether
you hold the fork this way or that way makes

21:38.605 --> 21:46.914
no difference to Me. It doesn’t matter how
you hold your fork or knife on a table. That’s

21:47.225 --> 21:50.994
not so important.
But it’s definitely it’s important how

21:51.734 --> 22:03.905
you hold the Aarti, how you hold the Puja
things, how you hold my photographs. How you

22:04.024 --> 22:09.274
hold the things that belong to other Sahaja
Yogis, how you respect the things that are

22:09.274 --> 22:20.086
auspicious.
So that is what one has to have within yourself.

22:20.335 --> 22:29.167
The neatness, of piousness, of auspiciousness,
of holiness. That is to be done with very

22:29.355 --> 22:35.944
great care and understanding, and with that
weight of auspiciousness you should walk.

22:35.944 --> 22:46.090
With that weight of auspiciousness. You are
auspiciousness walking on this earth, yourself.

22:46.644 --> 23:00.801
You are peace on this earth. But the way peace
is put into this vessel has to be clean, has

23:00.814 --> 23:09.147
to be neat and has to be placed in such a
way that nothing spills out.

23:12.574 --> 23:19.574
So to have peace, the best way to put your
mind right, is to think of good things. Think

23:20.725 --> 23:27.725
of the flowers, not of the thorns. What good
things others have done to you. What good

23:27.904 --> 23:36.709
things there are. What are the beautiful moments
you have had, and count your blessings. Count

23:36.794 --> 23:42.364
your blessings. Otherwise you cannot create
peace.

23:42.364 --> 23:57.573
[Mother tells someone off in Marathi]
You need not pay attention to everything like

23:57.595 --> 24:09.198
that. Keep your attention at peace. Keep the
peace inside, with your attention inside.

24:16.942 --> 24:26.659
Actually, if you really allow all my words
to go inside your brain, I’m sure I’ll

24:26.715 --> 24:33.715
achieve the results but with a convex mind,
it’s very difficult. Just suck in!

24:40.904 --> 24:55.071
The another aspect of peace is never try to
support anything that is boisterous or which

24:55.164 --> 25:04.702
is destructive. Anything that is destructive
is never to be supported. But anybody who

25:04.784 --> 25:21.396
is being tortured or aggressed or dominated,
is to be protected and supported. If you have

25:21.434 --> 25:30.106
the strength of peace, you can do it just
by standing there. You don’t have to fight

25:30.254 --> 25:40.807
for your peace. But if it comes to that…
A person like Hitler when he came, people

25:40.914 --> 25:55.407
had to fight for their peace.
Now, the second part of our culture has to

25:55.624 --> 26:04.508
be Bliss. People should see bliss working
in us. People should feel there is bliss.

26:04.614 --> 26:18.670
If a person is blissful, he looks blissful.
He emits, bliss. He radiates it. He doesn’t

26:18.884 --> 26:31.413
look a miserable, unhappy creature, who is
all the time grudging, grumbling or worried

26:31.475 --> 26:42.288
about little petty things here and there.
And nobody has the right to disturb anybody’s

26:42.475 --> 26:50.628
bliss. [If] somebody is in a blissful state,
try to copy that person and become that. But

26:50.694 --> 26:56.345
people get jealous of such people who are
blissful and try to disturb! That’s why

26:56.345 --> 27:01.944
so many saints were tortured, because they
were so blissful and happy people.

27:01.944 --> 27:11.772
We have to enjoy our bliss within, that is
important. Perhaps you are not aware of the

27:11.975 --> 27:26.793
bliss that you have. Not at all aware. Never,
never before there were so many people who

27:26.804 --> 27:32.624
got realisation. Never before, in the history,
that Adi Shakti Herself came on this earth

27:32.624 --> 27:48.296
to solve your problems. Never before, that
people of very ordinary effort, of very little

27:48.394 --> 28:00.885
seeking, of very little understanding have
been given realisation like this. It’s like,

28:00.975 --> 28:09.885
sometimes, if you see, like a stone becoming
a diamond suddenly. You can cut a diamond

28:10.095 --> 28:17.708
from a diamond.
Such blissful state you are in. It’s tremendous

28:17.794 --> 28:29.162
bliss has come. It’s so effective. I myself
don’t know when I see them. I’m really

28:29.284 --> 28:37.583
surprised how it is working.
Bliss can only come through gratitude. Only

28:37.876 --> 28:48.468
through enlarging your heart with gratitude.
Bliss is the reward of gratitude. The gratitude

28:48.654 --> 29:05.630
which is not just worldly or just spoken lip-service,
but is from the heart, is from the heart,

29:05.784 --> 29:16.621
gratitude of the heart. And the blissful people
are never jealous of others because what is

29:16.794 --> 29:25.901
greater than bliss? Bliss has so many dimensions
that you go beyond the realm of cause and

29:26.194 --> 29:34.014
effects. All the angels, all the ganas are
there to help you. You know that it works

29:34.274 --> 29:39.524
out. This way it works out, that…. But you
take it for granted. You don’t have that

29:39.524 --> 29:47.772
effect of the bliss in you when you know this
has happened, that, has happened. What a bliss!

29:48.134 --> 29:53.684
You cross your hearts when you feel blissful.
Cross your hearts and feel that, just see.

29:53.684 --> 30:00.634
Feel the bliss like this – cross your hearts.
Feel the bliss! Tremendous bliss is within

30:00.634 --> 30:14.593
us. How much it has happened to us that God
has been so kind. Will you please put your

30:15.144 --> 30:21.764
hands across those who are sitting down there,
please! The other lady also. Where is she

30:21.764 --> 30:37.322
looking? You are sitting on a chair, must
you look at every person who is coming? There

30:37.585 --> 30:55.463
is no need!. Feel it! May God bless you.
So this bliss when you find everywhere, in

30:55.744 --> 31:06.417
a little thing also you find there is bliss.
Zen taught that to people. They saw bliss

31:06.414 --> 31:13.414
in seeing only a moss, a little bit of moss,
and you see the moss and you say, “0 God,

31:13.744 --> 31:20.174
what a beautiful piece it is! ” God has
created little moss, and that moss has all

31:20.174 --> 31:28.890
that little little tentacles, and that bliss.
But those who are vain people can never feel

31:28.984 --> 31:42.991
bliss. Vanity kills bliss. Ego kills bliss.
Once Shivaji was building a huge fort. And,

31:43.254 --> 31:51.831
there it so happened that he got into ego.
He felt, “See because of this work, so many

31:51.845 --> 32:01.942
people are employed.” [Then] his Guru Ramdasa
appeared on the scene. He himself is the controller

32:02.064 --> 32:08.554
of ego, because he was the incarnation of
Hanumana. So he came and he said “Alright,

32:08.554 --> 32:14.864
I want you to do one thing for me”. He said,
“Yes Sir, what do you want me to do?”

32:14.864 --> 32:20.514
He said, “You break this boulder that is
lying here, such a big boulder, bit by bit.”

32:20.514 --> 32:29.632
So it started breaking when people hit it.
And inside came a little stone which he took

32:29.924 --> 32:38.697
up just like a coconut in his hand and he
broke [it]. And there was water and there

32:38.784 --> 32:50.189
was a frog inside. And he realised, Shivaji,
that, “if God has created this frog, He’s

32:50.595 --> 32:57.144
also given him water. Who am I to have this
ego?”

32:57.144 --> 33:09.342
So the bliss came into him, that God has provided
me with everything. It’s just a red-carpet

33:09.524 --> 33:15.614
treatment for me. What have I done? Nothing.
It is so beautiful!

33:15.614 --> 33:25.462
How many have got this bliss? Have sympathy
for them. Have compassion for them, those

33:25.804 --> 33:35.602
who do not have.
But bliss comes to you through your confidence,

33:35.854 --> 33:42.854
If you have no confidence in yourself, bliss
cannot be. And the worst thing against confidence

33:43.504 --> 33:49.705
is – “Then what should I do? Then how
can I get it? Then why not I have?” – is

33:49.705 --> 34:01.446
the worst. You fighting yourself all the time!
You are that, sitting on that, and still if

34:01.744 --> 34:07.755
you are saying, “Why shouldn’t have it,”
so what to answer? I mean you just want to

34:07.755 --> 34:19.831
ask because you have to ask? It’s there.
Why are you asking? Just feel it!

34:21.008 --> 34:32.788
If that works out, that you feel where you
are sitting, then you’ll be surprised that

34:33.705 --> 34:37.844
you are at peace with yourself, and there
is bliss.

34:45.784 --> 34:52.784
Last of all, in this culture, you Have to
behave like people who have authority. You

34:52.784 --> 35:02.486
have the authority of your Spirit. You are
authorised. You have the Spirit. Those who

35:02.556 --> 35:08.326
are in authority never try to show off. Because
they are in authority, what is there to show

35:08.326 --> 35:20.310
off? Only mad people show off, you see.
If somebody puts a label on the head “I

35:20.727 --> 35:27.727
am Inspector General of Police”, people
will say that – take him to lunatic asylum.

35:33.957 --> 35:38.497
In the same way, some people say, “I am
Sahaja Yogi. What do you say? I can do what

35:38.497 --> 35:52.112
I like!” Then where should we put him? Your
authority is your Self, your own being. People

35:52.447 --> 35:59.447
should see in you what you are. You don’t
have to carry labels with you that, “I am

35:59.836 --> 36:10.355
Sahaja Yogi such and such!” – X Y Z number.
criminal No. 5, criminal No. 10! You are authorised.

36:10.397 --> 36:15.737
Authority shows on your face. But now you
are actualised on the authority.

36:15.737 --> 36:22.737
You see, all the authorities are artificial.
For example, somebody today is Prime Minister,

36:22.967 --> 36:28.816
may become a beggar on the street. Could be.
In democracy everything is possible. Same

36:28.816 --> 36:33.766
in any authoritarian governments. So today,
you might be something at the height, you

36:33.766 --> 36:39.997
might just go down. But a Sahaja Yogi will
remain a Sahaja Yogi. You are authorised and

36:39.997 --> 36:44.566
actualised. Means whatever is your authority
is part and parcel of your being, you are

36:44.566 --> 36:49.076
that. Like you are a human being, you are
a human being. Now you can’t grow tails

36:49.076 --> 36:59.546
even if you want.
So now you are authorised, actualised, completely

36:59.887 --> 37:11.459
moulded Sahaja Yogis. Like the sandalwood
– sandalwood is not to be told by taking

37:12.187 --> 37:19.187
a vow “oh, it is sandalwood”. It is sandalwood
because every part of it (microphone stops

37:38.788 --> 37:41.288
All right? You can hear me I think.

37:42.105 --> 37:45.383
You hear me from your Sahasrara.

37:45.996 --> 37:54.494
Every part of you, every bit of you must have the fragrance of Sahaja Yoga.

40:12.254 --> 40:17.397
So you are not only actualised, you are perfected.

40:17.556 --> 40:27.371
You are perfected.
So you must have the dignity of that authority

40:27.536 --> 40:46.274
in you. And dignity is very humble dignity.
Dignity is never arrogant. The sign of dignity

40:46.477 --> 41:03.999
is humility. I told you a story about a person
who had gone out and he went and asked a blind

41:04.056 --> 41:13.300
man, a saint, if he had seen anybody going
this way. So the saint said “Yes, you are

41:13.506 --> 41:20.506
the king, I know Sir. Your servant was here
first, and then your Minister came, and now

41:20.657 --> 41:31.541
you have come.” He was amazed, because he
was blind. How could a blind person see these

41:31.727 --> 41:37.086
things? He said, “I could make out from
the humility.”

41:37.086 --> 41:46.012
When your servant came, he said, “Eh you
blind man! Have you seen somebody going this

41:46.147 --> 41:54.451
way?” When your minister came he said, “Have
you seen someone going this way?” But when

41:54.687 --> 42:02.184
you came, you said “Sir, I am sorry to ask
you such a question, but did you hear somebody

42:02.256 --> 42:18.183
was passing this way?”
This is what it is. Humility is the sign.

42:18.427 --> 42:25.006
How you talk to others, immediately people
will know that you have the authority from

42:25.006 --> 42:43.707
God. See the humbleness of Divine. How it
is trying to please you, and amuse you, and

42:43.987 --> 42:59.268
make you happy, in the nature, also in the
lectures! (referring to the way the microphone

42:59.988 --> 43:19.078
stopped working). Alright?
So now we’ll have our Puja. I hope You have

43:19.316 --> 43:25.987
understood the Culture of your Universal Religion.
Please try to adopt it.

43:27.487 --> 43:29.613
May God Bless you.
