00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:16,299
Final Talk
Sydney, Australia

2
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:06,729
April 19, 1991

3
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:56,890
… now because there’ll be so many Sahaja
yogis here and it will work out, not only

4
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,420
for Sydney, but other places, like New Castle
was a surprise. You’ve seen New Castle how

5
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:11,420
it worked out. You have to go to other, smaller
places which are around.

6
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:25,680
So, we have to know that Sydney people who
are now coming to Sahaja Yoga and we have

7
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:37,149
to strengthen ourselves by meditating also
and also by spreading Sahaja Yoga across.

8
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:46,040
But more if you start paying attention more
to the defects here and the defects there,

9
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,660
then you’ll never grow. What you have to
see is defects within yourself, and it will

10
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:57,660
definitely grow very well. The best way is
to grow yourself and become something that

11
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:06,910
we can say is a solid Sahaja yogi. That’s
much more important, I would say, for all

12
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,529
of you.

13
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:18,529
You can always write to Me. And I always take
heed of that, and I work out many things even

14
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:25,980
before you have written to Me. So, there’s
no need to be frightened of someone, or to

15
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:34,550
be afraid of someone. You can always tell
that person what you think. And nobody will

16
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:40,660
now throw away anyone from Sahaja Yoga without
asking Me. It’s a law.

17
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:47,660
Nobody is going to be thrown out. But, of
course, always I’ll have your photographs

18
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:57,630
with Me. And I know you very well. There’s
nothing to be told. But when I am busy with

19
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:06,940
other people, you should know that Mother
has given such a responsibility on us, we

20
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:14,540
have to grow and let everyone grow. And gradually,
I’m sure, everything will be all right.

21
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:26,540
And so far we have had mishaps, not so much
because of leaders but because of you people,

22
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:34,399
because you should have told Me and you should
have informed Me. Also, I know we are very

23
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:44,149
capable people here, but still people don’t
meditate. That’s why I find they are catching.

24
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:54,629
Once you have got your realization, you should
know what should be the attitude towards yourself.

25
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:04,560
Now we have a Sahaja culture as you know,
and we have to come into that Sahaja culture.

26
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,060
And when we …

27
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:13,060
Ah! Hey, what are you doing? Bad. No. Ah ah.
At this age they pick up these things here,

28
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:35,589
so what do you say of children?
Whose child is this? Just take him. You must

29
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:42,579
correct, yourself. At this age you must correct
. Maybe later on no, but at this age you must

30
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:48,810
correct. You see if they hit, then you hit
them on their hands. Hit where their legs.

31
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,389
Hit them there so they are all right.

32
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:59,389
Now come along, now what’s your name? Hallo?
What’s your name? Such a Right Agnya. Very

33
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:10,790
bright Agnya he has, and also see his eyes
are showing the reason.

34
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:21,180
Gradually everything will be all right. You
have to be grown in Sahaj culture. And also

35
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:28,079
the women have to grow in Sahaj culture; men
have to grow in Sahaj culture. And the women

36
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,680
have to grow in a Sahaj culture is this, that
you should not answer back your husbands at

37
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,199
all. That’s not the way you can conquer
him.

38
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:38,870
They do not understand how they can conquer
their husbands.

39
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:45,600
That’s the main point. Not by answering
them back. Not by torturing them, but by bearing

40
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:52,600
up whatever they are saying. And explosiveness
of women is absolutely wrong. That puts them

41
00:13:53,529 --> 00:14:00,529
off. They come from outside; they are very
tired. And they are themselves in explosive

42
00:14:01,949 --> 00:14:08,949
condition. And then you suddenly do something
to them and they start being explosive. You

43
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:10,019
see?

44
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:16,980
So women, if they cannot run their husbands
and family, all right. Then I think it is

45
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,899
their responsibility. So the responsibility
is much more on women than on men as far as

46
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:23,490
the culture is concerned.

47
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:30,490
Now, what is the matter? Sit down. Sit down
here. Come along. Sit down. Sit down. Be a

48
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,000
nice boy. Otherwise -- Now, sit. Nice boy,
all right?

49
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:51,759
And when you want to say something, don’t
show anger, but determination. You see. Just

50
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:58,759
sit down with them. Then they know what 

51
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:16,530
you mean.

52
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:29,569
So one side of the thing is of establishing
the Sahaj culture among ourselves and being

53
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:40,360
kind to them. In the family, to create peace.
That’s the job of a woman.

54
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:46,100
You see how that man was trying to provoke
Me. But I wriggled out of all his provocations,

55
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,620
bBecause I’m a woman. Any other man would
have slapped him twice I tell you.

56
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:57,530
In My place, any one of them. Krishna must
have used His Sudarshan. And Christ must have

57
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:04,220
hit him with His cross, you see. They cannot
bear, you see. They don’t have so much bearing

58
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:10,300
power. And they cannot wriggle out, you see.
But we can. So that is the quality one has

59
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:14,320
to learn: how to wriggle out of this.

60
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:21,130
Then the men have the work to go out, earn.
Women also, it doesn’t matter. But you must

61
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:28,130
share with them, have companionship with them.
Enjoy your companionship. After all, you see,

62
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:36,720
the romance starts actually after marriage,
not before marriage. I was surprised that

63
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,650
there’s no book which describes the romance
after marriage in English language. I asked

64
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:46,640
so many people to find out if there’s a
book that describes romance after marriage.

65
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,930
They said, “No book.” But in Indian books,
Indian languages, we don’t have any romance

66
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,780
much described before the marriage but always
after the marriage.

67
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:01,340
So I didn’t understand what was this thing
was. After marriage, the romance finishes.

68
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,970
Not in Sahaj culture …

69
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:09,970
Hallo. Now, come along. Ask him to … take
him out … Put him in there in the room.

70
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,910
He’ll be all right. No, you can’t sit
here. Come along. Tell him. Now he’ll be

71
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:24,910
all right. If you beat, you cannot sit here.
Now you take him. No, you take him out. Take

72
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:32,040
him out and put him in the room. He will be
all right. Now, why did you beat?

73
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:54,660
And the men have to know that they have to
respect their women. In the presence of their

74
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:03,960
children specially, they must really respect.
If you’re angry you can do what you like

75
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:10,390
in the bedrooms. In the presence of your children
you should behave yourself. And this is one

76
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:17,390
of the reasons why the children in the West
are not at all obedient. No sense of respect.

77
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:31,620
So the respect that husband pays to the wife
is absolutely important. For example, now

78
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:39,290
supposing I’m sitting here and my husband
is sitting here and I want a glass of water.

79
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:46,230
If I try to get up he’ll ask the children,
“Go and get it for your mother.”

80
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:51,800
If they say, “All right, daddy, should we
put some oil in your head?”

81
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,300
“First put in your mother’s head.”

82
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,640
“Can we go out?”

83
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,140
“Ask her. What does she say.”

84
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:07,760
So put all the authority towards her. This
is the job of men. You see, then only the

85
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:14,760
love grows. Moreover, if wife is sick, she
needs your protection. You must go all out

86
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:23,080
to be gentle, very gentle with them. If the
husband is gentle with the wife, the children

87
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:30,080
will be very gentle, too. How you gently hug
your wife. How you talk to her, how you express

88
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:38,370
yourself to her. It’s all very, very important.
And care for her -- to make her most important.

89
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,970
You see, if she’s sitting uncomfortable,
“Should I make something comfortable for

90
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:50,860
you?” Then if you are decorating, “Aha,
this year Mommy will like very much, isn’t

91
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:55,410
she.” All such things suggest how much the
husband cares for the wife.

92
00:21:55,410 --> 00:22:00,860
Or sometimes bring some present for her, in
the presence of children you should give,

93
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:07,530
so that they also have that respect for the
mother. Gentleness is missing, completely.

94
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:13,680
We are very harsh sometimes. We are volcanic.
And I don’t know how people can stand volcanic

95
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:20,680
women and volcanic men. So to be very gentle
is the best way to live together. And to care

96
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:28,060
for each other is very important. Then you
start missing each other, don’t dominate

97
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,940
each other. On the contrary if the wife is
going towards, then the husband would rush,

98
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,250
say, “No, no, no, no, no, let me go.”

99
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:43,030
Gradually they develop these qualities in
them. Not by fighting, not by quarreling,

100
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:50,020
arguing. Gradually they will develop these
habits. And you’ll be very happy to be in

101
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,630
love with each other.

102
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:59,630
I am only worried about our family system
in Sahaja Yoga. It’s very important, extremely

103
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,620
important. If the family is not all right,
how are we going to keep all of you together?

104
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,060
And I want the whole world to be together.
How can we get the whole world together if

105
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:18,470
you cannot have one family all together? But
in no way it means that you become a slave

106
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:25,050
to your husband or a slave to your wife as
far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned. Sahaja Yoga

107
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:30,110
is above everything. If husband tries to do
something against Sahaja Yog, you should stand

108
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:37,110
against it. If the wife wants to do something
against Sahaja Yoga, you stand up. Nothing

109
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:44,080
else. Because this is something precious you
have got and you have to live with it, and

110
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,950
you have to enjoy it.

111
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:55,950
It is very difficult for people to understand
that Sahaj culture is the only culture in

112
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:03,950
which people can live happily together. There
is no other way out. We start from the very

113
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:12,920
primitive to the most modern. We have imbibed
lots of things of the Indian culture as well

114
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:21,400
as lots of things from the Western culture.
For example, we allow divorce. Not at the

115
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:27,490
slightest thing. It’s not a very good thing
to divorce also, but in case everything fails

116
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:33,510
and everything is so horrid and by law you
feel horrible with your standing, then I say,

117
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:40,510
“All right. You can have this, you can have
the divorce.” So we could have a little

118
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:47,940
compromise on that point. But we have the
least divorces in Sahaja Yoga. Say in a church

119
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:53,040
if there are ten marriages per year ---I don’t
know if they even have so many, but even if

120
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:58,910
they had, nobody goes to the church -- out
of them, nine of them are failures, first

121
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:05,910
year only. Compared to that, we are much better
off. We have some problems, in the beginning

122
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:12,520
sometimes it happens, but on the whole we
are much better off than all other people.

123
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:19,520
Now it’s for you to decide whether you want
to enjoy your wife or your husband or not.

124
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:28,180
If you have everything and you do not know
how to enjoy, then what to do? So all this

125
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:35,410
anger, all this temper should go away. You
should introspect also, “ What am I doing?

126
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:44,250
What am I expecting? What am I doing to the
other party? Why can’t I enjoy?”

127
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:51,790
Just ask this question: “Why can I not enjoy
my wife or my husband?” Just ask this question

128
00:25:53,040 --> 00:26:00,040
and you’ll realize the problem is more with
you than the other party.

129
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:12,280
So our family system has to be absolutely
ideal. And we have to prove to the world that

130
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:19,260
those who are getting married in Sahaja Yoga
are the ideal husband and wife; or those who

131
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:25,670
are Sahaj yogis, even if they are married
outside but they become Sahaja yogis, they

132
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:32,670
become ideal husband and wife. The relationship
between them are the best, and for that, whatever

133
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:44,010
is necessary you should do; whatever has to
be done, you should do. No sacrifice, no adjustment.

134
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:49,940
It’s just our idea. Just our idea.

135
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:56,940
So this is My last advice to you, that have
beautiful families, pure families and love

136
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:07,370
all the children as your own children. It
will work out much better. Nobody should object

137
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:17,500
if some child is corrected. Never. If somebody
corrects your child, you should be thankful

138
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,580
to that person that they have corrected your
child. And then children are frightened of

139
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:27,340
the collective because they think all the
collective are together if they are not misbehaving.

140
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:34,220
You see, if you start supporting on your own
child, then the child becomes, you see, quite

141
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:40,370
clever. It knows that “Nobody can say anything
to me,” but the whole collective -- if just

142
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:47,370
now the child has gone there, you see, they
all have felt it. Because all of us have decided.

143
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:54,570
They’ll all behave. But if somebody had
supported that child, then the children wouldn’t.

144
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:05,190
So all of us should support all the children,
and if some child is wrong, then we all should

145
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:09,040
say, “All right, you’re wrong.”
Because all of them are your children. Take

146
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:13,250
it like that. They are collective children.
You have to look after them; you have to bother

147
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:19,960
about them; you have to help them. Everything
has to be done on a collective basis. But

148
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:25,330
supposing one child is bad, then all of us,
all of us, should tell that child that “You’re

149
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:31,400
bad.” Then he improves. Also we have to
tell them, “You are Sahaja yogis, you can’t

150
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:36,880
do like that. You are Sahaja yogis; you’re
great. You can’t do like this.” And that

151
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,300
will work also, very well.

152
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:48,570
Also other relations we have outside who are
not Sahaja yogis, just see if they are nice

153
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:55,400
people. You need not be rude to them, need
not cut out from them. But if they are rude

154
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:02,400
and if they are against Sahaja Yoga, then
it’s better not go near them. Better not.

155
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:19,600
So you should just try to make a point in
your life that you are going to show Mother

156
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:31,970
that we are very happily married people. And
that’s what it is I want to see among you.

157
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:43,430
Now we are a very big family all over the
world and as you are Ganesha’s patrons here,

158
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:53,240
it’s also important that the family should
be the best in Australia. ‘Cause Ganesha

159
00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:01,560
is the product of a very beautiful family.
I hope you’ll all understand this. Seriously

160
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:07,880
take it up, and work it out and practice it.

161
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:14,880
I’m told that people get angry if somebody
corrects their children. Is very wrong. Never.

162
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:21,100
Feel detached about it. You shouldn’t spoil
your children. And we have had a very bad

163
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:25,930
experience with these children when they came
to India. And we thought from which land they

164
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:29,320
have arrived.

165
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:36,320
My tour has been very successful thanks to
you all. You have worked very hard, I must

166
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,500
say, very hard. Next time I’m told I’ll
have no radio, television, nothing of the

167
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:52,500
kind. Just a waste of time with them. We’ll
just have all posters which are very good

168
00:30:53,670 --> 00:31:00,670
because they emit vibrations by which people
feel much better. We’ll have also beautiful

169
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:10,460
-- what you call them? Banners. Banners. And
wherever is possible, you can put it. And

170
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:26,180
it is My name there; when the wind blows also,
the vibrations are emitted. Also you could

171
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:33,720
go into the newspapers. That’s all right.
But no more of this radio or these things.

172
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,030
The other day I asked some people, “Did
you hear the radio?” Nobody has known if

173
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:42,840
there was a press card. So we are wasting
our time with this radio and television absolutely,

174
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:47,570
we are not going to have anything to do with
it.

175
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:54,570
All those who are coming to India, they should
try to book as early as possible, and let

176
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:02,100
Me know when they are coming; they are all
welcome. This time we are changing our plans.

177
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:08,130
We are going via Madras. I want you to see
the south. So we’ll be traveling not by

178
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:15,130
those horrible buses, but by the train, by
the train this time. Up to Ganapatipule we

179
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:23,520
cannot go by train as you know, but up to
Kolapur. And from Kolapur to Ganapatipule

180
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:28,670
is not such a long distance. The road is quite
nice.

181
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:35,670
This time we are going to very different places
like Madras, Bhairov, Hyderabad, then Puna,

182
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:43,960
and then to Ganapatipule. I hope you’ll
all enjoy your stay this time again in India.

183
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:53,110
And lots of people will be coming again. We
are really having a great success everywhere.

184
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:59,720
I’m sure this time we’ll have many more
people.

185
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,310
If you have money problem, you can write to
Me also. We can make some arrangements for

186
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:10,310
that. But, you see, we cannot reduce now any
more. We have kept the same price throughout

187
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:15,760
because we have to pay for the Russians, for
all these Eastern Bloc people, their food,

188
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,910
their living. We have to lend them money.
There are absolutely, say, about a hundred

189
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:26,020
people coming without a single pai on them.
They’re traveling; so, sorry, but we have

190
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:32,710
to compensate for it. I know it pressurizes
everyone. But we have to compensate.

191
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:36,600
And other nations are at least paying for
their travels.

192
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:43,410
I can’t pay for their travel. That’s a
hundred people traveling. So, as far as Australia

193
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:48,290
is concerned, you don’t have to share that
part.

194
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:55,290
So, may God bless you!

195
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:05,140
Sahaja yogi: Shri Mother. We would like to
give You a little memento of Your tour. It

196
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:19,480
is something that has been with You for some
time. Each time you had a public program or

197
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:26,480
even at the puja it was there. It was made
by Sahaj yogis, a whole series of them, even

198
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:32,319
some children participated in it, into this
screen.

199
00:34:32,319 --> 00:34:39,319
Shri Mataji: Oh, My! Thank you so much. It’s
so beautiful. You know, today only I was just

200
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:54,520
thinking what a nice thing it is. I shouldn’t
desire anything, I think.

201
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:03,040
Now, very beautiful. Very, very beautiful.
It gives so many ideas of colors and things.

202
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:18,650
You have so much of talent here I must say.
But you’ll have to bring it with you.

203
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:25,010
Sahaja yogi: We could dismantle it, You know
that? and just bring You the silk screen.

204
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:28,280
Shri Mataji: Thank you, Alex.

205
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:35,280
Sahaja yogi: Shri Mother, from all your children
in Australia, we thank you in our hearts for

206
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,290
coming and giving us such a wonderful tour.

207
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:45,580
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. Ki Jay!

208
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:52,580
Shri Mataji: And any disease or anything you
have, any problem, you have to tell Steven,

209
00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:01,160
or you can tell Me, or inform Dr. Spiro, or
someone, whomsoever you want to. Any disease.

210
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:07,700
Don’t be shy about it. And I’ll tell you
how to treat it. I mean, normally it is only

211
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:12,890
on the vibrations you have to say left, right,
what is the problem is, but there are certain

212
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,710
things which require more attention …
