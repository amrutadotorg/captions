00:00:04.938 --> 00:00:11.100
Today is considered to be an important day

00:00:11.301 --> 00:00:14.430
in the northern part of the world,

00:00:14.631 --> 00:00:20.643
because the Sun travels from south to north.

00:00:21.336 --> 00:00:25.428
It happens on the same day every year,

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:30.191
because it depends on the movement of the sun.

00:00:30.392 --> 00:00:34.611
So, why do we give so much importance to it?

00:00:34.812 --> 00:00:40.076
What is so special if the Sun comes to the North?

00:00:40.277 --> 00:00:44.760
Why does it give us such happiness?

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.965
The thing is that from Sun only

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:53.663
all our work begin.

00:00:54.307 --> 00:00:59.160
When there is darkness, during the night, we sleep.

00:00:59.361 --> 00:01:03.381
But when the sun rises,

00:01:03.582 --> 00:01:07.769
after that only all our work begins.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:16.207
So the Sun is the one who influences us to do the work.

00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:24.436
And when it comes in our hemisphere (North),

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.416
so, we respect it too much.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.137
The most important thing is

00:01:34.338 --> 00:01:39.742
that rest of the festivals are based on the Moon.

00:01:39.943 --> 00:01:45.911
And this is the only festival that we celebrate

00:01:46.112 --> 00:01:48.870
on the basis of the Sun.

00:01:49.071 --> 00:01:54.669
In our country, Surya Narayan (Sun) is given much importance,

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.963
and people worship the Sun.

00:01:58.164 --> 00:02:00.987
They go to Ganga to take their bath

00:02:01.188 --> 00:02:06.206
and perform many types of rituals.

00:02:06.763 --> 00:02:11.054
But this one day is the most important.

00:02:15.207 --> 00:02:21.153
So, we all must decide that what should we do on this day.

00:02:21.702 --> 00:02:25.042
What work should we do on this special day?

00:02:25.243 --> 00:02:29.629
Typically, we offer namaskar to Surya (Sun), offer water to Surya

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:36.187
and express our gratitude towards Surya.

00:02:36.388 --> 00:02:40.320
But what special thing can we do?

00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:44.531
Specially, what should Sahaja Yogis do?

00:02:45.594 --> 00:02:49.842
You know that Sun has its seat on Agnya chakra,

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:55.087
and Agnya Chakra is used to think about everything.

00:02:55.773 --> 00:02:59.825
So it is very important to clear our Agnya Chakra,

00:03:00.026 --> 00:03:04.897
because it influences the Sun.

00:03:06.411 --> 00:03:11.310
For this (Sun), the importance of Agnya chakra is that

00:03:11.511 --> 00:03:16.949
according to the planets that influence the Agnya,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.285
we get angry at the people,

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.784
and our behavior with them becomes inappropriate.

00:03:28.985 --> 00:03:36.072
We get angry and we end up losing our beliefs.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.247
Agnya is a very important area.

00:03:40.448 --> 00:03:45.836
We should understand that it is the abode of Christ.

00:03:46.328 --> 00:03:51.567
But Christ told only one thing that we should forgive everyone.

00:03:51.768 --> 00:03:55.524
It is very important to forgive.

00:03:55.814 --> 00:03:59.664
Now, how to do that? Many people say: „I have forgiven”,

00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:01.541
but they actually haven't.

00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:06.776
To forgive, it is important to have complete contentment inside.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.488
And we should think that the other will pay for what he has done.

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:13.050
Why should we bother?

00:04:13.251 --> 00:04:16.507
Whatever anyone had said, it will come back to him.

00:04:16.708 --> 00:04:18.810
Why should we interfere?

00:04:19.011 --> 00:04:21.539
In this way, if you become witness,

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:26.266
and you forgive everyone, then your Agnya Chakra will be alright.

00:04:26.652 --> 00:04:30.244
Cleansing the Agnya chakra removes

00:04:30.445 --> 00:04:34.650
a big hurdle in our ascent,

00:04:35.049 --> 00:04:37.807
which blocks our kundalini

00:04:38.008 --> 00:04:39.885
which is our Agnya,

00:04:40.086 --> 00:04:43.549
and for that we must know how to forgive.

00:04:44.056 --> 00:04:46.119
We go on thinking every time,

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.197
how someone hurt us, how someone troubled us!

00:04:49.398 --> 00:04:52.924
Instead, we should think that we have forgiven.

00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:55.348
We have forgiven everyone.

00:04:55.549 --> 00:04:59.348
By forgiving, you will be absolutely surprised

00:04:59.536 --> 00:05:02.054
that Kundalini will rise up in no time.

00:05:02.255 --> 00:05:04.770
We have to focus on raising our own Kundalini,

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:09.440
and for that it is necessary to keep our Agnya clean.

00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:12.080
It is human being's nature to get angry.

00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:15.294
It is not God's nature but it is human's nature.

00:05:15.495 --> 00:05:18.189
So anger should be avoided.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.669
In place of it, one should say forgive, forgive, forgive..

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.430
By repeating like this, your Agnya Chakra will clear.

00:05:27.631 --> 00:05:30.164
Eternal Blessings to all of you!
