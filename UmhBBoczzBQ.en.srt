1
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:14,440
You have not entered into any competition. Just to relax.

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,680
Just relax.

3
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:27,880
Then the more you want to do about Sahaja Yoga,

4
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,440
again you are tensed. "I have to meditate early in the morning;

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,280
I have to get up tomorrow early in the morning".

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,520
You see, you go on torturing yourself.

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,200
The whole night you won't sleep,

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,240
and when you are meditating you are dosing.

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,040
Relax, God is looking after you, believe me.

10
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,160
He is going to give you Realization and He is going to look after you.

11
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,520
He is going to wake you up in the morning too, but relax.

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,800
The first idea that "I can do it" is wrong.

13
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,320
He has to do it.

14
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,800
It's not working out because you think you can do it.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,200
If you can come to this conclusion that "I cannot do it,

16
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,080
it is His mercy, His graciousness that has to work out."

17
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:37,560
But after Realization you have to do something

18
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,080
in the sense you have to desire.

19
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,880
But when I say you have to desire it, again you will say,

20
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,160
"All right. Now I'm going to sit down here and nail myself to this place

21
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,720
and I'm going to sit down and desire."

22
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,440
This desire is a dead desire you see

23
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,320
it is just pushed onto your head that "Oh, I must desire. Mother has told I must desire.

24
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,680
You have to be hungry.

25
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,880
You don't say that "I have to desire that I have to be hungry".

26
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,720
Do you?

27
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:26,840
The hunger is from within which is there, no doubt, but it's clouded.

28
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:37,880
The hunger is clouded because you have fear.

29
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,600
If you put a goat before a tiger

30
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:51,160
and give him to eat he will reduce with that eating whatever it is.

31
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,440
Because it has that fear,

32
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,080
that there is a tiger which is going to eat you.

33
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,760
So first kill all the imaginary tigers around you.

34
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,120
Again you come back to the same.

35
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:15,280
That desire must come from within and it is said, but it is clouded.

36
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,640
Relax!

37
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,880
It should not be that "I'm very relaxed."

38
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,920
It's childlike; it's simple.

39
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,600
A relaxed person is just like a child.

40
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:54,720
So not to get frightened, try to relax.

41
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,360
That's all, for everyone.

42
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,520
But relaxation never means that you are inactive.

43
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:13,680
On the contrary, the person who is relaxed is extremely active

44
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:19,440
on the exterior. But inside he is absolutely silent,

45
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,720
absolutely relaxed and at ease.

46
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,000
Outside you may feel,

47
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,520
as you know, now at this time tremendous vibrations are flowing.

48
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:39,160
And I can see the flow tremendous,

49
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:45,360
and all the chakras are doing like this around Me.

50
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,880
But I see them in their place.

51
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:57,640
At the most I may stop talking, but it is flowing.

52
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:14,600
So whether it is for the seeking or for anything else in the world,

53
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,920
the first thing is

54
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:23,600
that you must take an attitude of a relaxed witness.

55
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,680
If you can do that,

56
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:35,800
then those who are not feeling vibrations will definitely feel.

57
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,240
I see people on whom I've been working,

58
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
and it wouldn't work out.

59
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,880
Of course they were not rude or in any way arrogant

60
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,000
but they felt very sad that they couldn't feel vibrations,

61
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,640
so I said, "All right, today you'll go and

62
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,360
enjoy the flowers in the garden.

63
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,280
Enjoy the birds and talk to the sky and come back tomorrow .

64
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:08,560
It works out. Because you have been always like this.

65
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,920
In Sahaja Yoga you don't have to achieve anything.

66
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,880
You become.

67
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,080
First you become

68
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,880
and then mentally you understand Sahaja Yoga.

69
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,720
But those who try to understand Sahaja Yoga mentally first

70
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,800
are really in for trouble.

71
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,520
Because when you read this, sounds so great

72
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,240
and you think, "Oh God, where am I?"

73
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:58,440
So please, if you give Realization to someone, take it easy.

74
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,920
It will grow.

75
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,600
Don't give The advent to read the next moment.

76
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,520
We do it!

77
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,720
Why we think we should impress a person,

78
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,160
that Sahaja Yoga is a great thing and the person must see that well

79
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,120
so he'll come to Sahaja Yoga,

80
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:23,360
and will establish this man because he will see and he'll be impressed.

81
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,800
If somebody is going to be impressed by these things,

82
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,240
such a person is of no use for Sahaja Yoga, take it from Me.

83
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,160
If they are going to be impressed by something exterior and superficial,

84
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,000
how far will they?

85
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,600
They have to achieve it within themselves, their own Spirit.

86
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,520
They have to be impressed by themselves, by their maturity.
