AI GENERATED. Like a blank.

1
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:07.889
You know,

2
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:08.869
they're.

3
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.479
Oh,

4
00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:13.810
not there.

5
00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:14.720
But yeah,

6
00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:18.899
it's all full of gold.

7
00:00:19.889 --> 00:00:20.350
Golden,

8
00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:21.530
golden this,

9
00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:22.440
that our house,

10
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.940
she said is absolutely for.

11
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.959
This is a modern Arab by the sound of it.

12
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.889
The prince and all that.

13
00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:34.549
I mean that prince who came to see our house was settled down there.

14
00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:37.439
He said if I had money I would have purchased this house immediately.

15
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.560
Ruston is a very tricky fellows is a very tricky fellow.

16
00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.810
Because you see,

17
00:00:58.169 --> 00:01:02.240
he had a lady

18
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.799
who was senior to him,

19
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.190
an Indian lady never married a very manly type,

20
00:01:07.449 --> 00:01:09.029
stayed all over the world,

21
00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:09.959
all over the world,

22
00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:10.330
you see,

23
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.839
like she,

24
00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:13.250
she was the one who was head of that.

25
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.099
And then he came and I said,

26
00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:15.220
all right,

27
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.599
I'll do something about her,

28
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.139
and I gave her band this Saturday.

29
00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:19.800
When he went back,

30
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.889
he telephoned to me,

31
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:21.050
said,

32
00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:22.830
What have you done to this woman?

33
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.470
She's become like a.

34
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.809
Little goat under my feet.

35
00:01:30.949 --> 00:01:30.989
I

36
00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:48.550
But Ruston was very lucky.

37
00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:50.889
He just applied for the job.

38
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.199
The next day he was called,

39
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:53.910
just like that.

40
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.250
And for very,

41
00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:58.180
you see,

42
00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.839
he's getting a pay

43
00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:02.000
as much as he figures I think.

44
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.000
Making a big one.

45
00:02:09.508 --> 00:02:13.080
He sent $2000 for the American trip.

46
00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:46.610
So it seems now.

47
00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:48.589
We have settled down

48
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.139
a very settled feeling.

49
00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:55.800
It's good.

50
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.860
Today's last interview I knew,

51
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.850
you see,

52
00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.690
if I boast about myself,

53
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.250
then it works faster.

54
00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.929
I didn't both,

55
00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:07.210
but it worked out that way.

56
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.119
The people asked me a very direct question,

57
00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:11.369
and now it will settle.

58
00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:12.839
I'm sure it will settle here very well,

59
00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:15.889
going to settle very well.

60
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.809
And as

61
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.559
uh Ron suggested,

62
00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.250
after you people get

63
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:23.270
quite

64
00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:24.479
good

65
00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:25.479
at.

66
00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.779
Uh,

67
00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:27.729
Sanjoga.

68
00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:31.899
Then you can shift

69
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.399
to some nearer

70
00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:37.199
places like there are 7 cities,

71
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.830
you see,

72
00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:40.039
so one of you can go to another city,

73
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.350
another can go to another city like that.

74
00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:46.399
But one thing one must understand that one should never quarrel among yourselves,

75
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.520
never should never quarrel,

76
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.330
never

77
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:50.250
challenge anybody.

78
00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:53.110
And now say Laurie is here.

79
00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:54.830
She's the one whom I know.

80
00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:56.699
And she's supposed

81
00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:57.619
to be

82
00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.350
in connection with me in the sense if we have to write,

83
00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:01.979
we can't write to everyone,

84
00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:04.039
and you should not feel bad

85
00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.350
if I write to her and ask her or

86
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.110
tell her anything till I find she's absolutely useless.

87
00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:12.509
You don't bother about her.

88
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.309
That is important.

89
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.320
If I find her useless,

90
00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:17.480
I throw her out.

91
00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:18.399
There's no problem.

92
00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.798
But you people leave it to me,

93
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:21.839
all right,

94
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.959
so I'll be

95
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.649
connected with her whatever she says and guides,

96
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.480
we should go,

97
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.260
and also she will not because she's a lady,

98
00:04:29.549 --> 00:04:31.890
the ladies have a little restrictive nature always.

99
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.170
I'm also a little bit like that sometimes,

100
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:35.570
but if the

101
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.290
men have the expansive nature,

102
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.880
she should allow you to expand.

103
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.049
Go ahead with it,

104
00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:42.250
but it should not be like a bounder also,

105
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.859
see,

106
00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:45.510
and we must understand that money is.

107
00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:47.480
It's to be,

108
00:04:47.679 --> 00:04:49.470
one has to be careful about it.

109
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.440
One should not waste money on new projects and new things that should not be brought.

110
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.670
If you want to do something you do on your own,

111
00:04:57.959 --> 00:04:59.309
but not to bring the

112
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.790
central

113
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.959
fund

114
00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:03.149
for the health.

115
00:05:03.609 --> 00:05:04.269
Of

116
00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:07.630
projects it's all right for the programme or for this thing.

117
00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:08.589
Later on,

118
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.519
I'm sure when you have more people here,

119
00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:14.010
you won't even need that much for your halls and things.

120
00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:16.309
You may not need at all any money at all.

121
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.470
You might be able to do it yourself,

122
00:05:18.799 --> 00:05:20.329
all those things for your own.

123
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.260
And that's how we should try to be

124
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.989
independent as far as money is concerned.

125
00:05:27.109 --> 00:05:27.510
And

126
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:28.869
if you have any projects,

127
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.540
now these people have had so many projects like that.

128
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.269
I never give any money to them.

129
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.980
On the contrary,

130
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.630
they have been given money for this,

131
00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:37.019
they have so much money

132
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.869
for the work in America.

133
00:05:38.989 --> 00:05:41.540
All the Australians have established themselves,

134
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:42.839
always they have come.

135
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.239
So one should understand that money should not be wasted anywhere.

136
00:05:47.359 --> 00:05:50.010
There's no need to waste money on things,

137
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.369
and

138
00:05:51.679 --> 00:05:55.230
we should be careful because this is the money of the states and we cannot

139
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:56.359
afford to waste it.

140
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.779
You have seen how careful I am myself about it,

141
00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:01.309
so one should not waste the money like that.

142
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.209
We have to still have.

143
00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:03.790
A

144
00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:06.839
very good school in India to begin with,

145
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.299
and we have to have those 56

146
00:06:09.609 --> 00:06:11.700
big ashrams that we are building

147
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:12.920
for new people.

148
00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:16.130
And you can always go and stay there

149
00:06:16.609 --> 00:06:19.209
and we have lots of plans for you

150
00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:20.739
if you want to.

151
00:06:21.549 --> 00:06:22.630
Have a

152
00:06:22.829 --> 00:06:23.450
heart

153
00:06:24.359 --> 00:06:26.070
in our land,

154
00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:27.510
we might be just about.

155
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.510
50 to â‚¹6000 or so you can own a

156
00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:32.989
hut there,

157
00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:33.920
but you see,

158
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.549
we can give ownership as such in according to their laws,

159
00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:39.839
but you will have it as a what do you call that.

160
00:06:41.549 --> 00:06:42.589
Deeds or something,

161
00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:45.739
so you can have it all the time for yourself

162
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.559
in the ash.

163
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.140
we are providing you.

164
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:51.570
But now

165
00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:54.239
we have one problem is to have the school.

166
00:06:55.329 --> 00:06:57.260
And have this Nega thing a little bit

167
00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.149
established so it's quite substantiated by Indians.

168
00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:03.970
Indians have never,

169
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.459
never asked me to give them money.

170
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.440
I must tell you this one thing really so far for the book's book,

171
00:07:10.899 --> 00:07:12.049
partly of course

172
00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:12.809
I donated,

173
00:07:13.059 --> 00:07:14.109
partly they did,

174
00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:18.209
but whatever was possible they did and Gregar's book was published,

175
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.649
and now I have money for republishing that book as well.

176
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:22.140
I mean,

177
00:07:22.179 --> 00:07:24.779
I kept that much money back for republishing.

178
00:07:25.269 --> 00:07:26.140
So now

179
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:27.899
the thing is in the same way.

180
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.880
We should try to develop ourselves completely independent.

181
00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:35.179
Now these schools will be available to all your children,

182
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.910
all those who are schools will be available.

183
00:07:38.989 --> 00:07:41.179
You can also teach in that school

184
00:07:41.549 --> 00:07:44.309
and also the surgeries can go for their conferences.

185
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:47.510
It's a very good school and a good place where we are going to have it.

186
00:07:48.109 --> 00:07:49.829
But for that also we need money.

187
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.230
And I think I told them that

188
00:07:53.649 --> 00:07:57.510
just now only if you can spend how many

189
00:07:58.769 --> 00:08:05.989
it's 100 $100 per every surgery we should try to save for one year

190
00:08:06.329 --> 00:08:08.190
and send it over to Arno.

191
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:13.420
We'll put it in gold and I can raise the price of gold and then we can have more money.

192
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.809
That's why because the amount that we have now is something very,

193
00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:20.429
very

194
00:08:20.899 --> 00:08:21.010
little

195
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.690
to be sent from Europe and America because we didn't have so many people,

196
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.649
but this would be only $100 for one year,

197
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:28.890
once a year,

198
00:08:29.179 --> 00:08:30.290
once for a lifetime.

199
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.130
You have to send it for this.

200
00:08:33.099 --> 00:08:36.659
And that we try to make something out of that.

201
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.599
Indians have already got 8 lakhs with that

202
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.049
and uh

203
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:47.340
and in Bombay they have daily they have got about 4 lakhs.

204
00:08:48.469 --> 00:08:49.590
For Indians are really,

205
00:08:49.669 --> 00:08:50.619
I must tell you,

206
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.059
they have never put any burden on me.

207
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.070
And for the 1st 3 years we never took any money.

208
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.289
All those who came were free.

209
00:08:58.799 --> 00:09:01.989
I would not say that 100% they bought the thing,

210
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.799
but at least 50% expenses they bor.

211
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.210
He went with us one day,

212
00:09:08.349 --> 00:09:09.989
first time when he was.

213
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.500
What was the year you were?

214
00:09:11.909 --> 00:09:13.549
I came to you in 1980,

215
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.989
1980.

216
00:09:15.349 --> 00:09:19.979
So we started this thing from 1974.

217
00:09:21.429 --> 00:09:23.710
So you can imagine 4 years.

218
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:25.549
Uh,

219
00:09:25.799 --> 00:09:26.630
5 years.

220
00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:27.890
Yes,

221
00:09:28.039 --> 00:09:28.630
70,

222
00:09:28.679 --> 00:09:32.409
71 and 2574.

223
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:35.760
74 January.

224
00:09:35.859 --> 00:09:35.890
Oh,

225
00:09:35.929 --> 00:09:36.299
I see,

226
00:09:37.349 --> 00:09:37.539
then,

227
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:37.880
yes,

228
00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:42.599
747475 76,

229
00:09:42.609 --> 00:09:43.679
77

230
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:51.409
774.0.

231
00:09:51.419 --> 00:09:53.330
So it's it's 74 5 76,

232
00:09:53.369 --> 00:09:53.929
77,

233
00:09:53.969 --> 00:09:54.450
78,

234
00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:55.890
795

235
00:09:56.799 --> 00:09:58.369
because I came at the beginning of 80,

236
00:09:58.409 --> 00:10:01.010
so we count 79 5.

237
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:02.679
5 years,

238
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:03.250
you see,

239
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.450
we sustained.

240
00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.820
And quite a lot of people

241
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:07.489
ask that.

242
00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.270
For their food.

243
00:10:12.239 --> 00:10:12.510
Actually,

244
00:10:12.559 --> 00:10:14.150
the year I came to your mother,

245
00:10:16.099 --> 00:10:16.119
you came,

246
00:10:16.239 --> 00:10:17.320
but even then you

247
00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.840
you were offering to pay for everything and

248
00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.909
you just didn't consider taking any money.

249
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.150
I mean we were so bullheaded we didn't even think to offer either,

250
00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.950
but never mind that's another story.

251
00:10:30.669 --> 00:10:32.590
We paid for your stay and everything,

252
00:10:33.549 --> 00:10:36.070
but travelling I think in the end we did,

253
00:10:36.349 --> 00:10:38.099
but we needed a few promptings.

254
00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:41.059
Some people told me that pay for your travelling.

255
00:10:42.409 --> 00:10:42.510
Yes,

256
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:45.219
I mean I really spent a lot of money doing that.

257
00:10:45.229 --> 00:10:45.270
It doesn't.

258
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:51.630
But now what I'm saying is that now we have to understand that.

259
00:10:51.989 --> 00:10:53.409
We have to have our self respect.

260
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:56.010
Actually,

261
00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.590
the amount that you people have gathered also to send

262
00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.969
to India is so little that I felt sad,

263
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:04.210
so I bought gold out of it like with the back.

264
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:05.770
So that also

265
00:11:08.179 --> 00:11:08.229
when they rise,

266
00:11:08.299 --> 00:11:09.049
this 100

267
00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:10.510
will just be the beginning,

268
00:11:10.539 --> 00:11:11.809
I feel for the West.

269
00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.729
It'll just be a nominal contribution from now on.

270
00:11:14.979 --> 00:11:17.020
I think the West will undertake a tremendous.

271
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:20.849
Effort in this regard and certainly I'll be doing my best to

272
00:11:20.849 --> 00:11:25.700
encourage everybody because we can do it $100 per year at least,

273
00:11:26.049 --> 00:11:26.559
at least.

274
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.559
I mean if we can raise $14,000 for America.

275
00:11:30.469 --> 00:11:35.440
I mean in Australia 15,000 altogether I mean putting my money too a little bit.

276
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:39.260
It's only the beginning.

277
00:11:39.489 --> 00:11:40.799
That's a token.

278
00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:44.960
We have to think on a big scale.

279
00:11:47.219 --> 00:11:48.780
Every year $100 is all right,

280
00:11:48.859 --> 00:11:49.419
I think

281
00:11:49.979 --> 00:11:50.770
would be sensible,

282
00:11:50.859 --> 00:11:51.619
not more than that.

283
00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.580
Every year 100 means per month.

284
00:11:53.609 --> 00:11:53.630
How much?

285
00:11:57.669 --> 00:11:59.289
$12.11 dollars

286
00:12:04.299 --> 00:12:04.650
a privilege.

287
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.770
Let's start with this.

288
00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:08.869
Let's do it one year like that.

289
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:09.059
We'll see about it gently you see there's not much need

290
00:12:09.059 --> 00:12:09.179
because they have got money in the bank in India,

291
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.929
but I mean Indians if they can do so much,

292
00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.330
what about us?

293
00:12:28.869 --> 00:12:29.909
They will give you the land,

294
00:12:29.989 --> 00:12:30.580
and everything.

295
00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.080
And then when you go there,

296
00:12:33.159 --> 00:12:35.530
you'd have a comfortable place to live in.

297
00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.030
That's the main thing now you don't have any comfortable place to live.

298
00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:43.809
We do and we have to pay it's not so comfortable

299
00:12:43.809 --> 00:12:46.030
and we have to pay quite a lot to them also,

300
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:46.659
isn't it.

301
00:12:48.109 --> 00:12:49.270
They'd be more economical,

302
00:12:49.349 --> 00:12:51.000
more sensible.

303
00:12:54.929 --> 00:12:57.719
And also now you see the prices are going up.

304
00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.150
So I have said now â‚¹4000 for a month.

305
00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:05.510
Everybody is shocked with that only the â‚¹4000 but

306
00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:07.280
what I'm saying I can't say next year may

307
00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.840
not be so and maybe after 2 years or 3 years I may have to stop this.

308
00:13:10.919 --> 00:13:14.119
Then you people will have to move above and it's for

309
00:13:14.119 --> 00:13:16.789
you people only because everybody has a house in India.

310
00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.210
Who's going to stay in the ashram.

311
00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:22.289
No,

312
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.190
I mean,

313
00:13:23.229 --> 00:13:27.419
we cannot have an ashram like this in no question because everybody has a house.

314
00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.070
There's no question of anybody staying in the national

315
00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:35.099
in out of question.

316
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:36.919
For Indians,

317
00:13:37.119 --> 00:13:37.450
Indians,

318
00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:38.539
it is out of question.

319
00:13:39.539 --> 00:13:40.960
They've already established

320
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.369
theirs and they all have houses of their own.

321
00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:45.090
If they are young,

322
00:13:45.169 --> 00:13:48.239
they stay with their parents and they have their own houses.

323
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.049
So everybody has a house sort of thing.

324
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:54.150
So,

325
00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:55.380
ask them if you have.

326
00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.429
I don't think unless until they retire,

327
00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:00.690
they won't be there.

328
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.979
So it's you people who need an ashram more than anybody else.

329
00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:08.640
From this mad world if you have to go out sometimes.

330
00:14:14.109 --> 00:14:14.119
So

331
00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:17.659
these 100 things you should send it to Arno,

332
00:14:18.969 --> 00:14:25.729
and for the journey is $400 400 dollars to my dollar account

333
00:14:26.039 --> 00:14:27.340
and for your travelling.

334
00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:28.340
I'll have to find out.

335
00:14:28.859 --> 00:14:30.940
I'll send a circular as soon as I go back

336
00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.390
I'll find out from Air India what is the situation.

337
00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:35.250
Mother's Laurie,

338
00:14:35.739 --> 00:14:37.500
Mother's going to try and make a block booking

339
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.830
for North America as well as England and Europe.

340
00:14:40.609 --> 00:14:42.260
And at a good price

341
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.559
and you go by Air India,

342
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.109
no problem.

343
00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:45.510
You see,

344
00:14:45.559 --> 00:14:47.590
Air India is adjustable for us.

345
00:14:47.929 --> 00:14:48.880
We can talk to them.

346
00:14:49.039 --> 00:14:50.159
They'll take all your luggage,

347
00:14:50.239 --> 00:14:50.669
no problem.

348
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:51.070
You see,

349
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.289
you go by some

350
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.950
Iran Airlines or some sort of a thing and get stranded.

351
00:14:56.159 --> 00:14:57.960
Some people got stranded in Kabul.

352
00:14:58.130 --> 00:14:58.679
You know that?

353
00:15:06.119 --> 00:15:07.690
So why don't know this person got stranded in Kabul.

354
00:15:09.359 --> 00:15:11.299
They came by some plane.

355
00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.719
I've forgotten the plane.

356
00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:13.549
This was

357
00:15:14.359 --> 00:15:15.049
not this year,

358
00:15:15.119 --> 00:15:15.750
last year.

359
00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:18.690
I don't know I forgotten their names,

360
00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:20.770
and they got stranded in Kabul

361
00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:25.039
and then a telegram came to us saying that we are stranded in Kabul.

362
00:15:25.659 --> 00:15:27.940
So you see all these things one should not try.

363
00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:28.200
You see,

364
00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:29.419
if you cannot afford to go,

365
00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:29.979
better not.

366
00:15:31.309 --> 00:15:34.090
But they mustn't go on any of these to do such a thing?

367
00:15:34.099 --> 00:15:34.150
I don't understand.

368
00:15:39.929 --> 00:15:41.570
You see some of these Kabul,

369
00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:43.840
what airline goes via Kabul?

370
00:15:44.349 --> 00:15:52.890
I don't know it's probably Afghanistan Air Afghanistan Airline Afghanistan and

371
00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:55.380
they got stranded there because this problem of Russian business.

372
00:15:58.969 --> 00:16:00.280
Afghanistan.

373
00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:02.750
So they got to Afghanistan Airlines from where

374
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.190
I don't know and how they arrived there

375
00:16:07.109 --> 00:16:08.309
straightforward you must go.

376
00:16:08.349 --> 00:16:12.159
And another is they told me is a very bad one is you should never go Syrians.

377
00:16:18.724 --> 00:16:19.945
Have you had problems.

378
00:16:20.184 --> 00:16:21.484
I was stuck there with you?

379
00:16:21.494 --> 00:16:21.505
Well,

380
00:16:23.625 --> 00:16:24.465
I was in Bombay,

381
00:16:24.505 --> 00:16:25.094
if you remember,

382
00:16:25.104 --> 00:16:25.265
mother,

383
00:16:25.315 --> 00:16:27.164
and I had this open ticket which I thought,

384
00:16:27.224 --> 00:16:27.424
great,

385
00:16:27.505 --> 00:16:29.174
I can come back whenever I like.

386
00:16:29.424 --> 00:16:30.465
When I got to Bombay,

387
00:16:30.585 --> 00:16:32.544
I found out they weren't running a jumbo.

388
00:16:32.585 --> 00:16:33.375
It was like a

389
00:16:33.705 --> 00:16:37.544
half-size plane and there was a 3 month waiting list to come back.

390
00:16:38.419 --> 00:16:39.349
You put a ban it,

391
00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:39.539
mother,

392
00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:40.799
and he got it immediately,

393
00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:40.890
but

394
00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:50.859
waiting because everybody was trying to leave Bombay because we were shouting

395
00:16:50.859 --> 00:16:53.659
at Graham for being so stupid as to book it like that.

396
00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:57.030
I thought it would be good to have it open so I could come back when

397
00:17:03.969 --> 00:17:04.050
it was very dangerous,

398
00:17:04.108 --> 00:17:04.130
you know,

399
00:17:04.209 --> 00:17:06.479
I had to pay a ticket last time

400
00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:10.729
we bought one ticket then we paid for my ticket,

401
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:11.640
ticket.

402
00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:13.459
The whole ticket was cancelled.

403
00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.020
The kind of we had such a ticket.

404
00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:15.089
Don't go to him.

405
00:17:15.098 --> 00:17:15.118
In fact,

406
00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:15.219
when I wanted to go to India,

407
00:17:15.229 --> 00:17:15.270
he was offering,

408
00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:15.449
he was trying to sell me a ticket that was ridiculously expensive,

409
00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:34.189
you know,

410
00:17:34.369 --> 00:17:35.280
so expensive.

411
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:42.099
Very expensive ticket to either he gives very expensive or this kind

412
00:17:42.099 --> 00:17:45.489
of this time he gave a big expensive ticket to us also.

413
00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.020
Isn't it?

414
00:17:49.489 --> 00:17:49.569
Well,

415
00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:51.569
you gave him the instructions,

416
00:17:51.969 --> 00:17:52.790
to just buy it

417
00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:54.880
like this from the Air India.

418
00:17:55.709 --> 00:17:55.739
I told him

419
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:01.250
there is one or you told him he didn't even was

420
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:04.930
for 340 actually he still tried to charge you more.

421
00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:05.530
Then I said,

422
00:18:05.569 --> 00:18:05.959
but

423
00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:07.719
you promised mother 280,

424
00:18:07.729 --> 00:18:09.569
and he wanted to charge you 299.

425
00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:09.920
Really

426
00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:12.650
that's very bad on his part to do and he'd already

427
00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:12.810
agreed to gone to the opening of his new office as well

428
00:18:20.939 --> 00:18:22.329
he's doing very well with that,

429
00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:25.890
but he doesn't understand that he should not make money out of me.

430
00:18:27.859 --> 00:18:32.469
He very quickly changed and the first he gave me was so bad that we had to change,

431
00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.800
and I said now I return this ticket to get

432
00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:40.670
to Canada had to come from Houston up to Dallas,

433
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.069
Dallas across to Los Angeles.

434
00:18:43.219 --> 00:18:45.479
Los Angeles we had to run between two aircraft.

435
00:18:45.599 --> 00:18:47.069
Mother was running literally,

436
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.119
then up to here to Vancouver.

437
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:51.359
All in one day

438
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:53.680
And then a programme the same night.

439
00:18:56.119 --> 00:18:56.219
No,

440
00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:56.339
no,

441
00:18:56.459 --> 00:18:56.500
no,

442
00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:57.959
we not have him anymore now.

443
00:18:58.540 --> 00:18:59.640
He's trying to cheat I didn't know.

444
00:19:02.989 --> 00:19:03.910
I telling me something like that.

445
00:19:04.219 --> 00:19:06.160
That's what upset Billy so much as well.

446
00:19:06.199 --> 00:19:07.500
When Billy was working for him,

447
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:08.109
he said,

448
00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.050
I can't stand it.

449
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:09.939
I'm so jokey.

450
00:19:09.979 --> 00:19:13.069
I can't stand working for somebody who thinks about money all the time.

451
00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:15.420
Mm

452
00:19:17.349 --> 00:19:19.819
I think it's much better to deal directly with Air India.

453
00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:25.390
So we'll do it directly and then give us some concession they said

454
00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:26.920
but whatever it is we

455
00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.119
we already get 10% automatically in Australia,

456
00:19:30.199 --> 00:19:31.839
so I'm sure will get better than that.

457
00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:33.839
I can't.

458
00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:34.000
Well,

459
00:19:34.119 --> 00:19:35.550
I mean better in the sense that

460
00:19:36.229 --> 00:19:37.520
better than they can get.

461
00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.280
Yeah.

462
00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:45.819
Can you pop the cat out?

463
00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:51.109
CP CP said he'll get me that.

464
00:19:51.479 --> 00:19:52.920
He said that what is my commission?

465
00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:56.300
I said what is mine first of all.

466
00:20:04.609 --> 00:20:04.640
What is I

467
00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.199
never taken any commission so far.

468
00:20:09.239 --> 00:20:11.219
I know you don't know also how to do it.

469
00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:18.510
But honesty goes a long way.

470
00:20:21.969 --> 00:20:22.310
I'm.

471
00:20:26.369 --> 00:20:27.040
You see

472
00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:28.699
That way

473
00:20:29.349 --> 00:20:31.790
they have been doing very well if you see to it.

474
00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:36.339
People have been living in ashrams in such beautiful ashrams in England,

475
00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:36.969
isn't it?

476
00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:40.189
And we have had a big huge hotel to ourselves to big old huge places.

477
00:20:42.859 --> 00:20:45.420
Then the surton was another big blessing to us,

478
00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:46.130
I tell you,

479
00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.290
and that uh

480
00:20:47.739 --> 00:20:49.650
Nightingale Lane was another blessing.

481
00:20:49.699 --> 00:20:50.109
I mean,

482
00:20:50.339 --> 00:20:53.810
people could not believe that Is that they're living in such good places.

483
00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:00.410
So we spent a little more money for,

484
00:21:00.579 --> 00:21:03.420
but all this is your own property for ever and ever,

485
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:04.170
so it's all right.

486
00:21:04.949 --> 00:21:08.540
We bought some washing machine and that also we got so cheap at

487
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.459
one for the price you.

488
00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:14.520
Yes.

489
00:21:14.579 --> 00:21:14.859
Nobody could believe sheets,

490
00:21:14.939 --> 00:21:15.390
blankets,

491
00:21:15.619 --> 00:21:16.180
bedspreads,

492
00:21:16.319 --> 00:21:17.300
dining room tables,

493
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:18.140
chairs,

494
00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:18.780
cushions,

495
00:21:18.939 --> 00:21:19.949
lounge suites.

496
00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:20.530
Washing machine fridge freezer

497
00:21:32.819 --> 00:21:32.900
and one big

498
00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:41.290
you cancelled that 1000 upstairs actually that

499
00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:43.810
if you cancel that 1000 thing you bought

500
00:21:45.839 --> 00:21:47.050
that lounge suit.

501
00:21:48.329 --> 00:21:49.790
The parting from

502
00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:51.670
Italy was how much?

503
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.520
7 was the one that sofa.

504
00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:58.449
I think the red ones.

505
00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:03.739
More than that.

506
00:22:05.599 --> 00:22:05.619
How much?

507
00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:05.640
No,

508
00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:05.670
not exactly.

509
00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:05.750
You mean the red one?

510
00:22:09.939 --> 00:22:11.579
I thought it was approaching 1000,

511
00:22:11.619 --> 00:22:12.109
but I didn't.

512
00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:14.890
I didn't actually see the price on it.

513
00:22:17.479 --> 00:22:18.920
So you can imagine

514
00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:21.530
and then also 3 sofa sets.

515
00:22:23.579 --> 00:22:24.189
T3 sofas,

516
00:22:24.219 --> 00:22:24.969
it's all wood.

517
00:22:25.079 --> 00:22:25.750
It's wood

518
00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.329
and sheets and

519
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:30.260
beds and beds,

520
00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:30.790
everything,

521
00:22:31.099 --> 00:22:34.400
everything that you think of even a kitchen services,

522
00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:35.300
s,

523
00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:38.420
knives and forks and how many tables,

524
00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:40.969
4 tables,

525
00:22:41.469 --> 00:22:42.900
4 tables and how many chairs,

526
00:22:42.939 --> 00:22:43.969
16 chairs

527
00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.599
and solid 5.

528
00:22:47.369 --> 00:22:47.380
So

529
00:22:58.229 --> 00:22:58.750
many things to a nest of tables and one big coffee table.

530
00:23:01.189 --> 00:23:03.800
and one bath bath suit,

531
00:23:06.229 --> 00:23:09.229
bath suit things that.

532
00:23:11.579 --> 00:23:12.500
Can't believe it.

533
00:23:20.569 --> 00:23:22.479
No one can believe it when you see that.

534
00:23:23.859 --> 00:23:23.900
Basic uh

535
00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:26.920
drawers and

536
00:23:27.719 --> 00:23:28.520
Everything

537
00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:31.780
And carpets.

538
00:23:33.989 --> 00:23:34.780
What about the carpets,

539
00:23:35.069 --> 00:23:36.290
carpet was

540
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:38.939
for it was for how much?

541
00:23:38.949 --> 00:23:39.469
1,

542
00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:41.469
not even 1 part per square yard turned out to be a very,

543
00:23:41.479 --> 00:23:41.530
very good bargain,

544
00:23:41.569 --> 00:23:41.619
very good bargain,

545
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:41.660
bargain.

546
00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:49.969
It was 11 pound.

547
00:23:51.189 --> 00:23:52.910
Or 50% or something like that

548
00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:54.119
1st 2 yard

549
00:23:54.709 --> 00:23:55.609
and with a matting,

550
00:23:55.709 --> 00:23:56.719
rubber matting.

551
00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:00.030
Matai,

552
00:24:00.189 --> 00:24:00.500
um,

553
00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:03.520
Laurie was telling me about this house.

554
00:24:08.619 --> 00:24:09.910
Did she talk to you talked to her how much it cost and all that.

555
00:24:10.069 --> 00:24:10.189
Well,

556
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:12.380
the owners are an investment of some

557
00:24:12.589 --> 00:24:13.790
trust company or something,

558
00:24:13.829 --> 00:24:15.300
and they're anxious to be rid of it,

559
00:24:15.469 --> 00:24:19.300
and I know that in real estate means that it's a liability to them and

560
00:24:19.869 --> 00:24:22.579
therefore the market price would be quite good,

561
00:24:22.959 --> 00:24:23.430
but

562
00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:26.839
They need to get themselves established with

563
00:24:26.839 --> 00:24:30.530
this registration as a charitable organisation,

564
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:31.079
so

565
00:24:31.329 --> 00:24:33.410
I don't think they've got enough money here to do that.

566
00:24:33.689 --> 00:24:35.099
They're literally very near the end.

567
00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:36.530
It's not going to cost much,

568
00:24:36.619 --> 00:24:40.959
just a few $100 but we can perhaps all of us can perhaps help

569
00:24:42.569 --> 00:24:44.449
just to help them get the legal identity,

570
00:24:44.489 --> 00:24:47.640
then actually they get a further grant from the government

571
00:24:48.449 --> 00:24:49.239
for that

572
00:24:49.569 --> 00:24:50.329
on top of this.

573
00:24:50.369 --> 00:24:51.560
So when they're buying the house,

574
00:24:51.689 --> 00:24:53.689
if they ever got to that position.

575
00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:55.380
They would get a further grant from

576
00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.670
the government being a charitable organisation.

577
00:24:59.079 --> 00:24:59.390
That's good.

578
00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:07.469
That I'll give you what you say I was going to ring a few barristers in

579
00:25:07.469 --> 00:25:11.750
town here just to find out because I know the ropes or James knows the ropes from

580
00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:12.390
Australia.

581
00:25:12.839 --> 00:25:16.589
We've done it now and we can just ring a few people and see what's involved,

582
00:25:17.239 --> 00:25:19.829
what the costs are and what the requirements are you could do that tomorrow.

583
00:25:26.849 --> 00:25:27.359
And see,

584
00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:27.579
you know,

585
00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.449
just what we're up for in costs.

586
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:31.119
No.

587
00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:36.449
I mean a house like this is great it's a wonderful asset,

588
00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:40.680
but then how will you purchase?

589
00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:43.300
News coming.

590
00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:43.949
Yes,

591
00:25:44.109 --> 00:25:44.550
that's true,

592
00:25:44.589 --> 00:25:47.819
but you have to pay down payment or you have to pay it would be like that,

593
00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.229
but if it is a trust thing,

594
00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:55.469
then you'll get it for cheap.

595
00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:59.839
We may be able to get a co op type mortgage,

596
00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:01.920
a cooperative mortgage.

597
00:26:03.319 --> 00:26:03.329
James,

598
00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:06.719
good to have a little look into this tomorrow.

599
00:26:06.819 --> 00:26:08.160
He's an expert in this.

600
00:26:11.369 --> 00:26:12.160
You're the expert,

601
00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:12.329
mother,

602
00:26:12.469 --> 00:26:12.729
aren't you?

603
00:26:14.199 --> 00:26:14.520
Ah,

604
00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:16.000
you see,

605
00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:16.790
it works out,

606
00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:17.810
that's all I can say,

607
00:26:17.839 --> 00:26:18.800
but I'm not an expert.

608
00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.489
It works out with me,

609
00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.189
things work out very well.

610
00:26:26.599 --> 00:26:28.689
It works out in such a beautiful way,

611
00:26:28.959 --> 00:26:30.400
sometimes you just can't understand.

612
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:31.719
Mother,

613
00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.390
may I just mention one thing,

614
00:26:33.479 --> 00:26:34.030
the,

615
00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.829
now the mother ashram in Sydney,

616
00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:37.670
um,

617
00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.369
it's up for sale.

618
00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.140
The in,

619
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:42.180
in Sydney,

620
00:26:42.859 --> 00:26:43.449
yes,

621
00:26:43.859 --> 00:26:44.219
um.

622
00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:46.150
I,

623
00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:47.109
before I came away,

624
00:26:47.229 --> 00:26:47.390
Mother,

625
00:26:47.469 --> 00:26:48.750
I made an offer on it,

626
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:50.670
uh without checking with you first,

627
00:26:50.719 --> 00:26:51.060
but

628
00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:53.020
of 160,000,

629
00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:54.270
it's worth about

630
00:26:54.709 --> 00:26:56.530
most probably 190,

631
00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:57.900
but he wants a,

632
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:59.699
he wanted 300,000,

633
00:26:59.709 --> 00:26:59.880
mother,

634
00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:02.099
and I told him that that was far too much.

635
00:27:02.569 --> 00:27:03.489
And he's

636
00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:06.719
he's sort of talking in the vicinity now of

637
00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:08.569
250,000,

638
00:27:08.609 --> 00:27:10.310
which is still a long way,

639
00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:10.770
so,

640
00:27:11.089 --> 00:27:14.729
but at the moment there is a sort of a negotiation going on

641
00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:16.439
and then I came here,

642
00:27:16.969 --> 00:27:17.530
but I.

643
00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:19.170
I don't know,

644
00:27:19.189 --> 00:27:19.390
Mother,

645
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:21.359
whether that would be a good idea for us to buy it.

646
00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:23.750
Perhaps that money should be better spent in India,

647
00:27:24.109 --> 00:27:24.750
things like that.

648
00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:26.270
I don't know if we were.

649
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:27.349
See if it comes off,

650
00:27:27.359 --> 00:27:27.400
if it comes off,

651
00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:27.420
then

652
00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:37.589
it's meant to be.

653
00:27:37.599 --> 00:27:37.709
I was going to continue it when I went back and

654
00:27:37.709 --> 00:27:39.290
then you can expand it if it's a freehold thing,

655
00:27:39.329 --> 00:27:43.939
you can expand it more because you may have to bring something

656
00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.609
on an upper story there you see when my birthday was celebrated,

657
00:27:52.209 --> 00:27:56.400
I mean the people were really jammed up completely and it's a very huge thing.

658
00:27:59.199 --> 00:28:00.430
There should be a place,

659
00:28:00.439 --> 00:28:02.250
I personally think should be anywhere,

660
00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:02.650
whatever it is

661
00:28:03.579 --> 00:28:10.800
where you have a large hall like thing because last time there were so many people.

662
00:28:10.959 --> 00:28:11.739
That's what we lack,

663
00:28:11.829 --> 00:28:14.300
Mother in Sydney we really lack that,

664
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:17.229
and we'd be very grateful if we ever get something that's

665
00:28:17.869 --> 00:28:20.979
more suitable with a big hall like you often,

666
00:28:21.109 --> 00:28:21.750
like we found,

667
00:28:21.829 --> 00:28:22.219
for example,

668
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:23.109
in Switzerland.

669
00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:25.560
That's wonderful.

670
00:28:28.849 --> 00:28:28.920
That's my feet.

671
00:28:29.849 --> 00:28:30.030
Sydney if you can get some better this is right or whatever you may say,

672
00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:30.109
but long term may not be true.

673
00:28:30.119 --> 00:28:30.219
I did have some doubts in here about it,

674
00:28:30.229 --> 00:28:30.260
but I just

675
00:28:49.359 --> 00:28:50.619
started it to just let you know away from Sydney

676
00:28:54.229 --> 00:28:57.520
a little away from Sydney if you can get a big place,

677
00:28:57.599 --> 00:28:58.709
it's better to have it.

678
00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.959
For the same amount you might get a bigger place.

679
00:29:02.119 --> 00:29:03.520
we would out a little bit,

680
00:29:05.719 --> 00:29:06.719
and that's better to be there,

681
00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:08.709
because

682
00:29:09.479 --> 00:29:12.079
of course a place like this is good for

683
00:29:12.079 --> 00:29:15.130
people to come down and you need something central,

684
00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:17.709
but one thing,

685
00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.130
but

686
00:29:19.869 --> 00:29:20.540
Actually,

687
00:29:21.069 --> 00:29:23.619
such a place could be in a good locality,

688
00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:24.819
some place where

689
00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:27.020
people can come for weekends

690
00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:33.640
can stay there for weekends,

691
00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:34.310
and they could be there.

692
00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:39.819
All Sydney people can come for weekends and then contribute to the cost too,

693
00:29:40.829 --> 00:29:42.660
contribute to the cost as well.

694
00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:45.069
This is a new idea of mothers actually where

695
00:29:45.069 --> 00:29:47.390
the people that don't necessarily live in the ashram.

696
00:29:47.939 --> 00:29:51.650
All come to the ashram for the weekend and contribute to the running costs.

697
00:29:52.579 --> 00:29:55.020
Little away if it is from Sydney they would like to come near a lake

698
00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.369
or near a river or something

699
00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:02.500
just to come down there to have a little sort of a

700
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.760
much better and then Saturday Sunday if they stay with you,

701
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.010
you see there'll be more

702
00:30:07.449 --> 00:30:08.859
sort of much more than I'll get started on it as soon as I go back

703
00:30:16.949 --> 00:30:17.030
and do something that's much better.

704
00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:20.300
And it's substantial and nobody will disturb you there.

705
00:30:20.729 --> 00:30:21.660
The neighbours problem,

706
00:30:21.739 --> 00:30:22.380
this problem,

707
00:30:22.479 --> 00:30:24.209
and there's more space to expand

708
00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:30.339
in Sydney.

709
00:30:30.349 --> 00:30:30.390
You must have,

710
00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:31.349
you can get it.

711
00:30:31.579 --> 00:30:35.969
I know I've seen this fellow who was this what was his name,

712
00:30:36.219 --> 00:30:37.130
the one who

713
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:40.229
whose house we had that lawn we went down,

714
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:41.530
huge big lawn

715
00:30:42.199 --> 00:30:45.520
we settled down there whose wife is Polish.

716
00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:47.060
Which country,

717
00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:54.979
Switzer Sydney.

718
00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:55.550
See,

719
00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:57.890
he had a nice place,

720
00:30:57.930 --> 00:30:59.530
but the place was not covered,

721
00:30:59.569 --> 00:31:00.050
you see.

722
00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:01.849
So if you could have something

723
00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:03.170
like that and covered,

724
00:31:03.209 --> 00:31:04.839
or we can make a hall there,

725
00:31:06.949 --> 00:31:09.579
you can make like using the back lawn as a big hall

726
00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:13.449
and sort of we can have a hall,

727
00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:14.130
double hall,

728
00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:16.229
or maybe that for people,

729
00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:18.599
ladies to sleep and gents to sleep,

730
00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:21.079
some bathrooms and bedding and.

731
00:31:24.229 --> 00:31:25.380
Some bathrooms,

732
00:31:25.949 --> 00:31:26.459
one good

733
00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:29.339
bathroom or big bathroom for them,

734
00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:31.469
like many washbasins and things.

735
00:31:32.819 --> 00:31:33.910
You can build something like that.

736
00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:35.510
They can come for when you come to India,

737
00:31:35.589 --> 00:31:37.930
have a look at the plans of the school that mothers that I'd love to.

738
00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:38.810
Something like that

739
00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:44.630
so that so many people are there,

740
00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:44.930
you see,

741
00:31:44.949 --> 00:31:46.939
the more you come in contact with each other,

742
00:31:47.109 --> 00:31:48.189
it will be a real outing.

743
00:31:48.229 --> 00:31:49.510
You can have your programmes,

744
00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:50.109
you can have.

745
00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:52.329
It would be wonderful.

746
00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:53.790
Everybody would like to be there.

747
00:31:54.439 --> 00:31:55.760
Because when we get together now,

748
00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:56.040
Mother,

749
00:31:56.119 --> 00:31:57.439
we have a problem with space.

750
00:31:57.479 --> 00:32:00.910
We just burst at the seams and we're growing so quick.

751
00:32:02.239 --> 00:32:04.040
And you are going to grow very fast

752
00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:07.510
because most of the gurus have withdrawn from there.

753
00:32:07.949 --> 00:32:09.089
You're going to grow very fast.

754
00:32:09.189 --> 00:32:10.459
You must have a big hall.

755
00:32:11.319 --> 00:32:14.119
You can make yourself a hall of your own.

756
00:32:14.319 --> 00:32:14.359
No.

757
00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:15.880
The golden builders can build it.

758
00:32:15.989 --> 00:32:16.479
That's no problem.

759
00:32:19.829 --> 00:32:20.920
It should be double story.

760
00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:21.260
Why?

761
00:32:21.479 --> 00:32:26.959
Because you can sleep and do and could be bathrooms upstairs and down below the.

762
00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:31.880
Golden builder's mother is very prosperous now thanks to your grace.

763
00:32:31.969 --> 00:32:32.239
Yes,

764
00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:33.640
tremendous.

765
00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:35.959
And people should learn from you,

766
00:32:36.199 --> 00:32:36.719
really.

767
00:32:37.089 --> 00:32:37.729
It's very good.

768
00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:41.439
They've never had so much work and

769
00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:43.400
all these things are working out,

770
00:32:43.689 --> 00:32:44.890
and they're getting all their work,

771
00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:45.069
Mother,

772
00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:46.209
in churches.

773
00:32:47.939 --> 00:32:49.349
Mainly Mormon churches.

774
00:32:49.489 --> 00:32:49.510
Mor

775
00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:54.089
Mormon Latter day saints.

776
00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:54.699
You probably,

777
00:32:54.739 --> 00:32:55.920
it's an American Mor

778
00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:57.900
nonsense.

779
00:32:57.939 --> 00:32:59.969
It's an American boish business

780
00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:02.290
where they believe that Jesus Christ.

781
00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:04.569
was born in America,

782
00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:06.079
I mean.

783
00:33:07.589 --> 00:33:07.619
Yes they do,

784
00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:10.609
and they're very,

785
00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:11.989
they're quite big in Australia.

786
00:33:19.609 --> 00:33:24.089
The headquarters is in Salt Lake City and uh and they're very,

787
00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:24.739
very big.

788
00:33:24.859 --> 00:33:25.079
They,

789
00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:26.810
they're big on family life.

790
00:33:27.849 --> 00:33:28.719
Actually

791
00:33:28.969 --> 00:33:30.410
many of their things are dynamic,

792
00:33:30.449 --> 00:33:32.290
but they're completely wrong about them.

793
00:33:32.729 --> 00:33:34.969
What is the need to have Christ born in America?

794
00:33:35.089 --> 00:33:35.150
Well,

795
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:36.599
I guess it's a bit of ego.

796
00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:45.550
a man called Joseph Smith had a revelation and he found it on

797
00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:48.430
certain tablets that was written on a

798
00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:50.359
mountain somewhere near Washington these tablets.

799
00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:59.300
They say the founder of the movement discovered tablets,

800
00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:00.000
you know,

801
00:34:00.229 --> 00:34:01.339
large stone

802
00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:07.219
stones with writing on declaring that Jesus was born in America.

803
00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:08.000
Well,

804
00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:13.080
who wrote that English language that Joseph Smith,

805
00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:13.159
his name was unlikely.

806
00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:34.550
Joseph Smith,

807
00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:34.580
you know,

808
00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:34.810
good at Smith.

809
00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:01.580
In that smith means

810
00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:03.580
smith means uh smile.

811
00:35:05.719 --> 00:35:05.870
with

812
00:35:07.149 --> 00:35:08.139
But it is that not

813
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:13.580
not that one.

814
00:35:15.729 --> 00:35:15.739
Uh.

815
00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:16.810
Uh

816
00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:21.699
Marjorie Bassett we don't show.

817
00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:22.659
That's not the way.

818
00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:23.610
It's very bad,

819
00:35:23.659 --> 00:35:24.570
bad manners.

820
00:35:24.919 --> 00:35:28.520
The lady who was our publicity who was supposed to become our publicity agent

821
00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:33.040
came in and the first thing she said to Mother was that,

822
00:35:33.139 --> 00:35:33.219
well,

823
00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:35.439
we're going to have to fix up your accent.

824
00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:36.090
You

825
00:35:36.899 --> 00:35:38.070
don't speak English properly,

826
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.040
and the Americans won't have

827
00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:43.379
she said.

828
00:35:43.909 --> 00:35:45.189
Out of date now.

829
00:35:45.929 --> 00:35:46.439
So I said,

830
00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:46.770
all right,

831
00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:48.040
now how do I speak?

832
00:35:48.489 --> 00:35:49.000
He said,

833
00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:50.159
you say,

834
00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:52.439
we say thought.

835
00:35:53.699 --> 00:35:53.739
Not even that man

836
00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:03.909
don't like this.

837
00:36:03.919 --> 00:36:04.520
It's hideous thought.

838
00:36:04.689 --> 00:36:06.000
It's a much deeper way,

839
00:36:06.169 --> 00:36:08.239
thought that's the way we speak,

840
00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:10.189
not a thought.

841
00:36:17.399 --> 00:36:18.780
But this is also ego,

842
00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:19.060
you see,

843
00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.300
if it is English language,

844
00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:21.489
speak like English.

845
00:36:22.879 --> 00:36:24.590
Why should you have American English?

846
00:36:26.989 --> 00:36:30.489
This is also another ego that we can do anything to the language also,

847
00:36:31.659 --> 00:36:32.399
isn't it?

848
00:36:32.469 --> 00:36:33.899
What is the basic language,

849
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:35.020
why don't you speak like that?

850
00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:39.189
I can't understand.

851
00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:41.629
Supposing we start speaking like Hindi,

852
00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:42.879
English language,

853
00:36:42.959 --> 00:36:45.110
you won't understand a word of what we are saying.

854
00:36:46.199 --> 00:36:46.510
Hindi.

855
00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:51.949
It's not even an accent or a dialect.

856
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.399
It's absolutely careless,

857
00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:54.790
slovenly speech.

858
00:36:55.159 --> 00:37:00.399
I know that is accepted now we have our South Indians will say judged.

859
00:37:09.679 --> 00:37:09.699
Not a

860
00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:10.760
part.

861
00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:16.620
That

862
00:37:18.729 --> 00:37:20.120
But this is also ego,

863
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:20.429
you see,

864
00:37:20.469 --> 00:37:21.669
if it is English language,

865
00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:22.899
speak like English.

866
00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:25.979
Why should you have American English?

867
00:37:28.409 --> 00:37:31.949
This is also another ego that we can do anything to the language also,

868
00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:33.590
isn't it?

869
00:37:33.639 --> 00:37:35.360
If the whatever is the basic language,

870
00:37:35.479 --> 00:37:36.479
why don't you speak like.

871
00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:40.699
I can't understand.

872
00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:43.169
supposing we start speaking like Hindi,

873
00:37:43.889 --> 00:37:44.419
English language,

874
00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.649
you won't understand a word of what we are saying.

875
00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:49.139
Hi

876
00:37:50.439 --> 00:37:50.469
Hindi.

877
00:37:51.489 --> 00:37:53.560
It's not even an accent or a dialect.

878
00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:55.010
It's absolutely careless,

879
00:37:55.129 --> 00:37:56.280
slovenly speech.

880
00:37:56.810 --> 00:38:02.360
I know that is accepted now we have a say our South Indians will say judge

881
00:38:02.689 --> 00:38:03.270
judge,

882
00:38:03.649 --> 00:38:04.129
judged,

883
00:38:06.739 --> 00:38:07.830
and they will say like that they talk like.

884
00:38:09.689 --> 00:38:10.139
Like that,

885
00:38:10.179 --> 00:38:10.399
you see,

886
00:38:10.419 --> 00:38:11.370
they say like that,

887
00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:12.340
but it's all right.

888
00:38:12.379 --> 00:38:12.580
I mean,

889
00:38:12.659 --> 00:38:15.629
we know they are like that and they accept that they are like that,

890
00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:17.010
and it's wrong to say,

891
00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:18.209
but they say it like that,

892
00:38:18.239 --> 00:38:18.850
all right,

893
00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:19.969
judgement,

894
00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:22.360
they'll say judgement was not good.

895
00:38:22.979 --> 00:38:24.409
I like that they speak like that,

896
00:38:24.419 --> 00:38:25.469
and then we have

897
00:38:25.699 --> 00:38:27.580
also people like from CP province,

898
00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:28.790
they say uncle.

899
00:38:29.719 --> 00:38:30.360
They'll say a station

900
00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:44.580
is not station they'll say India India like that,

901
00:38:44.629 --> 00:38:45.870
you see they say and say I have,

902
00:38:46.139 --> 00:38:46.909
I have

903
00:38:47.679 --> 00:38:50.439
like that they have a style of school.

904
00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:53.699
So we all have that kind of thing in India.

905
00:38:53.739 --> 00:38:55.820
Even English people have their own style,

906
00:38:55.899 --> 00:38:56.649
so to speak,

907
00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:59.379
but that doesn't mean that if you have those

908
00:38:59.379 --> 00:39:03.209
things that uh main English is challenged and accepted

909
00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:05.399
to be the right thing to do that way.

910
00:39:05.659 --> 00:39:06.010
I mean,

911
00:39:06.209 --> 00:39:08.169
English must be spoken like the English,

912
00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:10.689
but now even the English don't speak like English.

913
00:39:10.739 --> 00:39:11.229
I must.

914
00:39:12.409 --> 00:39:13.439
They changed

915
00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:16.129
the way some of these people speak,

916
00:39:16.169 --> 00:39:16.929
I would say

917
00:39:17.409 --> 00:39:18.090
like that.

918
00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:20.020
Pat

919
00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:22.100
or Maureen is not right,

920
00:39:22.169 --> 00:39:23.090
she's educated,

921
00:39:23.129 --> 00:39:24.219
but Pat and

922
00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:25.719
uh Pamela,

923
00:39:26.209 --> 00:39:29.379
and sometimes the worst is uh this uh

924
00:39:29.969 --> 00:39:30.780
Tony's wife,

925
00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:31.500
what's her name?

926
00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:33.159
Dawn Dawn.

927
00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:35.169
I can't understand what she talks,

928
00:39:35.209 --> 00:39:35.500
you see,

929
00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:36.360
she's she's

930
00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:37.060
uh

931
00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.810
uh 10 times she must put R in between.

932
00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:45.610
So that's uh another uneducated style I think whatever it is.

933
00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:48.659
So they also don't speak correct English.

934
00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:49.500
True,

935
00:39:49.909 --> 00:39:50.659
isn't it?

936
00:39:51.149 --> 00:39:52.310
But on the whole and

937
00:39:52.429 --> 00:39:55.709
and Scottish and the Welsh and all other Scottish is I don't know absolutely

938
00:40:02.699 --> 00:40:03.820
I Scottish hero Mr.

939
00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:04.669
Mark Canahan.

940
00:40:04.949 --> 00:40:05.810
I told him now,

941
00:40:05.889 --> 00:40:08.439
will you please speak write English to me.

942
00:40:08.689 --> 00:40:09.360
I can't understand.

943
00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:09.760
I'm really,

944
00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:11.360
and that is one thing about me.

945
00:40:11.649 --> 00:40:15.689
I cannot understand any language which is so much mispronounced.

946
00:40:17.129 --> 00:40:21.979
So American is absolutely out of question that way Canadians are good people,

947
00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:22.260
you know,

948
00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:23.080
and also

949
00:40:23.699 --> 00:40:24.389
uh Australians,

950
00:40:24.399 --> 00:40:25.629
they have not changed the language,

951
00:40:25.709 --> 00:40:26.419
so.

952
00:40:28.179 --> 00:40:28.689
But

953
00:40:28.879 --> 00:40:29.639
Americans and they,

954
00:40:29.719 --> 00:40:33.560
they want to teach you how to speak English of all the persons.

955
00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:35.239
That was amazing that morning.

956
00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:36.919
I couldn't believe what was happening.

957
00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:39.719
I said she's never had this happen before.

958
00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:40.870
What are you talking about?

959
00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:42.320
She said,

960
00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:42.479
well,

961
00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:43.320
we've got to change it.

962
00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:44.320
It's just got to be you.

963
00:40:44.479 --> 00:40:45.760
Nobody will understand you.

964
00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:46.870
And I mean,

965
00:40:46.989 --> 00:40:48.729
everybody understands what you say.

966
00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:53.389
But uh she she told me the answer.

967
00:40:53.469 --> 00:40:53.750
She said,

968
00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:56.610
you see Americans is a Humphrey Bogart style.

969
00:40:56.949 --> 00:40:56.969
She said,

970
00:40:56.979 --> 00:40:57.000
she said,

971
00:40:59.949 --> 00:41:00.260
uh,

972
00:41:00.389 --> 00:41:02.760
you put a cigarette in one side,

973
00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:03.810
then you have to.

974
00:41:06.014 --> 00:41:07.054
Putting these sides out from the other side,

975
00:41:09.245 --> 00:41:10.834
so they're used to that kind of thing.

976
00:41:10.925 --> 00:41:12.125
She made a thing like that,

977
00:41:12.195 --> 00:41:12.524
you see,

978
00:41:12.604 --> 00:41:15.205
she closed here and opened this side the thing,

979
00:41:15.245 --> 00:41:15.385
you see this.

980
00:41:17.834 --> 00:41:19.044
I was quite surprised to

981
00:41:22.205 --> 00:41:23.314
not speak like that.

982
00:41:23.554 --> 00:41:26.354
So you have to speak from one side or from the other side.

983
00:41:27.649 --> 00:41:27.659
Hm.

984
00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.159
That's why the language became like that.

985
00:41:33.129 --> 00:41:33.919
Best was Praha.

986
00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:36.679
He was teaching some

987
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:37.590
people,

988
00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:38.290
Americans,

989
00:41:38.409 --> 00:41:39.959
how to say Bhagavati.

990
00:41:40.409 --> 00:41:40.929
They couldn't say

991
00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:41.610
Bhagavati,

992
00:41:41.629 --> 00:41:41.810
he said.

993
00:41:42.850 --> 00:41:44.330
Then he said pull his ears,

994
00:41:44.459 --> 00:41:44.959
you see,

995
00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:45.989
before me.

996
00:41:46.229 --> 00:41:46.479
He said,

997
00:41:46.489 --> 00:41:46.729
Mother,

998
00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:47.370
please forgive me.

999
00:41:47.409 --> 00:41:48.290
I have to teach them,

1000
00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:50.820
so I have to use some sort of another style.

1001
00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:51.989
So they use it with children,

1002
00:41:52.169 --> 00:41:52.719
she said,

1003
00:41:52.889 --> 00:41:53.139
All right,

1004
00:41:53.209 --> 00:41:54.709
said hagawati.

1005
00:41:56.169 --> 00:41:56.179
I

1006
00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:01.570
And they did say oh God.

1007
00:42:08.469 --> 00:42:09.379
It's interesting,

1008
00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:09.820
yeah,

1009
00:42:09.899 --> 00:42:11.020
but this ego will go away,

1010
00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:13.139
I think they'll pick up the proper languages.

1011
00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:20.889
And English has spoiled also not like

1012
00:42:21.219 --> 00:42:21.500
yeah,

1013
00:42:21.699 --> 00:42:22.669
these.

1014
00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:24.590
Cambridge people,

1015
00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:25.510
they'll say super

1016
00:42:26.719 --> 00:42:27.850
meaning super

1017
00:42:29.219 --> 00:42:29.929
super

1018
00:42:30.209 --> 00:42:31.469
super

1019
00:42:31.659 --> 00:42:31.739
super.

1020
00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:33.770
if it is to be said super

1021
00:42:33.979 --> 00:42:34.790
they'll say super

1022
00:42:37.659 --> 00:42:37.669
super.

1023
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:43.010
R.

1024
00:42:43.459 --> 00:42:44.699
What is that?

1025
00:42:47.239 --> 00:42:50.199
think very lady it's the sort of way they speak,

1026
00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:50.699
you know,

1027
00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:51.770
it's very sort of they,

1028
00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:54.780
they exaggerate all the uh

1029
00:42:55.449 --> 00:42:57.800
all the uh vowels,

1030
00:42:57.929 --> 00:42:59.860
all the vowels are exaggerated.

1031
00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:09.879
they say they say you are mild.

1032
00:43:12.489 --> 00:43:12.500
That

1033
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:13.820
It was our

1034
00:43:17.459 --> 00:43:17.879
our uh

1035
00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:19.100
uh this uh with uh.

1036
00:43:20.169 --> 00:43:23.030
in the mouth like I wish there's something round

1037
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:25.290
in the mouth a ball in the mouth like that

1038
00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:26.320
in the public school,

1039
00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:26.959
you see our doctor Spiro,

1040
00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.100
he used to speak like that.

1041
00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:33.139
So one day

1042
00:43:49.129 --> 00:43:49.169
the son said,

1043
00:43:49.179 --> 00:43:49.399
take out that ball from your mouth and now he's more the oh no not really no,

1044
00:43:49.409 --> 00:43:49.429
definitely not.

1045
00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:49.530
David.

1046
00:43:49.739 --> 00:43:49.750
now

1047
00:43:50.889 --> 00:43:52.530
he's more sort of around.

1048
00:43:52.689 --> 00:43:54.080
He goes round in the mouth,

1049
00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:57.000
but he says that's how they're taught in the public schools,

1050
00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:57.889
it's true.

1051
00:43:59.169 --> 00:44:00.919
Rustam's got a very beautiful accent.

1052
00:44:01.189 --> 00:44:01.199
No,

1053
00:44:01.209 --> 00:44:01.219
no,

1054
00:44:01.229 --> 00:44:01.239
no,

1055
00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:01.429
I mean he's told me that I went to indoor indoor.

1056
00:44:18.479 --> 00:44:18.530
I said indoor.

1057
00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:18.580
What do you mean?

1058
00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:18.679
He went to indoor indoor.

1059
00:44:18.689 --> 00:44:20.909
I think because I'm very bad as you say I'm so hopeless.

1060
00:44:20.989 --> 00:44:21.899
I have no brains

1061
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:24.209
so my.

1062
00:44:24.959 --> 00:44:26.550
My granddaughter came and said,

1063
00:44:26.719 --> 00:44:27.070
Ronny,

1064
00:44:27.199 --> 00:44:29.629
he's saying he went to indoor.

1065
00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.310
I said indoor?

1066
00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:31.560
Yes,

1067
00:44:31.679 --> 00:44:33.110
I said indoor.

1068
00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:35.310
I said you're saying indoor.

1069
00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:35.949
I thought,

1070
00:44:35.959 --> 00:44:41.239
how can you go to indoor either in or to one of the propositions.

1071
00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:44.979
But

1072
00:44:48.149 --> 00:44:49.709
But it is indoor,

1073
00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:50.100
the,

1074
00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:50.810
the,

1075
00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:53.719
as we said THE the indoor,

1076
00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:57.199
but he said indoor.

1077
00:44:58.110 --> 00:44:59.449
And I couldn't understand how it is in English.

1078
00:44:59.489 --> 00:44:59.560
I thought I N D O R,

1079
00:44:59.570 --> 00:44:59.590
he said

1080
00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:11.750
it is indoor,

1081
00:45:11.899 --> 00:45:11.909
the

1082
00:45:21.449 --> 00:45:21.459
the,

1083
00:45:21.469 --> 00:45:21.530
as you say indoor,

1084
00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:22.649
not the as you say what do you say to THE.

1085
00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:23.600
This is the,

1086
00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:23.620
the,

1087
00:45:23.629 --> 00:45:23.699
the book that's where the

1088
00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:27.300
the

1089
00:45:31.439 --> 00:45:31.449
the.

1090
00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:32.629
The,

1091
00:45:32.679 --> 00:45:34.989
the,

1092
00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:35.030
he said.

1093
00:45:41.469 --> 00:45:41.479
See,

1094
00:45:43.429 --> 00:45:44.219
it's a lot different.

1095
00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:47.580
But Mother,

1096
00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:49.530
the people who speak beautiful Hindi

1097
00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:53.370
who were at your programme in Delhi and they heard you speaking one night.

1098
00:45:53.989 --> 00:45:56.689
They were pundits from the university teachers.

1099
00:45:57.020 --> 00:46:00.899
They came out absolutely saying that for somebody who

1100
00:46:01.419 --> 00:46:03.689
speaks Maratti so perfectly.

1101
00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:05.229
But who speaks

1102
00:46:05.469 --> 00:46:06.060
Hindi

1103
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:07.979
with such not only perfection.

1104
00:46:09.429 --> 00:46:09.590
Yes,

1105
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:11.350
they think you're a scholar of Hindi,

1106
00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:13.620
and they said the pronunciation is flawless.

1107
00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:15.020
They used the word flawless.

1108
00:46:16.379 --> 00:46:16.530
Yeah,

1109
00:46:16.689 --> 00:46:19.719
somehow Hindi I know because I've spoken it in many lives

1110
00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:21.169
and Sanskrit,

1111
00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:22.000
that's how I know.

1112
00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:23.929
and Marathi I know very well.

1113
00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:26.870
We just enjoy the vibrations Marathi I'm very good at it.

1114
00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:30.889
I think Marathi language itself is very powerful and Hindi is second,

1115
00:46:30.929 --> 00:46:32.959
but English I can manage somehow.

1116
00:46:34.850 --> 00:46:36.449
English is not so good as Marathi.

1117
00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:38.500
I cannot be.

1118
00:46:38.879 --> 00:46:42.429
I think it's very difficult to be humorous in the language and you're very

1119
00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:43.989
humorous with English,

1120
00:46:45.209 --> 00:46:49.239
English can be such a dry language English can be so dry,

1121
00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:50.429
but you make it so

1122
00:46:53.149 --> 00:46:53.189
jovial.

1123
00:46:53.219 --> 00:46:54.149
One day was giggling out,

1124
00:46:54.199 --> 00:46:54.439
I said,

1125
00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:55.120
what happened?

1126
00:46:55.239 --> 00:46:57.080
the way you joked at our

1127
00:46:57.439 --> 00:47:01.830
unions that now the surgeries are forming labour unions.

1128
00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:05.270
Hm

1129
00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:07.679
All right.

1130
00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:10.429
We had a nice time together.

1131
00:47:10.679 --> 00:47:11.439
Thank you very much.

1132
00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:13.510
I hope you all enjoyed the vibrations.

1133
00:47:13.919 --> 00:47:14.560
Thank you very much.

1134
00:47:14.719 --> 00:47:15.489
May God bless you.

1135
00:47:16.199 --> 00:47:17.389
So tomorrow morning,

1136
00:47:17.479 --> 00:47:17.989
what time?

1137
00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:18.439
No,

1138
00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:21.280
unless you want to do something else I want to go

1139
00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:26.810
shopping because I want to see what is left and what I have to get.

1140
00:47:27.719 --> 00:47:29.360
I'm borrowing back all the presents,

1141
00:47:29.399 --> 00:47:29.790
you know.

1142
00:47:30.054 --> 00:47:32.004
In the afternoon we have one thing in the afternoon,

1143
00:47:32.044 --> 00:47:34.445
that's all just a radio interview.

1144
00:47:35.165 --> 00:47:36.965
That is a later in the afternoon that's tomorrow.

1145
00:47:40.004 --> 00:47:43.965
So tomorrow morning I'll have the bath with all the elaborations because I

1146
00:47:43.965 --> 00:47:46.844
was quite nervous to see the way you have made all the elaborations.

1147
00:47:46.925 --> 00:47:48.195
There's no need to bother.

1148
00:47:48.524 --> 00:47:50.014
You should have just filled the tank,

1149
00:47:50.044 --> 00:47:50.955
I would have jumped into.

1150
00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:56.030
Mhm

1151
00:47:57.479 --> 00:47:59.879
The only thing to get out of it will be difficult.

1152
00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:01.820
Yeah

1153
00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:04.419
Typical.

1154
00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:07.469
Architect,

1155
00:48:07.689 --> 00:48:09.629
he must be enjoying that part for the architect.

1156
00:48:14.649 --> 00:48:17.879
By myself I made you see two bathrooms like that in my house,

1157
00:48:18.449 --> 00:48:19.570
but huge big like this,

1158
00:48:19.649 --> 00:48:20.330
you see,

1159
00:48:20.649 --> 00:48:22.290
and you can get down by steps,

1160
00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:23.280
it's like a tag.

1161
00:48:26.739 --> 00:48:29.739
And we also use like ordinary bathroom.

1162
00:48:30.699 --> 00:48:31.000
Uh,

1163
00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:33.510
like you can just get down and have a shower there.

1164
00:48:34.169 --> 00:48:34.949
Or if you want,

1165
00:48:34.979 --> 00:48:38.959
you can feel in the water as much as you like and have a bath exactly because

1166
00:48:38.959 --> 00:48:42.139
Indians don't eat that have baths of that kind

1167
00:48:42.139 --> 00:48:44.229
they like shower so you can have a bucket

1168
00:48:44.469 --> 00:48:45.629
and sit on the

1169
00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:48.639
uh on the staircase in the stairs and

1170
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.149
take the bath,

1171
00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:52.239
which will be like lots of things.

1172
00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:53.270
It's Japanese style.

1173
00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:56.550
Romans but Japanese,

1174
00:48:56.629 --> 00:48:58.540
you have very very funny people.

1175
00:48:59.080 --> 00:48:59.909
They give you buckets,

1176
00:48:59.949 --> 00:49:01.659
you see that will be 56,

1177
00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:06.060
Buckets and 56 stacks.

1178
00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:10.790
And you have to first wash under that all of you put together,

1179
00:49:11.159 --> 00:49:13.909
and there's a common tub into which you have to get it.

1180
00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:16.399
It's a horrible thing.

1181
00:49:17.429 --> 00:49:17.879
Really.

1182
00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:25.939
Japan may be the last.

1183
00:49:28.939 --> 00:49:31.830
That's so it's better because already so many patients have got sterilisation.

1184
00:49:32.989 --> 00:49:34.899
So I don't know what's going to happen to Japan.

1185
00:49:35.909 --> 00:49:36.080
All right,

1186
00:49:36.129 --> 00:49:37.959
we got this with your mahakari

1187
00:49:40.070 --> 00:49:40.080
thing,

1188
00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:40.110
huh.

1189
00:49:41.129 --> 00:49:42.850
I got really got caught there.

1190
00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:43.370
Uh,

1191
00:49:43.419 --> 00:49:44.760
this is the big one you got,

1192
00:49:44.889 --> 00:49:45.330
right?

1193
00:49:46.459 --> 00:49:46.739
Oh,

1194
00:49:46.899 --> 00:49:48.800
I've got some smaller ones like this.

1195
00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:51.780
We can give it to these people on the food.

1196
00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:52.820
I'll give them.

1197
00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:53.800
I've got some.

1198
00:49:54.419 --> 00:49:55.629
This one is wonderful.

1199
00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:56.780
You people gave them,

1200
00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:57.179
right?

1201
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.929
It's huge.

1202
00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:00.439
Such vibration

1203
00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:04.540
That was our very first puja when you arrived in Australia,

1204
00:50:05.419 --> 00:50:08.560
and we got these flowers just out of the blue.

1205
00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:12.000
We didn't know that they were auspicious and we went and just got them.

1206
00:50:12.219 --> 00:50:14.290
You know what happened when I was going?

1207
00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:16.139
I told who Terrence was driving.

1208
00:50:16.669 --> 00:50:17.020
I said,

1209
00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:17.659
stop the car.

1210
00:50:17.739 --> 00:50:19.060
We have to get these flowers,

1211
00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:19.649
you see.

1212
00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:22.189
And then we went around and he forgot about it.

1213
00:50:22.219 --> 00:50:23.520
I also forgot when we went there,

1214
00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:24.239
you got all these.

1215
00:50:26.189 --> 00:50:26.199
Yeah.

1216
00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:29.219
They are the things meant for the school.

1217
00:50:29.649 --> 00:50:33.530
It's tremendous this food out and you can see the face and all that so withdrawn.

1218
00:50:34.669 --> 00:50:35.149
Just funny.

1219
00:50:35.189 --> 00:50:37.300
It's so powerful.

1220
00:50:40.659 --> 00:50:41.429
Tremendous,

1221
00:50:41.739 --> 00:50:42.199
it's beautiful.

1222
00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:43.820
That's a good one.

1223
00:50:44.439 --> 00:50:45.570
That's out of the one you.

1224
00:50:48.090 --> 00:50:49.379
And that's the one that

1225
00:50:49.629 --> 00:50:50.830
was taken in by Turner.

1226
00:50:51.929 --> 00:50:53.959
Is it this year?

1227
00:50:54.169 --> 00:50:54.370
No,

1228
00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:57.520
the year before last and we brought it to India as a gift for

1229
00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:00.600
year before last year.

1230
00:51:01.399 --> 00:51:03.080
I turn 12 months before.

1231
00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:07.360

00:51:07.590 --> 00:51:08.370

00:51:08.379 --> 00:51:08.389

1234
00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:11.379
yeah that was another luck they had.

1235
00:51:11.459 --> 00:51:12.820
I know blue and red.

1236
00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:14.260
I know where they got it,

1237
00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:15.219
yes.

1238
00:51:18.189 --> 00:51:18.500
All right.

1239
00:51:22.399 --> 00:51:23.229
So you buy sweet leaves.

1240
00:51:23.439 --> 00:51:25.709
I will name him on the day of our food,

1241
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:26.419

1242
00:51:28.889 --> 00:51:28.919

Thank you.

Oh working it out very much.

Ibiscus.

1249
00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:45.479
I think he's still a bit hungry.

1250
00:51:45.649 --> 00:51:45.800
No,

1251
00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:48.770
he's he's with the gas.

1252
00:51:49.649 --> 00:51:50.030
That's

1253
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:52.469
You're hungry.

1254
00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:54.169
Also there is gas.

1255
00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:54.340
OK,

00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:55.550

OK.

Yeah.
