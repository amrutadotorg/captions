00:00:02.436 --> 00:00:15.010
The Nabhi chakra, is placed at the centre
of gravity, of every human being.

00:00:16.114 --> 00:00:20.738
If it is not there,

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:31.532
 that means it is going to be a little problem,

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.679
 for you to get it in its right place.

00:00:43.607 --> 00:00:56.712
There is a kind of a trouble which most of you suffer from,

00:00:59.783 --> 00:01:09.362
 is maybe due to drugs or maybe nervous problems, due to war,

00:01:09.712 --> 00:01:16.783
or maybe some sort of a shock to your sustenance.

00:01:30.034 --> 00:01:40.527
For example, during war, people lost their values,

00:01:41.495 --> 00:01:47.870
because, they lost faith in God.

00:01:56.528 --> 00:02:09.410
Chaste women who believed in chastity,
 were brutally assaulted.

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:25.671
Very religious people, were persecuted,

00:02:30.552 --> 00:02:35.208
 families were broken,

00:02:39.502 --> 00:02:43.899
many men were killed,

00:02:45.422 --> 00:02:56.863
 and children, women, and old people, were scattered.

00:03:02.895 --> 00:03:08.510
A very horrible atmosphere of insecurity,

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:17.735
overpowered all these nations.

00:03:22.918 --> 00:03:27.102
Then came the concentration camps, you see, also,

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:37.283
which shattered human beings,

00:03:39.842 --> 00:03:47.581
because human beings are very delicate instruments.

00:03:52.263 --> 00:04:00.411
They are the coveted creations, they are the highest

00:04:03.828 --> 00:04:11.597
and they were dominated by things like bombs,
which are matter.

00:04:21.841 --> 00:04:30.875
Thus, the Spirit in man, died out.

00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:43.573
People lost faith in righteousness, in love.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:00.459
Then a new pattern of securities were built up.

00:05:07.078 --> 00:05:13.935
The industrial revolution followed it, as a result

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:32.580
 and the artificial sense of joy, of security, of love,

00:05:35.223 --> 00:05:39.706
was accepted by the society.

00:05:46.775 --> 00:05:50.184
This is what man did with his freedom,

00:05:50.644 --> 00:05:58.506
because wars are created by man, this is not Godâ€™s doing.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:23.845
But along with it, very great seeking souls,
took their birth on this Earth.

00:06:37.004 --> 00:06:51.043
They started seeking beyond these artificial
securities, like materialism.

00:07:08.377 --> 00:07:13.589
The seekers had no proper leaders,

00:07:17.581 --> 00:07:22.114
to organize them,

00:07:25.566 --> 00:07:28.788
 and to lead them to the right path.

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:45.999
So the mistakes committed by them, 
created a hurdle.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.432
So, apart from the hurdles of human awareness,

00:07:58.655 --> 00:08:02.940
so many other hurdles were added.

00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:16.907
So many other hurdles were added,
which made Sahaja Yoga a difficult process for them.

00:08:39.432 --> 00:08:49.982
The countries who took part in the war, only
became the developed countries.

00:08:50.704 --> 00:08:55.149
As a reaction, no its a reaction, they are
the only developed people,

00:08:56.151 --> 00:09:01.847
who are actually taking part in the war.

00:09:02.071 --> 00:09:06.870
And those who did not, are underdeveloped.

00:09:18.714 --> 00:09:30.208
So, on one side, we have countries, 
who are trying to seek,

00:09:30.922 --> 00:09:39.443
because they are overdeveloped, because they are affluent,

00:09:44.982 --> 00:09:51.280
 but their seekers have lost their moorings,

00:09:56.454 --> 00:10:01.660
 because of anti-feeling.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:12.168
Alright?

00:10:13.985 --> 00:10:18.305
While other countries are not yet developed,

00:10:19.846 --> 00:10:27.305
so the seekers there, are still seeking in money.

00:10:42.853 --> 00:10:50.819
At this juncture, Sahaja Yoga was found out, this was the stage

00:11:01.591 --> 00:11:12.013
 by which the promised union of human awareness with God is established,

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:24.025
 through which you feel your unconscious,

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:35.163
the Power of God, which is All-pervading,

00:11:36.963 --> 00:11:42.933
which thinks, organizes, and plans.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:00.012
Only through Kundalini Yoga of Sahaja,

00:12:00.132 --> 00:12:04.989
Sahaja Kundalini Yoga, only through Sahaja Kundalini Yoga,

00:12:05.314 --> 00:12:10.634
 human beings are going to evolve.

00:12:21.809 --> 00:12:25.839
But those who are going to evolve,

00:12:29.205 --> 00:12:33.213
have to have their dharma intact.
