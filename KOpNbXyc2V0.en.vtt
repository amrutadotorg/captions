00:06:39.396 --> 00:06:42.906
Ah, this song was especially for the Iranians

00:06:42.916 --> 00:06:46.596
and for the Turkish people.

00:06:46.598 --> 00:06:49.984
Especially! It says that, "O Mother keep me

00:06:49.991 --> 00:06:52.491
in Your protection."

00:06:52.491 --> 00:06:55.840
And the whole thing is so beautifully made up

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.446
out of that feeling music. It is very remarkable

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.296
how these people have done this.

00:07:03.296 --> 00:07:05.796
Give them a hand.

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:31.069
Could we have a few helpers, Bogdhan, Russell?

00:07:31.072 --> 00:07:34.922
Anybody who knows 'Shankara Bhole Bhale.'

00:07:34.925 --> 00:07:37.425
Everybody.

00:39:22.194 --> 00:39:25.939
The next item is an arrangement of Vinati Suniye.

00:44:15.905 --> 00:44:18.405
So the next item on our programme tonight is

00:44:18.405 --> 00:44:23.105
a traditional dance from Thailand

00:44:23.136 --> 00:44:25.636
called Serng Isan.

00:50:00.093 --> 00:50:03.503
This dance was from the North East part of Thailand,

00:50:03.503 --> 00:50:07.723
which is a dry farming area and this is a popular dance

00:50:07.735 --> 00:50:11.021
that at harvest time,

00:50:11.017 --> 00:50:15.371
the girls carry, in the basket, inside, glutenous rice

00:50:15.371 --> 00:50:18.440
is to feed the workers in the field and spread

00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:20.940
the joy of the harvest.

00:50:56.894 --> 00:51:04.727
Our next item is a song from the Malaysian Collective

00:51:04.727 --> 00:51:07.227
and the music is from a Chinese melody

00:51:07.227 --> 00:51:10.717
from a mandarin song and it is called,

00:51:10.692 --> 00:51:13.192
"Moon Represents My Heart."

00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:48.070
We now have a traditional dance, a Malaysian dance,

00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:50.580
called, 'Joget.'

01:01:07.082 --> 01:01:10.499
The next item on the programme is a song

01:01:10.502 --> 01:01:13.253
which will be performed by the Japanese,

01:01:13.293 --> 01:01:15.793
a Japanese song.

01:01:26.782 --> 01:01:29.162
Shri Mataji with Your permission,

01:01:29.162 --> 01:01:32.892
which is a dry farming area and this is a popular dance

01:01:32.912 --> 01:01:38.262
and Casko will give a brief translation of these songs.

01:01:44.842 --> 01:01:48.316
The first song is about the Spring.

01:01:48.316 --> 01:01:56.462
In the Spring, people get on the boat and
they enjoy the scenery of the Spring

01:01:56.447 --> 01:02:01.667
and this song is about the beauty of the nature of the Spring time.

01:02:01.677 --> 01:02:07.787
And the next song is the song of the Autumn.

01:02:08.528 --> 01:02:13.947
And then all the leaves of the
trees are changing the colours

01:02:13.947 --> 01:02:16.447
green and the yellow and red.

01:02:16.447 --> 01:02:21.753
And this song is the beauty of the Autumn.

01:07:48.965 --> 01:07:53.900
The next item is a play and it is entitled, "The First People."

01:07:53.891 --> 01:07:58.650
The play was written by Brian Bell, from New Zealand.

01:08:01.653 --> 01:08:02.882
He's not here.

01:08:05.092 --> 01:08:10.962
The piece tells the story of the first people who evolved the world over.

01:08:10.974 --> 01:08:31.735
Our story is told through the eyes of the indigenous people of Australia and relates something of their beliefs, as viewed through the eyes of a Sahaji Yogi. Yet is could also be the story of the Zulu and the Thembu, the Navajo and the Mohican, the Incan and the Mayan.

01:08:31.799 --> 01:08:46.635
Those who commonly saw the Earth as precious and who communed with the Spirit of God in the natural surroundings; for they were part of the Earth and it was part of them.

01:08:46.658 --> 01:09:29.913
It is also the story of the clash between the traditions of people, who saw all belonging to the same family, with those who wished only to conquer and to whom little was sacred.
We conclude with a desire for the dawn of the Age, when all will be reconciled. For it is the birthright of all people to have freedom to seek, to be truly free. Then we may all be brothers and sisters worshipping the One, God, Shri Adi Shakti Nirmala Devi. Jai Shri Mataji!

01:10:23.254 --> 01:10:25.093
Well G'day!

01:10:26.315 --> 01:10:31.103
Looks like a different bunch of birth fellas
here to what we're used to in our place.

01:10:32.538 --> 01:10:35.038
Do you know what G'day means?

01:10:35.038 --> 01:10:39.146
It means 'hello.' 'Nice to see you.'

01:10:39.173 --> 01:10:43.931
'Hope that you are having a good
day,' all at the same time.

01:10:43.938 --> 01:10:47.995
We say it to family and to strangers alike,

01:10:47.995 --> 01:10:52.455
because we are all connected. You and me!

01:10:53.710 --> 01:10:56.210
So, G'day to all you Earth fellas.

01:10:56.219 --> 01:10:57.150
G'day

01:10:57.152 --> 01:10:59.652
G'day, G'day!

01:11:03.145 --> 01:11:10.385
They asked us to say a few words about
the country, the place we call Australia.

01:11:10.411 --> 01:11:14.101
What is means to us, who were there long ago.

01:11:14.101 --> 01:11:16.601
Long before white people,

01:11:16.599 --> 01:11:19.099
long before anyone from the North cast their eyes on our great South Land.

01:11:23.538 --> 01:11:26.038
We're an old people,

01:11:26.038 --> 01:11:29.113
an ancient people.

01:11:29.133 --> 01:11:33.208
They call us aborigines, but that's not our name.

01:11:33.229 --> 01:11:36.858
That's not our true name.

01:11:36.849 --> 01:11:41.608
Where we come from, no one knows.

01:11:41.614 --> 01:11:45.095
Some say we were the first people.

01:11:45.108 --> 01:11:50.365
Of ourselves, we say we came from nowhere.

01:11:50.383 --> 01:11:53.023
We've always been here.

01:11:53.033 --> 01:12:01.083
Us and our timeless land have been and are one.

01:12:01.091 --> 01:12:11.480
They asked us to say a few words.  I don't know what a few words really means, but let us see how it all unfolds.

01:12:11.503 --> 01:12:16.803
Now come and sit down.  Imagine you're in our country now;

01:12:16.817 --> 01:12:21.553
the red land, the timeless land.

01:12:21.563 --> 01:12:25.923
The oldest, unchanged place on this Mother Earth.

01:12:25.933 --> 01:12:32.733
It has the oldest soils, the oldest
flowing rivers and the oldest tribes.

01:12:35.283 --> 01:12:39.593
This is our land, our island home.

01:12:41.001 --> 01:12:43.501
We are different, you and me.

01:12:44.323 --> 01:12:48.793
The ways of white people and us are different;

01:12:48.802 --> 01:12:51.603
like two rivers that never meet

01:12:51.603 --> 01:12:54.412
and never mix their waters.

01:12:54.420 --> 01:13:02.018
We are different. We say that the Earth is Our Mother.

01:13:02.032 --> 01:13:08.683
We cannot own Her. She owns us, gives us life.

01:13:08.703 --> 01:13:11.203
We worship the Mother Earth.

01:13:11.198 --> 01:13:15.243
The sacred places are all around.  If you can feel them,

01:13:15.264 --> 01:13:18.463
if you know where to look and how to look.

01:13:19.742 --> 01:13:22.572
It is from the sacred places of my people,

01:13:22.572 --> 01:13:26.822
we get the strength of the Earth Mother;

01:13:26.830 --> 01:13:30.262
that All Powerful Earth Mother.

01:13:32.334 --> 01:13:36.252
Now it is said, that these times are ones of change.

01:13:38.778 --> 01:13:46.360
They say, in this Age, there are also some white people who gather together and revere the Mother Earth.

01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:53.490
They also gather together from far off
places and worship the Holy Mother together

01:13:53.483 --> 01:13:57.893
and gain strength from that meeting,

01:13:57.892 --> 01:14:01.783
who know the sacred places and sing the holy words.

01:14:03.752 --> 01:14:06.663
This is good.  This is very good.

01:14:06.670 --> 01:14:10.782
So the ways of Truth should always be followed.

01:14:13.018 --> 01:14:23.227
These are special times for it is in this time, when the dreaming of white people, of black people, of all people

01:14:23.257 --> 01:14:28.123
must be as one, like the joining of all great rivers

01:14:28.123 --> 01:14:30.623
into the one great sea.

01:14:31.261 --> 01:14:39.170
For our people, all the rocks are alive with the
spirit of the Mother Earth. Her power is there,

01:14:39.191 --> 01:14:46.968
inside the rocks, within the earth
and it protects us, all of us.

01:14:46.959 --> 01:14:51.509
They are Her and She is them.

01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:55.079
For our people, the Earth is what you call a temple,

01:14:55.077 --> 01:14:57.577
a place of reverence.

01:14:58.848 --> 01:15:05.948
Since the beginning of creation, in the time that we know as the Dreaming, the Earth has give us shelter

01:15:06.019 --> 01:15:13.003
from the heat, a place to paint,
a place to dance the sacred dance,

01:15:13.001 --> 01:15:18.333
a place to commune with the Almighty
Spirit, who is the source of all that was

01:15:18.352 --> 01:15:20.852
and all that will ever be.

01:15:24.429 --> 01:15:26.929
In the fury of the dreaming we can see the Master's hand

01:15:26.929 --> 01:15:29.472
in every corner of the land

01:15:29.516 --> 01:15:33.580
in every leaf that stirs and in every grain of sand.

01:15:33.615 --> 01:15:36.115
She put Her Son in the sky to mark time

01:15:36.115 --> 01:15:39.324
to dig down upon the land, to light our way

01:15:39.342 --> 01:15:42.814
to ease the pain of our separation and

01:15:42.814 --> 01:15:46.554
to help remind us of whence we came.

01:15:47.145 --> 01:15:51.470
One by one, our people began to follow the sun

01:15:51.499 --> 01:15:54.959
until we were as one.

01:15:54.979 --> 01:15:59.029
We stirred the sacred dust of this land with our bare feet

01:15:59.049 --> 01:16:03.118
and never did we lay our feet upon the Sacred Uluru.

01:16:03.107 --> 01:16:05.577
We danced by the sea.

01:16:05.587 --> 01:16:07.487
We danced by the shore.

01:16:07.487 --> 01:16:15.327
We sang our songs and for countless
ages we lived in peace with the land.

01:16:15.347 --> 01:16:17.847
How do people repay such gifts?

01:16:19.112 --> 01:16:24.372
By worship, through respect and
reverence for all that is around us,

01:16:24.381 --> 01:16:26.881
by protecting the land

01:16:26.881 --> 01:16:32.542
and this we have done for thousands of
years, in sacred covenant with Our Mother.

01:16:35.894 --> 01:16:42.411
We believe this land is the home of the dreaming,

01:16:42.451 --> 01:16:54.427
the time of creation and the powers which created our land came and painted themselves on this land,

01:16:54.428 --> 01:17:04.567
so that people could meet together, grow strong and give this strength back into the world.

01:17:06.513 --> 01:17:13.341
Our totem is the Rainbow Serpent;
the giver and taker of life.

01:17:13.363 --> 01:17:17.501
She has many different names, that wise one.

01:17:19.091 --> 01:17:27.178
It is said, that when the spirits of people have been made strong, She will come back to this Earth.

01:17:27.184 --> 01:17:31.281
We've waited for that day, but white people came and took our place

01:17:31.315 --> 01:17:34.925
and like a great storm that rises up out of the sea

01:17:34.930 --> 01:17:40.308
has flown over the land and
scattered my people in the wind.

01:17:40.338 --> 01:17:42.838
Now, we are no longer strong.

01:17:42.838 --> 01:17:46.148
We are too tired from fighting time,

01:17:46.148 --> 01:17:48.648
fighting your machines, fighting each other.

01:17:51.507 --> 01:17:57.117
But hear now, hear all you
people. You've come to listen.

01:17:57.147 --> 01:18:05.154
So sit down by the fire, inform yourself and
you'll hear the story of how this world began.

01:18:19.853 --> 01:18:24.145
In the time of dreaming, the land lay cold and flat

01:18:24.202 --> 01:18:29.665
nothing moved on the barren
surface. The world was empty.

01:18:30.153 --> 01:18:36.436
Then She, that powerful One, that most
beautiful One, the Rainbow Serpent

01:18:36.453 --> 01:18:38.953
was asleep under the ground

01:18:38.953 --> 01:18:43.356
with all life in Her belly, waiting to be born.

01:18:43.378 --> 01:18:49.965
Then the Great Spirit Father gently woke
Her and asked Her to stir the Universe into life.

01:18:49.965 --> 01:18:55.525
It was time for Her to rise up out of this Earth.

01:18:55.525 --> 01:19:00.615
She opened Her eyes and darkness
disappeared as She gazed over the land.

01:19:00.603 --> 01:19:03.103
She took a breath and the atmosphere changed.

01:19:03.116 --> 01:19:08.226
The air gently vibrated as the first breeze began to blow.

01:19:09.986 --> 01:19:18.014
She came out of the Earth at the heart of my people, at a place we named Uluru,

01:19:18.030 --> 01:19:21.300
which means "Sacred and "Permanent."

01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:26.040
This was the first place She
created; a place of innocence.

01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:30.160
She created it to stand alone, sacred, changeless.

01:19:31.167 --> 01:19:37.277
It is eternal and contains an irresistible awe which stirs a sense of mystery.

01:19:37.277 --> 01:19:41.697
It is at Uluru that Her people hear
Her voiceless, breath of wonder and

01:19:41.697 --> 01:19:45.873
with humility see Her manifesting, sublime form.

01:19:45.894 --> 01:19:48.394
It is a place of worship.

01:19:52.783 --> 01:19:56.815
She looked around. Everywhere, all was dark.

01:19:56.843 --> 01:20:00.625
There was no light, no colour.

01:20:00.635 --> 01:20:03.135
Then She began Her work.

01:20:03.135 --> 01:20:06.525
She pushed up the land into mountains and hills.

01:20:06.525 --> 01:20:12.325
She asked Her Son, the Good Spirit, to rise
high in the sky and bring light to the world.

01:20:12.347 --> 01:20:17.006
Now Her Good Son rose high in the
sky and He smiled down upon the land.

01:20:17.018 --> 01:20:28.126
The sky lit up from His smile and we Her children saw colour and shadow and that Good Spirit saw Himself in the shining waters.

01:20:31.835 --> 01:20:39.502
She went on a long journey from East
to West and from North to South.

01:20:39.502 --> 01:20:46.483
She crossed the barren land and wherever Her Feet touched the Earth, grasses, trees and flowers grew,

01:20:46.483 --> 01:20:49.102
covering the land in a blanket of colour;

01:20:49.125 --> 01:20:53.765
filling the air with their sweet aromas.

01:21:04.636 --> 01:21:07.943
She then called the animals
to come from their sleep.

01:21:07.966 --> 01:21:11.003
She made them full with the joy of life.

01:21:11.016 --> 01:21:17.146
She told them to spread throughout the land, until the land and the rivers were teeming with life.

01:21:17.169 --> 01:21:20.736
She made night to give a time
of rest to all Her creatures.

01:21:20.736 --> 01:21:27.019
She made the cycles and rhythms
of life to give food and shelter.

01:21:27.029 --> 01:21:32.634
Then She made us, Her people: not as lords
of the universe for that is Her abode,

01:21:32.650 --> 01:21:41.000
but in kinship with all existence, taking our
proper place, just as the stars took theirs.

01:21:41.023 --> 01:21:44.230
Time is meaningless for us. It is but a continuity;

01:21:44.253 --> 01:21:50.863
a circle firmly established, constantly confirmed, happening for ever.

01:21:50.863 --> 01:21:56.283
Our faith is woven with the familiar
fabric of life, of the land.

01:21:56.294 --> 01:21:59.854
The land itself confirms the truth of all that we believe;

01:21:59.898 --> 01:22:05.000
endorses the laws that discipline
us and legislates for our survival.

01:22:05.605 --> 01:22:17.139
Our people never too many, laughter loving, skilled in crafts, natural story tellers, singers, dancers, living together in balance with our surroundings.

01:22:18.674 --> 01:22:21.174
Life in harmony and order!

01:22:22.451 --> 01:22:26.021
We worship the Great Mother, who gave us life.

01:22:26.041 --> 01:22:29.771
She created our souls in the likeness of God.

01:22:32.650 --> 01:22:35.150
Many of us still hold true to our ways.

01:22:35.150 --> 01:22:37.650
We do not forget Her.

01:22:37.650 --> 01:22:42.430
In our sacred places we ask Her
to come back to Her children.

01:22:42.444 --> 01:22:49.616
"Come," we ask. "Bring us Your birds of many colours. Come back to Your rivers rushing to the sea.

01:22:49.611 --> 01:22:56.261
Come back to your teaming fish of a thousand colours and shapes." She is the Mother of us all.

01:22:56.261 --> 01:23:01.891
She is the Spirit of the land;
all its beauty, all its colour.

01:23:01.901 --> 01:23:07.361
But there were those who see no colour, who lost their connection with the land,

01:23:07.389 --> 01:23:11.779
who wish only to destroy the Mother and themselves.

01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:15.709
Their eyes were open, but they did not see.

01:23:21.288 --> 01:23:27.138
Those of us who did see were foretold of the storm that would sweep over our people.

01:23:27.138 --> 01:23:30.965
We have lived and now are living through that storm.

01:23:30.995 --> 01:23:36.475
We passed through the violence of a summer's
dream into the chill of a wintry night.

01:23:36.505 --> 01:23:41.185
In the broken mirror of our
innocence, we almost faded into space.

01:23:43.252 --> 01:23:49.739
Within each of us there is a dying voice reaching out somewhere for an answer.

01:23:49.757 --> 01:23:57.824
Strange how it is that people who suffer together have stronger connections than people who are content. So it us with us.

01:23:59.854 --> 01:24:03.693
Then white people came.

01:24:03.697 --> 01:24:06.433
At first they asked to use the land.

01:24:06.448 --> 01:24:11.278
Permission was readily given. The
concept of ownership was unknown to us.

01:24:11.278 --> 01:24:16.848
Land belongs to itself. It's the substance of the people and animals who live on it.

01:24:16.858 --> 01:24:22.226
It is saturated with the Great Spirit who is the source of all life.

01:24:22.248 --> 01:24:27.998
The Earth Mother, the Great Spirit gave
the land equally to all, to use freely.

01:24:27.998 --> 01:24:34.478
Our land is so large there is room for
everyone, but the invaders wanted it all.

01:24:34.499 --> 01:24:36.999
Soon they seemed to be everywhere.

01:24:36.999 --> 01:24:40.739
Soon we found our land and
hunting grounds gone from us

01:24:40.763 --> 01:24:44.219
and we were chased away like animals.

01:24:51.655 --> 01:24:56.239
When the sacred law is broken, all creation bleeds.

01:24:56.281 --> 01:25:02.802
Our culture smashed and in
ruins treated with contempt.

01:25:02.842 --> 01:25:04.631
Their religion enforced on us;

01:25:04.662 --> 01:25:08.492
self righteous, inflexible, incapable of self questioning.

01:25:10.873 --> 01:25:16.142
Our land used only as a mine for money and power.

01:25:21.458 --> 01:25:29.970
We had no defence against their guns and their poisons and their diseases, their conquering and possessive mines.

01:25:29.999 --> 01:25:37.769
Our land, which had been the home of people living in harmony; people who left no mark, no signs of depredation had been

01:25:37.791 --> 01:25:42.259
parcelled out among the settlers and kept away from us.

01:25:46.442 --> 01:25:50.627
We were moved on into areas of the poorest land,

01:25:50.652 --> 01:25:53.152
into lands denuded of trees,

01:25:53.152 --> 01:25:57.182
cut down wantonly, ravaged by erosion.

01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:24.347
But now I don't have the information
to look back on those days.

01:26:24.347 --> 01:26:28.340
I've heard the angel footsteps,
like the motion of the sea,

01:26:28.356 --> 01:26:31.028
telling of a new day.

01:26:31.057 --> 01:26:35.678
I behold the winds of change
sweeping across this land.

01:26:35.708 --> 01:26:41.597
In this age I've seen things happening
among all the people around us.

01:26:41.624 --> 01:26:49.917
and now, onward in our journey, I come to understand that every hair is numbered like every grain of sand,

01:26:49.927 --> 01:26:58.607
like every sparrow falling, all is in Her hands, like the perfect unfinished plan.

01:27:02.083 --> 01:27:07.356
Now our fears tell us that the storm of the white people's coming has passed

01:27:10.050 --> 01:27:14.815
and now there will be peace between us and a good time.

01:27:17.256 --> 01:27:24.484
This She has told us in our dreams, to help us to remember who we are.

01:27:27.039 --> 01:27:31.119
The animals of this country, like the emu

01:27:31.119 --> 01:27:40.378
with the dust of the red Earth Mother upon its feet, reminds us to protect the land; to always put back

01:27:40.389 --> 01:27:42.904
as much as we take.

01:27:44.827 --> 01:27:48.387
Then She told us to care for the big red kangaroo.

01:27:48.397 --> 01:27:52.077
He's the very colour and spirit of the land.

01:27:52.086 --> 01:27:58.947
He reminds us to take time for
ourselves and for the land.

01:28:01.272 --> 01:28:07.642
Then there is goanna, last of all,
because his legs are so short.

01:28:07.649 --> 01:28:16.389
He brings the news that we, his children,
are forgetting to give time to each other.

01:28:18.339 --> 01:28:25.325
But the animals of the land of our Earth Mother, come to say more than this.

01:28:25.348 --> 01:28:37.588
They come to say that our Creator, She who is the Rainbow Serpent, She who is full of tears for what we are doing on this Earth is with us.

01:28:40.508 --> 01:28:47.338
It is good for all people to dream of places which are beautiful and sacred.

01:28:48.118 --> 01:28:53.302
But for you, it seems that with all your great machines you can travel almost anywhere.

01:28:53.302 --> 01:28:56.612
You can travel across the land at great speed.

01:28:56.628 --> 01:29:05.671
For some, all that is sacred is the big city with its bright lights and the music and dancing of the modern world.

01:29:06.361 --> 01:29:08.861
There is almost nothing mankind cannot do.

01:29:09.978 --> 01:29:14.467
He can move in the air and even to the moon.

01:29:14.482 --> 01:29:18.577
But for us, we ask, "Why should we go?"

01:29:19.881 --> 01:29:22.381
"Where would we ask the
machines to take us?"

01:29:22.381 --> 01:29:25.874
They have no spirit or feeling of their own.

01:29:27.225 --> 01:29:31.845
We can guide them to the places that have meaning for us.

01:29:31.845 --> 01:29:38.965
That is why we, the people of this land, like our ancestors before us

01:29:39.006 --> 01:29:44.485
will always come back to this land, to this place of our being

01:29:44.495 --> 01:29:48.765
and share the feeling of this land with all living things.

01:29:48.785 --> 01:29:56.508
I belong here in this land where the spirit of the Earth Mother is strong in the land and in me.

01:29:56.528 --> 01:30:02.918
And you, people of the Earth listen,
take time. The time is meant to enjoy.

01:30:02.942 --> 01:30:08.528
Let the spirit of this mighty land
touch you, as it touches my people.

01:30:08.514 --> 01:30:15.028
Take time by the waters. The water is good,
for it carries the strength of the Mother.

01:30:15.024 --> 01:30:23.290
It will lift you up and gives you rest,
so that you can journey in this world.

01:30:24.648 --> 01:30:29.240
Then you can feel the joy that is seldom felt and see the dream that white people seldom see.

01:30:33.234 --> 01:30:44.944
Perhaps soon in all your travels, you will see the Great Mother in all the places that She has made.

01:30:44.964 --> 01:30:47.444
Perhaps,

01:30:47.466 --> 01:30:50.552
Perhaps, when the white heart opens.

01:30:50.552 --> 01:30:55.750
Perhaps, when the black heart heals.

01:30:55.760 --> 01:31:12.354
Perhaps, when the spirits of all peoples and the spirit of this land can once more be together as one.

01:31:41.432 --> 01:31:46.171
That was taken from Aboriginal poems
and compiled by Chris Kyriacou.

01:31:48.087 --> 01:31:56.447
The next item we have from the Iranians

01:31:56.487 --> 01:32:05.247
and the first item is a Qawwali, praising
Shri Mataji as the Spirit of God.

01:32:34.562 --> 01:32:41.542
Beloved Shri Mataji, Brothers and Sisters,
welcome to probably the first Iranian qawwali.

01:32:41.571 --> 01:32:48.759
This qawwali is called "Mataji Ruh- E-Allah" which means Shri Mataji the Spirit of God.

01:32:48.793 --> 01:32:59.523
It's in Farzi language. It's written by an Iranian, put to music by a Romanian, who was in Baba Mama's school in Nagpur

01:32:59.523 --> 01:33:06.767
and we're very much helped by the
French qawwali group. Thank you.

01:43:08.097 --> 01:43:20.037
So this is a dance and it's a Persian Dance and it's called the Minotaur Dance and this is a traditional dance from Isfahan, which is in Iran.

01:43:24.766 --> 01:43:36.986
It's the old city, a beautiful city with mosques and beautiful ceramics. It's very, very artistic, with a big palace.

01:43:39.193 --> 01:43:41.693
The ancient capital!

01:43:43.219 --> 01:43:49.336
Ah Isfahan I have been. It's a very, beautiful place and has

01:43:49.335 --> 01:43:53.974
got a very old palace and I
went with my brother, Baba

01:43:53.974 --> 01:44:01.405
and I was telling him that beyond this, there
is a well and there is a door here, this side.

01:44:01.411 --> 01:44:05.015
So the guide asked, "How does she
know? Has she been here before?"

01:44:05.012 --> 01:44:08.945
I said, "I have been, must have been."

01:47:27.573 --> 01:47:30.923
So the next item is a song.

01:47:43.897 --> 01:47:53.404
This is a traditional Sufi song and it
is the poetry of the great Saint, Rumi.

01:47:59.590 --> 01:48:03.680
The words, the translation of the
words are: A deer came in my midst

01:48:03.685 --> 01:48:07.915
and I tried to capture her,
but she vanished out of my sight

01:48:07.948 --> 01:48:12.346
and there in her place, I found You standing there,

01:48:12.376 --> 01:48:15.596
emanating all the joys I ever sought.

01:48:15.609 --> 01:48:19.776
You are the Mother, you are
the Mother of all the worlds.

01:48:25.998 --> 01:48:28.498
It's the next song.

01:57:03.924 --> 01:57:11.331
So we have a dance now. This is called 'Zarbi' which is another traditional dance.

01:57:11.331 --> 01:57:15.400
This time it is from Tehran.

01:57:15.420 --> 01:57:24.090
The music of this song is played with only one drum and it is an instrument, called the Zarb.

01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:28.955
It's a traditional Persian drum.

02:00:46.833 --> 02:00:53.833
The next item is a ... I'll get it
right in a second, Azerbaijani folk song

02:00:53.833 --> 02:00:56.333
Azerbaijan!

02:00:59.682 --> 02:01:06.187
And this is the folk music describing the incarnation of Shri Mataji as Fatima.

02:01:06.187 --> 02:01:09.517
And the translation reads: A deer came in my midst

02:01:09.502 --> 02:01:14.385
and I tried to capture her,
but she vanished out of my sight

02:01:14.382 --> 02:01:17.825
and then in her place, I found You standing there,

02:01:17.822 --> 02:01:20.615
emanating all the joys I ever sought.

02:01:20.638 --> 02:01:24.990
You are the Mother, You are the Mother of all the worlds.

02:01:25.014 --> 02:01:27.840
You are the Mehdi, You are the Mehdi

02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:34.250
the owner of the worlds. You are Fatima. You are my Mother, You are my Mother.

02:01:34.260 --> 02:01:39.730
You are Nirmala, You are my Mother, You are my Mother.

02:01:39.751 --> 02:01:43.703
For all the wise and all the lonely, who call for You,

02:01:43.703 --> 02:01:49.856
You are their Mother. For all the poor
and all the lost, You are their hope.

02:01:49.883 --> 02:01:53.646
You are aware of that which is hidden in their hearts

02:01:53.650 --> 02:01:59.426
and thus unfold the veil to reveal the Truth.

02:01:59.454 --> 02:02:02.761
The chorus is: You are the answer to all their questions.

02:02:02.787 --> 02:02:05.751
You are the answer of all their questions.

02:02:05.773 --> 02:02:08.273
You are Fatima. You are my Mother.

02:02:08.273 --> 02:02:12.413
You are Nirmala. You are my Mother.

02:02:12.433 --> 02:02:21.718
If one stands under your protection, whether poor, rich, lonely or lost, the fruits of Paradise will rain upon you.

02:02:21.728 --> 02:02:25.223
Mother You are the Giver of all these fruits.

02:02:25.226 --> 02:02:31.523
If all the oceans turned to ink
and all the trees turned to pens

02:02:31.546 --> 02:02:36.876
and all the poets wrote their
prose for one hundred years,

02:02:36.885 --> 02:02:43.910
some of you precious gift to us would be eternal and everlasting.

02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:48.689
Thank You for being Our Mother. Jai Shri Mataji!

02:02:57.851 --> 02:03:04.219
Shri Mataji, I have wrote the lyrics to this poem

02:03:04.231 --> 02:03:12.014
and I haven't spoken this language since 21 years.

02:03:12.024 --> 02:03:21.054
And I write it and I try to think
of all the things I have done.

02:03:21.064 --> 02:03:28.114
One thing has to do audience,
they have to dance with us.

02:20:26.794 --> 02:20:31.832
It is Bhajan everyone is there is invited to dance.

02:20:34.632 --> 02:20:37.132
Hindi 25

02:30:40.364 --> 02:30:44.194
With all this jubilation,

02:30:44.191 --> 02:30:46.691
such joy in the atmosphere,

02:30:51.510 --> 02:30:56.466
from so many nations

02:30:56.489 --> 02:31:06.104
you see people dancing with joy, in the name of God.

02:31:06.105 --> 02:31:13.025
Shows the future all over, in the whole world,

02:31:13.028 --> 02:31:16.641
Sahaja Yoga is going to spread.

02:31:30.284 --> 02:31:39.941
As we are all together, here, in pure love, in pure joy

02:31:39.951 --> 02:31:45.545
is such a dream of mine coming true.

02:31:45.542 --> 02:31:52.467
And I am so overjoyed to see all these
nations who have joined together

02:31:55.152 --> 02:32:02.102
Today, I don't know how to say,

02:32:02.133 --> 02:32:16.144
their efforts have really created
blossoms and blossoms of beauty and joy.

02:32:18.142 --> 02:32:20.642
I bless you all with my heart

02:32:23.743 --> 02:32:32.980
Keep on! Keep on moving, having faith
in your Self, in your Self Realisation.

02:32:32.980 --> 02:32:35.300
That's how we are going to progress.

02:32:35.360 --> 02:32:41.500
Tomorrow is a great day. We are going
to celebrate Shri Ganesha's birth

02:32:41.509 --> 02:32:45.740
and I was thinking we'd better have it earlier because it's....

02:32:45.755 --> 02:32:49.592
I don't know why the evening has become so cold.

02:32:49.584 --> 02:32:56.084
I think it must be Shri Ganesha's cool
is flowing all over. I can't explain.

02:32:56.104 --> 02:33:00.240
But we could have it earlier, so that
you don't suffer from this cold

02:33:00.240 --> 02:33:08.756
during Puja time. It can be even worse, me sitting there emitting all the vibrations, I don't know what would happen.

02:33:08.772 --> 02:33:14.096
So I would request all of you
tomorrow enjoy the morning nicely

02:33:14.138 --> 02:33:21.733
and about 4 o'clock, about 1
o'clock we'll start the Puja.

02:33:21.753 --> 02:33:28.650
It's not a very long Puja, because only Shri Ganesha's Puja it is, so not going to run long.

02:33:30.710 --> 02:33:37.340
I think there's.. I don't know whom to thank because people have done so well; all of you.

02:33:37.350 --> 02:33:41.530
All of you, I never expected all that,

02:33:41.527 --> 02:33:44.463
so beautifully everything arranged, organised.

02:33:44.469 --> 02:33:50.503
We never felt, at least I never felt it was night

02:33:50.493 --> 02:33:53.094
and I'm sure you all enjoyed it.

02:33:53.104 --> 02:33:56.314
May God bless you. God bless
you. Thank you very much.

02:33:56.366 --> 02:33:58.866
All the best for Iran also, I am saying.
