00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:29.700
It’s such a great thing to meet your children
after such a long time.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:38.950
And
this country was really pestered with cold

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:43.790
so I had to come here I think, just to make
you feel warmer with love.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:58.110
It’s a very heartening thing to see so many
people who are in England, who are Sahaj Yogis.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:12.750
As you know England has to do tremendous effort
to keep Sahaja Yoga afloat; not only that,

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:18.940
but you have to set in examples for others.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:26.220
As England is the heart of the universe it
circulates.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:29.740
Whatever example you set in, circulates.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.190
People try to follow you.

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:38.390
As I have told you before also, that English
people should not try to follow other people

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:42.500
but establish their own proper character.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:50.540
But not to be insular by which you don’t
appreciate anybody else or you cannot understand

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:53.520
international relationships.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:13:08.910
We are one world and it’s only one great
Viraat in Whose being we circulate.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:18.240
Moreover for the people who are from the heart,
[they] have to be much more open and moving

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:25.240
and giving because that’s the job of the
cell of blood that passes through [the] heart;

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:47.090
and that’s how you are made specially for
this.

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:55.020
I have been speaking after you finished your
tour on a subject in India.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:14:01.540
But I think it is more related to us here
in the West than to Indians.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:10.690
And that is something we have to understand:
that we are in the midst of terrible conditions,

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:19.050
horrible conditions which are taking us to
hell.

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:37.120
And we realise how important it is for us
to get together and save this area which we

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.580
called as ‘the Western world’.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:48.500
So I have already given a little talk which
you may hear when you have this seminar or

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.460
this Shiv puja.

00:14:51.460 --> 00:15:02.600
But I would like to tell you about it: that
Shri Krishna, a long time back, told that

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:10.210
the roots of the awareness are in the brain,
but the human awareness grows downward.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:16.860
That’s how we have grown downward.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:30.910
We have grown towards things which, if allowed
to grow that way, may take us away completely

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:32.130
from the roots.

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:42.430
Now if you start the movement, as I said,
from Bhavasagara, from the evolutionary process,

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:45.460
of going downward.

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:55.780
Now in the Bhavasagara that is in the viscera
of the stomach and all these places, we have

00:15:55.780 --> 00:16:00.060
a capacity, what we call as of consumption.

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:05.750
We can even consume the poison.

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:13.390
The liver can consume the poison; it has the
capacity to consume the poison as heat and

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:22.190
then it delivers the heat to the water of
the bloodstream.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:31.520
So the capacity we have to consume all those
things makes us, what we call ‘swahaa’:

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:35.810
‘swahaa’ means ‘consumption’.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:42.350
And from this consumption, when we consume
all these things: we consume our ego, we consume

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:47.980
our conditioning, we consume all those things
which are detrimental to our growth [then]

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.990
we become ‘swadhaa’.

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:54.630
‘Swa‘ is the Spirit and ‘dha’ is the
dharma.

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:59.960
We get the dharma of the Spirit.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:06.270
And you know what is the dharma of the Spirit
is – is Sahaj, Sahaja.

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:13.950
But when we start going downward only with
our awareness, from the Nabhi Chakra we start

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:21.490
moving downward, what happens to us [is] that
we move to the second position of Swadhishthana

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:27.750
and the Swadhishthana has got the essence,
I mean, has got the capacity to be ‘bhurvah’.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:34.340
‘Bhurvah’ means the whole Creation, the
universe that is created.

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:38.450
That’s how we get creativity through Swadhishthana.

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:46.840
So when we start moving downward, what happens
to us [is] we go to all the stars and the

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.940
planets and all that are created, that’s
what we are doing, wasting our energy for

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:52.420
nothing at all.

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:57.230
But apart from that in the wrong way when
we move, our attention goes to creativity

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:08.890
which is destructive, which is negative, which
brings death, which suggests insipidness.

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:13.160
Like the art today is, when you see the art,
you don’t know whether to vomit, to run

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.450
away or to cry.

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:21.450
So that explains why people are producing
such horrid things and when you look at them

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:25.180
you don’t understand what is this going
on.

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:36.610
So the art, the creativity, in every way,
the creativity of every kind becomes so horrid.

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:40.170
So the third stage is that we go to ‘bhuh‘.

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:44.280
‘Bhuh’ is this Mother Earth.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:48.800
Mother Earth is the one which also creates
Shri Ganesh.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:53.880
Now when we go towards Mother Earth we start
extracting Mother Earth, taking out all that

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:58.680
is precious, that is needed out of proportion
– because we have got machines.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.990
Now we have got machines so we must produce.

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:07.300
The machine must produce more and more and
more, out of proportion it should go on.

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:13.850
And when it wants to continue it has to go
on that way so that you feed the machine to

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:18.990
produce more.

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:24.600
Now this production is useless!

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.960
There is no need to have so much production
for us.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:33.290
You see plastics after plastics, then there’s
nylons after nylons, then there’s all kinds

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:37.710
of polyester and I don’t know all kinds
of things that they have started producing.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.200
All man-made nonsense that they have.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.020
There’s no need to have so much.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:48.270
Then we go on accumulating things and that’s
how we become extremely materialistic people.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:53.800
Actually to be materialistic in the real sense
is that we understand the value of matter.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.260
And the value of the matter is aesthetics.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.280
Artistic things, real artistic things.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:06.390
And beyond that the value of matter is that
you can give love to others through that matter:

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:10.250
by giving as presents, by your generosity.

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:11.780
So you lose that also!

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.320
That power also you lose.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:21.040
That is, you start extracting your Mother
Earth in such a way that you don’t know

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:26.500
what to do with the acid gas that is coming
out of these productions and then all your

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.210
trees are getting destroyed.

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:29.490
It’s so destructive.

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:32.660
The whole thing is so destructive.

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:41.570
So then you move to the essence of Mooladhara
which is innocence.

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:45.630
And when it is innocence, you start attacking
innocence.

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:47.710
Now you read horrible things, when you come
here.

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:53.070
I got the jitters when I heard about the six
year old girl and a three year old girl: I

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:54.070
just can’t bear it.

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:58.700
Supposing that was my child what would have
happened to me?

00:20:58.700 --> 00:20:59.700
And it’s my child.

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:00.860
That’s how I feel.

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:06.580
Then we are attacking the innocence everywhere
in every place and we have no sense of Mooladhar.

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:09.490
That’s how we go down.

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:13.890
And one step forward where do we go?

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:16.270
Into hell.

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:17.270
That is our movement.

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:19.290
We are going towards hell!

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:23.470
Straight forward, our movement is towards
hell!

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:28.330
Because I have explained in that little talk,
you can hear it again, that, when you see

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:34.010
the steps, you see the downward steps, then
you just see the platforms which are very

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:39.650
good, maybe of marble, very attractive, very
sensational, whatever you may call it.

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:43.170
And you feel like going down, it’s easy
to go down with the gravity because you have

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:52.020
come out from amoeba state or even earlier
from carbon stage, so you feel it’s easy

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.330
to go down.

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:59.720
It’s much easier to go down, so you go on
stepping on these steps and go down.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.510
You don’t see the heights.

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:07.820
But when you are going higher, rising higher
then you start seeing the heights.

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:11.920
And when you see the heights what do you see
from down below?

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.250
Absolutely this is our task.

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:16.640
From the hell we have to pull out people up.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.640
That’s hell!

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:21.420
And this is what we call as the ‘adhogati’
– going downward.

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:23.140
‘Adhogati’ – going downward.

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:27.440
We have to take to ‘Urdhvagati’ ( ऊर्ध्वगति)-
going higher.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.890
How do we go higher?

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:31.760
Only Kundalini is the way.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.630
That you can see clearly.

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:38.730
Even people who try to go higher without the
Kundalini, say from Nabhi upwards, how do

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:39.730
they do it?

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:46.370
They go up to mana, this is the emotional
side, that’s the motherhood.

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:48.650
And you go against the mother.

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:53.880
When you go there what you find [is] that
you get attached to this woman, that woman,

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:54.920
then that thing.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:23:00.320
It goes on to this family, to other things
and again you come down.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:06.420
Then you go ahead, you go into ‘janah’
– is the one which is what we call ‘the

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:07.730
public’, ‘the others’.

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:10.380
‘Janah’ is ‘the public’, is the Viraata’s
place.

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.290
As you know this is the Viraata’s place.

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:19.090
And when you go to that place, to Viraata’s
place, what happens to you [is] that you start

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:22.010
becoming very conscious of yourself, “Oh,
I am a public man.

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:23.270
I am a public person.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:24.480
This is my reputation.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.630
I am this and I am that."

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:30.650
And then you start exploiting people with
your politics and all other things like that.

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:39.340
And you develop your egos; all kinds of nonsensical
things.

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:46.010
With your mana, from your centre heart, you
develop also your conditionings and that’s

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:52.400
how you develop a funny personality which
is not urdhvagati, which is not going higher,

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:59.690
but is actually giving you additional problems
on your back!

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:06.060
Then the third thing is here at the Agnya,
as I told you, you develop your ego.

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:11.440
The other day Patrick rang me up to say, “Mother,
why are we developing our Agnyas so much nowadays?”

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.400
I said, “Stop reading newspapers!”

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:19.810
The prime ministers are fighting for their
seats and this and that and if you read newspapers

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:23.420
you will also feel that you are a prime minister
[and] you better fight it.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:29.950
Because when you see a picture or any drama
sometimes you get identified and you think,

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:33.880
“I am Napoleon myself!”

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:37.820
So don’t read newspapers!

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:43.610
Don’t read about these mad people who are
just trying to overpower each other.

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:45.900
Like this [Ferdinand] Marcos fellow.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.360
The other day somebody said that, “Mother,
you get rid of this Marcos!”

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.760
Now he’s out!

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.890
So many will be out but what about us?

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:54.510
Do we have some of them within our heads?

00:24:54.510 --> 00:25:01.940
Do we also have the same ideas of materialism
or ego or all these trips that these people

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:03.790
have had?

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:09.600
So as a result, when you see these things,
on the contrary, you should try to avoid it

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.550
and jump on to urdhvagati.

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:18.010
Then you go higher, from there, in the head
is the Sat, is the Truth.

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:22.560
That’s what you discover, Truth; should
discover in the normal way.

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:29.690
But in the abnormal conditions when you try
just to climb up to the brain, what happens

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:36.080
is that whatever you know through your mental
conception becomes the truth.

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.080
Everyone is like that.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:40.960
You see, about religion you will find a person
believes that, “This is the truth.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.450
Now this is the truth!”

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:49.510
“I am the one who represents Christianity”,
“I am the one who represents Mohammad Sahib”,

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:55.590
“I am the one who represents Nanak Sahib”,
“I am the one who represents Shri Rama,

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:57.090
Shri Krishna."

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:58.280
None of them represent.

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:00.250
It’s just a concept.

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:04.580
And with that concept if you move about like
that then what happens [is] you just get stuck

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:06.190
on to that idea.

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:09.290
That is how fanaticism comes in as far as
religion is concerned.

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:15.810
There are many, many things like that, “This
is a concept and that’s the fact, and that’s

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:19.080
the truth and that’s what I believe in this!”

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.290
But why do you believe in that?

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:23.460
Who are you?

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:26.850
When they say, “I believe,” just go and
ask them, “Who are you after all to believe

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:27.850
in that?”

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:28.850
That’s Mr.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:30.350
Ego, that’s all.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:33.270
Then there are people who are conditioned.

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:37.290
And that’s what, whatever is their conditioning,
they think, “This is the conditioning.

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:38.730
This is the thing I am brought up.

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:43.570
This is how I have lived and this is how I
am, and this is what is the truth."

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:48.300
Both things are absurd, mythical.

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:52.080
That’s not the Truth.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:58.750
So when you start through your urdhvagati,
through your Kundalini you see the height.

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:00.790
You see that, “Now we have to rise!

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:01.790
We have to rise.

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:02.790
Rise with our innocence.

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:04.150
We have to get to our innocence."

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:07.930
We have to be innocent people.

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:12.510
But even in Sahaja Yoga you will find some
people, I call them sometimes like monkeys,

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:14.730
jump from urdhvagati to adhogati, adhogati
to urdhvagati.

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:21.130
You don’t know which side they are going!

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:23.840
You have to hold on to these steps which you
have got.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.380
First is the innocence.

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:31.350
Your morality, as you call that, or a chastity.

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:34.860
That’s the first step you have to achieve.

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:41.560
Unless and until you achieve that step how
are you going to go further?

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:42.640
But it’s the other way round.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:47.140
They think if you tell something very truthfully
to Mother, “I have had five love affairs,

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:53.170
I have had six abortions, ten this thing,
then Mother is going to be very happy with

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:56.060
me,” because they have told the truth.

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:58.800
That’s not the truth.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.480
That’s not what is wanted.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.180
Are you now a chaste person?

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:09.790
Have you got the ideas of chastity and dharma?

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:13.350
That is the second step you can move into.

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:19.110
Aesthetically, are you rich aesthetically,
are you generous?

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:22.590
Can you appreciate the art of every country?

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:26.060
Or you just say, “Oh it’s not good because
it’s not English!”?

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.520
Or “It’s not good because it’s not French!”?

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.340
Or maybe, “It’s not from Wimbledon!”

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:34.240
Could come to that point!

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.730
I mean, what is happening to us?

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:45.190
We are becoming so insular, so small, so narrow
in our outlook, that’s impossible.

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:48.370
We cannot appreciate another person at all.

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:53.100
You ask anyone, everybody has an opinion about
others, what about yourself?

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.440
What is your opinion about yourself?

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.850
Can you laugh at yourself?

00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:03.140
And when I am giving lecture we also sometimes
think that Mother is talking about somebody

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:04.350
xyz, not about me.

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.170
That’s not so.

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:11.000
We have to project to ourselves and find out:
are we in chastity?

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.530
Are we in dharma?

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:13.530
Have we achieved that?

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:16.410
Have we achieved our innocence?

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:25.090
Have our eyes achieved that innocence, that
simplicity, that power?

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:34.110
So then we move up higher on the bhurvah state
where we have to know: are we aesthetically

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:35.680
equipped?

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:41.800
Do we have proper aesthetics?

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:48.670
In our behaviour, in our dress, in our lifestyle,
in everything?

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:52.290
Or are we still going on with the same things?

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:56.320
Like some hippies when they come to Sahaja
Yoga, it’s impossible to make them understand

00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:02.150
that – no more hippies now!

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:07.040
Then some come from another group, another
funny style, then they have the same style

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.250
of behaviour.

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:09.250
No!

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:14.900
‘Sahaja’: we have to be in the Sahaja
style, which is a common style for all the

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:19.780
Sahaja Yogis all over the world to dress up
decently, to talk decently, to have sweet

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:25.320
words, no harsh words, no anger, no temper,
nothing of the kind.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:32.050
But very, very gentle and a dignified personality.

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:38.800
Now here some of the so-called dignified also
can be very bhootish, I have seen that.

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:43.000
They can be very dignified and they can be
very inauspicious.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:49.390
So another quality of innocence, which is
auspiciousness; or we can say the combination

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:52.050
of innocence and bhurvah state is auspiciousness.

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:53.890
Does your house give auspiciousness?

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:55.750
Does your countenance give auspiciousness?

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:57.850
Is your talk auspicious?

00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:06.020
Is it a mantra when you talk?

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:11.360
Have you purified yourself so much that everything
that you do, every movement that you have,

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.950
is auspicious?

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:18.320
Is it blissful to be in your house?

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:20.320
To be in your company?

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:21.320
To be with you?

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:22.320
Is it blissful?

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:27.680
Let us direct ourselves to ourselves and see
that: are we blissful?

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:35.150
Are we emitting vibrations that are good?

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:39.690
It’s a very tremendous task because you
have to do it!

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:40.690
You have to do it!

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:42.690
Nobody else is going to do it!

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:47.130
If you want to save this world, you must know
it’s a tremendous task and one has to go

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:54.850
into a tapah for that, to know that you have
to be pure people.

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:55.990
Otherwise there could be hypocrites.

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:59.850
There are many who are Sahaja Yogis and not
at all Sahaja Yogis.

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:02.810
Sahaja Yoga is not for hypocrites at all.

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:04.630
You cannot be a hypocrite.

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:09.760
You have to be what you preach, what you say,
what you understand and what we stand for.

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:15.200
It’s not like this, “Oh I am a Christian,
all right, I am a Christian, but it’s all

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:20.720
right, I can have adulterous eyes, all right
because after all, you see it’s all allowed."

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:21.920
“Then what else?”

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:23.940
“Oh, I can drink, smoke."

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:24.940
“What else?”

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:28.690
“Oh, I can also kill some people, it doesn’t
matter you see.

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:33.090
It’s all right I’m Christian after all."

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:36.220
How are you a Christian?

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:45.880
Then, “I am a Hindu, you see I am a perfect
Hindu, but doesn’t matter if I try to discriminate

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.620
between Sikhs and Hindus, doesn’t matter."

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:49.620
How, why?

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:52.180
There’s no discrimination allowed in Hinduism.

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:54.200
No discrimination of any kind.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:59.480
Everybody has the same Atma.

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.620
How can you discriminate?

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:04.220
How can you have dowry system in a Hindu society?

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:08.920
How can you have any caste system in a Hindu
society?

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:12.590
You cannot have, just cannot have.

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:14.510
It’s not the religion.

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:19.920
So they speak one thing, do another thing,
it’s all hypocrites and all fanatics.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.340
And that’s how they become fanatics!

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:28.880
Like you ask Bishop of Canterbury, he says
that, “Holy Ghost, I don’t know, I am

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.000
agnostic about it!

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.670
I am doing my job!”

00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:33.760
That’s all!

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:39.290
This kind of frivolous attitude or we can
say a very hypocritical attitude is not for

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:40.290
the Sahaja Yogis.

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:43.510
They have to be what they are preaching, what
they are standing for.

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:49.130
They cannot have that kind of a personality
that one can say, “Oh, I have seen this

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:52.720
hypocritical fellow, calls himself Sahaja
Yogi!”

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:53.900
We can’t!

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:59.560
There has to be somebody who is genuine, who
is real, who is truthful.

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:04.520
We cannot live with that kind of a compromise.

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:10.200
We have to be what we are because we have
got the light of the Spirit.

00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:19.590
So then you go ahead and you have to become
the higher personality of a guru through consumption.

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:22.090
Consume, how much I consume!

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:24.920
Go on consuming all the time.

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:29.890
This time I came, I am consuming your Left
Vishuddhis, I am consuming your viruses.

00:34:29.890 --> 00:34:35.870
I don’t know, in two days I must have consumed
oceans and oceans of troubles.

00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:39.510
No, we don’t consume at all!

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:44.090
Because if somebody says something to us we
must come back with a harsh word, somehow

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:50.430
or other to kill that person that is finished
forever – that’s smartness.

00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:54.600
We can consume all that.

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.270
That consumption is taught by Christ very
well.

00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:58.860
Can we consume?

00:34:58.860 --> 00:34:59.860
No!

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:06.300
We come out with big, big talks and big, big
things, you see, “We must do this, we must

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:07.300
do that!”

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:12.040
We are not here union leaders, are we?

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.920
We don’t want to appear in the newspapers
or anything.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:19.030
What we want [is] to consume, we are here
to consume things.

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:24.760
Newspapers are to advertise, expand it.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:27.070
We are here to consume all that is bad.

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:30.060
Do you follow your responsibility please?

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:34.620
Consume [all] that is wrong.

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:35.750
How do we consume?

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:37.250
Through meditation, through prayers.

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:39.900
Now this is happening in this country.

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:43.940
What are we doing about it?

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:51.380
So we have to consume it, not to get into
explosions, not to get into expressions, but

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:56.840
to consume it.

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:59.500
Then you become swadhaa.

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:10.370
‘Swadhaa’ is that you become the dharma
of the Spirit – ‘swa’, ‘dha’.

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:13.060
You sustain that dharma within yourself.

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:14.610
Then you become that.

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:17.250
It’s not any kind of hypocrisy about it.

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:20.360
I mean, if I say, “Don’t drink."

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:21.360
You shouldn’t drink wine.

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:23.700
I don’t drink at all I mean, no question!

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:27.620
I mean, you cannot make me drink even if you
want to.

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:30.420
If I say, “Don’t tell lies!” then you
don’t tell lies.

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:36.010
You don’t just do it because you have to
just say that way, or you say that, “Don’t

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:37.010
kill!”

00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:42.890
I cannot kill anyone.

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:45.070
I cannot be tempted.

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:49.860
In the same way you all have to feel, “I
cannot do it, I cannot be tempted.

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:51.310
How can I be tempted?”

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:53.100
Say, “I shouldn’t get into tempers.

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:55.490
I shouldn’t be angry for nothing at all."

00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:59.290
For the slightest thing, people just jump
into a temper.

00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:03.120
That means, “I should not be tempted to
do that."

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:08.200
That wisdom, that dignity, that balance, that
poise must come into a Sahaja Yogi.

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:12.980
Unless and until that comes into you who is
going to believe you that you have achieved

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:14.100
anything of this transformation?

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.440
You are still on adhogati, sometimes into
urdhvagati.

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.020
Then going into adhogati, again to urdhvagati.

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:24.480
You are jumping from one to another.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:36.160
So now you move on to another higher level,
is from there to [where], what you call, the

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:40.920
‘Mahalakshmi tattwa’ starts; where you
start jumping on to a much higher position

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.370
where it is mana.

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:45.190
‘Mana’ is emotions.

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:46.910
Your emotions become compassion.

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:52.280
Now see the difference between emotions and
compassion: is very different.

00:37:52.280 --> 00:38:01.470
When the tree hasn’t got flowers it takes,
when it gets the flower, it gives, it gives

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:02.470
the fragrance.

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:05.950
In the same way, when you become the compassion,
you give.

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:13.640
You don’t expect how others treat you, how
others behave towards you, but you think [that]

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.740
by giving you will win over the person.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:18.430
You give.

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:27.170
And that is what you have got: to give compassion
through your vibrations.

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:31.500
But to have that you have to be swadhaa.

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:34.840
Unless and until you have that you cannot
give vibrations either.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:41.230
So then all these smaller ideas, “It’s
my wife, my husband, my child, my house, my

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:43.340
this, my brother, my sister."

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:47.130
In the beginning everybody comes up with the
whole family list.

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:51.170
They may not have seen their father for ten
years but they’ll come, “My father is

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:52.660
sick, Mother cure him first.

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:54.540
I have not seen him for ten years."

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:55.540
Doesn’t matter!

00:38:55.540 --> 00:39:00.430
So every person becomes a liability on Mother
that all the relations, all the great grand

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:09.890
parents and all the great grand children must
be cured by Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:18.170
But there is no compassion!

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:59.180
And in compassion you do not see these relations.

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:16.600
So, when you become the compassion, before
this you are to be enlightened.

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:20.620
You are to be enlightened, you have no light,
you don’t know how to walk the path, you

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:25.220
don’t know how to go round, you don’t
know how to know others, you don’t know

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:26.220
where you are sitting.

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:32.750
If in a group, you put off the lights everybody
starts hitting each other or trampling over

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:35.060
each other because they don’t know.

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:37.520
But now the lights are on.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.500
So you know how you are related to each other.

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:42.040
You are under the light.

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.260
You can see each other.

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:44.770
You can feel each other.

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:46.350
You can understand each other.

00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:50.510
That’s how the compassion works.

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:54.150
Compassion works automatically – you don’t
have to do much about it.

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:55.950
But know that you have to be a compassion.

00:40:55.950 --> 00:41:05.660
But if you are still are a person wanting
others to love you then it won’t work out.

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:13.900
How much did you love them?

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:17.550
Is your love for another person doubted?

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:20.370
Do you doubt?

00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:23.010
Then you are not compassion.

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:27.120
In that love you may even scold the person,
you may even shout at the person.

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:33.430
But the love should be there for the benevolence.

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:37.110
So the compassion should be for the benevolence
of the person.

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:40.250
If you are not benevolent you have not been
compassionate.

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:44.990
Like spoiling somebody, spoiling your child,
spoiling your wife, spoiling your husband.

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:46.890
This is not compassion!

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:57.800
Compassion is a pure ray of beautiful light
of God’s love which gives benevolence to

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:01.990
another person, hita.

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:06.030
So that should happen to you when you talk
of compassion.

00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:10.740
You go further with the janah – public.

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:15.420
Those people who cannot carry on with Sahaja
Yogis are absolutely useless people.

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:21.400
These are the cream, these are the best people
in the whole world.

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.100
Of course some are like this, doesn’t matter.

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:28.990
But they are the topmost people, they are
the people wedded to such high ideals.

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:31.910
Where do you get anybody with idealism?

00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:37.370
You go to the UN, you go anywhere you find
people, they have no idealism of any kind.

00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:43.760
It’s only for the job, only for the money,
or this or that, [that] they are working there.

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:45.940
You are the people who have idealism.

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:49.020
You are the people who are striving for something
higher.

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:52.690
You are the people who are going to save the
whole world.

00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:57.270
And those who cannot carry on with Sahaja
Yogis and find faults with Sahaja Yogis are

00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:59.020
really no good for us.

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:04.140
They should get out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:05.810
What is your public?

00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:08.490
First and foremost is Sahaja Yogis.

00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:13.450
The rest of them are outsiders so far.

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:17.250
But your attitude should be that you have
to pull them out.

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:18.490
You have to emancipate.

00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:19.490
You have to be kind to them.

00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:21.260
You have to be compassionate.

00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:23.770
And you have to bring them to Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:26.120
You have to be extremely nice to them.

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:34.070
But more than that you have to be very, very,
extremely nice to Sahaja Yogis.

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:39.200
I can’t understand Sahaja Yogis being nice
to others and not to their own clan or you

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:51.260
can call whatever you may call it – to their
own brothers and sisters.

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:57.770
When I see Sahaja Yogis together loving each
other, being kind to each other and also giving

00:43:57.770 --> 00:44:01.360
some good news about each other I feel extremely
happy.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:07.840
That’s one of the most joyous times for
me.

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:49.670
When I find that you are giving.

00:44:49.670 --> 00:45:00.170
So then you come to the point where you are
in the public, you are in the public.

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:01.720
You have to circulate now.

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.810
You have to articulate in the public.

00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:05.630
You have to move in the public.

00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:11.400
You are not only for a secluded group of Sahaja
Yogis, you are not that.

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:16.550
But you have to articulate, you have to circulate.

00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:21.990
Now for that, what should we do?

00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:33.700
You have to understand that we have to form
other groups, other things by which we can

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:34.700
circulate.

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:36.220
Let’s see now in England we can form some
societies.

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:45.630
Let’s form some society which are not what
we call them as the Sahaja Yogas.

00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:47.680
Because you are different from them.

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:49.660
So now let us form some societies.

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:56.490
We form certain societies, say let us form
a society where we talk about the decadence

00:45:56.490 --> 00:46:04.990
of this country; how the decadence has come
in, why it is there, why are we spoiling our

00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:07.810
young children, why are we behaving like this.

00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:08.870
Let us see.

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:12.390
Let us start a society under this name.

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:19.510
Let us start a society which will fight all
social problems.

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:24.660
Like I said in India: let us start a society
which is against dowry system.

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:27.290
That’s how you will circulate with them.

00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:31.760
And later on when they come up to a point
they will see your character and then you

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:37.420
can talk to them about Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:39.700
Like these women have, what is that called?

00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:41.920
‘Women’s lib’ and all that.

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:45.170
I mean, it is nonsense, you know that very
well.

00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:50.090
But they have formed the society, so they
are there, they are circulating.

00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:54.350
We have to have sensible, wise people forming
a society.

00:46:54.350 --> 00:47:00.640
So from Sahaja Yoga group we have to move
to society: where you need not talk about

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:03.320
Sahaja Yoga, you need not tell them there
is emancipation.

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:10.170
But let us circulate through them and let
them know about dharma.

00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:11.740
Forming no religion as such.

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:14.050
It’s inner religion as we have.

00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:17.250
Just without any religion you can start it
off.

00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:18.900
So that’s how you meet the public.

00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:24.560
There are many such ways, which you can think,
by which you can meet the public.

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:29.280
And then you have to know you are the part
and parcel of your Mother.

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:39.960
There are three things asked from God: that
there is salokya, that, “Oh God, We should

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:42.620
be able to see you,” salokya.

00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:47.410
Samipya is, “Oh God, let us have your company."

00:47:47.410 --> 00:48:01.730
And third one is, “Oh God let us have a
rapport with you."

00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:03.760
Rapport with you.

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:06.920
These are the three things are asked from
God.

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:11.200
But the fourth thing that has happened to
you is tadatmya, means you have become part

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.870
and parcel of my body.

00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:18.930
As a result of that you have to keep your
body all right, you have to be pure people,

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:23.690
you have to be sensible, otherwise I get into
trouble.

00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:31.280
But it’s a very venturesome thing I have
done, doesn’t matter, I don’t mind.

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:34.840
But you people look after yourselves.

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:35.950
You be sensible people.

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:40.930
And when you have funny ideas in your head,
know that these funny ideas can trouble our

00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:43.150
Mother very much.

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:49.670
So out of love for me, you have to keep loving
yourself.

00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:55.310
And you can love yourself only if you have
pure intelligence to know what is frivolous,

00:48:55.310 --> 00:49:02.970
what is nonsensical, whatever is asahaj.

00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:05.770
So you move like one body, always support
each other.

00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:08.630
If one person is troubled the rest of them
should help.

00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:11.830
That’s how the collectivity is going to
work out.

00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:21.280
Not to criticise each other, to sit down and
just to show off.

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:30.460
So then you rise even higher to this state
of Jesus Christ, Mahavira and Buddha.

00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:33.100
Then what do you have to do?

00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:37.030
Is tapaha, is the penance.

00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:39.050
You have to do the penance.

00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:45.030
Like living in Brahmapuri was a penance, I
thought, but you all enjoyed it bit too much.

00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:47.390
Or Ganapatipule, you thought it was too much.

00:49:47.390 --> 00:50:01.640
Some people did do some penance by sitting
in the sun! (laughing) But penance means ‘sacrifice’.

00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:05.400
Sacrifice.

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:09.230
Without feeling the sacrifice, do the work
as a sacrifice.

00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:13.310
You are bound by work.

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:14.470
We have to work.

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:16.160
Human beings have to work.

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:21.560
But the work that is a sacrifice is the most
nourishing thing, is the most joy-giving thing.

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:28.500
And that’s what happened: in Brahmapuri
I must say it was very spartan, both for you

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:34.110
and for your hosts it was quite a funny place
to live in.

00:50:34.110 --> 00:50:40.910
And one snake crawled into somebody’s shoes
I am told, but still you all enjoyed it because

00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:42.180
you didn’t feel the sacrifice.

00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:49.430
It was in a way [a] sacrifice for both the
parties I think: your hosts and the guests.

00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:51.510
But you still enjoyed.

00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:53.170
And that’s what it is.

00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:57.190
Now you will enjoy your sacrifices.

00:50:57.190 --> 00:51:00.010
Apart from all other virtues you will enjoy
your sacrifices.

00:51:00.010 --> 00:51:05.860
That is one of the quality of the Spirit,
because you are so detached.

00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:13.140
You will enjoy it!

00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:15.590
So that’s how you come to the state of tapah.

00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:21.600
And the last is satya, is the truth.

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:26.350
That is what is in the brain as Shri Krishna
has described, are the roots where you have

00:51:26.350 --> 00:51:27.370
to go.

00:51:27.370 --> 00:51:30.670
Of course, the doors are open to you.

00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:32.590
You must know that you know the truth!

00:51:32.590 --> 00:51:35.840
You know the truth, nobody else.

00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:45.900
Are you aware of this, that you are the only
few people under this roof who know the truth?

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:48.120
The rest don’t know any truth whatsoever.

00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:52.390
So you have to be compassionate to them because
they are blind, they can’t see.

00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:56.720
As we are kind to the blind people we have
to be kind to the people who do not know the

00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:57.720
truth.

00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:58.720
You know the truth!

00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:04.030
And the truth is that you are the Spirit.

00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:10.100
And then you know, through all miracles, that
you are walking in the Kingdom of Heaven.

00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:13.660
That you are blessed by God and that you are
looked after by Him.

00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:19.630
So many miracles happen, so many of these,
that suggest that you are really looked after

00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:21.700
by God Almighty.

00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:24.080
So many beautiful things have happened to
you.

00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:28.230
Just think of them one by one from where to
where we have come.

00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:34.910
From down below hell rising up one by one,
step by step, now we have come to the brain.

00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:42.350
Thanks to our Kundalinis that we have come
up there, that the Mother has brought you

00:52:42.350 --> 00:52:43.350
there.

00:52:43.350 --> 00:52:47.570
This Kundalini which is your Mother has brought
you there.

00:52:47.570 --> 00:52:51.000
Respect Her and respect your Realisation.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:56.990
Respect each other and know that you are higher
than billions and billions of people of this

00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.990
earth.

00:52:57.990 --> 00:53:05.940
You are special people and as that you have
to behave in the most humble, respectable

00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:07.760
and a loving manner.

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:10.980
I say love is the highest.

00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:20.960
Everyone who has developed a language of love
is working out God’s wish because God’s

00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:30.660
wish, His desire, His iccha, that Shakti,
is the power of love.

00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:34.630
We work out everything with hatred: what’s
wrong with that person, what’s wrong with

00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:38.640
that house, what’s wrong with this association,
with that.

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:39.780
That is all hatred.

00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:45.460
But let’s see what’s good with that, what’s
nice, what’s joyful.

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:50.980
When your eyes turn that way, when your attitudes
turn like that, then you must know that you

00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:55.010
are Sahaj Yogis.

00:53:55.010 --> 00:54:05.260
For that Christ has given us a big weapon
called forgive, forgive, forgive.

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:06.510
And the truth has dawned upon you.

00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:07.930
You know the truth.

00:54:07.930 --> 00:54:11.370
Through your vibrations you know, through
your vibratory awareness you know.

00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:17.160
But, there is a very big ‘but’ for which
I have to tell you again and again and I am

00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:20.740
telling you again today which is the most
important thing for a Sahaj Yogi – is to

00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:23.010
use your vibratory awareness.

00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:24.820
They don’t!

00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:27.830
They just don’t use their vibratory awareness.

00:54:27.830 --> 00:54:30.750
In judging others they never use their vibratory
awareness.

00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:32.910
Then how do we say they are special people?

00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:35.680
Because you have the same eyes, you have nose.

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:38.750
What about your vibratory awareness?

00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:41.740
Did you see the vibrations when you did something?

00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:43.140
You did not!

00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:44.990
That’s why the mistakes.

00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:51.650
Because these vibrations come as an indication
from something that is your Spirit, which

00:54:51.650 --> 00:54:56.840
is an absolute thing, which is in absolute
state – it is not relative.

00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:57.840
It’s absolute.

00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:01.410
So whatever information it gives you is absolute.

00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:03.720
And you should take to that absolute understanding.

00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:08.030
This is where we miss.

00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:14.410
So today just before Shiva Puja, Shiva Puja
is the puja of the Spirit within you.

00:55:14.410 --> 00:55:19.750
It’s the Spirit within you.

00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:26.700
And for this puja specially you have to determine
that now we will use our vibratory awareness

00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:27.970
to judge something.

00:55:27.970 --> 00:55:30.310
“I think…” is not there.

00:55:30.310 --> 00:55:37.570
“I think…” is a wrong idea.

00:55:37.570 --> 00:55:40.820
I know through vibratory awareness.

00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:46.120
We have to develop a word for this, which
we say, “I feel…” it could be something

00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:48.490
nonsensical.

00:55:48.490 --> 00:55:59.440
But you really, as they say in Marathi there’s
a word, ‘zanee’: is a feeling.

00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:02.030
But it’s a new awareness.

00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:06.660
Through this awareness, this Divine awareness,
through that, you have to judge everything,

00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:09.550
to know everything, and to do everything through
that.

00:56:09.550 --> 00:56:15.100
This is what we have to use.

00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:23.160
And when we start doing that then you will
know that God is working out everything for

00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:24.160
us.

00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:26.410
It’s so simple.

00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:27.630
Life becomes much simpler.

00:56:27.630 --> 00:56:33.910
All your complications, all your angers, all
your troubles, all will vanish as soon as

00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:40.490
you start using this, because it is such an
universal thing and such a benevolent blessing.

00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:45.180
It just makes you wonderful.

00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:56.000
You become a wonderful personality: happy
joyous, straight-forward, open-hearted, fearless.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.500
Absolutely enchanting.

00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:03.810
May God bless you all.

00:57:03.810 --> 00:57:09.150
You want to have any questions?

00:57:09.150 --> 00:57:23.280
This lecture has been rather complicated I
think, in a way, so it’s better to repeat

00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:24.840
it or them, sometimes, again.

00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:31.180
Maybe at Shiv puja would be a good idea.

00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:32.730
Any question please?

00:57:32.730 --> 00:57:41.300
New Lady: How can you forgive a person like
Hitler?

00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:43.960
Shri Mataji: Actually, you see, you don’t
do anything.

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:46.480
When you forgive or not forgive, you really
don’t do anything.

00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:47.480
It’s a myth.

00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:48.480
It’s just a myth.

00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:49.480
“I don’t forgive."

00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:50.480
Means what do you do?

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:51.480
It’s a myth.

00:57:51.480 --> 00:58:05.850
New Lady: It’s how you feel towards a person
who has committed so many crimes and the detention

00:58:05.850 --> 00:58:07.230
of Jews.

00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:11.330
Shri Mataji: But what about Jewish now?

00:58:11.330 --> 00:58:15.080
If they had forgiven Hitler, God would have
looked after him!

00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:16.210
God is looking after him.

00:58:16.210 --> 00:58:20.450
But when the Jews didn’t forgive him, they
have become more like Hitler, sometimes.

00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:23.310
They behave like Hitler sometimes I feel.

00:58:23.310 --> 00:58:26.680
The way they are treating PLO people is something
horrible.

00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:32.670
You see, so if you do not forgive you become
like the person you are hating.

00:58:32.670 --> 00:58:34.710
If you forgive you don’t become like that.

00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:36.740
Just that person goes out of your mind completely.

00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:39.410
I mean, they have imbibed certain qualities
now.

00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:42.390
I can’t imagine Jews behaving like this!

00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:45.300
They are behaving in a very funny manner.

00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:46.820
You can see it clearly!

00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:54.710
I mean, they had no place to go, they had
no land to live, they were given a land.

00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:58.460
And now the way they are troubling PLOs, I
was amazed.

00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:02.610
Because I met some of the students of this
PLO people who came to India, who have been

00:59:02.610 --> 00:59:03.860
given asylum.

00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:09.380
And when I heard how Jews tortured them – just
like Hitler, just like Hitler.

00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:12.240
I wish they had forgiven.

00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:17.330
I mean, if they had not forgiven Hitler, what
did they do out of it?

00:59:17.330 --> 00:59:18.330
Nothing!

00:59:18.330 --> 00:59:19.910
Hitler is punished by God, not by you.

00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:22.430
What can you punish him?

00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:25.880
You cannot punish him.

00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:28.750
Alright?

00:59:28.750 --> 00:59:32.430
When we forgive, we don’t imbibe that cruelty
within ourselves.

00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:34.370
That’s the biggest thing that happens.

00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:40.600
Apart from that we do not suffer when we forgive.

00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:50.440
I mean, if you go on thinking about it, what
people did say, imagine, think of the people

00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:51.440
when Mr.

00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:55.210
Columbus reached America, who followed them
[and] what they did there!

00:59:55.210 --> 00:59:56.290
Horrible things.

00:59:56.290 --> 00:59:58.960
I mean, worse than Hitler.

00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:03.390
They wiped out each and every person from
there.

01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:08.400
Then when they tried to consume other countries,
going to other countries and ruling them.

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:12.130
If you go to China you will be shocked, even
about English, what they have to say.

01:00:12.130 --> 01:00:14.180
Even in India, if you go, you will find.

01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:19.360
How can anybody forgive them if you think
what they have done?

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:24.400
But that is finished now and gone, forever!

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:27.740
You are not to think about it at all.

01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:28.790
It’s finished.

01:00:28.790 --> 01:00:31.920
Today, what is the situation, we have to see.

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:38.580
You will be amazed, if I tell you, that myself,
I was tortured by English very much.

01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:39.580
So what?

01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:41.110
For me you are my children.

01:00:41.110 --> 01:00:43.660
I don’t think of that at all because that’s
finished.

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:45.970
They were bhootish people, that’s all – finished.

01:00:45.970 --> 01:00:46.970
Where are they?

01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:48.280
Where is Hitler today?

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.610
Where are those people who died?

01:00:50.610 --> 01:00:51.610
Finished!

01:00:51.610 --> 01:00:56.700
Better to forgive so that God punishes them
well.

01:00:56.700 --> 01:01:02.940
Now, today, is not the time of punishing anyone,
it’s the time of evolving, of helping people

01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:04.340
to rise above that.

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:08.490
So there is no more danger of getting any
Hitlers on this Earth.

01:01:08.490 --> 01:01:10.430
We have to create such a beautiful garden!

01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:13.260
Why to think of the thorns?

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:16.890
Forget about all that nonsense, you see!

01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:23.500
These are special blossom times: let us think
of the flowers and not of the past and the

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:26.570
thorns that we had finished off.

01:01:26.570 --> 01:01:30.610
We have to give something very beautiful to
our children.

01:01:30.610 --> 01:01:31.670
Isn’t it?

01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:34.720
A heritage where people will say, “Oh, I
see.

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:42.440
There were people who forgave all such things
and created a beautiful world for us!”

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:48.890
Isn’t it a nice thought?

01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:52.240
Better than not forgiving.

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:58.290
Like that we go on thinking about, “He did
this and he did that."

01:01:58.290 --> 01:01:59.810
There’s no end to it!

01:01:59.810 --> 01:02:01.070
God looks after!

01:02:01.070 --> 01:02:02.070
He’ll punish.

01:02:02.070 --> 01:02:03.740
He’s punished him so badly.

01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:05.750
Now nobody wants to take Hitler’s name!

01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:11.210
I mean, if somebody sees Hitler’s photograph
somewhere he will go and have a bath in India.

01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:15.170
He’ll just go to the river Ganges and have
a bath, “Oh God!

01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:21.210
How did I see Hitler’s face anywhere?”

01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:28.920
What more you want as a punishment for Hitler
that they can ’t even face his photograph?

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:33.710
And some person who looks like Hitler, they’ll
say, “You just shave off your moustache

01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:35.540
at least!

01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:39.180
Don’t look like that.

01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:41.910
It’s very inauspicious!”

01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:46.760
Yes, I know somebody who looked like Hitler
and they said, “You shave off your moustache

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:50.990
and comb your hair from the other side, or
make it a parting in the centre.

01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:57.740
We can’t see you like this early in the
morning!”

01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:58.740
Imagine!

01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:04.490
What an inauspicious face! (laughter) He’s
hated by anyone.

01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:06.350
You go to any place.

01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:07.940
Even in Germany they hate him.

01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:15.840
So what’s the use of such a character being
so much dominant on our heads?

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:17.940
Have nothing to do with it.

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:22.200
Because once you start thinking about him
you also develop certain habits that he had.

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:27.880
A little cruelty comes up when you become
angry and when you cannot forgive others,

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:30.660
you also think it’s right that you can punish
others.

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:34.170
Here we are not fighting the sword with a
sword but with a shield.

01:03:34.170 --> 01:03:38.390
We are fighting the sword with a shield.

01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:46.660
We never fight sword with a sword, we fight
it with a shield.

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:54.070
That’s a wise attitude towards life, I think.

01:03:54.070 --> 01:03:56.010
Otherwise you will create more Hitlers.

01:03:56.010 --> 01:03:59.160
One Hitler is dead and now ten Hitlers have
come out – already have come out!

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:09.490
They are all to be finished now, once [and]
for all.

01:04:09.490 --> 01:04:34.150
You can help by creating a new pattern, a
new world of beauty.

01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:35.160
Any other question please?

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:39.760
That’s a nice question, I know it happens
to her.

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:44.140
But now you are feeling better inside aren’t
you?

01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:45.950
(laughing) Much more!

01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:48.750
That’s how we have to bring peace on this
Earth.

01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:55.190
How are we going to bring peace if there’s
still lurking anger?

01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:58.470
Not forgiving means anger!

01:04:58.470 --> 01:05:03.450
That’s all.

01:05:03.450 --> 01:05:05.940
Hmmm.

01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:10.920
What else?

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:14.650
Ask some questions at least!

01:05:14.650 --> 01:05:16.760
Must ask some questions.

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:19.110
Yes, what’s that doctor?

01:05:19.110 --> 01:05:20.150
Dr.

01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:35.830
Brian Wells: Shri Mataji, sometimes in my
work I find myself getting very angry with

01:05:35.830 --> 01:05:43.210
the people I work with is this ever appropriate
or should one always try and love and forgive

01:05:43.210 --> 01:05:44.210
them and be gentle.

01:05:44.210 --> 01:05:45.210
Shri Mataji: Yes, better try that! (laughter)
As far as possible!

01:05:45.210 --> 01:05:46.210
But sometimes anger can also help.

01:05:46.210 --> 01:05:50.100
But I think, just now, for us, we are developing
now, it’s better to take to the more gentler

01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:53.460
ways and things like that and not to get angry
– for the time being.

01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:55.780
But we’ll have to show anger sometimes.

01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:58.560
Let God show the anger.

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:01.350
Let him take the credit.

01:06:01.350 --> 01:06:06.740
You will be more effective if you are gentle,
I tell you.

01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:15.350
By anger you cannot correct people, you cannot
make them more efficient; but by love.

01:06:15.350 --> 01:06:19.480
Those days are gone where anger and hot-temper
used to impress people.

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:23.920
Nowadays these people don’t like such people.

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:28.070
Anger or some people are also very silly.

01:06:28.070 --> 01:06:32.790
They think [that] by being silly they’ll
impress others: like clowns or something.

01:06:32.790 --> 01:06:33.830
It’s not so.

01:06:33.830 --> 01:06:40.690
Now we are different people in this world
and they just know that this is a silly person,

01:06:40.690 --> 01:06:42.360
that’s all.

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:48.720
They expect a leader or anybody who has to
give something to others has to be something

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:58.810
of a higher and a better personality – it’s
expected.

01:06:58.810 --> 01:07:09.640
Cheapish things or anything that is publicly
people may like you to do, it a leader does

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:14.590
that they don’t like it, they don’t like
it.

01:07:14.590 --> 01:07:21.000
A leader is supposed to be something above,
above the normal.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.570
But the idea of leadership these days is alright:
everybody is doing the ‘shake’ so the

01:07:25.570 --> 01:07:26.670
leader is doing the shake.

01:07:26.670 --> 01:07:32.750
Then everybody wears a tight jean [so] the
leader also wears the tight jean and he can’t

01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:34.450
sit on his chair!

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:36.290
So that’s not the way.

01:07:36.290 --> 01:07:39.600
That’s not the way you can be leaders.

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:43.440
A leader has to make a pattern of his own.

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:47.610
And he doesn’t have to solve the problems
of the people but give them the problem to

01:07:47.610 --> 01:07:48.610
be solved.

01:07:48.610 --> 01:07:50.180
That’s how leadership works out.

01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:55.710
So for anybody who wants to get anything done,
must learn that the pattern should be of such

01:07:55.710 --> 01:08:05.170
a level that others should not take advantage,
should not think that they can bring you to

01:08:05.170 --> 01:08:06.170
your level.

01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:11.260
For example, I’ll tell you: in India there’s
a habit of eating tobacco, dried tobacco.

01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:17.760
Now, those people who eat tobacco, say there’s
a high court judge – he’ll call his peon

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:26.760
and ask him “Have you go the…”, they
call it ‘dubbi’ means a small little pouch,

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:31.990
so, “Have you got the dubbi?”

01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:34.950
So, the whole dignity is finished!

01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:37.260
Whole dignity is finished!

01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:42.200
That, just an ordinary peon can say, “Do
you want your dubbi?”

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:44.620
So then it’s done.

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:50.500
What about his great position and dress and
everything?

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:58.040
He makes a big gown and wears [and] on the
head they wear a kind of a wig.

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:09.910
And all that is useless because you are asking
for a dubbi from a peon!

01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:18.760
So what impresses people is dignity, balance,
poise, humility and truthfulness – straightforward

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:23.690
truthfulness – even in day to day work.

01:09:23.690 --> 01:09:30.230
Of course efficiency comes like that.

01:09:30.230 --> 01:09:34.970
Peacemaking.

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:37.670
You must make peace between two persons, ten
persons.

01:09:37.670 --> 01:09:42.310
Try to make peace instead of supporting one
person or taking sides.

01:09:42.310 --> 01:09:44.230
Best is to make peace.

01:09:44.230 --> 01:09:55.000
But if somebody is doing absolutely wrong,
then you have to take another attitude.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.620
Any other question?

01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:58.030
Yes?

01:09:58.030 --> 01:10:00.850
Yogini: (unclear)

01:10:00.850 --> 01:10:07.890
Shri Mataji: What’s she saying?

01:10:07.890 --> 01:10:18.730
Yogi: She’s asking you to tell us how we
settle down in Sahaja Yoga.

01:10:18.730 --> 01:10:19.730
For the new people.

01:10:19.730 --> 01:10:20.730
Shri Mataji: Settle down in Sahaja Yoga?

01:10:20.730 --> 01:10:21.730
You are already settled!

01:10:21.730 --> 01:10:33.970
Gavin Brown: Some of the new people have come
quite new to Sahaja Yoga, they haven’t met

01:10:33.970 --> 01:10:34.970
you before Mother.

01:10:34.970 --> 01:10:42.360
Shri Mataji: You see, I was born so settled
down I don’t know! (laughter) First of all,

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:49.160
in Sahaja Yoga, one has to realise that you
have got vibrations.

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:51.400
Now, put it on that.

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:53.130
I think that’s the best criteria.

01:10:53.130 --> 01:10:57.190
“Am I getting my vibrations alright?

01:10:57.190 --> 01:10:58.460
Are they flowing alright?

01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:00.730
If not, what’s wrong with me?”

01:11:00.730 --> 01:11:03.480
Direct your attention to yourself to find
out.

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:06.780
“Is there anything wrong with me that I
cannot get my vibrations alright?

01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:07.780
Alright!

01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:09.440
There must be something wrong.

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:10.700
Now what is that wrong?”

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:12.120
Try to correct it.

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:15.970
First of all they must direct their attention
to themselves then they will start settling

01:11:15.970 --> 01:11:16.970
down.

01:11:16.970 --> 01:11:20.900
But all the time, supposing, I have seen many
people who come to Sahaja Yoga: out of them

01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:24.390
some say, “I saw one Sahaja Yogi who was
like this!”

01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:28.320
They see to others: how they are are, how
they are, how they are.

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:33.420
You should see to yourself because this is
for your benevolence, for your betterment.

01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:37.460
So the first attitude should be, “What have
I gained?

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:39.700
What have I to gain?

01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:43.090
How am I to get better?”

01:11:43.090 --> 01:11:48.910
Or else there could be some people who think
that, “I must get better.

01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:50.080
My health should be alright.

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:55.570
I didn’t get kshema, benevolence, as was
promised by Sahaja Yogis!”

01:11:55.570 --> 01:11:59.040
No, something wrong with you: still the yoga
is not established.

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.670
First establish your yoga.

01:12:00.670 --> 01:12:06.240
If you have not established your yoga how
can you get what you want?

01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:09.080
So, first of all it’s such a genuine effort.

01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:13.140
One has to be absolutely genuinely asking
for that yoga.

01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:15.250
And you cannot force people.

01:12:15.250 --> 01:12:17.340
You cannot force it.

01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:18.340
Whatever lecture you may give.

01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:22.940
You may like my lectures or anything, they
might sound very good but it doesn’t matter.

01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:25.470
It must go into your being.

01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:27.560
It must work out in your being.

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:29.010
You have to become something.

01:12:29.010 --> 01:12:31.260
You should certify yourself that, “Yes,
yes.

01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:33.980
I am like that."

01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:35.990
We may be very few – doesn’t matter.

01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.990
It’s meant for the few.

01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:43.510
It cannot be given to every funny type of
a person or a person who is just forced into

01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:44.510
Sahaja Yoga.

01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:45.510
You cannot force it.

01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:51.470
It’s not like winning over election, you
see, that you make somebody a communist and

01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:53.190
overnight he becomes a capitalist.

01:12:53.190 --> 01:12:55.620
It’s not like that.

01:12:55.620 --> 01:12:57.330
It’s the inner growth.

01:12:57.330 --> 01:13:04.580
And only those who are deserving, who have
that value of their own existence – only

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:06.280
such people can come.

01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:09.030
So you cannot force on them at all!

01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:10.490
They have to see to it.

01:13:10.490 --> 01:13:14.480
And what they have to see in other people
[is] that what are they doing that they are

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:15.890
so much settled.

01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:20.290
And there should be an understanding that
we have just now entered into the university,

01:13:20.290 --> 01:13:24.040
say for example: a new class we are in.

01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:26.760
Now how are we to go higher and higher?

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:29.090
Their attitude has to be that way.

01:13:29.090 --> 01:13:30.970
You cannot force things into them.

01:13:30.970 --> 01:13:35.390
It’s like I always say [that] I have cooked
for you, the food is ready.

01:13:35.390 --> 01:13:37.060
If you are hungry you will eat it.

01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:39.790
I cannot force the food into your mouth!

01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:41.530
You have to taste it yourself and enjoy.

01:13:41.530 --> 01:13:47.830
But there’s a gap, gap between when they
get Realisation and when they feel joy because

01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:52.330
specially in the West they have no idea as
to what Realisation is, they have never known

01:13:52.330 --> 01:13:53.330
the Kundalini.

01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:58.550
It’s a new language to them, everything
is new, so they have to be given little assistance

01:13:58.550 --> 01:14:02.380
and help to tell them that, “No, there is
joy!

01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:03.380
You have to go beyond.

01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:05.960
You have to see [that] these things exist.

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:07.540
Whatever the saints have said is true.

01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:11.470
Whatever the scriptures have described is
true and you can find out.

01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:13.680
But you have to have patience with yourself."

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:17.850
But if they want to criticise and they want
to say, “Oh, how can that be?

01:14:17.850 --> 01:14:18.850
And how can that be?”

01:14:18.850 --> 01:14:21.750
Such people will take too much time!

01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:24.150
But there must be some genuine seekers.

01:14:24.150 --> 01:14:29.820
And there are some slow movers also so accordingly
they move and you cannot force them.

01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:36.010
At the most you can support them for a while
but then again they drop down.

01:14:36.010 --> 01:14:37.010
You have seen that.

01:14:37.010 --> 01:14:41.930
It’s happening every time in the West specially,
not in India.

01:14:41.930 --> 01:14:42.930
Not in India.

01:14:42.930 --> 01:14:44.080
Not that, also, in [Indian] villages – it
doesn’t happen.

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:47.610
Once you get six thousand you get six thousand
– finished!

01:14:47.610 --> 01:14:48.990
I have known least of them.

01:14:48.990 --> 01:14:51.450
I don’t know who they are [but] they are
there.

01:14:51.450 --> 01:14:55.700
You meet them somewhere and they’ll just
come and fall at my feet and say, “Mother

01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:57.250
I am a Sahaja Yogi."

01:14:57.250 --> 01:15:00.460
I said, “I know that.

01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:01.460
I know you are.

01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:06.460
You are my children I know just from your
presence I know you are my children."

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:09.280
So they have to become that.

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:10.300
You cannot force.

01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:12.360
That’s one thing we do not realise.

01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:22.040
You see, now, in the churches they are compromising,
“Let’s have a disco dance!

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:30.180
And in the disco dance when the people will
come then we will have some Christians there."

01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:31.180
Imagine!

01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:36.560
People who are going to disco dance how can
they be Christians?

01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:41.790
And this kind of a compromise is there because
it’s a money-oriented stuff.

01:15:41.790 --> 01:15:43.690
It is not God-oriented, it’s money-oriented.

01:15:43.690 --> 01:15:47.730
So, “We must have more people so that we
have more money so we can have more clergies,

01:15:47.730 --> 01:15:48.840
we can give more pay."

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:51.250
It’s all on that level [that] it works.

01:15:51.250 --> 01:15:53.080
But not in Sahaja Yoga.

01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:59.100
In Sahaja Yoga everyone is a temple of God,
everyone is a church of God and everyone has

01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:00.490
to come up to that.

01:16:00.490 --> 01:16:05.330
And those who do not have that respect of
oneself, we cannot force.

01:16:05.330 --> 01:16:07.850
How can you say, “You must have respect
for yourself!”

01:16:07.850 --> 01:16:09.260
Can you say like that?

01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:12.700
I mean, it’s something not possible.

01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:15.730
That’s what you all people should know.

01:16:15.730 --> 01:16:18.660
Also we should reconcile to that.

01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:21.070
I have done my level best.

01:16:21.070 --> 01:16:26.360
Except for standing on my head I have done
everything that is possible but what I find

01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:28.250
is that it’s very difficult.

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:29.250
Too much of ego!

01:16:29.250 --> 01:16:30.250
Too much.

01:16:30.250 --> 01:16:33.990
Too much of ego in the West – absolutely
– and they are so ignorant.

01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:36.910
They have never heard the name of Kundalini,
can you imagine?

01:16:36.910 --> 01:16:39.040
What tremendous ignorance there is.

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:44.750
But those who are wise, those who have pure
intelligence, came to Sahaja Yoga, they learnt

01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:46.300
everything, they know so much.

01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:53.250
And some of the Sahaja Yogis in the West know
more than Indians know, I know.

01:16:53.250 --> 01:16:57.790
We can say that there are many good Indian
Sahaja Yogis but there are some excellent

01:16:57.790 --> 01:16:59.960
ones in the West.

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:05.890
Par excellence, I should say, some of them
are.

01:17:05.890 --> 01:17:08.960
So that’s it.

01:17:09.426 --> 01:17:10.426
So why worry?

01:17:10.426 --> 01:17:17.926
We have the quality, if not the quantity.

01:17:17.926 --> 01:17:22.226
But this quality only is going to attract
these ego people.

01:17:22.226 --> 01:17:24.626
That’s only going to attract them, nothing
else.

01:17:24.626 --> 01:17:29.176
This quality of your personality, of your
temperament, of your behaviour, everything

01:17:29.176 --> 01:17:30.576
is going to attract them.

01:17:30.576 --> 01:17:37.926
But supposing tomorrow you say, “Alright,
I’ll make a holey jeans,” and walk about

01:17:37.926 --> 01:17:48.856
with the holes in the jeans and then people
will say, “What a nice Sahaja Yogi he is!”

01:17:48.856 --> 01:17:52.366
It’s not the way!

01:17:52.366 --> 01:17:55.336
You must have your own personality, you must
have your own dignity.

01:17:55.336 --> 01:17:57.496
You shouldn’t behave like them.

01:17:57.496 --> 01:17:59.596
But you should not condemn them either.

01:17:59.596 --> 01:18:00.616
Know that they are ignorant.

01:18:00.616 --> 01:18:01.616
They have no idea.

01:18:01.616 --> 01:18:04.506
They don’t have the knowledge of the roots
at all.

01:18:04.506 --> 01:18:14.096
You have the knowledge, so you have to be
kind like a teacher is kind to his students.

01:18:14.096 --> 01:18:18.126
I never expected that in the West I’ll be
able to talk to so many people myself.

01:18:18.126 --> 01:18:25.476
I mean, in the beginning when I came here
they used to say, “This Victorian old woman!”

01:18:25.476 --> 01:18:27.346
And all kinds of things they branded me with.

01:18:27.346 --> 01:18:28.346
So it’s alright.

01:18:28.346 --> 01:18:29.346
I didn’t mind that time.

01:18:29.346 --> 01:18:30.866
Now they are alright.

01:18:30.866 --> 01:18:34.676
That’s how they are, what can you do?

01:18:34.676 --> 01:18:38.516
To begin with they brand you, they do this
and do that.

01:18:38.516 --> 01:18:39.516
Hmm.

01:18:39.516 --> 01:18:42.946
Any other question?

01:18:42.946 --> 01:18:49.766
But the society you can form and get to people
who believe in a proper life, a healthy life

01:18:49.766 --> 01:18:51.846
and healthy society.

01:18:51.846 --> 01:18:56.146
You can start a society like that, saying
that, “We want to belong to the healthy

01:18:56.146 --> 01:18:57.146
society."

01:18:57.146 --> 01:18:58.826
You can take your children to that kind of
a thing.

01:18:58.826 --> 01:19:02.316
You can get other children: where there are
no drugs and things like that.

01:19:02.316 --> 01:19:04.156
You can start on that level.

01:19:04.156 --> 01:19:09.186
Maybe from there you might get some people.

01:19:09.186 --> 01:19:16.576
Anything else?

01:19:16.576 --> 01:19:35.266
Gavin Brown: Shri Mataji, whenever you speak
the questions go away!

01:19:35.266 --> 01:19:37.716
Shri Mataji: You jump into thoughtless awareness,
I know that.

01:19:37.716 --> 01:19:47.076
Gavin Brown: There’s one thing we’d like
to ask you is to accept your birthday present

01:19:47.076 --> 01:19:48.076
a little early.

01:19:48.076 --> 01:19:49.076
Shri Mataji: A birthday present?

01:19:49.076 --> 01:19:57.386
I mean if you have so many birthdays I’ll
become older very fast! (laughter)

01:19:57.386 --> 01:20:00.046
Oh, Gavin.

01:20:00.046 --> 01:20:02.716
So sweet!

01:20:02.716 --> 01:20:09.366
Gavin Brown: Something very little.

01:20:09.366 --> 01:20:14.976
Shri Mataji: You always say so!

01:20:14.976 --> 01:20:18.526
Thank you very much.

01:20:18.526 --> 01:20:20.296
Thank you.

01:20:20.296 --> 01:20:32.726
(applause) You better open and show them,
I don’t know what it is like.

01:20:32.726 --> 01:21:05.546
They’ll be very happy to see that.

01:21:05.546 --> 01:21:09.826
Those who have got Left Vishuddhi, I would
suggest you sit down with your left hand towards

01:21:09.826 --> 01:21:13.756
me and one hand on the Mother Earth – will
solve the problem immediately.

01:21:13.756 --> 01:21:17.336
Just have it.

01:21:17.336 --> 01:21:19.726
Left Vishuddhi.

01:21:19.726 --> 01:21:21.606
Call your mother here.

01:21:21.606 --> 01:21:35.216
Let her have a candle.

01:21:35.216 --> 01:21:42.396
Left hand towards me and right hand [on Mother
Earth].

01:21:42.396 --> 01:21:47.846
What’s it Gavin?

01:21:47.846 --> 01:21:56.936
It’s quite a big thing.

01:21:56.936 --> 01:22:04.206
It’s so many pieces.

01:22:04.206 --> 01:22:11.126
I hope not you have spent so much money.

01:22:11.126 --> 01:22:24.316
You can say the mantra in your heart, “Mother
I am not guilty."

01:22:24.316 --> 01:22:35.656
First [for] your mother, just give her this
candle.

01:22:35.656 --> 01:22:36.726
What’s that?

01:22:36.726 --> 01:22:37.796
Oh Gavin!

01:22:37.796 --> 01:22:39.396
Beautiful isn’t it?

01:22:39.396 --> 01:22:40.396
And a dolphin there!

01:22:40.396 --> 01:22:41.396
Just imagine!

01:22:41.396 --> 01:22:44.716
Thank you very much it’s beautiful.

01:22:44.716 --> 01:22:47.116
It’s beautiful.

01:22:47.116 --> 01:22:51.916
It’s very, very beautiful.

01:22:51.916 --> 01:22:53.116
Beautiful.

01:22:53.116 --> 01:22:57.916
Thank you very much.

01:22:57.916 --> 01:22:59.116
Haa!

01:22:59.116 --> 01:23:03.916
Gavin Brown: It’s French.

01:23:03.916 --> 01:23:08.716
Shri Mataji: It’s French?

01:23:08.716 --> 01:23:11.756
Why not get something English from English?

01:23:11.756 --> 01:23:12.756
Alright.

01:23:12.756 --> 01:23:14.496
It’s alright.

01:23:14.496 --> 01:23:18.146
For me it’s alright.

01:23:18.146 --> 01:23:19.146
Aha.

01:23:19.146 --> 01:23:28.446
Working out!

01:23:28.446 --> 01:23:37.826
Better?

01:23:37.826 --> 01:23:42.576
Cancer patients should be treated with this,
those who have got cancer or anything left-sided,

01:23:42.576 --> 01:23:44.776
psychosomatic.

01:23:44.776 --> 01:23:48.806
The other day, doctor – you will be amazed
– there was a lady who came, she had cancer

01:23:48.806 --> 01:23:54.236
of the glands and she had tied up her head
with a scarf, in Madras.

01:23:54.236 --> 01:23:58.526
So while talking I told her, “You take a
candle and sit there with your left hand towards

01:23:58.526 --> 01:24:02.326
me and right hand outside."

01:24:02.326 --> 01:24:04.646
And after ten minutes I said, “Alright,
remove your scarf."

01:24:04.646 --> 01:24:10.736
The whole thing was cured.

01:24:10.736 --> 01:24:13.656
It’s tremendous.

01:24:13.656 --> 01:24:22.186
And they have now started that PhD thing in
India.

01:24:22.186 --> 01:24:28.296
Better?

01:24:28.296 --> 01:24:40.506
Much better.

01:24:40.506 --> 01:24:52.486
It’s working out.

01:24:52.486 --> 01:24:58.096
Good.

01:24:58.096 --> 01:25:15.190
(Shri Mataji talks to some children)

01:25:15.756 --> 01:25:25.516
Akshay, you didn’t give me a kiss!

01:25:25.516 --> 01:25:38.576
You must give me a kiss too!

01:25:38.576 --> 01:25:45.466
Alright give it to Olympia then!

01:25:45.466 --> 01:25:46.766
Feeling shy!

01:25:46.766 --> 01:25:49.916
So I think I’ll take your leave Gavin.

01:25:49.916 --> 01:25:51.016
Is it alright?

01:25:51.016 --> 01:26:24.696
So tomorrow I don’t think you can come early
in the morning, it’s too early – to the

01:26:24.696 --> 01:26:29.586
airport.

01:26:29.586 --> 01:26:54.986
And I’ll be leaving about seven o’clock
from the house, at seven thirty-five I’ll

01:26:54.986 --> 01:26:55.996
be there.

01:26:55.996 --> 01:26:57.406
Are you alright now?

01:26:57.406 --> 01:26:58.406
Good?

01:26:58.406 --> 01:26:59.406
So where’s the baby?

01:26:59.406 --> 01:27:00.406
Where’s Wendy’s baby?

01:27:00.406 --> 01:27:01.896
Rodrigo Sanchez-Castro: It’s in Southampton
Mother.

01:27:01.896 --> 01:27:03.486
Shri Mataji: Oh I see.

01:27:03.486 --> 01:27:07.886
So you want to have the name?

01:27:07.886 --> 01:27:12.796
When was she born?

01:27:12.796 --> 01:27:24.506
Rodrigo Sanchez-Castro: She was born on the
thirteen of February.

01:27:24.506 --> 01:27:29.676
Shri Mataji: So call her ‘Himakanya’.

01:27:29.676 --> 01:27:38.696
Himakanya is the name of the Goddess born
when…’Hima’ means ‘the snow’.

01:27:38.696 --> 01:27:58.296
That’s the time she was born, when it was
snowing.

01:27:58.296 --> 01:28:09.156
Rodrigo Sanchez-Castro: It’s a boy Mother.

01:28:09.156 --> 01:28:12.146
Shri Mataji: No.

01:28:12.146 --> 01:28:14.146
Then ‘Himanshu’.

01:28:14.146 --> 01:28:17.136
‘Himanshu’ is alright.

01:28:17.136 --> 01:28:20.136
It’s a boy.

01:28:20.136 --> 01:28:23.536
I thought it’s a girl they said.

01:28:23.536 --> 01:28:25.796
Rodrigo Sanchez-Castro: No, no.

01:28:25.796 --> 01:28:28.056
It’s a boy Mother.

01:28:28.056 --> 01:28:30.886
Shri Mataji: Alright, so ‘Himanshu’.

01:28:30.886 --> 01:28:32.016
It’s good.

01:28:32.016 --> 01:28:34.026
‘Himanshu’ is a good name.

01:28:34.026 --> 01:28:44.256
‘Himanshu’ means ‘the one who is born
out of the..’ ‘anshu’ means ‘the essence’

01:28:44.256 --> 01:28:46.396
‘Hima’ means ‘the ice’.

01:28:46.396 --> 01:28:48.306
He’s the essence of the ice.

01:28:48.306 --> 01:28:49.306
‘Himanshu’.

01:28:49.306 --> 01:28:51.016
Is the name of Shiva.

01:28:51.016 --> 01:28:58.766
(Mother meets another young child)

01:28:58.766 --> 01:29:07.306
This is a new one?

01:29:07.306 --> 01:29:15.096
New Sahaja Yogini?

01:29:15.096 --> 01:29:17.696
Aaah.

01:29:17.696 --> 01:29:22.896
That’s Leela.

01:29:22.896 --> 01:29:27.426
You want some chana?

01:29:27.426 --> 01:29:34.596
Leela’s sister: She likes that.

01:29:34.596 --> 01:29:49.116
Shri Mataji: Do

01:29:49.116 --> 01:29:50.716
you like that?

01:29:50.716 --> 01:29:55.346
Alright, I’ll give her some chana.

01:29:55.346 --> 01:30:06.846
Now only two can fit in here and let’s fit
the others there.

01:30:06.846 --> 01:30:07.866
Alright.

01:30:07.866 --> 01:30:12.976
So you carry some more.

01:30:12.976 --> 01:30:14.576
She has big hands now!

01:30:14.576 --> 01:30:16.886
Come along, have some more.

01:30:16.886 --> 01:30:18.106
You have big, big hands now.

01:30:18.106 --> 01:32:06.586
You’ve become a big girl I must say!
