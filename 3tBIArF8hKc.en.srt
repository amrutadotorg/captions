00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,492
﻿Navaratri Puja, Just Surrender
Hampstead, London (UK), 19 October 1980

2
00:00:01,646 --> 00:00:11,511
So you have already heard about the importance of today
in the life of the Goddess.

3
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:15,797
And that today is Ravana was killed

4
00:00:15,857 --> 00:00:19,680
and that’s how there were celebrations.

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,198
It still reflects itself [unsure]

6
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:32,584
As you know very well

7
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:39,159
that all the satanic forces
which one had to face one at the time

8
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:46,916
are all back on the stage
and they are to be defeated.

9
00:00:48,273 --> 00:00:51,214
The greatest problem of modern times is

10
00:00:51,853 --> 00:00:56,903
that these satanic forces
have taken a very subtle form

11
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,415
and they enter into your psyches and into your egos.

12
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,717
And you are the saints, you are the bhaktas,
you are the devotees of the Goddess.

13
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:14,999
It’s a very delicate situation
when the confusion is there.

14
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:25,536
When the saints are attacked,
the aggressor can be removed,

15
00:01:25,678 --> 00:01:34,524
but the saint becomes mixed up
or confused with negative forces,

16
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:38,791
which is very difficult to make him see the light.

17
00:01:40,332 --> 00:01:43,198
And you have seen this situation very well.

18
00:01:44,741 --> 00:01:47,941
And the subtler you grow, the subtler they became.

19
00:01:48,662 --> 00:01:56,204
And they start giving you ideas
which are so negative,

20
00:01:56,428 --> 00:01:59,027
but you cannot see them.

21
00:02:03,012 --> 00:02:08,403
So the problem today is very delicate.

22
00:02:10,768 --> 00:02:15,802
There are no absolute saints
and there are no absolute bad people.

23
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:17,879
Such a mixture, a confusion,

24
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:22,404
that is what is Kali Yuga is,
these modern times are.

25
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:29,907
The only way to get rid of them is to surrender.

26
00:02:32,047 --> 00:02:35,643
That is the only way,
there is no other way around.

27
00:02:37,053 --> 00:02:39,443
Because when you surrender,

28
00:02:39,884 --> 00:02:46,913
the spirits, the negativities,
the satanic forces just disappear

29
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,542
because they are not effective.

30
00:02:52,165 --> 00:02:54,017
They have no business to be there.

31
00:02:54,236 --> 00:02:59,585
They have no interest in a person
who is surrendered to God.

32
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:03,265
They cannot surrender.

33
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:08,165
If they surrender, they’ll also become saints.

34
00:03:12,381 --> 00:03:19,315
All the time to think: “What are my catches?
What are my negativities?” Is not going to help you.

35
00:03:20,187 --> 00:03:22,955
Just surrender all these ideas that are coming to you

36
00:03:23,057 --> 00:03:27,715
and you’ll find that all absurd ideas will run away.

37
00:03:28,884 --> 00:03:34,785
This is the easiest way to get rid of your problems,
is just to surrender.

38
00:03:36,185 --> 00:03:50,907
After all, all these horrible people,
all the horrible deities, enemies,

39
00:03:52,101 --> 00:04:04,493
who came forward to fight the Goddess, are there
as long as you nurture them.

40
00:04:05,975 --> 00:04:10,323
As soon as you surrender yourself,

41
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:14,375
they find you of no
use for themselves

42
00:04:14,523 --> 00:04:18,113
and they go to other half-baked people.

43
00:04:21,815 --> 00:04:26,047
The growth will only come,
when the surrender is complete.

44
00:04:30,451 --> 00:04:33,984
One has to know that the powers are tremendous.

45
00:04:36,822 --> 00:04:39,438
You cannot conceive it as it is said by Markandeya.

46
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:43,601
You cannot conceive it;
it is beyond your conception.

47
00:04:44,136 --> 00:04:48,999
Outwardly you cannot understand,
you just cannot understand.

48
00:04:52,554 --> 00:04:56,598
Under such circumstances,
the best thing is to surrender yourself.

49
00:04:57,456 --> 00:04:59,950
Now with surrendering, what do you surrender?

50
00:05:00,214 --> 00:05:05,812
What do you surrender?
It’s your ego and your super-ego

51
00:05:06,801 --> 00:05:12,203
and it is completely cleansed and drenched
in the blessing.

52
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,820
Because you cannot give anything,

53
00:05:16,204 --> 00:05:18,196
you have to receive the blessings

54
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:22,815
and to receive the blessings
you have to just surrender.

55
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:24,828
It is so simple.

56
00:05:25,211 --> 00:05:30,733
The easiest way to solve all your problems
is to surrender.

57
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:39,898
Just say: “I surrender”.
For Realized souls this should be their mantra.

58
00:05:40,764 --> 00:05:44,921
And you will be amazed
how all your problems will vanish.

59
00:05:47,093 --> 00:05:51,004
Because not only that the powers are tremendous,

60
00:05:53,564 --> 00:05:56,113
but as you are Realized souls

61
00:05:56,988 --> 00:06:02,450
all the divine Forces, all the divine Deities,

62
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:05,817
all the Eternal Beings, Chiranjivas,

63
00:06:06,388 --> 00:06:09,497
all the angels and the ganas,

64
00:06:10,086 --> 00:06:12,309
all of them are looking after you.

65
00:06:12,965 --> 00:06:17,720
But they know one thing, those who are surrendered
and those who are not surrendered.

66
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,519
You just surrender the problem,

67
00:06:22,204 --> 00:06:26,032
and you will be surprised that
the answer will come in such a miraculous way.

68
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:32,214
Just surrender. Do not take any responsibility
upon yourself. Just surrender.

69
00:06:33,645 --> 00:06:39,003
Because how far you can go into the solution?
Up to your rationality.

70
00:06:39,657 --> 00:06:45,310
Beyond that you are your Spirit,
and the Spirit is connected to the Divine.

71
00:06:46,036 --> 00:06:48,099
So best is to surrender

72
00:06:48,871 --> 00:06:55,696
and the whole thing will show such light
and such beauty and such meaning.

73
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:03,828
In the modern times now the work is not the same way
as it was where it is described,

74
00:07:04,301 --> 00:07:12,617
when the Raudrarupa or that the Chandrarupa
you see there, was there at the back.

75
00:07:15,604 --> 00:07:22,422
It’s a mine work, it’s a Mother,
it’s a simple, loving, compassionate.

76
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:31,917
For your protection, this rupa is there,
but you do not see it.

77
00:07:33,429 --> 00:07:36,708
You are completely protected, be sure of it.

78
00:07:41,651 --> 00:07:46,916
And all your powers after Realization
of giving Kundalini awakening,

79
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:52,599
or of curing people, or of talking about
Sahaja Yoga, or spreading it,

80
00:07:52,868 --> 00:07:58,905
any, any kind of thing that you want
is all granted, is all flowing through.

81
00:08:02,584 --> 00:08:05,186
And as you know, that there are many saints, who have said,

82
00:08:05,257 --> 00:08:12,372
that “Why these Sahaja Yogis,
they should be granted this great boon?”

83
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:16,493
So one can say it’s a whim, all right.

84
00:08:20,231 --> 00:08:22,213
There is one more thing.

85
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:29,757
I was happy to learn that the great poet of this country,
Blake, had prophesied about Me.

86
00:08:29,973 --> 00:08:35,308
And it is so beautifully done, that He said that
England is going to be the Jerusalem.

87
00:08:35,693 --> 00:08:37,921
This is going to be the pilgrimage.

88
00:08:38,538 --> 00:08:40,218
The venue has shifted.

89
00:08:41,141 --> 00:08:43,022
And then He has very beautifully-

90
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:47,797
have you got the thing to read?
Oh, haven’t brought it.

91
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:51,091
But what reading, that He has said that

92
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:57,399
first the furnace will be burning in Surrey Hills,
where I came first,

93
00:08:57,811 --> 00:09:01,926
and then He has mentioned Lambeth Vale,
where we have got our Ashram,

94
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:05,208
where the foundations will be laid,
we have laid the foundations.

95
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,316
And that Jerusalem is going to be in England, not in India.

96
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:15,623
And you are the people
responsible for this Jerusalem.

97
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:28,821
Today is the day for which
in India everybody is doing Puja.

98
00:09:30,308 --> 00:09:36,898
And all the Sahaja Yogis today,
in every center there is a Puja today.

99
00:09:38,123 --> 00:09:40,703
And they are all thinking of you people.

100
00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:54,101
So you have to receive the supreme bliss today,
the supreme bliss, only by surrender.

101
00:09:54,888 --> 00:09:57,288
Today the vibrations are tremendous.

102
00:09:57,579 --> 00:10:00,590
Keep all your doubts and all your nonsensical things outside.

103
00:10:01,131 --> 00:10:03,589
Just receive it and get it.

104
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,310
These things are going to help you, nothing else.

105
00:10:07,562 --> 00:10:10,617
Because you don’t have to give Me anything,
but receive it yourself.

106
00:10:10,956 --> 00:10:13,310
Receive it as much as you can.

107
00:10:23,218 --> 00:10:32,398
This Havan you know is a very good thing
for reciting the name of the Goddess.

108
00:10:33,119 --> 00:10:36,410
Her eyes are given by fire, [Agni] as they say,

109
00:10:38,003 --> 00:10:45,310
and in that light, in that fire,
in the name of Goddess,

110
00:10:45,591 --> 00:10:47,600
we awaken our Deities within us

111
00:10:48,322 --> 00:10:57,102
and burn away all that is wrong in these particular chakras
which invoke those powers.

112
00:10:58,469 --> 00:11:01,118
So with devotion and understanding you have to do it.

113
00:11:01,198 --> 00:11:05,304
Because you are really privileged people, today,
extremely privileged.

114
00:11:05,942 --> 00:11:10,709
Be proud of that,
and do with that devotion all these things.

115
00:11:12,116 --> 00:11:14,929
Today is a very much better time

116
00:11:15,015 --> 00:11:21,912
because the Dashara and the Navaratri,
both are combined at this time.

117
00:11:22,669 --> 00:11:24,740
And so it has worked out very well.

118
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:27,399
We should do it with full devotion.

119
00:11:28,047 --> 00:11:36,897
I think very few people can put in the fire,
but we can all do symbolically and say this.

120
00:11:37,142 --> 00:11:40,419
And how many names do you want to take away?

121
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,614
Hundred-and-eight?

122
00:11:43,757 --> 00:11:44,328
Sahaja Yogi: Thousand.

123
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:45,584
Shri Mataji: “What’s it?

124
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,212
Shri Mataji: You would like to thousand?
That is a good idea.

125
00:11:48,316 --> 00:11:50,630
If you have that much devotion
it will be the best

126
00:11:50,695 --> 00:11:53,025
because it will about take two hours
at the most, at the most.

127
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,761
Not two hours, I think one hour if we go fast.

128
00:11:56,264 --> 00:11:57,841
Will you be able to say all that?

129
00:11:57,915 --> 00:11:59,213
Do you think it’s easy?”

130
00:11:59,475 --> 00:12:00,995
Sahaja Yogi: “Yes.”

131
00:12:01,778 --> 00:12:03,978
Shri Mataji: “One thousand names.

132
00:12:05,214 --> 00:12:07,321
Or else, you can give food to children.

133
00:12:07,512 --> 00:12:08,956
They will be tired.

134
00:12:09,088 --> 00:12:12,783
What do you think?
Let’s try it.

135
00:12:15,771 --> 00:12:17,592
In India they would do one thousand.

136
00:12:17,762 --> 00:12:23,311
Sahaja Yogi: Then we will do thousand.
