00:12:55.141 --> 00:13:00.656
Today is very bigger day for us,
also 'vasant panchami' is there

00:13:01.617 --> 00:13:05.306
Again it's national day today

00:13:05.674 --> 00:13:10.171
The people are grateful to see this day

00:13:10.553 --> 00:13:13.306
How many people had abandoned their life?.

00:13:14.175 --> 00:13:20.675
How many things have happened,
but we have not yet come to that stage.

00:13:20.885 --> 00:13:28.478
Where you know this,Yes,
the country is of great

00:13:28.503 --> 00:13:34.986
importance,People have
won the sacrifice.

00:13:35.011 --> 00:13:39.575
Even when we called up
the rebellion in this

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:44.780
country, Gandhiji thought
that this country's

00:13:46.856 --> 00:13:50.502
That which is real wealth,
it is spiritual.

00:13:50.477 --> 00:13:54.224
Self-power is not violent
but non-violence, and

00:13:54.249 --> 00:13:57.995
therefore they will make
all over non-violence.

00:13:58.492 --> 00:14:02.242
We have won the country for
without any violence

00:14:02.499 --> 00:14:06.447
When this happened,
we do not realize that

00:14:06.472 --> 00:14:10.273
Now this is what we have
earned so much wealth,

00:14:10.861 --> 00:14:14.619
Yes, that's what we keep,
Yes, you has got diamonds

00:14:14.637 --> 00:14:17.381
In Which sacrifice to fit?

00:14:17.676 --> 00:14:23.476
So that's what it's sacrificing
They must be of this soil

00:14:23.293 --> 00:14:30.295
Whatever the sacrifice of this soil,
They have sacrificed themselves.

00:14:30.236 --> 00:14:31.983
You have nothing else to do.

00:14:31.983 --> 00:14:34.809
What is the main thing in
this country,that is, all the

00:14:34.834 --> 00:14:37.484
space that is the element,the
power of self, it is..

00:14:37.484 --> 00:14:41.985
That should be discarded on self-power.

00:14:41.985 --> 00:14:46.896
As long as the sacrifice of independence
will not be put on self-centeredness,

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:48.795
The welfare of this country will not be there

00:14:49.148 --> 00:14:54.792
But for that, we should create such a people,
which has received this self-discipline.

00:14:54.916 --> 00:15:01.416
But I still see that the people that got self-conscious
Who has gained self-confidence

00:15:01.785 --> 00:15:10.685
They are still playing very tightly and
are living with a very frantic situation.

00:15:11.152 --> 00:15:16.408
The kind of thing that has happened to
me is so troubled me yesterday

00:15:16.143 --> 00:15:20.391
I have decided that I do not want to
talk about that anymore.

00:15:22.111 --> 00:15:24.366
Relations,How did it come?

00:15:24.366 --> 00:15:27.614
We say relation come in Maharashtra.

00:15:27.614 --> 00:15:30.866
Brothers kill you after one another

00:15:30.866 --> 00:15:34.120
Something bothered, what happened to it?

00:15:34.485 --> 00:15:36.988
That's because we took addiction.

00:15:37.481 --> 00:15:40.057
You might be surprised if
you add some additives to

00:15:40.082 --> 00:15:42.733
Vishuddhi chakra,
you do not have any kind of wisdom.

00:15:42.733 --> 00:15:44.642
He does not live nicely.

00:15:44.642 --> 00:15:50.643
He lied and did not think he had
missed anything even though he did

00:15:50.643 --> 00:15:56.396
This addiction has grown so much in
our country and it's on such a large scale,

00:15:56.396 --> 00:16:00.895
People do not notice that they are suffering,

00:16:01.893 --> 00:16:04.398
People say so many lies about.

00:16:04.398 --> 00:16:06.645
They are behaving so badly.

00:16:06.645 --> 00:16:09.646
And so much lies are in the world

00:16:09.646 --> 00:16:12.146
Yes, for the first time
to get rid of falsehood,

00:16:12.171 --> 00:16:14.391
first of all should be
left with addiction.

00:16:14.215 --> 00:16:18.711
The man who does not completely forget to addiction,
His nature will not be good.

00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:27.211
He will do falsehood, he will do a false thing
and everything that is true will be false

00:16:27.211 --> 00:16:32.712
So one day on this big day many
people spend their lives

00:16:32.712 --> 00:16:34.298
Many gave life

00:16:34.663 --> 00:16:36.863
Many have shed their blood

00:16:36.545 --> 00:16:44.437
From this time immemorial, we struggled for independence,
now for self-rule, to self-help

00:16:44.814 --> 00:16:49.023
People today pledge that we will
not do any addiction anymore

00:16:49.023 --> 00:16:50.024
Any kind

00:16:50.522 --> 00:16:52.022
This is not a difficult task

00:16:52.523 --> 00:16:55.774
I see people from foreign countries
that they are so sharp

00:16:55.774 --> 00:16:59.775
Once that is achieved, on the next day
it becomes free, by leaving everything,

00:16:59.775 --> 00:17:02.529
That was not what they were

00:17:03.271 --> 00:17:07.032
As soon as a lotus comes up in a moment,
it gets so much sweeter

00:17:07.032 --> 00:17:09.026
But not in our country.

00:17:09.026 --> 00:17:11.773
There are some types of activities in our country

00:17:12.004 --> 00:17:13.403
But this is the only way,
It's gonna be there.

00:17:13.403 --> 00:17:18.404
For ten ten years, peoples in sahajayoga
Why not make some progress?

00:17:18.404 --> 00:17:22.903
The reason is that they have not been
able to relieve themselves of addiction.

00:17:23.657 --> 00:17:25.402
This slavery should gone

00:17:25.402 --> 00:17:27.369
The slaughter of addiction is that it should go.

00:17:27.867 --> 00:17:30.863
The second guru's slavery is very terrible to you

00:17:31.113 --> 00:17:33.366
I met a gentleman yesterday

00:17:33.615 --> 00:17:35.113
They were so many years in sahajayoga.

00:17:35.113 --> 00:17:37.368
But his master's slavery is not gone

00:17:37.368 --> 00:17:39.366
So they are still in trouble.

00:17:39.614 --> 00:17:41.116
There is no one listening to these things

00:17:41.116 --> 00:17:42.623
Nobody would believe it.

00:17:42.623 --> 00:17:49.112
But if your guru is wrong, then you have
seen that you are suffering from it

00:17:49.861 --> 00:17:51.620
This slavery,
Should have gone

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:56.874
You should keep in mind that for slavery,
People who come from Guru.

00:17:56.715 --> 00:17:58.963
They are physically afflicted

00:17:58.963 --> 00:18:05.212
If your master can not keep your body properly,
then why should such a guru be enslaved?

00:18:05.716 --> 00:18:08.217
This is superstition and it is a vengeful sign.

00:18:08.321 --> 00:18:13.328
In the vengeful symptom, Shrikrishna said,
that when a person becomes vengeful

00:18:13.328 --> 00:18:16.827
Then some unfixed things are
pulled up completely

00:18:16.827 --> 00:18:19.824
That condition only believes the truth

00:18:22.321 --> 00:18:27.826
Suppose,one bull tie to the oil extractor poll
and put scarp on eyes,He is wandering in there

00:18:27.826 --> 00:18:31.925
And no matter how much you told him
that he is wrong, he does not think so

00:18:31.925 --> 00:18:33.424
It do not go into his head

00:18:34.428 --> 00:18:37.677
This vengeful tendency is
especially in our Maharashtra.

00:18:37.677 --> 00:18:41.175
The reason we tell him the reason
is that we are very addicted

00:18:41.175 --> 00:18:45.675
And the fundamentalists, in those days
we have grown up in the customs,

00:18:45.675 --> 00:18:48.315
You never stop that fundamental.

00:18:48.813 --> 00:18:53.688
Now first of all, see that you should fast now

00:18:54.433 --> 00:18:56.051
Who said that? Which scripture?

00:18:56.051 --> 00:18:58.055
If no one says so, no one can show.

00:18:58.804 --> 00:19:01.523
If you have a passion to fast anytime.

00:19:01.523 --> 00:19:05.646
So whoever you wish about will be the same.

00:19:06.273 --> 00:19:09.395
People in our country are also starving

00:19:10.898 --> 00:19:15.392
Why should I fast even more,
I do not understand,

00:19:15.647 --> 00:19:18.788
If you would like to fast,then die

00:19:18.788 --> 00:19:23.152
It seems like the future will be hungry,
want fasting, take it.

00:19:25.404 --> 00:19:27.152
You should only get
what you are interested in.

00:19:27.152 --> 00:19:31.491
When you fast,
Then let it be hungry

00:19:31.742 --> 00:19:33.494
Then why cry?

00:19:33.746 --> 00:19:37.760
Everything is for eat and they
do not want to eat it in the name of God

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.764
You should not eat it,
but eat it in the name of God

00:19:41.012 --> 00:19:44.263
Next is the path of devotion,
the path of devotion has drawn one

00:19:44.263 --> 00:19:46.755
But that's not the way it's going to be

00:19:46.755 --> 00:19:48.005
It should be noted

00:19:49.012 --> 00:19:52.875
devotion, exclusive devotion is told by Krishna

00:19:53.123 --> 00:19:59.376
The path of devotion is to sit on the ground,
to walk away from it

00:19:59.842 --> 00:20:02.124
Dress clothes, like beggar

00:20:02.345 --> 00:20:06.580
Going there playing the Manjeera,
And to break the head

00:20:06.834 --> 00:20:07.706
That is called the devotional path

00:20:07.706 --> 00:20:10.202
Who said this?

00:20:12.705 --> 00:20:20.576
Dnyaneshwar did not say that you used to go to
perform 'Hare Rama' Hare, doing there.

00:20:20.576 --> 00:20:24.324
Or do we say Vitthal Vitthal
by doing Krishna Krishna

00:20:24.324 --> 00:20:26.577
So do not go anywhere

00:20:29.575 --> 00:20:31.933
Those who wrote it did not read

00:20:31.933 --> 00:20:34.431
They did not understand
what they explained

00:20:34.431 --> 00:20:40.306
Now it is said that, 'Aata Vishwatmake...Toshawe'.

00:20:40.306 --> 00:20:44.061
He should show the spirit of the universe

00:20:44.061 --> 00:20:46.549
He should be happy

00:20:46.544 --> 00:20:51.954
Whatever sacrifice has been offered to me,
Let's be satisfied

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:56.315
And then what to give?
Give it to Pasaydan

00:20:57.183 --> 00:20:58.937
This pasaydaan is given to you.

00:21:00.434 --> 00:21:03.433
This is what the vibrations have been
given to youvthis is pasaydaan.

00:21:05.434 --> 00:21:08.434
The dark darkness of sinful man
disappeared,did gone?

00:21:09.142 --> 00:21:12.392
Those who played majeera,
Does ignorance go?

00:21:12.892 --> 00:21:18.645
Too dry, dried, beggar
they do not have proper clothes on body.

00:21:19.144 --> 00:21:22.392
Seeing the person coming to cry
Where did the sinful man come from?

00:21:22.392 --> 00:21:26.032
And say we are devotees of Shri hari !

00:21:26.885 --> 00:21:34.882
Hey, who gave Sudama to Dwarka,
this devotee, this beggar people

00:21:36.633 --> 00:21:39.614
Why are you people defaming Krishna?

00:21:39.614 --> 00:21:43.612
Be a devotee of another person,Fraud Babaji's

00:21:43.612 --> 00:21:47.863
Whose rinkle should be counted,
This type of Babaji are many

00:21:48.611 --> 00:21:50.363
Devote them.

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:53.001
But why do you defame Shrikrishna?

00:21:53.251 --> 00:21:56.501
Where did you not read the
description of their face?

00:21:57.255 --> 00:21:59.750
Did not read the description of his brilliance?

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:03.251
Where he was a beggar, nobody told.

00:22:03.251 --> 00:22:09.002
Even though cows maintained,
the crown was on the head.

00:22:10.002 --> 00:22:11.491
We have already heard of it ,
about dress up

00:22:11.491 --> 00:22:15.732
Where did you hear that he was
carrying a bush in his hands beggar ?

00:22:15.732 --> 00:22:18.201
Tobacco filled in drink

00:22:23.201 --> 00:22:24.222
This is our condition

00:22:24.222 --> 00:22:29.122
But do not think about it,
And black ash on the head

00:22:29.373 --> 00:22:31.873
does he apply black ash on head

00:22:33.121 --> 00:22:38.121
How pretty even,Turns the sandal on the head

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:46.171
That was his sign,even if you look around,
why do you walk around with black ash?

00:22:46.171 --> 00:22:48.557
With those black ashes,
it will ruin your ajnya chakra.

00:22:48.582 --> 00:22:52.420
The more you will be in a vengeful perspective.

00:22:54.585 --> 00:22:57.833
But you said that Mataji,
why do you say so?

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:02.411
That is what they want me to tell
and it should tell you

00:23:02.411 --> 00:23:04.701
Then you got the disease
tomorrow, there were cancerous

00:23:04.726 --> 00:23:06.910
diseases, there were diseases
of the vishudhhi chakra

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:10.411
Diseases like this,The disease happened
That is to say,Mataji what's this?

00:23:10.411 --> 00:23:16.052
We are Warkaris(devotee),
that is to blame in God

00:23:16.555 --> 00:23:19.051
This vengeful tendency should have gone

00:23:19.051 --> 00:23:23.042
Walk through the scarf on the eye.
We are in the path of devotion

00:23:23.042 --> 00:23:25.512
Hey, what's the way?

00:23:26.261 --> 00:23:28.514
God has said, Make exclusive devotion

00:23:28.514 --> 00:23:31.061
Krishna has explained it
clearly,That you will give

00:23:31.086 --> 00:23:33.511
me something,pamphlet,
fruit, and he will take it

00:23:33.511 --> 00:23:36.764
But giving it clear that you should
give exclusive devotion

00:23:36.764 --> 00:23:39.261
What else could he do?

00:23:39.762 --> 00:23:41.261
When will exclusive devotion be?

00:23:41.261 --> 00:23:44.741
When you walk aloud with God

00:23:44.991 --> 00:23:46.786
When you feel confident

00:23:46.786 --> 00:23:49.996
Whenever you worship him,
it has something meaning

00:23:50.993 --> 00:23:53.983
We have such an evil
reputation of Krishna everywhere

00:23:53.983 --> 00:23:56.981
Are doing abroad,
doing so here too.

00:23:57.231 --> 00:24:01.483
Where is Lord Krishna and
where are the people of Warakari(devotee).

00:24:01.784 --> 00:24:04.708
I do not see the compilation of the two

00:24:09.036 --> 00:24:16.785
So, whatever we are old, we want
to get the best, best of them

00:24:16.785 --> 00:24:20.032
And that which has been imposed on us,
it should be left

00:24:20.032 --> 00:24:24.040
In the Sahajayoga,
we are doing great devotion

00:24:24.532 --> 00:24:27.955
Everything happens,
but only after self-realization

00:24:27.955 --> 00:24:29.755
Before that we did not do it.

00:24:30.005 --> 00:24:32.506
Secondly, fasting is not what we do

00:24:32.506 --> 00:24:35.758
If you want to fast,then do it,
Now I am fasting already

00:24:36.501 --> 00:24:40.501
I Forever Fasting is done by your grace

00:24:40.501 --> 00:24:43.502
No lunch, no meal in the evening

00:24:43.502 --> 00:24:45.255
Something is going on

00:24:45.255 --> 00:24:48.253
If you do not want me to
fast then I can do it

00:24:48.253 --> 00:24:52.758
But even if you want to do it,
you can do it for yourself or for your body

00:24:53.505 --> 00:24:56.003
But do not tell it as a stomach disorder

00:24:57.255 --> 00:25:01.757
So we need to understand that
we are going to be vigilant,

00:25:01.757 --> 00:25:05.004
Now we do not want to
go to the royal state

00:25:05.004 --> 00:25:08.506
This peopole is other
it is of a political nature.

00:25:08.506 --> 00:25:13.216
What they did not know,
what was wrong and what was good

00:25:13.216 --> 00:25:15.218
The mistake and the good one at all

00:25:15.465 --> 00:25:17.966
That is, we feel that these
people are human or animals !

00:25:17.966 --> 00:25:24.216
They do not understand this, that
they eat cabbage, that they eat shit

00:25:24.216 --> 00:25:28.216
He also does not understand the difference,
People are royaltyers

00:25:28.462 --> 00:25:33.464
And if this state of the state came,
But a big question arises in him

00:25:33.464 --> 00:25:37.968
Because such people are
confused and completely confused

00:25:37.968 --> 00:25:40.038
So do not understand what
they want to explain

00:25:40.038 --> 00:25:43.034
So everyone thinks,
what's wrong with this?

00:25:43.034 --> 00:25:47.910
Now here London is a new one,
Exiting daily.

00:25:47.905 --> 00:25:49.406
Now there's a new one

00:25:49.406 --> 00:25:55.405
The new one happened for four years,
That needle socks into your mouth

00:25:56.675 --> 00:26:03.113
If not, then insert the pin
And paint the hair and go out.

00:26:03.462 --> 00:26:08.114
I said, why do this? they said,
So what's wrong with this?

00:26:08.114 --> 00:26:12.862
What's wrong with this?
Does we have any answer?

00:26:17.253 --> 00:26:19.506
So they do such foolishness

00:26:19.845 --> 00:26:23.595
It does not matter if you say
anything to that stupidity

00:26:23.595 --> 00:26:25.592
Because they think, we all know

00:26:25.592 --> 00:26:26.347
What's wrong or bad?

00:26:26.347 --> 00:26:27.834
What do you say?

00:26:27.834 --> 00:26:30.919
That is, the monsters are
good, the evil is also good,

00:26:30.944 --> 00:26:33.860
the thief one is good and
the Mahatma is also good.

00:26:34.084 --> 00:26:37.331
And God is good. Everything is good,
all are same.

00:26:37.588 --> 00:26:40.832
Hitler is good and krushna is also good.

00:26:40.832 --> 00:26:42.474
There is no difference between them

00:26:42.474 --> 00:26:44.473
No one should say bad .all good

00:26:44.473 --> 00:26:46.470
There is nothing bad to say

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:48.225
This was the stage of royalness

00:26:48.225 --> 00:26:50.225
You now have the royal nature

00:26:50.225 --> 00:26:52.974
Because you are making progress now

00:26:52.974 --> 00:26:54.726
Due to the progressive country you are

00:26:54.726 --> 00:26:58.475
Now there is a humble request that
you should not progress there

00:26:58.475 --> 00:27:01.478
Now we have to make such progress right now

00:27:01.478 --> 00:27:05.429
She wants to progress
through the Crown Chakra and

00:27:05.454 --> 00:27:09.250
That is to make progress
in the higher direction

00:27:09.724 --> 00:27:12.476
For This,What's wrong with this?
What's wrong with him?

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:14.191
Why do this?
why do that?

00:27:14.191 --> 00:27:17.198
If that desire were to happen, we would have
thought that we became a royal

00:27:17.198 --> 00:27:19.695
It's worse than vengeful.

00:27:21.446 --> 00:27:25.222
Because once you can remove
bond,But by the way, From the

00:27:25.247 --> 00:27:29.218
point of view, the restriction on the
eye, how to remove it?

00:27:31.192 --> 00:27:32.944
So,do not go to that situation.

00:27:32.944 --> 00:27:34.942
What's wrong with this
What's wrong in him

00:27:34.942 --> 00:27:37.692
You are your master in Sahajayoga.

00:27:37.692 --> 00:27:42.199
Vibrations come in your hands and
you know what's wrong with you

00:27:42.199 --> 00:27:43.882
Then,Fix Your Vibrations.

00:27:43.882 --> 00:27:47.144
But there is a situation
where people do not understand

00:27:47.169 --> 00:27:49.905
anything, whether we
have lost anything or not

00:27:50.389 --> 00:27:54.388
This situation should not occur

00:27:54.882 --> 00:27:57.387
That is my request by adding my hands

00:27:57.636 --> 00:28:04.640
Today, in this good news, we all have to tell
you that you are born in this holy soil.

00:28:05.136 --> 00:28:08.638
I now go to Coimbatore day before yesterday,
they said that you will live in Pune now ?

00:28:08.638 --> 00:28:10.387
It is said to be punyapattanum.

00:28:10.387 --> 00:28:12.384
All said by adding their hands

00:28:12.485 --> 00:28:23.387
Said, 'Why?'
... now you see it all

00:28:23.638 --> 00:28:27.134
This is what they were .it was
what they were described

00:28:29.385 --> 00:28:37.215
This story tells us that once Pundarikaksh
took his father and mother

00:28:37.215 --> 00:28:39.634
Came to Mumbai city.
Maybe even Pune has come

00:28:39.634 --> 00:28:41.385
There is a story about Pune.
Do not know if there will be any.

00:28:41.882 --> 00:28:45.384
He said to them,
'I'm not taking you anywhere now.

00:28:45.384 --> 00:28:47.327
I have served you very much

00:28:47.823 --> 00:28:50.073
Now,I'm not going to take you forward
Go where you want

00:28:50.073 --> 00:28:56.448
I am not doing your pilgrimage anymore.
He thought, saw the vaibrations and said

00:28:56.448 --> 00:28:58.194
That's it, do it

00:28:58.194 --> 00:29:01.944
You take us out of here anyhow

00:29:02.193 --> 00:29:07.946
Then do what you want to do,
As he picked it out of that village, he came to notice

00:29:07.946 --> 00:29:10.945
That's how much is my fault,
He said, forgive me

00:29:10.945 --> 00:29:12.196
Something happened to me

00:29:12.196 --> 00:29:17.695
No, no, I take you away,
Well, I think this often in Pune

00:29:17.695 --> 00:29:19.191
Mumbai has so much

00:29:19.192 --> 00:29:25.692
But now people should decide that,
to pune

00:29:25.692 --> 00:29:31.196
Which Graduation is given from Anadikal
The great saints, great masters

00:29:31.196 --> 00:29:34.444
will celebrate and will do it well

00:29:34.573 --> 00:29:38.675
Today,All of this should be decided in
the mind of the people of Pune

00:29:38.675 --> 00:29:44.924
That's the name of Pune, that's such a great name,
we get such a great principle

00:29:44.924 --> 00:29:46.176
what others do?

00:29:46.413 --> 00:29:50.917
Others do this,Others do thieves, they do this,
do not want to see others. Others Others

00:29:51.294 --> 00:29:52.500
You are ours.

00:29:52.659 --> 00:30:01.036
What attitude do we leave,Except for small attitude,
we can absorb big ideas

00:30:01.493 --> 00:30:05.493
Secondly, we have the biggest problem
in religion

00:30:06.172 --> 00:30:08.267
Today,have to say about that also

00:30:08.656 --> 00:30:14.644
It is written by Markandey Swaamy about
the idea of ​​caste from Anadikal

00:30:14.729 --> 00:30:16.471
Which is called as consciousness
in all the beings of the

00:30:16.496 --> 00:30:18.364
Goddess The Goddesses who are
situated in power in all castes,

00:30:18.364 --> 00:30:21.186
That's what we say every day,
But why we dont understand?

00:30:21.409 --> 00:30:25.036
Means,Whats goddess cast,
that is our cast

00:30:25.036 --> 00:30:28.607
Mahakali, Mahalaxmi and Mahasaraswati are
only three caste in this world

00:30:28.607 --> 00:30:32.121
And the fourth caste is Aadishakti's,
that's your caste.

00:30:32.458 --> 00:30:33.926
It's Beyond that

00:30:34.292 --> 00:30:38.493
Those who are passionate,
their cast of Mahakali's

00:30:38.625 --> 00:30:42.965
Mahasaraswati's caste for
those who are of Royal

00:30:43.124 --> 00:30:46.140
Those who are righteous,
their castes are Mahalakshmi

00:30:46.219 --> 00:30:50.546
There are three castes in this
way and the fourth which is

00:30:50.571 --> 00:30:54.751
going on is beyond the castes,
that is to say,Trigunatit

00:30:55.489 --> 00:30:58.022
In this situation you are sitting today

00:30:58.111 --> 00:31:01.177
So do not fight on castes

00:31:01.193 --> 00:31:05.657
We are this,we are that,this,that,
Those who really do not really do anything

00:31:06.752 --> 00:31:11.146
With such a brawl,then we say that
why we have given the kingdom to them?

00:31:11.178 --> 00:31:12.740
Means Shivaji was
kunabi(lower cast)

00:31:12.765 --> 00:31:14.299
Why did give the kingdom?

00:31:14.305 --> 00:31:15.475
There are many people who say so

00:31:15.801 --> 00:31:20.991
Now who is sitting on your kingdom?
Parsi is a man coming and sitting,Tell him

00:31:21.166 --> 00:31:28.824
Came all Brahmins and say.tell,
They become friendly with all

00:31:28.949 --> 00:31:31.329
That man is good
But its meaning

00:31:31.338 --> 00:31:37.533
Who has said that?Even if Shivaji Maharaj is in situation,
you give him trouble

00:31:38.105 --> 00:31:42.963
also told Gandhi ji that you
make atonement at Nashik

00:31:43.368 --> 00:31:47.749
You make atonement,
from such a great man

00:31:48.217 --> 00:31:51.768
I once said to Mahatmaji,
'Why do you go to make atonement?

00:31:51.817 --> 00:31:55.213
He said,If I did not go,
they would've shot mi

00:31:56.038 --> 00:31:58.038
Whom did you give up?

00:31:58.832 --> 00:32:04.155
You must remove people from that class,
and this is the idea that you have

00:32:04.235 --> 00:32:06.997
That is, showing others down in religion

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:14.143
Every time that big people were there
Everyone in this country tried this

00:32:14.207 --> 00:32:18.112
That people should remove
this idea from their minds

00:32:18.231 --> 00:32:20.548
eknath feeds water to donkey.

00:32:20.953 --> 00:32:22.793
Naamdev was a tailor.

00:32:23.588 --> 00:32:25.992
We had a gentleman butcher

00:32:26.032 --> 00:32:27.899
He is considered to be a saint.

00:32:27.983 --> 00:32:30.426
Tukaram also always used
to say that If I had

00:32:30.451 --> 00:32:34.314
become a Mahar(lower Caste),
it will good for mi

00:32:34.721 --> 00:32:40.248
Why this?That is, they are often told that
this madness of caste should be gone

00:32:40.965 --> 00:32:42.726
And so many miracles happened

00:32:42.844 --> 00:32:45.762
Their Volume came out in the Indrayani(river)
which was immersed, all happened

00:32:45.786 --> 00:32:47.937
But people have not understand that

00:32:47.953 --> 00:32:51.614
The thing which is holy is different,
the fight between castes is different

00:32:51.794 --> 00:32:54.701
They will not learn because
the eyes are close

00:32:55.621 --> 00:32:58.891
So this kind of caste does not work for us,
We do not want that kind of caste

00:32:58.971 --> 00:33:01.495
We will not do this,
we will not do that

00:33:04.169 --> 00:33:09.232
Such people who speak,
And in this way the people who spread the atmosphere

00:33:09.391 --> 00:33:11.658
There was a defect only in our country

00:33:11.825 --> 00:33:15.111
Well, it still needs to be done in practical terms

00:33:15.206 --> 00:33:18.274
that,some caste boy married with another caste girl

00:33:18.449 --> 00:33:23.988
There is no difference between them
and this kind of marriage, but they have advantages

00:33:24.322 --> 00:33:28.556
Suppose,If you married in your caste
and did Maratha in Marathas

00:33:29.286 --> 00:33:32.405
So, he has not sent anything to Diwali.

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:37.691
How much did dowry?To talk properly,
How much did dowry?

00:33:38.105 --> 00:33:42.183
I want to get married,
then the girl should be the same

00:33:42.446 --> 00:33:46.840
If someone tricks her,
then who will come from the community?

00:33:47.325 --> 00:33:49.454
f you send the girl home,
if didnt give dowry,, But at

00:33:49.479 --> 00:33:51.491
that time can someone is
standing in the community?

00:33:51.825 --> 00:33:57.150
Dies For such castes,
oppressed people torture their girls

00:33:57.285 --> 00:34:01.341
Not only that, I feel that one of
those media is atrocity.

00:34:01.587 --> 00:34:04.259
The girls used to abuse and
torture to them

00:34:04.265 --> 00:34:07.744
It must be married in this caste,
This is a medium

00:34:07.974 --> 00:34:10.561
It is a medium to
persecute those girls

00:34:10.903 --> 00:34:16.023
We are harassing ourselves,
our own, our girls every day.

00:34:17.063 --> 00:34:22.796
If another son got good,If you got good in
the others caste, then what is the problem?

00:34:22.873 --> 00:34:25.611
What should be the problem,
there is no objection

00:34:25.992 --> 00:34:27.125
But it does not look like that

00:34:27.555 --> 00:34:29.155
It is not so practical

00:34:29.301 --> 00:34:34.212
But tomorrow in that caste left our
daughter, So that being helps you

00:34:34.231 --> 00:34:38.894
Even when it appeared front of us,
we got married in our own caste only.

00:34:40.592 --> 00:34:42.401
Stubbornness like this

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:46.893
That is,You really have
something radish on girls head

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:50.367
We're putting a lot of weight

00:34:50.495 --> 00:34:53.832
If you want to, you can do it in
your caste If you want,return it.

00:34:54.046 --> 00:34:56.562
But why do you bother that girl

00:34:56.951 --> 00:35:00.396
Troubled her
tomorrow,mother-in-law troubled her

00:35:00.504 --> 00:35:02.972
You do not go and say
that we married in a caste

00:35:03.036 --> 00:35:06.260
n it you will have a reputation for
being 'we married in our caste'

00:35:06.284 --> 00:35:08.379
What are you going to get?

00:35:08.852 --> 00:35:10.319
Why do you get?

00:35:12.325 --> 00:35:13.925
It is special in womens

00:35:14.321 --> 00:35:15.841
That should be in our caste

00:35:15.874 --> 00:35:20.413
So you have to showoff something after
that What you get? i do not understand.

00:35:21.175 --> 00:35:22.929
Gandhiji tried.

00:35:23.214 --> 00:35:25.747
Tilak made efforts before Gandhiji

00:35:25.935 --> 00:35:28.068
Tilak married widow himself

00:35:29.419 --> 00:35:30.697
Agarkar did

00:35:30.768 --> 00:35:35.847
How many people have tried,
but we have not fulfilled that effort

00:35:36.395 --> 00:35:41.585
Now, when it comes back to sahajayoga,
do not have to do things like casteism

00:35:41.828 --> 00:35:43.954
We do not believe in caste.

00:35:44.026 --> 00:35:47.312
We consider only cast.
that is sahajayoga.

00:35:47.415 --> 00:35:50.795
Sahajaogya is the story of World religions

00:35:51.803 --> 00:35:56.818
This is a world religion and there
is nothing like casteism, hatred etc.

00:35:56.906 --> 00:36:01.179
A single God and all the
people of mankind he created

00:36:01.259 --> 00:36:04.894
Those who have achieved God now,
when they enter the kingdom of God

00:36:04.974 --> 00:36:06.767
Do not take it there,
mad people from here.

00:36:07.141 --> 00:36:09.764
bawannakuli(caste) and this and that

00:36:11.264 --> 00:36:21.511
A gentleman said to me,caste(kul) .talk about
caste mataji, i said ..caste..you have a big.

00:36:21.913 --> 00:36:23.523
caste come from where ?

00:36:23.564 --> 00:36:26.608
Who is your goddess, from there

00:36:26.871 --> 00:36:28.938
That is, the goddess came back or not.

00:36:29.775 --> 00:36:30.975
Which is your kul(caste)?

00:36:31.029 --> 00:36:35.585
If we are of any caste,
our Goddess may be one.

00:36:35.744 --> 00:36:37.608
Suppose someone's goddess is Jagadamba.

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:43.851
hen it can be of a goldsmith or a Brahmin.
it can be Maratha's, anyone can be.

00:36:43.899 --> 00:36:46.398
That is, whether their caste
is for Jagdamba or not.

00:36:46.439 --> 00:36:48.716
That is, the kul(caste) became Jagdamba's

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:52.859
We have Kul(caste) from the Goddess

00:36:53.288 --> 00:36:54.930
Not from the God

00:36:55.256 --> 00:36:59.323
That is, the identity of the kul(caste)
is known on mother, and it is also true

00:37:00.166 --> 00:37:04.967
Thats why we say 'ya devi
sarvabhuteshu,jatiru pen sansthita'

00:37:05.047 --> 00:37:07.325
It's your caste,
This is your caste of greatness

00:37:07.584 --> 00:37:09.893
Now I ask what is
the kul(caste) of Shivaji?

00:37:10.417 --> 00:37:11.544
No one can tell.

00:37:11.606 --> 00:37:14.331
One might say, Jagadamba,
someone would say, Bhavani

00:37:14.402 --> 00:37:15.879
Bhavani was his mother.

00:37:16.173 --> 00:37:17.340
They have a kantyayani.

00:37:17.427 --> 00:37:19.030
kantyayani was his kul(caste).

00:37:19.364 --> 00:37:21.133
kantyayani was his
goddess kul(caste).

00:37:21.546 --> 00:37:24.039
Now, whether it is the Casteism of
their caste or not, do not know

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:25.580
this is Casteism.

00:37:25.675 --> 00:37:26.595
This is kul(caste).

00:37:26.667 --> 00:37:27.897
This is the greatness of kul(caste).

00:37:27.913 --> 00:37:32.395
To get something done,that we are this
much kul(cast) and that much kul(caste)

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:33.737
Type something that does not look like

00:37:33.784 --> 00:37:35.585
All will come together in drinking alcohol.

00:37:35.649 --> 00:37:38.383
If everyone wants to drink alcohol,
then they all sit together and drink.

00:37:38.415 --> 00:37:40.335
Same place

00:37:40.391 --> 00:37:44.327
When drinking,So what
do we drink alcohol?

00:37:44.455 --> 00:37:48.637
But at the time of drinking water,
we wear holy clothes.

00:37:52.373 --> 00:37:54.119
Even if you want to have cigarettes

00:37:54.164 --> 00:37:56.964
If you have half your
remaining thas is also fine

00:37:58.548 --> 00:38:02.972
But at the time of meal, however,
we are very considerate of others.

00:38:03.623 --> 00:38:06.376
That is, if you want to
work in a bad way, you want

00:38:06.401 --> 00:38:09.047
to make a thief,can anyone
ask what's your caste?

00:38:09.287 --> 00:38:12.850
When stolen, they form a team

00:38:12.922 --> 00:38:15.858
When all kind of people steal together

00:38:15.977 --> 00:38:17.296
ame is politics

00:38:17.413 --> 00:38:21.365
Nobody in politics thinks
that, what is your caste?

00:38:21.429 --> 00:38:24.373
When all bad people come
together that means politics.

00:38:25.921 --> 00:38:28.458
But you have to find out
how much you are really bad

00:38:28.721 --> 00:38:30.863
Very bad people

00:38:30.911 --> 00:38:34.149
So this is ours,
just got it right with us.

00:38:38.258 --> 00:38:44.058
This is the situation today that
you have nothing about yourself

00:38:44.362 --> 00:38:47.556
There is no self respect,Because
if there is no demonstration

00:38:47.581 --> 00:38:50.053
of self, then self respect
can come from where?

00:38:50.616 --> 00:38:54.110
It is worthless to say
that things are worthless

00:38:54.435 --> 00:38:56.522
Those things have become so important

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.991
There is no attention
to the real things.

00:38:59.102 --> 00:39:00.324
It's a vengeful symptom

00:39:01.276 --> 00:39:05.376
And this vengeful sign should go through
you, so you have tried your best.

00:39:05.999 --> 00:39:11.400
The vengeful person does not
have any respect for himselfo.

00:39:11.877 --> 00:39:13.441
He does not think about himself.

00:39:13.616 --> 00:39:18.016
I have some self-respect or
should I have some self-respect

00:39:18.346 --> 00:39:19.917
And his whispering all time

00:39:20.164 --> 00:39:22.544
whispering about him,
whispering about them

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:26.187
Something slayess,
which is called in English,like he did

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.766
From here and
there,his whispering

00:39:28.957 --> 00:39:29.957
slayess

00:39:30.569 --> 00:39:34.116
Likewise,
the royal man is a terror but open

00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:37.386
Openly,
the two ,four will slap you

00:39:37.418 --> 00:39:42.285
If someone gave him two or four, he would
give two-four back, but he would openly

00:39:42.697 --> 00:39:43.928
his all apparent

00:39:43.936 --> 00:39:45.071
That is so much that .....

00:39:45.103 --> 00:39:47.317
It is open to sin,
what is bad in it?

00:39:47.547 --> 00:39:49.547
What is worse than doing it?

00:39:49.745 --> 00:39:51.617
What's wrong with that?.
say this

00:39:51.917 --> 00:39:54.464
If you want to do anything,
then there is no such thing in it

00:39:54.489 --> 00:39:57.155
In all things,
what is wrong with it.

00:39:57.359 --> 00:40:00.248
The other is ashamed to see them.
It is a condition

00:40:01.101 --> 00:40:03.957
So what is your
situation, That you know

00:40:04.005 --> 00:40:05.934
Know what is your cast

00:40:06.125 --> 00:40:10.023
And any caste has been
exhausted, means you Drowned.

00:40:10.396 --> 00:40:15.356
Then it should be multiplied
beyond this species

00:40:16.118 --> 00:40:23.082
It should be done in a multiply. And you
must be self-confident in that situation

00:40:23.495 --> 00:40:25.828
His richnees should be seen in him

00:40:26.202 --> 00:40:31.335
The second symptom of Sahajayoga is that he
should always look happy, he should look cool

00:40:31.714 --> 00:40:34.886
Kabirdas said, what do you say,
when you are happy?

00:40:36.014 --> 00:40:38.014
If you do not have fun

00:40:38.672 --> 00:40:40.672
Then you are not sahajayogi.

00:40:41.006 --> 00:40:45.673
If you find this,
We will do anything that Mataji said

00:40:47.263 --> 00:40:48.636
I have seen many people like this.

00:40:48.875 --> 00:40:50.740
I said, what are you doing?

00:40:50.891 --> 00:40:52.319
One thousand people will come.

00:40:52.923 --> 00:40:55.842
How can we do it?
Mother, we will take one thousand or three

00:40:55.867 --> 00:40:59.897
thousand men.What about it,that's
enough when we are 10 people

00:41:00.825 --> 00:41:05.060
It is fun, it is called impudence

00:41:05.211 --> 00:41:09.211
If it does not come,
then you still have not been sahajayogi

00:41:09.537 --> 00:41:11.306
What is in it, mother said.

00:41:11.362 --> 00:41:13.481
Then what is going to
happen and happening

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:17.243
There are many people who
have benefitted from this

00:41:17.322 --> 00:41:19.833
They have seen how
much benefit it has made

00:41:19.964 --> 00:41:20.857
How much did it get

00:41:20.961 --> 00:41:22.373
But it should be anxious.

00:41:22.477 --> 00:41:23.943
Must have fun

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:28.977
If the fun does not appear in the person,
then something has happened

00:41:29.451 --> 00:41:31.435
He did not have seriousness.

00:41:31.713 --> 00:41:35.530
whisperring in all thing,
paying Attention to small things

00:41:35.577 --> 00:41:42.038
Do not want to do that, do not want to
do it, or do something that is all fun

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:45.990
Will be deposed,such things
not suitable to sahajayogi

00:41:46.141 --> 00:41:47.141
Just fine.

00:41:47.467 --> 00:41:51.998
If you do all the fun, then you will be surprised,
what kind of work is done? how things happen?

00:41:52.078 --> 00:41:56.902
You have come into the kingdom of God,
If will not having fun now,then when?

00:41:59.418 --> 00:42:04.558
So all this is a happy
day, It's a day of light,

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:07.898
We got a flag of freedom.

00:42:08.216 --> 00:42:13.874
So I myself in Delhi, saw second flag.
to rising and descending,

00:42:14.484 --> 00:42:18.143
And I said that, this is the beauty
of the flag, it should remain

00:42:18.556 --> 00:42:26.020
And by that grace we all should be
fully integrated with our identity

00:42:27.156 --> 00:42:30.838
Our personality should be
completely integrated only

00:42:31.037 --> 00:42:33.796
That should be fun,
should be joyful

00:42:33.866 --> 00:42:36.763
Everyone should be
involved in the same

00:42:37.247 --> 00:42:40.294
Now these people came
from outside so much.

00:42:40.374 --> 00:42:43.159
I do not have time to talk
to them for two minutes

00:42:43.398 --> 00:42:45.540
It does not take time to sit
near them for two minutes

00:42:45.787 --> 00:42:49.152
They have come from so far, some of them
are such that I have never seen them

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:50.430
They are in the mood

00:42:50.777 --> 00:42:52.768
I did not spend a minute with them

00:42:52.864 --> 00:42:55.356
But they do not feel anything.
In our Maharashtra not llike this

00:42:55.634 --> 00:42:57.308
Mothers did not come to my house.

00:42:57.372 --> 00:42:58.880
Not come to my premises.

00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:03.465
have not been to my center,
My, me, mine is very much.

00:43:03.671 --> 00:43:06.734
And mother did not give time to me,
Give me time.

00:43:07.005 --> 00:43:09.005
I have spent all my time in Maharashtra

00:43:09.239 --> 00:43:11.413
There is no time to talk to these people

00:43:11.422 --> 00:43:14.270
I do not even ask
him, how you are?

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:15.231
To this date.

00:43:15.414 --> 00:43:17.520
How are you ?
It is not even said

00:43:17.735 --> 00:43:19.838
What do they come here,
and what are they?

00:43:20.219 --> 00:43:21.893
means,Thay does not meet.

00:43:22.045 --> 00:43:25.129
Went to their country,
which means that are a little too much

00:43:25.979 --> 00:43:28.121
But they never said that

00:43:28.225 --> 00:43:33.826
Mother, come to me or
come to my home. Talk to me.

00:43:33.945 --> 00:43:34.945
Never

00:43:36.207 --> 00:43:39.723
Well, secondly, if I would go to
someone, then I would go

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:40.850
That's mine

00:43:41.263 --> 00:43:43.263
I would go wherever I want

00:43:43.485 --> 00:43:45.786
I do my convenience

00:43:45.921 --> 00:43:48.873
People will say,
why did you go to their house?

00:43:48.969 --> 00:43:52.422
Hey there, I get convenience there,
so I go, who will you say?

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:55.707
So that's me,
that's why you're going there

00:43:56.232 --> 00:43:57.914
To force me to do so

00:43:58.041 --> 00:44:03.810
But all this is a sign of eloquence and
stupidity, that they should not be so.

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:08.586
So everyone, for two minutes,
come for a minute to me.why?

00:44:09.767 --> 00:44:10.624
Why come?

00:44:10.736 --> 00:44:12.632
What are you going to get?

00:44:12.934 --> 00:44:16.608
troubled me and made me unhappy

00:44:16.855 --> 00:44:18.585
Then,How do i feel happy?

00:44:18.666 --> 00:44:23.871
And how will you get blessings from that
happiness? If you followed my troubles

00:44:24.292 --> 00:44:27.248
So do not insist that to
come my house.

00:44:27.288 --> 00:44:30.042
Come to me.this my should gone.

00:44:30.566 --> 00:44:33.137
Which is your house All
of my houses are there.

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:36.800
My child,

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:40.427
My house, my husband,
This is all vengeful symptom.

00:44:41.326 --> 00:44:46.865
It should be kept in mind that whatever
children do my, me, those children should never

00:44:47.207 --> 00:44:48.460
Can not match.

00:44:48.501 --> 00:44:52.555
you have so much heartache
in it that It's a mistake to

00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:57.982
say that, even if he is a
murderer, then he is the baby.

00:44:59.315 --> 00:45:01.870
So we are a sahajayogi
to get away from him

00:45:01.921 --> 00:45:06.021
How should your child be described? You will
not know unless you stay away and see it

00:45:06.041 --> 00:45:07.675
So do not invlove in it .

00:45:07.787 --> 00:45:11.619
And the society that will be created
by chance, That's the true quality

00:45:12.517 --> 00:45:17.720
He is a true sahajayogi and he will
be blessed with this great work

00:45:18.355 --> 00:45:21.664
May god bless you .

00:45:41.939 --> 00:45:44.614
Gulal etc ...

00:45:52.244 --> 00:45:55.450
Should get some communication back

00:45:55.926 --> 00:45:57.902
One i think that people

00:45:58.021 --> 00:45:59.926
From pune going to mumbai

00:46:00.063 --> 00:46:04.246
Mumbains,Punein,from
there,from nagar

00:46:04.484 --> 00:46:07.992
This,This and the lane in
it, do not remove

00:46:09.737 --> 00:46:14.707
Everyone should meet,Should be in
You must increase love with yourself

00:46:14.874 --> 00:46:18.940
Everyone has given
such a suggestion that

00:46:19.273 --> 00:46:20.964
It would be good for man

00:46:22.202 --> 00:46:24.567
And everyone should travel

00:46:24.591 --> 00:46:27.117
You must meet here and there

00:46:27.347 --> 00:46:29.347
Which today

00:46:29.719 --> 00:46:30.688
Sahajayoga

00:46:30.791 --> 00:46:34.143
It has spread to foreign countries.
Sahajayogi there due to it,Not mi

00:46:35.857 --> 00:46:38.804
Because I do not have so much
time, my home is there

00:46:39.113 --> 00:46:45.844
My husband ia there,So much so Month out of
my tour, Soon there are 14 countries to go

00:46:46.121 --> 00:46:48.531
So I live in a country
for 2 to 3 days

00:46:49.253 --> 00:46:52.916
But these people came here to
themselves, go there from there

00:46:53.082 --> 00:46:56.661
Go and talk to them Make
arrangements everywhere

00:46:56.701 --> 00:46:58.955
It does not matter that there are
four psyche sitting at one place

00:47:01.946 --> 00:47:06.606
People of Pune go to four places It is
necessary to go out and talk to people only

00:47:06.987 --> 00:47:09.598
But you sit in one place
There is a big problem

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:13.822
So it should be taken into mind
That should come among themselves

00:47:14.243 --> 00:47:19.643
And when you get in touch,
It should be done as well for sahajayogi

00:47:19.952 --> 00:47:21.187
Only then will it work

00:47:22.893 --> 00:47:26.862
But that does not mean many people,
Let's know some of that and try to mess it

00:47:26.996 --> 00:47:30.669
Mother said,Then they
go with their bed

00:47:31.367 --> 00:47:34.963
And whose house a month has
stopped He came to and crying

00:47:36.677 --> 00:47:41.328
Hey Mataji stayed for a month,Now
what to do? then you said it only.

00:47:42.836 --> 00:47:45.036
Self-respect i said

00:47:45.448 --> 00:47:49.107
There is no need to stay with anyone
Do it yourself and arrange somewhere

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:52.423
You have two days to go and
meet and ask how you are?

00:47:52.448 --> 00:47:55.596
What's not?, what to do with the
program, and what to do

00:47:56.508 --> 00:47:58.508
Now move on
