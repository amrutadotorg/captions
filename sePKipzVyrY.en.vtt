00:00:00.337 --> 00:00:04.707
Reporter: You know, what I need, is a
meditation to give up all this frustration.

00:00:04.974 --> 00:00:10.294
And until a few years ago, you know, meditation
was thought of as just another kooky alternative

00:00:10.294 --> 00:00:14.756
therapy but over the years there's been
substantial research showing significant

00:00:14.756 --> 00:00:19.412
benefits from clearing the brain and focusing
the mind, always no matter how you do it.

00:00:19.412 --> 00:00:24.208
Taniyala Ongaro's been looking at a study
of meditation in people with headache.

00:00:28.727 --> 00:00:35.267
Subject: My migraine started first with the
normal headache, then they became more and

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:40.193
more intense to the point that I would
vomit. They would just be so debilitating

00:00:40.193 --> 00:00:46.299
that I'm, I wouldn't be able to do anything
- just lie down and wait for the time to pass by and....

00:00:47.856 --> 00:00:53.626
Reporter: Architect, Hardy Castor has suffered
from migraines from past 10 years. She's tried

00:00:53.626 --> 00:01:00.004
just about everything to get some relief.
As a last result, Hardy participated in a

00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:04.412
trial been run by a Sydney Hospital.
Subject: This is the last thing I came

00:01:04.412 --> 00:01:10.216
across and I decided to give it a try even
though I was a bit skeptical about it at first.

00:01:10.216 --> 00:01:13.940
I didn't know if it's going to work, just
like the other things that I've tried and they

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.445
didn't work at all but I gave it a trial
and I'm quite happy that I did that.

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:23.619
Reporter: What Hardy tried was this simple
art of meditation.

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:30.293
Dr. Manocha: Meditation is a very poorly 
understood concept in the West and to give

00:01:30.293 --> 00:01:36.022
you an illustration of that, a recent
survey of Australian GP's show that less

00:01:36.022 --> 00:01:41.210
than 30% of those GP's had any formal
training in meditation or formal

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.728
understanding or education in
what meditation really is.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.749
Reporter: Meditation is said to have
benefits with general health and well being

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:54.605
physically and mentally. It's also said to
help alleviate the symptoms of chronic

00:01:54.605 --> 00:02:01.663
conditions like Asthma and High Blood
Pressure. Dr. Manocha wanted to put these
claims to the test.

00:02:01.946 --> 00:02:05.466
Dr. Manocha: Basically, I was skeptical
as to whether or not we could apply this

00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:12.133
kind of stuff to Western society. Can
the results be reproduced in a culture

00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:20.458
like Australia or a Western country, where
meditation is not widely accepted or not

00:02:20.458 --> 00:02:30.828
as deeply understood and are we able to
produce results using the rigorous Western
scientific protocols?

00:02:31.196 --> 00:02:35.446
Reporter: Meditation is said to release
an energy that travels from the sacrum

00:02:35.446 --> 00:02:41.292
up through the spine, to the head.
It's known as the Kundalini. It travels

00:02:41.292 --> 00:02:47.597
through seven chakras or energy centers.
Each chakra represents sets of organs in

00:02:47.597 --> 00:02:53.585
the body. As this energy reaches the brain,
a mental calm is supposed to be achieved

00:02:53.585 --> 00:02:58.282
and a rebalancing of the body occurs.
Dr. Greg Turek : It was difficult for me

00:02:58.282 --> 00:03:04.045
at first because it has a little bit of an
Eastern flavor and my background is very

00:03:04.045 --> 00:03:10.171
UnEastern, so I found it quite challenging
but because it had a depth to it and truth

00:03:10.171 --> 00:03:17.985
I was sort of, compelled to keep going
and I had more and more health benefits,
more peace of mind.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.130
Reporter: Greg teaches people involved
in a hospital trials. Subjects were split

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.639
into two groups - a meditation group
and a general relaxation group.

00:03:28.977 --> 00:03:32.547
Dr. Manocha: The improvements in the
meditation group were substantially greater

00:03:32.547 --> 00:03:39.486
than those in the control group but we actually
found evidence to suggest that there was

00:03:40.182 --> 00:03:45.322
significantly greater improvement in the
disease process itself, in the meditation

00:03:45.322 --> 00:03:50.378
group, that we didn't see in the control
or comparison group.

00:03:50.677 --> 00:03:56.357
Reporter: Researchers still don't understand
how meditation affects the brain. The study

00:03:56.357 --> 00:04:02.885
enlisted a number of experienced meditators
and submitted them to testing. When people

00:04:02.885 --> 00:04:08.574
relax alpha and delta brain waves are present,
yet when researchers tested this group,

00:04:08.574 --> 00:04:14.039
they were surprised to find theta waves.
Until now, these waves have been difficult

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:19.506
to track and poorly understood.
Dr. Manocha: We actually saw the emergence of

00:04:19.506 --> 00:04:27.165
a well organized pattern of theta wave
activity. It suggests that, meditation is

00:04:27.165 --> 00:04:34.190
not just relaxing or not just experiencing the
alpha state, although that is very much that is well

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:40.897
but is something above and beyond relaxation
and that is supported by our other research which

00:04:40.897 --> 00:04:45.841
showed the significant differences between
the meditation group and the relaxation group.

00:04:46.615 --> 00:04:52.475
Reporter: Well the findings are preliminary.
Grieg and Hardy believe results speak for themselves

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.660
Dr. Greg: The people who do or we tell
them to do, people who do meditate at home

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.083
and do the clearing practices, they all get
some sort of benefit very quickly. Within a

00:05:02.083 --> 00:05:06.122
few weeks they get quite a benefit. You can
see it on their faces. Their faces look clearer,

00:05:06.122 --> 00:05:11.378
they're more positive, they just, the atmosphere
in the group just gets generally better.

00:05:11.378 --> 00:05:16.676
Subject: Even 5 minutes of meditation you
could do before you go out or when you

00:05:16.676 --> 00:05:21.893
come back or before you go to sleep, even
5 minutes of just closing your eyes and

00:05:21.893 --> 00:05:27.529
relaxing yourself a little while, you
know, pays off, so it's worth it.
