00:00:02.603 --> 00:00:07.238
06.10.1983 Shri Ganesha Puja
Vancouver (Canada)

00:00:15.693 --> 00:00:18.599
Now raise your Kundalini.

00:00:19.028 --> 00:00:22.030
All of you raise your Kundalini and tie it up so that

00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:24.824
 it's up there.  Just raise it like that.

00:00:25.482 --> 00:00:31.281
No. This way. This way you should do it. This way.

00:01:07.705 --> 00:01:11.565
In the West, you have grown very big outside,

00:01:11.652 --> 00:01:14.025
like a tree has grown very big.

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:18.681
But it must find its roots, otherwise the whole tree can fall off,

00:01:18.863 --> 00:01:23.615
without nutrition. So you must know the knowledge of the roots.

00:01:23.956 --> 00:01:27.270
Without the knowledge of the roots, the tree has no meaning.

00:01:28.952 --> 00:01:33.275
 So this may be a little new thing for you to understand,

00:01:33.434 --> 00:01:35.978
but you must know ... to know the knowledge of the roots

00:01:36.106 --> 00:01:37.859
 you have to become subtle.

00:01:38.058 --> 00:01:41.769
If you are not a subtle personality you cannot enter into your roots

00:01:42.064 --> 00:01:46.039
and you cannot understand what lies in there.

00:01:46.468 --> 00:01:49.064
So, first of all, I said yesterday,

00:01:49.167 --> 00:01:53.278
you all should get your Realisation, and after your Realisation

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.690
 you can understand this better than anything else.

00:01:58.214 --> 00:01:59.955
Christ came on this earth,

00:02:00.392 --> 00:02:03.371
 but he was only allowed to preach and talk

00:02:03.577 --> 00:02:06.112
 for three and a half years of his life time.

00:02:06.265 --> 00:02:08.294
And in tree and a half years is nothing.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.513
In that, whatever was possible he said positively,

00:02:12.681 --> 00:02:15.923
 he told about the future,  all that was to happen.

00:02:16.708 --> 00:02:18.768
 He didn't talk much about the Holy Ghost.

00:02:18.887 --> 00:02:22.858
The reason was His Mother was the Holy Ghost at that time

00:02:23.152 --> 00:02:25.100
 and He didn't want to talk about Her

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:27.930
because the attention of the people

00:02:28.144 --> 00:02:30.890
would be on Her and they would have killed Her.

00:02:31.953 --> 00:02:35.463
And then he has got eleven destroying powers.

00:02:35.742 --> 00:02:39.258
 And he would have used those eleven destroying powers

00:02:39.481 --> 00:02:42.311
and everything would have been finished,

00:02:42.446 --> 00:02:44.525
 the whole drama would have been finished.

00:02:44.858 --> 00:02:48.513
So He did not mention much about the Holy Ghost and did not exaplain.

00:02:49.061 --> 00:02:53.224
But logically we must understand that we talk of the Father

00:02:53.495 --> 00:02:56.475
 and of the Son but not of the Mother.

00:02:56.602 --> 00:03:00.002
How can you have a father and a son and no mother?

00:03:00.255 --> 00:03:04.442
 That's an impossibility. So, Holy Ghost is the Primordial Mother.

00:03:04.823 --> 00:03:06.852
In the sanskrit language if you go -

00:03:06.996 --> 00:03:10.093
 because in the Bible you cannot find everything about Christ,

00:03:10.278 --> 00:03:11.603
 it's very little.

00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:15.603
But you have to go back about 1400 years back that in India,

00:03:16.436 --> 00:03:19.601
people have prophesied about Him, how He will be coming.

00:03:19.815 --> 00:03:21.885
 And about the Primordial Mother

00:03:21.996 --> 00:03:25.067
who was called as Adi Shakti  who was the Holy Ghost.

00:03:25.357 --> 00:03:28.615
All description was given  and when Her advent will come

00:03:28.742 --> 00:03:31.224
 what will happen and how to recognize her.

00:03:32.123 --> 00:03:35.850
All this is described very well so many years back,

00:03:35.977 --> 00:03:38.911
even about Christ, quite a lot to described

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.960
 and also we are going to read it out to you,

00:03:42.095 --> 00:03:44.960
 the translation of what is written about Christ

00:03:45.222 --> 00:03:50.745
and then there is a complete description about His origin,

00:03:50.907 --> 00:03:54.295
 how He came on this earth and what was the purpose of His life.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.657
Ask that gentlemen to come inside. Can you ?

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.428
This gentlemen, come inside. You sit comfortably.

00:04:02.282 --> 00:04:04.413
And what was the purpose of His life

00:04:04.565 --> 00:04:08.143
and how He has to establish in this centre here

00:04:08.421 --> 00:04:12.094
and that by establishing there he can suck

00:04:12.261 --> 00:04:16.821
the ego and superego in you and how He takes you away,

00:04:16.996 --> 00:04:21.197
 or He washes off your karmas and your conditionings.

00:04:21.364 --> 00:04:25.409
All that has been described very well in the Devi Mahatmya book

00:04:25.489 --> 00:04:28.480
 out of which we are just going to read a little bit to you

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:29.961
about the adoration.

00:04:30.168 --> 00:04:33.625
So Bible cannot contain Christ, because Christ is Chaitanya,

00:04:33.736 --> 00:04:37.136
 He is Omkara, He is the Logos as we call Him.

00:04:37.359 --> 00:04:41.514
 He is the Power, and you cannot describe Him in one little book,

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:44.895
when He was here only for three and a half years  and

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:48.197
the people who saw him also were his disciples,

00:04:48.324 --> 00:04:50.821
they did not know much about Him.

00:04:50.965 --> 00:04:53.314
 Until he was resurrected they did not believe Him

00:04:53.567 --> 00:04:56.927
 and even after His death, I mean His resurrection,

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.965
Matthew and all these people were quite disturbed and upset

00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:03.165
 because you know they were all persecuted

00:05:03.277 --> 00:05:06.033
and they, somehow or the other, wanted to continue

00:05:06.394 --> 00:05:09.504
 the message of Christ in a very secretive manner.

00:05:10.713 --> 00:05:13.820
So today the time has come for you to know about Him,

00:05:14.019 --> 00:05:17.815
about what He was -  in the Heaven

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:19.881
 and how He came on this Earth.

00:05:20.143 --> 00:05:24.224
 All that we don't have time today but we'll be just telling you

00:05:24.633 --> 00:05:27.738
 about a little passage that is written about him.

00:05:27.905 --> 00:05:30.885
So first, He is the one who is innocence,

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:32.909
 who is an eternal child,

00:05:33.211 --> 00:05:37.714
and He appears first on the first chakra of Muladhara,

00:05:37.897 --> 00:05:39.957
 and there He's called as Shri Ganesh.

00:05:40.092 --> 00:05:42.604
Where the carbon atom was made. Carbon.

00:05:42.859 --> 00:05:46.223
And that is very important to understand that Ganesha

00:05:46.464 --> 00:05:49.456
 is the symbol of innocence

00:05:49.662 --> 00:05:56.697
and Mother Earth is the power of that deity, Ganesha.

00:05:57.062 --> 00:06:01.767
So it was Ganesha, later on incarnated on this Earth  as Christ,

00:06:01.923 --> 00:06:06.301
 and He will be incarnated again as eleven Rudras,

00:06:06.515 --> 00:06:10.028
 means Ekadashas, or we can call him as Nishkalanka deity,

00:06:10.647 --> 00:06:13.683
when He will just sort out things in a sense that

00:06:13.811 --> 00:06:18.029
He will just cut the people out who are not realised,

00:06:18.196 --> 00:06:21.772
 who are no good, and the rest of them

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.363
will ascend in the Kingdom of Heaven,

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:26.360
 this is what is the last Ascent.

00:06:26.788 --> 00:06:29.074
Now, for this ... Please sit down, please.

00:06:29.495 --> 00:06:31.404
 Please be seated, give him a chair ...

00:06:31.523 --> 00:06:33.561
 You have to sit down comfortably. You see,

00:06:33.713 --> 00:06:36.876
It is a thing that makes... happen something within you,

00:06:37.241 --> 00:06:39.831
so you have to be very much restful, that's very important.

00:06:39.902 --> 00:06:43.396
Give him a chair if he cannot sit on the ground.

00:06:43.564 --> 00:06:47.851
Give him a chair, but be comfortable otherwise it won't work out, you see,

00:06:48.012 --> 00:06:50.643
 it is not something that will go into your mind,

00:06:50.724 --> 00:06:52.842
 it's something that will go to your being, so

00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:54.377
you have to be very receptive.

00:06:54.552 --> 00:06:56.618
Another thing I'll tell you, yesterday also

00:06:56.713 --> 00:07:00.614
I saw, and today also, you should not move your neck

00:07:00.725 --> 00:07:03.077
by eating something or chewing something

00:07:03.172 --> 00:07:05.881
because this Vishuddhi chakra gets upset at that time.

00:07:05.961 --> 00:07:08.595
So keep still, unless and until you are still

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.062
 it cannot work out. So please keep still.

00:07:13.125 --> 00:07:15.240
So this is the nourishment of the roots

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.171
of which we are going to work out, which you will feel it,

00:07:18.382 --> 00:07:21.441
very nicely within yourself.
