00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.210
You see,

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:02.049
in India,

00:00:02.099 --> 00:00:04.170
we have like different families

00:00:04.659 --> 00:00:05.260
for music.

00:00:06.219 --> 00:00:10.340
Like kiran guana agrana all kinds of garranas we have.

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:13.359
The specialty of Maharashtra

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:14.739
is [?].

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:17.370
Is the music that they

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:19.579
sing

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:21.370
In the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.950
dramas in the [?]

00:00:23.469 --> 00:00:26.219
you have heard her singing so all the time.

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:28.920
The actor is standing and singing,

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:30.500
actress is standing and singing.

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:33.549
They have to remember by heart everything

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:34.830
and

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:36.599
it's a very fast number,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.369
always a very,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.549
very fast number

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.840
uh it's not easy to sing those songs,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.599
so I requested her to at least sing one song from Nati Sangeet because

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.569
that's the

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:49.150
essence of Maharashtraan music.

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:51.200
After this

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.630
Great

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:55.680
Music programme,

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.330
I don't know what to say in words.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.790
But I must say they are all Sahaja Yogis.

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:04.879
They have come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.290
they have got the realisation.

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:08.680
And all these

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.379
great artists are now coming to Sahaja Yoga so easily.

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:14.550
It's,

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:15.949
they are our family.

00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:32.199
And the

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:33.980
closeness

00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:39.400
we feel for them you can see it in the music even if you don't understand the words.

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:43.199
The way you see they penetrate into your being

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:44.919
because they are Sahaja Yogis.

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:47.180
And the

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.300
also,

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.819
the

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:53.449
Songs they have chosen

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.790
were very,

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.949
very remarkable

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.750
and beautiful.

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:59.660
I really don't know how to

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:01.430
thank they are my children.

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:02.919
I don't know what to say,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.029
but the only thing I say that

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.849
you

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.919
should continue with your music.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.940
And all my blessings,

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.020
not only that,

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.419
but I would do anything to spread this music

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:17.339
all over the world,

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:18.710
and we have now.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.350
And we have now such an

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:34.699
audience.

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:37.240
Such a

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:38.919
musical audience,

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.960
you can see that.

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:42.809
And such a report was established.

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:45.560
Shows that this

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.910
Divine music

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:54.149
will be eternal and eternally spreading all over.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.470
May God bless you all the listeners and also the musicians.

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:59.669
May God bless.
