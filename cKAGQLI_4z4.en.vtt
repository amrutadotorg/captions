AI GENERATED. You see,

1
00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:02.049
in India,

2
00:00:02.099 --> 00:00:04.170
we have like different families

3
00:00:04.659 --> 00:00:05.260
for music.

4
00:00:06.219 --> 00:00:10.340
Like kiran guana agrana all kinds of garranas we have.

5
00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:13.359
The specialty of Maharashtra

6
00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:14.739
is not Tessan.

7
00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:17.370
Is the music that they.

8
00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:19.549
See

9
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:21.319
In the

10
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.950
dramas in the places

11
00:00:23.469 --> 00:00:26.219
you have heard her singing so all the time.

12
00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:28.920
The actor is standing and singing,

13
00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:30.500
actress is standing and singing.

14
00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:33.549
They have to remember by heart everything

15
00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:34.830
and uh

16
00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:36.599
it's a very fast number,

17
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.369
always a very,

18
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.549
very fast number

19
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.840
uh it's not easy to sing those songs,

20
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.599
so I requested her to at least sing one song from Nati Sangeet because

21
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.569
that's the

22
00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:49.150
essence of Maharashtraan music.

23
00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:51.200
After this

24
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.630
Great

25
00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:55.680
Music programme,

26
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.330
I don't know what to say in words.

27
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.790
But I must say they are all surgis.

28
00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:04.879
They have come to suruga,

29
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.290
they have got the realisation.

30
00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:08.680
And all these

31
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.379
great artists are now coming to Sergioga so easily.

32
00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:14.550
It's,

33
00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:15.949
they are our family.

34
00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:32.199
And the

35
00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:33.980
Closeness

36
00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:39.400
we feel for them you can see it in the music even if you don't understand the words.

37
00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:43.199
The way you see they penetrate into your being

38
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:44.919
because they are surgeries.

39
00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:47.180
And the

40
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.269
Also,

41
00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.709
the

42
00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:53.449
Songs they have chosen

43
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.790
were very,

44
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.949
very remarkable

45
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.750
and beautiful.

46
00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:59.660
I really don't know how to

47
00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:01.430
thank they are my children.

48
00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:02.919
I don't know what to say,

49
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.029
but the only thing I say that

50
00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.849
you

51
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.919
should continue with your music.

52
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.940
And all my blessings,

53
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.020
not only that,

54
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.419
but I would do anything to spread this music

55
00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:17.339
all over the world,

56
00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:18.710
and we have now.

57
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.350
And we have now such an

58
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:34.699
audience.

59
00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:37.240
Such a

60
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:38.919
musical audience,

61
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.960

62
00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:42.809
And such a report was established.

63
00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:45.770
Shows that this

64
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.910
Divine music

65
00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:54.149
Will be eternal and eternally spreading all over.

66
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.470
May God bless you all the listeners and also the musicians.

67
00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:59.669
May God bless.
