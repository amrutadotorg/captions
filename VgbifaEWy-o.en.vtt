WEBVTT

06:58.167 --> 07:04.209
I bow to all the sahaja yogis of the world.

07:16.334 --> 07:19.083
It is very heartening

07:19.459 --> 07:25.209
to see so many of you assembled here to do the Guru Puja.

07:37.250 --> 07:47.417
To worship your Guru in person is regarded as the highest blessing.

07:57.999 --> 08:04.584
But in My case it’s a very different combination

08:05.083 --> 08:08.876
that I am your Mother and your Guru.

08:17.334 --> 08:23.792
So you can understand how Shri Ganesha worshipped his Mother.

08:28.959 --> 08:33.209
You all are created in the same image of Shri Ganesha

08:37.417 --> 08:41.417
who worshipped His Mother

08:42.250 --> 08:46.918
and then He became the Adi Guru, the first Guru.

08:52.167 --> 08:57.792
He is the primordial essence of mastery.

09:01.667 --> 09:08.250
Only the Mother can make the child a master.

09:10.125 --> 09:15.542
And the motherhood in any Guru – whether male or female –

09:16.334 --> 09:20.042
can only make the disciple a Guru.

09:28.959 --> 09:33.501
So, first you have to become the prophets

09:33.999 --> 09:37.584
and develop that motherhood within yourself,

09:39.375 --> 09:44.083
then you can make others also prophets.

09:58.542 --> 10:01.209
Now, to become a Guru,

10:03.501 --> 10:08.876
what do we have to do after our realisation?

10:15.083 --> 10:18.584
Guru word means gravity.

10:23.501 --> 10:26.542
Gravity means a person who is grave

10:26.792 --> 10:32.000
who is deep, who is magnetic.

10:40.209 --> 10:42.918
Now as you have learnt in Sahaja Yoga

10:43.125 --> 10:47.417
that realisation takes place in complete effortlessness.

10:56.999 --> 11:02.959
So normally a Guru tries to make his disciples effortless,

11:11.542 --> 11:16.751
which is called as prayatna shaytilya – means ‘relax your efforts‘.

11:25.542 --> 11:28.584
Without doing anything you got

11:29.083 --> 11:32.959
your prayatna shaytilya, otherwise Kundalini would not have risen.

11:43.542 --> 11:48.334
Then the second stage is vichara shaithilya – the thoughtless awareness.

11:56.959 --> 12:00.417
This also you got it without doing anything.

12:05.667 --> 12:10.709
And the third is complete negation of thought, abhava,

12:15.334 --> 12:18.209
and the bliss of peace.

12:22.751 --> 12:25.042
So one has to understand that

12:25.292 --> 12:28.125
you have to pass then, through three stages.

12:33.042 --> 12:35.709
First, when you get your realisation

12:35.999 --> 12:40.999
all these things come spontaneously, for that moment.

12:48.999 --> 12:51.417
When you raise the Kundalini of others,

12:51.626 --> 12:54.584
these things happen to them spontaneously.

12:59.167 --> 13:01.250
You too have that power now

13:01.542 --> 13:05.999
to raise the Kundalini of people and to establish it in them.

13:13.250 --> 13:17.626
But we must understand why it has to be done that way,

13:22.751 --> 13:25.751
why we have to have vichara shaithilya –

13:29.417 --> 13:33.250
because when you project any thought,

13:33.709 --> 13:35.250
it is artificial,

13:41.792 --> 13:43.459
it is not reality.

13:45.334 --> 13:48.375
Thought always stands between you and the reality.

13:53.209 --> 13:59.918
When you put in an effort, you stand against becoming.

14:08.375 --> 14:15.334
For example, if I have to cure you

14:16.292 --> 14:19.834
I just put my hand and finished – no effort,

14:25.334 --> 14:28.334
because I am that.

14:30.209 --> 14:34.999
You get your realisation because I am that.

14:38.250 --> 14:42.959
I don’t put in any effort, I don’t think about it, I am that.

14:49.167 --> 14:52.876
Just looking at someone, it can be done.

14:59.209 --> 15:02.751
Just putting attention to someone, it can be done.

15:07.501 --> 15:11.792
Just with a small desire, it can be done –

15:15.542 --> 15:21.000
because you are that. You can mould it the way you like.

15:28.667 --> 15:31.167
You can get an example from gold.

15:31.751 --> 15:34.000
Now gold is untarnishable

15:34.209 --> 15:37.083
It does not have to think it is untarnishable,

15:37.334 --> 15:41.250
it does not have to put in an effort it is untarnishable – it is.

15:54.083 --> 16:00.959
So to be, to be, you don’t have to put in any effort.

16:01.209 --> 16:05.042
If you have to put in an effort, that means you are not yet that.

16:14.834 --> 16:19.626
If you look at the sun – it shines.

16:19.876 --> 16:24.918
It doesn’t have to put in effort to shine – it shines.

16:33.209 --> 16:36.918
So to be that, if you have to put in an effort,

16:37.125 --> 16:40.918
that means you are not that, you are trying, you are artificial.

16:50.918 --> 16:55.667
The flowers are beautiful so they don’t have to beautify themselves.

17:03.501 --> 17:06.417
And this is what one has to understand – that innately

17:06.626 --> 17:11.083
if you are that,  if you have already become,

17:11.334 --> 17:14.000
then what is the need to put in any more effort?

17:25.792 --> 17:28.959
But when we say these things, you see,

17:29.167 --> 17:31.751
then people think you have to be lethargic,

17:41.834 --> 17:43.709
that you need not do anything,

17:46.417 --> 17:49.250
you become a Guru without doing anything.

17:52.501 --> 17:56.709
That’s why, at the very outset, I said it goes in stages.

18:03.083 --> 18:06.501
So the first stage is of Shri Ganesha –

18:09.959 --> 18:13.999
how He surrenders to the Shakti, to the Mother –

18:18.999 --> 18:21.834
that is the beginning. If one cannot surrender…

18:22.000 --> 18:24.417
That doesn’t mean you don’t do anything,

18:24.626 --> 18:27.584
but surrendering means the worship,

18:40.417 --> 18:42.792
the respect of the higher,

18:46.999 --> 18:49.876
the obedience to the higher.

18:53.626 --> 18:55.751
Not to argue it out,

18:58.959 --> 19:03.125
not to react, acceptance,

19:05.417 --> 19:10.876
absorption. Like a child absorbs the milk of the mother

19:15.667 --> 19:19.125
without questioning, without reasoning.

19:20.375 --> 19:23.959
That’s why Christ has said, “You have to become like children”.

19:27.501 --> 19:31.792
But if you are questioning, then you are no more a child.

19:33.792 --> 19:35.542
So first is the state,

19:35.751 --> 19:39.083
which you have to develop, is the child-like state.

19:42.667 --> 19:47.709
But child, which is a realised child, which has to have a gravity.

19:51.959 --> 19:58.292
If you can develop childhood first,

19:58.584 --> 20:01.876
then everything takes proper course,

20:12.167 --> 20:14.999
because maturity cannot take place unless

20:15.167 --> 20:17.876
and until you start from the very beginning,

20:25.667 --> 20:29.584
and gravity means maturity not frivolousness.

20:35.501 --> 20:37.959
So now the quality of Ganesha, as you know,

20:38.167 --> 20:41.459
is that He has viveka, means He has discretion.

20:47.417 --> 20:50.876
He ‘has’ means He is discretion.

20:54.083 --> 20:57.876
So try to develop your discretion power

21:03.083 --> 21:11.584
so that Shri Ganesha gives you the wisdom – subuddhi – wisdom.

21:16.375 --> 21:21.083
And this is why you have to have a dependence on Shri Ganesha.

21:25.999 --> 21:31.959
So at this point you have to make a negation of efforts.

21:35.876 --> 21:42.334
Like, whatever are efforts anti-Ganesha,

21:42.667 --> 21:46.999
or anti-innocence must be negated.

21:54.542 --> 22:02.375
So the negation of effort

22:02.792 --> 22:08.792
is to be achieved by negating whatever is the effort –

22:14.292 --> 22:17.999
means the effort of negation.

22:22.459 --> 22:25.375
So in the beginning you will not be effortless,

22:33.375 --> 22:36.834
you will have to put in effort for that.

22:42.083 --> 22:45.918
Like Christ has said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”.

22:56.709 --> 22:59.876
So how do you make your eyes innocent?

23:03.209 --> 23:10.000
In Sahaja Yoga we have a method by which we try to distract our eyes

23:10.375 --> 23:16.501
from effort that makes it adulterous.

23:28.125 --> 23:30.834
Like, we try to put our attention, our eyes,

23:31.000 --> 23:34.792
on the Mother Earth, on the grass, on the trees.

23:40.542 --> 23:46.626
So the avoidance, the avoiding of the effort itself is effort.

23:55.167 --> 23:58.000
So those people who have come now,

23:59.459 --> 24:03.000
recently, have to understand also that they have to put in

24:03.209 --> 24:06.626
all kinds of efforts to stop the efforts.

24:19.250 --> 24:23.375
For example, some people are used to very comfortable life,

24:23.542 --> 24:26.083
they may talk of all kinds of renunciation,

24:26.292 --> 24:29.334
when it comes to comfort, they want to have comfort.

24:37.042 --> 24:42.501
Such people should try to get out of the habit of comfort –

24:42.709 --> 24:45.918
Sleep on the ground, sleep on the Mother Earth.

25:06.334 --> 25:08.417
Some people have an attention

25:08.626 --> 25:10.626
which is all the time looking this side, that side –

25:10.792 --> 25:13.209
cannot see to one point – so fix your attention.

25:26.918 --> 25:31.918
So gradually, you will find, you’ll discipline yourself.

25:38.334 --> 25:41.375
So the effort that you put in

25:41.792 --> 25:46.083
is very important in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga.

25:54.584 --> 25:56.667
Another thing is very common, in the West,

25:56.959 --> 25:59.834
is the harsh tongue, the sarcasm

26:00.250 --> 26:05.834
and hurting others – is a very subtle way of violence.

26:16.417 --> 26:20.709
Or if they are really blunt

26:20.959 --> 26:25.709
they can start with ego expressions also “I, I, I…”

26:33.292 --> 26:34.876
Such people should stop talking

26:35.042 --> 26:38.334
completely, make an effort to stop – just don’t talk.

26:44.999 --> 26:46.709
Now watch your mind – is it

26:46.959 --> 26:50.709
is it trying to talk something sarcastic, nonsensical?

27:01.375 --> 27:04.375
So, this watching also requires effort.

27:12.250 --> 27:15.292
So, to sprout the seed is easy,

27:15.542 --> 27:20.375
but then one has to put in the effort to look after the little plant.

27:34.792 --> 27:38.667
And when it matures, then it’s on its own.

27:45.584 --> 27:50.834
So the, first the effort should be made to protect yourself

27:51.042 --> 27:54.334
against the mind which you have built in,

27:54.584 --> 27:56.459
through your ego or superego,

27:56.626 --> 28:00.918
that goes into the wrong direction of effort.

28:16.751 --> 28:20.792
But sometimes, be very careful, you have to be discreet.

28:28.918 --> 28:35.125
And the best way to be safe on discretion is to keep in the centre –

28:35.292 --> 28:38.709
never go to any extreme of anything.

28:48.250 --> 28:51.459
For example, some people are fond of music, say,

28:52.125 --> 28:55.542
so they’ll go on after the music part of it.

29:00.626 --> 29:03.542
Some people, say, are fond of poetry,

29:03.834 --> 29:06.667
then they’ll go after the poetry only.

29:13.918 --> 29:16.167
There is nothing wrong in those things,

29:18.626 --> 29:20.876
but whatever you achieve in all these things

29:21.000 --> 29:23.209
must be brought back to the collective

29:23.417 --> 29:25.751
and must be enjoyed by everyone,

29:26.000 --> 29:30.083
and you should also enjoy what others have found.

29:45.751 --> 29:51.667
For example, somebody is a very learned man and a dry person.

29:58.751 --> 30:03.959
So he has to make an effort to make himself sweet.

30:08.751 --> 30:14.459
So try to neutralise your extreme nature by coming in the centre,

30:22.876 --> 30:26.959
and the best way to say is, “I like everything.

30:34.999 --> 30:39.000
The way You keep me, I am happy in that state.”

30:46.792 --> 30:51.709
And to suggest yourself that, “I am the peace”

30:53.083 --> 30:56.250
– suggest, autosuggestion,

31:03.584 --> 31:08.751
“I am the satisfaction, I am the dignity.”

31:10.542 --> 31:14.334
Try to impose these artificialities upon yourself

31:23.667 --> 31:26.709
of these virtues and righteousness,

31:32.751 --> 31:37.375
and then ask yourself “If I am dignified how can I do such a thing?”

31:37.751 --> 31:42.083
Ask yourself, you judge yourself with those.

31:54.876 --> 31:57.667
For example, somebody is a miserly person

31:57.959 --> 32:00.083
and he says, “Oh you must be generous” –

32:00.292 --> 32:02.417
then you can call him a hypocrite.

32:08.042 --> 32:13.000
But supposing the miserly, you see, questions himself

32:13.501 --> 32:16.125
then he is not a hypocrite.

32:27.125 --> 32:32.626
So when you put all these artificial, so-called,

32:32.999 --> 32:38.792
values upon yourself – sort of a goal –

32:39.042 --> 32:43.459
and then try to achieve that goal through your own effort,

32:43.834 --> 32:45.999
then you become that.

33:10.250 --> 33:15.751
So automatically you criticise yourself and you don’t criticise others

33:21.459 --> 33:25.667
and you know what’s wrong with you.

33:28.999 --> 33:32.000
Because, what’s the use of knowing what’s wrong with others?

33:36.751 --> 33:39.918
It is like England trying to improve the conditions in India,

33:40.125 --> 33:43.501
and India trying to improve the conditions in England.

33:47.459 --> 33:51.125
But in this also human brain has an escape.

33:55.125 --> 33:58.417
When they want to criticise themselves, they find a pouch

33:58.667 --> 34:02.542
called the left Vishuddhi and become settled there.

34:13.292 --> 34:16.375
The more cunning you are, the more clever you are,

34:16.626 --> 34:18.751
the worse is the left Vishuddhi.

34:24.250 --> 34:28.209
Then you put everything there, settled down nicely to stagnate,

34:28.584 --> 34:30.918
to get all kinds of filth in it

34:31.125 --> 34:34.417
and to be settled with yourself nicely.

34:46.792 --> 34:48.792
It’s like any lousy housewife –

34:49.083 --> 34:50.542
she takes all the dirt of the house

34:50.751 --> 34:53.584
and all that and piles up into a room, locks it up,

34:53.918 --> 34:56.250
and thinks,  oh she has been very efficient.

35:08.250 --> 35:11.292
You have to face it and you have to correct it and see to it!

35:16.751 --> 35:19.709
And that’s how you become powerful.

35:21.709 --> 35:24.042
Because if your machinery is out of gear,

35:24.292 --> 35:27.417
what’s the use of improving somebody else’s machinery?

35:32.501 --> 35:34.501
And when your machinery is out of gear,

35:34.751 --> 35:36.209
you put it in a lock and key,

35:36.459 --> 35:38.834
and lock it up and say, “Now it’s alright.”

35:46.626 --> 35:49.834
Or you blame somebody because of this, because of that –

35:50.000 --> 35:52.751
something else other than you.

36:01.000 --> 36:05.250
Thank God to Sahaja Yoga today that you all have got realisation,

36:05.459 --> 36:08.501
so I don’t have to do all that cleaning, you can do yourself.

36:15.918 --> 36:20.459
So, in short, you become your own Guru to begin with.

36:23.876 --> 36:26.834
You try to tell yourself, separate yourself from yourself

36:27.042 --> 36:31.751
and say, “Hello Sir, how are you now, come along.”

36:41.792 --> 36:44.459
But in Sahaja Yoga, you see, people

36:45.375 --> 36:50.000
suddenly assume, you see, a big sort of a ego nonsense,

36:50.250 --> 36:51.959
and they think they are big gurus,

36:52.167 --> 36:55.000
you see, big, great people, avadhutas, you see, like that.

37:05.042 --> 37:07.042
And if you ask them,

37:07.209 --> 37:09.834
they say, “Mother, Mother I loved You very much.”

37:19.459 --> 37:21.959
So they think if they love Me, then it is My duty

37:22.167 --> 37:24.626
that I should really keep you clean.

37:33.250 --> 37:36.709
That’s not the attitude of a guru.

37:39.999 --> 37:44.834
What guru does, is to purify himself and others

37:45.042 --> 37:49.417
and give those flowers to the Deity.

37:55.417 --> 37:59.584
Till you all become gurus, I am your Guru,

37:59.999 --> 38:02.375
but once you become the guru

38:02.918 --> 38:05.542
then I become your Deity.

38:10.083 --> 38:17.125
Till they are not yet gurus, I am their Guru.

38:17.834 --> 38:19.542
Till they reach that state.

38:19.834 --> 38:24.167
Once they become the guru, then I am their Deity.

38:34.918 --> 38:39.834
Like all the Gurus, we can say Mohammad sahib –

38:40.209 --> 38:43.375
He talked of “Allah Hu Akbar.”

38:47.501 --> 38:50.125
He talked of the Holy Ghost,

38:51.209 --> 38:54.501
He talked of the resurrection,

38:54.876 --> 38:57.667
because He was a Guru.

38:57.999 --> 39:02.417
And whatever He had to say, He said it with full confidence

39:02.667 --> 39:05.250
pointing out towards the point where

39:05.542 --> 39:09.709
He looks, or where He gets His guidance from.

39:19.000 --> 39:26.167
Like Moses, like Christ also put His two fingers denoting His Father

39:29.876 --> 39:33.709
So till you become your own guru,

39:34.000 --> 39:38.709
you have to put in effort in the beginning.

39:46.417 --> 39:49.959
Then gradually you can achieve it effortlessly.

39:55.918 --> 40:00.000
Effortlessness is not to be certified,

40:02.999 --> 40:05.626
but you can verify it.

40:07.167 --> 40:10.250
A person who is discrete –

40:10.667 --> 40:14.167
in his presence others become discrete.

40:20.584 --> 40:26.792
A person who is honest – others in his presence become honest.

40:31.209 --> 40:35.834
It is said in Sanskrit language, ‘Yatha raja tatha praja’ –

40:36.083 --> 40:39.459
‘As the king is that’s how the subjects are’.

40:45.083 --> 40:49.250
When you are the guru, you are the example.

40:52.250 --> 40:54.999
You have to be the example.

40:55.999 --> 40:59.250
Now I have seen people who are gurus, who think,

40:59.459 --> 41:02.250
call themselves gurus, in different varieties and different

41:02.501 --> 41:04.999
types of life: like professors, teachers,

41:05.167 --> 41:07.417
you can call them, not spiritual gurus.

41:19.334 --> 41:21.792
They too, when they try

41:22.292 --> 41:25.417
to follow a mundane type of life –

41:25.667 --> 41:27.999
not of something exceptional –

41:28.334 --> 41:32.584
then their disciples lose faith in them.

41:47.125 --> 41:50.334
Even political leaders, when they…

41:50.584 --> 41:54.125
supposing a political leader is licentious, he has weaknesses,

41:54.709 --> 42:03.250
then the people who try to follow him have no respect.

42:14.501 --> 42:17.250
So they too have to have a personal character,

42:17.459 --> 42:20.292
a personal value system.

42:29.459 --> 42:32.834
So what about the spiritual gurus then?

42:37.000 --> 42:40.125
They have to be excellent people.

42:42.167 --> 42:48.709
There should be no two types of life, one outside, one inside.

42:55.250 --> 42:59.751
When the outside and inside becomes one, then it is effortless

43:09.209 --> 43:11.584
and that is what one has to do –

43:11.834 --> 43:18.125
the inside and the outside, one has to work it out from inside.

43:23.709 --> 43:27.375
For that you cannot bring the outside inside,

43:27.667 --> 43:31.250
but inside has to go outside.

43:34.876 --> 43:38.751
So this is the beginning of antar yoga, the inner yoga.

43:42.959 --> 43:47.209
At the second stage you have to become thoughtless.

43:50.459 --> 43:53.999
This is very important in the West

43:54.709 --> 43:58.417
because they live in thoughts – they do not have other problems

43:58.751 --> 44:00.918
of a gross nature.

44:09.292 --> 44:10.667
For example,

44:10.834 --> 44:17.167
they are brought up in such a way that they are frightened of law.

44:24.792 --> 44:28.042
They are brought up this way – they’ll keep all their carpets clean,

44:28.250 --> 44:29.792
everything clean, you see,

44:29.999 --> 44:33.042
very particular about keeping every place clean.

44:42.125 --> 44:46.542
All the gross things they keep clean,

44:56.334 --> 45:05.250
and then when they try to adjust themselves, they adjust within.

45:11.125 --> 45:13.584
Outwardly they are gentlemanly,

45:17.000 --> 45:22.626
but inside, in their thought, they are not clean.

45:24.709 --> 45:28.000
In their behaviour they are not clean, their eyes are not clean,

45:31.626 --> 45:33.375
it’s poison inside.

45:34.709 --> 45:37.292
And they like that poison to be taken out –

45:37.417 --> 45:40.334
sometimes it comes out as sarcasm,

45:44.501 --> 45:49.501
it comes out as their sinister acts of aggression on other countries.

45:56.292 --> 45:59.626
They may plan out the complete destruction of the world

46:04.334 --> 46:08.417
and they don’t think there’s anything wrong in it

46:10.834 --> 46:13.626
because it is ‘an ideology’ for which, is a thought

46:13.876 --> 46:15.167
they are fighting for.

46:22.667 --> 46:25.709
As long as there is an ideology, there’s a thought,

46:25.959 --> 46:29.918
there’s some sort of a sublime talk, then they can do what they like.

46:41.167 --> 46:44.459
This filth is very sophisticated.

46:48.459 --> 46:51.417
Like the people who don’t take their baths can use some

46:51.667 --> 46:55.834
artificial things to get a fragrance.

46:59.792 --> 47:02.083
Inside has to be clean

47:03.959 --> 47:08.999
and that’s why first the efforts are to be made to have good thoughts.

47:14.918 --> 47:17.250
Watch your mind –

47:19.125 --> 47:21.999
how does it think about others?

47:24.083 --> 47:28.876
I would say, racialism is one of the diseases of the same thing.

47:34.918 --> 47:38.334
I have seen people who are very well placed,

47:38.542 --> 47:41.167
sophisticated, wear immaculate dresses:

47:41.459 --> 47:48.042
when it comes to a person from a developing country,  or from say,

47:48.292 --> 47:54.250
another colour complexion, they come out with a remark,

47:54.626 --> 48:00.167
even if they are Sahaja Yogis I have seen they do it.

48:17.667 --> 48:21.417
I am saying this for the Sahaja Yogis and not for others.

48:24.417 --> 48:31.167
That suddenly that dead stuff, which we call as dead, becomes alive.

48:39.167 --> 48:42.459
So the mind is dirty,

48:43.792 --> 48:50.667
full of lust, greed, and anger, jealousy –

48:54.125 --> 48:59.167
and that’s why we have to be very, very careful.
Those people who have become sophisticated

48:59.459 --> 49:02.834
their weaknesses have also become sophisticated,

49:09.125 --> 49:12.542
and that’s why jealousy is a common disease.

49:15.792 --> 49:18.501
Like the other day I asked someone,

49:18.709 --> 49:21.542
“Why the father is angry with the son,

49:28.626 --> 49:31.626
and with his own brother?”

49:31.999 --> 49:34.000
So the answer was, “Because

49:34.334 --> 49:38.584
the brother is looking after the son in London.”

50:00.375 --> 50:03.417
Normally any person should be thankful

50:03.709 --> 50:08.125
that: somebody is looking after my son in my absence.

50:13.334 --> 50:16.042
But the fellow is jealous

50:16.334 --> 50:19.250
because of possessiveness

50:19.709 --> 50:22.792
and the possessiveness comes out of insecurity,

50:25.751 --> 50:28.667
and insecurity comes within us

50:28.999 --> 50:32.167
because we make others insecured.

50:39.918 --> 50:43.709
There are many reasons for insecurity,  but one of them is

50:43.876 --> 50:48.000
because we are ugly and we see that ugliness in others.

51:00.792 --> 51:04.083
Now this inside filth has to be taken out

51:04.334 --> 51:07.709
with greater effort than the outside filth,

51:15.709 --> 51:18.918
and that inside filth

51:19.334 --> 51:22.584
you can watch and see within yourself.

51:32.999 --> 51:36.626
Some people try to dominate others, to tell them things –

51:36.876 --> 51:39.584
just for the bossiness of it.

51:51.584 --> 51:56.542
Now watch out – first of all, have you bossed yourself enough?

52:02.000 --> 52:05.209
Have you mastered yourself enough?

52:07.459 --> 52:12.459
Are you master of your own or you are still lacking in that?

52:20.459 --> 52:23.667
Those who have not mastered themselves want to have others,

52:23.959 --> 52:26.501
to master them.

52:34.042 --> 52:39.209
But the one who is the master of oneself, need not master anyone.

52:42.083 --> 52:45.125
He becomes the master.

52:45.834 --> 52:49.042
He doesn’t have to put in any effort, he masters.

52:53.834 --> 52:56.999
And there are so many tricks by which he can master,

53:02.083 --> 53:06.334
so many things by which he can correct.

53:11.584 --> 53:18.751
He may not say, he may not do anything, but just he manages.

53:24.167 --> 53:29.667
Everyone learns a lesson without his doing anything about it.

53:38.209 --> 53:42.792
But they know that somebody is a master of masters.

53:48.083 --> 53:50.626
Maybe, such a person will be very unassuming

53:50.876 --> 53:53.375
simple, innocent looking,

54:03.709 --> 54:08.834
but that’s Mahamaya, that’s the illusion.

54:10.083 --> 54:16.876
So, the person who is that power doesn’t want to show it outside,

54:25.792 --> 54:33.751
on the contrary, it shows in such a way that people know it.

54:42.667 --> 54:46.292
I mean, the way things happen in life,

54:46.584 --> 54:51.125
we start understanding that we don’t have to put up any show –

55:00.083 --> 55:04.209
someone knows everything.

55:06.876 --> 55:11.918
When we have someone like that, try to follow.

55:18.417 --> 55:24.792
So, in the third stage the effort should be to follow your Guru

55:32.709 --> 55:35.501
who is a Sat Guru.

55:39.292 --> 55:45.918
Now that one becomes the one…a pattern, which you have to follow.

55:50.042 --> 55:54.167
But in this also Sahaja Yogis can be very superficial.

55:59.667 --> 56:03.584
One of the Sahaja Yogis used to wear a shawl in a particular way.

56:03.918 --> 56:06.292
So, I sent him some other sahaja yogis that

56:06.584 --> 56:10.000
he will try to help them, he can be their guru;

56:10.792 --> 56:15.167
they all started wearing shawls the same way.

56:35.626 --> 56:40.375
It’s not the outside; you have to follow the inside.

56:42.999 --> 56:50.999
So when you become the guru, become the guru, you become.

56:54.167 --> 57:00.709
It’s such a short method – just to become.

57:02.792 --> 57:04.918
Now if you face yourself, you’ll know

57:05.083 --> 57:08.334
that there are still some steps you have to cross to become.

57:13.959 --> 57:16.167
Even now when I am lecturing to you,

57:16.417 --> 57:19.751
you are thinking of others – “Oh, Mother is talking about him” –

57:20.000 --> 57:21.959
not about yourself.

57:32.792 --> 57:35.876
That is how one has to take it inside, the absorption

57:36.167 --> 57:39.792
from your Guru, that you have to see yourself.

57:48.292 --> 57:51.999
Now, that is very important

57:52.209 --> 57:58.000
if we have to become the prophets who will make others prophets.

58:06.334 --> 58:12.751
Now, the higher stage is that your Guru becomes a Deity.

58:13.667 --> 58:17.709
When you say “Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devo Maheshwara“.

58:17.999 --> 58:20.834
They go up to that point but nobody says “Guru is Devi”.

58:21.125 --> 58:25.709
You can have a higher stage, than Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha.

58:41.375 --> 58:46.918
Because the Guru state is where you have the innocence of all these

58:47.167 --> 58:51.918
Brahma and Mahesha and Vishnu –

59:01.667 --> 59:03.918
their power of innocence.

59:05.250 --> 59:09.292
But then ultimately they say, “Guru Sakshat Parabrahma”.

59:15.834 --> 59:19.876
And Parabrahma is the power of the Mother

59:21.209 --> 59:23.167
– but how?

59:25.918 --> 59:29.709
Not only by becoming but now,

59:30.167 --> 59:33.709
becoming the reflector of your Deity,

59:42.375 --> 59:49.918
to develop yourself into the reflector from guru to that state.

01:00:03.375 --> 01:00:07.876
At that state you start controlling all the elements.

01:00:13.876 --> 01:00:19.834
That’s why all these incarnations of Adi Guru

01:00:20.167 --> 01:00:23.250
had control over elements.

01:00:28.459 --> 01:00:34.834
Brahmadeva is absolutely manifested through them.

01:00:38.834 --> 01:00:44.584
So out of Ganesha, which is the Adi Guru,

01:00:45.417 --> 01:00:48.000
He is born,

01:00:48.292 --> 01:00:53.459
or He is manifested through these three – Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha –

01:01:04.834 --> 01:01:12.501
and then He comes out as Brahmadeva with four heads,

01:01:19.834 --> 01:01:25.918
three of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, and the fourth of Shri Ganesh.

01:01:35.125 --> 01:01:39.501
So Brahmadeva becomes the symbol of Guru,

01:01:43.459 --> 01:01:49.209
and as you know Ganesha is chatvari, is four –all the time.

01:01:49.501 --> 01:01:53.834
He becomes these four – in expression, in manifestation.

01:02:01.292 --> 01:02:05.250
And as you become Brahmadeva, at that stage

01:02:05.542 --> 01:02:08.417
you control all the elements.

01:02:17.918 --> 01:02:22.167
So, today I have tried to explain to you the different

01:02:22.459 --> 01:02:29.375
stages of gurupada – the state of guru.

01:02:36.375 --> 01:02:43.042
And one should understand whatever we are today,

01:02:44.375 --> 01:02:49.626
we are extremely blessed and fortunate people

01:02:58.292 --> 01:03:03.626
that, in this short time, you started from a scratch

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:10.125
in the mud and you have become the lotuses.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.626
The lotus will invite many insects

01:03:23.375 --> 01:03:27.459
and will convert them into lotuses.

01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:33.417
madhukar they call it, madhukar,

01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:37.918
the ones who are selecting the madhu, the nectar,

01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:40.584
the… what do you call? – the honey.

01:03:55.834 --> 01:04:00.584
When they get the nectar, they become themselves the lotuses.

01:04:09.918 --> 01:04:17.626
The whole dirty, filthy pond is covered with those lotus flowers.

01:04:26.959 --> 01:04:30.834
And one lotus, who is the Guru, grows higher,

01:04:33.959 --> 01:04:41.334
and then is given to the Goddess on which She resides.

01:04:49.751 --> 01:04:54.792
She resides in the heart on the platform,

01:04:55.083 --> 01:04:58.292
beautiful platform that this lotus has created.

01:05:03.751 --> 01:05:08.918
But to bear Her on your heart, you have to have a heart.

01:05:15.250 --> 01:05:18.999
There are so many qualities of a Guru, which I have told you.

01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:25.459
All the best qualities, the twelve qualities of all the sides

01:05:25.918 --> 01:05:29.375
should be completely manifested in a Guru,

01:05:36.375 --> 01:05:40.334
and the owner of those qualities is Shiva.

01:05:44.375 --> 01:05:46.959
So that is how the essence of Shiva,

01:05:47.167 --> 01:05:50.250
out of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, the Mahesha’s qualities,

01:05:50.501 --> 01:05:52.250
should shine through you.

01:06:02.334 --> 01:06:04.125
The Vishnu’s qualities of Dharma –

01:06:04.334 --> 01:06:08.167
first you have to make an effort to be dharmic, to be balanced.

01:06:16.751 --> 01:06:20.083
Then you ascend.

01:06:21.999 --> 01:06:25.918
Then you become one with the Viraata

01:06:28.334 --> 01:06:32.959
and then you can give Dharma to others.

01:06:37.792 --> 01:06:41.292
So one has to know that stage-by-stage it happens to you

01:06:41.542 --> 01:06:44.042
and you do not become a hypocrite.

01:06:51.125 --> 01:06:53.959
But you become real

01:06:56.584 --> 01:07:02.042
and the reality is shown by its own being.

01:07:05.167 --> 01:07:07.709
That is how you become.

01:07:08.626 --> 01:07:13.250
So understand the reality within yourself, face it, solve it.

01:07:13.584 --> 01:07:16.125
But mostly, I have seen, when I tell anybody,

01:07:16.292 --> 01:07:17.709
“No, Mother I am not like that.

01:07:17.959 --> 01:07:21.167
No Mother, I didn’t say like that, that is not true!”

01:07:35.626 --> 01:07:38.250
Some such people would like to sit in front

01:07:38.501 --> 01:07:40.751
or sort of try to show off or anything,

01:07:40.959 --> 01:07:41.999
but that is not important.

01:07:42.125 --> 01:07:44.417
What is important is how much you know yourself,

01:07:44.584 --> 01:07:46.417
it is Self-realisation.

01:07:58.042 --> 01:08:02.542
Once you develop that, then you know the others in the real way

01:08:06.918 --> 01:08:08.667
and not artificially,

01:08:09.751 --> 01:08:12.999
and then the enjoyment is complete.

01:08:15.459 --> 01:08:20.876
Like a bee will never go to an artificial flower.

01:08:24.334 --> 01:08:27.792
But human beings have to become the bee.

01:08:32.417 --> 01:08:40.999
The Guru does not need to say that he’s the Guru.

01:08:44.167 --> 01:08:47.792
Today I bless you.

01:08:53.209 --> 01:08:57.999
I have completed the twelve years of Guru’s

01:09:00.042 --> 01:09:04.792
and you should really assume the Shiva’s powers within yourself

01:09:19.918 --> 01:09:27.417
I, that is My body, My mind, My heart,

01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:35.959
everything, has spared no efforts

01:09:37.792 --> 01:09:45.083
to completely indulge into this cleansing, into this making,

01:09:45.501 --> 01:09:48.834
into this becoming of you people.

01:09:57.792 --> 01:10:05.709
I request you now that please do not waste My efforts.

01:10:09.918 --> 01:10:13.792
Look at yourself, help yourself

01:10:15.584 --> 01:10:21.584
and try to rise higher and higher to become your Self.

01:10:25.834 --> 01:10:29.626
When you become your Self, then you become the Guru.

01:10:33.250 --> 01:10:35.125
And once you become the Guru,

01:10:35.334 --> 01:10:40.000
you become Brahmadeva , Mahesha and Vishnu.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:52.417
So first you are made in the pattern of Ganesha,

01:10:53.209 --> 01:10:56.542
then Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha.

01:11:01.959 --> 01:11:06.626
But very much depends on your readiness to do it

01:11:10.709 --> 01:11:17.876
and, most of all, your honesty and sincerity.

01:11:19.083 --> 01:11:22.876
I hope Shri Ganesha will give you the wisdom

01:11:26.334 --> 01:11:29.459
to understand.

01:11:29.999 --> 01:11:35.334
The Shakti will give you shakti to work hard,

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:44.375
and Shiva will give you joy, Sadashiva will give you the joy

01:11:45.167 --> 01:11:50.042
so that you proceed in your establishment.

01:11:58.542 --> 01:12:02.042
May God bless you.
