00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.227
[HINDI - We don't even know as to
what we are searching.]

00:00:13.618 --> 00:00:25.488
[HINDI - Some people think that, if they
get power, they'll be very happy,]

00:00:26.506 --> 00:00:35.496
[HINDI - some think that, if they get too
much money, they'll be very pleased]

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:47.949
[HINDI - and some people also think that, if they
become very powerful, they can overpower others]

00:00:51.986 --> 00:00:59.216
[HINDI - but in this seeking you are
seeking something else.]

00:01:00.177 --> 00:01:08.157
[HINDI - But if this seeking of yours is right
or good, still, even after attaining all this,]

00:01:08.157 --> 00:01:14.828
[HINDI - you are not happy, you have no
satisfaction even when you have got all this.]

00:01:21.384 --> 00:01:27.024
[HINDI - Then, what is the inherent
seeking you have?]

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:39.540
[HINDI - It should not be difficult for us to
understand this because we are Indians living
in India.]

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.620
[HINDI - We have been hearing day and night
since our childhood that beyond this world,]

00:01:47.171 --> 00:01:57.551
[HINDI - beyond this illusion, is the joy of the
Spirit. We have to receive that joy of the Spirit.]

00:02:00.243 --> 00:02:06.973
[HINDI - And this seeking in this
Kaliyuga, I'm surprised,]

00:02:07.323 --> 00:02:16.434
[HINDI - is working out even more in
foreign countries as compared to India]

00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:28.181
[HINDI - and there's exportation of many
people from our country, who take people]

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:40.599
[HINDI - to wrong paths and earn money. And
when we see those people, who believe in God]

00:02:41.105 --> 00:02:47.785
[HINDI - worship Him day and night, go to temples
all the time and are doing all charitable work]

00:02:48.562 --> 00:02:58.162
[HINDI - but they are not good humans,
there's no humanity in them, seeing this]

00:02:58.162 --> 00:03:03.525
[HINDI - we become remorseful and
we start thinking]

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:11.175
[HINDI - what should we understand
from this pensiveness?]

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:20.960
[HINDI - Is this a disappointment or
should we search in something else?]

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:36.909
[HINDI - In the end when this search is one
with the Spirit(Atma) then we come to know]

00:03:37.403 --> 00:03:42.983
[HINDI - that we have to receive that joy,
which is known by various names like]

00:03:42.983 --> 00:03:50.519
[HINDI - Atmaanand, Paramanand
and Niraanand.]

00:03:52.772 --> 00:03:59.222
[HINDI - Like mad, some people, jump and dance
and think that they have received the joy.]

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:12.070
[HINDI - Some people in disillusion think that if 
they have taken drugs they have got great joy]

00:04:12.864 --> 00:04:22.684
[HINDI - . But this pleasure is so momentous this
they know and how harmful it is, this also they know.]

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.350
Today, I'm talking to you about the
excitement people are seeking.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:51.150
Some sort of a sensational feeling. It seems
that our sensitivity has dulled so much

00:04:52.106 --> 00:05:04.836
that we need some sort of a nerve rocking
music or some sort of a sensational atmosphere

00:05:06.773 --> 00:05:19.893
that puts you into another kind of 
personality where you become like a beast.

00:05:22.164 --> 00:05:26.774
You start jumping, you start shouting,
you start screaming -

00:05:27.655 --> 00:05:35.195
is a very common sight, in the West, when you
go there that people indulge into such things.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:44.207
Even very old people try to compete with
young people. They are so stupid sometimes.

00:05:45.597 --> 00:05:59.719
Like once I saw a documentary made in Los
Angeles, where some actors and actresses

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:06.584
who were all above 90 years, were coming
for a shake dance. As it is, when they're

00:06:06.584 --> 00:06:11.677
getting out of their cars, they were shaking
as it is, there was no need to have a dance.

00:06:12.605 --> 00:06:17.045
There was already a dance going on. They
were carrying their sticks and shaking.

00:06:17.742 --> 00:06:27.782
And all these stupid thing are now also
trickling into our country very softly.

00:06:30.998 --> 00:06:38.068
Please remember, these are symptoms
of our destruction.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:48.480
Sitting down here we do not understand
what is the West and what is the East.

00:06:51.145 --> 00:07:00.305
For example, if you are going to New York,
you can't even wear your wedding ring.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:12.760
You don't know somebody may cut your finger
just for the wedding ring. Drug addiction is not the

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:21.147
only problem. There are many other problems,
which we have no idea and we cannot

00:07:21.147 --> 00:07:30.016
comprehend, what stupid things people are
doing in their frantic search for enjoyment.

00:07:33.271 --> 00:07:40.021
I do not blame them because they did
not have this heritage that we have,

00:07:40.379 --> 00:07:46.419
these great saints that we have had, the
great kings we have had in this country

00:07:51.232 --> 00:08:06.592
but we have nothing to learn from them. In
that frenzy, in that mad world, what you find

00:08:07.806 --> 00:08:15.306
that so many of them are trying to break
that cocoon and trying to find out the reality

00:08:16.202 --> 00:08:30.802
because it is too much oppressive, it is too much
for them to bear any more for human consumption

00:08:32.284 --> 00:08:41.034
and that's why their seeking is very deep.
Even the hippies that you know of, are really,

00:08:41.034 --> 00:08:49.249
actually, they were real seekers. Of course,
so many are lost but they were real seekers,

00:08:49.627 --> 00:08:56.297
seekers of Truth, of that joy, of that
eternal life which was promised to them.

00:08:58.294 --> 00:09:04.344
But as luck could have it, in this lifetime
they couldn't get it, many a times.

00:09:07.295 --> 00:09:21.646
But for us, we, we are ancient people. If in
Germany anybody sees the Swastika, he gets a fright.

00:09:22.856 --> 00:09:29.392
He doesn't know this is the symbol, in our
country, of auspiciousness and holiness,

00:09:29.649 --> 00:09:38.449
for thousands of years. Of course, the complete
Swastika is very different from the one that

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:47.220
Hitler chose. And when he used stencils
in the right way, it was alright but

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.740
when he started using the other way
round, is disgusting sight.

00:09:54.166 --> 00:10:02.416
All these symbols that we are using,
are absolutely existing within us.

00:10:05.184 --> 00:10:18.584
We had once two very great scientists,
who asked Me about the symbol of 'Aum'.

00:10:21.335 --> 00:10:32.665
I said that, "If you can make the model of the
Carbon atom," because the first chakra of Mooladhara

00:10:36.868 --> 00:10:54.818
the quality is that of Carbon because the Carbon is
the element which is used to create that chakra.

00:10:56.355 --> 00:11:04.165
And I said that, "You take the photograph
of that atom." I said, "One from the left

00:11:04.165 --> 00:11:08.809
to the right and then from right to the
left and one from down upward."

00:11:10.181 --> 00:11:15.531
And when they took the photograph,
on the right side what do they see -

00:11:15.531 --> 00:11:24.960
from the left when they took, the complete
'Aum' is there and they took the another one

00:11:25.033 --> 00:11:36.223
from the right to the left, what do they see,
is Swastika. And when they took it from below

00:11:36.922 --> 00:11:50.332
it was the cross. It exists within us as
Carbon atom. As scientists, you know

00:11:50.332 --> 00:12:01.173
we have to have Carbon to have Organic
Chemistry. Without Organic Chemistry

00:12:02.463 --> 00:12:10.325
life cannot be made but to that is added Nitrogen
and that's how amino acids have formed.

00:12:12.293 --> 00:12:18.553
That is how the evolution has taken place
through these different centers within us, which

00:12:18.553 --> 00:12:31.184
are just like milestones built on our central
path or we can call it, in Sushumna Naadi.

00:12:33.408 --> 00:12:41.638
And these centers represent all the
evolution we have gone through.

00:12:44.151 --> 00:12:55.011
This is our past which is built-in within
us. And now, the last. The last is the

00:12:55.011 --> 00:13:02.592
seventh center of Sahastrara, which is in the
medical terminology called as Limbic area.

00:13:05.874 --> 00:13:17.584
It covers, like this, as a lotus and when the
Kundalini rises or awakens, it opens beautifully -

00:13:18.419 --> 00:13:27.839
in Sanskrit called as 'Sahastra Chedam'. Because
the Modern Science has come from West,

00:13:27.839 --> 00:13:31.785
that doesn't mean that India
never had any Science.

00:13:32.304 --> 00:13:42.054
It had very much advanced Science but the
attention of the saints and the scientists in those days

00:13:42.054 --> 00:13:52.080
was not on the material exploration but on the
inner being and that's how they discovered

00:13:53.394 --> 00:14:03.544
that within us are all these centers
which are the milestones of our evolution

00:14:04.264 --> 00:14:18.534
and also there is this power of Kundalini,
which has to be awakened by some authority,

00:14:18.534 --> 00:14:32.599
Spiritual authority and if it is awakened,
then it passes through these six centers,

00:14:32.599 --> 00:14:39.207
not the seventh one but the six centers -
the seventh one, also called as the first one,

00:14:39.207 --> 00:14:48.924
is below the Kundalini, to pierce through
the fontanel bone area, which gives you

00:14:48.924 --> 00:14:57.315
the actualization of Self-realization, which
you call as baptism. It's nothing artificial

00:14:58.265 --> 00:15:05.405
Now is the inner [UNCLEAR] to do, to be
treated as a hypothesis, if you are a scientist

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:09.943
and keep your mind open and see for
yourself it is working or not.

00:15:10.181 --> 00:15:23.111
If it works, it is the Truth and once you 
have an open mind and the half-baked people,

00:15:23.111 --> 00:15:32.777
who are neither here nor there, have no
idea as to what was the knowledge we had

00:15:32.777 --> 00:15:40.607
in our country for centuries and that is
knowledge of roots to give Self-realization.

00:15:44.173 --> 00:15:54.363
Of course it was not given to each and
every person. Very selective after they

00:15:54.363 --> 00:16:06.019
self-validated, like Raja Janaka, who gave
Self-realization to Nachiketa, after taking

00:16:06.019 --> 00:16:16.797
his test for days together but today it is
very different. As I told you yesterday,

00:16:16.797 --> 00:16:24.748
it is the blossom time. This is the promised time
of Last judgment. Even in the Koran it is said

00:16:24.748 --> 00:16:34.496
that 'Your hands will speak when the Kiama
will come,' means the resurrection time.

00:16:34.496 --> 00:16:47.090
When the resurrection time will come, then your
hands will speak. It is said in all our Scriptures,

00:16:48.277 --> 00:16:56.347
whether it is in India, China or anywhere,
that you have to get your Self-realization.

00:16:57.911 --> 00:17:04.391
That is the most important thing about
which Buddha also wrote and Mahavira

00:17:04.391 --> 00:17:12.255
also emphasized. They did not want to talk of
God even because if they start talking of God,

00:17:12.255 --> 00:17:20.258
then people just become enamored by that
because they say they are God or the people

00:17:20.258 --> 00:17:24.953
start thinking, "Oh, we have one God,
so it's alright. We can do what we like,

00:17:24.953 --> 00:17:33.562
God will look after us." Then your desire,
you have your Self-realization.

00:17:33.562 --> 00:17:39.440
As we have many in India, they think, if
they go to the temple their spirituality

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:45.689
is over. If they, in the morning, do little pooja
in the house, then their spirituality is over.

00:17:47.146 --> 00:17:58.296
It is not. You have to get your Self-realization.
That is, your Spirit has to come in your attention.

00:17:59.226 --> 00:18:12.126
The Spirit is the witness of the play. It's
watching the play of all your activities, everything

00:18:12.873 --> 00:18:19.823
but is not in your attention but when you
get your realization, then the Spirit

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:37.840
comes as light in your attention and you get
Bodha. The Christians, who were just after Christ,

00:18:38.114 --> 00:18:44.914
got realization, were called as Gnostics.
Now the word 'gna' as you know 'gyana',

00:18:45.058 --> 00:18:52.768
we say gyana. 'Gna' means knowledge.
Knowledge is not mental knowledge but

00:18:52.768 --> 00:18:59.323
knowledge on your Central Nervous system.
And these gnostics were tortured and troubled

00:18:59.323 --> 00:19:06.201
by many bishops and who called them, this
is a blasphemy, they have no powers.

00:19:07.024 --> 00:19:12.354
As a result, when Thomas when he was
coming - the disciple of Christ, Saint Thomas -

00:19:12.354 --> 00:19:20.653
when he was coming to India, he wrote all
the treatise and hid them in a beautiful jar

00:19:20.653 --> 00:19:27.297
in Egypt, which was found only about 50 years
back and now being decoded and surprisingly

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:38.650
it's called third [UNCLEAR] that, it is a 
spontaneous happening that has to come

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:47.718
within you and that has to give you enlightenment.
But this book is now going to be banned, I think,

00:19:47.718 --> 00:19:55.800
because it's just going against all these churches
and all these people, who have created huge, big

00:19:55.800 --> 00:20:04.900
organizations in the name of God and Christ.
Because it is talking about Self realization only.

00:20:09.499 --> 00:20:17.499
Also we have in the West, another problem of
people who call themselves intellectuals,

00:20:17.499 --> 00:20:25.271
who are rather perverted in their brains. They want
to deny all that has been written down so far,

00:20:26.173 --> 00:20:33.193
they don't want to accept that there is
God, with them Spirituality is a myth

00:20:34.703 --> 00:20:39.617
and they are only there to criticize
everything that is in them.

00:20:42.453 --> 00:20:49.833
This criticism in the West, I know presently things
are too much and as a result of this criticism,

00:20:50.684 --> 00:20:59.304
not only of God but of beauty and of all
beautiful creations of artists criticize,

00:20:59.499 --> 00:21:09.659
so there are no more Rembrandts, no more
Michaelangelos - they're all finished.

00:21:10.267 --> 00:21:19.747
No body will have even strength to come up to
say that, "We are artists." This is the situation.

00:21:22.294 --> 00:21:31.054
This intellectual criticism has become
a gift built-in in the West. I hope this

00:21:31.054 --> 00:21:35.877
doesn't trickle down to our country though
our media has to be very careful.

00:21:36.576 --> 00:21:45.396
To keep to their personality as Indians
and not as Western journalists, who want

00:21:45.396 --> 00:21:52.542
to have all the time something stupid and
controversial. The other day, I asked some

00:21:52.542 --> 00:21:58.865
journalist that, "Why are you writing all these
things about Me." He said, "Mother, I must confess

00:21:58.865 --> 00:22:06.149
that as I am a scoundrel." I said, "Better
write that instead of writing such a thing."

00:22:06.392 --> 00:22:14.672
So all these things are there which are working
as negative forces and this is the best time

00:22:15.625 --> 00:22:22.795
for you to have your ascent, to get to
your Spirit, to know your Spirit.

00:22:24.138 --> 00:22:30.148
This is true as [UNCLEAR] has said that,
"Once you get your Self-realization,

00:22:30.618 --> 00:22:39.426
most of your problems just disappear." Now
how it happens, how these problems disappear?

00:22:40.879 --> 00:22:47.839
Supposing, you are standing in the deep 
water and you see waves coming and going

00:22:47.839 --> 00:22:52.028
and you are afraid of these waves. You're 
watching them and you are all the time

00:22:52.028 --> 00:22:57.039
frightened that now I'll be drowned but
supposing you are saved and put on a boat,

00:22:58.259 --> 00:23:05.729
then you can watch these waves, also enjoy
them. But supposing you learn swimming,

00:23:05.729 --> 00:23:12.864
you become a master of swimming, you can
jump down and save others. Today that kind of a

00:23:12.864 --> 00:23:20.783
special atmosphere is around, as I told you
yesterday, that this All-Pervading Power

00:23:21.183 --> 00:23:28.708
has become now dynamic because it is
Kritayuga and this dynamism of this Kritayuga

00:23:29.038 --> 00:23:37.568
is going to work out everything so beautifully,
so miraculously, that you can't believe

00:23:38.774 --> 00:23:47.124
because the Divine itself, is very anxious
that you should enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:23:48.135 --> 00:23:54.015
And that's how it is going to work out but
those people, who are going to shun the Truth

00:23:54.015 --> 00:24:02.685
and those who have also shut their eyes to the
Reality, will be responsible for misleading others.

00:24:05.394 --> 00:24:09.714
But what is the advantage, why
should we do it?

00:24:10.145 --> 00:24:20.095
By doing this kind of destructive work,
what is the result?

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:28.910
What are we going to get out of it?
Instead of that, why not see for yourself,

00:24:29.031 --> 00:24:37.131
if it is possible to give realization to
thousands of people and if, transformation

00:24:37.131 --> 00:24:44.077
of these lives is possible, why shouldn't
we all work it out to say to the whole world?

00:24:44.077 --> 00:24:52.336
And if in this country of ours, which I know is the
holy country, we can do it better than anyone else,

00:24:52.336 --> 00:24:57.802
why not we, instead of following this kind
of a group and that kind of a sangha,

00:24:57.802 --> 00:25:07.606
why not we become the Spirit, the powerful
Spirit and the power is that of love.

00:25:09.734 --> 00:25:18.264
Love, which is like the sap in the tree, rises,
goes to the various areas, it is either

00:25:18.264 --> 00:25:27.612
evaporated or it comes back to the roots. It
does not get attached to any part, to any flower

00:25:28.221 --> 00:25:35.701
because if it gets involved into one flower, the
tree will be killed and the flower will be killed.

00:25:38.095 --> 00:25:47.375
This love, which you call as Nirvaajya in
Sanskrit language, is the power of God's love,

00:25:48.001 --> 00:25:57.661
which is so encouraging, so considerate,
so delicately it works out everything.

00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:10.630
Now think of a seed, if you plant it in the soil,
how the root comes out and at the end of the root

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:18.036
there is a very small little cell, which
is very intelligent, which goes around

00:26:18.357 --> 00:26:24.747
and sees the passage if it is there and
supposing there is a boulder, then it goes

00:26:24.747 --> 00:26:29.654
round that boulder, to create a support
for the future tree.

00:26:31.022 --> 00:26:38.012
From where does this intelligence come?
It's from the same Power of Love of God.

00:26:39.798 --> 00:26:54.278
This Power of Love is so kind, so generous,
it forgives whatever we might have done.

00:26:54.278 --> 00:27:00.034
It does not want to bother you about what
has happened or what you have been doing,

00:27:00.034 --> 00:27:06.673
what wrong you have done - no. It's only
aim is to give you your Self-realization.

00:27:09.579 --> 00:27:22.399
And later on to give you all the proof, all the
pranmaan, that there is God and there is His love,

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:33.460
which looks after, which guides us, which
gives us all the blessings that we want.

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:49.010
These blessings are already there but we
cannot receive it. If you go to the river Ganges

00:27:50.444 --> 00:27:59.544
and do not want to fill your pitcher, the
river Ganges cannot do anything about it.

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:10.900
You have to have desire yourself to
get the nectar of these blessings.

00:28:12.362 --> 00:28:24.132
When we think about ourselves, we think a very
mundane manner but we are not mundane people.

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:31.620
As I told you yesterday, look at our eyes, what
a camera, look at our brain, what a computer!

00:28:32.071 --> 00:28:41.851
We are not mundane, we are not ordinary people,
we are not animals. We are much above all of them.

00:28:42.941 --> 00:28:52.884
Just a little more journey for you to be
that state of bliss. It is to be experienced.

00:28:52.884 --> 00:29:00.173
Yesterday all of you felt the cool breeze
of the Holy Ghost, as they say, which is

00:29:00.173 --> 00:29:08.103
described by Adi Shakaracharya 'Saleelam,
saleelam' means He's called this Saundrya Lahiri

00:29:10.871 --> 00:29:17.851
They always felt in olden days are those
which have written that they are in a realm

00:29:17.857 --> 00:29:25.037
where people are not yet and how to bring
them up within. Kabira has said,

00:29:25.037 --> 00:29:29.278
[HINDI COUPLET - Kaise samjahaoon sab jag
andha] means, how to make them understand ,
the whole world is blind.

00:29:29.458 --> 00:29:37.148
It is very, very difficult to convince people
that there is another beautiful world waiting

00:29:37.148 --> 00:29:46.117
for you, to receive you - very difficult. To them
these mundane things are reality - but is not -

00:29:46.607 --> 00:29:59.409
and this, if you can ask within yourself,
you can get it because the biggest time of

00:29:59.409 --> 00:30:07.003
blossoming has come and this is really a
very, very great time that you are born

00:30:07.048 --> 00:30:16.078
at this time in this country. We have to
understand our concern, which is very great

00:30:16.078 --> 00:30:24.819
based on pujas. All the culture is built on
pujas. Also in West it was [UNCLEAR] it was

00:30:24.819 --> 00:30:32.983
but not anymore, not anymore. But even
now in our country we have this puja,

00:30:32.983 --> 00:30:42.193
which is built-in within us and the sense of
morality is there. But, despite all these things,

00:30:44.067 --> 00:30:51.147
our attention is not towards God. Our
attention is not towards becoming the Spirit.

00:30:52.001 --> 00:30:57.581
We have very funny ideas that if we become
the Spirit, God knows what will happen,

00:30:57.581 --> 00:31:01.350
will be become a sanyasi, we'll have to leave
our treasures, we'll have to go away.

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:09.253
In Sahaja yoga you don't have to leave
anything, you become within yourself.

00:31:10.575 --> 00:31:17.685
It's the becoming which is important. We do not
have anymore [UNCLEAR] it's the becoming.

00:31:17.685 --> 00:31:23.496
And the becoming is only possible that once
you get your Self-realization, you have to

00:31:23.496 --> 00:31:29.295
go to the Collective, as I told you yesterday
but when you go to the collective, there only

00:31:29.295 --> 00:31:38.400
the cleansing will take place automatically.
You all have heard many a times about Kundalini

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:45.005
and the chakras [UNCLEAR] also for 
you to see.

00:31:45.005 --> 00:31:52.283
But the actual experience of Self-realization is
what you should ask for, otherwise what's the use?

00:31:52.402 --> 00:31:58.622
There are so many people giving lectures all over.
What's the use of listening to any lecture?

00:31:58.713 --> 00:32:06.623
We have had enough of this - the brain is
full of it but now no more of these talks.

00:32:06.623 --> 00:32:19.736
In Maharashtra it is said [MARATHI COUPLET].
Let us have it. Thus great joy which is promised

00:32:19.736 --> 00:32:31.357
to us in all the scriptures. It's very easy, it's
Sahaja and I'm surprised because how people,

00:32:31.357 --> 00:32:41.372
who, I never expect, just jump so deep
and understand. For example,

00:32:41.372 --> 00:32:45.455
[UNCLEAR]

00:32:46.085 --> 00:32:54.553
but in God realization, the way you
understood it in such a short time

00:32:54.913 --> 00:33:01.444
I thought already you people were Sahaja
[UNCLEAR]

00:33:03.014 --> 00:33:10.274
There are many people like that, whom I've
met, they may be rich or poor, maybe anywhere,

00:33:10.393 --> 00:33:20.923
who just immediately get the experience
and also know the greatness within them.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:39.200
Deep, inside of us, is the ocean of bliss, of
joy but we have to take our attention inside

00:33:39.526 --> 00:33:46.956
and that only happens when Kundalini rises,
your attention is taken inside and you feel it.

00:33:47.552 --> 00:33:54.902
This is what it is one has to ask for. The
rest of the things you'll find are insipid

00:33:54.902 --> 00:34:01.581
and useless. No use wasting time for
these things but to enjoy yourself.

00:34:03.317 --> 00:34:16.887
How it happens, how a seed sprouts. You
sow a seed. The seed has all the maps of

00:34:16.887 --> 00:34:23.123
all the trees it is going to produce, it has
an idea and this Mother Earth has the power

00:34:23.123 --> 00:34:30.529
to germinate it - that's all. You don't
have to stand on your head, you don't have

00:34:30.529 --> 00:34:40.192
to go to read some book or to [UNCLEAR]
idea. It is so spontaneous,

00:34:40.192 --> 00:34:52.288
it is so simple. This simple trait is to be
enjoyed, that's what we're here for, today

00:34:52.288 --> 00:35:04.778
and I think, I should now request you all to get
your realization but people who are intelligent,

00:35:05.764 --> 00:35:11.674
really super intelligent, I should say,
jump into Sahaja yoga very fast.

00:35:13.149 --> 00:35:19.259
We had people in Sahaja yoga, who always
got a top degree, were first class first

00:35:20.231 --> 00:35:30.401
and also those who are very dedicated and
very affectionate, simple people, get their

00:35:30.401 --> 00:35:39.363
realization without any difficulty. It is
very surprising and amazing, how in the villages -

00:35:39.363 --> 00:35:45.311
this time I went to Srirampur, there were many
people, about a thousand people there and

00:35:45.311 --> 00:35:53.651
each one of them got realization. So it is
working so fast. As I told you yesterday,

00:35:53.651 --> 00:36:00.523
no organization can work that fast as it
is working. We have no membership, we have

00:36:00.523 --> 00:36:07.677
no register of members - nothing but people
are becoming Sahaja yogis, all over the world.

00:36:09.473 --> 00:36:21.913
So, as is here, basically as Maharashtrians,
people who speak Marathi, we have great capacity

00:36:22.927 --> 00:36:35.297
to express our Spirituality to others. Our
young boys, our younger women have really

00:36:35.297 --> 00:36:43.509
sparked the whole country. Instead of wasting
their time in drugs and nonsensical things

00:36:43.509 --> 00:36:54.042
they have really achieved self vision because,
as I told you yesterday, that now the

00:36:54.042 --> 00:37:02.018
time of Bodhisattwa, the future Buddha has
come. At the time of Buddha, it was all

00:37:02.018 --> 00:37:16.251
kinds of rituals and all kinds of hardship,
individual progress was there to achieve the

00:37:16.251 --> 00:37:26.240
state of Buddha - bodh. Bodh, meaning, to
know on you Central Nervous System but in

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:35.502
the future, the Bodhisattwa has to come
and the Bodhisattwa is the one, who receives

00:37:35.502 --> 00:37:43.691
Self-realization because he's Buddha but
he's capable of giving realization to others,

00:37:44.959 --> 00:37:51.289
if he has come as the benevolent of the
whole society. He works for the benevolence

00:37:51.289 --> 00:37:57.317
of the society. He doesn't have to run away from
the society, he doesn't have to take to sanyasa,

00:37:57.317 --> 00:38:05.472
nothing of the kind but he becomes that and he
gives it to others. This is what is a Bodhisattwa

00:38:05.472 --> 00:38:14.820
and this is the time of Bodhisattwa. Buddha's
time now over, Christ's time now over.

00:38:15.392 --> 00:38:21.902
Now whatever They have prophesied, this
is the time to be fulfilled and we all,

00:38:21.951 --> 00:38:28.681
whatever religion we may follow, whatever ideas
we may have, we take to our Self-realization

00:38:28.895 --> 00:38:39.845
and then see everything in the light of our
Spirit. I hope you people have understood

00:38:39.859 --> 00:38:49.769
what is My desire is. I'm quite desirous that
all of you should not only get your Self-realization

00:38:49.769 --> 00:38:58.850
but you should go deep into your own being
and all your powers should be expressed.

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:05.064
A Mother wants that Her child should be
greater than the Mother - why not?

00:39:05.245 --> 00:39:16.735
You can do it, you should try. Just work it
out in a very simple way. As I requested you,

00:39:16.735 --> 00:39:21.941
that you have to go to the collective, if
you want to have your cleansing done,

00:39:21.941 --> 00:39:30.670
forgetting what is your position, what is
your [UNCLEAR] and you'll be surprised,

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:35.706
in that collective the microcosm of 
yours will become the macrocosm -

00:39:36.267 --> 00:39:47.377
a drop becomes the ocean. That's what you have
to become - the ocean, as that was [UNCLEAR]

00:39:47.377 --> 00:39:54.929
in Pasayadaan, for which things have been
described very beautifully, is the modern times,

00:39:54.929 --> 00:40:07.634
where He says that, 'Let the forests of 
Kalptaru walk - they are Sahaja yogis,

00:40:09.777 --> 00:40:22.432
let the ocean of talking Ambrosia walk go
ahead - what are, they are Sahaja yogis

00:40:23.532 --> 00:40:27.812
and they become your relations
taking towards Sahaja Yog.

00:40:29.527 --> 00:40:36.267
Gyaneshwara has seen the vision of Yoga,
meaning the sustenance [UNCLEAR]

00:40:36.267 --> 00:40:41.767
He has seen the vision of all the saints,
[UNCLEAR]

00:40:41.767 --> 00:40:48.068
He has seen the vision of these
happenings He has described very clearly,

00:40:48.276 --> 00:40:57.736
very clearly. And also he had written it
long time back. Bhrigumuni has described

00:40:57.736 --> 00:41:04.573
the time when the Kundalini will rise and people
will achieve their good health and good mind.

00:41:04.989 --> 00:41:10.649
It's all described all the people will be
realized and the time has come when

00:41:10.649 --> 00:41:15.282
you should have whatever has been 
prophesized and whatever has been promised.

00:41:17.127 --> 00:41:24.587
So why not, we take the full advantage
of it. I'm trying to give you

00:41:24.847 --> 00:41:31.807
[UNCLEAR] where you can really understand
that we haven't got the Absolute,

00:41:31.807 --> 00:41:37.145
we have to get to the Absolute
and this is very important

00:41:37.145 --> 00:41:41.934
because we are living in a relative world
and crossing from this end to that end.

00:41:43.187 --> 00:41:54.627
So we have to be in the Absolute. I wish
today, all of you get your realization and

00:41:54.627 --> 00:42:03.805
you go in the collective and master this,
master this Shudh Vidya (Pure Knowledge).

00:42:03.805 --> 00:42:11.334
You have to know all about it. 
May God bless you!
