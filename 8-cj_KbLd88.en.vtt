Sahasrara Puja, Paris, France, 1982.05.05

00:00:15.038 --> 00:00:22.894
Today, it’s a great day for all of us, the seekers,

00:00:23.095 --> 00:00:30.512
that the last work of the Divine,

00:00:30.713 --> 00:00:37.566
of opening the last centre

00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:46.206
in the Great Primordial Being, was done on the 5th of May 1970.

00:00:47.232 --> 00:00:58.028
It is the greatest event of all the spiritual happenings of the Universe.

00:01:00.711 --> 00:01:10.307
It was done with very great care and great adjustments.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:23.183
It is not in the limits of human understanding,

00:01:23.384 --> 00:01:28.639
how things are worked in the heavens.

00:01:29.541 --> 00:01:39.147
It is your fortune and God’s love

00:01:39.348 --> 00:01:44.762
that has worked out this wondrous miracle.

00:01:46.353 --> 00:01:52.594
Without this happening, there could not have been

00:01:52.795 --> 00:02:01.330
a possibility to give mass Realisation to people.

00:02:01.876 --> 00:02:06.608
One could have done it for one or two persons here and there,

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:14.406
but to give such a mass awakening could not have been possible.

00:02:18.117 --> 00:02:28.828
As you know, in the Sahasrara, there are the seats of the seven main chakras.

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:40.858
There are one thousand nadis or, as they call it, flames,

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:48.912
and they all have each sixteen thousand powers.

00:02:51.087 --> 00:03:03.840
Every nadi deals with a particular type of a person

00:03:04.041 --> 00:03:10.595
and, with the permutations and combinations

00:03:10.796 --> 00:03:19.685
of all these nadis, human beings are looked after.

00:03:21.741 --> 00:03:26.236
As soon as Sahasrara was opened,

00:03:26.437 --> 00:03:38.946
the whole atmosphere was filled with tremendous chaitanya

00:03:39.147 --> 00:03:45.981
and there was tremendous light in the sky,

00:03:46.182 --> 00:03:50.498
and the whole thing came on this Earth

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:59.452
as if a torrential rain or a waterfall,

00:03:59.653 --> 00:04:04.966
with such a tremendous force,

00:04:05.167 --> 00:04:12.220
as if I was unaware and got stupefied.

00:04:14.622 --> 00:04:23.133
The happening was so unexpected and so tremendous that I was stunned

00:04:23.334 --> 00:04:31.397
and I became completely silent at its grandeur.

00:04:32.609 --> 00:04:44.859
I saw the primordial Kundalini rising like a big furnace,

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:55.684
and the furnace was very silent but a burning appearance it had:

00:04:57.079 --> 00:05:03.147
as if you heat up some metal and it has many colours, in the same way,

00:05:03.348 --> 00:05:10.244
the Kundalini showed up like a huge furnace, you can say;

00:05:10.445 --> 00:05:15.518
a furnace which is like a tunnel,

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:31.468
where you see these plants you have for coal burning to create electricity;

00:05:32.766 --> 00:05:37.410
and it stretched like a telescope one after another,

00:05:37.611 --> 00:05:43.420
it came out, shoot, shoot, shoot, like that.

00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:52.694
And the Deities came and sat on their seats,

00:05:52.895 --> 00:05:57.278
on their golden seats,

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:07.124
and then they lifted the whole of the head,

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:10.242
like a big dome,

00:06:10.443 --> 00:06:13.924
and opened it,

00:06:14.515 --> 00:06:20.585
and then this torrential rain

00:06:20.786 --> 00:06:25.781
completely drenched me

00:06:28.732 --> 00:06:35.536
and I started seeing all that and got lost into the joy.

00:06:37.064 --> 00:06:44.580
It was like an artist seeing its own creation fulfilled.

00:06:44.781 --> 00:06:49.783
I felt the joy of great fulfilment.

00:06:52.494 --> 00:07:02.809
After coming out of that beautiful experience

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:11.709
I looked around and I saw human beings so blind

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.791
and I became absolutely silent.

00:07:20.619 --> 00:07:27.866
Then I desired that I should get the cups to fill this nectar.

00:07:30.407 --> 00:07:35.139
But I saw all stones.

00:07:39.212 --> 00:07:48.235
Sahasrara is the most beautiful part of your being.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:56.292
It is a big lotus with one thousand petals of different colours

00:07:56.493 --> 00:08:02.596
appearing like inflated flames.

00:08:04.304 --> 00:08:12.875
It is a thing which is seen by many people

00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:20.849
but to see it pour that torrential rain

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:27.799
was like these flames becoming a fountain,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.467
fountain of colours and of fragrance.

00:08:35.334 --> 00:08:43.147
Can you think of a flower pouring its colour and its fragrance around?

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:50.253
People have written very little about Sahasrara,

00:08:50.454 --> 00:08:57.817
because whatever they have seen is from outside

00:08:58.018 --> 00:09:03.757
and it’s not possible for them to go from inside.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:08.948
Even if you reach from inside, if the whole Sahasrara is not opened out,

00:09:09.149 --> 00:09:13.878
you cannot see its beauty;

00:09:14.079 --> 00:09:18.677
because when it is closed, the whole of it, the total,

00:09:18.878 --> 00:09:25.030
then you just pass through a little aperture and get out of it.

00:09:25.713 --> 00:09:35.171
But just imagine a huge big petaled, thousand petaled lotus,

00:09:35.372 --> 00:09:43.469
and you are sitting inside, in the corona and looking at all these petals —

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.886
all very beautifully coloured, and fragrant,

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:54.232
and pulsating with the bliss and the joy.

00:10:01.507 --> 00:10:10.715
To remain into Sahasrara, on that position, is the ideal situation.

00:10:12.143 --> 00:10:24.521
But then, after the silence, you are filled with tremendous compassion and love,

00:10:24.722 --> 00:10:32.914
and you are drawn out to people

00:10:33.115 --> 00:10:41.841
who haven’t yet known what is having eyes.

00:10:43.542 --> 00:10:48.050
And thus you try to put your attention

00:10:48.251 --> 00:10:53.138
to the Sahasrara of millions of people,

00:10:54.255 --> 00:11:00.078
and then you start seeing the problems that exist in the Sahasrara.

00:11:01.187 --> 00:11:13.371
And even if you desire to open the Sahasrara it is a very difficult thing

00:11:13.572 --> 00:11:21.811
because the channelising from the Divine to human beings

00:11:22.012 --> 00:11:26.839
has to be through human beings.

00:11:27.629 --> 00:11:30.384
The power could be with you,

00:11:30.585 --> 00:11:36.150
but it has to be channelised through human element.

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:46.244
All My life I had not known many realised-souls.

00:11:47.532 --> 00:11:51.990
How to get them?

00:11:52.902 --> 00:11:57.636
How to work it out?

00:11:59.241 --> 00:12:04.926
So I started looking out for people,

00:12:05.127 --> 00:12:12.231
and I met one old lady of seventy years,

00:12:12.432 --> 00:12:18.190
and she was very perturbed about something very gross;

00:12:18.991 --> 00:12:24.332
and when she came to Me she felt very peaceful.

00:12:25.338 --> 00:12:29.533
Her Sahasrara was very worn out.

00:12:30.648 --> 00:12:39.354
And in My company she would think of something else, not of the Spirit.

00:12:41.159 --> 00:12:46.860
And her brain would be covered with clouds

00:12:47.061 --> 00:12:51.097
and darkness.

00:12:51.298 --> 00:12:57.149
Again and again I had to enlighten it

00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:01.483
but she did not get her Realisation.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:09.113
Most of the people who came to Me in the beginning came for getting cured.

00:13:09.991 --> 00:13:14.381
This capacity I had from childhood.

00:13:14.967 --> 00:13:20.553
And I could also give Realisation to a few people before,

00:13:20.754 --> 00:13:25.538
but they had to be very earnest – ardent.

00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:31.991
I didn’t meet any one of that quality

00:13:32.192 --> 00:13:35.054
because I was not living in the forest,

00:13:35.255 --> 00:13:44.491
I was living as a normal human being among other normal human beings,

00:13:44.692 --> 00:13:51.236
and they were not that earnest, that aartha,

00:13:51.437 --> 00:13:56.531
and I had to do this work among them.

00:13:59.031 --> 00:14:06.481
How to talk to them about the real world that
exists and the false [one] in which they live?

00:14:07.849 --> 00:14:14.222
And one lady, the first one who got Realisation, just came to see Me

00:14:14.423 --> 00:14:22.922
because she was possessed with the idea of seeking, she thought,

00:14:23.123 --> 00:14:28.347
and it worked in her.

00:14:28.771 --> 00:14:32.960
That was not the happiest day,

00:14:33.161 --> 00:14:39.781
because she’s one of those who get individually Realisation.

00:14:40.136 --> 00:14:45.759
With this great happening many should get at a time.

00:14:47.325 --> 00:14:52.264
We had a programme in Bordi

00:14:52.465 --> 00:14:56.960
in ’70,

00:14:57.447 --> 00:15:04.412
and there, first, one gentleman got Realisation in the evening.

00:15:05.008 --> 00:15:12.842
Next day there were negative forces acting [in the] morning time,

00:15:13.043 --> 00:15:18.275
and they started talking of favouritism.

00:15:18.926 --> 00:15:24.901
I could see in the atmosphere the vibrations were going wrong.

00:15:25.497 --> 00:15:32.946
In the evening I took up a very strong, firm attitude.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:37.572
I was in a great fury.

00:15:38.157 --> 00:15:43.309
I had never gone into such a fury before

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:48.391
and I lashed out at them.

00:15:49.194 --> 00:15:54.793
Surprisingly, twelve of them got Realisation,

00:15:54.994 --> 00:16:00.036
That was the greatest moment.

00:16:00.524 --> 00:16:06.207
Then many got, one by one.

00:16:06.771 --> 00:16:10.348
Three of them who were travelling back, got Realisation.

00:16:10.549 --> 00:16:15.105
Suddenly, in the train, they felt the vibrations.

00:16:17.578 --> 00:16:23.394
So the mass evolution started.

00:16:24.645 --> 00:16:29.969
Sahasrara is your awareness.

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:35.085
When it is enlightened

00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:42.571
you get into the technique of the Divine.

00:16:43.834 --> 00:16:51.599
Now there are two techniques: the technique of
the Divine, and the technique that you follow.

00:16:52.771 --> 00:17:02.119
You cannot act as Divine, but you can use the Divine power and manoeuvre it.

00:17:02.792 --> 00:17:10.346
For example, Divine looks after all the Universal happenings:

00:17:10.547 --> 00:17:16.590
every minutest particle is controlled by Divine.

00:17:17.278 --> 00:17:22.269
When your Sahasrara opens out

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:31.397
and your Kundalini touches the fontanelle bone,

00:17:32.946 --> 00:17:39.249
sort of an igniting force is ready in your Sahasrara,

00:17:40.201 --> 00:17:49.280
and as soon as the fontanelle bone area opens up through the Brahmarandhra,

00:17:49.481 --> 00:17:58.334
the grace of your Spirit ignites that igniting force

00:17:58.535 --> 00:18:04.649
and your nadis get enlightened;

00:18:05.402 --> 00:18:08.091
not all of them,

00:18:08.292 --> 00:18:10.863
quite a lot of them;

00:18:11.064 --> 00:18:16.153
not all the length,

00:18:16.354 --> 00:18:21.130
but quite the peripheries.

00:18:22.256 --> 00:18:26.928
That’s how you get your enlightenment.

00:18:27.795 --> 00:18:30.981
So many things happen

00:18:31.182 --> 00:18:38.005
because, also, of your seven centres being in the Sahasrara.

00:18:38.562 --> 00:18:43.245
With the light you see their relative positions.

00:18:44.347 --> 00:18:51.811
I mean you do not see, but it work in your conscious mind.

00:18:53.086 --> 00:18:58.706
Your conscious mind feels that integration within you.

00:19:00.857 --> 00:19:09.093
The rationality which is separated from the heart becomes one with the heart.

00:19:10.039 --> 00:19:14.526
It becomes one with your attention.

00:19:14.727 --> 00:19:19.447
Wherever your attention goes

00:19:19.648 --> 00:19:23.951
you act in a collective way.

00:19:25.483 --> 00:19:31.570
All the activities of your attention are blessed.

00:19:32.487 --> 00:19:38.383
The attention itself is effective.

00:19:38.592 --> 00:19:44.629
Your attention is very important,

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:49.343
your desires are even more important.

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:58.136
Because it is such an integrated thing, your desires and your attention become one.

00:19:58.493 --> 00:20:01.834
Whatever is good for the Spirit you desire

00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:09.794
and your attention goes to the thing, whichever is emitting the Spiritual power.

00:20:10.186 --> 00:20:14.642
The priorities change very fast.

00:20:14.831 --> 00:20:20.665
Those people who are primitive and not evolved

00:20:20.866 --> 00:20:25.236
may not find that happening

00:20:25.437 --> 00:20:31.353
but those who are over mentally developed,

00:20:31.554 --> 00:20:37.773
they actually have an attention which they try to test it.

00:20:38.463 --> 00:20:42.088
They first want to see how to raise the Kundalini.

00:20:42.309 --> 00:20:46.967
They want to see that it is logical.

00:20:47.764 --> 00:20:52.631
For a balanced person there’s no questioning at all.

00:20:52.832 --> 00:20:57.556
We have some people like that among us.

00:20:57.872 --> 00:21:02.956
They just became and they never questioned.

00:21:03.347 --> 00:21:07.677
They just settled down.

00:21:07.878 --> 00:21:13.026
They are innocent, they are intelligent,

00:21:13.227 --> 00:21:18.277
above all they are spiritual.

00:21:18.478 --> 00:21:20.918
But whatever may be the defect in the quality

00:21:21.119 --> 00:21:25.159
can be corrected through your Sahasrara.

00:21:26.316 --> 00:21:29.611
First of all you have to put down your ego

00:21:29.812 --> 00:21:34.570
because if ego is there it presses the Sahasrara.

00:21:35.058 --> 00:21:38.623
Also the super-ego must be reduced

00:21:38.824 --> 00:21:44.310
because it also presses the Sahasrara and gives pain.

00:21:46.743 --> 00:21:50.856
So to keep the Sahasrara in its healthy state

00:21:51.072 --> 00:21:58.230
one has to understand that the priorities are to be changed.

00:21:59.447 --> 00:22:06.197
Some people take time, so they have to put some deliberate effort.

00:22:07.149 --> 00:22:15.971
There are many books, if you read them, they suggest anti-God activities.

00:22:16.629 --> 00:22:21.524
An enlightened Sahasrara doesn’t like it,

00:22:21.725 --> 00:22:24.855
it closes back.

00:22:25.056 --> 00:22:28.032
That’s like a poison.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:33.214
It doesn’t like any poisonous thought to come in the mind.

00:22:33.415 --> 00:22:38.013
If you go about with the poison

00:22:38.214 --> 00:22:42.644
then it again closes.

00:22:43.169 --> 00:22:50.595
In the same way the people who are hot tempered, very much hot tempered,

00:22:50.796 --> 00:22:55.187
and all other problems of the ego,

00:22:55.388 --> 00:23:01.036
if they try to suppress the Sahasrara

00:23:01.237 --> 00:23:06.055
[then] also the Sahasrara starts closing down.

00:23:06.486 --> 00:23:12.039
Those people who have had conditioning from wrong gurus,

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.071
and wrong books,

00:23:15.272 --> 00:23:18.401
from wrong parents maybe,

00:23:18.602 --> 00:23:24.427
from a wrong country,

00:23:24.628 --> 00:23:29.322
from a wrong livelihood

00:23:29.523 --> 00:23:36.620
also do not allow the Sahasrara to grow in it’s healthy way.

00:23:37.173 --> 00:23:42.930
It is only the Sahasrara [that] has to grow, not the Spirit.

00:23:43.915 --> 00:23:46.314
The more sensitive the Sahasrara is,

00:23:46.515 --> 00:23:53.859
the more it receives the Spiritual qualities of the Spirit.

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:58.776
Actually the peace is felt in the Sahasrara.

00:23:58.997 --> 00:24:03.332
The bliss is also felt in the Sahasrara

00:24:03.533 --> 00:24:09.471
because that is the brain, and the brain is the epitome of our nervous system,

00:24:09.672 --> 00:24:14.857
central nervous system, of consciousness itself.

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:22.830
So only, merely, by opening Sahasrara, the work is not done.

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:28.201
We have to have more and more channels

00:24:28.402 --> 00:24:35.026
who will act on these nadis with their different powers,

00:24:35.227 --> 00:24:43.097
and who can work it out in a proper systematic manner.

00:24:43.956 --> 00:24:52.076
But those people who indulge into wasteful habits after Realisation,

00:24:52.277 --> 00:24:57.632
obstruct the flow of the nadis,

00:24:57.833 --> 00:25:02.864
and really are very harmful for the Virata.

00:25:03.626 --> 00:25:09.040
Such people should really leave Sahaja Yoga and spare [us].

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.815
Or such people should be asked to leave

00:25:13.016 --> 00:25:16.776
and one should severe relations with such people

00:25:16.977 --> 00:25:24.231
who is standing against such a great work of the Divine.

00:25:25.105 --> 00:25:28.425
The one who wants to develop on Sahasrara should know

00:25:28.626 --> 00:25:33.637
that he should not have bad company,

00:25:33.838 --> 00:25:37.110
but always have the company of the other sahaja yogis.

00:25:39.646 --> 00:25:43.638
He should not have his own holidays and her own time,

00:25:43.839 --> 00:25:46.495
but most of the time he should spend

00:25:46.696 --> 00:25:51.146
in the company of other sahaja yogis.

00:25:51.822 --> 00:25:57.103
After the Sahasrara, when you are above Sahasrara then you can

00:25:57.312 --> 00:26:07.244
see that it is very important that all these nadis must be kept together.

00:26:08.065 --> 00:26:17.230
And all the centres and the Deities must be kept awakened and integrated.

00:26:18.872 --> 00:26:23.834
This can be done even with a conscious effort

00:26:24.035 --> 00:26:30.065
by watching yourself, your thoughts.

00:26:30.266 --> 00:26:35.607
You will start seeing your ego and your superego.

00:26:35.919 --> 00:26:42.368
You will be able to see how you cheat yourself and you are dishonest to yourself,

00:26:42.569 --> 00:26:47.516
how you are convincing yourself that you are very good,

00:26:48.636 --> 00:26:53.023
how you are enjoying a ego trip.

00:26:54.260 --> 00:27:01.021
Sahaja Yoga is for people who are Spirits

00:27:01.222 --> 00:27:05.767
so all other things must drop out.

00:27:06.147 --> 00:27:11.171
All misidentifications must be dropped out.

00:27:11.372 --> 00:27:14.621
One can do it through conscious mind, as I said,

00:27:14.822 --> 00:27:21.663
that you can really correct yourself

00:27:21.864 --> 00:27:31.167
because after Realisation whatever you desire becomes a part of the Divine desire

00:27:31.368 --> 00:27:37.063
and whatever you do becomes a part of the Divine action.

00:27:37.618 --> 00:27:43.409
So one has to remember that with conscious effort

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:51.045
we can find out ourselves and see if we are really honest about it.

00:27:51.962 --> 00:27:54.858
If one is honest one can see that collectivity

00:27:55.059 --> 00:28:00.790
is the only way to expand your Sahasrara.

00:28:01.468 --> 00:28:05.573
For that tolerance is needed,

00:28:05.774 --> 00:28:08.872
wisdom is needed,

00:28:09.073 --> 00:28:14.326
and a stature is needed of a prophet,

00:28:14.527 --> 00:28:18.045
which you are,

00:28:20.547 --> 00:28:24.490
and you should talk like a prophet.

00:28:25.344 --> 00:28:31.075
Actually, you have to educate yourself.

00:28:31.276 --> 00:28:37.771
How does a prophet speaks? How does a prophet speak?

00:28:38.967 --> 00:28:45.393
This is not insincere or acting

00:28:45.594 --> 00:28:49.687
because now you are awakened.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:58.075
When you are not awakened then whatever you do like this is artificial.

00:29:01.583 --> 00:29:16.129
Sahasrara is the controlling, guiding, evolving force

00:29:17.452 --> 00:29:29.695
and so to keep it absolutely ready for growth and expansion

00:29:29.896 --> 00:29:37.120
one has to watch one’s own growth.

00:29:37.321 --> 00:29:42.380
Never justify your wrongdoings.

00:29:43.803 --> 00:29:50.462
If you start justifying, you are actually thinking about that.

00:29:50.975 --> 00:29:55.552
We have no time to think about oneself.

00:29:56.031 --> 00:30:00.555
You have to think of others

00:30:00.756 --> 00:30:04.831
because others are also in your brain;

00:30:05.032 --> 00:30:09.164
and when you start thinking of others,

00:30:09.365 --> 00:30:15.139
talking to them about their resurrection,

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:25.216
your Sahasrara will definitely increase in its size and in its sensibility.

00:30:25.846 --> 00:30:30.448
The sensitivity will also increase,

00:30:30.649 --> 00:30:34.437
the depth will also come in.

00:30:34.638 --> 00:30:40.674
It is just like a tree, when it grows, its roots spread very strong.

00:30:43.188 --> 00:30:48.337
So you have to come out of your shells

00:30:48.538 --> 00:30:52.552
and spread your wings.

00:30:52.753 --> 00:30:58.364
All small things of mind

00:30:58.565 --> 00:31:03.213
must be given up.

00:31:03.414 --> 00:31:11.216
You have to live like a very, huge, big personality

00:31:11.417 --> 00:31:15.876
which has to give support,

00:31:16.077 --> 00:31:19.865
guidance, help

00:31:20.066 --> 00:31:25.794
and awakening to thousands.

00:31:25.995 --> 00:31:34.207
If this Sahasrara Day in France,

00:31:34.408 --> 00:31:40.970
establishes a new dynamism

00:31:41.171 --> 00:31:55.196
in this country, I am sure that it will
catch up with the thought of the people.

00:31:55.397 --> 00:31:59.808
It will resound into their brains,

00:32:00.009 --> 00:32:04.906
their unconscious will transmit it into their being

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:12.455
and they will start thinking afresh.

00:32:13.135 --> 00:32:19.158
Now, new breakthroughs will take place,

00:32:19.359 --> 00:32:27.970
and people will start going towards Truth logically.

00:32:28.531 --> 00:32:32.565
They’ll come to right conclusions.

00:32:33.262 --> 00:32:38.827
They’ll drop out all that is useless and wasteful.

00:32:40.475 --> 00:32:45.323
Sahasrara is the throne for the Spirit

00:32:45.524 --> 00:32:50.945
and the bigger is the king, the bigger is the throne.

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:54.561
The way you treat your Spirit

00:32:54.762 --> 00:33:00.376
is expressed through the way you have your Sahasrara.

00:33:02.379 --> 00:33:10.296
As it is the seven chakras are seated in the Sahasrara,

00:33:10.497 --> 00:33:15.903
you become the master of all these seven chakras,

00:33:16.727 --> 00:33:23.259
and that’s how you can do Realisation, you can give Realisation.

00:33:23.907 --> 00:33:28.502
And then you can become a subtle being.

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:33.776
Through your conscious effort,

00:33:33.977 --> 00:33:40.134
you can enter into the beings of others and raise their Kundalini and correct them.

00:33:41.208 --> 00:33:45.434
Enlightenment of the Sahasrara also gives you a new sight

00:33:45.635 --> 00:33:52.788
to see all the sukshmas, all the subtle things in the atmosphere.

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:56.016
When you start developing higher and higher,

00:33:56.217 --> 00:34:02.362
you can see the vibrations as lights around you.

00:34:04.285 --> 00:34:07.655
You may not have any interest in many things

00:34:07.856 --> 00:34:15.375
but you’ll be amazed how you become the master of so many things.

00:34:16.365 --> 00:34:23.373
As if your brain is materialising whatever you have been desiring.

00:34:24.484 --> 00:34:33.655
And this is what is Krishna promised, who is actually the Virata.

00:34:34.633 --> 00:34:41.174
So you become the master of your brain

00:34:41.375 --> 00:34:46.544
because actually the Spirit is master of the brain.

00:34:46.745 --> 00:34:52.714
The more you start bringing Spirit into your attention,

00:34:52.915 --> 00:34:58.631
the more the Sahasrara increases in its size.

00:34:59.269 --> 00:35:04.443
And the light of that expands

00:35:04.644 --> 00:35:09.774
and you become [a] more powerful sahaja yogi.

00:35:12.115 --> 00:35:16.250
This is the greatest thing also for God Almighty

00:35:16.451 --> 00:35:27.022
to see that this has happened, so that He can,
for the time being, postpone His anger and wrath;

00:35:27.496 --> 00:35:36.338
so that He can forgive human beings for their mistakes,

00:35:36.539 --> 00:35:41.058
their obstinacy

00:35:41.259 --> 00:35:45.442
and childish pranks.

00:35:46.336 --> 00:35:50.859
Let the man rise

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:58.101
to see the glory and the greatness of his Father.

00:35:58.613 --> 00:36:06.858
Let him have so much of power that he can bear the compassion of God.

00:36:07.593 --> 00:36:12.628
Let the Sahasrara develop into such dimensions

00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:18.520
that it can execute

00:36:18.721 --> 00:36:25.896
the working of the Divine through his own conscious mind.

00:36:26.657 --> 00:36:30.635
The Sahasrara has one mantra, that is “Nirmala”,

00:36:30.836 --> 00:36:35.733
one must keep it clean, pure and immaculate.

00:36:36.488 --> 00:36:41.165
That is what is your job,

00:36:41.366 --> 00:36:46.990
is [to] try to keep it pure and clean.

00:36:48.957 --> 00:36:57.271
And this will definitely mark another step, another accelerated jump

00:36:57.472 --> 00:37:06.187
into a new dimension of many more human beings.

00:37:07.456 --> 00:37:11.698
It is a very great pleasure to be in Paris today,

00:37:11.899 --> 00:37:17.611
so that the whole world attention should be on Paris,

00:37:17.812 --> 00:37:25.635
on France, on this country which is really being cursed;

00:37:25.836 --> 00:37:30.771
neglected by all the deities,

00:37:30.972 --> 00:37:36.643
because human beings really went very wrong.

00:37:38.798 --> 00:37:47.534
Let all the Deities be settled down in this country

00:37:47.735 --> 00:37:53.587
because this is the attention,

00:37:53.788 --> 00:37:57.399
and attention, whatever attention we pay,

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:03.900
is reported to us through Sahasrara.

00:38:05.192 --> 00:38:12.506
So the Sahasrara of France may be opened out,

00:38:12.707 --> 00:38:19.419
so the attention of France should be directed towards Spirit,

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:24.153
and  towards the eternal life.

00:38:24.354 --> 00:38:28.725
Is [a] very important country,

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:35.882
that’s why I decided to have this day celebrated here.

00:38:36.897 --> 00:38:43.676
Now the responsibility on the French sahaja yogis is much greater.

00:38:44.424 --> 00:38:48.829
They have to change their methods

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:51.935
and styles.

00:38:52.136 --> 00:38:57.145
They should be very mild, gentle

00:38:57.346 --> 00:39:02.834
and healthy people

00:39:03.035 --> 00:39:09.251
but at the same time they should be very strong sahaja yogis,

00:39:09.452 --> 00:39:13.228
so that when others see them

00:39:13.429 --> 00:39:17.649
[they] find that superiority in them.

00:39:19.078 --> 00:39:23.500
Before the Sahasrara day we have had such a successful session.

00:39:23.701 --> 00:39:28.045
I am very happy about you.

00:39:28.347 --> 00:39:32.458
May God bless you all.

00:39:32.659 --> 00:39:38.192
Now I bless all the other centres,

00:39:38.393 --> 00:39:42.600
who have prayed and are praying;

00:39:42.801 --> 00:39:48.311
to give them a very developed Sahasrara,

00:39:48.512 --> 00:39:51.514
an enlightened one,

00:39:51.715 --> 00:39:56.727
that will separate them from their small shells.

00:39:57.311 --> 00:40:01.657
Let them expand so much,

00:40:01.858 --> 00:40:08.624
that they become one, one with the whole.

00:40:08.825 --> 00:40:13.340
May God bless you all.
