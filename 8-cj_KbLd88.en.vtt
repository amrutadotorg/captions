Sahasrara Puja, Paris, France, 1982.05.05

00:15.038 --> 00:22.894
Today, it’s a great day for all of us, the seekers,

00:23.095 --> 00:30.512
that the last work of the Divine,

00:30.713 --> 00:37.566
of opening the last centre

00:37.767 --> 00:46.206
in the Great Primordial Being, was done on the 5th of May 1970.

00:47.232 --> 00:58.028
It is the greatest event of all the spiritual happenings of the Universe.

01:00.711 --> 01:10.307
It was done with very great care and great adjustments.

01:12.040 --> 01:23.183
It is not in the limits of human understanding,

01:23.384 --> 01:28.639
how things are worked in the heavens.

01:29.541 --> 01:39.147
It is your fortune and God’s love

01:39.348 --> 01:44.762
that has worked out this wondrous miracle.

01:46.353 --> 01:52.594
Without this happening, there could not have been

01:52.795 --> 02:01.330
a possibility to give mass Realisation to people.

02:01.876 --> 02:06.608
One could have done it for one or two persons here and there,

02:06.809 --> 02:14.406
but to give such a mass awakening could not have been possible.

02:18.117 --> 02:28.828
As you know, in the Sahasrara, there are the seats of the seven main chakras.

02:30.109 --> 02:40.858
There are one thousand nadis or, as they call it, flames,

02:41.059 --> 02:48.912
and they all have each sixteen thousand powers.

02:51.087 --> 03:03.840
Every nadi deals with a particular type of a person

03:04.041 --> 03:10.595
and, with the permutations and combinations

03:10.796 --> 03:19.685
of all these nadis, human beings are looked after.

03:21.741 --> 03:26.236
As soon as Sahasrara was opened,

03:26.437 --> 03:38.946
the whole atmosphere was filled with tremendous chaitanya

03:39.147 --> 03:45.981
and there was tremendous light in the sky,

03:46.182 --> 03:50.498
and the whole thing came on this Earth

03:50.699 --> 03:59.452
as if a torrential rain or a waterfall,

03:59.653 --> 04:04.966
with such a tremendous force,

04:05.167 --> 04:12.220
as if I was unaware and got stupefied.

04:14.622 --> 04:23.133
The happening was so unexpected and so tremendous that I was stunned

04:23.334 --> 04:31.397
and I became completely silent at its grandeur.

04:32.609 --> 04:44.859
I saw the primordial Kundalini rising like a big furnace,

04:45.060 --> 04:55.684
and the furnace was very silent but a burning appearance it had:

04:57.079 --> 05:03.147
as if you heat up some metal and it has many colours, in the same way,

05:03.348 --> 05:10.244
the Kundalini showed up like a huge furnace, you can say;

05:10.445 --> 05:15.518
a furnace which is like a tunnel,

05:15.719 --> 05:31.468
where you see these plants you have for coal burning to create electricity;

05:32.766 --> 05:37.410
and it stretched like a telescope one after another,

05:37.611 --> 05:43.420
it came out, shoot, shoot, shoot, like that.

05:44.801 --> 05:52.694
And the Deities came and sat on their seats,

05:52.895 --> 05:57.278
on their golden seats,

05:57.479 --> 06:07.124
and then they lifted the whole of the head,

06:07.325 --> 06:10.242
like a big dome,

06:10.443 --> 06:13.924
and opened it,

06:14.515 --> 06:20.585
and then this torrential rain

06:20.786 --> 06:25.781
completely drenched me

06:28.732 --> 06:35.536
and I started seeing all that and got lost into the joy.

06:37.064 --> 06:44.580
It was like an artist seeing its own creation fulfilled.

06:44.781 --> 06:49.783
I felt the joy of great fulfilment.

06:52.494 --> 07:02.809
After coming out of that beautiful experience

07:03.010 --> 07:11.709
I looked around and I saw human beings so blind

07:11.910 --> 07:15.791
and I became absolutely silent.

07:20.619 --> 07:27.866
Then I desired that I should get the cups to fill this nectar.

07:30.407 --> 07:35.139
But I saw all stones.

07:39.212 --> 07:48.235
Sahasrara is the most beautiful part of your being.

07:50.280 --> 07:56.292
It is a big lotus with one thousand petals of different colours

07:56.493 --> 08:02.596
appearing like inflated flames.

08:04.304 --> 08:12.875
It is a thing which is seen by many people

08:13.076 --> 08:20.849
but to see it pour that torrential rain

08:21.050 --> 08:27.799
was like these flames becoming a fountain,

08:28.000 --> 08:34.467
fountain of colours and of fragrance.

08:35.334 --> 08:43.147
Can you think of a flower pouring its colour and its fragrance around?

08:44.450 --> 08:50.253
People have written very little about Sahasrara,

08:50.454 --> 08:57.817
because whatever they have seen is from outside

08:58.018 --> 09:03.757
and it’s not possible for them to go from inside.

09:04.040 --> 09:08.948
Even if you reach from inside, if the whole Sahasrara is not opened out,

09:09.149 --> 09:13.878
you cannot see its beauty;

09:14.079 --> 09:18.677
because when it is closed, the whole of it, the total,

09:18.878 --> 09:25.030
then you just pass through a little aperture and get out of it.

09:25.713 --> 09:35.171
But just imagine a huge big petaled, thousand petaled lotus,

09:35.372 --> 09:43.469
and you are sitting inside, in the corona and looking at all these petals —

09:43.670 --> 09:46.886
all very beautifully coloured, and fragrant,

09:47.087 --> 09:54.232
and pulsating with the bliss and the joy.

10:01.507 --> 10:10.715
To remain into Sahasrara, on that position, is the ideal situation.

10:12.143 --> 10:24.521
But then, after the silence, you are filled with tremendous compassion and love,

10:24.722 --> 10:32.914
and you are drawn out to people

10:33.115 --> 10:41.841
who haven’t yet known what is having eyes.

10:43.542 --> 10:48.050
And thus you try to put your attention

10:48.251 --> 10:53.138
to the Sahasrara of millions of people,

10:54.255 --> 11:00.078
and then you start seeing the problems that exist in the Sahasrara.

11:01.187 --> 11:13.371
And even if you desire to open the Sahasrara it is a very difficult thing

11:13.572 --> 11:21.811
because the channelising from the Divine to human beings

11:22.012 --> 11:26.839
has to be through human beings.

11:27.629 --> 11:30.384
The power could be with you,

11:30.585 --> 11:36.150
but it has to be channelised through human element.

11:37.822 --> 11:46.244
All My life I had not known many realised-souls.

11:47.532 --> 11:51.990
How to get them?

11:52.902 --> 11:57.636
How to work it out?

11:59.241 --> 12:04.926
So I started looking out for people,

12:05.127 --> 12:12.231
and I met one old lady of seventy years,

12:12.432 --> 12:18.190
and she was very perturbed about something very gross;

12:18.991 --> 12:24.332
and when she came to Me she felt very peaceful.

12:25.338 --> 12:29.533
Her Sahasrara was very worn out.

12:30.648 --> 12:39.354
And in My company she would think of something else, not of the Spirit.

12:41.159 --> 12:46.860
And her brain would be covered with clouds

12:47.061 --> 12:51.097
and darkness.

12:51.298 --> 12:57.149
Again and again I had to enlighten it

12:57.350 --> 13:01.483
but she did not get her Realisation.

13:02.360 --> 13:09.113
Most of the people who came to Me in the beginning came for getting cured.

13:09.991 --> 13:14.381
This capacity I had from childhood.

13:14.967 --> 13:20.553
And I could also give Realisation to a few people before,

13:20.754 --> 13:25.538
but they had to be very earnest – ardent.

13:26.473 --> 13:31.991
I didn’t meet any one of that quality

13:32.192 --> 13:35.054
because I was not living in the forest,

13:35.255 --> 13:44.491
I was living as a normal human being among other normal human beings,

13:44.692 --> 13:51.236
and they were not that earnest, that aartha,

13:51.437 --> 13:56.531
and I had to do this work among them.

13:59.031 --> 14:06.481
How to talk to them about the real world that
exists and the false [one] in which they live?

14:07.849 --> 14:14.222
And one lady, the first one who got Realisation, just came to see Me

14:14.423 --> 14:22.922
because she was possessed with the idea of seeking, she thought,

14:23.123 --> 14:28.347
and it worked in her.

14:28.771 --> 14:32.960
That was not the happiest day,

14:33.161 --> 14:39.781
because she’s one of those who get individually Realisation.

14:40.136 --> 14:45.759
With this great happening many should get at a time.

14:47.325 --> 14:52.264
We had a programme in Bordi

14:52.465 --> 14:56.960
in ’70,

14:57.447 --> 15:04.412
and there, first, one gentleman got Realisation in the evening.

15:05.008 --> 15:12.842
Next day there were negative forces acting [in the] morning time,

15:13.043 --> 15:18.275
and they started talking of favouritism.

15:18.926 --> 15:24.901
I could see in the atmosphere the vibrations were going wrong.

15:25.497 --> 15:32.946
In the evening I took up a very strong, firm attitude.

15:33.670 --> 15:37.572
I was in a great fury.

15:38.157 --> 15:43.309
I had never gone into such a fury before

15:43.510 --> 15:48.391
and I lashed out at them.

15:49.194 --> 15:54.793
Surprisingly, twelve of them got Realisation,

15:54.994 --> 16:00.036
That was the greatest moment.

16:00.524 --> 16:06.207
Then many got, one by one.

16:06.771 --> 16:10.348
Three of them who were travelling back, got Realisation.

16:10.549 --> 16:15.105
Suddenly, in the train, they felt the vibrations.

16:17.578 --> 16:23.394
So the mass evolution started.

16:24.645 --> 16:29.969
Sahasrara is your awareness.

16:30.170 --> 16:35.085
When it is enlightened

16:35.286 --> 16:42.571
you get into the technique of the Divine.

16:43.834 --> 16:51.599
Now there are two techniques: the technique of
the Divine, and the technique that you follow.

16:52.771 --> 17:02.119
You cannot act as Divine, but you can use the Divine power and manoeuvre it.

17:02.792 --> 17:10.346
For example, Divine looks after all the Universal happenings:

17:10.547 --> 17:16.590
every minutest particle is controlled by Divine.

17:17.278 --> 17:22.269
When your Sahasrara opens out

17:22.470 --> 17:31.397
and your Kundalini touches the fontanelle bone,

17:32.946 --> 17:39.249
sort of an igniting force is ready in your Sahasrara,

17:40.201 --> 17:49.280
and as soon as the fontanelle bone area opens up through the Brahmarandhra,

17:49.481 --> 17:58.334
the grace of your Spirit ignites that igniting force

17:58.535 --> 18:04.649
and your nadis get enlightened;

18:05.402 --> 18:08.091
not all of them,

18:08.292 --> 18:10.863
quite a lot of them;

18:11.064 --> 18:16.153
not all the length,

18:16.354 --> 18:21.130
but quite the peripheries.

18:22.256 --> 18:26.928
That’s how you get your enlightenment.

18:27.795 --> 18:30.981
So many things happen

18:31.182 --> 18:38.005
because, also, of your seven centres being in the Sahasrara.

18:38.562 --> 18:43.245
With the light you see their relative positions.

18:44.347 --> 18:51.811
I mean you do not see, but it work in your conscious mind.

18:53.086 --> 18:58.706
Your conscious mind feels that integration within you.

19:00.857 --> 19:09.093
The rationality which is separated from the heart becomes one with the heart.

19:10.039 --> 19:14.526
It becomes one with your attention.

19:14.727 --> 19:19.447
Wherever your attention goes

19:19.648 --> 19:23.951
you act in a collective way.

19:25.483 --> 19:31.570
All the activities of your attention are blessed.

19:32.487 --> 19:38.383
The attention itself is effective.

19:38.592 --> 19:44.629
Your attention is very important,

19:44.830 --> 19:49.343
your desires are even more important.

19:49.990 --> 19:58.136
Because it is such an integrated thing, your desires and your attention become one.

19:58.493 --> 20:01.834
Whatever is good for the Spirit you desire

20:02.035 --> 20:09.794
and your attention goes to the thing, whichever is emitting the Spiritual power.

20:10.186 --> 20:14.642
The priorities change very fast.

20:14.831 --> 20:20.665
Those people who are primitive and not evolved

20:20.866 --> 20:25.236
may not find that happening

20:25.437 --> 20:31.353
but those who are over mentally developed,

20:31.554 --> 20:37.773
they actually have an attention which they try to test it.

20:38.463 --> 20:42.088
They first want to see how to raise the Kundalini.

20:42.309 --> 20:46.967
They want to see that it is logical.

20:47.764 --> 20:52.631
For a balanced person there’s no questioning at all.

20:52.832 --> 20:57.556
We have some people like that among us.

20:57.872 --> 21:02.956
They just became and they never questioned.

21:03.347 --> 21:07.677
They just settled down.

21:07.878 --> 21:13.026
They are innocent, they are intelligent,

21:13.227 --> 21:18.277
above all they are spiritual.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.918
But whatever may be the defect in the quality

21:21.119 --> 21:25.159
can be corrected through your Sahasrara.

21:26.316 --> 21:29.611
First of all you have to put down your ego

21:29.812 --> 21:34.570
because if ego is there it presses the Sahasrara.

21:35.058 --> 21:38.623
Also the super-ego must be reduced

21:38.824 --> 21:44.310
because it also presses the Sahasrara and gives pain.

21:46.743 --> 21:50.856
So to keep the Sahasrara in its healthy state

21:51.072 --> 21:58.230
one has to understand that the priorities are to be changed.

21:59.447 --> 22:06.197
Some people take time, so they have to put some deliberate effort.

22:07.149 --> 22:15.971
There are many books, if you read them, they suggest anti-God activities.

22:16.629 --> 22:21.524
An enlightened Sahasrara doesn’t like it,

22:21.725 --> 22:24.855
it closes back.

22:25.056 --> 22:28.032
That’s like a poison.

22:28.240 --> 22:33.214
It doesn’t like any poisonous thought to come in the mind.

22:33.415 --> 22:38.013
If you go about with the poison

22:38.214 --> 22:42.644
then it again closes.

22:43.169 --> 22:50.595
In the same way the people who are hot tempered, very much hot tempered,

22:50.796 --> 22:55.187
and all other problems of the ego,

22:55.388 --> 23:01.036
if they try to suppress the Sahasrara

23:01.237 --> 23:06.055
[then] also the Sahasrara starts closing down.

23:06.486 --> 23:12.039
Those people who have had conditioning from wrong gurus,

23:12.240 --> 23:15.071
and wrong books,

23:15.272 --> 23:18.401
from wrong parents maybe,

23:18.602 --> 23:24.427
from a wrong country,

23:24.628 --> 23:29.322
from a wrong livelihood

23:29.523 --> 23:36.620
also do not allow the Sahasrara to grow in it’s healthy way.

23:37.173 --> 23:42.930
It is only the Sahasrara [that] has to grow, not the Spirit.

23:43.915 --> 23:46.314
The more sensitive the Sahasrara is,

23:46.515 --> 23:53.859
the more it receives the Spiritual qualities of the Spirit.

23:54.130 --> 23:58.776
Actually the peace is felt in the Sahasrara.

23:58.997 --> 24:03.332
The bliss is also felt in the Sahasrara

24:03.533 --> 24:09.471
because that is the brain, and the brain is the epitome of our nervous system,

24:09.672 --> 24:14.857
central nervous system, of consciousness itself.

24:16.610 --> 24:22.830
So only, merely, by opening Sahasrara, the work is not done.

24:23.340 --> 24:28.201
We have to have more and more channels

24:28.402 --> 24:35.026
who will act on these nadis with their different powers,

24:35.227 --> 24:43.097
and who can work it out in a proper systematic manner.

24:43.956 --> 24:52.076
But those people who indulge into wasteful habits after Realisation,

24:52.277 --> 24:57.632
obstruct the flow of the nadis,

24:57.833 --> 25:02.864
and really are very harmful for the Virata.

25:03.626 --> 25:09.040
Such people should really leave Sahaja Yoga and spare [us].

25:10.200 --> 25:12.815
Or such people should be asked to leave

25:13.016 --> 25:16.776
and one should severe relations with such people

25:16.977 --> 25:24.231
who is standing against such a great work of the Divine.

25:25.105 --> 25:28.425
The one who wants to develop on Sahasrara should know

25:28.626 --> 25:33.637
that he should not have bad company,

25:33.838 --> 25:37.110
but always have the company of the other sahaja yogis.

25:39.646 --> 25:43.638
He should not have his own holidays and her own time,

25:43.839 --> 25:46.495
but most of the time he should spend

25:46.696 --> 25:51.146
in the company of other sahaja yogis.

25:51.822 --> 25:57.103
After the Sahasrara, when you are above Sahasrara then you can

25:57.312 --> 26:07.244
see that it is very important that all these nadis must be kept together.

26:08.065 --> 26:17.230
And all the centres and the Deities must be kept awakened and integrated.

26:18.872 --> 26:23.834
This can be done even with a conscious effort

26:24.035 --> 26:30.065
by watching yourself, your thoughts.

26:30.266 --> 26:35.607
You will start seeing your ego and your superego.

26:35.919 --> 26:42.368
You will be able to see how you cheat yourself and you are dishonest to yourself,

26:42.569 --> 26:47.516
how you are convincing yourself that you are very good,

26:48.636 --> 26:53.023
how you are enjoying a ego trip.

26:54.260 --> 27:01.021
Sahaja Yoga is for people who are Spirits

27:01.222 --> 27:05.767
so all other things must drop out.

27:06.147 --> 27:11.171
All misidentifications must be dropped out.

27:11.372 --> 27:14.621
One can do it through conscious mind, as I said,

27:14.822 --> 27:21.663
that you can really correct yourself

27:21.864 --> 27:31.167
because after Realisation whatever you desire becomes a part of the Divine desire

27:31.368 --> 27:37.063
and whatever you do becomes a part of the Divine action.

27:37.618 --> 27:43.409
So one has to remember that with conscious effort

27:43.610 --> 27:51.045
we can find out ourselves and see if we are really honest about it.

27:51.962 --> 27:54.858
If one is honest one can see that collectivity

27:55.059 --> 28:00.790
is the only way to expand your Sahasrara.

28:01.468 --> 28:05.573
For that tolerance is needed,

28:05.774 --> 28:08.872
wisdom is needed,

28:09.073 --> 28:14.326
and a stature is needed of a prophet,

28:14.527 --> 28:18.045
which you are,

28:20.547 --> 28:24.490
and you should talk like a prophet.

28:25.344 --> 28:31.075
Actually, you have to educate yourself.

28:31.276 --> 28:37.771
How does a prophet speaks? How does a prophet speak?

28:38.967 --> 28:45.393
This is not insincere or acting

28:45.594 --> 28:49.687
because now you are awakened.

28:50.440 --> 28:58.075
When you are not awakened then whatever you do like this is artificial.

29:01.583 --> 29:16.129
Sahasrara is the controlling, guiding, evolving force

29:17.452 --> 29:29.695
and so to keep it absolutely ready for growth and expansion

29:29.896 --> 29:37.120
one has to watch one’s own growth.

29:37.321 --> 29:42.380
Never justify your wrongdoings.

29:43.803 --> 29:50.462
If you start justifying, you are actually thinking about that.

29:50.975 --> 29:55.552
We have no time to think about oneself.

29:56.031 --> 30:00.555
You have to think of others

30:00.756 --> 30:04.831
because others are also in your brain;

30:05.032 --> 30:09.164
and when you start thinking of others,

30:09.365 --> 30:15.139
talking to them about their resurrection,

30:15.340 --> 30:25.216
your Sahasrara will definitely increase in its size and in its sensibility.

30:25.846 --> 30:30.448
The sensitivity will also increase,

30:30.649 --> 30:34.437
the depth will also come in.

30:34.638 --> 30:40.674
It is just like a tree, when it grows, its roots spread very strong.

30:43.188 --> 30:48.337
So you have to come out of your shells

30:48.538 --> 30:52.552
and spread your wings.

30:52.753 --> 30:58.364
All small things of mind

30:58.565 --> 31:03.213
must be given up.

31:03.414 --> 31:11.216
You have to live like a very, huge, big personality

31:11.417 --> 31:15.876
which has to give support,

31:16.077 --> 31:19.865
guidance, help

31:20.066 --> 31:25.794
and awakening to thousands.

31:25.995 --> 31:34.207
If this Sahasrara Day in France,

31:34.408 --> 31:40.970
establishes a new dynamism

31:41.171 --> 31:55.196
in this country, I am sure that it will
catch up with the thought of the people.

31:55.397 --> 31:59.808
It will resound into their brains,

32:00.009 --> 32:04.906
their unconscious will transmit it into their being

32:06.890 --> 32:12.455
and they will start thinking afresh.

32:13.135 --> 32:19.158
Now, new breakthroughs will take place,

32:19.359 --> 32:27.970
and people will start going towards Truth logically.

32:28.531 --> 32:32.565
They’ll come to right conclusions.

32:33.262 --> 32:38.827
They’ll drop out all that is useless and wasteful.

32:40.475 --> 32:45.323
Sahasrara is the throne for the Spirit

32:45.524 --> 32:50.945
and the bigger is the king, the bigger is the throne.

32:51.430 --> 32:54.561
The way you treat your Spirit

32:54.762 --> 33:00.376
is expressed through the way you have your Sahasrara.

33:02.379 --> 33:10.296
As it is the seven chakras are seated in the Sahasrara,

33:10.497 --> 33:15.903
you become the master of all these seven chakras,

33:16.727 --> 33:23.259
and that’s how you can do Realisation, you can give Realisation.

33:23.907 --> 33:28.502
And then you can become a subtle being.

33:29.130 --> 33:33.776
Through your conscious effort,

33:33.977 --> 33:40.134
you can enter into the beings of others and raise their Kundalini and correct them.

33:41.208 --> 33:45.434
Enlightenment of the Sahasrara also gives you a new sight

33:45.635 --> 33:52.788
to see all the sukshmas, all the subtle things in the atmosphere.

33:53.490 --> 33:56.016
When you start developing higher and higher,

33:56.217 --> 34:02.362
you can see the vibrations as lights around you.

34:04.285 --> 34:07.655
You may not have any interest in many things

34:07.856 --> 34:15.375
but you’ll be amazed how you become the master of so many things.

34:16.365 --> 34:23.373
As if your brain is materialising whatever you have been desiring.

34:24.484 --> 34:33.655
And this is what is Krishna promised, who is actually the Virata.

34:34.633 --> 34:41.174
So you become the master of your brain

34:41.375 --> 34:46.544
because actually the Spirit is master of the brain.

34:46.745 --> 34:52.714
The more you start bringing Spirit into your attention,

34:52.915 --> 34:58.631
the more the Sahasrara increases in its size.

34:59.269 --> 35:04.443
And the light of that expands

35:04.644 --> 35:09.774
and you become [a] more powerful sahaja yogi.

35:12.115 --> 35:16.250
This is the greatest thing also for God Almighty

35:16.451 --> 35:27.022
to see that this has happened, so that He can,
for the time being, postpone His anger and wrath;

35:27.496 --> 35:36.338
so that He can forgive human beings for their mistakes,

35:36.539 --> 35:41.058
their obstinacy

35:41.259 --> 35:45.442
and childish pranks.

35:46.336 --> 35:50.859
Let the man rise

35:51.060 --> 35:58.101
to see the glory and the greatness of his Father.

35:58.613 --> 36:06.858
Let him have so much of power that he can bear the compassion of God.

36:07.593 --> 36:12.628
Let the Sahasrara develop into such dimensions

36:12.829 --> 36:18.520
that it can execute

36:18.721 --> 36:25.896
the working of the Divine through his own conscious mind.

36:26.657 --> 36:30.635
The Sahasrara has one mantra, that is “Nirmala”,

36:30.836 --> 36:35.733
one must keep it clean, pure and immaculate.

36:36.488 --> 36:41.165
That is what is your job,

36:41.366 --> 36:46.990
is [to] try to keep it pure and clean.

36:48.957 --> 36:57.271
And this will definitely mark another step, another accelerated jump

36:57.472 --> 37:06.187
into a new dimension of many more human beings.

37:07.456 --> 37:11.698
It is a very great pleasure to be in Paris today,

37:11.899 --> 37:17.611
so that the whole world attention should be on Paris,

37:17.812 --> 37:25.635
on France, on this country which is really being cursed;

37:25.836 --> 37:30.771
neglected by all the deities,

37:30.972 --> 37:36.643
because human beings really went very wrong.

37:38.798 --> 37:47.534
Let all the Deities be settled down in this country

37:47.735 --> 37:53.587
because this is the attention,

37:53.788 --> 37:57.399
and attention, whatever attention we pay,

37:57.600 --> 38:03.900
is reported to us through Sahasrara.

38:05.192 --> 38:12.506
So the Sahasrara of France may be opened out,

38:12.707 --> 38:19.419
so the attention of France should be directed towards Spirit,

38:19.620 --> 38:24.153
and  towards the eternal life.

38:24.354 --> 38:28.725
Is [a] very important country,

38:29.870 --> 38:35.882
that’s why I decided to have this day celebrated here.

38:36.897 --> 38:43.676
Now the responsibility on the French sahaja yogis is much greater.

38:44.424 --> 38:48.829
They have to change their methods

38:49.030 --> 38:51.935
and styles.

38:52.136 --> 38:57.145
They should be very mild, gentle

38:57.346 --> 39:02.834
and healthy people

39:03.035 --> 39:09.251
but at the same time they should be very strong sahaja yogis,

39:09.452 --> 39:13.228
so that when others see them

39:13.429 --> 39:17.649
[they] find that superiority in them.

39:19.078 --> 39:23.500
Before the Sahasrara day we have had such a successful session.

39:23.701 --> 39:28.045
I am very happy about you.

39:28.347 --> 39:32.458
May God bless you all.

39:32.659 --> 39:38.192
Now I bless all the other centres,

39:38.393 --> 39:42.600
who have prayed and are praying;

39:42.801 --> 39:48.311
to give them a very developed Sahasrara,

39:48.512 --> 39:51.514
an enlightened one,

39:51.715 --> 39:56.727
that will separate them from their small shells.

39:57.311 --> 40:01.657
Let them expand so much,

40:01.858 --> 40:08.624
that they become one, one with the whole.

40:08.825 --> 40:13.340
May God bless you all.
