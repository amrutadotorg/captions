00:01.484 --> 00:10.079
Today we are celebrating Sahastrara day.

00:10.317 --> 00:20.256
Perhaps we have not realised what a day it must have been.

00:21.751 --> 00:30.463
Without opening the Sahastrara, God Itself was a myth,

00:30.662 --> 00:39.175
religion itself was a myth, and all talk about Divinity was a myth.

00:39.836 --> 00:45.292
People believed in it but it was just a belief.

00:45.512 --> 00:52.539
And the science, as it was put forward,

00:52.671 --> 01:09.758
was about to obliterate all the value system,
all the proof of God Almighty.

01:10.830 --> 01:17.636
If you see in the history, one after another,

01:17.861 --> 01:23.028
when science established itself,

01:23.425 --> 01:30.841
the people who are so-called in charge of
the helm of affairs in religion,

01:31.080 --> 01:37.473
in different religions tried to cope with the findings of science.

01:37.711 --> 01:45.709
They tried to show that:
“All right, if it is said this much – is in the Bible,

01:45.843 --> 01:52.890
and if it is wrong we should correct it.”
Especially Augustine did that.

01:53.367 --> 02:01.960
And it started looking as if it’s all a stupidity this,

02:03.018 --> 02:07.521
these scriptures were just mythical.

02:07.657 --> 02:16.509
At least the Koran itself, though, had lots of things which were

02:17.012 --> 02:23.334
describing the biology of today.

02:25.069 --> 02:32.702
They could not believe that human beings
were specially created by God.

02:32.819 --> 02:37.174
They thought it was a matter of chance that one after another

02:37.267 --> 02:43.635
the animals acquired a situation by which they became human beings.

02:47.828 --> 02:53.903
Thus all the time Divinity was challenged

02:54.180 --> 02:58.888
and there was no way of giving a proof of whatever

02:59.021 --> 03:06.864
is said in the Bible or in the Koran or in the Gita

03:07.182 --> 03:14.062
or in the Upanishadas or in the Torah.

03:14.168 --> 03:19.975
Any one of these things could not be proved

03:20.227 --> 03:23.644
because it was still just a faith.

03:23.830 --> 03:26.981
Very, very few people got their Realisation

03:27.088 --> 03:29.800
and when they talked,  people did not believe them

03:29.825 --> 03:33.769
and thought that they are just trying to say something

03:33.794 --> 03:40.119
which they are using to propound their own theories.

03:40.264 --> 03:47.101
So the whole thing became a kind of dead science.

03:47.247 --> 03:52.564
There was no science of religion.

03:52.589 --> 03:57.347
People started thinking that:
what’s the use of following these ten commandments

03:57.586 --> 04:05.510
or these strict rules of life,
because by following that you gain nothing.

04:05.576 --> 04:08.261
You lose all the fun of the life.

04:08.309 --> 04:12.804
And why think of gaining some punyas also.

04:12.829 --> 04:21.580
And that is how all the time there was
a big derailment of human value system.

04:22.029 --> 04:29.773
Also these organised religions, this monolithic organised religions

04:29.866 --> 04:37.753
started taking to [a] course of gaining power, or gaining money,

04:37.753 --> 04:42.610
because they thought that’s the only way
you can control people and can go on.

04:42.697 --> 04:50.127
They were least bothered as to deliver the goods,
whatever have been described in the Bible.

04:50.234 --> 04:57.509
Bible of course was tampered [with] very much
and has been lot of changes in that.

04:57.622 --> 05:04.257
And a person like Paul, and Peter, who joined together,

05:04.417 --> 05:07.816
tried to spoil most of the Truth.

05:08.268 --> 05:11.111
Though Koran was not so much touched

05:11.217 --> 05:14.722
but still is dealt with more the right side,

05:14.812 --> 05:18.921
with the reproductive system and all those things.

05:19.026 --> 05:22.703
And so many things are still ambiguous.

05:23.574 --> 05:29.363
Now simultaneously two things have happened,
I don’t know if you are aware of it or not.

05:29.444 --> 05:33.990
First thing that has happened is that now we have

05:34.056 --> 05:37.913
a new science of microbiology

05:38.169 --> 05:46.585
in which we have discovered that every cell has got a DNA tape.

05:46.995 --> 05:51.615
Every cell has got a program in it.

05:51.644 --> 05:57.406
As we have in a computer a chip, every cell has got

05:57.671 --> 06:04.234
a tape in it, in a way, that it is programmed.

06:04.512 --> 06:08.121
And according to that program a development takes place.

06:08.146 --> 06:11.018
Now imagine the intricacy of the whole thing!

06:11.188 --> 06:14.973
So many computers are already programmed

06:15.106 --> 06:19.682
and all these cells have these in them.

06:19.815 --> 06:27.319
So a very mysterious sort of a thing
has come up

06:27.344 --> 06:30.731
before the scientists and they cannot explain it.

06:30.831 --> 06:36.011
They cannot explain many things but one of them is this.

06:36.126 --> 06:39.477
Now what Sahaja Yoga has done is that

06:39.546 --> 06:44.062
it has proved that it is the Will of God,

06:44.204 --> 06:47.977
it is the desire of God, the Will of God,

06:48.057 --> 06:53.573
which is doing all the work.

06:54.094 --> 06:55.890
And it has been proved.

06:56.005 --> 07:01.645
All these Chaitanya, Adi Shakti, is nothing but the Will of God.

07:01.928 --> 07:05.181
And Will of God is the One

07:05.340 --> 07:08.909
is working out everything very harmoniously.

07:09.005 --> 07:12.234
I don’t know if some of you must have read my book,

07:12.259 --> 07:17.190
first book, where I have described how this Earth was created.

07:17.367 --> 07:21.405
There was a bang, but it was very harmonious,

07:21.476 --> 07:28.117
and how it developed is through the Will of God.

07:29.285 --> 07:36.745
So everything was done in a way that God’s will was working it out.

07:37.813 --> 07:42.417
Now the Will of God you are feeling it, on your finger tips.

07:42.674 --> 07:48.340
After Realisation, now, you have discovered the the absolute science,

07:48.497 --> 07:54.079
which is the Will of God, which is an absolute science.

07:54.229 --> 07:58.362
You people know that we have cured people through Sahaja Yoga.

07:58.387 --> 08:02.383
You also know giving bandhan, and all that, things work out.

08:02.436 --> 08:05.152
So many things work out automatically

08:05.177 --> 08:08.738
after Realisation that people don’t want to believe.

08:08.844 --> 08:11.095
In the beginning people would not believe

08:11.130 --> 08:15.315
when the scientists told them something, but now it is, you can see,

08:15.340 --> 08:18.705
the science is always in the flux, all the time changing.

08:18.908 --> 08:20.999
One theory is again challenged.

08:21.024 --> 08:22.971
Another theory’s again challenged.

08:23.033 --> 08:30.041
But Sahaja Yoga has exposed you to that Great Truth of science

08:30.147 --> 08:35.197
which cannot be challenged, which is all there.

08:35.364 --> 08:41.052
So anybody who comes out with any new proposal

08:41.238 --> 08:47.291
about defaming God, or saying that there is no God,

08:47.316 --> 08:50.469
we can prove, not [only] that there is God,

08:50.496 --> 08:52.946
but that everything, the creation of this Earth,

08:52.971 --> 08:56.447
the creation of human beings and everything was done

08:56.524 --> 09:02.158
harmoniously by the Will of God.

09:02.538 --> 09:05.745
If Will of God has done everything,

09:05.770 --> 09:08.434
the human beings should not take any credit

09:08.495 --> 09:11.526
for discovering some things which were created by God.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.168
Supposing this carpet is made by somebody

09:14.221 --> 09:17.457
and we start discovering all the colours, what is so great?

09:17.492 --> 09:20.735
It is all there. You cannot create.

09:21.062 --> 09:25.456
So it is not the creation part of it [which is] so much important

09:25.590 --> 09:32.654
but the fashioning of this world, whole thing
was done by the Will of God.

09:33.341 --> 09:39.567
Now if the Will of God is so important,  it has to be proved.

09:40.616 --> 09:45.330
And now through Sahaja Yoga, after the breaking of the Sahastrara,

09:45.582 --> 09:51.444
you have now, for the first time, felt the Will of God,

09:52.166 --> 09:54.181
which is such an important thing,

09:54.206 --> 09:57.942
but for us it is come to us so Sahaj that we don’t understand.

09:57.967 --> 10:01.511
We just give the bandhan and the things work out and

10:01.567 --> 10:06.901
we feel that the things have worked out,

10:06.926 --> 10:11.386
so it is bandhan which has worked out, and

10:15.396 --> 10:18.927
we have managed everything. It’s not so.

10:19.078 --> 10:21.183
It’s much more than that.

10:21.274 --> 10:28.951
We have now become part
and parcel of that Big Computer of that Will of God.

10:28.976 --> 10:38.372
We have become the medium,
or we can say the channels, of that Will of God.

10:38.459 --> 10:46.034
We are connected with that Will of God
which created all this Universe.

10:46.034 --> 10:50.461
So everything we can manage

10:50.573 --> 10:55.834
because we have got the Absolute Science in our hand.

10:56.119 --> 11:03.653
The Absolute Science which will work out
the betterment of the whole world.

11:03.947 --> 11:09.268
We can prove it to the scientist that there is a Will of God

11:09.293 --> 11:12.242
which has done all this creation.

11:12.330 --> 11:16.903
Even evolutionary process is the Will of God.

11:17.245 --> 11:21.974
Without His Will nothing could have happened.

11:21.974 --> 11:30.346
So many people used to say that – not even a blade of grass
moves without the Will of God.

11:30.505 --> 11:32.774
Which is a very true thing.

11:33.321 --> 11:41.922
And you have seen now that –
the Will of God we have got as our own power.

11:42.565 --> 11:47.566
We can use it. So how important it is to be a sahaja yogi.

11:47.591 --> 11:52.442
Perhaps we don’t realise how important it is to be a sahaja yogi.

11:52.467 --> 11:57.551
Sahaja Yoga is not only for saying “Mother, I am full of joy,

11:57.631 --> 12:01.299
I am enjoying myself. I got purified.

12:01.324 --> 12:04.572
Everything is fine“. But for what?

12:04.692 --> 12:07.219
Why did you get all these blessings?

12:07.244 --> 12:13.444
Why you have been cleansed?
So that this knowledge of the Will of God should be apparent in you.

12:13.469 --> 12:16.974
Not only that – should be a part and parcel of you.

12:17.190 --> 12:21.317
So we have to raise our level, we have to come up.

12:21.373 --> 12:26.484
For mediocre and ordinary people
it is really useless to give them Sahaja Yoga

12:26.509 --> 12:28.647
because they are good for nothing.

12:28.801 --> 12:31.789
They are not going to help us in any way

12:31.845 --> 12:35.900
because what is needed is now, today that,

12:35.925 --> 12:41.579
we should have people who can really manifest
and reflect the Will of God.

12:41.675 --> 12:45.576
And for that, you can understand, we have to have very strong people

12:45.601 --> 12:50.742
because this Will has created the whole Universe, the Cosmos,

12:50.767 --> 12:57.321
this Mother Earth. Everything is created by this Will of God.

12:57.416 --> 13:04.465
So now we are exposed to a new dimension

13:04.560 --> 13:09.210
and that dimension is that we are the ones

13:09.272 --> 13:13.922
who are channels of that Will of God.

13:14.293 --> 13:22.418
So then what is our duty and what should we do about it?

13:22.878 --> 13:27.599
As a result of Sahastrara being opened out,

13:27.690 --> 13:31.321
one thing: the illusions have vanished.

13:33.678 --> 13:36.239
What you call [in] Sanskrit is bhranti.

13:36.639 --> 13:38.432
Illusions have vanished.

13:38.487 --> 13:49.299
You should have no illusion as to the existence of God Almighty,

13:50.180 --> 14:00.433
the power of his Will and the truth about Sahaja Yoga.

14:01.830 --> 14:06.676
You should have no doubts at all,
minimum of minimum should be like that.

14:06.934 --> 14:12.570
But while using this Power you should be aware

14:12.792 --> 14:23.334
that this Power is given to you
because you are capable of handling it.

14:24.356 --> 14:27.450
This is the Highest Power you could think of.

14:27.625 --> 14:34.699
Take any governor, take any minister,
anyone, they can be removed tomorrow.

14:34.921 --> 14:37.265
They can become corrupt.

14:37.305 --> 14:45.392
They can become absolutely devoid of
any knowledge of their own powers.

14:45.544 --> 14:49.873
There are many people who just get elected
without knowing what they have to do.

14:50.032 --> 14:52.953
So this is not just a conversion of people,

14:53.128 --> 14:56.223
it’s not only even transformation,

14:56.493 --> 15:00.994
but it is a new fashioning of a new human being

15:01.159 --> 15:10.277
which has come forward and which is capable
of carrying the Will of God further.

15:22.901 --> 15:27.618
So as a result of your Realisation, what you have got?

15:29.612 --> 15:35.003
The first thing that has happened is that your illusions have gone.

15:35.884 --> 15:41.175
You should have no illusions about God Almighty, His Will

15:41.238 --> 15:50.671
and that He is omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient.

15:51.975 --> 15:56.980
All His omnipotence has done this work,

15:57.110 --> 16:00.828
and as a collective consciousness  you should also know that

16:00.845 --> 16:07.281
you are also omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient.

16:07.866 --> 16:12.692
Omniscient is the thing, that He sees everything, knows everything.

16:13.113 --> 16:17.495
Part of it, that Power, is also within you.

16:17.932 --> 16:24.666
So to prove His omnipresence you have to all the time be aware

16:24.833 --> 16:29.079
that you are sahaja yogis. When I find, even now,

16:29.919 --> 16:33.288
sahaja yogis struggling about their wives, their children,

16:33.313 --> 16:35.762
their house, their jobs,

16:35.826 --> 16:38.784
I start wondering what is their level now?

16:38.809 --> 16:47.048
Where are they?
When are they going to take up the role of what they have got?

16:47.283 --> 16:52.221
So the Omnipotent God who is everywhere,

16:52.459 --> 16:58.202
who has done all this, the Will of God that has worked it out,

16:58.480 --> 17:02.677
has to work through you people and you have to be

17:02.702 --> 17:10.014
very strong, very sensible, very wise, also very effective people.

17:11.077 --> 17:15.198
The more effective you become the more energy you will get.

17:15.333 --> 17:20.097
But still I feel that the sahaja yogis are more,

17:20.201 --> 17:23.633
not taking the responsibility of understanding

17:23.721 --> 17:27.422
that they have to represent this God Almighty

17:27.494 --> 17:33.574
who is omnipresent, omniscient,

17:34.281 --> 17:38.059
who knows everything, who sees everything

17:38.084 --> 17:42.767
and who is potent, means Almighty.

17:45.260 --> 17:51.152
If you understand that this is what has happened
after opening the Sahastrara,

17:51.177 --> 17:58.063
that you have now got the power
which has these three qualities in it.

17:58.088 --> 18:05.207
Say now this big thing has to be supported by a strong pillars,

18:05.364 --> 18:09.031
but supposing if they are not strong, it will fall down.

18:09.166 --> 18:12.947
In the same way such a Great Power which has come to you.

18:12.972 --> 18:15.628
For that we don’t need very successful people,

18:15.676 --> 18:18.476
we don’t need people who have a big name

18:18.501 --> 18:20.308
or those who have lots of money,

18:20.356 --> 18:22.613
what we need [is] people of character,

18:22.708 --> 18:26.900
people of understanding,  of wisdom and of strength,

18:26.925 --> 18:30.990
that “Whatever may come I will stand by it,

18:31.015 --> 18:37.711
I will take to it, I’ll cope with it,
I’ll change myself and improve myself“.

18:50.378 --> 18:57.796
So now illusion has been dispelled.
I hope you all have got rid of your illusions.

18:58.236 --> 19:02.359
Also you should have no illusions about yourself.

19:02.862 --> 19:06.234
If you have any illusions you should leave Sahaja Yoga.

19:06.409 --> 19:12.612
But know that you are chosen for this purpose by God’s Will,

19:12.637 --> 19:17.089
that’s why you are here
and you have to take it up, the responsibility

19:17.312 --> 19:21.890
of understanding of this science which is absolute.

19:22.144 --> 19:28.324
And working it out yourself, for yourself as well as for others.

19:28.969 --> 19:32.572
You have felt My love,

19:32.826 --> 19:38.051
but your love must also be felt, because God is love.

19:38.440 --> 19:40.960
So your love must be felt by others.

19:41.080 --> 19:47.857
Other must feel that you are compassionate,
loving, understanding.

19:48.015 --> 19:52.837
That’s all the time this Will of God is flowing through you.

19:53.123 --> 19:56.368
And you have to work it out in such a manner

19:56.400 --> 19:59.335
that people should know that you are a saint,

19:59.360 --> 20:03.229
that this power is flowing through you.

20:05.413 --> 20:08.046
Then the second thing that has happened to you

20:08.094 --> 20:11.713
is that, not the illusion about God and about yourself,

20:12.070 --> 20:16.879
second thing that has happened –
that you have understood the integration,

20:16.995 --> 20:22.949
that in the world there is complete integration which is existing.

20:26.218 --> 20:33.535
Normally if you see the children,
they have their own natural, innate understanding.

20:33.947 --> 20:37.225
They know. If you see, normally, a good child

20:37.297 --> 20:40.217
would always like to share his things,

20:40.504 --> 20:42.960
would like to love another child,

20:43.048 --> 20:46.976
if there’s another little child is there,
would like to protect that child –

20:47.071 --> 20:53.974
naturally! It won’t think whether it has
black hair or red hair or blue hair.

20:55.304 --> 21:01.115
Naturally, innately a child feels that way.

21:01.718 --> 21:07.520
Also if you take another child, supposing, who is a little baby,

21:08.132 --> 21:16.024
they know that one should be careful about the privacy of the body.

21:16.460 --> 21:20.402
Children don’t want to be made nude before others.

21:20.473 --> 21:24.472
No child likes it. Innately they know.

21:24.861 --> 21:27.884
So all these innate qualities are within you.

21:28.159 --> 21:30.225
Children don’t like to steal anything.

21:30.273 --> 21:33.923
They don’t know what is stealing is.
They have no idea of stealing.

21:35.984 --> 21:42.631
I’ve also seen also children that,
if they go to a place which is very beautiful,

21:43.139 --> 21:48.615
in somebody’s house,
they will always try to keep the beauty of that place.

21:48.718 --> 21:52.715
But if it is already shabby they don’t mind.

21:54.776 --> 21:57.968
So innately all these qualities are there.

21:58.048 --> 22:02.309
I think the countries which are supposed to be
underdeveloped have so many of these

22:02.452 --> 22:07.696
qualities within them, which are innately built within us.

22:07.847 --> 22:10.283
Innocence is innately built.

22:10.331 --> 22:13.458
So the Will of God built up,

22:13.660 --> 22:18.614
first and foremost thing, was innocence, the auspiciousness.

22:18.749 --> 22:22.434
The first thing He did was to create Shri Ganesha,

22:22.819 --> 22:26.942
or I would say, She, because the Will of God is Adi Shakti.

22:27.617 --> 22:33.827
And all this was created first of all to make
the whole world very beautiful.

22:35.557 --> 22:38.845
All these innate qualities were also placed within you.

22:38.992 --> 22:41.658
All those Deities were placed within you.

22:41.770 --> 22:47.313
[They] were specially made, human beings,

22:47.567 --> 22:51.032
that they should become saintly people,

22:51.088 --> 22:55.199
that they should have their saintly, innate sense.

22:55.286 --> 22:58.260
But it happened in the countries which developed,

22:58.419 --> 23:05.093
that our brain was bombarded
by all kinds of television, all kind of things,

23:05.283 --> 23:13.549
and we became very, we can say, we became very vulnerable.

23:14.176 --> 23:19.489
We started getting into the ideas of others.

23:19.679 --> 23:22.804
Anybody who is dominating could dominate us.

23:22.883 --> 23:26.097
It’s not only Hitler who dominated people.

23:26.415 --> 23:32.514
We also see today how much we are dominated,
if you really detach yourself from this world.

23:32.960 --> 23:40.374
For example fashions.
Certain things that come up, people cannot give up at any cost.

23:40.852 --> 23:46.858
They cannot take to something that is sensible
because it’s a fashion.

23:47.358 --> 23:52.514
For example nowadays there’s a fashion,
say to have such a small skirt.

23:52.713 --> 23:55.363
You can’t get a long skirt anywhere.

23:55.538 --> 23:59.109
Everybody has to wear that kind of a skirt

23:59.335 --> 24:03.811
otherwise you are not ‘in’,  you are not in the madhouse!

24:04.740 --> 24:10.589
Now this kind of thing is bombarded on us morning till evening

24:10.661 --> 24:15.548
so, first of all, we become slaves of these entrepreneurs.

24:16.518 --> 24:20.514
Whatever they give us now, I was told that in Belgium
you cannot get anything fresh.

24:20.626 --> 24:25.765
You have to take everything from the supermarket,
which is all tinned.

24:26.273 --> 24:31.803
Gradually what is happening to us –
we are getting absolutely artificial.

24:32.038 --> 24:35.715
The food is artificial, the dress is artificial,

24:35.755 --> 24:38.501
our whole attitude becomes artificial

24:38.629 --> 24:42.150
because we are so much bombarded by advertisement,

24:42.206 --> 24:45.746
by all kinds of outside influences

24:45.844 --> 24:47.597
that we just get lost

24:47.708 --> 24:50.759
and we forget what is our innate sense

24:50.793 --> 24:55.224
which is being dominated by all these modern things.

24:55.644 --> 24:59.564
So adding up to the science also

24:59.651 --> 25:06.204
there is  a big progress in another direction,  that we can call,

25:06.506 --> 25:10.016
the money became very important.

25:10.236 --> 25:12.414
Once money becomes important,

25:12.510 --> 25:16.605
then all your entrepreneurs become important,

25:16.675 --> 25:19.868
because they know how to make money and befool you all the time.

25:19.916 --> 25:22.342
Today you have this thing, tomorrow you have that thing.

25:22.367 --> 25:24.858
Today you change this and have this thing.

25:25.879 --> 25:30.168
But those people who are innately built, they do not change!

25:31.217 --> 25:35.590
They have their dresses of the same type, they do not change.

25:35.947 --> 25:39.982
On the contrary they find it very difficult to get out of

25:40.085 --> 25:44.334
their traditional achievements and they don’t want to change themselves.

25:44.604 --> 25:47.869
So for sahaja yogis it is important to see and watch

25:47.957 --> 25:53.744
if they are getting this slavery from
the entrepreneurs in modern times.

25:54.200 --> 26:01.487
Then, the thoughts.
So many books we read, which gives you thoughts,

26:01.733 --> 26:09.527
which are some mad rambling,
I would say, of some madman, like Freud.

26:10.011 --> 26:13.167
How could Freud influence the West?

26:13.366 --> 26:20.307
Because you have lost your innate sense and you accepted.

26:22.100 --> 26:28.884
You accepted that and that’s how Freud became your,
sort of a, Jesus Christ.

26:29.373 --> 26:31.917
He became the most important thing.

26:31.973 --> 26:39.577
Sex became the most important thing. I mean it’s so simple.

26:39.676 --> 26:42.588
With little common sense you can understand

26:42.718 --> 26:50.032
that, at every moment, we are put into this kind of a

26:56.908 --> 27:02.632
of a domination by these few

27:02.816 --> 27:07.109
domineering people who have certain ideas,
and they put forward.

27:07.435 --> 27:12.468
Anybody puts any idea. For example,
Sade (the Marquis de Sade) or Sartre or anyone.

27:12.865 --> 27:16.654
That idea starts becoming “Oh he said it“.
Who is he?

27:16.726 --> 27:21.054
What is his life?
Just see for yourself what sort of a man he is.

27:21.112 --> 27:25.300
With little common sense.
But with your will that you have now,

27:25.555 --> 27:29.697
Will of God, which has fashioned the whole world,
which has fashioned you.

27:29.722 --> 27:34.834
Every cell within you has been fashioned by God Almighty

27:34.953 --> 27:40.003
and what you are doing is to play
into the hands of these entrepreneurs.

27:40.391 --> 27:47.321
They have realised that these vulnerable people are very good for

27:47.726 --> 27:57.814
having as their disciples,  I should say,
to make money, to befool them.

27:58.331 --> 28:03.977
Now on this side, you have such a Great Power,

28:05.080 --> 28:08.035
you are chosen for a, such a great thing,

28:08.146 --> 28:14.128
and on the other side you have this kind of slavery.

28:17.119 --> 28:21.734
So try to understand that your innate qualities were lost.

28:21.846 --> 28:26.776
But luckily, by the Kundalini awakening
and by the breaking of the Sahastrara,

28:26.903 --> 28:31.004
all these innate qualities which looked like lost:

28:31.051 --> 28:34.589
like your innocence, like your creativity,

28:34.812 --> 28:42.111
like your religion within, like your compassion

28:42.927 --> 28:52.823
and love for the humanity ,
like your power of judgment, wisdom.

28:53.125 --> 28:57.676
All these great qualities which we thought were lost were nothing

28:57.802 --> 29:01.295
but they were in a dormant state.

29:01.433 --> 29:04.374
They all got awakened one by one.

29:04.423 --> 29:07.264
I don’t have to tell you “Don’t drink this!

29:07.423 --> 29:10.279
Don’t eat this! Don’t do that!”.

29:10.351 --> 29:14.617
You yourself realise that this is wrong.

29:15.140 --> 29:18.327
You yourself know what is good for you.

29:18.423 --> 29:21.827
And still if you want to do wrong you can go ahead.

29:22.367 --> 29:26.549
But already there is a light within you to see for yourself

29:26.621 --> 29:28.613
what is good and what is bad.

29:28.638 --> 29:33.111
It has come because of this Sahastrara being opened out

29:33.145 --> 29:36.150
to this – a new dimension of new knowledge.

29:36.222 --> 29:39.684
And this is not new, it is all innately built within you.

29:39.709 --> 29:45.606
Now all those innate qualities are manifesting
and you are enjoying them.

29:47.827 --> 29:52.242
So now you have to get out of your petty ideas and petty things.

29:52.966 --> 29:55.608
People are reporting to Me something very funny –

29:55.633 --> 29:57.898
I can’t believe sahaja yogis can do like that –

29:57.923 --> 30:00.982
that they run away with the plates that I have bought,

30:01.030 --> 30:04.683
or they run away with the cups, they throw things here and there,

30:04.754 --> 30:07.091
all over the places they are throwing things.

30:07.163 --> 30:09.678
How can you behave like this?

30:10.742 --> 30:14.220
I mean this is so stupid and so insipid.

30:14.332 --> 30:18.540
If you do not have a proper discipline of life yourself,

30:18.675 --> 30:22.274
you cannot carry the Will of God, you cannot.

30:22.346 --> 30:27.008
But I’m not going to tell you “Do this or do that!”

30:27.135 --> 30:30.009
I respect your freedom

30:31.041 --> 30:37.096
and I just want that your own Kundalini should awaken
that wisdom in you,

30:37.263 --> 30:40.372
that greatness in you, that glory in you

30:40.459 --> 30:44.859
and you start understanding what is our innate quality.

30:45.978 --> 30:48.097
So it will purify you.

30:48.208 --> 30:50.660
Once you are purified completely, like

30:50.726 --> 30:53.484
you see, if you have some gold which is not pure

30:53.516 --> 30:58.451
you put it in the fire,  the gold is separated.

30:58.476 --> 31:03.340
In the same way, the fire of Kundalini cleanses you completely,

31:03.436 --> 31:05.818
makes you absolutely clean,

31:05.863 --> 31:13.483
and you start seeing your own glory,
your own nature, your own greatness.

31:13.666 --> 31:19.497
So the integration part comes to you easily.
You start integrating.

31:20.061 --> 31:27.995
First of all, we used to have sahaja yogis, say from,

31:28.049 --> 31:32.538
some from England, some from Spain, some from here.

31:32.550 --> 31:36.435
They would always have different groups,
they would never sit together.

31:36.648 --> 31:39.149
You could make out this is English sitting here,

31:39.244 --> 31:44.095
they are sitting here, they are sitting here,
and they would form a group.

31:44.349 --> 31:51.261
But now it’s not so. Now I find they all are becoming integrated.

31:51.531 --> 31:59.487
The integration of human beings is
the most important thing for Sahaja Yoga.

32:00.773 --> 32:06.100
That comes by understanding, not by your intelligence,

32:06.227 --> 32:12.384
but by innate understanding that –
all human beings are made by God,

32:12.487 --> 32:18.153
by His will, and we have no right to despise anyone.

32:19.069 --> 32:25.120
The second integration that has come within you is that all religions,

32:25.517 --> 32:32.716
all religions, are born on the same tree of spiritual life.

32:34.510 --> 32:40.552
That all religions are to be worshipped, all incarnations,

32:40.648 --> 32:47.864
all prophets, all scriptures are to be worshipped.

32:48.023 --> 32:53.998
There are defects, there are problems with
those scriptures which can be corrected.

32:54.720 --> 33:00.040
So gradually you start entering into the subtler side of Divinity,

33:00.119 --> 33:04.457
to understand that all these people have worked hard

33:04.595 --> 33:07.652
to create, today, the atmosphere for Sahaja Yoga,

33:07.740 --> 33:12.940
and no religion is to be despised,
and no religion is to be attacked,

33:13.067 --> 33:19.880
which is a very, very, absolutely a unreal thing

33:20.047 --> 33:26.102
and you are working out a very unreal theory

33:26.174 --> 33:30.166
which doesn’t exist in the Divine plan.

33:30.284 --> 33:34.122
So this is how we finish all fundamentalism.

33:34.512 --> 33:37.448
Fundamentalists are the ones who believed that

33:37.535 --> 33:40.558
this is written in this book, this is written in this book,

33:40.644 --> 33:45.110
and that we, because we read this book, we are something better.

33:45.214 --> 33:48.484
Anybody can read any book, what is so great?

33:48.880 --> 33:52.959
Same, I would say, in Sahaja Yoga people
should not become fundamentalist.

33:53.023 --> 33:54.546
Be very careful!

33:54.689 --> 33:57.437
Because that’s what you are – born like that, I mean,

33:57.565 --> 34:00.080
I don’t know, it’s not your innate quality  but

34:00.159 --> 34:04.076
the way you are made that way,
you have fashioned yourself that way,

34:04.283 --> 34:08.725
that you start also making Sahaja Yoga sometimes a fundamental.

34:08.773 --> 34:10.717
“Mother said so.”

34:10.820 --> 34:13.399
Do not use Me anywhere!

34:13.495 --> 34:17.622
“Mother said so!” Is a way you want to dominate others.

34:18.926 --> 34:24.243
You yourself say because now you have a right,
you have an individuality in Sahaja Yoga.

34:24.425 --> 34:27.421
You can say what you have to say yourself,

34:27.604 --> 34:30.650
but don’t say that “Mother has said it!”

34:30.769 --> 34:34.413
Because anybody can start it, like that: “Christ said it!”.

34:34.509 --> 34:40.243
A clergyman or, a say, pope can stand up on his

34:40.497 --> 34:45.646
own platform  and say that Christ has said it.

34:46.879 --> 34:50.684
They can just arbitrarily use all these things.

34:50.825 --> 34:55.021
So nobody has business to use Me arbitrarily.

34:55.125 --> 34:57.703
Whatever you have to say you say yourself.

34:57.751 --> 35:01.418
But don’t ever quote Me as that: “Mother has said it,”

35:01.521 --> 35:05.841
or, “In this book such and such is written,
so this is the line, that is important.

35:05.941 --> 35:10.370
” You are not bound by any line, by whatever I say.

35:10.434 --> 35:15.778
It is you who has to stand up and see for yourself
what you have to say,

35:15.985 --> 35:19.327
because you have to use now your will

35:20.185 --> 35:28.824
and for that you have to develop yourself to have Pure Will,
the Pure Desire of God Almighty.

35:29.705 --> 35:33.824
The integration not only outward, but inward.

35:33.904 --> 35:40.097
Like first of all, whatever we did, our mind used to say one thing,

35:40.200 --> 35:45.032
our heart used to say another thing,
our brain used to say another thing.

35:45.477 --> 35:51.429
Now what has happened that all these 3 things have become one.

35:51.701 --> 35:58.437
So, whatever your brain says is absolutely acceptable to your heart,

35:58.755 --> 36:01.540
absolutely acceptable to your attention.

36:02.263 --> 36:05.552
So you yourself, you have become now integrated.

36:05.912 --> 36:09.211
Many people write “Mother I want to do it, but I can’t do it,”

36:09.338 --> 36:13.483
“Mother it was my desire to do it, but I can’t do it.” Not now.

36:13.642 --> 36:20.474
Now you are completely integrated
and you can easily do the whole thing very well.

36:21.093 --> 36:29.246
If you want to examine yourself,
you should try to find out “Am I integrated or not?

36:29.428 --> 36:32.888
Whatever I’m doing, am I doing with my full heart or not,

36:32.982 --> 36:35.197
with my full attention or not?”

36:35.292 --> 36:40.530
I’ve seen that you do with full heart and full intelligence

36:40.626 --> 36:43.244
but full attention is not there.

36:43.776 --> 36:48.753
Still the attention, which is the first thing
that was enlightened, is not fully used.

36:49.023 --> 36:57.009
So the whole attention should be absolutely there,

36:57.231 --> 37:01.794
that, “I have to do this thing with full attention.”

37:02.279 --> 37:06.972
Otherwise, the integration is not complete, integration is partial.

37:07.361 --> 37:12.697
So these three things have to be completely integrated.

37:20.437 --> 37:25.116
So the integration of all the chakras comes in.

37:25.204 --> 37:28.592
Like whatever you do, has to be auspicious.

37:29.434 --> 37:33.497
Whatever you do has to be with full attention.

37:34.517 --> 37:38.768
Whatever you do has to be absolutely religious.

37:40.038 --> 37:45.383
So like that, all these centres are being absolutely,

37:45.423 --> 37:50.804
one integrated power that you have.

37:51.035 --> 37:53.296
So the whole life should be integrated.

37:53.351 --> 37:56.219
Now, say somebody’s husband is not that level

37:56.267 --> 38:00.655
or somebody’s wife is not of that level,  you shouldn’t bother.

38:00.806 --> 38:06.501
You should just bother about yourself.
Don’t expect anything from anybody else.

38:06.691 --> 38:11.537
It is your duty which is important.
You have to fulfill your duty

38:11.664 --> 38:14.615
and you have to work it out yourself.

38:14.695 --> 38:20.522
Unless and until you understand that it is your individual being

38:21.006 --> 38:25.805
which has achieved it,
and it’s the individual being which has to realise it,

38:25.932 --> 38:31.622
is the individual being that has to become one,
integrated with the rest of them.

38:31.891 --> 38:35.380
If you start putting things, like many a times I’ve seen

38:35.436 --> 38:38.379
[that] if I say something people start thinking

38:38.427 --> 38:42.527
that I am saying for somebody else, they never take it for themselves.

38:44.082 --> 38:49.587
So,not we have to see what is my gain: “I’ve got financial gain" say

38:49.658 --> 38:55.288
“I’ve got physical gains,
I’ve got mental gains, I’ve got joy, happiness”

38:55.313 --> 38:58.639
that’s not the only thing.

39:00.734 --> 39:03.575
That should not be the only criteria.

39:03.718 --> 39:08.982
But what you should have is the understanding

39:09.578 --> 39:16.334
of your own personality which is being specially fashioned

39:16.508 --> 39:23.716
[through] many, many lives for you
to come in this life to get your Realisation,

39:24.041 --> 39:29.809
to do the further work of Will of God.

39:32.746 --> 39:38.228
Every moment when you see a miracle taking place, you do realise

39:38.308 --> 39:40.652
that it’s all done by Paramchaitanya.

39:40.708 --> 39:44.851
But what is Paramchaitanya – is the will of Adi Shakti.

39:45.176 --> 39:48.422
And what is Adi Shakti – is the Will of God.

39:49.815 --> 39:57.343
So, is all, whatever is done, is all ‘fixed entities’,
we can call them,

39:57.536 --> 40:05.261
or these vibrations are like, we can say, DNA tapes.

40:05.675 --> 40:10.309
They all know how they have to fashion you.

40:10.946 --> 40:13.834
See, today it’s very sunny.

40:13.874 --> 40:17.231
Everybody is surprised how can they have.

40:17.262 --> 40:19.878
So many things happen like this.

40:19.934 --> 40:23.108
The other day, we had havan, it was absolutely sunny.

40:23.327 --> 40:25.969
So the whole Cosmos is working for you.

40:26.057 --> 40:29.523
You are on the stage now and you have to see to it,

40:29.611 --> 40:33.015
but if you don’t have faith in yourself,

40:33.356 --> 40:40.295
if you are not confident as to what you are, how can you help?

40:41.781 --> 40:48.954
How can you work out yourself
and work out all the problems of the world,

40:49.058 --> 40:51.586
which are created only by human beings?

40:51.674 --> 40:59.029
So we have to absolutely overthrow all these dominations on us.

40:59.346 --> 41:03.661
First from science. We can prove everything that Sahaja Yoga,

41:03.723 --> 41:07.301
whatever it has said about science, has been proved.

41:07.484 --> 41:12.608
So, we can throw science which is just always,

41:12.669 --> 41:15.625
all the time, in the flux, it’s changing all the time.

41:15.704 --> 41:18.391
Then the so-called religions that we have.

41:18.479 --> 41:23.362
So-called religions because people who have been Catholics,

41:23.387 --> 41:28.082
who have been Protestants, who have been Hindus
or Muslims, or this and that,

41:28.288 --> 41:31.526
they all have got that thing on their heads.

41:31.733 --> 41:34.066
And this has to be thrown away.

41:34.320 --> 41:37.332
We have to become a new personality.

41:37.539 --> 41:43.031
After Realisation, as I said,
you become like a lotuses is from the mud.

41:44.459 --> 41:47.100
So now you have become lotuses and the lotuses

41:47.125 --> 41:50.354
have to throw away all this dead mud,

41:50.405 --> 41:53.349
otherwise fragrance won’t be there.

41:53.629 --> 41:55.414
That, one has to achieve:

41:55.525 --> 42:01.727
is to throw away all these shackles
which are, which are killing you,

42:08.196 --> 42:14.692
which are of no use, but a burden.

42:15.454 --> 42:18.287
And beautiful lotuses as you are

42:18.442 --> 42:24.095
you have to understand that
the whole fashioning has been done so carefully,

42:24.158 --> 42:30.271
with such sweetness, with such delicacy.

42:32.146 --> 42:36.008
So first of all we must have respect for ourselves,

42:36.477 --> 42:40.415
we must have affection and love for others

42:41.304 --> 42:46.804
and we must have respect, means we must have discipline.

42:47.789 --> 42:49.812
We have to have the discipline

42:50.616 --> 42:54.811
because if you respect yourself you’ll definitely discipline yourself

42:54.931 --> 42:56.883
and you’ll make it available.

42:58.362 --> 43:04.806
Now as you can realise, that from My life itself,

43:04.965 --> 43:10.715
that I work very hard, travel a lot,
much more than any one of you can do.

43:10.889 --> 43:19.028
Because I have the will that – I have to bring this world

43:19.710 --> 43:24.732
to that state of enjoyment, to that state of happiness,

43:25.011 --> 43:29.132
to that state of Divinity, where they realise

43:29.306 --> 43:35.083
what is their glory, what is the glory of their Father.

43:35.796 --> 43:39.756
So I work very hard and I never even think

43:39.860 --> 43:42.135
that something will go wrong with Me,

43:42.191 --> 43:44.659
or “This will happen”,  “What will happen?”

43:44.775 --> 43:47.662
I never have bothered you about My family life,

43:47.741 --> 43:50.395
about My children, about anyone.

43:50.431 --> 43:54.196
Whatever problems I had, I am dealing with them Myself.

43:54.403 --> 43:57.664
But here I get such big, big letters from sahaja yogis,

43:57.891 --> 44:02.779
writing about their daughter, their son, this thing, that thing.

44:02.962 --> 44:07.870
Another thing is attachment to family is
the biggest burden on your heads

44:07.961 --> 44:11.886
and all the time you are worried about your children,

44:11.911 --> 44:14.606
you are worried about this, you are worried about that.

44:14.749 --> 44:16.684
That’s not your responsibility.

44:18.237 --> 44:19.792
Please try to understand.

44:19.999 --> 44:23.419
That’s the responsibility of God Almighty.

44:23.924 --> 44:26.850
You can’t do better than Him can you?

44:27.426 --> 44:31.373
But when you try to take the responsibility
He says “All right, look after!”

44:31.398 --> 44:33.547
and the problems start.

44:35.659 --> 44:40.346
‘Detachment’ is the word one should understand in a proper sense.

44:40.957 --> 44:43.605
When I ask people why do you throw things here and there, say

44:43.629 --> 44:45.930
“We are detached!”- wonderful way!

44:47.183 --> 44:50.451
And what about your children? You cling on to them.

44:50.946 --> 44:53.883
What about your own things? You cling on to them.

44:53.917 --> 44:56.976
For a small little thing, they’ll bother My head.

44:57.389 --> 45:01.923
And, when it belongs to Me or to Sahaja Yoga,

45:02.018 --> 45:05.173
then they’ll have a very nice time with it –

45:05.278 --> 45:07.493
and throw it away,  wherever they feel like.

45:07.518 --> 45:10.140
I mean this kind of irresponsibility!

45:10.887 --> 45:13.373
How can you call them divine?

45:13.775 --> 45:16.021
How can they be saintly people?

45:16.251 --> 45:21.678
Saintly people not only are responsible for themselves,
but for everyone.

45:23.163 --> 45:29.532
Very slowly, smoothly, sweetly, with great affection,

45:29.821 --> 45:32.133
I have brought you to this level.

45:32.523 --> 45:35.903
I didn’t ask you to go to Himalayas or stand on your heads

45:36.002 --> 45:39.846
or to donate all your properties to Me.
Nothing of the kind.

45:41.565 --> 45:45.591
We have managed it in a very, very beautiful manner.

45:46.012 --> 45:48.712
Now further, when you have to go further,

45:49.674 --> 45:53.457
then you have to understand that your duties

45:53.505 --> 45:56.594
are to be fulfilled by you and by nobody else.

45:57.056 --> 46:02.045
But these duties are done by you,

46:02.102 --> 46:08.321
are towards your family, towards your house,
towards this, towards that.

46:09.567 --> 46:12.487
No duties towards Sahaja Yoga.

46:16.098 --> 46:21.099
So when you were, before Sahaja Yoga,
you were not attached to anyone,

46:21.273 --> 46:24.724
in the sense – you were only attached to yourself, self-centered.

46:24.749 --> 46:27.470
Now you have widened yourself a little more,

46:27.495 --> 46:30.633
that now you are attached to your wife, to your children.

46:30.872 --> 46:33.459
But that’s just the same.

46:33.606 --> 46:39.503
That is also selfish, because they are your children, you think.

46:39.641 --> 46:44.551
They are not your children, they are the children of God.

46:45.072 --> 46:49.026
I hope all of you are intelligent enough to understand

46:49.424 --> 46:53.891
your responsibility and work it out.

46:55.180 --> 46:58.711
This is a very important thing that has happened to you

46:58.943 --> 47:00.998
that Sahastrara has opened.

47:01.104 --> 47:04.674
Now you can prove the existence of God,

47:04.714 --> 47:08.428
His Will, everything, to the whole world.

47:08.787 --> 47:11.715
Nobody can challenge Sahaja Yoga.

47:11.774 --> 47:15.630
Those scientist who will challenge can be told.

47:15.907 --> 47:20.644
Anybody, whether you’re a scientist, economist, politician, anything,

47:21.063 --> 47:26.216
everything can be explained in the light of Sahaja Yoga

47:26.328 --> 47:30.616
and can be proved that there’s only one politics –that is of God,

47:30.727 --> 47:33.305
one economics – that is of God,

47:33.353 --> 47:39.441
and there is only one religion –
that is of God,  is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

47:40.188 --> 47:41.957
It can be proved,

47:42.317 --> 47:47.276
there’s nothing to be afraid of or to worry about.

47:47.581 --> 47:50.541
This all can be proved to the scientist and

47:50.565 --> 47:56.040
to the other intellectuals and to some few people

47:56.215 --> 47:57.587
if they want to listen to us.

47:57.612 --> 48:00.120
If they don’t want to listen to us, forget it.

48:00.199 --> 48:02.852
Because we are so powerful, why should you worry about them?

48:02.920 --> 48:04.903
But, if they are willing to listen to us,

48:04.946 --> 48:10.495
then is better that we tell them
“Now we have discovered this Great Power”,

48:10.781 --> 48:13.172
and if it works out,

48:13.268 --> 48:15.910
if this Great Power works out

48:16.077 --> 48:20.791
then only we can really fashion the whole world in a new way.

48:20.869 --> 48:24.495
I have great hopes from you people,

48:24.792 --> 48:27.617
but the seriousness with which you should take Sahaja Yoga,

48:27.657 --> 48:31.632
for example even meditation, people don’t do.

48:32.919 --> 48:36.724
Simple thing like meditation,
you people don’t do,  I can’t understand.

48:36.812 --> 48:39.200
How will you grow without meditation?

48:39.716 --> 48:45.361
Unless and until you become thoughtlessly aware you cannot grow.

48:45.609 --> 48:50.627
So you have to, you have to at least meditate morning, evening.

48:50.766 --> 48:54.761
There are many people who are not even collective by temperament.

48:54.820 --> 48:58.869
If they are staying in an ashram
they just think that ashram life is no good.

48:58.894 --> 49:01.750
Such people should really get out of Sahaja Yoga,

49:02.558 --> 49:05.739
because they have not yet understood what this Sahaja Yoga is.

49:06.009 --> 49:08.390
Without collectivity how will you grow?

49:09.039 --> 49:11.118
How will you assemble your power? You see?

49:11.224 --> 49:15.685
You know very well that in a sangha, in a group,

49:15.860 --> 49:20.391
in combining together only, you can be strong.

49:20.657 --> 49:24.301
Is a fact that if you have one stick you can break it,

49:24.357 --> 49:28.023
but if you put many sticks together you cannot break it.

49:28.145 --> 49:32.966
But there are still people
I know who are still not so much in collectivity.

49:33.167 --> 49:37.882
Shows how poor they are in their understanding of their own Self,

49:38.054 --> 49:39.811
and they are telling Me that “Mother,

49:39.843 --> 49:44.049
we don’t want to stay in the Ashram  now anywhere more.”

49:44.115 --> 49:46.678
So they should get out of Sahaja Yoga.

49:47.784 --> 49:50.203
Without the collectivity, you cannot grow.

49:50.219 --> 49:53.568
Without the discipline of Sahaja Yoga, you cannot grow.

49:53.922 --> 49:59.008
It’s better to have ten people of good quality
than to have thousand useless people.

49:59.622 --> 50:01.772
That’s what is the Will of God.

50:01.963 --> 50:05.938
So now, as you are today here,  so many people,

50:05.970 --> 50:09.510
I am really enamoured  to see so many people are there.

50:09.748 --> 50:14.495
And we have done so much of our growth

50:14.520 --> 50:19.222
and grown out of all those
nonsensical things that we were following.

50:19.746 --> 50:24.361
But today we have to take a vow

50:24.735 --> 50:31.051
that –  “I’ll now fashion my life according to the Will of God.

50:31.077 --> 50:34.216
Absolutely. And dedicate myself to that.”

50:34.241 --> 50:38.265
No family, no other considerations.

50:38.298 --> 50:41.305
Just forget it! Nothing so important.

50:41.610 --> 50:44.732
Everything can be looked after by Will of God.

50:44.979 --> 50:48.415
So if you just try to follow the Will of God,

50:48.448 --> 50:50.795
your children will be looked after,

50:50.819 --> 50:55.303
everything will be looked after,
you don’t have to worry for anything.

50:55.759 --> 50:57.203
And that works.

50:57.290 --> 51:00.679
Just try to understand that you have problems

51:00.704 --> 51:03.666
because you don’t want to give those problems to God,

51:03.691 --> 51:06.503
you want to keep it to themselves, that’s why you have problems.

51:06.560 --> 51:08.630
If you decide that “No,

51:09.072 --> 51:14.613
I just want to give these problems to the God’s will,” Finished!

51:15.743 --> 51:20.382
Also there are some who want to say that “We are not so capable

51:20.462 --> 51:25.771
Mother, we can’t do it.”
Saying like this also is stupid.

51:27.367 --> 51:31.284
You test yourself, you see for yourself.

51:32.134 --> 51:36.197
So first of all, one has to understand why do we say such a thing?

51:36.777 --> 51:39.936
Maybe that we are very money-oriented,

51:40.148 --> 51:44.263
that we want to have money to ourselves, or something like that.

51:44.474 --> 51:48.672
Or some people are there who talk of business also in Sahaja Yoga.

51:48.946 --> 51:52.353
There must be something like a money orientation,

51:52.519 --> 51:54.953
or some sort of a material attachment

51:55.001 --> 51:59.008
that they say that ‘We are not capable,
we cannot change.”

51:59.449 --> 52:03.189
The second could be this mamatwa as they call it.

52:03.237 --> 52:08.186
The attachment to your family, children, this, that.

52:08.615 --> 52:11.273
Or, ‘This is mine, this is mine,this is mine.”

52:11.556 --> 52:13.989
This could be the second reason

52:14.132 --> 52:18.033
that you think that you are not bold enough

52:18.058 --> 52:22.567
or you are not strong enough to do Sahaja Yoga.

52:22.751 --> 52:28.796
Thirdly could be that you are still playing with your old habits

52:29.288 --> 52:34.248
and that you are enjoying your life without virtues.

52:35.174 --> 52:37.339
There can be some reason like that.

52:37.395 --> 52:41.251
So just try to locate, “Why am I behaving like this?

52:41.356 --> 52:46.380
Why am I not getting into the same

52:46.476 --> 52:53.225
beautiful path of my ascent as everybody has got it.”

52:53.868 --> 52:58.483
If we introspect, you’ll find out that
"There’s something wrong with me

52:58.930 --> 53:01.871
that I think I am not capable of doing.”

53:01.967 --> 53:05.125
You are capable of doing everything!

53:05.578 --> 53:08.995
You just try this and enjoy it.

53:10.290 --> 53:18.290
So, most important thing now [that]
remains is that you should become a

53:19.163 --> 53:24.245
proper, strong, compassionate vehicle of God’s Will.

53:24.785 --> 53:28.658
So. Then, what is most important of course,

53:28.689 --> 53:32.904
I agree, that you do My puja,
because that helps you a lot, no doubt.

53:32.929 --> 53:35.837
But other things are not important.

53:38.203 --> 53:42.488
So many other things you people tell Me is not of importance.

53:43.574 --> 53:48.803
Main thing is that you should all ascend higher and higher

53:49.355 --> 53:55.266
and compete with each other in getting into higher situation.

53:55.845 --> 54:01.624
As it is, I think in such a short time
we have achieved a lot, no doubt,

54:01.703 --> 54:05.526
but still we have to speed up and work it out.

54:05.736 --> 54:11.070
I am sure that this new science,
or we can say, the, which is the

54:11.676 --> 54:15.457
absolute science will one day outshadow

54:15.592 --> 54:19.184
the other science, and tell people that: this is what it is.

54:19.209 --> 54:22.082
It is in your hands, you work it out.

54:22.914 --> 54:27.046
So today is the day we are celebrate by which

54:27.102 --> 54:31.839
we have opened absolutely a new dimension,

54:33.645 --> 54:41.334
absolutely a venue of great Divinity,

54:41.485 --> 54:44.975
of the proofs of Divine.

54:45.055 --> 54:54.450
And this is something so great that we can really finish

54:54.475 --> 54:59.802
all the illusions they have about themselves, about their ego.

54:59.929 --> 55:01.772
We can manage them.

55:01.852 --> 55:04.971
That power you all have.

55:06.262 --> 55:11.230
May God Bless You.
