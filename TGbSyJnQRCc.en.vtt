00:07.419 --> 00:12.748
So now you have to understand that raise
your Kundalini as many times as you can.

00:12.949 --> 00:16.119
Try to put attention to your Kundalini
all the time.

00:16.320 --> 00:20.161
See where is the problem is. Get it
cleared out, absolutely cleared out.

00:20.362 --> 00:24.619
Find out where is the problem is and raise
your Kundalini many a times

00:24.820 --> 00:30.230
and see that you are flowing all right
on your fontanel bone area,

00:30.431 --> 00:32.880
so that your heart expands.

00:33.081 --> 00:36.350
It’s a mechanical process in a way,
you can say.

00:36.551 --> 00:38.712
But even that you people don’t do.

00:38.913 --> 00:41.350
If you had done that, your heart would
have increased.

00:41.551 --> 00:47.499
And you yourself will say, ‘Mother,
my heart has become large like Asia.’

00:47.700 --> 00:52.580
And then you see the miracle of the heart,
how it emits vibrations

00:52.781 --> 00:56.524
by which you become such compassionate,
such dynamic,

00:56.725 --> 01:01.456
beautiful people and so sincere
to Sahaja Yoga.

01:02.820 --> 01:06.599
I would request you to open your heart
today for this puja.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.767
You have been very jubilant and happy.

01:08.968 --> 01:12.355
And must be your heart must have opened
because I’ve seen Sahaja Yogis

01:12.556 --> 01:17.761
have a very large heart for Me, but
for themselves they don’t have.

01:17.962 --> 01:22.743
They’ll do everything for Me, but nothing
for themselves.

01:22.944 --> 01:26.528
They’ll work morning till evening
to decorate the hall, to do everything.

01:26.734 --> 01:30.413
They must have sent all these flowers
to Me from I don’t know where.

01:30.614 --> 01:35.483
But if I tell them, ‘You meditate for
yourself’, that they will not do.

01:36.358 --> 01:40.464
Or ‘You achieve this for yourself’,
that they will not do.

01:40.959 --> 01:43.217
This is the situation.

01:43.418 --> 01:47.944
So, instead of wasting all your energy
for decorating all these things,

01:48.145 --> 01:51.058
you should decorate yourself
within yourself.

01:51.259 --> 01:54.197
With sincerity, with nice thoughts
about yourself

01:54.398 --> 01:58.677
that you are capable, absolutely capable
people

01:58.878 --> 02:04.365
and you can use your imagination,

02:04.566 --> 02:09.450
your intelligence, rationality, whatever
you think you have,

02:09.651 --> 02:18.300
to find the way, to find the way, again
I say, to keep your heart large.

02:19.895 --> 02:24.952
And this is the message for today’s
birthday all over the world

02:25.153 --> 02:32.134
because I felt that the whole world was
today like a big heart pulsating.

02:32.335 --> 02:37.131
I received the last phone and came here.

02:41.077 --> 02:43.998
From all over the phones coming,

02:44.199 --> 02:48.127
flowers are showering, the beautiful nice
things they are saying.

02:48.328 --> 02:53.313
Everything is there. When I am just
drenched into it,

02:53.514 --> 02:58.150
just drenched, it was too much for Me.
Such sweet, sweet things for the children,

02:58.351 --> 03:00.902
from the children, such things from
the ladies,

03:01.103 --> 03:05.924
some very, very nice from the men
and it was amazing

03:06.125 --> 03:12.670
how these people are bubbling with
enjoyment that today is My birthday.

03:14.080 --> 03:20.102
In the same way, please consider that
every day is your birthday,

03:20.303 --> 03:23.346
that you have to raise your Kundalini
all the time

03:23.547 --> 03:27.898
and keep the standard of your Kundalini
higher and higher.

03:28.099 --> 03:32.372
The more you open out, the more threads
of Kundalini will come up

03:32.573 --> 03:37.202
and the more your heart will open out

03:37.403 --> 03:40.858
and it will be awakened, it will become
more powerful.

03:41.059 --> 03:44.274
And with an open, big heart and a powerful
heart,

03:44.475 --> 03:49.686
you can dominate your brain, which is
giving you all these funny ideas.

03:49.983 --> 03:53.921
I hope this will happen this year here

03:54.122 --> 04:00.846
and people will try to make it a point
that we have a large heart.

04:01.047 --> 04:04.621
Large heart doesn’t mean stupidity,
doesn’t mean that.

04:04.822 --> 04:11.812
Large heart means the heart in which
you can put Me in.

04:13.471 --> 04:17.221
It’s quite a big person, Myself,

04:17.422 --> 04:21.878
so you have to have a very large heart
that I could reside into your heart.

04:22.079 --> 04:26.239
That is the large heart and that’s what
you all should have.

04:26.440 --> 04:30.854
If that happens, then everything
will work out very well.
