00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:23.262
But first and foremost thing is to meditate
and to raise your Kundalini.

00:00:23.463 --> 00:00:27.777
Meditation is the only way you can grow.
There’s no other way out.

00:00:27.978 --> 00:00:33.486
Because when you meditate you are in
silence, you are in thoughtless awareness.

00:00:33.687 --> 00:00:40.010
Then the growth of awareness takes place,
then it opens out. But if you are thinking -

00:00:40.211 --> 00:00:44.024
supposing there is a lake and the lake
is completely in a turmoil.

00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:48.288
Nothing can grow. But supposing it is
silent,

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.416
then lotuses can grow, anything can
grow in it.

00:00:51.617 --> 00:00:54.928
In the same way, if your mind is agitated

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:02.634
and your growth is not yet fully expressing
itself,

00:01:02.835 --> 00:01:08.884
then it’s such a vicious circle that you
are agitated

00:01:09.085 --> 00:01:13.718
and your growth is hindered, again you
are agitated, your growth is hindered.

00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:17.698
So the best way is to take to meditation.

00:01:17.883 --> 00:01:23.243
When you take to meditation, this turmoil
will settle down.

00:01:23.444 --> 00:01:26.692
And when it will settle down, your growth
will take place.

00:01:26.893 --> 00:01:30.793
After meditation you’ll feel definitely
that you have come out very well,

00:01:30.994 --> 00:01:35.249
you have grown very well. But for that
one has to be very honest.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.625
You cannot force people to be honest.
That’s one thing you can’t do.

00:01:38.812 --> 00:01:42.137
You have to be honest yourself. You are
not to be hypocrite.

00:01:42.338 --> 00:01:44.694
You have to see for yourself that
whatever you are doing

00:01:44.895 --> 00:01:48.087
is for your benevolence, is for your good,

00:01:48.288 --> 00:01:52.559
and that you have to do it because it is
good for you, to begin with.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.900
And then for the good of the humanity.
You are doing for the good of the humanity.

00:01:58.101 --> 00:02:01.754
Now some people who come for the first
time will have lots of doubts

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:05.062
because of ego. They have lots of doubts
because of ego.

00:02:05.263 --> 00:02:11.827
“How can that be? How can this be? How?”
I mean, all kinds of things they ask.

00:02:12.028 --> 00:02:16.810
Now, you have to say that, first of all,
you develop your insight.

00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:20.859
You develop your enlightenment. Your light
is not sufficient.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.722
In the light only there are no doubts.
Supposing in darkness

00:02:25.923 --> 00:02:29.710
you think that this table has no cover.

00:02:29.911 --> 00:02:32.723
Is all right. You can think whatever you
like, but when there is light

00:02:32.924 --> 00:02:36.926
you see for yourself there is a beautiful
cover on top of this table.

00:02:37.127 --> 00:02:43.257
In the same way, it happens to us
that we have to achieve a state.

00:02:43.466 --> 00:02:48.240
And once we achieve that state then
there’s no question,

00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:52.292
there’s no doubt, there’s nothing,
and you become so empowered.

00:02:52.493 --> 00:02:59.027
It is such a simultaneous thing. It works.
As soon as you achieve something, it works.

00:02:59.228 --> 00:03:02.287
When it works, then you are convinced.

00:03:02.495 --> 00:03:08.540
It’s a, I’d say, is a very beautiful
new chain starts within yourself

00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:14.888
and then you really starts enjoying
your joy of your Self.

00:03:15.834 --> 00:03:20.937
In the most chaotic conditions this world
is today.

00:03:21.138 --> 00:03:29.873
So at that time, a kind of a silence
will come within you.

00:03:30.074 --> 00:03:35.411
When there will be any such crisis,
immediately you’ll become extremely silent.

00:03:35.626 --> 00:03:39.021
But this is again a state, I’m telling you.

00:03:39.231 --> 00:03:50.513
So now, if there is something that makes
you upset or makes you unhappy,

00:03:51.208 --> 00:03:58.630
try to reach that point, that axis,
which is just silence.

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:03.226
And this silence will make you really
powerful

00:04:03.427 --> 00:04:07.861
because this silence is not only yours.

00:04:08.062 --> 00:04:13.804
When you are in that silence you are
in the silence of the cosmos,

00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:24.307
silence of the cosmos. And the silence
of the cosmos works for you.

00:04:24.516 --> 00:04:34.052
You are in connection with that
Cosmic Power we can call it,

00:04:34.253 --> 00:04:38.127
but it’s more than that, is Divine Power,
I should say -

00:04:38.328 --> 00:04:43.403
Divine power which is working
all the cosmos also.

00:04:45.677 --> 00:04:55.516
So, if you just become silent within
yourself,

00:04:55.717 --> 00:05:01.075
know that you are sitting in the Kingdom
of God.

00:05:04.567 --> 00:05:10.271
It’s like this: when, say,

00:05:10.472 --> 00:05:22.226
you get the great honour of becoming
a king,

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:29.583
then you walk up to your throne
and you sit down

00:05:29.792 --> 00:05:37.334
and look around and you feel the silence

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:45.348
of this state that, now, you are the king.

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:53.614
This silence is the sign that you are
definitely, definitely,

00:05:53.852 --> 00:06:03.303
you are now in contact with the Divine.

00:06:03.504 --> 00:06:08.975
You are silent because the Divine is going
to look after everything.

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:14.675
You don’t have to do anything:
just keep silent.

00:06:14.876 --> 00:06:19.279
But not forcibly. It’s, again, a state.

00:06:20.054 --> 00:06:24.445
You see, if any turmoil takes place,
any problem takes place,

00:06:24.646 --> 00:06:30.200
suddenly your attention will jump
onto that silence,

00:06:30.574 --> 00:06:34.233
and once you jump onto that silence

00:06:34.434 --> 00:06:38.622
you [are] being in contact with this whole
All-pervading Power.

00:06:38.823 --> 00:06:41.388
And when I talk about All-pervading Power

00:06:41.549 --> 00:06:44.994
we still don’t understand what it is,

00:06:45.195 --> 00:06:48.619
what it means, this All-pervading Power
of love.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.618
Is it some sort of an energy floating
around?

00:06:52.819 --> 00:07:04.051
Or is it some sort of a river? Or some sort
of a ether?

00:07:07.321 --> 00:07:18.180
It is the complete, the totality
of Reality.
