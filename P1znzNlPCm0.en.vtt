WEBVTT

00:03.394 --> 00:08.102
Today is a great day for all of us

00:17.560 --> 00:23.310
that we are celebrating Navaratri today

00:23.643 --> 00:30.643
and all of us are meeting after such a long time of My tour.

00:36.143 --> 00:39.477
When in Italy I said that

00:39.768 --> 00:48.601
England is the heart of the universe,

00:48.851 --> 00:51.685
they would not accept it.

00:52.102 --> 00:54.851
They were very shocked at this statement.

00:55.102 --> 01:01.726
They couldn't believe that England could be the heart of the universe.

01:02.559 --> 01:08.726
One of the reasons was that they felt that

01:12.977 --> 01:19.977
that the English people were invaded once by Romans,

01:22.601 --> 01:27.810
and Romans at that time also had felt

01:28.060 --> 01:32.060
that English were very bumptious people.

01:32.643 --> 01:34.851
They would not even accept the defeat

01:35.060 --> 01:38.643
with the grace of a person who is lost.

01:38.893 --> 01:42.851
Even if they were lost, they used to be bumptious.

01:43.102 --> 01:45.560
So they could not believe how could it be

01:45.768 --> 01:48.685
that the English is the heart of the universe.

01:48.893 --> 01:53.685
If this is the heart, what's the situation of the universe?

01:54.310 --> 02:00.352
And then they described to Me at length the bumptiousness of the English,

02:00.935 --> 02:07.435
and then I felt I have known something like that Myself.

02:08.726 --> 02:14.102
Now, when we are celebrating the greatest of greatest this Navaratri,

02:14.352 --> 02:17.643
there must be something special about it,

02:17.893 --> 02:23.435
that we have to cleanse this heart completely,

02:24.643 --> 02:27.685
fully

02:29.726 --> 02:34.352
and make it so pure that it purifies all the blood

02:34.560 --> 02:39.310
that passes through the whole of the body.

02:40.601 --> 02:43.185
So the cells of this heart,

02:43.435 --> 02:47.185
which has made this great organ,

02:47.435 --> 02:54.851
has to be the best, because the cells of the heart

02:55.768 --> 03:04.352
within a human body are the best cells,

03:05.185 --> 03:09.060
the highest quality, the most sensitive.

03:11.519 --> 03:18.601
And it's the heart that expresses the Anahata,

03:19.935 --> 03:24.977
the sound that is without percussion.

03:27.435 --> 03:31.519
While we find

03:31.726 --> 03:37.060
that there are some people of caliber, there are,

03:37.269 --> 03:42.810
but others talk more, show off more,

03:43.060 --> 03:46.810
and do not have the caliber.

03:48.560 --> 03:53.851
Now to achieve that caliber should be possible

03:54.143 --> 03:59.560
because you are born on the special land of England.

04:00.559 --> 04:04.851
That possibility must be built within you.

04:05.143 --> 04:08.977
But then what is lacking?

04:10.935 --> 04:15.060
Why is it, that with all the possibility,

04:15.352 --> 04:18.643
with all the great background,

04:18.893 --> 04:24.810
with all the merits to be here,

04:25.102 --> 04:27.185
why is it we find

04:27.435 --> 04:34.435
that Sahaja yogis for years together do not come up to many others.

04:34.977 --> 04:37.893
What is the reason?

04:38.310 --> 04:43.018
Heart, if you see, has a pulse rate

04:43.269 --> 04:47.685
and it moves with a certain sound,

04:47.893 --> 04:51.394
and you can even get it on to a graph

04:51.643 --> 04:53.893
and it is so systematic,

04:54.185 --> 04:57.851
it is so regularized, it is so disciplined,

04:58.143 --> 05:01.519
that even a slightest murmur,

05:01.726 --> 05:06.394
or slightest change shows on the graph.

05:06.726 --> 05:10.560
Is a very sensitive thing.

05:10.893 --> 05:16.102
And that is what is lacking here, is that discipline of the heart.

05:16.352 --> 05:20.851
It's an erratic, funny heart

05:21.519 --> 05:25.060
which swells up in ego.

05:26.310 --> 05:28.102
And whatever one may talk,

05:28.352 --> 05:30.477
this is another reading people have,

05:30.685 --> 05:34.435
that whatever you may tell them, that time seriously they listen to you

05:34.643 --> 05:38.810
and second moment it has no effect on them.

05:40.851 --> 05:44.643
So this is another thing we should see that if it is within us,

05:44.893 --> 05:50.643
let us understand that what we lack is disciplining.

05:51.519 --> 05:58.519
And that disciplining has to come, otherwise our caliber cannot improve.

06:01.851 --> 06:08.102
But for all that, I think what we should have is innate intelligence.

06:08.394 --> 06:11.685
No education, innate intelligence.

06:11.977 --> 06:18.977
Innate intelligence to understand that our caliber has to improve.

06:23.643 --> 06:27.810
Now here pulsates the Spirit,

06:29.601 --> 06:34.726
the Spirit and not the Power.

06:35.519 --> 06:38.601
The witness,

06:39.143 --> 06:42.477
the one that watches,

06:42.768 --> 06:45.643
that is the reflection of God,

06:45.893 --> 06:53.018
who is the Spectator of the work of the Devi.

06:54.018 --> 06:56.435
Actually what happens

06:56.643 --> 07:01.726
that without rising up to that status

07:02.435 --> 07:03.102
if we also say,

07:03.310 --> 07:08.726
"All right, we are also watching because we are the Spirit,"

07:09.726 --> 07:15.143
then we do not achieve that caliber.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.977
And with all the blessings,

07:18.227 --> 07:25.227
like seven auras of the heart, we have got seven ashrams.

07:28.810 --> 07:35.519
We do not understand that we all have to discipline ourselves.

07:36.394 --> 07:38.935
Only to take advantage

07:39.185 --> 07:43.352
or to be in the Sahaja Yoga

07:43.601 --> 07:46.935
to claim that you are a Sahaja Yogi,

07:47.185 --> 07:55.185
is not a sign of being a cell of the heart.

07:59.143 --> 08:01.143
And warning has to be given now.

08:01.394 --> 08:04.185
Very important is at this juncture

08:04.394 --> 08:08.185
when Sahaja Yoga is now taking off, remember this,

08:08.435 --> 08:11.810
the speed has been gained and it is taking off.

08:12.102 --> 08:16.601
Those who will be left behind, will be left behind.

08:19.269 --> 08:21.102
So don't get into bumptiousness.

08:21.352 --> 08:24.060
First is your character, as everybody says,

08:24.310 --> 08:27.519
"They are very bumptious."

08:30.310 --> 08:35.143
Try to be humble

08:35.435 --> 08:39.352
and then understand that you have to be in the plane

08:39.559 --> 08:43.394
and not left behind on the grounds.

08:44.893 --> 08:48.559
It is moving fast.

08:50.102 --> 08:57.435
Now the most fortunate thing is

08:57.726 --> 09:00.352
that today is the Navaratri

09:00.601 --> 09:03.643
and that I should be in London

09:03.893 --> 09:08.060
and this Navaratri Puja should be performed here.

09:08.519 --> 09:10.810
No other country is that privileged,

09:11.102 --> 09:15.060
because this is the highest puja,

09:17.977 --> 09:22.977
the greatest ritual, which you can attend.

09:26.893 --> 09:31.018
So why do we do Navaratri?

09:33.643 --> 09:39.185
In the heart, to do Navaratri is to accept

09:41.102 --> 09:45.269
the powers of the Shakti,

09:46.851 --> 09:51.060
to realize the power

09:51.477 --> 09:56.102
that all these chakras have got in themselves,

09:57.185 --> 09:59.519
and that when they are enlightened

09:59.685 --> 10:03.394
how you can express all these powers

10:03.643 --> 10:06.601
of these nine chakras within ourselves;

10:06.893 --> 10:11.143
the seven chakras plus the heart and the moon makes it nine.

10:11.352 --> 10:13.185
But I would say that

10:13.394 --> 10:18.519
seven of these and on top of that we should say two more centers,

10:18.726 --> 10:24.435
which Blake has described surprisingly as nine centers, clearly.

10:24.685 --> 10:26.935
Just now I cannot talk of the higher two centers,

10:27.227 --> 10:32.726
but let us at least talk of the seven centers.

10:34.435 --> 10:36.352
The power of these centers,

10:36.559 --> 10:40.559
have we been able to develop within ourselves?

10:40.810 --> 10:42.893
How can you do it? You have no time.

10:43.185 --> 10:48.810
You are all busy people and bumptious.

10:50.893 --> 10:53.893
So now to develop these powers

10:54.185 --> 10:58.685
we have to concentrate on these chakras.

10:59.018 --> 11:01.685
Everywhere I went, I was surprised,

11:01.935 --> 11:04.768
the questions they asked Me, the way they were.

11:05.018 --> 11:09.685
Nobody talked about their family,house, jobs or

11:09.935 --> 11:13.726
any other nonsensical thing like

11:13.977 --> 11:16.601
unemployment and all that.

11:16.851 --> 11:17.601
They just asked Me,

11:17.810 --> 11:22.143
"Mother, how do we develop the power of this chakra,

11:22.352 --> 11:24.810
or that chakra or that chakra?"

11:25.435 --> 11:29.352
And I asked them, "How is it you are asking about a particular chakra?"

11:29.601 --> 11:33.394
They said, "Because we find this is missing in us,

11:35.352 --> 11:40.018
specially in me this one is not all right."

11:45.310 --> 11:49.601
This is another negativity to make My throat all right.

12:23.519 --> 12:26.185
Now for a realized soul

12:26.559 --> 12:29.685
there is no need for Me to discipline you or to tell you all these things,

12:29.977 --> 12:34.185
because I hate to talk in this tone to you today.

12:34.435 --> 12:39.394
But I have discovered, that if I do not warn you now,

12:39.643 --> 12:44.643
tomorrow you will blame Me that I did not warn you.

12:44.935 --> 12:49.726
Take it as a serious warning.

12:52.559 --> 12:55.643
Now after Realization

12:55.893 --> 12:59.726
there is no need for Me to discipline you at all,

12:59.977 --> 13:02.643
because you have got the light,

13:02.893 --> 13:08.435
you have known what is Realization,

13:08.851 --> 13:14.018
you have known what it means to be realized,

13:14.269 --> 13:18.102
and you have also known how much you have gained out of it,

13:18.394 --> 13:22.768
how much your personality has improved.

13:24.310 --> 13:30.977
But, there is something more that has to be done.

13:32.893 --> 13:35.143
Is to see for yourself,

13:35.394 --> 13:39.935
if you have really disciplined yourself or not.

13:40.227 --> 13:42.768
There is no need for any leader to tell you,

13:43.018 --> 13:47.310
there is no need for any ashram fellow to tell you,

13:47.559 --> 13:51.477
there is no need for anyone to tell you.

13:51.685 --> 13:55.560
It is you, who is a realized soul,

13:55.851 --> 13:58.768
you are your own master,

13:59.018 --> 14:04.685
you are your own guru. Imagine you are all gurus,

14:05.060 --> 14:10.810
great gurus and satgurus, respected saints

14:11.060 --> 14:16.185
where all the angels have to shower you with flowers.

14:16.435 --> 14:18.394
Think of it.

14:18.601 --> 14:24.601
And here you are bumptiously giving lectures, talking bumptiously.

14:26.352 --> 14:29.060
Very embarrassing even for the deities.

14:29.310 --> 14:34.726
They don't know what to do, whether to garland you or to shut your mouth.

14:35.185 --> 14:41.726
Here you are who have been,

15:00.768 --> 15:03.977
here you are in such a great position

15:04.227 --> 15:07.519
that you have got Realization.

15:08.102 --> 15:12.519
That only thing you have to accept

15:12.768 --> 15:18.935
the beauty of this great yoga,

15:19.685 --> 15:26.726
that you just enlighten your own powers,

15:27.018 --> 15:29.768
which are on these seven chakras.

15:30.060 --> 15:36.643
Now let us see the first chakra, belongs to the power of Gauri,

15:37.018 --> 15:43.269
the power of the Mother of Shri Ganesh.

15:46.560 --> 15:48.060
Gauri's power.

15:48.269 --> 15:50.768
Tremendous they are, aren't they?

15:51.060 --> 15:54.851
Because of Her power you have got your Realization.

15:55.143 --> 15:58.601
Now what have we done

16:00.185 --> 16:04.559
to enshrine that power within ourselves?

16:05.310 --> 16:08.435
Today, if it is the first day of Navaratri,

16:08.601 --> 16:12.310
let us see what have we done?

16:15.394 --> 16:22.269
Have we been able to develop our innocence within ourselves?

16:25.893 --> 16:29.185
When people talk, they are so sharp.

16:29.477 --> 16:32.643
How can you be sharp, if you are innocent?

16:32.935 --> 16:35.851
They are so bumptious.

16:36.102 --> 16:38.977
How can you be that, if you are innocent?

16:39.269 --> 16:40.810
People play games.

16:41.060 --> 16:45.060
How can you do that, if you are innocent?

16:45.269 --> 16:46.435
Harm each other.

16:46.601 --> 16:50.435
How can it be, if you are innocent?

16:50.810 --> 16:53.851
So first of all you have to see yourself,

16:54.102 --> 16:57.559
that the power of innocence, if it has to live,

16:57.768 --> 17:01.893
all the rest of the nonsense has to go away.

17:04.601 --> 17:07.143
If you want to have the innocence,

17:07.394 --> 17:12.560
all that is anti-innocence has to be dropped out.

17:14.060 --> 17:17.394
I can understand about people, who are ignorant,

17:17.601 --> 17:18.810
who have ignorance.

17:19.102 --> 17:23.060
Then in ignorance, of course how will they talk of innocence.

17:23.310 --> 17:26.935
But you are not ignorant people. You are knowledgeable,

17:27.185 --> 17:29.768
you've got your enlightenment.

17:30.018 --> 17:33.102
And the power of innocence is so great.

17:33.352 --> 17:37.810
It makes you absolutely fearless, not bumptious, but fearless.

17:38.102 --> 17:43.352
And the greatest thing of innocence is that you are respectful.

17:44.893 --> 17:48.269
The sense of respect,

17:49.269 --> 17:51.310
if it is not developed within you,

17:51.559 --> 17:56.977
if you cannot develop the sense of respect for other Sahaja Yogis,

17:57.227 --> 18:01.352
for other people, for the ashrams, for the discipline

18:01.560 --> 18:05.227
and your own self-respect,

18:05.435 --> 18:10.310
then it is of no use, even talking of Sahaja Yoga,

18:10.519 --> 18:14.143
because that is the very beginning of it.

18:14.977 --> 18:18.810
First you do not respect, all right, you are bumptious, all right,

18:19.102 --> 18:25.060
you are in a big fool's paradise, as they call it,

18:25.352 --> 18:27.768
riding a fast horse,

18:27.977 --> 18:31.269
all that is there is all right, is forgiven.

18:31.559 --> 18:33.977
But once you have seen the light,

18:34.227 --> 18:40.018
you must try to get rid of all the snakes

18:40.310 --> 18:43.477
that you have been holding on to.

18:46.560 --> 18:49.685
Is a simple thing.

18:50.018 --> 18:53.601
In your childlike nature only,

18:54.227 --> 18:58.102
you can receive the blessings of Gauri, otherwise you cannot.

18:58.394 --> 19:01.060
You have to be really childlike,

19:01.269 --> 19:07.060
otherwise it is absolutely useless, no use telling you anything,

19:07.269 --> 19:09.435
because you think you're too clever.

19:09.643 --> 19:11.977
To such a person, who thinks he is too clever,

19:12.185 --> 19:13.560
what's the use of talking to such a person,

19:13.768 --> 19:17.310
because he already knows everything.

19:17.810 --> 19:20.227
So the first power when you develop,

19:20.477 --> 19:25.269
you must learn to sit on the Mother Earth, first of all.

19:25.851 --> 19:27.851
You must respect the Mother Earth,

19:28.102 --> 19:31.601
because the first chakra is made out of the Mother Earth.

19:31.893 --> 19:37.726
Try to be more settled down with yourself on Mother Earth.

19:39.310 --> 19:40.810
And the respect.

19:41.018 --> 19:46.851
See the trees when they get their flowers,

19:47.143 --> 19:49.018
they are not so respectful,

19:49.227 --> 19:52.310
but when they are laden by the fruits,

19:52.560 --> 19:56.851
they bow down to Mother Earth.

19:58.102 --> 20:03.768
In the same way when you have got the fruits of Sahaja Yoga,

20:04.018 --> 20:07.394
you all must bow down.

20:10.310 --> 20:14.519
And innocence has a special capacity

20:14.726 --> 20:19.102
to make a person extremely peaceful,

20:20.060 --> 20:22.143
extremely peaceful.

20:22.394 --> 20:27.977
All the anger, temper, violence -

20:28.227 --> 20:31.685
if a person doesn't have innocence,

20:31.977 --> 20:36.851
it cannot come in you,

20:37.143 --> 20:40.185
because a person who is not innocent

20:40.477 --> 20:45.893
is either sly or aggressive.

20:47.227 --> 20:49.810
He cannot have peace within his heart.

20:50.060 --> 20:53.269
But a innocent person is not bothered, innocently he lives,

20:53.559 --> 20:59.768
he enjoys everything in complete peace and harmony.

21:01.810 --> 21:09.935
But this violence comes when a person becomes clever.

21:10.227 --> 21:13.477
He thinks, "I am so clever, the another one is so stupid,

21:13.685 --> 21:17.394
I have a right to shout at that person."

21:18.185 --> 21:23.685
And the one who is not innocent is never wise.

21:23.977 --> 21:27.310
He may be to look at look sharp, but he is not wise.

21:27.559 --> 21:31.685
Wisdom comes only with innocence.

21:31.977 --> 21:35.893
And how much wisdom have you gathered?

21:39.269 --> 21:41.477
That is what one has to see.

21:41.685 --> 21:45.810
When your power

21:46.143 --> 21:50.477
of innocence increases, wisdom is apparent.

21:50.768 --> 21:54.435
People say, "That fellow is very wise."

21:54.685 --> 21:58.477
For example if somebody is crying about his wife,

21:58.726 --> 22:01.102
a wise person will say, "Oh, Baba,

22:01.352 --> 22:04.310
just look at this, still busy with his wife."

22:04.559 --> 22:06.559
Another one is crying about his house or something.

22:06.726 --> 22:11.601
He will say, "Oh, look at this one, still busy with the house."

22:12.685 --> 22:16.810
There is no end to it.

22:18.269 --> 22:25.519
I've known people who get so swollen up

22:26.559 --> 22:31.269
that they think they must give a big lecture for one hour,

22:31.477 --> 22:32.560
on Sahaja Yoga.

22:32.851 --> 22:36.185
Unless and until they have given one hour lecture,

22:36.477 --> 22:41.601
they do not think their ego has manifested itself fully.

22:41.893 --> 22:44.477
But a wise person,

22:44.768 --> 22:50.227
he doesn't have to talk or speak or do anything.

22:50.477 --> 22:53.559
He impresses his silence,

22:53.810 --> 22:58.559
his wisdom on others much more easily.

22:59.060 --> 23:01.060
That is what we have to see,

23:01.269 --> 23:04.685
have we been able to discipline ourselves?

23:04.935 --> 23:09.310
Because our growth is very much in the beginning of it.

23:09.559 --> 23:13.185
We have to grow quite a lot

23:13.560 --> 23:16.352
And people don't understand this point

23:16.560 --> 23:21.394
in an atmosphere of egoistical temperament

23:21.643 --> 23:26.435
that you have to grow, you have not yet grown.

23:26.643 --> 23:30.310
You have to grow a lot.

23:30.935 --> 23:32.643
And when you grow

23:32.851 --> 23:39.352
you find this wisdom really fragrant with compassion.

23:39.601 --> 23:44.060
Your wisdom is fragrant with compassion.

23:45.435 --> 23:49.185
Such beautiful compassion

23:49.477 --> 23:53.310
can emit through your being,

23:53.601 --> 23:56.726
that anybody who comes in contact with you,

23:56.977 --> 24:00.810
will feel your auspiciousness.

24:01.768 --> 24:08.726
But, again, you must give due respect

24:08.977 --> 24:12.269
to your Self Realization and to your Self.

24:12.559 --> 24:16.477
That is the first thing you have to do, is to meditate.

24:16.726 --> 24:20.685
Somebody sent Me a letter and I saw the vibrations were horrid.

24:20.977 --> 24:23.352
I said, "What's the matter with this gentleman?

24:23.601 --> 24:27.559
His vibrations are so horrid, what is he doing?"

24:27.810 --> 24:31.394
Then I found out that he says he doesn't need any meditation.

24:31.643 --> 24:36.143
He has already reached the fourteenth heaven,

24:36.435 --> 24:40.310
so he doesn't need any meditation, doesn't have to do any meditation.

24:41.768 --> 24:46.519
Is easy to explain, but whom are you explaining?

24:46.810 --> 24:50.394
You have to explain to yourself,

24:50.643 --> 24:54.935
only yourself, nobody else wants your explanation.

24:55.435 --> 24:57.269
It's like missing the plane.

24:57.477 --> 24:58.810
When you miss the plane

24:59.060 --> 25:03.810
whom are you going to explain, the plane has left.

25:04.060 --> 25:07.768
So then you have to explain yourself only.

25:08.018 --> 25:13.560
You will tell the air, or to the gangway,

25:13.810 --> 25:16.559
or anything that, "Oh baba, it happened like that,

25:16.726 --> 25:20.269
there was this thing, I had no time, there was a jam, this, that."

25:20.559 --> 25:23.893
But the plane is gone.

25:24.477 --> 25:28.143
Whom are you explaining?

25:31.559 --> 25:38.018
So everyone should meditate every day.

25:38.310 --> 25:40.810
That is a very important thing,

25:41.060 --> 25:47.768
which people are doing in all the countries where I am not.

25:48.102 --> 25:52.269
Because I am in England, people take Me for granted.

25:52.519 --> 25:54.559
"Mother is doing everything."

25:54.810 --> 25:59.559
So I get up at 4 o'clock, take My bath, meditate for you all.

25:59.851 --> 26:02.102
I better start doing that again.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.018
Otherwise you have no time to meditate.

26:04.227 --> 26:07.560
So at least let Me meditate for your sake.

26:07.851 --> 26:10.352
So everyone must today promise to Me

26:10.559 --> 26:14.643
that they will meditate every day.

26:14.935 --> 26:17.893
Get up in the morning!

26:19.559 --> 26:20.643
"We can't get up in the morning."

26:20.851 --> 26:24.559
The whole world can get up, why not the English?

26:24.810 --> 26:27.601
But when it was the war of Waterloo,

26:27.810 --> 26:30.477
they were the first to arrive there.

26:30.726 --> 26:34.726
They won the war because they were so punctual.

26:34.977 --> 26:38.851
What has happened to their punctuality today?

26:46.185 --> 26:50.519
We are not drinking, we do not have hangovers,

26:50.726 --> 26:54.143
we don't sleep late,

26:54.435 --> 26:56.768
so why shouldn't we decide today

26:57.018 --> 27:01.810
that, "Every morning I'll get up and do my meditation.

27:02.102 --> 27:07.810
And while meditating I must concentrate on myself and not on others.

27:08.810 --> 27:10.726
And see for myself what is catching,

27:10.935 --> 27:12.935
where am I catching, which chakra I am catching,

27:13.185 --> 27:15.394
what have I to do?"

27:15.643 --> 27:18.060
So on this day of Navaratri,

27:18.352 --> 27:21.227
today as the first day,

27:21.559 --> 27:28.102
the Gauri's power must be enlightened within us, and they must express.

27:28.310 --> 27:33.851
And they are tremendous. I cannot describe them in one lecture.

27:34.559 --> 27:38.310
Think of the Primordial Kundalini.

27:38.559 --> 27:40.018
She acts in the Mother Earth,

27:40.227 --> 27:42.559
She acts in the universe,

27:42.851 --> 27:45.352
She acts in the animals,

27:45.559 --> 27:48.685
She acts in the matter,

27:48.893 --> 27:51.352
She acts in the human beings,

27:51.560 --> 27:55.477
and now She acts in you.

27:58.352 --> 28:01.601
She is the One who decides

28:01.810 --> 28:05.310
the face and the figure that you are going to have.

28:05.559 --> 28:09.269
She is the One who decides what child you should have.

28:09.519 --> 28:10.477
She is the One

28:10.643 --> 28:15.560
who gives you the particular type of a child that you need.

28:15.851 --> 28:20.477
She is the One who has got you all these beautiful children.

28:20.726 --> 28:21.559
She is the One

28:21.810 --> 28:26.102
who has given you these sparkling faces and sparkling eyes.

28:26.394 --> 28:29.185
All this She has done for you,

28:29.477 --> 28:34.185
but what about the Power that you have within yourself.

28:34.477 --> 28:37.143
How much have you manifested that?

28:37.435 --> 28:40.185
The Primordial is working very hard, no doubt.

28:40.477 --> 28:42.685
But what about you, the individuals,

28:42.977 --> 28:45.643
who have got their own Kundalini awakened?

28:45.935 --> 28:49.560
How far you have opened Her out.

28:49.935 --> 28:53.060
And what is Kundalini, is a simple thing as you know.

28:53.269 --> 28:56.060
Is the true desire.

28:56.269 --> 28:59.227
So true desire to perfect yourself, to grow yourself.

28:59.435 --> 29:04.435
If it is really true desire, nothing else is important.

29:09.519 --> 29:13.435
All other desires are secondary and tertiary.

29:13.685 --> 29:16.935
The most important desire is to grow.

29:17.227 --> 29:20.935
And for whose advantage ? Is the advantage of yours

29:21.185 --> 29:25.601
and in your advantage only, the advantage of the whole world rests.

29:25.851 --> 29:31.310
Sahaja Yogis today represent the growth of this universe,

29:31.559 --> 29:35.310
the growth of the human race.

29:35.601 --> 29:37.352
Do you follow this point

29:37.559 --> 29:41.559
that you are playing such an important role,

29:41.810 --> 29:45.726
role at such a crucial time

29:46.018 --> 29:50.310
when the world is about to collapse?

29:54.102 --> 29:58.477
And you have great seers like William Blake,

29:58.726 --> 30:03.559
you had such great people who have talked about this time.

30:03.810 --> 30:07.810
They have built it up, traditionally we have built up all this -

30:08.060 --> 30:11.685
now, in England.

30:14.810 --> 30:20.060
The work of ages that has brought this England to gestate...

30:20.352 --> 30:25.643
Now, do you realize

30:25.935 --> 30:32.227
that the position of English Sahaja Yogis is very important.

30:36.768 --> 30:43.143
But lack of wisdom and bumptiousness

30:43.477 --> 30:49.227
without understanding your Self,

30:49.477 --> 30:54.519
how can you talk so loud?

30:54.726 --> 30:59.935
How can you think of organizing everything

31:00.227 --> 31:05.977
when you yourself are so weak, so bumptious?

31:08.143 --> 31:12.768
So today I am not going to take the count of the people,

31:13.018 --> 31:16.477
who meditate every day or not.

31:16.726 --> 31:17.977
But I can tell you this much,

31:18.185 --> 31:22.519
next year those who do not meditate everyday,

31:22.768 --> 31:25.435
you will not be here anymore.

31:25.685 --> 31:28.726
Take it from Me.

31:29.559 --> 31:32.643
Is a fact.

31:33.227 --> 31:37.977
Every day you must meditate.

31:38.310 --> 31:40.227
Discipline yourself.

31:40.435 --> 31:45.559
Now you have come to a new perspection, perspective.

31:45.768 --> 31:47.519
You have come to a new vision.

31:47.768 --> 31:52.768
Now when you see that vision, when you know the vision,

31:53.060 --> 31:55.935
you cannot just stand there.

31:56.227 --> 31:59.269
Get into it!

32:07.560 --> 32:13.143
Everyone says, Damle was saying too, everybody says

32:13.394 --> 32:18.559
that, "Mother you have spent so much time for these English.

32:19.102 --> 32:22.143
Why so much time for them?"

32:29.935 --> 32:34.060
Maybe you might be thinking that because you are very great,

32:34.269 --> 32:37.060
that's why I have to serve you people.

32:37.310 --> 32:40.559
Think the way you like.

32:41.768 --> 32:46.935
But the most important thing is that you are on the land of Heart,

32:47.227 --> 32:52.018
and I have to cleanse you more, much more than others.

32:52.310 --> 32:56.269
But it's just the other way round. Others are going so fast.

32:56.559 --> 33:01.477
I am amazed, their vibrations, their sensitivity, their understanding.

33:01.643 --> 33:06.977
And they have just mastered it; every one of them.

33:08.643 --> 33:13.935
Here, it is becoming a very centralized stuff

33:14.143 --> 33:16.935
and everybody doesn't want to understand Sahaja Yoga,

33:17.185 --> 33:21.018
but everyone wants to give a lecture.

33:22.560 --> 33:26.060
There is no respect for elders.

33:28.477 --> 33:32.685
No respect who is older who is younger,

33:32.977 --> 33:34.559
and somebody who thinks that

33:34.768 --> 33:38.102
because they got Realization before others they are higher,

33:38.352 --> 33:44.810
then remember one word of Christ, that, "First will be the last."

33:47.060 --> 33:52.477
So try to understand that it is you who has to grow,

33:52.726 --> 33:56.935
it is you who has to manifest these powers.

33:57.143 --> 33:58.726
Manifestation of the power,

33:58.977 --> 34:02.810
I don't know how far you have understood.

34:03.477 --> 34:06.519
When a person who has Gauri's power,

34:06.768 --> 34:09.394
as soon as he enters a hall or any place,

34:09.601 --> 34:14.601
everybody's Kundalini rises, just to salute.

34:23.352 --> 34:25.810
When you have Gauri's power

34:26.102 --> 34:31.519
then you stand out because you have that innocent,

34:31.726 --> 34:37.227
lustless, greedless, beautiful, sparkling eyes

34:37.519 --> 34:39.060
and wherever you turn your eyes,

34:39.352 --> 34:45.102
even one glance would raise the Kundalini, immediately.

34:46.560 --> 34:50.018
People who suffer from cancer, suffer from this disease, that disease,

34:50.310 --> 34:52.185
all can be cured in no time

34:52.394 --> 34:57.185
if you have developed only one power of Gauri.

35:01.185 --> 35:04.559
All your problems can be solved.

35:04.810 --> 35:07.102
Negativity will go away

35:07.352 --> 35:12.185
and you will become like a lotus.

35:13.352 --> 35:17.643
Beautiful, fragrant,

35:19.851 --> 35:22.477
overpowering all kinds of negativity.

35:22.643 --> 35:27.643
Here it is, "That fellow just touched me

35:27.935 --> 35:31.477
and now I have become egoistical."

35:32.102 --> 35:34.601
If there is one fellow who is egoistical,

35:34.893 --> 35:38.060
he just talks to another person, the person goes egoistical.

35:38.310 --> 35:40.851
I mean this is not the way to be sensitive.

35:41.060 --> 35:45.601
You have to be sensitive to God and not to bad things.

35:45.893 --> 35:52.935
But we are more akin, more vulnerable to bad than to good.

35:55.310 --> 36:00.477
So the power, the power of assimilation of good,

36:00.726 --> 36:05.477
the power of emission of good,

36:05.685 --> 36:11.935
all these powers are just in your complete reach.

36:13.143 --> 36:18.269
But all this should not become a praise

36:18.519 --> 36:21.143
but should become a kind of a challenge,

36:21.394 --> 36:26.643
a kind of a beautiful curiosity

36:26.935 --> 36:30.352
and an advancement for you.

36:30.726 --> 36:34.269
But we are going down, I must tell you,

36:34.477 --> 36:37.352
we are going down in England.

36:37.601 --> 36:39.977
Because we have some funny tags,

36:40.269 --> 36:44.352
funny people who are all the time with tags.

36:44.601 --> 36:48.102
Such people will have to be warned,

36:48.394 --> 36:53.352
and later on may be declared, as these people have decided,

36:53.601 --> 36:57.310
should be declared as blacklisted.

37:01.060 --> 37:02.893
It's a very sad day today for Me

37:03.102 --> 37:05.102
and that is why the whole place is filled with -

37:05.310 --> 37:07.477
I mean I had no mind to have the puja here,

37:07.685 --> 37:08.935
because I am really very sad.

37:09.143 --> 37:12.726
Because when I see the vibrations, when I see the way things are,

37:12.977 --> 37:15.768
people are just in a picnic way in England,

37:16.060 --> 37:19.519
I feel so unhappy, you don't know.

37:23.143 --> 37:30.143
I have always been extremely enamored,

37:31.726 --> 37:36.559
and I have already put up a big show of appreciating your efforts.

37:36.851 --> 37:41.935
But if you see in the substance of it;

37:43.310 --> 37:46.601
just see the substance, you watch within yourself.

37:46.810 --> 37:51.643
Each individual should see the substance that is within us.

37:51.935 --> 37:54.685
We are worried about a friend,

37:54.977 --> 38:00.559
a fiancèe or a wife or a husband or this and that.

38:00.851 --> 38:04.185
That's not the caliber.

38:09.185 --> 38:12.519
The caliber is very low and is going down lower.

38:12.726 --> 38:15.310
That's not a good thing, is not good.

38:15.519 --> 38:20.227
If My love and compassion is spoiling you, I better pull you out of it.

38:20.519 --> 38:23.477
Because you are capable

38:23.685 --> 38:26.227
of your merits to be born in this country.

38:26.435 --> 38:29.185
You are capable of very great heights.

38:29.435 --> 38:32.185
I know that.

38:32.685 --> 38:35.643
Of very great heights, which you can achieve.

38:35.851 --> 38:39.394
But not by talking about it or thinking about it,

38:39.560 --> 38:45.102
but by becoming that great power,

38:46.310 --> 38:49.269
to become that power.

38:49.519 --> 38:51.601
And see the collective blessings people have

38:51.851 --> 38:55.227
and I was amazed when they told Me, they have got this blessing,

38:55.435 --> 38:56.810
they have got that blessing.

38:57.018 --> 39:01.643
I mean unlimited blessings they have got.

39:03.310 --> 39:06.394
And why can't we have that here?

39:06.643 --> 39:10.018
What's the problem with us?

39:10.851 --> 39:15.060
If we are not collective, if there is a problem between ourselves,

39:15.352 --> 39:18.685
that means there is some sort of an ego still in-between

39:18.893 --> 39:22.143
that is keeping us out.

39:24.601 --> 39:30.102
So let us now, promise within our heart

39:30.394 --> 39:33.143
that this has to go into our heart,

39:33.435 --> 39:38.935
a very deep feeling for ourselves,

39:39.269 --> 39:42.643
that by God's grace we are born at such a juncture

39:42.935 --> 39:45.768
when this thing has happened,

39:46.102 --> 39:49.394
that we are the people who are beneficiaries

39:49.643 --> 39:53.477
of the blessings of God that we have got our Realization,

39:53.768 --> 39:56.726
that we have risen so high.

39:57.018 --> 40:02.352
But now let us spread our wings, but we are cutting them down.

40:02.685 --> 40:04.559
Don't become small-minded people,

40:04.726 --> 40:07.227
worried about small, small things here and there.

40:07.477 --> 40:10.477
Nothing is important.

40:10.893 --> 40:13.768
If you see in your previous lives, you have had all kinds of foods,

40:13.977 --> 40:15.559
you have had all kinds of trips,

40:15.726 --> 40:20.477
you have done every kind of marriages, you have done every kind of

40:20.685 --> 40:24.601
other nonsensical thing that people waste time with.

40:24.893 --> 40:28.102
It's over now, finished. Now you do something new.

40:28.352 --> 40:31.893
How many people you have married in previous lives

40:32.143 --> 40:35.310
and how many houses you had in previous lives

40:35.559 --> 40:38.935
and how many pleasures you have had,

40:39.227 --> 40:42.352
finished now - finish it.

40:46.477 --> 40:50.477
This is a special time, the best time of Ritambhara

40:50.685 --> 40:54.810
where you have to grow. That's the point is, the season is that.

40:55.143 --> 40:58.768
In this season if you do not grow,

40:59.227 --> 41:01.977
you won't grow.

41:02.269 --> 41:06.018
You have to take full advantage.

41:06.435 --> 41:09.726
With full intensity

41:10.018 --> 41:12.559
you have to do Sahaja Yoga.

41:12.851 --> 41:14.935
That doesn't mean that you give up your jobs, or anything.

41:15.143 --> 41:18.559
If you are intense in Sahaja Yoga, you will be intense in everything.

41:18.768 --> 41:21.435
But there is no intensity.

41:21.643 --> 41:23.227
Munich I decided just,

41:23.519 --> 41:26.143
I don't know if Warren has told you - Munich

41:26.435 --> 41:27.935
"You didn't tell them about Munich?"

41:28.269 --> 41:31.310
All right - Munich. I decided last minute,

41:31.559 --> 41:32.601
because there was a horrid one

41:32.810 --> 41:35.060
who had come from Munich and had told Me

41:35.269 --> 41:39.435
that Munich's seekers will ask such questions.

41:39.726 --> 41:41.394
I didn't like them at all. She was very arrogant.

41:41.559 --> 41:43.060
I said I am not going to Munich.

41:43.310 --> 41:47.601
But in Vienna I just felt the vibrations of Munich.

41:47.893 --> 41:51.560
And I was amazed. I said, "All right, I am going to Munich."

41:51.851 --> 41:53.726
We had to run up and down to get My visa,

41:53.935 --> 41:57.977
this thing. Everything worked out, as usual.

41:58.352 --> 42:01.685
And in that short time, three days,

42:01.935 --> 42:04.018
four hundred people were there.

42:04.310 --> 42:09.810
And so intense, I tell you, so intense, even children, so intense,

42:10.102 --> 42:14.102
and they were listening to every word I was saying,

42:14.352 --> 42:17.227
and picking up as pearls,

42:17.477 --> 42:19.810
precious as diamonds,

42:20.018 --> 42:23.768
every word they were noting it down.

42:24.060 --> 42:27.643
And when they had their Realization they were just stunned people.

42:27.935 --> 42:31.601
Imagine the Germans, coming over you people, English.

42:31.810 --> 42:34.851
What will happen to you?

42:36.060 --> 42:38.352
They are people of determination.

42:38.560 --> 42:42.851
If they decide to do good, they'll do lot of good.

42:43.102 --> 42:45.893
They are not like this.

42:46.185 --> 42:48.310
And then when I left them,

42:48.559 --> 42:52.310
for one hour they were in the hall, just stunned,

42:52.601 --> 42:55.768
discussing about Sahaja Yoga.

43:00.227 --> 43:02.977
But here as soon as I go away,

43:03.185 --> 43:05.685
people start discussing something so nonsensical.

43:05.977 --> 43:09.477
I hear it. I know the vibrations and everything.

43:09.685 --> 43:13.977
We are not intense, we must increase our intensity.

43:14.227 --> 43:17.893
That is what is called as Shraddha.

43:19.685 --> 43:23.977
Is important, very important.

43:25.559 --> 43:31.643
And I am sure this year you will make it a point

43:31.977 --> 43:37.185
to do intense understanding of Sahaja Yoga.

43:38.519 --> 43:41.601
That intensity is lacking.

43:42.018 --> 43:46.185
May be there is something gone wrong with you in the past

43:46.477 --> 43:50.018
and you are conditioned about it, or you think about it.

43:50.310 --> 43:53.726
How can I do it, it is too much.

43:53.977 --> 43:58.977
You can do it, everything, you forget the past, forget the past.

43:59.269 --> 44:03.726
Past has no meaning whatsoever in Sahaja Yoga.

44:06.559 --> 44:09.310
You are being completely renovated

44:09.560 --> 44:13.102
but just use your mechanism.

44:13.394 --> 44:14.935
I have worked so hard with you people

44:15.143 --> 44:17.435
that nothing wrong with your mechanism.

44:17.685 --> 44:21.559
Only thing you have no faith in yourself.

44:22.185 --> 44:23.851
And those who do not have faith in themselves

44:24.060 --> 44:27.185
are always bumptious people.

44:27.893 --> 44:33.060
So first of all station yourself within your Spirit,

44:33.310 --> 44:38.893
within your heart and try to develop your powers,

44:39.185 --> 44:42.102
inner powers, not of talking and showing off,

44:42.310 --> 44:45.352
but inner powers.

44:50.394 --> 44:54.269
Still so many are possessed, you know that.

44:54.559 --> 44:57.143
It's a shameful thing

44:57.352 --> 45:00.810
that even now in the temple of God there are people

45:01.102 --> 45:05.685
who are possessed by horrible evil things.

45:05.935 --> 45:08.685
How can it be?

45:09.060 --> 45:14.768
You are the carrier of all these, even now, how can it be?

45:19.018 --> 45:22.269
So one has to be very intensely there,

45:22.559 --> 45:24.935
and those today who are looking to be nothing,

45:25.143 --> 45:27.477
will grow into something so great,

45:27.643 --> 45:30.310
that you will be amazed at yourself.

45:30.559 --> 45:34.185
"How is it I have become so great?"

45:34.519 --> 45:39.269
But the first and foremost thing is disciplining.

45:40.893 --> 45:43.643
Discipline yourself.

45:43.893 --> 45:46.352
When it comes to eating, some people eat too much.

45:46.601 --> 45:49.477
When it comes to talking, some people talk too much.

45:49.685 --> 45:53.310
Or they do not talk at all, or they eat not at all.

45:53.559 --> 45:55.685
All this is indiscipline.

45:55.977 --> 45:59.102
But going higher to this spiritual life,

45:59.394 --> 46:02.102
best thing is to take the discipline from your Spirit

46:02.310 --> 46:04.310
and you are disciplined automatically.

46:04.559 --> 46:08.018
Let the Spirit rule you.

46:09.810 --> 46:12.726
It's possible. It's possible,

46:13.060 --> 46:15.227
because I have seen in such a short time

46:15.477 --> 46:19.768
and when I have been there for such a short time,

46:20.018 --> 46:22.185
I don't even know their names.

46:22.477 --> 46:24.559
Here practically I know all of you,

46:24.768 --> 46:28.851
by your names, and by your vibrations also.

46:29.185 --> 46:32.726
And they have gone up so much.

46:33.726 --> 46:36.060
So, today is a great day.

46:36.352 --> 46:38.685
Of course a great privilege.

46:38.977 --> 46:44.352
Always you are privileged people, like House of Lords.

46:44.810 --> 46:46.601
Is true, but may be,

46:46.893 --> 46:51.810
one day may come when this House of Lords may be banished completely.

46:52.102 --> 46:55.477
You have to behave like lords.

46:58.143 --> 47:01.601
That is why My humble request is

47:01.851 --> 47:05.060
that you must learn

47:05.310 --> 47:08.559
to worship discipline.

47:08.893 --> 47:10.893
I don't say, "Do this, do that."

47:11.185 --> 47:13.435
You know what is to be done.

47:13.601 --> 47:15.559
And then on top of that, you should not tell Me,

47:15.726 --> 47:18.726
"I know, I should have, I know."

47:18.977 --> 47:23.851
When you know, why don't you do it? You are empowered.

47:24.143 --> 47:28.601
Today let us, with full confidence in ourselves

47:28.893 --> 47:30.560
and in our ascent,

47:30.851 --> 47:34.394
let us with full intensity attend this Puja

47:34.643 --> 47:36.519
and in our hearts decide

47:36.768 --> 47:40.477
that, "I am going to discipline myself."

47:44.394 --> 47:48.143
May God bless you.
