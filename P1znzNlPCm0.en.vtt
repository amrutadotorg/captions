00:00:03.394 --> 00:00:08.102
Today is a great day for all of us

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.310
that we are celebrating Navaratri today

00:00:23.643 --> 00:00:30.643
and all of us are meeting after such a long time of My tour.

00:00:36.143 --> 00:00:39.477
When in Italy I said that

00:00:39.768 --> 00:00:48.601
England is the heart of the universe,

00:00:48.851 --> 00:00:51.685
they would not accept it.

00:00:52.102 --> 00:00:54.851
They were very shocked at this statement.

00:00:55.102 --> 00:01:01.726
They couldn't believe that England could be the heart of the universe.

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:08.726
One of the reasons was that they felt that

00:01:12.977 --> 00:01:19.977
that the English people were invaded once by Romans,

00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:27.810
and Romans at that time also had felt

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.060
that English were very bumptious people.

00:01:32.643 --> 00:01:34.851
They would not even accept the defeat

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.643
with the grace of a person who is lost.

00:01:38.893 --> 00:01:42.851
Even if they were lost, they used to be bumptious.

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:45.560
So they could not believe how could it be

00:01:45.768 --> 00:01:48.685
that the English is the heart of the universe.

00:01:48.893 --> 00:01:53.685
If this is the heart, what's the situation of the universe?

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.352
And then they described to Me at length the bumptiousness of the English,

00:02:00.935 --> 00:02:07.435
and then I felt I have known something like that Myself.

00:02:08.726 --> 00:02:14.102
Now, when we are celebrating the greatest of greatest this Navaratri,

00:02:14.352 --> 00:02:17.643
there must be something special about it,

00:02:17.893 --> 00:02:23.435
that we have to cleanse this heart completely,

00:02:24.643 --> 00:02:27.685
fully

00:02:29.726 --> 00:02:34.352
and make it so pure that it purifies all the blood

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.310
that passes through the whole of the body.

00:02:40.601 --> 00:02:43.185
So the cells of this heart,

00:02:43.435 --> 00:02:47.185
which has made this great organ,

00:02:47.435 --> 00:02:54.851
has to be the best, because the cells of the heart

00:02:55.768 --> 00:03:04.352
within a human body are the best cells,

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:09.060
the highest quality, the most sensitive.

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:18.601
And it's the heart that expresses the Anahata,

00:03:19.935 --> 00:03:24.977
the sound that is without percussion.

00:03:27.435 --> 00:03:31.519
While we find

00:03:31.726 --> 00:03:37.060
that there are some people of caliber, there are,

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.810
but others talk more, show off more,

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.810
and do not have the caliber.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.851
Now to achieve that caliber should be possible

00:03:54.143 --> 00:03:59.560
because you are born on the special land of England.

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:04.851
That possibility must be built within you.

00:04:05.143 --> 00:04:08.977
But then what is lacking?

00:04:10.935 --> 00:04:15.060
Why is it, that with all the possibility,

00:04:15.352 --> 00:04:18.643
with all the great background,

00:04:18.893 --> 00:04:24.810
with all the merits to be here,

00:04:25.102 --> 00:04:27.185
why is it we find

00:04:27.435 --> 00:04:34.435
that Sahaja yogis for years together do not come up to many others.

00:04:34.977 --> 00:04:37.893
What is the reason?

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.018
Heart, if you see, has a pulse rate

00:04:43.269 --> 00:04:47.685
and it moves with a certain sound,

00:04:47.893 --> 00:04:51.394
and you can even get it on to a graph

00:04:51.643 --> 00:04:53.893
and it is so systematic,

00:04:54.185 --> 00:04:57.851
it is so regularized, it is so disciplined,

00:04:58.143 --> 00:05:01.519
that even a slightest murmur,

00:05:01.726 --> 00:05:06.394
or slightest change shows on the graph.

00:05:06.726 --> 00:05:10.560
Is a very sensitive thing.

00:05:10.893 --> 00:05:16.102
And that is what is lacking here, is that discipline of the heart.

00:05:16.352 --> 00:05:20.851
It's an erratic, funny heart

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:25.060
which swells up in ego.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.102
And whatever one may talk,

00:05:28.352 --> 00:05:30.477
this is another reading people have,

00:05:30.685 --> 00:05:34.435
that whatever you may tell them, that time seriously they listen to you

00:05:34.643 --> 00:05:38.810
and second moment it has no effect on them.

00:05:40.851 --> 00:05:44.643
So this is another thing we should see that if it is within us,

00:05:44.893 --> 00:05:50.643
let us understand that what we lack is disciplining.

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:58.519
And that disciplining has to come, otherwise our caliber cannot improve.

00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:08.102
But for all that, I think what we should have is innate intelligence.

00:06:08.394 --> 00:06:11.685
No education, innate intelligence.

00:06:11.977 --> 00:06:18.977
Innate intelligence to understand that our caliber has to improve.

00:06:23.643 --> 00:06:27.810
Now here pulsates the Spirit,

00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:34.726
the Spirit and not the Power.

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:38.601
The witness,

00:06:39.143 --> 00:06:42.477
the one that watches,

00:06:42.768 --> 00:06:45.643
that is the reflection of God,

00:06:45.893 --> 00:06:53.018
who is the Spectator of the work of the Devi.

00:06:54.018 --> 00:06:56.435
Actually what happens

00:06:56.643 --> 00:07:01.726
that without rising up to that status

00:07:02.435 --> 00:07:03.102
if we also say,

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:08.726
"All right, we are also watching because we are the Spirit,"

00:07:09.726 --> 00:07:15.143
then we do not achieve that caliber.

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:17.977
And with all the blessings,

00:07:18.227 --> 00:07:25.227
like seven auras of the heart, we have got seven ashrams.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:35.519
We do not understand that we all have to discipline ourselves.

00:07:36.394 --> 00:07:38.935
Only to take advantage

00:07:39.185 --> 00:07:43.352
or to be in the Sahaja Yoga

00:07:43.601 --> 00:07:46.935
to claim that you are a Sahaja Yogi,

00:07:47.185 --> 00:07:55.185
is not a sign of being a cell of the heart.

00:07:59.143 --> 00:08:01.143
And warning has to be given now.

00:08:01.394 --> 00:08:04.185
Very important is at this juncture

00:08:04.394 --> 00:08:08.185
when Sahaja Yoga is now taking off, remember this,

00:08:08.435 --> 00:08:11.810
the speed has been gained and it is taking off.

00:08:12.102 --> 00:08:16.601
Those who will be left behind, will be left behind.

00:08:19.269 --> 00:08:21.102
So don't get into bumptiousness.

00:08:21.352 --> 00:08:24.060
First is your character, as everybody says,

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.519
"They are very bumptious."

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:35.143
Try to be humble

00:08:35.435 --> 00:08:39.352
and then understand that you have to be in the plane

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:43.394
and not left behind on the grounds.

00:08:44.893 --> 00:08:48.559
It is moving fast.

00:08:50.102 --> 00:08:57.435
Now the most fortunate thing is

00:08:57.726 --> 00:09:00.352
that today is the Navaratri

00:09:00.601 --> 00:09:03.643
and that I should be in London

00:09:03.893 --> 00:09:08.060
and this Navaratri Puja should be performed here.

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:10.810
No other country is that privileged,

00:09:11.102 --> 00:09:15.060
because this is the highest puja,

00:09:17.977 --> 00:09:22.977
the greatest ritual, which you can attend.

00:09:26.893 --> 00:09:31.018
So why do we do Navaratri?

00:09:33.643 --> 00:09:39.185
In the heart, to do Navaratri is to accept

00:09:41.102 --> 00:09:45.269
the powers of the Shakti,

00:09:46.851 --> 00:09:51.060
to realize the power

00:09:51.477 --> 00:09:56.102
that all these chakras have got in themselves,

00:09:57.185 --> 00:09:59.519
and that when they are enlightened

00:09:59.685 --> 00:10:03.394
how you can express all these powers

00:10:03.643 --> 00:10:06.601
of these nine chakras within ourselves;

00:10:06.893 --> 00:10:11.143
the seven chakras plus the heart and the moon makes it nine.

00:10:11.352 --> 00:10:13.185
But I would say that

00:10:13.394 --> 00:10:18.519
seven of these and on top of that we should say two more centers,

00:10:18.726 --> 00:10:24.435
which Blake has described surprisingly as nine centers, clearly.

00:10:24.685 --> 00:10:26.935
Just now I cannot talk of the higher two centers,

00:10:27.227 --> 00:10:32.726
but let us at least talk of the seven centers.

00:10:34.435 --> 00:10:36.352
The power of these centers,

00:10:36.559 --> 00:10:40.559
have we been able to develop within ourselves?

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:42.893
How can you do it? You have no time.

00:10:43.185 --> 00:10:48.810
You are all busy people and bumptious.

00:10:50.893 --> 00:10:53.893
So now to develop these powers

00:10:54.185 --> 00:10:58.685
we have to concentrate on these chakras.

00:10:59.018 --> 00:11:01.685
Everywhere I went, I was surprised,

00:11:01.935 --> 00:11:04.768
the questions they asked Me, the way they were.

00:11:05.018 --> 00:11:09.685
Nobody talked about their family,house, jobs or

00:11:09.935 --> 00:11:13.726
any other nonsensical thing like

00:11:13.977 --> 00:11:16.601
unemployment and all that.

00:11:16.851 --> 00:11:17.601
They just asked Me,

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:22.143
"Mother, how do we develop the power of this chakra,

00:11:22.352 --> 00:11:24.810
or that chakra or that chakra?"

00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:29.352
And I asked them, "How is it you are asking about a particular chakra?"

00:11:29.601 --> 00:11:33.394
They said, "Because we find this is missing in us,

00:11:35.352 --> 00:11:40.018
specially in me this one is not all right."

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:49.601
This is another negativity to make My throat all right.

00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:26.185
Now for a realized soul

00:12:26.559 --> 00:12:29.685
there is no need for Me to discipline you or to tell you all these things,

00:12:29.977 --> 00:12:34.185
because I hate to talk in this tone to you today.

00:12:34.435 --> 00:12:39.394
But I have discovered, that if I do not warn you now,

00:12:39.643 --> 00:12:44.643
tomorrow you will blame Me that I did not warn you.

00:12:44.935 --> 00:12:49.726
Take it as a serious warning.

00:12:52.559 --> 00:12:55.643
Now after Realization

00:12:55.893 --> 00:12:59.726
there is no need for Me to discipline you at all,

00:12:59.977 --> 00:13:02.643
because you have got the light,

00:13:02.893 --> 00:13:08.435
you have known what is Realization,

00:13:08.851 --> 00:13:14.018
you have known what it means to be realized,

00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:18.102
and you have also known how much you have gained out of it,

00:13:18.394 --> 00:13:22.768
how much your personality has improved.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:30.977
But, there is something more that has to be done.

00:13:32.893 --> 00:13:35.143
Is to see for yourself,

00:13:35.394 --> 00:13:39.935
if you have really disciplined yourself or not.

00:13:40.227 --> 00:13:42.768
There is no need for any leader to tell you,

00:13:43.018 --> 00:13:47.310
there is no need for any ashram fellow to tell you,

00:13:47.559 --> 00:13:51.477
there is no need for anyone to tell you.

00:13:51.685 --> 00:13:55.560
It is you, who is a realized soul,

00:13:55.851 --> 00:13:58.768
you are your own master,

00:13:59.018 --> 00:14:04.685
you are your own guru. Imagine you are all gurus,

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:10.810
great gurus and satgurus, respected saints

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:16.185
where all the angels have to shower you with flowers.

00:14:16.435 --> 00:14:18.394
Think of it.

00:14:18.601 --> 00:14:24.601
And here you are bumptiously giving lectures, talking bumptiously.

00:14:26.352 --> 00:14:29.060
Very embarrassing even for the deities.

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:34.726
They don't know what to do, whether to garland you or to shut your mouth.

00:14:35.185 --> 00:14:41.726
Here you are who have been,

00:15:00.768 --> 00:15:03.977
here you are in such a great position

00:15:04.227 --> 00:15:07.519
that you have got Realization.

00:15:08.102 --> 00:15:12.519
That only thing you have to accept

00:15:12.768 --> 00:15:18.935
the beauty of this great yoga,

00:15:19.685 --> 00:15:26.726
that you just enlighten your own powers,

00:15:27.018 --> 00:15:29.768
which are on these seven chakras.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:36.643
Now let us see the first chakra, belongs to the power of Gauri,

00:15:37.018 --> 00:15:43.269
the power of the Mother of Shri Ganesh.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.060
Gauri's power.

00:15:48.269 --> 00:15:50.768
Tremendous they are, aren't they?

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:54.851
Because of Her power you have got your Realization.

00:15:55.143 --> 00:15:58.601
Now what have we done

00:16:00.185 --> 00:16:04.559
to enshrine that power within ourselves?

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:08.435
Today, if it is the first day of Navaratri,

00:16:08.601 --> 00:16:12.310
let us see what have we done?

00:16:15.394 --> 00:16:22.269
Have we been able to develop our innocence within ourselves?

00:16:25.893 --> 00:16:29.185
When people talk, they are so sharp.

00:16:29.477 --> 00:16:32.643
How can you be sharp, if you are innocent?

00:16:32.935 --> 00:16:35.851
They are so bumptious.

00:16:36.102 --> 00:16:38.977
How can you be that, if you are innocent?

00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:40.810
People play games.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:45.060
How can you do that, if you are innocent?

00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:46.435
Harm each other.

00:16:46.601 --> 00:16:50.435
How can it be, if you are innocent?

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:53.851
So first of all you have to see yourself,

00:16:54.102 --> 00:16:57.559
that the power of innocence, if it has to live,

00:16:57.768 --> 00:17:01.893
all the rest of the nonsense has to go away.

00:17:04.601 --> 00:17:07.143
If you want to have the innocence,

00:17:07.394 --> 00:17:12.560
all that is anti-innocence has to be dropped out.

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:17.394
I can understand about people, who are ignorant,

00:17:17.601 --> 00:17:18.810
who have ignorance.

00:17:19.102 --> 00:17:23.060
Then in ignorance, of course how will they talk of innocence.

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:26.935
But you are not ignorant people. You are knowledgeable,

00:17:27.185 --> 00:17:29.768
you've got your enlightenment.

00:17:30.018 --> 00:17:33.102
And the power of innocence is so great.

00:17:33.352 --> 00:17:37.810
It makes you absolutely fearless, not bumptious, but fearless.

00:17:38.102 --> 00:17:43.352
And the greatest thing of innocence is that you are respectful.

00:17:44.893 --> 00:17:48.269
The sense of respect,

00:17:49.269 --> 00:17:51.310
if it is not developed within you,

00:17:51.559 --> 00:17:56.977
if you cannot develop the sense of respect for other Sahaja Yogis,

00:17:57.227 --> 00:18:01.352
for other people, for the ashrams, for the discipline

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:05.227
and your own self-respect,

00:18:05.435 --> 00:18:10.310
then it is of no use, even talking of Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:10.519 --> 00:18:14.143
because that is the very beginning of it.

00:18:14.977 --> 00:18:18.810
First you do not respect, all right, you are bumptious, all right,

00:18:19.102 --> 00:18:25.060
you are in a big fool's paradise, as they call it,

00:18:25.352 --> 00:18:27.768
riding a fast horse,

00:18:27.977 --> 00:18:31.269
all that is there is all right, is forgiven.

00:18:31.559 --> 00:18:33.977
But once you have seen the light,

00:18:34.227 --> 00:18:40.018
you must try to get rid of all the snakes

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:43.477
that you have been holding on to.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.685
Is a simple thing.

00:18:50.018 --> 00:18:53.601
In your childlike nature only,

00:18:54.227 --> 00:18:58.102
you can receive the blessings of Gauri, otherwise you cannot.

00:18:58.394 --> 00:19:01.060
You have to be really childlike,

00:19:01.269 --> 00:19:07.060
otherwise it is absolutely useless, no use telling you anything,

00:19:07.269 --> 00:19:09.435
because you think you're too clever.

00:19:09.643 --> 00:19:11.977
To such a person, who thinks he is too clever,

00:19:12.185 --> 00:19:13.560
what's the use of talking to such a person,

00:19:13.768 --> 00:19:17.310
because he already knows everything.

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:20.227
So the first power when you develop,

00:19:20.477 --> 00:19:25.269
you must learn to sit on the Mother Earth, first of all.

00:19:25.851 --> 00:19:27.851
You must respect the Mother Earth,

00:19:28.102 --> 00:19:31.601
because the first chakra is made out of the Mother Earth.

00:19:31.893 --> 00:19:37.726
Try to be more settled down with yourself on Mother Earth.

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:40.810
And the respect.

00:19:41.018 --> 00:19:46.851
See the trees when they get their flowers,

00:19:47.143 --> 00:19:49.018
they are not so respectful,

00:19:49.227 --> 00:19:52.310
but when they are laden by the fruits,

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:56.851
they bow down to Mother Earth.

00:19:58.102 --> 00:20:03.768
In the same way when you have got the fruits of Sahaja Yoga,

00:20:04.018 --> 00:20:07.394
you all must bow down.

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:14.519
And innocence has a special capacity

00:20:14.726 --> 00:20:19.102
to make a person extremely peaceful,

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.143
extremely peaceful.

00:20:22.394 --> 00:20:27.977
All the anger, temper, violence -

00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:31.685
if a person doesn't have innocence,

00:20:31.977 --> 00:20:36.851
it cannot come in you,

00:20:37.143 --> 00:20:40.185
because a person who is not innocent

00:20:40.477 --> 00:20:45.893
is either sly or aggressive.

00:20:47.227 --> 00:20:49.810
He cannot have peace within his heart.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.269
But a innocent person is not bothered, innocently he lives,

00:20:53.559 --> 00:20:59.768
he enjoys everything in complete peace and harmony.

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:09.935
But this violence comes when a person becomes clever.

00:21:10.227 --> 00:21:13.477
He thinks, "I am so clever, the another one is so stupid,

00:21:13.685 --> 00:21:17.394
I have a right to shout at that person."

00:21:18.185 --> 00:21:23.685
And the one who is not innocent is never wise.

00:21:23.977 --> 00:21:27.310
He may be to look at look sharp, but he is not wise.

00:21:27.559 --> 00:21:31.685
Wisdom comes only with innocence.

00:21:31.977 --> 00:21:35.893
And how much wisdom have you gathered?

00:21:39.269 --> 00:21:41.477
That is what one has to see.

00:21:41.685 --> 00:21:45.810
When your power

00:21:46.143 --> 00:21:50.477
of innocence increases, wisdom is apparent.

00:21:50.768 --> 00:21:54.435
People say, "That fellow is very wise."

00:21:54.685 --> 00:21:58.477
For example if somebody is crying about his wife,

00:21:58.726 --> 00:22:01.102
a wise person will say, "Oh, Baba,

00:22:01.352 --> 00:22:04.310
just look at this, still busy with his wife."

00:22:04.559 --> 00:22:06.559
Another one is crying about his house or something.

00:22:06.726 --> 00:22:11.601
He will say, "Oh, look at this one, still busy with the house."

00:22:12.685 --> 00:22:16.810
There is no end to it.

00:22:18.269 --> 00:22:25.519
I've known people who get so swollen up

00:22:26.559 --> 00:22:31.269
that they think they must give a big lecture for one hour,

00:22:31.477 --> 00:22:32.560
on Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:32.851 --> 00:22:36.185
Unless and until they have given one hour lecture,

00:22:36.477 --> 00:22:41.601
they do not think their ego has manifested itself fully.

00:22:41.893 --> 00:22:44.477
But a wise person,

00:22:44.768 --> 00:22:50.227
he doesn't have to talk or speak or do anything.

00:22:50.477 --> 00:22:53.559
He impresses his silence,

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:58.559
his wisdom on others much more easily.

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.060
That is what we have to see,

00:23:01.269 --> 00:23:04.685
have we been able to discipline ourselves?

00:23:04.935 --> 00:23:09.310
Because our growth is very much in the beginning of it.

00:23:09.559 --> 00:23:13.185
We have to grow quite a lot

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.352
And people don't understand this point

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:21.394
in an atmosphere of egoistical temperament

00:23:21.643 --> 00:23:26.435
that you have to grow, you have not yet grown.

00:23:26.643 --> 00:23:30.310
You have to grow a lot.

00:23:30.935 --> 00:23:32.643
And when you grow

00:23:32.851 --> 00:23:39.352
you find this wisdom really fragrant with compassion.

00:23:39.601 --> 00:23:44.060
Your wisdom is fragrant with compassion.

00:23:45.435 --> 00:23:49.185
Such beautiful compassion

00:23:49.477 --> 00:23:53.310
can emit through your being,

00:23:53.601 --> 00:23:56.726
that anybody who comes in contact with you,

00:23:56.977 --> 00:24:00.810
will feel your auspiciousness.

00:24:01.768 --> 00:24:08.726
But, again, you must give due respect

00:24:08.977 --> 00:24:12.269
to your Self Realization and to your Self.

00:24:12.559 --> 00:24:16.477
That is the first thing you have to do, is to meditate.

00:24:16.726 --> 00:24:20.685
Somebody sent Me a letter and I saw the vibrations were horrid.

00:24:20.977 --> 00:24:23.352
I said, "What's the matter with this gentleman?

00:24:23.601 --> 00:24:27.559
His vibrations are so horrid, what is he doing?"

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:31.394
Then I found out that he says he doesn't need any meditation.

00:24:31.643 --> 00:24:36.143
He has already reached the fourteenth heaven,

00:24:36.435 --> 00:24:40.310
so he doesn't need any meditation, doesn't have to do any meditation.

00:24:41.768 --> 00:24:46.519
Is easy to explain, but whom are you explaining?

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:50.394
You have to explain to yourself,

00:24:50.643 --> 00:24:54.935
only yourself, nobody else wants your explanation.

00:24:55.435 --> 00:24:57.269
It's like missing the plane.

00:24:57.477 --> 00:24:58.810
When you miss the plane

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:03.810
whom are you going to explain, the plane has left.

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:07.768
So then you have to explain yourself only.

00:25:08.018 --> 00:25:13.560
You will tell the air, or to the gangway,

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:16.559
or anything that, "Oh baba, it happened like that,

00:25:16.726 --> 00:25:20.269
there was this thing, I had no time, there was a jam, this, that."

00:25:20.559 --> 00:25:23.893
But the plane is gone.

00:25:24.477 --> 00:25:28.143
Whom are you explaining?

00:25:31.559 --> 00:25:38.018
So everyone should meditate every day.

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:40.810
That is a very important thing,

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:47.768
which people are doing in all the countries where I am not.

00:25:48.102 --> 00:25:52.269
Because I am in England, people take Me for granted.

00:25:52.519 --> 00:25:54.559
"Mother is doing everything."

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:59.559
So I get up at 4 o'clock, take My bath, meditate for you all.

00:25:59.851 --> 00:26:02.102
I better start doing that again.

00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:04.018
Otherwise you have no time to meditate.

00:26:04.227 --> 00:26:07.560
So at least let Me meditate for your sake.

00:26:07.851 --> 00:26:10.352
So everyone must today promise to Me

00:26:10.559 --> 00:26:14.643
that they will meditate every day.

00:26:14.935 --> 00:26:17.893
Get up in the morning!

00:26:19.559 --> 00:26:20.643
"We can't get up in the morning."

00:26:20.851 --> 00:26:24.559
The whole world can get up, why not the English?

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:27.601
But when it was the war of Waterloo,

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:30.477
they were the first to arrive there.

00:26:30.726 --> 00:26:34.726
They won the war because they were so punctual.

00:26:34.977 --> 00:26:38.851
What has happened to their punctuality today?

00:26:46.185 --> 00:26:50.519
We are not drinking, we do not have hangovers,

00:26:50.726 --> 00:26:54.143
we don't sleep late,

00:26:54.435 --> 00:26:56.768
so why shouldn't we decide today

00:26:57.018 --> 00:27:01.810
that, "Every morning I'll get up and do my meditation.

00:27:02.102 --> 00:27:07.810
And while meditating I must concentrate on myself and not on others.

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:10.726
And see for myself what is catching,

00:27:10.935 --> 00:27:12.935
where am I catching, which chakra I am catching,

00:27:13.185 --> 00:27:15.394
what have I to do?"

00:27:15.643 --> 00:27:18.060
So on this day of Navaratri,

00:27:18.352 --> 00:27:21.227
today as the first day,

00:27:21.559 --> 00:27:28.102
the Gauri's power must be enlightened within us, and they must express.

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:33.851
And they are tremendous. I cannot describe them in one lecture.

00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:38.310
Think of the Primordial Kundalini.

00:27:38.559 --> 00:27:40.018
She acts in the Mother Earth,

00:27:40.227 --> 00:27:42.559
She acts in the universe,

00:27:42.851 --> 00:27:45.352
She acts in the animals,

00:27:45.559 --> 00:27:48.685
She acts in the matter,

00:27:48.893 --> 00:27:51.352
She acts in the human beings,

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:55.477
and now She acts in you.

00:27:58.352 --> 00:28:01.601
She is the One who decides

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:05.310
the face and the figure that you are going to have.

00:28:05.559 --> 00:28:09.269
She is the One who decides what child you should have.

00:28:09.519 --> 00:28:10.477
She is the One

00:28:10.643 --> 00:28:15.560
who gives you the particular type of a child that you need.

00:28:15.851 --> 00:28:20.477
She is the One who has got you all these beautiful children.

00:28:20.726 --> 00:28:21.559
She is the One

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:26.102
who has given you these sparkling faces and sparkling eyes.

00:28:26.394 --> 00:28:29.185
All this She has done for you,

00:28:29.477 --> 00:28:34.185
but what about the Power that you have within yourself.

00:28:34.477 --> 00:28:37.143
How much have you manifested that?

00:28:37.435 --> 00:28:40.185
The Primordial is working very hard, no doubt.

00:28:40.477 --> 00:28:42.685
But what about you, the individuals,

00:28:42.977 --> 00:28:45.643
who have got their own Kundalini awakened?

00:28:45.935 --> 00:28:49.560
How far you have opened Her out.

00:28:49.935 --> 00:28:53.060
And what is Kundalini, is a simple thing as you know.

00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:56.060
Is the true desire.

00:28:56.269 --> 00:28:59.227
So true desire to perfect yourself, to grow yourself.

00:28:59.435 --> 00:29:04.435
If it is really true desire, nothing else is important.

00:29:09.519 --> 00:29:13.435
All other desires are secondary and tertiary.

00:29:13.685 --> 00:29:16.935
The most important desire is to grow.

00:29:17.227 --> 00:29:20.935
And for whose advantage ? Is the advantage of yours

00:29:21.185 --> 00:29:25.601
and in your advantage only, the advantage of the whole world rests.

00:29:25.851 --> 00:29:31.310
Sahaja Yogis today represent the growth of this universe,

00:29:31.559 --> 00:29:35.310
the growth of the human race.

00:29:35.601 --> 00:29:37.352
Do you follow this point

00:29:37.559 --> 00:29:41.559
that you are playing such an important role,

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:45.726
role at such a crucial time

00:29:46.018 --> 00:29:50.310
when the world is about to collapse?

00:29:54.102 --> 00:29:58.477
And you have great seers like William Blake,

00:29:58.726 --> 00:30:03.559
you had such great people who have talked about this time.

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:07.810
They have built it up, traditionally we have built up all this -

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:11.685
now, in England.

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:20.060
The work of ages that has brought this England to gestate...

00:30:20.352 --> 00:30:25.643
Now, do you realize

00:30:25.935 --> 00:30:32.227
that the position of English Sahaja Yogis is very important.

00:30:36.768 --> 00:30:43.143
But lack of wisdom and bumptiousness

00:30:43.477 --> 00:30:49.227
without understanding your Self,

00:30:49.477 --> 00:30:54.519
how can you talk so loud?

00:30:54.726 --> 00:30:59.935
How can you think of organizing everything

00:31:00.227 --> 00:31:05.977
when you yourself are so weak, so bumptious?

00:31:08.143 --> 00:31:12.768
So today I am not going to take the count of the people,

00:31:13.018 --> 00:31:16.477
who meditate every day or not.

00:31:16.726 --> 00:31:17.977
But I can tell you this much,

00:31:18.185 --> 00:31:22.519
next year those who do not meditate everyday,

00:31:22.768 --> 00:31:25.435
you will not be here anymore.

00:31:25.685 --> 00:31:28.726
Take it from Me.

00:31:29.559 --> 00:31:32.643
Is a fact.

00:31:33.227 --> 00:31:37.977
Every day you must meditate.

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:40.227
Discipline yourself.

00:31:40.435 --> 00:31:45.559
Now you have come to a new perspection, perspective.

00:31:45.768 --> 00:31:47.519
You have come to a new vision.

00:31:47.768 --> 00:31:52.768
Now when you see that vision, when you know the vision,

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:55.935
you cannot just stand there.

00:31:56.227 --> 00:31:59.269
Get into it!

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:13.143
Everyone says, Damle was saying too, everybody says

00:32:13.394 --> 00:32:18.559
that, "Mother you have spent so much time for these English.

00:32:19.102 --> 00:32:22.143
Why so much time for them?"

00:32:29.935 --> 00:32:34.060
Maybe you might be thinking that because you are very great,

00:32:34.269 --> 00:32:37.060
that's why I have to serve you people.

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:40.559
Think the way you like.

00:32:41.768 --> 00:32:46.935
But the most important thing is that you are on the land of Heart,

00:32:47.227 --> 00:32:52.018
and I have to cleanse you more, much more than others.

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:56.269
But it's just the other way round. Others are going so fast.

00:32:56.559 --> 00:33:01.477
I am amazed, their vibrations, their sensitivity, their understanding.

00:33:01.643 --> 00:33:06.977
And they have just mastered it; every one of them.

00:33:08.643 --> 00:33:13.935
Here, it is becoming a very centralized stuff

00:33:14.143 --> 00:33:16.935
and everybody doesn't want to understand Sahaja Yoga,

00:33:17.185 --> 00:33:21.018
but everyone wants to give a lecture.

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:26.060
There is no respect for elders.

00:33:28.477 --> 00:33:32.685
No respect who is older who is younger,

00:33:32.977 --> 00:33:34.559
and somebody who thinks that

00:33:34.768 --> 00:33:38.102
because they got Realization before others they are higher,

00:33:38.352 --> 00:33:44.810
then remember one word of Christ, that, "First will be the last."

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:52.477
So try to understand that it is you who has to grow,

00:33:52.726 --> 00:33:56.935
it is you who has to manifest these powers.

00:33:57.143 --> 00:33:58.726
Manifestation of the power,

00:33:58.977 --> 00:34:02.810
I don't know how far you have understood.

00:34:03.477 --> 00:34:06.519
When a person who has Gauri's power,

00:34:06.768 --> 00:34:09.394
as soon as he enters a hall or any place,

00:34:09.601 --> 00:34:14.601
everybody's Kundalini rises, just to salute.

00:34:23.352 --> 00:34:25.810
When you have Gauri's power

00:34:26.102 --> 00:34:31.519
then you stand out because you have that innocent,

00:34:31.726 --> 00:34:37.227
lustless, greedless, beautiful, sparkling eyes

00:34:37.519 --> 00:34:39.060
and wherever you turn your eyes,

00:34:39.352 --> 00:34:45.102
even one glance would raise the Kundalini, immediately.

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:50.018
People who suffer from cancer, suffer from this disease, that disease,

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:52.185
all can be cured in no time

00:34:52.394 --> 00:34:57.185
if you have developed only one power of Gauri.

00:35:01.185 --> 00:35:04.559
All your problems can be solved.

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:07.102
Negativity will go away

00:35:07.352 --> 00:35:12.185
and you will become like a lotus.

00:35:13.352 --> 00:35:17.643
Beautiful, fragrant,

00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:22.477
overpowering all kinds of negativity.

00:35:22.643 --> 00:35:27.643
Here it is, "That fellow just touched me

00:35:27.935 --> 00:35:31.477
and now I have become egoistical."

00:35:32.102 --> 00:35:34.601
If there is one fellow who is egoistical,

00:35:34.893 --> 00:35:38.060
he just talks to another person, the person goes egoistical.

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:40.851
I mean this is not the way to be sensitive.

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:45.601
You have to be sensitive to God and not to bad things.

00:35:45.893 --> 00:35:52.935
But we are more akin, more vulnerable to bad than to good.

00:35:55.310 --> 00:36:00.477
So the power, the power of assimilation of good,

00:36:00.726 --> 00:36:05.477
the power of emission of good,

00:36:05.685 --> 00:36:11.935
all these powers are just in your complete reach.

00:36:13.143 --> 00:36:18.269
But all this should not become a praise

00:36:18.519 --> 00:36:21.143
but should become a kind of a challenge,

00:36:21.394 --> 00:36:26.643
a kind of a beautiful curiosity

00:36:26.935 --> 00:36:30.352
and an advancement for you.

00:36:30.726 --> 00:36:34.269
But we are going down, I must tell you,

00:36:34.477 --> 00:36:37.352
we are going down in England.

00:36:37.601 --> 00:36:39.977
Because we have some funny tags,

00:36:40.269 --> 00:36:44.352
funny people who are all the time with tags.

00:36:44.601 --> 00:36:48.102
Such people will have to be warned,

00:36:48.394 --> 00:36:53.352
and later on may be declared, as these people have decided,

00:36:53.601 --> 00:36:57.310
should be declared as blacklisted.

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:02.893
It's a very sad day today for Me

00:37:03.102 --> 00:37:05.102
and that is why the whole place is filled with -

00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:07.477
I mean I had no mind to have the puja here,

00:37:07.685 --> 00:37:08.935
because I am really very sad.

00:37:09.143 --> 00:37:12.726
Because when I see the vibrations, when I see the way things are,

00:37:12.977 --> 00:37:15.768
people are just in a picnic way in England,

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:19.519
I feel so unhappy, you don't know.

00:37:23.143 --> 00:37:30.143
I have always been extremely enamored,

00:37:31.726 --> 00:37:36.559
and I have already put up a big show of appreciating your efforts.

00:37:36.851 --> 00:37:41.935
But if you see in the substance of it;

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:46.601
just see the substance, you watch within yourself.

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:51.643
Each individual should see the substance that is within us.

00:37:51.935 --> 00:37:54.685
We are worried about a friend,

00:37:54.977 --> 00:38:00.559
a fiancèe or a wife or a husband or this and that.

00:38:00.851 --> 00:38:04.185
That's not the caliber.

00:38:09.185 --> 00:38:12.519
The caliber is very low and is going down lower.

00:38:12.726 --> 00:38:15.310
That's not a good thing, is not good.

00:38:15.519 --> 00:38:20.227
If My love and compassion is spoiling you, I better pull you out of it.

00:38:20.519 --> 00:38:23.477
Because you are capable

00:38:23.685 --> 00:38:26.227
of your merits to be born in this country.

00:38:26.435 --> 00:38:29.185
You are capable of very great heights.

00:38:29.435 --> 00:38:32.185
I know that.

00:38:32.685 --> 00:38:35.643
Of very great heights, which you can achieve.

00:38:35.851 --> 00:38:39.394
But not by talking about it or thinking about it,

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:45.102
but by becoming that great power,

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:49.269
to become that power.

00:38:49.519 --> 00:38:51.601
And see the collective blessings people have

00:38:51.851 --> 00:38:55.227
and I was amazed when they told Me, they have got this blessing,

00:38:55.435 --> 00:38:56.810
they have got that blessing.

00:38:57.018 --> 00:39:01.643
I mean unlimited blessings they have got.

00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:06.394
And why can't we have that here?

00:39:06.643 --> 00:39:10.018
What's the problem with us?

00:39:10.851 --> 00:39:15.060
If we are not collective, if there is a problem between ourselves,

00:39:15.352 --> 00:39:18.685
that means there is some sort of an ego still in-between

00:39:18.893 --> 00:39:22.143
that is keeping us out.

00:39:24.601 --> 00:39:30.102
So let us now, promise within our heart

00:39:30.394 --> 00:39:33.143
that this has to go into our heart,

00:39:33.435 --> 00:39:38.935
a very deep feeling for ourselves,

00:39:39.269 --> 00:39:42.643
that by God's grace we are born at such a juncture

00:39:42.935 --> 00:39:45.768
when this thing has happened,

00:39:46.102 --> 00:39:49.394
that we are the people who are beneficiaries

00:39:49.643 --> 00:39:53.477
of the blessings of God that we have got our Realization,

00:39:53.768 --> 00:39:56.726
that we have risen so high.

00:39:57.018 --> 00:40:02.352
But now let us spread our wings, but we are cutting them down.

00:40:02.685 --> 00:40:04.559
Don't become small-minded people,

00:40:04.726 --> 00:40:07.227
worried about small, small things here and there.

00:40:07.477 --> 00:40:10.477
Nothing is important.

00:40:10.893 --> 00:40:13.768
If you see in your previous lives, you have had all kinds of foods,

00:40:13.977 --> 00:40:15.559
you have had all kinds of trips,

00:40:15.726 --> 00:40:20.477
you have done every kind of marriages, you have done every kind of

00:40:20.685 --> 00:40:24.601
other nonsensical thing that people waste time with.

00:40:24.893 --> 00:40:28.102
It's over now, finished. Now you do something new.

00:40:28.352 --> 00:40:31.893
How many people you have married in previous lives

00:40:32.143 --> 00:40:35.310
and how many houses you had in previous lives

00:40:35.559 --> 00:40:38.935
and how many pleasures you have had,

00:40:39.227 --> 00:40:42.352
finished now - finish it.

00:40:46.477 --> 00:40:50.477
This is a special time, the best time of Ritambhara

00:40:50.685 --> 00:40:54.810
where you have to grow. That's the point is, the season is that.

00:40:55.143 --> 00:40:58.768
In this season if you do not grow,

00:40:59.227 --> 00:41:01.977
you won't grow.

00:41:02.269 --> 00:41:06.018
You have to take full advantage.

00:41:06.435 --> 00:41:09.726
With full intensity

00:41:10.018 --> 00:41:12.559
you have to do Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:12.851 --> 00:41:14.935
That doesn't mean that you give up your jobs, or anything.

00:41:15.143 --> 00:41:18.559
If you are intense in Sahaja Yoga, you will be intense in everything.

00:41:18.768 --> 00:41:21.435
But there is no intensity.

00:41:21.643 --> 00:41:23.227
Munich I decided just,

00:41:23.519 --> 00:41:26.143
I don't know if Warren has told you - Munich

00:41:26.435 --> 00:41:27.935
"You didn't tell them about Munich?"

00:41:28.269 --> 00:41:31.310
All right - Munich. I decided last minute,

00:41:31.559 --> 00:41:32.601
because there was a horrid one

00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:35.060
who had come from Munich and had told Me

00:41:35.269 --> 00:41:39.435
that Munich's seekers will ask such questions.

00:41:39.726 --> 00:41:41.394
I didn't like them at all. She was very arrogant.

00:41:41.559 --> 00:41:43.060
I said I am not going to Munich.

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:47.601
But in Vienna I just felt the vibrations of Munich.

00:41:47.893 --> 00:41:51.560
And I was amazed. I said, "All right, I am going to Munich."

00:41:51.851 --> 00:41:53.726
We had to run up and down to get My visa,

00:41:53.935 --> 00:41:57.977
this thing. Everything worked out, as usual.

00:41:58.352 --> 00:42:01.685
And in that short time, three days,

00:42:01.935 --> 00:42:04.018
four hundred people were there.

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:09.810
And so intense, I tell you, so intense, even children, so intense,

00:42:10.102 --> 00:42:14.102
and they were listening to every word I was saying,

00:42:14.352 --> 00:42:17.227
and picking up as pearls,

00:42:17.477 --> 00:42:19.810
precious as diamonds,

00:42:20.018 --> 00:42:23.768
every word they were noting it down.

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:27.643
And when they had their Realization they were just stunned people.

00:42:27.935 --> 00:42:31.601
Imagine the Germans, coming over you people, English.

00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:34.851
What will happen to you?

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:38.352
They are people of determination.

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:42.851
If they decide to do good, they'll do lot of good.

00:42:43.102 --> 00:42:45.893
They are not like this.

00:42:46.185 --> 00:42:48.310
And then when I left them,

00:42:48.559 --> 00:42:52.310
for one hour they were in the hall, just stunned,

00:42:52.601 --> 00:42:55.768
discussing about Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:00.227 --> 00:43:02.977
But here as soon as I go away,

00:43:03.185 --> 00:43:05.685
people start discussing something so nonsensical.

00:43:05.977 --> 00:43:09.477
I hear it. I know the vibrations and everything.

00:43:09.685 --> 00:43:13.977
We are not intense, we must increase our intensity.

00:43:14.227 --> 00:43:17.893
That is what is called as Shraddha.

00:43:19.685 --> 00:43:23.977
Is important, very important.

00:43:25.559 --> 00:43:31.643
And I am sure this year you will make it a point

00:43:31.977 --> 00:43:37.185
to do intense understanding of Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:38.519 --> 00:43:41.601
That intensity is lacking.

00:43:42.018 --> 00:43:46.185
May be there is something gone wrong with you in the past

00:43:46.477 --> 00:43:50.018
and you are conditioned about it, or you think about it.

00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:53.726
How can I do it, it is too much.

00:43:53.977 --> 00:43:58.977
You can do it, everything, you forget the past, forget the past.

00:43:59.269 --> 00:44:03.726
Past has no meaning whatsoever in Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:06.559 --> 00:44:09.310
You are being completely renovated

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:13.102
but just use your mechanism.

00:44:13.394 --> 00:44:14.935
I have worked so hard with you people

00:44:15.143 --> 00:44:17.435
that nothing wrong with your mechanism.

00:44:17.685 --> 00:44:21.559
Only thing you have no faith in yourself.

00:44:22.185 --> 00:44:23.851
And those who do not have faith in themselves

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:27.185
are always bumptious people.

00:44:27.893 --> 00:44:33.060
So first of all station yourself within your Spirit,

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:38.893
within your heart and try to develop your powers,

00:44:39.185 --> 00:44:42.102
inner powers, not of talking and showing off,

00:44:42.310 --> 00:44:45.352
but inner powers.

00:44:50.394 --> 00:44:54.269
Still so many are possessed, you know that.

00:44:54.559 --> 00:44:57.143
It's a shameful thing

00:44:57.352 --> 00:45:00.810
that even now in the temple of God there are people

00:45:01.102 --> 00:45:05.685
who are possessed by horrible evil things.

00:45:05.935 --> 00:45:08.685
How can it be?

00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:14.768
You are the carrier of all these, even now, how can it be?

00:45:19.018 --> 00:45:22.269
So one has to be very intensely there,

00:45:22.559 --> 00:45:24.935
and those today who are looking to be nothing,

00:45:25.143 --> 00:45:27.477
will grow into something so great,

00:45:27.643 --> 00:45:30.310
that you will be amazed at yourself.

00:45:30.559 --> 00:45:34.185
"How is it I have become so great?"

00:45:34.519 --> 00:45:39.269
But the first and foremost thing is disciplining.

00:45:40.893 --> 00:45:43.643
Discipline yourself.

00:45:43.893 --> 00:45:46.352
When it comes to eating, some people eat too much.

00:45:46.601 --> 00:45:49.477
When it comes to talking, some people talk too much.

00:45:49.685 --> 00:45:53.310
Or they do not talk at all, or they eat not at all.

00:45:53.559 --> 00:45:55.685
All this is indiscipline.

00:45:55.977 --> 00:45:59.102
But going higher to this spiritual life,

00:45:59.394 --> 00:46:02.102
best thing is to take the discipline from your Spirit

00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:04.310
and you are disciplined automatically.

00:46:04.559 --> 00:46:08.018
Let the Spirit rule you.

00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:12.726
It's possible. It's possible,

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:15.227
because I have seen in such a short time

00:46:15.477 --> 00:46:19.768
and when I have been there for such a short time,

00:46:20.018 --> 00:46:22.185
I don't even know their names.

00:46:22.477 --> 00:46:24.559
Here practically I know all of you,

00:46:24.768 --> 00:46:28.851
by your names, and by your vibrations also.

00:46:29.185 --> 00:46:32.726
And they have gone up so much.

00:46:33.726 --> 00:46:36.060
So, today is a great day.

00:46:36.352 --> 00:46:38.685
Of course a great privilege.

00:46:38.977 --> 00:46:44.352
Always you are privileged people, like House of Lords.

00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:46.601
Is true, but may be,

00:46:46.893 --> 00:46:51.810
one day may come when this House of Lords may be banished completely.

00:46:52.102 --> 00:46:55.477
You have to behave like lords.

00:46:58.143 --> 00:47:01.601
That is why My humble request is

00:47:01.851 --> 00:47:05.060
that you must learn

00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:08.559
to worship discipline.

00:47:08.893 --> 00:47:10.893
I don't say, "Do this, do that."

00:47:11.185 --> 00:47:13.435
You know what is to be done.

00:47:13.601 --> 00:47:15.559
And then on top of that, you should not tell Me,

00:47:15.726 --> 00:47:18.726
"I know, I should have, I know."

00:47:18.977 --> 00:47:23.851
When you know, why don't you do it? You are empowered.

00:47:24.143 --> 00:47:28.601
Today let us, with full confidence in ourselves

00:47:28.893 --> 00:47:30.560
and in our ascent,

00:47:30.851 --> 00:47:34.394
let us with full intensity attend this Puja

00:47:34.643 --> 00:47:36.519
and in our hearts decide

00:47:36.768 --> 00:47:40.477
that, "I am going to discipline myself."

00:47:44.394 --> 00:47:48.143
May God bless you.
