00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:22.300
It was really nice to have this seminar organized here at such a short notice with no proper planning or anything and you got such a nice place also spontaneously the whole thing has worked out and everything is managed.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:48.300
But today you saw the new people who came where an example of the dearth of seeking in this country or maybe there is some sort of lacking on the part of English Sahaja Yogi's also.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:01:07.300
The way that because I'm here people take things for granted or maybe that there are few like Gavine and others are very anxious trying to do their level best to do this.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:22.300
And I think on two points might be we are failing. One point is that we all must know what have we done for Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:43.300
Some people take two or three posters and post them then they think they have done everything. No. You have to do much more than anywhere else because you are placed in this important thing called the heart.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:02:02.300
Everybody has had an advantage of Sahaja Yoga has been helped a lot. We have to think what have we done for Sahaja Yoga. It has done so much for us what have we done for Sahaja Yoga. That's very important.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:17.300
So then there should be I think I was expressing that anxiety which the people who are your leaders and those who are worried about Sahaja Yoga in England.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:35.300
And my lecture, the whole lecture has that tremendous concern and then we have to think what have we done. We have houses, we have places, we have ashrams, we have families, we have wives, we have everything.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:48.300
The Sahaja Yoga still if it is by the way then this is the result you get twenty nonsensical arrogant people. You don't get realization some of them get it and get out.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:03:09.300
So I think this is on one side is this that what have we done for Sahaja Yoga. There should be in other countries I am not there. So for them when I go there even for four, five days the whole place is filled with my posters, the whole place.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:34.300
It has to be done every time I speak. The whole of London should have been today filled with my posters. I mean anybody who goes to say Switzerland or to Rome or to Paris they tell me Indians that we saw your posters all over the place but never has happened in London.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:04:02.300
Now I hope this is not the last program, public program in England but still one has to work very hard. All of you should think what you can do because everybody has taken things in their own style like the leaders are worried, they are working hard, they are all trying to do things and arrange things, all that.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:17.300
But what have you done is the point. Now some people have had failures say for example some people had failures with the officials and with the government or with the TV. Doesn't matter we know we have failed there.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:32.300
But advertising, post-train, talking about it, going around it, all that can be done. This one part is very good in this respect is that outside London things are working out better.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:42.300
But how many of you have been doing that? Very few. The same party goes here, same party has to do it all the time.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:05:02.300
Now this is one side of the picture is that the advertising and all that has to be done more intensely extensively. And everybody must offer their full support and services.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:20.300
On the seminar side you are all very good, everything is done well, I agree. So many things are, because we have to do so many things together. But still you are being the heart, you have to be like that, what can you do?

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:49.300
That's one part of it. The second part of it I feel is, like we had in Hamstead about 300 people and they came and what I have learnt is that when they came to the program nobody was sort of open hearted, sort of talked to them in that way as they should have. Some of you did, but not all. Most of you are just sitting down.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:06:07.300
Like if they come to my house they'll just sit down, put hands like this. You cannot. You cannot just do that, it's not done. Come to my house, sit down like this. Always they will come and sit down and put hands like this.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:22.300
You can't do like that. That shows you are very insular, very selfish and also in a way arrogant. You cannot take my vibrations without my permission, can you?

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:43.300
So this is suggestive of one thing, that what we do is to take things for granted and when we talk to others also it takes time for an Englishman to get up. That's the thing is.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:57.300
Now the quality of this is this, that in English do not want to interfere with anyone. They want to leave them alone. It's not the bad thing. They want that why should we interfere, aggress. That's the point.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:11.300
But that's not the point now. We have to aggress. This is the thing I'm bringing you to. That means you don't mean that. But what you mean is that not to interfere. See they don't discuss religion in England.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:26.300
You are not supposed to say these things. You are not to discuss whether you are a miss or a missus. You are not to say whether you have children or not. If you ask somebody a question, you have you got children. That means the most offensive thing.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:41.300
You are not to discuss anybody's family. There are so many don'ts in this country so that we do not also sort of get up worried that maybe this may be taken as an interference.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:52.300
But just opposite are Americans. They will go up to the great grandfather and up to the whole progeny to find out.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:08:06.300
So interference should be forgotten. There should be no fear about them. But open your heart and talk to them openly with an open heart. But people receive back.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:19.300
Once they receive back, others also somehow or other get frightened. Because they think you are just like them. You have to be different to attract them.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:32.300
So amongst English Sahaja Yogis there are some who are very anxious, very much worried that being so much working it out. Some of them are really indifferent.

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:45.300
And the middle part is those who are still trying to see how far to go, how far not to go, you have to be aggressive about it.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:58.300
I mean as if now I feel the English have aggressed so much that now they are so fed up with aggressiveness. That's the thing I want you to have today, to be aggressive.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:07.300
Aggressiveness is the only way you can reach these people, otherwise they won't understand. And you have to talk to them on their faces.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:22.300
I have seen how people talk. If you talk to them like that they are alright. Unless and until you work out that way when the people come, you talk to them in an aggressively loving manner. Do you understand that?

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:32.300
Exuberance. Just open out your heart. How come long, come long, where are you going, sit down, what do you want, you want.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:39.300
One minute English one will look like this, you see. Second minute.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:51.300
You must understand your own character that exists in those people also. The language starts, I am afraid.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:10:04.300
So aggressively compassionate, aggressively loving, aggressively open hearted.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:11.300
Non-interference and all those ideas are out of date now, finished.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:24.300
Now openness, no arrogance, no anger but openness.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:37.300
Aggressive innocence people, like children are. Children are so aggressively innocent that you like it.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:45.300
I mean if they catch hold of you they will all come and jump on your body and sleep on top of you.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:11:01.300
Kissing you all over. That's how. You have to be aggressively loving and aggressively good. What you want, you want something to eat, you want this, that, that.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:09.300
They will be surprised how these English people have become like this. So on these two things we fail.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:19.300
And this anguish and this anxiety that I have is one of the expressions of the modern times, that's known.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:26.300
It's of the modern times, you see. Because modern times are so funny that if you click it, you click it.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:32.300
And if you don't click it, you missed. It's so important. So precarious is the word. So precarious.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:37.300
At this time if you don't click it, it's finished.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:45.300
So I find everyone is capable of doing lots of things for Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:52.300
But what have we done for Sahaja Yoga? Nice in the seminar, a common enjoy is good ideal.

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:56.300
Enjoy Sahaja Yogis, Mother is collecting them.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:03.300
One of the examples is that from the other countries people come.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.300
They are sick, they have problems, they are dying.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:17.300
Immediately telephone will ring, we are saying, Mother somebody has come with ten boots and fifteen baboots.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:27.300
So what? When should that person see you? I said, the person or the boots?

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:35.300
And the boots only come. The person is missing.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:44.300
At least you can reduce some numbers and then send such a person.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:50.300
Now I started using the hearth of my house instead of the candle.

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:58.300
Now will you please look after the boots of the people when they come.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:05.300
And among you are there are many like that. Your children are caught up, some of the wives are caught up,

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:13.300
some of the husbands are caught up. But nobody pays attention, carrying on with them.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:21.300
Sometimes even supporting. And just I see them even staying in ashrams I must say,

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:26.300
some of them are really Bhutish and troublesome.

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:34.300
And you think that you have to tolerate this no crucifixion needed anymore.

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:38.300
If somebody has a boot, better tell that person you are catching.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:42.300
I mean I don't want to tell. But you know what happens to me?

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:48.300
My hands and my feet they all go crazy. And there's a Bhutish person around.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:53.300
So I just run away. In the same way it should happen to you.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:57.300
And you should try to correct that person. But nobody but the Mother.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:01.300
You see because you think correction will be too much.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:06.300
Oh, maybe he might feel hurt and he run away. Let him run away.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:15.300
Take two running jumps and go to hell. But the whole thing should be a concern and anxiety and loving way.

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:22.300
Then you will attract that person. I mean today I was really so full of vibrations.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:28.300
Nothing would be sucked in. These horrible twenty people or whosoever they were.

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:35.300
They were stopping you also from sucking me. I mean they were more powerful than you are in your suction I think.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:42.300
So now there's something wrong with us. What is that wrong is what have we done for Sahaja Yoga, for Sahaja Yoga?

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:47.300
Second is what am I doing about myself? Where am I?

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:52.300
Nice to ask a question. What's the difference between a God realized and a Self realized?

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.300
God realized never catches.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:16.300
Just knows. Now why do I feel horrible? Only with Sahaja Yogis, not with non Sahaja Yogis.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:21.300
Even Narakasura comes before me, I can kill him.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:28.300
But Sahaja Yogis are inside my body, what am I to do? They are part and parcel of me, they are not foreigners.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:34.300
So when they get sick I get sick myself because they are inside myself. No deity has done that.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:42.300
No incarnation has done that job. Nobody has injected Sahaja Yogis inside their body.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:49.300
Has anyone done that way? You are all inside my body, part and parcel.

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:57.300
When something goes wrong with you, it goes wrong with me inside. Naturally if I take it, it's in discriminate you can say.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:06.300
But if I were not in discriminate, how many would have gone inside my body? That's how I can cleanse you.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:10.300
I can look after you, I can know about your workout things very well.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:20.300
Something happens to someone in Australia, I can work it out here because he is in my body.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:31.300
That's why I get sick. I can say I get caught up. Because I've got boots within me.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:38.300
So you must keep out your boots. This is the third point, very important. How can I have boots in me?

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:48.300
How can I have left side or right side or anything? I am in the body of mother. Who is the Adi Shakti?

00:16:48.300 --> 00:17:00.300
What a privilege, what an honour. So now I can't have any boots within myself. It has to be something very pure.

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:09.300
So try to purify yourself, keep yourself pure. What I am saying now is for English, is for all of you.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:15.300
English being always the leaders for starting something good, I have to talk to them more.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:24.300
They have done it because they were the ones who fought the war, won it and that's how we started under tides.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:31.300
But now the instruments that we are going to use have to be that powerful.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:39.300
If Europeans among them say Brussels people come up very well, then I'll shift my attention.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:46.300
We can shift heart these days, transplant is possible.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:56.300
Have you heard of heart from right, moves to the left or left to the right?

00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:05.300
God can do it. There are people born with the heart on the right hand side also.

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:17.300
So to be very precise, I think that this seminar should be used for also having an inner insight.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:33.300
Seeing what have we done for Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:47.300
That will help. Secondly, very important is, are we open-hearted?

00:18:47.300 --> 00:19:00.300
Now for example, we can say like this, that supposing I am in the house and the bell rings up.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:06.300
If there's an American, he'll say I'll get it, he'll be the first to run.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:10.300
And English would be looking this side, that side.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:16.300
Because a kind of a lethargy that is settled in.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:24.300
Because that's the idea of the negative to freeze the heart.

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:38.300
And that freezing is to be avoided. I'll get it, I'll do it. I'll work it out.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:47.300
I have to do it. That must be told. All the English Sahaja Yogis must know that they have to be the most active people.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:57.300
Do you know, even when we sleep, when the heart is beating, all the time till we exist.

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:03.300
So I have to tell you that you bear a very big responsibility to Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:11.300
That's why I've been here, I've been with you. And that doesn't mean you should take things for granted.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:19.300
You can do a lot. You have to circulate. Maybe English Sahaja Yogis will have to travel a lot.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:34.300
But first of all, first and foremost, open your heart. Talk openly and sweetly.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:43.300
You have children, learn from them how they talk, how sweetly they move.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:55.300
Really open your heart. And less than until you open your heart, how can you do anything for anybody else?

00:20:55.300 --> 00:21:11.300
And that's what one has to achieve. I am sure next program I can see myself all over London. All right?

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:21.300
Now don't feel guilty. I am getting terrible pain.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:32.300
Don't feel guilty. Face it. Yes, it's true. Don't feel guilty about it. For heaven's sake don't feel guilty because I am now getting a terrible pain again.

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:43.300
Huh? Food is? The food is arrived. All right? So we can have some music, all right?

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:51.300
Then I'll go because tomorrow I have to come for your puja. So if you don't mind, tomorrow about eleven o'clock we'll start the puja.

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:59.300
But those who have to cancel their thing, I hope you manage that tomorrow. I bless you with that. May God bless you.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:10.300
The lunch is absolutely fixed at this place. It's twelve o'clock. They won't move one minute. One fifty. One fifty.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:22.300
We can start at ten o'clock. We can start puja at ten. I mean for me it's all right. I can even start at nine. But what about you people?

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.300
Ten minutes.

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:29.300
I can start at six. But just now.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:33.300
I mean whether we could have it after lunch it would be better.

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:43.300
No, but what about others? No, it's better to have it before. No, it's, you see actually it's this, there is, I don't know what sort of puja it is going to be because

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:49.300
see it's a Vishnu Maya's, this thing you see. So we can have a short puja of Vishnu Maya. It's all right.

00:22:49.300 --> 00:23:00.300
It has to be done in the night, no doubt, in the sense that, you know. But it doesn't matter. It's no difference.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:12.300
You can call it a global puja, some sort of a general puja, you can call it. I don't know.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:23.300
Vishnu Maya is something so powerful. All right. So let's have some music and then I'll go back.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:33.300
Just tell her not to wait for my food at home. This girl, if not she should eat her food.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:40.300
So let's see now what is the contribution. Now you have seen the music that has come from Nasi.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:55.300
What a professional music it was. Did you hear that? Now what have you to produce? Just look at that. It was a real professional thing they have done.

00:23:55.300 --> 00:24:02.300
So we should try to find out something better. All right? Now let's have some music.

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:09.300
Wow, what do you think you are going to be eating so much? All right, all right, all right.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:15.300
What is cooked in? This one. And this one.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:23.300
And that is plain gold. Plain. Plain one I'll have. And that I can have. All right?

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:30.300
I'll try to manage something. Now let's have some music.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:28.300
Okay.

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:58.300
Okay.

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:52.300
Now for India too. You see this may be there as I told you. I didn't know this year.

00:26:52.300 --> 00:27:02.300
This year or maybe next year, maybe the last year. I can't say. The reason is once we have established our ashrams in India,

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:10.300
I don't think I'll be able to take all this around all the villages and all that. Once we have ashrams they will all come down to see us there.

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:16.300
In India for them it's a pilgrimage and they go out of the way to do it.

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:27.300
So when you people are coming there, after once we have established our ashram, there won't be any of these India tours much,

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:37.300
which you have enjoyed very much. Maybe this might be the last year or next year. I don't know. Depends on as soon as we have established ashram.

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:55.300
Now I see that people do not understand the value of Indian tour also. It does not have good to you because it's a country which is heavenly,

00:27:55.300 --> 00:28:06.300
I should say, as far as vibrations are concerned. In terms of feel we are living in hell here because I see the TV on horrible things and I mean it's really terrible.

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:13.300
There are so many Indians who have come here and they say that they lose their vibrations. Not only here, America anywhere.

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:22.300
So the Indian tour, though apart from anything else itself, is visiting India is still a clearer country, especially Maharashtra.

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:37.300
Now, it's time to make it convenient. We have made it for three weeks. So you are there only for three weeks, two weeks, around, at one week, around the sea, sure.

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:51.300
Now actually we will not have many public programs. But that is something every year, if you cannot do it, at least alternate years should have been done.

00:28:51.300 --> 00:29:04.300
I find that, that people don't understand the importance of Indian tour. Ninety-nine percent people who have been to India settle down in Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:19.300
There must be something about it. So those who are going to eat, and now we have made it the minimum possible. Though everybody warned us, Warren said that it's going to be very expensive, it is ten times more, everything is there.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:35.300
Whatever minimum we have put. Luckily also Air India, because it had so many accidents, it has gone very cheap. And you people should know that if you have to go pay the money in time, you are still waiting for last minute.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:47.300
I'm going to be here for a month, I know that. But that doesn't mean that you should take so much time. It's like a pilgrimage. And everybody should try.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:58.300
Everybody should try. I cannot manage many, but quite a lot we can manage now, because we have made two tours now. In case you cannot manage the first tour, you come for the second tour.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:18.300
But it's not so difficult. But if you see, I have now noticed people quite closely that people waste their money alone. Just the other way round Indians are. You know, they keep all the money just for my tour there.

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:29.300
Keep all their holidays, all their money for the tour. Though they do not gain so much as you people gain, because it's a new world you go to.

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:42.300
So those who are coming should decide, but those who are not coming also must think it over. It's not difficult.

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:55.300
It's better. I hope this is not the last time, but maybe I can say. Because once we have an ashram, then why need not go all over there? Indians will all come from all over India, they'll come.

00:30:56.300 --> 00:31:06.300
People are already coming from Madras, even if I have a small little room, they come down. Because we have no place to make them stay, that's why. Otherwise you will be surprised, they will be all there.

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:19.300
You won't be able to see yourself there, it will be so many. Before that starts, you must understand that you have to go to India, some all over. At least once.

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:33.300
Next year or this year, you have, but I can't even promise next year, I really tell you, I must say that 90% next year we'll have the program again.

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:41.300
Because it's becoming very difficult, very difficult money wise also, and otherwise it's becoming sun-wielding.

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:52.300
So I would request you to think it over, and those who want to come should give your names. Even if you have not paid the money, you can do it because I'm here for this month.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:59.300
So those who have not yet given your names also can give your names to Gaveen, I will adjust it.

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:13.300
But I cannot make it, I mean, I wanted to make it much cheaper for you, but it's not the food that is expensive, it's the traveling. But now traveling has become much cheaper.

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:38.300
But everything is by the way, that's the cowardice, by the way. You see, if you want to save money, and people will save money to buy Rolls-Royce, which cost, I don't know how much, for that horrible fellow in one year.

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:45.300
And Sahaja Yogis can't have money to go to India, I can't believe it.

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:58.300
At least once everybody should go by gym, because it helps, helps them such a lot.

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:08.300
I myself never knew that it would help so much, but I now believe it does help.

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:18.300
So those who have not yet given money also can give their names to Gaveen, or to their leaders.

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:27.300
We'll be staying for seven days on the seashore, on a beautiful, one of the best in the whole world.

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:40.300
Vrishhti Ganesha is there, and the water of the sea comes out of his naabi, and only his lower body you can see. The head is the mountain itself.

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:47.300
You can see the lights coming out of it, only the Sahaja Yogis can see.

00:33:51.300 --> 00:34:02.300
I don't know about next year also. But it should not be a thing that is sort of a, by the way, that's important.

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:18.300
That's important. So let us see what's happening, because Australians are quite a lot coming, and we have to see about others also.

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:23.300
All right? May God bless you.

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:46.300
That's something I see. Now look at the music they have produced, the quality. Try to compete with them.

00:35:23.338 --> 00:35:29.300
Just think of it. And I know he got his Realisation only last year.

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:38.247
Last year this fellow got his Realisation. In one year.

00:35:47.527 --> 00:35:57.300
We have made copies of that music for you people to be given you as presents only to the leaders.

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:40.470
And drums. That will be a good idea.

01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:54.134
From Bristol.

01:07:57.810 --> 01:07:59.224
Let me see.

01:08:10.550 --> 01:08:13.105
Where is Chris Wakefield?

01:08:13.470 --> 01:08:15.470
You sent me?

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:19.720
You know, I told them it was Chris Wakefield who wrote.

01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:23.195
But they said, no, Chris Wakefield is not a writer.

01:08:23.230 --> 01:08:25.230
Another Chris is a writer.

01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:27.350
But I tell you, there's a poet.

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:29.010
Poets are not writers.

01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:30.860
That's the trouble is.

01:08:36.130 --> 01:08:37.471
Very much.

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:38.681
But what about them?

01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:40.720
Where are they?

01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:46.300
They haven't brought.

01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:48.380
Oh, I'll bring them tomorrow, I think.

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:50.640
Beautiful.

01:08:49.230 --> 01:08:51.230
But it's a real poet at it.

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:53.320
Real poet.

01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:55.380
Poetry is so great.

01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:58.843
You see, now I'll tell you one thing about poetry.

01:08:58.910 --> 01:09:06.910
In the poetry, poetry means there has to be magic in the word.

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:13.997
When you say something, it must have a magic.

01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:20.677
If there's no magic, then it's not poetry.

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:28.120
Then the second thing is that it's precise.

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:31.560
It has to be precise.

01:09:32.170 --> 01:09:36.170
It has to be small words, sentences.

01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:40.726
Like many propositions and all that are to be dropped out.

01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:44.780
Adjectives to be dropped out, meaning you are allowed.

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:50.080
So many adverbs can be dropped out.

01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:52.774
But mainly what you can drop out are articles.

01:09:52.830 --> 01:09:54.964
Absolutely.

01:09:57.230 --> 01:10:00.364
Third is that it must have rasa.

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:03.200
Rasa means the essence.

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:05.440
It must have the essence.

01:10:05.670 --> 01:10:10.963
And the essence are according to Indian science, are nine tabs.

01:10:11.330 --> 01:10:12.522
Must have any essence.

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:16.600
Now this is the essence today is of bhakti.

01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:26.780
When you are singing of bhakti and devotion, then you have to use words,

01:10:27.210 --> 01:10:36.470
extremely gentle words, gentle words, beautiful words, words that are delicate,

01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:49.420
the words that express devotion through humility, words of humility.

01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:55.860
Now what I see now with your compositions is that two types.

01:10:56.230 --> 01:11:05.306
One is addressed to others and one addressed to Me.

01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:11.380
In the others you have addressed some to the other people who are not Sahaja Yogis.

01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:19.390
Some your own Sahaja Yogis together and some are addressed to Me.

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:25.028
So there are three types of compositions you have done.

01:11:25.190 --> 01:11:32.449
Now when you are addressing to others, you need not be that delicate.

01:11:32.530 --> 01:11:38.530
Like what you say, come and see, listen, look up.

01:11:39.630 --> 01:11:42.630
This is what you should do.

01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:45.960
In a gentle way they won't understand.

01:11:46.090 --> 01:11:54.090
So you have to use words which are sort of forcing them, pushing into it.

01:11:54.130 --> 01:11:56.130
What are you doing?

01:11:56.710 --> 01:11:59.710
This is the poem, same way written down.

01:11:59.870 --> 01:12:01.165
And very good poem, no doubt.

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:07.285
But in this poem, whatever you have written, this one, is good, nice and everything fine.

01:12:07.370 --> 01:12:15.370
But what I find is still a little bit diplomacy.

01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:21.460
Now if you say how many of you want to be saved today, they'll say all of us.

01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:22.510
How do you count?

01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:26.540
How do you find out?

01:12:26.590 --> 01:12:36.590
So the question should be asked in a way in reality, in totality.

01:12:36.610 --> 01:12:43.893
Actually, honestly, put these adjectives in between so that then people understand

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:48.920
honestly, are we honest?

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:51.494
But they'll also be, we all want to seek.

01:12:51.530 --> 01:12:55.530
We are all sick as you are sick as you are sick as, why should we run after Mother?

01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:57.140
All right?

01:12:57.260 --> 01:13:09.577
So honestly, and all those things sort of, you see, make it look more objective.

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:10.600
You fix them.

01:13:10.650 --> 01:13:11.650
You hem them up.

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:14.280
Otherwise they'll slip out.

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:20.360
In whatever you're seeing, it should be such that they are pushed into a point, they have

01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:21.782
no escapes left.

01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:27.820
So when you write now, next time, that's a very good poetry, no doubt, but correct it

01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:30.062
when you address to others.

01:13:30.090 --> 01:13:37.090
See that they have no escape.

01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:39.300
That they cannot bhaja.

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:40.360
All right, Vivaan?

01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:46.823
You are a scholar, so I must ask you permission.

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:53.240
Now, the second one is when we are singing among ourselves.

01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:58.127
Now, the thing that is joy, joy is a very good one.

01:13:58.210 --> 01:14:02.210
But we are not addressing to folk people.

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:04.640
That's the point.

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:08.637
We are addressing to intellectuals.

01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:12.317
So that's a good one between ourselves when we sing.

01:14:12.370 --> 01:14:17.370
We have to address to the intellectuals so we can challenge relatives.

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:19.797
You say, what have they got?

01:14:19.930 --> 01:14:21.557
With the intellect, what did I get?

01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:23.153
With this, I what did I get?

01:14:23.223 --> 01:14:27.993
All these barren things, useless things, you've found nothing, not a single friend.

01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:32.060
And then come down what I got in search of.

01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:37.360
This relative description should be given.

01:14:37.410 --> 01:14:41.410
So I hope some of you will write poetry on that.

01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:49.455
The third one is what Wakefield has done, is my description and devotion to you.

01:14:49.630 --> 01:14:52.630
Come out, Bhairebaal, I must say.

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:55.040
I think that's the highest one can do.

01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:56.961
That's the best.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000
But still we need all this, we have to have.

01:15:00.030 --> 01:15:02.030
Otherwise we cannot manage.

01:15:02.050 --> 01:15:04.050
So that's a part of it.

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:22.120
But the essence of it, the praise, where many great poets, many great writers, many great saints and incarnations

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:26.160
have aspired to sing the praise of the Mother.

01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:29.200
It's a great aspiration.

01:15:29.210 --> 01:15:31.210
Like Markandeya did that.

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:34.260
Today also we did it after fourteen thousand years.

01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:38.390
Then Adi Shankaracharya did that.

01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:41.766
So poetry of that level should come out.

01:15:41.850 --> 01:15:49.850
I would request you to read those poems, poetry of those people who compose such high class books

01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:53.920
that not a word can be changed, not to be added.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
And that's how you try to perfect it.

01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:58.560
Try to perfect it.

01:15:58.650 --> 01:16:03.650
When you have written it down, sit down, think over it, again try to bring in better words.

01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:05.194
Try to put better words.

01:16:05.210 --> 01:16:09.210
So you actually make it a perfect poetry, a perfect setting.

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:12.320
That's it.

01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:14.700
But a poet is a poet born poet.

01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:19.145
It's a thing that is born and even after Sahaja Yoga many people suddenly become poets.

01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:24.220
Like Damle never used to, he's an engineer, never is to write but wrote very well.

01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:25.340
Very beautifully.

01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:27.765
Poems are very good even now I think he's very good.

01:16:27.770 --> 01:16:30.770
But there was another fellow, Kade, who did beautiful writing.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:34.253
I don't know where are his poems lost but they are somewhere.

01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:38.280
And such tremendous things he has written.

01:16:38.370 --> 01:16:39.370
I was amazed.

01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:43.163
But he said, I don't write, the Saraswati is writing in me.

01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:52.220
So for that you see, the spontaneity is alright but you have to have the technique to write.

01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:56.542
The technique must be there and the spontaneity I'll look after.

01:16:56.580 --> 01:17:00.580
So you have to also develop a little bit of technique how to write it out.

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:03.600
In these three categories you write of different type.

01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:10.780
So when you write about your mother, you have to be absolutely sure.

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:19.393
Absolutely one and absolutely surrendered.

01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:28.280
So the whole thing can be an epic, absolutely the top most thing that one can do in poetry

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:32.080
is to write the praise of the Mother.

01:17:32.150 --> 01:17:33.150
That's the highest.

01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:42.114
So all the poetry is very nice, comes out of very generous heart and also very great hearts.

01:17:42.170 --> 01:17:44.170
But it has to have a technique.

01:17:44.610 --> 01:17:57.610
And the technique is to be little bit understood in a divine way that what makes it a thing

01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:03.640
that throbs in your heart.

01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:10.362
So that you will see yourself that will throb in your heart.

01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:14.440
If you are detached about it you will do it and you will do it very well.

01:18:14.490 --> 01:18:16.490
I was so happy about Chris's.

01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:19.312
I told them it is Chris Wakeful who has written to me.

01:18:19.370 --> 01:18:22.370
They thought that it is Chris who has done this from Bristol.

01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:26.400
So I said alright let me ask first of all Chris from Bristol.

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:30.120
Beautiful poetry, beautiful is done.

01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:36.180
Alright, so best of luck to you for all these good poems and poetry that you have done

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:40.078
and all these pieces are extremely beautiful.

01:18:40.090 --> 01:18:50.090
But we have to perfect it, make it better and better and in tune with divine vibrations.

01:18:50.498 --> 01:18:53.724
So you should say vibrations also.

01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:56.424
What gives you the best vibrations?

01:18:56.500 --> 01:19:02.154
Tunes could be simple, could be complicated, could be magical, could be anything.

01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:15.280
But the poetry must not narrate but create magic.

01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:25.112
Sanskrit really says when it is there is a magic, the light of the magic.

01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:29.954
When there is a light of the magic then you should call it the poetry.

01:19:31.630 --> 01:19:34.304
When there is a rasa then there is kave, there is poetry.

01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:40.988
Otherwise no, without rasa there is no.

01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:44.548
Now this is the part where the composer is concerned.

01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:52.600
Now for the part of the ones who have to sing, to sing from your heart.

01:19:52.750 --> 01:19:56.318
Knowing before whom you are singing, from your heart.

01:19:56.350 --> 01:20:01.350
You are not singing for yourself, you are singing for me, singing for the whole universe.

01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:09.824
Say it from your heart knowing that I am before you, understanding that.

01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:14.990
Secondly you must have the technique of singing it, it is very important.

01:20:15.790 --> 01:20:24.174
All these techniques are built in through tradition by understanding whatever is not proper is thrown away.

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:30.240
It should not be that one line close, long, another line comes short, long.

01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:34.590
There should be a proper technique about it, how to do it.

01:20:34.820 --> 01:20:38.820
See like a free verse business is no good for Sahaja Yoga.

01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:44.020
So that technique you have to know how to sing it with that the music.

01:20:44.050 --> 01:20:52.380
But the drum is an essential part of every music because that is the part where Anahata is placed.

01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:55.470
So in sound drum has to be there.

01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:59.510
When you are singing there has to be drum as well as other accompaniments.

01:20:59.850 --> 01:21:05.850
Any accompaniments you have but drum is an essential part that has to be there.

01:21:05.870 --> 01:21:10.870
And the whole thing should be on a rhythmic understanding that you see,

01:21:10.890 --> 01:21:14.298
you have seen how Indians have a rhythmic understanding you see.

01:21:14.350 --> 01:21:19.350
They cut it into three halves, four halves, they bring it back and how they cut it, how they go off beat.

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:27.640
It's really too much but you can compose to a great extent on those lines.

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:36.050
And that technique has to come properly understood.

01:21:36.190 --> 01:21:42.297
Like singing in parts itself is a big technique and one has to understand how you do it.

01:21:42.370 --> 01:21:46.370
But there are so many other things which you have is tremor, you have yoddling.

01:21:46.810 --> 01:21:51.810
I don't know if you are used those things or not at all but you should use in music.

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:58.372
There are so many things you have which all of these things you should use which helps a lot in music.

01:21:58.420 --> 01:22:03.420
I don't know much about western music but whatever I am.

01:22:03.610 --> 01:22:09.912
And these things if you use it will help a lot to bring out the music in its proper way.

01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:13.950
And I don't know if you have any sopranos singers also.

01:22:14.450 --> 01:22:18.450
And the way they sing beautifully you have to have some of them.

01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:21.660
So in between a soprano singer can sing in between.

01:22:21.710 --> 01:22:27.710
But should be made a proper, sensible, organized thing.

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:34.436
Because to the public they can't understand this.

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:37.296
And another could be hippy style of music.

01:22:37.330 --> 01:22:38.330
I don't mind even that.

01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:39.580
It's alright.

01:22:39.630 --> 01:22:47.258
But if it is sung with the heart, with that devotion, like a folklor, it will be very good.

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:54.360
But should be so fast and so accurate and so clear cut that people should feel this is something so great.

01:22:54.370 --> 01:23:00.370
So you can have all varieties, you can have classical style, you can have this yoddling style.

01:23:04.055 --> 01:23:08.447
And then you can have, you have many styles you can sing like that.

01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:09.677
We too have.

01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:17.720
Like for the tapes you have heard now is we have two tapes which are absolutely folk.

01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:20.608
I don't know if you have noticed, it's a very fast number.

01:23:20.650 --> 01:23:21.650
The first one is.

01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:29.740
And the first one is about how the abstract without form, the formless has become.

01:23:30.410 --> 01:23:33.608
Has appeared now into form.

01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:36.397
The first one is such a fast number.

01:23:36.450 --> 01:23:38.007
So I hope you have heard it.

01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:39.040
Have you heard it clearly?

01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:41.380
Who would like to hear once again?

01:23:41.410 --> 01:23:43.410
Just play the first one.

01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:44.550
Nirguni.

01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:46.727
Nirguni is without any mistake.

01:23:46.890 --> 01:23:49.890
So now when you see, hear that, try to grasp it.

01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:53.990
I think in music Indians are very well off.

01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:55.988
No doubt about it.

01:23:56.010 --> 01:23:57.010
I mean no doubt about it.

01:23:57.180 --> 01:24:00.928
They are very well off and their rhythms and all that, they are very systematic.

01:24:00.988 --> 01:24:02.030
They know a lot.

01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:06.070
So it's a very good thing but now you listen to the first one.

01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:11.181
The one you had just now out of that the first one.

01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:31.559
Now you see the whole thing how they have based the rhythm, the music, the poetry and

01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:33.189
the combination of everyone.

01:24:33.230 --> 01:24:34.230
How they have worked it out.

01:24:34.430 --> 01:24:38.839
Just see this point for about two, three minutes it will play.

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:41.880
And it's a folk song.

01:24:42.130 --> 01:24:43.130
It's a folk thing.

01:24:43.170 --> 01:24:47.020
It's an extremely fast, fast music, folklor.

01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:51.530
Absolutely what you can call the top speed it starts.

01:24:52.230 --> 01:24:59.640
So they said Nirguni, the one who was without any gunas, without any form has appeared now

01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:03.880
on the scene to give us realization.

01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:09.770
It's such a speed but it conveys and communicates the thing.

01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:18.790
Just after when they have said it that this is the thing.

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:26.157
Only listen to one and you will understand.

01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:29.447
Just put it little forward.

01:25:29.610 --> 01:25:33.610
Little forward than this.

01:25:33.970 --> 01:25:36.227
Now that's all.

01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:37.310
Now start it.

01:25:37.770 --> 01:25:38.797
No, no, not this one.

01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:39.870
The other way.

01:25:39.930 --> 01:25:45.034
Just on the other side, on the other side.

01:25:54.270 --> 01:25:56.190
That's a folklore, just an ordinary.

01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:58.830
Now you also catch hold of your folk lores here.

01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:01.200
Must be very fast, I'm sure.

01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:05.070
Get hold of your folk lores and their tunes and set into that.

01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:06.660
That's the best way to do it.

01:26:06.688 --> 01:26:09.050
They can be very fast.

01:26:09.090 --> 01:26:13.023
This is just a folklore and a folk style called Launi.

01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:14.160
On that it is best.

01:26:14.250 --> 01:26:18.610
It's very fast.

01:26:18.710 --> 01:26:20.830
This is the first one.

01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:24.153
In this one the first.

01:26:26.310 --> 01:26:31.230
Now just listen to it and you will understand what I'm saying.

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:34.320
That's an example I feel.

01:26:35.530 --> 01:26:39.771
The poetry is very high class, very high class poetry.

01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:42.231
The style is folk.

01:27:12.970 --> 01:27:16.071
It's the first one and then you stop it.

01:27:26.701 --> 01:27:32.174
You see that the one you brought is no good compared to what he was.

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:34.480
Doesn't that know?

01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:36.820
It's nothing, nothing compared to that.

01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:41.000
That day he was in a different mood.

01:29:14.260 --> 01:29:16.878
He was too tight together.

01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:22.448
And what will I have is the enlightened awareness.

01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:31.989
It's a colloquial but yoga.

01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:35.140
It's a village or yoga.

01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:37.200
I'll ask her for yoga.

01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:50.260
Now they have changed the tune you see.

01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:58.838
I will spend nine nights in her bhakti.

01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:13.568
My father-in-law is the banditly.

01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:15.428
I'll give you ma.

01:30:27.270 --> 01:30:30.477
It's a woman's song.

01:30:30.877 --> 01:30:35.517
She says my father-in-law is the variety and my husband is the ego.

01:30:35.630 --> 01:30:39.630
I'll give them up.

01:30:39.710 --> 01:30:44.674
What is with him?

01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:47.234
Both are the enlightened awareness.

01:30:47.410 --> 01:30:53.410
I'll make my flowers of that.

01:30:53.490 --> 01:31:01.490
See now.

01:31:02.010 --> 01:31:08.014
I'll kill the maisha sura.

01:31:08.430 --> 01:31:11.430
All those who are bad condition is me.

01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:20.960
I'll take them as bad eyes from my mother.

01:31:49.950 --> 01:31:58.347
I'll become unattached to everything.

01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:07.600
I've left the ego of my husband behind.

01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:14.620
I'll turn the anger.

01:32:15.020 --> 01:32:25.020
They are my relations. I've left them behind.

01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:53.148
I've asked mother for yoga and I've got it and kept it with me.

01:32:53.220 --> 01:33:08.220
Then I have given her back by spreading it all over.

01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:22.480
That is how I've got rid of all life and death cycles by giving all that back.

01:33:23.870 --> 01:33:36.870
The village style is absolutely beautiful.

01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:47.822
It's a very, very fast song with very deep penetrating poetry, very penetrating.

01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:50.692
This is how one should understand.

01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:57.750
There has to be Sahaja Yoga words, there has to be Sahaja Yoga ideas, there has to be all these things.

01:33:58.070 --> 01:34:00.057
Otherwise we have not achieved it.

01:34:00.130 --> 01:34:03.130
Even his songs are like that.

01:34:03.550 --> 01:34:05.550
Like he says Agnya Chakra.

01:34:05.590 --> 01:34:11.590
On the Agnya Chakra I've got a bundle, bundle of love.

01:34:11.630 --> 01:34:13.630
So why have you stopped?

01:34:13.650 --> 01:34:15.650
Now open my Sahasrara.

01:34:15.810 --> 01:34:17.810
Mother, open my Sahasrara.

01:34:17.850 --> 01:34:20.850
Let's talk of these things in our poetry.

01:34:21.150 --> 01:34:24.331
In English language you must talk of these things in this way.

01:34:24.370 --> 01:34:26.370
I was happy in the previous one.

01:34:26.410 --> 01:34:28.410
We talked of Sahasrara and all that.

01:34:28.451 --> 01:34:35.748
Let people know that you know more than them and that you have a deeper understanding of everything.

01:34:35.780 --> 01:34:38.780
That's how it should be brought in.

01:34:38.930 --> 01:34:40.930
So we have had very nice music.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.308
Thank you very much.

01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:46.360
Tomorrow again we are going to have the music of the puja.

01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:48.540
So may God bless you.

01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:50.116
Hope to see you again tomorrow morning.

01:34:50.150 --> 01:34:52.150
All right?

01:35:27.150 --> 01:35:29.150
There's another one. You've got not ...

01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:31.240
He's the born realized.

01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:35.360
He's done some, he's a Muslim, but this recording is not good.

01:35:35.470 --> 01:35:38.470
The other one is good. Just play a little bit more.

01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:41.540
Something is floating there.

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:45.600
Just please be seated. Five minutes more.

01:35:45.730 --> 01:35:48.730
Then he is going to get the proper recording.

01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:51.860
Music is very important in these modern times,

01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:53.910
and one has to concentrate on that.

01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:57.990
But the poetry has to be penetrating, that's the point.

01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:04.800
And by saying all these things, you see,

01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:07.820
you'll create also curiosity for Sahaja Yoga,

01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:10.910
by using these words.

01:42:35.700 --> 01:42:42.928
Short circuiting. I think all violins is due to that, all over the world.

01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:49.270
Ha, now, what's it?

01:42:53.330 --> 01:42:58.330
Anybody else here who hasn't got it, who is a new person, you got it, madam?

01:42:58.980 --> 01:43:02.980
Just see all of them, all of them. Those who are Sahaja Yogis sitting here, watch them. See?

01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:08.760
If all of the new people you know who are the new Sahaja Yogis, new people. Just have a look.

01:43:09.610 --> 01:43:16.519
Left Vishuddhi, don't feel guilty. If you start feeling guilty, vibrations will disappear, not to feel guilty at all.

01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:21.840
So, Raji, are you feeling guilty?

01:43:28.430 --> 01:43:34.430
While people are working on you, please just try not to think. You will know whatever you have to know and everything you are going to know.

01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:42.520
But just don't think now. It has to happen. We know it is real. It is real. Whether you doubt it or not does not change to the fact that it is true.

01:43:42.890 --> 01:43:49.890
But just now you have to get it. So please try not to think just now. It won't help. Just a noise, that's all.

01:43:54.090 --> 01:43:59.090
Anybody, you just go and see all, check all the new people, you know who are the new.

01:44:01.290 --> 01:44:05.290
Come forward also, here some are sitting, new people are sitting here. Just see.

01:44:10.170 --> 01:44:25.170
What do you say? Left Vishuddhi, tell him not to feel guilty. Just terrible left Vishuddhi.

01:44:28.220 --> 01:44:35.283
Just see this, madam here, lady. Are they all, realize souls here?

01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:46.371
Tell him to say not, I am not guilty, tell him to say. Keep your eyes open.

01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:08.665
Jameel, you have made copies of that? Got it?

01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:09.680
Warren has.

01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:21.220
No, only one. This one I sent also with somebody for Warren.

01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:35.640
And now.

01:46:48.900 --> 01:46:55.665
Look at this lady, what are you doing? The Sahaja Yogis are sitting there, why don't you see them?

01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:18.045
This is what the Christ Disciple did when they got their realization.

01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:22.955
They said that they were moving their hands in such a way that people thought they were mad.

01:47:23.050 --> 01:47:30.050
Of course all mad people think all the sane people are mad, what to do?

01:47:35.450 --> 01:47:37.450
All right?

01:47:45.852 --> 01:47:50.592
All the new people who have not really felt the cool breeze, please raise your hands.

01:47:50.660 --> 01:48:01.660
Everybody must be attended to. Just see there, are you attending? Who is there? Caleb? Is it all right?

01:48:03.230 --> 01:48:05.230
He is raising the hand there.

01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:17.360
Vishuddhi, put your hand on the Vishuddhi.

01:48:24.130 --> 01:48:26.130
Terrible Vishuddhi.

01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:52.260
This is the Sahaja Yogis from Nasik have sent a tape for you all. We are telescopically working one program into another.

01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:54.310
It will work out.
