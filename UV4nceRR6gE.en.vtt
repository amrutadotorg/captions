00:03.360 --> 00:09.055
Rahuri is a place where a rakshasa called,

00:09.256 --> 00:12.806
demon called Rahu was killed by Goddess.

00:13.022 --> 00:18.536
And this is the place where my forefathers

00:19.538 --> 00:25.845
reigned as kings, and they had a dynasty
also.

00:28.354 --> 00:31.238
Now, the other place we went to, Musalwadi,
is the place where

00:31.438 --> 00:38.216
the Goddess first of all hit him with
a beam,

00:38.417 --> 00:44.203
so it is called as Musalwadi. It means
a beam, ‘musal’ means a ‘beam’.

00:44.404 --> 00:48.100
So this is a place where [the] Goddess has
done a lot of work.

00:48.301 --> 00:53.398
here is another place called Aradgaon where
he was running and he was screaming,

00:53.599 --> 00:57.895
so it’s called as arad. ‘Arad’ means
‘screaming’ (‘gaon’ means village).

00:58.096 --> 01:00.851
So the whole place is already very much
vibrated

01:01.052 --> 01:06.966
because also the Nathas, the nine Nathas —
we saw one Kanifnath there —

01:07.167 --> 01:10.268
but all of them lived in this area and
worked very hard.

01:10.476 --> 01:15.098
The last of all, Sainath, was very near
here, as you know, in Shirdi.

01:15.307 --> 01:18.637
So this is a very, very holy place

01:18.838 --> 01:23.806
and a place of great worship

01:24.007 --> 01:26.796
where many a times the Goddess was
worshipped.

01:27.003 --> 01:29.073
Rahuri itself, if you go round,

01:29.274 --> 01:32.496
you’ll find there are nine deities sitting
there.

01:32.697 --> 01:37.272
These are also created by Mother Earth.
They are beautiful things.

01:37.472 --> 01:39.424
No one knows about them. You can go and
have a look.

01:39.625 --> 01:47.242
There are nine of them and these represent
the nine incarnations of the Goddess,

01:48.806 --> 01:52.920
or nine styles of the Goddess.

01:53.976 --> 01:59.211
Now, in this beautiful place we are here,

01:59.412 --> 02:03.976
though it is spoiled by many things, but,
as you can see,

02:04.177 --> 02:08.994
it’s very comfortable for our Spirit to be
here.

02:09.195 --> 02:16.843
At this place I have seen a negativity,
kind of a thing, was working out

02:17.044 --> 02:19.873
about [which] I want to tell you today
again.

02:20.074 --> 02:25.095
That works out everywhere wherever there is
a leadership of a person.

02:25.296 --> 02:29.058
Here Mr. Dhumal came and he got his
Realisation,

02:29.259 --> 02:35.728
in Bombay, at my residence. And he came
back [and] he started working it out here.

02:35.929 --> 02:40.002
His brother brought him, but his brother
became quite negative to begin with,

02:40.211 --> 02:42.140
and then the negativity started working out

02:42.340 --> 02:44.858
and people started opposing him and
troubling him

02:45.058 --> 02:49.003
and I had to go through a very difficult
period during that time.

02:49.204 --> 02:52.302
So now, as you are travelling, I want
to tell you:

02:52.502 --> 02:54.478
don’t challenge your leaders.

02:54.679 --> 02:58.838
Because not only that it disturbs the whole
organisation,

02:59.039 --> 03:04.169
but it gives me a physical manifestation;
I suffer physically.

03:04.370 --> 03:07.226
Specially if you come and say things
against the leader

03:07.427 --> 03:10.530
in my presence I feel even worse.

03:10.731 --> 03:14.187
And once it happened that somebody was
talking about a leader

03:14.388 --> 03:16.924
and the whole of my back became so red

03:17.125 --> 03:24.396
that lots of blisters came out, I suffered
a lot.

03:24.614 --> 03:27.993
So I beg of you not to decide about
the leaders

03:28.194 --> 03:33.159
and don’t try to criticise them and take up
the ego position

03:33.360 --> 03:37.439
and try to see that, “He’s like this, he’s
hot tempered” or “He is this, that.”

03:37.640 --> 03:40.359
They have to be hot tempered! Because
I’m not.

03:40.560 --> 03:44.150
Because I cannot be very angry, they have
to protect me.

03:44.351 --> 03:47.939
As my protection, they have to be
hot-tempered and they have to tell you off.

03:48.140 --> 03:49.985
And if they tell off, then you should not
feel

03:50.185 --> 03:53.641
that they are bossy or they are doing these
things and all that.

03:53.842 --> 03:56.178
Actually those people who are bossy only
feel it,

03:56.379 --> 03:59.061
because they can’t bear that others can
tell them anything.

03:59.262 --> 04:03.814
So they think that others are bossy and
they are fine: that’s not so.

04:04.015 --> 04:06.357
So the trouble is that one should
understand

04:06.558 --> 04:10.455
that one has to work in this fashion.
I know what the leaders are.

04:10.656 --> 04:14.302
When I find the leaders are going wrong,
immediately I try to correct them.

04:14.503 --> 04:16.568
But you should not try to challenge
the leaders.

04:16.768 --> 04:22.248
But this is the greatest problem I had
in the West

04:22.449 --> 04:26.371
and later on I found here also, in India,
it used to brew up.

04:26.572 --> 04:29.995
Whenever I went away, then it started off:
the leader was challenged.

04:30.196 --> 04:34.277
As if I don’t know about the leaders, as if
I don’t know anything about them,

04:34.478 --> 04:39.396
as if I am to be told, as if I am
absolutely ignorant.

04:39.597 --> 04:42.239
So you don’t have to worry. You shouldn’t
worry about it.

04:42.439 --> 04:45.694
I will tell you who is the leader and how
to work it out.

04:45.957 --> 04:48.550
It sometimes, of course, happens that
the leaders go off.

04:48.751 --> 04:52.267
I know that they go off. It happens that
they fall a trap

04:52.468 --> 04:54.698
to a wrong person. It’s quite possible;

04:54.899 --> 04:57.730
after all they have become leaders just
like you,

04:57.931 --> 04:59.664
with my special permission.

04:59.865 --> 05:02.123
But could be such a situation can come up

05:02.324 --> 05:04.645
and I want to then correct them and I
always tell them that,

05:04.845 --> 05:07.567
“This is a wrong thing you have done.
This is to be corrected.”

05:07.768 --> 05:11.166
But otherwise the whole administration
of Sahaja Yoga is impossible.

05:11.397 --> 05:13.360
It has to work through the leaders.

05:13.561 --> 05:16.578
You shouldn’t see how they talk, what they
say to you,

05:16.779 --> 05:18.871
what they work out, but do what they tell
you.

05:19.072 --> 05:21.282
There is no freedom lost in that.

05:21.482 --> 05:23.737
You will see that your freedom will be
maintained,

05:23.937 --> 05:26.036
respected and will be done.

05:26.237 --> 05:32.370
On the contrary, I will say, when there is
a sloppy and a mild leadership

05:32.579 --> 05:35.590
it’s just impossible. Everybody else
becomes the leader.

05:35.790 --> 05:39.076
Like England, we can say, that Gavin was
very, very mild

05:39.277 --> 05:41.278
and now there are so many leaders who
come up,

05:41.479 --> 05:43.280
talk big, “Do this! Do that!”

05:43.481 --> 05:48.070
I’m having a big problem in England of so
many mushroom-like egos coming up.

05:48.271 --> 05:52.358
And they become so flippant and
nonsensical, and they talk all nonsense,

05:52.567 --> 05:53.913
they start giving lectures, this, that.

05:54.113 --> 05:56.533
It’s impossible then to control.

05:56.740 --> 05:59.138
If Gavin was a strong fellow he would have
put them right.

05:59.339 --> 06:01.856
But he’s too good and too much of
a gentleman, I think.

06:02.057 --> 06:05.067
That much of gentlemanliness is of no use
in Sahaja Yoga.

06:05.267 --> 06:08.592
So if he had handled the whole situation,

06:08.793 --> 06:11.655
with that thing is all right, and would
have worked out very well.

06:11.856 --> 06:16.346
But sometimes also the leader is told
to shut up, “You shut up!”

06:16.547 --> 06:17.930
And like that he goes on shutting up.

06:18.130 --> 06:21.059
Everybody joins hands and shuts up
the leader

06:21.260 --> 06:25.829
and the leader becomes absolutely
a cabbage — he doesn’t say anything.

06:26.030 --> 06:29.037
So this is also a very bad habit is to say,
“Shut up! Don’t say anything!”

06:29.238 --> 06:31.456
I don’t like it. If somebody is talking
to me,

06:31.657 --> 06:35.704
you shouldn’t just in front of me say,
“Shut up!” to that person

06:35.913 --> 06:38.227
or pull his hand, or just punch him;

06:38.427 --> 06:40.623
I don’t like all that, at all. That hurts
me.

06:40.831 --> 06:42.644
You should never do like that. I have seen
people

06:42.845 --> 06:45.447
have a this very bad habit, “Don’t say!”
“Don’t talk!”

06:45.648 --> 06:49.418
As if they are the greatest, wisest people
ever born to say such a thing:

06:49.619 --> 06:52.208
is a very wrong idea and this should not
be done.

06:52.416 --> 06:54.696
This should never be done in my presence,
I don’t like it,

06:54.896 --> 06:59.382
it hurts me, and physically it manifests.

06:59.583 --> 07:02.771
So don’t do like this, don’t say anything,
don’t do it! I know how to handle it.

07:02.972 --> 07:06.238
If somebody is very funny I can tell that
person, “Now stop it!”

07:06.439 --> 07:11.181
I can do it. But you just don’t try to take
over things like that.

07:11.382 --> 07:13.923
Of course the leaders can do it,

07:14.124 --> 07:17.094
leaders, the ones who are grown up,
matured people,

07:17.294 --> 07:19.328
can just tell them to keep quiet.

07:19.529 --> 07:22.616
But all the time some people have the habit
of saying, “No!” and “No!”

07:22.817 --> 07:25.340
It’s bhootish, I would say. It’s really
bhootish.

07:25.541 --> 07:28.353
Because they never allow me to see
the reality.

07:28.554 --> 07:32.368
We must know what’s happening, what people
have to say. I should know about it.

07:32.569 --> 07:36.659
There’s nothing wrong in it. But on
the contrary, they come and tell me,

07:36.860 --> 07:39.481
“Our leader is like that, our leader is
like that.”

07:39.682 --> 07:43.799
That you don’t worry because my attention
is most on your leaders.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.562
I do change leaders and I will change
leaders in case they are wrong.

07:47.763 --> 07:51.639
But let me decide. That decision you leave
it to me.

07:51.840 --> 07:53.858
So this is another point I wanted to say
about Rahuri,

07:54.059 --> 07:57.610
which I learnt a lesson here. Then another
thing I found out:

07:57.811 --> 08:02.386
The villagers here are much more easily
convinced,

08:02.587 --> 08:04.852
they take to Sahaja Yoga very well.

08:05.053 --> 08:08.353
And while the educated take time to take
to Sahaja Yoga;

08:08.554 --> 08:11.288
naturally because they think they are very
well educated!

08:11.489 --> 08:13.910
And they find it difficult to forget their
education

08:14.111 --> 08:17.876
and become simpler people. So in the same
way, you will find the simple people

08:18.077 --> 08:21.725
will take to Sahaja Yoga much faster than
the people who are educated;

08:21.926 --> 08:26.388
because their mind works too fast, they
cannot catch the vibrations.

08:26.589 --> 08:29.067
The mind is running fast, the vibrations
are running after them

08:29.267 --> 08:33.822
and it’s a big game of hide and seek going
on! But doesn’t matter.

08:34.023 --> 08:39.054
Still, once that intelligent get to Sahaja
Yoga, then it works even wonders.

08:39.255 --> 08:42.267
Once they get to it, they take time, no
doubt. They take time,

08:42.468 --> 08:45.687
but once they take, get to it then it works
wonders.

08:45.896 --> 08:50.796
So some people take [to] it easily, but
they don’t work out that well;

08:50.996 --> 08:54.580
those who take with difficulty, work out
better;

08:54.780 --> 08:58.323
in the sense that they can intelligently
manifest it

08:58.523 --> 09:01.954
and talk to people and tell them about it.

09:02.155 --> 09:04.294
So this is another thing one has to
remember that:

09:04.495 --> 09:08.426
try to understand that through your
education you have not known anything.

09:08.626 --> 09:11.262
Because you never felt vibrations, you did
not even know

09:11.463 --> 09:13.582
that there was something like that
existing!

09:13.790 --> 09:15.940
This is a new knowledge, absolutely
a new thing.

09:16.141 --> 09:18.287
Absolutely it has nothing to do with your
degrees,

09:18.487 --> 09:21.276
M.A.D. and Ph.D.s and all those things.

09:21.476 --> 09:25.012
It is something else that is existing,
which you have to feel.

09:25.213 --> 09:30.233
So if you take that simple attitude it
would be a better idea.

09:30.434 --> 09:39.790
Now the fourth thing which upsets me is
grouping, to form a group.

09:39.991 --> 09:42.848
That’s another very upsetting thing is
to form a group.

09:43.049 --> 09:47.735
This is one group of this place or group
of that place: who belongs to this place.

09:47.936 --> 09:52.503
And this grouping, once it takes place
there is a gap in the collective.

09:52.704 --> 09:57.071
When there’s a grouping, say, a nose and
eyes they become one group;

09:57.272 --> 09:59.512
then there’s a gap between them and
the hands.

09:59.712 --> 10:03.688
So if there’s a problem in the nose,
the hands will not act.

10:03.889 --> 10:08.275
So the whole activity becomes
a disintegrated activity.

10:08.476 --> 10:10.038
So one should never form a group.

10:10.239 --> 10:14.517
Those who have a habit of forming a group
must be completely discouraged.

10:14.718 --> 10:18.986
They start saying against somebody, then
against that one, then this that,

10:19.187 --> 10:21.767
then they form a group, the one group goes
there, one group.

10:21.967 --> 10:25.221
So grouping is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga,
it is malignancy.

10:25.444 --> 10:29.280
It is malignancy. If it starts working out,
you become malignant.

10:29.481 --> 10:33.241
The whole group becomes malignant and
it’s a very difficult problem then

10:33.442 --> 10:36.365
to put them right.

10:36.566 --> 10:43.404
And one should not accept any sort of
a sloppy or a very mild leadership also.

10:43.605 --> 10:46.380
One should accept a strong,

10:46.580 --> 10:49.888
fierce, I would say, to some extent,
leadership. That will help.

10:50.089 --> 10:54.172
Because our ideas are very different from
what you have had so far,

10:54.373 --> 10:58.149
“The leader should be pleasing to us. He
should have a personality

10:58.350 --> 11:01.719
that will be extremely lovey-dovey type.”
That’s not so.

11:01.920 --> 11:05.240
The leader has to be a strong, fierce
personality

11:05.441 --> 11:08.901
that should make people respect him and
have awe for him.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.650
But because we are so free we can pass
remarks

11:11.851 --> 11:14.965
about the leader and say, “This leader
is bad, that leader is bad.”

11:15.165 --> 11:17.957
But it’s not a good thing! It doesn’t help.
It doesn’t help.

11:18.158 --> 11:22.090
On the contrary, as I told you, the sloppy
people create horrible problems!

11:22.291 --> 11:26.398
And then you get so many egoistical people
who come up.

11:26.598 --> 11:29.247
I mean a sloppy person, if there’s one
sloppy person,

11:29.448 --> 11:34.006
or who has accepted such a domination,
if he is there as a leader,

11:34.207 --> 11:37.393
all the rest of the people, those who come
in contact

11:37.593 --> 11:39.990
with that person, also become ego-oriented.

11:40.191 --> 11:43.077
They also start behaving in such a manner
that you can’t imagine.

11:43.277 --> 11:47.113
Like Gavin’s is a very good example:

11:47.313 --> 11:50.729
in his office he had arranged work for
some people.

11:50.930 --> 11:54.285
Everyone who worked in his office got
into this trouble,

11:54.486 --> 11:57.745
because he was so good that they picked up
their ego, you see,

11:57.946 --> 12:01.643
because the superego was there,

12:01.844 --> 12:05.370
so they thought better to use your ego and
that’s how the whole thing worked out.

12:05.570 --> 12:09.475
Poor fellow had to ask all of them to get
out of the office.

12:09.676 --> 12:12.962
So this is an example for us and there’s
nothing to feel

12:13.162 --> 12:17.251
that it is any criticism of anything.

12:17.452 --> 12:20.017
But it doesn’t work out, this system
doesn’t work out.

12:20.218 --> 12:29.304
So you should not try to make an effort
that you criticise them.

12:29.505 --> 12:31.833
Now, another thing about leadership I have
to tell you

12:32.033 --> 12:34.888
[is] that supposing I have appointed
Christine as a leader.

12:35.089 --> 12:37.840
She is the leader of North America:

12:38.041 --> 12:41.315
then she has to take the decisions for
North America.

12:41.515 --> 12:44.509
But nobody else, not even her husband
should take any decisions.

12:44.709 --> 12:48.011
He should not. He should have nothing
to do. He should be in the background.

12:48.212 --> 12:51.834
Whosoever is the leader should deal with
the problem.

12:52.035 --> 12:55.537
This is the trouble is, if the wife is
there, then the husband takes over,

12:55.737 --> 12:58.429
husband gets, then the wife. Like I should
say Poona,

12:58.630 --> 13:01.337
Poona, I appointed somebody there, he was
shut down

13:01.538 --> 13:03.736
and his wife took over; and the wife is
a horrid stuff.

13:03.936 --> 13:06.261
I mean, I don’t know what to do with
such things.

13:06.462 --> 13:09.495
It is very difficult that, if it’s
a husband, it’s a husband,

13:09.695 --> 13:12.700
it’s a wife, it’s a wife. Then the wife
becomes little dominating,

13:12.901 --> 13:16.004
the husband comes back and then the husband
starts ruling.

13:16.205 --> 13:19.216
Then my attention is on the wife, here
the husband becomes…

13:19.416 --> 13:22.259
In leadership there is nothing like husband
and wife. They have nothing to do.

13:22.460 --> 13:25.169
Whosoever is the leader is to be accepted
as the leader,

13:25.369 --> 13:27.521
whether he is the husband or the wife.
This is one thing:

13:27.721 --> 13:31.276
in Sahaja Yoga there is no discrimination
between women and men.

13:31.477 --> 13:34.123
Not that the men should always rule nor
the women should rule.

13:34.324 --> 13:37.394
It is whosoever is appointed as the leader
is the leader.

13:37.595 --> 13:40.424
I must tell you these things because these
little, little things

13:40.624 --> 13:43.384
make such a difference to the whole
organisation

13:43.585 --> 13:46.905
that I don’t know how to tell. Because
husband has no right as a leader.

13:47.106 --> 13:51.205
He’s not appointed as a leader, so he has
no right as a leader.

13:51.406 --> 13:55.489
If you all understand this point that
leadership is very important part.

13:55.690 --> 13:59.446
It’s like the main organ of the body.

13:59.748 --> 14:03.358
And that leadership should not be
challenged at any cost, any time.

14:03.559 --> 14:06.477
Like Dr. Sanghvi is the leader of Nasik.

14:06.677 --> 14:08.980
So he is the leader. He has to do it.

14:09.181 --> 14:14.301
It is he who decides, it is he who says.
Nobody should challenge it [him].

14:14.502 --> 14:17.979
So we have got leaders of different places,
if you have any problems

14:18.179 --> 14:20.900
about deciding who is the leader, you come
and ask me.

14:21.101 --> 14:25.057
I always appoint one person. In Italy,
Gregoire, I don’t know why,

14:25.257 --> 14:27.915
he said there should be two persons.
I don’t know why he said two.

14:28.116 --> 14:29.856
But I told him, “Gregoire, it’s not a wrong
thing,”

14:30.056 --> 14:31.728
but he just said, “No. You must have.”

14:31.929 --> 14:36.122
And the second one was dropped out so
badly, I mean he really harmed us.

14:36.323 --> 14:38.650
So just listen to me! I know, I understand.

14:38.851 --> 14:41.582
Guido can say that, what has happened
in Italy,

14:41.783 --> 14:43.480
is because they didn’t listen to me.

14:43.681 --> 14:45.929
Here we are not to please everyone.

14:46.129 --> 14:49.486
No, we are not here to take any voting
or anything.

14:49.687 --> 14:51.984
We are here to do the job, and for doing
the job

14:52.184 --> 14:54.788
we must take the right course, right
methods.

14:54.988 --> 14:57.358
So those who think, “Oh, have three
of them then!”

14:57.559 --> 14:59.592
Then, “Have five of them!” This is
nonsense!

14:59.793 --> 15:03.355
For what? Just to pamper ego?

15:03.556 --> 15:05.847
Any leader is as good as you people are,

15:06.047 --> 15:08.661
[the] only difference is my attention is
on that leader.

15:08.862 --> 15:10.631
That’s why it works out better.

15:10.831 --> 15:12.591
Don’t allow your ego to dominate you.

15:12.791 --> 15:15.260
There’s nothing… What does he do? Poor
man, the leader now?

15:15.461 --> 15:19.827
For example, I would say, Warren: he worked
so hard, he really laboured through.

15:20.028 --> 15:22.517
And he worked so hard he got so sick.
I was wondering.

15:22.718 --> 15:26.893
It’s all right for me. I am after all
a Adi Shakti,

15:27.093 --> 15:31.407
so it doesn’t matter I can be, I can be
a marathon.

15:31.608 --> 15:35.358
But this fellow was working with me. I knew
he’ll have to give way at a point.

15:35.559 --> 15:40.335
It’s too much. And then people start
criticising Warren, I can’t understand.

15:40.536 --> 15:44.244
I mean, he is working day in and day out.
Can’t they see this?

15:44.445 --> 15:48.247
Without him what would have happened
to us?

15:48.474 --> 15:51.360
I mean, those who are leaders work so hard,
they do so much

15:51.560 --> 15:53.854
and then you start criticising. That’s not
proper.

15:54.055 --> 15:57.406
That’s being a bit ingratitude towards
them and towards me.

15:57.606 --> 16:01.823
On the contrary, I feel so much obliged
to them. After all this is my job.

16:02.023 --> 16:05.260
This is I am paid for it, I can say.

16:05.461 --> 16:08.726
So I am doing this job, all right. But what
about them?

16:08.927 --> 16:12.513
They are human beings, they have got their
other things.

16:12.714 --> 16:15.576
I don’t have to earn money, I don’t have
any problems.

16:15.791 --> 16:17.507
So why? Why bother them?

16:17.708 --> 16:20.937
They are the ones who have dedicated
their lives doing so much,

16:21.138 --> 16:23.576
and then you start criticising them.
It is impossible.

16:23.777 --> 16:27.127
But if he says anything to you, “Don’t do
this, and don’t do that!”

16:27.328 --> 16:30.463
And sometimes it is with my consultation
he does it.

16:30.664 --> 16:34.307
Which things I cannot say directly, he
might say indirectly to you.

16:34.508 --> 16:36.240
So you shouldn’t challenge such things.

16:36.441 --> 16:39.275
This is one of the things today I wanted
to talk, about leadership,

16:39.475 --> 16:44.858
because this is a place where I have faced
some problems of leadership.

16:45.781 --> 16:51.255
And one should understand that this is the
only way Sahaja Yoga is going to work out.

16:51.456 --> 16:55.725
In the body also, as you know, it is not
that the heart,

16:55.926 --> 16:59.367
which is the heart, is the complete pumping
source.

16:59.568 --> 17:01.759
Now the heart’s work is to be accepted:

17:01.959 --> 17:05.219
that it is this pumping source, and it
gives to all the other organs.

17:05.420 --> 17:07.749
So liver is liver, brain is brain.

17:07.950 --> 17:09.276
Brain doesn’t want to become the heart,

17:09.476 --> 17:10.983
heart doesn’t want to become the liver.

17:11.184 --> 17:16.404
Now the liver cells, if they say that, “Now
we will work for the heart!”

17:16.605 --> 17:20.883
or “We’ll form a group!” then how can you
do it?

17:21.702 --> 17:24.206
So as we have got very important organs,

17:24.406 --> 17:27.705
we have got very important leaders. And
I know what they are up to,

17:27.906 --> 17:31.228
I know what’s wrong with them, so you leave
it to me to correct them.

17:31.432 --> 17:33.515
All right, this is for the foreigners
today.

17:33.715 --> 17:36.580
Because now we’ll be moving further and
further

17:36.781 --> 17:39.542
into more difficult time, I think, because
there may be

17:39.743 --> 17:43.041
little spartan living for you because you
asked for it!

17:43.242 --> 17:47.139
You wanted to have a camping ground, so I
have arranged a camping ground for you.

17:47.340 --> 17:49.549
So then you should not say [about]
the leader,

17:49.749 --> 17:52.670
“Where is he? Now call him! What have
you done?”

17:52.870 --> 17:57.219
It’s all arranged by me, so don’t blame
him. And enjoy yourself.

17:57.420 --> 18:00.473
And don’t try to say that it’s he who
should have looked after:

18:00.674 --> 18:03.183
he’s not paid for it. He’s not paid for it.

18:03.384 --> 18:05.453
I am paid for it. They are not.

18:05.654 --> 18:09.799
In the sense [that] I am paid because I am
made for that.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.803
It’s my job. I am doing it because I have
to do it.

18:13.004 --> 18:17.302
I cannot do anything else but to do this
job, otherwise I won’t exist, you see.

18:17.502 --> 18:20.535
So mine is a different point. But if he’s
doing it,

18:20.736 --> 18:23.412
then it is an obligation on me. And in
a way I feel,

18:23.613 --> 18:25.795
and you all should feel, also, obliged.

18:25.996 --> 18:28.798
May God bless you all.

18:29.335 --> 18:34.250
[Marathi Talk for 10 minutes, the
Shri Mataji talks again in English]

28:22.399 --> 28:25.888
A saint will never criticize another saint.
Is never done.

28:26.088 --> 28:28.513
Saint will always appreciate another saint.

28:28.714 --> 28:31.312
And also a devil will, no doubt.

28:31.513 --> 28:37.663
But if you are neither a devil nor a saint,
then you start criticizing each other.

28:38.163 --> 28:39.903
So don’t criticize each other.

28:40.103 --> 28:44.394
You are all saints of a very high quality,
don’t criticize each other.

28:44.595 --> 28:46.535
See for yourself what’s wrong with you,

28:46.735 --> 28:49.402
why are you seeing all the bad points
of another person?

28:49.603 --> 28:55.011
Why don’t you see your bad points? It’s
an obtuse angles.

28:55.212 --> 28:58.093
You see, with an obtuse angle if you are
looking at people, you see,

28:58.294 --> 29:02.415
then you see things which do not exist,
which are not good for you.

29:02.616 --> 29:04.546
So develop a kind of a sensitivity

29:04.747 --> 29:07.491
by which you see your own problems and
not others’.

29:07.692 --> 29:10.809
If you start finding faults with others,
immediately put back to yourself:

29:11.010 --> 29:14.376
“Why? What’s wrong with me?”.

29:14.577 --> 29:17.414
If somebody you call your leader, or
anybody a bossy person,

29:17.623 --> 29:22.253
see: are you a bossy person yourself?
You must be.

29:23.675 --> 29:27.499
Then it will be all right. Because it is in
Sahaja Yoga there is nothing hidden,

29:27.699 --> 29:31.141
nothing kept secret, everybody knows
about everyone.

29:31.342 --> 29:34.036
Because whatever I may say today, tomorrow
you’ll be so changed

29:34.236 --> 29:39.911
I will not even be able to recognize you.
It is going to be so much difficult

29:40.112 --> 29:42.714
to recognize you, because you are growing
so fast.

29:42.915 --> 29:46.806
So keep to the growth, keep to the growth.

29:47.707 --> 29:51.309
Thank you very much. It is so that today
the puja had to start late,

29:51.509 --> 29:54.632
because you know, there are certain things…

29:54.833 --> 29:57.164
I just blame other things which nothing
is there,

29:57.365 --> 30:01.390
you cannot blame anyone, that has to be,
that has to be.

30:01.615 --> 30:03.188
I was born at 12 o’clock, you see,

30:03.388 --> 30:07.961
so to start puja before that is something
out of place.

30:08.162 --> 30:10.395
And I have to wait till twelve to pass out
nicely,

30:10.595 --> 30:15.647
so that I should try and awake myself

30:16.078 --> 30:20.326
to my responsibility and all the deities
must be awakened.

30:20.527 --> 30:22.890
You see, they have their own style and
their own timings

30:23.091 --> 30:26.716
and I cannot force them to do what I want
to do or [what] you want to do.

30:26.917 --> 30:33.304
It’s another style. They are so bound, that
I cannot force them anything.

30:33.505 --> 30:36.726
You also should know my helplessness
about it.

30:36.927 --> 30:39.962
Thank you very much.

31:35.587 --> 31:37.663
After the puja you must mix up with these
people,

31:37.863 --> 31:40.520
ask their names, talk to them, who they
are –

31:40.721 --> 31:45.201
you must meet your brothers and sisters
from Rahuri.

40:38.182 --> 40:41.793
Shri Mataji: Vibrations…

42:17.084 --> 42:18.938
Shri Mataji: Take a bandhan. It’s a good
idea.

42:19.145 --> 42:21.955
See, we have to be serious about it. We
must understand.

42:22.156 --> 42:25.578
We are saints, and we should take it up
everything seriously.

42:25.778 --> 42:28.960
It’s a tremendous task.
