02:18.644 --> 02:20.175
Interviewer: Is this your first visit here?

02:20.175 --> 02:21.525
Shri Mataji: Oh no.

02:21.525 --> 02:22.525
Interviewer: No?

02:22.525 --> 02:24.114
How many times have you been here before?

02:24.114 --> 02:25.114
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

02:25.114 --> 02:26.945
Interviewer: How many times have you been
here?

02:26.945 --> 02:30.415
Shri Mataji: I haven’t counted.

02:30.415 --> 02:33.515
Must be how many times?

02:33.515 --> 02:35.495
From 1974.

02:35.495 --> 02:37.485
Interviewer: Right.

02:37.485 --> 02:42.454
Shri Mataji: Practically every year.

02:42.454 --> 02:46.675
Sometimes I missed one or twice.

02:46.675 --> 02:57.155
Interviewer: And what is the main emphasis
in your teaching?

02:57.155 --> 03:17.445
Shri Mataji: To convey that within us lies
a power which we call as Kundalini in the

03:17.445 --> 03:29.844
triangular bone and when awakened, it passes
through six subtle centres through our spinal

03:29.844 --> 03:40.325
chord, our brain, ultimately into limbic area
and pierces through the fontanel bone area

03:40.325 --> 03:43.575
which was the soft bone in our childhood.

03:43.575 --> 03:52.204
This is the actualization of baptism, actualization.

03:52.204 --> 04:01.674
And this power within us is the reflection
of the Holy Ghost.

04:01.674 --> 04:06.395
Thus you get your second birth, that’s how
you are twice born.

04:06.395 --> 04:08.204
Interviewer: Oh I see.

04:08.204 --> 04:10.465
Shri Mataji: Yes, born again.

04:10.465 --> 04:11.914
Interviewer: And everyone has this?

04:11.914 --> 04:12.914
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

04:12.914 --> 04:13.914
Interviewer: Everyone has this?

04:13.914 --> 04:14.914
Shri Mataji: Everyone everyone has.

04:14.914 --> 04:16.555
Interviewer: And how do people find it?

04:16.555 --> 04:19.825
Shri Mataji: I knew about it since my birth
I think.

04:19.825 --> 04:22.084
Interviewer: And what about the people you
teach?

04:22.084 --> 04:23.084
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

04:23.084 --> 04:26.545
Interviewer: The people you teach, how can
they find this power?

04:26.545 --> 04:36.575
Shri Mataji: (Unclear) They feel themselves,
the cool breeze on top of their heads.

04:36.575 --> 04:42.145
And they feel they are connected with this
power because they can feel it on their fingertips,

04:42.145 --> 04:48.685
also this power.

04:48.685 --> 04:59.985
Interviewer: And the groups you speak to,
what sort of people are they?

04:59.985 --> 05:04.865
Shri Mataji: (Unclear) Are conditioned people.

05:04.865 --> 05:12.065
Or sometimes ego is there also, lot of ego.

05:12.065 --> 05:23.945
They are not open-minded like scientists are.

05:23.945 --> 05:34.745
And they are conditioned by different faiths
and blind faiths.

05:34.745 --> 05:45.405
Interviewer: I have some information here
which says you have an emphasis on the spiritual

05:45.405 --> 05:49.025
importance of women and their role.

05:49.025 --> 05:53.265
In what way, you know how are women important
in this way?

05:53.265 --> 05:55.975
In establishing the balance of society.

05:55.975 --> 05:59.355
Shri Mataji: Because women are the potential.

05:59.355 --> 06:12.925
Men are the kinetic energy and women don’t
know how powerful they are within themselves

06:12.925 --> 06:17.085
and they try to compete with men and get frustrated.

06:17.085 --> 06:22.475
Interviewer: And how are they powerful in
this way, different from men?

06:22.475 --> 06:29.955
Shri Mataji: Because they have forbearance,
they have lot of forbearance, they are the

06:29.955 --> 06:40.585
preservers of society, they are the preservers
of family life and they create beautiful children.

06:40.585 --> 06:52.735
Motherhood is a sure thing, fatherhood is
uncertain isn’t it?

06:52.735 --> 07:06.345
Interviewer: And so you’ve travelled the
world have you, speaking to people?

07:06.345 --> 07:11.135
Shri Mataji: Yes, I don’t know how many
countries, I travel.

07:11.135 --> 07:18.635
I’ve been to Russia, to all the Eastern
block people.

07:18.635 --> 07:29.795
They seem to be very much clean about it because
they are not so conditioned and in our freedom

07:29.795 --> 07:34.075
we have lost many things which were important
to us.

07:34.075 --> 07:36.615
Interviewer: Such as?

07:36.615 --> 07:48.775
Shri Mataji: Such as chastity, innocence,
simplicity, respect.

07:48.775 --> 07:52.845
Interviewer: And how can people get these
virtues back then?

07:52.845 --> 08:02.655
Shri Mataji: Once these centres are awakened
and nourished you feel physically all right,

08:02.655 --> 08:16.595
mentally all right and your attention is filled
with the light of the Spirit and thus you’ll

08:16.595 --> 08:30.905
see what is spirituality is within yourself
and you understand your beauty.

08:30.905 --> 08:35.635
And then you enjoy your virtues, you become
religious, it’s not a question of saying

08:35.635 --> 08:40.725
I’m this religion, that religion, you just
become religious, you become.

08:40.725 --> 08:47.865
Like one may follow any religion but can do
any sins, they are equally the same, there’s

08:47.865 --> 08:52.665
no difference, it’s just a brand.

08:52.665 --> 09:03.555
Interviewer: The recent Gulf War what sort
of effect has that had on people as a whole?

09:03.555 --> 09:17.975
Shri Mataji: At least one thing is that fundamentalism
is a very dangerous thing.

09:17.975 --> 09:21.865
Any religion that gets exclusive can be very
dangerous.

09:21.865 --> 09:37.275
In Sahaja Yoga you realise that all these
prophets, incarnations, saints were born on

09:37.275 --> 09:48.815
the same tree of life or of spirituality and
we have plucked them, saying this is mine,

09:48.815 --> 09:58.085
this is mine and we are fighting with those
dead flowers.

09:58.085 --> 10:05.425
Interviewer: So how can people be helped through
your type of teaching?

10:05.425 --> 10:24.964
Shri Mataji: Because of this happening you
get completely integrated within yourself.

10:24.964 --> 10:38.404
Also all these centres which are within us
were created by these great incarnations in

10:38.404 --> 10:51.285
the evolutionary process and they are all
lined up together.

10:51.285 --> 11:03.935
Thus we realise that if this Kundalini has
to pass through we have to put them into the

11:03.935 --> 11:07.044
same garland.

11:07.044 --> 11:15.245
It’s a happening.

11:15.245 --> 11:21.055
Interviewer: And how long have you been teaching
this?

11:21.055 --> 11:23.146
Shri Mataji: I started in 1970.

11:23.146 --> 11:30.625
Interviewer: And how long did it take you
to come to this.

11:30.625 --> 11:39.435
Shri Mataji: No I started working out with
one lady to begin with in India.

11:39.435 --> 11:49.185
Then as my husband got elected to a post,
as you must have heard about, he was the Secretary

11:49.185 --> 11:54.075
General of the International Maritime Organisation
U.N..

11:54.075 --> 12:00.865
I went to London and I started with seven
hippies.

12:00.865 --> 12:08.825
They were hippies but very well educated professors
and lawyers and things like that but had become

12:08.825 --> 12:15.595
hippies just for seeking the truth.

12:15.595 --> 12:31.935
I had to work very hard on them but they are
the foundation of Sahaja Yoga.

12:31.935 --> 12:42.965
And that’s how then one of them went abroad
to some other place, it started spreading.

12:42.965 --> 12:50.405
England is a, like a heart of the universe
because everyone comes there and they carry

12:50.405 --> 12:56.095
to their own country.

12:56.095 --> 13:03.315
Interviewer: And which countries have you
been to ..

13:03.315 --> 13:08.735
would there be so many that you ..

13:08.735 --> 13:14.495
Shri Mataji: Yes, I have been at least to
forty five countries.

13:14.495 --> 13:16.415
Interviewer: Really?

13:16.415 --> 13:19.295
Shri Mataji: Yes.

13:19.295 --> 13:25.595
Interviewer: When you were working with these
people how long did it take you to come to

13:25.595 --> 13:27.035
now, to what you understand?

13:27.035 --> 13:29.335
Shri Mataji: About what?

13:29.335 --> 13:30.815
Interviewer: Your teachings.

13:30.815 --> 13:32.675
How did it come together?

13:32.675 --> 13:43.005
Shri Mataji: I see a great future, a new race
is coming up.

13:43.005 --> 14:01.735
They are devoid of all addictions, devoid
of all diseases, devoid of unchaste things,

14:01.735 --> 14:09.495
devoid of things which are wrong like they
lead a very nice married life, have nice children,

14:09.495 --> 14:12.805
absolutely angelic I would say.

14:12.805 --> 14:27.414
I don’t have to tell them anything, they
are on their own because they have evolved.

14:27.414 --> 14:32.445
This is the last breakthrough of our evolution.

14:32.445 --> 14:40.985
They are beautiful people.

14:40.985 --> 14:54.905
We have seventy five to eighty marriages every
year, all international, and except for one

14:54.905 --> 15:05.925
percent, they are all very very successful.

15:05.925 --> 15:12.235
Interviewer: And do you intend on continuing
to travel, how long do you think you will

15:12.235 --> 15:13.235
be travelling for?

15:13.235 --> 15:15.935
Shri Mataji: I can’t say, already I am sixty
eight years of age.

15:15.935 --> 15:24.555
Can’t say, as long as possible I would like
to travel because somehow they like me very

15:24.555 --> 15:28.164
much everywhere I think.

15:28.164 --> 15:34.794
Interviewer: And you obviously enjoy travelling
and speaking to people about it.

15:34.794 --> 15:36.104
Shri Mataji: Yes.

15:36.104 --> 15:37.905
Interviewer: Why do you enjoy doing it?

15:37.905 --> 15:38.905
Shri Mataji: What?

15:38.905 --> 15:41.794
Interviewer: Why do you enjoy travelling and
telling people about this?

15:41.794 --> 15:56.775
Shri Mataji: It’s so nice to see so many
getting the meaning of their life, so many

15:56.775 --> 16:07.135
getting rid of their problems and man-made
nonsense that they have on their heads.

16:07.135 --> 16:13.305
Also they are capable of giving Realizations
to others.

16:13.305 --> 16:21.525
And also if you give vibrations to your agriculture
it improves, to animals if you give it improves.

16:21.525 --> 16:30.475
Also it solves ecological problems because
they become so wise.

16:30.475 --> 16:39.974
We have to worry about the emancipation of
human beings as a whole, as a whole because

16:39.974 --> 16:56.354
we are one world and they all feel they are
citizens of the universe.

16:56.354 --> 17:04.544
And the love they have, respect they have
for each other and the silence they enjoy

17:04.544 --> 17:12.284
shows that we’ll have no more wars, no more
problems and we’ll always abide in the beautiful

17:12.284 --> 17:17.405
realm of kingdom of God.

17:17.405 --> 17:22.724
It’s the greatest satisfaction anybody can.

17:22.724 --> 17:29.645
This cannot be given by money, power, anything.

17:29.645 --> 17:42.075
When I leave one country I feel very much
wrenched, as if my heart is being wrenched

17:42.075 --> 17:47.284
because I feel that I am leaving all of them
there, but when I reach another country I

17:47.284 --> 17:55.595
see again beautiful flower-like faces.

17:55.595 --> 17:58.745
This is what all the incarnations wanted.

17:58.745 --> 18:08.844
We have no organisation as such, I have no
secretary, nothing.

18:08.844 --> 18:13.325
It’s like a stateless state you can call
it.

18:13.325 --> 18:26.375
And we have no problems, we just enjoy that’s
all.

18:26.375 --> 18:30.475
Pure enjoyment.

18:30.475 --> 18:37.425
Interviewer: Thank you very much for your
time, it’s been very interesting, thank

18:37.425 --> 18:38.425
you.

18:38.425 --> 18:47.345
Shri Mataji: You are so intelligent I must
say, I thought you are a little girl, she’s

18:47.345 --> 18:48.755
very intelligent.

18:48.755 --> 18:53.755
Yesterday I was in New Zealand talking to
the interviewer, with the gentleman interviewing,

18:53.755 --> 19:00.034
he felt the cool breeze in his hands immediately
and he came to my program also.

19:00.034 --> 19:04.335
Interviewer: Thank you.

19:04.335 --> 19:14.375
Shri Mataji: Want to take a photograph?

19:14.375 --> 19:15.805
(Unclear).

19:15.805 --> 19:30.145
Sahaja Yogi: She’s got it Shri Mataji, she’s
got it.

19:30.145 --> 19:36.935
Shri Mataji: She’s got it.

19:36.935 --> 19:55.324
First time
I met (unclear) in Australia.

19:55.324 --> 19:59.465
They cannot see subtler things, that’s the
trouble is.

19:59.465 --> 20:03.615
And they also find it’s not so sensational.

20:03.615 --> 20:15.295
It’s the most sensational thing don’t
you think so?

20:15.295 --> 20:32.025
It’s for the betterment of the whole world,
the most sensational thing.

20:32.025 --> 20:40.735
It’s a silent revolution, peaceful revolution
that’s coming.

20:40.735 --> 20:46.175
Has to come after all.

20:46.175 --> 20:51.915
We are waiting for a shock all over.

20:51.915 --> 20:55.434
One thing you must see that for all such things
you cannot pay any money because you always

20:55.434 --> 20:56.434
have these from my country or from other countries.

20:56.434 --> 20:57.434
…..

20:57.434 --> 20:58.434
(unclear).

20:58.434 --> 20:59.434
Don’t go near people who ask for money,
that’s the point.

20:59.434 --> 21:01.565
You cannot pay for all these things.

21:01.565 --> 21:05.635
Formerly I used to pay for my travel everything,
… (unclear) I used to pay.

21:05.635 --> 21:08.415
But now they have said Mother we’ll look
after that, aeroplanes.

21:08.415 --> 21:09.855
All right (unclear) I can’t take money for
that.

21:09.855 --> 21:10.855
It’s invaluable.

21:10.855 --> 21:15.775
And you know Christ never took any money,
nobody took any money, now this new type of

21:15.775 --> 21:18.755
people who have come are already described
in the Bible.

21:18.755 --> 21:22.814
One should run away from that, one after another
they are coming to Australia.

21:22.814 --> 21:29.165
Whenever I came there was this Rajneesh was
there, (unclear) was there, (unclear) was

21:29.165 --> 21:33.705
there and people are so much attracted to
them because they think they are paying.

21:33.705 --> 21:35.245
Wrong idea.

21:35.245 --> 21:36.855
And then they disappear.

21:36.855 --> 21:44.565
Any person who has interest in Rolls Royce
and this kind of thing, how can people (unclear).

21:44.565 --> 21:48.675
They don’t think about it, they don’t
think.

21:48.675 --> 22:03.875
It must be told very very clearly to people,
don’t pay a single pai.

22:03.875 --> 22:06.805
And you must know the accounts, that’s the
point.

22:06.805 --> 22:11.935
Now if I am here, acually I don’t know how
these people organize, it’s among themselves.

22:11.935 --> 22:17.985
They know (unclear), they pay, they do what
they…, I mean say for example they have

22:17.985 --> 22:19.825
a program here they pay for the hall and they
know all that.

22:19.825 --> 22:23.185
I am not interested in that.

22:23.185 --> 22:32.915
Interviewer: Yes well thank you very much,
very interesting, thank you for your time.

22:32.915 --> 22:33.745
Thank you.
