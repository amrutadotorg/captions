00:02:18.644 --> 00:02:20.175
Interviewer: Is this your first visit here?

00:02:20.175 --> 00:02:21.525
Shri Mataji: Oh no.

00:02:21.525 --> 00:02:22.525
Interviewer: No?

00:02:22.525 --> 00:02:24.114
How many times have you been here before?

00:02:24.114 --> 00:02:25.114
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

00:02:25.114 --> 00:02:26.945
Interviewer: How many times have you been
here?

00:02:26.945 --> 00:02:30.415
Shri Mataji: I haven’t counted.

00:02:30.415 --> 00:02:33.515
Must be how many times?

00:02:33.515 --> 00:02:35.495
From 1974.

00:02:35.495 --> 00:02:37.485
Interviewer: Right.

00:02:37.485 --> 00:02:42.454
Shri Mataji: Practically every year.

00:02:42.454 --> 00:02:46.675
Sometimes I missed one or twice.

00:02:46.675 --> 00:02:57.155
Interviewer: And what is the main emphasis
in your teaching?

00:02:57.155 --> 00:03:17.445
Shri Mataji: To convey that within us lies
a power which we call as Kundalini in the

00:03:17.445 --> 00:03:29.844
triangular bone and when awakened, it passes
through six subtle centres through our spinal

00:03:29.844 --> 00:03:40.325
chord, our brain, ultimately into limbic area
and pierces through the fontanel bone area

00:03:40.325 --> 00:03:43.575
which was the soft bone in our childhood.

00:03:43.575 --> 00:03:52.204
This is the actualization of baptism, actualization.

00:03:52.204 --> 00:04:01.674
And this power within us is the reflection
of the Holy Ghost.

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:06.395
Thus you get your second birth, that’s how
you are twice born.

00:04:06.395 --> 00:04:08.204
Interviewer: Oh I see.

00:04:08.204 --> 00:04:10.465
Shri Mataji: Yes, born again.

00:04:10.465 --> 00:04:11.914
Interviewer: And everyone has this?

00:04:11.914 --> 00:04:12.914
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

00:04:12.914 --> 00:04:13.914
Interviewer: Everyone has this?

00:04:13.914 --> 00:04:14.914
Shri Mataji: Everyone everyone has.

00:04:14.914 --> 00:04:16.555
Interviewer: And how do people find it?

00:04:16.555 --> 00:04:19.825
Shri Mataji: I knew about it since my birth
I think.

00:04:19.825 --> 00:04:22.084
Interviewer: And what about the people you
teach?

00:04:22.084 --> 00:04:23.084
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

00:04:23.084 --> 00:04:26.545
Interviewer: The people you teach, how can
they find this power?

00:04:26.545 --> 00:04:36.575
Shri Mataji: (Unclear) They feel themselves,
the cool breeze on top of their heads.

00:04:36.575 --> 00:04:42.145
And they feel they are connected with this
power because they can feel it on their fingertips,

00:04:42.145 --> 00:04:48.685
also this power.

00:04:48.685 --> 00:04:59.985
Interviewer: And the groups you speak to,
what sort of people are they?

00:04:59.985 --> 00:05:04.865
Shri Mataji: (Unclear) Are conditioned people.

00:05:04.865 --> 00:05:12.065
Or sometimes ego is there also, lot of ego.

00:05:12.065 --> 00:05:23.945
They are not open-minded like scientists are.

00:05:23.945 --> 00:05:34.745
And they are conditioned by different faiths
and blind faiths.

00:05:34.745 --> 00:05:45.405
Interviewer: I have some information here
which says you have an emphasis on the spiritual

00:05:45.405 --> 00:05:49.025
importance of women and their role.

00:05:49.025 --> 00:05:53.265
In what way, you know how are women important
in this way?

00:05:53.265 --> 00:05:55.975
In establishing the balance of society.

00:05:55.975 --> 00:05:59.355
Shri Mataji: Because women are the potential.

00:05:59.355 --> 00:06:12.925
Men are the kinetic energy and women don’t
know how powerful they are within themselves

00:06:12.925 --> 00:06:17.085
and they try to compete with men and get frustrated.

00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:22.475
Interviewer: And how are they powerful in
this way, different from men?

00:06:22.475 --> 00:06:29.955
Shri Mataji: Because they have forbearance,
they have lot of forbearance, they are the

00:06:29.955 --> 00:06:40.585
preservers of society, they are the preservers
of family life and they create beautiful children.

00:06:40.585 --> 00:06:52.735
Motherhood is a sure thing, fatherhood is
uncertain isn’t it?

00:06:52.735 --> 00:07:06.345
Interviewer: And so you’ve travelled the
world have you, speaking to people?

00:07:06.345 --> 00:07:11.135
Shri Mataji: Yes, I don’t know how many
countries, I travel.

00:07:11.135 --> 00:07:18.635
I’ve been to Russia, to all the Eastern
block people.

00:07:18.635 --> 00:07:29.795
They seem to be very much clean about it because
they are not so conditioned and in our freedom

00:07:29.795 --> 00:07:34.075
we have lost many things which were important
to us.

00:07:34.075 --> 00:07:36.615
Interviewer: Such as?

00:07:36.615 --> 00:07:48.775
Shri Mataji: Such as chastity, innocence,
simplicity, respect.

00:07:48.775 --> 00:07:52.845
Interviewer: And how can people get these
virtues back then?

00:07:52.845 --> 00:08:02.655
Shri Mataji: Once these centres are awakened
and nourished you feel physically all right,

00:08:02.655 --> 00:08:16.595
mentally all right and your attention is filled
with the light of the Spirit and thus you’ll

00:08:16.595 --> 00:08:30.905
see what is spirituality is within yourself
and you understand your beauty.

00:08:30.905 --> 00:08:35.635
And then you enjoy your virtues, you become
religious, it’s not a question of saying

00:08:35.635 --> 00:08:40.725
I’m this religion, that religion, you just
become religious, you become.

00:08:40.725 --> 00:08:47.865
Like one may follow any religion but can do
any sins, they are equally the same, there’s

00:08:47.865 --> 00:08:52.665
no difference, it’s just a brand.

00:08:52.665 --> 00:09:03.555
Interviewer: The recent Gulf War what sort
of effect has that had on people as a whole?

00:09:03.555 --> 00:09:17.975
Shri Mataji: At least one thing is that fundamentalism
is a very dangerous thing.

00:09:17.975 --> 00:09:21.865
Any religion that gets exclusive can be very
dangerous.

00:09:21.865 --> 00:09:37.275
In Sahaja Yoga you realise that all these
prophets, incarnations, saints were born on

00:09:37.275 --> 00:09:48.815
the same tree of life or of spirituality and
we have plucked them, saying this is mine,

00:09:48.815 --> 00:09:58.085
this is mine and we are fighting with those
dead flowers.

00:09:58.085 --> 00:10:05.425
Interviewer: So how can people be helped through
your type of teaching?

00:10:05.425 --> 00:10:24.964
Shri Mataji: Because of this happening you
get completely integrated within yourself.

00:10:24.964 --> 00:10:38.404
Also all these centres which are within us
were created by these great incarnations in

00:10:38.404 --> 00:10:51.285
the evolutionary process and they are all
lined up together.

00:10:51.285 --> 00:11:03.935
Thus we realise that if this Kundalini has
to pass through we have to put them into the

00:11:03.935 --> 00:11:07.044
same garland.

00:11:07.044 --> 00:11:15.245
It’s a happening.

00:11:15.245 --> 00:11:21.055
Interviewer: And how long have you been teaching
this?

00:11:21.055 --> 00:11:23.146
Shri Mataji: I started in 1970.

00:11:23.146 --> 00:11:30.625
Interviewer: And how long did it take you
to come to this.

00:11:30.625 --> 00:11:39.435
Shri Mataji: No I started working out with
one lady to begin with in India.

00:11:39.435 --> 00:11:49.185
Then as my husband got elected to a post,
as you must have heard about, he was the Secretary

00:11:49.185 --> 00:11:54.075
General of the International Maritime Organisation
U.N..

00:11:54.075 --> 00:12:00.865
I went to London and I started with seven
hippies.

00:12:00.865 --> 00:12:08.825
They were hippies but very well educated professors
and lawyers and things like that but had become

00:12:08.825 --> 00:12:15.595
hippies just for seeking the truth.

00:12:15.595 --> 00:12:31.935
I had to work very hard on them but they are
the foundation of Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:31.935 --> 00:12:42.965
And that’s how then one of them went abroad
to some other place, it started spreading.

00:12:42.965 --> 00:12:50.405
England is a, like a heart of the universe
because everyone comes there and they carry

00:12:50.405 --> 00:12:56.095
to their own country.

00:12:56.095 --> 00:13:03.315
Interviewer: And which countries have you
been to ..

00:13:03.315 --> 00:13:08.735
would there be so many that you ..

00:13:08.735 --> 00:13:14.495
Shri Mataji: Yes, I have been at least to
forty five countries.

00:13:14.495 --> 00:13:16.415
Interviewer: Really?

00:13:16.415 --> 00:13:19.295
Shri Mataji: Yes.

00:13:19.295 --> 00:13:25.595
Interviewer: When you were working with these
people how long did it take you to come to

00:13:25.595 --> 00:13:27.035
now, to what you understand?

00:13:27.035 --> 00:13:29.335
Shri Mataji: About what?

00:13:29.335 --> 00:13:30.815
Interviewer: Your teachings.

00:13:30.815 --> 00:13:32.675
How did it come together?

00:13:32.675 --> 00:13:43.005
Shri Mataji: I see a great future, a new race
is coming up.

00:13:43.005 --> 00:14:01.735
They are devoid of all addictions, devoid
of all diseases, devoid of unchaste things,

00:14:01.735 --> 00:14:09.495
devoid of things which are wrong like they
lead a very nice married life, have nice children,

00:14:09.495 --> 00:14:12.805
absolutely angelic I would say.

00:14:12.805 --> 00:14:27.414
I don’t have to tell them anything, they
are on their own because they have evolved.

00:14:27.414 --> 00:14:32.445
This is the last breakthrough of our evolution.

00:14:32.445 --> 00:14:40.985
They are beautiful people.

00:14:40.985 --> 00:14:54.905
We have seventy five to eighty marriages every
year, all international, and except for one

00:14:54.905 --> 00:15:05.925
percent, they are all very very successful.

00:15:05.925 --> 00:15:12.235
Interviewer: And do you intend on continuing
to travel, how long do you think you will

00:15:12.235 --> 00:15:13.235
be travelling for?

00:15:13.235 --> 00:15:15.935
Shri Mataji: I can’t say, already I am sixty
eight years of age.

00:15:15.935 --> 00:15:24.555
Can’t say, as long as possible I would like
to travel because somehow they like me very

00:15:24.555 --> 00:15:28.164
much everywhere I think.

00:15:28.164 --> 00:15:34.794
Interviewer: And you obviously enjoy travelling
and speaking to people about it.

00:15:34.794 --> 00:15:36.104
Shri Mataji: Yes.

00:15:36.104 --> 00:15:37.905
Interviewer: Why do you enjoy doing it?

00:15:37.905 --> 00:15:38.905
Shri Mataji: What?

00:15:38.905 --> 00:15:41.794
Interviewer: Why do you enjoy travelling and
telling people about this?

00:15:41.794 --> 00:15:56.775
Shri Mataji: It’s so nice to see so many
getting the meaning of their life, so many

00:15:56.775 --> 00:16:07.135
getting rid of their problems and man-made
nonsense that they have on their heads.

00:16:07.135 --> 00:16:13.305
Also they are capable of giving Realizations
to others.

00:16:13.305 --> 00:16:21.525
And also if you give vibrations to your agriculture
it improves, to animals if you give it improves.

00:16:21.525 --> 00:16:30.475
Also it solves ecological problems because
they become so wise.

00:16:30.475 --> 00:16:39.974
We have to worry about the emancipation of
human beings as a whole, as a whole because

00:16:39.974 --> 00:16:56.354
we are one world and they all feel they are
citizens of the universe.

00:16:56.354 --> 00:17:04.544
And the love they have, respect they have
for each other and the silence they enjoy

00:17:04.544 --> 00:17:12.284
shows that we’ll have no more wars, no more
problems and we’ll always abide in the beautiful

00:17:12.284 --> 00:17:17.405
realm of kingdom of God.

00:17:17.405 --> 00:17:22.724
It’s the greatest satisfaction anybody can.

00:17:22.724 --> 00:17:29.645
This cannot be given by money, power, anything.

00:17:29.645 --> 00:17:42.075
When I leave one country I feel very much
wrenched, as if my heart is being wrenched

00:17:42.075 --> 00:17:47.284
because I feel that I am leaving all of them
there, but when I reach another country I

00:17:47.284 --> 00:17:55.595
see again beautiful flower-like faces.

00:17:55.595 --> 00:17:58.745
This is what all the incarnations wanted.

00:17:58.745 --> 00:18:08.844
We have no organisation as such, I have no
secretary, nothing.

00:18:08.844 --> 00:18:13.325
It’s like a stateless state you can call
it.

00:18:13.325 --> 00:18:26.375
And we have no problems, we just enjoy that’s
all.

00:18:26.375 --> 00:18:30.475
Pure enjoyment.

00:18:30.475 --> 00:18:37.425
Interviewer: Thank you very much for your
time, it’s been very interesting, thank

00:18:37.425 --> 00:18:38.425
you.

00:18:38.425 --> 00:18:47.345
Shri Mataji: You are so intelligent I must
say, I thought you are a little girl, she’s

00:18:47.345 --> 00:18:48.755
very intelligent.

00:18:48.755 --> 00:18:53.755
Yesterday I was in New Zealand talking to
the interviewer, with the gentleman interviewing,

00:18:53.755 --> 00:19:00.034
he felt the cool breeze in his hands immediately
and he came to my program also.

00:19:00.034 --> 00:19:04.335
Interviewer: Thank you.

00:19:04.335 --> 00:19:14.375
Shri Mataji: Want to take a photograph?

00:19:14.375 --> 00:19:15.805
(Unclear).

00:19:15.805 --> 00:19:30.145
Sahaja Yogi: She’s got it Shri Mataji, she’s
got it.

00:19:30.145 --> 00:19:36.935
Shri Mataji: She’s got it.

00:19:36.935 --> 00:19:55.324
First time
I met (unclear) in Australia.

00:19:55.324 --> 00:19:59.465
They cannot see subtler things, that’s the
trouble is.

00:19:59.465 --> 00:20:03.615
And they also find it’s not so sensational.

00:20:03.615 --> 00:20:15.295
It’s the most sensational thing don’t
you think so?

00:20:15.295 --> 00:20:32.025
It’s for the betterment of the whole world,
the most sensational thing.

00:20:32.025 --> 00:20:40.735
It’s a silent revolution, peaceful revolution
that’s coming.

00:20:40.735 --> 00:20:46.175
Has to come after all.

00:20:46.175 --> 00:20:51.915
We are waiting for a shock all over.

00:20:51.915 --> 00:20:55.434
One thing you must see that for all such things
you cannot pay any money because you always

00:20:55.434 --> 00:20:56.434
have these from my country or from other countries.

00:20:56.434 --> 00:20:57.434
…..

00:20:57.434 --> 00:20:58.434
(unclear).

00:20:58.434 --> 00:20:59.434
Don’t go near people who ask for money,
that’s the point.

00:20:59.434 --> 00:21:01.565
You cannot pay for all these things.

00:21:01.565 --> 00:21:05.635
Formerly I used to pay for my travel everything,
… (unclear) I used to pay.

00:21:05.635 --> 00:21:08.415
But now they have said Mother we’ll look
after that, aeroplanes.

00:21:08.415 --> 00:21:09.855
All right (unclear) I can’t take money for
that.

00:21:09.855 --> 00:21:10.855
It’s invaluable.

00:21:10.855 --> 00:21:15.775
And you know Christ never took any money,
nobody took any money, now this new type of

00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:18.755
people who have come are already described
in the Bible.

00:21:18.755 --> 00:21:22.814
One should run away from that, one after another
they are coming to Australia.

00:21:22.814 --> 00:21:29.165
Whenever I came there was this Rajneesh was
there, (unclear) was there, (unclear) was

00:21:29.165 --> 00:21:33.705
there and people are so much attracted to
them because they think they are paying.

00:21:33.705 --> 00:21:35.245
Wrong idea.

00:21:35.245 --> 00:21:36.855
And then they disappear.

00:21:36.855 --> 00:21:44.565
Any person who has interest in Rolls Royce
and this kind of thing, how can people (unclear).

00:21:44.565 --> 00:21:48.675
They don’t think about it, they don’t
think.

00:21:48.675 --> 00:22:03.875
It must be told very very clearly to people,
don’t pay a single pai.

00:22:03.875 --> 00:22:06.805
And you must know the accounts, that’s the
point.

00:22:06.805 --> 00:22:11.935
Now if I am here, acually I don’t know how
these people organize, it’s among themselves.

00:22:11.935 --> 00:22:17.985
They know (unclear), they pay, they do what
they…, I mean say for example they have

00:22:17.985 --> 00:22:19.825
a program here they pay for the hall and they
know all that.

00:22:19.825 --> 00:22:23.185
I am not interested in that.

00:22:23.185 --> 00:22:32.915
Interviewer: Yes well thank you very much,
very interesting, thank you for your time.

00:22:32.915 --> 00:22:33.745
Thank you.
