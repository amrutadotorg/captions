00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.373
[MUSIC - BHAJAN]

00:00:08.373 --> 00:00:16.349
[MUSIC - BHAJAN]

00:00:16.377 --> 00:00:24.307
[MUSIC - BHAJAN]

00:00:24.307 --> 00:00:32.607
[MUSIC - BHAJAN]

00:00:32.628 --> 00:00:40.628
[MUSIC - BHAJAN]

00:00:40.628 --> 00:00:48.560
[MUSIC - BHAJAN]

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:58.659
[MUSIC - BHAJAN]

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:04.606
[MUSIC - BHAJAN]

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.000
- I bow to all the seekers of Truth.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:13.241
At the very outset we have to know
that Truth is what it is.

00:02:14.438 --> 00:02:20.194
[INTERPRETER]

00:02:21.242 --> 00:02:25.092
- We cannot change it.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:02:26.323 --> 00:02:33.513
- It is, it has been and it will be.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:02:36.707 --> 00:02:40.647
- Whatever I'm going to tell you,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:50.630
- you have to have a scientific mind towards it.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:02:51.927 --> 00:02:56.527
- Keep your mind open.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:02:56.751 --> 00:03:06.291
and whatever I say to you, if it is proved,
then you have to believe in it as honest people.

00:03:06.291 --> 00:03:12.920
[INTERPRETER]

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:26.831
The Truth is, that you are not this body,
this mind, these conditionings and this ego

00:03:27.132 --> 00:03:34.692
[INTERPRETER]

00:03:35.234 --> 00:03:40.184
- but you are the Pure Spirit.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:03:40.517 --> 00:03:49.537
- This is said by all the great prophets,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.280
- by Incarnations,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:03:55.582 --> 00:04:01.342
- by Muhammad Sahab as well as our Christ,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:04:01.485 --> 00:04:04.765
- as well as by Moses
- [INTERPRETER]

00:04:05.184 --> 00:04:11.454
- also all Indian scriptures say the same.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:04:12.098 --> 00:04:18.048
The second Truth is, that there is a
All-Pervading Divine Power

00:04:18.236 --> 00:04:22.166
[INTERPRETER]

00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:27.381
and this Divine Power does
all the living work.

00:04:27.381 --> 00:04:32.682
[INTERPRETER]

00:04:33.104 --> 00:04:38.034
- You see all the beautiful flowers here
- [INTERPRETER]

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.130
- it's a miracle.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.919
- They have come out of one seed
- [INTERPRETER]

00:04:49.237 --> 00:04:54.977
- Our heart - who runs our heart?
- [INTERPRETER]

00:04:55.292 --> 00:04:59.052
We don't even bother to know
who runs our heart.

00:04:59.124 --> 00:05:04.274
[INTERPRETER]

00:05:07.415 --> 00:05:12.505
This All-Pervading Power of Divine Love,
runs our heart.

00:05:13.131 --> 00:05:18.381
[INTERPRETER]

00:05:19.034 --> 00:05:28.414
- It's like the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost
- [INTERPRETER]

00:05:28.468 --> 00:05:35.058
- or it is the Paramchaitanya
- [INTERPRETER]

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.210
- or it is the Rooh
- It's what?

00:05:39.313 --> 00:05:44.513
- Rooh, in Koran
- [INTERPRETER]

00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:51.341
- It is described by many names.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:05:51.811 --> 00:05:58.446
Those who are seekers of Truth, are
actually seeking the connection with this

00:05:58.448 --> 00:06:06.818
- All-Pervading Power.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:06:06.818 --> 00:06:13.476
This connection is called as Yoga
- the real Spiritual Yoga.

00:06:13.476 --> 00:06:17.499
[INTERPRETER]

00:06:17.533 --> 00:06:27.723
- It is not standing on your head
- [INTERPRETER]

00:06:27.723 --> 00:06:32.291
- or stretching your legs
- [INTERPRETER]

00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:37.006
- that it is a yoga
- [INTERPRETER]

00:06:37.226 --> 00:06:48.662
Even the taking the name of God, of 
praying to God, is not manifested unless

00:06:48.662 --> 00:06:54.522
and until you have the connection with 
this All-Pervading Power of Divine Love.

00:06:54.537 --> 00:07:00.287
[INTERPRETER]

00:07:00.287 --> 00:07:06.899
[INTERPRETER]

00:07:06.935 --> 00:07:12.245
- As this instrument
- [INTERPRETER]

00:07:12.425 --> 00:07:19.222
- when not connected with the mains,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:07:19.222 --> 00:07:22.031
- it has no meaning,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:07:22.036 --> 00:07:25.486
- it has no identity.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:07:25.518 --> 00:07:30.488
- In the same way, we the human-beings,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:07:30.488 --> 00:07:34.378
- if we are not connected,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:07:34.492 --> 00:07:41.052
- to the All-Pervading Divine Power,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:07:41.052 --> 00:07:45.231
- we have no meaning.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:07:45.233 --> 00:07:49.763
- We cannot have Self-Knowledge,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:07:49.763 --> 00:07:59.351
- we cannot have the Enlightenment
- [INTERPRETER]

00:07:59.351 --> 00:08:07.836
- and we cannot know the Absolute Truth.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:08:08.866 --> 00:08:14.490
- Most of the human problems
- [INTERPRETER]

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:20.714
- are created problems of the world
- [INTERPRETER]

00:08:22.284 --> 00:08:30.334
and most of the human problems come to us
from these centers when they go into jeopardy.

00:08:30.334 --> 00:08:40.454
[INTERPRETER]

00:08:41.095 --> 00:08:47.045
- All these subtle centers are within us.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:08:47.376 --> 00:08:52.836
In the Bible it is mentioned that, "I'll 
appear before you like tongues of flames."

00:08:53.176 --> 00:08:59.696
[INTERPRETER]

00:08:59.696 --> 00:09:06.717
In every scripture it is described
the life, the Tree of Life.

00:09:06.764 --> 00:09:12.564
[INTERPRETER]

00:09:12.904 --> 00:09:17.014
but nobody has tried to find
out what is this.

00:09:17.014 --> 00:09:20.121
[INTERPRETER]

00:09:21.488 --> 00:09:26.038
The civilization, in the West,
has grown very much

00:09:26.038 --> 00:09:31.087
[INTERPRETER]

00:09:31.087 --> 00:09:35.358
- but it has to find out it's roots
- [INTERPRETER]

00:09:35.358 --> 00:09:40.621
- roots of Spirituality
- [INTERPRETER]

00:09:40.621 --> 00:09:49.421
otherwise this whole big civilization
will be completely dissolved.

00:09:49.441 --> 00:09:54.081
[INTERPRETER]

00:09:54.643 --> 00:10:01.703
As it is, you can see what's happening in
the most developed countries like America

00:10:01.703 --> 00:10:07.195
[INTERPRETER]

00:10:07.304 --> 00:10:12.234
Thousands and thousands of people
are suffering from AIDS,

00:10:12.309 --> 00:10:15.769
[INTERPRETER]

00:10:16.339 --> 00:10:20.543
- they are suffering from schizophrenia
- [INTERPRETER]

00:10:20.543 --> 00:10:27.035
- and the violence is at it's worst.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:10:28.119 --> 00:10:33.039
- You can't even wear a wedding ring
- [INTERPRETER]

00:10:33.039 --> 00:10:41.441
- and walk in the streets of New York
- [INTERPRETER]

00:10:41.996 --> 00:10:46.726
- Such greed and such lust!
- [INTERPRETER]

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.840
- No morality of any kind
- [INTERPRETER]

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:59.241
It's not only there but you 
see it all over your world.

00:10:59.241 --> 00:11:03.461
[INTERPRETER]

00:11:03.461 --> 00:11:10.094
At all developing countries, who have 
taken to this modern life, like Argentina

00:11:10.716 --> 00:11:20.086
- also are in the same [UNCLEAR]
- [INTERPRETER]

00:11:20.285 --> 00:11:25.245
- but once we find our roots,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:11:25.245 --> 00:11:29.665
- once we find our identity,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:11:30.781 --> 00:11:36.551
- you understand how great you are.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:11:36.595 --> 00:11:42.535
- You understand why you were created,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:47.226
- what is the purpose of your life,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:11:47.226 --> 00:11:52.105
- what is the goal of your life;
- [INTERPRETER]

00:11:53.135 --> 00:11:58.355
Is only possible when you have
your second birth.

00:11:58.355 --> 00:12:05.488
[INTERPRETER]

00:12:05.488 --> 00:12:12.893
- Many people brand them as twice born
- [INTERPRETER]

00:12:12.893 --> 00:12:16.559
- Sorry, once more.
- as twice born - born twice

00:12:16.559 --> 00:12:26.208
- [INTERPRETER]
- but they are not - but they are not at all.

00:12:26.498 --> 00:12:36.343
- [INTERPRETER]
- Those, who call themselves as Muslims

00:12:36.343 --> 00:12:44.310
- and Christians and Hindus, are not
- [INTERPRETER]

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:50.770
If they were real Christians, they would
not have taken to this immoral life

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:59.740
[INTERPRETER]

00:13:01.084 --> 00:13:08.174
- How could such immoral life exist then
- [INTERPRETER]

00:13:08.174 --> 00:13:13.159
- in the name of Christ!
- [INTERPRETER]

00:13:13.159 --> 00:13:18.339
Who said, "Thou shalt not have
adulterous eyes!"

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:23.001
[INTERPRETER]

00:13:23.001 --> 00:13:31.322
- What subtle morality! What deep morality!
- [INTERPRETER]

00:13:33.587 --> 00:13:43.387
- That's only possible if you are enlightened
- [INTERPRETER]

00:13:43.594 --> 00:13:48.154
- When the light comes within you,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:13:48.213 --> 00:13:52.173
- immediately you give up
- [INTERPRETER]

00:13:52.173 --> 00:13:57.441
- whatever is destructive,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:13:57.441 --> 00:14:05.011
- whatever is destructive within you
- [INTERPRETER]

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:09.591
and also you see what is outside
is destructive

00:14:09.591 --> 00:14:13.400
[INTERPRETER]

00:14:14.383 --> 00:14:19.053
- Once you get your enlightenment,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:14:19.053 --> 00:14:24.236
you can feel this All-Pervading Power, for
the first time, on your finger-tips

00:14:24.236 --> 00:14:30.785
[INTERPRETER]

00:14:30.785 --> 00:14:37.861
You see also the cool breeze coming out of
your fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone

00:14:37.861 --> 00:14:44.531
[INTERPRETER]

00:14:44.531 --> 00:14:52.800
- Is the actualization of your baptism
- [INTERPRETER]

00:14:52.800 --> 00:15:00.463
Then you start using this power and you
can give realizations to others.

00:15:00.463 --> 00:15:04.466
[INTERPRETER]

00:15:04.466 --> 00:15:14.054
As a result of this, you get physical,
mental, emotional, spiritual problems solved.

00:15:14.851 --> 00:15:23.121
[INTERPRETER]

00:15:23.291 --> 00:15:27.803
I don't have to tell you, don't do this,
don't do that, don't do that.

00:15:27.803 --> 00:15:32.073
[INTERPRETER]

00:15:32.073 --> 00:15:37.193
With the light of the Spirit you yourself 
become your own guide, your own master,

00:15:37.193 --> 00:15:43.547
- your own guru.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:15:43.588 --> 00:15:48.558
You become extremely dynamic but 
extremely compassionate.

00:15:48.558 --> 00:15:57.396
[INTERPRETER]

00:15:57.396 --> 00:16:01.276
You can feel your own centers
on your finger-tips.

00:16:01.276 --> 00:16:07.998
[INTERPRETER]

00:16:07.998 --> 00:16:12.741
Then you see all religions belong
to the same tree of life.

00:16:12.741 --> 00:16:17.604
[INTERPRETER]

00:16:17.604 --> 00:16:21.930
- All beautiful flowers
- [INTERPRETER]

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:24.902
- of Divinity
- [INTERPRETER]

00:16:24.902 --> 00:16:33.002
but people have taken out these flowers
and now fighting with the dead flowers.

00:16:33.002 --> 00:16:39.332
[INTERPRETER]

00:16:39.592 --> 00:16:49.559
And all these religions are one; 
They have the same business

00:16:49.772 --> 00:16:55.272
[INTERPRETER]

00:16:55.296 --> 00:17:00.026
There is no need at all to fight
in the name of God.

00:17:00.026 --> 00:17:04.895
[INTERPRETER]

00:17:05.826 --> 00:17:12.886
This you can know as a scientific
proof after realization.

00:17:12.919 --> 00:17:18.699
[INTERPRETER]

00:17:20.326 --> 00:17:26.596
You can feel on your finger-tips
the centers of others.

00:17:26.906 --> 00:17:34.006
[INTERPRETER]

00:17:34.006 --> 00:17:41.764
Now if you know how to correct them, you can
correct your centers as well as the of others.

00:17:41.764 --> 00:17:45.312
[INTERPRETER]

00:17:47.266 --> 00:17:54.156
- You develop a peaceful heart
- [INTERPRETER]

00:17:54.251 --> 00:17:59.441
- and tremendous compassion.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:17:59.877 --> 00:18:04.897
You realize then how great your are - 
all your virtues start manifesting.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:10.910
[INTERPRETER]

00:18:11.113 --> 00:18:15.113
- It is your own power -
- [INTERPRETER]

00:18:15.353 --> 00:18:19.353
- it's your own.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:18:19.418 --> 00:18:22.948
- You all have it within you
- [INTERPRETER]

00:18:23.195 --> 00:18:27.595
- and you don't have to pay for it
- [INTERPRETER]

00:18:27.595 --> 00:18:35.115
- God doesn't understand banks.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:38.575
- He doesn't understand money.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:18:38.575 --> 00:18:42.575
- It's a human [UNCLEAR]
- [INTERPRETER]

00:18:42.575 --> 00:18:47.935
By reading about it, you do not
get to that point

00:18:47.935 --> 00:18:51.655
[INTERPRETER]

00:18:52.492 --> 00:18:59.172
- You have to seek and you will find.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:18:59.254 --> 00:19:05.484
- I call it a blossom time
- [INTERPRETER]

00:19:05.484 --> 00:19:10.184
Time when there are so many
great souls are born.

00:19:10.184 --> 00:19:15.754
[INTERPRETER]

00:19:15.754 --> 00:19:24.089
- This is the fulfillment of the last judgment
- [INTERPRETER]

00:19:24.089 --> 00:19:27.699
The dead bodies are not going
to come to life.

00:19:27.699 --> 00:19:30.499
[INTERPRETER]

00:19:30.499 --> 00:19:35.149
I mean to say, all the prehistoric people
and the dinosaurs all of them

00:19:35.149 --> 00:19:41.469
- are going to come to life?
- [INTERPRETER]

00:19:41.848 --> 00:19:45.848
But all those, who were dead,
their souls will take birth

00:19:46.005 --> 00:19:52.310
[INTERPRETER]

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:56.310
- as human beings.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:19:56.310 --> 00:20:04.880
- That's why we have a population problem
- [INTERPRETER]

00:20:05.142 --> 00:20:12.672
So many great souls, we have
seen, born as children.

00:20:12.812 --> 00:20:19.182
[INTERPRETER]

00:20:19.182 --> 00:20:33.352
I've seen children at the age of 6 and 10,
can play on violin or on piano like a master.

00:20:33.352 --> 00:20:40.787
[INTERPRETER]

00:20:40.827 --> 00:20:47.322
In India I've seen children below 10 years, 
singing the Indian music, which is very difficult,

00:20:47.322 --> 00:20:54.116
- like great masters of old times.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:20:54.116 --> 00:20:58.116
[INTERPRETER]

00:20:58.124 --> 00:21:03.824
Today only, I saw in the television, in 
France there were children - very small children

00:21:03.824 --> 00:21:14.652
- playing on the violin
- [INTERPRETER]

00:21:14.726 --> 00:21:20.846
- in such a, in such a mastery.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:21:20.846 --> 00:21:25.806
So these are the times, when all these
great people are going to be born.

00:21:25.806 --> 00:21:29.806
[INTERPRETER]

00:21:29.806 --> 00:21:35.086
There are some people, who are frightening
to say that, this world is going to come

00:21:35.086 --> 00:21:41.086
- to an end.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:21:41.086 --> 00:21:44.176
- Don't believe that.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:21:44.176 --> 00:21:48.176
- The One, who is our Creator,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:21:48.176 --> 00:21:51.885
- is our Father,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:21:51.885 --> 00:21:59.905
- is the Supreme Being of compassion.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:21:59.905 --> 00:22:02.873
He has not created this world
to be destroyed

00:22:02.873 --> 00:22:05.833
[INTERPRETER]

00:22:06.194 --> 00:22:15.834
but He has made places, for all of you,
in the Kingdom of God.

00:22:15.927 --> 00:22:23.077
[INTERPRETER]

00:22:23.414 --> 00:22:29.874
Don't be eluded by people - some of them
are coming even from India and trying

00:22:29.874 --> 00:22:40.354
- to put conditionings in your heads.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:22:40.496 --> 00:22:44.496
The other day, I met somebody
from this Hare Rama business.

00:22:44.496 --> 00:22:49.856
[INTERPRETER]

00:22:50.008 --> 00:22:55.898
- They are absolutely stupid, idiotic people.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:22:58.878 --> 00:23:05.668
If you have to call the name of your 
Prime Minister here, near his house,

00:23:05.668 --> 00:23:13.948
- you'll be arrested
- [INTERPRETER]

00:23:13.948 --> 00:23:20.168
and you are calling the name of God
without any protocol, without any

00:23:20.168 --> 00:23:26.878
- permission, without any connection.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:23:26.902 --> 00:23:34.592
- You might only get cancer of throat.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:23:34.592 --> 00:23:38.932
- I don't know what other punishments.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:23:38.932 --> 00:23:42.612
I must say, Russians were very clever.
They said, "We had no food Mother,

00:23:42.612 --> 00:23:46.612
so we had nice food from them and now 
they have gone away permanently.

00:23:47.152 --> 00:23:56.572
- Mother, [UNCLEAR] 
- I said that Russians were very clever

00:23:56.623 --> 00:24:04.353
and they said that, "These people had 
brought food so we ate the food nicely and

00:24:04.355 --> 00:24:08.705
now they have gone away completely." They
have completely gone from Russia.

00:24:10.316 --> 00:24:12.286
- Did you follow?
- No

00:24:12.286 --> 00:24:16.076
The Russians was very clever because 
this [UNCLEAR]

00:24:16.076 --> 00:24:27.249
Ah! [INTERPRETER]

00:24:27.249 --> 00:24:31.559
- I think, the IQ of Russian is very high
- Eh...

00:24:31.559 --> 00:24:35.559
- IQ.
- Shri Mataji [INTERPRETER]

00:24:35.576 --> 00:24:41.396
They said, "Mother, we could make
out they are idiotic, stupid things

00:24:41.396 --> 00:24:48.986
- they were telling us."
- Shri Mataji [INTERPRETER]

00:24:49.198 --> 00:24:53.518
In you, Sahaja yoga is not meant
for stupid, idiotic people.

00:24:53.518 --> 00:25:03.878
- [INTERPRETER]
- So, one has to understand and think,

00:25:06.304 --> 00:25:12.504
- we talk of God
- [INTERPRETER]

00:25:12.514 --> 00:25:17.249
and why all these horrible things are
happening in the name of God.

00:25:17.249 --> 00:25:21.305
[INTERPRETER]

00:25:22.763 --> 00:25:26.013
- What's gone wrong?
- [INTERPRETER]

00:25:27.106 --> 00:25:30.436
The mistake is, that we are not
yet connected.

00:25:31.302 --> 00:25:41.452
- [INTERPRETER]
- This is what we have to achieve the connection

00:25:41.452 --> 00:25:46.510
- [INTERPRETER]
- which is sahaja - means spontaneous.

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:53.310
- [INTERPRETER]
- Sahaja - 'Saha' means with, 'ja' is born

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:59.271
- [INTERPRETER]
- What's the matter with this gentleman?

00:26:04.145 --> 00:26:07.935
- [INTERPRETER]
- you see, you are little bit disturbing

00:26:10.042 --> 00:26:15.192
because they all start watching him. 
Please make yourself comfortable.

00:26:17.294 --> 00:26:23.524
[INTERPRETER] He's 
[UNCLEAR] Mother.

00:26:23.524 --> 00:26:28.544
But he's going round, putting up, everybody
looking at him; You see, the [UNCLEAR]

00:26:31.825 --> 00:26:40.105
- Alright! I don't know how to tell you
- [INTERPRETER]

00:26:42.683 --> 00:26:49.063
How the time has come for you to 
specially, to achieve this state

00:26:49.897 --> 00:26:54.897
[INTERPRETER]

00:26:54.897 --> 00:27:00.477
- through your evolutionary process,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:27:00.778 --> 00:27:06.758
through this awakening of this Kundalini,
the power in your triangular bone.

00:27:06.804 --> 00:27:11.844
[INTERPRETER]

00:27:12.571 --> 00:27:16.801
- This bone is called as Sacrum
- [INTERPRETER]

00:27:17.057 --> 00:27:25.287
- that means, the Greeks knew it is a sacred bone.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:37.200
- Athena, itself, means Primordial Mother
- [INTERPRETER]

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:42.220
- so, Greeks believed in all that.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:49.910
- and now there's a big upsurge in Greece also
- [INTERPRETER]

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:55.540
- to take to their ancient knowledge
- [INTERPRETER]

00:27:55.540 --> 00:28:08.380
- because they're so restless, so frustrated
- [INTERPRETER]

00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:14.429
So, time has come for you all also 
to have your Self-realization.

00:28:14.429 --> 00:28:18.429
[INTERPRETER]

00:28:18.839 --> 00:28:25.729
- Of course, I cannot force it on you
- [INTERPRETER]

00:28:25.729 --> 00:28:30.469
- I respect your freedom
- [INTERPRETER]

00:28:30.469 --> 00:28:36.279
- Those, who want to have it, can have it
- [INTERPRETER]

00:28:36.279 --> 00:28:46.689
- but you must have a very ardent desire
- [INTERPRETER]

00:28:50.267 --> 00:28:55.547
Those, who do not want to have, please
leave the hall - we'll be very happy.

00:28:55.547 --> 00:29:01.267
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:09.657 --> 00:29:13.647
- This person, Hare Rama fellow
- but he'll sit down

00:29:13.843 --> 00:29:16.423
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:24.550
- It's very critical to make them understand
- [INTERPRETER]

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:30.870
Such conditioning people have that
it's impossible to break free.

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:34.870
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:41.250
Only people, who are really introspective,
were Russians.

00:29:42.039 --> 00:29:48.849
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:50.385 --> 00:29:59.275
We always had programs in a big, 
what you call, auditoriums or places

00:29:59.275 --> 00:30:01.715
where there were 16,000 people.

00:30:01.715 --> 00:30:09.135
[INTERPRETER]

00:30:09.135 --> 00:30:13.055
They're so well read and they 
know so much about it

00:30:13.055 --> 00:30:17.055
[INTERPRETER]

00:30:17.055 --> 00:30:20.845
- and they're so introspective
- [INTERPRETER]

00:30:20.845 --> 00:30:23.935
- It's very surprising
- [INTERPRETER]

00:30:26.334 --> 00:30:34.144
- and now we have in thousands in Russia
- [INTERPRETER]

00:30:34.144 --> 00:30:37.728
- Also in Romania
- [INTERPRETER]

00:30:37.728 --> 00:30:39.938
- and Bulgaria
- [INTERPRETER]

00:30:39.938 --> 00:30:49.308
- Czechoslovakia but Poland somehow is not
- [INTERPRETER]

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:55.370
- I don't know, what is the conditioning
- [INTERPRETER]

00:30:57.263 --> 00:30:59.493
- Why?
- [INTERPRETER]

00:31:05.101 --> 00:31:13.061
- So, I know you all have lots of questions
- [INTERPRETER]

00:31:13.814 --> 00:31:18.694
I would like you to write it down
and send it over to Me

00:31:18.694 --> 00:31:25.254
[INTERPRETER]

00:31:25.254 --> 00:31:29.834
- and I'll try to answer them.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:31:29.834 --> 00:31:33.094
But just now, I think, you all should
get your realization.

00:31:33.094 --> 00:31:37.344
- [INTERPRETER]

00:31:37.344 --> 00:31:44.724
You see, it is such an ocean of knowledge
that in this short time I cannot

00:31:44.724 --> 00:31:52.094
- tell you everything.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:31:55.348 --> 00:32:06.598
You have to understand that these lights that
are here have been brought long time back

00:32:06.598 --> 00:32:14.278
[INTERPRETER]

00:32:14.278 --> 00:32:22.718
and to explain to you about all these lights
and how electricity came, is such a headache.

00:32:22.718 --> 00:32:31.598
[INTERPRETER]

00:32:31.598 --> 00:32:35.598
- It's all built-in now
- [INTERPRETER]

00:32:35.598 --> 00:32:43.158
- You have to just put one switch and they are on
- [INTERPRETER]

00:32:43.787 --> 00:32:48.037
You don't have to tell them all the
history of electricity

00:32:48.037 --> 00:32:53.367
[INTERPRETER]

00:32:54.584 --> 00:32:59.874
-So, it's a headache also
- [INTERPRETER]

00:33:00.411 --> 00:33:09.381
If you have your light because it is built-in
within you - the system is built-in within you

00:33:09.381 --> 00:33:16.511
- [INTERPRETER]

00:33:16.511 --> 00:33:19.801
- It's all there
- [INTERPRETER]

00:33:20.151 --> 00:33:24.701
- so better to have your enlightenment
- [INTERPRETER]

00:33:25.035 --> 00:33:30.765
- and then talk about the rest of it
- [INTERPRETER]

00:33:34.029 --> 00:33:38.291
- You can come here - there's some room
- [INTERPRETER]

00:33:38.291 --> 00:33:43.981
- So, everybody should be seated down
- [INTERPRETER]

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:05.950
Now ask him to take away the film because
we're going to meditate and it might disturb.

00:34:05.957 --> 00:34:08.167
[INTERPRETER]

00:34:08.171 --> 00:34:12.171
Some one should go and tell. 
Better to go there.

00:34:12.171 --> 00:34:14.873
- [INTERPRETER]
- He won't disturb you.

00:34:16.095 --> 00:34:23.295
If he's seated, it's alright. [UNCLEAR]
he'll be a point disturbing people.

00:34:25.527 --> 00:34:33.207
[INTERPRETER]

00:34:33.207 --> 00:34:37.207
Ask him to go out. I think,
he's finished - if you don't mind.

00:34:37.207 --> 00:34:44.657
[INTERPRETER]

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:56.730
- Thank you.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:35:12.353 --> 00:35:15.283
Very obedient!

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:48.010
- It will hardly take 10 to 15 minutes
- [INTERPRETER]

00:35:49.133 --> 00:35:56.966
- just to enter into the Kingdom of God
- [INTERPRETER]

00:35:57.296 --> 00:36:02.731
- which is the ocean of joy.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:36:03.566 --> 00:36:12.786
We come out of, like a pond into,
blossoming into a beautiful lotuses

00:36:12.786 --> 00:36:22.586
[INTERPRETER]

00:36:22.586 --> 00:36:25.996
- because you are that.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:34.320
- So, we have three conditions
- [INTERPRETER]

00:36:34.941 --> 00:36:39.261
- Want to sit down, come along - don't stand
- [INTERPRETER]

00:36:40.392 --> 00:36:42.672
- in the door;
- [INTERPRETER]

00:36:43.652 --> 00:36:46.112
There is room for you here, if you want.

00:36:57.387 --> 00:37:00.367
- Please be seated.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:37:04.059 --> 00:37:07.309
- The first condition
- [INTERPRETER]

00:37:08.097 --> 00:37:14.917
is that you should have full
confidence in yourself.

00:37:14.917 --> 00:37:19.320
[INTERPRETER]

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:26.530
You must have full faith that today, tonight
you are going to get your Self-realization.

00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:31.940
[INTERPRETER]

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:40.000
- In no way you should feel tempted
- [INTERPRETER]

00:37:42.075 --> 00:37:45.895
- The second condition is
- [INTERPRETER]

00:37:46.272 --> 00:37:59.792
- that you are not to feel guilty about anything.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:38:00.308 --> 00:38:05.658
Like yesterday, somebody told Me that, "Mother,
I have harmed somebody, so I'm feeling guilty."

00:38:05.658 --> 00:38:11.818
[INTERPRETER]

00:38:11.818 --> 00:38:15.448
- What is the use?
- [INTERPRETER]

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:19.204
If you have harmed somebody,
then go and tell that person.

00:38:19.273 --> 00:38:23.333
[INTERPRETER]

00:38:23.333 --> 00:38:26.953
- and tell to yourself,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:38:26.953 --> 00:38:32.673
- face your mistakes
- [INTERPRETER]

00:38:32.673 --> 00:38:37.713
but if you feel guilty, then the guilt 
goes here in the left side of your center.

00:38:37.713 --> 00:38:45.243
[INTERPRETER]

00:38:45.243 --> 00:38:53.263
- and you develop horrible diseases like angina,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:38:53.263 --> 00:38:56.803
- spondylitis,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:38:57.559 --> 00:39:03.489
- also lethargy problems
- [INTERPRETER]

00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:10.346
- So, no use feeling guilty
- [INTERPRETER]

00:39:10.346 --> 00:39:18.916
- It's like avoiding the reality.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:39:18.916 --> 00:39:28.266
- At least at this time, please, forget your past.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:39:28.279 --> 00:39:33.653
- Your past doesn't exist
- [INTERPRETER]

00:39:33.653 --> 00:39:35.903
- it's finished
- [INTERPRETER]

00:39:36.184 --> 00:39:42.064
- and your future also doesn't exist
- [INTERPRETER]

00:39:42.064 --> 00:39:47.034
- The reality is in the present
- [INTERPRETER]

00:39:47.034 --> 00:39:53.664
That's what will happen to you that
you will come into present.

00:39:53.664 --> 00:39:59.014
[INTERPRETER]

00:39:59.232 --> 00:40:03.922
We are all the time thinking
about the past or the future.

00:40:03.922 --> 00:40:07.692
[INTERPRETER]

00:40:07.692 --> 00:40:13.562
- Jumping from past to future, future to past
- [INTERPRETER]

00:40:13.562 --> 00:40:19.252
- These thoughts come in
- [INTERPRETER]

00:40:19.252 --> 00:40:24.162
but in between these thoughts there's a
little, little space for the present.

00:40:24.162 --> 00:40:30.192
[INTERPRETER]

00:40:30.192 --> 00:40:37.882
which increases in size and you
become thoughtlessly aware.

00:40:37.891 --> 00:40:43.411
[INTERPRETER]

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:47.930
You are absolutely aware but it's no
thought - complete peace

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:52.900
[INTERPRETER]

00:40:57.241 --> 00:41:04.081
The second, I told you, that you become
Collectively Conscious because you can feel

00:41:04.081 --> 00:41:12.601
- the centers of others.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:41:12.601 --> 00:41:19.511
- [INTERPRETER]
- So, the microcosm becomes the macrocosm.

00:41:20.061 --> 00:41:25.201
- [INTERPRETER]
- Micra is better to tell

00:41:25.201 --> 00:41:28.501
- [INTERPRETER]
- Alright.

00:41:30.337 --> 00:41:37.277
- We become part and parcel of the Whole
- [INTERPRETER]

00:41:37.277 --> 00:41:42.097
- A drop becomes the ocean
- [INTERPRETER]

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:53.570
Sahaja yoga is working in 55 nations and you will 
have brothers and sisters in all these 55 nations.

00:41:53.570 --> 00:42:00.742
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:08.520
- So please, don't feel guilty
- [INTERPRETER]

00:42:10.019 --> 00:42:13.469
Those who tell you, you are sinners
and all that - forget them.

00:42:13.469 --> 00:42:18.708
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:18.708 --> 00:42:26.158
- Those who condemn you, forgive them.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:42:28.096 --> 00:42:34.486
- I'll tell you, you are not guilty.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:41.680
- Absolutely, no question.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:42:42.377 --> 00:42:48.117
And the third condition is,
that you have to forgive

00:42:48.117 --> 00:42:52.117
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:52.117 --> 00:42:55.157
- Forgive everyone.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:42:55.157 --> 00:42:58.847
Whether you forgive or don't forgive,
you don't do anything

00:42:58.847 --> 00:43:04.314
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:04.314 --> 00:43:07.744
- but if you don't forgive
- [INTERPRETER]

00:43:07.744 --> 00:43:12.984
- then you play into wrong hands.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:43:12.984 --> 00:43:16.984
- You torture yourself
- [INTERPRETER]

00:43:16.984 --> 00:43:21.302
while the person, who has harmed you, 
is first class.

00:43:21.302 --> 00:43:25.232
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:25.232 --> 00:43:36.042
- So, it's a myth not to forgive.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:43:36.042 --> 00:43:43.702
But you don't think about the people whom
you have to forgive; Just forgive in general.

00:43:43.702 --> 00:43:49.862
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:49.862 --> 00:43:53.562
- Some people say it is difficult
- [INTERPRETER]

00:43:53.562 --> 00:43:58.602
but it's a myth. What is difficult? Just
to say, "I forgive everyone," finished.

00:43:58.602 --> 00:44:03.098
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:03.098 --> 00:44:06.218
You don't have to take out 
something from your heart

00:44:06.218 --> 00:44:09.378
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:09.378 --> 00:44:12.448
- You just have to say
- [INTERPRETER]

00:44:14.419 --> 00:44:18.419
- These are the three conditions.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:44:18.901 --> 00:44:25.511
- First is of complete confidence in yourself
- [INTERPRETER]

00:44:25.511 --> 00:44:30.461
- second one is not to feel guilty
- [INTERPRETER]

00:44:30.461 --> 00:44:34.271
and the third one is to forgive
everyone, in general.

00:44:34.271 --> 00:44:39.021
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:39.021 --> 00:44:43.921
Now, first we'll tell you how we will
be nourishing our centers.

00:44:43.921 --> 00:44:49.541
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:49.541 --> 00:44:55.261
As it is, there are, as you know, they 
must have told you that the left and right

00:44:55.261 --> 00:45:01.151
- are two sides.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:45:01.151 --> 00:45:07.881
Left side is for the power of desire,
the right side for the power of action.

00:45:07.899 --> 00:45:16.289
[INTERPRETER]

00:45:16.289 --> 00:45:24.489
So now please put your left hand towards
Me. You have to take out your shoes first.

00:45:24.489 --> 00:45:29.539
- [INTERPRETER]
- because the Mother Earth helps us a lot.

00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:34.990
[INTERPRETER]

00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:45.840
[UNCLEAR] For those who are sitting on
the ground, it's all right but those

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:51.100
who are sitting on the chair, they have to
put their left leg on one side - right

00:45:51.100 --> 00:46:00.980
- with a little distance between the two.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:46:02.391 --> 00:46:06.391
Now please, put your left hand towards
Me, on your lap.

00:46:07.087 --> 00:46:10.147
[INTERPRETER]

00:46:10.377 --> 00:46:14.377
- Be comfortable, first of all.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:46:15.075 --> 00:46:19.075
- You shouldn't give a strain
- [INTERPRETER]

00:46:19.075 --> 00:46:23.075
- nor you should not bend also
- [INTERPRETER]

00:46:23.239 --> 00:46:26.859
Don't have to go to Himalayas, stand
on your heads - nothing.

00:46:26.859 --> 00:46:31.800
[INTERPRETER]

00:46:32.492 --> 00:46:39.192
- Now, please put your left hand towards Me
- [INTERPRETER]

00:46:40.886 --> 00:46:46.546
This is symbolic that you want to
have your Self-realization - desire.

00:46:46.546 --> 00:46:54.816
[INTERPRETER]

00:46:56.825 --> 00:47:04.705
Then, you have to use the right hand
for nourishing your centers.

00:47:04.705 --> 00:47:10.475
[INTERPRETER]

00:47:11.872 --> 00:47:18.042
- So, first you put your right hand on your heart
- [INTERPRETER]

00:47:19.271 --> 00:47:27.051
- In the heart resides the Spirit
- [INTERPRETER]

00:47:28.047 --> 00:47:33.807
Now, if you become the spirit, you 
become your own guide, your own master.

00:47:33.807 --> 00:47:39.677
[INTERPRETER]

00:47:39.677 --> 00:47:46.397
So, please take your right hand in the upper
portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

00:47:46.397 --> 00:47:54.697
- which is the center of your mastery.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:47:55.446 --> 00:48:00.576
This mastery comes to you through 
pure, Divine knowledge.

00:48:01.312 --> 00:48:06.632
[INTERPRETER]

00:48:06.632 --> 00:48:11.492
- But I cannot force it on you
- [INTERPRETER]

00:48:12.515 --> 00:48:17.165
The center for that is the lower portion
of your abdomen on the left hand side.

00:48:17.165 --> 00:48:21.715
[INTERPRETER]

00:48:25.626 --> 00:48:33.456
Now, raise your right hand again on
your abdomen on the left hand side

00:48:33.456 --> 00:48:38.546
[INTERPRETER]

00:48:38.546 --> 00:48:44.876
- We're working only on the left hand side
- [INTERPRETER]

00:48:44.876 --> 00:48:49.776
- Now we raise our right hand on our heart
- [INTERPRETER]

00:48:49.776 --> 00:48:57.646
Then we put our right hand on the corner
of our neck and turn our head to the right

00:48:57.646 --> 00:49:02.066
[INTERPRETER]

00:49:02.425 --> 00:49:07.475
I've already told you, that by feeling 
guilty this center goes out of order.

00:49:07.499 --> 00:49:13.649
[INTERPRETER]

00:49:14.407 --> 00:49:21.507
Then you take your right hand on your forehead
across and bend your head as far as possible.

00:49:21.507 --> 00:49:28.147
[INTERPRETER]

00:49:28.343 --> 00:49:40.323
Here you have to ask, you have to
forgive everyone in general.

00:49:40.323 --> 00:49:43.603
[INTERPRETER]

00:49:46.686 --> 00:49:54.006
Now, for your own satisfaction, without 
feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

00:49:54.006 --> 00:49:58.530
you have to ask forgiveness
from the Divine power.

00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:06.770
[INTERPRETER]

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:13.469
So, please put your hand on the back side for
that - the center is here [UNCLEAR]

00:50:13.469 --> 00:50:18.979
- [INTERPRETER]
- Just wait

00:50:18.979 --> 00:50:23.269
The center is here for asking forgiveness,
so bend your head back

00:50:23.954 --> 00:50:29.414
[INTERPRETER]

00:50:29.493 --> 00:50:37.773
- Now, stretch your palm -
- [INTERPRETER]

00:50:37.784 --> 00:50:41.574
- this is for the last center
- [INTERPRETER]

00:50:41.654 --> 00:50:47.284
Put the center of your palm on top
of the fontanel bone area

00:50:47.284 --> 00:50:50.144
[INTERPRETER]

00:50:50.144 --> 00:50:54.724
- which was a soft bone in your childhood
- [INTERPRETER]

00:50:55.742 --> 00:51:02.342
- Now, please bend your head as far as possible
- [INTERPRETER]

00:51:02.342 --> 00:51:09.182
Now, is important is to press back your fingers,
so there is good pressure on your scalp.

00:51:09.182 --> 00:51:15.172
[INTERPRETER]

00:51:15.172 --> 00:51:19.652
Bend your heads, bend your heads,
push back your fingers, push back

00:51:19.652 --> 00:51:24.682
- [INTERPRETER]
- Push back your fingers, push back.

00:51:24.802 --> 00:51:27.672
[INTERPRETER]

00:51:28.114 --> 00:51:34.314
- Now, move your scalp slowly
- [INTERPRETER]

00:51:34.857 --> 00:51:41.037
Please move your scalp slowly, 
seven times, clockwise

00:51:41.037 --> 00:51:44.527
- [INTERPRETER]

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:49.720
- Slowly
- [INTERPRETER]

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:52.800
- pressurize it
- [INTERPRETER]

00:51:53.275 --> 00:51:56.555
- That's all you have to do
- [INTERPRETER]

00:51:56.663 --> 00:52:00.813
- These people are standing in the doorway
- [INTERPRETER]

00:52:00.833 --> 00:52:04.757
- they can come in, if they want.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:52:07.367 --> 00:52:15.707
- What are they saying?
- [INTERPRETER]

00:52:15.707 --> 00:52:21.287
Close the door, They're just close to the
door - I mean, funny people.

00:52:33.010 --> 00:52:42.330
Alright. Now, please take out your 
spectacles and you have to close your eyes

00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:47.030
when I tell you. Please don't 
open them till I tell you.

00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:52.230
[INTERPRETER]

00:52:53.727 --> 00:52:57.437
You don't have to say any mantra,
any prayer - nothing

00:52:57.437 --> 00:53:01.127
[INTERPRETER]

00:53:01.127 --> 00:53:05.587
Don't put concentrate - nothing, just
leave it alone, your attention.

00:53:05.587 --> 00:53:18.077
[INTERPRETER]

00:53:18.077 --> 00:53:24.147
- Now, please close your eyes
- [INTERPRETER]

00:53:24.147 --> 00:53:28.147
- put both the feet apart
- [INTERPRETER]

00:53:28.147 --> 00:53:37.407
- and the left hand towards Me, on your lap
- [INTERPRETER]

00:53:37.407 --> 00:53:42.467
- and put the right hand on the heart.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:53:42.467 --> 00:53:46.037
- Close the eyes. Don't open them.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:53:47.432 --> 00:53:51.432
- Not very tight
- [INTERPRETER]

00:53:51.432 --> 00:53:54.732
- ordinary way.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:53:54.732 --> 00:54:00.592
Now here, you have to ask Me a very 
fundamental question about yourself.

00:54:00.592 --> 00:54:15.082
- You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:54:16.834 --> 00:54:23.314
Please ask three times, in your heart,
"Mother, am I the Spirit?"

00:54:24.077 --> 00:54:31.247
[INTERPRETER]

00:54:43.754 --> 00:54:50.544
Now I've told, you become the Spirit, you 
become your own guide, your own guru.

00:54:50.562 --> 00:54:56.652
[INTERPRETER]

00:54:56.942 --> 00:55:04.092
So now, please take your right hand in the upper
portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

00:55:04.092 --> 00:55:07.862
[INTERPRETER]

00:55:07.862 --> 00:55:15.092
and ask a fundamental question about 
yourself, "Mother, am I my own master?"

00:55:15.092 --> 00:55:24.032
- three times.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:55:29.043 --> 00:55:34.913
I've already told you that I respect your 
freedom and I cannot force your

00:55:34.913 --> 00:55:43.463
- Divine Knowledge upon you.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:55:43.463 --> 00:55:46.893
- You have to ask for it
- [INTERPRETER]

00:55:46.893 --> 00:55:50.573
So now, take your right hand in the lower
portion of your abdomen

00:55:50.573 --> 00:55:54.573
[INTERPRETER]

00:55:54.573 --> 00:56:04.833
and here you have to ask, "Mother, please
give me Your Divine Knowledge."

00:56:04.833 --> 00:56:10.403
Say it six times because this has, 
this center has six petals.

00:56:10.403 --> 00:56:22.653
[INTERPRETER]

00:56:33.152 --> 00:56:42.562
As soon as you ask for Divine knowledge,
the Kundalini starts moving upward.

00:56:42.562 --> 00:56:47.632
[INTERPRETER]

00:56:49.365 --> 00:56:52.785
- You may not feel anything
- [INTERPRETER]

00:56:53.416 --> 00:57:01.446
- but be happy; Nourish the higher centers
- [INTERPRETER]

00:57:01.446 --> 00:57:04.596
to allow the Kundalini to pass
through these centers.

00:57:04.596 --> 00:57:08.926
[INTERPRETER]

00:57:08.926 --> 00:57:15.626
So now, please try to raise your right 
hand the upper portion of your abdomen

00:57:15.628 --> 00:57:18.488
[INTERPRETER]

00:57:18.488 --> 00:57:27.788
With full self-confidence you have to say 
ten times, "Mother, I am my own master."

00:57:27.788 --> 00:57:38.508
[INTERPRETER]

00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:48.810
I've already told you the truth about you 
is that, you are not this body, this mind,

00:57:49.378 --> 00:57:56.508
these emotions, these conditionings and 
this ego but you are the Pure Spirit.

00:57:56.508 --> 00:58:07.128
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:08.957 --> 00:58:14.357
So now, please raise your right hand
on your heart

00:58:14.357 --> 00:58:18.237
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:18.635 --> 00:58:27.745
and here you have to say, with full confidence,
twelve times, "Mother, I am the Pure Spirit."

00:58:27.745 --> 00:58:33.845
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:48.581 --> 00:58:56.801
Now, the All-Pervading Power of Divine
Love, is the ocean of knowledge,

00:58:56.973 --> 00:59:00.973
[INTERPRETER]

00:59:00.973 --> 00:59:11.633
- is the ocean of bliss and joy
- [INTERPRETER]

00:59:11.668 --> 00:59:20.088
- but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness
- [INTERPRETER]

00:59:20.088 --> 00:59:24.848
- and whatever you may do
- [INTERPRETER]

00:59:24.848 --> 00:59:31.458
whatever mistakes you may commit, can be easily
dissolved by this ocean of forgiveness.

00:59:31.458 --> 00:59:36.718
[INTERPRETER]

00:59:38.563 --> 00:59:44.353
- So please, forgive yourself
- [INTERPRETER]

00:59:44.755 --> 00:59:50.215
Bring your hand like that, in the corner
of your neck and your shoulder

00:59:50.215 --> 00:59:57.815
- and put your head to your right
- [INTERPRETER]

00:59:57.815 --> 01:00:03.875
Here, you have to say, sixteen times,
"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

01:00:03.875 --> 01:00:15.945
[INTERPRETER]

01:00:25.905 --> 01:00:33.255
I've already told you, whether you forgive
or don't forgive, you do not do anything

01:00:33.708 --> 01:00:40.318
[INTERPRETER]
