00:00.937 --> 00:08.398
Today is a great day of Mahalakshmi Puja.

00:08.604 --> 00:12.758
Mahalakshmi is an incarnation

00:12.830 --> 00:18.629
of the Lakshmi, the power of Vishnu.

00:18.764 --> 00:23.201
She only incar­nated.

01:04.823 --> 01:07.242
This Mahalakshmi principle

01:07.273 --> 01:09.993
is born out of the Lakshmi,

01:10.096 --> 01:15.422
who is the power of Sri Vishnu.

01:27.321 --> 01:31.129
When in a human being

01:31.200 --> 01:39.164
the desire to rise higher comes in,

01:39.259 --> 01:46.356
the Lakshmi principle becomes the Mahalakshmi principle.

01:50.848 --> 01:53.023
Like in the West we can say,

01:53.031 --> 01:55.713
people have affluence of Lakshmi,

01:55.816 --> 02:00.535
so they wanted to rise above that principle

02:00.601 --> 02:06.305
and become Mahalakshmi.

02:13.279 --> 02:18.385
In the awareness it acts on the matter like aesthetics;

02:18.449 --> 02:21.538
people worry more about aesthetics

02:21.586 --> 02:27.139
than about possessions.

02:30.637 --> 02:33.933
And when they start growing

02:33.996 --> 02:37.865
higher and higher in their awareness of seeking,

02:37.948 --> 02:41.017
then they find that

02:41.049 --> 02:48.119
the attention should be such,

02:48.206 --> 02:52.068
that they should pay more im­portance

02:52.132 --> 02:54.624
to the aesthetics of things

02:54.688 --> 02:59.574
than to the gross values.

03:11.797 --> 03:15.062
Now when this desire becomes

03:15.177 --> 03:18.094
evident in human beings,

03:18.138 --> 03:24.937
then only Lakshmi incarnates as Mahalakshmi.

03:30.580 --> 03:34.655
So She incarnated as Mahalakshmi

03:34.802 --> 03:39.841
when Rama came on this earth, first time.

03:46.731 --> 03:50.943
And also She incarnated as Radha

03:51.004 --> 03:55.346
when Shri Krishna came on this earth.

03:58.266 --> 04:00.671
And when She came as Mary,

04:00.734 --> 04:03.146
it was Mahalakshmi

04:03.213 --> 04:09.004
who bore the child that is Lord Jesus Christ.

04:14.604 --> 04:19.500
So the child She bore

04:19.596 --> 04:26.290
was the great personality, of Mahavishnu.

04:33.490 --> 04:40.220
This Mahavishnu-tattwa is also represented,

04:40.259 --> 04:42.625
or we can say has an aspect,

04:42.665 --> 04:47.481
of others, which in­carnated on this earth

04:47.528 --> 04:52.735
as two children of Sita.

04:58.469 --> 05:05.104
They incarnated as

05:05.270 --> 05:12.012
Mahavira and Buddha, as Hassan and Hussein.

05:14.924 --> 05:20.588
Also at the time of the prophets

05:20.755 --> 05:24.633
Mahalakshmi incarnates as

05:24.687 --> 05:29.123
a pure relationship with them.

05:34.619 --> 05:37.817
Like Raja Janaka’s daughter was Janaki,

05:37.920 --> 05:41.917
means Sita;

05:42.020 --> 05:47.407
then She came on this earth

05:47.526 --> 05:50.435
as the daughter of Mohammed Sahib;

05:50.538 --> 05:53.967
and then She came on this earth as Nanaki,

05:53.983 --> 05:58.694
the sister of Nanaka.

06:11.243 --> 06:16.659
So She resides as a pure relationship

06:16.762 --> 06:21.077
of these gurus.

06:25.639 --> 06:31.214
Thus the Mahalakshmi’s greatness is that,

06:31.257 --> 06:34.295
through Her power only the Sushumna

06:34.335 --> 06:38.806
is cover­ed by Kundalini.

06:43.760 --> 06:48.935
She is the power of our evol­ution.

06:49.042 --> 06:51.603
And by Her power only

06:51.635 --> 06:54.295
we have risen to be human beings

06:54.321 --> 06:56.980
and by Her son’s power

06:57.029 --> 07:01.739
we are going to become higher people.

07:09.788 --> 07:13.042
Thus the impor­tance of Mahalakshmi is very great

07:13.082 --> 07:18.324
for all the Sahaja Yogis.

07:19.681 --> 07:22.216
Because She guides our Vishnu tattwa

07:22.248 --> 07:26.787
to its culmination, to its completion,

07:30.392 --> 07:36.749
which is the principle of our evolution.

07:36.872 --> 07:39.751
Thus She is a giver of Dharma,

07:39.828 --> 07:42.828
She gives us the Dharma and

07:42.854 --> 07:48.616
She is the giver of the truth.

07:50.538 --> 07:53.626
She is the one who relates us to our brain,

07:53.657 --> 07:59.565
the whole brain’s system is Mahalakshmi’s system.

08:02.243 --> 08:05.171
So it is She who exposes

08:05.195 --> 08:10.336
the whole of the knowledge as truth to us,

08:10.439 --> 08:15.107
on our central nervous system.

08:17.455 --> 08:20.851
But at the state of Virata,

08:20.899 --> 08:24.130
when Vishnu becomes the Virata,

08:24.170 --> 08:29.253
the great primordial being,

08:29.309 --> 08:35.981
then She is called as Viratangana, as his power.

08:44.167 --> 08:48.558
So these are the incarnations of Mahala­kshmi

08:48.604 --> 08:53.064
about which I have told.

08:59.649 --> 09:03.785
There’s so much can be said about this Mahalakshmi­tattwa;

09:03.944 --> 09:06.456
you are all blessed so much by that.

09:06.495 --> 09:09.210
And so today we remember

09:09.296 --> 09:13.745
Her great in­carnation as Maria,

09:13.832 --> 09:17.030
who was very great because

09:17.094 --> 09:20.998
She had to bear terrible pain in Her heart

09:21.046 --> 09:23.984
with all Her powers that She had,

09:24.055 --> 09:27.094
She was a tremendously powerful Lady.

09:27.133 --> 09:31.583
But despite that, She bore all the tortures

09:31.710 --> 09:37.114
of Christ upon Her heart.

09:37.154 --> 09:42.326
And it was Her order and Her desire

09:42.382 --> 09:46.362
that Christ had to crucify Himself

09:46.473 --> 09:51.693
so that people could be resurrected.

10:19.247 --> 10:22.118
And sometimes Indians ask Me

10:22.157 --> 10:25.346
what did She do to be a Mahalakshmi, what did She achieve?

10:25.378 --> 10:28.489
I said: “With all Her powers to bear it.

10:28.520 --> 10:34.695
To play the drama it must be too much.”

10:46.112 --> 10:53.240
So She is the redeemer and She connects you to God.

10:55.829 --> 10:59.791
In the sense She is the bridge.

10:59.863 --> 11:05.747
And the Kundalini rises over the bridge.

11:05.874 --> 11:11.418
And Kundalini is the Mahakali.

11:11.490 --> 11:13.767
Now we have a temple in India

11:13.839 --> 11:16.813
which you have visited of Mahalakshmi in Kolhapur;

11:16.861 --> 11:20.591
and there, when they sing,

11:20.663 --> 11:23.219
when they worship Mahalakshmi

11:23.259 --> 11:25.407
at that time they say “udho, udho,Ambe”.

11:25.447 --> 11:31.279
That time they say: “O Ambe, the Kundalini, you rise”.

11:40.782 --> 11:44.432
But Kundalini is the potential of all the three powers:

11:44.472 --> 11:47.907
Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati,

11:47.986 --> 11:54.524
because it is the primordial desire.

11:56.662 --> 11:59.663
Because She is the Holy Ghost, you see,

11:59.719 --> 12:03.614
so She contains all these three powers in it.

12:08.256 --> 12:10.996
Like Adi Shakti has all the three powers

12:11.028 --> 12:15.128
of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati.

12:18.030 --> 12:20.904
So now today is a great day for us

12:20.975 --> 12:23.740
because Mahalakshmi has helped us so much,

12:23.787 --> 12:25.992
Her blessings are much.

12:26.033 --> 12:28.638
She looks after all our well-­being,

12:28.718 --> 12:31.083
She is the one who looks after

12:31.115 --> 12:34.050
all our problems of redemption,

12:34.146 --> 12:37.338
She is the one who gives us all the possible

12:37.386 --> 12:40.196
help in our Chakras and correction of them.

12:40.220 --> 12:43.006
And She is the one who gives us

12:43.046 --> 12:47.386
all that is material or physical well­ being

12:47.465 --> 12:52.079
so we have to be very very thankful to Her today.

12:52.119 --> 12:54.817
You have to be grateful.

12:54.913 --> 12:57.338
And also today is Gregoire’s birthday.

12:57.362 --> 12:59.758
So I would like to congratulate him

12:59.822 --> 13:02.100
for making Me come to Munich

13:02.140 --> 13:04.551
because we had such a tremendous programme

13:04.607 --> 13:10.040
May God bless you all.
