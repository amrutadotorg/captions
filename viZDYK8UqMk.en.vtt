00:00:00.937 --> 00:00:08.398
Today is a great day of Mahalakshmi Puja.

00:00:08.604 --> 00:00:12.758
Mahalakshmi is an incarnation

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.629
of the Lakshmi, the power of Vishnu.

00:00:18.764 --> 00:00:23.201
She only incar­nated.

00:01:04.823 --> 00:01:07.242
This Mahalakshmi principle

00:01:07.273 --> 00:01:09.993
is born out of the Lakshmi,

00:01:10.096 --> 00:01:15.422
who is the power of Sri Vishnu.

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:31.129
When in a human being

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:39.164
the desire to rise higher comes in,

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:46.356
the Lakshmi principle becomes the Mahalakshmi principle.

00:01:50.848 --> 00:01:53.023
Like in the West we can say,

00:01:53.031 --> 00:01:55.713
people have affluence of Lakshmi,

00:01:55.816 --> 00:02:00.535
so they wanted to rise above that principle

00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:06.305
and become Mahalakshmi.

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:18.385
In the awareness it acts on the matter like aesthetics;

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:21.538
people worry more about aesthetics

00:02:21.586 --> 00:02:27.139
than about possessions.

00:02:30.637 --> 00:02:33.933
And when they start growing

00:02:33.996 --> 00:02:37.865
higher and higher in their awareness of seeking,

00:02:37.948 --> 00:02:41.017
then they find that

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:48.119
the attention should be such,

00:02:48.206 --> 00:02:52.068
that they should pay more im­portance

00:02:52.132 --> 00:02:54.624
to the aesthetics of things

00:02:54.688 --> 00:02:59.574
than to the gross values.

00:03:11.797 --> 00:03:15.062
Now when this desire becomes

00:03:15.177 --> 00:03:18.094
evident in human beings,

00:03:18.138 --> 00:03:24.937
then only Lakshmi incarnates as Mahalakshmi.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.655
So She incarnated as Mahalakshmi

00:03:34.802 --> 00:03:39.841
when Rama came on this earth, first time.

00:03:46.731 --> 00:03:50.943
And also She incarnated as Radha

00:03:51.004 --> 00:03:55.346
when Shri Krishna came on this earth.

00:03:58.266 --> 00:04:00.671
And when She came as Mary,

00:04:00.734 --> 00:04:03.146
it was Mahalakshmi

00:04:03.213 --> 00:04:09.004
who bore the child that is Lord Jesus Christ.

00:04:14.604 --> 00:04:19.500
So the child She bore

00:04:19.596 --> 00:04:26.290
was the great personality, of Mahavishnu.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:40.220
This Mahavishnu-tattwa is also represented,

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:42.625
or we can say has an aspect,

00:04:42.665 --> 00:04:47.481
of others, which in­carnated on this earth

00:04:47.528 --> 00:04:52.735
as two children of Sita.

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:05.104
They incarnated as

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:12.012
Mahavira and Buddha, as Hassan and Hussein.

00:05:14.924 --> 00:05:20.588
Also at the time of the prophets

00:05:20.755 --> 00:05:24.633
Mahalakshmi incarnates as

00:05:24.687 --> 00:05:29.123
a pure relationship with them.

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:37.817
Like Raja Janaka’s daughter was Janaki,

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.917
means Sita;

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.407
then She came on this earth

00:05:47.526 --> 00:05:50.435
as the daughter of Mohammed Sahib;

00:05:50.538 --> 00:05:53.967
and then She came on this earth as Nanaki,

00:05:53.983 --> 00:05:58.694
the sister of Nanaka.

00:06:11.243 --> 00:06:16.659
So She resides as a pure relationship

00:06:16.762 --> 00:06:21.077
of these gurus.

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:31.214
Thus the Mahalakshmi’s greatness is that,

00:06:31.257 --> 00:06:34.295
through Her power only the Sushumna

00:06:34.335 --> 00:06:38.806
is cover­ed by Kundalini.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.935
She is the power of our evol­ution.

00:06:49.042 --> 00:06:51.603
And by Her power only

00:06:51.635 --> 00:06:54.295
we have risen to be human beings

00:06:54.321 --> 00:06:56.980
and by Her son’s power

00:06:57.029 --> 00:07:01.739
we are going to become higher people.

00:07:09.788 --> 00:07:13.042
Thus the impor­tance of Mahalakshmi is very great

00:07:13.082 --> 00:07:18.324
for all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:07:19.681 --> 00:07:22.216
Because She guides our Vishnu tattwa

00:07:22.248 --> 00:07:26.787
to its culmination, to its completion,

00:07:30.392 --> 00:07:36.749
which is the principle of our evolution.

00:07:36.872 --> 00:07:39.751
Thus She is a giver of Dharma,

00:07:39.828 --> 00:07:42.828
She gives us the Dharma and

00:07:42.854 --> 00:07:48.616
She is the giver of the truth.

00:07:50.538 --> 00:07:53.626
She is the one who relates us to our brain,

00:07:53.657 --> 00:07:59.565
the whole brain’s system is Mahalakshmi’s system.

00:08:02.243 --> 00:08:05.171
So it is She who exposes

00:08:05.195 --> 00:08:10.336
the whole of the knowledge as truth to us,

00:08:10.439 --> 00:08:15.107
on our central nervous system.

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:20.851
But at the state of Virata,

00:08:20.899 --> 00:08:24.130
when Vishnu becomes the Virata,

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:29.253
the great primordial being,

00:08:29.309 --> 00:08:35.981
then She is called as Viratangana, as his power.

00:08:44.167 --> 00:08:48.558
So these are the incarnations of Mahala­kshmi

00:08:48.604 --> 00:08:53.064
about which I have told.

00:08:59.649 --> 00:09:03.785
There’s so much can be said about this Mahalakshmi­tattwa;

00:09:03.944 --> 00:09:06.456
you are all blessed so much by that.

00:09:06.495 --> 00:09:09.210
And so today we remember

00:09:09.296 --> 00:09:13.745
Her great in­carnation as Maria,

00:09:13.832 --> 00:09:17.030
who was very great because

00:09:17.094 --> 00:09:20.998
She had to bear terrible pain in Her heart

00:09:21.046 --> 00:09:23.984
with all Her powers that She had,

00:09:24.055 --> 00:09:27.094
She was a tremendously powerful Lady.

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:31.583
But despite that, She bore all the tortures

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:37.114
of Christ upon Her heart.

00:09:37.154 --> 00:09:42.326
And it was Her order and Her desire

00:09:42.382 --> 00:09:46.362
that Christ had to crucify Himself

00:09:46.473 --> 00:09:51.693
so that people could be resurrected.

00:10:19.247 --> 00:10:22.118
And sometimes Indians ask Me

00:10:22.157 --> 00:10:25.346
what did She do to be a Mahalakshmi, what did She achieve?

00:10:25.378 --> 00:10:28.489
I said: “With all Her powers to bear it.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:34.695
To play the drama it must be too much.”

00:10:46.112 --> 00:10:53.240
So She is the redeemer and She connects you to God.

00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:59.791
In the sense She is the bridge.

00:10:59.863 --> 00:11:05.747
And the Kundalini rises over the bridge.

00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:11.418
And Kundalini is the Mahakali.

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:13.767
Now we have a temple in India

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:16.813
which you have visited of Mahalakshmi in Kolhapur;

00:11:16.861 --> 00:11:20.591
and there, when they sing,

00:11:20.663 --> 00:11:23.219
when they worship Mahalakshmi

00:11:23.259 --> 00:11:25.407
at that time they say “udho, udho,Ambe”.

00:11:25.447 --> 00:11:31.279
That time they say: “O Ambe, the Kundalini, you rise”.

00:11:40.782 --> 00:11:44.432
But Kundalini is the potential of all the three powers:

00:11:44.472 --> 00:11:47.907
Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati,

00:11:47.986 --> 00:11:54.524
because it is the primordial desire.

00:11:56.662 --> 00:11:59.663
Because She is the Holy Ghost, you see,

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:03.614
so She contains all these three powers in it.

00:12:08.256 --> 00:12:10.996
Like Adi Shakti has all the three powers

00:12:11.028 --> 00:12:15.128
of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati.

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:20.904
So now today is a great day for us

00:12:20.975 --> 00:12:23.740
because Mahalakshmi has helped us so much,

00:12:23.787 --> 00:12:25.992
Her blessings are much.

00:12:26.033 --> 00:12:28.638
She looks after all our well-­being,

00:12:28.718 --> 00:12:31.083
She is the one who looks after

00:12:31.115 --> 00:12:34.050
all our problems of redemption,

00:12:34.146 --> 00:12:37.338
She is the one who gives us all the possible

00:12:37.386 --> 00:12:40.196
help in our Chakras and correction of them.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:43.006
And She is the one who gives us

00:12:43.046 --> 00:12:47.386
all that is material or physical well­ being

00:12:47.465 --> 00:12:52.079
so we have to be very very thankful to Her today.

00:12:52.119 --> 00:12:54.817
You have to be grateful.

00:12:54.913 --> 00:12:57.338
And also today is Gregoire’s birthday.

00:12:57.362 --> 00:12:59.758
So I would like to congratulate him

00:12:59.822 --> 00:13:02.100
for making Me come to Munich

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.551
because we had such a tremendous programme

00:13:04.607 --> 00:13:10.040
May God bless you all.
