1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:06,300
It is so joy giving to be back in Australia.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:14,190
When I wanted to come here in this month,

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:23,360
Stephen told me that Perth would be scorchingly
hot (Laughter) and, “I don’t think you

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,029
should go to Perth first, you can go later."

5
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:29,190
So I said, “That part you leave it to me!

6
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,329
The rest is alright!”

7
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:38,670
Now you have seen how it rained and rained
and rained, because you wanted rain.

8
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,320
That was needed very much.

9
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:48,159
And also you wanted a cooler atmosphere.

10
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:50,140
Both things have worked out.

11
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:57,399
But then the worry was that, because of the
rain, the seekers won’t come.

12
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:00,909
Also that was solved because it was a testing
ground.

13
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:04,559
I told them, “If they are real seekers they’ll
come."

14
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,780
Otherwise what’s the use of having a big
quantity with no seeking?

15
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,420
And see yesterday what beautiful people came!

16
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,890
They came all the way in the rain, because
they were seekers and very deep seekers.

17
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,299
They never even asked a question!

18
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:25,579
Can you imagine, in this Australia, I am always
bombarded with questions.

19
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:32,210
And they had told me not to allow them to
ask questions But I could feel their seeking

20
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,869
so much, that I said, “Better ask me questions."

21
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:38,649
And not a single question was asked.

22
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:42,540
So in one shot how many things are done?

23
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:51,049
You got the rain that you needed very much
for your trees, for your crops, for your fruits,

24
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:52,710
for everything.

25
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,750
And it was most unexpected.

26
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:03,159
And then you got it cooled down so that our
programmes could go on well.

27
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:07,770
Then you got the real seekers and the real
seeking.

28
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,100
But the electricity went off.

29
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:14,349
Now see the good point of electricity, also:
because electricity went off,

30
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:21,830
we had those candles and all the bhoots I
saw were just burnt with these candles on!

31
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,799
And I came in the room [and] they all went,

32
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:24,799
“Buk! buk!

33
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:28,440
Buk!” like that, and I could see why candles
had to be put!

34
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,689
So, also, that was a good thing that we should
rely sometimes on natural things.

35
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:37,920
We are so much dependant on electricity, is
not a very good thing.

36
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,030
So we should have always provision for something
natural.

37
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:47,080
We should keep some lanterns and things and
should try to live more with the nature than

38
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,390
with this electricity.

39
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:54,610
I tell you this electricity is responsible
for spoiling our eyes very much.

40
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:59,819
Supposing we had used those lights which [the]
older generation had used, we would never

41
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:06,569
have strained so much our eyes as we are with
this electricity.

42
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:11,319
Because not [only] that it gives us light
but also it takes away light from our eyes.

43
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:16,750
So too much use of electricity has made us
like slaves to it.

44
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,810
As you know that, in America, once the electricity
failed and so many people died.

45
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,030
So it’s more to depend on natural things.

46
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:30,930
And this is a good trend that you have, that
you try to have more natural surroundings,

47
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,920
more natural places to live in.

48
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:47,410
So the main thing we have to realise, is that
equilibrium that is being worked out by Paramachaitanya.

49
00:03:47,410 --> 00:04:01,750
If Paramchaitanya is the power of love of
God, then it works out equilibrium.

50
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:10,129
So the Sahaja Yogis who are going to work
out Paramchaitanya have to have equilibrium

51
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:14,420
in their life.

52
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:19,760
This is a place where I say resides Mahaganesha.

53
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:25,730
So we have to understand how Shri Ganesh brings
balance in us.

54
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:33,890
It’s very important to see that his swastika
represents nothing else but balance.

55
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,080
Balance when it is steady.

56
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:46,630
When it starts moving in the right direction,
then constructive work starts.

57
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:51,720
And also it works out all that is important
for life.

58
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,690
But when it starts the other way round it
works out the destructive part.

59
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,630
These both are in balance.

60
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,290
If they are not life cannot go on.

61
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:07,060
The constructive and destructive both have
to be in balance.

62
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:17,570
If you see in the nature: for example, a bud
has to come, and when the bud dies then the

63
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,350
fruit comes out.

64
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:28,500
The tree has to evaporate its water to the
sky.

65
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,680
If it does not then it won’t rain.

66
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,220
It won’t trigger the rain.

67
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:40,250
But during winter season it has to drop out
its leaves, because these leaves have to die

68
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:46,340
and fall on to the ground to nourish the mother
nature with nitrogen.

69
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:52,630
Then, during summer time, again they come
back.

70
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:58,470
So the life goes on like this, that, whatever
is created is destroyed; something new comes

71
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:08,100
up; again that new thing also comes up in
a way that it becomes constructive.

72
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,740
And then whatever it has constructed, part
of it is destroyed.

73
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,770
So actually, if you see – in the death resides
the life.

74
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:21,750
If there is no death – imagine if all the
people who were born since long, would have

75
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,320
been living today – we would not have been
here.

76
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,280
It would have been so difficult to manage
ourselves with all these people.

77
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:36,910
But so many animals have died and those animals
also have become human beings.

78
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:44,060
So many human beings have to die to get other
people to come on this Earth.

79
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,910
And that you have to take some rest and come
back again.

80
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,820
So the death is just a change of life.

81
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,020
Without death, life cannot exist.

82
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,260
It’s a balance between the two.

83
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,630
So a Sahaja Yogi should never be afraid of
death.

84
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,330
He should never be afraid of death.

85
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:08,400
Because if he is going to die it is only going
to be another life where he rests for a while

86
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,880
and comes back with greater enthusiasm, with
greater energy.

87
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,270
So there is a complete balance in nature,
if you see.

88
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,060
If there was no balance we could not have
existed.

89
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,500
Supposing the Earth was moving with a greater
speed, you would not have existed.

90
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:30,470
If the Pacific Ocean was deeper, even by certain
feet, you would not have existed.

91
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:35,490
So many things are completely in balance:
the distance with the sun, the distance with

92
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,680
the moon.

93
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,710
Everything is so much in balance.

94
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:42,930
If this balance breaks then we would be nowhere.

95
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:52,490
So we have to understand that all this is
done by Shri Ganesha.

96
00:07:52,490 --> 00:08:03,190
He is the one who looks after all the material
things and all the things that are created.

97
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:11,550
For example, the first chakra is created by
this Mother Earth and all this universe then,

98
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,980
is created by the second chakra.

99
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:24,170
But the first chakra is the one which emits
the holiness, the auspiciousness, which gives

100
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,170
balance.

101
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:29,640
Auspiciousness comes only through balance.

102
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:36,099
So I find people when they have lost their
balances, they go to the Right or to the Left.

103
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:42,050
People are very righteous, extremely righteous,
very good Sahaja Yogis, nice, but there is

104
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,050
no love.

105
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:46,399
Without love, righteousness has no meaning.

106
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,610
Love doesn’t mean that you indulge into
anything, but you must have detached love

107
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,199
and responsibility.

108
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,450
So in our life we should see if we have that
balance or not.

109
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:00,410
It’s very important if we have to see to
Shri Ganesh.

110
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:09,129
Shri Ganesha, as you know, is on Mooladhara,
he controls all our senses as far as the Mooladhara

111
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:13,259
is concerned, especially all the excretion.

112
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:19,210
So we are not people who believe in the indulgence
of it, neither we believe in the detachment

113
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,790
of it; but in the balance.

114
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:26,680
That’s why you all have to be married, you
have to have a proper physical life and that

115
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:33,529
you should have proper children and lead a
very sensible, dignified married life.

116
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:35,139
That is very important.

117
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:36,410
But love should be there.

118
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:44,180
There should be love between husband and wife,
between children and parents and everyone.

119
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:49,110
If one person goes into imbalance the whole
family goes into imbalance.

120
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:54,470
To establish a family, sweetly and nicely,
is also an art.

121
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:59,910
And if both of them agree and say that, “We
will do this way!”

122
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,290
I am sure it’s not difficult.

123
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:07,579
Because you are Sahaja Yogis [so] you already
know the quality of balancing.

124
00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:15,300
What I find in the West, now, is the balance
has gone really on the rocks.

125
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:22,100
Because, see now, there are all kinds of problems
of homosexuality and this and that and all

126
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,100
that.

127
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,470
This is just because of imbalances [that]
people have gone to that limit.

128
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:33,910
Another is asceticism, where your people are
ascetic, made ascetic like in TM and all that.

129
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,209
They have taken to these things.

130
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:37,820
Because these are unnatural things.

131
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,399
Natural is to be in balance.

132
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:48,480
If you are not in balance then things go off
and you become either too much of something

133
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,310
and nothing of the other.

134
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,230
That’s how people suffer.

135
00:10:53,230 --> 00:11:01,230
So from Ganesha’s chakra we have to learn
what are we doing.

136
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:08,860
So sometimes we have to accumulate things,
we have to consume things, and then we have

137
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,680
to throw them away also.

138
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,920
It is not that what ever we consume is just
stored up within us or in the house.

139
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,629
So we must also learn how to throw away things
and how to take inside.

140
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:26,080
This is in our household [and] in our thought
also.

141
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:33,129
In our thought also, when we receive some
thoughts from anywhere, we should only digest

142
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:34,690
that [which] is good for us.

143
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,420
And it’s digested because of Paramachaitanya.

144
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:41,519
The rest should be thrown away, you shouldn’t
bother [with it].

145
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,009
Like yesterday somebody met me.

146
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:48,100
She said, “Mother I am a Catholic and I
cannot get out of Catholicism."

147
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,550
She is supposed to be, she wants to do, Sahaja
Yoga.

148
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,200
Then I said, “You stay inside Catholicism."

149
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,889
Because there is no question of balance.

150
00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:05,180
But in Sahaja Yoga whatever good of Catholicism,
means that you have to worship Christ – that

151
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,279
part is alright.

152
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:09,860
The rest, whatever is nonsensical has to be
thrown away.

153
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:20,020
So the whole atmosphere that you face, of
thoughts, of ideas, of books, whatever you

154
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:25,199
read, you must develop a capacity to consume
that [which] is good for you, and whatever

155
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:27,149
is bad you should throw away.

156
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:31,939
I must say in Austria people are really doing
that very well.

157
00:12:31,939 --> 00:12:34,220
Somebody is now doing research on Koran.

158
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:40,550
He is taking out all the essences of Koran
which are in balance.

159
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:45,870
Koran talks of balance: talks of that you
must have balance – equilibrium.

160
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,990
It talks of it, and so he has taken that point.

161
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:58,499
And now he is taking out all that creates
imbalances in the Islamic book called ‘Koran’,

162
00:12:58,499 --> 00:13:00,709
which people have used for imbalances.

163
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:06,589
On one point you can show how they have gone,
deviated, from their path.

164
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:09,620
‘Deviated’ means – they have gone into
imbalances.

165
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:14,760
For example Christianity now: you can take
it very clearly that they didn’t use Ganesha’s

166
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,519
principle there at all.

167
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:39,100
But all throughout it’s written that you
have to look after yourself in a moral way.

168
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,700
Now in the Old Testament it is written: ‘Thou
shalt not commit adultery’.

169
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:48,279
But Christ has made it even subtler – very
subtle – because He’s at Agnya controlling

170
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,279
the eyes.

171
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,189
So he said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous
eyes."

172
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:59,439
But the Christians have crossed all the limits
of adultery, all the limits.

173
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:04,519
I mean, I don’t know to what limit they
are going to go now, I mean really they have

174
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:13,730
gone amuck, the way they are going into this
kind of experimentation.

175
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,389
And then what will happen to your children?

176
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:18,360
What will happen to your society?

177
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,779
That’s what is happening now, in complete
imbalance.

178
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:33,480
Completely in imbalance, all these societies,
where they are using adultery as a style of

179
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,519
life.

180
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:41,850
What Christ has said, just the opposite they
are doing.

181
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:47,130
Same as Shri Krishna has said that in everybody
resides the Spirit.

182
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,610
Then everybody is just the same.

183
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,339
So how can you have caste system?

184
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:55,740
You can have at the most caste system according
to the work that you are doing.

185
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:01,779
But you can’t have caste system according
to the birth.

186
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:02,779
You cannot have.

187
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:04,999
I mean it’s so plain, clean.

188
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:11,839
You can see it so clearly, He has said it,
that everybody has got the Spirit.

189
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,980
So everybody can ascend.

190
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,920
Christ has said the same thing.

191
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,709
He has not said that women don’t have the
Spirit or men have the Spirit.

192
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:24,499
And look at the way that these people are
talking that they cannot have ordination.

193
00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:30,600
Of course ordination itself is humbug, but
still.

194
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,610
But to deprive someone of certain rights because
they are women or men is something absolutely,

195
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,970
I should say, nonsense.

196
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:44,839
It has no relevance to dharma, because ‘dharma’
means balance.

197
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:46,160
‘Dharma’ means balance.

198
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:52,290
The one who has balance is the man who is
dharmic, who is in the centre.

199
00:15:52,290 --> 00:16:01,870
If you are in the centre, say you take, say
a balance, this called as balancing.

200
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,660
But in Hindi it’s called as taraju (तराजू).

201
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,889
Now you hold it in the hand.

202
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:07,139
It’s called as balance, can you imagine?

203
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:08,709
You hold it in the centre.

204
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:13,129
The centre of gravity of that balance is in
the centre.

205
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:17,999
Now if you go more on this side this will
go down, or you go on this side it will go

206
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:18,999
down.

207
00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:25,450
But if you are at the gravity point you cannot
move this side or that side.

208
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:29,760
Can you imagine the gravity is coming from
Mother Earth!

209
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,480
And Mother Earth has made Shri Ganesha.

210
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:41,089
So this gravity point within us is to be maintained
and this gravity comes very natural to human

211
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:42,089
beings.

212
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:43,480
It’s not to be adopted or anything.

213
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:50,709
If [in] childhood, if children are told about
their gravity, about their dignity, about

214
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:59,189
their greatness, they will immediately develop
it with a great pride that, “We are something

215
00:16:59,189 --> 00:17:04,010
special and that we have to have this gravity
within us."

216
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:09,690
Now this gravity gives you a kind of an attraction.

217
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:15,560
Anybody who is grave, doesn’t mean that
you pull a big face, it never means that.

218
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:22,750
But gravity means that you are not disturbed
easily by any turmoil or anything.

219
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:28,220
Gravity means so many things as you can see,
from Shri Ganesha’s character.

220
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:33,390
Gravity means you are the one who is standing
in the centre.

221
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:43,640
A person who sees everything and doesn’t
get disturbed, doesn’t get tempted, is self-contented,

222
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:55,530
doesn’t ask for anything, doesn’t need
anything, doesn’t take revenge, forgives.

223
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,901
Because he has no way to get out of his gravity.

224
00:17:58,901 --> 00:18:00,690
He is just bound there.

225
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:05,640
Now somebody takes a revenge and runs away:
“Alright, go away!”

226
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,260
If somebody tries to trouble him: “Alright,
go away!”

227
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,220
Because he can’t run out of that gravity
point.

228
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,950
That other person has lost his balance but
he can’t run after that person who is in

229
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:16,950
imbalance.

230
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,450
So he doesn’t run after that person who
has done wrong.

231
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,160
He says, “Alright, he has done wrong?

232
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,610
Have pity on him let him do that."

233
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,200
He doesn’t run after that person.

234
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,590
He is standing there.

235
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:34,690
And his standing there itself is sufficient
to frighten others, and to destroy others.

236
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:38,550
Because he’s standing at a point where he
cannot be destroyed.

237
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,140
But the others are running towards destruction.

238
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:46,030
So what’s the use of running after him,
getting yourself also destroyed?

239
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:54,960
Such a person who has achieved that balance
sees others as something to be pitied, because

240
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,780
he sees they are on the verge of falling down.

241
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:03,380
I am here nicely settled down, but they are
on the verge of falling down.

242
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:07,960
They may try to tell him, they may try to
help him.

243
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,020
They may try to do everything for that person,
because they can see that person is going

244
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,020
to fall down.

245
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:18,930
But if that person doesn’t want to take
to balance you cannot force it.

246
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:23,580
So the Ganesha’s greatest quality is that
he has gravity.

247
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,740
With that gravity he sits down on this Mother
Earth.

248
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:38,060
Now, because this is a country of Ganesha,
the Australians must have balance, should,

249
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,060
naturally have.

250
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,060
But they don’t.

251
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,060
I must tell you, they don’t.

252
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:46,530
And my experience of Australians before I
started Sahaja Yoga has been terrific, I must

253
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,340
tell you that (laughing)!

254
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:58,590
If an Australian starts drinking, only person
who can compete with him is a Russian!

255
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,440
And then they talk so irrelevantly, you don’t
know how to deal with them.

256
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:10,150
If they shake your hand, then you will feel,
after some time, you have lost it.

257
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:16,300
Everything they do in such a big way that
I couldn’t understand why is it [that] they

258
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,260
shake your hand so badly.

259
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,670
So C.P. said, “You see they have lots of
jungles."

260
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:28,210
He tried to console me, “and there are lots
of animals and things and that’s why you

261
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,690
see they shake hands like that."

262
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:33,100
I said, “No animal shakes hands you see!”

263
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,430
How have they learned from the animals?

264
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,800
I can’t get this explanation alright!

265
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,380
On the contrary they are extremely gentle.

266
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:44,340
Animals are extremely gentle with each other.

267
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:48,010
So how this kind of shaking hands has started?

268
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:52,930
And only people who can beat them are Greeks
who shake hands in a very funny way that really

269
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,810
you get a big jerk!

270
00:20:54,810 --> 00:21:08,410
So I felt that the country of Ganesha, should
be absolutely in balance and in one tune with

271
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:11,990
this Paramachaitanya.

272
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:15,360
You see the animals who live in the jungles.

273
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,560
You have so much of nature.

274
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:23,760
See these trees – they grow up to a point
and they do not aggress others, they do not

275
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,460
fight, they do not have groups.

276
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,460
Nothing of the kind.

277
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:34,750
Just they grow, accept whatever is given to
them, live with it happily, and if they have

278
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:40,400
to be destroyed they accept the destruction.

279
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:46,870
But they are absolutely in contact with God,
or under the complete control of God almighty.

280
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:52,050
That’s why animals are called as ‘pashu’,
means pash, means ‘under the control of

281
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,050
God’.

282
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,740
While we have got freedom.

283
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,780
Even we have got freedom.

284
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,060
Still this is the country of Shri Ganesha.

285
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:06,550
[What] the nature should really imbibe within
you, is the balance.

286
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:13,920
And the balance should come in such a manner
that your whole character, your own temperament

287
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,610
should show that balance within you.

288
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:25,010
But what I find is the most difficult thing
in Australia that there are groups and people

289
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:30,200
fight and lots of problems with that.

290
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:38,480
It surprises me – how can [it be], in the
country of Ganesha, where there are ganas?

291
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,360
All Ganas are here.

292
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:44,530
If ganas start fighting with each other what
will happen?

293
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:49,460
Supposing the anti-bodies in our body start
fighting with each other then what will happen

294
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,270
to our body?

295
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,570
So you are like ganas!

296
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:57,700
You are specially blessed people to be born
in this special country.

297
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:04,820
And, after all these achievements that you
have made, if you are going to take these

298
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:12,220
absolutely nonsensical things of the countries
which are over developed, have lost their

299
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:18,110
balance, then what’s the use of being born
in this Ganesha’s land?

300
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:23,160
In this Ganesha’s land you have to have
a complete balance within yourself.

301
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:30,030
That’s what I expect from the Sahaja Yogis
of Australia: that they have to give to the

302
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:35,010
whole world the sense of balance of Shri Ganesha.

303
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:43,620
On the contrary it is being reported to me
that, every time we have our programme in

304
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:59,000
Ganapatipule, people have noticed that there
are groups in Australia, that people are not

305
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,930
clean hearted; they talk ill of others.

306
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:11,120
And they told me, warned me, “Mother be
on the look out, why it is happening.

307
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,650
They speak something behind their backs and
try to convince the people of other countries

308
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:17,770
about it."

309
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:20,970
Of course they being so clean that they don’t
like it.

310
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,820
They don’t want to hear it from Sahaja Yogis.

311
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:28,640
They don’t want to hear against anyone who
are Sahaja Yogis.

312
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,750
So they informed me, “Mother this is a very
serious thing!”

313
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:35,500
And certain things [that] they have told me
are really very serious.

314
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:40,930
So now we have to first decide that we should
bear no grudge to anyone.

315
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:44,170
How can you bear a grudge to anyone?

316
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,510
We have to be forgiving.

317
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,750
All the time forgiving.

318
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:51,430
Something, somebody has said it, alright,
doesn’t matter.

319
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:55,361
As it is, English language, you know, is not
a very soft language, it’s not a very soft

320
00:24:55,361 --> 00:25:00,630
language, and in that if you say something
one should not mind.

321
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:04,950
It’s a very humorous language but the humour
sometimes cuts you out.

322
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,480
But it doesn’t matter.

323
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,700
That’s the defect of the language.

324
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:17,590
But that doesn’t mean that you should say
harsh words to anyone, or you should be indifferent

325
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,590
to anyone.

326
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:22,230
Do your duties to your children, to your wife,
to your husband.

327
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:25,210
Indifference to anyone, itself, is tremendous
harshness.

328
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:30,270
For the small thing if a woman gets angry
and doesn’t talk to her husband, or if the

329
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:35,360
husband neglects the wife, and doesn’t bother
about her, looking after her, caring for her,

330
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,430
then it’s a crime.

331
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:41,200
According to Sahaja Yoga it’s a wrong thing
to do.

332
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,840
Because you must have balance you must have
softness of nature.

333
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:51,160
You should talk very softly to others and
be kind and nice.

334
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,240
Just find out if you are doing that or not.

335
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,100
Then between the group [also].

336
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:01,680
It’s a question of using the power of love.

337
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:07,140
We have no other power: we have no money power,
we have no this political power, economic

338
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,140
power, nothing.

339
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,760
What power we have got is the power of love.

340
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:18,390
For that, when you talk to each other, one
has to talk in a soft manner; extremely soft

341
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,430
and kind manner.

342
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:28,540
You’ll be surprised: I must say, in my experience,
I have found Germans like that!

343
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,550
Extremely soft to each other, extremely gentle!

344
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:37,990
I mean I can’t believe these Germans who
killed the whole world once upon a time!

345
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:43,250
Now in Sahaja Yoga suddenly they have realise,
“What a horrible thing we have done!”

346
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:48,070
And Sahaja Yogis, they are extremely gentle.

347
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:58,190
You scratch anyone and you will be surprised
that the, all of them, all the Sahaja Yogis

348
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,980
are extremely, extremely gentle.

349
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:09,820
While the Italians I used to think would be
very gentle, because they have art, culture,

350
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,710
everything and they produce such nice things.

351
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:16,310
But on the contrary I find that Germans can
beat them.

352
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:19,610
It’s beautiful German Sahaja Yogis there
have.

353
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:20,870
They hate neo-fascism.

354
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:24,700
They said, “We have had enough of it!

355
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,960
We had such a bad name all over the world!

356
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,210
If they know we are Germans nobody wants to
look at us!”

357
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,790
And what are these people doing?

358
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:36,760
So they have become extremely gentle, from
one end to another end.

359
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:44,220
And this gentleness really brings them out,
because everybody is so surprised that Germans

360
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,010
could be that gentle, so sweet.

361
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:53,930
Now look at Shri Ganesh – how gentle he
is, how sweet he is and how innocent he is.

362
00:27:53,930 --> 00:28:03,080
His ways are so gentle: how he works on you,
how he makes things for you, how gently he

363
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,880
does all these things.

364
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,360
Like see now you cannot see this flower opening.

365
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,380
In my room you put some flowers and they started
growing.

366
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,660
You can’t see the growth.

367
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:17,390
If you put a camera of a special nature which
can record, you can see it growing there,

368
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:18,750
but you can’t see [normally].

369
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,460
You can’t see a tree growing.

370
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,940
You can’t see a flower opening out.

371
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:33,100
You just can’t see anything that is growing
by nature, by Shri Ganesh.

372
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,860
He does it so gently.

373
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:39,020
Now also he will not grow trees one on top
of another!

374
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:42,660
But in such a way that they all get the suns
rays.

375
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:48,430
Just like a great mother, I must say, the
way, gently, he does everything.

376
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:52,460
Every leaf is made differently – what an
art!

377
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,460
Every leaf!

378
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:58,400
In the whole world you cannot find exactly
the same leaf whether it is from Australia

379
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,940
or from America.

380
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,910
The leaf, if you see it under a microscope,
will differ.

381
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,260
Every leaf!

382
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,270
Can you imagine?

383
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:13,800
Look at his work, how gently he puts everything,
how gently he works.

384
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:23,510
And while we are living on the grounds of
Shri Ganesha how gentle we should be.

385
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:28,070
And in dealing with people we should be extremely,
extremely gentle.

386
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:33,450
We should show that we are Ganesha’s special
ganas.

387
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:37,360
That’s what I feel about Australians.

388
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,510
We have had some mishaps, I know, doesn’t
matter.

389
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,510
But that’s alright.

390
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,260
A few of them were like that.

391
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:53,450
But all of you should really learn to be very
loving, gentle, kind and concerned.

392
00:29:53,450 --> 00:30:01,940
Small, small things can make people happy,
very happy.

393
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:06,070
And I try all these tricks myself and you
should also try these tricks.

394
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,380
It’s very simple.

395
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:15,450
One day I gave a sari to a lady, so she said,
“Mother how do you know I love this colour?”

396
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,970
“Because I have seen you mostly wearing
this colour.

397
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,420
So I know you love this colour."

398
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,570
“But did you see me?”

399
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,710
“Yes, of course, I saw you."

400
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:29,470
So these small things: she was so heartened;
she felt that, “Mother notices me,” Because

401
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,530
I have seen you.

402
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,440
I mean I see all of you.

403
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,180
But I know about all of you because I am concerned
and bothered about you.

404
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:43,780
And everyone I know where you stand, what’s
wrong with you, what should be done, what

405
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,900
you like, what you don’t like.

406
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,660
There’s no harm in doing that.

407
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:52,930
It’s much better to have a better rapport
when you understand what’s the problem is.

408
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,840
I immediately know what’s the problem.

409
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:00,310
I know a person who is dominating, I know
a person who is mistrusting.

410
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,310
Everything I know.

411
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:10,110
And gradually I try to tell them in a very
gentle way that, “This should be corrected."

412
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,540
But you need not tell them.

413
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:16,190
For you there’s a very simple method of
giving bandhans and improving people.

414
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:22,210
You don’t have to worry about doing something
very drastic about it or to tell them on the

415
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,210
face.

416
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:27,690
Only thing if you give bandhan to them you
can do it.

417
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:38,000
Now, about this, how to develop this balance,
is the big problem and I was thinking that

418
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,220
I will talk about this later on to people
in details: how to develop the balance in

419
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,220
our character, in our nature.

420
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,520
Of course meditation does help you to be in
the centre.

421
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,050
But, still, sometimes we just slip off.

422
00:31:54,050 --> 00:32:01,280
And there is a way by which you can really
make your character in such a way that you’ll

423
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,970
remain in balance all the time.

424
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:10,460
On the contrary when there will be a crisis
you will just jump on to your gravity point.

425
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,610
That should happen.

426
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:12,910
If that happens no problem.

427
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:13,990
It happens with me.

428
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:21,050
If I see any crisis anywhere, in Sahaja Yoga,
in my family life, or anywhere, immediately

429
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:24,340
I know that I am deep down on to my gravity.

430
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:30,140
And from there I can see everything so clearly
and then I solve the problem.

431
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:34,810
That is what one has to understand, that you
have to jump on your gravity.

432
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:37,540
And then it’s not a relative position.

433
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:41,530
To be on the gravity is not a relative position.

434
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:47,760
It is not that you have to compare yourself
with others.

435
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,650
No you don’t have to.

436
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:55,090
You don’t have to think that I’ll be losing
this or I’ll be gaining this.

437
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,090
Nothing of the kind.

438
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:58,200
You are there on your own position.

439
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,600
You are there.

440
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,390
You are in charge of yourself.

441
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,740
So you don’t worry.

442
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:10,720
There is no jealousy, there’s no fear, there’s
no kind of a temptation, just you are there.

443
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,960
You are not bothered.

444
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:18,850
Sometimes I have seen the leaders are worried
about their leadership sometimes.

445
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:27,980
Now leadership is just hocus-pocus, I must
tell you.

446
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,410
If somebody says Mother you become the leader
I’ll say, “No.

447
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:33,670
I know.

448
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:34,950
I know that joke!”

449
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,370
So it’s a joke.

450
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,710
Leadership is a joke you see.

451
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:44,780
And if you know it’s a joke, then only you
will work it out better.

452
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:48,550
Because, there’s nothing like hierarchy
in Sahaja Yoga.

453
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,950
As you know, we are all one, the same.

454
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:55,100
We cannot say that hands are better than feet
and the feet is better than this – nothing

455
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,130
of the kind.

456
00:33:56,130 --> 00:34:03,380
In the same way everything is very important,
and everything circulates like the blood cells.

457
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:08,159
So we do not say that this blood cell is good
and that blood cell is bad.

458
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,049
Or this blood cell is higher, that blood cell
is higher.

459
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:15,039
In the same way everybody is circulating.

460
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:17,240
So one should not have any fear.

461
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,190
Also fear of the leader should not be there.

462
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,139
There’s no need to fear the leader.

463
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:24,039
If you are on your gravity you keep to it.

464
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:25,179
He will understand you.

465
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:30,139
As long as leader is on the gravity he’ll
be there, as soon as he goes away from the

466
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:33,329
gravity he’ll go away himself.

467
00:34:33,329 --> 00:34:39,179
So you stand on your own gravity point and
nobody can disturb you.

468
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:41,740
You should have no fear, nothing.

469
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,829
Nothing to bother in Sahaja Yoga.

470
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:45,230
As it is you are all saints.

471
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,619
What is there to bother?

472
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:54,249
The whole ganas, all the angels, all this
All-pervading Power is looking after you.

473
00:34:54,249 --> 00:35:01,330
Yesterday we saw a kind of a light, miraculous
light, following us on both the sides of the

474
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:02,330
car.

475
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:05,920
Especially on my side there was such a lot
of light following.

476
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,910
Just giving [an] indication that it’s alright,
this is Ganesha’s place and here things

477
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,660
are going to work out.

478
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:21,440
So you are placed so well, you have so many
powers within yourself and which you can express

479
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,369
very well.

480
00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:25,859
Fearlessly you can have it within yourself.

481
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:31,140
Anybody who tries to trouble you will be looked
after by this All-pervading Power, you don’t

482
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,210
have to do anything about it.

483
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:38,160
So try to see: are you in balance in any way.

484
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,349
Some people are too much attached to their
family and some people are detached.

485
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:46,089
Too much attachment to family is also wrong.

486
00:35:46,089 --> 00:35:47,810
What is the need to be attached so much?

487
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:49,200
You’ll spoil your children.

488
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,670
When they grow up they hit you back.

489
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:56,789
So best is to keep them in balance, have a
detached attitude towards life.

490
00:35:56,789 --> 00:36:03,749
And this detached attitude, as I had told
you, is like the sap in the tree which goes

491
00:36:03,749 --> 00:36:05,499
to all the places.

492
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:11,599
If it is surplus it can evaporate or it can
go down, but it doesn’t stick to anything,

493
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:18,369
because if it sticks to anything, that involvement
will kill that tree and also kill that part,

494
00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:20,880
that flower, where it is sticking on to.

495
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:27,590
So we see that attached love is the death
of the love.

496
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:36,210
So we have to have a proper understanding
of this detached love, where you stand on

497
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:44,559
your gravity and you have concern about everyone,
you think about everyone.

498
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:57,839
In case you find that somebody is not alright,
you don’t lose your balance, but get that

499
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,210
person in the balance.

500
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:05,980
If you start losing your balance then how
can you get back that person.

501
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:16,069
And in that way you will lose all your hatred,
all your anger, all your lust, or what you

502
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:21,460
can call, all your competition, all that.

503
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,183
Because you stand in your own dignity.

504
00:37:23,183 --> 00:37:26,900
You don’t want [a] certificate from anyone.

505
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:32,619
You don’t want any praising from anyone.

506
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:34,660
You just know that you are there.

507
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,180
And you are self-contented.

508
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:41,890
Then it’s not also necessary that, “Mother
must give me a special audience!”

509
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:43,400
It’s all ego.

510
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,509
“I must see Mother!

511
00:37:45,509 --> 00:37:47,460
I have to see her privately!”

512
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,890
What is the need to see me privately?

513
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:53,470
I am never private I am available every time
to you, all the time.

514
00:37:53,470 --> 00:38:00,880
So all these things are coming out of the
ignorance and out of the fact that you are

515
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,740
not on your gravity point.

516
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:09,280
So today, to begin with, we have this Ganesh
puja where we all should, in our heart, think

517
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,710
what is our gravity point and [on] that we
have to stand very firm.

518
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:17,339
May God bless you.
