1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,360
First time when I came
to United States,

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,400
I came to Los Angeles first.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,680
Because it’s a place of angels.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,000
Actually, I thought

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:20,040
that it must be a very holy place
to come down first of all

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,800
in this great land
of United States.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,080
Now, as you know that United States —
or America, the whole of it —

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,240
is the Vishuddhi Chakra.

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,440
Out of which, we have three sides
to the Vishuddhi Chakra.

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,840
So, the central part
of the Vishuddhi Chakra

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,720
is United States.

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,400
The central part
of the Vishuddhi Chakra

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,320
is governed by Shri Krishna.

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,080
And His power is Radha.

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,400
Ra-dha. “Ra” means “energy”,

16
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,240
“dha” is the one
who has sustained the energy.

17
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,680
Ra-dha. Dha-re-ti-sa.

18
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,920
So She is the one
who has sustained the energy,

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,480
and so She is called as Radha.

20
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,440
She is the power of Shri Krishna.

21
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,680
The word Krishna comes
from the word <i>krishi</i>,

22
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,720
means “the ploughing”,

23
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,520
or you can say, agriculture
is called as <i>krishi</i>.

24
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,240
The one who ploughs

25
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:41,040
and puts the seed in the soil
is doing the <i>krishi</i>.

26
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,400
And that’s why He is called
as Krishna.

27
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,040
Now, the seed that He has sown

28
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:55,240
is the seed of spirituality.

29
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,600
It is Shri Krishna
who said, in Sanskrit:

30
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,920
“<i>Nainam chhindanti shastrani
nainam dahati pavakah</i>

31
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,480
<i>na chainam kledayantyapo
na shoshayati marutah</i>”
(Bhagavad Gita, Ch. II, V. 23),

32
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,680
meaning it cannot be —
means the spiritual life,

33
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,040
or you can say, the eternal life,
or the Spirit —

34
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,200
cannot be killed by anything,

35
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,360
by any weapon,

36
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,720
neither can be blown away by air,

37
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:32,040
nor can it be sucked in,
nor can it be destroyed.

38
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,360
So, to prove that,
Christ came on this earth,

39
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,800
and through His resurrection
He proved what Shri Krishna had said.

40
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,360
And most of you Sahaja yogis
know the relationship

41
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,760
of Christ and Shri Krishna,
why He was called Christ.

42
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,760
Christ word comes
from the same — <i>krishi</i>.

43
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,920
And His first name comes
from the word Yashoda.

44
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,200
Yashoda is also called
as Jesu or Yesu,

45
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,400
and that’s why

46
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,720
Christ was called
as Jesu or Yesu.

47
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,840
Some people call Him Yesu,
and some people call Him as Jesu,

48
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,760
because of Yashoda, the mother,
foster mother of Shri Krishna.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Also, you know that Radha
was the same as Mahalakshmi,

50
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,200
so She was the same
as the mother of Christ, Mary.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,120
These, all these things,
we can prove it in Sahaja Yoga.

52
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,360
Because when the Kundalini
moves up to the Vishuddhi Chakra

53
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,920
and if it stops there,
you can ask the question:

54
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,520
“Was Krishna the son
of Mother Mary—

55
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,200
was Jesus the son
of Mother Mary?

56
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,400
Was the son of Ra— was [Mary]
the same as Radha?”,

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,880
and then the Kundalini moves.

58
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,880
So Sahaja Yoga today is the thing

59
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,520
which proves
what has been said so far.

60
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,840
It proves. It’s not
just a cock-and-bull story.

61
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,920
Because people do not believe
into all these things.

62
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,720
They think that it’s all
cock-and-bull story:

63
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,120
who was Christ, who was Krishna,
who was Radha…
after all, there was no God.

64
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,480
But only in Sahaja Yoga, today,

65
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,720
we can prove it,
that what we say is the truth.

66
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:32,360
Because, as through Realisation,
you get connected to the mains.

67
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,680
Your vibrations start flowing.

68
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,720
Like the computer,
you start working.

69
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,560
And whatever question you ask,

70
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,440
answer comes to you
as tremendous vibrations,

71
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,320
or it stops, or you might get heat,
or you might get blisters…

72
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,160
So the whole message
is communicated to you

73
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,360
through your fingertips.

74
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,240
As Mohammed Saheb
has very clearly said

75
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,440
that “At the time of resurrection,
your hands will speak.”

76
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,320
But the Muslims do not want
to talk about resurrection at all.

77
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,040
Because they want to frighten
people with the doomsday.

78
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,440
They don’t want to talk
about the resurrection time,

79
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,400
which is going to come,
which is the intermediary time.

80
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,280
Because they want
to use the time

81
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,680
which will frighten people,

82
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,960
by saying that “Now your doomsday
is coming!”

83
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,320
“Now your doomsday is coming” —
so everybody is frightened about God,

84
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,000
and they think that “Now we should
just wait for our doom,

85
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,040
nothing else is in between.”

86
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,280
So this is how the Vishuddhi Chakra
is a special one.

87
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:45,480
Now, Vishuddhi Chakra
was created on the Saturday.

88
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,120
So it is the Saturn —

89
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,920
that’s the important star
of the Vishuddhi Chakra.

90
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,720
So, whenever the Saturn
is at the highest,

91
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,280
America will be in a better place
to do things.

92
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:04,480
But I don’t think they know much
about themselves.

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,760
They don’t know what they are,
why they are on this earth,

94
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,680
what is their work,
what they are supposed to do,

95
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,680
or what is the purpose of God
of creating America.

96
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,960
The first job
of the Vishuddhi Chakra within us

97
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,800
was that when we became
human beings,

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,640
we raised our heads up like that.

99
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,120
When you raise your head up like that,
you have become a human being,

100
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,200
in the sense that now
there is a new movement

101
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,080
in your consciousness.

102
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,120
Now, the new movement
in your consciousness

103
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,400
started about six thousand
years back

104
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,640
when Shri Krishna came
on this earth.

105
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,800
That the new movement was
that it is the Father,

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,600
the advent of the Father
was celebrated.

107
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,000
And that’s how people developed

108
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:03,200
a kind of a new instrument
within themselves called ego.

109
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,400
When the brain
was lifted like this, you see,

110
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,000
it expanded in a pyramidical…

111
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,440
it’s a pyramid,
it became a pyramid.

112
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,920
In an animal, the brain is flat.
And gradually, it rises.

113
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,720
When the head was raised,
when the responsibility was taken
of raising the head,

114
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,760
the brain started growing
in such a way

115
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,200
that it became a pyramid.

116
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,600
And when it became a pyramid,

117
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,880
the attention became
a different attention

118
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,040
from that of animal.

119
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,520
Because when the waves
of your consciousness

120
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,440
fell on the sides of the pyramid,

121
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,120
they went into the parallelogram
of forces,

122
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,160
by which the resultant force —

123
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,760
the resultant force —
now, it falls like this,

124
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,120
goes like that,
the resultant force is like that —

125
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,960
had two sides: one was this,
another was this.

126
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,120
So the consciousness,
or we can say, the attention,

127
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,480
instead of going inside,
started going out.

128
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,800
So one part of the resultant
was going outside,

129
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,160
and that’s how,
when you became a human being,

130
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,360
your attention went outside.

131
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,160
It’s the human beings only
who have their attention outside.

132
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,200
Not that the animals don’t have,

133
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,000
but the attention
of human beings are such

134
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,000
that they create reactions.

135
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,600
Like, you see something.

136
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,080
Now, I see doctor’s house there,
for example.

137
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,240
Then a reaction starts
in my mind:

138
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,000
What is this?…
What does this mean?…

139
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,040
How much it must have cost?…
From where did he buy it?…

140
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,000
Anything you see,
it starts giving you a reaction.

141
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,440
Not to the animals.

142
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,120
Animals, at the most
they will say, “This I must eat.

143
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,120
That I must eat.
That I must get.”

144
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,240
But they do not think about it.

145
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,400
It’s only the human beings
who reflect.

146
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:10,240
And this reflection comes
because of the pyramid-like structure

147
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,880
of the brain.

148
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,600
And this has a special reaction
in the brain itself,

149
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,840
that we start developing
our own ego,

150
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,600
our own myths,
our own mental projections.

151
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,040
And when we develop
our own mental projections,

152
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,640
this ego starts developing:
“I know,” “What’s wrong?” —

153
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,880
all these nonsensical
things come.

154
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,720
And once that starts working out,
the balloon of the ego starts rising.

155
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,320
It starts pushing the other balloon
which was within us —

156
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,480
is of the superego —
as an animal,

157
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,200
and then comes up in the centre.

158
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,760
That’s how we now become
normal human beings.

159
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,040
But then we start
increasing our ego.

160
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,320
It starts overlapping
the superego,

161
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:08,760
and a calcification takes place,
by which we develop our “I-ness”.

162
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,520
So it is all the happening
that takes place

163
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,560
after we have lifted our head,
raised our head,

164
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,720
and we are no more like animals.

165
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,760
So, Vishuddhi Chakra

166
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,160
has a very big part to play
in the human evolution —

167
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,680
that by developing
your Vishuddhi Chakra,

168
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,600
you have become
human beings, first of all.

169
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,840
Secondly, because it is
the chakra of the Father,

170
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,760
who becomes again
the primordial…

171
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,480
as you call it in…

172
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,520
(Shri Mataji says
several words in Marathi)…

173
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,880
macrocosm,

174
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,560
you become the macrocosm.

175
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,440
You are the microcosm,

176
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,880
and the Father is the macrocosm.

177
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:09,200
So you become that
because of the Vishuddhi Chakra,

178
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,600
which is governed
by Shri Krishna,

179
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,880
who becomes that macrocosm
called as Virat.

180
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,720
In the brain it is expressed
in this part,

181
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,240
in this part of the head.

182
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,400
It is here

183
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:30,400
that you start manifesting
your macrocosm qualities.

184
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,120
At this point.

185
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,000
Now, this Vishuddhi Chakra
has a speciality —

186
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,040
is that we always say,
“The responsibility on my shoulders.”

187
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,880
Always we say, “The responsibilities
are on my shoulders.”

188
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,640
The reason is,

189
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,080
the Vishuddhi Chakra gives you
the sense of responsibility.

190
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,720
And that’s why, you know,
the Americans feel responsible
for the whole world.

191
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,920
Naturally.

192
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,120
It’s perfectly understood

193
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,160
that they feel responsible
for the whole world.

194
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:10,240
But how much they are aware
of their role

195
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,120
as the responsible people,
that’s a different point.

196
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,120
But they feel
they are responsible.

197
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:22,000
But their role as responsible people
if they understand,

198
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,200
then they have to be ideals!

199
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,600
Ideals!

200
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,400
Because a person who is
the responsible person in a family

201
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,240
has to be the ideal for others.

202
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,240
It started very well, I should say,
at the time of Abraham Lincoln.

203
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,920
It started very well.

204
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,120
When you started talking
about democracy, is also…

205
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,160
democracy is nothing
but collectivity.

206
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,440
He started talking about collectivity
“of the people, by the people”
(Gettysburg Address).

207
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,320
All that shows that the sense
of collectivity

208
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,040
started coming right
in this Vishuddhi Chakra.

209
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,840
But then,

210
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,760
the people who are in the centre

211
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,040
can only remain normal.

212
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,080
But those who bend too much,

213
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,000
or who bend backward too much,

214
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,400
both suffer from problems.

215
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,480
The ones who bend forward
to others are the people

216
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,360
who get their superego.

217
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,600
They get over-humbled down,
like developing countries are.

218
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,760
And those who bend backward
are the people

219
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,480
who try to dominate others,

220
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,840
who have ego.

221
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,520
So, because of sudden
blessings of God,

222
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,160
they discovered so many things.

223
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,080
The ego started developing
in America too much.

224
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,480
But ego is like a balloon,
as I told you,

225
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,960
and keeps you floating
in the air.

226
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,720
And when you are in the air,
you become shallow people.

227
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,920
You have no moorings.

228
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,160
But it has one more advantage.

229
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,720
If you knew you are floating
in the air,

230
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,320
you can have a complete
comprehensive view,

231
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,920
complete vision of the whole —

232
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:19,120
if your eyes are pure
and your intentions are clear-cut.

233
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:25,480
Now, the another thing
that happened by their coming here

234
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,480
was the problem

235
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,600
that they felt that “We are
a very new nation.”

236
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,600
It has an advantage,
as well as it has a disadvantage.

237
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,000
To advantage is that if you are new,
it’s very good

238
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:46,080
because you can be transformed
into something better very easily

239
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,480
because there is no conditioning
in your mind.

240
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,800
You are very clean,

241
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,840
absolutely ready
to become something great.

242
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,680
Or else, can be a possibility
that you are so new

243
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,480
that you are awed
by everything that is old,

244
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,880
which is very true
about Americans,

245
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:13,480
that they bought
all the old bridges from England

246
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,120
to bring them down here.

247
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,560
And the cravings about the old
is too much here.

248
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,200
And that as if whatever is new
is all absurd.

249
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,400
So maybe even Sahaja Yoga
may be an absurd thing for them.

250
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,000
Because, according to them,
this is something new.

251
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,680
Because they are new nations,

252
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,680
they have started discarding
all that is new.

253
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,040
Is an absurd thing.

254
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,640
Now, we must say
that Sahaja Yoga, as it is today,

255
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,280
is the most ancient thing.

256
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,640
It started with the universe,

257
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,040
and now the culmination point
has come.

258
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,800
Because it is a living process.

259
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,360
As you see a flower on the tree,
so you’d say, “First new flower.”

260
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,880
But the flower
has come out of a seed,

261
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,000
which has got the roots;
then it became the trunk;

262
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,040
then it became the leaves;

263
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,920
and then it has now become
a flower.

264
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,800
So, though it looks a new flower,
it has a big heritage.

265
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,440
In the same way, Sahaja Yoga
is as ancient as this universe is.

266
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:28,640
But to people who have
such a hankering for traditionalism,

267
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,160
find it difficult to find out
what is real tradition.

268
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,600
Only those who are traditional people
can know what is real tradition.

269
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,920
Last time I came here in America
and I was shocked:

270
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,520
that a person came
to interview Me,

271
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,000
and when he was talking,
he asked about one gentleman

272
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,360
who was most untraditional
from Indian point of view.

273
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,920
His name was
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa
(well-known Indian religious figure).

274
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,120
He married a woman
and made her a “Mother”
(Ramakrishna declared his wife
as an incarnation of the Divine Mother).

275
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,640
I mean, it’s… nobody has done it.
Rama has not done it.
Krishna has not done it.

276
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,080
An absurd stuff!

277
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,080
But for them,
he was the most traditional man.

278
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,760
And he told Me that “Mother,
your Sahaja Yoga is not traditional

279
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,240
if you don’t believe
in Ramakrishna.”

280
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:17,600
Last fifty-sixty years, all such
neo-traditional people came up.

281
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,640
Another one was this Pondicherry fellow
(Aurobindo, whose ashram
is situated in Pondicherry).

282
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,320
Another absurd situation.

283
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,040
He called this woman a “Mother”
(Aurobindo declared Mirra Alfassa
as an incarnation of the Divine Mother),

284
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,240
and his relation with her
is ambiguous.

285
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,520
You don’t know
what relationship they had.

286
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,840
I mean, that is something,
in Indian tradition…

287
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,680
is an impossible situation.

288
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,640
You have to have clear-cut
relationship with everyone,

289
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,560
you cannot have ambiguous.

290
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,200
Neither a friend, nor a wife,
nor a mother or a sister…

291
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,080
That kind of a situation
is most untraditional.

292
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,520
Is never thought of.

293
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,840
I mean, you Indians can know
this is not possible.

294
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,960
This is an absurd situation.

295
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,520
But for some people,
he is traditional.

296
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,520
What happened
about sixty years back —

297
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,800
I think, about the time
of My birth only —

298
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,520
the negativity started taking
a new form

299
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,040
in understanding
the western confusion.

300
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,520
They are all westernised,
if you see them.

301
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,640
And the western confusion
they took over

302
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,040
for their own advantages.

303
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,800
They used it
for their own advantages.

304
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,640
And this is where the western people
have failed to make them out.

305
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,760
The other day,
at the Jungian place,

306
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,000
I was to talk to Jung people
about Sahaja Yoga and Jung.

307
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,160
Now, Jung, I came to know
only when he died,

308
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,720
because there was a little article
about him.

309
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,720
I never studied psychology.

310
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,880
Of course, I tried to learn
some vocabulary to talk to them.

311
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,960
Sometimes, I thought,
I may have to talk to them also.

312
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,000
But these Jungians,
all very intellectuals and great people

313
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,640
sitting before Me, you see.

314
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,840
About a hundred of them,
[and] the President
of American Jungian Society.

315
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,040
I’d just gone through a book,
just before starting it,

316
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,560
and I saw some diagram
which really puzzled Me.

317
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,520
The first conception they had…

318
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,600
Of course, it’s all a mental
conception of Jung.

319
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,440
I don’t blame him,
because he got Realisation

320
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,840
but he did not know
how the state was created,

321
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,560
what was the framework
of the state,

322
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,320
and his movement
was still of a seeker

323
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,760
to find out how he got
his Realisation.

324
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,800
And all movements were linear,

325
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,640
they were not expanding
from one point all over.

326
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,000
So it was not so integrated.

327
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,960
Now, the thing they showed was

328
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,400
that at the bottom of it
was the unconscious

329
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,280
which is never going
to be conscious;

330
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,000
on top of that was the conscious…
unconscious that can be conscious;

331
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,560
then, there was subconscious;
and on top of that was the ego.

332
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,400
I mean, what a mess of a thing
it was, I tell you.

333
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:59,160
I told them, see, now, the word
“unconscious” itself is confusing.

334
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,040
What do you mean
by “unconscious”?

335
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,920
Whatever you don’t feel
on your central nervous system
is unconscious, all right.

336
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,280
But what does that mean?

337
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,800
We don’t feel the subconscious —

338
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,240
then subconscious is also
unconscious.

339
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,520
Whatever we don’t feel —
for example, there are certain sounds

340
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,760
of certain frequencies
we don’t hear at all.

341
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,600
We hear whatever is tolerable
to us as human beings.

342
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,760
That you all scientists know.
We don’t hear everything.

343
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,160
So, all that is unconscious —
means it’s a mixed bag,

344
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,600
all sorts of things
mixed up together.

345
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,960
But God is not a hotchpotch
person, you see.

346
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,640
He is a clear-cut gentleman.

347
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,920
He knows what He is doing,
He is the greatest organiser.

348
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,720
And how can He put you
into a bag like that —

349
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,720
that the unconscious is below;

350
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,280
then on top of it is the unconscious
that is going to be conscious;

351
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,280
on top of it is the subconscious;

352
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,040
on top of [it is] the consciousness;
on top of that, the ego!

353
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,360
So you go down
carrying all this inside you,

354
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,800
and where do you go?

355
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,360
Now, how do you go?

356
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,720
So the first mistake was

357
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,360
that there are layers
one on top of other.

358
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,800
It’s not so.

359
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,320
They are placed vertically!

360
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:25,160
The ego is on the right-hand side,
and superego, on the left-hand side.

361
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,000
The future, on the right-hand side,
and the past, on the left-hand side.

362
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,600
So, the subconscious,
on the left-hand side,

363
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,160
and the supraconscious,
on the right-hand side.

364
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,400
And the central path
is kept clear-cut.

365
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,280
I mean, in any organisation…

366
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,960
say, if you go to the airport,

367
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,040
do you have like this
that you have to pass
through the walls

368
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,120
to go to the aeroplane?

369
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,800
If we human beings don’t commit
such horrible mistakes,

370
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,520
how can God commit
such a mistake?

371
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,800
So it was absolutely wrong
to think that way.

372
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,960
So, the central path is
in the centre,

373
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,320
while the right side is
on the right side,

374
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,560
and the left side
on the left side.

375
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,640
And you don’t have to go
to the subconscious at all!

376
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,840
Because they justified
all these people

377
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,040
who are trying
to make them hypnosis,

378
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,640
or they are trying
to hypnotise them

379
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,680
or to give them a new type of a…
sort of an experience.

380
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,880
“All that was unconscious,
we should accept that.”

381
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,760
Even some people,
if they start suddenly jumping,
they say, “Oh, it’s great!”

382
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,000
So the sensations that you get

383
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,400
from the subconscious
and the supraconscious

384
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,400
were accepted
as something great.

385
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,760
It was a confusion
of your intellectuals, I should say.

386
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,960
Complete.

387
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,320
But it is not so.

388
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,400
Your path is straightforward.
Absolutely for Kundalini.

389
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,440
Only thing, the one who has to raise it
had to come, that’s all.

390
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,920
But otherwise,
it’s all very well,

391
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,440
and there is no need for you
to get into that horrible subconscious.

392
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,600
When I told them, they were amazed.
They said, “Mother, it is so simple!”

393
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,000
I said, “It’s very simple.
Your unconscious is divided into four.

394
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,880
One is the collective
subconscious,

395
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,080
one is the collective
supraconscious,

396
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,240
one is, you can say,
the collective hell,

397
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:18,440
and on top is the super-collective
consciousness.

398
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,120
So, where do we have to go?
We should know our destination.

399
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,480
Then, we have to reach it.”

400
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,360
And that is how the problem
of all these people

401
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,800
getting entangled with Muktanand
(founder of Siddha Yoga).

402
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,240
Yesterday they asked Me a question,
“What’s wrong with Muktanand?
Why is he so dangerous?”

403
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,720
One lady, poor thing,
as sahaj would have it,

404
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,880
she came, she said,
“Oh, I went there, I broke my back,
and I’m finished once and for all.

405
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,960
He is such a dangerous man!
He flattered me,

406
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,400
I went there, and I don’t know
what has happened to my back.

407
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,920
I can’t sit for more than ten minutes
in one place, I have to get up.

408
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,280
And I have a vibrator,
I have to always put it…” — like that.

409
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,480
So I said, “See. The dangers.”

410
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:02,720
Then the another theory they started
that we must suffer
if we are to go to God. Why?

411
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:06,880
I mean, that’s not God’s idea
by any chance.
Why should you suffer?

412
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,880
He made Christ suffer for you.

413
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,360
Finished now, now you better not suffer.
There’s no need to suffer at all.

414
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:17,800
So, all these ideas penetrated
into these western people.

415
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,840
And this mental projection
they accepted

416
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,000
without even understanding
what is written in other books.
We should see.

417
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,880
And they could only go
as far as those sixty years

418
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,720
when these horrible people

419
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,640
who went to India, very shallow people,
they saw some of these tantric books,

420
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,840
because they wanted to justify Freud
through Indian culture.

421
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,720
So they got the tantrikas,
erotic things and all that

422
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,200
and brought these books.

423
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,640
And some of them read
I don’t know what books,

424
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,760
to say that Kundalini [is]
in the stomach;
somebody says, in the brain…

425
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,640
I mean, they don’t know
where the Kundalini is.

426
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,400
And they are writing
such big, big books.

427
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,880
Can you imagine?
Such big, big books they have written!

428
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,560
Now, when the books are written,
every book is not a scripture.

429
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,360
But to them, if it is written
in the book, you see, it’s a scripture.

430
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,680
And that’s how the whole confusion
started going on.

431
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,640
So these people came down,
took full advantage of it,

432
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,120
and now they have become
“great gurus”

433
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,680
with lot of money.

434
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,480
Rich people.

435
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:22,400
But now,
as the hand of God is great,

436
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,880
one by one they are getting out

437
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:33,240
of the heads of these people.

438
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,680
And now I hope a day will come

439
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,240
when people will see
the light through.

440
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,040
So the task of Sahaja Yoga is
to establish the truth within yourself.

441
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,720
It is not that we can have
a membership.

442
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,000
We cannot have a person
enrol into it.

443
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,920
We cannot call them
as branded Sahaja yogis.

444
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,080
It’s the growth of the person
that is to be seen.

445
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,640
Now, there are so many lectures
which I have given

446
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,840
about <i>ritambhara pragnya</i>
and all those things,

447
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,760
and I think for every Sahaja yogi
it is necessary

448
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,800
to listen to those lectures,

449
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,720
go through it, understand them,
and to meditate, so that you grow.

450
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,440
Because it’s not a plastic thing
that we can create.

451
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,600
It’s a living process

452
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:23,760
of the living energy
of the living God.

453
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,800
And so, it has to grow
within you.

454
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,440
By thinking
you cannot make it grow,

455
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,160
but by not thinking
you allow it to grow more and more.

456
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,120
As it starts growing within you,

457
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,120
then only you realise
that what you are.

458
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,920
That’s the only way you have to reach
a state of that super-consciousness

459
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,240
and establish yourself there.

460
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,320
Then only you will know
what I am talking about.

461
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,920
Now, today’s puja
is another thing.

462
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,880
Now, what is a puja?

463
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,000
Can you people say
what’s a puja is?

464
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,200
Actually, yesterday I had a puja…

465
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,760
and it’s not easy for Me to bear
the pujas, to be very frank, you know.

466
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,280
Because the vibrations are so much
that… I don’t know…

467
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,720
And then I went to the airport;
two hours, we took out the vibrations

468
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,360
and put them
for all the New York airport.

469
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,800
It was necessary.
It worked out.

470
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,320
Because vibrations start flowing
with tremendous force,

471
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,680
and if you people
do not absorb it,

472
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,320
it takes time for it to ooze out
from My body.

473
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,440
Makes Me rather heavy with it.

474
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,160
But then it oozes out,
I feel better…

475
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,200
And only thing that happens
by saying the mantras —

476
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,280
that you awaken the deities
within yourself

477
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,320
and start receiving
the vibrations.

478
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,520
And when your deities
are awakened,

479
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,800
they are awakened through the power
of the deities within Me —

480
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,920
they have to work very hard
to do that,

481
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,600
and that’s how they emit
too much vibrations,

482
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,560
which must be absorbed by you
when your deities are awakened.

483
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,400
That’s how it works.

484
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,720
You cannot describe it in words,
you cannot tell it in words.

485
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,160
It’s a happening
that has to take place.

486
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,720
Many people who come
to Sahaja Yoga first

487
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,360
can go little bit like that
in the beginning.

488
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,440
Gradually they settle down,

489
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,040
come round, grow into it —
then it becomes all right.

490
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,640
Some people just shoot off
in one day, and they are there.

491
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,840
Makes no difference whatsoever.

492
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:27,720
Because it’s a growing thing
and it has to grow.

493
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,040
With some people,
the land is so fertile,

494
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,840
or maybe something,
that it just works out fast.

495
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,040
So, nobody should blame anyone.

496
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,200
And specially,
one should not feel guilty,

497
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,960
because that’s the Vishuddhi
on the left-hand side.

498
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,600
Specially for America,
I am wearing this stone,

499
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,120
which is called
as the black sapphire.

500
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,240
Because this is the stone
of Shri Krishna.

501
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,200
It’s the stone
of Vishuddhi Chakra.

502
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,680
Every chakra has a stone,

503
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,840
and this is the stone
of the Vishuddhi Chakra,

504
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:01,120
so I am wearing this,
just for coming to America.

505
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:06,600
And I hope that today’s worship

506
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:13,720
will bring out the potential
of this country

507
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,920
by exciting the deities,

508
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,720
Shri Krishna himself,
who is in charge,

509
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:26,640
by pleasing Him,
by making Him active.

510
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,200
And He has great qualities,

511
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,760
and one of the greatest
qualities He has — that He has
the <i>samhara shakti</i>,

512
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,200
by which He can kill the demons.

513
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,760
And all those demons
who are settled down here

514
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,040
are really mistaken.

515
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,040
Because if this is the place
of Shri Krishna,

516
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,120
they are very dangerously placed.

517
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,480
Because once He is awakened here,
they all will be completely finished

518
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,320
through His Sudarshan Chakra,
which He has in His hand,

519
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,200
and He can just kill them
one by one.

520
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,880
But first, He is to be pleased,
and He is to be awakened.

521
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,480
He has to be…
<i>prasanna</i>, that’s the word.

522
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,360
<i>Prasanna</i> means “to be pleased”.

523
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,000
And then, it works out.

524
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,600
So today first we’ll have
Ganesha’s puja, little bit,

525
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:16,720
because Ganesha’s puja is meant
just to establish the innocence,

526
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,400
the innocence of the place.

527
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,920
Once the innocence is established —
that’s the most important,

528
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,600
that’s the essence of everything,
Ganesha is the essence! —

529
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,840
and then we’ll have
Shri Krishna puja,

530
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:32,240
and then the puja of the Devi,
of the Power.

531
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,400
So, that’s how we’ll have three pujas,
one after another,

532
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,560
but a short time every time.

533
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,760
All right?
