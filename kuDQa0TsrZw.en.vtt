00:04:44.795 --> 00:04:48.335
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:04:54.895 --> 00:04:57.875
You are all here to seek the truth.

00:04:59.355 --> 00:05:05.375
One has to realize that truth is what it is.

00:05:08.075 --> 00:05:13.815
We have to know the truth; Truth does not have to know us.

00:05:16.515 --> 00:05:23.135
And the truth lies within us, within our being and the instrument

00:05:23.435 --> 00:05:28.135
of knowing the truth is what he has described it to you today.

00:05:32.715 --> 00:05:40.195
Now if you have got your eyes, you can see clearly

00:05:41.855 --> 00:05:47.915
that this is a white color. You don't have to pay to your eyes for that -

00:05:48.475 --> 00:05:52.655
that's a truth. You all see the same thing.

00:05:55.675 --> 00:06:02.135
If you are passing through a dirty lane, it's obnoxious

00:06:04.075 --> 00:06:10.375
and you know it's a dirty lane you're passing through.

00:06:11.095 --> 00:06:16.075
But a dog does not know the truth, a horse does not know.

00:06:17.255 --> 00:06:22.495
They can all pass through that without feeling anything about it.

00:06:25.935 --> 00:06:32.055
So you are at a higher level than all the animals put together,

00:06:32.875 --> 00:06:40.295
all the living things that you see, you are at a higher place.

00:06:42.475 --> 00:06:46.515
So, what is the purpose

00:06:48.315 --> 00:06:51.315
of our being human-beings.

00:06:55.075 --> 00:07:00.695
The only purpose is to know the truth.

00:07:03.355 --> 00:07:08.975
Many people say that truth is love and love is truth.

00:07:10.035 --> 00:07:17.495
People don't understand. At human level it's a very illusive,

00:07:18.595 --> 00:07:26.615
deceiving sentence. Maybe, love may not be the truth, truth may not be love.

00:07:31.675 --> 00:07:36.275
But when they say truth is love, they mean to say

00:07:37.295 --> 00:07:42.335
that the All- Pervading power of God'e love

00:07:43.875 --> 00:07:47.175
which is in a subtle form,

00:07:48.395 --> 00:07:55.055
which runs all our living processes

00:07:58.295 --> 00:08:02.155
is the truth.

00:08:03.935 --> 00:08:08.115
All of them, all the great Scriptures have described

00:08:10.675 --> 00:08:16.235
that All-Pervading power of God exists.

00:08:18.375 --> 00:08:26.175
You have never felt it so, you should keep your minds open about it.

00:08:26.875 --> 00:08:32.655
Not to close your minds - it's unscientific, I think, to close your minds.

00:08:33.355 --> 00:08:39.695
And if there is something existing like that, why should we not know it?

00:08:43.835 --> 00:08:50.675
It is our birthright to know about that truth which pervades

00:08:53.235 --> 00:08:55.955
all over.

00:08:57.415 --> 00:09:03.735
Scientifically it is said that we have evolved from amoeba stage.

00:09:05.675 --> 00:09:12.835
Why have we evolved from amoeba stage to human stage and have we reached our last stage?

00:09:15.135 --> 00:09:21.635
Have we reached our Absolute stage? Are we at an Absolute point?

00:09:22.235 --> 00:09:28.075
We are not. The proof is we are in a chaos.

00:09:29.555 --> 00:09:36.555
We do not know what is right, what is wrong. We cannot say this is right and this is wrong.

00:09:38.195 --> 00:09:41.635
All of us do not say the same thing.

00:09:43.535 --> 00:09:50.075
Then that's not the truth because we have not reached the stage where

00:09:52.435 --> 00:09:57.175
we feel the truth, all of us the same.

00:10:01.955 --> 00:10:05.995
But our idea about truth is very different.

00:10:07.595 --> 00:10:12.655
I've already told you, it's not an idea; Truth is what it is -

00:10:12.895 --> 00:10:16.715
is the existence of Truth.

00:10:19.815 --> 00:10:24.575
So some people think that truth is in belonging to certain faiths

00:10:27.035 --> 00:10:33.835
or believing into certain groups or into some fanaticism

00:10:35.075 --> 00:10:42.975
or could be some sort of a false guru who does not know the truth itself.

00:10:47.415 --> 00:10:55.435
But one should know one thing for definite that if we have to evolve, it has to be done through some living process.

00:10:59.995 --> 00:11:06.895
And the living process cannot be explained but can be experienced.

00:11:08.655 --> 00:11:13.835
Now in the human body anything foreign that goes in is thrown out.

00:11:15.915 --> 00:11:19.235
But when a lady conceives

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:26.895
that foreign body is nourished, nurtured and thrown out at a right point.

00:11:30.195 --> 00:11:33.495
Nobody can explain how it happens.

00:11:36.675 --> 00:11:41.275
It can be explained what is the mechanism that works it out.

00:11:42.175 --> 00:11:47.975
In the same way one can explain the mechanism that works out your re-birth

00:11:49.915 --> 00:11:55.695
where you know the truth and the truth dawns upon you

00:11:56.495 --> 00:12:04.495
that you are the Spirit, you are the reflector of God.

00:12:07.415 --> 00:12:11.935
This is the truth you have to know.

00:12:13.955 --> 00:12:18.935
For that, there is a mechanism placed within us beautifully.

00:12:20.775 --> 00:12:26.635
Of course, doctors may not know about it for the time being - they know little bit.

00:12:28.075 --> 00:12:32.815
Then the Parasympathetic Nervous System they call it, about which they don't know much.

00:12:34.435 --> 00:12:40.695
Now within us lies, as you see, the three channels -

00:12:41.095 --> 00:12:46.415
one on the left, one on the right and one in the center of the Autonomous Nervous System.

00:12:48.635 --> 00:12:54.215
And these three channels represent on the left side

00:12:56.615 --> 00:13:02.675
the emotional side, the desire side and the right channel

00:13:02.935 --> 00:13:07.455
is for the actions of these emotions and desires

00:13:08.315 --> 00:13:15.675
and the central path is for coordinating and co-operating.

00:13:20.215 --> 00:13:25.135
All the problems that human-beings have

00:13:25.615 --> 00:13:30.775
are caused by their imbalances - very simple thing it is.

00:13:31.255 --> 00:13:37.755
If you go to the roots of everything, this is the knowledge of the roots, of our roots.

00:13:39.295 --> 00:13:44.335
They're very simple problems because

00:13:45.275 --> 00:13:50.295
When you have imbalances, when you go too much to the left

00:13:50.575 --> 00:13:54.495
or too much to the right, you create imbalances.

00:13:56.475 --> 00:13:59.635
and these imbalances cause

00:14:00.195 --> 00:14:05.435
physical, mental, emotional, spiritual problems.

00:14:09.375 --> 00:14:17.455
Of course there could be also Psychosomatic both combined - like emotional combined with physical also.

00:14:19.115 --> 00:14:25.675
But it's a simple thing is that you go into an extreme

00:14:27.895 --> 00:14:35.795
in anything. The human nature is such that we must go to the extremes.

00:14:38.015 --> 00:14:42.655
Like one gentleman used to smoke a lot and I started coughing.

00:14:44.975 --> 00:14:50.555
It was a no smoking zone. I requested the gentleman, "Sir, if you don't mind

00:14:51.275 --> 00:14:56.295
I've to give a speech in the evening, can you stop smoking?" He said, "No, I can't."

00:14:58.055 --> 00:15:02.615
I kept quiet. So he has a double problem.

00:15:03.495 --> 00:15:11.395
First is the problem that he cannot get over his habit - that is his left side

00:15:11.795 --> 00:15:16.895
and the another problem is the right side that he cannot get over his ego.

00:15:18.155 --> 00:15:21.295
Such combinations could be there.

00:15:22.315 --> 00:15:29.715
But basically the problem is that you cannot remain in the center, in the balance.

00:15:31.995 --> 00:15:36.775
Sometimes you go to one extreme, from there you go to another extreme.

00:15:38.535 --> 00:15:44.315
Like some people who're extremely dominating, very arrogant,

00:15:45.355 --> 00:15:50.955
hot-tempered, suddenly become very sullen,

00:15:53.035 --> 00:15:56.215
quiet, depressed.

00:15:57.175 --> 00:16:02.695
Half of the life they impress other and half of the life they get depressions.

00:16:05.355 --> 00:16:10.995
Such personalities we have all around us and within us.

00:16:12.815 --> 00:16:19.775
Now how to keep in the center, is the problem nowadays because there are so many

00:16:20.615 --> 00:16:26.755
alterations to our attention all the time, you have to alter it.

00:16:27.355 --> 00:16:33.095
Today you have to, say T.V., then there's a politics going on, then this is going on, that is going on -

00:16:33.455 --> 00:16:40.355
our mind is all the time changing from one to another, skipping from one to another.

00:16:41.875 --> 00:16:45.935
We are living in a very hectic type of world

00:16:46.175 --> 00:16:50.835
where our attention is not at all steady in the center - it cannot remain.

00:16:53.015 --> 00:17:00.695
At this juncture, thank God, the modern sahaja yoga was born - I was found out.

00:17:01.815 --> 00:17:06.075
Formerly, one or two persons used to get realization -

00:17:08.215 --> 00:17:16.215
very few people used to get realization, at the beginning of the tree of life, I should say.

00:17:19.295 --> 00:17:26.695
But I thought, in those days of complete chaos

00:17:28.495 --> 00:17:33.475
and such a lot of pressures on people -

00:17:34.135 --> 00:17:38.035
they have no time to go to Himalayas and work it out.

00:17:39.995 --> 00:17:46.815
You have to have something very instant. But there was a problem with it.

00:17:48.495 --> 00:17:54.835
Supposing you try to enlighten people and they just get a wee bit,

00:17:55.935 --> 00:17:58.915
then what happens.

00:18:00.295 --> 00:18:03.595
Formerly they used to cleanse the body, everything

00:18:03.855 --> 00:18:10.015
for years together and ultimately give the realization to one person - good for nothing.

00:18:11.215 --> 00:18:18.775
Nobody understood any Incarnations, [UNCLEAR] prophets or saints because they talked of some another world.

00:18:21.015 --> 00:18:28.495
That's why they crucified Christ or gave poison to Mohammad Sahab - did all kinds of things all over the world.

00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:37.715
With sahaja yoga this mechanism is activated

00:18:38.595 --> 00:18:43.135
where you have got this Kundalini, the power,

00:18:44.315 --> 00:18:47.935
that manifests your Self-realization.

00:18:48.855 --> 00:18:54.215
She's a power, I call it She because it's the Mother's power -

00:18:54.515 --> 00:19:00.595
it is your Mother, She gives you birth so She's your Mother and She's your individual Mother.

00:19:01.095 --> 00:19:06.355
She takes all problems upon Herself. Every time I've been giving lectures, people ask,

00:19:06.535 --> 00:19:12.715
"But we have read in such and such book that Kundalini rising gives troubles." I just don't know.

00:19:13.575 --> 00:19:18.775
Either they're negative people who are trying to keep you away from reality

00:19:19.915 --> 00:19:23.695
or maybe, they don't know what Kundalini is.

00:19:26.195 --> 00:19:31.495
She is your Mother, waiting all these days, within yourself - this power -

00:19:32.635 --> 00:19:36.235
in 31/2 coils because it's some mathematics about it.

00:19:39.115 --> 00:19:47.155
And She is activated then she rises just like a primule in a seed.

00:19:48.675 --> 00:19:55.175
As soon as you put the seed in the Mother Earth and nourish it with little water,

00:19:55.835 --> 00:20:03.855
in the same way, with little love, the Divine love, She's activated and She starts rising.

00:20:06.035 --> 00:20:13.975
With your naked eyes, in some people who have obstructions, in the lower chakras you can see clearly

00:20:14.795 --> 00:20:22.075
the pulsation at the triangular bone. With your naked eyes you can see it clearly.

00:20:23.455 --> 00:20:26.635
Imagine a bone pulsating like a heart

00:20:28.775 --> 00:20:33.055
and you can see the rising and you can see it's obstruction where it stops

00:20:33.915 --> 00:20:37.815
Supposing you are a liver patient, it will go to your liver first.

00:20:39.775 --> 00:20:43.815
informing that first liver should be corrected.

00:20:46.135 --> 00:20:52.555
Or maybe if you are a great seeker, then She shoots off, comes out, out of your

00:20:53.595 --> 00:21:00.015
fontanel bone area but again She descends back to the problems where

00:21:01.135 --> 00:21:06.435
She has to attend - is a very practical thing to understand.

00:21:08.215 --> 00:21:14.295
Sahaja yoga, you cannot pay for it - is nonsense. How can you pay for anything that is living?

00:21:14.615 --> 00:21:20.395
When you pay for God or somebody says, "I'm God or this and that," you pay money. I've been telling you,

00:21:21.235 --> 00:21:29.215
I've been here four times before, every year I was telling you,"You can't pay for God, God doesn't understand money, this is your headache,

00:21:30.815 --> 00:21:34.295
why do you want to pay for anything that is living process?"

00:21:36.155 --> 00:21:41.955
But nobody liked Me at that time, to such an extent that in England they told Me

00:21:42.215 --> 00:21:45.935
that Anglo-Saxon brain cannot understand anything without money.

00:21:47.095 --> 00:21:51.335
I was surprised, who has made this brain God has made or somebody else.

00:21:54.995 --> 00:21:59.015
You cannot pay for it, that is the first criteria.

00:22:00.635 --> 00:22:04.415
It's your own right to have it, it's sahaja, born with you.

00:22:06.875 --> 00:22:14.755
And when She rises, She pierces through all these six chakras - the one chakra is below Her, which guards

00:22:15.355 --> 00:22:21.075
the movement of the Kundalini completely and rises through six chakras

00:22:21.435 --> 00:22:26.595
and pierces through the sixth chakra, giving you a cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:22:28.395 --> 00:22:34.655
Now no one knows who is the Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost is the power of God,

00:22:35.535 --> 00:22:42.735
is the desire of God and She is reflected

00:22:45.035 --> 00:22:48.555
as Kundalini in the triangular bone.

00:22:51.815 --> 00:22:59.655
That desire is the pure desire within us. All our desires are impure because they never give us satisfaction.

00:23:02.655 --> 00:23:07.115
Economic says that in general wants are not satiable.

00:23:10.275 --> 00:23:13.315
So now, we have got

00:23:18.095 --> 00:23:24.035
the knowledge about the mechanism but it must work.

00:23:24.295 --> 00:23:32.295
For example, in this hall you see beautiful lights are there and you must have put just one switch and everything must have

00:23:33.135 --> 00:23:38.615
manifested but there's a mechanism behind it, a history behind it.

00:23:39.735 --> 00:23:47.315
All these centers are the mile stones of our evolution. The last one is this,

00:23:49.555 --> 00:23:54.255
is the limbic area which is called as Sahastrara.

00:23:56.375 --> 00:24:04.395
If you cut the brain horizontally, you can see as if you have cut a lotus

00:24:06.655 --> 00:24:12.715
and the inner part is a vacuum which is the limbic area.

00:24:14.795 --> 00:24:21.875
So this Kundalini enters into the limbic area, opens from both the sides this

00:24:22.795 --> 00:24:29.995
calyx or the outside of this lotus and pierces through that.

00:24:30.475 --> 00:24:35.875
Now what is the calyx that we have formed, are two uh..

00:24:36.915 --> 00:24:42.055
balloon like growths within us - one is the ego.

00:24:44.235 --> 00:24:50.135
When we work, when we do anything, you always think we have done it.

00:24:50.555 --> 00:24:54.475
Now just see what we have done, is dead to dead.

00:24:54.755 --> 00:25:01.755
For example, from some tree they must have made this platform - which was a dead tree, made another dead thing.

00:25:04.715 --> 00:25:12.375
From something dead they have made the chairs. Now if you're sitting on the chairs, you can't sit on the ground - the chair sits on our head.

00:25:12.655 --> 00:25:17.135
Wherever you move you have to take the chair with you, otherwise you can't sit.

00:25:19.495 --> 00:25:22.895
So this matter is trying to overpower us.

00:25:25.255 --> 00:25:29.895
That's all. This is the ego that builds within us.

00:25:30.815 --> 00:25:36.155
We have done nothing but just change forms from dead to dead.

00:25:36.995 --> 00:25:40.135
Here I'm talking about transforming

00:25:42.575 --> 00:25:50.455
uh.. human-being into a new human-being, into a human-being where there is spiritual light.

00:25:51.315 --> 00:25:58.535
In Sanskrit language, a person who is a realized soul as called as 'dwijah' - means born twice

00:26:00.255 --> 00:26:04.915
and also a bird is called as a 'dwijah' meaning the bird

00:26:05.595 --> 00:26:10.095
also comes as an egg and then becomes the bird.

00:26:11.635 --> 00:26:17.895
In the same way we get a transformation and that transformation

00:26:18.755 --> 00:26:25.535
brings us to a position where we are in Absolute status,

00:26:26.355 --> 00:26:34.295
in Absolute condition. When the Kundalini passes through Agnya chakra - here, this one, the center of Christ

00:26:35.955 --> 00:26:42.315
- She pushes down both these ego and superego, which you see the two balloon like structures.

00:26:43.535 --> 00:26:51.415
As a result of that we get a soft bone opened up again, as you had in your childhood

00:26:53.355 --> 00:26:59.915
and you feel thoughtless, there's no thought. If you want to think, you can think

00:27:00.175 --> 00:27:06.695
but no body is going on inside all the time - you feel the peace within yourself.

00:27:07.515 --> 00:27:13.675
And when She pierces through completely then you feel the cool breeze coming out of your head

00:27:14.155 --> 00:27:19.935
and also if your this center is all right, you can feel the cool breeze around.

00:27:24.355 --> 00:27:31.335
As a result of that the centers which are like this, we can say, the centers

00:27:31.595 --> 00:27:37.415
which have moved because of our left and right movement on the sides and have broken

00:27:37.775 --> 00:27:45.815
the connection with the whole, again go back to their original positions and they get nourished

00:27:46.595 --> 00:27:50.435
and the energy that was exhausted in them starts flowing.

00:27:50.895 --> 00:27:57.255
That's how our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being is corrected.

00:28:00.575 --> 00:28:07.015
Most of the diseases can be cured with this Kundalini awakening but I'm not curing you,

00:28:08.335 --> 00:28:16.255
you are curing yourself. Only thing is your medicine lies within you which has to rise and give you this. This is all yours

00:28:18.515 --> 00:28:26.295
for which why should you pay anyone, why should you feel obliged - I'm just a catalyst.

00:28:27.795 --> 00:28:35.075
If this happens to you, is a very great thing because then your hands will speak -

00:28:35.295 --> 00:28:40.835
as Mohammad sahab has said that, "At the time of resurrection your hands will speak."

00:28:41.635 --> 00:28:48.415
Hands start speaking means what, that on your finger-tips you can feel the seven centers

00:28:49.035 --> 00:28:54.135
and you can see in another person what's wrong with the other person, what's wrong with your self.

00:28:54.815 --> 00:29:02.735
Now only if you know what is the decoding is and how to cure a particular center

00:29:03.115 --> 00:29:07.455
finished - don't have to do anything else but this much.

00:29:09.955 --> 00:29:17.895
Of course in some people who are mentally, physically, emotionally, specially spiritually are sick,

00:29:18.855 --> 00:29:22.335
it takes little time to settle down.

00:29:23.055 --> 00:29:29.575
Though you might get your realization today but the Kundalini has to be brought back and to be settled there.

00:29:30.495 --> 00:29:38.495
Like, like a little sapling you have to look after it in the beginning and then you absolutely become the master.

00:29:41.355 --> 00:29:45.215
I've seen people who had their realization as late as

00:29:45.615 --> 00:29:51.955
'84 or '85, are today great masters of sahaja yoga.

00:29:54.895 --> 00:30:02.155
It's very surprising. Now these masters of sahaja yoga don't stand on their heads,

00:30:02.895 --> 00:30:10.875
don't do abnormal things, they don't have to do much jogging or anything - your body comes to that position what you need.

00:30:12.755 --> 00:30:20.055
For example, somebody needs more water so it's all right, somebody doesn't need  more water, it's all right but certain,

00:30:20.975 --> 00:30:27.155
certain kind of uh.. exercises which are needed to improve the condition

00:30:27.415 --> 00:30:30.395
of the particular chakras can be done.

00:30:31.475 --> 00:30:38.855
But the main thing is to keep the Kundalini here so that the Spirit which is in your heart -

00:30:39.275 --> 00:30:44.155
has a seat here - is all the time kept enlightened.

00:30:46.735 --> 00:30:51.975
That's the main job. Now the biggest problem I face today is this,

00:30:53.495 --> 00:31:00.335
that in India people are quite capable to know who is a real master who is not.

00:31:01.435 --> 00:31:06.315
Thank God we are not so rich to throw our money for realization.

00:31:07.955 --> 00:31:15.675
So, we don't have these false gurus there. They all come to Australia or to America - wherever there is money they're coming down.

00:31:18.415 --> 00:31:25.995
But the main problem - I don't mind there are lots of thugs in this world, you see, smugglers are there, it's all right

00:31:26.875 --> 00:31:34.935
and there are many people who are cheated, it's all right - but the main thing is they attack the Kundalini,

00:31:36.755 --> 00:31:44.295
they attack the central path. I've known many people getting cancer

00:31:44.855 --> 00:31:49.715
because they have been to some gurus because it is a psychosomatic thing, even AIDS

00:31:51.295 --> 00:31:54.075
uh..could be due to certain things

00:31:54.335 --> 00:32:00.075
I had cured one fellow who was doing TM, I'd cured him completely.

00:32:00.355 --> 00:32:07.295
Doctors said that he's completely cured of AIDS but again he started uh..going to some TM fellow, again he got it

00:32:07.575 --> 00:32:14.495
and he died - it was in Australia. Then I gave it up because you get frustrated with such people.

00:32:15.695 --> 00:32:20.955
When I told him not to go to that person, particular person, then again he went down to that person

00:32:22.435 --> 00:32:28.855
because these people are using all these false gurus, are using some sort of spirits

00:32:30.255 --> 00:32:36.855
to keep you bound to them so that all that you have your money, your properties, everything they get.

00:32:37.035 --> 00:32:42.615
Their main purpose, the honesty of purpose is that they want money - that's all.

00:32:43.255 --> 00:32:48.475
Money they can have but money they can't have unless they mesmerize you

00:32:49.335 --> 00:32:52.575
or involve you into something nonsensical.

00:32:55.575 --> 00:33:02.175
I've seen people getting into trouble, very much, if they have had wrong gurus

00:33:03.795 --> 00:33:10.215
and I'm surprised. These gurus have given them nothing, they have taken all their money,

00:33:10.495 --> 00:33:17.335
they have taken all their wisdom, they have lost their jobs but still they are sticking on  to them like leeches.

00:33:21.615 --> 00:33:29.275
In London we have people from TM itself, I would say - there are people in London who are recluses, absolutely.

00:33:31.015 --> 00:33:37.015
They're suffering from some sort of a secret disease they can't explain. Some of the politicians are suffering

00:33:37.295 --> 00:33:44.295
but still they going on and on and on and I've been telling openly about it, nobody listens to Me.

00:33:45.055 --> 00:33:50.595
It happened when I told them in '83 or '84

00:33:51.495 --> 00:33:55.895
that this disease is going to come to America - they didn't listen to Me.

00:33:56.575 --> 00:34:04.015
I told on the television from Santiago, from Los Angeles, from San Francisco, from New York

00:34:05.955 --> 00:34:10.815
but nobody bothered about it and today when I go there they all say, "Mother, we are in it."

00:34:11.435 --> 00:34:18.175
And you get disgusted with them because they are so much now weak that they cannot get over

00:34:19.015 --> 00:34:22.055
all those attachments they have had.

00:34:23.855 --> 00:34:27.675
It's the attack of the negative.

00:34:29.275 --> 00:34:36.155
Tremendous negativity is working out that you don't get your realization,

00:34:36.575 --> 00:34:41.435
that you don't achieve your highest.

00:34:42.615 --> 00:34:50.135
So much of negativity everywhere I find and I just don't know how I am going to help all of you.

00:34:51.755 --> 00:34:57.995
First of all you must understand that all these wrong things have rendered nothing to you and nothing to anybody else.

00:35:00.115 --> 00:35:06.875
So many cases of cancer have been cured by sahaja yoga - we're making now a big file out of it.

00:35:07.575 --> 00:35:13.675
Recently, the Delhi University has given us a

00:35:14.055 --> 00:35:21.055
PhD. for doctors for research in sahaja yoga, even Cambridge may do it.

00:35:21.835 --> 00:35:26.715
There are so many doctors busy to find out how sahaja yoga has cured

00:35:26.975 --> 00:35:31.075
so many types of cancers,  livers, diabetes.

00:35:33.415 --> 00:35:39.375
Already papers have been published about how the physical health

00:35:39.655 --> 00:35:42.675
of the people has improved by doing sahaja yoga.

00:35:45.835 --> 00:35:51.935
Blood pressures, tensions all these things managed.

00:35:53.415 --> 00:36:00.415
These sahaja yogies don't lead an abnormal life. They wear normal dresses, they live like normal, decent,

00:36:00.935 --> 00:36:08.675
of course decent people, not like cutting this part of the hair, that part of the hair, then putting tar on your head.

00:36:10.415 --> 00:36:13.755
The other day I said, "We are not hippopotamus to do all these things, you see."

00:36:14.195 --> 00:36:20.655
All sorts of abnormal things they give up. They become sensible, serene, good citizens.

00:36:21.735 --> 00:36:27.115
They have good wives. We had 71 marriages this year.

00:36:27.355 --> 00:36:33.875
and you'll be happy to know that all of them are very successful and they have very great children born to them.

00:36:35.075 --> 00:36:41.715
Children won't be born to people who are all the time fighting among themselves, wasting their life.

00:36:42.775 --> 00:36:48.695
Only bad people will be born to them who can bear all that but good children are born to sahaja yogies.

00:36:49.435 --> 00:36:55.975
I'm so happy to see, in Melbourne, we had a very good report from the government

00:36:56.215 --> 00:37:00.035
for our schools that whatever they proclaim, that they are.

00:37:00.955 --> 00:37:06.795
How many schools can do that, though it's rather difficult here to run private schools.

00:37:08.575 --> 00:37:15.315
In all fields sahaja yoga is showing good results because once a person is transformed

00:37:15.795 --> 00:37:22.115
most of your problems will drop out - you are such a satisfied person you will not be a dishonest politician,

00:37:23.735 --> 00:37:31.455
you'll not be a dishonest preacher, you'll not be a bad father, bad mother

00:37:32.115 --> 00:37:38.075
and not arrogant children. A beautiful society is established now -

00:37:39.455 --> 00:37:43.575
in Sydney we lots of people, in Melbourne also.

00:37:45.235 --> 00:37:53.195
Only thing is you have to come in the center and to come in the center you have to have your Kundalini awakened, free of cost.

00:37:55.395 --> 00:38:01.695
It sounds fantastic, it sounds out of the blue normally

00:38:02.135 --> 00:38:10.135
but it's nothing so fantastic. Say for example, now you have got a T.V. here but in Indian villages they have not seen the T.V.

00:38:11.615 --> 00:38:16.495
Now if you take the T.V. there and say, "You can see everything whatever is happening in the whole world."

00:38:16.895 --> 00:38:24.455
They will say, "Ah! What are you telling us stories, how can it be?" Then you put it to the mains and it works.

00:38:25.715 --> 00:38:32.595
In the same way you are made beautifully within yourselves. Human-beings are the greatest computers,

00:38:34.475 --> 00:38:39.315
the greatest knowledgeable things - the whole knowledge rests within them.

00:38:40.175 --> 00:38:47.535
All that is within has come out and has become the so-called knowledge but they become the knowers.

00:38:50.415 --> 00:38:56.855
And when it happens, suddenly you find dynamic things happening.

00:38:57.795 --> 00:39:03.135
We had a boy in Portugal who was doing little pottery work.

00:39:04.155 --> 00:39:09.415
He came to sahaja yoga, today he is a very big potter earning lots of money.

00:39:10.055 --> 00:39:17.995
We had some people who used to just paint ordinarily - they have become very great painters and earning quite a lot, in your country.

00:39:20.015 --> 00:39:25.295
You just become dynamic and things work out in every way possible.

00:39:26.375 --> 00:39:32.275
In this short time, whatever is possible for the introduction I have told you but tomorrow in details I'll tell you

00:39:32.615 --> 00:39:37.995
all that can work out with sahaja yoga. May God bless you all!

00:39:43.235 --> 00:39:48.875
Today being the first day, I: would like to give some time for questioning.

00:39:55.095 --> 00:40:00.595
But ask sensible questions, I'm not seeking votes nor I'm going for an election.

00:40:01.315 --> 00:40:07.215
Here I am to give you what you have, so don't ask questions which are aggressive.

00:40:07.575 --> 00:40:13.395
Or if you belong to some group - like the other day we had somebody from 'Born Again' or something -

00:40:13.655 --> 00:40:19.495
they're already having trouble and he came to hit Me and all that; So that sort of a thing is not needed.

- Somebody has to come [UNCLEAR]

00:40:47.815 --> 00:40:52.575
- No question?
- Yes, one question Mother. Are you a guru or do you have a guru?

00:40:53.495 --> 00:40:58.315
No, I had no guru and I'm a Mother, I'm not a guru.

00:40:59.135 --> 00:41:05.575
See guru is, of course in a way Mother is a guru all the time - she's a teacher all the time - no?

00:41:05.795 --> 00:41:12.455
But there's a big difference between a real guru and a mother. See, real guru in India

00:41:14.375 --> 00:41:19.055
will give you a real hard time - never go near them.

00:41:23.095 --> 00:41:31.315
One fellow who came all the way from Himalayas, he told Me, "My guru has come here and he wants to come and meet You."

00:41:32.475 --> 00:41:36.815
They also regard Me as their Mother and they also respect Me.

00:41:38.255 --> 00:41:43.615
So I said, "All right, I'll go and see him now." So went there.

00:41:44.835 --> 00:41:51.375
So on the way he said, "Today, my guru hanged me uh.. by a rope

00:41:51.655 --> 00:41:57.135
upside down in a well and kept me hanging there for six hours

00:41:57.635 --> 00:42:01.695
and he used to dip me every time, every hour and

00:42:02.435 --> 00:42:10.095
then he brought me up and said, 'Now you go and call Mataji.'" I said, "What's that, it's terrible! I mean, why is he so cruel?"

00:42:10.895 --> 00:42:17.035
So I asked his guru, I said, "What do you mean by treating him like this, you have no business? Why do you treat him, he's a seeker?"

00:42:17.395 --> 00:42:21.375
He said, "Do you know he was smoking?

00:42:21.835 --> 00:42:27.395
Smoking he's doing at this time, what will happen to him, why should I give him realization?"

00:42:29.095 --> 00:42:35.655
So I said, "What's the problem with his realization?" So he went inside. The guru just got angry, went inside.

00:42:36.195 --> 00:42:43.915
I said, "What's the matter with you?" He said, "My Agnya chakra is catching and my guru says that, "Nobody opened mu Agnya chakra for ten years

00:42:44.135 --> 00:42:51.575
and I'm not going to open your Agnya chakra." I said, "Why? Just come here." One minute I opened his Agnya chakra - he got his realization.

00:42:52.475 --> 00:43:00.395
So he came out, the guru. He said, "That's Mother! That's not a guru, that's a Mother. She can do it, not me. Who opened my Agnya chakra?"

00:43:00.875 --> 00:43:04.875
Like that, you see - they're terrible, they take you to task.

00:43:05.635 --> 00:43:12.515
So don't go near a real guru - they will not take any money or anything but take you to task.

00:43:13.115 --> 00:43:20.475
It's better take your sahaja yoga and become yourself a guru of your own. And no use asking questions about Me. It doesn't,

00:43:21.395 --> 00:43:29.515
doesn't help much - better know yourself. I'm here for you to know yourself. You know yourself, then you'll know Me better, isn't it?

- Sometimes..
- It's very hard to be stop, to stop being sad.
- Sad?

00:43:54.135 --> 00:43:57.835
Because you are very left sided, that's why you are sad.

00:43:58.455 --> 00:44:02.775
If I bring you in the center, you'll be joy and a source of joy too.

00:44:07.335 --> 00:44:14.175
Something gone wrong with the machine, you see. Supposing something goes wrong with this machine, it will make funny noises.

00:44:14.495 --> 00:44:19.635
Supposing I'm an expert mechanic, I can correct it then it's flowing all right.

00:44:29.295 --> 00:44:36.175
- Mother, I want to ask a question.
- Please get up, please and we can't hear you, sir.

00:44:37.175 --> 00:44:43.775
- Yes please, sir.

- [INAUDIBLE N UNCLEAR]
- Hmm?

00:45:00.635 --> 00:45:05.475
- Right. You have talked to us about the curing of diseases
- Hmm

00:45:05.855 --> 00:45:12.235
Uh..You have not mentioned so much about the prevention of diseases or the causes of them.

00:45:12.955 --> 00:45:19.955
You see, you don't get diseases at all after realization so there's no need to work out much of prevention.

00:45:20.675 --> 00:45:24.635
After realization you don't pay any bills to the doctor.

00:45:25.715 --> 00:45:31.335
So the preventions are not needed but in certain things, like say, supposing somebody's a liver patient -

00:45:31.755 --> 00:45:39.515
now in sahaja yoga we have two types of livers. Say we have one liver which is a lethargic liver and another one which is a

00:45:40.015 --> 00:45:44.595
active liver, supposing somebody has. Then we tell them

00:45:44.835 --> 00:45:51.015
as to the change of diet for sometime, for both the things - different diets they have, just the opposite.

00:45:51.615 --> 00:45:57.575
And once they come to normal conditions then they have to give up their dieting - then they are all right.

00:45:57.955 --> 00:46:03.435
So the prevention is not much needed because you become such a different person

00:46:03.855 --> 00:46:09.155
that you're not tempted to do something that is not good, normally and

00:46:09.415 --> 00:46:16.195
I don't think sahaja yogies normally get sick except for some adamant one. The other one we had one here

00:46:16.455 --> 00:46:21.335
in Adelaide. I think he was a boy, a very nasty type of a boy

00:46:21.575 --> 00:46:29.635
and he was keeping three dogs and he put his tongue into their mouths, just like a very horrid, satanic type, you see.

00:46:29.935 --> 00:46:37.815
He would not listen to us, he was just trying to trouble us and then he got some troubles because he used to jump with them and do all kinds of things.

00:46:38.235 --> 00:46:45.115
And then he got some sort of a trouble - we can't help it because he never listened to us and he troubled us a lot.

00:46:47.075 --> 00:46:54.255
So precautions are, like say, some ladies say are very dominating

00:46:54.615 --> 00:47:01.155
to their husbands, say, or a husband is very dominating to the wife - that also causes problems.

00:47:02.195 --> 00:47:09.435
But gradually they become very sensible and understand their role as husband and wife.

00:47:09.935 --> 00:47:16.755
So the problem disappears - can be very serious problems. If the husband is very dominating or say,

00:47:16.975 --> 00:47:24.435
he's a flirtish type of a man or he goes about with other women or he keeps the woman in a very umm.

00:47:25.355 --> 00:47:32.635
say, in a suspense all the time or in jealousies and things like that,

00:47:32.895 --> 00:47:40.255
then she can develop a cancer of the breast. For that we cannot cure the husband

00:47:40.535 --> 00:47:48.535
because if the husband is not in sahaja yoga what to do. So we make the woman so strong - she, she doesn't feel anything about it, she doesn't bother herself.

00:47:48.835 --> 00:47:56.095
Like that. You become, you see, you, you do not have reactionary nature - you become yourself something

00:47:56.315 --> 00:48:02.775
You're not, no more a reactionary. So there is not too much prevention needed because you're so strong,

00:48:03.035 --> 00:48:09.435
you don't need much prevention but if it is needed, we tell them. For example, now,

00:48:10.375 --> 00:48:18.375
somebody's smoking too much in the room, smoking room or something, there of course we feel that we should at least cover our

00:48:18.595 --> 00:48:24.095
face with something to get the smoke in because they become sensitive also to all these things.

00:48:25.795 --> 00:48:31.935
But not too much of preventions because you become very different. Your temptations

00:48:32.855 --> 00:48:37.895
are different and you just don't worry about all these things which ruin you.

00:48:38.215 --> 00:48:44.475
Now you jump, say, two belts are going, I always feel like that - one going towards destruction, one towards construction.

00:48:44.675 --> 00:48:49.135
You jump from this to the construction side so gradually you move towards construction.

00:48:55.555 --> 00:49:03.055
- Yes please, yes.
- [INAUDIBLE] and secondly

00:49:03.295 --> 00:49:10.295
- [INAUDIBLE]
- Two questions - how should we meditate

00:49:10.535 --> 00:49:15.855
and second question, is the Grace of God needed for realization?

00:49:16.115 --> 00:49:19.835
- Is the Grace of God
- needed for realization
- Of course!

00:49:21.195 --> 00:49:25.515
Without God how can you work out? It's all His work.

00:49:26.915 --> 00:49:32.175
And, but you see, if you take the name of God, half people will run away.

00:49:34.095 --> 00:49:41.675
People don't like that name these days - it's very bad. The One who is our Creator, the One who loves us so much -

00:49:42.315 --> 00:49:49.195
you don't know Him that's why. When you know Him, you'll know how far away we are away from Him.

00:49:49.835 --> 00:49:56.635
That's why I take the name of Divine or Divinity because caution. As he said we should take precautions

00:49:56.975 --> 00:50:04.975
that's why I take precaution not to say. And how to meditate, that I'll tell you little later, all right - that's very good question.

00:50:07.095 --> 00:50:10.175
Is God and God, nothing else.

00:50:21.735 --> 00:50:29.715
- Yes please. Will you get up please?
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:29.955 --> 00:50:38.055
[INAUDIBLE]

00:50:38.395 --> 00:50:44.515
I'll explain. If you're too far to the left or to the right

00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:49.275
how can you bring yourself to the center without any help?

00:50:49.395 --> 00:50:55.915
We, that is the thing you have to learn a little bit, that's all. That's something you have to learn and that I'll tell you

00:50:56.115 --> 00:50:59.535
how to do it, all right. Now what else?

00:51:04.575 --> 00:51:12.255
- [UNCLEAR]

00:51:13.695 --> 00:51:17.095
[INAUDIBLE]

00:51:17.715 --> 00:51:24.555
I'm sorry sir [UNCLEAR]. Uh..Could you please repeat it again - that the young people and TM

00:51:24.775 --> 00:51:27.815
[INAUDIBLE]

00:51:29.235 --> 00:51:33.935
- [UNCLEAR] I was talking about TM and [UNCLEAR]
- Ah.. money, sorry

00:51:34.155 --> 00:51:38.335
- but I was wondering if the technique [UNCLEAR]

00:51:38.575 --> 00:51:43.075
- Ah.. You talked about TM
- Yes, yes
- they are taking away the money

00:51:43.295 --> 00:51:47.435
- Annh..
- Is the technique bad or what is [UNCLEAR]

00:51:47.715 --> 00:51:54.215
Technique is bad and money is bad and I'm warning you against it, again and again - be careful about it.

00:51:55.175 --> 00:52:02.775
You'll end up as recluses, you'll be end up with, with some epilepsy, you'll end up with some troubles - I'm warning you before all of you.

00:52:03.955 --> 00:52:08.255
And if they want they can prosecute Me for that - I can prove it.

00:52:13.015 --> 00:52:20.955
- Yes
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:21.935 --> 00:52:24.975
- What?
- You have said that we are the Spirit
- hmm.

00:52:25.215 --> 00:52:30.895
- Is this the re-incarnated Spirit?
- No, no, no. You see, when I say you are the Spirit,

00:52:31.935 --> 00:52:38.195
the Spirit is the One that resides in your heart which is the reflection of God Almighty - all right?

00:52:38.735 --> 00:52:45.975
Now, that is the One who witnesses us, sees us - He's not in our attention, is not in our attention.

00:52:47.835 --> 00:52:54.715
But when we become the Spirit, He comes in our attention

00:52:55.675 --> 00:53:02.575
and then what happens, that our attention gets enlightened in the sense that sitting here you can

00:53:02.995 --> 00:53:08.475
feel about anyone, what's wrong with this. Like the gentleman asked about TM

00:53:09.395 --> 00:53:12.735
Now, he doesn't know whether it is good or bad

00:53:13.935 --> 00:53:21.135
but if he gets realized immediately he will know how horrible it is because he'll start getting blisters on his fingers.

00:53:35.075 --> 00:53:42.235
[UNCLEAR]

00:53:42.555 --> 00:53:48.455
[UNCLEAR]

00:53:48.715 --> 00:53:55.335
Do the herbicides and pesticides and other such chemicals, do they destroy our body?

00:53:56.455 --> 00:54:01.535
- Which, which?
- The herbicides, the pesticides that are used in growing of food

00:54:01.755 --> 00:54:07.135
Yes they, you see, but so, that is true, they do. Now say,

00:54:07.555 --> 00:54:14.315
for example, I would say the way we use these uh.. medicines and

00:54:14.515 --> 00:54:20.115
pesticides and all those things, they definitely are very strong - no doubt about it

00:54:20.635 --> 00:54:27.635
but once you are a realized soul, you can fight them - not so difficult. I would say now, hybrid food itself, you see,

00:54:27.875 --> 00:54:35.295
is a very, I don't think is a very good thing to have. Now how we get rid of these pesticides

00:54:35.615 --> 00:54:40.595
and these things is very simple in India. We have experimented with us, with it

00:54:40.875 --> 00:54:46.855
and what we have found out very nicely is this, that the

00:54:50.095 --> 00:54:57.615
when you use your vibrations or you use the vibrated water then

00:54:57.995 --> 00:55:05.035
if you use it on the non-hybrid seeds, which, which cannot germinate much, then what happens

00:55:06.395 --> 00:55:12.015
that, that those things which are non-hybrid

00:55:12.315 --> 00:55:15.355
produce better results than the hybrid.

00:55:17.015 --> 00:55:23.255
Now, if you are a realized soul, all right, you use vibrated water or if you go round your

00:55:23.635 --> 00:55:28.535
uh.. fields, you don't need pesticides - pests will go away.

00:55:31.935 --> 00:55:39.635
They just disappear because they understand vibrations. Animals understands vibrations much more than human-beings.

00:55:40.275 --> 00:55:45.715
Pests, everything that you use for, they just disappear - they don't want to be there.

00:55:49.095 --> 00:55:55.095
So don't use them and then there is no problem of this remains but many people have to get it.

00:55:55.395 --> 00:56:02.395
But otherwise also when you are sort of a realized soul, then you're quite strong enough to bear lots of things.

00:56:03.675 --> 00:56:09.055
You don't get sick very easily unless and until you do something deliberately.

00:56:11.275 --> 00:56:19.315
[INAUDIBLE N UNCLEAR]

00:56:19.615 --> 00:56:27.715
[UNCLEAR]

00:56:28.535 --> 00:56:35.595
- What she's saying?
- That the food we eat in any case, what we buy that has been poisoned with all these

00:56:35.855 --> 00:56:40.275
- things today.
- Achcha
- So does it damage us even if we're realized?

00:56:40.635 --> 00:56:48.395
No, then it does not. If you're realized, then it does not. But so much attention is paid to food in these countries, everybody. I don't think it's

00:56:48.615 --> 00:56:52.275
so much of a problem that people are talking about.

00:56:52.515 --> 00:56:59.775
But once you're realized, you're not damaged by anything, anything - it's all these things are very ordinary.

00:57:00.655 --> 00:57:07.175
There are greater things to fight in this world. Yes, yes madam.

00:57:08.835 --> 00:57:14.815
Mother, [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:16.115 --> 00:57:24.095
- How do we become realized? Is it just..
- Haan, that's the thing, that's the thing I'm going to do now. That's good question, that's the thing.

00:57:27.495 --> 00:57:34.695
-Yes madam.
- [INAUDIBLE]
- Karma?

00:57:35.375 --> 00:57:40.695
- Does sahaja yoga affect karma?
- It just sucks your karmas.

00:57:41.575 --> 00:57:47.735
Karmas are all sucked in. See, what are your karmas come into your pouch of your ego

00:57:47.995 --> 00:57:54.995
and once the Kundalini rises, She sucks in. Now what is karmas left now because Christ is here, say.

00:57:55.595 --> 00:58:02.335
I say Christ is here - you take it as a hypothesis. You need not accept Me but is a fact which you can find out later on.

00:58:02.635 --> 00:58:07.275
Now the Christ is here. We say Christ died for our sins, don't we say?

00:58:08.535 --> 00:58:16.495
He died for our sins. If you awaken Christ within your Agnya Chakra, He sucks in all your sins - that's what He does.

00:58:18.355 --> 00:58:23.755
But it's an absurd ideas we have about Christianity also that we must

00:58:23.995 --> 00:58:29.735
suffer, our body must suffer. Why, He has suffered for us, are you going to suffer more than Him?

00:58:32.955 --> 00:58:35.955
How much He has suffered!

00:58:37.735 --> 00:58:43.035
So all the karmas and all that are sucked in -  there are no, you go into akarmas.

00:58:44.415 --> 00:58:50.075
You're no more there to be the karmas - you're the Spirit now.

00:58:52.535 --> 00:58:55.555
All right?

00:59:03.295 --> 00:59:09.935
- Tumko sunai de raha hai? [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]. I can't hear a word. [UNCLEAR] A little loudly, sir.

- [INAUDIBLE]
- No, I think you are finally discommitted to
- Kya bol raha hai?

00:59:59.015 --> 01:00:06.855
- He's saying that You talked about evolution
- Haan
- and yet about the model

01:00:07.075 --> 01:00:14.135
what it is just now - do you need to change your system to fit into that aspect of evolution? That's what I could make out.

01:00:14.355 --> 01:00:20.215
It's rather a confused question, sir. Will you, if you sit down, I'll explain to you.

01:00:29.235 --> 01:00:37.235
We have evolved up to human level or say human awareness, right? Our nerves have got a certain

01:00:37.695 --> 01:00:42.975
dimension of awareness now but we have not reached

01:00:45.495 --> 01:00:52.875
our destination. And the destination is that we have to become the Spirit.

01:00:53.455 --> 01:00:57.395
This is the last breakthrough that has to take place.

01:00:58.935 --> 01:01:02.015
And the whole system works it out.

01:01:03.495 --> 01:01:10.055
As I explained to you in an egg,

01:01:13.135 --> 01:01:19.135
the whole egg system works it out and a bird comes out of it.

01:01:20.315 --> 01:01:24.555
In the same way this transformation takes place within us.

01:01:27.495 --> 01:01:34.495
But you don't feel any working - it's such a slick system; You don't feel anything about it. It's a very beautiful system.

01:01:35.175 --> 01:01:40.755
You just feel the cool breeze coming out of your head and you feel the cool breeze all around.

01:01:41.835 --> 01:01:47.755
It's a beautiful system, beautifully made. Even there, Hume has made a mistake, I think,

01:01:48.035 --> 01:01:53.875
that he didn't understand that Subconscious and Collective Subconscious all these lie on the left-hand side

01:01:54.095 --> 01:01:59.695
and the Supraconscious and the Collective  Supraconscious lie on the right hand side and there's a path in between.

01:02:00.095 --> 01:02:06.075
He just completely mixed up that point otherwise he was quite there.

01:02:06.875 --> 01:02:10.075
Yes, is there any question?

01:02:12.815 --> 01:02:20.655
[INAUDIBLE]

- If a person had a choice
- Haan
- of taking a path which they believe is beneficial to them

01:02:34.475 --> 01:02:38.475
but they think that that could hurt people who love them

01:02:38.735 --> 01:02:45.315
Oh, they should take it. You see you must know one thing, we cannot force it on you at all, never.

01:02:46.595 --> 01:02:54.415
It has to be asked for. It's a, you see one thing, you cannot force this. God is not going to fall at your feet - no, no.

01:02:55.195 --> 01:02:59.635
It's your gain, if you want to have, have it otherwise nothing.

01:02:59.875 --> 01:03:06.295
Nobody is going to force you, nothing. You have to have complete freedom because if you have to rise to the

01:03:07.435 --> 01:03:15.015
entire field of freedom, then you must have your freedom - that's why God gave freedom to human-beings.

[INAUDIBLE]

01:05:00.935 --> 01:05:06.615
- How do the gurus, false gurus
- Hnnh
- uh..manage  to control people

01:05:06.855 --> 01:05:11.375
because if their own chakras are spoilt, how do they still have the power to do so?

01:05:12.595 --> 01:05:20.495
You see they don't, you cannot control people through your chakras, you can never control - actually you never try to control anyone.

01:05:21.575 --> 01:05:27.535
You enjoy the freedom of another person so if their chakras are spoilt,

01:05:30.035 --> 01:05:36.395
what they do is to,  first of all entice people with big, big advertisements

01:05:37.995 --> 01:05:42.515
and wrong ideas, talking bombastically about things

01:05:43.395 --> 01:05:51.095
and also they have another way of mesmerism - they mesmerize people. There're lots of things they do with the dead.

01:05:51.435 --> 01:05:55.915
Also they practice all kinds of hypnotism

01:05:56.435 --> 01:06:01.175
uh.. which I have noticed, people are so much enticed, they cannot get over it.

01:06:01.515 --> 01:06:04.715
And they try all kinds of dirty tricks.

01:06:06.155 --> 01:06:12.515
Many things they do and, I think, they hit upon the weaknesses of people also.

01:06:13.255 --> 01:06:17.735
Like a guru who is a real guru, will never meet you in privacy

01:06:18.895 --> 01:06:24.535
but this false one meet you in the privacy and sort of they'll ask you questions in such a manner

01:06:24.815 --> 01:06:30.295
that you might give away some of your secrets or something. They also blackmail you.

01:06:30.715 --> 01:06:37.095
There don't know how they work it out but definitely, they definitely mesmerize you.

01:06:37.455 --> 01:06:43.015
Also they spoil your chakras uh.. by turning them the other way round.

01:06:44.095 --> 01:06:51.335
Now this chakra, if somebody turns it the other way round, we can see some sort of a light or a spark coming out of it

01:06:51.735 --> 01:06:55.275
and you can get completely uh...

01:06:56.335 --> 01:07:04.195
uh.. enticed by that, completely - you can become a slave of that person, if this chakra is handled the other way round.

01:07:07.235 --> 01:07:14.395
So, they also know so many ways; This is called as 'Kali Vidya' in India - that they try all these tricks.

01:07:19.355 --> 01:07:26.555
- [INAUDIBLE]
- Is that sort of a thing happening in Australia?

01:07:27.035 --> 01:07:33.295
Yes, I think many people are enticed, have been enticed. Now they have got out of it but still

01:07:33.655 --> 01:07:41.435
because, you see, this is money orientation - they want to make money out of you so they'll tell you some sort of a mantra, imagine?

01:07:41.835 --> 01:07:48.195
Uh.. some people had a mantra called as 'Inga', some had as a 'Thinga'.

01:07:48.475 --> 01:07:54.915
Now 'Inga' means the tail of a, tail, in, in ordinary language, not in Sanskrit -

01:07:55.155 --> 01:08:00.135
Inga means the tail of a scorpion - imagine, what a mantra!

01:08:01.395 --> 01:08:07.695
Or 'Thinga' means when you show like this to somebody to put him down - Thinga.

01:08:07.935 --> 01:08:13.095
And they were told never to tell anybody, this is very secret, this is coming from Himalayas, somebody's

01:08:13.295 --> 01:08:19.295
- all sorts of things, you know, and poor naive people from Australia don't know anything about it.

01:08:19.515 --> 01:08:25.895
If they tell to Indian, he will laugh and laugh and laugh and jump with laughing - they have be-fooled people like this.

01:08:27.695 --> 01:08:35.575
And they make a big ritual about it that you go with this thing, that thing, put so much money here, there and then you get this thing.

01:08:35.855 --> 01:08:40.155
Seven doors you have to cross to meet the guru, make a big ado out of him

01:08:42.975 --> 01:08:47.455
and you're enamored. They'll keep Rolls Royces.

01:08:48.155 --> 01:08:56.095
I went to Boston and when I wanted to go to their television, they asked Me, "How many Rolls Royces you have?" I said, "I have none."

01:08:57.215 --> 01:09:03.935
They said, "We are not interested, if you have no Rolls Royces, we are not interested." Just imagine!

01:09:04.695 --> 01:09:11.495
It plays, you see, you get the gurus the kind you like, the way you want - isn't it? I should say like that.

01:09:11.755 --> 01:09:17.895
You should ask for real gurus, real masters, the ones who will make you meet God.

01:09:18.275 --> 01:09:21.935
Nanak Sahab has said, "Guru wahi jo Sahib milihe."

01:09:22.175 --> 01:09:27.575
The guru is the one who makes you meet the God Almighty - Sahib.

01:09:31.755 --> 01:09:37.895
Everybody has said this but the trouble is we do not want to take to somebody who is simple.

01:09:42.355 --> 01:09:46.435
This modern types, you see, having horns

01:09:47.695 --> 01:09:54.095
and all kinds of horrible things - that attracts people.

01:09:57.615 --> 01:10:02.275
What am I to do? I mean, I just don't know how this psychology has come.

01:10:08.915 --> 01:10:11.895
Are you sad still?

01:10:13.235 --> 01:10:17.455
- [UNCLEAR] not now.
- Now, that's better. [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

01:10:17.675 --> 01:10:25.655
[UNCLEAR] inside them then there should be no evil.

01:10:25.915 --> 01:10:34.015
- There's no?
- If everybody has [UNCLEAR] inside them there should be no evil.

01:10:34.855 --> 01:10:37.895
Yes, the evil has to run away.

01:10:38.435 --> 01:10:42.235
- [INAUDIBLE]
- Then we shouldn't worry about them.

01:10:42.715 --> 01:10:47.155
[LAUGHTER] Some will remain evil, so it's all right.

01:10:47.335 --> 01:10:54.515
There isn't, you see, there isn't place in the Kingdom of God for everyone, I must say - evil will not go there.

01:10:55.795 --> 01:10:59.555
You see, it's all full now - the seats - you should say.

01:10:59.775 --> 01:11:04.135
Let them go to Hell, do what they like but they will be very few.

01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:13.275
I see there are so many seekers, such beautiful souls in this world, though misguided but there are good people, very many.

01:11:14.175 --> 01:11:20.095
So many good people could never have existed on this earth, I think -

01:11:20.715 --> 01:11:26.775
but they're misguided, that's all. Yes please.

01:11:27.495 --> 01:11:34.795
- [INAUDIBLE]
- What's it, can you stand up?
- [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:35.875 --> 01:11:39.475
- What did he say?
- What is your opinion about the Hare Krishna's?

01:11:39.755 --> 01:11:45.435
Aha, you should find out now what they are up to. You see, this is not the way to go to God.

01:11:46.095 --> 01:11:50.755
Like mad saying something, 'Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna.' In our country everybody says that.

01:11:51.055 --> 01:11:55.375
Even the sweeper, when he sweeps, he goes on saying, 'Hare Rama, Hare Krishna.'

01:11:56.075 --> 01:12:00.055
That's not the way you go to God - it's making fun of God.

01:12:04.915 --> 01:12:11.535
- [INAUDIBLE]
- I'm sorry, the last part could you say it again, please.

01:12:11.835 --> 01:12:15.835
- [INAUDIBLE]
- Kya keh rahe hain?
- Mujhe bhi nahin sunai de raha.
- Ain?

01:12:16.095 --> 01:12:20.175
- Can't hear it. I'm sorry.
- Loudly, please.

01:12:20.455 --> 01:12:24.175
Can anyone become Self-realized [INAUDIBLE]?

01:12:25.455 --> 01:12:30.015
Can anyone become Self-realized and is there anything that can block it from happening?

01:12:30.415 --> 01:12:35.815
Yes it can, yes can be but you don't worry.

01:12:38.355 --> 01:12:43.635
It can block some people, it does. It's all right but ultimately they'll get it.

01:12:44.175 --> 01:12:49.675
If not today tomorrow, if not tomorrow day after - they'll get it. So far we have not met anyone

01:12:49.835 --> 01:12:53.895
who hasn't got it, who has been persistent on it, who's felt it.

01:12:54.495 --> 01:13:00.795
In the beginning people used to take too much time to feel it but nowadays I find most of them feel it very fast.

01:13:01.115 --> 01:13:04.375
Yes please, one more question.

01:13:04.935 --> 01:13:08.755
Two more, all right, now two more and no more.

01:13:09.095 --> 01:13:12.235
- [INAUDIBLE]
- What's it?

01:13:13.515 --> 01:13:20.675
Mother, [UNCLEAR]

01:13:21.055 --> 01:13:24.615
- [UNCLEAR]
- What's he saying?

01:13:24.855 --> 01:13:31.855
You said that you can cure physical problems with sahaja yoga, [UNCLEAR] not just then a physical problem?

01:13:32.515 --> 01:13:38.095
Yes, so what? No, no, you see, it, physical also gets cured.

01:13:38.695 --> 01:13:44.255
You see that's a part of one of the chakras. You see, chakras have got all these things one after another,

01:13:44.475 --> 01:13:51.635
so after enlightenment also physical also get's cured. I didn't say only physical - did I? All right?

01:13:55.335 --> 01:14:00.755
Now, you have asked questions. Should we have those last two, is it all right? All right.

01:14:01.075 --> 01:14:05.515
You'll be very much satisfied after some time, I tell you. Now, let's have

01:14:06.695 --> 01:14:09.835
Who are the two ladies who..? Haan.

01:14:10.295 --> 01:14:18.335
[INAUDIBLE]

01:14:18.575 --> 01:14:26.855
- [INAUDIBLE]
- Kya keh rahe hain?
- [INAUDIBLE]

01:14:27.155 --> 01:14:33.815
- What she's saying?
- Why are there so many different rites and ceremonies and not just a simple approach

01:14:34.195 --> 01:14:42.195
- to God and realization. Is it right?
- Yes, it is, it is madam. It is very simple. You're just facing Me, you'll get your realization.

01:14:42.975 --> 01:14:50.015
But if you want to know the mechanism, then you have to know it that way. You see, mechanism is complicated.

01:14:50.755 --> 01:14:58.715
If you don't want to know the mechanism, there is no need. But you want to know the mechanism always, then you have to know all those things - isn't it?

01:14:59.455 --> 01:15:04.335
Any mechanism is complicated. It's not that complicated also, even children know.

01:15:05.975 --> 01:15:09.655
If you don't want to use the mechanism, then it's all right.

01:15:12.075 --> 01:15:15.915
But if you want to be the engineer, then you want to know.

01:15:16.755 --> 01:15:22.855
But first you get your realization as I told you just now. There's a history behind it, I already told you that there is

01:15:23.075 --> 01:15:28.715
a thing behind it. A mechanism is there. It's not as simple as that, this can be more complicated than that,

01:15:28.935 --> 01:15:35.995
can be deeper than that but depends on how far you want to go. If you just want to have your Self-realization, it's all right,

01:15:36.935 --> 01:15:43.375
but if you want to give realization to others, you have to know all those things - isn't it? Otherwise how will you work it out.

01:15:45.135 --> 01:15:48.175
All right, what else?

01:15:49.955 --> 01:15:54.575
[INAUDIBLE]

01:15:55.295 --> 01:15:58.315
- Is there something else?
- Fate.
- Faith?

01:15:59.455 --> 01:16:04.315
- Fate, yes.
- Fate. Is there something as fate and can we overcome it with realization?

01:16:04.595 --> 01:16:08.095
- Faith?
- Fate.
- Of course, of course.

01:16:08.635 --> 01:16:12.675
- Fate.
- Of course.

01:16:15.895 --> 01:16:21.875
All these things are below the Spirit.

01:16:22.575 --> 01:16:27.895
You rise, transcend everything. You transcend everything -

01:16:28.975 --> 01:16:31.975
that's the mastery I'm talking about.

01:16:37.275 --> 01:16:44.515
- Now
- [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:44.795 --> 01:16:48.315
- I think that was asked earlier
- What she's saying?
- about karma.

01:16:48.775 --> 01:16:53.555
I've told you already. You people have read a lot, I think.

01:16:54.435 --> 01:17:02.155
We have karmas - that's a , that's the thing written before Christ. After Christ whose karmas are left - He's taken away all our karmas.

01:17:02.615 --> 01:17:06.515
Already He's said it, He has died for us - isn't it?

01:17:06.815 --> 01:17:14.375
This was said before, I mean, karma theory was when Krishna was there thousands of years back.

01:17:14.795 --> 01:17:20.775
Now Christ has come. See every tree has different different flowers at different times.

01:17:21.755 --> 01:17:27.755
So according to timing now, Christ has come, He's talked about, He's taken away the karmas.

01:17:28.075 --> 01:17:35.515
Now at this time you have to get your Kundalini awakening - Krishna didn't talk about it, that doesn't mean Kundalini was not there.

01:17:42.095 --> 01:17:49.815
- Well now, let's have the last.
- [INAUDIBLE]

01:17:50.135 --> 01:17:57.535
[INAUDIBLE]

01:17:58.635 --> 01:18:05.515
- Yes.
- How much truth is there in the Bible today as when it was first written

01:18:06.735 --> 01:18:10.275
Oh My! It's quite a lot.

01:18:11.275 --> 01:18:19.075
You see, despite all the things they tried to hide and despite there was all kinds of

01:18:19.335 --> 01:18:23.255
disturbances in the Bible, I must say, there's quite a lot.

01:18:24.395 --> 01:18:31.515
It's quite a lot but we have to be realized to understand Christ, to understand what He said.

01:18:33.755 --> 01:18:40.415
First of all realization must take place otherwise you can't understand - quite a lot - Bible.

01:18:41.755 --> 01:18:47.675
Because they didn't know where the truth was hiding so they couldn't remove it, luckily.

01:18:55.015 --> 01:18:58.095
Yes madam.

01:18:58.935 --> 01:19:06.575
[UNCLEAR] Bible [UNCLEAR]

01:19:06.975 --> 01:19:11.055
[UNCLEAR]

01:19:11.055 --> 01:19:16.835
[UNCLEAR]

01:19:17.395 --> 01:19:22.415
Umm, it is said that there was a secret baptismal right

01:19:22.655 --> 01:19:26.215
given by Christ which is been edited out of the Bible

01:19:26.495 --> 01:19:30.835
- do You equate this with Self-realization and the awakening of Kundalini?
- Of course.

01:19:32.535 --> 01:19:38.975
Of course. Christ must have talked about Kundalini. Today only I was saying, He must have

01:19:39.215 --> 01:19:46.655
but you see, He was given only three and a half years to talk to people. What can you do in three and a half years - you know it's nothing.

01:19:46.895 --> 01:19:53.475
Such a short time? You have no idea that in England I was for four years struggling with seven sahaja yogies.

01:19:55.335 --> 01:20:00.295
It's not easy in those days

01:20:03.195 --> 01:20:09.715
And then His disciples also get very much upset because He was crucified so everybody started asking,

01:20:09.955 --> 01:20:15.175
"How was it, if He was God's Son, how was He crucified?" That was His job, He had to do that.

01:20:17.895 --> 01:20:23.955
He had to pass through this, through His crucifixion. All is explained in sahaja yoga -

01:20:24.295 --> 01:20:29.375
Christ's life, Mohammad's life, Rama's life, Krishna's life - everything is

01:20:29.635 --> 01:20:34.175
absolutely explained and you can see for yourself that They are all one.

01:20:34.535 --> 01:20:39.655
Christ Himself has said, "Those who are not against are with Me." Who are those?

01:20:42.015 --> 01:20:48.595
But we are not allowed to see anything else, just like uh.. horses we have

01:20:48.815 --> 01:20:56.555
blinkers - we can't see anything else. If you want to know about Christ, better read Devi Mahaatma - is all described much better.

01:21:04.835 --> 01:21:08.575
That's why Christianity can be very fanatical, I can tell you,

01:21:08.955 --> 01:21:11.875
because you see, the blinkers are here - you can't see anything.

01:21:12.095 --> 01:21:16.195
You can't read Gita, you can't read anything, you see, going anywhere else

01:21:16.395 --> 01:21:20.875
means you are a non-Christian - such a organized thing.

01:21:22.015 --> 01:21:25.095
But open your eyes and see for yourself.

01:21:29.895 --> 01:21:36.495
Such a great personality like Christ - you see, Onkara Himself incarnated as Christ.

01:21:38.135 --> 01:21:45.675
They have made such a mess out of it, I tell you. Who can believe in Christ when they say what Christianity is?

01:21:47.535 --> 01:21:54.175
Such a mess! Same about, I would say, Hinduism, same about Islam, every religion is the same style.

01:21:55.375 --> 01:22:00.735
It's same style, there's nothing to choose.

01:22:03.215 --> 01:22:06.215
All have gone wrong.

01:22:12.075 --> 01:22:18.215
In the name of God wars, in the name of God money,

01:22:19.475 --> 01:22:25.755
in the name of God enjoying women, lust and greed

01:22:26.175 --> 01:22:30.995
while Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

01:22:33.195 --> 01:22:36.235
because He rules the eyes.

01:22:40.935 --> 01:22:46.255
You'll understand what Christ is once you're realized.

01:22:55.195 --> 01:22:58.255
Yes, now still [UNCLEAR]

01:22:58.835 --> 01:23:06.155
[UNCLEAR]

01:23:06.955 --> 01:23:12.615
Is there such a  thing as people not being ready for Self-realization, in this lifetime?

01:23:13.135 --> 01:23:20.855
I don't think, I don't say that. I think all of them are there for realization.

01:23:23.195 --> 01:23:28.375
Everybody can get realization but if you're identified with nonsense

01:23:29.935 --> 01:23:34.015
If you put your foot in the crocodile's mouth

01:23:34.635 --> 01:23:39.195
and one foot on the boat, what are we to do?

01:23:42.235 --> 01:23:49.955
There's a blossom time, is a special Resurrection time - this is the time of judgment, has to happen.

01:23:51.155 --> 01:23:59.015
Everybody must get their chance. God is justice, He's fair.

01:24:07.915 --> 01:24:13.795
Now, still going on, all right. Ask one question, now let it be the last - all right?

01:24:15.435 --> 01:24:21.515
[UNCLEAR - BECAUSE?]There are so many who are anxious to get realization, madam. Now come along. What's your question, special one?

01:24:21.935 --> 01:24:26.555
[INAUDIBLE]

01:24:26.815 --> 01:24:30.735
- [UNCLEAR] kya?
- I'm sorry, if you could just

01:24:31.755 --> 01:24:38.535
- [INAUDIBLE N UNCLEAR] immortality.
- Will You tell us about immortality?

01:24:38.755 --> 01:24:45.315
- [INAUDIBLE]
- Through Self-realization will we know the immortal?

01:24:45.795 --> 01:24:48.975
- What we know?
- The immortal.
- Of course.

01:24:49.175 --> 01:24:52.235
- [INAUDIBLE]
- Of course
- Will we know

01:24:52.795 --> 01:24:58.975
The Immortal, that's the Spirit. That's what I'm saying - that's the Spirit.

01:25:03.375 --> 01:25:08.035
All right, so let's have it now. All the questions are over.

01:25:13.855 --> 01:25:21.355
Now, first of all we have to understand little cooperation is needed

01:25:22.515 --> 01:25:28.015
raising the Kundalini. If you could just take out the shoes -

01:25:28.715 --> 01:25:34.235
this Mother Earth helps Me a lot and will help you a lot - just take out your shoes - simple thing.

01:25:34.515 --> 01:25:40.635
Taking out shoe is not difficult - is it? All right.

01:25:41.255 --> 01:25:48.255
And if you can put your feet on the Mother Earth. Now those who don't want to do, should go out; Should not disturb us.

01:25:48.835 --> 01:25:54.795
I'll be thankful - those who don't want to do it should go away. It is absolutely your freedom

01:25:55.015 --> 01:26:01.915
and it hardly takes about five to ten minutes - much less than your questioning.

01:26:06.255 --> 01:26:09.195
All right.

01:26:11.195 --> 01:26:17.275
Now both the feet on the ground separately because these are two powers, as I told you, the left and the right.

01:26:19.735 --> 01:26:27.615
This should not be mixed up. Now left hand is towards Me because this is the desire you have

01:26:30.255 --> 01:26:36.855
that you want to have your realization. You can keep it comfortably on your lap, if you want to - be comfortable.

01:26:37.175 --> 01:26:41.895
You need not put your neck very tight or very low - just in the center.

01:26:42.355 --> 01:26:48.375
With the right hand I will tell you how you will raise your own Kundalini - very simple.

01:26:49.335 --> 01:26:55.955
First of all, I'll tell you and then you'll have to close your eyes and do it. First of all you'll have to put it on your heart

01:26:57.035 --> 01:27:03.435
just like this. Now in the heart resides - all of you should do it on the heart. On the heart resides

01:27:03.895 --> 01:27:08.435
the Spirit - all right? Please do it , sir, please.You don't want to do it?

01:27:10.655 --> 01:27:16.515
What's the matter? [ SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] He's got it already, I think. [ SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

01:27:16.795 --> 01:27:21.115
He's in thoughtless awareness. Now put it, your right hand, on the heart.

01:27:21.615 --> 01:27:26.635
And here heart, in the heart resides the Spirit.

01:27:29.975 --> 01:27:36.475
Below that is the center here, is of principle of mastery

01:27:37.015 --> 01:27:42.355
or guidance or guru or ten commandments - on the left-hand side.

01:27:49.175 --> 01:27:56.755
Now below that is another center, down here, below on the left-hand side. Everything works on the left-hand side

01:28:02.315 --> 01:28:09.015
below in the lower part of the abdomen. On the left-hand side is the center through which all the Divine laws work.

01:28:13.035 --> 01:28:18.615
So, then again we go up on the upper part of the stomach on the left-hand side.

01:28:20.455 --> 01:28:26.535
Then we go to the heart again. Now here we go

01:28:31.475 --> 01:28:38.275
in the corner between the neck and your shoulder and turn your head to the right -

01:28:38.555 --> 01:28:45.755
is very simple, like that. But don't take your hand from the back - just from here, from the front. Hold it tight.

01:28:47.835 --> 01:28:54.835
This is the main center that catches because you feel guilty for nothing at all. That's a fashion nowadays to feel guilty.

01:28:55.355 --> 01:29:02.735
Now don't feel guilty. You have come at the door

01:29:03.975 --> 01:29:09.135
of God's Kingdom so be pleasantly placed towards yourself and forgive yourself.

01:29:09.835 --> 01:29:13.935
Don't feel guilty at all, be happy. Now,

01:29:14.875 --> 01:29:22.775
put your hand on top of your head in such a manner, I [UNCLEAR- MEAN?} on, on your forehead

01:29:23.475 --> 01:29:31.295
and press it on both the sides in such a manner as you press it when you have headaches. Press it slowly.

01:29:32.135 --> 01:29:37.715
Then take this hand on the back side of your head and put the

01:29:40.715 --> 01:29:45.115
load of your head on that hand, like this,

01:29:46.355 --> 01:29:52.615
slowly. Now bring this hand and stretch it nicely.

01:29:54.135 --> 01:30:01.855
The center of this palm you put it on the fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:30:02.975 --> 01:30:09.775
Now, move it seven times - the scalp - keeping the fingers out.

01:30:10.115 --> 01:30:14.495
Move it seven times putting the left hand towards Me -

01:30:14.935 --> 01:30:18.695
slowly, seven times. Now.

01:30:29.935 --> 01:30:33.735
Now first of all, you're not to feel guilty.

01:30:34.275 --> 01:30:39.135
You should be pleasantly placed towards yourself in a very happy mood.

01:30:40.855 --> 01:30:45.315
You shouldn't say, "I've done this wrong, that wrong," nothing of the kind.

01:30:46.635 --> 01:30:52.095
Now, close your eyes. Even you can take out your spectacles if you want

01:30:52.395 --> 01:30:57.135
because sometimes the eyesight gets better. So, close your eyes

01:30:57.815 --> 01:31:02.255
Put your left hand towards Me and right hand on the heart.

01:31:03.815 --> 01:31:10.635
In the heart resides the Spirit so ask Me a fundamental question -

01:31:12.055 --> 01:31:16.015
you can call Me Shri Mataji or Mother, whichever way you like.

01:31:17.495 --> 01:31:23.075
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" Ask this question in your heart three times,

01:31:23.595 --> 01:31:26.675
"Mother, am I the Spirit?"

01:31:27.715 --> 01:31:35.155
Please put both your hands, feet together. You don't want to do it, madam?

01:31:50.375 --> 01:31:57.175
Ask this question. Now, bring that hand on the left-hand side

01:31:57.695 --> 01:32:02.755
of the upper part of the abdomen of the stomach, press it and here

01:32:03.015 --> 01:32:08.855
you have to ask another question because if you are the Spirit, you are your master also.

01:32:09.595 --> 01:32:13.415
Ask Me a question, "Mother, am I my own master?"

01:32:17.375 --> 01:32:20.435
Three times please.

01:32:34.555 --> 01:32:39.455
Now, take down this hand, down below.

01:32:40.855 --> 01:32:46.695
Again on the left-hand side in the lower part of your abdomen and press it hard.

01:32:47.175 --> 01:32:53.235
Now this is the center of pure knowledge or the laws

01:32:55.015 --> 01:33:01.975
that are Divine. So you press it hard and please

01:33:02.315 --> 01:33:08.375
say six times because there are six petals to this center.

01:33:09.295 --> 01:33:14.875
"Mother, may I have the pure knowledge?"

01:33:15.235 --> 01:33:20.335
I cannot force so you have to ask for it. So ask for it,

01:33:20.635 --> 01:33:28.155
"Mother, please may I have the pure knowledge of the truth?"

01:33:32.235 --> 01:33:36.095
Six times, ask from your heart.

01:33:45.495 --> 01:33:51.695
Now, take this hand upwards,

01:33:52.595 --> 01:33:57.855
press it on the upper part of the abdomen on the left-hand side

01:33:58.435 --> 01:34:03.835
and here ask for ten, ten times, ten times

01:34:05.755 --> 01:34:13.575
or here you can say, here you have to help the Kundalini. You have to help the Kundalini,

01:34:14.495 --> 01:34:20.915
to co-ordinate with Her because She has started moving now. As soon as you asked

01:34:21.575 --> 01:34:28.735
for pure knowledge, She started moving. So here you put your hand and press it hard and ask

01:34:29.315 --> 01:34:34.515
or you can say it just to support the Kundalini,

01:34:35.135 --> 01:34:40.915
"Mother, I am my own master."

01:34:43.655 --> 01:34:48.675
"Mother, I am my own master," say it ten times please.

01:34:58.975 --> 01:35:02.335
Now, ten times.

01:35:06.435 --> 01:35:13.875
With full confidence, without any guilt, without anything, "I am my own master," you have to support the Kundalini.

01:35:17.395 --> 01:35:20.415
Now.

01:35:37.855 --> 01:35:45.215
Now raise your hand to your heart. Here again to support your Kundalini to rise,

01:35:45.555 --> 01:35:50.655
to co-operate with  Her, with full confidence you have to see the greatest truth

01:35:51.075 --> 01:35:54.895
lies within you that, "Mother,

01:35:56.455 --> 01:36:00.775
I am the Spirit. Mother, I am the spirit."

01:36:01.495 --> 01:36:07.655
Please say it twelve times. "I am the Spirit," please say it ten times, with full confidence.

01:36:36.575 --> 01:36:44.375
You have to know that God almighty is the ocean

01:36:44.775 --> 01:36:50.395
of love and Grace but above all

01:36:51.755 --> 01:36:58.055
He is the ocean of forgiveness, He is the ocean of forgiveness

01:36:58.695 --> 01:37:05.475
and He forgives whatever we do. After all human-beings have to commit mistakes - there's nothing wrong in it.

01:37:09.515 --> 01:37:15.075
No need to be angry with yourself at all. Please raise your right hand

01:37:17.535 --> 01:37:25.175
on your shoulder in the corner between the neck and the shoulder.

01:37:27.935 --> 01:37:35.555
And here press it hard and you say with full confidence sixteen times,

01:37:36.135 --> 01:37:42.595
"Mother, I'm not guilty." Please say it sixteen times, turn your head to the right.

01:37:43.535 --> 01:37:48.495
Please turn your head to the right and say,"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

01:38:01.895 --> 01:38:06.615
Please say, "Mother, I'm not guilty at all," sixteen times.

01:38:14.455 --> 01:38:17.475
Now,

01:38:26.895 --> 01:38:32.175
please put your right hand

01:38:34.175 --> 01:38:41.375
on your forehead across, press it on both the sides.

01:38:42.895 --> 01:38:50.795
Here, from your heart you have to say, how many times is not the point,

01:38:52.775 --> 01:38:58.535
from your heart you have to say, "Mother, I forgive everyone

01:39:00.715 --> 01:39:04.915
Now many people think that's very difficult to forgive

01:39:05.355 --> 01:39:09.955
but actually, we do not do anything whether you forgive or we do not forgive.

01:39:10.475 --> 01:39:13.995
But if we do not forgive, then we play into wrong hands

01:39:14.295 --> 01:39:18.375
so say it from your heart, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

01:39:29.315 --> 01:39:34.235
Now, take this hand on the back side, put your head

01:39:37.075 --> 01:39:43.475
on it and turn it upward - let it rest on the hand.

01:39:44.715 --> 01:39:49.995
Here for your own satisfaction, you may say, "Oh Divine,

01:39:50.495 --> 01:39:57.135
please forgive me if any mistakes I have made." This is only for your own satisfaction I'm saying.

01:39:57.375 --> 01:40:02.215
Now don't count your mistakes, please don't count your mistakes.

01:40:04.355 --> 01:40:08.235
You have to be very loving and sweet towards yourself.

01:40:20.235 --> 01:40:26.295
Now, stretch your hand, please, fully.

01:40:29.055 --> 01:40:33.815
Put your center of your palm, please, on

01:40:34.075 --> 01:40:40.555
the fontanel bone area and press it very hard and move it, very slowly, seven times.

01:40:41.075 --> 01:40:47.955
Here again you have to ask for your realization, so say, "Mother, please give me my Self-realization."

01:40:48.775 --> 01:40:54.915
Say seven times - I can't force it on you, I'm sorry - seven times.

01:40:56.855 --> 01:41:02.135
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:41:02.435 --> 01:41:06.375

01:41:06.775 --> 01:41:10.435

[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:41:24.515 --> 01:41:28.375
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:41:28.795 --> 01:41:33.915
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:41:35.195 --> 01:41:41.695
Now, take down your hand, please. Slowly open your eyes, slowly.

01:41:42.915 --> 01:41:48.795
Now, put your left hand on top of your head and right hand towards Me.

01:41:49.035 --> 01:41:53.535
Left hand on top of your head, left hand. Right hand towards Me.

01:41:53.855 --> 01:41:57.875
Now see, if there's a cool breeze coming. Now move up and down and see for yourself.

01:42:02.895 --> 01:42:05.875
All right?

01:42:08.875 --> 01:42:14.715
Feeling it? Little, some people get it that point, some get it very high.

01:42:15.995 --> 01:42:23.875
Little bit higher. Don't doubt yourself, please don't doubt yourself.

01:42:27.455 --> 01:42:31.015
Now, put the left hand towards Me and see with the right hand.

01:42:31.855 --> 01:42:37.095
Some might be getting hot, doesn't matter. Hot will become cool very soon.

01:42:40.395 --> 01:42:45.115
You can bend your head and see for yourself, it'll be better and easier.

01:42:54.615 --> 01:42:59.915
Now, put the right hand again towards Me and with the left hand

01:43:20.475 --> 01:43:25.335
All right? Now, put both the hands towards the sky

01:43:27.055 --> 01:43:33.915
and ask a question three times, "Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost that is the Kundalini?"

01:43:34.835 --> 01:43:41.715
"Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Is this the Brahma Chaitanya?"

01:43:43.435 --> 01:43:50.355
"Is this the love of God that is All-Pervading Power?" You ask any one of these, three times.

01:44:00.155 --> 01:44:03.655
All right, now we can keep it down.

01:44:05.815 --> 01:44:10.835
Now, let us see how many of you have got it on top of your head

01:44:11.295 --> 01:44:16.135
and also in other, also in your hands. Please put both your hands.

01:44:16.455 --> 01:44:21.755
I want to see how many have got it on top of your head or in your hands.

01:44:23.795 --> 01:44:31.195
Both the hands, please. Don't be doubtful. If it is there, put your hands up. Not today, tomorrow they'll - it's quite a lot.

01:44:32.495 --> 01:44:38.855
Quite a lot of people. You got it now - good. So, no questions tomorrow. Ha

01:44:39.635 --> 01:44:46.415
Good. May God bless you! Quite a lot of people have got it, some people haven't got it I must say.

01:44:47.375 --> 01:44:55.275
Ah! Sydney was better in a way. But I think we spent too much time in questioning that's how people [UNCLEAR] loose their

01:44:55.655 --> 01:45:02.655
uh.. attention a little bit - doesn't matter. If it has not worked out it will work out tomorrow in any case.

01:45:03.335 --> 01:45:10.435
And I'll be here again to meet you and to greet you and I'll explain to you all the rest of things.

01:45:10.855 --> 01:45:17.175
Those who haven't got it, if you're anxious or to get it, I think, you could,

01:45:17.815 --> 01:45:25.035
they can come down here and can work it on certain people - a big row of people didn't get here in the center.

01:45:25.355 --> 01:45:32.535
If you can see, some of you people, uh.. those, these two persons should get it - I don't know why they didn't - you didn't feel it?

01:45:32.875 --> 01:45:38.435
Sure? I think you did feel, madam. You felt it? You felt it?

01:45:38.815 --> 01:45:46.435
Good. You can feel each other, you can feel each other's head, yes. What about you - no? What about you - you got it? Got it.

01:45:46.855 --> 01:45:53.915
Most of them have but in the third row or fourth row there are people. Who have not felt it, please?

01:45:54.415 --> 01:45:59.855
Ah, do you mind uh.. seeing them or what should we do?

01:46:02.795 --> 01:46:06.595
You also will be having a workshop later on.

01:46:07.435 --> 01:46:14.915
Just see, your neighbors, you see from your neighbors, should see. This gentleman - can you see on his head, he hasn't got it?

01:46:15.195 --> 01:46:19.935
You put your hands. You said you didn't get it. Just see this gentleman why he hasn't got it?

01:46:21.135 --> 01:46:25.135
Hello, some sahaja yogi should see some of these people.

01:46:27.015 --> 01:46:33.155
Third person, that fourth person. No, she never tried. She was just sitting there tight.

01:46:38.715 --> 01:46:41.755
Maybe in the hands but

01:46:47.615 --> 01:46:50.635
He's got it - you've got it?

01:46:52.015 --> 01:46:57.375
Now he's felt it, now he's felt it. You see, it's one of the sahaja yogies puts the hand also, they'll feel it.

01:46:57.675 --> 01:47:00.895
Those who haven't put in the first row, raise your hands, please?

01:47:02.095 --> 01:47:06.735
Ah, just see this gentleman, just one minute they can work it out, ah..

01:47:07.615 --> 01:47:13.075
Also you can watch Me without thinking, you see. Just see, just watch Me without thinking.

01:47:19.955 --> 01:47:25.095
- [INAUDIBLE]
- Really?

01:47:27.955 --> 01:47:32.435
Raise it, raise it. Today I've worked very hard, I think, she, they should.

01:47:39.215 --> 01:47:46.815
Now you felt it, all right. Now, can we have some more sahaja yogies to work out here? Just see.

01:47:51.955 --> 01:47:57.115
You didn't feel that, none of you - did you feel?

01:48:00.275 --> 01:48:06.215
What of the boy who was feeling sad? Just see, did he feel, did he feel the cool breeze?

01:48:07.535 --> 01:48:14.615
The second number there with the yellow, this thing. He's felt it. Now, you've got it.

01:48:15.055 --> 01:48:20.975
Now you have to give joy to everyone - all right? He's got it, good.

01:48:21.775 --> 01:48:28.055
This lady is here, just see. Take one or two persons who haven't felt it and who are desire. No?

01:49:02.075 --> 01:49:07.275
Hmm, better. He's got it, has he?

01:49:10.755 --> 01:49:15.335
- Got it.Is he feeling it?
- [UNCLEAR]

01:49:15.575 --> 01:49:21.795

01:49:25.135 --> 01:49:31.495
- [INAUDIBLE]
- Now he's feeling it.

01:49:32.295 --> 01:49:40.335
[SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] With the slightest here and there it just loops down in a funny way.

01:49:41.915 --> 01:49:48.555
Where are the sahaj yogies gone? Come along. Just see this lady is here, she wants to have her realization. Didn't feel it?

01:49:49.315 --> 01:49:52.275
- You did not feel?

01:49:52.495 --> 01:49:55.555

01:49:59.595 --> 01:50:03.835
Now you must inform your friends and bring them along tomorrow.

01:50:11.795 --> 01:50:14.815
Hmm, better.

01:50:20.235 --> 01:50:27.695
I think in the second row, [UNCLEAR] in the third row. What about the gentleman who asked about precautions. Did you feel the cool breeze?

01:50:29.555 --> 01:50:32.495
The gentleman in the fourth row.

01:50:34.795 --> 01:50:40.595
Aey Rustom, fourth row mein dekho na, woh jo precautions ki baat kari.

01:50:44.195 --> 01:50:47.855
Na idhar, idhar aao.

01:50:59.195 --> 01:51:04.495
Haan, all right. Fourth

Haan, he's the gentleman. Did he feel the cool breeze?

01:51:20.175 --> 01:51:24.895
That's it. Give him realization, I knew, give him realization.

01:51:53.355 --> 01:52:01.275
Haan, heart - right heart, right heart.

01:52:02.795 --> 01:52:06.035
Give him a bandhan on right heart.

Haan, now, see there.

01:52:36.635 --> 01:52:42.495
Are you feeling relaxed? Can't think, just try to think.

01:53:00.615 --> 01:53:05.035
Tumhare bas.. ho jayega, I'll manage.

01:53:16.015 --> 01:53:23.255

Yes. Can you help Me with the shoes.. little bit. I don't know why it's can't reach that - thank you.

01:53:38.815 --> 01:53:44.215
See this one also if you can - thank you. Done a good job, I think.

01:53:45.155 --> 01:53:49.475
- It's worked out well.
- It's difficult to get in the seats  because they're
- Unnh?

01:53:49.715 --> 01:53:54.395
- It's difficult to get in between the seats, the way
- Yes
- they're designed they're too close.

01:53:55.995 --> 01:54:02.695
Let it be. This lady didn't do anything -

01:54:03.235 --> 01:54:07.875
just sitting tight. Should have got your realization -  what a chance!

01:54:09.095 --> 01:54:14.295
She's come all the way. You - I'm saying about this second one - yes.

01:54:16.435 --> 01:54:23.515
Didn't do anything, should have - just five minutes. Heaven on Earth.

What about you? Come along, come along. Come along.

You want to say something - come here. No you. Saying something to Me?

01:54:44.995 --> 01:54:48.035
No, it's all right.

01:54:52.435 --> 01:54:59.115
I'd like to meet them if they want. Come along! Haan.

01:55:03.795 --> 01:55:06.795

Work very hard? Ah, that's why. They'll tell you all about it. It's all right.

Better? It's too much working hard, that's all.

All of you have to now learn all about. Now you have to become masters, Australian born [UNCLEAR]

And get some more people now. This is the thing. You invite for dinners and this and that. Better invite them for this.

02:01:25.615 --> 02:01:31.915
All right? That's the greatest thing to be given. How are you, all right?

02:01:32.195 --> 02:01:36.215

- Yes
- Don't see any disease there, nothing is shaking.

02:02:00.035 --> 02:02:07.755
- Oh! I, will the workshop be on Thursday, will it?
- Thursday. But now Parkinson disease you must, you're not shaking at all.

No, no, no, forget all that. [UNCLEAR] sahaja yoga, why should you [INAUDIBLE].

02:05:23.915 --> 02:05:30.075
You just say that, "Mother, I am my own master - ten times." Forget all these things. Just see

02:05:30.395 --> 02:05:34.955
how much you're perspiring. If that book was good you would not perspire before Me.

02:05:35.355 --> 02:05:41.015

Why do they want to come? If they're realized souls, be satisfied. If they're realized souls, what work are they doing?

02:11:21.815 --> 02:11:27.075

02:13:29.675 --> 02:13:37.335
[SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] Despite doubting it has worked, you see. You must have been a seeker in your last life.

Annh? Just know it.

02:14:08.295 --> 02:14:12.815
Not from the head. Vishudhdhi is

02:14:19.035 --> 02:14:25.555
Not yet. It is on the head. You can't feel it because, you see, your Vishudhdhi, this is purely blocked

02:14:25.835 --> 02:14:30.355
with lot of [INAUDIBLE]. Once it is

02:14:56.595 --> 02:15:02.015

02:15:23.615 --> 02:15:29.075
should set. You're Australia, Australian out and out.

02:15:29.355 --> 02:15:37.035
- My parents are Dutch.
- Your parents are Dutch? All right. Come along. Makes no difference.

02:15:49.055 --> 02:15:55.955
- [INAUDIBLE]
- Haan, it's better.

- [INAUDIBLE]
- In the hands what's happened?

02:16:03.035 --> 02:16:09.915
Dying? Left.

02:16:15.435 --> 02:16:20.735
- The disease of the nerves.
- I know, I know.
- The nervous system

02:16:21.055 --> 02:16:24.175
- Where's he [UNCLEAR], where's he

02:16:24.415 --> 02:16:31.715
No, no, no, there's nothing like that,
you see, [INAUDIBLE] Raise his Kundalini, he's quite all right.

02:16:33.175 --> 02:16:39.315
- You take off your shoes.[UNCLEAR]
