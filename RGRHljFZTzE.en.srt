1
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:17,920


2
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,840


3
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,840
exciting

4
00:01:33,197 --> 00:01:36,637
 Shri Mataji, the point that we were discussing this

5
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:40,557
morning, we discovered here, that is the section

6
00:01:40,557 --> 00:01:41,936
which is quoted.

7
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:36,389
Now this is the section:
“ I also tell you that you are Peter and

8
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:41,029
on this rock  I will build My Church and the gates of Hades,

9
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:45,389
the gates of Hell shall not prevail against her” (the church) 

10
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:48,873
“I will give you the keys of the kingdom of Heaven.

11
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:52,571
Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in Heaven.”

12
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:54,721
That was what you do on earth,

13
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:57,861
I will make sure it happens in Heaven! Nonsense!

14
00:02:57,858 --> 00:03:01,656
“Whatever you allow on earth will be allowed in Heaven”.

15
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:03,396
Shri Mataji: This is nonsense.

16
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:05,079
Brian: This is nonsense. “Then He….”

17
00:03:06,179 --> 00:03:09,246
Shri Mataji: You see, how could He say that?

18
00:03:09,309 --> 00:03:11,156
Brian: How could He?

19
00:03:16,918 --> 00:03:20,118
Brian:  It must be true, Mother, it’s in the Bible!

20
00:03:26,648 --> 00:03:30,288
Shri Mataji: (unclear…) can you read there..(unclear)?

21
00:03:30,327 --> 00:03:35,318
Brian: “Then He forbade the disciples to say to anyone He is the Christ”

22
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:40,621
So He wanted to keep it a secret or something, I don’t understand…

23
00:03:42,116 --> 00:03:43,171
Yes, yes.

24
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:50,486
Shri Mataji:    What’s the meaning of Christ….(unclear) ?

25
00:03:51,295 --> 00:03:55,526
Brian:  Christ is the sacrifice, the chosen one, the chosen one

26
00:03:55,595 --> 00:03:58,502
of the chosen people. 

27
00:04:03,602 --> 00:04:07,452
It’s the Greek, the Greek equivalent of the Messiah.

28
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,614
Shri Mataji: It comes from Krishna….(inaudible)

29
00:04:16,932 --> 00:04:18,772
Brian:  Krist.

30
00:04:20,002 --> 00:04:22,828
Shri Mataji: And Yeshu comes from the…

31
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:24,414
Brian: Yeshoda

32
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:25,997
Shri Mataji: Yeshoda.

33
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:29,577
Brian:  It’s beautiful that. But not many Christians would believe it.

34
00:04:29,692 --> 00:04:32,197
Shri Mataji: They wouldn’t agree with it.

35
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:35,447
Brian: No. No, they’d think that was sacrilege.
