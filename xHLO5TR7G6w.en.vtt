WEBVTT

02:08.749 --> 02:22.843
I’ve been desiring all the time that
I should go to Turkey or Tunisia

02:23.044 --> 02:28.161
where there could be an entry into
the Islamic world,

02:32.302 --> 02:42.477
because they have been promised that
they will be resurrected,

02:43.105 --> 02:47.231
and that resurrection has to take place.

02:47.432 --> 02:50.505
For that I have to venture

02:50.706 --> 02:56.166
and give them their resurrection which is
promised by Mohammed Sahib,

02:56.367 --> 03:02.125
I mean that’s My duty; and not only duty,
but I’m bound by it,

03:02.326 --> 03:07.258
that I have to tell them about their
resurrection and to save them.

03:07.440 --> 03:10.687
They deserve it, no doubt.

03:16.282 --> 03:19.904
When all the religions prospered

03:20.951 --> 03:25.009
in a very funny manner, I would say,
separately,

03:25.225 --> 03:27.905
everyone thinking they are the best,
the chosen ones,

03:28.106 --> 03:33.822
the highest ones, the greatest ones,
believing in themselves,

03:35.927 --> 03:40.107
they started going down and down and down.

03:40.949 --> 03:49.307
The reason is, you see, there is no respect
for each other.

03:52.047 --> 03:57.636
And the respect is not there because
there is no respect for oneself.

03:57.837 --> 04:01.209
If you respect yourself, you respect others
also.

04:01.410 --> 04:06.706
But when you have no respect for yourself,
you cannot respect others;

04:07.179 --> 04:09.173
but you should bombastically say that,

04:09.374 --> 04:12.998
“I’m this, I’m that, I’m that” –
any religion.

04:15.239 --> 04:17.889
Then your ego works,

04:18.090 --> 04:26.720
and ego makes you a person who does not
know about yourself.

04:26.921 --> 04:34.408
If somebody has respect for oneself,
he will never push forward,

04:34.609 --> 04:44.115
he will never try to be something
prominent, he’ll never try to show off.

04:44.316 --> 04:54.586
On the contrary such a person would be
hesitant to do something

04:54.787 --> 05:01.579
out of the way, something arbitrary,

05:01.780 --> 05:11.806
something showy, because it is absurd,
and it is stupid.

05:12.007 --> 05:19.171
So to do something stupid is a sign of ego,

05:19.372 --> 05:25.576
absolutely ego makes you stupid, and
ultimately with it you become idiotic.

05:28.377 --> 05:33.718
So the respect for oneself has to be
developed and as Sahaja Yogis

05:33.919 --> 05:41.357
you have to respect yourself: “We are
Sahaja Yogis, so how can we do like that?”

05:41.558 --> 05:45.707
As I told you that if you teach your
children all the time that,

05:45.908 --> 05:49.872
“You are Sahaja Yogis, you are something
exceptional”,

05:50.073 --> 05:54.232
then they will have respect for themselves,
self-respect.

05:54.433 --> 05:56.248
Is a very good word, “self-respect”,

05:56.449 --> 06:00.166
I don’t know how many people know about it.
Only when they are insulted or troubled

06:00.367 --> 06:03.623
they think of their self-respect, otherwise
they go amok

06:03.824 --> 06:08.852
and behave in such a manner that as if
they have no self-respect of any kind.

06:10.433 --> 06:14.977
So as Sahaja Yogis we have to have
self-respect.

06:15.178 --> 06:21.978
And when we have to have Sahaja Yoga
as our manifestation,

06:22.179 --> 06:31.160
as our personality, as Yogis, we have
to have a sense of self-respect.

06:31.361 --> 06:34.867
And even now you can find on the periphery
you find many people

06:35.068 --> 06:40.624
who lack self-respect and understanding.

06:41.547 --> 06:48.009
Some people are still sort of parasitic.

06:48.210 --> 06:53.254
Some people hang on to things when they
are told not to hang on,

06:53.455 --> 06:57.503
to take it easy, to work it out, they
try to assert,

06:57.704 --> 07:02.085
“No, we’ll be there, we are going to be
there, we are going to fight it out.”

07:02.294 --> 07:06.211
That’s not for a self-respecting person;

07:08.511 --> 07:11.575
it’s a foolish thing to do.

07:11.912 --> 07:18.270
Like two persons were going, one up
on the staircase, another coming down.

07:18.471 --> 07:23.543
So the one who was going up in his ego,
he says,

07:23.744 --> 07:27.787
“You better move; I don’t move for fools.”

07:27.988 --> 07:33.107
So the another one says, “I do”
and he moved.

07:36.406 --> 07:41.533
So this is what is the sign of a sensible,
wise, self-respecting person.

07:41.741 --> 07:49.044
He doesn’t go into fights, he doesn’t go
into unnecessary discussions

07:49.245 --> 07:57.307
and arguments and assertiveness, but
he sees – “Wait, is it worth it?”

07:57.508 --> 08:00.357
But when it comes to protection of truth,

08:00.558 --> 08:06.958
he stands up and he can find lot of courage
for the truth.

08:07.159 --> 08:10.404
I think self-respect is the first beginning
for Sahaja Yoga,

08:10.605 --> 08:15.066
is to develop self-respect in their inner
being

08:15.267 --> 08:20.119
as well as in their manifestation.

08:21.294 --> 08:25.586
It shows very well in protocol also,

08:25.787 --> 08:31.471
like I’ve seen people who - supposing
I have to go to Brighton,

08:31.672 --> 08:35.702
“Mother is going, all right, we’ll go
in Her car.”

08:37.954 --> 08:41.132
If it was for My love, that’s different;

08:41.333 --> 08:45.830
but just to save some money, “Let’s just
jump into the car”.

08:46.726 --> 08:50.023
That’s not a sign of a good Sahaja Yogi.

08:50.224 --> 08:55.171
Then it is also in power, when they have
to express their power, you see.

08:55.372 --> 08:57.889
Like the other day one girl came to Me,

08:58.090 --> 09:00.711
she had given realization, she was
all right.

09:00.912 --> 09:05.349
Second day she came, “Mother, I lost
my vibrations.”

09:05.550 --> 09:09.401
I said, “Why, what happened? With whom
were you talking?”

09:09.602 --> 09:12.140
So she told Me the name of a lady who
was asked

09:12.341 --> 09:19.756
to get out of Sahaja Yoga, Alice, and
she talked to Alice.

09:19.957 --> 09:22.071
This Alice was allowed to come
to the program

09:22.272 --> 09:24.900
but she took over as if she is a great
Sahaja Yogini

09:25.101 --> 09:28.698
explaining Sahaja Yoga to this lady and
finished her vibrations.

09:28.899 --> 09:34.863
Now this lady is such an important thing
because she was going to Florida.

09:37.052 --> 09:39.661
If she is just allowed to come in
the program she thinks

09:39.862 --> 09:42.163
she is now a very big Sahaja Yogini and
she can talk to anyone

09:42.364 --> 09:48.326
whatever she wants to, and spoil
the vibrations of another person.

09:48.527 --> 09:52.636
If I’ve appointed somebody as a leader,
it is not on the basis of their looks

09:52.837 --> 09:58.834
or education or anything, but on their
vibrations and their dedication.

10:01.177 --> 10:05.357
So the Sahaja Yogis have to seriously think
about it.

10:05.558 --> 10:08.485
Such people are always around to show off
their knowledge.

10:08.686 --> 10:12.884
You see, in Sahaja Yoga is so easy,
the knowledge part of it, it’s very easy.

10:13.085 --> 10:18.155
Anybody who is intelligent enough can read:
this is the chakras, this is this,

10:18.356 --> 10:26.322
they can give big lectures, explain this
deity sits on this chakra. It’s so simple.

10:29.727 --> 10:39.294
But the compassion and knowledge,
hand in hand, makes a Sahaja Yogi.

10:39.495 --> 10:43.966
Now some people have another style,
is of compassion.

10:44.167 --> 10:46.653
Naturally compassion is always sympathy,
as I told you,

10:46.854 --> 10:53.065
except when it is with knowledge is
all right.

10:53.266 --> 10:56.449
But just compassion -

10:56.989 --> 11:02.097
with compassion they will always sympathize
with all the bhootish people.

11:02.298 --> 11:06.413
If there’s one bhootish person in Sahaja
Yoga, he’ll bring ten more on Me,

11:06.614 --> 11:12.248
“Mother, look after this person, look after
this person, look after that person.”

11:12.449 --> 11:16.022
Firstly because that person was damaged

11:16.223 --> 11:22.023
and secondly because that damaged
personality thinks that,

11:22.224 --> 11:25.829
“Another is damaged, let us save this
damaged person.”

11:26.030 --> 11:30.073
All right, if it is so, first of all you
should be all right,

11:30.274 --> 11:35.342
and tell that person to “work on yourself”,
because if you try to help that person,

11:35.543 --> 11:39.621
your negativity will increase. You’ll go
from bad to worse.

11:39.822 --> 11:47.843
Always sympathies will go to a person
who is not all right, we should say.

11:48.044 --> 11:51.537
So you tell such a person, “All right,
you work it out this way,

11:51.738 --> 11:55.378
but I have nothing to do with you”,
or send that person

11:55.579 --> 12:00.215
to somebody who is an egoistical,
so they share better.

12:00.416 --> 12:04.403
There’s complimentary between the two,
and it works out better

12:04.604 --> 12:09.079
and saves Me a little worry.

12:10.342 --> 12:14.667
But beyond all this the combination
of these two

12:14.868 --> 12:18.813
actually must emit vibrations.

12:19.553 --> 12:26.297
It is how many vibrations you have within
yourself is the point which one should see.

12:27.656 --> 12:30.982
First the vibrations when they are,

12:31.183 --> 12:36.070
how are we to know we are all right
as far as vibrations are concerned?

12:36.271 --> 12:46.057
What is the sign of being a good Sahaja
Yogi, or we are really Sahaja Yogi,

12:46.258 --> 12:52.413
is that we develop a kind of a detachment.

12:55.668 --> 13:00.667
First the detachment comes naturally
because you are away from your body,

13:00.868 --> 13:06.771
so you are not bothered about your body,
you don’t think about it.

13:06.972 --> 13:10.115
That doesn’t mean you do not look after it.

13:10.316 --> 13:14.574
It doesn’t mean that you don’t have
any sense of how you look

13:14.775 --> 13:19.799
and how you move about, because you
have to be decently dressed also.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.600
But attachment means that all the time
thinking,

13:24.801 --> 13:27.482
“This chakra is catching, that chakra
is catching,

13:27.683 --> 13:33.321
my head is catching, my Agnya is catching,
this is happening.”

13:33.585 --> 13:39.764
This is the subtler way how Sahaja Yoga
can ruin you, is this all the time thinking,

13:39.965 --> 13:44.031
“This is wrong, this is wrong”, condemning
yourself.

13:44.232 --> 13:46.447
So this detachment has to be there about
yourself,

13:46.648 --> 13:50.706
“No, doesn’t matter, so what, I’m like
a barometer.

13:50.907 --> 13:53.518
If I go near somebody and if I catch
well and good, you see,

13:53.719 --> 13:56.272
I’m just helping that person, well
and good.”

13:56.473 --> 14:01.470
Or you give yourself a bandhan and just
approach somebody.

14:01.671 --> 14:06.736
So worrying too much about your chakras
is not a very good thing

14:06.937 --> 14:12.595
for the progress of Sahaja Yoga. On the
contrary, you should try to meditate,

14:12.796 --> 14:17.988
don’t think of individual chakras, just
meditate with your heart.

14:18.189 --> 14:25.110
So now you will see from My lecture,
or whatever you call this,

14:25.311 --> 14:32.374
is that you have to have a heart which
is open to Sahaja Yoga.

14:32.575 --> 14:37.364
When your heart is open, first of all
you forgive yourself

14:37.565 --> 14:41.553
and you forgive others, and you don’t see
to your individual chakras

14:41.754 --> 14:46.965
or bother about others, in the way that
you are concerned

14:47.166 --> 14:53.004
about one individual, but you look
at the whole as a whole.

14:53.205 --> 14:57.848
You will then start talking about Sahaja
Yoga – “How is Sahaja Yoga spreading,

14:58.049 --> 15:01.104
how many people are getting realization,

15:01.305 --> 15:05.269
how much responsibility I have done,
I should”.

15:05.470 --> 15:07.914
“I have done” means not ego out of it, but,

15:08.131 --> 15:12.990
“I should do? What work can I do here?

15:14.016 --> 15:19.553
What mistakes we Sahaja Yogis have
committed that it has not worked out?

15:19.754 --> 15:25.050
What is the situation? How I can help?”.

15:25.251 --> 15:27.918
This kind of a, you see, sort of as if,

15:28.119 --> 15:31.774
like you really become a light and you
want to give light.

15:31.975 --> 15:34.379
So what’s wrong with the lamp which
is not giving light?

15:34.580 --> 15:42.649
But you don’t think about yourself, you
think as a body, the whole thing.

15:43.031 --> 15:49.093
This is the first thing is to open
your heart.

15:49.905 --> 15:58.887
As soon as you open your heart you will
widen yourself, you’ll grow.

15:59.507 --> 16:08.079
For that you need not condemn yourself but
opening your heart is – look at this ocean,

16:08.446 --> 16:14.202
how it is touching all the shores but it is
in itself, in its own maryadas.

16:14.403 --> 16:18.495
If you try to press the ocean from any side
it will show on the other side.

16:18.696 --> 16:23.034
You cannot press it. It has its height,
it has its limitations,

16:23.235 --> 16:26.244
it stays in its own limitations.

16:26.445 --> 16:30.515
So open-hearted person is like this,
it touches every shore

16:30.716 --> 16:34.446
but keeps to itself, to its own maryadas.

16:34.647 --> 16:39.683
So this understanding if it comes,
the expansion also is in such a manner

16:39.884 --> 16:43.524
that you do not go into individual corners
and individual places,

16:43.725 --> 16:49.460
but you keep to yourself and you touch
everyone.

16:53.901 --> 16:56.881
This is the opening of the heart when
we say.

16:57.082 --> 17:03.289
Then a Sahaja Yogi will have automatically
a proper discretion,

17:03.490 --> 17:11.591
discretion how far to say, how far not
to say, how far to go, how far to behave.

17:11.792 --> 17:15.097
Immediately you can find out a Sahaja Yogi
who tries to show off

17:15.298 --> 17:19.459
and wants to talk about something they
don’t know

17:19.660 --> 17:26.481
and gets hold of ten people around you
and talk about Sahaja Yoga.

17:27.952 --> 17:32.402
Anybody who sits round like that, never go
near that person.

17:35.450 --> 17:41.077
I discovered a horrible woman in England
who used to do that.

17:41.278 --> 17:48.260
And then she formed a group against
the whole system,

17:48.461 --> 17:58.032
but she caught hold of the leader itself and
all of them had to get out of Sahaja Yoga.

18:00.947 --> 18:07.816
So one has to understand that we have
to be simple people,

18:08.017 --> 18:13.522
not complicated. For that heart has to be
open –

18:13.723 --> 18:17.402
that’s all I can say, open your heart.

18:17.815 --> 18:22.070
Not, it’s not imaginary, it is a state
I think,

18:22.271 --> 18:31.139
in which you have to be stationed to be
self-satisfied.

18:31.776 --> 18:36.437
This is a very good way of approaching
Sahaja Yoga

18:36.638 --> 18:40.409
for yourself and for others.

18:42.568 --> 18:47.257
If you want Me to say – rather
embarrassing –

18:47.458 --> 18:51.215
but if you put Me in your heart, heart has
to increase

18:51.416 --> 18:57.196
because of My size, you see.
You can’t help it.

19:00.727 --> 19:03.403
It has to grow.

19:04.111 --> 19:07.176
So that’s the best, easiest way to do it,
you see?

19:07.377 --> 19:11.061
You are such lucky Sahaja Yogis that
I’m there with you.

19:11.262 --> 19:13.770
You don’t have to do anything. Put Me
in your heart, finished.

19:13.971 --> 19:17.893
You are all right now, no problem.

19:21.149 --> 19:27.249
Not that “I love you, Mother”, but is
the point is,

19:27.450 --> 19:30.847
“I put you in my heart.”

19:31.683 --> 19:40.936
But don’t ever think like this: “Mother
loves me, because I can cook for Mother,

19:41.137 --> 19:46.048
because I can look after Her sari, I can
press Her sari” - then it’s ego.

19:46.249 --> 19:48.775
The other way round becomes immediately
ego, I tell you.

19:48.976 --> 19:56.775
I didn’t know but there are instances of
this kind. Immediately it becomes an ego.

19:57.535 --> 20:02.188
But if you say, “How much I love Mother” -
just admire yourself -

20:02.389 --> 20:06.361
“Oh, I love Mother so much.”

20:06.570 --> 20:15.117
And you’ll feel very fine within your
heart, as so joy-giving.

20:15.483 --> 20:22.587
Imagine people who never had Me with them,
who came on this earth,

20:22.788 --> 20:27.006
had to fight for dharma, had to fight
for righteousness

20:27.207 --> 20:31.216
and for truth, how they must have fought.

20:31.417 --> 20:38.534
But I am before you, so it is, “How much
I love my Mother”.

20:40.115 --> 20:47.090
Is a very simple method, a basic method
for every Sahaja Yogi

20:47.291 --> 20:51.561
to discover oneself, and to develop
oneself.

20:58.150 --> 21:08.707
Then the discretion, the light, everything
just starts emitting.

21:08.908 --> 21:14.748
You see yourself in that light and you walk
in that light

21:15.691 --> 21:19.679
and people see that you have light.

21:23.308 --> 21:27.474
Now you are convinced about Me. You have
seen

21:27.675 --> 21:32.517
photographs, you have seen the sun,
the reaction, everything you have seen it.

21:32.718 --> 21:38.898
So now that you can love such a person,

21:39.686 --> 21:50.994
itself is a very big boon for us that we
love Mother.

21:52.696 --> 21:57.722
Even if you think that I have not yet said
“hello” to you,

21:57.923 --> 22:02.377
or sometimes I may not look at you – maybe.

22:03.601 --> 22:07.145
But it’s not Me – it’s you.

22:07.346 --> 22:11.562
I, in any case, love the whole world –
is no question!

22:11.984 --> 22:14.766
Nobody more, nobody less.

22:14.967 --> 22:18.539
But how far you are closer to Me depends
on you, you see,

22:18.740 --> 22:26.625
because I’m a fixed quantity. How far you
move towards Me is the point.

22:26.992 --> 22:30.119
I’m a fixed quantity and sometimes people
are amazed that,

22:30.320 --> 22:36.008
“Why Mother was not all right with us
this time?”

22:36.209 --> 22:42.421
Actually, I stand wherever I am, but you
have moved away.

22:42.622 --> 22:47.432
So all kinds of discretions start flowing
into you.

22:51.133 --> 22:56.434
Even you are convinced that I’m
the Adi Shakti

22:56.635 --> 23:03.597
and there are so many convincing facts
that you have – photographs are there,

23:03.798 --> 23:09.481
and all happenings are there, miracles,
everything, everything is there -

23:11.745 --> 23:18.268
still you are floating, floating on these
ideas

23:20.563 --> 23:26.577
that, “Oh, look at this, this is Mother’s
photograph, this is what has happened.”

23:26.778 --> 23:29.365
Still you are floating.

23:32.383 --> 23:36.453
If you really want to go deep down,

23:37.883 --> 23:41.783
you have to just feel your heart.

23:43.015 --> 23:46.035
There you’ll find the miracle.

23:46.236 --> 23:50.562
These outside miracles are to push you in

23:50.763 --> 23:55.646
and there you will grow, and grow in
a better way.

23:55.847 --> 24:01.758
That’s the only thing we have to find out
and discover.

24:01.959 --> 24:05.326
This will really help Sahaja Yogis who are
new, you see,

24:05.527 --> 24:10.218
when they will see how you love Mother.

24:11.275 --> 24:17.296
Yesterday only we had parked our car
in a funny way perhaps, maybe,

24:17.497 --> 24:22.700
and they were all about to quarrel
and fight Mr Guido.

24:22.901 --> 24:25.443
They might have beaten him, beaten him
also,

24:25.644 --> 24:27.007
but he said - “Why did you park here?”

24:27.208 --> 24:29.303
He said, “It’s my Mother who has come,
I’ve parked it here

24:29.504 --> 24:33.511
because my Mother can’t do this”, finished.

24:33.792 --> 24:40.813
As it is anybody who loves his mother, as
it is, is regarded something very good.

24:41.681 --> 24:44.510
Now the mother is horrid;

24:44.711 --> 24:49.188
still if you tell them, “My mother is
horrid”, people won’t like it.

24:49.389 --> 24:54.949
But you say that, “I love Adi Shakti.”

24:58.021 --> 25:02.441
[Shri Mataji: Who is it?
Yogi: Oh. Put him out.

25:02.642 --> 25:05.418
Shri Mataji: Who is he?
Yogi 2: What does he?

25:05.619 --> 25:07.232
Yogi: Mr Mauro (?) from Switzerland,
Shri Mataji.

25:07.433 --> 25:09.770
Shri Mataji: Eh?
Yogi: Mr Mauro from Switzerland.

25:09.971 --> 25:12.149
Shri Mataji: Who?
Yogi: Mr Mauro from Switzerland.

25:12.350 --> 25:16.056
Shri Mataji: Eh?
Yogis: Switzerland…

25:20.682 --> 25:22.554
Yogi: They came without asking.

25:22.755 --> 25:26.423
Shri Mataji: Put your hand on his heart,
doctor.

25:27.098 --> 25:32.269
See, this is how we help. He didn’t
understand what I was talking.

25:37.111 --> 25:39.854
Put your hand on his heart. Yogi: He never
should come without asking us.

25:40.055 --> 25:41.317
Shri Mataji: No, it’s all right, it will be
all right.

25:41.518 --> 25:46.520
Yogi: He should never come without
asking us. Shri Mataji: Is all right.

25:49.086 --> 25:52.368
(Aside) What to do, open the window.

26:01.711 --> 26:05.395
Open the window perhaps, maybe.

26:14.302 --> 26:19.323
Yogi: Yes. Are there certain modifications?
Shri Mataji: Eh?

26:34.007 --> 26:39.907
Correct, you are there. Is Nicholas, na?
Yogis: Yes.

26:40.108 --> 26:43.113
Shri Mataji: He is very good.

26:53.777 --> 26:56.919
Are you all right now?

27:04.188 --> 27:07.766
Absolutely, in the beginning if you pick
people up, you have to tell him

27:07.967 --> 27:14.086
just for the puja it’s too much vibrations
and too much for themselves to absorb.

27:14.287 --> 27:17.888
So you have to be careful. But this Nicholas
is all right, he has suffered so much

27:18.089 --> 27:24.593
that it’s good for him that he came
to the puja, must be about him.

27:28.689 --> 27:31.465
But now only you must choose people
who can come to puja;

27:31.666 --> 27:36.214
everybody can’t bear, you see, this is
too much of vibrations.

27:36.808 --> 27:41.912
But, you see, I know who can come very
easily [of them?],

27:42.113 --> 27:45.029
Very poor things - some of the seekers have
suffered so much

27:45.230 --> 27:51.062
that one puja can settle them down
completely.

27:53.581 --> 27:57.873
It’s all right now, see. Are you all right
now? Person: Yes.

27:58.074 --> 28:02.277
Yogi: He will never again. Shri Mataji: Eh?
Yogi: He will never again.

28:02.478 --> 28:06.399
Shri Mataji: He doesn’t enquire. You know,
you know you have a right.

28:06.600 --> 28:09.453
You are on the right path.]

28:13.055 --> 28:17.349
So we again go back to the same point
is of self-respect.

28:17.994 --> 28:24.932
When you reach that state of love,

28:25.133 --> 28:31.265
respect yourself, then you don’t condemn.

28:32.868 --> 28:36.327
“Because I love Mother, how can I do
such a thing that will bring

28:36.528 --> 28:43.949
bad name to Her? That’s not behooving
the way I should be.

28:44.149 --> 28:49.392
I have to behave in a way that My Mother
likes.”

28:49.942 --> 28:54.265
The whole all question is solved because
you have “Somebody” before you,

28:54.466 --> 28:58.607
and you know what I like and what I
don’t like.

28:59.231 --> 29:05.206
So always you’ll try to do things which
will be pleasing to Me;

29:05.407 --> 29:14.288
but actually it is not such a material
pleasing but is the essence of it,

29:15.577 --> 29:29.493
the essence of pleasing, and that if you
know what will make Me feel pleased…

29:29.694 --> 29:32.218
Actually, I get lost when I think about
My pleasing,

29:32.419 --> 29:36.697
I think, there’s nothing that pleases Me
or displeases Me.

29:36.898 --> 29:42.191
But maybe the Deities part of it, maybe
that part of Me, maybe that,

29:42.392 --> 29:48.006
because They always do things which
will please Me. They know.

29:48.207 --> 29:54.217
So in the same manner, if you can really
work it out,

29:54.799 --> 30:00.440
you’ll get that inner inspiration and
understanding.

30:04.050 --> 30:10.983
The essence of everything, we are
on the principle of it, the Tattwa.

30:11.184 --> 30:17.559
So the essence of everything if you catch…
“What is the essence of this?”

30:19.728 --> 30:23.344
Now put that test to anything.

30:29.520 --> 30:35.162
Just on the essence if you try to live,
the rest is looked after.

30:36.235 --> 30:39.589
So the self-respect, the essence of
self-respect is:

30:39.790 --> 30:43.630
“because I’m a Sahaja Yogi,

30:44.046 --> 30:49.310
because I have got Self Realization and
because I love my Mother”.

30:49.949 --> 30:52.732
This is the essence.

30:55.177 --> 31:06.377
If we can look to the essence of flowers –
why there are so many varieties?

31:08.046 --> 31:12.947
So many varieties of flowers, just see.
Just tremendous. Why?

31:13.148 --> 31:19.940
Because essence of beauty, the aesthetics
of beauty, is variety.

31:21.379 --> 31:26.304
Every leaf, if you take out each leaf

31:26.505 --> 31:33.073
it cannot be matched with anyone in the
whole world, exactly it will not be.

31:34.099 --> 31:39.831
So the essence of aesthetics is variety.

31:40.660 --> 31:44.257
So we have to have Sahaja Yogis
of different varieties,

31:44.458 --> 31:51.362
of different nature, of different humour,
to humour ourselves.

31:51.563 --> 31:55.315
We are not to have everybody just the same.

31:55.516 --> 32:03.292
But in the essence of it, all of them have
to love the Mother.

32:03.743 --> 32:07.915
Then the best of yours that you enjoy
the most,

32:08.116 --> 32:15.590
not the flowers so much, not the nature so
much, nothing more than other Sahaja Yogis.

32:15.791 --> 32:19.866
Once you start enjoying other Sahaja Yogis
and their company,

32:20.067 --> 32:22.876
then you have achieved it.

32:23.910 --> 32:30.384
I mean, imagine enjoying every human being
who is a Sahaja Yogi

32:31.759 --> 32:37.503
and their company, then it’s more than
sufficient. What more do you want?

32:37.704 --> 32:43.270
You don’t enjoy other people, you don’t
enjoy other things so much.

32:43.471 --> 32:48.445
But if you are in a beautiful place and
beautiful circumstances

32:48.646 --> 32:54.483
and you are with other Sahaja Yogis also,
then nothing like this.

32:54.684 --> 33:05.853
It becomes doubly enjoyable, I should say,
and every moment becomes an experience,

33:06.054 --> 33:11.357
every person becomes an experience,
is like a wave of joy.

33:11.558 --> 33:17.847
Every person you meet, every collectivity
you meet, every ashram you go to,

33:18.048 --> 33:23.315
it creates a beautiful wave in your heart
of joy.

33:24.928 --> 33:31.910
My joy is silent, but when I meet somebody,
then it shows itself up.

33:32.111 --> 33:39.535
It comes up like a wave or sometimes
as you see these drops from the ocean

33:39.736 --> 33:44.019
breaking on the shores, beautiful drops.
We call them tushhaar -

33:44.220 --> 33:48.625
in Sanskrit language there’s a beautiful
name for that, tushhaar –

33:49.811 --> 33:58.422
and then the waves go back to your heart.
So beautifully is the relationship

33:58.647 --> 34:04.039
and you just watch it as a witness and
see the joy.

34:05.969 --> 34:13.748
Then everything melts away, all your
knowledge so-called,

34:13.949 --> 34:18.604
all your pains, all your troubles,
all your past,

34:18.805 --> 34:25.688
all your future, but you remain in
the presence, in meditation,

34:25.889 --> 34:30.305
watching all this beautiful happening.

34:30.506 --> 34:38.657
May God all of you understand.
May God in all of you

34:38.858 --> 34:45.177
as Spirit emit that experience
all the time to all of you.

34:45.378 --> 34:48.421
May God bless you.

34:52.896 --> 35:01.902
This is the sari from Greece. Just see
that art of Greece expressed,

35:04.625 --> 35:07.055
beautiful.
Gregoire: It’s like the Aegean sea.

35:07.256 --> 35:12.612
Shri Mataji: Eh?
Gregoire: The water is like the Aegean sea.

35:15.311 --> 35:19.696
Shri Mataji: It’s beautiful. Like in
the sea you have

35:19.897 --> 35:25.976
blue and emerald, both colors, the same
way it is.

35:31.111 --> 35:35.425
So now, only today, because we have come
first time to Turkey,

35:35.626 --> 35:41.476
we’ll just have the establishment of Ganesha
and just wash My feet if possible;

35:41.677 --> 35:45.927
bring some plate, our plate is there.

35:46.128 --> 35:49.596
Gregoire: Shri Mataji, may I just read
a prayer at the beginning of the Puja?

35:49.797 --> 35:52.427
Shri Mataji: All right.

35:56.359 --> 35:59.488
Gregoire: So. Will we take three times
the mantra of Shri Ganesha

35:59.689 --> 36:04.543
and then I will read a prayer for
the beginning of this Puja.

37:20.985 --> 37:28.273
Gregoire: Shri Mataji, we bow before Thee
again and again.

37:29.142 --> 37:35.967
We celebrate this Puja in the old imperial
city called Constantinopolis,

37:36.168 --> 37:43.959
Byzantium and Istanbul, where Islam and
Christianity confronted each other,

37:44.160 --> 37:48.722
on the shores of the Bosphorus, the gateway
between Russia

37:48.923 --> 37:52.916
and the Mediterranean Sea between
north and south,

37:53.117 --> 37:58.786
at the place where Asia and Europe meet
between East and West.

37:58.994 --> 38:02.484
And as these two continents meet here,

38:02.685 --> 38:10.792
may two powerful desires of ours,
Thy children, meet in this Puja.

38:10.993 --> 38:15.304
One desire is for the salvation
of the seekers

38:15.505 --> 38:18.569
and the redemption of this world.

38:18.770 --> 38:24.481
One desire is for Thy welfare, well-being

38:24.682 --> 38:30.254
and good health of Thy earthly Incarnation.

38:36.764 --> 38:39.680
As Asia is bigger than Europe,

38:39.881 --> 38:47.024
so is the second desire of the yogis
much bigger than the first one.

38:48.543 --> 38:54.514
Shri Mataji, we know that Sahaja Yoga
has been born

38:54.715 --> 39:02.027
in the fire of Thy tapasya, is sustained
by the fire of Thy tapasya.

39:02.228 --> 39:08.099
We know that the cool fire of the Kundalini
is powered by the fire of Thy tapasya

39:08.300 --> 39:12.796
and we know, as the whole worlds and
the fourteen universes do,

39:12.997 --> 39:19.357
that Shri Shiva Himself was completely
overcome and conquered by Thy tapasya.

39:19.558 --> 39:22.504
But, Shri Mataji, now it is too much.

39:22.705 --> 39:30.918
The excruciating work and hardship that
Thou take on Thy physical body is inhuman.

39:31.119 --> 39:37.190
And as Thou do all this for us, we pray
now that

39:37.391 --> 39:41.695
as Sahaja Yoga was born in the fire
of Thy penance,

39:41.896 --> 39:47.280
it may now be sprinkled by the cool rain
of Thy satisfaction.

39:47.481 --> 39:52.714
That Sahaja Yoga may now grow through
Thee being prasanya.

39:52.915 --> 39:56.606
Shri Mataji, in the last decade of this
century,

39:56.807 --> 40:02.880
we pray that Sahaja Yoga will develop by
itself in the many countries of this world.

40:03.081 --> 40:12.870
We might for instance organize two or three
important international Sahaja Yoga camps

40:13.071 --> 40:16.623
where people will come from everywhere
as pilgrimage

40:16.824 --> 40:21.602
toward the place where Thou will reside,

40:21.803 --> 40:27.052
so that this punitive travel schedule
should definitely be alleviated;

40:27.253 --> 40:39.111
and we ask this because we are Sahaja Yogis
and because we have our Realization

40:44.548 --> 40:48.318
and because we love our Mother so much.

40:49.559 --> 40:52.864
Shri Mataji: Now his desire power is more,
that’s why he’s crying.

40:53.065 --> 40:56.799
Now let us see that, what our action power
is going to work out.

40:57.000 --> 41:03.010
Put yourself to action power. You see,
the action power when it takes over,

41:03.211 --> 41:07.451
it can be conquered with the desire power.

41:07.810 --> 41:12.593
I also fill so much sometimes with
the desire power

41:12.794 --> 41:19.446
that so much still to be done;

41:19.647 --> 41:25.518
and if you want Me to tell you about it,
you must know

41:25.719 --> 41:33.647
that all these rakshasas who came on this
earth, are known all over the world.

41:33.848 --> 41:36.112
Everyone has heard about TM.

41:36.313 --> 41:43.266
Everybody has heard about all kinds
of hoaxes.Think of it.

41:43.467 --> 41:47.534
People have not even heard about
your Mother.

41:48.257 --> 41:56.894
Now we’ve decided to put our declaration.
We have decided,

41:57.095 --> 42:00.620
but no newspaper will take it.

42:01.082 --> 42:05.151
But if that horrible Rajneesh who has said
that, “I’m a hoax

42:05.360 --> 42:08.002
and I’ve known how to make money

42:08.203 --> 42:12.704
and I’m untruthful and I’m a businessman”,
who has openly said it,

42:12.905 --> 42:17.924
but whatever he says everyday appears
in the newspaper in India.

42:19.426 --> 42:24.470
So when I put Myself onto the other side
of it,

42:24.671 --> 42:30.810
I feel that [a] lot of action still needs
to be done.

42:31.011 --> 42:39.117
Firstly, he has some people who are so
dedicated, surprisingly,

42:39.547 --> 42:44.735
and also they are paid by him because he
has made money, so it’s a vicious circle.

42:44.936 --> 42:47.535
He has made lots of money, he can pay
people,

42:47.736 --> 42:51.648
he can pay newspaper people, he can pay
his disciples so-called,

42:51.849 --> 42:55.761
and make them work for him. So it’s
a paid job.

42:55.962 --> 43:00.553
While Sahaja Yogis have to work on their
own.

43:00.873 --> 43:11.739
So to say that action power of Mine should
stop or should take rest,

43:11.940 --> 43:18.525
it will, when My desire will be fulfilled.

43:19.099 --> 43:26.414
So it has to be established. Still
in Turkey we are afraid a little bit.

43:28.940 --> 43:34.580
Nobody would accept it on the newspaper,
so we have to do something about it,

43:34.781 --> 43:38.785
so that all those who are lost with other
gurus, with other people,

43:38.986 --> 43:45.774
will just jump into it. People don’t even
know our name!

43:49.197 --> 43:53.046
It’s all right, you people have gained
a lot, you have all the enjoyment,

43:53.247 --> 44:00.829
you are all doing everything; but it’s not
yet recorded.

44:02.569 --> 44:05.210
We have to record it,

44:05.411 --> 44:11.317
for that whatever has to be done we cannot
give up, at any cost.

44:17.508 --> 44:20.136
This is the problem.

44:20.337 --> 44:24.523
So at least four years more I have to work
hard, I know that.

44:24.724 --> 44:30.882
As far as My body is concerned, I have
no problem.

44:31.123 --> 44:35.006
I’m eternally fed with energy,

44:35.207 --> 44:39.192
I don’t have problems, you don’t worry
about Me.

44:39.393 --> 44:44.397
I look like an ordinary human being,
I’m not.

44:49.007 --> 44:55.383
So don’t you worry. Be satisfied.

44:55.584 --> 44:59.536
I’m not in any way harmed, no one can
harm Me,

44:59.737 --> 45:03.903
no one can kill Me, nothing.

45:04.381 --> 45:08.955
But we have to establish, that’s important.

45:11.066 --> 45:21.031
Even a very ordinary person from India

45:21.249 --> 45:24.509
becomes well-known on the spiritual field,
just imagine,

45:24.710 --> 45:32.456
who has done no work, somebody hanging
in the air.

45:42.176 --> 45:53.494
So like I would say also that we have
to make sacrifices.

45:53.939 --> 46:00.984
As far as your feeling are concerned about
Me, that you don’t have to worry,

46:01.185 --> 46:03.695
you are all looking after Me very well.

46:03.896 --> 46:11.511
I’m overfed, not with food only but with
love and affection.

46:11.712 --> 46:15.913
But we have to still do very much,
that would do.

46:16.372 --> 46:20.270
So don’t you worry about Me, I’m perfectly
all right.

46:20.479 --> 46:26.956
Do I look tired to you?
Gregoire: No, Shri Mataji, not now.

46:32.381 --> 46:37.993
Yogi: Gregoire, Gregoire.
Shri Mataji: This is not recorded, is it?

46:38.919 --> 46:44.903
Yogi: It is on there, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: All right, camera is this on.

46:47.970 --> 46:56.111
[Hindi] Now, today [Hindi].

46:59.338 --> 47:04.467
Now today, you see, according to Hersh
is that in India,

47:04.668 --> 47:07.430
they don’t wash My hands but wash My feet.

47:07.631 --> 47:14.435
Yogi: We deserve to worship Your feet,
they do so much work, Shri Mataji…

47:14.910 --> 47:17.466
Shri Mataji: No, but moreover the vibrations
are much more there,

47:17.667 --> 47:19.783
I don’t know.
Yogi: Yes.

47:20.007 --> 47:23.306
Shri Mataji: Is said that [Sanskrit words],

47:23.507 --> 47:29.852
“from the Feet of such [a] person flows
the river Ganges”, you see,

47:30.053 --> 47:36.750
or the river of the Gods, you see.
So the Feet have that speciality.

47:36.927 --> 47:40.531
And imagine, the other day we did not do
this washing,

47:40.732 --> 47:44.425
so Hersh told Me that, “Let us do the Feet
washing”.

47:44.626 --> 47:48.966
And we did it in this pot which is made
of copper.

47:49.167 --> 47:52.651
And there was also some copper into it.

47:52.852 --> 47:57.592
The whole night it was kept with the copper,
and it gets poisonous.

47:57.793 --> 48:05.402
But nobody felt the poison. On the contrary,
vibrations improved.

48:08.569 --> 48:13.050
So the poison was neutralized.
Just like when Shiva

48:13.259 --> 48:16.158
drank all the poison and nothing happened,
in the same way.

48:16.359 --> 48:18.189
[Indian yogi comments:“We had once prepared
in Madras,

48:18.390 --> 48:25.613
I mean, in three hours it just –
(indistinct) – then Mother repeated this” -

48:25.921 --> 48:28.453
“Mother repeated”. (unclear)]

48:28.654 --> 48:31.931
Shri Mataji: Little bit… [Inaudible].

48:35.183 --> 48:41.993
Now you can say the Ganesha Atharva
Sheersha. Atharva Sheersha.

48:45.510 --> 48:49.714
If the people – if you try to remember
things by heart,

48:49.915 --> 48:55.852
even some songs will be good idea, so that
you needn’t have books.

48:57.707 --> 49:02.231
[Puja continues with Ganesha Atharva
Sheersha.]

53:32.234 --> 53:37.388
Shri Mataji: You can sing this song.
Yogi: "Ganesha Sthuti".

53:42.967 --> 53:47.700
[Sahaja Yogis sing “Ganesha Sthuti”]

01:04:34.146 --> 01:04:37.069
Shri Mataji: So, “Ai Giri Nandini”.
Yogi: “Ai Giri Nandini”.

01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:43.320
Shri Mataji: Vibrations is too much…
Vibrations is just so much.

01:04:46.163 --> 01:04:50.504
[Yogis sing “Ai Giri Nandini”]

01:12:38.573 --> 01:12:42.558
Shri Mataji: “Jogawa”, will you have this?
Yogi: “Jogawa”.

01:12:57.850 --> 01:13:02.175
[Bhajan “Jogawa” is sung]

01:24:15.948 --> 01:24:20.249
Shri Mataji: This song is composed
by Rajesh.

01:24:32.618 --> 01:24:37.023
[“Chalat Musafir” is sung]
