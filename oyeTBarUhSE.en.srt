1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:13,083
Today we are here to worship Shri Krishna within us.

2
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:27,076
As you know, that you all have been seeking
 before coming to Sahaja Yoga.

3
00:00:31,253 --> 00:00:46,480
You went to different places, read lots of
books, and also some of you were lost.

4
00:00:47,353 --> 00:00:54,321
And in that seeking, perhaps you did not know
what you were seeking.

5
00:00:56,575 --> 00:01:02,700
What you were seeking was to know yourself.

6
00:01:03,203 --> 00:01:07,675
In all religions it is said “Know thyself.”

7
00:01:07,858 --> 00:01:10,686
It’s a common thing all of them have said.

8
00:01:10,924 --> 00:01:17,654
This is one point which is absolutely there
in every religion, “Know thyself” –

9
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:23,580
 because without knowing yourself you will not know God.

10
00:01:23,773 --> 00:01:26,226
You will not know spirituality.

11
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:30,583
So the first step was to know yourself,

12
00:01:30,876 --> 00:01:36,942
 and that one people did all kinds of tricks with you,
they taught you in a different ways

13
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:43,984
and tried to actually loot you and cheat you.

14
00:01:44,135 --> 00:01:47,050
All those things have happened, is finished.

15
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:55,213
So then you come to Sahaja Yoga and you get
your Self-realization.

16
00:01:55,836 --> 00:02:08,424
Well, what is the purpose of Self-realization
is to know God, or the Goddess;

17
00:02:08,782 --> 00:02:14,041
that is the purpose of Self-realization.

18
00:02:15,215 --> 00:02:22,499
But after getting Self-realization, what should
happen to you?

19
00:02:23,412 --> 00:02:31,096
Many of you have lost interest in nonsensical
things like drugs and all those things;

20
00:02:31,323 --> 00:02:38,970
you have lost interest in reading also useless
books; you have lost interest

21
00:02:38,995 --> 00:02:42,562
 in other habits like drinking and all that.

22
00:02:42,877 --> 00:02:46,992
But that’s not enough, that’s not enough.

23
00:02:46,992 --> 00:02:51,274
That would happen in anyway.

24
00:02:51,502 --> 00:02:57,989
What has to happen by knowing God, is that
why does God wants you to know Him?

25
00:02:58,071 --> 00:03:03,221
Because He wants to see His reflection in you.

26
00:03:03,452 --> 00:03:09,653
He wants to see His reflection, that’s why
He has created you, and He wants to see His

27
00:03:09,653 --> 00:03:10,933
reflection in you.

28
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,722
Same with the Goddess.

29
00:03:12,722 --> 00:03:23,922
She has given you Self-realization because
She wants to see Her reflection in you.

30
00:03:23,922 --> 00:03:41,772
So you have to prepare yourself for that reflection,
which is so much purer, beautiful, loving,

31
00:03:41,772 --> 00:03:50,912
compassionate and above all, full of wisdom.

32
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:58,722
So this is the point one has to reach, where
you understand you have to have wisdom.

33
00:03:58,722 --> 00:04:06,632
If you are lacking in wisdom then you are
not a self-realized person.

34
00:04:07,793 --> 00:04:17,103
At the level of Shri Krishna, you see, He
wants you to become one part and parcel of

35
00:04:17,103 --> 00:04:24,543
the Virata – or the Viratangana, also wants
the same thing, that you should become part

36
00:04:24,543 --> 00:04:29,293
and parcel of the Virata.

37
00:04:29,293 --> 00:04:35,463
Not because you are realized souls now, so
you go about thinking you are perfectly all

38
00:04:35,463 --> 00:04:39,913
right, you don’t have to do anything about
it.

39
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:50,733
What do you do beyond this is the point, that
after Self-realization you have to see the

40
00:04:50,733 --> 00:05:03,874
reflection that should be within you from
the lives of these people like Shri Krishna.

41
00:05:03,874 --> 00:05:15,683
Shri Krishna was first born in a very difficult
situation, as you know, and He was carried

42
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:22,013
from there to Gokul, where He was brought
up by Yeshoda.

43
00:05:22,013 --> 00:05:30,663
Now there He started His playfulness.

44
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:38,243
So you have to be playful in life, you have
to create fun and joy.

45
00:05:38,243 --> 00:05:47,323
He didn’t say that you sit down like a old
sage somewhere in the Himalayas, but you mix

46
00:05:47,323 --> 00:05:54,713
up with children, you talk to them, you play
with them, have fun.

47
00:05:54,713 --> 00:06:02,003
At the same time He was destroying negative
forces which acted upon Him.

48
00:06:02,003 --> 00:06:07,463
In His playfulness only He has done it, as
a child only He has done it.

49
00:06:07,463 --> 00:06:14,553
How matured He was as a child you can see,
that He killed the Putana, and there are two

50
00:06:14,553 --> 00:06:18,454
horrible rakshasas also, He killed them.

51
00:06:19,026 --> 00:06:23,876
At the same time He was playing with the gopis

52
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:30,037
and teasing them, troubling them, making fun of them.

53
00:06:31,363 --> 00:06:32,560
Why?

54
00:06:32,585 --> 00:06:43,555
Because He wanted them to be playful; and
all kinds of celebrations He arranged.

55
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:53,103
He had once a big rain came, and He lifted
the complete mountain on His fingertips.

56
00:06:53,103 --> 00:06:59,273
That time these people should have understood,
it’s not possible, it’s a miracle.

57
00:06:59,273 --> 00:07:09,413
But He was just standing there with the one
finger at the mountain in a very simple, unassuming

58
00:07:09,413 --> 00:07:17,673
manner; He was doing all that to protect all
the boys who were playing with Him.

59
00:07:17,673 --> 00:07:27,423
Then He went and killed Kaaliya, the one who
was a big snake in the water.

60
00:07:27,423 --> 00:07:35,433
In the water this horrible fellow was creating
venom, and by which many people were killed.

61
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:49,023
It took Him no time and He jumped inside that
horrible water of Yamuna, from where He rescued

62
00:07:49,023 --> 00:07:58,803
in a way all the people by killing or hitting,
or you can say that by winning over this Kaaliya.

63
00:07:58,803 --> 00:08:03,890
But the wives of the big serpent, they asked Him

64
00:08:03,915 --> 00:08:09,279
that “Please forgive him,” and He forgave.

65
00:08:09,493 --> 00:08:17,903
All these things show a child of six, seven
years doing all these great things without

66
00:08:17,903 --> 00:08:24,783
feeling what He was doing, we can say that
without even thinking about it.

67
00:08:24,783 --> 00:08:31,623
But He achieved it, because He was aware that
He was Shri Krishna.

68
00:08:31,623 --> 00:08:37,653
So first thing, you have to be aware that
you are self-realized people.

69
00:08:37,653 --> 00:08:47,392
You are not ordinary people to behave in an
ordinary way, you are special people made

70
00:08:47,392 --> 00:08:54,373
specially to reflect the qualities of God
Almighty.

71
00:08:54,373 --> 00:09:00,322
It’s not expected that you go and kill Kaaliya.

72
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:08,023
But the situation is such today that you are
all the time protected.

73
00:09:08,023 --> 00:09:11,132
You are all the time protected.

74
00:09:11,132 --> 00:09:16,163
No one can harm you, no one can kill you,

75
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:23,492
and you can be looked after
because you are Sahaja yogis.

76
00:09:26,952 --> 00:09:31,301
Now what should be the attitude of a Sahaja yogi

77
00:09:31,475 --> 00:09:35,848
towards taking decisions, one should understand.

78
00:09:36,173 --> 00:09:44,782
It should be a spontaneous decision.

79
00:09:44,782 --> 00:09:50,493
You don’t have to tally it with this, go
there and find out – immediately, spontaneous,

80
00:09:50,493 --> 00:09:57,863
like Shri Krishna who jumped inside the river.

81
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:04,133
So in the same way you should have a very
spontaneous decision for anything.

82
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:06,332
Now you want to buy, say, a carpet.

83
00:10:06,332 --> 00:10:07,332
All right.

84
00:10:07,332 --> 00:10:13,592
You go in the shop and immediately you should
know which is the one.

85
00:10:13,592 --> 00:10:20,832
In every walk of life you should have a very
spontaneous decision, instant decision.

86
00:10:20,832 --> 00:10:26,293
But what I find, the style is very different.

87
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:34,332
They’ll go from shop to shop, then make
a list of it, then make all the measurements,

88
00:10:34,332 --> 00:10:39,712
then go home and say that “We’ll decide
it tomorrow.”

89
00:10:39,712 --> 00:10:44,613
That’s not the way a Sahaja yogi behaves.

90
00:10:44,613 --> 00:10:51,998
Sahaja yogi has to decide everything absolutely
spontaneously, at that moment.

91
00:10:53,673 --> 00:10:59,689
You should be like this: now somebody is getting drowned,

92
00:10:59,786 --> 00:11:04,557
so the first impulse should be that you have to save.

93
00:11:05,113 --> 00:11:08,633
And how do you save?

94
00:11:10,186 --> 00:11:15,572
You jump in the water – because you are
protected, nothing can happen to you,

95
00:11:15,687 --> 00:11:19,916
so just jump in the water and you’ll save the person.

96
00:11:20,273 --> 00:11:26,332
Minimum of minimum this should be your attitude,
this should be your temperament, that you

97
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:30,493
take a very spontaneous decision.

98
00:11:30,493 --> 00:11:41,522
All this thinking and all kinds of decision-making,
and having a big conference for decisions

99
00:11:41,522 --> 00:11:45,702
and all that – not needed.

100
00:11:45,702 --> 00:11:54,832
In day-to-day life also you have to be like
that.

101
00:11:54,832 --> 00:12:03,152
Also in every political life, economic life
or any other life you have to lead, you have

102
00:12:03,152 --> 00:12:08,553
to be very spontaneous.

103
00:12:08,553 --> 00:12:12,973
How do you become spontaneous?

104
00:12:12,973 --> 00:12:13,973
What quality you have got?

105
00:12:13,973 --> 00:12:21,822
What is the weapon you have got, to know what
decision to take?

106
00:12:21,822 --> 00:12:24,932
Do you know?

107
00:12:24,932 --> 00:12:30,892
You have got vibrations, you have the feel of the vibrations,

108
00:12:31,106 --> 00:12:34,803
and you know what vibrations are.

109
00:12:34,803 --> 00:12:40,322
You know what vibrations tell you, and convey
and communicate to you.

110
00:12:40,322 --> 00:12:42,762
They speak to you.

111
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:51,892
So through your vibrations you should know
in a second what should you do.

112
00:12:51,892 --> 00:12:57,733
For example now, somebody told Me that “Mother,
when I came to Cabella I felt tremendous vibrations.”

113
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:59,723
It’s a fact.

114
00:12:59,723 --> 00:13:04,803
But how many of you feel that way?

115
00:13:04,803 --> 00:13:09,743
Because your sensitivity is not yet developed.

116
00:13:09,743 --> 00:13:14,332
You have to be sensitive about your vibrations.

117
00:13:14,332 --> 00:13:21,882
You should know looking at anyone, sitting
next to anyone, even shaking hands with anyone,

118
00:13:21,882 --> 00:13:29,683
you should know what sort of vibrations that
person has.

119
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,603
This kind of sensitivity if you develop,

120
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:36,793
 then you will definitely take a very spontaneous decision.

121
00:13:36,793 --> 00:13:41,282
You know I am very good at it.

122
00:13:41,282 --> 00:13:49,032
I bought this Cabella in five minutes, really
five minutes.

123
00:13:49,032 --> 00:13:54,642
When I came here they said, “You can’t
go up, because You have big car.”

124
00:13:54,642 --> 00:13:58,433
So the Mayor said, “All right, come along,
I’ll take You in my car.”

125
00:13:58,433 --> 00:14:03,363
So I went with him on the car, on that car,
and I saw it.

126
00:14:03,363 --> 00:14:05,812
It was all dilapidated, no doubt.

127
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:16,142
It was all absolutely in a shambles, all right,
and looked like a ghostly place, no doubt.

128
00:14:16,142 --> 00:14:21,303
And everybody who was with Me, they said,
“Ah, what a place, Mother!

129
00:14:21,303 --> 00:14:23,883
You can’t buy that.”

130
00:14:23,883 --> 00:14:26,742
So I told the Mayor, “I am buying it.”

131
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:27,793
“When?”

132
00:14:27,793 --> 00:14:28,842
“Today.

133
00:14:28,842 --> 00:14:29,892
Now!”

134
00:14:29,892 --> 00:14:30,892
He was amazed.

135
00:14:30,892 --> 00:14:34,522
I said, “You tell Me, how do I buy?”

136
00:14:34,522 --> 00:14:36,322
He said, “Very easy.

137
00:14:36,322 --> 00:14:44,242
In this Italy You have to buy like this, that
You pay one-third of the price, all right?

138
00:14:44,242 --> 00:14:46,532
And then You can occupy.

139
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:52,383
If You find something wrong with the place
You can give up, but then You’ll not get

140
00:14:52,383 --> 00:14:53,383
Your money.

141
00:14:53,383 --> 00:14:57,592
But if the other fellow who is selling You
says no, then he has to pay double.”

142
00:14:57,592 --> 00:14:59,742
I said, “Very good bargain.

143
00:14:59,742 --> 00:15:00,742
I am buying.

144
00:15:00,742 --> 00:15:02,082
I have told you I am buying.

145
00:15:02,082 --> 00:15:04,163
I’ll buy.”

146
00:15:04,163 --> 00:15:08,442
And everybody was surprised what Mother was
doing.

147
00:15:08,442 --> 00:15:13,063
So what decided was the vibrations.

148
00:15:13,063 --> 00:15:15,353
Vibrations of the place just decided.

149
00:15:15,353 --> 00:15:16,642
I said, “Buy it.”

150
00:15:16,642 --> 00:15:22,712
That way they took Me to seven, I think, castles;
I said no.

151
00:15:22,712 --> 00:15:28,263
Outside only I could say no, and they were
surprised I didn’t even go inside.

152
00:15:28,263 --> 00:15:31,192
I said, “Ask them what was here.”

153
00:15:31,192 --> 00:15:33,462
They said, “Nunnery.”

154
00:15:33,462 --> 00:15:35,733
I said, “See?”

155
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:40,002
Now you should develop that kind of a spontaneous
decision.

156
00:15:40,002 --> 00:15:52,483
Then you will be amazed how in such a short
time you can really achieve such great things.

157
00:15:55,673 --> 00:16:00,168
But that doesn’t mean that you all should do that way;

158
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:04,353
first you should have that sensitivity of vibrations.

159
00:16:04,353 --> 00:16:07,146
If you have that sensitivity of vibrations,

160
00:16:07,178 --> 00:16:12,669
then I would say you are now matured in Sahaja Yoga.

161
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:16,258
So the maturity has to be brought in.

162
00:16:16,695 --> 00:16:22,756
You cannot just say, “Now it’s all right,
I have got Self-realization, I can do this.”

163
00:16:22,756 --> 00:16:27,856
First you tally your sense of sensitivity.

164
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:32,995
So now, how do you know?

165
00:16:32,995 --> 00:16:41,765
For example, you take a spontaneous decision,
you find that you have got nothing, it’s

166
00:16:41,765 --> 00:16:44,725
all nonsense – possible.

167
00:16:44,725 --> 00:16:52,445
But you can see for yourself that your decisions,
if they are spontaneous: if they fail, if

168
00:16:52,445 --> 00:17:03,796
they are wrong, if there are some mistakes
or that will make you suffer, whether economically,

169
00:17:03,796 --> 00:17:13,406
politically, in every way, then your whole
value system will be judged very well how

170
00:17:13,406 --> 00:17:25,616
far you have gone into Sahaja Yoga, how far
you have achieved your Self-realization, and

171
00:17:25,616 --> 00:17:31,806
where are you.

172
00:17:31,806 --> 00:17:34,526
This is what is the way to test yourself.

173
00:17:34,526 --> 00:17:43,376
You should not be afraid of failures, and
not get enamored by success, because you are

174
00:17:43,376 --> 00:17:44,906
self-realized souls.

175
00:17:44,906 --> 00:17:52,306
Of course, if you are sensitive, immediately
you will know what is it.

176
00:17:53,202 --> 00:17:56,163
Now of course, I wouldn’t say that

177
00:17:56,194 --> 00:18:00,056
you could have the same as I have, but you should try it.

178
00:18:00,056 --> 00:18:07,896
Now, I have seen some people will praise some
man, “Oh Mother, he’s so good.

179
00:18:07,896 --> 00:18:09,546
You must meet him.

180
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:17,146
He’s such a nice person and he’s of such
a help, and this will happen and that will

181
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:18,146
happen.”

182
00:18:18,146 --> 00:18:22,426
I said, “All right, you show Me a photograph.”

183
00:18:22,426 --> 00:18:28,813
I said, “I am sorry, I don’t want to meet
him.”

184
00:18:29,103 --> 00:18:31,923
They can’t understand.

185
00:18:31,923 --> 00:18:35,623
“Such a great man, he’ll be a minister
tomorrow.”

186
00:18:35,623 --> 00:18:39,039
“I don’t want to meet him.”

187
00:18:39,129 --> 00:18:45,439
And you find immediately, just next day, a
big report about him in the newspaper that

188
00:18:45,439 --> 00:18:50,469
he’s a very bad man.

189
00:18:50,469 --> 00:19:00,409
So you must tally your experience and your
understanding of what you have decided spontaneously.

190
00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:05,649
But still I would say, keep to spontaneous
decisions.

191
00:19:05,649 --> 00:19:13,209
Don’t think about it how it should work
out, what should we do.

192
00:19:13,209 --> 00:19:27,229
It has a very far-fetched influence on your
mind also that you see, that you know what

193
00:19:27,229 --> 00:19:29,939
is right and what is wrong.

194
00:19:29,939 --> 00:19:33,579
I don’t know how many of you have seen the
house I have built.

195
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:42,259
The another side of Shri Krishna was that
He was extremely creative.

196
00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:49,769
In His childhood He did all these things,
these pranks, and when He became a grown-up

197
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:55,389
person He became the king of Dwarika, of that
area.

198
00:19:55,389 --> 00:20:00,689
And He used to dress up like a king only – after
all, He was a king.

199
00:20:00,689 --> 00:20:11,169
When He was a child He used to wear a small
little piece of a feather from the peacock,

200
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:17,409
but when He became the king He was wearing
all the things, and He used to sit on the

201
00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:21,329
throne and talk to people in that manner.

202
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:29,049
All that greatness was there, and He was extremely
creative.

203
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:39,069
He built a beautiful, very, very beautiful
castle or you can say, palace in Dwarika,

204
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:43,109
out of gold – can you believe it?

205
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,729
Shri Krishna did it.

206
00:20:45,729 --> 00:20:48,819
And it was all then covered with water.

207
00:20:48,819 --> 00:20:55,119
Now the intellectuals in India, all trained
by Western people I think, said that it’s

208
00:20:55,119 --> 00:21:02,389
not possible, there’s nothing in the water
and He never built His palace there; it’s

209
00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:09,969
all a story just, just like a myth.

210
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:14,179
But some people believed in it, and they dug
up.

211
00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:19,019
They went down and they found there was a
very big palace.

212
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:23,159
There was gold little bit left, but not all
of it was there.

213
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:30,599
And they were amazed, such a huge, big palace
He had made.

214
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:36,089
Under the water it had gone, but it was there.

215
00:21:36,089 --> 00:21:43,989
Like this, all these incarnations who came
were extremely creative.

216
00:21:43,989 --> 00:21:48,709
If you are not creative, what’s the use
of Self-realization?

217
00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:54,829
Now, what is the greatest creative thing you
can do very easily is

218
00:21:55,054 --> 00:21:59,027
to make others Sahaja yogis.

219
00:21:59,699 --> 00:22:11,889
That is the easiest and most joy-giving thing,
is to make others Sahaja yogis and give them

220
00:22:11,889 --> 00:22:20,579
the blessings of the Divine, which they have
been seeking for ages.

221
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:27,919
By giving them, you don’t know what a solace,
what a blessing you give.

222
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:35,490
So now when you have got your Self-realization
– you got it very easily, I must say; they

223
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:45,759
all say that it is a instant nirvana, Sahaja
Yoga is instant nirvana, it’s true – but

224
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:53,219
whatever you get so easily and instantly,
you don’t understand the value of that.

225
00:22:53,219 --> 00:22:58,929
They always say for India that they got their
freedom so easily; they didn’t get it that

226
00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:00,429
easily, that’s why they do not value it.

227
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:13,239
But it is true, if you get anything free firstly
and without any special effort, then you don’t

228
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:15,299
value it, you don’t understand.

229
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:16,819
You think it’s a matter of right.

230
00:23:16,819 --> 00:23:21,369
But do you know how much people have suffered
for getting Self-realization?

231
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:29,329
They used to go on the Himalayas, stand on
one leg, sometimes on their heads for months

232
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:34,819
together, and they didn’t get realization.

233
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:44,409
I have heard of some people who lived in a
room for twenty-eight years to get Self-realization.

234
00:23:44,409 --> 00:23:48,739
And why they lived like that?

235
00:23:48,739 --> 00:23:55,449
Because they thought by keeping away from
other people, other bad atmosphere, everything,

236
00:23:55,449 --> 00:23:57,169
they might get realization.

237
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:01,489
They never got it.

238
00:24:01,489 --> 00:24:05,496
So one must understand, though you have got
it very easily,

239
00:24:05,521 --> 00:24:12,449
 it’s something so precious, so great.

240
00:24:12,579 --> 00:24:17,949
It’s not very easy to get Self-realization.

241
00:24:17,949 --> 00:24:28,079
You read about the people who are self-realized.

242
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:32,959
Perhaps they did not even know how they got
it, they did not know even about the kundalini,

243
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:39,419
but they got it, through their guru maybe,
maybe their efforts.

244
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:47,799
Buddha, how much He had to suffer till He
gets His realization – think of Him, how

245
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:50,399
He got His realization.

246
00:24:50,399 --> 00:25:00,469
I mean, you shudder to see of His life: ultimately
dies of hunger and poverty.

247
00:25:00,469 --> 00:25:03,619
But nothing happened to you.

248
00:25:03,619 --> 00:25:11,019
You have got it without any difficulties,
in a very sweet manner, all of you.

249
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:15,099
Nothing – you don’t have to pay, you don’t
have to do anything about it.

250
00:25:15,099 --> 00:25:22,729
But that doesn’t mean you should not value
it.

251
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:35,259
Like a seed which is put in the Mother Earth
spontaneously sprouts and gives life to the

252
00:25:35,259 --> 00:25:44,779
primule which grows, can grow into a shrub
and then into a tree.

253
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:54,089
But you have to put water in, and you have
to have the care of a gardener or someone.

254
00:25:54,089 --> 00:26:01,069
In your case, you are the one who has to do
all that.

255
00:26:01,069 --> 00:26:11,159
First of all you have to put the nourishment
of compassion and love.

256
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:14,279
Have you got that compassion and love?

257
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:18,399
Do you love people?

258
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:22,499
Like somebody told Me today – I was shocked
– “I don’t like children.”

259
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:24,419
I said, “You don’t like children?”

260
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:26,569
“No, I like others’ children, not mine.”

261
00:26:26,569 --> 00:26:35,199
Just imagine, how can you be doing that?

262
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:40,289
How can you say such a thing, you don’t
like your own children, anything?

263
00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:48,149
First of all, for all of you I would say that
you should never say “I like” and “I

264
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:49,289
don’t like.”

265
00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:50,989
These are anti-mantras.

266
00:26:50,989 --> 00:26:54,399
“I like this” – it’s very common.

267
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:56,099
Who are you?

268
00:26:56,099 --> 00:26:58,379
“I don’t like this carpet.

269
00:26:58,379 --> 00:27:00,349
I don’t like that silver thing.”

270
00:27:00,349 --> 00:27:03,459
Who are you?

271
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:06,449
Can you make one like that?

272
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:11,545
To take a decision of that kind is also shows

273
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:15,734
they think it’s very spontaneous – it’s not.

274
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:20,501
It has come from your conditioning, that you
think you have a right to say “I don’t

275
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:22,709
like, I don’t want.”

276
00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:26,709
But who are you?

277
00:27:26,709 --> 00:27:33,739
If you are the spirit you’ll never use these
words, because it might hurt somebody.

278
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:42,449
You’ll never say something that will hurt
others, you’ll never do anything that will

279
00:27:42,449 --> 00:27:50,619
be dangerous for others; but always you’ll
say something that would be extremely loving

280
00:27:50,619 --> 00:27:52,819
and compassionate, and peace-giving.

281
00:27:52,819 --> 00:28:00,419
You will emit joy for others.

282
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:08,839
There is the power of spirit, that it gives
joy to others.

283
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:14,519
If you are a glum person, grumpy person, then
you are not self-realized.

284
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:20,653
You should be able to give joy and love and compassion,

285
00:28:20,764 --> 00:28:26,954
and it should happen absolutely spontaneously.

286
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:40,769
There’s a story about a saint in India,
in Maharashtra.

287
00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:50,099
So they all used to take water in a container
called as kanwar, and would take it all the

288
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:55,429
way to Gujarat, to a temple of Shri Krishna.

289
00:28:55,429 --> 00:29:02,769
That was regarded as a great, you can say,
surrendering to Shri Krishna.

290
00:29:02,769 --> 00:29:08,379
So that saint also carried water in that container,
this kanwar.

291
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:19,459
All the way he carried it from his village
in Maharashtra, and when he reached the temple,

292
00:29:19,459 --> 00:29:33,309
at the foot of that temple he saw a donkey
very thirsty, dying out of thirst.

293
00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:40,079
So he gave that water to that donkey.

294
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:44,269
Everybody said, “Imagine, you brought this
water for miles together, for days together

295
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:52,539
to be put on the deity here, and now you have
given it to this donkey.”

296
00:29:52,539 --> 00:30:01,679
He said, “You don’t know, God has come
all the way down here to take the water.”

297
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:07,159
See the attitude that he took.

298
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:16,429
So for a self-realized person the compassion
should be like that, of very generous nature.

299
00:30:16,429 --> 00:30:23,729
If you are not generous, if you are miserly,
always worried about your money and saving

300
00:30:23,729 --> 00:30:32,509
of it, then firstly you are not a matured
Sahaja yogi – you are not.

301
00:30:32,509 --> 00:30:38,929
Apart from that, this kind of money will never
give you any happiness.

302
00:30:38,929 --> 00:30:42,569
Miserliness is against spirit.

303
00:30:42,569 --> 00:30:48,569
Spirit is extremely generous, extremely generous.

304
00:30:48,569 --> 00:31:02,719
It never strives to save something, or cheat
people or steal something – is out of question;

305
00:31:02,719 --> 00:31:08,759
because there is no greed left in it, there
is no greed at all.

306
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:16,409
And that is why such a person who is a realized
soul cannot be greedy,

307
00:31:16,638 --> 00:31:19,564
has to be extremely generous.

308
00:31:19,589 --> 00:31:28,669
I have seen many people like that who have
been extremely generous, and who have been

309
00:31:28,669 --> 00:31:33,329
very understanding about the problems of others.

310
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:39,519
While a Sahaja yogi will have his own problems,
he is not a Sahaja yogi at all.

311
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:48,189
He is there to solve the problems of others,
and not to solve his own problems and go about

312
00:31:48,189 --> 00:31:50,469
talking about it, “This is the problem I
have.”

313
00:31:50,469 --> 00:31:53,959
Now this is a new word that has developed
in modern times.

314
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:59,529
They never used to use the word “problem”
before, I tell you; only for geometry we used

315
00:31:59,529 --> 00:32:01,229
this word “problem.”

316
00:32:01,229 --> 00:32:04,319
But now it has started with a … “There’s
no problem.”

317
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:11,309
They are all in a problem, actually they are
problems, I think.

318
00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:18,139
So what you have to do is to understand that
you should not give your problems to others.

319
00:32:18,139 --> 00:32:25,059
You should not ask for anything, “Please
do this for me, please do that for me.”

320
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:37,579
It’s very surprising that people try to
sort of take advantage of others.

321
00:32:37,579 --> 00:32:42,679
Now some people like to visit some countries,
so they will ask you, “Please call me.

322
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:45,440
I would love to come to your country,”

323
00:32:45,512 --> 00:32:49,134
and a generous Sahaja yogi will say, “All right, come along.”

324
00:32:50,512 --> 00:32:55,099
Now, who is failing here is the person who
asked.

325
00:32:55,099 --> 00:33:03,089
You shouldn’t ask for anything whatsoever,
because you are complete.

326
00:33:03,089 --> 00:33:05,618
Not that only you are satisfied, but are complete.

327
00:33:05,618 --> 00:33:12,029
What can anybody give you?

328
00:33:12,029 --> 00:33:16,368
All desires just disappear when you are in
complete shape.

329
00:33:16,368 --> 00:33:19,959
Like today I was coming, I saw lots of stars
had come out.

330
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:24,779
I said, “As soon as the moon will come,
they’ll all disappear.”

331
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:38,499
In the same way, when you are complete, you
do not expect anybody to do anything for you.

332
00:33:38,499 --> 00:33:44,189
On the contrary, you want to find out what
you can do for others.

333
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:47,657
You become the others, in a way that whatever

334
00:33:47,683 --> 00:33:51,003
is the problem of others you take upon yourhead.

335
00:33:52,829 --> 00:33:56,009
You jump into it.

336
00:33:56,009 --> 00:34:04,179
It’s a very, very interesting growth that
should come in you.

337
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:13,059
It should happen to all of you, because you
have got your Self-realization.

338
00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:20,589
You develop a kind of a personality which
only lives for others, not for oneself.

339
00:34:20,589 --> 00:34:25,489
You will be amazed: you can live anywhere,
you can sleep anywhere.

340
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:29,649
You can have food, you need not have food,
whatever type of food you get it’s all right,

341
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:36,259
because you are so satisfied.

342
00:34:36,259 --> 00:34:44,269
On the contrary, you’d like to cook for
others, give them food, do whatever you like

343
00:34:44,269 --> 00:34:47,189
possible, you try to do.

344
00:34:47,189 --> 00:34:55,589
As long as you can work it out, you do it.

345
00:34:55,589 --> 00:35:01,439
But there are people who have only their own
problems.

346
00:35:01,439 --> 00:35:03,519
They are not Sahaja yogis.

347
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:11,449
How can the spirit have problems?

348
00:35:11,449 --> 00:35:15,649
How can that happen?

349
00:35:15,649 --> 00:35:24,999
So just understand that you are now the spirit,
and beyond everything.

350
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:31,339
So your creativity also goes to other dimensions.

351
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:35,999
Of course you start giving realization to
people.

352
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:38,519
You create art.

353
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:44,304
You know Baba Mama, he was very bad at literature and he was – well,

354
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:46,395
he didn’t know any language.

355
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:51,295
He was very good for mathematics, because
My mother was a mathematician, but language

356
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:53,079
he did not know.

357
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:55,730
I used to write his essays, he was so bad!

358
00:35:55,730 --> 00:36:01,339
But after realization he wrote such beautiful
poems.

359
00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:03,119
Unbelievable!

360
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,339
Nobody can believe this Baba could do that,
because he didn’t know any language well.

361
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:12,849
I used to write his essays, as I told you.

362
00:36:12,849 --> 00:36:22,289
So, amazingly, from where he started writing
Urdu poetry, Marathi poetry, Hindi poetry?

363
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:27,699
And one of My brothers asked him, “How do
you get this Urdu poetry?”

364
00:36:27,699 --> 00:36:31,418
He said, “Shri Mataji has, She tells me.”

365
00:36:31,418 --> 00:36:35,339
Everything he used to say, “Mataji tells
me.”

366
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:45,721
So the creativity within you is just flowers,
and you are amazed at yourself

367
00:36:45,746 --> 00:36:48,529
how this creativity has come in.

368
00:36:48,529 --> 00:37:00,079
Now imagine, for a person who is a mathematician
becoming suddenly a poet – I mean, it’s

369
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,629
impossible situation.

370
00:37:02,629 --> 00:37:04,349
And you have these capacities.

371
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:10,531
You have all these capacities that you can
become very creative,

372
00:37:10,556 --> 00:37:15,779
and you have to be creative in every way.

373
00:37:15,779 --> 00:37:22,294
I am very creative, I must say, I am all the
time working out something

374
00:37:22,563 --> 00:37:25,610
 which comes out very well.

375
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:33,769
And also I don’t have that interest as normally
people have, that it should be praised by

376
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:41,989
everyone or it should be, sort of, very much
in the newspapers and everything.

377
00:37:41,989 --> 00:37:44,639
No, no interest.

378
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:51,989
You create for creation, for the sake of creation
you create, and you just enjoy that creation.

379
00:37:51,989 --> 00:38:03,649
And you become very adaptable, or you become
so congenial with all the things people say,

380
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:08,989
talk – all right, let them do it.

381
00:38:08,989 --> 00:38:16,711
They will be offensive, or they could be also
praising you … you don’t know that they

382
00:38:17,522 --> 00:38:19,352
are praising you.

383
00:38:20,289 --> 00:38:23,539
Even sometimes when you “Shri Mataji ki
Jai!”

384
00:38:23,539 --> 00:38:32,659
– I also say, and then I forget they are
talking about Me.

385
00:38:32,659 --> 00:38:40,219
Somehow you are above all that, and you are
there, and you just don’t understand why

386
00:38:40,219 --> 00:38:47,119
human beings behave like that, why their behavior
is so funny.

387
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:54,099
Even when they come to Sahaja Yoga I see they
have a great desire to be leaders, or they

388
00:38:54,099 --> 00:39:03,656
have a great desire to be a great organizer
of Sahaja Yoga,

389
00:39:03,681 --> 00:39:06,423
to be very well-known in Sahaja Yoga.

390
00:39:06,471 --> 00:39:16,321
They want to have an international fame as
a great Sahaja yogi.

391
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:22,299
But they do not think that “What creativity
I have shown?

392
00:39:22,299 --> 00:39:26,199
What have I created?”

393
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:32,359
Just all these things are so common in human
beings that they always want others to praise

394
00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:44,139
them, to have a very big sort of a exposure
– of what?

395
00:39:44,139 --> 00:39:47,519
If you are a spirit, everybody knows.

396
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:54,949
What is there to expose, what is there to
show off, what is there to come forward?

397
00:39:54,949 --> 00:40:03,214
Even if you are at the back there is light,
you know there is light.

398
00:40:03,214 --> 00:40:11,339
So you have to get out of your darkness, because
you are the light and you spread light; instead

399
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:19,078
of if you are in the darkness, what light
can you spread?

400
00:40:19,078 --> 00:40:23,359
So your spirit cannot have problems.

401
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:27,999
It has no fear.

402
00:40:27,999 --> 00:40:37,879
But above all it has wisdom, tremendous wisdom,
and that wisdom is the one sign of you being

403
00:40:37,879 --> 00:40:40,469
a very higher personality.

404
00:40:40,469 --> 00:40:49,379
As I told you, this is evolution, and when
you are transformed you are evolved.

405
00:40:49,379 --> 00:40:58,139
Of a very different nature you become, and
you are to stand out.

406
00:40:58,139 --> 00:41:06,259
If Sahaja yogis are like other people, then
what’s the use of taking to Sahaja Yoga?

407
00:41:06,259 --> 00:41:07,699
What was Christ?

408
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:10,659
He was a son of a carpenter.

409
00:41:10,659 --> 00:41:16,349
He never got education.

410
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:19,199
But what did He do?

411
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:24,789
He was the Spirit.

412
00:41:24,789 --> 00:41:37,239
He reflected God within Him, and that’s
why He got Himself crucified also.

413
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:44,839
Now in Sahaja Yoga you don’t have to get
crucified, there are all not such testing

414
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:51,939
things for you, but your value system is to
be checked.

415
00:41:51,939 --> 00:41:58,859
You must find out how are you working out,
through introspection.

416
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:10,109
You should ask yourself, “So well now, Mr.
Sahaja yogi, how are you?

417
00:42:10,109 --> 00:42:14,831
Are you indulging into all these things that
these people

418
00:42:14,856 --> 00:42:18,902
who are not self-realized are doing?”

419
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:28,020
Just try to find out, because the growth of
Sahaja Yoga is shown in your behavior, in

420
00:42:28,139 --> 00:42:35,099
your styles, on your face.

421
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:45,929
There is no wrinkles on a person like this,
he has no worry; you don’t worry, then how

422
00:42:45,929 --> 00:42:48,389
will you get wrinkles?

423
00:42:48,389 --> 00:42:53,099
Such a person doesn’t get upset with anything.

424
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:59,589
I mean, on the contrary he laughs at things.

425
00:42:59,589 --> 00:43:11,260
Once in a church there was in Switzerland,
one lady came to hit Me with a Bible, and

426
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,279
I started laughing.

427
00:43:12,279 --> 00:43:17,289
I said, “What a thing, and I have to be
hit by a Bible!” you see.

428
00:43:17,289 --> 00:43:24,029
And she got such a fright that I was laughing,
and I was saying, “Look at this stupidity

429
00:43:24,029 --> 00:43:26,509
of this lady, coming to hit Me with a Bible!”

430
00:43:26,509 --> 00:43:32,589
I mean, I can understand stone or anything
else, but Bible will never hit Me.

431
00:43:32,589 --> 00:43:48,829
All these things have happened in your presence,
and you know about it.

432
00:43:48,829 --> 00:43:53,859
There are negative forces.

433
00:43:53,859 --> 00:43:55,379
They try to harm you.

434
00:43:55,379 --> 00:44:00,719
They will harm you bodily, they will harm
you mentally, they might harm you emotionally.

435
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:08,959
But when you are above this, then no one harms
you.

436
00:44:08,959 --> 00:44:14,639
At least you never feel the harm, you are
not bothered about the harm.

437
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:17,989
But what have you created?

438
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:24,959
Today I had some ladies and some men, and
all for divorce.

439
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:31,629
After getting married in Sahaja Yoga, they
want to have divorces, can you imagine?

440
00:44:31,629 --> 00:44:34,539
I was shocked.

441
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:38,529
And they had funny ideas that “my husband
is like my brother.”

442
00:44:38,529 --> 00:44:41,139
I said, “Really?”

443
00:44:41,139 --> 00:44:46,779
All kinds of stupid ideas coming into their
heads means there’s no light of the spirit

444
00:44:46,779 --> 00:44:48,039
in them.

445
00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:56,739
If you have light of the spirit, then your
understanding is very different.

446
00:44:56,739 --> 00:45:03,119
You don’t worry about yourself, you only
worry about others, and you try to find out

447
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:06,799
solutions for them.

448
00:45:06,799 --> 00:45:09,909
You try to help them.

449
00:45:09,909 --> 00:45:17,059
It is very easy for you.

450
00:45:17,059 --> 00:45:20,069
What is so easy for the light to burn?

451
00:45:20,069 --> 00:45:24,539
Once it is enlightened, it is burning.

452
00:45:24,539 --> 00:45:26,799
It’s difficult for it to go out of light.

453
00:45:26,799 --> 00:45:33,789
But for human beings, I can’t understand,
even after realization, after growing for

454
00:45:33,789 --> 00:45:41,509
years together they are still so stupid that
they don’t realize the value of their Self-realization.

455
00:45:41,509 --> 00:45:54,359
It is something, the spirit, you cannot kill
it.

456
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:55,899
It cannot blow off.

457
00:45:55,899 --> 00:46:02,059
This light will go off, but the light of the
spirit won’t go off.

458
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:11,619
But what is the oil that keeps it there is
your compassion, is love, care of others.

459
00:46:11,619 --> 00:46:17,059
I know there are people who are very, say,
dominating, may be troublesome, what else

460
00:46:17,059 --> 00:46:18,969
– but care for them.

461
00:46:18,969 --> 00:46:24,869
Know that they are not like you, they are
not complete, they have problems; so you care

462
00:46:24,869 --> 00:46:26,029
for them.

463
00:46:26,029 --> 00:46:30,259
But instead of that, you start thinking that
“Why should I care for him?

464
00:46:30,259 --> 00:46:31,359
How does he care for me?” or something.

465
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:34,219
Then you are finished.

466
00:46:34,219 --> 00:46:43,569
So this kind of a reflection, or I would say
the reaction, is not that of a spirit.

467
00:46:43,569 --> 00:46:48,489
A spiritual person’s reactions are very,
very different.

468
00:46:48,489 --> 00:46:57,178
In the life of Shri Krishna you can see that
He had a friend who was very poor, and he

469
00:46:57,178 --> 00:47:00,769
wanted to meet Shri Krishna.

470
00:47:00,769 --> 00:47:07,789
And the wife of the friend gave him some rice
crispies, as you call them, “And that’s,

471
00:47:07,789 --> 00:47:09,879
take for your friend.

472
00:47:09,879 --> 00:47:11,589
You must take something for your friend.”

473
00:47:11,589 --> 00:47:15,319
He was a little shy, you know.

474
00:47:15,319 --> 00:47:23,149
And when he went to Shri Krishna, Shri Krishna
was in His palace, and the people at the door

475
00:47:23,149 --> 00:47:25,019
said, “No, you can’t meet Him.”

476
00:47:25,019 --> 00:47:26,699
He said, “All right.

477
00:47:26,699 --> 00:47:31,379
You just go and tell Him that Sudama has come.”

478
00:47:31,379 --> 00:47:38,609
He was sitting on the throne discussing something,
and He said, “Sudama has come!”

479
00:47:38,609 --> 00:47:52,658
He rushed out and went to the door and hugged
him, hugged him again and again; and He said,

480
00:47:52,658 --> 00:47:56,689
“Why are you standing here?”

481
00:47:56,689 --> 00:48:07,419
He took him and put him on the throne that
He was supposed to, and He told His wives,

482
00:48:07,419 --> 00:48:10,908
“Please come and wash his feet.”

483
00:48:10,908 --> 00:48:14,009
And then they brought for him clothes and
all that.

484
00:48:14,009 --> 00:48:24,079
He had a bath; He made him sleep on His bed
– see the love of Shri Krishna.

485
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:28,829
He had very dirty feet, all were cracked.

486
00:48:28,829 --> 00:48:36,869
He tried to put on that some sort of a medicine
by which it would be all right.

487
00:48:36,869 --> 00:48:42,769
He tried to do whatever was possible to him
to cure those cracks.

488
00:48:42,769 --> 00:48:51,479
And He asked him to sleep on His bed, and
asked the ladies to fan him so that he doesn’t

489
00:48:51,479 --> 00:48:53,819
feel hot.

490
00:48:53,819 --> 00:49:01,769
See the compassion of Shri Krishna, it shows
so beautifully.

491
00:49:01,769 --> 00:49:05,329
Are we that compassionate?

492
00:49:05,329 --> 00:49:14,559
There was no need for Him to do that; it was
no drama, nothing – but His heart!

493
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:19,049
He took a spontaneous decision.

494
00:49:19,049 --> 00:49:23,509
When He heard Sudama is there, He just rushed
there.

495
00:49:23,509 --> 00:49:33,249
He just felt so happy that “My old friend
has come.”

496
00:49:33,249 --> 00:49:49,329
Then, when He went to Hastinapur, there the
Duryodhan, the Kauravas’ eldest son, he

497
00:49:49,329 --> 00:49:52,599
asked Him that “Why don’t You come and
stay in my palace?”

498
00:49:52,599 --> 00:50:02,168
He said, “All right, I can come, but you
see, I will go and have food with Vidur.”

499
00:50:02,168 --> 00:50:06,839
Vidur was a son of a maid.

500
00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:13,769
He went and had His food with Vidur.

501
00:50:13,769 --> 00:50:22,839
Now Vidur being a poor man, I don’t know
what food he must have given Him, while Duryodhan

502
00:50:22,839 --> 00:50:26,579
would have given Him such sumptuous food.

503
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:30,489
So for such people, taste and the level of
food and all doesn’t matter; it’s the

504
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:41,559
love, the respect of Vidur, who was a realized
soul – respecting other Sahaja yogis.

505
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:53,699
If a Sahaja yogi respects somebody who is
a governor – I can’t understand; the spirit

506
00:50:53,699 --> 00:50:59,519
is above everything else – and does not
respect a Sahaja yogi, there’s something

507
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:01,829
wrong with him.

508
00:51:01,829 --> 00:51:08,099
He should understand that this spiritual person
is higher than all these people who have these,

509
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:16,529
all kinds of these big names behind them.

510
00:51:16,529 --> 00:51:29,219
And that love is shown in everybody’s life:
all the saints, all the incarnations, everyone

511
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:39,418
had that love which was above everything else,
without expecting anything, not doing it just

512
00:51:39,418 --> 00:51:43,609
to expect something from them.

513
00:51:43,609 --> 00:51:54,339
It is a kind of a personality which really
reflects God’s love.

514
00:51:54,339 --> 00:51:56,739
That reflection should come from you.

515
00:51:56,739 --> 00:52:04,889
You are Sahaja yogis: that doesn’t mean
that you are something higher than others,

516
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:07,918
but you are different.

517
00:52:07,918 --> 00:52:10,949
You are above them.

518
00:52:10,949 --> 00:52:14,049
You have no superiority, that’s why you
are different.

519
00:52:14,049 --> 00:52:18,919
You are so humble, that’s why you are different.

520
00:52:18,919 --> 00:52:24,719
You are so joyous, you are so peaceful, that’s
why you are humble.

521
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:34,579
There are so many things I can tell you from
the life of Shri Krishna, showing He was,

522
00:52:34,579 --> 00:52:38,289
they call Him Yogeshwara.

523
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:41,219
He was a Lord of Yoga.

524
00:52:41,219 --> 00:52:47,139
It is because He was Virat.

525
00:52:47,139 --> 00:53:00,269
But He showed it, His form, only to Arjuna,
to nobody else, because nobody was like Arjuna.

526
00:53:00,269 --> 00:53:05,939
Arjuna also got a fright when he saw that.

527
00:53:05,939 --> 00:53:16,379
So He lived like Shri Krishna, like a cowboy
He was living in Gokul, and He never showed

528
00:53:16,379 --> 00:53:18,059
off His powers.

529
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:26,959
His powers were within Himself, which were
expressing spontaneously.

530
00:53:26,959 --> 00:53:37,709
This power has wisdom and discretion, complete
discretion.

531
00:53:37,709 --> 00:53:46,750
If it does not have then this is not divine
power, this is some satanic power: because

532
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:55,709
somebody is nice to you if you are nice to
that person, nothing doing.

533
00:53:55,709 --> 00:54:04,359
Mostly we had in India people who were called
as avadhutas.

534
00:54:04,359 --> 00:54:12,459
They were the realized souls who had gone
away from the society, from the multitudes,

535
00:54:12,459 --> 00:54:22,819
and gone and lived in some small little place
or some cave or somewhere, hidden from others;

536
00:54:22,819 --> 00:54:31,729
because they thought nobody is going to understand
them, so what’s the use of talking to them.

537
00:54:31,729 --> 00:54:38,279
They were singled out, one person here and
one person there.

538
00:54:38,279 --> 00:54:39,379
What could they do?

539
00:54:39,379 --> 00:54:45,309
They were not like you, so many of Sahaja
yogis together.

540
00:54:45,309 --> 00:54:49,719
You have so many friends and you have so many
others with you.

541
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:55,859
They were lonely people, and they hid themselves
from the society.

542
00:54:55,859 --> 00:55:02,219
They would not meet people, because if they
tried anything they would be crucified.

543
00:55:02,219 --> 00:55:08,329
But not you people, because you have a society.

544
00:55:08,329 --> 00:55:21,158
You have a beautiful enlightened society of
very good friends, of very good spiritual

545
00:55:21,158 --> 00:55:22,319
people.

546
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:31,759
With all this if you cannot create, then what
should I say?

547
00:55:31,759 --> 00:55:44,589
You have to create something: may be art,
may be music, may be poetry, may be literature,

548
00:55:44,589 --> 00:55:50,019
may be writing – whatever it is, you have
to create.

549
00:55:50,019 --> 00:55:54,168
And above all, you have to create Sahaja yogis.

550
00:55:54,168 --> 00:55:58,499
That’s the main creation you have to achieve.

551
00:55:58,499 --> 00:56:06,659
That’s the main thing you have to have,
is creating Sahaja yogis all over.

552
00:56:06,659 --> 00:56:13,589
And there I can go to places, can have programs,
do everything.

553
00:56:13,589 --> 00:56:22,039
But you have to show with your own example
that this is something great, how they have

554
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:28,499
achieved this state; we should achieve also
that state.

555
00:56:28,499 --> 00:56:40,658
So you will be the ones who will really inspire
them, who will really make them follow you

556
00:56:40,658 --> 00:56:45,309
and take to a life of a Sahaja yogi.

557
00:56:45,309 --> 00:56:54,339
Actually you are Mahayogis, if you become
complete – and you have to become.

558
00:56:54,339 --> 00:57:00,959
Nothing is more important than becoming a
Mahayogi, by which your spirit gives joy,

559
00:57:03,859 --> 00:57:09,499
peace and blessings to everyone.

560
00:57:09,489 --> 00:57:15,789
May God bless you.
