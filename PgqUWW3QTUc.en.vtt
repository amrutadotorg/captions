WEBVTT

00:08.880 --> 00:13.280
First, I will speak in Hindi language and then in English.

00:13.520 --> 00:17.160
We are such a cosmopolitan people

00:17.360 --> 00:20.920
that I don’t know what language to take to.

00:35.920 --> 00:39.440
[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi till 21:39 ]

00:41.062 --> 00:46.213
Today we are going to worship Shri Shiva.

00:47.709 --> 00:51.259
In the form of Shri Shiva,

00:51.460 --> 00:56.084
we have Shri Sadashiva himself,

00:56.285 --> 01:00.129
and his reflection, Shri Shiva.

01:12.450 --> 01:17.417
This Shiva's form in our heart

01:24.560 --> 01:28.380
always

01:28.581 --> 01:34.220
is sitting there in the form of the Spirit.

01:35.269 --> 01:38.820
I'm not saying it's enlightened there.

01:39.550 --> 01:45.457
When the Kundalini is awakened,

01:45.658 --> 01:50.985
this Shiva's form gets enlightened.

01:51.597 --> 01:58.104
And it gets enlightened in our nerves.

01:59.479 --> 02:02.610
It's said about Chaitanya that it sits on fat.

02:02.811 --> 02:04.482
First and foremost,

02:04.673 --> 02:12.300
its light comes to our brain.

02:14.857 --> 02:18.919
For the first time,

02:19.120 --> 02:24.050
our heart and

02:24.251 --> 02:29.217
our brain

02:29.418 --> 02:32.362
become integrated (unite).

02:32.942 --> 02:36.679
Otherwise, normally

02:36.886 --> 02:40.083
man's intelligence runs on one side

02:40.284 --> 02:44.870
and his emotions run on the other side.

02:48.291 --> 02:52.891
Due to this union,

02:53.092 --> 02:59.048
the light which inside us

02:59.249 --> 03:03.143
spreads from the Spirit,

03:03.344 --> 03:08.987
that light takes the form of vibrations and appears on our hands and

03:09.188 --> 03:14.286
on our fontanelle bone area.

03:14.937 --> 03:18.580
All of you know this.

03:18.866 --> 03:22.585
But, you should know that

03:22.786 --> 03:28.483
when this light comes into us,

03:28.684 --> 03:34.128
we see that gradually our life changes.

03:36.168 --> 03:39.586
All anger

03:39.787 --> 03:45.726
and six enemies within us are finished.

03:46.312 --> 03:49.794
Gradually everything drops out

03:49.995 --> 03:54.306
and faith establishes in the mind.

03:55.981 --> 03:59.875
From faith, wisdom gets awakened.

04:00.076 --> 04:04.387
Nothing will remain important.

04:06.667 --> 04:13.206
The personality of Shiva that we have seen

04:16.331 --> 04:21.585
is that of an angel,

04:21.807 --> 04:27.887
that of a great saint.

04:28.126 --> 04:31.020
He is like that.

04:31.537 --> 04:35.131
He doesn't care about anything.

04:35.332 --> 04:41.099
His hair are not properly done.

04:41.583 --> 04:43.091
Nothing.

04:43.321 --> 04:50.634
What he is wearing, what should be done, he doesn't think about it.

04:52.354 --> 04:57.771
He has given all this work to

04:58.009 --> 05:02.044
Vishnu.

05:02.346 --> 05:08.765
He wears tiger skin and roams around.

05:09.686 --> 05:16.399
And his vehicle is Nandi, who

05:16.600 --> 05:19.992
doesn't come under control in any way.

05:20.193 --> 05:22.402
It's not like horse that you can control.

05:22.603 --> 05:26.994
Wherever Nandi goes Shiva goes with it.

05:27.195 --> 05:34.253
He never thinks that what people will say.

05:34.454 --> 05:36.627
What will others think.

05:36.828 --> 05:43.473
If I dress like this and sit on Nandi, what will people say?

05:45.703 --> 05:50.311
Because he is contented within himself.

05:50.520 --> 05:54.693
He is sitting there with his own joy and happiness.

05:54.894 --> 06:00.916
He doesn't care about anything in this world that

06:01.117 --> 06:04.599
"what will people say?".

06:04.861 --> 06:07.893
He is not ashamed.

06:08.274 --> 06:12.522
You must have heard about his wedding.

06:12.723 --> 06:17.764
When he came for wedding,

06:17.965 --> 06:23.033
when Shri Vishnu saw him

06:23.256 --> 06:27.051
he said "who is this funny groom?

06:27.252 --> 06:30.878
How my sister is marrying him?"

06:31.093 --> 06:33.871
But Shri Parvati knew that

06:34.072 --> 06:39.602
her consort would be this, a happy-go-lucky person.

06:39.803 --> 06:41.883
He doesn't care about anything.

06:42.084 --> 06:45.008
When a person goes higher than everything,

06:45.199 --> 06:51.976
for him everything becomes unimportant.

06:53.808 --> 06:58.030
His attention won't go in this direction.

06:58.665 --> 07:02.020
This Shiva's incarnation that we see,

07:02.221 --> 07:05.768
looks very dear and beloved to us.

07:05.983 --> 07:12.803
And everyone thinks that all this done by Shri Shiva

07:13.004 --> 07:16.468
is very special.

07:18.357 --> 07:22.832
But, when Shiva's light comes into sahaja yogis,

07:23.033 --> 07:28.076
their life start changing too.

07:28.541 --> 07:30.658
I have seen that

07:30.859 --> 07:38.173
before they come to Sahaja Yoga,

07:38.374 --> 07:44.442
women, men also, liked good clothes very much.

07:45.451 --> 07:50.719
All their attention used to go on what to wear.

07:50.941 --> 07:53.649
And these days it's in fashion,

07:53.864 --> 07:59.619
because everywhere beauty clinics have opened,

07:59.866 --> 08:03.431
and women are badly stuck in these things.

08:03.876 --> 08:10.993
But when the beauty comes from the light inside you,

08:11.194 --> 08:15.501
then all these mundane things have no meaning.

08:15.742 --> 08:19.670
In the same way, comfort also,

08:19.871 --> 08:25.303
in a way, people look for the comfort of the spirit.

08:25.526 --> 08:31.078
They don't look for their personal comfort.

08:32.888 --> 08:35.568
See these foreigners.

08:35.799 --> 08:39.648
They live in big houses. They have cars and everything.

08:39.849 --> 08:43.182
But, they come here and just immerse in this atmosphere.

08:43.412 --> 08:46.312
But Indians are not like this.

08:46.653 --> 08:53.363
Wherever Indians go, they need attached bathroom,

08:53.564 --> 08:55.847
and all kinds of comforts.

08:56.069 --> 08:59.058
Till now they are not able to get over it.

08:59.272 --> 09:06.350
I'm astonished that in our poor nation they still have such desires.

09:07.367 --> 09:09.451
It's very astonishing.

09:09.652 --> 09:13.751
People told me Mother please buy a large land for ashram.

09:14.140 --> 09:17.566
Our Indians never live in an ashram.

09:17.767 --> 09:22.506
This ashram that we have made with so much of effort,

09:22.707 --> 09:24.976
nobody is ready to live in it.

09:25.191 --> 09:29.909
I said I will give you salary for staying, they said no.

09:30.110 --> 09:33.769
My birth place in Chhindwara,

09:33.970 --> 09:37.388
we spent so much for that house.

09:37.589 --> 09:40.267
I said those who have retired can stay there,

09:40.468 --> 09:44.923
it has very good climate, it's a hill station. No one was ready.

09:45.226 --> 09:48.568
Everybody thinks of their own comfort.

09:51.481 --> 09:56.375
It's not so with these people. They live very happily in ashram.

09:57.716 --> 10:02.200
My house, my place, my wife,

10:02.401 --> 10:07.217
food has to be cooked like this, we will eat this style.

10:07.418 --> 10:10.956
We are entangled in taste.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.422
They are not like this.

10:13.623 --> 10:16.751
They eat Indian food with interest.

10:16.952 --> 10:19.956
But I know when Indians come to Cabella,

10:20.157 --> 10:26.010
they will bring Indian breads, pickles, etc. with them.

10:26.495 --> 10:33.195
Because they can't get over their tongue. They are stuck in taste.

10:34.920 --> 10:41.625
So, until by meditating you don't get rid of these things,

10:44.254 --> 10:48.079
you can't go beyond Dharma.

10:49.246 --> 10:53.956
There is a small thing to understand that

10:54.157 --> 10:57.405
we lack in sacrifice.

10:57.858 --> 11:03.161
This time they said Mother has bought a huge land, spent so much,

11:03.378 --> 11:07.861
so for puja let's increase the costs.

11:08.357 --> 11:13.956
I received so many letters asking me to decrease puja money.

11:14.294 --> 11:19.688
Amazing! One time this puja is happening in Delhi.

11:19.889 --> 11:22.576
For that too so many letters about puja money.

11:22.777 --> 11:25.528
They are ready to eat 'paan' (beetle leaf) and throw it

11:25.737 --> 11:27.767
but won't pay puja money.

11:27.968 --> 11:33.015
I have never taken money from you, I have done everything on my own.

11:33.270 --> 11:35.737
But asking for such a small thing...

11:35.938 --> 11:39.723
See today half of the pandal is empty. Why?

11:39.924 --> 11:42.589
Because they don't want to give money for puja.

11:42.828 --> 11:46.804
They phone and ask me to exempt them from puja money

11:47.005 --> 11:50.480
Are you in a small job? No, it's not so.

11:51.011 --> 11:55.601
"My husband will pay, I won't pay."

11:55.855 --> 11:58.646
I'm amazed.

12:00.424 --> 12:03.901
If there were a strict guru,

12:04.102 --> 12:06.736
he would shave your heads,

12:06.937 --> 12:13.725
make you wear crimson color cloth and stand upside down on the head.

12:14.654 --> 12:18.829
But I don't want this, because it's about being spontaneous.

12:19.030 --> 12:22.141
Everything must come in that spontaneity (sahaj).

12:22.410 --> 12:25.713
In my life I have seen many sacrificing people.

12:25.943 --> 12:29.693
But I don't see it nowadays.

12:30.688 --> 12:32.328
I know about my mother,

12:32.529 --> 12:37.973
she would give away her sarees if they increased from six to seven.

12:42.317 --> 12:47.012
It's amazing, when they come to Cabella,

12:47.213 --> 12:49.363
they need separate room, separate house,

12:49.564 --> 12:52.770
they want to stay separate. Can't stay with others.

12:52.971 --> 12:56.741
The person who can't stay with others is not a yogi.

12:57.392 --> 13:01.223
He still thinks "I'm special, I must have special arrangement".

13:01.424 --> 13:04.169
He can't be a sahaja yogi.

13:05.716 --> 13:08.293
He is sahaja yogi by name.

13:08.494 --> 13:13.149
The one who is Shiva's disciple must be like Shiva.

13:13.372 --> 13:17.178
Wherever you make him sleep, sit, whatever you give him to eat,

13:17.379 --> 13:18.797
he doesn't care.

13:18.998 --> 13:24.076
He is not time-bound, no desires. He's like that.

13:24.277 --> 13:26.602
We can say he is a sahaja yogi.

13:26.803 --> 13:30.500
And Shiva's effect will be on you.

13:30.701 --> 13:36.346
People do so many things before achieving this.

13:36.672 --> 13:41.621
In any other place you go,

13:41.822 --> 13:48.009
they will snatch your money, pull your hair, and what not.

13:48.210 --> 13:50.811
It's not like this in Sahaja Yoga.

13:51.010 --> 13:56.147
But this temperament that we have, we must give it up.

13:56.569 --> 14:02.435
We must try to see what things we can give up.

14:04.486 --> 14:10.429
Unless this ecstasy comes in you, you can't be Shiva's disciple.

14:11.892 --> 14:17.162
Mother has all varieties of disciples, nothing special in it.

14:18.083 --> 14:23.234
All types of disciples. Whatever they do, think Mother will forgive.

14:23.435 --> 14:28.885
But by forgiving, you will not achieve that state.

14:32.036 --> 14:38.481
In forgiving, the most important aspect is to ask Shiva to forgive.

14:39.537 --> 14:41.740
All the time ask for his forgiveness.

14:41.941 --> 14:47.376
Because all the time we do a lot of things that we shouldn't do.

14:47.577 --> 14:53.349
We have to ask, "Oh Shambho, please forgive us". (Shambho=Shiva)

14:53.902 --> 15:00.686
We make many mistakes. We have many requirements.

15:01.246 --> 15:03.179
We want this and that.

15:03.380 --> 15:06.957
As long as there is 'I want' within us,

15:07.158 --> 15:11.168
until then you have to keep asking for forgiveness from God.

15:11.555 --> 15:15.719
And 'my', 'my house', 'my wife',

15:15.920 --> 15:20.962
this kind of authoritative behaviour that we have in us,

15:21.163 --> 15:26.407
unless and until we break this we can't be Shiva's disciples.

15:26.891 --> 15:32.103
It's astonishing that these foreigners have achieved so much of it.

15:32.477 --> 15:35.168
They had never heard his name.

15:35.359 --> 15:37.757
And we people are still stuck,

15:37.940 --> 15:41.249
and believe in it (his name only).

15:42.274 --> 15:44.479
Being Shiva means:

15:44.680 --> 15:50.768
All these worldly angles in us,

15:50.969 --> 15:53.726
whatever hatred is inside us,

15:53.927 --> 15:56.411
whatever hollowness we have in us,

15:56.562 --> 15:58.236
give them up.

15:58.467 --> 16:03.787
But people even after coming to Sahaja Yoga can't see themselves.

16:04.463 --> 16:08.497
I heard a mother-in-law is torturing her daughter-in-law.

16:08.759 --> 16:12.844
I asked her why she did it. She said "I have not tortured at all".

16:13.130 --> 16:14.714
Amazing!

16:15.000 --> 16:20.389
When they go to cinema and see this kind of torturing they cry.

16:20.639 --> 16:22.970
But when they come home they torture the daughter-in-law.

16:23.171 --> 16:25.515
Or the daughter-in-law tortures her mother-in-law.

16:25.716 --> 16:29.573
But they will say they have never tortured anyone.

16:29.865 --> 16:36.071
By keeping such lies inside you, you can't progress in Sahaja Yoga.

16:36.881 --> 16:40.490
Because this changes your life.

16:41.125 --> 16:44.544
It is your gold.

16:44.941 --> 16:48.016
And gold can't be tarnished.

16:48.217 --> 16:50.944
Nothing can color it.

16:51.145 --> 16:54.692
You have achieved that. Keep that state.

16:54.893 --> 17:01.689
Why to behave like slaves of worldly things now?

17:02.079 --> 17:08.743
This is the specialty of kundalini, that she cleans you completely.

17:10.354 --> 17:13.766
You should also serve others.

17:13.965 --> 17:16.613
But I don't need your service as such.

17:16.814 --> 17:20.205
I'm satisfied; what service can you give me?

17:20.459 --> 17:26.787
You should bring that satisfaction and joyfulness in you.

17:26.988 --> 17:30.673
You should think that everything is for enjoying.

17:30.874 --> 17:37.060
And if we're enjoying without doing anything, then what's the worry?

17:39.211 --> 17:44.210
After thinking a lot, I have come to this conclusion that

17:44.441 --> 17:49.010
Sahaja is very .........

17:49.257 --> 17:52.702
And that's why it's so difficult.

17:52.972 --> 17:59.918
If someone takes a stick in hand and tells you to shave your hair,

18:00.119 --> 18:04.770
wear ........, fast for 14 days,

18:05.008 --> 18:08.435
things will be all done.

18:08.641 --> 18:12.061
But Sahaja should be accepted from the heart

18:12.262 --> 18:18.320
and the mind,

18:18.535 --> 18:23.198
and correct oneself.

18:23.399 --> 18:28.980
"Why I'm acting this? Should I behave like this?"

18:29.181 --> 18:31.664
Many things will drop out by this.

18:31.903 --> 18:35.232
And in a way, you will find yourself.

18:35.433 --> 18:39.374
You are self-sufficient and you don't bother about anything,

18:39.575 --> 18:43.886
You don't desire anything. Sitting relaxed!

18:44.087 --> 18:47.150
And the surprising part is that

18:47.351 --> 18:53.666
when Chaitanya knows you don't need anything,

18:53.867 --> 18:57.229
it will give you everything.

18:57.430 --> 19:01.012
It may be for testing you, may be.

19:01.213 --> 19:03.957
Then it will see how you react.

19:04.251 --> 19:08.892
There is no need that it can't fulfill.

19:09.093 --> 19:13.743
But in this a little dedication is needed.

19:14.104 --> 19:21.081
Today, we have invoked Shri Shiva.

19:23.747 --> 19:27.316
But, he likes this type of people.

19:27.517 --> 19:29.580
The difference between him and me is

19:29.781 --> 19:33.538
I like all types of people and he doesn't.

19:33.822 --> 19:38.926
He likes the people who have left all these worldly things.

19:39.299 --> 19:45.314
These are peculiarities in us.

19:45.962 --> 19:49.454
In everything... in wearing clothes...

19:49.621 --> 19:52.795
What will happen if we don't wear like that?

19:54.139 --> 19:58.550
But, here we don't believe in asceticism.

19:58.751 --> 20:01.957
You will become an ascetic from within.

20:02.228 --> 20:09.404
When you are ascetic you become desireless and full of joy.

20:11.507 --> 20:14.499
Earlier there were Nath (=saint) people.

20:14.674 --> 20:18.393
They used to travel around the world.

20:18.594 --> 20:22.155
They gave a lot of teachings to the world.

20:22.481 --> 20:27.104
I was astonished to know where they had traveled to.

20:27.390 --> 20:33.311
When I went to Colombia, I came to know they had been to Bolivia.

20:33.748 --> 20:39.731
If you go to Colombia, in airplane you'll feel dizzy; it's so high.

20:39.969 --> 20:43.085
But in those days they used to go on foot.

20:43.315 --> 20:48.267
How did they reach there? I don't understand.

20:48.619 --> 20:53.900
In Russia and other countries around they have traveled.

20:54.146 --> 21:00.913
How they did it, where they stayed, what they wore; nobody knows.

21:01.691 --> 21:09.298
Because you get at the state where you become mysteriously powerful.

21:10.258 --> 21:14.002
For example, we know Sai Nath of Shirdi.

21:14.203 --> 21:18.754
He appears anywhere, he can come any time, he can help any one.

21:18.955 --> 21:24.478
People tell me "Mother we have seen him". I tell them "Yes why not?"

21:24.725 --> 21:27.433
Such people become immortal.

21:27.634 --> 21:32.328
Because what can kill them are finished, they become immortal.

21:32.638 --> 21:38.812
Achieving that immortality, is the actual worship of Lord Shiva.

21:39.360 --> 21:43.680
I am talking to them about Shiva’s worship -

21:43.960 --> 21:46.160
what should happen to you.

21:46.360 --> 21:48.560
But today, I am going to tell you about

21:48.880 --> 21:51.280
the internal happening within us

21:51.560 --> 21:54.440
when you get your Realization.

21:54.720 --> 21:59.760
There are eleven rudras placed here – eleven of them.

22:00.080 --> 22:04.240
They are particles, we can say, anshas they call it,

22:04.480 --> 22:07.439
of Shiva’s powers.

22:07.760 --> 22:13.600
And all of them try to take out

22:13.960 --> 22:19.600
or to remove all the false ideas we have about life.

22:20.160 --> 22:25.760
When the Kundalini rises, they all get enlightened - eleven of them.

22:26.120 --> 22:28.080
And, say for example,

22:28.280 --> 22:33.040
Buddha had a part of that, Mahavira had a part of that.

22:33.600 --> 22:39.240
Now, all of them, what they do is to control us

22:39.560 --> 22:44.160
from falling into the prey of various things.

22:44.480 --> 22:47.080
Like, we have an ego.

22:47.320 --> 22:50.760
So, Buddha will look after the ego part.

22:51.040 --> 22:56.360
He will see that you get shocked by your ego.

22:56.720 --> 22:59.000
You will be quite amazed

22:59.200 --> 23:03.320
how you could be so egoistical,

23:03.640 --> 23:08.520
and so insulting, and so humiliating.

23:08.920 --> 23:14.560
But when this rudra is not awakened,

23:14.840 --> 23:20.439
when there is no light in this rudra, then what happens?

23:20.760 --> 23:22.680
You start justifying yourself.

23:22.920 --> 23:25.080
You think whatever you do is correct,

23:25.360 --> 23:27.800
whatever you’ve done, whatever you’ve said,

23:28.000 --> 23:32.320
whatever you have achieved,

23:32.600 --> 23:34.520
you think is your right.

23:34.760 --> 23:36.800
You’ve done nothing wrong.

23:37.040 --> 23:43.040
For that, this Buddha’s rudra has to be awakened.

23:44.280 --> 23:48.640
On the contrary, if you go on pampering your ego,

23:48.920 --> 23:52.360
if you go on becoming egoistical,

23:52.600 --> 23:56.880
you become absolutely a right-sided personality.

23:57.160 --> 23:58.840
Once you are a right-sided personality,

23:59.080 --> 24:03.720
you know what all the symptoms there are of such a person.

24:03.920 --> 24:06.520
Now, for that if you just watch

24:06.760 --> 24:11.880
and introspect and see for yourself what ego has done to you,

24:12.160 --> 24:15.880
what wrong ideas you had about yourself.

24:16.280 --> 24:20.160
So that’s why Mohammed Saheb has said, “Beat yourself with shoes.”

24:20.520 --> 24:23.360
He didn’t know what else to tell.

24:23.600 --> 24:29.600
Because this ego business can really burst you,

24:30.000 --> 24:35.200
your head completely, and you may land up into so many difficulties.

24:35.440 --> 24:41.120
Ultimately, I have seen people developing this yuppie’s disease

24:41.400 --> 24:47.360
where the conscious mind becomes absolutely useless,

24:47.880 --> 24:50.040
cannot move.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.680
Consciously people cannot move.

24:52.920 --> 24:57.000
Unconsciously they will, but not consciously.

24:57.400 --> 25:00.600
And this disease is so horrible. A person becomes like a reptile.

25:00.840 --> 25:03.960
You have to carry them on your body. They can’t walk on their own.

25:04.200 --> 25:07.400
They can’t sit on their own.

25:07.960 --> 25:11.280
In a very young age this can happen. This is happening in America.

25:11.480 --> 25:14.320
Also, I have seen two, three cases here,

25:14.560 --> 25:16.760
in India, also such a thing happened.

25:17.000 --> 25:21.680
So if you do not try to see your ego and control it,

25:21.920 --> 25:25.920
and feel repentant about it.

25:26.880 --> 25:28.800
In Sahaja Yoga, there is nothing like repentance,

25:29.000 --> 25:30.600
we don’t believe in repentance.

25:30.800 --> 25:34.320
Because we believe that you all have got your Realization,

25:34.520 --> 25:39.440
you are beyond any mistakes. It’s not true.

25:41.400 --> 25:43.680
We have to repent.

25:43.920 --> 25:45.920
There’s a, in English, there is a word – sorry.

25:46.160 --> 25:47.640
Sorry, for everything they will say sorry.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.880
Even telephone if you pick up, they’ll say, “sorry.”

25:50.120 --> 25:53.240
I say, “Sorry, for what?”

25:53.600 --> 25:57.240
But this sorry itself is very empty.

25:57.440 --> 26:00.760
It has no meaning. It has no depth.

26:01.000 --> 26:05.160
When you say “sorry,” you have to see why you are saying “sorry,”

26:05.400 --> 26:08.000
and what is to be corrected.

26:08.240 --> 26:12.439
This is a very big problem of today’s generation

26:12.680 --> 26:15.960
where people have developed such tremendous ego-

26:16.160 --> 26:19.520
because all our economic growth,

26:19.760 --> 26:24.000
all our industrial developments,

26:24.320 --> 26:28.000
all our big, big organizations,

26:28.240 --> 26:32.840
all of them have given us a way

26:33.080 --> 26:35.320
that we should all develop our ego.

26:35.560 --> 26:39.920
If we don’t develop our ego we will be lost, we are nowhere.

26:40.160 --> 26:42.440
And that’s how we start pampering it,

26:42.680 --> 26:47.640
and then this right-sided problem starts.

26:48.960 --> 26:52.240
Then as a reaction, it goes to the left side.

26:53.120 --> 26:55.560
Actually, in the head it is on the right side.

26:55.760 --> 26:59.120
Here is the right side ego comes up,

26:59.360 --> 27:04.080
so the left rudra is that of Mahavira.

27:06.200 --> 27:11.000
So people do things, which are sinful,

27:11.880 --> 27:16.720
which are wrong, which are against Shri Ganesha.

27:17.920 --> 27:22.680
Then also there are controlling powers of Mahavira, who controls.

27:22.880 --> 27:25.960
He says, “You will go to hell; this will happen,”

27:26.200 --> 27:28.920
he describes all the hell, all kinds of hell,

27:29.200 --> 27:32.240
that you’ll go to hell and you’ll be burnt alive -

27:32.480 --> 27:36.640
I don’t know, all kinds of things He describes to frighten you.

27:37.120 --> 27:40.280
But that doesn’t help.

27:40.800 --> 27:44.480
So people start getting more onto the left side

27:44.720 --> 27:45.840
and, I should say,

27:46.080 --> 27:49.640
through this rudra, when this rudra gets helpless,

27:49.880 --> 27:53.720
then a tremendous depression comes in.

27:54.160 --> 27:57.600
One feels very depressed. “Oh God.

27:57.880 --> 28:01.840
What a depression I have.  I am so sick.  I am this thing.”

28:02.080 --> 28:07.280
And then you try to frighten others with your depressions.

28:07.720 --> 28:12.080
You show sort of a, what you call, an emotional blackmail you do.

28:12.520 --> 28:14.439
All kinds of things you will do,

28:14.640 --> 28:17.960
and beat your head and do all kinds of things.

28:18.200 --> 28:21.200
Could be through ego, could be through

28:21.400 --> 28:29.360
this left side problem of the left rudra.

28:29.840 --> 28:32.880
These two rudras are very important

28:33.200 --> 28:36.080
because they are directly connected with our

28:36.320 --> 28:40.040
left and right sympathetic nervous system.

28:40.320 --> 28:41.640
So, it’s very important to see

28:41.840 --> 28:46.520
that you don’t fall a prey to these rudras.

28:46.800 --> 28:49.720
These rudras are to be satisfied.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.840
So to be normal, at least look after these two rudras, which are:

28:55.040 --> 29:00.840
one is the one who controls the ego, and another is self-pity.

29:01.280 --> 29:05.720
“I just can’t do it, I’m this, that” and all kinds of depression.

29:05.960 --> 29:10.840
All this works out

29:11.080 --> 29:15.840
into, physically also, into very serious problems like cancer.

29:16.160 --> 29:19.600
If the rudras are caught up, you develop cancer.

29:19.800 --> 29:24.400
But all this portion gets swollen up.  It’s called as the medha.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.960
This all portion gets swollen up,

29:27.240 --> 29:31.840
and you can see a cancer patient having a swelling all over.

29:32.080 --> 29:35.040
At least would be here, or maybe there.

29:35.280 --> 29:38.640
Because such a swing in the nature of a person

29:38.920 --> 29:40.000
that you can’t say

29:40.240 --> 29:44.680
from which rudra they have developed these psychosomatic troubles.

29:44.960 --> 29:47.920
Psychosomatic troubles, all of them, come

29:48.120 --> 29:52.960
because the rudras have become ineffective.

29:53.400 --> 29:59.400
It can be due to the depressive nature

29:59.920 --> 30:03.600
or oppressive nature.

30:03.920 --> 30:07.120
It could be due to many other factors also.

30:07.320 --> 30:10.040
But all these factors are nothing

30:10.280 --> 30:17.640
but part and parcel of Shri Shiva’s,

30:17.880 --> 30:20.840
or Sadashiva’s powers.

30:21.120 --> 30:27.320
He is the one who is full of karuna - full of compassion.

30:27.520 --> 30:30.720
He is the ocean of compassion.

30:30.960 --> 30:34.200
If you ask Him forgiveness, He'll forgive.

30:34.440 --> 30:39.160
Whatever you do, instead of feeling guilty if you ask forgiveness,

30:39.400 --> 30:41.280
then He forgives.

30:41.600 --> 30:44.520
But if you think you, whatever you have done is good,

30:44.720 --> 30:49.920
you’ve never tortured anybody, you have never made anybody suffer,

30:50.360 --> 30:52.920
then it knows.

30:53.840 --> 30:56.160
Shiva knows everything, isn’t it?

30:56.439 --> 31:00.080
And, because it knows, it starts giving up.

31:00.320 --> 31:06.240
So there’s a big combination of your willpower

31:06.480 --> 31:11.080
to be there, and the combination of the blessings of Shiva.

31:11.360 --> 31:14.720
When the Shiva blesses you,

31:15.040 --> 31:18.080
your willpower also heightens.

31:18.320 --> 31:22.400
But you must have full willpower

31:22.760 --> 31:24.320
to know that you have

31:24.560 --> 31:30.240
to be of a higher level of personality.

31:31.080 --> 31:33.960
He was not at all a mundane type.

31:34.160 --> 31:35.480
I mean He was…

31:35.680 --> 31:39.320
supposing, ask Shiva to go to some party and all that,

31:39.520 --> 31:41.360
how will He look there?

31:41.560 --> 31:43.360
People will laugh at Him.

31:43.600 --> 31:44.800
When I met some hippies, I said,

31:45.000 --> 31:47.280
“Why are you having this kind of hair?”

31:47.520 --> 31:50.080
So they said, “We want to -” they are all primitive -

31:50.320 --> 31:52.200
so he said, “I want to be primitive.”

31:52.480 --> 31:53.920
I said, “But the brain is modern.

31:54.120 --> 31:57.920
What’s the use of having primitive hair?”

31:58.240 --> 32:03.240
So, deception. Deceiving yourself is not going to help.

32:03.440 --> 32:06.800
Best thing is to face yourself and understand

32:07.000 --> 32:09.760
what wrong you have been doing.

32:10.040 --> 32:11.560
If it works out, I tell you,

32:11.760 --> 32:14.560
so many Sahaja Yogis you are sitting here.

32:14.800 --> 32:18.200
If you correct yourself and become that

32:18.439 --> 32:22.040
I am sure all the problems - political, economic,

32:22.240 --> 32:26.080
and all stupid problems we have - will be finished.

32:26.400 --> 32:29.439
But today it’s such a mixture, due to Kali Yuga,

32:29.640 --> 32:35.600
that even the worst people are carrying on.

32:35.920 --> 32:41.040
Now, we have a responsibility to save this world.

32:41.280 --> 32:47.200
We have a responsibility to create a great, honorable life,

32:47.439 --> 32:50.560
which is not superficial, which is not just to show off.

32:50.760 --> 32:53.360
But inside it should develop

32:53.600 --> 32:59.560
so that this light of your spirit spreads

32:59.880 --> 33:02.240
and enlightens this world.

33:02.560 --> 33:04.680
It’s very important to understand

33:04.880 --> 33:06.560
all these troubles and these,

33:06.760 --> 33:09.560
I should say, diseases, psychosomatic diseases,

33:09.800 --> 33:14.080
and all other problems which are,in a collective way we can call,

33:14.280 --> 33:20.200
of the Kali Yuga like political, economic, all these problems -

33:20.440 --> 33:24.160
only are created by human beings.

33:24.520 --> 33:27.400
They're not created by the Divine Force.

33:27.640 --> 33:31.840
But Divine Force tries to neutralize them

33:32.120 --> 33:35.439
if there are many Sahaja Yogis

33:35.680 --> 33:40.840
who are practicing Sahaja Yoga in the real sense of the word.

33:41.440 --> 33:47.360
If that could be done, if that could be achieved,

33:49.400 --> 33:52.120
then I think we can do a lot,

33:52.360 --> 33:55.439
a lot for the betterment of humanity,

33:55.680 --> 33:57.800
and that’s why we have got realization.

33:58.080 --> 34:03.080
It’s not only for yourself, it’s not only for your family,

34:03.320 --> 34:05.320
it’s not only for your city or country,

34:05.520 --> 34:10.000
but for the whole world Sahaja Yoga is going to work out.

34:10.280 --> 34:12.280
Now, if you have to do competition,

34:12.520 --> 34:17.360
you must only do competition in your ascent and in nothing else.

34:17.600 --> 34:19.920
But people are so superficial

34:20.160 --> 34:22.800
that they think by showing off

34:23.000 --> 34:26.439
or by becoming something – a big Johnny -

34:26.760 --> 34:31.840
they will achieve something of a very great level, is not so.

34:32.320 --> 34:38.320
It has to be a very humble attitude towards yourself also,

34:38.920 --> 34:42.320
so that you understand that whatever you are doing

34:42.600 --> 34:44.200
is for the betterment

34:44.439 --> 34:50.200
of global problems.

34:50.560 --> 34:56.160
Absolutely we can solve because you are the channels of the Divine.

34:56.400 --> 34:58.360
If I could do it alone, I would have done it.

34:58.600 --> 35:01.880
But I can’t, so that’s why I had to gather you all

35:02.080 --> 35:05.120
and to tell you that you become all the channels.

35:05.320 --> 35:07.720
But in the meanwhile, you enjoy.

35:07.960 --> 35:13.360
You enjoy life. Every second becomes a joy,

35:13.640 --> 35:16.600
which is also the gift of Shiva.

35:16.840 --> 35:19.600
Shiva is the one who creates this

35:19.880 --> 35:22.960
great admiration

35:23.200 --> 35:28.400
and great appreciation of every moment,

35:28.640 --> 35:30.680
everything that is there.

35:30.960 --> 35:34.000
And that is the state we have to achieve,

35:34.200 --> 35:36.360
by not condemning yourself,

35:36.600 --> 35:42.560
or not by pampering your ego,

35:42.800 --> 35:45.560
but by seeing what you are.

35:45.840 --> 35:49.920
That’s the main thing one has to see, is what problem you have,

35:50.160 --> 35:54.240
and what is troubling you is yourself only.

35:54.640 --> 35:59.160
If you could just come to that point of understanding,

35:59.480 --> 36:02.800
I am sure, I am very, very sure

36:03.040 --> 36:07.520
that you will be such an asset

36:07.840 --> 36:13.800
to help to make this world look at itself and change.

36:14.040 --> 36:19.280
Because superficially you cannot change such deep-rooted problems.

36:19.480 --> 36:23.720
And, you are being so blessed by Kundalini

36:24.000 --> 36:29.800
that you can really become a great

36:30.240 --> 36:31.960
torch, I should say,

36:32.160 --> 36:38.080
torch on the path of truth, love and joy.

36:38.600 --> 36:43.520
May God bless you.

36:56.080 --> 36:58.880
Today first we'll have a short puja of

36:59.320 --> 37:00.720
Shri Ganesh

37:01.280 --> 37:03.120
and then of Shiva

37:02.560 --> 37:04.640
And lastly of the Goddess.

37:04.960 --> 37:07.760
We have little bit changed the sequence.
