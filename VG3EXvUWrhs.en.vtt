00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.167
Devi Puja, Patricia Deene’s House Gent (Belgium) 22-9-1982

00:00:11.367 --> 00:00:17.667
Shri Mataji's speech and subtitles start at 31:40

00:31:39.434 --> 00:31:43.367
This is the first time we are having a puja in Belgium.

00:31:43.701 --> 00:31:48.868
That’s very quick for a puja to be done like that.

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:53.567
Normally we don’t allow people to come to puja

00:31:53.667 --> 00:31:57.367
unless and until they are established Sahaja yogis.

00:31:57.868 --> 00:32:04.634
Because sometimes if they are half-baked, it harms them more

00:32:05.033 --> 00:32:11.801
in the way that they start doubting and thinking about it.

00:32:12.267 --> 00:32:14.834
But in the puja you should stop thinking,

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.601
do not doubt, do not think,

00:32:18.067 --> 00:32:20.801
then you have the best advantage out of it.

00:32:21.133 --> 00:32:25.067
As far as I’m concerned,

00:32:25.968 --> 00:32:31.868
my chakras start working sometimes with a great force.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.767
Say if Gavin does puja, he is such a great Sahaja yogi

00:32:34.834 --> 00:32:40.300
that the deities can start emitting lots of vibrations.

00:32:40.834 --> 00:32:43.300
But if you are not in the receiving mood,

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:47.000
then it takes time for me to take out the vibrations

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:52.167
in the atmosphere or in another awareness.

00:32:52.534 --> 00:32:57.901
So it becomes more difficult for me to have a puja, because sometimes

00:32:58.234 --> 00:33:04.167
I do suffer with overflowing vibrations which you cannot suck in.

00:33:04.701 --> 00:33:10.534
So today as we have ventured to have this puja for all of you,

00:33:11.067 --> 00:33:16.500
please try to receive, humble down yourselves in your hearts.

00:33:16.634 --> 00:33:23.334
Only through your hearts you can receive the blessings of this puja.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.500
It's a very higher state when you can do that,

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:38.667
but it's alright with Sahaja yoga, they are aware, all the deities

00:33:38.834 --> 00:33:43.467
that you are still children, you can make mistakes

00:33:43.901 --> 00:33:49.133
and you are seekers and you are especially blessed by me.

00:33:49.701 --> 00:33:52.901
It's not difficult in India because the one who raises the kundalini

00:33:53.067 --> 00:33:57.868
like this of masses of people definitely establishes me

00:33:58.033 --> 00:34:01.033
in their hearts, that I’m the primordial Mother.

00:34:01.167 --> 00:34:04.834
Because it's written in so many books so they don’t have this problem.

00:34:05.133 --> 00:34:08.067
While here people have not heard about Holy Ghost and

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.868
it’s a secret for them and they just can’t understand.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.901
It is impossible to explain to them.

00:34:13.167 --> 00:34:16.534
If someone says I’m God, and all that, then they are enamored.

00:34:16.834 --> 00:34:19.467
Openly if somebody declares I’m God.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.467
But that should not be in Sahaja Yoga, we should have an inner circle.

00:34:24.801 --> 00:34:28.868
Only these people should start growing, then others should follow.

00:34:29.167 --> 00:34:34.567
It should not be exposed to everyone, it won’t help much

00:34:34.701 --> 00:34:38.300
and to me also it doesn’t give pleasure

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:42.667
because the vibrations are not sucked in and

00:34:43.267 --> 00:34:47.367
I have to carry the load upon myself for quite some time

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:52.500
till I deliver it to the atmosphere.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.234
So it’s a very different system we have.

00:34:56.601 --> 00:35:01.767
We seldom allow people to join us in the puja, only people

00:35:01.868 --> 00:35:07.267
about whom we are convinced that they are alright we allow them.

00:35:07.534 --> 00:35:11.200
So though it’s a hasty one today we have done I’m sure

00:35:11.334 --> 00:35:16.334
you people in Belgium will try to receive more don’t think about it.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:19.334
Just expose your body to it,

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:22.734
expose your mind to it and get as much as possible.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.334
Because I think now in Belgium I will be here

00:35:25.367 --> 00:35:27.367
only after a year or so, not before that.

00:35:27.868 --> 00:35:30.267
But you all can come to London some time.

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:34.033
There’s a puja now, there’s a very good puja of Navaratri.

00:35:34.267 --> 00:35:39.033
We must have one big puja for Navaratri in London itself

00:35:39.601 --> 00:35:43.300
and I think it not very far away, you people can come for that puja.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:49.667
That's the beginning of the nine days,

00:35:50.334 --> 00:35:55.500
nine incarnations of the Goddess when she came on this earth

00:35:55.834 --> 00:35:58.901
to kill the demons and the devils

00:35:59.133 --> 00:36:04.434
who were troubling the devotees and the seekers and

00:36:05.133 --> 00:36:09.567
one has to also know about that part of knowledge, it is very important.

00:36:09.734 --> 00:36:12.734
These books, luckily some of them are translated.

00:36:13.167 --> 00:36:16.701
If you go through them then it will be easier for you to understand.

00:36:17.067 --> 00:36:22.067
As I told you that India is the root and you are the shoot,

00:36:22.367 --> 00:36:25.300
so the knowledge is more known to Indians,

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.300
as science knowledge is known to you,

00:36:27.434 --> 00:36:30.234
knowledge about God is known to them.

00:36:30.901 --> 00:36:33.400
And so there should be no harm in learning about it

00:36:33.467 --> 00:36:36.734
because you are all seekers you are not scientists.

00:36:36.934 --> 00:36:39.934
You are seekers of the science of God.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.367
So the best thing is to get this into yourselves, open up yourselves,

00:36:44.667 --> 00:36:47.634
receive the blessings by which you grow.

00:36:47.767 --> 00:36:51.834
It’s like sunshine to the plants.

00:36:53.467 --> 00:36:54.968
May God bless you. Don’t think.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.567
As it is I have stopped your thinking,

00:36:56.667 --> 00:37:01.167
but try to receive as much as possible with humility.
