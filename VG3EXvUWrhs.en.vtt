00:00.000 --> 00:11.167
Devi Puja, Patricia Deene’s House Gent (Belgium) 22-9-1982

00:11.367 --> 00:17.667
Shri Mataji's speech and subtitles start at 31:40

31:39.434 --> 31:43.367
This is the first time we are having a puja in Belgium.

31:43.701 --> 31:48.868
That’s very quick for a puja to be done like that.

31:49.100 --> 31:53.567
Normally we don’t allow people to come to puja

31:53.667 --> 31:57.367
unless and until they are established Sahaja yogis.

31:57.868 --> 32:04.634
Because sometimes if they are half-baked, it harms them more

32:05.033 --> 32:11.801
in the way that they start doubting and thinking about it.

32:12.267 --> 32:14.834
But in the puja you should stop thinking,

32:15.400 --> 32:17.601
do not doubt, do not think,

32:18.067 --> 32:20.801
then you have the best advantage out of it.

32:21.133 --> 32:25.067
As far as I’m concerned,

32:25.968 --> 32:31.868
my chakras start working sometimes with a great force.

32:32.100 --> 32:34.767
Say if Gavin does puja, he is such a great Sahaja yogi

32:34.834 --> 32:40.300
that the deities can start emitting lots of vibrations.

32:40.834 --> 32:43.300
But if you are not in the receiving mood,

32:43.500 --> 32:47.000
then it takes time for me to take out the vibrations

32:47.300 --> 32:52.167
in the atmosphere or in another awareness.

32:52.534 --> 32:57.901
So it becomes more difficult for me to have a puja, because sometimes

32:58.234 --> 33:04.167
I do suffer with overflowing vibrations which you cannot suck in.

33:04.701 --> 33:10.534
So today as we have ventured to have this puja for all of you,

33:11.067 --> 33:16.500
please try to receive, humble down yourselves in your hearts.

33:16.634 --> 33:23.334
Only through your hearts you can receive the blessings of this puja.

33:24.000 --> 33:30.500
It's a very higher state when you can do that,

33:31.100 --> 33:38.667
but it's alright with Sahaja yoga, they are aware, all the deities

33:38.834 --> 33:43.467
that you are still children, you can make mistakes

33:43.901 --> 33:49.133
and you are seekers and you are especially blessed by me.

33:49.701 --> 33:52.901
It's not difficult in India because the one who raises the kundalini

33:53.067 --> 33:57.868
like this of masses of people definitely establishes me

33:58.033 --> 34:01.033
in their hearts, that I’m the primordial Mother.

34:01.167 --> 34:04.834
Because it's written in so many books so they don’t have this problem.

34:05.133 --> 34:08.067
While here people have not heard about Holy Ghost and

34:08.300 --> 34:10.868
it’s a secret for them and they just can’t understand.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.901
It is impossible to explain to them.

34:13.167 --> 34:16.534
If someone says I’m God, and all that, then they are enamored.

34:16.834 --> 34:19.467
Openly if somebody declares I’m God.

34:20.000 --> 34:24.467
But that should not be in Sahaja Yoga, we should have an inner circle.

34:24.801 --> 34:28.868
Only these people should start growing, then others should follow.

34:29.167 --> 34:34.567
It should not be exposed to everyone, it won’t help much

34:34.701 --> 34:38.300
and to me also it doesn’t give pleasure

34:39.100 --> 34:42.667
because the vibrations are not sucked in and

34:43.267 --> 34:47.367
I have to carry the load upon myself for quite some time

34:47.500 --> 34:52.500
till I deliver it to the atmosphere.

34:53.000 --> 34:56.234
So it’s a very different system we have.

34:56.601 --> 35:01.767
We seldom allow people to join us in the puja, only people

35:01.868 --> 35:07.267
about whom we are convinced that they are alright we allow them.

35:07.534 --> 35:11.200
So though it’s a hasty one today we have done I’m sure

35:11.334 --> 35:16.334
you people in Belgium will try to receive more don’t think about it.

35:16.400 --> 35:19.334
Just expose your body to it,

35:19.400 --> 35:22.734
expose your mind to it and get as much as possible.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.334
Because I think now in Belgium I will be here

35:25.367 --> 35:27.367
only after a year or so, not before that.

35:27.868 --> 35:30.267
But you all can come to London some time.

35:30.500 --> 35:34.033
There’s a puja now, there’s a very good puja of Navaratri.

35:34.267 --> 35:39.033
We must have one big puja for Navaratri in London itself

35:39.601 --> 35:43.300
and I think it not very far away, you people can come for that puja.

35:43.400 --> 35:49.667
That's the beginning of the nine days,

35:50.334 --> 35:55.500
nine incarnations of the Goddess when she came on this earth

35:55.834 --> 35:58.901
to kill the demons and the devils

35:59.133 --> 36:04.434
who were troubling the devotees and the seekers and

36:05.133 --> 36:09.567
one has to also know about that part of knowledge, it is very important.

36:09.734 --> 36:12.734
These books, luckily some of them are translated.

36:13.167 --> 36:16.701
If you go through them then it will be easier for you to understand.

36:17.067 --> 36:22.067
As I told you that India is the root and you are the shoot,

36:22.367 --> 36:25.300
so the knowledge is more known to Indians,

36:25.400 --> 36:27.300
as science knowledge is known to you,

36:27.434 --> 36:30.234
knowledge about God is known to them.

36:30.901 --> 36:33.400
And so there should be no harm in learning about it

36:33.467 --> 36:36.734
because you are all seekers you are not scientists.

36:36.934 --> 36:39.934
You are seekers of the science of God.

36:40.000 --> 36:44.367
So the best thing is to get this into yourselves, open up yourselves,

36:44.667 --> 36:47.634
receive the blessings by which you grow.

36:47.767 --> 36:51.834
It’s like sunshine to the plants.

36:53.467 --> 36:54.968
May God bless you. Don’t think.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.567
As it is I have stopped your thinking,

36:56.667 --> 37:01.167
but try to receive as much as possible with humility.
