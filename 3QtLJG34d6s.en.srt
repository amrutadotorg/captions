1
00:00:32,362 --> 00:00:37,875
Today I will tell you the importance
of puja.

2
00:00:41,072 --> 00:00:44,479
[To the Spanish translator: “You could
take this” (microphone).]

3
00:00:58,648 --> 00:01:10,336
Even among the early Christians,
they used to do the puja

4
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:23,337
of the adoration to the statues, maybe,

5
00:01:23,538 --> 00:01:34,241
or maybe the photographs, or, we can say,
the stained glass copies

6
00:01:34,442 --> 00:01:38,217
of the Mother and Christ.

7
00:01:53,632 --> 00:01:58,862
But later on, people started becoming
more rational

8
00:01:59,063 --> 00:02:05,428
and they did not understand what is
the importance of puja.

9
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,020
And when they could not explain it,

10
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:23,980
they gave up doing pujas in that regular
manner.

11
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:37,144
Even before Christ, they used to have

12
00:02:37,345 --> 00:02:41,728
a particular type of a tabernacle, which
was measured

13
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:48,919
and was specially made and a puja place
was created to worship –

14
00:03:03,537 --> 00:03:10,680
to worship what they call Yahovah.

15
00:03:15,774 --> 00:03:22,668
Now this Yahovah in our Sahaja Yoga
is Sadashiva,

16
00:03:29,517 --> 00:03:35,492
and Mother Mary is Mahalakshmi.

17
00:03:37,516 --> 00:03:42,245
She incarnated before also.

18
00:03:44,105 --> 00:03:48,863
She incarnated as Sita,

19
00:03:50,374 --> 00:03:56,362
and then She incarnated as Radha,

20
00:03:56,681 --> 00:04:01,989
and then She incarnated as Mother Mary.

21
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,277
Now it is clearly written about the birth
of Christ

22
00:04:07,478 --> 00:04:12,603
in a book called Devi Mahatmyam.

23
00:04:20,937 --> 00:04:26,546
He was the son of Radha.

24
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,830
Radha is the Mahalakshmi,

25
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:44,606
so He was born in another state, as an egg,

26
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:52,089
and half of the egg remained
as Shri Ganesha

27
00:04:52,290 --> 00:05:01,345
and half of it became Mahavishnu,
which is our Lord Jesus Christ.

28
00:05:10,865 --> 00:05:14,993
All the description about Jesus Christ

29
00:05:15,194 --> 00:05:22,709
is given in that Mahavishnu’s description,
exactly the same.

30
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:39,223
Now this Mahalakshmi came on this earth
and She brought forth Her child

31
00:05:39,424 --> 00:05:41,836
with immaculate conception,

32
00:05:42,045 --> 00:05:48,130
which She had done before also, as Radha.

33
00:06:03,953 --> 00:06:14,691
So, the Christ is the son of the great
being of the Virat.

34
00:06:20,783 --> 00:06:27,748
Actually Vishnu, Mahavishnu, Vishnu
becomes the Virata.

35
00:06:36,846 --> 00:06:40,915
Now this Vishnu Tattwa becomes Virata

36
00:06:41,116 --> 00:06:47,028
and also He becomes Rama and Krishna

37
00:06:55,473 --> 00:07:00,152
and then the Virat, means the Akbar.

38
00:07:03,886 --> 00:07:15,981
So Christ is the Omkara itself,
is the vibrations itself.

39
00:07:22,466 --> 00:07:31,486
All other incarnations had to take
the principle

40
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:36,511
or the essence of the Mother Earth
to create their body,

41
00:07:36,712 --> 00:07:42,929
except for Christ’s body, which is
absolutely Omkara.

42
00:07:57,786 --> 00:08:05,279
And the earth element of that being
is Shri Ganesha.

43
00:08:12,296 --> 00:08:21,184
So we can say that Christ is the power
of Shri Ganesha which incarnated.

44
00:08:27,263 --> 00:08:34,658
So He – that’s the reason He could walk
on the water.

45
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:44,088
So He is the purest form of Divinity,

46
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:50,388
because He is just vibrations.

47
00:08:53,203 --> 00:09:01,027
So when you do puja to Me,

48
00:09:01,228 --> 00:09:07,552
because I’m in person, there is nothing
unreal.

49
00:09:18,588 --> 00:09:22,144
If they had done puja to Christ -

50
00:09:22,345 --> 00:09:30,058
they must, they have done puja to Christ
also when He lived and to His Mother.

51
00:09:36,678 --> 00:09:44,470
It is said that in the Ten Commandments
whatever is created by the heavens

52
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:53,894
and by the earth should not be re-created
and re-produced and worshipped.

53
00:10:03,453 --> 00:10:09,615
So the incarnations are created
by the heavens.

54
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:24,845
Only in modern times it is possible to take
a photograph of the incarnation.

55
00:10:33,302 --> 00:10:38,264
But in the former days there was
no possibility.

56
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:47,978
Now whatever is created by the Mother Earth

57
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:53,430
is what has come out of the Mother Earth,

58
00:10:57,707 --> 00:11:01,209
which is the swayambhu,

59
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:05,865
is created by the Mother Earth.

60
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:13,325
Now we have everywhere, we find
the swayambhu things.

61
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:26,221
Another thing is, some realised souls also
have made beautiful statues.

62
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:43,086
I went to Portugal and they had a festival
of the Lady of the Rocks.

63
00:11:48,182 --> 00:11:53,709
So I went to see that place

64
00:11:53,910 --> 00:12:01,486
and there was a very small little statue
of this dimension, height of the Mary,

65
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:06,183
about say, five inches, at the most.

66
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:17,146
And the face was just like Mine,

67
00:12:18,844 --> 00:12:22,254
exactly like Mine.

68
00:12:22,455 --> 00:12:29,484
And they said that this was found suddenly
by two children

69
00:12:29,685 --> 00:12:38,273
who were following a rabbit which hid
inside a niche.

70
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,814
So these children saw some light
inside the niche

71
00:12:53,015 --> 00:12:58,794
and they started following under a rock,

72
00:13:03,602 --> 00:13:10,305
and they reached the source of the light,
was this statue. They brought it out.

73
00:13:14,488 --> 00:13:16,334
And in that light they walked,

74
00:13:16,535 --> 00:13:19,720
and when the people outside, were lots
of people were gathered,

75
00:13:19,921 --> 00:13:25,894
they were amazed to see that they brought
out the statue from somewhere inside.

76
00:13:38,405 --> 00:13:44,803
So they worship that statue in that place.

77
00:13:48,445 --> 00:13:54,448
Now, these statues give you vibrations,

78
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:02,407
as I give you vibrations,

79
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:06,000
but not so much

80
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:09,568
as I give you.

81
00:14:10,243 --> 00:14:13,786
And all the other statues also, there
may be many,

82
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:17,926
who might be giving you vibrations.

83
00:14:21,392 --> 00:14:25,560
Also in India, as you know, you went
some of you to Ganapatipule,

84
00:14:25,761 --> 00:14:29,317
where it is the Ganesha which has come -
Mahaganesha, that is Christ -

85
00:14:29,518 --> 00:14:33,965
has come out of the Mother Earth,
Mahaganesha.

86
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:47,474
So the lower portion of the body
you see there,

87
00:14:47,675 --> 00:14:52,352
and the head is the whole of the mountain.

88
00:15:00,363 --> 00:15:07,463
And there the water of the sea is
also sweet,

89
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,530
and there are many sweet water wells there.

90
00:15:20,995 --> 00:15:24,265
If you remember, a photograph of Mine
was taken there,

91
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:28,040
many people took photograph.

92
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:38,106
And in some photographs, in My heart
there’s a light coming out.

93
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:45,467
And some told Me that some photographs
which did not have the light,

94
00:15:45,668 --> 00:15:55,460
but when they re-took, I mean the negatives
were again taken as a photograph,

95
00:15:55,682 --> 00:16:01,264
and again they took a photograph with that,
then the light came in there.

96
00:16:14,696 --> 00:16:19,713
So, one must know that in the realm
of Divine

97
00:16:19,914 --> 00:16:24,878
there are all kinds of miraculous things.

98
00:16:34,312 --> 00:16:37,765
Same is the puja.

99
00:16:38,106 --> 00:16:45,463
Now when we do the puja, first of all
you will praise Shri Ganesha.

100
00:16:48,671 --> 00:16:56,873
By that, in you, Shri Ganesha will be
awakened and established.

101
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:10,259
By worshipping Me as Shri Ganesha,
your innocence will be established.

102
00:17:18,317 --> 00:17:20,851
And you will see, the vibration-wise also,

103
00:17:21,052 --> 00:17:29,960
your vibrations will increase and you will
feel very stable within yourself.

104
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:45,796
Now when you will take Shri Ganesha’s
names you will know what qualities He has,

105
00:17:49,696 --> 00:17:53,455
what powers He gives you.

106
00:17:54,054 --> 00:17:56,271
When you praise those qualities,

107
00:17:56,472 --> 00:18:03,348
those powers of those qualities will
start emitting through you.

108
00:18:14,058 --> 00:18:17,815
This is how the Divine works,

109
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:24,680
as if you get charged with those qualities.

110
00:18:28,687 --> 00:18:34,991
Then you praise the Goddess, the Adi
Shakti.

111
00:18:38,855 --> 00:18:46,495
Now the Adi Shakti has all the seven
chakras within Her awakened,

112
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:55,289
and She has to work with all these seven
chakras.

113
00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:00,588
For the first time such an incarnation
has come.

114
00:19:05,637 --> 00:19:08,302
It’s like you make first one room, then
second room,

115
00:19:08,502 --> 00:19:11,861
then third room, seven rooms, and then
the whole house is done,

116
00:19:12,062 --> 00:19:16,432
you get the keys and you open, the house
is yours.

117
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:37,455
That is how I could achieve Self-
realisation en masse.

118
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,746
It could not happen earlier,

119
00:19:53,654 --> 00:20:01,488
but now possible, because of this
combination of all the seven chakras.

120
00:20:07,593 --> 00:20:13,445
So now when you are praising the Adi
Shakti, I’m also a Mahamaya,

121
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:16,607
that I look like you, I behave like you,

122
00:20:16,808 --> 00:20:18,694
I have made Myself exactly like you -

123
00:20:18,895 --> 00:20:23,011
very difficult to make, but I have.

124
00:20:44,361 --> 00:20:48,371
And this body has to bear lots of things

125
00:20:48,572 --> 00:20:58,309
to make you understand Sahaja Yoga
and your own powers.

126
00:21:09,086 --> 00:21:12,435
For example, you are - if you are rude
to Me,

127
00:21:12,636 --> 00:21:16,414
if you are not respectful, Christ gets
very angry

128
00:21:16,615 --> 00:21:20,651
because He has said that anything against
Holy Ghost, He won’t tolerate.

129
00:21:20,852 --> 00:21:26,179
So the My chakra, the Agnya starts,
you see, throwing anger,

130
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,819
and moving very fast.

131
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:46,668
Now I have to bear it.

132
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:51,978
I cannot tell you the way Christ wants
Me to tell you.

133
00:21:58,764 --> 00:22:04,603
Because He is very direct,

134
00:22:06,931 --> 00:22:13,500
and I have to little bit be careful so that
you don’t get upset.

135
00:22:20,662 --> 00:22:25,853
Moreover, while doing the puja, supposing
you are a doubting type,

136
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:34,108
or you are opposing it, then you don’t
absorb the vibrations and I have problems,

137
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:52,623
because the vibrations are flowing and
you are not receiving it.

138
00:22:52,832 --> 00:22:57,330
So I don’t know how to contain within
Myself if you don’t suck in the vibrations,

139
00:22:57,546 --> 00:23:01,981
so I take time to take them out.

140
00:23:17,649 --> 00:23:20,077
So all these things are very symbolic,

141
00:23:20,278 --> 00:23:25,290
whatever we are doing is very symbolic.

142
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:36,301
And that symbol actually acts.

143
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,577
For example if you give somebody a flower,

144
00:23:42,778 --> 00:23:47,584
 that fellow feels, that person feels
extremely joyous and happy,

145
00:23:47,785 --> 00:23:52,238
and gratitude comes in.

146
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:06,057
So when you offer Me say, flowers
or anything like water or anything,

147
00:24:06,258 --> 00:24:14,550
then the elements are happy and the deities
are happy in the chakras.

148
00:24:26,955 --> 00:24:31,435
And then they emit their vibrations
of their quality

149
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,648
and of their blessings on you.

150
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:39,655
They give you their quality and their
blessings.

151
00:24:48,449 --> 00:24:52,486
That is how the Divine acts.

152
00:24:55,713 --> 00:25:04,546
And gradually after puja you will feel it,
that the whole thing is working out.

153
00:25:09,427 --> 00:25:11,894
Now we are doing puja at this time,

154
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:16,174
and all over the world people know
that there’s a puja going on here,

155
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:23,718
so they are also sitting in meditation and
they also get the blessings.

156
00:25:38,372 --> 00:25:42,220
They are also waiting for this moment
when the puja starts.

157
00:25:42,421 --> 00:25:45,115
So we give them a time like eleven
o’clock or so,

158
00:25:45,316 --> 00:25:50,388
up to eleven o’clock we should sit down
and they start at eleven o’clock.

159
00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:53,598
Now they are getting the same blessings,

160
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:55,545
though you are doing the puja

161
00:25:55,746 --> 00:26:00,525
but they also get the blessings in their
meditation.

162
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:26,386
If you are not yet so clever and if you
don’t know all the few things

163
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:29,970
which are important in the puja, does
not matter.

164
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:34,494
Because if you are ignorant about it,
innocent about it,

165
00:26:34,695 --> 00:26:39,639
God knows, He forgives, He doesn’t mind.

166
00:26:58,488 --> 00:27:01,931
You should not mind if you commit any
mistakes or anything:

167
00:27:02,132 --> 00:27:07,724
just with a humble heart, do the way
you like.

168
00:27:16,687 --> 00:27:19,926
Gradually, you will learn.
But if you know

169
00:27:20,127 --> 00:27:25,640
and then you deliberately make mistakes,
then it’s not good.

170
00:27:37,116 --> 00:27:44,588
As we forgive our children, God also
forgives innocent children.

171
00:27:50,546 --> 00:27:54,877
So you should be very relaxed about it.

172
00:27:56,290 --> 00:28:00,931
And just do it for the joy of your heart.

173
00:28:02,964 --> 00:28:06,007
May God bless you all.

174
00:28:10,249 --> 00:28:14,340
[I think – he finds it difficult to sit
in the lap.

175
00:28:14,541 --> 00:28:17,466
He can sit at the back if he likes,
this gentleman.

176
00:28:17,667 --> 00:28:20,911
This little boy is too much for him to sit
like [that] –

177
00:28:21,112 --> 00:28:23,044
you can sit comfortably, be comfortable,

178
00:28:23,245 --> 00:28:26,633
there’s nothing to feel bad.]

179
00:28:28,002 --> 00:28:31,916
Now, they have to wash the Feet.

180
00:28:35,176 --> 00:28:36,982
The children have to wash the Feet

181
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:43,515
and we’ll be singing that time the praise
of Shri Ganesha.
