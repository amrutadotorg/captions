1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:14,280
Now the first Chakra is the one, which manifests
outside, the Pelvic plexus, which doctors know of.

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,280
And this plexus looks after 
the excretory system of human beings.

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,960
Even the sex is looked after by this particular center.

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:34,440
Now, one must understand that Kundalini
does not pierce through the first chakra.

5
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,400
So the sex does not play any part, 
in the ascending Kundalini.

6
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:47,760
Those people who preach that through sex
you can reach God, are doing anti-God activities.

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:56,240
One must know that if you indulge too much
into sex, and perverted sex,

8
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,360
you develop deseases.

9
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:05,320
Those people who are also austere type, 
who lead an unnatural life,

10
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:14,640
also become very dry, and impossible to be understood
by anyone, as they have no emotion being left in them.

11
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:21,240
So one has to be in the center of their innocence.

12
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,960
Once you have maintained that innocence,
it is very easy to raise the Kundalini.

13
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:34,200
There is a big force of the Kundalini raising in a person,
who has lead an innocent married life.

14
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,520
But unfortunately, in the west especially,
many writers like Freud,

15
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,440
we should say philosophers
have done such harm to people.

16
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:52,080
That the result of that today we are seeing
 in the deseases of such nature like AIDS.

17
00:01:52,200 --> 00:02:02,160
In Sahaja Yoga, automatically, once the Kundalini raises,
you start becoming a very balanced personality.

18
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,720
That you lead a very sane sexual life.

19
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,720
As a result of this nonsensical theory,
today we find, so many marriages broken,

20
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,000
so many divorces, so many children stranded,
so many people hurt in their heart.

21
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,080
Due to this satanic attack on human innocence,

22
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:32,120
human beings have accepted such absurd ideas,
that they think they have to now become a sex point.

23
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:41,080
Instead of becoming a human being
which is an epitome of a complete creation,

24
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,760
the one who is the rightful owner of God’s kingdom,

25
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,960
the one who has to lead an eternal life,

26
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,800
the one who has to enjoy
the blissful benediction of his father.

27
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:05,000
Today in this society, we find people 
who are wasting their life,

28
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,000
ruining their families,

29
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,480
ruining their children.

30
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,320
Women fighting with men, men fighting with women,
 it’s horrible.

31
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:22,640
So one has to understand that
once the Kundalini gets awakened, a person

32
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:30,560
automatically starts gearing up
to the natural forces of the divinity.

33
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,800
If both the partners are realized souls,

34
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,840
the relationship is so deep,

35
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:45,760
that even if they may not, soft of,
show off the relationship,

36
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,680
inside they had the security of oneness.

37
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,560
The absolute enjoyment of romance manifests.

38
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:00,960
Nowadays, Romeo and Juliette are changing
according to the hair style one has.

39
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:10,040
You see, people going on an escalator for a divorce,
and showing off their love by kissing each other

40
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,400
and if you ask them “where are you going?”
they are going to the divorce case.

41
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,680
Is this any development,

42
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,120
where everyone is insecure?

43
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:24,560
Where every child faces the catastrophe
 which fall upon him one day?

44
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:32,840
Without realization, it is impossible now,
at this stage where the society is

45
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:40,280
at its disastrous point,
to understand the value of the companionship.

46
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,880
So the first thing that happens
to a person is that he develops

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,040
a sane attitude towards sex and towards his partner.

48
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:58,200
Of course, you don’t have to run away from sex,
but also not to be so much dominated by sex life,

49
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,000
that there is nothing else left in your life.

50
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:15,040
Such strengthening boundaries are created
that you enjoy all that strength within yourself.

51
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,480
You never hurt another person.

52
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,960
You always make the other person really joyous.

53
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,800
You see the good points of another person

54
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,920
and you have such tremendous capacity of wisdom

55
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,560
and poise,

56
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,800
that the whole system changes.

57
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,200
And the married life becomes a beautiful dream.

58
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:48,200
There is a
very great writer in England called Barbara Cartland,

59
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,520
and they took her interview.

60
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,520
She is a very religious woman,
a very nice person, a realized soul.

61
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:02,280
And she is the most popular, her books
sell like hot cakes all over the world.

62
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,000
And they ask her, how is it you manage that.

63
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,520
So she said, every man and woman,

64
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:17,840
in their hearts of hearts,
want to lead a very happy, joyous, romantic life.

65
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:27,040
But the key to that is
complete fidelity and loyalty and enjoyment of married life.

66
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:36,400
And she goes further to say that
if you can produce such ideal romantic couples,

67
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,400
people like to see their imagination reflected.

68
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,320
But that can be seen when you really get your realization,

69
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,040
automatically, you don’t have to read her.

70
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,920
Secondly your innocence is awakened within you,

71
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,960
which grows gradually.

72
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,360
And you enjoy your innocence.

73
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,640
You enjoy your virtues.

74
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,320
Sometimes we are very cunning, we are deceiving ourselves.

75
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,920
Specially, the intelligence as a capacity to cheat itself.

76
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:12,760
But you develop that pure intelligence which is called
as wisdom.

77
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,320
But the manifestation of that is very great.

78
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,840
A society of such people is so pure.

79
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,960
The relationship
of husband wife are only private relationships,

80
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,840
but with others they are pure, absolutely pure relations.

81
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,350
There are no complications.

82
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,723
The life is so simple.

83
00:07:35,843 --> 00:07:38,459
There are no emotional problems.

84
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,560
There are no sex problems.

85
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,597
There are no problems about children.

86
00:07:43,717 --> 00:07:48,378
You get very beautiful realized souls as your children.

87
00:07:48,498 --> 00:07:49,898
Very healthy,

88
00:07:50,018 --> 00:07:51,338
very wise,

89
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,458
and extremely joy giving.

90
00:07:53,578 --> 00:07:57,738
They don’t cry too much,
they don’t trouble you too much,

91
00:07:57,858 --> 00:08:04,218
but they are all the time thinking how to
respect their parents and how to give them joy.

92
00:08:04,338 --> 00:08:11,178
There are thousands and thousands in this
country I know, who are born realized children.

93
00:08:11,298 --> 00:08:16,178
I see them in the market,
I see them on the road, I see them in the restaurants.

94
00:08:16,298 --> 00:08:18,978
But the parents don’t understand them at all.

95
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,938
Because they are born at a higher level than their parents.

96
00:08:22,058 --> 00:08:24,578
They are special people taken birth.

97
00:08:24,698 --> 00:08:26,818
To do the great work of God.

98
00:08:26,938 --> 00:08:31,338
And unless and until, the parents are realized souls,

99
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:35,483
they will be always the hindrance
to the children’s growth.
