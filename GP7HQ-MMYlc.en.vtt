06:42.790 --> 06:51.470
Today is a sad day because such a great man
like Sadat is dead.

06:51.470 --> 06:57.552
He is not great to Me because he was a great
politician or he was president, but he was

06:57.577 --> 07:02.760
a saint, he was a realized soul, I knew all
about him.

07:02.760 --> 07:15.801
The attack of the negativity is on but no
more they will crucify a saint this way and

07:15.801 --> 07:20.115
will not face the punishment.

07:20.608 --> 07:23.600
They will be punished now.

07:23.600 --> 07:33.939
All those who tried to do such things will
be punished because the new age has started.

07:33.939 --> 07:45.459
Today I wanted to tell you about the Agya
chakra, about Jesus Christ who adorns this

07:45.459 --> 07:51.809
center of Agya chakra, where you see the red
mark.

07:51.809 --> 08:03.691
Behind that, inside, in the brain on the crossing
of the optic chiasm is this subtle center

08:03.691 --> 08:14.950
where this great Deity is placed through His
crucifixion and through His Resurrection.

08:14.950 --> 08:20.724
He has created this space for us to enter
into the Kingdom of God,

08:20.749 --> 08:22.104
which is placed within us.

08:22.129 --> 08:35.510
Is not in without, is the limbic area that
surrounds your ego and superego.

08:35.510 --> 08:42.400
In the Puranas, in the ancient scriptures
of India, Christ is described so very clearly.

08:42.400 --> 08:50.829
Actually in the Bible what they saw of Him
when He was on this Earth was written down.

08:50.829 --> 08:57.900
But nothing what created Him, how He came
on this Earth what is the spirit of Christ,

08:57.900 --> 09:03.320
what is the seat of Christ and how He came
and what is His purpose and where does He

09:03.320 --> 09:04.672
stand within us.

09:04.697 --> 09:11.401
All these things are not described in the
Bible as I told you the people at that time

09:11.426 --> 09:20.600
were not at all aware of His greatness, of
His special Incarnation.

09:20.600 --> 09:30.550
But if you read some of these ancient books
you’ll find that He was called as Mahavishnu

09:30.550 --> 09:37.380
in the Devi Purana, in the Goddess Purana,
is the ancient scripture of the Goddess.

09:37.380 --> 09:43.686
Mahavishnu was created immaculately.

09:44.998 --> 09:57.570
Now when we say that Christ always pointed
out this pick is very significant.

09:57.570 --> 10:07.090
Actually this, this means Vishuddhi chakra
and means also America.

10:07.090 --> 10:13.210
But this also means Vishuddhi chakra stands
for Shri Krishna as I told you and He is the

10:13.210 --> 10:23.700
Primordial Being, and He is the epitome of
our evolution in the sense that He is the

10:23.700 --> 10:31.510
Primordial Being who is the Father, who is
the preserver.

10:31.510 --> 10:38.640
Now in the Puranas He is described that His
power was Radha, Radha.

10:38.640 --> 10:46.006
Sanskrit language is absolutely very scientific
as far as the Divine Laws are concerned.

10:46.053 --> 10:49.194
Ra means the energy, dha means the one that
sustains.

10:49.227 --> 10:56.969
[SANSKRIT TALK] She is the one who sustains
the energy and She was His power.

10:56.969 --> 11:03.959
But in India Krishna is never taken as Krishna
Radha but Radha Krishna.

11:03.984 --> 11:09.250
The energy is before the deity.

11:09.250 --> 11:13.620
The lady is before the gentleman, we can say.

11:13.620 --> 11:14.979
Radha Krishna.

11:14.979 --> 11:23.478
Now this special happening took place long
time back.

11:24.056 --> 11:33.160
This is at the stage of Vaikunta as we call
it, at the stage where nothing existed as

11:33.185 --> 11:36.250
far as this world was concerned.

11:36.687 --> 11:39.114
At different stages it came up.

11:39.364 --> 11:46.170
We see the world in such a way that it was
created in seven days, but actually these

11:46.170 --> 11:52.505
are seven stages in when this whole Universe
was created and we are at the seventh stage,

11:52.530 --> 11:53.764
we can say.

11:54.077 --> 12:00.830
Now at the first Vaikunta stage where it was
all decided, how to work it out the creation

12:00.830 --> 12:09.810
of this great personality, of the Son of God,
the greatest of all, the Adhara, the support

12:09.810 --> 12:13.230
of the universe, this Mahavishnu.

12:13.230 --> 12:21.070
So Radha, She’s Mahalakshmi, She is the
central path.

12:23.413 --> 12:29.353
First She created Him in the Vaikunta stage.

12:30.810 --> 12:42.588
And at that stage She decided that She’ll
create It by Herself this great Incarnation

12:42.713 --> 12:45.900
and She created this Mahavishnu.

12:45.900 --> 12:55.020
I would like you to get the translation of
the description of Mahavishnu and also the

12:55.045 --> 13:03.650
description of Ganesha who is the Spirit of
Christ and who incarnated in this, on this

13:03.650 --> 13:10.170
earth as our Lord Jesus Christ.

13:10.631 --> 13:26.370
So we have here an Incarnation, a very special
one, which was conceived thousands and thousands

13:26.395 --> 13:34.810
of years back at this level where it’s only
the activity of the God’s mind was there,

13:34.810 --> 13:45.070
Vaikunta stage, where it was decided that
this power called Radha will conceive Him

13:45.070 --> 13:47.210
in Her heart.

13:47.210 --> 13:53.470
And She conceived Him in Her heart.

13:53.470 --> 13:58.831
And then He was made like an egg.

13:59.206 --> 14:03.210
See the symbolism of Easter, like an egg.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.560
Can you recognize it?

14:05.560 --> 14:08.750
People knew about it somehow.

14:08.775 --> 14:12.827
Why do we have Easter, eggs?

14:12.927 --> 14:16.370
We never think about it.

14:16.370 --> 14:27.180
He was created like an egg out of which the
half of it was kept as the seed, as Shri Ganesha,

14:27.180 --> 14:34.257
as the Spirit, and a half of it was created
as Jesus Christ.

14:34.452 --> 14:45.560
The whole egg was nothing but the egg of this
Divine power, which has to manifest this Divine

14:45.560 --> 14:49.410
power on this Earth.

14:49.410 --> 15:00.149
This story is very beautiful, how She created
and then He asked: “Who is my Father?”

15:00.375 --> 15:04.060
Radha is nobody else but Mother Mary Herself.

15:04.060 --> 15:05.670
She is Mahalakshmi.

15:05.670 --> 15:10.669
People may say that they can’t believe in
immaculate birth of Christ.

15:10.669 --> 15:13.140
They cannot believe in the conception of Christ.

15:13.140 --> 15:18.539
I mean you it’s easy for people to say:”
We don’t believe.”

15:18.539 --> 15:21.099
What do they know about God?

15:21.124 --> 15:24.560
What do they know about His mysterious ways
of doing it?

15:24.585 --> 15:31.389
Can you say how you convert or you transform
a flower into a fruit?

15:31.389 --> 15:41.411
You don’t know anything about living miracles
and you start doubting the Immaculate Conception.

15:41.598 --> 15:47.941
Here, when you got your Realization I conceived
you in My heart and gave you Realization through

15:47.966 --> 15:50.620
My Sahasrara.

15:50.620 --> 15:52.730
How did you get your Realization?

15:52.730 --> 15:54.899
You never thought of it.

15:54.899 --> 15:56.209
Is an impossibility.

15:56.209 --> 15:58.846
Thousands of people are getting Realization.

15:58.871 --> 16:00.162
How is it possible?

16:00.187 --> 16:05.160
There must be something special about Me and
about the way it is done.

16:05.160 --> 16:15.545
In the same way She conceived and gave Him
the birth through Her uterus.

16:15.765 --> 16:20.171
You can move it anywhere on your central system.

16:20.265 --> 16:35.180
And this great Incarnation came on this Earth
with such a special purpose that He was nothing

16:35.180 --> 16:45.389
but Pranava, is the, this integrated power,
this great power which has all the powers

16:45.389 --> 16:49.920
in it: the Iccha Shakti, the Prana Shakti
and the Dharma Shakti is the central path,

16:49.920 --> 16:54.829
all of these put together.

16:54.829 --> 17:11.029
He was nothing but energy, energy put into
an egg because He had to do a very great job.

17:11.029 --> 17:26.410
So this Radha Herself, this Mahalakshmi, this
Mother Mary conceived this child and to name

17:26.410 --> 17:31.360
Him after Krishna who was the Father.

17:31.360 --> 17:33.519
She called Him Christ.

17:33.519 --> 17:40.119
Christ come from the word ... In Indian language
is, we call Him Krist, Krishna.

17:40.119 --> 17:46.040
Krishna means the one who has sown the seed.

17:46.040 --> 17:47.040
He is the Father.

17:47.040 --> 17:49.460
He points out always to the Father.

17:49.460 --> 17:55.660
But in the Puranas it is described that Krishna
said: “You are higher than Me.

17:55.660 --> 17:59.019
I placed You higher than Me”.

17:59.019 --> 18:09.279
He placed Him, you can imagine that Christ
is at this point and Krishna is at this point.

18:09.279 --> 18:16.500
He placed higher Him than Him and He said:
“In anywhere people worship Me – Shri

18:16.500 --> 18:21.019
Krishna said – automatically You are worshipped.

18:21.019 --> 18:27.259
You will be the support, Adhara, of the whole
world.”

18:27.259 --> 18:35.201
Is wonderful to say that about I think 14000
years or 12000 years back, Markandeya, such

18:35.201 --> 18:37.969
a great saint was born in India.

18:37.969 --> 18:45.240
And he has written the complete Ganesha Stotram,
means the complete praise of Ganesha.

18:45.474 --> 18:52.920
You can see the translation is so beautiful
and that he said: ”You’ll be so humble”.

18:52.920 --> 19:04.209
He is the one who is the ninth Incarnation
called as [BAUTHA] among the ten Incarnations.

19:04.209 --> 19:14.509
That He will be so humble that He will wash
the feet of His disciples.

19:14.509 --> 19:18.170
All the miracles of Christ are described in
these books.

19:18.217 --> 19:21.309
But these books are not translated.

19:24.085 --> 19:32.834
And that He will be the one, when enlightened
within you with the Kundalini, He will take

19:32.859 --> 19:42.743
away all your karmas and all your conditionings
because He will die for your sins,

19:42.768 --> 19:44.510
for your karmas.

19:45.139 --> 19:55.879
The world will not have to suffer anymore,
if He is awaken within you.

19:55.879 --> 20:00.680
These are all the things already written,
thousands of years back.

20:00.680 --> 20:02.630
Can you imagine?

20:02.630 --> 20:11.474
I wish the Christians who went from here to
take, explain Christianity to Indians told

20:11.499 --> 20:18.529
them that Mahavishnu is already born and we
are preaching about Him, the One who is going

20:18.529 --> 20:25.689
to suck your conditioning, the One who is
going to suck all your problems of karmas.

20:26.484 --> 20:28.298
They never told.

20:28.323 --> 20:34.499
On the contrary, they were so stupid, I must
tell you, that they would put a loaf in a

20:34.499 --> 20:40.740
well and say that: “You all have become
Christians because we have put the meat of

20:40.740 --> 20:44.216
the beef, the beef inside the well”.

20:44.241 --> 20:45.943
Indians don’t eat beef, you see.

20:45.968 --> 20:47.752
“So you all have become Christians”.

20:47.777 --> 20:50.734
Villages after villages they converted into
Christianity.

20:50.906 --> 20:53.579
They started branding them as Christians.

20:54.293 --> 20:56.222
This was absurd.

20:56.301 --> 21:03.706
And that’s why the people were waiting and
waiting for the Advent of Christ.

21:03.815 --> 21:13.339
His name Christ comes from the word Krishna,
Krist, and the second one is Jesus.

21:13.589 --> 21:18.897
Krishna had a foster mother whom Radha loved
very much.

21:19.116 --> 21:25.680
Her name was Yeshoda, we also call her as
[Jesoda, Jeshoda].

21:26.090 --> 21:29.127
Christ is called also as [Yesu, Yeshu] in
India.

21:29.152 --> 21:35.199
The short form of [Jesoda, Jeshoda] is [Yesu,
Yeshu] or [Jeshu, Jesu] we have both the things.

21:35.199 --> 21:38.290
From there the name Jesus has come.

21:38.290 --> 21:47.740
She wanted to name Her after the foster mother
because she was a lady so she was called as

21:47.740 --> 21:54.829
[Jeshoda, Jesoda] but for a man She selected
the name [Yesu, Yeshu] and [Jeshu, Jesu].

21:54.829 --> 22:03.480
Moreover the word [Jeshu, Jesu] or [Yeshu,
Yesu] is very important.

22:03.480 --> 22:10.290
“J” in Sanskrit language means, every
word has a meaning in Sanskrit language, means

22:10.290 --> 22:15.800
to know, is to know, the knowledge, Gyana.

22:15.800 --> 22:17.719
[SANSKRIT TALK].

22:17.719 --> 22:20.839
The one who knows.

22:20.839 --> 22:25.389
But [Jeshu, Jesu] [“shu”, “su”] means
auspicious.

22:25.389 --> 22:31.870
[“Shu”, “Su”] means “that brings
auspiciousness, that brings blessings”.

22:31.870 --> 22:38.761
Jeshu is the one who knows how to bring auspiciousness
on this Earth.

22:40.095 --> 22:47.094
People never told this, they never knew who
went from here with the message

22:47.119 --> 22:50.903
that Christ  was born.

22:52.223 --> 23:00.033
At the time when Christ came on this Earth
with this big message that somebody has to

23:00.058 --> 23:04.147
pass through this special problem.

23:04.335 --> 23:07.041
Now let’s see why the problem was there.

23:07.283 --> 23:14.439
We have to understand the problem that faced
human beings at that subtle level where they

23:14.464 --> 23:21.440
had to work out this special, a very extraordinary
Incarnation.

23:21.440 --> 23:28.679
The problem was that human beings had raised
their heads.

23:28.679 --> 23:37.679
By raising their heads their ego and superego
grew up around their limbic area, making it

23:37.704 --> 23:45.008
a very hard shell, just like an egg.

23:45.249 --> 23:53.259
A man developed his I-ness and only way to
transform him into a bird, like an egg breaks

23:53.259 --> 23:59.469
up into a bird, was to make the Kundalini
rise.

24:00.233 --> 24:09.623
But how to make that compact stuff where it
is crossing, crossable, which can be crossed

24:09.648 --> 24:14.512
over, which can be passed through.

24:14.965 --> 24:22.410
So they had to create this special Incarnation,
which is nothing but Pranava, the Aum, the

24:22.435 --> 24:28.829
Logos as you call it, the sound of the All
Pervading Power.

24:28.829 --> 24:40.500
To be put at a place where nothing but the
power itself can remain, because anybody else,

24:40.500 --> 24:49.210
all other Incarnations who came on this Earth
had all the five elements within them.

24:49.210 --> 24:55.187
But He was just the power, the energy, the
complete energy.

24:56.616 --> 25:02.328
He didn’t have, for example we all human
beings are made of five elements on the right

25:02.353 --> 25:11.825
hand side as I told you, and when we die the
part that is our body, means one of the five

25:11.850 --> 25:16.719
koshas, as they call the cocoons of the body
which is the matter, falls off.

25:17.039 --> 25:23.080
Then the water cocoon also falls off and the
soul remains with the Spirit on your head

25:23.080 --> 25:26.400
and the Kundalini also there.

25:26.400 --> 25:33.490
But He was the only One who had no earth element
in it.

25:35.240 --> 25:43.999
And so it was a very special type of an energy
engulfed, engulfed into a human being was

25:43.999 --> 25:44.999
placed.

25:44.999 --> 25:50.479
Krishna has said about the eternal life and
about the Spirit.

25:50.504 --> 26:01.366
In Sanskrit language is very beautiful because
it’s a mantra: [SANSKRIT].

26:01.575 --> 26:05.660
Means it cannot be killed by anyone, the Spirit
cannot be killed.

26:05.660 --> 26:07.760
It is eternal.

26:07.785 --> 26:09.135
You cannot press it.

26:09.463 --> 26:15.130
It cannot be flown out by any wind.

26:15.130 --> 26:22.130
And He had to prove it and to prove that they
had to have somebody here, on this Earth,

26:22.130 --> 26:29.749
with that energy to come in, with a body,
to act like a human being, live like a human

26:29.749 --> 26:40.140
being and go through that drama of death to
show that He overcomes the death.

26:40.140 --> 26:47.620
The Resurrection is our message, that He resurrects
Himself.

26:47.792 --> 26:54.601
He had to die and He had to be resurrected
because He says that it is beyond death.

26:54.875 --> 26:57.918
Krishna has said that the Spirit is beyond
death.

26:57.943 --> 27:05.599
And the Spirit had to come on this Earth.

27:05.599 --> 27:14.989
So you understand when we talk of Christ how
little we know as to how this worked out.

27:16.459 --> 27:20.229
Is the most difficult thing that he did.

27:20.229 --> 27:28.032
And His Mother was the Mahalakshmi, is the
power, which is the central power of sustenance,

27:28.266 --> 27:34.153
pure sustenance, pure holiness, pure innocence.

27:34.411 --> 27:40.124
Such a powerful woman She was, very powerful.

27:40.390 --> 27:51.057
And Himself is endowed with, you won’t believe,
with eleven powers of Rudra, means of destruction,

27:51.082 --> 27:52.412
eleven powers of Rudra.

27:52.857 --> 27:54.147
He’s Ekadesha Rudra.

27:54.147 --> 27:57.904
Is described, all that is described, I’m
not telling it as My own.

27:58.069 --> 28:01.099
You can see for yourself.

28:01.124 --> 28:08.271
He was endowed with eleven powers of destruction.

28:10.365 --> 28:16.254
But He was to go through all this, with all
the humility.

28:17.410 --> 28:22.559
When you have all these powers with you and
when egoistical people behave like this, these

28:22.584 --> 28:31.889
donkeys, you see, who could not understand
Him, these brainless people in those days,

28:32.092 --> 28:41.558
who could not believe Him, He could have destroyed
all of them in one [SHOT, SHUT].

28:42.027 --> 28:44.996
Absolutely He has got eleven Rudras.

28:44.996 --> 28:51.376
You can imagine His destructive powers, with
which He is going to come back.

28:51.829 --> 28:55.667
And He had to keep them in control.

28:55.667 --> 29:04.907
But He didn’t say about His Mother much,
because She was the power and if He had said

29:04.907 --> 29:11.415
so, then they would have directed, these negative
forces would have directed all their attention

29:11.440 --> 29:18.356
towards Her and then He would have used all
these eleven powers and the whole drama would

29:18.356 --> 29:19.427
have been failed.

29:19.427 --> 29:21.576
So He kept quiet on that.

29:21.576 --> 29:27.267
My father, as I told you, was a learned man
and a very great soul and [WE] used to discuss

29:27.267 --> 29:35.497
about these things and I said: “Martin Luther,
who was a Realized soul, when he started his

29:35.497 --> 29:47.667
new movement of Protestants, why did he not
enhance the glory of the Mother?”

29:47.667 --> 29:54.777
As the Catholics knew, because Catholics just
followed after Christ so it linked about with

29:54.777 --> 29:55.907
them.

29:55.907 --> 30:03.277
My father told Me that at that time Martin
Luther faced three forces against him.

30:03.277 --> 30:10.057
First one was the Christians themselves, the
Catholics, who believed in nunneries and all

30:10.057 --> 30:19.517
kinds of ritualism and all kinds of nonsense,
which he wanted to flout, then he had another

30:19.517 --> 30:27.297
force, which was facing and that one was the
one that came from the Jews because they would

30:27.297 --> 30:28.777
not accept Him.

30:30.628 --> 30:33.928
Even today they don’t accept Him.

30:34.444 --> 30:36.644
They are very adamant.

30:36.644 --> 30:45.914
And the third force that he had to face was
the Islam, Islamic.

30:45.914 --> 30:53.510
And the Islam pleaded down the role of a woman
though Fatima Herself was the Holy Ghost,

30:53.535 --> 30:58.486
is the Mahakali power, the daughter of Mohammad.

30:59.476 --> 31:07.235
But he pleaded down just because the Islam
had pleaded down he thought gradually as Protestants

31:07.235 --> 31:17.485
will grow up, he will start introducing the
greatness of His Mother.

31:17.485 --> 31:27.576
As it is Jews even today are after the Immaculate
Conception.

31:27.576 --> 31:33.285
In London, very recently, I think about two
years back, as they have money they paid some

31:33.285 --> 31:37.176
of the newspapers and published something
nonsensical about Christ.

31:37.176 --> 31:48.456
They said that it was predicted in the Bible
that a child will be born to a girl, but it

31:48.456 --> 31:55.816
was not a virgin, the Hebrew word, as it is,
is for the girl and not a virgin.

31:55.816 --> 32:04.516
I said: “In those days, we didn’t have
girls of 18 years as we have today”.

32:04.516 --> 32:09.856
Even in India today if you say a girl, a [KANYA,]
means a virgin, [KANYA] and virgin is the

32:09.856 --> 32:14.446
same, means the Virgo.

32:14.446 --> 32:15.605
Modern times are funny.

32:15.605 --> 32:18.516
We can’t judge Christ style according to
modern times.

32:18.516 --> 32:25.456
Even you find a woman who is married ten times
they’ll call her a girl here.

32:25.456 --> 32:28.726
But one should logically understand this point.

32:28.726 --> 32:30.576
Is very logical.

32:30.576 --> 32:38.586
But if it was to be said that a prophecy means
something special, that a child would be born

32:38.586 --> 32:44.135
to a girl, of course it is going to be born
to a girl and not to a boy.

32:44.135 --> 32:47.696
And why was the girl word?

32:47.696 --> 32:48.905
It is going to be born to a boy.

32:48.905 --> 32:51.615
If it is to a woman it is nothing special.

32:51.615 --> 32:53.836
What is there to prophesize and say about
it?

32:53.836 --> 33:04.855
Is so logical that when the word girl came
in it meant the virgin.

33:04.855 --> 33:07.365
All kind of things they are talking, doesn’t
matter.

33:07.365 --> 33:12.486
First of all they say that our, we have to
suffer till our Savior comes because Christ

33:12.486 --> 33:15.496
didn’t suffer for them.

33:15.496 --> 33:20.096
So they are suffering.

33:20.096 --> 33:30.226
Now, we have to know that Christ has suffered
for us absolutely to the brim.

33:31.395 --> 33:34.510
We don’t have to suffer anymore.

33:34.535 --> 33:47.245
Is a nonsensical idea coming from people who
are sadistic, who have no joy in themselves.

33:47.245 --> 33:49.226
They cannot see you happy.

33:51.730 --> 34:01.035
And that’s why also they make Christ look
like a TB patient, I should say.

34:01.035 --> 34:11.066
I went to the Sistine Chapel and Michelangelo
was a realized soul, a great person.

34:11.066 --> 34:15.905
He has done complete justice to the image
of Christ.

34:15.930 --> 34:27.157
Huge big thing like a, we can say, a Texas
fellow standing with a lambodara, with a big

34:27.266 --> 34:28.766
stomach of this kind.

34:28.791 --> 34:30.888
Ganesha is lambodara.

34:30.913 --> 34:35.525
Standing there throwing people right and left.

34:35.525 --> 34:39.695
Just see the words, how He has spoken.

34:39.720 --> 34:48.145
He was not a cabbage like person, He was extremely
dynamic, He was full of vigor,

34:48.170 --> 34:50.614
He was absolutely fearless.

34:50.794 --> 34:52.826
He had nothing to fear.

34:53.916 --> 35:00.196
And He’s standing there and throwing people
to the left and the right and the right ones

35:00.196 --> 35:04.816
is accepting them and putting them in the
Kingdom of Heaven.

35:04.816 --> 35:06.253
Just imagine!

35:06.278 --> 35:10.625
It is Michelangelo is the only person who
has really done justice to Him and I would

35:10.625 --> 35:15.163
say Rubens because of his habits of painting
the muscles, he’s done a very beautiful

35:15.188 --> 35:21.781
painting, I saw, is in the place where he
lives, of the ascent and descent of Christ.

35:21.866 --> 35:25.816
Beautiful, one of the best one could think.

35:26.312 --> 35:29.722
Nowhere miseries written on His face.

35:29.747 --> 35:31.905
Such people do not feel the misery.

35:31.905 --> 35:35.885
They just watch the drama.

35:35.885 --> 35:48.635
They don’t suffer because of taking up your
sufferings it took it upon Himself and He

35:48.635 --> 35:59.725
showed to the world that: “Now I ask forgiveness
from My Father”.

35:59.725 --> 36:06.823
He stood as a representative of all the seekers
of the world before His Father

36:06.848 --> 36:08.807
who is a wrathful Father.

36:08.959 --> 36:17.229
I told you Shri Krishna has a Samara Shakti
and worse than that is the witness God whom

36:17.254 --> 36:19.019
we call as Sadashiva.

36:19.113 --> 36:22.624
He is only there when He has to destroy.

36:22.827 --> 36:31.452
And He asks as your representative: “O Father,
please, forgive them”.

36:31.477 --> 36:40.820
He asks for forgiveness, facing His own Father
as your representative that:

36:40.845 --> 36:43.187
“Please, forgive them”.

36:44.917 --> 36:49.614
This is the greatest weapon He has given us,
to forgive.

36:52.887 --> 36:59.985
That’s one thing none of the Christian nations
are doing, is to forgive.

36:59.985 --> 37:04.105
Perhaps people have not known the power of
love.

37:04.105 --> 37:05.105
They do not.

37:05.105 --> 37:06.105
They talk.

37:06.105 --> 37:07.105
God is love.

37:07.105 --> 37:08.885
Just talk, talk, talk, talk.

37:08.885 --> 37:14.816
If God is love then love must be the most
powerful thing.

37:14.816 --> 37:26.096
When I first started My work I flouted all
these fake gurus by names in India and I told

37:26.096 --> 37:30.176
them what devils they had been and I‘ve
known them for ages.

37:30.176 --> 37:32.502
And people told Me that: “They will shoot
You this time”.

37:32.527 --> 37:34.083
I said: “Let them start shooting.

37:34.108 --> 37:39.606
I’ll se who can shoot Me.” [AND ALL THOSE
I HAVE] flouted them anywhere I get the chance.

37:39.635 --> 37:42.745
I’ve told that: “These are horrible people“.

37:42.745 --> 37:46.673
As Christ has said: “Hot or cold.”

37:47.212 --> 37:51.956
He doesn’t mind, because if it is cold they
are realized, if they are hot then we’ll

37:51.956 --> 37:52.956
fight them.

37:52.956 --> 37:55.176
We can tell them how.

37:55.176 --> 37:59.556
But if they are one lukewarm, you see, there
are people: “O, we are in different awareness,

37:59.556 --> 38:04.535
they are in different awareness, we must accept
this awareness also, we must accept...”

38:04.535 --> 38:09.845
Such people are the ones He said: “I’ll
spout them out of My mouth”.

38:09.845 --> 38:10.895
So clearly.

38:10.895 --> 38:15.966
He’s the One who whipped people who were
selling things in the temple.

38:15.966 --> 38:21.270
He is the One who said: “Don’t throw pearls
before the swine.”

38:22.012 --> 38:26.216
So far I’ve never used this word but He
has.

38:26.216 --> 38:30.246
He was dynamic.

38:30.246 --> 38:32.235
He was not afraid of anyone.

38:32.235 --> 38:38.275
And He couldn’t bear the mediocrity and
this kind of balance: “Oh, we have them

38:38.275 --> 38:41.655
also, we can have the devils and also the
Gods”.

38:41.990 --> 38:43.936
People argue: “Why do You criticize them?

38:43.936 --> 38:45.666
They don’t criticize You”.

38:45.666 --> 38:52.655
He said: “The devil, the Satan is not going
to speak against his own house”.

38:53.303 --> 38:55.945
This is exactly what is happening today.

38:56.124 --> 39:02.109
I’ve seen when I say that: “This man is
a devil”, people say: “Mother, why do

39:02.134 --> 39:03.241
you call him a devil?”

39:03.266 --> 39:04.781
“Because he’s a devil, I have to call
him a devil.

39:04.806 --> 39:06.206
I’m your Mother.”

39:07.376 --> 39:14.035
When I see a person suffering, he cannot get
his Realization because he went to this devil,

39:14.035 --> 39:16.166
I have to say he’s a devil whether you like
it or not.

39:16.166 --> 39:22.841
If you are a true seeker you stand up to that
and see for yourself you are a true seeker.

39:22.866 --> 39:28.666
And if you are a true seeker you must find
your Spirit and you must get to your Realization.

39:28.666 --> 39:32.126
I’m not here for any elections or pampering.

39:32.126 --> 39:40.245
I’m here to give you your own, to have your
own Spirit, to enjoy your being.

39:40.245 --> 39:46.535
Even if the whole world gets against Me, I’m
not bothered about it.

39:46.535 --> 39:54.785
I’m here of course to look after you, to
tell you in a proper way.

39:54.785 --> 40:03.466
But if it comes to the devils I will be the
One who will stand against them, every minute.

40:03.466 --> 40:08.475
Whatever may they come in, whatever guard,
it’s very easy to make them out once you

40:08.500 --> 40:10.013
get your Realization.

40:10.400 --> 40:11.930
It’s very easy to find out.

40:11.955 --> 40:14.056
He Himself has said it all these things.

40:14.056 --> 40:16.515
He said: “Don’t judge anyone”.

40:16.515 --> 40:19.677
Before Realization you can’t judge anyone,
from the appearances.

40:19.716 --> 40:25.086
They look very sweet, you know, or they talk
very sweetly.

40:25.111 --> 40:32.800
They come to you in a band, you see, and they
walk with such beautiful gait.

40:32.869 --> 40:38.787
They are great dramatist, some of them play
tricks, jump like Krishna.

40:38.826 --> 40:42.286
Some say: “We are Incarnation of Christ.”

40:42.794 --> 40:48.676
There was a gentleman who said: “I’m the
Incarnation of Krishna”.

40:48.676 --> 40:54.546
I told him: “Why do you make the ladies
nude and naked?

40:54.546 --> 40:59.476
What religion has taught you this, to make
the ladies nude and naked, take out their

40:59.476 --> 41:02.036
clothes and make them dance?

41:02.036 --> 41:03.036
What is this?”

41:03.036 --> 41:04.606
“O, he said, I’m Shri Krishna!”

41:04.606 --> 41:05.666
I said: “Really?

41:05.666 --> 41:08.135
I never knew Shri Krishna did that.”

41:08.135 --> 41:09.895
He said: “No, He did.”

41:09.896 --> 41:15.820
Once Krishna was a small child of four years,
you can imagine, a naughty little thing.

41:15.845 --> 41:18.686
What did He understand of nudity or that?

41:18.686 --> 41:19.686
Innocent.

41:19.686 --> 41:26.156
And the gopis, you see, were having their
bath in the river Yamuna where Radha was putting

41:26.181 --> 41:28.586
Her feet, so the water was all vibrated.

41:28.586 --> 41:38.038
And He climbed up onto a tree and they had
put their clothes on a tree and He hid them.

41:38.406 --> 41:41.236
So they were asking for His clothes: “Now
what are you doing?

41:41.236 --> 41:42.426
Why have you hidden?”

41:42.426 --> 41:43.426
It’s a mischief.

41:43.426 --> 41:45.216
It’s the fun.

41:45.216 --> 41:48.066
But in that fun what He was doing?

41:48.066 --> 41:52.806
Was to give them Realization because He could
see their Kundalini at the back.

41:52.806 --> 41:54.186
[AS, AND] a child of four years...

41:54.186 --> 41:58.109
What does a child of four years know about
nudity, or dress or anything?

41:58.134 --> 41:59.134
Innocent.

41:59.857 --> 42:03.986
Modern children may be very precautious, but
not in those days.

42:03.986 --> 42:08.406
But when He was the king in Dwarika – I
asked this nonsensical fellow who says he

42:08.406 --> 42:15.736
is the Bhagavanan, and the Shri Krishna – I
said when He was a grown up man and a king

42:15.736 --> 42:23.236
in Dwarika, which is at least two thousand
miles away from Hastinapur Delhi, and a lady

42:23.236 --> 42:30.226
called Draupadi, who called Him as a brother,
was troubled because she was pound and all

42:30.226 --> 42:36.776
that, a big story of Mahabharata, you might
be knowing Draupadi, and a devil of a man

42:36.776 --> 42:42.076
called Dhuriodhana said that: ” I’ll make
you nude”, tried to pull Her sari.

42:42.076 --> 42:46.816
It’s a beautiful description of the whole
thing.

42:46.816 --> 42:55.216
He, He was worried that she will lose her
chastity by removing her..., this is called

42:55.216 --> 42:56.746
as [SANSKRIT WORD].

42:56.746 --> 43:04.038
So she put it in her mouth like this and she
was to call Krishna.

43:04.038 --> 43:09.026
She says: “Kri”, and she was holding because
Krishna means “falls down”.

43:09.026 --> 43:15.876
And as soon as she found that the sari is
going, she said: ”shna”, and the description

43:15.876 --> 43:20.804
is so great: “[SANSKRIT TALK]”.

43:20.829 --> 43:26.189
When she did that “shna” it echoed in
Dwarika where He was ruling.

43:26.214 --> 43:27.504
He was the king there.

43:27.504 --> 43:36.313
And with shanka, chakra, gada, padma, these
are four weapons, one better that the other.

43:36.338 --> 43:44.962
One is sufficient, the chakra, I told you,
all up on to on the Garuda, on the condor

43:44.987 --> 43:48.957
He arrived there to save the chastity of His
sister.

43:49.584 --> 43:55.358
If He was fond of removing the clothes of
women, why did He all the way

43:55.383 --> 43:56.751
come and save that?

43:56.803 --> 44:00.163
And this fellow didn’t know how to answer
Me.

44:00.677 --> 44:03.554
I told him: “One day your clothes will be
taken out like this”.

44:03.607 --> 44:05.523
Within eight days it happened.

44:05.523 --> 44:09.253
Somebody took out all his clothes and he was
dancing on the street and nowadays he’s

44:09.253 --> 44:13.773
backing America with a paralysis.

44:16.074 --> 44:18.443
He couldn’t smell flowers.

44:18.443 --> 44:20.433
One better that the other.

44:20.433 --> 44:23.833
But his disciples, if you tell them: “O,
don’t say, Mother.

44:23.833 --> 44:25.233
We love him.”

44:25.233 --> 44:31.423
This kind of a funny mesmerism it’s stupidity.

44:31.423 --> 44:33.813
Awake yourself!

44:33.813 --> 44:39.593
This kind of emotional nonsensical attachment
to one person is not going to give you Realization.

44:39.593 --> 44:42.481
You have to become your Spirit.

44:43.770 --> 44:49.878
You have to be actually reborn.

44:52.403 --> 44:55.708
There is no place for devilish people.

44:57.120 --> 45:01.433
If they are from hell they will go back to
that, but many of their disciples are also

45:01.433 --> 45:03.051
walking through.

45:03.160 --> 45:06.740
[WHILE, WHY] they are My children, I would
say?

45:07.240 --> 45:17.553
They are the children of God, they are the
men of God, as described as William Blake.

45:17.553 --> 45:23.951
They have been born on this earth for seeking
because they know this is the time they are

45:23.976 --> 45:28.223
going to achieve their Realization and these
horrible people have mesmerized them.

45:28.223 --> 45:35.523
At this time should I go and garland them
and say: “You are very nice people”?

45:35.523 --> 45:40.533
If you expect Me to do that, then you have
not understood Me at all.

45:41.319 --> 45:44.554
No use telling Me: “O, their awareness is
different.”

45:44.579 --> 45:50.183
I see that your Kundalini is ruined, you are
up to get a blood cancer or some sort of a

45:50.183 --> 45:54.923
cancer or you are going to get into the lunatic
asylum.

45:54.923 --> 45:59.670
Something horrible is going to happen to you
and when I see that am I to say “Yes”

45:59.741 --> 46:02.233
the one who has done, go and fall at his feet?

46:02.233 --> 46:06.663
But if there’s a real guru I would go and
meet him Myself.

46:06.663 --> 46:11.613
There are many, but they are hiding.

46:11.613 --> 46:16.993
I sent one fellow to New York, he ran away
within two days, within two days.

46:16.993 --> 46:20.353
He said: “O, these New York people are different”.

46:21.899 --> 46:24.519
He said: “I have to take a circus with me.

46:26.177 --> 46:29.119
They like a circus.”

46:31.573 --> 46:34.373
But Houston people are different.

46:35.987 --> 46:45.354
Now, so this was the great Incarnation of
Christ who came on this Earth, a very dynamic.

46:46.221 --> 46:51.643
Those who say that: “I’m the Christ”,
there’s many, you see, self certified people:

46:51.643 --> 46:53.173
“I’m the Christ”.

46:53.173 --> 47:02.157
Now the kind of a Christ they do, He was never
like that, He was a healthy man and He was

47:02.182 --> 47:08.289
not one of these people who’s these cheeks
have gone inside, who looks like a miserable,

47:08.314 --> 47:12.275
hungry, pitiable man.

47:12.621 --> 47:15.074
Anyone of this would say´s that:" I´m the Christ"

47:15.098 --> 47:17.098
Ask them to walk on the water

47:17.419 --> 47:21.216
Immediately on foot up and one foot down

47:23.560 --> 47:27.537
Ask them to walk on the water, if
they can walk, is alright.

47:27.561 --> 47:30.551
Supposing I said I'm the Holy ghost

47:30.977 --> 47:32.977
If I say so

47:33.526 --> 47:35.603
then is a significance of that

47:35.769 --> 47:38.527
That in the presence of Holy Ghost,
the Kundalini rises.

47:38.824 --> 47:40.369
Is written down.

47:40.394 --> 47:45.924
There are thousand things written and every
word has to be tallied with that person otherwise

47:45.949 --> 47:47.319
you just don’t believe.

47:47.758 --> 47:54.762
Let them go and walk on the water, is not
far away from you, seventeen miles only, and

47:54.787 --> 47:56.689
see how far they go.

47:58.252 --> 48:00.734
Is the best way to judge these people.

48:00.759 --> 48:04.119
We have got a method to judge these people.

48:04.346 --> 48:10.249
Thank God, we are born in modern times when
we are not [ILLITERATE], we have had Christ,

48:10.351 --> 48:16.312
we have had so many people, we can read and
we can understand, we should logically reach

48:16.312 --> 48:22.322
the position to understand what do we have
to expect from a Realized Soul.

48:22.322 --> 48:28.622
If he talks like a politician who wants to
have votes, how can you believe that such

48:28.622 --> 48:32.782
a person could be an Incarnation?

48:32.782 --> 48:39.552
An Incarnation has not only to be a fearless
person, but has to be a holy person.

48:39.552 --> 48:42.842
Not the one who is like a parasite living
on other people.

48:42.842 --> 48:45.332
Like these lamas [ARE].

48:45.332 --> 48:56.942
They live like parasites in Nepal and also
in Lhasa [UNCLEAR] were suffering.

48:57.083 --> 49:04.362
They had no food but these lamas were living
and taking their special Ambrose, they call

49:04.362 --> 49:07.072
it, in golden cups.

49:07.321 --> 49:11.281
Today they are driven out so they are on our
head in India.

49:11.790 --> 49:15.822
We have to support these nonsensical people
sitting down there as lamas, these parasites

49:15.822 --> 49:17.452
of the worst type.

49:17.452 --> 49:23.252
And those who could not get a place there
are now moving about and now they want to

49:23.252 --> 49:27.356
live on a marble flooring.

49:27.381 --> 49:29.981
They can’t live on a carpet flooring.

49:29.981 --> 49:32.948
They must have a marble flooring.

49:32.973 --> 49:41.095
And people have to starve themselves to create
a marble flooring for these horrible parasites.

49:41.120 --> 49:44.701
Why should a saint ask for anything?

49:44.701 --> 49:46.811
A saint is a king.

49:46.811 --> 49:50.131
He’s above all these comforts of life.

49:50.131 --> 49:51.731
He’s not bothered.

49:51.731 --> 49:58.031
I mean, if you ask, I can sleep on the street,
I’ve no problem, no problem, because I’m

49:58.031 --> 49:59.988
above the want, I’m above greed.

50:00.013 --> 50:04.423
I don’t know what sort of a thing is temptation.

50:04.448 --> 50:16.841
If they call themselves as Godly people, look
at their faces, worn out, biscuity, serious,

50:16.841 --> 50:17.841
nonsensical people.

50:17.841 --> 50:20.402
They have no sense of humor of any kind.

50:20.427 --> 50:27.171
Not only but I’ve seen some disciple who
came to Me, all their bone was broken, all

50:27.171 --> 50:30.794
their back bone was broken, every bone was
broken by these people.

50:30.819 --> 50:33.981
They use to beat them [THESE SADISTS].

50:33.981 --> 50:39.978
They take money from you and finish your Kundalini.

50:40.003 --> 50:44.808
Their days have come now.

50:44.866 --> 50:49.324
Because they talk well don’t believe them.

50:49.349 --> 50:51.172
What have they given you?

50:51.584 --> 50:54.372
Somebody says: “They have given us the knowledge”.

50:54.397 --> 50:56.090
All right, what knowledge?

50:56.115 --> 50:58.173
What knowledge have they given you?

50:58.782 --> 51:01.236
Knowledge, is all mental.

51:01.261 --> 51:07.671
What have you got it in your awareness, where
you have to evolve, when you rise.

51:07.671 --> 51:16.050
Christ has described it so clearly, I did
not say what a Realized soul should be.

51:16.082 --> 51:24.268
You become a witness, you become a witness
of the whole drama, of the whole show.

51:24.293 --> 51:26.557
And this should happen to you.

51:26.582 --> 51:31.202
Not only, but you are empowered with the powers
of your Spirit.

51:31.896 --> 51:34.717
At least your health should be all right.

51:34.742 --> 51:41.781
People are suffering from stresses and strain,
having a headache all the time, jumping on

51:41.781 --> 51:44.682
their sits and they say: “We get very positive
results”.

51:44.707 --> 51:47.801
What are positive results?

51:47.801 --> 51:54.905
These make believes if you carry on with them
you will have no way of judging

51:54.930 --> 51:57.211
as to where you are.

51:57.211 --> 52:00.476
First of all get your Realization.

52:00.501 --> 52:07.752
Get to your discretion power and realize that
it is you can judge them after Realization,

52:07.777 --> 52:09.210
not before.

52:10.061 --> 52:11.771
Christ has said “right discretion”.

52:11.771 --> 52:15.857
He has used the word: “right discretion”.

52:15.882 --> 52:21.517
How do you get “right discretion” unless
and until you are realized?

52:22.501 --> 52:27.341
And this is not to be self-certified.

52:27.341 --> 52:30.951
As Christ has said: “You’ll be calling
Me Christ, Christ.

52:30.951 --> 52:32.651
I will not recognize you”.

52:33.229 --> 52:34.720
Meaning what?

52:34.852 --> 52:40.801
Those who say: “We are Christians”, you
see, going about with the label: “We are

52:40.801 --> 52:46.917
Christians, we go to church, sing our hymns
and come back home and quarrel,

52:46.942 --> 52:49.034
going to wars, fight.

52:49.911 --> 52:54.831
We are the people who drink on a Christmas
day.

52:54.831 --> 53:00.111
On a Christmas day, we drink!”

53:00.111 --> 53:05.574
Now, when Christ said that, they said at the
time of Christ, He went to a wedding and

53:05.599 --> 53:06.999
He blessed the wine.

53:07.186 --> 53:08.387
Is not true.

53:08.412 --> 53:15.471
That wine, at that time never meant, even
in India today, wine never means an alcohol.

53:15.496 --> 53:21.421
But Moses has talked about it very clearly
and Abraham has talked about it because they

53:21.421 --> 53:27.781
had to deal with this Void which I told you,
the Primordial Masters, they had to deal with

53:27.781 --> 53:34.191
the liver, so they talked about it, they called
it the “strong drink” and “fermented

53:34.191 --> 53:36.934
drink”, so clearly.

53:36.959 --> 53:41.512
But everything happens if somebody dies, you
must have champagne to celebrate his death

53:41.537 --> 53:42.512
perhaps.

53:42.537 --> 53:45.539
If Christ is born we must have champagne.

53:45.564 --> 53:54.005
If Christ is born that is the day we should
dedicate ourselves to our Spirit, not to get

53:54.030 --> 53:55.661
out of your awareness.

53:56.202 --> 54:01.650
Anyone of these fermented things take you
away from your attention.

54:01.675 --> 54:05.840
Your attention is in a way empathized.

54:05.865 --> 54:09.685
I don’t say: “You don’t drink!” at
this stage but after Realization

54:09.710 --> 54:10.771
you will not.

54:11.155 --> 54:14.271
You will not, even if you want to.

54:14.296 --> 54:21.030
You will not drink, because you get drunk.

54:21.216 --> 54:26.651
Like Me, if I go to a party, you see, they
will always say: “Please, have something.

54:26.651 --> 54:27.721
O, You must have, please.

54:27.721 --> 54:28.961
You have not tested this.

54:28.961 --> 54:30.191
You better have”.

54:30.191 --> 54:32.451
I said: “No, sir, I’m sorry, I’m over
drunk already.

54:32.451 --> 54:35.471
If I drink more, I don’t know what will
happen to Me”.

54:35.471 --> 54:38.261
I mean you can’t tell them: “You don’t
drink”.

54:38.261 --> 54:43.441
You see, that would be absolutely [UNLIARLY]
to tell them: “Please, don’t drink today”.

54:43.441 --> 54:47.541
But they’ll go on forcing you and if you
say anything against it then absolutely you

54:47.541 --> 54:50.621
are no eliteness about you.

54:50.621 --> 54:54.711
You are absolutely unsophisticated.

54:54.711 --> 54:58.971
This is the thing in this world.

54:58.971 --> 55:00.570
Virtue has no meaning.

55:00.595 --> 55:03.628
If you are virtuous, you better hide yourself.

55:03.653 --> 55:05.245
Not in Sahaja Yoga.

55:05.341 --> 55:08.417
You enjoy your virtues in Sahaja Yoga.

55:08.495 --> 55:11.666
You really enjoy yours and others virtues.

55:11.728 --> 55:16.776
Is a very different thing as in the unity
church you call it, a New Age is coming, is

55:16.825 --> 55:18.394
absolutely true.

55:18.996 --> 55:30.741
I find, as I told you the principles of this
church are very, very close to that which

55:30.741 --> 55:33.901
is the stage on to which you have to jump.

55:33.926 --> 55:44.537
And that’s why the right conclusion that
is reached is absolutely the way to understand

55:44.568 --> 55:47.332
where you have to reach logically.

55:49.254 --> 55:56.734
But you must know, you have to take a stand.

55:56.759 --> 56:04.901
You cannot be a person who’s apologetic.

56:04.926 --> 56:08.622
There is no place for apologies.

56:08.730 --> 56:11.603
If you are a realized soul, you are a realized
soul.

56:11.628 --> 56:14.761
You are not dominating it by that to anyone.

56:14.761 --> 56:16.841
You are not dominating.

56:18.540 --> 56:25.006
By that you accept your situation with glory
and with pride.

56:26.748 --> 56:33.198
But I’ve seen many Sahaja Yogis also feel
shy to accept that they are realized.

56:33.223 --> 56:35.206
They understand what’s happening.

56:35.231 --> 56:40.645
They are giggling, they are laughing at the
way people are, but they find it impossible

56:40.670 --> 56:47.231
to talk to them about their Realization, that
other should get their Realization.

56:47.231 --> 56:54.351
You have to take a stand in your family, in
your surroundings, with your friends and you

56:54.376 --> 56:58.903
have to tell them that: “You better all
get realized”.

56:58.949 --> 57:07.631
The reason for that is that the Christ who
crucified Himself, He is going to come back,

57:07.631 --> 57:13.528
with his eleven forces of destruction.

57:13.614 --> 57:21.081
And then He’s not going to tell you anything,
not going to ask you to take any Realization,

57:21.081 --> 57:26.161
nor He is bothered whether you go to hell.

57:26.161 --> 57:30.664
He will just sort out.

57:30.773 --> 57:38.299
But those who have got Realization will enter
into the Kingdom of God.

57:38.324 --> 57:41.481
You have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

57:41.481 --> 57:45.198
Here, as I say, is the seventh chakra.

57:45.223 --> 57:54.851
I told you about the sixth chakra, which is
adorned by Jesus Christ and the mantra of

57:54.876 --> 58:00.095
the (seventh chakra), sixth chakra is our
Lord’s Prayer.

58:00.163 --> 58:03.591
That’s the way you can solve both the things.

58:03.591 --> 58:07.142
But the bija mantra is Ham Ksham.

58:07.167 --> 58:09.107
Ham Ksham.

58:09.842 --> 58:21.251
It means that when you are infested with negativity,
with depression, with the attack of the superego,

58:21.251 --> 58:27.286
as shown here, then you have to say: “I
am, I’m going to fight you”.

58:27.311 --> 58:34.981
If you go to a guru who makes you a negative
person, who makes you feel very shy, who says:

58:34.981 --> 58:39.655
“You are all the ego and you are good for
nothing, you must pay me more and pay me more”.

58:39.680 --> 58:43.816
And you all the time say that: “Oh, must
be something wrong with me, nothing wrong

58:43.841 --> 58:46.355
with this man”.

58:46.380 --> 58:53.597
If there is self-pity and also there is guilt,
then you have to say: “I am not guilty”.

58:53.722 --> 58:59.298
Then you have to say that: “I’m my own
guru”, if you have left side problems.

58:59.338 --> 59:07.521
But if you have right side problems, then
you have to say: “I forgive, Ham Ksham”.

59:07.521 --> 59:15.161
These are the bija mantras of this two, which
you have got, your symbol is of these two

59:15.161 --> 59:17.761
wings, is actually the Agya chakra.

59:17.761 --> 59:20.421
It is just like that.

59:20.421 --> 59:23.611
Agya chakra is just like that.

59:23.611 --> 59:27.441
But they call it the, what Egyptian, what...
no, is not that.

59:27.441 --> 59:34.631
You see, this symbol has come to you from
unconscious, is the Agya chakra, is this center.

59:34.631 --> 59:39.173
Egyptians didn’t know much about God, I
must tell you.

59:39.198 --> 59:43.737
Of course pyramid is, pyramid is, pyramid
is all vibrated.

59:43.762 --> 59:48.541
But the way they were so much worried about
their dead is horrifying.

59:48.760 --> 59:56.812
Imagine these bones buried in the one box
of gold, then one box of silver, then one

59:56.812 --> 01:00:00.051
box of this and all the ornaments kept with
the dead.

01:00:00.051 --> 01:00:02.621
The dead is finished into bones, the ornaments
are there.

01:00:02.621 --> 01:00:03.725
I’ve seen that in Egypt.

01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:05.826
Mad people, I must say.

01:00:07.748 --> 01:00:11.661
It’s Sadat who would have brought it round.

01:00:11.661 --> 01:00:16.261
But lets see something new will happen there,
in that country.

01:00:16.261 --> 01:00:22.191
Traditional countries have wisdom, inbuilt
wisdom and they go on improving because they

01:00:22.191 --> 01:00:25.211
have tried all these methods and they know
[WHERE TO GO].

01:00:25.211 --> 01:00:26.601
He didn’t talk of death.

01:00:26.601 --> 01:00:32.091
They know it from the people, pharaohs and
all that who had all these kinds of a funny

01:00:32.091 --> 01:00:36.761
mummies going round and keeping the dead in
a silver box and as if the dead knows where

01:00:36.786 --> 01:00:38.206
is the silver.

01:00:40.526 --> 01:00:44.203
Christ has said many things, which we do not
pay attention to.

01:00:44.258 --> 01:00:49.041
[NONE, ONE] of them is about the dead.

01:00:49.041 --> 01:00:56.018
In every church, I was happy to know that
in this church there is no cemetery.

01:00:56.043 --> 01:00:59.358
You walk into a cemetery if you want to go
to a church.

01:00:59.383 --> 01:01:04.475
A lady who came from India, she said: “Everything
seems to be upside down in England”.

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:05.500
I said: “What?”

01:01:05.525 --> 01:01:07.797
She said: “I went to see a church.

01:01:07.867 --> 01:01:11.171
And all the dead were laid there under my
feet.

01:01:11.171 --> 01:01:13.091
And I was holding my sari walking like this.

01:01:13.091 --> 01:01:15.551
I was thinking I was going to step.

01:01:15.551 --> 01:01:17.831
And the lady with me said: ‘What, you should
walk straight‘.

01:01:17.831 --> 01:01:19.941
She said: ‘How can I, you see?

01:01:19.941 --> 01:01:21.141
These are dead here.

01:01:21.141 --> 01:01:22.351

Bible, maybe, but He showed that He took out

01:01:44.331 --> 01:01:50.751
the spirits, He talked of spirits of so many
people, and put them in the pigs and put them

01:01:50.751 --> 01:01:51.781
in the sea.

01:01:51.781 --> 01:01:58.391
