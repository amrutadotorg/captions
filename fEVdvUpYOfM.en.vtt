00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.680
Mother, please, come in my heart.

00:00:16.254 --> 00:00:31.619
Clean my heart, so you are there.
O put Your feet into my heart.

00:00:32.455 --> 00:00:40.525
let Your feet be worshiped there.

00:00:43.064 --> 00:00:51.771
For the first time Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi travels to the Heart of the Universe.

00:00:51.911 --> 00:01:01.400
Beginning Her auspicious journey in Mumbai, India (the 'Yoga-bhumi',
the land of yoga and the Kundalini of the Universe),

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:09.427
where a small group of local yogis gather to wish their
fond farewells, knowing that early the next morning

00:01:09.452 --> 00:01:19.732
on the 1st January 1974, Shri Mataji will land
by aeroplane in London, the Heart of the Heart.

00:01:22.911 --> 00:01:25.013
'England will be Jerusalem.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.690
Remember that I've come all the way from
India to do that.

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.510
Let's see how the English are going
to behave towards it'.

00:01:38.111 --> 00:01:48.028
Nearly 2,000 years since Shri Mataji last walked
in England as Mother Mary with Her son, the youthful Jesus;

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:54.726
150 years since the incarnation of
Shri Bhairavanath as William Blake;

00:01:54.751 --> 00:02:06.683
and thousands of years since Shri Adi Guru Dattatreya (as had Shri Ganesha
before him) meditated along the banks of the River Thames.

00:02:08.542 --> 00:02:15.496
'He predicted it one hundred years back, and today if you come to Sahaja Yoga, you'll be amazed what you are.

00:02:15.574 --> 00:02:24.908
Whatever he has predicted about England
being the Jerusalem of tomorrow, that tomorrow is today.

00:02:25.213 --> 00:02:30.658
The place of worship,
where people have to come to worship'.

00:02:52.014 --> 00:02:59.187
O Holy Virgin,

00:02:59.835 --> 00:03:05.058
clad in purest white,

00:03:05.844 --> 00:03:11.680
Unlock heaven's golden gates

00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:21.904
Salutations to the Goddess who abides in Wales,
'Cymru', the land of the Kundalini power,

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:31.782
of Shri Gauri Kundalini Mata - the Maharashtra of Britain and the land of the Goddess Rhiannon,

00:03:32.046 --> 00:03:40.571
who rides the pure white horse of the Kundalini.
We worship Mount Snowdon, 'Yr Wyddfa',

00:03:41.126 --> 00:03:49.840
the seat of that Kundalini power, drawing the water element from the ocean as purifying rain.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:04:00.520
We honour the holy Isle of Anglesey, 'Ynys Môn',
the intersection of numerous nadis and ley lines in the Mother Earth,

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.382
and the central point within the British Isles;

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:12.468
land of abundant fertility and last stronghold of the Druids who worshiped Shri Adi Guru Dattatreya;

00:04:13.507 --> 00:04:20.343
with its Swayambhuh to Shri Ganesha at Holyhead, 'Caergybi', guarding towards the west.

00:04:21.772 --> 00:04:34.096
and the great River Severn, 'Afon Hafren', one of the seven great nadis
of Britain, winding from the Plynlimon mountains in the West,

00:04:36.807 --> 00:04:45.785
towards the Bristol channel, the Vishuddhi
of Britain and the wide Atlantic Ocean.

00:04:47.081 --> 00:04:54.614
Wales: land of song, rivers and mountains.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:28.510
Salutations to the Goddess who abides in Ireland,
'Éire', the land of the Goddess 'Ériu', the land of the Devi,

00:05:29.393 --> 00:05:39.173
the Centre Heart chakra of Shri Jagadamba,
of Shri Durga Mata, who took the form of a blessed cow,

00:05:39.752 --> 00:05:46.057
Shri Gomata, along the banks of the River Boyne,
'Abhainn na Bóinne';

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.320
who as the Paps of Anu, 'Dá Chích Anann',

00:05:51.320 --> 00:06:00.160
grants all the sustenance of the Mother Goddess
from Her all-embracing love for the world with Her nourishing breasts;

00:06:01.593 --> 00:06:07.520
and who manifested as Bridgid of the flame, the Celtic Goddess Brigid,

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:14.154
at the Hill of Uisneach, the place of the hearth, and
the Sacred Centre of Ireland,

00:06:14.436 --> 00:06:23.686
from where, on 1st February each year, they light the beacons
to enlighten all the thirty-two counties of Ireland

00:06:23.711 --> 00:06:31.335
with the light of the Triple Goddess of the Sun,
Brigid, the Celtic Athena,

00:06:31.796 --> 00:06:43.014
the Irish goddess of spring fertility and life of the Arts crafts
and the spirit of prophecy.

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:56.235
We salute the Swayambhus at Skellig Michael, 'Sceilig Mhichíl', to the southwest
and at Ireland’s Eye, 'Inis Mac Neasáin', in the East,

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:07.814
and the seven hills of Dublin, 'Baile Átha Cliath',
and the seven hills of Belfast, 'Béal Feirste'.

00:07:08.228 --> 00:07:21.238
We bow to the great River Shannon, 'Abhainn na Sionainne',
the longest river of the British Isles,
which flows from Shannon Pot in the Cuilcagh Mountains,

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:45.391
'Binn Chuilceach', near the border with Ulster,
'Ulaidh', in Northern Ireland

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.368
to flow southerly through Loch Aillionn,

00:07:51.071 --> 00:07:55.917
Loch Rí and Loch Deirgeirt,

00:07:59.208 --> 00:08:06.440
through the to the cities of Athlone, 'Baile Átha Luain',
and Limerick, 'Luimneach',

00:08:07.416 --> 00:08:17.071
and into the Shannon Estuary, to the place where in the
mid-1980s, Shri Mataji's feet touched the land of Ireland

00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:22.686
for the one and only time,
at Shannon Airport en route to America.

00:08:23.991 --> 00:08:31.444
'England itself is really a great country - it's the Heart
of the Universe, is the greatest country

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:45.320
as far as the articulation is concerned; and the
source of all that is good, comes from this country'.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:12.941
Salutations to the Goddess who abides in England,
the land of Shri Shiva, the pure Spirit,

00:09:14.043 --> 00:09:20.584
the left heart, the pure white land
of Albion, of William Blake,

00:09:20.694 --> 00:09:32.286
as expressed by the evocative white cliffs of Dover,
the land where the Goddess Herself abides as purity and chastity.

00:09:34.794 --> 00:09:41.884
'Now, heart is the most important organ in the
body, if the heart fails, the whole body fails.

00:09:44.274 --> 00:09:47.469
Supposing the brain fails,
still the body will go on,

00:09:49.227 --> 00:09:55.088
but if the heart fails, the body stops functioning.

00:09:57.479 --> 00:10:01.315
So the attack is on the heart.

00:10:05.354 --> 00:10:09.136
All the satanic forces and demonic
forces and destructive forces

00:10:09.161 --> 00:10:19.840
will try to attack the heart naturally,
because if they attack any other place

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.368
then the body will be still functioning.

00:10:22.393 --> 00:10:27.008
So first, they will try all their methods to attack the heart'.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:52.567
We invoke Shri Shiva as Shri Nad’īshwara,
the Lord of rivers, the channels,

00:10:52.592 --> 00:11:00.469
to vibrate the nadis of England and to awaken the people of
this land of Albion from spiritual sleep.

00:11:01.789 --> 00:11:11.039
'The River Thames has to become the Ganges.
This is the Heart of the Universe, England is the Heart'.

00:11:14.064 --> 00:11:22.880
First with Shri Mataji at Seven Springs in Gloucestershire,
the source of the Thames in the Cotswold Hills:

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:31.856
from the Sanskrit Tamas, the Ida nadi that flows
through the Heart of the Universe and purifies this universe.

00:11:33.043 --> 00:11:37.779
We worship the seven rivers, the
the Sapta Nadis of the Heart:

00:11:38.639 --> 00:11:40.100
the Thames;

00:11:41.443 --> 00:11:43.693
the Derwent in Yorkshire;

00:11:45.889 --> 00:11:48.217
the Trent in Derbyishire;

00:11:49.857 --> 00:11:52.146
the Ouse in Cambridgeshire;

00:11:53.172 --> 00:11:56.052
the Don in Aberdeenshire, Scotland;

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:59.670
the Forth in Stirling, Scotland;

00:12:00.664 --> 00:12:03.937
and the Severn in Wales and England.

00:12:06.937 --> 00:12:13.644
'Since we are sort of honouring the rivers,
five rivers, that they should get awakened,

00:12:13.669 --> 00:12:21.356
and those who drink water out of those rivers,
should have the Nabhi by which they should seek God'.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:10.995
'And did those Feet in Ancient Time,

00:14:11.045 --> 00:14:20.865
Walk upon England's mountains green?'

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:30.838
We honour and remember all the Divine Hands
that have come before to lay the foundations of the New Jerusalem.

00:14:31.619 --> 00:14:37.766
We remember how Shri Ganesha Himself
meditated upon the banks of the River Thames,

00:14:37.791 --> 00:14:48.520
and later Shri Adi Guru Dattatreya, whose spiritual
followers became the first Druids and the builders of Stonehenge.

00:14:49.588 --> 00:14:55.447
Like Blake, in his poem Jerusalem and
confirmed by Shri Mataji Herself,

00:14:55.812 --> 00:15:02.125
we remember how in ancient time, in
the first half of the first century AD,

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:15.041
sometime between the years 12 and 29, Mother Mary and the youthful Jesus
landed in his uncle's merchant ship at Looe on the Cornish coast

00:15:15.066 --> 00:15:22.463
and walked all over the West Country of England,
vibrating the Earth for generations to come;

00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:28.360
how Christ planted his staff in the Mother Earth at Wyrral Hill

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:36.400
overlooking Glastonbury Tor, 'Ynys Wydryn, the
Agnya chakra of England, and it rooted overnight

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:42.120
and grew into a hawthorn tree that
blooms each year at Christmas.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:49.000
How Christ once built there and dedicated
a wooden temple in honour of His Mother,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:57.274
that was worshipped and praised by the patron saint
of Wales, St David, centuries later in 540 AD,

00:15:57.299 --> 00:16:11.493
and even recognised by Augustine, the 6th Century Bishop of Canterbury, as the first
church and 'one divinely built by the hands of Christ Himself'.

00:16:11.518 --> 00:16:20.660
And how Christ and Mary loosened the stranglehold of
druidic power over the heart of the society of Ancient Britons.

00:16:20.685 --> 00:16:25.200
Those same Druids who had by then become corrupt

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:31.840
and jealously controlled knowledge and power like
high-caste Brahmins with their secret knowledge and rituals.

00:16:47.153 --> 00:16:56.373
In 3rd Century Roman Britain, Shri Adi Guru Dattatreya
again incarnated as the soldier St Alban,

00:16:56.398 --> 00:17:03.400
from the word 'Alba' meaning white,
to protect the spiritual from harm.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:10.135
When put on trial for giving sanctuary to a
persecuted Christian, he declared to his Roman judges:

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:16.520
'I worship and adore the true and
living God who created all things.'

00:17:19.442 --> 00:17:28.760
In Georgian Britain, from 1757 to 1827,
Shri Bhairavanath incarnated as William Blake

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:38.609
to express through all the arts a complete vision of
the New Jerusalem to show in unparalleled detail

00:17:38.634 --> 00:17:47.080
the spiritual evolution of humankind:
how to become the Divine Humanity

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:56.000
by the awakening of Jerusalem within every human
being, the feminine power of the Kundalini.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:04.720
And so, he both prepared the way and prophesied
the coming of Shri Mataji and of Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:13.692
foretelling the laying of the foundation stone of the
New Jerusalem in Lambeth's Vale at the ashram in Chelsham Road.

00:18:14.525 --> 00:18:24.135
'It was to be that in England you had to establish Jerusalem.

00:18:25.723 --> 00:18:34.603
I need not tell you again and again,
how important is England in the play of Divine.

00:18:34.628 --> 00:18:46.120
Those who are realised and have
experienced know it that this is the place,

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:53.200
this is the country which has to circulate
the spiritual powers all over the world.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:59.520
The whole of England has to be saved, because
if the heart dies the whole universe will die'.

00:19:01.586 --> 00:19:06.480
We remember all the great incarnations
that have worked so hard

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:10.520
to lay the spiritual
foundations we enjoy today.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:17.680
We salute them and honour them and pray to
them to inspire us in the work of the Divine.

00:19:20.779 --> 00:19:30.585
More than anywhere else in the world, over 1,300
stone circles appear all over the British Isles

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:40.920
dating back to Neolithic times and the very
beginnings of agrarian society. None compares with Stonehenge.

00:19:42.199 --> 00:19:50.767
During visits with yogis in the early 1980s,
Shri Mataji described Stonehenge as the 'Sahasrara of England',

00:19:50.792 --> 00:19:59.517
and explained that it manifest the union of the
Holy Trinity of the Shiva, Shakti and Ganesha principles.

00:19:59.542 --> 00:20:01.939
It contains a Shiva Lingam

00:20:01.964 --> 00:20:05.360
and the heel stone is a Shri Ganesha stone,

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:11.683
while the inner blue stone circle,
more of a parabola, represents the Shakti power.

00:20:12.203 --> 00:20:17.440
Some of the stones were described
by Shri Mataji as Swayambhus created by the Mother Earth,

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:23.320
While most have been engineered by man,
some of the large blue Sarsen stones

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:30.200
having been transported over 170 miles away from the
Preseli mountains in Pembrokeshire, South Wales.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:36.920
According to Shri Mataji, Shri Adi Guru Dattareya Himself oversaw the construction.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:48.040
Apparently, the cross lintels were added much later and actually stopped the flow
of vibrations. Relatively few of these lintels remain today.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:54.160
Astrologically, the structure
is oriented towards the winter solstice at sunset

00:20:54.160 --> 00:21:00.520
and the summer solstice at sunrise,
and the site is on cardinal ley lines

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:07.068
that connect it to other sites of great spiritual
significance within the British Isles and beyond.

00:21:09.229 --> 00:21:14.022
In fact, the greatest points of
intersection between those channels of energy

00:21:14.047 --> 00:21:17.745
occur at Anglesey, in Northwest Wales,

00:21:18.526 --> 00:21:23.552
the Lake District, in Northwest England,
with its Castlerigg stone circle,

00:21:23.577 --> 00:21:27.960
Glastonbury on the Somerset levels, in Southwest England,

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:32.935
and most of all at Stonehenge, on Salisbury plain -

00:21:33.969 --> 00:21:37.600
with the line of St Michael (an aspect of Shri Bhairava)

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:46.070
also known as the line of Apollo and Athena connecting
the Swayambhuh at Skellig Michael, in Ireland,

00:21:46.095 --> 00:21:51.080
with St Michael's Mount, in Marazion, Cornwall,

00:21:51.105 --> 00:21:55.080
Mont-Saint Michel, in Normandy, France,

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:59.080
Cabella, in Liguria, Italy,

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.400
Delphi, in Greece,

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:09.400
ending at Mount Carmel, the spiritual centre
of the Gnostic Essenes, near Jerusalem, in Israel.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:15.080
Near to where Shri Mataji once lived at Shudy Camps
in Cambridgeshire, is a hill called 'Gog Magog',

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:20.040
which Shri Mataji confirmed was created
by people of Indian origin,

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:27.080
who had migrated there during the time of the Mahabharat
to worship the Devi in England.

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:39.000
It was at this time that Shri Anglai Devi was worshipped as the Mother of the English,
who in addition to Mother Mary, is none other than Shri Mahalakshmi.

00:23:40.941 --> 00:23:49.720
Shri Samarth Ramdas later discovered Her murti (her form)
in the mid-17th century in the Krishna River at Brahmapuri,

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:57.240
and established Her temple at Shivaji's fort
of Sajjangad, near Satara, in Maharashtra.

00:23:59.848 --> 00:24:07.947
Moving northward through the Pennine
mountains the spine of England, we reach Scotland, Alba.

00:24:26.827 --> 00:24:36.800
Salutations to the Goddess who abides in Scotland,
'Alba', the Sahasrara of Great Britain,

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:48.040
the pure white land of Shri Sadashiva,
of Lord God Almighty and the holy seat of Shri Shiva Himself,

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:57.760
who resides at Mount Schiehallion, near Aberfeldy in
the very geographical centre of Scotland -

00:24:57.785 --> 00:25:04.099
'Sìth Chailleann', the Caledonian mountain of the fairies.

00:25:04.542 --> 00:25:12.880
Shri Mataji commented that, as in the Himalayas,
Shri Shiva resides in the North looking southward

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:22.840
and originally asked the yogis to find an ashram here in Scotland,
before eventually settling at Shudy Camps in Cambridgeshire in the mid-1980s.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:34.986
Scotland is full of stone circles from Neolithic times,
like the Majestic 'Ring of Brodgar', in the Orkney Islands,

00:25:35.011 --> 00:25:42.640
and vibrated holy islands such as the
Isle of Skye, 'An t-Eilean Sgitheanach',

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:46.120
and Iona, 'Ì Chaluim Chille'.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:54.120
Edinburgh itself, 'Dùn Èidean', has seven hills
vibrated with strands of Shri Mataji's hair

00:25:54.120 --> 00:26:01.120
and includes the Ganesha Swayambhuh
of Arthur’s Seat, 'Suidhe Artair'.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:10.600
For William Blake, Scotland represented 'Urthona', the mysterious Shiva-like
'Zoa' of inspiration and poetic genius,

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:18.600
the one who tirelessly keeps the Divine Vision in time
of trouble and who incarnates as 'Los'

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:24.960
the Divine Artist and Craftsman with his
hammer beating out the rhythm of Time,

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:35.760
taking us beyond the physical, emotional and rational worlds
to lead us towards the pure realm of the Spirit.

00:26:39.175 --> 00:26:49.080
But more than this, as foretold first by
Blake and again emphasised by Shri Mataji Herself,

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:58.968
through the pure love of Shiva-Shakti, we celebrate the
coming together of all the four chambers of the Heart:

00:26:58.993 --> 00:27:09.600
England - 'Albion', Scotland - 'Alba',
Ireland - 'Éire', and Wales - 'Cymru',

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:19.840
to form the blessed integrated Heart that heralds the coming
of the New Jerusalem, the Golden Age of Heaven on Earth,

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:27.520
showering the light of the Supreme Spirit,
manifest through the Spirit of all Beings.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:56.162
May God bless you all,

00:28:57.412 --> 00:28:59.280
and bless this country.

00:29:03.394 --> 00:29:06.943
May God bless you.

00:29:12.308 --> 00:29:19.648
Let me enjoy Your feet in my heart,

00:29:20.507 --> 00:29:36.693
Let me see Your feet in my heart,
O Mother, forever be in my heart,

00:29:42.109 --> 00:29:55.720
Forever, please, reside in my heart.

00:29:45.039 --> 00:30:02.109
O Mother, please, stay in my heart.
