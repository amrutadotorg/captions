22:07.854 --> 22:12.460
I am sorry I had to talk in Hindi because
most of them are Hindi-knowing people

22:12.485 --> 22:15.400
and I've just told them what is
the importance of Bombay,

22:15.425 --> 22:22.223
and why so many incarnations came here,
and why Shri Rama

22:22.248 --> 22:29.173
had to walk in the villages and the hills
and dales of Maharashtra,

22:29.205 --> 22:37.533
what was the need, and the need is that
they should all develop their Sahaja Yoga.

22:37.558 --> 22:42.906
Also, this would be the last Puja
for all of you, in India.

22:42.931 --> 22:46.573
I hope you all have gained a lot
in these different Pujas

22:46.598 --> 22:51.651
and different places we have been to.

22:52.166 --> 22:57.071
Only thing is that one should remember
that Krita Yuga has started.

22:57.104 --> 23:01.254
Now Kali Yuga is over, Krita Yuga
has started, and in this Yuga

23:01.279 --> 23:08.532
- that the Paramchaitanya is absolutely
effective and very efficient.

23:08.557 --> 23:13.779
Now if you do anything wrong it will
punish you.

23:13.804 --> 23:17.715
It may not punish immediately but it
will give you a suggestion,

23:17.740 --> 23:22.609
it will give you a proper signal that
something is going wrong with you.

23:22.634 --> 23:27.735
But if you do not try to control your
footsteps then you may go down very fast.

23:27.760 --> 23:30.541
So you have to be very careful about that.

23:30.566 --> 23:34.003
Actually, I have told you so many times
that there are two forces working,

23:34.028 --> 23:36.857
one which attracts you inside and one
which throws you out.

23:36.882 --> 23:43.864
So it is important for all of us,
all of us to remember

23:43.889 --> 23:48.904
that this Krita Yuga is there, and in that
this Paramchaitanya is overactive.

23:48.904 --> 23:52.877
Also, you are rewarded. You have been
telling me so many stories,

23:52.902 --> 23:56.361
how sahaj it worked out, how sahaj
it has happened,

23:56.386 --> 23:59.841
all of you have been telling Me very
nice stories.

23:59.866 --> 24:08.042
But it is part of your play in Sahaja Yoga

24:08.067 --> 24:10.974
and that you are placed in the kingdom
of God.

24:10.999 --> 24:15.323
So, in the kingdom of God you are there,
try to enjoy it,

24:15.348 --> 24:18.663
that's the only thing you have to do
is to enjoy the kingdom of God.

24:18.688 --> 24:24.355
But if you try to, sort of, dislocate
yourself from this joy,

24:24.380 --> 24:31.430
break the connection of joy by some sort
of thinking, which is not reality,

24:31.455 --> 24:34.278
then you are responsible for yourself.

24:34.303 --> 24:38.342
So, I have to tell you that keep
the connection on. Not only that,

24:38.367 --> 24:45.410
but try to make it stronger and stronger,
and become one with that divine force

24:45.435 --> 24:49.789
permanently, which will flow through you
and will not only enlighten you

24:49.814 --> 24:56.327
but will give you so many powers, and you
will see the new life in this new year.

24:56.352 --> 24:59.587
Yesterday, as I requested you, we have
to work it out now.

24:59.612 --> 25:04.483
Individually, we have to go all out to see
that we spread Sahaja Yoga

25:04.508 --> 25:09.214
and talk about it. On this day I give you
complete freedom

25:09.239 --> 25:13.732
to do what you like to spread Sahaja Yoga.
You need not ask Me any permissions,

25:13.757 --> 25:18.109
and you can try everything that you
want to. But should be something decent,

25:18.134 --> 25:22.258
should not be something indecent
and something which is not behoving

25:22.283 --> 25:27.981
a sahaja yogi. Even if you have to write
letters or answers or anything,

25:28.006 --> 25:30.678
even if you have to show the anger
it should be done

25:30.703 --> 25:35.134
in a very decent and a beautiful
manner.

25:35.159 --> 25:40.289
And it should show that it's a yogi
who is talking.

25:40.314 --> 25:47.468
The other things, whatever problems
you have, will be solved in no time.

25:47.493 --> 25:52.877
But the main problem is yourself, it should
be solved by you by meditative methods.

25:52.902 --> 25:59.904
And so much attention we are paying
to all our extra-curricular activities

25:59.929 --> 26:03.900
but that will definitely fail, it will
boomerang on you

26:03.925 --> 26:06.818
if you do not have the foundation
of Sahaja Yoga.

26:06.843 --> 26:11.791
It is very important to keep attention
on your spirit all the time

26:11.816 --> 26:15.413
so that whatever you are doing, whatever
you are projecting,

26:15.438 --> 26:19.860
has the base and you just don't get lost.
This is a very important thing,

26:19.885 --> 26:27.696
and I am sure that you will understand
that without the nourishment

26:27.721 --> 26:33.868
from the roots you cannot grow. So this
nourishment must be kept alive.

26:33.893 --> 26:37.493
May God bless you. Thank you very much.
