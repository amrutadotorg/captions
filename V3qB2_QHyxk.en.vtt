00:06:37.444 --> 00:06:47.000
I bow to all Sahaja Yogis, saints.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:07:03.252
It is no longer a birthday after the age of sixty years, but  one should remember that the life is getting shorter day by day

00:07:03.252 --> 00:07:24.073
and hence the progress (in Sahaja Yoga) should also be correspondingly faster.

00:07:24.073 --> 00:07:35.695
It is a matter of joy that you have celebrated my birthday with so much enthusiasm.

00:07:35.695 --> 00:07:39.165
There was so much enthusiasm and love.

00:07:39.165 --> 00:07:41.340
I was overjoyed.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:53.673
Sahaja Yogis have to work (for Sahaja yoga) while leading the worldly lives.

00:07:53.673 --> 00:07:59.323
They have to look after their children, households, and parents while practicing Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:59.323 --> 00:08:01.298
I also do the same.

00:08:01.298 --> 00:08:21.516
I also take care of the world (as a family) while looking after my family, my brothers and sisters, all the relations and my husband.

00:08:21.516 --> 00:08:23.854
No one should be left aside.

00:08:23.854 --> 00:08:26.961
So, it is a very difficult task (to manage both).

00:08:26.961 --> 00:08:34.129
Women panic when a daughter or a son falls sick, something goes wrong somewhere, husband is bad etc.

00:08:34.129 --> 00:08:41.082
Similarly, men get jittery with a problem in jobs, reduction in salary, financial constraints etc.

00:08:41.082 --> 00:08:47.300
Also, various other incidents that bring pressure on the minds.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.780
However, in these very circumstances the Sahaja Yoga has to be established.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:09:01.706
If you are away from water and are thirsty, and say that you suppress your thirst, then there is nothing special in it.

00:09:01.706 --> 00:09:09.190
But you are real Sahaja Yogis when you are detached even when water is available around you.

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:13.446
At the beginning many people used to tell Me their family problems,

00:09:13.446 --> 00:09:17.337
“My mother is like this, my father is like that, this is how my husband behaves and also about others”.

00:09:17.337 --> 00:09:20.040
Gradually it reduced

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:29.990
and in Sahaja Yoga the person came to such state that he or she started feeling his personal (worldly) life as a drama.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:40.122
Now, yesterday I noticed that the feeling has been awakened in the people that they should do something in the life of the rest of the world and I was very happy about it.

00:09:40.122 --> 00:09:51.453
Especially in Mumbai the three powers, Shri Mahakali, Shri Mahalakshmi and Shri Mahasaraswati together have specially taken birth from the mother earth.

00:09:51.453 --> 00:10:02.254
The reason is, without such powerful force, Sahaja Yoga shall not be established in the city of The Mumbai.

00:10:02.254 --> 00:10:06.797
A plethora of mal practices are rampant here.

00:10:06.797 --> 00:10:10.090
They are so many that they cannot be described.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:18.127
They are about bhoots, about badhas, about money, and also there is bribery, all kinds of filth.

00:10:18.127 --> 00:10:24.626
Like all rivers merge in the sea, all dirt has settled in this sea which is Mumbai.

00:10:24.626 --> 00:10:32.299
All kinds of thieves, all kinds of lecherous people, all kinds of cheats have come to live here.

00:10:32.299 --> 00:10:37.924
So, we have to bloom in this mire, the lotuses are to be bloomed about which I told you yesterday,

00:10:37.924 --> 00:10:43.700
and if we are able to do that, it is going to benefit the whole country.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.598
In Delhi also the work is going on with full force.

00:10:47.598 --> 00:10:52.458
Similarly, in Mumbai also, you have already done great work.

00:10:52.458 --> 00:11:06.525
That work is, in this land which is devoid of Punya (merits), and Dharma (virtues), in such filth, you are blooming high your own lotuses.

00:11:06.525 --> 00:11:12.511
It is really great and I do not know how I should congratulate you for this.

00:11:12.511 --> 00:11:15.370
I feel proud what a great work has been done for me!

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:19.999
What great work my children have done!

00:11:19.999 --> 00:11:27.979
They have made this beautiful achievement while living in this society, while being connected and being one with this society.

00:11:27.979 --> 00:11:31.911
For this accomplishment I have great respect for you.

00:11:31.911 --> 00:11:37.560
Now do not rely on the slow progress but  you should speed up the progress.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.649
Unless Sahaja Yoga is spread you will not be able to spread.

00:11:40.649 --> 00:11:44.044
Sahaja Yoga should spread, and you should rise.

00:11:44.044 --> 00:11:45.635
Only then it will work out.

00:11:45.635 --> 00:11:48.701
So long as you do not rise, Sahaja Yoga will not spread.

00:11:48.701 --> 00:11:53.946
As a flame enlarges in size, its light also enhances. So, it all depends on you.

00:11:53.946 --> 00:11:57.641
The more the growth of your flame, the more will its light increase.

00:11:57.641 --> 00:12:03.136
I agree, there are various types of people, but have I not established Sahaja Yoga amidst them?

00:12:03.136 --> 00:12:12.121
Have we not created so many Sahaja Yogis in these circumstances and thus proved the existence of God, the existence of God’s power and we can work it out with that power?

00:12:12.121 --> 00:12:18.039
Having thus proved it, we should, without harboring any doubt, forge ahead with open heart.

00:12:18.039 --> 00:12:20.426
We should start the work in a big way.

00:12:20.426 --> 00:12:25.084
If possible, display a board at the place of your residence.

00:12:25.084 --> 00:12:27.833
Start center in every house.

00:12:27.833 --> 00:12:28.930
You must.

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:29.920
Let us see what happens.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:36.092
This way, you should work it out wherever possible, to the extent possible, and little more than that.

00:12:36.092 --> 00:12:39.542
You should have that courage. You can do it.

00:12:39.542 --> 00:12:44.683
I hope the next time I come to Mumbai I shall see a large number of Sahaja Yogis.

00:12:44.683 --> 00:12:46.329
Even otherwise, a good number of them come.

00:12:46.329 --> 00:12:49.214
You saw, yesterday they were in thousands.

00:12:49.214 --> 00:12:54.641
However, how many among them were real, matured and knowledgeable Sahaja Yogis?

00:12:54.641 --> 00:12:59.780
Even now Sahaja Yogis pay more attention to their household problems.

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:04.634
You know, I can solve them in a minute and in Sahaja Yoga they are being solved in a minute.

00:13:04.634 --> 00:13:10.170
But unnecessarily you worry about them and destroy yourselves.

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:19.230
Second thing is animosity in the people which has been there since very long time. Now that we are Sahaja Yogis we should give it up.

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:24.562
All things, all points regarding enmity, should be cleared up.

00:13:24.562 --> 00:13:27.616
Whatever mistakes we have made should be got rid of.

00:13:27.616 --> 00:13:33.320
Whichever ill-feelings that have come in our minds about each other let it clear out,

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.383
because we have now become clean, we are now like mirrors.

00:13:36.383 --> 00:13:39.000
So, no dirt can stick to us.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.342
(Shree mataji telling to turn off )

00:13:45.342 --> 00:13:53.239
In this respect one thing should be kept in mind; how much our Mother forgives,

00:13:53.239 --> 00:14:02.893
how much She has to tolerate in this regard and how many things She tolerates, how She manages, how She accommodates all.

00:14:02.893 --> 00:14:04.951
We have our mother as our role model.

00:14:04.951 --> 00:14:07.568
If She can bear with so much, why we cannot?

00:14:07.568 --> 00:14:12.004
Why can we not bring such feelings in us as forget and forgive?

00:14:12.004 --> 00:14:16.949
Howsoever may a person be, we should respect him, and help him in his ascent and transformation.

00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:21.762
When you have this magic, you should not think about what happened in the past and who did what.

00:14:21.762 --> 00:14:30.733
Many people behave little different with newcomers. They will have you as examples as to see with how much love you interact with people.

00:14:30.733 --> 00:14:36.486
Now I think, here we may have our own land then Ashram too.

00:14:36.486 --> 00:14:41.342
But when four persons (Sahaja Yogis) are kept there they will start driving away persons whoever may come.

00:14:41.342 --> 00:14:42.716
I have seen this happening every time.

00:14:42.716 --> 00:14:46.542
Let the Ashram be set up anywhere, Sahaja Yogis who stay there ask persons who go there,” Why have you come here?

00:14:46.542 --> 00:14:52.440
Who are you? You don’t come here. You cannot stay here. This is not all right, that is not all right etc.”

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.843
This is how (rudely) the Sahaja yogis start treating them.

00:14:54.843 --> 00:14:56.296
Does it behoove of you?

00:14:56.296 --> 00:15:00.553
If this is how we start treating the people, is it proper behavior?

00:15:00.553 --> 00:15:07.178
I agree that some people are not suitable for Sahaja Yoga because they are troublemakers while some people are not capable of doing anything.

00:15:07.178 --> 00:15:12.704
We cannot afford to snub them.

00:15:12.704 --> 00:15:16.156
Slowly we should bring them all to be amongst us.

00:15:16.156 --> 00:15:25.091
Those who are bad and gone cases, I will think about them and expel them. But you should be peaceful about them.

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:27.836
First thing we should do is to bring peace in our life.

00:15:27.836 --> 00:15:30.830
We should become extremely peaceful. I always tell you.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:37.239
I agree, you have to face too many difficulties in life, but you must bring peace in life.

00:15:37.239 --> 00:15:42.167
You should give me this present on my birthday, “Shri Mataji we shall keep peace in our lives.”

00:15:42.167 --> 00:15:45.150
You should be extremely peaceful, peaceful (cool) like ice.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.764
You should be extremely tolerant.

00:15:47.764 --> 00:15:53.944
Without that it will not work out. Even after you bear with all, you will have no problem. Everything will clear out from the Sahasrara.

00:15:53.944 --> 00:15:57.319
Whatever you say, you bear with, all will go away (from the Sahasrara).

00:15:57.319 --> 00:16:03.213
So, it is better not to think much about it saying, I am distressed, I have this trouble etc. What is all this,

00:16:03.213 --> 00:16:05.593
any way!
You have become saints now, what distress can you have?

00:16:05.593 --> 00:16:07.769
Can distress (or sorrow?) stay with a saint?

00:16:07.769 --> 00:16:19.618
You should now have a conviction; now that we have become saints, we have become very great, how can afflictions and distresses, stay with us?

00:16:19.618 --> 00:16:25.965
We are the ones who heal others’ afflictions, like soap we wash all. How can we become dirty?

00:16:25.965 --> 00:16:31.389
Once you have this firm conviction first thing you will have, is peace.

00:16:31.389 --> 00:16:35.222
(Shree mataji telling something to turn off)

00:16:35.222 --> 00:16:37.631
First thing, you will become peaceful within.

00:16:37.631 --> 00:16:41.803
And as soon as you are peaceful you will start seeing everything in the proper perspective.

00:16:41.803 --> 00:16:47.146
So long as peace is not established within, you will not be able to see anything in the proper perspective but will see it upside down.

00:16:47.146 --> 00:17:00.088
Forming an opinion about someone, assessing a situation are such things that if your mind is upset you will not be able to see them clearly.

00:17:00.088 --> 00:17:01.821
Hence you should have peace established within.

00:17:01.821 --> 00:17:03.429
Pray for peace.

00:17:03.429 --> 00:17:06.376
Mother has told you to be peaceful.

00:17:06.376 --> 00:17:16.714
When you become peaceful you will understand how relationships are formed, how all joy comes, how friendships are formed, how things work out.

00:17:16.714 --> 00:17:25.896
When you are disturbed, the angels who hover above you, all the arrangements that I have made for you- cannot understand what to do with such people.

00:17:25.896 --> 00:17:28.595
Suddenly they are in a haste and hurry.

00:17:28.595 --> 00:17:34.084
Some people are such that they are not peevish but for everything they will say, “Where should I keep it, here or there?”

00:17:34.084 --> 00:17:35.758
Their hands are always moving like this.

00:17:35.758 --> 00:17:37.933
It shows disturbed mind.

00:17:37.933 --> 00:17:40.990
Some persons are irritable, which is also a disturbed mind.

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:48.272
There is a variety of disturbed minds; some persons do not express their anger and suddenly it bursts out.

00:17:48.272 --> 00:17:51.570
Some people become morose.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.464
Is it the sign of a saint?

00:17:53.464 --> 00:17:56.133
Saints come into the world to give.

00:17:56.133 --> 00:17:57.636
They want to give to others.

00:17:57.636 --> 00:18:06.160
Persons who go to them should get compassion, should get love, should get satisfaction, should get protection!

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:12.308
And mainly, the person should feel peaceful, he should say, “I met so and so and felt so peaceful! How peaceful he himself is!”

00:18:12.308 --> 00:18:18.742
One may be a great scholar, but have you ever heard, that people touch the feet of those who have mastered the Vedas?

00:18:18.742 --> 00:18:26.800
On the other hand, they will fall at the feet of a faqir or sadhu if seen on road!

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:32.620
Howsoever erudite may you be in Sahaja Yoga but of what use it is if you are not peaceful?

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:37.395
Who will regard you as sadhu if you do not have peaceful attention?

00:18:37.395 --> 00:18:42.221
This should be remembered.

00:18:42.221 --> 00:18:47.455
First thing is, dignity and peace should be ingrained in a person (Sahaja Yogi) and should manifest in his demeanors.

00:18:47.455 --> 00:18:54.880
Frivolousness, all the time giggling is very common in Sahaja Yogis since they are joyful within.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.484
But giggling is improper.

00:18:56.484 --> 00:18:59.187
One should keep to his dignity.

00:18:59.187 --> 00:19:04.070
It should be inbuilt in one’s lifestyle and seen in how one conducts oneself.

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:08.489
Secondly, if anything is negative in us, its effects are reflected in the behavior.

00:19:08.489 --> 00:19:12.113
If a person is negative, he or she will always make mistakes.

00:19:12.113 --> 00:19:15.380
A mistake in this, a mistake in that, somewhere or the other he will keep making mistakes.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:18.466
Then he says, “How did it happen Shri Mataji? How did I make that mistake?”

00:19:18.466 --> 00:19:19.877
How did you make that mistake?

00:19:19.877 --> 00:19:24.560
Something has to be wrong in you otherwise why would it happen? What is wrong?

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.828
“There is negativity in me. I have negativity, is it not? Then I shall take it out!”

00:19:27.828 --> 00:19:32.724
But you should not come and tell Shri Mataji, “Shri Mataji what can I do, I do everything, but it does not work out!”

00:19:32.724 --> 00:19:35.220
You do everything but not from your heart.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:39.596
If whatever you do is not from your heart, then its results do not reach you.

00:19:39.596 --> 00:19:44.140
I have seen of a plethora of men, they told me, “Shri Mataji we work so hard, but negativity does not leave us”.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.390
How will the negativity not leave?

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:49.859
You are not the negativity, then how it will not leave?

00:19:49.859 --> 00:19:53.039
Everything can be thrown out, provided one makes efforts.

00:19:53.039 --> 00:20:01.040
Quite a number of half-baked persons are in the Sahaja Yoga even now.  So you should take care.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:05.087
Some of them have joined the Sahaja Yoga due to the temptation of making money.

00:20:05.087 --> 00:20:13.820
Some people come with the hope that they will able to make money, or get prominence or will move on the stage, or be able to show their smartness or get leadership.

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:22.237
But they will also change, realizing that their falsehood is known to all, and it is meaningless and people laugh at them.

00:20:22.237 --> 00:20:24.970
Many such, big guns (guys?) hang around.

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:30.411
One gentleman was to go to Delhi to attend My program.

00:20:30.411 --> 00:20:35.281
He said, “I cannot go to Delhi. I am very busy. I am so and so. This has happened and that has happened”.

00:20:35.281 --> 00:20:53.636
So, a Sahaja Yogini-she was small (in height)  but wise- said, “Tell that man to take even one program, as Shri Mataji has done, at Mavlankar hall and see whether even four persons attend.

00:20:53.636 --> 00:20:54.304
Nobody will come even if he offers money.

00:20:54.304 --> 00:21:01.858
You may be a minister or some big shot, but four persons will not come at your programs even after you have paid money.

00:21:01.858 --> 00:21:13.361
What do you think you are? Do you have any authority over anyone? Do you love anyone? Does anyone have regards for you from the heart? Nobody will come.

00:21:13.361 --> 00:21:16.734
As you are a minister some may come to flatter you.

00:21:16.734 --> 00:21:24.072
But you arrange your program at Mavlankar hall, not even four persons will turn up even after advertising and spending lacs of rupees.

00:21:24.072 --> 00:21:27.526
Attendance by four persons will be a big thing, owing to your good luck.”

00:21:27.526 --> 00:21:38.191
It means such persons who take leadership, think no end of themselves, who think they are special, show their own smartness, are finally pulled down.

00:21:38.191 --> 00:21:40.726
It always happens in the ashrams, too.

00:21:40.726 --> 00:21:44.547
Such a person thinks himself to be a special one and starts behaving like a special one.

00:21:44.547 --> 00:21:49.203
But he who thinks he is special is a big fool.

00:21:49.203 --> 00:21:51.679
All laugh at him, “Ha Ha.. see! He has climbed the green gram bush” (Saying in Marathi meaning that the person is boasting about himself).

00:21:51.679 --> 00:21:54.393
In Marathi all these words are there.

00:21:54.393 --> 00:21:59.135
"He has climbed the green gram bush”. The viceroy sat on the raft.

00:21:59.135 --> 00:22:02.805
Then everyone understands how the person is.

00:22:02.805 --> 00:22:12.840
Thus, everyone knows everything about everyone,

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.576
and no one has any respect for such a person.

00:22:14.576 --> 00:22:24.910
By pretending that someone is great or giving oneself a false prestige, nobody gets respect from others because everyone is quite intelligent.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:29.241
You can fool others for some days but then others will beat you with shoes, spit at you.

00:22:29.241 --> 00:22:35.620
Today they are (at the helm of affairs) flying in the sky  and the second day they fall into the ditches. Why does it happen?

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.122
One should think about it.

00:22:37.122 --> 00:22:40.342
Why do these kinds of people meet with this fate?

00:22:40.342 --> 00:22:43.711
Today they are at  a higher position so why do they suddenly fall down?

00:22:43.711 --> 00:22:51.159
The reason is that falsehood has a specialty that it is disgusting and comes to light one day or other.

00:22:51.159 --> 00:22:55.022
Those who are praising you and pampering you are false.

00:22:55.022 --> 00:22:57.090
They are bound to fall, and you will also fall.

00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:04.269
So, when the Kundalini is awakened within us, we can say Chandi has been awakened in this country.

00:23:04.269 --> 00:23:06.514
What does it mean?

00:23:06.514 --> 00:23:11.507
When the Kundalini has been awakened, we have to be straight forward and truthful.

00:23:11.507 --> 00:23:16.120
If somebody tries to play falsehood, he will certainly fall.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.937
We need not worry.

00:23:17.937 --> 00:23:21.344
He will be exposed in front of all. See how fake he is and he has these faults.

00:23:21.344 --> 00:23:28.246
They all will be uncovered. This is one part of Sahaja Yoga of throwing special light.

00:23:28.246 --> 00:23:36.545
So, when new people come and you find some of them are false seekers, they are hiding, they have come for money, let it be anything.

00:23:36.545 --> 00:23:39.331
You don’t worry about them.

00:23:39.331 --> 00:23:48.273
I will think about them. I will put them all right. But you should be dignified, like a king.

00:23:48.273 --> 00:23:52.766
Let anybody behave as he likes but you should keep to your dignity.

00:23:52.766 --> 00:23:58.073
If this is how you are decorous then nobody can touch you.

00:23:58.073 --> 00:24:05.247
But people squabble on minor issues, on small things. “Shri Mataji spoke in Marathi. Why did She speak in Hindi?

00:24:05.247 --> 00:24:06.385
She should speak only in Marathi.”

00:24:06.385 --> 00:24:13.065
But Hindi is our national language. And see these people, these foreigners.

00:24:13.065 --> 00:24:17.725
Probably they did not know that there is a language called Marathi in the world.

00:24:17.725 --> 00:24:20.541
Yet they silently listen to Me.

00:24:20.541 --> 00:24:28.682
You should learn from them as they have climbed on the green gram bush much more than you have and fallen repeatedly.

00:24:28.682 --> 00:24:36.914
They have borne with the hits of chisel and have thus become God’s statues.

00:24:36.914 --> 00:24:41.246
You have to fall down as yet, but why should you climb so as to fall.

00:24:41.246 --> 00:24:50.455
No need to ride on the paper horse. Why do you want to land up in that condition and face discomfiture?

00:24:50.455 --> 00:24:52.194
All such persons have to face their discomfitures.

00:24:52.194 --> 00:24:57.746
So, be wise and do not show off and pretend to be a big person.

00:24:57.746 --> 00:25:02.624
You may be moneyed  but in Sahaja Yoga you cannot purchase Shri Mataji.

00:25:02.624 --> 00:25:08.086
If you are  be wherever you are. If you are a minister and want to show your importance show in your house.

00:25:08.086 --> 00:25:13.838
Howsoever big you may be, it has no importance here. Here main thing is: where is your Kundalini,

00:25:13.838 --> 00:25:18.445
what is your state in Sahaja Yoga, which chakra you have evolved most (Siddha).

00:25:18.445 --> 00:25:20.616
One who has achieved all is great. Others are not.

00:25:20.616 --> 00:25:22.345
This is the kingdom of sadhus and saints.

00:25:22.345 --> 00:25:26.362
Here all extraneous things are better kept outside.

00:25:26.362 --> 00:25:33.190
Which car you have come in, how much money you have spent, what you have done cannot impress anybody.

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:41.647
Always it is your state, your level of being a sadhu or saint that has impressed the world.

00:25:41.647 --> 00:25:43.740
That should be seen, and you should become like them.

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:54.192
I had been to Agra. It is such a huge royal palace and fort but when it was dark they were felt like haunted places.

00:25:54.192 --> 00:25:55.720
There is absolutely nothing.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.720
Many powerful kings and their queens lived there.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.720
Which beautiful ornaments they must have worn, what caprices their men folk must have indulged into.

00:26:02.753 --> 00:26:06.926
Whatever it was, but all was over. As we came out, we saw a grave where a flame lamp was burning.

00:26:06.926 --> 00:26:09.401
In that light we could climb down. There was no other light in that area.

00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:15.923
When asked whose grave it was, they said he was a faqir and Guru to emperor Akbar.

00:26:15.923 --> 00:26:21.946
But since he never entered the palace the emperor built his grave at that place.

00:26:21.946 --> 00:26:23.086
What a great thing it is!

00:26:23.086 --> 00:26:32.680
Even now a lamp is lit at the grave of that man, while the palace has no light and it is in pitch dark.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:38.119
Nobody knows who kings and queens and whose graves were there. Whatever was bygone was bygone.

00:26:38.119 --> 00:26:43.815
So, what is that which permanently stays after the man?

00:26:43.815 --> 00:26:47.485
It is his glory, and that glory is in his spirit.

00:26:47.485 --> 00:26:51.654
We have to achieve that through Sahaja Yoga. Unlike other people we do not want to achieve material glory,

00:26:51.654 --> 00:26:55.200
which is transient, but we want to get that which is eternal.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.160
And having achieved it, we have to distribute it, we have to give it to the people, have to cure the people.

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:04.170
Let the people be benefited. We should compassionately view them and treat them with love.

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:14.954
Once it starts growing, we can set right the condition of not just this country but that of hundreds.

00:27:14.954 --> 00:27:19.513
But first of all, you should be ready. I will not be able to do it alone.

00:27:19.513 --> 00:27:29.924
For example, I speak through this microphone but something more is necessary to carry its sound.

00:27:29.924 --> 00:27:31.025
Same with you.

00:27:31.025 --> 00:27:40.563
If you are completely hollow, then this power will so beautifully flow through you that it will be as what I said yesterday;

00:27:40.563 --> 00:27:43.486
the time has come for this to happen. The lotus of the universe has to open.

00:27:43.486 --> 00:27:53.139
The thousand petal lotus (the Sahasrara or the Sahasradala Kamal) of the universe has to open.

00:27:53.139 --> 00:27:55.388
For that, you are each petal of that lotus.

00:27:55.388 --> 00:27:57.565
It is not very difficult job.

00:27:57.565 --> 00:28:03.323
All should do little hard work viz meditation, and the chakra cleansing.

00:28:03.323 --> 00:28:08.017
Take your house as the Ashram and yourself as the residents of the Ashram.

00:28:08.017 --> 00:28:16.677
Getting up early in the morning and completing meditation and Puja, proceed with your routine chores. Then meditate in the evening too.

00:28:16.677 --> 00:28:21.371
You should also go at public programs.

00:28:21.371 --> 00:28:25.070
See whether you can open a meditation centre in that area and start one, if you can.

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:27.942
Make friends with people, invite them to Sahaja Yoga centers. Invite ladies for get-togethers (known as the Haldi-Kumkum programs)

00:28:27.942 --> 00:28:32.605
and tell them about Sahaja Yoga, that Shri Mataji has given us the Sahaja Yoga and we have had these benefits.

00:28:32.605 --> 00:28:37.306
Share the good news of Sahaja Yoga with as many people as possible. This way you should, spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:37.306 --> 00:28:42.878
You should be kind and loving with those who are still half-baked and guide them such as, “Do this way so that you will be better.”

00:28:42.878 --> 00:28:44.548
Getting irritated with them will not help.

00:28:44.548 --> 00:28:47.688
They need to be guided with love and affection. This is the first thing which I tell you.

00:28:47.688 --> 00:28:54.141
Connect with all with love. Your loving style of interaction impresses them most.

00:28:54.141 --> 00:28:57.177
Once I told a lady to go to Delhi to the ashram.

00:28:57.177 --> 00:29:00.160
She told me, “Shri Mataji, it’s all monkeys’ rule there

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:05.013
and I do not want to go among the monkeys.

00:29:05.013 --> 00:29:07.074
How (kindly) you deal with the people and how those monkeys do!”

00:29:07.074 --> 00:29:10.008
I did not understand as to how monkeys live there.

00:29:10.008 --> 00:29:15.793
So, she said, “Whosoever I talked to, had already climbed the green gram bush.”

00:29:15.793 --> 00:29:19.448
I replied, “All right, I will talk to them, and it will ok”.

00:29:19.448 --> 00:29:29.096
I tell you, it would not be so bad, but see how our behavior impresses the people. A little snobbishness by you spoils the impression.

00:29:29.096 --> 00:29:31.229
You should be extremely humble.

00:29:31.229 --> 00:29:38.800
Secondly, I want to tell you, you should be conforming to Indian tradition.

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:47.776
Suppose, we set up ashram here and a jeans clad lady with western hair style is there and greeting visitors with “Hi..” then the visitors will think,” What is this ashram”?

00:29:47.776 --> 00:29:52.237
Ours is not a modern ashram. Ours is a ashram of ancient traditions.

00:29:52.237 --> 00:29:58.939
We may bring modern gadgets and know modern methods, but that does not mean we should follow modern ways of life.

00:29:58.939 --> 00:30:03.690
We will not do that. Being traditional modern is different from being glamorous.

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:06.223
Sahaja Yoga does not accept glamour.

00:30:06.223 --> 00:30:07.733
Glamour is not all acceptable in Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:07.733 --> 00:30:12.816
However, being traditional is not for a married woman to bear weird looks.

00:30:12.816 --> 00:30:17.648
It is decided that even widows should be properly dressed up according to traditions.

00:30:17.648 --> 00:30:24.005
So, we have to be traditional. Men should also be traditional and not show off like Sahibs wearing suits and ties.

00:30:24.005 --> 00:30:33.345
Only the other day I told, that to get the bearing of a Sahib somebody wore a bow,

00:30:33.345 --> 00:30:35.654
but the people around him thought that he was a bearer!

00:30:35.654 --> 00:30:41.072
Nobody thought that a sahib had come although he had spent lot of money on the bow.

00:30:41.072 --> 00:30:42.134
What is the need for all this?

00:30:42.134 --> 00:30:46.794
We have beautiful clothes that have come to us by tradition in our country.

00:30:46.794 --> 00:30:51.575
When we wear them, they are comfortable and keep us cool, as well as appear decent and beautiful.

00:30:51.575 --> 00:30:57.518
So, it is not at all necessary to blindly follow others. As far as possible one should keep to traditions.

00:30:57.518 --> 00:31:05.782
Especially, in the ashrams the traditions should be followed to welcome the visitors and interact with them.

00:31:05.782 --> 00:31:08.527
We don’t have such words as, “Get out”.

00:31:08.527 --> 00:31:15.335
We never utter the words, like, “Get out” and every now and then ask, “What’s wrong”.

00:31:15.335 --> 00:31:20.278
Nor do we say, “I hate you”. Had we ever spoken these words our father would have thrashed us.

00:31:20.278 --> 00:31:25.834
The expression, “I hate you” is frequently used in the English language. You say, “I hate you”, who are you to say this?

00:31:25.834 --> 00:31:29.449
If someone utters its Marathi translation, “Malaa tujhi ghrunaa waatate (मला तुझी घृणा वाटते – I hate you)”

00:31:29.449 --> 00:31:35.262
our people will thrash you and respond, ”Is it so? We will set right your nose.”

00:31:35.262 --> 00:31:42.160
This is the way they speak in the west. We will not learn this English style or the western style. It is not good.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.375
What do they mean by, “I hate you”? This is not our way of talking.

00:31:45.375 --> 00:31:51.280
If there is a visitor we welcome him with the words,” What a great fortune of ours that you have come. Please come in. What can I do for you?”

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:55.413
You know, King Harishchandra gifted his whole kingdom.

00:31:55.413 --> 00:31:57.443
His child was killed!

00:31:57.443 --> 00:32:01.600
We used to give whatever our guest asked for.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:05.555
But now we do not want this style of the English or the westerner.

00:32:05.555 --> 00:32:10.698
Never allow these terrible, abusive words to set on your tongue.

00:32:10.698 --> 00:32:16.959
We should use gentle and respectful language to interact as people from innocent families do.

00:32:16.959 --> 00:32:20.058
Your mother is extremely innocent and so you should also be.

00:32:20.058 --> 00:32:24.427
I am surprised when I hear people use bad words.

00:32:24.427 --> 00:32:26.505
Now your mothers are changed. Now I am your mother.

00:32:26.505 --> 00:32:31.889
If your mother uses bad words you should forget about it and imbibe My way.

00:32:31.889 --> 00:32:33.739
You should never ever use harsh or bad language.

00:32:33.739 --> 00:32:40.684
The main point I want to emphasize is that the light of love and peace should completely manifest from you.

00:32:40.684 --> 00:32:44.305
Others should say that such and such person is love and peace personified.

00:32:44.305 --> 00:32:49.690
I shall be very glad to hear these words.

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:54.113
So, today, I ask (request) from you the gift of love and peace.
