00:02.611 --> 00:07.167
Birthday Puja 1984-0322, Bombay (India)

32:55.707 --> 32:59.683
I have just told them (Indian Sahaja Yogis)
that you should not try to copy

32:59.892 --> 33:04.902
the western style of ego-oriented society
where people use harsh words,

33:05.103 --> 33:07.855
because then we think that we have
modernized ourselves, you see.

33:08.056 --> 33:13.123
To say harsh words to somebody,
“What do I care! I hate you!”

33:13.324 --> 33:17.424
All these sentences we have never used,
you see, which is unknown to us.

33:17.625 --> 33:20.116
I mean, anybody to say like that is
unmannerliness.

33:20.317 --> 33:22.582
How can you say such a thing:
“I hate you!”?

33:22.783 --> 33:25.713
But now I have heard people talking like
this in our country.

33:25.914 --> 33:32.190
"I hate you." “What's wrong with us?”
“Who are you to say that?”

33:32.391 --> 33:36.073
Like that we don't talk. You see, this is
not the way to talk at all.

33:36.274 --> 33:38.968
Any person who comes from a good family

33:39.169 --> 33:42.311
would not talk like this because it
reflects on the family.

33:42.512 --> 33:45.985
But the language is more copied here
than there.

33:46.186 --> 33:48.934
I am surprised sometimes when I hear
the people [how] they talk

33:49.135 --> 33:52.341
in the buses, in the taxies, in the things;

33:52.542 --> 33:55.669
the way they use language is, you see,
is something I can’t understand.

33:55.870 --> 33:58.696
So I have asked them that the language
should be full of love

33:58.897 --> 34:01.491
and with our own traditional style,
the way...

34:01.692 --> 34:04.068
You see, we wouldn’t even scold
our children.

34:04.269 --> 34:08.204
If you have to scold the children, we use
a language

34:08.405 --> 34:13.209
which makes them over honourable
(Bahumanarthi):

34:13.410 --> 34:16.258
[(Marathi)

34:16.459 --> 34:22.446
Damle Sahab has put on a kurta pyjama,
so, “You are looking like Shivaji Maharaj.

34:22.647 --> 34:24.399
Welcome Shivaji Maharaj”.

34:24.600 --> 34:28.267
We should speak in such respectful language
so that they would not get scared.

34:28.468 --> 34:31.591
Correction if it is to be done], we used
to do it this way;

34:31.792 --> 34:37.379
but the correction of the other side is not
proper because that never it corrects.

34:37.580 --> 34:39.861
You see, that’s why you cannot control
your children.

34:40.062 --> 34:44.127
You are all the time insulting them,
insulting others, insulting methods,

34:44.328 --> 34:47.901
you see, and this emotional blackmail
and all this nonsense

34:48.102 --> 34:51.248
is not at all traditional in this country.

34:51.449 --> 34:53.262
And those who'll try to do it will be
thrown out.

34:53.463 --> 34:56.017
I can tell you, in Sahaja Yoga you cannot
work out.

34:56.218 --> 35:00.093
You should not have all these ideas
of insulting people,

35:00.294 --> 35:04.338
of bringing them into situations where they
can be insulted. This is all modern style.

35:04.539 --> 35:07.676
So we should not do like that
in Sahaja Yoga.

35:07.877 --> 35:12.498
We should behave in such a way that
we should be dignified people.

35:12.699 --> 35:17.445
Behoving our style is our tradition,
is Sahaja Yogis' tradition is this

35:17.646 --> 35:20.920
that we talk to people in the most
sophisticated manner,

35:21.121 --> 35:27.035
in the sweetest manner, in the most
affectionate manner and inviting manner.

35:27.236 --> 35:30.341
And that is how we all should speak.
So, this is [the] first thing I ask

35:30.542 --> 35:32.772
that in your expression of your love

35:32.957 --> 35:35.648
there should not be a thing that you
should shout.

35:35.849 --> 35:38.651
Now, I do shout at some people who have
bhoots in them,

35:38.852 --> 35:44.294
but by that the bhoots run away. But if
you shout, you get the bhoots.

35:45.066 --> 35:48.218
The bhoots don't run away, they get
at you; so better not do it.

35:48.419 --> 35:50.673
If you have My powers you can do that;
but you don’t have.

35:50.874 --> 35:55.092
If you shout at the person who has bhoots,
you get the bhoots.

35:55.293 --> 35:59.934
So be careful, don’t try My tricks. You
see, I am a different type of a person

36:00.135 --> 36:03.221
and I do everything so understandingly,
which you do not.

36:03.422 --> 36:07.311
So, when you follow Me, you should
follow Me the way I am,

36:07.512 --> 36:09.856
on the side where I forgive,

36:10.057 --> 36:13.873
the way I am loving, I am affectionate;
not where I am terrible.

36:14.074 --> 36:18.123
You shouldn't do that because My terrible
nature has got the undercurrent

36:18.324 --> 36:21.139
of My Love, which you don’t have,
and you don’t have these powers.

36:21.347 --> 36:23.805
So don’t try those tricks with anybody
else.

36:24.006 --> 36:27.061
You have no right to shout at anyone
or to get angry,

36:27.262 --> 36:30.619
because if you shout, you get back
all these bhoots into you.

36:30.820 --> 36:34.647
They want, they provoke you. They provoke
you so that you get caught up into it

36:34.848 --> 36:38.535
and you get absolutely ruined, the more
you try to do it.

36:38.736 --> 36:45.807
So, the best thing is to stand in
the centre and have affection and love -

36:46.023 --> 36:49.956
the power that I have given you. That you
have [to] develop - that power of love.

36:50.157 --> 36:53.657
First you develop that power of love.
Then you don’t have to worry,

36:53.858 --> 36:56.525
you don’t have to shout, you don't have
to say anything.

36:56.726 --> 37:01.237
Your power will become the Krita (active),
it will work out itself

37:01.438 --> 37:04.711
and create that beautiful atmosphere
that we want to do.

37:04.912 --> 37:06.769
We don't want anybody to be ruined.

37:06.970 --> 37:09.808
But if you start shouting at people,
they’ll all run away.

37:10.009 --> 37:14.020
Specially in the ego-oriented society,
you should not shout at all!

37:14.221 --> 37:16.032
That will not appeal to anyone.

37:16.233 --> 37:19.535
If you shout at anyone in the ego-oriented
society,

37:19.736 --> 37:22.189
you will always distract them and they'll
run away.

37:22.390 --> 37:26.194
So I have to tell you, that you might be
the highest of highest,

37:26.395 --> 37:30.675
first thing [that] you have to give Me
today is that in your talk,

37:30.876 --> 37:37.385
in your behaviour, in your heart, you will
reside one with Love.

37:37.586 --> 37:42.002
And the second thing I want to ask is that
you should be peaceful people.

37:42.211 --> 37:45.734
Try to have peace with yourself.
Don’t fight with yourself.

37:45.935 --> 37:50.214
Now, the western people have one problem
[that] they fight with themselves.

37:50.415 --> 37:53.652
“How is it this is happening to me?
I am so bad. I am no good.

37:53.853 --> 37:55.383
I have done this. I am so bad.”

37:55.584 --> 37:59.044
If you go on fighting with yourself,
then you will become week.

37:59.245 --> 38:01.922
On the contrary, you must say, “I am
so good. What’s wrong with me?

38:02.130 --> 38:04.651
I’ve got realization. What’s wrong with me?

38:04.852 --> 38:07.294
Have that confidence in oneself, and then
it will work out.

38:07.495 --> 38:10.810
And as result of that only you start
shouting at others.

38:11.011 --> 38:13.220
But supposing you understand

38:13.421 --> 38:16.397
that there is nothing wrong with you,
you have to be peaceful.

38:16.598 --> 38:19.582
We all have to be very peaceful people
and you have seen,

38:19.783 --> 38:23.737
My peaceful nature has solved so many
problems just like that.

38:23.938 --> 38:29.530
So try to achieve that peace within you.
That peace should not be lost at any cost,

38:29.731 --> 38:34.048
and should not be also expressed outside
in a way, like I sometimes.

38:34.249 --> 38:38.069
My peace itself becomes terrible.

38:38.270 --> 38:41.859
But you don’t have that kind of
a possibility, so you just don’t do it.

38:42.060 --> 38:44.713
You just don’t do it, never do it that way.

38:44.914 --> 38:50.574
Try to be extremely peaceful, try to make
your forehead relaxed.

38:50.775 --> 38:53.341
Many people come to Me with [face]
like this, you see,

38:53.542 --> 38:56.607
then I just know that there is a big bhoot
on the head sitting;

38:56.808 --> 38:58.788
then I shout at them.

38:58.989 --> 39:01.778
Keep your forehead relaxed, relaxed.

39:01.979 --> 39:05.646
“I am not doing anything, Mother is doing
everything. Relax, relax, relax.”

39:05.847 --> 39:11.384
If you relax, you’ll find that your heart
will open.

39:11.585 --> 39:14.952
“My heart cannot open.” Why, why can’t
you open your heart?

39:15.153 --> 39:18.567
Because you have no trust in yourself.

39:18.768 --> 39:23.199
Try to trust yourself, open your Agnya,
open your Ekadasha

39:23.400 --> 39:29.154
and your Sahasrara, and your heart will
open. Once your Sahasrara is open,

39:29.355 --> 39:33.416
your heart will open automatically, so
you will have a peaceful life.

39:33.617 --> 39:36.341
So today I am asking for two things
from you.

39:36.542 --> 39:39.778
It's a funny thing that a Mother has to ask
for a gift.

39:39.955 --> 39:44.317
And the gift you have to give - first one -
is that you should be peaceful people.

39:44.518 --> 39:49.520
You should express peacefulness through
your own character, talking.

39:49.721 --> 39:54.183
But it doesn't mean that you should be
people who are bleak,

39:54.384 --> 40:00.915
or who are - we can say that - are
morbid people

40:01.116 --> 40:05.577
or people who tolerate nonsense.
No, there is a way of resistance.

40:05.778 --> 40:09.576
But a resistance, of a peaceful resistance,
that you are not afraid of anything;

40:09.777 --> 40:13.078
you are not frightened of anything; you are
not going to bow down to anything;

40:13.279 --> 40:17.048
you are not going to compromise with
anything, but you are peaceful.

40:17.249 --> 40:20.833
That sort of a temperament you must
develop

40:21.034 --> 40:23.523
and also express outside, is very
important.

40:23.724 --> 40:33.426
And [the] second one is the..., this peace
and all this

40:33.627 --> 40:38.492
should express your love to others,
love to others.

40:38.693 --> 40:42.554
Like now, everywhere, within next one
or two years we'll have ashrams,

40:42.755 --> 40:46.169
I am sure of that. And in the ashram,
I would like to see

40:46.370 --> 40:52.564
people having loving, caring, affectionate,
patronising,

40:52.770 --> 40:56.028
beautiful attitude towards the people who
come there.

40:56.238 --> 41:00.160
On the contrary, if you do not have, your
ashrams will be all reduced to zero.

41:00.361 --> 41:03.118
It has happened in many places; it will
happen everywhere.

41:03.319 --> 41:06.241
So, you don’t blame Me, “Why our ashrams
don’t run good?”

41:06.442 --> 41:10.642
It will be your responsibility to see that
it is your Mother’s House

41:10.843 --> 41:16.986
and people are coming to the Mother’s
House. And how a Mother would treat

41:17.187 --> 41:20.404
these people with love, affection,
with whatever you have.

41:20.605 --> 41:23.687
You can starve, but give to others,
look after them.

41:23.911 --> 41:28.667
Give them all the kindness and sweetness,
so the impression of people...

41:28.868 --> 41:31.908
Even if you are slightest not like that,
people will think,

41:32.109 --> 41:34.919
"This is a very arrogant personality.
And how can it be?"

41:35.120 --> 41:38.408
So you have to be a top class person to be
in charge of an ashram.

41:38.609 --> 41:42.361
If a person who is a mediocre, he should
not appoint.

41:42.562 --> 41:46.380
By God’s grace, I'm sure, by next year
you'll have all the lands in your hand,

41:46.581 --> 41:51.226
and all your ashrams will start by next
year in every country.

41:51.427 --> 41:54.079
May God bless you.

41:54.280 --> 41:57.124
This is what I give you on My birthday
today

41:57.325 --> 42:02.619
that you all will have your ashrams properly
established by the end of next year.

42:02.820 --> 42:06.197
But first two things you must...,
the conditions are there.

42:06.398 --> 42:09.659
First two conditions should be there.
If you are not good for that,

42:09.860 --> 42:11.982
God will never give you an ashram,

42:12.183 --> 42:15.939
because He doesn’t want to give ashram
to some funny people.

42:16.140 --> 42:19.552
It's become sort of a recluse for people
who have no place anywhere

42:19.753 --> 42:22.354
[to] come and sit in the ashram.

42:22.555 --> 42:24.900
So unless and until you have people
of that level,

42:25.101 --> 42:29.617
who will remain peaceful and loving,
you will not establish.

42:29.818 --> 42:33.545
But if you do, I’m sure, by next year
you should be able

42:33.746 --> 42:36.624
to have ashrams in every place.

42:36.848 --> 42:39.546
May God Bless you.
