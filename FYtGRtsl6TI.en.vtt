00:55:07.553 --> 00:55:20.953
Our honored guest, our respected Home Affairs Ministry is here,

00:55:22.092 --> 00:55:28.926
Mr. Advani, who has been always a very great dezabhakt [patriot].

00:55:28.926 --> 00:55:34.826
I admired him because he loved his country; he is very patriotic.

00:55:35.324 --> 00:55:38.124
And this is ...

00:55:53.810 --> 00:56:01.710
And as you know, my father and mother both were very patriotic.

00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:05.110
They sacrificed everything for the country,

00:56:05.283 --> 00:56:12.583
and I also was always condemned by everyone
as being a very patriotic person.

00:56:21.111 --> 00:56:25.511
We must love the country in which we are born.

00:56:25.938 --> 00:56:33.238
There is some connection, very great connection,
between yourself and your country.

00:56:33.238 --> 00:56:37.938
And I have seen that after Sahaja Yoga, all those

00:56:38.168 --> 00:56:43.868
who have been transformed into new visions and new ideas

00:56:43.868 --> 00:56:50.368
always know what’s wrong in their own country. And so conscious of it!

00:56:50.853 --> 00:56:56.253
I am surprised that every one of them have been able to tell Me

00:56:56.253 --> 00:57:00.253
what’s wrong in their country and what should be done.

00:57:00.411 --> 00:57:08.111
They never identified with the wrongs or the misdeeds of their country.

00:57:08.111 --> 00:57:09.911
It’s very surprising.

00:57:10.211 --> 00:57:14.511
On the contrary they said, “Mother, all these countries

00:57:14.724 --> 00:57:18.824
require Your attention so that they should be corrected.”

00:57:18.824 --> 00:57:21.324
Their politicians should be corrected.

00:57:21.324 --> 00:57:23.924
Their citizens should be corrected

00:57:24.168 --> 00:57:33.968
and that people should really evolve into a new consciousness.

00:57:34.553 --> 00:57:37.453
All of them have been working it out.

00:57:37.453 --> 00:57:41.753
Now we have here very few Sahaja Yogis from abroad,

00:57:41.911 --> 00:57:46.311
but I tell you it’s surprising how these Sahaja Yogis

00:57:46.311 --> 00:57:52.711
have enlightened thousands and thousands
of Sahaja Yogis all over the world.

00:57:52.983 --> 00:57:57.083
They are the ones who are working. I am not working like them.

00:57:57.239 --> 00:58:04.939
They work very hard. You can see the way we have got these felicitations from all these people,

00:58:05.196 --> 00:58:11.369
all because they approached these people, told them all about Sahaja Yoga,

00:58:11.369 --> 00:58:14.169
they might have even given them Realization.

00:58:14.383 --> 00:58:17.483
And that’s how they have worked it out.

00:58:17.483 --> 00:58:23.283
So, we have to worry about our own country and its own problems.

00:58:23.283 --> 00:58:25.483
Why these problems are there?

00:58:25.483 --> 00:58:30.683
And I tell you, your wishes and your efforts

00:58:30.812 --> 00:58:36.212
will definitely improve the conditions of your own countries.

00:58:36.512 --> 00:58:42.112
And it’s happening in everywhere, also should happen in India.

00:58:43.110 --> 00:58:53.476
Once we are Realized souls, it is our most important duty is, first of all,

00:58:53.604 --> 00:59:01.356
look after your own societies,  look after your own country.

00:59:01.811 --> 00:59:07.111
If you can’t do that, what’s the use of getting Self-realization?

00:59:07.424 --> 00:59:13.124
Because Self-realization stands on one power -
and the power of love.

00:59:13.253 --> 00:59:18.053
And one art - art of selfless love.

00:59:18.368 --> 00:59:22.768
If that is there, immediately you start seeing the people

00:59:22.768 --> 00:59:26.568
who are surrounding you, who are in your village,

00:59:26.568 --> 00:59:33.268
who are also in the neighborhood,

00:59:33.384 --> 00:59:38.684
or also who are in your city and in your country.

00:59:39.054 --> 00:59:47.413
Immediately you start understanding what’s the problem, even your own society.

00:59:48.011 --> 00:59:50.911
I have seen, after coming to Sahaja Yoga

00:59:51.039 --> 00:59:55.739
people have tried to improve so many things in their own society.

00:59:56.483 --> 01:00:01.383
Now we have many Hindus, many Muslims,

01:00:01.692 --> 01:00:06.392
Christians, all kinds of people, but I was amazed at one thing.

01:00:06.526 --> 01:00:15.941
Once they got Realization, they never identified
with the wrong things of their society or of their religions.

01:00:16.169 --> 01:00:20.269
On the contrary they wanted to improve it and work it out.

01:00:20.497 --> 01:00:23.697
But there’s a very simple way of doing it.

01:00:24.169 --> 01:00:32.093
You don’t have to go out of the way to change people or to  make any sacrifices,

01:00:32.093 --> 01:00:33.927
nothing of the kind.

01:00:34.911 --> 01:00:39.370
Everybody today is suffering from some sort of anxiety,

01:00:39.512 --> 01:00:45.312
some sort of problems, some sort of worries.

01:00:45.497 --> 01:00:49.497
Also they are suffering from other problems.

01:00:49.896 --> 01:00:57.296
Now if you can tell them that,
“you can be transformed, you can be transformed.”

01:00:57.439 --> 01:01:07.739
Transformed into a being which is absolutely above all these worries, above all these problems.

01:01:07.883 --> 01:01:10.783
How can that be? One can ask.

01:01:10.939 --> 01:01:15.639
Actually, what happens that when you get your Self-realization,

01:01:15.639 --> 01:01:22.939
your attention gets enlightened by the Self, means the Spirit,

01:01:23.268 --> 01:01:28.468
and automatically you start dropping your destructive habits,

01:01:28.624 --> 01:01:33.724
destructive thoughts and destructive activities.

01:01:33.724 --> 01:01:36.624
You suddenly become so constructive.

01:01:36.783 --> 01:01:41.683
Now I’ll tell you one thing, I was amazed when I was in Togliatti in Russia.

01:01:41.924 --> 01:01:48.224
A news came to Me that the head of the mafia has become a Sahaja Yogi.

01:01:50.856 --> 01:01:54.741
And I was, I was so touched by that.

01:01:55.224 --> 01:02:00.424
And he came to Me and he said, "I was doing all nonsensical things.

01:02:00.424 --> 01:02:05.424
I never got any satisfaction, no joy. But this is something.

01:02:05.424 --> 01:02:10.124
I really can feel the joy and satisfaction within myself.

01:02:10.124 --> 01:02:13.692
Mother, whatever was my past, will You forgive me?"

01:02:13.692 --> 01:02:19.692
I said, "Forgiven".

01:02:21.254 --> 01:02:26.454
"What is important is the present, and now you have become a Sahaja Yogi.

01:02:26.454 --> 01:02:33.454
It’s such a credit to your spiritual growth, the way you have achieved it."

01:02:33.911 --> 01:02:40.511
He said, "Now, I have that peace. I have that joy and I want to share it with others.

01:02:41.311 --> 01:02:45.511
I could never share my money with others.  I used to grab money from others".

01:02:45.511 --> 01:02:48.911
I said, "I don’t want to have any confessions. Finished!

01:02:49.153 --> 01:02:53.953
Now, as you have become a Sahaja Yogi, what will you do?"

01:02:54.853 --> 01:02:56.653
Surprisingly, he was very sweet.

01:02:56.653 --> 01:03:00.053
He said, "I will send some onions to India".

01:03:00.053 --> 01:03:01.353
I said, “Why?”

01:03:01.353 --> 01:03:04.853
He said, “Because there is a problem about onions.”

01:03:05.996 --> 01:03:10.996
I thought, “Look at this man, how genuine he has become, how humane.”

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:14.154
I said, "We have no such problem. You don’t worry".

01:03:14.154 --> 01:03:21.154
And then you see his way of looking at things and working out things was so tremendous

01:03:21.354 --> 01:03:25.454
that the same fellow who was a big mafia leader

01:03:25.454 --> 01:03:31.854
has become such a big, great, honorable person in that career.

01:03:32.926 --> 01:03:38.826
And then he wanted to be elected to the municipal- some elections.

01:03:39.011 --> 01:03:43.692
I said, "Go ahead. You’ll be elected.  If you are not elected, doesn’t matter".

01:03:43.692 --> 01:03:45.992
But he got elected also.

01:03:46.141 --> 01:03:53.141
So, you see how things work out for a person who wants to be the Spirit.

01:03:54.026 --> 01:03:56.926
Shivaji has said, "Swadharma Jagwawa".

01:03:57.068 --> 01:04:01.982
This is the only message he gave for the future: "Swadharma Jagwawa".

01:04:01.982 --> 01:04:05.659
"Swa" means the Spirit. You awaken your Spirit.

01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:09.269
That is what we have to achieve.

01:04:09.269 --> 01:04:11.585
Because he himself was a Realized soul.

01:04:12.892 --> 01:04:18.996
So, he said, "This is what you have to do,  is to make your Spirit awaken".

01:04:18.996 --> 01:04:25.896
Now with that light of the Spirit, what happens?

01:04:26.824 --> 01:04:33.424
You just see clearly, very clearly, you see what’s wrong with you,

01:04:33.424 --> 01:04:36.824
what’s wrong with your society, what’s wrong in your country.

01:04:36.824 --> 01:04:43.824
Everything you see very clearly, and you also have power to correct it.

01:04:44.654 --> 01:04:50.654
If you are aware of your power and if you have mastered it, you can do it.

01:04:50.654 --> 01:04:57.254
You can do it not for yourself, but for your family,
for your society, for everyone.

01:04:58.553 --> 01:05:01.353
My husband always used to say,  “You are a socialist

01:05:02.092 --> 01:05:04.992
because You can’t exist Yourself alone.

01:05:04.992 --> 01:05:09.892
You must share with others. Because, you see, You are so collective.”

01:05:10.192 --> 01:05:15.192
But the thing is, you see, we have to understand we are a collective.

01:05:15.638 --> 01:05:18.238
We cannot exist alone anywhere,

01:05:18.395 --> 01:05:21.895
we are all collective. We are not aware of it.

01:05:21.895 --> 01:05:25.595
But when you become aware of it, you are so surprised

01:05:25.692 --> 01:05:29.083
that you are part and parcel of the whole.

01:05:29.083 --> 01:05:36.883
That you don’t have to look for company
in your own society, in your own "samaja". Nothing.

01:05:37.438 --> 01:05:44.038
What you want is just to have the company of all the Sahaja Yogis,

01:05:44.038 --> 01:05:51.838
and this has proved beyond doubt that if you are spiritually awakened,

01:05:52.424 --> 01:05:58.656
you have no quarrels with each other, no hatred, no competition.

01:05:58.656 --> 01:06:02.056
I have not seen anybody doing that in Sahaja Yoga.

01:06:02.056 --> 01:06:09.756
And that is how things have become so much better
for all of you together and also outside.

01:06:09.756 --> 01:06:17.156
One of the ambassadors, she told Me that, “Mother, we are very happy.”

01:06:17.156 --> 01:06:18.025
I said, “Why?”

01:06:18.210 --> 01:06:22.310
“Because we are not competitive. So everybody is happy with us.”

01:06:22.310 --> 01:06:30.710
This is what it is: that you realize  that you don’t have to worry about getting something higher position,

01:06:30.908 --> 01:06:37.572
getting into something very rich, you can say properties. No!

01:06:38.231 --> 01:06:42.331
Because the satisfaction part is within you.

01:06:42.331 --> 01:06:47.631
You are so satisfied within yourself that you don’t run after things.

01:06:47.631 --> 01:06:52.231
Like the economics, the modern economics, as it is,

01:06:52.231 --> 01:07:01.531
it is based on one simple factor that human beings are never satisfied.

01:07:02.297 --> 01:07:08.473
Today they want something, they’ll run for it and do every sort of thing

01:07:08.473 --> 01:07:10.327
and make money, get it.

01:07:10.854 --> 01:07:13.698
Then they are not satisfied. They want to have something else.

01:07:13.698 --> 01:07:16.392
And then they want to have something else.

01:07:16.392 --> 01:07:21.492
This is the basis of economics - I mean, modern economics.

01:07:22.638 --> 01:07:24.638
But Sahaja Yoga is different.

01:07:24.638 --> 01:07:29.338
Sahaja Yoga economics is this thing: that I have got Realization.

01:07:29.338 --> 01:07:33.538
All right! I must share with others.

01:07:34.024 --> 01:07:37.924
If I have got the satisfaction, I must share with them.

01:07:38.166 --> 01:07:45.866
The sharing part is so important in Sahaja Yoga, and which people are doing with such beauty.

01:07:45.866 --> 01:07:51.466
As I told you the other day that we have to learn the art of loving.

01:07:51.683 --> 01:07:56.683
It’s very simple if you know how to say few sweet things,

01:07:56.683 --> 01:08:03.983
how to give something sweetly, how to share with others very sweetly.

01:08:04.739 --> 01:08:12.339
It is not difficult for you at all because you have got your Spirit to give you the joy.

01:08:12.524 --> 01:08:17.524
I know Sahaja Yoga has done wonders. People have given up drugs overnight.

01:08:17.524 --> 01:08:20.824
Now in America they have a proposal for us

01:08:20.824 --> 01:08:26.828
that we should start a drug addiction thing, is to remove the drug addictions,

01:08:26.828 --> 01:08:30.492
some sort of an organization and all that.

01:08:30.492 --> 01:08:34.192
And Sahaja Yogis said that, "We have one million dollar.

01:08:34.192 --> 01:08:35.992
Can we do with that?” “No, No!”

01:08:35.992 --> 01:08:38.392
they said, "We’ll give you twenty-one million dollars".

01:08:38.392 --> 01:08:41.541
“What will you do with twenty-one million dollars?” I said.

01:08:41.541 --> 01:08:44.441
“If you want to build something for the drug addiction,

01:08:44.441 --> 01:08:46.841
you only need them to come there.

01:08:46.841 --> 01:08:49.041
Overnight, they will give up their drugs".

01:08:49.041 --> 01:08:52.641
I have seen that and there are some sitting here.

01:09:01.168 --> 01:09:04.368
Such a power your Spirit has!

01:09:04.368 --> 01:09:08.768
Such a beauty it has, and such love and peace it has!

01:09:09.026 --> 01:09:14.626
Only it is to be brought into your attention which is going hither, thither, thither.

01:09:14.854 --> 01:09:20.454
Only if your attention is enlightened by the Spirit,

01:09:20.454 --> 01:09:23.654
you become such a wonderful person.

01:09:24.011 --> 01:09:29.911
All these things as they had described in Sanskrit: Kama, Krodha, Mada, Matsarya, Lobha, Moha [desire, anger, greed, pride, jealousy, attachment]

01:09:30.124 --> 01:09:33.024
all of them drop by themselves.

01:09:33.024 --> 01:09:37.024
All the anger, all the stupid things we do,

01:09:37.024 --> 01:09:41.224
and all the aggressive things we do, drops out.

01:09:41.569 --> 01:09:47.869
I have asked some Sahaja Yogis to go to Kashmir
and make them Sahaja Yogis.

01:09:48.104 --> 01:09:51.304
If you can make them Sahaja Yogis this problem will be over.

01:09:51.668 --> 01:09:54.868
And there are some willing to go there.

01:09:55.527 --> 01:09:58.527
Some foreign Sahaja Yogis specially have offered

01:09:58.811 --> 01:10:02.611
their services to go and change the people’s mind.

01:10:02.611 --> 01:10:05.881
Now we have! We have changed people,

01:10:05.881 --> 01:10:12.681
like we have now in a place called Benin, there are seven hundred -

01:10:13.139 --> 01:10:20.039
seven thousand - Muslims who were very fundamentalist,

01:10:20.039 --> 01:10:22.539
they all have become Sahaja Yogis.

01:10:25.181 --> 01:10:30.381
In Turkey, we have already two thousand Sahaja Yogis. In Turkey!

01:10:30.524 --> 01:10:34.524
So even fanaticism of any kind - among Hindus or

01:10:34.524 --> 01:10:39.424
among Muslims, among Christians - can be easily changed because

01:10:39.424 --> 01:10:44.824
they will see the beauty of their Spirit,

01:10:44.824 --> 01:10:49.524
and their religion itself will get enlightened.

01:10:50.668 --> 01:10:55.868
They will see the beauty of their religion. They will see the oneness of all these religions,

01:10:55.868 --> 01:11:04.268
and like that a global religion can be accepted
where all religions will be understood properly.

01:11:04.411 --> 01:11:09.411
There have been deviations in every religion and that’s why there’s a problem.

01:11:09.411 --> 01:11:14.111
Can you fight in the name of religion when there is only one God?

01:11:14.254 --> 01:11:18.354
They do because they are ignorant. I don’t blame them.

01:11:18.354 --> 01:11:21.054
They have no light. But once they have the light,

01:11:21.197 --> 01:11:26.797
they will understand what is the global nature of religion.

01:11:27.154 --> 01:11:32.754
Now, you’ll be surprised that Sahaja Yoga - or we can call the Vishwa Nirmala Dharma -

01:11:32.754 --> 01:11:39.754
has been accepted in Russia as a religious identity.

01:11:49.692 --> 01:11:53.792
But it is not religion like other religions are.

01:11:54.497 --> 01:11:57.597
It is not at all of that kind.

01:11:57.797 --> 01:12:03.497
It’s a religion where only we believe in compassion,  love

01:12:03.811 --> 01:12:09.411
and also in our own power that nobody can touch you.

01:12:09.624 --> 01:12:12.324
Nobody can kill you.

01:12:12.324 --> 01:12:18.324
You will be amazed that there was such a big earthquake in Turkey

01:12:18.324 --> 01:12:22.524
but Sahaja Yogis, none of them were touched.

01:12:22.799 --> 01:12:28.799
Even their houses were completely all right when the rest was all destroyed.

01:12:34.396 --> 01:12:38.896
So many places, so many places it has happened.

01:12:39.196 --> 01:12:41.596
We had hurricane there - the same thing.

01:12:41.596 --> 01:12:44.496
All over, they are sending Me reports, “Mother,

01:12:44.496 --> 01:12:47.796
how all the Sahaja Yogis are saved.”

01:12:47.926 --> 01:12:50.826
How they are perfectly all right!

01:12:50.826 --> 01:12:53.926
Because youare protected by the Divine power!

01:12:53.926 --> 01:12:59.826
We have to believe in the Divine power, which all the religions have believed.

01:13:00.439 --> 01:13:07.039
Then the problem comes whether you should believe in the form or formless.

01:13:07.254 --> 01:13:13.054
Then you will realize that with the formless
only you can understand the form.

01:13:13.212 --> 01:13:19.212
Very simple thing it is to look at, but it is really extremely surprising.

01:13:20.292 --> 01:13:29.223
For example, once I said that Mecca is a Makeshwara Shiva written down in our books.

01:13:29.223 --> 01:13:31.496
But I didn’t know that I just said it.

01:13:31.496 --> 01:13:37.596
Now I read an article that they were all worshippers of Shiva.

01:13:39.039 --> 01:13:45.639
And this is something surprising that Mohammad Sahib never talked about any religion.

01:13:45.639 --> 01:13:51.139
Nobody has read even that, we can say, the Koran.
Nobody has read.

01:13:51.139 --> 01:13:55.339
We have a very good book written on Koran,  which of course I guided,

01:13:55.339 --> 01:14:00.139
and it’s so clearly saying what Mohammad Sahib has said.

01:14:00.139 --> 01:14:02.539
I mean also this brings discredit to people.

01:14:02.670 --> 01:14:06.170
Christ never said things which Christians are saying.

01:14:06.412 --> 01:14:08.012
Same with the Hindus.

01:14:08.197 --> 01:14:13.997
They are doing things which was never,  never written in any shastra.

01:14:14.412 --> 01:14:20.212
Very surprising that these people who are in charge of religion

01:14:20.452 --> 01:14:27.052
they are the ones who are spoiling the image of religions and creating this problem.

01:14:27.052 --> 01:14:31.352
I don’t know why they want to do it.
What is the use?

01:14:31.470 --> 01:14:39.970
Now, regarding, regarding Sakara [God in Form] and Nirakara [Formless]  it’s very simple to be understood.

01:14:40.411 --> 01:14:51.111
After getting Realization, you can feel the 'spanda" you can call it or vibratory awareness is there.

01:14:51.481 --> 01:14:57.381
With that you can feel what is truth what is not.

01:14:57.381 --> 01:15:05.881
Now I would say that there is no truth in worshipping a statue

01:15:05.881 --> 01:15:12.481
which is created by a drunkard or a person
who is using it for money.

01:15:12.611 --> 01:15:19.841
But even in the Bible it is said that whatever created by the sky

01:15:19.841 --> 01:15:24.241
or by the Mother Earth should not be disrespected.

01:15:24.853 --> 01:15:27.353
This is what we call as the swayambhu.

01:15:27.353 --> 01:15:36.453
But swayambhus for people who are not Realized souls, is just a sort of a ritual: a karmakand.

01:15:36.797 --> 01:15:43.097
It’s just a karmakand. They don’t understand  whether this, whatever is a swayambhu or not.

01:15:43.426 --> 01:15:48.726
Now, you being Sahaja Yogis, you have seen what I have told you that, “Go and see

01:15:48.726 --> 01:15:52.626
which are the Swyambhus”. And you have accepted it.

01:15:52.926 --> 01:15:58.045
I know in Tukarama’s place, you all were jumping and were enjoying it

01:15:58.045 --> 01:16:03.226
because you could feel the chaitanya, you could feel the vibrations.

01:16:03.639 --> 01:16:09.339
So first, you should know about Nirakara and then you can find out about Sakara.

01:16:09.554 --> 01:16:13.854
There is no quarrel about it. But if you are not a Realized soul,

01:16:13.854 --> 01:16:20.554
how can you say which place is swayambhu and which is not?

01:16:21.396 --> 01:16:23.496
So, the whole problem is solved.

01:16:23.496 --> 01:16:30.396
But first you, must have the knowledge,  the knowledge of vibrations.

01:16:30.868 --> 01:16:36.168
Now if you ask Me a very serious question that we are having in our country,

01:16:36.168 --> 01:16:41.768
which I would like to tell you about is about Shri Rama’s "mandira" [temple].

01:16:42.169 --> 01:16:46.969
Was Shri Rama was born there or not? He was!

01:16:53.883 --> 01:16:58.383
You can feel it onto your hands.  You can feel it. All of you can feel it.

01:16:58.383 --> 01:17:01.083
He was born there. No doubt!

01:17:01.211 --> 01:17:03.811
But for that, what is there to fight?

01:17:03.811 --> 01:17:07.911
Whether it’s a masjid or anything Shri Rama was born there.

01:17:07.911 --> 01:17:11.365
Vibrations are there, whatever it may be.

01:17:13.269 --> 01:17:18.369
But to glorify Him you must have a temple, doesn’t matter.

01:17:18.369 --> 01:17:22.169
Whether you have a masjid or a temple is the same!

01:17:22.626 --> 01:17:28.426
And if you want to have a temple you must do it
after Realization not before that.

01:17:32.341 --> 01:17:38.641
And also you should put there only Realized souls who will be in charge of the puja.

01:17:39.399 --> 01:17:45.699
Then only you will do real credit to that great soul of Shri Rama.

01:17:46.011 --> 01:17:51.111
All of them here, whether whatever their country from, they know Shri Rama.

01:17:51.481 --> 01:17:55.981
Not only that, but they know where He is within us

01:17:55.981 --> 01:17:58.181
and they know how to worship Him.

01:17:58.297 --> 01:18:00.397
They also know about Mohammad Sahib.

01:18:00.397 --> 01:18:03.797
They also know about Christ. They know the truth about Them

01:18:03.797 --> 01:18:06.697
within their own body, within themselves.

01:18:06.697 --> 01:18:11.297
Once that is the knowledge, the true knowledge,

01:18:11.954 --> 01:18:15.554
the absolute knowledge then what is the quarrel about?

01:18:15.883 --> 01:18:20.383
Everybody feels the same way. What will you quarrel for?

01:18:20.383 --> 01:18:25.083
If I say that my country, India, is a Yogabhumi; all right,

01:18:25.283 --> 01:18:30.683
you ask all of them whether they come from this country or that country,  all Sahaja Yogis they will say so.

01:18:30.911 --> 01:18:36.811
So, when they come from abroad, they bow to this country,

01:18:36.811 --> 01:18:42.911
while we Indians may not. They do, because they know this is a Yogabhumi

01:18:43.224 --> 01:18:50.624
and the Kundalini of the whole universe is inside this Yogabhumi.

01:18:51.083 --> 01:18:57.583
So, all these great things about our country

01:18:57.697 --> 01:19:03.797
are to be understood through the vibrations which Adi Shakaracharya called as "spanda".

01:19:03.969 --> 01:19:07.869
Actually, most of their poetry could not -

01:19:07.999 --> 01:19:13.699
because they were not prose - could not explain
to normal people what it was.

01:19:14.111 --> 01:19:19.411
But I think that if you go deep into these matters

01:19:19.411 --> 01:19:26.011
and understand the absolute knowledge
about all this through your "spanda",

01:19:26.011 --> 01:19:30.611
through your vibrations, you will know what is the truth.

01:19:30.611 --> 01:19:38.411
Because what’s the use of fighting for falsehood?
It’s like fighting the darkness.

01:19:38.654 --> 01:19:41.754
Why not have light and see for yourself?

01:19:41.754 --> 01:19:44.654
I, today, I have taken some liberty with you, Sir,

01:19:44.654 --> 01:19:49.754
because I wanted to tell you that in this country of ours

01:19:49.754 --> 01:19:53.554
we have the greatest knowledge about truth.

01:19:55.370 --> 01:20:03.070
Whole Sahaja Yoga is based, whatever I know,  is from - mostly from - our shastras.

01:20:04.254 --> 01:20:07.854
It’s not ritualism. It’s the deeper knowledge.

01:20:07.854 --> 01:20:11.454
All saints, whether you take Kabir, you take Nanaka,

01:20:11.454 --> 01:20:16.395
Mohammad Sahib, anyone – all of them have said, “Seek yourself within”.

01:20:16.395 --> 01:20:20.395
Why did they say so? Why did they say so?

01:20:20.395 --> 01:20:24.095
Because inside is the truth, the absolute truth,

01:20:24.224 --> 01:20:29.724
and with that absolute truth all these stupid, stupid things will drop out

01:20:29.941 --> 01:20:32.441
and you become a different personality.

01:20:32.569 --> 01:20:39.069
As it is, the time has come for  the whole world to change and transform.

01:20:39.339 --> 01:20:46.539
But you know, I now request you all to do lot of work for Me.

01:20:46.769 --> 01:20:54.369
I have done that was possible for Me to work it out and it has worked, no doubt.

01:20:54.568 --> 01:21:01.768
But you all can do it and change you - first of all, your own society,

01:21:01.768 --> 01:21:07.268
change your own countrymen, change also, then globally you can go.

01:21:07.268 --> 01:21:12.468
You can help, say for example, in India, some people can come and help here,

01:21:12.468 --> 01:21:15.755
and from India some could go and help there.

01:21:15.869 --> 01:21:19.169
So, now you are well equipped with that knowledge.

01:21:19.427 --> 01:21:21.427
So you should come and work it out.

01:21:21.427 --> 01:21:27.327
And, I must thank people from Australia who went now to Orissa.

01:21:27.539 --> 01:21:34.139
And they have formed nine centers - nine centers of Sahaja Yoga.

01:21:41.753 --> 01:21:45.453
This is happening and you know you can do it.

01:21:45.453 --> 01:21:51.153
You are quite capable of giving Realization to people.

01:21:51.153 --> 01:21:54.953
And, please now I request all of you

01:21:54.953 --> 01:22:02.053
to try this gift that you have, to be shared with others.
