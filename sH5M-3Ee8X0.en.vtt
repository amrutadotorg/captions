00:07.910 --> 00:08.160
Mahakali Puja
France

00:07.930 --> 00:08.180
July 11, 1993

00:07.950 --> 00:14.950
Today we have decided to have the Puja of
the Devi. This time we are not talking about

00:23.270 --> 00:30.270
Adi Shakti, about Kundalini or about Saraswati,
Mahalakshmi. We are talking about the Mahakali.

00:41.510 --> 00:48.510
That's the Goddess which is the first one,
which comes first and establishes Shri Ganesha

01:02.910 --> 01:09.910
in the form of Gauri. She’s the complete
form of Mahasaraswati and Mahalakshmi. Out

01:29.690 --> 01:36.640
of Her only these energies emit.

01:36.640 --> 01:43.640
So She’s the one who is the Power of desire
of God. Within us also She creates desires.

02:00.890 --> 02:07.890
These desires within us start emitting outside
and we develop a kind of a reaction to all

02:21.380 --> 02:28.380
our desires. The first and foremost desire,
as you know very much, the most primitive,

02:31.670 --> 02:38.670
is to feed yourself. And this is given to
us by the Goddess. She gives us the desire

02:50.410 --> 02:57.410
to feed ourselves. Now if we don't feed ourselves,
then we cannot survive, we have to have food.

02:59.510 --> 03:06.510
It is very important that we should feed ourselves
sufficiently enough to exist on this Earth.

03:10.730 --> 03:17.730
And also we have seen that when this kind
of desire grows very much more than normal,

03:25.910 --> 03:32.910
then you become slaves of this desire and
any amount of food cannot satisfy you. All

03:38.860 --> 03:45.310
the time you think of nothing else but food.

03:45.310 --> 03:52.310
I have told you many a times that the French
are very particular as to what they should

03:53.569 --> 03:59.930
eat. You see, they take at least forty-five
minutes on a dinner table to decide what they

03:59.930 --> 04:06.930
will eat. Ultimately, it's just the same.
I mean, I don't understand how can you need

04:07.620 --> 04:14.620
forty-five minutes to decide what you want
to eat. But this desire starts acting through

04:17.190 --> 04:24.190
your ego. So it satisfies you. And also those
people who are manufacturing food or who are

04:30.520 --> 04:37.520
supplying food in hotels and all that know
how to satisfy your desires. So they bring

04:40.370 --> 04:46.440
it in a way, show it round and then place
it before you, so that you approve of it and

04:46.440 --> 04:53.440
when you approve of it then they serve. They
know how to befool you and you feel quite

04:59.020 --> 05:02.600
happy, “Oh, it’s very good.” Even the
wine is given for testing first of all and,

05:02.600 --> 05:05.139
whether you like it or not, you have to say,
“It's very good,” and you better show

05:05.139 --> 05:08.650
that you like it.

05:08.650 --> 05:15.650
So this desire gets completely controlled
by your ego and when it becomes a kind of

05:23.500 --> 05:30.500
a collective desire and a collective ego expression,
then we become like gluttons, you see, I would

05:35.270 --> 05:42.270
say sophisticated. They are sophisticated,
but we are gluttons. Now with that, other

05:44.460 --> 05:51.460
things also people want to have, like proper
sort of a table lying and linen, this, that.

05:55.090 --> 06:02.090
Of course, if ego is not there, then people
would like to see, to please others by feeding

06:06.940 --> 06:13.940
them. This desire reacts. And then the new
desire comes in through the blessings of the

06:20.960 --> 06:27.960
Mahakali that you like to see others eating
the food. You enjoy when others eat the food

06:30.270 --> 06:37.270
cooked by you, served by you, given by you.
Just want to watch. That gives you satisfaction.

06:39.699 --> 06:46.699
But food, to any extent you may go, you will
never be satisfied. Today you’ll ask for

06:47.949 --> 06:50.530
this, tomorrow for that. This, that.

06:50.530 --> 06:55.430
Now, in the Western life today, it has become
very important to ask the child every day,

06:55.430 --> 07:01.520
“What will you have?” In olden days the
food was cooked for all the family, everybody

07:01.520 --> 07:07.080
would eat the same food. But now you must
ask the child, “What will you have?” Then

07:07.080 --> 07:11.250
the child has to say, “I'll have this.”
Now, supposing you don't have that in the

07:11.250 --> 07:18.250
fridge, you are finished. Early in the morning
there will be no shop open, nothing. How will

07:19.750 --> 07:25.430
you please that boy in his ego because he
wants a particular thing, so gradually we

07:25.430 --> 07:32.430
build up even the ego of our children. We
have to say, “This is cooked, this is nice

07:34.300 --> 07:41.110
and you eat this.” Is the duty of parents
not to allow children to grow their ego by

07:41.110 --> 07:48.110
what they want. You should know what they
have to have. Then it starts growing and growing

07:48.419 --> 07:55.419
and growing till they become quite grown up,
but very primitive.

07:56.860 --> 08:03.860
So, actually, the blessings of the Devi on
this point is that She gives you a desire

08:07.169 --> 08:14.169
that you should serve others. Also you then
get concerned about people who are starving,

08:15.669 --> 08:22.669
want to find out why they are starving. The
another extreme of this could be that some

08:22.900 --> 08:29.900
people think we should not eat so much, a
kind of a sacrificing nonsense. Whatever one

08:32.949 --> 08:39.769
has to eat, one should eat. Then they say,
“Why should we eat so much, Mother? After

08:39.769 --> 08:45.959
all, there are people who are starving.”
By your eating less or more, you cannot save

08:45.959 --> 08:52.959
those who are starving, can you? So there’s
no wisdom in this kind of austerity. And when

08:53.110 --> 09:00.110
the people enter into this kind of austerity,
then they have sufferings and troubles and

09:01.920 --> 09:08.379
such people become extremely, I should say,
ascetic and hot-tempered and you should never

09:08.379 --> 09:14.189
go near a person who is of that kind without
a barge pole. God knows when he’ll jump

09:14.189 --> 09:21.189
on you. So a person who is hungry is as bad
as a person who is overfed. I think hungry

09:25.939 --> 09:27.290
is worse.

09:27.290 --> 09:34.290
Now if you look at yourself, the second desire
that comes to you is that everyone should

09:37.839 --> 09:44.839
love you. This comes because that makes you
good person. You know that everybody likes

09:52.540 --> 09:59.540
goodness. So people try to be good to others,
nice to others, say a hundred times, “Thank

10:01.769 --> 10:08.769
you,” do all kinds of things to please others.
By pleasing others, they think others will

10:10.939 --> 10:17.939
like us very much. But then it develops again
out of bounds and then all the time you try

10:18.189 --> 10:25.189
to please others so that you become absolutely
slavish. You become so artificial that people

10:27.209 --> 10:34.209
can make out that it’s nothing natural is
this gentleman. He’s just trying to please

10:36.600 --> 10:37.360
us.

10:37.360 --> 10:44.360
Now, with that, the pleasing behind is some
sort of an advantage out of it. If you please

10:50.269 --> 10:56.670
another one with a detached mind, not expecting
anything that should be done for you or that

10:56.670 --> 11:02.449
could be achieved through that pleasing, is
very pure pleasing and is very good. That

11:02.449 --> 11:09.449
makes you really righteous and good. But supposing
you try to please others only just to take

11:09.519 --> 11:16.519
advantage of that person, then you develop
hypocrisy – hypocrisy of the worst type.

11:19.249 --> 11:26.249
And you get lost. People mock at you, laugh
at you. They are never pleased. They know

11:27.319 --> 11:34.319
that you are a hypocrite and you are doing
it for some sort of an advantage or an exploitation.

11:34.369 --> 11:40.529
You are not doing it because you want to be
good really, to be nice.

11:40.529 --> 11:47.529
A person who is good, automatically pleases
others. But he doesn’t try to please. He’s

11:48.079 --> 11:55.079
just – his nature is such, his temperament
is such that he just pleases people. This,

11:56.929 --> 12:03.929
when taken over again by Mister Ego, then
really you can't beat it. Such … then they

12:06.660 --> 12:13.660
become diplomats, you see, could be politicians,
all these doomed classes they become and they

12:14.279 --> 12:19.739
cannot get out of it. They get so much used
to it, that they cannot get out of it.

12:19.739 --> 12:26.739
Now what does the Devi do? She brings the
truth before them. She shows that what you

12:28.579 --> 12:31.519
have been doing for a particular exploitation
doesn’t work out. Up to a point it does.

12:31.519 --> 12:38.049
She exposes them. The exposure starts and
with that exposure, they are surprised, “How

12:38.049 --> 12:45.049
am I exposed? How am I caught, how people
know?” This is the job of the power of Mahakali.

12:53.049 --> 13:00.049
She exposes all that is wrong, all that is
falsehood, that is untruth, She exposes.

13:03.509 --> 13:10.509
Then the third desire people have is to possess
material things, from which materialism has

13:12.589 --> 13:19.589
come. But there’s no end to it. End can
never come because they have no satisfaction

13:21.839 --> 13:27.759
in getting one thing. Supposing today, “ I
want to have this carpet. All right, I'll

13:27.759 --> 13:32.730
get this one.” Then I want to have another
one. Then want to have another one. Then I

13:32.730 --> 13:36.489
want to have a car and then I want to have
a helicopter, then an aeroplane. I don't know

13:36.489 --> 13:37.989
what I want to have then.

13:37.989 --> 13:44.989
So it goes on and on and on and on until you
reach a time where people start thinking,

13:44.999 --> 13:51.910
“What's the matter with him?” And you
cannot enjoy anything that you get. This is

13:51.910 --> 13:57.869
also a human failing and this human failing
creates economics, you know that. Economics

13:57.869 --> 14:04.839
is created because wants, in general, are
not satiable. They are not satiable. So what

14:04.839 --> 14:11.839
happens, we go on from jumping from one to
another to another to another
and another. So then you become slaves of

14:20.249 --> 14:26.350
entrepreneurs, so much so, that you lose your
individuality completely.

14:26.350 --> 14:33.350
For example, an entrepreneur produces a funny
kind of a dress, one, one year. So everybody

14:34.739 --> 14:41.739
wants to wear the same, without thinking,
if it is necessary or not. Then he brings

14:43.299 --> 14:50.299
in another form. Next year everything is given
up, buy the another one. Third year another

14:51.160 --> 14:58.160
one. So, pile of all these clothes are there,
and nicely the manufacturer has become a great

15:00.129 --> 15:05.910
man of designs – he’s very good designs,
how to befool human beings. He has become

15:05.910 --> 15:12.910
a rich man and you have become poor with all
these kind of clothes which has no meaning

15:13.920 --> 15:15.639
for you anymore.

15:15.639 --> 15:22.639
About the same thing, about everything, something
is fashionable. That means you have no individuality.

15:24.879 --> 15:31.879
We talk of individuality, but we want to do
things which everybody is doing. I mean, you

15:33.220 --> 15:40.019
know that all kinds of absurd things people
have done in the name of fashion and specially

15:40.019 --> 15:44.379
people who are not traditionally bound, who
have had no traditions like Americans, I would

15:44.379 --> 15:51.379
say. They go on changing after every six months.
Every year you go, you find a new type of

15:53.519 --> 16:00.519
people there, new type of clothes. It's very
surprising how they change so fast without

16:02.009 --> 16:08.939
even thinking whether this will suit me or
not. Somebody says wear tight clothes, they’ll

16:08.939 --> 16:15.939
go with tight clothes. Then they develop varicose
veins, so they wear with the holes. Then they

16:16.290 --> 16:21.230
develop some other problem, then they wear
another kind. Nobody wants to think, “Why

16:21.230 --> 16:28.230
should I change my dress?” Like, say, in
India we wear saris, finished. Nothing doing.

16:30.899 --> 16:36.350
No problem with the tailor, nothing doing.
Whatever sari we like, we’ll buy. And a

16:36.350 --> 16:43.350
sari came called as mini sari in India, which
was up to here maybe, I don't know, not six

16:43.480 --> 16:50.319
inches, but at least up to the knee. It came
for about, I think, eight, seven days in Bombay

16:50.319 --> 16:56.540
and went back. People said, “Get lost. We
don't want it.”

16:56.540 --> 17:03.540
So this headache of all the time getting into
a fashion like herds without any sense in

17:12.520 --> 17:19.520
the head has to be understood properly. Why
people do it? Because they have no brains.

17:21.280 --> 17:28.280
They are brainless people. They’re not intelligent
to see that we are befooled every year. But,

17:29.830 --> 17:34.630
for Sahaja yogis, the Mahakali power works
and She teaches them that “All right, this

17:34.630 --> 17:41.630
dress suits you. Have this one.” And it's
the best for you. Once for all, your lifelong

17:45.930 --> 17:52.280
problem is solved. With this kind of blouse,
I started wearing from the very beginning

17:52.280 --> 17:59.280
perhaps and I've been wearing it and now I
find everybody wears the same style.

18:00.480 --> 18:05.490
Why to waste your energy in changing every
day this blouse starting from here to here,

18:05.490 --> 18:12.490
to here and going back again like this, you
see. Is such a waste of energy, such a waste

18:13.440 --> 18:19.190
of cloth. And we make ourselves so cheap running
with this race of reducing the sleeves, reducing

18:19.190 --> 18:26.190
this, reducing that – or increasing. Is
all a desire to impress people that we are

18:30.880 --> 18:37.880
very up-to-date. Who wants to know? Who wants
to find out that you are up-to-date or not?

18:44.320 --> 18:51.320
And we have no courage to keep to our own
dress that we have purchased. Why to waste

18:52.870 --> 18:59.870
so much money? We never even think, go on
changing, changing, changing for nothing at

19:00.460 --> 19:07.460
all. So this is desire is there to impress
others with our outside things. So many things

19:09.210 --> 19:16.210
like dress there are, which we try to impress.

19:18.570 --> 19:25.570
Now, hairstyle: I read an article. They said
that these hairstyles are responsible for

19:28.300 --> 19:35.300
many divorces. I was wondering, “How can
it be hairstyles be responsible for divorces?”

19:36.120 --> 19:43.120
Because they had made a survey: a man had
liked a hairstyle of his fiancée and then

19:45.650 --> 19:52.650
she changed her hairstyle, so he divorced
her. And the other way round. When it is so

20:04.440 --> 20:11.440
cheap way of disposing of such a deep relationship
of husband and wife.

20:14.190 --> 20:21.190
Now certain fads start. I also saw one documentary
about a lady who’d said that – it was

20:21.920 --> 20:28.920
in the one of the advertisements, something,
sort of a thing appeared that your legs should

20:29.210 --> 20:36.210
be of this shape and what you should do. So
poor thing spent so much time, energy, ran

20:36.280 --> 20:40.300
up and down to make the legs. I mean what
is the importance of these legs, except for

20:40.300 --> 20:46.630
walking? So, she went to make the shape like
that, you see. She used to measure it – would

20:46.630 --> 20:53.610
be always something missing here or there.
Then many people joined. They had a class

20:53.610 --> 21:00.610
for it. And a group joined to make legs like
that. And, ultimately, they found out that

21:01.290 --> 21:08.290
that leg was made out of wood. And they spent
so much money, so much energy to make legs

21:12.130 --> 21:19.130
like that. For what? What is the purpose?
If anybody says, “You run like this,”

21:21.590 --> 21:28.590
they start running. They say, “Jump like
this,” they start jumping. But why? Have

21:29.690 --> 21:36.690
we gone all nuts in our heads that we should
accept whatever one says, we start doing that.

21:38.150 --> 21:40.910
What is the purpose?

21:40.910 --> 21:47.880
So this kind of stupidity comes in our heads
when we start using our ego. With the ego

21:47.880 --> 21:54.880
a person becomes absolutely stupid. Because
he’ll say, “What's wrong? What's wrong

21:55.970 --> 22:02.970
if I have just a little hair here? What's
wrong?”

22:06.730 --> 22:13.730
“If I just try to wear a very short dress
here, what's wrong?”

22:20.570 --> 22:27.570
The wrong is, why are you wearing? Why don't
you ask a question? Why are you wearing? If

22:31.330 --> 22:36.630
you ask a question to yourself,” Why do
I have this kind of hairstyle? Why do I do

22:36.630 --> 22:43.630
like this?” It is really difficult to tell
people to do right things, but wrong things

22:47.990 --> 22:54.990
people take to like that. For example, I told
everyone that you put oil, if not every day,

22:56.420 --> 23:03.420
just before bath, lot of oil in your head
and wash. Now I find many people getting bald.

23:04.440 --> 23:11.440
But they didn't put the oil. What can I do
about it? But such a simple thing they won't

23:12.140 --> 23:19.140
have. Such a simple thing they would not believe,
that you need something for your nourishment.

23:20.760 --> 23:27.760
But they will do something which is absurd,
nonsensical without even thinking, “What

23:28.620 --> 23:28.870
is going to harm us?”

23:28.770 --> 23:35.770
Here the Mahakali, what does She do? She punishes
you. Your body is punished. If you wear very

23:43.460 --> 23:50.460
tight clothes, you develop problems of your
legs. If you wear holey pants, then you get

23:53.760 --> 24:00.760
cramps. Anything you do abnormal, you have
to pay for it. First you have to pay for doing

24:02.410 --> 24:09.410
it and then you have to pay for it physically.
So many things can be avoided if we just have

24:12.650 --> 24:19.650
a simple life, decide once for all that, “I
will have this kind of dress for this lifetime,”

24:22.640 --> 24:29.640
finished. Every day to change, itself, is
a headache. But that satisfies the ego, not

24:34.150 --> 24:35.790
your Self.

24:35.790 --> 24:42.790
So the Mahalakshmi Principle in us raises
higher and higher. Despite that, we are pulled

24:45.460 --> 24:52.460
down. Then this Mahakali, She comes forward
and shows what wrong we have done, how we

25:02.600 --> 25:09.600
have gone wrong, how we have missed the point.
Instead of think, “What is wrong?” She

25:44.840 --> 25:51.840
teaches you it is wrong.

26:00.760 --> 26:07.760
Then another thing She does, which is a very
beautiful thing She does, I think sometimes,

26:16.900 --> 26:23.810
that She creates a illusion to test your intelligence,
to test your sensibility, She creates an illusion,

26:23.810 --> 26:30.810
Bhranti rupena samstita. She makes a bhranti
in your head. Illusion. So you become illusive

26:40.560 --> 26:47.560
or others become illusive or a situation becomes
illusive. And you are lost in it. Then you

26:49.820 --> 26:56.820
really did understand that “It's wrong thing
I have done.”

26:58.080 --> 27:05.080
It's a very nice story about Narada. Narada
was under an impression about himself and

27:09.870 --> 27:16.870
ultimately he became ego-oriented and he started
saying, “Oh, look at me. I’m never enticed

27:22.110 --> 27:29.110
by any woman. Even Shiva was enticed by Cupid.
I am never enticed. I am the highest, of highest,

27:34.740 --> 27:41.740
brahmachari.” So Vishnu sent two gandharvas
to entice him. So they met him in a forest

27:48.690 --> 27:55.690
and told him, “Oh, Narada, you are such
a handsome man, such a beautiful man and all

28:01.320 --> 28:08.320
your beauty’s wasted. You must test your
beauty. You must see how beautiful you are.

28:13.740 --> 28:16.070
You are so handsome.”

28:16.070 --> 28:17.520
He said, “Really?”

28:17.520 --> 28:22.370
“Yes,” she said. “There’s a very simple
way of testing.”

28:22.370 --> 28:23.340
“Is how?”

28:23.340 --> 28:30.340
She said, “There’s a wedding coming up
of a very beautiful woman. She is the princess

28:33.620 --> 28:40.620
of the beauty … city, is called Rupadaka
– and you should go there and see how she

28:44.000 --> 28:47.050
will appreciate you.”

28:47.050 --> 28:54.050
So he, in his ego, became so stupid that he
went there. And he was sitting and lots of

28:59.030 --> 29:06.030
people were coming, big, big maharajas, rajas,
all of them were sitting and he was thinking,

29:09.380 --> 29:16.380
“Oh, I’m the best among all of them. Who
are these? The princess will just garland

29:19.980 --> 29:26.980
me, no doubt about it.”

29:27.400 --> 29:34.400
And these two were, you see, putting that
illusion into his head, bhranti. With the

29:41.980 --> 29:48.980
Agnya, you get bhranti. This princess came
round. She looked at him and she laughed aloud.

29:53.940 --> 30:00.940
She couldn't control herself and she moved
on giggling. Couldn't understand why she laughed

30:04.410 --> 30:11.410
at him. She didn’t garland him or nothing
but she just laughed. So couldn’t understand,

30:15.620 --> 30:20.850
“I’m such a handsome man,” this thing.

30:20.850 --> 30:27.850
So these two gandharvas told him, “Oh, doesn’t
matter. You see, she doesn’t understand.

30:29.320 --> 30:35.580
She'll come back,” this, that. Then they
went out and near a lake and he sat down to

30:35.580 --> 30:42.580
wash his face and looked at in the water his
reflection. He, looked like a monkey. He looked

30:47.420 --> 30:51.830
at these two and he cursed them.

30:51.830 --> 30:56.230
He said, “I look like a monkey.”

30:56.230 --> 31:02.540
Said, “To us, you look like very handsome.”

31:02.540 --> 31:09.540
“But I really look like a monkey.”

31:12.920 --> 31:19.630
So this bhranti, this illusion was created
in his mind by his ego. But this power, itself,

31:19.630 --> 31:25.100
Mahakali’s power, She puts this ego right
by creating illusion, bhranti. And this is

31:25.100 --> 31:32.100
responsible for many illusions we run after.
It’s a mirage, running after it, running

31:33.020 --> 31:40.020
after it. Once we are satisfied within ourselves,
then we don't run after mirages. This illusion,

31:41.760 --> 31:48.760
if it is not created, people would be so egoistical
that whole world will be finished.

31:51.559 --> 31:53.620
So this is the great work of Mahakali Power
within us, that She creates illusions. Many

31:53.620 --> 31:53.870
people talk of maya. “This is, Mother, maya.
This is maya. That is maya.” Is the work

31:53.620 --> 31:53.870
of Mahakali. She wants to test you. She wants
to test you. But in Sahaja Yoga it's not such

31:53.620 --> 31:53.870
a strong one.

31:53.690 --> 31:54.429
For example, you know Abraham had a son. One
son He had after a long time. And God asked

31:54.429 --> 31:56.270
Him that He should sacrifice his son. His
wife said, “ I also was feeling terrible

31:56.270 --> 31:56.530
that He has to sacrifice His son.” So He
went down to the place where the child was

31:56.530 --> 31:56.790
to be sacrificed. He made a fire, everything
and He was about to put the child on that

31:56.790 --> 31:57.150
pyre of fire when the voice came, “This
is Mahakali, that you don’t have to sacrifice

31:57.150 --> 31:57.400
your child.”

31:57.330 --> 32:01.160
We have many such stories in Indian mythology
also where they were tested. So to test Sahaja

32:01.160 --> 32:04.450
yogis also, this Mahakali helps you. There
was a gentleman who was very egoistical, so

32:04.450 --> 32:06.740
I told him to come to Delhi because I didn’t
know how to do it here. Came to Delhi and

32:06.740 --> 32:09.650
he told everybody, “See, Mother told me
to come here just to cure Her.”

32:09.650 --> 32:09.960
I said, “All right. Come along.”

32:09.960 --> 32:10.210
He came.

32:09.970 --> 32:10.220
I said, “What’s wrong with Me?”

32:09.980 --> 32:10.679
He said, “Mother, Your Nabhi is very bad.”

32:10.679 --> 32:13.470
I said, “Really? You put a bandhan to yourself
and now see for yourself.”

32:13.470 --> 32:13.720
“Oh my God, what’s happening to me here?”

32:13.550 --> 32:13.800
I said, “That’s My Nabhi.”

32:13.600 --> 32:14.130
So this is how the illusion corrects you.
If there is no illusion, you would not ever

32:14.130 --> 32:16.140
be corrected directly. Supposing I say, “Don't
do this.” You may not like. Of course, mostly

32:16.140 --> 32:16.929
you like, but sometimes you don't. And then
the illusion works and then you realize, “Where

32:16.929 --> 32:19.160
was I and where am I now? I should not have
done this. How is it I have landed into this

32:19.160 --> 32:26.160
problem? What has made me so stupid?” So
this is something which She does.

32:29.820 --> 32:36.820
Another is She's the one who relaxes you completely.
When you are tired and fed up, when you don't

32:39.870 --> 32:46.870
know what to do, then She makes you sleep.
She’s the one who gives you sleep. All day's

32:51.200 --> 32:58.200
work you do, ultimately the Mahakali power
acts on you as sleep. She makes you sleep,

33:00.210 --> 33:07.210
sleep like a child. You know, at that time,
all that wrong we have done to ourselves and

33:08.179 --> 33:15.179
to others are forgiven. In Her lap we sleep
nicely, quietly and all our problems are solved.

33:21.190 --> 33:28.190
In those dreams, when you are, She brings
forth solutions to you. I know so many people

33:31.100 --> 33:36.450
told Me, “Mother, you came in my dream and
told me that this is the medicine you should

33:36.450 --> 33:43.450
take.” “You came in my dream and You told
me that this particular type of life will

33:44.200 --> 33:51.200
suit you.” They see Me clearly coming, but
there it is not whole of Me, but I think the

33:51.250 --> 33:55.740
Mahakali Power acts. Into very deep sleep
you are, it is called, as the sushupti. There

33:55.740 --> 33:57.150
She appears.

33:57.150 --> 34:04.150
One lady came to Me and she said, “Mother,
You came in my dream and you said that “I’m

34:07.460 --> 34:10.599
here in Bombay.” Nobody told me.

34:10.599 --> 34:17.599
So, so many things happen like this. In the
dream She guides you and tells you. Now what

34:20.589 --> 34:27.589
happens sometimes, people tell Me that I had
such and such dream, which is all falsehood,

34:28.429 --> 34:33.759
I know. They never dreamt like that. They
never saw like this. But, just to impress

34:33.759 --> 34:40.759
Me, they tell Me that “Oh, I had a dream,”
this, that. I just show complete ignorance,

34:42.559 --> 34:48.690
“Ya, must be.” Then they are put into
again bhranti, means illusion. Gradually,

34:48.690 --> 34:55.690
they realize that it was wrong to tell lies
to Mother. So the correction part takes place.

35:00.039 --> 35:07.039
But the greatest thing that She does is to
give you the sense of chastity and security.

35:14.170 --> 35:21.170
When the children are born, they have sense
of chastity, shame, decency, decorous behavior.

35:22.809 --> 35:29.809
But gradually, when they start others misbehaving,
they start misbehaving. To them, decency becomes

35:31.349 --> 35:38.349
a bondage. But, naturally, She's there to
tell you that “This is indecent. You shouldn't

35:39.309 --> 35:46.309
do it. This is wrong. This is not the proper
thing to do." But gradually, you grow up and

35:49.579 --> 35:56.579
mature, then you go, “What’s wrong?”
You start disrespecting your chastity and

36:03.170 --> 36:09.460
you start becoming like immature, stupid people.

36:09.460 --> 36:16.460
All this, if is understood through meditation,
the Mahakali helps you a lot. In meditation,

36:21.599 --> 36:28.599
She helps you a lot because She's the one
who creates the proper passage for kundalini

36:31.049 --> 36:38.049
to rise. Mahakali is the same as the kundalini
because She is the residual energy of Mahakali

36:39.190 --> 36:46.190
Power, full of it there. But the function
is different. The function of Mahakali is

36:48.980 --> 36:55.980
to protect you, is to guide you, to give you
wisdom. And the function of the kundalini

36:58.359 --> 37:05.359
is to cleanse you, to clear it out, not to
play about with you, to forgive you and help

37:08.680 --> 37:10.180
you to grow properly.

37:10.180 --> 37:17.180
Now in your life, as Sahaja yogis, you will
see how Mahakali helps you in every way. It

37:18.160 --> 37:25.160
is so interesting to watch Her work, how She
brings forth all kinds of satisfactions to

37:27.759 --> 37:34.759
you. The greed goes away. The temptations
go away. The temper goes away. All these things

37:34.970 --> 37:41.970
disappear. The most helpful thing She does,
that you get rid of your bad habits. Absolutely.

37:44.980 --> 37:51.980
Automatically, in the light of Mahakali's
power, you just do not want anything destructive

37:53.480 --> 38:00.480
to be practiced. If you have been practicing
anything destructive, you try to get rid of

38:05.230 --> 38:09.400
it. Just you stop it. “I don’t want to
have it.” I never tell you, “Don’t do

38:09.400 --> 38:11.079
this. Don’t do that.”

38:11.079 --> 38:17.539
It's the Mahakali power within you which is
awakened, does all these things. And She has

38:17.539 --> 38:24.140
made you so beautiful, so angelic. She has,
by Her corrections and by Her illusions, She

38:24.140 --> 38:31.140
has made you like this so you don't get so
much attached to money, to greed, to lust,

38:42.049 --> 38:47.809
all these things which are responsible for
putting you down; also possessiveness for

38:47.809 --> 38:52.329
children, possessiveness for husband, possessiveness
of matter. You just start understanding that

38:52.329 --> 38:59.329
the joy is in sharing. You want to share everything
with others and that sharing starts when this

39:01.499 --> 39:08.499
Mahakali Powers start giving you blessings
of joy, of sharing, of being collective, of

39:17.019 --> 39:24.019
being pure. These blessings come to you from
the Mahakali Power.

39:26.039 --> 39:29.420
So today we are going to worship that Mahakali
Power.

39:29.420 --> 39:30.609
May God bless you!
