1
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:12,570
Today it's a different day altogether for all of you,

2
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:22,370
because this is the Puja of Adi Shakti.

3
00:00:23,847 --> 00:00:31,079
And Adi Shakti is a complete personality,

4
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:38,413
it's not only the left side that you know.

5
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:46,079
You all know only the left side, from Shri Ganesha

6
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:55,413
through the ascent of different, different chakras on the left side.

7
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,179
I didn't want to tell you about the right side to begin with,

8
00:01:03,113 --> 00:01:11,113
because those who have gone through the right side got just lost.

9
00:01:14,213 --> 00:01:23,246
They got Gayatri Mantra from the writings

10
00:01:25,113 --> 00:01:28,046
but they didn't know what it was about,

11
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:35,179
they just used to learn it by heart.

12
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:40,113
They didn't also know the real meaning of it,

13
00:01:41,113 --> 00:01:47,113
and that is how they moved on the right side

14
00:01:48,346 --> 00:01:53,413
and, I don’t know, they landed up at the Agnya;

15
00:01:56,246 --> 00:02:00,613
and then they were trying for the Self-realization.

16
00:02:01,213 --> 00:02:07,113
They were promised that if you do this right side properly,

17
00:02:08,213 --> 00:02:14,280
you will reach to the ultimate goal of Self-realization.

18
00:02:15,413 --> 00:02:18,079
But none of them reached there.

19
00:02:18,613 --> 00:02:22,113
Most of them got into a terrible temper,

20
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:29,113
terrible temper of cursing others, of destroying others.

21
00:02:29,446 --> 00:02:37,280
All these things they learnt through their right-side movement.

22
00:02:39,313 --> 00:02:42,113
There was no kundalini awakening,

23
00:02:43,113 --> 00:02:51,113
and they were made to go up to the, at the most, Agnya Chakra,

24
00:02:52,113 --> 00:02:59,213
and then they collapsed into different places of complete ignorance.

25
00:03:02,647 --> 00:03:10,813
All these books were written without understanding

26
00:03:11,346 --> 00:03:15,546
that it's not easy to go via right side,

27
00:03:17,346 --> 00:03:23,580
but best was to awaken your kundalini.

28
00:03:24,546 --> 00:03:30,079
The kundalini directly takes you up in the center of all the chakras,

29
00:03:30,647 --> 00:03:37,113
up to the Agnya and crosses Agnya, and goes beyond Agnya

30
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:44,113
into the Sahasrara, and then it pierces through the Sahasrara.

31
00:03:44,713 --> 00:03:51,213
Now, what is so important about the Brahmarandra, from where it pierces?

32
00:03:52,146 --> 00:03:54,346
I never told you about it.

33
00:03:55,113 --> 00:03:59,346
But now I think for most of you the time has come.

34
00:04:00,647 --> 00:04:06,213
You see in the childhood the child has a talu,

35
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:11,613
is the fontanel bone area which is pulsating always.

36
00:04:12,246 --> 00:04:19,179
It is pulsating because the spirit entered through that area,

37
00:04:20,446 --> 00:04:26,313
and when you close it, it settles in the heart.

38
00:04:28,213 --> 00:04:34,113
Now you have to become the spirit-oriented person,

39
00:04:34,513 --> 00:04:41,313
but how to enter into the Sahasrara was the problem.

40
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,546
The tantrikas who were there, they went through the right, left side,

41
00:04:47,146 --> 00:04:57,380
and they developed all the practices of black – we should say, the left side.

42
00:04:59,179 --> 00:05:06,613
So the right-sided became extremely hot-tempered, I should say,

43
00:05:06,713 --> 00:05:12,346
extremely ambitious, ferocious,

44
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:22,513
and they started killing people on the basis of cursing.

45
00:05:23,146 --> 00:05:25,446
They are very good at cursing people;

46
00:05:26,546 --> 00:05:31,546
to be always forward, push back all the people,

47
00:05:32,179 --> 00:05:36,179
and override everybody's rights.

48
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:43,246
They were regarded as the most ambitious and most powerful people.

49
00:05:44,113 --> 00:05:50,346
Now the brahmins and to some extent the kshatriyas,

50
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,213
they then took the right side.

51
00:05:54,113 --> 00:05:58,179
Because of the right side they became very powerful, no doubt.

52
00:05:59,113 --> 00:06:02,146
They got all the powers over the world

53
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:12,380
and they were regarded as extremely powerful and majestic people,

54
00:06:12,546 --> 00:06:16,647
but they were not, because they were so hot-tempered.

55
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,680
Hot-tempered people cannot be spiritual.

56
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:26,079
So they were told, “You'll get your spirituality, don't worry, keep moving,”

57
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:33,480
and the seven chakras were described, on the right side.

58
00:06:35,179 --> 00:06:41,313
According to them there is bhuh, bhurvah.

59
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,280
Bhuh is this prithivi, is this world, bhuh.

60
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,613
Bhurvah is the complete cosmos, or we can call it antariksha.

61
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:59,079
Swaha: swaha is consumption at the Nabhi Chakra;

62
00:06:59,546 --> 00:07:05,313
and swadha is the, swadha is the consumption inside,

63
00:07:05,346 --> 00:07:12,213
is to absorption – swaha, swadha.

64
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:21,046
Then is the mind, heart – manah.

65
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:35,079
After manah came the Agnya – the Vishuddhi.

66
00:07:35,546 --> 00:07:41,413
The Vishuddhi is janah, collectivity, people,

67
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:46,246
go to the people – janah.

68
00:07:47,546 --> 00:07:52,346
Then at the Agnya it is tapah.

69
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:59,146
In tapah we have Christ in the center;

70
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:10,079
left side they had Jainism, right side Christianity.

71
00:08:12,413 --> 00:08:16,246
They were not actually ascending path,

72
00:08:17,113 --> 00:08:22,580
they were just side outlets, we can say,

73
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:29,747
for the energy of people who were trying to seek the truth.

74
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:39,213
Now this happened for ages in India.

75
00:08:39,647 --> 00:08:42,246
All the gurus, all the sadhus,

76
00:08:43,313 --> 00:08:46,280
all the big tapassvis, all of them did this.

77
00:08:46,713 --> 00:08:49,113
But where did they reach?

78
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,747
Tapassvis were the people who could give curses –

79
00:08:55,113 --> 00:09:00,146
kshu, shapah – to people, they could curse somebody.

80
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:09,346
With the kataksha, is with the glance of the eye they could kill somebody,

81
00:09:10,113 --> 00:09:15,213
they could burn something; all right-sided powers they had.

82
00:09:15,713 --> 00:09:20,713
And with these right-sided powers, where did they reach?

83
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:27,480
To hell, I should say, in a way – if not, in the limbo, as you call it.

84
00:09:29,113 --> 00:09:32,280
There nobody got Self-realization.

85
00:09:33,513 --> 00:09:43,113
You read the old books from India, but even otherwise the Greeks;

86
00:09:45,213 --> 00:09:51,580
and then we had Egyptians, English

87
00:09:52,546 --> 00:09:59,213
and all kinds of aggressive people, Germans

88
00:09:59,513 --> 00:10:09,847
– all of them were aggressive – Catholics, and also you had Romans.

89
00:10:10,613 --> 00:10:12,647
All of them were aggressive,

90
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:18,747
and were taking the land and property of other countries;

91
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:25,346
extremely aggressive, they believed in the killing of the people -

92
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,680
extremely, insulting, hot-tempered people.

93
00:10:33,713 --> 00:10:42,246
So how to bring them to the normal, to the central path?

94
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:54,113
One side was, as I told you, bhuh, bhurv, swaha, swadha,

95
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:59,213
it’s consumption – this was done by Guru Principle.

96
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:07,113
Then we have manah, janah – that is collective.

97
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,446
They became collective, no doubt, because they were so powerful

98
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:21,413
that they had such a lot of people with them to fight for the oppressive.

99
00:11:21,813 --> 00:11:25,413
With their oppressive temperament they were fighting on people

100
00:11:25,413 --> 00:11:27,346
and were oppressing them.

101
00:11:29,113 --> 00:11:34,113
All this kind of … generation came in the history,

102
00:11:34,113 --> 00:11:37,246
as you know, and then it disappeared.

103
00:11:39,446 --> 00:11:47,280
Wars were created, then so many people were killed.

104
00:11:48,446 --> 00:11:54,113
We had Hitler as the maximum of cruelty.

105
00:11:55,113 --> 00:11:59,113
They never cared for humanity.

106
00:12:00,146 --> 00:12:03,747
Then ultimately it came to the Agnya.

107
00:12:04,413 --> 00:12:14,246
Agnya also they killed Jesus Christ, they destroyed Jesus Christ.

108
00:12:15,313 --> 00:12:19,113
They destroyed so many great saints who were really saints

109
00:12:19,213 --> 00:12:25,146
through the central path – some were incarnations –

110
00:12:25,446 --> 00:12:27,413
and they destroyed them.

111
00:12:28,847 --> 00:12:37,480
All this happened since the time of Rama, all that has happened.

112
00:12:39,213 --> 00:12:43,647
And one after another so many rakshasas came,

113
00:12:44,446 --> 00:12:50,113
and they destroyed the peaceful culture of the world;

114
00:12:51,546 --> 00:12:57,413
extremely arrogant show-offs, as we can call them,

115
00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:00,546
very aggressive people.

116
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:10,446
And this aggression came, came with such a great force,

117
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,113
and followed one after another.

118
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:20,179
It went up to a point.

119
00:13:20,513 --> 00:13:28,280
When people reacted, they were killed and were destroyed.

120
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:38,246
So horrible people were created;

121
00:13:45,213 --> 00:14:00,113
all these people, as they were aggressive and destructive.

122
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:11,413
This nature is still within us, some people, because they are right-sided.

123
00:14:12,546 --> 00:14:23,313
All right-side people had this problem: temper, aggression, controlling others.

124
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:30,246
The growth stopped, and there was no spiritual growth.

125
00:14:31,647 --> 00:14:34,713
They wanted to have spirituality,

126
00:14:35,346 --> 00:14:45,647
but with this kind of behavior they had developed, spirituality ran away.

127
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,146
We had so many incarnations.

128
00:14:50,613 --> 00:14:55,446
They all were killed, crucified, or were finished.

129
00:14:57,413 --> 00:15:06,380
There was no possibility of saving human beings in general.

130
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,747
One bad man came and he ruined the whole world.

131
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,046
We had one Hitler who really hit all the people,

132
00:15:17,113 --> 00:15:21,780
all the countries, all the nations, and we were all finished.

133
00:15:23,246 --> 00:15:30,613
All this is because we have taken to right-sided movement

134
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:35,380
which they thought was easier for spirituality, which was not.

135
00:15:36,513 --> 00:15:42,079
So they crossed all the limits, and they reached a stage

136
00:15:42,613 --> 00:15:49,613
that they became absolutely devils, rakshasas,

137
00:15:50,113 --> 00:15:54,680
without realizing that human beings are rakshasas,

138
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,280
that's what they become.

139
00:16:01,713 --> 00:16:04,613
Even their gurus were like that,

140
00:16:05,346 --> 00:16:13,280
and nothing but they tortured even the incarnations,

141
00:16:13,613 --> 00:16:16,647
all the incarnations were tortured by them.

142
00:16:17,613 --> 00:16:22,113
It was really – how they saved themselves is remarkable,

143
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:28,079
but ultimately they couldn't produce any results.

144
00:16:29,513 --> 00:16:36,613
So the first thing I tried was to study about the kundalini,

145
00:16:38,446 --> 00:16:41,546
that I should be able to raise the kundalini.

146
00:16:41,813 --> 00:16:44,213
And I knew I had come for that,

147
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,313
not for anything else, but only to raise the kundalini of people

148
00:16:49,546 --> 00:16:56,613
so that they take to the central path, not to the right or to the left.

149
00:16:57,413 --> 00:17:03,513
But I told you the knowledge of the left side, plus raising your kundalini.

150
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:09,480
By raising your kundalini you broke your Sahasrara,

151
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:22,280
and you entered into the realm of real joy, of reality.

152
00:17:23,847 --> 00:17:29,446
All these bad qualities started falling out.

153
00:17:31,113 --> 00:17:34,246
In the central path first the Mooladhara came.

154
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,380
By the awakening of the Mooladhara and the central path,

155
00:17:40,213 --> 00:17:45,113
you became very pure people.

156
00:17:45,747 --> 00:17:50,513
Your eyes became pure, your licentiousness went away,

157
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:56,046
your cheapness went away and you became very, very –

158
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,613
I think we should call them the holy people.

159
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:09,079
Unless and until that happens you cannot be in Sahaja Yoga.

160
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,513
You cannot be a licentious, you cannot be a flirtish,

161
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:20,546
you cannot be a man who wants to grab money from others and all that,

162
00:18:21,046 --> 00:18:25,380
or anyone who is very aggressive could be in Sahaja Yoga.

163
00:18:26,213 --> 00:18:28,346
So all such people were thrown out.

164
00:18:28,613 --> 00:18:32,179
Once they were thrown out they were showing their teeth, I should say.

165
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:35,179
They didn't like it that they were thrown out.

166
00:18:35,413 --> 00:18:41,079
But they understand now, some of them, that “we have made mistakes.”

167
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:48,480
So first thing is that you must develop your sense of chastity,

168
00:18:49,446 --> 00:18:53,079
respect it and enjoy it.

169
00:18:53,546 --> 00:18:58,546
That happened because of your Mooladhara being awakened.

170
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:07,313
That's the first chakra on the left side, where you have Shri Ganesha.

171
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,280
But on the right side also we have deities.

172
00:19:12,413 --> 00:19:18,280
On every chakra we have deities to compensate,

173
00:19:19,046 --> 00:19:22,580
but Shri Ganesha is in the center.

174
00:19:23,613 --> 00:19:30,313
And that's how we were blessed by His powerful purity,

175
00:19:31,113 --> 00:19:35,146
and we started understanding the beauty of purity,

176
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,280
the power of purity.

177
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:46,446
That's how our right side we finished off.

178
00:19:47,113 --> 00:19:53,413
Right side was for fighting, for killing, anger.

179
00:19:55,613 --> 00:19:58,580
There was no peace for these people.

180
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:06,079
The only thing they knew how to dominate others, and to be intolerable.

181
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:16,079
So then they rose to a higher, to higher level of Swadisthan.

182
00:20:17,146 --> 00:20:21,213
In Swadisthana they rose,

183
00:20:21,647 --> 00:20:28,246
and the aggressiveness of the creative people to create something.

184
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,346
Even now we have many.

185
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:36,647
They create all kinds of nonsense, create all sorts of grotesque,

186
00:20:37,113 --> 00:20:46,546
also very, very, I should say, dirty things to make a name.

187
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:51,146
So this is the another thing we got it in Swadisthana,

188
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,179
people who wanted to have a name, a position –

189
00:20:57,413 --> 00:21:00,413
that came from right Swadisthana.

190
00:21:01,346 --> 00:21:07,647
Then the third chakra that was there was the Nabhi Chakra.

191
00:21:08,413 --> 00:21:12,446
On the Nabhi Chakra they went all out to make money,

192
00:21:12,513 --> 00:21:18,346
not Lakshmi but money, money by any means,

193
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:23,346
and they cheated the whole world.

194
00:21:23,647 --> 00:21:31,046
With this money that they got, they did all kinds of bad things.

195
00:21:33,647 --> 00:21:39,446
Either they cheated or they were aggressive.

196
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:47,113
Cheating was very much in the left-side countries like India,

197
00:21:48,413 --> 00:21:52,613
and aggressiveness in the right-side countries.

198
00:21:55,213 --> 00:22:02,246
In the center, what quality we have at the Swadisthana is the creativeness:

199
00:22:02,747 --> 00:22:06,513
creative of art, which is very beautiful,

200
00:22:06,613 --> 00:22:11,546
which is very deep, which is absolutely spiritual.

201
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,280
That vanished, and people started showing

202
00:22:16,313 --> 00:22:20,413
even the incarnations full of dirty habits.

203
00:22:21,513 --> 00:22:25,613
All kinds of filth came in with that progress.

204
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:30,780
Then, as I told you, there's Nabhi.

205
00:22:31,413 --> 00:22:39,113
In Nabhi people got after money.

206
00:22:40,747 --> 00:22:43,113
Left-sided people were making money,

207
00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:45,647
right-sided were aggressive with their money.

208
00:22:45,713 --> 00:22:49,380
If they were earning they thought they’re on top of the world.

209
00:22:50,213 --> 00:22:54,280
If they had money they thought, “Nobody is better than us.”

210
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:00,780
All this finished them off, it's finishing.

211
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,546
It will come to that point where they will realize

212
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:10,280
that money is not for destroying but for construction:

213
00:23:10,813 --> 00:23:15,179
constructing of the country, constructing of the human beings together

214
00:23:15,346 --> 00:23:18,213
to bring peace and love among them,

215
00:23:19,313 --> 00:23:25,513
for helping, for doing all kinds of good things.

216
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:38,380
Then the same right-sided people went to the chakra of the Mother,

217
00:23:40,213 --> 00:23:45,246
and they were horrible mothers, tried to dominate their children,

218
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:52,480
dominate everyone, and could not sacrifice anything for the children.

219
00:23:53,246 --> 00:23:56,380
We have had enough of these women

220
00:23:56,713 --> 00:24:01,280
who are aggressive with their husbands, are aggressive with their children.

221
00:24:02,113 --> 00:24:06,446
And even the motherhood among men is dead and finished.

222
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:13,113
All that kind of lot when I came on this Earth I saw,

223
00:24:13,346 --> 00:24:17,446
and I was shocked – what sort of human beings are those?

224
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:20,146
What am I going to do with them?

225
00:24:20,513 --> 00:24:23,179
How will I awaken their kundalini?

226
00:24:24,113 --> 00:24:27,179
At the Nabhi Chakra only they were lost,

227
00:24:28,213 --> 00:24:31,079
but now it is the Mother's chakra.

228
00:24:31,413 --> 00:24:36,713
They had no fatherhood, no motherhood, they drove out their children –

229
00:24:37,413 --> 00:24:42,446
very selfish, self-centered, dominating parents.

230
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:51,480
This was the Heart Chakra.

231
00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:57,380
Then came the collective chakra, what we call as the Vishuddhi.

232
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:03,246
At the Vishuddhi Chakra they wanted to occupy the whole world.

233
00:25:04,313 --> 00:25:13,446
They wanted to occupy the whole world as their own to become emperors,

234
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:18,546
and they formed empires and misbehaved to such an extent

235
00:25:19,113 --> 00:25:22,113
that it's not humanly possible to behave like that.

236
00:25:22,246 --> 00:25:24,413
They really were rakshasas, I should say,

237
00:25:24,613 --> 00:25:27,480
and those rakshas qualities are still there.

238
00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:32,313
In their behavior, in everything you can see how they behave

239
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,146
towards people, treating them like that,

240
00:25:37,613 --> 00:25:44,446
creating people who are against spirituality,

241
00:25:45,113 --> 00:25:48,113
and those who are aggressive.

242
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,680
Well, these became like a two-sided world

243
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:58,346
where there are people who are aggressive,

244
00:25:59,113 --> 00:26:01,313
and the people who are tortured.

245
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:11,213
This two-sided world exists even now, but is much less.

246
00:26:12,513 --> 00:26:16,313
Thanks to the collective understanding

247
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:21,179
there are many good institution that were established

248
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:26,113
but they are not working out, they are not so successful,

249
00:26:26,546 --> 00:26:32,346
because the men at the head of it are controlling, but controlling what?

250
00:26:32,613 --> 00:26:35,613
Not themselves – controlling others,

251
00:26:36,113 --> 00:26:41,313
and all their behavior has spoilt all the work of this chakra.

252
00:26:43,113 --> 00:26:47,113
Collectively you have, if you see around now today

253
00:26:47,313 --> 00:26:54,246
everywhere there’s war going on, fights going on, killing going on,

254
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:59,613
destruction going on. How is it?

255
00:27:00,346 --> 00:27:05,213
There are so many spiritual people here now on this world.

256
00:27:05,546 --> 00:27:10,046
So the reason is, the spiritual people have become very quiet,

257
00:27:10,413 --> 00:27:13,480
very much enjoying their spiritual life,

258
00:27:14,213 --> 00:27:20,113
have become very quiet and very peaceful people.

259
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,480
But that doesn't bring peace.

260
00:27:24,313 --> 00:27:29,179
You have to be dynamic and you have to bring peace in the world,

261
00:27:29,313 --> 00:27:31,246
you have to do something about it.

262
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,313
We are very much satisfied with our progress,

263
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:39,580
but we are not bothered as to see what is the progress others have done,

264
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,346
how far they have gone, where can we meet them,

265
00:27:43,513 --> 00:27:45,280
what can we change them.

266
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,847
At My level I can change many things,

267
00:27:48,213 --> 00:27:51,313
but at your level how many people have you changed?

268
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,079
What have you done? That has to be said.

269
00:27:55,179 --> 00:27:59,313
Still you live with your ego, on the Agnya,

270
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,246
and you are very happy with your peace,

271
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,179
with everything you have got through Sahaja Yoga.

272
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,380
This is the biggest calamity that the world is facing today,

273
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:15,613
that those who are all so spiritual, those who have achieved great heights

274
00:28:15,713 --> 00:28:19,446
are least bothered as to what good has to be done.

275
00:28:19,813 --> 00:28:23,713
What they are doing is to enjoy their own spirituality,

276
00:28:24,513 --> 00:28:28,113
come to the puja, have more and more of it.

277
00:28:28,246 --> 00:28:34,380
But they have done no collective work to change people.

278
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:37,346
Some of them are working, one or two,

279
00:28:37,647 --> 00:28:40,213
but the rest of them are having a good time

280
00:28:40,446 --> 00:28:44,113
enjoying themselves in such a manner

281
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:50,413
that people accept them as great souls, good people, that's all.

282
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,780
I would like you to now introspect

283
00:28:54,146 --> 00:28:57,179
and find out how much collective work you have done,

284
00:28:57,446 --> 00:29:01,680
how many people you have got – like that.

285
00:29:02,113 --> 00:29:04,313
With whom are you talking?

286
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,580
How many people have you told about Sahaja Yoga?

287
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,113
Only so many are there.

288
00:29:10,346 --> 00:29:15,280
Christ had only twelve disciples; they were much more dynamic than you are.

289
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,346
So now you should take to the right side.

290
00:29:19,246 --> 00:29:23,113
And when you take to the right side we'll create dynamic people,

291
00:29:23,613 --> 00:29:32,513
not just some useless, patient, very quiet, peaceful people.

292
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,146
This was not the aim of Sahaja Yoga.

293
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:40,513
The aim of Sahaja Yoga is to change, change so many.

294
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,613
And those who are doing that, all My blessings are with them.

295
00:29:45,213 --> 00:29:49,813
But those who are just keeping to themselves, it is not a very good thing.

296
00:29:50,313 --> 00:29:53,780
In your country how many people have got to Sahaja Yoga?

297
00:29:54,113 --> 00:29:58,179
Just find out. With how many people you have worked it out?

298
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:03,380
So yours is not a complete yoga, yours is a partial yoga of the left side,

299
00:30:03,413 --> 00:30:06,580
where you are very loving, you are very kind, very this thing.

300
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:09,546
I am not saying that you should become aggressive in any way.

301
00:30:10,246 --> 00:30:15,747
But even I have seen people want to be leaders, they want to be something great;

302
00:30:16,179 --> 00:30:19,113
but how many people have they given realization?

303
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,680
How many people have they talked about Sahaja Yoga?

304
00:30:23,213 --> 00:30:26,213
I have said even in the aeroplane also you go,

305
00:30:26,446 --> 00:30:30,179
you walk in the street, anywhere people talk about Sahaja Yoga.

306
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,146
But here we are using Sahaja Yoga for our greatness,

307
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:39,713
for our understanding of ourselves.

308
00:30:40,146 --> 00:30:43,413
This is not why Sahaja Yoga has been brought to you.

309
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:50,213
It has been brought to you for giving realizations to many people.

310
00:30:51,313 --> 00:30:53,380
I request all the younger people, younger generation

311
00:30:53,413 --> 00:30:57,113
not to waste their Sahaj energies

312
00:30:57,213 --> 00:30:59,480
on nonsense as the old people have done.

313
00:31:00,113 --> 00:31:03,246
You’d better go ahead and talk to people about Sahaja Yog,

314
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,246
and spread the Sahaja Yoga.

315
00:31:05,546 --> 00:31:11,246
They are more interested in running schools, in looking after the destitute,

316
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:13,446
doing this, - doing that – that's not your job.

317
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:18,713
Your job is to create more Sahaja yogis, more Sahaja yoginis.

318
00:31:18,847 --> 00:31:23,280
But that is not there, what I find is it's not there.

319
00:31:23,613 --> 00:31:27,480
The right side is missing. You should come to the right side.

320
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:34,079
Go all ahead. Nothing will happen to you. Nobody can kill you,

321
00:31:34,346 --> 00:31:38,246
nobody can disturb you, nobody can arrest you, take it from Me.

322
00:31:38,513 --> 00:31:43,346
You have powers but if you don't use them, you are like this.

323
00:31:44,747 --> 00:31:48,647
That is why we have come to the stagnated point

324
00:31:49,146 --> 00:31:52,246
that we should know we have to use our right side.

325
00:31:52,513 --> 00:31:55,313
Right side is very important.

326
00:31:56,213 --> 00:32:00,480
Next time I'll tell you about right side, what right-sided things you have.

327
00:32:00,613 --> 00:32:03,546
Now you cannot become left-sided whatever you may try;

328
00:32:03,647 --> 00:32:08,446
so you use your right side in the right direction

329
00:32:08,747 --> 00:32:15,079
with the right understanding, not as some sort of,

330
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:22,480
I should say, very arbitrary or very dominating, like Hitlers.

331
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,280
We have had also Hitlers among Sahaja yogis.

332
00:32:26,513 --> 00:32:29,380
But now the time has come for you

333
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:33,580
to do something more than what the saints have done before,

334
00:32:34,213 --> 00:32:37,480
to work it out that way; not to keep to yourself

335
00:32:37,647 --> 00:32:42,113
that you have a family, you have very nice children,

336
00:32:42,113 --> 00:32:45,380
having, enjoying, all that – that's not the Sahaja Yoga for.

337
00:32:46,847 --> 00:32:51,680
Sahaja Yoga is for transforming the whole world.

338
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:57,546
You have to think about it: what are you doing, where are you,

339
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:02,246
and what have you achieved out of Sahaja Yoga?

340
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:06,346
Then we come to the Agnya.

341
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:12,780
In Agnya what has happened is Sahaja yogis are become, they have,

342
00:33:13,146 --> 00:33:19,146
they can bear anything, they can suffer anything – that's not we want.

343
00:33:20,046 --> 00:33:23,546
What we want, to remove the sufferings of others,

344
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,446
remove the aggression of others.

345
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:31,413
So we don't, that kind of organization we don't have,

346
00:33:32,113 --> 00:33:34,513
that kind of understanding we don’t have.

347
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:39,480
And if that works out, you will be different people.

348
00:33:40,113 --> 00:33:46,413
So we have become like saints, you see, sitting in their hermit halls,

349
00:33:46,413 --> 00:33:51,280
something like that, not more than that.

350
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:57,680
So better try to do something positive, without aggression.

351
00:33:57,847 --> 00:34:04,113
I know some of you are still very aggressive, are show-offs, I know that.

352
00:34:05,346 --> 00:34:12,613
But if you get into the mood of working out collectively,

353
00:34:13,413 --> 00:34:17,613
then you will realize what mistakes you have,

354
00:34:18,713 --> 00:34:24,580
still what is lacking in your personality – that is very important.

355
00:34:24,847 --> 00:34:28,613
At Agnya Chakra many Sahaja yogis falter,

356
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:32,680
I don't know what happens to them.

357
00:34:33,413 --> 00:34:36,613
At Agnya I have told that you must forgive.

358
00:34:37,213 --> 00:34:41,446
But that doesn't mean that you allow people to do wrong things.

359
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,580
Because you want to forgive it's very easy not to fight,

360
00:34:45,613 --> 00:34:49,546
not to say anything, just keep out, just forgive – no.

361
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:57,680
You go and talk to that person and tell him it is wrong.

362
00:35:00,246 --> 00:35:02,146
You have to face it.

363
00:35:03,146 --> 00:35:08,313
If you cannot face it then you are useless, just like any other people.

364
00:35:08,813 --> 00:35:12,580
What's the use of you people getting your realization?

365
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,680
So now we have to understand that it's not only that we have vibrations,

366
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,146
that we are all right,

367
00:35:22,246 --> 00:35:26,413
that you can cure some people is the last word – no.

368
00:35:27,313 --> 00:35:30,146
You have to spread it, you have to go in the public,

369
00:35:30,246 --> 00:35:33,246
you have to be collective on this point

370
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,546
and you have to spread Sahaja Yoga.

371
00:35:35,046 --> 00:35:41,246
With so many Sahaja yogis all over the world we have not progressed much.

372
00:35:42,146 --> 00:35:46,580
So now it is you have to plan what you want to do,

373
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,313
how you want to do it, and how you want to spread Sahaja Yoga.

374
00:35:50,613 --> 00:35:53,613
It's very important.

375
00:35:55,113 --> 00:36:02,113
Because you people are good at, say, talking about Sahaja Yoga,

376
00:36:02,113 --> 00:36:06,580
singing about Sahaja Yoga; all these things are useless unless and until

377
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:12,280
you have concrete proof of getting many more people in Sahaja Yoga.

378
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,546
In a small country like Turkey

379
00:36:16,146 --> 00:36:19,680
we have 25000 Sahaja yogis, what do you say?

380
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:28,079
They are all Muslims, twenty-five thousands Muslim becoming Sahaja yogis,

381
00:36:28,446 --> 00:36:34,113
while you find that number is very small in any other country.

382
00:36:35,246 --> 00:36:40,413
They are not very rich, but they care for their Self-realization

383
00:36:40,613 --> 00:36:43,513
and for toward giving Self-realizations to others.

384
00:36:44,113 --> 00:36:49,413
It's very surprising how it has worked out, how it has spread.

385
00:36:50,313 --> 00:36:58,680
So instead of thinking of your problems, of your enemies, of your powers,

386
00:36:59,113 --> 00:37:01,313
think of giving power to others

387
00:37:01,513 --> 00:37:05,413
and making them Sahaja Yoga – it's very important.

388
00:37:06,179 --> 00:37:10,313
If you are in Sahasrara then you have all the powers.

389
00:37:11,413 --> 00:37:14,313
In Sahasrara if you do not spread Sahaja Yoga,

390
00:37:14,513 --> 00:37:16,580
what's the use of getting realization?

391
00:37:16,847 --> 00:37:20,446
Just for yourself – it's being very selfish.

392
00:37:20,713 --> 00:37:29,613
So I would say that instead of spreading your own glory, your own name,

393
00:37:30,113 --> 00:37:33,713
please try to get more people to Sahaja Yoga.

394
00:37:34,313 --> 00:37:37,580
Go into a very dynamic force.

395
00:37:38,346 --> 00:37:40,480
So many people have complained to Me

396
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:44,546
that Sahaja yogis are nothing but dead people.

397
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,380
Is that what you are?

398
00:37:49,413 --> 00:37:55,380
Only single person like Me has done so much work, so why not you people?

399
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,413
In your country have you worked it out all over?

400
00:38:00,113 --> 00:38:01,680
Just think about it.

401
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:06,146
And that's why, unless and until you don't do it you are not sampurna,

402
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:07,380
you are not complete,

403
00:38:07,613 --> 00:38:12,580
and the Adi Shakti's powers you have not understood in its full form.

404
00:38:13,446 --> 00:38:17,079
That's why I'm telling you today it's a very important day

405
00:38:17,113 --> 00:38:19,346
that you worship Me as Adi Shakti.

406
00:38:19,546 --> 00:38:23,213
But you should know that Adi Shakti has to be a complete form.

407
00:38:23,546 --> 00:38:26,680
It cannot be only half left-sided – no.

408
00:38:28,246 --> 00:38:31,480
If that doesn't work out, then what's the use?

409
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:38,346
It's like any other getting any other realization – that's not so important.

410
00:38:39,346 --> 00:38:41,146
Not only that you should spread,

411
00:38:41,313 --> 00:38:45,580
but also you should make them, and realize it.

412
00:38:53,213 --> 00:38:58,446
All My blessings, all My love, all My powers I give you;

413
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,580
but try to understand. All right?

414
00:39:04,246 --> 00:39:07,046
Thank you very much.
