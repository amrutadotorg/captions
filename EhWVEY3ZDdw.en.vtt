WEBVTT

00:28.720 --> 00:32.760
Wish you a very very happy Diwali!

00:37.280 --> 00:40.720
To see all of you here

00:40.880 --> 00:46.920
is itself such a joy for Me

00:48.760 --> 00:55.440
that you all have taken to Sahaja Yoga

00:55.680 --> 00:58.600
in such a beautiful way.

00:59.640 --> 01:02.600
It’s your own,

01:03.280 --> 01:05.880
Self is your own,

01:06.040 --> 01:09.160
Spirit is your own.

01:10.240 --> 01:17.000
But ‘to take to Self’ is difficult.

01:17.480 --> 01:23.800
It’s only your desires, I think,

01:23.960 --> 01:27.200
which is being fulfilled.

01:27.360 --> 01:32.080
And that’s how you have got

01:32.240 --> 01:35.080
your Self-Realization.

01:35.240 --> 01:39.760
It cannot be forced, as you have known very well.

01:40.160 --> 01:45.880
It has to work out only with ‘your’ desire,

01:46.040 --> 01:55.280
only with ‘your’ surrendering.

02:10.280 --> 02:16.480
No use talking about it,

02:20.680 --> 02:25.960
no use convincing about it,

02:26.120 --> 02:29.280
what works out is your desire

02:29.440 --> 02:34.080
simple as that.

02:35.920 --> 02:41.240
The power of desire within you works it out.

02:41.400 --> 02:47.320
There are many who are not here,

02:48.600 --> 02:53.520
who have got their Realization all over the world.

02:53.680 --> 02:56.840
I remember all of them

02:58.240 --> 03:05.000
and all of you should remember them.

03:06.560 --> 03:09.920
Today is a nice day,

03:10.080 --> 03:14.280
when we can think

03:14.440 --> 03:18.560
of all those who are enlightened

03:18.720 --> 03:20.800
in this world.

03:21.760 --> 03:25.240
That’s the real Diwali:

03:25.640 --> 03:29.960
the enlightenment of human beings.

03:30.120 --> 03:36.240
Is not candle, is not some lamp,

03:36.400 --> 03:38.680
is human beings.

03:38.840 --> 03:42.560
If they are enlightened,

03:43.560 --> 03:48.040
then there’s no problem anymore left.

03:48.200 --> 03:52.880
The problems come with the people who are not enlightened.

03:53.040 --> 03:55.960
Because they are in the darkness,

03:56.120 --> 03:59.400
they are groping in the darkness

03:59.560 --> 04:02.800
and some of them are don’t know also that

04:02.960 --> 04:11.200
they are completely ignorant of realities.

04:11.880 --> 04:18.880
Once you come to Sahaja Yog

04:20.200 --> 04:23.960
and enlighten your Self,

04:24.120 --> 04:27.840
you ‘see’ in that light,

04:29.040 --> 04:35.600
in that light, what’s is good and what is bad

04:35.760 --> 04:38.200
to begin with.

04:38.360 --> 04:43.160
And then you grow into it beautifully,

04:43.880 --> 04:47.240
just like these flowers,

04:48.120 --> 04:52.040
who are all the time happy,

04:52.960 --> 04:56.760
all the time giving you joy.

04:56.920 --> 05:02.960
In the same way, when you are enlightened,

05:03.840 --> 05:10.600
with that light you don’t seek anything.

05:11.160 --> 05:16.280
You got everything, within you.

05:16.960 --> 05:22.440
Keep the lights on.

05:23.440 --> 05:26.640
But the another thing you can do is:

05:26.800 --> 05:30.800
with your light you can enlighten other people

05:30.960 --> 05:33.440
like we have done here,

05:33.600 --> 05:36.080
we had enlightened one candle,

05:36.240 --> 05:39.440
with that we have enlightened all of them.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.160
So you all can do it, because

05:42.320 --> 05:46.040
you have got that light within you.

05:46.200 --> 05:51.040
With that light, you can enlighten others

05:51.200 --> 05:57.360
and they can feel their joy of their Spirit.

05:59.120 --> 06:04.200
Is something to be seen now,

06:04.360 --> 06:08.880
like so many lights you have put.

06:10.880 --> 06:15.800
In the same way, ‘you’ are the lights

06:15.960 --> 06:18.960
for the whole world.

06:19.160 --> 06:24.480
Is not sufficient that you have got the light,

06:24.640 --> 06:30.280
but also you have to give light to others,

06:30.440 --> 06:35.400
you have to enlighten others, just like these candles.

06:35.560 --> 06:38.000
Once you start doing that,

06:38.160 --> 06:42.080
you will realize what you have got.

06:42.240 --> 06:45.080
And then you will respect your Self.

06:45.240 --> 06:51.720
And you will behave in a manner that behooves a saint,

06:51.880 --> 06:54.960
could be a sage

06:55.160 --> 06:59.440
without proclaiming anything.

06:59.960 --> 07:06.760
Inside your being you just develop that beautiful,

07:07.160 --> 07:14.800
extremely beautiful temperament that is joy giving.

07:16.160 --> 07:23.080
You don’t want to give any false ideas about yourself.

07:23.240 --> 07:27.360
Because, whatever is the truth, is with you.

07:27.520 --> 07:36.320
There’s no need to tell something untruth about yourself.

07:36.480 --> 07:42.240
People will realize that you are realized souls,

07:42.680 --> 07:50.880
they will just feel your subtle nature,

07:51.040 --> 07:52.440
your reality.

07:52.600 --> 07:57.920
Whether you come from India,

07:58.080 --> 08:07.240
or you come from England, or from America,

08:08.360 --> 08:16.440
you all have that ocean of love and knowledge within you.

08:16.600 --> 08:21.520
Be sure that is all there,

08:21.680 --> 08:27.880
only you first enjoy your own ocean of love.

08:28.120 --> 08:31.600
First you enjoy that

08:31.760 --> 08:35.600
and then you can enjoy in others also.

08:35.760 --> 08:38.080
I don’t have to tell you

08:38.240 --> 08:40.560
that “You love each other” or anything

08:40.720 --> 08:46.960
you just love, you just understand,

08:47.160 --> 08:52.240
you just spread your light among yourself.

08:53.160 --> 08:56.120
Sometimes you get frustrated

08:56.280 --> 08:59.240
with other people

09:00.080 --> 09:02.120
in your country, may be in your city,

09:02.280 --> 09:04.520
may be in your village

09:04.680 --> 09:09.120
that the people who are not yet enlightened.

09:10.080 --> 09:14.000
But best thing is to work it out,

09:14.160 --> 09:17.440
you have to work it out.

09:17.600 --> 09:21.160
You know, I had first one lady,

09:21.320 --> 09:25.600
very old lady one, who got her Realization from Me.

09:25.760 --> 09:28.720
And then, you all are here.

09:28.880 --> 09:33.040
In the same way you all can also

09:33.800 --> 09:38.120
do the job of Realization.

09:38.280 --> 09:41.760
For that you don’t need any calculations,

09:41.920 --> 09:45.560
you don’t need any thanksgiving

09:45.720 --> 09:49.600
it’s just there and it works out.

09:50.240 --> 09:54.280
What do you do for a light? - just see.

09:54.440 --> 09:58.880
You just put near the candle and you get the light.

09:59.040 --> 10:01.480
In the same way it is,

10:01.640 --> 10:04.320
your enlightenment is such

10:04.480 --> 10:06.880
that it will give

10:07.040 --> 10:13.080
light to thousands and thousands of people all over the world.

10:13.240 --> 10:16.720
As you know, there are many countries

10:16.880 --> 10:19.880
whom we have to still approach.

10:20.040 --> 10:22.960
But, we will do that.

10:23.120 --> 10:25.800
Just locate and find out

10:25.960 --> 10:28.080
where do you have to go

10:28.240 --> 10:32.000
and where you have to work.

10:33.240 --> 10:37.520
Firstly, you are capable of giving Realization,

10:37.680 --> 10:39.280
you are.

10:39.440 --> 10:41.240
Have confidence,

10:41.400 --> 10:44.560
that you can give Realization to people.

10:44.720 --> 10:49.600
For which you don’t need any help,

10:49.760 --> 10:54.840
single person can do it, thousands can do it.

10:54.960 --> 10:59.640
Is very important for the Diwali of the whole world

10:59.800 --> 11:05.040
that we should give Realization to people.

11:05.200 --> 11:08.400
Very important.

11:08.560 --> 11:14.720
Now, in Sahaj Yoga, many people are such

11:14.880 --> 11:18.480
who are little frustrated with themselves,

11:18.640 --> 11:20.560
specially with their past.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.840
Forget the past!

11:22.960 --> 11:27.720
Past is not important, what is important is present.

11:27.880 --> 11:33.280
At this present moment, what have you to do?

11:33.440 --> 11:36.560
You don’t have to worry about the past,

11:36.720 --> 11:38.680
that “I’ve done this, I’ve done that”

11:38.840 --> 11:40.680
what’s done is finished.

11:40.840 --> 11:45.120
Now you look out for the future.

11:45.280 --> 11:48.280
What can you do for the future.

11:48.440 --> 11:51.960
And some or other, with the light

11:52.120 --> 11:55.320
you see your path,

11:55.480 --> 11:58.800
you get rid of all the darkness

11:58.960 --> 12:02.520
and you know how far to go,

12:02.680 --> 12:05.200
how to reach people

12:05.360 --> 12:08.040
and how to spread Sahaj Yog.

12:08.200 --> 12:13.480
It’s something you have already within you,

12:13.640 --> 12:16.840
but you have to first of all

12:17.000 --> 12:19.880
establish your connection with it.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.240
If you have established your connection

12:22.400 --> 12:25.600
with that ocean that you have,

12:25.960 --> 12:28.880
you can definitely work it out,

12:29.040 --> 12:32.760
work it out in such a beautiful manner

12:32.920 --> 12:36.680
and you’ll be amazed how you’ll be successful.

12:36.960 --> 12:43.360
The success that you get out of all this ignorance,

12:43.520 --> 12:45.920
you are amazed at it.

12:46.080 --> 12:48.600
But you have the light.

12:48.760 --> 12:52.960
With the light you do remove all the darkness.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.720
Doesn’t have to think about it,

12:54.880 --> 12:57.800
just removes, because you have the light.

12:57.960 --> 13:01.200
But if you don’t have the light,

13:01.360 --> 13:05.080
then, no use talking about it.

13:05.240 --> 13:09.440
No use doing it, because,

13:09.600 --> 13:14.280
it doesn’t give any success.

13:14.440 --> 13:17.440
On the contrary, it’s a failure,

13:17.600 --> 13:19.800
failure of the worst type.

13:19.960 --> 13:24.160
And can be very dangerous for people.

13:27.440 --> 13:33.240
We have had very funny experiences also in the Sahaja Yoga.

13:33.400 --> 13:38.920
But, I think they all are learning one by one:

13:39.080 --> 13:41.200
that this should not have been done,

13:41.360 --> 13:43.560
that was wrong.

13:43.720 --> 13:48.920
Now, what blinds you we should find out.

13:49.080 --> 13:53.680
In this country, it’s such a money oriented country America is,

13:53.840 --> 13:56.640
which has spread all over the world.

13:56.800 --> 14:04.360
And being money oriented, you do get enamored,

14:04.520 --> 14:10.000
you do feel that you must make money out of Sahaj Yoga.

14:10.160 --> 14:13.280
There are some who do not think like that,

14:13.440 --> 14:17.720
but they are still running after making money.

14:17.880 --> 14:21.640
There is no need at all for you to make money

14:21.800 --> 14:28.600
or to find for yourself a kind of a security in money.

14:28.760 --> 14:33.560
Your security is inbuilt within you.

14:33.920 --> 14:42.480
So, all these outside things which are absolutely unnecessary

14:42.640 --> 14:46.120
should not blind you.

14:46.280 --> 14:50.000
Now, if you have the light, you can see it clearly.

14:50.160 --> 14:53.800
And this help of the Divine,

14:53.960 --> 14:57.240
you see that very clearly in your life

14:57.400 --> 14:59.480
and you are surprised

14:59.640 --> 15:03.400
how the Divine has helped you at different points.

15:03.560 --> 15:07.800
I get letters from people who say:

15:07.960 --> 15:10.040
“Mother, thank You very much,

15:10.200 --> 15:15.280
I got rid of my problem, I got rid of my enemies”,

15:15.440 --> 15:18.520
all kinds of things.

15:18.680 --> 15:21.040
While I have done nothing.

15:21.200 --> 15:26.200
It’s your light which has removed the darkness.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.680
If you are ignorant,

15:28.840 --> 15:32.160
then only the light can remove the darkness

15:32.320 --> 15:34.840
of your ignorance also.

15:34.960 --> 15:41.400
Actually, we don’t know how much

15:41.560 --> 15:45.120
there is the power of the light.

15:45.280 --> 15:47.640
As you can see here,

15:47.800 --> 15:54.640
every light is giving such a lot of,

15:54.800 --> 16:00.680
not only energy, but also complete picture.

16:00.960 --> 16:04.800
So thus you can make out,

16:04.960 --> 16:10.560
for example you can make out if somebody is a realized soul or not.

16:10.720 --> 16:13.000
Is not necessary

16:13.160 --> 16:16.000
that you have to go near that person

16:16.160 --> 16:20.840
or take any special care or anything.

16:21.000 --> 16:27.040
You will just know that this person is a realized soul or not.

16:27.200 --> 16:30.760
I’ve had many such experiences,

16:30.920 --> 16:37.720
where I found that people don’t know who is a realized soul,

16:37.880 --> 16:41.280
it’s very surprising.

16:41.440 --> 16:45.120
If you know who is a realized soul,

16:45.280 --> 16:49.360
then half of your problem is over.

16:49.720 --> 16:52.840
Now, the second one is the problem

16:53.000 --> 16:56.720
of how to convince that fellow

16:56.880 --> 17:00.520
what he is capable of doing.

17:00.680 --> 17:04.480
I find that problem also with Sahaja Yogis.

17:05.080 --> 17:11.160
They are capable of very great work

17:11.320 --> 17:13.800
all over the world,

17:13.960 --> 17:18.160
they can find out so many things,

17:18.320 --> 17:25.360
which normally, normal people cannot find out.

17:25.520 --> 17:30.360
But, Sahaja Yogis can immediately find out

17:30.520 --> 17:35.680
what sort of a person they are facing.

17:35.840 --> 17:37.360
This is the difference.

17:37.520 --> 17:40.000
That means you know the truth.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.720
Truth about everyone,

17:42.880 --> 17:46.880
truth about the whole situation.

17:47.040 --> 17:53.960
Truth about who is just boasting,

17:54.160 --> 17:57.520
or just making up a story,

17:57.680 --> 17:59.760
or some sort of a hypocrisy.

17:59.920 --> 18:04.160
It’s not difficult, because now you have the sight.

18:04.320 --> 18:07.280
You can see with your light

18:07.440 --> 18:12.320
what’s wrong or what’s good with others.

18:12.480 --> 18:15.600
Such a blessing it is for you,

18:15.760 --> 18:19.920
that you cannot be cheated.

18:20.080 --> 18:28.400
Because also, you are looked after by the Divine,

18:28.560 --> 18:32.040
guided all the time by the Divine.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.560
Have faith in the Divine,

18:34.720 --> 18:36.880
have faith in the Divine!

18:37.040 --> 18:39.560
That’s very important.

18:39.720 --> 18:43.040
As you have faith in a candle,

18:43.200 --> 18:48.720
have faith that the Divine will give you the light,

18:48.880 --> 18:51.520
will guide your path,

18:51.680 --> 18:55.320
will take you to right place

18:55.480 --> 18:57.600
to do the right things!

18:57.760 --> 19:00.920
I mean so many of these experiences are with you.

19:01.080 --> 19:05.760
I need not tell you how much people have written to Me,

19:05.920 --> 19:10.560
how they found things working out.

19:10.720 --> 19:16.320
Despite all that, we are collective,

19:16.480 --> 19:20.400
we are nice to each other,

19:20.560 --> 19:23.840
we don’t tell lies,

19:23.960 --> 19:28.640
we don’t try to destroy anyone.

19:28.800 --> 19:33.480
That means we are much above all human failings.

19:33.640 --> 19:37.280
And this is only because of the light.

19:37.440 --> 19:40.960
You can see where you are faltering.

19:41.120 --> 19:46.080
It’s just you see for yourself.

19:46.240 --> 19:48.600
For that, I think,

19:48.760 --> 19:53.520
meditation is the most important thing in Sahaj Yoga.

19:53.680 --> 19:57.080
Everyday you should do meditation.

19:57.240 --> 20:00.600
Those who do not do meditation

20:00.760 --> 20:04.640
are capable of falling down.

20:04.800 --> 20:12.320
Because meditation is like putting oil into the lamp.

20:12.480 --> 20:16.880
Those who do not meditate, think they can do without it,

20:17.040 --> 20:19.400
are sadly mistaken.

20:19.560 --> 20:25.880
They have to meditate, morning and evening.

20:26.080 --> 20:30.800
The problem is everything comes so handy,

20:30.960 --> 20:33.120
so simple,

20:33.280 --> 20:37.920
that they don’t understand that meditation is very important.

20:38.080 --> 20:40.560
Many people.

20:40.720 --> 20:45.160
Not you, but there are many I know, who get Realization,

20:45.320 --> 20:48.480
who don’t meditate.

20:48.640 --> 20:55.200
And their style is different,

20:55.360 --> 20:58.280
their nature is different.

20:58.440 --> 21:00.960
Meditation is such a soothing thing,

21:01.120 --> 21:09.320
such a beautiful way of connection with the Divine,

21:09.480 --> 21:13.440
that all your problems get solved

21:13.600 --> 21:16.720
in that meditative mood.

21:16.880 --> 21:20.520
If you are not meditating,

21:20.680 --> 21:24.720
you are not following meditation,

21:24.880 --> 21:27.880
then maybe your light will go down,

21:28.040 --> 21:31.560
it won’t give sufficient light.

21:35.320 --> 21:38.520
Is important, very important,

21:39.360 --> 21:44.560
to find out about yourself, about others

21:44.720 --> 21:47.720
in the meditation.

21:47.880 --> 21:52.080
“How to do meditation?”, many people ask Me.

21:52.240 --> 21:54.560
Don’t do anything

21:54.720 --> 21:58.400
to just go into thoughtless awareness.

21:58.560 --> 22:01.320
Try to go to the thoughtless awareness.

22:01.480 --> 22:07.360
If you can get into that condition of thoughtless awareness,

22:07.520 --> 22:09.800
you’ve done your job.

22:09.960 --> 22:12.400
Because that’s the point where

22:12.560 --> 22:17.080
you are with the truth, with the reality,

22:17.240 --> 22:18.640
with the joy,

22:18.800 --> 22:23.000
with everything that is so fundamental.

22:23.160 --> 22:27.200
When you meditate, try not to,

22:27.360 --> 22:34.120
not to make some sort of a function out of it, no.

22:34.280 --> 22:38.520
Meditation is something silencing your Self,

22:38.680 --> 22:43.720
silencing your thoughts and the going

22:43.880 --> 22:48.120
to that deep ocean which is within you itself.

22:48.280 --> 22:52.280
But supposing you don’t do that.

22:52.440 --> 22:54.400
If you don’t meditate,

22:54.560 --> 22:57.080
I can make out immediately

22:57.240 --> 23:00.160
those who are meditating and those who are not

23:00.320 --> 23:02.880
It’s not difficult for Me.

23:03.040 --> 23:07.680
Those who do not meditate are always hesitating,

23:08.600 --> 23:13.880
they are confused, they can’t understand.

23:14.040 --> 23:17.960
And that’s why meditation

23:18.120 --> 23:22.360
is the most important thing in Sahaj Yoga.

23:22.520 --> 23:26.240
Just like a light burns,

23:26.400 --> 23:29.560
in the electricity flowing in it, you can say,

23:29.720 --> 23:33.600
or by, because of the candles,

23:33.760 --> 23:37.160
in the same way meditation

23:37.320 --> 23:46.240
is a ‘continuous’ availability of the Divine Force.

23:46.440 --> 23:50.560
That will reduce all your apprehensions.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.600
Not only that,

23:52.760 --> 23:57.120
but takes out all the negative thoughts,

23:57.280 --> 24:03.360
it takes out all the discouraging things.

24:03.520 --> 24:07.560
And when you are meditating like that,

24:07.720 --> 24:10.600
thoughtless awareness,

24:10.760 --> 24:15.200
then you’ll be amazed how you are helped

24:15.360 --> 24:19.520
from within and without.

24:19.680 --> 24:22.640
It’s a terrible power that works,

24:22.800 --> 24:25.320
this thoughtless awareness.

24:25.480 --> 24:29.800
So those who do not meditate

24:29.960 --> 24:32.560
cannot go very much far

24:32.720 --> 24:36.240
with the advantage of Sahaja Yoga.

24:36.400 --> 24:39.560
One should try to meditate

24:39.720 --> 24:44.280
and go up to the point of thoughtless awareness.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.280
So, what happens to you?

24:48.440 --> 24:51.640
If you are in thoughtless awareness,

24:51.800 --> 24:54.320
what happens to you?

24:54.480 --> 25:02.320
Is that you get the confidence,

25:02.480 --> 25:07.680
complete confidence of Divinity,

25:08.840 --> 25:13.120
you know you have that.

25:13.280 --> 25:17.440
I’ve seen children coming from our school in Dharamsala:

25:17.600 --> 25:23.640
extremely confident and extremely humble.

25:23.800 --> 25:26.320
And I asked them: “What do you do?”

25:26.480 --> 25:30.920
They said: “Mother, we meditate.

25:31.080 --> 25:38.720
We meditate in the school in the evening

25:38.880 --> 25:41.800
and that meditation helps.”

25:41.960 --> 25:45.240
Imagine these small children can say that,

25:45.400 --> 25:48.840
so why not you also understand

25:49.000 --> 25:52.720
that meditation will give you security,

25:52.880 --> 25:56.840
it will give you real enlightenment

25:57.040 --> 26:01.800
and a complete connection with the Divine.

26:01.960 --> 26:06.320
Without the connection of the Divine,

26:06.480 --> 26:10.080
what’s the use of doing Sahaj Yoga?

26:18.920 --> 26:25.880
I know the people who are meditating,

26:26.480 --> 26:29.840
who have gone down into their being

26:29.960 --> 26:33.080
and who are very developed.

26:33.240 --> 26:37.400
Also I know people who are little superficial.

26:37.600 --> 26:41.360
Your depth is in thoughtless awareness.

26:41.520 --> 26:46.480
Is a very important point which you should reach.

26:46.640 --> 26:52.400
Looking at anything, if you are thoughtlessly aware,

26:52.560 --> 26:56.520
then you really become reflective about it,

26:56.680 --> 27:01.720
just works out that way.

27:01.880 --> 27:07.160
I don’t know how far you can remain in that condition.

27:07.320 --> 27:11.440
But even for a second you can achieve it,

27:11.600 --> 27:15.080
you’ll start achieving it more and more.

27:15.240 --> 27:18.440
I’ve talked so much about meditation before,

27:18.600 --> 27:24.040
but today when I see all these candles burning,

27:24.200 --> 27:27.520
I think they are all meditative,

27:27.680 --> 27:30.360
they are all in meditation

27:30.520 --> 27:33.720
and that’s how they are burning.

27:33.880 --> 27:39.480
In the same way, Sahaja Yogis who meditate, I know,

27:39.640 --> 27:42.000
and those who don’t, I know.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.000
And if they have problems,

27:44.160 --> 27:47.280
I know why the problems are there.

27:47.440 --> 27:50.560
Main thing is: your connection with the Divine

27:50.720 --> 27:54.680
is only possible when you meditate

27:54.840 --> 27:58.200
and become thoughtlessly aware.

27:58.360 --> 28:04.480
That’s the point where Divine works.

28:04.640 --> 28:06.760
It helps you.

28:06.920 --> 28:12.200
It comes to your help in such a way

28:12.360 --> 28:17.360
that you don’t know how you have achieved it.

28:17.520 --> 28:21.800
So thoughtless awareness is the first point

28:21.960 --> 28:24.760
all of you should achieve.

28:24.920 --> 28:27.120
Very important.

28:27.280 --> 28:32.240
After that you can achieve something else,

28:32.400 --> 28:36.320
but the first step is thoughtless awareness.

28:36.480 --> 28:43.320
Is very important to become thoughtlessly aware,

28:43.480 --> 28:46.960
because then there are no thoughts coming

28:47.120 --> 28:52.440
from the left or right, from the present or the future.

28:52.600 --> 28:57.440
Just in the present you are there.

28:57.600 --> 29:01.960
Is something you all have, is not that

29:02.120 --> 29:04.280
Me, I’m saying that to you,

29:04.440 --> 29:06.520
but all of you have this.

29:06.680 --> 29:08.480
But ‘steady yourself’!

29:08.640 --> 29:13.160
You have to steady yourself at thoughtless awareness.

29:13.320 --> 29:15.800
How long, that’s not the point.

29:15.960 --> 29:18.520
The point is once you touched it,

29:18.680 --> 29:21.040
you’ll go on touching it.

29:21.200 --> 29:28.000
Many people meditate, but their thought process is going on,

29:28.160 --> 29:33.560
they are not thoughtlessly silent.

29:33.720 --> 29:38.480
Now this is the one point which is very important.

29:38.640 --> 29:41.120
If you have to grow,

29:41.280 --> 29:44.760
you should be absolutely in connection with the Divine

29:44.920 --> 29:47.280
through thoughtless awareness.

29:47.440 --> 29:49.280
You don’t have to pray,

29:49.440 --> 29:51.880
you don’t have to call anyone, nothing,

29:52.040 --> 29:54.920
it just works because it is within you.

29:55.080 --> 29:57.240
All these thoughts are bombarding

29:57.400 --> 30:00.320
from both the sides in your mind.

30:00.480 --> 30:03.120
These thoughts that are coming to you

30:03.280 --> 30:05.960
have no meaning with you,

30:06.120 --> 30:09.040
they do not substantiate.

30:09.200 --> 30:12.360
Yourself you are an ocean

30:12.520 --> 30:18.960
and you have to get into that state of thoughtless awareness.

30:19.120 --> 30:24.080
It is always described in all the great books,

30:24.240 --> 30:27.800
but not so clearly as I am telling you.

30:27.960 --> 30:32.320
I don’t say that some of you do not get thoughtless awareness,

30:32.480 --> 30:34.600
so they are good for nothing, no.

30:34.760 --> 30:40.080
But, please try, you can all get into that state

30:40.240 --> 30:42.120
of thoughtless awareness.

30:42.280 --> 30:45.440
Even for a second if you get it,

30:45.600 --> 30:47.480
it’s a very good idea.

30:47.640 --> 30:53.320
Then you go on increasing that second.

30:54.600 --> 31:01.000
I think is a reflecting mind.

31:01.160 --> 31:04.560
When you look at something,

31:06.080 --> 31:09.920
you will become thoughtlessly aware.

31:10.560 --> 31:15.680
And then this mind reflects

31:16.120 --> 31:21.560
to the depth of what you see.

31:21.720 --> 31:24.720
That’s how you all will become really

31:24.880 --> 31:27.960
very creative Sahaja Yogis.

31:28.120 --> 31:36.800
What I find, that this state of thoughtless awareness

31:36.960 --> 31:41.120
is not established by many, which is not good.

31:41.280 --> 31:45.000
Today on this day of Diwali, I would say that:

31:45.160 --> 31:50.520
“You enlighten your Self with thoughtless awareness!”

31:50.680 --> 31:54.040
It is not difficult, is within you.

31:54.200 --> 31:58.080
Because thoughts are coming from this side and that side.

31:58.240 --> 32:02.760
And they are not the waves of your brain, no,

32:02.920 --> 32:05.520
just your own reactions.

32:05.680 --> 32:12.680
But, in case you meditate in the real sense of the word,

32:12.840 --> 32:16.360
then you will get into that thoughtless awareness.

32:16.520 --> 32:19.880
Which is a very important point

32:20.040 --> 32:23.360
and all these nonsensical thoughts,

32:23.520 --> 32:28.760
which are of no use to you, will disappear.

32:28.920 --> 32:34.480
They won’t be there and then your growth is possible

32:34.640 --> 32:37.920
and you’ll grow very well.

32:38.080 --> 32:41.240
Many people are here, who will say:

32:41.400 --> 32:43.640
“Mother, we don’t get that state.”

32:43.800 --> 32:45.960
Try,

32:46.120 --> 32:47.960
try that!

32:48.160 --> 32:51.360
I don’t believe you cannot get it.

32:51.520 --> 32:55.200
All of you can get that thought

32:55.360 --> 32:58.720
that “I can get it”, and you will get it.

32:58.880 --> 33:06.640
In that you don’t have to discard anything,

33:06.800 --> 33:13.680
you don’t have to see anything, just go into meditation

33:13.840 --> 33:17.800
and you’ll be amazed how it will work.

33:17.960 --> 33:21.560
Of course you are very much there, most of you,

33:21.720 --> 33:24.200
but still, I would say,

33:24.360 --> 33:31.320
increase that thoughtless awareness, that area!

33:31.480 --> 33:37.560
Today is very important because of this day of Diwali.

33:37.720 --> 33:43.240
Diwali is supposed to be enlightenment day.

33:43.400 --> 33:48.360
But enlightenment within is:

33:48.520 --> 33:52.920
how much you are in thoughtless awareness?

33:53.080 --> 33:55.440
And the everything works out,

33:55.600 --> 33:59.480
because you are the ocean of it,

33:59.640 --> 34:02.040
you have it within yourself.

34:02.200 --> 34:04.800
Only you have to tap it.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.560
If you don’t tap it,

34:07.720 --> 34:10.680
then it doesn’t work out.

34:10.840 --> 34:13.280
You have to just tap it

34:13.440 --> 34:18.960
and you’ll be amazed that you are a source of such joy,

34:19.160 --> 34:24.520
source of such happiness,

34:24.680 --> 34:29.280
I should say, source of real enlightenment.

34:29.440 --> 34:32.960
So, today’s message is that:

34:33.160 --> 34:38.720
“While meditating, go into thoughtless awareness.”

34:38.880 --> 34:42.320
No thought is important,

34:42.480 --> 34:45.640
because it’s your own creation.

34:45.800 --> 34:50.160
But if you have to become with the Divine Creation,

34:50.320 --> 34:54.560
you have to get to that state of thoughtless awareness,

34:54.720 --> 34:57.240
minimum of minimum.

34:57.400 --> 35:00.920
Once that comes to you, gradually it will grow

35:01.080 --> 35:03.920
and you’ll be amazed how

35:04.080 --> 35:09.120
you will be able to grow into Sahaja Yoga in a very big way.

35:09.320 --> 35:11.920
Thank you very much!
