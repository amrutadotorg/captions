00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.760
Wish you a very, very happy Diwali!

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.720
To see all of you here

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.920
is itself such a joy for Me

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.440
that you all have taken to Sahaja Yoga

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.600
in such a beautiful way.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.600
It’s your own,

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.880
Self is your own,

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.160
Spirit is your own.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:17.000
But ‘to take to Self’ is difficult.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.800
It’s only your desires, I think,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.200
which is being fulfilled.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.080
And that’s how you have got

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.080
your Self-Realization.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.760
It cannot be forced, as you have known very well.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.880
It has to work out only with ‘your’ desire,

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:55.280
only with ‘your’ surrendering.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.480
No use talking about it,

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.960
no use convincing about it,

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.280
what works out is your desire

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.080
simple as that.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.240
The power of desire within you works it out.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.320
There are many who are not here,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.520
who have got their Realization all over the world.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.840
I remember all of them

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:05.000
and all of you should remember them.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.920
Today is a nice day,

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.280
when we can think

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.560
of all those who are enlightened

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.800
in this world.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.240
That’s the real Diwali:

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.960
the enlightenment of human beings.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.240
It's not candle, is not some lamp,

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.680
is human beings.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.560
If they are enlightened,

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.040
then there’s no problem anymore left.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.880
The problems come with the people who are not enlightened.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.960
Because they are in the darkness,

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.400
they are groping in the darkness

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.800
and some of them are don’t know also that

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:11.200
they are completely ignorant of realities.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:18.880
Once you come to Sahaja Yoga

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.960
and enlighten your Self,

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.840
you ‘see’ in that light,

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.600
in that light, what’s is good and what is bad

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.200
to begin with.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.160
And then you grow into it beautifully,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.240
just like these flowers,

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.040
who are all the time happy,

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.760
all the time giving you joy.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:02.960
In the same way, when you are enlightened,

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:10.600
with that light you don’t seek anything.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.280
You got everything, within you.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.440
Keep the lights on.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.640
But the another thing you can do is:

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.800
with your light you can enlighten other people

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.440
like we have done here,

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.080
we had enlightened one candle,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.440
with that we have enlightened all of them.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.160
So you all can do it, because

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.040
you have got that light within you.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.040
With that light, you can enlighten others

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:57.360
and they can feel their joy of their Spirit.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.200
It's something to be seen now,

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.880
like so many lights you have put.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.800
In the same way, ‘you’ are the lights

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.960
for the whole world.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.480
It's not sufficient that you have got the light,

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:30.280
but also you have to give light to others,

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.400
you have to enlighten others, just like these candles.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.000
Once you start doing that,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.080
you will realize what you have got.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.080
And then you will respect your Self.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:51.720
And you will behave in a manner that behooves a saint,

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.960
could be a sage

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.440
without proclaiming anything.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:06.760
Inside your being you just develop that beautiful,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:14.800
extremely beautiful temperament that is joy giving.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:23.080
You don’t want to give any false ideas about yourself.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.360
Because, whatever is the truth, is with you.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:36.320
There’s no need to tell something untruth about yourself.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:42.240
People will realize that you are realized souls,

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:50.880
they will just feel your subtle nature,

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.440
your reality.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:57.920
Whether you come from India,

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:07.240
or you come from England, or from America,

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:16.440
you all have that ocean of love and knowledge within you.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:21.520
Be sure that is all there,

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:27.880
only you first enjoy your own ocean of love.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.600
First you enjoy that

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.600
and then you can enjoy in others also.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.080
I don’t have to tell you

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.560
that “You love each other” or anything

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:46.960
you just love, you just understand,

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:52.240
you just spread your light among yourself.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.120
Sometimes you get frustrated

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.240
with other people

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.120
in your country, may be in your city,

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.520
may be in your village

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:09.120
that the people who are not yet enlightened.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.000
But best thing is to work it out,

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.440
you have to work it out.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.160
You know, I had first one lady,

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.600
very old lady one, who got her Realization from Me.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.720
And then, you all are here.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.040
In the same way you all can also

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.120
do the job of Realization.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.760
For that you don’t need any calculations,

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.560
you don’t need any thanksgiving

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.600
it’s just there and it works out.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.280
What do you do for a light? - just see.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.880
You just put near the candle and you get the light.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.480
In the same way it is,

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.320
your enlightenment is such

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.880
that it will give

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:13.080
light to thousands and thousands of people all over the world.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.720
As you know, there are many countries

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.880
whom we have to still approach.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.960
But, we will do that.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.800
Just locate and find out

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.080
where do you have to go

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.000
and where you have to work.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.520
Firstly, you are capable of giving Realization,

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.280
you are.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.240
Have confidence,

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.560
that you can give Realization to people.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:49.600
For which you don’t need any help,

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:54.840
single person can do it, thousands can do it.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:59.640
It's very important for the Diwali of the whole world

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:05.040
that we should give Realization to people.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.400
Very important.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:14.720
Now, in Sahaja Yoga, many people are such

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.480
who are little frustrated with themselves,

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.560
specially with their past.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.840
Forget the past!

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.720
Past is not important, what is important is present.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:33.280
At this present moment, what have you to do?

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.560
You don’t have to worry about the past,

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.680
that “I’ve done this, I’ve done that”

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.680
what’s done is finished.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:45.120
Now you look out for the future.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.280
What can you do for the future.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.960
And some or other, with the light

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.320
you see your path,

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.800
you get rid of all the darkness

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.520
and you know how far to go,

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.200
how to reach people

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.040
and how to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:13.480
It’s something you have already within you,

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.840
but you have to first of all

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.880
establish your connection with it.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.240
If you have established your connection

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.600
with that ocean that you have,

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.880
you can definitely work it out,

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.760
work it out in such a beautiful manner

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.680
and you’ll be amazed how you’ll be successful.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:43.360
The success that you get out of all this ignorance,

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.920
you are amazed at it.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.600
But you have the light.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.960
With the light you do remove all the darkness.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.720
Doesn’t have to think about it,

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.800
just removes, because you have the light.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:01.200
But if you don’t have the light,

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.080
then, no use talking about it.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.440
No use doing it, because,

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:14.280
it doesn’t give any success.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.440
On the contrary, it’s a failure,

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.800
failure of the worst type.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.160
And can be very dangerous for people.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:33.240
We have had very funny experiences also in the Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:38.920
But, I think they all are learning one by one:

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.200
that this should not have been done,

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.560
that was wrong.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:48.920
Now, what blinds you we should find out.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:53.680
In this country, it’s such a money oriented country America is,

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.640
which has spread all over the world.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:04.360
And being money oriented, you do get enamored,

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:10.000
you do feel that you must make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.280
There are some who do not think like that,

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:17.720
but they are still running after making money.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.640
There is no need at all for you to make money

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:28.600
or to find for yourself a kind of a security in money.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:33.560
Your security is inbuilt within you.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:42.480
So, all these outside things which are absolutely unnecessary

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.120
should not blind you.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:50.000
Now, if you have the light, you can see it clearly.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.800
And this help of the Divine,

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:57.240
you see that very clearly in your life

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.480
and you are surprised

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:03.400
how the Divine has helped you at different points.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:07.800
I get letters from people who say:

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.040
“Mother, thank You very much,

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:15.280
I got rid of my problem, I got rid of my enemies”,

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.520
all kinds of things.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.040
While I have done nothing.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:26.200
It’s your light which has removed the darkness.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.680
If you are ignorant,

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:32.160
then only the light can remove the darkness

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.840
of your ignorance also.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:41.400
Actually, we don’t know how much

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:45.120
there is the power of the light.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.640
As you can see here,

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:54.640
every light is giving such a lot of,

00:15:54.800 --> 00:16:00.680
not only energy, but also complete picture.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.800
So thus you can make out.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:10.560
For example, you can make out if somebody is a Realized soul or not.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.000
It's not necessary

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.000
that you have to go near that person,

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:20.840
or take any special care or anything.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.040
You will just know that this person is a Realized soul or not.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.760
I’ve had many such experiences,

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:37.720
where I found that people don’t know who is a Realized soul,

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:41.280
it’s very surprising.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.120
If you know who is a Realized soul,

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.360
then half of your problem is over.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.840
Now, the second one is the problem

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.720
of how to convince that fellow

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:00.520
what he is capable of doing.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:04.480
I find that problem also with Sahaja Yogis.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:11.160
They are capable of very great work

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.800
all over the world.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:18.160
They can find out so many things,

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:25.360
which normally, normal people cannot find out.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:30.360
But, Sahaja Yogis can immediately find out

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:35.680
what sort of a person they are facing.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.360
This is the difference.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.000
That means you know the truth,

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.720
truth about everyone,

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.880
truth about the whole situation,

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:53.960
truth about who is just boasting,

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.520
or just making up a story,

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.760
or some sort of a hypocrisy.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:04.160
It’s not difficult, because now you have the sight.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.280
You can see with your light

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:12.320
what’s wrong or what’s good with others.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.600
Such a blessing it is for you,

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:19.920
that you cannot be cheated.

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:28.400
Because also, you are looked after by the Divine,

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:32.040
guided all the time by the Divine.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.560
Have faith in the Divine,

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.880
have faith in the Divine!

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.560
That’s very important.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:43.040
As you have faith in a candle,

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:48.720
have faith that the Divine will give you the light,

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.520
will guide your path,

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:55.320
will take you to right place

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.600
to do the right things!

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.920
I mean so many of these experiences are with you.

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:05.760
I need not tell you how much people have written to Me,

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:10.560
how they found things working out.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:16.320
Despite all that, we are collective,

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.400
we are nice to each other.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.840
We don’t tell lies.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:28.640
We don’t try to destroy anyone.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:33.480
That means we are much above all human failings.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.280
And this is only because of the light.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.960
You can see where you are faltering.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:46.080
It’s just you see for yourself.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.600
For that, I think,

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:53.520
meditation is the most important thing in Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:57.080
Everyday you should do meditation.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.600
Those who do not do meditation

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.640
are capable of falling down.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:12.320
Because meditation is like putting oil into the lamp.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.880
Those who do not meditate, think they can do without it,

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.400
are sadly mistaken.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:25.880
They have to meditate, morning and evening.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:30.800
The problem is everything comes so handy,

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.120
so simple,

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:37.920
that they don’t understand that meditation is very important.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.560
Many people.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:45.160
Not you, but there are many I know, who get Realization,

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.480
who don’t meditate.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:55.200
And their style is different,

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.280
their nature is different.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.960
Meditation is such a soothing thing,

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:09.320
such a beautiful way of connection with the Divine,

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:13.440
that all your problems get solved

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.720
in that meditative mood.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:20.520
If you are not meditating,

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:24.720
you are not following meditation,

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.880
then maybe your light will go down,

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:31.560
it won’t give sufficient light.

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:38.520
It's important, very important,

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:44.560
to find out about yourself, about others

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.720
in the meditation.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:52.080
“How to do meditation?”, many people ask Me.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.560
Don’t do anything

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:58.400
to just go into thoughtless awareness.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.320
Try to go to the thoughtless awareness.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:07.360
If you can get into that condition of thoughtless awareness,

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.800
you’ve done your job.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.400
Because that’s the point where

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:17.080
you are with the truth, with the reality,

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.640
with the joy,

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:23.000
with everything that is so fundamental.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:27.200
When you meditate, try not to,

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:34.120
not to make some sort of a function out of it, no.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:38.520
Meditation is something silencing yourself,

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:43.720
silencing your thoughts and the going

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:48.120
to that deep ocean which is within you itself.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:52.280
But supposing you don’t do that.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.400
If you don’t meditate,

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.080
I can make out immediately

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.160
those who are meditating and those who are not

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.880
It’s not difficult for Me.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:07.680
Those who do not meditate are always hesitating,

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:13.880
they are confused, they can’t understand.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:17.960
And that’s why meditation

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:22.360
is the most important thing in Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:26.240
Just like a light burns,

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.560
in the electricity flowing in it, you can say,

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:33.600
or by, because of the candles,

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.160
in the same way meditation

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:46.240
is a ‘continuous’ availability of the Divine Force.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:50.560
That will reduce all your apprehensions.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.600
Not only that,

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:57.120
but takes out all the negative thoughts,

00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:03.360
it takes out all the discouraging things.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:07.560
And when you are meditating like that,

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.600
thoughtless awareness,

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:15.200
then you’ll be amazed how you are helped

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:19.520
from within and without.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.640
It’s a terrible power that works,

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.320
this thoughtless awareness.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:29.800
So those who do not meditate

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.560
cannot go very much far

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:36.240
with the advantage of Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:39.560
One should try to meditate

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:44.280
and go up to the point of thoughtless awareness.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.280
So, what happens to you?

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.640
If you are in thoughtless awareness,

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.320
what happens to you?

00:24:54.480 --> 00:25:02.320
It's that you get the confidence,

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:07.680
complete confidence of Divinity,

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:13.120
you know you have that.

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:17.440
I’ve seen children coming from our school in Dharamsala:

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:23.640
extremely confident and extremely humble.

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.320
And I asked them: “What do you do?”

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:30.920
They said: “Mother, we meditate.

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:38.720
We meditate in the school in the evening

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.800
and that meditation helps.”

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.240
Imagine these small children can say that,

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:48.840
so why not you also understand

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.720
that meditation will give you security,

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.840
it will give you real enlightenment

00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:01.800
and a complete connection with the Divine.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:06.320
Without the connection of the Divine,

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:10.080
what’s the use of doing Sahaja Yoga?

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:25.880
I know the people who are meditating,

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.840
who have gone down into their being

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:33.080
and who are very developed.

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:37.400
Also I know people who are little superficial.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:41.360
Your depth is in thoughtless awareness.

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:46.480
It's a very important point which you should reach.

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:52.400
Looking at anything, if you are thoughtlessly aware,

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.520
then you really become reflective about it,

00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:01.720
just works out that way.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:07.160
I don’t know how far you can remain in that condition.

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:11.440
But even for a second you can achieve it,

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:15.080
you’ll start achieving it more and more.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:18.440
I’ve talked so much about meditation before,

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:24.040
but today when I see all these candles burning,

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:27.520
I think they are all meditative,

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.360
they are all in meditation

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:33.720
and that’s how they are burning.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:39.480
In the same way, Sahaja Yogis who meditate, I know,

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.000
and those who don’t, I know.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.000
And if they have problems,

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.280
I know why the problems are there.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.560
Main thing is your connection with the Divine

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:54.680
is only possible when you meditate

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:58.200
and become thoughtlessly aware.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:04.480
That’s the point where Divine works.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.760
It helps you.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:12.200
It comes to your help in such a way

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:17.360
that you don’t know how you have achieved it.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:21.800
So, thoughtless awareness is the first point

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.760
all of you should achieve.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:27.120
Very important.

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:32.240
After that, we can achieve something else,

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:36.320
but the first step is thoughtless awareness.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:43.320
It's very important to become thoughtlessly aware,

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:46.960
because then there are no thoughts coming

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:52.440
from the left or right, from the present or the future.

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:57.440
Just in the present you are there.

00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.350
It's something you all have.

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:04.162
It's not that, Me, I’m saying that to you,

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.520
but all of you have this.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.480
But steady yourself!

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:13.160
You have to steady yourself at thoughtless awareness.

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:15.800
How long, that’s not the point.

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:18.520
The point is once you touched it,

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:21.040
you’ll go on touching it.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:28.000
Many people meditate, but their thought process is going on,

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:33.560
they are not thoughtlessly silent.

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:38.480
Now this is the one point which is very important.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.120
If you have to grow,

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.760
you should be absolutely in connection with the Divine

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.280
through thoughtless awareness.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.280
You don’t have to pray,

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.880
you don’t have to call anyone, nothing,

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.920
it just works because it is within you.

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:57.240
All these thoughts are bombarding

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:00.320
from both the sides in your mind.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.120
These thoughts that are coming to you

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.960
have no meaning with you,

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:09.040
they do not substantiate.

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:12.360
Yourself you are an ocean

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:18.960
and you have to get into that state of thoughtless awareness.

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:24.080
It is always described in all the great books,

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.800
but not so clearly as I am telling you.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:32.320
I don’t say that some of you do not get thoughtless awareness,

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.600
so they are good for nothing, no.

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:40.080
But, please try, you can all get into that state

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.120
of thoughtless awareness.

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.440
Even for a second if you get it,

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.480
it’s a very good idea.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:53.320
Then you go on increasing that second.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:31:01.000
I think is a reflecting mind.

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.560
When you look at something,

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.920
you will become thoughtlessly aware.

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:15.680
And then this mind reflects

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:21.560
to the depth of what you see.

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.720
That’s how you all will become really

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.960
very creative Sahaja Yogis.

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:36.800
What I find, that this state of thoughtless awareness

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:41.120
is not established by many, which is not good.

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:45.000
Today on this day of Diwali, I would say that

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:50.520
you enlighten yourself with thoughtless awareness.

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:54.040
It is not difficult, it's within you.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:58.080
Because thoughts are coming from this side and that side.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:02.760
And they are not the waves of your brain, no,

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:05.520
just your own reactions.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:12.680
But, in case you meditate in the real sense of the word,

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:16.360
then you will get into that thoughtless awareness,

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:19.880
which is a very important point.

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:23.360
And all these nonsensical thoughts,

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:28.760
which are of no use to you, will disappear.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:34.480
They won’t be there and then your growth is possible

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:37.920
and you’ll grow very well.

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.240
Many people are here, who will say:

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.640
“Mother, we don’t get that state.”

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.960
Try,

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:47.960
try that.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:51.360
I don’t believe you cannot get it.

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:55.200
All of you can get that thought

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:58.720
that “I can get it”, and you will get it.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:06.640
In that you don’t have to discard anything,

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:13.680
you don’t have to see anything, just go into meditation

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:17.800
and you’ll be amazed how it will work.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:21.560
Of course you are very much there, most of you,

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.200
but still, I would say,

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:31.320
increase that thoughtless awareness, that area!

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:37.560
Today is very important because of this day of Diwali.

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:43.240
Diwali is supposed to be enlightenment day.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:48.360
But enlightenment within is

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:52.920
how much you are in thoughtless awareness.

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.440
And the everything works out,

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:59.480
because you are the ocean of it,

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:02.040
you have it within yourself.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.800
Only you have to tap it.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.560
If you don’t tap it,

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:10.680
then it doesn’t work out.

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.280
You have to just tap it

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:18.960
and you’ll be amazed that you are a source of such joy,

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:24.520
source of such happiness,

00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:29.280
I should say, source of real enlightenment.

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:32.960
So, today’s message is that

00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:38.720
while meditating, go into thoughtless awareness.

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:42.320
No thought is important,

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.640
because it’s your own creation.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:50.160
But if you have to become with the Divine Creation,

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:54.560
you have to get to that state of thoughtless awareness,

00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:57.240
minimum of minimum.

00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:00.920
Once that comes to you, gradually it will grow

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.920
and you’ll be amazed how

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:09.120
you will be able to grow into Sahaja Yoga in a very big way.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.920
Thank you very much.
