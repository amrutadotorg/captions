00:01:19.525 --> 00:01:25.807
I’m sorry for being late but I have been
working, I tell you, since morning.

00:01:26.008 --> 00:01:32.613
Now, today we are here

00:01:32.814 --> 00:01:36.527
to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.

00:01:36.728 --> 00:01:43.628
Resurrection of Christ has the greatest
significance for all the Sahaj Yogis.

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.731
And we have to understand that He
resurrected Himself

00:01:48.932 --> 00:01:52.273
so that we could resurrect ourselves.

00:01:52.474 --> 00:01:58.272
The message of His life is His resurrection
and not His cross.

00:01:58.473 --> 00:02:04.222
He bore the cross for us and we don’t have
to bear anymore.

00:02:04.423 --> 00:02:07.704
I see lots of people having this drama
going on:

00:02:07.905 --> 00:02:11.548
they are carrying the cross across

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:15.314
to show as if we are going to do the job
for Christ!

00:02:15.515 --> 00:02:20.661
As if He has left some work to be done
by these people who play a drama.

00:02:20.862 --> 00:02:25.388
But all this drama is to deceive yourself
and to deceive others.

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:34.850
There’s no sense in playing such useless
things to show how Christ suffered.

00:02:35.051 --> 00:02:39.286
To make you weep and to make you cry,
Christ did not suffer.

00:02:39.487 --> 00:02:43.487
He suffered that you should enjoy,
that you should be happy,

00:02:43.688 --> 00:02:49.524
that you should lead a life of complete
bliss and gratitude

00:02:49.725 --> 00:02:52.498
to the Almighty who has created you.

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:55.382
He would never like you to be unhappy.

00:02:55.583 --> 00:03:00.083
Which father would like his son to be
unhappy?

00:03:00.284 --> 00:03:06.314
So we have to understand that His message
of His life,

00:03:06.515 --> 00:03:12.740
why He came on this Earth to do the
greatest job is that of resurrection.

00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:18.065
If He had not resurrected Himself, I could
not have worked out Sahaj Yoga.

00:03:18.266 --> 00:03:22.139
So we have to be eternally thankful
to His life and to Him,

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.923
the way He did all these difficult tasks,
taking upon Himself.

00:03:29.124 --> 00:03:32.350
That, we cannot do, we human beings, cannot
do it.

00:03:32.551 --> 00:03:36.853
It’s only He being the Divine, He being
the Om,

00:03:37.054 --> 00:03:43.338
He being the Logos, He being the Brahma
could do it.

00:03:43.933 --> 00:03:47.023
But now you all have ascended.

00:03:47.224 --> 00:03:52.559
I can see on your faces: Christ writ large
on your faces.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.984
It’s beautifully shining in your eyes and
twinkling.

00:03:57.185 --> 00:04:02.506
He’s there within us, in our hearts,
in our eyes,

00:04:02.707 --> 00:04:08.022
and He has resurrected Himself and
He has resurrected you, too.

00:04:08.223 --> 00:04:12.174
But now it is for you to resurrect other
people.

00:04:12.375 --> 00:04:16.599
You can resurrect other people, this is
the power you have got it

00:04:16.904 --> 00:04:20.100
through Him, maybe, or through your
Kundalini.

00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:23.728
But you have this power to resurrect other
people,

00:04:23.929 --> 00:04:28.041
but first and foremost thing [is] you have
to be strong like Christ:

00:04:28.242 --> 00:04:35.251
how He obeyed His Mother and how He
obeyed all the demands of His life.

00:04:35.452 --> 00:04:42.138
How He was committed and how He dedicated
Himself to this single task.

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:46.754
He didn’t bother as to develop His monetary
side

00:04:46.955 --> 00:04:49.564
or to become some sort of a big officer

00:04:49.764 --> 00:04:53.560
or to become another great rider,
or a swimmer,

00:04:53.761 --> 00:04:58.646
or climb on the Alps, some sort of a thing
like that.

00:05:00.154 --> 00:05:04.921
He didn’t try all these tricks, and didn’t
try to hanker after all these things

00:05:05.122 --> 00:05:10.414
that sometimes make us quite mad.

00:05:10.615 --> 00:05:22.656
What He did was to establish His identity
as the Brahma itself,

00:05:22.857 --> 00:05:27.573
as the Divine vibrations itself, which He
established.

00:05:27.774 --> 00:05:34.484
And what you have to do is to establish
yourself as the resurrected people,

00:05:34.685 --> 00:05:39.476
as the realised souls, as the Sahaj Yogis.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.724
And this is going to be very easy.

00:05:42.925 --> 00:05:47.427
Now everything is made easy for you:
your realisation,

00:05:47.628 --> 00:05:55.299
then your powers, everything has
beautifully settled within you.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.682
It has worked out so beautifully, slowly
and steadily.

00:05:59.905 --> 00:06:09.531
I don’t think I have ever tried to force
you to do something

00:06:09.732 --> 00:06:13.275
or have compelled you to do something.

00:06:13.481 --> 00:06:18.199
But through your own ascent you can see
what’s wrong with you

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.472
or with the people about whom we are
talking.

00:06:22.673 --> 00:06:31.244
And then you can also know through all
these powers whatever is to be known.

00:06:31.445 --> 00:06:35.617
All that is unknown can be your own,
everything.

00:06:35.826 --> 00:06:40.613
But the attention should be towards your
ascent, towards the state.

00:06:40.814 --> 00:06:45.579
Now ascent is not some sort of a physical
process.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.940
It is not that you ascend some staircases.

00:06:49.141 --> 00:06:55.141
It is a state. It’s a state of your
personality.

00:06:55.342 --> 00:06:57.326
And there where I always say…

00:06:57.527 --> 00:07:02.874
Excuse me, I think I’ll... The sun is
showing its results.

00:07:03.075 --> 00:07:05.064
See how the sun listens to me!

00:07:05.265 --> 00:07:08.603
Can you help me, a little bit, to take out
things.

00:07:08.804 --> 00:07:13.629
Very hot for me, I don’t know what
about you people.

00:07:13.994 --> 00:07:17.550
He’s just telling me off (the Sun).

00:07:33.662 --> 00:07:36.961
I forgot to tell you about the Sun so he’s
just troubling me,

00:07:37.162 --> 00:07:40.199
so I better tell!

00:07:53.174 --> 00:08:00.236
They have been telling for the last one
year, you see,

00:08:00.437 --> 00:08:04.838
we’ve been thinking of coming here
for this puja.

00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:09.906
And I was very anxious that we should have
the Easter Puja here,

00:08:10.107 --> 00:08:13.258
but the dates were not very suitable,

00:08:13.459 --> 00:08:16.364
because those days the moon would be
waning.

00:08:16.565 --> 00:08:19.219
So I thought, “How will I do it without
the moon?

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.524
We have to have the moon there.
It’s important.”

00:08:22.725 --> 00:08:26.567
So I thought, “We’ll have it sometimes
later.”

00:08:26.768 --> 00:08:31.573
And suddenly it happened that I had to come
here: luckily I was here.

00:08:31.774 --> 00:08:35.489
And then on the television for the last one
week, they have been telling

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:41.556
that it’s going to rain heavily, it’s going
to be very clouded

00:08:41.757 --> 00:08:44.768
and the temperature is going to be very bad

00:08:44.969 --> 00:08:51.442
and it’s going to be very, very heavy
rains.

00:09:05.005 --> 00:09:08.260
And again and again, every night, every
time

00:09:08.461 --> 00:09:13.959
they announced about the weather it was
looking even worse, every time.

00:09:14.173 --> 00:09:19.360
So I thought, “Now what to do?”

00:09:22.431 --> 00:09:25.462
If you ask the clouds to move out

00:09:25.681 --> 00:09:31.890
you have to have a tremendous breeze
and that may spoil your tent.

00:09:32.091 --> 00:09:34.410
So somehow or other, you see,

00:09:34.611 --> 00:09:40.530
I just told the clouds that, “You’d better
move on to Newfoundland,

00:09:40.731 --> 00:09:47.186
slowly, steadily, not with great speed.”
And they did it.

00:09:49.237 --> 00:09:52.365
And then the Sun which was very bright came
out.

00:09:52.566 --> 00:09:56.539
Early in the morning I saw Him, red like my
sari.

00:09:56.753 --> 00:10:03.097
So beautiful it was. And you were all
asleep but I was awake, very early.

00:10:03.298 --> 00:10:08.985
And I was watching the way it came up: just
like my bindi it came up.

00:10:09.186 --> 00:10:12.516
I saw it, and I said, “Look at the sun!

00:10:12.717 --> 00:10:19.130
How obedient, how dedicated, how
beautiful!”

00:10:19.331 --> 00:10:22.563
Whatever it is: today is Mother’s Puja,

00:10:22.764 --> 00:10:27.862
you have to have proper light, you have
to have proper temperature.

00:10:28.063 --> 00:10:30.812
So look at the sky! Look at everything!

00:10:31.013 --> 00:10:34.830
And then gradually it became pink like your
faces.

00:10:35.031 --> 00:10:40.232
It’s beautiful! It became pink, beautifully
pink, and then now it’s shining.

00:10:40.433 --> 00:10:47.152
I’m sorry I should have given full tribute
to the Sun, the way He has acted.

00:10:47.353 --> 00:10:52.866
So that’s why He is troubling me a little
bit, you see, to remind me!

00:10:54.551 --> 00:11:06.213
So, as you know the Sun is the Agnya
chakra.

00:11:06.484 --> 00:11:11.577
Christ resides in the Sun.

00:11:11.823 --> 00:11:20.410
And in the body, in the being, He is
the Spirit.

00:11:20.611 --> 00:11:23.058
When He’s the Spirit, He’s the moon.

00:11:23.273 --> 00:11:27.676
And when He acts on the Agnya, He’s
the Sun.

00:11:27.877 --> 00:11:32.643
Now we have seen in His life

00:11:32.844 --> 00:11:38.603
that He was absolutely spotlessly
immaculate.

00:11:38.969 --> 00:11:46.889
He had no defects in Him. He was
a perfect personality.

00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:51.413
“Then why did He want to resurrect?”, one
can ask.

00:11:51.614 --> 00:11:55.940
What is in His time, is the resurrection.

00:11:56.141 --> 00:12:03.561
His resurrection is like making the way
through the Agnya chakra

00:12:03.762 --> 00:12:07.452
for all of you to pass through it.

00:12:07.653 --> 00:12:12.155
He was like the gate, or we should say
He was the One

00:12:12.356 --> 00:12:16.787
who opened the gate for all of
you.

00:12:16.988 --> 00:12:20.755
Because He was so perfect,

00:12:21.172 --> 00:12:25.778
He had no problems as we have of our
chakras, our Kundalini.

00:12:25.979 --> 00:12:34.566
He had no problems. But He was
the complete compassion

00:12:34.767 --> 00:12:43.269
in the nature of vibrations: the vibrations
became complete compassion.

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:47.412
So much so that even when He was
resurrected

00:12:47.613 --> 00:12:52.189
and even before that when He was crucified

00:12:52.390 --> 00:13:00.016
He said that, “Oh, God, the Father, please
forgive those people

00:13:00.217 --> 00:13:02.989
because they do not know what they
are doing.‎”

00:13:03.219 --> 00:13:07.036
Such forgiveness, such compassion!

00:13:07.237 --> 00:13:10.925
And the Mother had to watch all that,
keeping quiet,

00:13:11.148 --> 00:13:16.311
because that was the game, that was
the thing one had to do.

00:13:16.512 --> 00:13:20.229
He had to play His game and He played it
so well.

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:25.282
So now when we talk about Christ, we have
to remember one thing:

00:13:25.483 --> 00:13:31.485
that He has done all this for us, now what
are we going to do for Him?

00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:34.187
He is the pattern we have to follow.

00:13:34.388 --> 00:13:37.064
Supposing if that is the pattern we have to
follow,

00:13:37.265 --> 00:13:42.676
then it’s not that we carry the cross
on our shoulder.

00:13:42.877 --> 00:13:44.981
That’s not the pattern you have to follow.

00:13:45.182 --> 00:13:48.115
Many people think [that] because He carried
the cross, we can carry the cross.

00:13:48.316 --> 00:13:50.212
Anybody can carry the cross!

00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:58.384
In India, if you give about five rupees to
a loader, he can carry a cross across!

00:13:58.585 --> 00:14:00.365
What is so great about it?

00:14:00.603 --> 00:14:05.773
What is so great in carrying a cross
on your shoulder?

00:14:05.974 --> 00:14:10.818
It’s nothing something great. Any wrestler
can do it, anybody can do it.

00:14:11.026 --> 00:14:15.213
That’s not the point! The point is we have
to carry

00:14:15.414 --> 00:14:20.704
the work of Christ, of resurrection.
That is what we have to realise.

00:14:20.904 --> 00:14:26.649
We have to understand the importance
of our being, of our lives,

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:31.987
like Christ understood that He has come
for this great job here.

00:14:32.188 --> 00:14:34.336
And though He came as a human being,

00:14:34.537 --> 00:14:39.050
though He came as an ordinary son
of an ordinary carpenter.

00:14:39.251 --> 00:14:44.643
Though on this Earth He had a body and He
lived like other human beings,

00:14:44.857 --> 00:14:48.715
still He knew what He had to do,

00:14:48.916 --> 00:14:52.324
He knew what He had to achieve and He
achieved it.

00:14:52.524 --> 00:14:55.512
I think His was the most difficult task,

00:14:55.734 --> 00:14:59.075
which He achieved and which He
furnished it, so well,

00:14:59.276 --> 00:15:02.768
that today we are having all the benefits
of that.

00:15:02.969 --> 00:15:07.498
Now let us see if we have done something
for Sahaj Yoga or not.

00:15:07.699 --> 00:15:11.484
We all should examine ourselves: what have
we done for Sahaj Yoga?

00:15:11.684 --> 00:15:14.373
Not carrying the cross, I mean to say.

00:15:14.574 --> 00:15:18.056
Some people think when they travel in India
and if they carry

00:15:18.257 --> 00:15:22.092
the luggage of people downward, they are
carrying the cross of Christ.

00:15:22.293 --> 00:15:23.610
That’s not the way!

00:15:23.811 --> 00:15:26.877
It’s something very, very serious one has
to think about.

00:15:27.084 --> 00:15:34.583
And that seriousness is: how far we have
achieved that state,

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.965
for that what have we done?

00:15:37.166 --> 00:15:40.175
And a simple thing I have been asking
all of you:

00:15:40.376 --> 00:15:43.999
you have to meditate every day!

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.596
All of you have to meditate everyday.

00:15:47.797 --> 00:15:52.839
But somehow nobody has time to meditate.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:58.857
We are having these watches just to know
that we have to meditate,

00:15:59.058 --> 00:16:02.375
not for anything else. Our lives are
for meditation.

00:16:02.576 --> 00:16:07.950
You need not spend all your twenty-four
hours, but you have to meditate!

00:16:08.151 --> 00:16:13.102
Everyday you must meditate. If you
meditate your children will meditate.

00:16:13.303 --> 00:16:18.257
And meditation is such a simple thing
for you, made so easy

00:16:18.458 --> 00:16:22.720
that all the elements you can see work
it out.

00:16:22.921 --> 00:16:25.931
All your chakras are made of different
elements

00:16:26.132 --> 00:16:29.633
and when you clear out with the different
style —

00:16:29.834 --> 00:16:33.416
I mean, you know all the methods and
the techniques of Sahaj Yoga —

00:16:33.617 --> 00:16:37.624
with that when you clear out the chakras,
when you clear them out

00:16:37.825 --> 00:16:46.200
you are absolutely free, absolutely at that
stage where you have to be.

00:16:46.401 --> 00:16:50.659
But if you do not do this much even —
is to meditate —

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:55.445
it’s going to be very, very difficult
for me and for you

00:16:55.646 --> 00:16:59.512
to achieve, for which you have come
on this Earth.

00:16:59.713 --> 00:17:03.669
It’s a tremendous task that I have taken
over, I know that,

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:07.675
but I know how to do it, and you also
know how to do it.

00:17:07.876 --> 00:17:14.021
But the trouble is you get entangled into
your different conditionings.

00:17:14.222 --> 00:17:18.045
Now, by now you must have realised,
all these so-called religions

00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:23.150
in anybody’s name: whether it is in the
name of Islam, in the name of Christianity,

00:17:23.351 --> 00:17:29.925
in the name of Hinduism, in the name
of Sikhism — all this is falsehood.

00:17:30.126 --> 00:17:34.171
It has no truth in it.

00:17:34.372 --> 00:17:38.221
They have all tried to use it for their
own purposes.

00:17:38.422 --> 00:17:44.107
There’s only one truth and that is:
all these great prophets

00:17:44.308 --> 00:17:48.897
and all these great incarnations came
on this Earth for your ascent

00:17:49.098 --> 00:17:55.071
and not for establishing those religions
who are just interested in money.

00:17:55.272 --> 00:17:58.060
In these religions also you will find
there are people

00:17:58.261 --> 00:18:01.269
who are either left-sided or right-sided.

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:06.045
There are some religions which preach
you should be very, very strict:

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.862
you should not do this, you should not
do that,

00:18:09.063 --> 00:18:11.425
you should not drink, you should not smoke.

00:18:11.626 --> 00:18:15.334
There are some who say you should not
marry, you should not look at women,

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:18.925
you should not look at men — all kinds
of restrictions.

00:18:19.147 --> 00:18:23.658
Even in Hinduism you will be surprised,
there are so many restrictions.

00:18:23.859 --> 00:18:31.517
If you see the amount of superstitions
that exist

00:18:31.718 --> 00:18:35.953
and that are created by brahmins in India
you will be shocked.

00:18:36.153 --> 00:18:38.031
For everything there’s a superstition:

00:18:38.232 --> 00:18:41.342
if you walk with the left hand ahead,
that means this,

00:18:41.543 --> 00:18:44.383
if you walk with the right hand, then
that means this;

00:18:44.584 --> 00:18:47.961
if you sit like this, that means that.
Everything!

00:18:48.162 --> 00:18:52.501
They have made a human being into a machine
and there’s no spontaneity about it.

00:18:52.702 --> 00:18:55.996
All kinds of absurdities there are
in Islam, too.

00:18:56.197 --> 00:19:00.451
But when we find them in a free place
like England,

00:19:00.652 --> 00:19:04.502
where there’s complete left-sidedness,
where you can do what you like,

00:19:04.703 --> 00:19:07.569
still you are a Christian: if you drink,
it’s all right;

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:12.252
if you have ten wives, it’s all right; you
have fifteen keeps, it’s all right.

00:19:12.453 --> 00:19:17.938
Anything you do is all right as long as you
go to church and pay money!

00:19:18.829 --> 00:19:23.303
So there’s nothing, especially for
the Protestants –

00:19:23.504 --> 00:19:28.263
that’s the religion I was born in, where
everything is allowed.

00:19:28.464 --> 00:19:32.170
Now when we come to this kind of a thing,
what is the Christian religion is,

00:19:32.385 --> 00:19:35.042
then, comes to, that, if you ask them
the road,

00:19:35.243 --> 00:19:40.207
they’ll tell you which way to go — that’s
Christianity. It’s coming to that end.

00:19:40.408 --> 00:19:45.008
Now, all these religions either are
indulging into the Right Side

00:19:45.209 --> 00:19:46.891
or onto the Left Side.

00:19:47.092 --> 00:19:51.852
Some people like the Left Side and some
people like the Right Side.

00:19:52.053 --> 00:19:55.283
I will tell you the story of a priest,
I went to see him in Russia.

00:19:55.484 --> 00:19:58.774
I think I have told it to some people
before.

00:19:58.975 --> 00:20:04.542
I went to Russia and the Russian people
asked me, “What would you like to see?”

00:20:04.743 --> 00:20:07.707
So I told them I would like to go and see
some churches.

00:20:07.908 --> 00:20:10.434
So they said, “All right, very good, we’ll
take you to a church.”

00:20:10.634 --> 00:20:15.803
So they took me to church and it was that
Greek Orthodox Church, you see,

00:20:16.004 --> 00:20:20.228
and a Black Order, which is supposed to be
the highest. I don’t know how they call it.

00:20:20.429 --> 00:20:25.979
So we went inside and the priest said,
“All right, today I’m sorry,

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:31.194
we cannot offer you meat because our
fasting is there. But we’ll have lunch.”

00:20:31.394 --> 00:20:33.445
So we had a very sumptuous lunch and
all that.

00:20:33.646 --> 00:20:36.928
But the priest was only busy drinking,
because it was a fasting,

00:20:37.129 --> 00:20:39.499
so drinking is allowed, according to them.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.874
So he was drinking and drinking and
drinking.

00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:45.140
He drank so much that he forgot that
we were there!

00:20:45.341 --> 00:20:49.011
We were supposed to be VIPs, you see:
just lost himself into drinking!

00:20:49.218 --> 00:20:52.513
So we thought better now have an honourable
retreat, you see.

00:20:52.714 --> 00:20:57.069
So we got up and walked out of that place

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:59.031
and this fellow didn’t even come
to wish us.

00:20:59.232 --> 00:21:02.193
And these officers, the Russian officers,
didn’t drink,

00:21:02.394 --> 00:21:04.923
and didn’t do anything, and they were
laughing and laughing.

00:21:05.124 --> 00:21:06.996
He said, “See now, this is Christianity!

00:21:07.197 --> 00:21:10.016
That’s why we didn’t want to take
to Christianity.”

00:21:10.217 --> 00:21:13.168
So I said, “But see, that’s not Christ.”

00:21:13.369 --> 00:21:16.975
They said, “That’s true, but what these
people are saying, is it Christianity?”

00:21:17.176 --> 00:21:18.794
I said, “It’s not.”

00:21:18.994 --> 00:21:23.414
Now this gentleman, you see, was supposed
to be

00:21:23.615 --> 00:21:28.598
the highest person in spirituality living
in Russia!

00:21:28.799 --> 00:21:31.928
So they have told me a story about
the tzars.

00:21:32.129 --> 00:21:35.623
You see, tzars wanted to have some religion
because they thought,

00:21:35.824 --> 00:21:40.031
“Everybody’s having a religion, we have
no religion. Must have some religion.”

00:21:40.232 --> 00:21:44.360
So they sent for some people

00:21:44.561 --> 00:21:47.833
and the people who came forward were
Catholics to begin with.

00:21:48.034 --> 00:21:53.361
So the Catholics said, “All right, you can
drink in Catholic religion.”

00:21:53.562 --> 00:21:56.174
I don’t know how they got this idea, but
it’s all right.

00:21:56.375 --> 00:22:02.442
“Catholic religion you can drink but you
cannot have more than one wife.”

00:22:02.643 --> 00:22:04.665
The tzar said, “No, that’s not possible!

00:22:04.866 --> 00:22:07.764
We have to have many tsarinas, you see,
for different purposes.

00:22:07.965 --> 00:22:12.003
So we can’t have that religion!”
So they cancelled it.

00:22:12.204 --> 00:22:16.233
So then the Islam: you see that time
I think they were no hindus available,

00:22:16.434 --> 00:22:18.896
thank God!

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:23.355
They had the Islam, Islam people went,
and the Islamic people said,

00:22:23.556 --> 00:22:27.770
“No, all right, you can have five wives,
it’s all right,

00:22:27.971 --> 00:22:34.168
but you cannot drink.” They said,
“That’s impossible!

00:22:34.369 --> 00:22:39.165
How can we follow Islam? That’s not
possible!” So, cancel it!

00:22:39.366 --> 00:22:42.215
So these orthodox people — orthodox,
you see,

00:22:42.416 --> 00:22:44.822
the word orthodox remember that — they
came.

00:22:45.023 --> 00:22:47.822
They said, “No, we are just in the centre,
you see.

00:22:48.023 --> 00:22:51.262
We don’t mind if you drink,

00:22:51.463 --> 00:22:54.244
we don’t mind if you have many wives,
we don’t mind.

00:22:54.466 --> 00:22:57.118
Only thing is, you have to pay us well!”

00:22:57.319 --> 00:23:01.632
Tzars said, “All right, that’s good, let’s
have this religion!”

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:05.380
And that’s how they had this religion
there.

00:23:05.581 --> 00:23:08.312
So this is the situation of the religion
today.

00:23:08.513 --> 00:23:17.593
All these religions have become sort
of deformed statues, good for nothing.

00:23:17.794 --> 00:23:21.677
So now the inner religion within us is
the Sahaja dharma,

00:23:21.878 --> 00:23:25.871
which has to be fully followed.

00:23:26.072 --> 00:23:30.788
Now, I told, say in India, that now you
are all become Sahajas.

00:23:30.989 --> 00:23:38.180
The story is like this, that there was
a villager who became Christian.

00:23:38.381 --> 00:23:42.896
So he came down to Allahabad to become
Christian.

00:23:43.097 --> 00:23:45.077
So he told them that, “You have to give
me a big name

00:23:45.278 --> 00:23:48.463
because now I am Saheb, you see, I have
become an English man.

00:23:48.664 --> 00:23:51.159
So you better give me a big name.”
They said, “What name you want?”

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.868
He said, “Give me the name of Alexander
the Great!”

00:23:54.069 --> 00:23:57.876
So they called him Alexander. But his name
was Blondie, you see.

00:23:58.077 --> 00:24:04.044
His real Indian name was Bhoora, so they
called him Alexander Bhoora.

00:24:04.244 --> 00:24:07.230
So Mr. Alexander Bhoora came to Allahabad

00:24:07.431 --> 00:24:10.428
and went to the River Ganges for having
his bath.

00:24:10.629 --> 00:24:14.636
So the priest said, the pastor, he said,
“You can’t do that!”

00:24:14.837 --> 00:24:17.102
He said, “Why? Why can’t I do that?”

00:24:17.303 --> 00:24:19.891
He said, “No, you can’t go and have bath
in the River Ganges

00:24:20.092 --> 00:24:22.040
because the Christianity will drop out,
you see!”

00:24:22.241 --> 00:24:25.226
If he goes and has a bath in the River
Ganges.

00:24:25.427 --> 00:24:27.269
He said, “This you can’t do!”

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:31.649
So Alexander Bhoora said, “If I have become
saheb,

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:35.971
I have become an Englishman, that doesn’t
mean I have given up my religion!”

00:24:36.172 --> 00:24:41.050
You see! This is exactly what is happening
to us

00:24:41.251 --> 00:24:44.803
when we try to follow any religion
whatsoever.

00:24:45.004 --> 00:24:50.721
Now we are all identified with our
so-called religions in which we were born.

00:24:50.922 --> 00:24:55.441
For example, if I told Indians, “Now,
you don’t go to temples!

00:24:55.642 --> 00:24:59.581
You are not to go to any temple, even if it
is a swayambhu temple,

00:24:59.782 --> 00:25:04.243
unless and until you have told me, don’t go
to a swayambhu temple at any cost.”

00:25:04.444 --> 00:25:11.772
There are many churches also where there
are very good statues, we can say,

00:25:11.973 --> 00:25:17.170
or have got something which are really
swayambhus, but they are very few.

00:25:17.371 --> 00:25:20.451
So you tell me and then go. But they
wouldn’t listen to me,

00:25:20.652 --> 00:25:25.492
they won’t listen, and when they go there
they catch on their Agnyas.

00:25:25.714 --> 00:25:31.396
Once I went to see one temple which was
of course a swayambhu temple, no doubt,

00:25:31.597 --> 00:25:35.436
so some Sahaj Yogis decided to go there.

00:25:35.637 --> 00:25:37.844
But I didn’t ask them, they didn’t tell
me.

00:25:38.044 --> 00:25:40.683
When they came back, as soon as they
saw me, they all fainted.

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:45.622
I said, “What happened? Where did you go?”
“Oh, we went to this temple.”

00:25:45.823 --> 00:25:48.997
I said, “Why? You never told me. And what
do you have here?”

00:25:49.198 --> 00:25:52.510
You see, the Brahmin put the teeka
(bindi) and it’s finished!

00:25:52.711 --> 00:25:55.259
Then it took them one month to clear out!

00:25:55.460 --> 00:26:00.094
Now they don’t go, they’ve had enough
of it.

00:26:00.295 --> 00:26:03.783
Same with the Christians:

00:26:03.984 --> 00:26:07.290
now the other day I heard about the Paris
episode

00:26:07.491 --> 00:26:14.633
where people wanted to have weddings
in the church, in Paris.

00:26:14.834 --> 00:26:16.837
So they must have special dresses!

00:26:17.038 --> 00:26:22.223
So somebody came here to buy some special
dresses from… what shop is that?

00:26:22.424 --> 00:26:24.639
I forgot the name, some big name.

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:31.188
So the special dresses must be worn because
they have to go to the church!

00:26:31.389 --> 00:26:37.049
And when they came out of the church with
those dresses, they had become bhoots.

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:40.771
I was surprised, what has happened to these
twenty-five of them?

00:26:40.972 --> 00:26:45.542
What has happened is that in the church
there are many dead bodies buried,

00:26:45.743 --> 00:26:47.682
and they are all caught up.

00:26:47.883 --> 00:26:52.670
So when you go also to see the beautiful
architecture,

00:26:52.871 --> 00:26:58.832
go with a detached mind. Don’t think
that you belong to that church.

00:26:59.033 --> 00:27:02.091
You don’t belong to any church. You don’t
belong to any temple.

00:27:02.292 --> 00:27:06.803
Don’t belong to any one of these forms,
then only you will ascend.

00:27:07.004 --> 00:27:13.622
And I have to tell you today that Christ
did not belong to any religion.

00:27:15.945 --> 00:27:22.540
He didn’t follow any religion. He followed
His own spiritual religion.

00:27:22.741 --> 00:27:25.708
When He went to one church where there
were people who were discussing,

00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:30.845
I mean they were Jews, He went there
and He was talking to them.

00:27:31.046 --> 00:27:35.646
The other day I saw a beautiful painting
they had given on the newspaper,

00:27:35.847 --> 00:27:40.660
a very beautiful famous painting where
Christ is talking to the doctors

00:27:40.861 --> 00:27:49.806
and He is holding His, rubbing His Left
Swadhishthana, very nicely,

00:27:50.007 --> 00:27:53.043
and all the doctors, you see, one of them
is listening to Him,

00:27:53.244 --> 00:27:55.537
one of them is looking at Him, sneering
at Him,

00:27:55.738 --> 00:27:57.932
another one is little bit paying attention
to Him.

00:27:58.133 --> 00:28:02.943
He’s just rubbing His Left Swadhishthan.

00:28:03.294 --> 00:28:06.321
It’s clearly [shown]. You can see it
so clearly!

00:28:06.522 --> 00:28:10.755
And so now, with these new achievements,
you must rise above all these things

00:28:10.956 --> 00:28:16.639
and you must understand that we have to be
very independently looking at ourselves.

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:20.778
We are no more belonging to any religion.

00:28:20.979 --> 00:28:26.443
We belong to the religion of God which is
Sahaj.

00:28:26.644 --> 00:28:29.748
And Sahaj is the religion, it will spread

00:28:29.949 --> 00:28:34.284
only when you really become nothing
but Sahaj.

00:28:34.485 --> 00:28:38.018
But that’s something I don’t understand —
it doesn’t work out.

00:28:38.219 --> 00:28:43.694
I met somebody from, I forget that, there
was, say, called

00:28:43.895 --> 00:28:50.613
‘Hamaty’ or something who was supposed
to be an incarnation or something.

00:28:50.814 --> 00:28:55.349
His disciples absolutely, you should say
that they behave in such a manner

00:28:55.550 --> 00:29:01.582
that you can’t believe it, how ardently
they believe in this man.

00:29:01.783 --> 00:29:06.178
Whatever he says, whatever he does,
how they believe in him.

00:29:06.379 --> 00:29:08.201
It’s very surprising.

00:29:08.402 --> 00:29:14.520
You meet anyone who is following any guru,
anyone,

00:29:14.721 --> 00:29:18.861
you’ll be surprised the way they are
fanatic about this fellow

00:29:19.062 --> 00:29:22.278
and they will not hear anything against.
Leave alone that,

00:29:22.479 --> 00:29:27.684
but if he says, “You stand on your head
for the whole night,” they will do it!

00:29:27.906 --> 00:29:32.477
I don’t know what happens: when it comes
to falsehood, we try to follow it,

00:29:32.678 --> 00:29:36.363
and when we know the truth, this is
the truth,

00:29:36.564 --> 00:29:42.482
then we take advantage and we try
to compromise.

00:29:42.683 --> 00:29:48.628
We think the truth will not do anything
about it.

00:29:48.849 --> 00:29:51.756
Not that truth will punish you, it will
not,

00:29:51.957 --> 00:29:55.203
because you are realised souls. It will
not.

00:29:55.404 --> 00:29:58.590
It will not punish you up to a point.

00:29:58.791 --> 00:30:06.096
But remember that Ekadasha is absolutely
working at the same time.

00:30:06.297 --> 00:30:08.234
If we do anything wrong,

00:30:08.435 --> 00:30:12.873
like these people went to the church,
they were all caught up.

00:30:13.286 --> 00:30:16.637
Now they may say that, “Mother, why should
we be caught up?

00:30:16.838 --> 00:30:19.644
We are Sahaj Yogis.”

00:30:19.845 --> 00:30:25.258
Because you are vulnerable, you are
vulnerable.

00:30:25.459 --> 00:30:27.634
Yet you have not reached that stage.

00:30:27.835 --> 00:30:30.821
If you reach that stage, then when you
go there,

00:30:31.022 --> 00:30:35.793
all the church people will come out
of the church and run away.

00:30:35.994 --> 00:30:39.335
They’ll start shaking before you.

00:30:39.536 --> 00:30:41.204
They will not know what has happened.

00:30:41.405 --> 00:30:44.048
I have seen when I enter into any church

00:30:44.249 --> 00:30:47.408
all the candles start going chuk, chuk,
chuk, chuk, chuk, chuk,

00:30:47.609 --> 00:30:50.135
and people start wondering what has
happened.

00:30:50.336 --> 00:30:54.642
Even when they are having a dinner or
something and there is a candlelight dinner

00:30:54.843 --> 00:31:00.471
I am surprised the way every candle starts
flickering and people start looking.

00:31:00.672 --> 00:31:03.245
Because the bhoots are sitting before them,
you see,

00:31:03.446 --> 00:31:08.424
so the candles immediately show that
these are the bhoots sitting here.

00:31:08.625 --> 00:31:13.179
With all this knowledge that you have,
the light you have within yourself,

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.911
by which you are enlightened, still if you
are going

00:31:16.112 --> 00:31:20.628
to these left and right-sided things,
it’s very, very dangerous.

00:31:20.829 --> 00:31:27.783
We see that also, today, I must tell you
about the part that is politics.

00:31:27.984 --> 00:31:31.340
In politics also these people have
developed two types of theories:

00:31:31.541 --> 00:31:33.712
one is left-sided, one right-sided.

00:31:33.913 --> 00:31:36.874
The left-sided theories are democratic,

00:31:37.075 --> 00:31:39.934
where you can indulge into anything
you like.

00:31:40.135 --> 00:31:42.364
It’s the individual that is important.

00:31:42.573 --> 00:31:44.923
The individual indulges into everything

00:31:45.124 --> 00:31:49.355
and you should not stop him from doing
whatever he likes, he’s an individual:

00:31:49.556 --> 00:31:52.525
so he has a right to cut his nose, he has
a right to cut his eyes,

00:31:52.726 --> 00:31:55.695
to do what he likes.

00:31:55.896 --> 00:31:59.636
An individual is allowed to do what
he likes to do,

00:31:59.837 --> 00:32:06.418
and then what happens [is] that we find
this democracy becomes a demonocracy:

00:32:06.619 --> 00:32:11.353
everybody is a demon. Everybody is busy
cutting throats,

00:32:11.554 --> 00:32:17.078
cutting all the basis and the roots of life

00:32:17.279 --> 00:32:21.241
because everybody is Brahma, becomes
a great personality,

00:32:21.442 --> 00:32:26.863
because the individual is so great and
the collective is lost, completely lost.

00:32:27.064 --> 00:32:31.807
But on the other side, where it is more
discipline,

00:32:32.008 --> 00:32:37.010
more aggressiveness, more controls and
everything [with] the Right Side,

00:32:37.211 --> 00:32:42.110
which we can call as communism, where
people are controlled all the time.

00:32:42.311 --> 00:32:47.051
Now why? Because for the collective
the individual must sacrifice.

00:32:47.252 --> 00:32:51.838
In that case, the individuals become weak
and if the individuals are weak,

00:32:52.039 --> 00:32:56.378
then the collective cannot be strong:
it cannot be strong.

00:32:56.579 --> 00:32:59.564
The individuals have to be strong.
For example, you will see

00:32:59.765 --> 00:33:03.693
that the people who come from communist
countries,

00:33:03.894 --> 00:33:07.733
they drink more than people who can
drink here.

00:33:07.934 --> 00:33:12.327
Or those who come, say from Islamic
countries, where they don’t touch anything,

00:33:12.528 --> 00:33:15.422
can drink more than even sardarjees.

00:33:15.623 --> 00:33:20.138
So you can imagine what is the situation
of human beings is

00:33:20.339 --> 00:33:25.440
that, out of fear if you try to control
him, he goes to the Right Side.

00:33:25.641 --> 00:33:29.827
But he is in no way perfected, he’s not
transformed,

00:33:30.028 --> 00:33:35.753
he doesn’t accept the situation, he doesn’t
become that,

00:33:35.954 --> 00:33:40.362
he doesn’t have that power to control
himself.

00:33:40.563 --> 00:33:47.371
He doesn’t get over his sinning aptitudes.
He’s still there.

00:33:47.572 --> 00:33:51.922
As soon as he gets a chance he falls
into it. So that fails.

00:33:52.123 --> 00:33:54.573
So the individuals are weak in that case.

00:33:54.774 --> 00:33:58.628
And where there is complete abandonment,
do what you like,

00:33:58.829 --> 00:34:04.563
live the way you like, indulgences, all
kinds of things, so you find [decadence].

00:34:04.764 --> 00:34:06.946
I mean, everyday you see and you say,

00:34:07.147 --> 00:34:10.313
“Oh God, this is a decadent society,
this is happening!”

00:34:10.514 --> 00:34:15.800
Decadence is because an individual
[to] whom you have given all these powers,

00:34:16.001 --> 00:34:18.885
has no power to bear them.

00:34:19.086 --> 00:34:24.837
An individual cannot bear money. He
cannot bear power of any kind.

00:34:25.038 --> 00:34:30.915
He cannot bear love. He cannot bear
kindness.

00:34:31.116 --> 00:34:37.335
He cannot understand peace because he’s
still an individual.

00:34:37.536 --> 00:34:42.206
But when an individual becomes
the collective -

00:34:42.407 --> 00:34:45.653
this is the ascent through the central
path -

00:34:45.854 --> 00:34:54.639
when he becomes the collective, in his
strength he strengthens the collective.

00:34:54.840 --> 00:35:00.917
And also the collective looks after,
protects, and guides the individual.

00:35:01.118 --> 00:35:02.831
This is what Sahaj Yoga is.

00:35:03.032 --> 00:35:10.107
So the politics of Sahaj Yoga is that you
have to become the collective personality.

00:35:10.356 --> 00:35:16.965
And there where we feel that still we are
something great,

00:35:17.166 --> 00:35:25.450
we are different, we are Indians or we are
from England or from France,

00:35:25.651 --> 00:35:29.239
still if you are identified then you are
not collective.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:35.024
In collective sense we are all one, part
and parcel of one being.

00:35:35.225 --> 00:35:39.619
Then you are really acting as collective
being

00:35:39.833 --> 00:35:42.863
and you are one with the Divine. Where
the Sun is looking after you,

00:35:43.064 --> 00:35:46.360
the Moon is looking after you, the winds
are looking after you;

00:35:46.561 --> 00:35:53.042
all the Mother Earth and all these
elements are working.

00:35:53.243 --> 00:35:58.424
Ether, everything is working for you and
you are so well-protected

00:35:58.625 --> 00:36:05.444
and blessed by the special quality to enjoy
the joy.

00:36:05.645 --> 00:36:08.750
Then you really become sensitive to that
joy,

00:36:08.951 --> 00:36:11.872
when you are one with the whole.

00:36:12.073 --> 00:36:16.723
Like if supposing this finger or this
finger is not one with the whole,

00:36:16.924 --> 00:36:21.030
is numbed out… as it happens in leprosy,
what happens

00:36:21.231 --> 00:36:23.433
that this finger becomes numbed out.

00:36:23.634 --> 00:36:29.414
Even if a rat eats it off we don’t know

00:36:29.615 --> 00:36:34.849
because there is no connection, no nerves
acting, it’s insensitive.

00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:38.877
In the same way if you are not collective

00:36:39.078 --> 00:36:46.185
and not bothered about collective you are
going to be dropped out.

00:36:46.386 --> 00:36:50.152
You are not going to be there to enjoy

00:36:50.353 --> 00:36:56.013
the beauties of your own glory and that
of the collective.

00:36:56.214 --> 00:37:00.047
So one has to understand that we have to be
strong ourselves,

00:37:00.253 --> 00:37:03.966
we have to ascend and we have to be
collective.

00:37:04.167 --> 00:37:07.457
It’s very easy to find out faults with
others.

00:37:07.658 --> 00:37:10.759
Very easy to find faults with the leaders.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:16.026
Very easy to find faults also with Sahaj
Yoga, sometimes with me.

00:37:16.227 --> 00:37:21.421
Better find faults with yourself. The rest
I’ll look after.

00:37:21.622 --> 00:37:26.118
First you just find faults with yourself
and try to understand others

00:37:26.319 --> 00:37:31.352
and love others and enjoy the company
of others.

00:37:31.553 --> 00:37:35.184
This, once you decide that we have
to enjoy,

00:37:35.385 --> 00:37:38.869
I tell you, it’s so spontaneous.

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:42.707
Just this decision, this faith, within you

00:37:42.908 --> 00:37:46.479
that, “I’m going to enjoy now my Spirit.

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:50.583
I’m going to enjoy the collective within
me,” that’s the Spirit.

00:37:50.784 --> 00:37:56.443
Just this decision itself will give you
the power to enjoy.

00:37:56.644 --> 00:38:00.186
But the decision should be firm,
no hypocrisy,

00:38:00.387 --> 00:38:04.262
no playing games, no ego, no conditioning,
nothing,

00:38:04.463 --> 00:38:10.371
just pure desire within us that we have
to be the Spirit.

00:38:10.572 --> 00:38:14.788
And the Spirit which is the collective
being within us.

00:38:14.989 --> 00:38:19.761
I hope today on this day of resurrection,

00:38:19.962 --> 00:38:26.686
we have to be thankful to Christ very much
for showing us the way

00:38:26.887 --> 00:38:37.865
and also we have to be very much concerned
and alerted about ourselves:

00:38:38.066 --> 00:38:40.883
Where are we? Where do we stand?

00:38:41.084 --> 00:38:44.444
What are we up to? What are we doing?

00:38:44.645 --> 00:38:48.385
What is our responsibility? What is
expected of us?

00:38:48.586 --> 00:38:51.475
Why all these blessings are given to us?

00:38:51.676 --> 00:38:55.419
There’s no sacrifice in Sahaj Yoga,
no sacrifice.

00:38:55.620 --> 00:39:00.461
Nobody wants you anything to commit
or to do

00:39:00.662 --> 00:39:03.768
or membership or anything like that.

00:39:03.969 --> 00:39:09.414
I think it’s my commitment. As I said,
that God has the commitment

00:39:09.615 --> 00:39:16.802
but you also have one commitment that
your desire should be pure.

00:39:17.003 --> 00:39:20.864
That’s the only thing, that, “Let my desire
be pure!

00:39:21.065 --> 00:39:24.319
No impurities of any kind, should work it
out.”

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:29.038
As Christ had His desire, so pure, and
that’s what He achieved.

00:39:29.239 --> 00:39:32.360
I am sure you can all achieve a lot in your
life.

00:39:32.561 --> 00:39:37.269
Today is my sixty-fifth birthday. Now
imagine, I’m sixty-five years of age

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:45.622
and at this age most of the ladies, you
see, just, I don’t know what they do.

00:39:46.917 --> 00:39:55.448
So now you must come up and work out
everything

00:39:55.649 --> 00:40:01.374
as far as possible, thinking that we all
have to stand up.

00:40:01.575 --> 00:40:05.823
Now the children are coming up. They are
also going to stand up.

00:40:06.024 --> 00:40:08.295
You are all looking younger to me and
younger to me.

00:40:08.496 --> 00:40:11.796
Every day I see you, you look younger.
Sometimes I don’t even recognise you,

00:40:11.997 --> 00:40:17.894
the way you look younger and I think,
is he the son or is he the father?

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:28.366
So, the situation is such that you are
all blessed:

00:40:28.596 --> 00:40:31.835
you’ve got jobs, you’ve got everything.
And everybody tells me,

00:40:32.036 --> 00:40:34.401
“Mother, this is what has happened,
that has happened!” everything.

00:40:34.602 --> 00:40:39.533
Now, so what? These are temptations,
be careful.

00:40:39.734 --> 00:40:41.823
This is not what you wanted.

00:40:42.024 --> 00:40:48.879
What you wanted is the state of that
complete faith within yourself

00:40:49.085 --> 00:40:54.195
where you don’t have to ask, nothing —
everything will work out.

00:40:54.434 --> 00:40:59.736
Everything will work out. It works!
That’s the point is.

00:40:59.937 --> 00:41:03.900
So, I hope next time when we meet

00:41:04.101 --> 00:41:08.564
I’ll see even younger people than what
I see today

00:41:08.765 --> 00:41:11.602
and I’ll be able to recognise you.

00:41:11.803 --> 00:41:14.812
Christ died at a very, very young age, very
young age.

00:41:15.013 --> 00:41:22.795
He was very young, I must say. But how
much He has done for humanity.

00:41:22.996 --> 00:41:27.008
Nobody could have achieved that much
in that small age as He has done it.

00:41:27.209 --> 00:41:30.136
It’s remarkable! It’s really remarkable!

00:41:30.337 --> 00:41:35.165
That’s what I expect you to follow, His
footsteps in doing remarkable things.

00:41:35.366 --> 00:41:40.154
And let me see all of you, every one of you
have to do something great.

00:41:40.355 --> 00:41:42.982
And today is the day of certain promises.

00:41:43.183 --> 00:41:44.690
May God bless you for that.

00:41:44.891 --> 00:41:50.101
And I thank you very much for this birthday
of mine.
