Sahasrara Puja Evening Talk. Thredbo (Australia) 3 May 1987.

00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:55.521
I hope today’s lecture did not shock you very much.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.801
I had to tell you about it,

00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:03.973
otherwise you would not know your importance,

00:04:04.173 --> 00:04:09.838
your greatness, your responsibilities.

00:04:17.206 --> 00:04:20.546
But I must warn you about the ghost as I told you,

00:04:20.746 --> 00:04:23.077
because a mother has to warn about the ghost

00:04:23.277 --> 00:04:28.652
to frighten the children, that’s important;

00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:35.874
and the ghost is materialism, as I
said, which has become so important.

00:04:36.074 --> 00:04:44.933
Matter always tries to overpower the spirit, all the time.

00:04:46.355 --> 00:04:50.847
All the habits are formed because of the matter.

00:04:51.047 --> 00:04:54.472
Even the habits of drinking, say, habits of taking drugs

00:04:54.672 --> 00:05:03.683
is nothing but these horrible, powerful material things

00:05:03.883 --> 00:05:09.588
which are dead are trying to overpower us.

00:05:12.094 --> 00:05:21.606
The spirit is paramount, it is the highest thing.

00:05:21.806 --> 00:05:25.491
Nothing can reach it.

00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:36.545
It keeps you away from all the skirmishes,

00:05:36.745 --> 00:05:48.454
all the cheap and superficial problems of the world.

00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:56.056
Materialism has grown much more today than ever before.

00:05:56.256 --> 00:05:59.024
It has become very important for people

00:05:59.224 --> 00:06:04.329
to worry about things that they possess.

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:11.673
I find in the West it has grown so subtly and so sophisticatedly

00:06:11.873 --> 00:06:19.619
that it is difficult even to find out
how far we have gone with it.

00:06:20.174 --> 00:06:29.190
It’s like plastic, which can penetrate
into everything and can hold it.

00:06:32.472 --> 00:06:38.470
This materialism has brought us to the cracking point now,

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:43.055
the whole world is bothered about it.

00:06:43.256 --> 00:06:46.999
First of all there are ecological imbalances.

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:52.030
People are watching the trees are dying out,

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:56.723
because factories are being created out of proportion,

00:06:56.923 --> 00:06:59.926
and the factories need all the time something to be fed into them;

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:15.613
and they go on and on and on, creating
things which are not so much necessary.

00:07:15.813 --> 00:07:26.752
As I told you, it’s a play of the evil
forces which is very much collective.

00:07:27.322 --> 00:07:32.466
Say for a factory starts,

00:07:32.666 --> 00:07:37.283
then clothes are made, for example,

00:07:37.484 --> 00:07:48.521
then there’s an entrepreneur who comes
forward to make the clothes to be sold out.

00:07:48.721 --> 00:07:56.688
Now he is the one who changes, he
starts changing the forms of the clothes

00:07:56.888 --> 00:08:02.047
in such a way that every year, new lot comes out of that machine,

00:08:02.247 --> 00:08:05.199
and everybody has pile of clothes in the house,

00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:08.090
they don’t know what to do with it. These are last year’s,

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:13.254
that’s before last year’s, that’s that last year’s,

00:08:13.454 --> 00:08:22.652
of no use, absolutely useless, all made of artificial fiber.

00:08:23.855 --> 00:08:27.796
It is hard to find anything natural in all the Western countries

00:08:27.996 --> 00:08:31.804
wherever I have been, anything that is cotton,

00:08:32.004 --> 00:08:36.429
anything that is pure silk.

00:08:38.219 --> 00:08:41.808
There should be some balance that machines are for us,

00:08:42.008 --> 00:08:45.697
we are not for the machines.

00:08:45.897 --> 00:08:50.791
Then new types of machines are coming out now

00:08:50.991 --> 00:08:57.094
to befool the people,

00:08:57.294 --> 00:09:03.102
to take advantage of their stupidity I should say,

00:09:03.302 --> 00:09:07.746
and change one after another things,

00:09:07.946 --> 00:09:10.707
as creating fashions.

00:09:10.907 --> 00:09:13.598
As I’m told in America,

00:09:13.798 --> 00:09:18.901
every bathroom has a different type of a switch or a handle,

00:09:19.101 --> 00:09:21.455
you don’t know which one to push.

00:09:21.655 --> 00:09:25.566
You push one handle and you might feel you might get

00:09:25.767 --> 00:09:31.394
all the water on top of your head, is a new style.

00:09:33.855 --> 00:09:39.170
Now I’ve seen the bathroom that I have, it’s very interesting.

00:09:41.918 --> 00:09:46.876
You must know horse-riding to get into it.

00:09:50.797 --> 00:09:52.972
And it’s all surrounded by glass,

00:09:53.172 --> 00:09:58.692
I mean anybody would be nervous taking bath in there;

00:09:59.989 --> 00:10:05.114
and there are big, big holes you see, just as handles.

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:08.553
Of course these things will again go back,

00:10:08.753 --> 00:10:12.428
because normalcy works out. Like in our body also,

00:10:12.628 --> 00:10:18.838
if we do anything extreme we come back
to our parasympathetic which balances.

00:10:19.038 --> 00:10:23.862
So the nature brings you back again to the same thing.

00:10:24.062 --> 00:10:26.099
Like they said “have no marriages,”

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.382
then “have marriages with men.”

00:10:28.582 --> 00:10:31.242
Men having marriages with men, women having marriages with women,

00:10:31.442 --> 00:10:34.699
all kinds of nonsensical marriage systems they developed.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.590
So they must have varieties, you see: “How can it be

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.411
that a woman should marry a man?”

00:10:40.611 --> 00:10:43.551
Then an old woman marrying a very young boy,

00:10:43.751 --> 00:10:46.104
or an old man marrying a very little girl,

00:10:46.304 --> 00:10:49.253
all kinds of nonsensical things started.

00:10:49.453 --> 00:10:51.647
Now it’s coming back again.

00:10:51.848 --> 00:10:55.909
We can’t have many wives, we can’t be with many women,

00:10:56.109 --> 00:10:58.265
we have to be married to one woman,

00:10:58.466 --> 00:11:03.390
all those things are coming back, but at what cost?

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:08.969
We have got already a disease which is called as killer’s disease;

00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:11.703
so many problems have been created by this kind

00:11:11.903 --> 00:11:17.735
of movement towards the left or towards the right.

00:11:19.305 --> 00:11:26.398
Before the war started it was more
the movement on the left-hand side.

00:11:26.598 --> 00:11:31.992
All the poets wrote about something imaginary tragic,

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:38.633
like the Greek tragedy. I don’t know
why there should be a tragedy in Greece.

00:11:38.833 --> 00:11:43.656
Itself, Greece itself is a tragedy for every one of us.

00:11:43.856 --> 00:11:46.211
But they created a tragedy.

00:11:46.411 --> 00:11:52.829
I mean, it’s a horrid stuff that they
have created. So everybody is miserable,

00:11:53.029 --> 00:11:55.837
"Les Miserables all of them,

00:11:56.037 --> 00:12:00.657
and French people don’t like Me much because I’m not serious.

00:12:00.857 --> 00:12:03.597
I should not laugh, I should be very serious.

00:12:03.797 --> 00:12:09.386
When talking about God I should be even worse than a dead body,

00:12:09.586 --> 00:12:13.798
otherwise they don’t want to listen to you.

00:12:13.998 --> 00:12:18.111
All kinds of stupidity started that move to the left,

00:12:18.311 --> 00:12:21.384
doing all kinds of perverse things.

00:12:21.584 --> 00:12:24.381
When Mr. Freud came in they said, “That’s a good leader for us.

00:12:24.581 --> 00:12:28.044
Now he’ll give us some more varieties.”

00:12:28.245 --> 00:12:35.133
I was in a very big banquet, sitting
next to the ambassador of Mexico,

00:12:35.333 --> 00:12:38.633
and he told Me that “I’m told You are against Freud completely.”

00:12:38.833 --> 00:12:41.786
“Yes, I am,” I said, “Jung was a sensible man.”

00:12:41.987 --> 00:12:44.980
He said, “What is in Jung? He told us what all these

00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:47.570
our books have told, so what is so great about him

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.015
that he’s told something the same thing?

00:12:50.215 --> 00:12:53.517
But Freud told us something new, so he’s great.”

00:12:53.717 --> 00:12:56.377
I said, “All right. We have never eaten this table,

00:12:56.577 --> 00:13:02.210
should we eat that because it’s a new thing to do?”

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:08.277
Of course it was not very diplomatic.

00:13:12.172 --> 00:13:16.543
Mut I did say because I couldn’t help. This kind of a funny idea:

00:13:16.743 --> 00:13:19.191
“it’s a new idea, let’s have a new idea”,

00:13:19.391 --> 00:13:22.848
any new idea, you just do it.

00:13:23.048 --> 00:13:25.611
Now in, say, in Rome they have a new idea,

00:13:25.812 --> 00:13:29.723
that they should wear all the things with the sequins all over.

00:13:29.923 --> 00:13:32.705
Now the sequins thing you cannot wash much.

00:13:32.905 --> 00:13:35.568
So today they’ll waste all their money on the sequins,

00:13:35.768 --> 00:13:37.845
tomorrow they cannot wash it, they’ll get dirty,

00:13:38.046 --> 00:13:42.556
so they’ll start on something else.

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.551
We have to be normal people as Sahaja yogis,

00:13:46.751 --> 00:13:53.259
to understand that we’ll not allow matter to supersede us.

00:13:55.390 --> 00:14:01.174
Now today just to celebrate the Sahasrara Day in full way,

00:14:01.374 --> 00:14:03.995
I thought of wearing a sari with many chakras.

00:14:04.195 --> 00:14:07.300
It has some symbol, it’s symbolic thing;

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.714
and the starry sky that you see all over,

00:14:10.914 --> 00:14:15.472
to represent that, the blue color.

00:14:16.776 --> 00:14:20.990
Blue color is the sign of depth. It has some symbol.

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:23.855
It’s not without any symbol, without any meaning,

00:14:24.055 --> 00:14:28.175
that you wear anything because some factory is producing

00:14:28.375 --> 00:14:32.714
these things in bulk and they must be sold.

00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:36.432
We should be out of all these things. These things should not touch us,

00:14:36.633 --> 00:14:39.502
these things should not impress us, but we should laugh at them.

00:14:39.703 --> 00:14:42.767
"Oh, there is now a new craze has started another one",

00:14:42.967 --> 00:14:46.422
and now they are looking like scarecrows everywhere, I find.

00:14:46.623 --> 00:14:50.267
I mean, they can be used for that purpose very easily.

00:14:50.467 --> 00:14:54.665
It’s terrible the way things are working out.

00:14:54.865 --> 00:14:58.228
But the worst thing that happens with materialism,

00:14:58.428 --> 00:15:04.921
that your attention becomes very superficial, very superficial.

00:15:05.121 --> 00:15:11.041
You go on watching everything, you read every sign board.

00:15:11.241 --> 00:15:13.702
If you have missed one you’ll turn around, “I’ve missed one,”

00:15:13.903 --> 00:15:19.004
so you must read that. The whole attention is so superficial.

00:15:19.213 --> 00:15:21.804
You are looking at women, women are looking at men,

00:15:22.004 --> 00:15:26.148
men are looking at – I don’t know what they are looking at.

00:15:26.348 --> 00:15:32.633
The attention is so stupid and so
foolish, and I have seen in their eyes

00:15:32.833 --> 00:15:36.523
the bhoots are passing from one to another.

00:15:36.723 --> 00:15:42.132
It’s absolutely evil to put your eyes to such a strain.

00:15:42.332 --> 00:15:48.132
Christ has said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous
eyes.” How many Christians there are who have,

00:15:48.332 --> 00:15:51.691
who haven’t got adulterous eyes?

00:15:51.891 --> 00:15:56.238
So what you find that the whole thing becomes extremely superficial,

00:15:56.438 --> 00:16:01.526
even the religion. All religions have become anti-God,

00:16:01.726 --> 00:16:04.222
these are all anti-God activities.

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:07.534
They have nothing to do with God, they have nothing to do with religion,

00:16:07.734 --> 00:16:11.817
they have nothing to do with dharma as we call it.

00:16:12.018 --> 00:16:17.639
They are making all kinds of advertisements

00:16:17.839 --> 00:16:20.470
that they are very religious, that they believe in God,

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:24.017
that they are doing all good things.

00:16:24.217 --> 00:16:34.541
Christ, who lived under very meager circumstances,

00:16:34.741 --> 00:16:38.057
was born in a manger.

00:16:38.257 --> 00:16:42.786
If you go and see the property of Pope you will be amazed and aghast.

00:16:42.987 --> 00:16:46.252
He has more property than even the tsars had,

00:16:46.452 --> 00:16:51.859
even the great kings of China had.

00:16:52.059 --> 00:16:56.734
And now they are hand-in-glove with mafia,

00:16:56.934 --> 00:17:01.201
still they are heads of the religion.

00:17:01.401 --> 00:17:04.256
Same in India, the way religion is preached

00:17:04.456 --> 00:17:07.279
with all nonsensical things going on.

00:17:07.479 --> 00:17:10.424
There’s no sense in what they are talking; the Hindu religion,

00:17:10.624 --> 00:17:14.611
the Sikh religion, and the Islamic religion is another nonsense.

00:17:14.811 --> 00:17:18.654
It has nothing to do with God, it’s all anti-God activity.

00:17:18.854 --> 00:17:21.060
It just forces people,

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:26.974
it just frightens people and makes them suffer,

00:17:27.174 --> 00:17:34.522
and uses all the property, the wealth that they have.

00:17:34.722 --> 00:17:37.946
What is the interest of a person who is religious

00:17:38.146 --> 00:17:40.899
in the property of other people?

00:17:41.099 --> 00:17:45.052
Why should he be interested in getting the property of another person?

00:17:45.253 --> 00:17:47.743
He should not be. On the contrary he should be happy

00:17:47.943 --> 00:17:50.926
to see that somebody is happy, well-off with his children,

00:17:51.126 --> 00:17:55.543
enjoying a nice happy life.

00:17:55.743 --> 00:17:59.773
But there’s no end to this greed. The greed is so much

00:17:59.973 --> 00:18:04.843
that it’s impossible to call these people religious by any chance,

00:18:05.043 --> 00:18:08.721
and they are the ones who are talking on religion.

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:12.627
Then the other side of it – not only the greed, the lust.

00:18:12.827 --> 00:18:19.005
The lust is so obvious,

00:18:19.205 --> 00:18:22.669
is so vivid

00:18:22.869 --> 00:18:30.020
that one cannot believe that these
people have anything to do with religion.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.423
So it follows with the superficiality,

00:18:33.624 --> 00:18:36.870
once you get materialistic.

00:18:37.071 --> 00:18:42.053
Then materialism also gives you certain ideas

00:18:42.253 --> 00:18:46.318
that you must have legs like this, you must have nose like that,

00:18:46.518 --> 00:18:49.474
you must have eyes like that, you must have body like that,

00:18:49.674 --> 00:18:52.490
so everybody starts working on that.

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:56.627
In America in the morning if you get up, everybody is running on the streets,

00:18:56.828 --> 00:19:02.272
whether old or young. Some people
died of heart attacks on the streets.

00:19:02.473 --> 00:19:06.994
They said now they are having a new craze, what is it called as, jogging.

00:19:07.194 --> 00:19:09.498
And I had an Indian girl with Me,

00:19:09.706 --> 00:19:12.096
and she said – she woke Me up, she said, “Mother, get up, get up!”

00:19:12.296 --> 00:19:14.658
I said, “What has happened?” “Something gone wrong in this place.”

00:19:14.858 --> 00:19:18.912
I said, “Why?” “Everybody is running.”

00:19:19.112 --> 00:19:23.943
I said, “They are jogging.” “No, no, even old people are running.

00:19:24.143 --> 00:19:27.304
How can it be something like that?” I said, “It is, that’s their style.

00:19:27.504 --> 00:19:31.840
You forget it, let Me sleep!”

00:19:36.868 --> 00:19:47.183
Everything should be done in a way
to keep fit and to keep all right,

00:19:47.383 --> 00:19:51.948
but not just to sort of fall into the traps

00:19:52.148 --> 00:19:56.852
of these people who are spreading materialism.

00:20:00.148 --> 00:20:02.827
I told one lady – she was very thin already, and

00:20:03.028 --> 00:20:05.046
I said, “Why are you thinning more?”

00:20:05.247 --> 00:20:08.036
She said, “Because the modern clothes don’t fit you.”

00:20:08.236 --> 00:20:11.333
So I said, “Is it? It’s that according to the modern clothes

00:20:11.533 --> 00:20:14.020
you are going to make your body?” She said, “You have to,

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.538
otherwise how will you wear the dresses?”

00:20:17.738 --> 00:20:20.499
I said, “This is horrid, absolutely horrid”,

00:20:20.699 --> 00:20:24.593
horrid system that they force people to wear the dresses,

00:20:24.793 --> 00:20:29.210
whatever their standards are.

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:38.773
It has killed all the arts, all the
hand-made things, all the real things.

00:20:38.973 --> 00:20:43.664
It has brought everything artificial, everything superficial.

00:20:43.864 --> 00:20:47.898
The attention is so superficial. Just now I was watching a film,

00:20:48.098 --> 00:20:54.000
some sort of an American film: everybody was sick, everybody was mad.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:57.000
I mean, I couldn’t understand how could any human being

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:02.242
behave like this? I have not known people like that Myself,

00:21:02.442 --> 00:21:05.113
but they showed a sick man behaving

00:21:05.314 --> 00:21:09.630
in a very sickly manner, supposed to be a hero.

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:17.716
All these advertisements, all these newspapers, all this media,

00:21:17.916 --> 00:21:23.888
all of them are just here to create sensations in your body,

00:21:24.088 --> 00:21:28.520
some sort of a sensation. It has to be a sensational thing,

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.497
because they think that you have become matter.

00:21:32.697 --> 00:21:39.677
Unless and until you give some shocks to the matter, it won’t move.

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:45.531
And that is what they have brought you to,

00:21:45.731 --> 00:21:52.293
that’s where we have landed into – a state of matter.

00:21:52.493 --> 00:21:56.191
So we have no feelings, we just don’t talk to anyone,

00:21:56.391 --> 00:22:01.032
our hearts are frozen. We feel afraid to talk to human beings.

00:22:01.232 --> 00:22:05.189
We cannot tolerate our children.

00:22:05.389 --> 00:22:08.311
In London in every, every week

00:22:08.511 --> 00:22:11.288
– in London city, not I am saying England –

00:22:11.488 --> 00:22:15.616
they are killing two children every week.

00:22:15.816 --> 00:22:21.053
We have no love for our children, we can’t bear our children.

00:22:21.253 --> 00:22:25.655
We have no love for each other, no love for cooking,

00:22:25.855 --> 00:22:28.462
no love for doing something for your husband,

00:22:28.662 --> 00:22:31.392
husband has no love for doing anything for the wife.

00:22:31.592 --> 00:22:34.962
All the time what pictures they show is husband and wife fighting,

00:22:35.162 --> 00:22:41.461
all the time – how can there be? There’s no
love, there’s no affection, there’s no kindness.

00:22:41.661 --> 00:22:45.430
What is the fight going on? “Why did you spoil the carpet?”

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:48.434
She said, “No, I didn’t spoil the carpet, the children spoilt it.”

00:22:48.634 --> 00:22:51.438
“Then why didn’t you clean it?” The fight is on –

00:22:51.638 --> 00:22:55.634
for what, for the carpet? What is this carpet?

00:22:55.834 --> 00:22:58.587
Is it a permanent stuff? But what is important,

00:22:58.787 --> 00:23:01.540
they have to sell the house tomorrow. They have to sell the house,

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:05.019
the carpet must be neat, so everything is sellable,

00:23:05.219 --> 00:23:10.042
everything has to be sold, even the wife, husband, children, everything.

00:23:10.242 --> 00:23:13.007
They have to be made in such a way they are sellable all the time.

00:23:13.208 --> 00:23:15.722
Whatever you buy: you buy a diamond – all right,

00:23:15.922 --> 00:23:20.995
it should be sellable. If you want to buy anything precious

00:23:21.195 --> 00:23:24.988
it must be sellable, you’ll be surprised.

00:23:25.188 --> 00:23:28.527
So nobody can have something that is not standardized.

00:23:28.727 --> 00:23:31.948
All the rest, I don’t know, goes into waste I think in these countries.

00:23:32.148 --> 00:23:34.297
You have to have everything standardized.

00:23:34.497 --> 00:23:37.844
Nothing you can have for your own joy, for your own happiness,

00:23:38.044 --> 00:23:45.104
for your own using, for your own love for it.

00:23:45.304 --> 00:23:47.925
You give somebody some present, say for example

00:23:48.125 --> 00:23:51.972
you give somebody a gold ring, immediately that person will go

00:23:52.172 --> 00:24:01.524
to the shopkeeper and ask the jeweler: "Is it gold or not?"

00:24:01.724 --> 00:24:06.448
Whether it is, the price is all right or not,

00:24:06.648 --> 00:24:12.581
what carat gold – everything. They will
not see to the beauty of the thing.

00:24:12.781 --> 00:24:19.714
They will not see to the way the feelings are being expressed.

00:24:19.914 --> 00:24:23.370
What they will see is whether it is sellable or not.

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:27.860
“Later on if I want to sell it, even the presents,

00:24:28.061 --> 00:24:32.096
if I can sell it it’s better to find out.”

00:24:32.296 --> 00:24:37.429
So the whole attitude towards life is that

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:44.031
everything is valued in money, everything is valued in money.

00:24:44.231 --> 00:24:48.007
“What is the damage? How much it will cost?

00:24:48.207 --> 00:24:53.314
How much we have to pay? How much for the child-bearing?

00:24:53.514 --> 00:24:56.603
If you will have one child, how much it will cost?”

00:24:56.803 --> 00:25:02.912
Immediately they’ll go to the computer and find out how much it will cost.

00:25:07.169 --> 00:25:10.775
Now, like I’m speaking so I should find out

00:25:10.975 --> 00:25:14.462
how much it will cost My throat,

00:25:14.662 --> 00:25:18.908
that if I’m speaking so many words, like there’s a computer for it.

00:25:19.108 --> 00:25:21.642
You put in the computer, you’ll find out it will cost you

00:25:21.842 --> 00:25:28.363
five lozenges. All right, charge five lozenges to the Sahaja Yogis.

00:25:35.941 --> 00:25:41.340
There’s no feeling. Even they sing, when they walk,

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.223
even when they do any work there’s no feeling

00:25:44.423 --> 00:25:46.532
and there’s no involvement at all,

00:25:46.733 --> 00:25:50.099
no involvement of any kind.

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:55.991
The artistic work that was done before cannot be done today, why?

00:25:56.191 --> 00:26:00.340
It is because there is no feeling, there’s no involvement,

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:06.721
there’s no feeling that, that "this is my work, I’m doing it;

00:26:06.921 --> 00:26:11.397
I’m doing it to present my own feelings,

00:26:11.598 --> 00:26:18.227
to express myself, it’s my own thing". There’s no feeling.

00:26:18.427 --> 00:26:24.117
Imagine, you have seen, so many of you have seen now Ajanta.

00:26:24.317 --> 00:26:29.649
This was built in ten centuries, cut from top to bottom.

00:26:29.849 --> 00:26:32.845
How they must have planned it? How they must have organized

00:26:33.045 --> 00:26:35.438
among themselves in ten generations?

00:26:35.638 --> 00:26:39.344
How they must have painted it? And there’s nothing,

00:26:39.544 --> 00:26:45.133
no city, nothing, no television, no food. How they lived there?

00:26:45.333 --> 00:26:52.725
They lived on dedication and love of Buddha, whom they had never seen.

00:26:53.662 --> 00:26:59.025
Such personalities they were, such involvement.

00:26:59.225 --> 00:27:06.080
Once they took up something they were absolutely dedicated with it.

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:09.913
But such people are lost today because of materialism.

00:27:10.113 --> 00:27:13.515
Most important thing is how much money you get out of everything,

00:27:13.715 --> 00:27:19.023
there’s no end to it. And then what you take to is thieving.

00:27:19.223 --> 00:27:22.273
All these big, big people, the prime minister,

00:27:22.473 --> 00:27:27.398
today I was told that this Marcos, the great prime minister,

00:27:27.598 --> 00:27:35.473
Filipino fellow gave all his paintings to another thief from Riyad.

00:27:35.673 --> 00:27:37.716
They’re all thieves.

00:27:37.916 --> 00:27:43.624
All these big, big johnnies supposed to be there are thieves.

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:50.556
Why? What are they lacking? What are they afraid of? Why do they do that?

00:27:50.757 --> 00:27:54.247
They are afraid that they’ll be
found out that they are thieves,

00:27:54.447 --> 00:27:56.990
so they are doing all these wrong things.

00:27:57.190 --> 00:28:00.458
They are collecting money because they know they have to run away one day.

00:28:00.658 --> 00:28:04.401
All right, so they must organize in such a way

00:28:04.602 --> 00:28:07.466
that they should have all these things planted in some place

00:28:07.666 --> 00:28:11.310
where they can always get hold of.

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:14.013
But why become the thief first of all?

00:28:14.213 --> 00:28:17.368
You become the prime minister, make a name out of yourself,

00:28:17.568 --> 00:28:22.720
your history will remember you. No,
they cannot think of those things,

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.927
they just think of the present.

00:28:27.286 --> 00:28:31.117
Sahaj way! It’s to make money.

00:28:31.317 --> 00:28:36.039
"When you are on the throne, make the money as much as is possible."

00:28:36.239 --> 00:28:39.427
This money is going to bring them bad name.

00:28:39.627 --> 00:28:42.443
In the progeny they will not be remembered,

00:28:42.643 --> 00:28:45.576
people will not take their names. If they take their names,

00:28:45.776 --> 00:28:50.836
they will have a headache. So what’s
the use of leading such a life?

00:28:51.036 --> 00:28:56.908
Even today human beings in general are not so degenerated

00:28:57.108 --> 00:29:00.721
that they put statues of a drunkard

00:29:00.921 --> 00:29:04.666
or statues of a man who has been a thief,

00:29:04.866 --> 00:29:10.824
who has been managing the whole country
and selling it off to somebody else.

00:29:11.024 --> 00:29:16.785
There are no statues of such people. Nobody remembers them.

00:29:16.985 --> 00:29:22.787
People don’t like them, such people are hated.

00:29:25.772 --> 00:29:29.747
And even if there are statues of such people – I’ve seen that of Stalin –

00:29:29.947 --> 00:29:34.392
they remove them.

00:29:38.032 --> 00:29:44.644
So this idea of materialism has grown like a ghost now

00:29:44.844 --> 00:29:50.681
into the minds of people, that matter is more important;

00:29:50.881 --> 00:29:56.779
that materially if you are all right, you are all right.

00:29:57.465 --> 00:30:04.711
The other side of it is that you must
show that you don’t care for matter,

00:30:04.911 --> 00:30:08.982
that you are not bothered, like these anti-culture people.

00:30:09.182 --> 00:30:13.951
But no, materialism is within them, it is engrained in them,

00:30:14.151 --> 00:30:18.536
it’s in their blood, they can’t get out of it.

00:30:18.736 --> 00:30:22.614
By showing off that "we make our hair in such a manner

00:30:22.814 --> 00:30:26.341
that we don’t need a barber",

00:30:26.541 --> 00:30:31.367
or else "we dress up with dirty clothes with holes in it

00:30:31.567 --> 00:30:36.539
to show that we don’t care for matter", it’s not so.

00:30:36.739 --> 00:30:42.311
By changing the matter you do not change the inside within yourself.

00:30:42.511 --> 00:30:48.495
Inside is changed when you look at the matter as a witness.

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:54.790
Matter has a purpose. You should
know the purpose of the matter.

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:58.815
If you know the purpose of the matter then you have value,

00:30:59.015 --> 00:31:03.011
your value system is correct. For example, this has its own purpose:

00:31:03.211 --> 00:31:08.511
it has a purpose that it must deliver the lecture properly.

00:31:08.711 --> 00:31:12.624
But if this purpose is not served, it is no good.

00:31:12.824 --> 00:31:15.734
In the same way everything has a purpose.

00:31:15.934 --> 00:31:21.961
What’s the use of buying fifty artificial blouses,

00:31:22.161 --> 00:31:29.913
or thirty-two thousand shoes as this lady had, Mrs. Marcos,

00:31:30.113 --> 00:31:34.397
when she’s not going to use even two out of them?

00:31:34.597 --> 00:31:38.295
It has no feeling, it has no meaning, it’s selfishness,

00:31:38.495 --> 00:31:44.704
it’s self-centeredness. It’s thinking about yourself all the time.

00:31:46.533 --> 00:31:49.779
Now you want to give Me a sari.

00:31:49.979 --> 00:31:52.834
In Marathi it is called as “pot zakaych,”

00:31:53.034 --> 00:31:58.865
means they’re covering the womb of the
Goddess, the stomach of the Mother.

00:31:59.065 --> 00:32:03.047
Because She’s put us there, She has given us birth,

00:32:03.247 --> 00:32:06.649
so we must give Her something to cover it,

00:32:06.849 --> 00:32:10.182
is a very humble way of saying it.

00:32:10.382 --> 00:32:13.791
Now you give Me a sari,

00:32:13.991 --> 00:32:18.158
I don’t know when I’m going to wear all these, but whatever it is,

00:32:18.358 --> 00:32:21.374
just give Me a sari with a feeling,

00:32:21.574 --> 00:32:26.983
and maybe I may never wear it, I may wear it also.

00:32:27.183 --> 00:32:32.516
But the progeny will see what you have given to your Mother.

00:32:32.717 --> 00:32:36.402
I’m not going to carry it with Me, nobody’s going to carry the matter with them.

00:32:36.602 --> 00:32:42.264
But it had a purpose, it had a
meaning, it had emotions behind it.

00:32:42.464 --> 00:32:46.545
It was given in a puja when so many people gathered,

00:32:46.745 --> 00:32:51.006
you gave to your Mother. When people
will see it they’ll be so very happy,

00:32:51.206 --> 00:32:54.092
“Oh, the Sydney people gave this,”

00:32:54.292 --> 00:32:58.217
or “the Australians gave on this Sahasrara Day.”

00:32:58.417 --> 00:33:02.257
See, even the vibrations flow.

00:33:02.457 --> 00:33:05.163
Just that, this is what it is.

00:33:05.363 --> 00:33:12.746
Now, it has no purpose if you put something up

00:33:12.946 --> 00:33:17.606
in a puja which is not necessary.

00:33:17.806 --> 00:33:21.369
It has no purpose at all, it has no feeling,

00:33:21.569 --> 00:33:24.408
it has no meaning. It is valueless.

00:33:24.608 --> 00:33:31.755
For example if you put this up, say, into My bathroom, it is useless.

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:37.784
Specially this one,

00:33:37.984 --> 00:33:43.304
because I can’t even sing there.

00:33:45.163 --> 00:33:49.956
Quite frightening. Thank God it’s being screened

00:33:50.156 --> 00:33:53.796
by Sahaja yogis because they know My conditions, you see,

00:33:53.996 --> 00:33:57.734
but it’s so sweet to see the way they have covered it,

00:33:57.934 --> 00:33:59.952
because they know their Mother would be quite nervous

00:34:00.152 --> 00:34:05.818
to have a bath in a glass bathroom.

00:34:06.018 --> 00:34:09.498
That’s all. That shows, you see, that feeling,

00:34:09.698 --> 00:34:13.689
that understanding about Me. That fills My heart

00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:21.146
with such love, such oneness with you
that you understand Me,

00:34:21.347 --> 00:34:25.395
that "Mother may not like, you see, this kind of a glass business."

00:34:25.595 --> 00:34:29.684
It’s so sweet to do those things for Me.

00:34:29.884 --> 00:34:33.567
Little, little things here and there, whatever we do for others

00:34:33.767 --> 00:34:39.606
are so suggestive of our love, of our feelings.

00:34:39.806 --> 00:34:45.103
And this is what you have to express today, not the materialism.

00:34:46.501 --> 00:34:51.860
We don’t have to express that, that we were very rich people

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:56.767
or that we had lots of diamonds and we had ornaments, nothing.

00:34:56.967 --> 00:35:02.001
That is not needed. No, we were people of great feelings.

00:35:02.201 --> 00:35:09.742
What they brought for Christ was leaves of palm, palm tree;

00:35:09.942 --> 00:35:16.281
singing “Hosanna, hosanna!” like the way you were singing today.

00:35:16.481 --> 00:35:20.223
What these palm trees are? Even today they are remembered.

00:35:20.423 --> 00:35:30.713
They’ll be remembered eternally, the
palm trees that were used for this.

00:35:31.658 --> 00:35:36.779
They didn’t think about it, they
didn’t know what to get at that time.

00:35:36.979 --> 00:35:39.474
Whatever was available they got it,

00:35:39.674 --> 00:35:44.046
and started singing “Hosanna, hosanna!” to Christ.

00:35:44.246 --> 00:35:48.405
All these little, little things become so important,

00:35:48.605 --> 00:35:52.016
because you have given value to it.

00:35:52.216 --> 00:36:02.346
A little piece, a little clay if you take and put art into it,

00:36:02.546 --> 00:36:06.198
put your feelings into it, then that becomes expensive.

00:36:06.398 --> 00:36:12.194
Even economics can show that it has become more expensive.

00:36:12.394 --> 00:36:20.436
But if you give with feelings and if
you give it to someone with your love,

00:36:20.636 --> 00:36:30.128
even that adds to the value; to that person it’s very valuable.

00:36:36.432 --> 00:36:43.102
It is remarkable sometimes how little things

00:36:43.302 --> 00:36:48.071
just move the whole ocean of My love

00:36:48.271 --> 00:36:54.551
into a turbulent, happy, joyous, loving heart.

00:36:54.751 --> 00:36:59.426
I sometimes feel that how these little things that they do

00:36:59.626 --> 00:37:04.019
and care for Me, express their love,

00:37:04.219 --> 00:37:11.024
just moves Me to the highest point of joy.

00:37:13.057 --> 00:37:17.646
Then it’s not the matter that is important,

00:37:17.846 --> 00:37:21.805
it’s not how much you have spent is important,

00:37:22.005 --> 00:37:27.212
it’s not how it has been brought is important.

00:37:27.412 --> 00:37:31.501
What is important is how much thought you have given to it;

00:37:31.701 --> 00:37:36.626
and that is what is lacking, that there is no thought.

00:37:36.826 --> 00:37:41.522
We think, but we do not give thought – it’s two things,

00:37:41.722 --> 00:37:45.557
different. We just go on thinking, thinking, doing nothing.

00:37:45.758 --> 00:37:51.897
And to give a thought to a thing
is a sign of depth and understanding.

00:37:52.097 --> 00:37:58.014
When the matter is given thought, then it becomes important.

00:37:58.214 --> 00:38:03.035
Without the thought it is useless, it is sellable all the time,

00:38:03.235 --> 00:38:07.106
everything is sellable.

00:38:07.306 --> 00:38:10.902
It has no meaning, it has no value.

00:38:11.102 --> 00:38:14.720
I hope you will all get out of this ghost,

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:21.049
and get out of the clutches of these
entrepreneurs who are trying to ruin you.

00:38:21.249 --> 00:38:28.429
Try to have things which are full of feelings,

00:38:28.629 --> 00:38:32.958
which are having some meaning,

00:38:33.158 --> 00:38:41.099
and also try to give it to others things which can express your love.

00:38:41.299 --> 00:38:48.403
Matter has one great value, that through
matter you can express your love,

00:38:48.603 --> 00:38:52.948
you can express your feelings for a person.

00:38:53.148 --> 00:38:58.152
Now today at the last minute I was just struggling to get

00:38:58.352 --> 00:39:00.972
some presents for you;

00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:05.220
I mean, it was such a struggle, you can’t imagine.

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:09.580
I was in a big mess there,

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:13.982
the house was in a mess and all kinds of things happening,

00:39:14.182 --> 00:39:16.951
the puja in the morning.

00:39:17.151 --> 00:39:21.639
Until about twelve o’clock I could not leave Pune.

00:39:21.839 --> 00:39:24.600
So there was no question of buying anything in Bombay.

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:27.421
So I had to do in a very short time

00:39:27.621 --> 00:39:33.852
through other people’s help some sort of purchases,

00:39:34.052 --> 00:39:36.914
and I’ve been able to buy some few things for you,

00:39:37.114 --> 00:39:41.797
so please accept them as a token of My love for you.

00:39:41.997 --> 00:39:45.978
Moreover I’ve brought some mangoes, quite a lot of them,

00:39:46.178 --> 00:39:52.009
and this your custom authorities have taken them away.

00:39:52.209 --> 00:39:54.325
I was very unhappy and they could see that.

00:39:54.525 --> 00:39:56.919
I said, “What’s this, are you going to eat these mangoes?”

00:39:57.119 --> 00:39:59.181
They said, “No, we are going to fumigate.”

00:39:59.382 --> 00:40:01.512
I said, “After fumigation you give it to us,

00:40:01.713 --> 00:40:06.168
for My children I’ve brought.” So they understood it and they agreed.

00:40:06.369 --> 00:40:09.640
So I hope we get the mangoes for you on Monday.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:13.017
After all it’s a small thing, but after all

00:40:13.217 --> 00:40:18.778
this is the time for you to eat mangoes.

00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:33.200
Have you got the presents here? ….

00:40:50.782 --> 00:40:56.527
So I have left it to James’ wisdom to name them for people

00:40:56.727 --> 00:40:59.597
whom he wanted to give the presents,

00:40:59.797 --> 00:41:04.975
and we have smuggled them nicely into your country.

00:41:05.175 --> 00:41:12.866
Because we had a mango problem, they allowed us to bring the rest of it!
