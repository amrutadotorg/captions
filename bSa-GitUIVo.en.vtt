03:42.320 --> 03:49.240
Sahasrara Puja Evening Talk. Thredbo (Australia) 3 May 1987.

03:49.631 --> 03:55.521
I hope today’s lecture did not shock you very much.

03:57.740 --> 04:00.801
I had to tell you about it,

04:01.001 --> 04:03.973
otherwise you would not know your importance,

04:04.173 --> 04:09.838
your greatness, your responsibilities.

04:17.206 --> 04:20.546
But I must warn you about the ghost as I told you,

04:20.746 --> 04:23.077
because a mother has to warn about the ghost

04:23.277 --> 04:28.652
to frighten the children, that’s important;

04:29.401 --> 04:35.874
and the ghost is materialism, as I
said, which has become so important.

04:36.074 --> 04:44.933
Matter always tries to overpower the spirit, all the time.

04:46.355 --> 04:50.847
All the habits are formed because of the matter.

04:51.047 --> 04:54.472
Even the habits of drinking, say, habits of taking drugs

04:54.672 --> 05:03.683
is nothing but these horrible, powerful material things

05:03.883 --> 05:09.588
which are dead are trying to overpower us.

05:12.094 --> 05:21.606
The spirit is paramount, it is the highest thing.

05:21.806 --> 05:25.491
Nothing can reach it.

05:25.691 --> 05:36.545
It keeps you away from all the skirmishes,

05:36.745 --> 05:48.454
all the cheap and superficial problems of the world.

05:50.321 --> 05:56.056
Materialism has grown much more today than ever before.

05:56.256 --> 05:59.024
It has become very important for people

05:59.224 --> 06:04.329
to worry about things that they possess.

06:04.529 --> 06:11.673
I find in the West it has grown so subtly and so sophisticatedly

06:11.873 --> 06:19.619
that it is difficult even to find out
how far we have gone with it.

06:20.174 --> 06:29.190
It’s like plastic, which can penetrate
into everything and can hold it.

06:32.472 --> 06:38.470
This materialism has brought us to the cracking point now,

06:38.670 --> 06:43.055
the whole world is bothered about it.

06:43.256 --> 06:46.999
First of all there are ecological imbalances.

06:47.199 --> 06:52.030
People are watching the trees are dying out,

06:52.230 --> 06:56.723
because factories are being created out of proportion,

06:56.923 --> 06:59.926
and the factories need all the time something to be fed into them;

07:05.889 --> 07:15.613
and they go on and on and on, creating
things which are not so much necessary.

07:15.813 --> 07:26.752
As I told you, it’s a play of the evil
forces which is very much collective.

07:27.322 --> 07:32.466
Say for a factory starts,

07:32.666 --> 07:37.283
then clothes are made, for example,

07:37.484 --> 07:48.521
then there’s an entrepreneur who comes
forward to make the clothes to be sold out.

07:48.721 --> 07:56.688
Now he is the one who changes, he
starts changing the forms of the clothes

07:56.888 --> 08:02.047
in such a way that every year, new lot comes out of that machine,

08:02.247 --> 08:05.199
and everybody has pile of clothes in the house,

08:05.399 --> 08:08.090
they don’t know what to do with it. These are last year’s,

08:08.290 --> 08:13.254
that’s before last year’s, that’s that last year’s,

08:13.454 --> 08:22.652
of no use, absolutely useless, all made of artificial fiber.

08:23.855 --> 08:27.796
It is hard to find anything natural in all the Western countries

08:27.996 --> 08:31.804
wherever I have been, anything that is cotton,

08:32.004 --> 08:36.429
anything that is pure silk.

08:38.219 --> 08:41.808
There should be some balance that machines are for us,

08:42.008 --> 08:45.697
we are not for the machines.

08:45.897 --> 08:50.791
Then new types of machines are coming out now

08:50.991 --> 08:57.094
to befool the people,

08:57.294 --> 09:03.102
to take advantage of their stupidity I should say,

09:03.302 --> 09:07.746
and change one after another things,

09:07.946 --> 09:10.707
as creating fashions.

09:10.907 --> 09:13.598
As I’m told in America,

09:13.798 --> 09:18.901
every bathroom has a different type of a switch or a handle,

09:19.101 --> 09:21.455
you don’t know which one to push.

09:21.655 --> 09:25.566
You push one handle and you might feel you might get

09:25.767 --> 09:31.394
all the water on top of your head, is a new style.

09:33.855 --> 09:39.170
Now I’ve seen the bathroom that I have, it’s very interesting.

09:41.918 --> 09:46.876
You must know horse-riding to get into it.

09:50.797 --> 09:52.972
And it’s all surrounded by glass,

09:53.172 --> 09:58.692
I mean anybody would be nervous taking bath in there;

09:59.989 --> 10:05.114
and there are big, big holes you see, just as handles.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.553
Of course these things will again go back,

10:08.753 --> 10:12.428
because normalcy works out. Like in our body also,

10:12.628 --> 10:18.838
if we do anything extreme we come back
to our parasympathetic which balances.

10:19.038 --> 10:23.862
So the nature brings you back again to the same thing.

10:24.062 --> 10:26.099
Like they said “have no marriages,”

10:26.300 --> 10:28.382
then “have marriages with men.”

10:28.582 --> 10:31.242
Men having marriages with men, women having marriages with women,

10:31.442 --> 10:34.699
all kinds of nonsensical marriage systems they developed.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.590
So they must have varieties, you see: “How can it be

10:37.790 --> 10:40.411
that a woman should marry a man?”

10:40.611 --> 10:43.551
Then an old woman marrying a very young boy,

10:43.751 --> 10:46.104
or an old man marrying a very little girl,

10:46.304 --> 10:49.253
all kinds of nonsensical things started.

10:49.453 --> 10:51.647
Now it’s coming back again.

10:51.848 --> 10:55.909
We can’t have many wives, we can’t be with many women,

10:56.109 --> 10:58.265
we have to be married to one woman,

10:58.466 --> 11:03.390
all those things are coming back, but at what cost?

11:04.570 --> 11:08.969
We have got already a disease which is called as killer’s disease;

11:09.169 --> 11:11.703
so many problems have been created by this kind

11:11.903 --> 11:17.735
of movement towards the left or towards the right.

11:19.305 --> 11:26.398
Before the war started it was more
the movement on the left-hand side.

11:26.598 --> 11:31.992
All the poets wrote about something imaginary tragic,

11:32.192 --> 11:38.633
like the Greek tragedy. I don’t know
why there should be a tragedy in Greece.

11:38.833 --> 11:43.656
Itself, Greece itself is a tragedy for every one of us.

11:43.856 --> 11:46.211
But they created a tragedy.

11:46.411 --> 11:52.829
I mean, it’s a horrid stuff that they
have created. So everybody is miserable,

11:53.029 --> 11:55.837
"Les Miserables all of them,

11:56.037 --> 12:00.657
and French people don’t like Me much because I’m not serious.

12:00.857 --> 12:03.597
I should not laugh, I should be very serious.

12:03.797 --> 12:09.386
When talking about God I should be even worse than a dead body,

12:09.586 --> 12:13.798
otherwise they don’t want to listen to you.

12:13.998 --> 12:18.111
All kinds of stupidity started that move to the left,

12:18.311 --> 12:21.384
doing all kinds of perverse things.

12:21.584 --> 12:24.381
When Mr. Freud came in they said, “That’s a good leader for us.

12:24.581 --> 12:28.044
Now he’ll give us some more varieties.”

12:28.245 --> 12:35.133
I was in a very big banquet, sitting
next to the ambassador of Mexico,

12:35.333 --> 12:38.633
and he told Me that “I’m told You are against Freud completely.”

12:38.833 --> 12:41.786
“Yes, I am,” I said, “Jung was a sensible man.”

12:41.987 --> 12:44.980
He said, “What is in Jung? He told us what all these

12:45.181 --> 12:47.570
our books have told, so what is so great about him

12:47.770 --> 12:50.015
that he’s told something the same thing?

12:50.215 --> 12:53.517
But Freud told us something new, so he’s great.”

12:53.717 --> 12:56.377
I said, “All right. We have never eaten this table,

12:56.577 --> 13:02.210
should we eat that because it’s a new thing to do?”

13:02.410 --> 13:08.277
Of course it was not very diplomatic.

13:12.172 --> 13:16.543
Mut I did say because I couldn’t help. This kind of a funny idea:

13:16.743 --> 13:19.191
“it’s a new idea, let’s have a new idea”,

13:19.391 --> 13:22.848
any new idea, you just do it.

13:23.048 --> 13:25.611
Now in, say, in Rome they have a new idea,

13:25.812 --> 13:29.723
that they should wear all the things with the sequins all over.

13:29.923 --> 13:32.705
Now the sequins thing you cannot wash much.

13:32.905 --> 13:35.568
So today they’ll waste all their money on the sequins,

13:35.768 --> 13:37.845
tomorrow they cannot wash it, they’ll get dirty,

13:38.046 --> 13:42.556
so they’ll start on something else.

13:44.220 --> 13:46.551
We have to be normal people as Sahaja yogis,

13:46.751 --> 13:53.259
to understand that we’ll not allow matter to supersede us.

13:55.390 --> 14:01.174
Now today just to celebrate the Sahasrara Day in full way,

14:01.374 --> 14:03.995
I thought of wearing a sari with many chakras.

14:04.195 --> 14:07.300
It has some symbol, it’s symbolic thing;

14:07.500 --> 14:10.714
and the starry sky that you see all over,

14:10.914 --> 14:15.472
to represent that, the blue color.

14:16.776 --> 14:20.990
Blue color is the sign of depth. It has some symbol.

14:21.190 --> 14:23.855
It’s not without any symbol, without any meaning,

14:24.055 --> 14:28.175
that you wear anything because some factory is producing

14:28.375 --> 14:32.714
these things in bulk and they must be sold.

14:32.914 --> 14:36.432
We should be out of all these things. These things should not touch us,

14:36.633 --> 14:39.502
these things should not impress us, but we should laugh at them.

14:39.703 --> 14:42.767
"Oh, there is now a new craze has started another one",

14:42.967 --> 14:46.422
and now they are looking like scarecrows everywhere, I find.

14:46.623 --> 14:50.267
I mean, they can be used for that purpose very easily.

14:50.467 --> 14:54.665
It’s terrible the way things are working out.

14:54.865 --> 14:58.228
But the worst thing that happens with materialism,

14:58.428 --> 15:04.921
that your attention becomes very superficial, very superficial.

15:05.121 --> 15:11.041
You go on watching everything, you read every sign board.

15:11.241 --> 15:13.702
If you have missed one you’ll turn around, “I’ve missed one,”

15:13.903 --> 15:19.004
so you must read that. The whole attention is so superficial.

15:19.213 --> 15:21.804
You are looking at women, women are looking at men,

15:22.004 --> 15:26.148
men are looking at – I don’t know what they are looking at.

15:26.348 --> 15:32.633
The attention is so stupid and so
foolish, and I have seen in their eyes

15:32.833 --> 15:36.523
the bhoots are passing from one to another.

15:36.723 --> 15:42.132
It’s absolutely evil to put your eyes to such a strain.

15:42.332 --> 15:48.132
Christ has said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous
eyes.” How many Christians there are who have,

15:48.332 --> 15:51.691
who haven’t got adulterous eyes?

15:51.891 --> 15:56.238
So what you find that the whole thing becomes extremely superficial,

15:56.438 --> 16:01.526
even the religion. All religions have become anti-God,

16:01.726 --> 16:04.222
these are all anti-God activities.

16:04.422 --> 16:07.534
They have nothing to do with God, they have nothing to do with religion,

16:07.734 --> 16:11.817
they have nothing to do with dharma as we call it.

16:12.018 --> 16:17.639
They are making all kinds of advertisements

16:17.839 --> 16:20.470
that they are very religious, that they believe in God,

16:20.670 --> 16:24.017
that they are doing all good things.

16:24.217 --> 16:34.541
Christ, who lived under very meager circumstances,

16:34.741 --> 16:38.057
was born in a manger.

16:38.257 --> 16:42.786
If you go and see the property of Pope you will be amazed and aghast.

16:42.987 --> 16:46.252
He has more property than even the tsars had,

16:46.452 --> 16:51.859
even the great kings of China had.

16:52.059 --> 16:56.734
And now they are hand-in-glove with mafia,

16:56.934 --> 17:01.201
still they are heads of the religion.

17:01.401 --> 17:04.256
Same in India, the way religion is preached

17:04.456 --> 17:07.279
with all nonsensical things going on.

17:07.479 --> 17:10.424
There’s no sense in what they are talking; the Hindu religion,

17:10.624 --> 17:14.611
the Sikh religion, and the Islamic religion is another nonsense.

17:14.811 --> 17:18.654
It has nothing to do with God, it’s all anti-God activity.

17:18.854 --> 17:21.060
It just forces people,

17:21.260 --> 17:26.974
it just frightens people and makes them suffer,

17:27.174 --> 17:34.522
and uses all the property, the wealth that they have.

17:34.722 --> 17:37.946
What is the interest of a person who is religious

17:38.146 --> 17:40.899
in the property of other people?

17:41.099 --> 17:45.052
Why should he be interested in getting the property of another person?

17:45.253 --> 17:47.743
He should not be. On the contrary he should be happy

17:47.943 --> 17:50.926
to see that somebody is happy, well-off with his children,

17:51.126 --> 17:55.543
enjoying a nice happy life.

17:55.743 --> 17:59.773
But there’s no end to this greed. The greed is so much

17:59.973 --> 18:04.843
that it’s impossible to call these people religious by any chance,

18:05.043 --> 18:08.721
and they are the ones who are talking on religion.

18:08.921 --> 18:12.627
Then the other side of it – not only the greed, the lust.

18:12.827 --> 18:19.005
The lust is so obvious,

18:19.205 --> 18:22.669
is so vivid

18:22.869 --> 18:30.020
that one cannot believe that these
people have anything to do with religion.

18:30.220 --> 18:33.423
So it follows with the superficiality,

18:33.624 --> 18:36.870
once you get materialistic.

18:37.071 --> 18:42.053
Then materialism also gives you certain ideas

18:42.253 --> 18:46.318
that you must have legs like this, you must have nose like that,

18:46.518 --> 18:49.474
you must have eyes like that, you must have body like that,

18:49.674 --> 18:52.490
so everybody starts working on that.

18:52.690 --> 18:56.627
In America in the morning if you get up, everybody is running on the streets,

18:56.828 --> 19:02.272
whether old or young. Some people
died of heart attacks on the streets.

19:02.473 --> 19:06.994
They said now they are having a new craze, what is it called as, jogging.

19:07.194 --> 19:09.498
And I had an Indian girl with Me,

19:09.706 --> 19:12.096
and she said – she woke Me up, she said, “Mother, get up, get up!”

19:12.296 --> 19:14.658
I said, “What has happened?” “Something gone wrong in this place.”

19:14.858 --> 19:18.912
I said, “Why?” “Everybody is running.”

19:19.112 --> 19:23.943
I said, “They are jogging.” “No, no, even old people are running.

19:24.143 --> 19:27.304
How can it be something like that?” I said, “It is, that’s their style.

19:27.504 --> 19:31.840
You forget it, let Me sleep!”

19:36.868 --> 19:47.183
Everything should be done in a way
to keep fit and to keep all right,

19:47.383 --> 19:51.948
but not just to sort of fall into the traps

19:52.148 --> 19:56.852
of these people who are spreading materialism.

20:00.148 --> 20:02.827
I told one lady – she was very thin already, and

20:03.028 --> 20:05.046
I said, “Why are you thinning more?”

20:05.247 --> 20:08.036
She said, “Because the modern clothes don’t fit you.”

20:08.236 --> 20:11.333
So I said, “Is it? It’s that according to the modern clothes

20:11.533 --> 20:14.020
you are going to make your body?” She said, “You have to,

20:14.220 --> 20:17.538
otherwise how will you wear the dresses?”

20:17.738 --> 20:20.499
I said, “This is horrid, absolutely horrid”,

20:20.699 --> 20:24.593
horrid system that they force people to wear the dresses,

20:24.793 --> 20:29.210
whatever their standards are.

20:29.410 --> 20:38.773
It has killed all the arts, all the
hand-made things, all the real things.

20:38.973 --> 20:43.664
It has brought everything artificial, everything superficial.

20:43.864 --> 20:47.898
The attention is so superficial. Just now I was watching a film,

20:48.098 --> 20:54.000
some sort of an American film: everybody was sick, everybody was mad.

20:54.200 --> 20:57.000
I mean, I couldn’t understand how could any human being

20:57.200 --> 21:02.242
behave like this? I have not known people like that Myself,

21:02.442 --> 21:05.113
but they showed a sick man behaving

21:05.314 --> 21:09.630
in a very sickly manner, supposed to be a hero.

21:09.830 --> 21:17.716
All these advertisements, all these newspapers, all this media,

21:17.916 --> 21:23.888
all of them are just here to create sensations in your body,

21:24.088 --> 21:28.520
some sort of a sensation. It has to be a sensational thing,

21:28.720 --> 21:32.497
because they think that you have become matter.

21:32.697 --> 21:39.677
Unless and until you give some shocks to the matter, it won’t move.

21:42.450 --> 21:45.531
And that is what they have brought you to,

21:45.731 --> 21:52.293
that’s where we have landed into – a state of matter.

21:52.493 --> 21:56.191
So we have no feelings, we just don’t talk to anyone,

21:56.391 --> 22:01.032
our hearts are frozen. We feel afraid to talk to human beings.

22:01.232 --> 22:05.189
We cannot tolerate our children.

22:05.389 --> 22:08.311
In London in every, every week

22:08.511 --> 22:11.288
– in London city, not I am saying England –

22:11.488 --> 22:15.616
they are killing two children every week.

22:15.816 --> 22:21.053
We have no love for our children, we can’t bear our children.

22:21.253 --> 22:25.655
We have no love for each other, no love for cooking,

22:25.855 --> 22:28.462
no love for doing something for your husband,

22:28.662 --> 22:31.392
husband has no love for doing anything for the wife.

22:31.592 --> 22:34.962
All the time what pictures they show is husband and wife fighting,

22:35.162 --> 22:41.461
all the time – how can there be? There’s no
love, there’s no affection, there’s no kindness.

22:41.661 --> 22:45.430
What is the fight going on? “Why did you spoil the carpet?”

22:45.630 --> 22:48.434
She said, “No, I didn’t spoil the carpet, the children spoilt it.”

22:48.634 --> 22:51.438
“Then why didn’t you clean it?” The fight is on –

22:51.638 --> 22:55.634
for what, for the carpet? What is this carpet?

22:55.834 --> 22:58.587
Is it a permanent stuff? But what is important,

22:58.787 --> 23:01.540
they have to sell the house tomorrow. They have to sell the house,

23:01.740 --> 23:05.019
the carpet must be neat, so everything is sellable,

23:05.219 --> 23:10.042
everything has to be sold, even the wife, husband, children, everything.

23:10.242 --> 23:13.007
They have to be made in such a way they are sellable all the time.

23:13.208 --> 23:15.722
Whatever you buy: you buy a diamond – all right,

23:15.922 --> 23:20.995
it should be sellable. If you want to buy anything precious

23:21.195 --> 23:24.988
it must be sellable, you’ll be surprised.

23:25.188 --> 23:28.527
So nobody can have something that is not standardized.

23:28.727 --> 23:31.948
All the rest, I don’t know, goes into waste I think in these countries.

23:32.148 --> 23:34.297
You have to have everything standardized.

23:34.497 --> 23:37.844
Nothing you can have for your own joy, for your own happiness,

23:38.044 --> 23:45.104
for your own using, for your own love for it.

23:45.304 --> 23:47.925
You give somebody some present, say for example

23:48.125 --> 23:51.972
you give somebody a gold ring, immediately that person will go

23:52.172 --> 24:01.524
to the shopkeeper and ask the jeweler: "Is it gold or not?"

24:01.724 --> 24:06.448
Whether it is, the price is all right or not,

24:06.648 --> 24:12.581
what carat gold – everything. They will
not see to the beauty of the thing.

24:12.781 --> 24:19.714
They will not see to the way the feelings are being expressed.

24:19.914 --> 24:23.370
What they will see is whether it is sellable or not.

24:23.570 --> 24:27.860
“Later on if I want to sell it, even the presents,

24:28.061 --> 24:32.096
if I can sell it it’s better to find out.”

24:32.296 --> 24:37.429
So the whole attitude towards life is that

24:37.630 --> 24:44.031
everything is valued in money, everything is valued in money.

24:44.231 --> 24:48.007
“What is the damage? How much it will cost?

24:48.207 --> 24:53.314
How much we have to pay? How much for the child-bearing?

24:53.514 --> 24:56.603
If you will have one child, how much it will cost?”

24:56.803 --> 25:02.912
Immediately they’ll go to the computer and find out how much it will cost.

25:07.169 --> 25:10.775
Now, like I’m speaking so I should find out

25:10.975 --> 25:14.462
how much it will cost My throat,

25:14.662 --> 25:18.908
that if I’m speaking so many words, like there’s a computer for it.

25:19.108 --> 25:21.642
You put in the computer, you’ll find out it will cost you

25:21.842 --> 25:28.363
five lozenges. All right, charge five lozenges to the Sahaja Yogis.

25:35.941 --> 25:41.340
There’s no feeling. Even they sing, when they walk,

25:41.540 --> 25:44.223
even when they do any work there’s no feeling

25:44.423 --> 25:46.532
and there’s no involvement at all,

25:46.733 --> 25:50.099
no involvement of any kind.

25:50.300 --> 25:55.991
The artistic work that was done before cannot be done today, why?

25:56.191 --> 26:00.340
It is because there is no feeling, there’s no involvement,

26:00.540 --> 26:06.721
there’s no feeling that, that "this is my work, I’m doing it;

26:06.921 --> 26:11.397
I’m doing it to present my own feelings,

26:11.598 --> 26:18.227
to express myself, it’s my own thing". There’s no feeling.

26:18.427 --> 26:24.117
Imagine, you have seen, so many of you have seen now Ajanta.

26:24.317 --> 26:29.649
This was built in ten centuries, cut from top to bottom.

26:29.849 --> 26:32.845
How they must have planned it? How they must have organized

26:33.045 --> 26:35.438
among themselves in ten generations?

26:35.638 --> 26:39.344
How they must have painted it? And there’s nothing,

26:39.544 --> 26:45.133
no city, nothing, no television, no food. How they lived there?

26:45.333 --> 26:52.725
They lived on dedication and love of Buddha, whom they had never seen.

26:53.662 --> 26:59.025
Such personalities they were, such involvement.

26:59.225 --> 27:06.080
Once they took up something they were absolutely dedicated with it.

27:06.280 --> 27:09.913
But such people are lost today because of materialism.

27:10.113 --> 27:13.515
Most important thing is how much money you get out of everything,

27:13.715 --> 27:19.023
there’s no end to it. And then what you take to is thieving.

27:19.223 --> 27:22.273
All these big, big people, the prime minister,

27:22.473 --> 27:27.398
today I was told that this Marcos, the great prime minister,

27:27.598 --> 27:35.473
Filipino fellow gave all his paintings to another thief from Riyad.

27:35.673 --> 27:37.716
They’re all thieves.

27:37.916 --> 27:43.624
All these big, big johnnies supposed to be there are thieves.

27:44.570 --> 27:50.556
Why? What are they lacking? What are they afraid of? Why do they do that?

27:50.757 --> 27:54.247
They are afraid that they’ll be
found out that they are thieves,

27:54.447 --> 27:56.990
so they are doing all these wrong things.

27:57.190 --> 28:00.458
They are collecting money because they know they have to run away one day.

28:00.658 --> 28:04.401
All right, so they must organize in such a way

28:04.602 --> 28:07.466
that they should have all these things planted in some place

28:07.666 --> 28:11.310
where they can always get hold of.

28:11.510 --> 28:14.013
But why become the thief first of all?

28:14.213 --> 28:17.368
You become the prime minister, make a name out of yourself,

28:17.568 --> 28:22.720
your history will remember you. No,
they cannot think of those things,

28:22.920 --> 28:26.927
they just think of the present.

28:27.286 --> 28:31.117
Sahaj way! It’s to make money.

28:31.317 --> 28:36.039
"When you are on the throne, make the money as much as is possible."

28:36.239 --> 28:39.427
This money is going to bring them bad name.

28:39.627 --> 28:42.443
In the progeny they will not be remembered,

28:42.643 --> 28:45.576
people will not take their names. If they take their names,

28:45.776 --> 28:50.836
they will have a headache. So what’s
the use of leading such a life?

28:51.036 --> 28:56.908
Even today human beings in general are not so degenerated

28:57.108 --> 29:00.721
that they put statues of a drunkard

29:00.921 --> 29:04.666
or statues of a man who has been a thief,

29:04.866 --> 29:10.824
who has been managing the whole country
and selling it off to somebody else.

29:11.024 --> 29:16.785
There are no statues of such people. Nobody remembers them.

29:16.985 --> 29:22.787
People don’t like them, such people are hated.

29:25.772 --> 29:29.747
And even if there are statues of such people – I’ve seen that of Stalin –

29:29.947 --> 29:34.392
they remove them.

29:38.032 --> 29:44.644
So this idea of materialism has grown like a ghost now

29:44.844 --> 29:50.681
into the minds of people, that matter is more important;

29:50.881 --> 29:56.779
that materially if you are all right, you are all right.

29:57.465 --> 30:04.711
The other side of it is that you must
show that you don’t care for matter,

30:04.911 --> 30:08.982
that you are not bothered, like these anti-culture people.

30:09.182 --> 30:13.951
But no, materialism is within them, it is engrained in them,

30:14.151 --> 30:18.536
it’s in their blood, they can’t get out of it.

30:18.736 --> 30:22.614
By showing off that "we make our hair in such a manner

30:22.814 --> 30:26.341
that we don’t need a barber",

30:26.541 --> 30:31.367
or else "we dress up with dirty clothes with holes in it

30:31.567 --> 30:36.539
to show that we don’t care for matter", it’s not so.

30:36.739 --> 30:42.311
By changing the matter you do not change the inside within yourself.

30:42.511 --> 30:48.495
Inside is changed when you look at the matter as a witness.

30:49.240 --> 30:54.790
Matter has a purpose. You should
know the purpose of the matter.

30:54.990 --> 30:58.815
If you know the purpose of the matter then you have value,

30:59.015 --> 31:03.011
your value system is correct. For example, this has its own purpose:

31:03.211 --> 31:08.511
it has a purpose that it must deliver the lecture properly.

31:08.711 --> 31:12.624
But if this purpose is not served, it is no good.

31:12.824 --> 31:15.734
In the same way everything has a purpose.

31:15.934 --> 31:21.961
What’s the use of buying fifty artificial blouses,

31:22.161 --> 31:29.913
or thirty-two thousand shoes as this lady had, Mrs. Marcos,

31:30.113 --> 31:34.397
when she’s not going to use even two out of them?

31:34.597 --> 31:38.295
It has no feeling, it has no meaning, it’s selfishness,

31:38.495 --> 31:44.704
it’s self-centeredness. It’s thinking about yourself all the time.

31:46.533 --> 31:49.779
Now you want to give Me a sari.

31:49.979 --> 31:52.834
In Marathi it is called as “pot zakaych,”

31:53.034 --> 31:58.865
means they’re covering the womb of the
Goddess, the stomach of the Mother.

31:59.065 --> 32:03.047
Because She’s put us there, She has given us birth,

32:03.247 --> 32:06.649
so we must give Her something to cover it,

32:06.849 --> 32:10.182
is a very humble way of saying it.

32:10.382 --> 32:13.791
Now you give Me a sari,

32:13.991 --> 32:18.158
I don’t know when I’m going to wear all these, but whatever it is,

32:18.358 --> 32:21.374
just give Me a sari with a feeling,

32:21.574 --> 32:26.983
and maybe I may never wear it, I may wear it also.

32:27.183 --> 32:32.516
But the progeny will see what you have given to your Mother.

32:32.717 --> 32:36.402
I’m not going to carry it with Me, nobody’s going to carry the matter with them.

32:36.602 --> 32:42.264
But it had a purpose, it had a
meaning, it had emotions behind it.

32:42.464 --> 32:46.545
It was given in a puja when so many people gathered,

32:46.745 --> 32:51.006
you gave to your Mother. When people
will see it they’ll be so very happy,

32:51.206 --> 32:54.092
“Oh, the Sydney people gave this,”

32:54.292 --> 32:58.217
or “the Australians gave on this Sahasrara Day.”

32:58.417 --> 33:02.257
See, even the vibrations flow.

33:02.457 --> 33:05.163
Just that, this is what it is.

33:05.363 --> 33:12.746
Now, it has no purpose if you put something up

33:12.946 --> 33:17.606
in a puja which is not necessary.

33:17.806 --> 33:21.369
It has no purpose at all, it has no feeling,

33:21.569 --> 33:24.408
it has no meaning. It is valueless.

33:24.608 --> 33:31.755
For example if you put this up, say, into My bathroom, it is useless.

33:32.380 --> 33:37.784
Specially this one,

33:37.984 --> 33:43.304
because I can’t even sing there.

33:45.163 --> 33:49.956
Quite frightening. Thank God it’s being screened

33:50.156 --> 33:53.796
by Sahaja yogis because they know My conditions, you see,

33:53.996 --> 33:57.734
but it’s so sweet to see the way they have covered it,

33:57.934 --> 33:59.952
because they know their Mother would be quite nervous

34:00.152 --> 34:05.818
to have a bath in a glass bathroom.

34:06.018 --> 34:09.498
That’s all. That shows, you see, that feeling,

34:09.698 --> 34:13.689
that understanding about Me. That fills My heart

34:13.889 --> 34:21.146
with such love, such oneness with you
that you understand Me,

34:21.347 --> 34:25.395
that "Mother may not like, you see, this kind of a glass business."

34:25.595 --> 34:29.684
It’s so sweet to do those things for Me.

34:29.884 --> 34:33.567
Little, little things here and there, whatever we do for others

34:33.767 --> 34:39.606
are so suggestive of our love, of our feelings.

34:39.806 --> 34:45.103
And this is what you have to express today, not the materialism.

34:46.501 --> 34:51.860
We don’t have to express that, that we were very rich people

34:52.060 --> 34:56.767
or that we had lots of diamonds and we had ornaments, nothing.

34:56.967 --> 35:02.001
That is not needed. No, we were people of great feelings.

35:02.201 --> 35:09.742
What they brought for Christ was leaves of palm, palm tree;

35:09.942 --> 35:16.281
singing “Hosanna, hosanna!” like the way you were singing today.

35:16.481 --> 35:20.223
What these palm trees are? Even today they are remembered.

35:20.423 --> 35:30.713
They’ll be remembered eternally, the
palm trees that were used for this.

35:31.658 --> 35:36.779
They didn’t think about it, they
didn’t know what to get at that time.

35:36.979 --> 35:39.474
Whatever was available they got it,

35:39.674 --> 35:44.046
and started singing “Hosanna, hosanna!” to Christ.

35:44.246 --> 35:48.405
All these little, little things become so important,

35:48.605 --> 35:52.016
because you have given value to it.

35:52.216 --> 36:02.346
A little piece, a little clay if you take and put art into it,

36:02.546 --> 36:06.198
put your feelings into it, then that becomes expensive.

36:06.398 --> 36:12.194
Even economics can show that it has become more expensive.

36:12.394 --> 36:20.436
But if you give with feelings and if
you give it to someone with your love,

36:20.636 --> 36:30.128
even that adds to the value; to that person it’s very valuable.

36:36.432 --> 36:43.102
It is remarkable sometimes how little things

36:43.302 --> 36:48.071
just move the whole ocean of My love

36:48.271 --> 36:54.551
into a turbulent, happy, joyous, loving heart.

36:54.751 --> 36:59.426
I sometimes feel that how these little things that they do

36:59.626 --> 37:04.019
and care for Me, express their love,

37:04.219 --> 37:11.024
just moves Me to the highest point of joy.

37:13.057 --> 37:17.646
Then it’s not the matter that is important,

37:17.846 --> 37:21.805
it’s not how much you have spent is important,

37:22.005 --> 37:27.212
it’s not how it has been brought is important.

37:27.412 --> 37:31.501
What is important is how much thought you have given to it;

37:31.701 --> 37:36.626
and that is what is lacking, that there is no thought.

37:36.826 --> 37:41.522
We think, but we do not give thought – it’s two things,

37:41.722 --> 37:45.557
different. We just go on thinking, thinking, doing nothing.

37:45.758 --> 37:51.897
And to give a thought to a thing
is a sign of depth and understanding.

37:52.097 --> 37:58.014
When the matter is given thought, then it becomes important.

37:58.214 --> 38:03.035
Without the thought it is useless, it is sellable all the time,

38:03.235 --> 38:07.106
everything is sellable.

38:07.306 --> 38:10.902
It has no meaning, it has no value.

38:11.102 --> 38:14.720
I hope you will all get out of this ghost,

38:14.920 --> 38:21.049
and get out of the clutches of these
entrepreneurs who are trying to ruin you.

38:21.249 --> 38:28.429
Try to have things which are full of feelings,

38:28.629 --> 38:32.958
which are having some meaning,

38:33.158 --> 38:41.099
and also try to give it to others things which can express your love.

38:41.299 --> 38:48.403
Matter has one great value, that through
matter you can express your love,

38:48.603 --> 38:52.948
you can express your feelings for a person.

38:53.148 --> 38:58.152
Now today at the last minute I was just struggling to get

38:58.352 --> 39:00.972
some presents for you;

39:01.172 --> 39:05.220
I mean, it was such a struggle, you can’t imagine.

39:05.420 --> 39:09.580
I was in a big mess there,

39:09.780 --> 39:13.982
the house was in a mess and all kinds of things happening,

39:14.182 --> 39:16.951
the puja in the morning.

39:17.151 --> 39:21.639
Until about twelve o’clock I could not leave Pune.

39:21.839 --> 39:24.600
So there was no question of buying anything in Bombay.

39:24.800 --> 39:27.421
So I had to do in a very short time

39:27.621 --> 39:33.852
through other people’s help some sort of purchases,

39:34.052 --> 39:36.914
and I’ve been able to buy some few things for you,

39:37.114 --> 39:41.797
so please accept them as a token of My love for you.

39:41.997 --> 39:45.978
Moreover I’ve brought some mangoes, quite a lot of them,

39:46.178 --> 39:52.009
and this your custom authorities have taken them away.

39:52.209 --> 39:54.325
I was very unhappy and they could see that.

39:54.525 --> 39:56.919
I said, “What’s this, are you going to eat these mangoes?”

39:57.119 --> 39:59.181
They said, “No, we are going to fumigate.”

39:59.382 --> 40:01.512
I said, “After fumigation you give it to us,

40:01.713 --> 40:06.168
for My children I’ve brought.” So they understood it and they agreed.

40:06.369 --> 40:09.640
So I hope we get the mangoes for you on Monday.

40:09.840 --> 40:13.017
After all it’s a small thing, but after all

40:13.217 --> 40:18.778
this is the time for you to eat mangoes.

40:29.450 --> 40:33.200
Have you got the presents here? ….

40:50.782 --> 40:56.527
So I have left it to James’ wisdom to name them for people

40:56.727 --> 40:59.597
whom he wanted to give the presents,

40:59.797 --> 41:04.975
and we have smuggled them nicely into your country.

41:05.175 --> 41:12.866
Because we had a mango problem, they allowed us to bring the rest of it!
