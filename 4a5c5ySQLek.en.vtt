WEBVTT

00:01.280 --> 00:05.130
So we’ll have the experience now.

00:05.640 --> 00:07.240
It will take about five minutes

00:07.650 --> 00:09.900
for you because if all the chakras are discussed

00:10.210 --> 00:12.350
already the attention is on that.

00:12.480 --> 00:15.830
Is very simple to put your hands towards Me.

00:16.870 --> 00:21.070
Sahaja Yogi : Everyone steps out his shoes, will you ?

00:28.320 --> 00:29.810
Shri Mataji : It’s better. [to the Sahaja Yogi].

00:30.090 --> 00:32.880
You’ve done a good job Ah

00:33.180 --> 00:34.830
Just put your hands towards Me.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.120
Just like this.

00:38.500 --> 00:42.360
[Shri Mataji takes vibrations of the audience]

00:54.940 --> 00:56.940
Left.

01:08.020 --> 01:10.810
Now, left hand towards Me and right hand towards the Mother Earth.

01:11.070 --> 01:14.250
We’ll give you a balance. You need not close your eyes just now, let’s see.

01:14.440 --> 01:17.080
Put your right hand towards the Mother Earth.

01:18.920 --> 01:22.600
As I told you yesterday left side is our conditioning,

01:23.240 --> 01:26.260
conditioning, subconscious and collective subconscious,

01:26.660 --> 01:28.660
very much at work here.

01:28.860 --> 01:32.110
But also is an emotional side.

01:43.300 --> 01:48.860
Now put your right hand towards Me and left hand towards the sky.

01:49.220 --> 01:52.870
Right hand towards Me, right hand towards Me like this.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.890
Sahaja Yogi : Put your left hand towards the back.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.460
Shri Mataji : Are you feeling the cool breeze in the hand?

02:14.240 --> 02:17.060
You are already thoughtless, there’s no thought,

02:17.240 --> 02:20.580
but just see if you are feeling the cool breeze.

02:25.230 --> 02:27.060
Sahaja Yogi : It’s better [inaudible].

02:27.230 --> 02:29.560
Shri Mataji : Much better

02:29.640 --> 02:30.750
Are you?

02:32.060 --> 02:34.060
Let’s see.

02:34.440 --> 02:41.210
[Shri Mataji blows in the mike].

03:07.820 --> 03:09.820
All right?

03:41.550 --> 03:43.830
Are you feeling any cool breeze in the hand?

03:45.780 --> 03:49.200
All right, now put your left hand on top of your head,

03:50.750 --> 03:52.750
just here,

03:53.090 --> 03:55.090
fontanel bone area.

03:56.350 --> 03:58.350
Are you feeling?

03:58.760 --> 04:00.760
It’s a very subtle thing.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.200
Are you?

04:06.560 --> 04:08.560
Pay attention.

04:11.430 --> 04:14.430
Shri Mataji : [to the Sahaja Yogi]. Working out ; good?

04:14.670 --> 04:17.060
All right. Now, change over.

04:17.120 --> 04:20.880
See the left hand, with the right hand. Just pay attention there, see.

04:30.170 --> 04:32.170
Believe that you are the Spirit.

04:32.380 --> 04:35.930
So just you have to say in your heart: “I am the Spirit”, in your heart.

04:35.980 --> 04:38.090
Say it seven times, it will work out.

04:50.150 --> 04:51.790
Releasing.

04:53.470 --> 04:55.470
Is it all right?

04:56.650 --> 04:58.650
Are you feeling the heat coming out?

04:59.040 --> 05:00.450
Little heat.

05:00.530 --> 05:04.410
All right, now turn, change, see now.

05:23.780 --> 05:27.590
Now, just see, if it is working cool breeze…

05:27.730 --> 05:31.090
[Shri Mataji blows in her hands].

05:32.950 --> 05:36.000
Feel it. Just put your hands like this.

05:47.860 --> 05:49.240
It’s good.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.340
You are all thoughtless. If you see, there’s no thought in your mind.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.140
And complete silence.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.700
Enjoy this.

06:05.040 --> 06:10.460
This moment is going to transform your life, take it from Me.

06:11.600 --> 06:17.260
You may not realize today but you’ll realize it very soon.

06:18.830 --> 06:23.340
Ah, strong.

It’s beautiful.
