So we’ll have the experience now.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.240
It will take about five minutes

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.900
for you because if all the chakras are discussed

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.350
already the attention is on that.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.830
Is very simple to put your hands towards Me.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.070

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.810

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.880
You’ve done a good job Ah

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.830
Just put your hands towards Me.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.120
Just like this.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.360

We’ll give you a balance. You need not close your eyes just now, let’s see.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.080
Put your right hand towards the Mother Earth.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.600
As I told you yesterday left side is our conditioning,

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.260
conditioning, subconscious and collective subconscious,

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.660
very much at work here.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.110
But also is an emotional side.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.860
Now put your right hand towards Me and left hand towards the sky.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.870
Right hand towards Me, right hand towards Me like this.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.890
Sahaja Yogi : Put your left hand towards the back.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.460
Shri Mataji : Are you feeling the cool breeze in the hand?

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.060
You are already thoughtless, there’s no thought,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.580
but just see if you are feeling the cool breeze.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.060
Sahaja Yogi : It’s better [inaudible].

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.560
Shri Mataji : Much better

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.750

Are you feeling any cool breeze in the hand?

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.200

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.760
It’s a very subtle thing.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.200
Are you?

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.560
Pay attention.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.430
Shri Mataji : [to the Sahaja Yogi]. Working out ; good?

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.060
All right. Now, change over.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.880
See the left hand, with the right hand. Just pay attention there, see.

Believe that you are the Spirit.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.930
So just you have to say in your heart: “I am the Spirit”, in your heart.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.090
Say it seven times, it will work out.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.790

Are you feeling the heat coming out?

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.450
Little heat.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.410
All right, now turn, change, see now.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.500
Right Swadhishthan.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.050

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.240
It’s good.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.340
You are all thoughtless. If you see, there’s no thought in your mind.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.140
And complete silence.
