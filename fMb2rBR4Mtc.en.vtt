00:00:09.808 --> 00:00:14.517
Today we all have assembled here

00:00:20.142 --> 00:00:29.017
to pay our respect to Shri Ganesha.

00:00:37.183 --> 00:00:42.058
Ganapatipule has a special significance

00:00:48.683 --> 00:00:54.183
because He is Mahaganesha.

00:00:57.058 --> 00:01:00.183
The Ganesha at Mooladhara

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.600
becomes Mahaganesha

00:01:05.808 --> 00:01:08.975
in the Virata, that is the brain.

00:01:11.225 --> 00:01:15.891
That means it is the seat of Shri Ganesha.

00:01:17.434 --> 00:01:20.975
That means Shri Ganesha governs

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:31.600
from that seat the principle of innocence.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.225
As you know very well it is placed at the back

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.434
in the region of optic thalamus,

00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:51.975
optic lobe as they call it,

00:01:55.725 --> 00:02:06.559
and it is the giver of innocence to the eyes.

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:16.600
When He incarnated as Christ

00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:22.434
which is in here in the front, at Agnya

00:02:23.683 --> 00:02:26.933
He said very clearly that

00:02:26.933 --> 00:02:30.933
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

00:02:33.434 --> 00:02:36.183
It's a very subtle saying,

00:02:37.058 --> 00:02:39.600
which people don't understand

00:02:40.641 --> 00:02:44.350
what is the meaning of the word "adultery."

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:51.183
"Adultery" means "impurity" in a general word.

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:57.641
Any impurity in the eye "thou shalt not have"

00:02:58.434 --> 00:03:01.350
it's very difficult.

00:03:01.725 --> 00:03:05.058
Instead of saying that you get your realization

00:03:05.058 --> 00:03:07.725
and clear your back Agnya,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.434
He has said it in a very short form,

00:03:10.725 --> 00:03:13.975
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

00:03:14.933 --> 00:03:19.517
And people thought, it's an impossible situation.

00:03:20.683 --> 00:03:23.350
Because He was not allowed to live long;

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.142
actually His public life is limited

00:03:26.142 --> 00:03:28.392
to three-and-a-half years only.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.058
So whatever He has said has a very great significance,

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.183
that your eyes should not be adulterous.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.225
When there is innocence there is no adultery:

00:03:47.725 --> 00:03:50.725
it means there's no impurity.

00:03:51.517 --> 00:03:53.600
For example, with our eyes

00:03:53.975 --> 00:04:01.725
we see something and we want to possess it.

00:04:02.725 --> 00:04:05.058
We start thinking.

00:04:05.933 --> 00:04:08.559
The thought starts

00:04:09.766 --> 00:04:12.559
like a chain, one after another.

00:04:13.058 --> 00:04:25.225
And then we get into the web of horrible thoughts,

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.225
and then we become slaves of those thoughts.

00:04:30.725 --> 00:04:32.850
Without even our knowledge,

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.309
our eyes are turned to things

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.183
which are very gross

00:04:41.183 --> 00:04:43.600
and take you downward.

00:04:48.933 --> 00:04:53.183
As Shri Krishna has said that the Tree of Awareness

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.225
grows upside-down,

00:04:58.725 --> 00:05:04.766
that the roots are in the brain

00:05:05.225 --> 00:05:08.225
and the branches grow downward.

00:05:08.225 --> 00:05:10.600
Those who have gone towards materialism

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.725
have grown downward.

00:05:13.142 --> 00:05:17.517
Those who have gone towards Divine

00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:20.683
have grown upwards, towards the roots.

00:05:22.183 --> 00:05:25.392
The main root, as they call the taproot,

00:05:25.641 --> 00:05:33.267
the main root is innocence, is Shri Ganesha.

00:05:33.933 --> 00:05:38.933
And He becomes Mahaganesha in Ganapatipule.

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:44.850
Here He's surrounded

00:05:45.683 --> 00:05:49.058
by the Father Principle, the Guru Principle

00:05:52.350 --> 00:06:02.475
of the sea, the ocean - the Indian Ocean.

00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:15.392
That is, here He becomes a Guru.

00:06:18.183 --> 00:06:20.350
When a Sahaja yogi

00:06:21.225 --> 00:06:23.850
establishes his Shri Ganesha Principle,

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.058
he's still a child.

00:06:30.142 --> 00:06:36.267
Of course his eyes start becoming purer and purer,

00:06:36.808 --> 00:06:40.517
and powerful and glistening.

00:06:42.225 --> 00:06:46.766
You must have seen when the kundalini gives you

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.017
the realization

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:56.683
then your eyes start gleaming,

00:06:57.183 --> 00:06:59.517
like a spark is there in the eyes,

00:06:59.725 --> 00:07:02.517
you can make out a spark.

00:07:04.475 --> 00:07:07.142
With ego it gets covered,

00:07:11.891 --> 00:07:20.683
with ego it blinds.

00:07:22.017 --> 00:07:27.517
With superego it is covered with tears.

00:07:30.725 --> 00:07:33.183
But when they are clear

00:07:33.683 --> 00:07:37.600
you see the beauty of the eyes,

00:07:43.058 --> 00:07:48.183
Shri Ganesha shining through your glances.

00:07:56.183 --> 00:07:59.475
The attention now starts flowing

00:07:59.725 --> 00:08:03.100
through the window of Shri Ganesha's temple.

00:08:06.808 --> 00:08:09.475
But when you mature,

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.891
you become Mahaganesha.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.267
Then Mahaganesha is established in you

00:08:21.766 --> 00:08:25.517
and you become a satguru,

00:08:26.475 --> 00:08:31.017
you become a divine guru, you can teach others.

00:08:33.725 --> 00:08:36.517
Even a child could be that

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:40.600
even a grown-up person may be stupid.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:49.392
It has nothing to do with age, color, creed or caste.

00:08:49.891 --> 00:08:55.559
It is a state to which one can reach at any time.

00:08:55.933 --> 00:08:59.058
Like we can say here we had Gyaneshwara,

00:08:59.309 --> 00:09:01.559
who at a very young age

00:09:05.641 --> 00:09:10.350
composed the great Gyaneshwari.

00:09:12.559 --> 00:09:14.017
As you have seen yesterday,

00:09:14.309 --> 00:09:16.975
at the age of twelve years Gorakhnath

00:09:17.933 --> 00:09:21.600
established his Mahaganesha.

00:09:26.641 --> 00:09:30.850
But if you do not try to ascend,

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:33.058
then you'll remain at the same stage

00:09:33.058 --> 00:09:35.183
even when you grow old.

00:09:36.434 --> 00:09:40.225
So maturity is the indication.

00:09:40.975 --> 00:09:44.100
Here, as we see in Ganapatipule,

00:09:44.434 --> 00:09:50.517
Shri Ganesha is in its complete, matured form

00:09:54.933 --> 00:09:59.517
so that we develop also our Mahaganesha

00:09:59.517 --> 00:10:01.183
within ourselves,

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:12.100
and our eyes become pure, powerful and divine.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.225
With proper working out,

00:10:24.058 --> 00:10:32.933
I am sure we can establish that state within ourselves.

00:10:36.683 --> 00:10:42.017
Today we came to Ganapatipule, it has a great significance,

00:10:42.599 --> 00:10:44.142
among the Asthavinayaka (eight Swayambhus of Shri Ganesha),

00:10:44.683 --> 00:10:47.641
It is the place of Mahaganesha.

00:10:49.683 --> 00:10:55.183
Mahaganesha is Pithadhish (Governor of all pithas)

00:10:57.559 --> 00:10:59.600
and sitting on this pitha,

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:05.766
he protects all the Ganesha Swayambhus.

00:11:07.975 --> 00:11:10.475
He has the knowledge of all the Omkaras,

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:16.599
as he has attained the Guru Tatwa (Guru Principle).

00:11:18.808 --> 00:11:22.309
If we see in the surroundings,

00:11:23.225 --> 00:11:25.309
the ocean, so beautiful and clean

00:11:26.183 --> 00:11:28.850
is washing the feet of this Ganapati,

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:39.017
because the ocean represents the Guru Tatwa,

00:11:40.183 --> 00:11:45.350
and with that Guru Tatwa, he washes the feet of Shri Ganesha

00:11:48.599 --> 00:11:52.392
that is how it should happen with all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:11:53.766 --> 00:11:56.559
Ganesha Stuthi is done and then Shri Ganesha is established

00:11:57.309 --> 00:12:01.183
and thereafter with the Mahalaxmi Tatwa

00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:07.017
you have to become Mahaganeshas.

00:12:09.808 --> 00:12:13.475
This state can be achieved by children small and big,

00:12:14.392 --> 00:12:18.309
elderly people, ladies and everyone,

00:12:19.142 --> 00:12:25.725
if they can attain the straight forward behaviour,

00:12:26.808 --> 00:12:31.641
which we call as   Saralya  in Marathi, or they say Abhodita

00:12:32.267 --> 00:12:38.058
or innocence, when it is once imbibed in us,

00:12:39.434 --> 00:12:41.559
we can achieve the Guru Principle.

00:12:41.975 --> 00:12:46.891
Whichever Guru, who does not have this straight forward nature

00:12:47.017 --> 00:12:49.766
and innocence, he can never be a Guru,

00:12:49.975 --> 00:12:51.100
he is a Aguru (false Guru).

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.559
The person, whose attention is always on the Divine Power,

00:12:56.559 --> 00:12:58.559
only he can become a real Guru.

00:13:02.225 --> 00:13:05.559
The attention of normal human beings is perverted,

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.766
it is not clean. For this Christ has said,

00:13:11.225 --> 00:13:14.933
there should be no adultery in your eyes,

00:13:15.475 --> 00:13:20.183
means that if we put our attention on something,

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:24.808
we start thinking a lot and strange thoughts come to our mind,

00:13:25.183 --> 00:13:26.808
as to how I can acquire this thing

00:13:27.058 --> 00:13:28.559
and why I did not get this thing,

00:13:28.766 --> 00:13:30.183
and other thoughts as to why and why not.

00:13:30.766 --> 00:13:33.309
If we see something and start thinking, then

00:13:33.891 --> 00:13:38.058
you have not yet crossed the Agnya Chakra.

00:13:39.599 --> 00:13:41.434
Whatever object you see, you should become thoughtless,

00:13:41.599 --> 00:13:47.641
especially in the heavenly abode of wealth and prosperity

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:52.641
there are numerous Gods and Goddesses

00:13:52.891 --> 00:13:55.058
at least by seeing them, one should become thoughtless.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.517
Once we attain the state of thoughtless awareness,

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:58.766
no perversion will remain in our attention any more.

00:13:58.891 --> 00:14:01.350
The thoughts perverting the mind will not come anymore,

00:14:01.933 --> 00:14:03.599
so how will perversion influence you.

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:07.475
That means like Christ said,

00:14:07.559 --> 00:14:10.142
thou shall not have adulterous eyes.

00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:13.683
They should be so pure, like the rays of the sun,

00:14:14.058 --> 00:14:19.475
when they fall on trees, they do no absorb the dirt,

00:14:20.225 --> 00:14:24.850
they nourish and nurture them, not only that

00:14:25.267 --> 00:14:27.600
but they also give them strength.

00:14:28.309 --> 00:14:30.850
In a similar way,

00:14:31.142 --> 00:14:35.142
the Sahaja Yogis should have such radiance in their eyes, that

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:43.725
they can create a very pure atmosphere in the whole world.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:48.517
Purity in the atmosphere is what we need today, everywhere,

00:14:49.517 --> 00:14:58.058
so that peace, joy and divine power can prevail in this world.

00:15:01.683 --> 00:15:05.600
Only singing the praise of Shri Ganesha may not be sufficient,

00:15:05.808 --> 00:15:07.808
Shri Ganesha needs to be awakened within us

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:10.683
and he should evolve to the state of Mahaganesha.

00:15:11.267 --> 00:15:13.517
Only after attaining the state of Mahaganesha,

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.434
can our country benefit and also through our country,

00:15:17.599 --> 00:15:19.600
other countries can benefit from this state.

00:15:19.725 --> 00:15:21.933
We are going to lead the others,

00:15:22.017 --> 00:15:27.350
but if we do not take up this responsibility,

00:15:27.808 --> 00:15:31.517
then I cannot say, what will happen of this whole world.

00:15:31.975 --> 00:15:34.808
I have a request to you all,

00:15:35.058 --> 00:15:37.891
to remove all the adultery in your eyes.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:43.309
For this we have the mantra of Nirvichara in Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:43.725 --> 00:15:45.309
Do not allow the thoughts to dominate you,

00:15:45.392 --> 00:15:47.350
if thoughts come, then say

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:51.975
  Yen Neti Neti Vachane  (it doesn't exist)

00:15:52.475 --> 00:15:55.017
or say   Kshama Keli, Kshama Keli   (I forgive, I forgive),

00:15:55.475 --> 00:15:56.933
so that this thought is destroyed

00:15:57.017 --> 00:15:58.683
and once thoughtlessness is attained,

00:16:00.225 --> 00:16:04.434
then the perversion of the mind stops.

00:16:04.641 --> 00:16:07.100
Everybody should make an attempt,

00:16:07.309 --> 00:16:09.850
that your eyes are not adulterous.

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.599
 "If there is perversion in the mind because of my eyes,

00:16:12.725 --> 00:16:16.933
then I do not want to have such eyes ", said Saint Tukaram,

00:16:17.183 --> 00:16:20.267
 "then, it is better to be blind ".

00:16:20.517 --> 00:16:25.766
In one way, it is better being blind,

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:27.808
than have perversion in the mind.

00:16:27.933 --> 00:16:30.434
Rather have inner eyes to see Divinity.

00:16:30.475 --> 00:16:32.766
When these two principles come together properly,

00:16:33.309 --> 00:16:36.142
then one can say that

00:16:36.392 --> 00:16:38.559
the Sahaja Yogi has attained the Guru Principle.

00:16:39.475 --> 00:16:44.975
I bless you all, that here at Ganapatipule,

00:16:45.225 --> 00:16:49.475
the place of Mahaganesha, with his special grace,

00:16:49.891 --> 00:16:53.058
you all can attain your Guru Principle as soon as possible.

00:31:37.017 --> 00:31:43.183
First they will take the twenty-four names of Shri Vishnu,

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:48.183
so that this Sushumna Nadi will open out.

00:31:48.517 --> 00:31:50.725
Then they will say the Shri Sukta,

00:31:51.017 --> 00:31:54.933
is the one to awaken the energy within you.

00:31:55.267 --> 00:32:01.725
Then they will say the 108 name of Mother Gauri.

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:07.808
After that pujan, when this puja is over,

00:32:08.058 --> 00:32:11.267
then we will be doing a

00:32:19.392 --> 00:32:22.766
Eleven kundas we have got,

00:32:23.183 --> 00:32:29.517
and we'll be doing the havana on eleven kundas.

00:32:30.017 --> 00:32:35.183
Because the Mahaganesha is the ruler,

00:32:35.725 --> 00:32:40.142
is the ruler of Ekadesha Rudra.

00:32:40.641 --> 00:32:42.850
So that has to be done with great devotion

00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:44.434
and dedication.

00:32:44.808 --> 00:32:48.475
I would suggest that first is finished this puja,

00:32:48.808 --> 00:32:50.475
you can have your food,

00:32:50.725 --> 00:32:54.933
and afterwards we'll sit down for the havan.
