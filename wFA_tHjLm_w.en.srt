1
00:00:07,772 --> 00:00:17,741
The sign of life is that it goes against the matter,

2
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:21,007
the one that is jara.

3
00:00:28,573 --> 00:00:33,329
Like the tree goes against the gravity;

4
00:00:38,051 --> 00:00:42,310
like the great human beings have lifted their body

5
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,529
against the gravity in a straight posture.

6
00:00:53,171 --> 00:00:59,788
In the same way, if you see, the flame goes against the gravity.

7
00:01:04,853 --> 00:01:11,393
Nobody has heard of fire going from the top floor to the ground floor.

8
00:01:16,654 --> 00:01:20,785
It starts from the ground floor and it goes upward.

9
00:01:24,323 --> 00:01:31,486
But the fire also comes from the matter which is burning.

10
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:43,732
So the matter has to be burnt, if you want to rise.

11
00:01:47,805 --> 00:01:52,554
If your attention is all the time towards baser things,

12
00:01:52,554 --> 00:02:00,534
materialistic things, towards physical pleasures, you cannot rise.

13
00:02:09,966 --> 00:02:14,843
You may do any amount of meditations, use My Photographs, come to My Pujas

14
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,481
but if your attention is imbedded

15
00:02:17,481 --> 00:02:23,487
it's like you are standing on a crocodile trying to get into a boat.

16
00:02:39,722 --> 00:02:45,372
Now, that doesn't mean when a flame burns it gives up matter,

17
00:02:50,925 --> 00:02:55,388
but it gets detached and it burns it.

18
00:02:59,697 --> 00:03:06,374
So this body, this mind, this ego, this superego,

19
00:03:06,622 --> 00:03:13,881
is all to be burned to keep this flame burning all the time.

20
00:03:23,611 --> 00:03:26,737
You don't have to give up anything

21
00:03:26,608 --> 00:03:31,371
but to use the same thing for a higher life,

22
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:46,188
and that is what should be the aim of every Sahaja Yogi.
