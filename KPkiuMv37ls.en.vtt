00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.920
Today, for the first time,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.840
I’m venturing to say something

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.320
which I should have said much earlier.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:56.160
As today I told you that it is necessary that you have to recognise Me.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.600
And that recognition is fixed, that condition is fixed.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.920
I cannot change it.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.800
Perhaps this is the first time I am saying this to you,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.960
that you have to dedicate yourself completely to Me

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.040
- not to Sahaja Yoga - but to Me.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.560
Sahaja Yoga is just one of My aspects.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.840
Leaving everything, you have to dedicate.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.080
Complete dedication, otherwise you cannot ascend any further.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.400
Without questioning, without arguing.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.920
Complete dedication is the only way you can achieve it.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.200
People still get caught up, still get into problems.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.680
What’s the reason?

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:03.720
So many people ask Me that, “Once we have got Realization, how is it Mother we go down?”

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.840
The only reason is the dedication is not complete.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.680
Is complete reverence and complete dedication has been not established.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:27.960
You still do not know that I am Divine, to that extent as you should.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:42.440
Now the name of your Mother is very powerful.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:56.680
You know that is the most powerful Name than all other names, the most powerful mantra.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.440
But you must know how to take it.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.760
With that complete dedication you have to take that Name.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.240
Not like any other name.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:16.520
This mantra is a very powerful mantra.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:24.320
Only what you need is the dedication, the dynamite of dedication.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:36.440
The first thing in today's modern Sahaja Yoga, you have to know that you have to recognize Me.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.760
That is very important.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.640
Very humbly, I have to tell you - you have to recognize Me and you have to respect Me

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.560
and love Me.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:58.880
If in these words, if I can explain to you, that you cannot have a double life.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.440
You cannot show love and another side you try to trouble Me.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:15.480
First thing is that so far there has been no en-mass realization, no en-mass realization

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.040
and when there is no en-mass realization, we cannot blame the people

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.360
if they did not recognize these incarnations, because without realization, how can they recognize?

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:36.840
But after en-mass realization, if you do not recognize, then it's a serious thing.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.240
So recognition only mean, doesn't mean that you recognize Me as Adi Shakti,

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:53.320
but recognition means that in every part of your life, you should know that I am with you.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.560
Disciplining in Sahaja Yoga has to be automatic.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:11.520
I don't have to tell you about disciplining, but it doesn't work out, then I have to tell you.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.840
The first discipline, is that you have to recognize Me and respect Me.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:31.320
But today is the day, I declare that I am the One who has to save the humanity.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.520
I declare I am the One who is Adishakti,

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:52.880
who is the Mother of all the Mothers, who is the Primordial Mother,

00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:01.840
the Shakti, the Desire of God, who has incarnated on this Earth

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.680
to give its meaning to itself,

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.240
to this creation, to human beings,

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:24.560
and I’m sure through My love and patience and My powers, I am going to achieve it.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.000
I was the One who was born again and again,

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:53.280
but now in My complete form and complete powers,

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.960
I have come on this Earth,

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.400
not only for salvation of human beings,

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.680
not only for their emancipation,

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:18.840
but for granting them the Kingdom of Heaven, the Joy, the Bliss,

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:26.400
that your Father wants to bestow upon you.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:32.120
Among you, there are people who are still not...

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.040
been able to recognize.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:58.240
My announcement will work it out within them – the recognition.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:03.080
Without recognition you cannot see the play,

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:09.280
without play, you cannot have confidence within yourself,

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:13.840
without confidence you cannot become Guru,

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.400
without becoming Guru you cannot help others,

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:24.240
and without helping others you are not going to be in any way happy.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:28.280
So, to break the chain

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:39.680
is very easy, but to build the chain one after another

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.200
is what you have to do.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:53.760
This is what you were all wanting to be.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:06.320
So, be confident and be joyous, and be happy

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:13.280
that all My powers will protect you,

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:21.120
My Love will nourish you,

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:36.000
and My nature will fill you with peace and joy.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:47.720
So in Sahaja Yoga it is very important to keep your Sahasrara open,

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.160
otherwise there's a vicious circle.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.760
To keep the Sahasrara open is in a way very easy,

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.200
as well as difficult.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.640
As you have known in the Devi Mahatmyam

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:12.080
that at Sahasrara, Mahamaya comes.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:17.440
She is a Mahamaya: not easy to recognize Her,

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.280
not easy to know Her.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.280
She lives just like you,

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.640
She moves just like you,

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:33.880
and you can never make out Her real nature.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.040
She is in the form of Mahamaya.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:48.800
So at the Sahasrara, to recognize the Mahamaya is another vicious circle.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:54.920
In the Mahamaya form you have to recognize.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.600
This is another test because Mahamaya you cannot recognize,

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.240
while you have to recognize.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:10.400
But in Sahaja Yoga you have seen so many photographs

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:15.000
which should convince you people mentally

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.160
about this Mahamaya swarupa.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:23.640
Another way is that you start seeing the blessings,

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:29.400
and you start seeing how you become so progressively

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:35.000
better materially, physically, emotionally, and spiritually.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:41.920
Still on a mental level most of the people recognize.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:53.040
But unless and until it is recognized in the heart,

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.280
it's no recognition.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:07.680
But still the recognition on the heart is not there.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:13.280
Even without that you start feeling the cool breeze,

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.400
you can raise the kundalini of others

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.920
you can cure people,

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.120
you can do many things,

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:30.480
but still it is not yet felt in the heart so much.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:35.880
Now what experience you should have

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:41.520
to build that in your heart, is the point.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:50.920
And the experience is of your own divinity,

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:57.600
of your own spirituality.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:08.280
Once you start developing that experience,

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:13.120
then you know that you are a divine person.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:21.520
Unless and until you are aware fully that you are a divine person,

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:28.480
howsoever faith you may have in Me, the recognition is not complete

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.720
because who is recognizing Me is a blind person.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.280
If a blind person is recognizing Me,

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:41.280
it won't have that response of the heart.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:46.520
So first you have to recognize yourself to be a divine person,

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.960
to have faith in yourself.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.640
So, in Sahastrara Puja, actually,

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:57.840
you have to recognise your own divinity, that you are divine,

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.200
by experiencing your divinity.
