1
00:00:01,222 --> 00:00:10,187
Today is a special day. There is
a combination of two things happening.

2
00:00:10,388 --> 00:00:14,937
[First I will speak in English then
Marathi].

3
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:21,366
Today is first in the morning time, 
at 8:50 in the morning,

4
00:00:21,567 --> 00:00:27,760
was a very important date that started
at 8:50 in the morning,

5
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:31,558
called as Ratha Saptami – is the seventh
day.

6
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:38,128
And it is said that the Sun travels

7
00:00:42,147 --> 00:00:52,047
with his seven forces,

8
00:00:52,256 --> 00:01:00,238
or say, seven colours in a big chariot.

9
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:05,018
And today they celebrate this day
as a day when

10
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:11,488
the Sun travels with the divine vibrations
all over the world, and illumines.

11
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:19,525
But it was too early for anyone of you
to do this, so till -

12
00:01:19,726 --> 00:01:25,973
I got up very early of course, and worked
out that part for you.

13
00:01:26,231 --> 00:01:30,355
The second important thing which is
a combination,

14
00:01:30,556 --> 00:01:37,760
which is a very, very auspicious thing –
that you get on one day, two dates.

15
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,264
One is Ratha Saptami, on that day
you cannot do havana,

16
00:01:42,465 --> 00:01:45,715
because it is the Surya already is there.

17
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:48,530
So the second thing is, [which] today
we do,

18
00:01:48,731 --> 00:01:54,431
is a very great puja of Ashtami
(eighth day):

19
00:01:54,632 --> 00:01:59,688
is the day when the Goddess killed

20
00:01:59,889 --> 00:02:05,022
nine rakshasas together with Her eight
hands.

21
00:02:05,223 --> 00:02:07,358
So today is a very special day

22
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:11,171
for which a very special attention
is needed.

23
00:02:11,372 --> 00:02:15,511
It’s only at the behest of the bhaktas

24
00:02:15,712 --> 00:02:20,452
that the Goddess took Her form and killed 
all these rakshasas.

25
00:02:20,653 --> 00:02:27,615
Also with Her eight hands, She killed
Mahishasura.

26
00:02:27,816 --> 00:02:32,155
That’s why She is called as Mahishasura
Mardini. She is called as Nava Chandi,

27
00:02:32,356 --> 00:02:36,526
the One who has killed nine Chandas,
means nine rakshasas She has killed.

28
00:02:36,727 --> 00:02:41,672
So is a very important day, and very vital,
and very deep.

29
00:02:41,873 --> 00:02:44,104
It’s very simple to say, “Mother, we have
fixed

30
00:02:44,305 --> 00:02:47,027
Your puja on such and such day.”

31
00:02:47,228 --> 00:02:52,159
Nobody thinks what Mother has to work
behind the whole thing, you see.

32
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,234
You can’t fix My puja. It’s not proper.

33
00:02:55,435 --> 00:02:59,350
It is I who can tell you what time is
the best for you to do the puja.

34
00:02:59,551 --> 00:03:05,834
So it starts at two minutes past twelve.

35
00:03:06,035 --> 00:03:09,399
So now we can start it, and that’s why
do I delayed My bath.

36
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,146
But that would be too late, so I started
My bath little early.

37
00:03:14,347 --> 00:03:21,052
[Marathi aside] Then only we can do it.

38
00:03:21,253 --> 00:03:22,938
So today is the day of the Goddess,

39
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:24,852
a very important day that you are here.

40
00:03:25,053 --> 00:03:28,127
Somehow we are having all the pujas
on 9 days,

41
00:03:28,328 --> 00:03:31,746
and that’s why I am wearing this special
type of a sari,

42
00:03:31,947 --> 00:03:36,950
which is to be used for Ashta Bhuja’s
Vahana,

43
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:41,390
is a tiger as well as a lion.

44
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,814
Imagine where I’m staying, there is
a photograph of a tiger and a lion both,

45
00:03:47,015 --> 00:03:50,329
in that room. You can go and see
for yourself.

46
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:58,146
Normally you never get these, but that is
there, is a beautiful photograph,

47
00:03:58,347 --> 00:04:03,517
enlarged, of a tiger and a lion.

48
00:04:03,718 --> 00:04:07,743
So in the morning the Surya was
very beautiful,

49
00:04:07,944 --> 00:04:12,490
I don’t know if you saw the morning sun.

50
00:04:12,675 --> 00:04:16,089
At least tomorrow try to see.

51
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:20,627
It’s not important how long you sleep here,
what food you eat,

52
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:22,972
whether you get it in time and all that.

53
00:04:23,173 --> 00:04:25,866
You should get rid of these habits.
It’s very important

54
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:28,880
that these regularities and all these
mundane type of things,

55
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:30,802
the bounding of timing and all that –

56
00:04:31,003 --> 00:04:33,464
you must get out of it space and time,
everything.

57
00:04:33,665 --> 00:04:35,645
And should not go on worrying about things,

58
00:04:35,846 --> 00:04:39,958
because you get so exhausted, without
doing any work you feel exhausted.

59
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:43,878
Because you are so fixed up, so fixed up

60
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,179
that you can’t get out of these habits,
you see.

61
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,711
While the Indians are not fixed up
like that,

62
00:04:48,912 --> 00:04:50,737
they know that Mother knows the best,

63
00:04:50,938 --> 00:04:53,919
She will come at the time when the puja
has to be done.

64
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,594
So, one should try to understand that
if I am the One,

65
00:04:58,795 --> 00:05:00,541
then why should you worry?

66
00:05:00,742 --> 00:05:04,493
But I have one problem with the Western
mind,

67
00:05:04,694 --> 00:05:09,708
is that if they cannot conceive it, they’ll
start criticising.

68
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:13,855
Instead of making yourself subtler and
subtler to conceive

69
00:05:14,056 --> 00:05:15,656
the beauty of the Divine,

70
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:19,003
if you don’t get it, you will start
criticising on any point,

71
00:05:19,204 --> 00:05:22,259
anything you can get hold of, and you’ll
start criticising.

72
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,237
So that’s not the way we can grow.

73
00:05:24,438 --> 00:05:28,927
That’s why I’m telling you beforehand that
this puja is very important,

74
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,527
and at this puja, you have to request

75
00:05:31,728 --> 00:05:35,160
that these nine Chandas, who are still
there, should be killed

76
00:05:35,361 --> 00:05:39,597
and this Mahishasura also should be killed,
they should be driven out.

77
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:44,528
And that’s how it is going to work out
and it’s very important.

78
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:49,104
[It’s] very important, I have to work it
out Myself.

79
00:05:49,305 --> 00:05:52,485
[You] see, it’s not easy just to organise
a programme

80
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,654
like a, preside over something, you just
come along -

81
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,279
it is not that way. It’s much, much deeper,

82
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,991
it has much deeper significance,
much deeper work has to be done.

83
00:06:03,192 --> 00:06:06,412
So many things have to [be] worked out.
It’s a very subtle thing.

84
00:06:06,613 --> 00:06:09,422
And the more you discuss it, the more you
talk about it, you’ll lose it,

85
00:06:09,623 --> 00:06:12,772
you should keep quiet and absorb it.

86
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:17,059
So today is not a day of such a mundane
type, is very important

87
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:21,924
in this small place, where we are sitting,
we are doing a tremendous job.

88
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:25,806
And you people, who have suffered the most
on account of these rakshasas,

89
00:06:26,007 --> 00:06:32,789
should be absolutely intensively be careful
that these sinners must go out.

90
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,094
Something has to be done, instead
of thinking about yourself

91
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:39,382
and your inconveniences, your troubles and
whatever you call them,

92
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:43,210
which are not so important at all!

93
00:06:44,345 --> 00:06:49,362
You are saints and you must support
all divine work

94
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:52,517
by complete understanding.

95
00:06:52,718 --> 00:06:55,649
On the contrary, if you are so much worried
about your own things,

96
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,352
I mean, you are of no use, to yourself
or to Sahaja Yoga.

97
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:05,534
So I would say that even some people will
see that this happened, that happened.

98
00:07:05,735 --> 00:07:09,928
Perhaps the group is a bit too big
to accommodate in all these places.

99
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:13,670
I always had a feeling that the group
is increasing a bit too much.

100
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:16,999
And we didn’t have any idea of so many
people coming in.

101
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:22,066
But doesn’t matter – they are sharing, we
are settled down, there’s a place to sleep.

102
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:26,637
And if you can understand this, [you] see,
that these things are not important,

103
00:07:26,838 --> 00:07:30,020
then you go to England and just sleep, or
you go to Australia and just sleep.

104
00:07:30,221 --> 00:07:32,348
I mean, you have all the time to do
all that.

105
00:07:32,549 --> 00:07:37,894
Just now you are here to become subtler
and subtler.

106
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:45,290
Now the time has started and the Brahmin
also came at the right time

107
00:07:45,491 --> 00:07:52,109
So we have to be one with the subtleties.

108
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,290
Sahaja Yoga is not possible if you want
to see it

109
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:58,727
from a gross level: you cannot understand 
Sahaja Yoga [that way].

110
00:07:58,928 --> 00:08:01,171
I have already told you that without
realisation,

111
00:08:01,372 --> 00:08:03,463
you cannot have Sahaja Yoga.

112
00:08:03,664 --> 00:08:06,635
But even after realisation, if you stick
on to those old things

113
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:11,129
which belongs to the egg time, you will
have no advantage.

114
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:17,032
So try to become subtler and subtler,
and don’t think about it.

115
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:20,448
You will relax, you will feel better,
it will act.

116
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:22,504
That you should have food at the right
time,

117
00:08:22,705 --> 00:08:25,996
you must have this at the right time,
this should be the food - this is, I mean,

118
00:08:26,197 --> 00:08:30,063
it’s such a stuck up thing, you know.

119
00:08:30,264 --> 00:08:33,065
We cannot be stuck up with food, we
cannot be stuck up with all these things.

120
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:40,384
You are going to a level where nobody
has reached.

121
00:08:42,704 --> 00:08:47,207
With this understanding if you become
surrendered –

122
00:08:47,408 --> 00:08:49,901
means not to give Me anything,

123
00:08:50,102 --> 00:08:55,242
but to get rid of your ego and your stuck
up ideas which there have been –

124
00:08:55,443 --> 00:08:59,020
it would be a very good thing.

125
00:08:59,547 --> 00:09:03,630
When you discuss also among yourselves,
nobody should discuss inconveniences.

126
00:09:03,831 --> 00:09:07,799
I had told you that in a village it’s
a very difficult thing [indistinct words].

127
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,155
You don’t have to go to Himalayas,

128
00:09:09,356 --> 00:09:11,901
but travelling through India is not
an easy thing.

129
00:09:12,102 --> 00:09:15,672
And I had told all of you, I live with much
more conveniences

130
00:09:15,873 --> 00:09:21,599
and comforts than anyone of you live.
But I can adjust Myself much more,

131
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,047
so you should also try to forget about it.

132
00:09:24,248 --> 00:09:28,488
Don’t talk of your inconveniences. That
will make you very gross.

133
00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:36,031
The one who becomes subtler and subtler
can only achieve something.

134
00:09:37,396 --> 00:09:41,029
Today is another day, is called Bhishma
Ashtami,

135
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,650
is the day when Bhishma, who was a great
saint

136
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:52,680
who took a great vow and that vow he
carried out all his life.

137
00:09:52,881 --> 00:09:57,290
It was a great vow he took. So today
also is the day of a vow.

138
00:09:57,491 --> 00:10:00,585
He took on an Ashtami day. On the Ashtami
day he took a vow,

139
00:10:00,786 --> 00:10:05,217
 so today is another day for you to take
a vow.

140
00:10:05,418 --> 00:10:09,256
So also you should try to take a vow

141
00:10:09,457 --> 00:10:12,534
and with that vow, you should be able

142
00:10:12,735 --> 00:10:17,078
to achieve something which has not been
yet achieved.

143
00:10:24,868 --> 00:10:27,994
This achievement is not only for this
place,

144
00:10:28,182 --> 00:10:35,383
is not only for Maharashtra, it is not only
for India,

145
00:10:35,584 --> 00:10:40,666
it is not only for the whole world, but for
the whole Universe.

146
00:10:40,867 --> 00:10:46,819
So you are playing a very important,
vital role

147
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:52,982
and one should try to improve one’s
quality of life,

148
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:55,484
quality of personality.

149
00:10:55,685 --> 00:11:01,343
Unless and until you have that substantial
quality, nothing is going to work out.

150
00:11:01,544 --> 00:11:05,920
This is what I am telling them: that you
must work out

151
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:11,015
in such a way that you become substantially
dedicated to Sahaja Yoga.

152
00:11:11,216 --> 00:11:15,406
Not just for your sake, not just for your
family

153
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:18,390
or for your country, but for the whole
Universe.

154
00:11:18,591 --> 00:11:30,286
So you are the seeds who are going
to create that great atmosphere

155
00:11:30,454 --> 00:11:41,834
that will bring forth the great change that
we are expecting of Mahayoga.

156
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:49,702
It is very important to understand that
so many people have talked about this,

157
00:11:49,903 --> 00:11:53,491
and I have come across a book which was
written 2000 years back

158
00:11:53,692 --> 00:11:57,444
which describes about this Mahayoga,

159
00:11:57,645 --> 00:11:59,897
and what is going to happen. It is very
interesting.

160
00:12:00,098 --> 00:12:03,909
After the puja and havan, I think
Mr. Chauhan will translate it to you

161
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:09,015
and you can understand what it is about.
So let us start now.
