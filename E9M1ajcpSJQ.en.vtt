00:02.841 --> 00:06.260
﻿…. To sustain our Spirit, nourished.

00:11.865 --> 00:18.053
I think it is the quality of wisdom

00:19.794 --> 00:26.700
which is still lingering, or is
manifesting in many Australians,

00:30.752 --> 00:33.390
wisdom part, which many have lost

00:33.590 --> 00:41.020
because they have taken to
the gross side of materialism.

00:47.299 --> 00:52.993
Shri Ganesha is a tremendous,

00:54.687 --> 00:56.379
purifying power,

00:56.580 --> 00:58.958
tremendous purifying power,

00:59.159 --> 01:02.047
because it cannot be contaminated by anyone.

01:02.247 --> 01:05.660
Whatever you may try, it cannot be contaminated.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.980
Only thing is, it may recede back.

01:09.203 --> 01:12.563
It may not manifest.

01:13.304 --> 01:16.700
But wherever it is, it is in its absolute form.

01:17.086 --> 01:23.460
If you know how to use
it, you can purify everyone, you and yours, everyone.

01:23.660 --> 01:26.628
You and yours, everyone.

01:27.501 --> 01:33.369
So, the responsibility of Australians,
one must understand, is very great,

01:33.863 --> 01:41.540
because they are living in a
country which is ruled by Shri Ganesh,

01:42.053 --> 01:44.798
So first they have to maintain their purity.

01:45.004 --> 01:47.740
Purity of their being.

01:49.083 --> 01:54.740
Many people sometimes think that
purity is only limited to the gross side -

01:54.940 --> 02:00.351
that you lead a sensible sex
life is sufficient. It is not so.

02:00.995 --> 02:05.500
That’s why Christ has said
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”,

02:06.184 --> 02:09.540
Meaning, your eyes should be clean.

02:09.890 --> 02:14.988
And as you know, eyes
represent your ego and super-ego both.

02:15.960 --> 02:22.820
So, when He said that your eyes should be clean,

02:23.436 --> 02:29.277
He meant that your thoughts should be clean.

02:30.492 --> 02:33.700
Now, what is the generator of your power?

02:34.801 --> 02:39.907
We have to go deep into it
and see how thoughts are generated.

02:42.191 --> 02:46.340
The brain of human beings
as you know, is like a pyramid.

02:47.135 --> 02:54.740
It’s elevated to a certain point
Here in a conical way.

02:55.733 --> 02:58.540
It’s the epitome, it’s the Brahmarandhra.

03:00.535 --> 03:07.700
And when this mind

03:09.310 --> 03:12.920
elevates to that state in human beings

03:13.121 --> 03:17.500
it goes into a tremendous change of its reactions,

03:17.851 --> 03:22.460
to its environment.

03:24.056 --> 03:28.060
For example, an animal, if it sees a thing,

03:29.140 --> 03:34.945
it doesn’t think about it.
There’s no reaction created.

03:35.859 --> 03:39.500
But only in human beings this reaction takes place

03:39.952 --> 03:45.090
because of its conical brain,

03:45.291 --> 03:51.460
we can say that this attention that’s coming in,

03:51.660 --> 03:58.514
goes into a parallelogram of forces

03:58.896 --> 04:03.940
because we have two
types of densities in our brain.

04:05.235 --> 04:07.660
There is also refraction,

04:08.606 --> 04:13.577
and because of refraction this
parallelogram of forces acts in such a way

04:14.145 --> 04:16.582
that your attention goes out,

04:16.782 --> 04:22.380
and the attention that goes out, reacts.

04:23.824 --> 04:25.922
And when it reacts,

04:26.890 --> 04:30.141
the thought waves start coming in to us.

04:30.342 --> 04:32.660
You must have seen a lake.

04:33.525 --> 04:36.180
If you drop a stone in a lake,

04:36.567 --> 04:42.060
the waves start and they
come to the shores of the lake,

04:42.260 --> 04:49.300
and then it is the shore that gives
it another wave which goes back.

04:49.928 --> 04:56.100
In the same way, when
human beings look at anything,

04:56.831 --> 05:00.340
they put attention to it,

05:00.540 --> 05:04.140
there is always a reaction that comes to you.

05:06.895 --> 05:13.222
Now according to Christ, we have to have
non-adulterous eyes. There should be no adultery.

05:13.423 --> 05:16.540
The word adultery in the pure sense is not so bad.

05:16.842 --> 05:23.900
Adultery means there should not be
any mixture of what it exists, simple as that.

05:24.100 --> 05:27.660
When we say there is adulteration in the milk,

05:27.860 --> 05:32.180
we mean that it’s not purely milk
but there’s something else in it, all right.

05:32.380 --> 05:37.500
So, when you look at things - say this is a wall.

05:38.319 --> 05:42.220
A wall is a wall that’s all;
what is there to think about it?

05:43.366 --> 05:51.140
But a person who is not a realized soul
will immediately start thinking about a wall even.

05:52.713 --> 05:56.145
Now depending upon the conditioning of a person,

05:56.345 --> 06:02.020
if a person is a very perverted soul, I
don’t know what he would think of the wall

06:02.624 --> 06:08.140
because I can’t go to every limit of thinking
also-I’m sorry I have certain limitations.

06:08.570 --> 06:13.859
But a person who is say a normal person,

06:14.060 --> 06:17.300
also may start thinking about
the wall: how much it will cost

06:17.500 --> 06:20.141
and what will happen and this and that

06:20.341 --> 06:24.940
all sorts of conditionings according to the
money point of view because he is money oriented.

06:25.457 --> 06:31.140
If he is ego-oriented, then his
thoughts would go reacting that same way.

06:31.395 --> 06:34.851
This is the adulteration.
That when you look at things

06:35.196 --> 06:38.756
there is nothing to think
about. What is there to think?

06:38.956 --> 06:41.500
Whatever is, it is.

06:42.971 --> 06:46.060
But we think that by
thinking we solve the problems.

06:46.260 --> 06:49.820
Also, this kind of a myth
exists among human beings,

06:50.020 --> 06:55.100
that when you look at something or you think
about something then you solve the problem.

06:55.408 --> 06:58.260
It’s not true. It’s a myth,

06:58.729 --> 07:02.969
because thinking is just
an empty process of the mind.

07:04.201 --> 07:07.197
It’s like a wave passing toward the shore

07:07.397 --> 07:12.860
and thinks that it can just
engulf it or dissolve it completely.

07:14.504 --> 07:19.900
So, the thought is just an
empty vessel which carries nothing.

07:20.100 --> 07:26.300
It cannot do anything; it cannot
bring forth any fruit whatsoever.

07:26.809 --> 07:31.874
Sometimes this statement might look very
big and you might think: "How can that be Mother?

07:32.075 --> 07:34.995
We’ve done so much by thinking" and this and that.

07:35.242 --> 07:39.220
But you’ve not. Whatever you
have done is through spontaneity

07:39.631 --> 07:44.480
because the unconscious has helped you,
has given you the ideas, the inspiration.

07:44.826 --> 07:49.220
You have done everything through
inspiration and not by your own thinking.

07:49.572 --> 07:53.700
Now there we do not want to agree,
because we have to give up our ego

07:53.900 --> 07:57.495
because then we think we have
achieved it through our thinking.

07:58.027 --> 08:02.300
But when you think too much, too much,
too much, like that, then what happens?

08:02.500 --> 08:07.740
The unconscious gives you
the necessary information,

08:08.259 --> 08:14.380
because it has compassion, it has love for
you and suddenly you find something there.

08:14.580 --> 08:17.275
You are just pushed into
that corner where you find it.

08:17.476 --> 08:20.580
And for this, you must know,
Einstein is the person who says

08:20.780 --> 08:24.860
that the theory of relativity dawned
upon him from somewhere unknown,

08:25.060 --> 08:27.433
because whatever is known is already there.

08:27.634 --> 08:33.340
And whatever is unknown you cannot
find out by this brain which is thinking,

08:33.540 --> 08:36.508
but by the brain which is enlightened.

08:38.554 --> 08:42.420
Now when He said,
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”

08:42.737 --> 08:48.140
of course the adultery as we understand
is that we should not have lust in our eyes.

08:48.789 --> 08:51.420
But I would go still further to say

08:53.040 --> 08:56.314
that our attention has to be so pure

08:56.514 --> 09:01.132
that we should not have any return,

09:01.712 --> 09:05.619
idea of return coming to
us from a particular thing,

09:05.820 --> 09:09.420
but just enjoying it, just the joy part of it.

09:09.921 --> 09:14.020
If I see a beautiful thing,
then I am just enjoying it,

09:14.366 --> 09:18.278
not that I should possess it,
nor should I think about it,

09:18.524 --> 09:21.420
nor do I need that I should repeat it.

09:21.620 --> 09:23.900
Just enjoy it as it is.

09:24.100 --> 09:28.060
Maybe if you just enjoy it
you will just create it again.

09:28.512 --> 09:32.300
That’s the capacity one
should have of purification.

09:32.841 --> 09:39.100
So, sometimes people think that Sahaja
Yoga is a very Victorian sort of a system

09:39.300 --> 09:44.140
in which you can’t lead a life like
this and the freedom we have achieved,

09:44.341 --> 09:48.861
the abandonment we have achieved,
we cannot enjoy in Sahaja Yoga.

09:52.647 --> 09:59.220
But this virtue or this righteousness

09:59.420 --> 10:03.900
that we have condemned so
far is really the sustainer of life,

10:05.480 --> 10:09.300
is our quality, is our gold, is our wealth,

10:09.607 --> 10:12.620
is our property, is our security

10:13.327 --> 10:15.327
which we have lost.

10:16.677 --> 10:20.120
And we have to just -

10:21.303 --> 10:25.213
again have a cleansing.

10:25.412 --> 10:31.518
It is there because if it is
fundamentally eternal it cannot be lost,

10:31.774 --> 10:35.540
it cannot be permanently destroyed.

10:35.740 --> 10:40.300
It is like, you have seen a
brass metal or something like that,

10:40.500 --> 10:42.956
gets covered with atmosphere -

10:43.156 --> 10:47.020
black, red, yellow, every
sort of a colour and ruined.

10:47.220 --> 10:49.820
But again, you polish it out, it comes back.

10:50.290 --> 10:57.216
But if it is gold, it is
untarnish, it is untarnishable.

10:57.417 --> 11:04.300
But if gold is allowed to rust in the dirty,

11:06.698 --> 11:10.126
gutter or something, you cannot see it.

11:10.547 --> 11:16.580
It's covered with all kinds of things
and you think it is just finished now.

11:17.266 --> 11:21.784
It exists, all the time
our innocence exists within us.

11:22.404 --> 11:28.020
It’s not lost, it’s there, only it’s covered.
Just like the sky can be covered with clouds,

11:28.220 --> 11:30.740
it is covered now because of the atmosphere,

11:30.940 --> 11:34.279
because of the way we try to
dent it, through all kinds of things.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.618
That’s why I say don’t feel guilty,

11:36.818 --> 11:41.986
because if you feel guilty then
you have a hand which is weak,

11:42.187 --> 11:45.267
a mind which is wobbly,

11:45.960 --> 11:49.700
and then you don’t want to cleanse yourself.

11:50.257 --> 11:54.940
But it exists all the time within
us, untarnishable it exists within.

11:55.258 --> 11:57.727
You have to just get to it.

11:58.473 --> 12:01.780
Now Shri Ganesha is the
one who does that job for us.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.300
He is the one who cleanses it.

12:05.401 --> 12:09.900
That not He is the embodiment
of purity, but He does that job.

12:10.100 --> 12:15.980
Only a person, or only the Deity
which is the embodiment of purity can do it.

12:17.060 --> 12:19.220
As like you can see a soap.

12:19.467 --> 12:24.756
Soap is the one which in quality
is a pure thing and it purifies too.

12:24.957 --> 12:29.540
Supposing it is not pure,
it can become contaminated.

12:29.740 --> 12:34.031
In the same way our innocence is absolutely pure.

12:34.232 --> 12:40.540
So it is our innocence itself
cures ourselves. Just see this.

12:40.887 --> 12:44.616
The one which is lying under,
which we have always repressed,

12:44.816 --> 12:48.710
which we have undermined,
which we have not respected,

12:48.911 --> 12:53.380
comes to our help, and shines within us.

12:53.849 --> 12:59.757
It’s such a great blessing that we have
so many eternal things existing within us,

13:00.571 --> 13:04.460
otherwise human beings would
have been finished a long time back.

13:04.885 --> 13:11.740
There would have been no trace of human beings
the way they have been playing about with their chastity,

13:12.102 --> 13:17.420
with their real power of their character.

13:20.373 --> 13:27.499
So, when it is very much always impressed
in every religion that you have to lead a proper life,

13:28.365 --> 13:33.060
a sane life, the reason is
this gold that is within us

13:33.749 --> 13:38.380
must be made to shine. And
the brilliance of such a face, you can see

13:38.874 --> 13:43.020
You can see a person who
leads a very fast life, as you call it:

13:43.220 --> 13:46.100
this sallow face the sad life,

13:46.300 --> 13:52.426
and all kinds of unhappy lines on his face.

13:53.418 --> 13:59.180
But a person who starts shining one’s own being,

14:00.164 --> 14:03.500
with that wisdom

14:03.700 --> 14:08.340
and that purity beams, absolutely beams

14:08.781 --> 14:12.820
with the lustre of Shri Ganesh.

14:13.020 --> 14:17.453
The innocence of Shri Ganesh, His playfulness,

14:18.101 --> 14:25.148
His joy.. joy.. enjoying, the way He enjoys joy,

14:25.696 --> 14:30.540
the way He manifests joy. He is
the source of all the joys of the world.

14:31.033 --> 14:36.098
Now in the English language
there are no names given to joys.

14:36.299 --> 14:42.820
There is only one-word joy, and I find it
sometimes difficult to describe the different kinds of "joy"

14:43.020 --> 14:47.417
that you can have at
different levels of our evolution.

14:47.651 --> 14:52.820
But when you get to your
Sahasrara the joy is called nirananda.

14:53.730 --> 14:57.420
Now Nira is my name, you
know that. Ananda means joy.

14:57.762 --> 15:01.460
Nira means: where there is nothing else but joy.

15:01.660 --> 15:07.380
There is complete joy, no reaction,
nothing. Just submerged in joy.

15:07.917 --> 15:12.300
That quality also evolves
through the quality of Shri Ganesha.

15:12.624 --> 15:20.324
It’s the Shri Ganesha who evolves
that quality of nirananda within us.

15:20.706 --> 15:25.260
He goes into evolution gradually, as you
see up to Agnya Chakra becomes Christ.

15:26.023 --> 15:32.971
That doesn't mean that He goes into evolution,
but we can say a seed growing into that tree.

15:34.402 --> 15:40.608
And ultimately what we find is that we are
sitting on top of that tree enjoying like children.

15:41.111 --> 15:48.220
The joy that our heavenly Father
has bestowed upon us at the Sahasrara.

15:50.943 --> 15:54.260
Now the puja part of it one should understand:

15:54.674 --> 15:57.420
It is very important in Sahaja Yoga,

15:58.674 --> 16:03.928
but everybody should not be exposed to
puja to begin with, from two points of view.

16:04.210 --> 16:12.020
Sometimes the people who come to
puja actually are not really worthy of it.

16:12.418 --> 16:17.540
Not worthy of it. And then they react, they react to puja.

16:17.934 --> 16:23.700
They think: why this puja? And this
is subservient and all sorts of things,

16:24.406 --> 16:30.180
because they are not worthy of it; they have to
find out some excuse to justify their unworthiness.

16:30.380 --> 16:35.660
So, we have to first find out if
the person is worthy of puja or not.

16:35.860 --> 16:42.062
If the person is not worthy, it is better to leave
the person alone till he becomes worthy of it.

16:42.262 --> 16:49.646
because doubts and all those things can
obstruct the flow of vibrations to other people

16:49.846 --> 16:52.700
and such a person can create a problem for others.

16:53.116 --> 16:56.980
So, it is not civil of that
person also to be in the puja.

16:57.259 --> 17:03.260
If the person has not got an open
heart and an understanding of what puja is.

17:05.023 --> 17:12.300
Doing puja to any Deity as such is not
an easy thing, especially to Shri Ganesha.

17:13.428 --> 17:16.788
Those people who do puja
to Shri Ganesha should know

17:16.988 --> 17:24.988
that of course it has to be a Swayambhu,
means the one that is created by Mother Earth.

17:25.337 --> 17:27.560
No other Ganesha should be worshipped.

17:28.643 --> 17:31.860
And if they are not a realized
soul, they can never worship Shri Ganesha.

17:32.135 --> 17:36.460
They cannot even think of Him,
they cannot even take His name.

17:36.660 --> 17:39.937
It is so difficult to reach Shri Ganesha.

17:40.318 --> 17:44.620
But after realization the first thing you
have to do is to worship Shri Ganesha

17:45.724 --> 17:49.220
because that’s the basis
on which you got your realization.

17:49.420 --> 17:55.180
He’s the one first who got His crucifixion

17:55.380 --> 18:02.140
then His resurrection, and He is the one
who opened the path of realization for you.

18:02.340 --> 18:08.660
So you have to worship Him before
any other Deity. With the greatest sacrifices,

18:08.860 --> 18:16.660
The greatest evolutionary ascent He achieved
for your sake to become a human being, to die,

18:16.860 --> 18:23.020
and to suffer like a human being so that you
should not find it difficult to get your realization.

18:23.505 --> 18:27.738
Today when we say: "It’s so easy, how do you get it,"

18:27.938 --> 18:34.519
we forget that people have done a lot of
work to achieve it for you, to create the path.

18:34.719 --> 18:38.540
Like supposing I come to Perth.

18:39.051 --> 18:42.991
Say, when I was studying in
schools, I used to read the word Perth,

18:43.947 --> 18:51.900
and I couldn't not imagine that Indians could easily reach
Perth so easily from say just fly out and you are just there.

18:52.100 --> 19:00.100
But it’s possible today that we have achieved
this kind of an ascent from India to Perth so easily

19:00.671 --> 19:03.020
because people have worked for it.

19:04.045 --> 19:08.580
People have sacrificed. How many
people must have died creating an aeroplane?

19:08.901 --> 19:11.397
How many must have had
shocks and things like that?

19:11.597 --> 19:18.140
We are so privileged to use
their sacrifices for our benefit.

19:18.340 --> 19:20.180
We take it all for granted.

19:20.380 --> 19:25.337
In the same way in spiritual ascent when
we say it’s easy, it’s not so easy as you think,

19:25.538 --> 19:30.740
because it has worked out
since ages in a very deep way,

19:31.066 --> 19:34.420
and even your Mother has
worked very hard to achieve it.

19:34.620 --> 19:36.420
So, somebody has done the job.

19:36.699 --> 19:43.540
So if it is easy you should thank your stars that it’s not
difficult for you, instead of doubting it: Why is it so easy?

19:43.740 --> 19:47.380
That you want to contribute
something to it, alright you can,

19:47.580 --> 19:53.572
but first take advantage of what is available
and then you can contribute also something more to it.

19:53.773 --> 20:00.700
If you have not known an ordinary aeroplane,
how are you going to build a complicated one?

20:00.900 --> 20:06.260
So first know that whatever
is achieved in Self-Realization

20:06.460 --> 20:10.860
and the cleansing power of Shri Ganesha.

20:11.242 --> 20:18.501
Establish Shri Ganesha within you. First of all, you must establish Him, and then you can use it for others,

20:18.702 --> 20:25.486
for yourself, and for bettering and bettering
the methods of Sahaja Yoga that you have learnt.

20:25.870 --> 20:30.300
That’s how Shri Ganesha is so
important for all the Sahaja Yogis,

20:30.500 --> 20:34.620
to be understood in all its aspects.

20:35.036 --> 20:40.700
But this principle is very

20:43.305 --> 20:44.860
enormous, I should say.

20:45.060 --> 20:50.860
The principle is very
spread out. It’s very subtle.

20:51.766 --> 20:55.740
So to understand it in all its
aspects, is not an easy thing.

20:55.940 --> 21:00.500
The only thing you can do is
to become one with it, like the ocean.

21:00.700 --> 21:03.054
If you become one with the
ocean, you become the ocean.

21:03.254 --> 21:06.820
Just become one with it
and that’s how it works out.

21:07.226 --> 21:12.940
But if you use your brains to understand
it, your brain cannot even capture a wink of it.

21:13.140 --> 21:18.060
So the best thing is that you
just be humble about the whole process,

21:18.260 --> 21:20.860
just to try to become one with it.

21:21.377 --> 21:27.620
And those who can achieve that will
realize that they have become joy themselves

21:27.820 --> 21:30.740
and they have those joy-giving qualities.

21:30.940 --> 21:36.822
They have those qualities by which
they just give bliss and peace to others.

21:37.022 --> 21:42.420
Just they being there itself is
sufficient to create this feeling.

21:43.207 --> 21:46.955
I always had great hopes on Australia,

21:47.155 --> 21:55.202
and I am sure that one day it
will happen here in a big way.

21:56.549 --> 22:02.820
And when it happens here, we’ll
achieve greater results in other places.

22:03.020 --> 22:11.900
I have to work hard, and you all have to work very
hard to understand the importance of this country,

22:13.353 --> 22:16.157
your importance as Australians.

22:17.404 --> 22:22.505
Just before Puja, I would like, anyone
who has a genuine question you should to ask Me,

22:22.706 --> 22:28.780
because I don’t want that at Puja time, should
have any problems, if you have any problems...

22:44.909 --> 22:49.300
...Shri Ganesha himself is
(unclear), he is the word 'sta'.

22:49.500 --> 22:54.300
He is the one who makes you settle down,

22:56.341 --> 22:59.179
the word is 'sta' like (unclear)

22:59.380 --> 23:04.380
The one who is a householder,
is the one who stays in the house,

23:05.020 --> 23:07.861
who makes you stay or

23:09.445 --> 23:13.585
makes you.. stick.

23:13.785 --> 23:15.785
Yogi: Establish.

23:15.905 --> 23:20.008
Shri Mataji: Established,
established, established in that place.

23:22.171 --> 23:25.000
Established - I don't know...

23:25.200 --> 23:28.600
We can say it's (about).

23:32.400 --> 23:35.743
Established” means more it is very (unclear). Little closer term.

23:36.312 --> 23:39.240
...Sita.
Warren: Settled?

23:39.441 --> 23:44.441
Shri Mataji: Settled you
can say, settled.. all these

23:45.409 --> 23:51.523
Or we should say rooted, keeps
you rooted is a better word. Rooted.

23:55.214 --> 24:02.057
So, My great message to
Perth: this centre is the door.

24:02.667 --> 24:08.100
This is the door of Shri Ganesha,

24:08.906 --> 24:13.060
and you have to find out more
people who are true seekers.

24:13.410 --> 24:19.329
And don’t quarrel with people who are
doubting Sahaja Yoga, just don’t quarrel.

24:19.530 --> 24:24.380
Gradually all of them have to come
and if they don’t come don’t despair,

24:24.580 --> 24:26.746
that’s all right, that’s their luck.

24:26.947 --> 24:29.340
So, you just don’t argue on that point.

24:29.540 --> 24:31.535
Don’t waste your energy arguing with them.

24:31.735 --> 24:38.624
We have other methods of convincing
them: of giving them bandhan of,

24:43.014 --> 24:47.368
of all the nirmala vidyas that you use.

24:47.569 --> 24:53.100
So, you don’t get despaired and you don’t get
angry with them, because they’re ignorant.

24:53.300 --> 25:00.940
And you must know your past also, how
you behaved towards Sahaja Yoga in the beginning

25:01.140 --> 25:03.740
and then you will be kind to them. Be kind.

25:03.973 --> 25:06.409
Gradually everyone has to
come, those who are seekers.

25:06.610 --> 25:10.605
We’ll see that they’re all in
before we close the doors.

25:16.670 --> 25:19.370
Who do, you do the puja? Come, good.

25:49.695 --> 25:54.580
Did I give you these this
time, this is your last (unclear).

26:01.819 --> 26:04.712
This must have come from Shri Ganesh.

26:15.353 --> 26:20.229
Warren: We would have like to have
taken you to Ayres Rock this time Mother to…

26:20.479 --> 26:23.210
Shri Mataji: Yes, I would
love to see, but how far is it?

26:23.411 --> 26:29.380
Warren: It’s quite a long way and it means
one air journey to Alice Springs to the Centre

26:29.580 --> 26:35.033
and then another smaller plane to the
place, we could do it, if you wish but...

26:35.234 --> 26:37.121
Shri Mataji: Will do next year, doesn't matter.

26:37.322 --> 26:41.300
Warren: It’s such a
beautiful place full of vibrations.

26:41.500 --> 26:45.723
Shri Mataji: I’ll see photographs, we should
get some more photographs of people to see.

26:45.923 --> 26:49.138
You see, Indians, when I tell them,
they havent seen the photograph

26:49.338 --> 26:52.232
so if you could have some film or
something, they would love to see.

26:52.433 --> 26:54.914
Warren: Actually we could
put together a little exhibition.

26:55.115 --> 26:58.980
Shri Mataji: Yes, you can see the
trunk going like that, can you imagine,

26:59.180 --> 27:03.380
what more you want?
That expression of Shri Ganesh.

27:03.945 --> 27:09.250
Warren: And it’s exactly on
the parallel latitude of Chindwara.

27:09.450 --> 27:12.811
Shri Mataji: As Chindwara.
Warren: As it is North, so it is so.

27:13.012 --> 27:15.545
Shri Mataji: It's Capricorn? On the Capricorn.

27:15.745 --> 27:20.855
Warren: Exactly, not
within a few degrees but exactly!

27:21.200 --> 27:23.940
Shri Mataji: What is the latitude?

27:24.425 --> 27:30.859
Warren: Erm twenty, I've got it written and
it's 22 and a half, 23 degrees. But it's a little -

27:31.060 --> 27:33.222
Shri Mataji: And altitude?

27:36.089 --> 27:42.839
Warren: I think it’s on a plateau
about 1800 feet or something like that!

27:43.850 --> 27:46.511
Shri Mataji: What do you called?
Warren: The elevation of the hill, the moutains?

27:46.712 --> 27:50.020
Shri Mataji: You see, we have two things.
Warren: Oh longitude, sorry. Shri Mataji: Longitude.

27:50.220 --> 27:54.420
Warren: I don't know. We better
check that, does anyone have a....

27:55.905 --> 27:59.540
Shri Mataji: We should find
out what is on the other side of it!

28:50.692 --> 28:54.420
Warren: Should we begin by
saying the... Your Mantras Mother?

28:54.620 --> 28:58.609
And then shall we begin with Your
Mantras and Shri Ganesha’s Mantras.

28:58.810 --> 29:03.300
Shri Mataji: Yes, Shri Ganesha’s Mantras
is all right... sing Shri Ganesha's Mantras...

29:04.024 --> 29:05.980
washing my feet please

29:06.180 --> 29:09.260
So my feet are Shri Ganesha.

29:09.784 --> 29:13.370
The Hands are Shri Krishna.

29:14.211 --> 29:16.785
And the head is the Adi Shakti
