00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:06.260
﻿…. To sustain our Spirit, nourished.

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:18.053
I think it is the quality of wisdom

00:00:19.794 --> 00:00:26.700
which is still lingering, or is
manifesting in many Australians,

00:00:30.752 --> 00:00:33.390
wisdom part, which many have lost

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:41.020
because they have taken to
the gross side of materialism.

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:52.993
Shri Ganesha is a tremendous,

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:56.379
purifying power,

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.958
tremendous purifying power,

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.047
because it cannot be contaminated by anyone.

00:01:02.247 --> 00:01:05.660
Whatever you may try, it cannot be contaminated.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.980
Only thing is, it may recede back.

00:01:09.203 --> 00:01:12.563
It may not manifest.

00:01:13.304 --> 00:01:16.700
But wherever it is, it is in its absolute form.

00:01:17.086 --> 00:01:23.460
If you know how to use
it, you can purify everyone, you and yours, everyone.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.628
You and yours, everyone.

00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:33.369
So, the responsibility of Australians,
one must understand, is very great,

00:01:33.863 --> 00:01:41.540
because they are living in a
country which is ruled by Shri Ganesh,

00:01:42.053 --> 00:01:44.798
So first they have to maintain their purity.

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:47.740
Purity of their being.

00:01:49.083 --> 00:01:54.740
Many people sometimes think that
purity is only limited to the gross side -

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.351
that you lead a sensible sex
life is sufficient. It is not so.

00:02:00.995 --> 00:02:05.500
That’s why Christ has said
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”,

00:02:06.184 --> 00:02:09.540
Meaning, your eyes should be clean.

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.988
And as you know, eyes
represent your ego and super-ego both.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.820
So, when He said that your eyes should be clean,

00:02:23.436 --> 00:02:29.277
He meant that your thoughts should be clean.

00:02:30.492 --> 00:02:33.700
Now, what is the generator of your power?

00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:39.907
We have to go deep into it
and see how thoughts are generated.

00:02:42.191 --> 00:02:46.340
The brain of human beings
as you know, is like a pyramid.

00:02:47.135 --> 00:02:54.740
It’s elevated to a certain point
Here in a conical way.

00:02:55.733 --> 00:02:58.540
It’s the epitome, it’s the Brahmarandhra.

00:03:00.535 --> 00:03:07.700
And when this mind

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.920
elevates to that state in human beings

00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:17.500
it goes into a tremendous change of its reactions,

00:03:17.851 --> 00:03:22.460
to its environment.

00:03:24.056 --> 00:03:28.060
For example, an animal, if it sees a thing,

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.945
it doesn’t think about it.
There’s no reaction created.

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.500
But only in human beings this reaction takes place

00:03:39.952 --> 00:03:45.090
because of its conical brain,

00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:51.460
we can say that this attention that’s coming in,

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:58.514
goes into a parallelogram of forces

00:03:58.896 --> 00:04:03.940
because we have two
types of densities in our brain.

00:04:05.235 --> 00:04:07.660
There is also refraction,

00:04:08.606 --> 00:04:13.577
and because of refraction this
parallelogram of forces acts in such a way

00:04:14.145 --> 00:04:16.582
that your attention goes out,

00:04:16.782 --> 00:04:22.380
and the attention that goes out, reacts.

00:04:23.824 --> 00:04:25.922
And when it reacts,

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.141
the thought waves start coming in to us.

00:04:30.342 --> 00:04:32.660
You must have seen a lake.

00:04:33.525 --> 00:04:36.180
If you drop a stone in a lake,

00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:42.060
the waves start and they
come to the shores of the lake,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:49.300
and then it is the shore that gives
it another wave which goes back.

00:04:49.928 --> 00:04:56.100
In the same way, when
human beings look at anything,

00:04:56.831 --> 00:05:00.340
they put attention to it,

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.140
there is always a reaction that comes to you.

00:05:06.895 --> 00:05:13.222
Now according to Christ, we have to have
non-adulterous eyes. There should be no adultery.

00:05:13.423 --> 00:05:16.540
The word adultery in the pure sense is not so bad.

00:05:16.842 --> 00:05:23.900
Adultery means there should not be
any mixture of what it exists, simple as that.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.660
When we say there is adulteration in the milk,

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.180
we mean that it’s not purely milk
but there’s something else in it, all right.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.500
So, when you look at things - say this is a wall.

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:42.220
A wall is a wall that’s all;
what is there to think about it?

00:05:43.366 --> 00:05:51.140
But a person who is not a realized soul
will immediately start thinking about a wall even.

00:05:52.713 --> 00:05:56.145
Now depending upon the conditioning of a person,

00:05:56.345 --> 00:06:02.020
if a person is a very perverted soul, I
don’t know what he would think of the wall

00:06:02.624 --> 00:06:08.140
because I can’t go to every limit of thinking
also-I’m sorry I have certain limitations.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:13.859
But a person who is say a normal person,

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.300
also may start thinking about
the wall: how much it will cost

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.141
and what will happen and this and that

00:06:20.341 --> 00:06:24.940
all sorts of conditionings according to the
money point of view because he is money oriented.

00:06:25.457 --> 00:06:31.140
If he is ego-oriented, then his
thoughts would go reacting that same way.

00:06:31.395 --> 00:06:34.851
This is the adulteration.
That when you look at things

00:06:35.196 --> 00:06:38.756
there is nothing to think
about. What is there to think?

00:06:38.956 --> 00:06:41.500
Whatever is, it is.

00:06:42.971 --> 00:06:46.060
But we think that by
thinking we solve the problems.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.820
Also, this kind of a myth
exists among human beings,

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:55.100
that when you look at something or you think
about something then you solve the problem.

00:06:55.408 --> 00:06:58.260
It’s not true. It’s a myth,

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:02.969
because thinking is just
an empty process of the mind.

00:07:04.201 --> 00:07:07.197
It’s like a wave passing toward the shore

00:07:07.397 --> 00:07:12.860
and thinks that it can just
engulf it or dissolve it completely.

00:07:14.504 --> 00:07:19.900
So, the thought is just an
empty vessel which carries nothing.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:26.300
It cannot do anything; it cannot
bring forth any fruit whatsoever.

00:07:26.809 --> 00:07:31.874
Sometimes this statement might look very
big and you might think: "How can that be Mother?

00:07:32.075 --> 00:07:34.995
We’ve done so much by thinking" and this and that.

00:07:35.242 --> 00:07:39.220
But you’ve not. Whatever you
have done is through spontaneity

00:07:39.631 --> 00:07:44.480
because the unconscious has helped you,
has given you the ideas, the inspiration.

00:07:44.826 --> 00:07:49.220
You have done everything through
inspiration and not by your own thinking.

00:07:49.572 --> 00:07:53.700
Now there we do not want to agree,
because we have to give up our ego

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.495
because then we think we have
achieved it through our thinking.

00:07:58.027 --> 00:08:02.300
But when you think too much, too much,
too much, like that, then what happens?

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:07.740
The unconscious gives you
the necessary information,

00:08:08.259 --> 00:08:14.380
because it has compassion, it has love for
you and suddenly you find something there.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.275
You are just pushed into
that corner where you find it.

00:08:17.476 --> 00:08:20.580
And for this, you must know,
Einstein is the person who says

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:24.860
that the theory of relativity dawned
upon him from somewhere unknown,

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.433
because whatever is known is already there.

00:08:27.634 --> 00:08:33.340
And whatever is unknown you cannot
find out by this brain which is thinking,

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:36.508
but by the brain which is enlightened.

00:08:38.554 --> 00:08:42.420
Now when He said,
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”

00:08:42.737 --> 00:08:48.140
of course the adultery as we understand
is that we should not have lust in our eyes.

00:08:48.789 --> 00:08:51.420
But I would go still further to say

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.314
that our attention has to be so pure

00:08:56.514 --> 00:09:01.132
that we should not have any return,

00:09:01.712 --> 00:09:05.619
idea of return coming to
us from a particular thing,

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.420
but just enjoying it, just the joy part of it.

00:09:09.921 --> 00:09:14.020
If I see a beautiful thing,
then I am just enjoying it,

00:09:14.366 --> 00:09:18.278
not that I should possess it,
nor should I think about it,

00:09:18.524 --> 00:09:21.420
nor do I need that I should repeat it.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.900
Just enjoy it as it is.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:28.060
Maybe if you just enjoy it
you will just create it again.

00:09:28.512 --> 00:09:32.300
That’s the capacity one
should have of purification.

00:09:32.841 --> 00:09:39.100
So, sometimes people think that Sahaja
Yoga is a very Victorian sort of a system

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:44.140
in which you can’t lead a life like
this and the freedom we have achieved,

00:09:44.341 --> 00:09:48.861
the abandonment we have achieved,
we cannot enjoy in Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:52.647 --> 00:09:59.220
But this virtue or this righteousness

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:03.900
that we have condemned so
far is really the sustainer of life,

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.300
is our quality, is our gold, is our wealth,

00:10:09.607 --> 00:10:12.620
is our property, is our security

00:10:13.327 --> 00:10:15.327
which we have lost.

00:10:16.677 --> 00:10:20.120
And we have to just -

00:10:21.303 --> 00:10:25.213
again have a cleansing.

00:10:25.412 --> 00:10:31.518
It is there because if it is
fundamentally eternal it cannot be lost,

00:10:31.774 --> 00:10:35.540
it cannot be permanently destroyed.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:40.300
It is like, you have seen a
brass metal or something like that,

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.956
gets covered with atmosphere -

00:10:43.156 --> 00:10:47.020
black, red, yellow, every
sort of a colour and ruined.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.820
But again, you polish it out, it comes back.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:57.216
But if it is gold, it is
untarnish, it is untarnishable.

00:10:57.417 --> 00:11:04.300
But if gold is allowed to rust in the dirty,

00:11:06.698 --> 00:11:10.126
gutter or something, you cannot see it.

00:11:10.547 --> 00:11:16.580
It's covered with all kinds of things
and you think it is just finished now.

00:11:17.266 --> 00:11:21.784
It exists, all the time
our innocence exists within us.

00:11:22.404 --> 00:11:28.020
It’s not lost, it’s there, only it’s covered.
Just like the sky can be covered with clouds,

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.740
it is covered now because of the atmosphere,

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:34.279
because of the way we try to
dent it, through all kinds of things.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.618
That’s why I say don’t feel guilty,

00:11:36.818 --> 00:11:41.986
because if you feel guilty then
you have a hand which is weak,

00:11:42.187 --> 00:11:45.267
a mind which is wobbly,

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.700
and then you don’t want to cleanse yourself.

00:11:50.257 --> 00:11:54.940
But it exists all the time within
us, untarnishable it exists within.

00:11:55.258 --> 00:11:57.727
You have to just get to it.

00:11:58.473 --> 00:12:01.780
Now Shri Ganesha is the
one who does that job for us.

00:12:02.155 --> 00:12:04.300
He is the one who cleanses it.

00:12:05.401 --> 00:12:09.900
That not He is the embodiment
of purity, but He does that job.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:15.980
Only a person, or only the Deity
which is the embodiment of purity can do it.

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.220
As like you can see a soap.

00:12:19.467 --> 00:12:24.756
Soap is the one which in quality
is a pure thing and it purifies too.

00:12:24.957 --> 00:12:29.540
Supposing it is not pure,
it can become contaminated.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:34.031
In the same way our innocence is absolutely pure.

00:12:34.232 --> 00:12:40.540
So it is our innocence itself
cures ourselves. Just see this.

00:12:40.887 --> 00:12:44.616
The one which is lying under,
which we have always repressed,

00:12:44.816 --> 00:12:48.710
which we have undermined,
which we have not respected,

00:12:48.911 --> 00:12:53.380
comes to our help, and shines within us.

00:12:53.849 --> 00:12:59.757
It’s such a great blessing that we have
so many eternal things existing within us,

00:13:00.571 --> 00:13:04.460
otherwise human beings would
have been finished a long time back.

00:13:04.885 --> 00:13:11.740
There would have been no trace of human beings
the way they have been playing about with their chastity,

00:13:12.102 --> 00:13:17.420
with their real power of their character.

00:13:20.373 --> 00:13:27.499
So, when it is very much always impressed
in every religion that you have to lead a proper life,

00:13:28.365 --> 00:13:33.060
a sane life, the reason is
this gold that is within us

00:13:33.749 --> 00:13:38.380
must be made to shine. And
the brilliance of such a face, you can see

00:13:38.874 --> 00:13:43.020
You can see a person who
leads a very fast life, as you call it:

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.100
this sallow face the sad life,

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:52.426
and all kinds of unhappy lines on his face.

00:13:53.418 --> 00:13:59.180
But a person who starts shining one’s own being,

00:14:00.164 --> 00:14:03.500
with that wisdom

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:08.340
and that purity beams, absolutely beams

00:14:08.781 --> 00:14:12.820
with the lustre of Shri Ganesh.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:17.453
The innocence of Shri Ganesh, His playfulness,

00:14:18.101 --> 00:14:25.148
His joy.. joy.. enjoying, the way He enjoys joy,

00:14:25.696 --> 00:14:30.540
the way He manifests joy. He is
the source of all the joys of the world.

00:14:31.033 --> 00:14:36.098
Now in the English language
there are no names given to joys.

00:14:36.299 --> 00:14:42.820
There is only one-word joy, and I find it
sometimes difficult to describe the different kinds of "joy"

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:47.417
that you can have at
different levels of our evolution.

00:14:47.651 --> 00:14:52.820
But when you get to your
Sahasrara the joy is called nirananda.

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:57.420
Now Nira is my name, you
know that. Ananda means joy.

00:14:57.762 --> 00:15:01.460
Nira means: where there is nothing else but joy.

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:07.380
There is complete joy, no reaction,
nothing. Just submerged in joy.

00:15:07.917 --> 00:15:12.300
That quality also evolves
through the quality of Shri Ganesha.

00:15:12.624 --> 00:15:20.324
It’s the Shri Ganesha who evolves
that quality of nirananda within us.

00:15:20.706 --> 00:15:25.260
He goes into evolution gradually, as you
see up to Agnya Chakra becomes Christ.

00:15:26.023 --> 00:15:32.971
That doesn't mean that He goes into evolution,
but we can say a seed growing into that tree.

00:15:34.402 --> 00:15:40.608
And ultimately what we find is that we are
sitting on top of that tree enjoying like children.

00:15:41.111 --> 00:15:48.220
The joy that our heavenly Father
has bestowed upon us at the Sahasrara.

00:15:50.943 --> 00:15:54.260
Now the puja part of it one should understand:

00:15:54.674 --> 00:15:57.420
It is very important in Sahaja Yoga,

00:15:58.674 --> 00:16:03.928
but everybody should not be exposed to
puja to begin with, from two points of view.

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:12.020
Sometimes the people who come to
puja actually are not really worthy of it.

00:16:12.418 --> 00:16:17.540
Not worthy of it. And then they react, they react to puja.

00:16:17.934 --> 00:16:23.700
They think: why this puja? And this
is subservient and all sorts of things,

00:16:24.406 --> 00:16:30.180
because they are not worthy of it; they have to
find out some excuse to justify their unworthiness.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:35.660
So, we have to first find out if
the person is worthy of puja or not.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:42.062
If the person is not worthy, it is better to leave
the person alone till he becomes worthy of it.

00:16:42.262 --> 00:16:49.646
because doubts and all those things can
obstruct the flow of vibrations to other people

00:16:49.846 --> 00:16:52.700
and such a person can create a problem for others.

00:16:53.116 --> 00:16:56.980
So, it is not civil of that
person also to be in the puja.

00:16:57.259 --> 00:17:03.260
If the person has not got an open
heart and an understanding of what puja is.

00:17:05.023 --> 00:17:12.300
Doing puja to any Deity as such is not
an easy thing, especially to Shri Ganesha.

00:17:13.428 --> 00:17:16.788
Those people who do puja
to Shri Ganesha should know

00:17:16.988 --> 00:17:24.988
that of course it has to be a Swayambhu,
means the one that is created by Mother Earth.

00:17:25.337 --> 00:17:27.560
No other Ganesha should be worshipped.

00:17:28.643 --> 00:17:31.860
And if they are not a realized
soul, they can never worship Shri Ganesha.

00:17:32.135 --> 00:17:36.460
They cannot even think of Him,
they cannot even take His name.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:39.937
It is so difficult to reach Shri Ganesha.

00:17:40.318 --> 00:17:44.620
But after realization the first thing you
have to do is to worship Shri Ganesha

00:17:45.724 --> 00:17:49.220
because that’s the basis
on which you got your realization.

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:55.180
He’s the one first who got His crucifixion

00:17:55.380 --> 00:18:02.140
then His resurrection, and He is the one
who opened the path of realization for you.

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:08.660
So you have to worship Him before
any other Deity. With the greatest sacrifices,

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:16.660
The greatest evolutionary ascent He achieved
for your sake to become a human being, to die,

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:23.020
and to suffer like a human being so that you
should not find it difficult to get your realization.

00:18:23.505 --> 00:18:27.738
Today when we say: "It’s so easy, how do you get it,"

00:18:27.938 --> 00:18:34.519
we forget that people have done a lot of
work to achieve it for you, to create the path.

00:18:34.719 --> 00:18:38.540
Like supposing I come to Perth.

00:18:39.051 --> 00:18:42.991
Say, when I was studying in
schools, I used to read the word Perth,

00:18:43.947 --> 00:18:51.900
and I couldn't not imagine that Indians could easily reach
Perth so easily from say just fly out and you are just there.

00:18:52.100 --> 00:19:00.100
But it’s possible today that we have achieved
this kind of an ascent from India to Perth so easily

00:19:00.671 --> 00:19:03.020
because people have worked for it.

00:19:04.045 --> 00:19:08.580
People have sacrificed. How many
people must have died creating an aeroplane?

00:19:08.901 --> 00:19:11.397
How many must have had
shocks and things like that?

00:19:11.597 --> 00:19:18.140
We are so privileged to use
their sacrifices for our benefit.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.180
We take it all for granted.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:25.337
In the same way in spiritual ascent when
we say it’s easy, it’s not so easy as you think,

00:19:25.538 --> 00:19:30.740
because it has worked out
since ages in a very deep way,

00:19:31.066 --> 00:19:34.420
and even your Mother has
worked very hard to achieve it.

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.420
So, somebody has done the job.

00:19:36.699 --> 00:19:43.540
So if it is easy you should thank your stars that it’s not
difficult for you, instead of doubting it: Why is it so easy?

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:47.380
That you want to contribute
something to it, alright you can,

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:53.572
but first take advantage of what is available
and then you can contribute also something more to it.

00:19:53.773 --> 00:20:00.700
If you have not known an ordinary aeroplane,
how are you going to build a complicated one?

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:06.260
So first know that whatever
is achieved in Self-Realization

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:10.860
and the cleansing power of Shri Ganesha.

00:20:11.242 --> 00:20:18.501
Establish Shri Ganesha within you. First of all, you must establish Him, and then you can use it for others,

00:20:18.702 --> 00:20:25.486
for yourself, and for bettering and bettering
the methods of Sahaja Yoga that you have learnt.

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:30.300
That’s how Shri Ganesha is so
important for all the Sahaja Yogis,

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:34.620
to be understood in all its aspects.

00:20:35.036 --> 00:20:40.700
But this principle is very

00:20:43.305 --> 00:20:44.860
enormous, I should say.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:50.860
The principle is very
spread out. It’s very subtle.

00:20:51.766 --> 00:20:55.740
So to understand it in all its
aspects, is not an easy thing.

00:20:55.940 --> 00:21:00.500
The only thing you can do is
to become one with it, like the ocean.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:03.054
If you become one with the
ocean, you become the ocean.

00:21:03.254 --> 00:21:06.820
Just become one with it
and that’s how it works out.

00:21:07.226 --> 00:21:12.940
But if you use your brains to understand
it, your brain cannot even capture a wink of it.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:18.060
So the best thing is that you
just be humble about the whole process,

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.860
just to try to become one with it.

00:21:21.377 --> 00:21:27.620
And those who can achieve that will
realize that they have become joy themselves

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.740
and they have those joy-giving qualities.

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:36.822
They have those qualities by which
they just give bliss and peace to others.

00:21:37.022 --> 00:21:42.420
Just they being there itself is
sufficient to create this feeling.

00:21:43.207 --> 00:21:46.955
I always had great hopes on Australia,

00:21:47.155 --> 00:21:55.202
and I am sure that one day it
will happen here in a big way.

00:21:56.549 --> 00:22:02.820
And when it happens here, we’ll
achieve greater results in other places.

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:11.900
I have to work hard, and you all have to work very
hard to understand the importance of this country,

00:22:13.353 --> 00:22:16.157
your importance as Australians.

00:22:17.404 --> 00:22:22.505
Just before Puja, I would like, anyone
who has a genuine question you should to ask Me,

00:22:22.706 --> 00:22:28.780
because I don’t want that at Puja time, should
have any problems, if you have any problems...

00:22:44.909 --> 00:22:49.300
...Shri Ganesha himself is
(unclear), he is the word 'sta'.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:54.300
He is the one who makes you settle down,

00:22:56.341 --> 00:22:59.179
the word is 'sta' like (unclear)

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:04.380
The one who is a householder,
is the one who stays in the house,

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.861
who makes you stay or

00:23:09.445 --> 00:23:13.585
makes you.. stick.

00:23:13.785 --> 00:23:15.785
Yogi: Establish.

00:23:15.905 --> 00:23:20.008
Shri Mataji: Established,
established, established in that place.

00:23:22.171 --> 00:23:25.000
Established - I don't know...

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.600
We can say it's (about).

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.743
Established” means more it is very (unclear). Little closer term.

00:23:36.312 --> 00:23:39.240
...Sita.
Warren: Settled?

00:23:39.441 --> 00:23:44.441
Shri Mataji: Settled you
can say, settled.. all these

00:23:45.409 --> 00:23:51.523
Or we should say rooted, keeps
you rooted is a better word. Rooted.

00:23:55.214 --> 00:24:02.057
So, My great message to
Perth: this centre is the door.

00:24:02.667 --> 00:24:08.100
This is the door of Shri Ganesha,

00:24:08.906 --> 00:24:13.060
and you have to find out more
people who are true seekers.

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:19.329
And don’t quarrel with people who are
doubting Sahaja Yoga, just don’t quarrel.

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:24.380
Gradually all of them have to come
and if they don’t come don’t despair,

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:26.746
that’s all right, that’s their luck.

00:24:26.947 --> 00:24:29.340
So, you just don’t argue on that point.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.535
Don’t waste your energy arguing with them.

00:24:31.735 --> 00:24:38.624
We have other methods of convincing
them: of giving them bandhan of,

00:24:43.014 --> 00:24:47.368
of all the nirmala vidyas that you use.

00:24:47.569 --> 00:24:53.100
So, you don’t get despaired and you don’t get
angry with them, because they’re ignorant.

00:24:53.300 --> 00:25:00.940
And you must know your past also, how
you behaved towards Sahaja Yoga in the beginning

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:03.740
and then you will be kind to them. Be kind.

00:25:03.973 --> 00:25:06.409
Gradually everyone has to
come, those who are seekers.

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:10.605
We’ll see that they’re all in
before we close the doors.

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:19.370
Who do, you do the puja? Come, good.

00:25:49.695 --> 00:25:54.580
Did I give you these this
time, this is your last (unclear).

00:26:01.819 --> 00:26:04.712
This must have come from Shri Ganesh.

00:26:15.353 --> 00:26:20.229
Warren: We would have like to have
taken you to Ayres Rock this time Mother to…

00:26:20.479 --> 00:26:23.210
Shri Mataji: Yes, I would
love to see, but how far is it?

00:26:23.411 --> 00:26:29.380
Warren: It’s quite a long way and it means
one air journey to Alice Springs to the Centre

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:35.033
and then another smaller plane to the
place, we could do it, if you wish but...

00:26:35.234 --> 00:26:37.121
Shri Mataji: Will do next year, doesn't matter.

00:26:37.322 --> 00:26:41.300
Warren: It’s such a
beautiful place full of vibrations.

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:45.723
Shri Mataji: I’ll see photographs, we should
get some more photographs of people to see.

00:26:45.923 --> 00:26:49.138
You see, Indians, when I tell them,
they havent seen the photograph

00:26:49.338 --> 00:26:52.232
so if you could have some film or
something, they would love to see.

00:26:52.433 --> 00:26:54.914
Warren: Actually we could
put together a little exhibition.

00:26:55.115 --> 00:26:58.980
Shri Mataji: Yes, you can see the
trunk going like that, can you imagine,

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:03.380
what more you want?
That expression of Shri Ganesh.

00:27:03.945 --> 00:27:09.250
Warren: And it’s exactly on
the parallel latitude of Chindwara.

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:12.811
Shri Mataji: As Chindwara.
Warren: As it is North, so it is so.

00:27:13.012 --> 00:27:15.545
Shri Mataji: It's Capricorn? On the Capricorn.

00:27:15.745 --> 00:27:20.855
Warren: Exactly, not
within a few degrees but exactly!

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.940
Shri Mataji: What is the latitude?

00:27:24.425 --> 00:27:30.859
Warren: Erm twenty, I've got it written and
it's 22 and a half, 23 degrees. But it's a little -

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:33.222
Shri Mataji: And altitude?

00:27:36.089 --> 00:27:42.839
Warren: I think it’s on a plateau
about 1800 feet or something like that!

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:46.511
Shri Mataji: What do you called?
Warren: The elevation of the hill, the moutains?

00:27:46.712 --> 00:27:50.020
Shri Mataji: You see, we have two things.
Warren: Oh longitude, sorry. Shri Mataji: Longitude.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:54.420
Warren: I don't know. We better
check that, does anyone have a....

00:27:55.905 --> 00:27:59.540
Shri Mataji: We should find
out what is on the other side of it!

00:28:50.692 --> 00:28:54.420
Warren: Should we begin by
saying the... Your Mantras Mother?

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:58.609
And then shall we begin with Your
Mantras and Shri Ganesha’s Mantras.

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:03.300
Shri Mataji: Yes, Shri Ganesha’s Mantras
is all right... sing Shri Ganesha's Mantras...

00:29:04.024 --> 00:29:05.980
washing my feet please

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:09.260
So my feet are Shri Ganesha.

00:29:09.784 --> 00:29:13.370
The Hands are Shri Krishna.

00:29:14.211 --> 00:29:16.785
And the head is the Adi Shakti
