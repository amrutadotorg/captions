00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:00,880
Public Program  25 April 2001
 Lütfi Kirdar Congress Palace, Istanbul (Turkey)

2
00:00:57,146 --> 00:01:01,873
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

3
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,222
I have been coming to Turkey in the last ten years.

4
00:01:19,087 --> 00:01:27,012
And I found this place is so much filled with spirituality.

5
00:01:32,775 --> 00:01:36,622
 Perhaps we have had so many Sufis here,

6
00:01:38,711 --> 00:01:44,598
must be something in this country
is that there were so many Sufis were created.

7
00:01:51,367 --> 00:01:56,316
And I have read about them and
I have read about Rumi and all others.

8
00:01:56,506 --> 00:02:02,690
 And I find they described the qualities of a Sufi

9
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:07,069
 the state of his mind, very beautiful.

10
00:02:26,373 --> 00:02:31,001
But they didn't say how created, how to became Sufis.

11
00:02:36,702 --> 00:02:42,214
They described of course  very well
and absolutely  truthfully

12
00:02:42,476 --> 00:02:46,375
 whatever was the achievement.

13
00:02:55,524 --> 00:03:00,098
But nobody could say that how they achieved it.

14
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:14,512
Even in the Kuran you see how Muhammed Sahab has described

15
00:03:14,703 --> 00:03:21,092
 that he went through seventh heavens  on a white horse.

16
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:34,502
 He was a poet and the whole thing was so poetic.

17
00:03:39,756 --> 00:03:42,749
The white horse was this Kundalini.

18
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,178
 The more you will know about Kundalini
you will see how poetically

19
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:56,147
He had described all these seven heavens he crossed over.

20
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,904
So, unless and until you are self realized soul

21
00:04:17,246 --> 00:04:19,912
as he has said "know thy self".

22
00:04:20,062 --> 00:04:25,863
Unless and until you know your self
you can not understand any one of this scriptures.

23
00:04:42,124 --> 00:04:48,351
They say, all of them say the same thing
in different ways and also in poetry.

24
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:03,413
And it is difficult for common people to understand.

25
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:18,956
In no way there is difference in the
 explanations of all these scriptures,

26
00:05:19,076 --> 00:05:21,734
they are just the same.

27
00:05:32,304 --> 00:05:35,896
Then there is no question of people fighting

28
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:39,935
because there is no difference  what they are fighting for.

29
00:05:50,122 --> 00:05:56,944
But  problem was one individual gets the self realization

30
00:05:57,188 --> 00:06:01,652
and the others don’t understand
 they torture that person.

31
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:16,843
As you know Christ was crucified

32
00:06:16,956 --> 00:06:21,244
and all the saints, all the sages were tortured.

33
00:06:32,078 --> 00:06:36,619
Even in China there was this Tao.

34
00:06:36,762 --> 00:06:39,620
It was the same thing as Sahaja Yoga

35
00:06:39,756 --> 00:06:43,425
but it was written in such a manner

36
00:06:43,492 --> 00:06:49,606
that people could not understand it or
I think couldn't take it what it was written.

37
00:07:00,406 --> 00:07:10,786
Also I find in Japan,Vidittama is a deciple of
(mahatma welcome book.Gautam Budda)

38
00:07:11,153 --> 00:07:14,051
He said the same things,

39
00:07:14,187 --> 00:07:18,830
he tried to practice Sahaja Yoga through
various methods

40
00:07:18,975 --> 00:07:23,320
all was nothing but Kundalini awakening.

41
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:55,606
Now the thing is of understanding
then go to any limit of stupitidies.

42
00:08:04,712 --> 00:08:09,952
There was a great poet called Kabir in India

43
00:08:16,174 --> 00:08:21,417
and whatever he told was so much
 misunderstood by people

44
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:27,700
that you can not imagine
 what interpretations they do.

45
00:08:39,907 --> 00:08:48,051
He says in one  poetry that my beloved
went away and  I  did not  cry.

46
00:08:57,605 --> 00:09:01,706
Now people think beloved means a lover.

47
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:06,638
It is what he was meaning was a life  life went away.

48
00:09:06,741 --> 00:09:09,598
But, I did not cry,   I didn't say anything.

49
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:24,254
So he was saying about the death

50
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:30,237
 while people all these thinks it is some sort of
a beloved he is talking about.

51
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,921
Thus you see, we have problems, of people fighting

52
00:09:45,946 --> 00:09:50,882
 who said they are fighting is a name of religion.

53
00:10:00,612 --> 00:10:06,554
To understand they have  first you take your self realization.

54
00:10:12,705 --> 00:10:15,223
You have to know yourself.

55
00:10:15,953 --> 00:10:18,997
Unless and until you know yourself

56
00:10:19,022 --> 00:10:24,082
how will you understand the subtle ideas they want to look forward.

57
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:43,066
So whatever they have told you about
 the Kundalini it is a fact,

58
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:47,844
it is a fact and  resides within you in the triangular bone.

59
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:04,959
You could be a Muslim you could be a Hindu
you could be a Christian anything.

60
00:11:05,571 --> 00:11:09,001
Even people from Africa came.

61
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:13,198
They were black, some were white, some were yellow,

62
00:11:13,243 --> 00:11:17,584
all of them have got this Kundalini within them.

63
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:35,478
As  God has created us the same.

64
00:11:35,521 --> 00:11:42,833
we all have noses, hands everything,
 everywhere whatever languages we may speak.

65
00:11:52,681 --> 00:11:57,921
Now, Sahaja means, saha means "with" and ja  "born with you".

66
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:03,582
The right to get this yoga, union with the divine, the ruh.

67
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:19,787
You all have this right

68
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:22,571
and now it is going to work out

69
00:12:22,596 --> 00:12:27,142
that you have to know yourself through the Kundalini awakening.

70
00:12:39,334 --> 00:12:43,802
All this may be not written in those books.

71
00:12:43,827 --> 00:12:46,429
Perhaps that was not the time to write

72
00:12:46,468 --> 00:12:51,340
or maybe these books were written after long time

73
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:54,915
 after the prophet went away, Christ die in all that.

74
00:12:54,935 --> 00:12:58,451
So there are certain sacrifice you see.

75
00:13:14,516 --> 00:13:21,526
But it is a fact that, you whole have,
all of you have this power within you,

76
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:26,150
this energy within you which we call as Kundalini.

77
00:13:35,988 --> 00:13:37,812
It has been proved now

78
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:41,242
because wherever I have gone many countries

79
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:46,232
various type of people were there
 and they all got their realization.

80
00:13:55,814 --> 00:14:00,459
Especially in Turkey is a very dear country to me

81
00:14:00,494 --> 00:14:04,757
because of so many people who were here

82
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:09,489
and  who  were  spiritually so equipped

83
00:14:09,638 --> 00:14:14,123
they might call themselves  as Sufis,
 I mean Sufi means [UNCLEAR].

84
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,840
So it cleanses, means this Kundalini rising

85
00:14:30,915 --> 00:14:35,710
 cleanses you of your problems, of your enemies.

86
00:14:48,911 --> 00:14:51,331
Because it connects you

87
00:14:51,585 --> 00:14:55,550
to the all pervading power which we call as Ruh

88
00:14:55,621 --> 00:15:01,926
and all your personality absolutely
get absorbed with the truth.

89
00:15:17,977 --> 00:15:22,894
The first thing that happens to you when she rises,

90
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:28,978
sometimes it is you just  become thoughtlessly aware.

91
00:15:40,396 --> 00:15:44,713
The thoughts come to us because we react.

92
00:15:44,973 --> 00:15:49,020
We see something immediately we react.

93
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:06,094
We react according to our ego or maybe
 according to our conditioning.

94
00:16:14,568 --> 00:16:19,822
But when the Kundalini she rises and
crosses this center upward

95
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,563
then your thoughts stop.

96
00:16:35,547 --> 00:16:38,003
Then you become a witness.

97
00:16:38,051 --> 00:16:41,227
You witness without thinking.

98
00:16:50,245 --> 00:16:53,166
Thought  rises then falls

99
00:16:53,191 --> 00:16:57,027
 then another thought comes up, rises and falls.

100
00:17:06,157 --> 00:17:09,746
There is a space, very little space in between

101
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,393
but we cannot see that space,

102
00:17:12,426 --> 00:17:15,100
we can not in there  that space.

103
00:17:26,204 --> 00:17:32,000
Now these thoughts who are all the time [UNCLEAR]
hoovering  in your head

104
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:34,962
and our  mind cruise or jumping on them

105
00:17:35,005 --> 00:17:38,292
doesn’t allow us to be in the present

106
00:17:38,317 --> 00:17:42,201
because they come from the past and from the future.

107
00:18:02,236 --> 00:18:06,521
So we cannot be in the present.

108
00:18:10,729 --> 00:18:15,539
Past is finished it does not exist
and the future is no more,

109
00:18:15,702 --> 00:18:20,537
so what we have to do is to stay in the present.

110
00:18:32,787 --> 00:18:36,554
And in the present is the reality, is the truth.

111
00:18:42,441 --> 00:18:45,538
That is how we can not enjoying.

112
00:18:50,617 --> 00:18:55,180
For example, I see a very beautiful carpet here,
very beautiful

113
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,589
and I start reacting on it

114
00:18:57,622 --> 00:19:03,071
and then I start thinking of how much is that  cost,

115
00:19:03,177 --> 00:19:06,004
can I have it, all things is possible.

116
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,557
but I can not watch it.

117
00:19:23,468 --> 00:19:25,507
Because I can not watch it

118
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:30,193
the joy that  is put by the artist  in the sight
I can not enjoy it.

119
00:19:41,795 --> 00:19:43,965
So when this Kundalini rises

120
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:50,124
what she does,  she elongates those toughts
 there is a space   between a  thought.

121
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:06,976
So we can see everything without thinking and enjoy fully.

122
00:20:17,178 --> 00:20:20,556
And with this enjoyment we get peace,

123
00:20:20,581 --> 00:20:22,591
complete peace.

124
00:20:31,545 --> 00:20:35,227
We do not agress others, we enjoy others.

125
00:20:44,468 --> 00:20:47,152
They have  many peace conferences

126
00:20:47,177 --> 00:20:51,273
but those who are having the conference have no peace within –

127
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:54,196
then what is the use of having the conference?

128
00:21:05,702 --> 00:21:09,387
We have six enemies within us at least

129
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,008
which are all the time torturing us.

130
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:24,373
They are described in the Sanskrit language very beautifully

131
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:26,806
but I will tell them, that's now [UNCLEAR].

132
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,185
First is the anger.

133
00:21:41,996 --> 00:21:44,436
That is so common,

134
00:21:44,461 --> 00:21:47,478
 comes out of  so much of conditioning

135
00:21:47,503 --> 00:21:49,830
may be so much of ego.

136
00:21:59,144 --> 00:22:01,415
Then the perversion,

137
00:22:01,447 --> 00:22:08,189
perversion of sex or
 all kinds of dirty things people do it.

138
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:19,921
Then we have false pride,

139
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,527
now we have jealousy

140
00:22:32,413 --> 00:22:34,661
we have attachments.

141
00:22:38,414 --> 00:22:41,906
People are corrupt because
they are attached to their children,

142
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:45,719
they want to make money for them,
so  they are corrupt.

143
00:22:58,532 --> 00:23:00,285
And we have  also attraction.

144
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:04,239
We are attracted supposing somebody is attracted,

145
00:23:04,256 --> 00:23:09,291
  say towards good clothes somebody attracted or good house

146
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:11,467
attractions.

147
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,368
We cannot explain.

148
00:23:31,433 --> 00:23:34,400
We cannot explain why we do that.

149
00:23:39,492 --> 00:23:43,423
Why we suffer from all these enemies we don't know.

150
00:23:49,022 --> 00:23:53,554
Once you become the spirit,

151
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:57,080
spirit drops out everything,

152
00:23:57,093 --> 00:23:59,960
it is so clear, so clean,

153
00:23:59,985 --> 00:24:04,538
and  what is the spirit is the reflection of God in our heart.

154
00:24:20,623 --> 00:24:23,551
The spirit , that is within you.

155
00:24:23,576 --> 00:24:29,557
once it  enlightens you, you become such a wonderful person,

156
00:24:29,589 --> 00:24:34,502
such a nice person and you develop this spirituality.

157
00:24:47,525 --> 00:24:51,429
What, actually what happens is

158
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,979
that when  Kundalini rises

159
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:58,755
your spirit starts emitting vibrations

160
00:24:58,811 --> 00:25:03,503
spiritual vibrations on your central nervous system.

161
00:25:15,767 --> 00:25:21,284
And you start feeling cool breeze on your hands

162
00:25:21,366 --> 00:25:24,153
out of your fontanel bone area.

163
00:25:37,865 --> 00:25:42,336
And then this  fingers which represent

164
00:25:42,447 --> 00:25:47,249
the centers within you  starts speaking telling you
 what's wrong and what's kind.

165
00:26:03,616 --> 00:26:09,031
Also they tell you about others,
what is wrong with the others.

166
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:21,965
This connection with the divine
gives you this blessing

167
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:25,633
that you  know what is wrong with you
and what is wrong with others.

168
00:26:40,112 --> 00:26:42,663
Even the doctors will not tell you,

169
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:47,014
nobody can tell you, just now on your fingertips

170
00:26:57,925 --> 00:27:03,568
So in the Kuran it says at the time of kıyam
 your hands will speak.

171
00:27:11,393 --> 00:27:15,345
So this is the kiyam time, kiyamat is different.

172
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:17,594
[UNCLEAR]

173
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:19,182
Kıyamat and kıyama

174
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:28,705
Kyam because this is the last judgement.

175
00:27:33,436 --> 00:27:39,080
Those who do not accept their self realisation,

176
00:27:39,173 --> 00:27:45,825
and who don't get into the heavenly bliss of divinity,

177
00:27:45,906 --> 00:27:50,472
they go to hell – that is the wisdom.

178
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:05,255
So, for you it is important that your hands must speak

179
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,059
and tell you about you and others.

180
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:22,058
That is how you are mussulman, otherwise you are not.

181
00:28:28,496 --> 00:28:31,220
If your hands do not speak

182
00:28:31,245 --> 00:28:34,311
than you are not a mussulman in surrendering.

183
00:28:41,527 --> 00:28:44,594
It`s all said, it is all written in the Quran

184
00:28:44,614 --> 00:28:49,417
but once you be  able to read it after
you have got your realization.

185
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:03,020
It is high time that you should realize

186
00:29:03,052 --> 00:29:06,625
that we  have been following something so much

187
00:29:06,658 --> 00:29:09,111
and why is it we are in trouble,

188
00:29:09,151 --> 00:29:14,230
why we have not been able to achieve whatever is promised.

189
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:31,179
It is something missing

190
00:29:31,212 --> 00:29:34,858
that so far we have not been able to

191
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:37,352
achieve what is doing promised.

192
00:30:01,816 --> 00:30:05,197
You all can have your self realization.

193
00:30:09,054 --> 00:30:13,403
Don’t have any fear about it and some

194
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:16,382
sort of funny ideas about it.

195
00:30:23,867 --> 00:30:28,215
Because whatever will happen, you will feel it.

196
00:30:34,872 --> 00:30:37,324
It`s not something imaginary.

197
00:30:41,709 --> 00:30:43,812
It’s the actualization.

198
00:30:47,706 --> 00:30:52,105
To the Christians I say this actualization of  baptism.

199
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:05,713
So, it's your chance now all of you so many have  come

200
00:31:05,785 --> 00:31:08,158
to have that self realization.

201
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:21,805
It was prophesied that it will happen collectively.

202
00:31:28,073 --> 00:31:30,461
And so, you all deserve it.

203
00:31:30,486 --> 00:31:32,152
And you should have it.

204
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:35,214
Because İt is what  is promised.

205
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,325
So ultimately what happens

206
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:49,320
that you jump in the ocean of joy.

207
00:31:55,842 --> 00:31:58,739
You become powerfull.

208
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,736
But you don't have ego.

209
00:32:05,856 --> 00:32:10,454
And you know how you get help others

210
00:32:10,487 --> 00:32:13,740
and yourself and help the family.

211
00:32:22,693 --> 00:32:24,494
All of you can get  it.

212
00:32:28,215 --> 00:32:34,741
I mean those who want can all get it ,
 it can't be forced [UNCLEAR].

213
00:32:42,813 --> 00:32:49,943
Thus you will know what you are and also what othes are.

214
00:32:58,485 --> 00:33:02,119
Many people have  been cured in sahaja yoga, no doubt.

215
00:33:02,207 --> 00:33:05,262
We also have a hospital in India.

216
00:33:15,503 --> 00:33:20,844
Where people are cured without any medicine
 with their own vibrations.

217
00:33:30,403 --> 00:33:35,879
Moreover mentally there are so many people
 who have been cured.

218
00:33:43,192 --> 00:33:45,725
And your problems are solved.

219
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:50,352
Because you get out  of your problems.

220
00:33:57,771 --> 00:34:03,842
Will be amazed how miraculously
 you achieve such small small things

221
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:06,901
which really look great [UNCLEAR] to begin with.

222
00:34:17,011 --> 00:34:21,828
Every human being has a right  to get self realization.

223
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:33,080
All negative forces and energies  just
drop out and run away.

224
00:34:41,235 --> 00:34:46,520
Just like whether light comes in all darkness goes away.

225
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:54,843
It sometimes  people don't believe.

226
00:34:54,868 --> 00:34:59,585
Because, they don't think they are
 capable of getting self realization.

227
00:35:10,165 --> 00:35:14,633
But, I am sure tonight you will learn what you are.

228
00:35:21,454 --> 00:35:26,501
Will be absolutely relaxed person and

229
00:35:26,533 --> 00:35:31,453
the whole being  will be filled with joy and divine love.

230
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:46,525
It's not because of me, it's because of you.

231
00:35:51,604 --> 00:36:00,408
You have once you have what only
 I have to open the window here.

232
00:36:07,822 --> 00:36:11,211
That to you do because It is your desire,

233
00:36:11,251 --> 00:36:15,046
to become your pure desire to be.

234
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:27,460
Otherwise no other desire is pure.

235
00:36:32,527 --> 00:36:39,177
All economics is based on one point
 that no human desire is complete.

236
00:36:49,761 --> 00:36:54,443
Today you want  to have one thing then
 you want to have another thing.

237
00:36:59,604 --> 00:37:03,286
And you are never satisfied.

238
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:09,059
But this  is pure desire.

239
00:37:09,324 --> 00:37:15,126
Kundalini is the energy of pure desire
 because the desire of our Almighty

240
00:37:23,654 --> 00:37:27,466
So, when you get your realization,

241
00:37:27,526 --> 00:37:33,319
you feel absolutely satisfied and
enjoy whatever you have.

242
00:37:43,888 --> 00:37:48,484
And also you enjoy others and their things

243
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:52,700
without thinking that they don't belong to you.

244
00:38:06,276 --> 00:38:08,887
The whole panorama changes

245
00:38:08,895 --> 00:38:14,950
and you become a very universal personality.

246
00:38:22,364 --> 00:38:25,110
You really become global

247
00:38:25,198 --> 00:38:30,547
and everybody who is in sahaja yoga are such great friends.

248
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:49,389
I'll give an example that
 Palestinians were fighting Israelis

249
00:38:49,542 --> 00:38:54,211
and one of the Israeli fellow, telephoned  to me

250
00:38:54,272 --> 00:39:01,518
that Mother we have some Sahaja Yogis
 in  the  one of the villages of  Palestine.

251
00:39:14,235 --> 00:39:19,804
They were friends,  despite the fact that
[UNCLEAR] is fighting, countries were fighting.

252
00:39:19,845 --> 00:39:23,548
But they were Sahaja Yogis,
 so they were friends they are friends.

253
00:39:38,522 --> 00:39:44,730
So this Israilian knew that
 they are going to drop a big bomb

254
00:39:44,794 --> 00:39:49,376
in a particular village and he told me that
please pay  attention Mother

255
00:39:49,417 --> 00:39:52,094
 I don't want  people to be killed  there.

256
00:40:06,078 --> 00:40:11,284
I give pay attention and they never drop the bomb.

257
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:21,122
Love is the most powerful thing human beings have all.

258
00:40:27,335 --> 00:40:29,763
We have never used it.

259
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:35,034
We have always use hatred to over power others.

260
00:40:42,998 --> 00:40:46,775
We have never used love.

261
00:40:50,452 --> 00:40:56,191
There is divine love allover  allover the world
 that's why we are existing .

262
00:41:02,663 --> 00:41:06,408
You have to just become one within that's all.

263
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:16,972
It's allover, it is called Ruh , It's allover.

264
00:41:16,997 --> 00:41:19,450
But we have not yet felt.

265
00:41:27,419 --> 00:41:31,879
But today is now, you have the time to feel it.

266
00:41:37,631 --> 00:41:41,099
For that you don’t have to concentrate or do anything,

267
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:43,639
it will  just work automatically.

268
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:56,381
Have faith in yourself.

269
00:41:59,007 --> 00:42:01,769
Do not condemn yourself.

270
00:42:06,992 --> 00:42:09,341
This will change the whole world.

271
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:13,594
Once they realize that there is divine love
 which [UNCLEAR] us.

272
00:42:25,616 --> 00:42:29,290
So, the first state is thoughtless awareness

273
00:42:29,323 --> 00:42:36,787
and the second state  is what we called
 as the doubtless awareness.

274
00:42:52,351 --> 00:42:55,818
That state comes to people automatically

275
00:42:55,827 --> 00:43:00,196
sometimes together and they have no doubts about it.

276
00:43:09,558 --> 00:43:11,645
It works that way.

277
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:17,338
 It doesn't give you any doubts anymore
 you are sure this is what it is.

278
00:43:28,671 --> 00:43:31,179
Today somebody came to see me

279
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,698
he used to perspire and hot.

280
00:43:33,723 --> 00:43:37,783
And I saw him, he had  problem with his heart,

281
00:43:37,808 --> 00:43:40,418
to  look working very hard.

282
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,723
I raised his Kundalini,  he got his realization

283
00:43:57,748 --> 00:43:59,549
his perspiration stopped.

284
00:44:08,911 --> 00:44:14,037
So I told him that you should forgive,

285
00:44:14,046 --> 00:44:17,700
forgive others and that worked.

286
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:31,378
And this young fellow would have been very seriously ill

287
00:44:31,403 --> 00:44:34,948
 or dead by that kind of a  heart.

288
00:44:45,011 --> 00:44:49,807
So you get an awareness which is doubtless.

289
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:04,926
So all those who want to have their self realization

290
00:45:04,951 --> 00:45:06,125
please stay on.

291
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:09,157
If you don't want to have
should live the hall.

292
00:45:19,392 --> 00:45:25,121
One thing, you should not, you cannot pay for spirituality.

293
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:34,842
There are many false people
who are doing all  kinds of nonsense,

294
00:45:34,891 --> 00:45:38,640
only thing is you must take  to your self realization.

295
00:45:51,084 --> 00:45:54,195
So that you all become Sufis.

296
00:45:58,037 --> 00:46:00,362
You don't have to give up everything.

297
00:46:00,387 --> 00:46:03,872
Or you don’t have to become an ascetic,

298
00:46:10,652 --> 00:46:12,702
and I am a married  woman,

299
00:46:12,751 --> 00:46:17,420
I have for  children, I have for  grandchildren
 and I have got  their grandchildren .

300
00:46:24,292 --> 00:46:28,682
But I am what I am.

301
00:46:32,468 --> 00:46:35,110
That’s what should happen to you.

302
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:41,722
So again I would request

303
00:46:41,747 --> 00:46:46,003
those who don’t want have  their
self realization to  leave the hall.

304
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:53,556
Like this, like this, just like this. Yes.

305
00:46:58,978 --> 00:47:01,303
Now  close your eyes.

306
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,062
Please close.

307
00:47:10,213 --> 00:47:14,913
See If you are feeling cool breeze on your fingertips

308
00:47:36,972 --> 00:47:40,941
Now please open your eyes,

309
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:42,834
put your left hand towards me

310
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:45,707
and put the right hand

311
00:47:45,757 --> 00:47:52,167
bend your head and put the right hand
 against the fontenella bone area

312
00:47:52,183 --> 00:47:55,050
which was the soft bone in your childhood.

313
00:48:09,751 --> 00:48:13,136
See if you this coming  on the left hand,

314
00:48:16,423 --> 00:48:20,687
little it should be above the head not on  top,

315
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,239
