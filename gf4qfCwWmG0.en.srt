1
00:00:02,139 --> 00:00:04,139
[UNCLEAR]

2
00:00:14,446 --> 00:00:21,095
See born with you is the right achieve is yoga

3
00:00:23,596 --> 00:00:25,596
This is yoga is the union

4
00:00:26,145 --> 00:00:28,145
with the all-pervading

5
00:00:28,725 --> 00:00:30,645
Divine love

6
00:00:30,645 --> 00:00:32,446
so first

7
00:00:32,446 --> 00:00:34,366
you have to

8
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:36,366
Take it as a hypothesis

9
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:38,916
But keep your mind open

10
00:00:39,616 --> 00:00:41,946
If it exists there is a power

11
00:00:43,095 --> 00:00:48,935
Which has come to us this knowledge has come to us from ancient times [UNCLEAR], and it stays

12
00:00:50,626 --> 00:00:55,806
Right from Markendaya, Adi sankaracharya

13
00:00:57,976 --> 00:01:01,626
Then we had 13th-century Dnyaneshwara

14
00:01:03,136 --> 00:01:06,305
who described [UNCLEAR]

15
00:01:09,075 --> 00:01:11,075
then we had Kabira, Janaka

16
00:01:11,356 --> 00:01:17,375
Namadeva all of them all these saints sung the Sahaj Samadhi

17
00:01:25,056 --> 00:01:29,396
He needs awareness the Samadhi mean where it is united with all pervading power

18
00:01:32,736 --> 00:01:34,736
This is our heritage

19
00:01:35,646 --> 00:01:41,095
This cannot come from British. They're still primitive as far as

20
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:45,716
our spiritual life is concerned

21
00:01:48,395 --> 00:01:52,765
It's so primitive that recently there was a big quarrel

22
00:01:55,026 --> 00:01:56,975
Whether the women

23
00:01:56,975 --> 00:01:58,206
should

24
00:01:58,206 --> 00:02:04,645
Become the priest or not. I mean in India women is regarded as Sakthi

25
00:02:05,736 --> 00:02:08,186
So I mean as far as the spirituality is concerned

26
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:11,005
They do not have much ideas

27
00:02:12,276 --> 00:02:14,276
Now this is our heritage

28
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:17,575
from ancient times it has been with us

29
00:02:19,116 --> 00:02:21,116
we had three types of

30
00:02:22,146 --> 00:02:24,146
you can say

31
00:02:25,686 --> 00:02:27,805
Search by people

32
00:02:29,196 --> 00:02:36,715
Three institutions you can say or three types of people were searching the truth, perhaps our country is so good that

33
00:02:37,986 --> 00:02:39,986
We can live in a forest

34
00:02:40,236 --> 00:02:44,905
See in India if you have to go out of the house takes half an hour to dress up yourself

35
00:02:45,155 --> 00:02:49,255
we have to always fight with nature. Our country so congenial

36
00:02:50,706 --> 00:02:53,605
The people could live in the forest they don't have to worry about all these outside things

37
00:02:54,935 --> 00:02:58,765
And so this knowledge was you can say

38
00:03:00,456 --> 00:03:06,445
One of three types first one by which they went into research

39
00:03:12,595 --> 00:03:14,595
of all the creation

40
00:03:18,205 --> 00:03:23,145
why these creation is done I mean all the material side of it, so that's how we had

41
00:03:24,476 --> 00:03:28,395
Since now all the idea about all the Antariksha means all the

42
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:35,925
Heavenly bodies that we call as [UNCLEAR] all these things they knew. the astrology has come from India

43
00:03:37,046 --> 00:03:39,945
So they knew about the stars this is that everything

44
00:03:40,705 --> 00:03:42,705
apart from that

45
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,166
they wanted to

46
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:51,046
make the matter to work out

47
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:59,925
And hence he would do those of [UNCLEAR] all that

48
00:04:01,345 --> 00:04:09,165
Because they wanted to utilize the matter as science. Just like science, but this time was different

49
00:04:11,425 --> 00:04:17,564
Now people won't believe you saying we had vimanas and all that, but we have this worse

50
00:04:18,986 --> 00:04:26,685
People won't believe, we are supposed to be most primitive people according to them, but we had all these sciences

51
00:04:29,995 --> 00:04:34,935
gradually built-up by people because they wanted to excite through Mantras

52
00:04:36,446 --> 00:04:38,275
those matters

53
00:04:38,275 --> 00:04:42,645
there are words like Anu, Renu. Renu is the molecule and

54
00:04:48,775 --> 00:04:50,775
Anu means Atom

55
00:04:52,286 --> 00:04:55,576
so we had all these words within us we knew all these things

56
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,595
[UNCLEAR] in a way

57
00:05:00,956 --> 00:05:04,875
This what one side they use Vedas. by using the Vedas it written that

58
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:08,295
by reading this if you do not

59
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:10,966
get [Vidita?] Vidita is the word

60
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,496
Vidita means what?

61
00:05:13,496 --> 00:05:20,025
Vidita doesn't mean know through your brain it means you should know on your central nervous system

62
00:05:24,806 --> 00:05:31,485
As you can see me and feel me in the same way you should be able to feel this all-pervading power

63
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:34,366
that is Vidita

64
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,636
another word

65
00:05:38,636 --> 00:05:40,636
Bodha like Buddha. Bodha

66
00:05:41,606 --> 00:05:47,145
both is the same that you should know it on your central nervous system that is Bodha

67
00:05:51,426 --> 00:05:53,426
so this Vidha and Bodha

68
00:05:54,246 --> 00:05:58,136
These things you should have if you are [UNCLEAR] you should get that

69
00:05:58,746 --> 00:06:00,426
other [UNCLEAR]

70
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:05,636
So what was the thing is that scientists must be realised souls? They should be evolved souls?

71
00:06:08,796 --> 00:06:10,796
this was the thing

72
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:17,216
That came another type of worship they call it as left side worship is Bakthi

73
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:22,615
Because see people were not bother so much of Material things in India

74
00:06:24,516 --> 00:06:26,516
So they were all searching

75
00:06:27,726 --> 00:06:35,576
So they thought there is some higher power it works. We saw the saints and Saints told them that you make Bakthi

76
00:06:37,026 --> 00:06:40,166
Bakthi a lot, by which you will keep your life [UNCLEAR]

77
00:06:41,646 --> 00:06:49,226
These days Bakthi have no meaning because in the mouth to say something and do something else it's different in those days, they use to do Bakthi

78
00:06:50,436 --> 00:06:53,215
By that we used to remember what they're supposed to

79
00:06:54,336 --> 00:06:58,766
What is should be the lifestyle? What is good for you? What is bad for you?

80
00:06:59,406 --> 00:07:01,406
so this Bakthi started

81
00:07:02,136 --> 00:07:04,136
But there was another third

82
00:07:08,256 --> 00:07:12,446
this was called as [Nath?]

83
00:07:13,776 --> 00:07:17,876
first one was right side another was left side, and this is in the center

84
00:07:23,826 --> 00:07:29,635
And you'll be surprised, that in this Maharastra of yours this [UNCLEAR]

85
00:07:35,436 --> 00:07:37,436
And [UNCLEAR]

86
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:40,526
they believed

87
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:45,536
In awakening that is residual power called Kundalani

88
00:07:51,456 --> 00:07:53,516
By which they could transform themselves

89
00:08:00,575 --> 00:08:05,905
So this knowledge was mostly in Sanskrit language. 6th century Adi shankaracharya talked about it

90
00:08:15,066 --> 00:08:17,066
But all in Sanskrit

91
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:19,495
general public did not [know?]

92
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:25,675
But also, there's a tradition at one guru will have only one disciple only one

93
00:08:26,436 --> 00:08:28,436
Till the [crunch?] it

94
00:08:31,295 --> 00:08:38,064
now this Guru nanaka came much later, but before that Janaka had only one disciple.

95
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:54,056
His name was Nachiketa[UNCLEAR] then in the first century Gyneswara tremendous personality at the age of 20 what he has written

96
00:08:54,216 --> 00:08:56,216
I mean I tell you people who anything about spirituality really can get lost tremendous

97
00:09:02,796 --> 00:09:04,796
Now this Gyneswara asked permission from his Guru to his brother

98
00:09:06,995 --> 00:09:09,325
You should allow me at-least to write it

99
00:09:10,296 --> 00:09:12,775
Gyneswari at least to write it

100
00:09:13,445 --> 00:09:16,645
Tell them what it is in a way that I am not going to work it out

101
00:09:17,315 --> 00:09:19,315
But let me tell the masses

102
00:09:20,046 --> 00:09:22,705
So he wrote it Gyneswari the sixth chapter

103
00:09:24,516 --> 00:09:26,516
six are there about Kundalini

104
00:09:28,745 --> 00:09:32,365
But because you see [UNCLEAR] those who were in charge of religion?

105
00:09:33,305 --> 00:09:39,835
could not accept it because they do it mean to so they said sixth chapter is [UNCLEAR] means to be abandon

106
00:09:40,326 --> 00:09:42,326
not to be written

107
00:09:42,966 --> 00:09:47,366
The whole thing went into another darkness

108
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:56,125
Because see in a moment fundamental said they need want something really come out

109
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,096
they didn't know what to do

110
00:09:59,226 --> 00:10:01,226
All right

111
00:10:04,276 --> 00:10:09,695
Then came after 16th century was full of saints

112
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,235
not only Maharastra everywhere

113
00:10:14,055 --> 00:10:16,055
even in Punjab you know that

114
00:10:17,565 --> 00:10:19,565
Guru nanak, Kabira

115
00:10:20,055 --> 00:10:24,815
[UNCLEAR] so many all over at the time of Shivaji there was

116
00:10:26,475 --> 00:10:28,475
she all full of it and

117
00:10:29,685 --> 00:10:32,734
they were talked about Kundalani. They asked

118
00:10:37,155 --> 00:10:39,016
[UNCLEAR]

119
00:10:39,016 --> 00:10:41,825
How much time do you think Kundalini to rise?

120
00:10:42,706 --> 00:10:45,125
So he said tatkSaNam that moment but the

121
00:10:45,826 --> 00:10:48,966
there should be a person who is giver and  person who take it that moment

122
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:59,945
So in that authority he should not go to that  modern writers about Kundalini these are our authorities

123
00:11:01,485 --> 00:11:04,895
But as it is very few people got realisation

124
00:11:08,175 --> 00:11:10,175
Kabira as throughout written about nothing

125
00:11:11,385 --> 00:11:12,885
he says Surathi Kundalini called Surathi

126
00:11:12,885 --> 00:11:17,224
can you imagine human beings how they are

127
00:11:18,285 --> 00:11:20,285
Surathi is the name of

128
00:11:20,385 --> 00:11:23,194
[Tabba?]

129
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,545
In Bihar where he they called Shruti tabbaa?

130
00:11:30,225 --> 00:11:32,225
She works in

131
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:39,485
then Kabira not only Kabira [UNCLEAR] he went from Maharastra to Punjab and Guru nanak respected him

132
00:11:45,285 --> 00:11:47,285
and he has written

133
00:11:49,065 --> 00:11:51,065
Such a big book in Punjabi

134
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:54,035
[UNCLEAR]

135
00:11:54,646 --> 00:12:00,545
many of his poems are in [UNCLEAR] and also of

136
00:12:01,275 --> 00:12:04,205
[UNCLEAR]

137
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,475
[UNCLEAR]

138
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:13,415
Because Guru nanaka thought best is to collect all the verses from all these

139
00:12:14,086 --> 00:12:16,086
saints and group them together

140
00:12:16,306 --> 00:12:19,595
Not to write anything else, but what they said so keep it pure

141
00:12:20,385 --> 00:12:22,745
And that's how Namadeva

142
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:29,435
who try really learn Punjabi language, and he wrote all these things in Punjabi

143
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:37,236
That is how it came, but they all have talked about right Guru Nanak said Sahaja samadhi. so that is how it came

144
00:12:37,996 --> 00:12:39,856
Sahaj samadhi lavo

145
00:12:39,856 --> 00:12:42,515
we can say Sahaj means something spontaneous or easy

146
00:12:43,815 --> 00:12:45,815
I have told you the meaning of the word Sahaj

147
00:12:50,445 --> 00:12:53,405
But everything is even it is in the book

148
00:12:54,226 --> 00:12:56,086
I've seen that

149
00:12:56,086 --> 00:13:00,276
People think by reading book you can get that sense

150
00:13:00,976 --> 00:13:02,976
like this if you have headache

151
00:13:05,505 --> 00:13:11,405
then I write down prescription take Anacin then you go on reading take Anacin take Anacin then headache won't go it will be worse even

152
00:13:11,476 --> 00:13:17,226
It's like this so all these books you see has put limitations in [UNCLEAR]

153
00:13:18,676 --> 00:13:23,735
But I've seen people who go on reading akhand ramayan akhand geeta part they go on reading

154
00:13:26,716 --> 00:13:28,716
they go on akhand

155
00:13:30,496 --> 00:13:33,126
What they have said, they have not seen in it

156
00:13:35,236 --> 00:13:39,695
Nanaka Said [UNCLEAR] why are you going to the jungle

157
00:13:41,356 --> 00:13:44,165
He says it is in with in you why are you going to Jungles?

158
00:13:51,346 --> 00:13:53,825
So all the Saints had to suffer in a way

159
00:13:55,426 --> 00:13:57,426
because nobody understood

160
00:13:58,486 --> 00:14:01,595
See the bond has to be established nobody understood

161
00:14:09,385 --> 00:14:11,385
So this Kundalini awakening

162
00:14:12,746 --> 00:14:18,915
It's a residual power within us as you know we have three autonomous nervous system within us

163
00:14:20,366 --> 00:14:26,265
One is left side Other is right side sympathetic and in the center we have parasympathetic nervous system

164
00:14:26,816 --> 00:14:30,915
And whatever we have achieved in our evolutionary process as human being

165
00:14:32,816 --> 00:14:36,825
Is Expressed by our central nervous system?

166
00:14:37,885 --> 00:14:39,236
Alright

167
00:14:39,236 --> 00:14:44,866
Like see if you want to take this dog to a dirty he can go we have

168
00:14:45,866 --> 00:14:47,866
We have conception of beauty

169
00:14:48,326 --> 00:14:51,556
We can see beauty we can understand colors he does not

170
00:14:52,316 --> 00:14:58,155
So in evolutionary process whatever we have achieved is expressed in our central nervous system

171
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:13,165
Now it should be treated as hypothesis to begin with to see because you should not take it for granted at all

172
00:15:16,896 --> 00:15:19,435
Now this Kundalini resides in the triangular bone

173
00:15:20,676 --> 00:15:22,676
Which is called as sacrum

174
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:26,095
That means that the greek knew it's a sacred bone

175
00:15:29,676 --> 00:15:32,395
It's a greek word sacred in greek word

176
00:15:33,185 --> 00:15:34,476
is

177
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:36,476
at the base of the

178
00:15:37,086 --> 00:15:39,596
spinal chord there is a bone triangular

179
00:15:40,956 --> 00:15:42,956
is lies with that

180
00:15:43,505 --> 00:15:46,434
And about that are six centers

181
00:15:49,055 --> 00:15:51,175
below that is one center

182
00:15:57,546 --> 00:15:59,546
below that is the center

183
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,145
Which we call as Mooladhar

184
00:16:04,236 --> 00:16:07,255
Because Kundalini is the Mool means a root

185
00:16:08,406 --> 00:16:13,616
because is the support of root. Mooladhar

186
00:16:15,305 --> 00:16:18,115
Now in the medical terminology and understand

187
00:16:19,086 --> 00:16:20,406
that

188
00:16:20,406 --> 00:16:23,846
the center of looks after on the physical side

189
00:16:24,996 --> 00:16:27,746
Our pelvic plexus

190
00:16:31,326 --> 00:16:38,846
Which deals or which functions or all of our excretion including sex

191
00:16:52,086 --> 00:16:54,086
now this is

192
00:16:55,296 --> 00:16:59,936
to be understood very clearly that it is like below the Kundalini

193
00:17:01,776 --> 00:17:07,016
So sex does not play any part in rising its a very important point

194
00:17:23,445 --> 00:17:25,246
Okay, people have

195
00:17:25,246 --> 00:17:29,105
perverted the whole thing. I don't know all kinds of things that they have done

196
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:33,666
and they said that to the sex energy which has to increase

197
00:17:34,516 --> 00:17:37,926
There's nothing like sex energy It's like any other energy

198
00:17:39,796 --> 00:17:42,665
But only thing with that

199
00:17:44,986 --> 00:17:46,986
this Energy is

200
00:17:47,686 --> 00:17:50,436
used for a particular purpose of excretion or

201
00:17:51,376 --> 00:17:52,726
communication

202
00:17:52,726 --> 00:18:00,666
Of your desires or whatever it is, but it had nothing to do either ascending ascent of the Kundalini nothing to do

203
00:18:06,736 --> 00:18:08,736
on the contrary

204
00:18:08,986 --> 00:18:11,016
when the Kundalini awakened

205
00:18:11,806 --> 00:18:14,256
this center absolutely stops

206
00:18:14,776 --> 00:18:16,776
no excretion of any

207
00:18:16,816 --> 00:18:20,346
You will be surprised sometimes I have program for 10 hours

208
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,016
11 hours I won't go to bathroom

209
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:26,286
It just stops

210
00:18:29,116 --> 00:18:35,916
That's why Christ have said you have to become a children to enter it to the Kingdom because this is the innocence

211
00:18:46,706 --> 00:18:48,825
Now this going little further

212
00:18:49,976 --> 00:18:51,446
is that

213
00:18:51,446 --> 00:18:53,126
on the center

214
00:18:53,126 --> 00:18:54,626
is placed

215
00:18:54,626 --> 00:18:56,626
the deity of Shri Ganesha

216
00:19:00,116 --> 00:19:01,496
it has great meaning

217
00:19:01,496 --> 00:19:05,056
What is Shri Ganesha how this is placed there all that suff we will learn

218
00:19:06,236 --> 00:19:09,196
but I told this scientist in America

219
00:19:10,586 --> 00:19:13,575
that this center is made of carbon atom

220
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:17,745
Carbon atom has got four leaves?

221
00:19:19,256 --> 00:19:21,146
if you see

222
00:19:21,146 --> 00:19:23,066
this center

223
00:19:23,066 --> 00:19:25,185
has a carbon atom

224
00:19:26,186 --> 00:19:28,755
you make the model out of carbon atom

225
00:19:30,116 --> 00:19:34,906
Then you watch if you see this one, how many are you trained?

226
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:37,646
the

227
00:19:37,646 --> 00:19:39,236
Scientist is here

228
00:19:39,236 --> 00:19:46,516
So if you see it from right side on the left side what you see of that atom is Swastika

229
00:19:47,756 --> 00:19:49,756
clearly

230
00:19:57,986 --> 00:19:59,986
see

231
00:20:02,186 --> 00:20:04,186
just show them they are journalist

232
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:11,325
[UNCLEAR]

233
00:20:14,366 --> 00:20:18,616
So you see from left side the right side you see Swastika

234
00:20:23,966 --> 00:20:29,176
Then you should go see them see from the left side to the right side you see Omkara

235
00:20:34,226 --> 00:20:38,386
If you see from down upward then you see alpha and omega

236
00:20:44,696 --> 00:20:46,696
Alpha and Omega

237
00:20:47,336 --> 00:20:52,575
see now this I stated in one of my lectures these people immediately jumped on to it

238
00:20:52,576 --> 00:20:59,146
They took a atom of carbon took the model made it how about the scientists cleaner now?

239
00:20:59,146 --> 00:21:03,615
He's made this out of that beautifully made, but first they made huge myth?

240
00:21:04,546 --> 00:21:06,546


241
00:21:09,896 --> 00:21:12,555
and what Christ has said I am the alpha and omega

242
00:21:14,846 --> 00:21:20,715
In these symbols alpha Omega which we use in our mathematics are ancient

243
00:21:22,196 --> 00:21:24,196
so Christ is

244
00:21:24,806 --> 00:21:26,806
incarnation of

245
00:21:28,046 --> 00:21:30,046
the Ganesha.. it a scientific proof

246
00:21:40,306 --> 00:21:42,306
[UNCLEAR]

247
00:21:47,146 --> 00:21:49,146
[UNCLEAR]

248
00:21:56,596 --> 00:22:02,136
So Ganesha is an eternal child

249
00:22:05,776 --> 00:22:08,225
That's why he has got trunk of elephant

250
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,215
Innocence is our innocence

251
00:22:20,596 --> 00:22:22,596
so when the Kundalini rises

252
00:22:24,106 --> 00:22:26,886
And she's awaken, she can be awaken

253
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,656
somehow I

254
00:22:29,656 --> 00:22:31,426
Must say that

255
00:22:31,426 --> 00:22:33,426
this Modern Sahaja yoga

256
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:37,355
Only thing if I discovered anything is this that?

257
00:22:38,206 --> 00:22:40,206
amass awakening of the Kundalini amass

258
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,296
thousands can get it

259
00:22:46,636 --> 00:22:48,636
That's all I will serve nothing much

260
00:22:49,216 --> 00:22:54,606
This is very ancient science they used to do to one person two person

261
00:22:55,126 --> 00:22:57,276
now it can be done amass

262
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:59,976
in Russia

263
00:23:00,556 --> 00:23:05,196
We always have program in a big stadium 16000 minimum people

264
00:23:07,396 --> 00:23:13,595
Practically everybody is released Russians are the best. I don't know what Communism has turned

265
00:23:17,326 --> 00:23:21,065
They are not at all idioit. They're not American style

266
00:23:22,816 --> 00:23:26,736
very straight forward and very introspective

267
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:32,166
Think he'll be stupid choices that democracy side you'll see

268
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:36,215
in America even a lock has to be different tiles

269
00:23:36,976 --> 00:23:38,976
has to be different

270
00:23:39,076 --> 00:23:41,076
door of the

271
00:23:42,476 --> 00:23:44,866
car is differently handle is different

272
00:23:44,866 --> 00:23:51,315
I mean if you get into their bathroom everything has to be different the choices are so maddening

273
00:23:51,836 --> 00:23:57,586
And there are all the time busy. What should we do something more to show that wear something different

274
00:23:58,106 --> 00:24:00,856
whole energy wasted these people

275
00:24:01,466 --> 00:24:06,165
He provided for all material things because that make them a little lethargically careless

276
00:24:06,806 --> 00:24:14,745
but on the whole there were not bothered about politics they didn't have to worry who coming to Chief Minister nothing

277
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,586
so

278
00:24:16,586 --> 00:24:18,586
see their attention was

279
00:24:18,926 --> 00:24:20,395
introspective

280
00:24:20,395 --> 00:24:25,665
And the whole thing are always be because if you see Dostoyevsky? or any one of the items

281
00:24:26,576 --> 00:24:28,576
You have read Crime and punishment

282
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:32,446
You can see how introspective even the hero was

283
00:24:34,495 --> 00:24:36,415
so wonderful knwoledge

284
00:24:36,415 --> 00:24:42,644
These people that they even the hero introspect before falling in love why I'm falling in love

285
00:24:42,645 --> 00:24:49,004
What is the thing but it's wonderful so these people are very introspective and so in Russia it has become extremely

286
00:24:49,586 --> 00:24:53,265
Extremely successful, but all other your gurus and all of them

287
00:25:02,236 --> 00:25:04,236
And they have a sense also, I think

288
00:25:05,596 --> 00:25:07,596
what is truth and what is not

289
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:10,865
Moreover if anybody who asks for money

290
00:25:13,666 --> 00:25:15,056
They don't like they understand you can't sell spirituality they don't like

291
00:25:15,076 --> 00:25:19,056
how you can't sell spirituality

292
00:25:19,786 --> 00:25:23,585
Not in India even we don't understand this of course American's understand this

293
00:25:25,006 --> 00:25:27,006
The more you charge the better it is

294
00:25:29,656 --> 00:25:34,115
They would say like this is a these gurus are very good they have sale

295
00:25:36,016 --> 00:25:39,095
It's all shopping its marketting

296
00:25:40,936 --> 00:25:43,956
But they understood and we have now

297
00:25:45,466 --> 00:25:47,466
200 doctors in Russia practising Sahaja yoga

298
00:25:50,536 --> 00:25:52,536
and the scientists

299
00:25:53,416 --> 00:25:55,416
300 of them invited

300
00:25:56,056 --> 00:26:02,826
And when I talk about science, they said no more science we had enough we have reached the last end of it

301
00:26:02,826 --> 00:26:05,526
We don't want anything of you you tell us about gods law

302
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:10,445
Divine laws please don't talk about science

303
00:26:13,276 --> 00:26:17,345
They also he come like this is somebody here, but was working really well

304
00:26:24,076 --> 00:26:26,706
So what happens when the Kundalini awakens?

305
00:26:29,836 --> 00:26:31,836
it passes through

306
00:26:33,976 --> 00:26:40,356
Six centers as I told you the first is establish is innocence. That's the support

307
00:26:44,746 --> 00:26:46,746
Then it rises through six centers

308
00:26:47,986 --> 00:26:54,065
now on the physical side we suffer because our centers are out of real

309
00:26:55,966 --> 00:26:57,966
extreme living

310
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:11,435
So Kundalini what she does, these are the centers so the left and right sympathetic

311
00:27:11,836 --> 00:27:14,015
they combine and form a center like this in the spinal chord

312
00:27:15,436 --> 00:27:16,606
spinal chord

313
00:27:16,606 --> 00:27:21,785
and what happens if you start thinking too much on right side because you are very futuristic planning time

314
00:27:22,366 --> 00:27:26,375
Journalist use later like that and so we start would be more towards the right

315
00:27:27,046 --> 00:27:30,336
All right those are very emotional type they go towards left

316
00:27:32,145 --> 00:27:37,835
Sometimes something can happen they just break and things like cancer [UNCLEAR] what you got?

317
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:42,335
Psychosomatic diseases can be caused this kind of imbalance left

318
00:27:42,336 --> 00:27:48,366
not that even if you are on the right or on the left if you go too far you might get those

319
00:27:48,946 --> 00:27:51,305
Psychosomatic which are supposed to be incurable

320
00:28:08,216 --> 00:28:13,756
Now this Kundalini what she does is she goes here and passes through here

321
00:28:13,756 --> 00:28:18,046
just like we put the beats into threads

322
00:28:18,836 --> 00:28:22,846
Into what you call threads in that it goes on threading all over

323
00:28:23,756 --> 00:28:26,506
So she integrates our center

324
00:28:27,326 --> 00:28:28,676
Let's see

325
00:28:28,676 --> 00:28:30,676
Normally if you want to do something

326
00:28:33,806 --> 00:28:41,206
You decide to do something, but really your intelligence will say no. Oh, maybe you're attention may not be there

327
00:28:43,316 --> 00:28:45,316
and then you become an integrated personality

328
00:28:47,006 --> 00:28:49,006
Whatever you do

329
00:28:49,376 --> 00:28:51,376
With your heart with your brain

330
00:28:52,826 --> 00:28:55,276
Complete integration. There's no problem

331
00:28:58,586 --> 00:29:03,705
First is that but what is the outward manifestation is that

332
00:29:05,336 --> 00:29:11,986
once she crosses over first dilatation of the pupils takes place isn't it kind of a

333
00:29:14,306 --> 00:29:16,256
in

334
00:29:16,256 --> 00:29:19,245
little shine in the eyes comes

335
00:29:24,546 --> 00:29:32,395
And then it pierces through here, which is that fontanel bone area which in our language we call it Talu?

336
00:29:33,816 --> 00:29:35,816
In Sanskrit its Talu

337
00:29:41,616 --> 00:29:45,866
this thing suddenly opens out and it comes out and

338
00:29:46,566 --> 00:29:51,566
That energy becomes one with the subtle energies all pervading power

339
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:58,616
So now first we have to accept one is that first truth is

340
00:30:00,696 --> 00:30:06,415
That there is all-pervading power which does all the living work

341
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:17,096
We never questioned who does living work. How do we grow how does the seed becomes a tree we never questioned

342
00:30:17,766 --> 00:30:19,766
accept it look at our eyes what a camera

343
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:29,335
Look at our brain what a computer?We never bother question from where do we get this is done by this all-pervading divine

344
00:30:31,386 --> 00:30:33,386
second truth is

345
00:30:33,696 --> 00:30:37,946
That you are not this body mind intellect  you're not because it's my intellect

346
00:30:38,886 --> 00:30:41,036
You say my heart my body

347
00:30:42,396 --> 00:30:44,396
What is yourself?

348
00:30:45,096 --> 00:30:47,096
is the Spirit

349
00:30:47,856 --> 00:30:55,795
So you are the Spirit the rest is my this my that. My mother my sister my house my body my eyes

350
00:30:57,126 --> 00:31:03,925
So who is this my  - who is this I obviously saw through in this Spirit so this spirit

351
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:07,446
you have to become

352
00:31:07,446 --> 00:31:13,976
So far your attention is on the body your attention is on your eyes and everything

353
00:31:14,646 --> 00:31:16,646
then what happens as

354
00:31:16,686 --> 00:31:19,256
if you watch a house from outside

355
00:31:19,956 --> 00:31:21,906
the beginning and

356
00:31:21,906 --> 00:31:25,436
Then they will go inside after inside you watch

357
00:31:27,966 --> 00:31:33,445
So the whole awareness becomes very different

358
00:31:34,746 --> 00:31:42,175
this we call Turiya in Sanskrit we call it as a Fourth dimension. We live in Three dimension. This is the fourth dimension we get

359
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:50,935
the fourth Dimension, what do we get in that dimension is?

360
00:31:53,316 --> 00:31:55,316
firstly

361
00:31:55,686 --> 00:31:57,925
you stand in your present

362
00:31:59,676 --> 00:32:04,856
Now for Example you can think of the future or the past but in the present I say now be in the present you can't

363
00:32:07,775 --> 00:32:12,775
So what happens you become thoughtlessly aware you're aware, but absolutely no thought

364
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:16,016
because thoughts come to

365
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,396
you

366
00:32:18,396 --> 00:32:20,346
from the past

367
00:32:20,346 --> 00:32:22,346
or from the future

368
00:32:22,926 --> 00:32:25,766
In between these thoughts there is a little space

369
00:32:27,126 --> 00:32:29,575
so when this Kundalini rises she

370
00:32:31,176 --> 00:32:35,366
Makes that space, and that's the space is the present [UNCLEAR]

371
00:32:38,346 --> 00:32:43,585
And spiritual life you grow only in the present because that's truth

372
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:46,886
You see the past is finished the future doesn't exist

373
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:54,325
But in the present in the reality now is sitting me to be if the reality just number is it you don't know what will

374
00:32:54,326 --> 00:32:56,665
Happen in the future, or what her past finished

375
00:32:57,816 --> 00:33:01,466
So first in your dimension you become thoughtlessly aware

376
00:33:03,905 --> 00:33:06,985
but the second thing that happens to very wonderful

377
00:33:08,046 --> 00:33:10,046
That you start feeling

378
00:33:10,176 --> 00:33:13,736
This all-pervading power on your fingertips

379
00:33:16,596 --> 00:33:19,976
as very gently cool breeze on your finger tips

380
00:33:22,766 --> 00:33:24,766


381
00:33:25,746 --> 00:33:33,595
Adi sankaracharya has called Salilam Satyam even Christ has said cool breeze of the holy ghost

382
00:33:35,856 --> 00:33:37,856
Kundalini is the reflection

383
00:33:38,556 --> 00:33:40,556
of

384
00:33:42,246 --> 00:33:46,675
Adi Shakti or holy ghost in human beings

385
00:33:56,256 --> 00:33:58,706
as a result of that you're all these

386
00:33:59,286 --> 00:34:00,786
sympathetically system

387
00:34:00,786 --> 00:34:05,245
You have an ending to the sympathetic nervous system the Left-hand side seven five

388
00:34:05,826 --> 00:34:07,536
six and seven

389
00:34:07,536 --> 00:34:09,536
five six and seven

390
00:34:09,966 --> 00:34:14,845
So the left side is emotional side right side is your physical and mental side

391
00:34:19,206 --> 00:34:24,325
we will give you the books so it is easy for you know then you can start feeling

392
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:28,795
Not only is power, but he start feeling others

393
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:35,875
Americans they called it Vibes  they don't know what they mean by Vibes very good vibes actually vibes

394
00:34:37,806 --> 00:34:39,426
1972

395
00:34:39,426 --> 00:34:46,496
Mr.. Charlie said mother you get all these things listed or something as for. He said, they're writing down all your thing that

396
00:34:47,076 --> 00:34:49,076
is very good idea nothing wrong

397
00:34:53,286 --> 00:34:56,185
Awakening has to be done now first of all the main thing

398
00:34:56,436 --> 00:35:00,746
That has to be done if you just take my words and write it down. What is that?

399
00:35:00,746 --> 00:35:04,766
I don't want to become the monopoly of that. It's very good [UNCLEAR]

400
00:35:05,496 --> 00:35:07,615
The result of that okay now

401
00:35:08,226 --> 00:35:10,176
feel the centers of

402
00:35:10,176 --> 00:35:12,865
yourself so it's the self-knowledge and

403
00:35:13,416 --> 00:35:15,416
You can feel

404
00:35:15,786 --> 00:35:17,786
Center of others

405
00:35:18,156 --> 00:35:20,156
on your finger tips

406
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:28,016
Can feel what's wrong with you? What's wrong with you. You don't have to tell anything you just know that this is wrong

407
00:35:29,256 --> 00:35:30,486
now

408
00:35:30,486 --> 00:35:32,486
somehow if I know

409
00:35:33,666 --> 00:35:35,756
how to correct this centers you can be cured

410
00:35:38,196 --> 00:35:43,196
But all this is is mental physical emotion all of them are due to this

411
00:35:44,526 --> 00:35:50,575
And also spiritual problems, but if you put wrong gurus this that you get spiritual problems

412
00:35:53,646 --> 00:35:55,646
False people

413
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:07,266
So a new dimension in your awareness comes

414
00:36:08,026 --> 00:36:11,915
called as collective consciousness collective

415
00:36:12,886 --> 00:36:14,886
Samuhik chetana

416
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:19,566
So now who is other

417
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:26,015
I Can feel you I can feel them and every eight so with them you become part and parcel of the whole

418
00:36:33,646 --> 00:36:35,975
and then another great thing at the side

419
00:36:36,616 --> 00:36:39,005
all your fingertips you can feel absolute truth

420
00:36:39,646 --> 00:36:42,875
absolute truth which cannot be challenged

421
00:36:45,076 --> 00:36:47,076
Absolute

422
00:36:48,046 --> 00:36:50,046
Say you have ten children

423
00:36:50,356 --> 00:36:53,315
they are realised soul and tie up their eyes

424
00:36:54,136 --> 00:36:59,075
Ask them. What's the matter of this lady

425
00:37:00,826 --> 00:37:02,945
they raise one finder. you ask the lady have you got throat trouble?

426
00:37:04,246 --> 00:37:06,246
Is how you know?

427
00:37:06,646 --> 00:37:08,646
because this finger is not right

428
00:37:10,636 --> 00:37:13,295
Everybody will say the same. I'm in a program

429
00:37:13,966 --> 00:37:18,726
one man came why everybody's asking what is your relationship with your father? What is really?

430
00:37:18,726 --> 00:37:23,435
Why we bother with my father I said its the center you are catching on your heart

431
00:37:25,246 --> 00:37:27,246
That's what they ask

432
00:37:28,006 --> 00:37:30,185
Everybody asking they feeling it

433
00:37:31,576 --> 00:37:33,576
So everybody feels the same

434
00:37:34,006 --> 00:37:40,145
And you want to know about anybody say about Christ. Was he a son of God? Just put your hands like this. suddenly it flows!

435
00:37:43,606 --> 00:37:49,055
But somebody is a thieves. or false man you put your hands

436
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:54,696
just even if he's not in here you get burnings you get these little

437
00:37:55,966 --> 00:38:03,455
Things and he gets all you might even get sometimes you blisters so you become enlighten now imagine how fantastic

438
00:38:08,476 --> 00:38:13,925
This is outside and inside you can completely transformed

439
00:38:23,876 --> 00:38:26,835
We have people were supposed to be

440
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:40,216
Like burning fire as far as the temper was concern they become now like himalayas suddenly

441
00:38:45,686 --> 00:38:49,515
People have changed apart from the health we of course

442
00:38:50,096 --> 00:38:52,016
We have definitely seen

443
00:38:52,016 --> 00:38:59,776
So many people world of blood cancer as ordinary cancer heart cancer so many. I mean there's so many them

444
00:39:00,566 --> 00:39:03,676
Rahul? - really when asked he had a massive heart attack

445
00:39:04,286 --> 00:39:09,466
And he got cured with Sahaja yoga you won't believe he went to houston and doctor shouted him

446
00:39:09,776 --> 00:39:12,046
So it is like that so many people have been cured

447
00:39:12,596 --> 00:39:15,015
but it's far anybody's power which cures

448
00:39:16,526 --> 00:39:21,015
It's your own this within you its your own power

449
00:39:26,666 --> 00:39:28,936
as a result of that power

450
00:39:30,506 --> 00:39:37,006
Which is actually is your own mother everybody has individual Kundalini own  mother and she gives you the new birth

451
00:39:38,696 --> 00:39:42,976
She looks after you... so this Kundalini will not only cure your incurable disease so many have been cured that you won't believe that now we have doctor in every country practising Sahaja yoga.

452
00:41:01,326 --> 00:41:03,326
Third one

453
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:07,405
Third & Fourth  both came from TM

454
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:12,385
Transmitting disease, but they developed

455
00:41:16,026 --> 00:41:20,276
issues homesexual even after getting cured they went back to same habit. so they got it back

456
00:41:22,596 --> 00:41:29,755
One fellow we still have who survived for 8 years for healthy is doing very well. He is in Australia

457
00:41:31,145 --> 00:41:35,785
The trouble with that age differences is they have no will power

458
00:41:41,896 --> 00:41:47,706
see what you call center hearth means they are so insecure so insecure

459
00:41:48,946 --> 00:41:54,425
That you see after getting cure also you have keep to certain [matya?]

460
00:41:55,396 --> 00:41:57,396
you have to be

461
00:41:57,796 --> 00:42:00,306
But they don't then then indulge into homosexuality

462
00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:03,486
or

463
00:42:08,146 --> 00:42:11,166
Outside will show we are like martyr

464
00:42:11,926 --> 00:42:13,926
inside they are very weak

465
00:42:14,086 --> 00:42:16,086
So it happens like that

466
00:42:16,276 --> 00:42:20,225
If they really want live they can if they really want to work it out they can

467
00:42:23,446 --> 00:42:27,335
But with Sahaja yoga you can never get AIDS that's one thing guaranteed

468
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:31,506
Because all your priority changes

469
00:42:34,006 --> 00:42:38,646
in Sahaja Yoga the doctors are now

470
00:42:40,006 --> 00:42:42,396
really nobody goes to any doctor

471
00:42:46,215 --> 00:42:51,905
He knows all these things, but the doctors are finished as far as sahaja yogi's are concerned

472
00:42:52,876 --> 00:42:56,196
So at the most they might get some cold or something at most

473
00:42:57,646 --> 00:43:00,245
But they are so healthy

474
00:43:02,116 --> 00:43:04,116
They are so energetic that

475
00:43:07,066 --> 00:43:09,785
You can't imagine how a person could be like that

476
00:43:11,056 --> 00:43:16,956
[UNCLEAR]

477
00:43:19,336 --> 00:43:23,075
she get too much cold and rash and all those what you call allergy and and all

478
00:43:24,076 --> 00:43:30,186
Now is such a dynamic felow today he will be in Germany tomorrow in Japan he is so

479
00:43:31,636 --> 00:43:34,446
So healthy and so happy and so relaxed

480
00:43:36,826 --> 00:43:38,826
become absolutely a relaxed person

481
00:43:42,376 --> 00:43:48,755
It's balanced balanced very much and above all compassion very compassionate. Now all these Sahaja yogis

482
00:44:04,306 --> 00:44:06,306
they are swimming in ocean of Joy but what their headache is that mother why not have more people remain in ocean of Joy. I'm all the time travelling I went to south America I'm 70 years I'm travelling all over

483
00:44:20,806 --> 00:44:22,806
all the time but what I'm going to do If people want to come I have to do this but if but people want to come I will have to but people they don't want to come what can I do? so this is trouble they so anxious more to come and they are running up and down all over the world they are running here to there. they are trying to find more people. Even in Maharastra we goto villages bringing people. so it a country wide propagation.

484
00:45:21,466 --> 00:45:26,106
But you see actually got detached about it that you don't worry about your health

485
00:45:26,566 --> 00:45:30,275
you don't worry about your age  you don't even think of it

486
00:45:31,996 --> 00:45:36,006
you feel very Young and all the time the active over this just don't feel for it

487
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:46,056
There is no group like young, old. We all enjoyed together. Whatever maybe there is a small boy

488
00:45:47,185 --> 00:45:54,854
adult that doesn't exist. also that doesn't exist in religion as far as the outside religion nothing, for example we worship Rama

489
00:45:55,766 --> 00:45:57,266
We worship Shri Krishna

490
00:45:57,266 --> 00:46:01,905
Also, be worship Mohammad Saheb because he was Dattatreya. They don't know but we know

491
00:46:03,266 --> 00:46:05,266
He was Dattatreya

492
00:46:07,046 --> 00:46:13,095
And Fathima we worship because she came as Sita latter on, so we worship we know that

493
00:46:15,536 --> 00:46:17,536
It's not just

494
00:46:17,665 --> 00:46:19,435
Sarva Dharma Sambhav

495
00:46:19,435 --> 00:46:25,485
Even Gandhiji was not like this the way these people work. Gandhiji in his prayers

496
00:46:25,486 --> 00:46:29,895
I was with him from my child actually I helped him in writing his

497
00:46:31,195 --> 00:46:36,765
Sequels of [UNCLEAR] all about Kundalini we wrote. He was a realised soul

498
00:46:38,306 --> 00:46:44,326
But we were fighting for freedom that time and he said without freedom what is the use of Spirituality

499
00:46:50,786 --> 00:46:52,786
so Gandhiji

500
00:46:57,836 --> 00:47:03,915
if he was living today he would have definitely helped me a lot. Even Lal bahadur shastri was a realised soul

501
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,865
we are very unfortunate. we lost them

502
00:47:17,395 --> 00:47:19,395
Gurbachan?

503
00:47:21,025 --> 00:47:26,264
Gurbachan is realised soul? yes, he was a realised soul.

504
00:47:34,645 --> 00:47:36,645
But his wife you know you see?!. He is very high level person. Very good person. He has done his job.No doubt.

505
00:47:43,525 --> 00:47:45,525
so now this, I was tell you about

506
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:54,125
Mohammed?

507
00:47:56,176 --> 00:47:57,316
Gandhiji?

508
00:47:57,316 --> 00:47:59,945
he was a realized soul, no doubt! and he

509
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:05,735
He was the one who believed in Sarva Dharma Sambhav

510
00:48:06,916 --> 00:48:09,245
In his Sarva Dharma Sambhav

511
00:48:10,366 --> 00:48:12,666
He made everyone worship

512
00:48:14,716 --> 00:48:15,976
everyone

513
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,316
like Muslim

514
00:48:17,316 --> 00:48:20,406
Maybe a congress man or anybody used to come to Ashram

515
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:23,735
He had to say the Mantras of Shri Ganesha

516
00:48:24,826 --> 00:48:27,096
He have to take a Mantras of Vishnu

517
00:48:28,336 --> 00:48:29,746
Saraswathi

518
00:48:29,746 --> 00:48:34,175
You see it starts with the first of all

519
00:48:34,486 --> 00:48:38,046
whatever in my my heart [UNCLEAR] resides the Spirit

520
00:48:38,446 --> 00:48:43,685
See with the Spirit then he starts with Ganesh and every deity then he goes to the

521
00:48:45,496 --> 00:48:50,705
Quran and you have to say the quranic and then you have to say also this

522
00:48:51,646 --> 00:48:53,646
from the another

523
00:48:54,376 --> 00:48:56,376
Farsi

524
00:48:57,856 --> 00:48:59,146
Yes

525
00:48:59,146 --> 00:49:01,146
all that matters

526
00:49:01,726 --> 00:49:03,726
So you have to worship to all of them

527
00:49:04,036 --> 00:49:09,906
He followed [UNCLEAR] said see if you just say Sambav means you don't worship why don't you worship?

528
00:49:11,566 --> 00:49:14,856
Everybody should worship to follow them because they are different

529
00:49:15,736 --> 00:49:18,276
They are not politicians or anything

530
00:49:19,126 --> 00:49:23,975
They are not religious Christ has said those who are not against us, are with us.

531
00:49:25,306 --> 00:49:28,475
Even Mohammed saheb said also there have been 1 lac of Nabis

532
00:49:29,986 --> 00:49:33,066
He respected Christ mother more than all Deity

533
00:49:35,566 --> 00:49:37,566
Christ father

534
00:49:37,846 --> 00:49:39,846
He says she's a holy woman

535
00:49:40,906 --> 00:49:43,805
but Paul is the one who ruined Christianity

536
00:49:46,426 --> 00:49:48,426
so much, we said

537
00:49:52,036 --> 00:49:55,056
Human beings are very good ruining everything sublime or somehow or other they manage it.

538
00:49:59,816 --> 00:50:01,816
if you see through a essence of christ

539
00:50:02,526 --> 00:50:07,165
As I told you now, alpha and omega, Christ resides in our Agnya chakra

540
00:50:08,196 --> 00:50:10,196
on the six center. Christ very important

541
00:50:22,576 --> 00:50:26,015
yeah, on the optic chiasm.

542
00:50:28,036 --> 00:50:34,116
There is on one side is the pituitary and the another side is

543
00:50:34,846 --> 00:50:36,106
the

544
00:50:36,106 --> 00:50:38,106
pineal body

545
00:50:39,406 --> 00:50:41,406
pituitary looks after our Ego

546
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:45,306
of the whole of up down working

547
00:50:46,186 --> 00:50:49,805
And the pineal body towards our conditionings

548
00:50:58,126 --> 00:51:00,126
In Chinese its Yin, Yang

549
00:51:02,086 --> 00:51:09,216
So one is Ego and another is Super ego

550
00:51:09,976 --> 00:51:11,266
psychological terminology

551
00:51:11,266 --> 00:51:18,995
So one is the ego and another is the conditioning so these two balloons go up like this gradually

552
00:51:20,806 --> 00:51:22,806
so when they cover us we are cut off

553
00:51:23,896 --> 00:51:29,285
as children Beyond one, but we don't feel but we are one, but when the Kundalini connect us

554
00:51:30,946 --> 00:51:37,385
then only you can feel it. Now you see for example this instrument or whatever you have to put it to the mains otherwise it doesn't work

555
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:41,796
So you can call this as Kundalini

556
00:51:43,336 --> 00:51:45,336
Which is in a coil?

557
00:51:45,766 --> 00:51:49,956
And some other threads come up open Sahastrara and conects

558
00:51:59,136 --> 00:52:01,136
It's subtle very subtle

559
00:52:03,006 --> 00:52:05,006
How do we live?

560
00:52:05,556 --> 00:52:07,556
we live in three Dimensions

561
00:52:08,286 --> 00:52:10,286
like I

562
00:52:11,496 --> 00:52:14,756
Am here, and I'm looking at the mirror

563
00:52:16,386 --> 00:52:24,265
So I'm the one who is observing my reflection is what I'm observing

564
00:52:25,836 --> 00:52:30,896
There is a action of observance, so there is the observer

565
00:52:31,926 --> 00:52:36,926
observed and also the observance, which is the Kriya

566
00:52:38,616 --> 00:52:41,275
activity that we live in this three

567
00:52:42,666 --> 00:52:45,535
But supposing you become the mirror

568
00:52:47,736 --> 00:52:49,736
suppose

569
00:52:49,776 --> 00:52:51,776
Then all these things drop out

570
00:52:54,186 --> 00:53:00,446
This is what is called witness state where you just watch,

571
00:53:01,746 --> 00:53:03,746
the whole thing is Drama

572
00:53:04,446 --> 00:53:09,715
But when we are not realised we get lost in the drama

573
00:53:20,946 --> 00:53:22,946
[HINDI]

574
00:53:22,946 --> 00:53:24,946
[HINDI]

575
00:53:25,626 --> 00:53:29,246
[HINDI]

576
00:53:31,296 --> 00:53:32,766
[HINDI]

577
00:53:32,766 --> 00:53:34,596
so we become

578
00:53:34,596 --> 00:53:36,716
Ourselves means we know ourselves

579
00:53:37,356 --> 00:53:39,506
we don't have to take the mirror, we know ourself

580
00:53:42,606 --> 00:53:44,606
to know yourself is the only point

581
00:53:51,726 --> 00:53:53,755
And this is our heritage

582
00:53:55,476 --> 00:54:03,145
this is the import point we Indian must understand. when they come you know they come and touch our mother land and say Namaskar

583
00:54:06,366 --> 00:54:10,345
Some of them kiss these foreigners

584
00:54:12,936 --> 00:54:16,855
the respect! Because they know what it is. I send them to Devagudu Thukaram place

585
00:54:18,156 --> 00:54:19,326
and

586
00:54:19,326 --> 00:54:22,706
other Sahaja yogis told me that mother they are rolling on the ground

587
00:54:22,706 --> 00:54:28,525
so I said what were you doing, they said mother all over mother earth this vibrations coming out. so we are rolling on-it.

588
00:54:29,586 --> 00:54:31,586


589
00:54:36,276 --> 00:54:41,096
[HINDI]

590
00:54:43,596 --> 00:54:45,596
[HINDI]

591
00:54:46,086 --> 00:54:48,356
[HINDI]

592
00:54:50,436 --> 00:54:52,436
[HINDI]

593
00:54:53,436 --> 00:54:56,755
overnight people have given up drug, drug addicts

594
00:54:57,396 --> 00:54:59,106
Alcoholics

595
00:54:59,106 --> 00:55:00,396
overnight

596
00:55:00,396 --> 00:55:02,396
[HINDI]

597
00:55:02,526 --> 00:55:07,226
[HINDI]

598
00:55:10,146 --> 00:55:12,146
but if overnight a

599
00:55:12,666 --> 00:55:19,555
[HINDI]

600
00:55:25,856 --> 00:55:28,975
They have really become righteous they really become religious

601
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:33,536
[HINDI]

602
00:55:33,846 --> 00:55:35,965
[HINDI]

603
00:55:37,266 --> 00:55:39,266
[HINDI]

604
00:55:40,296 --> 00:55:42,715
Because once you get the light, you know what it is that?

605
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:48,745
if you have snake in the hand if you are in the darkness you can't see, you can say its just a rope

606
00:55:48,746 --> 00:55:52,766
once you get the light, you just leave it, because you know its a snake

607
00:55:53,826 --> 00:55:55,826
that's what happens to them

608
00:56:01,416 --> 00:56:03,416
[HINDI]

609
00:56:03,906 --> 00:56:07,495
they become strong

610
00:56:09,246 --> 00:56:11,246
[HINDI]

611
00:56:12,876 --> 00:56:19,166
they give up aggressiveness. they are not aggressive. In their silence they become powerful

612
00:56:20,976 --> 00:56:23,336
My husband always used to say that [HINDI]

613
00:56:24,456 --> 00:56:26,456
But you cannot make anybody?

614
00:56:27,216 --> 00:56:29,996
Now he says so many angels now he has to accept

615
00:56:35,166 --> 00:56:37,616
I had to work out our years together

616
00:56:38,496 --> 00:56:44,965
What is the problem why we cannot have a amass realisation the time has come then I worked it out

617
00:56:51,716 --> 00:56:55,665
In our country especially the young generation has no destination

618
00:56:56,906 --> 00:56:58,906
They don't know what to do with themselves

619
00:56:59,546 --> 00:57:01,546
[HINDI]

620
00:57:03,806 --> 00:57:07,065
if they take to Sahaja Yoga now see in our Sahaja yoga

621
00:57:07,706 --> 00:57:08,876
Yuva sakthi

622
00:57:08,876 --> 00:57:10,876
nobody than it worked

623
00:57:11,066 --> 00:57:13,066
all boys get first class first

624
00:57:14,036 --> 00:57:15,986
All

625
00:57:15,986 --> 00:57:17,986
wherever they are educated

626
00:57:19,646 --> 00:57:21,946
all girls get married now we also have marriage system
