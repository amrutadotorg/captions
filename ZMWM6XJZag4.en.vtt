00:44:09.928 --> 00:44:14.178
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:44:21.428 --> 00:44:24.553
Some of you have found the truth,

00:44:25.573 --> 00:44:31.178
some of you have not found it fully,

00:44:31.927 --> 00:44:35.927
and some of you have not found it at all.

00:44:37.848 --> 00:44:45.928
But if you look around in today's situation,

00:44:47.795 --> 00:44:51.671
you'll have to agree there's a big turmoil going on.

00:44:54.074 --> 00:44:56.921
Countries after countries are taking

00:44:57.671 --> 00:45:00.795
to all kinds of wrong things.

00:45:01.296 --> 00:45:04.171
Lot of cold war is on,

00:45:05.546 --> 00:45:07.921
people are killing each other,

00:45:09.046 --> 00:45:14.546
destroying beautiful places,

00:45:17.921 --> 00:45:22.296
cutting each other's throat for nothing at all.

00:45:23.795 --> 00:45:29.171
They are all human beings created by God.

00:45:29.795 --> 00:45:32.795
God Almighty has created them

00:45:33.296 --> 00:45:37.296
and has brought them to this level of human awareness.

00:45:39.421 --> 00:45:41.296
At this juncture

00:45:42.421 --> 00:45:46.921
one can't see where are we going in a collective way.

00:45:51.795 --> 00:45:56.796
This is, where have we to reach --or

00:45:58.046 --> 00:46:00.795
is it our destiny?

00:46:02.795 --> 00:46:06.795
Is this the destiny of human beings,

00:46:08.796 --> 00:46:11.171
to be destroyed by each other

00:46:13.046 --> 00:46:16.421
for land or for anything else?

00:46:17.671 --> 00:46:21.171
Think of the whole world as one,

00:46:22.421 --> 00:46:26.296
and think what's happening all over:

00:46:26.671 --> 00:46:29.421
every day we read newspaper,

00:46:29.795 --> 00:46:34.046
every day there is some sort of a horrible news

00:46:34.296 --> 00:46:38.546
about horrible things people are doing to each other,

00:46:38.921 --> 00:46:41.046
for no rhyme and reason.

00:46:45.796 --> 00:46:50.046
We have to think, what is the destiny?

00:46:51.421 --> 00:46:53.795
Where are we going?

00:46:55.046 --> 00:47:01.171
Are we going to hell or to Heaven?

00:47:03.296 --> 00:47:07.796
What is our situation around? Can we help it?

00:47:11.421 --> 00:47:13.921
What's wrong with human beings is

00:47:15.296 --> 00:47:23.795
they are still in the complete control of ignorance

00:47:24.171 --> 00:47:26.795
I would call it ignorance.

00:47:28.046 --> 00:47:30.796
And in that ignorance, in that darkness,

00:47:32.421 --> 00:47:35.671
they are doing these horrible things.

00:47:36.796 --> 00:47:42.671
Nobody wants to understand that what we are doing

00:47:44.046 --> 00:47:47.546
is nothing but complete destruction.

00:47:48.921 --> 00:47:51.421
Is that our destiny,

00:47:51.796 --> 00:47:55.296
that we are going to get destroyed completely?

00:47:56.296 --> 00:47:59.171
What good are we doing?

00:48:01.171 --> 00:48:05.421
Under the name of some sort of nationality

00:48:05.795 --> 00:48:08.671
or maybe some religion

00:48:08.921 --> 00:48:13.171
-- all kinds of things which are good --

00:48:13.795 --> 00:48:16.795
but we are doing all wrong things.

00:48:17.046 --> 00:48:18.921
Fighting.

00:48:19.421 --> 00:48:22.671
Fighting is not the only thing.

00:48:23.795 --> 00:48:25.421
We hate.

00:48:27.671 --> 00:48:32.046
Anybody who can excite our hatred

00:48:34.546 --> 00:48:39.546
is very much adorable, very much liked,

00:48:39.921 --> 00:48:43.421
and under his guidance we form groups.

00:48:45.296 --> 00:48:51.671
All this is coming because this is the Last Judgment.

00:48:52.046 --> 00:48:56.046
I have told you this is the Last Judgment.

00:48:57.546 --> 00:49:01.795
And this Last Judgment will really decide

00:49:02.921 --> 00:49:06.921
who are to be saved and who are to be doomed completely.

00:49:08.296 --> 00:49:11.795
It's a very, very serious thing.

00:49:12.921 --> 00:49:20.795
All of those who are aware should think about it.

00:49:21.795 --> 00:49:23.421
Little patchwork here

00:49:23.795 --> 00:49:26.795
and a little patchwork is not going to help.

00:49:27.795 --> 00:49:29.795
Whatever you may try,

00:49:30.171 --> 00:49:34.795
unless and until you transform human beings,

00:49:35.046 --> 00:49:37.171
they cannot be saved.

00:49:39.046 --> 00:49:46.671
This transformation is not an impossible thing

00:49:47.171 --> 00:49:49.296
-- it's not difficult.

00:49:49.795 --> 00:49:52.795
This is the time for transformation,

00:49:53.171 --> 00:49:55.795
this is a chance for transformation.

00:49:56.171 --> 00:50:02.046
And within us is placed the power,

00:50:03.171 --> 00:50:06.421
as Tao has described,

00:50:06.795 --> 00:50:10.046
is the mystical feminine Power within us.

00:50:10.546 --> 00:50:12.921
All of them have described it,

00:50:14.296 --> 00:50:17.421
I'm not the first person to say that;

00:50:19.046 --> 00:50:23.795
but nobody has been able perhaps so far

00:50:25.421 --> 00:50:29.795
to understand it or to accept it,

00:50:30.171 --> 00:50:32.795
that it should happen to you.

00:50:36.296 --> 00:50:41.795
You are born not only to be human beings,

00:50:42.795 --> 00:50:45.671
but you have to be superhuman.

00:50:46.795 --> 00:50:48.796
You have to enjoy yourself.

00:50:49.296 --> 00:50:52.921
Your life should be enjoyable, it should be blissful.

00:50:53.421 --> 00:50:55.421
It should not be a curse:

00:50:55.795 --> 00:50:59.421
morning till evening worried about this, worried about that.

00:51:01.795 --> 00:51:04.421
That is why you are created.

00:51:04.795 --> 00:51:08.795
God had no intention of creating people

00:51:09.296 --> 00:51:13.296
who will be all the time worried how to quarrel,

00:51:13.671 --> 00:51:15.671
how to fight, how to save;

00:51:16.921 --> 00:51:21.796
but people who will live in complete harmony,

00:51:22.546 --> 00:51:25.046
peace and joy.

00:51:27.171 --> 00:51:29.171
That's why we are created.

00:51:29.671 --> 00:51:32.795
That is our destiny -- that is,

00:51:33.171 --> 00:51:36.046
not just I am telling you, but it's a fact.

00:51:36.671 --> 00:51:44.796
So we have to be, we have to be transformed.

00:51:46.421 --> 00:51:48.921
This transformation is not difficult.

00:51:49.546 --> 00:51:56.671
But what I find, people get satisfied with anything

00:51:57.921 --> 00:52:00.795
Hindus will go to the temple;

00:52:00.921 --> 00:52:03.546
they'll think, "Oh, we have done a great thing."

00:52:04.046 --> 00:52:06.296
Christians go to the church;

00:52:06.795 --> 00:52:08.796
they'll think they have done very good.

00:52:09.546 --> 00:52:13.171
Muslims will go and pray and think that they are great.

00:52:13.795 --> 00:52:15.795
What have they achieved?

00:52:16.296 --> 00:52:18.671
Face yourself, please.

00:52:18.921 --> 00:52:22.795
Face your limitations.

00:52:23.171 --> 00:52:25.296
Face your tribulations.

00:52:25.671 --> 00:52:28.796
Face your problems and see for yourself:

00:52:29.296 --> 00:52:32.171
have you been able to solve your problems?

00:52:35.546 --> 00:52:41.795
Have you been able to save yourself from calamities?

00:52:43.296 --> 00:52:48.796
Maybe big calamities may come to destroy people who are,

00:52:49.546 --> 00:52:52.795
who are doing harm, maybe.

00:52:54.171 --> 00:52:56.671
That may be the wish of God.

00:52:57.046 --> 00:52:59.796
But what is your wish?

00:53:00.671 --> 00:53:02.795
Why don't you think that

00:53:03.171 --> 00:53:09.546
"I have to be a person who is a store,

00:53:09.921 --> 00:53:14.921
who is a source of joy and love"?

00:53:16.421 --> 00:53:21.046
I am not only talking, but I want you all

00:53:21.546 --> 00:53:23.671
to get your Self-realization.

00:53:24.296 --> 00:53:25.795
What is Self-realization

00:53:26.296 --> 00:53:29.795
-- is to know your Self. You don't know your Self.

00:53:30.796 --> 00:53:32.671
You don't know.

00:53:33.296 --> 00:53:35.796
You are living in this world without knowing your Self

00:53:36.296 --> 00:53:37.796
-- can you imagine?

00:53:38.296 --> 00:53:40.046
You don't know what you are.

00:53:40.671 --> 00:53:43.671
You don't know that you are the spirit,

00:53:44.921 --> 00:53:50.421
and that you are the source of knowledge,

00:53:50.795 --> 00:53:52.671
of pure knowledge.

00:53:53.046 --> 00:53:55.671
I find people sitting in a meeting,

00:53:56.171 --> 00:53:59.546
listening to some babaji

00:54:00.046 --> 00:54:04.046
who is telling them some story, very happy.

00:54:04.795 --> 00:54:10.671
This is not going to give you the reality and the truth.

00:54:11.795 --> 00:54:14.296
If you want to have reality and truth,

00:54:14.795 --> 00:54:16.921
then please try to understand

00:54:17.421 --> 00:54:19.796
that something has to happen

00:54:20.421 --> 00:54:23.796
to you, some transformation has to take place.

00:54:24.546 --> 00:54:26.795
You are not yet subtle enough,

00:54:27.296 --> 00:54:29.171
you haven't got those subtleties,

00:54:29.671 --> 00:54:31.795
till you reach that point --

00:54:32.171 --> 00:54:35.796
for which you don't have to leave your family,

00:54:36.546 --> 00:54:39.046
you don't have to leave your children,

00:54:40.171 --> 00:54:47.046
you don't have to leave your household and go to the jungles.

00:54:48.421 --> 00:54:50.795
There's no need to do all that.

00:54:51.421 --> 00:54:54.921
It's nice to say that "All right, you all take sanyasa

00:54:55.546 --> 00:54:58.421
and give all that belongs to you to me."

00:55:00.546 --> 00:55:03.171
It's such a stupid idea.

00:55:03.795 --> 00:55:07.795
These are emergencies today.

00:55:08.921 --> 00:55:13.671
We are living in a very emergent conditions

00:55:14.046 --> 00:55:15.546
-- try to understand.

00:55:15.921 --> 00:55:18.046
And I want to warn you

00:55:18.546 --> 00:55:20.921
that if you don't go deep into yourself

00:55:21.421 --> 00:55:24.171
and find out what you are,

00:55:25.796 --> 00:55:29.296
and take to your transformation,

00:55:29.795 --> 00:55:31.796
anything is possible.

00:55:33.296 --> 00:55:36.171
All kinds of diseases are coming up,

00:55:36.795 --> 00:55:41.046
all kinds of new problems of children coming up,

00:55:41.795 --> 00:55:45.296
all kinds of national problems are there,

00:55:45.796 --> 00:55:48.795
all kinds of international problems are there,

00:55:49.296 --> 00:55:52.171
that people can't help it.

00:55:53.421 --> 00:56:00.671
So we have to get out of this and become a solid,

00:56:00.921 --> 00:56:04.046
a personality of truth.

00:56:04.671 --> 00:56:06.671
We don't know what is the truth is.

00:56:08.296 --> 00:56:13.795
We are worse than animals whose eyes are open,

00:56:15.795 --> 00:56:17.921
while our eyes are closed.

00:56:19.296 --> 00:56:22.796
Is not to condemn yourself in any way,

00:56:23.921 --> 00:56:26.546
but to make you alert and aware

00:56:27.046 --> 00:56:30.296
that human beings have to change.

00:56:30.796 --> 00:56:34.796
Otherwise it's just, you come to My lecture,

00:56:35.296 --> 00:56:38.921
tomorrow you come to another lecture -- that's all.

00:56:39.421 --> 00:56:42.796
It's a everyday sort of a nice entertainment.

00:56:44.671 --> 00:56:49.546
But when I see the destiny,

00:56:50.046 --> 00:56:52.921
I don't know how many will be ruined,

00:56:53.671 --> 00:56:56.046
how many will be finished.

00:56:56.671 --> 00:56:58.546
What will happen to them?

00:56:58.921 --> 00:57:01.171
What diseases they will get,

00:57:01.795 --> 00:57:04.296
what problems they will get?

00:57:04.795 --> 00:57:06.921
What will happen to their children,

00:57:07.921 --> 00:57:10.296
what will happen to their country,

00:57:10.795 --> 00:57:13.421
and what will happen to the whole world?

00:57:14.795 --> 00:57:17.671
Just widen your vision.

00:57:18.795 --> 00:57:23.546
My vision is that all the people of the world

00:57:24.046 --> 00:57:26.421
should get transformation.

00:57:27.795 --> 00:57:31.671
We have enemies within ourselves,

00:57:34.296 --> 00:57:36.171
and when they talk of jihad,

00:57:36.671 --> 00:57:40.296
they talk that you fight your enemies within yourself.

00:57:40.796 --> 00:57:42.796
What are these enemies?

00:57:44.171 --> 00:57:47.796
These days, the worst is greed.

00:57:49.171 --> 00:57:51.546
There is greed.

00:57:51.921 --> 00:57:57.296
With that greed people can do anything they want to

00:57:57.796 --> 00:58:01.796
All kinds of things are happening out of greed.

00:58:02.421 --> 00:58:07.421
They'll have money, they'll have all kinds of facilities,

00:58:07.796 --> 00:58:12.671
but still this greed is such a satanic will of,

00:58:12.921 --> 00:58:15.921
that you don't even see what you have.

00:58:16.546 --> 00:58:20.796
And you want to have more and more, deceive people,

00:58:21.421 --> 00:58:24.296
deceive your government,

00:58:24.795 --> 00:58:28.171
deceive everyone and manage it.

00:58:33.795 --> 00:58:40.421
Then, another worse thing we have is anger.

00:58:41.795 --> 00:58:45.671
Anger doesn't allow you to see things as they are.

00:58:48.421 --> 00:58:52.421
We develop anger for small things:

00:58:53.795 --> 00:58:57.796
like you have come to this country --

00:58:59.296 --> 00:59:06.795
I've seen people who are angry because of different color.

00:59:09.795 --> 00:59:11.796
I can't understand.

00:59:12.546 --> 00:59:14.921
God has made different colors;

00:59:15.296 --> 00:59:19.546
other we all would have looked same, like military,

00:59:20.421 --> 00:59:22.796
and life would have been miserable.

00:59:23.171 --> 00:59:26.046
So the color has been created by nature.

00:59:26.671 --> 00:59:31.921
So the whites or blacks -- what is the difference?

00:59:33.421 --> 00:59:35.795
I just don't understand.

00:59:36.296 --> 00:59:42.046
Because such a myth is going on.

00:59:43.296 --> 00:59:46.171
With this myth we are fighting.

00:59:46.795 --> 00:59:49.921
The whites are fighting with the blacks,

00:59:50.296 --> 00:59:52.921
and the blacks are fighting with the whites.

00:59:54.421 --> 01:00:02.296
And then they go also for burning their skin in the sun,

01:00:04.421 --> 01:00:06.795
getting skin cancers.

01:00:07.421 --> 01:00:09.421
I just don't understand.

01:00:09.796 --> 01:00:12.796
There's no logic, there's no balance

01:00:13.296 --> 01:00:16.795
in us to see that what we are doing.

01:00:18.171 --> 01:00:22.796
Why are we wasting this precious time,

01:00:23.546 --> 01:00:26.046
when we have to get transformation?

01:00:27.171 --> 01:00:30.296
This anger can be with anything;

01:00:32.795 --> 01:00:35.795
anything one can develop anger.

01:00:36.296 --> 01:00:41.546
Is like a human failing, which is very common.

01:00:42.795 --> 01:00:46.171
For the smallest thing people can get angry.

01:00:46.795 --> 01:00:50.296
And they like it, because with that they can oppress others;

01:00:50.795 --> 01:00:52.795
they could be aggressive.

01:00:53.171 --> 01:00:57.046
So they want to have this anger within them,

01:00:57.795 --> 01:01:01.921
and with that anger they try to dominate others.

01:01:03.921 --> 01:01:06.046
This is the biggest problem:

01:01:06.671 --> 01:01:10.795
why do we want to dominate others,

01:01:11.296 --> 01:01:13.795
why do we want to oppress others,

01:01:14.421 --> 01:01:17.546
and why do we want to take control of others?

01:01:17.921 --> 01:01:19.921
We can't control ourselves;

01:01:20.296 --> 01:01:23.546
why are we wanting to control others?

01:01:24.546 --> 01:01:25.921
What is the need?

01:01:29.046 --> 01:01:32.296
Then, there are attachments:

01:01:33.421 --> 01:01:38.171
attachments to their houses,

01:01:38.546 --> 01:01:43.546
to their lands, to their children, to everything.

01:01:44.046 --> 01:01:50.296
But tomorrow you won't be here.

01:01:52.546 --> 01:01:54.796
You'll go with open hands.

01:01:55.421 --> 01:01:58.671
You can't carry anything with you.

01:01:59.921 --> 01:02:05.171
So such attachment to things:

01:02:06.421 --> 01:02:09.421
they're very particular about their cars,

01:02:09.795 --> 01:02:12.546
about their house, maintain it.

01:02:12.795 --> 01:02:17.795
But what about yourself? Are you all right?

01:02:18.921 --> 01:02:24.921
Inside, are you absolutely calm, peaceful and joyful?

01:02:26.421 --> 01:02:28.796
Why are you wasting your energy

01:02:36.795 --> 01:02:40.046
in getting angry with others?

01:02:45.421 --> 01:02:55.171
That's the sign of life that will be also destroyed.

01:02:58.795 --> 01:03:07.796
If you look at another person he has, say, weaknesses,

01:03:09.546 --> 01:03:13.296
apart from money, for women -- is very common --

01:03:13.796 --> 01:03:16.795
or women having for men.

01:03:17.921 --> 01:03:21.546
To get attractive, for what?

01:03:22.796 --> 01:03:25.171
Everybody has to get old.

01:03:26.421 --> 01:03:32.171
What have you achieved by running after women,

01:03:32.671 --> 01:03:36.795
running after other sex?

01:03:37.921 --> 01:03:42.795
You have no sense of dignity, no sense of honor.

01:03:43.296 --> 01:03:46.171
If you are -- as long as you wear very good clothes

01:03:46.546 --> 01:03:48.795
you are regarded wonderful person.

01:03:50.171 --> 01:03:51.795
This is not the way.

01:03:52.296 --> 01:03:55.795
We have to introspect and see for ourselves:

01:03:56.296 --> 01:03:58.296
why are we doing this,

01:03:58.795 --> 01:04:01.795
wasting our energy into nonsensical thing?

01:04:06.421 --> 01:04:11.671
So many people I meet are really half-mad and far gone;

01:04:11.921 --> 01:04:14.296
some of them are full-mad.

01:04:15.796 --> 01:04:17.796
And what they tell Me, that

01:04:18.296 --> 01:04:20.671
they wanted to marry a particular woman

01:04:20.796 --> 01:04:22.796
and a particular man or anything,

01:04:23.296 --> 01:04:26.921
and that's how they got it. I mean, how fragile!

01:04:29.796 --> 01:04:31.796
That's not being very great.

01:04:32.546 --> 01:04:38.296
You have to be very, very strong within yourself.

01:04:38.795 --> 01:04:43.421
Feel your Self. Your Self is the spirit,

01:04:43.795 --> 01:04:47.171
is the reflection of God Almighty within you.

01:04:47.795 --> 01:04:50.296
You can be very strong,

01:04:50.795 --> 01:04:52.546
you can be very healthy

01:04:52.795 --> 01:04:54.796
and you can be absolutely balanced,

01:04:55.296 --> 01:04:57.046
if you become the spirit.

01:04:58.546 --> 01:05:02.546
You have heard so much about spirit and spiritual life

01:05:05.795 --> 01:05:08.795
-- but have you reached that point?

01:05:10.046 --> 01:05:13.546
Even when you read, say, Zen system,

01:05:13.796 --> 01:05:18.546
Tao system, Bible, Koran, anything,

01:05:20.546 --> 01:05:24.796
do you know how to reach that point of the spirit?

01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:27.796
Not yet. Not yet.

01:05:28.546 --> 01:05:30.795
You have to know that;

01:05:31.171 --> 01:05:33.671
because you are very great,

01:05:34.046 --> 01:05:36.796
you are very precious,

01:05:37.421 --> 01:05:40.795
and you are so beautiful within.

01:05:41.796 --> 01:05:44.171
But you are not aware of it.

01:05:45.296 --> 01:05:47.421
You have to become that.

01:05:48.546 --> 01:05:51.796
That becoming is very important,

01:05:52.421 --> 01:05:57.796
and for that already God Almighty has organized within you

01:05:59.171 --> 01:06:02.921
which is called as kundalini,

01:06:04.796 --> 01:06:06.796
which can be awakened,

01:06:07.546 --> 01:06:12.171
and its awakening can give you Self-realization,

01:06:12.796 --> 01:06:17.296
can give you self-knowledge which we call "Atma sakshatkar."

01:06:17.795 --> 01:06:21.921
That's what is very, very important in your life to have it.

01:06:22.421 --> 01:06:23.796
And when it is free --

01:06:24.421 --> 01:06:27.171
you can't pay for it, how much can you pay?

01:06:29.795 --> 01:06:32.795
-- when it is absolutely free,

01:06:33.171 --> 01:06:36.796
why don't you take your Self-realization,

01:06:37.546 --> 01:06:40.421
and why don't you grow?

01:06:40.921 --> 01:06:44.046
Instead of fighting in the name of religion.

01:06:47.046 --> 01:06:50.546
Every religion has said "You know thy Self."

01:06:53.795 --> 01:06:56.046
Mohammed Sahib has said very clearly,

01:06:56.546 --> 01:07:00.046
"At the time of resurrection your hands will speak."

01:07:01.671 --> 01:07:03.795
Are they speaking?

01:07:05.046 --> 01:07:07.296
Hindus know about it,

01:07:07.795 --> 01:07:10.796
that we have to get our Self-realization.

01:07:11.546 --> 01:07:15.795
No use just listening to these babajis and giving them money.

01:07:19.921 --> 01:07:25.671
All this kind of rituals

01:07:26.796 --> 01:07:29.796
that we have been doing, our forefathers have been doing:

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:32.421
what have we achieved? Nothing.

01:07:35.421 --> 01:07:38.546
So now, it's important for us to know

01:07:38.921 --> 01:07:44.795
that we have to have our evolution,

01:07:46.421 --> 01:07:49.795
reaching to the point of Self-realization.

01:07:51.671 --> 01:07:54.795
If we were perfect there would have been no problem

01:07:56.296 --> 01:07:59.046
If we were self-realized people

01:07:59.546 --> 01:08:02.046
there would have been no problem.

01:08:03.546 --> 01:08:05.795
All kinds of selfishness,

01:08:06.421 --> 01:08:11.921
all kinds of limits we have put upon ourselves,

01:08:12.671 --> 01:08:15.421
all kinds of conditioning and ego

01:08:15.921 --> 01:08:21.795
which has been working our life and have been ruining us,

01:08:22.046 --> 01:08:25.296
we have to get over it.

01:08:25.795 --> 01:08:28.546
And once you get over it, you get united.

01:08:28.796 --> 01:08:31.671
Nobody has to tell you that you get united.

01:08:32.046 --> 01:08:35.795
You lose all misidentifications.

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:39.171
Your misidentifications are that,

01:08:39.671 --> 01:08:41.795
that "we belong to this country,

01:08:41.921 --> 01:08:43.796
we belong to this religion, we belong to that."

01:08:44.296 --> 01:08:46.546
You belong to nothing.

01:08:48.046 --> 01:08:51.296
You belong to the Kingdom of God.

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:54.796
That's what you have to achieve,

01:08:55.546 --> 01:08:57.795
and you should be one there.

01:08:58.296 --> 01:09:02.046
But if you like story-telling, there's no end to it.

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:04.671
But you are wasting your time.

01:09:04.796 --> 01:09:06.796
The time is running short.

01:09:07.546 --> 01:09:09.546
I've been now here for the last,

01:09:09.921 --> 01:09:11.921
I don't know, twenty years or so.

01:09:12.546 --> 01:09:14.795
I worked very hard,

01:09:15.296 --> 01:09:19.171
but what I find that people don't realize

01:09:19.546 --> 01:09:21.546
what they are supposed to do.

01:09:25.796 --> 01:09:30.796
They like people who will just say something very simple

01:09:31.546 --> 01:09:34.546
-- all right, it's a little entertainment.

01:09:35.796 --> 01:09:41.546
So the whole humanity has to understand

01:09:42.921 --> 01:09:48.796
that destiny of destruction is to be avoided.

01:09:49.546 --> 01:09:52.796
Complete destruction is to be avoided.

01:09:54.296 --> 01:09:59.046
And very simple is that you enter into the Kingdom of God

01:09:59.795 --> 01:10:02.795
-- which is very easy: you don't have to pay anything,

01:10:03.296 --> 01:10:05.671
don't have to work out anything.

01:10:07.046 --> 01:10:09.171
You take your Self-realization,

01:10:09.795 --> 01:10:15.171
and then at home you spend about ten minutes meditating.

01:10:17.671 --> 01:10:23.546
Only your mind is all the time justifying your misbehavior.

01:10:23.921 --> 01:10:27.795
I call it "misbehavior" because it's against you.

01:10:28.171 --> 01:10:32.795
It's against God's wish,

01:10:33.795 --> 01:10:36.796
it's against humanity

01:10:37.296 --> 01:10:40.921
and it will destroy all the human beings.

01:10:42.796 --> 01:10:47.296
All these misidentifications have to be dropped,

01:10:47.795 --> 01:10:51.171
and you have to know that we are all one.

01:10:52.421 --> 01:10:56.795
We are all one, we are all global,

01:10:58.171 --> 01:11:02.046
we are not separated by color,

01:11:02.546 --> 01:11:06.795
race or religion, nation -- no.

01:11:08.171 --> 01:11:09.795
We are all one,

01:11:09.921 --> 01:11:14.421
and that oneness should not be established by slogans

01:11:15.795 --> 01:11:17.296
or by shouting,

01:11:17.795 --> 01:11:21.296
but should be that oneness is to be felt within.

01:11:24.171 --> 01:11:26.796
It's not artificial.

01:11:27.296 --> 01:11:30.795
It has to be real, very real oneness,

01:11:31.171 --> 01:11:33.795
and that comes to you once you realize

01:11:34.046 --> 01:11:37.046
that you are part and parcel of the whole.

01:11:39.421 --> 01:11:45.421
Religions have brought you up to this point of awareness

01:11:45.796 --> 01:11:49.921
-- not for fighting, not for killing.

01:11:53.046 --> 01:11:55.171
Why, why?

01:11:55.795 --> 01:11:58.921
Human beings have diverted themselves.

01:11:59.421 --> 01:12:04.296
Because of complete ignorance of righteousness.

01:12:05.421 --> 01:12:14.046
Because of complete greed of oneself:

01:12:15.546 --> 01:12:21.421
oneself, just yourself, or your family at the most,

01:12:21.796 --> 01:12:24.171
or your relation.

01:12:26.421 --> 01:12:28.713
Why do you want to delimit yourself?

01:12:28.879 --> 01:12:30.795
You are the spirit.

01:12:31.213 --> 01:12:37.795
Spirit is the ocean, ocean of knowledge,

01:12:39.046 --> 01:12:41.671
is the ocean of love,

01:12:42.795 --> 01:12:45.671
is the ocean of all blessings.

01:12:46.921 --> 01:12:49.796
So we have to decide.

01:12:50.421 --> 01:12:53.046
Today I have to request you,

01:12:53.671 --> 01:12:56.421
that there's not so much time left.

01:12:56.921 --> 01:13:01.796
We have to decide that we have to become the spirit

01:13:02.421 --> 01:13:05.171
That's all the religions have taught.

01:13:05.671 --> 01:13:12.171
But how to do it was not so much explained,

01:13:13.795 --> 01:13:15.671
and it didn't work out.

01:13:16.046 --> 01:13:19.921
Some of them did get it but they were outcasted.

01:13:20.546 --> 01:13:22.546
Nobody listened to them.

01:13:22.921 --> 01:13:26.046
Even people killed them and tortured them, crucified them.

01:13:27.546 --> 01:13:34.546
But now, please, all of you try to understand

01:13:34.921 --> 01:13:37.296
the value of your life.

01:13:38.546 --> 01:13:40.796
Why are you a human being?

01:13:41.171 --> 01:13:43.046
Why are you created?

01:13:43.671 --> 01:13:45.671
What is the purpose behind it?

01:13:45.921 --> 01:13:50.546
Are we going to be driven by nonsensical ideas?

01:13:51.921 --> 01:14:01.296
Are we going to be finished by all sorts of dividing factors?

01:14:01.796 --> 01:14:06.546
No, no, we are all going to get your Self-realization,

01:14:07.796 --> 01:14:11.171
and we are going to understand the value of our life.

01:14:13.171 --> 01:14:17.296
The problem is, you'll get your realization

01:14:17.671 --> 01:14:21.546
in the sense the power within you will rise.

01:14:21.921 --> 01:14:23.795
It's very well organized;

01:14:24.171 --> 01:14:27.296
actually, God is a great creator.

01:14:27.795 --> 01:14:33.546
How He has balanced and how it works out is remarkable.

01:14:34.046 --> 01:14:36.795
Every individual He has done it.

01:14:37.296 --> 01:14:42.296
With that happening, is not sufficient.

01:14:43.795 --> 01:14:46.795
You enter into, say, a palace

01:14:47.296 --> 01:14:50.796
and then you go round and see for yourself

01:14:51.296 --> 01:14:53.671
how beautiful you are,

01:14:54.171 --> 01:14:57.421
what beautiful things God has made for you.

01:14:58.921 --> 01:15:01.421
Then grow into it.

01:15:01.795 --> 01:15:04.546
Once you have grown into it,

01:15:05.046 --> 01:15:10.421
then you will realize what a great thing you are:

01:15:11.671 --> 01:15:19.795
the greatest gem, the greatest person, so loving.

01:15:21.046 --> 01:15:22.795
There have been some

01:15:23.296 --> 01:15:26.421
-- they have become just statues.

01:15:26.796 --> 01:15:32.296
Nobody tries to understand what were they doing,

01:15:32.795 --> 01:15:34.421
how they were there.

01:15:36.921 --> 01:15:44.795
So, tonight we can have the experience,

01:15:46.171 --> 01:15:49.795
the experience of the spirit.

01:15:50.171 --> 01:15:53.921
Is a very unusual, rare thing.

01:15:54.421 --> 01:15:56.296
It never used to happen like that.

01:15:56.795 --> 01:16:00.296
But it is now, so why not take advantage of it?

01:16:02.546 --> 01:16:06.671
Please, be ready for that,

01:16:07.046 --> 01:16:11.171
accept it, take it, and become.

01:16:11.795 --> 01:16:13.796
Becoming is the point.

01:16:14.296 --> 01:16:16.796
What you become is the point.

01:16:17.296 --> 01:16:23.546
And what you make out of this whole human civilization

01:16:24.046 --> 01:16:27.671
is your problem, not Mine.

01:16:28.921 --> 01:16:31.296
I can help you.

01:16:31.795 --> 01:16:33.795
I can work it out.

01:16:34.046 --> 01:16:41.171
So I would request you all to now be ready for Self-realization.

01:16:43.796 --> 01:16:45.795
It's much better,

01:16:46.296 --> 01:16:49.796
but those who do not want to have cannot be forced.

01:16:51.795 --> 01:16:54.671
So it's better such people leave,

01:16:55.046 --> 01:16:58.171
leave the hall if they don't want to have.

01:17:01.796 --> 01:17:03.795
May God bless you all.

01:17:30.795 --> 01:17:33.421
Firstly, you don't have to do anything

01:17:36.296 --> 01:17:39.795
-- meaning also, don't think what I have said.

01:17:42.296 --> 01:17:47.171
Try to keep your thoughts very peaceful,

01:17:48.546 --> 01:17:52.671
and I'm sure all of you can get your Self-realization.

01:17:54.296 --> 01:17:56.795
But how many will grow?

01:17:57.296 --> 01:18:01.796
Because you have to come to the follow-up,

01:18:03.296 --> 01:18:07.421
then you have to practice it in the centers

01:18:07.921 --> 01:18:10.546
-- and it works out.

01:18:11.046 --> 01:18:14.921
Little bit time you have to give to yourself,

01:18:15.795 --> 01:18:19.171
and to this global problem.

01:18:20.795 --> 01:18:23.171
You have to dedicate yourself to that.

01:18:23.795 --> 01:18:27.795
Is very important: you have to dedicate yourself.

01:18:28.421 --> 01:18:31.671
That doesn't mean that you have to become sanyasi

01:18:31.921 --> 01:18:35.046
or you have to be busy with this for twenty-four hours -- nothing.

01:18:35.671 --> 01:18:41.171
But this dedication will make you so much

01:18:43.171 --> 01:18:44.921
one with yourself,

01:18:45.546 --> 01:18:47.795
with the whole universe,

01:18:48.296 --> 01:18:51.921
that I don't have to tell you that you dedicate

01:18:52.421 --> 01:18:55.421
-- you'll dedicate by yourself.

01:18:58.795 --> 01:19:01.795
So please don't stay here

01:19:02.046 --> 01:19:04.421
if you don't want to have Self-realization.

01:19:04.921 --> 01:19:06.796
Nothing will happen to you.

01:19:07.421 --> 01:19:12.671
Please leave the hall in case you don't want Self-realization.

01:19:26.046 --> 01:19:31.796
What you have to do is not to do anything;

01:19:33.546 --> 01:19:36.171
to put just your hands towards Me.

01:19:38.171 --> 01:19:41.171
Of course, if you are wearing shoes better take them out,

01:19:41.795 --> 01:19:44.671
because Mother Earth is very important.

01:19:46.171 --> 01:19:48.796
Please put both the hands towards Me.

01:20:02.796 --> 01:20:04.796
You don't have to pray,

01:20:05.296 --> 01:20:06.795
you don't have to say anything; just

01:20:07.296 --> 01:20:09.795
put your hands towards Me, just like this.

01:20:23.796 --> 01:20:26.795
Now please close your eyes.

01:20:27.421 --> 01:20:32.546
It is important. Please close your eyes.

01:20:42.421 --> 01:20:47.296
This power, kundalini, is placed in the triangular bone,

01:20:49.795 --> 01:20:53.795
known as sacrum, means "sacred",

01:20:54.296 --> 01:21:03.296
and it rises through six centers of the parasympathetic,

01:21:03.796 --> 01:21:07.296
and ultimately pierces through

01:21:11.421 --> 01:21:14.296
the fontanel bone area

01:21:14.671 --> 01:21:17.046
which was a soft bone in your head,

01:21:17.795 --> 01:21:20.046
on top of your head.

01:21:25.046 --> 01:21:28.296
When you were a child, it was a soft bone.

01:21:28.796 --> 01:21:31.795
It pierces through that,

01:21:33.546 --> 01:21:36.421
and enters into the subtle energy

01:21:38.421 --> 01:21:45.921
of all-pervading Power of divine love.

01:21:48.795 --> 01:21:51.546
They call it by different name.

01:21:52.046 --> 01:21:57.171
They call it "Paramachaitanya" -- some call it "chaitanya."

01:21:58.795 --> 01:22:02.171
Some call it as "ruh."

01:22:02.795 --> 01:22:08.795
You may call it by any name -- is the love, love of God.

01:22:10.546 --> 01:22:12.796
Once you get connected with you,

01:22:14.171 --> 01:22:18.171
when you start feeling on your fingers

01:22:20.421 --> 01:22:22.296
some sort of a breeze.

01:22:22.795 --> 01:22:25.795
First some people will get hot, doesn't matter;

01:22:27.296 --> 01:22:29.421
but then it cools down

01:22:29.795 --> 01:22:33.546
and you get the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, as they call it.

01:22:36.171 --> 01:22:38.296
And it starts flowing.

01:22:40.171 --> 01:22:43.796
You can now raise your left hand

01:22:44.296 --> 01:22:47.921
on top of your fontanel bone area.

01:22:48.546 --> 01:22:51.795
Keep your eyes shut, and see for yourself

01:22:52.046 --> 01:22:56.546
if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head.

01:23:06.671 --> 01:23:08.421
You can move your hand.

01:23:11.671 --> 01:23:13.921
Now see with your right hand

01:23:14.795 --> 01:23:17.421
if there's a cool or a hot breeze

01:23:17.795 --> 01:23:20.921
coming out of your fontanel bone area,

01:23:21.421 --> 01:23:24.296
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:23:24.795 --> 01:23:26.296
See for yourself.

01:23:26.671 --> 01:23:28.921
Bend your head; better is to bend.

01:23:29.546 --> 01:23:31.546
Please bend your head.

01:23:33.296 --> 01:23:36.546
Again put your right hand towards Me

01:23:38.046 --> 01:23:43.796
and see for yourself with the left hand,

01:23:44.421 --> 01:23:50.296
see if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

01:23:50.795 --> 01:23:53.796
If it is hot it's all right, doesn't matter.

01:23:54.296 --> 01:23:57.671
It is coming because of the heat within you.

01:24:14.171 --> 01:24:19.171
Now all those who have felt cool or a hot breeze

01:24:19.795 --> 01:24:22.296
in their hands or on their fingers,

01:24:22.795 --> 01:24:25.421
or out of the fontanel bone area

01:24:25.795 --> 01:24:27.795
-- this is the real baptism --

01:24:27.921 --> 01:24:30.795
please raise both your hands.

01:24:39.795 --> 01:24:41.171
Just imagine:

01:24:41.795 --> 01:24:45.671
you are the soldiers who are going to save the world

01:24:46.671 --> 01:24:48.795
from its destruction.

01:24:49.296 --> 01:24:51.421
Try to understand your importance.

01:24:52.921 --> 01:24:55.421
You can put down your hand.

01:24:55.796 --> 01:24:59.795
Everyone practically has felt it.

01:25:00.296 --> 01:25:02.296
That means you are already matured

01:25:02.795 --> 01:25:04.671
to get your spiritual life.

01:25:04.921 --> 01:25:07.671
You are just on the brink of it.

01:25:08.171 --> 01:25:10.296
That's how you got it.

01:25:10.795 --> 01:25:15.796
It's last jump to reality.

01:25:16.296 --> 01:25:20.795
Now, you should know what is this, what are you,

01:25:21.795 --> 01:25:23.796
what is your spirit

01:25:24.796 --> 01:25:28.671
and what you can do; what are your powers are,

01:25:28.921 --> 01:25:31.046
what are spiritual powers.

01:25:31.546 --> 01:25:33.296
For this I would request you

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:36.171
to first to come to the follow-up program,

01:25:36.671 --> 01:25:41.421
and after that you can join any one of the centers

01:25:41.795 --> 01:25:44.921
which are closer to you and work it out.

01:25:45.546 --> 01:25:47.796
We have to work for the whole world.

01:25:49.296 --> 01:25:51.796
You should know there are eighty-five countries

01:25:52.296 --> 01:25:54.795
which are following Sahaja Yoga.

01:25:55.296 --> 01:26:00.546
And surprisingly, black country like Benin,

01:26:00.796 --> 01:26:03.795
we have twenty thousand Sahaja yogis.

01:26:04.171 --> 01:26:06.921
Only three years back I started there.

01:26:07.421 --> 01:26:11.795
And in England it's more than sixteen years

01:26:12.296 --> 01:26:16.796
I've been working here, and after that also:

01:26:17.296 --> 01:26:19.921
all the time, every year.

01:26:20.546 --> 01:26:22.046
But somehow

01:26:27.671 --> 01:26:32.421
their growth is very much there,

01:26:33.795 --> 01:26:41.546
but not subtle growth, not within ourselves.

01:26:45.796 --> 01:26:51.546
The growth is within, and you'll enjoy,

01:26:52.046 --> 01:26:54.795
very much enjoy the reality.

01:26:55.171 --> 01:26:58.921
The reality is beautiful, absolutely beautiful.

01:27:00.546 --> 01:27:02.421
May God bless you.

01:27:07.046 --> 01:27:08.796
They want to sing one song

01:27:09.546 --> 01:27:13.046
which was written in the twelfth century

01:27:13.546 --> 01:27:16.795
by a saint in India and is sung in all the villages,

01:27:17.046 --> 01:27:19.671
but nobody knows the meaning of that.

01:27:20.796 --> 01:27:24.796
The meaning is that "Oh Mother,

01:27:25.421 --> 01:27:27.921
give me the union, 'Jogwa'

01:27:28.671 --> 01:27:29.921
-- give me the union.

01:27:31.296 --> 01:27:35.796
I will give up my bad habits. I'll give up my temper. I'll give ..."

01:27:36.421 --> 01:27:37.795
You don't have to do it.

01:27:38.046 --> 01:27:40.795
Now you'll give up automatically.

01:27:42.296 --> 01:27:45.171
The light that you'll have, itself,

01:27:45.546 --> 01:27:49.296
automatically you will give up, automatically.

01:27:49.795 --> 01:27:51.546
You don't have to do anything.

01:27:51.796 --> 01:27:54.546
But you have to meditate.

01:27:54.879 --> 01:27:58.795
About ten minutes, it's not much.
