00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.300
Today’s combination is very powerful.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:16.180
On the day of this special combination, which is called ‘Angaraki’-

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.620
‘Angaraki Chaturthi’ is the ‘charturthi’ [fourth day of lunar month] of ‘Krishna Paksha’ [waning phase of the moon].

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.400
On every ‘charturthi’ [fourth day] Shri Ganesha’s Birthday is celebrated.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.000
But if the ‘chaturthi’ falls on a Tuesday, it happens once in a while,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.700
sometimes once or sometimes twice or sometimes three times a year.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.320
If the ‘chaturthi’ falls on Tuesday then it is celebrated in a grand way.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.600
Today is the same ‘Yog’ [conjunction]

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.660
where on a Tuesday, we are sitting here in Ganapati Pule

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.140
where ‘Angaraki Yog’ is celebrated.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.760
Thousands of people come here to do the puja of Shri Ganesha.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.920
There was such a traffic jam that some sixty vehicles were in front,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.960
so we took a round-about road and came cause it’s no use going any faster.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.200
When something has to happen, it happens like this only.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.600
Till we understand this matter in Sahaja that whatever happens,

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.920
we should watch it with patience.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.740
There should be patience.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:38.060
At that time if you hurry or if you become nervous,

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.660
then the work will not happen.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.320
Have patience.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.640
Once you have patience, you will understand what to do and how to do.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.060
Rushing is against Sahaja.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.440
In Sahaja you should have patience.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.780
About this Sai Nath has told a lot – be patient.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.720
“Sai milat saburi mein” [you’ll find Sai in patience].

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.540
The word ‘saburi’ [patience] is a bit inappropriate I feel.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.800
It means that when something is happening,

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.280
you should forbear meaning waiting, watching.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:33.200
When there is forbearance then Paramchaitanya does the work

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.000
and you will come to know exactly what to do.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.620
How to go about? What you should do? What path to take?

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.760
But if you rush, then you will get stuck in your thoughts

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.580
and run around here and there. You will not get what you want.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.180
Today there is one more Yoga [union],

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.560
that it is also the birthday of Jesus Christ.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.380
I have told you several times that Jesus Christ is the incarnation of Shri Ganesha.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.060
About this you have the proof also in Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.580
Today being His [Shri Jesus Christ] birthday,

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.700
today also being the Other’s [Shri Ganesha] birthday and today being a Tuesday;

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:33.840
having such a great function and fireworks is a very big Yog [union].

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.400
That we have come here to the place of Mahaganapati

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.220
and are doing the puja of Mahavishnu.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.840
Now we have to understand the importance of Shri Ganesha.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.800
What is His significance that is expressed today?

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.620
Like I had told you earlier, ‘vinay’, which is called humility.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.700
‘Namrata’ [humility] is His special quality.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.440
One more special quality is wisdom.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:16.560
I wasn’t getting an equivalent word in Marathi, they told Me the meaning of wisdom will be ‘subudhi’.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.600
O.K let us say ‘subudhi’.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.640
All these things are gifted by Ganesha’s principle.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.040
But then one more quality is that,

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:40.140
He is a cool headed person.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.880
His walk is very cool. Like an elephant.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.060
In an elephant you see that it walks very slowly.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.340
The walk is so beautiful that if any lady walks nicely

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.420
she’s called ‘gajagamini’, meaning she walks like an elephant.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.420
Slowly lifting the legs, thinking where to keep the foot

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.300
o that no ant or animal comes under its feet.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.600
They walk taking care of these things.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.500
In the front they blow with their trunk while walking

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.980
so that something that come in their way may not get destroyed.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.560
Secondly, they eat only grass. They are so strong eating only grass

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:31.400
that wherever heavy work needs to be done, like carrying heavy load,

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.160
there only elephants are used.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:43.340
The significant quality of elephant is also that they do thing slowly.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.740
They do not do anything hastily.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:58.560
And one more significant quality is that their memory is very strong.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.500
Even if they see a child in a young age,

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.460
however old that person has grown, they recognize.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.560
In the same as on the left side because the working is of Shri Ganesha,

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:14.120
you also know that when your left side becomes weak, your memory fails.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:20.040
That’s why we always raise the left side when the memory fails.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.560
The reason is the principle of Ganesha in you is reduced.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:29.760
When you become right sided, your left side Ganesha principle keeps reducing.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.320
Those people who work a lot, do this do that;

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.720
their memory, you can see in their old age

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.420
it becomes a question whether they will be able to recognize themselves or not.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:47.060
That’s why Shri Ganesha specialty is that wisdom is there

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.120
but along with wisdom, His memory is excellent.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.180
He remembers everything. He has to remember.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:01.760
Because whatever is imprinted on the Kundalini, whatever written,

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.020
all that is done by Shri Ganesha.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.060
He has a pen in His hand and He writes with His pen.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.320
The pen is one of His broken teeth.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.360
From that He writes what type of a person you are?

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.780
What difficulties have you undergone? In your seeking where all you went?

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.580
What mistakes did you do?

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.160
Everything He writes in it [Kundalini].

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.360
When the Kundalini begins to rise, like a tape recorder with problems squeaks,

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.200
similarly you can see the squeaking of the Kundalini

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.140
when She passes through your chakras.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:39.880
That’s how you come to know in the person this chakra is spoilt or that chakra is spoilt.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.360
This is absolutely classic scientific matter.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.440
So, there is not only one principle of Ganesha,

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.920
that you stay chaste, be without sins.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:57.840
There are many principles and one of them is that there should be wisdom in you,

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.020
there should be ‘subuddhi’ [wisdom] in you.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.500
You should know what is good and what is bad.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.900
What is the significance of today’s Angaraki,

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:12.700
where special ‘Angarak Chaturthi’ is celebrated?

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:18.980
The significance is that Shri Ganesha Himself cools down the ‘Angaar’ [red hot coal].

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.640
If you see the Kundalini, It is also a type of fire.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:31.020
The mechanism of Kundalini is like flames.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:39.020
Because everything goes towards the Earth as you know cause of gravity,

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.500
everything goes towards the Earth.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:45.900
Only this flame moves upwards.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:51.820
Any fire moves upwards and everything else towards the Earth.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:57.340
Upward movement is there only for fire.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:02.820
That is because He can cool down the fire in you.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.760
He cools down the fire in two ways.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.900
One – He cools the Kundalini.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.780
He tells the Kundalini that this person has these problems,

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.960
but it is alright, you still please make him cross over [Realized].

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:24.540
Because Kundalini’s child is Shri Ganesha and the child in you is Shri Ganesha,

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:29.480
in the same friendliness, He persuades the Kundalini,

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:34.000
“You are the Mother and I wish that I be awakened in this person.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.760
You help Me”.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:42.240
She becomes cool thinking that My child is asking this.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:49.020
So whatever the heat and problems in us cools down.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.500
Like you must have heard that once Devi became very angry

00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:00.840
and She saw that in the world many people are doing very wrong things.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.960
She was very troubled, very much in grief, She thought,

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.440
“This entire Universe I have made, I shall destroy it”.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:14.440
Thinking like this She created destruction everywhere. She got very angry.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.840
When She started the dance [of destruction], Shri Mahadev thought,

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.020
“Devi is angry, She is in action,

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.580
now the world will be destroyed. What is the remedy?”

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:30.140
So, what He did, He places Their Own Son Shri Kartikeya under Her feet.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.960
As soon as She stepped on the child, Her long tongue came out and She felt,

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.060
“What am I doing?”

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:41.100
The One who was so red with anger, on seeing the child She completely calmed down.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:50.120
In the same way He [Shri Ganesha] cools down our Kundalini that you are giving birth to Your child.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.980
At this point of time anger is not good. In the same way.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.940
Sometimes you would have troubled Kundalini so much

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.280
that you went to wrong Gurus, we ourselves did something wrong.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.160
The poor Kundalini is shattered.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:08.020
Her support is Shri Ganesha Who pushes Her upwards.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.720
Kundalini can rise up only because of Shri Ganesha’s power.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:20.720
That is why He is called ‘Angaar’ [red hot coal] as He gives His power to the Kundalini.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:28.200
The fire in the Kundalini or the flames of Kundalini that rises are calm.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.820
You must have never heard that this kind of calm flames are also there.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:39.180
Very calm flames. They are of seven colours, but very calm.

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.720
You see in the Sahasrara, how calm they are.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.040
All this work is done by Shri Ganesha.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.600
In a way, He can also bring down your anger.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.200
He can take away your anger.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.760
When we get angry, we get carried away.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:07.920
We don’t even remember what we should do and what we shouldn’t do.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.840
In that state we can hit someone, beat someone,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.580
even murder someone, anything we can do.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:18.520
The control that comes at that time comes from Shri Ganesha.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.920
Shri Ganesha cools down your anger.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.620
You see even Isa Masih [Jesus Christ] was similar.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.620
He told, “Forgive everyone.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.980
Whoever troubles you, you get angry with the person.

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:38.340
But for once learn to forgive, forgive everyone”.

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:45.620
For those people who insulted Him, troubled Him and put Him on the Cross,

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.840
even for them He told His Father,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:57.080
“O Father, please forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing”.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.440
When Isa Masi [Jesus Christ] said that

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.860
then think those people who crucified Him, troubled Him so much,

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:09.040
even them He opted to forgive.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:13.500
This is one of His character, His nature.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.480
One more character of Isa Masih [Jesus Christ] –

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:20.220
when people were sitting in front of the temple and selling things;

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.600
like here also we have. When people go to temple,

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.200
there they will be selling different thing, then they offer to God.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.820
Example – they offer a coconut to God then gain they get it out and sell.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:32.640
They make business out of it.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.000
Then He took a whip in His hand and whipped everyone saying,

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.100
“You cannot do this business”.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:44.260
If you have to do, whatever is there it should be in a pure form.

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:48.880
Not that you are offering to God and getting it out and selling it.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.680
ou offer Garland to God, then bring it out again and sell it.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.540
This type of thing, He said is absolutely wrong.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:01.800
He got so angry that He took a whip in His hand and started whipping everyone.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.960
This is His other side.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:07.240
Similarly, there is another side to Shri Ganesha also.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.880
The other side of Shri Ganesha is that,

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:19.320
if any Rakshasa or evil troubles you or irritates you,

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:25.080
He is Ganapati – meaning the King of Ganas,

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.960
He destroys the rakshasas and evil people. He ruins them.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.820
He destroys them completely.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:38.400
You don’t have to tell Him anything. You need not inform.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:45.400
The Ganas are with you. They finish the people who try to trouble you.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:50.200
In Sahaja Yoga you remember that you are completely protected.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:55.560
No one can trouble you – only if you are in Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:59.500
They, the Ganas are always around you in all directions.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:03.340
They have come here also.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:19.260
They have put the veil of protection on you, completely covered you.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.040
You will not face any troubles.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.220
Then you call it miracle. “Mother I don’t know how I was saved.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.200
I don’t know what happened and how I was suddenly saved”.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:30.920
All this is the work of Ganas.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.980
When Ganas do this work,

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.440
then you understand that you really are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:42.000
If they don’t do this work for you, then you have to understand

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:44.900
that you have not yet become a complete Sahaja Yogi.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.560
One more thing about the Ganas is

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:51.440
that They are all the time working in our body.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:57.380
The work that happens outside the body, is only when you are a Realized soul.

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.160
When your connection is made with God,

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:05.320
then they look after your body, your money and all your things,

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.520
your kids are all looked after by them.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:11.820
Before that they live inside us as antibodies.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:16.900
And these antibodies are the ones who protect us from diseases

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.820
and because of them we can fight diseases.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:25.260
This chakra in the center heart, here is a bone called sternum bone.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:29.540
Till twelve years the antibodies are prepared

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.700
and they move around all over the body and are ready.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:37.680
Whenever there is a problem, sternum starts shaking and as soon as it shakes,

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.980
like there is a remote control, like that they come to know.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:48.680
And the person coming and attacking you, or anything attacking

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:56.160
or any virus is there or any type of disease entering your body, they fight with them.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.440
But when you go against the Mother,

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:05.320
going against the Mother means losing your morality, falling in virtue.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:08.380
Going against the Father means

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:15.900
that you are not working, you are not acting, you become lazy.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.900
This is the sin against the Father.

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:22.280
But sin against the Mother is when you lose your morality.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:28.280
Those who have lost their chastity, their [center heart] becomes very weak.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:33.520
That is why it becomes very difficult to set this chakra all right.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:39.200
And the people to fall like this, them becoming all right is difficult.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.020
Like AIDS disease.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:45.680
Such kind of diseases that we call venereal diseases.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.480
All these venereal diseases come from immorality.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.720
And diseases caused by immorality cannot be cured

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.660
till your Ganesha principle becomes alright.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.460
That why we should understand

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:07.140
that we should stay away from immoral behavior.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:13.060
We should keep our personality, our entire life away from immorality.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:17.780
We should always be drowned in chastity.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:24.160
Regarding chastity Isa Masih [Jesus Christ] has said something very great.

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:26.660
Because His place is in Agyna chakra,

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.780
He has told a very great thing about Agnya

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.500
that even in your eyes there should not be anything unchaste –

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:39.340
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:43.080
Even the eyes should be such that it should be pure.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:47.840
If the eyes are not pure, then Isa Masih [Jesus Christ] is not there.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.020
But if you see in foreign nationals,

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.860
we see that those who believe in Isa [Jesus Christ], they have bad eyes.

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.480
Looking at this woman, looking at that lady.

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.920
Then even the woman are looking at the men.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:03.500
Eyes are always roving. The eyes are never steady.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:10.040
Once this goes on, the dead spirits, move from the eyes.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:14.740
Once they [dead spirits] go into one person, then they [dead spirits] go to another.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:20.100
It is such a play that there is no enjoyment in that and the play keeps going on

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.920
and the person goes mad in this.

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.940
Isa Masih [Jesus Christ] has told a very sensitive thing about morality

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.940
that even your eyes should not be immoral.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:35.200
You cannot even look at another person with immoral eyes.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:42.540
This thing He told, there is a complete verse on chastity.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:46.060
Isa Masih [Jesus Christ] has only talked about chastity.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:51.460
Whenever He has spoken is mostly about how one can keep oneself chaste.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.360
How you can stand on morality.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:59.140
So, in Sahaja Yoga everything takes place in a Sahaj [natural] way

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.500
when you completely accept Shri Ganesha

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:06.640
and accept that this Shakti [power] should come to us.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.420
As such Shri Ganesha’s place is there on every chakra.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:15.000
That’s why I always tell you that on every chakra, a Vice Chancellor is seated.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:20.160
Chancellor Sir is seated and till the time He certifies, Kundalini will not rise.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.020
And He works on every chakra.

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:26.440
So, as I was telling about today’s Yog [conjuction],

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:30.300
that His second nature is that He is ‘Angaar’ [red hot coal].

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:35.260
This ‘angaar’ can be cooled down with ‘angaar’.

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:39.180
It can be cooled completely.

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:51.400
Like you have seen when Ravan spoke against Shri Rama,

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:54.500
then Lanka caught fire.

00:20:55.780 --> 00:21:03.900
Hanumanji is also born on Tuesday and He has nine great powers.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:08.780
Both of them together work like this.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:12.620
Especially if there is anger in a person,

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:18.920
then how to cool that anger Shri Ganesha knows that.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:28.700
Then He does such actions, such tricks that that person is defeated completely

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:33.520
and accepts, “I have made a mistake, I should not have done that”.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:38.840
So, when heated people are there, He can make then also all right.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:49.120
That’s why if someone has ‘mangli’ [born on Tuesday], they should wear coral.

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:55.540
Coral is also heating. Heat is removed by heat.

00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:01.160
If you see in countries where the heat is more, people eat more chilies.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:07.780
Wherever you go. If you go to India, South India food is so spicy

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.400
that you cannot eat.

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:17.180
Also, in China, south China – Cantone etc., lot of chilies are eaten.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:23.340
In the same way in Italy – in the south. In France – in the South they eat a lot of chilies.

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:28.660
Why do they eat? Because chilies remove spice, heat removes heat.

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:34.820
That’s why they eat chili, so that they sweat a lot and remain cool.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:40.300
In the same way Shri Ganesha also sets right your heat from His heat.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:51.120
Like this He shows his anger [greatness] cause of which you yourself cool down.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:58.040
In all these diseases lot of heat is generated

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:02.540
and the person becomes delirious cause of the heat.

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:06.520
It is right that we treat this heat –

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:13.740
do puja of Shri Ganesha and we should be specially surrendered to Him.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:18.640
Today I feel is a great conjunction that these three things have fallen on the same day;

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.520
that today is the birthday of Isa Masih [Jesus Christ],

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:25.220
today is Tuesday and today is also the birthday of Shri Ganesha.

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:28.080
And all of you have come to Ganapatipule.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:34.420
Everything has happened in such a way naturally

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:37.580
that it feels like a miracle has taken place.

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:40.120
A very big miracle that all have come.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:45.180
But due to that there was a problem that the crowd was so much

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.780
that we got stuck in traffic jam and it got late.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:51.860
But delay or anything that happens, is a matter of patience.

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:57.100
I always think whatever time is fixed for us the puja will happen only at that time.

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:59.280
It cannot take place before that.

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:04.880
Why try to change the destiny? What is the use of fighting with it?

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:09.360
Whatever is, it is. Whenever the puja has to take place it will.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:13.760
In that if you start, puja is not taking place, this was the time.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:18.540
We are not slaves of the clock. But there are so many advantages of this.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:24.720
You will come to know in future that if you don’t do servitude of time,

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.040
Sahaja Yoga can be spread very much.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.920
But the person who is time bound, he can never spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.840
He keeps thinking, “At this time I have to do this”, “At that time you have to do that”.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.460
Such a person does not have time for Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:42.280
But the person who says, “He has to do Sahaja Yoga” – entire time is available for him.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.240
Everything happens very nicely.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:52.440
Only thing is you should have the experience and after experience you should have faith.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:59.900
So many things happen. Many people tell Me their miracles from morning till evening.

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:04.400
“Mother I was worried, I am going, when I’ll meet? When she’ll come?

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.820
But saw the person walking in front of me”.

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:15.020
Whatever desire that comes to your mind can be fulfilled. It is a matter of faith.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.840
By faith, there is no blind faith in Sahaja Yoga. There’s absolutely no blind faith.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:23.100
There is faith where you see everything with your own eyes.

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:27.520
After seeing everything if you don’t believe, what can you say for that?

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:35.640
It can be said that you are very untruthful or you lie or you are stupid.

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.440
These three things are possible.

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:42.300
You are seeing everything, you are understanding that things are taking place.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:47.260
After that also you do not believe, then there is something wrong with you.

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:54.240
On seeing all this you can think how dynamic Shri Ganesha is.

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:58.560
In Maharashtra there are eight ‘Ashtavinayak’ [8 Ganeshas]

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:04.380
because of which Maharashtra has received a lot of blessings.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:09.160
But still people are so mad that they keep running after these things.

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:15.000
They go on doing these things that they get stuck in rituals but do not achieve the truth.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:22.020
Now you people are lucky, are intelligent that you sought the truth and achieved it.

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:27.820
Now to achieve this you have to imbibe the characteristics of Shri Ganesha.

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:31.980
I was seeing thousands of people have come for Shri Ganesha’s puja.

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:36.200
Among them, who are His believers,

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:40.680
how many people have his qualities? I could not see anyone.

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:46.980
They drink alcohol, fight among each other, ill-treat women and trouble them

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:50.000
and then go for ‘Angarika’ of Shri Ganesha.

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:54.080
When you are such an ‘angaar’ [hot tempered person], then why have to come here?

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:57.600
Nobody thinks that if we believe in someone,

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.100
how many of the qualities of them have we imbibed?

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:04.240
“We have a lot of beliefs, we do puja of this [God] and we do puja of them [God]”.

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:08.340
Ok then how many qualities [of the God] have you got? Nobody thinks like that.

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:14.040
But the truth is if you believe in someone,

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:19.060
then you should imbibe their qualities.Till you develop those qualities,

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:23.680
you believe or not believe is the same, doesn’t make any difference.

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:27.920
Today we are doing the puja of Shri Ganesha.

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:30.660
There will be puja of Shri Ganesha and Gauri.

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:35.420
You will need to understand that Gauri is the Kundalini.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:38.000
Mahakundalini is Mahagauri.

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:48.240
Her work is that Her child who has been seeking for many years,

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:50.940
give him Self Realisation.

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.560
Give the child re-birth.

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:58.100
This is the work of Mahagauri Who is residing in all of you.

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:04.600
That’s why today we’ll do the puja of Ganeshji and Gauriji, later Devi puja.

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:07.860
Many blessing to all.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:19.420
In short, I told them what is so special about today,

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:23.080
tonight, is the time when, this is Tuesday,

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.700
on Tuesday Shri Ganesha was born.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:32.660
So they celebrate every fourth day of the moon

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:35.820
as the Shri Ganesha’s birth date

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.740
because He was born on the fourth.

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:41.500
But when this fourth falls on a Tuesday

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:44.760
then they think it’s a tremendous yoga,

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.920
because on Tuesday He was born.

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:54.640
On Tuesday, this fourth of the month has come,

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:59.300
so they just try to worship it as a something special day.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:03.600
Now I also told them what is the quality of Shri Ganesha,

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:05.240
which we see in Christ

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.000
and as Christ is the Incarnation of Shri Ganesha,

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:12.020
today remarkable thing is that the third yoga is

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:15.160
that today is the birthday of Christ.

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.700
And the fourth thing, which is very important,

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.960
is that you all should be here on such-and-such day on Ganapatipule.

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:28.400
So it’s very important day and that’s how we have to learn

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:31.680
that if you worship Ganapati or if you worship Christ,

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:35.460
we should try to think what qualities we have got within ourselves.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:43.460
Now regarding Jesus Christ – you know Him very well –

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:46.720
that He always talked of morality,

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:51.320
always talked of holiness,

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:54.340
of auspiciousness.

00:29:54.640 --> 00:30:01.540
And all these things, you see, the holiness and the complete

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.560
cleanliness within your being

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:09.760
is to such an extent that, I said, He said that,

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:12.600
“Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.”

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:17.180
So Shri Ganesha also was against the adultery.

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:20.580
Any kind of adultery He was against

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:24.820
and that’s why those people who indulge into adulterous life suffer,

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:26.480
suffer very badly.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.600
It’s rather difficult to cure them.

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:32.660
All these diseases which are incurable of Ganesha’s problems

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:34.960
are really difficult, because

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.180
here you have insulted Shri Ganesha

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.200
and that’s why He gets angry with you.

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:44.120
Now, His style is of two type(s).

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:48.220
One is by which He soothes you down, He soothes your Kundalini

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:51.960
and the second one is where He really gets angry with you

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:54.100
and tries to punish you.

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:58.920
These two qualities here, so one has to be very careful

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:01.640
when you are dealing with your morality.

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:05.120
The morality should be a part and parcel of your being.

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:07.620
That you should be proud that you are moral

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.580
and that you should try to lead a very moral life

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.720
without torturing anybody, without troubling anybody.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.040
In Sahaja Yoga, I hope it is all very clear cut

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:20.260
that we have to lead a very, very moral life.

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:23.140
Of course, all My lecture can be translated later

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:24.980
and I hope you’ll be able to enjoy it.

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.680
But this is the best part of it,

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:30.160
that today we have the birthday of Christ,

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.100
the birthday of Shri Ganesha

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.560
and also on such a date

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:40.580
which is so well-worshipped and regarded as something important in India.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.580
May God bless you all!
