1
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:24,550
Today in the land of Shri Krishna

2
00:19:25,758 --> 00:19:30,633
we are celebrating the birthday of Shri Ganesha.

3
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:40,550
Is something very unprecedented

4
00:19:41,675 --> 00:19:51,967
and of a very significant value

5
00:19:55,134 --> 00:19:59,259
that you should be celebrating

6
00:20:02,508 --> 00:20:10,259
the birthday of Shri Krishna’s Son in His own land.

7
00:20:11,883 --> 00:20:14,466
You know that Shri Ganesha incarnated

8
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,175
on this Earth as Mahavishnu

9
00:20:20,008 --> 00:20:25,591
and He was the Son of Radha,

10
00:20:28,134 --> 00:20:36,842
who incarnated as Lord Jesus Christ.

11
00:20:38,217 --> 00:20:41,758
So by celebrating this birthday

12
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:46,425
today you are recognizing the greatest truth

13
00:20:46,842 --> 00:20:55,675
that Lord Jesus Christ was the son of Shri Krishna.

14
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:04,758
There’s a story about it if you read in the Devi Mahatmayam,

15
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:14,384
how this Primordial Child took a form of an egg

16
00:21:14,842 --> 00:21:18,758
and half of it remained as Shri Ganesha

17
00:21:19,134 --> 00:21:26,425
and half of it became Mahavishnu.

18
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:39,591
In the evolutionary process all these happenings

19
00:21:41,424 --> 00:21:45,092
of the antiquities

20
00:21:48,259 --> 00:21:50,758
have been recorded

21
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,716
but today

22
00:21:55,008 --> 00:21:57,425
I feel so gratified that

23
00:21:57,758 --> 00:22:02,050
on the human level people have understood,

24
00:22:06,134 --> 00:22:14,758
Christ is the incarnation of Lord Ganesha.

25
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:21,050
He is the Eternal Child

26
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:25,842
but in the form when He came as Christ,

27
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:33,259
He came as the son of Shri Krishna.

28
00:22:34,175 --> 00:22:40,342
But when Parvati made Shri Ganesha,

29
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:46,424
He was the son of Parvati alone.

30
00:22:47,425 --> 00:22:50,342
There was no Father.

31
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:57,550
Parvati Herself wanted to have a child of Her own.

32
00:22:58,008 --> 00:23:03,425
There were angels who were dedicated

33
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:07,633
either to Vishnu or to Shiva,

34
00:23:10,217 --> 00:23:16,342
like ganas were dedicated

35
00:23:20,342 --> 00:23:22,591
to Shiva alone.

36
00:23:23,384 --> 00:23:29,134
So, She wanted to have Her own Son

37
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,384
who can

38
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:40,300
permeate

39
00:23:43,008 --> 00:23:47,758
Her powers on this Earth.

40
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:03,508
So to begin with when the Shakti created this Universe

41
00:24:04,008 --> 00:24:08,092
and Sadashiva was watching Her creation,

42
00:24:08,424 --> 00:24:14,758
the first thing She created on this Earth was innocence

43
00:24:15,384 --> 00:24:21,424
and the embodiment of that innocence was Shri Ganesha.

44
00:24:23,883 --> 00:24:29,175
The whole Universe was covered with innocence,

45
00:24:29,591 --> 00:24:35,384
which we call as Omkara.

46
00:24:40,342 --> 00:24:49,424
This innocence protected all the creation of the world

47
00:24:49,883 --> 00:24:53,716
and penetrated into all that is matter.

48
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:57,883
Matter is innocent.

49
00:25:01,217 --> 00:25:04,050
If you hit the matter, it will hit you back

50
00:25:04,466 --> 00:25:06,425
because it is built like that.

51
00:25:06,842 --> 00:25:10,758
It doesn’t want to harm you by any method

52
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,342
except that if you try to hit it,

53
00:25:13,675 --> 00:25:20,092
it hits you back, in its own nature.

54
00:25:22,008 --> 00:25:24,675
So it was called as Jada,

55
00:25:25,008 --> 00:25:32,883
the one that acts according to the built-in nature.

56
00:25:36,217 --> 00:25:41,842
Innocence in the animals is of another kind,

57
00:25:42,425 --> 00:25:44,342
where the animals do not know

58
00:25:44,633 --> 00:25:47,675
that they are committing crimes.

59
00:25:48,092 --> 00:25:50,008
Animals

60
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:56,425
when they say, kill an animal, another animal,

61
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:02,883
or trespass your properties,

62
00:26:05,425 --> 00:26:07,466
create nuisance all over,

63
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,134
they don’t know they are committing a sin

64
00:26:10,425 --> 00:26:14,259
or they are disobeying some laws.

65
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:21,758
They live with the laws that are built within them,

66
00:26:22,217 --> 00:26:26,716
that’s why they are called as pashus means bondage

67
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:29,675
– the pasha. Pasha means the bondage.

68
00:26:30,092 --> 00:26:37,384
They are under the bondage of the laws of God.

69
00:26:42,175 --> 00:26:48,050
Shri Shiva is called as Pashupati.

70
00:26:48,424 --> 00:26:55,925
Up to that stage the innocence remains intact

71
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:05,550
because there is no development of ego in them.

72
00:27:08,466 --> 00:27:10,883
So they are innocent.

73
00:27:11,259 --> 00:27:16,342
A tiger may eat a cow, still he is innocent

74
00:27:16,758 --> 00:27:19,175
or an elephant may trample

75
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:25,842
over a human body, still he is innocent.

76
00:27:29,967 --> 00:27:36,508
But when going to a higher state,

77
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:42,424
the Mother Shakti, the Primordial Mother thought

78
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,384
of creating a personality

79
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:53,883
who will protect the innocence of human beings.

80
00:27:54,384 --> 00:27:57,675
Above the matter, above the animals,

81
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:02,466
She created Shri Ganesha.

82
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,259
And you know the story of Shri Ganesha

83
00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:08,800
how He got the head of an elephant

84
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,175
– symbolizing that Shri Ganesha,

85
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,425
though He is a human being,

86
00:28:14,842 --> 00:28:18,716
He is like an animal as far as His head is concerned,

87
00:28:19,092 --> 00:28:24,633
that too of Shri Gajanana, in the sense that

88
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:30,217
He has got the head of an elephant

89
00:28:30,591 --> 00:28:37,800
which is the wisest animal in the animal kingdom.

90
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:44,134
So in such a head, which is innocent,

91
00:28:44,466 --> 00:28:46,300
ego cannot develop.

92
00:28:46,716 --> 00:28:51,591
There is no ego. It’s an ego-less state.

93
00:28:53,092 --> 00:29:01,883
But human beings were created in a different manner

94
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:11,008
and when carbon was placed to create aminoacids,

95
00:29:13,008 --> 00:29:18,050
it also settled them in motion,

96
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:23,508
a new type of evolution in human beings

97
00:29:24,092 --> 00:29:28,300
that at the Vishuddhi level human beings raised

98
00:29:28,591 --> 00:29:31,466
[his head] their heads like this.

99
00:29:31,967 --> 00:29:34,716
Animals’ heads are on the ground

100
00:29:35,384 --> 00:29:43,758
so the energy flows downward into Mother Earth

101
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:47,466
but when man raised his head above,

102
00:29:47,925 --> 00:29:52,466
against the energy of gravity,

103
00:29:53,466 --> 00:30:00,342
then a new complication started in the energy flow

104
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:05,425
and that is how at the Vishuddhi,

105
00:30:05,842 --> 00:30:11,384
a problem started where Kundalini

106
00:30:12,925 --> 00:30:15,384
could not

107
00:30:19,175 --> 00:30:21,050
nourish

108
00:30:21,424 --> 00:30:27,424
or look after that problematic Vishuddhi.

109
00:30:29,716 --> 00:30:33,550
The reason is when you raise your head

110
00:30:34,175 --> 00:30:36,342
from the Mother Earth,

111
00:30:36,758 --> 00:30:39,384
you remove yourself away

112
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,967
from the natural power of Mother Earth.

113
00:30:45,466 --> 00:30:50,716
When you take your Vishuddhi upward like that,

114
00:30:52,842 --> 00:30:55,300
you see the result of that in this country

115
00:30:55,716 --> 00:31:00,675
which is the country of Vishuddhi Chakra,

116
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:07,300
that you started going to machines which are against nature,

117
00:31:08,092 --> 00:31:10,466
extracting the nature,

118
00:31:11,175 --> 00:31:16,134
disturbing the nature by creating atomic bombs,

119
00:31:18,925 --> 00:31:23,466
by changing the atom, breaking it.

120
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:28,134
That means you went against the nature itself

121
00:31:28,425 --> 00:31:31,925
by raising your head.

122
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:36,217
But if it was done

123
00:31:39,425 --> 00:31:42,008
in complete surrender to God,

124
00:31:43,883 --> 00:31:48,342
with your bent head towards the Mother Earth,

125
00:31:48,758 --> 00:31:52,633
it would not have harmed you.

126
00:31:53,092 --> 00:32:01,300
But when you completely cut off yourself from that nature,

127
00:32:01,675 --> 00:32:06,425
which is so bountiful, which is so gracious.

128
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,466
Yesterday you saw the beautiful pictures

129
00:32:09,842 --> 00:32:14,591
of the nature that surrounds you in this country.

130
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:21,508
Such a rich country like America,

131
00:32:22,883 --> 00:32:27,716
without any gratitude towards its Creator

132
00:32:28,217 --> 00:32:30,883
raised its head upward

133
00:32:31,342 --> 00:32:36,591
– that’s how the Vishuddhi problem started coming up.

134
00:32:38,883 --> 00:32:45,050
In every walk of life, the whole social structure

135
00:32:45,508 --> 00:32:48,675
was built up to fight the nature,

136
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:52,842
not to go along with the nature.

137
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:59,675
So the first attack came on the innocence itself

138
00:33:01,008 --> 00:33:04,633
– on the Mooladhara itself.

139
00:33:05,175 --> 00:33:10,842
So the natural ways of Mooladhara were given up.

140
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:20,466
Marriage system has been here much before Christ,

141
00:33:21,758 --> 00:33:29,300
much before Abraham, much before Moses

142
00:33:31,508 --> 00:33:41,758
and a sanctified marriage, which was blessed by the society,

143
00:33:44,425 --> 00:33:49,217
was acceptable since long.

144
00:33:50,175 --> 00:33:53,800
But man in his arrogance

145
00:33:54,217 --> 00:33:58,384
raised his voice against the marriage,

146
00:33:58,842 --> 00:34:06,425
against the natural way of leading a life of sanity.

147
00:34:08,008 --> 00:34:18,384
If it was natural to be the way people lead their private life,

148
00:34:19,425 --> 00:34:26,259
why do they get all kinds of diseases?

149
00:34:27,758 --> 00:34:31,425
If you are a natural person, you don’t get any diseases.

150
00:34:34,633 --> 00:34:37,134
Because you are anti-nature,

151
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,925
that’s why

152
00:34:46,508 --> 00:34:50,175
in this country now many man and women were murdered

153
00:34:50,967 --> 00:34:53,050
for jealousy?

154
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:57,050
If it was natural

155
00:34:58,008 --> 00:35:00,300
to be in love with ten men and ten women

156
00:35:02,092 --> 00:35:04,092
then why jealousy?

157
00:35:06,175 --> 00:35:11,384
You should be happy, it’s very natural.

158
00:35:14,384 --> 00:35:17,633
Because the head was raised at Vishuddhi Chakra

159
00:35:18,008 --> 00:35:23,591
without surrendering to Shri Krishna,

160
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:38,175
anti-life, anti-biotic atmosphere started growing.

161
00:35:41,466 --> 00:35:47,466
And this kind of life has taken this great country,

162
00:35:47,967 --> 00:35:54,050
now to the brink of complete destruction.

163
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,134
The attack of innocence

164
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:06,134
is the greatest weakness of this country.

165
00:36:07,342 --> 00:36:16,384
Not to value the power of chastity and a chaste life

166
00:36:18,675 --> 00:36:26,050
is the biggest mistake that was created by the people

167
00:36:26,466 --> 00:36:31,508
who started all kinds of trends and fads.

168
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:38,842
Ganesha is the root of Creation.

169
00:36:39,466 --> 00:36:43,259
When you go against Shri Ganesh

170
00:36:43,675 --> 00:36:48,508
you start losing your roots, you have no roots at all.

171
00:36:49,134 --> 00:36:53,550
Then you get drifted into anything stupid,

172
00:36:53,967 --> 00:36:58,842
anything new that comes up.

173
00:36:59,633 --> 00:37:07,134
So much so that a person like Freud was worshipped

174
00:37:08,008 --> 00:37:11,300
and they forgot Christ,

175
00:37:11,675 --> 00:37:15,466
who said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.”

176
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:20,842
Ganesha to that level, that even the eyes have to be innocent.

177
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:26,342
There should be no lust in your eyes.

178
00:37:29,175 --> 00:37:33,092
But arrogance

179
00:37:34,883 --> 00:37:36,842
made them feel, “What’s wrong?

180
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:40,967
What’s wrong in this? What’s wrong in this?”

181
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:49,050
Now the whole country is facing a great crisis

182
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:57,883
because of arrogant enterprises.

183
00:38:00,591 --> 00:38:11,092
Still they make a martyrdom out of all that is destructive.

184
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:20,591
It’s a very great responsibility on the Sahaja yogis

185
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:26,175
who live on the land of Shri Ganesha.

186
00:38:26,591 --> 00:38:36,925
But for the people who live in the land of Shri Krishna,

187
00:38:37,342 --> 00:38:45,384
the responsibility is absolutely on your neck

188
00:38:47,134 --> 00:38:52,425
and you can’t get out of it.

189
00:38:54,424 --> 00:38:57,633
Unless and until you understand the importance

190
00:38:58,008 --> 00:39:01,217
of innocence in your life

191
00:39:01,591 --> 00:39:07,175
you cannot save this country whatever I may try to do for it.

192
00:39:07,591 --> 00:39:11,925
It’s only you who are going to save it.

193
00:39:12,425 --> 00:39:19,883
It’s only you who are going to make it.

194
00:39:22,758 --> 00:39:24,758
When the Kundalini rises

195
00:39:25,424 --> 00:39:28,425
Shri Ganesha is awakened in you,

196
00:39:29,384 --> 00:39:34,424
the Ganesha whom you never respected,

197
00:39:35,259 --> 00:39:43,466
slowly comes up from His slumber,

198
00:39:44,134 --> 00:39:48,800
out of the hurt and the injuries inflicted on Him,

199
00:39:49,134 --> 00:39:52,800
still He stands up.

200
00:39:53,466 --> 00:39:54,300
But still weak,

201
00:39:58,508 --> 00:40:01,425
How are we going to nourish it?

202
00:40:01,883 --> 00:40:09,384
How are we going to look after its growth?

203
00:40:12,675 --> 00:40:20,175
The responsibility of Sahaja yogis of America is very great.

204
00:40:20,842 --> 00:40:25,925
They cannot cheat any more themselves.

205
00:40:26,384 --> 00:40:31,800
They cannot be satisfied with their arrogance.

206
00:40:32,259 --> 00:40:37,424
The mistakes have been grievous.

207
00:40:38,384 --> 00:40:43,092
So you have to take it up as a crusade

208
00:40:43,758 --> 00:40:45,925
against those mistakes

209
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,550
and to establish your Shri Ganesha in a full form

210
00:40:52,175 --> 00:40:55,716
so that He gives you the necessary balance

211
00:40:55,716 --> 00:41:00,466
and the roots to nourish yourself.

212
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,883
It is shocking first.

213
00:41:03,217 --> 00:41:06,425
I mean you just can’t understand;

214
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,842
it is impossible

215
00:41:10,967 --> 00:41:16,342
to see how you could accept such absurd ideas;

216
00:41:19,675 --> 00:41:25,883
how you could take to such funny things,

217
00:41:29,466 --> 00:41:35,175
which are obviously horrid.

218
00:41:41,675 --> 00:41:46,217
Are we not aware of certain words like prostitution?

219
00:41:46,633 --> 00:41:48,591
And all other dirty words that they use,

220
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:51,716
which I don’t want to say just now,

221
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:56,883
or they have lost their meanings?

222
00:41:58,591 --> 00:42:04,550
We were all aware of it, we all knew about it.

223
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:09,591
[Don’t do that … You should not.

224
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:15,425
When I’m speaking must be quiet, all right?]

225
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:22,384
Have we lost all wisdom from our minds

226
00:42:23,175 --> 00:42:26,384
that we cannot see

227
00:42:29,092 --> 00:42:31,842
what we have done to ourselves?

228
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:37,466
We have no self-respect.

229
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:46,008
Arrogance to that limit is very dangerous,

230
00:42:47,424 --> 00:42:53,050
extremely unpredictable.

231
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:57,175
And God knows what can come through

232
00:42:57,508 --> 00:43:04,466
with all these ventures we have gone into.

233
00:43:07,842 --> 00:43:10,259
I would say for Sahaja yogis,

234
00:43:10,591 --> 00:43:16,134
I have given some instructions with people

235
00:43:16,508 --> 00:43:23,217
– how they should respect their privacy of life,

236
00:43:27,466 --> 00:43:31,425
specially the women of America.

237
00:43:32,134 --> 00:43:35,217
If they have to be the shaktis,

238
00:43:35,716 --> 00:43:42,300
they have to respect their chastity.

239
00:43:43,967 --> 00:43:53,050
But so surprising that when we see outside

240
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:59,092
all these things happening, even after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

241
00:43:59,716 --> 00:44:06,967
some of us try to be one of them who are going to hell.

242
00:44:07,883 --> 00:44:10,342
If you have to save them,

243
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:19,466
then try to fix your positions, properly.

244
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:26,550
Shri Ganesha has four hands

245
00:44:27,967 --> 00:44:35,466
and the hand that carries the destructive weapon of Parasha

246
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,217
is the one you have to be careful about.

247
00:44:47,259 --> 00:44:49,800
That is His job

248
00:44:52,591 --> 00:44:54,967
and if you neglect Him,

249
00:44:57,384 --> 00:44:59,800
that force will act

250
00:45:01,466 --> 00:45:04,300
and act so vehemently

251
00:45:04,925 --> 00:45:07,424
that despite your realization

252
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,633
you may not be able to save yourself.

253
00:45:13,259 --> 00:45:16,300
Do not take your realization for granted.

254
00:45:16,716 --> 00:45:19,300
Unless and until your Ganesha is settled,

255
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:22,967
your realization has no meaning at all.

256
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,591
Watch yourself,

257
00:45:27,008 --> 00:45:30,134
have you got adulterous eyes?

258
00:45:34,217 --> 00:45:39,466
Have you got an adulterous mind?

259
00:45:43,092 --> 00:45:49,967
What is your expectation about Sahaja Yoga?

260
00:45:51,217 --> 00:45:54,716
So many think that in Sahaja Yoga God blesses you,

261
00:45:55,134 --> 00:46:01,134
then you must get a good amount of health,

262
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,424
money

263
00:46:06,883 --> 00:46:08,758
and position,

264
00:46:09,008 --> 00:46:10,842
power.

265
00:46:14,633 --> 00:46:21,967
The first thing you must ask for is the pure Ganesha,

266
00:46:22,342 --> 00:46:26,925
Nirmal Ganesha.

267
00:46:30,591 --> 00:46:35,925
“Oh, Mother, please give us

268
00:46:36,842 --> 00:46:42,425
the blessings of establishment of purity

269
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:48,758
in our Ganesha principle.”

270
00:46:50,175 --> 00:46:51,675
In relationships,

271
00:46:56,716 --> 00:46:58,967
in attitudes,

272
00:47:02,675 --> 00:47:04,425
in behavior,

273
00:47:08,633 --> 00:47:13,217
try to judge yourself, are you innocent?

274
00:47:17,342 --> 00:47:25,050
Christ has said anything against Him may be tolerated

275
00:47:25,508 --> 00:47:30,842
but nothing against the Adi Shakti.

276
00:47:31,758 --> 00:47:37,466
But I must tell you as your Mother, it’s not true.

277
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:42,259
Maybe against Me some things may be tolerated

278
00:47:42,716 --> 00:47:49,217
but nothing against Christ, the Lord,

279
00:47:49,716 --> 00:47:54,842
nothing against Lord Ganesha.

280
00:47:55,300 --> 00:48:00,758
Everything that is done against Him after realization

281
00:48:01,758 --> 00:48:05,675
will tell upon you

282
00:48:08,675 --> 00:48:13,800
and you’ll be thrown out of the realm of God,

283
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:19,008
as absolutely degraded people.

284
00:48:19,425 --> 00:48:23,424
That is one thing that will not be tolerated,

285
00:48:23,842 --> 00:48:30,466
will not be forgiven, will never be acceptable.

286
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:34,758
Whatever you have done in the past is finished now

287
00:48:35,175 --> 00:48:37,842
because you are a new bird.

288
00:48:38,259 --> 00:48:41,300
But after becoming this,

289
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:48,175
if you try to take to these wrong ideas

290
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:57,633
or to indulge into them, I cannot help you at all.

291
00:49:01,217 --> 00:49:06,550
After all Shri Ganesha is My Son

292
00:49:08,134 --> 00:49:12,259
because He is pure.

293
00:49:14,633 --> 00:49:18,134
Now He is not the only son I have.

294
00:49:18,508 --> 00:49:21,633
I have so many sons and daughters

295
00:49:22,008 --> 00:49:24,466
and I have made you in the same way

296
00:49:24,466 --> 00:49:28,758
as I created Shri Ganesha, without the Father,

297
00:49:29,342 --> 00:49:32,425
on My own.

298
00:49:35,758 --> 00:49:40,092
To your Mother nothing but purity of heart

299
00:49:40,425 --> 00:49:49,259
and purity of your body is going to please.

300
00:49:51,259 --> 00:49:55,008
Anything that is impure has to be thrown away.

301
00:49:55,384 --> 00:50:00,217
My name itself means purity.

302
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:03,508
You can do it.

303
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,425
You are empowered to do it.

304
00:50:05,758 --> 00:50:07,300
You have a Kundalini to do it.

305
00:50:07,633 --> 00:50:13,508
But the first thing you have to do is to cleanse that

306
00:50:15,675 --> 00:50:18,300
and the rest you don’t have to worry,

307
00:50:18,633 --> 00:50:22,633
Shri Ganesha will look after it.

308
00:50:23,175 --> 00:50:28,425
One chakra you keep clean, the rest is looked after.

309
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:36,800
All your incurable diseases right from

310
00:50:39,716 --> 00:50:43,758
all muscular troubles like mellitus and all that,

311
00:50:44,092 --> 00:50:49,092
all your incurable diseases right from cancer onwards,

312
00:50:51,424 --> 00:50:54,134
all your psychosomatic problems

313
00:50:56,008 --> 00:50:59,008
right from schizophrenia, everything

314
00:50:59,758 --> 00:51:03,925
come because of the disturbance in Mooladhara.

315
00:51:07,384 --> 00:51:10,300
When the roots are not all right,

316
00:51:11,716 --> 00:51:14,591
how can you cure the tree?

317
00:51:15,175 --> 00:51:16,967
If the roots are all right

318
00:51:17,424 --> 00:51:21,342
then any medicine can reach any center,

319
00:51:22,008 --> 00:51:26,217
any area, any place, any fruit.

320
00:51:28,008 --> 00:51:30,633
But if the roots are not all right,

321
00:51:31,925 --> 00:51:34,134
how can you work it out?

322
00:51:36,591 --> 00:51:39,259
Today you have called Me here,

323
00:51:39,591 --> 00:51:44,466
to worship Shri Ganesha, within Me.

324
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:53,425
Shri Ganesha within Me is a powerful identity.

325
00:51:55,217 --> 00:52:00,800
While worshipping Him you have to know

326
00:52:02,092 --> 00:52:07,675
that such a powerful thing

327
00:52:08,217 --> 00:52:12,175
you have to establish within yourself

328
00:52:13,758 --> 00:52:16,550
and by that establishment

329
00:52:19,092 --> 00:52:27,883
you have to manifest the powers of Shri Ganesha

330
00:52:32,259 --> 00:52:35,300
and the power of Shri Ganesha’s

331
00:52:37,466 --> 00:52:41,716
greatness is auspiciousness.

332
00:52:46,633 --> 00:52:51,342
It’s a coefficience;

333
00:52:52,424 --> 00:52:57,508
it’s a formula, we can say in scientific language,

334
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:04,175
that emits auspiciousness.

335
00:53:09,508 --> 00:53:16,050
It’s a magnet in the Mother Earth.

336
00:53:17,217 --> 00:53:21,134
The same magnet is within you,

337
00:53:21,466 --> 00:53:23,425
which is Shri Ganesha.

338
00:53:23,716 --> 00:53:26,175
You leave Me alone and I can tell you

339
00:53:26,466 --> 00:53:33,800
which is the north, south, east, west.

340
00:53:34,466 --> 00:53:37,425
Close My eyes, still I’ll tell you.

341
00:53:37,842 --> 00:53:40,800
You know there are so many birds who fly out

342
00:53:41,175 --> 00:53:44,092
all the way to Australia, to Siberia

343
00:53:44,425 --> 00:53:46,550
because they have that magnet with them,

344
00:53:46,883 --> 00:53:48,883
they have that innocence with them.

345
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,758
There are so many fishes,

346
00:53:51,134 --> 00:53:56,050
which have got actual magnet placed in them.

347
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:59,259
Scientists should find out.

348
00:53:59,675 --> 00:54:07,550
In the same way Shri Ganesha within us is magnetic.

349
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:17,092
So a person who has Shri Ganesha awakened within himself

350
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,092
becomes magnetic

351
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:34,716
and magnet attracts the steel

352
00:54:35,967 --> 00:54:41,300
– not dried leaves, does not – steel.

353
00:54:41,758 --> 00:54:45,217
And steel is like the Guru Tattwa.

354
00:54:45,633 --> 00:54:49,259
Is a man with the steel, say.

355
00:54:49,716 --> 00:54:55,925
“Man of steel” – a person who has character, conviction

356
00:54:56,424 --> 00:55:01,050
and who cannot be dominated by temptations,

357
00:55:01,425 --> 00:55:04,967
is a man of steel.

358
00:55:05,425 --> 00:55:13,633
So this magnet attracts the steel.

359
00:55:14,342 --> 00:55:21,008
Steel has only one badness, bad thing about it that it is

360
00:55:22,466 --> 00:55:28,633
not pliable, it’s rather dry

361
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:34,800
but the magnet attracts, means

362
00:55:36,175 --> 00:55:41,092
it creates that special quality in the steel

363
00:55:42,716 --> 00:55:45,842
that it moves towards the magnet.

364
00:55:50,925 --> 00:55:55,050
In the same way when this magnet is awakened within you,

365
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:58,466
you’ll be amazed.

366
00:55:58,967 --> 00:56:01,175
Instead of people running away from your ashrams

367
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:03,259
they’ll be running towards you.

368
00:56:03,675 --> 00:56:07,967
I find it impossible. I go to any house,

369
00:56:08,716 --> 00:56:13,425
if they come to know I am there, God save Me

370
00:56:14,134 --> 00:56:19,384
– anywhere, any place.

371
00:56:19,758 --> 00:56:24,217
So what is this magnet?

372
00:56:25,008 --> 00:56:28,633
Is pure love.

373
00:56:29,342 --> 00:56:31,716
Is pure love

374
00:56:32,134 --> 00:56:36,842
and the concept of pure love is that it doesn’t depend

375
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:41,092
on anything whatsoever but on itself.

376
00:56:41,508 --> 00:56:45,675
It is the support of itself.

377
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:49,842
It’s like light that spreads just by its own nature,

378
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:51,550
doesn’t want anything,

379
00:56:51,925 --> 00:56:53,758
doesn’t expect anything.

380
00:56:54,217 --> 00:56:59,842
Just spreads all over and enlightens other people’s hearts.

381
00:57:00,259 --> 00:57:06,134
That’s why they get attracted.

382
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:11,800
Those who have not even seen Me,

383
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,134
those who have not even known Me,

384
00:57:16,050 --> 00:57:18,175
just with My name, I’ve seen,

385
00:57:19,008 --> 00:57:22,716
places like Calcutta, we had such a problem, such crowds

386
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:25,175
that they said, “We have to call the police”.

387
00:57:25,466 --> 00:57:27,217
I said, "There's no need to call the police but

388
00:57:27,425 --> 00:57:29,092
we'll manage somehow.”

389
00:57:29,342 --> 00:57:30,883
In Poona we had such crowds

390
00:57:30,883 --> 00:57:34,425
that the fellow who gave us the hall got a fright.

391
00:57:34,508 --> 00:57:38,008
He said, “Mother, I’ll give You very big area

392
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,550
where You can sit down in a big open place

393
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:44,300
but I am sorry, my hall all will be finished.”

394
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:47,508
I said, “You don’t worry,

395
00:57:47,967 --> 00:57:50,550
everything will be in proper place.”

396
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:54,342
We had such crowds that people were sitting on the ground,

397
00:57:54,716 --> 00:57:59,300
on the staircase, everywhere and till I spoke

398
00:57:59,716 --> 00:58:05,716
nobody moved an inch, you see like a picture.

399
00:58:06,134 --> 00:58:08,967
And I spoke for one and a half hour.

400
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,092
Just like a picture.

401
00:58:11,508 --> 00:58:15,384
No movement of hand, feet, eyes – nothing.

402
00:58:15,716 --> 00:58:19,800
Just sitting like a picture.

403
00:58:20,342 --> 00:58:23,591
And the gentleman who owned that hall

404
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:28,092
had never seen such a thing before.

405
00:58:28,633 --> 00:58:31,342
Throughout for one and half hour,

406
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:34,800
no movement of any kind.

407
00:58:37,883 --> 00:58:42,008
What is it, that working, is the magnet.

408
00:58:42,508 --> 00:58:47,342
Even if you are the steel, it will attract

409
00:58:47,758 --> 00:58:50,092
but if you are a magnet then it will attract

410
00:58:50,508 --> 00:58:55,175
in such a way that it will never leave this magnet.

411
00:58:55,508 --> 00:59:00,800
So, for yoga it is important that you fix up your magnets

412
00:59:01,424 --> 00:59:11,800
of Shri Ganesha who is the child-like personality.

413
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,800
A child, there’s one child,

414
00:59:15,175 --> 00:59:18,633
everybody is attracted towards the child.

415
00:59:20,134 --> 00:59:23,508
One child gets stuck-up somewhere in the air,

416
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:29,050
whether you are a Russian, American or an Arab,

417
00:59:29,508 --> 00:59:31,716
everybody would be worried about the child.

418
00:59:32,175 --> 00:59:33,342
What’s happening to the child?

419
00:59:33,716 --> 00:59:38,633
They will not think: it’s an Arab child or an American child, no.

420
00:59:39,134 --> 00:59:43,675
Unless and until it’s a devil.

421
00:59:45,092 --> 00:59:47,050
Why this attraction for children?

422
00:59:47,466 --> 00:59:49,008
Because their magnets are intact.

423
00:59:49,425 --> 00:59:51,550
Their ego has not yet developed.

424
00:59:51,967 --> 00:59:55,008
Our ego developed, had to develop

425
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:59,424
because we had to decide in our own freedom,

426
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:03,092
what is right and what is wrong.

427
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:05,550
So the ego developed was all right.

428
01:00:05,967 --> 01:00:09,716
Up to a point we should have developed our ego.

429
01:00:10,259 --> 01:00:14,300
But we overdeveloped it and overdeveloped it,

430
01:00:14,633 --> 01:00:16,591
overlapped the superego also.

431
01:00:17,008 --> 01:00:19,425
No conditioning, nothing.

432
01:00:19,967 --> 01:00:21,842
We’ll do whatever we like.

433
01:00:22,217 --> 01:00:24,384
Today we are wearing a half-pant,

434
01:00:24,758 --> 01:00:27,675
tomorrow we will wear a long pant, all right.

435
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:31,842
Then we’ll cut our hair or we’ll do this, we’ll do that.

436
01:00:32,424 --> 01:00:34,342
No conditioning of any kind.

437
01:00:34,758 --> 01:00:40,050
All superego was also covered – ego.

438
01:00:42,175 --> 01:00:46,925
This ego would have been all right

439
01:00:47,424 --> 01:00:51,883
if you had kept your Ganesha tattwa.

440
01:00:52,508 --> 01:00:57,883
And what is that is the wisdom power of Ganesha.

441
01:00:58,384 --> 01:01:04,466
The second power of Ganesha is that He gives you wisdom.

442
01:01:05,134 --> 01:01:10,550
If you see a farmer and a big professor

443
01:01:11,008 --> 01:01:14,842
or a very well educated man

444
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,424
and talk to both of them. You’ll find the farmer

445
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:25,424
has much more wisdom than this, MAD PhD.

446
01:01:26,591 --> 01:01:29,675
Why? Because he deals with Mother Earth everyday.

447
01:01:30,134 --> 01:01:31,758
He knows the living process.

448
01:01:32,217 --> 01:01:37,550
He knows about the innocence of the Mother Earth.

449
01:01:38,633 --> 01:01:43,883
So an innocent person is the wisest among ...

450
01:01:44,342 --> 01:01:50,967
A child who is innocent is much wiser than

451
01:01:51,424 --> 01:01:56,175
ten ego-oriented people.

452
01:01:58,424 --> 01:02:03,550
So the second capacity of Shri Ganesha

453
01:02:04,008 --> 01:02:08,550
is that you become a wise person.

454
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:12,466
When you speak, people start looking at you.

455
01:02:12,842 --> 01:02:17,633
You speak like Kabira, you speak like Nanaka.

456
01:02:18,175 --> 01:02:29,342
You speak like something that makes people feel their spirit.

457
01:02:30,716 --> 01:02:34,384
This is what I call is a Sahaja yogi.

458
01:02:34,716 --> 01:02:38,550
A Sahaja yogi who does not have wisdom

459
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:42,217
is good for nothing.

460
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:45,550
He comes to Sahaja Yoga

461
01:02:45,925 --> 01:02:49,591
and he is like a bull in a china shop,

462
01:02:50,092 --> 01:02:52,217
goes on hitting this person, hitting that person

463
01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:55,217
and hitting that person.

464
01:02:55,633 --> 01:02:58,050
And when you ask these three wounded persons,

465
01:02:58,425 --> 01:03:00,175
they say, “That bull, the same bull”.

466
01:03:00,591 --> 01:03:02,300
Everybody reports about the same bull.

467
01:03:02,758 --> 01:03:07,342
“Oh, that’s the one, all right.”

468
01:03:10,384 --> 01:03:15,425
So it grants you wisdom.

469
01:03:16,967 --> 01:03:20,175
When you have the power of Shri Ganesha,

470
01:03:20,591 --> 01:03:22,800
your eyes are radiant.

471
01:03:23,259 --> 01:03:27,758
You get a spark in your eye, a light in your eye,

472
01:03:28,384 --> 01:03:31,092
when He is enlightening you;

473
01:03:31,466 --> 01:03:41,217
then you cannot look at anyone with lust and greed.

474
01:03:41,842 --> 01:03:45,050
But this glance is so powerful

475
01:03:45,424 --> 01:03:48,758
that even one glance is sufficient

476
01:03:49,217 --> 01:03:54,134
to purify thousands of people.

477
01:03:55,883 --> 01:04:00,424
Just the opening of the eyes are necessary

478
01:04:01,092 --> 01:04:04,925
and you find whole thing changes

479
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:08,591
into a beautiful morning

480
01:04:09,008 --> 01:04:15,092
from a complete dark night.

481
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:23,259
Glance can awaken the Kundalini.

482
01:04:24,175 --> 01:04:27,300
The Mother Kundalini cannot move,

483
01:04:27,716 --> 01:04:32,300
unless and until Shri Ganesha gives the permission.

484
01:04:32,883 --> 01:04:36,800
He is like the Vice-Chancellor sitting on all the chakras.

485
01:04:37,384 --> 01:04:45,758
He has to certify, “All right. Pass. Go,” on every chakra.

486
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:48,425
And when the Kundalini rises,

487
01:04:48,842 --> 01:04:54,633
Shri Ganesha is awakened, otherwise Kundalini cannot rise.

488
01:04:55,175 --> 01:04:57,092
But then when He sleeps down,

489
01:04:57,466 --> 01:05:02,633
Kundalini sucks, is sucked by Him.

490
01:05:07,758 --> 01:05:10,092
Now we think we have lost our innocence.

491
01:05:10,466 --> 01:05:14,425
That’s not easy to be lost. It is not destructible.

492
01:05:15,008 --> 01:05:22,508
Only thing what you have done is to cover it

493
01:05:22,967 --> 01:05:29,466
with something that cannot allow

494
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:34,008
Shri Ganesha’s principle to manifest in us.

495
01:05:34,508 --> 01:05:38,883
You have pushed it down. You have brought pressure on it.

496
01:05:39,424 --> 01:05:44,217
You have brought loads and loads of nonsense on it.

497
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:50,716
That’s all, but it never dies.

498
01:05:51,259 --> 01:05:58,342
It is an eternal principle of the whole universe.

499
01:06:03,466 --> 01:06:07,800
The another quality of a person who is endowed

500
01:06:08,384 --> 01:06:12,050
with Shri Ganesha’s powers is that

501
01:06:12,466 --> 01:06:15,008
He removes all the hurdles.

502
01:06:15,384 --> 01:06:21,092
If one person of this nature is in some place,

503
01:06:21,591 --> 01:06:23,967
all the rest of the people who are nearby

504
01:06:24,384 --> 01:06:28,842
will be saved if there’s an accident or if there’s any problem,

505
01:06:29,424 --> 01:06:34,842
which is destructive, all of them will be saved.

506
01:06:41,050 --> 01:06:44,424
You will find this happening.

507
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:51,800
He being the Ganapati, He is now the Master of all the Ganas.

508
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:55,591
He guides you.

509
01:06:56,092 --> 01:06:58,925
Sahaja yoga cannot workout without Shri Ganesha.

510
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:02,217
He is the one who is Sahaja.

511
01:07:02,633 --> 01:07:07,050
He is the one who creates all spontaneity of the world.

512
01:07:07,550 --> 01:07:10,008
He is the one who takes you to the right path.

513
01:07:10,425 --> 01:07:13,633
He is the one who gives you everything easily.

514
01:07:14,134 --> 01:07:17,175
He is the one who creates all the chamatkars,

515
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:25,342
all the magic, all the miracles of the world.

516
01:07:27,425 --> 01:07:33,384
He is the Ganapati. He is the one who is sitting on Ganas,

517
01:07:33,925 --> 01:07:41,591
in the sense that He is like the king of all the Ganas.

518
01:07:43,633 --> 01:07:45,425
The one who has pleased Shri Ganesha

519
01:07:45,883 --> 01:07:48,466
has pleased all the Gods and Goddesses

520
01:07:48,925 --> 01:07:50,633
because all the Gods and Goddesses

521
01:07:51,092 --> 01:07:55,300
are pleasing Shri Ganesha, so what is the need?

522
01:07:55,716 --> 01:07:57,633
And Shri Ganesha is very clever.

523
01:07:58,134 --> 01:07:59,384
He knows,

524
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:09,508
please His Mother is the only simple thing He has to do.

525
01:08:10,384 --> 01:08:13,424
To have all the powers of the world,

526
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:18,424
just keep the Mother pleased.

527
01:08:21,425 --> 01:08:24,591
There are so many qualities of Shri Ganesha,

528
01:08:24,967 --> 01:08:27,050
which can be described.

529
01:08:27,466 --> 01:08:34,466
He is the one who gives us the joy of eating.

530
01:08:37,092 --> 01:08:43,633
If you eat some food, you may like it, you may not like it

531
01:08:44,092 --> 01:08:46,424
but He is the one who will tell you

532
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:50,300
this is made by Sahaja yogis, made by your Mother.

533
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:54,925
That means He gives you the taste of love

534
01:08:55,466 --> 01:08:58,466
in the food that is cooked for you.

535
01:08:59,008 --> 01:09:02,716
Because He is love.

536
01:09:03,883 --> 01:09:09,883
He gives you the ideas how to express your love.

537
01:09:11,384 --> 01:09:14,008
Once they asked Me to sing a song.

538
01:09:14,424 --> 01:09:16,424
I used to sing very well once upon a time

539
01:09:16,883 --> 01:09:18,675
but then after lecturing so many times,

540
01:09:19,217 --> 01:09:21,134
you see I think I lost My voice.

541
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:23,758
I couldn’t sing well, I thought so.

542
01:09:24,259 --> 01:09:27,050
One day they asked Me to sing a song

543
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:32,758
and I thought of some song and sang to them.

544
01:09:33,508 --> 01:09:38,633
And after a year or so in a program they said,

545
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:41,175
“Mother we want to sing You a song.”

546
01:09:41,550 --> 01:09:44,716
This was a song unknown to everyone,

547
01:09:45,342 --> 01:09:47,384
I don’t know from where they got it,

548
01:09:47,883 --> 01:09:49,550
from where they made the tune.

549
01:09:49,967 --> 01:09:53,425
They started singing the same song.

550
01:09:53,925 --> 01:09:58,675
And such joy, I mean, it all became waves of tears

551
01:09:59,092 --> 01:10:02,758
in My eyes. I couldn’t control My joy.

552
01:10:03,259 --> 01:10:08,134
Now all this feeling of joy

553
01:10:08,925 --> 01:10:14,342
comes from the devices produced by Shri Ganesha.

554
01:10:14,758 --> 01:10:21,050
He is busy creating relationships, beautiful.

555
01:10:21,425 --> 01:10:26,092
How? In a birthday, a child’s birthday, what do we say?

556
01:10:26,466 --> 01:10:29,175
“All right, so tomorrow morning

557
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:33,716
there’s a bird is going to drop a present for you.”

558
01:10:34,716 --> 01:10:37,466
And then the child gets up and sees there’s no bird.

559
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:40,008
It’s only Ganesha who has given the idea.

560
01:10:40,508 --> 01:10:45,217
We can say He is a Santa Claus.

561
01:10:45,925 --> 01:10:49,424
He gives you ways and methods and He tells you

562
01:10:49,925 --> 01:10:55,300
how to delicately build up relationships, pure relationships.

563
01:11:02,466 --> 01:11:07,259
How you hide, how you wrap a little present,

564
01:11:07,591 --> 01:11:14,092
just put it there and a person who has to take it, sees it,

565
01:11:14,716 --> 01:11:18,716
“Oh God.” And then you see that flowers

566
01:11:19,217 --> 01:11:22,508
which you suddenly bring out, you put them,

567
01:11:22,967 --> 01:11:28,800
is all Shri Ganesha’s efforts, His ways, His suggestions.

568
01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:35,883
Among the creation, flowers are expressing

569
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:39,716
Shri Ganesha’s essence.

570
01:11:40,134 --> 01:11:41,591
And the essence of Shri Ganesha

571
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:49,175
comes from the Mother Earth’s essence, is the fragrance.

572
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:55,758
So a person who is endowed

573
01:11:56,424 --> 01:12:00,424
with Shri Ganesha’s blessings has fragrance,

574
01:12:00,883 --> 01:12:06,425
sometimes chandan, sometime roses,

575
01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:12,925
sometimes these gardenia.

576
01:12:13,591 --> 01:12:17,259
You just don’t know from where the fragrance is coming.

577
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:23,259
The fragrance is coming from Shri Ganesh

578
01:12:24,425 --> 01:12:30,175
and that is what is the magnet within you.

579
01:12:31,550 --> 01:12:37,883
Such a person is fragrant, absolutely fragrant all the time.

580
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:47,508
Shri Ganesha emits all kinds of fragrance from such a person.

581
01:12:52,716 --> 01:12:59,591
And that you can only feel when your Shri Ganesha is all right.

582
01:13:03,175 --> 01:13:08,384
There’s no end to the description of this great Deity within you.

583
01:13:08,758 --> 01:13:12,175
He’s just settled down there, He’s all the time there,

584
01:13:12,633 --> 01:13:17,217
waiting to be cleansed out, for Him to raise His head,

585
01:13:17,675 --> 01:13:20,925
like a lotus in the mud.

586
01:13:21,424 --> 01:13:24,092
You just help it out by respecting it

587
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:27,758
and He’ll be there, fragrant within you.

588
01:13:28,259 --> 01:13:31,800
So important for this country

589
01:13:32,342 --> 01:13:40,842
where we have raised our head without surrendering

590
01:13:41,424 --> 01:13:50,050
it to the Virata, to the collectivity, to Shri Krishna.

591
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:53,758
We have raised our head,

592
01:13:54,259 --> 01:13:58,591
with Shri Ganesha we bow down our head,

593
01:13:59,092 --> 01:14:04,134
for all the bounties that God has bestowed upon us.

594
01:14:04,633 --> 01:14:06,217
All arrogance will disappear at the

595
01:14:06,716 --> 01:14:09,008
Lotus Feet of Shri Ganesha.

596
01:14:09,217 --> 01:14:11,425
He’ll give us wisdom.

597
01:14:11,925 --> 01:14:14,092
He’ll give us sense to understand.

598
01:14:14,424 --> 01:14:17,050
He’ll give us power to overcome our arrogance

599
01:14:17,425 --> 01:14:18,842
that is within us.

600
01:14:19,633 --> 01:14:24,050
He’s the one who is the giver of knowledge.

601
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:26,675
He’s the one who is give us light.

602
01:14:27,175 --> 01:14:29,550
Many people in India also worship Shri Ganesha,

603
01:14:30,008 --> 01:14:33,134
go on “Shri Ganesha, Shri Ganesha, Shri Ganesha,

604
01:14:33,633 --> 01:14:39,466
and do all kinds of funny things.

605
01:14:40,092 --> 01:14:44,550
That’s like cheating yourself unnecessarily.

606
01:14:45,134 --> 01:14:49,217
It’s so simple to establish Shri Ganesha within you.

607
01:14:49,675 --> 01:14:56,550
But understand that it is vital

608
01:14:57,217 --> 01:15:01,092
that you people who are Sahaja yogis

609
01:15:01,633 --> 01:15:05,008
should establish Shri Ganesha,

610
01:15:05,550 --> 01:15:08,633
which is a silent power within you, doesn’t talk.

611
01:15:09,175 --> 01:15:13,466
It’s a silent power, which acts.

612
01:15:14,134 --> 01:15:18,466
Just a power that’s dynamic

613
01:15:19,050 --> 01:15:25,550
without any noise, without any show.

614
01:15:26,842 --> 01:15:31,424
And that is what I would say that today

615
01:15:31,842 --> 01:15:37,883
when I have said all these things from My heart,

616
01:15:38,425 --> 01:15:43,842
you the Sahaja yogis will establish Shri Ganesha within you.

617
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:49,425
And from you, you will emit such powers

618
01:15:49,925 --> 01:15:54,050
that others will be able to establish

619
01:15:54,425 --> 01:15:57,758
their Shri Ganesha in this country.

620
01:15:58,424 --> 01:15:59,300
May God bless you.

621
01:18:23,925 --> 01:18:25,466
We’ll call her as Gauri.

622
01:18:25,967 --> 01:18:30,342
Today is Ganesha’s day so Gauri is the name.

623
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:23,716
Hello.

624
01:19:57,424 --> 01:20:00,967
Now on a Diwali day to worship Shri Ganesha

625
01:20:01,424 --> 01:20:04,342
and also Shri Lakshmi on that day,

626
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:08,675
so today as we are worshipping Shri Ganesha also,

627
01:20:09,134 --> 01:20:10,842
we have to worship Shri Lakshmi,

628
01:20:11,259 --> 01:20:13,883
so I’ll call her as Lakshmi today.

629
01:20:14,217 --> 01:20:18,425
All right? Thank you.

630
01:20:30,633 --> 01:20:38,050
Look at this little baby, doesn’t cry. You’re such a big girl.

631
01:20:54,925 --> 01:20:57,384
But see the little babies do not cry.

632
01:20:57,716 --> 01:20:59,591
You’re a big girl …why are you crying?

633
01:21:00,008 --> 01:21:02,633
And what are you wearing on your feet? Let Me see.

634
01:21:03,092 --> 01:21:06,259
Do they make a noise?

635
01:21:06,633 --> 01:21:07,384
No?

636
01:21:08,424 --> 01:21:09,925
So we can get you better ones.

637
01:21:10,217 --> 01:21:11,842
Let Me see how big your feet are.

638
01:21:12,259 --> 01:21:15,342
Let Me see. They’re very small, aren’t they.

639
01:21:15,716 --> 01:21:18,134
You are a big girl or a small girl?

640
01:21:18,550 --> 01:21:22,716
Small? No, no, she’s big, she can stand up, let's see?

641
01:21:23,134 --> 01:21:30,384
Let’s see. Hallo. Come along, come here.

642
01:21:38,425 --> 01:21:41,424
What’s the matter with her?

643
01:21:41,967 --> 01:21:46,342
She always like this?

644
01:21:47,134 --> 01:21:49,300
We’ll call her Siddhi. This is the power.

645
01:21:49,675 --> 01:21:51,675
Siddhi is a good name.

646
01:22:04,633 --> 01:22:08,300
All right. May God bless you.

647
01:22:08,424 --> 01:22:10,217
She’ll be all right.

648
01:22:35,466 --> 01:22:39,883
Look at that. Take a picture.

649
01:22:40,134 --> 01:22:44,425
May God bless you. May God bless you.

650
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:48,008
Get up now. All right.

651
01:22:48,424 --> 01:22:51,800
You must get up. Come here. Come here. Aah.

652
01:22:52,175 --> 01:22:53,842
So now we’ll call him as Vinayaka.

653
01:22:54,175 --> 01:22:59,300
That’s the name of Shri Ganesha, Vinayaka.

654
01:23:08,508 --> 01:23:10,758
Who else is there?

655
01:23:15,758 --> 01:23:17,092
Come along.

656
01:23:40,842 --> 01:23:45,967
Hello. We’ll call him Ganapati.

657
01:24:18,050 --> 01:24:20,550
May God bless you.

658
01:24:21,424 --> 01:24:28,217
Come here. We’ll call them as Gauri and Ganesha.

659
01:24:32,508 --> 01:24:36,466
Gauri and Ganesha.

660
01:24:37,217 --> 01:24:38,758
Can you come?

661
01:25:00,217 --> 01:25:05,925
Ganesha’s another name is Omkara. We’ll call him Omkara.

662
01:25:08,050 --> 01:25:11,300
May God bless you.

663
01:25:13,175 --> 01:25:17,134
Come here. Good. You are Omkara now. All right?

664
01:25:17,466 --> 01:25:21,800
Good name, Omkara.

665
01:25:56,842 --> 01:25:58,967
So now...

666
01:26:02,384 --> 01:26:09,508
Ramma. Ramma is name of the Devi, name of Parvati.

667
01:26:17,466 --> 01:26:21,550
Is the name of the Mother of Ganesha, Ramma.

668
01:26:22,008 --> 01:26:31,842
Ramma is the one that plays in the heart.

669
01:26:38,050 --> 01:26:39,842
Janaki. Janaki.

01:27:44,716 --> 01:27:47,508
Sharmila, Sharmadayini, Sharmila, Sharmadayani

Giver of bliss. Giver of bliss.
