00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.320
Thank you very much

00:04:28.066 --> 00:04:31.026
Somebody will translate Me or...

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.240
The song is written by a relation of ours.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:52.760
He was a convert to Christianity, but a realized soul, and

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.840
he could never cope with the system of conversion

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.960
and also the way the Hindus were treated among themselves,

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.040
with the caste system, and all that,

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.880
and he has written very good,

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.120
some of the very good hymns, I should say,

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.400
this is one of the hymns.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.840
The song is something

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.880
I really always used to sing in my childhood very much,

00:05:48.240 --> 00:06:02.320
and the theme of the song is like this:

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:13.400
"The one who has got God,

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.280
or the one who has owned the God,

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.200
why should he have any fear?

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.880
The one

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:47.080
who moves about or the one who goes about..."

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.160
I don't know what is the English word for

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.920
'extensive travelling'.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.600
The one who moves about extensively,

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:05.440
for the sake of God and for doing good to others,

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.320
but he does not belong to this world,

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:22.720
such a person has no fear.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.320
He stands above...

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.720
-the language, Marathi language you see, is a very,

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:40.120
very intense language, I should say, and it touches many corners

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.880
when you say one word to it. It's like this one is:

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.760
"Adhi Vyadhi Varana Varati Payi Asha Purusha Chari."

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:57.560
It means: A person of this caliber is standing above.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:03.200
His foot is above the sickness,

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.720
the mental problems,

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.360
and the death itself.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.840
But when you say that

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.040
such a person has the foot on top of this, means also,

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:20.560
you see, it's meaning is, that with the effect of his foot,

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.720
it can get over it.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.640
It's a double language you see.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.320
Like such a person has his foot on top of all these three things,

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:37.240
is the sickness, the mental problems, and the death.

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.960
The foot is on top of that.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.120
It means that such a person is above this.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.960
Thus, if you have somebody of this caliber

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.160
and the foot touches the sick,

00:08:52.320 --> 00:09:00.920
or the mentally disturbed people,

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.720
or the dead,

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:10.480
such a person can raise them higher,

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.040
can take them out of it.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.880
It has a double meaning.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.920
So the whole theme works out this way:

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.600
that the person who belongs to God,

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.280
who owns the God,

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.480
should not have fear,

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.120
should not get frustrated.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.840
I needed it very much today.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.320
Because one side of course, is

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.160
the joy of seeing so many Sahaja Yogis, real Sahaja Yogis,

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.280
not artificial disciples or dramatists,

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.240
but real Sahaja Yogis of very high caliber,

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.480
and some of the people who stand on the periphery,

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.400
have been on periphery for such a long time,

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.800
that's, sometimes is dangerous for Me to see

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.120
they will be destroyed.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:23.920
At this time, you need a song like this

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.760
and in childhood whenever I felt really desperate,

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.760
I used to sing this song.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.240
It's a very touching song.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.240
All right?

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.160
But word by word I could not.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.120
I'm not in a, sort of a proper mood I think.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.200
So it's touched Me very much.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.640
This is Rutambhara  Pragnya.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:58.080
I wanted it very much today.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:38.240
So this morning I was telling you about this new awareness.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.560
Pragnya. 'Gnya' means the knowledge

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.520
and 'Pra' means the awakened knowledge.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.760
Which comes out of meditation,

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.960
sustenance of meditation,

00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:01.400
and then the Samadhi is the effect of that.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:09.600
It's a kind of a fruit ripening.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:17.160
When this ripens, then you get the taste,

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.400
the sweetness of character,

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:26.120
and then you start seeing around,

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:31.120
how the Nature, the Divine,

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.640
is sweetly playing with you.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.120
This state must be achieved.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.520
For every Sahaja Yogi, it is important

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.800
that they must achieve this state,

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:49.760
because unless and until you have minimum achieved this state,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.880
you'll be still in a dangerous zone,

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:59.800
which, as I told you, upsets Me very much.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:05.240
So everybody must decide to reach a state

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:15.960
where you every day see the blessings of God manifesting.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.880
That means you enter into the kingdom of God.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.080
This is the kingdom of God,

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:28.920
in which you are looked after, protected, guided,

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:36.760
and properly taken to the place of heavenly bliss.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.760
Through material manifestation,

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.360
through mental manifestation,

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.480
through financial manifestation,

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.720
through relationship manifestation,

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.480
through so many things,

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.800
and also the natural manifestation

00:13:53.960 --> 00:14:02.560
by which you see the sun, the moon, the stars, the heavens,

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:08.080
and all the five elements help you.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:14.280
This state, all of you must achieve.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:20.520
All of you. Again the word is 'all' of you should achieve.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:26.760
And then only the higher ascent works out.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:43.160
Now, "How to achieve this state?" is a common question.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.200
Now, the first thing as I told you today,

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.800
that you are extremely fortunate people,

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.480
compared to all the seekers of the world,

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:59.880
who have been, who will be, and who are.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.960
Because so many things are,

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:10.080
which were used by seekers to overcome,

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.160
you don't have to overcome.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:17.360
For example they used to meditate, say,

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.600
on some name of God,

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:28.360
and the attention would go on, say, repeating the name

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.960
of, praying to that God,

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.480
or thinking about that God and all that,

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.200
but the whole thing would be mechanical,

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:41.520
and always they would jump into some sort of a

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:46.880
low type of a siddhi, so-called, means they get possessed.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:54.480
Those people who start taking the name, say, of Rama,

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.680
you have seen so many of them,

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.520
they start jumping,

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:03.520
and they start behaving in a funny manner.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:08.960
So the attention instead of being, becoming concentrated,

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:17.160
would become extremely disturbed, very disturbed,

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:21.040
and a funny attention, wobbly-type.

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:25.920
And when they became wobbly,

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:30.680
and a kind of a left-sidedness came into them,

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:37.160
they would go on enjoying it,

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.600
just like a drunkard enjoys.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.080
Then such people would weep, cry,

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:45.560
enjoy their crying, trouble others by their crying,

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.800
and they would not have power to overcome that.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.880
So much they would be possessed.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.960
Then another kind who were, say, ambitious people,

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.080
like we have many scientists, and these kind of people,

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:07.280
ambitious people, they would get auto-hypnotized.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.600
Thinking no end of themselves,

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:13.480
behaving in the most stupid manner

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.520
and also they would get possessed,

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.960
and you can see people like Hitler, and all sorts.

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.920
So many of these people today,

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:26.480
who are ruling the world, supposed to be

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.320
in democracy or, say, communism, or anyway.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:38.240
Most of them are actually the despots

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:46.640
and that's why the chaos today.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:51.680
And a theme like nationalistic-spirit

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:56.120
or something like that they would develop,

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.280
and try to take the advantage

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:03.760
of people's right-sidedness and involve them into wars,

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:07.880
and all sorts of destructive things.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:11.200
This kind of attention

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:15.480
is possible for people who think they are very great,

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.280
say, Hindus, Christians, mostly they are warring people.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.680
Muslims... Nowadays the Muslims are all warring, imagine,

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:27.000
among themselves, that's the best part of it.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.920
And the Christians are all warring among themselves.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.880
And the Hindus are all warring among themselves.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.680
Like there are only two nations

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.960
where there is Hindu majority, so called, is

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.040
one is Nepal, and one is India,

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.960
and all the time they are quarrelling.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.200
There's not one day passes

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.560
without hearing some news of some sort of a quarrel,

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.240
because Hindus won't use the swords,

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:56.120
but a very cold-blooded quarrel is on.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.640
So this is the situation.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.360
In the name of God, again I say,

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:06.880
because they started on a very different level,

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.800
and their attention goes left or right,

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.600
and they develop those siddhis.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.360
So what have we to do?

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.800
First of all, by God's grace, as I told you,

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.600
you all are realized people

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:28.640
so your ascent is made in the center,

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.080
which is a very, very, difficult thing,

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.920
absolutely difficult, no doubt.

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:39.200
But you should learn to keep in the center.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.880
But how to keep the attention in the center

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.080
is the problem for many people

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:51.560
who are still not above themselves.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:59.320
Now when you meditate,

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:07.480
try to meditate in a sustained way, first of all sustain it.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.320
Then you find

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.880
that you are getting into the state

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:18.240
of Samadhi, means at a state

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.960
where you start feeling the joy

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:25.240
and the bliss of God's blessings,

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:29.480
and then you start saying "O God, what a blessing,

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:34.040
what a blessing, and what a blessing".

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:38.360
Once you have reached that state

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:45.960
then you have to realize "Who am I".

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.720
Who are you?

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.080
What are you?

00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:00.000
You are the Spirit.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:08.280
After establishing your sustained attention on the Spirit

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.800
you'll develop a state where you'll be

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:18.840
in a complete state of witnessing with joy.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:23.280
Now those, say, who are here,

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.960
can judge themselves very simply in a way.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:32.800
Those who tried to have the best rooms,

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.160
they must have booked ten days ahead of time

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:40.280
then must have done this, that, to get a good room.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:44.480
Those who want to have the best food,

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:49.000
or the best time, tried to have a position, in the mind.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.960
Face yourself honestly.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:55.080
Sahaja Yoga is an honest endeavor.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:59.800
The best privacy for themselves.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.760
You all should face yourself.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.960
Then the husband/wife, they want the privacy to themselves.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:12.120
This is not the time for husband/wife to be gathered

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:17.480
or for you to talk loudly and move about and have fun.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.680
No, this is meditative time you have come for.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.200
Is very short time according to Me,

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:28.080
because people spend thousands and thousands of days

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.160
to establish their meditative mood.

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.480
But in this speedy life

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.560
you have to have intensity to establish.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.240
So get into meditative mood. Some people feel

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.080
that they have come for a proper

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.600
holiday making and there's no sea here,

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.840
so how will they have a swim -- sort of temperament.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.560
Those who are not so badly off,

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.600
would be asking for more comfort,

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:56.360
"I couldn't get food, I should have this,

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.640
the best to be given to my child,

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:03.360
or to my husband, or to my wife." "My."

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:09.520
It doesn't matter for one day or night you sleep,

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:13.200
boys together and ladies together.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.240
If there are children, all right,

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:21.720
but there's no need, for husband/wife to sleep together

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:26.560
in this time when you are meditating all in one room, at all.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:31.360
You have come for a very special purpose here.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:38.880
You have paid for it!

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.600
So be meditative.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:46.480
What I find, everybody was talking loudly.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.480
I didn't find them in that meditative mood.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.600
Everybody was thinking they are enjoying here,

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.400
very much nice, good, you see.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:02.320
All these ideas are old ideas.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:07.200
The silence must be established within and without.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.000
I must say, for this, of course Indians are,

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:14.200
they know all that so I would not say Indian qualities,

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:17.200
but Australia.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:22.120
Australia, I stayed there in all these Ashrams.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.560
In Sydney we had fifty to sixty people living there

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:28.680
every day. I never heard a voice

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:32.320
or even the movement of the foot till I was there,

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.920
when I was there. And I was not there for a day or so,

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.840
I was there for about ten, fifteen days.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.320
Not even the movement and the children crying, nothing,

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.880
I never heard a sound.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:57.200
This was one of the ways you can control your attention,

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:06.520
that in My presence, what do you speak?

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.280
What do you say?

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.440
You must know the protocol part of it.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.320
Whom are you talking?

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.040
You can't make fun, you can't joke.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.280
I can joke.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:22.080
You can sometimes smile, all right, or laugh sometimes,

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:26.560
but it has to be done with a weight.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.680
Whom are you talking to. The reason is,

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.400
I'm talking to you all this,

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.960
because it's only all this rapport,

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.320
all this behavior is going to help you.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.880
I'm not going to be helped.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.400
I'm not going to be saved,

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:48.080
I'm not going to get My realization.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:52.920
It is you who have to gain something out of Me.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:58.600
So try to settle your attention with that.

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:04.760
I've seen people who stay with Me sometimes.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:10.040
Sometimes I deliberately call them to see what's the problem is.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:14.000
Some of them who stay with Me, I find,

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.960
become subtler and subtler and subtler and deeper.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.440
And some of them start taking advantage,

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:28.160
taking liberties, then taking a kind of a course of life

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.640
which is so mundane and so stupid

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:35.640
that I can't understand.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:43.800
So this awareness should be within your heart,

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:48.040
that the time is very important.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:53.760
You have come here at a very, very important time.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.040
And that when you are with Me,

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.720
is the most important time, of that important time.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:03.920
Historically this is the most important time,

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.960
and take full advantage in the real sense of the word.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:12.680
Some people think if they can get some money out of Me

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:16.480
then it's a big advantage. All right, you can take it.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:20.280
Some people think if they can take some of My time,

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:24.960
they are at a very great advantage. All right you can, have it.

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:28.360
Or some people think if they can take advantage of Me,

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.720
sort of feeling ego-pampered or something-

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:34.200
"I m a great lord" and some sort of a thing, you know

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.240
All right!

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:41.240
But those who are wise take the best advantage

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:45.840
and the best advantage is the growth within.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.360
So the first awareness has to be

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.000
that you are such lucky people

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:55.280
that before you stands someone

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.920
who has the control over all the centers,

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:05.400
over all the powers or, say, who is all-powerful.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.120
How much advantage you have taken of that

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:14.400
is the important thing.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:18.560
Now where I stay there are two places you can say,

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.440
in England, and in India, mostly,

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:25.600
and the contrast I feel English and Indian thing,

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:31.120
in India the more I have stayed, they become more protocolish

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:38.560
because they have old traditional training.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:42.640
But in England I find, people start taking advantage,

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:45.760
making fun, joking.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.680
You cannot!

00:28:53.720 --> 00:29:00.440
You see, it is different to please,

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:04.360
but it is different to be frivolous

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:08.160
and shallow with somebody so intense.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.880
For example if there's a tin-board

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.640
and you take it under the Niagara fall,

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.880
what will happen to the tin-board?

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:25.680
It won't be able to bear even the slightest shower of that.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:34.520
So despite Rutambhara Pragnya, like the sun today,

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.920
You must have been upset yesterday, thinking that,

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.040
"Now we have come here, we have to live in the tents,

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.840
and the water is raining",

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.440
I know many of you must have been.

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:49.160
But the one who has achieved that state would not be:

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.840
"What is there? If I've to live doesn't matter.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.240
I'm here for a special purpose.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:00.440
As long as I achieve that purpose nothing matters to me.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.680
What discomfort, what all these things happen to me,

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:06.600
I have to achieve that purpose."

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:11.480
Some of you people cannot see Me so closely,

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:16.120
some of you are still not capable, doesn't matter.

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:19.120
What is most important is:

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:26.120
"I should achieve that state, I have come here for that.

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:30.560
Not for fun, not for food, not for comfort.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:34.920
Not for anything, but for achieving a special state

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.960
where I become the Guru.

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:40.880
What is my preparation for that?"

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:47.600
We have to be extremely careful,

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:55.600
because the attention of the Divine

00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:01.040
is not raising you directly.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.600
It is a balance.

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:07.400
You are all the time in a balance, remember that,

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:10.960
and you have to be extremely careful

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:15.360
how far you go with that balance.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:20.680
So now, how do you develop?

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.840
It's all right, don't worry, about the sun,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.120
I like it.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:31.080
I only called him this morning.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:43.960
So how do you manage this attention?

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:50.320
Now let us see what are the states of attentions are.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:55.760
Either your attention would be a cunning attention.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:59.720
Anything you see, you see from a cunning angle.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:04.680
Many people develop that in an ego-oriented society.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.920
And moreover if you are sort of possessed by cunning bhoots,

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:12.160
then God save you and save others.

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.560
Like the cunning attention would be that,

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.600
anything you see, you start thinking

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.880
"What advantage I can take out of this.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.080
How much money I can save", you see.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.720
It's very, very quick.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:27.440
"It would be cheaper this way."

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:32.560
"If I go by this way I'll save some time",

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.800
you see, "save pounds", "save time",

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:40.720
save everything and save your own Self.

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.360
So just to save you are going on.

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:47.920
The attention becomes cunning when you try to save money.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:51.360
Save here. Save there.

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:56.760
With your own calculations.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:01.720
But if you try to save the money spontaneously,

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.280
actually there is nothing to be tried,

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:07.600
just it happens that you save.

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:11.240
But the cunning attention tries all the time

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.600
to be smart about things.

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:22.920
It argues, it gives explanations,

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.680
"Is it better....?" These days

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.640
it's such a cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap thing

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.840
that you go mad really.

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.400
Like I had a ticket to go to America.

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:32.600
I said, "Don't give Me an expensive ticket, first class, or ....

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:35.520
I'll go by a cheap ticket".

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:40.480
So they gave Me a ticket, of such a kind

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.920
that, I would never have come back to London

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.320
at least for a year,

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.880
and I would have lost in that American English, I tell you,

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.400
somewhere.

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.640
So it's so much [they ?] had worked out, you know,

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.200
this into that, into that.

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:59.960
That kind of a horrible attention is useless.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:03.320
Leave it, forget it.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:07.800
With that saving also I've not seen anybody becoming rich.

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:16.160
Like you want, I want to go and buy some paint.

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.880
So we buy some paint.

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:23.520
Then they think, "All right, if you bring it back,

00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:25.000
then how can we return it,

00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:28.400
what should we do, this, that." Nonsense!

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.640
All the time the mind is on that level.

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.920
I'll give you an example, the other day

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:38.400
we got some paint to paint the glass.

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.880
See the subtle part of it,

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:42.520
you see, in the gross there is a subtler indication,

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:45.080
and the paint was brought.

00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:48.360
And then, it was worth nothing, eighty p (pence) or something.

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.200
All right, I mean I can afford it,

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.440
so that's why I bought.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.960
If you can't afford don't buy!

00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:58.560
So they said, "Now we should return" I said,

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.600
"But why? Now it's come out, now go and return.

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.720
You spend so much petrol going there.

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.960
If you want to calculate also it's stupid,

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:07.880
and the time you'll be wasting."

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:12.680
"No but Mother, you see, ultimately we save two p!"

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.160
I said, "All right,

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.400
now I'll save a lot of money, and I'll show you how."

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:20.760
I took that paint and painted many things

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:24.320
which looked like glass, or which was stone-like,

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:29.200
and the whole thing looked so beautiful.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:35.520
So the mind that is destructive is only calculating.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.880
If you have such a mind

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.440
know yourself that you have to get rid of

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:43.160
that kind of a calculation.

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.480
Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, things

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:49.120
you should just give up. Keep in the centre.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:52.080
You should not be, of course, over-indulgent.

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:54.920
But you should not be also going for, all the time,

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:56.080
for this kind of a calculation,

00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:00.240
because you are wasting your important awakened attention

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.960
which very few people have in this world.

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.960
Must know that you are realized souls,

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:09.400
you are not ordinary mundane type of people.

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.720
You are special people and you are not to waste

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:15.400
your attention in useless calculating money, 'p',

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:19.080
and this and that.

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:24.760
Let's go ahead. What happens, let's see.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:31.160
I never calculate you know that, but I live very cheaply,

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:34.840
and you can also do that.

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.120
This attention, cunning attention,

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:40.560
is also a very fussy attention.

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:44.200
Here it starts saving money

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:49.960
and then, there it is in the evening it must drink.

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:54.280
So all the saving of p, p, p, p, goes into

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:57.120
the gutters of drinking.

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:03.080
Just sin. The sum total of such a personality is what?

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:09.400
So this mentality has to be controlled.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:12.520
Specially for ego-oriented people are extremely calculating

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:16.320
most surprising it is.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:21.440
But the people like Indians who are not calculating

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:26.120
are not so rich.

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:31.800
They are very generous, they always have money for Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:37.080
I have had never a problem of money with them, never,

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.960
because they are not so calculating.

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:45.600
To them, to do for others, not for yourself, but for others.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:46.880
To spend for others.

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.440
If they have to come to your house:

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.920
"All right, open your heart. Now this is the time to spend."

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:55.520
Not for drinking and self-indulgence,

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:59.080
but for the indulgence of doing for others.

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:01.720
That's their practice and tradition.

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.960
So in this respect, you have to take to that tradition:

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:06.680
"Oh they have come. Let's spend now.

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:10.440
What can we do?"

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.920
This is the main thing one should understand,

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:17.640
those who are mostly self-indulgent

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:22.240
are extremely miserly people.

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:28.680
So the attention which is cunning,

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.600
is the worse attention, because you see,

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:34.000
cunningness also cheats yourself. It is cunning with you,

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.360
and you think, "Oh I've been smart enough, you see,

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.960
I've saved two p".

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:42.920
But you have lost your soul.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:47.080
You are no more a Sahaja Yogi.

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:58.200
I'll give you an example.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.680
I told somebody that,

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:05.240
"Keep the van down there, go by train,

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:09.840
this van seems to be a horrible van."

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.240
And there was a lot of a, you see, explanation,

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:15.080
with both the fingers going on like this to Me, you see,

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:19.080
and I got so fed up with the bomb shells coming on Me

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:21.360
that I said, to go ahead.

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:24.320
And the thing fell,

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:29.840
and the thing got spoilt or whatever it is,

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:31.840
is out of order now.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.600
So they had to do what I was telling them.

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.480
Without the bomb shell, if they had listened to Me

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:39.200
it would have been all right.

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:46.840
So your attention should not be on saving material things

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.160
and worldly things and all that,

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:55.920
but attention itself must be saved.

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:00.080
Ask a question, "Where is my attention?".

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.800
I've seen in the programs

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.200
some people are concentratedly listening to me,

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.280
but some people cannot.

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:09.400
Some are concentrated for a short while,

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:14.680
and some get disinterested after some time.

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:18.840
Some are looking here. Some are looking there.

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:23.560
So how much attention you have saved is the only concern

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:26.120
of a Sahaja Yogi. Forget about others,

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:29.360
they are all garbage cleaners, you see.

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:32.720
Forget about others who are not seeking,

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:35.600
who are not of your quality, but you are a quality.

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:39.400
Now what do you have to save?

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:42.960
For example somebody is a king.

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.080
He doesn't bother of two p being saved.

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:48.520
I don't know baba, these days, I can't say definitely!

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:51.720
They must be also doing that kind of a thing, you know, but

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:55.920
what is he bothered to save his grace, to dignity.

00:40:56.080 --> 00:41:00.360
But for a Sahaja Yogi the most important thing is,

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.640
you must save your attention.

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.600
It's called as Chitta Nirodha.

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:08.880
Nirodh -- is saving of your attention.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:13.200
"Where is it going, It's such a precious thing for me.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.920
Where is it running?"

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:18.360
Then how do you save your attention?

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:22.400
Is through concentration.

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:27.320
Concentrate. Try to concentrate.

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:30.840
Don't allow your attention to wobble.

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:37.200
Gradually you will develop concentration.

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:43.040
You can watch My photograph, it's the best.

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:45.960
Concentrate, bring it in your heart,

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:49.440
let it be integrated in your heart.

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:52.040
You are lucky people,

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.640
you don't have to build up a photograph,

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:58.200
and then give it up because it is just a Avalambana,

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:01.160
means it's just a dependence,

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.600
and then you remove it.

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:07.120
It's a complete dependence for you

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:12.400
and a load for Me -- of complete joy.

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:17.800
So when you are concentrating in Sahaja Yoga,

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:21.920
absolutely fully in Sahaja Yoga,

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:27.560
then you are controlling, saving, your attention.

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:31.040
This is one type of people.

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:34.840
Then the another type of an attention, what we call,

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:44.200
are the people who are sort of take a very negative attitude.

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:47.760
The first are the positive, so called,

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:49.600
so called positive,

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:57.440
who are saving money, saving everything that is useless.

00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:05.400
Now the second type are the archbishops of all that is disaster,

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:08.840
misery, mishaps

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.120
This type of an attention.

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:13.680
If you read newspaper every morning

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:16.920
you will have an attention like that.

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:19.680
All the newspaper people have that kind of an attention,

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:21.640
to find where is the disaster.

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.880
I mean, in a sinister way,

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:26.400
they feel happy there's a disaster.

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.960
I've seen people, "Oh Mother, I came to the seminar

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:34.880
but the problem is, you see, there was no water."

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.880
The attention is in finding disasters

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:42.800
within and without.

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.960
"What happened?", "There's a disaster",

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:49.400
"What happened?" "I lost the pin".

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:57.120
Absurd, to have such stupid ideas.

00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:00.840
They will cry and weep and make everyone miserable,

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:03.080
"Oooh, I'm so miserable."

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:07.440
"What?", "My husband doesn't talk to me",

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.240
or "My child is not with me."

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:12.560
Such people are extremely self-indulgent

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:15.920
as far as their relationships are concerned.

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:17.880
They make everyone like that,

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:20.280
"Oh, the person didn't talk to me nicely

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.120
and he was this way and that way."

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:26.320
They feel hurt at the slightest touch

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:33.800
and by that they think they are saving their emotions

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:35.880
if not the material things.

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.560
Such people are very frightened people to talk to anyone,

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:41.640
and anybody says nice things also, they get a fright,

00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:44.840
like this, they'll frown.

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.360
The reason is they do not know what they have to save,

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:50.040
is not their emotions at all.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:53.400
There's no need to save your emotions, you are protected.

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.520
What does it matter if somebody says anything to you,

00:44:55.680 --> 00:45:00.160
you are above there, nobody can touch you!

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:05.760
You are wasting your attention all the time

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:10.920
by trying to save your emotions.

00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:16.800
There's nothing to be frightened of anyone,

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:19.440
because somebody is going to say something, harsh word,

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:21.160
that's why you don't want to do something.

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:25.920
Such compromising people, so called,

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:27.920
have not understood Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:30.400
There is no compromise in Sahaja Yoga at all.

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:36.480
It is just like a diamond.

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:39.360
Diamond will remain a diamond whatever you do,

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:42.960
it's for ever and ever,

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:47.200
it's like that.

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:51.160
So one has to understand that the attention should not be allowed

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:54.080
to drift into this kind of an indulgence

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.320
which is of a drunkard,

00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:59.880
that, they are the most miserable people, the drunkards are

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:06.840
Just imagine. They'll be always crying, weeping,

00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:12.320
and people would think they are very miserable.

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:16.000
So what you have to save at that time is your attention

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:17.880
from such indulgences

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:22.120
into useless expression of your fear

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:26.160
about your emotions.

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:29.480
See now, today they sang the song.

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.960
The song did fill Me.

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:36.120
Completely brought out some of the expressions

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:40.480
which would not spontaneously come out at this time.

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:45.560
But the greatest thing it has done is to remind Me

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:53.040
that, "You are God. You are not to get frustrated,

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:58.280
You have to look after all of them,

00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:00.160
and You are powerful.

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:06.440
How dare to suspect yourself or feel frustrated.

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:10.520
That thing which is so much reflecting,

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:14.080
like a mirror, I see My mirror

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:17.880
In the same way you should also

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:24.600
have your emotional understanding

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:26.400
and the emotion should be a mirror,

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:28.480
you should see yourself in your emotions,

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:33.720
how you behave, how you treat, how you talk

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:41.760
So such people should always keep a mirror

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:46.280
and feel elevated.

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:49.760
You are a Sahaja Yogi

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:55.160
and the mirror, in the reflection, you should see Me and not yourself.

00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:59.880
Sometimes I've an eye that really frustrated with Sahaja Yogis,

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:04.920
very much. Then I just stand before the mirror

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:08.320
and I say, "Now, come along.

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:11.120
You are the one who has all the powers,

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:13.160
who has all the chakras awakened.

00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:17.720
None of the Advents had this.

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:20.120
You are the one who has created this world

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:24.680
and You are the one who has to save it. So now, get up."

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:32.200
Not to lose courage,

00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:33.960
not to worry.

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.560
Only in the emotional things I sometimes

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:39.720
feel that now I'll have to give up some of them, completely.

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:43.400
They are My children, as a Mother, not as a Guru.

00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:45.080
For a Guru they don't have problem.

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:50.120
And then the stirring up comes in, within Myself that,

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:54.800
"No, even if I have to give up, doesn't matter, I have to raise,

00:48:54.960 --> 00:49:01.560
absolutely", and with that power it works.

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:04.320
So the reflection should be of Me,

00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:06.880
of something that is ideal before you,

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:11.480
the one that gives you energy, like this song

00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:15.600
and not the reflection of a miserable person.

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:20.400
Christ who's standing before you

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:27.800
as in the Sistine Chapel and not some miserable skeleton

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:30.800
which is even worse than you.

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:33.720
So create those images of your Mother

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:37.880
which you should see in your emotions and rise.

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:43.120
This is the second type of attention you have to control.

00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:50.640
The third one is a very horrid idiotic one.

00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:54.440
The idiotic one comes from the second type,

00:49:54.600 --> 00:50:00.640
where the person is emotionally indulgent.

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.160
That is the "A" of the third.

00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:06.640
And the "B" of the third comes from the first type,

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:10.600
which is stupid. So we have two types of people,

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:15.720
one idiotic and another are stupid.

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:20.600
But in Indian language there's only one word,

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:23.200
specially in Marathi -- is murkha.

00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:26.120
For them both categories are the same,

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:30.240
as if the circle meets at the same point.

00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:37.040
I mean English language in some ways is good

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:41.400
at least it differentiates between the murkhas,

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:44.680
like they can be stupid or they can be idiotic, you see.

00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:47.200
Because of psyche being so confused here,

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:51.680
that psychologists have brought out. Some are schizophrenic,

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:59.560
some are idiots, some are stupid, some are donkeys.

00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:08.240
So this, the third type is the worst, is most frustrating for Me.

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:10.360
They'll stick onto Me like leeches,

00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:12.760
they'll be saying stupid things all the time.

00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:15.800
Just can't bear an idiot, isn't it?

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:19.600
They can bore a person. I mean all sorts of this put together

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:21.160
is called as murkha.

00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:24.960
So I don't want to analyze it, it's a bit too much.

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:29.760
So that kind of an attention you have, then you better keep quiet.

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:36.680
Don't talk. Just listen to others what they talk, what they say.

00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:40.280
There are some people who will just go on talking, talking, talking,

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:45.000
irrelevantly, uselessly, wasting their energy,

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:48.360
and such people are always friends of the cunning.

00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:50.960
The cunning and such people go hand in hand,

00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:54.440
because the cunning wants to befool someone,

00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:56.960
and the fool wants to be befooled.

00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:59.240
Like a king will have a jester,

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:03.200
it's like that you see, these combinations work out.

00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:08.480
So for such people the best thing is to keep quiet.

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:11.120
Preserve all their attention,

00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:15.640
all their energies just for cleansing.

00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:20.880
All this idiocity will pass away very soon

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:24.480
if you try to preserve yourself. Don't talk,

00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:28.840
don't say things which are stupid,

00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:35.440
which are idiotic, just keep quiet, and watch others.

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:39.240
Sometimes such people can become very great vehicle

00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:40.880
of God's power,

00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:47.880
but if they do not take to stupidity and idiocy.

00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:53.200
This is the type of people, three types I would say,

00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:58.920
but the fourth type are the people who lead a life of concentration.

00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:01.440
I mean a person who is working very hard,

00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:06.440
say, in the office, is a very remarkably successful person,

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:09.280
and this and that, and that, and that, and that,

00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:11.640
is also very concentrated.

00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:14.440
Somebody who works very well, anywhere,

00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:17.960
with a concentrated mind, is concentrated.

00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:22.880
A housewife who looks after her husband and children is very concentrated,

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:26.080
and a husband who looks after his family

00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:28.440
and his things in a very concentrated way.

00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:31.240
They know how to paint well, they know how to do things,

00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:35.160
and their hands are deft, and they know everything.

00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:42.040
But such people can have a very immobile attention,

00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:45.240
very immobile, like plastic,

00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:49.640
or you can call it, like rubber.

00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:52.520
At the most, to improve on it, we can say,

00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:55.240
like some of the things I have seen which you use

00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:58.440
for damp-proofing, you see,

00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:04.080
you just apply it, after some time it's just parched, into it.

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:06.560
They just can't get out of it.

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:09.320
They just can't. They can't enjoy anything.

00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:12.680
Unless and until you show them a file you can't talk to them.

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:14.560
You see, if you have to talk to such a person,

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:18.080
better take a file before you,

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:21.880
and before starting you put the file before you.

00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:23.880
If it is on the file only, they will see,

00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:27.960
but if you talk, they say, "Make a file."

00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:31.560
Very parched, and they cannot enjoy life.

00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:34.120
There's no mobility, they cannot be creative.

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:38.880
They can be creative only as far as their style is concerned,

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:44.120
but not the creative of the joy.

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:46.960
So that kind of concentration is there,

00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:49.000
concentrated effort people put in.

00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:51.720
Like there are people who are fanatics.

00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:54.400
They are very concentrated in their effort, extremely.

00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:56.960
That's how all these religions have spread, like Christianity,

00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:59.040
Islam, Hinduism and all that,

00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:02.240
because they had a concentrated effort of fanaticism

00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:05.240
concentrated effort.

00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:07.200
If you read the letters of Paul in the Bible,

00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:09.280
you will see the concentration of it:

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:12.800
"You go there and you go there and establish a church and do this"

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:17.320
and "What you have done?". Very organized, very systematic,

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:25.400
absolutely moving like a belt on a machine.

00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:31.960
And they all the time have that after effects of that movement.

00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:35.960
Charlie Chaplin has shown in his picture "Modern Times".

00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.760
I used to enjoy that very much,

00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:41.040
that he used to tie up a belt, you see, standing

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:43.880
for about an hour, and then

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.200
after some time when he was released of the job,

00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:50.280
he used to go on like that.

00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:53.040
That kind of an attention,

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:56.400
that is concentrated, means stuck onto something.

00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:59.800
It's not that, it's not penetrating.

00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:02.760
Because if your attention doesn't become, by concentration,

00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:06.280
subtler and subtler, then it is not that

00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:09.880
but it is getting stuck, and the stuck attention

00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:11.400
is of no use for Sahaja Yoga.

00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:15.680
Such people, I do not know, will never be saved perhaps.

00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:18.440
So called successful.

00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:22.280
They'll go with all their badges, everything,

00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:25.440
and God will say, "Go back gentlemen,

00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:29.680
you are not yet been passed through the customs."

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:33.720
There is another organization,

00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:38.640
which works much faster, much smarter way,

00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:43.720
and a very specially efficient thing.

00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:50.040
So these people will be just 'stuck' people.

00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:59.360
Now there are fourth type of people which are concentrated.

00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:04.040
They are intense, deep.

00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:07.400
They penetrate

00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:09.160
because they are living minds.

00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:11.880
Theirs are not dead, parched minds, they have living mind,

00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:14.120
they penetrate.

00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:16.960
I watch sometimes, I ask some people

00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:19.120
what do you think of a particular person?

00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:22.720
Immediately I know, what they talk.

00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:25.360
If they just talk in a mundane way,

00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:29.280
"He is a fine person, he is a bad person, this thing, that thing",

00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:33.680
then I know what it is. Very superficial, shallow.

00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:39.520
But a person who sees the possibilities and the potentialities of

00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:43.200
it's awakening, and the problems a person is facing,

00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:46.920
then I know that he is the one who has that concentration

00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:49.480
into the subject.

00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:53.400
And the subject of Sahaja Yoga requires the maximum,

00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:57.920
maximum, penetration, because Sahaja Yoga,

00:57:58.080 --> 00:57:59.800
if you have understood, I don't know if you have understood

00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:02.440
or you are aware of it or not,

00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:07.720
but is learned through experience and through nothing else.

00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:13.320
You have to experience and then believe into it.

00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:17.080
It is not that what I told you is a conditioning on your mind,

00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:20.000
nothing, you experience it yourself and learn.

00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:23.320
But those who have that penetrating intelligence,

00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:26.800
who have that penetrating love, emotions

00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:31.400
and those [who] have that penetrating movement

00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:34.480
of their understanding,

00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:37.960
they are the ones who experience, learn, experience,

00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:40.480
learn, experience, learn.

00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:43.440
They do not allow their mind to play on them,

00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:45.640
"No, no, no.

00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:49.960
This mind of mine has got experiences of the past,

00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:52.640
and is based on that. No, I have to take everyday

00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:56.400
a new experience

00:58:56.640 --> 00:59:00.000
and that experience must be silenced within me,

00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:03.520
must be sustained within me,

00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:08.080
must be conditioned within me."

00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:14.760
Sahaja Yoga experiences are the good conditionings,

00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:17.520
"How can it be? I've seen it,

00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:23.200
I have faced it, I've had it. How can it be?".

00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:28.040
But for that also, to have the best experiences,

00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:31.600
first condition is of Rutambhara Pragnya,

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:33.760
where you should be of that level

00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:35.600
that you really get those experiences,

00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:40.120
otherwise you'll be just a mundane type of a person all the time,

00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:42.000
and you may live with Me,

00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:44.040
but you will not have those experiences,

00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:46.040
you'll not have that blissful feeling,

00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:49.440
nothing, that joy.

00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:57.360
So this penetration starts by your meditation

00:59:57.520 --> 00:59:59.880
and sustenance of the meditation,

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:06.400
and the Samadhi seed sprouting,

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:10.720
manifesting the new dimension within.

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:17.960
This sort of an attention, one has to develop,

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:21.520
by watching the attention, Chitta Nirodha.

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:23.360
As you watch your money,

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:26.240
as you watch your road when you drive,

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.960
as you watch your child when it is growing,

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:32.240
as you watch the beauty of your wife,

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:35.760
or the care of your husband.

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:41.240
All put together, you watch yourself, your attention,

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:43.520
where is it going?

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:47.640
Where is it lagging behind?

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:51.640
What is happening to my attention?

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:56.600
Such people have no problems.

01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:01.080
You'll be surprised, that such people

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:04.760
when they want to do something it becomes dynamic.

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:08.600
They can work it out. Nobody has any problem,

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:11.400
and if there is a problem,

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:12.960
which you are facing all the time,

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:17.200
in you then know there is something wrong with you.

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:20.520
Something is wrong with the instrument.

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:22.080
If you don't have a tin cutter

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:26.280
and you start using a knife to cut a tin, doesn't work out.

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:29.000
Then you'll say, "The tin is, something wrong with the tin",

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.320
or something wrong with you?

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:33.400
No, it's wrong with the instrument

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:36.480
and that instrument has to be corrected.

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:38.640
When the instrument is all right,

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:42.720
after all, with all the powers you have,

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:45.160
with all the blessings you have,

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:47.280
and the source of power behind it,

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:50.520
everything should work out. It should work out.

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:54.680
You have had experiences of things working out.

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:59.280
You have had experiences

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:04.360
of many of miracles happening before your eyes,

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:08.720
but still the attention has not settled down

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:12.720
with those experiences. Still 'gatanubhavas'

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:16.720
means the old experiences continue.

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:20.040
Old identifications continue.

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:22.240
You still continue with that

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:25.760
and the filth of that is still on your being.

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.640
Change everything.

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:30.640
Become a fresh new person.

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:35.560
You are blooming out as a flower

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.200
and then as a tree

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:40.360
and assume your position.

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:48.160
Assume your position as the Sahaj yogi.

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:52.480
So this attention must be brought round.

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:56.800
You judge yourself, where is your attention

01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:00.640
and what is the point of understanding?

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:04.560
What is the measure of understanding?

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:09.760
It's very simple: I have to be pleased.

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:13.560
Because I'm the attention.

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:18.800
If I am pleased then you have done the job.

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:22.040
But I cannot be pleased by mundane things,

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:27.640
by any arguments with that, but only by your ascent.

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:31.000
So you judge yourself on that.

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:34.640
Whether you give Me a flower,

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:36.920
or anything

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:41.920
I'm only pleased when the essence of that doing

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:47.200
has that height, has that special manifestation.

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:49.800
You say, "I love you very much Mother."

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:53.280
All right, you say,

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:56.680
but I must see that love that you are saying,

01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:02.920
or doing, has that essence that gives Me joy.

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:11.320
It's such a mutual thing between us, you can't imagine.

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:16.080
I can't live without you and you can't live without Me.

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:19.240
It's so mutual.

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:20.840
But from one side

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.400
it is absolutely hundred per cent benevolent.

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:26.880
Whether I get angry with you, whether I scold you,

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:29.840
whether I pamper you, whether I say, "Don't do that."

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:32.840
If I tell you, "Don't come very close to Me. Keep away",

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.880
anything that I do like that, is benevolent

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:42.520
to you.

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:46.080
And to Me the benevolence is only one,

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:51.080
that you should be emancipated,

01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:55.800
that you should gain something out of Me,

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:57.720
that you should prosper out of Me.

01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:00.080
Like the Mother Earth feels so elated

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:03.800
to see Her manifestation into these beautiful green trees,

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:09.320
it's like that. She's nothing. We stand on Her, we walk on Her.

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:13.600
Where do we see Her? But She sees us, in those.

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:16.960
It's a same sort of a situation.

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:20.200
She is the one who changes all the seasons.

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:23.400
'Rutambhara' means the one, the attention,

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:26.880
which changes the seasons. 'Rutu' means the seasons.

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:29.400
So all the seasons are created by Her

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:32.320
just to please us.

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:35.280
But what do we do, to please Her?

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:37.560
We exhaust Her, torture Her,

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:39.680
take out everything from Her, pollute it,

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:43.480
do all kinds of nonsensical things,

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:47.840
and then She gets angry.

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:50.520
The same thing that She is Love.

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:53.800
In the same love She becomes angry,

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:58.400
and then you have volcanoes, and you have earthquakes,

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:02.760
and all kinds of things happening to you.

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:07.320
But of course your Mother takes time to get angry.

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:12.080
Takes time. That doesn't mean you take time.

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:14.680
Look after yourselves, it's very important.

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:17.080
Suddenly you will find elevated.

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:19.320
Some people will just elevate themselves

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:21.720
and others will be completely cut out.

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:25.560
So be careful, I'm warning.

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:33.160
So today is the day, previous day to this fifteenth day.

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:39.800
And the fourteenth day, one has to become a killer.

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:43.160
Killer of all that is ignorance,

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:45.440
of all that is stupid, idiotic,

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:52.640
all that is cunning and all that is emotional.

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:56.800
Kill that part, become a Sahaja Yogi,

01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:01.680
tomorrow, to receive the blessings.

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:04.320
May God Bless you.
