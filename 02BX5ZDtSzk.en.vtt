WEBVTT

00:02.990 --> 00:10.681
Yesterday’s experience was that
the whole day I had to spend it

00:10.706 --> 00:16.126
with police people explaining to them.

00:16.151 --> 00:23.725
And now I feel that in Maharashtra,
there is a rule of Mafia.

00:23.750 --> 00:31.872
And that it is for us to face it
and we have to prove it.

00:31.897 --> 00:35.190
I am sorry some people were hurt
so badly

00:35.215 --> 00:38.080
and I'll think after Puja they’ll take
you to the hospital.

00:38.105 --> 00:43.751
Here there is a very nice hospital where
we have very good doctors.

00:43.776 --> 00:57.870
And then I would request you
to know that,

00:58.725 --> 01:07.788
the evil and the good, always has
to struggle and fight.

01:07.813 --> 01:17.146
Formerly in this great country of
Maharashtra all the saints were tortured,

01:17.171 --> 01:24.451
to such an extent that it is amazing
how despite all that

01:24.475 --> 01:31.693
they kept the banner of spirituality
so high.

01:31.718 --> 01:41.865
They are still existing, the same people,

01:41.890 --> 01:46.348
who have tortured the saints and I think
they are the same people

01:46.373 --> 01:53.573
who have behaved in such a bad manner
towards you all.

01:54.868 --> 02:03.139
This kind of ego-trip builds up
in everyone

02:03.164 --> 02:07.185
– even in among sahaja yogis, it does
build up.

02:07.210 --> 02:13.697
And they are all the time
on a different scene.

02:13.722 --> 02:22.992
This is like Hitler's style of behavior
that you pick up some sort of an issue.

02:23.017 --> 02:26.308
An issue could be anything, like they
are saying that

02:26.333 --> 02:29.330
“we are trying to remove all the blind
faiths”. I mean,

02:29.355 --> 02:34.715
I've done this for eighteen years,
what can they do more than that?

02:34.740 --> 02:38.147
And I have removed all your blind faiths
in all kinds of stupid things

02:38.172 --> 02:41.719
that the religion, so-called, was teaching
you.

02:41.744 --> 02:46.002
In every religion, there is no question
of only Hindu religion.

02:46.027 --> 02:48.628
But here they dare not say anything
about the Muslims

02:48.653 --> 02:51.460
because the Hindus are very mild people.

02:51.485 --> 02:55.306
They (the muslims) want that
all the temples must be removed,

02:55.331 --> 02:59.163
all the deities must be thrown away.

02:59.188 --> 03:05.410
This is all I think Rajneesh is their guru
because he made a...

03:06.797 --> 03:16.750
he made an exhibition where he tried
to show

03:16.775 --> 03:20.922
that Ganapati was something very funny
and all that.

03:20.947 --> 03:23.652
Now medically you know in Sahaja Yoga,

03:23.652 --> 03:28.895
that without Ganesha we cannot cure
many diseases. Is a fact.

03:28.920 --> 03:33.078
So a stupid fellow talking like that,
has become now the guru of these people

03:33.103 --> 03:36.651
who are discarded all over the world
and who have been insulted.

03:36.676 --> 03:41.856
So these few newspapers have made
him as a guru, perhaps that

03:41.881 --> 03:46.210
they are following his methods of saying
that we should be,

03:46.235 --> 03:49.713
we should be rid of all these ideas
and this and that.

03:49.738 --> 03:57.130
But they have gone to the extent that
all the spirituality is an illusion.

03:58.495 --> 04:02.710
It's such a joke. And that we should
give up

04:02.735 --> 04:09.531
all the, all readings and all understanding
about spirituality.

04:09.531 --> 04:14.093
But they do not know that their heritage
is spirituality.

04:14.118 --> 04:17.556
And the whole world depends on that.

04:17.581 --> 04:22.049
The whole world, because when the people
took to industrial development,

04:22.074 --> 04:25.224
you know how far they have gone
and how much they are lost.

04:25.249 --> 04:29.062
And how far you were in that mess.
And how you came back

04:29.087 --> 04:31.844
because of Sahaja Yoga’s spirituality.

04:31.884 --> 04:39.652
Now if this nourishment from the roots
of spirituality

04:39.677 --> 04:44.511
does not reach the West, the real
knowledge, as it is in Sahaja Yoga,

04:44.536 --> 04:49.325
the West will be finished. West will be
finished, you know that very well.

04:49.350 --> 04:53.854
There is no joy, there is no love,
there is no poetry,

04:53.879 --> 04:58.150
there is no music, there is no culture.

04:59.945 --> 05:06.130
But as you have understood that now
these people have now started

05:06.155 --> 05:09.046
talking about “no religion”
“no religion”,

05:09.071 --> 05:12.179
like many of your western countries
have also done,

05:12.204 --> 05:14.682
specially Russia has done that way,

05:14.707 --> 05:17.626
that there is nothing like God,
there is nothing like this and that.

05:17.651 --> 05:21.665
And now after all that now they
are coming to God.

05:21.690 --> 05:25.059
So now we’ll have to go through
another circle.

05:25.084 --> 05:28.654
But they are only hardly twenty people.

05:28.679 --> 05:35.092
So even one fellow who is like Hitler,
can destroy the whole thing.

05:35.117 --> 05:41.466
This is a very important thing - to destroy
something you need only one person.

05:41.491 --> 05:49.734
But to sustain and to construct
you need many people.

05:49.759 --> 05:56.824
To drown a ship, you need only
one hole in it.

05:56.849 --> 06:02.995
But to build the ship, you take months
together.

06:03.020 --> 06:07.177
So the work that is done for these
last eighteen years

06:07.202 --> 06:10.885
of Sahaja Yoga, is really tremendous.

06:10.910 --> 06:14.085
And the truth about it, you know
for definite,

06:14.110 --> 06:19.172
that it has helped so many people. Though
we have been going from ups and downs

06:19.197 --> 06:22.794
and all that, we've been doing wrong
things, no doubt about it,

06:22.819 --> 06:29.273
but still, now we are quite established
and we know what Sahaja Yoga is.

06:29.298 --> 06:36.484
The experience of Sahaja Yoga you all
have had. We have seen so many,

06:36.509 --> 06:40.510
(towards someone…) “What is she doing?
Please be seated”.

06:41.441 --> 06:46.016
Miraculous photographs you have seen,
so many miracles in your life day to day.

06:46.041 --> 06:51.239
Every day there are miracles. Now to say
there is no God

06:51.264 --> 06:55.205
is impossible for you because you have
felt the miracles

06:55.230 --> 06:59.589
of this All-pervading Power,
the Paramchaitanya.

06:59.614 --> 07:03.035
And also all the religions are explained

07:03.060 --> 07:08.570
and the complete integration of them
has been brought in.

07:08.595 --> 07:14.033
But for that we have to know, as I told
you in Brahmapuri,

07:14.058 --> 07:18.506
that the sahaja yogis have to know that
they have to become dynamic.

07:18.531 --> 07:25.618
Whatever energies you have got, whatever
you have achieved within yourselves,

07:25.643 --> 07:30.718
is not sufficient enough. You have
to manifest.

07:30.743 --> 07:35.105
And in that dynamism, I think people
get lost.

07:35.130 --> 07:38.458
I have seen that some leaders become
horrid.

07:38.483 --> 07:43.268
I mean, sometimes their Vishuddhis could
be horrible, then their heart goes out.

07:43.304 --> 07:50.483
So you should not allow anybody (to be)
a leader for more than one month.

07:50.508 --> 07:55.685
It goes off. I have seen it. Because your
balloon has been already bloated

07:55.710 --> 08:01.361
and again it gets re-bloated in no time.
(speaking in Marathi…).

08:04.732 --> 08:11.466
They have religiously kept all the Indians
outside, I think. (speaking in Marathi…).

08:14.247 --> 08:17.397
I mean, he is the organizer here.

08:19.456 --> 08:22.723
(speaking Marathi)

08:25.278 --> 08:30.720
So the heritage of our country is
spirituality.

08:33.099 --> 08:37.260
And this is the nourishment.

08:37.285 --> 08:46.539
Only the one-sided growth in the West, due
to machinery or whatever you may call it,

08:47.407 --> 08:51.333
has ruined it completely.

08:51.358 --> 08:54.625
And one-sided growth in this country,
and all such countries,

08:54.650 --> 09:01.858
where religion has become a blind faith,
has also ruined it.

09:01.883 --> 09:06.646
But in the center lies Sahaja Yoga.

09:06.671 --> 09:13.741
Now your wisdom, your sense,
is so apparent.

09:13.766 --> 09:19.517
I mean, people have been to all kinds
of gurus here and have been to everyone,

09:19.542 --> 09:23.988
but they don’t know anything about
anything. Except for remembering by heart

09:24.013 --> 09:28.384
- some these Hare Ramas, talk about,
“Rama” “Rama” – like that.

09:28.409 --> 09:31.339
While you know everything about Kundalini.
You know how to raise it.

09:31.364 --> 09:34.719
You know how to give Realization. You know
what are the diseases are caused,

09:34.744 --> 09:38.836
how to cure it and everything and
everything and everything.

09:38.861 --> 09:44.923
I mean, it has come to such a stage
that nobody asks Me any questions.

09:47.301 --> 09:51.014
Otherwise, in the beginning in London,
My lecture was for five minutes

09:51.039 --> 09:56.571
and the questions were for the rest
of the time.

09:56.596 --> 10:01.202
So now you know so much.

10:03.651 --> 10:10.006
And you accept which cannot be explained
also, because you know that.

10:10.031 --> 10:15.084
For example, somebody will ask Me,
“Mother, how do you get these photographs?”

10:15.109 --> 10:18.683
Why are we talking about it?

10:18.708 --> 10:25.330
I know how it happens, who is doing
this trick. But I don’t want to tell you.

10:28.526 --> 10:30.680
Moreover, if you demand something,
I’ll never tell you.

10:30.705 --> 10:32.917
That’s one of the characters I have.

10:32.942 --> 10:37.965
Ah, if you come with humble thing
and honest desire to know,

10:37.990 --> 10:40.894
then I can tell you about everything,
that you want to know.

10:40.919 --> 10:43.911
But if you just want to force Me and say
that, “I challenge you”,

10:43.936 --> 10:46.829
I said, “I also challenge you.
Get out of here”.

10:46.854 --> 10:49.995
Like that. You see, it doesn’t react,
that way.

10:50.020 --> 10:56.248
So it is just the temperament
of the Divine

10:56.288 --> 11:03.212
that if you are convex, the Divine
becomes convex also,

11:03.237 --> 11:08.554
and fights and says, “No, get out”.
If you become concave,

11:08.579 --> 11:17.114
then it emits and gives knowledge,
or receives knowledge.

11:17.139 --> 11:23.105
So one has to be humble. That’s very
important part of it. One has to be humble.

11:23.130 --> 11:31.385
So the awareness, again I talk about
awareness,

11:31.410 --> 11:36.457
within you should be that, how much
we have come to know about ourselves.

11:36.482 --> 11:39.936
How much we have to come to know
about others?

11:39.961 --> 11:47.555
How much we know about our own being?
How much we know about chakras?

11:47.580 --> 11:51.421
In such a short time, how did we come
to know about it?

11:51.446 --> 11:55.470
Like we should know, if you are dealing
with a computer,

11:55.495 --> 12:02.729
and you know how computer works, how
it acts, how it is programmed, everything

12:02.754 --> 12:08.669
without programming it, without working
it out, without building it up.

12:08.694 --> 12:11.946
I mean, if you build it up, you know
how it works. But without doing that

12:11.971 --> 12:16.018
just to know a computer how it works,
and all the machinery about it,

12:16.043 --> 12:19.642
is a tremendous knowledge.

12:19.667 --> 12:23.319
And this is what has to be there
for all of us

12:23.344 --> 12:27.515
to know what we are there as human beings,
and what we have to do

12:27.642 --> 12:32.605
to emancipate the other human beings.

12:33.195 --> 12:37.620
Of course, I shouldn’t say that every
sahaja yogi is of that level, no.

12:37.645 --> 12:42.957
Or comes up, but everybody is trying.
Nobody has denied Sahaja Yoga.

12:42.982 --> 12:47.343
Nobody has said it’s not true. Everybody
is trying to get

12:47.368 --> 12:53.744
higher and higher in his state
of spirituality which doesn’t speak.

12:53.769 --> 13:00.367
It acts. It doesn’t manipulate. It acts.

13:00.392 --> 13:04.816
And we've seen it acts in so many
miraculous ways.

13:04.841 --> 13:10.434
So first to know about all these things,
after feeling that Paramchaitanya,

13:10.459 --> 13:14.711
is different from just to talk about it.

13:14.736 --> 13:18.817
Many have talked about it, but you have
never felt it.

13:18.842 --> 13:23.746
Now you have felt it, you have verified it,
you have experimented it.

13:23.771 --> 13:29.197
And you have found it that, this is
something absolutely real.

13:29.222 --> 13:37.661
In science, as Dr. Khan was telling Me,
that in science,

13:37.686 --> 13:44.335
the one theory which is established today
might be refuted tomorrow.

13:44.360 --> 13:48.873
Another theory that is established,
may be refuted.

13:48.898 --> 13:53.101
It goes on. So that no theory is
an absolute theory.

13:53.126 --> 13:57.899
But in Sahaja Yoga for the last eighteen
years, whatever I have been saying

13:57.924 --> 14:04.160
is the truth. And is absolute. It cannot
be challenged again.

14:04.185 --> 14:07.539
Nobody can say, “No, Mother,
it is not so”.

14:07.564 --> 14:12.993
A simple thing is, somebody comes to you
and you say, the other day it happened,

14:13.018 --> 14:19.481
one doctor was there in Aurangabad,
and he said that,

14:22.796 --> 14:28.023
“I have never had any guru”. But his left
Swadhistana…

14:28.048 --> 14:31.572
and he was looking very disturbed. He was
a sahaja yogi in a way,

14:31.597 --> 14:36.305
not looking normal. “I have pain
in the stomach,” and this and that.

14:36.330 --> 14:41.778
I asked him, “You had no guru?”,
he said, “No”. (speaking Marathi).

15:55.784 --> 16:00.904
So now as science has progressed
we can see clearly

16:00.929 --> 16:05.996
that it has not got the theory
which is absolute.

16:06.021 --> 16:11.873
But in Sahaja Yoga, as I told you,
there was a gentleman, a doctor,

16:11.898 --> 16:15.323
who was denying, he said, “I had no guru”.
I asked him, “Do you read books?”,

16:15.348 --> 16:21.613
“Yes – he said - I read Vivekananda”.
I said, “That’s it”.

16:21.638 --> 16:25.345
He said he was reading the book
of a particular guru.

16:25.370 --> 16:30.855
We gave a bandhan to that guru
and this fellow felt alright.

16:33.630 --> 16:37.569
There are so many things one has to know
about.

16:37.594 --> 16:45.279
Little, little things are there, which must
be understood in Sahaja Yoga.

16:45.304 --> 16:51.959
And one should do it according to them,
because it is for your benevolence.

16:51.984 --> 16:59.752
Now supposing I say, “Just do these
things”. If you don’t accept Me,

16:59.777 --> 17:03.429
why am I telling you? I am not telling you
because I have to gain anything.

17:03.454 --> 17:08.777
But is for your good. Now if you don’t
want to accept me or if you react,

17:08.802 --> 17:12.785
is not going to help you. Sahaja Yoga
is not for Me, is for you.

17:12.810 --> 17:17.014
Now if you are, truthfully, honestly,
if you are seekers,

17:17.039 --> 17:22.254
then you must know that "My aim
is to rise spiritually".

17:22.279 --> 17:24.955
Now in science you have risen quite a lot,
you are fed up with it.

17:24.980 --> 17:27.974
Now you’re back into spirituality

17:27.999 --> 17:31.747
and for spirituality you have to be
a subtler person.

17:31.773 --> 17:36.119
And for these subtleties you have
to give up all your conditionings.

17:36.144 --> 17:40.077
All funny conditionings are to be given
and the worst that you have,

17:40.102 --> 17:46.132
is the ego part. It just jumps up. I have
seen that appointing people leaders

17:46.165 --> 17:51.130
has been the greatest harmful thing
I have done to them.

17:51.155 --> 17:55.379
So many of them just got lost, because
they became leaders.

17:55.404 --> 18:00.348
I mean, a kind of a Hitler, enters
into them.

18:00.373 --> 18:03.597
So this is one of the worst conditionings
we have.

18:03.622 --> 18:10.289
We have to be very careful that we don’t
try to assert our ego on others.

18:10.314 --> 18:13.783
When we become leaders or a some position
is given to us,

18:13.808 --> 18:22.890
or ask something is to be achieved
through your authority.

18:22.915 --> 18:25.757
Only we have the authority of God.

18:25.782 --> 18:32.185
Unless and until we become humble
like that, nothing is going to flow.

18:32.210 --> 18:39.113
You can see that, that the sea lies
the lowest in height.

18:39.138 --> 18:43.256
And all the rivers and everything flows
to the sea.

18:43.281 --> 18:47.729
And from the sea only rises the rain.

18:47.754 --> 18:53.293
Supposing sea was somewhere on top
of Himalayas,

18:53.318 --> 19:03.763
we would have been all living
in the Sahara desert.

19:04.569 --> 19:10.445
Is a very simple thing, is to be humble
- that’s first sign - is to be humble,

19:10.470 --> 19:19.412
is to be non-violent, because we depend
on the All-pervading Power.

19:19.437 --> 19:24.418
It is a power which is completely
integrated within us.

19:24.443 --> 19:30.985
Only we are not the ones, we want
to be aware of it.

19:31.665 --> 19:36.428
So this ignorance, this blindness,
if it disappears from us,

19:36.461 --> 19:41.574
that Divine Power will manifest.

19:41.599 --> 19:46.811
But our styles are so complicated.

19:46.836 --> 19:50.565
Sometimes I just don’t understand,

19:51.163 --> 19:56.728
why we have complicated ourselves
so much.

19:56.753 --> 20:03.350
I mean, look at the flowers, look at
the leaves; they are on a tree, supposing.

20:03.375 --> 20:09.629
Automatically they will open out
to the sun. Automatically.

20:09.654 --> 20:13.067
You don’t have to take a leaf towards
the sun, not at all.

20:13.092 --> 20:15.871
Automatically it opens out. You have
seen it every day.

20:15.896 --> 20:19.129
Automatically. Because it requires sun.

20:19.154 --> 20:25.366
Now you want to have spirit in yourself.
You want to get to spirit.

20:25.391 --> 20:30.552
So automatically you should, really
automatically, if that is your desire,

20:30.577 --> 20:38.592
you should, with your own desire only,
should get to the light of the spirit.

20:38.617 --> 20:46.339
And should grow in that spirit to know
that this is what you have to achieve.

20:48.825 --> 20:52.329
But small things disturb you,

20:52.354 --> 20:56.711
like somebody doesn’t get married. Next
day you see the face of that person,

20:56.736 --> 21:01.833
as if somebody has died in the family
he is sitting there.

21:01.861 --> 21:08.876
Really, I have seen it. Immediately I make
out who has not been yet engaged.

21:11.197 --> 21:15.852
Then after marriage I find again
the same sort of nonsense.

21:15.877 --> 21:21.204
Because they are analyzing, “I want
this kind, I want that kind. I want”.

21:21.229 --> 21:26.435
I mean, whatever is available here
is available.

21:30.629 --> 21:36.583
Like on the ship, you don’t have any
problems, because you have no solutions.

21:36.608 --> 21:39.026
If you are moving on a ship and you
just ask for something,

21:39.051 --> 21:43.266
“Oh no, not available here,” finished.

21:46.905 --> 21:51.244
But then you lose all the fun of Sahaja
Yoga for a small little nonsensical thing.

21:51.269 --> 21:56.905
If not this, next year. What is
so important?

21:56.930 --> 22:03.357
I mean, certain there are limitations
of age, height, this, that.

22:03.382 --> 22:08.205
Then even if you arrange their marriages,
is very interesting,

22:08.230 --> 22:11.060
then they come and tell you, “No, no,
I would not like to marry this girl”.

22:11.085 --> 22:14.058
Why? “Because I want such and such”.
All right, then we find.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.995
“No, no, no, she is no good. She has
these things,” so move that.

22:17.020 --> 22:21.583
I mean this is not the way. You are not
here to choose a girl for yourself.

22:21.608 --> 22:25.431
Then there is another one who can say,
“All right, I came down, I saw one girl

22:25.456 --> 22:32.369
and fell in love”. So you fall in love
and get out. This nonsense going on.

22:32.394 --> 22:39.202
See, you must have certain amount
of dignity. You are all sahaja yogis.

22:39.234 --> 22:42.304
And when I see all this kind
of stupid attitude,

22:42.329 --> 22:47.744
I say these people can never gain
in Sahaja Yoga.

22:48.709 --> 22:54.433
In India you will be surprised. I mean,

22:55.171 --> 22:59.953
even I was married to a man who was
from another, another place.

22:59.978 --> 23:04.652
Absolutely different country, different
religion, different everything.

23:04.677 --> 23:06.810
And a different person.

23:06.835 --> 23:11.268
So one can say that it was a very
unconventional marriage, one can say.

23:11.293 --> 23:17.171
But I would never touch this man
or he would never touch me.

23:17.196 --> 23:21.863
And if he would talk to me,
in the presence of others only.

23:23.184 --> 23:28.224
And despite that, our marriage is very
strong and we are very happy couple.

23:28.249 --> 23:31.008
With all these nonsense you go on doing,
bringing it to the level

23:31.033 --> 23:34.753
of physical appearances, physical
understanding, your ego,

23:34.778 --> 23:40.354
“I want this, I want that”, you find that
just after the marriage you get off.

23:40.379 --> 23:43.406
You start analyzing. That’s why
I am telling you today.

23:43.431 --> 23:48.982
I may not able to talk to you about
marriages later on. That be careful.

23:49.007 --> 23:53.240
And that’s how you have brought
problems to Me.

23:54.523 --> 23:58.484
You see, once you accept that in Sahaja
Yoga you are going to marry,

23:58.509 --> 24:02.473
then you must accept that Sahaja Yoga
has its own norms and styles

24:02.498 --> 24:07.447
by which it will marry you and will look
after your marriage and will bless you.

24:07.472 --> 24:12.040
But if you start analyzing
and misbehaving,

24:12.065 --> 24:16.084
it’s not going to work out, and you
will have lots of problems.

24:16.109 --> 24:23.570
Either you believe in the All-pervading
Power and surrender your ego to it,

24:23.595 --> 24:28.081
or else you have your ego.

24:30.676 --> 24:35.349
Sahaja Yoga is decided by Me,
by Paramchaitanya.

24:35.374 --> 24:42.870
Now sometimes in Sahaja Yoga it may
happen that, maybe, it may not work out.

24:42.895 --> 24:51.376
But invariably I have seen, invariably,
is none of My faults. None of My faults.

24:51.401 --> 24:54.925
Mostly the leaders have given wrong
information,

24:54.950 --> 25:00.061
mostly the leaders didn’t talk about
the, about the background.

25:00.086 --> 25:10.378
Or maybe that there has been some sort
of an ego-trip with the people,

25:10.403 --> 25:14.830
and they are the ones who are creating
problems for us.

25:15.610 --> 25:20.798
But things work out. Slowly, gradually
we can improve. We must have patience.

25:20.823 --> 25:25.053
If only on first day you start demanding
something doing that,

25:25.078 --> 25:28.651
it’s not going to work out.

25:29.902 --> 25:35.555
We must learn to give, in marriage
it’s an adjustment of giving.

25:35.580 --> 25:39.899
It is no adjustment of demand.

25:40.532 --> 25:44.995
We have to give. We have to sacrifice.

25:45.020 --> 25:49.960
What is there with you to sacrifice is
all these rubbish things.

25:49.985 --> 25:54.103
Your spirit you cannot sacrifice,
so you keep to your spirit.

25:54.128 --> 25:57.816
And live with it. What is you going
to sacrifice?

25:57.841 --> 26:01.600
I mean, what do you have to give?

26:02.468 --> 26:06.435
And then only you will enjoy.

26:07.483 --> 26:15.416
Then only you will enjoy the spirit.
I am getting cool breeze from you.

26:17.191 --> 26:25.384
So I want you to be very great sahaja
yogis, very great.

26:25.409 --> 26:31.974
And you should really manifest
your powers of wisdom.

26:31.999 --> 26:35.281
Now men have ego part and women
have another side,

26:35.306 --> 26:39.479
is that they are very dull sometimes.
Extremely dull.

26:39.504 --> 26:45.461
They don’t think they have to play a very
dynamic role, while they are the shaktis.

26:45.486 --> 26:50.564
Like they will not even clap hands,
they will not even have their torches

26:50.589 --> 26:56.974
to see what’s happening. Nothing. They just
think they are just a, sort of parasites.

26:56.999 --> 27:02.299
Just coming here as wives or sisters,
or whatever it is, wearing saris.

27:02.324 --> 27:06.612
No, you have to be extremely dynamic.

27:06.637 --> 27:10.471
You must know all about Sahaja Yoga.
You must know all about chakras.

27:10.496 --> 27:15.116
You should know everything. In India,
when in the ancient times,

27:15.141 --> 27:18.737
they used to teach them about God,
religion and all that.

27:18.762 --> 27:23.480
So many great ladies we had, Gargi
and Maitreyi and all those,

27:23.505 --> 27:27.089
who were very learned women.

27:27.114 --> 27:32.924
So in no way you should be just women who
do not know anything of Sahaja Yoga.

27:32.949 --> 27:36.782
Sahaja Yoga is not only meant for men;
it’s meant for you, much more for you.

27:36.807 --> 27:42.112
Because you are shakti and I am your
Mother. So I find the women lack that.

27:42.137 --> 27:45.928
They are more worried about the saris,
the this and that, and I mean,

27:45.953 --> 27:52.180
now from the hair-dressing they have
come to saris. That’s what I feel.

27:53.462 --> 27:56.831
Well, it’s just the same.

27:58.951 --> 28:02.252
Of course sari is a very good dress.
It’s nice to wear.

28:02.277 --> 28:05.862
By that we give lot of encouragement
to our weavers in India.

28:05.887 --> 28:09.892
It’s very artistic, and good that
represents also

28:09.917 --> 28:16.060
a very lady-like feminine thing. But that
doesn’t mean you should become so feminine

28:16.085 --> 28:20.280
that you don’t understand Sahaja Yoga.

28:20.305 --> 28:27.259
I have seen women don’t know where
the centers are of the feet.

28:28.549 --> 28:33.915
Indian women know. Men do know….
Indian women know,

28:33.940 --> 28:38.707
but the Western women don’t know,
so many of them.

28:38.732 --> 28:42.040
They don’t know about chakras. They don’t
know how to raise the Kundalini.

28:42.065 --> 28:44.339
They don’t know what’s the problem is.

28:44.364 --> 28:47.860
So once you have left that life, where
you are wearing a sari,

28:47.885 --> 28:52.890
doesn’t mean now that you have become
a woman in the gosha.

28:52.915 --> 28:56.962
Gosha is the one where they have to wear
chadar; chadar, they call it.

28:56.987 --> 29:02.022
No, sari means you can also be
very dynamic.

29:02.047 --> 29:06.610
The same sari that you are wearing,
even the saris of the nine yards,

29:06.635 --> 29:10.902
we have had queens who fought
the English.

29:10.927 --> 29:15.330
You have must heard about Jhansi Ki Rani.
She was hardly of any age.

29:15.355 --> 29:20.152
She jumped from eighty feet height with
her child behind her. She was a widow.

29:20.177 --> 29:25.932
And she fought the English. Left and right.
And when she was killed,

29:25.957 --> 29:32.151
the person who was here, the Englishman,
he said, the governor,

29:32.176 --> 29:38.796
he said, “We have won the war but
the glory goes to Jhansi ki Rani.”

29:39.977 --> 29:46.238
Then we had another one, Chand-bibi,
another lady, in a ...

29:48.590 --> 29:55.992
Ahmednagar; she fought. We had
so many women like that.

29:56.017 --> 30:00.670
Tremendous type of women we had,
though they lived like women.

30:00.695 --> 30:07.939
We had Padmini, we had Noorjahan,
we had Ahilyabai, so many women.

30:07.964 --> 30:12.625
They were not manly at all.
Very woman-like.

30:12.650 --> 30:17.867
There was the last one was Shivaji’s,
Shivaji’s daughter-in-law.

30:17.892 --> 30:20.707
She was only seventeen years of age,
seventeen years.

30:20.732 --> 30:25.026
And she fought this Aurangzeb and she
is the one who defeated him.

30:25.051 --> 30:29.166
Nobody could manage this Aurangzeb
horrible fellow, she defeated him.

30:29.191 --> 30:34.544
So though, you see, the Indian women look
so docile and simple,

30:34.569 --> 30:43.070
but when it comes to their personality,
they are capable of tremendous things.

30:46.563 --> 30:52.914
So this character when you are wearing
the saris you must also know how to tie up

30:52.939 --> 30:57.197
the backside and to fight.

30:59.254 --> 31:04.818
Otherwise you have not got the Sahaj
culture in you.

31:04.843 --> 31:11.999
Either you are very dominating or you are
so docile like cabbages.

31:12.024 --> 31:19.752
You must understand that we have
to be alert, very alert.

31:19.777 --> 31:23.828
And Mother depends on us. On our own
personalities,

31:23.853 --> 31:28.222
that the way we are going to develop
ourselves, our children, our husbands,

31:28.247 --> 31:32.127
our society of Sahaja Yoga, the whole
of Vishwa Nirmal Dharma.

31:32.152 --> 31:36.744
Is the woman who makes the society.

31:37.361 --> 31:46.655
The whole universe is in the hands
of a woman who creates children.

31:47.617 --> 31:53.390
So the stupid ideas of romanticism
and all this nonsense,

31:53.415 --> 31:56.577
has to be finished. The possession
of husband –

31:56.602 --> 32:00.830
“What time you came,” “When did you go,”
“Where did you go,”

32:00.855 --> 32:04.696
and here the women when Shivaji
started his fight

32:04.721 --> 32:11.633
they used to cut their finger, thumb,
and used to put the tika

32:11.658 --> 32:14.854
on the forehead of the husbands who
were going in the war

32:14.879 --> 32:19.694
and they said, “Don’t come showing
your back”.

32:21.914 --> 32:24.733
Such great women we have had
in this Maharashtra,

32:24.758 --> 32:27.870
where you find them to be so mild.

32:27.895 --> 32:32.883
If it comes to their country, if it comes
to their own personality,

32:32.908 --> 32:39.749
to their own chastity or anything, they are
tremendous. Just like lionesses.

32:39.781 --> 32:43.643
So with this sari lots of things go
hand in hand.

32:43.668 --> 32:46.991
Is not only the sari you are wearing,
but you are representing

32:47.016 --> 32:52.402
something very dynamic within
yourself.

32:54.340 --> 32:58.919
Now when we talk about our further
programs

32:58.944 --> 33:03.390
people are insisting that we should have
a program in any case in Kolhapur.

33:03.415 --> 33:05.853
But I told them I’ll not allow sahaja yogis
to go there

33:05.878 --> 33:10.711
because they were hurt so badly. But some
of you can come, not all of you.

33:10.736 --> 33:13.889
I would be rather worried. I don’t think
anybody will hurt you

33:13.914 --> 33:16.785
and they are saying they will make
arrangements.

33:16.810 --> 33:22.888
So if you want to come, if you are
not afraid...

33:38.034 --> 33:43.457
But on one promise. That nobody is going
to beat anyone.

33:43.482 --> 33:46.799
I am saying, “Don’t beat. Don’t beat”
and somebody heard, “Beat”.

33:46.824 --> 33:51.742
I mean, I mean, I have never heard such
sort of thing, when I am saying

33:51.767 --> 33:55.113
on the thing that, “Don’t beat.
Don’t beat,”

33:55.138 --> 33:59.078
then somebody hears that, “Beat them.
Beat them”.

33:59.892 --> 34:03.506
I just don’t understand how can
(that be).

34:03.531 --> 34:09.482
So you don’t have to, really, you don’t
have to beat anyone.

34:09.507 --> 34:12.797
There is no need. You know that
there is Paramchaitanya working.

34:12.822 --> 34:17.775
All this is also the work
of Paramchaitanya. In the afternoon,

34:17.800 --> 34:21.901
Yogi Mahajan was discussing with Me
very seriously like a lawyer,

34:21.926 --> 34:26.032
saying that, “Mother we cannot form
a criminal case on them,

34:26.057 --> 34:33.746
because there is no evidence”. Afternoon.
And in the evening we have evidence now.

34:43.776 --> 34:48.263
And then they are writing in the other way
round, that they were beaten up

34:48.295 --> 34:52.905
and that you threw stones at them.
And none of them were injured.

34:52.930 --> 34:57.308
They must have been vibrated stones,
I think.

35:00.746 --> 35:06.677
How can you? They had no injuries. They
wrote it down they've no injuries.

35:06.702 --> 35:09.967
So there is no need for you to bother
about it.

35:09.992 --> 35:14.739
With all that there were at least more
than four hundred stones that came

35:14.764 --> 35:20.651
and only eighteen people got hurt. And
really seriously, I think, one or two.

35:20.676 --> 35:25.955
So there is nothing and I can cure
all of you, [you] know that very well.

35:38.188 --> 35:41.574
On the whole, you see this country,
especially Maharashtra,

35:41.599 --> 35:45.540
is so full of devotion to God.

35:45.565 --> 35:48.930
Like these things are not going to work
out. But they are very dangerous people

35:48.955 --> 35:55.091
like Hitler, you see, they start moving
about and giving some ideas and all that.

35:55.116 --> 35:59.252
So it is better to finish them at the time
when they are just prospering,

35:59.277 --> 36:04.018
as they call themselves Nirmulan,
is to remove the roots.

36:04.043 --> 36:09.264
So we have to do the Nirmulan
of Nirmulan.

36:09.289 --> 36:13.634
All right. So now today we'll have
the puja.

36:13.659 --> 36:21.717
Then after that if you want you can go
to Kolhapur for your purchase.

36:21.742 --> 36:25.558
But it starts, the shops starts quite late
and will keep quite late till eight

36:25.583 --> 36:30.628
and tomorrow the whole day is available
for you. So you can take your buses.

36:30.653 --> 36:36.038
You can go down there, and you can have
your purchase and all that,

36:36.063 --> 36:39.564
then come back here. Tomorrow also
you can do the same.

36:39.589 --> 36:45.699
Day after tomorrow, our Mr. Govind has
very kindly invited you all to his place,

36:45.724 --> 36:50.910
as it is he is an extremely generous man.
So,

37:02.015 --> 37:04.435
and when I told him that, “You must
take money from Me”,

37:04.476 --> 37:07.136
he was just fighting with Me, “Mother,
give me this first chance.

37:07.161 --> 37:12.559
This is my great honor that…(speaking
Marathi and Hindi to someone)

37:16.679 --> 37:21.587
So… Let them come, if they want to come.”

37:28.614 --> 37:32.196
So then the program is that day
after tomorrow,

37:32.221 --> 37:37.179
after this thing he says it will be over
by 12:30 or one′o clock.

37:37.204 --> 37:41.581
So you will have tonight and tomorrow
full day for your shopping.

37:41.606 --> 37:45.123
But I think then you should not bother
more about shopping.

37:45.148 --> 37:47.705
Whatever you have to do, better finish
tomorrow.

37:47.730 --> 37:50.663
And then you have to come
to the program also.

37:50.688 --> 37:54.441
Day after if you linger on then it will
be very difficult.

37:54.466 --> 38:00.316
So all of you should go there, have your
food, and then go to Ganapatipule.

38:00.341 --> 38:04.371
This is the program. So you reach
Ganapatipule in the evening.

38:04.396 --> 38:06.912
I hope it’s all clear to you.

38:06.937 --> 38:10.897
And whatever you want to buy, you have
to buy here. But I would say

38:10.922 --> 38:15.363
that some of you are really, really
do not know what is real silk is.

38:15.388 --> 38:18.420
And I've seen some people buying
something horrid.

38:18.445 --> 38:22.337
And very thin silk you should not buy
because it will last only for eight days.

38:22.362 --> 38:25.418
And then it will be finished. So don’t go
for cheap things.

38:25.443 --> 38:30.644
One sari which is good sari, silk sari,
is better than ten bad saris.

38:30.669 --> 38:35.022
Luckily now we have some saris that you
wanted for, the printed saris

38:35.047 --> 38:39.875
which I can give you in Ganapatipule.
Nice printed saris,

38:39.900 --> 38:47.055
of the tassar and also silk. We’ll have
them there. You can all buy, there.

38:48.486 --> 38:51.045
Anything else?

38:51.624 --> 38:57.553
Because I don’t think I’ll meet you any
more perhaps till we go to Ganapatipule.

38:57.578 --> 39:02.805
Now also if you could get those
bhajan things, please buy.

39:02.830 --> 39:06.656
I have given you presents twice. But you
never bring them on your tour

39:06.681 --> 39:12.226
and this time again, I don’t want to get
this kind of a thing. (Hindi).

39:12.251 --> 39:19.260
Just show them. Anything of this kind,
please get it. Is very important.

39:19.285 --> 39:24.686
I have given you twice as presents
but it’s very difficult every time

39:24.711 --> 39:30.887
to go to the shop and get it for you.
If you can get them please buy.

39:30.912 --> 39:37.101
Some of you should at least have them.
(speaking marathi to someone)

39:45.453 --> 39:49.538
He will organize, you better purchase.

39:56.218 --> 40:02.556
Now all the marriages practically have
been decided. One or two are left,

40:02.581 --> 40:07.833
which he has also adjusted. Now those who
were over age or something like that,

40:07.858 --> 40:10.428
we could not arrange their marriages.
Doesn’t matter.

40:10.453 --> 40:13.194
It may work out, it may not work out.
Doesn’t matter.

40:13.219 --> 40:17.570
After all, you are in Sahaja Yoga. I mean,
you are really married to Sahaja Yoga,

40:17.595 --> 40:22.085
that’s all. This is something sideways,
you see.

40:22.110 --> 40:25.398
So don’t make very, your life
miserable,

40:25.423 --> 40:28.920
so all the way you have come, to know
that you are not ...

40:28.945 --> 40:33.139
we have not been able to arrange
your marriage. It’s not proper.

40:33.164 --> 40:36.920
Just enjoy. Don’t miss the point.

40:36.945 --> 40:40.226
May God bless you.
