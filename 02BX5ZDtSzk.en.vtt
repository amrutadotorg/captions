00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:10.681
Yesterday’s experience was that
the whole day I had to spend it

00:00:10.706 --> 00:00:16.126
with police people explaining to them.

00:00:16.151 --> 00:00:23.725
And now I feel that in Maharashtra,
there is a rule of Mafia.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:31.872
And that it is for us to face it
and we have to prove it.

00:00:31.897 --> 00:00:35.190
I am sorry some people were hurt
so badly

00:00:35.215 --> 00:00:38.080
and I'll think after Puja they’ll take
you to the hospital.

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:43.751
Here there is a very nice hospital where
we have very good doctors.

00:00:43.776 --> 00:00:57.870
And then I would request you
to know that,

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:07.788
the evil and the good, always has
to struggle and fight.

00:01:07.813 --> 00:01:17.146
Formerly in this great country of
Maharashtra all the saints were tortured,

00:01:17.171 --> 00:01:24.451
to such an extent that it is amazing
how despite all that

00:01:24.475 --> 00:01:31.693
they kept the banner of spirituality
so high.

00:01:31.718 --> 00:01:41.865
They are still existing, the same people,

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.348
who have tortured the saints and I think
they are the same people

00:01:46.373 --> 00:01:53.573
who have behaved in such a bad manner
towards you all.

00:01:54.868 --> 00:02:03.139
This kind of ego-trip builds up
in everyone

00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:07.185
– even in among sahaja yogis, it does
build up.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.697
And they are all the time
on a different scene.

00:02:13.722 --> 00:02:22.992
This is like Hitler's style of behavior
that you pick up some sort of an issue.

00:02:23.017 --> 00:02:26.308
An issue could be anything, like they
are saying that

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:29.330
“we are trying to remove all the blind
faiths”. I mean,

00:02:29.355 --> 00:02:34.715
I've done this for eighteen years,
what can they do more than that?

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.147
And I have removed all your blind faiths
in all kinds of stupid things

00:02:38.172 --> 00:02:41.719
that the religion, so-called, was teaching
you.

00:02:41.744 --> 00:02:46.002
In every religion, there is no question
of only Hindu religion.

00:02:46.027 --> 00:02:48.628
But here they dare not say anything
about the Muslims

00:02:48.653 --> 00:02:51.460
because the Hindus are very mild people.

00:02:51.485 --> 00:02:55.306
They (the muslims) want that
all the temples must be removed,

00:02:55.331 --> 00:02:59.163
all the deities must be thrown away.

00:02:59.188 --> 00:03:05.410
This is all I think Rajneesh is their guru
because he made a...

00:03:06.797 --> 00:03:16.750
he made an exhibition where he tried
to show

00:03:16.775 --> 00:03:20.922
that Ganapati was something very funny
and all that.

00:03:20.947 --> 00:03:23.652
Now medically you know in Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:23.652 --> 00:03:28.895
that without Ganesha we cannot cure
many diseases. Is a fact.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.078
So a stupid fellow talking like that,
has become now the guru of these people

00:03:33.103 --> 00:03:36.651
who are discarded all over the world
and who have been insulted.

00:03:36.676 --> 00:03:41.856
So these few newspapers have made
him as a guru, perhaps that

00:03:41.881 --> 00:03:46.210
they are following his methods of saying
that we should be,

00:03:46.235 --> 00:03:49.713
we should be rid of all these ideas
and this and that.

00:03:49.738 --> 00:03:57.130
But they have gone to the extent that
all the spirituality is an illusion.

00:03:58.495 --> 00:04:02.710
It's such a joke. And that we should
give up

00:04:02.735 --> 00:04:09.531
all the, all readings and all understanding
about spirituality.

00:04:09.531 --> 00:04:14.093
But they do not know that their heritage
is spirituality.

00:04:14.118 --> 00:04:17.556
And the whole world depends on that.

00:04:17.581 --> 00:04:22.049
The whole world, because when the people
took to industrial development,

00:04:22.074 --> 00:04:25.224
you know how far they have gone
and how much they are lost.

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:29.062
And how far you were in that mess.
And how you came back

00:04:29.087 --> 00:04:31.844
because of Sahaja Yoga’s spirituality.

00:04:31.884 --> 00:04:39.652
Now if this nourishment from the roots
of spirituality

00:04:39.677 --> 00:04:44.511
does not reach the West, the real
knowledge, as it is in Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:44.536 --> 00:04:49.325
the West will be finished. West will be
finished, you know that very well.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.854
There is no joy, there is no love,
there is no poetry,

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:58.150
there is no music, there is no culture.

00:04:59.945 --> 00:05:06.130
But as you have understood that now
these people have now started

00:05:06.155 --> 00:05:09.046
talking about “no religion”
“no religion”,

00:05:09.071 --> 00:05:12.179
like many of your western countries
have also done,

00:05:12.204 --> 00:05:14.682
specially Russia has done that way,

00:05:14.707 --> 00:05:17.626
that there is nothing like God,
there is nothing like this and that.

00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:21.665
And now after all that now they
are coming to God.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.059
So now we’ll have to go through
another circle.

00:05:25.084 --> 00:05:28.654
But they are only hardly twenty people.

00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:35.092
So even one fellow who is like Hitler,
can destroy the whole thing.

00:05:35.117 --> 00:05:41.466
This is a very important thing - to destroy
something you need only one person.

00:05:41.491 --> 00:05:49.734
But to sustain and to construct
you need many people.

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:56.824
To drown a ship, you need only
one hole in it.

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:02.995
But to build the ship, you take months
together.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.177
So the work that is done for these
last eighteen years

00:06:07.202 --> 00:06:10.885
of Sahaja Yoga, is really tremendous.

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.085
And the truth about it, you know
for definite,

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:19.172
that it has helped so many people. Though
we have been going from ups and downs

00:06:19.197 --> 00:06:22.794
and all that, we've been doing wrong
things, no doubt about it,

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:29.273
but still, now we are quite established
and we know what Sahaja Yoga is.

00:06:29.298 --> 00:06:36.484
The experience of Sahaja Yoga you all
have had. We have seen so many,

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:40.510
(towards someone…) “What is she doing?
Please be seated”.

00:06:41.441 --> 00:06:46.016
Miraculous photographs you have seen,
so many miracles in your life day to day.

00:06:46.041 --> 00:06:51.239
Every day there are miracles. Now to say
there is no God

00:06:51.264 --> 00:06:55.205
is impossible for you because you have
felt the miracles

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:59.589
of this All-pervading Power,
the Paramchaitanya.

00:06:59.614 --> 00:07:03.035
And also all the religions are explained

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:08.570
and the complete integration of them
has been brought in.

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:14.033
But for that we have to know, as I told
you in Brahmapuri,

00:07:14.058 --> 00:07:18.506
that the sahaja yogis have to know that
they have to become dynamic.

00:07:18.531 --> 00:07:25.618
Whatever energies you have got, whatever
you have achieved within yourselves,

00:07:25.643 --> 00:07:30.718
is not sufficient enough. You have
to manifest.

00:07:30.743 --> 00:07:35.105
And in that dynamism, I think people
get lost.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.458
I have seen that some leaders become
horrid.

00:07:38.483 --> 00:07:43.268
I mean, sometimes their Vishuddhis could
be horrible, then their heart goes out.

00:07:43.304 --> 00:07:50.483
So you should not allow anybody (to be)
a leader for more than one month.

00:07:50.508 --> 00:07:55.685
It goes off. I have seen it. Because your
balloon has been already bloated

00:07:55.710 --> 00:08:01.361
and again it gets re-bloated in no time.
(speaking in Marathi…).

00:08:04.732 --> 00:08:11.466
They have religiously kept all the Indians
outside, I think. (speaking in Marathi…).

00:08:14.247 --> 00:08:17.397
I mean, he is the organizer here.

00:08:19.456 --> 00:08:22.723
(speaking Marathi)

00:08:25.278 --> 00:08:30.720
So the heritage of our country is
spirituality.

00:08:33.099 --> 00:08:37.260
And this is the nourishment.

00:08:37.285 --> 00:08:46.539
Only the one-sided growth in the West, due
to machinery or whatever you may call it,

00:08:47.407 --> 00:08:51.333
has ruined it completely.

00:08:51.358 --> 00:08:54.625
And one-sided growth in this country,
and all such countries,

00:08:54.650 --> 00:09:01.858
where religion has become a blind faith,
has also ruined it.

00:09:01.883 --> 00:09:06.646
But in the center lies Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:13.741
Now your wisdom, your sense,
is so apparent.

00:09:13.766 --> 00:09:19.517
I mean, people have been to all kinds
of gurus here and have been to everyone,

00:09:19.542 --> 00:09:23.988
but they don’t know anything about
anything. Except for remembering by heart

00:09:24.013 --> 00:09:28.384
- some these Hare Ramas, talk about,
“Rama” “Rama” – like that.

00:09:28.409 --> 00:09:31.339
While you know everything about Kundalini.
You know how to raise it.

00:09:31.364 --> 00:09:34.719
You know how to give Realization. You know
what are the diseases are caused,

00:09:34.744 --> 00:09:38.836
how to cure it and everything and
everything and everything.

00:09:38.861 --> 00:09:44.923
I mean, it has come to such a stage
that nobody asks Me any questions.

00:09:47.301 --> 00:09:51.014
Otherwise, in the beginning in London,
My lecture was for five minutes

00:09:51.039 --> 00:09:56.571
and the questions were for the rest
of the time.

00:09:56.596 --> 00:10:01.202
So now you know so much.

00:10:03.651 --> 00:10:10.006
And you accept which cannot be explained
also, because you know that.

00:10:10.031 --> 00:10:15.084
For example, somebody will ask Me,
“Mother, how do you get these photographs?”

00:10:15.109 --> 00:10:18.683
Why are we talking about it?

00:10:18.708 --> 00:10:25.330
I know how it happens, who is doing
this trick. But I don’t want to tell you.

00:10:28.526 --> 00:10:30.680
Moreover, if you demand something,
I’ll never tell you.

00:10:30.705 --> 00:10:32.917
That’s one of the characters I have.

00:10:32.942 --> 00:10:37.965
Ah, if you come with humble thing
and honest desire to know,

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:40.894
then I can tell you about everything,
that you want to know.

00:10:40.919 --> 00:10:43.911
But if you just want to force Me and say
that, “I challenge you”,

00:10:43.936 --> 00:10:46.829
I said, “I also challenge you.
Get out of here”.

00:10:46.854 --> 00:10:49.995
Like that. You see, it doesn’t react,
that way.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:56.248
So it is just the temperament
of the Divine

00:10:56.288 --> 00:11:03.212
that if you are convex, the Divine
becomes convex also,

00:11:03.237 --> 00:11:08.554
and fights and says, “No, get out”.
If you become concave,

00:11:08.579 --> 00:11:17.114
then it emits and gives knowledge,
or receives knowledge.

00:11:17.139 --> 00:11:23.105
So one has to be humble. That’s very
important part of it. One has to be humble.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:31.385
So the awareness, again I talk about
awareness,

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:36.457
within you should be that, how much
we have come to know about ourselves.

00:11:36.482 --> 00:11:39.936
How much we have to come to know
about others?

00:11:39.961 --> 00:11:47.555
How much we know about our own being?
How much we know about chakras?

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.421
In such a short time, how did we come
to know about it?

00:11:51.446 --> 00:11:55.470
Like we should know, if you are dealing
with a computer,

00:11:55.495 --> 00:12:02.729
and you know how computer works, how
it acts, how it is programmed, everything

00:12:02.754 --> 00:12:08.669
without programming it, without working
it out, without building it up.

00:12:08.694 --> 00:12:11.946
I mean, if you build it up, you know
how it works. But without doing that

00:12:11.971 --> 00:12:16.018
just to know a computer how it works,
and all the machinery about it,

00:12:16.043 --> 00:12:19.642
is a tremendous knowledge.

00:12:19.667 --> 00:12:23.319
And this is what has to be there
for all of us

00:12:23.344 --> 00:12:27.515
to know what we are there as human beings,
and what we have to do

00:12:27.642 --> 00:12:32.605
to emancipate the other human beings.

00:12:33.195 --> 00:12:37.620
Of course, I shouldn’t say that every
sahaja yogi is of that level, no.

00:12:37.645 --> 00:12:42.957
Or comes up, but everybody is trying.
Nobody has denied Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:42.982 --> 00:12:47.343
Nobody has said it’s not true. Everybody
is trying to get

00:12:47.368 --> 00:12:53.744
higher and higher in his state
of spirituality which doesn’t speak.

00:12:53.769 --> 00:13:00.367
It acts. It doesn’t manipulate. It acts.

00:13:00.392 --> 00:13:04.816
And we've seen it acts in so many
miraculous ways.

00:13:04.841 --> 00:13:10.434
So first to know about all these things,
after feeling that Paramchaitanya,

00:13:10.459 --> 00:13:14.711
is different from just to talk about it.

00:13:14.736 --> 00:13:18.817
Many have talked about it, but you have
never felt it.

00:13:18.842 --> 00:13:23.746
Now you have felt it, you have verified it,
you have experimented it.

00:13:23.771 --> 00:13:29.197
And you have found it that, this is
something absolutely real.

00:13:29.222 --> 00:13:37.661
In science, as Dr. Khan was telling Me,
that in science,

00:13:37.686 --> 00:13:44.335
the one theory which is established today
might be refuted tomorrow.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.873
Another theory that is established,
may be refuted.

00:13:48.898 --> 00:13:53.101
It goes on. So that no theory is
an absolute theory.

00:13:53.126 --> 00:13:57.899
But in Sahaja Yoga for the last eighteen
years, whatever I have been saying

00:13:57.924 --> 00:14:04.160
is the truth. And is absolute. It cannot
be challenged again.

00:14:04.185 --> 00:14:07.539
Nobody can say, “No, Mother,
it is not so”.

00:14:07.564 --> 00:14:12.993
A simple thing is, somebody comes to you
and you say, the other day it happened,

00:14:13.018 --> 00:14:19.481
one doctor was there in Aurangabad,
and he said that,

00:14:22.796 --> 00:14:28.023
“I have never had any guru”. But his left
Swadhistana…

00:14:28.048 --> 00:14:31.572
and he was looking very disturbed. He was
a sahaja yogi in a way,

00:14:31.597 --> 00:14:36.305
not looking normal. “I have pain
in the stomach,” and this and that.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:41.778
I asked him, “You had no guru?”,
he said, “No”. (speaking Marathi).

00:15:55.784 --> 00:16:00.904
So now as science has progressed
we can see clearly

00:16:00.929 --> 00:16:05.996
that it has not got the theory
which is absolute.

00:16:06.021 --> 00:16:11.873
But in Sahaja Yoga, as I told you,
there was a gentleman, a doctor,

00:16:11.898 --> 00:16:15.323
who was denying, he said, “I had no guru”.
I asked him, “Do you read books?”,

00:16:15.348 --> 00:16:21.613
“Yes – he said - I read Vivekananda”.
I said, “That’s it”.

00:16:21.638 --> 00:16:25.345
He said he was reading the book
of a particular guru.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:30.855
We gave a bandhan to that guru
and this fellow felt alright.

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:37.569
There are so many things one has to know
about.

00:16:37.594 --> 00:16:45.279
Little, little things are there, which must
be understood in Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:45.304 --> 00:16:51.959
And one should do it according to them,
because it is for your benevolence.

00:16:51.984 --> 00:16:59.752
Now supposing I say, “Just do these
things”. If you don’t accept Me,

00:16:59.777 --> 00:17:03.429
why am I telling you? I am not telling you
because I have to gain anything.

00:17:03.454 --> 00:17:08.777
But is for your good. Now if you don’t
want to accept me or if you react,

00:17:08.802 --> 00:17:12.785
is not going to help you. Sahaja Yoga
is not for Me, is for you.

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:17.014
Now if you are, truthfully, honestly,
if you are seekers,

00:17:17.039 --> 00:17:22.254
then you must know that "My aim
is to rise spiritually".

00:17:22.279 --> 00:17:24.955
Now in science you have risen quite a lot,
you are fed up with it.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.974
Now you’re back into spirituality

00:17:27.999 --> 00:17:31.747
and for spirituality you have to be
a subtler person.

00:17:31.773 --> 00:17:36.119
And for these subtleties you have
to give up all your conditionings.

00:17:36.144 --> 00:17:40.077
All funny conditionings are to be given
and the worst that you have,

00:17:40.102 --> 00:17:46.132
is the ego part. It just jumps up. I have
seen that appointing people leaders

00:17:46.165 --> 00:17:51.130
has been the greatest harmful thing
I have done to them.

00:17:51.155 --> 00:17:55.379
So many of them just got lost, because
they became leaders.

00:17:55.404 --> 00:18:00.348
I mean, a kind of a Hitler, enters
into them.

00:18:00.373 --> 00:18:03.597
So this is one of the worst conditionings
we have.

00:18:03.622 --> 00:18:10.289
We have to be very careful that we don’t
try to assert our ego on others.

00:18:10.314 --> 00:18:13.783
When we become leaders or a some position
is given to us,

00:18:13.808 --> 00:18:22.890
or ask something is to be achieved
through your authority.

00:18:22.915 --> 00:18:25.757
Only we have the authority of God.

00:18:25.782 --> 00:18:32.185
Unless and until we become humble
like that, nothing is going to flow.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:39.113
You can see that, that the sea lies
the lowest in height.

00:18:39.138 --> 00:18:43.256
And all the rivers and everything flows
to the sea.

00:18:43.281 --> 00:18:47.729
And from the sea only rises the rain.

00:18:47.754 --> 00:18:53.293
Supposing sea was somewhere on top
of Himalayas,

00:18:53.318 --> 00:19:03.763
we would have been all living
in the Sahara desert.

00:19:04.569 --> 00:19:10.445
Is a very simple thing, is to be humble
- that’s first sign - is to be humble,

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:19.412
is to be non-violent, because we depend
on the All-pervading Power.

00:19:19.437 --> 00:19:24.418
It is a power which is completely
integrated within us.

00:19:24.443 --> 00:19:30.985
Only we are not the ones, we want
to be aware of it.

00:19:31.665 --> 00:19:36.428
So this ignorance, this blindness,
if it disappears from us,

00:19:36.461 --> 00:19:41.574
that Divine Power will manifest.

00:19:41.599 --> 00:19:46.811
But our styles are so complicated.

00:19:46.836 --> 00:19:50.565
Sometimes I just don’t understand,

00:19:51.163 --> 00:19:56.728
why we have complicated ourselves
so much.

00:19:56.753 --> 00:20:03.350
I mean, look at the flowers, look at
the leaves; they are on a tree, supposing.

00:20:03.375 --> 00:20:09.629
Automatically they will open out
to the sun. Automatically.

00:20:09.654 --> 00:20:13.067
You don’t have to take a leaf towards
the sun, not at all.

00:20:13.092 --> 00:20:15.871
Automatically it opens out. You have
seen it every day.

00:20:15.896 --> 00:20:19.129
Automatically. Because it requires sun.

00:20:19.154 --> 00:20:25.366
Now you want to have spirit in yourself.
You want to get to spirit.

00:20:25.391 --> 00:20:30.552
So automatically you should, really
automatically, if that is your desire,

00:20:30.577 --> 00:20:38.592
you should, with your own desire only,
should get to the light of the spirit.

00:20:38.617 --> 00:20:46.339
And should grow in that spirit to know
that this is what you have to achieve.

00:20:48.825 --> 00:20:52.329
But small things disturb you,

00:20:52.354 --> 00:20:56.711
like somebody doesn’t get married. Next
day you see the face of that person,

00:20:56.736 --> 00:21:01.833
as if somebody has died in the family
he is sitting there.

00:21:01.861 --> 00:21:08.876
Really, I have seen it. Immediately I make
out who has not been yet engaged.

00:21:11.197 --> 00:21:15.852
Then after marriage I find again
the same sort of nonsense.

00:21:15.877 --> 00:21:21.204
Because they are analyzing, “I want
this kind, I want that kind. I want”.

00:21:21.229 --> 00:21:26.435
I mean, whatever is available here
is available.

00:21:30.629 --> 00:21:36.583
Like on the ship, you don’t have any
problems, because you have no solutions.

00:21:36.608 --> 00:21:39.026
If you are moving on a ship and you
just ask for something,

00:21:39.051 --> 00:21:43.266
“Oh no, not available here,” finished.

00:21:46.905 --> 00:21:51.244
But then you lose all the fun of Sahaja
Yoga for a small little nonsensical thing.

00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:56.905
If not this, next year. What is
so important?

00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:03.357
I mean, certain there are limitations
of age, height, this, that.

00:22:03.382 --> 00:22:08.205
Then even if you arrange their marriages,
is very interesting,

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:11.060
then they come and tell you, “No, no,
I would not like to marry this girl”.

00:22:11.085 --> 00:22:14.058
Why? “Because I want such and such”.
All right, then we find.

00:22:14.083 --> 00:22:16.995
“No, no, no, she is no good. She has
these things,” so move that.

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:21.583
I mean this is not the way. You are not
here to choose a girl for yourself.

00:22:21.608 --> 00:22:25.431
Then there is another one who can say,
“All right, I came down, I saw one girl

00:22:25.456 --> 00:22:32.369
and fell in love”. So you fall in love
and get out. This nonsense going on.

00:22:32.394 --> 00:22:39.202
See, you must have certain amount
of dignity. You are all sahaja yogis.

00:22:39.234 --> 00:22:42.304
And when I see all this kind
of stupid attitude,

00:22:42.329 --> 00:22:47.744
I say these people can never gain
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:48.709 --> 00:22:54.433
In India you will be surprised. I mean,

00:22:55.171 --> 00:22:59.953
even I was married to a man who was
from another, another place.

00:22:59.978 --> 00:23:04.652
Absolutely different country, different
religion, different everything.

00:23:04.677 --> 00:23:06.810
And a different person.

00:23:06.835 --> 00:23:11.268
So one can say that it was a very
unconventional marriage, one can say.

00:23:11.293 --> 00:23:17.171
But I would never touch this man
or he would never touch me.

00:23:17.196 --> 00:23:21.863
And if he would talk to me,
in the presence of others only.

00:23:23.184 --> 00:23:28.224
And despite that, our marriage is very
strong and we are very happy couple.

00:23:28.249 --> 00:23:31.008
With all these nonsense you go on doing,
bringing it to the level

00:23:31.033 --> 00:23:34.753
of physical appearances, physical
understanding, your ego,

00:23:34.778 --> 00:23:40.354
“I want this, I want that”, you find that
just after the marriage you get off.

00:23:40.379 --> 00:23:43.406
You start analyzing. That’s why
I am telling you today.

00:23:43.431 --> 00:23:48.982
I may not able to talk to you about
marriages later on. That be careful.

00:23:49.007 --> 00:23:53.240
And that’s how you have brought
problems to Me.

00:23:54.523 --> 00:23:58.484
You see, once you accept that in Sahaja
Yoga you are going to marry,

00:23:58.509 --> 00:24:02.473
then you must accept that Sahaja Yoga
has its own norms and styles

00:24:02.498 --> 00:24:07.447
by which it will marry you and will look
after your marriage and will bless you.

00:24:07.472 --> 00:24:12.040
But if you start analyzing
and misbehaving,

00:24:12.065 --> 00:24:16.084
it’s not going to work out, and you
will have lots of problems.

00:24:16.109 --> 00:24:23.570
Either you believe in the All-pervading
Power and surrender your ego to it,

00:24:23.595 --> 00:24:28.081
or else you have your ego.

00:24:30.676 --> 00:24:35.349
Sahaja Yoga is decided by Me,
by Paramchaitanya.

00:24:35.374 --> 00:24:42.870
Now sometimes in Sahaja Yoga it may
happen that, maybe, it may not work out.

00:24:42.895 --> 00:24:51.376
But invariably I have seen, invariably,
is none of My faults. None of My faults.

00:24:51.401 --> 00:24:54.925
Mostly the leaders have given wrong
information,

00:24:54.950 --> 00:25:00.061
mostly the leaders didn’t talk about
the, about the background.

00:25:00.086 --> 00:25:10.378
Or maybe that there has been some sort
of an ego-trip with the people,

00:25:10.403 --> 00:25:14.830
and they are the ones who are creating
problems for us.

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:20.798
But things work out. Slowly, gradually
we can improve. We must have patience.

00:25:20.823 --> 00:25:25.053
If only on first day you start demanding
something doing that,

00:25:25.078 --> 00:25:28.651
it’s not going to work out.

00:25:29.902 --> 00:25:35.555
We must learn to give, in marriage
it’s an adjustment of giving.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:39.899
It is no adjustment of demand.

00:25:40.532 --> 00:25:44.995
We have to give. We have to sacrifice.

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:49.960
What is there with you to sacrifice is
all these rubbish things.

00:25:49.985 --> 00:25:54.103
Your spirit you cannot sacrifice,
so you keep to your spirit.

00:25:54.128 --> 00:25:57.816
And live with it. What is you going
to sacrifice?

00:25:57.841 --> 00:26:01.600
I mean, what do you have to give?

00:26:02.468 --> 00:26:06.435
And then only you will enjoy.

00:26:07.483 --> 00:26:15.416
Then only you will enjoy the spirit.
I am getting cool breeze from you.

00:26:17.191 --> 00:26:25.384
So I want you to be very great sahaja
yogis, very great.

00:26:25.409 --> 00:26:31.974
And you should really manifest
your powers of wisdom.

00:26:31.999 --> 00:26:35.281
Now men have ego part and women
have another side,

00:26:35.306 --> 00:26:39.479
is that they are very dull sometimes.
Extremely dull.

00:26:39.504 --> 00:26:45.461
They don’t think they have to play a very
dynamic role, while they are the shaktis.

00:26:45.486 --> 00:26:50.564
Like they will not even clap hands,
they will not even have their torches

00:26:50.589 --> 00:26:56.974
to see what’s happening. Nothing. They just
think they are just a, sort of parasites.

00:26:56.999 --> 00:27:02.299
Just coming here as wives or sisters,
or whatever it is, wearing saris.

00:27:02.324 --> 00:27:06.612
No, you have to be extremely dynamic.

00:27:06.637 --> 00:27:10.471
You must know all about Sahaja Yoga.
You must know all about chakras.

00:27:10.496 --> 00:27:15.116
You should know everything. In India,
when in the ancient times,

00:27:15.141 --> 00:27:18.737
they used to teach them about God,
religion and all that.

00:27:18.762 --> 00:27:23.480
So many great ladies we had, Gargi
and Maitreyi and all those,

00:27:23.505 --> 00:27:27.089
who were very learned women.

00:27:27.114 --> 00:27:32.924
So in no way you should be just women who
do not know anything of Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:32.949 --> 00:27:36.782
Sahaja Yoga is not only meant for men;
it’s meant for you, much more for you.

00:27:36.807 --> 00:27:42.112
Because you are shakti and I am your
Mother. So I find the women lack that.

00:27:42.137 --> 00:27:45.928
They are more worried about the saris,
the this and that, and I mean,

00:27:45.953 --> 00:27:52.180
now from the hair-dressing they have
come to saris. That’s what I feel.

00:27:53.462 --> 00:27:56.831
Well, it’s just the same.

00:27:58.951 --> 00:28:02.252
Of course sari is a very good dress.
It’s nice to wear.

00:28:02.277 --> 00:28:05.862
By that we give lot of encouragement
to our weavers in India.

00:28:05.887 --> 00:28:09.892
It’s very artistic, and good that
represents also

00:28:09.917 --> 00:28:16.060
a very lady-like feminine thing. But that
doesn’t mean you should become so feminine

00:28:16.085 --> 00:28:20.280
that you don’t understand Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:20.305 --> 00:28:27.259
I have seen women don’t know where
the centers are of the feet.

00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:33.915
Indian women know. Men do know….
Indian women know,

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:38.707
but the Western women don’t know,
so many of them.

00:28:38.732 --> 00:28:42.040
They don’t know about chakras. They don’t
know how to raise the Kundalini.

00:28:42.065 --> 00:28:44.339
They don’t know what’s the problem is.

00:28:44.364 --> 00:28:47.860
So once you have left that life, where
you are wearing a sari,

00:28:47.885 --> 00:28:52.890
doesn’t mean now that you have become
a woman in the gosha.

00:28:52.915 --> 00:28:56.962
Gosha is the one where they have to wear
chadar; chadar, they call it.

00:28:56.987 --> 00:29:02.022
No, sari means you can also be
very dynamic.

00:29:02.047 --> 00:29:06.610
The same sari that you are wearing,
even the saris of the nine yards,

00:29:06.635 --> 00:29:10.902
we have had queens who fought
the English.

00:29:10.927 --> 00:29:15.330
You have must heard about Jhansi Ki Rani.
She was hardly of any age.

00:29:15.355 --> 00:29:20.152
She jumped from eighty feet height with
her child behind her. She was a widow.

00:29:20.177 --> 00:29:25.932
And she fought the English. Left and right.
And when she was killed,

00:29:25.957 --> 00:29:32.151
the person who was here, the Englishman,
he said, the governor,

00:29:32.176 --> 00:29:38.796
he said, “We have won the war but
the glory goes to Jhansi ki Rani.”

00:29:39.977 --> 00:29:46.238
Then we had another one, Chand-bibi,
another lady, in a ...

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:55.992
Ahmednagar; she fought. We had
so many women like that.

00:29:56.017 --> 00:30:00.670
Tremendous type of women we had,
though they lived like women.

00:30:00.695 --> 00:30:07.939
We had Padmini, we had Noorjahan,
we had Ahilyabai, so many women.

00:30:07.964 --> 00:30:12.625
They were not manly at all.
Very woman-like.

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:17.867
There was the last one was Shivaji’s,
Shivaji’s daughter-in-law.

00:30:17.892 --> 00:30:20.707
She was only seventeen years of age,
seventeen years.

00:30:20.732 --> 00:30:25.026
And she fought this Aurangzeb and she
is the one who defeated him.

00:30:25.051 --> 00:30:29.166
Nobody could manage this Aurangzeb
horrible fellow, she defeated him.

00:30:29.191 --> 00:30:34.544
So though, you see, the Indian women look
so docile and simple,

00:30:34.569 --> 00:30:43.070
but when it comes to their personality,
they are capable of tremendous things.

00:30:46.563 --> 00:30:52.914
So this character when you are wearing
the saris you must also know how to tie up

00:30:52.939 --> 00:30:57.197
the backside and to fight.

00:30:59.254 --> 00:31:04.818
Otherwise you have not got the Sahaj
culture in you.

00:31:04.843 --> 00:31:11.999
Either you are very dominating or you are
so docile like cabbages.

00:31:12.024 --> 00:31:19.752
You must understand that we have
to be alert, very alert.

00:31:19.777 --> 00:31:23.828
And Mother depends on us. On our own
personalities,

00:31:23.853 --> 00:31:28.222
that the way we are going to develop
ourselves, our children, our husbands,

00:31:28.247 --> 00:31:32.127
our society of Sahaja Yoga, the whole
of Vishwa Nirmal Dharma.

00:31:32.152 --> 00:31:36.744
Is the woman who makes the society.

00:31:37.361 --> 00:31:46.655
The whole universe is in the hands
of a woman who creates children.

00:31:47.617 --> 00:31:53.390
So the stupid ideas of romanticism
and all this nonsense,

00:31:53.415 --> 00:31:56.577
has to be finished. The possession
of husband –

00:31:56.602 --> 00:32:00.830
“What time you came,” “When did you go,”
“Where did you go,”

00:32:00.855 --> 00:32:04.696
and here the women when Shivaji
started his fight

00:32:04.721 --> 00:32:11.633
they used to cut their finger, thumb,
and used to put the tika

00:32:11.658 --> 00:32:14.854
on the forehead of the husbands who
were going in the war

00:32:14.879 --> 00:32:19.694
and they said, “Don’t come showing
your back”.

00:32:21.914 --> 00:32:24.733
Such great women we have had
in this Maharashtra,

00:32:24.758 --> 00:32:27.870
where you find them to be so mild.

00:32:27.895 --> 00:32:32.883
If it comes to their country, if it comes
to their own personality,

00:32:32.908 --> 00:32:39.749
to their own chastity or anything, they are
tremendous. Just like lionesses.

00:32:39.781 --> 00:32:43.643
So with this sari lots of things go
hand in hand.

00:32:43.668 --> 00:32:46.991
Is not only the sari you are wearing,
but you are representing

00:32:47.016 --> 00:32:52.402
something very dynamic within
yourself.

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:58.919
Now when we talk about our further
programs

00:32:58.944 --> 00:33:03.390
people are insisting that we should have
a program in any case in Kolhapur.

00:33:03.415 --> 00:33:05.853
But I told them I’ll not allow sahaja yogis
to go there

00:33:05.878 --> 00:33:10.711
because they were hurt so badly. But some
of you can come, not all of you.

00:33:10.736 --> 00:33:13.889
I would be rather worried. I don’t think
anybody will hurt you

00:33:13.914 --> 00:33:16.785
and they are saying they will make
arrangements.

00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:22.888
So if you want to come, if you are
not afraid...

00:33:38.034 --> 00:33:43.457
But on one promise. That nobody is going
to beat anyone.

00:33:43.482 --> 00:33:46.799
I am saying, “Don’t beat. Don’t beat”
and somebody heard, “Beat”.

00:33:46.824 --> 00:33:51.742
I mean, I mean, I have never heard such
sort of thing, when I am saying

00:33:51.767 --> 00:33:55.113
on the thing that, “Don’t beat.
Don’t beat,”

00:33:55.138 --> 00:33:59.078
then somebody hears that, “Beat them.
Beat them”.

00:33:59.892 --> 00:34:03.506
I just don’t understand how can
(that be).

00:34:03.531 --> 00:34:09.482
So you don’t have to, really, you don’t
have to beat anyone.

00:34:09.507 --> 00:34:12.797
There is no need. You know that
there is Paramchaitanya working.

00:34:12.822 --> 00:34:17.775
All this is also the work
of Paramchaitanya. In the afternoon,

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:21.901
Yogi Mahajan was discussing with Me
very seriously like a lawyer,

00:34:21.926 --> 00:34:26.032
saying that, “Mother we cannot form
a criminal case on them,

00:34:26.057 --> 00:34:33.746
because there is no evidence”. Afternoon.
And in the evening we have evidence now.

00:34:43.776 --> 00:34:48.263
And then they are writing in the other way
round, that they were beaten up

00:34:48.295 --> 00:34:52.905
and that you threw stones at them.
And none of them were injured.

00:34:52.930 --> 00:34:57.308
They must have been vibrated stones,
I think.

00:35:00.746 --> 00:35:06.677
How can you? They had no injuries. They
wrote it down they've no injuries.

00:35:06.702 --> 00:35:09.967
So there is no need for you to bother
about it.

00:35:09.992 --> 00:35:14.739
With all that there were at least more
than four hundred stones that came

00:35:14.764 --> 00:35:20.651
and only eighteen people got hurt. And
really seriously, I think, one or two.

00:35:20.676 --> 00:35:25.955
So there is nothing and I can cure
all of you, [you] know that very well.

00:35:38.188 --> 00:35:41.574
On the whole, you see this country,
especially Maharashtra,

00:35:41.599 --> 00:35:45.540
is so full of devotion to God.

00:35:45.565 --> 00:35:48.930
Like these things are not going to work
out. But they are very dangerous people

00:35:48.955 --> 00:35:55.091
like Hitler, you see, they start moving
about and giving some ideas and all that.

00:35:55.116 --> 00:35:59.252
So it is better to finish them at the time
when they are just prospering,

00:35:59.277 --> 00:36:04.018
as they call themselves Nirmulan,
is to remove the roots.

00:36:04.043 --> 00:36:09.264
So we have to do the Nirmulan
of Nirmulan.

00:36:09.289 --> 00:36:13.634
All right. So now today we'll have
the puja.

00:36:13.659 --> 00:36:21.717
Then after that if you want you can go
to Kolhapur for your purchase.

00:36:21.742 --> 00:36:25.558
But it starts, the shops starts quite late
and will keep quite late till eight

00:36:25.583 --> 00:36:30.628
and tomorrow the whole day is available
for you. So you can take your buses.

00:36:30.653 --> 00:36:36.038
You can go down there, and you can have
your purchase and all that,

00:36:36.063 --> 00:36:39.564
then come back here. Tomorrow also
you can do the same.

00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:45.699
Day after tomorrow, our Mr. Govind has
very kindly invited you all to his place,

00:36:45.724 --> 00:36:50.910
as it is he is an extremely generous man.
So,

00:37:02.015 --> 00:37:04.435
and when I told him that, “You must
take money from Me”,

00:37:04.476 --> 00:37:07.136
he was just fighting with Me, “Mother,
give me this first chance.

00:37:07.161 --> 00:37:12.559
This is my great honor that…(speaking
Marathi and Hindi to someone)

00:37:16.679 --> 00:37:21.587
So… Let them come, if they want to come.”

00:37:28.614 --> 00:37:32.196
So then the program is that day
after tomorrow,

00:37:32.221 --> 00:37:37.179
after this thing he says it will be over
by 12:30 or one′o clock.

00:37:37.204 --> 00:37:41.581
So you will have tonight and tomorrow
full day for your shopping.

00:37:41.606 --> 00:37:45.123
But I think then you should not bother
more about shopping.

00:37:45.148 --> 00:37:47.705
Whatever you have to do, better finish
tomorrow.

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:50.663
And then you have to come
to the program also.

00:37:50.688 --> 00:37:54.441
Day after if you linger on then it will
be very difficult.

00:37:54.466 --> 00:38:00.316
So all of you should go there, have your
food, and then go to Ganapatipule.

00:38:00.341 --> 00:38:04.371
This is the program. So you reach
Ganapatipule in the evening.

00:38:04.396 --> 00:38:06.912
I hope it’s all clear to you.

00:38:06.937 --> 00:38:10.897
And whatever you want to buy, you have
to buy here. But I would say

00:38:10.922 --> 00:38:15.363
that some of you are really, really
do not know what is real silk is.

00:38:15.388 --> 00:38:18.420
And I've seen some people buying
something horrid.

00:38:18.445 --> 00:38:22.337
And very thin silk you should not buy
because it will last only for eight days.

00:38:22.362 --> 00:38:25.418
And then it will be finished. So don’t go
for cheap things.

00:38:25.443 --> 00:38:30.644
One sari which is good sari, silk sari,
is better than ten bad saris.

00:38:30.669 --> 00:38:35.022
Luckily now we have some saris that you
wanted for, the printed saris

00:38:35.047 --> 00:38:39.875
which I can give you in Ganapatipule.
Nice printed saris,

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:47.055
of the tassar and also silk. We’ll have
them there. You can all buy, there.

00:38:48.486 --> 00:38:51.045
Anything else?

00:38:51.624 --> 00:38:57.553
Because I don’t think I’ll meet you any
more perhaps till we go to Ganapatipule.

00:38:57.578 --> 00:39:02.805
Now also if you could get those
bhajan things, please buy.

00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:06.656
I have given you presents twice. But you
never bring them on your tour

00:39:06.681 --> 00:39:12.226
and this time again, I don’t want to get
this kind of a thing. (Hindi).

00:39:12.251 --> 00:39:19.260
Just show them. Anything of this kind,
please get it. Is very important.

00:39:19.285 --> 00:39:24.686
I have given you twice as presents
but it’s very difficult every time

00:39:24.711 --> 00:39:30.887
to go to the shop and get it for you.
If you can get them please buy.

00:39:30.912 --> 00:39:37.101
Some of you should at least have them.
(speaking marathi to someone)

00:39:45.453 --> 00:39:49.538
He will organize, you better purchase.

00:39:56.218 --> 00:40:02.556
Now all the marriages practically have
been decided. One or two are left,

00:40:02.581 --> 00:40:07.833
which he has also adjusted. Now those who
were over age or something like that,

00:40:07.858 --> 00:40:10.428
we could not arrange their marriages.
Doesn’t matter.

00:40:10.453 --> 00:40:13.194
It may work out, it may not work out.
Doesn’t matter.

00:40:13.219 --> 00:40:17.570
After all, you are in Sahaja Yoga. I mean,
you are really married to Sahaja Yoga,

00:40:17.595 --> 00:40:22.085
that’s all. This is something sideways,
you see.

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:25.398
So don’t make very, your life
miserable,

00:40:25.423 --> 00:40:28.920
so all the way you have come, to know
that you are not ...

00:40:28.945 --> 00:40:33.139
we have not been able to arrange
your marriage. It’s not proper.

00:40:33.164 --> 00:40:36.920
Just enjoy. Don’t miss the point.

00:40:36.945 --> 00:40:40.226
May God bless you.
