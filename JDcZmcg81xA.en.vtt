00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.666
And all the worries of your
families should be brought to Mother.

00:00:13.746 --> 00:00:18.225
Simple thing like pregnancy or sneezing,

00:00:18.305 --> 00:00:23.418
very simple things - which are so natural

00:00:23.498 --> 00:00:30.458
are brought into your attention.

00:00:31.705 --> 00:00:34.065
So when you have them in your attention I say:

00:00:34.145 --> 00:00:39.505
'All right, go ahead with it.
Try to solve it, if possible.'

00:00:39.585 --> 00:00:42.265
But if you do not have them in your attention

00:00:42.345 --> 00:00:46.265
they are in My attention.

00:00:48.457 --> 00:00:52.844
You leave them in My attention, I'll manage that.

00:00:52.924 --> 00:00:57.779
You should have only one
intense desire within yourself:

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.778
"Have I become the spirit?

00:01:01.858 --> 00:01:05.738
Have I achieved my ultimate?

00:01:05.818 --> 00:01:10.618
Have I risen above the worldly desires?"

00:01:10.698 --> 00:01:13.698
Purify it.

00:01:15.978 --> 00:01:19.578
Once you start purifying whatever falls off,

00:01:19.658 --> 00:01:22.778
I'll look after that.

00:01:22.858 --> 00:01:28.778
This is just an assurance, but not a guarantee.

00:01:30.338 --> 00:01:38.058
If it deserves My attention I
will definitely look after you.

00:01:38.138 --> 00:01:46.458
You have to value your
attention as I value My attention.

00:01:49.138 --> 00:01:54.898
I think you have to value much more of your attention

00:01:55.938 --> 00:02:00.738
than Me, because I can manage,

00:02:00.818 --> 00:02:02.538
many more things within Myself,

00:02:02.618 --> 00:02:08.938
because everything is in My attention.

00:02:09.018 --> 00:02:14.058
But you try to purify your desires,

00:02:14.138 --> 00:02:19.138
away from the worldly problems that are facing you.

00:02:23.383 --> 00:02:28.261
Now how do you practice this detachment?

00:02:28.341 --> 00:02:31.541
Because we get attached to
something, of course, through our brain,

00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:34.421
but through our attention.

00:02:34.501 --> 00:02:41.541
So we try to do what we call Chitta Nirodh,

00:02:41.621 --> 00:02:45.461
is to control your attention: where is it going?

00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:50.541
In the practice of Sahaja
Yoga, if you have to rise higher,

00:02:50.621 --> 00:02:55.261
you have to improve your own
instrument, and not the instrument of others.

00:02:55.341 --> 00:03:00.341
This is one thing one should know, for definite.

00:03:00.421 --> 00:03:05.661
Now, you just watch your attention,
where is it going. Watch yourself.

00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:10.501
As soon as you’ll start watching
yourself, your attention, you’ll become

00:03:10.581 --> 00:03:14.061
more identified with your Spirit. Because
if you have to watch your attention,

00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:18.781
you have to be your Spirit,
otherwise how will you watch it?

00:03:18.861 --> 00:03:22.781
So, now, see where is your attention going.

00:03:24.261 --> 00:03:31.464
First, the attachment is, in
all gross ways, to your body.

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:41.182
So what you can do is at least to
watch your attention, you can do that.

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:46.662
You can watch your attention very clearly

00:03:48.102 --> 00:03:53.182
by seeing where your attention is going.

00:03:55.302 --> 00:04:00.062
And then, controlling your attention, also, you can do.

00:04:00.142 --> 00:04:02.702
Very simple:

00:04:05.302 --> 00:04:08.862
to control your attention

00:04:08.942 --> 00:04:15.342
you have to just remove
your attention from this to that.

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:19.822
Try to change your priorities.

00:04:19.902 --> 00:04:25.550
All this has to be done now, after
Realization - a complete detachment.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.510
Where is your attention is, you see.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:39.150
That your human attention is hopelessly
bad. Very entangled nonsense it is.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.710
"We did this because of this." There is an explanation.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.110
Or others have to give an
explanation. No explanation is needed

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.711
to be given, or to be accepted,
or to be asked for. No explanation.

00:04:55.791 --> 00:04:59.919
To exist without explanation is the best way.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.640
First is to find out about yourself:
where does your attention go?

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:22.560
What makes you feel like looking
after or concerned for attention?

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.560
You see, the attention comes from various problems,

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:38.040
and could be your upbringing
where you are not controlled,

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:52.360
could be your education, could be
your atmosphere in which you live

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.584
or could be your own ego or your conditioning.

00:05:56.664 --> 00:06:05.063
So, this attention is being attacked

00:06:05.143 --> 00:06:17.023
by all these outside energies or negative forces

00:06:17.103 --> 00:06:24.463
and it gets entangled - like a river flowing

00:06:24.543 --> 00:06:33.823
straight into the ocean can get lost in a barren place.

00:06:33.903 --> 00:06:43.743
In the same way this attention,
which has to go towards the Divine,

00:06:43.823 --> 00:06:48.023
gets frittered away and is vanished...

00:06:48.103 --> 00:06:54.543
This weak attention cannot take you towards the Divine.

00:06:54.623 --> 00:07:01.983
Ultimately you find that all
this attention is being completely

00:07:02.063 --> 00:07:09.223
absorbed or frittered away by
the nonsense that’s going on.

00:07:09.303 --> 00:07:14.903
Unfortunately or fortunately, you
are born in these modern times,

00:07:14.983 --> 00:07:20.263
and in these modern times, as you
know, it's a very chaotic condition.

00:07:20.343 --> 00:07:25.463
In these chaotic conditions, you don’t
know what is right and what is wrong.

00:07:25.543 --> 00:07:31.023
And there are all kinds of attractions,

00:07:31.103 --> 00:07:40.023
which can take away your attention
and reduce the energy of your attention.

00:07:41.143 --> 00:07:48.823
It is possible more for the
people who are very right-sided.

00:07:48.903 --> 00:07:52.783
Also the left-sided people can be very much affected.

00:07:52.863 --> 00:07:58.583
Right-sided people, as you know, go
up to a point and become extremely dry,

00:07:58.663 --> 00:08:06.183
self-opinionated and aggressive.
All their attention is in aggression,

00:08:06.263 --> 00:08:12.463
while the people who are on
the left side are indulging too much

00:08:12.543 --> 00:08:20.063
into their own whims and their
desires and their own temptations.

00:08:20.143 --> 00:08:24.423
Both sides can fritter away your attention

00:08:24.503 --> 00:08:31.383
which is the most important thing. It is
the most valuable thing is your attention.

00:08:31.463 --> 00:08:36.223
But the attention cannot be controlled by a person

00:08:36.303 --> 00:08:42.975
who doesn't have a weak mind or a weak heart.

00:08:44.015 --> 00:08:49.535
We have to understand that we have
now come to the realm of the Divinity.

00:08:49.615 --> 00:08:54.615
We are in the Kingdom of God and we are divine people.

00:08:54.695 --> 00:08:59.135
We are very powerful people, but if we fritter away

00:08:59.215 --> 00:09:03.095
our attention, we become very, very weak people.

00:09:03.175 --> 00:09:09.095
It's easy to feel that, “we are
Sahaja Yogis”, “we have done

00:09:09.175 --> 00:09:15.375
so much of realisation of others” or
“we have helped so many people.”

00:09:15.455 --> 00:09:19.415
All this consciousness if it
comes within you, then know

00:09:19.495 --> 00:09:23.775
that you are still not fully developed Sahaja Yogis.

00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:29.855
There should be no consciousness of what
you are doing or what you are committing.

00:09:29.935 --> 00:09:38.135
There is no need to boast about
it. There is no need to advertise it.

00:09:38.215 --> 00:09:42.655
Whatever you are, is already, can be seen by everyone.

00:09:42.735 --> 00:09:46.615
But even that desire is not needed

00:09:46.695 --> 00:09:51.093
because you are doing just
for the satisfaction of your Spirit.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.856
And the Agnya chakra is nothing but your attention.

00:09:58.936 --> 00:10:07.319
If your attention is all the time roaming
about paying attention to 1001 thing,

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:14.526
then you cannot develop that concentrated
penetration of your attention into things

00:10:14.606 --> 00:10:21.107
and whatever you do is very
superficial. It’s not joy giving.

00:10:21.187 --> 00:10:29.018
That depth can only be possible if your
attention is on the Spirit and not on frivolous things.

00:10:29.098 --> 00:10:33.503
Because of that you’ll become
thoughtlessly aware when you’ll be enjoying.

00:10:33.583 --> 00:10:42.453
And that whatever you’ll do it will be
very genuine, it will not have artificiality.

00:10:42.533 --> 00:10:45.495
And now in Sahaja Yoga penance is not food,

00:10:45.575 --> 00:10:51.992
is not other useless things but what is the
most important is to control your attention.

00:10:52.072 --> 00:10:59.171
Where does it go? Does it go to your worries,
to your troubles, to your past, to this, to others?

00:10:59.251 --> 00:11:03.432
Or does it go to your Spirit?

00:11:03.512 --> 00:11:08.985
This is important to see that
your attention is on your Spirit.

00:11:09.065 --> 00:11:16.433
If your attention is on you Spirit, then you get that
depth, that genuiness in your relationship with others.

00:11:16.513 --> 00:11:19.548
So one has to do introspection.

00:11:19.628 --> 00:11:28.457
And that introspection is the
one in which you watch yourself.

00:11:28.537 --> 00:11:34.715
Not condemn but watch, just watch – ‘what am I doing?’

00:11:34.795 --> 00:11:38.998
And this is such a precious
time, such an important time

00:11:39.078 --> 00:11:44.058
– to know your worth and to know your value.

00:11:44.138 --> 00:11:48.605
That you should not waste any
time any longer into anything else

00:11:48.685 --> 00:11:54.055
but try to touch your depths through introspection.

00:11:54.135 --> 00:12:01.474
‘Why am I doing this?’ ‘What is my life worth?’

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:04.913
‘I am a Sahaja Yogi and why I should do?’

00:12:09.207 --> 00:12:13.687
And now you have to become

00:12:13.767 --> 00:12:17.767
absolutely thoughtless

00:12:17.847 --> 00:12:20.727
after this puja.

00:12:20.807 --> 00:12:26.367
If that happens, I think we have achieved a lot.

00:12:26.447 --> 00:12:31.167
That’s the biggest blessing that Christ has given you,

00:12:31.247 --> 00:12:35.087
which you should really enjoy.

00:12:36.367 --> 00:12:43.007
Then only this Akash Tattwa in you will work.

00:12:43.087 --> 00:12:45.727
And how it works?

00:12:46.927 --> 00:12:49.967
Through your attention,

00:12:50.047 --> 00:12:53.407
it works with Me as you know.

00:12:53.487 --> 00:12:57.447
With My attention I work out many things.

00:12:57.527 --> 00:13:00.407
How?

00:13:00.487 --> 00:13:05.127
Just My attention has become thoughtless,

00:13:05.207 --> 00:13:08.247
just thoughtless.

00:13:08.327 --> 00:13:11.647
It goes wherever it goes, it works.

00:13:11.727 --> 00:13:16.887
But if you put your attention for thought all the time

00:13:16.967 --> 00:13:19.727
for thinking,

00:13:19.807 --> 00:13:24.927
then it doesn’t do the work that it has supposed to do.

00:13:26.527 --> 00:13:30.167
Attention works marvelously

00:13:32.007 --> 00:13:35.767
if you are thoughtless, otherwise it doesn’t.

00:13:38.007 --> 00:13:44.367
So it has to rise from your own self.

00:13:45.807 --> 00:13:49.167
Then from others

00:13:49.247 --> 00:13:53.087
to the higher level of humanity,

00:13:53.167 --> 00:13:57.367
where you are in communication with the sky,

00:13:57.447 --> 00:14:00.447
with, we can call it as the

00:14:00.527 --> 00:14:06.727
tanmatra, or the essential, or the essence

00:14:06.807 --> 00:14:09.367
of ether.

00:14:10.887 --> 00:14:14.767
With ether you can have
television, you can have telephone.

00:14:14.847 --> 00:14:17.127
It's a miracle otherwise.

00:14:17.207 --> 00:14:20.607
But with this tanmatra,

00:14:20.687 --> 00:14:23.047
sitting down here

00:14:23.127 --> 00:14:26.407
you can do the job.

00:14:26.487 --> 00:14:28.927
It works,

00:14:29.007 --> 00:14:32.527
just attention works. I know that.

00:14:32.607 --> 00:14:37.167
But lastly we get this thoughtless awareness

00:14:37.247 --> 00:14:43.247
by which our attention is absolutely free to do

00:14:43.327 --> 00:14:46.727
some special work.

00:14:46.807 --> 00:14:49.927
But if you are all the time thinking,

00:14:50.007 --> 00:14:53.567
then poor this attention

00:14:53.647 --> 00:14:57.887
is so busy, you know, so very busy.

00:14:57.967 --> 00:15:00.847
You don't have to ask Me then,

00:15:00.927 --> 00:15:04.207
"Mother, please pay attention." You can pay attention,

00:15:04.287 --> 00:15:06.887
and you can work it out.

00:15:11.127 --> 00:15:17.487
In this attention, you don't feel

00:15:17.567 --> 00:15:20.767
what you've got, what you are standing,

00:15:20.847 --> 00:15:28.247
what you are wearing, what
others are doing - no, nothing.

00:15:28.327 --> 00:15:32.487
You are one with yourself.

00:15:32.567 --> 00:15:37.567
And it's a life full of humor.

00:15:38.647 --> 00:15:41.727
So much humor.

00:15:41.807 --> 00:15:44.127
So much of joy.

00:15:44.207 --> 00:15:47.327
So much of happiness

00:15:47.407 --> 00:15:50.607
that you don't care for anything

00:15:50.687 --> 00:15:53.967
that normally people care for.

00:15:54.047 --> 00:15:59.167
Only thing, become thoughtlessly aware,

00:15:59.247 --> 00:16:01.527
as the blessing of Christ.

00:16:01.607 --> 00:16:03.847
If it works,

00:16:03.927 --> 00:16:09.527
you will be absolutely enjoying yourself.

00:16:13.948 --> 00:16:19.605
Where is your attention is the point.

00:16:19.685 --> 00:16:27.127
If you are the guru, where is your attention?

00:16:27.207 --> 00:16:39.208
If your attention is on the correction and
the nourishment of yourself and of others

00:16:39.288 --> 00:16:44.775
then you are first of all the Sahaja yogi.

00:16:47.336 --> 00:16:57.735
And once you rise above the
gravitational force of materialism,

00:16:57.815 --> 00:17:03.857
then you could be called as the guru.

00:17:07.278 --> 00:17:15.752
Anything that is living has a
capacity to rise against the gravity,

00:17:15.832 --> 00:17:22.772
up to a point, that is limited.

00:17:22.852 --> 00:17:31.479
Like we have seen the trees, they come
out of the Mother Earth and grow upward,

00:17:31.559 --> 00:17:42.351
up to a limited space. Every tree,
every type of tree has its own limitations.

00:17:42.431 --> 00:17:51.124
Cedar will be cedar and rose will be a rose.

00:17:51.204 --> 00:17:59.170
Is all controlled by the gravitational force.

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:13.939
But there is one thing which
rises against the gravitational force

00:18:14.019 --> 00:18:20.895
which has no limits, and that is your Kundalini.

00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:25.564
It cannot be controlled by the gravitational force

00:18:25.644 --> 00:18:34.147
unless and until you want it to be controlled.

00:18:34.227 --> 00:18:49.777
Nothing can control it but
you and your Self can control it.

00:18:49.857 --> 00:18:55.421
So, as soon as you become in charge of your Kundalini,

00:18:55.501 --> 00:19:02.613
you have crossed one step
forward that you have overcome

00:19:02.693 --> 00:19:07.853
the force that is the gravitational force.

00:19:12.008 --> 00:19:14.888
The truth always establishes itself slowly.

00:19:25.808 --> 00:19:28.728
Truth takes time to get established [within ourselves].

00:19:28.808 --> 00:19:36.648
Some people came in Sahaja Yoga and
took 8 to 9 months to get their realization.

00:19:36.728 --> 00:19:45.448
To achieve the truth, we should have depth inside us

00:19:45.528 --> 00:19:52.288
and the most important thing
is we have to be pure inside

00:19:52.368 --> 00:19:59.448
The more you keep your mind
pure, the happier you will be.

00:19:59.528 --> 00:20:12.048
So, while purifying our Chitta [attention], we should
remember that this Chitta is going to take us to God.

00:20:12.128 --> 00:20:19.848
Once we know God, the rest of the
things become easy to understand.

00:20:19.928 --> 00:20:26.088
Because when you get to the core of something,

00:20:26.168 --> 00:20:31.968
you understand the depth and extent of
the thing very easily and in a subtler way.

00:20:32.048 --> 00:20:42.848
Hence, you should always
keep your attention on your Chitta,

00:20:42.928 --> 00:20:46.888
“Where is my Chitta going?”

00:20:46.968 --> 00:21:03.128
"it's like - the more you are immersed
in the Ganges,the purer you become"

00:21:03.208 --> 00:21:05.728
One of the reasons for Nirvichara is that.

00:21:05.808 --> 00:21:11.048
But also, Nirvichara is a way to
express the blessings of your Mother.

00:21:11.128 --> 00:21:14.528
When She wants to bless you, you
see. You wrote the letter, She was happy.

00:21:14.608 --> 00:21:18.328
Just to bless you, you became
Nirvichar. You see, it’s the blessing.

00:21:18.408 --> 00:21:23.088
That’s how you, that’s the Grace, you
see, that comes to you from your Mother

00:21:23.168 --> 00:21:26.488
that you become Nirvichar. That’s one has to remember.

00:21:26.568 --> 00:21:30.488
If you do the things that I
tell you, I bless you very much

00:21:30.568 --> 00:21:34.248
because they are for your good, for your
Kalyana [well-being], for your Mangal [auspicious].

00:21:34.328 --> 00:21:38.408
And that’s why you are blessed and
that blessing you feel as Nirvichara.

00:21:38.488 --> 00:21:40.688
Because I am Nirvichara myself.
