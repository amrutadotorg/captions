SAHASRARA PUJA
4 MAY 1997

3
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,270
CABELLA

4
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:39,728
Today we all have assembled here to worship
the Sahasrara.

5
00:09:39,728 --> 00:10:01,439
As you have realised that Sahasrara is a very
important part of the subtle system.

6
00:10:01,439 --> 00:10:16,578
Of course this is a great day in 1970 that
this Chakra was opened up, but by that what

7
00:10:16,578 --> 00:10:20,729
you have achieved we have to see it.

8
00:10:20,729 --> 00:10:40,528
First of all when the Kundalini rises She
goes to your Void where is your dharma, and

9
00:10:40,528 --> 00:10:51,889
your dharma gets established at the Nahbi
Chakra, we can say, around the Nabhi Chakra.

10
00:10:51,889 --> 00:11:00,778
Your dharma gets established which is the
innate Pure Universal Religion.

11
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:03,479
It’s established.

12
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:08,899
But then the Kundalini rises higher.

13
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:19,419
Despite the establishment of the dharma we
start becoming little bit aloof from other

14
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:27,259
societies because we find they are amiss,
they have no dharma.

15
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:33,659
Also, I think we are afraid that we might
get caught up with their adharmas.

16
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:44,109
So, at that stage we don’t want to cross
the limits of Sahaja Yoga, want to keep to

17
00:11:44,109 --> 00:11:51,929
Sahaja Yogis, to Sahaja Yoga programme, and
to our personal Sahaj life.

18
00:11:51,929 --> 00:12:02,769
Of course, it is important because first this
Chakra must be fully nourished, and this Chakra

19
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:09,228
is actually moves around the Nahbi Chakra
which we know as Swadisthana.

20
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:19,719
This Swadishtan Chakra is in a way very important
because it supplies energy to the brain.

21
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:33,169
So when dharma is established the subtle energy
pushes through the Kundalini more energy for

22
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:46,948
the Sahasrara, and also the energy for dharma
which was in the Sahasrara, the Swadistana

23
00:12:46,948 --> 00:12:49,419
also starts flowing with it.

24
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:59,559
It crosses over and starts rising in the Sahasrara.

25
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:09,919
Till then we are, I would say, we are not
yet full Sahaja Yogis because one can become

26
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:12,809
fanatic about Sahaja Yoga.

27
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:20,129
I have seen people who are so fanatic that
they cannot even meet people who are not Sahaja

28
00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:26,719
Yogis, they cannot even talk to people who
are not Sahaja Yogis, and all the time they

29
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:32,709
are frightened of meeting people who are not
Sahaja Yogis.

30
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:38,969
Of course you need not meet people who are
evil, people who are against Sahaja Yoga,

31
00:13:38,969 --> 00:13:47,328
who talk against it, but those who are seeking
the truth, it is our duty that we have to

32
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:49,809
go to them.

33
00:13:49,809 --> 00:14:01,809
So when it reaches the state where it is established
in the brain, that time we go beyond dharma.

34
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:06,129
Dharmateet - we become beyond.

35
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:14,539
Dharma means that dharma becomes part and
parcel of our being, we cannot lose it.

36
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:24,839
Sahaj dharma becomes within us a part and
parcel which is a very great achievement because

37
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:30,989
then you don’t have to do any rituals, you
don’t have to worry about meeting other

38
00:14:30,989 --> 00:14:41,459
people, you don’t have to worry that your
vibrations will be harmed.

39
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:51,518
Then you don’t catch from anyone, you don’t
catch also other negative forces.

40
00:14:51,518 --> 00:14:55,219
No one can harm you.

41
00:14:55,219 --> 00:15:01,459
That I call as the completion of your Shradha.

42
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:11,559
That time Sahasrara is so fully englightened
that you become dharma.

43
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:19,629
For example, we can give the example of Christ.

44
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:24,078
Christ saw a protistute being stoned.

45
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:27,839
Now Christ had nothing to do with the prositute,
I mean just the opposite of it.

46
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:40,059
But when He saw she was stoned He took a stone
in His hand, and He says that those who think

47
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:46,339
who have not sinned at all can throw a stone
at Me.

48
00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:55,009
And everyone was standing: Why is He taking
the side of a protistute.

49
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:57,489
He is a religious man.

50
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:02,269
He should also put stones on her.

51
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:05,569
But He was standing on truth.

52
00:16:05,569 --> 00:16:13,078
That’s exactly what happens to you when
it is established in Sahasrara, in Sahasrara,

53
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:14,999
that you stand on truth.

54
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:25,369
There's a little difference in the, I would
say, in dharma and in truth.

55
00:16:25,369 --> 00:16:34,629
A dharma person might become too dharmic,
illogically dharmic and go to the right or

56
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:36,579
to the left.

57
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:47,978
A dharmic person might think he is the superior
person to others: that why should he be trying

58
00:16:47,978 --> 00:16:53,018
to save anybody else, let them go to hell,
who cares.

59
00:16:53,018 --> 00:16:58,319
This kind of an attitude can come in a person
who is dharmic.

60
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:05,509
Also I have seen some Sahaja Yogis who start
new methods in Sahaja Yoga.

61
00:17:05,509 --> 00:17:10,418
You do like this it will be alright, you do
like that it will be alright, because they

62
00:17:10,418 --> 00:17:16,509
are not stagnated at the point of dharma,
so they start telling people that you do this

63
00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:18,388
way do that way.

64
00:17:18,388 --> 00:17:25,379
But when you rise to the point of truth, then
you don’t do any rituals, you don’t need

65
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:36,209
any rituals, you are not bothered, because
you are in dharma and here you are standing

66
00:17:36,209 --> 00:17:41,709
on the truth, and truth is much greater than
dharma.

67
00:17:41,709 --> 00:17:53,608
For example, a person who is standing on truth
- he doesn’t care for any absurd ideas about

68
00:17:53,608 --> 00:17:57,608
religion even about Sahaj religion.

69
00:17:57,608 --> 00:18:05,539
He doesn’t care that after all this is Sahaj
this is not Sahaj, he goes beyond.

70
00:18:05,539 --> 00:18:09,539
In the sense he sees a global truth within
himself.

71
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:19,139
He sees the truth which is all pervading,
not only sees but he knows and he feels and

72
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:23,749
he is in that truth.

73
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:31,749
So when dharma flowers into truth it’s a
very beautiful happening and that should happen

74
00:18:31,749 --> 00:18:35,789
to all of you.

75
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:41,579
So many things can linger on if you are only
on the dharma level.

76
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:48,669
I have seen people going into ego, making
money.

77
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:53,819
Sometimes they don’t even ask me and go
on doing things which they should not do.

78
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:58,989
They do wrong things which are not good for
Sahaja Yoga.

79
00:18:58,989 --> 00:19:10,009
There is no humility about it and they don’t
understand that whether this dharma is standing

80
00:19:10,009 --> 00:19:13,279
on truth or untruth.

81
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:19,609
So we have to go to the foundation of dharma
which is truth.

82
00:19:19,609 --> 00:19:26,949
As described before it’s a tree of life
which has got its roots in the brain and the

83
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:29,249
branches in the body.

84
00:19:29,249 --> 00:19:36,239
So you have to go to the roots of everything
and that is the place where you reach when

85
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:40,079
you are absolutely established in Sahasrara.

86
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:53,939
In the Sahasrara are the roots of all these
ideas we have, or we can say, all these swarupas

87
00:19:53,939 --> 00:19:57,189
we have taken.

88
00:19:57,189 --> 00:20:00,079
We have now become dharmic.

89
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:02,609
What is the root of dharma?

90
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:08,029
Why should we be dharmic?

91
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:09,449
What is the need to be dharmic?

92
00:20:09,449 --> 00:20:14,909
There are many people in this world who are
extremely adharmic living very well.

93
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:20,979
According to, I mean, outward expression we
feel that they are very happy people, they

94
00:20:20,979 --> 00:20:29,059
are alright they are enjoying themselves while
we are deprived perhaps of all the so-called

95
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:32,579
enjoyments of these people.

96
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:44,459
So at the state of only dharma things become
very important to us which are, may not be

97
00:20:44,459 --> 00:20:46,529
standing on truth.

98
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:52,879
There are so many things like that I can point
it out to you that how Sahaja Yogis faulter,

99
00:20:52,879 --> 00:20:56,709
even after acheiving dharma state they faulter.

100
00:20:56,709 --> 00:21:09,979
I have seen people giving up their drugs,
alcoholism, giving up other kinds of addictions,

101
00:21:09,979 --> 00:21:11,929
even their language improves.

102
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:22,669
And their, we can say, behaviour is changed,
they become humbler people no doubt, but still

103
00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:27,839
they are conscious that they are standing
on dharma.

104
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:32,999
This consciousness has to disappear.

105
00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:51,819
At the state of Sahasrara this consciousness
disappears because truth is love and love

106
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:54,439
is truth.

107
00:21:54,439 --> 00:22:01,089
That is the point where the Kundalini meets
the Heart Chakra.

108
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:05,109
As you know the pita of heart is here.

109
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:14,269
So when Kundalini pierces through that Heart
Chakra, what starts flowing in the brain,

110
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:20,799
in the Sahasrara is the truth, but truth that
is love.

111
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:29,089
There’s a difference between truth as itself
and truth that is love.

112
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:35,059
So out of love for that prostitute that Christ
stood by her.

113
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:46,359
He stood on the roots of truth no doubt, but
what was flowing through His heart was the

114
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:49,949
love, the pure love.

115
00:22:49,949 --> 00:22:58,689
So now when we have pure love for someone,
we see the whole thing in a different manner,

116
00:22:58,689 --> 00:23:07,149
we see a person in a different manner and
it becomes very sweet.

117
00:23:07,149 --> 00:23:21,389
Otherwise truth can be very bitter, can be
very painful, but truth which is adorned with

118
00:23:21,389 --> 00:23:26,319
love is just like a flower without the thorns.

119
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:38,349
It’s very interesting how a person who is
pouring with love and is standing on truth

120
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:43,789
- that’s the personality you have to become.

121
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:52,569
Now in the expression of love we can take
an example to understand.

122
00:23:52,569 --> 00:23:59,459
Supposing I meet somebody and he is telling
all kinds of horrible things about another

123
00:23:59,459 --> 00:24:02,829
person.

124
00:24:02,829 --> 00:24:09,789
So I feel tremendous love for him as well
as for the person whom he is telling all these

125
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:10,789
things.

126
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:21,989
So now I take to lie, a complete lie, which
is a truth, also in a way.

127
00:24:21,989 --> 00:24:26,169
I tell that person, see what are you talking.

128
00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:32,149
The person about whom you are saying all this
had been just praising you all the time and

129
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:34,879
here you are talking like this.

130
00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:43,759
Now this is not the truth actually, but you
take the help of the lie, the other side of

131
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:50,809
the truth, to bring out a friendship between
the two persons.

132
00:24:50,809 --> 00:25:00,109
So this is what is the work of love, that
it tries to bring people closer to each other:

133
00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:10,259
to say things by which they become one, united.

134
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:17,879
So all the divisive methods that we have used
so far just disappear and we try to understand

135
00:25:17,879 --> 00:25:29,119
what is the method by which we can join people’s
heart.

136
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:35,820
As it is you are in collective consciousness,
but this collective consciousness, if it is

137
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:46,199
supericial you can achieve great results like
as you have done it - maybe you can build

138
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:51,439
beautiful ashrams, you can do all this.

139
00:25:51,439 --> 00:26:02,039
But when it is filled with love, collective
consciousness, then the joy is complete of

140
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:06,299
collective consciousness.

141
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:09,629
Now people talk of peace.

142
00:26:09,629 --> 00:26:16,039
You cannot have peace without this new awareness
we call it collective consciousness, but in

143
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:27,338
that also there has to be the main tattwa,
principle of love.

144
00:26:27,338 --> 00:26:38,919
For example now, Sahaja Yogis say from Germany
and Austria are going to Israel - it is very

145
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:39,919
fulfilling.

146
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:49,989
I was happy that they have chosen for this
Puja people from Israel, and then I found

147
00:26:49,989 --> 00:26:59,549
Israelies coming to Egypt forgetting all that
Muslims had done to them.

148
00:26:59,549 --> 00:27:08,719
It’s really remarkable how people get attracted
towards expression of their love, to their

149
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:17,429
fellow men, to other Sahaja Yogis, and once
it starts growing you will be surprised how

150
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:20,539
we can change this world.

151
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:31,939
Most of the problems, human problems, are
due to hatred and is very commonly used - I

152
00:27:31,939 --> 00:27:38,139
hate, I hate, it’s absurdity, it’s a sin
to hate someone.

153
00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:41,369
Why do you hate someone.

154
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:48,099
You can hate the sin, you can hate the evil,
but you should not hate people just for hating

155
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:49,549
sake.

156
00:27:49,549 --> 00:27:57,019
This hatred that we have is responsible for
all the problems we have had so far.

157
00:27:57,019 --> 00:28:04,559
Because one person becomes very powerful,
by dividing people he becomes very powerful,

158
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:11,079
and these divisive things have really crushed
so many countries.

159
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:20,509
For example our country was divided by the
British, now they are having the division.

160
00:28:20,509 --> 00:28:23,949
This doesn’t stop.

161
00:28:23,949 --> 00:28:26,139
By dividing us what has happened?

162
00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:32,119
All the countries who have gone away from
India are suffering very much.

163
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:38,019
Those people who tried to divide the country
thought that they’d become prime ministers,

164
00:28:38,019 --> 00:28:39,289
this that.

165
00:28:39,289 --> 00:28:43,879
Most of them have been murdered by their own
people.

166
00:28:43,879 --> 00:28:47,769
You can see clearly how hatred manifests itself.

167
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:57,409
It starts from a small point and it manifests
all over, very clearly it can be seen in any

168
00:28:57,409 --> 00:28:59,689
country being divided.

169
00:28:59,689 --> 00:29:08,789
There’s no need to divide any country - that
creates more hatred and more trouble.

170
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:19,819
In the same way in Sahaja Yoga we should not
think of have divisions.

171
00:29:19,819 --> 00:29:28,359
Now we have got a beautiful land – as that
you must have heard about near to Ganges.

172
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:37,019
Now people are thinking if they can have separate
houses, separate compounds.

173
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:40,759
Why?

174
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:46,499
You know how to live collectively, you enjoy
collective life, so why do you want to have

175
00:29:46,499 --> 00:29:49,659
separate houses?

176
00:29:49,659 --> 00:29:52,419
What secrets are we going to have from each
other?

177
00:29:52,419 --> 00:30:01,789
After all whatever we do is known on the vibrations
- you cannot hide anything, so why have separate

178
00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:02,889
houses.

179
00:30:02,889 --> 00:30:09,699
Why do you want to have some privacy, because
in Sahaja Yoga there is no privacy.

180
00:30:09,699 --> 00:30:18,409
We know about everyone, what are they up to,
what are their problems, what chakras they

181
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:19,479
are catching.

182
00:30:19,479 --> 00:30:20,559
Isn’t it?

183
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,789
So there is no secret about anything in Sahaja
Yoga.

184
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:31,219
Everyone knows about everyone, so what’s
the use of having privacy - also I can’t

185
00:30:31,219 --> 00:30:32,219
understand.

186
00:30:32,219 --> 00:30:39,759
It’s like this you see still the mind is
working like that.

187
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:43,449
Then they are thinking of inheritance.

188
00:30:43,449 --> 00:30:52,369
Alright, I was saying that you can have inheritance,
but if your son is not a Sahaja Yogi, what

189
00:30:52,369 --> 00:30:53,369
to do.

190
00:30:53,369 --> 00:31:01,289
We cannot keep a culprit there to trouble
everyone.

191
00:31:01,289 --> 00:31:09,919
It is not the rules and regulations that are
going to keep you happy and joined together,

192
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:16,499
but it is the pure collective consciousness
and its love.

193
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:24,289
Because as you know we have no proper organisations,
we have no clergyship, we have nothing like

194
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:25,289
that.

195
00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:30,979
Leaders also can shift more times than Ganges
River can shift its course.

196
00:31:30,979 --> 00:31:32,469
So there is nothing like that.

197
00:31:32,469 --> 00:31:38,899
It’s all on a shifty sand we are standing,
all the time, and your Mother is another one

198
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:42,239
who tries all kinds of tricks.

199
00:31:42,239 --> 00:31:54,959
The reason is I want you to stand on rocks
and this rock is emitting love, is emitting

200
00:31:54,959 --> 00:32:06,889
that Divine Love, and the joy of that love
is really so beautiful.

201
00:32:06,889 --> 00:32:13,219
For example, people would like to have their
separate bathrooms, specially Indians, suddenly

202
00:32:13,219 --> 00:32:18,319
they have become Britishers and Britishers
have become Indians you know.

203
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:24,779
Indians want to have their separate bathrooms
- I don’t know why, and uh, this is a very

204
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:27,329
common disease with Indians.

205
00:32:27,329 --> 00:32:33,189
And it is also spreading to other people I
feel sometimes that they want to have their

206
00:32:33,189 --> 00:32:36,049
separate bathrooms.

207
00:32:36,049 --> 00:32:38,659
In a collective life there is no need.

208
00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:45,669
You don’t even know, if you ask me I won’t
even know if I have been to bathroom or not,

209
00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:48,129
just go there come back, finished.

210
00:32:48,129 --> 00:32:53,589
I have no time for all that.

211
00:32:53,589 --> 00:33:03,399
In the same way you also should have a concept
of a society which is living like a ocean,

212
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:08,209
if ocean rises they rise, it falls they fall
- just one [unison?

213
00:33:08,209 --> 00:33:09,209
union?

214
00:33:09,209 --> 00:33:11,159
Sounds like "unigon"] of Love.

215
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:21,429
I am expecting that kind of a society at the
foothill of Himalayas, and I am sure you all

216
00:33:21,429 --> 00:33:28,579
of you realise that Himalaya being the Sahasrara
of the world.

217
00:33:28,579 --> 00:33:37,219
Luckily I wanted it to be done before the
Sahasrara Puja and it is done, with the blessings

218
00:33:37,219 --> 00:33:39,829
of Himalayas I should say.

219
00:33:39,829 --> 00:33:47,879
The Himalaya is also like the Sahasrara where
the Kundalini has risen, where the vibrations

220
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:52,999
have come out, and in the sky you can see
the vibrations.

221
00:33:52,999 --> 00:34:04,429
But this Himalaya is ruled by a wrathful God
called Shiva - that’s the dangerous part

222
00:34:04,429 --> 00:34:06,249
of it.

223
00:34:06,249 --> 00:34:10,809
So we have to be very, very careful.

224
00:34:10,809 --> 00:34:25,959
If we try to play around, if we try to
take to hatred among ourselves, take to divisive

225
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:36,559
methods, take to something that is not Sahaj,
this wrathful God is sitting on our head.

226
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:42,849
He’s also in Mecca, this is Mecaisha Shiv
there.

227
00:34:42,849 --> 00:34:48,469
If you try to misbehave he comes out with
his wrathfulness.

228
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:55,159
Anywhere where you are you have to be very
careful that this Shiva is everywhere.

229
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:07,910
Like one of these Lingas of Shiva is in [Perlybaithnath?],
that is in Maharastra, Alahathur, and there

230
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:15,839
people started another kind of Sahaja Yoga,
also they were drinking on the day of the

231
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:30,159
Shri Ganesha’s celebrations, so the wrath
of Shivalinga came and there was such a big,

232
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:32,879
huge earthquake.

233
00:35:32,879 --> 00:35:43,149
Many people were lost but none of the Sahaja
Yogis, and their centre was saved completely.

234
00:35:43,149 --> 00:35:49,909
Now we had a big fire also as you know last
time and nothing happened to you, you are

235
00:35:49,909 --> 00:35:51,249
under protection.

236
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:54,219
You are all the time protected.

237
00:35:54,219 --> 00:36:00,329
There was no wrath of Shiva that could work
out anything.

238
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:04,049
Fire could not do anything to you because
you are under protection.

239
00:36:04,049 --> 00:36:08,929
But this protection is your Mother’s love.

240
00:36:08,929 --> 00:36:15,769
It’s not anything else but the love of your
Mother, which is very powerful, and which

241
00:36:15,769 --> 00:36:18,999
is protecting you and helping you.

242
00:36:18,999 --> 00:36:26,188
In the same way you develop that kind of love
for others, for other Sahaja Yogis, for other

243
00:36:26,188 --> 00:36:31,629
people, for other things, for this Mother
earth, for all that.

244
00:36:31,629 --> 00:36:39,569
Your love can not only protect you but protect
others also.

245
00:36:39,569 --> 00:36:45,949
Your attention as long as it is on yourself
will start becoming smaller and smaller.

246
00:36:45,949 --> 00:36:51,439
I should have this, I should have that, I
like this, I like that.

247
00:36:51,439 --> 00:36:54,699
All these topics will fall.

248
00:36:54,699 --> 00:36:59,869
You’ll never say ‘I like this’.

249
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:02,129
No question.

250
00:37:02,129 --> 00:37:03,199
What do I like?

251
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:11,829
It is difficult for me to decide if I like
anything - this I like, that I like, I like

252
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:13,749
to be this way.

253
00:37:13,749 --> 00:37:14,789
Who are you?

254
00:37:14,789 --> 00:37:18,279
Ask yourself the question.

255
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:20,829
Who are you?

256
00:37:20,829 --> 00:37:30,829
If you are the pure spirit it is nothing but
love, and in love you think of others, the

257
00:37:30,829 --> 00:37:38,099
problems of others, you try to make others
comfortable, you try to look after others

258
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:43,549
and you don’t just look after yourself and
bother about yourself.

259
00:37:43,549 --> 00:37:45,649
This is what you have to reach.

260
00:37:45,649 --> 00:37:51,609
Though you may be dharmic, you may be in every
way Sahaj, but still, unless and until you

261
00:37:51,609 --> 00:38:01,039
reach that state in your Sahasrara, I wouldn’t
say that you are alright.

262
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:02,899
You have to work it out.

263
00:38:02,899 --> 00:38:10,429
For that, of course, meditation is very important,
but the thing that stops it is your mind.

264
00:38:10,429 --> 00:38:14,229
It's your mind that goes on telling you.

265
00:38:14,229 --> 00:38:18,269
All the time you watch your mind how it tries
to guide you.

266
00:38:18,269 --> 00:38:25,709
How it tries to tell you - now what about
me, what about my house, what about my children,

267
00:38:25,709 --> 00:38:28,979
what about my country.

268
00:38:28,979 --> 00:38:35,289
Like that you go on ‘my, my, my, my, my’
- ultimately you end up into nothing.

269
00:38:35,289 --> 00:38:42,159
But when you say ‘you, you, you’ - Kabira
has said a beautiful thing about it.

270
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:52,609
He says that when the goat is living it is
saying: ‘Meh, meh, meh’ which means I,

271
00:38:52,609 --> 00:38:53,959
I, I.

272
00:38:53,959 --> 00:39:02,938
But it dies, then they take out the intestine
and put in on a dunkih, where they put it

273
00:39:02,938 --> 00:39:07,009
for the cleaning of the cotton.

274
00:39:07,009 --> 00:39:13,688
And that time what does that dunkih say: ‘Tuhi,
tuhi, tuhi’ - you are the one, you are,

275
00:39:13,688 --> 00:39:19,739
you are, you are - and that he calls all over.

276
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:25,009
In the same way you have to think from other’s
point of view.

277
00:39:25,009 --> 00:39:32,579
First of all tuhi when you say, you say it
to your Guru or to God that you are - I am

278
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:39,499
no more, I am dissolved, I am finished, I
have become one with this ocean of love.

279
00:39:39,499 --> 00:39:49,259
And then you say to others: ‘you are, you
are’ that is Sahaj Culture.

280
00:39:49,259 --> 00:39:58,109
See, so lots of falsehood will follow - falsehood
that surrenders you and others.

281
00:39:58,109 --> 00:40:06,709
Like people try falsehood by saying something
‘I love you very much’ and on the back

282
00:40:06,709 --> 00:40:09,679
they plan something very bad.

283
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:12,438
They can do anything.

284
00:40:12,438 --> 00:40:16,949
Not Sahaja Yogis they don’t do it, I must
say, that they have reached the stage where

285
00:40:16,949 --> 00:40:18,439
they don’t do it.

286
00:40:18,439 --> 00:40:22,549
But still if they don’t do it they are conscious
of it.

287
00:40:22,549 --> 00:40:30,429
All the time they are conscious, we don’t
do this, we don’t drink - so what, we don’t

288
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:32,039
fuss about food.

289
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:38,769
I mean all their things they have achieved
they are very proud of it, you see very proud

290
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:42,019
- that we are like this, we are that.

291
00:40:42,019 --> 00:40:49,569
You see, because you are the pure spirit,
because you are that, so you have become that.

292
00:40:49,569 --> 00:40:53,749
How can you take pride in something what you
are?

293
00:40:53,749 --> 00:40:58,829
Like somebody asked me: don’t you feel very
proud that you are the Adi Shakti?

294
00:40:58,829 --> 00:41:02,579
I said ‘What?’

295
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:04,469
I couldn’t understand the question.

296
00:41:04,469 --> 00:41:10,240
I said see now, if I am Adi Shakti what is
there to be proud, because I am that, what

297
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,879
is there to be proud?

298
00:41:11,879 --> 00:41:17,929
If I was not that then I would be proud of
it, but I was, so what is there to be proud

299
00:41:17,929 --> 00:41:18,999
of.

300
00:41:18,999 --> 00:41:26,529
Like the sun, it shines, it’s not proud
that ‘I am the sun’, or if you are born,

301
00:41:26,529 --> 00:41:35,509
say, with your eyes and nose, a face like
a human being, you are not proud: I'm a human

302
00:41:35,509 --> 00:41:38,899
being, I'm a human being - are you proud?

303
00:41:38,899 --> 00:41:47,678
In the same way if you are that what you are,
you are not proud, you are not conscious of

304
00:41:47,678 --> 00:41:50,879
it, not at all conscious.

305
00:41:50,879 --> 00:41:54,799
I mean, I never tell myself I am Adi Shakti,
there’s no need to tell.

306
00:41:54,799 --> 00:41:56,399
But it is so, what to do.

307
00:41:56,399 --> 00:42:01,949
Now God has chosen me, I should say, to be
Adi Shakti, alright, I can have it.

308
00:42:01,949 --> 00:42:07,729
But I just don’t know what is there - as
if like some people think that, Sahaja Yoga

309
00:42:07,729 --> 00:42:14,909
has been bestowed upon them like some Lordship
or something like that.

310
00:42:14,909 --> 00:42:24,599
It is what you have become - when you become,
you must understand that you have become that.

311
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:34,438
Like supposing a stone becomes gold, then
it is gold, it won’t be proud that ‘I’m

312
00:42:34,438 --> 00:42:35,438
gold’ - gold is gold.

313
00:42:35,438 --> 00:42:38,759
Why will it be proud of that?

314
00:42:38,759 --> 00:42:48,129
In the same way this consciousness of being
a Sahaja Yogi drops off.

315
00:42:48,129 --> 00:42:54,649
Still it lingers - so one has to be careful
that once you are a Sahaja Yogi, you are a

316
00:42:54,649 --> 00:42:56,289
Sahaja Yogi - so what.

317
00:42:56,289 --> 00:43:01,219
I am a Sahaji , so what, nothing so great.

318
00:43:01,219 --> 00:43:08,109
It’s like saying that I have a nose, you
see, and be proud of saying I have a nose.

319
00:43:08,109 --> 00:43:13,808
Nose is already there, what is there to be
proud of - But this pride has to go.

320
00:43:13,808 --> 00:43:21,688
That’s very important to realise that I’m
not there, I’m no more - I’m one of the

321
00:43:21,688 --> 00:43:28,808
whole - become the ocean this drop of mine
- I don’t know if there are any boundaries

322
00:43:28,808 --> 00:43:30,359
left in me.

323
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:36,739
This kind of consciousness develops in you,
when your consciousness is filled with joy

324
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:43,409
- just with joy and bubbling with love - bubbling
with love.

325
00:43:43,409 --> 00:43:54,278
You go on see expressing your love, whether
you talk or you don’t talk, whether you

326
00:43:54,278 --> 00:44:04,589
say about it or you don’t, whether you are
smiling or not, this joy is in your heart.

327
00:44:04,589 --> 00:44:18,339
Now the Heart Chakra here, the pita of the
Heart Chakra, gets filled with light of truth,

328
00:44:18,339 --> 00:44:26,589
but the truth is not such an absurd thing
that we know of as truth is.

329
00:44:26,589 --> 00:44:30,149
For somebody asked me what is the truth.

330
00:44:30,149 --> 00:44:40,139
So I said that it was written long time back,
that you should speak the truth and speak

331
00:44:40,139 --> 00:44:47,279
something that people will like - Satjamvadeth
priyamvadeth.

332
00:44:47,279 --> 00:44:51,159
Then people said, how can you make this truth.

333
00:44:51,159 --> 00:44:59,209
Truth may not be palatable and could be something
that you say which people like, and may be

334
00:44:59,209 --> 00:45:03,729
false, so how to make these two things meet.

335
00:45:03,729 --> 00:45:12,889
So Krishna gave a very good answer, He said
it’s like this: Satyamvadeth, hitamvadeth,

336
00:45:12,889 --> 00:45:13,889
primamvadeth.

337
00:45:13,889 --> 00:45:21,449
You say the truth, truth you must say, but
that truth should be good, or should be liked

338
00:45:21,449 --> 00:45:30,059
or should be appreciated or should be nourishing
for your spirit, by which there is benevolence

339
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:36,579
which creates benevolence, and then it has
to be priya.

340
00:45:36,579 --> 00:45:43,049
In the beginning, people may not like and
say that ‘he said horrible things to me’

341
00:45:43,049 --> 00:45:51,179
or whatever it is - but at the end of it he’ll
say that see, it’s so good that this was

342
00:45:51,179 --> 00:45:55,149
said to me that I have done something perfect.

343
00:45:55,149 --> 00:46:02,839
But in any case there is no need to say something
very harsh or hard to anyone.

344
00:46:02,839 --> 00:46:08,969
That is not your job to go on correcting all
the rest of the people.

345
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:13,729
To begin with, many Sahaja Yogis, I have seen,
have been saying: you’ve got this chakra

346
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,929
caught up, you’ve got that chakra caught
up.

347
00:46:15,929 --> 00:46:19,639
All this is the play of ego.

348
00:46:19,639 --> 00:46:24,699
You have no business to condemn anyone, you
have come from such a condemned condition

349
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:27,929
yourself, so why are you condemning others.

350
00:46:27,929 --> 00:46:35,169
Only thing is if you are capable, if you are
equipped, if you are matured enough in Sahaja

351
00:46:35,169 --> 00:46:43,359
Yoga, then you will just take it up as a great
challenge of love and you will do it.

352
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:47,800
But you won’t go on condemning that person,
finding faults with that person, it’s a

353
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:52,529
very good excuse if you don’t want to do
it.

354
00:46:52,529 --> 00:46:58,509
Supposing somebody is sick and the doctor
doesn’t know how to cure, so what does he

355
00:46:58,509 --> 00:46:59,509
do?

356
00:46:59,509 --> 00:47:05,319
He says you see you are sick because this
happened, because you went in the cold.

357
00:47:05,319 --> 00:47:11,119
Because this haribaba yes, but now I am sick
so now what about curing me.

358
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:16,239
No, because you did this, because you did
that, you should not have done this.

359
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:19,139
All about the past mistakes, he’ll go on.

360
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:25,849
In the same way we go on: that you did like
this, you were like this, you went to the

361
00:47:25,849 --> 00:47:31,099
falara guru, you did this kind of a mistake,
that’s why you are like this.

362
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:36,079
No, don’t tell him anything, just work it
out and it works.

363
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:42,738
Of course, you can ask if he has been to some
guru, but don’t condemn, don’t criticise,

364
00:47:42,738 --> 00:47:48,649
there is no need to condemn anybody for what
mistakes they have committed.

365
00:47:48,649 --> 00:47:53,909
This is all coming from the consciousness
that you are better equipped, that you have

366
00:47:53,909 --> 00:47:55,359
all the knowledge.

367
00:47:55,359 --> 00:48:01,849
You have, you are very knowledge people, I
must say very knowledgable.

368
00:48:01,849 --> 00:48:11,449
You are the gnostics, all that I accept, but
as long as you are aware of it you are not.

369
00:48:11,449 --> 00:48:20,069
Once you are not aware of it then you are
that what is called Sahaja Yogi.

370
00:48:20,069 --> 00:48:26,899
So I would expect all of you to have this
new development in their Sahasrara, in your

371
00:48:26,899 --> 00:48:29,929
Sahasrara, in everybody’s Sahasrara.

372
00:48:29,929 --> 00:48:31,829
We have to think of the whole world.

373
00:48:31,829 --> 00:48:35,880
We cannot just think of Sahaja Yogis and also
about the seekers.

374
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:40,470
Seekers are there, alright, but what about
the rest.

375
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:44,519
There are so many problems there and so many
things are to be done.

376
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:50,059
For example, now we have a problem in India
of poverty.

377
00:48:50,059 --> 00:48:52,849
So I am trying to do something for them.

378
00:48:52,849 --> 00:48:55,729
You have problems in your countries.

379
00:48:55,729 --> 00:48:58,709
You should find out what problems there are.

380
00:48:58,709 --> 00:49:05,238
You can start some sort of a movement for
them, try to help them as far as possible.

381
00:49:05,238 --> 00:49:12,119
It’s not missionary like, that you convert
somebody for some sort of a reward or for

382
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:17,679
some name you have to do - you just do it
for your pleasure, because it’s your pleasure

383
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:18,829
to do it.

384
00:49:18,829 --> 00:49:23,659
That’s how you'll go to the society and
you won’t be afraid that you'll be caught

385
00:49:23,659 --> 00:49:24,659
up.

386
00:49:24,659 --> 00:49:30,238
I know of one couple, when I asked them, why
don’t you start working it out.

387
00:49:30,238 --> 00:49:33,329
So they said ‘Mother we are afraid our ego
will come back’.

388
00:49:33,329 --> 00:49:38,239
They are afraid of themselves only - their
ego will come back.

389
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:44,709
So all these problems should be dropped out
and you should reach that state where you

390
00:49:44,709 --> 00:49:51,079
don’t have all these fears, all these non-sensical
ideas about yourself.

391
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:53,189
You are powerful.

392
00:49:53,189 --> 00:49:55,199
You have powers.

393
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:59,069
Not only that, but you have been specially
bestowed with those powers.

394
00:49:59,069 --> 00:50:02,699
But if you don’t want use it then what are
you?

395
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:10,429
If the lamp is not enlightened what is this
lamp for - just for decoration?

396
00:50:10,429 --> 00:50:17,228
So this has to be used, and this has to be
used without feeling that awareness within

397
00:50:17,228 --> 00:50:24,309
you that you are something great, better than
others, something selected, or also they say

398
00:50:24,309 --> 00:50:28,199
that we are chosen.

399
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:35,319
So, this can spread very fast with such grace
and understanding.

400
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:40,479
All kinds of stupid people are there, it’s
alright, you know they are stupid - just laugh

401
00:50:40,479 --> 00:50:45,429
at them, make fun of them and that’s how
you can solve the problem.

402
00:50:45,429 --> 00:50:51,809
But even that, you should do it in such a
way that you don’t hurt them, that whatever

403
00:50:51,809 --> 00:50:56,899
you do you should see from the results what
works out.

404
00:50:56,899 --> 00:51:09,099
Results should be such that you should see,
how it works out.

405
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:13,589
With some people - that’s the intelligence,
I think that’s the superior intelligence

406
00:51:13,589 --> 00:51:20,269
by which you know how to say things, what
to say things and how to work it out.

407
00:51:20,269 --> 00:51:30,599
Love, this Divine Love, gives you a complete
control over yourself, and you know everything,

408
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:36,759
how to behave, how to talk to people, how
to manage them.

409
00:51:36,759 --> 00:51:44,709
I don’t know what is the worst thing among
human beings.

410
00:51:44,709 --> 00:51:55,199
According to Krishna it was temper - hot temper
was the worst thing, but according to me it

411
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:59,399
is jealousy.

412
00:51:59,399 --> 00:52:06,089
Jealousy of any kind is absolutely, I should
say, like a scum.

413
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:14,419
In Sahaja Yoga also people feel jealous and
they may not say so because I don’t like

414
00:52:14,419 --> 00:52:22,259
it, but they may create problem, they may
try to create problem among each other.

415
00:52:22,259 --> 00:52:28,609
So one thing you should have a watch on your
mind if there is any kind of jealousy.

416
00:52:28,609 --> 00:52:36,139
I’m rather worried sometimes - supposing
I want to give some present to some people,

417
00:52:36,139 --> 00:52:43,189
then I’m worried that I shouldn’t do something
that will create jealousy.

418
00:52:43,189 --> 00:52:47,189
We should not.

419
00:52:47,189 --> 00:52:54,169
Mother might have forgotten, or it’s alright
she’s running short of it - it’s alright.

420
00:52:54,169 --> 00:53:01,849
But people have that kind of a very sharp
sense of jealousy when in Sahaja Yoga.

421
00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:07,619
Now supposing I meet somebody and I don’t
meet somebody else - finished.

422
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:12,879
That person developes a jealousy for that
person whom I meet.

423
00:53:12,879 --> 00:53:16,799
Sometimes people pester me too much - ‘Mother,
I must meet you, I must meet you’.

424
00:53:16,799 --> 00:53:19,549
I don’t know why, why do you want to meet
me.

425
00:53:19,549 --> 00:53:25,149
I’m all over, everywhere as you say.

426
00:53:25,149 --> 00:53:30,679
Then what is the need that you should meet
me and talk to me - what is the need?

427
00:53:30,679 --> 00:53:38,209
It’s not for you alone I am, I’m for everyone,
but some people think that they have a special

428
00:53:38,209 --> 00:53:45,579
right on me and they think that I must meet
them indivdually, otherwise they feel very

429
00:53:45,579 --> 00:53:46,579
bad.

430
00:53:46,579 --> 00:53:54,419
All these things have to go away in a big
way when you become as I said, the ocean.

431
00:53:54,419 --> 00:54:01,709
Then you are not bothered what shore you go,
where you travel, you are not bothered, you

432
00:54:01,709 --> 00:54:05,719
are only with the ocean moving up and down.

433
00:54:05,719 --> 00:54:14,189
That is how it’s a living ocean of love,
and that’s what we have to develop it- without

434
00:54:14,189 --> 00:54:20,709
dominating others, without showing off.

435
00:54:20,709 --> 00:54:28,719
It should be, the whole thing should be contented
within ourself.

436
00:54:28,719 --> 00:54:37,839
In Hindi it is said better: Apneme ...(hindi...ndt).

437
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:46,789
Should be all within yourself and that’s
the most enjoyable thing.

438
00:54:46,789 --> 00:54:55,369
Because see what we want, supposing I want
something for myself, you see, so I’ll strive

439
00:54:55,369 --> 00:54:56,849
and get it.

440
00:54:56,849 --> 00:55:06,719
But this is something if you have within yourself,
you fully filled within yourself.

441
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:11,759
So what is most important, what is so much
needed?

442
00:55:11,759 --> 00:55:13,549
Nothing!

443
00:55:13,549 --> 00:55:26,929
You are completely filled with yourself, contented
with yourself, and then you want to share.

444
00:55:26,929 --> 00:55:36,569
This is the ideal way of dealing with Sahasrara,
I think, and I am sure the day will come this

445
00:55:36,569 --> 00:55:43,149
whole world’s Sahasrara has to be opened
out.

446
00:55:43,149 --> 00:55:49,439
This is what we have to do it, and we are
not going to disappear into some exclusive

447
00:55:49,439 --> 00:55:57,829
places that is just for meditation - you can
go there, but not for escaping the world.

448
00:55:57,829 --> 00:55:59,389
That is not the idea.

449
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:07,399
Idea is for meditation, for your growth - it
would be a nice place to go to.

450
00:56:07,399 --> 00:56:24,099
It is very important to understand how valuable
you are, how remarkably important you are

451
00:56:24,099 --> 00:56:33,069
- born at this time, got your realisation
for what?

452
00:56:33,069 --> 00:56:44,228
To emancipate this world, to transform human
beings, to take whole of this world into the

453
00:56:44,228 --> 00:56:45,799
realm of God.

454
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:48,100
That is what you are here for.

455
00:56:48,389 --> 00:56:50,070
May God bless you.
