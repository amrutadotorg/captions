Shri Adi Shakti Puja
Cabella, Itália, 15.06.2003

00:39:08.305 --> 00:39:09.937
Can you hear me?

00:39:14.662 --> 00:39:19.748
I am very happy all of you are here

00:39:19.929 --> 00:39:29.344
singing the song of Gondari.

00:39:32.301 --> 00:39:38.488
 Perhaps you do not know the meaning.

00:39:38.595 --> 00:39:51.148
That is ‘We are the singers of Shri Mataji’.

00:39:53.903 --> 00:40:09.542
  And these are the songs sung by people who are villagers

00:40:09.762 --> 00:40:14.500
 and they are singing this song

00:40:14.735 --> 00:40:24.694
 that ‘We are singing the song of our Mother,

00:40:24.833 --> 00:40:29.548
with all our love for Her’.

00:40:29.749 --> 00:40:36.946
 And all that singing has come to you –

00:40:37.099 --> 00:40:41.954
 is very, very happy for Me

00:40:42.274 --> 00:40:46.013
because these are only ordinary villagers

00:40:46.038 --> 00:40:48.737
and how you have picked up

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:57.757
such a nice mood and songs from them.

00:40:57.850 --> 00:41:00.156
May God bless you.

00:41:00.181 --> 00:41:01.969
Thank you very much.

00:41:02.386 --> 00:41:07.648
Thank you very much.
