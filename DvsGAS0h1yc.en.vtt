00:06:57.852 --> 00:07:04.912
I am very happy that you all have decided, can you hear me?

00:07:10.802 --> 00:07:17.202
To get married in Sahaja Yoga, it looks very simple, 

00:07:17.346 --> 00:07:21.986
to decide like that, 

00:07:22.106 --> 00:07:26.086
but you must know it's a very big responsibility

00:07:26.232 --> 00:07:30.952
 because ours is a global movement 

00:07:31.046 --> 00:07:34.642
and the girls who are married are 

00:07:34.776 --> 00:07:37.276
from different cultures.

00:07:38.036 --> 00:07:42.066
They come from different cultures, with different education, 

00:07:42.116 --> 00:07:44.386
with different backgrounds 

00:07:45.016 --> 00:07:51.666
and you are also from different countries and different backgrounds.

00:07:53.996 --> 00:07:59.316
Now the understanding should be

00:07:59.706 --> 00:08:02.206
 that now you all have become global 

00:08:02.966 --> 00:08:07.416
and you follow one religion that is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma 

00:08:08.854 --> 00:08:11.744
and you have no other problems 

00:08:13.524 --> 00:08:20.264
as they have in other religions, marrying inter-religion, inter-national.

00:08:21.454 --> 00:08:23.014
We have no problems, 

00:08:23.145 --> 00:08:29.974
so we must take our marriages very much gladly 

00:08:30.194 --> 00:08:38.154
and should try to make it a great success.

00:08:40.024 --> 00:08:44.804
It's very easy to find faults with others 

00:08:45.084 --> 00:08:48.594
and go on fighting and do all kinds of things,

00:08:48.784 --> 00:08:52.984
 but it's even easier to love, to love someone, 

00:08:53.124 --> 00:08:58.854
enjoy someone and be in the company of someone.

00:08:59.044 --> 00:09:04.174
That's much easier and that's what you can do in Sahaja Yoga. 

00:09:04.774 --> 00:09:10.908
In Sahaja Yoga you'll have no problems in adjusting 

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:15.934
because you'll find 

00:09:16.034 --> 00:09:19.654
there are many other couples who are already married 

00:09:19.674 --> 00:09:23.244
and have achieved great success.

00:09:23.524 --> 00:09:26.694
That's how our Sahaja Yoga is spread all over. 

00:09:27.503 --> 00:09:34.663
We don't believe in all the artificial restrictions. 

00:09:35.963 --> 00:09:40.433
We are absolutely open, free 

00:09:40.703 --> 00:09:44.179
and we should love each other, 

00:09:46.599 --> 00:09:50.900
understand each other, show your love to each other,

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:56.510
show your affection in such a manner

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.230
 that another person understands. 

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:06.460
I found sometimes that, you see, Indian girls are little shy, they are brought up like that

00:10:07.358 --> 00:10:12.530
and suddenly if you become extremely 

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:20.140
lovable, I should say, they get a little frightened.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:25.280
So you must have some balance and understanding

00:10:25.454 --> 00:10:29.090
 because you are all older than your wives. 

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.920
So you have to make it a success. 

00:10:32.862 --> 00:10:38.702
Use your wisdom 

00:10:39.722 --> 00:10:44.522
and love and try to understand your wife.

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:49.140
She comes from a different culture.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.650
You are from a different culture.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.200
 If you understand that part, 

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:59.000
I think things will work out very well. 

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:04.610
There is nothing important than creating a good family for you,

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.570
 having good children.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:13.160
And we have so many now, you'll be happy to know 

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:19.010
that there are so many people living abroad, even in India, 

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:28.497
who are making a very good family, very sweet families.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:35.290
So there is always justice for you 

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.240
for doing this thing, so carefully working it out. 

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:44.750
That's the divine justice and that's how you are blessed.

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:50.600
I don't know what advice I should give you, 

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:55.300
but one thing I must say, it's all spontaneous. 

00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:01.630
If you go on thinking, making plans and going round and round,

00:12:01.833 --> 00:12:03.850
 it won't work out.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:09.730
Be spontaneous and let your wife also have that confidence about you,

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:15.530
 that you are a very much a Sahaja Yogi.

00:12:17.766 --> 00:12:22.476
So far we have had very, very few divorces 

00:12:23.206 --> 00:12:28.116
because of some certain, certain shocking things happened.

00:12:28.696 --> 00:12:34.576
 But in so many years we have hardly even ten divorces.

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:38.190
So sometimes it happens 

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:42.130
that in a hurry and scurry 

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.160
we have not been able 

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:50.420
to know everything and it has gone wrong.

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:54.530
 But compared to thousands, if there are ten divorces,

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.210
 it's alright.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.790
And very, very good marriages.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.540
 It's nice to see them,

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.130
 how they work together, how they love each other, 

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.820
don't find faults with each other

00:13:07.988 --> 00:13:10.488
 and appreciate each other.

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:16.730
Somehow it is due to your realization

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.680
 and your full growth of service. 

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:26.180
Whatever I may tell you, it is left to you. 

00:13:26.189 --> 00:13:31.890
You are [unclear]. How to work it out, to make a very successful marriage 

00:13:32.162 --> 00:13:34.930
and that gives me the greatest joy.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:38.680
If I see husband-wife fighting, I really feel very upset 

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:43.520
because you are Sahaja Yogis. You have a mission,

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.140
 you have a global mission 

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:52.206
and you have to have that special type of married life 

00:13:52.586 --> 00:13:55.086
which I desire for everyone.

00:13:55.406 --> 00:13:59.040
So you are all intelligent, you understand. 

00:13:59.226 --> 00:14:02.566
I leave it to you to find out the ways and methods 

00:14:02.924 --> 00:14:10.573
of expression of your family life as ideal one.

00:14:10.656 --> 00:14:13.156
 So may God bless you.
