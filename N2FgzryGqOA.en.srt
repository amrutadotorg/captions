1
00:00:06,767 --> 00:00:12,587
So these divisive methods have come through

2
00:00:12,787 --> 00:00:16,787
the innate humility not being you.

3
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,632
If you can enjoy each and everything,

4
00:00:20,843 --> 00:00:23,033
then you are humble.

5
00:00:25,576 --> 00:00:30,606
If you can appreciate each and every expression,

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,440
then you are humble.

7
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:43,562
This humility is a very deep-down character,

8
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:47,642
because from Mooladhara it comes.

9
00:00:50,946 --> 00:00:53,976
And that is what is Shri Ganesha.

10
00:00:54,507 --> 00:00:58,096
Just imagine, He has a little rat on which He moves about,

11
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:05,036
He doesn’t have Impala cars or Rolls Royces.

12
00:01:05,936 --> 00:01:08,875
He just moves, with all His big stomach

13
00:01:08,956 --> 00:01:12,146
He moves on a little rat.

14
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:21,369
No assertion of His powers – He’s so humble,

15
00:01:21,946 --> 00:01:25,026
He’s so sweet.

16
00:01:25,956 --> 00:01:30,176
And He’s the creator of all the rhythms and things and vibrations.

17
00:01:31,026 --> 00:01:36,166
Without Him, I don’t know what would be this world.

18
00:01:37,436 --> 00:01:43,476
And that’s what we have to really appreciate everywhere,

19
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:46,820
instead of denouncing this, that.

20
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:50,036
I mean, like even the color of this room you may not like,

21
00:01:50,117 --> 00:01:51,229
this you may not like.

22
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,328
I mean, there are so many things you don’t like.

23
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:57,439
Then I have to ask, “What do you like?”

24
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:00,809
“Baked beans” – all right!

25
00:02:10,016 --> 00:02:12,016
We have to open out ourselves.

26
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:17,036
With humility you open out, you penetrate, you spread.

27
00:02:17,156 --> 00:02:19,765
Without humility you cannot,

28
00:02:19,845 --> 00:02:25,046
because you are objecting to everything, creating a wall.

29
00:02:25,176 --> 00:02:30,976
Only the humility will make you spread out.

30
00:02:31,706 --> 00:02:35,586
Today, the first day of our tour,

31
00:02:36,595 --> 00:02:44,005
I would request you that you have to be very, very humble.

32
00:02:44,086 --> 00:02:50,006
Understand that humility is extremely simple,

33
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:52,976
and is beautiful.

34
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:56,844
You saw that little girl playing veena, such a difficult

35
00:02:56,925 --> 00:03:01,915
Adi Vadyam, primordial instrument, playing with such

36
00:03:01,996 --> 00:03:05,885
sweetness, with such deftness, and so humble.

37
00:03:05,966 --> 00:03:07,597
And she came to Me and she said,

38
00:03:07,678 --> 00:03:10,859
“Mother, what a privilege it was that I got

39
00:03:10,956 --> 00:03:14,166
the opportunity to play before You.”

40
00:03:15,476 --> 00:03:19,586
Just imagine – such a genius.

41
00:03:19,996 --> 00:03:23,847
Another one who met Me last time was a mandolin player

42
00:03:24,339 --> 00:03:27,309
about the same age, maybe younger.

43
00:03:27,936 --> 00:03:30,855
I mean, he is now world-renowned, but when he played

44
00:03:30,936 --> 00:03:33,977
before Me, wouldn’t accept any money, nothing,

45
00:03:34,058 --> 00:03:35,792
he just went into ecstasy.

46
00:03:35,873 --> 00:03:39,411
Even the dancer, she told Me she went into ecstasy

47
00:03:39,492 --> 00:03:40,945
when she saw Me,

48
00:03:41,026 --> 00:03:43,865
and she just danced so well with such vigor.

49
00:03:43,946 --> 00:03:45,786
And she – she had temperature.

50
00:03:45,867 --> 00:03:48,063
She said, “My temperature is gone, everything,

51
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,813
I am perfectly all right.”

52
00:03:52,006 --> 00:03:55,548
Look at those artists. I mean, they have never known Me,

53
00:03:55,629 --> 00:03:57,738
they don’t know anything about Sahaja Yoga.

54
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:02,078
But what a humble understanding of Divinity –

55
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,065
because they are humble.

56
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:09,616
Divinity never asserts itself, doesn’t propagate itself,

57
00:04:09,697 --> 00:04:12,657
doesn’t make a big sound.
