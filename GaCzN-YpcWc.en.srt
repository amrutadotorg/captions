1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:17,610
I talked to you about the Void in our body,
which is called as Bhavasagara [Hindi], Bhavasagara

2
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,670
in our Sahaja Yoga language.

3
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:29,030
Today we have to understand the other chakras,
which are above the Bhavasagara.

4
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:37,499
Last time I told you how by following wrong
gurus and spoiling your Guru principle you

5
00:00:37,499 --> 00:00:41,039
get problems in your stomach.

6
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:52,140
Also your extreme behavior towards religion,
your fanaticism, creates problems which may

7
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,199
go up to something like cancer.

8
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:07,800
Also, the another extreme behavior of people
who become very dry by their over-activity

9
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:16,360
on the right side and have no feelings for
the family and neglect the family, have no

10
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:25,110
relationship with their wives of a normal
nature, also may develop problems of the stomach.

11
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:37,900
This chakra I didn’t talk to you before,
about the speedometer within us, which is

12
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,890
the Nabhi.

13
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,180
I think I did mention something about it.

14
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:49,560
This is one of the most important chakras
within us and I think, before going over to

15
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,190
other chakras, I must say that how our spleen
gets spoilt and how we get into problems like

16
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,200
blood cancer, which is a very common disease
today in the West and is also invading our

17
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:09,520
country, with such a speed [Hindi].

18
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:19,140
This is a – I didn’t talk to you about
it but I have talked about this to other people.

19
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:27,230
Now this spleen is the one which creates blood
cells for our emergencies.

20
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,670
Any emergency comes in, it has to produce
new blood cells to fight the emergency or

21
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:37,750
to face the emergency or to solve the problems
of the emergency.

22
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:45,830
In the modern times, we have lost the idea
of controlling our speed.

23
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:54,650
We talk telescopically, we walk telescopically,
we arrive at a point so telescopically that

24
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,870
the point is left behind before we arrive.

25
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:06,040
Now this spleen is the one, when you are eating
your food, is also producing blood corpuscles

26
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,760
to fight or, you can say, to digest the food.

27
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:21,000
At the same time if you are listening to some
horrid news and horrible emergencies that

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,610
suddenly come up, or if you are reading newspapers,
or if you are running away to your office,

29
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:33,870
this is a very common thing with government
servants that they have no time for their

30
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,870
breakfast.

31
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:39,020
They will take one hour in the bathroom and
in five minutes, they want to finish their

32
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,020
breakfast.

33
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:47,489
All such persons face the problem of getting
into some sort of a complication of the spleen

34
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:53,580
because when you eat your food, and suddenly
try to run, the poor spleen has to go with

35
00:03:53,580 --> 00:04:01,849
a double speed to cope up with your additional
activities.

36
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:12,450
It used to be a style in olden days that all
the people would sit for food very comfortably

37
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:19,280
and the food was served with great care and
everybody was given sufficient time to eat

38
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,280
the food.

39
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:29,060
And there would be a lady to fan the gentleman
who would keep the pace of the man’s eating

40
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:37,700
process at a proper level, and the food would
be eaten with little leisure.

41
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:44,169
But nowadays I find that people have no sense
that we are human beings and we are not machines.

42
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:49,250
In Delhi, I feel the schools are really very
cruel people.

43
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:56,150
I find even in this winter season the children
have to go to school at 6.30 or 6 o’clock

44
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,340
in the morning.

45
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:02,280
And somebody must bring some legal procedure
against these schools.

46
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,070
Is absolutely essential, your children are
going to be in great difficulties if you do

47
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,500
not pay attention to this fact.

48
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:15,970
To get up early in the morning at that time,
then walk in the cold season, take your bath,

49
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:20,670
many people take their bath, also with hot
water, and then suddenly go out in that cold,

50
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:28,130
take your breakfast just in a standing manner,
in a very rushing manner, the mother is running

51
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:32,020
with a bottle in the hand, and pouring the
milk for the child, and the child is somehow

52
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,750
or other trying to gulp it down and taking
a bread in the hand and rushing about.

53
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:41,000
This is even worse than military, I can tell
you.

54
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,880
For such small children who are growing, it
is essential that they must have their breakfast

55
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:54,830
when they are quite in tune with the atmosphere,
not at the early in the morning at 6:30 to

56
00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:01,400
get up and rush them with their breakfast
is something extremely cruel that we are doing

57
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,690
to our children.

58
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:09,120
This will not only spoil their Vishuddhi – according
to, I think modern people, Vishuddhi trouble

59
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,200
is to be accepted all the time, means all
cold, coughs, and all that is a part of life,

60
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,540
you can’t complain about it, somehow it
has to go hand in hand with you.

61
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,040
They do not want to find solutions for that.

62
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:25,220
People might say in olden days, people used
to get up at 4 o’clock, all right, they

63
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,680
would.

64
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,680
But they never used to get out of their houses
so fast.

65
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,820
And the style of life was very different in
those days.

66
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:39,570
People had very good food to eat, they had
things full of vitamins, and the pressures

67
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,780
on their lives were much -, much less.

68
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,540
As it is we have no time to pay any attention
to our children.

69
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:51,420
On top of that, the way we hurry them up is
so dangerous, that I don’t know, I have

70
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:57,680
never known that children go so early in Delhi,
which is so freezingly cold, so early and

71
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,520
come back home at about 2:30 in the afternoon.

72
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:06,900
To come back at 2:30 in the afternoon, after
eating that hurried meal at home, or whatever

73
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,110
you may call a breakfast or whatever you may
call it, so called, and then come back at

74
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,509
2:30 and what are they going to eat?

75
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:16,360
There is timing for everything.

76
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,570
The food digestion takes about three hours
and children feel hungry.

77
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:25,539
As it is there is no food and this is how
about five and a half hours, you keep them

78
00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:28,180
away in the schools without any food for what?

79
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,400
What knowledge are you giving to your children?

80
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,280
What is the special knowledge you are giving
to your children?

81
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,210
What is such a great thing that the world
has achieved by having these institutions

82
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,919
of education, so called?

83
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:48,630
First of all you are creating children who
will be very sick.

84
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,889
It is not going to give them longevity.

85
00:07:51,889 --> 00:08:01,210
Secondly, the way the people rush about for
their work.

86
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,669
In the morning time, there is no need to rush
about.

87
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:10,169
If you can get up early in the morning, sleep
early and get up in the morning, take your

88
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:18,660
time and eat your breakfast properly and go
to office, have something in the afternoon,

89
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:24,560
and then in the evening, you’ll be amazed,
you will get over fifty percent of your sicknesses.

90
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:31,530
Because at the right time, if you give a proper
practice to your stomach, you get your juices

91
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,270
oozing out at the right time.

92
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,959
You don’t make your stomach crazy by that.

93
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,719
But, by this kind of emergency all the time
arising, listening to horrible things at the

94
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:50,470
time when you are eating your food or doing
something important, your spleen goes crazy.

95
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,740
It does not know.

96
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,910
It loses its power to produce proper blood
cells.

97
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,950
It does not know how to produce it, it really
becomes crazy and in that craziness, it starts

98
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:06,760
producing blood cells at odd hours, wrong
hours, it does not know when to produce, it

99
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,910
is always in emergency, it is never stationed
in its normal state.

100
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:18,959
At this stage, if there is an attack from
your collective subconscious area, about which

101
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:24,370
now doctors are now talking in England, that
there is an attack of some proteins unknown

102
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:32,230
to them, they call them as protein 58 and
all that, you are very much prone to get blood

103
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,790
cancer.

104
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:40,839
Moreover, if your attention is too much on
the left or the right to the extreme, you

105
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:42,170
are even more prone.

106
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:47,360
For example, you are a planner, you plan morning
till evening, so your attention is more on

107
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,440
the future.

108
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,410
That means your attention is on the right-hand
side.

109
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:55,060
It’s like a cloth you can say, the attention
in the stomach, is protruding to the right

110
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,320
or to the left.

111
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,620
Now, if your attention is too much on the
right, means you are planning all the time,

112
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,700
as I told you, doctors may not accept it,
but is a fact that when you think too much

113
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:14,760
and plan too much, your Nabhi or your Swadishthana
Chakra is converting the fat cells for the

114
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,400
use of the brain.

115
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:25,360
At that time, if you put more pressure into
it, by over-activity of the right-hand side,

116
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,010
which is your kriya shakti, it happens that
you may enter into it to such an extent that

117
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:37,790
at that time, if you have any such problem,
you are easy to get some problem with your

118
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:42,750
liver because it is on the right-hand side;
and the poor liver suffers, you get cyrrosis

119
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:49,500
of the liver or just like cancer of the liver.

120
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:55,940
Now, in Sahaja Yoga, what happens really is
this, your attention is spread like a cloth,

121
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:06,550
and when the Kundalini rises, She pushes your
attention upward and the attention is a sheath

122
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,550
around the Kundalini.

123
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:13,060
When She pierces the Brahmarandhra, then your
attention starts oozing out into the Supreme

124
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:21,029
or what we call the Super Consciousness, which
is here spread, into the sukshma, into the

125
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:22,430
subtle consciousness.

126
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:31,100
Your whole attention is pulled up there and
that is how you cure your blood cancer, your

127
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:40,149
liver cancer, and all the cancer that is connected
with this kind of attention.

128
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:47,180
Not only cancer but many other diseases, like
kidney trouble, liver trouble and all other

129
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:59,240
– we can say diabetes, intestinal troubles,
and even you might get relief to your diaphragm,

130
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,990
sometimes which is very much in tension with
people who are agitated all the time.

131
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:12,800
Those people who think they are important,
I think are really not aware of what importance

132
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,649
they have to themselves.

133
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:19,470
We must understand our own esteem, and we
must know that we are human beings, and that

134
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:23,329
we are very important to God if not to anybody
else.

135
00:12:23,329 --> 00:12:29,170
As human beings, we have to also realize that
we have come on this earth from amoeba stage

136
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:35,950
to this stage, and God has worked so hard
for us that we have no business to go on slashing

137
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:44,430
ourselves into absolutely ridiculous sick
people who are no good for God and no good

138
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,990
for anyone whatsoever.

139
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:54,870
Now, this attention is, how it is diverted
from this to that, can be seen that when people

140
00:12:54,870 --> 00:13:02,000
are very much right-handed or ego-oriented,
as we call it, they try to take their attention

141
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,860
away from their ego.

142
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:09,370
Actually those people who are very ego-oriented
always take to some kind of intoxication because

143
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,350
they just can’t sleep in the night.

144
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,550
Their attention so much is in the future that
they cannot sleep.

145
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:17,020
By sleep, they might go into the left side.

146
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,010
So they have to drink a lot.

147
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:22,260
They will have more alcohols than normal people
do.

148
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:27,350
They’ll have drugs or they’ll have some
sort of a thing, ultimately they have to take

149
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:31,240
sleeping pills, without sleeping pills they
cannot sleep.

150
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,980
The reason is, the attention in the man is
so disturbed, and he does not know how to

151
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:46,350
give it a proper chance to lead a normal existence
that this attention is always thinking, thinking,

152
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:52,320
thinking like mad and he does not know how
to stop that thinking.

153
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,260
In Sahaja Yoga, it happens automatically because
your attention goes beyond thinking.

154
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:05,360
You develop your thoughtless awareness without
any difficulties, but you do not establish

155
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,360
it.

156
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,839
You have to establish your thoughtless awareness
and for that, you have to work it out.

157
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:13,370
And that working out takes little time.

158
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:18,350
If people can really work it out properly,
they can never get into these troubles.

159
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:22,829
On the contrary, even if they may not be doctors,
or may not be physicians, they may be able

160
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:26,610
to cure other people who have this problem.

161
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:29,230
But in Sahaja Yoga, you must know that it’s
a new knowledge for you.

162
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:32,480
It was a secret knowledge before this, very
much a secret.

163
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,620
Of course, I must say Kabirdas and Guru Nanak
and Adi Shankaracharya and all these people

164
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,700
talked of Kundalini.

165
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:44,540
Gyaneshwara talked of Kundalini and he said
that this is this and this is that.

166
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:50,170
But they did not give a full detailed idea
about Sahaj Yog because it was useless to

167
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,550
tell them all about it when they were not
realized.

168
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:57,460
But they did inform because they knew that
this time was going to come when they will

169
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:02,470
be told about it and if they had not said
about this, they would have come up and said

170
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,399
that, “From where are you getting word Kundalini?

171
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,149
It is not written anywhere."

172
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:11,290
Because as I told yesterday in My lecture
that people have more faith in My photograph

173
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,610
that than in Myself.

174
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:18,870
Human beings are so funny that they believe
into something that is printed than what is

175
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,870
said.

176
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,579
Just now, I’m saying something to you.

177
00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:22,779
I’m standing before you.

178
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:25,780
But when I’m in the present, you do not
want to accept Me.

179
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,740
But if I have said something, and is printed,
you’ll say, “Yes."

180
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:35,010
I’ve seen also people who have My tapes,
they believe into My tapes than into My speeches

181
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,110
when I’m speaking to them.

182
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:41,980
It’s most surprising how a human mind rushes
off to the past or to the future.

183
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:49,570
This is a human nature which is always going
out, and it is the attention which is going

184
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:54,029
out because of a particular problem within
human beings.

185
00:15:54,029 --> 00:16:00,510
Now that problem I just cannot discuss because
I need little drawings for that which we don’t

186
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,510
have.

187
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:06,790
But I have got in some of My speeches I’ve
explained, why the attention of man goes out

188
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:10,769
– because of his prismatic nature of his
brain.

189
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:19,079
But that prismatic nature and the, I should
say, the dual density of his brain creates

190
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:22,310
a problem, by which the attention of man goes
out.

191
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:26,339
Now the attention [of] the man has to be sucked
in.

192
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:29,459
If I tell you, you pay attention to Me, you
can.

193
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:33,410
If I tell these children, “Pay attention
to Me”, they may for a while, but again

194
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,440
they’ll start playing.

195
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,760
So, if I tell them that “pay attention to
Me”, they will see Me and they’ll start

196
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,149
paying attention to Me.

197
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:44,839
But if I say, “Pay attention to yourself”,
you cannot pay.

198
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:49,680
You may say that, “All right, we are praying
inside, we are doing antar yoga, this that”

199
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,870
– is all a myth, it’s not there.

200
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:55,579
When the attention is inside, you are in the
present, you don’t think, you are in the

201
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:56,579
present.

202
00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:01,699
When the attention is outside, then either
you are on the left side or the right side,

203
00:17:01,699 --> 00:17:05,149
by which you are paying attention to your
past or to the future.

204
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:09,429
All your thoughts are coming from the past
and from the future.

205
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:11,769
At this present moment, there is no thought.

206
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:14,900
But this, to stop this, is very difficult.

207
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,919
To say now, you cannot do that.

208
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:22,100
There’s a space in between, which is called
Vilamba, which is achieved through Kundalini

209
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:28,199
awakening, it passes through the left and
right side of ego and superego, and in the

210
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:31,389
center you achieve your thoughtless awareness.

211
00:17:31,389 --> 00:17:40,859
Now, this process of Kundalini rising upward
can be hampered at a [level] – another chakra

212
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:48,529
which is at the heart level, in the center
in the spinal cord.

213
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:53,890
It is expressed outside in the sternum and
we can say that till the boy or the girl is

214
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:58,559
about twelve years of age, from the sternum
the anti-bodies are created, they go in the

215
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,440
whole body and spread there and fight the
diseases.

216
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:10,559
Now, these anti-bodies, in Sahaja Yoga language,
are the armies of the Jagadamba, of Durga,

217
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,850
of the Mother of this world.

218
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:19,049
She resides in this center according to Sahaja
Yoga language.

219
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:24,229
But it may be that people will not believe
into it, “How can that be that Durga resides

220
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:25,229
there?”

221
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,679
Somebody told Me it’s not written in the
book.

222
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:28,549
I said, “Thank God, it is not written."

223
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:33,380
Otherwise you would have never understood
it and you would have a mess of everything,

224
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:38,000
as you have done it of whatever was written
has been made into a rigmarole.

225
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:46,039
So now, this Goddess is in this center.

226
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:52,289
When this center is out of gear, first of
all your anti-bodies are reduced.

227
00:18:52,289 --> 00:18:57,789
There are so many medicines which reduce your
anti-bodies.

228
00:18:57,789 --> 00:19:03,100
But people take it because it gives them a
little relief for the time being.

229
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:08,309
But they become then prone to other diseases
because if the anti-bodies are reduced, then

230
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:13,639
you cannot find [may Shri Mataji mean “fight”?]
the other, other diseases and the strength

231
00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:14,639
is reduced.

232
00:19:14,639 --> 00:19:21,730
Now, in all our medicines, we forget that
we are a complete being, we are not just a

233
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:26,830
physical being, but emotional being, and also
a mental being, and above all, a spiritual

234
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,830
being.

235
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:33,519
Now when we forget this, we are only worried
about the physical side of it.

236
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:40,779
And when our physical side is in trouble,
we want to do everything under the sun; but

237
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:44,539
we do not know by doing that we are spoiling
our emotional side.

238
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:50,879
By spoiling our emotional side, it can be
very dangerous, that medicines, which reduce

239
00:19:50,879 --> 00:19:56,929
the anti-bodies in the body, can lead you
to madness, ultimately.

240
00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:01,660
First they give you giddiness, must you sleep
a lot, and after that too much sleeping, too

241
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,759
much of these medicines, can cause madness.

242
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:09,419
Because you are thrown into the left side
and you can be attacked and you can become

243
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:10,889
a mad person.

244
00:20:10,889 --> 00:20:16,789
So these medicines are so dangerous that people
without understanding the complete nature

245
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:20,279
of man just try to treat part of it.

246
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:27,529
In Sahaja Yoga we, as he said, I do not take
any medicines, My ….

247
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:32,619
as Kabira has said, “I do not take any medicines,
for me Parabrahma is the one who is my Vaidya,

248
00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:33,669
He treats me”.

249
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:39,820
And is a fact, now the time has come to prove
what Kabira has said, what Nanaka has said,

250
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,389
what Adi Shankaracharya has said, what Christ
has said.

251
00:20:43,389 --> 00:20:47,619
There is no need to take medicine to cure
this centre.

252
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:51,139
We spoil this centre by other means also.

253
00:20:51,139 --> 00:20:53,320
For example, if you…

254
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,409
there can be very simple reasons for spoiling
it.

255
00:20:56,409 --> 00:20:59,279
You take your bath with hot water.

256
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,559
Normally to take a hot bath – a hot bath
is all right, but that should be done in the

257
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,909
night when you don’t go out at all.

258
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:10,760
Then you sleep off, you are in the room and
there cannot be a problem.

259
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:15,960
But I’ve seen in England most of the Indians
who come and see Me have got trouble with

260
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,960
their lungs.

261
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,840
They have a problem with their lungs and sometimes
they get lung cancer very easily.

262
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,690
And what I found out that they take a very
hot bath like English people.

263
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,639
Actually English people take seldom their
baths.

264
00:21:28,639 --> 00:21:34,989
So [She laughs, general laughter] and it is
very common to see in English homes sixty

265
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:38,009
bedrooms with a bath, you see.

266
00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:40,639
Because they don’t require it much.

267
00:21:40,639 --> 00:21:42,460
But even if they have to take, they take it
in the night.

268
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,739
[Laughter] They don’t take it early in the
morning like Indians do.

269
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:49,809
You see, you have to live in England the way
English are – and not that, you cannot live

270
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:57,340
like that, is a bit too much [laughter] – but
still you can sometimes understand that if

271
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:02,460
you have to take the bath early in the morning,
and then go to office, you are definite to

272
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:07,809
catch this centre or a centre next to that
which is called as right heart in our Sahaja

273
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:09,610
Yoga language.

274
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:16,529
Now this center heart is caught, or the right
heart is caught, because you suddenly expose

275
00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:19,489
yourself to cold weather.

276
00:22:19,489 --> 00:22:24,220
In the same way in Delhi you may catch it,
that you just have your hot bath and get out

277
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,039
into the cold.

278
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:33,460
Now best thing is that you take your hot bath
always, and then allow the water to be mixed

279
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:40,889
with cold water, make the tap run and then
you take your bath, end up with cool water.

280
00:22:40,889 --> 00:22:45,059
You’ll be amazed you will never catch cold.

281
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:47,740
Is a very simple thing to do.

282
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:51,320
Once you practice this, you will never catch
cold.

283
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:58,600
I have seen people living very near Himalayas
where it’s absolutely very, very cold twelve

284
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,600
months.

285
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:08,450
They always take their baths early in the
morning sitting outside with cold water.

286
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:11,080
They never take bath with hot water.

287
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,279
They never have hot water to take their bath.

288
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:19,940
And I’ve not seen any person suffering from
this cold in the hills.

289
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:24,340
They keep very good health as far as the cold
is concerned despite the fact it is very cold.

290
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:30,039
It’s a matter of little habit, if the sahaj
yogis who are realized souls, if they practice

291
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:34,950
this, I tell you all your Vishuddhis which
are so horribly caught up will be all right

292
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:38,970
and I will have less trouble [laughter, She
laughs].

293
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:43,710
Because today I was clearing everybody’s
Vishuddhi there.

294
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:49,279
Now this right-side heart is caught up, is
most surprising that it is caught up, because

295
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:56,190
it is the, it is bestowed upon by the deity
of Shri Rama.

296
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:58,460
Shri Rama is the Father deity.

297
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:08,359
He is the Father, he is the Father king and
he is the Father of this world, is the Father

298
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,359
head.

299
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:12,840
Supposing you are a bad father, you will catch
this.

300
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:18,049
Ultimately, with this center you always get
asthma, always.

301
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:23,090
All asthma patients who have come to Me have
been cured – so far.

302
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:27,889
I have cured most of the ailments of right
heart.

303
00:24:27,889 --> 00:24:33,520
There is another cause of this is, supposing
somebody’s father is dead in early years,

304
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:39,969
very early years when the child was not yet
properly settled down, or he died at a time

305
00:24:39,969 --> 00:24:45,739
with an accident or may be with a worry about
the child.

306
00:24:45,739 --> 00:24:46,759
Then he haunts the child.

307
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:48,129
This is true.

308
00:24:48,129 --> 00:24:54,950
At that time, if you just tell your father
that “I’m all right, don’t worry, you

309
00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:00,799
take your birth, I’ll be all right”, you’ll
be amazed, this asthma can go.

310
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:07,879
There was a governor of Kashmir, who was a
very, very respectable man and we had gone

311
00:25:07,879 --> 00:25:11,519
to him as state guests.

312
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:18,010
One morning he came walking barefeet in Kashmir
to our guesthouse, I was amazed why he was

313
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,010
walking down.

314
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,220
So went down to see him.

315
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:24,110
He said, “Today I’ve come to see You as
a Mother and not as Mrs.

316
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,299
Shrivastava.

317
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:30,779
And I have come to ask You for one boon that
I’ve had this asthma for twenty-five years

318
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,509
and can You cure me?”.

319
00:25:32,509 --> 00:25:34,559
And it was cured in five minutes flat.

320
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,690
It’s that simple.

321
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:43,050
If you take the name of Shri Rama, if Nanaka
says is all right or if Kabira does is all

322
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:48,349
right, but if you unauthorized way if you
go on pestering Shri Ram for everything, then

323
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:50,379
also this chakra can be caught.

324
00:25:50,379 --> 00:25:56,109
Those people who believe in Hanumana, also
if they go on too much with it, it can be

325
00:25:56,109 --> 00:25:57,109
caught.

326
00:25:57,109 --> 00:26:04,450
Hanumana is the deity for your air, for your
breathing, and when you try to suffocate Hanumana

327
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:11,469
within you, you get the trouble of His disappearing
from that center, or you can say He sleeps

328
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:17,479
and you get these two troubles of – one
is asthma and also sometimes you might get

329
00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:18,479
choking.

330
00:26:18,479 --> 00:26:23,039
Suddenly, people, some people when they are
talking, suddenly they choke up.

331
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:30,649
Now this, this is very easy to cure, very,
very easy to cure asthma can be cured very

332
00:26:30,649 --> 00:26:31,649
easily.

333
00:26:31,649 --> 00:26:39,009
But the center heart when it is in problem
it can be with anything.

334
00:26:39,009 --> 00:26:46,479
We have here a patient who was doing this
Santoshi Mata’s vrat and she got this trouble.

335
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:49,549
Now Santoshi Mata, there’s nothing like
that.

336
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:50,549
It’s absurd!

337
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:54,720
Any Santoshi Mata is created by some cinema
fellow and all the women are doing this and

338
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,729
they are fasting on Friday.

339
00:26:56,729 --> 00:27:01,019
If you fast on Friday in the name of the Goddess,
you can fast if you want to, but not in the

340
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:06,289
name of Goddess – you are definite to catch
this thing because that is the day when She

341
00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:07,289
was born.

342
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:11,019
Friday is the day as regarded as the day of
the Goddess.

343
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:14,010
And that day one has to celebrate it instead
of fasting.

344
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:18,341
Apart from that, when you start taking Her
name morning till evening every time, She

345
00:27:18,341 --> 00:27:21,389
gets fed up of you and She disappears from
there.

346
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:24,389
She just doesn’t like you and you might
develop a big problem.

347
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:27,219
She is the One who gives you sense of security.

348
00:27:27,219 --> 00:27:28,729
She is the One She gives you sense of security.

349
00:27:28,729 --> 00:27:33,149
When your sense of security is disturbed,
then you get the catch on this one.

350
00:27:33,149 --> 00:27:38,460
For example, the women who suffer from, say,
breast cancer are only doing so because of

351
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:42,269
this, because She is the Great Mother and
as a mother, you suffer.

352
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:46,309
Supposing a husband is a bad man and a flirt,
and the woman thinks he is not all right.

353
00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:52,149
It is important for man to console his wife
and see that she has complete faith in her

354
00:27:52,149 --> 00:27:53,149
security.

355
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:57,929
But specially in India we try to make our
women extremely insecure by the way we talk

356
00:27:57,929 --> 00:27:59,609
to them, the way we treat them.

357
00:27:59,609 --> 00:28:06,210
I mean, we are extremely cruel people as far
as our wives are concerned.

358
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:11,799
Because I have seen people here, we have such
a big dowry system and all sorts of systems

359
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:14,580
in all our horrible customs and castes.

360
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:21,229
If a daughter is there, then there’s all
weakness for her, but the wife is also a daughter

361
00:28:21,229 --> 00:28:23,070
of somebody else, nobody thinks.

362
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:27,259
They will say if the wife asks for anything,
“Go and ask your father.

363
00:28:27,259 --> 00:28:30,059
Why didn’t he give it in the marriage?”

364
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:33,049
There is no fondness for the wife.

365
00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:35,999
There’s no understanding that she is the
one who is to be loved.

366
00:28:35,999 --> 00:28:37,799
She is to be given all the security.

367
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:42,879
And we put all kinds of insecurities into
her, we shout at her, some… so many people

368
00:28:42,879 --> 00:28:45,070
also beat their wives.

369
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:49,789
In England, invariably men beat their wives,
surprisingly supposed to be very educated,

370
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:50,789
sophisticated people.

371
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:53,639
The more sophisticated they are, the worse
they are.

372
00:28:53,639 --> 00:28:55,789
Not only they beat their wives, but they kill
their children.

373
00:28:55,789 --> 00:28:57,820
Every week two children are killed in England.

374
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,710
And we are going the same way.

375
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:04,729
I tell you I had never known people who used
to beat their wives when I was a child or

376
00:29:04,729 --> 00:29:05,729
when I was grown up.

377
00:29:05,729 --> 00:29:09,679
I have seen My father that he always respected
My mother very much.

378
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:14,289
But nowadays I find that husbands have no
respect for the wife at all.

379
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:18,219
They think they are very great people even
if they are clerks or anything they think

380
00:29:18,219 --> 00:29:19,419
the wife is a peon.

381
00:29:19,419 --> 00:29:26,940
If the husband is a peon he thinks the wife
is a jamadar [laughter].

382
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,559
If he is the jamadar I don’t know what he
must be thinking his wife to be.

383
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:37,830
And this kind of mythical complexes that human
beings have developed, women develop this

384
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:42,139
kind of a trouble, specially when men are
flirts.

385
00:29:42,139 --> 00:29:48,289
You see, when men start looking out for other
women it upsets women; it upsets their sense

386
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:49,289
of security.

387
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:50,919
She is the mother of your children.

388
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:56,249
She feels that any day she is challenged and
any days she’ll be insulted, she is a mother

389
00:29:56,249 --> 00:29:58,929
and as your children’s mother, she must
be respected.

390
00:29:58,929 --> 00:30:04,859
If she is not respected, she is absolutely
prone to this kind of a sense of insecurity

391
00:30:04,859 --> 00:30:09,259
in which she might develop this breast cancer.

392
00:30:09,259 --> 00:30:12,710
And this breast cancer is a very serious disease,
as you know.

393
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:16,119
We have cured many people from breast cancer.

394
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:19,909
Many people have been cured of breast cancer
and the relationship between husband and wife

395
00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:21,219
has improved after that.

396
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:24,830
But while she gets breast cancer, then you
should see the husband.

397
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:29,349
He gets absolutely upset, he does not know
what to do because Indian husbands do not

398
00:30:29,349 --> 00:30:35,869
know how to cook even, they do not know even
how to buy a vegetable, they don’t know

399
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:37,059
what are different dhals are.

400
00:30:37,059 --> 00:30:38,779
They don’t know any work whatsoever in the
house.

401
00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:43,919
They are not like English husbands or any
Western husbands, and some of the Western

402
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,269
people told me that Indian men are cowards.

403
00:30:46,269 --> 00:30:49,080
They cannot take a divorce because they don’t
know how to cook [laughter].

404
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:59,269
So, this is the condition of our Indian men,
they are entirely dependant on their wives

405
00:30:59,269 --> 00:31:04,259
for everything, still they try to dominate
their women so much; and I’m speaking in

406
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:09,039
English, I’m sorry I have to say this but
it is the case.

407
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:16,830
And when, you see, the women, when they find
men behaving like this, they become tigresses.

408
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:21,399
Some of them become such horrible tigresses
that they can ruin not only the family but

409
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:26,489
families after families and nations after
nations.

410
00:31:26,489 --> 00:31:32,289
You are creating a woman who is challenging
you and then once she starts challenging – and

411
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:37,789
the result of that I have seen that in England
or in any other such country, France, Germany,

412
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:39,070
Germany specially.

413
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:44,070
In Germany women are hitlerish, absolutely
hitlerish, men shake before them [laughter].

414
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:48,499
Absolutely, they are just like ghatis, you
see, in the hamals, working in the house.

415
00:31:48,499 --> 00:31:52,220
The woman stands with her both hand on her
hips and she says, “You haven’t cleaned

416
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,220
this.

417
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,499
You haven’t done this, what have you been
doing?

418
00:31:54,499 --> 00:31:57,039
This is not clean."

419
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:02,099
They have to clean all the utensils in the
house, everything, they have to keep the kitchen

420
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:07,499
absolutely sparklingly clean, otherwise the
men would be scolded on, “You don’t know

421
00:32:07,499 --> 00:32:08,499
how to keep it clean?

422
00:32:08,499 --> 00:32:10,129
Better go and learn from your neighbor."

423
00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:16,799
And poor neighbors consult each other and
do their homework [laughter].

424
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:24,909
Moreover the laws are such, they have passed
such laws that when the wife divorces a husband,

425
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:30,109
she gets half of the property, half of the
income of the husband, as long as she does

426
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:31,109
not marry.

427
00:32:31,109 --> 00:32:34,009
For example, a man is living in a huge big
place.

428
00:32:34,009 --> 00:32:38,759
Suddenly his wife decides to divorce – decides,
there’s no reason needed for that.

429
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:44,359
If she decides to divorce, then they get a
divorce, and the house is to be sold, and

430
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:46,029
the money is to be given half, half.

431
00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:47,029
[Laughter]

432
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:51,299
Then if such a wife marries twice or thrice,
she is a rich lady while this man is a pauper

433
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:52,299
[laughter].

434
00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:53,299
This is a very common sight.

435
00:32:53,299 --> 00:33:04,659
I have seen this very common in America specially,
that she says that he was my husband, he looks

436
00:33:04,659 --> 00:33:14,269
like a chauffeur, and this lady is going in
such big Cadillacs and all that, with a [laughter]

437
00:33:14,269 --> 00:33:18,960
– I wouldn’t say cigarette, it’s more
than that [laughter] – and with a stick

438
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,509
in the hand, you see, very smart.

439
00:33:21,509 --> 00:33:28,019
And while the husband is all tattered and
torn, and working as a chauffeur somewhere.

440
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:31,879
So, that another extreme is also horrid.

441
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:39,659
A woman is not to be like that, she has to
be a decent gracious personality and she is

442
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:44,429
not to take up this challenge, it’s not
wise to take these challenges from men.

443
00:33:44,429 --> 00:33:50,549
At least, Indian women know that, most of
them know, I hope so, they will keep it up.

444
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:53,940
But the men must understand now that they
have to respect women.

445
00:33:53,940 --> 00:34:00,109
If they do not respect their women, then the
daughters that they have, will be coming out

446
00:34:00,109 --> 00:34:05,039
like that and they’ll show such results
that you’ll be shocked.

447
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,469
One day they may even slap their father on
the face.

448
00:34:07,469 --> 00:34:11,500
It is quite possible, all such things can
happen in this country also.

449
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,789
So one has to be careful.

450
00:34:12,789 --> 00:34:19,620
Now I’ve said it because these two centers
are very important, Shri Rama, who is the

451
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:24,379
deity of Maryadas, of boundaries, how a human
being must live.

452
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:32,889
All His life, He never showed any special
interest in giving realization to people.

453
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:39,179
But – of course, He destroyed Ravana and
He destroyed many rakshasas.

454
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:48,440
But main message of His life is a life of
a dedicated husband, who loved His wife very

455
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:55,779
much and a man who sacrificed His beloved
for the sake of His being a good king.

456
00:34:55,779 --> 00:35:04,270
But just the other way round you find, in
this country where we think love is great

457
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:09,940
– here, I’ve known of many Ministers whose
wives rule the family.

458
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:15,900
Take, sacrifice is not there, on the contrary,
the wives are so important that they can make

459
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:21,859
the husbands just sit in the corner and nobody
says anything about it.

460
00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:29,150
But I have also known even worse cases where
the whole country is sold in the name of their

461
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,150
children.

462
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:32,450
It is such a serious thing.

463
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:37,839
We do not understand that these children are
not something that are going to carry your

464
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:46,890
name, but what is going to carry your name
is your own worth, is your own style, is in

465
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:47,890
your own character, and your own leadership.

466
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:53,910
Nobody is going to be bothered who is the
one who is your son or who is your daughter

467
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,589
or who is who.

468
00:35:55,589 --> 00:36:03,359
So those people who try such things, to think
that their children and their children or

469
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:08,760
– children are so important, then they should
realize that it was Shri Rama who sacrificed

470
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:17,140
His beloved, when She was pregnant and He
led a life of an ascetic remembering His wife.

471
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:22,819
This sacrifice was too much for Shri Ram because
He really loved Her, really, could not exist

472
00:36:22,819 --> 00:36:24,920
without Her, it was too much.

473
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,220
And then at a time when it comes to, Sita
also left Him.

474
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,630
And She left Him in Her own grace and in Her
own grandeur.

475
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:36,900
She didn’t allow Him to touch His body and
She just disappeared, like a woman has to

476
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,900
do.

477
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,000
While in the modern times, it is not so.

478
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,109
If the husband has harmed you, then the women
will go to the courts, she’ll put him in

479
00:36:44,109 --> 00:36:48,500
the jail and she will see that he is punished
nicely.

480
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,500
Why?

481
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,500
Because he was busy with other women.

482
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,750
Now, what I’m saying, if you think that
you love your husband and that’s why you

483
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:57,520
are angry that he should have nothing to do
with other women, why should you put him in

484
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,520
the jail?

485
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,310
Why should you trouble him and torture him?

486
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:06,590
So we have to realize that husband and wife
relationship is extremely important for sahaja

487
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,590
yogis.

488
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,950
You are the complements of each other.

489
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:12,690
If the relationship is not all right, Sahaja
Yoga does not work out.

490
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:20,029
It is not that a woman becomes so dominant,
but it is the complement, the love between

491
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,799
the two, the beauty of love, and the understanding.

492
00:37:22,799 --> 00:37:27,260
You need not even smile at your husband, you
need not even, when he is going – you see,

493
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:32,619
in England I have seen or anywhere else I
have seen, people will be all the time kissing

494
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:36,470
each other and doing all kinds of gestures
to show that they love.

495
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:37,470
And if you ask them, “Where are you going?”

496
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:39,769
– Even on an escalator you’ll find them
like that.

497
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:42,559
And if you ask them where are they going they
will say that, “Just now we are going for

498
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:43,559
a divorce case."

499
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:44,559
[Laughter]

500
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:50,930
The show is not needed, but from the heart,
you must feel that oneness with your husband

501
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:57,549
and that love for him and the husband must
feel that love; and it’s the only relationship,

502
00:37:57,549 --> 00:37:59,859
it’s the only, believe Me, which is the
most beautiful.

503
00:37:59,859 --> 00:38:05,010
The relationship with your children, you will
understand when they will earn, with your

504
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:08,299
daughter she will understand when they are
married.

505
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:11,539
With your parents also, when they are grown
up, you are grown up you have your wife, you’ll

506
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:15,329
find there will be a – you’ll find their
conceit coming up.

507
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:22,329
But the relationship with your wife is the
most private and the most treasured relationship

508
00:38:22,329 --> 00:38:26,789
and that’s why people have sung so many
poems about it and so many things.

509
00:38:26,789 --> 00:38:34,700
In Indian language, the – we have a certain
law about even writing.

510
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:39,540
Whatever is not hitakari is not accepted because
it is called as Sahitya.

511
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:47,400
Sahitya means Saha Hita, the one which gives
you Hita to your Atma is the only Sahitya.

512
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:53,690
The literature is Sahitya, whichever is not
is not literature, is trash.

513
00:38:53,690 --> 00:39:00,559
And in Sanskrit language Shringara which is
not with your wife, is not a Shringar, is

514
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:01,559
ashleela.

515
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:04,599
It has to be with your wife or to whom you
are engaged to.

516
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:09,310
And it is such a pure thing, is such a pure
thing.

517
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:14,279
And if people can understand how to enjoy
that purity, they will become themselves pure

518
00:39:14,279 --> 00:39:18,480
and they will have the best essence of it.

519
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,240
You see, when it comes to buying something,
we want pure silk, we want pure diamond, we

520
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,540
want pure gold.

521
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:29,380
But when it comes to our love, we want to
have all kinds of mixed-up impurities, perversions.

522
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,730
And then we say, “Oh, I got tired.

523
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:33,730
I cannot enjoy”.

524
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:34,750
Because it’s not pure!

525
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:39,160
The purity of that relationship must be enjoyed.

526
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:44,320
In Sahaja Yoga we don’t believe in sannyasa,
as I told you and there should be no sannyasa

527
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,640
now, because there are many great souls who
want to be born on this earth and we have

528
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,160
to make arrangements for them.

529
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:56,380
We have to have people who are happily married,
who respect each other, love each other, so

530
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:01,280
that the great saints can be born here.

531
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:09,500
In this relation, I would say a very interesting
talk that I had with a BBC fellow who came

532
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,500
to interview Me.

533
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,990
And he was, as usual, they are very sarcastic
and they think they are very smart.

534
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:18,000
They did not know they were meeting a smarter
person [laughter].

535
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,690
First he said to Me that, “How is it You
are here and doing so much for us, but why

536
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,890
don’t You go and help Indians who are so
poor?”

537
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:34,010
I said, “I’m sorry Sir, I’m in England
and I’m on your soil, I shouldn’t say

538
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:38,270
this, it’s not gracious for Me to say, but
you have asked such a question, I must answer

539
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,270
it.

540
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:43,529
With full apologies, I must say: who is responsible
for the poverty of India?”

541
00:40:43,529 --> 00:40:44,529
[Laughter]

542
00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:45,630
And he kept quiet.

543
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:50,309
Then he came out with second question, you
see, very smart fellow.

544
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:55,130
He said that “But, what do You think of
the population problem of India?

545
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:57,079
We are so much worried about it.

546
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:00,299
Why don’t You look after the population
problem of Your India?”

547
00:41:00,299 --> 00:41:03,819
“Of course I’m in England, I would have
never been there, I’m only there because

548
00:41:03,819 --> 00:41:04,950
My husband is there."

549
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:09,910
But I said, “Really, I’m sorry that this
is in India, but what to do?

550
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,160
There’s no solution for it."

551
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,210
He said, “Are we also responsible for that?”

552
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:15,720
I said, “I’m sorry to say, very much so."

553
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,720
[Laughter]

554
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,930
He said, “How are we responsible for your
population problem?”

555
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:25,349
I said, “The trouble is, you see, the people
who are taking birth have to decide, who will

556
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:26,720
take birth in this England?

557
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:40,059
[Laughter and applause] There two children
every week are killed by the parents for nothing

558
00:41:40,059 --> 00:41:46,640
at all, where the children are legal, everything
– who, which foolish man will take birth

559
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,660
here [laughter] except for people who are
of a very high grade – spirituality, you

560
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:56,039
don’t bother about these things [She laughs];
or only the rakshasas who will come and hit

561
00:41:56,039 --> 00:42:00,309
their parents and that’s what they are doing
today.

562
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,880
They are treating you well, the way you are
parents, and you don’t know what to do with

563
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,880
them”.

564
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:08,069
And this is what it is I have to tell you
that unless and until we really respect our

565
00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:13,859
wives and give them proper attention and proper
help, the discipline of this country is not

566
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:14,859
going to improve.

567
00:42:14,859 --> 00:42:19,170
It is she who disciplines the children, is
important to give her a complete sense of

568
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,400
security.

569
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:26,839
And the conceit of man has to go away, that
he thinks he’s very important, he’s not.

570
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:31,670
It is both, if they are together, then the
whole unit is important, you can’t live

571
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,769
with one eye, you have to have both the eyes.

572
00:42:33,769 --> 00:42:38,660
If one eye thinks he is more important, that
means one eye should disappear to see what

573
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,140
happens without [laughter].

574
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:46,759
After these, we come to another center, which
is extremely important in Sahaja Yoga called

575
00:42:46,759 --> 00:42:50,460
as Vishuddhi chakra, which is placed behind
this part.

576
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:53,390
Now it is not an exact position in every human
being.

577
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:58,280
It’s little lower, higher, so one should
not say that this is at this point.

578
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,480
Because we have to understand, this I’m
talking about the living process.

579
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,960
You can put dead things at the exact position,
at the exact date.

580
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,980
But can you say that the tree will grow in
this form, can you say before the tree is

581
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:12,980
grown?

582
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:13,980
It will take its own form.

583
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,760
Can you say the roots will grow like that?

584
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,050
Can you say so many, exactly so many flowers
will be there?

585
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:22,339
Or exactly so many flowers will become fruits?

586
00:43:22,339 --> 00:43:23,339
You cannot say.

587
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:27,940
Can you say at this time, at this hour, at
this moment, the flower is going to become

588
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,420
the fruit?

589
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:39,000
So, in the same way, you cannot say exactly
about Sahaja Yoga that where is this particular

590
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
center is placed.

591
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,160
Is above that.

592
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,170
You have to feel it, the vibrations, and you
can make it out that in some person it’s

593
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:47,230
slightly higher, in some person it is lower.

594
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:52,690
But why it is so important is this center
is that this denotes our real evolution into

595
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:53,690
a human being.

596
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:59,579
When the man raised his head up like that,
this center developed into us by which we

597
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:03,380
developed this ego and superego within us.

598
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:09,109
How this has happened is another big lecture
[She laughs] for which I would request you

599
00:44:09,109 --> 00:44:14,730
to read something on “Advent” or something
like that where it is little bit explained,

600
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:21,130
how the awareness of man when he raised his
head like this that his ego started developing,

601
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:27,089
and when he raised it like that it started
dominating its superego or its mana.

602
00:44:27,089 --> 00:44:34,700
This development within human beings is so
important because at this time, here, resides

603
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,509
Shri Krishna.

604
00:44:36,509 --> 00:44:40,130
Shri Krishna is sampurna.

605
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:46,460
It’s called as sixteen-petalled, sampurna,
complete incarnation.

606
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:51,690
And sixteen petals are expressed as sixteen
sub-plexuses in cervical plexus.

607
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:56,680
The cervical plexus looks after the gross
side of the face and the nose and the eyes

608
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:03,200
and the ears and the throat.

609
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:10,339
And – but the subtler side of this center
is very important, which is the left side,

610
00:45:10,339 --> 00:45:12,130
is the sub-conscious side.

611
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:20,400
And in the left side is the person who feels
very guilty or a person who has not proper

612
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,779
understanding of pure relationships of other
women or other men.

613
00:45:25,779 --> 00:45:30,109
Such a person develops this, in his left side.

614
00:45:30,109 --> 00:45:34,890
Now one may say that what’s wrong in all
these perverted relationships with others,

615
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:36,380
and what goes wrong with us.

616
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,930
You see, in the West specially, people believe
that you can have any kind of relationship

617
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:43,390
with anyone, no age, nothing, and they quite
boast of it.

618
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:47,280
I mean, it’s such a funny thing sometimes,
when I first went there, I had no idea that

619
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,420
they were that extent they were mad.

620
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:54,359
Because the first thing, in those days, when
I reached there was, the first thing on the

621
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:59,890
page was love letter by an eighty-year-old
lady to an eighteen-year-old boy [laughter].

622
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:04,420
And it was written, every his love letter
was there.

623
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:09,420
And this love letter became such a headache
to Me, I could not understand how could these

624
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:16,720
people think of such horrible things and write
such letters and publish them in the papers.

625
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:21,359
And this kind of madness, if you have, if
you do not have the sense of purity about

626
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:24,029
the relationship with others, you develop
this left Vishuddhi.

627
00:46:24,029 --> 00:46:27,330
With the left Vishuddhi, you develop lots
of problems.

628
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:33,670
With your tobacco and smoking also you develop
sometimes left Vishuddhi and also right Vishuddhi.

629
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:40,609
When left Vishuddhi is developed too much,
then you will find a man when he speaks, he

630
00:46:40,609 --> 00:46:47,400
stammers, his face is always going into contortions,
his body is doing like this, noses, you will

631
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,400
find all the Americans do like that.

632
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,859
Like this they will be moving [laughter],
there will be nervousness on the face and

633
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:54,309
they would not be normal people.

634
00:46:54,309 --> 00:46:56,970
The thing is their left Vishuddhi is in a
problem.

635
00:46:56,970 --> 00:47:03,560
As we say the pishani, this forehead is absolutely
wrinkled up and they have big, big furrows

636
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,009
at a very young age.

637
00:47:05,009 --> 00:47:10,859
Because I was amazed that some woman who was
only thirty years of age, half of My age,

638
00:47:10,859 --> 00:47:15,089
had such furrows and I thought she was an
old lady, I was very respectful to her, I

639
00:47:15,089 --> 00:47:18,539
got up, gave her My seat and all that and
I was standing up.

640
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:19,539
[Laughter]

641
00:47:19,539 --> 00:47:22,140
And after some time, she said, “Thank You
very much, very kind of You” and all that

642
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:25,799
and she asked Me – somehow I asked her,
“What are you doing?”

643
00:47:25,799 --> 00:47:27,490
She said, “I’m still studying, doing PhD."

644
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:28,510
I said ,”What?

645
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:29,520
[Laughter] Still studying?

646
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,540
What’s your age?”

647
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:31,550
She said, “Thirty."

648
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:32,570
I said, “Really?

649
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:35,410
Will you please get up?

650
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:37,500
I have to sit down."

651
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,119
[Laughter and applause, She laughs]

652
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:49,940
I mean, there the criteria of health is to
be just like mosquitoes, you see, the trouble

653
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:51,869
is they have to be like mosquitoes.

654
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:57,740
And as it is, they must remain very thin just
like as we call in Hindi, haddimarka.

655
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:03,730
And on top of that they wear high heels, you
see, and walk just like, what you call, like

656
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:06,690
spiders [laughter] you see, from here to there,
and you don’t know where they’ll put their

657
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:07,809
foot onto you [laughter].

658
00:48:07,809 --> 00:48:10,430
And that is regarded as a beauty there.

659
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:17,390
And so surprising that at a very young age
they start looking so very old that this mistake

660
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:19,490
can be done by many of us.

661
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:24,299
Moreover, the another problem comes of left
Vishuddhi, when people do not have proper

662
00:48:24,299 --> 00:48:26,519
sense of womanhood and manhood.

663
00:48:26,519 --> 00:48:32,019
Is very common in England and other countries,
Western countries, like America is much worse,

664
00:48:32,019 --> 00:48:34,319
you cannot make out a man from a woman.

665
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:42,069
You see, the women dress up just like horses,
they walk like horses [laughter], I mean,

666
00:48:42,069 --> 00:48:45,781
the whole thing is so funny that, you see,
this is big problem for us how to address!

667
00:48:45,781 --> 00:48:51,920
And sometimes it happens like this, that in
a meeting, I forget all the time that this

668
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,849
is a man, I always go on saying “She."

669
00:48:53,849 --> 00:48:54,849
Then he: “He”.

670
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:55,980
Then they say, “No, this is a man."

671
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:58,970
I remember then this is a man, it’s such
a problem!

672
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:06,069
One day, we were going by car, My husband
and Myself we asked ourselves, “Do you think

673
00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:08,260
the person who is going in the other car is
a man or a woman?”

674
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:09,369
I said, “Now”…

675
00:49:09,369 --> 00:49:12,150
Then our car went ahead, still we looked back,
he said, “I can’t say."

676
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,059
I said, “I can’t say."

677
00:49:14,059 --> 00:49:15,059
[She laughs]

678
00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:20,430
So, I asked our driver, who is an Englishman,
he looked back he said, “Madam, we are sorry,

679
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:24,299
I’m also sorry, I’m a foreigner, I don’t
know."

680
00:49:24,299 --> 00:49:25,299
[Laughter]

681
00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:31,119
So this kind of perverted attitude, to behave
like this – you see, you are a man, behave

682
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:34,460
like a man, if you are a woman, behave like
a woman.

683
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:40,630
If you start behaving like a man, or a woman
behaving like a man and a man behaving like

684
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:44,700
a woman, you see, you must understand your
muscles are made the way you are.

685
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,750
For example, a man can do lot of work which
women cannot do.

686
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:52,200
There is no need to be like Russian women
who are doing the, what you call, road-rollers,

687
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,450
they are driving or whatever it is.

688
00:49:54,450 --> 00:50:00,170
You see, they say that Russian women can do
this, but I tell you Russians, I do not want

689
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:07,249
to say much, but only thing I know that when
they shake hands, you know all your hand goes

690
00:50:07,249 --> 00:50:08,249
out.

691
00:50:08,249 --> 00:50:11,839
[Laughter, She laughs] Fall out [unclear].

692
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:16,579
That’s all I know, I know from the shake
hands, you see, we have sometimes to shake

693
00:50:16,579 --> 00:50:17,579
hands with many people.

694
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:20,349
I mean, Australians also are quite capable
[laughter].

695
00:50:20,349 --> 00:50:27,470
When Australians shake your hands, you can
be sure that, at least, if not much, but at

696
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:32,390
least some ounces are lost.

697
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:33,390
[Laughter]

698
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:38,790
Now, this is the thing is that men have to
be men and women have to be women.

699
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:43,910
When the women become very arrogant and become
very aggressive, then men also to overpower

700
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:48,339
them become even more, and a sort of a competition
starts, and then they become, first become

701
00:50:48,339 --> 00:50:53,760
like donkeys, then become like horses, then
they will become like mares, then become like

702
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,259
lions, then tigers and you get lost among
them, you don’t know what’s the matter.

703
00:50:57,259 --> 00:51:01,259
You see any film, anything you find nothing
but fighting going on between husband and

704
00:51:01,259 --> 00:51:04,999
wife, as if they are married just to fight,
they had no place to fight, so they are married.

705
00:51:04,999 --> 00:51:09,160
All the time this kind of a struggle, and
this kind of a competition that goes about,

706
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:12,860
gives you a very bad Vishuddhi.

707
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:16,859
And that if men are smoking, “What’s wrong
if we smoke?”

708
00:51:16,859 --> 00:51:17,859
“What’s wrong?”

709
00:51:17,859 --> 00:51:19,269
This is a very common thing.

710
00:51:19,269 --> 00:51:22,740
And now, another madness is the liberation
of women has started.

711
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:25,999
God knows what is going to happen to these
women, what sort of left Vishuddhi they’ll

712
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:26,999
be having.

713
00:51:26,999 --> 00:51:32,860
They’ll be having a head just like this,
they might have a cancer in this part, maybe,

714
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:36,410
and they might have a trouble because they
are doing something so unnatural, which is

715
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:38,099
not suitable to them.

716
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:43,910
Is possible also in our Indian life, we can
get cancer of our left Vishuddhi.

717
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:50,789
How do you get cancer of the left Vishuddhi
in Indian life is by taking the mantras, by

718
00:51:50,789 --> 00:51:53,509
taking the name of God for hours together.

719
00:51:53,509 --> 00:51:58,359
For example, if you start singing the song
is all right.

720
00:51:58,359 --> 00:52:02,109
But if you go on saying Ram, Ram, Ram, Ram,
Ram, Ram, morning till evening, you might

721
00:52:02,109 --> 00:52:03,359
develop a cancer.

722
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:09,529
I had a patient who came to see Me who had
a cancer of the left side.

723
00:52:09,529 --> 00:52:10,529
I asked him, “What do you do?

724
00:52:10,529 --> 00:52:11,779
How did you get this?”.

725
00:52:11,779 --> 00:52:15,119
He told me that he is working for a firm,
which supplies people to chant God’s name.

726
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:16,119
I said, “What?”

727
00:52:16,119 --> 00:52:23,710
He said, “Yes, there is a firm which has
people trained how to chant God’s name and

728
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:25,339
they are supplied to all the Marwadis.

729
00:52:25,339 --> 00:52:31,160
Whenever they have a program, they put up
these people there who go on chanting these

730
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,400
names for hours together."

731
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,400
[Hindi]

732
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:40,109
They go on chanting this name all the time
and this chanting has created a problem for

733
00:52:40,109 --> 00:52:43,920
that man, because he had a job just “Ram,
Ram, Ram, Ram”, I don’t know, whatever

734
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,799
it is, and they sit down there and they go
on chanting these, the money is paid for them.

735
00:52:48,799 --> 00:52:51,819
And also, you see, in this country we have
all funny types of institutions.

736
00:52:51,819 --> 00:52:56,299
It’s nice to laugh at the Western people,
but if we see ourselves, you’ll be amazed

737
00:52:56,299 --> 00:53:00,769
that we have people here in this country who
go for crying also.

738
00:53:00,769 --> 00:53:07,030
If somebody’s dead and there are few people
to cry, they have people on hire, to cry [laughter].

739
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:14,059
And they cry so loudly, I mean, they have
given a special – I did not know but then

740
00:53:14,059 --> 00:53:18,079
we had a friend who was our neighbour and
he said the best crying people are in this

741
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:19,880
particular agency [laughter].

742
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,720
And if you call them, they’ll be very good.

743
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:26,380
Then also we have people who are all the time
shouting slogans, you see, this country is

744
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:30,480
known for slogans, you won’t find better
sloganish people than Indians are.

745
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:35,299
And the slogans they have is such a, such
a business, they make business out of, that’s

746
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:37,730
typically Indian is to make business out of
everything.

747
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:41,519
So the slogan now, all right, “We’ll supply
slogan people.

748
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:44,150
You want these slogans, all right, we’ll
give you."

749
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:49,079
Now in Delhi, perhaps, you do not know, I
know this because I was with Lal Bahadur Shastri,

750
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:54,369
with My husband and [She laughs] I’ve seen
this, that one day people came to shout for

751
00:53:54,369 --> 00:53:58,400
something with the slogans, you see, near
his place there was a roundabout, and where

752
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,569
people came and started shouting slogans.

753
00:54:00,569 --> 00:54:05,940
And when they started shouting slogans, they
were supposed to represent a particular party.

754
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:09,730
And they had other banners in their hands,
they had other caps and they were shouting

755
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:13,119
something else, while they were supposed to
represent something.

756
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:18,910
So, people asked them, “Are you shouting
for them?

757
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:24,640
We have paid you for this [laughter, She laughs],
why are you shouting for our opposite party?”.

758
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:28,059
So they said that, “No, no, we were – must
be a mistake, you see, they just informed

759
00:54:28,059 --> 00:54:33,740
us this, and we have sets of caps and sets
of slogans and sets of banners.

760
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:37,839
So, they gave us this, we came here, what
to do now?

761
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:39,799
Whatever they have given us, you go and change
it and we’ll start shouting for another

762
00:54:39,799 --> 00:54:40,799
one."

763
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:41,799
[Laughter]

764
00:54:41,799 --> 00:54:46,920
So all this kind of shouting, too much talking
or keeping quiet unnecessarily – that is

765
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,390
very common in India to talk.

766
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:52,710
We talk a bit too much and when we talk too
much also we can catch on the right Vishuddhi

767
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:53,809
very badly.

768
00:54:53,809 --> 00:54:58,069
While in England they won’t talk much, they
just don’t talk, you see, they just stare

769
00:54:58,069 --> 00:55:02,519
at you with your eyes, you see [laughter],
and you can be quite frightened the way they

770
00:55:02,519 --> 00:55:03,519
look at you.

771
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:07,609
They don’t believe in talking much, but
they believe in drinking much more [laughter].

772
00:55:07,609 --> 00:55:14,900
And I have seen that the people do not realize
what a strain it is for your throat to talk.

773
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:20,049
Actually I’ve seen it Myself, I have to
talk such a lot every day, I mean if there

774
00:55:20,049 --> 00:55:24,630
is one center which really gives Me trouble
is My throat, because I have to speak, unless

775
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:26,920
and until I speak, people are not very happy.

776
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:30,970
For example, today was one day, I never wanted
to speak, you know what’s the matter with

777
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:34,210
Me that I’m so full of vibrations I didn’t
want to speak.

778
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:36,890
But without speech, Indians won’t be happy,
I thought, “I’d better speak."

779
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:38,230
And same with the other people.

780
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:42,720
They would love to hear Me talk, talk, talk.

781
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:47,749
And when we do that, we catch on our Vishuddhi,
we have problems on our Vishuddhi and it’s

782
00:55:47,749 --> 00:55:54,739
rather difficult, difficult to cure a throat
where this strain is there of talking.

783
00:55:54,739 --> 00:56:01,369
All our leaders have to do the same and we
have so many leaders that I think we can patent

784
00:56:01,369 --> 00:56:05,359
some sort of a medicine for their over–talking
[laughter].

785
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:12,190
Now, after that we have a very, very important
center here, of which you all know, is Agnya

786
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:13,190
Chakra.

787
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:17,680
And this center is very important because
this center is placed between the pituitary

788
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:21,059
and the pineal body, is a very subtle center.

789
00:56:21,059 --> 00:56:27,089
And this center controls both your ego and
superego, so that it controls your thought.

790
00:56:27,089 --> 00:56:31,390
A person whose this center is out of gear,
loses power over his thoughts.

791
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:39,520
A person who is possessed, will be all the
time talking, he cannot stop.

792
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:44,390
I have seen in Paris, when you get into a
bus, you see, some old people will come up

793
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:47,670
and they’ll be talking all the time, they
are all the time talking.

794
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,140
I asked, “What are they talking?”

795
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:54,390
So My disciple told Me there, Marie, she said:
“Mother, they are talking about the last

796
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:55,390
war."

797
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:56,390
I said, “What?”.

798
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:57,390
“Yes”.

799
00:56:57,390 --> 00:56:58,390
And I said: ”People don’t say anything?”

800
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:02,240
At least in Indian buses I have not seen,
every bus stop there are three or four people

801
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,910
coming and talking loudly and they are regarded
as mad people, they get down, again they start

802
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:06,910
talking.

803
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:14,631
This kind of a disease can come in a person
who is hit by a possession on the right or

804
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:18,180
on the left hand side, but is more with the
Agnya.

805
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:26,019
If you are hit at the back, it’s a possession
from outside, but if you are hit in the front,

806
00:57:26,019 --> 00:57:28,880
it is a possession from inside, is auto-hypnosis.

807
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:33,849
For a man who is egoistical, you might get
a very bad Agnya here.

808
00:57:33,849 --> 00:57:38,829
And such a bad Agnya, just like a balloon
it grows, and you feel you should be away

809
00:57:38,829 --> 00:57:40,580
from that person as soon as possible.

810
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:44,830
There are people who develop their ego with
all kinds of misidentifications.

811
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:50,540
For example, if somebody gets a promotion,
or if he gets little more money than others,

812
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:56,700
or has a little better life than the others,
he develops this special type of a ego.

813
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:03,269
Ego-oriented people are normally grow taller
and superego people become dwarfs.

814
00:58:03,269 --> 00:58:07,819
But ego-oriented people also have a special
type of a nose, you see, very straight nose

815
00:58:07,819 --> 00:58:09,849
if they are born with the ego.

816
00:58:09,849 --> 00:58:14,739
Now for such people it is important to see
their ego and watch it and laugh at it, make

817
00:58:14,739 --> 00:58:18,109
a fun out of it and then only they can get
rid of it.

818
00:58:18,109 --> 00:58:22,730
After realization, ego starts troubling you,
you can feel the pain of ego here.

819
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:25,950
Then you come to Me, “Mother, I’m catching
on my right Agnya.

820
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:28,260
Please take it away, please take it away."

821
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:31,680
Ego is more a cultural problem also.

822
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:38,499
In a culture where it is competition and is
very struggling, and all the suggestions come

823
00:58:38,499 --> 00:58:43,579
to you that you have to stand first, you have
to be a unique personality, you start developing

824
00:58:43,579 --> 00:58:49,650
your ego, because your action line moves very
fast; by that, by that Kriya Shakti, you create

825
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:51,329
ego within you.

826
00:58:51,329 --> 00:58:56,940
People pamper you, that by this your ego will
be all right, but you do not know, they say,

827
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:58,369
“Oh you’ll look very nice."

828
00:58:58,369 --> 00:58:59,369
It’s pampering.

829
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:03,249
It’s the pampering of your ego from your
childhood, the whole society works it out,

830
00:59:03,249 --> 00:59:07,390
by which you think, “Oh, I must be unique
person, I should be something special.

831
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:09,210
I should be something great."

832
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:16,080
Any uniqueness is against God’s laws, it’s
malignancy.

833
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:20,080
If such a cell can become malignant, he may
start eating up all.

834
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,880
What happened to Hitler was nothing but he
became malignant.

835
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:27,329
He could not see through how he was destroying
others.

836
00:59:27,329 --> 00:59:31,589
The thing is, when you have ego, you destroy
others, you are not harmed and you cannot

837
00:59:31,589 --> 00:59:32,589
see it.

838
00:59:32,589 --> 00:59:37,430
The people who have superego or a mana or
which we call the possessions of the left

839
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:41,970
side, such people, do not destroy others but
they are destroyed themselves.

840
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:47,490
So the ego in front and ego at the back is
only felt after realization and can only be

841
00:59:47,490 --> 00:59:49,230
corrected after realization.

842
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:56,000
The back ego you might feel as madness, or
lunacy, or some sort of a pain in the body,

843
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,740
the whole body gets pain, it moves here, it
comes here, goes there, is definitely it’s

844
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:01,859
a possession.

845
01:00:01,859 --> 01:00:07,549
But the right ego, very people, very few people
are aware of it because it doesn’t give

846
01:00:07,549 --> 01:00:10,069
trouble to you, it troubles others.

847
01:00:10,069 --> 01:00:15,839
Now this is also a curse of, I would say,
so-called advancement and development and

848
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:19,150
sophistication, is a curse of that.

849
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:23,510
So, if you go to the right too much, you develop
your ego, you go too much to the left, you

850
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:24,510
develop your superego.

851
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:28,470
The best thing is for you to be in dharma,
to be in the center, to be moderate; to be

852
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:32,220
moderate with yourself, don’t try to show
off.

853
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:34,590
Do not think you have to be unique.

854
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:38,319
You need not, who is bothered about you?

855
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:39,980
It is you who should respect yourself.

856
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:41,369
It’s not the others.

857
01:00:41,369 --> 01:00:45,410
If supposing, you have a big car or anything,
nobody respects you, on the contrary they

858
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:50,329
must be saying, “This must be a black marketeer
who has got a big car."

859
01:00:50,329 --> 01:00:54,319
But ego can develop in a very subtle way when
people talk of their comforts.

860
01:00:54,319 --> 01:01:00,089
When we talk [of] our comforts, we always
say that we must have our comforts, we must

861
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:01,230
be comfortable.

862
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:06,299
This is a very, very subtle way, and a secret
way we develop our ego.

863
01:01:06,299 --> 01:01:11,589
Bernard Shaw was saying that “After all,
what is the difference between me and an ordinary

864
01:01:11,589 --> 01:01:13,569
coolie, an ordinary laborer?

865
01:01:13,569 --> 01:01:15,220
It’s just the same.

866
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:19,930
Why should I have more comfort and he should
have less comfort?”

867
01:01:19,930 --> 01:01:25,769
Of course, one can understand also that a
man who is doing work as a laborer does not

868
01:01:25,769 --> 01:01:30,920
have to use his brain too much so he thinks
he can put up with little exertion.

869
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:37,599
While the man who is sitting on the chair
is not used to the exertions, or you can say

870
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:39,160
the hard way of life, so he finds it difficult.

871
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:44,329
But it is such a vicious circle that when
you do this brain activity you develop your

872
01:01:44,329 --> 01:01:48,299
ego, then you want more comfort, and then
you want to do more mental activity, then

873
01:01:48,299 --> 01:01:49,755
you want more comfort and it’s a very vicious
circle.

874
01:01:49,755 --> 01:01:56,130
When you try to break through with that, I
mean, I must say the Western young people

875
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:58,400
are doing it because they have accepted hippyism.

876
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,229
Now hippyism is a reaction of that ego.

877
01:02:01,229 --> 01:02:04,450
They say, “No, we live in a very spartan
way.

878
01:02:04,450 --> 01:02:05,450
We want to have uncomfortable.

879
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:06,450
We must rough it out."

880
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:10,740
This is a very good idea, but when they are
doing it, they have taken to another thing,

881
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:12,809
horrible thing like drugs to go to superego.

882
01:02:12,809 --> 01:02:19,400
When you get your realization, you start seeing
this ego so clearly – ego, superego both

883
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:22,119
so clearly and you know how to take them out.

884
01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:27,019
You know how to balance yourself, how to reduce
the pressure of ego or superego and you know

885
01:02:27,019 --> 01:02:32,410
how to establish your attention in the limbic
area.

886
01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:34,809
Now the last of all is the limbic area.

887
01:02:34,809 --> 01:02:41,289
I must tell you that this really subtle center
is governed by Lord Jesus Christ.

888
01:02:41,289 --> 01:02:47,440
Beyond is the limbic area, is the area which
is the Kingdom of God within us.

889
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:51,130
Here when you enter, you have no thoughts,
you are without thoughts.

890
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:54,580
But still the Kundalini has to pierce, you
are to be born again.

891
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:57,559
In the limbic area, all the seven centers
are there.

892
01:02:57,559 --> 01:03:02,749
I mean, there are so many centers we have
got that all the brain cells can be called

893
01:03:02,749 --> 01:03:08,380
as centers, but specially these seven centers
can be easily located in your limbic area.

894
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:14,380
Now you have seen that when you are realized,
even if you put your fingers into your ears,

895
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:19,749
you can hear the minutest of notes and music,
because you start hearing through this.

896
01:03:19,749 --> 01:03:23,509
Limbic area is a very important thing, but
I think the medical science doesn’t know

897
01:03:23,509 --> 01:03:24,650
much about it.

898
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:31,130
After realization you know the Sahasrara,
what it is, how it works out and how the deity

899
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:35,420
at Sahasrara gives you realization, how it
works it out.

900
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:39,920
It’s a important thing that you must get
realization before I talk to you about Sahasrar.

901
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:44,470
In all the ancient books, nothing has been
written about Sahasrar.

902
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:48,609
Nobody has written anything much about [it],
except that it has this color, there are many

903
01:03:48,609 --> 01:03:52,920
petals, but not much has been described about
Sahasrar because it is left to My lot to explain

904
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,640
to you what Sahasrara is.

905
01:03:55,640 --> 01:04:00,900
These are all the centers we have tried to
cover in a very short time, whatever it is,

906
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:08,119
in a very fast way I should say, but to digest
it, you must get the book, we have got “Advent”,

907
01:04:08,119 --> 01:04:10,940
and other books, go through it, read it, understand
it.

908
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:15,240
It’s a regular knowledge; it’s the absolute
knowledge which you should have.

909
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:22,839
Now, tomorrow [hindi] – tomorrow we have
a program here, and that’s very important

910
01:04:22,839 --> 01:04:26,829
because this I told you what we have got,
what are the centers are, how the Kundalini

911
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:27,829
is.

912
01:04:27,829 --> 01:04:31,309
Tomorrow we – I will tell you what is to
be done after realization.

913
01:04:31,309 --> 01:04:36,140
It’s very important, you must all come here
and get your realization established, we are

914
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:40,060
going to work more on realization than on
all this knowledge.

915
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:45,739
You see, you become all –being all intellectuals,
you always want to know the engineering of

916
01:04:45,739 --> 01:04:46,739
it.

917
01:04:46,739 --> 01:04:49,029
But the engineering is not so important as
the happening.

918
01:04:49,029 --> 01:04:52,999
You see, I may tell you the whole engineering
about electricity and all that, but if there

919
01:04:52,999 --> 01:04:55,200
is no light here, it has no meaning.

920
01:04:55,200 --> 01:05:03,420
So one has to realize that the engineering
is a headache without the light.

921
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:04,920
It’s better to know that you are the Spirit.
