00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:36.830
So, this day is extremely important in a way
for Sahaja Yogis to observe and I'm happy

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:47.169
that I am here because it's very important
also for America. As I told you that, I have

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:58.840
already talked to you how the war between
Alexander and Poros was finished because of

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:08.190
a sister's intervention. And also how Shri
Krishna whose sister was Draupadi, Vishnumaya

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:19.419
was born as Draupadi and how He came to save
Her chastity by rushing all the way from Dwarika.

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:33.860
So, you can see that when we ascend in the
collective consciousness and we have collective

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:45.240
living, collective meeting at the Vishuddhi
Chakra, Shri Krishna establish this, or He

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:56.419
manifested this pure relationship of a sister.

00:07:56.419 --> 00:08:06.870
In a collective life that we have, in the
Ashram where we live, where we move about

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:19.160
as Sahaja Yogis, if we do not have this basic
principle within us, there will be a chaos,

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:28.810
complete chaos. Once this purity of relationship
is established, that apart from my wife, all

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:54.059
the rest are my sisters or mothers, it cannot
be a proper society and the chaos of the social

00:08:54.059 --> 00:09:05.410
system of America is because they have no
sense of pure relationships.

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:10.990
Once you call somebody a sister, she's a sister.
And once you call somebody a brother, she's

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:16.829
(FYI -Mother does say She's - we double checked)
a brother. It's not only that you should be

00:09:16.829 --> 00:09:25.889
born of the same parents, it's not necessary,
but this is a very important principle to

00:09:25.889 --> 00:09:36.160
have a very pure society where everybody can
live peacefully. It's a common thing I have

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:45.949
seen in the West, that a lady comes as a friend
of the wife of the house. So, she's there

00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:55.319
and she is a sister of the husband, has to
be. But on the contrary, next day you find

00:09:55.319 --> 00:10:12.179
that this man starts having bad eyes towards
this lady, because, from very childhood, if

00:10:12.179 --> 00:10:20.860
you have not fixed your attention on your
sister, with all that purity, you cannot have

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:29.569
that pure feelings for another woman.

00:10:29.569 --> 00:10:38.899
The starting point is your own sister. The
son is born and then the daughter is born

00:10:38.899 --> 00:10:46.269
or first the daughter is born and the son
is born. From that small age, when they are

00:10:46.269 --> 00:10:55.869
innocent, this is a dimension of sisterly
pure relationship is developed, even when

00:10:55.869 --> 00:11:04.189
the society is so corrupt and bad. But at
a very young age, say, at the age of eighteen

00:11:04.189 --> 00:11:16.329
years, because of the social relations here
and the social ideas, the second part, which

00:11:16.329 --> 00:11:26.230
is a brother's duty towards the sister, is
to respect the chastity of his sister and

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:42.779
to protect it, and also it is the sister's
duty to keep the brother moral, morally all

00:11:42.779 --> 00:11:44.019
right.

00:11:44.019 --> 00:11:52.379
So once it becomes freedom after the eighteen
years of time, eighteen years of age, then

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:58.699
the sister goes with any man, lives with any
man, the boy is not supposed to say anything,

00:11:58.699 --> 00:12:05.999
or if the brother goes and stays with anyone,
the sister cannot say anything, she cannot

00:12:05.999 --> 00:12:16.929
interfere. On the contrary, like India anywhere
or I was told also in China and Egypt, even

00:12:16.929 --> 00:12:25.929
Islamic countries, if they find their sister
going with another man, they'll shoot that

00:12:25.929 --> 00:12:32.689
man, in the Islamic countries. In India they
may not shoot, but they will see that the

00:12:32.689 --> 00:12:42.199
sister is put right. Same with the brother,
in India I can say, in China also. If the

00:12:42.199 --> 00:12:49.929
brother is immoral, he's going the wrong way,
then the sister tries her level best to bring

00:12:49.929 --> 00:12:55.079
him back to normal morality.

00:12:55.079 --> 00:13:01.860
It's very common that if a man is doing wrong,
then the wife goes to the sister and she's

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:13.019
very anxious, and she becomes very upset about
it. She goes all out to correct her brother.

00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:24.660
And this innate understanding exists within
us. In every person, whether you are born

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:32.360
in America or anywhere, that if the brother
is doing the wrong thing, if he is smoking,

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:39.089
if he is doing wrong things, more than the
mother, the sister feels it, more than the

00:13:39.089 --> 00:13:48.489
mother, the sister wants that it should be
corrected, and she goes all out, to fight

00:13:48.489 --> 00:13:55.749
it out. Mother may start crying, weeping,
give up, but the sister will go on fighting

00:13:55.749 --> 00:14:05.699
her brother. In her, all efforts, she will
see to it that the brother comes around. Also,

00:14:05.699 --> 00:14:14.009
other things like, if the brother is doing
something illegal, something wrong, something

00:14:14.009 --> 00:14:22.709
which is detrimental to the society, it is
the sister, who has a right, divine right,

00:14:22.709 --> 00:14:26.170
to go and correct.

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:32.549
In a society, where this relationship is very
pure and where societies are quite settled

00:14:32.549 --> 00:14:38.649
down, the question doesn't arise, mostly,
that the sisters do wrong. But supposing a

00:14:38.649 --> 00:14:46.230
sister does something wrong, supposing a sister
goes out of the family, she tries to give

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:57.139
up her family for somebody else, or she tries
to dominate her husband or to do something

00:14:57.139 --> 00:15:09.720
wrong in the family, then the brother will
go and tell her off, what he thinks of her,

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:15.720
and will try to correct her.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:22.939
So this right to correct between brother and
sister does exist, not because it is some

00:15:22.939 --> 00:15:32.579
sort of an outward thing but innately from
within ourselves. This is the Ganesha Principle

00:15:32.579 --> 00:15:39.749
which acts, on Vishuddhi Chakra where, whatever
communications we have, we have a sister's

00:15:39.749 --> 00:15:47.299
relationship and a mother's relationship.
Krishna also had a Foster Mother, as you know,

00:15:47.299 --> 00:15:56.379
and the relationship with Him was exactly
like Her Own Son. So, if you call somebody

00:15:56.379 --> 00:16:05.919
as a mother, it has to be absolutely pure
relationships. So there are three types of

00:16:05.919 --> 00:16:15.019
relationships with a woman, is one, is that
of a mother, another of a sister or a daughter,

00:16:15.019 --> 00:16:19.609
and another is of a wife.

00:16:19.609 --> 00:16:25.759
Daughter cannot correct the father. Daughter
has no right to correct the father and she

00:16:25.759 --> 00:16:29.579
will not correct the father. On the contrary,
even if he does wrong, she'll support him.

00:16:29.579 --> 00:16:36.759
She'll stand by him. Always. She will even
go against the mother to support father. It's

00:16:36.759 --> 00:16:43.619
nature. It's natural. But the son will correct
the father, if he is doing something against

00:16:43.619 --> 00:16:54.819
the mother. It's a natural thing. It's a male
force supporting the female's force or the

00:16:54.819 --> 00:17:03.089
female force correcting the male force in
such a manner that the society is kept clean

00:17:03.089 --> 00:17:05.400
and there is proper growth.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:13.170
Only among barbaric people, according to Shastras,
only the Rakshas indulge into such impure

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:24.440
relationships all the time. Because there
is no purity in the society, it crawls up

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:35.200
into our mind and mentally we accept these
things as norms. Otherwise, there is no need

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:43.050
to look at every woman with lust and greed,
at every man with some lust. This abandonment

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:50.870
has basically started, when like Freud has
said it also, when the relationship with the

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:56.660
mother, relationship with the father, the
relationship with the brother and sisters

00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:03.630
are basically spoiled in childhood, due to
the atmosphere, due to so many things, whatever

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:12.960
it is. And once it is ruined, this principle
of Ganesha is ruined on your Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:20.480
It' very, very difficult in Sahaja Yoga to
keep such people going on.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:31.230
Now we have had problems in Ashrams of this
kind, which you know of, that they are living

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:40.100
in the Ashram and misbehaving. There are married
women also, we had experience of this, I mean

00:18:40.100 --> 00:19:05.310
it was such a horrifying thing, having 
relations in the most impure manner. Even
the unmarried, can do like this. I had a very

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:12.500
bad experience in Austria once, once here
also. It is such a horrible experience for

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:18.260
Me, I don't know what to do with them, because
I know they are Sahaja Yogis, they are seekers,

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:24.290
but this kind of weakness, we cannot have
in collectivity. It is like one really, a

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:35.000
bad apple, which will ruin all of them. So
even a one example like that cannot be tolerated,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.580
not that, because it is so very venomnous,
(FYI _The correct word is Venomous but Mother

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:54.400
uses Venomnous) but because this kind of relationship
will ruin our collectivity.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:20:04.710
In India we had a system called "Gotra", which
meant, that whatever university we studied,

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:11.160
is that your Gotra. For example, My forefathers',
forefathers', forefathers, all of them studied

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:22.290
in one university, which was started by Shandily
Muni. So they all went to his Ashram in different

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:32.320
places and did this, what you can say, a studies
and all those things together, but in one

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:41.120
Gotra, you cannot marry. Now so many years
have passed. Because we belong to Shandilya

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:52.950
Gotra, we cannot marry anyone in that Gotra.
So to that extent it is, and when to that

00:20:52.950 --> 00:21:03.160
extent it comes in our mind, we don't think
the other way round and doesn't come into

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.540
our minds like that.

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:12.290
Now we have societies like Islam, this Muslim
societies also. In the Muslim society because

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:21.500
of Pardha system, they are always suspicious
and they can never trust that a woman is having

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:28.270
a good relation with brothers or not, because
they have no Gotra system at all. They are

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:33.850
so suspicious, because there's no freedom
to talk and I have seen in India, where also

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:40.430
we can see that is quite a pure relationship
idea between the Muslims, but Muslims have

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:47.080
this problem. The women are suspicious, men
are suspicious, and everything is done secretly

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.270
and in a funny manner.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:56.840
So another thing should be, that we should
be absolutely free in an Ashram. But there

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:03.840
should not be a particular interest in one
person. If somebody gets a particular interest

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:11.350
in one person, then it is wrong. But in general,
we should be free as brothers and sisters.

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:18.000
I mean, we should be very free. The suspicion
should not come in, at that time. Suspicion

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:26.650
can only come in when one person is interested
only in one person and that is the time we

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:33.700
have to correct. Very important. Because,
it's all right, supposing somebody is a leader,

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:41.830
you are looking after the leader, is all right.
If somebody is your Rakhi Brother, is all

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:47.760
right, you are looking after Rakhi Brother.
But if you go beyond a certain limit, then

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:54.150
you better correct yourself, it's wrong. And
then if you really want to deceive yourself

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:58.250
and say, ' No, no, no, nothing's wrong,' then
know that this is not the way. You have come

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:03.880
to Sahaja Yoga, giving up all these nonsensical
things to ascend, and now this again crawling

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.180
upon you.

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:10.960
So the relationships should be of the same
type with everyone. Now what is the difference

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:17.310
in a society which is supposed to be elite,
where people flirt with each other. They'll

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:22.440
freely freely flirt, they flirt with this
person, that person that person that person,

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:31.690
like that. Not interested in anybody, this
thing. But, when they talk and when they have

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:40.950
any communication, what is behind this? Because
we have to search our own souls. We have to

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:49.150
find out ourselves. That's very important.
Soul-searching is important to see, why am

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:58.400
I so friendly with such and such person? If
you think that you are friendly with such

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:03.800
and such person for some other purpose, like
somebody might say that, ' Oh, I am all right,

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:10.970
because I am working with her,' or something
like that, but why interested?

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:17.070
Because soul-searching is very important in
these countries specially, because here there

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:26.510
is no norms about how you behave with other
women. So we have to be absolutely free as

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:30.630
I said with each other in the sense like that
brothers and sisters are. And whatever are

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:36.580
the limitations of a woman must be observed,
like you see, say, if My brother is sitting

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:46.330
with Me, I cannot watch a romantic picture.
Cannot. If My daughters are there, My husband

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:55.030
will not sit there to watch a romantic picture.
It's very subtle. With the brother you won't

00:24:55.030 --> 00:25:01.930
discuss something, normally, say about sex
or about things like that, because it is such

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:08.790
a private thing that you can only have this
with your husband. So, if he is a brother

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:16.740
and you find him that he is trying to attract
the person in a way that you should not, then

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:23.620
you have to place yourself, against yourself,
and see for your sake, why you are doing it?

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:32.940
It's such a frivolous, nonsense thing, it's
a joyless pursuit! So why should I do it?

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:38.630
Once you understand the importance that Sahaja
Yoga, you can only achieve your ascent through

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:44.710
purity. There's no other way round. Anything
which is hanging on to you, will keep you

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:53.580
down. And whatever you go, start dropping
it out, whether it is ego, superego, anything.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:26:03.630
But the highest of all is the purity of your
mind as far as the sex is concerned. I will

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:14.680
give it the highest part. That's what we call
as innocence. That's the only thing that will

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:23.270
take you ahead. And so we all should try to
search our souls.

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:29.480
Now there are men and women who doubt each
other, all the time, and go on doubting each

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:37.280
other. But it is another joyless pursuit.
We have to watch ourselves and not others.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:44.950
By doubting others we ruin our lives and the
lives of others. But, is the duty of the wife

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:53.460
and the husband to correct each other, if
they find anything wrong in that relationship.

00:26:53.460 --> 00:27:00.070
Now this discrimination has to be there. Mostly
I have seen that if they are crazy people,

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:11.220
they'll go on doubting everyone. It's a kind
of a possession. If they are doubting their

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:18.630
wife they'll go on after her life. If they
are doubting about the husband, they'll go

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:27.380
on after. This again spoils your collectivity.
Such people cannot be collective and cannot

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:34.970
be Sahaj. And I would say such people should
be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga. Or else they

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:44.460
should be separated. Because, this is a very
subtle type of an aggression can take place

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:54.170
or a subtle type of a torture can take place
and a very bad type of relationships can develop,

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:57.520
between the Sahaja Yogis.

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:05.820
I have seen one case in Australia, which was
very, very serious for Me. There was an Indian

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:13.330
girl and she got after her husband about these
things and so many people she hurt and so

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:19.530
many people left Sahaja Yoga and nobody could
discover why they are leaving. Because, she

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:29.790
used to do, very subtly. And it came out of
her inferiority complex, or whatever it is

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:35.980
and when she came to India, her husband left
her and when I talked to her, the person whom

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:44.740
she was suspecting is one of the gem of a
persons I know. I was shocked, how she could

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:50.450
think like that. Now I discovered that her
mother was like that also.

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:59.430
So one has to know that the purity of mind
has to be there, has to be very clean and

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:12.550
open. But in that openness, you should see
the freshness of mind. If you are not fresh,

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:18.190
in your mind, and you do then think, then
know, that is not correct. Today I am touching

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:23.470
these subjects because we have had problems
like this in America. And also America is

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:27.740
a place which is seething with this nonsense.
And I don't know when are they going to stop

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:36.330
it. There is no end to it. But for you people
to establish proper, proper collectivity,

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:44.900
it is extremely important to understand, that
you should do soul- searching about it. You

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:53.059
have to understand through your vibrations,
through your own understanding. Because I

00:29:53.059 --> 00:29:57.450
cannot say, "You are wrong, you are wrong."
You have to find out, if there is something

00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:06.270
wrong within you to establish this pure relationship.
If you people really strive to do that, and

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:16.830
really pray, I tell you half of the problems
of this country will be solved. Solved forever.

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:22.980
You see, people are suffering from this disease,
that disease. I mean, I ask them, " Why do

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:28.370
you do that?" He said, 'Because women are
not dependable; You go home, there is a play

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:34.940
with another man. It's better to stay with
a man than to stay with a woman.' I mean,

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:40.290
absurd, unnatural, nonsensical thing they
do. Same with the women.

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:51.580
Now if fidelity is between husband and wife
in the real sense of the word, again we come

00:30:51.580 --> 00:31:02.010
to reality, real sense of the word, then the
man and women should become free like birds.

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:15.990
They know. So, it is the childhood relationship
between brother and a sister. I would say,

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:20.000
with everybody else in the childhood whatever
relations you have. You see the child goes

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.420
to an uncle, to another uncle, to her, everybody
is an uncle, to another aunt, it is that.

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:33.809
So he develops all his dimensions of purity,
in childhood. But if you keep the child all

00:31:33.809 --> 00:31:37.390
the time, ' No, no, this is my child, can't
go to this person, can't go to that person,'

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:47.120
then the child develops those corners. Then,
when the child is exposed, later on, gradually,

00:31:47.120 --> 00:32:00.190
you don't have to give any ideas; he would
not do immoral things automatically. You don't

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:05.690
have to teach them about sex, you don't have
to do anything. Because, after all in India,

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:09.370
we don't tell children anything. We never
talk to them about anything. Just grow. I

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:16.270
mean, you leave them alone anywhere, no question.
I mean, I know, now say I have My two daughters,

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:21.040
now they have their husbands, they might fight
with each other sometimes, whatever it is.

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:28.700
But left to themselves, I cannot think it
is possible that any other man can attract

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:35.670
their attention, on a wrong way. They'll be
free with anyone, talk to everyone, they cannot!

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:41.960
But I have never told a word about sex or
anything. I mean I feel shy even to say this

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:49.080
word to them. How is it they have got this
innately built in within themselves, because

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:57.360
the society, the Indian society is such that
brothers', sisters' relations are beautiful.

00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:04.990
In Greece, which is a very ancient country
also, but now they are becoming modernized.

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:10.340
So we have, our Stamatis is there, is an interesting
person, as you know, Stamatis is very interesting

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:19.020
person, he's a lawyer and he is in Athens.
So he told Me a joke. He said, 'Mother, when

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:22.679
we became young,' I mean he is already young,
but according to Me, he became young much

00:33:22.679 --> 00:33:28.460
earlier, ' so when we became young, we all
boys decided, let's have some good time with

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:33.710
the girls to be modern. But immediately they
all started, 'But not my sister, ah, spare

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:39.480
my sister, spare my sister. Don't touch my
sister.' So I said, " Which, which is the

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:45.679
girl who has no brother? All girls have brother."
I said, "No, you see, this won't work out.

00:33:45.679 --> 00:33:52.679
In Greece it won't work out. I told her."
You see exactly, see, they are suggested that

00:33:52.679 --> 00:34:00.330
no brother likes his sister to be exploited
by any man.

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:06.720
And this is the principle. How you please
your brother by remaining chaste and how you

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:11.899
please your sister by remaining chaste. So
there's a mutual controlling power, which

00:34:11.899 --> 00:34:17.019
is innate, again I'll say: "It is innate,
it is not forced by society, innate." But

00:34:17.019 --> 00:34:22.869
in a society, which is so artificial, where
all the time the ideas are put into your heads,

00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:26.589
there's brainwashing going on. You just start
thinking there is something wrong, this is

00:34:26.589 --> 00:34:35.909
not proper, this is being something absurd.
But even among animals I have seen, this works

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:52.919
for quite sometime. So what about human beings?
So all these qualities, that we have within

00:34:52.919 --> 00:35:10.079
us, which are innate, are beautiful. The societies
which are spoiled, ruined, or we see these

00:35:10.079 --> 00:35:21.059
decadent societies, that's what you can call
them, are the societies which have got a very

00:35:21.059 --> 00:35:25.869
good system built in, of brainwashing.

00:35:25.869 --> 00:35:32.960
Even about say one hundred years back in this
country, the society was not like this. Even

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:38.380
fifty years back it was not like this. If
you see the films and things you will know,

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:43.499
that the innate value system was the same,
but now people are so much brainwashed, that

00:35:43.499 --> 00:35:49.509
all their innate qualities have been destroyed,
and there are all artificial qualities are

00:35:49.509 --> 00:35:57.480
there. Now Sahaja Yoga is the innate religion
within us, and one of the innate religion,

00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:14.549
or we can say one of the innate religious
quality, is that we understand the purity

00:36:14.549 --> 00:36:17.660
and the beauty of brothers' and sisters' relations.

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:32.289
Like, say for example, A is a sister of B.
Now, B has a friend. Now, this friend comes

00:36:32.289 --> 00:36:39.739
to the house and A starts getting friendly
with B, take it like that. In American way,

00:36:39.739 --> 00:36:44.559
I don't know how far they go or whatever way.
That troubles the brother. He doesn't like

00:36:44.559 --> 00:36:52.599
it. That troubles the sister also, because
she, she doesn't know how she stands, she

00:36:52.599 --> 00:37:02.910
becomes nervous. She's not sure as to how
to go far with it. So the all the relations

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:12.549
become confused and they don't know how to
how to deal with each other, how to express

00:37:12.549 --> 00:37:27.089
themselves, how to behave in a manner, that
the relationship between these three is again

00:37:27.089 --> 00:37:40.239
normal. And most of the society, societies,
which are so abandon, if you go and really

00:37:40.239 --> 00:37:47.630
examine these people you'll be surprised that
they're extremely nervous people. They say

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:53.519
that if you have to make out an American among
thousands, is very easy. His nose will be

00:37:53.519 --> 00:37:59.160
twitching, his eyes will be going like this,
his hands will be going like that, of course

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:05.880
not Sahaja Yogis, and it's very easy to make
it out. The reason is: he's all the time on

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:13.089
tentacles. He doesn't know what his sister
is doing, what his mother is doing, what his

00:38:13.089 --> 00:38:18.940
wife is doing or the other way round also
for a woman. That's why the maximum number

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:26.069
of breast cancers are in America. With all
this advancement, if you see the statistics,

00:38:26.069 --> 00:38:31.599
the maximum number of patients are here.

00:38:31.599 --> 00:38:38.559
So apart from ego and superego, the worst
thing that has happened to these modern societies

00:38:38.559 --> 00:38:47.920
is that, that they have lost their innate
understanding of purity. That innate understanding

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:56.989
in Sahaja Yoga now you have got it. So try
to develop it and flower it, so the fragrance

00:38:56.989 --> 00:39:08.239
of that innocence will make each other very
happy and such a kind of a security. One feels

00:39:08.239 --> 00:39:16.180
so secure. And that's why it is a Raksha Bandhan,
that the protection of a brother and a protection

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:22.789
of a sister. All the time you know, my brother
is there, after all, my sister is there. A

00:39:22.789 --> 00:39:34.789
kind of a very pure, beautiful feeling, that
I have somebody to protect me. And this beautiful

00:39:34.789 --> 00:39:44.769
feeling, if it's nurtured, looked after, in
a wider way in Sahaja Yoga, then you feel

00:39:44.769 --> 00:39:49.109
absolutely, absolutely secure.

00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:57.400
Like one lady went to Sicily, she is a Sahaja
Yogini and there's another one from another

00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:07.440
corner went down to Sicily. They were sitting
apart from each other in a restaurant. And

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:14.920
she just looked at her and she looked at her
and they just felt they were both Realized

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:19.450
Souls. So she just came on by, she said, ' By
the way, have you heard about Shri Mataji

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:24.539
Nirmala Devi?' She said, 'Are you a Sahaja
Yogini?" She said, ' I am.'

00:40:24.539 --> 00:40:28.729
'I'm also Sahaja Yogini.'
They hugged each other, kissed each other.

00:40:28.729 --> 00:40:34.079
See normally, if it is done with a woman,
here they will call her something else. But,

00:40:34.079 --> 00:40:44.369
they described, 'Mother, we started crying.
We both we are feeling lonely there, and we

00:40:44.369 --> 00:40:52.529
started crying.' Such beautiful relation.
But if any such I mean I was surprised that

00:40:52.529 --> 00:40:57.700
ah.. maybe some people came to India and said,
' Oh my God, here all the girls are holding

00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:04.450
each other's hands!' I said, " Why? What,
whose hands they should hold then?" First

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:08.410
I couldn't understand and they were surprised.
How are they holding each other's hand? So,

00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:15.869
I mean, at everybody is a target. Everybody
is looked into as if he is a dirty fellow.

00:41:15.869 --> 00:41:20.359
Whether it's a man or a woman, whether it
is a relationship between man and man or woman

00:41:20.359 --> 00:41:31.229
and woman. I mean it's filth. It's dirt. So
we have to get out of it. And to get out of

00:41:31.229 --> 00:41:43.609
it we must understand that, relationship are
only enjoyed if they are pure.

00:41:43.609 --> 00:41:51.710
And also, say in a sap of the tree is rising.
Now the sap has to give something to the leaves.

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:59.849
Instead of giving that to the leaves, it starts
giving that green chlorophyll, say to the

00:41:59.849 --> 00:42:08.460
flower. The flower will become green and the,
I don't know if the leaves will also survive

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:21.829
this kind of misplacements. So, whatever relationship
you have to give to anyone, has to be pure

00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:26.749
and meticulous about it, that what relationship
you have to give.

00:42:26.749 --> 00:42:33.460
For example, I am your Guru. So, the relationship
between you and Me is precise. So, supposing

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:45.239
you say, ' What does it matter, I can go and
sit in Mother's lap?' You cannot. You cannot

00:42:45.239 --> 00:42:51.380
do it. Though I mean, it's a pure relationship,
still you cannot, or, ' I might put my feet

00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:57.690
towards my Mother.' I cannot, because these
all relations must be understood in its pure

00:42:57.690 --> 00:43:06.130
forms. Even in electricity you see now, supposing
this is a fan running here, and you got a

00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:14.660
plug, now supposing you put that plug in your
nose, will it run? It looks absurd, but that

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:20.599
is what it is. All these modern ideas are
like this, that you are putting the plug into

00:43:20.599 --> 00:43:31.869
the nose. And the handkerchief, instead of
the nose, it goes into that plug. It is so

00:43:31.869 --> 00:43:40.170
absurd and it is so useless. And it shows
how idiotic people have become.

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:48.509
So, we should know what is the relationship
we have with this, with each other, what is

00:43:48.509 --> 00:44:03.440
the relationship we have in the collective,
how do we behave. Of course, in the collective

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:08.970
way, always, the girls will pull the legs
of boys and boys will pull the legs of the

00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:14.329
girls, is all right, and can go on among themselves
also, is all right. But as long as there is

00:44:14.329 --> 00:44:21.220
purity, nobody will mind. They' ll all enjoy.
But as soon as it becomes perverted, then

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:27.930
the problems start and, in Sahaja Yoga, these
useless problems has taken away so much of

00:44:27.930 --> 00:44:34.390
My energy that I am now fed up with it. Really
fed up!

00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:39.269
Somebody writes to Me from there, ' Mother,
I have suddenly fallen in love with somebody.'

00:44:39.269 --> 00:44:52.640
Now recently, there was a boy, he was married,
from England, married to a girl, a girl from

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:57.849
India. And there was a lady, who was married,
maybe I don't know quite what should I call

00:44:57.849 --> 00:45:04.119
her, she's not a lady anymore, married to
French man. She went to France, lived with

00:45:04.119 --> 00:45:12.299
him and came back. Now, he's an English boy.
They, before marriage, they were just friends

00:45:12.299 --> 00:45:19.519
and all right, and after they got married,
both of them started living together. And

00:45:19.519 --> 00:45:27.339
I can't understand. Before marriage, it never
entered into their head. After marriage, why

00:45:27.339 --> 00:45:29.680
this has entered into their head?

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:35.339
'Mother, we don't know what to do now.' You
see, that, that French boy is fed up, he said,

00:45:35.339 --> 00:45:40.079
' I have nothing to do with this but for this
Indian girl, what to do, what am I to tell

00:45:40.079 --> 00:45:44.650
her?' Because for her, he's her husband. Because
Indians are not like this, to put the plug-

00:45:44.650 --> 00:45:51.690
in- the- nose- type, you see. So she cannot
understand. And, she does not know what to

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:57.319
say and I don't know what to tell her. How
to solve his problem? It is such a funny problem

00:45:57.319 --> 00:46:06.920
now. This French boy found her out in no time,
is just given up. But now, such a headache,

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:15.680
such a ...This boy came to see Me, this English
boy, discussing with Me till 2:30 in the night

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:21.410
and then directly I said, " Now if you don't
get away now, I'll beat you," so he ran away.

00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:25.950
He came inside, directly inside. " Now, it's
2:30, will you please get out from there?"

00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:33.299
And what he was telling Me, ' I know, I know.
This is wrong. I know this is wrong. I know

00:46:33.299 --> 00:46:39.259
I am putting the plug into my nose. '
"All right then?"

00:46:39.259 --> 00:46:43.979
'But, I have been struggling with myself for
six months. I don't know what to do with myself.'

00:46:43.979 --> 00:46:50.749
I said, "But are you possessed?"
He said, ' No, but I know.'

00:46:50.749 --> 00:46:58.099
They think, in these Western societies, that
once they say, ' I know, I am doing wrong,

00:46:58.099 --> 00:47:03.190
I know, I am doing,' then finished! You have
confessed to God, you have confessed to everyone.

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:13.869
'I know this is wrong, but I am doing it.'
But till 2:30 was just saying this to Me.

00:47:13.869 --> 00:47:17.369
I said, " But what is the solution?"
'I know there is no solution, I know, and

00:47:17.369 --> 00:47:24.729
whatever I did, I understand, I know.'
"What do you understand? Now, give Me the

00:47:24.729 --> 00:47:29.279
solution."
'I don't know.'

00:47:29.279 --> 00:47:41.749
So I told him that, "Really I am so fed up
with you that I have decided I'll have no

00:47:41.749 --> 00:47:47.009
more marriages, because you have no sense
of marriage. Till you got married, you were

00:47:47.009 --> 00:47:51.589
all right. You were nice to her. You wrote
one letter to her and suddenly now, how have

00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:55.279
you fallen together?"
He said, ' It was spontaneous, got spontaneous.

00:47:55.279 --> 00:48:06.559
This girl came to place where I was working
for something and I met her. Finished. That's

00:48:06.559 --> 00:48:14.039
all.' He knew this girl before, they were
together, everything was there, nothing happened.

00:48:14.039 --> 00:48:17.019
Suddenly, what has happened?

00:48:17.019 --> 00:48:29.029
Now, what I gather that Western society is
built up against marriages, against families.

00:48:29.029 --> 00:48:38.819
To be married, according to them, is a sin.
And once you are married, to get out of the

00:48:38.819 --> 00:48:45.599
sin you must do something like that. Because
they live together, for days together, and

00:48:45.599 --> 00:48:53.630
once they marry, immediately they think of
divorce. Because marriage is now so much connected

00:48:53.630 --> 00:49:00.609
with property, money, this, that, nonsense.
That the whole thing has become so gross,

00:49:00.609 --> 00:49:05.700
and after marriage, there's no question of
love, because how much money goes, how much

00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:10.150
part of the house goes, how many things are
mine, how many? The whole thing has become

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:15.819
so materialistic, such marriages can never
be successful.

00:49:15.819 --> 00:49:26.460
But in Sahaja Yoga we marry for our ascent.
And we have to respect our marriages and to

00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:34.460
respect our chastities with our brothers and
sisters. Those people who try, to somehow

00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:46.950
or other ruin the purity of collectivity,
I assure you, will be in very great trouble,

00:49:46.950 --> 00:50:00.150
henceforth. I think every sort of divine punishment
comes after every period. And now, I've started

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:16.589
feeling with My experience that any such absurd
manifestation of impurity, I need not say

00:50:16.589 --> 00:50:24.289
anything about it. There is a divine punishment
and of a very horrible nature. Now I've got

00:50:24.289 --> 00:50:29.960
three to four] experiences and I think it
has already started. It's nice, there is today

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:37.170
is a day when I can talk to you about it.
I can't help it. I think periodically some

00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:44.029
new ideas of punishments have been started
by this divine power. And for people who behave

00:50:44.029 --> 00:50:53.160
like this, I have seen there are terrible
things. So, please do your soul- searching.

00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:59.190
Find out if there are any impure feelings,
try to throw them away. And know that you

00:50:59.190 --> 00:51:05.089
are not possessed by such funny ideas.

00:51:05.089 --> 00:51:15.729
If you start developing a deeper understanding,
then you will not be attracted by superficial

00:51:15.729 --> 00:51:33.499
things. And you won't be distracted from your
path. There was one girl in India, was very

00:51:33.499 --> 00:51:43.259
dark, say, I couldn't call her in anyway beautiful.
She's tall but she's very, very dark. There's

00:51:43.259 --> 00:51:51.989
somebody who was all right for her age, so,
I asked him, I said, "She's not suitable for

00:51:51.989 --> 00:52:00.369
you. But, you can have a look at her." He
saw her and he said, 'Mother, I want to marry

00:52:00.369 --> 00:52:05.239
her. I feel so tranquil in her company. Such
beautiful vibrations!'

00:52:05.239 --> 00:52:09.779
So once you develop your deeper side, then
you do not see all the superficial thing,

00:52:09.779 --> 00:52:16.609
but you see the vibrations of the person and
once you start seeing the vibrations, you'll

00:52:16.609 --> 00:52:27.239
be surprised that if these relationships are
not all right, your vibrations will stop.

00:52:27.239 --> 00:52:37.619
You won't feel the vibrations. You must know,
that Chaitanya is a living energy which thinks,

00:52:37.619 --> 00:52:42.710
which knows, which understands, everything!

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:48.519
So if you are getting wrong ideas about somebody
and if you try to see vibrations, you'll get

00:52:48.519 --> 00:52:55.229
heat, automatically. It's a computer which
thinks, the information that is filled into

00:52:55.229 --> 00:53:07.660
this computer, it refills itself. Such a computer.
As soon as you start feeling the vibrations

00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:16.809
of such a person, immediately you feel that
there are no vibrations or there's heat. But

00:53:16.809 --> 00:53:22.569
supposing you are unnecessarily suspicious
and unnecessarily you are trying to trouble

00:53:22.569 --> 00:53:31.140
yourself, then also, same thing will happen.

00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:38.880
You have got, of course Realization, you have
got great qualities. You are not even aware

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:44.299
as to what you've got so easily. You've got
the knowledge also so easily and didn't have

00:53:44.299 --> 00:53:52.869
to go to college or anything and you are capable
of so many things, but remember, that the

00:53:52.869 --> 00:54:01.960
power that is within you is cleverer than
you and anything you try to do, which is not

00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:11.910
correct, which is not righteous, which is
not holy, it will try to correct you. So,

00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:29.140
try to be a deeper person. Try to understand
what is behind this person, what is the spiritual

00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:42.890
quality of this person and then only you will
know that pure relationships are so fragrant

00:54:42.890 --> 00:54:44.749
and so beautiful.

00:54:44.749 --> 00:54:53.539
I really enjoy you people because you have
such pure relationships among yourselves and

00:54:53.539 --> 00:54:58.039
such understanding.

00:54:58.039 --> 00:55:16.049
May God bless you.

00:55:16.049 --> 00:55:25.309
Today, so much Puja has been done, but for
this thing there is never a Puja as such.

00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:32.539
Today we'll do the Puja, so what we have to
do is just a Ganesha Puja on My feet. That's

00:55:32.539 --> 00:55:39.029
the only thing we can do because it's the
quality of Ganesha. The quality of Ganesha,

00:55:39.029 --> 00:55:44.420
which is expressed, and the protection of
Shri Ganesha. It is He who does this. Even

00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:55.430
if your Brother may not be there, He'll look
after you. Because He's the First One born

00:55:55.430 --> 00:56:08.279
to Me and He's your Brother. He's the Eldest
Brother you have. So this is His purity, His

00:56:08.279 --> 00:56:17.170
innocence, which is giving you the protection.
So what Puja you can do today is just a Ganesha

00:56:17.170 --> 00:56:22.269
Puja, it's sufficient because He stands for
purity. I wish I could show you a photograph

00:56:22.269 --> 00:56:44.209
that I have

00:56:44.209 --> 00:56:49.239
of Shri Ganesha Himself.

00:56:49.239 --> 00:56:57.619
Actually He's behind Me, actually He's there
as He is, because you see it was a, it was

00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:09.780
a Shiv Puja, Shivratri and they had done all
kinds of Himalayas and all that behind Me

00:57:09.789 --> 00:57:15.289
and this is the only photograph, He really
appeared, so sweetly. See His eyes, when they

00:57:15.289 --> 00:57:23.099
said Niranjan. He is just so innocent and
He has pulled out His trunk also little bit,

00:57:23.099 --> 00:57:35.000
so that I should not be in anyway hurt by
any possibility. [Unclear word] I didn't see Him. But it's on (Mother corrects Herself) only in this
photograph He is there.
