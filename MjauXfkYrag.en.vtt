00:00:03.981 --> 00:00:07.381
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

00:00:10.722 --> 00:00:16.152
I want to wish you Happy Holi today. It's
a very joyous day for all of us

00:00:16.284 --> 00:00:21.964
and I have told you about Vishuddhi
chakra yesterday, where resides
Shri Krishna

00:00:22.212 --> 00:00:25.532
and why He started the festival of Holi.

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:32.728
As I told you before, this is the
knowledge of the roots

00:00:32.852 --> 00:00:40.472
while whatever knowledge we have in
the colleges, Medical College,

00:00:40.714 --> 00:00:45.404
Colleges of Psychology and Other
Sciences, which deal with

00:00:45.404 --> 00:00:53.632
human-beings on Scientific Research
and Scientific Datas, is the knowledge
of the tree.

00:00:54.295 --> 00:01:02.785
So to become the knowledge of the
roots, we have to become
subtler people.

00:01:03.246 --> 00:01:09.746
With human awareness we cannot
dive down into ourselves.

00:01:09.746 --> 00:01:14.249
For example, you are all paying
attention to Me but if I say that,

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:17.210
take your attention inside,
you cannot take it.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.794
You'll say, "How to do it? It doesn't go
inside." Our attention is spread outside
- that is how we are made.

00:01:23.794 --> 00:01:32.528
Specially, that we should put our
attention outside and understand
the value of our feedom.

00:01:33.113 --> 00:01:39.543
As human-beings we are free to
choose right and wrong.

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:47.893
We have through traditions developed
lot of correct ideas about right
and wrong

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.740
but there have been lots of saints
and seers who have given us

00:01:56.721 --> 00:02:01.501
a complete idea about what is right
and what is wrong.

00:02:02.123 --> 00:02:14.283
Despite that, we find it difficult to be
righteous, to be virtuous, to be what
that we believe in.

00:02:14.852 --> 00:02:21.382
We see something, we hear something,
we know something, that it is good
that we should be like that,

00:02:21.382 --> 00:02:31.533
but we just can't do it. We're not
'samarth', we're not capable of doing
what we believe.

00:02:31.746 --> 00:02:38.836
The reason for this is because we are
not integrated personalities.

00:02:39.596 --> 00:02:45.846
Our brain says something, our heart
says another thing and our liver
does another thing.

00:02:45.846 --> 00:02:53.381
So we are divided into three, four
personalities and that's why we
cannot integrate ourselves.

00:02:53.771 --> 00:03:00.381
To integrate ourselves, we have to
become something that is integrated
within ourselves.

00:03:00.381 --> 00:03:09.490
Now this integrated self is the Spirit.
The Spirit resides in the heart.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.360
It is said by all the seers but in Sahaja
yoga, now we can prove it that it
does reside.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.907
That is, God Almighty reflects Himself
in the heart, as Spirit.

00:03:21.907 --> 00:03:27.859
And the Spirit is the One, which is
watching us all the time.

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:33.989
The Spirit does not manifest in our
attention. If it starts manifesting

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.208
in our attention, then we start feeling
on our Central Nervous System,

00:03:40.742 --> 00:03:47.332
the coolness of the Spirit, the vibrations
of the Spirit, the manifestation
of the Spirit.

00:03:47.332 --> 00:03:53.276
But when it does not manifest, it keeps
out and watches us as a Saakshi.

00:03:53.446 --> 00:03:59.376
Now, this Spirit is the One, that is
the integrated point.

00:03:59.527 --> 00:04:03.967
Once we become the Spirit all these
beings that are within us

00:04:03.967 --> 00:04:07.849
which are disintegrated become
completely integrated

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:15.484
and that's how we become capable of
doing what we believe good or right

00:04:15.575 --> 00:04:22.350
through our mind, through our efforts
and through our love.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:32.387
It all combines together and we do
perform everything that has complete
integrated expression.

00:04:33.506 --> 00:04:40.906
Now to become the Spirit, people have
said that you have to meditate, you
have to go inside

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.296
because at the time of Shri Krishna,
He could not talk on these level

00:04:46.296 --> 00:04:49.514
that people were not so well-equipped
to understand it.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.841
Now how to meditate,
is again the problem.

00:04:53.995 --> 00:04:58.915
If I say, you have to go inside to
meditate, you'll say how to go inside?

00:04:59.156 --> 00:05:05.126
Now, we have to understand, God
Almighty has made us very beautifully.

00:05:05.738 --> 00:05:10.138
We never ask the question once, "Why
has He made us a human-being?"

00:05:10.138 --> 00:05:15.968
"Why did we go through the complete
process of evolution to become
a human-being?"

00:05:15.976 --> 00:05:20.966
Now we have become a human-being
but why, why are we human-being?

00:05:20.966 --> 00:05:25.750
And if human-beings are the epitome
of evolution,

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.834
then why there are problems, why
we are not integrated?

00:05:29.834 --> 00:05:36.587
So, we have to jump a little higher
stage, a little higher awareness

00:05:36.587 --> 00:05:40.640
by which we start understanding
the Absolute nature.

00:05:40.744 --> 00:05:45.644
Just now we are living on absolutely
relative terminology.

00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:50.832
Everything is relative. You don't know
whether this is good or bad, whether
this should be done or not?

00:05:50.832 --> 00:05:55.329
But for a self-realized person there is
no doubt because he knows

00:05:55.329 --> 00:06:02.976
that his Spirit is emitting those
vibrations, which are all the time flowing

00:06:02.976 --> 00:06:06.795
and if he tries to do something wrong,
they immediately stop.

00:06:07.115 --> 00:06:14.942
So, like a computer he gets attached or
you can say, united with the Divine

00:06:14.942 --> 00:06:22.173
and then the computer starts working
and informing that this is not right
and that is not right.

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:32.632
It's a very wonderful computer that God
has created; We are one of the most
exceptional type of computers.

00:06:32.695 --> 00:06:36.280
We have computers in the world that
human-beings have created

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.458
it has to go through the thinking
power and then come to something

00:06:40.464 --> 00:06:47.164
and the thinking is also fed into it by
another thinking one, who has thought
from a very limited energy.

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:55.679
But we do not think and we see. I see
you without thinking, I can see
you without thinking.

00:06:55.686 --> 00:07:00.916
As soon as I see you, I know who
you are but for a computer,

00:07:00.916 --> 00:07:05.812
it has to go through the process of
finding out who the person is.

00:07:05.812 --> 00:07:14.666
Now, there's a big challenge now facing
us that people are taking to artificial
methods in every field of life

00:07:14.708 --> 00:07:20.348
because they have not been able to go
higher than what they are,

00:07:20.348 --> 00:07:25.533
because they have missed their ascent,
they're taking to all kinds of artificial
things.

00:07:25.533 --> 00:07:30.336
First of all they are taking to artificial
things like computers.

00:07:30.905 --> 00:07:39.135
Now these computers could be very
dangerous because the matter is all the
time trying to overpower the Spirit.

00:07:39.135 --> 00:07:45.906
When you are creating a machine, you
don't know how much you are going in
the clutches of the machinery.

00:07:45.906 --> 00:07:51.692
That the machine one day, if you do
not allow and assert your freedom

00:07:51.692 --> 00:07:56.832
and a proportionate understanding of
the powers of machine also,

00:07:56.832 --> 00:08:00.700
you might just be finished
completely.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.970
You can see that these computers
now can speak, can take over.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:09.154
Supposing something goes wrong with
the computer, it can start devouring

00:08:09.154 --> 00:08:14.825
the whole world - how can you stop it?
Because, it's a machine, it's the matter

00:08:14.825 --> 00:08:21.175
which is, which doesn't understand - it
is innocent. It doesn't understand
whether it is constructing or destroying.

00:08:21.562 --> 00:08:28.902
So, this is a very dangerous point where
we have arrived. In every field we are
doing such dangerous things.

00:08:28.966 --> 00:08:36.486
Like in the agricultural side we can see
that we try to make a hybrid seed;

00:08:36.592 --> 00:08:43.452
Hybrid seed can never produce seeds.
Moreover the all this hybrid business
gives problems.

00:08:43.702 --> 00:08:47.912
If you study a hybrid cow and an
ordinary cow, you'll be amazed

00:08:47.912 --> 00:08:52.877
that the hybrid cow has no sensitivity
to her child.

00:08:53.411 --> 00:09:01.421
If she, if a calf dies of a simple cow, she
stops giving milk, she stops giving milk

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:07.680
because her love informs her that the
child is no more - what is the use of
giving milk now, for whom?

00:09:07.708 --> 00:09:12.628
But if a hybrid cow's calf dies,
this doesn't bother her.

00:09:13.283 --> 00:09:19.693
You see the little hen that we have
in the villages - because people have
now studied them very well -

00:09:19.715 --> 00:09:24.185
they say, a hen, which is an ordinary
hen, which is a normal hen,

00:09:24.185 --> 00:09:29.295
if it sees the little chicks around
it and when the, she sees the

00:09:29.746 --> 00:09:36.460
some sort of an attack from some birds
or something, she immediately calls her

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:43.159
little chicks and puts her, her complete
protection for them.

00:09:43.573 --> 00:09:52.233
But if you have somebody, say a,
somebody which is a hybrid one

00:09:52.469 --> 00:09:57.160
like the incubator or something - they
have no feeling for their children,

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.895
they have no feeling for them, so even if
some rat is coming - anything -

00:10:00.895 --> 00:10:04.690
she is not bothered - let somebody eat
the children, do what they like.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:12.331
It is so much going into our lives that
we are not aware as to how much we
are dominated by the matter.

00:10:12.366 --> 00:10:21.996
Matter is a very important thing but it is
to be seen what it does to the Spirit.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:27.710
Now for example, what we do of matter,
is nothing but to change it's forms.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:31.680
We develop an ego thinking, 'We have
done this, we have done that,

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:37.715
we have built this big thing and we have
huge, big palaces built by us."

00:10:37.715 --> 00:10:42.416
But what are all these things - are
nothing but stones - from dead
to the dead.

00:10:42.416 --> 00:10:46.069
What have you achieved? Nothing but
an ego, which is absolutely

00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:49.445
- ego means something you believe
into which does not exist.

00:10:49.445 --> 00:10:57.180
So you believe into something that is
the matter, that you have changed the
forms of the matter

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:00.573
but as a result what happens, you
become a slave of the matter.

00:11:00.573 --> 00:11:04.212
For example, those who are used to the
chair, cannot sit on the ground.

00:11:04.582 --> 00:11:10.722
You get used to it, you form habits and
this matter starts dominating you
all the time.

00:11:10.722 --> 00:11:15.202
When the whole ideology in the West
starts with the individual growth

00:11:15.202 --> 00:11:20.607
and also of the comfort - comfort is a
very important thing in the
Western philosophy

00:11:20.607 --> 00:11:24.160
that you must achieve comfort and
when you start seeking the comfort

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.165
of the body, what happens, that your
body becomes such a slave

00:11:28.165 --> 00:11:34.329
of the material things that you are
absolutely flabbergasted

00:11:34.329 --> 00:11:37.842
the way you land into a very
funny situation.

00:11:37.842 --> 00:11:43.876
For example in England, now I'm there, I
find it is impossible to get fresh chicken,

00:11:43.876 --> 00:11:49.534
is impossible to get fresh lamb,
everything is tinned and you
cannot change

00:11:49.534 --> 00:11:57.481
because it has gone into that kind of a
big industry, industralized process

00:11:57.481 --> 00:12:02.167
that if you want to have anything
that is simple, that is natural,

00:12:02.167 --> 00:12:09.200
you just can't get it. You have to do the
way it is done for the whole there and
that's what you have to accept.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:15.367
While in India, thank God, we are not
that mad, that we still can get lots
of things which are fresh.

00:12:15.367 --> 00:12:21.090
But the greatest thing we can get in
this world is the love, love of
other people.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:26.132
Holi is one of the festivals in which we
express our love to all the people.

00:12:26.132 --> 00:12:30.342
Now, in England if you go or in any
other Western countries,

00:12:30.342 --> 00:12:35.913
the love is expressed through a printed
card, where we say, "We wish you a
happy Christmas," - finished.

00:12:35.913 --> 00:12:39.950
To their father also they send a card,
"We wish you a happy Christmas."

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:46.160
You go to the market, get some papers,
write down or they might get
readymade everything.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.786
You get readymade for the mother,
readymade for the father,

00:12:48.786 --> 00:12:51.381
readymade for the grandfather,
readymade for everything.

00:12:51.381 --> 00:12:54.820
Just bring the readymade stuff and
write it down and send it over.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:13:02.224
I've seen sometimes people make
mistakes and they might send a, one of

00:13:02.224 --> 00:13:06.397
these readymade ones in such a funny
way, that instead of addressing

00:13:06.397 --> 00:13:09.250
to the child, they may address it
to the grandmother.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:18.499
So, it is so much of a mechanized life
that you have lost that flexibility,

00:13:18.499 --> 00:13:22.694
that can really inspire love within
our hearts.

00:13:22.694 --> 00:13:27.453
Such people become absolutely dry,
they have no love for anybody

00:13:27.453 --> 00:13:33.449
and what they want is only material
things. This matter cannot give you joy,

00:13:33.449 --> 00:13:39.796
is already said in the Economics, if you
see, the law of Economics, the first
and the foremost is,

00:13:39.796 --> 00:13:48.110
that 'A want is satiable in particular
but not in general.'

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:54.980
Means, nothing can satisfy your wants.
You will today asked say for a bicycle,

00:13:54.980 --> 00:14:00.429
tomorrow for a car, then for a house,
then for an aeroplane - I don't
know how it goes.

00:14:00.606 --> 00:14:07.666
So a person is never satisfied, who tries
to find joy in material things.

00:14:07.699 --> 00:14:14.899
So now, we come to the point where we
see that these Western countries, as
I had mentioned to you earlier

00:14:14.899 --> 00:14:18.974
the three affluent countries like
Sweden, Norway and Switzerland

00:14:18.974 --> 00:14:25.980
are competing among themselves, as to
the rate of suicidal tendencies and
how many people suicide.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:29.501
Now of course, this year they have given
prize to Switzerland because

00:14:29.501 --> 00:14:33.537
they have the greatest number of
people, young people who are
committing suicide.

00:14:33.537 --> 00:14:37.967
So they have the highest income.
Despite that they are committing
suicide

00:14:37.967 --> 00:14:41.618
because they have not found the joy.
They have done everything.

00:14:41.618 --> 00:14:46.154
They have got beautiful Railways, they
have got beautiful telephones - not
like Delhi telephones

00:14:46.162 --> 00:14:52.452
and they have got everything first class.
Despite all that they have now decided

00:14:52.452 --> 00:14:57.372
that most of the young people should
commit suicide - that's the only
way they can exist.

00:14:57.372 --> 00:15:02.644
That suggests one thing definitely,
that their movement towards the

00:15:02.644 --> 00:15:10.274
achievement of material well-being has
not given them anything of substantial
value.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:19.362
So now they are turning to God, turning
to Spirit, trying to find out what should
they do to become the Spirit.

00:15:20.139 --> 00:15:24.729
Now we must know those people have
talked of the Spirit didn't tell lies.

00:15:24.729 --> 00:15:27.660
They didn't tell us lies - that is
first thing we must know.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:32.994
There are some people who say, "We
don't believe in God," - I think is a
sign of complete arrogance,

00:15:32.994 --> 00:15:39.745
is a sign of ignorance also that you
just say, "I don't believe in God."

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:47.230
Is like a person who goes to a University
or school and there he goes and
tells his teacher,

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:49.774
"I don't believe in this that this
can happen."

00:15:50.192 --> 00:15:59.162
If you are sensible and balanced person
and wise, then you can think it over,

00:15:59.162 --> 00:16:05.643
that why is it in the world today
there's a moral crisis, why we are
suffering so much?

00:16:05.643 --> 00:16:10.257
The reason is, we have given too much
importance to the material living.

00:16:10.257 --> 00:16:15.789
Too much importance. The material life
also cannot be a enjoyed without the
Spiritual life.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:21.562
Now, I'll tell you what happens when the
Kundalini rises above the Agnya Chakra,

00:16:21.562 --> 00:16:27.644
which is placed between the pitutary
and the pineal body in the
optic chiasma.

00:16:28.652 --> 00:16:35.182
The optic chiasma has got this very
important center.

00:16:35.662 --> 00:16:41.572
Now this important center cannot be
seen through a microscope or anything

00:16:41.572 --> 00:16:47.781
but it asserts and exerts this power
when you see the Kundalini rising.

00:16:47.781 --> 00:16:54.273
When the Kundalini rises, mostly it
stops at that point, which we call
as the Agnya chakra.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:59.200
You have seen now - yesterday you saw
so many people had this problem

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:03.860
of their Kundalini stopping at the Nabhi
chakra or at the Agnya chakra.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:08.740
You can see clearly when it stops at the
Nabhi chakra, with your naked eye
you can see the pulsation

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:13.612
of the Kundalini that rises and goes and
stops at liver or some places.

00:17:13.612 --> 00:17:16.163
but at the Agnya Chakra you
cannot see.

00:17:16.163 --> 00:17:19.116
When it stops at Agnya Chakra, it
also drops down.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:24.860
Now this Agnya chakra which is placed
between the pitutary and the pineal

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:31.664
in the center of the optic chiasma, is
the one which is a very narrow gate,

00:17:31.664 --> 00:17:37.351
which is a very narrow gate through
which somebody had to pass through

00:17:37.351 --> 00:17:41.919
to prove that eternal life is to be sought.

00:17:41.952 --> 00:17:48.672
Like Krishna has said about eternal life,
'Nainam chidanti shastrani, nainam
dehti pavaka,'

00:17:48.719 --> 00:17:54.369
'Nainam chidanti shastrani, nainam
dehti pavaka, na chainam ....

00:18:00.649 --> 00:18:07.669
na shosayeti marut.' You see the thing
is, 'Na kledyantiyapo na shosayeti
marut.'

00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:16.902
The reason is, what he's trying to say is,
this cannot be killed, this cannot be
destroyed, this cannot be sucked in.'

00:18:16.902 --> 00:18:21.795
What is that? That is the Spiritual life,
that is the Eternal life that is within us.

00:18:21.795 --> 00:18:27.861
Now how do you do it? Where do you
get that eternal life which cannot be
crushed?

00:18:27.861 --> 00:18:30.448
If somebody had to show, what is that?

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:39.460
Krishna has described it so clearly in
His lifetime that, 'You have to achieve
that eternal life, which I'm telling you.'

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:43.821
So somebody had to come on this
earth, on this Agnya chakra to
work it out.

00:18:43.821 --> 00:18:49.615
In that I would say, that you should go
and read some of these treatise

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:56.849
about Mahavishnu, which is described
by Markandeya.

00:18:56.849 --> 00:19:08.427
Markandeya is the person, who has very
clearly described the origin of
Mahavishnu.

00:19:08.606 --> 00:19:14.286
Mahavishnu was created by Shri
Radhaji. Shri Radhaji is the Mahalaxmi,

00:19:14.286 --> 00:19:17.954
is the Sushumna, is the
Parasympathetic Nervous System
within ourselves.

00:19:17.954 --> 00:19:22.717
She has created with Her own
will-power, this Mahavishnu.

00:19:22.844 --> 00:19:30.384
And this one was like an egg and half of
it became active and became
Mahavishnu

00:19:30.384 --> 00:19:37.476
and with that active Mahavishnu we can
cross through the Agnya chakra.

00:19:37.732 --> 00:19:44.182
As I told you before that we had ten
gurus who came on this earth

00:19:44.182 --> 00:19:50.418
and they represented the innocence of
the three, Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha

00:19:50.418 --> 00:19:57.158
of Dattatreya and one of them was
Zoraster, another was
Mohammad Sahab

00:19:57.158 --> 00:20:06.600
and all these gurus represent those
qualities of innocence of these three
personalities, called as Dattatreya.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:13.627
And also told you how by understanding
these different gurus, we can produce

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.612
effects even on our physical health.

00:20:17.612 --> 00:20:25.526
Like, we had a doctor who came all the
way from Iran and that day I was
very tired,

00:20:25.526 --> 00:20:35.612
very tired and I told him that 'You have
to become a Sikh gentleman, if you
want to become alright.'

00:20:35.612 --> 00:20:41.214
And, 'I cannot help you much because
you do not believe that there's
anybody else but Mohammad Sahab.'

00:20:41.214 --> 00:20:47.321
And he got very angry. I said, 'I'm really
very tired and in one sentence I want to
finish it because I'm really very tired.'

00:20:47.321 --> 00:20:51.431
So he went away and he came back
next day and started arguing.

00:20:51.813 --> 00:20:53.933
He said, "How do you, what do You
mean by this?"

00:20:53.933 --> 00:20:59.478
I said, "I mean that Mohammad Sahab
and Gurunanak are the same
personalities."

00:20:59.596 --> 00:21:02.706
He said, "How do You say that?"
I said it is said that

00:21:02.706 --> 00:21:09.800
once Gurunanaka was lying down and
people said that, "Sir, your feet are
towards Mecca."

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:15.844
So He said, "Alright, I'll turn this side."
He turned on the other side and
Mecca was on the other side.

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:21.849
What does that mean? That means that
Mecca is at the feet of Mohammad
Sahab,

00:21:21.849 --> 00:21:27.940
also at the feet of of Shri Gurunanaka.
That means both of them are the
same personalities.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:32.853
And if you want to argue with Me, I
cannot tell you how but I will tell you

00:21:32.853 --> 00:21:41.942
one that, if you want to get cured of
your cancer of your stomach, then
you have to believe in Gurunanaka.'

00:21:41.942 --> 00:21:47.404
He said, "I can't believe in Gurunanaka."
I said, "I cannot cure you, I'm sorry,
I just can't help you."

00:21:47.404 --> 00:21:51.565
He went home. His wife was a wiser
woman she said, "My husband is
going to die now."

00:21:51.565 --> 00:21:54.796
She said, "Alright, why not believe in
Gurunanaka, let's see what happens."

00:21:54.796 --> 00:21:59.151
So he came down after 3-4 days, when
he had very bad time and he said,

00:21:59.151 --> 00:22:01.891
"Mother alright, now we would like
to know about Gurunanaka."

00:22:01.891 --> 00:22:06.275
So I told him about the greatness of
Gurunanaka, why He came on this earth

00:22:06.275 --> 00:22:11.854
because He found that what
Mohammad Sahab had done, is undone
by Muslims

00:22:11.854 --> 00:22:19.800
so He came down to tell the Indians
about Mohammad Sahab and about

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.988
other gurus and to bring a unity of
Hindu and Muslims.

00:22:22.988 --> 00:22:25.756
But you can see now what's happening
to that also.

00:22:25.756 --> 00:22:29.672
So the all whatever good these great
people have done, can be all

00:22:29.672 --> 00:22:39.625
neutralized by our own ideologies and
by adding to it our own biased
arguments.

00:22:39.625 --> 00:22:44.438
And this is what happened with
all the, all the great gurus.

00:22:44.438 --> 00:22:50.410
Now as I told you, that with the guru
problem you develop the stomach
trouble.

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:55.899
For example a person who's following
Dattatreya always will have a stomach
trouble, always will have

00:22:55.899 --> 00:23:00.416
and if you have to correct him, you have
to tell him how to take the name
of Dattatreya.

00:23:01.211 --> 00:23:13.310
Now in the same way we know, that
Christ came on this earth and He was
the incarnation of Shri Ganesha Himself.

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:20.950
Shri Ganesha is a 'chir balaka', is a
eternal child and that's how He took
birth on this earth as Christ.

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:24.786
So when you see a cross, people
get frightened.

00:23:24.786 --> 00:23:30.418
When they saw the cross in
Maharashtra, they said, "O Mother,
are You preaching Christianity?"

00:23:30.418 --> 00:23:35.463
I said, "Supposing the Swastika
becomes the cross, have you any
objection to that?"

00:23:35.463 --> 00:23:37.106
He said, "Then we have no objection."

00:23:37.106 --> 00:23:39.941
"If Swastika becomes a cross,
we have no objection."

00:23:39.941 --> 00:23:48.394
So Swastika, which represents Shri
Ganesha, who is the Carbon atom
within us with the four valencies,

00:23:48.394 --> 00:23:52.452
becomes the cross, when it comes
to the Sahastrara.

00:23:52.555 --> 00:23:58.895
Because in between the Sahastrara, the
top chakra and the lower part of it,

00:23:58.895 --> 00:24:05.258
that is we can say, the Vishuddhi, there
is placed this special chakra called
the Agnya chakra.

00:24:05.258 --> 00:24:09.232
And to enter into the Sahastrara,
which is the Kingdom of God,

00:24:09.232 --> 00:24:13.952
as it is described, the limbic area, one
has to pass through this narrow gate

00:24:13.952 --> 00:24:17.778
and something, which is absolutely
eternal, had to pass.

00:24:17.778 --> 00:24:24.888
Now you know that Shri Ganesh is
Onkara, is the Brahmshakti, is the shakti
which we feel after realization,

00:24:24.888 --> 00:24:29.980
which you felt yesterday around you.
Now, this is the only thing that can pass

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:35.729
through this one, a small gate, that's
why it is said, "I'm the path, I'm the gate."

00:24:35.729 --> 00:24:39.548
But He didn't say, "I'm the door." But He
didn't say, "I am the destination."

00:24:39.548 --> 00:24:45.726
He didn't say, "I am the destination," the
reason was, by saying that He would
have stopped the progress further.

00:24:45.726 --> 00:24:51.983
And that's why He didn't say, "I'm the
destination," because destination is
the limbic area.

00:24:51.983 --> 00:24:57.193
Now it is very interesting to know how
people try to treat/trick everything.

00:24:57.193 --> 00:25:00.991
For example in the life of Mohammad
Sahab, He himself has said,

00:25:00.991 --> 00:25:04.848
"When the time of resurrection will
come, your hands will speak."

00:25:04.848 --> 00:25:08.167
Very clearly He has said in the Koran.
He has written so much about the

00:25:08.167 --> 00:25:12.944
resurrection time, which is today, which
you are feeling in your hands, but
nobody talks about it.

00:25:12.944 --> 00:25:17.319
They only talk about the Kayamat,
the time when everybody is going
to be destroyed.

00:25:17.319 --> 00:25:20.873
They are just talking about that part,
that everybody is going to be destroyed

00:25:20.873 --> 00:25:25.750
and you should be frightened, you
should be awed, that you should come
to all these mullahs

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:32.270
and pray to these mullahs and become
frightened people thinking that the
Kayamat is going to fall.

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:36.607
But there is a resurrection time in
between, which is described so clearly

00:25:36.607 --> 00:25:40.429
in Koran but is not mentioned at all
throughout, if you see,

00:25:40.429 --> 00:25:43.346
people never talk about it, people don't
know there iks a resurrection time.

00:25:43.369 --> 00:25:47.269
Mohammad Sahab has very, very clearly
talked about it and said that,

00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:52.192
"At that time your hands will speak."
He has called Kundalini as Aasas.

00:25:52.258 --> 00:25:57.498
Now in the Bible also we have, "I will
appear before you like tongues
of flames."

00:25:57.498 --> 00:26:00.411
These chakras, these centres look like
tongues of flames.

00:26:00.411 --> 00:26:04.716
Specially the Sahastrara is such a
beautiful assemblage of different color

00:26:04.716 --> 00:26:10.675
of flames, which are very mildly moving
and are living flames, you can see them.

00:26:10.675 --> 00:26:14.735
If you cut the brain, in the transverse
section of a brain if you see,

00:26:14.735 --> 00:26:20.407
it looks like the petals of a lotus.
It is thousand petalled brain

00:26:20.407 --> 00:26:26.232
and you can see those thousand petals
enlightened, if you can achieve your
evolution to that point

00:26:26.232 --> 00:26:35.308
which just looks like a beautiful lotus
with flame like little, little petals,

00:26:35.308 --> 00:26:41.928
which are living petals and you can see
this silence and the beauty of those petals.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:50.184
Through that, is in the center, is the
Agnya chakra, through which the
Kundalini has to pierce,

00:26:50.184 --> 00:26:56.884
which is a very difficult path and one
had to come on this earth to show what

00:26:57.711 --> 00:27:01.351
Krishna has said that, 'You have to
lead an eternal life.'

00:27:01.443 --> 00:27:07.130
That's why Christ incarnated, He was
MahaVishnu, He was specially made -

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:10.577
that's why on the Easter day they make
an egg. If you ask a Christian man,

00:27:10.577 --> 00:27:14.415
"Why do you make, give an egg on a
Easter day," they won't be able to
tell you.

00:27:14.415 --> 00:27:22.196
But it is in the Purana of the League that
you can find out, that He was first
made like an egg.

00:27:22.223 --> 00:27:28.763
Now human being also is an, like an egg
because when he is born, gradually

00:27:28.854 --> 00:27:33.684
his Pitutary starts working and he
collects lot of ego on top of his head.

00:27:33.684 --> 00:27:38.324
So ego and superego, both of them
meet in the fontanel bone area

00:27:38.324 --> 00:27:48.420
and you develop a calcified brain here,
I mean, really a box and you become a
person with your I-ness.

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:58.515
Like, "I'm Mr. So, Mrs. So, Like I'm a
citizen of this and I'm a Christian,
or a Hindu or I'm an Indian

00:27:58.515 --> 00:28:03.249
or Englishman.' All these, you see,
separate identities start crawling
into you

00:28:03.249 --> 00:28:09.859
and you become like a box or like an
egg. Now this egg has to grow.

00:28:09.859 --> 00:28:17.445
When it is ready enough, then only, just
like we a call a Brahmin, a dwijah -

00:28:17.445 --> 00:28:23.328
a Brahmin who is not a dwijah, is called
abrahmin. In the shastras he is called as,

00:28:23.328 --> 00:28:28.385
a-brahmin - he's not a Brahmin, he's
a-brahmin. That 'a' has to go away

00:28:28.385 --> 00:28:40.131
till he gets his realization, he's still
a-brahmin. So when this breaks,
this egg breaks into a new being,

00:28:40.131 --> 00:28:46.376
when you become a new being, you're
called a dwijah and a bird is also
called a dwijah,

00:28:46.376 --> 00:28:51.319
means, twice born. But there are many
people I met, they said, "We're
already twice born."

00:28:51.319 --> 00:28:53.791
Is all self-certification, "We're
twice born."

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:58.310
What do you mean by twice-born? You
cannot just give a certificate to yourself.

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:04.842
If you're twice-born, then what is the
speciality? What do you get as a
twice-born personality?

00:29:04.842 --> 00:29:12.524
First of all, you should become
collectively conscious - means on your
Central Nervous System.

00:29:12.524 --> 00:29:17.538
Always, whatever you have evolved,
comes on your Central Nervous system.

00:29:17.538 --> 00:29:23.729
But now after realization, on your
Central Nervous system you should feel

00:29:24.737 --> 00:29:32.167
your own centres, the subtle centres
and you should feel the centres of
others. That's the minimum

00:29:32.167 --> 00:29:35.206
that should happen to a person,
who says who's a yogi.

00:29:35.206 --> 00:29:38.785
If he cannot say that, then he's just
giving him a certificate,

00:29:38.785 --> 00:29:41.981
like that, you can certify yourself that,
"I'm the Prime Minister of India,"

00:29:41.981 --> 00:29:47.249
but who's going to listen to you? This
self-certification is a very easy thing,

00:29:47.259 --> 00:29:52.454
as far as God is concerned and the
religion is concerned because there is
no law that people think

00:29:52.454 --> 00:29:59.391
can really guide them or can put them
in the prison, so they do the
way they like.

00:29:59.391 --> 00:30:07.507
Now we have to understand that there
is a life in this lifetime only -

00:30:07.507 --> 00:30:13.929
you're going to get a life which is in a
very different dimension,

00:30:13.929 --> 00:30:20.326
where your Spirit starts shining through
your attention, through your
Central Nervous System.

00:30:20.326 --> 00:30:24.240
Yesterday many people felt the cool
breeze. Now what is this cool breeze?

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:32.223
This cool breeze is the Onkar Shakti,
is the Brahm Shakti of God, the
All-Pervading Power of God.

00:30:32.223 --> 00:30:37.829
The Power that converts or that
transforms a flower into a fruit.

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:42.909
Till you become a fruit, we do not
separate the fruit from the tree.

00:30:42.909 --> 00:30:48.286
In the same way, till you become a
realized soul, you cannot have
that detachment.

00:30:48.286 --> 00:30:55.294
Those people who work at detachment
before realization, are really trying to
do a very immature thing.

00:30:55.294 --> 00:31:03.380
It doesn't work. Whence you are
matured enough, then only you can feel
the detachment completely

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:06.870
and in that detachment you give, you
become dynamic.

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:14.903
Like the sap in the tree, it rises, rises
and give it's energy, nourishment,
to every leaf,

00:31:14.903 --> 00:31:21.331
to every branch, to every flower, to
every fruit and it returns back, it doesn't
get attached to anyone.

00:31:21.331 --> 00:31:26.317
If anybody gets attached like that, we
can see in any tree - it does not -

00:31:26.317 --> 00:31:30.909
they're sensible because trees and
'pashu's' are in the 'pasha' of God

00:31:30.909 --> 00:31:32.834
so they are sensible thing - they
never get attached.

00:31:32.834 --> 00:31:37.570
But supposing like human-beings, they
get attached to one flower or to
one fruit,

00:31:37.619 --> 00:31:41.269
the whole tree will die and that fruit
will also die.

00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:45.199
But this is what we do not realize, when
we get attached to our children,

00:31:45.199 --> 00:31:51.190
get attached to one person or attached
to this and attached to that, attached
to material thing.

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:57.807
But this detachment is actually your
true nature, which just works out,
when you become the Spirit.

00:31:57.807 --> 00:32:01.228
Now to become the Spirit, you have to
pass through this Agnya Chakra.

00:32:01.404 --> 00:32:05.804
Now in Sahaja yoga we have found out
the best mantra for this is,

00:32:05.804 --> 00:32:12.315
that "Mother, I forgive everyone." - is the
best mantra for this - 'Kshama, kshama'

00:32:12.576 --> 00:32:17.626
But Agnya chakra has got two petals -
one infront and one at the back.

00:32:17.626 --> 00:32:23.572
This is all placed in a this way. Actually
we can say that the front side is here
and the back side is there.

00:32:23.572 --> 00:32:30.943
But all this works out in such a manner
that when you have too much of ego

00:32:30.943 --> 00:32:39.533
when you have too much of ego, then
your one of the petals starts working,

00:32:39.533 --> 00:32:43.441
which we can say, that this
petal looks after the Pitutary.

00:32:43.441 --> 00:32:47.801
So when you have ego, you think, 'I will
do this, I must do this, I plan out
this one,

00:32:47.801 --> 00:32:51.577
I must achieve this, ' and ambitious
people - we can say the Rajogunis.

00:32:51.577 --> 00:32:55.219
The Rajogunis when they assert
themselves too much, they develop

00:32:55.219 --> 00:33:02.950
an ego on top of their heads, as I told
you and the another one, the ones
who deal

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:09.360
with life in such a way, who say that,
"I have to bear and I must suffer

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:16.320
and this is how it happens and who go
on taking the conditioning of all kinds
of things,

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:21.667
then you develop a super-ego and
the super-ego and ego both are

00:33:21.667 --> 00:33:30.392
on the head and that's how you
become the bird encaged in a
shell of egg.

00:33:30.536 --> 00:33:35.946
Now, when this Kundalini rises above
the Agnya, what happens,

00:33:35.946 --> 00:33:45.043
the most marvellous thing happens is
this, that this ascent immediately
pushes the, pushes the

00:33:45.043 --> 00:33:50.518
both these balloon like things into the
Vishuddhi chakra and the whole thing
is sucked in.

00:33:50.605 --> 00:33:58.055
I have worked out the Sahastrara in this
lifetime and as you know I also studied

00:33:58.055 --> 00:34:03.669
Medicine and partly this and that, just
to understand what these people
call this and that

00:34:03.742 --> 00:34:09.262
and that's how I can relate it now to the
gross things also. Thank you very much!

00:34:14.405 --> 00:34:18.625
Now if you have any questions like
yesterday, you can ask Me for a while

00:34:18.625 --> 00:34:23.764
and then we'll have the session of
realization for about 10 minutes.

00:34:24.588 --> 00:34:27.018
But ask sensible questions.

00:34:48.473 --> 00:34:51.053
(क्या कह रहे हैं? सुनाई नहीं दे रहा बहनजी।)
What are you saying? It's not audible,
sister.

00:34:51.729 --> 00:34:55.049
Sahaja Yogi: She says that the mark on
the forehead, You said, the red mark

00:34:55.049 --> 00:34:58.972
is very good, but in North India the
widows do not put it.

00:35:00.725 --> 00:35:03.935
Shri Mataji: You see this widowhood and
all that we don't believe in it.

00:35:03.979 --> 00:35:07.039
No man is a widower, why should
a woman be widow?

00:35:07.039 --> 00:35:11.412
You see it is the mistake of the women,
who accept all these non-sensical
ideas.

00:35:12.647 --> 00:35:17.277
In Sahaja yoga we don't allow any
widows to come with that [UNCLEAR]

00:35:17.344 --> 00:35:23.324
Is all non-sensical ideas given to us
about women. Women are so respected.

00:35:23.418 --> 00:35:27.589
Are to be respected because they're
shaktis. They're Shaktipeethas.

00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:34.547
But we the women, have made us
ourselves like that. What was the need
to be subdued to that?

00:35:34.727 --> 00:35:40.046
We have lost the capacity to be a
woman now. A woman is like this
Mother Earth.

00:35:40.514 --> 00:35:44.684
She can bear lots of things about
herself but not nonsense.

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:51.440
This 'Widhwa' and all those things, are
all absolutely nonsensical things

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.915
and Sahaja yogies don't believe in
all that.

00:35:54.743 --> 00:35:59.093
Between the two somebody has to die
earlier. Both can't die together.

00:35:59.275 --> 00:36:03.435
I've not known anybody, both of
husband and wife dying together on the

00:36:03.435 --> 00:36:08.552
same time, same spot. One will become
a widower or a widow.

00:36:10.262 --> 00:36:14.062
Is only suppression of women
which has come to us from

00:36:14.062 --> 00:36:17.396
various sources and we have accepted
them.

00:36:20.886 --> 00:36:26.126
North India, you don't tell Me about
North India. In North India even married
women don't put.

00:36:26.163 --> 00:36:28.533
They want to move like widows.

00:36:31.123 --> 00:36:34.553
[UNCLEAR] they don't put. I've seen,
I mean, it's not

00:36:34.553 --> 00:36:39.253
[UNCLEAR] not to an unmarried,
and a widow will not [UNCLEAR]

00:36:39.253 --> 00:36:43.576
They had no mark, nothing. They don't
understand the value of all this.

00:36:43.617 --> 00:36:49.467
They're about to become like
Westernized people or Islamic - I don't
know what sort of a conditioning.

00:36:52.701 --> 00:36:56.981
Seeker: I have some question from here.
Shri Mataji: [What is he saying?] क्या कह रहे हैं?>

00:37:01.454 --> 00:37:06.854
आइए सरदारजी, आइए। आप कुछ (अस्पष्ट)
[Come sardarji, come. You were
[UNCLEAR

00:37:09.441 --> 00:37:13.111
मुझे तो आजकल डर लगने लग गया है।
[I have started feeling scared these days.]

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.470
कहिए

00:37:22.039 --> 00:37:24.619
हाँ यहीं बता दीजिए , यहीं से बता दीजिए,
वह बता देंगे। [Yes tell over there, tell him
there, he will tell.]

00:37:24.849 --> 00:37:26.987
इन से बता दीजिए, ये लोग बता देंगे।
[Tell them, these people will tell.]

00:37:26.987 --> 00:37:31.468
Seeker: I take it that You believe
that all religions are good.

00:37:31.798 --> 00:37:33.868
Shri Mataji: All religions?
Seeker: Are good

00:37:33.868 --> 00:37:36.334
Shri Mataji: Good - they're the best.
Seeker: Right.

00:37:36.334 --> 00:37:41.612
Now, if one had a child and one were to
advise him and give a freedom of him

00:37:41.612 --> 00:37:46.892
to choose any religion to follow, which
religion would You advise should be
advocated to the child?

00:37:46.892 --> 00:37:50.334
Shri Mataji: Sahaja Yoga

00:37:55.679 --> 00:38:02.479
In Sahaja yoga you get all religions.
What, what Nanak Sahab has said,
"Sahaj samadhi lago"

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:06.870
Sahaj samadhi! You have to get your
samadhi, you have to become a Spirit,

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:10.288
the time has come for that. There's no
need to have so many religions.

00:38:10.457 --> 00:38:14.887
All religions are respected within
yourself because they all reside
within you.

00:38:14.887 --> 00:38:20.231
You do not know how important every
religion is to us. Is extremely
important.

00:38:20.231 --> 00:38:24.388
We do not know the essence of all the
religions. We're just outside, that's why.

00:38:24.388 --> 00:38:33.478
So, the child should be called a Sahaja
Yogi, who is dharmateet, who is
gunateet, who is kalateet.

00:38:33.478 --> 00:38:41.763
[An Auliya does not have any caste.
This leads to quarrels.]
औलिया की कोई जात नहीं होती। इनसे
झगडे खड़े होते हैं।

00:38:47.464 --> 00:38:52.054
Question: What is Your view about
rebirth in different animal forms?

00:38:52.413 --> 00:38:55.573
Shri Mataji: Rebirth in different?
Sahaj yogi: In different animal forms.

00:38:56.233 --> 00:39:02.403
Sahaja Yogi: How after man dies he will
be born as an animal or as a
human being.

00:39:02.487 --> 00:39:07.407
Seeker: Life after death.
Shri Mataji: Now why are you worried
about death, I'm talking about life.

00:39:08.386 --> 00:39:12.426
This is a typical Indian mind, I tell you.
[UNCLEAR]

00:39:12.476 --> 00:39:17.224
First of all they'll come and ask,
"Mother, was I anything in last life?"

00:39:18.599 --> 00:39:26.719
"Then , what was I?" I said, "Baba, why
are you worried? To Me you are My son,
you better get your realization."

00:39:26.719 --> 00:39:34.853
We have to be in the present. We have
to be in the present. Once it's finished,
then future doesn't exist.

00:39:34.853 --> 00:39:37.365
We have to be in the present.

00:39:40.377 --> 00:39:43.457
Question: Is 'prakriti' and 'purusha' one?

00:39:43.457 --> 00:39:49.441
Shri Mataji: Of course. It's like moon
and moonlight, sun and sunlight.

00:39:52.722 --> 00:39:58.992
But when the Prakriti creates, the
Purusha watches.

00:40:15.071 --> 00:40:21.291
Question: Inspite of my efforts for the
last few days, I have not had been
inception of my kundalini.

00:40:21.291 --> 00:40:26.113
Can I have Your touch to clear my
chakras?

00:40:26.113 --> 00:40:32.970
Shri Mataji: Alright. When you'll come
down you will have this. I'll work hard
for that. We'll work it out.

00:40:33.729 --> 00:40:39.759
Question: It is extremely typical to
become a lady saint. Please comment.

00:40:41.044 --> 00:40:44.964
Shri Mataji: I mean, I'm not a saint,
I'm a Mother, that's all.

00:40:44.989 --> 00:40:52.139
It's very easy for Me to become the
Mother. If your Kundalini is the Mother,
I'm also a Mother.

00:40:53.014 --> 00:40:58.854
Is the easiest thing to be a Mother. I do
not claim to be a saint or anything
like that.

00:40:58.909 --> 00:41:03.459
But lady is always a sage so she
cannot become a sanyasi.

00:41:05.848 --> 00:41:08.638
A woman's position is like that.

00:41:11.263 --> 00:41:15.643
A mother, who looks after the child,
gives all her attention to the child,

00:41:15.643 --> 00:41:22.764
is already in saintlihood actually. But
we Indians, we think that only men
can become saints;

00:41:22.764 --> 00:41:25.536
Naturally, those who are not, have to
become saints.

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:40.150
Question: Can ladies chant the
Gayatri Mantra?

00:41:40.354 --> 00:41:44.454
Shri Mataji: Haan. No one should chant
without understanding.

00:41:44.553 --> 00:41:49.793
Now, Gayatri mantra is to be chanted
by people who are depressed in life,

00:41:50.333 --> 00:41:56.393
who feel nervous in life, who are
left-sided. So ladies, some of the
ladies have to do.

00:41:57.199 --> 00:42:01.939
And those men who are like that, also
have to do. But those who are already

00:42:01.939 --> 00:42:05.714
riding a high horse, should stop
chanting Gayatri mantra.

00:42:12.229 --> 00:42:18.049
Question: My son is suffering from
asthma. What should I do? He is
ten years old.

00:42:18.049 --> 00:42:22.516
Shri Mataji: Alright. Certainly Sahaja
Yoga can cure to a child. You have to

00:42:22.516 --> 00:42:26.577
come to our center and they will
tell you what is to be done.

00:42:26.577 --> 00:42:31.416
All the individual questions should be
sorted out in the center individually.

00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:37.150
We can pay attention individually. We
have doctors here, we have other
people, they can look after you.

00:42:40.589 --> 00:42:47.519
Question: Is it the mother which we,
which has no beginning and end.
Therefore, how we call it?

00:42:50.058 --> 00:42:51.679
Shri Mataji: Is it the mother?

00:42:51.679 --> 00:42:56.714
Sahaja Yogi: Is it the mother which has
no beginning and end therefore,
how we call it?

00:42:56.714 --> 00:43:01.039
Shri Mataji: Mother, that's all. Mother
is [UNCLEAR]

00:43:05.271 --> 00:43:11.381
Question: I have been feeling
intoxicated since two days, something
different. What is this feeling?

00:43:12.653 --> 00:43:15.913
श्री माताजी: जब मस्त हुए फिर क्या बोलें ?
[Shri Mataji: What can I say when I'm
in ecstasy!]

00:43:22.845 --> 00:43:31.455
Question: A chandan has been
recreated for the forehead which
is white and not red

00:43:32.451 --> 00:43:37.011
Shri Mataji: There are two types of
chandanas - white and the red

00:43:37.011 --> 00:43:41.406
and the red is to be used for people
who are left-sided, depressive

00:43:41.406 --> 00:43:47.158
but people who are aggressive, are
people who are right-sided. They have
to use white chandanas.

00:43:48.901 --> 00:43:52.211
Question: Can You throw light for
what are we born?

00:43:52.794 --> 00:43:55.654
Shri Mataji: We are born to be innocent.

00:43:55.654 --> 00:44:00.740
We are born to be the citizens of God
[UNCLEAR]

00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:05.922
To enter into His Kingdom, to enjoy all
these blessings and glories.

00:44:05.922 --> 00:44:16.205
Like a very gracious Father, He's invited
you and He wants to grant all that is
possible for His children.

00:44:20.181 --> 00:44:25.571
Sahaja Yogi: On behalf of all the Delhi
Sahaja yogies, we cordially invite you

00:44:25.571 --> 00:44:31.426
to celebrate Shri Mataji's birthday on
the 20th. It is a great honor that

00:44:31.426 --> 00:44:37.981
Shri Mataji has agreed to stay this extra
few days so that we are able to

00:44:37.981 --> 00:44:43.104
be present for this auspicious occasion.
You're all invited and we hope

00:44:43.104 --> 00:44:49.467
that you will all come and bring others
also to celebrate and make this a
great success. Thank You!

00:44:49.467 --> 00:44:54.267
Now Shri Mataji will give realization.
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:22.426 --> 00:45:28.316
Question: Mother, You have told about
Kundalini jagran but how can it
be achieved?

00:45:28.316 --> 00:45:35.202
I want a practical of this.
Shri Mataji: Alright, we'll have it now.
Practical

00:45:37.805 --> 00:45:42.745
Now the people who are standing,
can sit down, can come forward
and sit down.

00:45:42.745 --> 00:45:48.665
Everybody should sit down. You'll be
seated, comfortably.

00:45:50.341 --> 00:45:52.861
Please be seated comfortably.

00:46:11.166 --> 00:46:16.586
पहाड़ की जैसी कुण्डलिनी उठानी पड़ती है - करें क्या ? हाँ।
[Kundalini, similar to a mountain, has to
be lifted, what to do? Yes.]

00:46:24.266 --> 00:46:30.176
It's a very simple process. As I told you
that we have Sympathetic endings

00:46:30.176 --> 00:46:38.101
on these five fingers, six and seven
centers on the left and same way, five,
six and seven centers.

00:46:38.152 --> 00:46:48.632
Now when you put your hands like this,
the chaitanya goes, passes through

00:46:48.632 --> 00:46:55.736
your Sympathetic nerve endings and
informs, as I told you, Shri Ganesha
on the Muladhara.

00:46:57.630 --> 00:47:06.830
As a result of that Kundalini ascends.
For that, is very simple,

00:47:06.856 --> 00:47:10.366
you have a cooperate with Me a little
bit and it will work out.

00:47:10.366 --> 00:47:17.255
It can work out on anyone. There's no
age problem, no problem at all.

00:47:17.255 --> 00:47:21.439
It works out very easily. Now first of
all, take out your shoes -

00:47:21.439 --> 00:47:26.608
is the help because this Mother Earth is
the one, which is represented within us

00:47:26.608 --> 00:47:34.438
in the Sacrum bone as Kundalini.
Please take out your shoes and put your
hands towards Me.

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:48.840
Now try to follow what I tell you. Is very,
very simple but try to follow. Is very
simple.

00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:58.400
That first of all, you have to thank your
Mother Earth or this yog bhumi of India

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:08.158
for giving you birth in this great country
and that request Her that She will bless
you at this time of your realization.

00:48:08.184 --> 00:48:14.964
So, with complete heart in that prayer,
you ask Her blessings three times.

00:48:19.086 --> 00:48:29.106
तीन बार अपनी मातृभूमि के प्रति श्रद्धांजलि अर्पित
करते हुए आप उनसे आशीर्वाद माँगें कि,

00:48:29.106 --> 00:48:35.475
"हे माँ इस समय जब कि हमारा मोक्ष का क्षण
है, आप हमें आशीर्वादित करिए।"

00:48:37.246 --> 00:48:42.066
ऐसे तीन बार कहें - पूर्ण ह्रदय से।

00:48:54.076 --> 00:49:01.696
अब सीधी बात और एक है, कि हमें अपने अंदर
बसा हुआ इनोसेंस(अबोधिता) जो है,

00:49:01.789 --> 00:49:09.369
जो कि श्री गणेश के रूप में है, उससे संरक्षण
माँगना होगा। इससे ये कहें कि,

00:49:09.369 --> 00:49:17.222
"हे गणेश, हे श्री गणेश, आप इस मोक्ष क्षण
में हमारा संरक्षण करिए।" तीन बार कहें।

00:49:17.696 --> 00:49:24.446
Please request Shri Ganesha as a prayer
offered to Him that, "O Shri Ganesha,

00:49:24.446 --> 00:49:31.127
at this time of our ascent, please
protect me." Say it thrice.

00:49:44.589 --> 00:49:55.029
Now put your left hand on your lap
comfortably. Left hand represents
the Ichcha shakti,

00:49:55.029 --> 00:50:02.430
the power of desire that your desire is
of your self-realization and the right
hand on your heart.

00:50:03.446 --> 00:50:09.226
The right hand represents your kriya
shakti, is the power of action.

00:50:09.226 --> 00:50:13.852
So left hand should be comfortably
placed on your lap.

00:50:14.957 --> 00:50:23.837
अपने गोद में लेफ्ट हैंड आप आराम से रख
लीजिए। इससे इच्छा शक्ति प्रदर्शित होगी।

00:50:23.962 --> 00:50:30.762
और राइट हैंड अपने ह्रदय पे रख लें।
इस ह्रदय में आत्मा का वास है।

00:50:31.096 --> 00:50:35.746
और राइट हैंड जो है वो क्रिया शक्ति
प्रदर्शित कर रहा है।

00:50:38.106 --> 00:50:47.656
ह्रदय पे रख कर के आप पूर्ण विश्वास से एक
सवाल पूछें, मन में पूछें कि, "माँ क्या मैं आत्मा हूँ?"

00:50:49.633 --> 00:50:56.003
बहुत से लोग जो पहले से आ रहे हैं, उनको
आलरेडी हाथ में ठंडक हवा आ रही है।

00:50:56.434 --> 00:51:03.284
लेकिन तो भी मैं कहूँगी कि सब लोग पैर ज़मीन
पर रखें तो अच्छा रहेगा, क्योंकि माँ की
बड़ी मदद होती है इसमें।

00:51:06.634 --> 00:51:13.344
"क्या मैं आत्मा हूँ। माँ, क्या मैं आत्मा हूँ?"

00:51:13.465 --> 00:51:18.195
Now ask the question in your heart,
"Mother, am I the Spirit?"

00:51:19.152 --> 00:51:27.382
Please ask this question thrice. This is
just to clear your mind about it.

00:51:29.655 --> 00:51:36.975
It's like a port of a computer.
When you ask the question to the
computer, the answer comes.

00:51:37.255 --> 00:51:49.075
So, ask the question. For people who
suffer from over-active heart

00:51:49.075 --> 00:51:58.334
and all the consequent diseases out of
that should always use this as a mantra
saying, "Mother, I am the Spirit."

00:52:01.078 --> 00:52:06.658
Now put this right hand on the stomach
on the left hand side.

00:52:07.374 --> 00:52:16.074
Now here the chakra of guru tatwa
works up. The guru tatwa,

00:52:16.074 --> 00:52:20.717
the principle of guru within you works
out on the left hand side of your
stomach.

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:28.470
As you are the Spirit, you have to be
your own guru. So you have to say,

00:52:28.567 --> 00:52:31.247
"Mother, am I my own guru?"

00:52:32.054 --> 00:52:36.964
अब राइट हैंड अपने पेट पर आप लेफ्ट
साइड में रख लीजिए।

00:52:39.571 --> 00:52:46.641
और इसके बाद आप ये सवाल पूछिए कि,
"माँ क्या मैं स्वयं का गुरु हूँ?"

00:52:46.641 --> 00:52:56.924
क्योंकि ये गुरु तत्व का सेंटर है, उसका केंद्र है;
और क्योंकि आपने पहला सवाल पूछा था,
कि क्या आप आत्मा हैं।

00:52:56.924 --> 00:53:05.659
आपने उसी के क्रमुक आपने जो दूसरा सवाल है
वो पूछा कि, "माँ क्या मैं स्वयं का गुरु हूँ?"
ये तीन बार पूछिए।

00:53:11.233 --> 00:53:20.013
इसके पूछने के बाद आप इस राइट हैंड को फिर
नीचे की तरफ ले जाएँ। पेट पर नीचे की
तरफ रखें।

00:53:20.479 --> 00:53:32.309
इस जगह जो स्वाधिष्ठान चक्र है, जो स्वाधिष्ठान चक्र
है, वो यहाँ पर शुद्ध विद्या प्रदान करता है,
आपको शुद्ध विद्या देता है।

00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:39.945
शुद्ध विद्या वो विद्या है जिससे आप परमात्मा का
दिया हुआ ये जो आशीर्वाद है,

00:53:39.945 --> 00:53:49.573
जो आपका आत्मसाक्षात्कार है, उसे आप प्लावित
कर सकते हैं, उसे आप इस्तेमाल कर सकते हैं।

00:53:50.004 --> 00:53:53.774
आप ये जान सकते हैं कि परमात्मा के
कायदे-कानून क्या हैं।

00:53:53.774 --> 00:53:59.898
इसी एक शुद्ध विद्या से ही आप सारा परमात्मा के
बारे में सारा ज्ञान प्राप्त कर सकते हैं।

00:53:59.898 --> 00:54:08.115
शुद्ध विद्या माने वो तकनीक, वो तंत्र जिससे आप
ये जान लें कि परमात्मा की शक्ति क्या है

00:54:08.115 --> 00:54:12.183
और उसे किस तरह से इस्तेमाल करना चाहिए।
इसीलिए इसे शुद्ध विद्या कहते हैं।

00:54:12.483 --> 00:54:19.593
क्योंकि बिल्कुल ये अब्सोल्यूट है, एकांकी
है, इससे दूसरा कोई उसका पर्याय नहीं है -
पर्याय रहित।

00:54:20.369 --> 00:54:27.439
Putting your hand on the lower side of
the abdomen, you have to say,

00:54:29.372 --> 00:54:35.632
"Mother, please give me Pure
Knowledge, Shuddh Vidya."

00:54:35.744 --> 00:54:40.414
Shuddh Vidya means the
Pure Knowledge, means the knowledge

00:54:40.414 --> 00:54:50.030
about all the laws and regulations of
God's energy, all the technique of
handling that energy

00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:56.054
and all the knowledge about the
Spirit - is the Shuddh Vidya,

00:54:56.054 --> 00:55:02.647
so please ask six times, "Mother, give
me Shuddh Vidya, give me
Pure Knowledge."

00:55:02.647 --> 00:55:07.096
आप भी कहें, "कृपया माँ मुझे शुद्ध विद्या दीजिए,"
छह बार।

00:55:07.096 --> 00:55:10.829
ये आपके माँगे बगैर मैं ज़बरदस्ती नहीं
कर सकती।

00:55:10.829 --> 00:55:14.975
I cannot force it on you because you
are independent.

00:55:14.975 --> 00:55:23.354
आप स्वतंत्र हैं। आप जब तक इसे माँगेगे
नहीं, मैं ये दे नहीं सकती, सो कहिए,
"माँ मुझे आप शुद्ध विद्या दीजिए।"

00:55:44.818 --> 00:55:50.658
छह बार कहिए क्योंकि इसके छह,
इसकी छह कलियाँ हैं।

00:55:50.658 --> 00:55:54.619
इस चक्र की छह कलियाँ हैं इसलिए इसे
छह बार कहिए।

00:56:02.062 --> 00:56:08.142
अब इसके बाद हम लोगों को अपनी कुण्डलिनी
पर प्रभाव डाल सकते हैं

00:56:08.142 --> 00:56:13.916
और अलग अलग एक एक चक्र को खोलते हुए
हम ऊपर जा सकते हैं। सब काम
लेफ्ट साइड में होगा।

00:56:13.916 --> 00:56:19.890
You have to now work on the left hand
side and now you can control the
Kundalini's ascent.

00:56:19.890 --> 00:56:27.270
So you start now to the next chakra on
the stomach on the left hand side
of the Guru tatwa.

00:56:28.024 --> 00:56:36.044
At this point, with full confidence, you
please say that, "Mother I am my
own master, I am my own guru."

00:56:49.936 --> 00:56:55.056
Say that ten times for there are ten
principles of guru.

00:56:57.976 --> 00:57:03.411
Now put the full attention onto it.

00:57:03.411 --> 00:57:09.174
दस मर्तबा आप कहिए पूर्ण विश्वास के साथ
कि, "माँ, मैं स्वयं का गुरु हूँ।"

00:57:09.174 --> 00:57:18.056
इस वक्त आप अपना हाथ गुरु तत्व के चक्र पे
रखें, जो कि लेफ्ट हैंड आपने लेफ्ट साइड में
पेट पर ऊपर की ओर रखा हुआ है।

00:57:26.557 --> 00:57:36.027
अब इस हाथ को आप ह्रदय पर ले जाएँ।
Take this hand to your heart, please.

00:57:36.237 --> 00:57:44.267
ह्रदय पर ले जा कर के, यहाँ पर आपको पूर्ण
विश्वास से अब कहना होगा कि, "माँ, मैं आत्मा हूँ।"

00:57:44.886 --> 00:57:54.506
Please put your hand on the heart and
say with full assertion and full faith in
yourself that, "Mother, I am the Spirit."

00:57:54.506 --> 00:58:01.794
Please say this twelve times because
this centre has got twelve petals.

00:58:02.486 --> 00:58:07.656
बारह मर्तबा आप कहिए कि, "माँ मैं आत्मा हूँ।"

00:58:18.319 --> 00:58:22.249
अब बारह मर्तबा पूरे मन से कहें।

00:58:26.463 --> 00:58:36.423
आप अगर आत्मा हैं तो आप निर्दोष हैं। बहुत
से लोग अपने तो बहुत दोषमय समझते हैं।

00:58:36.423 --> 00:58:42.984
हर समय दोष अपने निकालते रहते हैं अपने
को नीचे गिराते हैं और कहते हैं कि, "मैंने
ये दोष किया वो दोष किया।"

00:58:42.984 --> 00:58:46.604
इससे आपकी लेफ्ट नाभि पकड़ जाती है
जिससे एनजाइना जैसी बीमारियाँ होतीं हैं।

00:58:46.889 --> 00:58:53.419
इसलिए अब आप अपना हाथ उठा करके
लेफ्ट विशुद्धि पर रखें सामने की तरफ से

00:58:53.419 --> 00:58:57.579
यहाँ पर जहाँ पर कि आपका कन्धा
और गर्दन मिलते हैं।

00:58:57.579 --> 00:59:02.476
ज़ोर से वहाँ पकड़ें, उँगलियाँ पीछे की ओर
ले जाएँऔर ज़ोर से पकड़ कर के खींचें।

00:59:05.275 --> 00:59:11.005
इस जगह आपको ये कहना चाहिए सोलह मर्तबा
क्योंकि श्री कृष्ण का ये लेफ्ट साइड है

00:59:11.033 --> 00:59:21.323
कि, "माँ, मैं आत्मा हूँ और मैं निर्दोष हूँ।"
पूरे विश्वास के साथ कहिए। सोलह मर्तबा।

00:59:22.846 --> 00:59:28.996
पूरा विश्वास रखिए क्योंकि परमात्मा जो है
वो प्रेम का सागर है, आनंद का सागर है,

00:59:28.996 --> 00:59:38.896
दया का सागर है, पर सबसे अधिक वो क्षमा का
सागर है। वो क्षमा का सागर है - रेहमत, रहीम।

00:59:41.763 --> 00:59:53.243
हाँ! सोलह मर्तबा कहें।

00:59:53.243 --> 01:00:00.591
Please say it sixteen times that,
"Mother, I am the Spirit and I'm
not guilty."

01:00:00.591 --> 01:00:05.302
Please say it sixteen times, "Mother,
I am the Spirit and I'm not guilty."

01:00:33.090 --> 01:00:43.110
Now, raise this right hand onto your
forehead across. Now here is the
Agnya chakra.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:50.060
Press your forehead. Now say,
"Mother, I forgive everyone."

01:00:50.456 --> 01:00:56.486
While saying this you must remember,
first of all you must forgive yourself.

01:00:56.486 --> 01:01:03.352
You say, "Mother, I forgive everyone,
I forgive everyone."

01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:13.893
इस हाथ को ऊपर उठा करके अपने भाल प्रदेश
पर संभाल रखें। संभाल - पूरी तरह से पकड़ के।

01:01:14.606 --> 01:01:19.676
अपना हाथ सर पे माथे पर इस तरह से रखें
जैसे आड़ा और उसको दबा कर

01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:24.250
माथे को पकड़ें और इस जगह आप कहें
कि, "माँ, मैंने सब को क्षमा कर दी है।"

01:01:24.797 --> 01:01:29.807
बहुत से लोग कहते हैं कि, "माँ क्षमा करना बहुत
कठिन है," लेकिन अगर आप क्षमा नहीं कर रहे हैं,

01:01:29.807 --> 01:01:36.926
तो आप अपने को ही तो तकलीफ दे रहें हैं। ये
समझ लेना चाहिए, इसलिए कृपया कहिए कि,
"माँ, मैंने सब को क्षमा कर दी है।"

01:01:44.987 --> 01:01:49.907
अब ये हाथ आप पीछे की ओर ले जाएँ,
जो सर को पकड़ लीजिए पीछे से।

01:01:49.907 --> 01:01:56.637
पीछे में जो हिस्सा बाहर की ओर काफी निकला
हुआ रहता है, उसे आप पकड़ लें।

01:01:57.968 --> 01:02:04.698
Please put your hand on the backside
of your head and try to hold it
very tight.

01:02:05.770 --> 01:02:11.420
अब आप निर्दोष हैं, बिल्कुल निर्दोष हैं
लेकिन आपको ये कहना होगा कि,

01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:16.529
"मुझसे अगर कोई गलती हो गयी हो, तो परमात्मा
मुझे क्षमा करें।" ऐसे तीन बार कहें।

01:02:16.529 --> 01:02:21.907
आप हालाँकि निर्दोष हैं, उसमें कोई दोष नहीं, पर
अगर कोई गलती हो गई हो तो उसे क्षमा कर दें।

01:02:28.563 --> 01:02:32.783
पूर्ण ह्रदय से कहें। नतमस्तक होकर के नम्र
भाव से कहें।

01:02:32.783 --> 01:02:36.533
Now you have to say when you put
your hand on the back that,

01:02:36.533 --> 01:02:40.901
"Please forgive me if I have done any
mistakes," to God.

01:02:41.613 --> 01:02:45.733
To God Almighty you have to ask for
forgiveness, but you are not guilty,

01:02:45.733 --> 01:02:51.653
you're not guilty. Don't feel guilty about
it. Just say that without feeling guilty.

01:02:58.332 --> 01:03:03.642
Now, on top of the head, put your
hand, right hand on top of your head,

01:03:03.642 --> 01:03:09.389
on the fontanel bone area and press it
with palm and move it in a
clockwise manner.

01:03:09.389 --> 01:03:17.220
अब अपने तालू पर अपना हाथ रखें।
हाथ का मतलब ये है कि हथेली

01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:25.640
और उसको आप इस तरह से दबाइए और
घुमाइए जैसे कि घडी के काँटे घूमते हैं।

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:31.681
इसको घुमाते वक्त यहाँ सात चक्र हैं, जिसके
बारे में मैं बताऊँगी परसों आपसे, जो सहस्त्रार है।

01:03:31.897 --> 01:03:39.427
इस सात चक्रों के लिए आप सात बार कहिए कि,
"माँ मुझे आत्मसाक्षात्कार दीजिए।"

01:03:39.427 --> 01:03:47.372
यहाँ पर भी मैं रुक जातीं हूँ, क्योंकि मेरी ऐसी कोई
इच्छा नहीं कि आपकी स्वतंत्रता को लाँघ जाऊँ।

01:03:47.372 --> 01:03:54.923
जो आदमी स्वयं स्वतंत्र नहीं है, वो परमात्मा का तंत्र
नहीं जान सकता और वो पूरी स्वतंत्रता भी
उपभोग नहीं कर सकता।

01:03:54.923 --> 01:04:00.979
इसलिए पूर्ण स्वतंत्रता में आपको कहना चाहिए
कि, "माँ मुझे आप यहाँ पर आत्मसाक्षातकार
दीजिए।"

01:04:04.241 --> 01:04:11.261
Please ask for your Self-realization.
I cannot cross your freedom

01:04:11.261 --> 01:04:15.443
so you have to ask for it, "Mother please
give me Self-realization."

01:04:15.443 --> 01:04:20.176
Please say it seven times while moving
your hand in the clockwise manner.

01:04:22.590 --> 01:04:27.690
[Shri Mataji blows into the mic]

01:04:27.690 --> 01:04:31.893
[Shri Mataji blows into the mic]

01:04:31.893 --> 01:04:36.588
[Shri Mataji blows into the mic]

01:04:36.588 --> 01:04:41.255
[Shri Mataji blows into the mic]

01:04:41.255 --> 01:04:45.218
[Shri Mataji blows into the mic]

01:04:45.218 --> 01:04:49.727
[Shri Mataji blows into the mic]

01:04:49.727 --> 01:04:55.663
[Shri Mataji blows into the mic]

01:04:56.774 --> 01:05:01.804
Now put your hands together like this.
Don't think, don't think.

01:05:02.116 --> 01:05:07.566
Now put your left hand on top of your
head and see if you are, on top

01:05:07.566 --> 01:05:10.475
अधांत्री, सर के ऊपर, अधांत्री रखिए।

01:05:10.475 --> 01:05:18.815
and just see by pressing near the
fontanel bone area, moving, if you are
getting a cool breeze in the head.

01:05:23.331 --> 01:05:28.201
Is it flowing? Just try.

01:05:28.201 --> 01:05:34.254
ऊपर मत रखिए। जो लोग आज ही आये हैं,
उनको शायद नहीं महसूस हो लेकिन
अधिकतर लोगों को होगा।

01:05:34.569 --> 01:05:48.359
ज़रा सा ऊपर। अब दूसरा हाथ करके देखें।
हाँ! देखिये, आराम से।

01:05:48.359 --> 01:05:50.613
सूक्ष्म है, बहुत सूक्ष्म है।
It's very subtle.

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:57.426
बहुत सटल है। इसलिए आँख बंद करके चित्त यहाँ
लाएँ। इस जगह और देखें, आ रहा है क्या
ठंडा-ठंडा ? सोचिए नहीं।

01:05:57.426 --> 01:05:59.456
Hmm, it's coming.

01:06:03.406 --> 01:06:05.176
Sahaja yogi: They're thinking about it.

01:06:05.176 --> 01:06:09.442
श्री माताजी: इसके बारे में सोचिए नहीं, निर्विचार
रहें। आप निर्विचार स्थिति में जा सकते हैं अब।

01:06:09.442 --> 01:06:13.712
क्योंकि आज्ञा चक्र को लाँघ गई कुण्डलिनी।
आप निर्विचारिता में देखें।

01:06:13.712 --> 01:06:18.458
मेरी ओर देखें और निर्विचार रहें। निर्विचार रह
कर के आप यहाँ चित्त रखें।

01:06:18.458 --> 01:06:27.845
चित्त यहाँ रखें और देखिए। विचार नहीं करिए।
हम्म! ठीक है?

01:06:30.842 --> 01:06:41.182
अब दोनों हाथ ऊपर करें इस तरह से और एक
सवाल पूछिए अपने मन में कि, "क्या माँ
ये ब्रह्म शक्ति है?"

01:06:41.612 --> 01:06:46.482
मन में पूछें, "क्या ये ब्रह्मशक्ति है जो
सारा जीवंत कार्य करती है?"

01:06:46.553 --> 01:06:53.663
Please ask the question, "Mother, is this
the living power of living God, which
does all the living work?"

01:06:57.048 --> 01:07:13.168
तीन बार पूछिए निर्विचार में। हाँ! अब दोनों हाथ
सामने करके देखिए। आ रही ठंडक हाथ मैं?
आ रही है?

01:07:13.487 --> 01:07:15.617
साधक: हाँ जी आ रही है।

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:22.390
श्री माताजी: किसी-किसी के लेफ्ट हैंड में आएगी,
किसी-किसी के राइट हैंड में, क्योंकि
संतुलन नहीं होता है।

01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:26.669
इसलिए जिसको लेफ्ट हैंड में आ रही है, वो राइट
हैंड हमारी ओर करें।

01:07:26.669 --> 01:07:36.519
राइट हैंड हमारी ओर करें और पेट पे अपना हाथ
रखें। थोड़ी देर में राइट हैंड में आने लग जाएगी

01:07:36.819 --> 01:07:46.519
जिनके लेफ्ट हैंड में नहीं आती, वो लेफ्ट हैंड
हमारी ओर करें और राइट हैंड ह्रदय पे रखें।
लेफ्ट हैंड करें।

01:07:55.126 --> 01:08:00.986
अब आपको इतना बताना है कि आप अपनी
कुण्डलिनी किस तरह से जागृत खुद कर सकते हैं

01:08:00.986 --> 01:08:05.469
और उसको मेन्टेन कर सकते हैं और इसके
अलावा आपको सेण्टर पर आना होगा

01:08:05.537 --> 01:08:11.107
क्योंकि सहज योग जो है, ये सामूहिक चेतना
का कार्य है, ये विराट का कार्य है।

01:08:11.138 --> 01:08:18.008
ये इसे कि मैक्रोकोस्म का माइक्रोकस्म से सम्बन्ध
जोड़ना है। इसके लिए सामूहिक तरीके से होता है।

01:08:18.008 --> 01:08:23.016
अगर घर में आप बैठें और कहें कि, "माँ मैं
करता था और सब खो गया," सो फिर मैं
सुनने नहीं वाली।

01:08:23.016 --> 01:08:29.173
आप लोग सेण्टर में आइए, इसे प्राप्त करें और
उसमें गहरे उतरें। 'जिन खोजा तिन पाइयाँ'

01:08:29.387 --> 01:08:35.667
ऊपरी तरीके के लोगों के लिए सहज योग नहीं है।
जो गहनता से उतरना चाहते हैं, उन्हीं के लिए
सहज योग है।

01:08:37.558 --> 01:08:43.618
रामदास स्वामी ने कहा है, 'एड़िया गबाडया ते
काम नोहे।' ऐसे वैसे लोगों का ये काम नहीं है।

01:08:46.231 --> 01:08:52.721
अब आख़री बार मैं आपको बता देती हूँ कि किस
तरह से अपने कुण्डलिनी का जागरण आप
ख़ुद कर सकते हैं।

01:08:52.721 --> 01:09:00.234
पहले तो आपको अपने को बंधन देना होगा, जिसे
कि कवच कहते हैं, या कहिए माँ का आँचल,
जिससे संरक्षण हो किसी भी दुष्ट प्रवृत्ति से।

01:09:00.561 --> 01:09:08.661
तो लेफ्ट हैंड हमारी ओर करें और राइट हैंड
उठा कर के अपने सर पर से इस तरह
से बंधन लिया जाता है।

01:09:08.661 --> 01:09:18.405
एक, फिर नीचे ये पहले चक्र के लिए , फिर दूसरा
सर पर से लीजिएगा - इसका पूरा अर्थ आपको
बता देंगे

01:09:18.495 --> 01:09:41.785
फिर तीसरे चक्र पे, फिर चौथे चक्र पे, फिर पाँचवे
चक्र पे, फिर छटे चक्र पे, और फिर सातवे चक्र पे।

01:09:41.785 --> 01:09:48.257
इस तरह से आपने पहले अपने को बंधन में ले
लिया। उसके बाद कुण्डलिनी के सामने इस
तरह से लेफ्ट हैंड रखा जाता है।

01:09:49.722 --> 01:09:53.722
लेफ्ट हैंड - मैं भी इंटोक्सिकेटेड हो गयीं हूँ
आजकल।

01:09:53.722 --> 01:10:04.143
लेफ्ट हैंड रखिए। और राइट हैंड जो है उसको इस
तरह से घुमाना चाहिए कि ऊपर, सामने,
नीचे, पीछे। इस तरह से कायदे से।

01:10:04.178 --> 01:10:10.688
देखिये, अब इस तरह से कुण्डलिनी उठाई
जाती है; ये हाथ सीधा चलता है और ये
राइट हैंड उस पर ऐसा घूमता है।

01:10:10.688 --> 01:10:18.734
लेफ्ट हैंड की तरफ चित्त रहे और राइट हैंड से
उठाइये। ऊपर की ओर - उठाइये,
उठाइये, उठाइये।

01:10:18.734 --> 01:10:24.098
अब कन्धों को ढ़ीला छोड़ के, सर को ढ़ीला
छोड़ के, एक बंधन (अस्पष्ट - व्यष्टन) दीजिए।
बाँध दीजिए।

01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:44.070
अब फिर से, फिर से ऊपर, फिर से ऊपर- दो।
तीसरे मर्तबा - तीन। तीन मर्तबा बाँधें।

01:10:57.429 --> 01:11:01.409
[ ASIDE - राइट स्वाधिष्ठान बहुत है -
too much right side]

01:11:01.409 --> 01:11:07.299
देखिए अब हाथ में आ रहा है कि नहीं ठंडा।
दिल्ली में राइट स्वाधिष्ठान बहुत है।

01:11:07.344 --> 01:11:11.374
उसका कारण ये है कि बहुत आदमी सोचते हैं,
प्लानिंग करते है, जो बिल्कुल बेकार है।

01:11:11.374 --> 01:11:14.434
दिमाग अपना आगे दौड़ाते रहते हैं। अब जैसे
बैठे-बैठे लोग सोच रहे हैं

01:11:14.434 --> 01:11:19.893
कि अब कौन सी बस मिलेगी, कौन सी ट्रैन
मिलेगी, कैसे जाएँगे, क्या करें।

01:11:20.023 --> 01:11:24.963
इस वक्त आप यहाँ बैठे हैं। एक क्षण भर
के लिए आप वर्तमान में आइए।

01:11:30.339 --> 01:11:40.489
हाँ! आ रही ठंडक सी हाथ में? विचार नहीं करना।
विचार से परे, निर्विचारिता के परे।

01:11:42.055 --> 01:11:45.865
[ASIDE - It's better. Right Swadhishthan.]

01:11:49.512 --> 01:11:55.302
राइट स्वाधिस्ठान अगर बहुत चल रहा हो, तो
आपको लेफ्ट से उठाकर राइट में छोड़ना
चाहिए तीन बार।

01:11:55.302 --> 01:12:07.640
एक, दो और तीन। जितने भी बड़े-बड़े सोचने वाले
लोग हैं ऐसा करिए - एक, दो और तीन।

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:11.758
राइट स्वाधिष्ठान जिनका चलता है उनको
डायबिटीज की बीमारी हो सकती है,

01:12:11.758 --> 01:12:17.446
लिवर की बीमारी हो सकती है, किडनी की बीमारी
हो सकती है, लुकेमिया हो सकता है और उन लोगों को

01:12:23.034 --> 01:12:29.984
हाई ब्लड प्रेशर हो सकता है, किडनी ट्रबल हो
सकता है, और ये सब नहीं हुआ तो उनको
हार्ट ट्रबल हो सकता है।

01:12:31.139 --> 01:12:44.199
साइटिका हो सकता है राइट साइड का। हाँ! और
नींद नहीं आती है ऐसे लोगों को, सो नहीं
सकते रात में।

01:12:44.199 --> 01:12:52.523
हाँ, ठीक है अब हालत? कुछ पैसे भी मूड ठीक
करते हैं। सोचिए मत, सोचिए मत -
क्या सोचना है?

01:12:57.108 --> 01:13:00.498
बगैर सोचे ही सब जाना जाता है, निर्विचार में।

01:13:01.621 --> 01:13:12.081
हाँ! सब को क्षमा कर दीजिए, सब को
क्षमा कर दीजिए।

01:13:12.309 --> 01:13:16.769
सब को क्षमा करिए आज्ञा चक्र पे आ गई है। हाँ !

01:13:22.010 --> 01:13:30.190
[ASIDE -If it sucks in. Better?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.]

01:13:33.624 --> 01:13:36.324
Shri Mataji: Hmm, it's sucked.

01:13:40.596 --> 01:13:45.606
बोझा जो है बेकार सब लोग लिए हुए हैं।
जैसे कि किसी देहाती से कहा गया

01:13:45.613 --> 01:13:51.863
कि, "तुम प्लेन में जाते वक्त इतना बोझा मत ले
जाओ," तो अपने सर पर ले कर बैठ गया।

01:13:51.863 --> 01:13:57.095
इसी प्रकार आप भी बोझा लिए सर पे बैठे हैं।
करने-धरने वाले तो सब दूसरे ही हैं।

01:13:57.095 --> 01:14:04.402
हाँ! करता और भोक्ता दूसरे ही हैं।
आप बेकार में ही परेशान हैं।

01:14:04.606 --> 01:14:10.786
आ रही हाथ में ठंडक? कितने लोगों के हाथ में
ठंडक आ रही है?

01:14:10.786 --> 01:14:13.662
हाथ में या सर में? हाथ ऊपर उठाएँ - दोनों हाथ।

01:14:17.087 --> 01:14:24.727
अधिक लोगों के आ गई है - अधिकतर।
सरदारजीयों के पहले आनी चाहिए।

01:14:28.292 --> 01:14:33.162
निराकार की बात जिसने की उसको पहले
वाईब्रेशन्स मिलना चाहिए।

01:14:33.839 --> 01:14:45.001
ठीक है।
[APPLAUSE]

01:14:53.183 --> 01:14:59.773
सहज योगी: आप सब लोग बैठे रहें अभी आगे
कोई न आये। थोड़ी देर में श्री माताजी
जायेंगीं, फिर आप।

01:14:59.773 --> 01:15:05.756
जिन लोगों को देखना है, स्टेज पर आ जाएँगे,
सहज योगी देख लेंगे।आप बैठे रहिए आराम से।

01:15:54.665 --> 01:16:01.615
सहज योगी: कृपया जो लोग आज ही आये हैं, वो
श्री माताजी का फोटो ले लें, ताकि फोटो से ही
