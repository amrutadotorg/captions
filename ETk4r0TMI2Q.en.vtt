00:00:03.493 --> 00:00:11.993
"YOU ARE YOUR OWN MASTER"

00:00:17.608 --> 00:00:21.992
These days, Kali Yuga is the modern times,

00:00:22.193 --> 00:00:24.938
what was the Kali Yuga, the days
of confusion, is over,

00:00:25.139 --> 00:00:31.398
and is called as Krita Yuga, means where
this living force will act,

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.195
and this living force has to act through
you. You become the medium

00:00:36.396 --> 00:00:40.494
of that living force. Actually you become
the master of that.

00:00:41.302 --> 00:00:47.628
How it happens is automatically
by the grace of God it works out.

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.104
You cannot sell anything that is the grace
of God. What is the value of that?

00:00:52.305 --> 00:00:54.963
On this point only many people discard
Sahaja Yoga

00:00:55.148 --> 00:00:58.721
because they think that it cannot be sold,
so it must be useless.

00:00:58.922 --> 00:01:04.167
It is so invaluable that you cannot pay
for it.

00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:10.745
Now the rising of the Kundalini has to take
place, first of all.

00:01:10.946 --> 00:01:14.768
But with these three advantages,
the fourth advantage is the highest:

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:22.651
that you become the Spirit. The Spirit
is the one who is the master in you.

00:01:22.852 --> 00:01:26.932
So you become your own master,
you become your own guru.

00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:31.049
Nobody has to tell you ‘do this’ or
‘do that’; you are guided.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.260
Because as soon as the Kundalini rises,

00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:38.565
you start feeling the cool breeze
in your hands.

00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:43.970
And these are giving you a new vibrations,
a new dimension

00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:46.321
by which you know whether to do
this or not.

00:01:46.522 --> 00:01:51.134
For example, you want to do something;
you want to buy a book.

00:01:51.335 --> 00:01:54.743
You don’t have to decide about it:
as soon as you go near the book,

00:01:54.944 --> 00:01:59.446
either it will give you cool breeze,
or it may make you hot,

00:01:59.647 --> 00:02:02.509
or may little bit burn also if it’s
a horrid one,

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.594
and you don’t want to have that at any
cost, you want to have the cool breeze

00:02:05.795 --> 00:02:08.938
because you enjoy it. So you just give up.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.866
You just give up things without anybody
telling you,

00:02:13.067 --> 00:02:15.298
because your vibrations tell you.

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:20.061
The Spirit that is now shining (in)
your attention, tells you,

00:02:20.262 --> 00:02:24.421
and you start understanding that now
I have become my own guru,

00:02:24.622 --> 00:02:29.585
because your guru is sitting inside you
as the Spirit.

00:02:29.786 --> 00:02:34.920
It has not yet manifested in your attention
and that’s why you are worried.

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:39.163
But just it manifests, and once
it manifests you are amazed,

00:02:39.364 --> 00:02:42.241
that you yourself will have become
a guru of yourself.

00:02:42.442 --> 00:02:46.413
You don’t need anybody else to tell you,
but you can do it yourself.

00:02:46.614 --> 00:02:50.804
You can find out yourself. Nobody has
to give any explanation,

00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:58.139
or correction, or anything, you just
start improving yourself.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.467
Automatically it works, and little bit,
if you know how to decode it,

00:03:03.668 --> 00:03:09.452
and how to work it out, your problems,
you just manage it.

00:03:09.653 --> 00:03:15.139
You become yourself a guru.
That’s the thing you have to be.

00:03:15.786 --> 00:03:20.382
So, today the master within us, within us
is the Spirit.

00:03:20.583 --> 00:03:24.507
But before Realization, we are not
the master

00:03:24.707 --> 00:03:29.561
because the master has not come
in our conscious mind.

00:03:29.762 --> 00:03:32.482
It is not expressing in our conscious mind.

00:03:32.683 --> 00:03:39.975
In the sense that we are not empowered
by Its powers.

00:03:40.176 --> 00:03:46.550
The Spirit exists; It has Its own powers.
But we haven’t felt those powers within us.

00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:49.497
Once we feel the powers of the Spirit,

00:03:49.698 --> 00:03:54.333
we are empowered by our own powers
which are there.

00:03:54.502 --> 00:03:59.385
The powers are within us. These are
our own powers.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.840
We don’t have to borrow from anyone,
ask from anyone, they are in ourselves.

00:04:04.041 --> 00:04:08.736
The Spirit is within us - only thing
that Spirit has to give light

00:04:08.937 --> 00:04:17.044
in our, in our consciousness. It has
to come in our consciousness.

00:04:17.245 --> 00:04:20.991
In simple medical terminology we can
see, say

00:04:21.192 --> 00:04:28.458
that the Spirit must manifest Itself
in our central nervous system,

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:31.275
in our central nervous system.

00:04:32.065 --> 00:04:34.669
Is very simple. That you become master
of yourself

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.099
and you master the disease also,
you master everything.

00:04:42.408 --> 00:04:45.387
Because the master is within you,
it has not come

00:04:45.588 --> 00:04:48.155
in your conscious mind is the only link
is left,

00:04:48.356 --> 00:04:52.356
and when that happens Yoga takes place,
union takes place.

00:04:52.557 --> 00:05:00.013
We should now completely keep ourselves
limited to Self Realization,

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.833
about God I’ll tell next time.
Self-Realization means

00:05:04.034 --> 00:05:08.778
to bring your Spirit into your conscious
mind.

00:05:09.916 --> 00:05:12.630
And that’s what you have to become,
the master.

00:05:12.831 --> 00:05:17.513
And that mastery is very simple because
it’s all built within you,

00:05:17.698 --> 00:05:20.194
just it has to be connected.

00:05:20.395 --> 00:05:24.743
Like, anything like a television set
is to be connected to the mains,

00:05:24.944 --> 00:05:27.100
it’s all built in, it’s there, it just
starts working.

00:05:27.301 --> 00:05:31.264
In the same way, you are that,
you are that.

00:05:31.465 --> 00:05:35.024
Just it is to be connected. Whatever
may be your caste,

00:05:35.225 --> 00:05:40.243
community, race, nationality, shapes,
heights –

00:05:40.444 --> 00:05:45.133
anything, whatever you may be – makes
no difference because all of you have got

00:05:45.334 --> 00:05:50.085
this great thing within you, this power
of a rebirth

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:56.616
and you are to be born again, and you
will be born again. Why not today?

00:05:59.522 --> 00:06:07.948
When we talk about realization one has
to know,

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:14.607
first of all, that we have to have patience
with ourselves.

00:06:15.643 --> 00:06:21.293
I know some people [who] don't feel
so good,

00:06:21.493 --> 00:06:29.649
some people still have sicknesses, some
people don't even feel vibrations sometimes.

00:06:30.837 --> 00:06:35.577
Have patience with yourselves!
When you become your own guru...

00:06:35.778 --> 00:06:42.912
first thing as the guru has patience
with his or her disciple,

00:06:43.113 --> 00:06:47.050
you must have patience with yourself.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:56.534
In that patience you will learn

00:06:56.735 --> 00:07:05.389
that you can tolerate so many things
without any trouble.

00:07:06.633 --> 00:07:09.402
There’s, say, one person who goes on
grudging:

00:07:09.603 --> 00:07:13.441
"Oh, this is not good, that is not good"...

00:07:18.174 --> 00:07:22.722
Because they have no patience
with themselves.

00:07:23.333 --> 00:07:30.803
If you have patience with yourself,
everything you’ll accept.

00:07:32.245 --> 00:07:37.056
Wherever you are, you are with your Self
because you are realized souls.

00:07:37.257 --> 00:07:44.388
So you won't frustrate, you’ll not
get angry,

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:52.748
and also you will not go on grumbling
and grudging,

00:07:52.949 --> 00:07:56.532
because you are enjoying your Self.

00:07:57.384 --> 00:08:01.892
So, to develop the Guru principle
within you, first of all

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.838
you must develop yourself, fully.

00:08:06.039 --> 00:08:11.057
Now, how to develop yourself for Guru
principle, one must see.

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:18.143
We have got the ten principles within you,
as I told you before,

00:08:18.344 --> 00:08:21.900
and we should develop these all ten
principles in such a way

00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:26.000
that we stand out from others.

00:08:26.415 --> 00:08:30.587
There should be Absolute Truths within you.

00:08:33.475 --> 00:08:38.829
So much so, that you should manifest them.
And all these truths have powers.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:45.165
By every truth that is within you
established.

00:08:45.366 --> 00:08:49.790
You don’t have to do anything, they
work out themselves.

00:08:50.069 --> 00:08:55.243
So, first of all, you must get your chakras
all right;

00:08:55.444 --> 00:08:59.258
on the chakras, you must put
your attention;

00:08:59.459 --> 00:09:04.525
after the Samadhi state, you will start
opening them out properly.

00:09:04.726 --> 00:09:07.978
Clear them out. Know what are
the chakras that are bad.

00:09:08.179 --> 00:09:12.019
I’ve  seen people who have very bad
few chakras,

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:16.370
and many good chakras, but they will be
only enjoying the good chakras

00:09:16.571 --> 00:09:20.141
and will not worry about the bad ones.
Pay attention to your bad chakras.

00:09:20.342 --> 00:09:25.268
Cleanse them, cleanse them.
Put all your attention to that.

00:09:27.037 --> 00:09:30.893
But it will happen. It will happen,
once you get your Realization,

00:09:31.094 --> 00:09:34.690
the attention will be very, very nicely
placed.

00:09:34.891 --> 00:09:40.901
Now, when you people know that this
has happened to you,

00:09:41.102 --> 00:09:50.026
and when you become the master, you know
the brake and the accelerator in you.

00:09:50.227 --> 00:09:55.495
But still, actually you are not the master,
you are still the driver.

00:09:55.696 --> 00:09:58.885
And when you are a driver, you
automatically do it driving,

00:09:59.086 --> 00:10:01.800
but still one should not say that you are
a driver.

00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:07.315
You know the balancing of it, you know
how to maneuver it, how to act.

00:10:07.516 --> 00:10:12.940
But then, what happens? To become
the master, what do you do?

00:10:13.141 --> 00:10:18.850
This Realization takes place. Then you
become the master, and you see the driver,

00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:23.093
you see the accelerator, and you see
the brake in yourself.

00:10:23.294 --> 00:10:25.679
And you just enjoy like a master.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.562
When you become the master, you cannot
be slave of anything.

00:10:29.763 --> 00:10:34.437
No more slavery, the real freedom lies
in becoming the master of yourself.

00:10:34.638 --> 00:10:37.273
No use mastering others, just master
yourself.

00:10:37.474 --> 00:10:42.015
But that mastering cannot be done
by lecturing or by brainwashing,

00:10:42.216 --> 00:10:45.413
or by talking to you, but it’s a happening
that has to take place,

00:10:45.614 --> 00:10:50.023
the Kundalini has to rise and has
to give you Realization.

00:10:50.224 --> 00:10:55.609
This, unless and until this happens
we should not say that we know.

00:10:55.810 --> 00:11:01.140
Know, knowledge - is not, when we are
not one with the Divine.

00:11:01.341 --> 00:11:07.064
It’s like a machine or you can say
telephone not connected.

00:11:07.265 --> 00:11:10.806
We have to get our connection first,
establish the connection,

00:11:11.007 --> 00:11:14.275
and then we become the knower.

00:11:14.476 --> 00:11:18.525
And the knowledge becomes a part
and parcel of you.

00:11:18.726 --> 00:11:21.009
But this cannot happen to stupid people.

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:24.922
It’s not meant for stupid at all, neither
for the cowardly.

00:11:25.123 --> 00:11:31.555
It is meant for people who are courageous,
who are people of wisdom,

00:11:31.756 --> 00:11:36.290
who are not given to nonsensical things
easily.

00:11:36.491 --> 00:11:39.829
That`s why in Sahaja Yoga there are
two forces working all the time.

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:42.040
You may get your Realization today here,

00:11:42.241 --> 00:11:45.563
but I won’t say that you’ll sustain it.
I won’t guarantee that.

00:11:45.764 --> 00:11:50.547
The reason is, we have two forces, one is
centripetal and another is centrifugal.

00:11:50.748 --> 00:11:54.805
By one force you are attracted towards it,
by another force you’re thrown out.

00:11:55.006 --> 00:11:59.001
Because you have come out of matter.
And the matter tries to drag you down.

00:11:59.202 --> 00:12:02.173
You have to master it, in such a way
that the Spirit

00:12:02.374 --> 00:12:06.540
sits on the top of the matter. And
the matter doesn’t dominate you anymore.

00:12:06.741 --> 00:12:11.665
And for that you have to meditate,
and you will be in meditation.

00:12:11.866 --> 00:12:14.954
It’s simple thing to be done, there’s
nothing difficult.

00:12:15.154 --> 00:12:18.258
Sahaja Yoga is the simplest method.

00:12:20.304 --> 00:12:24.090
Now you must know that the Spirit
is your guide,

00:12:24.291 --> 00:12:28.121
that you are your own guru, you are
your own master.

00:12:28.322 --> 00:12:35.041
For this you have to put this right hand
just on the left-hand side of your stomach

00:12:35.249 --> 00:12:41.275
to nourish your guru principle.
Left hand side.

00:12:41.476 --> 00:12:46.248
At this point you have to say,

00:12:47.401 --> 00:12:53.783
with full confidence, “Mother, I am
my own master.”

00:12:53.984 --> 00:12:57.127
“Mother, I am my own guru.”

00:12:57.328 --> 00:13:01.151
“Mother, I am my own guide.”

00:13:01.352 --> 00:13:06.485
Say it ten times. With full confidence.

00:13:14.638 --> 00:13:17.202
See the vibrations will improve.

00:13:17.403 --> 00:13:21.177
Now don’t think of any other gurus.
Forget them.

00:13:21.378 --> 00:13:25.170
You are your own guru. You don’t
need a guru.

00:13:25.371 --> 00:13:28.061
You are a saint.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:36.694
The Spirit is going to guide you, your
vibratory awareness is going to guide you.

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:46.115
Now in our mantras we say that,
“Mother, I am my own Guru.”

00:13:46.316 --> 00:13:50.361
But, saying that, do we realise that:

00:13:50.562 --> 00:13:57.354
if I am my own Guru, this “I” and
“my Guru,”

00:13:57.555 --> 00:14:01.697
between the two, what have I achieved?

00:14:01.898 --> 00:14:06.973
Where am I? Can I guide myself?

00:14:07.174 --> 00:14:13.229
Have I got the light of the Spirit on my
attention so well established and manifested

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:19.515
that I can guide myself and guide others
later on?

00:14:19.716 --> 00:14:24.915
First of all, in the Guru principle it is
important

00:14:25.116 --> 00:14:30.040
that you see to yourself –
the introspection:

00:14:30.241 --> 00:14:36.567
Can I be my own Guru? Have I become
my own Guru?

00:14:38.698 --> 00:14:45.126
So, in the introspection you find out
what’s gone wrong with you,

00:14:46.316 --> 00:14:50.258
how you are made this way.

00:14:51.537 --> 00:15:01.168
“What’s wrong in my own personality
it has come from all the surroundings

00:15:01.369 --> 00:15:06.003
and the way people have been putting
ideas into my head.”

00:15:07.274 --> 00:15:11.089
You should have your own ideas;

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:15.419
you shouldn’t worry what Plato said and
what Socrates said and what this thing said

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:19.177
What do you think?

00:15:20.862 --> 00:15:23.801
After all, you are enlightened people.

00:15:24.908 --> 00:15:30.449
And when you start, you see, seeing
this way yourself, then you’ll be amazed

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:35.595
a kind of a sweet humor about yourself
develops.

00:15:35.796 --> 00:15:41.627
And you really become a very interesting,
magnetic personality,

00:15:45.047 --> 00:15:49.805
and a very enjoyable person, extremely
enjoyable.

00:15:50.006 --> 00:15:53.283
Everybody will seek your company.

00:15:53.484 --> 00:15:59.720
This is what is the sign of your Guru
Principle being enlightened.

00:15:59.905 --> 00:16:02.845
Of course, they have said that you should
get detachment;

00:16:03.053 --> 00:16:07.025
you should not have any attachment
to this and that and that and that.

00:16:07.226 --> 00:16:13.595
This is all talking. But actually,
only introspection

00:16:13.796 --> 00:16:24.994
and assumption or, we can say,
the knowledge of your own depth,

00:16:25.195 --> 00:16:29.274
itself, will give you that feeling.

00:16:30.499 --> 00:16:36.406
If you have that knowledge that
I’m a Sahaja yogi,

00:16:36.607 --> 00:16:42.633
and my depth of divinity is so great,

00:16:44.563 --> 00:16:54.964
that itself will be more than sufficient
for you to exist as the topmost guru.

00:16:55.539 --> 00:16:59.790
So everywhere you start seeing
Sahaja Yoga, when your heart

00:16:59.991 --> 00:17:03.555
knows what your brain knows.

00:17:03.756 --> 00:17:08.714
I’ve known people who know all the mantras
very well, everything very well

00:17:08.915 --> 00:17:13.589
and all that, but in the heart.
So put it in the heart.

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:22.347
In Sahaja Yoga the guru is not through
his brain but through his heart.

00:17:23.446 --> 00:17:27.133
May God bless you all.
