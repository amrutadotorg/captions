WEBVTT

00:01.846 --> 00:04.545
First, I’ll speak in English language,

00:04.746 --> 00:10.333
because we have so many people from foreign countries,

00:10.667 --> 00:12.865
and especially from Madras (Chennai)

00:13.048 --> 00:18.161
and also from Kerala,

00:18.362 --> 00:22.050
Hyderabad and Bangalore.

00:22.931 --> 00:25.801
All these people have come here,

00:26.002 --> 00:28.846
and I don’t know what other people are here,

00:29.211 --> 00:34.707
who have come from South

00:34.908 --> 00:42.048
and who do not yet understand Hindi language.

00:52.029 --> 00:56.654
This Shivaratri has a special meaning, I think,

00:57.210 --> 01:00.755
because

01:04.061 --> 01:11.242
there is so much –

01:11.443 --> 01:16.656
if you read any newspaper in the morning,

01:16.857 --> 01:23.123
such horrible news is there

01:23.385 --> 01:28.969
about the people who are trying to create

01:29.334 --> 01:36.765
all kinds of violence, corruption

01:36.966 --> 01:41.609
and immoral behaviour.

01:41.810 --> 01:49.688
You are surprised how, these
days, it is so full of

01:50.251 --> 01:55.250
all these criminalities going round us.

01:56.528 --> 02:03.321
This is the time, as if come, for

02:03.346 --> 02:08.820
the “Taandav nrutya” (cosmic dance) of Shri Shiva.

02:09.956 --> 02:15.083
Otherwise, one feels things cannot improve.

02:15.679 --> 02:20.022
It is His anger, if it starts,

02:20.848 --> 02:26.080
throwing wrath on people of this character and this type.

02:27.366 --> 02:34.216
I don’t know how anyone can save from His wrath.

02:35.039 --> 02:38.940
He’s a God who is full of love,

02:40.067 --> 02:44.299
full of tremendous compassion,

02:45.609 --> 02:57.852
but also the- another extreme of very destroying character.

02:59.024 --> 03:01.026
He can destroy the whole world.

03:02.749 --> 03:09.544
He can finish all the creatures that have been created

03:11.092 --> 03:14.420
if He gets into a temper.

03:20.311 --> 03:22.495
You all must be knowing the story,

03:23.058 --> 03:27.888
how He went into ecstasy.

03:29.866 --> 03:35.806
There was a devil who had taken a form of a child.

03:36.007 --> 03:38.974
And a mother cannot kill the child,

03:40.537 --> 03:43.406
she cannot. And She thought

03:43.863 --> 03:51.699
She won’t be able to save the world from the wrath

03:53.267 --> 03:56.524
or anger of Shiva

03:57.445 --> 04:02.050
if He sees the whole world destroyed by this devil.

04:08.712 --> 04:14.013
So She withdrew from Her act

04:15.148 --> 04:21.332
of sacrificing the child or killing the child

04:22.754 --> 04:26.231
and it was Shiva who took over.

04:27.716 --> 04:33.869
And He just stood on the back of the child and killed him.

04:34.535 --> 04:36.234
That child was a devil.

04:37.537 --> 04:41.244
And so, He saved the world

04:42.428 --> 04:46.117
from the destruction of this horrible rakshasa.

04:47.561 --> 04:50.365
And then He danced with joy.

04:51.420 --> 04:56.263
That’s what they call as a cosmic, cosmic joy.

04:58.017 --> 05:00.231
Many people don’t understand why

05:00.652 --> 05:02.923
He’s standing on top of a little child,

05:03.923 --> 05:05.503
but the reason was this.

05:06.352 --> 05:10.378
So, even people may camouflage today

05:11.251 --> 05:16.536
as small children, as very innocent people,

05:17.108 --> 05:24.832
as very holy gurus,

05:26.525 --> 05:28.890
Shiva can destroy all of them.

05:30.986 --> 05:33.695
This destruction has already started

05:35.076 --> 05:38.576
and is going with a full speed, I think, all over,

05:40.079 --> 05:42.491
through so many things that are happening:

05:43.340 --> 05:48.564
we have got hurricanes,

05:50.723 --> 05:53.993
storms, earthquakes,

05:55.560 --> 05:57.019
many accidents,

05:58.186 --> 06:01.765
and so many destructive things are working out

06:02.463 --> 06:06.561
which are the outcome of Kalaki [Kalki] incarnation.

06:07.847 --> 06:09.632
But, at the same time,

06:10.601 --> 06:14.801
there is another work going on, of the same incarnation:

06:15.801 --> 06:18.714
is the resurrection of the people.

06:19.762 --> 06:22.462
Such people can never be hurt,

06:23.375 --> 06:25.851
nothing can happen to them.

06:26.716 --> 06:28.470
They’ll be always saved.

06:29.272 --> 06:31.425
Everything will be saved for them

06:32.036 --> 06:37.396
because they are under the protection of their Mother.

06:40.224 --> 06:44.078
Now the problem is

06:44.554 --> 06:50.610
how can we the Sahaja Yogis deal with such people

06:50.811 --> 06:56.626
and to see that they go out of the circulation of evolution?

06:59.507 --> 07:02.716
Only solution is raising the Kundalini.

07:04.556 --> 07:07.815
If you raise the Kundalini of human beings,

07:09.370 --> 07:13.386
who are even very bad and gone cases,

07:13.982 --> 07:19.519
either they will be destroyed or they will be saved

07:19.789 --> 07:22.132
and they’ll become good people.

07:23.465 --> 07:26.301
They will stop all this

07:29.000 --> 07:33.496
horrible things they are thinking and planning in their heads

07:34.400 --> 07:38.948
and they’ll become really very, very good people.

07:39.986 --> 07:43.004
It may fail in some cases – I wouldn’t say

07:43.205 --> 07:47.101
that Sahaja Yoga would be successful in every case.

07:48.037 --> 07:50.580
But if Sahaja Yogis meditate

07:51.159 --> 07:55.199
and keep themselves in complete peace

07:55.953 --> 08:00.947
and also completely surrendered,

08:01.915 --> 08:03.963
nothing can happen to them.

08:05.767 --> 08:09.544
They are always protected and you all have an experience

08:09.892 --> 08:10.965
of that protection.

08:12.338 --> 08:15.753
But first you should have faith in yourself

08:16.547 --> 08:19.943
and complete surrendering to Sahaja Yoga.

08:21.388 --> 08:24.247
We are so many Sahaja Yogis sitting here,

08:25.565 --> 08:29.620
mostly from North, South, East and West of India,

08:30.065 --> 08:32.265
and also from other foreign countries.

08:33.583 --> 08:38.111
Every country is, today, under the,

08:39.817 --> 08:43.087
we should say, under the control of these negative forces.

08:44.198 --> 08:48.982
What we have to do is to make people positive

08:49.665 --> 08:51.443
through Kundalini awakening.

08:51.951 --> 08:53.665
This you all can do.

08:54.416 --> 08:55.659
This you can achieve.

08:56.357 --> 09:00.715
For this, you don’t have to do something special.

09:01.461 --> 09:06.407
In day-to-day life, you can achieve it and you should do it.

09:06.772 --> 09:10.956
This is the only thing that is needed today,

09:11.068 --> 09:14.780
is to transform people and you all can do it,

09:15.391 --> 09:22.179
all of you can do it in a very sincere and a good manner.

09:23.243 --> 09:28.195
You don’t have to get to temper, jump at people,

09:28.862 --> 09:30.872
get angry with rude people,

09:31.245 --> 09:34.999
but with peaceful attitude, you should achieve it;

09:35.950 --> 09:43.286
so that this wrathful temperament of Shiva,

09:43.461 --> 09:46.670
as they say, the third eye of Shiva won’t open.

09:47.659 --> 09:49.781
That’s something horrible.

09:50.773 --> 09:53.674
We all can do it in a very constructive manner,

09:54.316 --> 09:56.666
extremely in a constructive manner.

09:57.491 --> 10:00.912
So what we should do is to, first of all,

10:01.261 --> 10:07.643
establish our own Shiva principle, is the principle of joy,

10:11.167 --> 10:12.913
principle of love

10:14.564 --> 10:17.388
and principle of Truth, I should say.

10:19.396 --> 10:22.237
There are big problems, also,

10:23.046 --> 10:26.041
because people have no idea

10:26.898 --> 10:34.495
as to Shiva’s global temperament.

10:37.892 --> 10:42.442
For example, I have heard people
quarrelling and fighting over

10:42.847 --> 10:46.220
Shiva principle and Vishnu principle.

10:48.404 --> 10:51.214
Now, Vishnu is there, His power is there

10:52.326 --> 10:55.789
for you to rise up to this Shiva principle.

10:58.273 --> 11:03.117
Both are not different, one is supplementary for another.

11:04.244 --> 11:06.784
But if you go on fighting even on that point,

11:07.276 --> 11:08.602
I can’t understand.

11:09.990 --> 11:13.041
You cannot please Shiva without Vishnu.

11:14.731 --> 11:20.590
And if you cannot stick to Shiva’s principle,

11:20.987 --> 11:24.051
if you have not understood the Vishnu principle –

11:26.577 --> 11:31.172
Kundalini itself rises through the Sushumna Nadi.

11:32.460 --> 11:37.277
She is the principle, She is the “tattwa” of Shiva.

11:38.702 --> 11:42.777
And She rises through the channel

11:43.087 --> 11:47.931
that is made by Vishnu out of evolutionary process.

11:49.343 --> 11:54.195
So how can you do away with one of Them?

11:55.131 --> 11:58.187
One is the road, another is the destination.

11:59.687 --> 12:03.205
So I hope you understand how important it is

12:03.856 --> 12:06.824
that your centers should be corrected,

12:07.388 --> 12:09.993
your road should be alright,

12:10.787 --> 12:13.588
that your Sushumna should be cleared,

12:13.937 --> 12:16.813
because we are “madhyamargis”:

12:17.575 --> 12:19.670
we have to go by the centre,

12:20.733 --> 12:24.774
by the central path and we have to have the balance,

12:25.401 --> 12:28.559
not to go to the left and not to go to the right.

12:29.567 --> 12:32.338
This balance we must keep

12:32.539 --> 12:34.645
and go on moving until you reach

12:35.145 --> 12:39.193
your “talu bhaag” (Brahmarandhra) where sits Sadashiva.

12:40.961 --> 12:44.838
You can experience it, you can see for yourself.

12:45.663 --> 12:49.105
Whatever I am saying, you know it very well.

12:49.566 --> 12:53.899
Only thing is when I am telling you, you can verify.

12:55.439 --> 12:58.719
Sahaja Yoga can be verified very easily,

12:59.517 --> 13:05.308
and you know that, that you now know the only truth.

13:07.078 --> 13:10.840
The truth which is absolute.

13:11.872 --> 13:17.183
This is also the principle which starts showing results

13:17.564 --> 13:21.333
when these two powers meet.

13:23.460 --> 13:27.788
It is very surprising that, when these two powers meet,

13:28.653 --> 13:33.812
or when you reach Shiva principle through the Vishnu principle,

13:34.351 --> 13:35.981
then you realize

13:38.489 --> 13:44.232
that these two powers are so complimentary

13:45.176 --> 13:52.115
and so much related to each other.

13:53.250 --> 13:56.591
There’s no difference, in a way,

13:57.663 --> 13:59.387
between these two powers.

13:59.959 --> 14:06.141
And, so, keep your road “madhyamarga” [central channel] clean

14:06.610 --> 14:09.350
and let the Kundalini pass through it.

14:10.749 --> 14:13.374
When the Kundalini will pass through it,

14:14.159 --> 14:20.876
you’ll be amazed that the same Kundalini

14:21.077 --> 14:23.384
is going through the Vishnu path

14:23.585 --> 14:28.741
and reaching at the lotus feet of Shiva.

14:33.712 --> 14:40.505
All of you recognise Shivji, and He is worshiped.

14:41.925 --> 14:45.933
But, you do not know the different aspects of His qualities.

14:46.551 --> 14:49.942
That is why, many times you make mistakes.

14:51.978 --> 14:56.223
The most important form of  Shivji is bliss and joy.

14:57.357 --> 15:03.214
And this joy is spread everywhere in subtle and subtlest forms.

15:03.532 --> 15:09.468
But, until you become spiritually subtle to absorb this,

15:09.755 --> 15:13.929
you will neither be able to see this nor understand this.

15:14.453 --> 15:16.649
He resides in everything,

15:16.850 --> 15:22.121
He resides in everything

15:26.449 --> 15:31.664
and in a way we can say He creates a joyful realm.

15:31.865 --> 15:36.992
And when you look around in that realm, you find

15:37.193 --> 15:40.217
that you have been transformed into something else.

15:40.464 --> 15:44.582
Other people find happiness in different things.

15:45.900 --> 15:51.558
Many people find happiness in destroying themselves.

15:52.728 --> 15:56.696
By taking to different wrong paths,

15:57.351 --> 16:03.223
people think that if we go against the Spirit, we can find happiness.

16:04.448 --> 16:10.361
But, the Atma [Spirit], Which is verily Shivji,

16:12.752 --> 16:15.776
finds joy in a different way.

16:17.047 --> 16:20.983
And only that can touch our heart.

16:21.770 --> 16:28.222
Like, there are a lot of people who are immersed in material things.

16:28.947 --> 16:33.581
Some take to alchohol,  some indulge into sinful activities,

16:33.852 --> 16:36.091
they keep doing all wrong things

16:36.432 --> 16:39.717
and they think that there is a lot of happiness in that.

16:40.211 --> 16:41.446
But it is not so.

16:41.978 --> 16:46.398
gradually they get destroyed and slowly, they are finished.

16:47.968 --> 16:52.750
But, Shivji is the one who comforts us,

16:53.147 --> 16:57.322
He gives us peace and He gives us joy.

16:58.967 --> 17:05.983
And when the Power of Shiva and the Power of Vishnu,

17:06.472 --> 17:10.246
– like Kundalini and Sushumna Nadi;

17:11.056 --> 17:17.143
when unite with each other, you get the absolute Truth.

17:17.959 --> 17:20.349
absolute Truth.

17:20.550 --> 17:26.706
Such that you cannot, in any way,

17:26.907 --> 17:29.072
refuse to accept this Truth.

17:29.273 --> 17:31.528
Because it is the absolute Truth.

17:32.198 --> 17:35.769
Which you can feel on your fingertips, on your hands.

17:37.548 --> 17:40.190
You will have many types of experiences,

17:40.624 --> 17:45.552
by which you will understand that in the absolute Truth

17:47.055 --> 17:50.377
there is not even an iota of untruth.

17:50.578 --> 17:58.337
That is known within you; you can know it, understand it.

17:58.981 --> 18:02.322
This is the gift given by the Kundalini.

18:03.445 --> 18:07.198
This means that the Kundalini, which is the Shakti [Power] of Shiva,

18:07.418 --> 18:12.512
when She rises through the central channel,

18:13.141 --> 18:17.954
She awakens all the chakras, aligns them in its entirety,

18:18.155 --> 18:20.355
and integrates them

18:20.556 --> 18:24.914
Who looks after that Shakti [Power]?

18:25.748 --> 18:28.597
We can say that Shri Vishnu looks after Her,

18:29.329 --> 18:32.200
because She moves in the central path of Vishnu.

18:32.522 --> 18:35.093
And then She reaches the Brahmarandhra,

18:36.966 --> 18:38.712
and appears there.

18:39.710 --> 18:43.027
And on reaching there we can understand that

18:43.560 --> 18:47.508
Her journey is now complete.

18:48.365 --> 18:52.506
So we can see so much cooperation and understanding among them.

18:53.923 --> 18:55.536
But, we people are there,

18:56.823 --> 19:01.228
now a type of disease has come that everyone is running after money.

19:01.938 --> 19:05.493
Running after money has become a very peculier disease.

19:05.934 --> 19:08.576
And for that we are willing to do anything,

19:08.926 --> 19:10.822
We take support from anything,

19:11.029 --> 19:13.229
Even in Sahaja Yoga people do that.

19:13.531 --> 19:18.014
The reason for this is that some sort of defect has crept into us.

19:19.501 --> 19:22.858
A lot of negativities have accumulated in us.

19:23.743 --> 19:28.109
And these negativities can be cleansed only by Kundalini.

19:28.916 --> 19:36.972
But, until you do not become one with the Kundalini,

19:37.173 --> 19:40.961
and through meditation if you do not develop It,

19:42.255 --> 19:45.874
then you cannot reach that state where,

19:46.748 --> 19:50.207
the Power is manifested in you,

19:50.685 --> 19:55.771
the Power which is the truth, it is joy giving, peace giving -

19:56.970 --> 19:58.890
– a weakness remains in it.

19:59.510 --> 20:02.838
When the Kundalini rises, She cleanses everything.

20:04.155 --> 20:07.226
With the Power of Shivji, everything gets cleansed.

20:07.738 --> 20:11.525
But, still some people because of their old habits

20:11.859 --> 20:14.726
or because of wrong ideals, suffer a lot.

20:17.970 --> 20:21.678
And those people – with whatever that is wrong,

20:22.748 --> 20:25.946
whatever bad habits of theirs,

20:27.363 --> 20:32.632
even with the slightest temptation they fall from their ascent.

20:34.371 --> 20:38.893
Even if an atom of negativity is left within us,

20:39.266 --> 20:42.107
remaining within,

20:42.290 --> 20:46.788
We can fall due to that, and get completely destroyed

20:47.873 --> 20:52.215
Those who come to the Pujas and meditate,

20:52.519 --> 20:55.334
those people always make progress.

20:56.426 --> 21:03.719
If there is no peace, even a tree cannot survive, it cannot grow.

21:03.920 --> 21:06.680
Even germination cannot take place.

21:06.881 --> 21:10.554
That is why, within you,

21:10.755 --> 21:15.430
if you don't have this meditative quality, don't have these ideals,

21:15.631 --> 21:18.263
that we will never go towards downfall,

21:18.464 --> 21:21.946
we will not succumb to any bad habits,

21:22.147 --> 21:27.072
then you should attend all the pujas – as many as possible

21:27.273 --> 21:29.996
and you should be in meditation.

21:30.197 --> 21:33.453
Because now you have the right to do puja.

21:33.654 --> 21:35.606
Everyone doesn’t have the right to do Pujas.

21:35.734 --> 21:37.603
Anyone and everyone goes to do puja.

21:37.826 --> 21:40.444
But when there is no connection,

21:40.659 --> 21:43.559
then how can you be authorised to do a puja?

21:44.153 --> 21:45.978
But many people think-

21:46.146 --> 21:49.876
go to this temple or that temple; go to this guru or that guru.

21:50.066 --> 21:51.202
Nothing comes out of that.

21:51.378 --> 21:53.108
You are your own guru,

21:53.299 --> 21:57.068
and only you can introspect and think, ’what is the problem in me’?

21:57.396 --> 22:03.848
’In our heart are we completely accepting Sahaja Yoga or not'?

22:04.827 --> 22:07.659
I have seen a lot of people come into Sahaja Yoga

22:07.816 --> 22:12.363
and after reaching a certain height, they fall.

22:12.962 --> 22:16.025
The higher they rise, the lower they fall.

22:16.691 --> 22:20.826
The reason is that the hidden tendencies in you,

22:21.175 --> 22:25.937
have somehow become active, without you being aware of it.

22:27.506 --> 22:29.743
That is why you must pay attention

22:30.053 --> 22:33.990
– ’hope I am not falling into wrong things’,

22:34.764 --> 22:41.336
or ’hope, I am not doing anything wrong which is against Sahaja?

22:42.133 --> 22:47.691
or ’have some bad motives arisen in me that

22:48.048 --> 22:52.046
I have come to Sahaja with the idea of making money?’

22:52.247 --> 22:55.588
Or ,’I have come into Sahaja Yoga to do something bad?’

22:55.987 --> 22:59.112
Our attention should be towards these things.

22:59.313 --> 23:02.789
The best thing is that, whatever activities of Sahaja are there –

23:02.956 --> 23:07.877
or however it is possible in Sahaja, like meditation, worship, etc.

23:08.078 --> 23:12.246
you should do all that and establish individually

23:12.447 --> 23:16.960
within you, a special type of state

23:19.354 --> 23:23.084
which we call as

23:23.719 --> 23:26.666
individuality or as totality.

23:26.867 --> 23:28.224
Once you are established individually,

23:28.425 --> 23:30.949
then you can become a collective person.

23:31.150 --> 23:32.761
Those who do not attend collectivity,

23:33.149 --> 23:36.769
they cannot also grow individually.

23:37.176 --> 23:38.602
This I have seen.

23:38.856 --> 23:42.872
Only those who attend the collectivity, raise higher.

23:43.647 --> 23:47.376
For some time maybe you’ll get some benefits,

23:47.528 --> 23:50.536
like you get some money, or fame or something.

23:50.847 --> 23:54.887
Especially in Sahja Yoga some people have this ambitions –‚

23:55.047 --> 23:57.792
that ’how many people can I control’.

23:58.465 --> 24:02.790
Even that also happens, but your personality does not improve.

24:03.492 --> 24:05.413
There is no depth in you and

24:05.977 --> 24:10.397
you are not a Sahaja Yogi of high caliber.

24:10.876 --> 24:16.023
Until you are not of high caliber, all your talks are of no use.

24:16.457 --> 24:19.412
Because, who knows when you will fall from the brink

24:19.508 --> 24:22.676
and who knows when you will be destroyed completely?

24:22.999 --> 24:25.002
That is why we should be cautious

24:25.240 --> 24:29.676
and try to achieve high spiritual personality.

24:31.100 --> 24:33.700
There is one more thing you should do.

24:34.045 --> 24:36.703
If you have got your Realization today,

24:36.973 --> 24:38.659
then ’tomorrow’ you give Realization to thousands of people.

24:39.170 --> 24:41.079
Then your Powers will increase.

24:41.297 --> 24:45.486
If not, whatever little you have achieved, will also be finished.

24:46.689 --> 24:50.689
This is a very peculier rule.

24:51.451 --> 24:55.006
It cannot be compared with anything else.

24:55.278 --> 24:59.615
Like, if one lam enlightened and from that another is enlightened;

25:00.000 --> 25:02.858
even then you cannot say that the

25:03.953 --> 25:06.635
light of the first lamp increases –can not say.

25:06.927 --> 25:11.634
But in Sahaja Yoga I have seen, that if anyone opens his heart

25:11.955 --> 25:16.288
and sincerely does Sahaja Yoga

25:16.360 --> 25:19.663
and not only that but gives Realization to others, he shines.

25:20.259 --> 25:23.425
Because you have been made a Sahaja Yogi

25:23.656 --> 25:26.703
so that you tranform the entire world.

25:27.484 --> 25:33.055
That you create a great wave of transformation in the world

25:33.634 --> 25:37.840
and make it a beautiful place.

25:38.385 --> 25:43.876
The world should become a new and special world

25:44.678 --> 25:48.606
this should be one of your pure desires.

25:49.403 --> 25:53.438
Once you have this pure desire, your Kundalini becomes activated.

25:53.807 --> 25:56.529
I have seen that even very simple, normal people,

25:56.839 --> 25:59.883
when they narrate their experiences, I am surprised-

26:00.050 --> 26:02.644
how did such a thing happen to them?

26:03.660 --> 26:05.994
How did they give such a suggestion?

26:06.887 --> 26:11.767
In Sahaja Yoga also there are some people, who come for power.

26:12.697 --> 26:14.887
Some come for money.

26:15.877 --> 26:20.040
With all these things, the personality of a person is not developed.

26:20.333 --> 26:22.730
There is no glow in their personality.

26:23.015 --> 26:26.914
Because, the light that you have received;

26:27.374 --> 26:30.095
till the time you do not  share it with others;

26:30.453 --> 26:34.984
and within yourself also if you will not be enlightened,

26:35.289 --> 26:38.400
till then no effort will have any success.

26:39.364 --> 26:43.172
Which is to say that our only work is to change the world;

26:43.268 --> 26:44.878
to transform the world.

26:45.053 --> 26:49.021
We have to build a special world and you are special people.

26:49.644 --> 26:54.080
When you begin to understand how important you are,

26:54.334 --> 26:59.319
then with that understanding, you will make your life beautiful.

27:02.804 --> 27:04.793
Have spoken in English,

27:04.994 --> 27:07.934
and spoken in Hindi.

27:08.135 --> 27:11.756
There are so many Maharashtrian’s here

27:11.957 --> 27:14.764
that I should speak in Marathi too.

27:14.965 --> 27:16.731
But it is My wish

27:16.890 --> 27:21.187
that all the Sahaja Yogis who live in Maharashtra

27:21.388 --> 27:23.832
should at least learn the Hindi language,

27:24.033 --> 27:26.399
as it is our National language.

27:26.600 --> 27:33.263
We should love and be ready, if required be ready

27:33.464 --> 27:35.846
to sacrifice anything for our Nation.

27:36.047 --> 27:37.565
People were always ready to do that.

27:37.766 --> 27:39.682
This was the speciality of Maharashtra.

27:39.883 --> 27:42.455
Now the Maharashtra state, which I see,

27:42.673 --> 27:46.262
I don’t understand, where those people have gone.

27:46.463 --> 27:49.849
They took to the Gods and started doing their puja.

27:50.050 --> 27:55.993
After this was done and didn’t work out, they used another way;

27:56.194 --> 27:58.723
they have started going to this guru, that guru,

27:58.924 --> 28:02.683
then going to temples and all that.

28:02.884 --> 28:06.337
We should see what these people have achieved by doing this

28:06.538 --> 28:09.809
what was their benefit,

28:10.010 --> 28:13.127
and what you have achieved by doing Sahaja Yoga.

28:13.328 --> 28:15.357
So now just leave and forget everything

28:15.540 --> 28:19.951
and dedicate sincerely to yourselves

28:20.152 --> 28:24.605
and make your Kundalini to be in perfect state

28:24.806 --> 28:28.400
and through that you can do a tremendous work.

28:28.601 --> 28:34.692
Now, If I say, I am by birth Maharashtrian,

28:34.893 --> 28:38.778
it is very sad for Me to see

28:39.322 --> 28:41.792
that the Sahaja Yoga has spread in north India,

28:41.993 --> 28:46.154
though I have hardly made any effort there,

28:46.355 --> 28:50.428
but it has spread like fire in north India,

28:50.793 --> 28:54.872
which is very surprising.

28:56.273 --> 28:59.029
Why it has not worked out in Maharashtra?

28:59.230 --> 29:03.023
Sahaja Yoga has spread in all big and small villages of Maharashtra.

29:03.230 --> 29:08.932
One day a man had come to work at My place.

29:09.664 --> 29:12.231
He bowed down to Me and did namaskar

29:12.438 --> 29:14.133
so I asked him, “What happened?”

29:14.334 --> 29:19.119
He told Me: „Mataji Your photo is in every big and small villages,

29:19.320 --> 29:22.935
Your disciples are there in all our villages”.

29:23.136 --> 29:25.641
„How can that be?” - I asked.

29:25.842 --> 29:29.741
All of them say: "we are Sahaja Yogis, don’t tell us anything else".

29:29.942 --> 29:33.426
I was wondering how this happened and with whose blessings?

29:33.583 --> 29:38.079
As I was thinking nothing would work in this country,

29:38.280 --> 29:41.202
as too many people are superficial.

29:41.403 --> 29:43.863
But people of Maharashtra are very deep-rooted,

29:44.064 --> 29:46.878
the knowledge they have about everything is  deep-rooted,

29:47.079 --> 29:49.864
but, I don’t know where it has gone.

29:50.065 --> 29:51.458
I have always said

29:51.659 --> 29:55.447
that Sahaja Yogis should come in the collective minimum of minimum,

29:55.648 --> 29:59.679
and maximum of maximum give Realization to thousands of people.

29:59.880 --> 30:01.515
Every day we should only think

30:01.716 --> 30:04.549
how many people did we give Realization to,

30:04.750 --> 30:07.092
how many people

30:09.806 --> 30:12.362
did we awaken the Kundalini to.

30:12.563 --> 30:17.322
You have a job to save the entire world,

30:17.523 --> 30:21.211
as the Kundalini of the world is established in Maharashtra,

30:21.412 --> 30:23.409
and we have eight Ganeshas in Maharashtra,

30:23.610 --> 30:27.575
and three and a half Goddesses are manifested here.

30:27.776 --> 30:30.860
All the arrangements are done here,

30:31.061 --> 30:34.624
but, surprisingly, people do not take interest in that.

30:34.825 --> 30:37.169
People are so false, pretending to be what they are not,

30:37.370 --> 30:43.448
and waste time doing  mundane things.

30:44.403 --> 30:48.666
Instead of doing this, try to achieve the truth.

30:48.867 --> 30:50.819
Pay attention to the truth.

30:51.020 --> 30:54.449
Under any mythical ideea, if you try to do something good

30:54.650 --> 30:56.660
what are you going to achieve?

30:56.861 --> 30:58.808
If you don't change from within,

30:59.009 --> 31:01.642
you cannot achieve anything.

31:01.843 --> 31:08.606
The innate growth should be so deep and mature,

31:08.807 --> 31:13.341
that its fragrance should spread all over the world.

31:13.542 --> 31:17.893
Insted of that we get involved in petty things

31:18.094 --> 31:20.192
and fight among ourselves.

31:20.393 --> 31:22.019
This all should stop.

31:22.220 --> 31:25.718
Instead of that, I see

31:25.909 --> 31:29.556
that Yuva Shakti activities are very good.

31:29.757 --> 31:37.108
Due to yuvashakti the whole of Maharashtra will change.

31:37.309 --> 31:41.566
People who are highly placed,

31:42.360 --> 31:46.317
who are sitting in high positions,

31:46.518 --> 31:49.980
are very arrogant, terribly arrogant.

31:50.181 --> 31:53.637
It is very surprising from where they have got this arrogance.

31:53.838 --> 31:59.400
I fail to understand the reason for this arrogance.

31:59.601 --> 32:01.783
Because of this arrogance,

32:01.984 --> 32:07.658
we were not able to do any special Sahaja Yoga work in Maharashtra.

32:07.859 --> 32:13.055
So, it should be your aim to spread Sahaja Yoga

32:13.256 --> 32:16.911
and to establish people in Sahaja Yoga.

32:17.153 --> 32:20.685
Today is a very special day, the day of Shivratri.

32:20.886 --> 32:23.695
We should all take a pledge,

32:23.896 --> 32:27.248
and pledge to Shri Shiva to get His blessings.

32:27.449 --> 32:30.389
Due to His bliss in your heart,

32:30.590 --> 32:34.626
you will be surprised

32:34.827 --> 32:38.664
there will be flow of joy and flow of love.

32:38.865 --> 32:43.451
First of all, you get ready for that.

32:44.733 --> 32:47.335
You have light in our heart.

32:47.536 --> 32:50.449
This light if we do not spread,

32:50.650 --> 32:54.802
then we will be in darkness, along with others.

32:55.028 --> 32:57.385
So, we should all decide

32:57.586 --> 33:05.321
that we will give Realization to at least 100 people till next year.

33:05.522 --> 33:08.377
I know that if we go and speak to people about Sahaja Yoga,

33:08.578 --> 33:11.209
they won't agree, that is the issue.

33:11.410 --> 33:14.569
They think are over smart but don't have any common sense.

33:14.770 --> 33:17.810
But still if you explain them

33:18.011 --> 33:21.454
what you have gained and what you have benefitted,

33:21.667 --> 33:24.939
what you achieved and what you are still to achieve,

33:25.140 --> 33:28.420
then people may start believing you.

33:28.694 --> 33:30.318
They will trust that

33:30.519 --> 33:35.708
and they will gradually stop their wrong doings.

33:35.909 --> 33:37.801
This is our main responsibility.

33:38.002 --> 33:44.700
For this, you all have to think properly and should act accordingly.

33:44.901 --> 33:46.324
If this does not happen

33:46.525 --> 33:49.540
then I am not sure in what condition will be Maharashtra.

33:49.741 --> 33:53.645
Shivaji Maharaj has worked so hard for this state.

33:53.846 --> 33:58.476
There have been many saints in Maharashtra, unlike anywhere else,

33:58.677 --> 34:01.751
who have shed their blood

34:01.926 --> 34:04.701
for this great and holy land!

34:04.923 --> 34:06.848
That is why it is called Maharashtra.

34:07.023 --> 34:10.742
You should not fight for petty things,

34:10.943 --> 34:13.069
you should not live like petty people.

34:13.270 --> 34:17.184
There is no point, because you people are Realized souls now.

34:17.385 --> 34:20.859
Earlier, there were no Realized souls, but they were land soldiers.

34:21.060 --> 34:22.997
I fail to understand this,

34:23.198 --> 34:27.310
where these people have gone, the people from the royal community.

34:27.511 --> 34:29.478
People who never used to touch alcohol,

34:29.693 --> 34:32.760
are now drinking senselessly.

34:32.961 --> 34:36.185
Under this nonsense they are destroying themselves

34:36.376 --> 34:39.408
and are going away from Shiva.

34:40.873 --> 34:47.447
That is why people have said that God has taken lots of effort.

34:48.649 --> 34:50.474
Everything is done,

34:50.675 --> 34:55.044
but if you are facing the wrong direction then how it will work?

34:55.245 --> 34:58.288
Now you should explain it to people,

34:59.513 --> 35:01.692
from all your heart,

35:01.893 --> 35:07.650
and this is what I am telling you, in this Shiva puja.

35:07.851 --> 35:10.165
If Shiva gets angry,

35:10.396 --> 35:13.848
then He will be angry on Maharashtra first,

35:14.049 --> 35:16.836
as this is a special place for Him.

35:17.037 --> 35:20.845
You know how much people believe in Shiva,

35:21.046 --> 35:24.617
and you know whom Shri Shiva is worshiping first.

35:24.840 --> 35:27.653
For everybody in Maharashtra the first worshipped deity

35:27.854 --> 35:29.182
is Shri Ganesha.

35:29.383 --> 35:32.916
And if He gets disturbed then I am not sure what will happen.

35:33.117 --> 35:37.703
I don’t know when all this iniquity started in Maharashtra,

35:37.904 --> 35:45.317
and I am seeing what people are doing with Shri Ganesha’s idol.

35:45.518 --> 35:47.577
He is Shri Ganesha -

35:47.760 --> 35:51.991
if you insult Him, if you disrespect Him,

35:52.192 --> 35:55.919
then what will happen to you and who will save you?.

35:56.741 --> 36:02.266
So, you need to tell the people that they should get Realization

36:02.530 --> 36:04.573
and they should join Sahaja Yoga,

36:04.764 --> 36:07.072
and get their Kundalini awakened.

36:07.273 --> 36:09.159
Everybody is aware of it,

36:09.360 --> 36:11.614
right from Marchrindra Nath to Gorakh Nath,

36:11.805 --> 36:13.832
everyone has worked on it.

36:14.033 --> 36:16.086
Everyone has knowledge about it,

36:16.285 --> 36:19.330
and everybody knows that Kundalini has to be awakened.

36:19.531 --> 36:22.310
And in Marathi there are books about Kundalini,

36:22.511 --> 36:26.339
but the knowledge of books has remained within the books.

36:26.540 --> 36:29.813
But you should clearly explain about it to people:

36:30.014 --> 36:34.961
„Look, this is the time for you to get your resurection”.

36:35.162 --> 36:38.780
You should get ready for it.

36:38.981 --> 36:43.027
On this auspicious occasion of Shivratri,

36:43.228 --> 36:46.347
we should all decide

36:46.548 --> 36:51.443
that we will spread Sahaja Yoga in tremendous way.

36:51.644 --> 36:56.589
That is of utmost importance and nothing is beyond it in our life.

36:56.790 --> 36:59.884
All your work will be taken care of,

37:00.075 --> 37:02.406
if you practice Sahaja Yoga.

37:02.607 --> 37:03.787
You should meditate.

37:03.988 --> 37:08.006
If you don't meditate what is the point in being in Sahaja Yoga?

37:08.207 --> 37:12.761
Just coming here, singing and all and then going away,

37:12.962 --> 37:15.483
what is the meaning of it?

37:16.684 --> 37:21.234
The main thing is you should feel the Self within,

37:21.435 --> 37:23.424
the transformation in your personality.

37:23.625 --> 37:27.858
That will make you feel so happy

37:28.033 --> 37:31.010
and so proud of yourself.

37:31.211 --> 37:33.924
You will feel: „What we could do now?

37:34.155 --> 37:38.010
It is a very huge task, which should be done by you.

37:38.211 --> 37:43.200
On this auspicious occasion I am telling you,

37:43.401 --> 37:45.913
if you want to please Shri Shiva,

37:46.114 --> 37:49.273
you give Realization to a lot of people.

37:49.448 --> 37:52.463
It means Kundalini is His Shakti.

37:52.664 --> 37:55.487
So you should awaken their Kundalini,

37:55.688 --> 37:59.370
instead of wasting time unnecessarily on unimportant things.

37:59.571 --> 38:02.493
So have your attention on Kundalini awakening.

38:02.694 --> 38:05.382
By doing this, you will change the Maharashtra completely.

38:05.583 --> 38:10.076
There are few people who are creating problems,

38:10.258 --> 38:12.051
but they will get destroyed.

38:12.252 --> 38:14.550
First of all, you should give realization to others,

38:14.751 --> 38:20.562
it is important to give it to as many people as possible.

38:20.763 --> 38:22.838
This is your duty.

38:23.039 --> 38:25.834
Now, this is Shri Shiva puja,

38:26.035 --> 38:27.790
so during his Puja,

38:27.991 --> 38:31.509
establish Shri Shiva in your heart,

38:31.710 --> 38:34.644
so that you will never have problems.

38:34.845 --> 38:37.317
You have to keep Shri Shiva in your heart,

38:37.518 --> 38:40.343
so that when the kundalini is awakened,

38:40.544 --> 38:43.460
you become one with Him.

38:43.661 --> 38:48.931
This transformation takes place because of the light of Shri Shiva,

38:49.146 --> 38:50.911
as He is the Spirit.

38:51.120 --> 38:54.858
He is the reflection of Atma in our heart.

38:55.059 --> 38:59.136
So, in this state of reflection,

38:59.339 --> 39:01.964
you look in your heart, asking yourself:

39:02.165 --> 39:05.859
"Why are you lying and making a fool of yourself?".

39:06.060 --> 39:08.873
introspect youeself from within,

39:09.074 --> 39:13.584
I have tried explaining this to people - they just don’t understand.

39:13.785 --> 39:18.013
They say: "Mother, we heard this lecture today, other another day".

39:18.214 --> 39:20.322
Listening my lectures won’t help you.

39:20.523 --> 39:22.954
If you want to help yourself,

39:23.155 --> 39:27.409
you will have to establish in Sahaja Yoga with full dedication.

39:27.610 --> 39:32.551
This is My request to you all, a request with all My love.

39:32.752 --> 39:36.053
May God bless you all.
