00:00:01.846 --> 00:00:04.545
First, I’ll speak in English language,

00:00:04.746 --> 00:00:10.333
because we have so many people from foreign countries,

00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:12.865
and especially from Madras (Chennai)

00:00:13.048 --> 00:00:18.161
and also from Kerala,

00:00:18.362 --> 00:00:22.050
Hyderabad and Bangalore.

00:00:22.931 --> 00:00:25.801
All these people have come here,

00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:28.846
and I don’t know what other people are here,

00:00:29.211 --> 00:00:34.707
who have come from South

00:00:34.908 --> 00:00:42.048
and who do not yet understand Hindi language.

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:56.654
This Shivaratri has a special meaning, I think,

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.755
because

00:01:04.061 --> 00:01:11.242
there is so much –

00:01:11.443 --> 00:01:16.656
if you read any newspaper in the morning,

00:01:16.857 --> 00:01:23.123
such horrible news is there

00:01:23.385 --> 00:01:28.969
about the people who are trying to create

00:01:29.334 --> 00:01:36.765
all kinds of violence, corruption

00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:41.609
and immoral behaviour.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:49.688
You are surprised how, these
days, it is so full of

00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:55.250
all these criminalities going round us.

00:01:56.528 --> 00:02:03.321
This is the time, as if come, for

00:02:03.346 --> 00:02:08.820
the “Taandav nrutya” (cosmic dance) of Shri Shiva.

00:02:09.956 --> 00:02:15.083
Otherwise, one feels things cannot improve.

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:20.022
It is His anger, if it starts,

00:02:20.848 --> 00:02:26.080
throwing wrath on people of this character and this type.

00:02:27.366 --> 00:02:34.216
I don’t know how anyone can save from His wrath.

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:38.940
He’s a God who is full of love,

00:02:40.067 --> 00:02:44.299
full of tremendous compassion,

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:57.852
but also the- another extreme of very destroying character.

00:02:59.024 --> 00:03:01.026
He can destroy the whole world.

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:09.544
He can finish all the creatures that have been created

00:03:11.092 --> 00:03:14.420
if He gets into a temper.

00:03:20.311 --> 00:03:22.495
You all must be knowing the story,

00:03:23.058 --> 00:03:27.888
how He went into ecstasy.

00:03:29.866 --> 00:03:35.806
There was a devil who had taken a form of a child.

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:38.974
And a mother cannot kill the child,

00:03:40.537 --> 00:03:43.406
she cannot. And She thought

00:03:43.863 --> 00:03:51.699
She won’t be able to save the world from the wrath

00:03:53.267 --> 00:03:56.524
or anger of Shiva

00:03:57.445 --> 00:04:02.050
if He sees the whole world destroyed by this devil.

00:04:08.712 --> 00:04:14.013
So She withdrew from Her act

00:04:15.148 --> 00:04:21.332
of sacrificing the child or killing the child

00:04:22.754 --> 00:04:26.231
and it was Shiva who took over.

00:04:27.716 --> 00:04:33.869
And He just stood on the back of the child and killed him.

00:04:34.535 --> 00:04:36.234
That child was a devil.

00:04:37.537 --> 00:04:41.244
And so, He saved the world

00:04:42.428 --> 00:04:46.117
from the destruction of this horrible rakshasa.

00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:50.365
And then He danced with joy.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.263
That’s what they call as a cosmic, cosmic joy.

00:04:58.017 --> 00:05:00.231
Many people don’t understand why

00:05:00.652 --> 00:05:02.923
He’s standing on top of a little child,

00:05:03.923 --> 00:05:05.503
but the reason was this.

00:05:06.352 --> 00:05:10.378
So, even people may camouflage today

00:05:11.251 --> 00:05:16.536
as small children, as very innocent people,

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:24.832
as very holy gurus,

00:05:26.525 --> 00:05:28.890
Shiva can destroy all of them.

00:05:30.986 --> 00:05:33.695
This destruction has already started

00:05:35.076 --> 00:05:38.576
and is going with a full speed, I think, all over,

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:42.491
through so many things that are happening:

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.564
we have got hurricanes,

00:05:50.723 --> 00:05:53.993
storms, earthquakes,

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.019
many accidents,

00:05:58.186 --> 00:06:01.765
and so many destructive things are working out

00:06:02.463 --> 00:06:06.561
which are the outcome of Kalaki [Kalki] incarnation.

00:06:07.847 --> 00:06:09.632
But, at the same time,

00:06:10.601 --> 00:06:14.801
there is another work going on, of the same incarnation:

00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:18.714
is the resurrection of the people.

00:06:19.762 --> 00:06:22.462
Such people can never be hurt,

00:06:23.375 --> 00:06:25.851
nothing can happen to them.

00:06:26.716 --> 00:06:28.470
They’ll be always saved.

00:06:29.272 --> 00:06:31.425
Everything will be saved for them

00:06:32.036 --> 00:06:37.396
because they are under the protection of their Mother.

00:06:40.224 --> 00:06:44.078
Now the problem is

00:06:44.554 --> 00:06:50.610
how can we the Sahaja Yogis deal with such people

00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:56.626
and to see that they go out of the circulation of evolution?

00:06:59.507 --> 00:07:02.716
Only solution is raising the Kundalini.

00:07:04.556 --> 00:07:07.815
If you raise the Kundalini of human beings,

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.386
who are even very bad and gone cases,

00:07:13.982 --> 00:07:19.519
either they will be destroyed or they will be saved

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:22.132
and they’ll become good people.

00:07:23.465 --> 00:07:26.301
They will stop all this

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.496
horrible things they are thinking and planning in their heads

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.948
and they’ll become really very, very good people.

00:07:39.986 --> 00:07:43.004
It may fail in some cases – I wouldn’t say

00:07:43.205 --> 00:07:47.101
that Sahaja Yoga would be successful in every case.

00:07:48.037 --> 00:07:50.580
But if Sahaja Yogis meditate

00:07:51.159 --> 00:07:55.199
and keep themselves in complete peace

00:07:55.953 --> 00:08:00.947
and also completely surrendered,

00:08:01.915 --> 00:08:03.963
nothing can happen to them.

00:08:05.767 --> 00:08:09.544
They are always protected and you all have an experience

00:08:09.892 --> 00:08:10.965
of that protection.

00:08:12.338 --> 00:08:15.753
But first you should have faith in yourself

00:08:16.547 --> 00:08:19.943
and complete surrendering to Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:21.388 --> 00:08:24.247
We are so many Sahaja Yogis sitting here,

00:08:25.565 --> 00:08:29.620
mostly from North, South, East and West of India,

00:08:30.065 --> 00:08:32.265
and also from other foreign countries.

00:08:33.583 --> 00:08:38.111
Every country is, today, under the,

00:08:39.817 --> 00:08:43.087
we should say, under the control of these negative forces.

00:08:44.198 --> 00:08:48.982
What we have to do is to make people positive

00:08:49.665 --> 00:08:51.443
through Kundalini awakening.

00:08:51.951 --> 00:08:53.665
This you all can do.

00:08:54.416 --> 00:08:55.659
This you can achieve.

00:08:56.357 --> 00:09:00.715
For this, you don’t have to do something special.

00:09:01.461 --> 00:09:06.407
In day-to-day life, you can achieve it and you should do it.

00:09:06.772 --> 00:09:10.956
This is the only thing that is needed today,

00:09:11.068 --> 00:09:14.780
is to transform people and you all can do it,

00:09:15.391 --> 00:09:22.179
all of you can do it in a very sincere and a good manner.

00:09:23.243 --> 00:09:28.195
You don’t have to get to temper, jump at people,

00:09:28.862 --> 00:09:30.872
get angry with rude people,

00:09:31.245 --> 00:09:34.999
but with peaceful attitude, you should achieve it;

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:43.286
so that this wrathful temperament of Shiva,

00:09:43.461 --> 00:09:46.670
as they say, the third eye of Shiva won’t open.

00:09:47.659 --> 00:09:49.781
That’s something horrible.

00:09:50.773 --> 00:09:53.674
We all can do it in a very constructive manner,

00:09:54.316 --> 00:09:56.666
extremely in a constructive manner.

00:09:57.491 --> 00:10:00.912
So what we should do is to, first of all,

00:10:01.261 --> 00:10:07.643
establish our own Shiva principle, is the principle of joy,

00:10:11.167 --> 00:10:12.913
principle of love

00:10:14.564 --> 00:10:17.388
and principle of Truth, I should say.

00:10:19.396 --> 00:10:22.237
There are big problems, also,

00:10:23.046 --> 00:10:26.041
because people have no idea

00:10:26.898 --> 00:10:34.495
as to Shiva’s global temperament.

00:10:37.892 --> 00:10:42.442
For example, I have heard people
quarrelling and fighting over

00:10:42.847 --> 00:10:46.220
Shiva principle and Vishnu principle.

00:10:48.404 --> 00:10:51.214
Now, Vishnu is there, His power is there

00:10:52.326 --> 00:10:55.789
for you to rise up to this Shiva principle.

00:10:58.273 --> 00:11:03.117
Both are not different, one is supplementary for another.

00:11:04.244 --> 00:11:06.784
But if you go on fighting even on that point,

00:11:07.276 --> 00:11:08.602
I can’t understand.

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:13.041
You cannot please Shiva without Vishnu.

00:11:14.731 --> 00:11:20.590
And if you cannot stick to Shiva’s principle,

00:11:20.987 --> 00:11:24.051
if you have not understood the Vishnu principle –

00:11:26.577 --> 00:11:31.172
Kundalini itself rises through the Sushumna Nadi.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:37.277
She is the principle, She is the “tattwa” of Shiva.

00:11:38.702 --> 00:11:42.777
And She rises through the channel

00:11:43.087 --> 00:11:47.931
that is made by Vishnu out of evolutionary process.

00:11:49.343 --> 00:11:54.195
So how can you do away with one of Them?

00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:58.187
One is the road, another is the destination.

00:11:59.687 --> 00:12:03.205
So I hope you understand how important it is

00:12:03.856 --> 00:12:06.824
that your centers should be corrected,

00:12:07.388 --> 00:12:09.993
your road should be alright,

00:12:10.787 --> 00:12:13.588
that your Sushumna should be cleared,

00:12:13.937 --> 00:12:16.813
because we are “madhyamargis”:

00:12:17.575 --> 00:12:19.670
we have to go by the centre,

00:12:20.733 --> 00:12:24.774
by the central path and we have to have the balance,

00:12:25.401 --> 00:12:28.559
not to go to the left and not to go to the right.

00:12:29.567 --> 00:12:32.338
This balance we must keep

00:12:32.539 --> 00:12:34.645
and go on moving until you reach

00:12:35.145 --> 00:12:39.193
your “talu bhaag” (Brahmarandhra) where sits Sadashiva.

00:12:40.961 --> 00:12:44.838
You can experience it, you can see for yourself.

00:12:45.663 --> 00:12:49.105
Whatever I am saying, you know it very well.

00:12:49.566 --> 00:12:53.899
Only thing is when I am telling you, you can verify.

00:12:55.439 --> 00:12:58.719
Sahaja Yoga can be verified very easily,

00:12:59.517 --> 00:13:05.308
and you know that, that you now know the only truth.

00:13:07.078 --> 00:13:10.840
The truth which is absolute.

00:13:11.872 --> 00:13:17.183
This is also the principle which starts showing results

00:13:17.564 --> 00:13:21.333
when these two powers meet.

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:27.788
It is very surprising that, when these two powers meet,

00:13:28.653 --> 00:13:33.812
or when you reach Shiva principle through the Vishnu principle,

00:13:34.351 --> 00:13:35.981
then you realize

00:13:38.489 --> 00:13:44.232
that these two powers are so complimentary

00:13:45.176 --> 00:13:52.115
and so much related to each other.

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:56.591
There’s no difference, in a way,

00:13:57.663 --> 00:13:59.387
between these two powers.

00:13:59.959 --> 00:14:06.141
And, so, keep your road “madhyamarga” [central channel] clean

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:09.350
and let the Kundalini pass through it.

00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:13.374
When the Kundalini will pass through it,

00:14:14.159 --> 00:14:20.876
you’ll be amazed that the same Kundalini

00:14:21.077 --> 00:14:23.384
is going through the Vishnu path

00:14:23.585 --> 00:14:28.741
and reaching at the lotus feet of Shiva.

00:14:33.712 --> 00:14:40.505
All of you recognise Shivji, and He is worshiped.

00:14:41.925 --> 00:14:45.933
But, you do not know the different aspects of His qualities.

00:14:46.551 --> 00:14:49.942
That is why, many times you make mistakes.

00:14:51.978 --> 00:14:56.223
The most important form of  Shivji is bliss and joy.

00:14:57.357 --> 00:15:03.214
And this joy is spread everywhere in subtle and subtlest forms.

00:15:03.532 --> 00:15:09.468
But, until you become spiritually subtle to absorb this,

00:15:09.755 --> 00:15:13.929
you will neither be able to see this nor understand this.

00:15:14.453 --> 00:15:16.649
He resides in everything,

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:22.121
He resides in everything

00:15:26.449 --> 00:15:31.664
and in a way we can say He creates a joyful realm.

00:15:31.865 --> 00:15:36.992
And when you look around in that realm, you find

00:15:37.193 --> 00:15:40.217
that you have been transformed into something else.

00:15:40.464 --> 00:15:44.582
Other people find happiness in different things.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:51.558
Many people find happiness in destroying themselves.

00:15:52.728 --> 00:15:56.696
By taking to different wrong paths,

00:15:57.351 --> 00:16:03.223
people think that if we go against the Spirit, we can find happiness.

00:16:04.448 --> 00:16:10.361
But, the Atma [Spirit], Which is verily Shivji,

00:16:12.752 --> 00:16:15.776
finds joy in a different way.

00:16:17.047 --> 00:16:20.983
And only that can touch our heart.

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:28.222
Like, there are a lot of people who are immersed in material things.

00:16:28.947 --> 00:16:33.581
Some take to alchohol,  some indulge into sinful activities,

00:16:33.852 --> 00:16:36.091
they keep doing all wrong things

00:16:36.432 --> 00:16:39.717
and they think that there is a lot of happiness in that.

00:16:40.211 --> 00:16:41.446
But it is not so.

00:16:41.978 --> 00:16:46.398
gradually they get destroyed and slowly, they are finished.

00:16:47.968 --> 00:16:52.750
But, Shivji is the one who comforts us,

00:16:53.147 --> 00:16:57.322
He gives us peace and He gives us joy.

00:16:58.967 --> 00:17:05.983
And when the Power of Shiva and the Power of Vishnu,

00:17:06.472 --> 00:17:10.246
– like Kundalini and Sushumna Nadi;

00:17:11.056 --> 00:17:17.143
when unite with each other, you get the absolute Truth.

00:17:17.959 --> 00:17:20.349
absolute Truth.

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:26.706
Such that you cannot, in any way,

00:17:26.907 --> 00:17:29.072
refuse to accept this Truth.

00:17:29.273 --> 00:17:31.528
Because it is the absolute Truth.

00:17:32.198 --> 00:17:35.769
Which you can feel on your fingertips, on your hands.

00:17:37.548 --> 00:17:40.190
You will have many types of experiences,

00:17:40.624 --> 00:17:45.552
by which you will understand that in the absolute Truth

00:17:47.055 --> 00:17:50.377
there is not even an iota of untruth.

00:17:50.578 --> 00:17:58.337
That is known within you; you can know it, understand it.

00:17:58.981 --> 00:18:02.322
This is the gift given by the Kundalini.

00:18:03.445 --> 00:18:07.198
This means that the Kundalini, which is the Shakti [Power] of Shiva,

00:18:07.418 --> 00:18:12.512
when She rises through the central channel,

00:18:13.141 --> 00:18:17.954
She awakens all the chakras, aligns them in its entirety,

00:18:18.155 --> 00:18:20.355
and integrates them

00:18:20.556 --> 00:18:24.914
Who looks after that Shakti [Power]?

00:18:25.748 --> 00:18:28.597
We can say that Shri Vishnu looks after Her,

00:18:29.329 --> 00:18:32.200
because She moves in the central path of Vishnu.

00:18:32.522 --> 00:18:35.093
And then She reaches the Brahmarandhra,

00:18:36.966 --> 00:18:38.712
and appears there.

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:43.027
And on reaching there we can understand that

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:47.508
Her journey is now complete.

00:18:48.365 --> 00:18:52.506
So we can see so much cooperation and understanding among them.

00:18:53.923 --> 00:18:55.536
But, we people are there,

00:18:56.823 --> 00:19:01.228
now a type of disease has come that everyone is running after money.

00:19:01.938 --> 00:19:05.493
Running after money has become a very peculier disease.

00:19:05.934 --> 00:19:08.576
And for that we are willing to do anything,

00:19:08.926 --> 00:19:10.822
We take support from anything,

00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:13.229
Even in Sahaja Yoga people do that.

00:19:13.531 --> 00:19:18.014
The reason for this is that some sort of defect has crept into us.

00:19:19.501 --> 00:19:22.858
A lot of negativities have accumulated in us.

00:19:23.743 --> 00:19:28.109
And these negativities can be cleansed only by Kundalini.

00:19:28.916 --> 00:19:36.972
But, until you do not become one with the Kundalini,

00:19:37.173 --> 00:19:40.961
and through meditation if you do not develop It,

00:19:42.255 --> 00:19:45.874
then you cannot reach that state where,

00:19:46.748 --> 00:19:50.207
the Power is manifested in you,

00:19:50.685 --> 00:19:55.771
the Power which is the truth, it is joy giving, peace giving -

00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:58.890
– a weakness remains in it.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:02.838
When the Kundalini rises, She cleanses everything.

00:20:04.155 --> 00:20:07.226
With the Power of Shivji, everything gets cleansed.

00:20:07.738 --> 00:20:11.525
But, still some people because of their old habits

00:20:11.859 --> 00:20:14.726
or because of wrong ideals, suffer a lot.

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:21.678
And those people – with whatever that is wrong,

00:20:22.748 --> 00:20:25.946
whatever bad habits of theirs,

00:20:27.363 --> 00:20:32.632
even with the slightest temptation they fall from their ascent.

00:20:34.371 --> 00:20:38.893
Even if an atom of negativity is left within us,

00:20:39.266 --> 00:20:42.107
remaining within,

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:46.788
We can fall due to that, and get completely destroyed

00:20:47.873 --> 00:20:52.215
Those who come to the Pujas and meditate,

00:20:52.519 --> 00:20:55.334
those people always make progress.

00:20:56.426 --> 00:21:03.719
If there is no peace, even a tree cannot survive, it cannot grow.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.680
Even germination cannot take place.

00:21:06.881 --> 00:21:10.554
That is why, within you,

00:21:10.755 --> 00:21:15.430
if you don't have this meditative quality, don't have these ideals,

00:21:15.631 --> 00:21:18.263
that we will never go towards downfall,

00:21:18.464 --> 00:21:21.946
we will not succumb to any bad habits,

00:21:22.147 --> 00:21:27.072
then you should attend all the pujas – as many as possible

00:21:27.273 --> 00:21:29.996
and you should be in meditation.

00:21:30.197 --> 00:21:33.453
Because now you have the right to do puja.

00:21:33.654 --> 00:21:35.606
Everyone doesn’t have the right to do Pujas.

00:21:35.734 --> 00:21:37.603
Anyone and everyone goes to do puja.

00:21:37.826 --> 00:21:40.444
But when there is no connection,

00:21:40.659 --> 00:21:43.559
then how can you be authorised to do a puja?

00:21:44.153 --> 00:21:45.978
But many people think-

00:21:46.146 --> 00:21:49.876
go to this temple or that temple; go to this guru or that guru.

00:21:50.066 --> 00:21:51.202
Nothing comes out of that.

00:21:51.378 --> 00:21:53.108
You are your own guru,

00:21:53.299 --> 00:21:57.068
and only you can introspect and think, ’what is the problem in me’?

00:21:57.396 --> 00:22:03.848
’In our heart are we completely accepting Sahaja Yoga or not'?

00:22:04.827 --> 00:22:07.659
I have seen a lot of people come into Sahaja Yoga

00:22:07.816 --> 00:22:12.363
and after reaching a certain height, they fall.

00:22:12.962 --> 00:22:16.025
The higher they rise, the lower they fall.

00:22:16.691 --> 00:22:20.826
The reason is that the hidden tendencies in you,

00:22:21.175 --> 00:22:25.937
have somehow become active, without you being aware of it.

00:22:27.506 --> 00:22:29.743
That is why you must pay attention

00:22:30.053 --> 00:22:33.990
– ’hope I am not falling into wrong things’,

00:22:34.764 --> 00:22:41.336
or ’hope, I am not doing anything wrong which is against Sahaja?

00:22:42.133 --> 00:22:47.691
or ’have some bad motives arisen in me that

00:22:48.048 --> 00:22:52.046
I have come to Sahaja with the idea of making money?’

00:22:52.247 --> 00:22:55.588
Or ,’I have come into Sahaja Yoga to do something bad?’

00:22:55.987 --> 00:22:59.112
Our attention should be towards these things.

00:22:59.313 --> 00:23:02.789
The best thing is that, whatever activities of Sahaja are there –

00:23:02.956 --> 00:23:07.877
or however it is possible in Sahaja, like meditation, worship, etc.

00:23:08.078 --> 00:23:12.246
you should do all that and establish individually

00:23:12.447 --> 00:23:16.960
within you, a special type of state

00:23:19.354 --> 00:23:23.084
which we call as

00:23:23.719 --> 00:23:26.666
individuality or as totality.

00:23:26.867 --> 00:23:28.224
Once you are established individually,

00:23:28.425 --> 00:23:30.949
then you can become a collective person.

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:32.761
Those who do not attend collectivity,

00:23:33.149 --> 00:23:36.769
they cannot also grow individually.

00:23:37.176 --> 00:23:38.602
This I have seen.

00:23:38.856 --> 00:23:42.872
Only those who attend the collectivity, raise higher.

00:23:43.647 --> 00:23:47.376
For some time maybe you’ll get some benefits,

00:23:47.528 --> 00:23:50.536
like you get some money, or fame or something.

00:23:50.847 --> 00:23:54.887
Especially in Sahja Yoga some people have this ambitions –‚

00:23:55.047 --> 00:23:57.792
that ’how many people can I control’.

00:23:58.465 --> 00:24:02.790
Even that also happens, but your personality does not improve.

00:24:03.492 --> 00:24:05.413
There is no depth in you and

00:24:05.977 --> 00:24:10.397
you are not a Sahaja Yogi of high caliber.

00:24:10.876 --> 00:24:16.023
Until you are not of high caliber, all your talks are of no use.

00:24:16.457 --> 00:24:19.412
Because, who knows when you will fall from the brink

00:24:19.508 --> 00:24:22.676
and who knows when you will be destroyed completely?

00:24:22.999 --> 00:24:25.002
That is why we should be cautious

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:29.676
and try to achieve high spiritual personality.

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.700
There is one more thing you should do.

00:24:34.045 --> 00:24:36.703
If you have got your Realization today,

00:24:36.973 --> 00:24:38.659
then ’tomorrow’ you give Realization to thousands of people.

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:41.079
Then your Powers will increase.

00:24:41.297 --> 00:24:45.486
If not, whatever little you have achieved, will also be finished.

00:24:46.689 --> 00:24:50.689
This is a very peculier rule.

00:24:51.451 --> 00:24:55.006
It cannot be compared with anything else.

00:24:55.278 --> 00:24:59.615
Like, if one lam enlightened and from that another is enlightened;

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.858
even then you cannot say that the

00:25:03.953 --> 00:25:06.635
light of the first lamp increases –can not say.

00:25:06.927 --> 00:25:11.634
But in Sahaja Yoga I have seen, that if anyone opens his heart

00:25:11.955 --> 00:25:16.288
and sincerely does Sahaja Yoga

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:19.663
and not only that but gives Realization to others, he shines.

00:25:20.259 --> 00:25:23.425
Because you have been made a Sahaja Yogi

00:25:23.656 --> 00:25:26.703
so that you tranform the entire world.

00:25:27.484 --> 00:25:33.055
That you create a great wave of transformation in the world

00:25:33.634 --> 00:25:37.840
and make it a beautiful place.

00:25:38.385 --> 00:25:43.876
The world should become a new and special world

00:25:44.678 --> 00:25:48.606
this should be one of your pure desires.

00:25:49.403 --> 00:25:53.438
Once you have this pure desire, your Kundalini becomes activated.

00:25:53.807 --> 00:25:56.529
I have seen that even very simple, normal people,

00:25:56.839 --> 00:25:59.883
when they narrate their experiences, I am surprised-

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:02.644
how did such a thing happen to them?

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:05.994
How did they give such a suggestion?

00:26:06.887 --> 00:26:11.767
In Sahaja Yoga also there are some people, who come for power.

00:26:12.697 --> 00:26:14.887
Some come for money.

00:26:15.877 --> 00:26:20.040
With all these things, the personality of a person is not developed.

00:26:20.333 --> 00:26:22.730
There is no glow in their personality.

00:26:23.015 --> 00:26:26.914
Because, the light that you have received;

00:26:27.374 --> 00:26:30.095
till the time you do not  share it with others;

00:26:30.453 --> 00:26:34.984
and within yourself also if you will not be enlightened,

00:26:35.289 --> 00:26:38.400
till then no effort will have any success.

00:26:39.364 --> 00:26:43.172
Which is to say that our only work is to change the world;

00:26:43.268 --> 00:26:44.878
to transform the world.

00:26:45.053 --> 00:26:49.021
We have to build a special world and you are special people.

00:26:49.644 --> 00:26:54.080
When you begin to understand how important you are,

00:26:54.334 --> 00:26:59.319
then with that understanding, you will make your life beautiful.

00:27:02.804 --> 00:27:04.793
Have spoken in English,

00:27:04.994 --> 00:27:07.934
and spoken in Hindi.

00:27:08.135 --> 00:27:11.756
There are so many Maharashtrian’s here

00:27:11.957 --> 00:27:14.764
that I should speak in Marathi too.

00:27:14.965 --> 00:27:16.731
But it is My wish

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:21.187
that all the Sahaja Yogis who live in Maharashtra

00:27:21.388 --> 00:27:23.832
should at least learn the Hindi language,

00:27:24.033 --> 00:27:26.399
as it is our National language.

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:33.263
We should love and be ready, if required be ready

00:27:33.464 --> 00:27:35.846
to sacrifice anything for our Nation.

00:27:36.047 --> 00:27:37.565
People were always ready to do that.

00:27:37.766 --> 00:27:39.682
This was the speciality of Maharashtra.

00:27:39.883 --> 00:27:42.455
Now the Maharashtra state, which I see,

00:27:42.673 --> 00:27:46.262
I don’t understand, where those people have gone.

00:27:46.463 --> 00:27:49.849
They took to the Gods and started doing their puja.

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:55.993
After this was done and didn’t work out, they used another way;

00:27:56.194 --> 00:27:58.723
they have started going to this guru, that guru,

00:27:58.924 --> 00:28:02.683
then going to temples and all that.

00:28:02.884 --> 00:28:06.337
We should see what these people have achieved by doing this

00:28:06.538 --> 00:28:09.809
what was their benefit,

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:13.127
and what you have achieved by doing Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:13.328 --> 00:28:15.357
So now just leave and forget everything

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:19.951
and dedicate sincerely to yourselves

00:28:20.152 --> 00:28:24.605
and make your Kundalini to be in perfect state

00:28:24.806 --> 00:28:28.400
and through that you can do a tremendous work.

00:28:28.601 --> 00:28:34.692
Now, If I say, I am by birth Maharashtrian,

00:28:34.893 --> 00:28:38.778
it is very sad for Me to see

00:28:39.322 --> 00:28:41.792
that the Sahaja Yoga has spread in north India,

00:28:41.993 --> 00:28:46.154
though I have hardly made any effort there,

00:28:46.355 --> 00:28:50.428
but it has spread like fire in north India,

00:28:50.793 --> 00:28:54.872
which is very surprising.

00:28:56.273 --> 00:28:59.029
Why it has not worked out in Maharashtra?

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:03.023
Sahaja Yoga has spread in all big and small villages of Maharashtra.

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:08.932
One day a man had come to work at My place.

00:29:09.664 --> 00:29:12.231
He bowed down to Me and did namaskar

00:29:12.438 --> 00:29:14.133
so I asked him, “What happened?”

00:29:14.334 --> 00:29:19.119
He told Me: „Mataji Your photo is in every big and small villages,

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:22.935
Your disciples are there in all our villages”.

00:29:23.136 --> 00:29:25.641
„How can that be?” - I asked.

00:29:25.842 --> 00:29:29.741
All of them say: "we are Sahaja Yogis, don’t tell us anything else".

00:29:29.942 --> 00:29:33.426
I was wondering how this happened and with whose blessings?

00:29:33.583 --> 00:29:38.079
As I was thinking nothing would work in this country,

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:41.202
as too many people are superficial.

00:29:41.403 --> 00:29:43.863
But people of Maharashtra are very deep-rooted,

00:29:44.064 --> 00:29:46.878
the knowledge they have about everything is  deep-rooted,

00:29:47.079 --> 00:29:49.864
but, I don’t know where it has gone.

00:29:50.065 --> 00:29:51.458
I have always said

00:29:51.659 --> 00:29:55.447
that Sahaja Yogis should come in the collective minimum of minimum,

00:29:55.648 --> 00:29:59.679
and maximum of maximum give Realization to thousands of people.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.515
Every day we should only think

00:30:01.716 --> 00:30:04.549
how many people did we give Realization to,

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:07.092
how many people

00:30:09.806 --> 00:30:12.362
did we awaken the Kundalini to.

00:30:12.563 --> 00:30:17.322
You have a job to save the entire world,

00:30:17.523 --> 00:30:21.211
as the Kundalini of the world is established in Maharashtra,

00:30:21.412 --> 00:30:23.409
and we have eight Ganeshas in Maharashtra,

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:27.575
and three and a half Goddesses are manifested here.

00:30:27.776 --> 00:30:30.860
All the arrangements are done here,

00:30:31.061 --> 00:30:34.624
but, surprisingly, people do not take interest in that.

00:30:34.825 --> 00:30:37.169
People are so false, pretending to be what they are not,

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:43.448
and waste time doing  mundane things.

00:30:44.403 --> 00:30:48.666
Instead of doing this, try to achieve the truth.

00:30:48.867 --> 00:30:50.819
Pay attention to the truth.

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:54.449
Under any mythical ideea, if you try to do something good

00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:56.660
what are you going to achieve?

00:30:56.861 --> 00:30:58.808
If you don't change from within,

00:30:59.009 --> 00:31:01.642
you cannot achieve anything.

00:31:01.843 --> 00:31:08.606
The innate growth should be so deep and mature,

00:31:08.807 --> 00:31:13.341
that its fragrance should spread all over the world.

00:31:13.542 --> 00:31:17.893
Insted of that we get involved in petty things

00:31:18.094 --> 00:31:20.192
and fight among ourselves.

00:31:20.393 --> 00:31:22.019
This all should stop.

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:25.718
Instead of that, I see

00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:29.556
that Yuva Shakti activities are very good.

00:31:29.757 --> 00:31:37.108
Due to yuvashakti the whole of Maharashtra will change.

00:31:37.309 --> 00:31:41.566
People who are highly placed,

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:46.317
who are sitting in high positions,

00:31:46.518 --> 00:31:49.980
are very arrogant, terribly arrogant.

00:31:50.181 --> 00:31:53.637
It is very surprising from where they have got this arrogance.

00:31:53.838 --> 00:31:59.400
I fail to understand the reason for this arrogance.

00:31:59.601 --> 00:32:01.783
Because of this arrogance,

00:32:01.984 --> 00:32:07.658
we were not able to do any special Sahaja Yoga work in Maharashtra.

00:32:07.859 --> 00:32:13.055
So, it should be your aim to spread Sahaja Yoga

00:32:13.256 --> 00:32:16.911
and to establish people in Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:17.153 --> 00:32:20.685
Today is a very special day, the day of Shivratri.

00:32:20.886 --> 00:32:23.695
We should all take a pledge,

00:32:23.896 --> 00:32:27.248
and pledge to Shri Shiva to get His blessings.

00:32:27.449 --> 00:32:30.389
Due to His bliss in your heart,

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:34.626
you will be surprised

00:32:34.827 --> 00:32:38.664
there will be flow of joy and flow of love.

00:32:38.865 --> 00:32:43.451
First of all, you get ready for that.

00:32:44.733 --> 00:32:47.335
You have light in our heart.

00:32:47.536 --> 00:32:50.449
This light if we do not spread,

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:54.802
then we will be in darkness, along with others.

00:32:55.028 --> 00:32:57.385
So, we should all decide

00:32:57.586 --> 00:33:05.321
that we will give Realization to at least 100 people till next year.

00:33:05.522 --> 00:33:08.377
I know that if we go and speak to people about Sahaja Yoga,

00:33:08.578 --> 00:33:11.209
they won't agree, that is the issue.

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:14.569
They think are over smart but don't have any common sense.

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:17.810
But still if you explain them

00:33:18.011 --> 00:33:21.454
what you have gained and what you have benefitted,

00:33:21.667 --> 00:33:24.939
what you achieved and what you are still to achieve,

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:28.420
then people may start believing you.

00:33:28.694 --> 00:33:30.318
They will trust that

00:33:30.519 --> 00:33:35.708
and they will gradually stop their wrong doings.

00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:37.801
This is our main responsibility.

00:33:38.002 --> 00:33:44.700
For this, you all have to think properly and should act accordingly.

00:33:44.901 --> 00:33:46.324
If this does not happen

00:33:46.525 --> 00:33:49.540
then I am not sure in what condition will be Maharashtra.

00:33:49.741 --> 00:33:53.645
Shivaji Maharaj has worked so hard for this state.

00:33:53.846 --> 00:33:58.476
There have been many saints in Maharashtra, unlike anywhere else,

00:33:58.677 --> 00:34:01.751
who have shed their blood

00:34:01.926 --> 00:34:04.701
for this great and holy land!

00:34:04.923 --> 00:34:06.848
That is why it is called Maharashtra.

00:34:07.023 --> 00:34:10.742
You should not fight for petty things,

00:34:10.943 --> 00:34:13.069
you should not live like petty people.

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:17.184
There is no point, because you people are Realized souls now.

00:34:17.385 --> 00:34:20.859
Earlier, there were no Realized souls, but they were land soldiers.

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:22.997
I fail to understand this,

00:34:23.198 --> 00:34:27.310
where these people have gone, the people from the royal community.

00:34:27.511 --> 00:34:29.478
People who never used to touch alcohol,

00:34:29.693 --> 00:34:32.760
are now drinking senselessly.

00:34:32.961 --> 00:34:36.185
Under this nonsense they are destroying themselves

00:34:36.376 --> 00:34:39.408
and are going away from Shiva.

00:34:40.873 --> 00:34:47.447
That is why people have said that God has taken lots of effort.

00:34:48.649 --> 00:34:50.474
Everything is done,

00:34:50.675 --> 00:34:55.044
but if you are facing the wrong direction then how it will work?

00:34:55.245 --> 00:34:58.288
Now you should explain it to people,

00:34:59.513 --> 00:35:01.692
from all your heart,

00:35:01.893 --> 00:35:07.650
and this is what I am telling you, in this Shiva puja.

00:35:07.851 --> 00:35:10.165
If Shiva gets angry,

00:35:10.396 --> 00:35:13.848
then He will be angry on Maharashtra first,

00:35:14.049 --> 00:35:16.836
as this is a special place for Him.

00:35:17.037 --> 00:35:20.845
You know how much people believe in Shiva,

00:35:21.046 --> 00:35:24.617
and you know whom Shri Shiva is worshiping first.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.653
For everybody in Maharashtra the first worshipped deity

00:35:27.854 --> 00:35:29.182
is Shri Ganesha.

00:35:29.383 --> 00:35:32.916
And if He gets disturbed then I am not sure what will happen.

00:35:33.117 --> 00:35:37.703
I don’t know when all this iniquity started in Maharashtra,

00:35:37.904 --> 00:35:45.317
and I am seeing what people are doing with Shri Ganesha’s idol.

00:35:45.518 --> 00:35:47.577
He is Shri Ganesha -

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.991
if you insult Him, if you disrespect Him,

00:35:52.192 --> 00:35:55.919
then what will happen to you and who will save you?.

00:35:56.741 --> 00:36:02.266
So, you need to tell the people that they should get Realization

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:04.573
and they should join Sahaja Yoga,

00:36:04.764 --> 00:36:07.072
and get their Kundalini awakened.

00:36:07.273 --> 00:36:09.159
Everybody is aware of it,

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.614
right from Marchrindra Nath to Gorakh Nath,

00:36:11.805 --> 00:36:13.832
everyone has worked on it.

00:36:14.033 --> 00:36:16.086
Everyone has knowledge about it,

00:36:16.285 --> 00:36:19.330
and everybody knows that Kundalini has to be awakened.

00:36:19.531 --> 00:36:22.310
And in Marathi there are books about Kundalini,

00:36:22.511 --> 00:36:26.339
but the knowledge of books has remained within the books.

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:29.813
But you should clearly explain about it to people:

00:36:30.014 --> 00:36:34.961
„Look, this is the time for you to get your resurection”.

00:36:35.162 --> 00:36:38.780
You should get ready for it.

00:36:38.981 --> 00:36:43.027
On this auspicious occasion of Shivratri,

00:36:43.228 --> 00:36:46.347
we should all decide

00:36:46.548 --> 00:36:51.443
that we will spread Sahaja Yoga in tremendous way.

00:36:51.644 --> 00:36:56.589
That is of utmost importance and nothing is beyond it in our life.

00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:59.884
All your work will be taken care of,

00:37:00.075 --> 00:37:02.406
if you practice Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:02.607 --> 00:37:03.787
You should meditate.

00:37:03.988 --> 00:37:08.006
If you don't meditate what is the point in being in Sahaja Yoga?

00:37:08.207 --> 00:37:12.761
Just coming here, singing and all and then going away,

00:37:12.962 --> 00:37:15.483
what is the meaning of it?

00:37:16.684 --> 00:37:21.234
The main thing is you should feel the Self within,

00:37:21.435 --> 00:37:23.424
the transformation in your personality.

00:37:23.625 --> 00:37:27.858
That will make you feel so happy

00:37:28.033 --> 00:37:31.010
and so proud of yourself.

00:37:31.211 --> 00:37:33.924
You will feel: „What we could do now?

00:37:34.155 --> 00:37:38.010
It is a very huge task, which should be done by you.

00:37:38.211 --> 00:37:43.200
On this auspicious occasion I am telling you,

00:37:43.401 --> 00:37:45.913
if you want to please Shri Shiva,

00:37:46.114 --> 00:37:49.273
you give Realization to a lot of people.

00:37:49.448 --> 00:37:52.463
It means Kundalini is His Shakti.

00:37:52.664 --> 00:37:55.487
So you should awaken their Kundalini,

00:37:55.688 --> 00:37:59.370
instead of wasting time unnecessarily on unimportant things.

00:37:59.571 --> 00:38:02.493
So have your attention on Kundalini awakening.

00:38:02.694 --> 00:38:05.382
By doing this, you will change the Maharashtra completely.

00:38:05.583 --> 00:38:10.076
There are few people who are creating problems,

00:38:10.258 --> 00:38:12.051
but they will get destroyed.

00:38:12.252 --> 00:38:14.550
First of all, you should give realization to others,

00:38:14.751 --> 00:38:20.562
it is important to give it to as many people as possible.

00:38:20.763 --> 00:38:22.838
This is your duty.

00:38:23.039 --> 00:38:25.834
Now, this is Shri Shiva puja,

00:38:26.035 --> 00:38:27.790
so during his Puja,

00:38:27.991 --> 00:38:31.509
establish Shri Shiva in your heart,

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:34.644
so that you will never have problems.

00:38:34.845 --> 00:38:37.317
You have to keep Shri Shiva in your heart,

00:38:37.518 --> 00:38:40.343
so that when the kundalini is awakened,

00:38:40.544 --> 00:38:43.460
you become one with Him.

00:38:43.661 --> 00:38:48.931
This transformation takes place because of the light of Shri Shiva,

00:38:49.146 --> 00:38:50.911
as He is the Spirit.

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:54.858
He is the reflection of Atma in our heart.

00:38:55.059 --> 00:38:59.136
So, in this state of reflection,

00:38:59.339 --> 00:39:01.964
you look in your heart, asking yourself:

00:39:02.165 --> 00:39:05.859
"Why are you lying and making a fool of yourself?".

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:08.873
introspect youeself from within,

00:39:09.074 --> 00:39:13.584
I have tried explaining this to people - they just don’t understand.

00:39:13.785 --> 00:39:18.013
They say: "Mother, we heard this lecture today, other another day".

00:39:18.214 --> 00:39:20.322
Listening my lectures won’t help you.

00:39:20.523 --> 00:39:22.954
If you want to help yourself,

00:39:23.155 --> 00:39:27.409
you will have to establish in Sahaja Yoga with full dedication.

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:32.551
This is My request to you all, a request with all My love.

00:39:32.752 --> 00:39:36.053
May God bless you all.
