00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.840
Now I get many letters saying, ‘Mataji, let the love flow from our hearts.’

00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:13.695
Now how am I supposed to do that?

00:00:13.776 --> 00:00:20.624
First open your hearts. I will tell you how to open your hearts

00:00:20.784 --> 00:00:27.912
How to open your hearts starts with a small thing.

00:00:27.993 --> 00:00:34.762
Make a list of the people whom you love and whom you hate.

00:00:34.843 --> 00:00:44.190
Then write a loving letter to the ones whom you hate…

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.079
Very difficult thing! Extremely difficult!

00:00:51.413 --> 00:00:58.198
Write to them saying, ‘ I remember you a lot as you are great.’

00:00:58.279 --> 00:01:03.682
It is ok even if they are not, nothing wrong in saying so!

00:01:04.185 --> 00:01:12.798
Then say,’ I will feel very nice if you send an answer to this letter.’ Try it out

00:01:12.898 --> 00:01:18.518
It will work out because the Spirit has made you capable of that love

00:01:18.605 --> 00:01:21.524
There should be no superficiality. He should not feel that ,

00:01:21.604 --> 00:01:25.262
’Oh, today he has sent a good letter
so tomorrow’s is going to be horrible.

00:01:25.343 --> 00:01:29.127
This first letter is an introduction to what will follow! '

00:01:30.708 --> 00:01:36.102
So, you should send a heartfelt letter full of love

00:01:36.183 --> 00:01:41.789
Send to those people whom you hate or feel bad about.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:48.004
But start with Sahaja yogis. Firstly, they should be Sahaja yogis

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.619
But you will be surprised that
when you write for the first time,

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.616
there will be at least one line
expressing that anger of the past.

00:02:01.305 --> 00:02:05.620
So write one more, then a third and after a hundred letters,

00:02:05.708 --> 00:02:11.355
there will be at least one letter where this anger is not at all expressed.

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.392
We should open our hearts to the person with whom we are angry.

00:02:16.473 --> 00:02:19.588
We should see, what he did, am I also doing?

00:02:19.675 --> 00:02:22.968
If you have done, then what is the need to be angry?

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:29.188
If he has behaved like that then I won’t behave in the same way.

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.203
In reality, you must love him.
