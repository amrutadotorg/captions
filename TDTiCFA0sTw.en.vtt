00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.340
The gentleman who accompanies, his name is
Mr.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:13.710
Chatterjee but I have never seen anyone so
far, playing those talas [rhythms] on tabla

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.730
so well.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.600
It’s alright to play all North Indian talas
on tabla, but to mix up both and to manage

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.300
the South Indian talas on tabla is the first
time I am seeing.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.869
Otherwise they normally use mrudungum.

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:41.920
It is a very, very unique combination of things
we have worked out and, if you have time,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.300
do come some time to our centre and we’ll
explain to you what is the naada [sound] and

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:56.960
what does it mean and what is this great instrument
which is called as veena, which is the Primordial

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.460
Instrument.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:06.000
All the instruments are variations and manifestations
of this instrument, which is the first, the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.460
primordial, conceived first, in the awareness
of human beings and that’s why it is regarded

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.890
as a holy instrument.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:28.520
It is in the hand of the Goddess Saraswati,
who is the Goddess of Learning and of Lalitakala,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.119
meaning the five arts.

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:47.359
According to the great seers, the Goddess
of Learning suggests or symbolises a personality

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:54.920
which must know music; means if a person,
if he is learned, then he must know what is

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.920
music.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.100
If he doesn’t understand music, then he’s
not yet a perfect, learned man.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.740
Everybody who is a learned man, must know
music.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.420
That is indicated by this instrument in the
hands of Saraswati.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.910
And there are two other things She has: one
hand has got books in the hands, that she

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:23.280
should really know the real Scriptures, or
the person who is a learned man must know

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.780
real Scriptures, the truths about the real
Scriptures.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.660
They should be able to discriminate which
is real and which is unreal.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:38.640
Then another is, in the hand, is a rosary,
means a person who is learned must be a detached

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.640
person.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:47.830
If you do not play veena with a detached mind
the spontaneity gets controlled by your conditioning.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.180
That’s why it is important that a person
should be a Realised soul and, when you are

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:01.790
a Realised soul, the spontaneity flows absolutely
unhindered, unobstructed by your conditionings,

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.850
by your biased temperaments, by your misidentifications.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.010
And that is why, after Self-realisation only,
I find, that Mr.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.840
Rayat has suddenly started manifesting it
so beautifully and the whole thing is blossoming

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.840
so good.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.510
I’m sorry that people from London could
not come over here to listen to him because

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.260
we have specially arranged this program in
such a manner that it makes [it] interesting

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.490
and understandable for all of you.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.540
Doesn’t matter, next time, again, we are
going to try this.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:44.400
But I am really very happy to see him working
out the inner being within you – the inner

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.700
force of Kundalini, the force of your residual
consciousness which gives you Realisation

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:56.710
– beautifully on veena, which is a very,
very rare thing; seldom people can do it,

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.410
and I could see that and I congratulate him.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:09.870
And may God give him more and more of this
art so that he puts spirituality into an awakening

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.900
state into many people who are seeking it.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.159
May God bless you all!
