00:04.600 --> 00:06.340
The gentleman who accompanies, his name is
Mr.

00:06.340 --> 00:13.710
Chatterjee but I have never seen anyone so
far, playing those talas [rhythms] on tabla

00:13.710 --> 00:14.730
so well.

00:14.730 --> 00:21.600
It’s alright to play all North Indian talas
on tabla, but to mix up both and to manage

00:21.600 --> 00:27.300
the South Indian talas on tabla is the first
time I am seeing.

00:27.300 --> 00:30.869
Otherwise they normally use mrudungum.

00:30.869 --> 00:41.920
It is a very, very unique combination of things
we have worked out and, if you have time,

00:41.920 --> 00:48.300
do come some time to our centre and we’ll
explain to you what is the naada [sound] and

00:48.300 --> 00:56.960
what does it mean and what is this great instrument
which is called as veena, which is the Primordial

00:56.960 --> 00:58.460
Instrument.

00:58.460 --> 01:06.000
All the instruments are variations and manifestations
of this instrument, which is the first, the

01:06.000 --> 01:14.460
primordial, conceived first, in the awareness
of human beings and that’s why it is regarded

01:14.460 --> 01:19.890
as a holy instrument.

01:19.890 --> 01:28.520
It is in the hand of the Goddess Saraswati,
who is the Goddess of Learning and of Lalitakala,

01:28.520 --> 01:34.119
meaning the five arts.

01:34.119 --> 01:47.359
According to the great seers, the Goddess
of Learning suggests or symbolises a personality

01:47.359 --> 01:54.920
which must know music; means if a person,
if he is learned, then he must know what is

01:54.920 --> 01:55.920
music.

01:55.920 --> 02:01.100
If he doesn’t understand music, then he’s
not yet a perfect, learned man.

02:01.100 --> 02:05.740
Everybody who is a learned man, must know
music.

02:05.740 --> 02:10.420
That is indicated by this instrument in the
hands of Saraswati.

02:10.420 --> 02:15.910
And there are two other things She has: one
hand has got books in the hands, that she

02:15.910 --> 02:23.280
should really know the real Scriptures, or
the person who is a learned man must know

02:23.280 --> 02:27.780
real Scriptures, the truths about the real
Scriptures.

02:27.780 --> 02:31.660
They should be able to discriminate which
is real and which is unreal.

02:31.660 --> 02:38.640
Then another is, in the hand, is a rosary,
means a person who is learned must be a detached

02:38.640 --> 02:39.640
person.

02:39.640 --> 02:47.830
If you do not play veena with a detached mind
the spontaneity gets controlled by your conditioning.

02:47.830 --> 02:53.180
That’s why it is important that a person
should be a Realised soul and, when you are

02:53.180 --> 03:01.790
a Realised soul, the spontaneity flows absolutely
unhindered, unobstructed by your conditionings,

03:01.790 --> 03:06.850
by your biased temperaments, by your misidentifications.

03:06.850 --> 03:11.010
And that is why, after Self-realisation only,
I find, that Mr.

03:11.010 --> 03:15.840
Rayat has suddenly started manifesting it
so beautifully and the whole thing is blossoming

03:15.840 --> 03:16.840
so good.

03:16.840 --> 03:23.510
I’m sorry that people from London could
not come over here to listen to him because

03:23.510 --> 03:29.260
we have specially arranged this program in
such a manner that it makes [it] interesting

03:29.260 --> 03:31.490
and understandable for all of you.

03:31.490 --> 03:34.540
Doesn’t matter, next time, again, we are
going to try this.

03:34.540 --> 03:44.400
But I am really very happy to see him working
out the inner being within you – the inner

03:44.400 --> 03:49.700
force of Kundalini, the force of your residual
consciousness which gives you Realisation

03:49.700 --> 03:56.710
– beautifully on veena, which is a very,
very rare thing; seldom people can do it,

03:56.710 --> 03:59.410
and I could see that and I congratulate him.

03:59.410 --> 04:09.870
And may God give him more and more of this
art so that he puts spirituality into an awakening

04:09.870 --> 04:13.900
state into many people who are seeking it.

04:13.900 --> 04:14.159
May God bless you all!
