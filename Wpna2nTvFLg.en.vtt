00:00:04.873 --> 00:00:13.653
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:15.813
First of all

00:00:15.873 --> 00:00:18.953
We have to know what is the truth.

00:00:19.173 --> 00:00:23.113
People are seeking, seeking, seeking, seeking all over.

00:00:23.373 --> 00:00:34.653
But they don't know what they are seeking and what should they get after their seeking.

00:00:35.613 --> 00:00:50.653
This seeking can lead you into many diverse directions. Some of them could be very very dangerous and absolutely misleading.

00:00:50.653 --> 00:00:59.013
And many must have or also felt that. I'm sure there are many who have found it out.

00:00:59.313 --> 00:01:07.653
But they think there is no way they can return.

00:01:07.893 --> 00:01:11.753
The seeking is very simple to understand.

00:01:12.013 --> 00:01:14.453
That you want to know yourself.

00:01:15.813 --> 00:01:20.233
All the time we say : i want this, i like this, i this, i that.

00:01:21.613 --> 00:01:26.353
But who is this I? What is it?

00:01:26.693 --> 00:01:28.413
Who is this one myself?

00:01:28.693 --> 00:01:34.353
What am i? Do i know anything about myself?

00:01:34.653 --> 00:01:39.333
It's very superficial knowledge we have about ourselves.

00:01:39.553 --> 00:01:44.713
Everybody have said, all the religions have said : you should  know yourself.

00:01:44.913 --> 00:01:51.393
There is no difference on this one. Actually in all religions, if you're go into essence, there is no difference.

00:01:51.613 --> 00:01:59.333
According to time it was little bit stressed on one point and sometimes on another point.

00:01:59.593 --> 00:02:06.873
But the fundamental thing is that you have to know yourself.

00:02:07.153 --> 00:02:10.393
How do you know yourself is the point.

00:02:11.178 --> 00:02:16.203
People will say: do this, give up everything, give up your family,  give up everything.

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:21.839
Wear, this kind of dress cut your hair or shave your head and all that nonsense.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.020
It's so outward.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.400
If you put a little bit of your intelligence you'll see it's all outward.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.720
It's so skin deep, it has no meaning.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.700
So what has to happen?

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.440
We talk of a last breakthrough of the evolution.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.900
How do you achieve it?

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.400
When you are evolved up to the stage of human beings.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.180
We have to know one thing for definitely.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.160
That there's something missing within us.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.880
Otherwise world would have been a most beautiful place, the paradise to live in.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.420
But something's wrong with the human beings and what is that?

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.480
Is to understand how we have come through evolution.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:22.640
And as human beings there are so many things of the animal stage lingering within us.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:34.220
The way we talk, the way we try to oppress others, the way we talk to sort of dominate others.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.900
The way we want to snatch everything, the way we are only worried about our food.This, that.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:49.740
All this is not really a noble human beings sides.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.080
These are all lingering from that animal instinct. All right. We have to accept it.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.760
Because we are human beings so they are to be there.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.840
Nothing so much frightening.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.600
But also we have one more thing that we think.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.460
And we think and think and think and think no end of ourselves sometimes.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.119
Sometimes we think we should protest for this.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.620
Sometimes we feel that we must become very violent

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.280
All these things are coming from our human mind.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:34.280
Animals won't be violent for something just for violence sake. They'll be violent, alright.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.640
But for their own purpose of killing some animal or something.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.300
But here we have groups and groups of people who just enjoy violence.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:53.720
This is another development in the human awareness, i think, that we enjoy  destruction of others.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.780
But also there is a seeking.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:05.880
This is the sign that people want their evolution, they want to evolve into a better personality.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.880
That they want to become

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.659
something

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.550
which is complete.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.540
How do you achieve it?

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:22.500
Now I must say that we have not achieved our evolution ourselves up to the human level.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.560
So to achieve a higher

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.919
awareness

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.549
there must be some arrangement between us.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.549
And that is the arrangement we are not aware of.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.829
And that arrangement is that within you is the power.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.860
It's your own power.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.710
To give you this

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:47.319
last breakthrough

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.549
Through the awakening of that power, already you have been told about it.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.620
It exists,  it's there.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:04.440
And It is the right of every human being to get his self-knowledge, self-realization.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.520
Sahaja,  Saha means born with you.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.440
With you is born the right.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.100
And why should we not ask our fundamental  rights

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:21.440
society that we should have our self-realization. Which is your own.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:29.460
It is there already placed within you. You don't have to do anything, of course you can't pay for it.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.560
How much did you pay for your evolution so far?

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.610
And how can it be different from different people?

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:42.969
Because in every human being this power, which we call as Kundalini exists.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.820
Whether he is white, black, yellow, blue any color.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.480
Whether he belongs to north or south, anyplace.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.840
Whether he belongs to this country or that country.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:03.520
They all have this power universally placed it their Kundalini.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.940
Even if I say everybody has a heart.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.300
So why should we have differentiation?

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.600
But this mind.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:19.360
This human mind creates this differentiation and this problems saying that of course they are not of our country.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:25.510
They don't belong to our group and like animals again we start getting into groups.

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.210
Groups of

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.610
different, I don't know, denomination. Like some people have their

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:38.860
fork and spoon put this way, so they are one group.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:45.699
Some people drink coffee, so they have a group like that, you see. We are very good at forming groups.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:52.390
This is also animal instinct, I think, that we try to form groups of such stupid things.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.210
And then we can have wars.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:01.840
Because we must fight. We are a group,something great, so we should fight others.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.969
All these instincts that are within us are inherited.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.929
They have come to us. They say it is in our genes.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.580
Still, can we change the genes?

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.420
Can we

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.820
transform

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.830
Our personality into something higher and for that

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:29.360
I tell you there is a power within us all of you have that power within you.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.080
And what does it give you?

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:38.460
It  passes through six centers, as  told you, it nourishes it

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.640
it integrates it and

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:48.260
ultimately it pierces through the last fontanel bone area. We can call that actualisation or the baptism.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.120
And is

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.200
connected to the all-pervading power of divine love.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.550
Again, I say love

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.170
divine compassion.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.170
And divine love.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.400
So you get connected to that power which is all-pervading?

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:15.530
If you ask a doctor who runs our heart, he'll say it's the autonomous nervous system.But what, who is the auto?

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.660
Who does all these things?

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.020
Who does all the living work?Look at this flowers,beautiful.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.480
Who has made these flowers such a different different flower?

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:31.500
How does this mother Earth differentiates and how she gives all these flowers?

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.040
Do we think about it? We take it for granted.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:40.820
All living work we take it for granted, but it is done by this divine power.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.300
Believe me. There is this divine power

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.400
around us which protects us, which looks after us, which guides us

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.020
and also

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.429
above all it loves us.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.460
And it cares for us.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.520
It wants, that we should all receive

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.720
the blessings of this all-pervading power.
