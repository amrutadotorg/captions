00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:14.440
You have not entered into any competition. Just to relax.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.680
Just relax.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.880
Then the more you want to do about Sahaja Yoga,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.440
again you are tensed. "I have to meditate early in the morning;

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.280
I have to get up tomorrow early in the morning".

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.520
You see, you go on torturing yourself.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.200
The whole night you won't sleep,

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.240
and when you are meditating you are dosing.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.040
Relax, God is looking after you, believe me.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.160
He is going to give you Realization and He is going to look after you.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.520
He is going to wake you up in the morning too, but relax.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.800
The first idea that "I can do it" is wrong.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.320
He has to do it.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.800
It's not working out because you think you can do it.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.200
If you can come to this conclusion that "I cannot do it,

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.080
it is His mercy, His graciousness that has to work out."

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:37.560
But after Realization you have to do something

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.080
in the sense you have to desire.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.880
But when I say you have to desire it, again you will say,

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.160
"All right. Now I'm going to sit down here and nail myself to this place

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.720
and I'm going to sit down and desire."

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.440
This desire is a dead desire you see

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.320
it is just pushed onto your head that "Oh, I must desire. Mother has told I must desire.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.680
You have to be hungry.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.880
You don't say that "I have to desire that I have to be hungry".

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.720
Do you?

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:26.840
The hunger is from within which is there, no doubt, but it's clouded.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:37.880
The hunger is clouded because you have fear.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.600
If you put a goat before a tiger

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:51.160
and give him to eat he will reduce with that eating whatever it is.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.440
Because it has that fear,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.080
that there is a tiger which is going to eat you.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.760
So first kill all the imaginary tigers around you.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.120
Again you come back to the same.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:15.280
That desire must come from within and it is said, but it is clouded.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.640
Relax!

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.880
It should not be that "I'm very relaxed."

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.920
It's childlike; it's simple.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.600
A relaxed person is just like a child.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:54.720
So not to get frightened, try to relax.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.360
That's all, for everyone.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.520
But relaxation never means that you are inactive.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.680
On the contrary, the person who is relaxed is extremely active

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.440
on the exterior. But inside he is absolutely silent,

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.720
absolutely relaxed and at ease.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.000
Outside you may feel,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.520
as you know, now at this time tremendous vibrations are flowing.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.160
And I can see the flow tremendous,

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.360
and all the chakras are doing like this around Me.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.880
But I see them in their place.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:57.640
At the most I may stop talking, but it is flowing.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:14.600
So whether it is for the seeking or for anything else in the world,

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.920
the first thing is

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:23.600
that you must take an attitude of a relaxed witness.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.680
If you can do that,

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.800
then those who are not feeling vibrations will definitely feel.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.240
I see people on whom I've been working,

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.400
and it wouldn't work out.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.880
Of course they were not rude or in any way arrogant

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.000
but they felt very sad that they couldn't feel vibrations,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.640
so I said, "All right, today you'll go and

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.360
enjoy the flowers in the garden.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.280
Enjoy the birds and talk to the sky and come back tomorrow .

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:08.560
It works out. Because you have been always like this.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.920
In Sahaja Yoga you don't have to achieve anything.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.880
You become.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.080
First you become

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.880
and then mentally you understand Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.720
But those who try to understand Sahaja Yoga mentally first

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.800
are really in for trouble.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.520
Because when you read this, sounds so great

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.240
and you think, "Oh God, where am I?"

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:58.440
So please, if you give Realization to someone, take it easy.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.920
It will grow.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.600
Don't give The advent to read the next moment.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.520
We do it!

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.720
Why we think we should impress a person,

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.160
that Sahaja Yoga is a great thing and the person must see that well

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.120
so he'll come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:23.360
and will establish this man because he will see and he'll be impressed.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.800
If somebody is going to be impressed by these things,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.240
such a person is of no use for Sahaja Yoga, take it from Me.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:39.160
If they are going to be impressed by something exterior and superficial,

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.000
how far will they?

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.600
They have to achieve it within themselves, their own Spirit.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:59.520
They have to be impressed by themselves, by their maturity.
