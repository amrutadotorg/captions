00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.892
1984-0313 Public Program Day 2, Constitution Club of India, New Delhi (India) CAM 1 DP-RAW, The Construction Of Our Being Within Ourselves.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:32.892
I bow to all the seekers of the truth.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:44.892
Yesterday, I told you, in short, what is Sahaja Yoga?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:03:00.892
Sahaja, saha means with and ja means born, Yoga means union with the divine, in simple words.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.892
Saha is with, ja is born, is born with you, something that is born with you,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.892
is the right to achieve the union with the Divine.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.892
This is Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:34.892
How it happens? Why it happens? Is to be seen.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:45.892
Howsoever, I may try to explain it to you, it may be that you may not believe it,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.892
but as I requested you yesterday, like as a scientist, you have to keep your mind open,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:10.892
with pure scientific attitude, and see for yourself if this hypothesis I put before you, is true or not?

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.892
But if you put a barrier in your mind, like a student going to American college,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.892
has a barrier in his mind about medicine, cannot receive anything, in the same way,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:30.892
if you put a barrier in your head against knowing about the roots,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.892
roots that nourishes this great tree of creation.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.892
You can never understand what I am talking about.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:54.892
Whatever I am telling you today, has been written in our scriptures, in this great land of yoga bhumi,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.892
this country which you have taken for granted as you have taken our human existence for granted,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:10.892
the greatest of greatest country is India, because spirituality, spirit is the highest,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.892
this is the country which is going to deliver goods to all the nations around.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:27.892
In this Yoga Bhumi, whatever I am telling you today, has been discovered at least 16000 years back,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:38.892
people were practicing this, not in a way we are doing it today, in a hall, individually, not amass.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:48.892
But today the time has come to get this knowledge, the knowledge of extreme, [UNCLEAR WORD].

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.892
Everyone, can have the experience of ones own spirit,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:11.892
Also I told you, that in the West, they talk of individuality, as a result of that we think that they have achieved a lot,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.892
but individuality cannot come to human beings unless and until they are mature enough.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.892
So, the maturity has to be first improved, and then the manifestation of the individuality can be sensible.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.892
Otherwise, people will go amuck and that’s exactly what’s going on in the West today,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.892
and we are following them into the same problem.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:42.892
So, now today, as I told you, I’ll be telling you about the conception of our being within ourselves.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:53.892
Yesterday, I told you what mistake Jung made, who was the disciple of Freud, in describing a human being.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:04.892
In describing a human being, he said that human being is made of the unconscious first. He described him in layers.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.892
Like first, the unconscious, then the unconscious that is going to manifest,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:20.892
then the subconscious, and then the conscious mind, and on top of that He said that is the ego.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:35.892
This is typically a western Yogi talking, because he didn’t have the heritage of our wealth,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.892
but you can see here clearly how we are built.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.892
We are not built one on top of another that way, but it’s a parallel thing,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.892
built beautifully by a very great organizer

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:02.892
and the central path of our ascent is kept absolutely clean, and open for us to ascent.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.892
Because any ordinary organizer can also see that if you have to go somewhere

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.892
then you have to keep the passage clean.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:18.892
Then the one who is the organizer of all the organizations, such a person, why will he keep us like this?

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.892
That we have to go through the subconscious to achieve the unconscious,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:31.892
and this is why these Gurus and all these people are telling you that you have to go to the unconscious

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.892
through the subconscious strata, so you have to become like mad people.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.892
Even people say that when Kundalini is awakened, you have to behave like a mad person,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:50.892
you start jumping and doing all kinds of things, actually those who are unauthorized, can create problems

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.892
And this is the reason why so many people in the world are literally frightened to have their ascent.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.892
These books, which are published, I mean, anybody can write about Kundalini, there is no authority to stop it.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.892
There is no law to stop it.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.892
They can write whatever they feel like on their individual basis, and people buy these books and get frightened.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.892
I think this is a very negative approach, because without the ascent of human beings

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.892
to that level of the spirit, you cannot solve the problems of this universe.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.892
You try anything, so far whatever we have tried through our mental projections,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:37.892
has a linear movement, which comes back and recoils upon you, as I told you yesterday, the scientific, the political, the economic.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:47.892
But the only approach that can spread all over comes only when you become the spirit

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.892
and it is important that we all have to become the spirit, especially the Indians,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.892
because we have our heritage, and it is very easy for an Indian to get an ascent .

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.892
but he doesn’t settle down so well, as a westerner can, because for him, its too precious and for us it is not.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.892
Like our independence, I think we do not reach our freedom of our souls.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.892
In the same way, we just do not bother about sustaining ourselves,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:25.892
but I hope that this august gathering can give some heat to their self-emancipation,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.892
and with self-confidence they will achieve it.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:44.892
Now, here we have as you see in the chart, three type of channels,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.892
first, we will be dealing about the nadis.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.892
There are three types of nadis in our body.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:00.892
This, of course, in the medical terminologies can be called as left and right sympathetic nervous systems, and the parasympathetic.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:08.892
But, in Sahaja Yoga science these three channels are the expressions, are gross expressions of the subtle nadis,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:16.892
one is called as Ida on the left side, Pingala in the right side, and Sushumna in the center.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.892
Kabira has said, “Ingala Pingala Sukhamana Nadi.”

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.892
They all have talked in a poetry, nobody have tried to find out what they have been saying,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.892
what he mean by this? There are three nadis that exist within us,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.892
and express themselves in gross as left and right sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.892
Now as far as the medical science is concerned,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.892
the doctors do not know how to control the parasympathetic.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.892
Sympathetic is controllable, if you run fast, the heart beats faster,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.892
but it comes back to its normal through parasympathetic.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:12.892
Now, this central path, of Sushamna, which expresses the parasympathetic nervous system in the gross, is the path of our ascent.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:22.892
Accordingly we have three types of peoples, and permutations and combinations of these three types.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:32.892
The first one of these types which is the left sided, the left sided people are the people who are emotional people.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.892
Because it caters to our emotional side.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.892
With science, you cannot explain emotions, love, attachments.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.892
Science is a very limited field.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.892
With medical science you cannot explain, but with psyche, so called psychological science,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.892
which I think is compared to our knowledge in this country, is not even a little [UNCLEAR WORD] child.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:07.892
Now this psyche, or the left side is also catering to our past.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:18.892
Whatever is built in within us, since our creation, exists in this area, which is called the collective subconscious.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:26.892
The other day in London, I saw one television show by the people who are doing research in cancer, .

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:37.892
and they admitted that the triggering of the cancer takes place from the area which is built within us, built within us, since our creation.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:46.892
And they say there are proteins, they call them as proteins, proteins 58 proteins 53,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:56.892
whatever name you may give, they admit that this kind of area exist within us and from this area,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.892
this area the attack comes for cancer, this much is admitted.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.892
Now for the right hand side, you have another nadi called the pingala nadi, which is very strong in Delhi.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.892
This is the nadi which creates the RajoGunis.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.892
The first one creates the TamoGunis and the second one creates the RajoGunis,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:26.892
which act for our physical and mental activities of the future.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.892
For example, we are planning, morning till evening we are thinking.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.892
Those who are futuristic people indulge into this creation

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:43.892
and they develop an institution on the top of their head like a balloon called Ego.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:55.892
While those who indulge into the left side activities create an institution which is called as Super Ego or all the conditionings within.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.892
Now, these two things definitely exist within us, even according to Jung.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:16.892
When we grow, these two develop into a calcified formation of the fontanelle bone area and we get closed down.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.892
So we develop, an identity, a name, a personality and you separate yourself from others,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.892
that’s how you get your freedom from the whole.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.892
In Sanskrit language, we call animals as Pashu means they are in Pasha,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.892
means they are not free, they are under the pash of God’s realm,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.892
they are not free to decide for themselves what should they do?

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:53.892
But we have a right to decide, we can decide, we have that freedom to decide, whether to go to God,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.892
or to go to Hell, we can say whether to be benevolent or to be cruel.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.892
We have all the freedom to decide whatever we want to do.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:21.892
And this power of decision within us gives us the special position in the whole kingdom of animals,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.892
that we can decide, that we have a power to decide.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:35.892
Now, in this decision making, if we emphasize on individuality, we do not cater or care to our maturity.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.892
If you are not mature enough and you start deciding what you have to do,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.892
then you have no relationship to the Whole and you become a person who is like an abandoned personality.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:57.892
Same thing happens in the cancer, when a cell loses its connection with the whole, it becomes malignant,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.892
it becomes ego-oriented, it starts overpowering others, eating others,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.892
and developing itself with no proportional understanding of the whole

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.892
and this is what is happening today to all the ego-oriented society, where they think they should develop.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.892
The way they have developed, now they don’t know what to do?

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.892
Now this conscious mind, when this develops, I mean, this effort of the ego,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.892
when it develops in such a way, it hampers your consciousness.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:37.892
It doesn’t allow you to use your conscious mind to live well.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:44.892
Like Hitler you become, like Homini you become, you become so ego-oriented,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.892
a barrier is so much created in your mind, that you cannot connect yourself with others,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:57.892
and people say that this is thick-headedness and this thick-headedness is nothing but a man who is very ego-oriented.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.892
According to our Indian Philosophy, a man who is Ahankari is a stupid fellow;

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.892
he ultimately ends up into many stupidities which we cannot explain.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.892
I have seen the countries which are ego-oriented, you just don’t understand why they do these stupid things,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.892
because they are only ego-oriented, they believe in individuality and they have no maturity of any kind.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.892
And they do such so immature things, you are surprised the way they are handling very serious situations.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:42.892
So, this ego develops within us and now I find that all these ego-oriented people are also quite frightened of it, absolutely frightened of it,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:51.892
they think that they are doing harm to others, aggressing others, as they don’t want to do it, but they have no control over it.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:00.892
Now, as I told you, the left side is the person who is emotional, who is very loving, who is very kind,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.892
as I told you that I heard in England, every week two children are killed by parents.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.892
I mean I can’t think of such thing in India.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.892
I mean here, it’s the other way round, they will do anything for their children.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.892
This is going to another extreme of Super Ego, where to you, your child is the most important to you,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:28.892
So you, one has to come in the center and the center is the Sushumna Nadhi, Which is Sattvo Guni as they call it

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.892
Because it is a balance. You have to have a balance.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:42.892
And to create a balance within ourselves, we have got this void, which is, which is our religion.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.892
Now, this religion has nothing to do with the outside religions we are talking about.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.892
But fundamentally, we have got 10 valencies. As carbon has got 4 valencies,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:02.892
human beings have 10 valencies. You know that, all the matter has got only 8 valencies,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.892
while human beings have 10 valencies and these are 10 commandments

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.892
or you can tell the 10 dharmas, that exist within us.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.892
When we try to go out of that dharma and into imbalances,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:25.892
then we develop problems of stomach, of various nature that even doctors cannot make out

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.892
how they develop it and how to work it out.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:35.892
Now this has got 10 chakras built in on your head, here. 5 on this side and 5 on the other side.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.892
This we, in the Sanskrit language we call as Ekadasha Rudra.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.892
They are 11 Rudras because the center one is the, one of the primordial being,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.892
what we call the Virat, is Akbar.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.892
These 11 chakras, when they set in motion, our destruction starts.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.892
They are responsible for destroying us. Because if we do not construct, we go towards destruction.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.892
So these 11 Rudras, are very important and in modern times I find they are extremely active.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.892
God knows, how human beings are going to be destroyed,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.892
whether from within or from without, the fear is everywhere.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.892
But the only solution is, that you become your Spirit.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:31.892
Spirit resides in the heart. And Spirit, is the source of all the joy. The truth.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.892
The truth that is absolute. For example, a person who is spiritually developed,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.892
the one who has got spiritual power, will say the same thing as the other person will say.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.892
There is no duality in it. There’s no fight. So, to develop it,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:56.892
you have to have the ascent of your Kundalini. When the Kundalini rises, then only,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.892
the Spirit can be awakened within you. There’s no other way around.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.892
People say that there can be another way, this can be done, that can be done.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.892
There can be no other way for a seed to be sprouted. You have to put it into Mother Earth,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.892
because She is the only one who has capacity to sprout the seed.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.892
In the same way, your Kundalini which is residing into triangular bone, has to rise.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.892
Now what is this Kundalini? Kundalini is the true desire.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.892
Is the true desire, or what we call the Shudha Icha. Pure desire.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:37.892
All other desires of human beings are impure. As we say in the economics that,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:46.892
the wants are satiable, only partially in the sense that in general they are not satiable.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.892
In general, they are not satiable. That means if you want something,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.892
supposing you want to have a house. When you have a house, you want to have a car.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.892
Want to have car, then you want to have a garden.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:05.892
The desire which you have desired for, doesn’t give you the satisfaction that you asked for.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.892
So you go on asking for more and more. That proves that the desire you had,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.892
or you always had, whatever desires you had, are not true desires.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.892
If they were so, when they were quenched, you should have got the satisfaction.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.892
So the true desire, the power of true desire and the pure desire, is the Kundalini,

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:34.892
the 3 and a half coiled energy within us which resides in the triangular bone.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.892
Now this resides there. It is there, has been described for, thousands of years in our country.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.892
But we are so westernized, that we don’t want to see, what exists within us.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.892
You can see in course of your Sahaja Yoga treatment and all that,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.892
those people who have obstruction in the second or the third centers,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.892
the Kundalini pulsates just like a heart, this triangular bone pulsates just like a heart.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.892
And you can even see the movement of the Kundalini.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.892
Even you can feel on top of your head, the throbbing, LOP DOB, the hearts,

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:18.892
throbbing on your head, as Kabira has said [Hindi : [shunya shikhar par anhad baje] ].

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.892
When it breaks, then you start feeling the cool breeze

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.892
which is called as the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.892
In the Bible, they have described Holy ghost, which is very ambiguous thing, nobody knows about it.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.892
Because they don’t want to anything else but Bible. But, it is the Adi Shakti,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.892
the Adi Kundalini, the one who is the Primordial Kundalini, which is the Holy Ghost,

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.892
which is reflected within you, as your own Kundalini, your own Mother.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.892
And She is the Mother of every individual. Just waiting,

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:03.892
for someone who is authorized by Divinity, to be able to give you your second birth.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.892
But there are many people, who are self-certified second birth,

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.892
they are born-agains and this and that.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.892
But as a result of awakening of the Kundalini, as I told you yesterday, you must become,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.892
again I say, you have to become, collectively conscious.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.892
Means you should feel, on your fingertips, the sympathetic nervous system of others, and your own.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.892
You should feel the difference of your chakras. And you should find out,

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.892
what’s wrong with yourself and what’s wrong with [UNCLEAR others].

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.892
Now the modern Sahaja Yoga has done only one, great thing is that,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.892
that it enlightens thousands of people. Because without enlightenment,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.892
if you tell somebody “don’t do this, this will spoil your balance”. People will do it again.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.892
But, if Kundalini is awakened, then the Dharma gets enlightened within you,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.892
and I don’t have to tell anybody don’t do. You just don’t do it.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.892
It just happens automatically. And that’s why first, let the light come. Maybe it is very faint,

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.892
maybe it is [UNCLEAR slight] there, maybe that, you do not feel much.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.892
But you start feeling the problems that you have.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.892
And because you separate yourself from yourself, and you can witness yourself,

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:25.892
you can very easily, locate your problems and if you know how to cure them,

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.892
you can get cured. You yourselves try to cure.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.892
There are many people, who come and tell me, that Mother my Agnya is catching.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.892
In English ordinary language it means Mother I’m suffering from terrible ego.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.892
But if you have to tell somebody you are suffering from ego, you better run away after them.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.892
But this is what happens to you. You start facing yourself. So clearly, so boldly.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.892
And when you know the knowledge that, this is wrong with me, you’ll just start correcting.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.892
And with others also, you start correcting them. Not telling them what’s wrong with them,

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.892
but talking on their chakras, so they don’t understand, and they can also be cured.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.892
It’s not only the physical cure I’m talking about. Of course physical is the minimum that can happen to you.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.892
Let’s see only one point how we can cure cancer with Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:23.892
Now as I told you there are subtle centers within us, which look after, cater our plexuses.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.892
Now say one of the plexuses, is made like this.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.892
With the left and the right, sympathetic nervous system, and in the center

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.892
you have the chakras of the center, the subtle center.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.892
Now the left and the right sympathetic is passing through this, creating the center,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.892
and in the center is the Sushumna Nadhi.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.892
If you see the shape of my hand, is also something like your [UNCLEAR vertebral].

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.892
Now what happens, that if the energy is very much [UNCLEAR spent],

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.892
say a person is very ego oriented, he works very hard, he does this he does that,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.892
all kinds of things. Then what happens, that the energy is pulled out of this place very much.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.892
At that time if there is an attack from the left, then, this, pushed out.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.892
And once it is the pushed out, the connection with the whole is lost.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.892
And the cells, start moving on their own.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.892
And once they start moving on their own, they become malignant.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.892
Now how do, we, or Sahaja Yogis can manage to help such a person?

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.892
Is a very simple thing because a Sahaja Yogi is connected to the mains as this one is,

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:43.892
and through him, is the vital energy, which is emotional, which is physical,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.892
which is mental and which is also evolutionary.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.892
Is all combined together, is passing through him. Which is we call as Chaitanya.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.892
When this Chaitanya is given to that point, that, takes up all that is necessary

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.892
and again joins back to the same point and that’s how we cure cancer.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.892
There’s nothing special about it, but when you say that,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.892
I know that this time I had a very though time, with organizations run by doctors.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.892
They got very angry with me and they throw a challenge and all that.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.892
Now to be very frank, I’m in no way want to harm any doctors.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.892
On the contrary as I told you, that this is the science of the roots while they have the science of the tree.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:37.892
Only patients who are gone cases, whom doctors cannot treat, I would like to help.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.892
And the poor people of our country who cannot reach doctors.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.892
These are the only areas I touched, and the rest of the rich people are available to them.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.892
I do not have to, in any way disturb you on that point.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:00.892
Now, this left side, is also very important.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:07.892
Right side is when I told you, you get extremely futuristic.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.892
That is very important in a place like Delhi. That people are extremely futuristic.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.892
They have no time. They have no time for themselves. They have no time for their family,

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.892
they have no time for their children. They are busy. They are busy running the rat race.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.892
Now as a result of that, what happens? There is one Swadistana Chakra,

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:36.892
on the center, which caters, which I do not know if doctors will agree, but it does, caters,

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:46.892
to a very important function. Is to transform the fat of the stomach, for the use of the brain.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.892
Because you know the brain is made of fat cells.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:57.892
Now this function, is one of the most important, for this particular Swadistana Chakra.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.892
which of course in the gross, looks after the Aortic plexus.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.892
Now, when you overuse this center, for only this purpose,

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.892
all the rest of its functions become subsidiary and sometimes become [UNCLEAR].

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.892
Under these circumstances such a person must suffer, either form diabetes,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:30.892
because it caters to liver, to pancreas, to spleen, to kidneys, and to the ovaries,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.892
and some parts of the uterus in the ladies.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.892
Now when a man, starts using too much of this center,

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.892
then he can have anyone of these problems. For example, he could be a liver patient,

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.892
and doctors don’t discover liver trouble, till one gets cirrhosis.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:59.892
He might develop a diabetes; he may develop, a very serious disease called as leukemia

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.892
because of spleen trouble. He may develop intestinal troubles, and also kidney.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.892
So the kidney trouble of high blood pressure and all that.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:18.892
So when you reduce it to its roots, it comes to one side, that the gentleman is suffering from the right side.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.892
If you can cure the right side, you can cure the person of all these diseases.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.892
But if he goes too far, and escapes all these things maybe, he gets a heart attack.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.892
Heart attack, due to over activity. Over activity, one can get a heart attack.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.892
Now the left sided people are mostly people, who do not take sufficient proteins,

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.892
have lethargic organs, lethargic organs by which, you can say,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:57.892
you develop angina on the heart, you can develop, liver can give you all kinds of skin troubles,

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:05.892
like allergies and all that. other problems of lethargic spleen

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.892
and lethargic pancreas can develop if a person doesn’t take sufficient proteins in life

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.892
or if he is too much left side is, emotional, always thinking of the past

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.892
as we Indians are more glorious in the past, and future is all in the dark.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.892
Such people, do develop, a problem on the left side.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.892
Now, if you reduce it to the left side problem, and if you know how to cure the left side,

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.892
and nourish it, we can solve the left side problem as well.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.892
Now the worst problem that comes, is the wrong,

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.892
attachment to wrong type of people who talk of God.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.892
Who indulge into anti-God activities. Those who indulge into anti-God activities

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.892
and become gurus, can give very serious troubles, mostly on the left side,

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.892
and some on the right side. One can get a heart attack, one can get a cancer,

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.892
one can get leukemia. All kinds of left sided problems can come from these gurus

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.892
because they mesmerize you, and in mesmerism, they put some sort of a thing,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.892
the same protein which doctors have described into you,

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.892
by which you might get into trouble. People develop all kinds of nervous troubles

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:30.892
which cannot be cured, and also, they develop a nervous skin, nervous stomach.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.892
All this nervousness comes from that kind of a, unknown attack about

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.892
which we have made no enquiries and found out nothing about.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:48.892
I’m not only dealing here with you about the mental or the emotional things.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.892
I’m not only dealing with people who are having physical problems.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.892
Now we have got, as I, we discussed yesterday, about the Yoga. I told you that,

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:04.892
Ashtanga is 8 fold. It’s not only 1, that you start doing some exercises.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.892
It is not at all that, it’s wee bit of it. And one must know the science of that also,

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.892
that unless and until Kundalini rises, which is describes as Ishwara Pranidhana,

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.892
means establishment of Ishwara within you, unless and until the Kundalini rises,

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.892
any exercise you do is absolutely indiscriminate. For example,

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.892
people who are left sided should not do any exercise forward bending,

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.892
those who are right sided should never do any exercise that is backward bending.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.892
But there is no discrimination in this so called Yoga, that they teach today.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.892
So, anybody who wants, can dabble, into all this sciences, because

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.892
we have not paid any attention to understand that it is so well organized.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.892
The science of God’s power, are so well organized, they are so accurate,

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.892
and so absolute, that there is no change. Like you cannot get theories of Einstein

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.892
flouted by another one. Then theories of somebody flouted by another one.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.892
Einstein of course was realized soul. And he did talk of a Macrocosm and a Microcosm

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.892
which is very close to Sahaj Yoga, that once you get your realization,

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.892
the Microcosm, the cell, becomes the whole.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.892
And that is what exactly happens. To you when you get your self-realization.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:31.892
Now we have got these 6 chakras on top of the, Mooladhar.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.892
Mooladhar is the first chakra, which is a very important Chakra, and is the center of innocence.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.892
I wonder how many people understand the value of innocence.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.892
In the west specially I was shocked.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.892
The way they are playing about with their chastity, they have no sense of chastity left in them.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.892
They don’t know what they are playing [UNCLEAR]. They are playing with fire.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.892
And that’s why now they have developed horrible diseases, incurable diseases.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.892
And I don’t know what kind of a, eruption is going to take from within.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:07.892
Without understanding how we are dying.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.892
Thank you very much.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.892
All these things must be understood, properly. What these sciences are.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.892
If you have any questions, I would like to have, for about 5 minutes.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.892
What these Preta Vidyas, Spashana Vidyas and all these cults are, and these occults are,

00:37:14.000 --> 00:38:36.892
[Hindi]

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.892
and how they harm us. Unless and until we know about it,

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.892
we cannot administer human beings properly.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.892
We will not wonder what pressure they are working in, and how to cure them.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.892
The only solution I find is that we all should receive our self-realization,

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:39.892
which is a collective, consciousness within ourselves.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.892
We become collectively conscious when we become the spirit.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.892
Then we understand others, we understand ourselves.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.892
Now these 6 chakras, I will be telling you tomorrow about, in very clear words

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.892
I’ll explain to you what these chakras are, how they are responsible.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.892
It is very kind of him to arrange that.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.892
I have told you about the Mooladhara today and about the Swadistana.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:28.892
[Yogi]: Her Holiness Mataji Nirmala Devi, [Indian Name] [UNCLEAR] governor of Delhi,

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.892
and my dear brothers and sisters.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.892
Today’s program, is [Hindi].

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.892
The purpose of human life, is evolution from the human to the Divine,

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.892
and experience of the God within you.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.892
The purpose of music, is to sing the praise of the Lord, His attributes,

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.892
and the beauties of His creation.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:04.892
The purpose of dance, is to express devotion through body, mind and soul.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.892
So todays program, of [Hindi], is fully oriented,

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.892
to that Divine purpose for which God created music and dance.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:20.892
Today’s program of [Hindi], is choreographed by [Indian Name], the well-known,

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:27.892
renewed, dedicated and innovative dancer and dance teacher of Delhi.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.892
This program is being dedicated, to Her Holiness Mataji Nirmala Devi,

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.892
who has got the power, to awaken the Divinity within us,

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.892
and experience true devotion to God. True devotion to God cannot be experienced,

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.892
unless, the Kundalini [UNCLEAR is] awakened and, in the lotus of your heart,

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.892
you feel the Divinity within you.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.892
This program of [Hindi] is a thanks offering to our [UNCLEAR] governor,

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.892
our beloved [Indian Name]. who is not only an able, and, administrator.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.892
But also a person with a large heart. A person overflowing with love and compassion.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.892
A person whose life is based upon dedication and service to the people.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:23.892
He functions, from the level of the heart. I remember how, so willingly, so spontaneously,

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.892
he agreed to give us a beautiful, valuable piece of land in south Delhi,

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:34.892
for, our [UNCLEAR]. The only question asked me was whether it is for the cause of Dharma.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:45.892
I told him it is so. I told him our Divine Mother, is doing great work throughout the world,

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.892
and we want to establish a beautiful Ashram.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:55.892
So I often think, if there are 100 administrators like [Indian Name] through the country,

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.892
with his heart and head, the country will be a different place.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.892
Now, in a short while from now, the culture program will start.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.892
Before that, I will request the [Indian Name] to say a few words.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:34.892
[Indian person]: Her Holiness Mataji, Mr. [Indian Name], distinguished guests,

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.892
ladies and gentlemen. It is my privilege to be with you this evening.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:47.892
I am doubly privileged by the fact that, Mataji is here.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.892
we all know, that cities [UNCLEAR are the spiritual work after] the nations.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:01.892
Delhi, has a special role to play in molding the Indian society.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.892
The worth of the city is not to be measured in its building or its boulevards,

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:14.892
or its parks and green vistas, but, by the spirit that it nurtures.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.892
You have had the most illuminating lecture I believe.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.892
And I’m sure, the establishment of the Ashram in this part of the country, that is Delhi,

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.892
will help in making our city, spiritually beautiful.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.892
And form this Ashram, grace will travel all over the country.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.892
As I said the cities are the spiritual [UNCLEAR workshop] of the nation.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:55.892
I would not like to, say anything more in the, such a distinguished gathering,

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.892
and I’m told that there, there are series of lecture and when the Ashram is established then,

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.892
I’m sure Delhi is going to have every many talks about this subject and this will help the cities into Delhi,

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:13.892
in improving their caliber in the spiritual sense. Not in the material sense.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.892
I wish you the best of luck, best of time. Being a very noble cause,

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.892
I will extent all my support and assistance.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.892
Both as individual and as an officer.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:34.892
My distinguished friend Mr. [Indian Name] was referring to the allotment of the land.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.892
But I think he is so persuasive, hardly anybody can refuse him.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:46.892
So I once again and, congratulate you for starting this venture in Delhi. Mr. [Indian Name]

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.892
and all his friends and colleagues. And I’m sure our city is going to have a great landmark,

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.892
spiritual landmark, and I again wish you the best of luck, best of time. Thank you very much.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.892
Shri Mataji: I just wanted to say that tomorrow we are not having any program,

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.892
and day after tomorrow, we are going to have 3 programs, one after another.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.892
And I will again, try the [UNCLEAR Pra Yoga] of, self-realization.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.892
Because today there is a program like this, so we have made it rather short.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:38.892
But, from tomorrow onwards, means day after tomorrow, we start this experiment of Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.892
I hope you’d make it convenient to come again and again. Thank you very much.
