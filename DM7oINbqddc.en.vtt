00:00:27.957 --> 00:00:32.317
Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

00:00:32.362 --> 00:00:37.410
brothers and sisters from Europe

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.060
and our brothers and sisters from the host countries,

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.890
We welcome you to our concert this evening.

00:00:46.931 --> 00:00:49.590
I'll let my colleague, Alex Henshaw

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.530
tell you what we have for your entertainment

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:59.180
and hope that you all enjoy, very
much, what we have to present for you.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.710
Thank you.

00:01:13.642 --> 00:01:16.224
So with a packed programme tonight, we'll start

00:01:16.213 --> 00:01:19.254
with a saxophone raga, Raag Jog

00:01:19.273 --> 00:01:24.144
and this is with Nicholas Buff on the saxophone

00:01:24.155 --> 00:01:26.655
and Sandesh playing tabla.

00:23:44.475 --> 00:23:49.295
We have another raga, this time a synthesiser raga,

00:23:49.313 --> 00:23:51.345
Bhageshwari

00:23:51.345 --> 00:23:54.689
and Dhananjay Dhumal is playing this,

00:23:54.689 --> 00:23:59.344
again accompanied by Sandesh on the tabla.

01:12:06.299 --> 01:12:11.854
So our next item we have a sitar raag.

01:12:11.864 --> 01:12:16.124
This is performed by Avaneendra Sheolika

01:12:16.158 --> 01:12:20.520
and again accompanied by Sandesh on tabla.

01:12:41.485 --> 01:12:44.780
Jai Shri Mataji,

01:12:44.786 --> 01:12:46.980
in today's concert, tonight's concert

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.770
I've decided to play Raag Puriya Kalyan

01:12:52.896 --> 01:13:00.336
I'll play Alaap, Jyot, Jala, the pure description of raga

01:13:00.343 --> 01:13:03.666
followed by free composition

01:13:03.703 --> 01:13:11.093
Vilambit, a slow one. It is set to Teen
Tal, a rhythmic cycle of sixteen beats.

01:13:11.103 --> 01:13:16.403
Followed by Mandela Jhap Taal,
a rhythmic cycle of ten beats.

01:13:16.418 --> 01:13:22.248
Then again a true Teen Tal, a fast
one. It is set to Teen Tal again.

01:13:22.281 --> 01:13:26.888
a rhythmic cycle of sixteen beats.
Raag Puriya Kalyan. Thank you.

02:21:27.250 --> 02:21:31.867
Just now we have heard all these four artists.

02:21:31.867 --> 02:21:36.610
The first one is an Australian.

02:21:38.360 --> 02:21:41.125
I only know his surname, but I don't know his name.

02:21:41.125 --> 02:21:42.765
What is his name?

02:21:42.765 --> 02:21:45.265
Nick Buff

02:21:45.265 --> 02:21:46.265
Nick?

02:21:46.265 --> 02:21:55.092
Right! So his name is Nick and I heard him before also.

02:21:55.110 --> 02:21:58.332
But this instrument that he played

02:21:58.372 --> 02:22:02.392
I've never heard anybody playing
classical Indian Music with that.

02:22:02.504 --> 02:22:05.004
I think it must be very difficult to play

02:22:05.004 --> 02:22:10.287
with that particular saxophone that you have seen,

02:22:10.326 --> 02:22:14.737
but how he is played it because
Indian Music is all melodious,

02:22:14.737 --> 02:22:17.936
and it cannot be played in parts and it's...

02:22:17.946 --> 02:22:20.526
I was amazed how he managed it

02:22:20.594 --> 02:22:26.263
and another thing which has really
enamoured me about him is this,

02:22:26.281 --> 02:22:33.923
that my father had a great desire to spread our Indian Classical Music all over the world.

02:22:33.923 --> 02:22:37.091
And he said if you spread this music

02:22:37.103 --> 02:22:46.161
then all kinds of music, which are
not music but are noises, will vanish.

02:22:46.176 --> 02:22:53.220
And so people should know this classical music, then they can play any other music they want.

02:22:53.220 --> 02:22:56.846
His ambition was like that,

02:22:56.865 --> 02:23:04.406
and I am so happy that Baba Mama
has started a beautiful academy,

02:23:04.436 --> 02:23:09.425
very beautiful land he has got in Nagpur.

02:23:09.422 --> 02:23:15.111
And from that academy, this
gentleman, Mr Nick has come up.

02:23:15.148 --> 02:23:17.958
And in such a short time,

02:23:17.978 --> 02:23:23.669
so remarkable, he is a genius, must be
something special that in such a short time

02:23:23.670 --> 02:23:29.400
to play a raag, like Jog, is very difficult.

02:23:29.415 --> 02:23:32.980
Only great musicians play that I have seen.

02:23:33.010 --> 02:23:35.510
I have heard Vilayat Khan Sahib

02:23:35.510 --> 02:23:40.767
and also I've heard our....

02:23:40.776 --> 02:23:43.907
his nephew as you have known him very well.

02:23:43.940 --> 02:23:51.041
So, all these difficult ragas, I thought
he'd play Yaman or something like that,

02:23:51.051 --> 02:23:54.981
but here he plays Jog and so well:

02:23:55.025 --> 02:23:58.466
like any other great musician.

02:23:58.507 --> 02:24:02.311
So actually my eyes were filled with tears,

02:24:02.356 --> 02:24:07.976
I don't know what to say that I never knew
this academy can produce such good artists

02:24:07.976 --> 02:24:10.476
and such good talent would be utilised.

02:24:10.489 --> 02:24:13.569
It's more creditable because he is not an Indian.

02:24:13.569 --> 02:24:19.289
And in such a short time, he has
picked up this difficult music.

02:24:19.301 --> 02:24:25.600
It's really, absolutely an impossible feat.

02:24:25.620 --> 02:24:30.550
And I have no words actually, to describe My joy,

02:24:30.560 --> 02:24:36.440
that one of the desires My father had, is fulfilled.

02:24:36.441 --> 02:24:42.341
Now once we establish this academy,
many people will go. I am sure to it

02:24:42.341 --> 02:24:47.867
and will learn this. In that, of
course, Guruji has helped a lot,

02:24:47.877 --> 02:24:52.327
Sandesh has helped a lot, Jane
has helped, everybody has helped.,

02:24:52.351 --> 02:24:56.197
but still, I must say is creditable to the talent.

02:24:56.231 --> 02:24:58.327
I never knew Australians were that talented.

02:24:58.327 --> 02:25:01.065
They are! You will see their talent now.

02:25:01.079 --> 02:25:05.595
They are quite talented. I think it
is Shri Ganesha's blessings on them,

02:25:05.582 --> 02:25:07.725
that they're so talented.

02:25:07.725 --> 02:25:14.235
But this playing Indian Music
you see, it's not an easy thing

02:25:14.234 --> 02:25:19.786
And it's remarkable, I don't know,
maybe My father's blessings are working

02:25:19.798 --> 02:25:23.096
or I don't know what's
happening to this academy, that

02:25:23.107 --> 02:25:33.359
such a brilliant and such a beautiful, melodious
rendering of this Jog Raga you have heard.

02:25:33.379 --> 02:25:45.250
I am very grateful to him for really reproducing
something, that is an impossible feat.

02:25:45.270 --> 02:26:03.104
The second person for whom a great love,
is as you know, is our little Dhananjay.

02:26:03.114 --> 02:26:11.654
He is such a young boy and he is also, I
think, is a born genius, something like that.

02:26:11.681 --> 02:26:16.964
These days lots of prodigies are born. I
think he is also a prodigy or something.

02:26:16.980 --> 02:26:26.162
See he plays so well. I mean to play this raga, in such a beautiful manner and this is a western instrument again.

02:26:26.171 --> 02:26:32.154
To play on this western instrument,
he really... if you know Vivaldi,

02:26:32.154 --> 02:26:37.214
if you have heard Vivaldi, many a
time it sounded like Vivaldi today.

02:26:37.229 --> 02:26:39.251
Do you think so?

02:26:41.093 --> 02:26:46.091
And this is something remarkable
again at this young age.

02:26:46.090 --> 02:26:52.008
I don't know what to say, but all My
blessings and I take the bad eye from them.

02:26:52.028 --> 02:26:55.718
Nobody should do anything wrong to these boys.

02:26:55.740 --> 02:26:59.578
He couldn't come. It's a big story.  He couldn't come.

02:26:59.604 --> 02:27:04.136
They said, "You pay no income tax." At this
young age who can pay income tax in India?

02:27:04.150 --> 02:27:06.650
And moreover he's the son of a farmer.

02:27:06.650 --> 02:27:10.616
In India, farmers are not paying any income tax.

02:27:10.634 --> 02:27:16.791
So, the Italians thought, they are
not paying income tax, so how can they go?

02:27:16.805 --> 02:27:20.354
They might start working here or
something. I don't know what was the idea.

02:27:20.373 --> 02:27:28.811
but thank God, it came into My...
just into My own inspiration

02:27:28.828 --> 02:27:30.961
I felt I better tell Guido.

02:27:30.978 --> 02:27:33.081
And Guido knows somebody there, luckily.

02:27:33.081 --> 02:27:37.599
Now anybody who doesn't get visas, tell Guido.

02:27:40.919 --> 02:27:42.919
For Italy!

02:27:42.900 --> 02:27:46.250
Because they are very troublesome. They have
become very funny now all these Italians.

02:27:46.291 --> 02:27:49.720
I don't know, but they have become quite funny.

02:27:49.731 --> 02:27:54.440
And when they are coming only for 2 or 3
days, what is there to trouble them so much.

02:27:54.440 --> 02:28:00.840
So he went down and he...

02:28:00.860 --> 02:28:09.700
Guido had told somebody there, whom
he knows and they gave him the visa.

02:28:09.708 --> 02:28:11.708
So he came to the Customs

02:28:11.699 --> 02:28:14.518
and the Customs said, "Why are
you carrying this big instrument?"

02:28:14.552 --> 02:28:18.142
They thought he was coming here to sell it, you see.

02:28:18.132 --> 02:28:25.292
He said, "You see, I am going for a programme of
Shri Mataji." In India! He showed him the badge.

02:28:25.316 --> 02:28:28.962
The Customs know Me there very
well. They said. "All right. Go."

02:28:28.982 --> 02:28:31.538
But surprisingly here in...

02:28:36.608 --> 02:28:43.928
when he came here, the Airport Authority again,
objected to his carrying this instrument.

02:28:43.928 --> 02:28:48.168
Again he showed My badge and
they said, "All right, go!"

02:28:48.190 --> 02:28:55.580
So, I think now Sahaja Yoga is... everywhere
is acceptable, at least in Italy it is now.

02:28:55.607 --> 02:28:58.107
And it's a very great thing.

02:29:08.409 --> 02:29:12.602
There is something about Italians I've felt always,

02:29:12.617 --> 02:29:19.222
that they are very simple-hearted people, good people and also something like Indians.

02:29:19.266 --> 02:29:24.992
You see, their ways are different little bit, but they can cheat as much as Indians can cheat.

02:29:29.222 --> 02:29:35.382
But Indian cheating is different and
the Italian cheating is another style.

02:29:36.186 --> 02:29:43.983
But still, I must say they are very sensitive to
spirituality and they all have great love for Me.

02:29:44.003 --> 02:29:49.360
"Madre." All the time they say and they just... I tell you, I am surprised how they accept Me.

02:29:49.373 --> 02:29:52.420
This I can't expect from Germans,

02:29:52.433 --> 02:29:55.453
I can't expect this from English,

02:29:55.453 --> 02:29:57.953
from the France, of course no question.

02:30:04.463 --> 02:30:09.914
So the authorities also here are spiritual

02:30:09.927 --> 02:30:13.114
and surprisingly, when I was coming from Russia,

02:30:13.136 --> 02:30:20.379
in Moscow airport, we met
a very well known designer.

02:30:20.415 --> 02:30:22.379
They say he is the guru of designers

02:30:22.379 --> 02:30:24.879
and he just asked for his Realisation.

02:30:24.879 --> 02:30:29.627
Then another lady came, she is very well
known here, she also asked for Realisation.

02:30:29.622 --> 02:30:33.127
Then another gentleman, who was some
sort of a minister or something,

02:30:33.127 --> 02:30:37.382
he also asked for his Realisation. Can you imagine?

02:30:37.387 --> 02:30:42.407
In what country, people can
ask Realisation like this?

02:30:42.417 --> 02:30:46.447
And now they are trying to contact us.

02:30:46.465 --> 02:30:49.565
So we are very well placed here in Italy, I think

02:30:49.575 --> 02:30:57.845
and I feel quite safe with these people,
because they have respect for Mother.

02:30:57.863 --> 02:30:59.933
They have respect for children

02:30:59.977 --> 02:31:04.603
and that the Ganesh Puja should be
here is a very, very, good thing,

02:31:04.643 --> 02:31:10.098
because the respect for children is
as mush as in India, maybe more.

02:31:10.103 --> 02:31:13.918
In this country you don't
find funny things happening.

02:31:13.947 --> 02:31:19.658
So tomorrow again, we will
have a nice session of Puja,

02:31:19.648 --> 02:31:24.362
but Sandesh is the one, I would say,

02:31:24.362 --> 02:31:30.658
for whom I must thank him, because I was
thinking his hands would be paining now.

02:31:33.167 --> 02:31:37.421
We have known him very well and
every time he plays something new.

02:31:37.433 --> 02:31:44.283
He is working so hard and he
has achieved such excellence.

02:31:44.313 --> 02:31:48.023
Now about Avi, I don't know what to say,

02:31:48.038 --> 02:31:50.538
because he is nothing but creativity personified.

02:31:50.538 --> 02:31:52.275
I don't know...

02:31:52.295 --> 02:31:56.815
Baba Mama told me, "I don't know how he
creates things, how it comes to him."

02:31:56.814 --> 02:32:04.368
and such creation of this
raga, is not so easy you know.

02:32:04.384 --> 02:32:06.884
It just has so much expansion.

02:32:06.884 --> 02:32:15.149
But the way he changed every
time, a new sort of a composition.

02:32:15.139 --> 02:32:21.389
But they don't have anybody like Vivaldi
or 'Waldi' or anyone in front of them

02:32:21.386 --> 02:32:24.860
and the way he was really, I tell you...

02:32:24.893 --> 02:32:27.153
I don't know how to say,

02:32:27.153 --> 02:32:33.383
but I am so lucky that even in this country
I can hear and enjoy such nice music

02:32:33.392 --> 02:32:36.303
and that you all are enjoying such nice music,

02:32:36.303 --> 02:32:39.773
thanks to these four young people.

02:32:39.782 --> 02:32:46.341
Now, because it was Ganesha's
Day, we are celebrating here,

02:32:46.370 --> 02:32:49.631
I thought we should get all the
young people who are not yet married.

02:32:49.658 --> 02:32:53.663
But I am told here, Avi is getting married, so
next year he will not come for Ganesha Puja,

02:32:53.683 --> 02:32:56.183
but can come for another Puja.

02:32:57.825 --> 02:33:01.165
And Sandesh, I don't know why
he doesn't want to get married.

02:33:04.007 --> 02:33:07.276
So it was not to be done by married people,

02:33:07.321 --> 02:33:12.156
but Baba Mama sent somebody from
there to show what they have achieved

02:33:12.162 --> 02:33:15.738
And this Nick has married an Indian lady

02:33:15.749 --> 02:33:19.869
and that was really remarkable.

02:33:19.869 --> 02:33:23.789
So, we all should give them a big, big, big hand.

02:33:53.442 --> 02:33:59.882
Now I am sorry for this cold weather, suddenly
it has come, I think, with Russians I think.

02:34:02.422 --> 02:34:05.972
In Russia, I was dressed up
like an Eskimo all the time.

02:34:07.518 --> 02:34:17.395
And this is a very cold today, but I think daytime will be good tomorrow and also it might improve a little bit.

02:34:17.414 --> 02:34:23.896
There is one thing I have to explain,
because Michael Fogarty asked me a question

02:34:23.910 --> 02:34:30.426
that, "What is the tradition? Is the Classical
Music is first or the other thing is?"

02:34:30.426 --> 02:34:33.392
Actually, we have changed it a little bit here.

02:34:33.392 --> 02:34:45.152
Why? Because they come out with very good films and last time they showed us a very beautiful film from America,

02:34:45.162 --> 02:34:50.612
and all their programmes were very
good, but they needed darkness.

02:34:50.610 --> 02:34:55.482
So we started their programme
after 10 o'clock or 10.30,

02:34:55.482 --> 02:35:01.472
because then we said all right, the classical music
we can have even in the daytime doesn't matter,

02:35:01.505 --> 02:35:04.042
So we changed, but today is the other way round,

02:35:04.082 --> 02:35:09.632
somebody came to see me and I was delayed
also and it became dark very fast.

02:35:09.650 --> 02:35:16.202
So I don't know what to do now. You changed
according to the need and here it is.

02:35:16.208 --> 02:35:21.961
I hope you people do not mind the second shift.

02:35:24.840 --> 02:35:32.300
One thing about classical music
is, that it does settle you down

02:35:32.333 --> 02:35:40.656
and to me, it's nice to have
something classical first,

02:35:40.671 --> 02:35:43.171
not all, but a little bit at least.

02:35:43.171 --> 02:35:48.270
It helps, helps us to meditate
and to come to the proper mood,

02:35:48.270 --> 02:35:52.980
but today it was in this way and I
hope you all enjoyed it very much.

02:35:53.017 --> 02:35:55.517
So now the second shift is there.

02:35:55.517 --> 02:36:00.132
There's going to be an interval for
about 5-10 minutes and after that,

02:36:00.138 --> 02:36:08.506
we will start the second one and hero
is Alex, who is going to do the job.
