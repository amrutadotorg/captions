00:05:47.311 --> 00:05:52.878
Guido: Shri Mataji just asked me to share
with you what was the last experience

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:56.765
of Her Divine visit in Russia.

00:05:56.946 --> 00:06:02.274
And I must say it was really a dramatic
breakthrough,

00:06:02.475 --> 00:06:11.030
because in the scientific conference that
She had in Moscow,

00:06:11.447 --> 00:06:17.369
there was the participation of a very
well-known scientist, a physicist.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.098
His name is Anatoly Akimov,

00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:26.364
he is very well known all over Russia
and all over the world also.

00:06:26.565 --> 00:06:33.799
And he came with a theory - and he’s been
studying on this theory for a few years -

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:42.394
which is based on the vacuum body; and
he studied something like the torsion field.

00:06:42.595 --> 00:06:47.957
And he could explain in a very clear way,
in a very scientific way,

00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:52.486
the vibrations that Shri Mataji is
emitting.

00:06:52.687 --> 00:06:58.714
So, at the beginning he was studying
some yogis which were meditating,

00:06:58.915 --> 00:07:08.504
and he could notice that they were emitting
vibrations, there was an aura around them.

00:07:08.705 --> 00:07:13.356
But then, when he came to Shri Mataji,
when he saw Her pictures,

00:07:13.557 --> 00:07:19.221
the miraculous pictures, then really
he could find out what it was

00:07:19.422 --> 00:07:25.986
and he said that in Her case, it was
something which is infinite,

00:07:26.208 --> 00:07:32.069
which is unlimited. And also it was very
nice, because at one point he said:

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:38.072
"As a man of science, I have to admit
that all the scientists

00:07:38.273 --> 00:07:44.738
that so far made some exceptional,
unique discovery...,

00:07:44.939 --> 00:07:50.230
I have to admit that all this didn’t come

00:07:50.431 --> 00:07:55.440
through some scientific process,
through the brain, we can say;

00:07:55.641 --> 00:08:01.695
but it came only through some Divine
inspiration”.

00:08:01.896 --> 00:08:07.209
Say, we can mention Newton, we can mention
Einstein and so on.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:11.533
And he said: "Also in my case, when
I was studying

00:08:11.734 --> 00:08:15.542
and working on this theory, at some point,
when I saw

00:08:15.743 --> 00:08:19.024
the picture of Shri Mataji, then I got
the inspiration."

00:08:19.225 --> 00:08:25.513
And then now Shri Mataji has invited him
in September to come.

00:08:25.714 --> 00:08:31.588
And he has already written a book in Russia
which will be translated in English

00:08:31.789 --> 00:08:38.653
and he is preparing a new book on which
of course the major topic will be

00:08:38.854 --> 00:08:45.094
this unique discovery. So now we have
somebody who has scientifically proved

00:08:45.295 --> 00:08:48.976
What Shri Mataji Is.

00:09:51.554 --> 00:10:00.689
In Russia the people somehow are very
open-minded.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:04.882
Not only that, the scientists specially

00:10:05.083 --> 00:10:09.800
are very open-minded and were suppressed
very much,

00:10:10.001 --> 00:10:16.425
so they tried to find out the subtler
things;

00:10:16.626 --> 00:10:21.118
not only finding out about

00:10:21.686 --> 00:10:29.322
chemicals or about some physical properties
of the light,

00:10:29.523 --> 00:10:34.771
but they wanted to go into the subtler
side.

00:10:34.972 --> 00:10:43.558
And they had find, found out already
a great deal of knowledge

00:10:43.759 --> 00:10:48.500
about the auras – auras around the head,
auras around the body –

00:10:48.701 --> 00:10:51.623
they had done so much of research

00:10:51.824 --> 00:10:56.270
and was accepted all over the world,
their findings.

00:10:56.471 --> 00:10:59.591
Now this gentleman was a specialist,
I think,

00:10:59.792 --> 00:11:03.254
because he’s a very well-known, very,
very well-known person

00:11:03.454 --> 00:11:06.114
and he’s holding a very big position.

00:11:06.315 --> 00:11:11.040
He was saying that he was, he has to run
150 organizations –

00:11:11.241 --> 00:11:14.272
very humble and very nice person.

00:11:14.473 --> 00:11:21.080
And when he came out with this discovery
I was happy in a way,

00:11:21.281 --> 00:11:27.477
because scientifically if it is proved,
then nobody can challenge it.

00:11:27.678 --> 00:11:32.355
He has already written a book with
all the algebraical complications

00:11:32.556 --> 00:11:37.758
of what he wanted to prove. And he said
there is a vacuum,

00:11:37.959 --> 00:11:40.333
beyond the consciousness there’s vacuum,

00:11:40.534 --> 00:11:45.273
and in that vacuum only you can know
the reality.

00:11:45.475 --> 00:11:50.185
And once all this becomes the reality
it is a science,

00:11:50.386 --> 00:11:53.204
and that’s how it is made into science.

00:11:53.405 --> 00:11:56.174
He showed so many of My photographs,

00:11:56.374 --> 00:11:59.855
specially the one where lot of energy
is coming out

00:12:00.055 --> 00:12:03.133
of My Sahasrara when we are on a boat.

00:12:03.334 --> 00:12:07.759
So he said, “She is the Source of all
the cosmic energy.”

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:14.735
And that’s what is Adi Shakti is:
She’s the one who creates everything.

00:12:15.245 --> 00:12:22.212
The whole atmosphere that we know of
is very artificial,

00:12:22.413 --> 00:12:29.829
but when you understand what She has done...
The first thing She does is to –

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:34.667
in My book also I have written down
about it, but I would like to tell you –

00:12:34.868 --> 00:12:43.211
that Her first, should say, manifestation
is on the left-hand side.

00:12:43.412 --> 00:12:47.331
That’s the Mahakali’s manifestation.

00:12:47.532 --> 00:12:52.782
So She comes on the Mahakali system,
the left-hand side,

00:12:52.983 --> 00:12:57.470
and that is where She created Ganesha.

00:12:57.671 --> 00:13:04.833
Shri Ganesha is created because His purity,
His innocence

00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:12.137
and auspiciousness, this had to be created
before She created the universe.

00:13:12.338 --> 00:13:18.394
So first thing She does is to create
Shri Ganesha, and She settled down.

00:13:18.585 --> 00:13:22.124
Then She goes up, of course in the body
of the Virata,

00:13:22.331 --> 00:13:25.297
and then She goes round and goes up

00:13:25.498 --> 00:13:32.828
on the right-hand side in the other way;
and there She creates all the universes –

00:13:33.029 --> 00:13:40.153
as you call them, bhuvanas. One universe –
there are fourteen bhuvanas –

00:13:40.354 --> 00:13:46.040
means these many, many universes made,
make one bhuvana.

00:13:46.241 --> 00:13:51.157
And She creates all these things
on the right-hand side.

00:13:51.358 --> 00:13:55.788
Then She goes up and then She descends down,

00:13:55.989 --> 00:14:00.819
creating all the chakras, Adi Chakras
or the peethas.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:08.397
She comes down, makes all these peethas
and then She’s settled as the Kundalini.

00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:13.205
But Adi Shakti is not fully the Kundalini,
we can say –

00:14:13.406 --> 00:14:20.769
Kundalini is, is a part of it. The rest
of the work is much more than this.

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:23.670
So the, all the, we call it the residual
energy – means

00:14:23.871 --> 00:14:28.076
after going through all this journey, then
She comes round

00:14:28.277 --> 00:14:35.180
and She goes as Kundalini. Because of this
Kundalini and the chakras,

00:14:35.381 --> 00:14:44.254
She creates a area which we call
as the chakras in the body.

00:14:44.455 --> 00:14:47.963
Now first She creates these chakras
in the head:

00:14:48.164 --> 00:14:52.162
we call them the peethas of the chakras.
And then She comes down

00:14:52.363 --> 00:14:59.302
and creates these chakras, which are
in the body of the Virata.

00:14:59.503 --> 00:15:04.435
Now once this has happened, then She
creates human beings,

00:15:04.636 --> 00:15:08.649
but not directly: through the evolutionary
process

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:12.656
She goes through, and that’s how
the evolution starts.

00:15:12.857 --> 00:15:19.473
And then it starts developing from
the minute,

00:15:19.674 --> 00:15:27.824
small little microscopic organisms
in the water, and then it starts evolving.

00:15:28.025 --> 00:15:32.081
So when She creates water and She creates
all the universes,

00:15:32.282 --> 00:15:38.398
She chooses this Mother Earth as the best
place to play Her evolutionary process,

00:15:38.599 --> 00:15:42.934
and there She makes this little microscopic
thing.

00:15:43.135 --> 00:15:47.523
Of course I have written all about it, and
when My book will be released

00:15:47.724 --> 00:15:52.913
you can see that how first hydrogen, carbon

00:15:53.114 --> 00:15:58.706
and oxygen and all of these things were
mixed up and how nitrogen comes into play,

00:15:58.907 --> 00:16:02.018
and how a living process starts.

00:16:02.218 --> 00:16:04.429
All this I have done it in My another book

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.699
that I am going to write now. I mean,
I have mostly finished,

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.756
but there’s some more chakras are to be
dealt with.

00:16:10.957 --> 00:16:14.473
Now with this happening, you see,
one thing is there

00:16:14.674 --> 00:16:17.748
that whatever I write, now people
won’t doubt.

00:16:17.949 --> 00:16:23.635
They will know it’s a scientific fact, and
that’s what whatever I say is a fact.

00:16:23.836 --> 00:16:33.327
Now to believe in the car… in the, even,
a Mother, Adi Shakti, was impossible.

00:16:33.528 --> 00:16:36.755
Specially you’ll be amazed that Christian
religion

00:16:36.955 --> 00:16:40.320
somehow or other avoided the mentioning
of the Mother.

00:16:40.521 --> 00:16:45.775
Then the Islam, that also avoided
the mentioning of the Mother.

00:16:45.976 --> 00:16:49.449
There’s completely negation towards
the Mother.

00:16:49.656 --> 00:16:53.390
But only Indian philosophy had the Mother,

00:16:53.591 --> 00:16:57.005
and the Indians are actually
Shakti-worshippers.

00:16:57.206 --> 00:17:03.781
So this is how it was kept up and brought
to this position now,

00:17:03.982 --> 00:17:10.003
that people have got, people have got
full idea

00:17:10.204 --> 00:17:16.057
as to Mother Principle that has worked out
everything.

00:17:16.258 --> 00:17:19.187
On this Mother Principle in India people
are very sure

00:17:19.388 --> 00:17:24.994
that it’s the Mother who does everything,
and thus we have in India many,

00:17:25.195 --> 00:17:32.144
we should say, many swayambus, means things
that are created of the Mother Earth.

00:17:32.345 --> 00:17:37.436
For example, you know in Maharashtra
we have got Mahakali’s place,

00:17:37.637 --> 00:17:45.094
Mahasaraswati, Mahalakshmi, and also
we have got a place for the Adi Shakti.

00:17:45.295 --> 00:17:50.545
Some people who have been to Nasik must
have seen Chaturshringi.

00:17:50.746 --> 00:17:58.071
How many people have you been
to Chaturshringi, out of you? – it’s good.

00:17:58.357 --> 00:18:04.289
So this Chaturshringi represents
the Adi Shakti:

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:08.679
Adi Shakti which is the fourth dimension

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:15.055
of this Power, which gives you the ascent.

00:18:15.256 --> 00:18:20.936
And ultimately through Mahalakshmi channel
only, you get your realization.

00:18:21.137 --> 00:18:29.581
All this is a process, all was created
by the power of Adi Shakti.

00:18:29.782 --> 00:18:35.642
It’s a tremendous task. The previous ones
were not difficult,

00:18:35.843 --> 00:18:40.479
because there, for nature to create,
was very easy.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.499
The Mother Earth is one with
the Adi Shakti,

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.582
the whole atmosphere is one
with the Adi Shakti,

00:18:46.783 --> 00:18:49.108
all the elements are one
with the Adi Shakti,

00:18:49.309 --> 00:18:52.684
so She could create all that without
any difficulties.

00:18:52.892 --> 00:18:58.252
But when human beings came, they got
their freedom.

00:18:58.453 --> 00:19:03.883
That’s the only, I should say, the species
which fell into the maya

00:19:04.084 --> 00:19:10.654
of thinking and of having the ego in them.

00:19:10.855 --> 00:19:14.975
With this ego a maya worked on them,
I should say,

00:19:15.176 --> 00:19:21.951
and they forgot about the Principle that
created this universe –

00:19:22.152 --> 00:19:27.013
they took it for granted. They felt that
this is their own right that they are there,

00:19:27.214 --> 00:19:32.376
this is their own achievement and they are
the owners of everything.

00:19:32.577 --> 00:19:37.595
This started working in their minds so much
that they invaded other countries,

00:19:37.795 --> 00:19:42.133
they destroyed so many people and they
never felt bad about it.

00:19:42.334 --> 00:19:45.635
All their lives they have been thinking
about aggressing others,

00:19:45.835 --> 00:19:49.807
controlling others and doing all kinds
of harmful things.

00:19:50.008 --> 00:19:56.466
But they never even thought or never did
any introspection to see

00:19:56.667 --> 00:20:01.670
that what we are doing is very, very wrong
and it should not be done.

00:20:01.871 --> 00:20:05.913
Because of the freedom they have, there’s
such a turmoil in this world.

00:20:06.114 --> 00:20:11.448
And the people who were in charge
of affairs, they were very, very cruel

00:20:11.649 --> 00:20:18.724
and extremely – had no feelings
for the other people.

00:20:18.925 --> 00:20:23.223
And this happened so many times in the,
on this earth.

00:20:23.424 --> 00:20:28.721
Now Sahaja Yoga has started. Once
Sahaja Yoga has started,

00:20:28.922 --> 00:20:36.714
we have Sahaja yogis who are now receiving
the blessings of the Adi Shakti directly.

00:20:36.915 --> 00:20:41.359
But still I must say, among Sahaja yogis
also we don’t have people

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:47.090
whom I would call as very well-matured.

00:20:47.291 --> 00:20:51.523
They are Sahaja yogis, some of them,
are just because it’s a fashion;

00:20:51.724 --> 00:20:54.995
maybe it should be better from their angle,

00:20:55.195 --> 00:20:59.834
or from their selfish angle or whatever
it is. Is a very wrong thing.

00:21:00.034 --> 00:21:07.007
If you are in Sahaja Yoga you must know now
you are responsible for the whole world.

00:21:07.208 --> 00:21:10.701
You are the only people who have
come forward,

00:21:10.906 --> 00:21:14.188
you are the only people who have achieved
something.

00:21:14.389 --> 00:21:18.318
And then at this juncture you should behave
in a manner

00:21:18.519 --> 00:21:23.970
that, that behoves a big saint or
a realized soul;

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:29.760
but sometimes you find them behaving
in such a manner, is shocking sometimes.

00:21:29.962 --> 00:21:33.741
They have no respect for themselves
or for others,

00:21:33.942 --> 00:21:36.906
and their whole attitude is very funny.

00:21:37.107 --> 00:21:40.938
Some of them are money-oriented, some
of them are power-oriented.

00:21:41.139 --> 00:21:45.826
And those who are power-oriented are more
dangerous, I think, than money-oriented;

00:21:46.027 --> 00:21:53.660
because those who are power-oriented try
to bring such bad name to Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:53.861 --> 00:21:58.332
They are very insulting, dominating and
horrible people.

00:21:58.533 --> 00:22:05.256
Their whole attitude is to achieve power
in Sahaja Yoga, and they try all tricks

00:22:05.457 --> 00:22:09.978
to achieve that power. But for some time
they, they look all right –

00:22:10.179 --> 00:22:15.445
after some time you’ll find they’ll all
disappear from the field of Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:15.676 --> 00:22:21.263
It’s a very big cleansing process going on.
You must understand that you have come

00:22:21.464 --> 00:22:31.589
in the, in the field of very high
consciousness

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:35.379
where you are in contact with the Divine.

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:39.692
Now here if you behave like ordinary people

00:22:39.893 --> 00:22:44.395
who have no divinity within them, how long
will you continue like this?

00:22:44.595 --> 00:22:51.388
So this is very important that you should
try to meditate and evolve yourselves,

00:22:51.589 --> 00:22:55.703
and become really very good Sahaja yogis.

00:22:55.904 --> 00:23:00.653
In some places we are very, very lucky.
In some, some countries we are

00:23:00.854 --> 00:23:03.937
very, very lucky. But in some countries
I find

00:23:04.138 --> 00:23:08.738
the people are just deaf and dumb.
They can’t understand Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:08.939 --> 00:23:13.591
For My program they do come, and
afterwards just they disappear.

00:23:13.792 --> 00:23:19.219
This one I think is also – Sahaja yogis
are responsible for this.

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:26.924
The way they go about, the way they want
to do Sahaj work is not Sahaj.

00:23:27.125 --> 00:23:31.524
Must be something definitely wrong with
the whole thing, and that’s why

00:23:31.725 --> 00:23:37.549
it’s not working out the same way as
it is working out in many places.

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:43.682
So I have to tell you that all this is
there, that Adi Shakti is there,

00:23:43.883 --> 00:23:46.365
and all this has happened through
Adi Shakti.

00:23:46.566 --> 00:23:50.963
But now the further work has to be done
through you people

00:23:51.164 --> 00:23:56.687
because you are the channels, you are
the one who have to transform people.

00:23:56.888 --> 00:24:05.529
Now everybody should understand and know
how many people we have given realization.

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:10.773
We have to think about it: what have
we done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:24:10.974 --> 00:24:14.339
Once I was traveling by plane and I saw
it was so –

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:19.457
met a lady who was sitting next to Me,
and she was so hot, I couldn’t understand.

00:24:19.658 --> 00:24:22.727
Then she told me she is a disciple
of a guru

00:24:22.928 --> 00:24:27.015
and very proud of it, and she started
telling Me all about him and things.

00:24:27.216 --> 00:24:31.457
I was amazed, that look at this woman,
she hasn’t got anything from him

00:24:31.658 --> 00:24:34.237
and she was just saying, “I have given
so much money to him,

00:24:34.438 --> 00:24:37.024
I have done this thing to him,” and all
those things.

00:24:37.225 --> 00:24:41.755
But she had nothing, and despite that she
was talking to Me,

00:24:41.955 --> 00:24:44.571
a stranger person, about the guru.

00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:48.156
But in Sahaja Yoga I’ve seen people are
rather shy.

00:24:48.379 --> 00:24:51.874
They don’t want to talk about Sahaja Yoga
openly to others,

00:24:52.084 --> 00:24:57.626
which is a very wrong thing you are doing
because you are responsible for this work.

00:24:57.827 --> 00:25:02.378
You have been given realization – of course
you were seeking, everything is all right –

00:25:02.579 --> 00:25:06.987
but all of you must try to give
realizations to others.

00:25:07.187 --> 00:25:13.072
I must say that somehow men have been
more dynamic and working it out.

00:25:13.273 --> 00:25:18.132
The women in Sahaja Yoga are not yet
coming up to that level as they should.

00:25:18.333 --> 00:25:22.485
They have to be more sensible about it,
and they have to work it out.

00:25:22.685 --> 00:25:26.108
They can do it, but only trouble is,
I think they have

00:25:26.309 --> 00:25:30.766
certain minor problems about which
they are worried.

00:25:30.967 --> 00:25:34.364
Always I get letters from ladies saying
this is wrong,

00:25:34.565 --> 00:25:38.225
that is wrong, complaining all the time;

00:25:38.426 --> 00:25:40.760
when I’m so fed up of their letters now

00:25:40.961 --> 00:25:46.676
that I think they’re useless to read them
also. So I have to tell you all,

00:25:46.877 --> 00:25:51.764
that it is important that men, because
they are dynamic,

00:25:51.965 --> 00:25:58.084
women should be much more, because they are
shakti and I am a woman.

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:04.087
So I find that the men are more sort of
active and dynamic

00:26:04.288 --> 00:26:08.686
about Sahaja Yoga, and I don’t know what is
the reason why women are not.

00:26:08.887 --> 00:26:14.225
They can transform so many people.

00:26:14.426 --> 00:26:21.176
They can do so much good to others. They
can bring so much love and compassion,

00:26:21.377 --> 00:26:27.588
because this love and compassion is
a quality of a mother, of a woman.

00:26:27.789 --> 00:26:32.632
And if the women don’t have that quality,
it’s useless to be a woman.

00:26:32.833 --> 00:26:38.359
All the time if you are busy about your
useless things

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:43.984
like fashions or faces and all that, then
the time is all wasted.

00:26:44.185 --> 00:26:47.322
You have a short time now, you’ve got
your realization

00:26:47.523 --> 00:26:53.124
and you must decide what have you done
so far, what have you achieved for so far.

00:26:53.324 --> 00:26:56.976
But I would say that also in Sahaja Yoga
I’ve found

00:26:57.177 --> 00:27:03.533
there are all kinds of funny ideas growing
here. Like certain rituals they’ll take up.

00:27:03.734 --> 00:27:07.285
Then they prescribe certain rituals,
they’ll talk about it.

00:27:07.581 --> 00:27:12.803
And kind of a power-orientation is there.
They want to oppress others,

00:27:13.004 --> 00:27:16.353
and they want to take over and frighten
people

00:27:16.554 --> 00:27:22.585
and behave in such a manner that, as if
they are very good.

00:27:22.786 --> 00:27:28.576
Some of them start saying that “Mataji
said so. This is Mataji’s ideas.”

00:27:28.777 --> 00:27:36.450
By their own power-orientation they
manufacture things and talk like that and…

00:27:36.651 --> 00:27:40.081
But ask them, “How many have you given
realization?”

00:27:40.282 --> 00:27:44.084
The first thing is, you must determine
is positivity:

00:27:44.284 --> 00:27:46.586
how many you have given realization?

00:27:46.787 --> 00:27:51.956
Is just talking about others, criticizing
others, talking about

00:27:52.157 --> 00:27:56.875
the defects of Sahaja Yoga, seeing
in the Sahaj Yog;

00:27:57.076 --> 00:28:01.165
is I would say, is still a very preliminary
things

00:28:01.366 --> 00:28:05.575
that have happened before, and it should
stop.

00:28:05.776 --> 00:28:08.768
Now as it is, once this book is out,

00:28:08.969 --> 00:28:14.804
all over the world it will be known about
our work; we’ll be not challenged any more.

00:28:15.004 --> 00:28:23.025
But still we have to see for ourselves that
if we have achieved

00:28:23.226 --> 00:28:28.084
this kind of recognition then we should
be up to that,

00:28:28.284 --> 00:28:33.255
our capability should be up to that.
We should not be lagging behind.

00:28:33.456 --> 00:28:38.685
For example, if you ask some Sahaja yogis,

00:28:38.885 --> 00:28:42.535
specially Sahaja yoginis, they don’t know
much about Sahaja Yoga,

00:28:42.736 --> 00:28:47.261
they don’t know about chakras, they don’t
know anything about the deities;

00:28:47.462 --> 00:28:50.979
nothing they know – how can they be
Sahaja yogis?

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:56.201
You have to know all about it. Only thing
that you don’t realize,

00:28:56.402 --> 00:29:02.190
that it’s not outside that you are a Sahaja
yogi but it is inside.

00:29:02.391 --> 00:29:08.167
Inside you have to have that kind
of an understanding of the chakras

00:29:08.368 --> 00:29:14.101
and of Sahaja Yoga, how it works,
how it helps you.

00:29:14.302 --> 00:29:21.054
Now supposing if I’m the Source of that
energy, which you know very well I am,

00:29:21.255 --> 00:29:27.278
then you achieve yours also, a kind
of a perfection about

00:29:27.479 --> 00:29:31.387
dealing with people and bringing them
to Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:31.588 --> 00:29:38.983
Is a very important work you have to do,
is to bring Sahaja yogis in Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:39.184 --> 00:29:44.306
What I find that some people are very much
still lagging behind,

00:29:44.507 --> 00:29:50.711
and it’s very surprising that they live
in that country,

00:29:50.912 --> 00:29:54.651
they are part and parcel of that country
and they are not bothered.

00:29:54.851 --> 00:29:59.226
Under these circumstances they’ll be
blamed, that “Why didn’t you do?

00:29:59.427 --> 00:30:07.045
Why didn’t you find out the ways and methods
of convincing at least your countrymen?”

00:30:07.246 --> 00:30:11.963
So Sahaja Yoga at the brink of growth

00:30:12.164 --> 00:30:15.005
cannot grow only with one country or two
countries;

00:30:15.205 --> 00:30:19.740
all the countries have to be brought
into Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:19.941 --> 00:30:28.161
All the people that we could call into
Sahaja Yoga will be a very good idea.

00:30:28.362 --> 00:30:34.011
And then we have books to convince people,
we have to talk to them about it.

00:30:34.212 --> 00:30:38.331
But what I find about Sahaja yogis,
that once they start

00:30:38.569 --> 00:30:41.560
spreading Sahaja Yoga also their ego
comes up,

00:30:41.761 --> 00:30:45.847
and this thing – they are very great Sahaja
yogis, they are great leaders –

00:30:46.048 --> 00:30:51.269
all this kind of stupid ideas walk into
their heads, which is wrong.

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:54.787
You have to just think in a very humble
manner.

00:30:54.988 --> 00:30:58.165
The more you have, the more you become
humble,

00:30:58.365 --> 00:31:02.642
like a tree when laden with fruits,
bends down.

00:31:02.843 --> 00:31:06.242
In the same way you have to be very humble.

00:31:06.443 --> 00:31:10.508
But that humility is sometimes very
difficult,

00:31:10.709 --> 00:31:13.900
because the culture of the West is not
humble culture –

00:31:14.101 --> 00:31:21.591
it’s a culture of aggression, culture
of domination. So far they have been,

00:31:21.792 --> 00:31:25.755
they think because of domination they could
go all over the world,

00:31:25.956 --> 00:31:28.963
they could achieve so many things.
What have they achieved?

00:31:29.164 --> 00:31:33.668
Nothing. In their own countries if you see,
there’s drug addiction.

00:31:33.869 --> 00:31:36.163
Why should people take to drugs so much?

00:31:36.364 --> 00:31:40.787
Then all kinds of sinful things they do
which I don’t want to mention,

00:31:40.988 --> 00:31:46.245
but you know what they are doing – which
in India, which is a poorer country,

00:31:46.446 --> 00:31:50.655
one cannot even think of. Such things
are happening around you,

00:31:50.856 --> 00:31:53.165
so find out what’s wrong where

00:31:53.365 --> 00:31:58.110
and how you can correct these things,
if you can help them.

00:31:58.311 --> 00:32:03.391
Actually now, as I told you, I am going
to start some sort of organizations

00:32:03.592 --> 00:32:07.410
that will do good to human beings.
But you all can join also.

00:32:07.611 --> 00:32:11.542
You can also start in your own countries
something like that.

00:32:11.743 --> 00:32:16.785
But first you have to get rid of your ego.

00:32:16.986 --> 00:32:22.330
See, that once happens to you, then only
your attention would be steady.

00:32:22.531 --> 00:32:26.863
And this ego is very simple for you because
you worship Christ,

00:32:27.064 --> 00:32:32.190
and the Christ is the one who was settled
on the Agnya chakra.

00:32:32.391 --> 00:32:36.558
You all worship Christ, but that humility
of Christ is not there –

00:32:36.759 --> 00:32:40.020
just the opposite of it. It has happened
everywhere

00:32:40.221 --> 00:32:44.736
that whatever is preached in the religion,
people did just the opposite of it.

00:32:44.937 --> 00:32:48.242
For example Hindu religion, I would say
Hindu philosophy

00:32:48.443 --> 00:32:52.528
is that in everybody resides the spirit.

00:32:52.729 --> 00:32:56.224
Now in everybody if there is spirit,
then how can you have

00:32:56.425 --> 00:33:01.666
different caste systems, and how can you
have somebody higher and lower?

00:33:01.867 --> 00:33:06.508
Other way round, now Christ has said that
you have to forgive,

00:33:06.709 --> 00:33:09.805
forgive everyone, and you have to humble
down.

00:33:10.006 --> 00:33:13.655
And that’s what one finds, that among
Christians

00:33:13.856 --> 00:33:17.936
they don’t know humility, they have no idea
of humility.

00:33:18.156 --> 00:33:23.063
Men are like that, women are like that,
and the men and women then go on fighting.

00:33:23.264 --> 00:33:27.545
There’s no question of anybody being
humble, peaceful and all that.

00:33:27.745 --> 00:33:30.483
So it’s very artificially they are

00:33:30.684 --> 00:33:33.601
showing off that they are very
philanthropist and all that,

00:33:33.802 --> 00:33:37.598
but inside in their heart I don’t find
there is any love,

00:33:37.799 --> 00:33:40.952
there’s any compassion in the real sense
of the word.

00:33:41.153 --> 00:33:45.404
So when we are dealing with reality,
we have to know that we cannot just

00:33:45.605 --> 00:33:51.545
go on doing things which are artificial,
which are befooling others,

00:33:51.745 --> 00:33:56.013
but we have to really become that.
Once if you become that,

00:33:56.214 --> 00:34:01.303
when you are really like that, then only
you have done the job

00:34:01.504 --> 00:34:08.074
for which you are born at this juncture
of blossom-times.

00:34:08.275 --> 00:34:14.541
Otherwise you could have been born earlier
and could have been something different.

00:34:14.742 --> 00:34:18.104
But you are specially born so you realize
your value,

00:34:18.304 --> 00:34:22.924
realize yourself what you are and try
to understand,

00:34:23.124 --> 00:34:28.015
have a self-respect, and try to do things
which are very important

00:34:28.216 --> 00:34:33.919
as Sahaja yogis. Of course you are doing
a job, you are doing other things;

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:37.294
but you’ll be amazed, if you do work
of Sahaja Yoga

00:34:37.495 --> 00:34:42.045
you will find more time for everything.
Once you start doing God’s work,

00:34:42.246 --> 00:34:45.387
God does your work. And that’s how
you’ll be amazed

00:34:45.588 --> 00:34:49.340
how you get so much time to do
the right thing.

00:34:49.541 --> 00:34:56.094
Now it is for you to go back and
introspect, see for yourself.

00:34:56.295 --> 00:34:59.168
Now the Adi Shakti Herself has come.

00:34:59.359 --> 00:35:02.854
But I’m very simple, I’m very simple
to look at;

00:35:03.054 --> 00:35:09.613
in My behavior I’m very, very humble,
and people take Me for granted.

00:35:09.814 --> 00:35:13.396
I don’t do anything. I don’t want to punish
you, I don’t want to do anything like that.

00:35:13.597 --> 00:35:17.329
But you yourself get punished, you yourself
become useless

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:21.675
if you do not look after yourself
and grow yourself.

00:35:21.876 --> 00:35:27.414
This finding is so great, and this man
had never known Me before.

00:35:27.614 --> 00:35:33.369
He’s very learned but he’s very humble,
and what he told Me that,

00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:38.296
“Just imagine, I’m sitting before
the Creator of this world

00:35:38.497 --> 00:35:40.886
and still I’m very normal.”

00:35:41.087 --> 00:35:43.856
So I said, “What should happen to you,
what do you think?” So he said,

00:35:44.057 --> 00:35:47.939
“Mother, it’s a big thing to realize that
I am sitting before You,

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:54.288
and that You are here.” I said, “It’s good
that you don’t feel My presence

00:35:54.489 --> 00:36:00.620
so oppressive or so dominating.
I’m very happy.”

00:36:00.821 --> 00:36:06.585
“No,” he says, “I just feel the love, just
feel the compassion". That’s what it is.

00:36:06.786 --> 00:36:11.130
We have to know that we should have
just love and compassion;

00:36:11.331 --> 00:36:14.404
compassion and love for ourselves

00:36:14.605 --> 00:36:18.566
in the way that we should not harm
anybody’s heart.

00:36:18.767 --> 00:36:23.707
To say something to hurt someone
is very sinful.

00:36:23.908 --> 00:36:28.062
But some people enjoy that very much, they
think they are very clever – it’s not so.

00:36:28.263 --> 00:36:35.385
When you talk to someone you must say
something which is very soothing and good.

00:36:35.586 --> 00:36:38.794
Another thing is the temper of a person,
is a temper –

00:36:38.995 --> 00:36:42.823
that a slightest thing here and there,
they get into tempers.

00:36:43.024 --> 00:36:46.724
Now this has to be told, this temper, that
“You keep quiet.

00:36:46.925 --> 00:36:49.576
I have nothing to do with you.”
That is one thing.

00:36:49.777 --> 00:36:57.243
Then there are people who are very subtly,
I should say, power-oriented, very subtle.

00:36:57.444 --> 00:37:01.429
They have tricks and trades by which
they know how to control others.

00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:04.337
What are you going to gain out of it?

00:37:04.538 --> 00:37:08.175
What is your gain? By doing all
these things what will happen?

00:37:08.376 --> 00:37:13.013
In these worldly things you might be
little bit popular,

00:37:13.214 --> 00:37:18.733
little bit having a position or something;
but what is it, after all?

00:37:18.934 --> 00:37:22.528
That is not going to help you. What is
going to help you the most

00:37:22.729 --> 00:37:28.650
is to make yourself a perfect channel
for Sahaja Yoga, to be a perfect channel.

00:37:28.851 --> 00:37:34.117
In that you will be amazed how you’ll
be helped.

00:37:34.318 --> 00:37:38.018
So I would say for you people who are
in the West, I would say

00:37:38.219 --> 00:37:41.614
you must develop humility. It’s very
important.

00:37:41.815 --> 00:37:45.657
I was surprised, in Russia itself
the people are not only humble,

00:37:45.858 --> 00:37:51.403
but such dedication, such dedication –
unbelievable!

00:37:51.604 --> 00:37:56.003
They don’t even raise their eyes to Me.
I don’t know how they got this idea.

00:37:56.204 --> 00:37:59.619
This is not after the discovery, but even
before that.

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:06.497
They were so nice and so humble and
so full of love; and even the children

00:38:06.698 --> 00:38:11.636
brought Me small, small presents,
you know, just to give Me, so sweetly.

00:38:11.837 --> 00:38:15.636
This is something surprising how these
people in Russia

00:38:15.837 --> 00:38:19.513
have achieved that capability to become.

00:38:19.714 --> 00:38:23.819
And I think in the West, Russia is
the country

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:27.935
which will achieve a very great height
in spirituality,

00:38:28.135 --> 00:38:31.089
and that means they’ll be the most powerful
people.

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:34.037
Let us see what you are doing in your
own country

00:38:34.238 --> 00:38:36.373
and how you are going to work it out.

00:38:36.574 --> 00:38:40.255
See, there are so many things you can do
very easily,

00:38:40.455 --> 00:38:45.030
if you see for yourself that you are
the instrument of the Divine.

00:38:45.231 --> 00:38:49.821
And then your temperament will change,
the nature will change;

00:38:50.022 --> 00:38:55.718
you’ll become a very, very sweet person,
likable person,

00:38:55.919 --> 00:39:01.133
and everybody will think that this is
a saint walking around.

00:39:01.334 --> 00:39:05.489
So that’s all I have to say about this.
Whatever is the discovery

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:09.352
is not a discovery for Me, but discovery
for the whole world.

00:39:09.553 --> 00:39:18.066
And I’m sure once it is established and
is exposed to the whole world,

00:39:18.267 --> 00:39:21.492
things will change for you, and for Me
also.

00:39:21.693 --> 00:39:24.790
May God bless you.
