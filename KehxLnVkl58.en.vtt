00:07.200 --> 00:10.960
It is so wonderful for your Mother

00:11.080 --> 00:15.600
to see so many beautiful Sahaja yogis assembled together,

00:15.600 --> 00:19.120
on this day of Sahasrara.

00:31.760 --> 00:37.120
But what next, in the new era that has to come?

00:41.760 --> 00:48.960
As you have now good  families, good ashrams, good jobs,

00:48.880 --> 00:53.960
everyone is happy, let us think of the next era.

01:09.760 --> 01:13.680
Next era is of compassion, as I told you.

01:17.120 --> 01:21.680
But any one of the chakras are weak in you still;

01:26.240 --> 01:31.360
the light that becomes white because of the seven colors

01:31.360 --> 01:35.680
may dim out, or may be defective.

01:43.840 --> 01:49.640
So, all the chakras that are within us are to be looked after.

01:56.120 --> 02:03.800
To pay attention to every chakra, and put compassion,

02:04.720 --> 02:10.120
the feeling of compassion on these chakras.

02:24.840 --> 02:28.760
Now let us take the Chakra of Shri Ganesh.

02:32.880 --> 02:37.480
You pay attention to Shri Ganesha

02:37.560 --> 02:42.600
and establish Him through your thought,

02:42.480 --> 02:46.680
because now your thought is divine,

02:46.320 --> 02:51.720
in the Mooladhara Chakra, with great respect.

03:12.440 --> 03:15.800
Here now, you have to know

03:15.800 --> 03:19.720
that in the first era of Sahaja Yoga,

03:19.720 --> 03:23.520
I could not have talked of these things to you,

03:23.600 --> 03:30.840
This is much subtler doing, subtler work.

03:36.360 --> 03:42.120
Now put your feeling on that chakra.

03:41.760 --> 03:45.720
Chakra is the Pradesha, is the country,

03:45.720 --> 03:49.960
and the king is Shri Ganesh.

03:54.960 --> 03:58.320
And that's the country.

04:00.120 --> 04:04.920
Now when you put your attention onto that chakra,

04:04.920 --> 04:09.440
put your feelings towards Him,

04:17.560 --> 04:25.360
of feeling of love and adoration to Him, to begin with.

04:30.760 --> 04:34.520
And then to manifest compassion,

04:34.040 --> 04:38.160
you have to ask nothing but one thing, that

04:37.920 --> 04:42.640
"O God of Innocence,

04:42.560 --> 04:48.520
give innocence to all the people of the world."

04:59.160 --> 05:03.400
But first you have to be innocent to ask that;

05:03.400 --> 05:07.040
otherwise it is unauthorized asking,

05:06.880 --> 05:11.720
or you can say, you have no right to ask.

05:20.880 --> 05:25.960
So to understand innocence

05:25.960 --> 05:28.880
you should try to understand yourself,

05:28.600 --> 05:32.360
how your mind is working.

05:38.360 --> 05:43.480
When you, say, look at anyone,

05:43.240 --> 05:48.720
do you feel that you should possess that person?

05:48.600 --> 05:52.080
Do you feel unduly attracted,

05:52.120 --> 05:58.160
or something base feeling comes into your mind?

06:12.120 --> 06:14.520
For an innocent person,

06:14.520 --> 06:18.320
when he sees a beautiful person, or a woman,

06:18.320 --> 06:22.720
or a beautiful scene or a beautiful creation,

06:22.720 --> 06:25.600
the first thing should happen that he becomes thoughtless

06:25.600 --> 06:29.040
there’s no thought.

06:42.400 --> 06:45.200
So if there is no thought,

06:45.120 --> 06:49.440
there's no question of having any expression of possessiveness

06:49.600 --> 06:53.880
or any kind of a baser feeling.

07:06.080 --> 07:09.840
But if you pray to Shri Ganesha,

07:08.640 --> 07:12.760
also unauthorized a little bit, that

07:12.880 --> 07:16.520
"Please make me innocent,

07:16.440 --> 07:23.080
so that I'm empowered to ask You for this boon, that

07:23.080 --> 07:31.560
wherever I go I become the source of innocence.

07:45.120 --> 07:48.840
So that I emit innocence:

07:48.960 --> 07:52.560
when people look at me,

07:52.520 --> 07:55.720
they feel I am innocent."

08:04.040 --> 08:07.160
This is compassion,

08:08.600 --> 08:12.880
the compassion to ask Him

08:12.760 --> 08:17.960
to give you the power of compassion itself.

08:29.040 --> 08:36.640
So that, as you see here these beautiful centers, as if

08:36.600 --> 08:42.600
the light starts moving horizontally;

08:54.040 --> 08:59.560
it starts moving on the sympathetic nervous system.

09:02.520 --> 09:09.080
So you become the powerful innocence yourself.

09:12.680 --> 09:19.280
You don't become stupid or childish, but you become child-like.

09:26.080 --> 09:33.480
The whole behavior is extremely dignified and innocent.

09:37.960 --> 09:42.480
Normally if you find a person who is dignified,

09:41.840 --> 09:46.160
is normally he’s not an innocent person,

09:50.600 --> 09:53.760
because he puts up a show, it's a deliberation

09:53.800 --> 09:59.600
to become serious and show that he’s very dignified, to impress others.

10:06.040 --> 10:10.640
A child doesn’t put up the show of innocence,

10:10.640 --> 10:15.040
of dignity or anything,

10:15.040 --> 10:19.960
because the child is not aware of deliberations.

10:29.480 --> 10:35.400
But you develop that rare combination of innocent dignity.

10:45.720 --> 10:50.360
Now the other quality of, say, Shri Ganesha starts

10:50.480 --> 10:56.480
expressing itself on horizontal level,

10:56.320 --> 11:00.520
that you become discreet.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.520
But that is a power, I’m again saying,

11:11.520 --> 11:16.040
the power of discretion you develop.

11:20.360 --> 11:23.040
Now one must understand the difference

11:22.840 --> 11:28.120
between the power of discretion, and discretion itself.

11:31.720 --> 11:35.640
So “the power” means it acts.

11:40.120 --> 11:43.920
For example, you may not speak,

11:44.040 --> 11:48.760
but if you are standing somewhere the discretion itself will act

11:48.680 --> 11:51.400
in the situation.

12:00.440 --> 12:01.880
Like a Sahaja yogi,

12:01.880 --> 12:04.520
supposing is a good Sahaja yogi,

12:04.240 --> 12:07.400
is going in a train, and the train has an accident,

12:07.400 --> 12:12.800
mostly it will not have, but has, nobody will die.

12:24.000 --> 12:32.760
So you establish the discretion which is power itself,

12:32.720 --> 12:35.600
that acts by itself.

12:35.520 --> 12:38.480
You don't have to say that you act, it acts,

12:38.280 --> 12:42.280
but you just become the vehicle, a beautiful clean vehicle

12:42.400 --> 12:46.040
of that discretion.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.800
Then you should believe,

13:01.840 --> 13:06.880
now you are spreading horizontally.
