00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.000
Today I am going to address you
in English language,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.080
as desired by you.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.440
Even tomorrow perhaps we may
have to use this foreign language.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:24.560
Today’s subject is the relationship
between Kundalini and Kalki.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.680
The word kalki actually
is an abbreviation

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.920
of the word nishkalanka.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.440
Nishkalanka means the same
as My name is, which means nirmala —

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.080
that it is a spotlessly clean thing.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.640
Something that is spotlessly clean
is nishkalanka,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.120
without any spots on it.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.440
Now, this incarnation
has been described in many Puranas:

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.120
He will be coming on this Earth
on a white horse,

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.120
in a village of Sambalpur,
they call it, Sambhalpur.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.000
Is very interesting how people
take everything so literally.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.320
The word sambhala means:
bhala is this forehead,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.040
sambhala means “at that stage”.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.960
That means Kalki is situated
on your bhala.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.520
Bhala is the forehead,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.960
and here He is going to be born.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.120
That is the real meaning
of the word Sambhalpur.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:49.960
In between Jesus Christ
and His destroying incarnation

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.640
of Mahavishnu, called as Kalki,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:05.000
there is a time given to human beings
to rectify themselves,

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.720
for them to enter
into the Kingdom of God.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.640
Which in the Bible is called
as Last Judgement —

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.240
that you will be judged, all of you
will be judged on this Earth.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.120
The population of the world
is the maximum, they say,

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.200
because all those, practically all those
who had aspirations

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.200
to enter into the Kingdom of God

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.800
are born in the modern times
and are going to be born very soon.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.480
This is the most important time

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.600
because Sahaja Yoga
is the Last Judgement.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.440
It is fantastic to hear this,
but that’s a fact and is the truth.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.200
Though you can understand
that Mother’s love makes it very easy

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.240
for you to get to your Realisation

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.560
and that the whole story
of Last Judgement,

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.800
which looks such a horrifying
experience,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.840
has been made very beautiful
and very tender and delicate

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.840
and doesn’t disturb you.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.880
But this is the Last Judgement,
I tell you,

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.760
and you all are going to be judged
through Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.520
whether you can enter
into the Kingdom of God or not.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.480
Now, in Sahaja Yoga
people come in

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.840
with different kinds of attentions,
or chitta.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.560
There could be people who have
too much of tamasi krutya,

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.600
or what we call the inertia

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:52.560
or the more sort of sluggish
or slow-moving temperaments.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.160
These, when they are exaggerated,
people take to spirits

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.400
or take to alcohols
or to some such things

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.880
which take you away from Reality
and make you numb within.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.080
The other side is, as you know,

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.840
right-hand side people,
who have got too much ambitions.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.840
They are extremely ambitious people;
they want to win the whole world,

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.960
and they want to become
something independent on their own,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.840
malignant and cancerous.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.360
They do not want to keep
their relationship with the whole.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.520
You can see in this Kaliyuga
how people have gone to their extremes.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.880
Some of them are very much indulging
into too much of alcoholism,

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.120
or you can call it something [like]
running away from your awareness,

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.960
from your Self, from truth,
the beauty.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.960
The others are denying it.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.720
They are denying everything
that is beautiful and are ego-oriented.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.640
So we have people
who are superego-oriented:

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.760
very much conditioned, and lethargic,
and lazy, and absolutely primitive.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.280
The other side is
that we have people

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.400
who are extremely ambitious,
dominating

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.600
and are destroying each other
by their ambition and competition.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.520
These two types of people
of extreme nature

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.640
are rather difficult to enter
into Sahaja Yoga,

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:32.680
but the people who are in the centre
are easily absorbed in the Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.800
Moreover, people who are
less complicated,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
simple-hearted, as they are
in the villages,

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.160
are very easily absorbed
by Sahaja Yoga,

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.880
and they take to it
without any difficulty.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.160
Say, in the city you can see the result
of so much of work of Mine

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.240
that there are hardly about
two to three hundred people
today over here.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.120
But if I go to a village,

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.360
the whole village, say, up to five
to six thousand people come round,

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.160
and all of them get their Realisation
without any difficulty.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.280
Because here people are supposed
to be very busy,

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.720
they have so many
other preoccupations.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.320
They think other things are much more
important than seeking God

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.320
and wasting your time
in such pursuits like seeking God.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.240
Under such circumstances,
Sahaja Yoga takes its roots

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.560
very sweetly into the heart
of all the seekers.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.040
It works very spontaneously.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.080
You get your Realisation
without any difficulty,

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.320
without any effort,
without paying for it,

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.680
without going into any sort
of strenuous exercises.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.880
But when we talk of Kalki,
we have to remember

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.600
that between getting our Realisation
and entering into the Kingdom of God,

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.000
we can falter very much.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.200
This is called as yogabhrashta sthiti
(state of being fallen from yoga).

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.280
People take to yoga,
they come into yoga

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.880
and are then enchanted still
by their pravruttis (inclinations).

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.560
For example, an ego-oriented man
or a money-oriented man

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.680
or a man who wants to dominate

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:23.120
can form a group of people
whom he would dominate by his ideas

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.080
and can go in for a fall,
and the rest of them will also go down.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.560
In Sahaja Yoga itself.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.720
This has been happening
in Bombay very very often;

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.080
it’s a very very common thing
that has been going on.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.320
But this is called
as yogabhrashtata,

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.440
where a person falls from his yoga,
he comes down on his yoga —

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.040
because Sahaja Yoga gives you
all the freedom,
whether to fall or to come up.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.320
But if you go to any other guru,

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.040
doing any other sort of yoga
in which purification takes place

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.120
and where people are trained
and disciplined from very childhood,

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.440
in those yogas a guru
will somehow or other see

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.440
that you are injured
or you are hurt so badly

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.240
that you have no connections
with anybody else.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.040
It’s like an operation: they take out
that personality and throw him away.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.680
But here it is left to your freedom

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.120
to understand that you have to keep
to the mains,

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.120
you have to keep to the group,

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:24.480
you have to keep to the whole
and not to one person here and there

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.880
who is trying to overpower
the rest of you.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.920
In Sahaja Yoga, anybody who tries
to come up too much comes down

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.360
because in nature, you have seen,
nothing grows out of bounds.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.400
Like, human beings are
of a certain height,

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.160
the trees are of certain heights…

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.680
Everything is controlled.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.600
You cannot try to show off
in Sahaja Yoga,

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.480
neither you should try to make
a different group

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.560
or a different type
of some special thing.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.120
Specially I have seen in Sahaja Yoga
there are people

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.080
who come up and ask people
to touch their feet.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.680
It is most surprising that invariably
such people get exposed in no time,

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.520
and one knows
that they are gone cases

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.600
because their chakras are caught,
they are badly caught.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.960
Though they may not feel for a while,
their vibrations may be there,

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.920
but they go down and down and down
till they are completely finished.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.080
Now, this yogabhrashta sthiti
is the worst thing
that can happen to anyone.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.960
First of all, you don’t get
your yoga.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.760
And if you get your yoga and then jump
to this sort of a condition…

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.080
about which Shri Krishna
has described

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.560
that you go into rakshasa yoni
(demon’s womb).

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.160
Those who come to Sahaja Yoga
must know

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.240
that you have to stick on
to one thing, properly,

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.640
otherwise what is the yoni left?

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.880
If you die without yoga,
maybe you are born again, maybe —

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.800
of course, this life is wasted —

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.840
but if you try such tricks
after coming to Sahaja Yoga

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:55.000
and try to impress on others
that you are a very great realised soul

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.280
or that you have achieved this
and achieved that —

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.560
all this nonsense that you have been
doing before getting to Realisation —

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:06.440
then there is a very serious offence

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.600
and you are punished for that.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:14.520
This is the power of Kalki, which is
secretly working behind Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.960
For example, there was a lady
who came to see Me,

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.200
wanted to publish something
about Me,

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.360
and she was paid
by some horrible fellow.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.240
And she published something nonsensical,
something that I never do.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.160
So everybody was very annoyed and angry
and said, “Mother, You must punish her,

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.440
and we must take her to courts,
You must do defamation, this, that.”

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.360
I said, “I am not going to go to court,
you better go give up these ideas.”

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.240
But nobody would listen, you see.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.320
It so happened that that paper
closed down for three and a half months,

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.080
and they had such a big setback.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.960
Of course, this is not done by Me,
I would say,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.600
as far as Mataji Nirmala Devi
is concerned, but is done by Kalki.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.120
Kalki means
there are eleven powers

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.640
which are guarding
the beauty of Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:01.120
Anybody who tries to play around
with Sahaja Yoga is harmed very badly.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:07.760
So today is a day of telling you
about the dangers

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.320
of playing with the Divine.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.760
So far, people have been taking them
for granted.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.360
They have tortured people like Christ,
they have tortured great saints.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.520
All the time human beings
have been torturing.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.120
And I have been warning
in every lecture practically

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:29.280
that don’t try that trick today,
because Kalki is already on!

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:34.120
And don’t try to trouble anybody who is
a saintly person, who is a good person!

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.680
Be careful about it
because Kalki is on!

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.720
And once this power comes on you,

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.160
you would not know
how to hide yourself!

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.400
Not only those
who are Sahaja yogis,

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.840
but this I am telling
to the whole world today,

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.720
that be careful!

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.120
Do not try to harm others!

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.520
Do not try to take advantage
of others!

00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:00.200
And do not try to show off
your own power!

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.720
Because once this destruction
will start in your life,

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.520
you won’t know how to stop it!

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.200
Once, I went to… I think I have told you
before also this thing

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.320
that I went to Andhra Pradesh,
and there I told people

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:21.360
that “You should not grow any more
of this tambaku, tobacco.”

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.320
And they were very angry with Me
because they thought
this was their living.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.040
They were minting money
and indulging in all kinds of things,

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.800
making too much money
and doing all kinds of papas (sins).

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
I said, “In this world today
you have come

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.880
not for creating more papa
and more karmas on your head

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.680
but to do the cleansing of the papas —
the papaksh talana.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.600
You have not come here to add
to your sins but to cleanse them.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.520
This is the time of cleansing,

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.720
that’s why I am here as Nirmala,
to cleanse it.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.000
While what are you doing
is to add to your papas.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:00.000
What are you going to gain
out of growing this horrible tobacco?”

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.680
But they would not listen to Me;

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.720
and then, in three of My lectures —
it is on the tape, people are saying —

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.280
that I said that “Be careful!

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:13.280
The Kalki in the sea

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.320
will take respite on you!
It will come on you!”

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.680
And you know
what happened in Andhra.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.840
Same with Morvi, I will tell you:

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.720
only last year some people
met Me from Morvi,

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.760
some very big people
from Morvi.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.440
And they all believed
in a horrible “saint”,

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:34.120
who was a horrible fellow
and who has really destroyed

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.760
families after families.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.560
I told them, “Why do you believe
in this man?

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.160
He is taking your attention
to materialistic things.
Why do you believe in him?”

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.920
Every house in Morvi had the picture
of this horrible “saint”.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.640
And when I told them,
they would not listen to Me.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.160
They thought that I was
just warning them

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:54.040
because I was sort of jealous
of that fellow.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.760
And you know what has happened
about Morvi. Is a fact!

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.720
All these things have been said
in the presence of other people,

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.720
so that they have noted it down,
that what has happened,

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.600
in what place,
and how Mataji has said.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:14.000
Before that, also in Delhi once I met
some of these people from Vrindavan,

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.200
and who were telling Me about
the pandas (priests) and this and that,

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:21.120
and I said, “All of you, give up your
professions, horrible people you are!

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.080
What business have you got
to make money in the name of God?”

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.960
And all those pandits and pandas
and all these people

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.680
are horrible parasites
on the society.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.880
“You get out of your jobs,

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.120
or the river Ganges on which
you have been feeding yourself

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.400
will one day ruin you
completely!”

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.080
And when the floods in the river
Yamuna and the Ganges came in,

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.520
I was in London; I saw on the TV
all these pandas running away

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.520
with their khomchas (stalls)
and everything.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.720
Of course, with these horrible people
when you associate,

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:56.640
when you live with them,
you also suffer; the innocent suffer.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.520
Why should you be impressed
by such people?

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.560
That’s the thing
you have to pay for.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.200
When you are impressed,
you are so compromising:

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.480
“After all, doesn’t matter,
we are going there,

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.960
so we must give something
to this fellow also,

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.320
he is a panda, of our forefathers,
sitting down there and begging money,

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.760
sitting before the river Ganges.”

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:20.560
Imagine, the Giver of Love
and the Giver of Joy is flowing there,

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.640
and these people are sitting
with their backs towards the river

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.640
and asking money from you!

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.760
What silly people they are;
such stupid, useless people!

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.240
And you pay them money,
and you think

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:37.040
that you have done a great punya
(good deed) by donating money to them!

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.320
This sort of life
we have been leading,

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:46.720
a compromising [one], not understanding
what is truth, what is not truth.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:50.640
One side is a complete blind faith

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.880
into all this kind of thing
that is going on

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:56.120
in this country and all over the world,
but specially too much in this country.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.160
We are simple innocent people,

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.200
with lot of bhavikta (sentimentality)
within us,

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:07.000
that’s true, but that doesn’t mean
we should be stupid and fools.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:11.640
For example, the other day
at a meeting

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.200
in a place called Awargaon,

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:20.720
I said that these people
in the Vitthala’s mandir (temple),

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.120
called as badave (temple priests),

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:28.720
should be nicely punished for the way
they are ill-treating these saints

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.560
going down there on their feet
for days together,

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.440
and something
must be done to them.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.600
And everybody was a little annoyed
when I said [this],

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.320
because for these poor people

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.760
these badavas —
who are rakshasas incarnate —

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.440
are something great.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.400
They break the heads
of the people

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.840
who walk all the thousands
of miles there.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.840
They break their heads
just like coconuts,

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.320
and all of them have pain
in the head.

00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:00.880
Such cruelty they confer
on these innocent, simple people!

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.040
And do you think
I should support them

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:07.880
when I stand for truth
and for religion and for compassion?

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:12.000
When I said this, some people, you see,
who had some vested interest —

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.760
must be the relations of the badavas
or whatever it is — got angry with Me.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.600
But thank God,
within three months time,

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:21.520
the whole thing had been taken over
by [the] Government.

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.880
It is so common with us

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:28.440
that we see with our open eyes
what is happening,

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.320
[yet] still we will be going on
doing the same thing in the temples.

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:37.160
Even in the name of God,
we are doing sins after sins.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:42.080
We are adding sins to our sins,
and instead of clearing it out

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:46.680
and understanding it
through our developed brain,

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.720
we just go on adding [to] it.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.280
This is what I call the people
who are tamasi (ignorant),

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.320
who do not use your brains;

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.920
they are mulabuddhis
(of rudimentary intellect).

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.560
They just follow somebody

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.720
because there’s some sort
of a hypnotic influence

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.800
or some sort of a charismatic
movement that is on.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.640
In the West you can see
these charismatic people will take

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.720
thousands of rupees from them,
thousands of rupees!

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.840
And they will give them epilepsy,
gangrene;

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:17.800
if not that, madness, lunacy —
all sorts of things.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:22.320
But people, like mad, are running
after all these movements

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.440
and are adding up
to their destruction,

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.680
to their pile of sins
that they have committed,

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:34.200
instead of spending some time
in cleansing their sins.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.040
This time,

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:40.440
what we have got
is a most precious time,

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.280
and one has to be very careful
and alert about oneself.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:48.400
One should not depend
on any other person for help in this

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.320
but should try
to completely consolidate

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:54.560
one’s own being
into the Kingdom of God

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:59.680
and occupy the highest seat
in the Heart of God Almighty.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.640
Because when Kalki will come,

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:05.760
He will slaughter all these people
without any compassion!

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.920
He is devoid
of any compassion!

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.760
There are eleven Rudras in Him,

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:14.680
means there are
eleven destructive powers
absolutely powerfully settled in Him,

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.760
and when I see all that —
because I can see all that —

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:22.400
this emergency grows into Me
and I tell you: beware of it!

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.160
Don’t play fool with it!

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.240
Don’t take it easy
and do not compromise

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.160
with nonsensical people!

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.400
Stick on to the right!

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:38.320
Otherwise, the day is very near
when Kalki is going to come!

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:44.400
The other type of people are [those]
who think no end of their intelligence.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.560
They have denied God.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.920
They say, “Where is God?
There is no God.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.560
We don’t believe in God.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.560
Is all nonsense,
science is everything.”

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.440
What has science done so far?
Let’s see that.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.400
What has science done for us?

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:04.200
Science has done nothing so far,
it has only done all dead work.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.240
It has only made you
ego-oriented.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.400
All the West is ego-oriented,

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.880
they are finding all the methods
of committing sins.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:16.600
How to commit the worst sins,
they are finding methods,

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.040
and there are certain gurus in India
who are also supplying the knowledge

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.600
how to commit even worse
and worse and worse sins,

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:27.960
so they can easily go
with two running jumps to hell.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.680
Whatever is wrong is wrong,
whether it is today, tomorrow,

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.800
or yesterday,
or thousands of years back.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.680
Whatever is wrong for your dharma,
for your sustenance, is wrong!

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.920
The new phrase
is that “What’s wrong in this?

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.440
What’s wrong in that?”

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.480
That question will be answered
by Kalki only.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:53.440
I am just telling you
that it is wrong,

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.760
and it is extremely wrong,

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:59.800
it is against your ascent,
it is against your being.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.880
And then you will not have
any time to repent

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.120
and to ask this question,
“What’s wrong?”

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.560
You will be chopped off.

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.080
That is what
is the Kalki incarnation.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:14.040
He is going to come
on a white horse, as they say.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:20.320
It’s a tremendous thing
that is going to work out!

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:25.320
Every human being
is going to be sorted out,

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.680
and nobody can then claim!

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:32.440
See, everything is being advertised.
Everything is being published.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.480
Even this instrument

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:38.080
that is created by science
we can use for spreading Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:41.080
You know that if I put it
on My chakras,

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.760
you get the vibrations
and you get your Realisation.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:48.000
The whole science is subservient
to Sahaja Yoga!

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.160
Like, the other day
some TV people came

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.520
and they said, “Mother,
we want to have your TV done.”

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.560
I said, “You be careful
before doing it.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.080
I don’t want any publicity.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:59.200
But whatever you do,
do it properly.”

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:03.080
Through TV we can give
Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:07.160
Supposing I am there, on the TV screen;
I can ask people to put their hands,

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.160
and there can be thousands
who can get Realisation,

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:11.600
only seeing on the TV.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:15.600
Is a fact that this is emitting
from My being, is a fact!

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.200
Why should you feel angry
about it?

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.080
Why don’t you come and test it?
Why should you be hurt?

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:26.280
Why your ego should hurt you
if I am like that?

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.200
If you are different,
it doesn’t hurt Me at all.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:33.720
If you know one work
of, say, organising this or that,
I don’t feel bad.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.480
Why should you feel bad
if somebody is a Divine personality?

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.880
Why did you feel bad
that Christ was a Divine personality?

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.520
Why did you murder Him?
Why did you kill Him?

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:48.000
Why did you torture all the people
who were such saintly people?

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.440
You were very wise
and sweet, isn’t it?

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.120
You have been very kind
and nice people,

00:22:54.320 --> 00:23:00.960
running after all kinds of wrong type
of useless, misguiding people.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:07.520
There are so many now
who have come to misguide you.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.040
They are taking money from you
for misguiding you.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.600
They are taking money
for giving you sins.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:20.800
They are nicely booking you up
for a trip to hell,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.400
they themselves are booked
nicely there.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.080
And when I say about them,
people feel very hurt

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.400
that “Why should Mataji talk
against these gurus?”

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.400
They are not gurus,
they are rakshasas!

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.000
Once, Christ stood up and said,

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.720
“These devils and the children of devil
will have to go to hell!”

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:50.720
Then people got after Him;
they said, “Why do you say
such things against them?

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.760
They don’t say anything
against each other.”

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:59.960
Christ said, “The Satan is not going
to speak against his own house.”

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:04.160
They are very friendly
with each other.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:08.760
There is no problem among them.
They are very kind to each other.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.280
Now all the disciples
are being distributed:

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:15.800
“You take such a lot, I take such a lot;
and all of us will go to hell directly!”

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.640
It’s properly organised!

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.760
Like, one train is going first,
then the second train will leave,

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.960
then the third train will leave.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.120
The other side of this kind
of ambitiousness

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:31.000
and the kind of ego-orientation
and money-orientation we have:

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.840
all the time we are busy
with this money!

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:38.240
I call it a bhrama,
call it a hallucination.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:42.840
It’s a big hallucination with you people
that you are running after money.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:48.000
It’s another hallucination
that you are running after pretatmas
(dead spirits) and dead bodies.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:52.480
These are two mirages
you are running after.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.080
What are you going to get
out of this money?

00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:00.880
Go and see somebody who is
supposed to be a very very rich man.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.800
Just go and see:
Is he a happy man?

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.360
What is the analysis
of his life?

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.400
So-called successful people,
you just go and see them,

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.200
what is the success they have?

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.080
Who respects them?
When they turn their back, people say,

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:20.720
“Oh God, whose face have I seen!
Let me go and wash my mouth!”

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.360
Are you auspicious?

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.560
If somebody sees you,
does any good comes out of you,

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.560
some shubha (happiness) happens
to that person?

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.520
Are you kalyanamay (virtuous)?

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.440
Are you mangalmay (auspicious)?

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.200
What sort of a personality
are you?

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:43.400
Just judge yourself; and that judgement
can take place here in Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.840
We had a patient
who came to Sahaja Yoga,

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.280
and he told Me,
“Mother, I’m a young boy,

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:52.000
but I don’t know what has happened to me
that I have become inauspicious.”

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.360
I said, “How do you know?”
He said, “Wherever I go

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.560
there’s a quarrel
between husband and wife;

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.360
something goes wrong
with the children;

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:03.400
the children start crying
and shouting and screaming.

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:07.840
And now I’m hated by everyone;
everybody says, ‘There’s something
wrong with you.’”

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.640
I found out about him
what was the matter.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.680
He got cured.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:16.280
Now he is emitting
beautiful vibrations.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.400
You can have very negative vibrations
going out of you.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.280
You might be doing sins
without your knowledge,

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:26.200
and you would say, “Oh, Mother,
I’m getting all the vibrations,
I’m very good.”

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:31.200
Such people always deceive themselves
and others. Very good at it.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.880
“Oh, nothing wrong with me,
I am in first class condition,

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:39.520
my vibrations are the best!”
and that “I’m doing very well!”

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.800
Who is going to judge you
is your deed.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.600
What good have you done
to others?

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.720
Recently we had a mishap
like that.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:51.040
And I found all those people
who were touched by that gentleman

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.960
had Left Swadhishthana catching,
very badly.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.440
And when I told them
that this was a wrong thing to do,

00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:00.840
is to make this man so important,
they all got after My life.

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:05.840
There was a doctor who had come
to see Me, who is a Sahaja yogi.

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:09.560
His son came to see Me;
he’s eight years old and a very good boy,

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:12.320
had a Realisation,
but he had a very bad Swadhishthana.

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:14.680
So I asked him, “Does this man
come to your house?”

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.520
He says, “Yes, Mother,
he comes very often.”

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:20.560
Despite My warning he would go
to their house and they would entertain
that gentleman.

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.800
Instead of telling him
that “You go to Mother
and get yourself cleared out!”

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.920
You see, they are enticed
and hypnotised by such a person.

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:31.280
I asked him, I said, “Have you got
this man coming to your house?”

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.480
“Yes,” he said.

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:36.360
I said, “All right,
go and beat him with shoes,
as we do in our Sahaja Yoga.”

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.480
And the boy got cleared out.

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.560
Do you want to ruin your family,
your children, everybody

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:45.760
because you’re adhering
to some hypnotic fellow?

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.640
At least have
some consideration for them!

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:53.480
There are many like this.
But in Sahaja Yoga
it is very easy to desert,

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:57.760
and even in London I know
who is going where,
what they are doing.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:01.480
I write to them, I tell them,
“Don’t do it! Just don’t do it,
have nothing to do!”

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:06.160
Immediately you must understand
that our Mother,
who knows these things…

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.480
She knows,
and if She has told us,

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:11.200
it is the thing that is to be done;
not to be argued.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.960
Did you get your vibrations
through arguments?

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:19.080
But still in Sahaja Yoga also
people falter,

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.320
and that’s the worst thing
they will do

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:25.040
because yogabhrashtas
are the most condemned.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:28.240
Where will they go?

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:32.160
I have to warn all the Sahaja yogis
who are here,

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:35.160
because Sahaja Yoga
is the Last Judgement.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.120
Not only that you will be judged

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:40.920
that you are entering
into the Kingdom of God,

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.640
that you become
the citizens of God, is correct,

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:47.560
but apart from that,
that you are capable of being there;

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.200
whether you have
the complete surrendering

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.640
and understanding
of divine laws.

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:56.480
Even if you are belonging to, say, India
and [are] a citizen of India,

00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:00.200
but if you do mistakes
and if you commit criminal laws,

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.400
you will be punished,
even then.

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:05.000
So, even if you become
the citizen of God,

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.960
you have to be very very careful
about it.

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.200
The second thing
I would like to tell you

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:18.000
is about the destroying powers
of Kalki.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.640
Today’s lecture is going to be
very sharp for you

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:24.680
because the incarnation
that you have asked Me to speak on

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:29.160
is a very sharp one,
is the sharpest of all.

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.840
We had, say,
Krishna’s incarnation,

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.880
when He had hanana shakti
(killing power).

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:37.600
He has killed Kamsa (His evil uncle),
He has killed so many rakshasas;

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:43.320
you know [that], as child also,
He has killed Putana…
and so many people.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.520
But He had leela
(playfulness) also.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:51.240
He had love,

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:57.440
and He did give concessions to people,
He forgave people also.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:01.960
But Christ, who is the embodiment
of forgiveness —

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:08.200
forgiveness of Christ
is nothing but is the power
of sustenance within Him —

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.480
if He explodes,

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:14.560
the whole forgiveness
can come on us as a big disaster

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:20.120
if we are not able to understand
the value of His forgiveness.

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.880
He has said very clearly

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:26.320
that “Anything said against me
will be tolerated,

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:29.360
but a word against Holy Ghost
won’t be tolerated!”

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.640
He has clearly said it!

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:37.040
And now you have to understand
that Holy Ghost is Adi Shakti.

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:42.800
One has to understand
that such an incarnation is imminent.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:49.000
And Krishna’s powers are given to Him,
which are only hanana shakti.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:54.200
Brahmadeva’s powers,
which are only hanana shakti,
are given to Him.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.840
Shiva’s powers,
which are just hanana shakti,

00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.520
the part of it which is a Tandava
(dance of annihilation) is given to Him.

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:05.320
Then, Bhairava’s shakti,
which is also…

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:08.800
you know what Bhairava has got
as a symbol of killing,

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.720
is a big sword-like thing.

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.280
And also Ganesha’s parasha (battle-axe);

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:20.360
and also Hanumana’s all navasiddhis
(nine supernatural abilities),
which are going to destroy,

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.560
are given to Him.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:27.080
All Buddha’s forgiveness

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:32.320
and Mahavira’s ahimsa (non-violence)
is going to turn upside down.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:37.160
All these eleven powers
are going to come on top of us

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:41.360
when we will be finished
with Sahaja Yoga,

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:45.400
when we will be
absolutely sorted out;

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.360
and the last killing
will be done by Him.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:49.920
I wish it was just a killing!

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:55.000
It is not going to be ordinary hanana
like even Devi has done.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:58.560
Because Devi has killed
all these rakshasas
thousands of years back,

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:01.880
but they are back in the seat again,
all these rakshasas.

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:05.320
Now, the problem is very different
at the present moment,

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.200
which you should try
to understand.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.520
That, in the olden days,
till the Krishna’s time,

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:15.240
when He says that “Yada yada
hi dharmasya glanirbhawati bharata

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:23.120
… vinashaya cha dushkrutam
paritranaya cha sadhunam” —

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:28.320
these two words you must understand:
to destroy the dushkrutam,

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:33.280
means the cruel people
or the negative forces,

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:36.760
and to save the saints —

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:40.760
“sambhavami yuge yuge,
I am going to come again and again.”

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.360
But the problem
of the Kaliyuga is

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:48.120
that there is no pure and simple person
as a sadhu (virtuous person, saint)

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:49.840
or as a rakshasa.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:53.560
So many rakshasas
have entered into your brains.

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:57.200
You side with so many people
who are wrong,

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.400
who are doing wrong,

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.720
who are doing all kinds of wrong things
in the name of politics,

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.080
in the name of religion,

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:09.480
in the name of progress
and education and all that.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.800
Once you have sided with them,
then they are in your brain,

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.080
they are within you.

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:17.360
And when they are within you,

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:22.000
how to destroy the dushkrutams?
They are within you!

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.800
You may be a good person,
but you may be destroyed

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.560
because of having them
in your heads.

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:30.120
So there is no
hard and fast rule

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:34.960
as to say who is a real negative
and who is a real positive.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.120
Only the Sahaja Yoga
is going to cleanse you

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.600
and make you
absolutely positive,

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:44.400
positively good people
and religious people.

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:47.160
This is the only way
because your ankura (sprout),

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:51.040
when it starts
giving you Realisation,

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.840
you feel your Self;

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:56.040
you feel your Self,
and with that Self

00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:01.600
you know that you are your Self
and not this mirage.

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.360
You start enjoying that Self.

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.120
Once you start enjoying it,
you give up all these things

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:11.960
that make you compromise and make you
a horribly mixed-up person.

00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:14.800
All this confusion
can go away.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.560
So it is essential

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:20.720
that we should take to Sahaja Yoga
in the most dedicated manner

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.360
and redeem ourselves
of our all wrong doings,

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.440
and also others whom we know;

00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:28.760
and this is the only thing
that we can give to our friends,

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:32.080
relations, and all the world
around you.

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:35.400
People invite others for dinners,
have drinks, this, that.

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.320
What do you give them?

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.520
Nothing.

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:45.640
They will give presents on a birthday,
they’ll go round and give garlands

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:48.280
and exchange good wishes
and everything…

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.720
In London,
when there’s a Christmas day,

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.520
the cards pile up
to such an extent

00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:58.160
that no letter can be sent
for ten days before Christmas.

00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.640
And where is Christ?

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:04.040
On the day when Christ is born,
they’ll go in for a champagne.

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.640
Such foolish people!
Even somebody dies,
they’ll go for a champagne.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.880
Champagne is their religion now,

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:14.240
and whisky is their Kundalini.

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:18.040
They cannot understand God.

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.400
How can they
when they have made God

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:24.000
according to their own conception
of falsehood?

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:28.360
As a Mother,
I have to warn you: be careful.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.960
Do not play about
with your Self.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:36.600
Do not go down but come up,
come up, and come up.

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.440
I am here to help you.

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.080
I am here to work for you
day and night;

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.880
that you know
I work very hard for you.

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.120
I’ll spare no efforts

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:50.760
to help you and do everything
that is possible
to make you all right,

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:53.600
to pass this examination
of Last Judgement.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.600
But you have to cooperate
with Me,

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.600
and you have to go
headlong about it

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.640
and devote most of your time
for Sahaja Yoga

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:06.280
and for imbibing all
that is great and noble.

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:08.760
Kalki is a very big subject,

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:11.360
and if you see the Kalki Purana,
it’s such a big book.

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:14.880
Of course, a lot of trash
is also in there.

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:18.360
But “When is the time coming?”
if people say,

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.520
we’ll say
this is a living process.

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.440
When the work
will be finished,

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.560
when we will see
that there’s no more chance

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.920
of having any more people
in this line,

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.000
Kalki will come down.

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.120
Let us see
how many come in.

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:35.680
But there is a limit, also,
of that.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.520
So, I would request you
to go out:

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:43.280
call your friends, call your relations,
call your neighbours, all of them.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:47.160
Tomorrow is the last day
of My programme here of Navaratri,

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:53.360
where we are going to have
a little felicitation from the Mother.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.960
To Me, the greatest
felicitations will be

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:59.560
when in this Bombay
I will find more people realised,

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.760
taking to Sahaja Yoga
seriously.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:06.520
And after coming to Sahaja Yoga,
not to indulge in backbiting

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:10.760
and small petty-mindedness
and getting angry with each other

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:14.480
but being sensible and wise.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:19.480
It is most surprising:
those who are supposed to be
the cream of the nation,

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:25.600
the most sophisticated people,
are so petty-minded and useless!

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:32.560
I have to tell you these things
because of the immediate emergency

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:35.120
that is coming forward
before Me.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:41.320
And I am only praying
that it should not be in Bombay
that it should start.

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.280
Bombay had gone into the verge,
if you remember,

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:48.040
the day when Rajesh Shah
phoned Me

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.440
that “Mother, what about rain?
What about rain? What about rain?”

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:53.120
I wouldn’t answer him,

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:56.320
till he said, “Mother, I know
You are angry with Bombay people,

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.920
but still forgive them,
once again!”

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:02.480
And that is the night
when you started getting all this rain.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:06.040
Next calamity, beware of it!

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:09.520
I have to tell all Bombay people:
every time I come back,

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:12.200
I find this kind of a nonsense
of these Sahaja yogis

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:15.800
getting after one man somewhere
and getting lost.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.960
And the another thing is
that Bombay people
are still most unaware

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.240
of what is going to fall
into them.

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:27.720
Most unaware how they are made
from amoeba to this stage,

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:32.320
what God has done for them,
and what they have to do for God.

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.480
It’s a very very sad affair.

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:37.360
Extremely sad
for the whole of the country

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:41.200
because people try to follow
this Bombay.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:46.480
There are so many people
who would like to follow
an actor and an actress

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:49.120
than to follow God.

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:54.120
This is the trouble
with our superficial temperaments.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:59.040
I have to say that we have tomorrow
a very good programme.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.640
And also,
a book has been written,

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:07.520
“The Advent”
by Grégoire de Kalbermatten,

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:13.040
who is a son of a baron
and a Swiss boy.

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:17.280
And when he came to Me,
I could see clearly that he is a seeker,

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:20.720
though he was a gone case,
he was like a schizophrenic person.

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:25.280
He was absolutely a gone case.
But I could see in him
that there’s a big seeker within him,

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:28.320
and I had to work hard with him
for a year

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:31.200
to bring him round
to his normal senses.

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.840
But when there is not even seeking
within you

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.320
and when you go that astray,

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:39.160
what is going to happen to you,
I don’t know.

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:42.360
So be careful,
be very very careful.

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.360
Today is the day
of warning you,

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:48.320
because you have asked Me
to talk about Kalki.

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:50.480
He is placed on our forehead.

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:56.200
When the Kalki is caught up —
the chakra of Kalki is caught up —

00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:00.160
the whole of murdha (head),
on top, goes out of order.

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:01.840
In the Kundalini awakening,

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.920
we find that the murdha
is all out of order; it doesn’t rise.

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.120
The whole head
becomes a blockade.

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:10.960
Such people do not allow
the Kundalini to rise

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:14.360
above the… we can say,
the Hamsa Chakra.

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:17.200
At the most, they might try
to raise up to Agnya,

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.680
but the Kundalini falls down.

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.400
Of course, one of the reasons,
as I said,

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:25.800
[is] that if you put your forehead
before wrong gurus also, you suffer.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.600
But too much thinking also creates
a problem on the right-hand side here,

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:34.040
and one of the aspects
of Kalki gets spoilt,

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:37.560
and there is an imbalance
is created on this side.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:44.120
The whole forehead,
if it is full of lots of bumps,

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:48.520
then one must know
that the Kalki Chakra is out of order.

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:50.840
If the Kalki Chakra
is out of order,

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:57.640
the person is about to go
into some sort of a very bad calamity;

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:01.080
is a sign of a person
who is going to get it.

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:06.480
When the Kalki Chakra is caught up,
all your fingers start burning.

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:11.760
On the hands and on the palm,
sometimes even in the body,

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:13.600
you get terrible burning.

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:17.280
A person’s Kalki Chakra catching
means he might be down

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:22.400
with a horrible disease
like cancer, maybe leprosy,

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:24.080
maybe any such diseases,

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:28.640
or maybe that he is about to collapse
into some sort of a calamity.

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:31.320
So Kalki Chakra must be kept
all right in balance.

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:35.720
At least there are eleven sub-chakras
of the Kalki Chakra.

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:38.960
And out of them, at least try
to keep some of them alive

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:40.680
so that others can be rescued.

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.800
But if all the chakras
are ruined,

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.440
then it is very difficult
to give you Realisation.

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:52.200
What is the thing one should do
to keep your Kalki all right?

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:56.280
To keep your Kalki all right,
you must have that awe for God.

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.880
If you do not have awe for God,

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.160
if you are not afraid of God,

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:07.120
if you are not afraid
that if you do wrong
He is there with His wrath

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.480
and that He is a wrathful God

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:14.080
and that He is full
of poison for us;

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:18.440
if we try to do anything wrong,
if there is no fear of that —

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:21.440
not that it is to be hidden from Me
or from anybody else

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:24.920
but not… you yourself know
that you are doing wrong —

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:26.520
if you are doing
something wrong

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:29.320
and you know in your hearts of hearts
that “I am doing something wrong,”

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:30.680
please don’t do it!

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.760
Otherwise your Kalki
will go out.

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.680
When you have
that awe for God

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:41.080
and you know that God is All-pervading,
He is All-powerful,

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:46.800
He has powers to raise us
to this state of higher being,

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.080
and also He has power to bestow
all the blessings that He has,

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:53.120
He is the most compassionate God,

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:57.160
or, we can say,
the most compassionate Father
that one can think of —

00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:00.760
but in the same way
He has a wrath.

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:05.120
And that wrath, when it falls upon you,
be very very careful!

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:06.880
As a Mother,
I have to warn you:

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.720
be careful about the wrath
of your Father!

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:14.720
Because if He comes on you
with that wrath, nobody can stop it!

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:16.440
Nobody can stop it,

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:20.840
and the compassion of Mother
also will not be listened to,

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:26.360
because He may say
that “You have spoiled your children
by giving them too much looseness!”

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:31.800
So I have to tell you that please
don’t do anything that is wrong

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.480
and do not make Me
feel bad about it.

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:38.800
Because, for a Mother,
it is very difficult to tell these things.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.520
It’s very hard, for a Mother,

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:45.400
who has a tender heart
and a kind heart for you,
to say all these things.

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:47.760
But I have to request you
that don’t play about,

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:50.360
because your Father
is full of wrath

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:54.240
and He can punish you
if you do anything wrong.

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:57.080
But if you do anything for Him

00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:00.960
or for your own being,
for your Self-Realisation,

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:03.640
you will be placed
in the highest position.

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:05.720
Today you may be
the biggest millionaire,

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:09.720
you may be the richest man,
you may be the greatest political leader,

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:12.720
you may be the prime minister,
and all that nonsense —

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:16.400
in the presence of God,
those who are dear to God

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:18.760
will be placed
at the highest positions,

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:24.960
and not all these worldly things
which look so interesting
and enchanting to you.

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:29.800
The most important thing — where are you
as far as God is concerned.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.080
That relation
you must establish

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:36.240
by first finding out your Self,
your Atma through Sahaja Yoga

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:38.440
and then relating
yourself to that.

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.120
May God bless you all!

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:44.320
Now we’ll have a session of Sahaja Yoga
for you to get corrected,

00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:47.520
and I would like those people
who have not been here before

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.080
to come forward,
to get their Realisation,

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:52.240
and all the Sahaja yogis
to help Me today

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:57.280
because, today being Kalki’s day,
the vibrations have been a bit too much.
