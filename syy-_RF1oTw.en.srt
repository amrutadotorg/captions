1
02:32:27,847 --> 02:32:31,993
… These English young artists

2
02:32:32,194 --> 02:32:37,814
have really rendered it is
so remarkable, beautiful.

3
02:32:38,015 --> 02:32:42,218
My heart is really full of joy.

4
02:32:42,418 --> 02:32:50,220
All these things, if we can really
somehow or other put into the heads

5
02:32:50,421 --> 02:32:57,523
of people who are lost, the ignorance
in which they are just getting drowned,

6
02:32:57,724 --> 02:33:04,681
you just forgive them, forgive them, because
they don’t know what they are doing now.

7
02:33:04,882 --> 02:33:11,449
But I’m sure what he has prophesized

8
02:33:11,650 --> 02:33:14,688
will come true, hundred per cent.

9
02:33:14,889 --> 02:33:19,289
My God bless you, may God bless England.

10
02:33:20,170 --> 02:33:22,820
Tremendous.

11
02:33:44,889 --> 02:33:49,050
We have had a very, very serious sort
of a play

12
02:33:49,251 --> 02:33:54,220
and it’s good, because you see, hundred
years back

13
02:33:54,421 --> 02:33:58,452
how could this great poet see the vision
of today, you see?

14
02:33:58,653 --> 02:34:03,064
Not only that, he has described the house
which will be built

15
02:34:03,265 --> 02:34:10,108
by the Golden Builders. The house was
on Brompton Square,

16
02:34:10,309 --> 02:34:14,715
and he said it’s on a brook. So somehow
we had to open it out

17
02:34:14,916 --> 02:34:17,758
and we went down, we found there was
a brook there.

18
02:34:17,959 --> 02:34:26,066
It was built on the two shores, you can
say, two - [Hindi]

19
02:34:26,267 --> 02:34:28,285
- on the two sides of the brook.

20
02:34:28,486 --> 02:34:34,768
And the whole span was covered with trusses
so long as 80 feet, 90 feet.

21
02:34:34,969 --> 02:34:38,176
So you can imagine, there was a brook
running down below.

22
02:34:38,377 --> 02:34:42,705
All the description of the house,
everything, is absolutely correct.

23
02:34:42,906 --> 02:34:47,153
Then he has also described our first
ashram, Chelsham Road,

24
02:34:47,354 --> 02:34:50,889
where he said will be shattered
by a bomb –

25
02:34:51,090 --> 02:34:55,108
is a fact. There was. Everything that
he’s described,

26
02:34:55,309 --> 02:34:58,030
I mean, he’s such a detailed visionary
he was.

27
02:34:58,231 --> 02:35:03,908
Another is C.S. Lewis, is another great
visionary who has described

28
02:35:04,109 --> 02:35:10,091
our procession in India, into such details
that it’s impossible to believe.

29
02:35:10,292 --> 02:35:15,000
So not that they were only scholarly, but
they really were visionaries,

30
02:35:15,201 --> 02:35:20,453
and it’s not just imagination but is
the imagination

31
02:35:20,654 --> 02:35:29,668
which enters through the Divine power.
And then it reaches to Reality, so clearly.

32
02:35:29,876 --> 02:35:33,356
I don’t know how much these people
have worked hard for us,

33
02:35:33,557 --> 02:35:38,898
how much they have done for us. Even
as we have Namadeva, who has sung that:

34
02:35:39,099 --> 02:35:46,948
“Oh Mother, give me my Yoga”, all of them
have talked about this, sung about it.

35
02:35:47,149 --> 02:35:50,630
But somehow or other, in the Kali Yuga,
people have gone

36
02:35:50,831 --> 02:35:53,520
into darkness, into ignorance.
So forgive them.

37
02:35:53,721 --> 02:35:56,947
And I’m sure many will come out of it,
I’m very sure,

38
02:35:57,148 --> 02:36:00,174
and their visions were absolutely
correct

39
02:36:00,375 --> 02:36:04,311
and all those visions will be completely
fulfilled.

40
02:36:04,512 --> 02:36:07,403
May God bless you.
