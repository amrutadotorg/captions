21:48.400 --> 21:51.498
Warren’s words have really moved my heart,

21:51.699 --> 21:59.315
and if England is my heart, England should
also feel moved:

22:01.669 --> 22:06.159
that’s the spirit of Shri Ganesha.

22:09.163 --> 22:18.958
And I must say that I have seen so many
things in Warren,

22:20.482 --> 22:23.093
which are very heartening.

22:23.294 --> 22:25.524
Whenever I have felt desperate about
things, you see,

22:25.725 --> 22:36.492
seeing him I felt I must do something more,

22:41.697 --> 22:46.410
because he really loves me very much,
I have seen that,

22:51.920 --> 22:55.208
with complete selfless dedication.

22:55.409 --> 23:09.169
But ‘dedication’ is a word which doesn’t
have that beauty of love.

23:09.370 --> 23:14.023
I mean, if I’m sitting down he’ll
immediately worry

23:14.224 --> 23:20.465
if I have got the tea, or if I need some
heating,

23:20.666 --> 23:25.806
or little things here and there, and I
watch — I’m surprised.

23:26.314 --> 23:30.691
Like any other Sahaja Yogi he’ll be
jumping up here and there

23:30.892 --> 23:35.276
and finding out things to adjust.

23:36.362 --> 23:44.731
And even if I really once say that,
“Maybe,”

23:46.224 --> 23:51.225
he just doesn’t do it, just doesn’t do it.
He said, “That’s it, settled!”

23:51.426 --> 23:55.812
I have never seen him asking me to give
him time to meet him, never.

23:56.013 --> 24:02.741
Not even once he said, “Mother, I must come
and see you!” nothing, never!

24:03.392 --> 24:12.616
I have not known how much money he spent
all throughout his trip.

24:12.817 --> 24:15.200
I don’t know, really.

24:15.401 --> 24:20.623
And I was wanting somebody to say that,
“Mother, we must pay for his travel!”

24:20.824 --> 24:25.130
because he’s really spent all his money.

24:25.757 --> 24:31.180
And I was happy that David brought this
point to me, I was very happy.

24:37.968 --> 24:42.585
One thing I feel [is] that you cannot ask
for love,

24:42.786 --> 24:46.519
that’s something you cannot do.

24:48.209 --> 24:52.666
It’s a very difficult thing to ask somebody
to love,

24:52.867 --> 24:57.188
but that, I think, is the point one should
see.

24:57.389 --> 25:01.594
When you think of Shri Ganesh,

25:02.201 --> 25:07.269
you just have to know that He loves
the Mother so much

25:07.470 --> 25:15.136
that even a slightest hint, He knows what
I want, He knows.

25:15.337 --> 25:18.775
He knows me too well.

25:23.387 --> 25:30.901
He’s not at all so compassionate as myself,

25:31.102 --> 25:36.511
because He cannot forgive those who try
to insult me, He cannot.

25:36.712 --> 25:42.785
Those who try to cheat me, those who try
to be arrogant or egoistical.

25:42.986 --> 25:47.425
He doesn’t, he doesn’t believe in that,
He cannot.

25:47.626 --> 25:49.758
He wants to punish.

25:49.959 --> 25:54.003
He’s ready to punish, very anxious
to punish such people.

25:54.204 --> 25:59.104
But if I say, “No. Spare him,” He listens
to me.

25:59.305 --> 26:05.961
That’s His quality: He cannot bear anything
against me, cannot bear it!

26:07.438 --> 26:13.669
And left to Him, I think I don’t know how
many Sahaj Yogis would have been there.

26:15.073 --> 26:20.579
Even to say, “No Mother!” itself, He cuts
you out on that point.

26:20.780 --> 26:25.976
But I don’t want that it should happen,
because He doesn’t know

26:26.177 --> 26:35.533
that you are still needing help, and
attention, and tremendous compassion.

26:38.667 --> 26:43.984
But you can only know your Mother through
shraddha, through faith.

26:44.185 --> 26:47.894
And what he says is true. And why this
faith?

26:48.095 --> 26:52.542
I mean you see miracles every day, not
only to him:

26:52.743 --> 26:56.544
such games, such plays, such things going
on;

26:56.745 --> 27:01.305
how I have been able to express myself
slowly.

27:01.506 --> 27:04.777
I don’t want to give you any shocks.

27:04.978 --> 27:15.854
So in a very beautiful manner I have tried
to bring forth the play of the Divine.

27:18.604 --> 27:25.122
But I feel that, even now, people get
into arguments:

27:25.323 --> 27:27.850
if I say, “No, this won’t work out.
That’s not good,”

27:28.051 --> 27:31.417
I have to spend at least four, five hours

27:31.618 --> 27:34.569
going round and round and bringing
the point to the heads of people that,

27:34.770 --> 27:38.822
“No, that’s not good, that won’t help you.”

27:40.203 --> 27:42.587
But once I asked him, “How is it you are
so obedient?”

27:42.788 --> 27:45.887
I mean, whatever I say just he gets a hint,
he’ll agree.

27:46.088 --> 27:50.961
He said, “Mother, I once learned a lesson:
that’s my own marriage.

27:51.162 --> 27:55.188
And You didn’t say no, but You did say
to me that,

27:55.389 --> 27:59.641
‘If it makes you happy.’ You didn’t say,
‘It will make you joyous,’

27:59.842 --> 28:01.174
and I have learned a lesson from that.”

28:01.375 --> 28:05.613
But we don’t learn our lessons is [what]
the point is.

28:07.557 --> 28:13.072
We don’t learn our lessons. We argue:

28:16.501 --> 28:18.755
that comes from ego.

28:18.956 --> 28:23.844
If we have superego we, we make others mad!

28:24.045 --> 28:27.673
Like somebody came from America and mean,
he was just mad

28:27.873 --> 28:33.261
that he must come and see me. And I’m
so busy, I have no time, you know that.

28:33.462 --> 28:35.754
I have to correct this book, I have
to correct that book.

28:35.955 --> 28:39.036
Now we have to do this Advent, and that
is to be done.

28:39.237 --> 28:45.052
I have to look after my household, and
this and that. I am so busy.

28:46.226 --> 28:49.356
But the person really made them mad, that
he must see me!

28:49.557 --> 28:52.640
Now if you come from America, that doesn’t
mean that you must see me,

28:52.841 --> 28:56.418
because you never took time with me. I am
busy here now.

28:56.619 --> 29:03.473
When I went to America, it’s all right;
which is true.

29:03.674 --> 29:08.126
And we do not realise that what we are
doing [is]

29:08.327 --> 29:11.105
that we don’t love Mother, we don’t love
Her.

29:11.306 --> 29:17.060
We think of our needs, our impressions,
our talking, it’s a fact.

29:17.261 --> 29:22.344
Like somebody I asked, “All right you
speak, you are a good speaker.”

29:22.545 --> 29:24.866
All right, the person starts speaking,

29:25.067 --> 29:29.112
and he becomes egoistical. How can you be?

29:31.858 --> 29:35.214
If you just start giving a good speech, you
become egoistical.

29:35.415 --> 29:37.625
Somebody made good photographs, so I said,
“These are good photographs.”

29:37.826 --> 29:41.076
He becomes egoistical! You cannot praise
anyone in this country —

29:41.277 --> 29:43.870
it’s the worst thing. He says, “Agnya
is clear.”

29:44.071 --> 29:46.710
I don’t know what sort of an Agnya is clear
here!

29:46.911 --> 29:49.204
You cannot praise. I mean I try to be nice.

29:49.405 --> 29:53.925
I say, “Oh, your photographs are very nice.”
Immediately the person becomes egoistical.

29:54.126 --> 29:57.899
You give some work to someone, “All right
you do this work, postering.”

29:58.100 --> 30:00.948
Somebody is doing postering: his ego
goes up!

30:01.149 --> 30:04.037
What is this? Like a balloon?

30:04.238 --> 30:07.600
There’s no depth. There’s no gravity.

30:07.801 --> 30:10.502
Now why? This is the question.

30:10.703 --> 30:14.932
He asked me many a times, “Why it
happens, Mother?”

30:15.162 --> 30:18.946
The reason is — I told them the other day,
I think they have a tape on this;

30:19.147 --> 30:22.277
you can go through that — but a simple
thing is that,

30:22.478 --> 30:28.747
that we have lived a superficial life here.
We are superficial people.

30:28.948 --> 30:34.435
Because the society is such, this machine
has made us like this,

30:34.636 --> 30:37.752
and we have read books. We have
pampered egos.

30:37.953 --> 30:42.698
Our forefathers went and fought in other
countries thinking no end of themselves.

30:42.899 --> 30:47.456
Then we had this war. With the war we
became also nonsensical,

30:47.657 --> 30:51.271
either aggressive, or we have become with
superego. We have bhoots.

30:51.472 --> 30:54.898
We have conditionings. All these things
are there.

30:55.099 --> 30:59.515
We are not our genuine Self, it’s the
point.

30:59.716 --> 31:04.880
So, I think the being that is going to be
enlightened by your Spirit

31:05.081 --> 31:08.363
is covered with ego, and on top of that,

31:08.564 --> 31:12.065
is a sheen of that superficial being that
you have.

31:12.266 --> 31:17.102
So, “Mother says”. All right. “Mother did
this” All right:

31:17.303 --> 31:22.455
nothing goes inside I feel. There’s no
love.

31:24.137 --> 31:28.899
If you are in love with someone, even if
the person is in that vicinity anywhere…

31:29.100 --> 31:31.514
you know Mother is in London, just think,
“Mother is in London.”

31:31.715 --> 31:35.324
Just think! If you love me, just think.

31:35.525 --> 31:39.590
What a happy thought it is:

31:42.214 --> 31:46.751
“She’s in England!” It’s a happy thought.

31:49.541 --> 31:51.763
Think on those lines. But it does not
work out

31:51.964 --> 31:56.420
because that genuine thing that is inside,

31:56.621 --> 32:01.821
is covered with ego or superego, your
bhoots are in between.

32:02.022 --> 32:07.314
So, what happens [is] that you live with
that superficial nonsense.

32:07.515 --> 32:12.787
Nothing goes inside. It’s all that level.

32:13.525 --> 32:15.866
You ask anyone, they’ll say, “I’m
all right.

32:16.066 --> 32:20.590
I’m like this, I’m like that.” [not very
well] Why?

32:21.178 --> 32:24.693
Nothing goes inside, why?

32:24.894 --> 32:27.876
Because, the genuine Self is lost.

32:28.077 --> 32:32.785
What is going to enlighten you? It’s not
your artificial thing.

32:33.602 --> 32:38.572
You know artificial fibre, if you have
artificial fibre,

32:39.132 --> 32:41.975
it doesn’t penetrate anything.

32:42.176 --> 32:46.973
It can penetrate into everything, but
nothing can penetrate into it.

32:47.174 --> 32:53.456
Like that, that artificial thing on us,
and we live with it, all the time.

32:54.377 --> 32:57.841
Now why he said about Maharashtra?
Because Maharashtrians

32:58.042 --> 33:01.941
are not exposed to artificiality, they
don’t know what is artificiality.

33:02.142 --> 33:05.810
People think they are stupid, they are
foolish, they are no good for business,

33:06.011 --> 33:08.156
they are not good for this, they are not
good for that.

33:08.357 --> 33:14.017
But the main thing is that their genuine
being is not covered with any nonsenses:

33:14.218 --> 33:16.760
“I am something!”

33:16.960 --> 33:22.130
I have never seen Warren feeling that way,
and that’s something surprising.

33:22.972 --> 33:25.784
I have never seen him feeling that he’s
important,

33:25.985 --> 33:31.680
that he should be near me, he should be
in my company — never!

33:31.990 --> 33:39.414
Never even I have heard him anywhere
around. I have to call for him.

33:39.615 --> 33:44.067
Unless and until I call him, he’ll never
come before me.

33:44.448 --> 33:49.150
He wants to see if I need him, otherwise
he’s not bothered.

33:51.515 --> 33:58.403
He just feels that I’m around, “Mother
is somewhere.”

33:58.604 --> 34:00.338
Unless and until [I call him]. But if I
tell him,

34:00.539 --> 34:02.084
“Warren, I want…” wherever he may be,

34:02.285 --> 34:04.827
he’ll just rush and come. It’s a very good
example for you.

34:05.028 --> 34:07.131
I am happy there are some examples
of this kind.

34:07.332 --> 34:11.508
There are many others; I am not saying
it’s only Warren.

34:14.157 --> 34:19.189
And then, if you take up any responsibility
in Sahaj Yoga,

34:19.390 --> 34:22.905
then you start thinking you are great,
you are a great Sahaj Yogi:

34:23.106 --> 34:26.053
you have done this, you have put
the postering, you have done this.

34:26.254 --> 34:31.099
This shows the calibre, shows the calibre.

34:33.534 --> 34:40.355
People from absolutely dead conditions
have risen so high,

34:40.556 --> 34:43.579
and while people from quite normal
conditions are nowhere there,

34:43.780 --> 34:47.520
just they are just there, why?
(The) Calibre.

34:47.720 --> 34:50.865
Now everybody has that calibre. What
I am trying to say:

34:51.066 --> 34:53.045
every one of us have the calibre.

34:53.246 --> 35:03.269
But it is not evident in everyone because
the amount of covering they have

35:04.031 --> 35:09.887
Everybody has capacity to love, everyone
has capacity.

35:10.088 --> 35:17.400
But if you have covered yourself completely
with artificiality you cannot love.

35:17.601 --> 35:21.284
Now if you ask me, “Mother, how to love?”
what am I to tell you?

35:21.493 --> 35:28.541
I love you, no doubt. I love all of you.
I love you very much.

35:29.520 --> 35:32.369
I am bothered about you. But what I find
then,

35:32.570 --> 35:37.296
when I am bothered about somebody, that
person starts taking advantage.

35:37.497 --> 35:40.669
I don’t mind [if you] take advantage,
but by taking advantage

35:40.870 --> 35:44.345
that person goes down completely.

35:47.861 --> 35:49.833
If I am bothered about something,

35:50.034 --> 35:55.268
then [that] one immediately starts thinking
they are very important,

35:55.879 --> 35:59.503
that, “Mother is so much bothered about
me!”

36:01.106 --> 36:04.323
Now try to understand that this is
a country

36:04.531 --> 36:09.186
which is my heart, is my heart itself.

36:11.803 --> 36:16.918
And Sahasrara is nothing else but it’s
heart.

36:18.139 --> 36:22.280
Have you noticed how it is nicely managed
already

36:22.481 --> 36:28.930
that, if Kundalini has to break, it has
to break through the heart chakra?

36:29.131 --> 36:34.644
If your heart is not all right, it cannot
break, your Kundalini at Sahasrara.

36:34.845 --> 36:36.774
Have you seen that?

36:36.975 --> 36:46.393
That the Brahmarandhra, the last opening,
is on the heart chakra.

36:49.549 --> 36:52.254
I know everyone very well.

36:52.455 --> 36:56.897
There are people who are mediums with us.
I know that.

36:57.098 --> 37:00.790
But they don’t know they’ll go to Hell.

37:01.115 --> 37:05.301
It’s a very dangerous time you are in —
be careful!

37:05.502 --> 37:09.464
And that makes me feel even worse when
I think that they don’t know

37:09.665 --> 37:20.192
on what horrible times your feet are
dangling.

37:22.398 --> 37:25.189
So don’t play games!

37:25.390 --> 37:31.249
I know English language has its own styles
and things,

37:31.450 --> 37:36.025
English mannerism has its own ways,
methods.

37:36.226 --> 37:39.950
Forget that you are English!

37:43.843 --> 37:46.790
That’s the best way.

37:48.667 --> 37:54.369
English think that, “We are different
people.

37:54.570 --> 37:58.857
We are of the heart you see — great
people!”

37:59.058 --> 38:03.276
In Italy I told one journalist lady who had
come, very good lady.

38:03.477 --> 38:06.606
She said, “Mother, one thing I didn’t like
the sentence you said

38:06.814 --> 38:10.554
that, ‘England is the heart.’ Agh,

38:11.453 --> 38:17.226
how can it be? Horrible?” She couldn’t
believe it.

38:17.427 --> 38:19.226
She said, “Only because You said I
tolerate it,

38:19.427 --> 38:23.319
but anybody else saying it I would not
tolerate!”

38:24.850 --> 38:29.781
So how far we have gone down as English,

38:29.990 --> 38:34.834
you must see the reputation of English
abroad.

38:35.195 --> 38:42.166
And advancement we have made is to reach
the status of punk rocks!

38:44.318 --> 38:47.285
So when there is such a situation in
a country,

38:47.486 --> 38:52.600
how serious we have to be about it.

38:53.463 --> 38:56.945
Because this country is going to save
the world or is going to mar the world,

38:57.146 --> 39:03.460
because it is at the Sahasrara. Where
Mother is to be accepted.

39:03.849 --> 39:08.505
Whether Mother is to be settled and
worshipped and adored.

39:10.584 --> 39:17.012
But do we have that seriousness
of understanding

39:17.213 --> 39:21.511
that we are born at a time when
the responsibility is much more on us?

39:21.712 --> 39:23.884
We don’t realise that we are born
in the heart, means

39:24.085 --> 39:28.906
our responsibility is much, much more
than other people have.

39:31.081 --> 39:36.136
On the contrary, “We are born on the heart,
so we are great people!” — finished!

39:41.229 --> 39:47.609
There are certain things which you follow,
simple things, is going to help you.

39:47.810 --> 39:54.131
The other day I met somebody who had
a nonsensical thing like a Hamsa [catch].

39:54.332 --> 39:57.864
I said, “Hamsa, how can you have? Are
you putting oil everyday?

39:58.065 --> 40:02.918
Are you putting ghee everyday?” He said,
“No!” I said, “Why?

40:04.299 --> 40:08.560
Is a simple thing like that, why don’t you
do everyday?”

40:11.024 --> 40:14.495
“Mother is here. She’ll look after us.”

40:15.780 --> 40:19.914
The responsibility is not felt because
there’s no seriousness about it!

40:20.115 --> 40:23.061
You don’t know!

40:24.218 --> 40:30.799
The job is great, you can do it, you have
the calibre.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.561
Face yourself up, every one of you.

40:33.762 --> 40:37.623
It’s not facing others. face yourself up!

40:39.226 --> 40:41.698
And I find, really I must say Italians,

40:41.899 --> 40:49.167
really I must say what Warren says,
is true, it’s true.

40:52.302 --> 40:55.378
We have Antonio with us in the house,
I see:

40:55.579 --> 41:01.228
He’s very different from all other English
people.

41:03.569 --> 41:08.057
He’s very different. He’s so balanced,
he’s so much there.

41:08.258 --> 41:11.200
Then, then there are some people, funny
people,

41:11.401 --> 41:13.254
I have seen, they have been with us,
so far, so:

41:13.455 --> 41:16.364
They will go and do this course, they will
go to this, that.

41:16.565 --> 41:18.712
It’s nonsense going on all the time!

41:18.913 --> 41:22.120
And one person like that can spoil all
of them.

41:22.321 --> 41:27.086
We have so many stupid people on the
periphery in Sahaj Yoga in England.

41:27.287 --> 41:30.482
We do not have so many numbers anywhere
else on the periphery.

41:30.683 --> 41:36.199
We have tremendous people, as well as some
people who are really horrid.

41:36.400 --> 41:39.791
I was trying to make a black list
everywhere,

41:39.992 --> 41:46.712
and we had the maximum number in
England! Maximum number in England.

41:50.228 --> 41:53.019
Now when I am going and leaving you here,

41:53.220 --> 41:55.333
you see my heart wrenches really sometimes,

41:55.534 --> 42:01.274
because I know you are not yet matured
enough. But why not mature?

42:02.852 --> 42:06.389
Because there’s no seriousness about it.

42:07.927 --> 42:11.959
Then they will come, “We need a leader,
somebody.” Why?

42:12.160 --> 42:14.636
Why do you want somebody to hit you
on your head all the time,

42:14.868 --> 42:20.723
to tell you things like that? With your own
dignity, why not come up?

42:24.105 --> 42:26.771
Now I am going, you all have to work it
out.

42:26.972 --> 42:32.919
So when you go to India, even Indians
say that English are the worst.

42:33.919 --> 42:35.500
There’s the certificate.

42:35.701 --> 42:42.382
And you have to be the best people, better
than even Australians!

42:45.008 --> 42:45.839
That’s so simple.

42:46.040 --> 42:50.006
Because now we are at Sahasrara,
working at Sahasrara.

42:50.207 --> 42:53.653
Do you see? Why I have to say all these
things?

42:53.854 --> 43:00.003
Because you are born, you are born
in this country.

43:02.607 --> 43:06.006
You are the people.

43:06.207 --> 43:09.269
But whatever I say is, “Mother speaks
very well.

43:09.470 --> 43:12.893
Let’s have a tape. All right, very nice
to hear!

43:13.094 --> 43:17.671
It’s a great entertainment you know,
Mother is talking! She talks very well.”

43:17.872 --> 43:20.201
[But] it doesn’t go inside, anything!
It doesn’t go.

43:20.410 --> 43:26.492
It’s like a plastic on top, complete
plastic cover.

43:32.233 --> 43:40.618
So, one has to learn certain things, a few
things are, like Vishuddhi Chakra:

43:40.819 --> 43:44.009
now English don’t talk, but they move
their heads too much.

43:44.210 --> 43:50.800
If they say yes, they’ll go on saying yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

43:51.001 --> 43:55.043
All the time their necks are moving.
I mean they have long necks,

43:55.244 --> 44:01.957
and they must go on moving their necks
all the time. There’s no need.

44:03.139 --> 44:07.654
Why to bend your neck so much?

44:08.503 --> 44:12.467
Even if they say something, “Yes, yes,
yes, yes.”

44:12.668 --> 44:16.173
Like they’ll say, “Today’s programme
went very well.”

44:16.374 --> 44:20.602
“Yes, yes, yes!” Themselves certifying it.

44:20.803 --> 44:25.661
But they don’t see, because they don’t
want to see it,

44:27.117 --> 44:28.852
that’s Vishuddhi Chakra.

44:29.053 --> 44:32.609
You don’t talk, because when you talk,
horrible things come out,

44:32.810 --> 44:36.082
so you’re so afraid of talking that you
just don’t talk.

44:36.283 --> 44:39.679
But talk to yourself on the mirror, talk
to yourself.

44:39.880 --> 44:47.003
See how you can respect, how you can be
kind, how you could be nice.

44:47.204 --> 44:51.000
But no, the practice is more of sarcasm,

44:51.201 --> 44:56.610
more of saying harsh things, horrible
things,

44:57.634 --> 44:59.853
and that’s it.

45:00.054 --> 45:04.912
It should have, I know is a flair, it
should have a beautiful thing.

45:05.113 --> 45:12.770
It should not be serious sermon, no.
But say something sweet and nice.

45:14.671 --> 45:20.516
It’s so evident when I say something sweet.

45:20.717 --> 45:31.493
Like the other day, we were in France,
and I asked Guido,

45:31.694 --> 45:35.567
“You’d better speak in Italian and
somebody should translate you.”

45:35.768 --> 45:38.594
On the way I was just thinking, “Who
will translate Guido,

45:38.795 --> 45:47.729
because somebody who knows French and
Italian well, who will do that?”

45:47.930 --> 45:53.229
And when I entered the hall I saw Ruth,
you see, standing there with her.

45:53.430 --> 45:58.069
I had not seen her. I didn’t know she
was there. She had come all the way.

45:58.270 --> 46:00.595
And all the way she’s run from there,

46:00.796 --> 46:05.648
and now she’s holding in her hand this mic,
and she is holding fort.

46:05.849 --> 46:11.236
You know, my heart became so large,
and I really felt like embracing her.

46:11.439 --> 46:16.609
And the eyes you see, spoke what I felt.

46:16.810 --> 46:19.781
The way she came round you see, she was
there.

46:19.982 --> 46:24.666
I was worried who will translate and there
she was.

46:24.867 --> 46:27.329
You see, I also get help like this,

46:27.530 --> 46:32.224
when people love me I know I get help.

46:32.425 --> 46:36.510
But if they don’t love me there are
obstructions, problems, this, that.

46:36.711 --> 46:42.872
All nonsense -  you get so fed up you don’t
want to see them, sometimes it happens.

46:43.073 --> 46:46.564
But if there is love, you know the whole
communication works through love,

46:46.765 --> 46:50.820
this subtle love. The whole ether has got
this subtler love,

46:51.021 --> 46:54.025
every matter has got this subtler love,
everything has.

46:54.226 --> 46:58.634
And the whole thing goes into waves and
you just get the message.

46:58.835 --> 47:01.485
But if you are not on that reception point

47:01.686 --> 47:07.068
or if you are not there nothing works:
neither you nor me.

47:07.269 --> 47:12.516
It’s a mutual thing. I help you, but you
help me too. What’s me is you.

47:12.717 --> 47:16.897
But you are not at that level because you
are on superficiality.

47:17.098 --> 47:21.546
And because of this superficiality, also,
you are not collective.

47:21.747 --> 47:26.824
But the sense of collectivity is very, very
tricky also, one must understand.

47:27.025 --> 47:32.368
Some people start forming groups and they
think they have been collective.

47:34.678 --> 47:41.680
Forming a group is a sign of most
uncollective behaviour.

47:42.473 --> 47:44.134
But they think, “We have been very
collective,

47:44.335 --> 47:49.220
we have been very nice, you see!”
Very happy people!

47:50.596 --> 47:57.094
So what I have to tell you is that you
[should] understand your responsibility.

47:57.427 --> 48:04.357
You are in the head office, in the head
office.

48:05.904 --> 48:07.699
And the people who are not in the head
office

48:07.900 --> 48:12.093
are doing much, much better than you.

48:13.514 --> 48:17.887
Then the whole office has to collapse.

48:23.739 --> 48:27.530
Suddenly I hear a news that somebody
is fighting with someone.

48:27.731 --> 48:34.977
Again he is gone back to his normal self.
Only in England.

48:36.426 --> 48:42.187
He gets re-possessed. Again he is left out,
again he is re-possessed.

48:42.388 --> 48:47.942
Again he is clearer, again he is
re-possessed.

48:48.640 --> 48:55.271
Because there is no seriousness about it.

48:55.553 --> 49:06.420
The faith that is serious gives you awe.

49:08.744 --> 49:13.604
It gives you a feeling of joy, but there
is awe.

49:13.810 --> 49:19.752
You love that awe, enjoy that awe.

49:21.339 --> 49:27.637
Mother is around. What are we doing?
Where are we?

49:27.838 --> 49:34.711
And that’s the first sign, that’s the first
sign, that you are realising

49:34.934 --> 49:39.480
who is your Mother — first sign is.

49:44.788 --> 49:48.215
It is very easy just to jump into it,

49:48.416 --> 49:52.685
just like your Kundalini awakening,
I can tell you.

49:56.282 --> 49:59.630
And Americans you know are speedy people.

49:59.830 --> 50:06.553
I knew if they start, they have to just
start, that’s the point. I know that.

50:06.754 --> 50:10.606
Americans have to just start, and they’ll
shoot off,

50:10.807 --> 50:13.910
and they shoot off very fast. They have
speed.

50:14.111 --> 50:22.743
If they take the speed you must know
what they are capable of.

50:22.944 --> 50:25.494
There’s another one that’s coming up
very well,

50:25.695 --> 50:30.744
which I must tell you, is Munich. I didn’t
want to go there.

50:30.945 --> 50:36.401
There was a Polish, stupid, woman, she told
me all wrong about Munich people.

50:36.602 --> 50:39.834
So I thought, “If this is the sample, I’d
better not go.”

50:40.035 --> 50:44.759
Then I felt the vibrations: and tremendous
vibrations!

50:44.960 --> 50:49.932
And the seriousness with which they were
hearing me, the intensity,

50:50.133 --> 50:53.716
as if there was a mathematical class
or some sort of a science class

50:53.917 --> 51:00.214
I was talking about, with complete
attention, not even blinking

51:01.015 --> 51:08.998
Absolute absorption of every word I was
saying.

51:09.199 --> 51:11.576
I was amazed at these people.

51:11.782 --> 51:17.288
And once the Germans get to Sahaj Yoga,
God save you all!

51:18.344 --> 51:22.072
I can assure you, you cannot come up
to their levels,

51:22.279 --> 51:24.992
because they have built up themselves
like that.

51:25.193 --> 51:29.616
They are built up people. They are people
of discipline.

51:29.817 --> 51:35.294
And when they will come to Sahaj Yoga
you will see what will happen.

51:35.495 --> 51:42.660
So all this lovey-dovey business, and this
kind of a what you call this,

51:42.861 --> 51:44.521
I don’t know in English word what you call.
Sahaj Yogi: Wishy-washy.

51:44.722 --> 51:47.236
Shri Mataji: Wishy-washy is different.
What I am saying is a person

51:47.437 --> 51:50.386
who is neither here nor there: all the time
bending like this.

51:50.587 --> 51:54.850
Lecha-pecha as we call in Hindi language.

51:56.505 --> 52:01.399
And also telling me, “I am like this!”
All this nonsense!

52:01.621 --> 52:05.623
How many will be left out? I don’t know.

52:06.227 --> 52:13.816
So, if I say anything, just know that
I know what it is.

52:14.850 --> 52:18.280
I know what is going to happen.

52:18.954 --> 52:22.314
But you won’t learn your lessons, I know.

52:22.515 --> 52:28.041
If I told somebody, “Don’t. Go back!”
or, “Stay back!”

52:28.242 --> 52:32.986
that person learns ultimately that, “This
was the thing, correct. Mother said it.”

52:33.187 --> 52:37.652
But how many times? It is the point now.

52:41.628 --> 52:44.664
So now, I am going away.

52:44.865 --> 52:50.799
I want to tell you that we all have to be
serious people.

52:51.000 --> 52:55.233
Whatever mistakes you have committed,
forget it.

52:56.904 --> 53:00.657
Be serious people! Those who are
egoistical, trying to form groups,

53:00.858 --> 53:03.568
are mediums like, they talk like stupid
people,

53:03.769 --> 53:07.626
trying to organise programmes in a stupid
way,

53:07.827 --> 53:13.879
giving big lectures, should come down
to normal now! Nothing doing!

53:15.578 --> 53:20.575
Be serious! We have to be alert.

53:20.776 --> 53:27.394
Those who will sleep now will lose
completely.

53:28.890 --> 53:33.239
I must warn you. It’s important. Time
is short.

53:33.440 --> 53:37.744
You are important people, no doubt
about it.

53:37.945 --> 53:44.801
But if you are no good, you will be losing
your position completely.

53:47.030 --> 53:56.033
The day when I am thinking of going
to India - for a Mother,

53:56.234 --> 54:01.872
she’s more worried about people who are
still not there. She is always worried.

54:02.073 --> 54:04.431
It’s like a boat is going.

54:04.632 --> 54:10.198
I’ve got many people in the boat quite
settled down, even from England.

54:10.399 --> 54:16.343
But there are many still halfway in the
water, you see, coming up, going down.

54:16.544 --> 54:18.429
You are not worried about the people who
are on the boat,

54:18.629 --> 54:23.435
but you are worried about the people
who are still halfway.

54:23.919 --> 54:28.569
And that worry is on my head.

54:29.712 --> 54:34.688
I am serious. The climate is serious.
The weather is serious.

54:34.894 --> 54:39.160
How it rained and rained and rained today!

54:41.782 --> 54:46.000
The whole nature is bothered.

54:47.219 --> 54:53.340
Don’t think that only if you are educated,
uneducated,

54:53.541 --> 54:56.831
you come from this sort of a life or that -
that’s nothing important,

54:57.032 --> 55:00.886
Spirit is above all these things.

55:01.087 --> 55:07.025
But to make the Spirit shine, you see,
to work on your nerves,

55:07.241 --> 55:12.821
that sheen [of superficiality] has to go
away, otherwise it will never work.

55:15.921 --> 55:23.636
Whatever you do, it should please me,
it’s one of the ways. It should please me.

55:28.204 --> 55:31.652
That’s one of the signs. So how do we
do it?

55:31.853 --> 55:37.481
Put me in your heart! Just try to put me
in your heart, it’s very simple.

55:37.682 --> 55:42.695
I am before you now. I am in person.

55:45.330 --> 55:50.999
I was trying to give Realisation to one
of my relations just today.

55:51.200 --> 55:52.930
And I said that, “You don’t close your
eyes.”

55:53.131 --> 55:56.296
He said, “No, I’m not looking at your face

55:56.497 --> 56:01.208
because when I see you, I feel you are
my aunt.

56:01.409 --> 56:06.490
But I am just looking at your feet so that
I shouldn’t feel anymore

56:06.691 --> 56:10.487
that you are my aunt. You are very great.

56:10.688 --> 56:14.774
And your face is the one that puts me
into illusions.”

56:14.975 --> 56:19.386
He could see it’s a Mahamaya. He said,
“Only at your feet I look.

56:19.587 --> 56:24.754
And through your feet only I can get over
this barrier, this feeling.”

56:24.955 --> 56:31.673
In the same way when I am a Mahamaya,
I know I am, I had to be.

56:34.044 --> 56:41.699
But you have to put my feet into your
heart.

56:47.525 --> 56:52.649
Just my feet into your heart.

56:53.342 --> 57:00.508
Because photo, face, everything might be
an illusion.

57:01.725 --> 57:10.447
Might be by seeing my face, you do not get
over your barriers.

57:14.477 --> 57:18.708
To say, “I must see Mother.” “I must
do this.”

57:18.909 --> 57:22.768
“Mother must come to my house.” “She must
have food at my place.”

57:22.969 --> 57:26.056
“She must visit my home.” All this is
so stupid,

57:26.257 --> 57:30.778
I cannot understand what’s the matter
with these people!

57:36.133 --> 57:38.244
Mother, please come in my heart.

57:38.445 --> 57:41.430
Let me clean my heart so that you are
there.

57:41.631 --> 57:45.626
Put your feet into my heart.

57:46.991 --> 57:51.943
Let your feet be worshipped in my heart.

57:52.299 --> 57:56.075
Let me not be in delusion.

57:56.289 --> 57:59.714
Take me away from illusions.

57:59.915 --> 58:02.399
Keep me in reality.

58:02.600 --> 58:07.481
Take away the sheen of superficiality.

58:07.682 --> 58:11.510
Let me enjoy your feet in my heart.

58:11.711 --> 58:16.446
Let me see your feet in my heart.

58:17.192 --> 58:20.284
Only such people.

58:20.871 --> 58:23.888
Even Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha have
done that.

58:24.089 --> 58:27.742
So don’t you think you have to do it?

58:30.160 --> 58:32.876
So humble down yourself!

58:33.077 --> 58:36.852
Humble down yourself in your heart.

58:37.053 --> 58:39.121
Humble down in your heart.

58:39.322 --> 58:43.703
Enjoy your humility. Enjoy your virtues.

58:43.904 --> 58:49.091
The greatest virtue of a Sahaj Yogi
is humility.

58:49.868 --> 58:55.516
Now, so many things you have seen
to convince you.

58:55.717 --> 59:01.102
But in no way it can mean any kind
of subjection,

59:01.303 --> 59:06.594
because what subjection you can give me?
Think of that.

59:07.951 --> 59:14.626
When every subjection is a blessing,
what subjection you are giving me?

59:16.658 --> 59:20.253
Every feeling in the heart is a blessing.

59:20.459 --> 59:29.452
Just now you feel it and you feel the joy,
in your heart.

59:30.230 --> 59:33.758
Then what is your subjection? About what?

59:33.959 --> 59:38.588
I can understand people who are just newly
come, who are good for nothing.

59:38.789 --> 59:41.176
But you are not on the periphery.

59:41.377 --> 59:44.993
But some of them do go into periphery
in no time.

59:45.194 --> 59:49.442
You give them some work — finished!
If I am sweet to someone — finished!

59:49.643 --> 59:53.022
If I see someone — finished! I mean,
this is too much.

59:53.223 --> 59:56.966
I can’t even be nice to you.

01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:11.398
If you do any mistakes or anything, then
you get your left Vishuddhi.

01:00:11.599 --> 01:00:14.354
You’ve done your mistake, all right,
finish it.

01:00:14.555 --> 01:00:17.342
You love me. Maybe there’s something
wrong in the love

01:00:17.543 --> 01:00:19.339
or maybe something has happened,
doesn’t matter.

01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:25.741
“Now, I’m going to be cautious. I’m not
going to make any mistakes.

01:00:25.942 --> 01:00:30.562
How could I do this mistake? Because
I was not fully in love.

01:00:30.763 --> 01:00:33.900
If I had loved something, I would have
not done such a mistake!”

01:00:34.101 --> 01:00:37.982
All right, so develop your love.
No. you will do,

01:00:38.183 --> 01:00:42.609
“I feel guilty because I have done
such a thing.”

01:00:43.999 --> 01:00:48.741
So you miss this and that both. So your
mistake becomes a barrier again.

01:00:48.942 --> 01:00:51.985
Don’t feel guilty about it. We have
to progress further.

01:00:52.186 --> 01:00:54.559
Forget the past. Forget the past. Forget
the past.

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:59.316
We have to go further. We have to be
serious people.

01:01:01.046 --> 01:01:07.174
When we talk, we should talk with that
dignity of that awe.

01:01:10.205 --> 01:01:11.900
That’s very important

01:01:12.101 --> 01:01:17.287
and once you develop that awe your
Ekadasha will disappear.

01:01:19.427 --> 01:01:24.573
Ekadasha will disappear. Just think
of the awe.

01:01:33.479 --> 01:01:41.328
See the silence and the joy, and the joy
of the awe

01:01:41.529 --> 01:01:45.841
is deep, very deep, like a sea.

01:01:46.775 --> 01:01:49.273
(The) sea on superficial level is very
turbulent,

01:01:49.474 --> 01:01:53.800
but inside is silent, absolutely silent.

01:01:54.001 --> 01:02:00.405
Feel that depth. Without awe, you cannot
go down.

01:02:04.489 --> 01:02:11.147
I have sometimes even said little loudly
some things to Warren, I know,

01:02:11.361 --> 01:02:15.864
but it’s never, never felt with him. But
with some people I have never said

01:02:16.065 --> 01:02:20.952
because I know the person won’t take it
from me.

01:02:24.171 --> 01:02:31.168
But he never feels that I have said
anything wrong or to hurt him in any way,

01:02:34.818 --> 01:02:39.302
that’s the sign of complete awe.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.718
And it’s just a wee bit of penetration,

01:02:49.934 --> 01:02:54.624
a very little bit of penetration
[that’s needed].

01:02:54.825 --> 01:03:00.459
Forget the self-importance. Forget the
greatness that you think about yourself.

01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:08.102
When you become the zero then you become
the Mother.

01:03:10.403 --> 01:03:15.609
As long as you are like a cup, you are
small.

01:03:15.810 --> 01:03:20.919
When the boundaries of the cups are broken,
there’s no more a cup.

01:03:23.061 --> 01:03:26.456
And this is what today I have to tell you.

01:03:26.657 --> 01:03:35.315
Today is the eleventh day and ten days,

01:03:35.974 --> 01:03:40.761
out of which nine days were the periods
of fights.

01:03:40.962 --> 01:03:44.758
Tenth day is the period of victory.

01:03:44.959 --> 01:03:49.384
Now eleventh day is of enjoyment.

01:03:49.866 --> 01:03:57.568
But how can the people who do not have
the awe, enjoy? I cannot understand.

01:04:00.253 --> 01:04:07.111
Because Ekadasha forms the barrier.

01:04:07.334 --> 01:04:11.630
And the barrier of Ekadasha, you know
what it is.

01:04:13.091 --> 01:04:21.259
Feel the awe and you’ll go deep into your
heart, deep into your heart.

01:04:21.475 --> 01:04:29.140
Because you are at a point where just you
have to have the gravity to go down.

01:04:30.752 --> 01:04:35.902
[It’s] working out: try to keep that.

01:04:37.425 --> 01:04:41.041
Slowly and slowly you all have come up
to a point;

01:04:41.242 --> 01:04:47.559
only thing is now develop your depth.
Go deep down.

01:04:47.759 --> 01:04:49.988
I know there are frivolous people

01:04:50.189 --> 01:04:54.889
but they’ll all be dropped out in no time.
Don’t worry about them.

01:04:55.089 --> 01:04:57.805
I know what people are doing, how they
are behaving.

01:04:58.006 --> 01:05:04.766
I know every one of you very well,
each one of you.

01:05:07.483 --> 01:05:10.763
So, respect your body, respect yourself,

01:05:10.964 --> 01:05:15.142
keep your hamsas all right at least.

01:05:16.826 --> 01:05:21.488
And I am sure, if you become serious
about it…

01:05:21.689 --> 01:05:26.473
you need a serious understanding of the
whole thing, that’s what is lacking.

01:05:26.674 --> 01:05:29.300
Because if you love someone,

01:05:29.501 --> 01:05:33.915
the whole thing becomes an entire
possession sort of thing,

01:05:34.116 --> 01:05:38.140
the entire being is so seriously involved
into it

01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:43.729
that you cannot afford to miss anything.

01:05:43.935 --> 01:05:48.606
And that’s what is going to help you.

01:05:52.031 --> 01:05:57.767
But seriousness never means you are
not enjoying.

01:05:59.595 --> 01:06:05.541
Enjoyment is so deep: it’s pouring into
the heart.

01:06:05.742 --> 01:06:12.098
I play with you. I always try to say things
that will please you.

01:06:12.299 --> 01:06:15.896
And it should please you much more that
I have said — what today is that —

01:06:16.097 --> 01:06:22.207
how to reach your depths, to reach that
gravity

01:06:22.408 --> 01:06:24.982
that will make you the gurus.

01:06:25.183 --> 01:06:30.030
Today I had to talk to you like a guru,
because I feel

01:06:30.231 --> 01:06:37.961
that now the time has come for all of you
to become gurus of the right type.

01:06:38.162 --> 01:06:47.405
Not with egos or talking big and creating
a big sort of a show out of you.

01:06:47.606 --> 01:06:52.482
But a definite depth within you

01:06:52.683 --> 01:06:57.997
that people see that, “Here is a beacon
of Mother.”

01:07:00.278 --> 01:07:05.756
And it is so fantastic!

01:07:06.204 --> 01:07:11.432
The whole thing is so great, to be that.

01:07:11.647 --> 01:07:15.459
This is what the gurus used to do,
first of all,

01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:20.233
is to cleanse people, clear them out, take
out their barriers,

01:07:20.434 --> 01:07:26.256
make them take out their egos, by hanging
them round, putting them on top of a well,

01:07:26.457 --> 01:07:29.338
putting them down five, six times, dipping
them down.

01:07:29.539 --> 01:07:33.065
They used to do all this for what?

01:07:33.742 --> 01:07:40.369
But now you can do it because I am before
you!

01:07:46.675 --> 01:07:50.291
Because I have come.

01:07:59.941 --> 01:08:05.713
This is the reason. Understand what Warren
has, so rightly, said.

01:08:05.914 --> 01:08:11.566
You might say that “Mother was working
through him.” Maybe.

01:08:12.383 --> 01:08:17.038
But, I always work through you if you are
one with me.

01:08:17.239 --> 01:08:20.933
Even when I am speaking, you are speaking.

01:08:21.134 --> 01:08:27.139
And when you are speaking, I am speaking.
You know that.

01:08:27.956 --> 01:08:35.585
But with all this, that awe is very
important.

01:08:42.226 --> 01:08:49.452
And that gives you the love that thinks:

01:08:51.238 --> 01:08:57.216
complete integration of your heart and
your brain.

01:08:57.417 --> 01:09:02.023
The love that thinks is thoughtful,
the love that thinks.

01:09:02.224 --> 01:09:08.445
And then the third integration: the love
that acts.

01:09:08.896 --> 01:09:16.585
But first this integration must be brought
in: the love that thinks,

01:09:19.438 --> 01:09:26.631
which understands, which feels.

01:09:26.832 --> 01:09:32.377
And then the love that acts.

01:09:35.032 --> 01:09:41.331
But the basic is the love — it starts from
the heart — is the love.

01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:05.343
I think you’d better take my tape today
and listen to it.

01:10:05.544 --> 01:10:11.101
Meditate. Meditate on that.

01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:20.699
I want to see my children in England
develop the depth

01:10:21.588 --> 01:10:31.161
in language, in speech, in feelings,
in expressions, in the personality.

01:10:32.535 --> 01:10:36.975
It’s only the awe that will make it.

01:10:37.176 --> 01:10:41.014
But awe which is not frightening, but awe
that’s joy-giving.

01:10:41.215 --> 01:10:44.445
This is the integration of it.

01:10:44.898 --> 01:10:54.043
Awe that is joy-giving, is not frightening.

01:10:56.401 --> 01:10:58.387
Open your hearts!

01:10:58.588 --> 01:11:03.289
But it doesn’t mean you should be
frivolous, [but] with all the care.

01:11:03.490 --> 01:11:09.182
Have you seen a lotus opening? How
beautifully it opens:

01:11:09.383 --> 01:11:16.373
slowly, every petal so careful not to hit
each other. Slowly it opens out.

01:11:16.574 --> 01:11:24.711
And then the fragrance starts pouring
in the most dignified manner.

01:11:24.925 --> 01:11:32.488
Such a flower only can be offered at the
Lotus feet of the Adi Shakti, isn’t it?

01:11:36.445 --> 01:11:39.614
May God bless you.

01:11:53.231 --> 01:11:56.441
May God bless you.
