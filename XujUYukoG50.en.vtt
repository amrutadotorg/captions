00:00.125 --> 00:02.834
… Her name is Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:03.083 --> 00:04.375
She trained as a doctor in India

00:04.583 --> 00:07.875
and She is now married to a senior diplomat at the United Nations.

00:08.083 --> 00:08.917
She lives in London,

00:09.083 --> 00:11.667
but this week She’s holding a series of public meetings

00:11.875 --> 00:14.000
to publicize Her teachings.

00:14.291 --> 00:17.583
She believes that we all have a form of spiritual energy

00:17.792 --> 00:20.333
called Kundalini at the base of our spines,

00:20.542 --> 00:23.999
which can be awakened and sent flowing through the body.

00:24.166 --> 00:25.583
So I took my shoes off

00:25.792 --> 00:27.750
and went to meet Her in Northampton this morning.

00:27.959 --> 00:30.750
SHRI MATAJI: You are a person who is more active

00:30.959 --> 00:33.959
and tries to think too much, work too much…

00:34.125 --> 00:35.125
REPORTER: I think too much?

00:35.333 --> 00:37.250
Nobody ever said that to me before. Right,...

00:37.500 --> 00:40.125
SHRI MATAJI: And you work too much physically,

00:40.333 --> 00:43.875
you run about and you are more working outside.

00:44.041 --> 00:45.834
And left side is the emotional side,

00:46.000 --> 00:48.375
so left side — for emotional life.

00:48.625 --> 00:51.291
Well, that’s what is the imbalance in you is.

00:51.500 --> 00:54.250
Now for this we have to first give you a balance,

00:54.458 --> 00:58.750
all right? What I'll do is to awaken your frozen side

00:58.959 --> 01:01.250
and bring it down so the grace

01:01.458 --> 01:04.250
comes over here to satisfy this side.

01:04.458 --> 01:08.000
So it is to be awakened, you see, the emotional side is awakened.

01:08.208 --> 01:12.291
And this side is given a sort of a soothing effect

01:12.542 --> 01:14.667
with the all-pervading Power from your right.

01:14.875 --> 01:17.417
So this is, this is how it moves, right? This is the way.

01:17.625 --> 01:20.250
REPORTER: But is this energy and this desire any more

01:20.458 --> 01:22.709
than the desire that everyone has to make the best of himself,

01:22.917 --> 01:24.792
to be happy, to be content?

01:25.000 --> 01:27.667
SHRI MATAJI: You cannot be contented with material things.

01:27.875 --> 01:30.959
You cannot be. That’s the basic principle of economics.

01:31.125 --> 01:32.709
REPORTER: So can I put a contradiction to You,

01:32.917 --> 01:34.959
that in the past when all the gurus

01:35.125 --> 01:36.875
that have achieved fame in the West

01:37.083 --> 01:38.750
have all seemed to be surrounded by a great deal

01:38.959 --> 01:41.667
of very affluent trappings, great deal of wealth and money.

01:41.875 --> 01:43.291
That seemed to be a great contradiciton of

01:43.500 --> 01:44.417
what they’re talking about.

01:44.625 --> 01:46.959
SHRI MATAJI: I’m happy you see that, but how many see that?

01:47.125 --> 01:50.542
Is something one should understand, that it is not a business,

01:50.750 --> 01:52.041
you cannot make money out of …

01:52.250 --> 01:53.959
REP: But they’re making a very successful business out of it.

01:54.125 --> 01:57.917
SHRI MATAJI: Because you are so naive. In
this country people do not use their brains.

01:58.041 --> 01:59.875
You must come to right conclusions,

02:00.041 --> 02:02.208
that if something has to happen to you,

02:02.417 --> 02:03.999
it will be in your awareness.

02:04.166 --> 02:08.375
You have to manifest your powers, and then only you will realize

02:08.583 --> 02:10.750
that you cannot pay money for your evolution.

02:10.959 --> 02:12.834
REPORTER: Now we’ve got perhaps three million people

02:13.000 --> 02:14.083
watching us at the moment.

02:14.291 --> 02:17.166
Should they be able to feel anything or to gain anything

02:17.375 --> 02:18.792
from watching You just on the television?

02:18.999 --> 02:20.166
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, some of them may.

02:20.375 --> 02:22.667
If they are just there, if they put their hands towards Me

02:22.875 --> 02:24.166
just now even like this,

02:24.375 --> 02:26.291
they might feel the cool breeze in their hands.

02:26.500 --> 02:29.458
And then they might feel on their heads coming out the cool breeze.

02:29.667 --> 02:33.875
I mean, it has happened in so many places.
