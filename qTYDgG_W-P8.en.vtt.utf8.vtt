00:14.800 --> 00:21.460
of course I've told you about the brown

00:17.480 --> 00:21.460
now you have become the chicken

00:27.460 --> 00:31.380
making so many eggs everyday

00:34.230 --> 00:41.520
you study something like our birthday we

00:36.630 --> 00:44.629
said when we became a bird out of the

00:41.520 --> 00:47.610
cheese Michelle

00:44.629 --> 00:52.769
so Easter is our birthday we are selling

00:47.610 --> 00:58.739
out of our realization and every day we

00:52.769 --> 01:02.100
must grow with our birthday why in a

00:58.739 --> 01:03.259
human form you decrease your age as your

01:02.100 --> 01:07.759
birthday comes in

01:03.259 --> 01:11.280
but with this we increase your range and

01:07.759 --> 01:14.369
you're proud that you are growing and

01:11.280 --> 01:19.200
the human level you feel unhappy that

01:14.369 --> 01:21.869
you are going here you feel proud that

01:19.200 --> 01:24.660
you are going just the opposite of what

01:21.869 --> 01:30.420
you are doing if you try to do it it

01:24.660 --> 01:32.910
will be nice I mean that doesn't mean

01:30.420 --> 01:36.720
bugging indiscreet you know I am quite

01:32.910 --> 01:41.119
worried on that point discretion is the

01:36.720 --> 01:41.119
first thing that you should have before
