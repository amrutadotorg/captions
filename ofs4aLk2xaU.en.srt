...two persons can come. Any other person with you?

74
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,000
Two is better than three.Two is better than three.

75
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,360
Rub it hard

76
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,080
Rub it hard  rub...rub hard

Rub it hard.

81
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,800
Hard.

82
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,320
He's saying: "Oh Mother Shakti give me...

83
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,920
dedication at Your Lotus Feet."

84
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,280
Now see. Now see your vibrations.

00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:18,800
May God bless you! Now don't think about it. It's just here on top of your head.

87
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,000
He's... as a little hard.

88
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,120
You just say: "Mother, are You the Shakti of Shiva?"

89
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,760
Just ask the question.

90
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,200
Three times.

91
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,880
Aah!

92
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,640
Who else?  Now you and somebody else. Great! All of them are!

93
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,440
Who else is with you ?

94
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,480
Two persons are better.

95
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,720
All of you have been? All the rest have been?

96
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,920
Rub it.

97
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,360

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,920
Ah! Bus [Hindi: "enough"].  Now see.

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,080
Done all of you or there is somebody else left now?

100
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,400
JosÃ© you've washed My Feet sometimes?

101
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,960
He did very well.

102
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,040
Both the hands.

103
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,880
What's he saying?

104
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,000
"We're not allowed to lie and say no..

105
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,000
These lies are allowed.

106
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,880
These are sweet lies.

107
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,080
You felt it, cool breeze?

108
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:56,160
She is from... she is from Como.

109
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:03,160
Yogi: "She is a Sahaja Yogini from Italy." She has washed My Feet?

110
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,480
Yes. She was there at the beginning.

111
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,200
Done, done, here; rub it here a little bit...

112
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,640
Nabhi... Vishudhi

113
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,680
Ha! Now all right. See.

114
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:25,240
The cheeks are becoming like nice reddish stuff, you see.

115
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,680
Very sweet.

116
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,200
May God bless you.

117
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,040
Take this out.Slowly, slowly take this out.

118
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,960
Just slowly.

119
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,080
Slowly, both of you should,because it may fall.

120
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,000
This water is important.

121
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,920
Because you can use it for your gardens and things.

122
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,440
We have to thank Don, because he's the one who came to Spain

123
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,440
and who did the...

124
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,520
May God bless you! May God bless you.

125
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:31,240
Now if you could just bring all these things you know, here

126
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,720
and just you can go on saying the mantra of the

127
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,680
108 names you can't say,  21 names you don't have here anything.

128
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,480
so say the mantras of the 7 chakras that's all.

129
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,160
and I'll wash My Hands with something like that.

130
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,920
Warren you can do that. Seven Chakras. You can start it.

131
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,360
Just keep it here.

132
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,240
I'll tell you one by one; you pour it in My Hand

133
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,400
Little bit of ghee, little one spoon.

134
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,720
Come along, you have to say some mantras of the seven chakras.

135
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:23,520
All right. All of you should say. Make it little slower.

136
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,760
It's a... what you call it? Madhu [= honey]

137
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,400
You got lot of milk in it?

138
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,720
Put more of that.

139
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,480
All of them can come into it.Now put Water.

140
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,400
Dahi [= yoghurt].

141
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,400
You have more dahi?

142
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,240
More dahi there? Yoghurt?

143
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,640
You have more yoghurt?

144
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,440
Don't use, don't use this brass for yoghurt.

145
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,640
Just pour it direct.

146
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,800
Just that..

147
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:14,040
This is also brass.This is also brass, don't worry..

148
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,760
Milk now.

149
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,040
That water,- we put it in there.

150
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,800
We want that pot.

151
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,080
We want that pot that she had brought.
                        So, - put it in there, this one is (?) see,- this is brass.

152
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:03,200
Can I have little bit to wash My Hands? Little water.

00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,640
No, no...

How many there are?

158
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:53,480
"Just three, Shri Mataji." It's all right.

159
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,160
So very lucky, thank you.

160

"It's the ninth day of the moon, Shri Mataji." Yes, very nice day.

173
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,320
Eighth day. Is very good; Ashtami.

174
00:44:55,840 --> 00:45:01,560
It's the best day for the Puja.

I seldom have white, except for the Shiva  Puja.

176

All right? First time the daisy. First time the white.

179
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:34,680
Take it without the blue saree then. Isn't it..

180
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,040
But it looks nice. This combination looks nice.

181
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:42,440
May God bless you!

182
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:54,240
May God bless today all the Spanish SahajaYogis.

183
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:05,320
Let Spain take to Sahaja Yoga very fast and transform themselves.

184
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:18,600
And all those today who have been in the program and yesterday...

185
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:25,160
should all take to Sahaja Yoga seriously and work it out.

186
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:42,240
They must respect their Realization...

187
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,640
and must pay full attention

188
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,200
and importance to their lives.

189
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:06,680
May God bless them all with wisdom.

190
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:16,440
May God bless them all with wisdom. May God bless you all.

191
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,680
You see the Kundalini. You take out your coat otherwise I can't see.

192
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,680
Can you take out his coat? I can't see your [UNCLEAR].
			The light is there.

193
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,320
Ask him also... take out his coat.

194
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:24,840
I want to see your back.

195
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:30,640
Bend down full; bend down full.

196
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:01,800
May God bless you all!

197
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,960
Now the only chakra which  I feel is the right Nabhi.

198
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:08,240
That means you all have little bit of a problem of food.

199
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,480
So look after it. May God bless you!

200
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,840
May God bless you! May God bless you!

201
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:44,120
You look after your livers, -thats important.

202
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:52,200
I think your food here is very oily, I think.

203
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:56,080
Try to reduce fats, you see.

204
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:59,440
It's very oily food you have.

205
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:25,040
Yogi: "There's a gift for you, Mother." What is that?

206
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,120
Thank you.

207
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,400
Fan... aah!

208
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:42,720
I brought two fans when I was coming to Spain I brought two fans.
			I knew it will be hot.

209
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,880
In India we have fans everywhere.

210
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,880
Can you open it?

211
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:00,200
What is that?

212
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,800
Yogi: "This is the bhajans translated into Spanish."

213
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,200
Oh I see! Ah! Good idea.

214
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,720
Yogi: "The book is made by Sahaja Yogis."

215
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,960
This one? Oh beautiful!

216
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:29,240
This is Spanish language?

217
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:39,680
I'll have to learn at least Spanish.

218
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:59,320
"Here are some presents for the Swiss and English." All right.

219
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:15,560
Yogi: "Swiss Brothers."  For Swiss brothers.

220
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:26,200
Now you have brothers and sisters all over the world.

221
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:33,440
This is for English? English Brothers.

222
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:45,240
Oh, I see! This one is good for The Advent.

223
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:53,360
So, you have to go on distributing it to all of them, one each.

224
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,480
Thank you very much.

225
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:07,560
Now you have friends in... brothers and sisters in America...

226
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:14,640
Spain, France,

227
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:19,160
Switzerland, Italy...

228
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:22,480
and now we will be going to Greece also.

229
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,840
in Germany, in Austria

230
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:33,000
and after this program, as you know, after the Paris program

231
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,720
we are going to...

232
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:42,120
first... to

233
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,240
What is the country?

234
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:51,000
Yes to Belgium. But what is the capital?

235
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:55,160
Yogi: "Brussels." Brussels which is the capital of Belgium...

236
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:59,320
and then Holland. In Holland we are going where? Hague or ?
			"Den Haag, Shri Mataji"

237
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,280
We are going to Hague...all right.
			We are going to Hague,

238
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:08,640
and there is going to be seminar.

239
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:12,280
You are going to meet all your brothers and sisters

240
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,040
for this Guru Puja especially.

241
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,400
They all are looking forward.

242
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:20,360
Christine also is coming from America

243
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,800
and I think Danny has come from America...

244
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,320
and I don't know... maybe one or two might come.

245
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:31,520
So you will meet lots of people. May God bless you!

246
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:40,800
Next time I will come for more time to Spain.

247
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,280
Yogi: "Shri Mataji! I just would like to thank all the

248
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,240
Spanish Sahaja Yogis the way they welcome us,

249
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:57,440
it remind us very much India and Indians.

250
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:02,840
How they welcome us with warmth and love and affection.

251
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:07,040
Even if it would have been 1000 miles more...

252
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:12,040
we would have been very happy to meet them. It was very beautiful."

253
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:17,440
You have to learn from them. One has to learn from this.

254
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,560
Yogi: "We have been to the seaside Shri Mataji!

255
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,040
We got sea here in this country, we have got mountains

256
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,120
so to remind them that...

257
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,040
we are still surrounded by mountains in our country,

258
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:09,200
we have a poster for all the Sahaja Yogis just to see that...

259
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:15,920
Shri Mataji is crowned not only by the sea, but by the mountains too."
			Just open it.

260
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:25,880
It's a colour photograph they can give to people, - from you Shri Mataji."
			All of you can have one.  

261
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:26,920
This is the one, - really remarkable, isn't it?

262
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,720
Just My Hand.

263
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:34,120
You might say I was holding a light or something.

264
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:39,960
Very remarkable. It's very remarkable.

265
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:59,880
Slowly, slowly one can expose oneself. Isn't it?

266
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:18,760
And this one is? Yogi:"This is one of your picture too, Shri Mataji."

267
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:24,640
One of My pictures? Yes, for the Spanish Sahaja Yogis.

268
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:51,440
I really look a Spanish.

269
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,960
Distribute that.

270
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:16,280
This one at... in Austria.

271
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:20,160
Somebody gave me this.

272
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:26,480
In Paris, in Paris, sorry.

273
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:34,000
Ya, you gave, he gave, he gave it. I've got it at home.

274
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,840
May God bless you!

275
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:45,600
So now we can have our food and then at tomorrow...

276
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:51,720
"Prasad for Shri Mataji." Prasad I have to eat.

277
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:59,360
You see Gods and Godessess are supposed to just see it; not to eat.

278
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:04,320
Now which one is Spanish in this?

279
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:10,000
Spanish? Really?

280
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:13,120
Looks like Indian.

281
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:19,720
Just like Indian.

282
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,840
What? Yogi: "The brown colour."

283
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:33,040
Spanish cake? What is it called?

284
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:39,440
Yogi: "Made with almonds."

285
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:55,720
So what is all the white things?

286
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:04,680
This one I know. Mr Srivastava likes this. This is very famous.

287
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:10,760
it's a very famous one...

288
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:17,400
What is it called?

289
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:25,200
What is it called in Spanish language? "TurrÃ³n"

290
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,400
Curan?

291
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:44,720
Curan is Curan from Koran?

292
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:53,800
It makes the sound "kur kur" that's why.

293
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:07,840
Thank you very much.
