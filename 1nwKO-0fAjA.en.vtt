AI GENERATED. This is a recording of the speech given by Your Holiness Matai Nirmala Devi

1
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.269
on the 3rd day of the 3-day seminar

2
00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:09.310
held at CJ Hall

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.229
from 19

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.560
March to 21st March 1976.

5
00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:23.930
I thank you very much,

6
00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:24.780
all of you.

7
00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:26.569
My children

8
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.620
For celebrating.

9
00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:31.969
My birthday.

10
00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:34.840
It is such a rare occasion

11
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.069
to see

12
00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:40.200
the children treating the mother so kindly in this alga.

13
00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:44.720
This is the sign

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.919
of the advent of Satyaga.

15
00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:49.119
This is the sign

16
00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:51.799
that people are definitely.

17
00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:55.250
Understanding the value.

18
00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:58.180
of something that is abstract.

19
00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.700
Noble

20
00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:01.509
And supreme

21
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.849
Otherwise,

22
00:01:04.169 --> 00:01:06.730
mother is always taken for granted.

23
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.029
She doesn't ask anything from her children.

24
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.569
She just loves them and looks after their wellbeing.

25
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.449
And all the time what she ask,

26
00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:23.330
is there Kalyan?

27
00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:25.209
Is there salvation?

28
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.690
I was very

29
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.580
happy to see in those 3 days we had our seminar

30
00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:37.099
in this hall

31
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.190
that so many new people have now got realisation.

32
00:01:42.129 --> 00:01:46.360
The vibrations have started flowing from their fingertips.

33
00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:48.040
For the first time,

34
00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:51.279
they have felt that there is something

35
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:52.720
beyond them,

36
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.760
that there is something

37
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.279
that is flowing

38
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.239
through them.

39
00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.779
That they are much more

40
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.300
than what they have been before.

41
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.959
Now we have to know

42
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.879
that

43
00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:11.020
these vibrations are nothing else but is a report,

44
00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:15.050
is a communication with the.

45
00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:17.570
God Almighty.

46
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.740
He has no words,

47
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.380
for human beings have created this language.

48
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.669
These vibrations.

49
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.410
Are telling you something

50
00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:32.369
by which you will know

51
00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:34.929
what he wants you to do.

52
00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:36.690
For example,

53
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.399
when I'm speaking on this mic,

54
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.080
if there is a sound coming,

55
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.960
then the technician knows that this is what is wrong with this mic and he corrects it.

56
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.350
In the same way when the vibrations are flowing from your fingertips.

57
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.929
When you look around,

58
00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.479
when there is a thought coming in you,

59
00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:02.639
when you come in contact with other people.

60
00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:04.380
And

61
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.979
When

62
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.220
you are.

63
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.750
Not being able to decide which is right,

64
00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:12.869
which is wrong.

65
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.479
The vibrations tell you whether it is right or wrong.

66
00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:22.720
You know it very well that in this world of today

67
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.440
there are many

68
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.160
rasas who have come

69
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.039
in the guard of godly people,

70
00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:31.800
but they are not,

71
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.119
and ultimately

72
00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:35.600
the court of law finds them out.

73
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.880
But with vibrations you can find them out

74
00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:40.410
in no time.

75
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.509
Immediately you can find out

76
00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:46.679
which man is real and which is not.

77
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.710
Not only that,

78
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.820
but you can find out the physical problems

79
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.820
of the other person.

80
00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:57.949
You can find out the mental problems of the other person

81
00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:01.910
and also the spiritual problem of the other person.

82
00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:07.000
Because now you have become a member

83
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.779
of

84
00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:10.070
that universal being

85
00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:12.520
that Virawarupa.

86
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.089
Who

87
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.940
is

88
00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:17.899
The microcosm

89
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.510
and you are the microcosm means you are the

90
00:04:21.988 --> 00:04:23.299
part of that body.

91
00:04:23.549 --> 00:04:27.660
You are the cell of that great cell which we call as.

92
00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:31.329
Now how are you to communicate?

93
00:04:31.489 --> 00:04:34.049
It is through the Titania vibration.

94
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.589
These tell you what God wants you to do.

95
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.209
It is

96
00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:45.100
very difficult to remember

97
00:04:45.359 --> 00:04:47.670
that whenever you want to do something,

98
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.790
whenever you want to judge someone,

99
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.910
whenever you want to know what is the will of God,

100
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.829
so many yogis also forget that they must see the vibrations first.

101
00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:02.380
If I'm telling you any lies,

102
00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:04.390
or if anybody is telling you any lies,

103
00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:07.429
immediately you can make it out on your vibrations.

104
00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:08.899
They are so sensitive

105
00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:09.750
and

106
00:05:10.359 --> 00:05:12.119
all the time so very alert,

107
00:05:12.239 --> 00:05:14.559
it's surprising how they act.

108
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.940
It is for the first time.

109
00:05:18.929 --> 00:05:21.369
Such a large number of people have felt them.

110
00:05:22.609 --> 00:05:24.239
Because as I told you before,

111
00:05:24.369 --> 00:05:25.679
it is the blossom time.

112
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.890
But it is the first time

113
00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.369
that a human being can give something to nature.

114
00:05:32.549 --> 00:05:37.619
So far the nature has been providing the human beings with its bounties,

115
00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:42.089
but now it is the human beings who can give something to nature.

116
00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:45.260
I went to Rahuri,

117
00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:47.040
where there is a university,

118
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:48.559
where they are

119
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.320
using these vibrations

120
00:05:50.609 --> 00:05:51.200
for

121
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.600
developing some crops,

122
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.399
and they found out with the vibrated water,

123
00:05:56.609 --> 00:05:59.089
they got 10 times more the crop.

124
00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:02.519
They got beautiful fruits.

125
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.989
The fruits have got such shining lustre on their face

126
00:06:07.359 --> 00:06:09.899
that you can say that yeah they can.

127
00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:16.239
You can see they can't see the lustre on these fruits,

128
00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:18.750
and they are so beautifully tasty.

129
00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:23.320
One papaya was given to me and when I brought it here after 3 days also,

130
00:06:23.359 --> 00:06:26.279
it had not lost its taste nor its lustre.

131
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.970
It's such a fantastic thing that has happened

132
00:06:30.179 --> 00:06:32.769
that you can with your vibrations,

133
00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:35.809
can give it to nature and make the nature

134
00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:38.380
feel the divine within itself.

135
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.790
Now what is

136
00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.070
the scientific thing behind it?

137
00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:47.230
Let us see that.

138
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.649
The scientific behind.

139
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.250
All this is

140
00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:53.160
that

141
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.820
we are not only electromagnetic vibrations.

142
00:06:59.239 --> 00:07:00.739
We are not only

143
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:02.399
dead things,

144
00:07:02.929 --> 00:07:04.829
we are living beings who think,

145
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:06.000
who understand,

146
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:06.690
who plan.

147
00:07:07.739 --> 00:07:09.899
But we are not integrated.

148
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.029
In a dead thing like this,

149
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:14.160
there is.

150
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.910
Only electromagnetic vibrations in the molecules.

151
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:19.700
Then

152
00:07:20.299 --> 00:07:21.649
when it becomes

153
00:07:21.929 --> 00:07:23.230
living there is Prada.

154
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:30.640
Beyond the Prada is the Pradava where there are 7 powers all together in them.

155
00:07:31.369 --> 00:07:34.260
And these 7 basic 7 powers I should say,

156
00:07:34.559 --> 00:07:39.429
because they are actually 21 races to power 1000 powers in.

157
00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:42.790
But I would say basically 7,

158
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.480
which can be subdivided later.

159
00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:49.869
Basically 7 powers in the front of our flow.

160
00:07:50.549 --> 00:07:52.109
And they enrich.

161
00:07:53.049 --> 00:07:56.239
The electromagnetic vibration by synthesis.

162
00:07:58.989 --> 00:08:01.000
The analysis has brought

163
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:08.649
about the electromagnetic vibrations one of the many powers of the Panama.

164
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:10.820
And when

165
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.519
Some of you who are realised,

166
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.209
put your hands towards

167
00:08:15.739 --> 00:08:17.820
anything that is growing.

168
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.130
The synthesis take place and the Prada is

169
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:25.760
increased and that's how you get these beautiful

170
00:08:26.489 --> 00:08:27.040
things

171
00:08:27.369 --> 00:08:29.320
created out of living things.

172
00:08:29.609 --> 00:08:32.799
Even the dead things which we call as dead

173
00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:34.429
can be full of.

174
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:36.010
For example,

175
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:38.690
all our Ganeshas that we have got a,

176
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:40.530
they are all.

177
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.359
Not symbols only,

178
00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:48.260
but they are living gods because though they look like stones through them,

179
00:08:48.309 --> 00:08:49.820
these vibrations are coming.

180
00:08:50.669 --> 00:08:51.599
Now when I say this,

181
00:08:51.659 --> 00:08:52.500
it is better

182
00:08:52.619 --> 00:08:54.460
that you go and find out for yourself,

183
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:55.909
those who are getting vibrations.

184
00:08:57.369 --> 00:09:03.099
I had a problem once when I was talking about Mary that she was the Ahi Shakti herself.

185
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.469
An Indian lady got very angry with me and she said,

186
00:09:06.549 --> 00:09:08.190
what did she do except for crying?

187
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:08.710
And I said,

188
00:09:08.789 --> 00:09:12.659
What did Sita do except for crying and what did Radha do except for crying?

189
00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:16.349
But they are the embodiment of Shakti,

190
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:17.679
and you can see that.

191
00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:18.320
So she said,

192
00:09:18.369 --> 00:09:19.599
How am I to believe it?

193
00:09:19.729 --> 00:09:19.969
I said,

194
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:21.880
you just put your hands and say,

195
00:09:21.929 --> 00:09:24.390
Is Mary divine power?

196
00:09:24.489 --> 00:09:26.080
Is she the divine mother?

197
00:09:26.369 --> 00:09:28.960
And immediately she started getting the vibrations.

198
00:09:29.289 --> 00:09:31.359
The other person who was doubting it

199
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:36.780
told me that he went to this Mattamali temple and he got such a tremendous

200
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:42.460
force of vibrations pouring onto him even when he had not even climbed one step.

201
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:48.559
Our Mahalakshmi temple also is a gift of the nature to you,

202
00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:51.229
which is a vibrated stone is a fact

203
00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.479
which you can go and see for yourself.

204
00:09:53.729 --> 00:09:55.820
But the people who have used it,

205
00:09:56.289 --> 00:10:00.559
the people who are using its powers are making money,

206
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:02.880
are doing all kinds of bad things.

207
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.179
They have no right to be there.

208
00:10:07.489 --> 00:10:11.640
When such people are there at that spot where the vibrations are coming,

209
00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:15.210
there is a cloud of darkness over these big.

210
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:18.549
Great things

211
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.510
that nature has given us,

212
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.500
the Mother Nature has provided us with,

213
00:10:23.789 --> 00:10:25.989
and then we start doubting God.

214
00:10:28.349 --> 00:10:32.159
But the real realised soul in a way is better than those

215
00:10:32.609 --> 00:10:33.159
because

216
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:36.400
he understands he plans he can clear

217
00:10:36.729 --> 00:10:38.450
his vibrations

218
00:10:38.609 --> 00:10:40.929
if there is any cloud covers.

219
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:45.559
Yesterday I gave you the names of all the

220
00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:47.719
chakras that are within our.

221
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:50.510
B

222
00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.380
And the centres that they are controlling

223
00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:57.429
today I would like to tell you

224
00:10:57.979 --> 00:10:59.500
what are the things necessary.

225
00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.760
For a person to keep these chakras alright.

226
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.859
The first chakra is that of Muladhara chakra.

227
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.429
Now Muladara chakra is a chakra,

228
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:12.989
as I told you yesterday,

229
00:11:13.599 --> 00:11:15.159
that of innocence.

230
00:11:15.799 --> 00:11:17.580
Innocence of Sri Ganesh.

231
00:11:17.789 --> 00:11:20.070
He sits there and admits innocence.

232
00:11:20.229 --> 00:11:22.059
Now whether there is Ganesh or not,

233
00:11:22.109 --> 00:11:22.880
he is there.

234
00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.309
Whether you see him or not,

235
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.299
I see him there.

236
00:11:27.559 --> 00:11:28.580
He is there.

237
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.390
He sits there and he.

238
00:11:30.849 --> 00:11:33.539
These vibrations into every human being,

239
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:36.239
but he is not awakened in every human being.

240
00:11:37.619 --> 00:11:39.140
When you disrespect him

241
00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:39.969
by

242
00:11:40.099 --> 00:11:42.380
your wrong behaviour towards sex,

243
00:11:42.539 --> 00:11:43.530
he sleeps off,

244
00:11:43.859 --> 00:11:48.260
or sometimes he gets so annoyed with you that you get tremendous heat in your body.

245
00:11:49.859 --> 00:11:52.409
I have told you how yesterday the Tanrikas

246
00:11:52.799 --> 00:11:53.270
are

247
00:11:53.559 --> 00:11:54.109
trying

248
00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.239
to displease Sri Ganesha to see that a person gets

249
00:11:58.599 --> 00:12:02.150
rid of Sri Ganesh and they use him for his purpose.

250
00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.450
So you have to be an innocent person.

251
00:12:07.619 --> 00:12:10.090
A cunning person is the greatest.

252
00:12:11.489 --> 00:12:13.330
Foolish man ever going round.

253
00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.900
If he thinks by becoming cunning he has earned anything,

254
00:12:16.979 --> 00:12:20.030
he has earned nothing but a real passport to hell.

255
00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:24.330
There is no need for human beings to be cunning.

256
00:12:25.059 --> 00:12:27.960
And this worldly wiseness so called,

257
00:12:28.169 --> 00:12:31.809
has led human beings nowhere in the world.

258
00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:34.080
Let God look after you.

259
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.840
It is he who does everything for you,

260
00:12:37.049 --> 00:12:39.030
and once you know this fact,

261
00:12:39.289 --> 00:12:40.419
you become innocent,

262
00:12:40.609 --> 00:12:42.559
absolutely innocent.

263
00:12:42.809 --> 00:12:45.349
You are most unprotected to look at,

264
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:50.770
but you are the most protected person because Sri Ganesha himself is looking after.

265
00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:53.880
Innocence

266
00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:56.450
is the substratum of your religion.

267
00:12:57.099 --> 00:13:01.039
It is the substratum of every personality.

268
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:05.289
The person who doesn't know what is innocence is a useless fellow.

269
00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:07.219
Absolutely useless.

270
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:08.390
He cheats this man.

271
00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:09.570
He cheats that man.

272
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:11.580
He thinks he has earned a lot of money.

273
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:12.979
He has got a big

274
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:14.580
name in the public.

275
00:13:14.679 --> 00:13:15.500
People think,

276
00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:15.799
no,

277
00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.020
even in the practical sense,

278
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:22.400
you just think of it that no such man is hidden from the public eye.

279
00:13:22.669 --> 00:13:24.270
People know that he is a cheat.

280
00:13:24.469 --> 00:13:26.500
They know that he's a dishonest man.

281
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:29.190
They know that he has been cheating each and every person.

282
00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:30.630
He may cheat for a while here.

283
00:13:30.789 --> 00:13:32.500
He may cheat for a while there,

284
00:13:32.669 --> 00:13:34.510
but I've not met one man.

285
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.020
So far,

286
00:13:36.039 --> 00:13:37.450
who has been a cheat

287
00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.960
and who has carried away with it even in one lifetime.

288
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.229
The cheating

289
00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:47.150
I'm not saying

290
00:13:47.729 --> 00:13:49.369
anything that is political,

291
00:13:49.679 --> 00:13:51.429
but cheating within yourself.

292
00:13:51.559 --> 00:13:53.960
You are all the time cheating yourself.

293
00:13:54.799 --> 00:13:56.640
If you are cheating others,

294
00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.219
nothing is gained,

295
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.549
but actually you are cheating yourself.

296
00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:06.119
You are losing all the chances of your ascendance to the divine,

297
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.039
to the blissful life of a saintly personality.

298
00:14:12.809 --> 00:14:14.429
If you have made laws,

299
00:14:14.549 --> 00:14:18.510
actually it is the idea of keeping human beings

300
00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:22.880
away from that kind of behaviour by which they

301
00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:27.320
not only have a very bad time on this earth but

302
00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.909
also in the later life when they go to hell.

303
00:14:34.359 --> 00:14:35.700
An innocent person.

304
00:14:36.809 --> 00:14:37.520
Maybe be

305
00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:39.289
troubled by others.

306
00:14:40.099 --> 00:14:43.909
People think an innocent person is always troubled by others.

307
00:14:43.919 --> 00:14:44.909
It's a wrong idea.

308
00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.419
You do not know how God helps us.

309
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:56.090
You just watch and see after your realisation that at every step you'll

310
00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:59.940
find there's a help coming from somewhere and how you are helped.

311
00:15:00.309 --> 00:15:03.500
Of course my life is full of such experiences,

312
00:15:03.669 --> 00:15:09.229
but even so many of those who are realised can tell you how God has

313
00:15:09.229 --> 00:15:14.140
been helpful to them and how he has guided their path with his intelligence.

314
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.059
His intelligence is.

315
00:15:16.349 --> 00:15:18.969
The source of all the intelligence of the world,

316
00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:21.210
and when you depend on his intelligence,

317
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:22.330
he guides you,

318
00:15:22.419 --> 00:15:25.669
he looks after you every needs that you have.

319
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:31.119
So the people who say it's no use being innocent,

320
00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:34.820
I have to tell them one thing that you do not understand.

321
00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.039
You are still blind.

322
00:15:37.239 --> 00:15:38.840
You have not yet fell.

323
00:15:39.849 --> 00:15:41.059
That your father

324
00:15:41.799 --> 00:15:43.380
He is such a kind

325
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.739
father.

326
00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:46.500
He's looking after you,

327
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:47.590
and I thus

328
00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:52.640
say there are two types of sins we are committing all the time.

329
00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:57.780
One is a sin against the father when we feel so insecure in life,

330
00:15:58.010 --> 00:15:59.030
whatever you may have,

331
00:15:59.109 --> 00:16:00.260
you feel insecure.

332
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.559
When God has given us such bounties.

333
00:16:04.419 --> 00:16:06.929
Just think of what things he has given us,

334
00:16:07.099 --> 00:16:09.609
how he has made this beautiful earth for you,

335
00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.650
how he has adjusted this earth,

336
00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.010
the way it is going,

337
00:16:13.179 --> 00:16:14.400
the way it is moving,

338
00:16:14.539 --> 00:16:15.929
the way it is flowering,

339
00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:19.130
the way it is giving you all that you need.

340
00:16:19.539 --> 00:16:20.570
It is you,

341
00:16:20.739 --> 00:16:23.409
the human beings have made the misery here.

342
00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:25.369
And

343
00:16:25.619 --> 00:16:29.489
such a God is going to look after you as long as

344
00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:33.369
you depend on Him entirely and believe in Him that oh Lord,

345
00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:34.799
you are our Father,

346
00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:35.690
look after us.

347
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:38.809
Give us this day our daily bread.

348
00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:40.429
This is the sin

349
00:16:40.539 --> 00:16:42.099
we are committing in this country.

350
00:16:43.469 --> 00:16:44.109
In the West,

351
00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:46.000
we are committing another type of

352
00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.309
sin which I call the sin against the mother.

353
00:16:50.799 --> 00:16:53.549
Where we do not understand what is our sustenance,

354
00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:56.239
we do not understand what we have to respect.

355
00:16:57.599 --> 00:17:02.419
What are the things which are sublime in life where we have to respect our chastity.

356
00:17:02.549 --> 00:17:04.348
We have to respect our pavi,

357
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:05.358
the holiness within ourselves.

358
00:17:06.479 --> 00:17:09.439
These are the two types of sins I described them,

359
00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.540
which both

360
00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.118
are managed by Sri Ganesha.

361
00:17:14.469 --> 00:17:16.760
If you could know how to be innocent,

362
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:21.189
you will never commit any sin against God or against the mother.

363
00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.180
Because mother is looking after the innocent being,

364
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.500
she's all the time bothered whenever you remember her,

365
00:17:28.619 --> 00:17:29.699
whenever you think of her,

366
00:17:29.859 --> 00:17:30.689
she is there

367
00:17:30.859 --> 00:17:31.609
to look after her,

368
00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.050
and she gives a promise.

369
00:17:33.339 --> 00:17:33.380
She,

370
00:17:33.619 --> 00:17:34.849
she gives you her protection.

371
00:17:34.969 --> 00:17:36.050
You feel her.

372
00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:40.900
You feel her being around you all the time protected just like her,

373
00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.619
her sari covered the little child.

374
00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.479
Near her heart and she looks after me.

375
00:17:49.359 --> 00:17:50.780
It is a sin

376
00:17:51.069 --> 00:17:56.099
to all the time feel insecure because your father is almighty.

377
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:59.819
He can look after every small thing that you have.

378
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.959
And every big thing that you demand,

379
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:05.719
he is there to look after.

380
00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:09.260
But if you ask him for something that is so,

381
00:18:09.729 --> 00:18:10.790
so useless,

382
00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:14.609
he is a father who has an intelligence who understands.

383
00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:17.260
He is not going to give you something useless.

384
00:18:17.579 --> 00:18:19.880
He is going to give you something eternal.

385
00:18:19.969 --> 00:18:21.510
You ask for the eternal,

386
00:18:21.609 --> 00:18:23.280
and there you'll find you'll find

387
00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:24.849
everything being fulfilled.

388
00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.520
You become yourself the king.

389
00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:31.939
You yourself become the badshah if you can rise

390
00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.859
over this fear of insecurity.

391
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.719
This fear of insecurity is very much in this country.

392
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:45.650
I find every 3rd person suffering from it.

393
00:18:45.979 --> 00:18:46.569
You may

394
00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.369
give them realisation.

395
00:18:48.729 --> 00:18:51.140
Still this problem exists.

396
00:18:51.339 --> 00:18:53.170
Nobody seems to be satisfied.

397
00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:54.839
Nobody has samadhan.

398
00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:56.140
Whatever you have got,

399
00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:57.130
you have no samad.

400
00:18:57.819 --> 00:18:59.390
Now just watch around yourself.

401
00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:00.609
You have got a wife,

402
00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:01.839
you've got children.

403
00:19:01.979 --> 00:19:03.000
You can go out.

404
00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.030
You can play around.

405
00:19:04.219 --> 00:19:05.859
Now why should you not have samada?

406
00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:08.989
I now people will immediately get up and say,

407
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:09.839
what about the poor people?

408
00:19:09.939 --> 00:19:11.589
I'm thinking about you.

409
00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.229
You don't put your attention to something else where you're not going to help.

410
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.000
Actually,

411
00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:18.390
if you become realised,

412
00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.119
you can remove the poverty of this country in no time like that.

413
00:19:23.209 --> 00:19:28.219
Only through realisation you can remove the poverty of this country,

414
00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:29.770
not otherwise.

415
00:19:31.089 --> 00:19:33.079
Because then the bounties of Lakshmi,

416
00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:36.800
which rests on the third chakra as I have told you,

417
00:19:37.089 --> 00:19:38.819
on the third chakra

418
00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:40.119
of Nabi

419
00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:41.199
is awake.

420
00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:44.770
She is awaken.

421
00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:46.430
I have told you about Lakshmi,

422
00:19:46.469 --> 00:19:47.459
how she is,

423
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:49.219
but what should we have

424
00:19:49.469 --> 00:19:50.619
for the temperance?

425
00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.319
What should we have

426
00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:54.390
for this chakra to be all right?

427
00:19:55.119 --> 00:19:58.349
I had said that this chakra is for your sustenance,

428
00:19:58.469 --> 00:19:59.479
for your dharma.

429
00:19:59.709 --> 00:20:01.189
Now what is your dharma?

430
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:05.270
I find a man here who is torturing other people.

431
00:20:06.439 --> 00:20:09.000
He is troubling other people and he wants,

432
00:20:09.189 --> 00:20:09.430
Mother,

433
00:20:09.469 --> 00:20:10.589
my child is very sick.

434
00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:11.790
You must cure him.

435
00:20:11.989 --> 00:20:12.709
Why should I?

436
00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:17.670
What is your bank balance with your God that I should cure that child?

437
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:18.119
Mother,

438
00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.589
you must do good to my child.

439
00:20:19.839 --> 00:20:20.810
Something is wrong with him.

440
00:20:20.959 --> 00:20:21.920
I'm very upset.

441
00:20:22.119 --> 00:20:22.800
This has happened.

442
00:20:22.839 --> 00:20:23.469
That has happened.

443
00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:24.479
Why should I do?

444
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:28.699
Why should God worry about a person who has no dharma,

445
00:20:28.969 --> 00:20:30.540
no love for other children?

446
00:20:31.489 --> 00:20:33.400
Whatever good you do today,

447
00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:35.680
your children are going to reap it and

448
00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:37.280
not only children,

449
00:20:37.489 --> 00:20:38.439
but in future,

450
00:20:38.569 --> 00:20:40.010
the whole world is going to.

451
00:20:40.979 --> 00:20:42.369
Any saintly person,

452
00:20:42.459 --> 00:20:43.890
he may live in the forest.

453
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:44.819
His good deeds,

454
00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:45.810
his good thoughts,

455
00:20:45.819 --> 00:20:49.260
and his good vibrations have always enriched this mother earth,

456
00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.560
and because of that,

457
00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:51.689
she has been able

458
00:20:51.819 --> 00:20:54.979
to bear the heavy weight of the cricket.

459
00:20:57.729 --> 00:21:01.180
The egoistical people who think know of themselves.

460
00:21:02.219 --> 00:21:02.229
They

461
00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:05.089
want their children to be so obedient.

462
00:21:05.609 --> 00:21:06.520
They will smoke.

463
00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:08.290
They will drink before their children.

464
00:21:09.579 --> 00:21:11.449
They will have no dharma of any kind.

465
00:21:12.989 --> 00:21:14.619
No Maria of any kind,

466
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:18.339
and they would expect their children to be the best citizens ever born.

467
00:21:18.569 --> 00:21:20.099
How do you expect that to happen?

468
00:21:23.089 --> 00:21:24.760
For the Nabi chakra,

469
00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:25.810
what you should do today,

470
00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:26.479
somebody asked me,

471
00:21:26.489 --> 00:21:26.890
Matai,

472
00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:28.119
everybody's Nabisco,

473
00:21:28.209 --> 00:21:29.040
what should we do?

474
00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.130
Nabichakra is the most

475
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.800
important chakra in a human being,

476
00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:36.729
and Nabi chakra represents 10.

477
00:21:38.069 --> 00:21:38.810
Pets.

478
00:21:39.119 --> 00:21:41.569
There are 10 subplexuses to the solar

479
00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.949
plexus which is controlled by Navi.

480
00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:48.260
It is

481
00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.900
Given in the Bible,

482
00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:52.380
the 10 Commandments,

483
00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:57.140
that gives a little rough idea as to what should one do as to have

484
00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:59.550
those 10 petals all right.

485
00:22:00.949 --> 00:22:01.890
The dharma

486
00:22:03.469 --> 00:22:04.709
In the stomach

487
00:22:05.339 --> 00:22:07.250
has to be fast balanced.

488
00:22:07.569 --> 00:22:10.729
Once you have a balanced temper and dharma,

489
00:22:10.859 --> 00:22:12.439
then you become dharma teeth.

490
00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:17.420
You go beyond any sustenance where you yourself become sustenance.

491
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.890
You cannot do wrong after that,

492
00:22:20.099 --> 00:22:20.859
but first of all,

493
00:22:20.869 --> 00:22:22.770
your navi chakra is to be settled.

494
00:22:22.979 --> 00:22:24.819
Now how to settle the navi chakra?

495
00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:30.209
Some people have a foolish idea by doing mechanical things you can do Navi.

496
00:22:30.569 --> 00:22:31.729
We have some mad people here,

497
00:22:31.849 --> 00:22:34.130
some surg also all the time doing like this,

498
00:22:34.209 --> 00:22:34.770
doing like that.

499
00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:39.150
They do not understand it is not to be that mechanical.

500
00:22:40.469 --> 00:22:41.540
It is

501
00:22:41.829 --> 00:22:43.229
a living thing.

502
00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:44.790
It is

503
00:22:45.209 --> 00:22:46.839
awareness which understands.

504
00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:48.599
It is

505
00:22:49.349 --> 00:22:50.829
A thing that feels.

506
00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:53.569
And you must know

507
00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:54.469
that

508
00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:55.400
it should,

509
00:22:55.439 --> 00:22:58.530
it can be described as a heart and a brain.

510
00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:01.750
And a mind combined together

511
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.439
exists in the stomach of the man.

512
00:23:06.469 --> 00:23:08.010
Now the food we eat

513
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:09.430
started from there.

514
00:23:10.589 --> 00:23:12.140
When we eat the food,

515
00:23:12.349 --> 00:23:13.390
we must vibrate it.

516
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:14.709
I'm talking for er.

517
00:23:15.349 --> 00:23:17.500
Put your hands for the food.

518
00:23:18.619 --> 00:23:21.459
See that in your family nobody is starving,

519
00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:23.760
that the servants are not starving,

520
00:23:24.079 --> 00:23:25.829
that the cattle is not starving.

521
00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:29.569
See to it that you give something out of your food to others.

522
00:23:31.479 --> 00:23:36.119
I've seen people so insensitive in life that in their own family,

523
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.829
the sister,

524
00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:37.670
if she's a widow,

525
00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:39.099
she doesn't get the food

526
00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:41.939
and the lady is nicely eating her food.

527
00:23:42.109 --> 00:23:42.869
How can she?

528
00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:49.520
The food that you eat has to be vibrated.

529
00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:53.050
Now it doesn't mean by any chance that you

530
00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:55.589
should have certain vitamins and this and that.

531
00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:57.199
It means the food

532
00:23:57.449 --> 00:23:59.719
that you have earned out of your sweat.

533
00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:03.060
It is not the food earned by

534
00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:07.540
troubling others by taking away somebody's rights or something like that,

535
00:24:07.689 --> 00:24:09.050
but your own earnings.

536
00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:11.030
In your own family,

537
00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:12.890
cooked in love by

538
00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:17.650
your own family people or if you have servants who are a member of your family,

539
00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.130
such a food should be.

540
00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.819
But food is not so important.

541
00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:22.319
Again,

542
00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:24.349
the way we make fuss about

543
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.109
food that all our

544
00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:28.770
Religion has gone into kitchen.

545
00:24:29.699 --> 00:24:32.890
There are two types of fusses we have extremes.

546
00:24:33.839 --> 00:24:35.910
One is that people

547
00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:36.890
do not eat,

548
00:24:36.959 --> 00:24:37.709
they fast.

549
00:24:38.839 --> 00:24:40.630
All the time they are fasting.

550
00:24:41.239 --> 00:24:42.920
This is a sin against the mother,

551
00:24:42.959 --> 00:24:43.829
I say.

552
00:24:44.239 --> 00:24:45.400
The way you are fasting,

553
00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.800
the mother feels hurt.

554
00:24:47.719 --> 00:24:48.739
It's a funny thing,

555
00:24:48.949 --> 00:24:51.900
but if I tell you that nobody should fast

556
00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:54.140
when there is any celebration,

557
00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:58.969
but you can fast when there is a thing where you have to feel sorry for it.

558
00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:03.670
While I find people fast at the time when you have to celebrate.

559
00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:09.969
This is a very wrong idea and you are just going opposite the play of the evolution.

560
00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:12.729
That time you have to be happy and

561
00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:13.640
jubilant,

562
00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.160
supposing at the blossom time some trees do not blossom,

563
00:25:18.369 --> 00:25:20.199
then what do we call we call them sick

564
00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:24.930
in the same way we are sick people that we do not catch the time when we

565
00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:30.160
have to be happy and when we have to be unhappy when we have to be fasting.

566
00:25:30.839 --> 00:25:32.459
But when it comes to eating,

567
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:34.819
we are very much eating time.

568
00:25:35.109 --> 00:25:35.469
India,

569
00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:36.020
I think,

570
00:25:36.109 --> 00:25:39.020
is the worst as far as food is concerned.

571
00:25:39.469 --> 00:25:43.569
Morning till evening we are thinking of food and food and food.

572
00:25:43.869 --> 00:25:46.550
We'll talk across what did you have yesterday?

573
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:47.869
What did I have today.

574
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:49.939
We are such eaters,

575
00:25:49.979 --> 00:25:50.619
I tell you,

576
00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:54.400
and such dugers because nowhere in the world you'll

577
00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.680
find people who talk of food so much.

578
00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:02.020
We are so much particular about what we eat as far as the taste is concerned.

579
00:26:04.469 --> 00:26:05.020
Now the

580
00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:08.410
Yup people cannot eat South Indian food.

581
00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:10.410
South Indian people cannot eat Sindhi food.

582
00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:12.650
Sindhi people cannot eat Bengali food,

583
00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:14.400
all kinds of problems,

584
00:26:14.609 --> 00:26:17.689
so much so that we cannot eat one type of fish.

585
00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:19.599
We cannot eat another type of meat.

586
00:26:19.819 --> 00:26:23.989
In a country which is said to be suffering from food shortage,

587
00:26:24.209 --> 00:26:26.130
how can we afford to be so fussy?

588
00:26:26.229 --> 00:26:26.969
No one understands.

589
00:26:27.439 --> 00:26:30.910
It is something funny that nobody understands how

590
00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:33.000
can people be that fussy about food.

591
00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:34.670
They may be having one meal,

592
00:26:34.829 --> 00:26:38.010
but even there they'll be extremely fussy about food.

593
00:26:38.869 --> 00:26:41.900
Such fussy people are no good for vibrations.

594
00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:46.219
They have no good vibrations because all their attention,

595
00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:49.969
their chita is lost in a setting like taste.

596
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:50.989
It is too.

597
00:26:52.199 --> 00:26:53.500
It is useless.

598
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:54.430
Your attention,

599
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.500
which has to reach the divine,

600
00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.270
is lost in all these things.

601
00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:01.800
The second thing

602
00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:06.479
About the food I have told you that you are not to be extremist.

603
00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:09.400
Whatever you get at whatever time you just eat it,

604
00:27:09.569 --> 00:27:10.579
you just forget it.

605
00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.760
Whether you hide it or not makes no difference.

606
00:27:13.319 --> 00:27:14.849
Sometimes I really fast

607
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.050
because I do not do it deliberately,

608
00:27:17.209 --> 00:27:20.260
but automatically sometimes it happens that nobody's in the house.

609
00:27:20.339 --> 00:27:21.729
I just forget about the food.

610
00:27:21.939 --> 00:27:24.569
Then the servant will tell me that you didn't have your breakfast,

611
00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:25.510
didn't have your lunch,

612
00:27:25.619 --> 00:27:26.689
you didn't have your dinner.

613
00:27:26.859 --> 00:27:27.180
I said,

614
00:27:27.199 --> 00:27:27.420
Really?

615
00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:28.329
I didn't know that.

616
00:27:28.459 --> 00:27:28.739
All right,

617
00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.369
I'll have something to eat now,

618
00:27:30.579 --> 00:27:31.170
like that.

619
00:27:31.219 --> 00:27:31.949
It goes on,

620
00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:33.280
but I'm quite hale and heart,

621
00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:33.300
so

622
00:27:33.819 --> 00:27:36.089
so much fuss is made about food

623
00:27:36.579 --> 00:27:37.689
in this country

624
00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.579
is not behooving the wisdom.

625
00:27:41.349 --> 00:27:43.329
And the background we had,

626
00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:46.939
we are the people who are born in the yoga.

627
00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.550
This is a

628
00:27:50.319 --> 00:27:51.550
Saintly country.

629
00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:56.319
Every particle of it is touched by the feet of Sitara who

630
00:27:56.319 --> 00:27:59.880
walk for you without any shoes just to vibrate this country.

631
00:28:00.569 --> 00:28:02.910
This is the kundalini of the whole world.

632
00:28:03.079 --> 00:28:05.910
Here people are not going to waste their energy

633
00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:09.790
and their taste in horrible things like worrying about.

634
00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.630
It's a shameful thing when I see

635
00:28:13.079 --> 00:28:14.719
even the rich and the poor,

636
00:28:14.849 --> 00:28:17.709
all of them so much worried about the taste.

637
00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:20.680
That doesn't mean you should not have any taste.

638
00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:21.680
I'm not saying that.

639
00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:24.199
Of course you all have too much,

640
00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:26.640
so it's better to say that you shouldn't have any taste.

641
00:28:26.849 --> 00:28:27.770
Whatever you may try,

642
00:28:27.839 --> 00:28:29.209
you will still have being Indian.

643
00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:33.880
We can never solve our food problems because of fussy nature.

644
00:28:35.949 --> 00:28:37.239
And we both of it.

645
00:28:43.089 --> 00:28:44.079
We boast of it.

646
00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:44.890
Just think of it.

647
00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:48.030
Why

648
00:28:48.239 --> 00:28:48.479
food?

649
00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:50.109
What is so important about it?

650
00:28:50.209 --> 00:28:51.150
Just a part of it.

651
00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:52.810
Just when you have it,

652
00:28:52.819 --> 00:28:53.489
you can have it,

653
00:28:53.569 --> 00:28:54.290
or if you don't have it,

654
00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:55.170
you don't have it.

655
00:28:55.359 --> 00:28:56.689
It is not so important.

656
00:28:56.859 --> 00:29:01.500
The way we give importance to these useless things spoils our chances of evolution.

657
00:29:04.199 --> 00:29:06.380
Now in the temperance you should come

658
00:29:06.839 --> 00:29:08.619
as far as the religion is concerned,

659
00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:09.229
also,

660
00:29:09.479 --> 00:29:12.199
there are people who are extremists in this country.

661
00:29:13.609 --> 00:29:16.589
We are the greatest product of extremism.

662
00:29:17.439 --> 00:29:18.670
You will see that

663
00:29:18.959 --> 00:29:19.599
here now.

664
00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.469
If I go and talk to Christians,

665
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760
About

666
00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:28.449
the integration of religion which exists within ourselves as a fact,

667
00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:30.369
they'll say you get out from here,

668
00:29:30.739 --> 00:29:33.660
but the Christians in the Western countries will listen to it.

669
00:29:34.849 --> 00:29:37.650
If I talk to the Muslims that you're fanatics,

670
00:29:37.859 --> 00:29:39.329
and this is not religion,

671
00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.609
but religion is that you stop your drinking,

672
00:29:41.739 --> 00:29:43.250
which mama have told you.

673
00:29:43.459 --> 00:29:45.619
Here the Muslims will cut my throat,

674
00:29:45.699 --> 00:29:46.099
I think.

675
00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.140
But in Iran they listen to me for this.

676
00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:50.300
They give up their treaty.

677
00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.219
Everybody's religion seems to be in danger

678
00:29:54.219 --> 00:29:57.329
in this great country of religion itself,

679
00:29:57.819 --> 00:30:00.819
where the religion itself has been established,

680
00:30:00.859 --> 00:30:04.250
the kumba has been established in this beautiful land.

681
00:30:04.979 --> 00:30:07.729
That everybody's religion seems to be in danger.

682
00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:09.170
Some people came to tell me,

683
00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:12.010
what are you going to do about the saving of Hindu religion?

684
00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:12.380
I said,

685
00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:13.719
What is happening to Hindu religion?

686
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:19.339
Out of this fear they have developed sectarism.

687
00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:23.869
Out of this nonsensical ideas of creating caste in birth,

688
00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.109
they have created this problem

689
00:30:26.319 --> 00:30:26.920
within us.

690
00:30:27.079 --> 00:30:28.280
Now let us decide.

691
00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:33.410
That the task is not according to your birth but according to your temperament.

692
00:30:34.689 --> 00:30:36.650
Today only in the morning I have told you

693
00:30:36.829 --> 00:30:37.500
that Yasa,

694
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:39.140
the one who wrote Gita,

695
00:30:39.469 --> 00:30:42.260
was a child of a fisherwoman.

696
00:30:45.349 --> 00:30:47.060
And his father was Parashar Mui.

697
00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:49.040
is a fact,

698
00:30:49.239 --> 00:30:50.640
is a historical fact,

699
00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:55.689
but still we stick on to it saying that we are higher caste and lower caste.

700
00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:56.890
I went to Pune,

701
00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:57.680
and there

702
00:30:57.849 --> 00:30:59.640
they are very Brahmin minded some people.

703
00:30:59.849 --> 00:31:00.089
They said,

704
00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:00.530
Matai,

705
00:31:00.569 --> 00:31:01.479
you are not a Brahmin.

706
00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:02.920
You cannot speak in this hall.

707
00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:03.449
I said,

708
00:31:03.619 --> 00:31:03.770
All right,

709
00:31:03.849 --> 00:31:05.160
let me see who is a Brahmin.

710
00:31:05.329 --> 00:31:08.000
They came before me and they started shaking like this.

711
00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:09.199
I said,

712
00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.079
Why are you shaking?

713
00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:10.599
They said,

714
00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:11.520
because you are a shakti,

715
00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:12.160
we are shaking.

716
00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:14.719
I said if I'm a shakti,

717
00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:15.510
you are shaking.

718
00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.150
There are some people from the madhouse,

719
00:31:17.319 --> 00:31:18.719
they are also shaking the same.

720
00:31:19.119 --> 00:31:23.119
You are mad with the idea of these fanatic things that have gone into your head.

721
00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:27.250
Every human being has got a kundalini.

722
00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:28.609
You must know that.

723
00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:32.020
And once you disrespect anybody under these false.

724
00:31:33.439 --> 00:31:37.189
denominations and these false identifications,

725
00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:41.319
you must know that you are sinning against God by doing that.

726
00:31:41.599 --> 00:31:46.339
So to speak about any religion in that fashion is a sin.

727
00:31:46.599 --> 00:31:49.319
That's what Sai Baba has said again and again.

728
00:31:49.439 --> 00:31:51.180
He was a Muslim when he died,

729
00:31:51.239 --> 00:31:54.449
all of them tortured his life because he was born in a Muslim family,

730
00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:55.390
and when he died,

731
00:31:55.479 --> 00:31:59.040
the same people were born and now doing RT Sai Baba there.

732
00:32:02.569 --> 00:32:05.630
To understand religion in its true manner.

733
00:32:06.449 --> 00:32:09.079
Is this is the dharma yourself?

734
00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:12.839
You understand in its essence what is religion.

735
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:15.939
Sitting before God,

736
00:32:16.189 --> 00:32:19.869
mechanically doing something without feeling anything about.

737
00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:22.670
Create such a problem for you

738
00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:25.770
that to give you realisation is an impossible.

739
00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:30.520
Thank God,

740
00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:31.599
by God's grace,

741
00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:35.089
such great sages have been born in this country like Yoga.

742
00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:37.869
Like the Shankara,

743
00:32:38.689 --> 00:32:40.599
they have written all about it.

744
00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:45.760
They have written that religion comes within yourself spontaneously,

745
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:49.500
and it has nothing to do with all these horrible

746
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:51.369
careers they are doing.

747
00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:54.319
But ask the other people who are following them,

748
00:32:54.729 --> 00:32:57.439
those who have got are talking of.

749
00:32:58.890 --> 00:32:59.489
Cast

750
00:32:59.689 --> 00:33:00.530
by birth.

751
00:33:02.459 --> 00:33:05.979
There cannot be a caste by birth for a Hindu,

752
00:33:06.099 --> 00:33:09.130
at least if you believe in the reincarnation of life.

753
00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:15.459
Because today you are born a Hindu today and maybe you might have been born a Muslim.

754
00:33:15.829 --> 00:33:17.619
I have seen many Muslims

755
00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:18.959
in Iran

756
00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:23.180
doing RT and I've seen many Hindus,

757
00:33:23.229 --> 00:33:24.270
Brahmins.

758
00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:26.670
Doing namas

759
00:33:29.479 --> 00:33:32.099
Extremists are born from one extreme to another.

760
00:33:32.319 --> 00:33:33.869
Here they are born as mullahs,

761
00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.959
and there they are born as the pundits.

762
00:33:36.079 --> 00:33:38.150
They are all against anti-religion.

763
00:33:38.319 --> 00:33:39.859
They can never accept the same.

764
00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.709
They can never accept religion

765
00:33:42.119 --> 00:33:43.989
because they live by

766
00:33:44.319 --> 00:33:45.510
destroying religion.

767
00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.459
Because there

768
00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.530
Petalahotana.

769
00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:55.010
They look after their stomach by destroying your religion.

770
00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:55.579
Sava.

771
00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:58.050
I.

772
00:34:00.369 --> 00:34:04.010
These kind of people have ruined this country,

773
00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:06.040
and they are all sitting in the temples.

774
00:34:06.329 --> 00:34:07.540
I went to this Brindavan

775
00:34:08.449 --> 00:34:09.530
and I was shocked

776
00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:11.219
that all the

777
00:34:11.688 --> 00:34:15.840
rasas who were with Ganza are born there as Pujaris,

778
00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:17.478
and all of them are rasas,

779
00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:18.719
one better than the other,

780
00:34:18.728 --> 00:34:19.060
I.

781
00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:22.188
Terrible rocks are there.

782
00:34:22.309 --> 00:34:23.428
You can feel the vibrations.

783
00:34:23.509 --> 00:34:26.858
You can't stand on those temples even for one minute.

784
00:34:26.947 --> 00:34:28.358
You burn the temple,

785
00:34:28.509 --> 00:34:29.697
the way they are there.

786
00:34:29.908 --> 00:34:31.018
They are the most

787
00:34:31.648 --> 00:34:33.849
hated people at the time of Krishna,

788
00:34:33.947 --> 00:34:38.039
and today they are the people who are looking after the temple of Sri Krishna.

789
00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:39.219
A day will come.

790
00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:43.010
That's why people like Mahamat Ghazni came and destroyed these things,

791
00:34:43.219 --> 00:34:46.899
because you are the people who run after some persons

792
00:34:46.899 --> 00:34:49.688
who are just be fooling you all the time.

793
00:34:49.938 --> 00:34:52.889
So the force of nature comes and destroys it,

794
00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:54.300
and that's how Somnath,

795
00:34:54.379 --> 00:34:55.219
such a great temple,

796
00:34:55.458 --> 00:34:56.060
was destroyed.

797
00:34:57.419 --> 00:34:58.679
It is our doing,

798
00:34:58.689 --> 00:35:01.770
the way we fall at such feet.

799
00:35:02.659 --> 00:35:05.919
Those people who are not to be even kicked by you,

800
00:35:06.129 --> 00:35:10.879
the way we run after them and listen to them in every temple today,

801
00:35:10.969 --> 00:35:13.239
in every masjid and in every church,

802
00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:16.010
we'll find these people in the garden of.

803
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:18.979
I don't say all of them are like that.

804
00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:20.040
I never say that,

805
00:35:20.139 --> 00:35:21.040
but there are many.

806
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:27.379
Now for you to decide when you realised you have got vibrations,

807
00:35:27.489 --> 00:35:28.510
when you go to temple,

808
00:35:28.669 --> 00:35:29.110
first of all,

809
00:35:29.229 --> 00:35:30.879
feel the vibrations of the deity.

810
00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:34.790
Just you are not concerned with anybody else but the deity.

811
00:35:35.699 --> 00:35:38.219
Then you are concerned with the person who is sitting

812
00:35:38.219 --> 00:35:40.689
there and who is putting the tap on you.

813
00:35:40.899 --> 00:35:42.870
You don't allow anybody to touch your.

814
00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:46.820
It's a very important point that everybody is putting here.

815
00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:50.540
From the very beginning when the child is born,

816
00:35:50.669 --> 00:35:54.550
I have seen my own daughter's delivery that the lady who came to

817
00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:58.669
give a bath to the child was working on the Aga very nicely.

818
00:35:58.750 --> 00:35:59.250
I told her,

819
00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:00.939
you dare not touch her head.

820
00:36:02.489 --> 00:36:06.159
When they put their hands on this chakra from the very childhood,

821
00:36:06.409 --> 00:36:08.260
imagine what is the plight of the child.

822
00:36:08.729 --> 00:36:10.120
Then in the temples you go,

823
00:36:10.129 --> 00:36:11.439
in the churches you go,

824
00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:14.409
you take blessings from those people who are unauthorised,

825
00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:16.000
and what they give is nothing

826
00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:17.649
but a devil into you.

827
00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:21.250
So in religion also you have to be alert.

828
00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.139
And for that alertness,

829
00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:26.290
God has given you these vibrations

830
00:36:26.669 --> 00:36:27.590
to use them

831
00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:29.820
wherever you go in every book,

832
00:36:29.909 --> 00:36:30.820
whatever you read,

833
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:32.310
take the essence out of it.

834
00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:35.300
Do not read only because you want to read it,

835
00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:40.550
but to take out the essays by which you get the final and then you.

836
00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:42.459
Tally it.

837
00:36:44.439 --> 00:36:46.790
You must tell it whatever you have known before.

838
00:36:46.899 --> 00:36:48.510
Is it coming true or not?

839
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:52.120
But if you start sitting on the

840
00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:53.310
Uh,

841
00:36:54.489 --> 00:36:57.649
outside of this hall reading Mataji Nirmala Devi's

842
00:36:57.649 --> 00:36:59.959
programme going on and reading the advertisement there

843
00:36:59.959 --> 00:37:02.010
and sitting down there and thinking that you

844
00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:04.639
are attending my programme and also getting realisation

845
00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:05.219
then

846
00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:06.570
how to describe it.

847
00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:09.659
So for religion,

848
00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:12.879
you have to be extremely alert and for that you

849
00:37:12.879 --> 00:37:15.959
have got these vibrations to know what is religion.

850
00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.149
It gives you guidance.

851
00:37:19.399 --> 00:37:20.969
It gives you help.

852
00:37:21.239 --> 00:37:23.070
It gives you moral courage.

853
00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.620
We had somebody with us,

854
00:37:24.719 --> 00:37:27.429
a young boy from a very rigid family,

855
00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:29.449
and in his family there is a custom

856
00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:30.090
that

857
00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.500
they take a newly bride,

858
00:37:33.239 --> 00:37:34.429
newly married bride

859
00:37:34.879 --> 00:37:38.310
to a temple where she has to use a muda,

860
00:37:38.379 --> 00:37:41.080
and in that she has to do that blowing

861
00:37:41.639 --> 00:37:43.199
gari punk as they call it.

862
00:37:44.379 --> 00:37:47.639
He got his realisation and he went very high up.

863
00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:53.449
And he bluntly refused his parents and all the community and told them off that

864
00:37:53.449 --> 00:37:57.000
this is the way you are getting devils in the house and this is possession.

865
00:37:57.250 --> 00:37:58.679
This is not religion.

866
00:37:58.879 --> 00:38:02.050
No goddess is coming into these women who are possessed.

867
00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:04.909
And he was the youngest in the family,

868
00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:06.250
and he stood up and he said,

869
00:38:06.379 --> 00:38:06.500
No,

870
00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:07.300
I will not.

871
00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:10.600
And they had to agree to him because they had

872
00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:13.159
seen those women who were possessed were already suffering.

873
00:38:13.239 --> 00:38:14.159
He brought them to me.

874
00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:15.989
I removed their possessions

875
00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.060
and then

876
00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.189
they saw that they got peace,

877
00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.070
they got health,

878
00:38:20.199 --> 00:38:21.040
and they were better off.

879
00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:24.939
Let us not accept something that is going to ruin us.

880
00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:26.060
It's a simple thing.

881
00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:28.899
We want to accept positions.

882
00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:30.919
Some people,

883
00:38:30.989 --> 00:38:31.500
they just,

884
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:33.469
if you see the business people you'll be shocked.

885
00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:35.439
The other day in Ambernath,

886
00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:36.129
one man,

887
00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:40.090
a disciple of somebody who came to see me with his big photograph here,

888
00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:42.310
and I think he's teaching something about sex.

889
00:38:42.479 --> 00:38:43.739
He came as soon as he saw me,

890
00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:45.239
he went round and round and round.

891
00:38:45.629 --> 00:38:46.020
I don't know,

892
00:38:46.139 --> 00:38:46.750
so fast,

893
00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:48.040
just like a fan,

894
00:38:48.179 --> 00:38:49.169
and he fell on,

895
00:38:49.659 --> 00:38:50.969
and I was shocked.

896
00:38:51.179 --> 00:38:51.679
I said,

897
00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:52.459
Where have you been,

898
00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:53.169
my child?

899
00:38:53.449 --> 00:38:54.219
He was so proud.

900
00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.090
I'm very happy.

901
00:38:55.379 --> 00:38:56.179
I'm all peaceful.

902
00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:56.530
I said,

903
00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:57.770
this is the way you are peaceful.

904
00:38:57.939 --> 00:38:59.489
Just now you're so badly hurt,

905
00:38:59.719 --> 00:39:01.340
but they are so happy with the position.

906
00:39:01.919 --> 00:39:03.830
He just went round and round and round

907
00:39:04.149 --> 00:39:05.379
for about 5 minutes.

908
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:06.070
Just imagine,

909
00:39:06.189 --> 00:39:07.439
and he just fell flat

910
00:39:07.709 --> 00:39:08.300
and he thought,

911
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:08.699
Oh,

912
00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:09.659
he is God.

913
00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:14.270
That is what you have to know in your nabich,

914
00:39:14.679 --> 00:39:16.679
that you are not to get possessed.

915
00:39:18.969 --> 00:39:21.600
The possessions mostly appear on the navi.

916
00:39:22.439 --> 00:39:23.629
And that is the reason

917
00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:27.060
why on the left hand side the Nabiscot is impossible.

918
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.330
It's very difficult to excite.

919
00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:32.169
It is very difficult to take out the position.

920
00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.540
I have to use so many methods to take out the position.

921
00:39:36.459 --> 00:39:38.290
The people do not believe in possessions.

922
00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:43.439
We had a very learned and a very well posted gentleman who came to my programme,

923
00:39:43.689 --> 00:39:45.699
and he started just feeling like that before me.

924
00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:45.969
He said,

925
00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:46.209
Mother,

926
00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:47.489
what is happening to me?

927
00:39:47.729 --> 00:39:47.969
I said,

928
00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:50.610
Will you believe me if I tell you there's a position in you?

929
00:39:50.689 --> 00:39:50.969
He said,

930
00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:52.250
I do not believe in a position.

931
00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:52.489
I said,

932
00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:53.479
you don't believe in it,

933
00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:54.520
but you have it.

934
00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:55.649
You'll have to take it out.

935
00:39:55.729 --> 00:39:57.000
If you do not take it out,

936
00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:58.090
you'll have this problem.

937
00:39:58.209 --> 00:39:58.530
But he says,

938
00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:00.600
I have this problem only with you.

939
00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:00.969
Yes,

940
00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:01.520
of course,

941
00:40:01.699 --> 00:40:04.479
because I can frighten that position in you,

942
00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:05.899
and he's getting frightened.

943
00:40:06.469 --> 00:40:07.919
Then I removed that position,

944
00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:11.639
but he told me that he had a severe pain all the time in the head,

945
00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.679
and now it's gone and finished.

946
00:40:14.409 --> 00:40:17.090
We must decide that we are going to be all right.

947
00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:19.209
We are going to be rid of positions.

948
00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:21.110
We are not going to feel shy of it.

949
00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:21.760
We are

950
00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:24.770
not going to continue with them because we

951
00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:27.010
have some false ideas about our own dignity.

952
00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:31.679
There is no dignity in being dominated by positions.

953
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:37.989
So the navi chakra is very important when you eat your food or when

954
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:43.350
you try to bend before anybody like that or if you have extreme ideas of religion,

955
00:40:43.429 --> 00:40:45.580
if you fast too much or indulge too much,

956
00:40:45.669 --> 00:40:46.639
if you drink.

957
00:40:48.409 --> 00:40:51.709
Then of course Nabichakura is definitely spoiled.

958
00:40:54.179 --> 00:40:55.270
Too much drinking.

959
00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:56.030
It

960
00:40:56.169 --> 00:40:56.600
is

961
00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:57.959
a difficult case,

962
00:40:58.129 --> 00:40:59.760
but if you are slightly drinking,

963
00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.739
you can get realisation and the drinking drops out,

964
00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:04.169
even your smoking drops out.

965
00:41:06.399 --> 00:41:07.340
There is

966
00:41:07.679 --> 00:41:11.020
no prohibition for a person who comes tour,

967
00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:13.080
but after coming to Sergio,

968
00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:14.689
after receiving it,

969
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.919
you must know that drinking is the greatest

970
00:41:16.919 --> 00:41:19.229
foolish thing that man has ever discovered.

971
00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:21.590
Even worse than an atom bomb,

972
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.629
even by atom bomb could be controlled.

973
00:41:24.879 --> 00:41:27.800
But this horrid thing that was discovered,

974
00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:30.350
I don't know how by fermentation or whatever it is,

975
00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:33.110
when it started working into you people,

976
00:41:33.399 --> 00:41:34.790
it has spread like that,

977
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:36.000
like a position.

978
00:41:37.179 --> 00:41:39.209
Like an ugly possession into you,

979
00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:40.810
and once you start smoking,

980
00:41:40.899 --> 00:41:44.060
you go on smoking and you go on drinking.

981
00:41:45.949 --> 00:41:49.709
If the worst habit that man can have is drinking,

982
00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:53.870
but drinking need not be given up before coming to surgery.

983
00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:58.229
Now those who drink will not like it when I tell them

984
00:41:58.229 --> 00:42:01.239
because they think drinking is the greatest bliss in the world.

985
00:42:01.919 --> 00:42:04.310
Even we have written poetry on drinking,

986
00:42:04.479 --> 00:42:06.770
but drinking is against your religion.

987
00:42:06.919 --> 00:42:09.030
It takes you away from your awareness.

988
00:42:09.159 --> 00:42:10.350
I'm telling you the truth,

989
00:42:10.479 --> 00:42:12.080
for that you should not feel bad.

990
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.899
Now we have

991
00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:16.389
Other chakras

992
00:42:16.649 --> 00:42:20.879
here which is I have avoided the second chakra which is known

993
00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:24.399
as the Swaan chakra because it looks after itself.

994
00:42:24.449 --> 00:42:25.600
It's the creativity

995
00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:27.840
and the creativity that flows into you,

996
00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:29.570
the planning that comes to you,

997
00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:32.560
the thinking that comes to you is through this chakra,

998
00:42:32.649 --> 00:42:35.850
and for that chakra you don't have to do much

999
00:42:36.379 --> 00:42:38.760
because it is worked out by itself.

1000
00:42:38.929 --> 00:42:41.010
But sometimes that also goes.

1001
00:42:41.729 --> 00:42:42.379
Upset

1002
00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:46.580
because of over creativity or a feeling that I have done.

1003
00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:48.090
I have done that.

1004
00:42:49.419 --> 00:42:51.110
Even a man like

1005
00:42:51.699 --> 00:42:52.540
great king.

1006
00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:54.669
Shivaji

1007
00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:56.389
was once

1008
00:42:57.139 --> 00:42:59.810
Little bit corrected by his great guru

1009
00:43:00.419 --> 00:43:00.939
Samath.

1010
00:43:03.419 --> 00:43:06.840
He corrected him because he felt that he is building the fort.

1011
00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:07.560
This

1012
00:43:07.879 --> 00:43:09.669
little idea went into his head,

1013
00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:12.229
and he immediately came and corrected to him,

1014
00:43:12.379 --> 00:43:13.449
and Shivaji,

1015
00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:15.870
he was a very humble disciple.

1016
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.159
He accepted the correction and because of that he's so great.

1017
00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:22.659
Never think that you are doing anything,

1018
00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:24.340
but it is done by him.

1019
00:43:25.669 --> 00:43:26.649
This is the best way

1020
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:29.110
to keep your Swatch all right.

1021
00:43:30.879 --> 00:43:32.679
Everything is done by him,

1022
00:43:32.879 --> 00:43:33.590
by rag,

1023
00:43:33.959 --> 00:43:36.550
a kind of a detached feeling should be developed,

1024
00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:37.110
but

1025
00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.469
it is rather difficult.

1026
00:43:38.679 --> 00:43:39.639
So through Sahajo,

1027
00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:40.669
when you realise,

1028
00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:43.159
then suddenly you become a

1029
00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:46.189
A detached person.

1030
00:43:46.459 --> 00:43:50.399
That's why I do not insist too much on this san chakra,

1031
00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:53.489
though it is very important after realisation.

1032
00:43:54.479 --> 00:43:59.729
After that is the chakra here in the centre of the heart.

1033
00:44:00.219 --> 00:44:04.300
Heart centre is controlling on both the sides.

1034
00:44:04.459 --> 00:44:05.090
One side,

1035
00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:06.870
it is controlling the heart organ.

1036
00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:08.129
On the other side,

1037
00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:09.570
it is controlling.

1038
00:44:12.159 --> 00:44:14.209
Sri Ramas Mariada.

1039
00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:19.050
It is Srira who exists on the right hand side,

1040
00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:21.810
and it is Shiva who resides

1041
00:44:22.139 --> 00:44:23.050
in the heart.

1042
00:44:23.419 --> 00:44:25.969
So their qualities are managed by them.

1043
00:44:26.179 --> 00:44:26.820
For Shiva,

1044
00:44:26.899 --> 00:44:30.419
you need not worry at all because Shiva is the existence.

1045
00:44:31.379 --> 00:44:35.489
But those who are hati yogis who try too much of energy,

1046
00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:37.040
too much of running about,

1047
00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:38.659
too much of hati karmata,

1048
00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:41.280
such people suffer from

1049
00:44:41.489 --> 00:44:42.399
the drainage

1050
00:44:42.689 --> 00:44:44.050
from the energy of Shiva,

1051
00:44:44.139 --> 00:44:46.179
and that's how they get heart attacks.

1052
00:44:46.379 --> 00:44:48.649
Most of the hata yogis who live

1053
00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:50.770
in their mundane life,

1054
00:44:50.899 --> 00:44:54.969
in their regular life of a householder get this heart attack.

1055
00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:57.379
A hatayogi has to live in the jungle.

1056
00:44:57.770 --> 00:45:00.739
He has to live with a guru with 6 things together.

1057
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:02.860
He has to work it out simultaneously,

1058
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:04.610
and that's why these people,

1059
00:45:04.629 --> 00:45:05.750
when they get a heart attack,

1060
00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:07.939
you are surprised that they look very healthy,

1061
00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:09.229
but how do they get it?

1062
00:45:09.389 --> 00:45:11.300
So too much strenuous

1063
00:45:11.909 --> 00:45:14.189
exercises also are not good for this.

1064
00:45:15.889 --> 00:45:17.719
But in the centre of this chakra,

1065
00:45:18.479 --> 00:45:21.739
The most important thing is known as Sacred Heart,

1066
00:45:21.919 --> 00:45:23.219
where Sri Durga,

1067
00:45:23.389 --> 00:45:24.389
the baby resides.

1068
00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:26.439
Durga Devi

1069
00:45:27.739 --> 00:45:28.610
Is the mother.

1070
00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:29.879
She's the jagaamba.

1071
00:45:30.209 --> 00:45:31.560
She is your mother,

1072
00:45:31.850 --> 00:45:34.959
and for you must know how to please your mother.

1073
00:45:35.169 --> 00:45:37.209
Mother can be easily pleased.

1074
00:45:37.409 --> 00:45:38.330
She is

1075
00:45:38.729 --> 00:45:42.649
so easily pleased because she's always trying to make you happy.

1076
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:47.290
How to make your mother happy is she doesn't

1077
00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:51.120
like that her child should take to things which are

1078
00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:52.639
not good for him,

1079
00:45:53.209 --> 00:45:57.040
or the child should starve himself or the child should be unhappy.

1080
00:45:57.209 --> 00:45:58.879
All these things work out here.

1081
00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:02.239
So when you have a problem in this part,

1082
00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:03.570
you should just say that,

1083
00:46:03.649 --> 00:46:04.159
oh mother,

1084
00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:08.189
forgive us because we did not know that we displease you and she is.

1085
00:46:09.709 --> 00:46:09.810
Yeah.

1086
00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:15.860
This is extremely important from Sergio's point.

1087
00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:19.820
Because you have been realised through the motherhood.

1088
00:46:20.830 --> 00:46:23.750
You have been realised through a special method of surgery.

1089
00:46:24.219 --> 00:46:26.090
I told you yesterday that it was.

1090
00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:29.340
Like the pattern of Sri Ganesh.

1091
00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:33.060
So for you it is necessary to know that

1092
00:46:33.709 --> 00:46:36.969
women are the embodiment of the shakti,

1093
00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:38.110
and your mother,

1094
00:46:38.149 --> 00:46:39.229
if you disrespect her,

1095
00:46:39.429 --> 00:46:40.469
she's not going to like you.

1096
00:46:42.389 --> 00:46:44.250
You have to respect your mother.

1097
00:46:44.739 --> 00:46:46.300
You have to respect sisters.

1098
00:46:46.459 --> 00:46:48.649
You have to respect other women in this world,

1099
00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:50.530
and you have to respect your wife.

1100
00:46:50.699 --> 00:46:52.610
You have to respect the women

1101
00:46:52.949 --> 00:46:54.379
because they carry the shirt.

1102
00:46:54.939 --> 00:46:57.139
But the women who do not carry the shatti,

1103
00:46:57.219 --> 00:46:58.979
the women who are ruined and spoiled.

1104
00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:01.439
are not the women

1105
00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:03.350
who about whom I'm talking.

1106
00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:09.959
Such women are actually be surprised at the outcome of the foolish treatment of men.

1107
00:47:10.719 --> 00:47:13.639
Who try to worship women who are bad.

1108
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.459
For example,

1109
00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:15.040
in the West,

1110
00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:15.590
you find.

1111
00:47:16.649 --> 00:47:20.949
They worship women who are not tall babies.

1112
00:47:21.199 --> 00:47:22.510
They are not goddesses.

1113
00:47:22.679 --> 00:47:27.080
They are in no way they can be called as something sublime.

1114
00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:28.530
They are horrid.

1115
00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:29.520
They are like ras.

1116
00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:31.080
You see,

1117
00:47:31.229 --> 00:47:34.219
now recently you have read about Elizabeth Taylor.

1118
00:47:34.449 --> 00:47:35.639
You have read about

1119
00:47:35.889 --> 00:47:37.239
this Jacqueline Kennedy.

1120
00:47:37.409 --> 00:47:38.800
You have read about these women.

1121
00:47:38.929 --> 00:47:40.290
How can you call them Davis?

1122
00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:41.770
You cannot call them Davis.

1123
00:47:41.929 --> 00:47:44.080
There is no Davis in them.

1124
00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:46.290
The women have to be like goddesses.

1125
00:47:46.850 --> 00:47:49.909
They themselves have to be goddesses and that

1126
00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:50.639
God

1127
00:47:50.959 --> 00:47:53.030
gives them power to be that.

1128
00:47:53.159 --> 00:47:55.469
All such women are respected,

1129
00:47:55.639 --> 00:47:56.679
have to be respected.

1130
00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:58.060
If they are not respected,

1131
00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:00.750
then the prostitutes will come and rule you.

1132
00:48:00.919 --> 00:48:02.870
Then the bad women will come and rule you.

1133
00:48:02.959 --> 00:48:06.310
Then the hiribas will come and spaha will come,

1134
00:48:06.399 --> 00:48:08.679
and they will try to spoil your family life.

1135
00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:10.370
Always the goddess,

1136
00:48:10.689 --> 00:48:14.639
they should be appreciated and worshipped so that she generates,

1137
00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:16.939
generates her babyhood,

1138
00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:17.560
her

1139
00:48:18.129 --> 00:48:19.790
saintliness into other.

1140
00:48:20.889 --> 00:48:21.830
A woman

1141
00:48:22.159 --> 00:48:23.020
doesn't dominate.

1142
00:48:23.239 --> 00:48:23.949
She does not.

1143
00:48:24.159 --> 00:48:25.870
She's not meant for domination,

1144
00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:31.709
but she has a capacity to take all the domination onto herself like this earth.

1145
00:48:32.090 --> 00:48:34.070
She takes all the domination into herself.

1146
00:48:34.239 --> 00:48:36.139
She is much more powerful than the man.

1147
00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:39.949
She can take all that into herself and she can bear it.

1148
00:48:40.159 --> 00:48:40.909
She can.

1149
00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.239
It is the.

1150
00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:45.320
Power of a woman who can do it.

1151
00:48:45.439 --> 00:48:46.639
The more you are powerful,

1152
00:48:46.679 --> 00:48:48.070
the more you can do it.

1153
00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:49.850
So the women who start

1154
00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:53.520
calling themselves to be men or sort of,

1155
00:48:53.879 --> 00:48:57.709
we must fight with men and we must become like men are really foolish

1156
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.110
because they want to come down.

1157
00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:03.110
Men are depending on their power,

1158
00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:04.110
so the women

1159
00:49:04.229 --> 00:49:07.840
are respected who have this power and respect such women.

1160
00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:13.780
And tell them because their understanding of things is more intuitive.

1161
00:49:13.989 --> 00:49:15.820
They understand things intuitionally.

1162
00:49:15.949 --> 00:49:19.310
You tell them whatever you think is wisdom and listen to them

1163
00:49:19.310 --> 00:49:23.459
also because they do have intuition if they are godlike women.

1164
00:49:24.989 --> 00:49:25.959
On top of that

1165
00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:27.760
is the chakra of

1166
00:49:28.189 --> 00:49:28.870
Sri Krishna,

1167
00:49:28.879 --> 00:49:30.060
as I told you yesterday,

1168
00:49:30.229 --> 00:49:32.270
which is called Vidi chakra.

1169
00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:36.810
I told you yesterday also that it has got 16 plexuses,

1170
00:49:37.179 --> 00:49:38.060
sub plexuses,

1171
00:49:38.090 --> 00:49:40.530
and it has got 2 more things added to it

1172
00:49:40.699 --> 00:49:44.729
that the ego and super ego arise from that point.

1173
00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:50.179
Now this is how a human being is controlled

1174
00:49:50.429 --> 00:49:51.620
by Shri Krishna,

1175
00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:53.050
and who is Shri Krishna?

1176
00:49:53.209 --> 00:49:57.030
Shri Krishna is the aspect of God which represents the art.

1177
00:49:57.689 --> 00:49:59.719
He's a great primordial being.

1178
00:49:59.929 --> 00:50:03.040
He is the whole in which we are all there.

1179
00:50:03.209 --> 00:50:04.129
So when

1180
00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:05.639
you feel small,

1181
00:50:05.850 --> 00:50:07.360
when you feel dominated,

1182
00:50:07.489 --> 00:50:08.919
or when you dominate others,

1183
00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:12.489
it is he whom you are insulting.

1184
00:50:12.649 --> 00:50:16.409
It is he whom you are not paying any attention to.

1185
00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:17.889
He is great,

1186
00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:21.080
so why should you dominate anybody else when he is great,

1187
00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:23.370
why should you take domination from anybody else?

1188
00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:27.129
The person who is balanced doesn't take any domination from anybody,

1189
00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:29.399
neither allows anybody to dominate him.

1190
00:50:29.699 --> 00:50:31.129
Now in this case,

1191
00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:33.899
one should understand that nobody can dominate

1192
00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:36.899
nobody as long as they are one with them.

1193
00:50:38.149 --> 00:50:41.070
Domination is such an artificial thing outside.

1194
00:50:41.899 --> 00:50:43.290
When you are powerful,

1195
00:50:43.659 --> 00:50:47.500
you dominate in a way because you are so powerful it flows,

1196
00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:49.199
the power flows to others.

1197
00:50:49.419 --> 00:50:51.679
But it is the power of love that flows.

1198
00:50:51.739 --> 00:50:54.649
Shri Krishna is the greatest thing of his life.

1199
00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:57.969
The message of his life of Shri Krishna is this.

1200
00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:01.850
When

1201
00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:03.489
Sri Krishna has said.

1202
00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:08.929
That the whole world is a Leela.

1203
00:51:09.979 --> 00:51:12.060
And you are a witness.

1204
00:51:13.929 --> 00:51:17.239
This is the essence of his incarnation,

1205
00:51:17.649 --> 00:51:19.919
that you are a witness,

1206
00:51:19.969 --> 00:51:22.570
you are just a sakhi of the whole place.

1207
00:51:23.379 --> 00:51:25.669
That's why we call him as a pura,

1208
00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:28.209
as a complete incarnation,

1209
00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:31.820
because he saw the whole world as a leader.

1210
00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:36.620
And he has told you that the whole world is a leader.

1211
00:51:37.929 --> 00:51:41.429
This is the essence of the viar who plays,

1212
00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:43.020
who at his whim plays,

1213
00:51:43.159 --> 00:51:44.070
he creates,

1214
00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:45.120
he recreates,

1215
00:51:45.239 --> 00:51:46.189
he destroys.

1216
00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:47.070
He does it.

1217
00:51:47.199 --> 00:51:49.070
He is the one who enjoys.

1218
00:51:49.219 --> 00:51:51.310
It is he who feels.

1219
00:51:51.439 --> 00:51:52.909
It is he who does.

1220
00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:55.239
We are just watching as a witness.

1221
00:51:58.780 --> 00:52:01.639
I've told the story of Rahaji,

1222
00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:04.050
who was jealous of the flute,

1223
00:52:04.689 --> 00:52:05.610
and she asked,

1224
00:52:07.389 --> 00:52:08.510
Strategy once

1225
00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:14.370
Now that he asked the flute that why are you so near to his lips all the time?

1226
00:52:14.459 --> 00:52:16.129
What is so special about you?

1227
00:52:16.659 --> 00:52:18.129
So the flute answered,

1228
00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:20.969
My specialty is that I have no specialty.

1229
00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:23.820
I'm a hollow personality because I'm hollow,

1230
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:25.409
he plays through me very well.

1231
00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:27.550
I do not stand anywhere in between,

1232
00:52:27.699 --> 00:52:28.419
and when he plays,

1233
00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.010
I do not destroy his play.

1234
00:52:30.179 --> 00:52:32.979
I just watch and I laugh at people when they say that

1235
00:52:32.979 --> 00:52:36.330
I play because they cannot see the great artist behind it.

1236
00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:37.290
It's like that.

1237
00:52:37.459 --> 00:52:38.419
You have to be.

1238
00:52:39.104 --> 00:52:41.665
and you become a witness as soon as you

1239
00:52:41.665 --> 00:52:46.254
get your realisation because you go into thoughtless awareness.

1240
00:52:46.514 --> 00:52:48.655
All your problems drop out like that.

1241
00:52:48.784 --> 00:52:50.854
You feel the whole load has come down.

1242
00:52:50.985 --> 00:52:52.294
You feel so relaxed

1243
00:52:52.584 --> 00:52:54.264
because you are just the witness of the play.

1244
00:52:54.465 --> 00:52:57.155
You are seeing the waves coming this way and waves going that way.

1245
00:52:57.264 --> 00:52:58.794
You are now on the boat.

1246
00:52:58.945 --> 00:53:00.435
You are not afraid of getting drunk.

1247
00:53:02.669 --> 00:53:05.610
This is what he calls at the witness state

1248
00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:09.820
and that happens to jogi which they know automatically develops

1249
00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:12.179
with some people they have a little bit assert

1250
00:53:12.179 --> 00:53:14.590
themselves and to stand there and remember it now.

1251
00:53:17.899 --> 00:53:19.340
Of course there are so many chakras,

1252
00:53:19.350 --> 00:53:21.969
so I have to go in a very short way.

1253
00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:23.290
We come now

1254
00:53:23.639 --> 00:53:25.969
to the most important also.

1255
00:53:27.010 --> 00:53:29.479
The chakra which we call in the brain,

1256
00:53:29.919 --> 00:53:30.510
which is

1257
00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:33.340
called as the Aga.

1258
00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:36.020
Now at this point,

1259
00:53:36.310 --> 00:53:39.530
both the ego and super ego are controlled like a screw.

1260
00:53:40.139 --> 00:53:41.100
If you move it this way,

1261
00:53:41.110 --> 00:53:41.969
it goes this way.

1262
00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:42.939
If you move it this way,

1263
00:53:42.949 --> 00:53:43.739
it moves this way.

1264
00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:48.000
the super ego was very much developed in the human beings.

1265
00:53:48.219 --> 00:53:52.209
Then the ego started developing too much and when it has come in the centre,

1266
00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:55.500
the thing has worked out and you go beyond ego and super ego,

1267
00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:58.310
you cross here and you come up and you see both of them

1268
00:53:58.310 --> 00:54:01.850
going down and then you become one with the ego of God.

1269
00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:03.449
Then he works.

1270
00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.239
You just watch the whole thing,

1271
00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:08.820
the whole Maa drops out and you know it's a balloon that goes down.

1272
00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:13.949
So the controlling point is that is very important.

1273
00:54:14.679 --> 00:54:17.189
But we spoil our gap by many things.

1274
00:54:18.399 --> 00:54:19.060
First of all,

1275
00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:22.469
and the foremost is that concentrate on this point.

1276
00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:24.159
I don't know who has told them this.

1277
00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:29.340
To concentrate on this point is the worst thing that you can

1278
00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:32.649
do to your agak because all such people have spoiled their age.

1279
00:54:35.090 --> 00:54:36.510
Our gas should not be spoiled,

1280
00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:38.500
supposing we have to make a dough.

1281
00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:40.919
Now we start

1282
00:54:41.169 --> 00:54:45.000
pushing on one side all the force that we have,

1283
00:54:45.169 --> 00:54:46.719
then the main door is locked.

1284
00:54:46.889 --> 00:54:48.000
The door is here,

1285
00:54:48.189 --> 00:54:49.120
not here.

1286
00:54:49.330 --> 00:54:51.040
So why to do this door first?

1287
00:54:51.050 --> 00:54:52.120
I don't understand.

1288
00:54:52.330 --> 00:54:54.449
What you have to do is to come up here and

1289
00:54:54.449 --> 00:54:56.780
then through all these doors you have to go down.

1290
00:54:56.969 --> 00:55:00.010
But actually we have broken this door and we are spoiled.

1291
00:55:00.209 --> 00:55:02.699
There are many ways by which we spoil our ay,

1292
00:55:02.889 --> 00:55:05.760
and the worst of all is through possessions.

1293
00:55:05.770 --> 00:55:07.850
We go on catching positions for everyone.

1294
00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:10.850
Our eyes are responsible for that.

1295
00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:12.870
Now you must respect your eyes.

1296
00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:16.030
The way we move our eyes at every small thing that is going on,

1297
00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:18.889
the way we call it the chance spoils the.

1298
00:55:20.459 --> 00:55:22.330
I always tell my Western

1299
00:55:22.810 --> 00:55:25.550
disciples that put your eyes a little down.

1300
00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:29.209
When Lakshwana was asked,

1301
00:55:30.199 --> 00:55:31.209
To describe

1302
00:55:32.110 --> 00:55:32.629
Sitaji,

1303
00:55:32.699 --> 00:55:32.949
he said,

1304
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:34.520
I have never seen

1305
00:55:35.110 --> 00:55:35.800
anything else

1306
00:55:36.110 --> 00:55:36.709
but her feet,

1307
00:55:36.719 --> 00:55:40.110
and so I only know what ornaments she had on her feet.

1308
00:55:41.899 --> 00:55:45.050
I would say like that you have to put down your eyes.

1309
00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:47.860
And watch

1310
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:52.739
In such a way that your eyes are not all the time turning down.

1311
00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:56.199
Not concentration,

1312
00:55:56.489 --> 00:55:57.530
but a sublimation,

1313
00:55:57.929 --> 00:55:59.139
a kind of a feeling,

1314
00:55:59.209 --> 00:56:00.520
a respect for your eyes.

1315
00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:03.129
Do not raise your eyes at every point.

1316
00:56:04.810 --> 00:56:06.810
There is no need to raise your eyes,

1317
00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:09.120
and it is a very good thing.

1318
00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:11.050
It creates a great dignity.

1319
00:56:12.090 --> 00:56:14.510
I'm in London and where I'm living,

1320
00:56:14.679 --> 00:56:16.120
it's a place where there are no

1321
00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:19.909
Indians living and they don't know even that I'm Mataji or anything,

1322
00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:23.389
but my habit of walking is that I always put my eyes down and walk.

1323
00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:24.090
So you see,

1324
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:26.560
those people have started saying that this lady is

1325
00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:29.600
something very unique because she never raises her eyes.

1326
00:56:29.639 --> 00:56:30.840
They've seen her eyes are always.

1327
00:56:32.889 --> 00:56:34.010
Raising your eyes

1328
00:56:34.209 --> 00:56:39.409
all the time and moving them upside down or on the sides is a very wrong thing.

1329
00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:40.129
Out of that,

1330
00:56:40.209 --> 00:56:43.540
so many bad habits which we call as flirting and all that have come.

1331
00:56:44.370 --> 00:56:45.330
Keep down your eyes.

1332
00:56:45.909 --> 00:56:49.100
And all the time looking at all the things that are displayed,

1333
00:56:49.139 --> 00:56:50.969
these plastic shops that you have around,

1334
00:56:51.139 --> 00:56:51.620
this is there,

1335
00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:52.300
that is there,

1336
00:56:52.379 --> 00:56:53.290
that is there.

1337
00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:55.919
All the lalas everything goes through the eyes.

1338
00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:59.500
So it is very important if you want to control your thoughts,

1339
00:56:59.739 --> 00:57:00.540
control your eyes.

1340
00:57:00.649 --> 00:57:02.120
It doesn't mean that you concentrate,

1341
00:57:02.219 --> 00:57:02.860
but keep it down.

1342
00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:04.959
Keep it to the heart.

1343
00:57:05.219 --> 00:57:05.870
She is,

1344
00:57:06.219 --> 00:57:07.209
she is your mother.

1345
00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:09.139
She gives you that dignity.

1346
00:57:09.850 --> 00:57:11.459
Keep the dignity of your eyes.

1347
00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:15.219
It is very necessary because you lose all the lustre of your eyes.

1348
00:57:16.110 --> 00:57:18.090
You'll have all kinds of problems.

1349
00:57:18.459 --> 00:57:19.770
Most of the people who are mad,

1350
00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:21.219
I found they have their argument.

1351
00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:25.040
I mean 99.9% of people have got a bad argument.

1352
00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:27.729
If you want to keep your argue all right,

1353
00:57:27.979 --> 00:57:28.570
please

1354
00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:31.949
never allow your eyes to go very much.

1355
00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:33.159
If it has formed a habit,

1356
00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:34.129
try to put it down.

1357
00:57:34.699 --> 00:57:35.290
It's easy.

1358
00:57:35.459 --> 00:57:36.919
Even the foreigners can do it,

1359
00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:40.090
but they are much more obedient because they feel so lost

1360
00:57:40.090 --> 00:57:42.290
that whatever I tell them they are willing to do,

1361
00:57:42.419 --> 00:57:43.610
they are much more obedient

1362
00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:45.580
than my Indian disciples are.

1363
00:57:46.219 --> 00:57:48.520
Because they have realised that they have reached a

1364
00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:50.840
point from where they are just going to break.

1365
00:57:51.709 --> 00:57:53.979
They have reached the last point of breaking,

1366
00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:57.100
and that's why when I tell them that you have to put down their eyes,

1367
00:57:57.189 --> 00:57:57.830
they walk like this.

1368
00:57:59.949 --> 00:58:00.580
For me,

1369
00:58:00.709 --> 00:58:03.340
it doesn't matter whether I raise my eyes or keep them down,

1370
00:58:03.550 --> 00:58:04.469
but when I raise my eyes,

1371
00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:05.830
I find some people start shaking.

1372
00:58:06.919 --> 00:58:08.189
Some people feeling nervous.

1373
00:58:09.139 --> 00:58:10.419
Some people elated,

1374
00:58:10.719 --> 00:58:13.489
so automatically I feel concerned about them,

1375
00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:17.260
so I put my eyes down so that they are not excited and their

1376
00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:20.179
positions do not disturb them when they are just walking on the street.

1377
00:58:24.929 --> 00:58:27.489
That is how we spoil our many a times.

1378
00:58:27.570 --> 00:58:28.439
There are many things,

1379
00:58:28.570 --> 00:58:29.100
but one of them.

1380
00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:30.500
The last.

1381
00:58:31.449 --> 00:58:32.649
The most important

1382
00:58:32.889 --> 00:58:36.959
is the alta where we have got 1000 nerves,

1383
00:58:37.570 --> 00:58:38.899
but when they are enlightened,

1384
00:58:39.010 --> 00:58:40.169
they look like flames.

1385
00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:41.120
I have seen them.

1386
00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:43.270
They look like 1000 flames,

1387
00:58:43.290 --> 00:58:44.929
living flames just like this.

1388
00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:47.729
And these flames,

1389
00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:48.709
when they open up,

1390
00:58:48.939 --> 00:58:49.979
they open up like that,

1391
00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:50.780
like a lotus.

1392
00:58:51.659 --> 00:58:54.209
And that's why in the Bible it said that

1393
00:58:54.209 --> 00:58:57.479
I will appear before you like tongues of flames,

1394
00:58:57.689 --> 00:59:00.360
but these Christians will understand what does that mean?

1395
00:59:00.689 --> 00:59:03.040
It is such a mysterious book because if,

1396
00:59:03.229 --> 00:59:04.760
if it were not that mysterious,

1397
00:59:04.850 --> 00:59:08.209
I think they would have killed even the 12 disciples of Christ.

1398
00:59:11.379 --> 00:59:15.090
So these 1000 petals are very important

1399
00:59:15.090 --> 00:59:18.709
and there residesarri Shakti the complete integration,

1400
00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:20.040
the complete

1401
00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:22.419
form of all these incarnations.

1402
00:59:23.729 --> 00:59:26.090
She is the person who organises and

1403
00:59:26.090 --> 00:59:28.969
coordinates and arranges and puts things together.

1404
00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:32.360
That's why

1405
00:59:32.550 --> 00:59:37.949
at the Sostrara you have to come and the Sostra is broken and from there flows.

1406
00:59:38.790 --> 00:59:44.090
Your own chita into this all pervading power and you feel these vibrations,

1407
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:47.030
these things flowing onto you for the first time.

1408
00:59:47.770 --> 00:59:51.679
Your central nervous system feels the divine.

1409
00:59:53.370 --> 00:59:53.929
Before this,

1410
00:59:53.969 --> 00:59:55.050
your central system

1411
00:59:55.330 --> 00:59:56.199
did not know.

1412
00:59:56.290 --> 00:59:57.620
It only knew the touch

1413
00:59:58.600 --> 00:59:59.199
of.

1414
01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:00.489
Hot,

1415
01:00:00.879 --> 01:00:01.159
cold,

1416
01:00:01.169 --> 01:00:01.600
and things,

1417
01:00:01.679 --> 01:00:04.270
but now you feel a person is hot or cold.

1418
01:00:04.439 --> 01:00:06.439
You feel a person is burning you.

1419
01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:09.800
You feel the blisters in your fingers when you look at somebody.

1420
01:00:09.959 --> 01:00:11.270
You sometimes feel

1421
01:00:11.639 --> 01:00:14.580
that a person is giving you beautiful cool vibrations.

1422
01:00:14.679 --> 01:00:15.449
I feel very happy.

1423
01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:15.770
Oh,

1424
01:00:15.919 --> 01:00:16.310
what a,

1425
01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:19.110
as if you are getting the fragrance of that.

1426
01:00:19.399 --> 01:00:21.469
First time you develop that nose,

1427
01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.320
you develop those eyes,

1428
01:00:23.479 --> 01:00:24.110
chucks you,

1429
01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:27.840
a special one that gives you the idea of the divine.

1430
01:00:30.169 --> 01:00:30.850
This subject,

1431
01:00:30.879 --> 01:00:31.949
as I have told you,

1432
01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:33.350
is so much,

1433
01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:37.389
and many times I have to repeat so many things because every time we get new people.

1434
01:00:37.959 --> 01:00:38.909
But in any case,

1435
01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:41.590
I have to give you a good news on this auspicious day

1436
01:00:41.590 --> 01:00:45.439
that we have been able to purchase a beautiful property in car.

1437
01:00:46.449 --> 01:00:47.270
This place

1438
01:00:47.409 --> 01:00:51.500
is known as Maya and is on the 17th route,

1439
01:00:52.090 --> 01:00:57.330
and this is a place where we are going to have our meditation centre also

1440
01:00:57.330 --> 01:01:02.479
an office for people who want to go and also we'll have a brain trust,

1441
01:01:02.570 --> 01:01:04.610
people who will explain to you what is,

1442
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:06.270
how to master it.

1443
01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:07.399
realisation,

1444
01:01:07.479 --> 01:01:11.090
do not give it up because it's a very great thing you have got it.

1445
01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.709
Now you can master it.

1446
01:01:12.919 --> 01:01:16.669
You become the masters of just like by raising your fingers.

1447
01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:20.159
You are going to give realisation to people because I have told you

1448
01:01:20.159 --> 01:01:24.679
that you are made after the pattern of who was all powerful.

1449
01:01:25.159 --> 01:01:27.159
No one could cross his powers.

1450
01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:29.800
In the same way,

1451
01:01:29.969 --> 01:01:30.239
you,

1452
01:01:30.250 --> 01:01:31.330
the Sahai today,

1453
01:01:31.570 --> 01:01:32.540
I promise you,

1454
01:01:32.570 --> 01:01:33.760
you try,

1455
01:01:33.929 --> 01:01:38.290
you will have such tremendous powers if you keep your chakras alive.

1456
01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.320
Try to keep them all right,

1457
01:01:40.409 --> 01:01:43.520
and these are the powers of God for which you are working.

1458
01:01:43.649 --> 01:01:44.850
You are made for that.

1459
01:01:44.929 --> 01:01:46.330
You are the chosen ones

1460
01:01:46.489 --> 01:01:50.879
who are being selected by God to do His work and to do his.

1461
01:01:52.879 --> 01:01:54.110
Glorious

1462
01:01:54.399 --> 01:01:55.830
and beautiful

1463
01:01:56.439 --> 01:01:57.909
complete edifice of such.

1464
01:01:59.100 --> 01:01:59.979
You are

1465
01:02:00.169 --> 01:02:00.969
the foundation.

1466
01:02:02.389 --> 01:02:03.000
And

1467
01:02:03.169 --> 01:02:05.330
there are thousands of children who will be

1468
01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:08.379
born who will know vibrations from their childhood.

1469
01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:10.530
They will know Kundalini from their childhood.

1470
01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:12.649
They'll work out on the Kundalini Shasta.

1471
01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:15.229
You'll be amazed how they know about it.

1472
01:02:15.489 --> 01:02:16.929
I've seen my own grandchild,

1473
01:02:17.169 --> 01:02:19.489
the way she is so clever at Kundalini.

1474
01:02:19.649 --> 01:02:21.100
Immediately she'll put on to that.

1475
01:02:21.250 --> 01:02:25.050
She'll bring something and push on to that man and take out his position.

1476
01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:30.050
I've seen many children being born and I have told you thousands of them will be born,

1477
01:02:30.219 --> 01:02:31.510
but they will be later on.

1478
01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:32.889
You are the foundation.

1479
01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:35.969
Soha Yogi has no business to be frivolous,

1480
01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:37.139
to be cheapish,

1481
01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:38.300
to be egoistical,

1482
01:02:38.449 --> 01:02:40.330
and to be fighting for small,

1483
01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:41.540
small differences.

1484
01:02:42.310 --> 01:02:43.209
You are not that.

1485
01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:44.449
You are chosen people.

1486
01:02:44.699 --> 01:02:45.770
Understand your dignity.

1487
01:02:45.939 --> 01:02:47.169
Understand your position.

1488
01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:51.209
You have been raised from an ordinary human level to this great

1489
01:02:51.699 --> 01:02:52.820
level of his.

1490
01:02:53.939 --> 01:02:55.020
I expect you.

1491
01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:56.659
To have

1492
01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:00.209
The

1493
01:03:00.659 --> 01:03:01.300
attention

1494
01:03:01.899 --> 01:03:02.570
placed

1495
01:03:02.979 --> 01:03:04.110
into yourself

1496
01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:06.169
and to understand your value,

1497
01:03:06.219 --> 01:03:06.939
your worth.

1498
01:03:07.709 --> 01:03:09.290
You are a diamond,

1499
01:03:09.459 --> 01:03:12.050
and diamond is not thrown in the dust

1500
01:03:12.459 --> 01:03:14.360
but is put on the pedestal.

1501
01:03:14.979 --> 01:03:16.290
You are enlightened.

1502
01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:18.610
Do not put your lights under the tables.

1503
01:03:18.739 --> 01:03:20.620
It is to be put on the

1504
01:03:20.889 --> 01:03:23.459
top porch places from where people can see.

1505
01:03:25.459 --> 01:03:25.870
Today,

1506
01:03:25.979 --> 01:03:27.300
it is the last day perhaps,

1507
01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:28.530
that I'll be meeting you.

1508
01:03:29.629 --> 01:03:32.000
Now I'm going away from Bombay.

1509
01:03:32.879 --> 01:03:34.360
And then I'll be going away

1510
01:03:34.659 --> 01:03:35.449
from India

1511
01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:36.409
about the

1512
01:03:36.610 --> 01:03:37.780
15th of April.

1513
01:03:39.209 --> 01:03:40.360
I have given

1514
01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:43.429
my maximum time to time to Bombay people

1515
01:03:43.679 --> 01:03:44.439
in the whole world.

1516
01:03:45.479 --> 01:03:45.969
Of course,

1517
01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:47.360
I am now in London,

1518
01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:48.669
supposed to be in London,

1519
01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:50.909
but most of the time I'm travelling

1520
01:03:51.199 --> 01:03:52.929
and I'm travelling all over

1521
01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:55.070
to meet my children all over,

1522
01:03:55.239 --> 01:03:57.790
but you are the greatest blessed people.

1523
01:03:58.429 --> 01:03:59.810
In this whole

1524
01:04:00.739 --> 01:04:01.449
world,

1525
01:04:01.899 --> 01:04:04.939
and that's why the responsibility is greater

1526
01:04:05.419 --> 01:04:07.949
because of certain reasons you were

1527
01:04:08.179 --> 01:04:10.969
here and I was here and it was done,

1528
01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:12.669
but feel your responsibility.

1529
01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:13.949
Don't be frivolous.

1530
01:04:14.179 --> 01:04:16.739
go deep down into it and take.

1531
01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:17.709
The charge,

1532
01:04:18.139 --> 01:04:19.889
we have to change this world.

1533
01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:22.090
We are the people who are going to ignite.

1534
01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:24.169
We are the people who are going to trigger it,

1535
01:04:24.239 --> 01:04:30.330
and we have to bring about the advent of which should take only 2 years more,

1536
01:04:30.459 --> 01:04:31.050
I think,

1537
01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:31.889
to start.

1538
01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:33.260
And as I have told you,

1539
01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:34.979
in the year 99,

1540
01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:36.290
it will be established.

1541
01:04:36.459 --> 01:04:36.939
I may,

1542
01:04:37.179 --> 01:04:42.770
I may not live to see the great work of my children who are so simple,

1543
01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:43.939
so ordinary.

1544
01:04:44.739 --> 01:04:46.300
They are not exceptional people.

1545
01:04:46.419 --> 01:04:48.010
They are very simple people,

1546
01:04:48.139 --> 01:04:49.330
but they are great,

1547
01:04:49.739 --> 01:04:52.419
very great sages who have been searching and today

1548
01:04:52.419 --> 01:04:55.250
they are born as ordinary people in Bombay.

1549
01:04:55.739 --> 01:04:57.929
May God bless you all on this day,

1550
01:04:58.139 --> 01:04:59.080
on this day when.

1551
01:05:01.189 --> 01:05:04.090
I feel that I may not be able to see you again.

1552
01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:05.830
And

1553
01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:06.909
despite

1554
01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.280
all my efforts,

1555
01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:11.229
I could not give much time this time also to you.

1556
01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:13.149
Next time I hope to come here,

1557
01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:17.709
but see to it that you go to your meditation every Tuesday we have,

1558
01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:19.070
and we have some other days.

1559
01:05:19.159 --> 01:05:25.840
You should take the address and devote time for your meditation and for yours.

1560
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:28.149
Growth

1561
01:05:28.389 --> 01:05:32.469
and your evolution so that others may be helped and you

1562
01:05:32.469 --> 01:05:35.770
tomorrow in the annals of history will go as the great

1563
01:05:36.030 --> 01:05:38.280
pioneers of Sahaji yoga.

1564
01:05:38.590 --> 01:05:39.429
May God bless you.

1565
01:05:58.510 --> 01:06:00.590
That if I can speak a few words to you.

1566
01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:03.310
On this oxygen of my.

1567
01:06:07.090 --> 01:06:07.500
Mata

1568
01:06:10.659 --> 01:06:11.669
Ladies and gentlemen,

1569
01:06:14.629 --> 01:06:16.340
I do not know what to say.

1570
01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:18.719
Because

1571
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:19.810
we are all

1572
01:06:20.550 --> 01:06:22.149
Those of us who can receive them.

1573
01:06:23.419 --> 01:06:25.659
are drowned in the vibrations

1574
01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:26.790
not only

1575
01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:28.939
of the presence of Mataji.

1576
01:06:29.709 --> 01:06:30.429
But of her

1577
01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:32.409
divine words.

1578
01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:36.189
I can only

1579
01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:39.870
Wish on this occasion.

1580
01:06:40.790 --> 01:06:41.169
Many,

1581
01:06:41.219 --> 01:06:43.949
many happy returns of Matai.

1582
01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:52.050
Not only in the usual sense.

1583
01:06:53.399 --> 01:06:54.040
But

1584
01:06:55.370 --> 01:06:58.909
The many happy returns in our presence so that we can hear

1585
01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:00.590
these wonderful words

1586
01:07:00.959 --> 01:07:01.870
and feel

1587
01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:03.320
these wonderful vibrations.

1588
01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:08.399
What these vibrations are,

1589
01:07:08.570 --> 01:07:11.909
I must confess that I cannot explain

1590
01:07:12.530 --> 01:07:13.449
or describe.

1591
01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.139
In the way in which mother can explain.

1592
01:07:17.469 --> 01:07:20.870
But I am also one of you who feel the vibrations.

1593
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:21.959
Whenever I remember B,

1594
01:07:22.639 --> 01:07:24.280
I immediately get those vibrations,

1595
01:07:24.479 --> 01:07:25.550
cool breezes,

1596
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.510
which put me into a

1597
01:07:27.959 --> 01:07:30.100
very serene sense of peace.

1598
01:07:32.610 --> 01:07:35.060
I can't explain to you anything more,

1599
01:07:35.350 --> 01:07:37.860
but I only congratulate you

1600
01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:40.790
for what you have been feeling and experiencing,

1601
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:41.790
because after all,

1602
01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:45.290
Religion and God are matters of experience,

1603
01:07:45.679 --> 01:07:46.370
peace,

1604
01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:47.419
love,

1605
01:07:47.739 --> 01:07:50.439
and lustre inside you under Joti.

1606
01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:52.969
Thank you very much

1607
01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:56.449
for listening to these few words after listening

1608
01:07:56.780 --> 01:08:00.580
to the words which came out from the depth of experience

1609
01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:01.909
of a kind

1610
01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:04.860
which cannot be described in books or described in words.

1611
01:08:06.489 --> 01:08:07.110
I

1612
01:08:07.489 --> 01:08:09.959
bow to the mother on behalf of you all.

1613
01:08:10.949 --> 01:08:12.389
And I wish her

1614
01:08:12.969 --> 01:08:13.179
many,

1615
01:08:13.189 --> 01:08:14.239
many years

1616
01:08:14.889 --> 01:08:17.470
of this divine service to humanity.

1617
01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:18.200
Thank you.

1618
01:08:37.450 --> 01:08:37.459
OK

1619
01:08:40.599 --> 01:08:40.608
OK

1620
01:08:42.049 --> 01:08:42.500
Oh

1621
01:08:43.429 --> 01:08:46.908
Abiham Mataji Artikare ups up

1622
01:08:47.219 --> 01:08:49.587
Dhayayeakarke dhan.

1623
01:08:51.279 --> 01:08:52.430
And I think it also once that.

1624
01:08:54.350 --> 01:08:54.799
Some of

1625
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.490
For

1626
01:08:58.259 --> 01:09:00.660
And spend some time from them who haven't got
