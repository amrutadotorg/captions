1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:05,840
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:13,440
May God give you wisdom and understanding

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,840
about the truth and about Himself.

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,400
Doctor Warren just now brought out a point

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,600
that if somebody is doing this work

6
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,360
in a split of a second, even

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,240
on the television when it was only one minute, if it works out,

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,600
then there has to be somebody special.

9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,040
All this kind of talk

10
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,120
is not necessary in India,

11
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,360
because Indians are well educated in spiritual matters.

12
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,360
They know what is the Shakti is, what is Kundalini is.

13
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,280
They know the chakras.

14
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,320
They are very well equipped.

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,720
They have got the names of the Shakti in which it is said so.

16
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,560
So to them it is not to be told and requested.

17
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,520
But in the West, though such great saints have been born,

18
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,400
such seekers are born,

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,160
they have forgotten the knowledge that they had,

20
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,320
perhaps, of the power of God.

21
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,240
And that's why I find the sensitivity of people

22
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,000
is not towards understanding the reality,

23
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,480
but more they take to artificial things.

24
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,720
Perhaps the more we are in contact with machine,

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,080
we become more akin

26
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,640
or close to machine.

27
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,840
We try to understand everything in a machine-like manner,

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,560
but not in that sensitive way, that people had once upon a time.

29
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,200
Even at the time of Christ,

30
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,160
except for few Jews who didn't like Him

31
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,560
because they wanted to have their own money-making propositions,

32
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,640
they crucified Him.

33
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,480
Even the judge who judged Him,

34
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,800
his wife could understand that He was a saint.

35
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,080
And the people around Him,

36
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,120
who were simple people,

37
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,440
all of them knew that He was something saintly.

38
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,440
Even at the time of Shri Krishna and Shri Rama, it has happened.

39
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,160
I agree that many saints have been crucified, have been tortured,

40
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,680
but not by the general public, by general people.

41
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,640
It has been done by people who were in power,

42
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,480
or who were prophesying some sort of a religion,

43
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,080
who thought that their religion is in danger

44
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,920
because they were making money out of that religion.

45
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,280
These are the people who did all these atrocities

46
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,560
and they brought forth this kind of calamity

47
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,120
or this kind of torture to the great saints who lived.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,280
But today is just the other way round.

49
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,320
The public is not sensitive enough.

50
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:27,520
That's a very hard thing to feel that the public itself

51
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,080
is not understanding what is the truth and how to come to the truth.

52
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,200
Yesterday in short I told you,

53
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,600
first of all we have to be honest people

54
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,320
if you want to find the truth.

55
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,280
Is a simple proposition that we have to be honest about it,

56
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,000
that we should know that we cannot purchase the truth.

57
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,240
Secondly, the truth is what it is.

58
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,200
Whatever are your own conceptions about truth is not the truth.

59
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,760
Is your own idea, your mental projection.

60
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,400
Truth is what it is. It will be for ever and ever.

61
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,040
And truth cannot compromise for you.

62
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,240
You have to compromise for the truth.

63
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,520
It is the other way round thing,

64
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,400
that you have to compromise for the truth.

65
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,840
You have to understand that so far those concepts you had,

66
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,320
relatively if they are not near the truth,

67
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,040
then you have to give them out.

68
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,760
It's a very strange thing

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,760
that you great people who are seekers,

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,400
are born in various countries,

71
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,720
in so many countries, I find.

72
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,440
And then at this juncture,

73
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,920
when it is not because there is so much sickness and all that.

74
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,040
But is a special time also.

75
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,160
Is a time of resurrection.

76
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,840
Is the time of your last judgment.

77
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,440
At this great times,

78
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:57,280
that people should lose their sensitivity to reality.

79
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,520
It is amazing how people take to artificial things.

80
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,160
So many things people have done just because

81
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,800
they could not see through.

82
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,640
That's why I requested you yesterday,

83
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,680
you must come to some logical conclusion.

84
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,240
You must use your brains and understand

85
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,480
that reality, if it lies within you

86
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,960
and if it is a living process of your evolution,

87
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,600
then it has to be done

88
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,680
in a way that is not done by human beings,

89
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,560
because no living work is done by human beings. It cannot be done.

90
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,640
We cannot transform one flower into a fruit,

91
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,080
leave alone a human being into a spirit.

92
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,840
So, it has to be done by the same process

93
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,160
which has made us human beings,

94
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,760
and the same process that is living force of God's love,

95
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,960
of living God's love, should do the job.

96
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,680
So it has to be spontaneous.

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,120
You cannot achieve it through your efforts.

98
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,280
Actually, those who tell you like that,

99
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,200
that "You have to achieve it through your efforts,"

100
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,360
or, "You have got your karmas.

101
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,920
You have got to suffer," and all that,

102
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,800
are just giving excuses.

103
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,440
They don't know how to achieve it.

104
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,120
They are just giving excuses.

105
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,120
You must understand that if you have got that power within you,

106
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,640
it has to manifest spontaneously.

107
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:30,040
For example, some people may not get realization.

108
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,440
May be little bit, very little bit percentage, I hope,

109
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,560
may not get it.

110
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,640
But that is nothing wrong with Sahaja Yoga.

111
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,600
There must be something wrong within you,

112
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,480
physically, mentally, emotionally.

113
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,240
There must be something wrong.

114
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,800
So we have to correct it

115
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,400
and we have to see that you get your realization

116
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,640
in a proper way and that it is achieved

117
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,760
through your own understanding, in your own glory.

118
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,360
That you should know that you have got your realization.

119
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,000
This is the only difference

120
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,240
between the evolutionary process so far from animal to this stage,

121
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,520
that human beings will be aware of their realization.

122
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,440
They will know all about it

123
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,440
because now they have become masters,

124
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,560
that they are not doing things automatically.

125
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,960
They will know that this power is flowing through them

126
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,520
and they will also know how to handle it,

127
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,080
which can be decode through Sahaja Yoga.

128
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:37,600
And you have to learn the technique of operating God's laws,

129
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,280
which are tremendous and wonderful.

130
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,120
You believe it or not: God exists.

131
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,040
His loving power is all-pervading.

132
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,720
We have never felt it before.

133
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,400
I agree there, you have never felt that

134
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,040
His all-pervading power is everywhere.

135
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,080
You have felt the ether,

136
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,320
through which we receive the television and other communications,

137
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,160
but you have not felt that subtle power,

138
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,600
which is all-pervading, not only but that,

139
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,520
but is the subtle of all these gross that you see.

140
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,160
But the time has come,

141
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,680
very precious time, that you have to get it.

142
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,120
So all your other identifications,

143
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,280
I am sorry, you have to drop them.

144
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,920
You have to just become yourself.

145
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,680
Whatever you have gathered in life time,

146
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,280
all kinds of concepts, and precepts and all that, forget it.

147
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,840
Just think that you are a human being

148
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,800
and you have to get your realization.

149
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,640
That's the most important thing.

150
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,680
All the rest of things are of no use.

151
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,560
So I would request you first of all,

152
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,000
in all honesty, try to be the spirit.

153
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,720
And if you become the spirit,

154
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:55,800
try to understand the path of progress in your spiritual ascent.

155
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,040
Now to come to the point of this

156
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,440
subtle instrument already created within us,

157
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,040
to come to this point we have to understand,

158
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,080
as I told you yesterday that this is the knowledge of the roots.

159
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,960
Whatever you have so far,

160
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,400
is the knowledge of the tree.

161
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,320
But you don't have any knowledge of the roots.

162
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,040
Many people have told me,

163
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,160
"Mother, what Christianity has failed.

164
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,360
That religion has failed. This religion has failed.

165
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,840
How can it be? If there is God, how can it be?"

166
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,360
I mean, there are communists also in this world

167
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,720
who deny God completely.

168
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,400
But is not that the religions have failed;

169
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,480
not the prophets have failed;

170
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,400
not the incarnations have failed.

171
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,400
It's the people who represented them,

172
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,160
wanted to make something of their own,

173
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,160
of their own concept, of their ideas,

174
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,560
and the whole thing has become such a market place,

175
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,240
that I just don't understand.

176
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,840
How can you sell God?

177
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,960
How can you sell His ideas?

178
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,840
There is no business about God.

179
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,840
Now this one is the great instrument that you have within yourself.

180
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,240
Yesterday I told you that you need not accept Me

181
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,360
as a sort of a conditioning on your mind.

182
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,640
But as a scientist, keep an open mind.

183
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,720
And this is the hypothesis I put before you,

184
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,680
and when it works out,

185
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,840
you have to see if it is all right or not.

186
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,640
Now some of you who might be doubting about it,

187
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,480
or thinking that, "Oh, it's all another story," or things like that.

188
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,160
They can go ahead with it

189
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,240
because Divine is not interested in such people.

190
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,520
Divine is only interested in people

191
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,240
who are honestly seeking the truth.

192
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,600
So this center that you see the first of all,

193
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,400
is a very important center.

194
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,720
I don't know what he has told you about it,

195
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,400
but is called as the Mooladhara.

196
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,120
It's the center of Mooladhara,

197
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,800
center of Mooladhara.

198
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,600
Mooladhara itself is that triangular bone,

199
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,200
which is a very small triangle. You cannot see it clearly.

200
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,080
We should have expanded it to show you,

201
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,640
which contains in itself

202
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,160
the power of Kundalini.

203
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,840
Is the power of that energy, which I told you yesterday,

204
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,160
is the pure desire to become one with God.

205
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,480
All other desires are not satiable.

206
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,400
That's why this is the only desire that has to manifest.

207
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,400
Otherwise, you are not going to be satisfied with your life.

208
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:53,520
Now, this pure desire exists in that triangular bone,

209
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,360
and you could see it also when you raise the Kundalini,

210
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,960
is pulsating there just like a heart.

211
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,000
But not on every person. Not on every seeker.

212
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,160
Only those who have a problem with the other two centers,

213
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:16,840
you can see with your naked eye, the pulsation of the Kundalini.

214
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,160
When there is such a pulsation of the Kundalini,

215
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,840
we have to know that these two centers

216
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,760
are in problem in human beings.

217
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,240
And these two centers are,

218
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,000
the higher one is called as the Nabhi Chakra,

219
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,120
which means the center, the subtler center of the navel.

220
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,280
And this center manifests outside,

221
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,240
what we call the solar plexus.

222
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,160
In the medical terminology is called as solar plexus.

223
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,960
But that's the gross thing.

224
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,480
This is the subtle center

225
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,000
which is in the medulla oblongata in the spinal cord.

226
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,600
Now this is a very, very important center within us again,

227
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,000
which was created since long, when we were seeking.

228
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,080
First, as animals we were seeking food.

229
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,640
Then also we were seeking our evolution.

230
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,960
Because animals also sought

231
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,320
their ascent

232
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,280
from a one-unicellular animal

233
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,720
to a multi-cellular animal,

234
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
like all the quadrupeds are or the mammals are.

235
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,600
How they arrived it, is no one can say.

236
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,160
because the power that worked for it,

237
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,480
lies in the central path of this central Nadi

238
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,840
called as Sushumna Nadi.

239
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,560
So first we were seeking the food.

240
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,360
Then we were seeking the shelter, as you go by in the history.

241
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,000
Then as we evolved more and more,

242
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,400
we started seeking our joy in, say, economics,

243
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,440
in possessions, then in politics, in power.

244
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,040
Then we evolved much more

245
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,480
and we thought there is no joy in all these things.

246
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,760
We have had enough of it.

247
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,840
Specially the affluence helped you a lot.

248
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,800
Because affluent people get fed-up of materialism,

249
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,320
and the plastic mountains that they have created.

250
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,840
And they just want to have something simple in life.

251
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,600
At this stage then they start thinking of their spirit.

252
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,800
They think, "How is it that we are not yet satisfied?

253
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,120
How is it we are so restless? What are we seeking?"

254
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,440
Some of them know what they are seeking.

255
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,800
Some of them don't know what they are seeking,

256
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,800
but even if they know what they are seeking,

257
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,760
they don't know how it will happen, and what should we expect.

258
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,520
That's a very important thing

259
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,440
where I find Indian people are better equipped.

260
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,640
But you have another great equipment,

261
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,400
that your desire to seek is very strong,

262
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,680
is extremely strong, and you go like a bull at it.

263
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,040
I have seen people who got realization,

264
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,520
and they were running so fast towards it

265
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,640
that even after getting realization

266
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,040
they would not accept that they have sought it.

267
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,760
They would not stop, you see. Like a bull is running very fast,

268
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,160
you see, even if you offer him something to eat

269
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,800
he won't be able to stop at that point.

270
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,720
He goes little ahead then he looks back, "Yes, that's it."

271
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
So he comes back.

272
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,200
It has happened with so many people

273
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,720
who have done a kind of a guru-shopping,

274
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,720
I would call it, it's a habit.

275
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,800
They take a bag in the hand with little money,

276
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,400
go round in the shop, "Now which guru is available?"

277
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,400
So they go to one guru, "All right, no good, hopeless."

278
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,600
Then he goes to another guru, third one.

279
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:49,400
And Sahaja Yoga is a temple somewhere away from that market.

280
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,640
So that habit is also formed in human beings of seeking

281
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:59,400
that even being introduced to Sahaja Yoga

282
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,840
and even after becoming the spirit

283
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,840
feeling the all-pervading power,

284
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,320
still they don't want to stop, because the inertia is too much.

285
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,440
And it's still they are going on.

286
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,600
But after some time, they reverse back.

287
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,240
I've seen many things like that happening in Sahaja Yoga

288
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,120
in every place I went to.

289
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,360
Specially in England is very common

290
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,280
that in first shot they just can't believe it,

291
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,000
"How can it be? It's not so simple."

292
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,320
Because then their ego is finished.

293
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,200
They have found it, "How can it be? We can't do it by ourselves."

294
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,280
So they forget about Sahaja Yoga for a while.

295
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,480
Then the Kundalini comes and tickles them all over.

296
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,640
Again She comes and clears them all over.

297
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,800
Then they start thinking, "What's happening to me?"

298
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,800
And then they come back to Me and say,  "Mother,

299
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,720
I must say there was something that had happened.

300
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,520
But I, just I was too fast. I was too speedy

301
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,640
and I just didn't get the glimpse of it."

302
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,640
All right, settle down now.

303
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,840
So that's one thing is always common and it's all right.

304
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,320
It's excusable; this doesn't matter.

305
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,560
You take your own time. I am not in a hurry.

306
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,480
But Divine is. Divine is in a very great hurry,

307
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,160
and the work has to be done in a very great speed now.

308
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
It is very important that we have to move

309
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,000
in a very tremendous speed.

310
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,040
So this seeking within us

311
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,080
is surrounded by this ocean of illusion, within ourselves.

312
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,040
This ocean of illusion comes to us because of our ignorance.

313
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,040
We see things which do not exist.

314
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,800
For example, there is a gentleman who comes to us.

315
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,080
He is very sweet to talk to.

316
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,280
And after sometime we find that we are missing our purse.

317
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,280
It's gone. He was very nice, very well-dressed.

318
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,600
Then how is it he's vanished?

319
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,000
Most of the bank robbers are very well-dressed people.

320
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,040
And the way they do it, it's surprising, how they befool.

321
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,440
Very intelligent people also, by their dress,

322
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,000
by their methods, and the way they perfect themselves.

323
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,080
So what happens that you cannot make out reality,

324
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,440
and this illusion is in everything we have,

325
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,280
and in that illusion, all the time we are lost.

326
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,120
We feel that, "This is the house I have made.

327
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,080
What a nice thing I have done. Such a great thing!"

328
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,560
But if you look at it,

329
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,120
after all, this is all dead from to the dead.

330
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,480
You make a chair; then you think, "Oh, I've made a big chair."

331
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,600
Now this chair is all right,

332
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,800
but tomorrow you won't be able to seat on the ground,

333
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,680
if you are sitting on the chair.

334
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,360
So like many illusions we have about things,

335
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,840
material things also. Say now, if I have, say, a beautiful carpet,

336
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,960
like this one. It's not mine, thank God.

337
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,280
But supposing it, I possessed it,

338
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,680
then I have to go to insurance company.

339
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,360
I have to look after it.

340
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,640
I should bother now, "Have you given it back to me or not?"

341
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,320
But if it is somebody else's, I am enjoying it

342
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,720
very well and without worrying about it.

343
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,320
But the idea of possessions also come in.

344
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:16,200
Then there is an idea of relationships also.

345
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,560
All these are such great illusions.

346
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,960
They just open out, absolutely open out,

347
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,480
as soon as you find the light of spirit in your attention.

348
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,280
Like in this room when you enter in, you find it's dark.

349
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,000
You catch hold of a chair. You will say, "The chair is the room."

350
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,320
Somebody will say, "This pillar is the room."

351
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,680
Somebody will say something else.

352
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,160
But supposing you just push a button, the light comes in.

353
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,280
Then you understand what is this room,

354
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,520
what is the relationship with each other.

355
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,360
The whole integrated knowledge

356
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,840
about this room comes to you, when there is light.

357
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,840
And this is what one should understand out of enlightenment.

358
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,240
But the illusion is, people think,

359
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,440
that when they are deluded, they are rising.

360
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,960
The other day somebody asked Me a very funny question

361
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,840
that, "Is schizophrenia, is it a step to enlightenment?"

362
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,560
Now can you imagine?

363
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,280
But then I heard that there is a very big book written

364
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,200
about this by some gentleman

365
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,080
who says that, "You have to become mad to become

366
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,040
a self or a spirit."

367
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,600
Can you imagine such a stupid thing?

368
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,560
It has not happened in any evolution of ours

369
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,480
and why should it happen now that we are human beings,

370
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,840
so beautifully created,

371
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,120
that we have to become mad to become something higher?

372
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,720
I have not heard of any mad person

373
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,760
who becomes higher by becoming mad, so far.

374
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,280
But this kind of a theory is going on.

375
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,960
So you can imagine, how there are delusions

376
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,800
and how there are illusions

377
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,360
and there are sources of these negative forces

378
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,720
which are giving you all the time

379
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,600
the waves and waves of this illusion that you live in this illusion.

380
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,800
So is doubly crowded, is doubly blackened,

381
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,360
and that's how if people cannot find the truth,

382
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,600
I am not surprised about it.

383
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,760
Now this place is called as Bhavasagara

384
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,040
- is the ocean of illusion in which we live.

385
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,080
And we are seekers.

386
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,560
So this one is bestowed upon by ten valencies that are within us,

387
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,160
because we must keep our valencies all right.

388
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,680
Even if you are in the, say, ocean,

389
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,640
our ship should be seaworthy.

390
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,920
Then any kind of illusion is not going to deter us

391
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,680
if we are seaworthy.

392
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,240
But seaworthy means, we must know if there is a fog,

393
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,120
how to move in right direction.

394
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,320
We should know how to overcome all the hazards

395
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,280
of all kinds of storms and all knowledge

396
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,160
should be built-in within us.

397
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,000
And that built-in knowledge

398
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,960
is, this Dharma as they call it, is a religion within you

399
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,240
not without, but within you, which are ten valencies.

400
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,840
As the carbon has four valencies, it has ten valencies.

401
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,480
So we have within us already a built-in system

402
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,720
which gives us this guideline.

403
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,920
But the illusion is such that in that illusion

404
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,920
we develop another problem,

405
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,160
and that is we never listen to right people.

406
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,040
The right people are the ten Primordial Masters

407
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,520
who came on this earth.

408
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,480
They have had many other masters also,

409
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,240
not that they were not right.

410
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,600
But major ten Primordial Masters came on this earth

411
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,640
and they gave us complete knowledge

412
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,800
as to how to balance ourselves

413
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,560
and keep to ourselves as human beings.

414
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,960
But then the question can be asked, "Why this balance? For what?

415
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,360
Why should we have this balance?"

416
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,840
First of all, to keep a good health.

417
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,360
Secondly, to have a very good nature.

418
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,600
Thirdly, to live like a human being with others

419
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,720
and not like donkeys or like lions.

420
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,840
It is a balancing thing which gives you a proper balance

421
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:23,320
to have a proper society, a proper [UNCLEAR ] life

422
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,720
in which you lead a normal life.

423
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,200
And you are not on your own,

424
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,600
by which you are in relation with the whole.

425
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,920
Now you see the relationship is from there to the whole.

426
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,480
But last of all, this balance is important

427
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,560
that you should achieve your ascent.

428
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,840
Any aeroplane which has got only one wheel will not fly.

429
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,720
Though it has to fly in the air but it has to have two wheels;

430
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,480
it has to have a balance.

431
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,000
An imbalanced thing cannot fly up.

432
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,920
That's why we have to have the balance.

433
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,360
And that is why these Prophets have taught us the methods

434
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,240
of how to balance, balance ourselves,

435
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,480
keep ourselves in balance and don't go to extremes.

436
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,560
But whatever they might try,

437
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,160
whatever they may say,

438
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,720
we just go in the opposite direction

439
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,280
of what they have told us.

440
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,600
And we really go into an extreme condition of fanaticism

441
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,120
or some sort of a torture to ourselves,

442
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,240
or some sort of a great harm to our being.

443
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,240
That's human nature.

444
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,680
That I cannot explain. Why so?

445
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,040
Why they are anxious to ruin themselves,

446
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,920
this is beyond Me to understand,

447
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,320
because God has tried His level best to make you happy.

448
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,320
He has tried to give you everything,

449
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,520
but if you are bent upon ruining yourself,

450
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,840
what can you do?

451
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,400
You see the sun is shining,

452
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,680
and is giving the sunshine to everyone,

453
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,200
but if some leaves want to get inside the mud,

454
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,680
what can the sun do?

455
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,080
I mean, it is like, "Come, bull, and hit me,"

456
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,080
sort of a process people take to.

457
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,640
I don't know why they take it.

458
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,760
This you may be able to explain better, but to My simple mind,

459
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,440
I just don't understand.

460
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,800
So these things happen to us by which we try to ruin ourselves.

461
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,600
Now the first of all, as they said about the curing part of it,

462
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,280
which I must talk to you about,

463
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,120
because it is not such an important thing in Sahaja Yoga,

464
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,800
there is no,

465
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,320
no accent on curing.

466
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,200
I mean, we don't say that, "We cure this and cure that." I mean,

467
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:37,080
it's not a hospital going on here, nothing of the kind.

468
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,360
It's just that if you get your realization,

469
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,400
as a bi-product you get well. That's it is.

470
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,400
But you see suddenly people ask you questions,

471
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,200
"Can you cure this? Can you?" I don't say, "I cure it."

472
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,640
You are going to cure yourself through your own ascent.

473
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,680
It can work out through Sahaja Yoga.

474
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,200
And then it becomes a headline for everyone,

475
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,560
"She can cure this disease, She can…"

476
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,240
It was surprising that even in the television

477
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,440
they had put Me as a healer and I was amazed to look at Myself.

478
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,840
What is this they have put it?

479
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,200
So they make out of you whatever they like.

480
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,320
In Sahaja Yoga, it is not the healing that is important,

481
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,520
it is becoming is important.

482
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,320
That you become the spirit is important.

483
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,120
You have to become the spirit.

484
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,160
Now, for example, I'll tell you one small thing here,

485
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,280
how imbalance causes so many troubles to us.

486
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,000
There is another center here down below, if you see,

487
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,400
is called as the center of Swadisthana,

488
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,000
which gives aortic plexus

489
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,840
as the gross manifestation of itself.

490
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,800
Now when this center goes into imbalance,

491
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,160
it goes round and round this ocean.

492
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,960
Also it can retract. It can go further.

493
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,480
What happens?

494
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,400
Now this is a center for our future

495
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,000
and for our creativity when it comes to the right.

496
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,960
And when it moves to the left because it has got a step,

497
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,440
like a lotus it moves.

498
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,960
And if it comes to the left,

499
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,360
it acts for something what we call

500
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,960
unauthorized, anti-god activity.

501
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,800
So another one is also unauthorized,

502
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:23,840
because when we say that, "I am doing that,"

503
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,360
then it is ego, is created in you

504
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,760
and which passes into that pouch there in the head like a balloon

505
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:36,440
and you form a big institution of ego in your head.

506
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,080
On the other side is this one,

507
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,760
where it comes to the left or any conditioning that takes place,

508
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,680
that people say, "Don't do that, and don't do that,"

509
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,840
and all kinds of conditionings through any kind of teachings,

510
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:54,840
that creates another institution is called as superego.

511
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,920
Now when we go to the extremes of anything,

512
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,040
how problems are caused, example of that

513
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,840
I will try to give of one center,

514
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,480
because there is no time for Me to cover all the centers.

515
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,400
Take this Swadisthana Chakra.

516
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,560
It has a very important work to do,

517
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,160
is to transform the fat cells of the stomach

518
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,560
for the use of the cells of the brain.

519
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,560
Brain also is made of fat cells,

520
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,120
and when a person thinks,

521
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,840
this special Swadisthana Chakra

522
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:39,000
converts the fat cells for the use of the brain.

523
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,680
Now, when you think too much for the future,

524
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,440
you think, think, think. I mean, people are mad with thinking.

525
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,760
Some of them did tell Me,

526
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,440
"Mother, you cut my throat, do what You like, but stop my thinking."

527
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,600
It has become another inertia sort of thing.

528
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,720
They just go on thinking.

529
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,680
They just can't stop thinking, whatever they may try.

530
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,200
So when this process starts of thinking,

531
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,360
then what happens that this Swadisthana, poor thing,

532
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:07,480
goes into a great speedy

533
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,360
process of transforming the fat cells.

534
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,080
Now it has some other work to be done.

535
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,480
Now this is going to the extreme, to think about everything.

536
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,840
Sitting down they will think that now they have become

537
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,040
the Prime Minister of Australia,

538
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,200
so what should they do to correct.

539
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,960
I mean, there's nothing like an election.

540
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,400
Nothing has happened, but they are already thinking

541
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,120
for the Prime Minister.

542
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,520
If they are driving on the street,

543
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,400
they are thinking for all the Police Department.

544
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,240
If they are building one house,

545
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,120
they'll try to find faults with another house

546
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,560
so that he should not have done,

547
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,560
while the house they are going to make might collapse.

548
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,920
But all the time the idea is to see

549
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,760
and think about everything else that doesn't concern them.

550
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,240
So this heavy load on your head

551
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:57,400
makes it a big ego there.

552
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,960
Apart from that, ego which is a horrid thing,

553
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,040
which can make you absolutely stupid,

554
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,360
but apart from that,

555
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,960
it makes this poor Swadisthana Chakra work so hard

556
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,120
that you neglect other important things in your body,

557
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:17,440
the organs like your liver.

558
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,480
Such people have very bad livers,

559
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,400
those who think all the time, plan all the time.

560
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,520
They will plan. Even the ladies will plan all the cooking.

561
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,800
Imagine, ladies planning all the cooking.

562
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,080
It's absurd! Because you go to the market,

563
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,320
you have planned for the fish and there is no fish in the market,

564
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,400
and you are upset because you can't cook fish.

565
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,680
But why did you plan?

566
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,800
Whatever you get, you bring it home and cook it.

567
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,160
That's the best way.

568
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,400
So this planning business also goes on too far.

569
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,160
When we go to the extremes it so happens,

570
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:53,160
that we make this work too hard and we get a liver trouble.

571
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,400
Then we get also the pancreas out of gear,

572
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,160
because pancreas has to work,

573
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,120
has to be worked though this Swadisthana Chakra.

574
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,160
When it is out of gear, the disease you get is diabetes.

575
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,600
The simple thing as diabetes.

576
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,320
Now in India if you go and see the villagers in India,

577
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,640
they take at least five spoons of sugar;

578
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,680
otherwise, they don't think it's a tea.

579
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,600
For tea, they must have five spoons of sugar,

580
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,640
and they never, never suffer from diabetes.

581
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:27,440
But in the cities, where the people even just touch the sugar,

582
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,280
they get it back in their urine.

583
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,680
So something wrong with the city people.

584
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,400
And what is wrong with them is,

585
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,480
that they are using this Swadisthana Chakra

586
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,680
all the time for thinking and thinking and thinking.

587
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,520
Now another disease that one gets out of it,

588
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,840
is the disease of the spleen, which is a very serious thing.

589
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:53,640
Spleen produces red blood corpuscles

590
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,000
according to the necessity of the person.

591
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:03,000
Now, any emergency arises, it starts producing more RBCs.

592
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,760
Our life is such that we are always in emergencies. Everyone is.

593
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,760
Whether he is a shop keeper or he is a minister,

594
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,240
everybody seems to be very busy.

595
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,320
Now, in the morning first of all to read newspapers,

596
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,640
is another curse.

597
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,280
Because you read newspapers, you hear, "This is burnt.

598
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,200
That is finished. So many died.

599
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,000
Somebody in the aeroplane finished off,"

600
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,920
maybe our relations are there

601
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,400
- so you get a real pain there in the stomach.

602
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:35,320
That's done by this poor spleen. It goes into a big process,

603
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:41,040
into a very big mechanical production

604
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,840
of RBC starts.

605
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,680
Now when that happens to you then you don't know

606
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:53,440
that you better keep the spleen now at least

607
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,240
little rested for other things.

608
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,960
But just then you will ask for a breakfast.

609
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,360
You will get into the car,

610
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,560
with a breakfast in your hand eating that.

611
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,440
And there is a jam in the way,

612
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,240
and then you are screaming at, because you are late.

613
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,400
All sorts of things happen to us like that

614
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,600
and we go on creating emergencies for ourselves. For what?

615
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,400
What are we going to gain out of it?

616
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,640
With this hurry and scurry what have we achieved?

617
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,400
So this spleen goes out of order.

618
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,200
It does not understand the crazy person.

619
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,160
It becomes crazy itself.

620
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,760
And it starts producing red blood corpuscles,

621
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,720
this thing, that thing.

622
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,240
Now you become vulnerable

623
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,200
to a horrible disease called as leukemia.

624
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,480
Of course, it is triggered by something else,

625
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,560
about which I may be able to tell you, today or tomorrow.

626
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,080
But you are just vulnerable for a disease

627
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,600
called leukemia where just doctors will say

628
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,400
you may die within one month or two months.

629
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,360
That's all they can say about leukemia.

630
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,600
Now such a person doesn't realize that,

631
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:00,200
"I have brought this disease upon myself by being like this."

632
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,360
We are human beings.

633
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,320
We cannot rattle like tins.

634
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,520
We have to live like human beings.

635
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,720
The way we rattle ourselves morning till evening

636
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,600
is so dangerous for our being

637
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,120
that we must have a balance in our lives.

638
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,040
We must learn how to rest. And rest is also another problem.

639
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,640
Then they will go to the sea,

640
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,920
burn themselves up, completely extreme.

641
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,120
I don't know why this fashion has started from where.

642
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,680
Must be somebody must have put this into the ideas.

643
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,000
You see, this is a very recent one.

644
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,800
About twenty years back nobody bothered about sun-bathing.

645
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,400
Nobody knew about it.

646
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,080
When, you see, I just don't understand also

647
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,640
the psychology of the West when they don't like black people

648
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,920
- they are immigration problem -

649
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,840
why do they want to become black themselves?

650
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,280
They tan themselves. There are tanning companies,

651
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,960
this, that, all kinds of things have started

652
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,920
and that's how they, you know, you get the disease

653
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,520
called cancer of the skin, which is a very serious disease.

654
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,440
And this beauty fashion is also for whom?

655
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,520
I mean, I just don't understand that in India people think that

656
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,320
you are very good-looking people because you are fair,

657
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,080
and here you think Indians are better

658
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,840
because they have got darker skins.

659
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,240
So whatever we have, we are not satisfied with it.

660
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,640
But it's not so important that

661
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,960
we should kill ourselves with this sun-tanning to that extreme.

662
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,520
So that sort of an extreme

663
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,920
you do it with this Swadisthana Chakra,

664
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,640
and you have problems of this kind.

665
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,640
But also your tension can rise if you use too much of

666
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,200
this Swadisthana Chakra because

667
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,680
your kidneys also become poor things.

668
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,840
They don't know how to adjust to your madness.

669
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,160
They way you lead your life,

670
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,600
you don't think you are a human being.

671
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,800
You think you are an supersonic aeroplane.

672
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,760
Then poor kidneys don't know how to work you out.

673
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,240
I mean, you are made by God, not by human beings

674
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,080
who have made super-sonic aeroplanes, this, that.

675
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,720
And the super-sonic aeroplane doesn't think.

676
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
First of all it saves its energy because it doesn't think.

677
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,000
First of all when you think,

678
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,040
you are spending most of your energy,

679
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:07,200
and actually the way you spend your energy with an extreme way,

680
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,360
you develop all these horrible diseases.

681
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,760
Now what happens actually

682
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,360
when you start doing too much to the right or to the left?

683
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,480
Now, the right side is a thing

684
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,400
where people become extremely fanatic, very disciplined.

685
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,600
All military people, you see, hot-tempered.

686
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,800
You can't just go near them.

687
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,640
If you go near them you will get nothing

688
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,560
but heat coming out of them.

689
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,960
They are very hot-tempered people, angry people.

690
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,160
They lose their temper.

691
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,600
You just can't talk to them

692
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,120
because if you say a word, they will box your nose.

693
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,440
This type of people are so many in this world, you can't imagine.

694
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,200
So many of them are, I have seen.

695
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,600
I am amazed how they exist with themselves.

696
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,320
Why don't they box themselves sometimes? They might be.

697
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,240
They are full of anger, frustration and

698
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,960
all kinds of bad feelings about others and about themselves.

699
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,480
All these people, all this kind of people,

700
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,080
come up when you become very austere.

701
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,200
You say, "Oh, I will have no indulgences.

702
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,960
I am absolutely living on a shoe-string

703
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,080
and eating just two leaves per day."

704
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,280
Such people will thin out and they will look like mosquitoes.

705
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,440
But I don't mind their looks,

706
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,800
but the way they bite you, is the worst part.

707
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,360
And they are sometimes regarded as the beauties.

708
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,640
Then God save us from the beauties,

709
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,400
because if they become the world beauties [UNCLEAR]

710
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,480
whatever beauty contest, you see, so, models, this, that,

711
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,680
then they are lost people, absolutely lost to any senses.

712
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,120
They become really stupid.

713
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,760
Now this kind of extremity comes to the right side.

714
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,640
The left side comes when you indulge into something like drugs.

715
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,800
Now people might say, "What's wrong in drugs?"

716
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,760
It does such a damage to you. It does.

717
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,000
People may not believe it, but it does.

718
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,120
It does finish you off on your left side.

719
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,600
As the alcohol may finish off your liver,

720
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:13,040
the left side is completely jammed by the drugs you take,

721
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,360
because you move more towards the left.

722
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,960
And the more you move,

723
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,840
you go from your subconscious to the collective subconscious,

724
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,160
and then you are attacked by negative forces,

725
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,840
and that's why it attacks your brain also.

726
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,800
Such people can just become gradually into

727
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,600
into a state of just like cabbages

728
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,400
and they would not even realize how it is happening.

729
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,280
So all these things are harmful to us.

730
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,280
Indulgences into anything can make you left-sided.

731
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,800
Eating too much,

732
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,400
there is one person eating two leaves, another is eating so much.

733
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,400
See, all these extreme behaviors, as I said,

734
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,200
create a very big problem.

735
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,960
Now how cancer can be caused, we have to see.

736
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,080
Then I will move to other things.

737
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,360
That, supposing this is the center,

738
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,760
and this center has got left side and right side.

739
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,640
At every emergency, both the sympathetic nervous systems

740
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,320
which are expressed by these two Nadis

741
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,640
go into action, and when too much action starts,

742
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,600
what happens, the relationship is broken.

743
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,960
And the deities, who are controlling these, go off to sleep.

744
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,840
And when the relationship with the whole is broken,

745
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,440
when it is broken, then

746
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:36,800
you have no control from the main,

747
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,200
you can say, from the whole,

748
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,160
and the cells become on their own.

749
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,720
When they become on their own, so individualistic,

750
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,240
they become malignant.

751
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,600
For example, if it happens in the stomach,

752
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,760
you will find the liver will become so big.

753
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,240
Or if it happened in the mouth or nose,

754
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,440
the nose will become so big. The rest of has no chance.

755
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,200
It's a very ego-oriented stuff.

756
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,840
It goes increasing, increasing.

757
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,600
And also if you live with an ego-oriented man,

758
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,160
you can become also ego-oriented.

759
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,080
Hitler is one of the examples of that,

760
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,320
how he made people ego-oriented and so stupid.

761
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:20,240
Actually so horrible by his own great ego that he developed.

762
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,960
So these cells also become like that

763
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,560
and they make other cells also malignant

764
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,040
and that's how the cancer is settled.

765
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,720
Now to such a patient, what have we to do?

766
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,480
You have to try to raise his Kundalini.

767
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:39,160
By giving some power there at that point, you can pacify.

768
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,080
You can give some additional, as you call the petrol,

769
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,800
to the exhausted one.

770
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,040
And gradually when it is done,

771
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,360
it comes back to its normal  [UNCLEAR:could be - 'ways' OR 'phase'].

772
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,800
Then you put the Kundalini through it.

773
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,640
So it makes an ascent and keeps it in place.

774
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,200
It awakens the deity in that center

775
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,760
and that center looks after the gross side of life.

776
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,320
That is how cancer can be cured.

777
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,440
It's true that Sahaja Yoga has cured cancer

778
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,480
of so many people and some people in

779
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,440
ten minutes have got rid of their cancer.

780
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,760
Ten minutes, is a fact.

781
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,640
But that doesn't mean that I am going to cure everybody's cancer,

782
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,000
by any chance. It is not so.

783
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,840
You see, the trouble with people is,

784
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,840
they say, "Do you claim you can cure cancer?"

785
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,600
I say, "I don't claim. But Sahaja Yoga can do it."

786
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,680
"Then you must cure this cancer."

787
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,120
I said, "Why? Why should I cure?

788
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,520
Are you paying Me something?

789
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,720
Have you called Me here?

790
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,240
I have come My own.

791
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,120
If I want I will; otherwise, I will not."

792
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,200
You see, it is like a aggression of this kind on a person that,

793
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,920
"You must show how you can cure."

794
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,040
Why should I show? I don't want to show it.

795
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,640
Like I had a very big lecture in the medical college,

796
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,400
medical institute in India,

797
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,960
and of course the Vice Chancellor was very much impressed.

798
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,160
But some of the doctors they came and they said,

799
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,680
"Mother, we will give you four patients of cancer

800
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,800
and you cure them."

801
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:09,600
I said, "I have no time. I am very busy.

802
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,640
You better ask them to come to Sahaja Yoga,

803
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,400
get their realization and cure themselves.

804
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,160
I have no time for that. I am sorry.

805
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,840
I am busy with other work."

806
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,800
So, then they said, "All right.

807
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,400
Do you have any file of the patients you've cured?"

808
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,280
I said, "I have none. I have no time for filing."

809
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,800
It just flows. It just works.

810
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,640
What am I to write down everywhere?

811
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,560
This is it. I have cured this x, y, z, for what?

812
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,840
I have no clientele. I do not have to cash it.

813
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,440
So why should I do it?

814
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,440
It's just flowing. Those who want to have it,

815
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,640
can have it and can work it out.

816
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,240
But you cannot force Me

817
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,080
that,  "You must write down and …", for what?

818
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,960
What is the purpose?

819
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,960
I am not running a hospital.

820
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:53,240
I don't have to have a credibility on that, if I cure or not.

821
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,200
For that doctors have to get their realization first.

822
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,840
If they don't get their realization, I am not bothered.

823
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,800
If they are really bothered about cancer,

824
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,120
or any other disease, why don't they take their realization

825
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,160
and help their patients? They can.

826
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,520
But the patients who are not interested in God,

827
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,920
God is also not interested in those patients.

828
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,000
It's common sense. God has the greatest common sense.

829
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,760
The lights which are never going to work out,

830
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,320
which are absolutely useless,

831
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,840
you are not going to repair them, will you?

832
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,800
No human being is going to do that.

833
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,200
What's the use of repairing a light

834
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,640
which is never going to work out?

835
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,840
So God is also like that.

836
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,600
He has such a lot of common sense.

837
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,760
He is not going to waste His energy for these things.

838
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,360
The most important thing today is not to cure people

839
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,480
but to give them realization;

840
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:43,560
to redeem them, to evolve them, is the main part.

841
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:47,080
You can be counseled, you can be told, everything explained,

842
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,280
you can be brought to logically conclusion.

843
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,360
But the aim is to get your realization

844
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,680
and not to worry about your illness.

845
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,720
Illness will disappear gradually.

846
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,600
It has happened with so many people

847
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,080
and it should happen with you.

848
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,560
But it should not be a condition,

849
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,280
that you come to Sahaja Yoga as an obligation on us

850
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,680
that,  "We have come to Sahaja Yoga, you better now."

851
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,800
That's not so, because, as you know, we have no organization.

852
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,680
There is no organization that we have.

853
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,840
You have to come humbly to it, and it works out.

854
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,600
God is the ocean of compassion, ocean of love.

855
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,560
He is the one who is so anxious

856
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,720
that you all should enter into His kingdom

857
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,600
to occupy your great seats as His children.

858
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,200
He is the Father of the Fathers.

859
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,280
He is the most loving Father you could think of.

860
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:36,840
Then when we challenge Him like this, He doesn't like it.

861
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,080
We have to enter into His kingdom in a humble way,

862
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,320
and He will definitely bestow His blessings on all of you,

863
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,480
because He is the one who is so anxious.

864
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:49,120
I Myself amazed at the way He is blessing people.

865
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:52,600
Imagine six thousand people before Me, they just get realization.

866
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,600
Can you imagine such a thing happening?

867
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,400
I have seen Myself. It's happening.

868
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,840
So many things are happening today

869
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,720
that is evident that God is very gracious,

870
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,400
as well as He is wrathful.

871
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,520
He is a wrathful God for people

872
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,520
who do not take to Him.

873
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,640
He is wrathful. And that's why one has to be careful.

874
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,600
If you lead a life on your own - "What's wrong?"

875
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,640
"What's wrong" is one of the philosophies people have

876
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,080
- then you have to pay for it, this way or that way.

877
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,600
So as a Mother I have to tell you that, "Why not?"

878
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,400
When you have got everything.

879
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,640
You have got the spirit within you.

880
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,400
Is the power is within you.

881
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,320
Everything is there. Why not get your realization?

882
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,360
Why succumb to this useless ego which is not yourself?

883
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,840
You are not your ego. You are your self.

884
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,960
You are your spirit.

885
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,640
And that spirit, when it comes to your attention,

886
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,720
you become such a wonderful person.

887
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,600
The whole thing is lost.

888
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:56,520
Like a lotus rising out of the mud,

889
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,560
it covers the whole of that pond

890
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,960
and its fragrance fills the atmosphere with such beauty.

891
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,200
That's what happens to you when you get it.

892
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,640
So why not have that?

893
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,960
This is your own, within your self,

894
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,760
and the Divine is so anxious.

895
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,280
I don't know what is the missing point.

896
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,840
Today, I am sorry they have today called Me

897
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,520
after this program for a radio, and I am going there.

898
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,360
I don't know how many people are going to attack Me on the phone.

899
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,400
You see, all kinds of things they say on the phone.

900
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,440
But I told them I will not receive the phone.

901
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,120
You better receive the phone and let Me know.

902
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,120
Because all these things are subject to,

903
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,480
I find that people use it for just call sometimes,

904
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,440
for not expressing anything good

905
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,920
but for expressing something that's

906
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,440
inside them anti-God, absolutely anti-God thing.

907
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,560
I hope today they will behave themselves

908
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,800
and it will be a good time for them

909
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,160
that they should enjoy the bliss of God.

910
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,600
I must thank for people who rang Me up to say

911
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,360
that they received their vibrations on the television.

912
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,120
And that they telephoned to Me

913
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,800
and they found out My phone number,

914
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,440
because My phone number was not available.

915
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,920
And it should happen to all of you today,

916
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,400
that you should get your realization.

917
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,320
So the first intense feeling should be

918
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:15,000
that we should get our realization, somehow we get it,

919
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,240
and then we will talk about the rest of the things.

920
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:22,560
Yesterday I gave a lot of time for questions.

921
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:28,440
And today I think we have very little time.

922
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,160
But still I can allow you to ask two-three questions

923
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:35,600
and then we should go ahead with the procedure of realization.

924
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,160
But too many questions are not needed.

925
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,040
What you need is your realization.

926
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,800
Actually, if you ask too many questions,

927
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,640
sometimes the realization doesn't work out.

928
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,680
Not to frighten you but I tell you,

929
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,240
because your mind starts working.

930
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,720
You have to, you see, take it beyond your mind.

931
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:53,240
Tomorrow I'll tell you about that great chakra of Agnya,

932
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:56,080
which is bestowed upon the deity of Jesus Christ.

933
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,600
That how, when the Kundalini rises through it,

934
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,320
how He sucks in these two horrible things called ego and superego,

935
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:07,320
and how you become thoughtlessly aware and you come in the present.

936
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:11,960
And you become, when it comes out of your fontanel bone area,

937
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,360
the real baptism takes place and you get connected.

938
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,720
You get connected with the whole

939
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,400
and you become collectively conscious. You become.

940
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,800
Again I say, it is actualization.

941
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,520
It is not just talking that, "We are all brothers and sisters,"

942
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,600
but you just become it, comes in your awareness.

943
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:32,400
And you start feeling the other person on your fingertips,

944
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,320
yourself, on your fingertips.

945
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,800
As Mohammed has said,

946
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,520
"At the time of resurrection, your hands will speak."

947
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,840
He has spoken more about this time than about the doomsday.

948
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,200
But all the Muslims are talking about the doomsday only.

949
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,960
I don't know why they are waiting for that before this.

950
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,920
So first the resurrection time has to come

951
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,600
because in all graciousness and kindness and compassion of God,

952
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,640
He is going to give us a full chance to achieve ourselves,

953
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,200
because this is His creation.

954
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,840
He is anxious to do it.

955
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,600
He doesn't want His creation to be destroyed.

956
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,840
So, may God bless you.
