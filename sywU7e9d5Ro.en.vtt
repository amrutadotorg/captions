00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:08.090
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:25.560
At the very outset we have to understand that
truth is what it is.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.630
We can not conceptualize it.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:38.640
We can not organize it and we can not know
it at human awareness.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:49.300
If we had known that truth at human awareness
there would have been no problem.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:58.990
There would have been no second opinion and
there would have been no quarrel, no problems

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:06.640
and we all would have been in the realm of
peace and joy.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:18.159
But what we see today is that we are moving
towards some sort of derailment and we do

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:27.460
not know where we are going and what is the
end of our civilization.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:42.139
These are modern times and special times where
so many are aware of this kind of a destructive

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:49.060
force working on us and suddenly they have
become alerted and they want to know what

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.430
is beyond it.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.909
What is the truth?

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:06.049
As I have already stated that you can not
know the truth at human awareness.

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:13.040
Of course, whatever I am going to tell you,
you have to keep an open mind about it.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.700
Like Scientist you must listen to Me as if
it's some sort of a hypotheses.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:28.790
But If I prove it then I am sure as honest
people you have to accept because it is for

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:36.350
your benevolence, it is for the benevolence
of this country, benevolence of the whole

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.250
world.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:48.500
It's a understanding that I want you to be
at, that we have to know something more about

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:57.980
ourselves and about the whole collective problem
that is today before us.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:06.890
So the knowledge that I am going to give you
about is the knowledge of the roots.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:13.730
You have the knowledge of the tree that the
civilization has grown like a very, very big

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:23.100
tree and if we do not know our roots this
civilization can be completely destroyed.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:31.310
In the eyes of the divine no body is divided
like Indians, Canadians, English.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:38.530
They are all the same creation of the divine
power.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.830
Now we talk of God, we talk of Love, I was
reading God is love.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.780
But by saying that why should people believe
you?

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.390
Is there God or not?

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.530
Is it true or not?

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.220
We have to establish it.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:01.190
We have to prove it and unless and until we
prove it, it is not going to be accepted by

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.610
the progeny.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.070
Nobody is going to take it as if some sort
of a blind faith.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.250
All right you were born in this religion so
you follow it whether it is Christianity,

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.150
Hinduism, Islam or anything.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:24.130
So we have to awaken ourselves into that new
awareness by which we can know the absolute

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:33.350
truth and we can know that divine power which
is surrounding us.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:41.570
All this compartments that we have made around
ourselves will break and we'll see the dawn

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:50.820
of a new era where we will know that all of
us are capable of achieving that great height

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.270
of awareness.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.350
Of course, you can not pay for it.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.910
Nowadays there are so many in the market who
are selling divine gifts.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.860
You can not sell it.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.750
As Christians we have to realize that Christ
didn't sell anything.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.790
On the contrary, he took a big hunter to hit
the people who were selling things at the

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.150
gate of the temple.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:24.680
So those people who are selling or marketing
things can not be anywhere near divinity because

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.900
divine doesn't know money.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:36.520
Money is a creation of human being and this
is where I fail to see in the West a response

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.880
to Sahaja Yog.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:47.180
I mean actually people told Me that we can
not understand anything which does not require

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.930
money.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:56.380
We have to little bit get out of this and
understand that divine can not be purchased,

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:03.870
can not be sold, it is just to be enjoyed.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.910
There is a system built-in within us.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.510
I don't know if they have shown you ... yes,
it is there.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:20.630
Inside ourselves there is a very beautiful
system built-in during our evolutionary process.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:26.620
One by one gradually it was built-in within
us and that is how now we have become human

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.620
beings.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:38.640
There is a little bit more gap we have to
cross over so that we jump into that new awareness.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:50.139
As they must have told you about, that there
is a power within us, which is called as the

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:51.139
Kundalini.

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:56.700
And if it is awakened, it passes through six
centers, piercing through our fontanel bone

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:04.130
area and gives you Self Realization, meaning
like this instrument is here and unless and

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.220
until it is connected to the mains it has
no meaning.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:14.690
In the same way we are to be connected to
that force which has created us.

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:20.471
And that has to be, that has to extremely
simple because it is so vital.

00:07:20.471 --> 00:07:30.310
Like our breathing is so important, so it
is so vital and it is absolutely free.

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.320
We don't have to go and read books for that.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:40.169
Especially happening of this Kundalini is
an extremely easy thing and it works out very

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:48.199
fast and in thousands and thousands of people
it has worked and I am sure in Canada it has

00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:50.130
to work.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:08:05.910
It is rather the desire to become a Self-Realized
soul than anything else that is important.

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:14.660
If you have a strong desire to be connected
with that divine power by which you know absolute

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.390
truth.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:24.790
That's all is needed and it works so fast
because this power is the power of pure desire.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:33.400
All our desires that we seek are not satiable,
in general.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:39.010
One desire gets satisfied we run after another,
another desire gets satisfied we run after

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:40.010
another.

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:49.870
So now there is a desire within us which if
is satisfied then we get the satisfaction

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:53.180
that we wanted.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:09:00.880
With this awakening of the Kundalini, which
has been worked out now for eighteen years

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:06.790
because I have been working for the last eighteen
years, I should say twenty years as such because

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:10.980
I started my work in 1970.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.870
We have seen that people get cured of incurable
diseases.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:23.610
How does it happen, that these centers which
are the sources of energy within us are exhausted

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:27.720
when we use them too much either on the left
or on the right.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:38.190
As the result of that exhaustion causes physical,
mental, emotional diseases from which we suffer.

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:45.780
So now supposing you have any physical disease
that physical disease can be cured if energy

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:49.250
supplied to that part of the body.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:58.000
So when the Kundalini rises this center gets
nourished which is being exhausted and when

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.462
the Kundalini is connected to the mains, all
the time the energy is flowing within you,

00:10:02.462 --> 00:10:05.110
you get all right.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:11.209
And there are diseases, which are somatic
and there are diseases, which are psycho.

00:10:11.209 --> 00:10:17.520
That is the diseases are caused by, supposing
you go to a wrong guru there will be a problem,

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.410
a person who spoils your psyche.

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:26.750
There are so many ways these days we spoil
our psyche, drugs and other things that we

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:36.310
do which spoil the psyche and the person start
going into the habit of getting more and more

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:39.120
dominated by those habits.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:46.100
So when the Kundalini rises She brings the
attention in the center, by which the left

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.420
side habits are cured.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:52.290
And so your psychic troubles are also cured.

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:59.220
Your habits are cured and then there is another
type of disease we have, what we call as psychosomatic,

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:07.460
these are the diseases like cancer, say Aids,
all viruses, all kinds of multiple sclerosis

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:15.040
and all such diseases, they are also caused
by the imbalance in your attention, by the

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:18.399
imbalance in your being.

00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:25.490
So when you come into balance these can be
cured, very easily without taking any medicines,

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:29.070
without going to any doctor, without doing
anything special.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:32.800
The whole system is built-in within you, which
works it out.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.310
But you have to take it up seriously because
supposing you have to go for medicine.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:38.880
I don't know what is the course here is.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:44.200
But in India if you have to do medicine you
have to put in really fourteen to fifteen

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:49.910
years, precious fourteen-fifteen years of
life to get only a graduation.

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:58.640
But for this you don't have to because once
the Kundalini rises and you get balanced and

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:04.029
then you feel the joy and the peace within
yourself.

00:12:04.029 --> 00:12:08.220
Gradually you settle down and you become a
master.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:14.060
You become yourself knowledgeable because
on your finger tips you start feeling the

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:20.950
cool breeze and you can feel it in another
person, what's the matter with his Chakras

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:29.970
or what is the problem he is facing, on your
finger tips and it's all said in Quran, imagine,

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:35.180
Mohammed Saab has said that at the time of
resurrection your hands will speak, of course

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:39.430
the Muslims are not worried about the future
part, they want to just talk about the past

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:43.130
and they don't want to think of resurrection,
same about the Christians.

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:46.330
Christ has said I will send you the Holy Ghost.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.850
But they are not looking out for the Holy
Ghost.

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:54.550
Same about Hinduism, in every religion it
is said that such and such time will come

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:58.670
when you will get your Self-Realization.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:04.730
But people are not looking for that because
those who are in-charge are money oriented.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:09.120
And they want to mislead you by saying that
if you don't do this you are a sinner, if

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:14.010
you don't do that is a sinner but they don't
give any solutions to the problem and there

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:21.300
is a very big solution within us, this one
and that really helps us to overcome all this

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:27.700
ignorance which is created by the vested interest.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:34.470
Now this Kundalini when it rises it as I told
you it solves your physical, mental, emotional

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:45.149
problems, also it solves your social problems
because you start understanding the relationship

00:13:45.149 --> 00:13:46.410
of other people.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:50.740
Like, now, you are sitting here and there
is no light.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.430
We don't know how we relate to each other.

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:58.500
But when there is light we can see for ourselves
how we are related, how we are trodding on

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:07.950
another's freedom, how we are behaving and
the whole thing becomes a very enlightening

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:14.550
experience and that enlightenment is not harsh,
it's beautiful, it is love.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:23.730
And, then you realize that you have got the
power to feel like a computer the absolute

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.120
truth.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.279
You can feel it on your fingertips what's
wrong with you, what's wrong with others.

00:14:29.279 --> 00:14:35.890
Now if you know how to correct it you are
all right, not only that but you become a

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:42.540
powerful personality, a dynamic personality
without feeling any tension about it.

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:48.140
Tension comes because you have imbalances
but when you are balanced and when you are

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:52.670
connected to the mains and all the time the
energy is flowing into you there is no question

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:53.670
of tensions.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:15:01.589
We have no tensions and you are in a joyous
condition because you become Self-Realized

00:15:01.589 --> 00:15:06.980
means you become the truth that is that you
are the Spirit.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.829
You become the Spirit.

00:15:08.829 --> 00:15:15.029
And when you become the Spirit, the Spirit
as it is said, it's a fact that is the source,

00:15:15.029 --> 00:15:17.960
first of all of knowledge.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:23.329
Like a person comes, say, it's happened, I've
seen many people who came from jail, they

00:15:23.329 --> 00:15:28.820
have no credibility of any kind, they wear
some sort of a funny dress, appear in the

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:33.520
square and people just start calling him a
guru and such a guru starts minting money

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:42.490
out of you and head along people go towards
that person and think it is a very big thing.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:47.829
Another one comes and says that I am such
and such and I have these powers and that

00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:53.240
power you just believe into that person, pay
him money and get lost.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:16:00.810
Like these there are no norms to find out
what is the truth and what is not the truth

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:06.279
but of course, you can find out one thing,
that a person who takes money, how can he

00:16:06.279 --> 00:16:08.459
be related to God?

00:16:08.459 --> 00:16:11.490
How can he be related to Divine?

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:16.120
Anything that works on money cannot be relationship
with God.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:23.550
Of course, now for example, this hall has
to be, say, hired, all right, the Canadian

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.180
Sahaja Yogis, we have many have hired it.

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:31.139
Formally, in the beginning I used to hire
them but now they are hiring it, that's a

00:16:31.139 --> 00:16:35.630
different point but for Self-Realization you
cannot pay.

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:40.910
That happening is absolutely a living process
of our evolution.

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:49.180
And this evolution, that we are at a human
level we haven't paid anything.

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:53.600
So why should we pay for anything that beyond
this.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.970
It is a living process, of a living energy,
of a living God.

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:06.900
So one has to understand, first of all, that
at a very ordinary level also that you can

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.169
not pay for God.

00:17:09.169 --> 00:17:13.920
You can not pay for Divine.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:18.280
You can not purchase it and the second is
you can not put any effort.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.600
It's an effortless happening, just like sprouting
of a seed.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:29.140
It is an effortless happening which takes
place and when it takes place, then you just

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:33.179
know yourself, you certify yourself.

00:17:33.179 --> 00:17:37.170
You don't have to have others to certify that
this is this, this is that.

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:39.480
And you don't take false certificate.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.080
For example, somebody might say, "All right,
I am born again."

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.929
By taking such a certificate you do not become.

00:17:45.929 --> 00:17:50.120
It is not that any organization can give a
certificate.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.299
It's a state of be-ing.

00:17:52.299 --> 00:18:00.750
You have to be that in that state, only, honestly
you have to be that otherwise just to say

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:02.400
that I am such and such, it's cheating yourself.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.160
What's the use?

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.179
It's not going to help you.

00:18:06.179 --> 00:18:08.460
It's not going to help others.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:14.130
So first of all you must understand that it
is the becoming that is important.

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:19.080
It's not what people are saying about themselves,
talking about themselves.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.440
Like there are some people, the other day
I met who were selling lots of Geeta.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.710
I asked what's the use of reading Geeta?

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:28.340
It's all bookish knowledge.

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.340
To read Geeta also you have to have Self-Realization.

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:32.830
And then I met some people who were selling
Bibles.

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:35.260
Now we have been selling Bibles for ages.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:36.910
What's the use?

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:42.010
To read Bible also, to understand Christ also,
you have to have Self-Realization.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:48.630
Otherwise you can not understand what He said
and all of them have said one thing that you

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.490
must have your second birth.

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:52.610
You are to be born again.

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:57.549
But that again one can use it as a placard
saying we are born again.

00:18:57.549 --> 00:18:59.330
So we should not cheat ourselves.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:01.610
What's the use of cheating ourselves?

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:06.559
Tomorrow some disease comes in, some trouble
comes in, tomorrow our children take to drugs

00:19:06.559 --> 00:19:12.500
or do something wrong, they go and murder
people, all kinds of violence then who is

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.660
responsible?

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:19.710
We, because we have avoided to know about
the truth and it's all there built-in within

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:23.200
us, it's just there, which we have to have.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:28.641
So now, the first quality of the Spirit is
that you become knowledgeable, Knowledgeable

00:19:28.641 --> 00:19:29.641
about anything.

00:19:29.641 --> 00:19:31.630
For example, somebody says that there is no
God.

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:37.290
Say, in Russia I went, of course, the Russians
are some or other, the government is horrible

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:42.150
but the people are really their attention
is so good that they just touched it, and

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:43.809
thousands and thousands.

00:19:43.809 --> 00:19:49.420
You won't believe that in Moscow I never had
less than fourteen thousand people or Leningrad

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.420
same thing.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:54.120
In Kiev I had nothing less than five thousand
to six thousand people.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:20:01.070
And the Government itself took it so seriously
that, I mean they invited about six hundred

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:02.070
doctors.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:06.490
I read it in the paper they have put it only
three hundred, it may sound big but the fact

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:11.280
is about six hundred doctors came in and two
hundred great scientists who have done Sputnik

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:18.960
and all that and they all surprisingly asked
for one thing 'Mother give us Realization.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.360
We want to have our Self-Realization.'

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:26.789
So what I feel, whatever I've read about Russian
writers is that there has been always a soul

00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:28.090
searching within themselves.

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:32.750
If you read any one of them you will find
there is a soul searching and they find out

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:34.190
what am I doing?

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:35.350
Is it correct?

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:36.590
Why should I do it?

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:37.690
What is the problem?

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:44.450
And that soul searching within themselves
is because they have no choices, like we have

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:47.470
here in our countries all kinds of freedom.

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:53.880
We waste our energy in finding out what breakfast
we will have, what lunch we will have, what

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.520
dinner we have, what sort of a blouse we should
wear.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:00.350
I mean such a lot of waste of energy, it's
a joyless pursuit.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:05.330
While they don't have that chance not that
they are not well off, I would say they dress

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:07.040
up well, they have good clothes.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.040
They live well.

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.230
They have all nice houses.

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:11.500
Everybody who is married gets a house.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:15.220
But they always felt that they are not free
to get to their Spirit.

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:16.880
And that's what they were struggling.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:21.250
As soon as they saw Me, there is no place
for false gurus.

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:22.809
Nobody wants them.

00:21:22.809 --> 00:21:27.940
When I spoke to them in one of the seminars
they had a yoga seminar, when I walked out

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:32.250
everybody came out and there were other gurus
who had come, nobody was there in the hall

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:33.520
to talk to them.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:41.020
They are so keen and so alert that they know
that you can not pay for it.

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:45.809
And there is no hanky panky about it just
telling stories this will happen that will

00:21:45.809 --> 00:21:46.820
happen.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:52.070
And now in all Eastern Block you will be surprised
Sahaja Yoga is spreading very fast.

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:58.700
Bulgaria we had fifteen thousand people, fifteen
thousand people in Bulgaria, so you can imagine.

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:03.250
I have to also go to Romania, I've not been
there but there are, those Sahaja Yogis who

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:06.480
went there have written to Me that they got
five thousand people.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.240
Sahaja Yogis got it.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:13.669
So you can imagine how fast they are moving
and the day may come they might become very

00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:16.281
powerful people than we are.

00:22:16.281 --> 00:22:17.870
We have become weak.

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:20.680
We have become very weak internally.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:25.549
Externally we have money, we have good roads,
good telephones, everything but internally

00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:29.970
we are weak because first of all we can not
get over our habits.

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:34.040
Secondly there are all kinds of negative forces
working on us.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:38.280
And we are so vulnerable we do not know how
to fight it out.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:43.660
So it's better that we become the Spirit to
know the knowledge, to have the knowledge

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:46.710
about what is good and what is bad.

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:57.100
The second thing about Spirit is that when
it comes into your attention you become enlightened,

00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:00.320
in the sense there is light and you see the
truth.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:04.570
For example, you are standing with a snake
in your hand and it's all darkness, you can't

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:08.770
see, I tell you it's a snake throw it away
but you will not listen to Me.

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.880
You will say why, why, what's wrong.

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:16.010
I mean many people have told Me what's wrong,
what's wrong if you are doing this what's

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:19.379
wrong, till that snake bites them they will
hold it on.

00:23:19.379 --> 00:23:21.500
So you put on the light.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:25.190
As soon as you put on the light they will
drop the snake by themselves.

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:31.410
This is what I say that you become your own
guru and you follow your own understanding

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:37.090
with the light of the Spirit within you, which
is your own.

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:42.299
But this enlightened attention works, it acts.

00:23:42.299 --> 00:23:47.210
You can close your eyes and find out about
anyone what's the matter with that person.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:51.030
And if you know how to cure that person it
can work out.

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:54.330
You do not know how this Divine power works.

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:59.520
This, all pervading Divine power is the most
efficient government, the most efficient,

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:05.530
we can call the housewife, the most efficient
father, mother everything.

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:12.530
Anything that you need is done so beautifully
that you are amazed and so many miracles happened

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:16.770
that you are amazed, how, what have I done,
why am I so much blessed.

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:21.520
I had asked people to write about their miracles
because they used to write letters after letters

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:26.289
and I've no time to write so I said you write
to somebody about the miracles and let him

00:24:26.289 --> 00:24:27.289
take out a book.

00:24:27.289 --> 00:24:31.240
Now the pile has gone this way and this way
and it lost in that pile.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:34.760
He said Mother what am I to do, is such a
lot.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:39.190
So we have to know that we are special people.

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:48.070
Human beings are at the epitome of the evolution
and that a little more is going to give you

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:51.490
the meaning of what you are.

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:58.440
So this enlightened attention makes you aware
of your powers also by which you can give

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.600
Realizations to others.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:06.850
You can correct them, you can cure them, and
you can give them peace and joy as you have

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:07.850
the joy.

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:12.080
Now you see these people they are mostly Canadians
here or Americans.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:19.490
Now to teach one sentence of English is very
easy and to teach the whole of English also

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:26.460
is easier but to teach one word of Sanskrit
is so difficult to an English man.

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:31.470
They ruled us for three hundred years and
we tried our level best to teach them some

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:36.300
English and whenever they would come up and
speak something we would say what language

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:37.300
are they speaking.

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:39.100
We couldn't understand the language.

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:44.320
So it so very difficult to pronounce this
Sanskrit as well as the Indian languages.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:49.950
But the way these people sing, I mean in India
people can't understand how they have picked

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:55.290
up this difficult language, this difficult
music, this difficult rhythm.

00:25:55.290 --> 00:26:00.179
How they have done it and they sing, if you
hear from outside, you won't believe that

00:26:00.179 --> 00:26:01.760
they are Canadians were singing.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:06.640
You think they are just some Indians some
very good singers from India singing.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:07.740
How have they got it?

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:12.961
It is because of the new dynamism they have
developed in their creativity and we have

00:26:12.961 --> 00:26:24.850
so many artists and musicians who have really,
as you say touch the roof, they have hit the

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:30.309
roof, like in their fame, in their success,
in their creativity.

00:26:30.309 --> 00:26:34.470
So you become extremely creative but you become
very humble.

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:39.970
You are not egotistical, you do not force
your things on to others, but automatically

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.750
because you are so good that you shine.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:47.460
There are so many artists especially in India
musicians who have achieved great heights

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.950
with Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:53.500
And it has to work out everywhere that we
should understand the essence of music and

00:26:53.500 --> 00:27:02.400
how it really soothes human beings by which
you will, not for success but it is just for

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:07.190
expression, work out but automatically it
becomes successful.

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:11.500
Now this is not only that I'm trying to lure
you to some ideas.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:16.820
But what I am trying to tell you within you
lies all these powers and if you have not

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:24.929
utilize and if you have not make use of that
and then you are unhappy no body can help

00:27:24.929 --> 00:27:25.929
it.

00:27:25.929 --> 00:27:28.910
It is all there which you have to have.

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:37.570
Now the Spirit gives you the knowledge of
truth.

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:47.309
Spirit gives your attention the light and
Spirit is the source of joy, as if you were

00:27:47.309 --> 00:27:53.970
getting drown in the waves of your thoughts
and worries and problems.

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:57.190
Suddenly you find you are in a boat and you
are enjoying everything.

00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:58.910
You are seeing it.

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:03.690
When you see your problem you can solve it
better and there is the Divine power to solve

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:09.820
all the problems that you have, then you learn
how to swim.

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:15.250
You can jump into the same waves, which have
bothered you and save other people and so

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:24.860
a new dynamic personality you develop because
you become collectively conscious about which

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:31.000
Jung has written that now human beings will
become collectively conscious.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:37.360
It is the consciousness, which is expressed
in our central nervous system by which you

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.240
can feel the other.

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:44.299
Now my hand, this hand if it is hurt the another
hand can feel it, the whole body will feels

00:28:44.299 --> 00:28:47.539
it and tries to help.

00:28:47.539 --> 00:28:54.320
Now who is the other when everybody is a part
and parcel of the whole, who is the other?

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:58.830
For example, we were going to have a program
here and you will be amazed we have people

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:04.429
even from Austria who just came, they had
holidays so they just came running to help

00:29:04.429 --> 00:29:07.360
the Canadian people here that they are very
few.

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:10.590
So better run down and help them.

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:13.570
We have people all over the world.

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:16.330
Sahaja Yoga is working in forty countries.

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:22.679
And when I went to Russia it is so gratifying
to know that the first people who came to

00:29:22.679 --> 00:29:28.340
Russia to help the Russians were twenty five
Germans.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:34.159
And the Germans were so gentle, so beautiful
you won't believe that their fore fathers

00:29:34.159 --> 00:29:37.320
fought with that horrible fellow Hitler.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:45.429
No, they are so gentle, so beautiful and when
I saw them working on these Russians with

00:29:45.429 --> 00:29:49.050
such love, with such attention, with such
understanding.

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:57.549
I felt that it's another world they're existing,
which is so beautiful and so nice.

00:29:57.549 --> 00:30:04.700
In one program I don't know how much I can
tell you about it and we have here a proper

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:07.159
Ashram where you can go.

00:30:07.159 --> 00:30:11.130
We have here people who have their programs
where you can go.

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:16.320
But their complaints are that Mother when
You come, I don't know what happens they come

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:20.990
to Your program all right but after that they
never come and they get lost.

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:27.289
I just don't know why is it so because you
just what I can do today is like a sprouting

00:30:27.289 --> 00:30:31.710
of the seed but after that you have to grow
into a tree.

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:36.730
Unless and until you grow into the tree it's
a myth as in your Parable of Christ some fell

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:38.309
on the rocky areas.

00:30:38.309 --> 00:30:40.960
Some fell in the marshy areas like that.

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.480
It should not be.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:51.000
It should be it fell into areas where people
prospered and became great trees.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.190
Let Canada take over.

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:54.610
I think Americans I'm quite disappointed.

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:56.500
I don't know what's wrong with them.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.260
They only like falsehood.

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:01.070
All the false gurus are prospering there.

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:03.190
All kinds of false things they like.

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:04.490
A lady is there.

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:10.050
She is been into lesbianism, put some sort
of a drama and they are all attracted towards

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:14.660
her, can't understand how can lesbianism anything
to do with Kundalini.

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:16.760
Kundalini doesn't understand these things.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.390
No where in the ancient books written like
this about Kundalini.

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:25.059
But this lady is out of the blue has started
using all these ticks and there are so many

00:31:25.059 --> 00:31:26.890
running after her, paying her money.

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:34.649
She has built up big, huge amount of properties
and things like that, and this is not the

00:31:34.649 --> 00:31:35.730
way to do it.

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:40.100
Why, when I say I don't take money they will
immediately ask Me then what about who pays

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:41.990
for your travel?

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:44.029
Mostly My husband pays, no doubt, he has been
paying.

00:31:44.029 --> 00:31:51.049
Well, you don't want Me to pay for your salvation,
like if I go to Russia they pay for My travel.

00:31:51.049 --> 00:31:55.420
The government pays for Me, but otherwise
wherever I go I have to pay for Myself, most

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:56.420
of the time.

00:31:56.420 --> 00:32:02.340
But even then they come to this that even
when you eat your food who pays for that?

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:03.340
It is like this.

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.770
So where they have to criticize they do not.

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:08.500
Where they don't have to criticize they criticize.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:12.360
And head along, thousands have gone to this
TM business.

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:17.970
Now this TM is another horrible thing that
has killed so many people has made them recluses.

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:22.380
I have got so many patients from there who
are suffering from all kinds of troubles.

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:28.039
But people go head along to such things which
has money you have to pay such a lot they

00:32:28.039 --> 00:32:29.539
don't mind.

00:32:29.539 --> 00:32:34.820
As I belong to another life also, you must
be knowing.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:35.820
Ah!

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:39.080
In that life, I find I just keep quiet listening
to people.

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.210
They say, "Oh!

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:45.460
That guru is good but you know he is very
expensive but he is quite good.

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:46.460
He is expensive."

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:53.799
So, a sort of a guru shopping is going on.

00:32:53.799 --> 00:32:56.520
We should not be stupid in life.

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.940
Stupidity never pays, never pays.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:00.370
We have to be alert.

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:05.130
God has given us brains to understand and
we should not waste our precious lives this

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:06.980
human life, like this.

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:14.570
I have to just tell you that I feel sometimes
so unhappy even when I went to Russia and

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:21.010
Eastern block I saw so many people getting
Realization and working it out, thousands

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:22.020
of them.

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:23.850
We don't know how to manage.

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:27.700
The government is giving us all the help,
everything still we don't know how to put

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:31.549
them up, in a big, say in a stadium, always
we have programs.

00:33:31.549 --> 00:33:38.210
So how to manage all that big group and how
to create people who will go and work it out.

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:40.390
It's such a problem for us.

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:45.820
But in the West I find people have no value
for that, no value at all.

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:51.140
It's such a beautiful life, just awaiting
at your door but we have no value, no value,

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:53.190
waste it on useless things.

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:58.039
I have to tell you as a Mother that please
be concerned about it.

00:33:58.039 --> 00:33:59.640
What's happening to our children?

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:02.980
What's happening to our families, what's happening
to our nation?

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:09.960
This Ecological problem, all these can be
solved in no time once you reach that state

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:15.269
and we have to have more people to reach that
state and to get to it.

00:34:15.269 --> 00:34:19.149
So May God bless you, in this short time whatever
was possible I have told you.

00:34:19.149 --> 00:34:23.169
I would like to also have some questions from
you but the questions should be relevant.

00:34:23.169 --> 00:34:25.179
I have not come here to take any money.

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:28.349
I have not come here to take anything from
you.

00:34:28.349 --> 00:34:30.069
I am not asking for votes.

00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:31.819
I am not a politician.

00:34:31.819 --> 00:34:33.950
I have come here to give you what you have.

00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:34.950
This is your own.

00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:39.530
This is your own property, which I have come
to give you, to tell you about it.

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:44.649
So it should be relevant and sensible and
I would like to answer your questions and

00:34:44.649 --> 00:34:49.339
then we can have the session of Realization,
which will take hardly ten minutes.

00:34:49.339 --> 00:34:51.450
So please have patience with yourself.

00:34:51.450 --> 00:34:58.040
I have lot of patience but you must have patience
and just ask Me questions which are sensible,

00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.749
not aggressive.

00:34:59.749 --> 00:35:05.479
Thank you very much.

00:35:05.479 --> 00:35:17.440
Questions and answers - (Questions can not
be heard but Shri Mataji is answering to a

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.440
question.)

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.440
Ah!

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:21.999
There is nothing to be done, just now.

00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:23.839
It will be all awakened just now.

00:35:23.839 --> 00:35:30.819
After that, once the Kundalini is awakened
you have to see where you are lacking in,

00:35:30.819 --> 00:35:38.469
what centers are not all right, which you
will yourself know.

00:35:38.469 --> 00:35:56.920
You have to come to our programs that they
have here and you have to see for yourself

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:59.759
what's wrong with you and you should correct
yourself.

00:35:59.759 --> 00:36:03.609
Then gradually you become the master.

00:36:03.609 --> 00:36:16.969
To give an analogy I'll tell you like this,
first you get into the car to learn driving,

00:36:16.969 --> 00:36:23.779
all right, so there is an accelerator and
also there is a brake.

00:36:23.779 --> 00:36:34.069
So first you start accelerator, break both
and you go I mean in every way wrong and then

00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:37.569
gradually you start improving on it.

00:36:37.569 --> 00:36:42.489
And when you improve on it you find it suddenly
that you have become a driver.

00:36:42.489 --> 00:36:43.489
Now you can drive.

00:36:43.489 --> 00:36:45.789
You can balance both the things left and right
side but still you are a driver.

00:36:45.789 --> 00:36:48.509
So there is the master sitting behind.

00:36:48.509 --> 00:36:51.450
Now that master is telling you do this, go
there, here there.

00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:59.160
Suddenly while doing all that you become the
master and when you become the master you

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:03.490
see within yourself the driver, the brake
and the accelerator and you know how to handle

00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:04.490
the whole situation.

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:05.490
It's like this.

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:12.440
So it is a gradual development within you,
which you do it and you have to come to our

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:15.729
center, carefully and pay some time, that's
all.

00:37:15.729 --> 00:37:18.059
You have to give some time.

00:37:18.059 --> 00:37:19.619
Time is very important.

00:37:19.619 --> 00:37:24.839
But is the most important because you have
to now use it for your inner development.

00:37:24.839 --> 00:37:27.430
We have watches in the hand.

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:34.230
All the time watching one minute, two minutes,
three minutes and what do we do with it?

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:36.009
Where do we spend the time?

00:37:36.009 --> 00:37:44.869
Either may be in the pub or in the ball or
maligning somebody or doing all kinds of nonsensical,

00:37:44.869 --> 00:37:46.209
destructive things.

00:37:46.209 --> 00:37:50.769
But, if we have watches, it is for what?

00:37:50.769 --> 00:37:55.119
It is for us to save time for meditation.

00:37:55.119 --> 00:38:02.369
But meditation is needed only about five-seven
minutes in the morning and ten minutes in

00:38:02.369 --> 00:38:04.779
the evening, not much time.

00:38:04.779 --> 00:38:10.359
But you must come to the collective, because
it's a happening in the collective.

00:38:10.359 --> 00:38:20.849
Like, supposing My nail is broken and I take
it out, then the body doesn't look after it.

00:38:20.849 --> 00:38:27.670
So, there is where people do not understand
and they do not come back and then they get

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:28.670
lost.

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:32.630
Next program I come in, they said, "Mother
you cured me.

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:40.719
All right, of this thing I was cured, but
now I have got this problem."

00:38:40.719 --> 00:38:47.930
So, all My life I'm curing them and all My
time is wasted like that.

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:52.630
So best thing is that you become the doctor;
you become everything.

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:54.859
Why don't you become?

00:38:54.859 --> 00:39:00.160
You all can become that; you all have that
power.

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:02.950
So you get it.

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:05.400
So you don't have to do anything just now.

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:14.390
You all have to ... I'll just tell you how
we are going to nourish our centers and we

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:17.089
are going to get our Realization.

00:39:17.089 --> 00:39:24.650
I am very happy to know that you are anxious
to do something about it.

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:27.239
May God bless you!

00:39:27.239 --> 00:39:30.479
Nice to see such people!

00:39:30.479 --> 00:39:39.809
Question: For somebody who is not here and
who is really sick, can You help them?

00:39:39.809 --> 00:39:47.279
Shri Mataji: I can, but main thing is, you
see, that such a person you can help him.

00:39:47.279 --> 00:39:48.789
First of all, you get all right.

00:39:48.789 --> 00:39:57.029
You know all about it and then you can go
and help that person, because the best thing

00:39:57.029 --> 00:40:01.009
is that your knowledge will improve as you
help that person, gradually.

00:40:01.009 --> 00:40:04.069
It's very practical, and it all helps.

00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:05.069
All right?

00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:10.359
Question: You talk about our habits and weakness
and how to overcome that.

00:40:10.359 --> 00:40:14.119
Can You talk a little bit more about it?

00:40:14.119 --> 00:40:19.249
Shri Mataji: See, we are weak because we are
ignorant first of all.

00:40:19.249 --> 00:40:26.089
As I told you, we are holding the snake and
there's darkness and in that darkness we don't

00:40:26.089 --> 00:40:41.499
see that this is going to bite us.

00:40:41.499 --> 00:41:02.069
But, when you become enlightened, you become
a very powerful, dynamic person, absolutely.

00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:05.599
And you separate yourself from your habits.

00:41:05.599 --> 00:41:08.109
You see it very clearly.

00:41:08.109 --> 00:41:13.219
Then you don't talk that "I have this habit
or that habit."

00:41:13.219 --> 00:41:15.239
You don't say like that.

00:41:15.239 --> 00:41:22.660
Like a person would come and say, "Mother,
you know, my Agnya is catching; this chakra

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:23.660
is catching.

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:26.670
That means I have too much ego."

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:29.969
But they don't say, "I have ego."

00:41:29.969 --> 00:41:37.039
I mean if you tell somebody, "You have ego,"
they'll hit you hard, isn't it?

00:41:37.039 --> 00:41:39.930
But if a person gets it, he feels it.

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:45.849
And he says, "Mother, I have too much problem
with the Agnya Chakra so please clear it up."

00:41:45.849 --> 00:41:50.779
So, if you have any habits - say supposing
there are people who used to take drugs.

00:41:50.779 --> 00:41:58.369
In the beginning I had horrible people in
England, about seven of them, all drug addicts

00:41:58.369 --> 00:41:59.650
and things.

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:07.339
Of course, very well-educated, professors
and things, but all drug addicts, hippies

00:42:07.339 --> 00:42:09.910
and violent people, really.

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:15.339
When they came to Me, it was not easy to handle
them.

00:42:15.339 --> 00:42:20.549
But they are today the foundation of Sahaja
Yoga.

00:42:20.549 --> 00:42:22.869
Wonderful people they are.

00:42:22.869 --> 00:42:30.430
Now what happened, they said, "We want to
get rid of it but we can't.

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:33.609
We just can't help it."

00:42:33.609 --> 00:42:39.559
But you will be amazed, overnight they gave
up, overnight.

00:42:39.559 --> 00:42:44.640
Just it happens because you see the light
and you throw the snake, just happens.

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.099
You don't have to think about it, just happens.

00:42:46.099 --> 00:43:02.279
I never tell them these Ten Commandments - don't
do this, don't do that.

00:43:02.279 --> 00:43:09.630
Don't tell them.

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:13.039
Just it works from within.

00:43:13.039 --> 00:43:16.769
Why should I tell them?

00:43:16.769 --> 00:43:20.380
Why should I give them a lecture?

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:21.380
There's no need.

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:29.069
They themselves become their own master and
the mastery is that the master cures and gives

00:43:29.069 --> 00:43:30.069
you powers.

00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:32.579
You develop that dignity; it's remarkable
what happens.

00:43:32.579 --> 00:43:35.839
To Me, it's not a surprise because I know
what you are.

00:43:35.839 --> 00:43:36.839
You are so glorious.

00:43:36.839 --> 00:43:38.880
It's like you take a small little, say a television
to a remote corner of India and in some village

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:44.390
and show them and say that "Here is a place,
this box will show you all the kinds of music

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:46.539
and all kinds of dramas and this."

00:43:46.539 --> 00:43:47.539
They say, "What?

00:43:47.539 --> 00:43:48.539
This box?

00:43:48.539 --> 00:43:49.579
How is it going to work out?"

00:43:49.579 --> 00:43:55.390
And, you put it to the mains and it starts
working and they say, "It's fantastic."

00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:56.390
It's like that.

00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:59.069
We are fantastic, we are glorious but we have
yet to be connected, that's all.

00:43:59.069 --> 00:44:04.829
It just happens, you don't have to force yourself,
you don't have to do anything.

00:44:04.829 --> 00:44:05.940
It just works.

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:08.150
The inner force works it out.

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:09.150
Anything else?

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:12.579
Such nice people have come today, I am very
happy.

00:44:12.579 --> 00:44:13.990
They are asking such nice questions.

00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:14.990
[Applause]

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.990
Really, wonderful!

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:18.420
But you must promise that you all will prosper
in a proper way and work it out because it's

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:19.839
a waste then I feel.

00:44:19.839 --> 00:44:25.440
You know I was so enamored by the Russians
and the Eastern Bloc people because not that

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:32.430
they only come to My lecture, not that they
only listen to Me, but they work it out.

00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:35.869
And they are moving everywhere.

00:44:35.869 --> 00:44:41.450
Now people have moved to Siberia and all these
far-fetched places.

00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:45.900
They have taken the whole map.

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:55.569
They brought the whole map before Me and said,
"Mother, now tell us where should we go."

00:44:55.569 --> 00:44:58.069
They have gone all out.

00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:59.710
So must understand the importance of it.

00:44:59.710 --> 00:45:03.039
It's not just like going to one lecture or
to another lecture.

00:45:03.039 --> 00:45:09.950
This is one thing you have to promise in your
heart that "Mother, we'll all become great

00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:10.950
trees."

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:13.499
You have such great trees here.

00:45:13.499 --> 00:45:17.059
God has created such beautiful thing here.

00:45:17.059 --> 00:45:23.160
Why not in Canada we should have some great
personalities, great saints?

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:25.200
Now, any other question?

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:32.309
Question: In order to develop realization,
if you're not living somewhere close to where

00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:35.619
there is a center then what do we do?

00:45:35.619 --> 00:45:38.900
Shri Mataji: There's no need to depend on
Me.

00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:45.200
We have people here who are experts, who have
really become masters.

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:48.039
And, they will definitely help you so it doesn't
matter.

00:45:48.039 --> 00:45:49.470
I am always with you.

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:54.900
Whenever you think of Me, you'll know I am
with you and you can always write to Me.

00:45:54.900 --> 00:46:00.290
There's nothing to feel that I'm away from
you, that ... maybe that is the reason people

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:02.079
don't go further with it.

00:46:02.079 --> 00:46:04.569
But as you trust Me, you trust yourself.

00:46:04.569 --> 00:46:05.789
You must trust yourself.

00:46:05.789 --> 00:46:09.420
You must have faith in yourself that you are
quite capable and you can do it.

00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:14.319
You can do it and that there are people who
will help you.

00:46:14.319 --> 00:46:18.319
They are very humble, sweet, beautiful people.

00:46:18.319 --> 00:46:23.150
You will like them and they'll all help you
till you become perfect.

00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:25.150
Such love, I tell you.

00:46:25.150 --> 00:46:26.749
Same thing [someone interrupts].

00:46:26.749 --> 00:46:27.749
Children?

00:46:27.749 --> 00:46:29.619
Children are the best, children are the best
for Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:29.619 --> 00:46:31.650
They take to Sahaja Yoga in no time.

00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:37.599
Most of the children these days are born realized
and we have to just understand them.

00:46:37.599 --> 00:46:41.269
So many children are born realized.

00:46:41.269 --> 00:46:50.569
Children are the best to understand Sahaja
Yoga, to work it out and they just of a very

00:46:50.569 --> 00:46:53.319
high level, I should say.

00:46:53.319 --> 00:47:07.140
Like the other day there was a child who was
receiving a phone.

00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:27.210
He said, "Oh, it's all right.

00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:39.299
You are not a yogi."

00:47:39.299 --> 00:47:46.529
Puts it down the phone.

00:47:46.529 --> 00:47:53.749
So I said, "How do you know?"

00:47:53.749 --> 00:47:56.130
"Mother, he had no vibrations.

00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:57.859
How could I know?

00:47:57.859 --> 00:48:00.459
Why should I talk to him?

00:48:00.459 --> 00:48:03.920
Let it be, I put down the phone."

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:08.000
Question: Mother, is it a symbol of Your photograph
that gives vibrations?

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.349
The willpower [can't understand the rest of
the question]

00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:12.999
Shri Mataji: It's true.

00:48:12.999 --> 00:48:17.849
My photograph luckily has some sort of a coefficience
that it emits vibrations.

00:48:17.849 --> 00:48:24.509
I mean, I would like anybody else's photograph
if it does, because it's a good idea; but

00:48:24.509 --> 00:48:30.180
I don't think there's anyone like that, because
none of the incarnations and none of the saints

00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:31.180
were photographed.

00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:32.249
It's very surprising, nobody was photographed.

00:48:32.249 --> 00:48:38.309
At the most, and also, nobody was portrayed
in their lifetime, because you know what happened

00:48:38.309 --> 00:48:41.329
to all the saints and to all the incarnations:
when they lived, everybody was after their

00:48:41.329 --> 00:48:42.329
lives.

00:48:42.329 --> 00:48:43.329
No question of having so many people.

00:48:43.329 --> 00:48:46.549
I mean, even Christ had hardly twelve people
and how they tortured His life!

00:48:46.549 --> 00:48:56.089
Actually, if you see His public life, He lived
hardly for three and a half years and they

00:48:56.089 --> 00:48:57.119
crucified Him.

00:48:57.119 --> 00:49:00.729
So, this is what the world was.

00:49:00.729 --> 00:49:03.309
It's not so bad now.

00:49:03.309 --> 00:49:10.519
I mean, nobody is going to crucify Me, but
still there were no photographs.

00:49:10.519 --> 00:49:16.579
So, the modern times has another advantage
that they have photographs, and they will

00:49:16.579 --> 00:49:21.789
show you lots of beautiful photographs and
things which will stun you.

00:49:21.789 --> 00:49:25.709
But that will be later on, you can see.

00:49:25.709 --> 00:49:30.219
But even this is such an advantage that I
can talk to so many people.

00:49:30.219 --> 00:49:47.829
And aeroplane is such an advantage that I
can travel all over the world.

00:49:47.829 --> 00:50:03.849
Everything is such an advantage today.

00:50:03.849 --> 00:50:10.949
The communication have improved so much that
I could come to Canada.

00:50:10.949 --> 00:50:12.449
Can you imagine Christ coming to Canada?

00:50:12.449 --> 00:50:13.449
[Laughter]

00:50:13.449 --> 00:50:17.609
So, I mean, see the whole advantage is there
and in Russia I have given realization to

00:50:17.609 --> 00:50:19.279
people on television, on television.

00:50:19.279 --> 00:50:21.950
But they are extremely sensitive people, extremely
sensitive.

00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:28.819
I mean, in the program when we had the scientists,
one of the scientist got up and said, "But

00:50:28.819 --> 00:50:35.279
Mother, please tell us how You cure people
when they only attend Your program when they

00:50:35.279 --> 00:50:36.489
are so many."

00:50:36.489 --> 00:50:40.109
I said, "I don't know if I've cure people."

00:50:40.109 --> 00:50:42.130
But they are so sensitive.

00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:44.150
Their spirituality is just there.

00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:45.759
It touches so fast.

00:50:45.759 --> 00:50:49.069
We can say that they are very, very ultra-modern
sensitive instruments.

00:50:49.069 --> 00:50:50.650
Just touch them and it works.

00:50:50.650 --> 00:50:51.650
It's rather surprising.

00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:53.079
Their attention is so good.

00:50:53.079 --> 00:50:55.390
Their attention is so good.

00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:58.619
So, that's what it is, it works.

00:50:58.619 --> 00:51:03.229
But if they can get it, you can get it.

00:51:03.229 --> 00:51:05.079
You can do it.

00:51:05.079 --> 00:51:07.099
But also, another problem in the West is that
we are very guilty people.

00:51:07.099 --> 00:51:10.920
For nothing at all, we are extremely - one
side we are destroying ourselves, that's one

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:16.609
way and another is all the time we feel, 'I've
done this wrong.

00:51:16.609 --> 00:51:17.900
I've done that wrong.

00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:18.940
Sorry, Sorry!'

00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:20.559
English language is full of it.

00:51:20.559 --> 00:51:21.849
So, we all the time start feeling sorry.

00:51:21.849 --> 00:51:25.549
There's no need to feel all that guilt and
sin and all this nonsensical ideas.

00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:28.410
That really spoils the game for Me also.

00:51:28.410 --> 00:51:31.819
I have seen Americans are the worst.

00:51:31.819 --> 00:51:40.900
They are guilty for this and guilty for that.

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:44.219
What is there to be guilty?

00:51:44.219 --> 00:51:52.079
After all, you are human beings and if you
have done any mistakes, doesn't matter.

00:51:52.079 --> 00:51:54.039
After all you're not Gods.

00:51:54.039 --> 00:51:55.039
So what?

00:51:55.039 --> 00:51:58.359
If you have done mistakes, all right forget
it.

00:51:58.359 --> 00:51:59.539
Forget the past.

00:51:59.539 --> 00:52:04.680
But this is also another problem of the West
is: now their forefathers say came here and

00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:05.970
killed some Red Indians.

00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:10.470
Now, the forefathers are finished, they might
have become Red Indians in this lifetime.

00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:11.509
They are not there.

00:52:11.509 --> 00:52:13.799
You are their children's children's children's
children.

00:52:13.799 --> 00:52:17.199
Now why are you carrying on the jokes so far?

00:52:17.199 --> 00:52:22.529
But for everything they feel guilty - is another
such a mental nonsense that please, before

00:52:22.529 --> 00:52:27.910
I start this program, I have to request you
that don't feel guilty for anything.

00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:29.770
You have done nothing wrong.

00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:33.510
[Shri Mataji speaks aside] Also, there is
another two-three people.

00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:39.549
Question: Is Gorbachev is a walk-in, which
means that is he from some other place which

00:52:39.549 --> 00:52:40.549
is advanced soul?

00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:44.039
Shri Mataji: He is a realized soul, no doubt,
he is.

00:52:44.039 --> 00:52:45.640
That's why it's working out.

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.240
He knows Me very well.

00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:48.849
He is a realized soul.

00:52:48.849 --> 00:52:52.160
That you recognized him, I'm very happy to
know that.

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:55.259
He is and look at them, how lucky they are
to have him there.

00:52:55.259 --> 00:52:58.579
And, he is a very sensible man, no doubt.

00:52:58.579 --> 00:52:59.579
Even Lenin was.

00:52:59.579 --> 00:53:04.380
Lenin was a realized soul, you will be surprised,
but he was forced by all his party members.

00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:06.319
He was alone, you see.

00:53:06.319 --> 00:53:19.079
And, all of them forced him to take a course
of line which was really proved later on.

00:53:19.079 --> 00:53:37.420
But whatever was his state, talked about stateless
state and all that was his dream and that's

00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:39.569
coming true.

00:53:39.569 --> 00:53:44.109
He was also a realized soul.

00:53:44.109 --> 00:53:50.599
But he went onto a wrong line and it took
so much time for them to come back and they

00:53:50.599 --> 00:53:54.689
had horrible despotic people, no doubt but
the way the Gorbachev is doing is great and

00:53:54.689 --> 00:54:01.439
I have a rapport with him and he is a very
great man, I must say.

00:54:01.439 --> 00:54:04.880
And he has tremendous respect for Me.

00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:10.050
Because we are of the same style, you can
say, the same line, that's why.

00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:11.939
You, too, had in America.

00:54:11.939 --> 00:54:16.079
You had, say, Abraham Lincoln was a realized
soul, no doubt.

00:54:16.079 --> 00:54:17.969
And, we had Mahatma Gandhi.

00:54:17.969 --> 00:54:20.579
We had many people, but they were singled
out.

00:54:20.579 --> 00:54:22.400
They couldn't give realizations to others.

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:27.199
They were singled out and they had to fight,
but now you all can become realized souls.

00:54:27.199 --> 00:54:32.150
We have to have many more to get peace, to
get joy, to get what we deserve.

00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:36.170
[Question: A lady seems to have some illness
that doctors can't diagnose and is asking

00:54:36.170 --> 00:54:37.819
if Shri Mataji can help.]

00:54:37.819 --> 00:54:39.470
Shri Mataji: Yes, that's true.

00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:41.119
I am Myself a doctor.

00:54:41.119 --> 00:54:42.450
I've done medicine, Myself.

00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:43.450
I know that.

00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:46.740
It's difficult for them because they cannot
raise the Kundalini.

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:48.420
You see that's the problem is.

00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:50.480
Please sit down, I'll tell you.

00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:55.439
The medical science is, of course has reached
a quite a lot of height and have understood

00:54:55.439 --> 00:55:02.420
anything, but the problem with the medical
line is this: that when a tree is sick, you

00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:07.059
see, we treat the leaves but we cannot get
to the roots, you see.

00:55:07.059 --> 00:55:18.219
But Sahaja Yoga is a thing that gets to the
roots, and I'm not telling you off-hand, you

00:55:18.219 --> 00:55:22.579
see, there are three doctors who got their
Ph.D. in India in Sahaja Yoga that they have

00:55:22.579 --> 00:55:23.579
cured people.

00:55:23.579 --> 00:55:28.599
There are seven doctors in London who are
now writing down about how many people have

00:55:28.599 --> 00:55:30.630
been cured with Sahaja Yoga.

00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:36.059
But the problem is like this: like for in
America, I cannot cure people because I will

00:55:36.059 --> 00:55:37.059
be arrested.

00:55:37.059 --> 00:55:39.960
If and if Christ goes there, He will be arrested.

00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:44.019
The medical science doesn't allow there, I
mean, that anybody should cure anyone.

00:55:44.019 --> 00:55:49.890
Now, the problem is if you come to India nobody
is allowed to come to India who suffers with

00:55:49.890 --> 00:55:52.049
AIDS and all such diseases.

00:55:52.049 --> 00:55:54.650
Big problem for the patient also.

00:55:54.650 --> 00:55:57.412
Even in England, you see, if we cannot say
that we can cure them, lots of problems with

00:55:57.412 --> 00:55:58.412
the law.

00:55:58.412 --> 00:55:59.412
And, we cannot.

00:55:59.412 --> 00:56:04.289
But only thing those who get cured automatically,
like we have the people who are Sahaja Yogis

00:56:04.289 --> 00:56:10.259
who had diseases, they have got their papers,
everything, and then they are cured, then

00:56:10.259 --> 00:56:12.640
we note it down.

00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:18.519
India is the only place where I can start
this curing business.

00:56:18.519 --> 00:56:22.049
But to be very frank, we are not in this business.

00:56:22.049 --> 00:56:24.119
We are not in the business of curing.

00:56:24.119 --> 00:56:29.130
What we are doing is to raise your Kundalini
by which you get cured as a by-product.

00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:31.309
We are not doing curing.

00:56:31.309 --> 00:56:33.130
That's not our job.

00:56:33.130 --> 00:56:35.229
That's not what we do.

00:56:35.229 --> 00:56:39.859
And, also I must tell you the Divinity has
common sense.

00:56:39.859 --> 00:56:46.039
A common sense in the sense that: now these
lights are here, we know that particular bulb

00:56:46.039 --> 00:56:47.819
is not going to work.

00:56:47.819 --> 00:56:49.589
So nobody wants to cure.

00:56:49.589 --> 00:56:55.609
The Divine doesn't want to cure people who
are not going to give lights, who are not

00:56:55.609 --> 00:56:57.369
going to get to Sahaja Yoga, means that their
Kundalini doesn't rise.

00:56:57.369 --> 00:56:59.789
If their Kundalini doesn't rise, then how
can we cure?

00:56:59.789 --> 00:57:01.559
That's the only way we can cure people.

00:57:01.559 --> 00:57:07.079
So there are limitations also that your Kundalini
has to rise and then you can get cured.

00:57:07.079 --> 00:57:09.319
But there are many miracles which have happened.

00:57:09.319 --> 00:57:11.279
I don't know how people got cured.

00:57:11.279 --> 00:57:13.519
And there have been many cures, no doubt.

00:57:13.519 --> 00:57:16.699
And, it sounds very, very much fantastic that
it can be cured through Kundalini awakening

00:57:16.699 --> 00:57:17.699
but it has happened.

00:57:17.699 --> 00:57:18.699
We have to accept the truth.

00:57:18.699 --> 00:57:22.469
As long as it helps, what does it matter?

00:57:22.469 --> 00:57:23.469
Yes, please?

00:57:23.469 --> 00:57:27.069
Question: What would be the effect of increasing
number of Sahaja Yogis on the economic system

00:57:27.069 --> 00:57:33.219
and the lifestyle of the country where the
increase of Sahaja Yogis takes place?

00:57:33.219 --> 00:57:35.839
Shri Mataji: Oh, it just triggers everything.

00:57:35.839 --> 00:57:38.769
For example, now what are our problems?

00:57:38.769 --> 00:57:44.650
We see the economic problems of this country
is.

00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:53.699
I have understood it so well that we have
so much of a, say, ores and all other things

00:57:53.699 --> 00:58:00.619
like silver we have here, and gold and all
kinds of things we have, and the ones who

00:58:00.619 --> 00:58:04.529
are exploiting us are Americans and nobody
sees the point.

00:58:04.529 --> 00:58:05.599
Nobody sees the point.

00:58:05.599 --> 00:58:08.339
While those who will get Sahaja Yogis, they
will become so dynamic.

00:58:08.339 --> 00:58:12.819
They will put in their own industries here.

00:58:12.819 --> 00:58:14.499
Why send it?

00:58:14.499 --> 00:58:17.289
Why make cars in America?

00:58:17.289 --> 00:58:20.089
Why not make them here?

00:58:20.089 --> 00:58:27.940
So many things can happen because you become
so dynamic and there's so many people to help

00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:29.990
you all over that this is what should happen.

00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:33.539
After all, you have all kinds of things available
here.

00:58:33.539 --> 00:58:39.569
Why should you send your aluminum to America,
to be drawn into wires and beaten into sheets?

00:58:39.569 --> 00:58:40.630
There's no need.

00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:42.410
We can do it ourselves.

00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:46.960
So this, you see, self-confidence that we
can do it together and the collective feeling

00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:48.819
can give you such good ideas.

00:58:48.819 --> 00:58:53.769
And another point is that the way we are working
out machines now.

00:58:53.769 --> 00:58:56.650
Now we have to understand that machines are
for us.

00:58:56.650 --> 00:59:03.699
We have created machines and machines are
to be used according to our need and we are

00:59:03.699 --> 00:59:05.239
not for machines.

00:59:05.239 --> 00:59:08.329
They are not to dominate us.

00:59:08.329 --> 00:59:15.519
So as much as we need we'll use machines otherwise
we'll not use machines.

00:59:15.519 --> 00:59:22.759
And as a result, already it is happening that
people don't like machine-made things and

00:59:22.759 --> 00:59:23.759
machine-made this thing.

00:59:23.759 --> 00:59:27.859
So they will go to the balancing state where
they will take to more handmade things and

00:59:27.859 --> 00:59:28.859
handmade material.

00:59:28.859 --> 00:59:33.740
Now for a handmade things you don't have to
have so many.

00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:39.799
Like, now we say in India, thank God, we are
quite poor country, we can't afford to have

00:59:39.799 --> 00:59:40.809
so many machines.

00:59:40.809 --> 00:59:46.869
Thank God for that because now in a household
they will have about, say, ten plates of brass

00:59:46.869 --> 00:59:48.549
or twelve plates of brass.

00:59:48.549 --> 00:59:49.549
Finished.

00:59:49.549 --> 00:59:53.259
We don't have to have so many crockery, cutlery,
this, that, that breaks.

00:59:53.259 --> 00:59:55.660
Then, after that you have plastic.

00:59:55.660 --> 01:00:02.680
Because it breaks so you have plastics.

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:06.689
So, you go on.

01:00:06.689 --> 01:00:12.969
The plastic is now mounting up, mountains
after mountains we have created.

01:00:12.969 --> 01:00:16.289
So, you take more to practical side, very
much practical and more to the natural.

01:00:16.289 --> 01:00:20.089
And in natural, it's nice to have one natural
thing than to have ten plastics.

01:00:20.089 --> 01:00:24.209
Now people are realizing, I'm not saying they
are not realizing it.

01:00:24.209 --> 01:00:27.309
But still there are machines sitting on top
of us.

01:00:27.309 --> 01:00:30.420
And then the entrepreneurs, the entrepreneurs
are very clever.

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:34.569
Today they start one fashions, tomorrow another
fashion, third day third fashion.

01:00:34.569 --> 01:00:37.160
England is another one who suffers a lot.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:41.789
For example, in a place like London, which
is such a cold place, people have pants which

01:00:41.789 --> 01:00:43.309
have holes in it.

01:00:43.309 --> 01:00:45.179
They call it holy pants, you see.

01:00:45.179 --> 01:00:49.039
And now imagine, they developed varicose veins
with that.

01:00:49.039 --> 01:00:51.189
Or they'll have tight pants.

01:00:51.189 --> 01:00:52.579
They have to do something about it.

01:00:52.579 --> 01:00:54.289
They have to feed their machines.

01:00:54.289 --> 01:00:57.349
So they will start this fashion or that fashion.

01:00:57.349 --> 01:01:02.450
Now, there's another fashion which is also
very dangerous that people don't put any oil

01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:03.470
in their hair.

01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:09.119
Before taking a head bath, one can put easily
some oil or before night they can put it.

01:01:09.119 --> 01:01:10.640
They are all getting bald.

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:13.390
Once they get bald, them they'll sell their
wigs.

01:01:13.390 --> 01:01:16.859
The same hair which are fallen off, they make
wigs and sell it.

01:01:16.859 --> 01:01:17.859
They are befooling you.

01:01:17.859 --> 01:01:22.990
If you see little bit, you stand out and see
how they are befooling you must, these entrepreneurs

01:01:22.990 --> 01:01:23.990
are.

01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:27.490
This is the fashion today, that is the fashion.

01:01:27.490 --> 01:01:32.839
I was seeing the children, we are now producing
clothes for children, for example.

01:01:32.839 --> 01:01:35.009
The clothes are such horrible clothes.

01:01:35.009 --> 01:01:36.559
I mean, they call them...

01:01:36.559 --> 01:01:41.369
[Shri Mataji asks someone in Hindi, "What
do they call such clothes now-a-days?"]

01:01:41.369 --> 01:01:42.499
... trendy, trendy clothes.

01:01:42.499 --> 01:01:44.019
Children wear trendy clothes.

01:01:44.019 --> 01:01:46.660
They have no respect, respect for themselves.

01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:48.179
They don't respect themselves.

01:01:48.179 --> 01:01:55.519
If you give them trendy clothes, you see,
they become like brats, and then you say they

01:01:55.519 --> 01:01:56.849
are brats.

01:01:56.849 --> 01:02:01.539
You make them brats from very childhood.

01:02:01.539 --> 01:02:06.490
You want them to be brats, you see.

01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:09.940
So,the whole system changes.

01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:15.119
Children become so beautiful, so dignified.

01:02:15.119 --> 01:02:25.480
Dress makes a person understand what is his
personality is, isn't it?

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:34.709
If you are just sort of careless about everything,
you are not bothered and the way - I have

01:02:34.709 --> 01:02:41.890
seen also children and even the grown-ups
walk as if you see the, it doesn't matter

01:02:41.890 --> 01:02:49.950
how you walk, you throw your legs this side,
hands like that.

01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:58.289
That shows the personality, that this personality
has no sense of dignity - how it has to walk,

01:02:58.289 --> 01:03:01.329
how they have to talk or things.

01:03:01.329 --> 01:03:05.240
So the whole thing has come down.

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:08.960
Now, for example, English language now.

01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:18.150
I never studied English language but when
I went to England, I was surprised the kind

01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:20.469
of English they are speaking.

01:03:20.469 --> 01:03:25.660
I mean, you don't know what sort of English
they are speaking.

01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:27.329
And, really is impossible.

01:03:27.329 --> 01:03:39.940
At least, in Canada people speak better English,
I tell you.

01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:49.239
You'll have a language problem, really.

01:03:49.239 --> 01:04:01.029
Because they, even people from Cambridge,
they have developed such funny, funny intonations

01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:05.999
and funny pronunciation that it's impossible
to cope with them.

01:04:05.999 --> 01:04:12.109
So this is what I'm trying to tell you: that
once you get this balance, once you get this

01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:16.680
knowledge, you develop a balanced economy,
you develop a balanced ecology, you develop

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:19.859
everything in balance because all these imbalances
has come through human beings.

01:04:19.859 --> 01:04:21.969
What is the source is a human being.

01:04:21.969 --> 01:04:25.130
You see, in the jungle if you go there's no
imbalance.

01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:27.490
Only where human beings live there's imbalance.

01:04:27.490 --> 01:04:33.719
So once you get into balance, when you have
more Sahaja Yogis, there will be more balance

01:04:33.719 --> 01:04:37.499
and you'll be surprised how things will work
out.

01:04:37.499 --> 01:04:42.819
And, above all there is this Divine Power
which is going to help you.

01:04:42.819 --> 01:04:45.400
Now, what do you want again?

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:47.549
Question: Can we meditate now?

01:04:47.549 --> 01:04:53.680
Now, I hope you are finished with your questions,
because if you finish with questions it's

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:56.700
better because this mind, you know, is a funny
thing.

01:04:56.700 --> 01:05:01.229
Suddenly, you're meditating, suddenly a thing
will come, "Oh, I should have asked this question

01:05:01.229 --> 01:05:02.229
to Mother!"

01:05:02.229 --> 01:05:07.900
But as she says it's true that even if I answer
all your questions, it's a mental acrobat.

01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:10.549
I can answer all your questions very well.

01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:18.220
I am good at it, but it is not going to raise
your Kundalini.

01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:24.369
So no question, is better that you just see
that what happens because it's a happening

01:05:24.369 --> 01:05:25.640
within yourself.

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:27.349
It takes you without thinking about it.

01:05:27.349 --> 01:05:31.569
It takes you beyond the state where you become
thoughtlessly aware.

01:05:31.569 --> 01:05:34.660
You are aware but the thoughts absolutely
subside.

01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:44.249
And then ultimately you feel a cool breeze
coming out of your head and you feel cool

01:05:44.249 --> 01:05:47.539
breeze all around you.

01:05:47.539 --> 01:05:52.420
This is what has to happen.

01:05:52.420 --> 01:06:00.209
And I'm very happy that she has pointed out
that they are all waiting for it.

01:06:00.209 --> 01:06:03.349
And, there's no end to these talks and things.

01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:08.969
So, if you have any questions you may write
to Me or you may give Me in writing, if you

01:06:08.969 --> 01:06:11.209
feel that it is such an important question.

01:06:11.209 --> 01:06:18.689
Then, of course, these people will definitely
try to give you an answer for that.

01:06:18.689 --> 01:06:25.449
Now, I have I think in thousands My lectures
are there and the tapes are available.

01:06:25.449 --> 01:06:32.809
But we do not give people the lectures and
the books and things because once it starts

01:06:32.809 --> 01:06:35.729
the mental activity they just run into that.

01:06:35.729 --> 01:06:42.880
So, first of all develop yourself internally
into that abstract stage and then if you read,

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.369
it has some meaning.

01:06:44.369 --> 01:06:51.279
Otherwise, there are people who know everything
about Sahaja Yoga but they can't do anything

01:06:51.279 --> 01:06:52.279
about it.

01:06:52.279 --> 01:06:54.499
Still there are two persons.

01:06:54.499 --> 01:06:58.049
Now these are the last two persons, all right?

01:06:58.049 --> 01:06:59.589
Now, what's it madam?

01:06:59.589 --> 01:07:04.349
Question: When do you feel the throbbing feeling
when the Kundalini rises, when pulsation is

01:07:04.349 --> 01:07:05.349
there?

01:07:05.349 --> 01:07:12.319
You see, actually, Kundalini is in this jet
age has become like a jet Kundalini.

01:07:12.319 --> 01:07:18.669
She just rises, She doesn't give you much
throbbing or anything - normally, normally

01:07:18.669 --> 01:07:19.669
I'm saying.

01:07:19.669 --> 01:07:25.049
But if you have some troubles, some diseases,
something, some obstructions, then it does

01:07:25.049 --> 01:07:26.259
throb a little.

01:07:26.259 --> 01:07:33.109
But you can feel it nicely on your head the
cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone

01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:36.079
area, very nicely, you see it, you feel it.

01:07:36.079 --> 01:07:47.119
So it is the throbbing of the Kundalini and
all that are just like some sort of an obstructions

01:07:47.119 --> 01:07:52.440
or say, short circuiting but that can be corrected
very easily.

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:57.930
So, it's like a very nicely built, very efficiently
built aeroplane, has a very smooth landing,

01:07:57.930 --> 01:07:59.990
like that Kundalini rises very beautifully.

01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:04.079
And, this is the blessing of the modern times,
I think, that the Kundalini works out that

01:08:04.079 --> 01:08:05.509
way.

01:08:05.509 --> 01:08:07.700
There's one more, there was one gentleman.

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:13.039
Question: The question is that once the Kundalini
is awaken he's read that Kundalini can be

01:08:13.039 --> 01:08:18.580
if uncontrolled, if you don't know how to
control it, can it harm you?

01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:21.620
You see, these books are written by people
who have no idea of Kundalini.

01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:23.159
It's not like that.

01:08:23.159 --> 01:08:25.889
You see, this is just to sell something.

01:08:25.889 --> 01:08:26.889
It's marketing.

01:08:26.889 --> 01:08:28.900
Sell anything, any nonsense, there's nothing.

01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:30.400
She is your Mother.

01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:35.289
She is your individual Mother who's waiting
to give you your second birth.

01:08:35.289 --> 01:08:37.170
Why will She trouble you?

01:08:37.170 --> 01:08:42.809
When you got your birth, your mother looked
after everything, she, poor thing, went through

01:08:42.809 --> 01:08:48.049
all the labor pains and everything, she didn't
allow you to suffer anything, she never wanted

01:08:48.049 --> 01:08:49.049
you to suffer.

01:08:49.049 --> 01:08:50.049
Did she?

01:08:50.049 --> 01:08:56.450
Then this is a pure Mother, your own individual
Mother; She knows each and everything about

01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:57.450
you.

01:08:57.450 --> 01:09:04.000
It's all recorded in Her and She is not going
to trouble you, and you are going to be controlled

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.759
by Her in such a manner that She becomes your
energy.

01:09:08.759 --> 01:09:10.469
She helps you.

01:09:10.469 --> 01:09:19.039
So, all these false ideas people have given,
written books after books so that they can

01:09:19.039 --> 01:09:20.039
sell it.

01:09:20.039 --> 01:09:21.299
I haven't written any books so far.

01:09:21.299 --> 01:09:23.809
You'll be surprised, I've not written any
books so far.

01:09:23.809 --> 01:09:26.079
Twenty years have past, I've written no books
whatsoever.

01:09:26.079 --> 01:09:29.599
People have written about Me, people have
written about Sahaja Yoga, they have written

01:09:29.599 --> 01:09:34.929
all this, but I have not yet written.

01:09:34.929 --> 01:09:39.560
I'll be writing.

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:50.869
I hope so I get some time to write.

01:09:50.869 --> 01:09:54.170
But you see, what is important is that whatever
written can be all nonsense.

01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:58.490
They can write anything about anything.

01:09:58.490 --> 01:10:04.139
First of all, you should know what it is.

01:10:04.139 --> 01:10:08.139
And now I have been going to various places,
I have not seen it misbehaving anywhere or

01:10:08.139 --> 01:10:09.440
doing any harm to anybody.

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:17.699
Of course, sometimes you do feel little heat
in the body, that's all.

01:10:17.699 --> 01:10:29.800
That's the thing you feel little heat on your
hands, that's all.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:33.800
But it's so little that it's negligible.

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:35.200
So, be confident.

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:47.650
First of all, before starting I have to tell
you few things and one of them is that have

01:10:47.650 --> 01:10:48.650
faith in yourself.

01:10:48.650 --> 01:10:54.469
Have faith that you all are capable of getting
your Self-realization.

01:10:54.469 --> 01:10:57.329
Please have that faith in yourself.

01:10:57.329 --> 01:11:04.640
You have faith in everything else but in yourself,
that's wrong.

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:07.280
Please have faith in yourself.

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:09.630
That is first point.

01:11:09.630 --> 01:11:14.510
Now there are two conditions we have to fulfill
before we get our realization.

01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:21.870
First condition is I have already told you,
that not to feel guilty, forget the past.

01:11:21.870 --> 01:11:28.550
Not to feel guilty is very important because
when you feel guilty, then the center here

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:35.010
on the left side catches, Vishuddhi as they
call it, and it's the worst thing that can

01:11:35.010 --> 01:11:40.719
happen because this is the center when it
catches you get spondylitis, you get angina,

01:11:40.719 --> 01:11:43.580
all kinds of trouble with this center.

01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:48.920
But the worst thing is that the Kundalini
cannot rise above this center.

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:52.880
So, not to feel guilty.

01:11:52.880 --> 01:12:00.060
I assure you that you have done nothing wrong.

01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:02.260
You see, there are so many norms a society
has created.

01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:08.750
Even if you put the fork on the other side
you start thinking, "Oh God, what did I do?"

01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:15.869
You feel you are not sophisticated or you
have done something like a murder.

01:12:15.869 --> 01:12:17.389
It's not that.

01:12:17.389 --> 01:12:24.369
It is just all these norms are artificially
created, all these are artificial things.

01:12:24.369 --> 01:12:30.239
Somebody is very thin, he thinks, "Why should
I be thin?"

01:12:30.239 --> 01:12:35.039
Somebody's fat, he says, "Why should I be
fat?"

01:12:35.039 --> 01:12:42.909
But this is life's, whatever is there we have
to accept our life as it is and there's nothing

01:12:42.909 --> 01:12:44.110
wrong in it.

01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:45.110
Nothing guilt.

01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:50.900
Whatever is there, whatever we have been doing,
we have been doing as human beings.

01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:57.719
So, first and foremost condition is - absolutely
you cannot compromise on that - is that you

01:12:57.719 --> 01:13:00.180
are not to feel guilty at all.

01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:01.820
Immediately, you'll feel better.

01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:06.920
All right, the second one is that you have
to forgive everyone, forgive everyone because

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:09.699
whether you forgive or you don't forgive,
you don't do anything.

01:13:09.699 --> 01:13:18.550
You are living with a myth, all the time thinking,
"Oh, I have to forgive this person, I have

01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:20.489
to forgive that person."

01:13:20.489 --> 01:13:23.889
There's no need to think like that.

01:13:23.889 --> 01:13:34.829
You don't also have to think about any individual,
just in general you have to say, "I forgive

01:13:34.829 --> 01:13:36.429
everyone of them."

01:13:36.429 --> 01:13:45.330
And, that clears out this center, very clearly,
this is the center of Christ, this clears

01:13:45.330 --> 01:13:51.000
out, and it's very easy for Me because this
is a very constricted, it's the gate to the

01:13:51.000 --> 01:14:01.780
limbic area so that gate has to be widened
and it has to be opened out.

01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:03.930
And so, just forgive everyone.

01:14:03.930 --> 01:14:07.310
And, you know it is a myth.

01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:09.780
You are playing into the wrong hands.

01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:13.100
So, this is another condition, you have to
just accept.

01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:18.409
Then it's easier for Me to work it out and
easier for you to get it.

01:14:18.409 --> 01:14:19.860
So, first is just don't feel guilty.

01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:22.480
If you don't forgive, you won't feel it.

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:26.070
Then, you will come and say, "Mother, I didn't
feel it."

01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:29.659
And then I'll have to say, "All right, forgive,
forgive, forgive."

01:14:29.659 --> 01:14:31.300
And then you'll feel it.

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:32.719
So, what's the use?

01:14:32.719 --> 01:14:41.409
Just better do what I've told you, is very
simple thing, just forgive everyone in general.

01:14:41.409 --> 01:14:49.980
Then there are certain simple things: that
we have to take help of the Mother Earth.

01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:57.199
Now those who are sitting in the ground are
the best placed, that's all right, they can

01:14:57.199 --> 01:15:10.390
just take out their shoes, so they're not,
it's better that their feet are a little open

01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:11.390
out.

01:15:11.390 --> 01:15:16.900
And, all of you should have to take your feet
out, it helps a lot.

01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:22.579
Those who are sitting, should sit more cross-legged
it's better, better to sit cross legged.

01:15:22.579 --> 01:15:28.250
It's hardly will take any time and is ... you
don't have to fight with your thoughts, you

01:15:28.250 --> 01:15:31.059
don't have to stop your thoughts, nothing,
it just works automatically.

01:15:31.059 --> 01:15:35.440
I would say, like your attention is like this
saree.

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:43.530
Now, the Kundalini rises like this, goes up
and She pushes all your attention inside automatically

01:15:43.530 --> 01:15:48.139
and then when it pierces through here, then
the grace starts falling on your attention,

01:15:48.139 --> 01:15:50.030
on your sympathetic nervous system and it
soothes down.

01:15:50.030 --> 01:15:52.889
Then, your centers open more and more threads
of Kundalini rise.

01:15:52.889 --> 01:16:00.760
So, this is what is today's modern Sahaja
Yoga, which somehow or other I've managed

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:07.239
to discover, that let few threads of Kundalini
rise to begin with so that you open your chakras

01:16:07.239 --> 01:16:09.190
gradually, and then more and more.

01:16:09.190 --> 01:16:11.940
And then one day I find you all have become
great gurus, great personalities.

01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:13.110
So, may God bless you all!

01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:18.520
So, let us now with all respect to ourselves,
with all love for ourselves, we have to have

01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:20.159
complete faith in ourselves, complete faith.

01:16:20.159 --> 01:16:21.159
Have complete self confidence.

01:16:21.159 --> 01:16:23.099
Now please put both your hands like this.

01:16:23.099 --> 01:16:26.530
It's important to understand that these five,
six and seven are the sympathetic nervous

01:16:26.530 --> 01:16:27.530
system endings and this side also are, these
are sympathetic nervous system endings and

01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:30.420
they are the ones who are expressing the centers
within ourselves.

01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:34.200
Like this, left and right meet and make one
center.

01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:41.080
So, is very important that you, we have to
put both the hands like this to begin with.

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:49.070
You can, now somebody will show you how we
are going to nourish our centers.

01:16:49.070 --> 01:16:54.920
The left side represents our desire, not the
pure desire, but our desire.

01:16:54.920 --> 01:17:07.870
And the right side represents our action,
power of action.

01:17:07.870 --> 01:17:14.989
So, we will be using our power of action to
nourish our centers, while the left hand will

01:17:14.989 --> 01:17:16.940
be all the time towards Myself.

01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:23.200
Before closing your eyes, you can also take
out your spectacles because this helps eyesight

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:24.200
also.

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:33.719
So before, not now, just now when I tell to,
because just now I'll show you how to do it

01:17:33.719 --> 01:17:37.320
and then we'll close our eyes.

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.280
So somebody will show you.

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:43.580
First of all, you put your left hand toward
Me like this.

01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:50.670
Of course, those who don't want to do it,
should go because it is proper not to disturb

01:17:50.670 --> 01:17:51.670
others.

01:17:51.670 --> 01:17:59.719
You see, nobody should, those who do not want
to do should try to do it because it's not

01:17:59.719 --> 01:18:07.349
proper and should not disturb others in between
to get up and walk out.

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:12.640
So, now please put your left hand towards
Me like this.

01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:16.820
And, with the right hand we nourish our centers.

01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:20.550
So, first we put it on our heart.

01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:25.670
In the heart, resides the Spirit, is reflected
in the Spirit.

01:18:25.670 --> 01:18:41.469
Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty and
Kundalini is the reflection of the primordial

01:18:41.469 --> 01:19:06.750
power, His desire which we call as Adi Shakti
or we call it as Holy Ghost.

01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:14.780
These two have to meet, and the seat of the
Spirit is on the fontanel bone area here,

01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:18.949
seat of the Spirit is here, but it resides
in our heart.

01:19:18.949 --> 01:19:28.250
Now, so first we put our right hand on our
heart and then we put our right hand in the

01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:34.099
upper portion of our abdomen where is the
center of our mastery.

01:19:34.099 --> 01:19:40.429
This is created by all the great masters like
Abraham, Moses, Lao Tse, so many of them who

01:19:40.429 --> 01:19:42.610
were real masters.

01:19:42.610 --> 01:19:45.530
They have created this.

01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:52.659
Like Guru Nanaka, Janaka, all these people
have created this great center within us.

01:19:52.659 --> 01:19:59.530
Then we take down our hand in the lower portion
of our abdomen on the left hand side.

01:19:59.530 --> 01:20:08.199
This is the center of pure knowledge, pure
knowledge that is the one which gives us the

01:20:08.199 --> 01:20:10.640
awareness on our central nervous system.

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:17.150
It manifests a new dimension in our awareness
on our central nervous system which is called

01:20:17.150 --> 01:20:26.060
in Sanskrit as bodh, bodh from where the word
Buddha has come, or we can say it manifests

01:20:26.060 --> 01:20:27.390
in the word, vidh.

01:20:27.390 --> 01:20:29.100
Vidh is from where Vedas have come.

01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:33.420
That you feel the divine power on your central
nervous system, you feel the truth on your

01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:38.519
central nervous system because whatever we
have gained in our evolution, you feel it

01:20:38.519 --> 01:20:40.320
on our central nervous system.

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:42.630
That is what is "to know."

01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:44.170
Knowledge is not mental.

01:20:44.170 --> 01:20:50.329
It is in our evolutionary process to know
on your central nervous system like hot and

01:20:50.329 --> 01:20:51.329
cold.

01:20:51.329 --> 01:20:54.820
So now, this is the center which manifests
that pure knowledge.

01:20:54.820 --> 01:21:05.150
So, now we take our hand again upward and
put it on the center of mastery which is on

01:21:05.150 --> 01:21:15.560
the left hand side in the upper part of our
abdomen.

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:43.490
Then we take our hand onto our heart, and
here we know that Spirit resides here.

01:21:43.490 --> 01:21:51.699
Then we take our hand in the corner of our
neck and our shoulder here and put it back

01:21:51.699 --> 01:21:58.050
as far as possible and turn our head to our
right, we turn our head to our right.

01:21:58.050 --> 01:22:38.289
This is the center which as I have told you
is always in trouble when we feel guilty and

01:22:38.289 --> 01:22:44.929
today also I feel it's quite a lot among the
people who are here.

01:22:44.929 --> 01:22:50.139
So, now please remember not to feel guilty
at all.

01:22:50.139 --> 01:23:02.159
Turn your head to your right and just not
to feel guilty, is very important.

01:23:02.159 --> 01:23:15.590
Now then we put our hand across like this
on our forehead and pressing on both the temples

01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:37.900
with our small finger and our thumb on another
side we put all the other fingers on the head

01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:43.599
and put down our head like this.

01:23:43.599 --> 01:23:52.570
This is the center, this is the center for
forgiving others.

01:23:52.570 --> 01:23:54.199
Forgive everyone.

01:23:54.199 --> 01:24:03.630
Now, we take back this hand on the back side
of our head on the optic lobe here, on the

01:24:03.630 --> 01:24:17.940
back side of our head and push back our head
as far back as possible resting on our hand,

01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:54.769
and here is the center without feeling guilty,
without counting any mistakes, just for your

01:24:54.769 --> 01:25:01.809
satisfaction to ask for forgiveness from the
divine power.

01:25:01.809 --> 01:25:15.260
Now, then we stretch our hand, stretch our
hand and the center of our palm, we put it

01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:25.139
on the fontanel bone area which was the soft
bone in our childhood.

01:25:25.139 --> 01:25:40.630
Now we put down your head, put down our head
and press this area nicely by pushing our

01:25:40.630 --> 01:25:42.349
fingers outward.

01:25:42.349 --> 01:25:56.159
This is very important thing to do is to push
back your fingers outward so there's nice

01:25:56.159 --> 01:26:01.130
pressure on your fontanel bone area.

01:26:01.130 --> 01:26:13.409
Now here is the limbic area, the opening of
the limbic area is the fontanel bone area.

01:26:13.409 --> 01:26:22.260
So now what we do is to now slowly move our
hand clockwise pressing the scalp, move the

01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:26.019
scalp, clockwise, seven times.

01:26:26.019 --> 01:26:34.260
Push down your head, it's better, then you
can do it better, move it seven times clockwise.

01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:42.349
Now, I think everything was done all right
but we didn't push back the fingers nicely

01:26:42.349 --> 01:26:49.949
and the pressure was less but doesn't matter.

01:26:49.949 --> 01:26:57.030
Now, so, you have been already told what is
to be done.

01:26:57.030 --> 01:27:11.010
Now please, again see that you put both your
feet away from each other because they are

01:27:11.010 --> 01:27:14.519
two different powers.

01:27:14.519 --> 01:27:25.321
Put your left hand towards Me, put your right
hand on your head.

01:27:25.321 --> 01:27:26.321
No, not like that, you can sit, I mean you
can sit cross legged, cross legged is better,

01:27:26.321 --> 01:27:27.321
it's all right, for sitting down this cross
legged is better.

01:27:27.321 --> 01:27:28.321
I am just telling for people who are sitting
on the chairs.

01:27:28.321 --> 01:27:29.321
Just imagine people getting realization sitting
on the chairs.

01:27:29.321 --> 01:27:30.321
Is something great, isn't it?

01:27:30.321 --> 01:27:31.321
Otherwise, we had to go to Himalayas and starve
for so many days, work so hard, stand on your

01:27:31.321 --> 01:27:32.321
heads and still come back empty handed.

01:27:32.321 --> 01:27:33.321
You are specially blessed to be born in this
era.

01:27:33.321 --> 01:27:34.321
All right, so now we put our left hand towards
Me, and right hand on the heart and now we

01:27:34.321 --> 01:27:35.321
close our eyes.

01:27:35.321 --> 01:27:36.321
We don't open our eyes till I tell you.

01:27:36.321 --> 01:27:37.321
Please keep your eyes shut till I tell you.

01:27:37.321 --> 01:27:38.321
Now, the whole thing works like a divine computer,
so you have to ask a question.

01:27:38.321 --> 01:27:39.321
You can call Me Mother or you can call Me
Shri Mataji, whatever you like.

01:27:39.321 --> 01:27:40.321
Now, put your right hand on your heart and
left hand towards Me all the time.

01:27:40.321 --> 01:27:41.321
And, now sit comfortably, not bending too
much nor in a stretched manner but in a comfortable,

01:27:41.321 --> 01:27:42.321
straight way.

01:27:42.321 --> 01:27:43.321
Here now you ask a question three times, "Mother,
am I the Spirit?"

01:27:43.321 --> 01:27:44.321
This is the truth about you that you are the
Spirit.

01:27:44.321 --> 01:27:45.321
So now ask the question three times in your
heart, "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

01:27:45.321 --> 01:27:46.321
Now, if you are the Spirit, then you are your
master.

01:27:46.321 --> 01:27:47.321
So, now take your right hand in the upper
portion of your abdomen and ask a question,

01:27:47.321 --> 01:27:48.321
"Mother, am I my own master?"

01:27:48.321 --> 01:27:49.321
Ask this question three times.

01:27:49.321 --> 01:27:50.321
Now I have to tell you that I cannot force
pure knowledge on you.

01:27:50.321 --> 01:27:51.321
You have to ask for it.

01:27:51.321 --> 01:27:52.321
So, now please take your hand in the lower
portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

01:27:52.321 --> 01:27:53.321
Here you have to say six times, because this
center has got six petals.

01:27:53.321 --> 01:27:54.321
So, please say, "Mother, please give me pure
knowledge."

01:27:54.321 --> 01:27:55.321
Say this six times because I cannot force
on you.

01:27:55.321 --> 01:27:56.321
You have to ask in your freedom.

01:27:56.321 --> 01:27:57.321
I respect it.

01:27:57.321 --> 01:27:58.321
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the
Kundalini starts rising, so we have to nourish

01:27:58.321 --> 01:27:59.321
the upper centers so that it's easy for Her
to rise.

01:27:59.321 --> 01:28:00.321
So, now take your right hand in the upper
portion of your abdomen on the left hand side,

01:28:00.321 --> 01:28:01.321
press it hard.

01:28:01.321 --> 01:28:02.321
Here, you have to say with full confidence
ten times, "Mother, I am my own master."

01:28:02.321 --> 01:28:03.321
Say it with full confidence in yourself, ten
times, "Mother, I am my own master."

01:28:03.321 --> 01:28:04.321
Now, raise your right hand on your heart.

01:28:04.321 --> 01:28:05.321
I have already told you that Spirit resides
in your heart, so now here you say with full

01:28:05.321 --> 01:28:06.321
confidence, twelve times, "Mother, I am the
Spirit."

01:28:06.321 --> 01:28:07.321
We have to know this all-pervading power which
has created us, which is nourishing us, which

01:28:07.321 --> 01:28:08.321
is looking after us, which organizes us and
which loves us, is the ocean of knowledge

01:28:08.321 --> 01:28:09.321
and compassion.

01:28:09.321 --> 01:28:10.321
But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness,
and we cannot commit any mistakes that cannot

01:28:10.321 --> 01:28:11.321
be dissolved by the power of this ocean of
forgiveness.

01:28:11.321 --> 01:28:12.321
So, now please raise your hand in the corner
of your neck and your shoulder and push it

01:28:12.321 --> 01:28:13.321
back as far as possible on the spinal cord
and turn your head to right.

01:28:13.321 --> 01:28:14.321
And here, with full confidence, please say
sixteen times, "Mother, I am not guilty at

01:28:14.321 --> 01:28:15.321
all."

01:28:15.321 --> 01:28:16.321
Please say it sixteen times from your heart,
please say it.

01:28:16.321 --> 01:28:17.321
I have already told you that whether you forgive
or don't forgive, you do not do anything,

01:28:17.321 --> 01:28:18.321
it's a myth.

01:28:18.321 --> 01:28:19.321
But, if you don't forgive then you play into
wrong hands and torture yourself for nothing

01:28:19.321 --> 01:28:20.321
at all.

01:28:20.321 --> 01:28:21.321
So, now please raise your right hand on your
forehead across pressing both the temples

01:28:21.321 --> 01:28:22.321
with your small finger and your thumb and
putting all the three fingers on top of your

01:28:22.321 --> 01:28:23.321
head.

01:28:23.321 --> 01:28:24.321
And now, put it down your head properly, press
it hard on both the sides.

01:28:24.321 --> 01:28:25.321
And here you have to say from your heart,
not how many times, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

01:28:25.321 --> 01:28:26.321
From your heart, please say, "Mother, I forgive
everyone."

01:28:26.321 --> 01:28:27.321
Please do not say that it is difficult.

01:28:27.321 --> 01:28:28.321
It's the easiest thing to say.

01:28:28.321 --> 01:28:29.321
Put down your head properly, press it hard
and say it from your heart.

01:28:29.321 --> 01:28:33.199
Now, without feeling guilty, without counting
your mistakes, just for your satisfaction,

01:28:33.199 --> 01:28:39.699
you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine
Power.

01:28:39.699 --> 01:28:48.360
So, now take your right hand on the back side
of your head and push back your head as far

01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:53.330
as possible, on the hand balancing.

01:28:53.330 --> 01:29:05.730
Now here, you have to say again from your
heart, now how many times, "Oh Divine Power,

01:29:05.730 --> 01:29:13.179
if I have done anything wrong knowingly or
unknowingly, please forgive me."

01:29:13.179 --> 01:29:16.849
This is to be said for your own satisfaction.

01:29:16.849 --> 01:29:25.100
Push back your head as much as possible.

01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:40.409
Now, the last center which is most important:
stretch your palm as far as possible, put

01:29:40.409 --> 01:29:56.650
it on, put the center of your palm on top
of the fontanel bone area which was the soft

01:29:56.650 --> 01:29:59.210
bone in your childhood.

01:29:59.210 --> 01:30:06.559
Now put down your head as much as you can,
please put it down.

01:30:06.559 --> 01:30:09.219
Now, stretch your fingers.

01:30:09.219 --> 01:30:16.800
Please stretch them properly and put a nice
pressure on your fontanel bone area.

01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:24.869
Here, again I respect your freedom and I cannot
force Self-realization on you.

01:30:24.869 --> 01:30:27.300
You have to ask for it.

01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:40.280
So, now please move your scalp, slowly, seven
times, clockwise, saying, "Mother, please

01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:41.949
give me my Self-realization."

01:30:41.949 --> 01:31:37.430
[Mother blows in the microphone seven times.]

01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:53.579
Now, please take down your hands, both the
hands, and please place them towards Me and

01:31:53.579 --> 01:31:56.539
gradually open your eyes.

01:31:56.539 --> 01:32:06.369
Now, watch Me without thinking.

01:32:06.369 --> 01:32:23.340
Now, please put your left hand towards Me.

01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:33.290
Bend your head and see for yourself if there's
a cool breeze coming out of your head.

01:32:33.290 --> 01:32:36.679
Please see with your right hand.

01:32:36.679 --> 01:32:48.100
Some people get it very close and some far
away but don't put your hand on top of your

01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:49.100
head.

01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:54.930
Just see for yourself if there's a cool breeze
coming out of your head.

01:32:54.930 --> 01:33:04.119
Now, please put your right hand towards Me
and bend your head again and see for yourself

01:33:04.119 --> 01:33:09.530
if there's a cool breeze coming out of your
head.

01:33:09.530 --> 01:33:10.530
Some people get it quite far away.

01:33:10.530 --> 01:33:17.929
Please put again your left hand towards Me
and see for yourself again if there's a cool

01:33:17.929 --> 01:33:24.369
breeze coming out of your head.

01:33:24.369 --> 01:33:37.579
Now raise both your hands towards the sky
like this, push back your head and ask a question,

01:33:37.579 --> 01:33:48.460
"Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy
Ghost?"

01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:49.460
or "Mother, is this the all-pervading power
of God's love?" or "Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?"

01:33:49.460 --> 01:33:50.460
Any one of these question you ask three times.

01:33:50.460 --> 01:33:51.460
Now, put your hands down.

01:33:51.460 --> 01:33:52.460
You feel very relaxed and there's won't be
any thoughts.

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:53.460
You can watch Me without thinking.

01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:54.460
All those who have felt cool or hot breeze
on their hands, on their fingertips or out

01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:55.460
of their head, please raise both your hands.

01:33:55.460 --> 01:33:56.460
That's it.

01:33:56.460 --> 01:33:57.460
May God bless you.

01:33:57.460 --> 01:33:58.460
[Applause]

01:33:58.460 --> 01:33:59.460
I am here only for tonight and I would like
to meet you all if you want to meet Me, I

01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:00.460
would like to shake hands with you.

01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:01.460
Thank you.

01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:02.460
[Applause]

01:34:02.460 --> 01:34:03.460
[While walking towards the car] Now you have
to look after the new people, all of you have

01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:04.460
to look after the new people with care, with
understanding.

01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:07.570
And, best of luck to all of you.

01:34:07.570 --> 01:34:08.719
It's a very delicate work.

01:34:08.719 --> 01:34:29.710
Whatever impression they get from you, that
is going to work out.

01:34:29.710 --> 01:34:30.739
They must feel that "these people are very
loving and kind" and you don't disappoint

01:34:30.739 --> 01:34:31.739
them too much.

01:34:31.739 --> 01:34:32.739
You must show your own discipline.

01:34:32.739 --> 01:34:33.739
[Shri Mataji talks to individual yogis]

01:34:33.739 --> 01:34:34.739
It's with very difficulty that we are building
up Sahaja Yoga and Sahaja Yogis should not

01:34:34.739 --> 01:34:35.739
break it at least but they can build it up
themselves such a lot.

01:34:35.739 --> 01:34:40.019
So, we have to be like them, compete with
people who have done something for Sahaja

01:34:40.019 --> 01:34:53.349
Yoga, compete with them and not with them
who are trying to destroy Sahaja Yoga.

01:34:53.349 --> 01:34:57.760
It's so important.

01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:08.030
One has to play one's own role.
