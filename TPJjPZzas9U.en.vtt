00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.319
It’s very gratifying to

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:18.759
see so many of you Americans have gathered
today,

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:23.129
and tomorrow you want to have the Vishnumaya
Puja.

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:37.629
I remember the days when I used to talk to
chairs only,

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:46.300
but all these years after working so very
hard,

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.599
visiting this country so many times, still
we have

00:05:50.599 --> 00:06:11.220
very, very few Sahaja Yogis compared to any
other nation.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:17.219
In this country of Shri Krishna, is inevitable

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:25.710
that people will put their attention to money,

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:38.809
because He is the incarnation of Vishnu and
His Power is Lakshmi.

00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:46.449
Lakshmi is the Goddess of money,

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:56.190
but that is not the money that is called as
“dollar”.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.840
It is the money which means

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:11.080
a complete, integrated form of material wealth.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:22.539
As it is, matter has only one power:

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:28.650
that it can express our love to others.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:35.879
Like, if you have to express your love to
someone,

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:45.869
you would make a nice present

00:07:45.869 --> 00:07:55.249
or something that is useful for the person;

00:07:55.249 --> 00:08:11.479
or you may give your property, wealth to your
children.

00:08:11.479 --> 00:08:22.479
In a very symbolic manner, you might even
give a small, little stone,

00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:26.740
if you are a child to your mother,

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:35.820
which you find interesting that would make
your mother happy.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:51.550
But all the time, the idea behind giving matter
to someone

00:08:51.550 --> 00:09:01.290
is to show your love and emotions,

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:11.630
to show your concern and express your heart.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:22.060
So to express your heart through something
gross, we use matter.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.680
Now when this matter is converted into something

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:35.500
and it becomes sort of an economic activity

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:41.529
where you have to price it,

00:09:41.529 --> 00:09:51.000
then the attention shifts from emotions to
matter

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.610
as something that has some superficial value

00:09:55.610 --> 00:10:03.680
than the deeper value that is love.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:13.209
Even in the olden days when people had lots
of money with them,

00:10:13.209 --> 00:10:22.390
they used to decorate their houses, wear good
dresses,

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:28.470
to invite people into their homes

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:33.800
to make them happy, to make them comfortable.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:40.610
A rich man would have a fair or something
like that

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.829
to make people happy.

00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:48.430
Gradually, again the attention shifted from
that

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:56.839
to something which is extremely gross, is
to show off.

00:10:56.839 --> 00:11:02.660
But the purpose fails completely when you
try to show off,

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.769
another person is never happy.

00:11:04.769 --> 00:11:08.070
On the contrary, he’s jealous.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:11.279
So what’s the use of showing off

00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:14.740
because the purpose is to make another person
happy.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:20.510
Instead of that, you make him jealous.

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:24.600
Then second steps comes in with it

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:34.139
that you create a antagonistic feelings in
another person.

00:11:34.139 --> 00:11:39.339
That person thinks that, “Why should he
have and why should I not?”

00:11:39.339 --> 00:11:43.600
Because that person cannot enjoy what you
have.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.360
Thus, there are theories and theories that
came out

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:53.930
in our political systems, into our economic
systems:

00:11:53.930 --> 00:12:06.759
how to exagerate it and how to utilize it
for something even grosser.

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:12.839
And this grossness grew more and more and
more.

00:12:12.839 --> 00:12:18.560
Once you allow the matter to act like that,

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.939
this matter sits on our top.

00:12:21.939 --> 00:12:24.189
We are powerless people.

00:12:24.189 --> 00:12:28.410
It’s the matter that becomes powerful,

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.779
because it rules us completely.

00:12:30.779 --> 00:12:34.000
We can’t do without this, we can’t do
without that,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.220
we can’t do without this.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:43.319
And then we become complete slaves of matter.

00:12:43.319 --> 00:12:50.540
Matter sits so much upon us that we get completely
blinded

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:59.529
to what our purpose is to be on this earth,

00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:07.970
and start crawling like worms under the pressure
of matter.

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.290
What is this?

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:17.699
Is nothing but stones, bricks, everything
is matter.

00:13:17.699 --> 00:13:21.600
What is the importance of this?

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:30.680
Is nothing, except we have to have a seminar.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:33.839
If we don’t have the seminar,

00:13:33.839 --> 00:13:37.339
if you are not going to do anything sensible

00:13:37.339 --> 00:13:47.959
to create harmony and understanding, no use
having all this.

00:13:47.959 --> 00:13:51.410
This is what has to be realized:

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:57.139
that matter has its own purpose and, as Sahaja
Yogis,

00:13:57.139 --> 00:14:03.180
we are not going to be ruled by matter.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:09.920
Is very difficult to decide because from our
childhood we are taught,

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:10.920
“Be careful!

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.110
Don’t touch this.

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:13.430
Don’t touch that.”

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:15.879
As if that is the God.

00:14:15.879 --> 00:14:20.180
“Don’t spoil it.”

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:28.170
So the whole attention gets engulfed

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:35.540
into this gross existence of matter.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:44.839
So the person starts moving from his ascent
to his descent.

00:14:44.839 --> 00:14:50.670
From matter you became carbon,

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:54.639
from carbon you become amino acids,

00:14:54.639 --> 00:15:00.790
from amino acids you became living things,

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:04.529
from living things you became human beings

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:10.089
and now you have to become Sahaja Yogis.

00:15:10.089 --> 00:15:14.540
But the attention starts moving downwards
towards matter

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:22.060
and we acquire all the qualities that is matter,

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:30.350
except for one which only we can give that
power to matter,

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:38.009
that it can express our love.

00:15:38.009 --> 00:15:43.769
You become static, you become unchangeable;

00:15:43.769 --> 00:15:53.139
and when you start using this matter

00:15:53.139 --> 00:16:01.269
for a lower end than this, then you hurt.

00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:12.959
Same matter starts evolving into things like
weapons.

00:16:12.959 --> 00:16:16.490
First must be the stone they must be hitting
with,

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:19.740
then the clubs of stones.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:24.310
Then came the swords,

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:33.600
then came the guns, then came atomic energy.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:38.860
So the same matter has gone into evolution
into another direction.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:47.810
But matter could have been moved into a higher
direction

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:57.180
if you had seen the quality of matter to give
joy.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:02.329
Then we did that for quite some time,

00:17:02.329 --> 00:17:12.130
we made beautiful carvings, beautiful churches
and temples,

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:20.589
beautiful paintings, beautiful statues.

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:29.070
I think it ended up in America when they made
the Statue of Liberty.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:33.679
After that it took another form.

00:17:33.679 --> 00:17:39.600
Now if you see the women of America,

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:44.120
you will understand that it has no resemblance

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:46.540
with that of the Statue of Liberty.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.930
I mean, even to have a model

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:53.530
you’ll have to import some from somewhere
else

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:58.230
to make a model to create that statue.

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:08.120
That dignity, that presence, that motherly
feeling that she emits,

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:13.400
the protection she gives with her strength.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.200
Everybody is tired like that.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:22.540
Everybody is absolutely a dainty darling.

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:28.010
They do not want to take any responsibilities,

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:34.430
put the responsibility on to somebody else.

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:39.410
Here stands the symbol of such great protection

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:44.600
of a woman to man.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.470
On the contrary, the same protection today

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:51.670
has become a domination of men.

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:55.310
Instead of men becoming men, they have becoming
cabbages here.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:19:00.240
It’s the other way round things have moved.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:05.380
I find it very hard to believe

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:11.010
that the same time we had people like Abraham
Lincoln.

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:14.990
Now I don’t think we can produce anyone
like this.

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:19.380
Where are those mothers who created Abraham
Lincoln?

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:22.870
Where are those great women who sacrificed

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:27.470
everything for their children to give them
such greatness?

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:33.060
George Washington fought the whole time all
his life

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:35.780
with such a strong wife he had.

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:39.990
But here now the women have become nothing
but matter

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:45.050
they think that by wearing such and such dress

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:47.700
or going to a hair dresser,

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:52.520
cutting all their hair in a funny way they
become powerful.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:57.440
Why I am talking about women today because we
are talking of Vishnumaya,

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.210
but not to hurt you.

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:02.500
Because in this men are very much responsible.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:06.500
us see, see the point, where we are going.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.750
The whole society is ruined today, if you
see.

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:13.040
You feel terrible when you see how things
are happening

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.770
in this country.

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:16.550
The children are shooting everyone,

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:19.120
mall little children are shooting.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.760
On the road if you go, everybody is panicked.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.150
Why it has happened to us

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:31.400
where you have created such great heroes in
this country

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.700
and now you cannot create any hero?

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.030
What has gone wrong, where?

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:41.800
I know they have made a mess, these men have
made a mess

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:49.080
of all this politics and everything that they
call “manly”, so-called.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:54.540
But, Vishnumaya is the power of a woman.

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:57.890
She’s the power of a woman, and they say
that

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:03.230
American women are very, very powerful.

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:08.240
Where does the power lie?

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.500
The power lies how many men you can divorce

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:15.420
and have how much money with you?

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.520
How many people you can divorce and have,
under the law,

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:22.840
so much money – that’s not, that’s not
the power of a woman.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:29.130
One has to understand where have we lost our
power.

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:34.250
The power of a woman is not enslaving for
men,

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:36.580
that they should appreciate you morning till
evening,

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:39.870
every person on the road must look at you

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:42.380
– that’s not the power of a woman.

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:45.410
That could be the power of a prostitute,

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:49.970
but not of a woman who stands as a symbol
of liberty.

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:54.610
The power of woman is like that of the Mother
Earth.

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:56.540
See how much She’s done for you.

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.910
She’s given you all the greenery, the beauty.

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:01.460
Wherever She goes down, She fills Herself
up with water,

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:05.040
and She gives you such joy and happiness

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.230
and bears all the problems of the world

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.910
despite of whatever things we have done to
Her,

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:13.240
despite the way we extracted all Her wealth
and everything,

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.360
still She’s giving us wealth.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.920
That’s what we are!

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:21.600
When we have lost our power, our society has
come down.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.860
The society has to be maintained by women,
not by men.

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:30.190
One must understand, woman plays the most
important role.

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:33.280
She’s in no way less than man,

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:37.090
but if she becomes this kind of a power,

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:41.590
destruction starts moving in the other direction.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:45.110
The whole topsy turvyness we have to correct
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:49.510
When I see the image of Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:52.990
when I see when we all will be together,

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:56.760
where we will be all enjoying ourselves,

00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:01.690
I want to see My women, My daughters,

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:06.900
to be the symbol of love and symbol of sacrifice

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:08.770
and symbol of understanding.

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:13.640
And then the dynamism of this sacrifice

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.690
will be shown because they are potential.

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:20.210
You are the ones, you are the ones who are
really potential

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:24.290
and you have to give them energy to be kinetic.

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:27.880
Those who cannot have potential energies have
become potential.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.620
What’s the use?

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:32.290
While those who have the potential energies

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:33.290
have become kinetic.

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:34.720
What’s the use?

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.480
This has to shift now.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.140
We have to think about it, understand.

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:40.250
We’ve gone wrong,

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:42.450
really we’ve gone wrong somewhere

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:44.980
and this wrong our children will have to pay,

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:50.400
their children will have to pay, the whole
nation will have to pay.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:56.700
Turn your attention to something very noble.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:59.220
This is the power of Vishnumaya

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:04.120
because Vishnumaya is the One Who was the
sister of Shri Krishna.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:07.340
She came as Shri Krishna’s sister.

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:12.640
Of course She is the virgin.

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:16.350
She was born as the sister of Shri Krishna.

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:18.990
Now see, the story is very interesting.

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:21.250
If you see the story, then you’ll understand

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:23.200
what I’m trying to tell you.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.740
The story is like this:

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:34.860
The eighth Incarnation – as they call it,
power;

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:42.250
according to Sahaja Yoga we call Him the King
of the Vishuddhi Chakra,

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:45.280
Shri Krishna was to be born.

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:50.610
He was born in a jail.

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:59.400
His parents were in the jail.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:05.850
So Vishnumaya, at the same time, took birth

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:10.750
in a village called as Nanda Gram

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:14.190
where another friend called Nanda was living,

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:16.670
and his wife was Yeshoda.

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:21.620
She took Her birth in that family.

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:29.980
Then She was a very, very powerful child.

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:37.550
When Shri Krishna was born,

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:44.160
He was carried by the father from the jail.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:48.160
Because of Shri Krishna’s powers, all his
shackles,

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:53.100
all his chains were broken, the doors opened,

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:57.740
and he waded through the river Yamuna

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:03.400
and carried the child and gave it to Nanda.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:12.300
Nanda said, “I have got a child but She
is a girl,

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:17.480
about the same time.”

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.480
So see the power that time

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.510
this little child gave to Mother Yeshoda.

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:24.460
They said, “All right.

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.400
Do one thing:

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:32.080
take this child with you and replace it with
Shri Krishna.”

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:37.860
What a sacrifice for a woman to give her own
child at that time,

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:47.140
a little babe, to be killed by this horrible
fellow, Kansa!

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.440
No mother would do such a thing.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:53.020
Can you think of any mother who will give
her child

00:26:53.020 --> 00:27:01.560
to be killed for the replacement of Shri Krishna?

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:04.920
We cannot think of any mother,

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.350
but we had some mothers like this in India

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:10.310
who did very great sacrifices.

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:17.010
Now, this was the greatest sacrifice one could
think of - for a woman.

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:22.660
She may sacrifice small, little things or
quite a lot of things,

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:28.610
but to sacrifice your own child is the greatest
thing.

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:33.570
The woman sacrifices for her children quite
a lot.

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:44.390
She works for them, she keeps nights and nights
vigil for them.

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:47.230
She does so much for her children.

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:50.270
But to give up Her own child is something,

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:54.180
such a extraordinary thing, which She did.

00:27:54.180 --> 00:28:00.830
And when he brought the child, that child
was the Power,

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:09.600
was the Adi Shakti in the form of a virgin
and was kept back.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.710
So when this Kansa came in the morning,

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:16.560
and he heard a little girl is born, he was
amazed.

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:27.600
It was going to be a son, how is it a girl
is born?

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.830
“Whatever it is,” he said, “I’ll destroy
this Child.”

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:37.610
Got hold of that Child and he was about to
hit the Child on the ground,

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:42.480
when She slipped out and went into the sky
and

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:51.540
became a lightning to announce that,

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:56.880
“The One who was to destroy is still alive.”

00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:02.880
He was shocked.

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:09.540
So behind all this what we see a character
of Yeshoda

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:18.150
Who was so sacrificing, of the father who
was so sacrificing,

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:23.640
of a society where it was important

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:30.980
to preserve the Incarnation above everything
else.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:36.420
And this kind of happening when it took place,

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:41.570
Shri Krishna grew up in the house of Nanda

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:48.670
where He then expressed Himself as a powerful
personality.

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:54.390
But this Vishnumaya is there

00:29:54.390 --> 00:30:00.590
and She is very active these days, extremely
active.

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:07.250
She’s the One which is within you, very
much there,

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:09.550
in the Left Vishuddhi She sits there.

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:12.460
She doesn’t allow you to feel guilty.

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:13.750
“Why are you guilty?”

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:16.110
All the time She says,

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:18.730
“Why are you guilty?

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:19.730
Why are you unhappy?

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:21.800
You are realized souls, you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.520
Get out of it!

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:28.640
This guilty business, no good – get out
of it!

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:29.640
Come along.

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:34.140
You have to find a way.”

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:38.350
Yes, the destruction is ahead of you.

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:42.460
You see the destruction of this great country,

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:45.960
you see so clearly is working out.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:51.560
I feel there are two worlds which are now
building up.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:55.880
One that is getting destroyed; one that is
coming out of it

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.720
like a lotus.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:02.560
But behind is the Power of Vishnumaya.

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:09.520
Is the Power of Vishnumaya, the Power of Sister
of Shri Krishna.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:15.070
Now this Vishnumaya is a female Power, as
you know that.

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:21.020
She didn’t care for anything mundane.

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:35.200
Can you think of Vishnumaya going after all
these nonsensical things?

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.670
And to protect Her brothers,

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:40.600
and to give all the strength to those brothers,

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:44.040
what did She do?

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.260
What did She do?

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:50.600
She came in Her purest form, as a Sister.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:55.640
You all have here so many Sahaja Yogis as
your brothers.

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:59.700
You must be having other people also as your
brothers.

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:02.390
This purity has to be brought into women.

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:05.520
Unless and until this purity comes into them,

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:08.740
they have no powers, they are powerless.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:12.150
So we come down to main thing is that:

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:19.750
where the women are pure and chaste, there
resides the powers

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:22.270
of all the deities.

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:27.970
So it’s such a responsibility for us to
be very chaste,

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:34.690
and to be very pure, and to be sisters to
our brothers

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:38.220
so that their brothers are also protected

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:40.580
from the temptations of the world;

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:45.130
so that they, too, have their attention onto
something higher and greater.

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:49.370
It’s a very, very great day I feel

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:54.230
to come down to America to do this Puja.

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:57.640
I’m going to tell you all about it, but
let us understand

00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:01.860
that we are power, we are power.

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:08.880
We are not the power which can be dominated
by money, by anything else.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:16.880
We are power because we are Sahaja Yoginis,
because we have that character.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:23.050
Now, it’s important for men to understand
the value of women.

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:28.260
Those men in this country, all right they
look like cabbages

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:32.210
but they can be horrid, absolutely horrid
people,

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:37.880
because they have no sense of purity of their
character.

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:41.360
If the man is not all right, how can he have
a sister who is pure?

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:48.560
If the man doesn’t believe in the chastity
of life

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:52.280
– for some men, I mean most of the men,
there’s nothing like chastity.

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:57.380
They never believed in anything like chastity
– in the modern times.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:03.810
That is what we lack, and in Sahaja Yoga when
I think of My children,

00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:08.370
of My sons, they should be brilliant with
chastity.

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:13.770
The whole presence must shine with chastity.

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:17.240
When people look at them they should say,

00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:19.399
“Oh, that’s innocence going.

00:34:19.399 --> 00:34:21.010
See the innocence

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:24.379
and the chastity moving together!”

00:34:24.379 --> 00:34:28.320
So that’s what is in men: the innocence.

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:32.990
It’s not necessary to be too cunning.

00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:34.560
Nobody can deceive you.

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:37.580
An innocent person, with one stroke,

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:41.880
can kill hundred useless people.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:43.730
So it is important

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:49.960
that men must also understand the value of
innocence.

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:53.620
She was Krishna’s sister, all right.

00:34:53.620 --> 00:35:00.180
Now look at Shri Krishna as a child,

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:06.110
how innocent He was, and how powerful!

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:10.760
He wanted to eat the butter.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:15.480
Now why He wanted to eat the butter because

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:19.570
all the butter that was made in Gokul, in
that place,

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:25.260
was sent to Mathura where this horrible King
Kansa was ruling.

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:31.450
And all his military people became very strong
by eating that butter.

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:35.690
So He didn’t want them to eat the butter,
so He started

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:41.840
a kind of a tribe of small children

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:46.120
and a game that they climb on top of each
other.

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:52.350
And the butter was kept in a pot hanging from
the roof,

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:56.720
so they would go and eat all that up.

00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:00.090
In that little childhood He started this innocent
play,

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:03.610
so all the children used to climb up and eat
the butter.

00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:08.960
So now there’s no butter left, so how will
they take it to Mathura?

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:12.510
This was done and one day His mother caught
hold of Him.

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:17.710
She said, “Did You eat any butter from here?”

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:19.950
All butter was here all around.

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:21.360
He said, “How?

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:24.590
How can I eat the butter?

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:26.890
See, can I reach My hand there?

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:29.760
See now, how can I …”

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:32.790
“Oh, so You took the stick and broke it?”

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:34.950
“No, no, I did not.”

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:35.950
“Then what is all this?”

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:38.300
“See, these are all My friends who ate it.

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:44.550
I put it on My mouth so that you can beat
Me.”

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:48.710
So innocently talking like an ordinary child,
this One,

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:50.230
an ordinary, simple child.

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:52.130
So Mother said, “All right.

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:53.900
Let Me see Your mouth.”

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:57.590
He opens the mouth and it is the Complete She sees

00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:04.440
She sees the complete universe, complete universe
revolving into His mouth.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:06.050
And She sees it.

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:09.200
And She says, “Oh Lord, please forgive Me.

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.200
I forgot!

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:15.210
I really forgot that You are the Lord of this
universe

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:17.450
and I am doubting You!”

00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:19.490
She just fell at His feet.

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:22.220
“There must be some play in what You’re
doing.”

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:30.990
In a simple, innocent way like a child would
say He told the Mother.

00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:35.550
So the innocence of a child and the innocence
of a virgin,

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:39.530
or you can say the chastity of a virgin

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:44.940
and innocence of a child

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:57.060
brought forth, brought forth the existence
of America.

00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:01.610
Out of that, this country was created.

00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:09.360
So you can imagine that this great country
has now,

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:13.130
see everywhere the beauty, I mean

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:17.770
every place you go to, you find such greenery.

00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:22.360
I went to Los Angeles, it’s a desert,

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:29.340
but still you could get water and you can
make it into a beautiful place.

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:35.210
You have everything that a human being can
ask for,

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:39.140
but there’s something lacking:

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:46.240
is not to understand why it was given to us,
how it was give to us.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:53.510
As I told you, it was created out of that
innocence and chastity.

00:38:53.510 --> 00:39:00.100
And if we cannot think of that chastity and
that innocence,

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:05.980
then we can never mature into sensible, proper
Sahaja Yogis.

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:10.430
There’s nothing to feel hurt when somebody
tells you that,

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:12.720
“See, this what we are.”

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:15.210
Basically, that’s what we are

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:20.750
and that’s how fundamentally we should understand
and

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:30.540
grow into a personality that is American.

00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:38.320
But what one finds is all the instruments
of destruction are created.

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:43.020
Like small children, I mean, you find children
and children.

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:46.390
Small children, you’ll find them, they fight
each other.

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:47.390
All right.

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:49.140
Fights is all right.

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:53.020
But not only that, they kill their parents.

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:55.450
They kill their grandparents.

00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:57.290
What’s that going on?

00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:58.610
How is it happening?

00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:01.020
Where have we lost the innocence?

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.170
What’s gone wrong?

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:05.820
Where are we mistaken?

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.690
We have to just turn round.

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:10.610
If you really feel you are Americans,

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:11.780
you have to save this country.

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:15.530
It’s in great danger of complete destruction.

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:20.640
You do not realize what you’re facing.

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:23.490
It’s not the AIDS

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:31.020
I’m so much worried about, or it’s not
the earthquake which is hanging on them.

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:38.290
It is complete losing of your being and becoming
matter.

00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:43.550
When you have robots, you’ll become same,

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:47.850
and you’ll destroy yourself in that way.

00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:56.320
It’s a very, very serious matter which is
not yet seen through your eyes,

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:59.440
for you do not see it.

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:02.160
You must really be praying that,

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:05.880
“Oh God, please save this country!”

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:12.170
You should be really asking for nothing else
but

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:17.860
“save this great country”, a part and
parcel of Virata,

00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:25.060
and the Virata rules in the Vishuddhi.

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:29.760
It’s such a problem for Me.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.380
Whole thing is so upside down.

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:39.350
I have to start from America, and where do
I go?

00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:41.070
I started from America.

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:45.130
I came here, as I told you, talking to chairs,

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:53.640
and still so many are just chairs.

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:57.040
All the subtleties from the brain have gone
away.

00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:01.560
Whatever advancement has been made, has made
them primitive.

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.480
And after some time, they’ll become like
stones.

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:07.920
They won’t feel anything, they won’t hear
anything,

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.790
they won’t understand anything.

00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:11.540
They’ll not grow anymore.

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:15.790
Then, what am I to do?

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:26.930
This universe which was created as the working
of the Virata

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:33.550
will have to shift to some other style of
universe,

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:38.040
which is a very big shifting.

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:43.869
For all the Sahaja Yogis it is necessary to
understand the importance

00:42:43.869 --> 00:42:46.840
of their existence as Sahaja Yogis.

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:50.800
They are Sahaja Yogis first, and Americans
later.

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:55.310
But, if they’re Americans first, then they
must work it out.

00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:57.230
It’s not something sideways

00:42:57.230 --> 00:43:02.410
– you see, “all right, there’s a seminar,
let’s go for the seminar,

00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:05.150
good” – then come back home, again just
the same.

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:10.100
You have to really meditate, work very hard.

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:13.900
You are the people who are going to change
this country;

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:17.850
and, ultimately, the whole of the universe.

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:19.820
Is you who has to understand.

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:22.510
It’s not Me.

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:28.710
You have to see it and understand that your
position is very important.

00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:33.720
In Sahaja Yoga, Americans have a very great
position.

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:37.320
Remember, in the beginning we paid everything

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.020
for these Americans to come down to India.

00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:42.430
They were treated with such lavishness.

00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:47.300
And everybody was saying, “Mother, why are
You paying for their fares?

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:49.350
Why are You paying for their food?

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:51.592
Why do you want them to be so treated?

00:43:51.592 --> 00:43:52.680
What’s so great about Americans?

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:54.530
Again they’ll develop ego.”

00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:56.440
I said, “You don’t know.”

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.240
Of course all those are lost now.

00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:00.420
I don’t see them anywhere,

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:07.850
whatever it is, My desire, My anxiety, My
concern has worked.

00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:10.600
I’m very happy you all are here.

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:14.250
I could come here for the Vishnumaya Puja.

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:17.110
It’s something I hope we should work it
out.

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:23.650
I don’t know how far we have gone now.

00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:26.110
In the subtler way I think Ganesha Puja has
helped a lot,

00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:30.120
and I can see the two worlds coming up very
clearly.

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:35.460
One which is living, which is pulsating,

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:42.440
which is full of vibrations, which is becoming
the lotus;

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:48.410
the another one which is becoming the worm,
the mud, the mire.

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:54.190
I see it so clearly, separated by this Ganesha
Puja.

00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:57.360
Now by this Vishnu Puja, let us see

00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:02.450
if we become those dynamic, loving, affectionate,

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:10.340
compassionate Sahaja Yogis, and pure relationships
with each other,

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:15.950
so that people see you as something very great
like the lightening,

00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:21.640
they should see you shining in the sky

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:28.010
and they should then come down to Sahaja Yoga

00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:33.500
and come up to the expectations of Shri Krishna.

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:36.029
May God bless you.
