WEBVTT

00:59.601 --> 01:03.112
So, this is how Mahamaya plays.

01:03.827 --> 01:05.919
They had planned everything.

01:06.039 --> 01:10.399
They had all the arrangements made

01:10.519 --> 01:13.070
and the sari was missing.

01:13.190 --> 01:18.910
All right. So they came and told Me that the sari’s missing,

01:19.030 --> 01:20.664
so now what to do?

01:20.784 --> 01:25.046
You can’t have puja without the sari, according to them.

01:25.166 --> 01:28.257
So I said, “All right, let’s wait.

01:28.377 --> 01:30.591
If it arrives in time we’ll have it;

01:30.711 --> 01:33.569
otherwise we can have it later.

01:33.734 --> 01:37.632
But I was least disturbed,

01:38.188 --> 01:40.777
least upset.

01:40.897 --> 01:45.229
Because I do not have a mental conception of it.

01:47.306 --> 01:48.855
But if you have a mental conception,

01:48.975 --> 01:52.020
“Oh, we have programmed everything, arranged everything.

01:52.140 --> 01:55.233
We have done this and now it’s fizzling out.”

01:55.353 --> 02:01.155
Doesn’t matter. Nothing is fizzling out.

02:04.499 --> 02:06.568
But that is what we cannot do.

02:06.688 --> 02:08.823
Because you asked Me today, “What is Mahamaya?”

02:08.943 --> 02:12.121
This is what it is.

02:15.299 --> 02:18.861
You must learn to accept whatever comes your way.

02:18.981 --> 02:21.304
That’s one of the things.

02:21.546 --> 02:25.141
And here where we feel frustrated, angry,

02:25.261 --> 02:30.798
upset and spoil our joy, one of the things,

02:31.390 --> 02:34.394
because we make a mental projection.

02:34.514 --> 02:36.794
Mentally we calculate something.

02:36.914 --> 02:38.134
This has to be.

02:38.254 --> 02:43.626
And it’s really in a way a subtle ego feeling.

02:43.939 --> 02:50.278
Because I thought, “That’s what is destined. All right.

02:50.398 --> 02:53.018
We’ll have it tomorrow. What does it matter?”

02:53.138 --> 02:57.859
In any case I told Mr. Srivastava that I’ll be back

02:57.979 --> 02:59.957
only about two o’clock.

03:00.077 --> 03:01.317
He said, “Why not in the morning?”

03:01.437 --> 03:05.141
“I don’t think it will be feasible.”

03:07.388 --> 03:11.567
So this is how you become avyagra.

03:11.694 --> 03:16.120
Vyagra means person who is worried.

03:16.240 --> 03:19.510
The one who is not worried.

03:19.630 --> 03:22.096
So we worry because of two things.

03:22.216 --> 03:30.202
Firstly, we worry that what will happen in the future?

03:32.885 --> 03:35.122
Future doesn’t exist.

03:35.242 --> 03:36.748
If you have made up your mind

03:36.868 --> 03:38.513
that this should happen in the future,

03:38.633 --> 03:42.282
then you get upset. That’s one thing.

03:43.303 --> 03:45.885
But you have not made any mental picture,

03:46.005 --> 03:48.203
you will see what comes on the scene.

03:48.323 --> 03:52.936
You’ll watch whatever appears.

03:53.056 --> 03:55.700
Then you’re not worried, because you’re anxious to see

03:55.820 --> 03:58.345
what’s going to happen.

03:58.465 --> 04:03.961
That’s one way, that you feel hurt, that you’re worried.

04:04.081 --> 04:07.692
Secondly you worry when you have built up a myth,

04:07.812 --> 04:14.774
picture of that “Oh, we’re going to have a puja now,

04:14.934 --> 04:16.993
and we are not having it.”

04:17.113 --> 04:18.819
So you are upset.

04:18.939 --> 04:22.695
What difference does it make?

04:22.815 --> 04:28.034
And then you cannot enjoy My talk today and the puja tomorrow.

04:28.154 --> 04:30.330
Because today you think it was going to be puja.

04:30.450 --> 04:34.987
We are all dressed up well. Very nice

04:35.163 --> 04:37.323
We spend so much time to get ready for the puja.

04:37.443 --> 04:41.622
All right, we’ll have it tomorrow. What does it matter?

04:43.254 --> 04:46.279
We really decorated ourselves well.

04:46.400 --> 04:48.077
We were all ready for the puja,

04:48.197 --> 04:49.850
we were sitting here for the puja,

04:49.970 --> 04:53.360
and now what has happened!

04:55.483 --> 04:59.954
I didn’t wear My sari for puja at all.

05:00.562 --> 05:03.777
I knew what was coming.

05:12.035 --> 05:14.673
So, it’s all right to see you like this.

05:14.793 --> 05:17.096
Because normally in the puja, I never see you dressed like this,

05:17.216 --> 05:19.189
I’m busy with Myself.

05:19.309 --> 05:24.644
Now I can see you nicely dressed. I feel very happy about it.

05:27.549 --> 05:33.379
And these mental things are responsible for frustrating us.

05:33.730 --> 05:37.344
Like as I was telling you about money. Same thing happens.

05:37.464 --> 05:39.651
In India people come.

05:39.771 --> 05:42.804
They keep so much money for buying things.

05:42.924 --> 05:46.623
You see, sometimes they come loaded just like

05:46.836 --> 05:48.685
what you call traders.

05:48.805 --> 05:50.711
The customs are so kind, I mean

05:50.831 --> 05:52.910
Sahaj Yogis have a free pass,

05:53.030 --> 05:55.341
whether in India, or in England or anywhere.

05:55.461 --> 05:57.369
And then they have a mental picture,

05:57.489 --> 06:02.091
“We’ll buy this.” All right? “And see so much we’ll spend.”

06:02.722 --> 06:04.922
And if they have to spend some money for something else,

06:05.042 --> 06:09.219
they get upset because they have decided to spend so much.

06:09.381 --> 06:12.024
So then they might go to spend some money.

06:12.144 --> 06:15.883
That’s also, you see how Mahamaya works, you see?

06:16.445 --> 06:20.571
It has happened with all of you.

06:20.691 --> 06:22.396
So they go and buy something.

06:22.516 --> 06:26.419
I’ll tell you Gavin bought once a image.

06:26.539 --> 06:29.932
I don’t know he paid about, I think 500 rupees

06:30.052 --> 06:33.129
no how much have you paid about 4,000 or I don’t know.

06:33.249 --> 06:35.050
How many pounds you paid for that?

06:35.170 --> 06:38.916
Gavin: Forty pounds.

06:39.036 --> 06:41.071
Forty pounds. He paid forty pounds for that thing.

06:41.191 --> 06:44.721
I would not even pay five pounds for that.

06:44.841 --> 06:46.696
And I said, “What’s this? How did you buy?”

06:46.696 --> 06:51.490
“Oh, it’s a very nice thing, Mother. We got it in Agra.”

06:51.610 --> 06:53.961
I said, “It is from Nepal. If you buy it in Agra,

06:54.081 --> 06:59.136
I think it is very expensive and it’s such a waste.”

06:59.256 --> 07:01.823
But the worst was the vibrations were very bad.

07:01.943 --> 07:04.284
They thought they’ve bought something great.

07:04.404 --> 07:07.716
And the vibrations were very bad and I noticed it.

07:07.836 --> 07:09.498
So he said, “All right, Mother. I’ll keep it in Your house

07:09.618 --> 07:11.395
and You improve the vibrations.” I tried.

07:11.515 --> 07:14.382
It would not work out. I said, “Gavin, what to do now?

07:14.502 --> 07:19.354
You sink it in the Thames. I don’t know what.”

07:22.500 --> 07:24.878
And then luckily it happened C.P. said that,

07:24.998 --> 07:28.231
“I have to take some present of Buddha to Japan.”

07:28.351 --> 07:31.632
I said, “These Japanese exhibitors are good for nothing.

07:31.752 --> 07:34.176
No bhoot is going to trouble them.”

07:34.296 --> 07:36.297
So he said, “Can I buy something?”

07:36.417 --> 07:39.188
I said, “Buddha’s things means it’s not easy to get here.”

07:39.308 --> 07:41.964
“But I have avlokhiteshwara. Would you like to take that?”

07:42.084 --> 07:43.056
He said, “What is the price?”

07:43.176 --> 07:46.699
I said, “Forty pounds.”

07:47.572 --> 07:50.774
He said, “All right. All right. I’ll take it.

07:50.894 --> 07:53.400
And he bought it for forty pounds.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.926
I said, “All right. Give it to the Japanese fellow.”

07:56.046 --> 07:59.696
He was a very nasty person. I said, “Good for him.”

08:01.647 --> 08:05.365
And I found it out that,

08:05.485 --> 08:10.307
you see because I knew that it will have some purpose somewhere.

08:10.682 --> 08:15.050
So this is how our mental images are so rigid

08:15.170 --> 08:20.262
that there’s no flexibility in our understanding.

08:20.382 --> 08:22.990
And if you start making it flexible then

08:23.132 --> 08:26.595
and this is very early stages when Gavin had gone to India,

08:26.715 --> 08:29.199
very early. Now he’s different.

08:29.319 --> 08:32.266
So if you become flexible,

08:32.386 --> 08:36.162
then what happens you see the joy of it.

08:36.282 --> 08:39.857
You see how things get adjusted. But if it is rigid,

08:39.977 --> 08:43.160
then you get caught up into your own rigidity.

08:43.280 --> 08:46.008
And you can never enjoy it,

08:46.128 --> 08:51.054
because there’s no movement for the Mahamaya power.

08:51.209 --> 08:53.450
And that’s how then you feel frustrated.

08:53.570 --> 08:56.292
You see it is all your own creation.

08:56.412 --> 09:00.325
The mental projection is your creation,

09:00.445 --> 09:06.268
and also the destruction is your creation.

09:06.843 --> 09:10.937
Nobody is responsible for that. You are responsible.

09:12.467 --> 09:15.372
But who does that is Mahamaya,

09:15.492 --> 09:19.277
“Sankalpa vikalpa karo”, you do decide something.

09:19.397 --> 09:23.522
You say, “Now today I will go to Birmingham.

09:23.642 --> 09:25.504
I have to go to Birmingham.

09:25.624 --> 09:30.949
I can’t come for a meditation. I have to.”

09:31.069 --> 09:32.446
After some time you will find

09:32.566 --> 09:35.744
that it’s impossible to do something,

09:35.864 --> 09:39.295
but to do what is needed for Sahaj Yoga.

09:39.415 --> 09:41.172
Because whenever you will try to do something,

09:41.292 --> 09:45.974
you will find it will frustrate you, it will upset you.

09:46.094 --> 09:49.830
If not, then it will make you realize

09:49.950 --> 09:53.077
what is important, what you’ve missed.

09:54.291 --> 09:58.551
Sometimes you get lost on the way.

09:58.671 --> 10:01.832
You think that, “Oh God. We have lost the way.

10:01.952 --> 10:05.063
What to do? Now where to go?”

10:08.160 --> 10:10.779
If I was you, I would say, “All right.

10:10.899 --> 10:13.431
We’ve lost the way. Must be to find something else.”

10:13.551 --> 10:17.248
And there I find something else which I’ve been looking for,

10:17.368 --> 10:23.328
for days together. I just see that there.

10:26.374 --> 10:34.783
So if you trust your joy giving quality of your Spirit,

10:36.358 --> 10:39.545
that you’re not going to lose that quality of the Spirit,

10:39.665 --> 10:42.117
at any cost.

10:42.833 --> 10:47.987
Then that acts as a guide

10:48.528 --> 10:54.579
and you understand the flexibility

10:54.699 --> 10:58.568
of all these worldly, transitory things.

10:59.609 --> 11:01.561
They are all changeable,

11:01.681 --> 11:06.301
only you cannot change because you are the Spirit.

11:09.697 --> 11:12.643
Today I wanted to talk about Mooladhara,

11:12.763 --> 11:16.943
which is very important subject.

11:18.998 --> 11:23.297
I think I have talked about it many a times.

11:23.417 --> 11:27.590
But in the West I must say,

11:27.710 --> 11:35.277
because of our wrong attitudes

11:39.060 --> 11:45.264
and the acceptance of wrong mental projections

11:45.384 --> 11:49.211
of other people who are very dominating,

11:50.147 --> 11:56.451
we have very much ruined our Mooladhara.

11:58.607 --> 12:02.470
Despite the fact that Kundalini has risen

12:02.590 --> 12:07.509
with whatever weaker power that Mooladhara had,

12:07.641 --> 12:11.043
and has sustained itself,

12:11.655 --> 12:17.025
we must know that we can always fall a trap

12:17.145 --> 12:26.441
to our different bifurcations which we had created before.

12:28.896 --> 12:32.673
It's a very serious matter

12:32.793 --> 12:39.187
that the Mooladhara chakra has been really shattered,

12:39.349 --> 12:43.753
and we have created pathways

12:43.873 --> 12:47.202
into which our attention can go

12:47.322 --> 12:50.929
if we are not very careful.

12:52.477 --> 12:56.250
Now supposing if somebody is a dishonest person,

12:56.370 --> 12:59.843
or a miserly person, or money oriented,

12:59.963 --> 13:05.968
it is very gross and you can see it so clearly.

13:06.795 --> 13:09.380
You see yourself and you get shocked how,

13:09.507 --> 13:13.625
“Why did I say such a thing? Why did I do such a thing?”

13:17.258 --> 13:24.694
But when it comes to the left side nonsense,

13:24.814 --> 13:27.566
sin against the Mother,

13:29.989 --> 13:35.845
it's a secretive action

13:35.965 --> 13:39.892
that's only between you and yourself.

13:40.710 --> 13:45.874
Nobody knows what goes on in your mind, except for you.

13:46.492 --> 13:50.684
Nobody knows what you are going to do

13:51.692 --> 13:58.309
next moment in your privacy when you are alone.

13:59.392 --> 14:03.587
Nobody can look into you except for your Mother.

14:03.707 --> 14:07.012
I also only feel your Mooladharas.

14:07.132 --> 14:10.337
To be very frank with you,

14:10.457 --> 14:15.647
that's one center I find it difficult to feel Myself.

14:15.767 --> 14:23.534
The reason is, I have a very, very strong Mooladhara,

14:26.115 --> 14:31.213
which is not so sensitive, I would say.

14:32.018 --> 14:33.611
It is not bothered.

14:33.737 --> 14:38.059
The attention of My Mooladhara doesn't go

14:38.179 --> 14:41.764
near any other Mooladhara. It just recedes back,

14:41.884 --> 14:43.988
that's the action it plays all the time.

14:44.108 --> 14:48.071
So I also, unless and until it is very badly off,

14:48.191 --> 14:50.638
I mean the person is very close to Me,

14:50.758 --> 14:52.858
then I feel the Mooladhara very strongly.

14:52.978 --> 14:55.767
But still I can?

14:55.887 --> 15:00.441
Supposing you give Me something, that thing is used by you,

15:00.561 --> 15:03.914
immediately I can feel it.

15:04.546 --> 15:10.196
So the correction of Mooladhara entirely depends on you.

15:10.316 --> 15:13.997
And without a strong Mooladhara you cannot rise high,

15:14.117 --> 15:16.454
do what you like.

15:18.910 --> 15:23.538
Now for people who are Indian,

15:23.658 --> 15:27.323
who have respected their Mooladharas,

15:27.443 --> 15:30.264
there are so many methods and ways given

15:30.384 --> 15:37.447
how to raise the power of Mooladhara.

15:37.567 --> 15:41.314
But that won't work out with the Western people,

15:41.434 --> 15:45.054
because it's a damaged one.

15:45.174 --> 15:48.921
It's one which is a shattered one,

15:49.041 --> 15:52.597
and which does not work on the physical side of the Mooladhara,

15:52.717 --> 15:56.794
but on the emotional side as we call the “Mana”,

15:56.914 --> 16:00.568
the left side.

16:02.482 --> 16:07.976
So, even you may not talk in that way,

16:08.096 --> 16:13.210
but your mind is still in that realm.

16:13.770 --> 16:17.796
And you still think on that realm.

16:17.916 --> 16:22.880
Even mentally, you are in it.

16:24.150 --> 16:27.971
Or you are seeing things,

16:28.091 --> 16:30.988
wanting to see such things,

16:31.108 --> 16:34.426
wanting to enjoy such things.

16:34.546 --> 16:38.706
That lurking attraction is still there,

16:38.826 --> 16:42.026
your Mooladhara cannot strengthen.

16:43.710 --> 16:49.439
And we have to realize that I'm talking to Western people.

16:49.559 --> 16:54.287
I would not say the same to the people from India.

16:55.690 --> 16:59.866
So now we have to work out much harder.

16:59.986 --> 17:06.413
To be on the watch-out, to deal with yourself.

17:06.533 --> 17:12.631
And it is more a mental activity.

17:15.080 --> 17:19.227
“Mental” meaning I mean the emotional side.

17:19.347 --> 17:22.153
You have to watch your mind.

17:22.273 --> 17:26.926
In English, it's a very funny word “mind” is. But “Mana”,

17:27.046 --> 17:34.630
through which we cater to our emotional side, to our desires.

17:36.482 --> 17:38.983
Where is it going?

17:39.103 --> 17:42.143
Where is this movement of our mind?

17:42.263 --> 17:44.914
What is it doing?

17:45.034 --> 17:47.776
You have to stand against your mind,

17:47.896 --> 17:50.616
stand against your desires,

17:50.736 --> 17:52.796
or you can face it

17:52.916 --> 17:58.386
and see for yourself clearly what's happening.

17:59.324 --> 18:02.818
It's for you to decide.

18:02.956 --> 18:07.352
Nobody is going to correct you on this point.

18:07.472 --> 18:10.141
I know you people have been confessing to Me.

18:10.261 --> 18:12.484
I never read your letters, to be very frank.

18:12.604 --> 18:15.459
Whatever letters you sent, I would not read it.

18:15.579 --> 18:17.416
Whatever confessions you have made,

18:17.536 --> 18:19.936
I burnt all those letters.

18:20.056 --> 18:23.913
I haven't got any idea as to what you did.

18:24.033 --> 18:26.215
Nor do I want to know about it.

18:26.335 --> 18:29.776
That's not My concern.

18:29.896 --> 18:34.063
My concern is that now

18:34.183 --> 18:41.823
you do not dwell upon the same ideas,

18:42.816 --> 18:46.692
on the same level,

18:46.812 --> 18:51.293
or on any level whatsoever, we can say.

18:53.466 --> 18:57.496
It is in thoughtless awareness you can combat

18:57.616 --> 19:00.690
the thoughts that come to you

19:00.810 --> 19:03.178
from wrong type of Mooladhara.

19:03.298 --> 19:07.819
Maybe some of you have got bhoots on your Mooladhara.

19:08.852 --> 19:14.451
And we have some physical treatment for such bhoots also,

19:15.790 --> 19:19.185
which I'll tell to Gavin sometime,

19:19.305 --> 19:21.544
which you can ask.

19:21.664 --> 19:23.437
But you cannot always say that,

19:23.557 --> 19:26.137
“It is a bhoot and I'm all right. I'm away from the bhoot.”

19:26.257 --> 19:29.076
You are not. Whenever you say, “I have a bhoot,”

19:29.203 --> 19:33.727
means you yourself you’re siding with the bhoot.

19:38.674 --> 19:47.051
You see a person as a Sakshi.

19:47.171 --> 19:50.777
That means you see that person

19:50.897 --> 19:55.309
but you do not get a reaction,

19:55.429 --> 20:02.060
which is killer of joy.

20:04.369 --> 20:10.026
You yourself can feel your Mooladharas very well.

20:10.146 --> 20:18.064
You can feel it on your fingertips also.

20:18.237 --> 20:21.372
And be alert about it.

20:21.492 --> 20:25.347
If you want to be kind to yourself,

20:25.529 --> 20:31.423
know that you have to divert your attention

20:31.543 --> 20:34.630
towards a sane married life.

20:34.750 --> 20:38.752
But also that should not be too much.

20:38.872 --> 20:41.730
Because what I have learnt now,

20:41.850 --> 20:45.542
that in the West people have devised methods

20:45.710 --> 20:48.071
of transferring their attention

20:48.191 --> 20:51.982
from one person to another.

20:52.303 --> 20:55.955
Mental acrobatics of different type

20:56.075 --> 21:01.803
they have devised to destroy their pure attention.

21:01.923 --> 21:06.176
Don’t play onto these.

21:10.942 --> 21:14.943
There are so many other things by which

21:15.063 --> 21:19.165
we express that we are still under the trap

21:19.285 --> 21:21.119
of a bad Mooladhara.

21:21.239 --> 21:23.554
The way you dress up, the way you walk,

21:23.674 --> 21:27.147
the way you sit, the way you talk,

21:27.267 --> 21:38.488
the way you behave, to impress other people.

21:39.962 --> 21:45.287
I am to be impressed by other people in Sahaja Yoga itself.

21:45.407 --> 21:48.439
The only impression that should really work

21:48.559 --> 21:54.978
is the height of ascent that others have achieved.

21:57.004 --> 21:59.557
You can do it; it's not difficult.

21:59.677 --> 22:03.298
When the Kundalini can rise with all such shattered

22:03.418 --> 22:08.127
Mooladharas, I'm sure you can cure your Mooladhara completely.

22:08.262 --> 22:12.509
But your question is first of all

22:12.629 --> 22:15.306
of strengthening the Mooladhara,

22:15.426 --> 22:21.131
for which I think you all have to go into a kind of tapasya.

22:22.292 --> 22:24.669
That's why I say sometimes

22:24.789 --> 22:29.001
that the Western people should take to less of meat,

22:29.121 --> 22:33.829
especially the red meats and beefs,

22:33.949 --> 22:38.716
and horses, and dogs

22:40.770 --> 22:44.924
and I don't know what else you eat.

22:48.914 --> 22:51.896
Take more to vegetarian food.

22:52.016 --> 22:55.536
I'm not saying vegetarianism, you understand that.

22:55.656 --> 22:57.232
Take more to things

22:57.352 --> 23:01.077
which do not give you so much heat in the body.

23:02.657 --> 23:06.730
Even fish is very [inaudible].

23:07.589 --> 23:11.739
So take to a life which is in a way ascetic,

23:11.859 --> 23:17.400
but don't take to these horrible health foods also.

23:17.536 --> 23:19.900
I can't tolerate them I tell you.

23:20.020 --> 23:23.249
They're not meant for human beings, but for animals I think.

23:23.369 --> 23:28.017
They churn your stomach completely, and it's horrible.

23:28.137 --> 23:32.622
This Country Store thing I took once and I said “had enough of it!”

23:32.884 --> 23:36.616
Country Store - the whole country went into My stomach.

23:40.820 --> 23:43.356
So for you people,

23:43.507 --> 23:45.739
(You have to go?)

23:46.289 --> 23:55.148
Those who are suffering from Mooladhara must know

23:55.306 --> 24:00.733
that food does make a difference

24:00.853 --> 24:04.643
in the powers of Mooladhara.

24:05.267 --> 24:09.365
So if you have to get it cured, first of all

24:09.485 --> 24:13.021
you have to soothe it down, it is over-excited,

24:13.141 --> 24:15.765
over-excited.

24:15.885 --> 24:18.444
Any man you touch, any woman you touch,

24:18.564 --> 24:20.137
any woman you look at ...

24:20.257 --> 24:23.761
I just don't understand, it's worse than monkeys.

24:24.245 --> 24:26.218
Horrible.

24:26.338 --> 24:29.599
You have to soothe it down, cool it down,

24:29.719 --> 24:35.217
so that Ganesha bestows His blessings upon your Mooladhara.

24:35.337 --> 24:37.980
There's no grace.

24:38.100 --> 24:41.391
But it's not so outside that I can say that,

24:41.511 --> 24:44.536
“you must respect yourself.”

24:44.656 --> 24:48.265
It cannot work out with those words I know.

24:52.882 --> 24:56.909
You have to sit down,

24:57.029 --> 25:03.039
do meditation and try to soothe it down.

25:05.926 --> 25:07.651
I'll discuss with Gavin and I’ll tell him

25:07.771 --> 25:09.170
what things can be done about it,

25:09.290 --> 25:13.134
because I can't tell you in the open like this.

25:13.254 --> 25:17.303
But still this is all physical.

25:17.423 --> 25:22.401
Mentally you must be on the watch

25:22.521 --> 25:26.932
to see where does this mind go - to dirty things.

25:27.074 --> 25:31.970
Why does it always go to this sensation?

25:32.476 --> 25:39.333
See the birds, see the flowers, see the nature,

25:39.453 --> 25:45.159
see the beautiful people, just see them.

25:47.081 --> 25:49.283
Another horrible thing in the West

25:49.403 --> 25:51.872
is that the women must expose their body

25:51.992 --> 25:54.273
to get men excited.

25:54.393 --> 25:56.331
Men do the same I think.

25:56.451 --> 25:58.100
They always try to excite each other

25:58.220 --> 26:02.042
and live in a stupid excitement.

26:05.233 --> 26:10.292
You have to expose beautiful things, like flowers,

26:10.412 --> 26:13.259
beautiful ornaments.

26:13.379 --> 26:18.273
All right? But you're not a thing!

26:20.794 --> 26:30.105
It's your private property.

26:30.638 --> 26:34.949
You don't put all your gold on the streets, do you?

26:35.069 --> 26:38.197
Better try that, sometimes.

26:38.317 --> 26:41.746
You will mind people plundering your gold,

26:41.866 --> 26:45.446
but you don't mind your chastity being plundered.

26:45.566 --> 26:49.352
Everyone looking at you with dirty eyes.

26:49.472 --> 26:51.374
You don't feel insulted?

26:51.494 --> 26:55.274
Because ego is a dirty stuff. It does not mind.

26:55.394 --> 26:59.747
It feels happy that people are watching you.

27:02.302 --> 27:04.135
They are plundering you.

27:04.255 --> 27:07.734
They are looting your chastity.

27:12.509 --> 27:15.929
But Sahaja Yogis are not like that.

27:16.049 --> 27:20.571
But still I must say you must cleanse your hearts,

27:20.691 --> 27:26.913
cleanse your minds, take yourself out of it.

27:31.968 --> 27:36.404
The minds are very funnily placed,

27:36.524 --> 27:40.171
and that's why the greatest complications there are

27:40.291 --> 27:43.458
in the brains of people.

27:43.578 --> 27:46.764
They are very confused,

27:46.884 --> 27:50.474
very confused people.

27:50.807 --> 27:53.920
Because there is no wisdom in this kind of life.

27:54.040 --> 27:59.093
You become just a sex-oriented personality.

28:00.089 --> 28:03.065
It is actually just the other way round.

28:03.185 --> 28:06.925
If you are money-oriented, you want to preserve money.

28:07.045 --> 28:10.188
If you are possession-oriented you want to preserve it.

28:10.308 --> 28:13.401
If you get one little antique piece you want to preserve it.

28:13.521 --> 28:15.960
And why not this property of yours

28:16.080 --> 28:17.700
which is the highest of all,

28:17.820 --> 28:21.624
to be preserved, to be adorned,

28:21.744 --> 28:24.566
to be worshipped?

28:28.953 --> 28:31.919
I'm quite worried on that point

28:32.039 --> 28:38.362
that secretly people are indulging into such things.

28:38.482 --> 28:40.531
And they’re hypocritical sometimes,

28:40.651 --> 28:42.834
they don't mind being hypocritical about it.

28:42.954 --> 28:45.497
They are Sahaja Yogis, all right,

28:45.617 --> 28:48.236
but in this matter they think they can go about

28:48.356 --> 28:51.098
the way they like. And sometimes some of them say that

28:51.218 --> 28:55.166
“Mother has said it’s all right.” I never said so!

28:55.286 --> 28:59.454
There's one point I cannot compromise is this.

29:00.733 --> 29:03.560
You must have a chaste outlook towards yourself,

29:03.680 --> 29:06.268
towards your life, towards your being,

29:06.388 --> 29:10.323
towards your personality. You are saints.

29:11.159 --> 29:14.060
And if a saint doesn't have a good character,

29:14.180 --> 29:17.083
I call it the character, the essence of character,

29:17.203 --> 29:19.811
is not a saint.

29:24.205 --> 29:26.942
So this purity has to be maintained.

29:27.062 --> 29:30.455
There cannot be any compromise on that.

29:30.575 --> 29:34.547
You cannot hit at the roots of everything.

29:35.268 --> 29:38.752
If it works out,

29:38.932 --> 29:43.498
in a collective way, nobody cheats oneself,

29:43.618 --> 29:46.779
nobody deceives oneself

29:47.424 --> 29:51.349
and put the mind into right track of ascent.

29:51.469 --> 29:54.685
Thinking about the ascent, how you are going to rise,

29:54.805 --> 29:57.325
thinking of the moments when you had the joys,

29:57.445 --> 29:59.968
thinking of the day where you met Me first,

30:00.088 --> 30:04.351
thinking of all the other beautiful and holy things,

30:04.471 --> 30:08.468
your mind can be cleansed.

30:09.153 --> 30:12.671
And whenever such a thought comes in, you have to say,

30:12.791 --> 30:16.750
“not this, not this, not this.”

30:17.636 --> 30:21.727
It's more mental than physical, I tell you.

30:22.958 --> 30:25.507
I know it's difficult,

30:25.627 --> 30:29.874
but if you can get realization why not this also?

30:32.012 --> 30:33.909
You all have to understand

30:34.029 --> 30:36.456
that there is no compromise on this.

30:36.576 --> 30:39.464
And a day may come, if you continue with it,

30:39.584 --> 30:41.934
you will be thrown away completely,

30:42.054 --> 30:46.434
just like any other devil is thrown out.

30:48.610 --> 30:51.396
So there is no compromise. Tell yourself,

30:51.516 --> 30:55.036
don't deceive yourself, don't cheat yourself.

30:55.162 --> 30:56.794
You cannot ascend

30:56.914 --> 31:00.885
if there is any lurking thing within you.

31:01.005 --> 31:04.003
You will be dragged down, because that's your weakness,

31:04.123 --> 31:08.728
and you will become weaker, and weaker and weaker.

31:09.161 --> 31:12.842
Only question is “where is your attention?”

31:12.962 --> 31:18.265
Divert. Divert your attention.

31:20.748 --> 31:25.386
First you will need some exercise, some effort,

31:25.506 --> 31:31.768
and afterwards it will come automatically.

31:31.888 --> 31:35.539
You won't have to exert, you won't have to worry.

31:35.659 --> 31:38.549
On the contrary,

31:39.582 --> 31:43.654
it will become impossible how to be otherwise.

31:45.549 --> 31:47.991
So much conditioning is there.

31:48.111 --> 31:51.604
We have played into the hands of conditioning,

31:51.870 --> 31:54.730
we have ruined ourselves.

31:54.850 --> 31:57.459
This conditioning is the subtlest of all,

31:57.579 --> 32:00.516
and the worst of all.

32:00.636 --> 32:04.120
It’s impossible to combat in Sahaja Yoga,

32:04.240 --> 32:06.131
unless and until you individually

32:06.282 --> 32:10.338
take up the responsibility of looking after it.

32:15.917 --> 32:19.238
Mooladhara is one of the most delicate,

32:19.358 --> 32:23.959
and the most powerful chakra.

32:24.700 --> 32:32.517
It has so many folds and it has so many dimensions.

32:34.676 --> 32:39.820
If your Mooladhara is not all right, your memory will fail.

32:39.940 --> 32:42.794
If your Mooladhara is not all right, to begin with,

32:42.914 --> 32:45.854
your wisdom will fail.

32:49.891 --> 32:52.826
You will have no sense of direction.

32:52.946 --> 32:56.700
The insanity that is now crawling up in America

32:56.820 --> 32:58.793
before they become forty years of age

32:58.913 --> 33:01.454
is because their Mooladharas are out.

33:01.574 --> 33:04.997
Most of the diseases which are incurable

33:05.117 --> 33:09.283
come because of weak Mooladharas,

33:11.280 --> 33:12.718
on the physical side.

33:12.838 --> 33:14.841
On the mental side,

33:14.961 --> 33:18.135
most of the mental problems we saw there,

33:18.255 --> 33:23.919
most, I would say ninety percent,

33:24.039 --> 33:26.463
are due to weak Mooladhara.

33:26.583 --> 33:29.584
If a person has a strong Mooladhara,

33:29.704 --> 33:32.766
powerful Mooladhara,

33:32.886 --> 33:35.686
it doesn't get into trouble.

33:35.806 --> 33:38.724
Because you know there's a very strong hold

33:38.844 --> 33:42.409
of the Mooladhara in the back there.

33:42.529 --> 33:47.845
And when your mind goes off,

33:50.954 --> 33:54.000
you blame the brain.

33:54.208 --> 33:59.435
It's not the brain, mostly it is the Mooladhara.

33:59.555 --> 34:03.578
So for physical safety and for your emotional safety also,

34:03.698 --> 34:11.689
you have to have a sane type of attitude towards Mooladhara.

34:13.442 --> 34:17.226
That's why I'm very anxious that you all should get married,

34:17.346 --> 34:20.432
and after marriage, after a few days, you find

34:20.552 --> 34:26.826
that your attention starts diverting to other problems of married life.

34:28.992 --> 34:33.609
But not if you are not a Sahaja Yogi,

34:34.336 --> 34:38.340
because the sensationalization

34:38.460 --> 34:41.783
has become the main theme of modern life.

34:41.903 --> 34:48.402
And you are tossed about on the rough sea

34:48.522 --> 34:52.687
of all these deliberate actions of the people.

34:52.807 --> 35:00.866
Media, books, ideas, everything,

35:01.239 --> 35:07.219
creates this horrible excitable temperament within you.

35:10.289 --> 35:12.491
Such a person doesn't have any patience,

35:12.611 --> 35:17.573
doesn't have any balance.

35:18.083 --> 35:20.241
Actually he's hypocritical,

35:20.361 --> 35:24.853
and has a very bad left Vishuddhi.

35:24.973 --> 35:28.185
So many complications take place with this.

35:28.318 --> 35:32.335
Before realization, forget the past.

35:33.107 --> 35:35.506
Whatever you have done, forget it.

35:35.626 --> 35:38.000
Just don't worry.

35:38.120 --> 35:40.037
But remember one thing,

35:40.157 --> 35:42.926
that you have damaged your Mooladhara.

35:43.046 --> 35:46.172
So you have to look after it, you have to soothe it down,

35:46.292 --> 35:48.742
you have to bring it to normalcy.

35:48.862 --> 35:54.397
You have to make it a healthy,

35:55.920 --> 36:00.720
balanced center,

36:00.868 --> 36:07.029
so that Shri Ganesha can rule over it.

36:10.360 --> 36:14.338
Talking about Shri Ganesha,

36:14.458 --> 36:19.026
you know vibrations become too much for Me.

36:20.055 --> 36:22.492
We talk of innocence,

36:22.612 --> 36:25.329
but to awaken innocence within ourselves

36:25.449 --> 36:30.119
we must be on the full watch,

36:30.239 --> 36:35.397
on the full alertness about our minds.

36:35.517 --> 36:38.154
What is it thinking? Where is it going?

36:38.274 --> 36:40.497
Where is this thief going?

36:40.617 --> 36:43.179
Is he trying to do some tricks?

36:43.299 --> 36:46.817
Is he up to some tricks? All right!

36:46.937 --> 36:50.767
You have to be alert, very alert.

36:51.377 --> 36:55.286
I’ve been thinking of talking about it since long.

36:55.406 --> 36:58.372
But now I have to tell you one thing.

36:58.497 --> 37:00.089
That you'll be exposed.

37:00.209 --> 37:02.879
That is another quality of Mahamaya.

37:02.999 --> 37:04.929
She'll expose you.

37:05.049 --> 37:07.906
You'll be exposed

37:08.026 --> 37:11.585
if you try to play tricks with Me.

37:11.744 --> 37:14.225
“With Me” means with your Kundalini.

37:14.345 --> 37:17.039
If you try to play tricks with your Kundalini,

37:17.159 --> 37:19.769
you'll be exposed.

37:19.889 --> 37:23.130
And you'll be ashamed of yourself.

37:24.017 --> 37:28.184
So please be careful, very careful about it,

37:28.304 --> 37:34.548
that you again make your Mooladhara very healthy,

37:34.668 --> 37:37.685
and powerful.

37:37.827 --> 37:41.110
May God bless you!

37:48.541 --> 37:51.257
So our prayer should be that

37:51.377 --> 37:56.347
“Let our Mooladhara be healthy and strong.”

37:56.467 --> 37:59.932
That's all. Let’s pray.

38:12.090 --> 38:14.805
There are certain exercises for Mooladhara.

38:14.925 --> 38:21.018
I will explain to Gavin who is your leader in England.

38:21.138 --> 38:22.896
Then he will pass it on to you.

38:23.016 --> 38:28.657
It should be done verbally. It should not be written down.

38:28.777 --> 38:31.840
The leaders of the ashrams and other places

38:31.960 --> 38:36.540
should come and see him every month sometime,

38:36.660 --> 38:40.912
and these things should be talked.

38:42.783 --> 38:46.641
Because it's a secret,

38:46.761 --> 38:48.124
not to be discussed openly.

38:48.244 --> 38:52.109
It's a secret, between you and yourself.

38:53.510 --> 38:56.693
It should not be written down anywhere.

38:56.813 --> 38:58.962
It should not be mentioned,

38:59.082 --> 39:02.526
but should be worked out by all of you,

39:02.646 --> 39:08.256
in such a way that you enjoy the bliss of Shri Ganesha.

39:09.961 --> 39:13.961
Is more for the ladies, I would say, than for the men.

39:14.081 --> 39:18.299
Because men suffer much more than women do.

39:20.569 --> 39:24.410
And that's why women must be very careful.

39:24.530 --> 39:29.587
Develop very good relationships with your brothers.

39:32.764 --> 39:41.507
Unless and until you really establish your high character,

39:41.627 --> 39:45.319
men cannot be improved.

39:46.080 --> 39:48.655
You have seen in India women don’t like it

39:48.775 --> 39:51.057
if anyone tries to look at them, or tries to touch them.

39:51.177 --> 39:52.874
They don't like it.

39:52.994 --> 39:56.303
Women have killed themselves, burnt themselves up,

39:56.423 --> 40:00.827
thousands of them, because they thought some

40:01.007 --> 40:05.189
other people may come and touch their body.

40:06.445 --> 40:14.090
It's so related to your Atma, to your Spirit.

40:14.761 --> 40:17.693
As if it is the body,

40:17.853 --> 40:21.054
innocence is the body of your Spirit.

40:26.248 --> 40:30.697
You all can be that, because you have become yoginis now.

40:30.817 --> 40:34.622
They were not yoginis, but they knew one thing

40:34.742 --> 40:38.545
the power of their chastity.

40:39.475 --> 40:41.877
It's more for ladies here,

40:41.997 --> 40:47.144
that they should try to generate that feeling

40:47.264 --> 40:50.880
of nobility, of chastity,

40:51.000 --> 40:53.681
of holiness around them,

40:53.801 --> 40:59.085
so that the men themselves respect them

40:59.323 --> 41:03.857
and develop that feeling within themselves.

41:08.007 --> 41:10.567
Thank you very much.
